Composed by J. 
H. 
MACK for J. W. Monros, of the "BIG 
FOUR." 
While rowing on the lake one night, 
I 
heard the splash of oars, 
And seeing a 
lady gliding by, 
I 
rowed my boat to hers; 
The spray's sweet sound, as we went on 
Bewitching coal-black eyes, 
Enchanting scenes I'll ne'er forget, 
Beneath the starry sky. 
Cnoitus. 
Dip, dip, our oars we bent, 
Until the boats closed tight, 
Leaning over on one side. 
Kissing in the moonlight. 
(Repeat.) 
" 
Oh, sir," said she, " you're impolite, 
An advantage to take like this 
In following me out on the lake, 
You've surely went amiss;" 
And then a 
smile so very sweet, 
Stole o'er her pretty face, 
Then leaning to her oars again, 
Said for another race. 
Dip, dip, kc. 
The moon's bright rays shone on the lake, 
It was eternal bliss, 
I 
believed the words that I 
had heard--
There is magic in a 
kiss. 
Like flying birds our boats sped on, 
I 
rowed with all my might, 
To gain the shore in time to help 
My darling to alight.

I'm Chancy the " Masher," a 
swell superfine, 
My garments are made in the latest design, 
I 
wear a 
large diamond and gloves rather small, 
My manner, so graceful, is pleasing to all. 
I'm just like a 
count, or a 
lord or a 
duke, 
But some vulgar fellows will call me a " fluke;" 
I'm sure they don't know me, just walk on Broadway, 
And all the young ladies will instantly say— 
CHORUS. 
I'm Charley the " Masher," the gayest of swells, 
I 
play the piano, and chat with the belles; 
Wherever I 
go, I'm the girl's " little pet," 
l'm Charley the " Masher," now don't you forget! 
I 
live at my leisure—do nothing all day— 
At night, look for pleasure and go to the play; 
I 
call on Miss Flimsey and chat for awhile, 
Dear creature, she's rich, and her Pa's only child! 
She's highly accomplished, in fact she's bora ton, 
But there's her big brother, whose name it is John, 
lie comes in the parlor and waits till I 
go, 
It's deucedly awkward, but I 
let him know— 
I'm Charley, etc. 
I 
wear a 
red rose in my swallow- tail coat, 
And great standing collars encircle my throat; 
I " hang up" my tailor till fortune is kind, 
When dressed up in style many friends I 
can find. 
Of sweet conversation I 
have a 
great flow, 
I'm known everywhere as an excellent beau! 
The wealth and the fashion invite me to dance, 
For Charley the " Masher" their hearts can entrance. 
I'm Charley, etc.

Sung by the new "BIG FOUR." 
White folks give Inc your attention, 
While I 
sing to you my song, 
it's about a 
gal I'm gwine to mention, 
And I 
promise not to detain you long, 
l've been courting her for many a

And to her house T

In her stocking feet she stands five foot, 
And weighs 1 
50 pounds. 
CHORUS. 
Come all you figs and join together, 
Band the banjo down and we'll have a 
dance, 
I'm gwine to be married next Sunday eve, 
To my great big tall and greasy Sue. 
I 
have got my ma's consent, 
My father feels quite satisfied, 
Next Sunday eve I'll take his arm, 
And to the church we all shall glide. 
And then when we are both united, 
We'll own a 
house and coach and four, 
And won't it be gay to see every day, 
Our little Lappells playing on the floor. 
Come all you nigs, &e. 
Oh, Sue, I'm glad you got consent 
And what a 
happy pair well make, 
What funny names to be called out of church, 
George Lappell and Susan Flake. 
Then you'll be my wife forever, 
And lots of things for you I'll buy; 
I'll never go back on George Lappell, 
Until the very day I 
die. 
Come all you figs, &e.

'An original song, written by HARRY BENNE 11 
for 
JonN PENDT. 
In this the great city, queer sights I 
have seen. 
And from them a 
song I 
have managed to glean; 
And when you have heard it, no doubt you'll agree, 
That thin!--s 
in town are not as they should be; 
In the first place, we hear a 
report every day, 
They're going to give us a 
Rapid Transit Railway ; • 
But unless they soon do it, between you and me, 
Things in this town. are not as they should be. 
CHORUS. 
In New York, New York, 
The place of renown, 
New York City, 
The famous old town. 
The great social evil to- day. l've no doubt, 
Is the poor homeless tramp, who goes wandering about. 
He cannot find shelter or food, if he tries: 
What cares the cold world, if he sickens and dies; 
Perhaps in his youth, he'd a 
bright happy home, 
But cruel misfortune has caused him to roam; 
If he can't get employment. he must steal you see, 
Which shows things are not just as they should be. 
In New York, etc. 
Boss Tweed is a 
man most talked about now, 
His departure last winter caused a 
crest row; 
Of course we all know it was not a 
square game, 
But show me the man who would not do the same; 
When Sweeny, Genet and Dick Connelly took flight. 
Ile stood here alone and made a 
good fight; 
He did wrong., but when poor men were g,rzatly in need. 
The first to assist them. was William M. Tweed. 
In New York. New York, 
The place of renew a, 
in this famous '• Gotham" 
And glorious old town.

Price 10c. 
Saratoga's the place for a.season of joy, 
The home of the gay darling belle, 
To flirt on the sly, 'math the bright slimmer sky, 
And live in the finest hotel; 
I've been there myself, and have fallen in love, 
And reaped a 
true lover's reward ; 
The lady I 
met, I 
shall never forget, 
She was known there as beautiful Maud, 
CHORUS. 
She's the belle of gay Saratoga, 
She is tall and fair, with a 
queenly air1 
When she goes by all the swells they stare, 
And they call her beautiful Maud! 
No doubt you have been to that charming resort, 
When fashion has ever full sway; 
there you will find pretty ladies to court, 
You're lost if you fall in their way. 
But none can compare with this darling of mine, 
, When she sings all the people applaud! 
Of all the sweet girls, with their roses and pearls, 
The dearest is beautiful Maud! 
She's the belle, & c. 
' 
The sweet music sounds and we rush to the ball, 
To join in the waltz and quadrille ; 
Then one little stroll, where the bright moon- beams fall, 
And the air is enchantingly still. 
(A sweet kiss of rapture and vows of true love, 
Next season we'll travel abroad, 
What more need I 
say? soon a 
bright wedding day 
Will be dawning for beautiful Maud ! 
She's the belle, St.e.

Jump in, jump in, my Kitty dear, 
We're going to have a

The night is bright and cold and clear, 
It's going to be a 
gay ride. 
Thro' Central Park and Harlem Lane, 
We'll soon be swiftly speeding, 
jump in, jump in, my Kitty dear, 
The race we'll soon be leading! 
CHORUS. 
Sleighing on a

Dashing thro' the snow, 
Full of laughter and delight. 
Singing as we go; 
Rosy cheeks and laughing eyes. 
Tales of love they show, 
Sleighing on a 
starry night. 
Dashing thro' the snow. 
I 
care not how the wind may blow, 
I 
care not how it freezes, 
My little girl is at my side, 
And don't she get some squeezes! 
Our sleigh is dashing up the road, 
And gay the bells are jingling, 
While eyes are bright and hearts are light, 
With love and laughter mingling. 
Sleighing on a 
starry night, etc. 
I 
ask my Kitty is she cold, 
She softly whispers " Yes, dear !" 
The only comfort I 
can give 
Is just one sweet caress, dear! 
I 
talk of love, but Kitty thinks 
The time is not well chosen, 
She says, " My darling, mind the horse, 
My feet are nearly frozen!"

On any moonlight evening may be seen; 
Though if they want a 
lark, they have it in the dark, 
And they " do it," though they say " they didn't mean," 
When creeping down the stairs, comes the old man unawares, 
And kissing catch the couple in the act; 
The mother, from above, says " Don't interfere, my love, 
You can't dispute this most important fact—" 
They all do it, etc. 
Old women do declare, girls should never dye their hair, 
And then again they say it's very wrong; 
Without the least restraint, their faces so to paint, 
And rob the easy chair for their chignon. 
Each girl a 
little puff, has inside a 
little muff, 
They are never seen without it, night or day; 
And her pretty nose she'll powder, if a 
moment is allowed her, 
When, if you laugh, she'll innocently say— 
They all do it, etc, 
But what does most impress, is the style in which they dress, 
It's enough to make you laugh when them you see; 
They've a 
hat upon their heads, large enough to make up beds, 
For pussy cats with kittens two or three. 
In their panniers, too, behind, if examined you would find, 
The most important papers of the day; 
The Chronicle and Chimes, the Telegraph and Times, 
Or anything that chance puts in their way. 
They all do it, etc. 
There's my neighbor, Dinah Down, brught two lovely boys to 
town, 
And her husband gets but one pound one per week; 
You often hear him say, " If things go on this way, 
We'll a 
lodging in the Union have to seek! 
For the doctor and the nurse, will drain my scanty purse, 
With many more expenses to defray;" 
Then he gets into a 
passion, when they tell him " it's the 
fashion," 
And they soothe him as they sing this truthful lay— 
They all do it, etc.

you'll Miss Me When I'm Gone. 
As sung by T. M . 
HENGLEa. 
I 
am growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray ; 
My limbs are weak and painful— 
Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone. 
CHORUS. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
When fin gone, you will miss me ; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
What will you do without me 
When Winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms around you, 
As I 
have often done ? 
Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
When I 
above have flown? 
You'll know where you can find me, 
nit you'll miss me when I'm gone. 
When I'm gone, &c.

PRETTY AS PICTURE. 
As sung by MecioN & W ILSON. 
OH I 
my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She is the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
Her smile has quite undone me, 
I'm her only beau, she told me so, 
When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And her voice is just the cage, where the ;ittle °acts are 
• singing, 
She's the sweetest, and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
Her darling face nas won me, 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
An angel without wings. 
When ' twas time to go, we talked so slow 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport, ' twas cupid's cat 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
loved her so, as I 
turned to go. 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she dropped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you au-revoir, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And my heart is a 
golden frame, whenever yountay axle 
her, 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture all the while. 
Oh, my heart, &e.

LEA.NING ON A 
BALCONY. 
Music published by E. Hardlug, 2SS Bowery N. Y. 
'Tis pleasant on a 
summer night. 
I 
think you won't deny, 
When stars, like wicked laughing eyes, 
Are winking in the sky ; 
With some one by your side whose eyes 
Are bright as any star, 
To lean upon a 
balcony 
Enjoying your cigar. 
CHORUS. 
Leaning on a 
balcony, 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
Talking- to a 
pretty girl, 
Heedless of her pa ; 
Though some may like to strut about, 
I 
like it better far, 
Leaning on a 
balcony 
Smoking a 
cigar. 
You'rc glad to leave the crowded roork 
And if the night be fair, 
To lean upon a 
balcony . 
To get a 
breath of air; 
And if you've some one by your side, 
She won't take it amiss, 
if, in a 
quiet sort of way, 
You steal a 
little kiss. 
Leaning on a 
ha:con3-, ete. 
When curtains screer. you from the room, 
And nobody can see, 
To pop tile question quietly, 
What better place can be 
The coldest- hearted must relent, 
You very soon will find, 
For girls upon a 
balcony 
Have never proved unkind.

Words and Music by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The Sun had just gone dowh, 
While leisurely meandering 
A 
little way from town ; 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue, 
Beneath her dark eye-lashes, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
A 
smile was all she gave me, 
But how it did enslave me, 
'Twas love, the first I 
knew ; 
There's some sweet charm entrancing 
Within her eyes so blue, 
A 
dreamy, soft expression, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
By Wm. H. DELEHANTY. 
I 
followed on behind her. 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet reminder, 
Her handkerchief it fell ; 
I 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one corner there I 
found. 
(sYmPb-
MY DEW DROP PEARL. 
Yes, they ask me why I 
always seem so happy, 
And they criticize my gay and airy style, 
But they know not how I 
love a 
little beauty ; 
I'm swimming in the sweetness of her smile, 
Little angels seem to hover all around me, 
While the birds direct to me their joyous lay, 
And the fish within the streamlet play to please me, 
Since I 
met this little flower, Lilly May. 
CHORUS. 
More lovely than the blooming rose, 
The dew drop pearl within ; 
And constant as the stream that flows, 
A 
precious prize to win. 
There's a 
baud of angels singing in her laughter, 
And a 
cupid merry making in her eye ; 
With a 
shyness like the pearl I 
named her after, 
Recollection of her beauty brings a 
sigh ; 
But she said she always wished to see me happy, 
Would help to ease my days of care and strife, 
And a 
sweeter, dearer vow she lately made me, 
'Twas her willingness to share my future life. 
More lovely, Arr.

SLAVERY DAYS. 
Words by E. HARRIGAN. 
Music by DATE BILLHING 
Music published by Wm. A. POND, N. Y. 
I 
am thinking to-day of dem years dirt pass'd away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
En old Virginny State, it was dar we separate, 
And it fill'cl my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise ; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slaviry days. 
CHORDS. 
Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slasory days. 
Still my niem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [bark, 
At night, when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd! 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road; [ last, 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, I 
have reach'd de end at 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says ; 
But our nienfry will turn roun, when our souls day were 
tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. -

Let my people go;

GRANDFATHER'S CLOCK, 
Words and music by HENRY C. 
W ORK, 
The music of this song is published by C. 
M. 
CADY, 107 Duane 
Street, New York. 
Price 35 cents. 
My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf, 
So it stood ninety years on the floor; 
It was taller by half than the old man himself, 
Though it weighed not a 
pennyweight more. 
It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born, ) 
And was always his treasure and pride ; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, without slumbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
His life- seconds numbering, tick, tick, tick, tick, 
It stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
In watching its pendultm swing to and fro, 
Many hours had he spent while a 
boy ; 
And in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know, 
And to share both his grief and his joy, 
For it struck- twenty-four when he entered at the door 
With a 
blooming and beautiful bride; 
But it stopped short—never to go again— 
When the old man died. 
Ninety years, etc,

JUST FROM TENNESSEE, 
White folks we are just from Tennessee, 
We left our homes to have sonic recreation; 
Greatly delighted we will be, 
If we can only gain your approbation. 
We parted from the old folks with a 
sigh, 
And left them there a-crying on the station; 
But they'll miss us, ' deed they will, 
And the place will be so still, 
Because the boys have left the old plantation. 
When moon-light streamed across the cabin floor, 
'Twos then the old man sat the banjo ringing; 
The'darkies used to gather round the door, 
And mosso too would listen to our singing. 
But often now we sigh for our old home, 
For it is the happiest spot in all thelnation 
But we'll go there before we die, 
And now we are going to try 
To show the style down on the old plantation.

Far, far away. 
Dere's wha my heart is turning ebber, 
Der's wha de old folks stay. 
And up and down the whole creation,

Still longing for de old plantation, 
And for de old folks at home. 
All de world am sad and dreary, 
Ebry where I

Oh ! darkeys, how my heart grow. wearY. 
Far from de old folks at home. 
All round de little farm I 
wandered, 
When I 
was young; 
Den many happy days I 
squandered, 
Many de songs I 
sung. 
When I 
was playing wid my brudder, 
happy was I; 
Oh! take me to my kind old muckier, 
Dere let me live and die. 
All de world am sad and dreary, tte, 
One little lint among de bushes, 
One dat I

Still sadly to my memory rushes, 
No matter where I

All round de comb ? 
when will I

HAPPY AS " 4" FIGS, 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and Composed by BrnLy Sx-rrn, expressly for 
THE BIG " 4." 
On a 
little old plantation, 
Where the light I 
first did see ; 
Down on the Swannee River, 
In the State of Floridee ! 
Old Master, he was good and fat, 
And always used us right; 
And when we'd sing or dance for him, 
He'd scream out with delight! 
CHORUS. 
Oh my! We are as happy as four figs—[ Break] 
Oh my! We are as happy as four figs— 
We're Indian Rubber, Gutta Percha, 
Gum Elastic Nigs! 
We have danced for every Nation, 
From the Dutch to the Chinee! 
We dance up hill and down again, 
And we danced upon the Sea; 
We know some little Yaller Girls, 
And them we're going to try 
To dance into their affections, 
Or we'll dance until we die 
Chorus as before. 
TWO ORPHANS. 
Composed and sung by P. J. 
DOWNEY. 
Air.—" Over the hills to the Poor-House." 
The evening's bright stars they were shining, 
The moonbeams shone clear on our land, 
Our city was in peace and quietness, 
The hour of midnight near at hand. 
But hark ! do you hear that cry ? 
Fire : 
How dismal those bells they do sound; 
Our Brooklyn Theatre is burning ! 
Alas, burning fast to the ground. 
CHORUS. 
We ne'er can forget the 
Two Orphans," 
Bad luck seems to be in its wake, 
It seems it were brought to our city. 
The lives of our dear friends to take? 
The doors they wae open at seven, 
The curtain was rolled up at eight ; 
Them that had got seats they w. re happy, 
Outside they were mad that were late. 
The play it went on very smoothly. 
Till sparks from the scenes they did tly 
Its then that men, women and children, 
"Oh, God, save our lives !" they did cry, 
ne'er can, 
 •••••alMillarg 
etc. 
Next morn in amongst those black ruins, 
Oh, God ! what a 
sight met our eyes 
The dead they were lying in all shapes, 
Sonic there that none could recognize. 
Poor mothers there weeping and crying, 
For sons that were out all that night; 
Oh, God let their souls rest in heaven, 
Amongst the innocent and bright. 
We ne'er can, etc.) 
What means this large gathering of people, 
Upon such a 
cold dreary day? 
Or what means this long line of hearses, 
With tops plumed in feathery array. 
Far out to the cemetery of Greenwood, 
Where the wind makes the lone willow sigh, 
'Tis there where the funeral is going, 
The poor unknown dead there to lie. 
We ne'er can. etc."

Written by W, II. DELELIANTY. 
Performed by DELEHANTY &

I'm as happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude. 
For love it is the burden of my song., 
With joy I'm almost crazy ; 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude, 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dear, don't you wish that you was me, (

I

big bumble-bee, (s/m.) 
I 
was walking by her door, 
When I 
heard the music sweet, 
And my heart with joy filled over, 
T 
couldn't keep my feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
For it makes me feel so good; 
And if, perchance, I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I

don't intrude.

At a

Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We felt so awful good. 
Oh. Daisy looked so fair and bright, 
She set the men all crazy; 
And if they asked her tor to dance. 
She'd ask me it she could. 
And then I'd say in a 
careless way— 
I 
hope I

An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called liceners DUAIPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportu. 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary al:). 
pearance of a 
child's pi4ure book, gaily printed and colored, it is ffe 
bound that a 
practised itanipulator taking it up and flirting the leavee 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit • the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."— Phil. Eve. Bull

George Barnwell, THE M EECIIANT'S CLERL — This is an 
extremely sensational sketch, but shows Truth stranger than Fiction. 
This deluded victim went from crime to crime with a 
fearful rapidity, 
urged by the baneful influences of women lost to honor. 
He realized 
every moment the evils of his course, but, like a 
bird fluttering over the 
basilisk eye of the serpent, he went down, down, into the vortex of ruin 
and despair. 
This book teaches, in the strongest way, the moral lesson 
of resisting that temptation, which comes arrayed like an " angel of
