0:03     Announcement, initial question–when and where born, how you got into ironworkers
trade?
0:50     I was born in Vernon County, Wisconsin, at Kicakpoo Center in February 14, 1940.   We
lived on a farm.  My grandfather had 440 acres at Kickapoo Center and we were basically, my
father was working with my grandfather.
1:28    [Anyone you knew in ironworker’s trade?]  Not really.  Of course, you’re a young kid and
everything is new to you.  But because of WWII, my parents decided to move to Madison,
Wisconsin and work in the war industry.  My mother went to work at Oscar Mayer’s and my
father also worked there in the beef kill for many years.  Eventually he retired from there.  But it
was my good fortune to grow up in Madison, attend school here.  Needless to say I ran into and
encountered more tradesmen in my young life.  I attended Madison East in 1953 until 55, at
which time, I had no choice.  I had to go to Monona Grove High School, it was a brand new high
school then on the east side.  Got involved with the shop classes.  I had a couple of good
instructors, although I’ll back up a minute.  I also had some excellent shop instructors at Madison
East.  And so I enjoyed working with my hands.  And then my father was also a carpenter.  So I
got a lot of hands-on training from my father.  I decided early that I liked working with my hands
but not necessarily as a carpenter.  Too much vegetation or vegetable matter to work with.  But I
did like working around iron and different metals.  So back in the 50s or early 60s, it was pretty
common for guys who didn’t want to go on the college track, that we could go down on Park
Street, er, it was Butler Street then where the old labor hall was.  You could walk in that door
and literally go from office to office and speak with the business managers and the BA’s [business
agents] and find out what the employment picture was.  Back then I was too old to come in as an
apprentice because they had an age limitation back then and the only way you could get in is if
you were coming out of the military and then they would waive that.  Otherwise you had to be
18-19 to get an apprenticeship.  But they had a system that was called “permit workers,” and if
you were lucky enough to get on, you could work on a permit until you kind of proved yourself. 
Then they would approach you about joining the local.  That’s how I got started.  I started out on
mostly bridge work, highway work.  Long hot days.  Hard work physically, but I did like it.  And
I liked the guys I got to know and work with.
5:13  [Give me your parents’ names.]  My father’s was Herbert Newton Smith and my mother’s
maiden name was Opal Pearl Hoke.  [I take it you lived on the East Side?]  Yeah, we lived in
Monona Village, at that time, before it was a city.  Lived at 205 Nicholas Road.  [Some suggest
that the East Side is an old working class part of town…?]  Oh very much so, yes.  Absolutely. 
[Could you elaborate…about what your neighbors had done or what the…?]  Very little industrial
base on the West Side of Madison.  It was almost entirely on the East Side.  Some of it is still
there.  Most of it is gone, unfortunately.  By far and away…  I always referred the fields of the
East Side was middle class working people.  All the 8 to 4:30 people.  We used to have the
Capital Times paper which was the evening paper.  And most working people got the evening
paper because they didn’t have time in the morning to read the paper.  They got the fresh news in
late afternoon.  Pretty much our daily ritual was my father sitting down and reading the Cap
Times.  Then discussing things [laughs].  It was usually one-sided…  [chuckles].  Just a
remembrance. 
7:20  [You mentioned Oscar Mayer’s.  What were some of the places where people worked in?] 
You had Madison Brass, the printing outfit out there.  You’re making me stretch here a little bit. 
Oh, Ray-o-Vac Batteries was at Union Corners.  That employed a lot of people.  Gisholt Foundry
was alive and well and busy.  That started out with a guy by the name of Johnson and he basically
was in farm equipment when they first got going.  Then it evolved in Gisholt’s.  We used to call it
the Norwegian poorhouse.  LAUGHTER   [I have a friend, George Gilbertsen, who lives on
Waubesa Street, who is on the Ramblers…]  You’re kidding.  No, we talked…yeah….yeah… 
[So he lived right up against the rest of those…one of those foundries…]  I think I know what
one.  LAUGHTER  The one that they claim pollutes.  [So  what year did you start there as an
ironworker?]  I came in during the early 60s on a work permit for a couple of years.  Then a
business manager approached me on the job site and at that time, you needed two journeymen to
sign and vouch for you, which they did.  Wesley Roscoe and Swede…Swenson.  John
Swenson…his brother…  Boyd Swenson was a superintendent ironworker for Findorff
Construction then and he was the other guy who signed for me.  [So what outfit were you
working with on permit?]  Well, they kicked you around a lot when you’re working out of a
mixed local.  By far and away, most of our members worked for various contractors.  I had one
year that I literally worked for 30 some contractors.  When I had my taxes done, the CPA looked
at me and says, “Jesus, son, can’t you keep a job?”  He had no understanding about how our
system worked.  I really liked it because I got so much diversification in the work that I was
doing.  Of course, when I came in I was just a little dumber than a stump.  Over a period of time,
and thank God for the old guys, they kicked you in the butt and point you in the right direction. 
So I did not…was never formally trained as an apprentice, although I did pick up a set of training
manuals.  I still have them today.  Much smaller than the new ones.  But anyway, basically on the
job training.  I always enjoyed going to work.  That’s one thing I have never felt bad about…or
wanted to take the day off.  Between the guys, the type of work, and learning…just the whole
experience.  Working outside.  Perfect view every day at the office. 
11:08  [Tell me about some of the old guys that you learned from.]  Herb Tiedeman.  Syd Erstad,
the foreman for Kupfer Ironworks.  I think I worked for every one of the old foremen at Kupfer. 
They just put you where they needed you.  Crews were always intermingling and changing man
power from day to day.  You never knew where they were going to send you.  You’d go to the
yard in the morning and the field superintendent would come in and say, “You, you, and you,
you’re going there.”  And so on and so forth.  So it’s a must to bring all your tools, finishing
tools, rod tools, welding tools, structural tools.  That was your kit and you needed it almost daily. 
[So when you were learning sort of the ‘school of the hard knocks’, what was your technique or
how did…  Did you just watch people, did people yell at you sometimes or show you things?]  Oh
yeah.  I’ve been referred to by many derogatory terms when I was young.  But at the end of the
day, you knew they liked you.  They were going to take care of you.  It was just their way of
expressing their feelings at the time.  You’ve got to remember that some of these guys never
finished high school.  They came up the old way.  Hard work and you learn as you go.  Someone
taught them.  You have to remember that even if you do away with a formal apprentice, the
apprenticeship will survive because it’s the oldest job learning technique in our history.  It goes
back to Biblical times.  If you’re a girl, your mother is the one that taught you how to cook. 
Your dad taught you how to change a tire on a car.  That’s an apprenticeship.  It’s learning.  It’s
an experience.  [Do you remember any derogatory terms that were directed to you?]  Well, let’s
see.  You’re a waste of skin.  That was pretty common.  They didn’t like long hair.  That was kind
of a no-no back then because you were either a hippie or a subversive, one of the two. 
[Chuckles.]  Some of the young guys used to get haircuts “voluntarily.”  [Not Nick Rochon.] 
LAUGHTER   Nick Rochon.  Where do you know Nick Rochon?  [I’ve got pictures of him from
a story that Dave Nelson…]  Tinker?  [Yeah.]  Tinker…his shop is just over this hill here.  You
can just about throw a rock and hit that.  He was one of the classics.  He got his hair cut at the… 
Well, we were building the Dane County Coliseum.  I remember it quite well.  [laughs]  [Can you
describe what happened?]  [Laughs]  Well, they just cut his hair.  Well, they shortened.  Let me
put it that way.  And Nick wasn’t terribly happy about it as I recall.  But yeah-he went home
lighter that night.  [Laughs]  [So they might have grabbed him a couple of times…]  GIGGLE  
Well, they might have, yeah. 
15:14  [You mentioned having to go to the job with all these different tools…  How did you come
by your tools?]  Well again, if you keep your mouth shut and your eyes and ears open, it’ll take
you a long way.  You can’t be afraid to ask questions when something important, or you feel its
important comes.  So when you start out…and you go…  “Where did you get that stud wrench? 
Where do I go to get me one of those…?  How much are they?”   The old guys would tell you,
“Well, you can get them here, here and here.  And they’ll cost about…”  Ornamental tools? 
You’re not going to find too many ironworkers that don’t love hardware stores and Farm and
Fleet stores and any stores that carry multiple use tools.  You watch and of course
experience…and some of the old guys…  The good ones will show you how to correctly use an
adjustable wrench, for instance.  Any tool…the air tools, the impacts [impact wrenches] and
everything.  They will show you the way.  Then they’ll kind of kick you in the butt every once in a
while if you’re doing it wrong.  And so basically that’s the way we learn.  [Did anyone ever make
or modify or…] Oh, strictly, certainly. Because everyone’s hands are different size, different
length.  Maybe you’ve got long fingers and small palms, vice versa.  So you’re going to have to
adapt the tools to your liking.  Like a sleever bar, you can go out there and structural guys… 
You can run up to 10, 12 structural guys and you’ll notice their sleever bars all have a little tweak
or tick to them.  They’re not all identical.  And of course, you know, small guys are going to be a
little different than the big guys.  So on and so forth.  That was the other nice thing about the
trades.  Everybody isn’t 220 pounds and 6 foot four and 20 years old.  You have to adapt with
different size guys, different weights, different…so on and so forth.  And when you’re working
with stuff and you’re in a pinch.  You gotta holler out and get some help.  If it’s too heavy, too
long, too short, whatever.  That’s all part of a team. [So with your tools, are there some that
you’ve modified or customized in particular?]  PAUSE  You can take a 12 inch adjustable
wrench, for instance…commonly referred to as a crescent wrench.  You can literally run the
screw back off it and get the travel to go longer.  It will open…the jaws will go wider so you can
make an adjustment on that wrench…when you encounter different sized nuts and bolts and
things that you find you need to do that.  Your rod wrench, for instance, your hand…  You’re
going to heat up the lower handle and put a bend in it.  There again, one guy’s bend is more than
the next guy’s.  So on and so forth.  You work it until you fit your hand, not theirs.  Well…why
you kind of got me here.  I’m not thinking too good.  [That’s okay.]  I’m not an interviewer. 
[Have you ever put your name or initial anywhere…?]  Oh sure, you’re going to either mark it
with slash marks, paint isn’t permanent so you won’t see much of that.  Carpenters, they’re more
into painting or something like that to mark their tools.  Most of ironworkers’ tools are either
notched with a grinder or else you weld your initials or first name or something on your wrenches
or that, especially if you’re on a powerhouse job or real large project where you have many, many
ironworkers because, yes, if you look at a spud wrench, it’s a spud wrench.  It’s pretty similar. 
And so on and so forth. 
20:12  [Do guys ever…prank with someone?]  Glad you asked that.  We were working up to
Manley Sand and Gravel many years ago and Ray Spangler--as I remember right, Ray was single
but he had nieces and nephews.  Ray had a tendency--he always packed his lunch.  He took a lot
of grief.  He had been to the old Treasure Island Store which is long gone now…  Treasure Island
used to set where American TV is now on the beltline if I recall.  They had run a real special on
Easter candy--all the hard candy on the outside and soft stuff in the--eggs, candy eggs.  Ray had
bought just a ferocious amount of bags of this candy for his nieces and nephews.  He would drive
the car up to Manley Sand and Gravel and park.  We’d go to work and John Schuepbach, he had
a pretty playful way about him.  Unbeknownst to him, he would periodically come out and ask
Ray if he could borrow his car to run into Portage for something.  Maybe 2-3 miles outside of
Portage was where Manley Sand and Gravel was.  We went up there and bolting up and…  We
were bolting up the structural, as we go from point-to-point, we kept finding these stupid Easter
eggs.  [laughter]  They would be anywhere--under the beam, behind a flange, it was just crazy.  At
first we started eating some.  They were pretty good.  Who doesn’t like sugar?  Ray just couldn’t
get over that.  None of us could.  At the end of the day, Ray had to go home and he discovered
that his Easter egg candies were gone.  Ray didn’t finally catch on to…who was using my car? 
Ahh, well, he got to locking his car after that, [laughs] especially when he discovered that his
Easter eggs were gone.  [Laughs.]   That was a humorous situation. 
23:05 [Can you think of any more?]  We were down in Monroe, Wisconsin…  I can’t remember
what we were working on but we were starting a structural job.  Donny Hein was the crane
operator.  I think his brother, Jim, was pushing…  I can’t remember for sure but I think his
brother was pushing the job.  Kenny Zespi [sp?], he was an old timer and he was from Cross
Plains, Wisconsin.  He was always buying old rattle traps to get to work and back.  He bought
either a Plymouth or a Dodge.  On their way down to Monroe to the job site, a gas tank strap
broke and the gas tank was kind of hanging anti-gogglin’ [??] there.  Rubbing on the road so that
would be a no go.  So when he got to the job site, because they weren’t that far I guess to go, as I
recall.  They decided that they would re-weld the gas strap.  So they had Jimmy Hein… We put
slings as sprutters on the back of Zespi’s car.  And they raised it up.  They could be welding and
they could tip a little to make sure the gas was down at one end.  That was in the days before they
figured out that it’s the fumes that explode, not the liquid.  But…anyway…  They were welding
that strap back together and they blew a hole in the gas tank with a torch.  Now the gas is on fire. 
And Donny Hein—he and his old live boom crane—he picked the car up right away and he
started going around in a circle.  The only problem was--the gas that was spilling on the ground
caught fire so there was a ring of fire.  He was just keeping that car ahead of that ring of fire.  It
was quite something to behold.  Let me tell you.  LAUGHTER 
23:36   [A minute ago, you talked about a particular part of a bar… Was it a slaver or…]  Sleever
bar.  It’s actually a truck iron but… HE GOES AND GETS IT   If you work structural, this way
you have more lever than a 12 inch spud wrench--when you’ve got to pry, when you hold stuff
on.  So one end is for holding up on structural steel, the other is when you have pinch points, you
can--one man can move some huge iron around with this sleever bar.  Now this is… [Like a giant
spud wrench…]  Yeah, but here you can lift things, you can pry things apart or…so on and so
forth.  Now the average ironworker will alter this.  They may heat it down here and put a bend in
it so they have a rocker seat for the pry.  But we always put…weld a large washer on here…and
then we adapt it to our belt, our structural belt [i.e. the tool belt worn during structural steel
work] so you can wear it on your side.  Slip it in and it’ll stay.  It will be in like a holster.  You
need your hands when you’re kicking around.  [You don’t want to trip over it…]  No, no, no.  It
goes in your belt, about like this.  You just pull it out of the shealt.  I do not have—my old one I
donated to the apprentices.  Most of my tools…most of them have been donated.  These are
probably… various shapes and forms.  Here’s an octagon one and…  It’s the same way.  This is
the ones that will glide and adapt to their own personal length.  [Cool.]  I would assume that, you
go over by the hall [Labor Temple], you could probably get someone to show you how they
adapted theirs.  When you’re up there with 5-6 ton beams, it’s a little hard to move them around
with a little spud wrench. That’s just for holding up and bolting up.
28:50  [In your trade, with a mixed local, were there some kind of jobs that you liked better than
others?  Oh, certainly.  It’s like…  Anyone who has a job that’s multifaceted, you’re going to just
gravitate toward things that interest you and you enjoy performing.  So absolutely.  And without
further adieu, you’re going to get better at that.  You’re going to get more proficient.  Pretty
soon, it’s word of mouth.  You work for different contractors.  They’re in business, they’re in
business to make money.  That’s what it’s all about.  So they’re going to try their best to surround
themselves with journeymen that they like and good crew members, but also…  No matter what
task they are assigned, they know they’re competent at it.  They know they will do the
job…which in turn turns into money.  [Laughs]  [Did you learn welding, connecting, rod
busting…?]  I did a lot of rods when I first started out because probably that is…from my point of
view…probably the least popular part of the trade.  It’s bull work.  It’s hard.  Hard physically.  I
did a lot of it.  I always enjoyed the guys I worked with.  You’re always partnered up on rods and
stuff like that.  You’re always working with at least one or two other guys.  You realize that after
your first structural job that, hey, this is a little bit easier.  There’s—a hard day, you’re still getting
short rests in between.  When you’re waiting for the next piece iron to come up, there’s a short
period that you’re waiting.  Anticipating.  Nice part of structural is that it’s too heavy to do by
hand.  Rods…rods are different.  You move that, carry it, place it.  Structural is different in that
area.  Of course you’re off the ground now so the rules change.  You’ve got to know where
you’re at.  You’ve got to stay at ease.  You certainly get around the iron much better if you’re
comfortable.  If you’re butt cheeks are all tightened up because you’re afraid of falling, it’s not a
good situation.  And if you keep at it, yeah, you acclimate and you get pretty confident.  You
always know where your feet are.  The edge…you don’t even look.  You know.  You can feel it. 
Most guys are…  You get your boots worn in, you can feel the flanges through your shoes.  You
know where you’re at.  And you still perform your work.  It’s the old story.  It’s easy climbing up
there.  It’s doing the work after you get there is the hard part.  And it’s pretty crude. 
32:30   Iron…  You get in there in a quarter of an inch on the level, that’s pretty tight stuff with
that.  Structural, where you go over to metal, and now you’re dealing with 64ths, 32nds…  That’s
finite work.  Most of it is anodized so you can’t be scratching and scrubbing stuff.  It’s real
picky-picky stuff but a lot of fun to work with.  When done correctly, it looks really nice when it’s
done. 
33:07  Welding.  Welding really runs the gambit.  There’s just…  You’re always referred to rough
welding.  You’re welding down a bar joist on a job.  You can get a little sloppy and nobody’s
going to get hurt.  Everything’s cool.  If you’re welding moment connections [see definition
on-line] on a building, you’ve got to be a state licensed welder in order to be able to do that or
supposedly licensed to do that type of work—because those are the fail points on a building. 
Many are magnifluxed or they’re x-rayed after you get done.  Sometimes they’ll issue you a
welding stamp so that when you’re done with your moment connection, you stamp your initials in
it so there’s a record on the job of who welded it, how they welded it, under what conditions. 
You’ve got to slow them down, make sure you slag it and clean it out.  Jitter bug it, whatever it
takes.  Then you go over and other parts of welding are--some of them are very ornate and
ornamental.  They are going to be exposed to the public, especially on an entry of a building,
foyer in a building, something where it’s right out in front of you there.  So you’re going to use a
different technique and different type of electrode or process or to weld that.  They’ll accept
some…some are unacceptable so they have to be worked on again. 
35:05   Every facet of the trade…  When you get into it, there’s a tremendous amount of stuff to
learn and salt it away.  And again hands-on experience without a doubt the most important part of
the job.  [You used a couple of terms with the welding.  One was to “slag in and jitter bug a
beam.”  Tell me what that means.]  Well, if you’re using a gas shielded process where there is no
slag, you’re in good shape.  It’s called a mig.  That’s great.  But I’d say, even yet today, 90% of
the welding that the ironworker performs in the field is done with the old fashioned electrode in a
stinger.  They are 11 inches long and the electrodes are coated with what I call a cake mix but it’s
a combination of chemicals that cover the electrode.  They’re all part of the process for that
specific electrode.  They are all numbered and all different sizes.  So for instance, if you wanted a
certain technique and you need 60-11 electrode.  Another process, another type of welding done,
you might want 70-18, low hydrogen electrode for.  But anyway, in the process, while this thing
is melting and you’re fusing the metal together, the chemical combination on the exterior of the
electrode becomes slag…  It burns up and its there to shield the molten metal from that electrode
from the atmosphere.  The atmosphere has a tremendous amount of contaminants in it.  An open
weld that’s unshielded, you’ll get all kinds of junk in there.  You’ll get pit holes and so on and so
forth.  So when you’re done, obviously this is raw metal.  Somewhere along the process, this is
going to have to be painted.  Many years ago, we used red lead paint, which is “really good” for
you.  [Laughs]  But anyway, slagging is just taking a chip hammer or hammer and chisel or
whatever and getting into that weld and knocking that slag off the weld to expose it.  You wire
brush it.  Clean it up.  And along come the painters, later on, and will apply some type of finish
coat of something.  On the welding.   [And the jitter bug?]  Jitter bug is an air-driven rattle…  It’s
like a chisel.  It’s got a chisel blank in front of it.  It’s a vibrator for air pressure so you can go
along.  It’s like a miniature jack hammer.  [Cool.] 
38:40  [You’ve mentioned contaminants in the air so then maybe it’s a good time to ask about… 
Weather.  What are your experiences as an ironworker.  You said you’re office is outdoors
but…some of the…  What can you say about that?]  Well, I think most ironworkers will agree
with me that only in Wisconsin…working iron…there are only 2-3 days that are perfect.  The rest
of the time it’s way too damn hot or its way too damn cold.  But if you have a wife, and kids and
a mortgage, you’ll find a special impetus in you to go to work every day.  I’ve worked at -5
outside.  Not too bad.  Not pleasant but not that bad.  The next day, the wind is blowing 15 miles
an hour and its 10 above zero and you can’t make it.  It’s exposure so you’ve got to call it a day. 
If you want to be an ironworker, you better get comfortable when the weather swings or
otherwise you’re going to starve to death.  So you dress accordingly.  Grouch and moan and
things like that, complain, but you get through it just like the rest of the guys.  That’s called
making a living.
40:13   [What about accidents?  Have you had some or did you call in any?]  I don’t think you’re
going to find too many ironworkers that haven’t been or received an injury on the job. 
Unfortunately I’ve fallen a couple of times and as you interview some of the old guys, you’re
going to find that a few of those guys have fallen too.  In my case, I got very fortunate.  I was
lucky both times that I fell.  I had pretty decent landings.  I’ve never broken a bone but I sure got
scared the hell out of me a few times.  [Did you fall on to a deck or something like that?]  Well,
once I fell into a pile of wash sand that the masons had and it just happened to be in the right
specific spot on that job site.  It cushioned my fall.  It was still pretty solid.  I knew I hit
something.  After the wind was knocked out of me I was ok.  Another time up in Weyawauga’s
old folks home, I lost a ladder.  Just a stupid, stupid thing.  I lost a ladder and down I went.  And
again, it was more embarrassing than it hurt. 
 41:40  [Did you climb columns]  Yeah, before OSHA started, it was established in 1974.  That
date sticks in my mind.  I might be off a year or two but I know it was right in there.  Prior to
OSHA, it was very common for us to ride the ball down for lunch and you’d ride the ball up after
lunch.  And you’d have 3, 4, 5 guys…and you’d interlock arms and hold on to each other and a
load line.  One foot was on the ball and the other foot was in the air, wrapped around another
guy’s leg.  You’d ride the ball up, you’d ride the ball down.  And if the crane wasn’t there, many
times you’d have 40 pounds of bolt, plus your tools…  Yeah, you’d literally climb 1-2 stories up
to the job site.  Sometimes more…  For the most part, one or two stories usually did it.  [Did it
take a while to get the hang of that?]  Well, most ironworkers make a specific type of sole on
their shoe.  I happen to have a pair of soles right now.  They’re made of… It’s hard, its solid.  It’s
wedged.  You got your whole foot on a wedged sole.  But they had the right compound that
would bite into iron.  If you place your weight on the soul, then you’d find that it would grip the
iron.  If your soles are too hard, they won’t bite—they just skid off the steel.  So again, as you
interview or meet ironworkers or watch them in the field.  They used to wear high tops, red
wings.  Red wings, very popular with ironworkers.  I’m sure a couple of…  I’m sure the Shoe
Box in Black Earth will attest to that.  They sell many of them.  The nice part about them, all you
had to do is call them up and they’d…  Steve Schmidt…yeah…they’ll be in the mail.  Send me a
check when you get them.  [That’s pretty good.]  Yeah, they’re $100 boots.  If you order a
couple of pair, but Steve is very well liked and very respected because you didn’t have to drive to
Black Earth.  Just give him a call and boom, two days later, you’d have ‘em.  [I worked with
some ironworkers at the Smithsonian and I tried climbing columns with sneakers on I tried
climbing…I couldn’t.]  And then you saw how they were doing it.  [Well, yeah.  It’s like…Just
like cat.]  Well, if you swing your butt…  If you watched them, all that weight is going on the sole
in the web.  So there’s your bite.  So as you swing, up you go.  Swing up and go…  And after a
while, you get where most people don’t even see that accent.  But yeah, it’s all in the gripe, if you
bite.  That’s why if you have pocks in the iron, you can’t.  But if you’ve got just red leaded iron
or raw iron, good bite.  And then it’s just upper body strength.  You’re pulling a load, especially if
you’ve put about 60 pounds of tools on.  LAUGHTER
45:55   [Tool belt is important.]  Oh yeah.  [Do people make them or modify them at all?]  Oh
yeah.  There’s a lot of belts…  HE GETS ONE   Here’s the only one I got left around here.  I
gave all my…  This is the old side lanyard.  This is what they call a bridge belt.  You got your
tools down and you’re above a ladder.  If you fall or that, all you have to do…it’s like a parachute
lanyard.  Just pull on that…  These are made by Klein.  As you can see, the mechanism opens
right up.  So you loose, otherwise, you’d drown for sure.  And again, this  affectionately became
known as a bridge belt bridge and it’s out.  And there’s no buckle.  HE DEMONSTRATES   And
here’s the adjustable.  And before OSHA, this is where our 6 foot lanyard would go through the
belt.  They’re all make, model and serial number, each one is an  individual belt.  That’s the story
and then there’s just a couple bolt bags on there now.  Like I said, you’ll have to go to the hall if
you want to photograph tools.  I’m sure they’d be more than happy for you to come in there.
47:50   [Speaking of bridges, did you ever work on a rivet gang or…one of those?]  I only
worked on one rivet.  They were pretty much out of the business by the time I come in.  We went
down to Rockford, Illinois, to do a small job at their plant.  Since it was Rockford Bolt Company. 
The old guy that owned it, he had thousands of rivets that were never sold.  So he decided that he
would use some of those rivets.  That was the only rivet job I ever worked on..  That’s before I
became a blacksmith when I learned my heats.  There’s a heat chart there on the…  They are
heated to a certain color.  I can’t even remember.  We had an old guy from Janesville that was the
heater.  He was heating and throwing.  Boy, it’s been so long ago I can’t remember.  [So that
went over the trade at…?]  Oh yeah.  I want to say that the railroads…were still riveting at the
end of the 60s.  I’m fairly sure that most railroad bridges were still being riveted.  Then one guy
would have the rivet gun…  They used tongs to put the rivet in the hole…air operated pneumatic
rivet gun.  You’d come up on the head.  The other guy on the other side would have what they
called a horse cock.  He would back her…just pull the trigger and run and you might roll the gun
so you get a nice round head.  That’s all I can…  I was the only one…  I took a lot of rivets
out…  [laughs]
50:20  [When I saw you up on the square, we talked very briefly about Max and Kenny…]  Elliot
Funmaker.  He was an ironworker too.  He just got into… I just heard abut him on the news. 
Something about Elliot…  Ho-Chunk Board or something like that.  I believe Kenny is his dad. 
[I’m going to have to talk to him because he said a lot of his brothers are singers.]  Yeah, they are
performers in…  [I’m going to work with him in mid-August at a festival in Dodgeville.]  Great,
great.   [What can you tell me about…  I think you said his dad was real quiet and Kenny…]  
Max was very quiet.  Maybe two words a day, that would be a conversation.  Kenny, you could
get around and talk to Kenny quite a bit as I recall.  [So did you work on some jobs with those
guys?]  Oh…  The only thing I can remember…  He worked on the McGregor, Iowa, rehab on
the bridge down there, the box girder bridge, for American Bridge.  If memory serves, I believe
one of his duties was sharpening drills and he was pretty good at that.  The only other one was we
were doing a grocery store on the north side of Madison (USED TO BE EAGLES, THEN
KOHLS NOW JUNGS).  That was a structural job.  Those are the only two times that I… 
Ladish Malt, on the make over down there…  He wasn’t in the same crew that I was in… 
52:45  [Let me ask about the rivalries with the other trades.  What is the ironworkers sense of
themselves in relation to the other trades and are there rivalries?]  Well most of the tradesmen I
know…and it’s done in a friendly way…  We kid with other trades.  That’s why we call
electricians “sparkies” and stuff like that.  Brickies…  But it’s usually the person.  Once you
humanize a person, no matter what they do.  I feel as though once you humanize someone, you
have a much better relationship with them.  You start doing things out of spite, that doesn’t get
you anywhere.  Maybe short term but not long term.  The one thing, I think historically, is that
carpenters seem to think…  As the saying goes, “There ain’t a trade out there that a carpenter
doesn’t like.”  Ok?  To put it in a friendly way.  They’ll encroach on your purview of work. 
Damn it – we have families to support and feed too.  If we don’t have work, that’s pretty hard to
do.  Yeah, you get a little sharp with them when you find out that they’ve…  It’s like…  A
carpenter…  There ain’t one of ‘em that doesn’t have a wood puddler for concrete in their
toolbox.  So what does that tell you if you’re a cement finisher?  I guess…that’s about all I want
to say about that I think.
54:53   [You mentioned working for other locals…  Have you boomed out much?]  Well, during
times of strikes.  I was on the CAT plant, Caterpillar Plant, in Peoria during a strike.  Some of us
went over to Battle Creek Michigan on a nuclear plant during another strike.  Worked in
McHenry Illinois out of Local 498, which is Rockford.  But most of the guys were from Local 1
out of Chicago.  I worked down there on a hospital job with them.  I worked out by O’Hare field
a few times through Local 63.  I got to know, like I say, some of the officials and that of Local
63.  That certainly served me well.  512, Twin Cities because they border our local.  Local 8 is
Milwaukee.  Local 90…Local 89, Davenport, Iowa, er no, Cedar Rapids.  Anytime you get over
by the river, most of those locals are going to be a little injection of both locals.  And you get to
know them.  They live across the river there… [laughs]. You get places where you might get a
job on the river that LaCrosse guys are all busy, all working.  You need some men.  You’re sitting
in Madison…  Do I want to drive 100 miles…?  Nobody wants to fill the spot.  The business
manager may call Cedar Rapids.  Talk to the business manager.  “I hear you have guys out of
work, on the bench., we’ve got a job over…”  So that’s very common, very common.
57:00  [Some say ironworkers have a reputation that they like to drink?]  Oh, I don’t know…I
don’t know.  Ya know…  Personally, I don’t think we’re better at it or worse at it than some of
the other trades.  Painters like to drink.  LAUGHTER  I know that for a fact.  So yeah, you can
always point fingers but if guys like a beer, they like a beer.  Yeah…  It’s the nectar of the gods… 
57:55   [What about topping out or anything when you finished a job…  Can you talk about
ceremonies or customs you might…]  Well, on larger projects…yeah.  Up on the paper mills up
north, they make a real…especially if it’s big. The business school, when they finished that at the
UW.  Oh my…  We were on GEF 1 uptown.  They had a little deal, you go in there.  But a lot of
times they’ll have a leave-out beam or whatever that they’ll set to top it up.  Historically, it’s the
upper most member which doesn’t always happen because of the way things are constructed and
that.  But no matter how big the job or how small, there are usually…  If it’s just a whoop-de-do
and we’re done and whatever, that’s one thing.  But an American flag is pretty prevalent on the
job.  We usually keep a couple of banners at the hall that we can use at topping out ceremonies. 
[What’s on the banners?]  Just our local and ironworkers and that for the most part.  But the
other thing is, a lot of times we’ll sign the beam while we’re putting it in…  Or the uppermost
structural unit, pass it around.  Operators, everybody gets on that.  It’s an old…  I think the
Druids are part of that or maybe the Norwegians…for many different reasons.
59:36   [I noticed that you have a miniature crane…]  Yeah, well, that’s what happens when you
get old and you have all that time…  You start dabbling.  Ever since I came into the trade, I’ve
been fascinated with lattice boom cranes.  Unfortunately, they’re beginning to be a thing of the
past but, yeah…  You listen to the old timers talk about different makes and machines and things
like that.  If you look out…if you work with them…it’s pretty hard not get to like cranes because
they’re doing all the heavy stuff.  And then again, I always look at how things were designed,
structurally and engineering-wise, on the work.  So, yeah.  I dabble with that.  I have one down
here.  HE GETS IT    CAN’T HEAR WHAT’S BEING SAID, IN ANOTHER ROOM IN THE
GARAGE    MENTIONS THE “OLD MAN” AND THE “WHIP LINE”
01:02:30  Anyway, its just a little pastime or hobby of mine.  I have a wood one up there that I
did out of plastic.  I got to crawler up there yet.  [That’s cool.]  People get a kick out of them.
01:02:50 [Do guys make miniatures of equipment or do you ever set up a mini…?]  I don’t know
of any other guy in the local that does that.  I’m not saying there aren’t any.  I just…  Like I say,
when you get older and you have more time on your hands, you can devote time to doing
whatever you like.  We used to have…  Bill Maben…  Oh no…  But that guy was a fantastic
wood carver.  It would blow your mind to see what that man could do with a piece of wood.  And
I want to say his name was Grey.  He was an operator.  Pappy Brown from Pardeeville.  He was a
rigger.  He was a rigger’s rigger.  Unbelievable what he could do with those rope lines and stuff,
hooking stuff up.  And these are the guys you learn from.  If you take the time… 
01:03:52  [So rigging would be like setting up…?]  Yeah, fixing lines.  Well, you’re going to pick
some.  Every job ain’t the same.  You’ll find the ironworkers, like Reynold’s Crane Service. 
They’re moving.  And industrial moving.  Those ironworkers are there all the time – full time. 
And they’re just really gifted at rigging.  But that’s a whole…that’s a whole different part of our
occupation too.  It is all parts and that’s just one.  Crane man…  [Some of that has to carry over
on working on sailing ships.]  Yup, ships, sailing ships.  Yes, many ironworkers came from… 
Because they had two things going.  They could rig and they could get around tight.  Take some
of those old masted and schooners boy, you’re up off the ground.  [And you’re moving.]  And
you’re moving and you’ve got to be constantly changing lines.  I mean…  They’re in salt water. 
They’re taking a beaten.  They couldn’t have had a long life to ‘em.  So they’re continually…
Well, in the navy.  Chief Bosun Mate.  It’s amazing what those guys… A couple of them out in
Truax Field.  I don’t know if that’s a Seabee, flying or what’s out there flying.  I wanted to tie up
some boat bumpers.  Have you ever seen those?  [Oh, yes.  Millers they call them.]  Yeah.  Yeah. 
And those guys…  I didn’t know how to get started.  That was my problem.  I called out there…
“Guys come out…”  They made photocopies on the machine and everything.  They were great
guys.  [So do you still know a lot of knots and so forth?]  Oh yes.  If you’re at the hall in their
office, that knot board…  LAUGHS [You made that.]  Yeah.  [Oh cool.  My wife does a lot of
work with…]  Macrame.  […with commercial fishermen over the years.  Some with coast guard
people too.  She’s looked into all kinds of knot work that fishermen have done.  Folds or just
ties.]  There’s a book, I want to say it’s a UW book…  2001 knots.  [Yeah, I’ve seen that…]  It
takes you a little while.  Once you get into it and start it, it’s a lot easier. 
01:06:   [Some people do ‘em for tool handles, to just get a grip.]  Oh yeah, its all about the
application.  Absolutely.  A lot of times we’re putting something on the trailer and we have to
latch on that.  It all comes back. 
01:07:20  [So at what point did you move out of the field into the apprenticeship?]  We were just
part time coordinators early on.  And—WE TAKE A BREAK AND THEN COME BACK.]
01:07:40   The apprenticeship committee is made up of equal number of contractors and
journeyman.  Your usual response is, “What the hell do I know about being a coordinator…I’m
an ironworker.”  And they said, “Well, we’ve been observing you and all that…  We want you to
at least come in for an interview.”  So I went in.  It was only two days a week when I first started. 
I was working for Kupfer and I talked to the field superintendent, Rodney, and he said they’d
work around that.  I did that for probably two years or better.  I was doing both work and that. 
We lost our instructor – he quit.  And Scotty passed away from cancer.  He was the instructor for
many years, in the 60s…and 70s even. But then we had working with the tech school system in
the state.  They used to call it circuit instructors.  That’s where Madison handled all the
paperwork for their pay and benefits.  And the other tech school areas, you know, they signed an
agreement and they’d pay in but Madison would do the heavy lifting as far as the paperwork and
that.  And then that way you’d have a full load as an instructor.  You’d have to travel to the
students, thee students would not come to you.  You were on the road most every day of the
week.  And the load was always changing because of the areas.  You may teach in Chippewa Falls
or somewhere up there for a couple of years.  Then that would dry up but then they’d be adding
ironworkers in Janesville or whatever.  So I couldn’t find an instructor.  I got a couple but after
about two classes, they realized they were way in over their hands.  They were like, “what’s
prep?”  LAUGHS  And you know, these are four hour classes.  This isn’t like a half hour here and
you’re out of there…  And so…  They kept after me but finally, I said, “I can’t run the dang
thing, and still work.”  It’s just…  Well, just give it a try.  I don’t know… 2-3 months, I was in
Wausau, Wisconsin Rapids, Stevens Point, Madison and LaCrosse. Finally I said, it ain’t going to
happen.  So what if we up your hours and… Well, okay.  We’ll try that.  So eventually, I worked
4 days a week as a coordinator.  I could double up on some of the stuff because now I had
one-on-one contact with the apprentices as well as instructing.  I stayed instructing for 18 years. 
But if I had a couple of slack days or whatever, and there was a call in the hall…  They shipped
the stone in for the Kohl’s Center, the big W.  I worked for International Erectors a few times so
they requested me to weld that in place up there when they set it.  That was a better part of a day
so I was still on a regular basis but I was still working in the field.  [So you were one of the first
guys who became more or less full time apprenticeship?]   Yes, that was, I was the first full time. 
Eventually it was five.  As I got older and…LAUGHS  They just put me on. 
01:12:38   [What years did you do it for?]  December 1979 was when I came on board and I
retired in 2002.  [You mentioned a guy named Scottie.  What was his last name?]  Seth Scott was
the instructor back then.  Then Bert Bitters was full time, working as the next instructor. 
 
[This is probably enough…we’ve gone on for about an hour and a quarter…]
01:13:15  [I can play some back to you and maybe make some notes and pictures, especially of
these cranes and what you’re working on out here.]  Well, these…I volunteer.  I do a lot of
custom garden work too.  People over the years…  Now that I’m retired, as soon as your…  I’ve
been out here 42 years now.  And the farmers around here, their tractor, mold boards on their
plows and stuff, they know I’m a welder.  They’ve become very friendly.  [A “runaway” every
once in a awhile?]  LAUGHS  Yeah, well if you’re in rocks and stuff like that, it’s pretty easy to
bust up a mold board and a price of a mold board is…so…yeah…  I’ve done quite a bit of that. 
Or machinery breaks down.  I do that for them.  Pretty much on a free basis.  Good neighbor
policy.  And then about …the late 80s.  We started with the light show up at Warner Park on the
northside [of Madison].  I don’t know if you’re familiar with that or not.  [I’ve been there many
times.]  Those we tried to do 3 dimensional and put a lot of work into it.  We’d use apprentice
classes to be involved with that…which is good.  It’s a learning thing and…  Math problems to
work out.  So we made just about everything up there, 3 dimensional.  Then all of a sudden,
everyone got their butt up in a tail spin and they discontinued it.  Then next regime came in and
they were lukewarm about trying to get something started again.  The contractors were stepping
up and said, “Yeah, that was…  We got a lot of PR out of that.  It was good for our industry.” 
So…for about 2-3 years, they rented.  Out of  Upper New York, someplace where they made
these displays.  They were renters and the bill was in the 10s of $1,000s of dollars.  And why
don’t you guys…wait…  They’re not even yours.  You’re just renting them.  They’re done.  And
they decided…well…yeah… So they got rid of the rental but they bought two to keep.  Ever
since then…and then they approached me and they forgot…that I was involved with the old one. 
They talked to Freddie Brown, the electrician instructor…  And Fred said, “Yeah…through the
classes…Ed set these things up.  They’re great.  What the hell.  All we got to pay for is the
material.”  So the got ahold of me and talked me about the possibilities.  And I said, “Tell you
what.  You buy the material. Tell me what you want.  I’m retired, I have time.  I can make time. 
I’ll just make them up for you.  Just come and get them.”  And they were like, “Hey, great!  What
a deal.”  So the last 5-6 years, I’ve been… These are the last two…seven I’ve made this year.  I
did the Monona [Terrace] Frank Lloyd Wright building.  I did a castle.  I’ve got them on the clip
board up there.  I did a Snoopy bi-plane.  Similar in size, 20-25 feet.  So these will last too unless
they come up with another drawing.  You know.  I feel like I’m giving back something to the
community.  Am I helping feed the poop and starving?  No, they’ve got food banks.  What talent
do I have that I can…?  So that’s when I figured…  And my mother was in an assisted living
place before she passed away and I know that she looked forward…  Every winter they’d take a
bus and go see these displays.  All the elderly just loved it.  Little kids…  It’s not that I don’t care
about the regular people but…  They’re on their own.  But the old and the young, well, this is
something I can give back to them.  Good for me and good for them.  So it works really well. 
But…  I have people… 
1:18:43  Our mill race out there.  It just finished its drying.  I do a lot of…plant stands, garden… 
Anything that has to do with flowers and gardening.  I’m always looking for that.  Row markers,
tools, you name it. 
[Well, I think that’s great.  I’ve got some great stuff here.]
