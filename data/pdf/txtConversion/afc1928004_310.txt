Dis bran-new leedle fellow;

Upon de Hebrew harp.

OF you lisden to me I

ditty, 
Aboud de vorst voman dat efer I

Und von you hafe heard it you'll say datt 
Dot efer I

mother-in-law. 
Vatever I

Wherever I 
go vy she alvays is there, 
Und of I 
don't do eferyding dot she dells me, 
She quick helps herself to a 
lock of my hair. 
CHORUS. 
My life is all droubles, I 
cannot be happy, 
Of I 
open my mout she viii put in her jaw, 
I'd rather be sent oil to jail or to Congress, 
Than live all my life with my mother-in-law. 
Now she is so ugly she frightens the children, 
Venever she happens to valk on de street, 
For she's got a 
mond like a 
crack in a 
pumpkin, 
A hump on her back, und such very large feet, 
But she's got a 
notion dot she is good looking, 
Dough her- face is de vorst von dot efer I 
seen; 
Und von she sits down to have her pictures tocken, 
De very first glance she gives breaks de r.,.1chine. 
My life is all droubles, I 
cannot Le nappy, & c. 
I 
said to her vonce, " Ven I 
married your daughter, 
I 
did not intend de whole family to ved." 
Den she quickly caught hold of a 
bucket of vater, 
Und taking good aim let it go at my head. 
I 
hear dot dey done some good shooting at Creedmore, 
Dot ,le SHCiie vas so close it vas almost a 
draw; 
But I'll bet ten dollars dot nothing can equal 
Dot Iron-clad gunboat, my mother-:.->law. 
My life is all droubles, I 
cannot be happy, &c.

And called him her own leedle dear,

We started for the fair, 
With spirits light and hearty, 
Behind McCarthy's mare;

You never saw the likes of it, 
Believe me what I

"Honld her in!" McCarthy cried, 
"Stop her !" says McCue, 
I 
tho't I'd shake to pieces, 
As along the road we flew! 
Me head was swimming like a 
top. 
Me heart was in dispair; 
The divil himself was in the wheels 
Behind McCarthy's mare 
McCarthy held the reins, 
And Murphy held McCarthy, 
But whiskey filled their brains, 
And made them wild and hearty; 
Maloney tumbled out behind, 
And there we let him lay— 
Sure I 
offered to assist him— 
But the mare she ran away!

Oh! murthe- ! such a

With the mare that run away!

NOLAN AROUND THE CORNER. 
Written by BTJRT. W AYNE, for Philadelphia's favorite 
Irish Comedian, BILLY CARROLL. 
Aim—Hard to Love. 
There is a 
man around the corner, 
And Nolan is his name; 
He keeps a 
grog shop for the boys, 
'Twas there he won his fame. 
He's tall and slim, just like a 
stick, 
And a 
warm hearted Irishman. 
Every day I 
hear him say, 
I 
belong to the solid gang. 
CHORUS. 
Nolan, he's a 
Daisy—he is just the man— 
He never thinks when he drinks, 
He's emptying all the can! 
A 
solider man never lived, I 
tell you he's a 
charmer— 
The man that I 
have reference to, 
Is Nolan around the corner! 
One night a 
fight took place in his house, 
When Nolan displayed his skill! 
With a 
mallet in his hand, he order did command. 
Or some one he would kill! 
Terrence O'Brien was among the gang. 
He declared himself there and then. 
He pulled off his coat and gave a 
loud shout, 
When a 
general fight began! 
Nolan, he's a 
Daisy, &c.

We're the finest police in the world,

We arrest all offenders of law, 
And the people are proud to behold us; 
We walk the streets all the long dark night, 
And we take good care to be far from a

Our clubs are hard, and our shields are bright, 
We're the finest police in the world.

We're the finest police in the world, 
And our praises are sung in the papers; 
When we find a 
disorderly man, 
Very soon he is cued of his capers; 
We are the pride of the nation wide, 
And around our footsteps, no law is defied; 
The rogues all fear us on every side. 
We're the finest police in the world.

I 
am thinking to-day of dem years dat pass'd away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, it was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise ; 
Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart. 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
CHORtis. 
Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him. 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So ev'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gona, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [ bark, 
At night when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to my to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
I 
am very (:ld and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road; [ last, 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, I 
have reach'd de end at 
And I'm resting by do wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says ; 
But our mem'ry will turn roan, when our souls dey were 
tied down. 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

Music by VINCENT DAVDES. 
I've been dining and wining to- day you can see, 
In a 
manner remarkably loose, 
And to go on a 
spree I 
know would suit MG, 
For I 
mustn'n go home, 'tis no use. 
Oh I 
do feel so gay, so reckless and gay, 
My spirits so lively and spruce, 
I 
could sing or play in a 
juvenile way, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose. 
CEOEUS. 
I 
do feel so awfully loose, so loose, 
I 
do feel so awfully loose, so loose, 
Of course you can see I'm out on a 
spree, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose, 
I 
was walking and talking along Broadway, 
And feeling decidedly loose, 
I 
was laughing and chaffing with ladies so gay, 
The excitement must plead my excuse, 
All at once I 
descried a 
girl by my side, 
And my heart went pit pat like the deuce I 
For I 
give you my word this would not have occulted 
Had I 
not felt so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, &c. 
Then to woo and to coo I 
embraced every chance 
In a 
style that was certainly loose, 
For I 
pressed her to go to the Argyle to dance, 
And really would take no excuse. 
I 
said 'twould 131 bliss if she gave me a 
kiss, 
And to raise her veil tried to induce, 
Who is that! on my life I 
I've been courting my wife, 
Oh I 
did feel so awfully loose. 
I 
do feel, lee, 
Now what she said and I 
said may easily be guessed 
We both felt remarkably loose, 
The dispute grew so warm that I 
thought it the best 
To leave her by way of a 
truce. 
So I 
left her behind, and comfort I 
find 
In imbibing the generous juice; 
Oh I 
shall get it hot, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
For to- night I 
am out on the loose. 
I 
do feel, &c.

Words by J. C. GOODWLN. 
Music by EDNV'D E. 
Ric. 
When first the sound of battle came, 
We gaily marched away, 
For when we heard our country call, 
We could not but obey; 
For truth and right the first to fight 
And never known to flee, 
Our fathers recognize their sons, 
The gallant Ninth are we. 
CHORUS. 
A 
hundred years ago we stood in fight arrayed, boys, 
And boldly met the foe, for truth and liberty: 
Our voice is using still, and we should be obeyed, boys, 
Who gave our lives to make you free a 
hundred years ago. 
A 
little band of earnest men. 
Who knew no law but right; 
We just a 
century ago 
Set Freedom's torch 
We fought and fell and ages tell 
The story which you know, 
Of how the sun of Glory rose 
A 
hundred years ago.

The Less I 
Say of It, the Better. 
Written and Sung by Gus Wrir.TAvs, 
Ai-" 
Re Wonderful &no we do it, lo-ut we do," 
New songs will come around, 
As new subjects they abound, 
And the one I've, got, I 
think is just the cheese too, 
And if it makes a 
hit, 
Why then, I 
don't care a 
bit, 
For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a 
saying by the way, 
That you hear every day, 
Ind sometimes you read it in a 
letter; 
So with no more preface, 
I 
will introduce my case— 
For, I 
think the less I 
say of it, the better. 
A 
young man in the street, 
A 
pretty girl does meet, 
And introduces himself by sweet talking; 
She thinks he is so nice, 
For he talks as smooth as ice 
To her, as along the street they're walking; 
And not long atter that, 
She's got on a 
new hat, 
And way up-town we find that he has met her; 
And when it does get dark. 
They walk into the Park— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better. 
Tye been idle just a 
year, 
And I'm feeling rather queer, 
As to where I 
m going for to raise some money; 
For it's true, upon my life, 
Iv'e got a 
darlin'2 wife, 
And she can't live very long on love and honed; 
But there's one thing E0 fine, 
We've no children so divine, 
So poverty it don't c.cc.m such a 
fetter. 
But on this you may rely, 
There will come some by-and-bye--
Well. I 
think the less I 
say of it the better.

An ingenious little book of the thanmaturgic order, has been sent us, 
celled • ErMPTY DreEPTS,' and bound in such a 
vray as to give oppoitn-
iaity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap-
pearaece of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is so 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the leaves 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbiue, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or 3fephistophiles. A little

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards ha.s been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difn. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse. to venture upon asking the MOMEnt0113 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anythi .g that would seem to be an un lady-like enegura,ge-
meet. 
Ast'a 
result of this dilemma, manylivee are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cerde will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need riot be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords wite 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players!, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
