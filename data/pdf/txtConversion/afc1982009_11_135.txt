RITUAL AND SACRED NARRATIVES IN THE 
BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS 
The Blue Ridge Mountains of southwestern Virginia and northwestern 
North Carolina are a stronghold of fundamentalist religious activity 
especially among Primitive Baptists and related sects.1 The church is 
an important and pervasive presence in the lives of many people in the 
Blue Ridge. Brett Sutton, who has done fieldwork among Blue Ridge 
Baptists, has said, "Because religion is not just a compartment of life, 
but life s entire justification, the church's influence encompasses the 
whole community." My own fieldwork in the area proved this assess¬ 
ment to be true; people I interviewed repeatedly referred to their religious 
beliefs and experiences. 
In August and September of 1978, I conducted fieldwork in a five- 
county area of the Blue Ridge Mountains (Floyd, Patrick, Grayson, and 
Carroll counties in Virginia, and Allegheny and Wilkes counties in North 
Carolina) as part of the Blue Ridge Folklife Project sponsored by the 
American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress. Through photography 
and sound and video recording, a team of fieldworkers documented the 
folklife of a region along both sides of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Each team 
member had a special area of interest such as folk architecture or crafts; 
my particular concentrations were on folk narrative and folk belief, and 
the folklife of black residents of the area. Since folk religion was so 
1 
2 
pervasive, I was able to combine my interests into a focus on sacred 
narratives of white and black people in the region. At first I was not 
looking specifically for sacred narratives, but after a number of them 
occurred spontaneously in interviews and church services, I began to 
ask about people's religious experiences. 
Stories based on personal religious events are difficult to classify 
as to genre. Sandra K. D. Stahl limits her definition of personal narrative 
3 
to secular experiences to distinguish the genre from memorates which 
4 
deal with the supernatural. Sacred personal stories do resemble memorates 
in this supernatural quality, but unlike the memorate, the core belief of 
the sacred narrative is part of a system of folk religion.5 Hence, the 
scholarship of folk religion is more suggestive of approaches to the study 
of sacred personal narrative. 
Baptist folk religion provides the system of beliefs and behavior 
g 
patterns which are the major context of sacred narratives. The Primitive 
Baptist Church and similar sects are the primary religious influences on 
the folklife of the region. Other Baptist sects such as the Union, 
Missionary, New Covenant, and Progressive Primitive have many followers 
in the area, and I recorded narratives from members of several of these. 
Their stories are thematically related to those from Primitive Baptists. 
Primitive Baptist history is complicated by the division into black and 
white associations in the late nineteenth century; prior to that blacks 
and whites often met together for church services, and since the division 
7 
the black churches have taken a different path on many doctrinal matters. 
3 
For instance, the Progressive Primitive Baptist Church, a black sect, 
now has piano music in the service and Sunday schools, both of which 
the white Primitive Baptists have steadfastly resisted. The New Covenant 
Baptist Association, another black church, was an offshoot of the white 
Union Baptist Association, a more liberal group than the Primitives, and 
the New Covenant Church has pianos and Sunday schools. The Missionary 
Baptists, as their name implies, believe in evangelism and actively try 
to recruit new members; but the Primitive Baptists believe just the opposite: 
"They see no point in campaigning for lost souls, and neither cajole nor 
g 
coerce sinners to join the church." Even within Primitive Baptist Churches 
there is some disagreement: "Because of their autonomy and distrust of 
institutional structure, no single description of doctrine is applicable to 
9 
all." 
Despite all the differences among Baptist sects, there is one central 
belief that relates them together: the concept that salvation must be an 
individual emotional experience; one must be "born again." Some Baptists 
believe in free will, that people can save themselves by choosing Jesus, 
but the Primitive Baptists believe in predestination and unconditional 
election. "Salvation is granted only to the elect chosen by God before 
the world was founded, who may be made aware of their election through 
the gift of grace. Good works and mere human will are totally ineffectual 
in obtaining salvation . . . But whether a person believes in the 
elect or free will, to be born again he or she still must experience sal¬ 
vation directly. Sacred narratives often deal with this conversion 
4 
experience, and although there are some important differences between 
the stories of Primitive Baptists and other Baptists, there are many 
similarities in underlying structures, images, and functions. 
The sacred narratives I am concerned with here can be divided into 
three categories: 1) conversion experiences in which a person changes 
from a life of sin to one of salvation, 2) calling experiences in which a 
man is called by God to preach, and 3) healing experiences in which a 
person is cured through prayer. I shall concentrate on three specific 
conversion stories, one calling, and four healing narratives which are 
representative of others I heard and collected in the Blue Ridge; I shall 
also make references to published sacred oral narratives.'*'''' The conversion 
and calling stories were collected in interviews at the homes of informants, 
and the healing stories were collected in homes and during church services 
as part of testimonies. The interviews were all conducted on front porches, 
often with the spouse present; one interview was very close to a natural 
context since two friends talked spontaneously with little intrusion from 
the collectors. The church services were recorded in their entirety with 
the permission of the preachers and elders of each church. Sacred 
narratives seem to be told frequently because of their great importance in 
people's lives. Brett Sutton has said of the Primitive Baptist's narratives 
of conversion that they are "the most finely formed product of their oral 
tradition. Although they occur initially as mystical private events, they are 
cast ultimately in verbal form, since no personal experience is really 
complete until it has been shared, and, to an extent, validated through 
12 
5 
public testimony." I agree with Sutton about the importance of the 
narratives in Baptist tradition and also about their validating and 
communal functions, but I think they have many other complex functions 
which can best be analyzed through a consideration of the ritual aspects 
of the narratives. 
William M. Clements' analysis of conversion experiences of 
Pentecostals in northeast Arkansas was the first folklore study to use 
the ritual process theory of Victor Turner to interpret rituals in American 
13 
folk churches. Turner's concepts of "liminality" and "communitas" 
also have a bearing on the specifics of sacred narratives being considered 
here. Turner s theory is based on the liminal phase of van Gennep's rites 
de_pa5sage, the transition state between separation in which the individual 
is detached from the existing social structure and incorporation in which 
the individual is reintegrated into society.14 The liminal or transition 
stage is the most important in Turner's scheme because the unique 
characteristics of people in this stage have symbolic significance across 
cultural lines. "Liminal entities are neither here nor there; they are 
betwixt and between the positions assigned and arranged by law, custom, 
convention, and ceremonial. As such, their ambiguous and indeterminate 
attributes are expressed by a rich variety of symbols in the many societies 
that ritualize social and cultural transitions," The liminal state as a 
"moment in and out of time" is relatively structureless which in turn 
suggests the ideal model of communitas, a sense of human interrelatedness 
16 
without status or hierarchy. Communitas is opposed to structured society 
6 
« 
and hence is labeled anti-structure, but both sides are necessary: 
" . . . social life is a type of dialectical process that involves successive 
experience of high and low, communitas and structure, homogeneity and 
17 
differentiation, equality and inequality." Turner discusses the 
characteristics of liminality in a variety of cultures including the Christian 
tradition, and Clements has applied it to fundamentalist conversion 
experiences. Much remains to be analyzed, however, in terms of the 
ideal of communitas as expressed in narrative form. 
For fundamentalist Christians in the Blue Ridge, communitas is 
interconnected with social structure in that the ideal of human oneness is 
part of a system of beliefs that regulates behavior, as well as being a 
private experience outside of society. The churches condone and try to 
inspire religious experiences, but they occur spontaneously for each 
individual. As Turner has pointed out, " . . .if the cultural form of 
communitas--as found in liminality--can correspond with an actual 
experience of communitas, the symbols there presented may be experienced 
more deeply than in any other context, if the ritual subject has what 
18 
theologians would call 'proper dispositions."' The people I interviewed 
had the proper dispositions for the experience in that all had been reared 
in Baptist churches; most had parents and grandparents who were members, 
preachers, and elders of the church, so that their religious beliefs had 
been internalized from childhood. Thus, they are prepared for the liminal 
experience when it finally happens. 
There is a need to communicate the liminal experience to other 
7 
members of the church, and the sacred narrative fulfills this function. 
When a personal narrative is related, it reinforces the original belief 
within the church community. A structureless experience becomes 
restructured in narrative form after it is over. Thus, the narrative is a 
means of reconciling communitas with social structure, of moving from 
the liminal stage to the incorporation stage. The narrative contains 
images and patterns which are symbolic of this ritual process. We need 
to look more closely at the narratives, then, to see exactly how the ritual 
process is symbolically reflected. 
The narratives symbolically express the opposition between social 
structure and communitas by contrasting the lowly state of sinners in 
society with the exalted state of the saved. This is often done by a 
description of the personal sinfulness of the narrator's previous life , 
usually in concrete, specific terms. Morris Keith (pseudonyms are used 
throughout), an eighty-seven-year-old black farmer from Allegheny County, 
North Carolina, and a member of the New Covenant Baptist Church, 
described his condition this way: 
I used to be wild as a buck, had an old thirty-two twenty 
pistol, put it under my arm, and I couldn't go to church without 
half drunk with that old pistol tucked underneath here or nothin'. 
Its a wonder I hadn't a been dead. 
Elmer Hascall, a seventy-nine-year-old white Primitive Baptist 
preacher from Patrick County, Virginia, made two references to his 
8 
A 
sinful life: 
Oh, law, I was the greatest, still just as great a sinner . . . 
I was the worst there was then. 
I would get drunk and fight and scratch and have as big a 
time in the world .... 
Fighting and drinking seem to be the primary characteristics of the sinful 
social life; sexual promiscuity was not mentioned, but this was probably 
because wives were present during the taping of the stories. 
Turner emphasizes low status, especially poverty and the resulting 
19 
low social standing, as a pre-condition of liminality, and Clements sees 
poverty as an important element in communitas among Pentecostal Church 
20 
members in northeast Arkansas. However, poverty does not seem to 
be a significant factor in the communitas of Blue Ridge Baptists; although 
many of them had poor backgrounds, they are now relatively prosperous 
and rarely mention poverty directly or symbolically. The symbol of low 
status in their sacred narratives is the sinful state of the secular world, 
the polar opposite of the state of grace in liminality. 
Another way the contrast is made between communitas and social 
structure is through the concept of "worldliness" as a continuing tempta¬ 
tion even after conversion. The phrase "being in this world but not of it" 
succinctly captures the idea. Elmer Hascall views worldliness as an 
external temptation which causes an internal struggle. 
9 
We see so much ever day that keeps our mind off of things 
like that, the good things; we're lookin' at the beauty of the 
world and pleasures there is in the world and stuff like that. 
More and more and more. 
There’s a warfare gets started in you. You want to do the 
right thing, and a lot of times doin’ the wrong thing .... Born 
of the spirit, that's Christ pullin' in you all for glory, and still 
we got our old selves to deal with. Our self is lookin' after the 
things of this world. 
During the liminal phase, the old self is lost, but in the post-liminal 
phase or reincorporation into social structure, the old self reappears 
because of the temptations of the world. The narrator uses the image of 
inner warfare to symbolize the conflict between communitas and social 
structure. 
Social structure is made even more apparent in the testimony of the 
saved by references to those who try to change but remain of the world. 
These comments usually come at the end of a sacred narrative. They are 
not part of the story but rather act as a transition back to conversation. 
Morris Keith's wife, Amy, said as he finished his story: 
Amy: A lot of folks don't know what the spirit is. 
Morris: No, but I owned it boy .... 
10 
Amy: Now a lot of them don't get changed like that either. Some 
of 'em just get up and give their hands. They don't think 
they have to pray for it. 
Morris: Just a handshake ain't worth two cents. You've got to 
pray and let God, let God get in your heart, and boy you 
know it. 
Some people then can have a superficial conversion, but they fail to go 
through the liminal phase, fail to experience communitas, and they remain 
symbols of the social structure. Harry Jessup, an eighty-eight-year-old 
black elder in the Progressive Primitive Baptist Church, uses the phrase 
"born again" as a contrast to those who do not have the spirit. 
You know, you hardly ever run across anybody now but what 
they don't belong to the church, say they're Christian, say they 
belong to the church. But I don't look at it that way. You could 
belong to the church, and then not be no Christian. You see what 
I'm talkin' about? But borned again Christians, and you have been 
born of the spirit. You don't find; many of them don't take time to get 
that duty. 
His use of a rhetorical question and his emphasis on "borned again" 
indicate that he is trying to convince the listener of the truth and importance 
of this concept. 
I have concentrated on symbols of social structure in sacred narratives 
to this point, but social structure is defined by its relation to the 
11 
structureless experience of communitas in the liminal phase, and the 
qualities of this experience must be delineated for a full understanding 
of the ritual process. All of the people I interviewed saw their conver¬ 
sion as dependent on God which is in keeping with Turner's findings 
that "spontaneous communitas appears to be very frequently associated 
with mystical power and to be regarded as a charism or grace sent by 
21 
the deities or ancestors." In sacred narratives, the mystical power of 
God is often contrasted to the impotence of humans to effect such a 
change. Elmer Hascall said, "We know that they's somethin' taken 
place that all the people couldn't a caused no matter how great nor how 
strong nor nothin'; they couldn't a caused these things to happen with 
you." Morris Keith phrased it this way: "If God's behind you, I said, 
Almighty God, there's somebody behind you. Tain't like no man nor 
woman in this world . . . ." Gladys Hill, a seventy-four-year-old 
Missionary Baptist from Wilkes County, North Carolina, commented, 
"When you get reborned again, it'll be somethin' that this world can't 
give you, and they can't take it away." And later she added, "But yet 
it's not me, it's Christ that's in me. It's His spirit." God or Christ is 
at the center of communitas for all of these born again Christians. 
The liminal phase itself as described in conversion stories is 
characterized by disorientation, visions, and emotional release. The 
disorientation seems to be a result of an altered time sense. "Communitas 
is almost always thought of or portrayed by actors [[in the social drama^ 
as a timeless condition, an eternal now, as 'a moment in and out of time,' 
12 
or as a state to which the structural view of time is not applicable." 22 
This can be clearly seen in the descriptions of several narrators. Morris 
Keith. 1,1,1 didn't know when I came to myself; I didn't know what I'd 
done. I d been shoutin' all over that church. He sure laid His hands on 
me." Elmer Hascall: "I never remembered not one thing that taken place. 
I left this world as far as I'm concerned. _Five second pause.' Ever little 
bit all that day. I just feel like I was a-droppin' off; there wasn't a pain 
about me nowhere." "I didn't know nothing then for a long time. I laid 
there, I don t know how long. When the Lord brought me to, I was laying 
on a little bench all the way across the room."23 All three narrators 
seem to have been in and out of time so that on returning to ordinary 
time structure they felt disoriented. 
It is during the peak of the liminal phase that most people have 
visions; they see figures and lights and hear voices. This phenomenon 
24 
is common among Primitive Baptists, but it is not found as frequently 
in the other Baptist sects although Gladys Hill, a Missionary Baptist, 
had a vision during her conversion: 
And I was prayin', and that barn it was a made out of logs 
and daubed with old red dirt. And that barn just disappeared when 
that light appeared, and that place was just so gold, and seemed 
like somethin', a light that bright would hit you in the eyes. Now 
you know how a car light hurts your eyes; well that hit my body, 
somethin did, and that light it wasn't , it didn't hurt my eyes a'tall. 
13 
It just come right to me, and it come to me just like that there, 
and it just went all over me, and that, I just, I just felt it. I 
didn't even, I just. 
The feelings at the moment of liminality are obviously difficult to express 
after a person returns to structured society so that Mrs. Hill's inarticulate 
stuttering at the end convinces the listener of the power of her experience. 
Some individual Primitive Baptists are more likely to have visions than 
others. Elmer Hascall has had several visions in his life; the first occurred 
when he was nineteen and fell off a mule-drawn piece of farm equipment 
and was in imminent danger of being killed. 
And, they, they ain t no use in me tellin' you how fast things 
like that, they can happen in a second. And I saw hell, if any 
man s ever saw it, I saw it wide open, and I knew that was my own; 
I knew that that was where I was headed. And I don't know, there's 
a voice while I was standin' there, it couldn't have been over jus: 
a few seconds, and the mules just stopped when the tongue broke, 
but they, they s scared to death. And, I don't know, when I saw, 
saw my doom there, where I was headed, why I guess I prayed. I 
don't remember. But anyway, there's a voice spoke just as plain 
as you all or any of you spoke today and says, "Fear not, my son." 
And here I am years and years after that a tellin' that whether you 
believe it or not. But how the drill went off me. I'll never know. 
Only God'll know. 
14 
Despite this experience, Mr. Hascall continued to lead what he 
considered a sinful life for another twenty-eight years until he had a 
vision which was his calling to be a preacher. His calling narrative is 
very similar to conversion stories except that the message he received 
is more specific. 
A little while, a month or two after I joined the church, good 
meetin' on Saturday I thought at the church. Come back home, and 
I had eight kids, kept me a movin' around a whole lot to keep a 
few clothes on 'em and a little bite to eat. Anyway, after the 
meetin', I came back and ate dinner and went up on the garden, it 
was right up on the hill, right above the house. I went up there 
hoein' in the garden after dinner, and I just got to studyin' about 
Granddad Blankenship. That, all that top of the mountain around 
where I lived there wasn't a, a person that I ever remember of that 
ever said aught agin him. He left as good a name as any man that 
I ever knew. And, uh, I's just studyin' about him while a workin' 
up there. And this thought come to me, I didn't say nothin' , but 
I just thought it that, that I'd just love to be half the man that 
Granddad Blankenship was, just leave half the name that he left. 
And by then that thought come to me, there's a voice spoke just 
as plain says, "Follow me, and I'll make you a fisherman of men." 
Well, I, I never let nobody know it, I kept that to myself. Of 
course, I commenced to beggin' the Lord to send somebody else 
15 
that, uh, a brother was in the same church, and a lot of male 
members down there, all of 'em was better than I was, to send 
some of them. But that was my lot; I carried that for nearly a 
year. 
I was a workin' at Roanoke, go over on Monday mornin' and 
work 'til Friday evenin' and come home. And left home one mornin', 
Monday mornin', and got right above the house, well might as well 
tell it all I reckon. And a little piece above the house, I was right 
by myself, commenced to singin' "How Firm the Foundation." And 
there's eight stanzas to that song, and I sung it word by word, just 
word by word just like its laid down from there over to Floyd court¬ 
house, and I got to cryin' 'til I couldn't see to drive hardly. Look 
like there's just somethin' around me that's a drawin' like a big 
band of something. I got just out of Floyd and from there to the top of 
Brent Mountain right this side of Roanoke. I never remembered not 
one thing that taken place. I left this world as far as I'm concerned. 
(Five second paused Ever little bit all that day. I just feel like I 
was a droppin' off, there wasn't a pain about me nowhere. 
Went back to where I slept, cleaned up, gettin' ready to go 
to bed, and standin' before the mirror shavin', and nobody never 
seen such a face as I saw in there. And there's a voice spoke 
again and says, "If you don't take up your callin' this is your last 
night on earth." That's the reason I go and take my failures and all 
these things, its somethin' takin' place that causes these things. 
16 
there’s a cause for all things. Cause for all of us bein' sittin' 
r 
here. After a comment by one of the listeners, a short discussion, 
and a narrative about his mother, Mr. Hascall continued his story71 
After the voice spoke and told me that was the last night on 
earth if I didn't take up my calling, except ye take up your calling. 
As quick as I could, I got back in the bedroom, just fell across the 
bed. Ain t no human bein' ever, never has nor I don't guess ever 
will lay on the bed that I laid on. It was just like downy feathers, 
just as, well just as soft as feathers, and they just commenced, 
seemed like goin' up like that. I looked out at the winder, and 
there s a bright star shinin' , and all at once that changed, and 
there He was. In another scripture He says, "I am your bright and 
mornin' star." And I saw afterwards. How's that? And He's been 
with me through all that. 
Mr. Hascall was the only person I interviewed who had a series of 
visions during his life. The fact that he is a preacher in the Primitive 
Baptist Church may explain his greater propensity for visions. At any 
rate, the visions which appear to him and others seem to be traditionally 
based: voices which quote Biblical scripture, intense light, bright stars, 
2 5 
and figures dressed in white. The sources of these images are the Bible, 
sermons, church testimonies, and other sacred narratives so that they are 
part of the print and oral traditions of this folk religion. 
The emotional release described in Mr. Hascall's narrative is 
17 
echoed over and over in other people's stories. He said, "... and I 
got to cryin' 'til I couldn't see to drive hardly." "I pulled that old car 
over to the side of the road and stopped and of course I'd a-been I was prayin' 
and a-cryin' you know the tears got so big in my eyes I couldn't see to 
2 6 
drive." Morris Keith said in the middle of relating his conversion 
experience: "And I just laid down and cried and prayed all night." Mr. 
Keith also expressed his emotions through "shouting." During church 
services when people give testimony by telling sacred narratives, they 
often cry and become very emotional so that the release described within 
the narrative is also part of the context in which they are told. 
However, the crying and shouting are just outward expressions of 
the deeper feeling of communitas. All the narrators speak of their 
feeling as a spiritual state that comes at the exact moment that their 
lives change radically from sin to salvation. Morris Keith: "Good Lord, 
I got a blessin' , and I just changed. [He and his wife both laugh.j I 
just, when the Lord blessed me, I throwed away all this old stuff. Throwed 
away drinkin', and carryin' pistols, and got to servin' the Lord and livin' 
a better life." It was the new feeling that marked the change. "I'd just 
feel something run all over me that I never had felt . . . ." Gladys Hill's 
description is similar. "When He came into my heart. He changed my 
heart. He made me a new person, and I tried to change myself, and I 
couldn't. And ever since that I have never wanted to take back up these 
things that I did before that happened." Her case is typical in that the 
radical change is permanent despite the temptations and inner conflicts 
18 
between the spirit and the material world; as Elmer Hascall said, you 
"carry it with you as long as you live." 
Dependence on God, disorientation, visions, emotional release, 
radical change to a new inner feeling, and permanence of change charac¬ 
terize the descriptions of the liminal phase, but other qualities are im¬ 
portant as well in rendering the experience of communitas in narrative 
form: setting and poetic image. Both are concrete rather than abstract 
relating them to Turner's point that the "concrete, personal, imagist 
mode of thinking is highly characteristic of those in love with existential 
27 
communitas." Each storyteller carefully sets his narrative in a specific 
place before describing the conversion. Morris Keith: "Used to be woods 
right out here, all this out here, there was woods, and we had this 
cleared right down here. And I'd go out there at night after I'd come from 
the church and say, I'd better go out here and pray in the woods right 
there." Elmer Hascall described the garden above his house and the 
highway he was travelling in concrete terms, and Gladys Hill gave 
minute details of the tobacco barn she was in: "... and I was down on 
that floor, dirt floor beside that old rock furnace if you've ever seen one; 
I doubt whether you have or not." Because of the mystical and spiritual 
nature of liminality, these concrete details are necessary to ground the 
experience in everyday reality. 
The images of communitas are concrete for the same reason. Once 
the individual has returned to a structured existence, he or she needs 
concrete images to communicate what is essentially an abstract experience. 
19 
The voices of God and angels speak in direct concrete images: "Fear 
not, my son," "fisherman of men," "... this is your last night on 
earth," "arise now and shine," and "You quit singing that song," and 
the narrator uses similar images: "like a big band," "a bright star shinin'," 
"like downy feathers," and "a light that bright." These images make the 
experience more real and understandable to the storyteller and his or 
her audience. 
The telling of the sacred conversion narrative throughout the rest of 
a person's life is necessary to reestablish the sense of communitas back 
in structured society and to inspire others to have a similar experience. 
Other closely related traditional expressions such as prayer, worship 
services, healing narratives, and hymn singing serve the same function. 
Prayer is an important factor because it is an element leading up to the 
liminal phase, and it is a continuing activity in the post-liminal stage. 
Morris Keith and Gladys Hill both prayed intensely and at length before 
their conversion experiences, and Elmer Hascall thinks he prayed before 
he heard a voice for the first time. They continue to pray in church and 
at home every day; this is one means of staying in contact with the 
mystical power they felt as part of liminality. 
Regular attendance at worship service is another way of maintaining 
the spirit of communitas. Turner points out the importance of a sense of 
29 
the "essentialandgeneric human bond" in communitas. The coming 
together of kindred spirits at church services is a significant reminder of 
this bond. The liminal phase is experienced individually, but the core 
20 
feeling binds the individual with all of humankind. A statement by Elmer 
Hascall expresses this sentiment on the folk level: "Well it says that 
these things—I can't quote that exactly—but we know that we have 
passed from death unto life because we love the brethren." One must 
die before he or she can be reborn, and the proof of rebirth is love of 
the brethren. The church service is the method within the social 
structure for love of the brethren to be expressed and reinforced; it is 
where the individual and the communal come together and are resolved. 
Morris Keith said: 
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't go to church .... I 
enjoy goin' to the church. I get a blessin'. He gives me a feelin' 
that nobody can give me; nobody in this world can give me a feelin' 
like God can give it to me. I don't care how old you are and how 
stiff you are, you'll move laughs_ when He gets a hold of you 
laughs . Yeah, you'll feel like a young man. Yes sir. 
The church service renews the original "blessing" for Mr. Keith every 
time he participates. 
Hymn singing as a traditional part of the church service also 
functions as a renewal of communitas. Singing is a component of 
conversion narratives so that there is a direct thematic link between 
liminality and normal activities within the social structure. Singing was 
Mr. Keith’s first expression of communitas after his conversion. "They 
couldn't hardly commence singin' soon enough . . . and, boy, when they did 
21 
start singin', well I'd been up and shoutin' all over the house, and I 
didn't even know much when I got up. Boy, I had a time there." Mr. 
Hascall was singing "How Firm the Foundation" just before he had one 
of his visions. Brett Sutton cites two Primitive Baptist sacred personal 
narratives in which hymn singing is a key element, and he comments 
that Primitive hymns "are integral components of a deeply internalized 
world view, and have a special staying power unmatched by even the 
best-loved secular song. The expressive range of the repertory is broad, 
and there is always a hymn one can turn to for special comfort in times 
30 
of distress." The hymns sustain communitas when the tribulations of 
structured existence seem to overcome the spirit. 
The healing narratives are told as part of the testimonies at church 
services as well as outside the church, and they are directly related to 
the conversion narratives in theme and function. Healing stories are 
similar to conversion narratives, in that they have prayer as a component, 
emphasize dependency on God, and express strong emotional release. 
Harry Jessup's healing narrative has the same basic pattern as conversion 
experiences since the healing effects a radical change in his life. 
Jessup: But I study the Bible more now than any one thing for the 
past thirty, forty years. I had an experience with that. I, I 
promised the Lord if He would do one thing for me what I would 
do, and He done that. And I've done my best to live up to it, 
what I told him that I would do, and that is—can you see 
22 
anything on my neck exceptin' the skin? 
Mullen: Uh, where? 
Jessup: Anywhere on my neck, anywhere on it, 
Mullen: No. I can’t. What do you? 
Jessup: I really want to make plain to you now. I told that young 
man about, uh, about what I promised the Lord and what I 
told Him I'd do and what the Lord done for me. I had a large 
goiter on my neck, a large one. Couldn't even pass my shirt 
over it. And, uh, my family all was at home then. Pretty 
tight times, you know. But I promised the Lord if He, if 
He wouldn't have mercy on me and, and remove that, what I 
would do. And I remember one mornin' I never will forget that, 
that knot went away, to my knowledge it just seemed, it just 
all just disappeared and went down. I've got a son in his 
sixty-seventh year, and I've got a daughter that's sixty, 
but if they were here, they all would witness to what I've 
told you. They know it to be a fact. Now, would you doubt 
a God like that? 
In many ways this is a conversion story except that communitas is 
experienced through healing rather than through a vision or a new feeling. 
The story functions more directly to provide evidence of God's power than 
do the conversion narratives, and the techniques of pointing out physical 
evidence in the middle of the story and asking a rhetorical question at 
23 
the end reinforce this function. Mr. Jessup indicated that he also told 
this story as part of the testimonies at church. 
I recorded three healing narratives during worship services, and 
although they have similarities to Mr. Jessup's, they seem to have been 
adapted to the particular circumstances of the church context. John 
Sherfey, a Baptist preacher in Stanley, Virginia, was interviewed by Jeff 
Titon and gave this definition of testimonies: "And what I mean by 
testimony is that something that's happened to them that they feel like 
that God's blessed them in a certain special way and they want to share 
31 
it with somebody else." In many churches, a time is set aside for 
testimonies; at a Progressive Primitive Baptist Church in Patrick County, 
Virginia, the deacon invited members to testify. "If the Lord have 
redeemed your soul and filled you with the spirit .... It ought to be 
in there that you want to share that with somebody." The important 
sentiment here is that people should want to share their experiences 
with others. 
Immediately after the deacon called on people, a woman in the 
congregation rose, came to the front, and related the following (1 have 
indicated the congregation's responses in parentheses. Although many 
people spoke or shouted at once, only a dominant phrase has been included 
to give a sense of congregational participation]: 
I’d like to take this opportunity (That's right) to say thank you, 
Jesus, for bein' so good to me (Yes). Thank Him for watchin' over 
us last night and wakin' us up this mornin' (That's right)—come into 
24 
« 
the House of God. And when I come I always have to say thank 
you, Jesus (That's right) cause some of you don't know how good 
He has been to me (That's right), but He's been good to me (Amen). 
He brought me a long ways, and He let me stay here when the 
doctor thought I couldn't stay 'til I seen my cure and all able to 
take care of itself (It's a blessing). And I thank Him for that 
because it looked like at one time that He couldn't save me. And 
I just asked the Lord if it be His will to just spare my life (Amen, 
praise God) until the baby was big enough to take care of itself 
(All right). But He spared my life, and He did just that, and why 
I think I say thank you, Jesus (Amen). Just thank you. Besides 
all these other good things (Oh, Lord) that He's done for us. He's 
good to us, children (Yes, He is). And He's _baby crying on this 
journey. And I don't have nothin' to do if it look like I'm gettin' 
weak but just say, "Lord Jesus, help me to hold out, help me." 
And I can just feel the spirit, you know, I can feel somethin' — 
(Yes, yes) and I don't mind lettin' everybody know that Jesus is a 
friend to us, and He's got all the power. I've done knowed that. 
And He's able to carry us through this sinful world (Amen). Safe 
and sound if you just keep your heart and mind on it. Now you have 
to do that. And, uh. I'm just so thankful that He let me live to come 
this mornin' (Yes, sir) to look at my sisters and brothers who I love 
dearly. And I'm just thankful for that. Thank you, Jesus, for the 
many blessings that You've bestowed upon me. Won't y'all pray 
25 
for me that I just keep runnin' on, and I'll pray for y'all (Amen). 
Testimony such as this within a church context focuses less on the 
healing experience itself than on the emotions associated with it. This 
woman concentrates on thanking God for the blessing she has received 
so that there is less emphasis on narrative structure and more on a series 
of formulaic expressions which bring the congregation into the performance. 
Thus, the potentially dramatic episode of an infant's survival is mentioned 
in passing but not developed as it would be under different storytelling 
32 
circumstances. These changes in narrative style come about because 
of the emphasis on the sharing of an experience with others; the personal 
side becomes secondary to the communal. 
Another testimony at the same service reveals a similar communal 
orientation. 
Christian friends, this mornin' I'd like to say how glad I am 
to be in the House of the Lord (Right, brother). Always glad to be 
here at the service, you know (uh, uh). I want to thank the Lord 
for my wife (That's right). I want to thank Him for my family, 
friends, and loved ones. And especially you this mornin' (Amen). 
And I'd like to share some real Christian experience, somethin' 
that happened to me this week (That's right). Uh, this past week 
I had to send a medical report down to my doctor. And this past 
week on my job, he called me up, said I would have to get the 
preparation, come on down and see us a few days (Yes). And I got 
26 
back home and I said, "Well, Lord, you know the best." (That's 
right) In business like this, settle affairs, had to make the prepara¬ 
tion. I said, "Well, Lord, you know the best." (That's right) And 
I talked to the Lord about it (That's right, brother). And the next 
day when I got to the hospital, took some examinations and things, 
you know (Uh, uh). Had my bag packed and doctor said, "Go on 
back home, now; we don't need you." (Have faith in the Lord, 
brother) jMany people respond at the same time here"^ In all this 
process here, I've learned to read, uh, Hebrew, the eleventh chapter, 
talks all about faith, how his friend, the past Christians, how they 
made it on faith (That's what it tells youl Today I'd like to 
recommend to you, uh, Hebrew the eleventh chapter (Amen, yes sir), 
It was very good for me, and the Lord will stand by us, in all our 
troubles (Yes He will, yes sir). I pray for Christian faith in all 
my troubles (Amen). 
This young man (he appeared to be in his thirties) gives more 
narrative details than the woman did, and this may be because the event 
is fresher in his mind; it happened the previous week while the woman's 
seems to have happened years ago. The congregation responds to the 
immediacy of the event with more animated expression at the point where 
he reveals the cure. He makes a direct link between his personal 
experience and the communal good by saying he would "like to share" 
his experience and by citing a Bible verse at the end which he feels can 
27 
help others in times of stress. 
The greatest effort at reconciling the unstructured personal 
experience of communitas with ongoing structured society is made at 
the church service. Each member of the church exists within a political- 
economic-social structure with its own hierarchies and status positions; 
they may be farmers, doctors, or laborers in the outside world, but 
within the church they share in undifferentiated communitas as equals. 
Thus the rituals and formulas of the church service function symbolically 
to bring them together. One more healing narrative from another church, 
the New Covenant Baptist Church, will illustrate how these narratives 
are formed and styled to fit this function. 
I'm thanking you Lord for remembering me (Yeah) when I 
wasn't mindful of myself (Jesus). You kept me, Jesus (Yes). You 
hovered over me (Yes). You let me walk in my own way (Yes). One 
day you touched me (Yeah). And you waked me up (Oh, yeah). 
Ain't you glad of that? (Yes) I'm so happy this mornin' (Yeah). 
Thank you, Jesus (Thank you). I'm still on the side of the Lord 
(Yeah). Father, we have sick people (Yeah) all over the world 
(Yeah), and Lord Jesus I know you're a healer (Yeah). I know you 
can do it, God (Yes sir). I'm just askin’ you. Lord Jesus, lay 
hands on the sick (Sure). Heal 'em, Lord Jesus (Yeah). I know 
you, Lord (Yeah) because you've raised me up (Yeah). One day I 
was so sick (Yeah) my body was racked with pain (Oh, yes), but 
28 
Lord I asked you, Jesus (Yes, sir) to come into my heart (Yes) 
that I may be able to say a prayer (Yes). Let me be able to walk 
again (Yeah). You done that, Jesus (Yes, Lord), and He done it 
for you (Yes). I know He can do it (Yeah) this mornin' (This mornin'). 
I know He touched me. 
She continues from here with a prayer for others to be touched in 
all walks of life, out on the highway, in prisons, etc. As with the other 
healing narratives performed in church, this one has been adapted to 
traditional communal formulas; the rhythm and the call and response 
pattern serve to make the individual one with the congregation, and the 
narrative is deemphasized. The overall movement of her testimony from 
beginning to end indicates the weaving together of personal and communal 
concerns. She starts with the personal (thanking God for her blessings), 
moves to the communal (the existence of sick people in the world), goes 
back to the personal (her own experience in being healed), and finally 
ends with the communal (Jesus can heal all who are sick). Her personal 
experience becomes an example and an inspiration for others; the individual 
liminal event is reintegrated into society. 
Sacred personal narratives in the Blue Ridge mountains, including 
conversion, calling, and healing stories, are part of a larger ritual 
process and can be fully understood only in terms of the relationship 
between narrative forms, ritual models, and social contexts. Sacred 
narratives describe the liminal phase of rites de passage which culminates 
29 
« 
in an experience of communitas, a mystical contact with God and a sense 
of the oneness of humankind. This basically unstructured ideal of 
communitas has to be balanced with the structured, status-oriented 
system in which people exist as social beings. The sacred narratives 
are a significant means of reincorporating the communitas ideal into 
social structure. The oral narrative form structures an unstructured 
mystical ideal in order to communicate it meaningfully to the world.
