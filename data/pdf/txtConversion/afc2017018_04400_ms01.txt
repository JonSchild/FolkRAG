I: 
It’s a scary thought to do such wonderful interviews and then get home and realize your recorder wasn’t 
working. 
P: 
Oh, no. 
I: 
All right. I think we’re ready to go. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Are you ready? 
I2: 
Yup. 
I: 
All right. So, the first thing is to say thank you. 
P: 
Oh, you’re welcome. 
I: 
Thank you so much for participating in this interview and thank you for the work that you do. We believe 
it’s really valuable and important, and we want to help other people understand that. So, that’s the biggest 
reason we’re doing these interviews, so thank you for the work that you do. As we have been talking about 
what we’re really interested in are the stories, and we’re going to start with your story. So, I’d like to know how 
you got into this work, when, why? 
P: 
Well, I’ve been thinking about it, and you know, I read the questions yesterday [57.17], and I was 
thinking that, you know, my great grandparents lived here, and my Grandma—I think she was 85 almost when 
she passed away, so that’s about 12 or 13, sorry [sobbing], and you know, as she got older she was really 
sharp for a really long time. Actually, ‘til the end. [Still sobbing] this isn’t even that much of a story—I don’t 
know why it just—she got sick just like with a regular cold. And I had to have been 12 or 13 and my mom had 
to go to work, and my dad had to go to work, so they’re like [inaudible], you know, I was already babysitting 
children at that time, and they’re like, “Do you think that you can go over and take care of Grandma.” You 
know, she was just kind of throwing up and, you know, just needed like a glass of water or whatever. So, to me 
it was [still sobbing] a really big deal. You know, can you do it? And I’m like, yeah. I can. No problem. You 
know, so the whole day I just, you know, if she got sick, I took care of it. I wiped her face. I got her water or 
whatever, so I would think that that’s probably my first—where I took care of a little old person, you know. But 
my mom has always taken care of older people, like, even my grandparent’s friends, and things like that, and I 
would accompany her. So, I don’t know if it’s from my mom or—but the first time I really did for pay, I think I 
was 27 years old, and my Grandpa’s sister, my Great Aunt, had lost her husband, and she was living with my 
dad’s cousin, her son and daughter-in-law. And it’s a lot for—you know, they couldn’t leave the house really, 
and leave her alone. So, they had a garden, and they needed—I mean like a huge garden like out in the fields, 
you know, where they needed to leave the house. And so, anyway, I would just go for like 5 hours three times 
a week, 15 hours a week, and just hang with her. And eventually my great uncle, her brother, moved out there 
too, and so then I had both of them. So, that’s kind of just how I think I was, you know, single, and didn’t have 
any kids, so I was an available person. 
I: 
And so, the caregiving you’ve done has always been for family? 
P: 
Yeah. I don’t—I couldn’t think of a time where it was someone not, you know, not one of my relatives. 
I: 
And can you explain who it is you’re taking care of right now? 
P: 
Oh, sure. I take care of my great uncle [54.32]. We call him T. That’s uncle in Spanish. He’s my 
Grandma’s brother, and he is on my mom’s side. My mom’s uncle. 
I: 
And then C’s Father?

P: 
Yes. Yup. C’s father. 
I: 
Oh, you call him T. 
P: 
Yeah. T. Uh-huh, yup [laughs]. 
I: 
That confused me a little bit. 
P: 
Yeah. Sorry [laughing]. Yeah. His name is M, but I call him T. 
I: 
So, can you explain what it is that you do for M or for T? 
P: 
Sure. Usually when I get there [53.58] he is in bed. I come about 10:30, 11 o’clock. Sometimes he’s 
awake, but usually I start with—I like to go in and say, hi, and I usually take my—at least have M. with, my 3-
year-old. And try to get him to get outta bed ‘cause a lotta time, you know, he just is warm, and he wants to 
stay in bed, you know. So, without asking too many times where I feel like I’m annoying, I try to coax him outta 
bed, and then he uses the bathroom, and we start by making breakfast, and eating breakfast together. 
I: 
And he, if I’m not mistaken, has dementia? 
P: 
Yes. Yup. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And do you know how advanced that is? And how does that affect the care that you give? 
P: 
I really couldn’t say how advanced it is, but I introduce myself every time. I mean two things. He has 
probably like 100 nieces and nephews because he has a lot of brothers and sisters who had a lotta kids who—
so even if I feel like he didn’t have dementia I might introduce myself every time, and he seems to remember 
M. Like he’ll—but me, I have to say, you know, I’m EM. It’s me. I always say, I’m your sister’s granddaughter or 
tell him about my mom. So, yeah, I guess I couldn’t say. He’s surprisingly, you know, there are those things 
that you’re always—I mean maybe not always, but you know, he remembers how to put on his clothes, those 
kinds of things. I might have to—because he’s older, he can’t stretch or move as much, so I might be doing 
more of taking down, but he knows what we’re doing. You know, he’s not so far. 
I: 
Okay. It must be a little bit different than taking care of your great aunt who you said was sharp, or your 
Grandma? 
P: 
Yeah. Yes. Yup. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Was sharp too. 
P: 
Yeah. It’s more—I wouldn’t say like a baby, but almost, you know, almost like that [51.46]. 
I: 
And tell me again how often—how many hours a week you go over? 
P: 
I usually go, like, every other week for 4 hours. 
I: 
And then Ma supplements what you’re doing? 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Right. So, that you need to be—and I know I think C has another caregiver. 
P: 
I mean Ma’s three, but I mean she’s there. Yeah. 
I: 
Oh, sorry. 
P: 
Yeah. My mom. Yeah, Mar. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18

I: 
Mar, right. So, could you talk just a little bit about your heritage? Your uncle is Mexican. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yes. 
I: 
Born in Mexico? 
P: 
I think they were born in Texas, but I’m not sure. Yeah. I’m not really sure. I know his parents are from 
Mexico, but I feel like the stories we always here they came from Texas. 
I: 
Okay. And how do you think that that has played into—you’re actually—I’m really happy to be doing this 
interview because you’re the first person that we’ve interviewed where you’re taking care of family. You’re 
getting paid. You’re a paid caregiver, but it’s family. Everybody else that we’ve talked to they’re taking care 
of— 
P: 
Strangers kind of? 
I: 
Not people who are family, so this is different. You know, you bring a different perspective, and some of 
it I wonder how much is related to your heritage? 
P: 
Mmm, mmm hmm. Well, my Grandma also took care of a little old man. Then my mom took—so, I don’t 
know if that’s something that is just from our family or [50.18] if it is from our heritage, but I just value old 
people so much [laughs]. I used to work in a restaurant for a long time, and the servers would be like, “Oh, you 
take them—” ‘cause they’re old. They’re like, “You love old people.” They would give me all the old people—
customers, and I don’t know it’s just—I never realized that I was taking them all, but you know, they’re like, Oh, 
E will do it, you know, because—” So, I don’t know if it’s culturally something that—but. 
I: 
It’s often said—I have a brother who lives in Mexico, is married to a Mexican woman, and her mother—
they’re helping to take care of her mother, and he’s always talking about the cultural differences— 
P: 
Uh-huh, yeah. 
I: 
--between how people in Mexico take care of family versus in the US. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
I don’t know if you see that? 
P: 
I guess it’s hard for me to say because the great aunt and uncle that I took care of are on my other 
side—my white side of my family, so I don’t know. I guess I just don’t know any different. I mean I feel like my 
dad’s cousins took really good care of them, and so to me I don’t really see a difference. I don’t know. I have 
some friends who might say, like, “I don’t know how you can do that.” You know, and I’m just thinking, like, 
well, what are they gonna do? They don’t do for themselves, so yeah. I guess I couldn’t really speak to the 
cultural difference ‘cause to me it just seems like automatic what you’re supposed to do [laughs]. 
I: 
Yeah. [Inaudible] it sounds like your mother really modeled that. 
P: 
Yeah. For sure, yeah. 
I: 
We have a wood chopper, apparently. [someone was cutting down a tree next door] 
P: 
[Laughing] yeah. 
I: 
[Laughing] so, what do you think is the most important thing that you do for your uncle? The care that 
you’re giving, how does that change his life? 
P: 
His life? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18

I: 
Aunt’s life? 
P: 
Well, what I like to do a lot is ask him questions about, you know, when he was a little boy or if he 
remembers, you know, like how his parents met or—and to me it seems like he is happy to talk about those 
things, so the things that I’m, [sobbing] sorry, just naturally curious about, and wanna know. You know, he 
helps me too because, you know, when he’s gone I won’t—who can I ask those things, you know? But—so I 
don’t know if I’m just helping him pass the time or—‘cause a lotta times it feels—I mean you’re saying that I’m 
doing good stuff, but I mean I feel guilty because it’s so good for me I don’t want to [cries] accept praise, 
because it’s—I don’t know, and my kids get a chance to meet him. They’ll never know his sister, but you know, 
they’ll know him. [Crying] sorry. 
I: 
So, don’t apologize. 
P: 
[Cry-laughing] 
I: 
Don’t apologize. You’re getting me— 
P: 
Sorry. So, sorry. 
I: 
We’re all gonna cry together. He’s gonna be crying in a moment. 
P: 
No, don’t. 
I: 
So, it sounds like you’re not only giving the physical care, helping him get up, get dressed, get 
breakfast, all of that stuff, but you’re also providing some companionship, and opportunity for him to talk about 
his life and stories. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And you feel that’s important as well. 
P: 
I think so. I mean it helps us pass our time together, too, and it’s, you know, I feel like he is happy—
yeah. He’s happy to talk about that, so. 
I: 
And then it’s also affecting the family, itself, like C. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
P: 
Yeah. C has a lot of—I mean she’s doing—I mean it’s amazing [46.24], especially when I think about 
that she has a lotta brothers—or brothers and sisters, and it’s like her, I feel like, most of everything with her 
dad. And she has a lot of—like even if she just wants to book us for more time and go out for longer it’s like 
she almost feels a little guilty about doing that. And I wanna help alleviate, you know, I don’t want her to feel 
guilty. I mean you can’t—you know, she’s doing a really good job, and she and her husband. You know, they’re 
giving up a lot of—they have two little grandkids that live in the area, and their time with them is, you know, 
they can’t just go take ‘em to the movies or together or anything, you know, because T cannot be there by 
himself, you know. So, it feels bad to say it’s a strain on them, you know, but it’s a pressure for sure. 
I: 
So, you’re helping her and her husband as much as you’re helping T. 
P: 
Yeah. I hope so. Yeah. 
I: 
It’s respite for her. 
P: 
Yeah.

I: 
Which kinda keeps the whole thing— 
P: 
Yeah. It can keep everything—yeah. 
I: 
Well, it makes it all somewhat possible. 
P: 
Yeah. Like my parents just went on a 5-day vacation, and my aunt came from Missouri to stay with my 
dad—my dad’s mom and stepdad. And I stopped by their late last night. My dad was showing me some 
pictures that they took, and I had my arm around him. No tension in his back. Nothing. You know, and it’s just 
they needed that. You know, they have constant—they also have older people that they’re taking care of, but 
anyway. Yeah. It’s so important for them to have a break [44.48]. 
I: 
And you know, this might not apply as much, but what would happen to this whole situation if you 
weren’t available? 
P: 
[Inaudible – whispering] I don’t know what. I mean I think that C would find more resources, but at first 
you know she just started with my mom coming I think one night a week. And then after a little bit, she’s like, 
“Well, maybe E can come too, you know.” Like she increasingly, you know, has more people coming. So, I’m 
glad that she’s like cognizant of the fact that she needs more, you know, support. 
I: 
And I think his status is changing too. I meant this is something— 
P: 
Ever changing, yeah. 
I: 
--right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
It’s not something that is going to stay the same. You can line up help, and then you count on it, and 
now everything’s good ‘cause— 
P: 
Right. There are falls or, yeah. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
--right? ‘Cause I know when I first met C they were—he was semi-independent. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And now, you can’t leave him alone. 
P: 
No. Mmp mmm. He has, like, an alarm on his bed that if he gets up it’s like mmm, mmm, mmm. 
[Laughing] you know, and P’s like running in there, but yeah [43.37]. 
I: 
So, what is the most rewarding thing about this job? 
P: 
I’m really happy that I can spend this time with him. That’s, you know, closer toward the end of his—
‘cause like I said there’s so many people in our family that when I was younger, you know, they’re just too 
many people. You can’t really get so—everybody has their own, like, little sections. Not that it was a click, but 
you know, he’s busy with his own grandkids, and his own—and now that we’re all sorta spread out and thinned 
out a little bit, you know, it’s really—I’m really happy that I can spend that time with him. 
I: 
And it sounds like it’s important for you, too, to have it for your children? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
The grandchildren to know him or the great— 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. Yeah 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18

I: 
[Inaudible – 42.53]. 
P: 
[Laughing] right. It gets— 
I: 
[Inaudible – laughter over] 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
What are the most challenging things about this work? 
P: 
I guess I really hate that I—I feel like sometimes I irritate him because I’m like—‘cause you know, a 
lotta times he might be reluctant to get dressed. You know, that’s exhausting for him even though he can still 
do it, it’s, you know, so maybe I—I don’t like that I have to feel like I’m pestering him so much, but yeah, I 
guess that’s—I mean sometimes I’m worried that he’ll fall or—but I stay, you know, right with him. But yeah, I 
guess that’s about it. I don’t wanna—you know, he’s an adult. I don’t wanna make him feel like a kid, you know, 
when I ask the same thing. I wanna make sure he, you know, still feels likes he’s in control, I guess. 
I: 
So, one of the things that we’re hearing from personal care workers who work in the home is that the 
big difference is that it’s one-on-one, and you get to know the person, and you sort of allow them to continue to 
be the person that they’ve always been. 
P: 
Mmm hmm.  
I: 
And sort of respect their individual preferences and needs and everything. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, do you do things with him that—that sort of respect his individual personality? 
P: 
Yeah. Like every—when I get him dressed, he always wants his watch, his wallet, you know, even 
though he doesn’t need his wallet, and you know, he doesn’t really need a watch, but—or his glasses. 
Everything—whatever he asks me for, you know, I’m just like, yup. Yes. You can, you know, why not, but yeah, 
and I usually try to ask him what does he want for breakfast? Does this sound good? Instead of just like, here it 
is! You know, eat this like I might with my kids [laughing], but with him, you know, I want him to indicate what 
he would like [40.58]. 
I: 
Can you think of some stories, if I came in and said, tell me a story about working with your uncle. 
P: 
With him? Yeah. My mom always has said that he was the fun uncle. You know, like he was the one 
who would get down and play with all the kids, and all the nieces and nephews and grandkids. So, he’s really 
funny with my daughter. It’s like every table place has a place mat on it, so if they’re eating he’s just like, 
“mmm,” trying to sneak the whole placemat. Youi know, just really jokey and fun for them, and their dad is like 
that too. So, you know, it’s just really—it’s really fun for them, and it’s nice that he’s still so playful, and even 
they’ll bring him their little baby dolls, and he just plays, you know, it’s—yeah. He can’t get up really and chase 
them, but he still—from his chair plays with them I feel like as much as he can. 
I: 
So, as you’re giving care, you know, can you—a particular instance come to mind that really was 
touching for you that illustrates everything you’re talking about in terms of what [inaudible]— 
P: 
With him—necessarily with him? I can’t think of a— 
I: 
No, other people too. 
P: 
Okay. Well, when I used to go take care of my aunt and uncle who were brother and sister, my mom 
came out once and brought [sobbing] like a hymn book, and they just—she would just start singing, and they, 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18 
6
you know, they remembered these songs from when they were really little, and I mean they sang their hearts 
out, and it was like—I mean it was just—it was adorable. That was one that, you know, I’ll remember [39.13], 
forever. But with T, let me think if I can think of one that’s really nice with him. Oh, he loves to sing and play the 
guitar, and a lotta times I’ll put Mexican music on. And he can identify, like, ‘cause you know it’s on Pandora or 
on my phone, and he’ll say, “Oh, this is blah, blah, blah,” and this song, and he knows all the songs, and I’ll 
look and he’s exactly right. And my girls really like music, and they’ll play with a lot of pretend guitars, but I’ll 
bring him his guitar, and sometimes he’s reluctant to play because I think, you know, he can tell that his, you 
know, he can’t play like he used to. But I took a video of him playing for the girls, and you know, it’s just nice to 
have these like worlds—not colliding, but you know, overlapping [sobbing] where they can see that part— 
I: 
[Inaudible]— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
To be able not just to have a still photograph but to hear his voice. 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. 
I: 
You’ve got the video. That’s wonderful. 
P: 
Sorry. 
I: 
Don’t worry about it [laughs]. So, can we ask just a little bit about the arrangements you’ve made with 
C? Do you have—you must have negotiated a pay-rate? 
P: 
Well, when I started my mom had already been—she’d already had my mom hired, so she just does 
exactly what she does for my mom. 
I: 
Okay. Can you give us some idea of what that is? 
P: 
Sure. She pays $25 an hour, which is so extreme [laughs] to me, and the first like three times—two or 
three times she forgot to pay me and I just kinda scooted out ‘cause I was like, well, I would rather just do this 
for, you know, maybe a fraction of that if not anything. But she specifically asked me like, “If I forget, you need 
to tell me.” But when I took care of my aunt and uncle, when it was just my aunt it was $10 an hour. And I 
mean I had two other jobs anyway at the [laughing] same time, so it wasn’t like I was, you know, it wasn’t my 
livelihood there. It was just an extra thing that I was doing, so, yeah [36.58]. But that was 11 years ago, too, so 
I don’t know if I was doing it now they would offer me more. I don’t really know. 
I: 
I think the average is still about $10 an hour. 
P: 
Yeah. Okay [laughs]. Yeah. 
I: 
You mentioned two other jobs. What other kind of work do you do? 
P: 
I was a server for a long time, so I worked in two different restaurants just kinda— 
I: 
Okay. And have you ever thought about doing personal care work for non-relatives? 
P: 
Yeah. I guess I, you know, people have suggested it to me, and the kind of people that are like, “I don’t 
know how you can do that. Like, maybe go work in a home or something,” but I don’t know. I guess if I run out 
of [laughing] family members, maybe I will, but we’ll see. I mean a lot of our neighbors around here are a lot 
older, and they might need more. There are people who—like the lady across the street, she married my 
husband and I. You know, they’re all people who have been here for a long time. So, I guess I could be 
available to them, but [laughs].

I: 
‘Cause it seems like you like it. 
P: 
Yeah,  For sure, yeah. 
I: 
And it’s not just because you’re related to these people? 
P: 
Yeah. No. 
I: 
You  like the work itself? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Is that right? 
P: 
Yeah. For sure. 
I: 
What is it you like about it? 
P: 
I guess I just like helping out [laughing] [35.37], you know, [for people] who can’t do for themselves. 
I: 
You must have some skills in this area that you do? 
P: 
[Laughing] I, yeah, I guess. I mean, yeah. I don’t know. Must be. 
I: 
‘Cause not everybody can do what you’re doing. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
Some people don’t have the skill or aren’t cut out for it. And, you know, one of the things I have learned 
over the years, is that personal care work—a lot of personal care workers started out by helping family— 
P: 
Oh. 
I: 
--you know, and then the family passes, and they decide that they wanna keep doing it with other 
people. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, you know, looking down the road, can you see that as a possibility? 
P: 
Yeah. Probably. Yeah. 
I: 
Do you have friends who do this kind of work? 
P: 
I worked with someone 10 years ago that she did that for a job, too, but I can’t remember—I wanna say 
it was her mother-in-law or somebody like that, but it was like through the state or something. But, no, not 
really [34.35]. 
I: 
So, I’m not sure how much you know about this work—just this whole workforce. There’s a really critical 
shortage of personal care workers right now. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
It’s actually sort of a desperate situation because the employers—homecare agencies—they just can’t 
find people. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then, the turnover is super high partly because of the wages. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18 
8
P: 
Oh. 
I: 
Being so low. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, the statistic that really sort of gets people’s attention is that it’s estimated that we’re gonna need 
about 32,000 more personal care workers in Michigan by 2020. 
P: 
Oh, uh-huh. 
I: 
That’s like a year and a half away. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
You know. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. How can you—yeah. 
I: 
How can you get 32,000 people—we’re not. 
P: 
Mmp mmm. 
I: 
And it’s gonna get worse as the baby boomers move along, you know. We’re getting old [group 
laughter], and so how do you encourage people to get into this field? What would you say to them if somebody 
was considering getting into this field, and they know they’re not gonna get paid a lotta money? But you know, 
there’s some down sides to it, but what are the upsides? 
P: 
I mean I think there’s a lot of, you know, like I’ve said, personal reward, you know, just like there have 
to be more people that [32.58] will feel good about helping people, you know. Yeah, I guess if it’s not paying 
very well, I mean, you’re gonna have to have two jobs, maybe [laughs], you know.  Yeah. I think that like I said 
the main thing that people when I talk about, you know, today this happened, especially with my aunt and 
uncle who I was with on a more regular basis. And they’re just like, “I don’t know how you do that, you know, 
when it comes to like bathroom or shower, things like that.” You can do it. It’s not, you know what I mean. 
Maybe you’re uncomfortable with your own body, but like, you know what I mean, it’s just a human body. Like, 
they need help, and, yeah, I just think maybe people don’t think that they, you know, can—but you can 
[laughs]. You know, it’s a lot easier than you think it is. 
I: 
You mean personal care, that might turn some people off? 
P: 
Yeah. Like helping someone go to the bathroom or give ‘em a shower. It’s like, you know, it’s just 
simply that. There’s no extra. It’s just that they—you know, it’s a basic human service that you’re providing, you 
know. 
I: 
So, those kinds of tasks you did with your aunt and uncle. 
P: 
Yeah. Yup. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And did you get any special training for that? Or did you just figure it out? 
P: 
No, I just—well, you know, my dad’s cousin would say, “This is what I do.” And then, so I just kinda go 
and see what was comfortable for them, and yeah, no real training [31.18]. 
I: 
So, somebody who had done it before was showing you what to do; how to do it? 
P: 
Yup.

I: 
Okay. And as T gets needing more and more help, are you just gonna stay? 
P: 
I hope—yeah, I hope so. Yeah. That’s my plan is to stay. 
I: 
Even if he ends up needing really sort of higher level care? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You’re comfortable doing that? 
P: 
Oh, sure. Yeah. Yup. Yeah. 
I: 
Okay. Talking to other people—sorry. He said we were outta time [group laughter] 
I2: 
We’re coming to a red light. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
I kinda forgot. Okay. We’re gonna pause. 
P: 
Okay [laughing]. 
I2: 
I was wondering. 
I: 
Yeah. It just occurred to me. It is different sort of talking about—I’ll keep talking even though he’s— 
P: 
Okay. Yeah. 
I: 
Taking care of family versus taking care of somebody who’s not family, I know a lot of the questions 
that, you know, I’ve been asking the other people really aren’t as good of a fit with you. 
P: 
I know. I feel like I’m answering them wrong. 
I: 
You’re doing great— 
P: 
Okay [laughing]. Like I feel like I’m— 
I2: 
Yeah. Use this next minute or so to just relax. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
But you’re doing great. 
I: 
Yeah you are. Did you wanna get a Kleenex or anything? 
P: 
Oh, no. I think I’ll be okay [29.48]. I’ll stop sniffling [laughing]. 
I: 
No. You really are doing well. Think, you know, while you’re relaxing— 
P: 
Sure. 
I: 
Think for a second about how do you—as a family member-  what’s your perspective of this line of 
work? You know, as a family member are there stories, you know, I did send you some sample questions— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--in advance to give you a heads up on things to think about, and as you were thinking about things, 
what came to mind that you wanted to share, but don’t answer just yet. 
P: 
Yeah. Okay. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18

I2: 
All right. I’m ready if you are ready. 
I: 
Okay. We’re gonna start up again, and I’ll just—and abbreviated version of what I just said. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, when you were thinking about this interview and what you wanted to say, tell me what came to 
mind? 
P: 
I guess I really was thinking—I don’t know that I feel like I—because it’s my family, it’s my duty. I really 
[sobbing] shouldn’t get paid. I feel funny about [sobs]—I just feel like everybody should help, and I guess I—I 
don’t know. I guess I just—I feel funny because it’s so good for me. I wouldn’t give up those experiences. Like 
a lotta my most hilarious stories about my aunt are from that time, and she was like a huge person with a huge 
personality, and for extra funny ones at the end is like, you know, just so—such a bonus for me. Like, once I 
went out there and you know, I’m pretty short [27.56], and I used to wear these boots that had a really high 
heel, and I walked in the door and her daughter-in-law is like, “Oh, those C’s they just—they always wanna be 
taller than they are. And my aunt, who is, you know, in her 80s is like, “Oh, I used to have boots like that. She’s 
shorter than I am, you know. At this time, she could still walk with ease, and I’m talking to her daughter-in-law 
and she comes in the kitchen, teetering on these like stiletto heels that she has found that are like this [high – 
she showed with her fingers – about 5”], and she’s like all happy [laughing], you know, and her daughter-in-law 
is like where did you find those? You know, she dug ‘em out of some closet, and you know, at 80-plus years 
old on these like heels. It was, you know, just funny [laughing]. 
I: 
That’s a great story. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. She was really funny. 
I: 
And, hopefully, she didn’t like fall or anything— 
P: 
No, not at all [laughing]. Uh-huh, not at all. 
I: 
Can you think of another hilarious story? 
P: 
Well. I was, you know, dating somebody at the time, and we’re standing at the stove, and I’m making 
her lunch. He was gonna come to town. He was from Ann Arbor, and I’m telling her, oh, this is exciting. You 
know, we’re just—I’m cooking, and she was just standing next to me [26.48] and we’re talking. I’m like I’m 
really excited, you know, he’s coming to town tonight. And she’s like all jealous, like, “Well, if you’re so excited, 
maybe you should just go home now.” [Laughing] just like a little bit like, pay attention to me [laughing]. And 
that’s how her mom was too, you know, just a little bit like—a little, tiny brattiness you know, but it was hilarious 
to me. And another time when she could still—when I first started going out there, we stood at the kitchen sink, 
and we were just talking, and she was unwrapping candies and just passing me one, and we’re looking out the 
window just talking, talking, and it was just, you know, it was just funny. Like here we go, me and my little, tiny 
[laughing] just talkin’ about boys [laughing]. Yeah. 
I: 
So, those are moments to treasure. 
P: 
Yeah. For sure. Another story that I thought about, which is not related to T, but, I guess most of my 
stories are about my aunt and uncle because I have already spent more time with them. I’ll probably have 
maybe in a year more with T, but she was gonna be moved to a nursing home, and they weren’t [sobbing] 
telling her, and they weren’t telling her brother, who we were also taking care of, and so I knew it was gonna be 
like our last day together, so I brought stuff for like banana splits and chili dogs and stuff like that so we could 
have like a little party, sorry, I’m touching my face, and it was just hard to—I couldn’t say why we were having a 
little good-bye party, and you know [sobbing], it’s the last time they ever saw each other, you know, so that was 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18 
11
hard, you know, [25.11] and that’s the hard part. That you can’t—I mean I could have told them I guess, but it 
wasn’t really my place to tell them that.  
I: 
So, the decision was made that she would go to a nursing home? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
She needed more care than— 
P: 
She just couldn’t really walk anymore, so they had a hard time getting her to get outta bed. I mean she 
could—she talked to us. She had Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. I mean she talked to us and everything, but it 
just—they just couldn’t provide enough—there’s no way that they could carry her to a shower, and you know, 
all those types of things [24.32]. 
I: 
So, do you feel comfortable sharing sort of the ending of that story? How did that turn out? 
P: 
Oh, sure. Well, so she went into the nursing home, and you know, I had been seeing her for I think 2 
years three times a week, and so when I first went when they put her in, I hurried to her room, you know, and 
she’s just like, “Where have you been?” You know, [sobbing] she was really like, “Why did you leave me?” You 
know, like what is this, you know? And as a family we’d go up there, I’d try to go about once a week, and then 
it’s like—it was less and less. They were maybe 25 minutes away from here—she was—and we’d stop by. I 
tried to stop by with my kids, and then a lotta times there was like flu, and they didn’t—we’d get all the way 
there, and they were like, “Please don’t, you know, please don’t come in. We don’t want it going in and out.” 
There was too much illness, but the last time I saw her was—I was pregnant with Ma, so it was about 4 years 
ago, and we had already planned to give Ma her middle name [sobbing] or Mari for her middle name. And so, I 
told her about the baby, and my oldest was 2, and she got down and rubbed Aunt Mary’s feet and stuff. You 
know, Aunt Mari didn’t really—you couldn’t see that she even really knew that we were there, you know, but I 
just talk anyway, like, in hopes that they do hear me. But when I held the baby, A, who was 2 to her, like can 
you give Aunt Mari a kiss. I’m like Aunt Mari here’s the baby, and she just gave her—I have a really good 
picture where Aunt Mari’s givin’ her a kiss, and it’s like, you know, brought her a little bit back. But she passed 
away 2 days before Ma was born [sobbing], so I didn’t go to the funeral. I couldn’t go to the funeral or anything. 
I was still in the hospital, but yeah, sorry. 
I: 
Don’t be sorry. 
P: 
Yeah. I was, and her brother had passed away—the other one that I was taking care of—he passed 
away just in his sleep. He was the baby brother, but they think he just had a heart attack, and so he passed 
away before Aunt Mari did. So, I had already completely stopped going out to that house anyway to take care 
of anybody [22.04]. 
I: 
And how long was she in the nursing home? 
P: 
I wanna say she was there for at least 5 years I think, yeah. 
I: 
Okay. So, she lived quite a while after moving. 
P: 
Yeah, but it was, you know, you’d go, and she was just, kinda like staring, and you know. Once in a 
while, but they have little tiny rooms, and we’d all just like jam in there [laughs/cries]. And my husband—but he 
was just my boyfriend then, they’re like, “Hey, you gotta meet E’s new boyfriend, you know.” So, he’s, like, 
pushed to the front of this like—you know, the room is like this big, and so she’s like, “Come here.” And he’s 
like—she’s like, “Run.” Like just being funny, like run away [laughing], but she was really hil— 
I: 
[Inaudible]— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18 
12
P: 
Just being funny, yeah, like run away [laughing]. So, I’m glad that he, you know, got to meet her and 
have at least a few experiences with her, too, but yeah. 
I: 
So, some of the questions that I sent you were more about this line of work in a bigger context. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
I think before we started here, we were talking about how we need to somehow get more personal care 
workers into the field, and treat ‘em right, and get that message across to people. I think it’s hard partly 
because people don’t understand what a personal care worker does. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Would you agree with that? 
P: 
Yeah. I think so. I think they think it’s all just like changing diapers, and you know, they only think of the 
things that they wouldn’t wanna do, I think. You know, and it’s so much more [20.25]. 
I: 
You know, we’ve heard that line so many times now.  
P: 
Oh, really? 
I: 
It’s so much more. I mean that should be the title [inaudible]— 
P: 
[Laughing] yeah. 
I: 
It’s so much more because I think people just think about the physical care that you’re providing, and 
with helping with the body and don’t seem to count or value the day-to-day stuff like the cooking, the cleaning. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
You know, getting breakfast. Although, I don’t know what we would do if we couldn’t cook and clean. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
What would we do? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
What would you do? 
P: 
Yeah. You couldn’t. You just— 
I: 
You couldn’t live here. 
P: 
Mmp mmm, nope. 
I: 
So, I don’t think they think about those tasks, but really, I don’t think people are thinking about the 
emotional and spiritual things like companionship that you provide. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
Sort of negotiating all of that. Can you talk just a minute about that? 
P: 
Yeah. I feel like the smallest part is the helping him change his clothes and those kind of things. It’s like 
that’s just the tiniest part of it, you know, and [19.13] I guess especially like I think for me I love to—I wanna 
hear everything about you. I wanna hear everything about you, so every person—it’s so important to hear 
everybody’s—what he has to offer. Do you know what I mean, out ways [laughing]? I mean I not uncomfortable 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18 
13
bathing or changing someone, but I feel like that’s gonna be what you’re gonna get from it more. You know, the 
life experience of someone else, and those other things are—yes, they’re completely necessary, but it’s the 
tiniest part of your job. 
I: 
It’s so much more. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
And you’re comfortable bathing him, but is he comfortable with you bathing him? 
P: 
Well, so far, I haven’t had to do a full shower. I just help him—I wet a washcloth, and put soap, and 
then he kinda does it. He seems okay. You know, at first, I asked C, you know, is he gonna be okay [18.14] 
with me? ‘Cause I’m fine, but I don’t want him to—and she’s like, “Oh, [makes a noise]. He’s fine.” I usually try 
to keep Ma out, my 3-year-old, just in case he’s like, “Hey, what’s this kid doin’ in here,” you know? And also, 
to give him his privacy, you know. I give him a towel to put across his lap if he wants it, but he seems fine. 
There are times when he doesn’t think he needs his underpants changed. He wears like a depends, you know. 
And sometimes—it will need to be changed, and I don’t know if that’s him feeling uncomfortable, and he’s like, 
“Oh, no. It’s fine.” You know, I don’t know if that’s his way of saying, please don’t do that, but I’m still gonna, 
you know, do it. So, he’s never outwardly said, “No. I don’t want to,” or ‘Please don’t do that.” You know, he’s 
usually like, “Well, maybe not right now.” And I’m just like, well, right now [laughing]. But he has never indicated 
that he’s uncomfortable or outright said, “Please don’t,” or “I would rather you wouldn’t,” or anything like that. 
I: 
And what about with your uncle? Your other—I  mean you’re— 
P: 
Nope. I don’t know. I feel like I’ve had such an easy experience where everybody was just kinda like, 
“Okay.” You know, this is just very matter of fact of what needs to be done, and we’re doing it, and it’s not 
gonna be a big—when you talk to my mom, you’ll have a [laughs] way different story with my Grandma, but 
[laughs] that hasn’t been my experience. I’ve luckily haven’t had to have any like bathing arguments or, 
[laughing] you know, nobody’s combative with me or anything [16.36]. 
I: 
So, I think wrapped up in that, it’s so much more, is it’s, again, it doesn’t come down just to a physical 
task, it’s you know, protecting their dignity. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Making sure that they have privacy. It’s all these things that are really important that we show out of 
respect for somebody. 
P: 
Yes. I don’t want him to lose his—because he has a very—I don’t wanna say strong personality 
because that sounds like he’s—but he, you know, has a really strong sense of himself, and I would never want 
him to, you know, feel like we’re patronizing him or babying him or something. You know, I want him to have all 
his—everything that he can have [laughs], you know, for himself. 
I: 
So, part of it is educating people. I think people don’t have a good idea of the kind of work that you’re 
doing, but also part of it is changing the social value or the value we place on personal care workers. I don’t 
think society places a lot of value on the work that you do. Would you agree with that? 
P: 
I mean I couldn’t really say. I don’t have, you know, coworkers that do the same thing, so I will say, like, 
in the restaurant when nobody wanted to wait on the old people, and it was only me. Like, that’s probably 
indicative of how people feel about old people, but for me I’m like—and maybe I shouldn’t be saying old people 
a thousand times, but elderly people, I don’t know. I just wanna—I have a higher respect, and maybe from 
growing up with my Grandma here, and [14.54] [sobbing], you know, those are the people that are important to 
me—old people [laugh/cries]. So, I don’t know I guess—I don’t know. I don’t know. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18

I: 
So, what would you say, you know, I think your story is very powerful, and it—I hope that it moves 
policymakers, and what you—if you had the opportunity if the president was sitting here or— 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
--the Governor or someone instead of me, what would you say about--? 
P: 
Well, I guess I’d probably say—and I mean and it’s not only old people that you’re referring to ‘cause 
I’m sure that there are people who take care of—but you’re gonna get old someday. That’s what I would say to 
them. You know, like don’t you want the same dignity and respect and help, let alone, you know, all those other 
things. I guess that’s what I would say. Like, you’re gonna get your turn too. You know, [laughing] so you know, 
if you can’t think of other people, at least think of yourself [13.49]. 
I: 
And what would you want them to do? If, let’s say they do start thinking, “Oh, yeah, right. I’m gonna get 
old someday.” 
P: 
Right. Well— 
I: 
“Now, what do I do?” 
P: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
I: 
“What should I do to help this situation?” 
P: 
Well, I mean I grew up going to nursing homes. I was in a little group that we’d go and sing songs and 
take Christmas presents and things like that. Like, that’d probably be a start to normalize, you know, interacting 
with older people. Like, you know, if you aren’t taught to value—I mean you have to be taught to value these 
people. So, I guess that would probably be a start. Spend more time with older people, you know. 
I: 
So, that’s really good advice. So, you would tell the president— 
P: 
[Laughs] 
I: 
--you should maybe go to a nursing home and see, and get to [laughing] know the people— 
P: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
I: 
Well, what regulatory or legislative changes do you think they could make? 
P: 
I really—I really don’t know. I mean [12.50] you could, sorry [laughs], I’m thinking. 
I: 
You go ahead and think. 
P: 
I don’t know what you could do. I mean I guess make a certain wage for—you know, there has to be 
something that’s gonna make it more beneficial to the people doing the work. You know, more desirable, but I 
wouldn’t even know what to. 
I: 
So, wages? 
P: 
Yeah. I would say wages for sure. Yeah. Mmm hmm. Yeah. 
I: 
Okay. Did I miss anything? You know, the scenario stories that you wanted to share that you haven’t 
had any chance to? 
P: 
No. I think I cried enough. No [laughs]. I think that’s everything. 
I: 
So, any final words? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18 
15
P: 
Sorry, I cried so much. No. I just wish people would, you know, learn to value older people. I mean it’s 
sad to me. Even if you’re not related. I mean I know I have a bias [laughs], but yeah. But I don’t know how you 
would [11.29]—I don’t know how you would change that. 
I: 
I hope someday, if you want to, you’re doin’ it for other people too. 
P: 
Yeah [laugh]. 
I: 
‘Cause you clearly are passionate about it. 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
You know, I think like it. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And you’re good at it, so. I don’t have any other questions, do you? 
I2: 
Thank you very much. Yeah. 
P: 
Sorry. 
I2: 
No. Don’t be sorry. No, we appreciate that you’re able to kinda like dig a little deeper, you know. And 
you have all these personal connections to people you’re taking care of. That is rare at least for our sample of 
people we’ve talked to. 
I: 
Yeah, and it is a different perspective, and actually the tears and the emotion— 
P: 
I’m sorry. It’s embarrassing [laughs]. 
I: 
No. Please don’t be embarrassed ‘cause that’s—I think it’s really rich, and it shows, you know, that 
there’s real emotional connection here, and that drives you. It’s not about the money. It’s about— 
P: 
Yeah. I wouldn’t—I’m so happy, you know, that I have those times. I feel bad. My brother, he doesn’t do 
anything like that, and I’m just like I feel, you know, I just feel bad for him that he’s missing out on, you know, I 
don’t know. 
I: 
I feel the same way about my dad. I think those last 2 years were such a gift, and— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--he really helped me as much as I was helping him, and I’m grateful I had that time, and I know my 
siblings didn’t. They couldn’t. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
But I did, and I’m really so grateful. 
P: 
Yeah. I hope C—I mean I know she’s really grateful I just feel like it has to be hard when there’s so 
many brothers and sisters. You know what I mean? And it’s like, I don’t know, but everybody—the best thing is 
that they’re catching me at a good time, you know what I mean? It’s timing I’m sure [9.40]. 
I: 
Yeah. 
P: 
You know, I was more available. 
I: 
Yeah. Well, C told me that, “Once you interview her, you’re gonna see how lucky I am— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Eva M.Sharpe 6.10.18 
16
P: 
[Laughing] 
I; 
--to have her helping me.” 
P: 
She’s so sweet [laughing]. She’s so sweet. 
I: 
And she was right. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I2: 
I know this is like a hypothetical question, but you know, a lot of your experiences are tied to what you 
just did. You were expected to kind of do it, you know, you did it as a younger person. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
How much of what you know about caretaking is from just family knowledge or from what you’ve 
learned from an external source? 
P: 
Oh. 
I2: 
Because a lotta people don’t have the experiences you have of, you know, just family taking care of 
each other. 
P: 
Right. 
I2: 
Can you give us some comments on that? 
P: 
Sure. I have never had really any training [8.47] to do anything. I think a lot of my stuff is just instinctual, 
which makes me feel like I’m bragging, but [laughs] really, like, sometimes T will say. “I have to go to work 
today. I gotta get up and go to work.” And I’ll just say, “Oh, where do you work?” You know, I don’t—and you 
know, I mention when those things—when he kinda goes in that wandering world to C, and she’s like “That’s 
exactly what you’re supposed to do. You just livin’ in that with them.” And I’m like, oh, see, I don’t know that I’m 
just like doing it. So, I think it’s just from—like spending the time in the nursing home, you know, people will 
think that you’re somebody else, and I just would just play along because I’m not gonna, you know, correct 
them for what? You know, if they’re enjoying that, then, yeah. So, I think it’s just from taking care of people, 
and just the experience of taking care of them. You know, nothing really outside. C gave me a book to read, 
but I think I keep rereading the same first 29 pages. I’m like, okay, well, I gotta get back in this, and then I’m 
like—so, I haven’t delved into it too much, but. 
I: 
So, a follow-up question, would you like to have more training? 
P: 
Um— 
I: 
Would that interest you? 
P: 
Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Because there are aspects where, you know, I’d be nervous to know if there really 
was a medical emergency, like, yeah, I can call 911. And if he hits his head, I’ll apply pressure to the—you 
know what I mean? But as far as anything more serious, you know, I really wouldn’t, you know, I don’t have 
any training to know what exactly to look for or do. 
I2: 
Can you think of a time where you were like nervous. You were like I don’t know how to handle this? 
P: 
Well, a few weeks ago C was there kinda fiddling around the house, and I was just about to leave, and 
T had fallen 2 days before when Cl, C’s husband was there, and hit his head. He had like a pretty good gash. 
He’s spent time in the hospital, but had been sent home [6.41], so he was sitting up and he started like lurching 
like this. And I don’t know if maybe I should have felt nervous, but I just instantly was like, C, can you come in

here. And I guess I didn’t have time to be nervous because I wanna be stronger for her. She was very nervous. 
I mean he was just like lurching and lurching, and it’s like there are probably times when I should be nervous, 
but I don’t want to. And maybe a tiny part of me is, but I wanna be calm for—I mean that’s how I am with my 
kids too, and my husband because if something happens with the kids he’s like, you know, and I wanna be—
even if there’s this tiny part, it just is squashed because I don’t want him to be nervous or her to be nervous. 
So, I probably should have been [laughs] nervous, but I just wasn’t. 
I: 
And what would you have done if C hadn’t been there? 
P: 
I probably would have instantly either called her or 911. She waited a little bit to call. Not a long time at 
all. It was probably 2 minutes, but you know, when you’re in that if feels a little bit—and, you know, she’s like, 
“Oh, I shoulda called right away.” And I’m like, no, I mean it was only 2 minutes, and you don’t really know 
what’s happening, you know. But if C wasn’t there, I would probably would have because it was nothing I had 
ever seen before, and I knew he had recently hit his head, so to me it looked like he was on like a boat and 
was dizzy. So, I’m like I’ve never seen that, so I probably would have just called, you know, and 911 could 
probably tell me, you know, if it was necessary for somebody to come out or, yeah. 
I: 
How did that play out? How did that story end? 
P: 
He—the ambulance came, and they ended up taking him in. You know, you can’t really answer 
questions like who is the president or, you know, the things that they would ask to ascertain, you know, if he 
was having an issue, but they did end up taking him in. He was very weak, like, he could hardly even walk. 
They have like a little stretcher that’s a seat, and he could barely walk to that. So, they ended up taking him in, 
and I think he was at the hospital 2 days, and they checked him all out, and they really couldn’t explain what 
had happened. So, he just—it might just be symptom of what—but to me, you know, it looked like he was dizzy 
with the way he was like bracing himself almost and rocking, but I don’t think there’s been incidents since then. 
And so, yeah, so he just went and had a few-day hospital stay. 
I: 
I just he just flashed us the card again. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
And I’m not sure, so we’ll pause, but I’m not sure I have a whole lot more questions. Thank you for 
asking that question, K. 
I2: 
I can—if we’re gonna do a short little good-bye ending thing, then I can just keep it going. 
I: 
Okay. What - so 5 minutes? 
I2: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, a  little bonus. 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
Yes, I guess my last question was, you know, if you wanted some additional training, even if you don’t 
go on to do this kind of work for other people, but there’s—I’ve mentioned that comprehensive PCA training. 
That’s actually 77 hours of training. 
P: 
Oh, wow. 
I: 
It covers all the basics, some of the technical skills, but also how do you do these skills in a person-
centered way, so that you’re protecting dignity and things like that. 
P: 
Mmm hmm.

I: 
But then there are other shorter sessions that are just on understanding dementia, and the different 
kinds of dementia, and how do you, you know, in this situation or that situation—then there’s one about home 
skills. The huge difference between a CNA program and a PCA program is it has that whole home component. 
So, you know, do those kinds of things—do you feel the need for it or just you would— 
P: 
I mean I feel like it would be—it would probably enhance what I can do there, but I don’t know so far, 
I’m probably like tomorrow when I go I’ll have something that tests me, but so far, it’s been pretty smooth 
sailing, you know. But there wouldn’t be any harm in doing, you know, there’s no negative for learning more 
and adding to— 
I: 
And, again, your situation’s a little different, but for people who are doing this for pay and, you know, 
maybe wanna make a career out of it, they’re gonna face all kinds of different situations, and probably some 
people that don’t love them so much— 
P: 
Right [laughs]. 
I: 
What would you think training would be important for them? 
P: 
Yeah. Because for people who are taking care of the ones that they don’t, yeah—yeah, because I think 
they could probably almost be desensitized to the person’s feelings, and just almost look at it like a job, you 
know. And, yeah, I think it would help to, you know, add that extra dimension of care. Not just because it’s your 
job and because you don’t, you know, you don’t want ‘em to hurt themselves or something. You know, but to 
see them more as a person. 
I: 
So, you would think the important part of the training would be how do you work with these people— 
P: 
Yeah. And humanize them. You know, since they’re humans [laughs]. Yeah. 
I: 
That’s good. K, do you have any thoughts? 
I2: 
No, Thank you. 
I: 
You? Anything? 
P: 
I don’t think so. 
I: 
Anything you wanna add? 
P: 
No. Thank you for asking me [laughing]. 
I: 
Well, thank you so much, and again, thank you for doing what you’re doing because you make it 
possible for your family members to stay at home. You know, they do need help. C does need help, and I don’t 
know what she would do. The work that you’re doing is really important. So, thank you for doing that, and thank 
you for this interview. 
P: 
Thank you [laughs]. 
I: 
So, we’re gonna stop here? 
I2: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And I’m gonna clear out and let him do his thing. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
He’s gonna take some portrait shots.

P: 
Oh, okay. 
I: 
And then once we have released some of this material to, you know, the exhibit I told you about— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
And stuff like that, then you’ll be able to get copies of these photos. 
P: 
Oh, okay [laughs]. 
I: 
This is really nice since he’s such a good [inaudible]— 
P: 
[Laughing] yeah. 
I: 
So, I’ll turn these off now, and while you’re working with him I’m gonna get your gift card ready. 
P: 
Oh, okay. 
I: 
Then we’ll be done.
