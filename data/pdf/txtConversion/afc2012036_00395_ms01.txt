Briana O’Higgins interviewing Mayor Carl Brewer, it is November 16, 2012 
 
Will you say your name and what you do? 
 
I am, uh, my name is Carl Brewer and I am the mayor of the city of Wichita. 
 
How old are you? 
 
I am 55 years old. 
 
Are you from Wichita? 
 
Yes, born and raised here. 
 
Um, when you were growing up do you remember what you knew or thought of 
Boeing? 
 
Well growing up you always knew of the Boeing Company. I mean during that time 
frame there was primarily, you know the aviation industry and meatpacking. Um, 
back during that time in the 60s. So, uh, so you always knew, you know, one of 
those particular industries, but you always knew somebody that worked at one of 
those two industries and everyone knew that everyone worked at Boeing was paid a 
lot of money. Hahha. At least that was the way that individuals looked at it. It paid 
well.  
 
Did you have family members that worked at Boeing? 
 
My stepfather did. My stepfather worked there, and uh, I think the rest of my family 
worked in the meat packing industry,  
 
Do you remember what you thought about your step father’s work at Boeing? What 
he felt about his work there? 
 
You know at that age I really don’t know whether he talked about it at all or I just 
didn’t pay attention, I don’t know. HAHA during that time.  
 
When did you start working at Boeing? 
 
I started working for Boeing, actually it was um, March 22, 1985. I only remember 
that because I was laid off from Cessna on March 21, 1985, and immediately the 
following day I started working for them. 
 
Will you talk about what led you up to the aircraft industry; was Cessna your first 
job? What did you do prior to that? 
 
Before that I started out uh, right out of high school I worked in the meat, the meat 
packing industry and uh, and then I eventually, you know, ended up changing fields 
from there, and ended up getting a job for Cessna and uh, and in tube forming, and 
later I went on to the military and when I came back I ended up working for Cessna 
Wallace building stub wings for the 400 line, 425, 400 and that nature. Then later 
went on to college and uh, Cessna gave me an internship uh, as an engineer, so I 
ended up being a sheet metal mechanic, then an inspector and for Cessna for the 
650 line, then ended up being an engineering intern for design and back during that 
time in the 1980s was when we had the big recession, and a lot of individuals ended 
up getting laid off and Cessna ended up shutting down their Pawnee plant and 
things of that nature, so from that standpoint I ended getting laid off. But fortunately 
uh, Boeing picked me up as an intern working for them, and uh, so I went over and I 
worked for Dawn on the modification side, and I did the KC 135 refueler and the F4 
fighters and things of that nature. And then eventually I think the last thing that I 
worked on on the military side was uh, when we ended up receiving the contract to 
build Air Force One, which are the ones that the president is flying on now. And so, 
uh, I had a opportunity to do some planning and also some design on the on the 
installation for the stringers and things of that nature that held the brackets, actually 
they were brackets, and held the wiring and things of that nature in place. and then 
from that standpoint, after that i went on to started working for the commercial side 
and I, we were just getting involved in cateea (?) and things of that nature, and they 
were just getting involved, they wanted to do uh, 777 in a continued format, but they, 
at that point in time engineers primarily did CAD scan and things of that nature so 
they send everyone through this crash course. It was an interesting one because 
everyone had something on the line because they gave us six weeks and you had to 
be able to, within the six week timeframe, you had to be able to build wireframes, 
design wireframes and then build solids and then coordinate and build assembly 
parts in Cateea. And the agreement was that if you passed it then you had a job. If 
you didn’t then you didn’t have a job. 
 
Was that a digital training? 
 
Yes. Yes, it’s the newest version of CAD Can, the way they design parts and things 
of that nature using the computer system. And so that is still what they use now and 
all engineers must have that nowadays, so of course we went through that extensive 
crash course that normally would take you a year to learn it, you know. We got six 
weeks to learn it, and fortunately I did it and took the exam and, and uh, kept my job. 
So I ended up working for them, and working 777. Then I became a manager on the 
floor, an operations manager for 737 and uh, did that, and then I closed out the, the 
old 737 line, I was one of the last three managers to leave, to walk away. And uh, 
sell off all the equipment and the tooling and things of that nature, and say OK, this 
is our last one, we are not doing anymore. And then we went over and we built the 
737 new generation. Which is the classic that they built today, which is the largest 
selling aircraft that Boeing has today, and so that was that was very exciting to start 
a new program of that nature, and state of the art everything. Totally different 
concepts, and so after completing that um, I worked there for I think a couple years 
and eventually I went on and became a lean manager for that particular line, and 
um, was in charge of lean manufacturing for 737 line, and figuring out how to do 
things more cost effectively, but also do them in a manner that, not only cost 
effectively, but what we could use fewer people, improve the quality, and with uh, 
save cost and reduce the number of errors and things of that nature, so I managed 
to uh, a team to be able to do that and following that then I was, was asked about 
going to do 787, and working with a team to design, this would be the first plane that 
we had ever done that was made of composites, and uh, so we designed the plane 
and we come up with… you know after several different illustrations of the plane 
itself, and at that time it was 7E7, and uh, once it was designed the plane, they tried 
to figure out how this plane would actually be built, and the engineering we 
determined when engineering had to be completed, and when tools had to be 
completed, so we come up with a flow as to even with the extent of purchasing 
material and parts, rather than just purchasing both (bolt?). We used a lot of the lean 
concepts, and it was just in time, as we needed things, you know, then we would 
make those investments. So, as we started doing those types of things, then we 
figured the day that we had to deliver on then, um, myself and my team we would 
design this, put it all together and then we would report. And for any time maybe 
engineering would be slow or material wouldn’t come in then we had to report, what 
is the impact going to be down the line. Who is it going to effect? So everyone knew 
what was going on and had their hand on the pulse of this entire project. Not uh, 
unfortunately it ended up being built and, and at the time that we finished the first 
prototype was at the point in time that I was elected mayor. Before that you know, I 
was actually a city council member and managed the program and was a city council 
member at the same time for district 1.  
 
I am not from here, so let me clarify that you were on city council and continued to 
work at Boeing?  
 
Yes. 
 
And you ran for mayor when you were currently employed at Boeing? 
 
That’s – I was currently employed at Spirit Aerosystems, you know they went 
through a process approximately 8 years ago where Onyx actually purchased the 
commercial side of Boeing, and so when people refer to Spirit Aerosystems they 
always say Boeing/Spirit Aerosystems just so they can make that connection. 
 
So you went with Spirit when they sold the commercial side? 
 
Because I was working on 787 um, one of the things that they did is said you don’t 
get a choice to stay with Boeing, you have to go with the program, and so you know, 
and oh by the way you can go back to work for Boeing for two years, but uh, you 
know it was something that was exciting for me to do, new project, new programs, 
state of the art, something different that we had never… and that was the thing that 
was going to take is beyond, and certainly it definitely did that. 
 
Where did you get your college degree? I just want to step back a second. Did you 
finish college? You said you went to… 
 
I had one more year left, and I was busy working and I said OK, I’m not going to be 
able to work this number of hours and go to college at the same time, uh, so I was 
like a year short of finishing. 
 
But you did come out of the engineering department to move up in Boeing? 
 
Yes, exactly.  
 
And then you went to spirit, OK. 
 
So at that point in time I was working, at the time we started building 787 is when the 
sale actually happened and Onyx purchased Boeing and they named it Spirit 
Aerosystems, which is what it remains today. 
 
How was the split for you, were you disappointed at all to leave Boeing and go 
there? And then were there changes in your employment, benefits, anything? 
 
Quite naturally you always have those concerns. How is this going to affect me? But 
then when you start looking at it from another perspective, that thank God I have a 
job, its not that bad. But you know, actually, uh, the sell actually was something that, 
actually ended up coming out better, and uh, yeah it actually ended up coming out 
better because the sell allowed the company to start diversifying so what we have 
always known about the Boeing company, that we could do more things uh, with the 
skilled workforce, and the dynamics on the side. That we could do work for other 
aviation companies, we could do work for other industries, Spirit was given that 
freedom for them to do that. and uh, you know, so that was something that ended up 
coming out of it. And uh, and benefits, nothing ever changed. And everyone was 
extremely happy after they made the changes and things of that nature. And uh, I 
will say that they came up with a bonus program when the company made money, 
then you would get a bonus check. 
 
Were you sad to leave aviation when you became mayor? 
 
Actually I was working 787 and currently, I am on a leave of absence from Spirit 
Aerosystems. 
 
Really? 
 
Yes. 
 
How long have you been mayor? 
 
This coming April it will be six years. 
 
Six years. So would you consider going back? 
 
Of course, it’s a wonderful company to work for. And you know, and I had a lot of 
friends. Of course in six years a lot of things have changed out there. But, you know 
I am still in contact with the company. I deal with them, just like I do all my other 
aviation companies, and uh, but yes, part of, when I decided that I wanted to run for 
mayor I did meet with the, Jeff Turner and Ron Bronton and said this is what I am 
looking at doing and I know that we are going into a recession and, I mean, just 
cycling we knew this. Now did I know that it was going to be the worst recession in 
our history? No I didn’t know that. but um, I said I think that we need to be there, and 
I need to be there because I understand aviation and I need to put things in place to 
be able to protect the aviation industry, which is the primary industry we have here. 
And Wichita, and our region and the state of Kansas. And so, you know, so they 
approved me and said OK, if this is what you want to do, they’d never had anyone 
who had ever did it, and they told me that we support you and you know, if you win, 
we will give you a leave of absence and when you finish, when you finish being 
mayor, then you can come back. And um, we will have a position. So they have held 
true to that, in fact every time I see Jeff he says, now remember, we have a place 
here for you. HAHAHAHA. But uh, you know, I had no idea that the recession was 
going to be that tough, and it was, it was a grueling battle, but fortunately enough, 
you know, I knew that aviation was the number one export in the state of Kansas, in 
the nation, and it was important that we sell planes, and it was my job to sell all the 
aircraft, and whether it be large commercial, like you see the Boeing Company or 
whether it be just business jets, just our general aviation, and so as I started 
expanding the role of the mayor, where the mayor has to go out and has to market 
not only their city, but what are their products, what do we have you know, you are 
almost like a salesmen in trying to sell what we actually have and get individuals to 
invest and buy our product. 
 
And you think your background really helped you do that? Helps you do that. 
 
It did I really think it did. Because as I am talking to other countries about what we 
actually have I understood it because I come from that environment and I work there, 
and of course the other portion was you know, I haven’t had… general aviation knew 
that I had this background so they say, Carl whatever you need, just tell us whatever 
it is you need. And many of them, in fact all of them, whenever I needed any help or 
if I needed information or I needed support they supported me. God I would have to 
say 150 percent. 
 
What role did Boeing, and specifically the Boeing Company play in making Wichita 
the aviation capital of the country? 
 
Oh my God. You can’t go anyplace without talking about the Boeing company, I 
mean, we’re talking about Boeing, largest employer at one point in time here in the 
city of Wichita. They built… you can start with, they started out with the 707s, the 
737s, the 757s, the 747s, and the 777s, and then the 787, I mean, its easy when you 
talk about Boeing, and you start talking about the city of Wichita, everyone knows 
that Boeing was here. You have their name, that is like having Apple or something 
like that, or one of those major headquarters located in your city, and they are the 
largest employer and every single day we have, we have, uh, flat rails leaving here 
with fuselages on the rails, sometimes 10, 15 20 of the at a time. They are leaving 
here with Boeing on the side of them, I mean, how could you not think that we are 
the air capital of the world? I mean they played a major role, and they were here 
even from the early wars, uh, when you started, when many of the men went off 
during WW I and WWII, men went off to war and the women went there and they 
built the bombers, and everyone knew that you know, bombers were built right here 
in the city of Wichita. Russia knew that the bombers were built here. I mean when 
they, when we were having the Cold War and they were saying identifying different 
missiles that were targeted here in the United States, the city of Wichita and this 
area was one of the targets that they had to get to because they knew that we built 
bombers and they knew that we could perform and they knew that the people here in 
Wichita and the state of Kansas could get the planes off the ground. 
 
What ways, besides the economy, did Boeing and the whole aviation industry shape 
Wichita, and continue to shape Wichita… I guess the infrastructure, the people, the 
culture. In what ways did they shape Wichita? 
 
Well they have affected our community in a lot of different ways. Not to mention the 
fact that with the Boeing Company being here uh, they’re having their presence, one 
it brought a lot of community pride and it actually ended up integrating itself too. 
When you talk about community pride and the things that they were involved in and 
supported of the community, uh, donating. They have always had a philosophy that 
they, you know, you know, they would always ask in employee’s performances, ‘OK, 
what are you doing in the community?’ That was a huge thing for the Boeing 
Company. What are you doing? Are you giving something back? So what they were 
actually doing, they were financially investing, they were helping, but they always 
asked their employees. Expected them to give something back too. And be engaged 
and volunteer. They allowed them to volunteer to be able to help improve the 
community. You know, as you see me doing today. But actually the point of  it 
actually intertwined because, as you know, they just recently celebrated 80 years of 
being here in the city of Wichita. And, they kind of intertwined themselves into the 
community and Kansas and the Midwest DNA. I mean, as I said, you couldn’t speak 
of aviation without talking about Boeing company here. But the other portion is, I 
have seen where you had, where you had three and four generations that have 
worked at the Boeing company. They have family gatherings. And, you know, we are 
coming up on thanksgiving here, and at Thanksgiving you would have great grandpa 
saying, you know, well back in 1950 I worked on such and such aircraft and the next 
one is saying ‘well I worked on this,’ and ‘I worked on this,’ you know, and then you 
end up with 20 year olds saying, well I am working on this project right now. And so it 
was part of the dinner table, the family discussion as if you were talking about, you 
know, other family members. The Boeing name was there. And you saw that, and 
you still see that today. 
 
What other ways did they contribute to the community? Help Wichita out? There is 
Cessna stadium on the WSU campus; Intrust Bank Arena of course, how come there 
isn’t a Boeing big thing like that? 
 
Well I would say that maybe they didn’t put their name on anything, but Boeing 
contributes, you know, millions of dollars each year. Whether it be to our homeless 
or whether it be to community projects or whether it be to some of our non profits 
that are here in the community. And not to mention the fact that, you know, it is not 
uncommon that you go someplace and you see a Boeing employee serving on some 
committee, some board, or doing something that has Boeing’s face there. But I think 
more importantly, when you look at what the Boeing Company did. They were 
probably one of the first to really venture out there to grow small businesses in the 
community. You know, they didn’t venture out and say, OK we are going to send this 
work to some other country. They were going out and they were actually, even 
today, as we speak today, the Boeing Company I think the total number is 480 some 
odd small businesses that supply the Boeing Company today. That is just right here 
in the state of Kansas.  
 
What does that mean for those companies now that they are leaving? 
 
Additional jobs. That is interesting, because I know when you first think about and 
think well the Boeing Company’s leaving so we are going to lose that. But actually 
we’re not. Because when you start really thinking about it, it’s like God we really do– 
its really important to have the Boeing company name here, and uh, you know, and 
in our minds we think we really hate to see them leave… and we do. But then you 
have to ask yourself, ‘are they really leaving?’ and the question is is, the day that 
they take the sign off the building, tomorrow will you see the Boeing name anyplace? 
And you remember those fuselages on those trains that are leaving? They will still 
say Boeing. The fuselages will still say Boeing on the side of them, because Spirit 
Aerosystems, 80 percent of the work that they actually perform in building the 
fuselages for all those different aircraft that you heard me.. all of those different 
models from the Boeing family, they are still building those. They are still building a 
lot of the wings, the ailerons, the engines. They are still doing those things, and so 
those rail cars will still say Boeing on the side of them. The other interesting thing is, 
as long as that company is manufacturing, as long as the Boeing company is still 
selling planes, the model doesn’t change because they leave here. All of those 
businesses that had been supplying them with machine parts, or with various 
different services, will still being supplying them with those services. The only 
difference is every time that you see the company announce that they have made a 
sell, guess what? When they sell X amount of planes, we have to restructure here to 
see how we can support that and we hire more people. So the total amount that they 
have is several billion dollars that they are actually investing right now, just in Spirit 
Aerosystems and our small subcontractors that are right here within this region. 
Nothing will change; with the exception of we don’t have that name that is out there, 
on the side of a building. But their presence will still be here and we will still see it 
each and everyday.  
 
What was that like last year when you found out that they were leaving? 
 
Well you hear it and it is immediate and it happened so quickly, you think, Oh my, 
this can’t happen to us. They have been here for all of these years, and then you 
hear something of that nature, you know, and to us it was like loosing a family 
member and then we started thinking about, there is 2100 employees, what 
happened to them? But you don’t think about all these other things. And so, yes we 
were disappointed and uh, but then like three days later, you know, we started 
getting phone calls and they were saying. ‘Well Mayor, do you know exactly when 
they are leaving? I am interested in 400 engineers.’ ‘I am interested in X amount of 
people that can do this.’ Or, ‘ All my other aviation companies are starting to 
rebound,’ or starting to grow. So, Boeing is in a unique position where they have this 
skilled workforce, and we are blessed even to have that in the state of kanas. But 
Boeing has a skilled workforce that can’t be touched, anywhere in the world. So, 
when there is a need for them, there is somebody out there willing to pick them up. 
And we’ve even saw that when Boeing was here in full force. Individuals would leave 
the Boeing Company for various different reasons, and immediately they are hired 
within a week someplace else. So, everyone recognized that we have a skilled 
workforce that is an amazing skilled workforce, that, ‘Hey, that person is trained and 
I am taking him.’ So, there’s a home for each and every person that actually decide 
that they are going to stay here. But, yes we were disappointed. And we would have 
like to have their name stay here, but when you start really looking at it, they didn’t 
leave. They’re not leaving. They are just taking down the name. The people will still 
be here, the employees will still be here, and we’ll still have their name going down 
the rail every single day, uh, here in the city of Wichita. And so a lot of the work that 
they are actually doing, at Spirit, most recently they just announced that they were 
increasing and sold a large number of 737s as you remember. All of my 
manufacturing companies and all of the other suppliers were saying, ‘OK we have to 
ramp up, we have to hire more people, ‘How many people are you going to need?’ 
‘Well we think that we are going to need somewhere between 100, 1500.’ ‘Well how 
many do you need, we are going to need from the small businesses, we think we are 
going to need 50, or 25.’ Or what ever the case may be. ‘So where do we get them?’ 
So, it caused us to start and try and push and say OK, NCAD we need you to train 
more people so we can meet these demands that these people are going to need. 
Just because the Boeing company actually sold more planes and it still had an 
impact on the city of Wichita, and of course a positive impact. 
 
Do you have, like, friends or neighbors or colleagues that are leaving to go to Texas 
or Oklahoma or Seattle with Boeing? 
 
Oh yes. I have lots of friends, some that are working in Tulsa in Oklahoma, and 
some of them are in Seattle, Washington that are working today. You know, I was 
flying back home from China the other day, a couple weeks ago and saw one of the 
guys and he was in the airport and he’s coming back home, but he was working in 
the northwest. Yes, you see them all the time. 
 
What would you like to see happen to the Boeing facilities after the completely 
withdraw and close down? 
 
I would like for the Boeing facility, I would like for the community, for us to figure out 
what we can do. Uhh, one that is going to continue to grow our business, our 
aviation industry, and if that means growing Spirit Aerosystems some more, because 
I know that Spirit Aerosystems is busting at the seams. You know, they are the 
largest employer now, and they are still saying that, you know, we need more space. 
So that is one of the things that we as a community need to make that decision as to 
what’s in the best interest. Because we don’t want to change anything, or any model 
of what we actually have. We have something that is actually working, and it has 
worked for us for this many years. We want to continue that effort, and we need to 
advance ourselves. So the facility themselves– make sure that we make the right 
decision as to what that, what we actually are able to work with the Boeing company. 
Because you know, they own the property. But they are working with us, they are 
talking to us, we visit almost weekly. And trying to figure out what their timelines are, 
what their schedules are, and try to figure out what opportunities that are out there 
for the Boeing facility. I don’t want you to think that the Boeing facilities are 
something where there is nobody else that want this property, because that is not a 
true statement. Because we are finding out uh, that … that there is so many different 
aviation companies that are saying, we are interested in coming there. I mean, this is 
the mecca for aviation, we have the skilled workforce in place, we have the support 
agencies to train, we have the research and technology with NIAR, we have 
everything that you could possibly have. With the help of Boeing that actually 
invested in this, who actually put this all in place to make is who we are today. And 
so, they are coming and saying, ‘hey we are interested in those facilities.’ So, it will 
be filled, that much I am almost sure of.  
 
I am going to back up a little, but when Boeing was here and in its prime, what kind 
of employer was it for Wichita? How did it treat its employees and how did people 
feel to work for Boeing? 
 
Well, having has, having been one of the individuals to have a 20-year letter from the 
Boeing company, um, … it was a good company to work for. And you had a lot of; 
you had a lot of pride uh, in being able to work for them. We were, Boeing 
employees were, we believed that we were unique and we were different because 
we worked for the Boeing Company. We would go to other places, and I have to say 
that many of them had some what of an ego, the employees, because individuals 
say, ‘well, we build aircraft.’ So, Boeing employees would say, ‘No. We build aircraft.’ 
Because some of our aircraft were a block and two blocks long. And, uh, so we had 
an opportunity to do a lot of things that were different that other people didn’t have 
that opportunity to do. I mean you are talking about for the Boeing company, you are 
building commercial airliners, and in the modification section we are building like, J 
Stars, fighters, the President’s plane. I mean, that’s like saying I work in the White 
House, or I work for the President, or I work for the Pentagon, it wasn’t uncommon 
for Boeing employees to see, you know, the speckled trout and those things from the 
Pentagon and General Powell and those individuals to fly in and check out planes or 
do something, some business that wasn’t uncommon to see other countries fly in 
and take care of various different business, whether it was from Arab countries or 
wherever from around the world. You had an opportunity to do that. Boeing 
employees, their positions and their jobs were very unique in that they had an 
opportunity to see and to meet people that most Americans would never even see or 
meet in their lives. They had an opportunity to work on aircraft when we went off to 
war. They had, they knew that, in that point in time, they knew what they had worked 
on was defending this country, you know, with the latest technology. They knew 
when we had Desert Storm, like, they had a general idea of what that plane would 
actually do, but my, you know, actually seeing it perform, it gave a sense of pride, so 
I’ve seen many of the employees with a sense of pride. And, they were very quick, if 
they walked into a room they were quick to tell you that they work for the Boeing 
Company and they were quick to give you their first name, and tell you who you 
were. Boeing was a good company. They made sure that their employees were 
always paid very well. And, uh, they provided opportunities for everybody.  
 
Why did they decide to leave? 
 
It was just a business decision, and what their business model. And as you saw, 
years ago they moved their corporate office from Washington to Chicago, they did 
have any aviation in Chicago, and they started expanding their business model 
where they started getting into space technology, and all these other things. So it 
was just a business decision that they, uh, decided, OK, as we start downscaling, 
and we shouldn’t have been surprised with the recession that we actually had, and a 
lot of businesses were doing a lot of things differently, its just aviation always 
seemed to lap when we would go into recession, they were the last to go into the 
recession, and they are the last to come out of it. So when everything is starting to 
get better you think everything is fine. Well, you keep forgetting that portion where 
they are always two or three years behind. 
 
When you are out in the community, how, what sort of feeling do you get from 
Wichitans about how they feel about Boeing now? 
 
There is a lot of discussion probably the first two or three weeks, but nowadays 
everyone recognizes OK, you know, change is difficult, but we are moving on. 
Everyone is well aware, that hey, the Boeing company’s still going to be here in a 
sense because you know, they are still making their investments, they are still going 
to support the community, they are still going to make jobs, they still are going to 
support the small businesses. All the different things and the structures that they 
have that are actually in place will stay in place. And Spirit Aerosystems will still be 
building Boeing product.  
 
Um, are there any impacts of the closing for the City government? For Wichita as a 
whole? 
 
Yeah, I don’t think so. Because we are having, our hands are full just trying to 
manage the future of the property itself. We have greater Wichita Economic, we 
have a lot of other aviation companies saying OK, we are interested in a highly 
skilled workforce, and we are interested in seeing what we can actually do. And they 
are not just large companies, they are small companies, um, that are saying we are 
interested in doing some things with the property. But as far as our economy and 
what the impact will be, no its not going to affect us, because they are still making 
those billion dollar investments here, in the city of Wichita. And they are still creating 
jobs. And when they make sales, it will still grow our businesses, it will just be from a 
distance.  
 
Are there any direct opportunities as a result of them leaving? 
 
Well, we are finding out that the opportunities that you have is aviation companies 
that never even dreamed of coming here are now calling us. And when we ask them, 
well, why didn’t you– I mean to the extent that they actually question, like, how did 
you get my home phone number? And, to the extent of saying, OK, why didn’t you 
call us before? And they said, what we wanted wasn’t available at that time. And that 
is interesting that they would say something like that, and you are like, well I guess 
you are right. So we here, our Greater Wichita Economic Development partners and 
business community, and everyone at the chamber and the city of Wichita, and 
Sedgwick County, and the governors office, everyone is getting phone calls almost 
weekly that someone is interested. And you know, these are people who are serious. 
Seriously interested. But, we are also looking at what the impact is going to be, and 
they’re making their investments. We know the investments are going up several 
billion dollars because of the fact that they, the more planes they sell the more their 
investments go up, and more planes we have to produce, more jobs that we have 
created, more suppliers that we have to create. And so, it’s certainly provided some 
additional opportunities for us, and it has caused is to step back, re–evaluate, but 
also recognize that you know, with them here we were very comfortable, and we 
were very happy with what we had. But within making that announcement, it spurred 
a lot of other excitement, and cause us to start thinking and finding out that there are 
new opportunities for that. So, it is one of those things that you took lemons and you 
made it into lemonade, and then added some cherry flavor to it, actually, HAHAHA.  
 
This might be an unfair question, but are we better off? 
 
Well, when you look at our heritage, we are the Midwest, and we are very, very close 
to our heritage and no matter what you see they go on and the difference is that we 
are very proud of our heritage being Midwest, we are very proud of being Kansans. 
And so, as you heard me say, the Boeing company is like a family, it is part of a 
family, it is generation to generation to generation that has given family members 
bragging rights. It has been that portion that has had a key role in family gatherings 
and their conversations, and yet it has, with them leaving, it does create that kind of 
a challenge for us. That maybe won’t be the first topic of the conversation. But I can 
assure you that before the family gathering is over they will say, ‘but you know, I 
work at Spirit, but I am building this particular aircraft for the Boeing Company, and I 
am still playing a major role in this country.’ And whether it is building tankers, or any 
of those types of things, we are still playing a major role in this country in aviation, 
which is the number one export in the world. 
 
When you are out beyond Kansas, do you get the feeling that people who aren’t 
really familiar to Wichita, or Kansas, think this is a huge hit for us? 
 
Not really, individuals hated to see what actually happened, and uh, what actually 
happened to us. And of course I had some mayors who called me and said, ‘hey we 
want to thank you, we are sorry, but we want to thank you.’ But uh, when you start 
explaining to them what advantages it has created for us, and then secondly, the 
only thing that is happening is they made their investment, they made their mark 
here, they have been here for 80 years, and yes the sign may be coming off the 
building, and the presence and investment is still here. And once you explain it to 
them, they say OH, OK. And the conversation dies because they look at is as, you 
know, we’ve had a wonderful run, and we are going to continue the conversation of 
the Boeing Company and Spirit Aerosystems and aviation and we are seeing more 
and more as it is growing and providing new opportunities, so you know, they are a 
legacy here and it will never change. And everyone will still be proud of the fact that 
someone may have worked at the Boeing Company, or generations may have 
worked at the Boeing Company. And, you know, you still go to someone’s home and 
you see you know, a letter of appreciated from the Boeing Company for5 years, or 
10 years, or a job well done on a particular project. You still see those today, and 
you know, and you will continue to see them. And you know, some of those things, 
the legacy that the Boeing Company had, it has been passed on to Spirit 
Aerosystems and uh, and they identify. The whole world knows that it’s a 700 model, 
it’s the Boeing Company.  
 
(Film guy) It seems like the aviation was born, sort of, here, we know North Carolina 
and all that stuff, but sort of, born and grown here. And Boeing was a big part of that, 
that whole industry was really grown up here, within Wichita. 
 
Yes. Um, the Boeing Company pretty much set the tone, as to aviation here, of 
course, as you know. The Boeing Company was here, then Cessna came, and uh, 
we were talking to Mayor Humphreys, the former Mayor of Oklahoma City, and, just 
the other day, and he kept bringing to our attention that we stole Cessna from 
Guthrie, OK. But I just think it was one of those things that Cessna just saw the light, 
that this was where the air capital of the world was going to be and we want to be 
there. But uh, you have seen a lot of our aviation companies kind of grow off of, 
getting close to the Boeing Company because yes, the Boeing Company had 
something that they needed, and we embraced aviation. We were here, we played a 
major role you know, in a lot of things that had to do with this country. And, 
defending it from a military aspect. And Boeing was the leader in that and a lot of 
individuals, a lot of families moved here for that particular reasons, and so there was 
a heritage that was actually passed on. But if you go to any of our aviation 
companies, I am sure that you will go through and you will find a fairly large 
percentage saying, ‘Yeah, I worked at the Boeing Company at some point in time.’ 
Particularly if you talk about baby boomers. You know, ‘how did you get into 
aviation?’ ‘ Well, I started out at Boeing.’ So, you know, I think it has been beneficial 
for all of the aviation companies. But, it is something that we have continued to 
nourish and continue to build on by having the Boeing Company started there, and 
you know, just this aviation cluster and the status that we have worldwide has 
continued to grow and uh, and we as a community are extremely proud of it and we 
are going to continue to invest in it. And now, you are seeing other countries are 
saying, you know, we think we are interested in your aviation cluster and your 
aviation industry. And what, you know, all of these its like the Boeing Company was 
the great grandfather. If we started talking about aviation and our legacy, how we 
actually started, then from the aviation standpoint you say, ‘OK, the Boeing 
Company is the great grandfather, who started all of it for all of us and this is why we 
are here today. 
 
Is that kind of how you hope Wichitans will remember Boeing? 
 
Yeah I hope that they remember it that way. But you know, I don’t think it is going to 
take much encouragement. I think they remember it that way. I mean, just go to the 
thanksgiving dinners that will be coming up next week, and I think that when you see 
them coming together, I think you will see those certificates of appreciation from the 
Boeing Company and you will see those grandchildren and all the individuals have 
those discussions. And even for me, my father in law, he started out at the Boeing 
Company and he ended up doing sales for Cessna. And we have the Thanksgiving 
dinner its, you know, we have the conversation about the Boeing company, although 
everyone’s they are in the medical field and they are attorneys, But, I always had 
those discussions about aviation, and you know, what planes are being built. And of 
course there is always a difference that they, each generation thinks theirs can build 
it a whole lot better than the next so. HAHAHA. And they played a much bigger role. 
So I think that you know, I see the Boeing Company as being the ones, the ones that 
actually pioneered, kicked us off, started, got everything going. And, helped us move 
in the direction of being the Air Capital of the world. At one point this area was, was 
designated as the princess of the plains, and most people don’t know that, and when 
we got here to the aviation business it wasn’t the princess of the plains, it was the air 
capital of the world. And so we take great pride. Even when I travel to other 
countries, I say it and there is no one saying, ‘Heck No! You’re not correct.’ Even 
when you are in China. In fact they talk about us, and they call us the air capital and 
its not going to change. And we as a community and we as the state of Kansas, we 
have something to be proud of. And yes, just as generations are coming along, and 
aircraft are changing and things are changing around us each and every day, so do 
our industries, and in this particular case, Boeing Company is moving its name, but 
they have a legacy that is going to be easy continuing on in this community, and we 
are going to see it each and every day right along K15, right along I35, right along 
this bridge that is coming through, that is through downtown. You will see those 
fuselages with the Boeing Company on the side of them. And uh, individuals, 
citizens with pride that they had a part that they were able to do that. 
 
I think that it is unless there is something else.. 
 
No, I am just blessed to have been able to work for the Boeing Company, and I have 
the same pride as everyone else, and I have the chance to work on some amazing 
programs, from bombers, to fighters, to the president’s plane. And J starts, things 
that protect us more each time. And those are the things that you just can’t take 
away because you know when you are working on it, what roll you are playing that 
affects the history of this country. When you are doing it, you have 1000s of people 
that are working on that ability to be able to carry this on. And their grandchildren. 
You know, I hear something now when we have some discussion, ‘we my grand 
grandfather worked on the B52, and I mean, they pass these stories on from 
generation to generation, so. So, Boeing’s going to live on here in the city of Wichita. 
Whether it be from their investments in the community to helping the city itself grow 
or whether it is sharing that family’s story. History is history, and you cant change it, 
and they were a big part of Kansas, America, and Wichita’s history. 
 
It will be sad we won’t get those visits from Air Force One anymore. 
 
That’s true, that’s true. Or maybe we can get the President to fly it back in. HAHAHA.
