Interview conducted by Katelyn Reuther 
Fred Lee is the owner of Sang Lee Farms in Peconic, New York. 
This was a 
remote interview conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fred Lee joined the 
interview from Peconic, New York, and Katie Reuther joined from Boston, Massachusetts.

Introductions 
00:00:43 
Fred is second generation in the United States. His father was born in Floral Park, 
Long Island, and his mom was born in Calgary, Canada. Fred's mom ended up 
going back to Hong Kong with her family, where she grew up and received her 
schooling. She was taught bilingually with proper Cantonese. Fred's father grew 
up in the United States, and his parents spoke Toisanhua (
Taishanese). Growing 
up, Fred spoke closer to his mom's dialect. 
They ate mostly Chinese dishes, including rice, vegetables, and some meat here 
and there. This was scattered among pizza, spaghetti, and other American foods. 
Pizza was a 
treat in the 1950s, and they had it once every other week or so, in 
addition to hamburgers and hot dogs on the grill. The majority of the meals were 
sit-down family gatherings with a 
bowl of rice, chopsticks, vegetables, and a 
selection of food. 
00:03:16 
Fred's grandfather on his father's side of the family was a 
laundryman in Queens. 
That's where Fred's father and his siblings worked. After fighting in World War II 
and being discharged from the Navy, Fred's father, along with everyone else in 
the family, swore they wouldn't continue the laundromat. Fred's father joined one 
of his brothers and a 
cousin to form the original partners of Sang Lee Farms. Over 
time, each farm partner had one son, and all three of them ended up joining the 
farm to make six partners in the business. 
Every summer growing up, Fred worked on the farm along with his cousins and 
extended family. Even though there were only three original partners in Sang Lee 
Farms, Fred had other cousins and uncles that were involved in the farm in

different ways. For example, some uncles were part of a 
corporation they had in 
Florida. After graduating from undergraduate school and working for two years 
on the farm, Fred thought working on the farm might not be for him. He decided 
to go back to school to get his MBA (Master of Business Administration) at 
Boston University. 
In the last semester of his second year, Fred's father passed away from kidney 
cancer. He passed away in September, and Fred ended up jumping into the 
business soon after. Because Fred came back in December, he went directly to the 
Florida operation. He began working there while typing his papers at night. He 
eventually completed his degree, but he thinks that if he hadn't had that hiccup in 
his personal life, he might not have come back to the farm. Fred was getting into 
computer programming, and he had a 
research assistant position in graduate 
school. He knew one of his professors wanted him to stay on to continue working 
together. 
The disruption to Fred's family brought him back to the farm, and the rest is 
history. Once he started, he got more and more involved. His father passed away 
in the fall of 1980, and when Fred was finished with his stint in Florida, he 
transitioned to the New York operation the next spring. In the late fall again, Fred 
went back to Florida and things continued from there. 
00:10:48 
At that time, the first crops his family grew were all Chinese vegetables. The idea 
was to grow bok Choy, gai Choy, and a 
number of other things, like mustard 
greens, Chinese broccoli, flowering Chinese cabbage, and some squashes, to sell 
into the New York City Chinatown areas. It was a 
ready market, because there 
were not that many vegetables available. The Asian population during that time 
period was also steadily increasing. They started marketing to Chinatowns in 
Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington. Fred's father concentrated more on the 
growing, while his siblings took over markets in different cities. Through the GI 
Bill, Fred's father took some agricultural courses in Long Island when he returned 
from World War 11. That formed the basis for his growing knowledge. 
When Fred was an undergraduate, he took a 
handful of agricultural courses in 
plant soil science, botany, plant pathology, and similar subjects. Although he 
wasn't planning on making it his major, he had a 
small sampling of agricultural 
courses at the college level. 
They started marketing to New York City, and every year, the market seemed to 
grow in size. The farm thrived. In 1964, they ended up moving the farm operation 
to a 
larger farm where they were able to lease adjacent tracts of land. That was 
one of the first big moves. In the late 1950s, they also moved from a 
rental farm 
in Florida to another farm where they purchased a 
land company. There were 
Fredrick Lee Interview Log, February 24, 2021 
2 
three hundred and twenty acres, and when Fred became involved, they ended up 
renting an adjacent section from a 
neighbor. The farm was one mile by one mile 
square. They had the farm in Florida under a 
slightly different company name, 
and then Sang Lee Farms was in New York. In addition to the original two 
hundred and twenty acres in New York, they ended up renting another several 
hundred acres. They were cropping over one thousand acres in New York and 
Florida over the course of a 
season. 
That was all wholesale truck farming to distributors, wholesalers, and restaurants 
in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington. They shipped some air 
freight containers to Chicago and ran a 
few trucks into Toronto. Fred started and 
helped do the marketing on a 
regular basis to Montreal, Canada, and they sent 
shipping containers of certain Chinese vegetables down as far as Miami, Florida. 
They also had customers in Georgia and Washington, D.C. outside of the 
Chinatown areas. 
00:16:42 
Fred says his father and uncles' desire to grow Chinese vegetables might have 
come partly from a 
lack of access to them growing up. They weren't readily 
available, but today you can walk into a 
supermarket and there will likely be su 
Choy or bok Choy, ginger, and more. That's catering more to current consumer 
demand for a 
diverse vegetable selection. Back then, it was a 
factor of several 
things. There were limited choices for career paths, even if you were college-
educated. If you had a 
high school degree or minimal college education, the 
career paths were limited for Asian Americans. Farming seemed like a 
good path, 
and after a 
few years, they saw some potential for growth and kept going. 
00:18:12 
When Fred worked on the farm after college, it was typically six to six, twelve 
hours a 
day. Going to college was a 
piece of cake compared to working full-time 
on the farm. In prior years, Fred had only worked during the summer and on 
weekends, so it was like a 
break to see his friends and do other things. Working 
full-time, however, was very serious. He remembers feeling socially stagnant and 
experiencing a 
number of things that made him want to leave. They worked six to 
seven days a 
week, and there was no such thing as social media, email, or cell 
phones. All of the people that Fred knew as friends were school friends. Going 
back to school seemed like a 
good social opportunity. 
Fred ended up first going back to the University of Vermont to study business and 
take business courses, which he did for one semester. He was there the fall of 
1978, and then he started at Boston University the winter or spring semester of 
1979. Fred ended up meeting his wife, Karen, at Boston University. Although she 
was studying health care management and Fred was in general finance, they had 
some classes together.

00:21:11 
At twenty-five years old, Fred finished his last semester of graduate school. When 
he first came back to the farm, he was just helping to fill the gaps. A 
few of his 
uncles were still actively managing the operations, and two of his cousins were in 
management positions. When Fred came in, he wasn't taking over, but instead 
was filling the absence his father's passing had created. He also felt a 
responsibility to be with his mom. 
When his father passed, Fred felt the draw to come back, help, and do what he 
could to take care of things. He soon got caught up in it and didn't have a 
chance 
to look back. Because it was December, Fred knew he would be going to Florida 
if he went back to help out on the farm. Karen, who he was dating at the time, 
decided she would go with Fred to Florida and see what happened. They were 
married the following fall in October of 1981. 
They started a 
family and traveled back and forth between New York and Florida 
for six years. They moved twelve times, going back and forth every six months. 
When Fred's oldest daughter was preparing to start kindergarten, Karen told Fred 
she didn't want to move the kids anymore. 1986 was their last operating season in 
Florida. 
During that same time period, there were a 
lot of things taking place within the 
family. The senior partners decided to retire, and in 1986, one of Fred's cousins 
decided he didn't want to continue. Some other uncles who were land 
shareholders were getting older and beginning to pass on, so contracts for sale 
were executed for some of the farm parcels. In the 1986-1987 time period, there 
was quite a 
bit of turmoil. In 1987, Fred and his cousin, Richard, moved the farm 
to their current location in New York. 
When they first moved the farm, they were just renting. About four years into a 
five-year lease, Fred asked his landlord if he could renew for another five years. 
The landlord said he didn't want to rent anymore, and they started looking for 
land in other locations, including out of state. The landlord told Fred he wanted to 
sell the farm to him. Since Fred didn't have the money to buy it, nor could he get 
the loans to buy it, the landlord offered to hold the note and have Fred pay interest 
only. At the end of ten years, they would have a 
balloon payment. Fred and 
Richard were able to scrape together a 
down payment, and the interest payments 
ended up being comparable to the rent. 
Two and a 
half years later, Richard decided he wanted to stop farming. Fred made 
a 
plan to purchase Richard's shares over ten years. He had a 
note to Richard and 
another note to his landlord, who was the mortgage-holder for the farm. In a 
way, 
Fred was flying by the seat of his pants. He had studied enough finance and 
accounting to know that when certain notes were coming due, he would have to 
Fredrick Lee Interview Log, February 24, 2021 
4 
rotate thirty days off the books to prove that he was liquid enough. He would 
borrow from one bank to pay another bank operating note off, go off thirty days, 
and then take out a 
loan from the first bank again, pay the other off, and rotate off 
thirty days. The banks were aware that one was holding one note and the other 
was being paid off, and then they were switching. As long as Fred could meet his 
other obligations, all was good. 
Things were pretty tight, and they lived a 
frugal life. The biggest financial 
changes for them were the changes in the wholesale market. Historically, it was 
very worthwhile, and they could earn a 
living, pay their debts, and replace 
equipment. In the later 1990s and early 2000s, the market changed dramatically. 
Closing the Florida farm both shrank their competitive edge as a 
year-round 
supplier and shrank the size of their operation to a 
couple hundred acres. All of 
the wholesalers and distributors they were dealing with before had to find another 
supplier. Those suppliers were in California, Mexico, and Canada. 
The wholesale market became extremely competitive. Things were being sent to 
distributors on consignment, which meant they didn't have to pay for anything up 
front. They could deduct their commission from what they sold and return the rest 
to the grower. Fred couldn't operate that way. He had ongoing payroll and 
operating expenses. The wholesale market almost brought an end to their 
business. It didn't matter how well they were farming or what the quality of their 
produce was. It all came down to price. Fred couldn't match the low prices of 
other suppliers. 
In the late 1990s, the kids were in grade school, and Karen started selling bunches 
of flowers on the road in front of the farm. Little by little, it went from flowers to 
selling some heads of bok choy. When customers would come to buy flowers, 
they would see the field trucks go by and ask about the produce. They were 
selling by the pallet to the wholesale market, and Karen would go into the trailer, 
open up one of the boxes, and take a 
few heads of bok choy out without telling 
Fred. The partially-full boxes would then be sent to Fred's customers, who would 
complain to him about receiving underweight boxes. 
Fred is grateful for all of Karen's efforts and everything she did, because the retail 
farmstand grew every year. The first season, it was only a 
couple hundred dollars, 
but the next season, it doubled, and the season after that, it doubled again. Karen 
would bag everything they grew, from Asian vegetables to mixed baby greens, 
and sell it at the retail level. While she could sell a 
bag of lettuce for five dollars, 
Fred was only getting five dollars for a 
fifty pound box of bok choy delivered into 
the City. 
Fredrick Lee Interview Log, February 24, 2021

The economics started to shift, and fortunately, as the wholesale market continued 
to collapse, retail saved them. All of their revenue for the past fifteen or twenty 
years has been generated by direct-to-consumer sales at the retail level. It was a 
slow, gradual change over the years. Fred attributes the survival of the farm to all 
of Karen's work. The stress of changing, growing, and trying to figure it out was 
very hard on everyone, but ultimately it worked. 
00:39:06 
Almost every year, Fred thought about stopping and moving on to something else. 
Even though their retail was growing, their wholesale was shrinking. This meant 
that their revenue was holding flat while their expenses were slowly increasing. 
Their margins were being squeezed, and there were a 
couple of years that were 
very difficult. Fred doesn't know how they made it through. 
00:40:25 
At one time, they had ten or twelve family members involved with the farm. 
There were uncles that were doing different routes and cousins that were working 
in the business. Eventually, it was just Fred and his family. That was a 
huge 
transition, but it took place over many years. The next big transition was their 
transition to organic production. 
When they were doing more retailing, customers would ask them if the produce 
was sprayed. Some people have said that they're geniuses, because they started 
growing organically when consumer demand wanted organic foods. However, in 
reality, as the primary pesticide applicator, Fred didn't want to handle the 
materials anymore. His father died of cancer, and although there could have been 
a 
lot of factors, exposure is a 
big one. Fred didn't want to spray the vegetables he 
was going to be harvesting, eating himself, and feeding to his kids. He says it was 
almost a 
selfish move. 
He started transitioning away from using chemical insecticides and decreasing his 
use of chemical fungicides and herbicides. The last thing he was reluctant to let go 
of was the chemical fertilizer. He figured no one wanted to buy yellow heads of 
lettuce or shriveled-up tomatoes. He didn't know a 
whole lot about other sources 
of organic matter and nitrogen. Over the years, he realized that he could use soil 
amendments that are organically approved, such as pasteurized poultry litter, 
slaughterhouse non-bovine blood meal, and peanut meal. It's much slower 
reacting in the soil, and the nitrogen was much slower in availability, but it did 
provide sufficient nutrients for the crops to grow properly. He had to adjust his 
cultural practices to accommodate those materials, which took place over years. 
There were some hits and misses, not just with the cultural practices, but also with 
crops, markets, and more. Each year, they built on the successes of the past year 
and were able to make the transition. 
Fredrick Lee Interview Log, February 24, 2021

They were certified organic in 2007, but it took a 
number of years to get to that 
point. Not all of the fields were certified organic initially, so they had to segregate 
the crops in the cooler and designate which ones were certified organic or not. In 
2006, they started their first CSA (Community Supported Agriculture), and Fred 
says it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. They started with thirty-three 
members, and it was wonderful. People in the community join and pre-pay for 
their vegetables up front, which allowed Fred to have some operating revenue and 
borrow a 
little bit less from the bank. 
Over the years, it grew so that Fred didn't have to sign an operating note every 
year with the bank. He can't say enough good things about it. For about twelve 
years, they continued to grow before leveling off. There are other farms doing 
CSAs, and people have an unlimited choice of where they can get their vegetables 
from, including supermarkets, Whole Foods, mail order, and more. It is a 
competitive market, but all of those years they were able to grow the CSA were 
extremely significant for their survival and financial sustainability. 
In 2008, they worked with a 
nonprofit organization called Just Food. The 
organization helped mentor farms and matched them with communities they 
thought would be a 
good fit in terms of pricing, variety of vegetables, and 
experience of the farmer and community. Fred's farm was matched with three 
Brooklyn sites three years in a 
row. There was a 
core team of volunteers at those 
sites who would help sign up members and coordinate social meetings for 
potential CSA members to meet Fred and Karen. Every year, they tried to add 
another CSA 
group, community group, or distribution site. That was one of the 
most significant developments in the farm business, as far as their sustainability 
and ability to finance their operations. Without the CSA, it would've been very 
difficult. 
00:49:50 
Last year (2020), they had around eight hundred CSA members. That's a 
good 
size for them. It gives them a 
good starting point, where they know that 
everything they grow is going to that market. If they grow more, it goes to the 
farmers market or farmstand. It is the foundation of their production, because they 
know exactly how many people they're growing for, how many rows and flats to 
grow of particular crops, how many tomato rows, and what varieties. They have 
twenty-four weeks in the CSA and stage everything to be harvested in that time 
period. 
00:51:12 
Some of the CSA members are attracted to their farm, because they grow Asian 
vegetables. They survey their members at the end of the year, and Fred 
remembers having some CSA groups that didn't want any more bok Choy after 
receiving it in the share only five or six times. For someone who grew up eating 
bok choy almost every day of his life, that didn't seem like too much to Fred. 
Fredrick Lee Interview Log, February 24, 2021 
7 
Even if they gave it out every other week over the course of the season, that 
seemed acceptable. 
A 
couple of years ago, they had a 
whole group of Asian CSA members in Queens. 
They thought that it would be a 
home run, but then it turned out that they didn't 
grow enough Asian vegetables for them. A 
number of the members were 
Buddhist, and they believed in not eating certain food groups, such as alliums, 
which make up a 
significant part of the farm's fall shares. The group ended up 
deciding not to participate in subsequent years. 
00:53:36 
From the 1940s to late 1990s, they almost exclusively grew Chinese vegetables. 
In the late 1990s, the competition increased as Chinese vegetables began coming 
from Canada, Mexico, and California. In response, Fred started getting into mixed 
baby greens and herbs. That was his first venture away from Chinese vegetables, 
and it helped launch their retail sales. From the baby lettuces, they started 
growing head lettuce. From the head lettuces, they started growing varieties of 
tomatoes. The list grew from there. 
00:55:27 
The shift away from Chinese vegetables to a 
wider variety of produce feels fine 
for Fred. He remembers that growing up, one of his summer tasks as a 
kid was to 
collect, process, and grade the seeds they would use later on. Almost all of the 
varieties of Chinese cabbage were open-pollinated. They would leave one row 
unharvested, and Fred was directed by his dad to cull out the funny looking ones 
and select for late-bolting plant vigor, good color, size, and disease resistance. 
They would allow those heads to go to flower and cross-pollinate with the other 
plants in the row or block. Fred would come through later to chop the flowering 
cabbage down, dry it, break the seed pods with a 
wooden mallet on a 
canvas, sift 
the chaff away, dry the seed in the sun, and bag it for subsequent use. They did 
that for mustard greens, bok choy, yu choy, gai Ian, squashes, and melons. Those 
were some of the big tasks that he and his cousins had on the farm. 
People ask Fred now if he saves his seed. He doesn't. Virtually one hundred 
percent of their seed comes from seed producers across the world. Fred doesn't 
grow many, if any, open-pollinated varieties. It's important that they get 
something back for every seed they plant. That's not always the case, but anything 
they can do culturally to ensure that there is disease resistance is important. 
Hybrid varieties are permitted in organic production, but genetically modified 
plants or seeds are not. Anything that's chemically produced or treated is also not 
permitted. As a 
certified organic grower, he only has one opportunity to plant the 
best seed variety for a 
particular vegetable or fruit. When they go through the seed 
catalogs, they try to select for the time period they want to grow it in, the variety, 
vigor, disease resistance, days to harvest, whether it will sell, and more. 
Fredrick Lee Interview Log, February 24, 2021

They grow a 
lot of heirloom tomatoes that are not hybrid, and they're very 
sensitive. They taste wonderful, which is how they're marketed. They have 
disease issues and are not able to be shipped long distance. However, if they are 
harvested the night before they go to the farmers market or are put out at the 
farmstand, customers can get a 
ripe, delicious heirloom tomato. That's difficult to 
get in a 
grocery store, because vegetables and food items are typically shipped an 
average of fifteen hundred miles. Varieties are grown for durability and resistance. 
They literally get bounced a 
couple thousand miles before they get to the 
distributor, and then another couple hundred miles or so before arriving at the 
retail outlet. 
1:02:18 
Fred and his family currently lease approximately one hundred acres. They don't 
farm every single acre, but their net crop area is between seventy-five and eighty 
acres. 
1:02:51 
During the summer season, they have around fifty employees. However, not 
everyone is working full-time. In addition to their core staff, they have had high 
schoolers, college kids, and part-time retired people. Labor and employment 
issues are challenging like any other business. They are fortunate to have a 
good 
group of people who come back every year. 
1:03:56 
The majority of Fred's time is not spent in the field. There's nothing he likes more 
than to sit in a 
tractor, cultivate a 
row, and see the sun. However, a 
lot of his time 
over the years has been spent on administrative duties, like payroll, accounts 
payable, accounts receivable, customer communications, emails, and more. Now 
in his later years, Fred sees himself stepping away from production even further. 
His son, Will, and Will's partner, Lucy, have taken over more of the day-to-day 
operations. They have weekly meetings, if not more, where they sit down and 
work through obstacles that are coming up, like policy issues, personnel issues, 
logistics and planning, and things like that. 
1:06:00 
Thinking way back, Fred thinks his dad and uncles were on the outskirts of the 
agricultural community. Fred still has some of the records, including his dad's 
membership certificates from the New York State Farm Bureau. In a 
certain way, 
the agricultural community was good to them. It recognized them as farmers and 
respected them for the labor they put in. However, he doesn't think his dad or 
uncles were invited to the town hall to have beers with the guys. So in that way, 
they were different and somewhat removed. 
In terms of facing discrimination himself, Fred says there may have been a 
few 
uncomfortable moments that he blocked out of his memory. Growing up, he 
remembers other kids would point at him, make faces, and squint their eyes, 
among other things. Even Fred's kids, who are half Asian, experienced some of 
Fredrick Lee Interview Log, February 24, 2021 
9 
that growing up in grade school. Fred was always taught, "Sticks and stones can 
break your bones, but names will never hurt you." He has kept repeating that 
to himself For people in his age bracket, there was absolutely bullying going on. 
It still takes place, and it probably always will. 
There are minor things that happened, but Fred can't specifically say or document 
exactly what took place. When they moved the farm to its current location in 
1987, Fred remembers times when he felt welcomed. The fields were fallow at 
that time, and some people in the local area thought having Chinese cabbage there 
was better than letting it sit fallow. Fred remembers feeling very welcomed by 
some members of the agricultural community. If you were a 
farmer, it didn't 
matter what color your skin was. There were times when he didn't experience the 
harsh discrimination that occurred in other time periods of his life. 
Fred doesn't think they were really barred or prevented from selling their 
products anywhere. If someone wasn't interested in buying Chinese cabbage, Fred 
just looked for other places to sell. From a 
business perspective, agricultural 
production with Chinese vegetables was a 
give-and-take with a 
market willing to 
accept the vegetables and pay a 
certain amount or not. On a 
personal level, Fred 
has walked into stores where people don't look at him or talk to him. They'll ask 
the person behind him if they need help while he's standing right there. He has 
experienced things like that, but says that's a 
completely different issue. 
He also notes that even when people hear him on the phone, they're surprised 
when they meet him. They're surprised he speaks English and doesn't have an 
accent. Lee can be an English name, so that was not a 
dead giveaway. Some 
people don't even get to the name part and ask, "Where are you from?" 
1:15:58 
Fred comments on whether the farming landscape has changed at all for Asian 
Americans or other people of color since he got into farming. He says farmers or 
people working in agricultural industries only represent one or two percent of the 
U.S. population, and people of color represent a 
small percentage of that. Fred is 
personally disappointed that there aren't more people of color farming. He 
wouldn't say it's active discrimination, but the barriers to entry to start a 
farm are 
huge. The financial requirements to lease a 
tract of land, buy equipment, and pay 
people to work with you is daunting. There are a 
lot of other industries and 
businesses you can start up on your own. 
Starting a 
farm from scratch is very difficult, and even with his stubbornness and 
tenacity, Fred would find it very challenging. It was only after he got involved 
that he wouldn't let it go. Fred understood why his uncles, who were in their 
sixties and seventies, decided to sell the farm, but he asked his mother why she 
signed the sale contract for the farmland. She said she thought Fred could have a 
Fredrick Lee Interview Log, February 24, 2021 
10 
better life than farming, which made him hold on tighter to the farm business. He 
says it was a 
stubborn move. It created difficulties and conflict in his marriage. He 
doesn't have a 
great explanation, but wonders if it was partially what he learned 
growing up. He absorbed that it's not acceptable to admit you're giving up on 
something. If things get difficult, you put in a 
greater effort. You don't give up. 
He's fortunate that it worked out okay, but he didn't come out completely 
unscarred. 
In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, there were a 
lot of small, African American-
owned farms. When Fred was a 
little kid, they had some African American 
workers who followed them between Florida and New York. Their farming 
experience came from operating their own farms down south. They were the 
greatest crew. They knew hot weather, sweat, and hard work, and Fred had great 
respect for them. A 
lot of them were farmers in their own right, but they somehow 
lost their farms or couldn't make them work. 
Historically speaking, there were a 
great number of African American-owned 
farms in a 
lot of the southern states, but there were some discriminatory practices 
by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) and Farm Service 
Administration where loans were not given or different standards were set. Fred 
was lucky to get the loans to operate. If he had not had those loans, he wouldn't 
be here today. If he was down south, of darker skin color, and his operating season 
depended on the loan, he wouldn't have a 
farm. These practices contributed to the 
smaller number of minority-owned farms operating down south and across the 
United States. This happened not just in farm operating loans and the USDA, but 
with housing and other business-related things as well. 
1:24:55 
Fred talks about the changes he would like to see take place across the food 
system. He wishes everyone could have the opportunity to have a 
garden or grow 
a 
little bit of their own food. If the average person could begin to understand the 
time, effort, and resources it takes to grow a 
head of lettuce or a 
radish from seed 
to harvest, it would give a 
much greater appreciation for the food we consume. 
Fred doesn't take it for granted, not just because he works on a 
farm and has had 
to struggle to produce food for himself and his family, but also because his 
parents grew up just post-Depression. His mother lived through the Japanese 
bombing of Hong Kong, when they literally had to eat garbage because there was 
no food. His dad's side of the family also lived very frugally. Fred was taught 
from the beginning never to waste any food. They would eat their leftovers, take 
only what they could eat, and had to finish any food on their plate before they 
could leave the table. 
There's part of Fred that cringes now when he sees people waste food. Fred sees a 
lot of waste and a 
lot of people who don't have the same view of food that he was

brought up with. If people could move toward an understanding and appreciation 
of food, it would become much more important in our society (as it should be). In 
the United States, there's an expectation that food and energy are a 
given. People 
expect food to be very cheap, and it really isn't. Our farms are terribly efficient 
and very productive, but the corn is being fed to cows to produce meat. It's not the 
food that we're eating directly. If people could realize the true cost of food and 
what it takes to grow it, maybe they'd value it differently and wouldn't object so 
much to paying a 
dollar more for Fred's lettuce. Fred does get some pushback at 
the farmers market, which is challenging. Farmers don't make tons and tons of 
money. They sweat the money they make in the farming industry. He wishes 
people could understand what it takes to grow food. 
A 
lot of people pat Fred on the back for the work he is doing, and he has 
worked very hard. However, he says the farm wouldn't be there without all of 
their great staff and the efforts of others. It's been a 
collective effort. If it 
weren't for the guys and women who work in the field, the people in the 
farmstand and in the kitchen, the crew members, the field managers, and 
everyone along the line, Fred wouldn't be here. He's very grateful for their 
willingness, energy, and help with everything that they're doing now.
