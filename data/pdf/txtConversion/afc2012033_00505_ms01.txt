HH: This is February 18, 2013, I am Hannah Harvester from TAUNY and I am at the home of Joe and Sue 
Shultz in Lowville. Could you two introduce yourselves and give a bit of personal history? 
JS: My name is Joe Shultz, I am originally from Delaware County New York and moved to this area when I 
was about 10. I grew up on this farm, I went to Morrisville College for 2 years, then Cornell for 2 years, 
then I worked for the Department of Agriculture for about 6 years, and in 1994 I came back to the farm, 
bought the cattling equipment and leased the farm. 
SS: I am Sue Shultz, and I grew up in Copenhagen [NY] on a dairy farm. 
HH: Let’s talk a little bit about growing up on the farm, what that was like and what sorts of chores you 
did. 
JS: I grew up on this farm with 3 other brothers. We generally only milked between 30 and 40 cows, so 
there probably wasn’t enough work to go around for all 4 of us with my parents because they were both 
home on the farm also. Through early school, we all had chores; feeding calves, helping with the cow 
chores, we never really milked much, my parents used to all the milking, but we would do a lot of 
feeding, and as we got into our teen we generally would get farms off the job. I used to work on a farm 
in West Lowville and my brother used to work for a farm outside of Lowville. My 2 younger brothers 
used to work at a local store in Lowville. We’d do chores here before we went to school, but a lot of 
time we went to the after school jobs, but it was probably because there was not enough work to keep 
us out of trouble.  
(0:02:45) 
HH: Did you enjoy growing up on a dairy farm? 
JS: Yeah, I wouldn’t have it any other way. In this particular location we had farm families up and down 
the road; in a stretch of 3 miles from here to Lowville there was probably 7 or 8 farms. We used to get 
together with neighbor kids for playing softball and that type of stuff. The road was very untraveled, it 
was a rough road, so we used to be on the road a lot with our bikes and stuff. Now with the traffic, as a 
kid, you wouldn’t feel safe on the road, but I enjoyed the local area.

(0:03:29) 
HH: You said you also worked on neighboring farms as you got older? 
JS: In high school I worked for a farm in West Lowville after school every day. 
HH: Doing what kind of work? 
JS: I used to help milk over there. They put in all dry square bales, so it was pretty much doing hay all 
summer long, but I enjoyed it. It was a real clean farm, a well-run farm.  Like I said, I was always here on 
our home farm doing chores also. 
(0:04:05) 
HH: [to Sue]What type of farm did you grow up on? 
SS: There were 3 of us and I was the youngest. We milked anywhere from 100 to 150. There was always 
work to do. We didn’t have off the farm jobs. 
HH: Did you enjoy it? 
SS: I did. 
HH: Did you imagine you would continue to live on a farm. 
SS: Yeah, I tried different jobs after school and I always came back to the farm. 
HH: Do you have an idea what drew you back to the farm? 
SS: Probably the variety. Not doing one thing all the time. You got your schedule of chores and certain 
things that need to be done. Different seasons bring on different job and tasks. 
(0:05:24) 
HH: Joe, would you talk a little bit about how you came back to the farm? 
JS: I worked for the USDA, it was Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. It was before Farm 
Service Agency was developed, prior to that, so it was the USDA ASCS that administered all the Federal 
Farm Programs. When I was at Cornell I pretty much had in mind that I wanted to be a Cooperative 
Extension Agent. I did stay an extra semester and student taught to get my masters, my MAT, but this 
job came up kind of in the middle of that. I student taught thinking I wanted to be an ag. teacher, but it 
didn’t appeal to me, I think the way the kids are, I wasn’t maybe forceful enough. The kids whether or 
not they wanted to be there, high school kids, they don’t really want to be there, where junior college, I 
thought I could teach there because the kids were there because they wanted to be there. Then this job 
came up with the USDA, and I enjoyed it a lot.  
(0:06:45) 
3 
 
HH: What types of work were you doing as part of that job? 
JS: The job started with a training program where you’d travel and be in a different county office for 3 to 
4 weeks learning programs, but also filling in where they needed help. Eventually after about a year, I 
was hired as the County Director for Oswego County. I was stationed in Mexico [NY], heading the office 
with a couple of program assistants and we administered the federal farm programs, the cost sharing for 
seedings, cost sharing for different erosion control measures, also taking acreage reports, doing grain 
loans. 
(0:07:30) 
HH: So what brought you back to the farm? 
JS: I don’t remember exactly if my mother was sick, if that is why maybe my father wasn’t able to do 
everything himself, but I always knew, even over there when I worked for USDA I milked after work for a 
farmer, I always knew eventually I wanted to have a farm of my own. I wasn’t sure if I would start over 
there or come home. I actually ended up coming home and helping with chores here, and driving back 
and forth home to Mexico for a year. 
(0:08:17) 
HH: Was it 1994 that you actually took ownership of the farm? 
JS:  Yes. 
HH: So you said you knew that you would eventually want to have a farm, why? 
JS: I think you just get used to that lifestyle, a good way to bring up kids. The freedom if today is a nice 
day and there is something going on and you would like to go to it, you don’t have to be in an office job 
where you have to be at work 5 days a week. I don’t mind milking 7 days a week because you still have a 
lot of free time. 
(0:09:00) 
HH: Let’s talk about your farm and your set-up. 
JS: We milk about 45 registered Holsteins here and we have another 40 or so young stock from baby 
calves up to bred heifers. They are housed in a tie stall barn with a pipeline milking system. We milk 
twice a day. In the winter time they are fed a total mixed ration of haylage and corn silage, and then a 
mash feed from a feed company. In the summer time we do rotational grazing from the end of April to 
the 1st of October where they are still brought in the barn to milk twice a day and fed a little bit of grain 
and corn silage. For manure, we don’t have a manure storage facility, so it’s pretty much daily spread, 
but in the summer time we do stockpile some manure to be spread on corn ground after the corn is 
harvested. 
(0:10:37)

HH: You are making cheese; is all of your milk going towards making the cheese? 
JS: We ship to the Agri-Mark Cooperative. I think over the year average, a third of our milk goes into 
cheese production. So 2/3 of the milk is still shipped to the Co-op. 
(0:11:03) 
HH: What is the division of labor on your farm? Do you have any employees? 
SS: Just our son. 
JS: Just the 2 of us and our son. 
HH: You have one son? 
JS: He’s 12, gonna be. 
HH: When is his birthday? 
JS: April. 
(0:11:25) 
HH: So who does what? 
JS: It is pretty much, we all go out to the barn together, and our son does the calves chores. He feeds the 
baby calves milk, cleans the baby calves, scrapes heifer pens. Sue and I share chores with the cows 
where I will usually fill the mixer and do the mix, she kind of scrapes down the cows and then we milk 
together, morning and night. Anything else? 
(0:12:07) 
HH: What about the crops?  
JS: For crop work, I generally do a lot of it. Sue with either chop hay or, she can do everything, but now 
she’s been busy with cheese. We still harvest some hay and fill the one silo with haylage. After it is full, it 
is pretty much done for the summer because we graze and don’t feed haylage during the summer. We 
plant corn. We are fortunate to have Sue’s father, who is semi-retired, and he likes to help if we are a 
busy cheese day and have to get some crops done. Also my father does a lot. He helps plant corn, fit 
ground some, and some of the harvesting. 
(0:13:12) 
HH: You mentioned he comes by on cheese making day to help with chores. 
JS: On cheese day, once I get cleaned up, and go in the cheese room, by 9 or so, I wouldn’t want to go 
back into the barn. So he come probably around 11 and scrapes down behind the cows and beds them 
down again, pushes up feed, and makes sure everything is okay in the barn. 
5 
 
(0:13:30) 
HH: When you say scraping down, what do you mean? 
JS: If there is manure on the beds, he will scrape and scrape the center floor so it’s clean. 
HH: You have one of those gutter cleaners? 
JS: Yep, that moves the manure into the manure spreader. 
(0:13:54) 
HH: So your father lives fairly nearby? 
SS: Copenhagen. 
(0:14:00) 
HH: You mentioned that you might be a little bit more reluctant to make some of the changes that are 
going on in the dairy industry. Can you talk about your philosophy about dairy farming? 
JS: I think a big part of it is that I think the cows get better care when it is a family taking care of a herd 
the size a family can take care of. I saw my neighbor up the road one time when we were growing up. He 
had 75 cows and was by himself so he always had hired men. You could always tell what type of hired 
man he had by his mood he was in and how much he’d call and ask us to come and help him with 
something. You get a good hired man for a while, if they are really good eventually they are going to 
want to be on their own and do something different. The other hired men last as long as you can put up 
with them. So we just never, maybe it is because we don’t feel comfortable with a lot of different people 
handling our cows, but I just feel that it is a more desirable situation to have ten 50 cow farms in an 
area, then one 500 cow farm. Even for the economics of our county, if you have 10 families with a farm, 
there are 10 or 20 vehicles, and they are all families with kids going to school, and they’re shopping at 
the local stores, and I think it is a little better for the local economy.  
(0:16:07) 
HH: When did the cheese curd operation start, and how did you come to the decision to start that? 
JS: We started about a year and a half ago. I think the reason we really wanted to get started with it, is 
Sue wanted to do something extra and then she started making cheese curd on the stove. We gave it to 
some friends and it was real popular and we had extra time I think, so we wanted to do something extra. 
We originally wanted to bottle milk, but we didn’t think that would be as receptive to the area because 
you can get good milk at Stewarts. People do ask us if we can sell them whole milk, but the cheese is 
such a popular thing here in Lewis County and I think we are able to sell more pounds of milk worth of 
cheese rather than number of gallons to be people. If we can sell between 400 and 800 gallons worth of 
milk that goes into our cheese, that would be a lot of fluid milk to try to sell to people. 
(0:17:47) 
6 
 
HH: So your cheese curd is mostly staying within Lewis County? 
JS: For the most part, there is some in Jefferson County, there are people that drive here from St. 
Lawrence County, Heuvelton, Philadelphia, there are people from Camden that come up from Oneida 
County. In the stores, we have one store outside of Watertown, but it is mostly in Lewis County. 
(0:18:13) 
HH: I saw you have a self-serve store here, and you also sell in the local stores? 
JS: We probably retail 10 to 20 percent, it varies a lot. Say 15% here, but the rest is wholesale. A lot of it 
is ordered ahead of time and picked up. 
(0:18:46) 
HH: Since you took on the operation, besides the addition of the cheese curd, have there been major 
changes the way you operate things here? 
JS: I guess we just streamlined some things. We added on to the end of the barn. When I first got here, 
we knew we would have to milk more than 30 cows, so we were milking 55 cows or so and then we 
would have heifers and either board them out and have somebody take care of them for the winter 
when they weren’t out grazing, I took them to a neighboring barn and I took feed down to take care of 
them. Then you are adding a whole other set of chores, so when we added on to the main barn, it was 
mostly for young stock. Everyone is under one roof and one barn, and it is easier to take care of. Things 
like that are what we have done primarily. With the grazing system we make improvements to make it 
more efficient, we put up another silo for more forage and storage capacity. I guess that is about it, 
mainly for efficiency.  
(0:20:14) 
HH: Can you talk me through the main tasks of your farm season by season? 
JS: OK. Usually in the spring, crop season starts usually in the middle to the end of April. We fit ground 
for about 50 acres of corn and then we seed down about 10 to 15 acres of an alfalfa mix seeding. The 
corn, we usually like to have that planted by the early to mid-May. We have cows out grazing the last 
day of April or the first of May. In the end of May we usually mow about 60 acres of hay for first cut 
haylage and put that in the silo. In the middle of June we do a little bit of small square bales, but not 
more than 1,000 or 1,500 square bales total.  End of July we just keep rotating cows. Usually the second 
cutting I will get grazed, but then we usually have one field that we hire a guy to mow it, round bale, and 
wrap it. We use that wrapped haylage to feed when the pastures really get dry by the end of July and 
early August. But we never run out of grazing. We will always graze at night time, but sometimes the 
cows will eat round bales outdoors during the day. As far as cropping, we put fences up around where 
we took the first cutting, and it’s the end of September when we start the corn cut. We chop all of our 
corn for silage and put it into 2 silos.  
7 
 
(0:22:44) 
HH: How did you work out the system that you use for crop rotation? 
JS: I guess it hasn’t changed too much from when my father was here. The fields are in corn for 3 to 4 
years. Then you get the alfalfa fields when they start getting not as good for hay. It’s about a 5 year 
rotation when we turn them over and seed them down. A corn field that has been in corn for 4 years, it 
usually gets seeded down the fifth year, usually the fourth year. If a hay field isn’t doing so well for 
production, we will plow it up and put corn on it. 
(0:23:33) 
HH: What about your pasture system? 
JS: All of it has been in the rotation where it will be turned into corn. It usually doesn’t get grazed until 
the second year after a seeding or it will be grazed just the second cutting or just the third cutting. The 
following year it is never usually just the first cutting, because that is our main 20 acres that is always 
grazed. In the past it has been cropped with corn. 
(0:24:20) 
HH: All of your animals are registered Holsteins, is this the original herd you grew up with? 
JS: Yeah. 
HH: Are you still keeping track of the genetics and using artificial insemination? 
JS: Yup. I breed the cows myself and select bulls that are from good cow families, primarily if you look at 
the type traits, we don’t really get too crazy about high milk bulls, but we do watch their components. I 
like to breed our cows to bulls with good protein and fat components. I think that has helped some in 
the cheese making. 
(0:25:10) 
HH: Are you changing anything now that you are making cheese? 
JS: We are not going to switch our herd to Jerseys or Brown Swiss or something, but we will continue to 
breed for the percent fat, percent protein components. We have been more diligent in somatic cell 
counts. We used to run between 150 and 200 thousand somatic cell, which is very low on average, we 
always got super milk awards and everything, but since we started making cheese, Sue can see a big 
difference the way her rennet sets and the way the curds feel if we are well down under 100 thousand 
somatic cells, so that is where we have been staying. The bacteria has always been real low in the past 
and we keep that real low, too. It has kind helped us because the Co-op premiums are a lot higher when 
you stay under 100 thousand for somatic cell. 
(0:26:14) 
8 
 
HH: What do you modify to keep it lower? 
JS: We got rid of a couple of favorite cows that are unusually high somatic cell count cows. We do maybe 
a better job when cows freshen; we will keep the milk out for even a little bit longer, because that first 
milk, even for 3 or 4 days can be a little higher in somatic cell just as she is starting to milk after being 
dry for a couple of months. 
(0:26:47) 
HH: For both of you, how much of knowledge that you are drawing on today is practical knowledge that 
you learned from your parents verses knowledge you learned in school? 
SS: All my knowledge comes from hands-on life skills. 
JS: A lot of what I learned at college is from when I was in extra programs where we spend time on other 
farms. Even after I was home at the farm, we had a grazing group for awhile and we’d go to other farms 
and kind of copy what has worked well for them. It did help me a lot when I was growing up because I 
used to relief milk for a dozen different farms and I could tell the type of farm I didn’t want to have and 
farms I really enjoyed working at and you kind of copy what they do. 
(0:28:04) 
HH: In terms of caring for the animals and breeding them, is that something you learned growing up 
here from your dad, or picking up from other farmers? 
JS: I took a breeding school after I was home on the farm because I wanted to breed myself. The feeding, 
I guess I am not sure; it’s kind of the way I grew up. When I got out of college I started buying protein 
separate and  corn separate and got my own minerals, and it was way too, I was making some more 
milk, but it is a lot of extra steps to take, and we have gotten back to the basics of buying a complete 
feed with everything in it. 
(0:29:15) 
HH: You seem to have a very peaceful attitude and don’t seem stressed out. 
SS: That’s our goal. I think a lot of it is because we didn’t add more cows and get all worked up and, 
“What are we going to do and how are we going to do it?” If you get more cows you have to hire more 
people because we can’t do it. 
JS: Then your bulk tank is not big enough. 
SS: It just mushrooms. 
JS: You have to rent more land. 
(0:30:04) 
9 
 
HH: Have you seen that happen to your friends and other farmers? 
JS: I was on a co-op board. We have a local co-op, and we were members, and I was on the board of 
directors. We would have people that would double their herd size and then call the co-op that you 
have to pick up my milk every milking because I don’t have a bulk tank big enough to hold my milk. And 
these are very intelligent farmers. When I added to the barn and started to milk more cows, we added a 
bigger tank before we did that, because we don’t want to have to get picked up every day, let alone 
every milking. So, it’s a different mindset. We’re content with having a good life maybe, rather than... 
SS: Farming is a way of life, it’s not only who we are. It’s a part of our life. 
JS: And even with our cheese business we made a decision right off the bat that if we are not enjoying it 
we are not going to continue to do it. We sell out every time we make it through the summer, so people 
say make it another day. And we could, but we did when we had a smaller vat and we were making it 3 
times a week, and it was taking too much out of us, and so we— 
SS: With chores and crops and everything else in the busy season it’s too much. 
JS: So we got our bigger vat so we could go back to twice a week and we’ll never go 3 times a week on a 
regular basis with a bigger vat. ‘Cause then, when it gets to be something you don’t enjoy, then it’s not 
worth doing. 
SS: We’re fighting more, and I’m short tempered with him, and we don’t have time for this, and enough. 
(0:32:04) 
HH: It seems like many of the farmers that have expanded, they expressed to me that they had to, it was 
their only choice. You are making it work for your family economically, how do you think you managed 
to do that? Have you ever felt that you will ever need to expand? 
SS: I think a lot of it has to do with his financial skills. Before we even met, he wasn’t into debts to where 
he would never see the light of day, and he didn’t have a choice. He made some pretty smart decisions 
starting out that he didn’t have to have the new tractor, the one he had was just fine, and we still have 
it. 
JS: Machinery is a big investment. We had debt, we had an average of 3 to 3500 dollars of debt per cow, 
which is average, it’s not low I don’t think, at all. So we had debt, but like Sue said, we were never out 
buying any new equipment. Maybe part of it is that we don’t mind working 7 days a week, where I think 
some guys I went to college with kind of felt like they wanted to come home to a farm and 
SS: Have a 9 to 5. 
JS: Yeah, manage people rather than farm. But like Sue said, you get into that vicious cycle where they 
think they have to milk more cows, so then you need more hired labor, and then you need more land, 
and it’s…I don’t know. 
10 
 
SS: And more grain and more this. I don’t understand, if you can’t do it on a small farm, how is the 
bigger scale of it going to make it better, I don’t get it. 
JS: Your largest farms, what it really amounts to is there’s 50 to 70 cows per worker, whether it’s our 
size or 2000 cows, I think if you figure it out, it’d be in that range of cows per worker. Some think they’re 
up at 100, but when you figure in the people that are hauling your manure and hiring the tractor trailers, 
if you are hiring out all your young, the baby calves go somewhere else to be raised for awhile and 
different stuff like that. But I don’t know, I mean, I know what you mean. I was on the Co-op Board with 
some other young farmers, and they feel that they have to keep adding cows to make a living, and I 
can’t tell where they are coming from as far as their debt load and that type of thing, but in a way we’ve 
been fortunate to stay at this size, but I think it’s… A big thing is the spending, I mean we feel we live 
really good, but we’ve never had the new big pickup trucks. When we bought the cheese vat . . . 
SS: . . . that was our pickup. 
(0:36:24) 
HH: But that has turned out so far to be a really good investment? 
JS: Yeah. 
SS: Absolutely. 
(0:36:30) 
HH: You make really careful decisions about machinery. Are you maintaining it and doing the mechanical 
work? 
JS: As far as maintenance, we try to keep it up in good shape, and when we use it, we try not use it hard. 
I think when you hire people that you don’t know— 
SS: If it’s not theirs, they don’t take a good interest.  
JS: And when I have like my father or Sue’s father operating the chopper, it’s different than having some 
kid from downtown running it, and he just wants to get done. 
HH: Well, it’s their children’s livelihood. 
JS: Yeah, so. And we’re fortunate in that respect having her father and my father like to come and help. 
(0:37:14) 
HH: How would you describe your relationship to your animals? 
JS: You know, we’ve showed them in the past, but even the ones that don’t go to the fair, they’re still 
all…they’re all named. We have favorites; we have some that aren’t favorites [laughter]. We don’t like to 
see them uncomfortable because we know then that they’re not gonna be able to produce as much milk 
11 
 
for us. But we understand that when a cow gets to a certain age or she is not as productive, I’m  not 
saying it’s easy to let them go, but we don’t hold on to them. I can remember growing up that the old 
cow would stay around forever. Even when I first started farming for a few years, if you have a cow that 
has trouble calving, and you try and try and try, and she’d down, and you still try and try and it’s... I 
don’t wait as long as I used to to let her go. I guess the big thing is we cut our losses. We still use the vet, 
we call a vet for things we need, and we have a herd check once in a while, but we don’t call them to 
stand for the fingers when the cow’s looking at you funny or whatever. I think that’s a big expense I 
think some people get wrapped up in; when you’re talking about some of the technology that we 
haven’t been jumping on the band wagon, a lot of people, the cow will calve, they give them shots to 
bring them back into heat, and out of sync and all of this, and we just let them come in heat normally. I 
think when you get wrapped up in all these programs, you vet’s always involved and it adds extra 
expenses. 
(0:39:32) 
HH: Extra expenses and more on your plate. 
SS: A healthy cow will do it herself; don’t give her shots. 
JS: And now they…there’s a big farmer, a friend of mine on Facebook, he’s the calving person there. And 
they induce 20 cows at a time to have their babies all at once so he’ll be there. 
SS: How natural is that? 
HH: Right, what could wrong. 
JS: We’re not organic because we do spray our corn for weeds, and use a little bit of fertilizer for the 
corn and stuff, but some of the drug use, and I’m not saying it is terrible, it doesn’t make the milk bad 
and all of that stuff, we just rather not use it. 
(0:40:36) 
HH: What do you use to care for your cows, such as vaccines? 
JS: We dry treat all the cows when they dry off. We don’t vaccinate. That is something I’m kind of torn, I 
don’t know if it is a necessity to vaccinate. This year we didn’t, and the vets…and I think they’re kind of 
driven by the drug companies that are supporting them, that now they’ve got you vaccinating 2 or 3 
times a year, and or boosters all the time. Maybe it is too confusing for me to keep up with so I just 
don’t do it. But as far as cow health, we dehorn the calves; they get milk replacer instead of whole milk 
just because it’s easier for us. Bronson can feed the calves right when he comes out, it’s not like you 
have to have, we haven’t started milking so there is not warm milk to feed them, so we feed milk 
replacer. But other vet work, we have herd check just to do pregnancy checks, and that’s mainly for 
cows that I haven’t seen in heat for awhile so I kind of to find out where they’re at. Sometimes I wonder 
even how much they—I know they know a lot, but I will say I haven’t seen this cow in heat for a while, 
and he’ll check her, “Oh, give her a shot, PF2 in 2 weeks,” and the next day she’s in heat, so…  
12 
 
SS: If we have a down cow or something like that, he’ll give bottles of dextrose and stuff like that. 
JS: I can give calcium in the vein and all that stuff. 
SS: So that helps. 
(0:42:46) 
HH: Does your son like working on the farm? How does he feel about the whole thing? 
JS: He’s not so much…he has some of his favorite animals, some of his favorite calves. But I don’t think 
as far as the whole animal thing, he’d rather be outdoors.  
SS: He’ll be the crop man. 
JS: Growing up, I was into the cows and my  youngest brother was, but my older brother Mike was 
totally machinery and my middle brother Jim was totally get out of the farm. 
(0:43:33) 
HH: What is the relationship among farmers in the area; has that changed since you grew up and what 
role do other farmers play in your life? 
JS: I think still information shared, like the Cooperative Extension has Shop Meetings once month on 
Friday they meet at a farm, you don’t have to make reservations, and you just show up. I think that’s a 
good type of meeting. And then there’s groups of farmers, they meet, but the biggest thing that I’ve 
seen changed since I was growing up, my parents would organize a dairy trip to go to Canada and tour 
farms, and they’d be gone a couple of days. My parents would go to the Farm Bureau Annual Meeting in 
Albany and be gone for 2 or 3 days. My grandparents would come and watch us while we did the chores. 
But now you don’t see farmers get away like they used to, even to serve on boards and stuff; it’s hard to 
get young farmers to serve on a board because they’re so busy with their own chores, and if they have 
kids they’re in every sport imaginable. Even Sue and I haven’t been to a Farm Bureau Annual Meeting 
just ‘cause I don’t feel like we could get away for that long, but we do…maybe it’s ‘cause we don’t want 
to [laughter]. ‘Cause we do, we have been taking weekends and trying to get away. And we have a relief, 
a retired farmer that milks for us, so we’ll always leave a Friday after cheese and then come back Sunday 
or something and travel, even if it is just out to the Finger Lakes or we went down to Lancaster a few 
weeks ago, so we’ve been doing a lot better about getting away and doing that. 
SS: But there again, we are not so big that we would have to hire 5 different people to do it, too. My dad 
comes and does the chores and feeding, the other gentleman will milk, so. 
JS: Everything’s covered. 
(0:46:36) 
HH: What about the role of your farm in the broader or the local community? [phone rings; Sue gets up 
to answer and has a conversation with a customer about picking up cheese from the stand.] 
13 
 
 
JS: I’d like to think we’re a good tool to show people how nice farming can be. This past summer we had 
a family farm day here on our farm, and I think we had over 400 people, or more than that. They had 
parking across the road, we were making cheese, the Dairy Princess was here, we had  little educational 
exhibits for kids that was put on by Farm Bureau and Cooperative Extension. It was a nice turn out and I 
think that was good place for somebody to be able to show…kind of what…’cause fewer and fewer 
people are coming from farms nowadays, and kids just love coming in the barn, and we actually had a 
cow there, and they could touch her, and the vet was there telling people about the cow and stuff. 
[Sue’s conversation continues.] That’s one thing with the cheese business, it’s nice having it here on the 
farm, but we always like going out and help people. The regulars come and they’re in and out, but if we 
see a car come in and they are there for a while, we have to go out, and I like to most of the time if they 
have any questions. A lot of times it is somebody that has questions and it turns into some real good 
opportunity to get our cheese into another store or some restaurant or something, so. 
(0:48:45) 
HH: Has the honor system worked for you? 
JS: Yup; we’re in a community I think that is good for something like that, but I also think that people are 
coming all the way in the driveway and come into the building, it is not like it is a roadside stand out 
front on a table where people pull over.  
[HH pauses recording.] 
I always wonder, are we doing something wrong, or is something going to end up creeping up on us that 
we’re not doing something right because we just have a small farm and some kind of people pick on us 
about having a hobby farm and stuff, but… I don’t know what it is; people feel they have to milk more 
cows to make it rather than maybe cutting back on the cows and doing a better job with what you have. 
I guess that is the big thing, watching expenses than just trying to increase revenue. 
(0:49:57) 
HH: What is your average milk production per cow? 
JS: We are right around 21,000 pounds a cow. So it’s like breed average, about average. We strive for 
real good quality milk, and we always have because your premiums are better at the Co-op. 
(0:50:24) 
HH: So you’re not doing all these things that other farmers are doing to get milk production up, like with 
specific feeding and things like that? 
JS: Right, we just keep it simple. Like I said when I started, there was a separate protein mix, a separate 
corn mix, well then you’ve got bins of this and bins of that, and you’re always trying to adjust things, and 
14 
 
when you really think about it, when the cows go on grass, they’re eating all kinds of different stuff, 
they’re not eating the exact same thing. 
(0:51:05) 
HH: What is the most challenging aspect or aspects of farming for both of you? 
JS: For me, because I read a lot of articles and I was involved with our milk co-op as far as milk pricing, 
the most frustrating thing for me is to see that these farmers, they’re working so hard, and producing an 
awesome product, especially in New York State right now it’s in such a high demand because of the 
yogurt and Great Lakes Cheese doubled their size, and then there’s no result in a higher price because of 
higher demand. And I think it has to do with these big milk co-ops, whether their board of directors are 
blind to it or don’t care, but the management seems to make deals to the handlers to get cheap milk, 
and the farmers will probably take what they’ll take, I think that’s their mentality. Because growing up, 
our co-op board met with Kraft and negotiated a price, and when some other little co-op got a better 
deal from something, our co-op could go to Kraft and say, “Hey, these guys are getting paid, what can 
we do?” And Kraft would give us a little premium. Kraft used to pay all the somatic cell and quality 
premiums because they knew what an advantage to having better quality milk was; lower somatic cell 
they’re making better cheese or having a higher yield. Well now it’s one big dairy co-op has the contract 
for Kraft and Great Lakes Cheese and Chobani Yogurt and little co-ops aren’t in existence anymore, so 
there’s no competition. That is my biggest frustration and that is why we make our own cheese and try 
to get more of our milk into that and not worry about…because I don’t think there is any way to fix what 
is going on right now because they’re so big. 
(0:53:30) 
HH: I was going to ask if there is a solution to that? 
JS: There’s a law suit getting started, a class action lawsuit. And actually in the southeastern United 
States, farmers sued these big co-ops and they actually got paid 160 million dollars. In addition to that 
there was rules saying there has to be some type of competition or less of a monopoly, and that has just 
begun in the Northeast and hopefully—it’s such a long process for something like that—maybe 3 to 5 
years down the road they’ll end of settling up here. A company as big as Kraft or as big as Great Lakes, 
they just want a quick, cheap supply of milk, and these big co-ops, one advantage they do have is a 
weekend that Kraft wants to shut down for a Sunday night to clean stuff, Kraft doesn’t have to take in 
that milk, and the co-op will move it somewhere else for that one day. Where before, all the milk our co-
op made had to go to Kraft, if they wanted to shut down, they had to find a home for that milk. That is 
the problem with milk, it gets made every day, and you can’t keep it, you can’t store it somewhere. 
(0:54:02) 
HH: Your co-op is Agri-Mark? 
JS: We are with Agri-Mark now, we were with the Lowville Co-op, which is with Dairylea, and that’s what 
we wanted to get away from. Agri-Mark, all of our milk goes to plants that Agri-Mark owns, so at the 
15 
 
end of the year the profits they make, they actually return back to the farmers. We couldn’t be happier 
with our decision to go to Agri-Mark. They make you feel like it is your product, Cabot and McCadam 
Cheese. 
(0:55:40) 
HH: Someone else I spoke to said you have the option to purchase the cheese and the butter? 
JS: Twice a year they have a sale where you can buy it right at cost. Like a brick of cheese that costs, 
their Cabot Vintage that’s $14 in the store, we can buy it for $7 or $8. You have to pre-order it, and it’s 
just twice a year, but it’s a pretty good opportunity.  
(0:56:16) 
HH: What about you Sue, is there something that is sort of challenging? 
SS: May not necessarily in addition to his, the milk and dairy, but import/export regulations are so out of 
whack. Anything coming in can pretty much be spoiled or junk. Anything going out has to be just so. 
HH: You mean nationally, coming into the country. 
SS: Fruit, vegetables, meats. 
JS: It seems like China or the European Community will put bans on us sending stuff there on a drop of a 
hat, but we would never do that ‘cause that would interrupt foreign associations or something. 
SS: Don’t hurt their feelings or something. 
JS: ‘Cause there’s a lot of milk products that get imported, like the milk protein concentrates. They’re 
put into the poor cheeses. They’re imported, and they’re really not regulated as far as the safety of 
them. 
HH: That gets put into yogurt as well? 
JS: Now some MPCs are good because they’re made domestically; we’re starting to make some 
domestically, like I think Agri-Mark has protein concentrates they add, but when  you see a processed 
cheese with MPCs it is probably  not very good.  
(0:58:05) 
HH: What do you do with the whey that is produced when making cheese? 
JS: It all goes down to our Amish neighbor. He has a wagon with a big tote and he brings it here first 
thing in the morning. And about noon when we’re done he comes and picks it up and feeds it to his pigs. 
That’s a good service to us because we don’t have to worry about, it used to be the old cheese plants 
would dump in the river, dump it somewhere and get in trouble. We can put it into our gutter system 
16 
 
and into our manure spreader and we can spread it, but it’s such a good feed value to his pigs. Then in 
the spring he gives us 3 little piglets because we raise our own pigs, so it works good for both of us. 
(0:58:55) 
HH: What are some of the most enjoyable or satisfying aspects of dairy farming for both of you? 
JS: I guess the biggest thing is we work as a family together. If tomorrow is going to be a sunny hot 80 
degree day, we can say, “Well, let’s bust out chores early and we’ll go to camp.” If we get a milker, 
great, we’ll stay there at night; we have that freedom; that’s the biggest thing. We know that if it is the 
season when you have to get your first cutting in to be timely and good quality, we would do a first 
cutting first. So we know what has to be done, but there’s an awful lot of time when we can take 
advantage of not having a day job. 
SS: Sort of. My favorite part’s in the spring when they are going out on grass and it is just so green and 
pretty. They’re all out there just munching. They’re like us, what a nice day. 
JS: After we let our cows out, we are coming into the barn, everything is quiet and all you hear is these 
cows in the pasture just munching away at the grass. 
SS: What’s wrong with that? 
(0:50:24) 
HH: Do you not buy the contention that cows are just as happy in a barn year round, which is what I 
have been told by some, that they’re even happier in a barn because there are these great systems and 
ventilation and outside they’re out in the hot sun? 
SS: But we have shade trees and, you know, life is good here. 
JS: I saw a study somewhere that the cows had the freedom to go, whether it was in the free stall or 
outdoors, and they were still outdoors a higher percentage of time except that time when it’s real hot. 
But they had food in the free stall, so they’d come and eat food in the free stall. 
SS: But they’re getting exercise, fresh air, sunshine. 
JS: They’re so clean. And we feel bad because from mid-October until the end of April, our cows are in 
the barn and we wish they could get some exercise and all that. It’d be too time consuming to do. 
Where in a nice free stall barn they are able to walk around all the time and it’s a lot better for them to 
walk around all the time. In the summer when there’s grass and pasture and sod, you just can’t beat 
that environment, even with a beautiful, beautiful air-conditioned free stall barn. 
SS: If we’ve got something going on, like the vet’s coming, or we hold them in, they throw fits. They start 
bellering, it’s like, you know, “Let’s go here.” So…definitely outside. 
JS: The one thing I like about some free stalls now they are installing these rubbers and stuff where the 
cow can go underneath it and when they hit it activates . . . 
17 
 
HH: . . . those big brushes. 
JS: I think that is a really good idea because when our cows go out to pasture they get so clean. 
HH: Because they are rubbing themselves against, what, the trees? 
JS: Maybe. They lick each other. 
SS: The wind blows through their hair. 
JS: The rain. They’re much better on pasture, that’s the number 1 ideal, I think. 
(1:02:57) 
HH: Are you controlling everything that is growing in the area they pasture? 
JS: We let it be a native grass. We seed down with alfalfa, a couple grass mixes, but then after about 3 
years, a lot of native grasses are coming in, and that’s actually, I think, the best pasture is native grasses. 
They do pick and choose what species they’re looking for that day. It’s like some days whether you’d 
rather have a bowl of lettuce or a turkey sandwich or something. They have different cravings I think.  
(1:03:37) 
HH: What is your favorite season on the farm? 
SS: Definitely spring. 
JS: Yeah, it’d be spring, early summer because… I like harvesting in the fall, but then you’re always 
thinking, “I gotta get this put away, that put away, what’s gonna go here….” When you get cows out in 
the spring, let the heifers out, the barn’s empty and chores are like almost nothing, you know. 
(1:04:17) 
HH: In your own experience, what have been the biggest changes you two have experienced, especially 
in terms of what you’re actually doing, what your work is? 
JS: That’s what we’ve always strived to, is to make things easier. Growing up we still had silo unloaders, 
which throws the silage down into your cart, but then we wheel it out in front of the cows and fork it to 
all the cows. Now we have a big barrel mixer in the feed room, the silage comes in the mixer, the grain 
comes in the mixer, you mix it up, and we have a power cart that I drive underneath the feed mixer, fill 
that up, and go around and feed with a power cart. And also, with the heifers and young stock, we used 
to have some young stock here, you have to feed them with a wheel barrow, some young stock here, 
and you have to carry this to them, now everything is right where we can do it. The hand work is a lot 
less than it used to be. 
SS: That would be the same as we did growing up, ‘cause we had more cows, but--  
18 
 
JS: They’d milk their barn full, kick them out, and then bring in another group to milk another group. We 
used to do that here. We had a third row with 10 more cows. You’d get done milking the upper part, you 
bring those 10 over and milk them, just a lot of extra time involved. 
(1:06:17) 
HH: How many hours are you putting in each day on average? 
JS: Just strictly chores it’s 2 hours in the morning and hour and a half at night, so 3 and half hours. Even 
with crops, I can remember 10 years ago, we used to mow ‘til midnight and chop all hours of the night 
just to get done, and we don’t do that anymore. Our longest day would be from 5 in the morning ‘til 7 at 
night, it would be 14 hours. 
(1:07:11) 
HH: How was it something that was necessary to do, this chopping until midnight, and now you can get 
away with not doing it?  
JS: I don’t know why. I guess I was just younger and wanted to get it done. Our feed quality is the same 
now. But I don’t know if we do, say 8 hours a day, so it would be 50, 60 hours a week. But during the 
winter time it’s not that. 
(1:08:01) 
HH: Where do you see dairy farming in Lewis County heading? 
JS: We’re a different county than… we’re a very conservative county. We’re fortunate that, and I think 
all the Lewis Country farmers take it for granted, or they don’t realize that this Black River Valley with 
this concentration of farms is like no other until you go to Lancaster, PA or parts of Wisconsin. We’re a 
concentrated number of beautiful farms that all make a good livings, especially when you go across the 
river to the Mennonite families. They have a lot of family help and there’s a lot of small farms over 
there. So I kind of think that maybe the big farms we do have, I don’t know as there’s gonna be a whole 
lot more of them, and I think these family farms will stay right in business. I can tell you, when I was in 
school, from our house to Lowville, it’s two and half miles and there used to be I think 7 dairy farms and 
now it’s just, we’re  the first ones. Now you go up the road again, not until Glennys-Ayres (sp?), so it 
would be another 2 or 3 miles. 
(1:09:43) 
HH: So these farms I passed, they are not necessarily operational? 
JS: Two are Amish, but the first hill you come up there is a nice white one; he rents his whole farm, a 
1000 cow farm, the other side of Lowville. The next hill you come up there is a lot of nice land, and that’s 
all rented by Pecks and Demkos [large farms in the area]. Up the road there is a beautiful farm on you 
left with a lot of machinery, and that is all rented by Marks [another large farm]. So all the land is being 
used, where when I started here in ‘94, I used to rent some land from Leo Demko down here, and it was 
19 
 
10 dollars an acre or 15 dollars an acre, and it was usually available. But now it’s pretty much all taken 
up, and it’s about 60 to 120 dollars an acre for rent because it’s all pretty good land and in demand. 
SS: And the big farms are putting the money into clearing out hedgerows and dig ditches and do tiles 
and stuff like that to get as much as they can. 
(1:11:00) 
HH: So the actual landscape is changing. 
JS: Yeah. 
HH: But you don’t think the land is going to change much more? 
JS: Maybe I’m being optimistic. 
SS: Naïve or optimistic, which… 
HH: It’s interesting you mention the Mennonites though, because their presence if very significant in 
keeping the small farms in operation if they stay. 
JS: I think the Amish are here to stay because they’ve been investing pretty good money in more farm 
land, but these big farms are really looking for land ‘cause they need it to meet their CAFO regulations 
and stuff like that. 
(1:11:50) 
HH: When your son is helping, do you have a particular way that you are trying to teach him? What’s 
your method? 
SS: It depends on the day. [laughter] 
JS: We’ve been trying to instill in him, like when Sue was raised, they worked hard, they milked a lot of 
cows back in a conventional barn. 
SS: For that time, that was a lot. 
JS: But you work hard and you’re always going to have rewards, so we want to try to instill that you 
gotta work hard to play hard. 
SS: And some days you may not want to do it, but you still have to. I can’t forget to feed you, you know. 
(1:12:56) 
HH: Do you have a religious faith? 
JS: We’re Catholic, Sue has different views I think than the Catholic Church. I go to church, I guess mainly 
more ‘cause my father does, and I like to be with him at church. But we’re religious, I guess. 
20 
 
SS: We do believe; we’re not, you know, bad people. [laughter] 
HH: No, I was just curious because, you know, I was just thinking back to a couple of Mennonite dairy 
farmers I’d talked to, and how tied up their faith was with their occupation and I was just curious if your 
Christianity plays any role in your choice to be farmers. 
JS: No, it’s kind of separate. 
SS: But I would like to believe that we’re good people, and some of that has to come from the good 
Lord. So I guess it does go in somewhat, but not nearly to that degree. 
(1:14:22) 
HH: Is there anything you would like to talk about or mention? 
JS: I guess not. With the cheese we had somebody else did an interview and she sent us what she had 
written up, and she said we did the cheese because of the bad year in 2009, and this is how we were 
going to make a living, and that wasn’t really the purpose of the cheese. It was more something to do 
and then after we started doing it and people’d come and just, to see people leave so happy they can 
get fresh cheese curd out of the vat still warm. We had the Jefferson County 4-H was just here this 
morning, and I was telling them that when you see a person come and get it for the first time when it’s 
warm, and they don’t get to the end of the driveway and turn around and comeback and say, “We gotta  
have another bag,” that’s the neatest part of the cheese part of it. We have gotten a kick out of people 
that have gotten that excited about it and enjoy it so much. But it has helped our bottom line 
tremendously, too. Like, the trips we take are more often now because we can afford them from the 
cheese income and stuff we’ve done to make things more comfortable like siding the house or a lot of 
stuff we probably take for granted at this point. 
SS: Like the new cow mats and stuff like that, that probably may not have happened, or as many as we 
put in probably would not have been if we weren’t doing the cheese. 
(1:16:15) 
HH: You said you started the cheese in the house, are you overseeing that? 
JS: She’s the cheese maker. Through the summer we do it twice a week, and it’s pretty much, I’ll get up 
at about 2:30 in the morning, start the boiler to start pasteurizing, and we’ll have it up to pasteurization 
and then cooled by like 5:30. And then from 5:30 to 10:00, she’s in the cheese room and  I do chores 
with Bronson. My father-in-law comes, Sue’s dad comes and helps with chores sometimes now on 
cheese mornings, so it’s pretty much Sue’s in there doing the starter and the rennet and all that stuff, 
but then we work together from 9 ‘til noon. 
HH: Here’s another costumer; I hope there is some left by the time I leave. 
(1:17:26) 
21 
 
HH: Sue, was there anything you wanted to mention? 
SS: Not really. 
HH: Did either of you do 4-H as children? 
SS: He did. 
JS: I was in 4-H, I was real active in 4-H, I was real active in FFA and, we still like to help; I was on the 4-H 
program committee for quite a while. They do a cheese sale and we help them with the cheese curd. I 
volunteer for dairy bowl and stuff like that; I enjoy it, because I got a lot out of it when I was young. 
HH: What is dairy bowl? 
JS: It’s like a quiz bowl competition. The kids practice probably once a week or every other week, and 
then 6 or 8 counties get together in March, and I’m one of the question readers or something. There are 
4 on a team and they have little buzzers and get asked team questions and toss up questions. 
(1:18:48) 
HH: Do you happened to know the date of this year’s? 
JS: I think I wrote it down. 
HH: Is Bronson in 4-H? 
SS: He’s not. 
HH: He doesn’t want to? 
SS: He’s not really into it. 
JS: The 9th or 16th of March. It’s a Saturday. Bronson, he showed for a couple of years, but even like 
showing down there is different than what it used to be when I was growing up. It used to be all the kids 
would get together and they’d have a calf, and now it is you have to have the best calf, and nobody 
really clips, they have fitters do the clipping, and it’s kind of sad. 
HH: Clipping their hair? 
JS: Yeah, it’s like doing make-up on a model. They clip the top lines. 
SS: And there’s certain ones that will go out and buy the winner instead of just pulling something out of 
the barn. I think it is pretty discouraging. 
LS: Last year they had a pheasant program. He got 20 pheasants and we raised them here. That was a lot 
of fun. You raise them and you release them. It was neat because all through fall we would see them 
coming out of the corn or here and there. Tomorrow there is a 4-H fun day, I think Bronson, we sign him 
up for a couple of workshops and we’ll go down to that. But even 4-H isn’t what it used to be when I was 
22 
 
growing up. It used to be, the agent was able to do so much, they had a van, we used to go to dairy 
judging tours at junior college in Morrisville or Cobleskill, and the agent would take all these kids and a 
couple of parents would go, and we used to get out a lot and it was good for the kids to get away from 
home and do that stuff, but now there’s a bunch of constraints. It is not what it used to be, plus kids are 
so involved with sports and everything else, so I think it takes away from it. 
(1:21:05) 
HH: I don’t want to labor this for too long, but how does the funding for 4-H work? 
JS: Partial County and partial from the State. ‘Cause it’s all Cooperative Extension. 
HH: Anything else? 
JS: No, I think we’re all set.
