June 5, 1943, letter from B.A. Botkin to Dr. Willis James
June 5, 1943 Dr. Willis James The Fort Valley State College Fort Valley, Georgia
Dear Dr. James:
As I wrote President Bond, we have extended the Fort Valley recording project to the end
of June. I trust this will fit into your schedule. Could you let me know what your recording
plans are? President Bond mentioned some new war songs by Buster Ezell. We have just
filled a request for Buster Ezell's Bottle Up And Go recorded by John Work a couple of
years ago. Since the record is very noisy and bumpy, I should like to have you rerecord
it with special emphasis on the text. The tendency is to place the guitar too close to the
microphone and drown out the words.
It might also be a good idea for you to rerecord some of the songs which you have already
recorded but which are marred by tangled threads. Perhaps together we can draw up a list
of the best of the titles to be salvaged.
With best wishes,
Faithfully, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
