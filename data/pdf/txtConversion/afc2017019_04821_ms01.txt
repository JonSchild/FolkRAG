MAZIOT, JOANN 
Interviewed by Christopher Sims 
December 20, 2017 
 
MAZIOT: 
00:04 
Oh, I'm shaking. You got me nervous.  
SIMS: 
00:08 
Don't be nervous. Can we start out by ... Can you say your name 
and spell it? 
MAZIOT: 
00:22 
JoAnn Maziot. J-O-A-N-N M-A-Z-I-O-T. 
SIMS: 
00:25 
And where are you from originally? 
MAZIOT: 
00:28 
New York. I was born in Suffern, New York.  
SIMS: 
00:34 
And how did you end up in Louisiana? 
MAZIOT: 
00:36 
Just got tired of it one day and drove down here and stayed.  
SIMS: 
00:40 
Really? 
MAZIOT: 
00:40 
Yeah.  
SIMS: 
00:41 
And how old were you at the time? 
MAZIOT: 
00:42 
36. It was 20 years ago. I liked it, so I stayed.  
SIMS: 
00:48 
How'd you pick Louisiana? Did you have any connection? 
MAZIOT: 
00:52 
My dad said I had to have a destination and opened a map. I 
closed my eyes and pointed and it was Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
That's how I got here.  
SIMS: 
01:04 
And how did you learn about role play? 
MAZIOT: 
01:08 
It's really the only kind of steady work for anybody to do in this 
area. You can work in a gas station or whatever for minimum 
wage and just bust your butt mopping and sweeping and 
loading coolers and dealing with people every day. It's just, it 
wasn't worth it. This was worth it to me.  
SIMS: 
01:38 
Cool. What other types of jobs did you do before role play in the 
area? 
 
2 
MAZIOT: 
01:42 
I waited tables for 30-something years, so. I was hired in 2003 
when Iraq started.  
SIMS: 
01:55 
So, how did you hear about the job, I guess? 
MAZIOT: 
02:00 
Everybody in my community. It was going around. Fort Polk's 
hiring for role play, we're going to war, they need lots of people, 
you need to go put your application in. So, I did.  
SIMS: 
02:13 
What was the interview process like? 
MAZIOT: 
02:18 
Actually, we didn't really have an interview. I had a class for a 
whole week. I had to go sit and they tell you about what the job 
was and you knew if you were going to be able to do it or not. 
Once you get on the box, it'll only take you one day to figure out 
if it's for you or not.  
SIMS: 
02:39 
Right.  
MAZIOT: 
02:40 
A lot of people didn't come back the next day.  
SIMS: 
02:46 
But it sounds like ... So, did you do all right? 
MAZIOT: 
02:48 
Yeah. I loved it. I wish I could go back now.  
SIMS: 
02:52 
So, the people that didn't last, why do you think that was for 
them? 
MAZIOT: 
02:56 
It's a lot of hours and there's, you have to actually get up and do 
stuff. A lot of people thought, "Oh, I'll sit in my chair all day and 
sleep," and it's not like that.  
SIMS: 
03:08 
So, what attracted you to the job? I mean, aside from it being, I 
guess better money. 
MAZIOT: 
03:14 
Trying to help these young guys to learn something before they 
went over there. If I just did one thing to help one soldier in my 
10 years at role play, I'd be happy.  
SIMS: 
03:29 
Did you have any family connection to the military? 
MAZIOT: 
03:32 
No. I wanted to go in the military when I was younger but my 
mom wouldn't let me.  
SIMS: 
03:37 
Why not? 
 
3 
MAZIOT: 
03:41 
My mom, I don't know. There was no war back then. I would 
have been retired and everything right as Iraq started.  
SIMS: 
03:48 
But what was the appeal for you to go in the military? 
MAZIOT: 
03:54 
I wanted to do something with helicopters. I'm still into 
helicopters. I don't know. I can hear them far away, I always go 
out, look at them. I like it. I don't know why.  
SIMS: 
04:09 
So tell me about some of the roles or the identities you had 
during role play.  
MAZIOT: 
04:16 
In Iraq, my name was ... I just had it all on the tip of my tongue 
too this morning. Oh my god. I know Afghan I was Mina, Iraq I 
think I was ... I can't remember her name yet, but I used to do 
scenarios, just different things every day because I liked to role 
play. I always got picked to do something. I didn't like sitting 
around in the village and cooking big meals for everybody. I 
wanted to get out and do. But I've done a lot of different things. 
Weird, some not weird. Some very boring, but.  
SIMS: 
04:57 
Tell me some of the weird ones that you remember.  
MAZIOT: 
05:06 
There are so many. I worked out there 10 years. Oh, here's a 
good one. I got shot by a 50 cal simulation and a soldier came to 
try to help me and the bad guy slit his throat as he was trying to 
help me. The men here in America wear their hearts on their 
sleeves. If a woman's in trouble, they go help them, but over 
there, you can't even look at a woman in her eye. One time a 
soldier looked me in the eye and I had acid thrown on my face. I 
had to walk around with this big bandage on my face for a week 
and stuff and try to get into the FOB to see a doctor. Just stuff 
that goes on over there is totally different than the way we live 
here. I'm glad I live in America. I don't know if I could do that 
every day, but if I knew no different, I don't know if it would 
phase me. But my main thing was to try to help some of these 
guys because you see repeat offenders, people that are coming 
back to go back over there and they were just not the same 
from the first time. They were totally different.  
SIMS: 
06:22 
In what way? 
MAZIOT: 
06:24 
Mostly in their head, you know? If a simulated bomb went off, 
they just like would be trying to go somewhere or hit the floor, 
so to speak, or always nervous. Come back with ADHD, so they 
say. They couldn't stop talking. They leave real quiet, but they 
 
4 
come back and they won't shut up. You're like, "Dude, just sit 
down." Just, their personalities wouldn't be the same.  
SIMS: 
06:53 
So, you would recognize and see people after a couple of years? 
MAZIOT: 
06:58 
Yeah.  
SIMS: 
06:58 
Yeah?  
MAZIOT: 
07:00 
Yeah.  
SIMS: 
07:00 
That sounds ... 
MAZIOT: 
07:02 
Some, like the Tenth Mountain 509th, they actually stay here 
with us and then they get deployed and when they come back, 
they're just totally different people. They'd stay with us out in 
box, live with us just like some of them were role players, some 
of them were the bad guys, and they would stay in our villages 
with us the whole entire two weeks or three weeks we were out 
there. You get to know a person. You're out there, we're 
scheduled for 12 hours, but a lot of days it was 16 hours.  
SIMS: 
07:33 
Right.  
MAZIOT: 
07:34 
Just because it's 6:00 to 6:00, if there's something going on at 
6:00, you just didn't, "Oh, sorry," pack your stuff and go home, 
you had to finish the whole scenario. So, sometimes you were 
there 14, 16 hours a day. After 18 hours a day, they had to give 
you a day off the next day. I guess the working laws or 
whatever, so they'd try to keep us under the 18 hours. But then 
again, you've got to go home and do what you have to do at the 
house. Wash your clothes, pack some food, whatever it is that 
you have to do and you have to go back and do it again the next 
day. Sometimes you only got four or five hours at night to do 
what you had to do. And that went on ... 2003 we used to work 
22 days a month. Now I hear it's 7, 14.  
SIMS: 
08:26 
Days a month? 
MAZIOT: 
08:27 
Yeah. Like a half a rotation. Key players work maybe two weeks, 
but everybody else is only working one week. 
SIMS: 
08:41 
So, was it sort of ... Sounds like really good money though if 
you're working 22 days a month at that many hours.  
MAZIOT: 
08:54 
Back then I made good money. I retired in 2013 because of an 
accident I had out there and it wasn't that great then.  
 
5 
SIMS: 
09:09 
Because there's less hours? 
MAZIOT: 
09:10 
A lot less hours, yeah. We only worked 7 or 14 days a month if 
we worked every month. When the war first started it was just 
plentiful. I paid off my house, I bought a new truck. It was just 
nice. But then, as everything winds down, like it is now, it's not 
... The beginning of any war, it's the same old war. A lot of these 
men have been there and done that two, three, four times. 
They only deploy so many. In the beginning they were deploying 
everybody. Everybody had to be trained of some kind and this 
is, from my understanding, this is the only kind of training they 
have here at Fort Polk or somewhere in California, I believe.  
SIMS: 
09:58 
Right.  
MAZIOT: 
09:59 
There's only two places that really do this. Which, they need 
something. Okay. Their culture, I say it different, culture, am I 
saying it right? 
SIMS: 
09:59 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
MAZIOT: 
10:09 
... is totally different from what we know. Like that one guy, he 
got his throat slit because he tried to help me because I was 
shot. Now, that's something here you do, but you can't touch a 
woman, you can't even look a woman in their eyes. And we had 
to wear garb. Just our hands and our eyes could show through 
this thing they called garb. It was horrible. Over your regular 
clothes. In the summer it gets hot here.  
SIMS: 
10:42 
Right.  
MAZIOT: 
10:44 
I've been to funerals where you grab your hair and pull your hair 
and beat your chest and ... like scream and cry. It's just totally 
different. Here, you all gather, have coffee, and go out to eat. 
Celebrate. Celebration of life.  
SIMS: 
11:07 
Like with the funeral, did they teach you how to do ... I mean, 
how did you all know about that stuff? 
MAZIOT: 
11:12 
Well, they have a thing that's called a scenario. These writers 
write scenarios for us and in there it tells you what you're 
supposed to do, how you're supposed to act. The men, the 
females, the males, stuff like that and then the work group 
leader will go over it before you go do it. Let's say, "Okay, you, 
you, and you go in the other room. At this time you're going to 
do this. This is what you're supposed to act like." And you go do 
it.  
 
6 
SIMS: 
11:40 
Was there anything that they asked you to do that seems like, 
too strange to do or too...? 
MAZIOT: 
11:51 
There's a lot of things they asked me to do I thought was weird. 
But, if you watch the news, what we did here was what was 
going on over there.  
SIMS: 
11:59 
What would be some of those things? 
MAZIOT: 
12:03 
Here's another thing that stuck in my head. I was in a village and 
my daughter got run over by a soldier in his Humvee and I asked 
for some kind of reimbursement or payment to bury my 
daughter. All my sons and husbands were killed, or husband, 
was killed already and I didn't have no money or anything. 
Soldiers came back and paid me with two goats and they told 
me a cow is worth more than a daughter in their country ... and 
that I wasn't getting nothing but these two goats.  
SIMS: 
12:45 
And so how did your character react? 
MAZIOT: 
12:50 
Of course I was upset, that was my daughter, the only child I 
had left. All my sons and my husband were killed. How was I 
supposed to live? With two goats? But I took the two goats for 
payment because after I realized, after a OC, observer-
controller, came by and he said, "Take the deal. That's a good 
deal." And I said to him, "Are you kidding me?" He said, "No. A 
cow is worth more than a young girl's life. This is a good price 
for her life." To me, that hurt my heart, but that's how they live 
there. We don't know no different.  
SIMS: 
13:36 
But was there actually somebody there who was your pretend 
daughter? 
MAZIOT: 
13:41 
No, she was killed. She had got runned over.  
SIMS: 
13:44 
No, but did they actually stage that part or did they just ...  
MAZIOT: 
13:48 
No, they didn't. Just one day I walked in to work and they said, 
"You got something you got to do today. There you go, this is 
what you got to do." And they let me read the scenario. After a 
couple of years, you're constantly role playing and doing these 
scenario things. You just kind of know what they expect from 
you and you've got to learn just a few words to get by because 
you can't speak English. Which, if I was in a demonstration, I 
could probably say sentences, but off the top of my head, I just 
know a few words, but when I'm in that doing that, I knew a lot 
more. Everybody would say, "How do you say that?" I was like, 
 
7 
"I don't know." I had to be in the moment, I guess, to spit it out. 
But we had one day of school, Arabic school. We had ... What's 
that song? E-I-E-I-O, what is that song?  
SIMS: 
14:45 
Something with a farmer? 
MAZIOT: 
14:46 
Yeah.  
SIMS: 
14:47 
Old McDonald? 
MAZIOT: 
14:48 
That's it. We had to know that song, before we could pass our 
class, in Arabic. That's how I know josh and khinzir. Khinzir is a 
pig. Josh is a donkey. I used to call the soldiers khinzirs and if a 
soldier was giving me a hard time, I used to call him josh. Hee 
haw, hee haw. Sorry. But a lot of it was harassing them. Here's a 
good thing I remember. I was asking for a mutarjent.  
SIMS: 
15:23 
A what? 
MAZIOT: 
15:24 
A mutarjent. A mutarjent 00:15:23 in Arabic is a translator. 
Someone to translate English into Arabic. I think it was Iraq at 
the time, and I kept on saying mutarjent, and he kept on 
screaming at me in English and I didn't understand what he was 
saying. Finally, he told me, "We don't have no f-ing Tide here, 
lady." And I just started cracking up laughing, but I made it seem 
like I was crying because he cursed at me.  
SIMS: 
15:52 
Right.  
MAZIOT: 
15:53 
So, it made a good day for that, but I found that very funny that 
I was asking for an interpreter and he had no clue what I was 
trying to do. I think he learned that day, he needs an 
interpreter, not no Tide. Some of the stuff is okay because I 
remember the OC came over and said, "Are you offended? Are 
you okay?" I said, "Yeah. I'm laughing." I mean, I was laughing so 
hard I was crying because I found it funny. He said, "Oh, okay." 
But he thought I was really upset. I've got tears in my eyes now 
just thinking about it.  
SIMS: 
16:31 
Yeah. Good actor.  
MAZIOT: 
16:32 
It was funny. I was just asking for a translator.  
SIMS: 
16:39 
Except you had to pretend you couldn't understand what the 
soldier was saying, right? 
 
8 
MAZIOT: 
16:42 
No English ever. Always had to have a buddy. Wherever you 
went, you always had to have another female with you. Women 
don't walk alone over there. They always had to have two. Plus, 
that's an army thing too. There's always two. If you see a plane, 
there's always two. If you see a helicopter- 
MAZIOT: 
17:00 
You know if you see a plane there's always two. You see a 
helicopter there's always two. You see a Chinook there's always 
two. You see soldiers there's always two. Everything goes in 
pairs. You're never alone. No matter what they do you always 
have a buddy. 
SIMS: 
17:24 
What was the hardest part of the job for you? 
MAZIOT: 
17:25 
The hours, the climate, some long, long days. There's days I was 
out there when it was sleeting and snowing, freezing and have 
to stand outside for 14 hours. And there's days it was 116 and I 
had to wear all that garb, you want to die, and talk about stink. 
Nevermind me, the soldiers you're like, oh, the walk by, woof. I 
could go home and take a shower every day, they didn't, you 
could smell them coming. That was basically the bummer. 
MAZIOT: 
18:04 
Then, you know the women, yeah, yeah. Everybody's fight by 
the end of the rotation, who didn't get along with who and who 
said this and ... which I understand there's a lot of that out there 
now, they're not doing much and they just sit around and fight 
all day. 
SIMS: 
18:20 
Yeah, not pretend fighting but like just gossiping? 
MAZIOT: 
18:23 
Like real, yeah. 
SIMS: 
18:24 
Yeah. 
MAZIOT: 
18:25 
I couldn't handle all that.  
SIMS: 
18:26 
So what are they ... what do the gossip about stuff, like about 
work? 
MAZIOT: 
18:31 
Well we all live in the same community, everybody know 
everybody, half of them are related. I don't know how they 
dated in high school, they all go to the same school for 12 years. 
How do you? No, sorry dear, he's your second cousin find 
somebody else. Where I come from we don't do that, we don't 
... well we probably gossip but we're not all related somehow, 
someway. And your grand pappy 50 years ago kicked my 
mother. Okay, I'm out of this. But yeah. 
 
9 
SIMS: 
19:12 
So did you feel sort of outside of that because you're from- 
MAZIOT: 
19:15 
I feel outside, I've been here 20 years, I still feel like an outsider, 
and people remind me I'm an outsider.  
SIMS: 
19:22 
Because of your? 
MAZIOT: 
19:24 
I'm not a Yankee, I'm a damn Yankee, one that's stupid and 
didn't realize to go home. I get that all the time, still after 20 
years I get that. If I was a Yankee I was smart enough to leave 
and go home, I'm a damn Yankee I wasn't smart enough, I'm still 
here. But things are so much cheaper here, I own a house with 
land, I'd never have that up there. People were very nice when I 
came here, it's the same old thing now everywhere. You know 
me first, then you, the drugs, kids stealing, sassing you back, 
shut up old lady, you know? That's everywhere now, it wasn't 
like that when I first moved here. It was always yes ma'am, no 
ma'am, you'd go any where and get nice conversation and a cup 
of coffee. It's not like that anymore here either, so. 
SIMS: 
20:15 
So when did that change, do you know? 
MAZIOT: 
20:18 
I guess over the 20 years. You know I got all new neighbors, 
they're all young kids and they know better than me, so. 
SIMS: 
20:25 
When you were at Fort Polk during the role play, did you ... 
what changed over that, you were there 10 years, like what 
changed over that 10 years? 
MAZIOT: 
20:41 
I think it's a good think but lack of water, it wasn't so big and we 
used to have all kinds of rotations, Bosnia. Then we had stuff for 
the United States too.  
SIMS: 
20:58 
Like what kind of? 
MAZIOT: 
21:00 
We have scenarios for United States in case something 
happened here. You know we had different, not just Iraq and 
Afghanistan. When the wars were more prominent ... is that 
what I'm looking for ... in Afghanistan and Iraq it was all that, 
but when it was switching from Iraq, we were pulling out of Iraq 
and then we're going back to Afghanistan we'd do Bosnia, I 
guess Africa, is that Bosnia? 
SIMS: 
21:30 
Different but they're probably close. 
MAZIOT: 
21:36 
We did a couple for America, I can't remember what they're 
called. They were called different, something different too. 
 
10 
SIMS: 
21:43 
What would you do for the American ones? I mean you play an 
English speaking? 
MAZIOT: 
21:49 
Yeah, yourself, wear your own colors, you'd be yourself. You all 
have some kind of role. In the beginning you get a piece of 
paper, it says your role, your name and then what you believe in 
your religion, if you're a working person what you do for work. 
You get a general background of this person that you're 
portraying, and you got to go home and just kind of study that 
so if you do get questioned or you do get sent out for a scenario 
or something you actually have to know this stuff.  
MAZIOT: 
22:23 
Like Iraq and Afghanistan these guys would really interrogate 
you and you had to know this stuff or you'd get detained. They 
throw you in this little three by six room and you could be there 
a long time. With no food or cigarettes or you have to beg to go 
to the bathroom, if they knocked on the door you had to stick 
your face up against the wall. Just like you're over there. You 
know, you didn't want to get detained, so you wanted to know 
your information. If you were Sunni, Shia or ... 
MAZIOT: 
22:59 
America is more relaxed, more like humanity, you know 
humanitarian stuff. It was more like that. We went to Fort Hood 
once and did, we went to Seattle, Washington once and did role 
play there. I actually didn't go because I have responsibilities 
here I couldn't take two weeks off and just go. But you know 
different stuff, and it was a decent living. You could work and 
then have time off, you work your butt off for good money and 
then you'd have a week off, two weeks off, sometimes two 
months off. We had always block leave in December and July. 
So December you use your most your holidays and July I'd go 
back to New York and visit my parents.  
SIMS: 
24:04 
Did you have other work? At the same time.  
MAZIOT: 
24:06 
They say you can collect unemployment when you're not 
working but it got to be such a hassle it just wasn't worth it. For 
the little bit of money, what they required, and then they send 
you letters saying you had to pay them back because you 
claimed work when you working when you weren't. It just 
turned into a big deal, everybody stopped collecting. 
SIMS: 
24:31 
But did people generally do other work or? 
MAZIOT: 
24:36 
Mostly it was elder retired teachers, that never paid into state 
tax, they were looking for quarters to retire, to get a retirement 
check. A lot of school teachers, principles and stuff, all a lot of 
 
11 
elderly people, 70s late 60s, 70s, a lot. When I started, I don't 
know what's out there now. 
MAZIOT: 
24:58 
Now they're looking for more younger I think gentlemen to 
portray training Iraqi policemen, IP, ANP, IP whatever it is now, 
and stuff like that.  
SIMS: 
25:16 
Did the sort of older retired folks and the younger role players, 
did the interact a lot or get along? 
MAZIOT: 
25:24 
No. Yeah, everybody got along, but in the beginning it was more 
like ... the elders, the village elders and sitting down and talking 
to them. What do they need? What can the American soldiers 
do for them? Can they pick out the Taliban or the bad person? 
Then at the end of the wars it was training young men to 
become policemen and soldiers. So like the roles switched up.  
SIMS: 
25:55 
Was there a lot of interaction between the cultural role players, 
like from Iraq and Afghanistan and the- 
MAZIOT: 
26:06 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). They live with us, just like everybody 
else. 
SIMS: 
26:09 
How did those groups get along? 
MAZIOT: 
26:13 
I don't know. I mean we had some problems with them too, but 
it's kind of scary, they're learning our army. How do you know 
they're not going to go say something over there? In the 
beginning that's the way I felt, like how do I know they're not 
going to go back to Iraq or talk to daddy on the phone in 
Afghanistan and give out information that they don't need.  
MAZIOT: 
26:40 
There's some lanes that I work, IED lanes, I had to sign papers 
from the FBI that I would never speak about it at that time, or 
post anything on Facebook, or what we did. You know? 
MAZIOT: 
26:57 
So I don't know, I found them to be nice. Most of them were 
nice, people just like us, looking for something to do. Some of 
them were doctors and lawyers and it wasn't recognized here 
so they were out role playing just like me. In the rain, in the 
mud, in the cold, in the hot, and here is a woman doctor 
standing next to me from Iraq because it's the only kind of work 
she could find here.  
MAZIOT: 
27:34 
A lot of people won't even sit next to them, I was in DMV about, 
in November I had to get my new handicap plates and stuff, the 
whole row was empty with one Iraqi woman, she had just the 
 
12 
head garb on, not the whole thing, and a young son. I went and 
sat next to her, nobody else would, the whole place was 
packed. She's a person just like us, what's the deal? 
SIMS: 
28:04 
Do you think coming from New York has you think about things 
a little bit differently than the local people? 
MAZIOT: 
28:13 
Oh yeah, I'm totally...the people down here, yeah. Nobody was 
American up there when I was growing up. Everybody had a 
green card or whatever. So it doesn't bother me down here.  
MAZIOT: 
28:27 
Some black guy yesterday was looking to clean somebody's 
carpets and everybody freaked out on my road, no black people 
come back here. God forbid. They called the cops. In New York 
it's no big deal. Everybody's different color, race, whatever, 
were just people. Yeah, I'm totally different, I dress different, 
talk different. Yeah, I'm different, definitely.  
SIMS: 
28:59 
So what did you do for food out there? Did you ... You said 
earlier you didn't like pigs.  
MAZIOT: 
29:06 
We had to bring food with us everyday. Certain times of the 
year you brought certain things. Like in the winter you bring 
candy in case you get too cold, you eat candy, it helps you warm 
up or whatever. You always had to have a change of clothes and 
you always had to have food.  
MAZIOT: 
29:25 
Like me I didn't sit in the village all day, and the older women 
they sit in the kitchen all day and talk about everybody and 
make food. I used to say they're stirring ugly in our food, that's 
why you're all fighting.  
MAZIOT: 
29:39 
But, you always had to have food with you. Whatever, like I 
always packed two sandwiches, fruit, whatever, a bag of chips, 
whatever I wanted. And I'd have the big lunch box and it was 
packed everyday, I might not eat it, but there's days that I wish I 
had more too, because I was out there so long. You got to make 
sure you always have water, Gatorade, they called it click kick, 
Gatorade, Poweraid, in the summer months you always had to 
have that. You had to drink so much water an hour and then a 
click kick. When it was really extremely hot. 
SIMS: 
30:18 
Because the shift leaders would, they would watch that? 
MAZIOT: 
30:21 
Not really, it was your responsibility to take care of yourself. 
You go down it's your fault, you didn't take care of yourself. 
 
13 
SIMS: 
30:27 
Right, did that happen a lot? 
MAZIOT: 
30:30 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). Especially with soldiers. Oh my God, I 
remember 509th came from Alaska down here in the summer, 
we had people from Hawaii come once here in the summer. 
And these were big giant guys, that were just plop, plop, they 
got too hot, didn't drink their water. It's sad, you know? 
SIMS: 
30:53 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). What about, were you allowed to 
smoke out there? 
MAZIOT: 
30:59 
Not when, you weren't allowed to speak English, smoke or 
anything, eat, nothing. If you had to go to the bathroom it was a 
dire emergency, you had to bring a buddy with you, coverup, 
don't look at the soldiers, do what you got to do and get back. If 
the soldiers were in the village you were relaxed, you were 
selves, do what you want. As soon as you see a soldier though 
you're back in character. You had to stay in character, and you 
could get wrote up or fired is you did not stay in character.  
SIMS: 
31:33 
Were people getting fired up often? I know that you said a lot of 
people quit after one day, but- 
MAZIOT: 
31:38 
For sleeping.  
SIMS: 
31:39 
Sleeping? 
MAZIOT: 
31:41 
Yeah. Or not doing their character correctly, you know just go 
up to the soldiers start speaking English, you can't just do that.  
SIMS: 
31:48 
Do people get warnings or they pretty much- 
MAZIOT: 
31:51 
You get three write ups before you get fired. 
SIMS: 
31:54 
Uh-huh. 
MAZIOT: 
31:56 
But sleeping was a major thing. You're out there all those hours 
and if there's nothing going on, it's very easy to fall asleep if 
you're sitting in a chair all day. You got to get up walk around or 
whatever, but it was definitely your responsibility to take care 
of yourself make sure you were warm or cold or whatever, 
hungry, thirsty. You had a pack, we had a back pack and a lunch 
box, and a chair, a folding chair, everyday we had to take with 
us. 
SIMS: 
32:29 
You had to bring your own chair? 
 
14 
MAZIOT: 
32:30 
Yeah. Where are you going to sit? You wanted to sit down you 
had to bring your own chair. I still have mine in my living room, I 
still sit in mine. Serious, I miss it. No. I do miss work out there, I 
really do, I liked it.  
SIMS: 
32:49 
So you had- 
MAZIOT: 
32:49 
It- 
SIMS: 
32:49 
Go head. 
MAZIOT: 
32:52 
It was my social hour. I got to see the community, but after like 
four days I was ready to go back to the house where it was 
quiet.  
SIMS: 
33:02 
So there was an accident, is that why you stopped working? 
MAZIOT: 
33:05 
Yeah. I got into an accident out there, five years ago, almost five 
years ago. I'm on disability now, total disable.  
SIMS: 
33:13 
Like a car accident? 
MAZIOT: 
33:15 
No, actually I just fell, but it messed up my spine and everything 
bad. 
SIMS: 
33:22 
Sorry to hear that.  
MAZIOT: 
33:24 
I got a new knee last year for Christmas, it looks like I'm getting 
a new shoulder this year, so. 
SIMS: 
33:24 
Mm-hmm (affirmative). 
MAZIOT: 
33:35 
I got my battle scars. 
SIMS: 
33:36 
Yeah. 
MAZIOT: 
33:40 
But, I don't know I used to role play though, you know whatever 
they wanted me to do. They'd always look at me, JoAnn. I even 
know how to moulage, you know make boo boos on people, 
and people would, please help me.  
SIMS: 
33:59 
You have to do your own moulage? 
MAZIOT: 
34:01 
No, shift leaders are supposed to do that, but they'd come to 
me.  
 
15 
MAZIOT: 
34:04 
No, shift leaders are supposed to do that but they'd come to me 
and ask me, "How do I do this? How do I do that?" Because I did 
it for so long. You know? Or, "Please can you help me? I've got 
five people today." You know I got in to everything.  
MAZIOT: 
34:16 
But I like it. It kept me busy. I wasn't sitting around in my little 
fold up chair, yard chair, whatever you wanna call it. And I 
learned a lot about a different country. About our country. 
About brother of men. How they do for each other. They have 
their own little family right there and then they have their 
family at home. When they were together, they were together. 
No ands, ifs, or buts. They had each and everyone else's butt. If 
one was too skinny they'd give him this big jar of peanut butter 
and tell him to eat it. And the smallest one always had the 
biggest gun. I guess to beef him up, I don't know.  
MAZIOT: 
35:09 
But they took care of each other. It's just a shame now that a lot 
of them are messed up. Half of them are crippled. Half of them 
can't function because of what they've seen and been through.  
SIMS: 
35:29 
Were you able to talk to them there about that? Or did ... I 
mean you have to be in character. Like how did that - 
MAZIOT: 
35:37 
Well when the soldiers weren't in the village we had 509th, they 
were the bad guys. So we get to talk to them a lot. But you just 
hear stories. Like funny and sad. You just hear a lot. They just 
tell you stuff but there's certain things you just didn't touch. 
Like, did you kill anybody? Never. You don't say that. That's one 
rule that you just didn't do. But if they wanted to volunteer 
we'd listen. You know? We really didn't ask much. It's really not 
my place to say, "Hey, what happened over there?" Or ... it's 
really not. I don't know if they want to talk about it or not.  
MAZIOT: 
36:35 
There was one guy when we were in the middle of a roll that 
the observer controllers, four of them had to come sit him 
down. Something we were doing just triggered something from 
back over there and you could see it in his eyes that he was 
about ready to go crazy.  
SIMS: 
36:55 
And what was he doing?  
MAZIOT: 
36:55 
He was just like he was there. Just with his gun up for real. Like 
thank God we had rubber bullets or no bullets but he was back 
there. You could just tell. He wasn't the same. He was pushing 
and pulling and throwing people on the ground and cursing. It 
was just totally something we did or he smelled or something 
somebody said. I don't know, but he was back in Iraq. That has 
 
16 
happened a couple times too. You know 'cause we have bombs 
going off. You got that smell and the smoke and you got all of us 
yelling at you in Arabic and you know. And it could be like you're 
back over there in a bad situation, I don't know. I'm just going 
by what I hear. I'm not experienced but ... and I like to watch 
different things like I watch a lot of National Geographic and 
they have stuff on soldiers all the time. I like to watch that all 
kind of stuff. I like the PJs, helicopters.  
SIMS: 
38:10 
Have you ever flown in a helicopter?  
MAZIOT: 
38:12 
Nope, never got a ride. Close. I got to a helicopter once. They 
said I had too much blood on me. He just washed it, he wasn't 
letting me in.  
SIMS: 
38:23 
Fake blood?  
MAZIOT: 
38:24 
Yeah, moulage. Mm-hmm (affirmative).  
SIMS: 
38:27 
And were you ever killed as a role player?  
MAZIOT: 
38:30 
Oh yeah, KIA, yeah. They give you these little cards. I have all 
this stuff at the house. You don't have any of these stuff?  
SIMS: 
38:38 
I have some of it.  
MAZIOT: 
38:40 
And I have a coin you could have looked at. Damn I would of ... 
Newspaper articles. The only reason why I kept it was because I 
was in it. You know like my picture. Nobody can tell it's me 
because I'm in garb but I know it's me.  
MAZIOT: 
38:53 
They gave us these little cards. BDA cards I think they called 
them. And it would tell you your wound and some wounds were 
letter urgent or just letter or KIA or ... You really didn't want a 
KIA card 'cause you'd have to move out of your village to a new 
village in the middle of a rotation and you just got comfortable 
with the people you're with. You knew who to stay away from 
in the morning and in the afternoon and what house to just stay 
away from or ... There was always one house with older 
gentlemen in and I used to go every morning and have coffee 
with them. They taught me how to fix my pipes in my house, my 
truck. "Oh, this is what's wrong with your truck, go get this." 
They taught me a lot of stuff. I just purchased a house. I didn't 
know how to fix nothing. I go there and they tell me. They 
taught me a lot. Lawnmowers, trucks, stuff like that. I don't 
know. You live out there actually and you go home for a couple 
hours.  
 
17 
SIMS: 
40:03 
Right. That's a good way of thinking about it.  
MAZIOT: 
40:06 
That's the way it is. It's like you're living with these people for 
two weeks so you figure out who's not a morning person, who's 
not an afternoon person.  
SIMS: 
40:16 
So between two rotations, what percentage of the village that 
you go back to is people from the previous rotation? Is it - 
MAZIOT: 
40:26 
Usually all stick together for a couple months and then they 
swap you all around, 'cause too many buddies. Too many 
people get too comfortable with one person or two people and 
then they just stay right there with those three people. They 
don't get out and move around as much as they're supposed to. 
Like the soldiers say you had to walk up and down for hours 
sometimes on these rocks that would twist your ankles off 
pretending like you're at the market. Just up and down the 
road. And they built stuff, we called it Hollywood. In the 
beginning we didn't have all that. It wasn't Iraq and Afghanistan 
it was just other Bosnia and America and stuff. And then they 
brought these people and we called it Hollywood, it looked like 
Afghanistan. They built markets, these little carts we push up 
and down and sell fruit and eggs and whatever.  
SIMS: 
41:29 
What was your opinion of when they made it more - 
MAZIOT: 
41:32 
Hollywood? It was cool. I liked it but they ruined our buildings. 
We all got sick from black mold. Hammering all that stuff up, 
put holes in the building and ruined our buildings. A lot of them 
were condemned and we still had to role play ... sit in them. A 
lot of people got sick 'cause of black mold.  
SIMS: 
41:53 
Just coughing and - 
MAZIOT: 
41:55 
Cough, cough, cough. I had it. Cough, cough, cough, cough, 
cough, cough, cough, cough. I mean non-stop, the whole 
rotation. As soon as you're out of role play, you're okay. You go 
to role play and everybody's saying, "Quit smoking, quit 
smoking." Well after a couple years everybody had it. There's 
people that still have it. I don't.  
SIMS: 
42:17 
How do you get rid of it?  
MAZIOT: 
42:20 
A lot of antibiotics and steroids. Have you met Miss Carol 
Adams yet?  
SIMS: 
42:27 
No.  
 
18 
MAZIOT: 
42:28 
She has it right now. She hasn't worked out there for two, three 
years. She's right now sick 'cause of out there. I swear it's from 
out there but - 
SIMS: 
42:38 
Is there's a workman's comp for that? 
MAZIOT: 
42:45 
No. No workman's comp is not a great thing anyhow so it's 
really not. They won't do anything for you so ... and they won't 
turn you loose. I'm having a bad deal with that, maybe 
everybody isn't but not a good way to go. It's really not. But 
since it was my spine I wanted a professional to take care of my 
back and neck and everything and I was going to charity at the 
time. And they're teaching young people how to become 
doctors and I just didn't want ... no needles from them in my 
back. But it just didn't work out too good for me. Doesn't mean 
everybody had a bad deal but ... 
SIMS: 
43:39 
Is there anything else about role play that we didn't cover that 
you think - 
MAZIOT: 
43:44 
I don't know. I don't know exactly what you're looking for. 
These guys need some kind of training. I hope they don't take 
this away. Okay it might not be Iraq and Afghanistan. It might 
not be like it was in 2003 but there's gonna be something else 
coming up one day with the way the world's going. Like North 
Korea, whatever. I'm just saying. And these kids come and they 
look like they're 12 years old. I have asked them, "Do your 
mama knows where you're at?" And they have one little 
whisker they think they can go shave. I mean ... and they're 
going over there and they might not come back. And if they do 
they might come back with this missing or that missing or ... I 
wish there was something more we could do for them when 
they do come home. There's not enough stuff for them out 
there. I still don't think it's as bad as Vietnam which I was a kid 
during those days but I remember in my teens and twenties 
how these guys were just ... They had nothing. No help at all. 
They were baby killers. It's not as bad as that I don't think. I 
don't know. But I don't know. We need something for these 
gentlemen. These are our future. Our sons, our brothers, our 
fathers. This is our future. What's gonna happen to our country 
if everybody's wounded? It will come here one day. It has come 
here.  
MAZIOT: 
45:39 
I really don't know what y'all hunting as far as role play. I 
thought it was cool. I loved it. I wish I could be out there now 
and there's no way I could do that anymore. But somebody's 
gotta do it.  
 
19 
SIMS: 
45:53 
Okay. Well I appreciate your time. It was fun talking with you.  
MAZIOT: 
46:04 
Okay. I hope I helped out a little. I don't know what you're 
looking for really.  
SIMS: 
46:08 
Well it's not that it's a - 
MAZIOT: 
46:09 
Intel.  
SIMS: 
46:10 
Well just stories that better give a sense what the work is like 
and just doing the work and - 
MAZIOT: 
46:18 
Mostly we had writers and they would write stuff which is going 
on today in the world. Wherever we're at at that time. And a lot 
of it was true to what ... Not everything you see on the t.v. is 
true. But we had the general idea. Like when they beheaded, I 
believe it was a journalist, we had that added for a poke. We 
had journalists, we had newspaper people and they captured on 
and they beheaded him and had a video. Okay, this is all 
scenario, not real, but it all looks real.  
SIMS: 
47:02 
How did they do the video?  
MAZIOT: 
47:04 
I don't know but there was a video going around. We were able 
to sit down if we wanted to and watch it. Where they could... 
And we had Arabic music everyday. I could sing it and dance to 
it whatever. I didn't enjoy it but by the end of the week I knew 
their songs. And we had Arabic ... everything was Arabic. 
Nothing American when you're out there. You're in a different 
country. It looks like it. You talk, you eat some of that ... the 
Afghani people, the real role players. What are they called? 
Cultural role players would make us one day of their food and 
we have to eat one day of their food. Most of it was great. But it 
was like living in another country. It was hard. I'm just glad I'm 
an American. I can say what I want, do what I want, eat when I 
want. Women are very limited to what they can and can't do 
over there. I don't know. I don't know if I could deal with it. Not 
me.  
MAZIOT: 
48:19 
But ... 
SIMS: 
48:26 
Thanks, again. I'll turn these off.
