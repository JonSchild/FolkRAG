rotary cooker_ 
DMM_361-371.jpg 
Bellue’s Pressurized Rotary Cooker. A six foot long 
cylinder, 24” in diameter. Many uses: dry tumble 500 
to 700 hundred pounds of meat to work in seasonings 
and break up the protein; able to cook 1000 pound 
bags of assorted products; 800,000 BTU’s. “One hell 
of a cooking machine,” Bellue remarked. Dry mixer, 
wet mixer, browner, vacuum tumbler, pressure cooker. 
Also can be configured with an injector to inject 
turkeys with seasonings in 4 seconds flat before they 
are cooked. White beans are set to be cooked in this 
sequence of photos.

rotary grill_ 
DMM_372.jpg 
Bellue designed and fabricated this grill to toast large 
numbers of po’ boy buns. The solid 3/4” plate inside 
rotates. Unit grills 40 po’ boy buns at a time. Unlike a 
conventional grill, the heat remains the same  
at any given point on the grill surface.
