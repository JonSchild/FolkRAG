[0:00] AG: Hi Franklin. Thank you so much again for joining these Library of Congress oral history 
interviews. Can I ask you to introduce yourself? 
FN: Yes, my name is Franklin Nduku. I am a nurse at the Houston VA hospital. I've been working for 
about seven years. My current role in the organization is I'm a Magnet Program Director, which is an 
accreditation that looks at the quality of nursing in a hospital. I pretty much make sure that we are on 
track to keep meeting that standard that that accreditation comes with. Like I said, I've been a nurse for 
seven years, and I really love the field. 
AG: Wonderful. I'm so excited to hear more about particularly the magnet accreditation process. Before 
we do that, can I ask you a bit about your upbringing and your family background? 
FN: I was born in Lagos, Nigeria, but I came to the US when I was about six or seven years old. I grew 
up in Houston, on the southwest side of Houston. I have two brothers, two sisters, very close-knit 
family. My mom is the pillar of our family. She's the one that actually talked me into getting into 
nursing, just based on my personality. I am a people person and also love sciences, so she thought it'd be 
a good field for me. So, reluctantly, I did it, but ended up being a great decision. 
AG: Oh, wonderful. So, she kind of saw that you could meld that humanistic and scientific mind in the 
profession. 
FN: Yes, definitely. 
AG: Oh, that's cool. 
FN: She had a vision. I didn't [laughs]. 
AG: Did your parents work? 
FN: Yes. 
AG: What kind of work did they do? 
FN: My dad did security for a health care company for a while. Right now he is retired, and my mom, 
she worked multiple jobs when we first came. She started off working at fast food restaurants, then she 
opened up her own hair salon, and then she's worked in corrections as a correctional officer. Currently, 
what she does right now is she is a bus driver for the Houston ISD, and she's been doing that for about 
eight years now. 
AG: When you were growing up, do you recall sort of enjoying any specific subjects in school or being 
drawn, like you said, to the scientific or other aspects of your education? 
FN: Favorite subject was definitely history and the sciences, biology and things like that. Biology and 
history were my favorite subjects. Not great at math, not the best in English. I speak very well, but I 
don't like the grammar and [unintelligible] all that. I had trouble with that.

AG: Were there extracurricular or social activities that you were involved in as a young person? 
FN: Yes, I was in one of the highest level-- art was my thing, art and sports, obviously. I played football 
in high school and in college, and I also was in art. Our AP art program in my high school, it was the AP 
Art three, which is like the highest level of art you could be in in Texas. We were doing independent 
studies with sculpting, use oil painting, and the class kind of helps you work with different mediums and 
things like that. The football thing was definitely something I was really good at. It got me a scholarship 
to go to school. 
AG: Do you continue to practice art as well? 
FN: Well, I draw on occasion. It's been a long time. But normally, it's sketching. My little brother, he 
actually took that mantle. He is a professional artist. He does mostly Afrocentric art and Afro-political 
art. But no, with work and two children, it's really hard to find time to do that. 
AG: Of course, of course. B, I will turn it over to you. I know you wanted to ask the next chunk. 
B: Can you remember going to the doctor as a young child and what that experience was kind of like? 
FN: We didn't go to the doctor a lot. When we did, mostly it was for physicals for me to play sports, 
because growing up, I didn't have insurance or anything like that. So, if you went to the doctor you had 
to be [laughs] at death's door. It used to make me nervous. I do remember that. When people are 
running tests and things on you because you don't know. I always thought they would find something. 
That's where my mind [unintelligible], even as a child. But other than that, that's all I really remember. 
We didn't go that much to doctors. 
B: Do you think that nervousness influenced how you want patients to feel when you're interacting with 
them? 
[05:13] FN: Definitely. I think me being a Black man and just understanding some of the things that go 
on in medicine, I think it was very conscious of me the way I approached the patients I work with to 
make them feel comfortable. The first thing I try to do is build that rapport with them to help them 
understand that I'm there to care for them and provide anything that they need. I think that's one of the 
things I really love, more than the sciences or even the medicine part of nursing, was the interactions 
with the patient. 
B: What was the process like for you to get credentialed to become a nurse? 
FN: Oh, it was a lot. First, for my bachelor's program, I took four and a half years to get that. You have 
to go through your bachelor's program, then even to be able to get the opportunity to get a license, you 
have to pass an exit exam out of school. Once that's done, there's a board exam that you have to sit for. 
It's on a computer. The questions range from 75 to 200 and something, and it only shuts off either when 
you fail there or if you pass, and you won't know for another two weeks. That was stressful. But once 
you reach that point and you pass your boards, then you are a registered nurse after your bachelor's. I 
went through all of that.

B: Where'd you get your degree from? 
FN: Prairie View A&M University. It's one of the historically black colleges and universities here in 
Houston, in the Houston area. I went there. 
AG: You also said MSN. What does that stand for, Franklin? 
FN: Master's of Science in Nursing. I have a master's in nursing education as well, in addition to my 
bachelor's. 
AG: Did you go directly from your bachelor's to your master's? 
FN: No, no, definitely not. It is possible, but most of the time, some of the programs won't even accept 
you unless you have some experience. I would not ever recommend anybody going straight from 
bachelor's to master's, because your practice kind of gives you the tools you need to even become a 
master's. Having a master's degree assumes that you are proficient as a practicing nurse, and coming out 
as a bachelor's, you're definitely not. 
AG: It sounds like you entered your BA program with the plan to become a nurse. Is that right? 
FN: Yes, definitely. Definitely. Like I said, reluctantly, but yes. It took me three or four semesters to 
kind of get my mind geared towards it. When I first came into college, my thing was, "Okay, I'm going 
to play football. I'm just going to do the nursing as a major to make my mom happy." As time went on, 
as I got into the the actual core classes, I really enjoyed it. 
B: What was your first job as a nurse? 
FN: Was actually here in the VA, at the Houston VA. I did some internships at MD Anderson, which is 
a cancer hospital, but my first real job was here as a staff nurse on a medicine unit, which is just a 
general admission unit, caring for patients. I did that for about five and a half years before I transitioned 
over when I got my master's and I became an educator. I was actually educating nursing students as a 
private instructor, preparing them for their board exams and helping them make that process to become 
registered nurses. Then, shortly after that, I got my position here at the same Houston VA as the Magnet 
Program Director. 
B: And what made working for VA appealing to you? 
FN: Coming out of school, it was one of the first places that offered me, and I had some people that I 
knew that worked here that always spoke about the great benefits and things like that. I really didn't 
know much. As a new grad, you really don't care where you work. You're just trying to get a job because 
it's so competitive here in Houston. But once I got in, it was really honestly just the patients, the 
interactions with the veterans and hearing their stories, connecting with them. Me being a male, my 
experience was they're more open with me, and I can just talk to them just on a straight level. I really 
enjoy that. The VA is like a small family. You would even know, because we're like their hospital, a lot 
of their family members on a first name basis. I could see them at a store or down the stairs, and we're in 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
7 
a cafeteria. I could say, "Hey it's John. Hey Frank." And so it's just a special-- a special place to work for 
me. 
[10:26] AG: It sounds like the majority of your patients are male. 
FN: Oh, yes, definitely. 
AG: Yeah. Does being a man yourself provide some rapport initially with your patients? 
FN: It really does. It’s different. When the other nurses, the female nurses, interact with patients, they do 
provide something I can't, which is that kind of motherly caring thing. But for me, what I provide them 
is almost a brotherly type of thing. I think that is a different dynamic that male nurses have with patients, 
especially here at the VA. Most of the time, if there was a difficult patient, I would be the one to have 
them because they act differently when it's a male. It's almost like having a bunch of brothers there. I 
really enjoy the different conversations. One of the interesting things that I've found with our patients in 
VAs across the country is that you really get to see a representation of different time frames in American 
history, because I've taken care of veterans from World War II, and their philosophies and point of 
views on lives are a little different than the veterans from the Korean era, or the ones that were during 
Vietnam, the ones that were in the Desert Storm, or the most recent ones with Iraqi and Afghanistan 
campaigns. Each one, and this is something we learned as VA nurses over time, you have to approach 
them differently, in the way you speak to them, the way they interact, their expectations, and just 
hearing the stories from-- I've taken a veteran that was at the beaches in Normandy. One of my patients 
that I had when I first started was in one of the first black platoons that were there. I think in Normally 
they had some black battalions that were mostly black, and just different little historical things like that. 
Hearing about the Vietnam veterans and their fear when they were kids. You're 19 getting drafted, and I 
can only imagine. But just thousands of stories like that over the years. It really just makes it like a really 
cool, cool experience just to be a nurse here. 
AG: Can you describe a little bit of, like you, said, some of the generational differences? 
FN: Right. With the World War II vets, they're very cooperative, I would say. I think their view of 
medicine is more trusting. I did notice that a lot of them are-- they're more settled in their lives. In 
contrast, as you start moving towards the Vietnam era, and you have to keep in mind, I love history, so 
trying to tie it all together. Even hearing some of their stories of thinking of how the Vietnam vets 
retreated when they came back from Vietnam, despite most of them being drafted in. The country at that 
time was going through some changes, so the society didn't receive them. When you were a vet in the 
World War II period, you were a hero. You come back to your town, people are praising you. It seems 
like a lot of the World War II people were more stable. They would have their families around more 
often, have lead successful lives. And with the Vietnam, we started dealing with a lot of different issues 
with alcohol and drug addiction, homelessness. So, there's that. Then as you transition down to our 
current vets now, most of the issues they're having is dealing with mental health issues. I think one of 
the things that one of them told me was that back in the day, even if you were drafted, you would do one 
tour, a tour or two but now, a lot of them are making a career out of the military. They're serving three, 
four, five, six, seven tours, and it's just taking a mental toll on them. Our younger vets are usually 
getting mental health treatment right now as they are. That's just some of the things that I've noticed and 
with that. Just hearing the stories of the experiences of each different era can tell you how they feel 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
8 
about the military and everything in general. Like I said, I think though, during the World War II era, 
there was a thing in the country that it was seen as you're a hero, so they didn't have all these action 
heroes and comic books, so the soldiers were on the posters that the kids had. As you transition down 
with people becoming just more aware of some of the things that happen in war, it kind of faded away. 
[15:19] B: Do you approach working with newer nurses or trainees teaching them about that 
generational divide? 
FN: I think with the newer nurses, the main focus is really on getting them acclimated to nursing in 
general. When I work with them, I try to first of all remember when I was a new nurse and think about 
the different barriers. I think with new nurses, their biggest issue is confidence, and it can be challenging 
when you're working with a population of veterans. Like I said, it's not all roses and bubbles. They can 
be difficult because of some of the mental health issues and whatever other issues, trust issues that they 
have. If you have some newer nurses that aren't used to that type of kind of confrontational approach to 
speaking to somebody, sometimes it may be shocking for them. What I try to do is just tell them take it 
day by day. I mentor some young nurses, and my main thing for them is just helping them be confident 
in themselves and just letting them know their mistakes, and if somebody yells at you or whatever 
happens, it's not because of you. It's just part of the role, and you just have to kind of get your feet under 
you and just keep taking it day by day. The first year of nursing is really just-- you're just lost a lot and 
everything happens really fast, 'cause there's no way school prepares you for what you experience in real 
life. Because the school teaches you the theoreticals and why, so you can answer the whys in your head, 
but when you're actually in it, the practical part of it is something you have to learn on the fly.  
AG: Franklin, do you recall your first year as a nurse? 
FN: Oh, yes. 
AG: Did you work the night shift, the day shift?  
FN: I did both, actually. I worked the evening shift, which was from 11:30 to midnight, because that was 
what my preceptor worked. Sometimes he would work nights. The first year, your whole mindset is, "I 
don't want to mess up," which is a fearful approach to nursing, and it can be very stressful because you 
second guess all your decisions. You're working from a place of basically not trying to kill somebody. 
That was just what it was. I had my books, all my little nursing books, with me. I'd carry my backpack. 
You would think I was still going to school, just reading up everything two or three times to make sure 
I'm doing the right thing, asking a lot of questions, just the confidence there was just really, really not 
evident at that point in my career. There's actually a nursing theory. There's a nursing theorist that has a 
theory about nurses transitioning from novice to expert, where you go through stages. When you're a 
novice, everything you do is based on what the book tells you. Then as you transition to a expert, you 
kind of become intuitive. It's definitely true. I was definitely a novice and scared [laughs] a lot as a new 
grad.  
AG: Are there any patients or instances from that first year, the first few years, that remain with you, 
you know, that you kind of won't ever forget because they went so well or went so poorly or, you know, 
like you said, you felt scared on the job? Like, anything that's sort of really seared into your memory 
from those early years?  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
9 
FN: Yeah, there's two: one positive, one not so positive. The first positive was one of our World War 
vets that was blind. I took care of him for a month. We really became close. Even when I didn't have 
him as a patient, I'd go there and talk to him. He would ask about my family. Eventually he got 
discharged, and he sent me a handwritten letter, just thanking me for helping him while he was in the 
hospital and telling me to keep on with the way I am. That was really kind of-- just 'cause he told me a 
lot of different stories of the war. The negative one was more of-- not that the patient was mean or 
anything but it was more of a practice thing. I had a patient that came in. He had an infection, and I was 
taking care of him. Over time, he got sicker, and he had to get transferred to another unit. He ended up 
getting-- going to the ICU, getting really, really sick. When I think about that patient and with the 
knowledge I have now, there were so many signs that I missed as a new grad nurse that I would know 
intuitively now that I maybe possibly could have intervened earlier on making them, kind of providing 
some interventions to help him not be as sick as he was. But that's just how I see it. I guess that kind of 
goes back to that novice to expert and that intuition thing that you have. It's just when you're a new grad, 
you just don't know. You're just trying to survive. It really does make a difference to have that 
experience as a nurse. That's why it's important that they tell us to get your two, three years before you 
try to go back to school, because, for example, if I had tried to be a nurse practitioner, where I'd be 
ordering and being a provider for a patient, if I went straight from my BSN to my Master's for that, I 
would miss that intuition phase where you kind of see patients over and over and over again, so you 
build up this knowledge base of what are signs and symptoms that aren't in the book that you could tell 
that, "Okay, well, this guy isn't doing so well." That really stuck with me. That's what I tell the students 
that I have. I always tell everybody that story to let them know, first of all, that I'm human, and 
secondly, that it's important to get your experience as a nurse 'cause it could really mean life or death for 
a person.  
[21:36] AG: When you were working on the medical floor, were there very common diagnoses? 
FN: I think congestive heart failure is probably-- everybody, every other person has that and diabetes 
were two very common ones. On a medicine floor you get everything. We've had patients with Lou 
Gehrig's disease, or some random form of meningitis or tuberculosis, heart problems, lung problems, 
transplant, amputations. It just varies. Actually, I actually enjoyed some of the random ones, the random 
types of diagnoses that you would have on there. Anything with congestive heart failure or diabetes and 
high blood pressure, you see that a million times over and over and over again. I really do believe that 
even in those patients that are very common, there's nuances that you won't read in a textbook and that 
you can use to help them and teach them on things to do that they can do at home. Especially for here in 
the VA in Houston, in the medical center at the VA here, it's in kind of an urban area. So, we have a lot 
of African American veterans, and a lot of time there's a cultural-- What is it? A cultural barrier between 
medicine and medical staff. These patients, when it comes to education, not a barrier like they won't 
educate them, but actually trying to speak onto their level and understand them and speak their language 
to help them be able to make good health decisions. Even if it's something common, like high blood 
pressure, and having that kind of connection with them allowed me to help those patients. As I grew as a 
nurse, that allowed me to help them more, to give them tips: "Hey, don't eat this. Eat that," talking to 
their family members and trying to-- just different things like that.  
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
10 
AG: So, it sounds like some significant component of treating patients, particularly with diabetes and 
hypertension and perhaps congestive heart failure, has to do with the education component and 
communicating what their diagnosis means for when they leave the hospital. Is that right?   
FN: That is 1,000% right, because those are chronic conditions, and so whenever they're in the hospital 
it's because their preventive measures and their lifestyle habits may have not been corrected or they 
weren't applying it correctly. Sometimes it's things that are out of their hands. A lot of times it's just just 
lack of knowledge of the actions they are taking. So, yes, preventing or not preventing, but keeping 
those chronic conditions at bay really falls on education. A lot of times it's just a doctor saying, "You 
have congestive heart failure. Take your big word medicine and this and that." Patient they're gonna nod 
and say, "Yes, yes, yes." Then I'll come back after the doctor, "Did you understand anything he said?" 
"Oh, no." Then you have to go back and re go through everything with them, kind of speaking in a way-
- I think that's one thing that's lacking in medicine. It's just that cultural awareness for patients, because
most people don't know the terminology or even the words that a lot of us in medicine use to speak to
each other, so if you can't communicate that clearly to them, then they're going to be back in the
hospital.
AG: Were there any tactics that you found especially effective? 
[25:26] FN: Yes, I think using analogies is what-- even I use that in teaching. I always try to find a real 
world example to explain very complex concepts, just trying to explain the implications of what the 
patient's have, why taking their meds, but using, examples from real world, and just trying to explain it 
in-- if I have to speak Ebonics, I will to do that. If I have to speak properly, I will. I think having that 
versatility in itself, to me, it's a skill that I wish more people in medicine would have, which it kind of 
goes back. It is good to have a diverse workforce, because you can interact with patients differently if 
you kind of understand where they're coming from. But, just analogies. You have to understand who the 
gatekeepers for health are within that culture as well, whether it's a wife or a sister or, you know, a son 
or a mother, or is it the, you know, the husband, whoever the gatekeeper is and speaking to them. Is it a 
child that may be able to understand some of the terminology better, and they're the ones that could guilt 
their dad into taking their meds. It's just like a people person skill that you have to have. Just because 
somebody has a Master's or a bachelor's or you're a doctor, it doesn't mean you're good at that. I think 
that’s half the battle with medicine. It’s really getting the patients to take care of themselves. 
AG: That's a great point. It sounds like you were very well suited for floor nursing, you know, being a 
staff RN. What was your decision process like for going back to teaching and deciding to pursue your 
Master's? 
FN: In me I started getting, I don't want to say bored, but it was just something. I just felt like I could do 
more. Once you reach a certain level, and you get to your fifth year, and then everybody tells you when 
you-- after five years as a nurse, you're pretty-- you're pretty stable, you know it. You have reached that 
intuition phase and so I just wanted to do more. I always loved teaching and explaining things to people, 
and trying to impart some of the things I've learned to younger nurses, because I would be the go-to 
person for when we had nursing students come to the unit. They would be with me, so I helped a lot of 
them in kind of their practical courses as they came to the hospital when they're in nursing school. I 
really enjoyed that. I've always loved teaching. It's just something that I've always loved to do, and

coaching or teaching or something like that. I just thought it was time, so I went back and thought 
education would be a great thing. 
AG: Where did you pursue your Master's in nursing? 
FN: I did it at Grand Canyon University. I did a online education program. It's about a two and a half 
year course. 
AG: Then once you get the MSN, you pick a track, either teaching or management, something like that. 
Is that right? 
FN: Well, the MSN allows you to do education in a academic setting and in a hospital setting, but in 
nursing, having a Master's-- most of the components and getting the Master's degree are similar across 
the different tracks. Some of your core classes, that's what kind of makes you special in whether you're a 
educator or you're informatics or you're in leadership. For me, once you have that, I can teach, but you 
would also have the prerequisites to be a manager or somebody in a supervisory role or somebody that 
works in professional development, which is kind of what I'm doing now in other aspects. You will 
notice if you ever come to look at a roster of nurses, let's say, and they have Master's degree, it's rare that 
they work what their Master's are. A lot of them work in just different fields. 
AG: So, it's a versatile degree, then. 
FN: Yeah. 
AG: It sounds like your first position out of the Master's was traditional classroom teaching. 
FN: Called the NCLEX, which is the board exam, NCLEX preparation, and I was a private tutor. I 
would have clients, mostly nursing students that were about to graduate and needed preparation for their 
boards exams. I set up a curriculum for them, and we would meet up and study, whether virtually or in 
person. I was doing that for a while, and some tutoring for nursing students in nursing school. I never 
actually got into where I was a professor or anything like that. But I was doing the private educator 
position for about a year or two. I think it was about two years almost.  
AG: And how did you make your way back to the VA?  
FN: Oh, I never left. Never left. 
AG: You never left. I see. 
FN: No, no, I never left. I was working, doing that on the side. 
AG: I see. So, you were working on the medical floor and doing private education? 
FN:Yes. 
AG: You were also, I presume, working while you were pursuing your Master's?

FN: Yes, I worked then too. 
AG: I see. 
FN: I'm the breadwinner in my family. I had no choice [laughs]. That was not an option. 
AG: That must have been a very busy time. 
FN: Oh my god. I think my son was three and my daughter was born at that time. It was crazy. 
AG: I can only imagine. Oh, wow. Do you mind just kind of describing magnet program, what that 
entails? 
[31:33] FN: Sure. The magnet program, what I always say, it's like, if you think about how the Better 
Business Bureau rates businesses with A+ rating or B or C, depending on how good they are, and in a 
different domains, whether it's customer service, price, blah, blah, blah, the Magnet does that for 
hospitals, but it looks specifically at the quality of nursing care. The program is under the American 
Nurses Association. Under their American Nurses credentialing services, their credentialing center, they 
have the program. They come to the hospital, and if you're interested in becoming Magnet, what you do 
is you apply and you pay the money and they send you-- you can get a booklet that has these standards. 
It's about 80-something of them that you have to meet. The standards deal with things like how many of 
your nurses have a certain number of degree levels? How many of your nurses are certified in whatever 
specialty you're working in? They look at your nurse satisfaction: Are the nurses happy working at your 
hospital? They look at your clinical data, as far as your patients, are your patients falling? Are they 
getting infections while they're in your hospital or are they getting sicker? Different things like that. 
They also look at what type of research and innovation are your nurses doing within that hospital. Just to 
say all that, that all those things I just named take you everywhere. If you're talking about the education 
level of your nurses, that deals with professional development and helping nurses going back to school, 
kind of encouraging them to get certified. I have to make sure that we have resources in our hospital. 
We're doing that for them when we're talking about our satisfaction. I have to make sure that we have 
events, we're recognizing our staff, we're showing them love for the things they're doing. We're creating 
a healthy work environment for them. If we're talking about our clinical indicators, what are our falls 
and our infections for our patients? We have to make sure that we're doing the best things for our 
veterans, make sure we're caring for them. I'm helping on projects and making sure that we're using the 
most relevant evidence in the things we do. If we're talking about innovation, we're talking about 
research, making sure that our nurses are active in research and evidence-based practice. It's kind of a 
jack-of-all-trades job. My role is just to make sure that we're on track to keep that designation. We've 
been designated for about 16 years. You get designated every four years. We've had four. You have it 
for four-- you get designated. You have four years, then you have to reapply, and they come in. What 
they do is they'll come to your hospital. They'll go through all your records, look at all your roster data, 
interview your nurses, interview your staff, interview the patients and ask them questions. It's a week-
long event. We have to write up these narratives about why we should be based on those standards. How 
do we meet this standard? How do we meet-- It's a lot of project management and professional 
development, mentorship, working in research and things like that. With my skill set, I think it kind of 
was something that was a match made in heaven for me, 'cause I kind of dabble in a lot of those already.

That's pretty much it. I work with different staff and I have some colleagues that work with me in doing 
this as well. I have a group of nurses that are what we call Magnet Ambassadors that are outside of their 
regular jobs that they coordinate events and different things with me [inaudible]. 
B: Does a typical one look like for you right now? 
[35:29] FN: That's a great question. A typical day for me usually involves some meetings. When you're 
in a role like this, there's a lot of meetings with leadership, with different staff. Then I do writing. What I 
do is I-- that manual that has all the standards we have to meet, I go through it and just try to see the 
different projects we're working on, how does that fit some of those standards. If I do find one, I have 
writing sessions with the staff where we sit down and go through, let's say, if a nurse is working on a 
project to reduce falls, and Magnet may have a standard that says that, "Give us an example of nurses 
using a best practice to improve patient care." If a nurse is doing a project on reducing falls, there's an 
example. I have to kind of sit with them and try to help them say it and write it in such a way that it 
meets that standard. We're doing mentoring opportunities, whether I'm meeting with some of the new 
grads to kind of see how they're doing with their roles, 'cause Magnet also looks at retention, and we 
always try our best to keep our newer nurses, because they're the most likely to quit. Then I round on a 
unit just to see what's going on. I always try to see how the nurses are doing and talking to different staff 
members. That's pretty much a typical day. Different times of the year, different things occur. Like, we 
just finished nurses week, and so I was one of the main coordinators for that and all the events that go 
into that, and they're mostly things to kind of keep the staff upbeat. We're doing photo booths during 
Nurses Week, we're having luncheons, different events. We had a singing contest, and things like that. 
So, I'm coordinating that. It's a fun job. I kind of make my own schedule. It's not one thing I should do; 
it's whatever I have to do for us to keep that is what I do. My days are different. One day I could be 
writing all day or reading a policy the next day. Another day I could be out in the community 
coordinating something. Another day, I'm shooting a video for something we're going to use to try to 
help retention. It's a really, really neat, neat job. It is stressful, but very, very flexible and fun. 
AG: I'm just wondering, do you have any staff underneath you, or do you report to anyone in that role? 
It sounds very autonomous. 
FN: It is super autonomous. I don't have any specific staff. Some people in my position at other hospitals 
do. For us, I work kind of parallel with one specific person. I have a nurse that I work with that she 
works in performance improvement, and we kind of tag team a lot of stuff. I report to-- We have a 
Associate Chief Nurse, which is right under our Chief Nurse, so I kind of report to both of them. I report 
to two of the highest nurses in the building. The cool thing about my direct supervisor is that they 
provide me autonomy to do pretty much anything if I-- just because they have grown to trust my work. 
If I have an issue or I have an idea for something, they're 100% supportive. I think in this role, with 
something so big and with so many components to it, you need that leadership support to do what you 
have to do. 
AG: It's just you and then the nurse who's in charge of performance metrics? 
FN: Yes. 
AG: You're responsible for all of this, like you're collaborating and there's no other staff? 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
14 
FN: Yeah, not full-time equivalent staff. But like I said, I have a committee called Magnet Ambassadors, 
where we have representation from each unit in the hospital, where they have a nurse that is assigned to 
collaborate with me in ensuring that we get the second designation. If I need something done on a 
massive scale, we meet once a month, and I can let them know: "Hey, we have our satisfaction surveys 
coming up. I need y'all to make sure that all the nurses on your unit takes the survey and make sure that 
they're aware of it." I'll put some incentives, like whoever gets 100% of their survey, I'll give them a gift 
card or whatever. I kind of have creative ways of-- 'cause they don't get paid for that work. That's just 
extra work on top of what they do. We have some really dedicated nurses. Nursing is like-- 'cause people 
always-- even in that-- when we did Nurses Week, we decorated the campus. We had yard signs. We did 
a thing where we take pictures of all our nursing staff and put them on the walls and we called it the 
Museum of Fine Arts. When you walk in at the entrance, you just see these hundreds of pictures of all 
these beautiful nurses, their faces looking at you. It's very emotional, overwhelming. People were like, 
"Why don't they do that in my department?" I always tell them we didn't hire anybody to do this. Nurses 
naturally are kind of bubbly, and you can always find a nurse who wants to decorate something. They're 
always willing to help in all the events. That's kind of how I get a lot of work done is working with the 
nurses that volunteer to do it. 
B: What would you say are some of the more difficult and what are some of the more rewarding aspects 
of your current position? 
[41:12] FN: Difficult is definitely the fact that the work doesn't stop when you leave the hospital. When 
I was a floor nurse, as soon as I walked out the building, I'm not a nurse anymore. I'm just a-- I didn't 
have any papers or anything to take home. You take care of patients, you give a report, you go home, 
and that's it. Sometimes I forgot what I did for a living. You would see me just [unintelligible], "What is 
this guy?" With this job, because it's more autonomous, that also comes with the fact that it's up to you 
how you meet your deadlines, and I do have deadlines to meet. It's not like anybody's hovering over you 
to tell you, but they just want the results. If we have something to submit to the Magnet Program at a 
certain date, nobody's gonna tell me how to do it. I just have to make sure it's done. Sometimes that 
means taking my work laptop home and working from home, working at home after work. That means 
reading policies and different things at home, or coming in on my weekends to do stuff like that. That's 
probably one of the things that I would say is not so cool about it. The rewarding thing is just the 
interactions. One common theme that I would say throughout my career as a nurse that I always enjoy is 
this interacting with people. When I was a staff nurse it was the patients. Now in this role, I deal more 
with the nursing staff. Helping people, whether they're going through school, mentoring them, new 
grads, trying to help them transition into roles of professional nurses, mentoring leaders, just working 
with different people on projects, I enjoy that aspect of it, and just seeing people grow and seeing that 
light bulb come on when they see that they can do something that they didn't think they could. I will say 
that's the most rewarding. It just comes back to just interaction with people. 
AG: Franklin, would you remind me how long you've been in this particular position? 
FN: Since November of 2019, so it'll be two years this November. 
AG: Do you envision it as something of a interim position? 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
15 
FN: No, no, not at all. I'm not big on supervisory positions, because those come with a lot of-- I don't 
know how to put it, but it's like you-- that's a different relationship with people when you're their 
manager or you're an executive. My role I see it more as a professional developer, and kind of helping 
people reach their goals, which I'm sure you can do from a executive role. I really like the way that this 
job is. I really don't know what I want to do in the future with it, to be honest, because I haven't really 
thought about it. I'm not sure. I guess I'll go with the flow. I don't have any ambitions to become a 
executive or anything like that, 'cause I don't really like dealing with the negative aspects of people and 
interactions. I rather just be all things that they want to do, like go back to school or do a project or 
things like that. 
B: Do you think that you're fairly done with your schooling? 
FN: I do see myself going back and getting a doctorate, just the timing right now wouldn't be great. 
Ultimately, my goal is to teach in a university. I think most of them require you to be a full-time 
professor to have that doctorate degree. At some point in the near future, that will be my next adventure 
to see about doing that. 
AG: Are those degrees something that the VA will encourage you to pursue or even support by funding 
the tuition? 
[45:04] FN: Yeah, they have programs that-- for not all nursing degrees, but mostly ones that are in 
need, they will provide funding for your schooling. The only thing is you have to commit, a three-year 
basic commitment to the facility or you would have to refund the money back. Some people will take 
advantage of that. If you plan on being at the VA long-term, then yes. If not, some people like to go the 
other way. It's mostly for clinical practice roles that they do that for. Now, they do provide some 
supplemental support for other things that they have. That's one thing the VA is really good about is 
resources. There's many, many, many resources they provide for their staff, with nurses, non-nurses, in 
kind of ascending upwards in their roles. It's like a lot of people don't know about them, but it is there. 
B: Were you able to take advantage of that for your Master's degree? 
FN: No, I actually did it on my own, because I wasn't sure in the role of educator-- Remember, I said 
that most of the things that they were in need of were clinical roles. I didn't want to have a commitment 
to the organization for a role that they might have not had a position for and I'd still be working as a staff 
nurse. If I get offered a role at another organization for a educator role, then I wouldn't be able to go, so I 
made the-- Not that I plan on leaving the VA, but I just wanted to keep my options open. So, I did on my 
own. The VA, a lot of the positions are static, unless they open up new positions or somebody retires. 
When people get in, they tend to stay. A lot of these roles, you have to-- there'll be people that have 
nurse practitioner licenses that work as staff nurses for two years until they can find a spot. I didn't want 
to be in that position. 
AG: Franklin, I'm wondering, do you enjoy going to work every day? 
FN: Oh, yes, I really do, because, like I said, it's autonomous, and it's always-- I think having that re-
designation thing keeps me-- , it gives you something to work towards. There's a purpose there than 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
16 
having little projects on the thing that I'm doing. Building towards that really keeps me motivated. I 
enjoy it. It's a pretty neat job. 
AG: Do you think that there is a kind of personality type that tends to be drawn to the nursing profession 
or even health care professions more generally? 
FN: I would say sure, a lot of people are drawn to it, but the people that stick around for it are-- you 
have to be somebody that cares about people, because you won't make it if you don't. I've seen people 
come in and quit, even after going through all their schooling and getting licensed, because the reality is, 
it's not a job where you get glorified. You do a lot of dirty work and nobody really notices, and just you 
and your patient and a lot of this work. Under stress, high, high stress situations, so it's a job you have to 
be a special type of person. A lot of dirty work. Most of the time, we make the joke that we are cleaning 
a lot of poop. You're cleaning a lot of poop and throwup and blood. You watch Grey's Anatomy and all 
these TV shows. You think you're kissing doctors and going out to drinks. It's a lot of kind of just dirty, 
gritty job. But you find your little rewards through your patient interactions and impact in somebody's 
life. If you're not somebody that's really self-motivated and has that kind of perspective on life that you 
can work for something that nobody really sees, then you're really not going to last in the field. But it is 
very rewarding. It's one of those jobs you can go home and just feel good that you did something for 
that. Personally, you've got to be a people person and somebody that is able to put up with a lot of stress. 
That's a hard combination to have that attitude about still loving people and being caring while being 
under duress. 
AG: Are there any self-care strategies that you use to take care of yourself? 
[50:08] FN: For me, definitely working out and just my family is my stress. When I go home, my wife 
and kids try to take my mind off other things. Within the nursing itself, we have different things that we 
try to provide. We have these rooms throughout the hospital called cabotage rooms, and what they are 
are these spaces with flowers, and some of them have misters, and they have soothing sounds, where the 
staff can go in and kind of take a couple of minutes to kind of decompress if they need it. But it's really 
hard to do that when you're working so much on the floor, and you rarely have time to. I think mine is 
just learning to deal with stress overall. My first year, I was really terrible at that, 'cause I was always on 
100, always high, high stress, thinking everything was gonna go wrong. But as time went on, I just 
learned to kind of just take the day as it goes. That's my approach to everything, to things I can't control. 
I just can't control them and things I can do, I do. That's just my personality, too. For some people, 
there's different types of nurses. There's people that are always nervous or finicky, and thinking 
everything is going to go wrong. There's some people that are just very relaxed, and some people are in 
between. We all deal with stress differently as nurses, but you do have to find a way. Whatever your 
thing is, you better have it or you're not going to do very well in the field. Either it's going to run you out 
or it's gonna run you down. 
AG: Do you have time to talk a little bit about what the past year has been like? Did anything change for 
you? 
FN: For me in this role, yes. Well, obviously, with all the restrictions and stuff that we're having. We 
used to meet in person to plan things, so, transitioning over to using Teams and Zoom and all these 
different things. Also, with trying to work with the nursing staff and dealing with the work environment.

It's been very traumatic for some of our staff, the pandemic, especially at the start of it, not knowing 
what was going on or what to expect, and having to come into something so unknown and be the 
frontline for that. I worked throughout in the hospital. Even at the start a bit, we were doing research for 
COVID patients, and I was one of the research data gatherers, going into those rooms with the patients 
you know are COVID-positive and interviewing them. I had to do that for one of the research studies we 
were doing at the start of it. It's been pretty, I think, overall, everybody, even non-nurses, it's been pretty 
traumatic. For nurses, it's been especially traumatic. I don't think we as humans have had time to really 
take a deep breath and reflect on what we just went through. But I would say for us we had a lot of 
nurses retire during the pandemic and leave the nursing field. That was a trend I noticed during then. I 
guess the start of it was really, really hard, just like it was for everybody, but especially if you work in a 
hospital because you know you're around it, and nobody was-- we didn't know all the details about what 
this actually was. Now as we're kind of getting adjusted to it, things are starting to go back to a little bit 
of normalcy for us. I guess it's the new normal now. It's been a long year. 2020 was a really crazy year 
for everybody. 
AG: How do you think the pandemic affected the VA overall? 
[54:06] FN: Well, I think it forced them to innovate some things. I've seen some of the benefits of 
moving some of their processes to using a virtual basis. They developed a lot of new ways of delivering 
care to the veterans. I know one of the things we did here was we had limitations on visitors and non-
essential things, so they started setting up, out in the front of the hospital, these tents with providers. If 
you needed to see a psychiatrist, they would have a webcam there where you can go sit and have your 
visit there. If you needed your prescriptions filled, you can go speak to a pharmacist via the webcam. 
They had social work. They had all these services done virtually, and I think going forward that will 
allow the VA to be able to provide more access and provide more services to patients. A lot of the 
virtual models, even the meetings. I enjoy meeting in person, but you can get so much done if you can 
share your PowerPoint and people can interact and chat. Those are things that will keep going forward, 
just the different innovations that it had for the veterans. I'm sure it was inconvenient for them, 
especially the patients and their families. I know we weren't able to allow visitors for a while for that, so 
a lot of our veterans didn't have that support when they were in the hospital dealing with COVID. I'm 
sure that was a negative thing for them. But as we're kinda opening back up, it should kind of improve. I 
think the innovation that it forced everybody to take on is something positive that we can use going 
forward. 
AG: I'm wondering as well, based on your experiences and expertise, what your sense is of how 
COVID-19 affected healthcare more generally across the United States or even across the world. 
[56:03] FN: What it exposed is something that most people in the field already knew. It did expose a lot 
of the inequities that are in healthcare. As you can see, generally, the population of people that were 
largely impacted were either people of color or low income. Seeing that it's a pandemic, that it's not 
something you can just ignore, and they'll just let them happen. Having that need for preventive health 
and making sure that people have access to health care. I'm hoping that this pandemic really showed that 
you can't really have a healthy nation without taking care of the least of the people and the people that 
are in need. Also, globally, it's just more of the same. Just showing that there's a lot of issues that we 
have in medicine across the globe, with people running out of vaccines and people not being able to be 
tested and how it impacts even some of the Western countries in Europe and in America, that these same 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
18 
people are gonna be coming in and out of the country. I'm hoping that people can see that there is a 
benefit in making sure that everybody has access to health, because it's a community thing and not just 
individuals. 
B: If you've seen any vaccine hesitancy, or if you haven't? 
FN: The VA, they haven't vaccinated a lot of veterans. I know in our region, we've done over 100,000 or 
something like that. The veteran demographics, you have to look at that. A lot of them are conservative, 
so some of the miseducation out there about vaccinations is definitely strong in that population of 
people. It's not even a white or a black thing. It's even in black communities. There's a lot of kind of 
miseducation as well. There's a lot of skepticism about the vaccination. So, on one end, you have those 
that are driven by political skepticism that tells them, "Well, you know, the vaccine, oh, it's whatever, 
whatever." Then on the other end, with some of the other demographics, minorities and stuff like that, 
their issues come from kind of past-- things that have happened in the past, and their distrust for 
medicine in general. That makes them not just want to be the first. They think they're guinea pigs and 
this and that. So, yeah, we do have that issue here. A lot of times what you see when they're asking you 
to say, "Hey, come get a vaccine," is because you are allotted a certain number and you make your 
appointments. If people don't show up or people cancel or they change their mind, those vaccines are 
gonna be wasted. A lot of times they just try to give it out to whoever is available at that point to get it 
because we don't want to waste any of the vaccines 'cause they're so precious. So, yeah, there is a lot of 
skepticism in the veteran population. I think it's a mixture of a lot of factors. Just the population itself, I 
don't think they're very pro-big government, medicine, the whole thing like that. We have to do a lot of 
teaching and reassuring on that. That goes back to what I said with the CHF and the diabetes. You 
normally have to appeal to who are the gatekeepers of health in those families, in those communities, 
whether it's a mother or a son or a daughter, and try to appeal to them to say, "Hey, you need to get your 
dad to take his vaccine because x, y and z." For black people, I could say, "It's killing us at a higher rate. 
We need to get this. If it's so bad, then look at all these”-- You can say, “Look at all these Caucasian 
doctors. They're getting vaccinated at a high rate. So, if it's something bad." A lot of that it just goes 
back to just teaching and reassuring people that it is something beneficial for them. 
AG: Right, that's an excellent point. The vaccine hesitancy has really exposed not only political divides, 
but this deep sort of history of essentially medical malpractice that has engendered some really 
legitimate skepticism of. I wonder, Franklin, are there any lessons that you're taking forward from this 
pandemic period? 
[1:00:40] Well, I think on a personal note is just to appreciate the time that you have with your family 
and friends because all these people are gone, and most of them otherwise would not have been gone if 
this thing had never happened. So, the lesson is just don't take anything for granted. I don't plan anything 
too far ahead 'cause Lord knows what plans I had for 2020 [chuckles]. It all got thrown out the window. 
Just kinda taking things day by day, living in the moment and not getting too far ahead of yourself and 
assuming things are going to be there. I've seen a lot of people lose people, and I've had some friends 
that were impacted by it and family members and things like that. It's definitely just to cherish the time 
that you're in. 
B: What do you see your role as in providing care for patients? 
Library of Congress Archie Green Folklife Fellowship 
2020012, Nursing America's Veterans 
19 
FN: What I try to do is impact what the frontline staff nurses are doing by guiding them to make sure 
that we're doing the best, whatever is the best thing to do for our veterans, making sure the nurses are 
happy, and that is relative to what happy is in their work environment, making sure that we're innovating 
and trying to provide all the resources needed so that the end result of that is that the type of care that 
we're providing to our veterans is just the top notch and high quality. Even though I'm not sticking an IV 
in a patient's arm, I still feel my role is very important in making sure that those who are doing that 
know how to do it properly and they're doing it for the right reasons. 
B: And how do you think that's changed in the past seven years, if at all, since you started nursing? 
FN: I think when I first came in, like I said, it was more focused on me and trying not to mess up, and as 
I transitioned, it became on trying to impact other people. Now I think I'm just doing that on a larger 
scale, where I can assist our whole organization in providing the best care for our veterans and making 
sure that when they come into our hospital, that they are being cared for by competent and people that 
actually enjoy what they're doing. So, it's to me just an evolution of my career, is the higher I try to 
ascend is really just to have more of an impact on the type of care that's provided to veterans. 
AG: Franklin, do you see nurses having a role as well, in terms of at the societal level, in health care 
equity or advocacy?  
FN: You mean on a political level, or trying to make changes, or? 
AG: Yeah, political or sociological or if the work that you're doing at the bedside has that ripple effect, 
maybe? 
FN: I think it's getting there. I think, historically, nurses as a profession has been passive to physicians, 
and maybe in the past 15 or 20 years, it's starting to transition into more of its own autonomous field of 
medicine. There have been groups, obviously, throughout the history of nursing that have been fighting 
for us to have a voice in change, but as times are going on, nurses are starting to see that kind of come to 
fruition. I know the American Nurses Association, they they go to Congress and they lobby just like 
every other group does, and they're starting to have a voice 'cause we're a very large workforce. We're 
the largest workforce of medical providers in the nation. But more than not, most nurses don't view 
themselves as societal impactors, because most of them just want to take care of their patients and go 
home to their families. But I think as newer generations are coming in and the focus on leadership 
development and the focus on kind of having a voice is kind of shifting that. The newer generations of 
nurses are more outspoken about things, and they're more likely to speak up on behalf of different issues 
that are going on in society. I think that's something that's encouraging as we move forward. We have a 
power that we're not-- I don't want to say we're not using it to the fullest of our potential, just due to 
people not really being geared towards that type of-- whether it's activism or whatever you want to call 
it. There are a lot of people in that work, but I think nursing as a profession could definitely be more 
impactful and trying to advocate for the nation's health. 
B: Are there any services you would like to see provided or improved for veterans? 
[1:05:58] FN: For veterans, just definitely more access, more access, as much access as possible. I think 
the VA does a lot of stuff, provides a lot of services for them. A lot of times, a lot of them get lost in the

shuffle of all the different layers of things you have to go through to get that access. I think it'd be 
beneficial for them to make it easier for them to get their benefits and not have to submit so many papers 
and kinda jump through all these hoops, 'cause a lot of the veterans aren't in-- not a lot of them, but 
there's a population of veterans that are, for example, like our homeless veterans. There's a high 
percentage of homelessness in the veteran demographic. Just providing ways that don't require all this 
structure and paperwork for them to get health care and for them to get benefits and for them to be 
registered, I think is something that they can definitely work on. 
B: Do you think, similarly, that there are ways that the VA could be improving or providing more 
support for nurses? 
FN: Yes, definitely with utilizing the resources that we have to celebrate the nurses. I think one of the 
key distinctions between private sector facilities and the VA is that the private sector really invest a lot 
of money in celebrating their nurses, whether it's during Nurses Week or just giving them funds to do a 
lot of events that kind of are centered around letting the nurses feel like they are appreciated. We have 
somewhat of that, but because of the rules and limitations of funding for celebrations and things that are 
set for in the VA, we have to be creative in the ways that we do that. I think that impacts retention. As 
small as it is, just providing maybe a gift to a staff member during a certain week, or providing some 
high-end meals or a nice bag or whatever goes a long way. If you're looking at your colleagues at private 
sector hospitals where they're getting all these things throughout the year, that really makes it hard for us 
to compete on that level, because these for-profit organizations really invest money into making their 
nurses feel like they're appreciated. 
B: Do you have a professional mentor? 
FN: Yeah, I have several. I have at least three or four people that I can go to for different things, 
different needs. I talk to everybody. If I can get something from somebody, whether it's a staff nurse can 
tell me something, or even somebody that's not a nurse. I do have about two or three people that I can sit 
down and talk to about different issues I'm having or any advice or career advice or things like that. I 
think that's definitely important, and I try to be that for other people that request that of me as well. 
B: Have you seen the VA change at all? 
FN: My god, yes. Yes, definitely. It's improved a lot. It's been improving. Even when I came here, 
people were saying that it was starting to improve. I don't know what it was like back in the early 2000s, 
but apparently not so well [chuckles]. There's an effort to just innovate and to try to provide the best 
they can for the vets, and I truly can say that that is something I have seen. It's improved a lot. Now, 
there's still issues and things like that, but there's been a lot of different innovations, especially from my 
perspective within nursing on a national level with the VA. 
AG: Can you share one or two examples of some of the innovations that you've seen? 
[1:10:07] FN: They're mostly related to practice. On the national level, there's been a strong emphasis on 
the use of research and evidence-based practice across the VA. One of the things they did this past year, 
they partnered with Ohio State School of Nursing, and they've been working with one of the pillars of 
evidence-based practice in nursing. I think her name is Dr. Bernadette Melnyk. She literally wrote the

book on evidence-based practice. They have a program in that Ohio State School of Nursing that the VA 
has been sending hundreds of nurses to. They sent hundreds in 2020 and they're planning on sending 
hundreds in this year, if not already. I was one of the people that they sent there. It's a five-day course 
that just teaches you on conducting a literature search and finding best practice, applying it at the 
bedside level. It's not a cheap course. Obviously cost them a lot of money, but they invested that and we 
were in that course with VA nurses from across the nation, [unintelligible] and different parts of the 
country. I think just things like that, and investing into the type of care that we want. Providing those 
resources is something that I've seen them really, really focus on and trying to stay ahead of the curve 
and keep up with all the private sector opportunities that other hospitals have. 
AG: Franklin, thanks so much. This has been so wonderful and informative. Is there anything that you 
want to add that we maybe haven't addressed yet? 
FN: No, I think we covered everything. 
AG: Oh, wonderful. Thank you both so much for your time today. I'm so grateful.
