Sung with great applause by MANCHESTER & jENNINGS. 
Good evening to you one and all, 
We're glad to find you well; 
Coincidences will happen, 
And of one we're going to tell. 
We were slaves once in the sunny South, 
But the war has set us free ; 
We're now elected congressmen, 
From the State of Tennessee.

As you can see,

From the State of Tennesee.

Extended by the Sam, 
To address a

Along with Pat McCann.

For us two elected congressmen 
That comes from Tennessee.

DISGUSTED LOVERS. 
Sang by EMERSON & CLARK with great succeis. 
I'VE just came here to see my love; 
She's just inside the door ;• 
I 
only wished her love proved true, 
And faithful evermore, 
I 
hear that there's another chap 
That always comes sneaking around, 
If ever I 
get hold of him, 
His head will kiss the ground. 
Cuouns. 
He'd better go it rather slow, 
I'll catch him on the fly ; 
For this is what I 
want to know, 
Whe gets her, him or 
I 
wonder who that fellow is, 
Comes loafing around about ? 
I'll assassinate him, you can bet, 
If I 
can find him out. 
I 
know he comes to see my love. 
He thinks he's very shy, . 
But I'll go in, I 
want to know 
Who gets her, him or I. 
He'd better go, etc. 
Now tell me how you came to go 
To see the girl I 
love ? 
Don't talk so sassy to me now, 
For she's my turtle dove. 
She says she won't have either one, 
So come now let- us fly, 
And let's be . 
friends: for surely we 
Don't-want her; you or I. 
He'd better go, etc. 
TROITBLES OF A SONG AND DANCE MAN. 
Original Act by MANCHESTER & JENNINGS. 
No longer talk about your men 
Of funny song and dance; 
For we can lay way over them all, 
If you'll give us a 
chance. 
There's dancing in our heels and toes 
And music in our chins, 
You can bet we are thoroughbreds, 
Although we're thick and thin. 
CHORUS. 
My name is Singing Gus, 
While mine is Dancing Jim, 
You bet we are two thoroughbreds; 
Although we're thick and thin. 
If any one that's here to night 
Would like a 
photograph of us. 
Just call on Dancing Jimmy here, 
Or else to Singing Gus, 
Some say that we both look alike, 
And some say we are twins; 
You bet we are two thoroughbreds, 
,Although we're thick and . 
thin. 
My name is singing Gus, etc.

CARRIE WITH THE GOLDEN HAIR. 
Words by Elliott. 
Music by H. P. Danks. 
Music at Dobnieyers, Cincinnati, 0. 
As sung by Fred. B. Naylor. 
SYitEET Carrie's eyes are like the light, 
Of stars that bless the quiet night, . 
Her forehead wears the spotless hue 
Of morning glories bathed with dew. 
The petals of fond lilies form 
Her cuning fingers soft and warm, 
Her cheeks that dimple in her smile, 
Bear pink that blossom all the while. 
CHORUS. 
Of all the bells within the dells, 
There's none I 
see that can compare, 
With Carrie dear, when sun light clear, 
Plays in her wavy, golden hair. 
._ Her tresses dim the lovelist dyes 
That trail along the evening skies, 
The riches pansies down her veins 
ReVeals the softest purple stains. 
A 
path of rarest roses leaves, 
As each darling word she whispers cleaves, 
And on its lucious gates I 
see, 
A 
sweet to charm the royal bee. 
Of all the bells, etc.

CHAMPION ROAST. 
Music by Wm. B. 
WooD 
Words by F. T. WARD. 
ON 
a 
fair afternoon take a 
walk on Broadway, 
Strange sights yot. Will see to lead you astray; 
In front of hotels you will notice the sport, 
Dressed up in snide clothes in Baxter Street bouglit. 
They travel Broadway from morning till night, 
And can pipe off a 
Rube at a 
half block's sight, 
Your acquaintance they'll make, of money the: , 
boast; 
give them plenty o room as they're all on a 
roast. 
To bails and parties they're there all the same, 
For some solid guy to give them a 
game; 
Their aim it is graft or some one to brace, 
They work it up fine on the strengh of their face. 
In the supper or wine-room they stick like a 
leech, 
And nurse everything that come within reach, 
Your health they will drink every time with a 
toast, 
Give them plenty of room as they're all on a 
roast. 
In bar-rooms they'll weigh you, your pockets they'll 
weed, 
The free lunch they slaughter and give it great speed 
If you ask'them to drink, they never refuse, 
Five fingers each time of solid old booze. 
Now take my advice whenever you're out, 
Always keep your eyes skined when them tramps 
are about, 
Stag the Rube is the by-word they use that the most, 
Give them plenty of room for there all on a 
roast. 
Sung by DELEHANTY & HENGLER'S MINSTRELS 
DARLING little Gertie, 
Winsome, bright, and fair, 
Sweeter than the blossoms, 
In the sunny air; 
Music of the brooklet, 
Melody of birds, 
Live within her laughter, 
And her loving words. 
CHORUS. 
Darling little Gertie. 
Ever fair and bright 1 
Sunny be thy pathway, 
Idol of delight! 
May the kindly angels 
Guide thy little feet, 
When life's storm of sorrow, 
Round thee sadly beat I 
Ah! darling little Gertie, 
Fairy of our home, 
Joy and sunlight follow, 
Where thy steps may roam; 
Where thy steps may roam. 
Fairy of our home, 
Joy and sunlight follow, darling, 
Fairy of our home. 
Darling little Gertie, 
Sunshine of our days, 
How we love to cherish 
All her loving ways 
Dearer than the dew-drops, 
To the fading flower, 
Is our little rosebud, 
Blooming in our bower, 
Ah! darling, etc. 
Original by the Late JAMES BRADLEY. 
Good evening friends, I'll sing to you, 
A 
song and dance which is true, 
I 
loved a 
girl whose name was Lew, 
But now she's ran away. 
She could sing just like a 
bird, 
The sweetest voice you ever heard, 
Her lover too was so absurd, 
And you can always hear me 
CHORUS. 
I 
think I 
made a 
big mistake, 
By falling in love with Lousia Flake, 
She ran away, and gave me the shake, 
With a 
dark complected coon. 
Louisa's ma don't feel content 
For marrying that coon without her consent, 
When she heard the news in a 
fit she went, 
And made a 
terrible grumble. 
I 
know I 
was left in the cold, 
And also I 
was terrible sold, 
I'm to blame myself, I 
scold, 
For causing such a 
trouble. 
I 
think I 
made, etc.

DOWN AMONG THE DAISIES.. 
Written by W. 
A: 
HUNTLEY, banjoist, for Wm.: H. MoRroN: 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low: 
Sitting with my darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go: 
There I 
meet my darling every Summer's day 
And the leaflets nodding up above 
Were the only ones that list to what we'd .say, 
As we whispered o'er our tales of love. 
CHORUS. 
Down among the daisies, by the running stream, 
Where the waters ripple soft and low; 
Sitting by ray darling, in a 
happy dream, 
Heedless of the hours that come and go. 
Down among the daisies we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage by the stream; 
Naught will ever come to break the happy spell, 
Break the happy glimmer of our dream. 
Days may come and go, like flowers that lMo&m and. 
die,

THE DEVIL'S IN NEW 3ERSEY. 
Composed and sung by P. J. DOWNEY. 
LAST Sunday morn I 
rose up, 
And I 
feeling kind of merry ; 
Says I 
PH have a 
good time, 
So I 
crossed the Jersey ferry. 
But never will I 
do the same, 
The consequence was frightening. 
But what can you expect of one, 
Fllied up with Jersey lightening. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you talk of this you talk of that, 
You talk of places nosey, 
Bu by the—no, I 
will i 
ot swear— 
The devil's in New Jersey. 
I 
ran through mud up to my eyes, 
I 
never yet was lazy ; 
A 
big policeman scooped me in, 
And swore that I 
was crazy. 
I 
was surrounded in the cell, 
By mosquitos a- flying, 
When morning came, from loss of bloo .
1, 
I 
thought I 
was a- dying. 
Oh, you talk of this, etc. 
When morning came, before the judge, 
He looked on me with pity; 
Says he, young man, the sentence is, 
One hour to leavethe city. 
I 
did not wait to hear the rest, 
You bet I 
wasn't noisy, 
When I 
arrived in York I 
cried : 
May the devil shoot New Jersey. 
Oh, you talk of this, etc. 
When I 
got home, my wife along 
'With a 
big club was waiting, 
She said to lay a 
hand on me 
her tender heart was breaking. 
We had it up and down the floor, 
At last I 
cried for mercy, 
She yelled you fool, go anywhere, 
But keep away from Jersey. 
Oh, you talk of this, etc.

ELLA, MY DARLING. 
Words by ALICE LEWERS. 
Music by JOHN T. 
KELLY. 
Sung with immense success by Thos. 0. DAVIS, in the 
" 
Exiles." 
I 
have struggled for years with the world and its trials, 
That I 
might get back to the girl I 
adore; 
My heart swelled with pride as the ship ploughed the ocean, 
That brought me still nearer to Erin's green shore. 
How I 
longed for to clasp that fair girl to my bosom, 
To bask in the smiles that I 
thought were in store; 
But the cabin was gone, and the moor was deserted, 
Sweet Ella, my darling, I 
will see thee no more. 
As I 
gazed on the ruin, the chill, dreary night wind, 
Sighed through the vale with a 
dirge soft and low ; 
My hope hath all fled, no fond voice to welcome, 
Oh, how can my poor heart withstand the sad blow. 
Where now is the sweet face that well 
remember, 
That beamed full of joy in the ivy clad door; 
The stillness around me all tells the sad story, 
And Ella, my darling, I'll see thee no more. 
The path to the glen where so often we wandered, 
Hath felt not thy footfall for many a 
day ; 
All the scenes that hath witnessed our love for each other, 
Have gone with thee, Ella, in time's slow decay. 
Oh, what would I 
give for a 
glance of your eye, love, 
To cheer me again as it used to of yore; 
Mavourneen, thou hast gone and left me in sorrow, 
Sweet Ella, my darling, I'll see thee no more. 
Sung with great success by Miss FLORA MoonE. 
Satan tempted Eve, 
Eve tempted man, 
Hadn't been for the mercy of the Lord, 
We'd all been cussed in the land. 
Nigger man he picks cotton, 
Little bees sip the honey, 
Colored man he work all day long; 
And white man gets the money. 
CHORUS. 
Case he's a 
high born liver Daniel, 
Daniel, Daniel; 
Re's a 
high born liver Daniel, 
I'm going to the promised land. 
Talk about good eating, 
Your oysters and your clams, 
If you want somethink good for to eat, 
Just get hold of a 
sweet ham, 
Talk about good buckwheat cakes, 
If you want them good and done, 
7ust slap 'em on to a 
nigger man's heel, 
And hold 'em up to the sun. 
Case he's a 
high born liver, etc. 
As sung by JOHN TUDOR. 
The heart from this bosom has lately been stad, 
By a

Her feet are a

Her father's a

But him she does hammer, 
In an artistic manner; 
She plays on the pianner

With a 
tooth-brush I 
fan her, 
This charming young girl. 
Her .moire antique pull-back cost something immense. 
Her hat, gloves and parasol forty-six cents, 
She shall be a 
lady, like Bridget O'Grady, 
For I've got the till and don't mind the expense. 
Her front name, etc. 
Her mouth—well, it stretches from ear to ear, 
A 
first-class provision store it does disappear; 
I've never carress'd her for I 
have a 
fear, 
I'd sure to be drovin'd if I 
ventured to near.

I

When the old ship Zion was passing by, 
I

You rise up in de morning, 
And you look up yonder in de sky; 
And there you see the eagle's nest, 
And yar de young ones cry;

If you get over to Jordon, 
And you don't see me over dar; 
Send ma a

Likewise a

And what you 'speet I

A beckoning along to me.

I'm weary of heartaches and weary of fears, 
Weary of moaning and weary of pain, 
Weary, so weary, of hoping in vain; 
Weary, so weary, the burdens of life, 
Weary of toiling and weary of strife,

Weary, so weary, and longing for light. 
Chorus. 
I'm weary, so weary, the burdens of life, 
Weary of toiling and weary of strife, 
I'm weary of parting and weary of night, 
Weary, so weary, and longing for light. 
Weary, so weary, of waiting alone, 
I'm weary of asking—receiving a 
stone, 
Weary of watching and weary of jeers, 
Weary, so weary, of taunts and of sneers; 
Weary, so weary, but sometime I'll rest, 
Dreamlessly sleeping, hands closed over breast, 
Ali! no more to sorrow or no more to weep, 
Only to lie down and quietly sleep.

As sung with great success at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre

Oh, the rose of Kentucky and me, 
Long ago old massa set us free; 
I'll tell you what did happen in her good old mother's cabin 
To the rose of Kentucky and me. 
On the banks of the Ohio River, 
Where the winters are so cold the darkeys shiver; 
One night about eight, we joined the married state. 
The rose of Kentucky and rue. 
CHORUS. 
On the banks of the river, that old muddy river, 
She lived on the banks of the river; 
And one night about eight, we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
When they tried to win my Rose away from me, 
My wife alone she said she'd be ; 
Yet their vanity she flattered, and their hearts she always shat. 
tered 
When they tried to play that game on me, you see. 
Her voice filled this darkey full of glee, 
She's as merry and as busy as a 
bee ; 
Wove when I 
look at her, she's Pack, but that's no matter, 
She's just the shade I'd have my darling be. 
On the banks of the river, etc. 
Since I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife, 
We have lived together, free from care or strife ; 
And it's natural to suppose, we had a 
little Rose, 
For so sweetly flowed the summer of our life. 
Yet the winter of our days will come, alas I 
When spring, summer and autumn, too, will pass; 
Hand in hand we'll glide away, and PH bless the nappy day 
When I

THE LITTLE PLAIN GOLD RING.

ARR.AH, when I 
was a

At the age of twenty-three,

And one May morn in Spring, 
She gave to me this token, boys, 
This little plain gold ring. 
Fond remembrance bring, [sym.]

When the neighbors one and all, 
With hope and sunshine on their face, 
So pleasantly did call.

And how they danced, 
The presents they did bring;

In this little plain gold ring.

Don't tease you mamma so ; 
Oh, mother, dear, I 
will, 
It's wrong to tease, I 
know. 
Now, be a 
good little boy, 
That wood right home you'll bring, 
Shout aloud with joy, 
Sing, my child, now sing. 
Don't get weary, 
Don't get weary, children, 
Don't get weary, 
For we're going home. 
Oh, mother, I 
will be good, 
And try and do what's right, 
I'll always come home soon, 
And won't stay out at night. 
Now that's the way to talk, 
In flue or rainy weather, 
Oh, now let's take a 
walk, 
And joyous sing together. 
I 
met a 
red- head girl who came from Jersey City, 
With dashing style and winning smile, 
While ow. the other day ; 
A perfect Venus too, so charming and so witty, 
With voice, I 
own, of silver tone, 
She t 
ruled a 
merry lay, 
She sang so clear and sweetly, 
My brain was in a 
whirl ; 
And it broke my heart, almost to part, 
From my red head Jersey girl. 
I 
proffered her my arm, ' twas then and there accepted, 
We strolled along and still her song * 
T ruled forth with rippling grace; 
'Twas plain enough to see with love I 
was affected, 
My brain was turned, my heart it burned, 
With love naught could erase. 
She sang so clear and sweetly, etc. 
She left me at the ferry, a 
business call she pleaded, 
And with a 
sigh she said good-bye, 
Hoped we would meet again ; 
As from my loving gaze her form at last receded, 
I 
was thunderstruck and cursed my luck, 
I 
was bewildered then. 
SPOKEN. —I 
discovered that the young lady while hanging on 
my arm had stolen my watch and pocketbook. 
For a 
few min 
utes I 
cursed and swore at a terrible rate, but I afterwardF 
realized there was no sense in making a 
very strong " kick " in 
the matter because— 
She sang so clear and sweetly, ete.

Sung by FOLEY & SHEFFER, with ininieme SUCCCSS. 
As I 
was a-cro3siug yonder field, 
A 
snake he stung me on the heel; 
Turned right around to do our best, 
Slapped our foot in a 
hornet's nest. 
CHORUS. 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, little children; 
Wasn't Olt a 
mighty day; 
When us two uigs were born. 
What kind of shoes does the angels wear ? 
They don't wear any, for they walk in the air ; 
They walk in the air until somebody knocks, 
Then we put all the niggers in the missionary 
box. 
CHORUS. 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day, little children ; 
Wasn't that a 
mighty day,

THE OLD VILLAGE BUM. 
Composed and sung by P. J. DOW,NEY. 
Am:— Old Kitchen Floor. 
oinetimes, when l'm musing, my memory flies back, 
To pleasures and sorrows in life's stormy track, 
There's one thing comes to me I 
cannot repress, 
Those days are long gone, yet to me they are fresh. 
A poor, lonely stranger to our village came, 
His clothes they were seedy, his walk it was lame; 
We gathered around him, and just out of thn, 
We christened him Billy, the old village bum. 
We 
gathered around him, and just out of fun, 
We christened him Billy, the old village bum. 
His labor was useful to neighbors around. 
Give him but a 
meal, and his sorrows were drowned. 
His shape it was known to most all hi the di‘ce. 
The children would smile at his good-natured face. 
When we were a-playing, if things were unfair. 
They soon would be righted if he were but there. 
AVhen strangers chastised us, how quick they would. run 
If we'd call our Billy, the old village burn. 
(Repeat last two i,e-.) 
At last, cruel war it came unto our land, 
He was not the last with a 
gun in his hand. 
The day I 
remember, it made us all cry. 
When he came around for to bid us good-by, 
The war it was ended—he came in the cars— 
One poor arm was gone, and he covered with scars. 
Although he was crippled, we never could shun 
Our poot honest Billy, the old village bum. 
(Repeat last two line: 
His wounds came against him—his age helped them on, 
His limbs they were feeble, his strength it was gone. 
We brought him a 
doctor, and gave him a 
bed. 
But death came at last, and poor Billy was dead. 
The people to pacify children did try; 
But thinking of Billy, they could not help cry. 
By a 
tree in our grave-yard, just out of the sum, 
We 
laid our poor Billy, the old village bum. 
(Repeat last two lints.) 
THE OLD MAN'S 
DRUNK AGAIN. 
Words and Music by W ILL HAYS. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
You've no doubt heard the song 
Of " Father dear, come home," 
And the fate of hungry little Ben, 
Who sent for him to come. 
How the old man usen to " 
And cause the family pain, 
But he let up for a 
little while, 
And then got drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
We've given him up for gone, 
He's lying in the lane, 
And almost everybody knows 
The old man's drunk again. 
He takes his morning nip, 
And loafs about the door ; 
He told his family more than once 
That he would drink no more; 
But then he wonld forget 
From " benzine " to abstain, 
The police they would say 
The old man's drunk again. 
We've given him up, ett. 
Ho'd smash poor mother's nose, 
And upset brother Ned, 
And drive us all into the street, 
Then tumble into bed; 
And when he'd be asleep, 
We'd go back and remain. 
Until he woke and left the house; 
Te come home drunk again. 
We've given him up, etc. 
THE OLD MAN'S DRUNK AGAIN. 
Continued. 
Oh, father, dear, come home, 
Stop drinking like a 
sow, 
You've drank away the beds and stove, 
Don't swallow up the cow; 
Oh! don't abuse the boys, 
And cause poor mother pain, 
Or we'll rebel and " go for you," 
When you get drunk again.

As sung by JOHNSON & BRUNO. 
OH! kind folks watch our motion, 
And give us a 
little chance, 
We'll raise a 
great commotion 
With our latest song and dance;

For sorrow, for we're known as 
The Happy Limber Nigs. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! white folks watch de motion of our feet. [Break.] 
To please you all we are bound to do it neat. [Break.] 
if we can only please you, 
When we make a 
little noise; 
It will give us satisfaction, 
When we try to please the boys. 
At sundown, when our work was done, 
How gay us Nigs would be; 
Its then we used ter habe our tun, 
id de gals, so gay and free; 
And since we left that good old home, 
We love to dance our jigs; 
And happier boys cannot be found 
Than us, lively ,* Limber Nigs.

What ? no ! it canna be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh, Heavens, he is saddened and weary; 
See the tears how the course down his cheeks ! 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And his heart for relief vainly seeks. 
Cnonus. 
For he's old and helpless, and feeble, 
The days of his youth have gone by. 
Then over the hill to the poor-house, 
He wanders alone there to die. 
kb, me! on that old doorstep yonder, 
I've sat with my babes on my knee, 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lilly with prattle so weet ! 
God knows how their father has loved then, 
But they've driven him out in the street.

OVER THE HILL TO THE POOR-HOUSE. 
Continuecl 
It's long years since my Mary was taken, 
My faithful affectionate wife; 
Since then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
And the light has died out of my life. 
lhe boys grew to manhood; he gave them 
A 
deed for the farm ! aye, and more, 
He gave them this house they were born in ! 
And now he's turn'd out from its door. 
For he's old, etc. 
Oh, children! loved children ! yet bear. 
me, 
I 
have journeyed along on life's stage ; 
With the hope that you all would be near me, 
To comfort and cheer my old age; 
My life blood I'd gladly have given, 
To shield and protect you! but hark! 
Though my heart breaks, I'll say it's you've driven 
Me out here to die in the dark. 
For he's old, etc. 
But, perhaps, they'll live happier without me: 
Farewell, dear old home, ah! farewell! 
Each pathway and tree here about me, 
Some memory precious can tell: 
Well! the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn; 
Then over the hill from the poor- house, 
Next Spring the old man shall be borne. 
For he's old, etc.

Behold dese old time heroes, 
Wid hair as white as snow ; 
We fit wid Hickory Jackson, 
In Louisiana, low, low, low. 
We waited on de Generals, 
An' kept the powder dry. 
And stayed way back (-tar in de rear— 
We didn't care to die, die, die. 
CHORUS. 
Den clar de track, please stand back, 
De old vets' mighty glad; 
Dress yourself in bran new clothes, 
Bring along your dad, dad, dad. 
Den hist your umbrellas high, 
De wind ain't gwine to blow. 
Hush your month when old folks talk 
Of eighty years ago, ago, ago. 
Dere was de Brittish army, 
We give 'ern iron beans; 
Wen we lay behind the cotton bales, 
Down in New Orleans, leans, leans. 
De colored troops fought nobly, 
De guns went al-a-ba-zam, 
We knocked de dust plum off de heels, 
Of General Buckingham, ham, ham. 
Now, pay attention, children, 
And keep your shoestrings loose; 
It's seldom that you ever hear 
A 
quack quack from a 
goose. 
We're just like old tough tnrkies, 
We sleep all day and night, 
We raise our feathers mountain high, 
When. we start into fight.

Down in the dear old cot ; 
His smiling children on his knee,

With flowers the hill and plain;

But the seat beneath the tree is gone, 
And our home has lost its charm.

PERPETUAL MOTION. 
As originally done by QUEEN & W EST,, at the San Francisco 
Minstrels, New York City. 
ALL around this blessed town we run for infoalatioth 
Trying to discover if there's any new sensation, 
Politics and accidents, and scandalizing too, 
These are all the same to us as long as they are new. 
C ORUS. 
Here and there and everywhere, we'll 
very quickly 
prove, 
Do what we will we are never still, but always on the 
move, 
Here and there and everywhere, you'll see at a 
glance, 
Do what we will we're never still, 
but always on the 
dance. 
Mr. Beecher asked us if we would be his mate, 
He would preach, and we would have to pass arol;nd 
the plate , 
To sing a 
comic song or two, to please the congregation 
Anything is fair, said he, to raise a 
good sensation. 
Here and there, etc. 
A 
lessee of a 
theatre, in manner most emphatic, 
Told us that we must not dance, because it was dramatic 
Such petty jealousy, of course, arises from vexation, 
'cause variety shows are all the go they feel a 
queer 
sensation. 
Here and there, etc. 
Now we must be going, but on some other day, 
About the great sensation we'll have some more to say. 
So let us hope that -we have gained your smiles and ap-
probation, 
For we have done our best to raise a 
laughable sensation.

When I

When I'm six feet under the turf; 
I

And worked me for every nickle I 
was worth. 
Yon said I 
might look but I 
musn't touch, 
Which put me in such a 
dilemma, 
Oh, there's one little favor I 
ask you, will you, 
See that my grave is whitewashed every summer ?

Oh, but pards, you cannot say I 
ever kicked.

manner, while the interior portion of my anatomy 
stale: sangniih, 
But the idistic eye water continues to flow, no matter 
what endeavors I 
may use to the contrary, 
For the female personage, so endeared to me by mutual 
ties of affection, 
Whom it is very probable will never greet my vision any 
more. 
Chorus (Poetically called a 
refrain.) 
The night vision (commonly called a 
dream) of ati,toon 
has been rudely torn from my bosom, and is 
defunct, 
I 
try to give pleasing facial exhibitions while my prin-
cipal anatomical organs suffer severely; 
But the recollections of the days gone by will rise up 
in front of me like a 
panorama of the past, 
For her nibs who made her hasty exit with another ex-
ponent of the aged Southern darkey.

TWO BL 
Ion.- AND TANS. 
Written by BARLOW BROTHERS, and sung by them with success 
at the Olympic Theatre, New York. 
We just came here frdm sunny Alabam, 
Our names are Slippery Dick and Carless Sam, 
On the light fantastic toe, 
I 
can tell you we're not slow; 
"We're two India rubber, gum shoe— 
Black and tans. 
We're happy when the music it does play, 
And we always try to drive dull care away, 
And with us you -will agree, 
When our movements you do see, 
We're two India rubber, gum shoe— 
Black and tans. 
In the morning when we rise, we feel so gay 
That we both commence to dancing right away, 
When the people underneath, 
They commence to grit the teeth, 
But they hate to tell us for— 
To go away. 
For they know that we are always full of fun ; 
If they try to catch us, off we both tlo run, 
But we'll bid you all adieu. 
Before we go we'll shake a 
shoe, 
We're two India rubber, gum shoe— 
Black and tans.
