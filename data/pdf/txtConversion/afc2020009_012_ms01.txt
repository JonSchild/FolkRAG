JARED HUFFMAN, Furniture repair
Katy Clune  0:00
All right, I hit the button we're recording. So it is January 22. Correct?
Jared Huffman  0:04
Oh yes, it is.
KC  0:06
Katy Clune here with Julia Gartrell at Y and J furniture in Durham, North Carolina. And Jared, 
why don't you start us off by telling us your name and what you do.
JH 0:14
My name is Jared Huffman, and I am the owner of Y and J furniture. And overall, pretty much 
run production throughout the whole shop and keep it organized and keep things moving and 
whatnot. That's typically my job duties and pay--- I pay a lot of bills too.
KC  0:26
Before we get to where we---- how you got to Y and J, tell us where you were born and where 
you grew up.
JH 0:31
So I was born in Columbia, South Carolina. And I lived in Winston-Salem [NC], but I spent all 
of--- most of my time up in New Hampshire area. And so I've lived up there for a while, and we 
came back here. But yeah, so North Carolina, and Northeast, that's where I really spent most of 
my time.
KC  0:46
How did you get into the furniture business?
JH 0:48
I got into it--- it's funny, I've always enjoyed trees. I always--- I read that book,Tthe Hidden Life 
of Trees.
KC  0:52
Oh yeah
JH 0:56
And I always thought that was really interesting and how they were, the wood was kind of alive 
all the time and things like that. So I thought that was really interesting. And then as you start 
looking at furniture, and you start seeing what it's made out of, and the trees and the wood and 
the sap wood, and all these other things that come with it. There's more of a history to it, and
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
how they put it together and the joinery and then you start kind of seeing the period pieces and
all that stuff. And you kind of get like a little bit of fascination with it. But you gotta like
woodworking though. You do. you gotta like it. So...
KC  2:00
Did you grow up doing woodworking or was it in your family?
JH 2:03
Well, my dad was a general contractor. So it was like, not this type of woodworking but more
construction stuff, things like that. Yeah, yeah, so not the--- I didn't do like Lowell, Lowell [who
works at Y and J], he's been in this industry since he was a kid doing repairs. And there's some
other guys that--- it's interesting, you know, you meet those people that have been doing this for
so long, like James and he doesn't really go out and buy some of the tools he just goes out and
makes like the tools that he might need. Because back then, like I've heard stories of my
grandfather---- you need a table, you just go cut a tree down. And that's how you make a table
back then. And so that's how they're kind of, you know, raised and so that's.... But once you learn
that stuff, that's kind of what was really cool about it when I started hearing that like oh my
goodness, you know, back then you go and cut down a tree, you make your table and you know,
the joinery and all the other stuff that comes with it was kind of interesting, a little fascinating,
really. So I like it a lot though.
Julia Gartrell 3:03
Do you remember the first piece of furniture you built for yourself?
JH 3:07
Um, yeah, it was a small chest of drawers that I did. It was kind of crude in the beginning. I'm
actually not a patient person. And so you need to have patience for this. But I like the history of
it. I like the period pieces and things like that, that you know, that comes with it all. I'm more
fascinated by that stuff, than, at this point--- I love doing repairs, but building a piece of
furniture. It's kind of like a whole 'nother animal you're working with like, new wood and like,
you know, all this other stuff. But I like turning though like on the lathe. I love doing that. That's
a lot of fun. But when it comes to like building, I kind of like doing the repairs and all the other
stuff we got. I like that a lot.
KC  3:50
Do you have a repair shop at home? Or like a wood shop at home? Or do you do it all here?
JH 3:54
No, I do it all here now. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, so having a shop like this, you can just grab
everything you need. And so, yeah.
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  4:01
So tell us how you got to own Y and J.
JH 4:05
I was always friends with the original [owner]--- with Matt Yarborough. And in this industry,
you kind of know other people that you know, who do repair work and stuff like that. You kind
of either you're friends with them or their complete enemies. That's really how it goes. Because
but I've always had like, I was working at another place in Raleigh doing furniture repairs, and
then I met Mr. Yarborough and we hit it off pretty well. And after a while, you know, he was----
his thing was he didn't really have anyone to pass it down to. So he has his daughters and things
like that. But they were--- have kids and family living up in the north. So he, you know, didn't
really know what to do. So he said, You know, I guess we'll just shut it down. But, and he asked
me he's like, hey, do you want to buy it? And I said--- and it was right during the pandemic,
actually, in March, when it first started. So we started talking about it in January and I said you
know what, I guess why not take a jump and see if we can do this? And so, took it over and and
during the whole thing that's happened. I've hired a lot more employees and things like that. So
it's been it's been, been good though, I like it. Been doing alright.
KC  5:14
Congratulations I didn't realize you were such a new owner.
JH 5:17
Yeah, yep.
KC  5:18
So tell us a little bit I know you did it kind of as we were walking around, but tell us a little bit
more about the history of Y and J. And...
JH 5:27
Yeah, so uh, the way it goes is Matt---
KC  5:31
--- Yarborough, and?
JH 5:33
It's, it's Yarborough and Johnson. So Yarborough and Johnson. The original Matt Yarborough got
this location and they had another upholstery shop that's actually right down the street, you'll see
Johnson's upholstery. It's not too far off the street, but it's over there right off [insterstate] 85, that
exit over there. And what was cool was they both came together and started doing the building of
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
furniture and upholstery and furniture. And then, as time went on, they were able to take out a
small loan, which I think it was like $20,000 at the time, but this was 1945 at the time. And then
I think that equivalent---- I was talking to Matt Yarborough a couple weeks ago because ABC 11
came by and they did a story on us too. So we were talking about it and I think that, that was like
going to be like $750,000 now. So he--- they both worked and bought that building, and then
started expanding some things. And I think they paid it off in a year, that loan. And they worked
like seven days a week. And so, they were doing that. And then after that, Mr. Yarborough and
Johnson, I think his--- Johnson had his son, something had to leave. And there was some--- and
join the military or something. And then Johnson had something come up so he left it. And then
so now it's just Yarborough's. But Johnson left, but they always kept the name Yarborough and
Johnson. So that's kind of like---- and then they just kept it going. And then senior--- then Matt
senior gave it over to his son, and then he gave it over to Matt. And then the other sorts of first,
the second, the third that took over.
KC  7:24
And now you're the fourth by another mother.
JH 7:26
Yeah, exactly. Exactly.
KC  7:29
And would you describe the sort of complex you have here?
JH 7:32
Yeah. So I think originally it used to be a road house back in the day from what I was told. It
was, I guess, truckers in that that time would come over here and, and chill. But when they
bought it, they started to expand it. And so the way it is you have your first building where all the
lumber would get--- come in. And that's why the building, it's kind of set up like that, because
that's how they would do all the cutting the sanding, the building the joinery, and it's more setup
for uh, building than it is to do repairs and things like that. So, so it kind of goes around. And
then we have the, the other warehouse in the back where I was telling you they shipped things all
over the country at one point in time. And they were shipping things to think to California and
they still have customers that would actually sometimes call us and say, Hey, are you guys still
around? And we're like, yeah, we are. And so we've talked about the Y and J, because we
stamped all the furniture back in the day when they did that.
KC  8:30
Do you still have one of those stamps?
JH 8:32
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Yeah, we do. Yeah, we do. Yeah, we do. We have that. Then, let me see. And then we have the---
this was a showroom. Like I was telling you, they didn't have Google so you had to come by.
And, and in that book, there's pictures of the place where they had all the pieces and you come
by, pick it out what you want, and then they build it for you and ship it to you, and go from there.
So. But it's on three acres and it's like 16,000 square foot total. And then the other shipping area
back there is---- that's kind of just kind of got storage and just kind of overcrowded with stuff.
But that's--- the only thing we go up there for is the air compressor. So but um...
JG  9:12
What was the signature Y and J furniture style when they started out, what were people looking
for?
JH 9:19
Basically.... let me see. It was basically like this, uh, Queen Anne style stuff, Chippendale style
stuff. It was mainly walnut, mahogany--- those mirrors over there [gestures]. Those are
Chippendale mirrors. Those were the kind of style that they were looking for, people were
looking for. China cabinets, big, big china cabinets were the big thing that they they did.
Sideboards and all kinds of stuff like that. So it mainly started out with that. But they did beds,
we still have--- they did beds, dining room tables, china cabinets, hutches, all kinds of stuff---
chairs, a lot of chairs yhey did. So there was a whole different, there was a whole different style,
but it was mainly the Chippendale kind of Queen Ann style stuff they were doing. And then there
was special pieces that people wanted built a certain way. And we would do that, well they
would do that.
KC  10:16
When did the transition from building new to repair start to happen?
JH 10:20
I think it was in about the 70s or so. 70s and 80s. They would, I guess, as time goes on, people
were going to other manufacturers and stuff like that. And Durh--- and think if they could have
maybe marketed a little bit better, maybe they would have been able to like compete with some
of these other ones, but we would have been a whole different company that, you know, then
what happened. But people would break one of their chairs or damage something, and so ah---
that they had us build. So then they started bringing it to them to "Hey, can you fix it?" Of
course, you know, and so that kind of turned into as the years change in the 80s, and the 90s. And
then some of these other companies came through the bigger ones that kind of took over and
dominated. Then they started, you know, just doing repairs. And now that's what we're known for
in this industry now. So.
KC  11:10
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Are you responsible for the ads on WUNC [radio station]?
JH 11:14
Yeah
KC  11:14
Nice work.
JH 11:16
Well, thank you. Yeah, we, yeah, we market on there occasionally. And, you know, when we,
when we feel like we want to when, like, you know, there's the election and stuff like that, we'll
do it, you know. Or politics when people are listening, though, but yeah, we'll do it occasionally.
I like it. So it's fun kind of getting the name back out there. Because a lot of people don't even---
I mean, they're, a lot of our clients can be in their 30s and 40s. But a lot of the people that come
through are 60, 70. And they maybe you know go online, but then they hear the ad they're like,
"Oh my God, Y and J's still here. Well, let me go and check them out!" You know, and so they'll
bring something to us or call us and didn't even know we were still here. Because Mr.
Yarborough back in the day, he didn't do any marketing. It was just word of mouth. And which,
that would be scary to me now, because I've put a lot of time and energy into marketing and kind
of growing the business and being known. Getting reviews and just kind of building it and
building it. So that's where we're at now with it. So.
KC  12:16
Well I'm really glad that you were, like, you knew Mr. Yarborough and could come in and take it
over as opposed to it just fading away.
JH 12:24
Yeah, exactly. That would have been a shame, I think. To do that, let it all the history and what
this place has been for so long. I mean, there's, there's crazy stories, and there's, you know, some
of the workers that have been here, you know, for so long. If you come back, James has been
here for 30 years or so. And so it's on and off, and he's now in his eighties. And so, Winnifred,
he's in his 80s. And it seems to me like there was always like, some of these guys would get fed
up, come back, get fed up, come back. And so that's how it is, though.
JG  13:01
Can't fully quit.
JH 13:02
Yeah, exactly. So.
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  13:04
Does it--- I mean, there's a lot of workers here, it does kind of feel like a family.
JH 13:09
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
JG  13:09
You know you're all working together you have to kind of know, cuz you have to, it looks like
pieces are being traded between shop tables and stuff. So there's a lot of collaboration.
JH 13:18
Oh, yeah, there's a, you know, there's no perfect like, technology to run this type of business.
Because you have your inventory, but it's not the same, every piece is completely different. This
chair's broken a different way. It's a different--- whole different chair. So you have your guys
that, like, you have your station where people can just strip it. And then you have your guys who
can just repair it. Then you have people---- because you want to get the repairs done. And then
you want to move on to the sanding, if it needs to be sanded. So you have sanders, and you've
got your guys who know how to make parts and stuff like that. And so, I know all their strengths
and weaknesses. And we all are, we are close. I mean, we'll definitely you know, many days go
out after work or lunch and go do stuff and you know, go eat and take everyone out to eat. So
we'll do that often. And if a guy has an issue or something, they always--- we always treat people
like family. So we always help each other out. You know, and I think it's that's what makes it so
unique. Because I've worked at other places and there's not family and I've worked at small
businesses, it doesn't feel family, but this place does. I mean, when somebody's not here, you feel
it. Everyone, you know, gets worried about some of the you know, guys if they don't show up
like Winnifred or James you know they're in their 80s. So, but everyone's always checking on
each other and making sure everyone's good stuff like that. So it is family-oriented.
JG  14:41
Has there ever been a repair that's come in that among all the--- even all the specialists here it's
been a head scratcher that you haven't been able to figure out what to do?
JH 14:51
It's really---- no. It's just whether we want to do it or not. But you know---  Ben, he sells  the jobs
and as he goes out, does the project managing, and then I kind of like make sure the production
is running with Lowell. But there's jobs that come in that it's just like, it's really beat up and bad.
And then it's just like, okay, we can start on that, but let's just do this other job because it's, you
know, faster or better and more fun than--- because we've had executive desks come in that have
been, like, trashed, and they want to get them replaced or repaired, so we do it. But yeah, it's
really, there really hasn't been many. There is some repairs on chairs and things like that, where,
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
you know, you just, you can't repair it. You just got to make the part. So there's always kind of
that, you know. But it's just whether we want to do it or not, sometimes, if it's a, if it's just gonna
be a hard, boring project, you know. So, that's it.
JG  15:49
Are there any particularly memorable pieces that were really exciting to work on? Because they
were unusual or had significance? Historically, or....?
JH 16:00
Yeah, there's a couple of ones. We did some stuff for a museum, we did some other ones for---
you know, we had to use the exact same tools that they use back in the 1700s for the museum. So
yeah, there's quite a bit of stuff that you'll get sometimes. There's tables too, that we've gotten
from--- there's one that we got from like, the 15th century that we had to do some repairs on,
which was really cool. So you think 500 year old?
KC  16:28
That's not even from the U.S. right?
JH 16:29
Yeah, actually, I don't---
KC  16:30
It's from Europe or something.
JH 16:30
I don't yeah, there, you don't even know where some of this stuff comes from. We've worked on
Thomas Day stuff, too. I don't know if you're familiar with Thomas Day, but he was a slave who
started doing furniture building and stuff like that up in Oxford [NC].
KC  16:43
Did he do the, like, staircases?
JH 16:47
No, he did just mainly furniture, but he was a carpenter too, I think at one point. So he might
have done those too, but his pieces are like, worth a lot of money now. So but he was a slave that
turned into a woodworker. And was--- his stuff was really cool. So we worked on his stuff. And
that's kind of like--- and it's cool too you see, you don't know what you're gonna get. But you get
like a chest of drawers and, and you'll see it signed by like all the guys who've worked on it over
the, like 100 years. And then you're putting your name there that you worked on it. And you're
with these other guys, and you see the repairs they did and all that stuff. And it's really cool. So
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
that's kind of neat. We always look for signatures and stuff, who worked on it, and then you, you
know, feel like okay, cool. Then you--- that's what we do, too we sign our name, not Y and J, but
sometimes we'll sign our name with the rest of the guys. And that's what you do in the industry.
And kind of go from there. So it's cool, you know. So those are the pieces that kind of stand out.
It's just a myriad of different ones and things like that, you know? So [crosstalk] no no I mean,
the one that could be memorable was just a settee we were doing. And we told the client, of
course, but we opened it up, we're gonna refinish it, and someone had stuffed their savings in
there. And I don't know how much it was, but it was probably close to like sixty, seventy
thousand dollars.
KC  18:04
Really?
JG  18:04
What!
JH 18:04
Yeah, so they stuffed it in there. So we told them of course.
JG  18:07
They had no idea?
JH 18:08
No.
KC  18:08
Did you look at the dates on the bills? Like when it was from?
JH 18:11
No, no, no, I just found it and you're kind of like, Oh, man. I mean, sometimes you find like $1
or $50 in some of these, like cabinets and stuff like that. But um yeah to find that much it was
just like, wow, okay.
JG  18:22
That's like right out of a movie.
JH 18:24
So yeah.
JG  18:25
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Oh I bought this at this thrift store and it's stuffed with cash.
JH 18:27
Well, that's what they did. They said they bought it years ago at some consignment store. And
then we went to strip it. And there was--- cause sometimes I've seen some weird stuff people
have put in their furniture, and they've changed it up and stuff. And it's just crazy. But that was
kind of memorable. So, to find that. Yeah.
KC  18:50
Talk to us a little bit about the industry. You said you're 40 and you're coming and taking over a
shop and putting in a lot of marketing, like just speak, speak to us about sort of the state of the
industry right now and what you've witnessed.
JH 19:06
So what I know about it is in Europe, they had this one road called Brown Street where it was all
these furniture makers, repairers. And that used to have like hundreds of shops. And now that's
down to like, I think there's only like 10 or something now in Europe. And then, what I've
noticed about this industry is it's always going to be like the--- you get there's a sweet spot, you
get too big, it gets too chaotic. And then you get too small, you, you know, you don't have
enough workers to get the work done. But the industry is what I've seen is--- it's so hard to
gauge. I've talked to people about it. I've talked to other business owners who do this. And
they're--- like I said, the process is just so unique. It's like, you want to stay kind of small, and
because everything is so overwhelming and repairs are so different. So, as far as the industry is
going, I really don't know. I never would have thought that during the pandemic that people
would be calling so much. But they're sitting on an uncomfortable couch, so they just want to get
it reupholstered or something. So, but I've looked into the--- you know, thinking, trying to gauge
how this works, and you know... but there's really, you have like Furniture Medic, who just
comes by and does repairs, like on scratches or something like that. But shops like us who do
what we do, you don't really see another location that they have, it's just like, one location, a few
guys. And that's really all it is, you know, and that's the way it's been for a while. And so, but I
think, you know, what I would like to do, I think I would like to maybe open up another location
somewhere in North Carolina. I'm thinking like, maybe Charlotte or Winston-Salem, and be kind
of one of the first ones that do that. You know, kind of have a another location and do the work.
Because once you get the, you know, the people in place, you get the process and all that, you
know, you have to get this model working, and then you can maybe do that, too. So eventually,
that's kind of like one of my goals. But most of the people in the industry are just---- they can be
rough. They don't really communicate well. They don't, you know, have a degree in, you know,
psychology and so they, they can be kind of rough. And sometimes you call them the toothless
guys, because it's just, you know, one guy working in a shop doing some of this over here. And
there's some other people, and--- but I don't really, I mean, as far as where it's going and where
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
it's headed, you would think that I would want to know all that stuff. But it's so hard to gauge. I
mean, I just--- people like doing this, let's, you know, we'll fix their furniture. I think we'll always
have it. But in my feeling, I feel like we, this will always be. It's, you know, mechanics have it
easier, they can go and order the part. And it's already there, we have to make the part. I'm sure
maybe one day, Elon Musk or something will come up with a robot that can do this. But as for
now, I think it's hands on and takes time. And you know, doing that, though, so. But yeah, I
really don't know where it's gonna go and how it's gonna go, honestly. I think it's a great industry,
but it's, it's--- everyone I've talked to it's, it's like 50% problems. I mean, it really is, especially
being a small business. You know, there's really, you're not looked after. I mean, the taxes you
have to pay and all the other stuff. Sometimes you kind of wonder Good Lord, like, what's the
point sometimes. And, but you know, you have jobs and you have people that come in every day,
and you have clients that are thrilled to see everything, you know, turn around and transform, so.
But I'm can't tell you where it's gonna go how it's going to be honestly. So...
JG  22:52
Well presumably people will always have furniture.
JH 22:55
Yeah.
JG  22:55
...around.
JH 22:55
Yeah.
JG  22:55
So that bodes well for your industry.
JH 22:58
Yeah.
JG  22:58
Could you speak a little bit to the change in business during the pandemic?
JH 23:03
Yeah, um, it was interesting. It went from being like, just moderately, like coming in with work.
And then all of a sudden, the pandemic hit and then everyone was just calling us and emailing us,
and just, just coming in left and right. And so it got really busy, big jobs were coming in. Which
was interesting, because I didn't--- you know, it's the first time this has happened, you know, in a
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
long time here, in America. So, it was interesting that people were like, yeah, we'll come on by,
but do this. And, you know, pick up furniture and come into their house, and they were still
dropping things off. And so, but it picked up dramatically. I mean, it was kind of interesting to
see that it was so much that we didn't even have to do the the PPP [Paycheck Protection
Program] loan, because.... I would have loved to do that. But at that time, you know, we weren't
really affected. And I felt like other people should have gotten that. So they did. But, but yeah, it
was--- it picked up just out of the blue. And....
KC  24:00
You said you hired people?
JH 24:02
Yeah, yeah, hired a couple, a lot of people actually. We had about one, two, about four people
now during it. So, but you're grateful that you have a job and that the work's here and that you're
able to like, you know, do the stuff. Stay busy and feed your family and do that stuff. So you
know, when other people are struggling so hard? It's, yeah, that sucks. But you know, it's nice
that we are busy. That's good. So we're grateful for the clients and all that though. It's, it's nice.
Having lifetime clients that you know, spend tens of thousands of dollars with us. Or they have
just one chair repaired and we'll never see him again. It's everyone you know, will talk about us
and tell their family and friends and so you stay busy by that word of mouth as well.
KC  24:52
Yeah, I heard about y'all through word of mouth.
JH 24:56
Yeah
KC  24:57
Just telling people we were doing this project. They're like, Oh, you gotta check out Y and J.
JH 25:01
Yeah. That's cool. That's cool.
KC  25:04
So you said you have a couple of women who work on repairs?
JH 25:08
Yeah.
KC  25:09
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
How unusual is that? In your view.
JH 25:12
I think it's just a male dominant, you know, industry. But we have Maria and Alison. And it's,
you don't really see much of that in any shop really.
KC  25:24
What are their specialties?
JH 25:26
They do--- Maria will do the sanding. And she's learning more--- she worked in a manufacturing
plant. So she would do the big pieces of wood and sand it now. But now this is different because
you have veneers. And this is wood that has to be sanded a little bit different, not so harshly. So
she'll do that. And she's learning repairs and some of that stuff. And then Alison is--- she works
on the pieces that need to be sanded. And then she works on some of the pieces that helps with
the finishing where they have to do the stain and the other stuff that has to be done with it. And
getting it ready, the prepping and stuff like that for finishing. Because there's so many different
steps with finishing. You have to spray sealer, scuff it---- don't scuff it too hard---apply the stain.
Spray it again. Scuff it again. Spray it again. Scuff it again. Do all this tedious stuff. So, you have
six chairs or a table you got to do, go with the grain. And so women are tedious about that. So
they're--- and I think what I've always liked is that women can talk and work at the same time.
Guys stop when they talk. And they--- so you, so you get that with them. But there's a lot of little
tedious things that they can do that guys who--- will overlook you know. They have that
woman's eye or touch or you know, so.
KC  26:40
Are they learning from some of the men who have been in the shop for a lot longer?
JH 26:44
Oh, yeah everyone teaches
KC  26:45
That's cool.
JH 26:46
Her, ah....
KC  26:46
You've got apprenticeships happening.
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JH 26:48
Yeah. Well, Alison is married to one of our woodworkers, Brandon. And so they're a duo here.
And yeah. So and then Maria--- she's worked to have the background of all that other stuff, but
she's learning from everybody. I mean, yeah, you gotta pick up the knowledge. That's what I tell
the guys here because when the older guys go, you know, we've got to take that knowledge in.
Because I meet a lot of people like Thomas England, you should maybe should, if want to talk to
him, he does clock repairs. He does that stuff. He's not--- I dunno he's kind of rough. But...
KC  27:22
You know what? Repair people. [laughs]
JH 27:26
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. That's true. But a....
KC  27:30
Y'all are similar in some ways.
JH 27:32
Yeah, exactly. But um, yeah, check out Thomas England, he'll tell you about that. Or Steve
brown in Raleigh. He does Brown's clock shop.
KC  27:40
Oh cool.
JH 27:41
He does that stuff. And then he'll tell you, you know---- you, you have these guys, either you
want to train people, or they want to learn what they can and start their own business. And then
they don't--- you know, so a lot of these guys kind of got sour to teaching people because it
would be like, I'm gonna pass this on to you, then they try to start their business, they'd fail.  And
it's like, you know, there's a whole--- you know, a lot more to it, obviously. But, um, I met, I
talked to Thomas and Steve Brown, and there's no one learning how to repair clocks. And, you
know, do all that intricate stuff that they do. I mean, which is really fascinating, too. I like that a
lot. But you know, so there's not people doing that. And also, some of the stuff that these guys
know how to do--- the repairs. You know, you can learn from some of the new people, but there's
other ways that have been repaired for years.  Patching and veneer and "how do you do this?
When, what period do you do it on?" And what you know, don't you do? But you learned that
from those guys, you know. Because you look up how to fix something, it's not gonna show you
exactly what you need. I mean, we have the old books, you know, and things like that. But, you
know, yeah you got to learn from all those guys who know this stuff, because, you know, yeah,
they're, they're masters at what they do. And it's overlooked too. I mean and these all these
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
people are artists, you know. There's artists, I actually call in sometimes a girl named Cassie,
because she has to hand paint some of the stuff on these things. And she just can do that. She's an
artist, so she can restore it and does that. So, but you got to learn from all these people, though.
KC  29:18
When you said you have to use tools from the 1700s, how did that work? Did you--- like you
said you had a guy who can make tools or...?
JH 29:26
Yeah, so there's different---- so back then, when you wanted to cut a piece of wood, you know,
obviously you had your saw and cut it. So, then you've got to, you know, you can't just even cut a
piece of wood on a DeWalt saw. You've got to use that piece of wood. Find an old piece of wood
that goes into that, that fixes that. And so that's what you would have to do. So, and then when
you wanted to sand it, back then they would plane in it and pull it, and you know, and draw it
towards them and plane it that way. That's some of the things you have to do. You know, to kind
of keep it preserved. All the history and the value of it, and things like that.
KC  30:05
The quality of, like, the hand planing...
JH 30:07
Yeah.
KC  30:07
...is different than....
JH 30:08
Yeah, if you look under that table right there behind you [gestures]. Yeah, right there. There's,
you can see some of the saw marks. You can see the saw marks, you can feel them, and you'll
say, oh, my goodness they did--- you can see how they cut it. And then you can see where they
shaped it. And they kind of did like all those motions with it. And, yeah.
JG  30:27
Where do you source the rare old woods to match?
JH 30:34
It's hard. It's, it's really hard, they don't let the trees grow like they used to. So if you've got an
old old piece, and you need to get something like some nice walnut or something, a certain kind,
you---- there's people that have it, you call them but it's all getting eaten up, people are using it.
And, um--- but the trees now they don't let them grow at all. So they use them so quick for two
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
by fours and stuff like that for--- you know. But it's getting more expensive to, to buy the wood
that you need for some of these projects. Mahogany, the walnut, and things like that. So there's
various places all around. And you can find the best wood by going up the street and finding the
tree you like and it might be cut down and sitting there on someone's yard. And you ask them if
you can cut it. That's actually how you can buy from them that way. Yeah, and then there's guys
who have wood that they just mill and it's there and ready to go. And so you can buy from them.
But then there's places out in Burlington that have stuff like that you can do and by the wood.
But usually it's word of mouth, "Hey, I got this tree that fell," we'll mill it, cut it down. And
that's--- you can get your wood that way, too.
KC  31:46
Did you feel like you ended up pretty close to your original aspirations of just working with
trees?
JH 31:52
Yeah, yeah. Because even when it's wood, when it's on the table, and it's here, it's always alive.
It's expanding and contracting, it's always moving. And that's why you have like pieces like that
[gestures to table]. And you have the gaps. On like, that piece I was telling you, that's mine, you
have the gaps, and you have the curves of all this stuff that warps. And you have things like that
that happened. So yeah it's, yeah.
JG  32:17
Especially in this nice North Carolina humidity.
JH 32:19
Yeah. So, you know, yeah, there's, there's all kinds of stuff like that's always moving. And you
kind of appreciate that too. And it's always expanding and contracting in a certain way. And it's
cool, you know. And the one thing too, when you do like a repair, we don't like screws, we like
to use dowels. And then you have to even turn your dowel a certain way. So that when the wood
is expanding, and contracting this way, the dowel will do it the same way. So it doesn't, you
know, get loose on you and come out.  You know, so you have to think of that stuff and little
things like that you learn as you go, you know.
KC  32:52
So tell, tell us a little bit about, like, sentimentality, like, how does that play into it when people
come in with a piece that maybe isn't of any historical value. But have you witnessed any stories
where you're just like, this is not worth it but you see that it's not just about the piece, but it's also
about the memory and the value people put on?
JH 33:22
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Oh, yeah, that's a lot of that stuff. I mean, we just had a guy bring in a table that he punched and
dented it so we're gonna repair it. It's not worth, you know, in my opinion, but it's just a, you
know, a newer table. So we'll do that. And then there's people that come in that are just---- you
know, very sensitive about some of the stuff that they get. It's very sentimental and it's stuff
they've had for their grandparents and stuff. We've done, we just did a job in Virginia, we
delivered it back and they had pieces that were awesome empire pieces in some other period
pieces. And they've had it in their family for like, you know, generations and now he's got it. And
he's in his 80s and he's gonna hopefully pass it down but at this point, he says he doesn't know
because you know, the kids, you know, 30s and 40s are getting mobile, the apartments are
smaller. People are more mobile now and kind of moving around. And so in, like even that One
City Center that building down the street, they---- people have great furniture in there. We have a
lot of clients, but you can't have anything like this piece [gestures to a large china cabinet] in
there. It's just all windows and so you can't, you know, there's really no room for something like
that. So, but a lot of sentimental stuff that comes into it. You know, I've always, always
appreciated that, you know. They've had it for, sometimes hundreds of years and are they have a
memory where someone had died. There was a chair that--- a rocking chair that the lady's mother
was blind and she would always run her finger in the same way and she put a groove in there. We
had to restore the chair because it broke, but she said don't take that out. We've had clients where
their kids have scarred the table wrote something on there. And the kid passed away, we had to
restore the table. It's very sad. It's that was where they sat and things like that. If you move that
binder, and look at the scarring on that table, that was where they would--- her grandmother
would cut the meat and, and do that. So you know, it's just there's little things like that, that
people will bring up and "do not touch this" or you know, things like that.
JG  35:30
So you get a lot of stories when something's brought in?
JH 35:31
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we do. And they've got, yeah, we've got funny ones to where the kid got
mad at the parents and he carved a curse word in there. And you know, and they love that table.
But can you fix this? You know, I love this table. So yeah. So you know, we do that too, as well.
And, then, but yeah, a lot of sentimental stuff comes in. I mean, of course, I mean, in this day and
age, I hope people realize that this furniture that you have is much better than the IKEA, Rooms
to Go landfill stuff that's going to break. I mean, people--- I don't even work on those sofas, they
come in. And nah, there's no--- it's not real wood. It's staples, a couple glue, and it's pressboard.
It's not even real, it's just particleboard. It's just not, you can't work with it. You can't drill a hole
and put anything in it. So. So I hope people would buy like, better quality stuff, go to a
consignment store. And that's why I was happy when AOC [congressworman Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez] about two years ago said stop buying, you know this stuff from IKEA. Go to a
consignment store and get it, and get it fixed up. And I thought that was you know--- it's
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
awesome that's what you should do you know? Because some of this stuff has good bones, it's
good stuff that lasts a long time. But you don't have to get the bigger pieces, you get some of the
smaller chest and like, you know, side tables and things like that. But yes, so the sentimental
thing is really a big deal, though. A lot, a lot of people have had furniture forever, and their
family, and and then some people, you know, don't know what to do with it don't know what they
have. And it's just as soon throw it away and just have minimalists and just have whatever they
want, you know, some small IKEA stuff or whatever. So.
JG  35:55
I was just thinking at some point, I feel like I'm gonna drown in family furniture. Like I inherited
so much. And I'm....
JH 37:15
Yeah
JG  37:16
....just eyeing how much more is coming my way. So I find it a little terrifying. But it's like, I
need these pieces that fill that gap until it kind of...
KC  37:27
I only have one dresser.
JG  37:28
Really?
KC  37:28
Yeah.
JG  37:29
I have so much. You can have some of mine.
JH 37:32
Yeah, a lot of people, yeah yeah they're going through that. I think, yeah, there's hopefully they
hold on to it, or they do something good with it. Or, you know, don't just throw it away or
something. But you know. But yeah, I, I was in that predicament too even when my mom passed
away, she had pieces. And I've had what I have, and then you get... But they were in poor
condition, but they were great. And, you know, so you've got to decide what you're going to do
with it. If it's worth repairing or---- and that's why we actually follow the trends. We you know,
some of the younger people in their early 30s get inherited furniture. I really like this table, but
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
let's paint it. Let's you know, so then we'll paint it. And we follow those trends. That's what we
got to do.
JG  38:13
Right, because furniture trends change. And it's--- there's not a lot of people in my generation
that are interested in owning a china cabinet, for example.
JH 38:21
Yeah. Me neither. Yeah.
JG  38:23
And it's like, it's cool that you have the, you know, flexibility to kind of help people update
things...
JH 38:29
Yeah
JG  38:29
....to make them work for their lifestyle.
JH 38:31
Yeah, I think what's really cool is the, you know, instead of a china cabinet, get like one of those
little stackable barrister bookcases like the lawyers have with the little door opens up and they
stack. I don't know if you know what I'm talking about. But those, those are smaller, and you
don't--- you can put all kinds of knickknacks and things in there. You don't have to have a
china---- I mean, why do we need that many dishes? I mean, honestly, me and my wife, we have
three kids. So we buy paper plates, like you know. I'm not gonna--- I don't need dishes, and
showin' them off. Like, I live in every inch of my house. You know, I don't--- I use every inch of
everything in there. So at this day and age. So I don't, you know, we don't have plates to show off
or anything like that. You don't really need that anymore. But the older people do, and they're
used to that, but I think us we're all like "nah."
KC  39:16
What do you find most satisfying about this job?
JH 39:20
You know, you're not going to get crazy rich. You do okay, but you're not going to get wealthy,
wealthy. I think what's really satisfying and what I like is the camaraderie with all the guys that
work here the variety of different people. I really like that a lot. I mean, it's fun. I mean, I'll keep
it going as long as I can for the sake of, like, having another family that you know---- my kids
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
come here and my wife comes here sometimes. We eat lunch sometimes their friends come here.
That's all like it's---- I like the satisfying thing of having a business, and I've always loved taking
care of people. So it's been nice to be able to, like, take care of people who have [inaudible] and
provide jobs. And, you know, we all work together. And you know, we can all have a huge
argument, some of us and then at the end of the day, go have beers and it's gone. You know, it's
over, you know. And so I like that. I like the satisfaction of this, and seeing the furniture kind of
changed from being like something like, this little break to being this is like now it's this matte---
like, wonderful thing that has shellack on it looks really cool, it pops. And you take it to the
person and they look at it, and they're blown away. And so that's really cool. So there's little
aspects about it. But yeah, I mean, other than that, I mean, running a business is fun. I love it.
But, you know, I don't like the taxes and all that stuff that they take away from you. So, but
KC  40:55
Who does?
JH 40:56
Man, I'll tell you what, I had no idea until I started getting into this. And so, but yeah. So that's
why there's like that sweet spot you got to keep it at. I think if you get too big, you know--- it's
just there's just too much that goes on. Every piece is so different. Everybody's so unique. It's a
blue collar industry. The one thing that's weird, like a lot of the guys---- when Matt Yarborough
was telling me the other guys, he would bail out a few guys every month from jail because they
were in--- some guys would, you know, I can talk about it now because it was decades ago, but
they were they needed to have their drink in the morning before they came to work, and do what
they had to do. And so, you know, and we still run into some issues now with some of the guys
because it's blue collar and you know.
KC  41:44
And independent, you own your skill set.
JH 41:47
Yeah, yeah. So, but yeah, I've never had to bail anyone out jail yet. Yet
KC  41:51
[laughs] Since March.
JG  41:53
But would you go there?
JH 41:56
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Oh, yeah, I yeah--- I had a, I had a guy turn up missing for two days, but came back and he just
needed to take, get going. Some people just need a little road and do what they gotta do.
JG  42:06
A walkabout.
JH 42:07
Yeah, you know? And so---- I came back, I saw him. I put my arm around him. I said, You good?
He goes, Yeah, I'm fine. I just needed to.... I say you just need a little road, go out there and do
your thing. And I get it, come back, and you know. You know, is that the right kind of boss? I
don't know. But like, that's how I approach things and let everyone know that we're here that
way. And, you know, for each other. So, there was a guy who had a car broke down and his wife,
her car wasn't working. And so yeah, I paid for that, you know, to help them out. And, you know,
we all need a little hand and things like that. But um, yeah, so I think there's so many different
things I love about it. But it's hard to say. And there's a lot of negative things. And, you know,
deadlines. The one thing about this, though, you're always looking weeks and weeks in advance.
I've got jobs that are due in March, and I've got jobs that are due in April, and I've got a guy
who's bringing church doors, and he's bringing like 12 church doors, and he needs them done this
time. So what's bad about it is you always are looking ahead, you know. You're never living in
the moment. You're just always like, okay, Friday--- we got to get this done by Friday. So let's
you know, you always are looking ahead. Never living in the moment, never just appreciating
this. And then you go home and you have kids, and it's always the same thing. You're watching
them grow up. And it's always planning ahead and ahead. It's never like just appreciating this.
And so, that's one thing that I would like to work on personally, you know. Because everyone
wants their furniture at a certain time. And you can't keep people waiting too long. And then
there's things that were just out of our control that happens. And it pushes back so then you're
always looking ahead. And so "well this job, we got to move this job down a little bit" and this
and this. And so, that gets frustrating. Yeah.
KC  43:51
You got the--- you're dealing with the past with all this old furniture....
JH 43:55
Yeah.
KC  43:55
... and thinking about the future.
JH 43:57
That's exactly right. That's exactly right.
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  44:01
We always ask the folks we've talked to if they have a favorite tool.
JH 44:07
Mine? My favorite tool. It's---- mine it's not like a hand tool, but the lathe. That's mine. I love the
lathe. I love turning things, and doing that. I think when it comes to repairs, I don't like some of
the tedious little stuff you got to do. But that lathe spins so fast. It's one of the most dangerous
tools in any shop. And then you can see your work--- one mistake and you can see everything
just go.... aww that was too much. And you got to get your caliper, and make sure it's right and
you gotta--- it goes fast. So I that's why I like doing the lathe. That's my favorite one working on
that. I love that. When I have time I play with that all the time, and make stuff and do parts for
chairs and spindles that we had to do. So, I like that because it's it seems like it's a slow process
but it's spinning so fast, and you're just--- got this sharp blade in your hand and you just got to
make sure you, you know are handling it right. And the wood's flying off and then you're doing
your thing. So that's my favorite tool. That's what I like. Yeah.
KC  45:12
Do you have any more questions?
JH 45:14
Do you want me to see if Winnifred's in? And he's ah--- maybe come talk to him for a little bit?
KC  45:20
Sure!
JH 45:20
Okay, let me go next door.
JG  45:22
Thank you so much for your time.
JH 45:22
Yeah yeah yeah!
KC  45:23
We realize you're working and the boss so....
JH 45:25
Yeah yeah yeah.
afc2020009_012--Jared Huffman  interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  45:25
.... we appreciate it
JH 45:26
That was not too bad though.
KC  45:28
Nothing you didn't know the answer to?
JH 45:30
[laughs] Yeah let me see if he's here and if not I can maybe get Lowell for a little bit. No, he's---
most of the guys are just like, ahh, I don't want to do an interview.
KC  45:39
I know, believe--- we know some people don't come [tape cuts off]
