DAMON WALKER, Luthier 
 
Julia Gartrell  0:24   
November 25, 2020. 
 
Katy Clune  0:29   
And it's Katy Clune sitting here with Julia Gartrell. And Damon, if you could introduce your 
phone name for the tape and just kick us off by telling us what you do.  
 
Damon Walker  0:42   
Okay. I'm Damon [Stacey] Walker, full name. I happen to be a luthier. I own a stringed 
instrument shop here in Durham, North Carolina. I'm from New York, but I've been operating in 
this area for probably about 15 years. This physical location presently, for the last almost seven 
years. I restore, and rent, and sell basically anything with strings on it, but bass is my specialty. 
 
KC  1:07   
And what's the title of your business? 
 
DW  1:10   
Oh, the name of the business is Dr. Bass String Instruments, Repair, Rental and Sales. And my 
title is technically luthier. 
 
KC  1:19   
So we're doing this project, really, because we're just curious about repair professionals across 
fields in North Carolina. So our questions will be pretty general. And I'll ask more kind of about 
your biography. And Julia might get in a little bit more about the materials and process.  
 
DW  1:37   
Okay,  
 
KC  1:38   
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

But maybe just start by telling us how you came into this career? 
 
DW  1:45   
[Laughs] So that's a story at least we talked about [referencing pre-interview conversation with 
JG]. But it's basically a movie. It really is that simple. It's that I was a little bit lacking direction. 
And I was going a lot of different directions at the same time. I love art, I love form, I love 
design. So for those reasons, put together with some others—including my appreciation for 
structure—I was architecture student.  
 
DW  1:48   
But at the same time, I was also in my job building furniture. I knew I had a passion for wood, 
just the smell of it, for working with wood and everything, I had a knack. I can even pick out the 
very dead center of a piece of wood, a plank of wood or anything like that, and almost always be 
like, correct to the millimeter. Anyway, I just had an appreciation for the craft of building.  
 
DW  2:32   
And third to those, I am a musician. I was a bass guitarist at that point, aspiring to the upright. I 
loved uprights—to see them, to hear them—but I hadn't even touched one by this point. I just 
was looking for that bottom sound and that big acoustic sound. Where as the bass guitar, if you 
played in a room without an amp, it is just "boing boing" [imitates unplugged electric guitar] and 
that's all I had for the first five years of playing. I got an amp way later down the road. And it's 
about that point that I saw this movie City Slickers with Billy Crystal. And I'm just that kind of 
person. I'm always looking for messages and signs in anything, in this case, a comedy [laughs]. 
And somebody is trying to advise Billy, basically—Curly the cowboy—out the desert. And he's 
telling him, "You know, you're making everything so much more complicated than it has to be. 
Just pick one thing and everything else will fall into place."I thought about that. And my first 
thought, is that okay, I am driving myself nuts. I'm barely sleeping. I'm doing too much. (I 
should mention that I was in four bands at that time.) So architecture, and furniture building, four 
bands, and all the rehearsals involved in them, in New York City—in New York City. [crosstalk, 
KC and JG] Exactly.

KC  3:42   
How old are you at this point? 
 
DW  3:44   
Holy crap. I was—I guess it was the early 90s. So I guess it started at about 19. And so I'll 
continue this journey. I guess this movie probably took place when I was about between 19 and 
20. I'd have to say, yeah. And it's hard to pin down, I've moved so much. But it's around that time 
that [I was] all over the place like this. So my first thought was that I need to sort of pick just one 
of these passions—because they were equal passions. And I'm going to do so well with this 
because it's a real passion, that I'll create the time and income resources for the other ones. But 
by about a couple of weeks into this thinking about it talking about to my best friend, it occurred 
to me, "No, I think it means I'm supposed to pick one thing that has pieces of all of these in 
common." So you got your design stuff, the wood craftsmanship, the musicianship, trying to get 
up to upright—"Hey, maybe I can design and build these guys." 
 
DW  4:38   
I never even heard of lutherie, it just, I came to those, that order of things and searched for a 
shop. And it's at that point that I found David Gage in Manhattan [of Finlay + Gage Musical 
Instruments NYC ]. He is world famous, and I got to go down and convince him to give me an 
apprenticeship. Part of it is sheer luck. He wasn't exactly looking to hire anybody. But my last 
name happened to be the name of the street that he's on—Walker Street [laughs]. And he liked 
my personality, I was affable, etc, approachable. He liked the fact that he wouldn't have to start 
from scratch with teaching me, because of what I'd already been doing with furniture making, we 
use some of the same tools and understandings. So for those reasons, and some others, I think, 
also to have a 'darker presence' in a shop that serves the whole music community, including a lot 
of jazz musicians, but no such presence in the shop, I represented an easy way to get to that 
point, with my little bit of background. And so it became clear within the first couple of months 
to them and me that this was my passion. This is where I need to be. I've been doing it ever 
since. [laughs]  
 
KC  5:47   
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
4 
How cool. 
 
DW  5:49   
Yeah, it's all luck. [laughs] 
 
JG  5:51   
It's amazing. I always like to know, what were the first tasks that he trusted you with? Where did 
he get you. . . Were you sweeping the floors? Or were you restringing things? Or . . .? 
 
DW  6:04   
That's a really good question. [crosstalk] Wow, I don't—nobody has asked me that before. I 
could tell you I did three apprenticeships, ultimately, his was the longest, the very last one I'm 
the most proudest, I'm the most proud of, because they—It was a violin cello maker called 
Viseltear & Young. In their case, nobody knew what the criteria was going to be. We were just 
given a task like, "Okay, well, you got to be working on this instrument. But we'll need you to 
take this first and make your knife and so forth." And we made knives and I was elected—
Ultimately, I'd never made a knife before, but they gave us some instruction. And they like how 
much attention I put into it, how I thought about it ergonomically, how I tested the wood in my 
hand, and the shape of what it means to carve a bridge and so forth. And then to find a balance 
point and flatten it so that I can stand my knives up on the desk. That'll got me in the door.  
 
DW  6:57   
In David Gages's case, I really don't—I think I started with gluing first. In fact, yes, that's it, I 
started first with gluing. And it's basically, there are several different types of glue—stop me if I 
get too much detail, I could go off, especially the more nervous I get—But so there are several 
types of glues all involved with these instruments. Basically, the differentiating factor is what do 
we intend to have reopened again, and what do we never want to open again. So things like the 
very front of it and the fingerboard this long flat surface upfront, things like that, we expect to 
have to reopen at some point, to have some other luthier open to work on the instrument. For that 
reason, we use a hide glue, which you can control the strength of. It's just made from animals—
unfortunately, the poor guys [laughs]—there's some from rabbits and from horse, you know. In 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
5 
the David Gage shop we called it "sopa de caballo"—horse soup. And I love the smell of it. I've 
never tasted it. [crosstalk and laughing] 
 
DW  8:11   
But you get to the point where you recognize the smell when it's fresh. And you know, I learned 
a couple things from David, including that recognizing right away with the smell of things. And 
also the sounds of things when they're right. Like he'll yell at me from the room next door. If I 
didn't take the time to sharpen my blade properly in a plane. He had this rusky voice: "Damon, 
sharpen that plane." [imitating David] And I'm like, "God dang it, I was trying to get away with 
it," because I want to hurry to get to repair and stuff. But now going to take a couple of hours to 
stop and take it apart, sharpen it, put it back together. And it's got this very identifiable sound 
when your planing something with a good sharp plane and then you like put soap or something 
ivory at the bottom of the box that the plane goes in. And it's like a [makes a quick, strong, 
brushing noise] kind of a sound, it was just—sighs.  
 
DW  8:55   
Anyway, I was talking about glue. Hide glue, which is the lightest you can control it down to just 
a really light kind of contact. It's, what it takes to open it back up is heat and water. So all it takes 
is your instrument to be in a room thats little too warm and things start popping back open. For 
that reason, seasonally, almost all the instruments come back at some point with things starting 
to open up around the edges. And some people freak out, like, "Why is it doing this?" No, that's 
natural, it's gonna happen. It's because the kind of glue we use, etc. So I started on that kind of 
thing. Understanding what needs to be glued, what way in what strengths and so forth, how to 
line things up and clamp them so you don't damage the instrument while you're clamping it 
together. And it built up slowly from there to some of the serious joints like the neck joint there. 
Oh, I'm sorry, about to get up to show you but basically the neck of the bass the fingerboard has 
on it kind of sticking past where that sets into the body. [Damon gets up and holds an upright 
bass, pointing to the parts he is referring to.] Where this all sets into the body. This is the 
mortice, it's just kind of a square space that the neck slides into. So you're gluing against the 
bottom surface and the side surfaces. So I guess I built my way up from there to—from just the 
edges, to then working with regluing necks into that mortice shape. And I think from there, he 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
6 
started trusting me with fittings, like carving the bridge, carving the nut where the strings go over 
into the top of the base. These [gesturing to bridge]—they look simple. Everybody thinks, "Oh, 
you just buy a bridge, and it has the feet shaped like, you know, the right arch that you just set it 
down in the belly. That's not true.  
 
DW  10:35   
All of these—no one bridge can stand on another base, you'll see it sticking up in places, you'll 
see little gaps and things. They are all custom fit to the belly of that specific instrument. And it's 
not just that simple, because you could end up with the feet fit perfectly, but the bridge leaning 
back, or leaning forward, or leaning left or leaning right. So it's like landing a plane as you're 
carving because you try to come down evenly, but make adjust for the right tilt. And sometimes 
you want to tilt on purpose. Like, if I have a neck, that was put in a mortice—I should stay with 
the mic—Okay, with a slight angle, sometimes this mortice shape is slightly like this, you know, 
or sometimes the mortice is fine, but the fingerboard was put on just such an angle, it's a lot more 
work to take to take that apart and correct it than it is to just make your bridge and compensate 
for that. That is, making one leg slightly shorter, so that the bridge leans to where the fingerboard 
is. So it's things like that, that I went to next after gluing 
 
JG  11:39   
With the bridge, is it all by eye? Or is there some way to measure that it's—? 
 
KC  11:45   
Yeah, do you cast the angle somehow? 
 
DW  11:49   
No. So there's a lot of different approaches. And the worst shops—oh God, it drives me nuts-they 
put sandpaper on the belly, they rub the bridge back and forth, to stand the bridge down to that 
shape. And you can always tell that because it's not a fine tight connection, there’s always going 
to be just the slightest bevel. And you're basically taking, when you're doing it that way, you 
can't help but get at least an inch, an inch and a half or more of basically averaging the shape 
from here to here, instead of getting specifically this place. Now you'll notice on some of the 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
7 
older instruments, like I've worked on an old Pfretzschner, old Hawkes, things like that. There 
are’really famous makers, and we're talking basses, the turn of the century and older, they'll have 
little pits and things like just in that area, nowhere else and you have a bridge that needs to fit 
into that whole thing. Ideally, you don't want anything obstructing the full transmission of 
vibration from here, down into the body. So with that, you've got to use something more precise 
than just rubbing back and forth over sandpaper. So that's what the worst shops do. And there's 
variations in between. 
 
DW  13:05   
What I do, what I've learned, is to first start this with a knife. And I should tell you this first, 
actually, I score this with a pencil, I hold it, it's just such an angle, and go across the blank foot, 
which is always like this fat when you first start, I should say it's about an inch, maybe more 
thick. It's an in the end, it's going to be millimeters thick, down here by the feet. [holding bridge 
to demonstrate] But I start with that and I score around it with a pencil to generally get the shape. 
From there is where I start carving each with a knife, the one that I made at my third 
apprenticeship—it was made for that purpose—until I get it to generally look like it's fitting 
everywhere. And it's at that point that I switched to glass. Now I learned this from David Gage, 
and every other luthier I spoke to about they're like "What?" So it's apparently really unique to 
his shop. And it's an undying resource, we go to any frame shop and they've got just the supply 
of broken framed glass—"Oh, please take this off our hands." So basically, there's a method to 
take a there's like a scorer that you can cut glass with—a glass cutter—you score, just like maybe 
five millimeters of the end of it. And if you break away at an angle, like the edge of a desk, you'll 
end up it'll end up breaking with a round-ish shape. And that becomes your scraper. And that too, 
can be super sharp and smooth. It's got a specific sound like "pfff, pffff" and you'll see little 
layers coming off. And then if you use it too long, it'll start sound like "crhhhh" and you'll see 
more crumbs and that's when it's time to break another piece. And so that's what I use for the last 
stages. And what I'm looking at at that point. I've put black grease pencil on the entire area, and 
I've rubbed just slightly—we're talking no more than, you know three or four millimetres back 
and forth. And I look at the bottom and I can see exactly where it's touching where it's not. That's 
a long story. But 
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
8 
JG  15:08   
I mean, the process is fascinating. And one thing that it made me think of is, you know, you're 
talking a little bit about the difference between these beloved instruments that are coming in that 
maybe aren't the highest quality versus these really, you know, incredible, one-of-a-kind 
historical pieces. You don't have to answer this completely, honestly.  
 
DW  15:30   
Okay. 
 
JG  15:31   
Do but do you spend the same amount of care on that crappy student violin that you—? 
 
DW  15:38   
I'm glad you did. 
 
JG  15:39   
—do on the really fancy upright bass? 
 
DW  15:41   
I sure do. I spend all that time and I'll tell you what's funny about that, why smile right away, is 
that's how I used to get in trouble at David Gage's shop. [laughter] 
 
JG  15:44   
Spending too much time on the bad instruments? 
 
DW  15:55 -16:53 [Redacted. Summary provided by interviewee: I really believed that every 
instrument (even cheap ones) could sound and feel great if you put the right things into it.  So, I 
got in trouble constantly, because I tried to give everybody the same attention and care 
regardless of what they asked and paid for, and without consideration of what was economically 
viable given the value of a particular instrument.] 
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
9 
JG  16:53   
Well, that is great. I mean, that's what you want to hear from your repair person of any stripe. 
 
DW  17:01   
Yeah, I would think so. 
 
KC  17:03   
What was David's theory about the glass? Is it just that it's so sharp? And you kind of can—like 
you know when it needs to start fresh from that super sharpness again? Or what was his working 
theory on why you use that technique.  
 
DW  17:22   
So we never discussed it in full. It's just he kind of told me things to do and I took them 
[crosstalk]. However, I can make sense of it, in thinking about it. We start with a knife. Well, 
actually getting this I picked that up later. . the knife approach. In his [David Gage’s] shop, they 
went straight from the bandsaw to the glass.  
 
DW  17:44   
I learned--it was that third apprenticeship--that they took manual tooling more seriously. They 
said we teach the old French approach and everything. I didn't know what that meant. Exactly. 
And he told me that also means you wear a blouse, I had to find out what that was. I grew up in 
New York! I'm like, okay, is that a t-shirt? [laughs] Is it a pirate shirt? He just meant a button up. 
I say, "Well, why didn’t you [just say that?]” Anyway. With an accent, he said [imitating], "We 
wear blouses." [laughing] Amazing guy, by the way. Robert Young spoke, I don't know how 
many languages. And he and you'd never know. Because he was so humble about it. He won't 
tell you what he knows, the right person has to come in and he engages in their language. 
"Robert, I didn't know you spoke...!" "Oh, it never came up." But anyway, that's where I got the 
knife thing. We had like no power equipment, everything was filed, planed, cut, etc. At Gage's 
shop, it was more bandsaw to the glass.  
 
DW  18:43   
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
10 
So, but let's assume that I was doing the knife at that point. You can get, a knife could be pretty 
sharp. But thinking about how smooth this surface is, as it contours, there is no way possible to 
cut that entire shape with a knife and it'd be perfectly smooth is going to be a little bit of level 
changing for each scoop of the knife. So you need something else that’s going to be smoother. 
Sandpaper is imprecise. So a scraper makes sense. Because it's rounded, I can now get inside of a 
plane, like here, if I just want to hit one spot, I need a rounded object to hit that one spot. 
However, if I use the typical metal scraper, I can't discern much from the sound. That's more for 
like ebony and longer surfaces, that kind of thing. The glass is refined enough that I can hear 
more in what's happening in the work. And I can see it better. You know, and also because it's, 
like I said before, a resource that doesn't deplete— 
 
JG  19:45   
A free tool.  
 
DW  19:46   
Yeah, whereas the metal you've got to re-crimp it and so forth every now and again. It's like it 
looks flat, but really the edge is slightly curled. And that's a sensitive curl at some point it blurs 
in different areas and has nothing to do but flatten the whole thing out with a heavier metal and 
then re-crimp that shape. 
 
KC  20:05   
Could you spell out your apprenticeships for us? Sort of rough—you know, who you were with 
and roughly how long? Maybe like how you got to numbers two and three? 
 
DW  20:18   
 To two or three?  
 
KC  20:20   
You said you had three apprenticeships, but we've heard most about David— 
 
DW  20:22   
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
11 
Right. So the first, the first and third were true apprenticeships. David was first and it was 
roughly, it's so hard for me to say, I'd have to—at least a year and a half, it might have been a 
little more than two. I should also mention, I moved a lot. As a kid, it was for different reason. 
Now, as an adult, it's so extremely hard in New York's real estate market to get an apartment, 
affordable space of any kind in your own name. So I would take a sublease. And what would 
happen is in a few months, either I get a different job somewhere else or the sub-letter, I guess 
you'd say?, needs the place back or they've got family coming or whatever like that. And I'm 
forced to uproot and go again. So I'm in different places each year. So most people, they 
remember things and time by where they were living. I can't do that. [laughs] 
 
DW  21:18   
At Gage's, I had probably four or five different apartments. So I can only generally estimate. So I 
was there for at least a year and a half. And second was Kolstein's out in Long Island, New York. 
Now I said, that wasn't a real apprenticeship, because there its more like a journeymanship. They 
expect I come, I've already got my tools, and so forth. And we just need this done and do that, 
you know, I wasn't there for education. [Redacted. Summary provided by interviewee: Also I 
personally felt that Barry had some truly unorthodox approaches that I wasn’t very comfortable 
with.] 
 
DW  22:56   
But anyway, last, Barry had this philosophy that no one should be able to tell, nobody, no client 
should be able to discern who did the work when they look at the instrument. So he would love 
to say, "There's one set of hands around here." Like we all do exactly like this, you cut this way, 
this thickness, don't do this extra bevel. Whereas at David Gauge's shop, there's some general 
standards as a baseline. And then on top of that, anything you do is your particular signature. So 
you can look at a bridge that came out of a bass, that came on a bass, from David Gage's shop 
and tell, "Oh Sprocket made this, or "Oh Mike did this—Oh Damon this this one!" Because of 
these little things that we do on the corners and stuff there lots of areas for personalization, I 
suppose. So all of those things were not present at Kolstein's, which is why I didn't learn 
anything. I just stayed and applied what I knew for a while. 
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
12 
KC  23:53   
Do they specialize—are they just all stringed instruments? 
 
DW  23:56   
Oh, yes, that's I should have specified that both of those shops were bass shops, specifically bass. 
(David Gage and at Kolstein's.) Now, Kolstein's is a bigger operation. It just there's a whole 
commercial component they make, you know, all kinds of like wood polishes and things like that 
they have manufactured, he has agreements with Chinese companies that produce things and you 
know, etc. He's got instruments that are built elsewhere and stuff like that. And he's so he 
shipping to clients around the world and things so it's a bigger operation, but a lot less refined.  
 
DW  24:31   
David Gage is world-famous mostly for his, you know, attention, its specificty with setups and 
things like that on the instrument, and also because of who he learned with. I know Barry learned 
from Samuel Kolstein, I have no idea who Samuel learned from.  And [with] David Gage, there's 
this lineage down from Chuck Traeger, who was world-famous and who wrote books that most 
luthiers buy now, when they have questions about things. He had two students. Those were 
David Gage and Bill Merchant. So that's my first two apprenticeships—strictly bass shops. And 
so that Barry thing, I only stuck out there probably eight months, 10 months, something like that 
before the third apprenticeship. 
 
DW  25:14   
That was Viseltear and Young that I mentioned before—Jason Viseltear, Jason Yo--no, no, 
Robert Young and Jason Viseltear, but the shop is called Viseltear and Young. And they did no 
bass at all, actually, strictly violin, viola, and some cello. And that was like another level of 
refinement up from what anything I'd experienced, not just in the tooling, everything— the 
blouse! That's right [laughs]. Even how we cleaned up, it was very specific, I had to put stuff 
down [over the floor] first and sweep slowly in just so you don't put dust particles and things into 
the air. We didn't think about that in the other shops, you walked across a pillow of dirt all the 
time, you slid in it. And there was no shop room with bandsaw, a sander etc, or anything like 
that. Like I said, everything was done by hand. And everything, even the brand-new instruments 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
13 
that we got in for sale, were all adjusted from the inside out. We would get a brand new cello, 
and opened it up to check the graduation, and correct it the way we wanted, to our specifications, 
and to listen to it. There's a point that you hold it, and you'd knock around the whole thing, and 
you're looking for a certain evenness of tone and in some cases for a specific tone—a note. And 
then we close it up and stuff. And that's the new instrument. And nevermind, the restoration on 
the jobs that we got in. So um, yeah, that was the last one. And I was that probably lasted about a 
year. Yeah. He was in Manhattan, those all three? Sorry, the first, the first and third, were in 
Manhattan. The second was out in Long Island. 
 
KC  26:53   
And how did you come to be a furniture builder? 
 
DW  26:58   
That too, was just luck. It's just I was at Pratt studying architecture. And financial aid just wasn't 
going well for me. And I needed to earn some more money to eat etc. And so I'm looking for 
work. And I started messengering and things like that I was one of those guys all around 
Manhattan on a bike, crashed a few times. You know what it's, it's no matter what it looks like, I 
felt much safer doing that, than I do riding a bike down here. 
 
KC  27:33   
I know what you mean, because in New York, they are expecting you. Whereas here people 
just— 
 
DW  27:38   
And you have more escape routes, just a simple sidewalk. You have so many stretches here with 
no sidewalk of any kind, sometimes no shoulder, the drivers to me are worse. You know, 
unskilled. There, you have close calls, mostly because somebody's skilled, but being aggressive. 
There's a difference in what you look for. And yeah, and they basically respect you, if you 
command the space, like you're in a car, you know, I come across and I want to make a right. 
they'll react to me like a car. Here, its almost like they didn't see me and just—boom!

DW  28:09   
But yeah, so I did that for a while and stuff. And then I found out through another student that 
there was a former student who had his own construction company. He was called Third Floor 
Construction. His shop was in the third floor of a building in Midtown. And he hired a few of the 
students, a couple of current and some former, including a good friend of mine. (We had our first 
band together, oh my God, what a horrible gig we had! But it's just terrible.) But uh, they were 
all working for this guy. They said, "Hey, you should meet so so he'll probably give you a job." 
That's how I got in. Now, being a construction company, we did everything from the landscaping 
and stonework to you know, custom closets and things like that. A lot of our clients were in 
Manhattan and had the kind of apartments you see on TV, where it's like, it looks like a regular 
nondescript building from the outside, but inside you have two floors connected, with like a 
spiral staircase. And so we'd have to go in places like this, and make like a custom entertainment 
center or, you know, or make a rooftop, you know, party deck, that kind of thing. And that in 
addition to the other places where we did roofing and landscaping, etc. So it was everything 
under one roof, so to speak. And he'll start—Ben, this guy's name was—he'll start sort of steering 
you towards things that you show aptitude for. And in my case, that was the wood and 
refinishing and stuff like that. So I found myself more and more indoors just working on the 
furniture. It became my thing.  
 
KC  29:45   
Nice. Where—Did you grow up in New York City? 
 
DW  29:48   
I did. Yes. 
 
KC  29:49   
Your parents were born there? 
 
DW  29:51   
Yes.  
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
15 
KC  29:52   
When were you born? 
 
DW  29:53   
1973. May 10, 1973. I was born in Brooklyn, New York. That's an interesting story in itself. I 
was born in Brooklyn, New York at a little hospital. There is Kings County Hospital, which is 
huge, everybody knows about Kings County in New York, and a little university hospital across 
the street. Downstate Medical. That's where I was born on May 10. That was the birthday of the 
doctor who delivered me. And he delivered 10 babies that day. [KC or JG, "Aw!"] Now here's 
what really sucks is that I learned this story later on. So I've been searching out details of my life 
and stuff and try to—I'd been doing a lot of research. So I finally find this out. And I find out the 
guy's name's MJ Kioki [sp?]. And I go searching and I found him (or where he was his number, 
and all that) just a few months after he passed away. I never got to have a conversation with him. 
But I still got to verify all the details. So I know the story is true. 
 
JG  30:50   
So I'm thinking back to the first conversation we had. And after you did these three 
apprenticeships, you struck out on your own?  
 
DW  30:59   
Yes.  
 
JG  31:00   
So this is where Dr. Bass was born?  
 
DW  31:03   
Yes.  
 
JG  31:03   
Could you like, you know, the birth story? 
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
16 
DW  31:08   
It was a dark wet tunnel and I went towards the light! [laughter] 
 
JG  31:14   
Could you tell us about that? Because you had a pretty unique business model it sounds like. 
 
DW  31:18   
Yeah, yeah. And by necessity, not because of any cleverness from me in the beginning. But, you 
know, initially it was— Basically, where do I begin with that whole thing? So basically, I was 
taking clients out of my apartments that I had, it was usually some little studio apartment. And, 
and it got to the point where the word was passing around, that this guy knows his stuff, he's 
really good, etc. So I started getting higher and higher profile clients, coming to my little humble 
studio. So they're sitting on my futon, where I sleep, while I'm working in a space—that should 
be where I ate—on a workbench, and, and it wasn't good, you know, for the optics of it was 
terrible. And not that they complain, but everybody kept trying to like, I don't know, beat me, 
you know, for cheaper prices. You know, I guess the idea was, "Hey, look, your renting your 
house, your apartment, how much do you really need? Do you have any business, charging what 
they charge downtown at Gage's shop?"  
 
DW  32:20   
And so I would run into that a lot of people like "Well, why don't you let me just give you this 
amount?" I never heard a conversation like that a David Gauge's or Kolstein's. Well, the other 
places they were big enough that I wasn't close to that. In Gage's shop it was small enough that I 
would hear overhear conversations and I never heard that happen—that kind of haggle. They 
might say, "Oh, wow, okay, well, I got to do it." And that's it. And me, I got to haggle all the 
time, I figured it had to be the studio apartment. And by New York standards, that means it's 
probably smaller than this room, some of those places I was in. And some of those same places 
go for, you know, a couple thousand now, it's just insane. And so I decided, maybe I've gotten 
big enough, you know—with the consistency, rather consistent that, I had enough consistent 
repair work, that maybe it's time for commercial space. And that's where I ran into so much 
trouble.  
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
17 
 
DW  33:14   
I couldn't get a space to save my life. We're talking storefront, loft, I tried it all. And the most 
amazing things would happen. You know, there'll be some, something completely definitive 
when a friend of mine calls. Or if I email, and when I showed up, suddenly, there's nothing 
available. Now I can give you some examples of things that happened along these ways. I'll give 
you one I suppose . . . One of them, the closest that I'd gotten was a loft space in Williamsburg, 
Brooklyn. And I met the person who owned the space, she was going to sell me that space. I 
already had money in hand. Now. I didn't go to a bank. I went to individuals, parents, and gave 
them my business pitch, my plan and so forth, and through that got financing. So now I had 
money in hand. And so I met with her. She was it turns out, she was a wood artist, a wood 
sculptor. And I thought, "Wow, how perfect!" and so forth. We signed an agreement, I gave her 
first payment,  got keys in my hand, I later got a call from a person who owned the floor. And 
they were like, "Oh, I heard such and such, you know, you know, made this agreement on her 
space, but I'm sorry, you can't have it." I said, "Why is that?" She said, "Oh, well, I learned that 
you work on instruments or something? And I said "Yes, I do." She said "Well, oh, it's because 
of the dusts. And this and that." I said, "Well, I don't use any—" I asked, "What about the dust or 
something? Oh, how much dust does she expect?" She said "Well with any kind of power tool, 
or a sander, or so forth." I said "Well, it just so happens your tenant is a wood sculptor and I saw 
this power sander and this—" I described what was in her space. And its at that point, she got 
really upset at me either then or right thereafter where I said, "Well, I don't even use those." 
Because at that point I didn't. I hadn't invested in a single machine yet. She, she got really upset 
and was like, "Well, this isn't over yet." And I later on got a call from the person over the 
building. That person said, "Okay, so and so told me, they spoke to you and she's wrong, yes, 
you can have the space. But here are these things you have to do to make it work." And he gave 
me a list. It was gonna be an air filtration system and all kinds of things that this person didn't 
have. It was going to be security system and so forth. Because I have clients coming and going. 
And so it's about the safety of the tenant. He said, "If you can do all these things, I still can't 
promise you, you can have long term, but it's at least enough to get started." This is the kind of 
thing I ran into.  
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
18 
DW  35:39   
Well, I would say the the worst example was down in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn, it's like, you 
see it in movies, it's like that little area between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. So loft 
buildings there. And from there, you can see the New York City skyline, it's perfect. And this is 
when I just gave up on the storefront idea, I'm like, "Okay, this is I'm not getting the right people, 
and I'm getting the runaround." And nobody cares about lofts, I thought. And at that point, there 
was nothing down there yet. There was some beatnik artists and stuff like that, who were, you 
know, sort of living real humbly sharing bathrooms and everything like that, calling themselves 
artists-in-residence and so forth. And that's it. Now, it's a real trendy area. And I saw on the news 
since then, that there was a lot of effort by the Association down there to give all kinds of 
subsidy to make people come with their businesses, not like—Hey, I was coming in to pay and 
everything. And that was one where I spoke to some of these artists, they're like, "Oh, man, yeah, 
it's real easy. They only want X amount of money and so forth." I'm like, "Well, what kind of 
records you have to provide? Oh, man, they only wanted to see like, two months in my bank or 
whatever." I said, "Okay, I could do that. You know. So I come, and I get an appointment, and a 
guy—shoot.  
 
DW  36:52   
First it was this first problem that I that I mentioned before of no spaces available, of all these 
buildings, and some of them you could see from the outside, hey, there's nothing in those spaces, 
you know? Well, nothing in my range. He's all, "That's a shame. You know, what, when? What 
range do you have?" And he's like, "Well, I do have another tour going up, and the next if you 
want to join us and so forth." And he showed us a space that was just immaculate, it was 
breathtaking. You could see both bridges and the skyline like I described. And I said, "Yeah, I'll 
bet this one's available." And he said, "It sure is." I said how much and he mentioned to the 
group because I was in a group tour. And just to see what he would do, I said, "I'll take it."  
 
DW  37:30   
"Oh, alright, meet me down at the office, I'll be there right after I finished a tour and so forth," 
like that. He comes down. And instead of giving me something from the immediate stacks and 
stuff like that, and like this little file thing behind him, he's digging down in like a drawer behind 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
19 
his desk. He's at it for a few minutes before producing a paper that had all of these demands on 
it, including, it was like either six or seven years of bank records and just an insane amount of 
stuff. And I remember looking at him, I said, "What are you doing?" [laughs] Like it was clear to 
me. "What are you doing?" And he just shrugged. You know, so it was clear to both of us what 
was happening there. That was a lot longer than I expected. The point is— 
 
JG  38:13   
It is interesting because you're like facing this discrimination, and, you know, it ultimately meant 
you moved out of the city to a place that like, you can get this incredible space, or at least that's 
what I understand from your story before. 
 
DW  38:28   
Yes. So it meant two things. First, first, the Dr Bass moniker, it was like, "Okay, this is not 
working, by any stretch of the imagination." What else could I do? And I somehow hit on the 
idea—It started with, I guess, a conversation with my best friend about how some of what I do is 
very much like operating. Its alot like physician work, especially when he come by my place. 
And he saw these little splinters that I had on the side. I said, "Be careful, don't knock any of 
those down." He was like, "What's all that is for?" And I explained why, with an old enough 
instrument, you want to maintain it as much of the original as possible. So all those pieces are 
gonna go back, you know.  
 
DW  39:06   
But anyway, it was around then that it occurred to me I could do doctor calls, like they used to do 
for medicine. And now I can charge a premium because you're paying for the benefit of 
somebody come all the way to your home, so you don't have to schlep across all New York with 
a bass on a subway or whatever else. And so that's where the Dr Bass moniker was first born. It 
was because I couldn't get commercial space. 
 
JG  39:28   
But its brilliant because you went from went from being like, having to undercharge people to 
then being able to— 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
20 
 
DW  39:34   
Yeah, exactly. I was able to change my economic circumstance in a hurry. And it was later on, 
trying to improve still yet again, that it occurred to me to move further south and west and down. 
It's down here I found it was very easy relatively to get a commercial space much bigger for less 
than I was fighting for at that time actually. 
 
JG  39:55   
Right, and in an area that has a lot of active music scenes. 
 
DW  40:00   
Yes, precisely, I checked the area out first. And I found that there are various schools here, all 
that have very good music programs, whether classical or jazz is so just a perfect fit. I'm like, 
there's gonna be plenty of work here. And I was right. 
 
JG  40:14   
Yeah. But you are also saying that you get clients from all over, not just from this immediate 
area. So you've got enough a reputation at this point that people seek you out? 
 
DW  40:25   
Yeah, I guess it's a mix of things. Part of it is reputation. So people come to me from Virginia, 
and you know, from places further east, and so forth, and south, but more to the north. Part of 
that is reputation, they're hearing from other people and so forth. The other part of it is just 
convenience. I think there are shops here in the Triangle dealing with violin dealing with cello, 
like I think but the bass? There's only one other bass shop. And that's out in Greensboro. So if 
you're further south, or further east, and everything like that, it just makes sense to try a place 
that's a little closer to you than drive more hours out to him.  
 
JG  41:02   
Yeah.  
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
21 
DW  41:03   
So it's been a mix of those things.  
 
JG  41:05   
Yeah, that's the point. I don't, I don't know that I've ever been in a bass shop. 
 
DW  41:09   
Yeah, exactly. It's a real thing. 
 
KC  41:12   
You—I don't think you're used the words exactly like this—but basically, part of the reason 
landlords were turning you down is because you're black? 
 
DW  41:24   
Yeah, yeah, I think I would have to say that. In this industry, I've run into a lot of bias, I think for 
two different kinds of reasons. Part of it is there are no black luthiers.  
 
KC  41:35   
That was my my next question. 
 
DW  41:36   
I've never read (about) one, saw one, one heard of one. I've gone to some conferences that you 
know, belong to some of the you know, the organizations and the guilds. And I've not come 
across another, not for bass. There's one that I met who's mixed the who deals with guitars, that 
kind of thing. And that's reason number one. Reason number two is usually a luthier is a really 
old European. As like a young guy, like, "How do I trust him with my fine instrument and so 
forth?" So when I first came down, it had to be with my portfolio in hand. So you don't take my 
word for it, just listen to what how I describe a repair, it's look at my work, you know, and that's 
how I got into doors down here before I opened my own shop. 
 
JG  41:52   
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
22 
What's that, like being so alone in the industry? 
 
DW  42:33   
It's tough, you know. Some of the some of that is a point of pride that I was able to do that and 
make a space for myself. And to succeed enough in that, that I can do it alone and not hold 
another job, because that's how I did for the first few years, I held at times two jobs and was 
doing lutherie. So part of that I feel proud about but there's a bigger part that's like despairing 
that there's no one then to, to mentor me.  
 
DW  43:04   
You know, it's like, almost like music, you can be a student of music for life, there's not going to 
be a point where you know everything about music and technique. If you think you do, you've 
made a mistake, you're going to limit yourself, and you're not that good, right? You're lying to 
yourself, for sure. And so even at my level, there are things that I was never trained on. Some of 
those I tackled on my own and just went at it intuitively, and found a way and along that way 
created some new processes that I was never taught. Like I have a way to—I won't get into that 
right now. But then in other things, it'd be great to have someone, others like me, or some or not 
even those like me, but those outside of me who would be willing to, to have that kind of 
relationship with me. In my case, they're all competitors. Everybody keeps everything close to 
the vest. And I have to just do what I can alone. 
 
KC  44:04   
Is that because you've like, in a sense, aged out of apprenticeship? So then, its master luthiers 
stop sharing skills? 
 
DW  44:19   
Aged out. I don't think it's an age thing. I think it's I don't know, I think it's just simply that I left 
my apprenticeships behind. It's like if you go somewhere else, either you’re an apprentice and 
you work in my shop and I teach you everything, or, you know, that's it. Whereas I see others 
professionally, they can hold the shop and still there's someone else they can talk to about 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
23 
technique and approach and so forth. I've just not been afforded that. Everyone seems threatened 
by my presence. 
 
KC  44:51   
Have you had any opportunity to teach others? 
 
DW  44:55   
Oh, yes. It's not gone well. [laughter] it's basically I've had several apprentices and they fall on 
one end of the spectrum or the other. So the first thing is this, I don't yet feel confident that I can 
afford to pay a full grown adult what they would need to live. That's the crux of my problem. 
Because I'm now limited to the young person pool of like high school students or just recent 
grads, that kind of thing. And with that comes a lot of dependability issues, focus issues, you 
know, things like that. And they're not sure what they want to do yet. So I've had two, for 
example, who we've made it really far as like, okay, you show clear aptitude, you're paying 
attention to the small details, this is excellent. And I'm teaching them everything that I know, 
trying to get them up to speed. And by the time that they're close to the point where I feel like, 
maybe you can open and take some repairs Monday, while I'm not here.  
 
DW  45:54   
Each of those decided it was time to do something else. It's like, "You know, I always thought 
about so and so and now I got this opportunity. "Oh my god." So on the one hand, I have to be 
happy for you, you've got to do what you're intended to do, you know, or you'll be miserable. 
And that'll reflect in the work, you know, so I'm not going to hold you back. But on the other 
hand, "Darn!" That was a huge investment [of time and money] on my part.  
 
DW  46:19   
You can mess up really badly in a short amount of time here. So it's not like you were training 
and I was doing other things. So they happen at the same time, I had to stop what I was doing to 
give you my full attention and make sure you didn't go off that track. And now that was for 
nought. So that's happened to me at least twice with people who were really good at this. The last 
one, he still comes on holidays and things like that. He ended up getting a full ride scholarship to 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
24 
play bass and study bass at some school conservatory. An excellent model individual, you know, 
amongst young people. Multilingual, excellent on the bass, and just his appreciation and love, it 
was almost poetic. But he, that's an excellent opportunity. So those two, are on one end of the 
spectrum, and the other end of all of the rest. [laughs] 
 
DW  47:09   
"Oh, I was supposed to be here at nine?" "Oh." And "Don't do that!" You know, things I 
shouldn't have to say, you know, one of them. It's funny now, but at the time, it really blew my 
mind that I feel like I'm talking to a young kid. But here he was, a high school grad that, you 
know. We get in a load of instruments from a school out in Burlington. And one of them, we 
open the case and it's got black all over. We don't yet know if this is some kind of growth, you 
know? God of you never know, you know, because of the different conditions that they store 
their instruments in places, if you got some kind of mold. And so I said, "Okay, don't move." 
You know, "Don't touch that," or whatever. "Let me get us a couple of masks," you know, 
whatever. I turned around to get the masks, and I turn back, he's touched it, [claps] doing this 
clapping in the air to see the pattern in the air, the dust. I said, "Stop it! What are you doing?," 
you know, things like that. That just, just. It still leaves me dumbfounded. You know, I 
remember being a high school student. I started working back when I was 13. So I remember 
from then on up, nobody had to tell me the obvious. "Don't play with that because it's sharp" and 
"Don't hit this because it might be chemical or whatever." You know, it's—I don't understand 
what's happened between me and now this. So 
 
JG  48:35   
Wow, smartphones? I don't know. There's all sorts of technology that I think is ruining us. But, I 
mean, it seems like you just have to find a unicorn who's like, loves the instruments, has hand 
skill, has focus, attention to detail, and like, wants to invest their life in it. And it is. I mean, 
we've, we've encountered several trades, that it's increasingly hard to find people to kind of take 
up the the trade as an apprentice or you know, to take over a business. So that's really that's a 
shame. I hope you find that person. 
 
DW  49:11   
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
25 
I do, too. It's a lot to keep up with just me. 
 
JG  49:15   
So much! I can't believe it's just you back there. I mean, it's a huge job. 
 
DW  49:17   
Yeah. And it's, yeah, it's why I'm a little bit behind on some of the repairs. But people so far have 
been very understanding, in allowing extra time, understanding that in the end, it's gonna be 
worthwhile and so forth. I remember my first attempt to teach someone was back in New York, 
and that was an adult. And in his case, there was this, there was something else missing. Here, he 
was a serious business owner, so forth. He was working on wind instruments. And so we were 
trying to combine a little bit, I was going to help him get stringed instruments and we’re gonna 
have a bigger operation. And for him, it was the lack of love and appreciation for the sound. You 
know that sound guides everything you do. And he's like, you know, cutting corners. "Wouldn't 
be easier if we just do this?" "No, you don't do that, because then you don't get this and so forth. 
Have you thought about what it takes to create this kind of growl? It's got to be just such a 
shape." And I'm describing the shape. At that point was like a Nike swoosh. And he was like, 
"Well, if I use this scraper, it'll be kind of like a semicircle, and that should be close enough." 
"No, it doesn't work like that!" You know. So yeah, it's not just those adult features of focus and 
responsibility and seriousness, but it's also that love and appreciation for the thing that you are 
crafting. 
 
KC  50:29   
It's almost like luthiers are, you know, not only sort of excellent repair artisans, but also, like the 
way you talk about it, and the multisensory, and the history, it's almost also like a sommelier or 
something like that.  
 
JG  50:45   
Totally.  
 
DW  50:46   
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
26 
Well thank you, I would put it in that territory. Sure. Yeah. 
 
KC  50:50   
Tell us about some of the, like, a job that you're particularly proud of. 
 
DW  50:58   
Wow. That's tough. I've had so many, I would say. God, so tough! One of them is a bass. It was 
this $17,000 Viennese bass. And it was like, it was a serious instrument. And it was made for a 
young man who was over at a conservatory and years past. And now he'd gotten past that and so 
forth, and was now professional. He was from up north, I believe, Massachusetts, or something. 
And now he's down here just living and working as a professional, like programmer or 
something down in Raleigh. And he's thinking, well, now he has the time, income, etc, to start 
playing again, at least for himself. Maybe not to go to the professional level of performance with 
the North Carolina Symphony anything like that. So his parents decide, you know, well they 
decided amongst themselves, that they'll bring his bass down here to Raleigh from 
Massachusetts, wherever it was, his parents are elderly. And so they drive it, across states, all 
this way, nothing goes wrong. They get—it's heartbreaking—all the way down to this son's foyer 
when the father trips and falls into the bass, [KC and JG exclaim] it hits the floor, he falls 
through the front of it. And it turns out, it was the owner himself, his wife, and the father all 
called me independently. The wife said, "Look, I searched online or read reviews, I heard about 
your shop, and let me describe my husband's bass. . . " and asked if I could fix it, and so forth. 
And I said, "Sure!" She said, "But don't tell them, I called you if you happen to the call." I get the 
call from the Father, "Look, I messed up my son's bass. [laughs] Don't tell him I called!" The son 
himself calls eventually. So apparently the reviews were good enough that all of them were led 
to the same source. And in the end, I did go with the son's specifications, etc. But the father made 
me promise not to let him know that he'll be paying—that the Father will be paying.  
 
DW  53:11   
So it's not just that this is all crushed in. It's mostly that it's split exactly along the bass bar. 
Basically, it's a bass. [Demonstrates on bass] From here, about, to about here. Inside along the 
top, there's what we call a bass bar that runs this entire distance. And it's some places put them in 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
27 
there with what we call spring. Basically, it's like once you have this top out laying on the table, 
you have a form for it, and you leave a little bit of space, and then you drop some weight into it 
so it goes flexes down into the shape. And then you fit the base bar to fit that shape. And then 
you take the weight back out. So now it's in tension.  
 
KC  53:59   
The bass bar is wood? 
 
DW  54:00   
Yes, everything inside there is all wood. So it's now in tension. And so that gives deliberately the 
kind of spring the kind of projection that it has and sends the vibrations going this way. Now 
opposite that bass bar, which happens to run into the bridge foot, which is why I mentioned 
earlier, adjusting the bridge to catch up with the fingerboard, you don't just move the whole 
bridge over, it's got to stand exactly on that bass bar. And the opposite has to stand in front of 
what we call a sound post, which sends vibration that way. So you keep the feet in the same 
place and lean to top to wherever the fingerboard is. Anyway, because so many things that all 
come into play—I should also mention this: The bridge is one of the few things including the 
soundpost inside, there's no gluing or anything. It is only tension holding it specifically in just 
this place where it was designed to stand. And this is important for the whole thing working 
operating properly. So because there's so much tension coming to bear exactly at that point, that's 
the worst place for a crack to be. Anywhere out here on the edges, you can just kind of glue it 
together, you know, and it's there's nothing pushing on it. So it'll stay together, probably. We do 
other things to back it up, we'll put like a cleat inside, it's like little pieces of wood. And we'll put 
like linen cloth in between that so something like a suture. But under the bass bar, now we're 
talking active pressure pushing on that place. So this is an example of one of the things that I was 
never trained on. But I thought my way through it, and it worked out so well, that I ended up 
doing it with some other really tough projects, like a cello, that had a sword thrown through it—
long story—in one side out the other. But it meant removing the bass bar, obviously, because 
there's crack underneath it, then what was left, gluing it together first, and then carving down into 
that.  
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
28 
DW  55:55   
Of course, first measuring every square inch, how thick or thin the bass was from here to here. 
Because in the end, I'm gonna be mirroring that when I finalize, you know, my graft. So 
measuring all that, then after it was glued together, carving down into it, taking new wood, new 
spruce and putting it on top, fitting it in down into that shape, and then, but fitting it on an angle. 
So that way your woodgrain doesn't match that woodgrain, otherwise the split will just continue 
straight down. And then feathering down the edges until a point where it felt like one piece of 
wood again, you'd only see that there's this patch. That was my very first graft. And again, I was 
not trained on that. I did reference Chuck Traegers book for some of the finer points. But yeah, 
that was all me. I did a bigger patch for the belly and smaller ones for the top and bottom 
portions. And then regular kinds of glue work on the rest of the top and was able to put this 
whole thing back together in such a way that almost none of the work showed up. What did was 
so fine. It it looked like maybe you had a slight crack. It didn't look anything like a person fell 
through it. And it sounded great.  
 
JG  57:11   
Were they pleased?  
 
DW  57:12   
Oh, they were very pleased. Yeah. 
 
KC  57:14   
Do you keep a record of a job like that, like do you have a  file of before and after photos? Or is 
it all just up here? 
 
DW  57:21   
No, I sure do. I um, I have, it's got to be millions of photos of all the work that I've done. And it's 
a problem now because I've got this new website that's about to be launched soon, hopefully. 
And I hope you didn't see what was up there presently, its horrible, it was something my wife 
threw together for me years ago and it's been co-opted. But anyway, I have a new site that's 
being professionally created. And it's really nice so far. And for it, they wanted repair shots 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
29 
before and afters. And I just, I didn't realize how many photos I had amassed of like all my 
repairs. So it took days just to go through one year of photos. So there are jobs like that, that—I 
had so much trouble trying to find out of the timeline so that I can then send this to the company. 
That one I did find, but some of other ones, I still haven't. 
 
KC  58:13   
When you open an instrument, what kind of signs can you read from the people who repaired it 
before you? 
 
DW  58:22   
Well, that's interesting, it varies. There a couple of things that I look for. One of them is this lazy 
thing where a person a luthier will glue some edges together or glue a patch inside and you'll see 
like patterns of like either a brush or a sponge that they use, or sometimes droplets of the glue. 
All it takes is a few seconds after, you know you finish clamping something up to go back in—if 
it's closed, presumably—I have, like on a metal, you know, flexible metal rod, a sponge. And I 
go in and I wipe all those places before it dries. That's all it takes. And so I hate opening them up 
and seeing all of that glue evidence all over everything. In some cases, glue all over the label 
inside the instrument that to me is just so unprofessional. I've also seen the weirdest things. 
Going to open instrument and finding nails. You're not supposed to nail any part of an acoustic 
instrument together. You know, I've seen like at the corner blocks or at the top blocks they're 
putting nails. I've seen at least two finish screws used. Also this—Oh god. 
 
DW  59:30   
Sometimes you'll have a split. Here. This is a famous point to split in a neck, just where the neck 
meets the body. This is just ripe if you happen to drop it or hit something. This is the area of 
most tension. This is where it's going to break. And I've seen so many places where they screw 
straight through your fingerboard and either with a screw or with a wooden dowel, put something 
through all of this . . . And then that that wood that's left up here. It—One, it doesn't look 
professional by any stretch. But two, it changes. This is ebony going this direction, and you now 
put maple or spruce going that direction, it's endgrain, and at some point, just with time and 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
30 
sweat, whatever, it swells out. And so now it's uneven. You might have buzzing in this area, if 
you play any notes before it.  
 
DW  1:00:20   
What you're supposed to do is take the time—and sometimes difficulty—of taking the 
fingerboard off, putting that work straight into the neck itself, then putting the fingerboard back 
over top. So there's now no evidence of what's below. I've seen the opposite of people going 
through the back, and then you see this big hole back here. Oh my god. So those are some of the 
things that I've run into on the inside from previous luthiers. 
 
KC  1:00:47   
You said you leave signs on the bridge as your mark. Is there another example of that kind of, 
sort of signature to your work?  
 
DW  1:01:00   
There are small things. Like for example, I mentioned the cleats that go—if there's a crack here, 
you might find cleats on the inside of the crack. [Stammers] So one, there's so much variation in 
those.  
 
DW  1:01:16   
Some shops do bigger pieces and some do, you know, anywhere from pretty big, all the way 
down to really tiny. So that's the first thing. The second is then if they do it, if this crack is here, 
if they go straight along the crack versus turn the pieces like diamonds, (that's another 
difference). Two, if they bevel the edges of that piece, that's another difference. And last, if they 
stagger the pieces along that crack, to consider the woodgrain. So in my particular case, there—
about, what is that? Probably 15 millimeter square, always beveled on the side, but never all the 
way down to the edge of my case, because then you end up with an edge that's just so thin that 
it's just ripe to one day start curling up or something, maybe moisture, getting in there.  
 
DW  1:02:09   
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
31 
I like to leave just about a millimeter of straight wall before it beves up. In my case, they're 
almost always even on each side, you don't have like a thick side and the thin side. And then 
when I carved down the overall thickness, I never go any thicker than that, about five 
millimeters. And last in my case, and I don't see this often, I always, always, always stagger 
them along the crack. Because if you put them in a straight line—this is something I started to 
allude to earlier—the edges (like your crack is here, now you got these woodchips here). The 
edges of those, if they all conform on one line together, you've created a point of tension along 
that woodgrain. And that's where your next crack is going to happen.  
 
DW  1:02:50   
So if I stagger out, this is stopping on the grain here. My next one is going out the other 
direction. One after that might be either one, a couple of grains beyond or a couple of grains back 
one way or another all on different grains. So that would be my signature if you look at the 
inside. 
 
KC  1:03:13   
I have a funny question here. It seems like you, you like signs and you know notice the, almost, 
numerology of your birth? Do you have superstitions when you repair a bass? 
 
DW  1:03:31   
No, I don't. I just generally know that if I feel good. . . I don't have to worry about some of you 
know, the, the technical parts of, "Did I adhere exactly to the thickness right here or this—?" I 
know just by the way I feel, and the work feels under my hand that it is going to sound great 
when it's back together again. And I've never been proven wrong.  
 
DW  1:04:01   
There's a couple of times I didn't feel so great. I had things happening, or felt upset, or depressed, 
or whatever. But I knew I had to do this work. And so I'm working on it, and it didn't sound so 
great. I had to make adjustments. So I respect that now. Like if I don't feel great, and I try my 
best explain this to my wife. [laughs] She's got a regular job at a desk and it's like, you know: 
"Well you've had x time, why isn't that done?" You know, "Because now you're telling me that 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
32 
this is behind?" "I didn't feel right. You know, I don't have your kind of job. I need to feel some 
way—" This is art. You know, at the same time, it's these other things, you know? Yeah, yeah, 
that's what I can say about that. But no other particular superstitions. I don't have to wear black 
socks while I do this kind of instrument [laughs]. 
 
JG  1:04:49   
Any last things you'd like to put on the record? 
 
DW  1:04:53   
Oh, goodness. I'm so sorry.  
 
JG  1:04:55   
No, this is great! 
 
DW  1:04:56   
I wish I had thought about it ahead and I could have thought of great things to share. I didn't 
think about it all. I was just too busy. So now I'm wondering, did I talk enough about some of the 
things that matter? I really don't know the answer to that. I'm just saying, I'm wondering if—? 
 
KC  1:05:17   
Have you had any particularly—oh, go ahead, you look like you had a thought to share. 
 
DW  1:05:20   
Yeah. Well, just again, about my, I guess, my philosophy that all instruments deserve a chance, 
and all can feel and sound great. And I'm remembering that at that first apprenticeship, we'd 
gotten to the point where I was doing some of my setup stuff on some of the older instruments, 
you know. (There's cheaper instruments and some of those that were just in the ceiling 
downstairs in the basement of that shop, multiple floors.) And I needed stuff to work on. He's 
like, "Why don't you pull one of those from down there in the rafters and see what you could 
do."  
 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
33 
DW  1:05:54   
And I started making them sound better than the new instruments. So all his prices went up. 
Those were good examples of what's possible with the old beaters. I remember one of them. 
Christian McBride—who's like one of the top players in New York—came by the shop. That 
was normal for David Gage's shop, you'll have a star in there a couple times a week. And it's 
like, "Oh my God! I've read your name on so many album credits, and here you're standing and 
smoking," so forth. And Gary Peacock never stopped smoking.  
 
DW  1:06:25   
But, you know, so he would have all these bigs come to his shop. Only one. Yeah, out of my 
whole time, there had me just completely shut up, like—star struck. It was Ron Carter. And I've 
gone to a lot of his shows and everything like that. And it he still, his name still resonates. And 
he was standing at my bench talking to me. And at some point, that realization hit me. And I 
forgot everything that I'd been saying. I was just looking at him and blinkin and, and I thought he 
would help me, like, "You were saying so forth . . ."  
 
DW  1:07:00   
He just turned and walked away. I felt horrible. But anyway, I was gonna say something about 
Christian McBride first. Here was this bass we called "the stealth." It was an old beat up body, 
somebody painted it black. And it was stuck in the roof down there without a neck and 
everything. It was a headless wonder. And I took this thing and put the massive setup on it and 
new hardware, all silver. 
 
KC  1:07:23   
Did you strip it? 
 
DW  1:07:23   
No, we kept it black. And then on the new neck, painted the scroll, everything else, black. Thus: 
"the stealth." And silver hardware. And it just growled and roared like nobody's business. It was 
great. And Christian McBride came through. And he had, he had a bag in his hand and so forth. 
And he's making talk with everybody. He's like, "Yeah, yeah" and so forth. And he's like, so 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
34 
what do you have? You know, like, kind of what's the new thing right now? They said, well, 
"Sam's been working on and so forth" Well, the guy who had a bench across from me—I should 
come back to that—the bench situation. But anyway. And he played a couple of instruments 
from there and stuff. And he's like, "Okay," you know, he still had his bag, you know? And I had 
to say, "Hey, why don't you try this? I just finished." And Dave gave me this look as if like, 
"You're too new. What are you doing talking to this guy?" But he took it. He's like, "Oh, that's 
interesting, black. Okay." He took it and he hit a couple notes. [vrrrrrr vrrrrrr, imitates low bass 
notes] And he said, "Oh!" And he put his bag down. And he couldn't stop playing. Every now 
and again. He looked at it. And he was like, "No, I really can't. I've got too many instruments." 
He was that close. He was only visiting! 
 
DW  1:08:33   
In the end, this bass went to somebody who played in a band called The Brooklyn Bums. They 
stand on their instruments. It's like almost a vaudeville act. And it just to me, wasn't worthy of 
that instrument, you know. But. 
 
DW  1:08:47   
Two things I would like to tell you, if you got time.  
 
JG  1:08:48   
Of course! Go for it. 
 
DW  1:08:48   
I remember an instrument that meant more to me that I might have mentioned to you—the 911 
bass? Okay. And the bench situation.  
 
DW  1:09:02   
In that first shop, I was called "the chef." And here's why. [laughs] Because David wasn't looking 
to hire anybody. He didn't have room. They didn't prepare for that. So I had to basically gut what 
was the kitchen area in the back and create my own space. Thus: "the chef." They said, "What do 
you got cooking back there?" And all that stuff. And it was funny there was so often I would 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
35 
have to come way across the sales floor everything up to the front where the other benches were 
to the main tool area. And by the time I got there I had forgotten what tool I was coming for. 
And it happened so often that they knew when I was standing there. . . And they would try to 
help. "Is it this? Is it that?" So I was way in the back. I was the chef hiding in the kitchen.  
 
DW  1:09:45   
But yeah, the basses. Looking for a good example of one that meant so much to me. I don't know 
how I overlooked this one. I call it the 911 base. 
 
DW  1:09:54   
There's just so much history in it. Wow. So this is a bass that basically came to me in pieces. It 
belonged to a guy who was kind of a bassist, he was primarily a visual artist, Terry Atkins. 
Maybe heard of him? He's got installations in New York and stuff like that. And he teaches at a 
school in Philadelphia, at a college, I don't remember which one. And he does a lot of searching 
and stuff like that in his spare time, and he'll find deals on things. And he found this bass that 
was just a wreck, but technically was old and whatever. So he bought all these pieces.  
 
DW  1:10:31   
It came to me in two boxes. [laughs] And this is when I was working out of my home. And 
basically, the short of it is that I've worked on this thing for like eight months. We're talking full 
restoration from the inside out. This is the first time I'd gone that far since going on my own after 
the apprenticeships. And along the way—I cut myself a couple of times so I bled into this 
thing—along the way. I mean, this is it comes back to some of those foundations that I left 
behind, like the importance of a sharp tool. If you've got it super sharp knife, if the work is 
easier, you can control it better, if it's dull at all, you got to fight with the wood, and then it can 
jump off. And that's how I cut myself badly on this thing, every reappreciated the value of the 
sharp tool.  
 
DW  1:11:21   
But also along the way, him being a visual artist, he would always look for the right look that he 
wanted this instrument to have. And I've already started the staining process. With these 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
36 
instruments, it's not one layer of anything. It is many coats to get to where you are and where you 
see depth down through to the bottom coat, the ground coat. And lots of dry time in between all 
those coats. And varnish layers in between. And he would come to me with samples. "Hey, man, 
I found this table leg, if you can make it look kind of like this, you know, but a little more. . .? I 
was like, "Oh god, Terry, you know, I've already done this. Okay, fine. You're the client" you 
know. So this would happen a couple of times a month, it seems that he would find samples and 
bring them in. "I know I said this, but I'm thinking more. . ." And then there were parts that you 
don't usually color the he wanted me to stain symmetrical effect. So he wanted me to stain the 
bridge so that it matched the neck.  
 
DW  1:12:19   
That was okay, what really threw me, he wanted me to paint the fingerboard black. So there's 
some instruments, really cheap ones, that have what we call "ebonized" finger boards. I don't 
have one here. But basically, they take a really cheap, regular wood maple, whatever, and 
painted it black to make it look like ebony, which is the ideal wood for that surface because of 
the way you play on it. And the strings grinding on it, etc. It's the most dense. Yes, it's got the 
density. And the sound ultimately, it's got the right—I guess sound characteristic. The spectrum 
of sound around a note, when you fret a note on the board. You might have some other dense 
wood that just doesn't sound as good. It can still sound funky. Ebony has proven to match that 
well, both those needs, strength and tone.  
 
DW  1:13:08   
And he had a real ebony fingerboard, but it just happened to not be straight black. Sometimes 
they have these naturally occurring streaks. He's like, "Well, yeah, it's just those streaks man. 
And they kind of throw off from this. Now if you could just paint the whole thing black, I think 
that'd be nice." So I just finished about the third version of the body color. When he asked me 
that. So I checked, it didn't seem too tacky. So I put towel over the body to protect it, painted the 
neck—the fingerboard black despite all my attempts to talk him out of it. And the next day, went 
to take the towel off. It stuck to the bass. I had to rip it off. [KC/JG gasp] There was my color 
ruined. I had to wash out, sand, and start over again. So the thing is that I just went through so 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
37 
much work and effort on this bass, partly my doing, partly by a difficult client. Also who, along 
the way, kept on talking me down on costs every step of the way.  
 
DW  1:14:02   
"Hey, I came across this person in Utah (this whatever city) who said that they do this for x 
amount of money." And I kept on [trying to make him understand], "This is New York, they 
don't pay New York rent. Anyway, so lots of trouble into it and everything in in the final stages 
of it. It's almost finished. And it was just when you play down the G string I had a couple of 
spots that a couple of spots between like D flat and F that were buzzing, which meant to me that 
somewhere in this area, there was a slight hump.  
 
DW  1:14:38   
So I just, that was the last thing that had to happen. Everything else was done. All the color. The 
different head sets that he me change to. And it meant sealing the holes every time he wanted a 
change. You know you have to put wood in into the shape of the hole and everything ,cut off the 
excess, glue it down in there, so now you have a clean surface to sand and redrill. I've done that 
three times on this bass.  
 
DW  1:14:59   
All of those things were done. And only that was left. And I was just moving to my new 
apartment from Brooklyn up to Harlem, when we found this problem of the buzzing. I said, "Oh 
god, Terry, I'm moving in a couple of days. . " You know. So I figured, "Okay, I got to take this 
thing with me." And so I had the pictures now where I have this empty space, that's my new 
studio. And I only have a bed setup. And that's this bass laying on the bed, while I'm planing that 
area. 
 
DW  1:15:25   
But first, I had to risk my life to get the bass. It's a long story. Oh, my God, New York. The 
landlords can be really bad. And this guy wanted, because I had a full shop set up, but I did a 
system, basically a wall that was self supporting, inside the room. So it looked like I've nailed up 
shelves everywhere, but I hadn't. And this guy said to me, "Oh, you know, you owe X amount, 
afc2020009_007—Damon Walker interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
38 
you know, because all the holes in the walls." I said, "I promise you there's not a single hole." 
Long story short, he didn't want to believe me yet. And so I went and moved part of my stuff and 
came back and found he changed the locks already, basically to hold my stuff hostage until I can 
give him whatever additional. So there was this whole thing where I had to climb out of one 
window and across, three stories up, to get into the open window, to the main space, to get this 
guy's bass. Again, lots of trouble into this bass, including my physical blood.  
 
DW  1:16:19   
Last though, I'm just doing those final touches in the new apartment, on my bed, when 911 
happens. And it just so happens that the color we arrived at was like a deep, somewhere between 
deep blood red and brown, it was somewhere right in between. And I'm working on this thing. 
And I hear sirens constantly outside. And this is Harlem. You know, I learned later on how it 
works. That if there is a response. . . to big a response further down in Manhattan, uptown has to 
mobilize to cover their territories. So that's why I kept hearing fire engines every few minutes. 
And at some point, I'm thinking goodness, this must be big, maybe something in my 
neighborhood? I went to put my TV on to see. And it was nothing but static. I kept flipping, 
flipping. I finally found two channels that came through. Both of those, what do you call it?—
broadcast from the Empire State Building, which was fine. The rest of them where it was static, 
they broadcast from the World Trade [Center]. So that's when I finally got to the right station. 
And I saw it was happening.  
 
DW  1:17:21   
"Oh my god!" You know, this is huge. And my first thought was—First, I thought of my best 
friend who I was studying architecture with in Pratt, who was working at the World Trade, 80-
something floor. He's okay, he made it out. And I said, "I got to get to him." I try to call him on 
my cell phone, there's no signal because the world was calling. They crashed the system. So I ran 
downstairs to the payphone, you know, and even the payphones weren't working. I've never 
experienced that in my entire New York life.

And so my thought after all of that was to capture this moment. And I'm looking at this bass, this 
pain-in-the-mmm bass, its painted a deep blood color and this moment. And I started taking 
pictures. My TV, what was happening with World Trade. The bass. My ashtray, I was still 
smoking at that point. And I still have all of this now.  
 
DW  1:18:16   
In the end, it ended up being, I promise, something like the third best bass I ever heard. It had a 
sound to me that was like, if you cut butter with a really, really sharp knife, you know. So it's 
like, it's got that warmth and that softness of the butter. But it's still clear and focused at the same 
time. You can move this much space—like just a couple of millimeters on the fingerboard—and 
hear a difference of note. It was that precise. And all of that to go to this. . . . [laughs] This guy 
who was so concerned with the aesthetic, where to put it. He had a space for it in his library. And 
he's talking about the visuals of it, and if it's colored just right. It's like: You don't deserve all of 
this history! All this work. All of this sweat and blood. 
 
JG  1:19:10   
Yeah, it's amazing how that— 
 
DW  1:19:11   
Yeah, that one still breaks my heart.d 
 
JG  1:19:16   
—crystallized a moment for you.  
 
DW  1:19:16   
Right. And keep in mind. It began—this came to me in a couple of boxes, it was garbage. And 
when I opened it—I mean the the frontmost part and saw that somebody's taken two different 
kinds of wood and put it together. There was so much work ahead of me. A lot of people would 
have turned it down.

There are a number of basses actually that came to my shop, when I was out of my studio, that 
David Gage had turned down in the past. And so I took it for that reason. Like I remember this. 
You came to the shop. I'll take it and help you. I think I told you about one of them. Yeah. 
[crosstalk] 
 
JG  1:19:50   
Even an amateur eye can tell. 
 
DW  1:19:51   
Yeah exactly. But that was a much better example than the Viennese I think. 
 
JG  1:19:58   
Its fascinating, you've seen it all. t's, it's incredible to be able to take something from, you know, 
something a very simple repair all the way up to like a complete rebuild. 
 
DW  1:20:09   
Yeah. 
 
KC  1:20:11   
I'd love to get a little audio of you like, yeah, like— 
 
DW  1:20:16   
Playing? 
 
KC  1:20:16   
Maybe showing us, like how you like almost do. . . diagnostics with the

I have quite a few players now who are bluegrass and who are rockabilly and things. And they 
want "thump, thump, thump." They don't want growl, you know. Or with classical, they're 
looking for something different. So all of those are going to direct how I approach the 
fingerboard shape, the height and position of the bridge, the height, and the string slots, all of 
those things, and the location of that sound post inside—all dictate what sound is going to come 
out. Whether its "thump, thump" or "growl, grow" ("growl, growl" in this case is a jazz bass). So 
it's lower than that, [sounds of bass twisting around] the sound post happens to be further 
outside. This fingerboard is slightly scooped, it's almost flat, its got a slight scoop to it that 
happens to be deepest further up.  
 
DW  1:21:34   
All of those things are going to make it [plays] do that kind of [plays] I guess the strings a little 
bit old too. [playing]  
 
DW  1:21:47   
But anyway, so all of those are going to tell me if I'm looking for [sounds out bass note] or if I'm 
looking for [sounds out another note "boom"] and if I want it to be a short boom or if I want a 
sustained boom. Then that is going to tell me what I need to do across this whole thing. [plucking 
and playing different notes] 
 
DW  1:24:04   
Already slipped off the string like twice. 
 
KC  1:24:08   
It is amazing to think of all the variables that add up to that sound though. 
 
DW  1:24:12   
Yeah, and in this place, I was listening specifically for a certain style and intensity. I couldn't 
stop and tell you what I was listening for along the way but trust that there is a feeling along 
there. [plays up and down the fingerboard, demonstrating what this bass can do]

DW  1:24:48   
So yeah, this is more of a jazz bass. I played those classical pieces, to show there's still a little bit 
of crossover, where I'm looking for some of the similar thing. But technically, what is wrong 
with this setup is, if I play with a bow, there would have been all kinds of buzzing happening. So 
for that I'm looking for a deeper scoop here, and probably more arch here. So that I can bow and 
not touch other strings when I don't want to. 
 
KC  1:25:17   
One last question, unless you have any final thoughts. Did you put your tools on a doctor's bag 
when you were—? [laughter] 
 
DW  1:25:26   
I did not, that would have been cool. But there's a, I guess, I had to carry a great amount of stuff. 
Basically, I had to carry a table. You know, I learned the hard way, the first couple of house 
calls, I didn't think of that, I had to go down on the floor, on my knees. Somebody's got pictures 
out there of me on their floor, on my knees, working on a bass. So I started carrying a fold-up 
table.  
 
DW  1:25:57   
There are a couple of long things, like a straight edge ruler that I had to use for your fingerboard 
to check the scoop that I want. And then like, there's a couple of times that I found that I needed 
to drill something. "Darn it, I don't have my hand drill here, I'm going to come back." So I got to 
this point where my kit involved basically, at least one small representative, of all parts of my 
shop, you know, so so I can be ready for any circumstance, whether it's to drill, to cut, to 
whatever. And so that just meant a lot of weight. So table in one hand, plus the drill and it's 
boxing, and then a bag that had everything else meant that I couldn't do a small fancy doctor bag. 
I look more like a construction worker until I set up. [some kind of buzzing in the background 
here, maybe a cell phone is ringing on vibrate.] 
 
KC  1:26:53   
Have you told him about Sonny? [referencing JG's "Radical Repair Workshop" artwork]

JG  1:26:53   
No, not in an explicit way. Well, thank you so much for that impromptu concert. It's just been so 
long since anyone has played music in front of me because of the pandemic, it was really 
moving. So thank you for that. 
 
DW  1:27:07   
Well I'm sorry it wasn't better. 
 
JG  1:27:10   
It's just, it's just so nice to to hear.  
 
KC  1:27:13   
Yeah, what a real pleasure talking with you. I mean, I have never really played an instrument, 
and you know, I can sing along in the car or shower pretty well, but probably mostly tone deaf. 
So you did a really good job explaining a field I know very little about. Like, I can see the 
Doctor moniker working for all number of reasons. 
 
DW  1:27:41   
Thank you. Yeah. Thank you 
 
JG  1:27:42   
Thanks so much.
