INTRODUCTION
 
Ataturk School is a Turkish "Saturday" school in New York
 
City.
 Centrally located,  it serves the whole Turkish community
 
in upstate New York,  Connecticut,  the Bronx, Manhattan,  Queens
 
and Long Island,  and Brooklyn.
 The school is administered by
 
the American Turkish Women's League,  an organization bringing
 
together mostly middle class and elite Turkish women in the
 
New York metropolitan area who are interested in serving the
 
Turkish community.
 
This is a report on fieldwork undertaken at Ataturk
 
School during the final month of the school year,  May,  1982.
 
In it,  I will examine how Ataturk School contributes to the
 
formulation and maintenance of ethnic identity in the Turkish
 
community of the New York metropolitan area.
 After mention-
ing my relationship to the school  I will present a description
 
of Ataturk School,  outline a school day,  give a brief analysis
 
of the data presented,  and suggest further research.
 
1.
 Access to the field
  
I gained access to Ataturk School through a telephone
 
call to the Turkish Information Office,  where I fortuitously
 
contacted a former in-law of mine who put me in touch with
 
Mrs. Nermin Karcio lu,  the principal of the school.
 When I
 
proposed the project to Mrs.  Karcio lu over the telephone,
 
she appeared interested and told me that she would confer with
 
women at Women's League to be sure that they had no objection
 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
 
The fieldwork on which this report is based was undertaken
 
at the behest of the American Folkilfe Center,  the Library of
 
Congress,  as part of its Ethnic Heritage Schools project.
 
I want to thank Mrs.  Minevver Ozdil,  President of Turkish
 
American Women's League,  and Mrs. Nermin Karcio lu,  principal
 
of Ataturk School,  for making this study possible.
 Not only
 
did these two women extend Turkish hospitality to me, making
 
it possible for me to attend Ataturk School,  interviewing,
 
taping,  and taking pictures,  but they also extended every
 
cooperation,  offered ideas I have used in the report,  and
 
graciously gave me curriculum materials.
 I gratefully
 
acknowledge their help,  their intelligent comments and interest
 
in the project,  and regret any inconvenience my presence at the
 
school may have caused them.
 
I also wish to thank the parents,  students and teachers
 
of Ataturk School who extended their interest,  cooperation
 
and acceptance to me,  and who were eager to answer my ques-
tions so candidly.
 They remain unidentified in my report,
 
and mostly unnamed in my journal as a precaution against any
 
possible future misuse of these materials, but  I value each
 
and every one of them as a friend.
 They made this experience
 
not only a fruitful one, but also an enjoyable one for me.
 
It is my hope that this report reflects their enthusiasm and
 
hard work.

to my studying the school.
 She told me that I would be welcome
 
at a holiday celebration the following Saturday.
 At the 23
 
Nisan (April 23rd)  celebration which I attended,  Mrs.  Karcio lu
 
introduced me to the president of Women's League,  Mrs. MUnevver
 
Czdil, who indicated approval of my research,  and offered any
 
help she could give.
 I arranged to visit the school the
 
following Saturday when it would be in session.
 
DESCRIPTION OF ATATURK SCHOOL - 
The first  impression one gets of Ataturk School is that
 
it is a place full of life and exuberance.
 Before,  between,
 
and after classes,  children race and tumble amidst a cacoph-
onous din.
 (See photos 194116-4 #22,  -5 #35,  37,  38;
 
197561-2 #3,  6,  -1 #5.)
 Boys wrestle,  toss around each
 
other's hats or shoes or books, while girls wander about in
 
groups of two or three,  talking,  playing games like "London
 
Bridge" and drawing on blackboards.
 During classes the
 
demeanor is more decorous.
 Teachers expect the children to
 
uietly and copy the lessons from the board,  take dicta-
or listen to each other recite.
 
1.
 Space
  
Ataturk School is located in a central place in New York
 
City,  in space provided by the Turkish government.
 The school
 
is on the second floor of a large office building.
 Children
 
and their parents must travel to the school by bus,  train or
 
car.
 Most children are escorted to the school,  usually by
 
their mothers,  and a sorting out of children and parents
 
-3--
occurs in the lobby where children depart for the elevators
 
to the second floor and parents move to an adjacent waiting
 
room.
 Very small children may be escorted by their parents
 
directly to their classrooms.
 
The second floor of the building,  which is entirely
 
occupied by the school on Saturdays,  is a large space which
 
can be divided up into smaller ones with permanent moving
 
partitions and also temporary moveable ones.
 For the school's
 
purposes,  the permanent partitions are in place dividing the
 
space into a large center area,  one smaller area on each end,
 
and one small room in the middle space  (see diagram).
 The
 
room partitioned off on the extreme left as one comes out of
 
the elevators belongs to the first class,  which is the largest
 
class at the school,  numbering about 25 youngsters aged six
 
to eleven or twelve.
 It has an unmistakably Turkish fireplace
 
of the sort found in Turkish palaces (see pictures 197561-5
 
#0,  1,  5).
 The small room in the middle is occupied by the
 
nursery-kindergarten,  the central large space by the third
 
and fourth classes,  and the area on the ri ht  i
 r
n ni rrI
 
the second and fifth classes.
 
In the morning before 10:00 a.m.  when the classes start,
 
folding chairs for the children are carried into place, black-
boards are rolled to desired locations,  and a small temporary
 
partition is located between the areas occupied by the second
 
and fifth classes.
 These paraphernalia are supposed to be
 
moved by building personnel who are paid for their services
 
by the school,  but occasionally it is necessary for the
 
-4-
principal,  students or teachers to pitch in and set up the
 
school.
 At  the end of the day everything is put away,  the
 
chairs in a hail closet and the blackboards and temporary parti-
tion in a small room set aside for the Women's League, which
 
also houses lockers for the teachers,  principal and president
 
of Women's League,  and curriculum materials.
 For special
 
occasions,  the entire floor can be opened up and turned into
 
an auditorium,  as was done for the year-end ceremony.
 
2.
 Sponsor
  
Ataturk School is sponsored by the American-Turkish
 
Women's League,  an organization affiliated with the Federation
 
of Turkish-American Societies,  as far as I can tell the only
 
member association run primarily by and for women.
 The
 
League was formally registered in 1956 in Albany,  New York,
 
but was started informally by a woman educator as early as
 
1948-50.
 According to its current president,  the League has
 
several objectives:
 to foster ethnic awareness and knowledge
 
in American Turkish children,  to found Ataturk School to
 
achieve this purpose,  and to further friendship and love
 
between Turks and Americans  in the United States.
 The League
 
has currently over two hundred members,  but as in many organi-
zations,  the work of supporting and maintaining the school
 
â€¢nrtedly falls to about a dozen of them.
 
Women's League raises money to support the school budget
 
;
hich runs to about $10,000.00 per year,  selects teachers and
 
principal,  oversees the acquisition of curriculum materials
 
-0 -
from Turkey,  sets tuition fees and salaries for the school and
 
administers their collection and dispersion,  and plans and
 
organizes school functions such as the holiday celebrations.
 
Money is raised by charging entrance fees to some of these
 
functions,  selling food at some of them,  and holding purely
 
fund-raising events such as teas and balls.
 There are con-
flicting reports as to whether or not the Turkish government
 
subsidizes the school in any other way than by contributing
 
space.
 In any case,  Women's League is an organization of
 
Turks in America,  independent of the Turkish government,  and
 
it takes full responsibility for the existence of Ataturk
 
School.
 
3.
 History
  
Ataturk School was founded in 1973 by Women's League.
 In
 
the beginning it was housed at the Turkish consulate,  then at
 
the United Nations School where several ethnic groups had space
 
for their ethnic heritage schools.
 Teachers volunteered their
 
services in the early years,  and no rent was paid until the
 
school moved into the United Nations School.
 At that point
 
tuition was charged to meet the rent,  and this practice has
 
continued with each child paying a nominal $50.00 per year.
 
No one seems to have been happy at the United Nations School,
 
where space was inadequate.
 Finally,  about four years ago,
 
the school moved to its present location, where it is again
 
housed at the expense of the Turkish government.
 Administrators,
 
faculty and parents all expressed satisfaction with the current
 
-6-
location of the school.
 They feel that it is their own space,
 
that there is adequate provision for the classes and waiting
 
parents,  as well as for the equipment necessary for the school.
 
Having started off nine years ago with only one class,  the
 
school added a fifth class last year,  bringing the total to
 
six,  including nursery.
 There are nine teachers:
 the s
 
classroom teachers,  a music teacher,  a folklore  (folkdan
_
 
teacher,  and a religion teacher,  added this year.
 Ataturk
 
School now serves about ninety pupils aged four through fif-
teen.
 
4.
 Staff
  
Now,  as from the beginning,  teachers at Ataturk School
 
are professional educators from Turkey who happen to be living
 
in the United States.
 A great deal of stress is placed on the
 
qualifications of the teachers,  all of whom teach at the school
 
because of their concern for Turkish children and love of
 
teaching.
 The teachers are paid an honorarium of $25.00 per
 
week for their services, which is seen as merely meeting their
 
expenses.
 One of the things the school would like to do if it
 
had enough money would be to raise the pay of the teachers.
 
All of the classroom teachers at Ataturk School have teach-
ing certificates from Turkish institutions,  or are professional
 
educators.
 One spent his professional life in Turkey editing
 
and publishing textbooks.
 Another taught school in Turkey and
 
Germany before coming here.
 In addition,  the music teacher is
 
a man whose avocation has been performing Turkish music at
 
-I -
public functions for many years,  the folk dancing teacher has
 
danced in a prize-winning Turkish folk dancing troupe which
 
toured Europe,  and the religion teacher has two graduate
 
degrees from Istanbul University,  a certificate from the High
 
Institute of  Islam in Istanbul,  and works as a full-time
 
imam (priest) and school administrator for a Turkish communi
v
 
in Brooklyn.
 
Mrs.  Kai
L a uri
 eiiuui,
 
biology at the college level in Turkey,  and has a certificate
 
from Teachers'  College,  Columbia University.
 Mrs.  Ozdil,
 
president of Women's League and an administrator of the
 
school,  taught  for many years in a private school in Brooklyn,
 
and also served as its principal.
 
Ataturk School allows many different teaching styles.
 
The first grade teacher uses warmth,  touching,  and praise to
 
encourage the youngsters to behave well.
 (See pictures 196411-6
 
#24-35.)
 Good work is rewarded with red ribbons pinned to the
 
children's clothing and called to the attention of anyone
 
around who might be interested.
 The second and third grade
 
teachers are more formal in their approach to the classroom,
 
and are more stern.
 Both their classrooms are set up with
 
rows of seats facing a blackboard,  as opposed to a circle used
 
for the fourth class,  and arcs around the teacher's desk for
 
the fifth.
 The second and third class teachers use stern
 
voice tone,  scolding and an occasional ear tweak to spur the
 
children to settle down and do their work.
 The fourth and
 
fifth class teachers are more soft spoken,  but also use a
 
-8-
stern voice tone to guide the youngsters to good behavior and
 
good work.
 
5.
 Curriculum
  
The curriculum at Ataturk School is derived from materials
 
put out by the National Education Ministry in Turkey.
 Books
 
and pamphlets are published for the Ministry by one of the
 
large Turkish banks,  and are distributed throughout the
 
country.
 Ataturk School has access to these books,  and uses
 
them in its classes,  choosing the appropriate grade level for
 
each class.
 Pupils are required to pay $1.00 for each book
 
they take for the year,  and at the end of the year they can
 
return the books if they wish and get their money back.
 
Since Ataturk School has only a few hours per week in
 
which to make use of the materials, much is left out in the
 
lessons.
 No attempt is made to teach science and math,  for
 
instance.
 Emphasis is placed on Turkish language,  history,
 
social studies,  music and religion.
 Songs and poetry are
 
stressed in nursery-kindergarten,  reading and writing in first
 
grade,  and social studies and history in the higher grades.
 
All of these are taught in Turkish.
 I was  unable to obtain
 
lesson plans,  but was told that the teachers choose their
 
study materials at the beginning of the school year in con-
ference with the principal.
 Yearly,  monthly,  and weekly
 
lesson plans are made.
 I observed several lessons,  and these
 
are documented in tapes 1A,  lB and 3A and in my journal  (May 1,
 
1982;  May 8,  1982).
 
-9-
The curriculum materials are chosen with several goals in
 
mind.
 Many parents and teachers stress the importance of the
 
children knowing the Turkish language well,  and children have
 
the impression that this is the main purpose of the school.
 
The fostering of ethnic pride is also emphasized,  and to this
 
end lessons which stress the glories of Turkish history,  the
 
greatness of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,  the founder of modern
 
Turkey,  and the beauties of the Turkish homeland are chosen.
 
Providing a common fund of knowledge about the language,
 
country and its culture to act as a referent for Turkish
 
ethnicity is also acknowledged as a goal of the curriculum.
 
Sample songs and lesson materials are documented in the tapes
 
and journal.
 (See tapes 1A,  1B,  2B,  5A.)
 
6.
 Population
  
The population served by Ataturk School consists of first-
generation Turkish immigrant families living in the New York
 
metropolitan area,  and the Turkish consular staff here on
 
rotation.
 Some of the children have been born in the United
 
States,  some in Turkey.
 All have obviously Turkish personal
 
names.
 Children come from as far away as Connecticut,
 
Poughkeepsie,  New York,  and Stony Brook,  Long Island, but not
 
from New Jersey and points west.
 Many Turkish immigrants
 
represented in the school population are members of the
 
intelligentsia who came here as college students and stayed
 
to practice professions,  but workers and small entrepreneurs
 
are also present.
 The families whose members I interviewed
 
-10-
include several Ph.D.'s,  families where both the father and
 
the mother have professional careers,  families where the sole
 
wage earner is a mechanic, building superintendent,  engineer,
 
doctor and diplomat,  and families where both parents run a
 
small business such as a dry cleaning establishment,  restaurant
 
or tailor shop.
 
There are other Turkish schools in the Bronx,  New York,
 
Brooklyn,  New York,  and Queens,  New York, but some families
 
from each of these areas bring their children to Ataturk
 
School.
 The Brooklyn school serves a special constituency
 
of Crimean Turks who settled there after World War II,  and
 
have their own organizations.
 The Queens and Bronx schools
 
also apparently serve special sub-ethnic populations.
 Ataturk
 
School is in the dominant tradition of the modern Turkish
 
nation and does not appeal to any particular sub-ethnic group.
 
Parents bring their children here because they see themselves
 
as mainstream Turks, because of its central location,  and
 
because Ataturk School represents an opportunity to connect
 
with the American Turkish elite.
 
The families interviewed exhibit differences in their
 
commitment to living in America.
 No one interviewed admitted
 
that they never planned to return to Turkey,  and all had been
 
to Turkey within the last five to six years,  at least as
 
visitors.
 Some are in the United States with short-term goals
 
in mind,  such as completing an assignment from the Turkish
 
foreign ministry or educating a youngster.
 Others are raising
 
their families here because of favorable economic conditions,
 
-11-
but hope to return
 
families there are
 
settle in America,
 
to Turkey.
 Among the most highly educated
 
some who have made a conscious decision to
 
but when pressed,  even these don't rule
 
out retiring to Turkey eventually.
 In general,  my observa-
tions indicate that the most educated families are most
 
assimilated and most secure in their decision to remain in
 
America,  except  for those working in the diplomatic corps.
 
The least educated tend to remain more Turkish in their
 
language and behavior,  to view their stay in America as an
 
economic adaptation to difficult times,  and to anticipate
 
their eventual return "home."
 A Turkish-American colleague
 
of mine corroborated that  "all Turks are always going home."
 
I call this the "boxes in the closet syndrome"--whenever you
 
buy an appliance you save the box,  because some day it will
 
be packed up and sent to Turkey!
 
There is a difference between the children and their
 
parents over the issue of staying in America permanently.
 
Although many youngsters professed insecurity about their
 
future in this country, most indicated quite strongly that
 
they want to spend the rest of their lives here.
 No child
 
showed any reluctance to assimilate,  to speak English,  to
 
have American friends,  dress in American clothes and enjoy
 
American foods,  and this includes children of the consular
 
staff.
 Some children do show a reluctance to stress Turkish
 
behaviors,  including use of the Turkish language,  but none
 
seemed eager to forget about being Turkish altogether.
 Even
 
-12-
those most negative about Ataturk School told me that they
 
would teach their children about being Turkish.
 
THE SCHOOL DAY
 
1.
 Classes
  
A school day begins,  for some classes,  with a recited
 
motto shouted after the teacher while standing at attention.
 
The motto starts out "I'm Turkish,  upright and hardworking,"
 
and goes on to mention defending the young,  honoring the
 
elders,  loving one's people,  and uplifting one's nation.
 
For other classes there is a more subtle call to order.
 A
 
lesson is then announced and frequently written on the board
 
by the teacher,  to be copied by the pupils.
 Lessons might be
 
on "Turkish Language," "Life Knowledge"  (customs),  "Social
 
Studies," or "History."
 Pupils may be expected to listen to
 
further explication by the teacher,  read aloud before the
 
class or answer questions posed by the teacher.
 
There is a lunch break at 12:00 noon,  and most children
 
bring their lunch,  although some parents bring in pizzas at
 
lunchtime and have their children share with their classmates.
 
(See photos 196411-5 #2-4.)
 Although one teacher stays
 
upstairs in the class area on "lunch duty" no attempt is made
 
to enforce orderly behavior at this time,  and short of throw-
ing food or injuring someone,  most kinds of horsing around are
 
tolerated along with soaring noise levels.
 Some children go
 
downstairs to have lunch in the waiting room with their
 
parents.
 Some parents come upstairs to supervise the pizza
 
-13--
eating.
 Most of the lunches are American style sandwiches
 
and drinks.
 (See photos 196411-5 #5-10.)
 I didn't notice any
 
tendency for children to bring Turkish style picnic foods for
 
lunch.
 
When classes are called back into session,  lunch garbage
 
is packed away in overflowing wastebaskets and children resume
 
a quieter demeanor.
 Every other week the music teacher and
 
the religion teacher come and the school is divided in half,
 
the two teachers alternating their time with each half of the
 
school.
 Sometimes on the week when the teachers don't come,
 
the whole school is called to an assembly-like gathering where
 
the regular teachers teach Turkish songs.
 An example would be
 
when the teachers were teaching a song,  "My Mother," in prepa-
ration for Mother's Day.
 The song tells of an older child
 
longing to have mother hold him in her lap and sing lullabyes
 
again,  like she did when he was small.
 (See tape C1B,  Journal
 
5/1/82.)
 
At three o'clock school is let out and children drift
 
away,  except for those staying for the folkdance class.
 About
 
a dozen children seem to be involved in this,  and during the
 
weeks when I observed the school they were practicing for the
 
19th of May celebration,  which was to take place as a field
 
day in New Jersey.
 
2.
 Parents
  
While school is in session twenty or more mothers usually
 
gather in the waiting area off the lobby where benches and
 
-14--
chairs and a coffeepot are provided.
 Less than half a dozen
 
fathers may gather at the opposite end of the long room from
 
the mothers.
 The fathers sometimes engage in conversation,
 
sometimes read a newspaper,  or just sit quietly.
 The mothers
 
engage in lively conversation and gossip, making the occasion
 
into an important social event.
 For some this is the only
 
chance they have to meet regularly with other Turkish women,
 
certainly to sit with a whole group of them,  as is common for
 
women in Turkey to do.
 Sometimes a mother brings home-made
 
cakes for the gathering.
 Most of the women who sit in the
 
lobby are homemakers and my impression is that the core who
 
come most faithfully are wives of blue collar workers.
 How-
ever,  I have also spoken to wives of professional men who
 
like to visit with the other mothers,  at least occasionally.
 
I did not find any career women among the regularly sitting
 
mothers.
 
The talk,  which is in Turkish,  turns to homemaking skills
 
like cooking and sewing,  shopping,  ill health and fortune
 
among acquaintances,  problems of adaptation to American life
 
and events of the school.
 This is an important clearing house
 
for information concerning products available,  proprietors
 
worth patronizing,  housing,  vacations,  and coping with
 
American and Turkish institutions.
 This gathering also serves
 
as an ad hoc P.T.A.  for Ataturk School,  as the principal regu-
larly joins the mothers for some time each week,  discussing
 
school matters and contributions expected from parents,  like
 
preparing the children's outfits,  and food for special events.

FUNCTIONS OF ATATURK SCHOOL
 
The functions of Ataturk School are many,  manifest and
 
latent.
 They include socialization in Turkish identity for
 
the children,  enculturation in Turkish language and world view.
 
Turkish ethnic group formation,  and provision of a forum wher.
 
bi-cultural children can formulate their own value system.
 
1. 
Identity
  
Many reasons are given by parents,  teachers,  and adminis-
trators for their participation at Ataturk School.
 Underlying
 
all of the reasons is a burning concern that the children
 
-16-
-
acquire and retain a sense of Turkishness,  a sense of identity
 
and ethnic pride.
 All are willing to give their time and
 
energy for the rewards of hearing the children speak Turkish,
 
seeing them write Turkish and participate in Turkish events.
 
College educated parents show an awareness of "identity
 
crisis" and express concern that their children formulate a
 
sense of identity,  know "who they are."
 They feel Ataturk
 
School can provide this for their children.
 Less educated
 
parents show less interest in abstract identity,  and more
 
concern that the children continue in traditions that are
 
familiar to them,  that the youngsters not be cut off from
 
parents and their homeland by losing the language and culture.
 
One mother,  born in America and married to a Turkish-born man,
 
expressed a fear that if she did not expose her son to an
 
ethnic education he would one day accuse her of depriving him
 
of his birthright.
 
2.
 Language
  
Turkish language acquisition for the children seems to be
 
one of the primary goals of Ataturk School,  and all curriculum
 
materials are in Turkish exclusively.
 The only classroom where
 
English is frequently spoken by the teacher is the first class,
 
where there are children less familiar with Turkish.
 Even here,
 
an attempt is made to conduct most matters in Turkish.
 One
 
teacher eloquently expressed to me the need for the children
 
to be fluent in Turkish so that they would be able to feel at
 
home in Turkey.
 He likened Turkish children in America without
 
-17-
the Turkish language to nightingales in a gilded cage.
 No
 
matter how beautiful and rich the cage,  the inhabitant is
 
still not free.
 To be free  (to return to their homeland if
 
they wish) Turkish-American youngsters must have command of
 
the Turkish language and culture.
 
Attitudes toward use of the Turkish language vary with
 
education of the parents and the extent of their assimilation.
 
Parents involved in American activities such as a career ar
 
more likely to report speaking English to their children a
l
l
 
home.
 Since more fathers work outside the home than mothers,
 
there are more reports of fathers speaking English to the
 
children at home.
 One family,  in which both parents are
 
involved in American careers,  employs a Turkish housekeeper
 
who speaks only Turkish,  to care for the children.
 
College educated parents emphasize the general benefits
 
which accrue to language skill acquisition in business and
 
the academic world,  as part of their reason for sending their
 
children to Ataturk School.
 However,  since these parents are
 
also most concerned about assimilation themselves,  they most
 
often speak English to their children,  to "make sure the child
 
understands," to facilitate the child's adjustment with his
 
American peers,  or to perfect their own skills in English.
 
Wives of highly educated professionals complained most to me
 
about their inadequacy in English;  they speak English better
 
than the other mothers, but not as well as their husbands.
 
One blue collar mother reports speaking Turkish to her children
 
-18-
at home because her ethnic neighbors told her that if she
 
didn't her children would lose the language as theirs had.
 
She feels that she is sacrificing her own opportunity to learn
 
English better for the good of her children.
 
3.
 Group Formation
  
M
iinevver Ozdil,  president of the sponsoring organization,
 
has a more broad-reaching vision for the school.
 She sees it
 
not only as a language-teaching institution,  not only as a
 
link between Turkish-American children and their homeland,
 
but also as a fosterer of a Turkish ethnic presence in the
 
United States.
 She is aware of the small numbers of Turks
 
living in this country,  and is concerned that they be able to
 
unite and make their voice heard and respected.
 She expects
 
that creating Turkish-conscious youngsters who are educated
 
and aware will contribute to this cause.
 The children,  sh
 
says,  are taught that they are representatives of the Turkish
 
community in their public lives,  and they must be careful to
 
set a good example,  to be loving and fair to their fellows,  so
 
that others will know that the Turks are a loving and friendly
 
people.
 
4.
 Children's Values
  
The children,  as children in most ethnic schools,  profess
 
little interest in the issues of such burning importance to
 
their elders,  and most would rather be doing something else
 
on Saturday.
 Boys especially are eager to disclaim any inter-
est at all in their Turkish studies,  to assure me that they
 
-19-
are hostage to their parents and "made to come to this school."
 
Most children believe that they are at the school to learn
 
Turkish,  because their parents do not believe that they know
 
the language well enough.
 The children feel that they do know
 
the language,  that they get along well enough when they visit
 
Turkey,  and they don't see the need for learning all the
 
history and social studies,  singing and religion given at
 
the school.
 Many who feel unhappy about the school give as
 
their reason "boredom."
 Most also feel bored with their
 
public school education,  although some make distinctions
 
between the two.
 Several girls did feel free to tell me that
 
they enjoy Ataturk School,  they like learning Turkish better,
 
and find Turkish history interesting.
 
The children I spoke with have American friends where they
 
live and do not especially seek out Turks,  even when they are
 
in the same school,  unless their families carry on relation-
ships with these other Turks.
 Some of the children have
 
acquired Americanized nicknames.
 When asked if they share
 
their Turkish culture with their American friends,  more than
 
one child told me that their friends tease them when they act
 
or appear Turkish,  and that they want to pass as any other
 
American.
 Some play on softball or soccer teams,  take music
 
lessons,  or belong to a "Y" with their American friends.
 When
 
these activities conflict with attendance at Ataturk School,
 
sometimes attendance at the school is sacrificed,  as when one
 
girl told me that she had missed several Saturdays because of
 
softball.
 
-20-
When asked what they like best about Ataturk School,
 
many children give the answer ulunc h
?? or "fooling around with
 
my friends," which indicates that even for the disaffected the
 
school has its pleasures,  and these come from associating with
 
other Turkish-American youngsters in the same situation.
 
Since these children come from such scattered homes,  for some
 
this is the only regular opportunity to be among many Turks
 
gathering together,  to feel that they are not alone or weird,
 
to create a culture of shared Turkish-American experience.
 
-21-
PART II
 
CREATING ETHNICITY
 
It is clear that Ataturk School is engaged in creating
 
and maintaining ethnic identity for children of Turkish
 
parents residing in America,  either as permanent  immigrants,
 
during the family-raising part of the life-cycle,  or on a
 
tour of duty.
 There are two main aspects to this function:
 
(1) the sharing of a body of knowledge which Turks acknowledge
 
as their own,  and which can serve as a marker of Turkish iden-
tity,  and (2) the provision of social space where Turkishness
 
can be acted out among Turks,  where mannerisms and language
 
can be practiced and honed to a Turkish norm (or at least a
 
Turkish-American one),  and where sameness and solidarity can
 
be expressed among an appreciative audience.
 The end product
 
of both of these aspects is an ethnic group,  capable of func-
tioning as an interest group.
 This idea has been expressed
 
in scholarly literature by Anya Royce (1982,  pp.  29-33) and
 
from the lay perspective by Mrs.  Ozdil  (see P.  18 above).
 
ATATURK SCHOOL AS PURVEYOR OF KNOWLEDGE
 
1.
 Language
  
Nothing can establish social boundaries as quickly and
 
emphatically as a language barrier.
 The first moment I walked
 
into the school I encountered a group of women conversing in
 
Turkish and,  had I not known the language and greetings making
 
it possible for me to include myself in the group,  I would
 
Ataturk School are conducted
 
of banter that goes on among
 
sometimes in Turkish._
It is
 
i
ii
 
in Turkish,  with the exception
 
the children,  and even that  is
 
significant  that the children
 
are the ones who are supposed to be deficient  in Turkishness,
 
and who are therefore at the school  to be e
ii( ,i

Turkish language and culture.
 
Much of the curriculum at
 
teaching children vocabulary and grammatical use of the Turkish
 
language.
 This is done through ordinary conversation and read-
ing the language.
 I saw no evidence of vocabulary lists to
 
memorize.
 The language is not taught as a second language,
 
but as it  is taught  in Turkey to schoolchildren of comparable

school.
 Turkish two-cheek kissing was practiced by all the
 
teachers at the ceremony.
 (See pictures 197561-4 #4-17.)
 
Children are expected to be  familiar with these gestures,  and
 
are required to perform them in public as signs of their
 
enculturation in Turkish behavior.
 
Idiomatic expressions are also important in conversa-
tions about the most mundane things.
 For instance,  among
 
women,  there are proper expressions to use when discussing
 
illness or misfortune ("Oh my God!",  "Let it be past."),
 
growing children ("Praised be to God!"),  tasks being accom-
plished ("May God make it easy!",  "May God reward you!").
 
Although attention may not be drawn to these kinds of folk
 
expressions in formal lessons,  children are exposed to them
 
at Ataturk School in conversations among their mothers and
 
teachers,  and given an opportunity to try them out and be
 
corrected in their usage.
 
Language provides not only a vocabulary and idioms which
 
create a common medium in which those who know the code may
 
communicate,  but it also provides a world-view (Whorf).
 Since
 
this project gave me my first opportunity to translate Turkish
 
systematically,  I have spent many hours looking up words over
 
which I have complete command in Turkish,  but find the English
 
equivalent elusive.
 In fact,  there is no satisfactory English
 
equivalent for many Turkish concepts.
 By teaching Turkish as
 
a mother tongue,  and not as a second language,  thereby avoiding
 
much direct translation, Ataturk School operates within the
 
Turkish world-view,  and passes it on to the children.
 
-24-
2.
 Symbolism
  
In addition to being able to communicate in the Turkish
 
language, being Turkish involves being familiar with Turkish
 
history and symbols.
 Especially this includes knowledge of
 
the history of the Turkish Republic,  acknowledgment of Ataturk
 
as a culture hero,  and familiarity with the geography of
 
Turkey.
 Ataturk School provides its students with this body
 
of knowledge.
 
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,  the first president of modern
 
Turkey,  is the school's namesake and hero.
 The mothers'
 
waiting area is dominated by a mural depicting Ataturk's great
 
humanism and quoting his wise sayings.
 The holidays celebrated
 
throughout the school year are mostly founded by Ataturk.
 The
 
children recite his speeches,  sing songs glorifying his
 
achievements,  and listen to speeches on formal occasions
 
holding him up as a great man to be emulated and served.
 He
 
is depicted as a leader of the victorious Turks and founder
 
of the nation in the 19th of May speech being practiced by
 
one of the children for the 19th of May celebration.
 Recogni-
tion of the greatness of Ataturk is closely linked with
 
knowledge of the founding of the Turkish Republic,  and with
 
the establishment of nationalistic pride and self-respect for
 
the ordinary Turk, who was not highly esteemed during the
 
period of the Ottoman Empire,  and especially during its
 
decline toward the end of the nineteenth century.
 
As they are taught to respond to Ataturk as the symbol of
 
modern Turkey and the source of modern Turkish patriotism,  the
 
-25--
children at Ataturk School are also taught to respond to the
 
Turkish flag,  to sing the national anthem and other patriotic
 
songs like "To Be a Turk is the Greatest Honor," and to recog-
nize Turkish folk costumes and music.
 
3.
 Religion
  
Recently religion has been added as a subject at Ataturk
 
School.
 In Turkey,  to be Turkish means to be Muslim,  and when
 
someone has converted to Islam
 the saying goes,  "He became
 
a Turk."
 Although being Muslim is so closely associated with
 
being Turkish,  many modern educated Turks are secular and do
 
not practice religion.
 Mrs.  Karcio lu told me that parents
 
at Ataturk School wished to have religion taught in the school
 
because they are aware of the saliency of religion as a deter-
minant of identity in America.
 In other words religion, which
 
for some would not be stressed as an important element of iden-
tity in Turkey where nearly everyone is born into the same
 
religion,  becomes stressed in America where religion is often
 
a component of ethnic identity,  and sometimes even stands
 
alone as a label or designator of group affiliation,  e.g.,
 
Catholic,  Protestant or Jew.
 Some parents,  especially those
 
who are most educated and would have stressed religion least
 
in Turkey,  feel that their children are getting more of a
 
religious training here than they would have had in Turkey,
 
because of the inclusion of religion in the curriculum of
 
Ataturk School.
 (In Ataturk School,  as in Turkey,  religion
 
is an optional subject.)
 
-26-
Although there are parents at Ataturk School who carry
 
over their secularism to the point of celebrating Christmas
 
for their children as a secular holiday,  others take advan-
tage of the winter holiday season to impress their Turkish
 
identity on their children.
 One parent pointed out that her
 
child's exposure to Judaism as an acceptable alternative to
 
Christianity in America made it easier for her to present Islam
 
as still another alternative,  and the only appropriate one for
 
Turks like themselves to espouse.
 Whether or not they practice
 
Islam (there are some families at Ataturk School who attend
 
mosque and pray regularly),  children at the school are exposed
 
to a body of religious knowledge which reinforces their Turkish-
ness and differentiates them from other Americans.
 
ATATURK SCHOOL AS A SOCIAL CENTER
 
1.
 In-Gathering
  
Quite apart from the curriculum,  Ataturk School as a
 
center where Turks can gather and act Turkish,  is an important
 
source of Turkish identification.
 More than one mother let
 
on -that although the manifest purpose of bringing her child to
 
Ataturk School is to improve its knowledge of Turkish,  the
 
most compelling reason for coming is to socialize with the
 
other mothers.
 In a world in which one spends most of the
 
week coping with an unfamiliar language and customs,  it must
 
be a relief to have a place to go where one can relax and
 
just be what one was raised to be--a Turkish woman.
 
-27-
In-gathering is also very important  for the establishment
 
and perpetuation of group norms and values.
 A reference group
 
provides standards against which members measure their self-
worth and success.
 The mothers and children who gather regu-
larly at Ataturk School sort out acceptable and unacceptable
 
behaviors for group members on the basis of interactions in
 
which they participate.
 "Turkish" behaviors--the use of
 
Turkish language,  gestures,  greetings,  etc.,  are highly
 
rewarded, while un-Turkish behaviors--refusing to sit and
 
visit,  use of English,  etc.,  are either sharply criticized,
 
or ignored.
 I can attest to the psychological pleasure
 
attending "right" behavior on the basis of my own acceptance
 
by the group because I could speak Turkish,  and also the dis-
pleasure associated with non-acceptance or criticism,  since
 
there was some suspicion and criticism due to my being a
 
researcher,  and not filling the role
 
just another mother.
 Career mothers
 
not only because it consumes so much
 
they do not live up to the standards
 
womanhood that are manifested there.
 
expectations of being
 
may avoid the gathering
 
time,  but also because
 
of traditional Turkish
 
If so,  the absence of
 
career mothers is an excellent example of the power of
 
in-gathering to set group standards a
id eliminate non-conforming
 
C
 
2
â€¢ 
Group Unity
  
Besides providing a scene where Turkish in-group behavior
 
be honed and developed for Turkish-Americans,  Ataturk
 
-28-
School provides a focus for Turks in the Metropolitan area,
 
who are otherwise divided in their loyalties by socio-economic
 
interests,  sub-ethnic interests,  and commitment to assimilation
 
in the United States.
 One father pointed out that although the
 
Turkish-American community has become fragmented during the
 
past few years by the proliferation of associations formed by
 
Turkish interest groups  (e.g.,  American Turkish Islamic and
 
Cultural Center,  Turkish Cultural Alliance,  Kibris Turkune
 
Yardim Ocag (Association for the Aid of Cypriot Turks),
 
American Association of Crimean Turks,  Anadolu Club,  Inc.,
 
Azerbaijan Society of America,  Turkish American Neuropsychia-
Turkish American Scientists and Engineers,
 
many of these groups support Ataturk School.
 
c
hildren at the school are thus exposed to a cross section of
 
urkish society in the United States.
 Agreement by members of
 
many groups to submit their children to a single curriculum
 
means that there is a common denominator of Turkishness shared
 
by all,  and this has not been overcome by tendencies toward
 
divisiveness within the Turkish community.
 
3.
 Establishment of Turkish-Americanness
  
For the children,  Ataturk School is the one place where
 
they experience a large number of Turks congregating in a
 
limited space on a regular basis.
 It may be the one place
 
for some of them,  outside the home,  where their Turkish
 
identity is salient,  and they get a chance to practice it.
 
The inclusion of the children of consular staff,  or  Turkish
 
-29-
Turks'  (as opposed
 
further emphasizes
 
and brings out the
 
to "American Turks")  in the student body,
 
that this is a school for Turkish children,
 
commonality between the children born in
 
America and their Turkish brethren.
 
Of greater significance for the children,  however,  Ataturk
 
School is not only a place to learn Turkishness,  but also an
 
arena where they can act out the tensions involved in being
 
bi-cultural.
 Many children spend most of the week,  at least
 
in public,  ignoring or even denying their differences from
 
other American children.
 Several told me that there is no
 
opportunity at their public schools to share aspects of their
 
ethnic heritage with other children,  and several boys assured
 
me that their American friends teased them mercilessly if they
 
let slip a Turkish-ism in their behavior.
 Some have American
 
nicknames to mask their Turkish names.
 Yet these very same
 
children will fight,  if necessary,  to protect the good name
 
of Turks.
 
The tension involved in being bi-cultural is partly acted
 
out in the display of dislike of Ataturk School by many of
 
the children.
 The children tell me that they are "Turkish
 
enough," and have no use for the enculturation they experience
 
at the school.
 They are highly sensitive about their Turkish-
ness,  and do not enjoy having it "rubbed in."
 One boy provided
 
a clue to the noisy negative feelings expressed by the children
 
by telling me that he would really like to go to a Turkish
 
school in Turkey,  but that his parents told him that it is too
 
expensive.
 Like my own bi-cultural children,  he seems to be
 
-30-
saying that he would like to be all-Turkish in Turkey,  or
 
all-American in America,  but that being both is a strain.
 
After trying all week to be just like any other American kid,
 
it must be difficult for the youngsters to "turn on" Turkish
 
on Saturdays.
 However,  the one adult  I interviewed who could
 
look back on such an experience herself says that she appre-
ciated it,  and is providing her child with the same experience.
 
Perhaps one of the greatest services Ataturk School provides
 
to the children is an opportunity to vent their negative feel-
ings to each other in a safe environment.
 These feelings,
 
which would be anti-Turkish if shared with American friends,
 
or Turkish parents,  become part of the culture of Turkish-
Americanism.
 Ataturk School is wise to provide the students
 
with a relatively unsupervised lunch period where the children
 
can discharge the tensions they feel in a situation where
 
mutual support and understanding is possible and they are
 
protected from the disapproval of adult authority figures.
 
I  one of the manifest functions of Ataturk School is
 
u
a1ize children living in America as Turks,  one of the
 
Lmportant latent functions is to provide an organized vehicle
 
:or the formulation of not a Turkish,  but a Turkish-American
 
culture.
 Americanisms in the children's dress (bluejeans and
 
sneakers for many),  food (pizza),  use of the Turkish language
 
("I ate breakfast" instead of "I did or made breakfast" which
 
is idiomatic) are readily accepted.
 Children are provided
 
with unstructured time to share their own values and experiences
 
The formal structure of the school is dedicated to the use of
 
-31-
strictly Turkish curricula,  but the informal structure can
 
not help but model a blend of Turkish and American culture.
 
FUTURE RESEARCH POSSIBILITIES
 
This brief study has proven so fruitful that it is hard
 
to begin to list the areas of research suggested by the data
 
collected.
 
1.
 Turkish Ethnic Heritage Schools in the New York
  
Metropolitan Area
  
During the course of the research,  several Turkish
 
ethnic heritage schools in the New York Metropolitan area
 
were brought to my attention:
 Inonu School in the Bronx,  a
 
school run by Cypriot Turks in Queens,  which may now be
 
defunct or serving less than a dozen children,  Ismail
 
Gaspirali Bey School in Brooklyn run by Crimean Turks,  a
 
religious school run at Fatih Mosque in Brooklyn,  Karacay
 
School in Paterson,  New Jersey.
 Unlike Ataturk School,  all
 
of these are community schools,  located in the neighborhood
 
which they serve.
 Ismail Gaspirali Bey School serves a
 
community of Crimean Turks who have lived in Brooklyn since
 
the end of World War II and thus are now into the second and
 
third generation.
 It would be interesting to compare the
 
curricula and management of these other schools,  or any one
 
of them, with Ataturk School.
 It would also be useful to
 
examine whether the stresses on the children observed at
 
Ataturk School are any different from those observed when the
 
child lives in a Turkish-American community.
 
-32-
2.
 Role and Status Differentiation in the Turkish-
American Community
  
Different status groups within the Turkish community,
 
including socio-economic groups and sex groups,  display
 
different values and behaviors at Ataturk School.
 Because
 
of the limitations of this research,  it has not been possible
 
to get any quantifiable data on these differences,  nor to
 
derive hypotheses as to why they exist.
 From the perspective
 
of this study,  mothers are more involved than fathers in ethnic
 
heritage enculturation,  but intensive interviews with families
 
would be necessary to expose the different roles of family
 
members and to reveal the salient variables,  for instance,
 
presence of a grandparent,  frequency of visits to Turkey,
 
parents'  occupation,  neighborhood influences,  etc.
 
More work needs to be done on the nature of migration
 
and assimilation.
 It would be helpful to locate Turks who
 
do not send their children to an ethnic school,  and to compare
 
their values,  goals,  socio-economic background and reasons for
 
migrating with those of Turks sending children to such schools.
 
3.
 Stress
  
Having raised two bi-cultural children myself,  I am aware
 
of the stress such children undergo.
 Research is required on
 
the role of bi-culturalism in personality development.
 Analysis
 
of the strategies children employ to cope with conflicting value
 
systems and demands on their time and behavior could help in
 
formulating curricula in both public and ethnic heritage schools.
 
-33-
If we understood more about how children adjust to conflict and
 
formulate ethnic identity,  such curricula could be designed to
 
minimize stress and maximize the utilization of cultural
 
resources in multi-ethnic neighborhoods.
 
Although children are powerless to determine their parents'
 
choice of domicile,  they must nevertheless deal with the con-
sequences of the parental choice.
 One child at Ataturk School
 
told me,  "You never know what is going to happen until it is
 
happening."
 This child must be prepared for anything,  to be
 
Turkish,  American,  or Turkish-American,  as the situation
 
demands.
 Research is required to assess the costs or benefits
 
of this kind of uncertainty in character formation of bi-cultural
 
youngsters.
 
CONCLUSION
 
My conclusion is brief.
 There are many children in the
 
United States today studying in ethnic heritage schools.
 
Some,  like the Turks of Ataturk School, may have the option
 
of going "home" someday,  and some don't.
 Some,  like the Turks
 
of this study, may be first generation Americans,  and others
 
may be second,  third,  or even fourth generation Americans.
 
All are being taught that roots are valuable,  that although
 
America may be a great place to live it is important to have
 
an identity and heritage.
 Our understanding of why this is
 
important is incomplete.
 We have psychological,  sociological,
 
materialistic and other theories about how and why people form
 
bounded groups,  but much work still needs to be done.
 I hope
 
-34-
that this brief ethnography of Ataturk School in New York
 
contributes to the bank of knowledge we have concerning
 
ethnic identity formation,  and that it may be used in some
 
way for the benefit of those laboring with great devotion
 
to pass on a valued heritage to the young.

 Sponsor
  
Ataturk School is sponsored by the American-Turkish
 
V
omen's League,  an organization affiliated with the Federation
 
of Turkish-American Societies,  as far as I can tell the only
 
member association run
 
primarily by and for women.
 Th e 
League was formally registered in 1956 in Albany,  New York,
 
but was started informally by a woman educator as early as
 
1948-50.
 According to its current president,  the League has
 
several objectives:
 to foster ethnic awareness and knowledge
 
in American Turkish children,  to found Ataturk School to
 
achieve this purpose,  and to further friendship and love
 
between Turks and Americans in the United States.
 The League
 
has currently over two hundred members,  but as in many organi-
zations,  the work of supporting and maintaining the school
 
reportedly falls to about a dozen of them.
 
women's League raises money to support the school budget
 
which runs to about $10,000.00 per year,  selects teachers and
 
a
 principal,  oversees the acauisitjon of curriculum materials
 
Â±r cm Turkey.  sets tuition fees and salaries for the school and
 
administers their oc1.ec:ion and d spe sion.  and alans and
 
organizes school functions such as the holiday celebrations.
 
Money is raised by charging entrance fees to some of these
 
functions,  selling food at some of them,  and holding purely
 
fund-raising events such as teas and balls.
 There are con-
flicting reports as to whether or not the Turkish government
 
subsidizes the school in any other way than by contributing
 
space.
 In any case,  Women's League is an organization of
 
Turks in America,  independent of the Turkish government,  and
 
it takes full responsibility for the existence of Ataturk
 
School.

 History
  
Ataturk School was founded in 1973 by  Women's League.
 In
 
the beginning it was housed at the Turkish consulate,  then at
 
the United Nations School where several ethnic groups had space
 
for their ethnic heritage schools.
 Teachers volunteered their
 
services in the early years,  and no rent was paid until the
 
schoQl moved into the United Nations School.
 At that point
 
tuition was charged to meet the rent,  and this practice has
 
continued with each child paying a nominal $50.00 per year.
 
No one seems to have been happy at the United Nations School,
 
where space was inadequate.
 Finally,  about four years ago,
 
the school moved to its present location,  where it  is again
 
housed at the expense of the Turkish government.
 A d
ministrators,
 
faculty and parents all expressed satisfaction with the current
 
-
6-
location C  
f
 the school.
 They feel that  it is their own space,
 
:cc: there is adeouate provision for the classes and waiting
 
rarec:s,  as well as for the equipment necessary for the school.
 
:aving started off nine years ago with only one class,  the
 
school added a fifth class last year, bringing the total to
 
six,  including
.
, nursery.
 There are nine teachers:
 the six
 
classroom teachers,  a music teacher,  a folklore (folkdancing)
 
teacher,  and a religion teacher,  added this year.
 Ataturk
 
School now serves about ninety pupils aged four through fif-
teen.
 
4
 Staff
  
Now,  as from the beginning,  teachers at Ataturk School
 
are professional educators from Turkey who happen to be living
 
in the United States.
 A great deal of stress is placed on the
 
qualifications of the teachers,  all of whom teach at the school
 
because of their concern for Turkish children and love of
 
teaching.
 The teachers are paid an honorarium of $25.00 per
 
week for their services, which is seen as merely meeting their
 
expe ses.
 One of the things the school would like to do if it
 
had enough money would be to raise the pay of the teachers.
 
All of the classroom teachers at Ataturk School have teach-
ing certificates from Turkish institutions, or are professional
 
educators.
 One spent his professional life in Turkey editing
 
and publishing textbooks.
 Another taught school in Turkey and
 
Germany before co ing here.
 In addition,  the music teacher is
 
a man whose avocation has been performing Turkish music at

fegrees from Istanbul University,  a certificate from the High

rs.  Karcio lu,  the principal of Ataturk School,  taught
 
biology at the college level in Turkey,  and has a certi f
icate
 
from Teachers'  College,  Columbia University.
 Mrs.  Ozdil,
 
resident of Women's League and an administrator of the
 
school,  taught for many years in a private school in Brooklyn,
 
and also served as its principal.
 
Ataturk School allows many different teaching styles.
 
The first grade teacher uses warmth,  touching,  and praise to
 
encourage the youngsters to behave well.
 
Good work is rewarded with red ribbons pinned to the
 
children's clothing and called to the attention of anyone
 
,
-round who might be interested.
 The second and third grade
 
eachers are mcre formal in their approach to the classroom,
 
nd are more stern.
 Both their classrooms are set up with
 
-
 ows of seats facing a blackboard,  as c pcsed to a circle used
 
for the fourth class,  and arcs around the teacher's desk for
 
the fifth.
 The second and third class teachers use stern
 
voice tone,  scolding and an occasional ear tweak to spur the
 
children to settle down and do their work.
 The fourth and
 
fifth class teachers are more soft spoken.  but also use a
 
I
 
s
:ern vo:oe tone to guide the youngsters to good behavior and

 f
looks are

are put out by one of the iar e Turkish banks.
 Atatur'  sc: oo1
 
has access to these books and magazines, and uses them in it s 
cLasses,  choosing the appropriate g7ade level for each class.
 
Pupils are required to pay $1.00 for each book they take for
 
the year, and at the end of the year they can return the books
 
If they wish and  zet their money back.
 
Since Ataturk School has onLy a-Few nours per wee
 an
 
which to make use of the materials, much is left out in the
 
lessons.
 No attempt is made to teach science and math,  for
 
instance.
 Emphasis is placed on Turkish language,  history,
 
social studies, music and religion.
 Songs and poetry are
 
stressed in nursery-kindergarten,  reading and writing in first
 
grade.  and social studies and history in the higher grades.
 
All of these are taught in Turkish.
 I was  unable to obtain
 
lesson plans,  but was told that the teachers choose their
 
study materials at the beginning of the school year in con-
ference with the principal.
 Yearly, monthlv,  and weekly
 
lesson plans are made.

fostering of ethnic pride is also emphasized,  and to this
 
end lessons which stress the glories of Turkish history,  the
 
:rea:ness of :us afa Kemal Ataturk,  the founder of moder n 
Turkey,  and the beauties of the Turkish homeland are chosen.
 
Providing a common fund of knowledge about the language,

nulation served by Ataturk School consists of first-
:
eneration Turkish immigrant families living in the New York
 
nolitan area,  and the Turkish consular
, staff here on
 
7
 
ion.
 Some of the children have been born in the United
 
:ates,  some in Turkey.
 All have obviously Turkish personal
 
names.
 Children come from as far away as Connecticut,
 
?
zh:
-:eepsie.  New York,  and Stony Brook,  Long Island, but not
 
from New Jersey and points west.
 Many Turkish immigrants
 
re resented in the school population are members of the
 
intelligentsia who came here as college students and stayed
 
to  tractice professions,  but workers and small entrepreneurs
 
are also present.
 The families whose members I interviewed
 
-
-
include several Ph .
D.  s
,  families where both the father and
 
the mD:her have orofessional  careers,  families where the ecle
 
ware earner is a mechanic, building superintendent,  engineer.
 
doctor and diplomat,  and families where both parents run a
 
small business such as a dry cleaning establishment,  restaurant
 
or tailor shop.
 
There are other Turkish schools in the Bronx.  -
Nev- York
 
Brooklyn,  New York,  and Queens, New York, but some families
 
from each of these areas bring Â±heir children to Ataturk
 
School.
 The Brooklyn school serves a special constituency
 
of Crimean Turks who settled there after World War II,  and
 
have their own organizations.
 The Queens and Bronx schools
 
also apparently serve special sub-ethnic populations.
 Ataturk
 
School is in the dominant tradition of the modern Turkish
 
nation and does not appeal to any particular sub-ethnic group.
 
Parents bring their children here because they see themselves
 
as mainstream Turks, because of its central location,  and
 
because Ataturk School represents an opportunity to connect
 
with the American Turkish elite.
 
The families interviewed exhibit differences in their
 
commitment to living in America.
 No one interviewed admitted
 
that they never planned to return to Turkey,  and all had been
 
to Turkey within the last five to six years,  at least as
 
visitors.
 Some are in the United States with short-term goals
 
in mind,  such as completing an assignment from the Turkish
 
foreign ministry  jr educating a youngster.
 Others are raising
 
their f a
milies here because of favorable economic conditions,
 
-10-
hone to return to Tur e::.
 Among the most highly educated
 
families there are some who have made a conscious decision to
 
settle in America,  but when pressed,  even these don't rule
 
out retiring to Turkey eventually.
 In general, my observa-
tions indicate that the most educated families are most
 
assimilated and most secure in their decision to remain in
 
America,  except for those working in the diplomatic corps.
 
The least educated tend to remain more Turkish in their
 
language and behavior,  to view their stay in America as an
 
economic adaptation to difficult times,  and to anticipate
 
their eventual return "home."
 They have the "boxes in t?ie c1ot
 r
rJ
 
sy ndrome" -
-
 whenever they purchase an appliance they save the
 
box,  because some day i
t will be packed up and sent to Turkey!
 
There is a difference between the children and their
 
parents over the issue of staying in America permanently.
 
Although many youngsters professed insecurity about their
 
future in this country, most indicated quite strongly that
 
they want to spend the rest of their lives here.
 No child
 
showed any reluctance to assimilate,  to speak English,  to
 
have American friends,  dress in American clothes and enjoy
 
American foods,  and this includes children of the consular
 
staff.
 Some children do show a reluctance to stress Turkish
 
behaviors,  including use of the Turkish language,  but none
 
seemed eager to forget about being Turkish altogether.
 Even
 
those most nega::ve about Ataturk School told me that they
 
wou i teach their children about being Turkish.
 
SCHOOL DAY
 
1
.
 Classes  
A school day begins,  for some classes, with a recited
 
motto shouted after the teacher while standing at attention.
 
The motto starts out "I'm Turkish,  upright and hardworking,'
 
and goes on to mention defending the young,  honoring the
 
elders,  loving one's people,  and uplifting one's nation.
 
For other classes there is a more subtle call to order.
 A
 
lesson is then announced and frequently written on the board
 
by the teacher,  to be copied by the pupils.
 Lessons might be
 
on "Turkish Language," 'Life Knowledge"  (customs),  "Social
 
Studies," or "History."  Pupils may be expected to listen to
 
further explication by the teacher,  read aloud before the
 
class or answer questions posed by the teacher.
 
There is a lunch break at 12:00 noon,  and most children
 
bring their lunch,  although some parents bring in pizzas at
 
lunchtime and have their children share with their classma -tes.
 
 
 Although one teacher stays
 
upstairs in the class area on  "lunch duty" no attempt is made
 
to enforce orderly behavior at this time,  and short of throw-
ing food or injuring someone, most kinds of horsing around are
 
tolerated along with soaring noise levels.
 Some children go
 
downstairs to have lunch in the waiting room with their parents.
 
c:  the lunches are American StyiC  sar
idc;iohes
 
and dr:nks.'
 
I didn't notice any
 
icr c i dren to bring Turkish style picnic foods for
 
her classes are called back into session,  lunch garbage
 
s â€¢
cacked away- in overflowing wastebaskets and children resume
 
a cuieter demeanor.
 Every other week the music teacher and
 
the religion teacher come and the school is divided in half,
 
the two teachers alternating their time with each half of the
 
school.
 Sometimes on the week when the teachers don't come,
 
the whole school is called to an assembly-like gathering where
 
the regular teachers teach Turkish songs.
 An example would be
 
when the teachers were teaching a song,  "My Mother," in prepa-
ration for :cther's Day.
 The song tells of an older child
 
longing to have mother hold him in her lap and sing lullabyes
 
again,  like she did when he was small. Â° 
A: three o'clock school is let out and children drift
 
away,  except for those staying for the folkdance class.
 About
 
a dozen children seem to be involved in this,  and during the
 
.
ee:s when I observed the school they were practicing for the
 
19th
 
of
 av celebration, which was to take place as a field
 
in New Jersey.
 
\hi1e school is in session twenty or more mothers usually
 
gather in the waiting area off the lobby where benches and
 
cza rs and a coffeepot are provided.
 Less than half a dozen
 
may gather at the Opposite end of the long room from
 
mothers.
 
I
'he fathers sometimes engage in conversation,
 
s:m :imeS read a newspaper,  or just sit quietly.
 The mothers
 
engage in lively conversation and gossip, making the occasion
 
into an important social event.
 For some this is the only
 
chance they have to meet regularly with other Turkish women.
 
certainly to sit with a whole group of them,  as is common  for
 
women in Turkey to do.
 Sometimes a mother brings home-made
 
cakes for the gathering.
 Most of the women who sit in the
 
lobby are homemakers and my impression is that the core who
 
come most faithfully are wives of blue collar workers.
 How-
ever,  I have also spoken to wives of professional men who
 
like to visit with the other mothers,  at least occasionally.
 
I did not find any career women among the regularly sitting
 
mothers.
 
The talk,  which is in Turkish,  turns to homemaking skills
 
like cooking and sewing,  shopping,  ill health and fortune
 
among acquaintances, problems of adaptation to American lii
 
and events of the school.
 This is  an important clearing house
 
for information concerning products available, proprietors
 
worth patronizing,  housing,  vacations,  and coping with
 
American and Turkish institutions.
 This gathering also serves
 
as an ad hoc P.T.A.  for Ataturk School,  as the principal regu-
larly joins the mothers for some time each week,  discussing
 
school matters ar.,
..  contributions expected from parents,  like
 
preparing the children's outfits,  and food for special  events.

 There is some Turkish-style kissing on both

 On the final day of
 
classes one of the younger girls went around and kissed the
 
cheeks and hands of some of the "Aunts"  (as Turkish children
 
are taught to address adult women) in a formal and polite
 
farewell.
 This behavior was highly praised and appreciated,
 
both by the recipients and by the mother of the girl,  who

FU:cCTIO:;S 01 ATATU?K SCHOOL
 
The functions of Ataturk School are many, manifest and
 
latent.
 They include socialization in Turkish ide nt it y for  
the children,  enculturation in Turkish language and world view.
 
Thrkish ethnic group formation,  and provision of a forum where
 
72
 
'
.
'any reasons are given by parents,  teachers,  and adminis-
trators for their participa j
 at Ata -curk School.
 Underlying
 
all 0
 f the reasons is a burning concern that the children
 
acquire and retain a sense of Turkishness,  a sense of identity
 
C:
 ic nr ce
 -
 are \a
ng to gi\e their time and
 
ener;
- icr the rewards oÂ± hearing the children spe ak Tur ki sh, 
seeing them write Turkish and participate in Turkish events.
 
College educated parents show an awareness of "identity
 
crisis" and express concern that their children formulate a
 
sense of identity,  know "who they are."  They feel Ataturk
 
School can provide this for their children.
 Less educated
 
parents show less interest in abstract identity,  and more
 
concern that the children continue in traditions that are
 
familiar to them,  that the youngsters not be cut off from
 
parents and their homeland by losing the language and culture.
 
One mother, born in America and married to a Turkish-born man,
 
expressed a fear that if she did not expose her son to an
 
ethnic education he would one day accuse her of depriving him
 
of his birthright.
 
2.
 Language
  
Turkish language acquisition for the children seems to be
 
one o  the primary goals oÂ± Ataturk School,  and all curriculum
,
 
materials are in Turkish exclusively.
 The only classroom where
 
English is frecuentiv spoken by the teacher is the first class,
 
where there are children less familiar with Turkish.
 Even here,
 
an attempt is made to conduct most matters in Turkish.
 One
 
teacher eloquently expressed to me the need for the children
 
to be fluent in Turkish so that they would be able to feel at
 
home in Turkey.
 He likened Turkish children in America without
 
:urkish language to nightingales in a gilded cage.
 xc
 
nc w
eau::: uL  anc  rtc h the  cage,  the inhabitant  is
 
o be free  (to return to their homeland if
 
c
v w-i
sh) Turkish-American youngsters must have command of
 
the Turkish language and culture.
 
:tizudes toward use of the Turkish language vary with
 
oa:icn of the parents and the extent of their assimilation.
 
Parents involved in American activities such as a career are
 
more likely to report speaking ]English to their children at
 
home.
 Since more fathers work outside the home than mothers,
 
there are more reports of fathers speaking English to the
 
children at home.
 One family,  in which both parents are
 
involved in American careers,  employs a Turkish housekeeper
 
who speaks only Turkish,  to care for the children.
 
Cc lege educated parents emphasize the general benefits
 
which accrue to language skill acquisition in business and
 
the academic world,  as part of their reason for sending their
 
children to Ataturk School.
 However,  sincd these parents are
 
also most concerned about assimilation themselves,  they most
 
often speak English to their children,  to "make sure the chil
 
crderstands,'  to facilitate the child's adjustment with his
 
American peers,  or to perfect their own skills in English.
 
wives of highly educated professionals complained most to me
 
about their inadequacy in English;  they speak English better
 
than  the other mothers, but not as well as their husbands.
 
One blue collar mother reports speaking Turkish to her children
 
aL home because her ethnic neighbors told h r that  if sh
 
her children would lose the language as theirs had.
 
ide feels that she is sacrificing her ov
.n opportunity to learn
 
English better for the good of her children.

.
 Group Formation
  
Ã¼nevver Ozdil, president of the sPonsoring organization,
 
has a more broad-reaching vision for the school.
 She sees it
 
not only as a language-teaching institution  not only as a
 
link between Turkish-American children and their homeland,
 
but also as a fosterer of a Turkish ethnic presence in the
 
United States.
 She is aware of the small numbers of Turks
 
living in this country,  and is concerned that they be able to
 
unite and make their voice heard and respected.
 She expects
 
that creating Turkish-conscious youngsters who are educated
 
and aware will contribute to this cause.

 Children's Values
  
The children,  as children in most ethnic schools,  profess
 
little interest in the issues of such burning importance to
 
their elders,  and most would rather be doing something else
 
on Saturday.
 Bc- 5 especially are eager to disclaim any inter-
est at all in their Turkish studies,  to assure me that they
 
- Ia -
hcs:aze to :ne:r naren:s and  made to come to this school.
 
h:s: chilirer
. believe that they are at the school to learn
 
because :heir parents do not believe that they know
 
the language well enough.
 The children feel that  they do know
 
the
 anguage,  that they get along well enough when they visit
 
Turke - . and they don't see the need for learning all the
 
histor- - and social studies,  singing and religion given at
 
the school.
 Many who feel unhappy about the school give as
 
their reason "boredom."  Most also feel bored with their
 
public school education,  although some make distinctions
 
between the two.
 Several girls did feel free to tell me that
 
they enjoy Ataturk School,  they like learning Turkish better,
 
and find Turkish history interesting.
 
The children I spoke with have American friends where they
 
live and dc not especially seek out Turks, even when they are
 
in the same school,  unless their families carry on relation-
ships with these other Turks.
 Some of the children have
 
acquired Americanized nicknames.
 When asked if they share
 
their Turkish culture with their American friends, more than
 
one child told me that their friends tease them when they act
 
r a
ear Turkish,  and that they want to pass as any other
 
American.
 Some play on softball or soccer teams,  take music
 
lessons,  or belong to a "Y" with their American friends.
 When
 
these activities conflict with attendance at Ataturk School,
 
sometimes attendance at the school is sacrificed,  as when one
 
girl told me that she had missed several Saturdays because of
 
softball.

they Ii:e best about
 taturk School
 
children give the answer "lunch'  or "fooling around woth
 
which indicates that even for the disaffected the
 
school has its pleasures,  and these come from associating with
 
other Turkish_Amer can youngsters in the same situation.
 
Since these C
1dren come from such scattered homes,  for some
 
this is the only regular opportunity to be among many Turks
 
gathering together,  to feel that they are not alone or weird,
 
to create a culture of shared Turkish-American experience.
 
I: is clear that Ataturk School is engaged in creating
 
and ma ntain ng ethnic identity for children of Turkish
 
parents residing in America,  either as permanent  immigr ::i .
 
during the family-raising part of the life-cycle,  or on
 
tour of duty.
 There are two main aspects to this functic.
 
(
1) the sharing of a body of knowledge which Turks acknowledge
 
as their own,  and which can serve as a marker of Turkish iden-
tity,  and (2) the provision of social space where Turkishness
 
can be acted out
 
can be practiced
 
Turkish-American
 
among Turks,  where mannerisms and language
 
and honed to a Turkish norm (or at least a
 
one),  and where sameness and solidarity can
 
be expressed among an appreciative audience.
 The end product
 
of both of these aspects is an ethnic group,  capable of func-
tioning as an interest group.
 This idea has been expressed
 
in scholarly literature by Anya Royce'

ATATURK SCHOOL AS PURVEYOR OF KNOWLEDGE

 Language
  
Nothing can establish social boundaries as quickly and
 
emphatically as a :
1an' ua e barrier.
 Almost all transactions that
 
occur at Ataturk school are conducted  in Turkish, with the ex-
ceptirn of banter that goes on among the c
' ildren,  and even that
 
is sometimes in Tur i.sh.

teaching children vocabulary and grammatical use of the Turkish
 
language.
 This is done through ordinary conversation and read-
ing the language.
 saw no evidence of vocabulary lists to
 
memorize.
 The language is not taught as a second language,
 
but as it is taug
ht in Turkey
 to Schoolchildren of comparable
 
age.
 
Although lessons are dedicated to formal use of the lan-
gua e,  children also informally pick up proper use of language
 
in social situations
 Turks engage in a whole range of polite
 
behaviors which are unfamiliar to Americans.
 Greeting
 
behaviors,  including cheek and hand kissing along with appro-
priate verbal expressions,  are very important
 These behaviors
 
are included in the formal curriculum,  as when the religion
 
teacher told the youngsters to go home and kiss their mother's
 
hand (and press it to their forehead as a sign of respect) on
 
Mother's Day,  and also practiced in formal situations  as whey
 
one of the teachers required her pupils to kiss her hand befoi
 
receiving their certificate during the closing ceremony for the
 
school.
 Turkish two-cheek kissing was practiced by all the
 
teachers at the ceremony!
 
I
II 
Children are expected to be familiar with these gestures,  and
 
are required to perform them in public as signs of their
 
enculturation in Turkish behavior.

Although attention may not be drawn to these kinds of folk
 
expressions in formal lessons,  children are exposed to them
 
at Ataturk School in conversations among their mothers and
 
teachers,  and given an opportunity to try them out and be
 
corrected in their usage.
 
Lan ua e provides not only a vocabu:Lary and  idioms which
 
create a common medium in which those who know the code ma y
 
communicate, but it also provides a worLd-view./'Ty  fact,  there
 
is no satisfactory E
n glish equivalent for many Turkish concepts.
 
By teaching Turkish as a mother tongue,  and not as a second lan-
ua e,  thereby avoiding much direct translation, Ataturk School
 
operates within the Turkish world-view, and passes it on to the
 
children.
 
Symboi l
l
 
In addition to being able to communicate in the Turkish
 
language, being Turkish involves being familiar with Turkish
 
history and symbols.
 Especially this includes knowledge of
 
the history of the Turkish Republic,  acknowledgment of Ataturk
 
as a culture hero,  and fam iliarity with the geography of
 
Turkey.
 Ataturk School provides its students with this bod':
 
of knowledge.
 
ustafa Ke a:
 :atur:
 the f irst president of modern
 
:u
-key,  is the school's namesake and hero.
 The mothers
 
a::ing area is dominated by a mural depicting Ataturk's
 
great
 
humanism and Quoting his wise sayings.
 The holidays celebrated
 
throughout the school year are mostly founded by Ataturk.
 The
 
children recite his speeches,  sing songs glorifying his
 
achievements,  and listen to speeches on formal occasions
 
holding him up as a great man to be emulated and served.
 He
 
is depicted as a leader of the victorious Turks and founder
 
ci the nation in the 19th of 1
,
lay speech being practiced by
 
one of the children for the 19th of May celebration
 Recogni-
tion of the greatness of Ataturk is closely linked with
 
knowledge of the founding of the Turkish Republic.  and with
 
the establjs r
nent of nationalistic pride and self-respect for
 
the ordinary Turk,  who was not highly esteemed during the
 
Period of the Ottoman Empire,  and especially during its
 
decline toward the end of the nineteenth century.
 
As they are taught to respond to Ataturk as the symbol of
 
modern Turkey and the source of modern Turkish patriotism  the
 
children at Ataturk School are also taught to respond to t
 
Turkish flag,  to sing the national' Ã nthem and other patrjot c
 
songs like "To Be a Turk is the Greatest Honor," and to recog-
nize Turkish folk costumes and music.
 
Relicic
 
Recently religion has been added as a subject at Ataturk
 
School.
 In Turkey,  to be Turkish means to be Muslim,  and wben
 
someone has converted to Islam,  the saying goes,  'e became
 
a Turk."  Although being Muslim is so closely associated with
 
being Turkish,  many modern educated Turks are secular and do
 
not practice religion.
 Mrs.  Earcio 1u told me that parents
 
at Ataturk School wished to have religion taught in the school
 
because they are aware of the saliency of religion as a deter-
minant of identity in America.
 In other words religion, which
 
for some would not be stressed as an important element of iden-
tity in Turkey where nearly everyone is born into the same
 
religion,  becomes stressed in America where religion is often
 
a component of ethnic identity,  and sometimes even stands
 
alone as a label or designator of group affiliation,  e.g.
 
Catholic.  Protestant or Jew.
 Some parents',  especially those
 
,,
l
.
-ho are most educated and would have stressed religion least
 
in Turkey,  feel that their children are getting more of a
 
religious training here than they would ha ve  ha d in Turkey,
 
because of the inclusion of religion in the curriculum cÂ±
 
Ataturk School.
 (In Ataturk School,  as in Turkey,  religion
 
is an optional  subject.
 
:hcu h there are parents at Ataturk School  oho carry
 
secularj
 to the point of celebrating Christmas
 
their children as a secular holiday,  others take advan-
:age od the winter holiday season to impress their Turkish
 
identity on their children.
 One parent pointed out that her
 
child s exposure to Judaism as an acceptable alternative to
 
Christianity in America made it easi er  f
 
ri ti
 or her to present Islam
 
as still another alternative,  and the only appropriate one for
 
Turks like themselves to espouse.
 Whether or not they practice
 
Islam (there are some families at Ataturk School who attend
 
mosque and pray regularly),  children at the school are exposed
 
to a body of religious knowledge which reinforces their Turkish-
ness and differentiates them from other Americans.
 
ATATUF
.K SCHOOL AS A SOCIAL CE NT ER

In-Gathering
  
Quite apart from the curriculum,  Ataturk School as a
 
center where Turks can gather and act Turkish,  is an important
 
source of Turkish identification
 More than one mother let
 
on that although the manifest purpose of bringing her child to
 
Ataturk School is to improve i s knowledge c  T
 
most compelling reason for coming is to soc1
 
other mothers.
 
-ca:her:nc is also very important  for the estabjisj ment
 
erÂ­ e -
, u a icn
 group norms and-
- values.
 A reference ;roup
 
nrpi
.-ides standards against which members measure their self-
worth and success.
 The mothers and children who gather regu-
larlv at Ataturk School sort out acceptable and unacceptable
 
behaviors icr group members on the basis of interactions in
 
which they participate.
 "Turkish" behaviors--the use of
 
Turkish language,  gestures,  greetings,  etc.,  are highly
 
rewarded, while un-Turkish behaviors--refusing to sit and
 
visit,  use of English,  etc.
,
 are either sharply criticized,
 
or ignored.
 Career mothers may avoid the zathering not only
 
because It Consumes so much time,  but also because they do
 
not live up to the standards of traditional Turkish woman-
hood that are manifested there.
 If so,  the absence of career
 
mothers is an excellent example of the power of in- atherIi
 
to set group stPndards and  eliminate nor-conforming behavior.

ient of Turkish-Ar
nericanness
  
or the children,  Ataturk School is the one place where
 
they experience a large number of Turks congregating in a
 
limited space on a regular basis.
 It may be the one place
 
for some of them,  outside the home, where their Turkish
 
identity is sa11e't,  and they get a chance to practice it.
 
The inclusion of the children of consular staff,  or "Turkish
 
Turks"  (as opposed to "American Turks") in the student body,
 
further emphasizes that this is a
chool for Turkish children,
 
and brings out the commonality between the children born in
 
America and their Turkish brethren.
 
Of greater significance for the children,  however, Ataturk
 
School is not only a place to learn Turkishness,  but also an
 
arena where they can act out the tensions involved in being
 
bi-cultural.
 Many children spend most of the week,  at least
 
in public,  ignoring or even denying their differences from
 
other American children.
 Several told me that there is no
 
oPPortunity at their public schools to share aspects of their
 
ethnic heritage with other children,  and several boys assured
 
their .-
 
_c a
-"  friends teased them merc i
lessly if
 
slit a Turki h-ism in their behavior.
 Some have American
 
nicknames to mask
 hejr Turkish names.
 Yet these very same
 
children ;
vill :
T:gh:.  if necessary,
 
to protect the good name
 
The tenscon involved in being bi-cultural is partly acted
 
out in the display of dislike of Ataturk School by many of
 
the cnildren.
 The children tell me that they are "Turkish
 
enough.'  and have no use for the enculturation they experience
 
at the school.
 They are highly sensitive about their Turkish-
ness,  and do not enjoy having it "rubbed in."  One boy provided
 
a clue to the noisy negative feelings expressed by the children
 
by telling me that be would really like to go to a Turkish
 
school in Turkey,  but that his parents told him that it is too
 
expensive.
  
' ,
 He seems to be
 
saying that he would like to be all-Turkish in Turkey,  or
 
all-American in America,  but that being both is a strain.
 
After trying all week to be just like any other American kid,
 
it must be difficult for the youngsters to "turn on" Turkish
 
on Saturdays.
 However,  the one adult  I interviewed who coy
 
look back on such an experience herself says that she appr ,
 
ciated it,  and is providing her child with the same experience
 
Perhaps one of the greatest services Ataturk School provides
 
to the children is an opportunity to vent their negative feel-
ings to each other in a safe environment.
 These feelings,
 
which would be anti-Turkish if shared with American friends,
 
or Turkish parents,  become part of the culture of Turkish-
Americanism.
 Ataturk School is wise to provide the students
 
unsuperv sed lunch Period where the children
 
Can
 :sc:targe the tensions they feel in a situation v
,here
 
sunport and understanding is Possible and they
 
are
 
;ro:ectei from the disa prcval of adult authority figures.
 
If one of the manifest funct ions  of Ataturk School is
 
to socialize children living in America as Turks,  one of the
 
important latent functions is to provide an organized vehicle
 
-or the fcrmuaa: cn 01  not a Turkish,  out a Turkish-American
 
culture.
 Americanisms in the children's dress (bluejeans and
 
sneakers for many),  food (pizza),  use of the Turkish language
 
("I ate breakfastÂ­ instead of "I did or made breakfast" which
 
is idiomatic) are readily accepted.
 Children are provided
 
with unst ruct ured  time to share their own values and experiences.
 
The formal structure of the-school is  dedicated to the use of
 
strictly Turkish curricula,  but the informal structure can
 
not help but model a blend of Turk T
hh and American culture.
 
CONCLUSION
 
My conclusion is brief.
 There are many children in the
 
United States today studying in ethnic heritage schools.
 
Some,  like the Turks of Ataturk School,  may have the Option
 
of going "home" somed ay, an d some
 don't.
 
Some,
 like
 the  Turks
 
of this study,  may be first generation Americans,  and others
 
may be second,  third,  or even fourth generation Americans.
 
A l
l are being taught that roots are valuable,  that althou h
 
America may be a great place to live it  is important to have
 
an identity and heritage.

 It has been
 
estimated that there were less than 100,000 Turks in the United

 About 1,000 Turks per year, mostly
 
engineers and doctors have been immigrating during the past twenty

of Ataturk School,  for making this study possible.
 Not only

graciously gave me curriculum materials.
 I gratefully

in the project,  and regret any inconvenience my presence at the
 
school may have caused them.
 
I also wish to thank the parents,  students and teachers
 
of Ataturk School who extended their interest,  cooperation
 
and acceptance to me,  and who were eager to answer my ques-

houses lockers for the teachers, principal, and league president, and

Administrators, faculty, and parents all expressed satisfaction
 
with the current location of the school. They feel that it is their own
 
space, that there is adequate provision for the classes and waiting
 
parents, and that they have storage room for the equipment necessary
 
for the school.

There are other Turkish schools in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and
 
Queens, but some families from each of these boroughs bring their
 
children to Ataturk School. The Brooklyn school serves a special
 
constituency of Crimean Turks who settled here after World War II and
 
have their own organizations. The Queens and Bronx schools also
 
apparently serve special sub-ethnic populations. Ataturk School offers
 
an education consistent with the culture of the modern Turkish nation
 
and does not appeal to any particular sub-ethnic group. Parents bring
 
their children to the school because they see themselves as mainstream
 
Turks, because of its central location, and because Ataturk School
 
offers an opportunity to connect with the American-Turkish elite.
 
The first impression one gets of Ataturk school is that it is a
 
place full of life and exuberance. Children race and tumble amidst a
 
cacophonous din before, between, and after classes. Boys wrestle and
 
toss around each other's hats, shoes, or books, while girls wander
 
about in groups of two or three, talking, playing games like "London
 
Bridge," and drawing on blackboards.
 
During classes the demeanor is more decorous, however. Teachers
 
the children to sit quietly and copy the lessons from the board,
 
take dictation, or listen to each other recite.

School Adminstration
 
Ataturk School i
s sponsored by the American-Turkish Women's
 
League, an organization affiliated with the Federation of
 
Turkish-American Societies. The Women's League was formally r
egistered
 
in 1
956 in Albany, New York, but was started informally by a woman
 
educator between 1
948 and 1
950. According to its current president,
 
M nevver Uzdil, the league has several objectives: to foster ethnic
 
awareness and knowledge in Turkish-American children, to administer
 
Ataturk School, and t
o further friendship and love between Turks and
 
Americans in the United States. The league currently has over two
 
hundred members, but, as in many organizations, the work of supporting
 
and maintaining the school reportedly falls to a dozen members.
 
The Women's League raises money for the school budget â€”about $10,000
 
per year â€”selects teachers and a principal, oversees the acquisition of
 
curriculum materials from Turkey, sets tuition fees and
 
plans and organizes school functions, such as holiday
 
Money i
s raised by charging entrance fees to some school functions,
 
selling food, and P
=
 
'
nd-raising events, such as t
eas and
 
balls. There are conflicting reports as to whether the Turkish
 
government subsidizes the school in any other way than by contributing
 
space. In any case, however, the Women's League i
s independent of the
 
Turkish government and takes full responsibility for the existence of
 
Ataturk School.

Teachers
 
The teachers at Ataturk School are professional educators from
 
Turkey living in the United States. A great deal of stress i
s placed on
 
the qualifications of the teachers, all of whom teach at the school
 
because of their concern for Turkish children and love of teaching.
 
They are paid an honorarium of $25 per week for their services, which
 
is seen as merely meeting their expenses. One goal of the school is to
 
eventually raise the teachers' pay.
 
All of the classroom teachers at the school have teaching
 
certificates from Turkish institutions, or are professional educators.
 
One spent his professional life in Turkey editing and publishing
 
textbooks. Another taught school in Turkey and Germany. The music
 
teacher is a man whose avocation has been performing Turkish music at
 
public functions for many years, and the folk dance teacher has danced
 
in a prize-winning Turkish folk-dancing troupe which toured Europe. The
 
religion teacher has two graduate degrees from Istanbul University, a
 
certificate
, from the High Institute of Islam in Istanbul, and works as
 
a full-time im
or priest and school administrator for a Turkish
 
community in Brooklyn.
 
The principal of the Ataturk School, Mrs. Kar4 o lu, taught
 
biology at the college level in Turkey and has a certificate from
 
Teachers' College at Columbia University. Mrs. bzdil, president of the
 
Women's League and a school administrator, taught for many years in a
 
private school in Brooklyn and served as its principal.

Classes and Curriculum
 
The curriculum a
t Ataturk School is derived f
rom books published
 
by the National Education Ministry in Turkey and monthly magazines fo
 
each grade published by one of the large Turkish
 
-
 
113- 3
 
the books and magazines in the classes in accordance with their
 
appropriate grade level. Pupils are required to pay $
1 for each book
 
they take for the year. At the end of the year they can return the
 
books if they wish and get their money back
 
Since the school has only a few hours per week in which to make
 
use of the materials, much is left out in the lessons. No attempt i
s
 
made t
o teach science and math, for instance. Emphasis i
s placed on
 
Turkish language, history, social s
tudies, music, and religion. Songs
 
and poetry are stressed in nursery-kindergarten, reading and writing in
 
first grade, and social studies and history in the higher grades.  All
 
grades are taught in Turkish. I was unable to obtain lesson plans, but
 
was told that the t
eachers choose their study materials at the
 
beginning of the school year in conference with the principal. Yearly,
 
monthly, and weekly lesson plans are made.
 
The curriculum materials are chosen with several goals in mind.
 
Many parents and teachers stress the importance of the children's
 
knowing the Turkish language well. In fact, children have the
 
impression that language instruction is
 
to
 
1ï¿½
.
4ï¿½ 
the main purpose of the school.
 
7
 
The  fostering  of  ethnic  pride  is al so emphasized.
 To this
 
end,  lessons stress the gl ori es of  Turkish hi story,  the
 
ireatness of  Mustafa Kemal  Ataturk--the  founder  of modern
 
urkey--and  the beauties of the Turkish homeland.
 Thi s
 
body of  knowl edge,  along with ability to speak  Turkish,  is
 
an  important  marker of Turki sh  identity.
 
Religi on has been added  recentl y as a subject  at
 
Ataturk School.
 In Turkey to be Turkish means to be
 
Musli m,  and  when someone has converted  to  Isl am,  the saying
 
goes,  "He became a Turk."
 Although being Muslim  is so
 
cl osely associated with being Turki sh,  many educated Turks
 
are secular  and do not  practice religion.

There is a lunch beak at  12. 00 noon.
 Most  children
 
A
 
bring  their  lunch,  although some parents bring  in  pizzas  at
 
lunchtime and have their  chi -1
 dren share with  their
 
'
:1 assrnates.
 Although one teacher  stays upstairs  in  the
 
cl ass area on  "l unch duty,
"  no attempt  is made to enforce
 
orderly behavi or  at  this time--short  of throwing  food or
 
injuring someone,  most  kinds of horsing around are
 
tolerated,  along with soaring noise levels.
 Some children
 
go downstairs to have lunch in the waiting room with the
 
parents.
 Most  of  the lunches are American-styl e sandwiches
 
and drinks.
 There was not  any noticeable tendency  for
 
children to bring Turkish-style picnic  foods  for  lunch.
 
8
 
When classes are called back into session, lunch refuse is packed
 
away in overflowing wastebaskets and children resume a quieter
 
demeanor. Every other week the music teacher and the religion teacher
 
arrive. The school is divided in half and the two teachers alternate
 
between each half of the school. Sometimes, during the week when the
 
teachers do not come, the whole school is called  t
gether and the
 
regular teachers teach Turkish songs. For example, the teachers taught
 
the children the song "My Mother" in preparation for Mother's Day. The
 
lyrics describe an older child longing to have mother hold him in her
 
lap and sing lullabies again,  l
ike she did when he was small.
 
School i
s l
et out at 3
:00 P
.M. Children drift away, except for
 
those staying for the folk-dance class. About a dozen children seem to
 
be involved in the class. They were practicing for the 1
9th of May
 
:lebration during the weeks I observed the school.
 
School allows many different teaching styles. The first
 
:
a e teacher uses warmth, physical contact, and praise to encourage
 
e youngsters to behave well. Good work is rewarded with red ribbons
 
pinned to the children's clothing and called to the attention of anyone
 
around who might be interested. The second- and third-grade teachers
 
are more formal in their approach to the classroom and are more stern.
 
They use stern voice tone, scolding, and occasional ear tweaking to
 
encourage the children to settle down and do their work. Both of the
 
classrooms are set up with rows of seats facing the blackboard.  The
 
fourth- and fifth-grade teachers are more soft spoken, but also use a
 
9
 
stern voice t o n e  to guide the youngsters towards good
 
behavi or  and  good work.
 The seats  in the  fourth-grade
 
'
:lass are set  up  in a circle and  those  in  the  fifth grade
 
are in arcs around the teacher' s desk.

uh  lessons are dedicated  to language learning
 
and  proper  Turki sh etiquette,  Ataturk  School  also provides
 
formal  occasions and  informal  situations in which children
 
pick u p  proper  Turkish comportment.
 Turks engage in a
 
whole range of polite behaviors which are unfamiliar  to
 
Americans.
 Greeting behaviors,  incl uding cheek and hand
 
kissing accompanied by appropriate verbal  expressions,  are
 
very important.
 Children are expected to be  familiar  with
 
these gestures,  and are required to perform them in public
 
as signs of their  soci alization  in Turki sh culture.
 On the
 
final  day of classes,  for  example,  one of the

younger girls went around and kissed the cheeks and hands of some of
 
the "aunts" (as Turkish children are taught to address adult women
 
gathered in the waiting area off the school lobby) in a formal and
 
polite farewell. This behavior was highly praised and appreciated,  both
 
by the recipients of the gesture and by the mother of the girl, who

Parents
 
Ataturk School serves first-generation Turkish immigrant families
 
living in the New York metropolitan area and the Turkish consular staff
 
serving temporarily in this country. Some of the children were born in
 
the United States, others in Turkey. Many Turkish immigrants
 
represented in t
he school population are members o
f the intelligentsia
 
who came here as college students and stayed t
o practice professions,
 
but workers and small entrepreneurs are also present. The families
 
whose members I interviewed include several individuals with Ph.D.s,
 
families in which both the father and mother have professional careers,
 
families in which the sole wage earner i
s a mechanic, building
 
superintendent, engineer, doctor, or diplomat, and families in which
 
both parents run a small business, such as adry cleaning
 
establishment, r
estaurant, or t
ailor shop.
 
The families interviewed exhibit differences in their commitment
 
to l
iving in America. No one interviewed admitted that they never
 
planned t
o return t
o Turkey. Everyone had been t
o Turkey within the
 
last f
ive or s
ix years, at least a
s visitors. S
ome are in the United
 
States with short-term goal , such as completing an assignment from the
 
Turkish foreign ministry or educating a youngster s 4-mind. Others are
 
raising their families here because of favorable economic conditions,
 
but hope t
o return t
o Turkey. Among the most h
ighly educated families
 
are some who have made a conscious decision t
o settle in America, but,
 
when pressed, even t
hey do not rule out retiring in Turkey eventually.
 
My observations indicated that the most educated families are
 
most a
ssimilated and most secure in their decision t
o remain in
 
America, except for those working in the diplomatic corps. The least
 
educated tend to r
emain more Turkish in their language and behavior, to
 
view their stay in America as an economic adaptation to difficult
 
times, and to anticipate their eventual return "home." Many demonstrate
 
1
2
 
the "boxes in the closet syndrome" â€”whenever they purchase an appliance
 
they save the box, because someday it will be packed up and sent to
 
Turkey!
 
While school is in session, twenty or more mothers usually gather
 
in the waiting area of the lobby, where benches, chairs, and a
 
coffeepot are provided. Less than half a dozen fathers may gather at
 
the opposite end of the room from the mothers. The fathers sometimes
 
engage in conversation, sometimes read a newspaper, or just s
it
 
quietly. The mothers engage in lively conversation and gossip, making
 
the occasion into an important social event. For some this is the only
 
chance they have to meet regularly with other Turkish women â€”certainly,
 
to sit with a whole group of them â€”as is common for women in Turkey to
 
do.2 Sometimes a mother brings homemade cakes for the gathering. Most
 
of the women who sit in the lobby are homemakers, and my impression is
 
that the core who come most faithfully are wives of blue-collar
 
workers. I have also spoken to wives of professional men, however, who
 
like to visit with the other mothers, at least occasionally. I did not
 
find any career women among them.
 
The talk, which is in Turkish, revolves around homemaking skills,
 
like cooking and sewing, shopping, ill health and fortune among
 
acquaintances, problems of adaptation to American life, and events at
 
the school. The gathering is an important clearing house for
 
information concerning products available, proprietors worth
 
patronizing, housing, vacations, and coping with American and Turkish
 
institutions. It also serves as an ad hoc PTA for the school. The
 
1
3
 
principal r
egularly joins the mothers for s
ome t
ime each week,
 
discussing school matters and the contributions expected from the
 
parents, such as preparing the children's outfits and food f
or special
 
events. Teachers sometimes join in the conversations before and after
 
classes.
 
At t
he end of t
he school day, as parents and children drift away,
 
some mothers stay t
o make the most of a last few moments of
 
conversation, urging their friends not to be in a rush to l
eave. There
 
i
s some Turkishâ€”style kissing on both cheeks among the mothers at
 
parting.
 
Purposes of the School
 
The purposes of the school include socialization in Turkish
 
identity for the children, enculturatlon in Turkish language and world
 
view, Turkish ethnic group formation, and provision of a f
orum where
 
bicultural children can formulate their own value system.3 Many
 
reasons are given by parents, t
eachers, and administrators for their
 
participation in Ataturk School. Underlying all of the reasons i
s a
 
burning concern that the children acquire and retain a sense of
 
Turkishness, a s
ense of identity and ethnic pride. All are willing to
 
give their t
ime and energy for the r
ewards of hearing the children
 
speak Turkish, seeing them write Turkish, and participate in Turkish
 
events.
 
1

College-educated parents show an awareness of "
identity crisis"
 
and express concern that their children formulate a sense of identity
 
and know "who they are." They f
eel Ataturk School can provide this for
 
their children. Less educated parents demonstrate less interest in
 
abstract identity and more concern for their children's continuation of
 
traditions that are familiar t
o them; they do not
 
from their children and their homeland by los e of
 
culture. One mother, born in America  and married
 
want t
o be cut off
 
the language and
 
t
o a Turkish-born
 
man, expressed a f
ear that if she did not expose her s
on to an e
thnic
 
education he would one day accuse her of depriving him of his
 
birthright.
 
Turkish language acquisition for the children seems t
o be one of
 
the primary goals of the school. All curriculum materials are in
 
Turkish exclusively. The only c
lassroom in which English is frequently
 
spoken by the teacher is the first class, in which there are children
 
less familiar with Turkish. Even there an attempt is made to conduct
 
most matters in Turkish. One teacher eloquently expressed to me the
 
need for the children to be fluent in Turkish so that they would be
 
able t
o feel at home in Turkey. He likened Turkish children in America
 
without the Turkish language t
o n
ightingales in a gilded cage. No
 
matter how beautiful and rich the cage, the inhabitant i
s still not
 
free. To be free â€”to return to their homeland i
f they
 
wishâ€” Turkish-American youngsters must have command of the Turkish
 
language and culture.
 
1
5
 
Attitudes towards the use of the Turkish language vary with the
 
education of the parents and the degree of their assimilation. Parents
 
with a career are more likely to r
eport speaking English t
o their
 
children at home. One family in which both parents are involved in
 
American careers employs a Turkish housekeeper to care for the children
 
and speak Turkish with them. College-educated parents emphasize the
 
general benefits which accrue to language-skill acquisition in business
 
and the academic world as part of their reaaon for sending their
 
children to Ataturk School. Since these parents are also most concerned
 
about assimilation themselves, however, they most often speak English
 
t
o their children, "
to make sure the child understands," t
o facilitate
 
the child's adjustment to his American peers, or to perfect their own
 
skills in English. Wives of highly educated professionals complained
 
most t
o me about their inadequate English; they speak English better
 
than the other mothers, but not as well as their husbands. One
 
blue-collar mother reports speaking Turkish to her children at home
 
because her ethnic neighbors told her that, if she did not, her
 
children would loA
's
e the language, as theirs had. She feels that she is
 
sacrificing her own opportunity to learn English better for the good of
 
her children.
 
M1nevver 5
zdil, president of the American Turkish Women's League
 
which sponsors the school, has a more broad-reaching vision for the
 
school. She sees i
t not only as a l
anguage-teaching institution and
 
link between Turkish-American children and their homeland, but also as
 
a fosterer of a Turkish ethnic presence in the United States. Fully
 
aware of the small number of Turks living in this country, she is
 
1
6
 
concerned that they be able to unite and make their voice heard and
 
respected. She expects that creating Turkish-conscious youngsters who
 
are educated and aware will contribute to this cause. The children, she
 
says, are taught that they are representatives of the Turkish community
 
in their public lives, and they must be careful to set a good example,
 
to be loving and fair to their fellows, so that others will know that
 
the Turks are a loving and friendly people.
 
Students
 
There i
s a difference between the children and their parents over
 
the issue of staying in America permanently. Although many youngsters
 
professed insecurity about their future in this country, most indicated
 
quite strongly that they want to spend the rest of their lives here. No
 
child showed any reluctance to assimilate, to speak English, to have
 
American friends, dress in American clothes, and enjoy American foods.
 
This includes children of the consular staff. On the other hand, some
 
children did
., show a reluctance to stress Turkish behaviors, including
 
use of the Turkish language, but none seemed eager to forget about
 
being Turkish altogether.
 
The children, like children in most ethnic schools, profess little
 
interest in the issues of such burning importance to their elders, and
 
most would rather be doing something else on Saturday. Boys especially
 
are eager to disclaim any interest at all in their Turkish studies,  to
 
assure me that they are hostage to their parents and are "made to come
 
1
7
 
to this school." Most children believe that they are at t
he school t
o
 
learn Turkish because their parents do not think that they know the
 
language well enough. The children feel that they do know the language
 
1
0
 
and that they get along
 
see the need for learning all the history and social s
tudies, singing,
 
and religion taught a
t the school. Many who feel unhappy about the
 
school give boredom as their reason; most also feel bored with their
 
public school education, although some make distinctlons between the
 
two. Several girls did feel free t
o tell me that they enjoy Ataturk
 
School, they like learning Turkish better, and find Turkish history
 
interesting.

The children I spoke with have American friends where they live
 
and do not especially seek out Turks, even when they are in the same
 
school, unless their families carry on relationships with the other
 
families. Some of the children have acquired Americanized nicknames.
 
When asked if they share their Turkish culture with their American
 
friends, more than one child told me that their friends tease them when
 
they act or appear Turkish, and that they want to pass as any o
ther
 
American. Some play on softball or soccer teams, take music lessons, or
 
belong t
o a YMCA with their American friends. When extracurricular
 
activities conflict with attendance at Ataturk School, sometimes
 
attendance at the school is sacrificed. One girl told me that she had
 
missed several Saturdays because of softball.
 
I

When a
sked what they like b

responded "

that even for the disaffected the school holds the pleasure o

associating with other Turkish-American youngsters in the same
 
situation. Since the children come from such scattered homes, school
 
provides the only regular opportunity for some students to b
e in a
 
gathering of Turks, t
o feel that they are not alone or weird, and t
o
 
create a culture of shared Turkish-American experience.

jAlmost all transactions that occur
 
at Ataturk School are conducted in Turkish, with t

banter that goes on among the children, and even that i
s sometimes in
 
TU
 rkish.
 
Language provides not only a vocabulary and idioms which create a
 
common medium in which those who know the code may communicate, but it
 
also provides a world view.5 In fact, there is no satisfactory English
 
equivalent for many Turkish concepts. By teaching Turkish a
s a mother
 
language and not a
s a second language, thereby avoiding much direct
 
translation, Ataturk School operates within the Turkish world view and
 
passes it on t
o the children.
 
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the first president of modern Turkey, is
 
the school's namesake and hero. The mothers' waiting area i
s domir
 
by a mural depicting Ataturk's great humanism and quoting his wis
 
sayings. The holidays celebrated throughout the school year were mostly
 
established
.
. by Ataturk. On those occasions the children recite his
 
sing songs glorifying his achievements, and listen to
 
speeches which hold him up as a great man to be emulated and served. He
 
is depicted as a leader of the victorious Turks and founder of the
 
nation in the 1
9th o
f May speech being practiced by one of the children
 
for the celebration on that date. Recognition of the greatness of
 
Ataturk is inspired by knowledge about the founding of the Turkish
 
Republic, which increased nationalistic pride and self-respect for the
 
ordinary Turk. The children at the school are taught t
o r
espond to
 
20
 
Ataturk a
s the symbol of modern Turkey and the source of modern Turkish
 
patriotism. They are also taught to respond to the Turkish flag, to
 
sing the national anthem and other patriotic songs like "To Be a Turk
 
Is the Greatest Honor," and to recognize Turkish folk costumes and
 
music.
 
Concerning the religious component in the school's curriculum,
 
Mrs. Karcio lu told me that parents at the school wished to have
 
religion taught because they are aware of the saliency of r
eligion as a
 
determinant of identity in America. In other words, religion, which f
(
.
 
some would not be stressed as an important element of identity in
 
Turkey, where nearly everyone is born into the same religion, becomes
 
stressed in America, where religion is often a component of ethnic
 
identity and sometimes even stands alone as a label or designator of
 
group affiliation, e.g., Catholic, Protestant, or Jew.  Some parents,
 
especially those who are most educated and would have stressed religion
 
least in Turkey, feel that their children are getting more religious
 
training here than they would have in Turkey, because of the inclusion
 
of religion in the school curriculum. As in Turkey, however, religion
 
is an optional subject.
 
Although there are parents at Ataturk School who carry over their
 
secularism to the point of celebrating Christmas for their children as
 
a oeculev holiday, others take advantage of the winter holiday season
 
to impress their Turkish identity on their children. One parent
 
pointed out that her child's exposure to Judaism as an acceptable
 
alternative to Christianity in America made it easier for her to
 
2
1
 
p
resent I
slam a
s yet another alternative, and the only appropriate one
 
for Turks like themselves to espouse. Whether or not they practice
 
Islam, children at the school are exposed to a body of r
eligious
 
knowledge which reinforces their Turkishness and differentiates them
 
from o
ther Americans.
 
Quite apart f
rom the curriculum, Ataturk School i
s an important
 
source o
f Turkish identification as a center. where Turks can gather and
 
act Turkish. More than one mother acknowledged that, although the
 
manifest purpose of bringing her child to the school i
s t
o improve his
 
or her knowledge of Turkish, the more compelling reason i
s to socialize
 
with the other mothers.
 
In-gathering i
s also very important for the establishment and
 
perpetuation of group norms and values. A reference group provides
 
standards against which members measure their self-worth and success.6
 
The mothers and children who gather regularly at Ataturk School sort
 
out acceptable and unacceptable behaviors for group members on the
 
basis of interactions in which they participate. "Turkish"
 
behaviors â€”the use of Turkish language, gestures, and greetings â€”are
 
highly r
ewarded, while un-Turkish behaviors â€”refusing to sit and visit,
 
or the use of English â€”are either sharply criticized or ignored. Career
 
mothers may avoid the gathering, not only because it consumes so much
 
t
ime but also because they do not live up to the standards of
 
traditional Turkish womanhood that are manifested there. I
f so, the
 
22
 
absence of career mothers is an excellent example of the power of
 
in-gathering to set group standards and eliminate non-conforming
 
behavior.
 
Besides providing a scene where Turkish in-group behavior can be
 
honed and developed for Turkish-Americans, Ataturk School provides a
 
focus for Turks in the area, who are otherwise divided in their
 
loyalties by their socio-economic status, sub-ethnic interests, and
 
commitment to assimilation in the United States. One father pointed out
 
that although the Turkish-American community has become fragmented
 
during the past few years by the proliferation of associations formed
 
by Turkish interest groups7, the members of many of the groups support
 
Ataturk School. Children at the school are exposed, therefore, to a
 
cross section of Turkish society in the United States. The mutual
 
agreement on the part of many groups to submit their children to a
 
single curriculum means that there is a common denominator of
 
Turkishness shared by all.
 
For the children Ataturk School is the one place they experience a
 
large number of Turks congregating in a limited space on a regular
 
basis. It may be the one place outside their home for some of them
 
where their Turkish identity is salient and where they get a chance to
 
practice it. The inclusion in the student body of the children of
 
consular staff, "Turkish Turks" (as opposed to "American Turks"),
 
further emphasizes the fact that Ataturk is a school for Turkish
 
children. It also brings out the commonality between the children born
 
in America and their Turkish brethren.

that Ataturk School i
s not only a place to learn Turkishness but also
 
b
lic,
 
noring or even denying their differences from other American
 
i
ildren. Several told me that there i
s no opportunity at their public
 
schools t
o share aspects of their ethnic heritage with other children,
 
and several boys assured me that their American friends teased them
 
mercilessly if they let slip a Turkish-ism in their behavior. Some have
 
American nicknames t
o mask their Turkish names. Yet these very same
 
children will fight, if necessary, to protect the good name of Turks.
 
The tension involved in being bicultural i
s partly acted out in
 
the display of dislike of Ataturk School by many of the children. The
 
children tell me that they are "Turkish enough" and have no use for
 
the enculturation they experience at the school. They are highly
 
sensitive about their Turkishness; they do not enjoy having it "rubbed
 
in." One boy provided a clue t
o the noisy negative feelings expressed
 
by the children by telling me that he would really like to go t
o a
 
Turkish school in Turkey, but that his parents told him that it is too
 
expensive. He seems to be saying that he would like to be all Turkish
 
in Turkey, or all American in America, but that being both i
s a strain.
 
After trying all week to be just like any other American kid, i
t must
 
be difficult for the youngsters to "turn on" Turkish on Saturdays. The
 
one adult I interviewed who could look back on such an experience
 
herself, however, says that she appreciated it and is providing her
 
24
 
child with the same experience. Perhaps one of the greatest services
 
Ataturk School offers the the children is an opportunity to vent their
 
negative feelings to each other in a safe environment. These feelings,
 
which would be anti-Turkish if shared with American friends or Turkish
 
parents, become part of the culture of Turkish-Americanism. Ataturk
 
School is wise to provide the students with a relatively unsupervised
 
lunch period during which the children can discharge the tensions they
 
feel in a situation in which mutual support and understanding is
 
possible and they are protected from the disapproval of adult authority
 
figures.
 
If  a  "  the manifest functions of Ataturk School is to socialize
 
children 14wia& l
ia Am rIca as Turk , one of the important latent
 
functions is to provide an organized vehicle for the form ulation of a
 
Turkish-American culture. Americanisms in the children's dress
 
(blue jeans and sneakers for many), food (pizza), and use of Turkish
 
language (
"1 ate breakfast" rather than "I did or made breakfast" which
 
is idiomatic) are readily accepted. Children are provided with
 
unstructured time to share their own values and experiences. The formal
 
structure of the school is dedicated to the use of strictly Turkish
 
curricula, but the informal structure can not help but model a blend of
 
Turkish and American culture.
 
'Unlike some of the communities documented by the Ethnic Heritage and
 
Language Schools project, the Turks do not have an archive recording
 
the history of the Turkish community in New York or the United States.
 
It has been estimated that there were fewer than 100,000 Turks in the
 
United States in the late 1970s. About 1
,000 Turks per year, mostly
 
engineers and doctors, have been immigrating during the past twenty
 
years. Although there is a plethora of Turkish organizations in the
 
United States, most are small and relatively inactive. See Talat S

Space was inadequate at the United Nations School, making
 
teachers, pupils, and parents unhappy. In 1978 Ataturk School moved to
 
its present location, where it is again housed at the expense of the
 
Turkish government. It is now on the second floor of a large office
 
building. The large space i
s divided up into smaller areas through the
 
2
 
use of partitions. They are moved into place each week to accomodate
 
the school, creating areas for six classes â€”kindergarten through
 1f
th
 
cr de.
 
include carrying folding chairs into the class areas and rolling
 
blackboards to desired locations. At the end of the day everything has
 
to be put away; school materials are stored in a small room set aside
 
for the women's league. The room also huuses lockers for the teachers,
 
principal, and league president, and curriculum materials. For special
 
occasions the entire floor can be opened up and turned into an
 
auditorium.
 
Administrators, faculty, and parents all expressed satisfaction
 
with the current location of the school. They feel that it is their own
 
space, that there are adequate provisions for the classes and waiting
 
parents, and that they have sufficient storage space for the school's
 
equipment.
 
The school began nine years ago with only one class; today it has
 
a total of six, including a kindergarten. There are nine teachers â€”six
 
classroom teachers, a music teacher, a folk-dance teacher, and a
 
religion teacher â€”serving approximately ninety pupils aged four through
 
fifteen.

Although there are other Turkish schools in Bronx, Brooklyn,
 
and Queens, some families from each of these boroughs bring their
 
children to Ataturk School. The Brooklyn school serves a special
 
constituency of Crimean Turks who settled here after World War II and
 
have their own organizations. The Queens and Bronx schools also
 
apparently serve special sub-ethnic populations. Ataturk School offers
 
an education consistent with the culture of the modern Turkish nation
 
and does not appeal to any particular sub-ethnic group. Parents bring
 
their children to the school because they see themselves as mainstream
 
Turks, because of its central location, and because Ataturk School
 
offers an opportunity to c
onnect with the Turkish-American elite.
 
The first impression one gets of Ataturk school is that it is a
 
place full of life and exuberance. Children race and tumble amidst a
 
cacophonous din before, between, and after classes. Boys wrestle and
 
toss around each other's hats, shoes, or books, while girls wander
 
about in groups of two or three, talking, playing games like "Lond
 
Bridge," and drawing on blackboards. During classes the demeanor is
 
more decorous, however. Teachers expect the children to sit quietly and
 
copy lessons from the board, take dictation, or listen to each other
 
recite.
 
b
e tweeAn
taturk School is sponsored by the American-Turkish Women's
 
League, an organization affiliated with the Federation of
 
Turkish-American Societies. The women's league,  formally registered in
 
1956 in Albany, New York, was started informally by a woman educator
 
Accord i ng to
 
president,  the league has several objectives: to foster ethnic
 
awareness and knowledge in Turkish -American children, to administer
 
Ataturk School, and to further friendship and love between Turks and
 
Americans in the United States. The league currently has over two
 
hundred members, but,  as in many organizations,  the work of

The curriculum at Ataturk School is derived from books published
 
by the National Education Ministry in Turkey and monthly magazines for
 
each grade published by one of the large Turkish banks. The magazines
 
are acquired for the school by the president of the Turkish-American
 
Society. Classes use the books and magazines which are appropriate to
 
their grade level. Pupils are required to pay $1 for each book they
 
take for the year. At the end of the year they can return the books,  if
 
they wish,  and get their money back

The curriculum materials are chosen with several goals in mind.
 
Many parents and 
st ress the importance of the children's
 
7
 
impression that language instruction is the main purpose of the school.
 
Language is taught as it i
s taught to schoolchildren of comparable age
 
in Turkey--not as a second language. The fostering of ethnic pride is
 
also emphasized. To this end lessons stress the glories of Turkish
 
history, the greatness of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk â€”the founder of modern
 
Turkey â€”and the beauties of the Turkish homeland. This body of
 
knowledge, along with the ability to speak Turkish, is an important
 
marker of Turkish identity.
 
Religion has been added recently as a subject at Ataturk School.
 
To be Turkish in Turkey means to be Muslim and, when someone has
 
converted to Islam, the saying goes,  "He became a Turk.
"  Although being
 
Muslim is so closely associated with being Turkish, many educated Turks
 
do not practice religion.
 
In some classes the school day begins at 10.00 A.M. with students
 
shouting a motto after the teacher while standing at attention. It
 
starts, "I'm Turkish, upright, and hardworking,  and goes on to mention
 
defending the young, honoring the elders, loving one's people, and
 
uplifting one's nation; in other classes the call to order is more
 
subtle. A lesson is then announced and frequently written on the board
 
by the teacher, to be copied by the pupils. Lessons might be on Turkish
 
language,  "life knowledge" (customs), social studies, or history.
 
Pupils may be expected to listen to further explication by the teacher,
 
read aloud before the class, or answer questions posed by the teacher.
 
8
 
There i
s a lunch break at 1
2:00 noon. Most children bring their
 
lunch, although some parents bring in pizzas at lunchtime and have
 
their children share with their classmates. Although one teacher stays
 
upstairs in the class area on "
lunch duty," no attempt i
s made to
 
enforce orderly behavior at this time â€”short of throwing food or
 
injuring someone, most kinds of horsing around are tolerated, along
 
with the soaring noise levels. Some children go downstairs to have
 
lunch in the waiting room with the parents. Most of the lunches are
 
American-style sandwiches and drinks. There was no noticeable tendency
 
for children t
o bring Turkish-style picnic foods for lunch.
 
When classes are called back into session, lunch refuse is packed
 
away in overflowing wastebaskets and children resume a quieter
 
demeanor. Every other week the music teacher and the religion teacher
 
arrive. The school is divided in half and the two teachers alternate
 
between each half of the school. Sometimes, during the week when the
 
teachers do not come, the whole school is called together and the
 
regular teachers instruct the children in Turkish songs. For example,
 
the teachers taught the children the song "My Mother" in preparation
 
for Mother's Day. The lyrics describe an older child longing to have
 
mother hold him in her lap and sing lullabies again, like she did when
 
he was small.
 
School is let out at 3
:00 P.M. Children drift away, except for
 
those staying for the folk-dance class. About a dozen children seem to
 
be involved in the class. They were practicing for the 1
9th of May
 
celebration during the weeks I observed the school.
 
9
 
Ataturk School allows many different teaching styles. The first
 
grade teacher uses warmth, physical contact, and praise to encourage
 
the youngsters to behave well. Good work is rewarded with red ribbons
 
pinned to the children's clothing and called to the attention of anyone
 
around who might be interested. The second and third grade teachers
 
are more formal in their approach to the classroom and are more stern.
 
They use stern voice tone, scolding, and occasional ear tweaking to
 
encourage the children to settle down and do their work. Both of the
 
classrooms are set up with rows of seats facing the blackboard. The
 
fourth and fifth grade teachers are more soft spoken, but also use a
 
stern voice tone to guide the youngsters towards good behavior and good
 
work. The seats in the fourth grade class are set up in a circle and
 
those in the fifth grade are in arcs around the teacher's desk.
 
In addition to lessons that are dedicated to language learning and
 
groper Turkish etiquette, Ataturk School also provides formal occasions
 
and informal situations in which children pick up proper Turkish
 
comportment. Turks engage in a whole range of polite behaviors which
 
are unfamiliar to Americans. Greeting behaviors, including cheek and
 
hand kissing accompanied by appropriate verbal expressions, are very
 
important. Children are expected to be familiar with those gestures
 
and are required to perform them in public as signs of their
 
socialization in Turkish culture. On the final day of classes, for
 
example, one of the younger girls went around and kissed the cheeks and
 
hands of some of the "aunts" (as Turkish children are taught to address
 
adult women gathered in the waiting area off the school lobby) in a
 
10
 
formal and polite farewell. This behavior was highly praised and
 
appreciated, both by the recipients of the gesture and by the mother of
 
the girl, who beamed with pride at her daughter's good manners.
 
In addition to being able to communicate in the Turkish language,
 
being Turkish involves being familiar with Turkish history and symbols.
 
This includes especially knowledge of the history of the Turkish
 
Republic, acknowledgment of Ataturk as a cultural hero, and familiarity
 
with the geography of Turkey. Ataturk Schools provides its students
 
with this body of knowledge as well.
 
Parents
 
Ataturk School serves first-generation Turkish immigrant families
 
living in the New York metropolitan area and the Turkish consular staff
 
serving temporarily in this country. Some of the children were born in
 
the United States, others in Turkey. Many Turkish immigrants
 
represented in the school population are members of the intelligentsia
 
who came here as college students and stayed to practice professions,
 
but workers and small entrepreneurs are also present. The families
 
whose members I interviewed include several individuals with Ph.D.',
 
families in which both the father and mother have professional career
 
families in which the sole wage earner is a mechanic, building
 
1
1
 
superintendent, engineer, doctor, or diplomat, and others in which both
 
parents run a small business such as a dry cleaning establishment,
 
restaurant, or tailor shop.
 
The families interviewed exhibited differences in their commitment
 
to living in America. No one admitted that they never planned to return
 
to Turkey. Everyone had been to Turkey within the last five or six
 
years, at least as visitors. Some are in the United States with
 
short-term goals in mind such as completing an assignment from the
 
Turkish foreign ministry or educating a youngster. Others are raising
 
their families here because of favorable economic conditions, but hope
 
to return to Turkey. Among the most highly educated families are some
 
who have made a conscious decision to settle in America; but, when
 
pressed, even they do not rule out the possibility of retiring in
 
Turkey eventually.
 
My observations indicated that the most educated families are
 
most assimilated and most secure in their decision to remain in
 
America, except for those working in the diplomatic corps. The least
 
educated tend to remain more Turkish in their language and behavior, to
 
view their stay in America as an economic adaptation to difficult
 
times, and to anticipate their eventual return "home.' Many demonstrate
 
the "boxes in the closet syndrome" â€”whenever they purchase an appliance
 
they save the box, because someday it will be packed up and sent to
 
Turkey!

While school is in session, twenty or more mothers usually gather
 
in the waiting area of the lobby, where benches, chairs, and a
 
coffeepot are provided. Less than half a dozen fathers may gather at
 
the opposite end of the room from the mothers. The fathers sometimes
 
engage in conversation, sometimes read a newspaper, or just sit
 
quietly. The mothers engage in lively conversation and gossip, making
 
the occasion into an important social event. For some this is the only
 
chance they have to meet regularly with other Turkish women â€”certain]-y,
 
to sit with a whole group of them--as is common for women in Turkey to
 
do.\
Sometimes a mother brings homemade cakes for the gathering. Most
 
o
f the women who sit in the lobby are homemakers, and my impression is
 
tiat the core who come most faithfully are wives of blueâ€”collar
 
workers.  I have olso spoken to wives of professional men, however, who
 
l
ike t
o v
isit with the other mothers, at least occasionally. I did not
 
md any career women among them.
 
The talk, which is in Turkish, revolves around homemaking skills â€”
 
cooking, sewing, and shopping â€”ill health and good fortune among
 
acquaiitances, problems of adaptation to American life, and events at
 
the school. The gathering is an important clearinghouse for information
 
concerning products available, proprietors worth patronizing, housing,
 
vacations, and coping with American and Turkish institutions. It also
 
serves as an ad hoc PTA for the school. The principal regularly joins
 
the mothers for some time each week, discussing school matters and the
 
contributions expected from the parents such as preparing the
 
children's outfits and food for special events. Teachers sometimes join
 
in the conversations before and after classes.

At the end of the school day, as parents and children drift away,
 
some mothers stay to make the most of the last few moments of
 
conversation, urging their friends not to be in a rush to leave. There
 
is some Turkish-style kissing on both cheeks among the mothers at
 
parting.
 
Purposes of the School
 
The purposes of the school include socialization in Turkish
 
identity for the children, enculturation in Turkish language and world
 
view, formation of a Turkish ethnic group, and provision of a forum
 
where bicultural children can formulate their own value system.

participation in Ataturk School. Underlying all of the 
as
 is a
 
burning concern that the children acquire and retain a sense of
 
identity and ethnic pride. All are willing to give their time and
 
energy for the rewards of hearing the children speak Turkish, seeing
 
them write Turkish, and having them participate in Turkish events.
 
College-educated parents show an awareness of "identity crisis'
 
and express concern that their children formulate a sense of identity
 
and know "who they are." They feel Ataturk School can provide this for
 
their children. Less educated parents demonstrate less interest in
 
abstract identity and more concern for their children's continuation of
 
traditions that are familiar to them; they do not want to be cut off
 
14
 
from their children and their homeland by loss of the language and
 
culture. One mother, born in America and married to a Turkish-born
 
man, expressed a fear that, if she did not expose her son to an ethnic
 
education, he would one day accuse her of depriving him of his
 
birthright.
 
Turkish language acquisition for the children seems to be one of
 
the primary goals of the school. All curriculum materials are in
 
-
--
Turkish exclusively. The only classroom in which English ka frequently
 
is the first class, in which there are children
 
less familiar with Turkish. Even there an attempt is made to conduct
 
most matters in Turkish. One teacher eloquently expressed to me the
 
need for the children to be fluent in Turkish so that they would be
 
able to feel at home in Turkey. He likened Turkish children in America
 
without the Turkish language to nightingales in a gilded cage. No
 
matter how beautiful and rich the cage, the inhabitant is still not
 
free. To be free â€”to return to their homeland if they
 
wish â€”Turkish-American youngsters must have command of the Turkish
 
langua e and culture.
 
Attitudes toward
,g' the use of the Turkish language vary with the
 
education of the parents and the degree of their assimilation. Parents
 
wÂ±t  a career are more likely to report speaking English to their
 
children at home. One family, in which both parents are involved in
 
American careers, employs a Turkish housekeeper to care for the
 
children and speak Turkish with them. College-educated parents
 
emphasize the general benefits which accrue to language acquisition in
 
15
 
the business and academic world as part of their reason for sending
 
their children to Ataturk School. Since these parents are also most
 
concerned about assimilation themselves, however, they most often speak
 
English to their children, "to make sure the child understands," to
 
facilitate the child's adjustment to his American peers, or to perfect
 
their own skills in English. Wives of highly educated professionals
 
complained most to me about their inadequate English; they speak
 
English better than the other mothers, but not as well as their
 
husbands. One blue-collar mother reports speaking Turkish to her
 
children at home because her ethnic neighbors told her that, if she did
 
not, her children would lose the language, as theirs had. She feels
 
that she is sacrificing her own opportunity to learn English better for
 
the good of her children.

as a more broad-reaching vision for the
 
school. She sees it not only as a language-teaching institutiqp-"and
 
link between Turkish-American children and their homeland /but also as
 
a fosterer of a Turkish ethnic presence in the United States. Fully
 
aware of the small number of Turks living in this country, she is
 
concerned that they be able to unite and make their voice heard and
 
respected. She expects that creating Turkish-conscious youngsters who
 
are educ ted and aware will contribute to this cause. The children, she

Students
 
There is a difference between the children and their parents over
 
the issue of staying in America permanently. Although many youngsters
 
professed insecurity about their future in this country, most indicated
 
quite strongly that they want to spend the rest of their lives here. No
 
child showed any reluctance to assimilate, to speak English, hav
 
American friends, dress in American clothes, and enjoy American fo
 
This includes children of the consular staff. On the other hand, some
 
children did show a reluctance to stress Turkish behaviors, including
 
use of the Turkish language; but none seemed eager to forget about
 
being Turkish altogether.
 
The children, like children in most ethnic schools, profess little
 
interest in the issues of such burning importance to their elders, and
 
most would rather be doing something else on Saturday. Boys especially
 
are eager to disclaim any interest at all in their Turkish studies, to
 
assure me that they are hostage to their parents, and to underscore the
 
point that they are "made to come to this school." Most children
 
believe that they are at the school to learn Turkish because their
 
parents do not think that they know the language well enough. The
 
children feel that they do know the language and that they get along
 
fine when they visit Turkey. They do not see the need for learning all
 
the history and social studies, singing, and religion taught at the
 
school. Many who feel unhappy about the school give boredom as their
 
1
7
 
reason. Most also feel bored with their public school education,
 
although some make distinctions between the two. Several girls did feel
 
free to tell me that they enjoy Ataturk School, they l
ike learning
 
Turkish better, and find Turkish history interesting.
 
The children I spoke with have American friends where they l
ive
 
and do not especially seek out Turks, even when
 
school, unless their families carry on relations
 
families. Some of the children have acquired Americanized nicknames.
 
When asked if they share their Turkish culture with their American
 
friends, more than one child told me that their friends tease them when
 
they act or appear Turkish, and that they want to pass as any other
 
American. Some play on softball or soccer teams, take music lessons, or
 
belong to a YMCA with their American friends. When extracurricular
 
activities conflict with attendance at Ataturk School, sometimes
 
attendance at the school
 One girl told me that she had
 
missed several Saturdays because of softball.
 
Aked what they like best about the school, many children
 
responded "
lunch" or "fooling around with my friends," which indicates
 
that, even for the disaffected, the school holds the pleasure of
 
associating with other Turkish-American youngsters in the same
 
situation. Since the children come from such scattered homes, school
 
provides the only regular opportunity for some students to be in a
 
gathering of Turks, to feel that they are not alone or weird, and to
 
create a culture of shared Turkish-American experience.

Conclusions
 
It i
s clear that Ataturk School is engaged in creating
 
maintaining ethnic identity for children of Turkish parents
 
America, whether they are permanent residents, staying here
 
and
 
residing in
 
temporarily
 
to raise their families, or on a tour of duty. There are two main
 
aspects to the school's function:  1
) the sharing of a body of knowledge
 
which Turks acknowledge as their own and which serves as a marker of
 
Turkish identity; and 2) the provision of social space where thcir
 '
-
"Turkish-ness" can be acted out, mannerisms and language oan--be
 
Turkish norm (or.at least a Turkish-American
 
one), and 9o
.1ida jt
ean-b?_expressedï¿½wi
 an a p'reciative audience.
 
The end product of both functions is an ethnic group capable of
 
behaving as an interest group. This idea has been expressed in
 
scholarly literature by Anya Royce4/and from the lay perspective by
 
4 '
 
Mrs. Ozdil (see above).

By teaching Turkish as a mother

language and not as a second language, thereby avoiding much direct
 
translation, Ataturk School operates within the Turkish world view and
 
passes it on to the children.
 
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the first president of modern Turkey, is
 
the school's namesake and hero. The mothers' waiting area is dominated
 
by a mural depicting Ataturk's great humanism and quoting his wise
 
sayings. The holidays celebrated throughout the school year were mostly
 
established by Ataturk. On those occasions the children recite his
 
orations, sing songs glorifying his achievements, and listen to
 
speeches which hold him up as a great man to be emulated and revered.

Concerning the religious component in
 
Mrs. Karc1o lu told me that parents at the
 
religion taught because they are aware of
 
the school's curriculum,
 
school wished to have
 
the saliency of religion as a
 
determinant of identity in America. In other words, religion, which for
 
20
 
some would not be stressed as an important element of identity in
 
Turkey, where nearly everyone is born into the same religion, becomes
 
stressed in America, where religion is often a component of ethnic
 
identity and sometimes even stands alone as a label or designator of
 
group affiliation, e.g., Catholic, Protestant, or Jew. Some parents,
 
especially those who are most educated and would have stressed religion
 
least in Turkey, feel that their children are getting more religious
 
training here than they would have in Turkey because of the inclusion
 
of religion in the school curriculum. As in Turkey, however, religion
 
i
s an optional subject.
 
Although there are parents at Ataturk School who carry over their
 
secularism to the point of celebrating Christmas for their children as
 
a seasonal holiday, others take advantage of the winter holiday season
 
to impress their Turkish identity on their children. One parent
 
pointed out that her child's exposure to Judaism as an acceptable
 
alternative to Christianity in America made it easier for her to
 
present Islam as yet another alternative, and the only appropriate one
 
for Turks like themselves to espouse. Whether or not they practice
 
Islam, children at the school
 a body of religious
 
knowledge which reinforces their sense of being Turkish and
 
differentiates them from other Americans.
 
Quite apart from the curriculum, Ataturk School is an important
 
source of Turkish identification as a center where Turks can gather and
 
act Turkish. More than one mother acknowledged that, although the
 
2
1
 
manifest purpose of bringing her child to the school i
s to improve his
 
or her knowledge of Turkish, the more compelling reason is to socialize
 
with the other mothers.
 
In-gathering is also very important for the establishment and
 
perpetuation of group norms and values. A reference group provides
 
standards against which members measure their self-worth and succe
.n
 
The mothers and children who gather regularly at Ataturk School s
'
 
out acceptable and unacceptable behaviors for group members on the
 
basis of the interactions in which they participate. "Turkish"
 
behaviors â€”the use of Turkish language, gestures, and greetings â€”are
 
highly rewarded, while un-Turkish behaviors â€”refusing to sit and visit,
 
or the use of English â€”are either sharply criticized or ignored. Career
 
mothers may avoid the gathering not only because it consumes so much
 
time but also because they do not live up to the standards of
 
traditional Turkish womanhood that are manifested there. If so, the
 
absence of career mothers is an excellent example of the power of
 
in-gathering to set group standards and eliminate non-conforming
 
behavi r.
 
Besides providing a srPne_xkazq Turkish in-group behavior e n be
 
honed and developed for Turkish-Americans, Ataturk School provides a
 
focus for Turks in the area, who are otherwise divided in their
 
loyalties by their socio-economic status, sub-ethnic interests, and
 
commitment to assimilation in the United States. One father pointed out
 
that, although the Turkish-American community has become fragmented
 
during the past few years by the proliferation of associations formed
 
22
 
by Turkish interest groups7, the members of many of the groups support
 
c

Ataturk School. Children at the school a -exposed, therefore, to a
 
cross section of Turkish society in the United SfS
'tes. The mutual
 
agreement on the part of many groups to submit their children to a
 
single curriculum means that there is a common denominator of
 
Turkish culture shared by all.
 
For the children Ataturk School is the one place they experience a
 
large number of Turks 
_congregating in a limited space on a regular
 
basis Ylt may be the one place outside their home for some of them
 
/
 
/
 
where their Turkish identity i
s salient and where they get a chance to
 
practice it. The inclusion in the student body of the children of
 
consular staff, "Turkish Turks" (as opposed to "American Turks"),
 
further emphasizes the fact that Ataturk is a school for Turkish
 
children. It also brings out the commonality between the children born
 
in America and their Turkish brethren.
 
Of greater significance for the children, however, is the fact
 
that Ataturk School is not only a place to learn about Turkish culture
 
and behavior but also an arena in which they can act out the tensions
 
involved in being bicultural. Many children spend most of the week
 
ignoring or even denying their differences from other American
 
children, at least in public. Several told me that there is no
 
opportunity at their public schools to share aspects of their ethnic
 
heritage with other children, and several boys assured me that their
 
American friends teased them mercilessly if they let slip a Turkish-ism
 
23
 
in their behavior. Some have American nicknames to mask their Turkish
 
names. Yet these very same children will fight, if necessary,  to
 
protect the good name of Turks.
 
/
 
The tension involved in being bicultural is- par-ly-act
- &'-eii.  In
 
th tdisplay of dislike for Ataturk School by many of the children. The
 
children tell me that they are "Turkish enough" and have no use for
 
the enculturation they experience at the school. They are highly
 
sensitive about their Turkish-ness; they do not enjoy having it "rubbed
 
in." One boy provided a clue to the noisy negative feelings expressed
 
by the children by telling me that he would really like to go to a
 
Turkish school in Turkey, but that his parents told him that it is too
 
expensive. He seems to be saying that he would like to be all Turkish
 
in Turkey, or all American in America, but that being both is a strain.
 
After trying all week to be just like any other American kid, it must
 
be difficult for the youngsters to "turn on" Turkish on Saturdays. The
 
one adult I interviewed who could look back on such an experience
 
herself, however, says that she appreciated it and

same experience. Perhaps one of the greatest services
 
Ataturk School offers the children is an opportunity to vent their
 
negative feelings to each other in a safe environment. These feelings,
 
w ich would be anti-Turkish if shared with American friends or Turkish
 
parents, become part of the culture of Turkish
'
A
mericanism. Ataturk
 
School is wise to provide the students with a relatively unsupervised
 
lunch period during which the children can discharge the tensions they
 
/
 
24
 
feel in a situation in which mutual support and understanding is
 
possible and they-a

figures.
 
If the manifest function of Ataturk School is to socialize
 
children as Turks, one of the important latent functions is to provide
 
an organized vehicle for the formulation of a Turkish-American culture.
 
Americanisms in the children's dress (blue jeans and sneakers for
 
many), food (
pizza), and use of Turkish language (
"I ate breakfast"
 
rather than "
I did or made breakfast" which is idiomatic) are readily
 
accepted. Children are prilid 4

own values and experiences. The formal structure of the school i

It has been estimated that there were fewer than 100,000 Turks in the

engineers and doctors, have been immigrating during the past twenty
 
years. Although there is a plethora of Turkish organizations in the
