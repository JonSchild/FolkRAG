The Dope Fiend
THE DOPE FIEND 4138 B2
Jim Hurlbert Visalia, 1940
I just dropped in to tell you boys I'm ragged but right I'm a thief and a dope fiend and I'm
lit up every night It's three porterhouse steaks each time of day for my board That's more
than any flat foot in your town can afford.
A big electric fan to keep me cool while I sleep A purty little woman just to tickle my feet I'm
a rambler, a gambler, I'm lit up every night, I'm a rootin'-tootin' dope fiend, but bright.
