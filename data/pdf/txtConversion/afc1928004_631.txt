father ( who would have hided mni 
i, tne auspicious day came, 
and 
he got the promise of an engagement. 
As UA.S was a 
great event in 
his life. he had to make suitable prep-nation as regards his suit to 
be worn on the occasion. 
Th s 
was rianta a difficult matter, being 
without funds, and only possessed of a 
pair of hob- nailed shoes; he 
determined to turn Up his pants and sew patches upon them; and 
to carry this out mibe,:nowit to his folks, cencealed himself under a 
pier and effected it by becoming his own tailor. 
At length the night 
canie, and with a 
vast. amount of nervousness. but a 
strong deter-
ininai ion, he made his first appearance. as described, with a 
stiff 
stantlim.; collar, on which had been spent about a 
pound of starch. 
by his mother, and which altuost sawed his ears off. in the song and 
dance—" Cunt Plum!: Gum "— and was a 
great success, being received 
with vociferous applause; and his future career was fixed. 
He must 
be a 
song and dance man; and so his first appeal auce closed without 
any mishap excelaing that the emit was hard to get off his face, 
an,1 out of Its eyes and ears, where it would persist in remaining as 
tel.-taai of his actions. 
His second appearance was at Greenpoint. a 
short time after, In 
the same song and daece. 
Rat this did not have quite as happy a 
ternination. Somehow paterfamilias got wind of it. and arming

father in the boat at Greenpoint, and dodged back to 
avoid him, going through the ladies' cabin; but here he calculated 
without his host, for a 
friend of the father had been stationed there, 
and he was duly nabbed, and given over to the clutches of his 
Lather. 
After a 
sort of go-as you-please race between him and his 
sire; who threatened the rest of the party if they interfered, Tommy 
was taken home a 
prisoner, with the promise of a 
sound thrashing, 
which he would have duly received had it not have been for his 
grandmother, who burst open the door and prevented it. as all good 
grandmothers usually do. 
Tommy now rested for a 
while, the fever 
being off a 
little, soon to burst out with ten- fold force. 
Tommy 
being resolved not to be " Cum flung Gutted" any more, deter-
mined to find new fields in the future for his operations, and there-
fore arranged with a 
pal to go to Philadelphia, and accordingly, 
ing a 
Lincoln and Hamlin badge (this was in 1863) to raise money to 
get across the ferry to Jersey City. 
But here the companion caved, 
and hid himself away from our hero, who got on bcard a 
car, hiding 
under a 
seat, where two soldiers covered him up with a blanket, 
arriving at the Hensington Depot at Philadelphia at dark. Tommy 
was somewhat scared, and made his way somehow to West Phila-
delphia, and getting on board a 
car came back, much in the same 
way as he went. He arrived home the next morning, his escapade 
being, as usual, hidden by his grandmother. Tommy now rested 
for a 
while; but the next year, 1664, the fever broke out again, and 
having tasted the pleasures of traveling, even though surreptit iously, 
and in the same manner got to the brotherly city, this time to stop. 
He applied at once to the Canterbury Music Hall, telling the propri-
etor that a 
party had told him he was in want of a 
song andi dance 
i
ce 
man; the man gave him a 
trial that night, and engaged bn a  
sort of jobbing utility man, to deliver bills in front of the hall, tend 
bar, and occasionally black up and go on to fill up. 
Here he re-
mained twelve months, becoming a 
general favorite. 
Here he first 
sang the song of the " Ham Fat Man," with great success; alsb 
others. Tommy was also a 
favorite out of doors as well as on the 
stage; the proprietor utilizing him as bar-tender for another house. 
This man wa. a 
substitute runner, and made piles of money. At 
length he sold out, going to England, wanting our hero to go with 
him; but he declined. 
Had he gone the whole tenor of his life 
might have changed. 
Tommy now resolved to go to Pittsburg in search of a 
professional 
friend. 
Having rigged himself out with new clothes, etc., he had 
very little money left for fare, and determined to beat his way 
there. He had a 
bottle of brandy in his valise; getting on the cars, 
on the coming round of the conductor for tickets, Tom with a piti-
able story told him he had no money. offering him the bottle of 
Cogniac; of course at first the conductor was indignant, and threat-
ened to put him off, but finally gave in and accepted it, taking 
Tommy to Pittsburg, where he found his friend had been gone away 
just one hour. In a strange city, without money and friends, he 
was lucky enough to secure an engagement with Mr. Fred Aims, 
manager of Melodeon Theatre, at present Academy of Music. 
In 
the meantime, becoming a pupil of Mr. Denny Gallagher, of tho 
well-known firm of Mulligan. Leavitt and Gallagher, then the inim-
itable Ethiopian trio—concluded a 
prosperous season as pupil of the 
above gentleman. This was in the year 1865; the following year he 
played at all the leading vaudeville theatres of Philadelphia, the 
following performers being members of some of the different com-
panies: Jim Flake, Annie Rush, Ililly Chambers and Sheeny Keen. 
During the above career Tommy's folks thought him dead; but in 
,1867 he returned to New York, dressed in the height of fashion, with 
i&POCket well filled with money; his old companions congratulating 
5 
him upon his success. 
However, it soon reached his folks' ears 
that their boy was still alive, and at present in the neighbosrehoro
ct 
k 
oTommy's father, mother, brother, aunt and uncle went, in a 
of him. Tommy hearing of this, left the city at once for Philadel-
phia. 
Letters passed between him and his folks, and everything 
was amicably settled, his folks consenting to let him follow his 
-'chosen profession. 
He left for Washington and joined Charles 
Holly (now in Australia), appearing in double clog and song & 
dance with Campbell Minstrels, of which John Hart and Joe Mor-
timore were members; assumed the name of Keystone Boys--
Winnett and Holly—and played protracted engagements with Sam 
Sandford's Minstrels, Skiff and Gaylord's Minstrels, Kurkel's Night-
ingale Serenaders, Hooley's Minstrels, etc.; dissolved partnership 
with Charles Holly July 10th, 1867. 
The next year, 1868, sr-iled for 
Havana, Cuba. and played profitable engagements on that island. 
Left Cuba for New Orleans, then Mobile, St. Louis, and all the prin-
cipal cities of America, appearing in black face, contortion, and 
high- kicking songs and dances, and always meeting with supreme 
superlative success; and at intervals appearing in an inimitable 
American clog dance, which never failed to elicit hearty applause. 
This was in the years ' 69, ' 70, and ' 71. 
Was married in the year 
187;2 to Miss Levina Wilson, now Mrs. Thomas H. tl'innett; appeared 
in double jig dance for the first time at Opera House. Dayton, Ohio, 
March, 187:4i first time in Dutch song and dance in Cincinnati, Ohio, 
April, same year, billing as the Winnetts—Thothas and Lottie. 
During the succeeding years he appeared at the principal theatres 
and cities in German musical sketches, specialties, dances, etc., with 
uninterrupted success. 
The Winnetts' untiring ambition and energy 
have placed them in the front rank of their profession. 
Miss Lorrik W INNETT, actress. comedienne, and specialist, was 
born in Thornhill, Canada, twelve miles from Toronto, Canada, 
August 15th, 1853; made her first appearance before the public at 
Dayton, Ohio, in a 
dancing specialty, and as Rosa in the comedy of 
" 
Where's Yactip?" in the month of March, 1873. 
Also appearing, 
for the first time. in German sketch. as Katarina, assisted by T. H. 
Winnett as Fritz, in Cincinnati, Ohio, April, same year. 
It is but 
, justice to say that the Win netts were the first double male and fe-
male jig dancers in America; and their sketches, specialties, etc., 
,) are entirely original and first•class. and likewise their imitation ot

MOONLIGHT IN THE GARDEN. 
W ritten by THOMAS H. 
W INNETT, expressly for Miss LOTTIB 
WINNETT, the star of conspicuous brilliancy. 
While strolling in the garden, 
Meandering at my ease, 
Watching all the little stars 
A peeping through the trees, 
The shadow of a 
form appeared 
Before me in the grass, 
And quickly looking up I 
saw 
A darling gent who stood right in my path., 
Cnonus. 
He had the sweetest smile, 
And such bewitching style, 
He said I 
was his be: u-y, 
And I 
never would regret 
If I 
would only marry hint 
And always be his darling little pet. 
We reclined upon a 
rustic, 
Among flowers sweet perfume, 
We laughed and talked and frolicked, 
By the light of the silvery moon, 
His arms entwined around my waist, 
In kissing did persist, 
I 
never will forget the happy time 
When his sweet lips they stole from me a 
kiss. 
He had the, eta.

"GIPSY," MY LITTLE BLACK AND TAN. 
Dedicated to the AVinnett's black and tan, " GIPSY," the 
popular and favorite professional canine. 
Of all the friends that I 
have had— 
Or friends they seem to be— 
They left me when reverses came, 
Save one who stayed by me. 
The friend that I 
am speaking of 
is neither child nor man— 
It is my faithful " Gip " at home, 
My little black and tan. 
No matter where I 
wander to, 
No matter where I 
roam, 
I 
know I 
have at least one friend— 
My little dog at home. 
I 
love to hear his playful bark, 
He's truer friend than man; 
No one can take his love from me, 
My little black and tan. 
He knows my step upon the walk, 
He also knows my rap, 
And when I 
sit down in the house, 
Be hops into my lap, 
And when his shining eyes meet mine— 
For speak they almost can— 
I 
see true friendship beaming forth, 
My little black and tan. 
Now chide me not for loving him, 
For love him I 
will do; 
Of all the friends that I 
have had, 
Alone he has been true, • 
He does not leave Inc though I'm poor, 
He loves me better than 
The ones that left me in distress— 
Jay " Gipsy," black and tan.

THE MINSTREL'S LAMENT. 
Recited by THOS. H. 
W INNETT. Written by BOBBY NEWCOMB. 
The subjoined poem was suggested by the following circum-
stances: 
Of course everybody knows genial ** Jimmy Quinn." 
who is not the thinnest man in the universe. " Jimmy is fond of 
good living, and can also sleep about as well as anybody. 
While 
performing in Worcester, Mass., recently, he overslept himself, 
,and came very near missing the train on which the c4 iii 
arty ( earn-
cross & Dixey's Minstrels) departed, and it was only by that hurried 
suggestion of Mr. Carncross and a 
vigorous application of the whip 
to a 
pair of black horses, that he was brought to the depot in 
time. 
JIMMY QUINN'S RIDE. 
The lowering clouds gave sign of snow 
When Quinn unto his couch did go, 
And thought of naught save the morning meal, 
For which a 
cravin., he did feel. 
All through the night he slumbered well, 
But, to be called at eight forgot to tell. 
The clerk who knew, by the break of day, 
That Quinn from the depot was miles away. 
The company were soon on the march; 
Their eyes beheld the railway arch, 
And thought not of Quinn, who slumbered still, 
And snored like the noise of a 
rolling-mill. 
What means this alarm --' tis a 
fearful cry! 
Where, where is Quinn, with his bright blue eye? 
"We:Ire ready to start— Oh! where is he? 
Say ? 
A. voice replied : ‘• Quinn's five miles away!" 
The Quinering steeds pranced through the snow, 
o 
When there Caine an order for them to go 
And fetch back Quinn, our jolly old pal; 
• 
And be sore the price came out of his " sal.'' 
0, steeds, with brightly shining coats, 
Flurry him on -- thy portion's oats. 
With one aecord they dashed like spray, 
For Quinn was yet live miles away! 
What is the speck on the horizon clear? 
What means the sound of that boisterous cheer? 
'Tis the horses returning with leap and bound; 
For " Quinny," without his breakfast, they've found. 
Hurrah hurrah! for the steeds so true; 
Hurrah for Quinn! who with cold was blue: 
_Hurrah! hurrah ! he has gained the day. 
Brit a 
clinch and a. half will have to Rty.

MUSIC IN EVERYTHING. 
As recited by THOMAS and LOTTIE W INNETT. 
MR. 
SIMNIONS.—Do you know, Mr. Coons, there's 
music in everything? 
M R. COONS.— They say music has power. 
M R. SIMMONS.—Yes; there's a 
powerful lot of mu-
sic in everything. 
Wine rill make you hum. 
M R. COONS.--Yes; it's often made you hum. 
M R. SIMMONS.—And I've seen you so full of it you 
couldn't get home. 
COONS.—You'll have to whine ( wine) a long 
time before you get enough of it to get full again. 
Mu. SIMM ) NS. 
never get drunk on benzine. 
Mu. COONS.— And why not? 
SIMMONS.—Because I know a man that got 
drunk about ten years ago on benzine and he has 
not benzine ( been seen) since. 
But talking about 
music, I 
can prove my assertion that there is music 
in nearly everything, 
COONS.--Well, sir, let us hear you prove it. 
M R. SIMMONS: 
There's music in a 
scolding wife 
Who keeps the house in; 
There's in tisk, in a 
mosquito, 
Or the tiling of a 
saw; 
There's intpic in a 
sprawling brat 
At any hour of night, 
And there's musie in a 
Thomas cat 
Preparing for a 
light; 
There's music in a 
dinner- horn, 
There's music ill a 
kitt le, 
TherJ's inusic in 
our knife and fork 
When you eat your \ ictuals, 
There's music in a 
bumble bee, 
Or a 
hug that flies about, 
And t 
h 
,re's musie in my Mary Ann, 
But (Oat woat) it's hard to bring it out.

RAGGED JACKET. 
A 
decided success by the W INNETT's in the principa/ 
Theater's of America, 
Although I 
am a 
poor boy, 
And live by honest labor, 
Of fortune's share I've some to spare, 
To assist a 
needing neighbor_ 
Content and health is all my wealth, 
With honesty to back it. 
My meaning is good, although I 
arv. poor, , 
I 
respect a 
ragged jacket; 
Let people say what e're they may 
Of fortune and its waivers, 
Its not the coat that makes the man, 
But the deeds through life which bears it. 
All men were equal born at first, 
In this and every nation, 
The rich among the poor would be, 
But .for wealth and education; 
But when we're laid beneath the sod, 
With a 
hundred years to back it, 
There's none can tell which were the bones, 
That wore the ragged jacket.

WHAT l 
LIVE FOR. 
Dedicated to Miss LOTTIE W INNETT by THOS. H. 
W INNETT, 
the versatile artist. 
I 
live for those who love me, 
For those whose hearts are true, 
For the heaven that smiles above me 
And awaits my spirit, too; 
For all human ties that bind me, 
For the task my God assigned me, 
For the bright hopes left behind me, 
And the goad that I 
can do. 
I 
live to learn their story 
Who've suffered for my sake, 
To emulate their glory 
And follow in their wake— 
Bards, martyrs, patriots, sages, 
The noble of all ages, 
Whose deeds crown history's pages, 
And the time great volume make. 
I 
live to hold communion 
With all that is divine, 
To feel that there is union 
"rwixt nature's heart and mine, 
To profit by affliction, 
Reap truth from fields of fiction, 
Grow wiser from conviction— 
Fulfilling God's design. 
I 
live for those that love me, 
For those whose hearts are true, 
For the heaven that smiles above me, 
And waits my spirit, too; 
For the wrongs that need resistance, 
For the cause that needs assistance, 
For the future in the distance, 
And the good that I 
can do.

THE KISS. 
Recited by Miss LOTTIE W INNETT. 
You hissA me, and my heart dropped low on your 
breast, 
With a 
feeling of shelter and infinite rest. 
While the holy emotion my tongue could not speak, 
Flashed 
up like a flame from my heart to my 
cheek 
Your arms held me fast, your arms were so bold 
Heart responded to heart in the passionatt, fold, 
And your glances seemed drawing my heart front 
mine eyes, 
As the sun draws the mist from the seas to the 
skies, 
And your lips clung to mine till I 
prayed in my bliss, 
They might never unclasp front that raptures kiss. 
You kissed me—my heart and my soul, and my will, 
In delirous joy for the moment stood still, 
Life had for me then no temptations, no charms, 
of pleasure, outside or your arms, 
And were I 
this moment an angel, possessed 
Of the joy and the peace that is given the blessed, 
I'd lay my white robe unreposingly down 
And tear from my forehead its beautiful crown, 
To nestle once more in that heaven of rest, 
'With your lips pressed to mine and my head on 
your breast. 
You kissed me, my soul in the bliss so divine. 
Reeled and swoon like a drunken man, drunken 
with wine, 
And thought it were delicious to die there, if death 
-Would cone while my lips were still 
moist with 
thy breath', 
'Twere delicious to die, if my heart might grow cold, 
While your arms clasp d 
me close in that passion-
ate fold, 
And these are the questions I 
ask day and night, 
"Must my lips know but, one such exquisite de-
light, 
And would you love me if

THE MAN AT THE DOOR. 
As recited at a 
Professional Social Circle by 'Dios. H. 
W IN141iTT, 
meeting with hilarious greeting. 
No doubt you have often felt angry 
At the check- taker's manner so tough, 
And perhaps in your mind you have culled Wit 
Uncivil, uncouth, and a 
rough; 
But, friends, do not judge hint too harshly, 
Of troubles he has a 
full store; 
Let me show you a 
few of the people 
Who bother the man at the door. 
The first is that time honored party 
Who one season was out with Dan Rice— 
His clothes are remarkably seedy, 
And he has on a 
fearful bad " dice," 
And he says that Dan liked him immensely, 
And wanted him three seasons more, 
And, if he's not given a 
free pass, 
lie curses the man at the door. 
Then the janitor's family waltzes up, 
Some sixteen or seventeen strong, 
With a 
cheek that is simply amazing:, 
They expeet him to pass them along; 
They say that hi all of their lifetime 
They have never been turned off before. 
And freely expres their opinion 
Of that horrible man at the door. 
The next, with a 
sweet smile, inquires: 
Say, cull, do you pass the profesh? 
A 
disinterested observer 
Might call him decidedly fresh.

-THE MAN AT THE DOOR. 
(Concluded). 
I'm here on a 
little vacation, 
Worked steady for five years or more, 
Advance-agent told me to mention 
My name to the man at the door. 
Then a 
tall, ministerial party, 
With a 
sober and dignified air, 
Announces himself as the pastor 
Of the church on the opposite square; 
He's not very fond of amusement 
But his family, numbering four, 
Were anxious to come, so he asks for 
A r),= from the man at the doer. 
And se, every night of the season, 
They pester the suffering one— 
Bad actors, bill posters, and draymen— 
Don't think for a 
moment 't 
is fun; 
City fathers, and leindlords. and hackmen, 
Railroadmen flocking up by the score, 
All expecting to surely get " comps" from 
This much- abused man at, the door. 
So. friends, when you're tempted to blame hias 
For answering you impolite, 
Just think of I 
he troubles and trials 
Which emne to him night after night; 
Don't call him uncivil mid surly, 
Don't call him an unmanly boor— 
Itemernher the hundreds of dead- beats 
Who bother the man at the door.

WHEN THE GHOST WALKS. 
T5e above title answers to the day the manager liquidates to 
his performers (salary day), compensating them 
for their weekly services. 
Written by GULICK. 
Recited by li.TINNErr. 
Theaactor comes to the concert hall; 
He hangs his wardrobe on the Nvall, 
And as he " corks " his smiling face 
He says to the actors in the place: 
" 
What day does the ghost walk?" 
On -Wednesday, after the matinee, 
The ghost walks; that's what the actors say; 
And he smiles and 'glad is his heart and soul 
As he thinks of what he'll do with his roll 
When the ghost walks. 
Now he blacks his face up every night, 
And makes the people laugh- -that's right; 
And Monday comes as it did before, 
And he says it's only two days more. 
Till the ghost walks. 
Now the landlord of " ye hash foundry" 
Stops ye " actor man," and with a 
sigh 
Says where is the pay for your daily peck? 
But the actor says " that you can't expect, 
Till the ghost walks." 
And the lady of color, who washes his clothes, 
Demands her lucre—impatient grows; 
And she holds his togs, though he cloth say 
" 
l'll pay your bill next Wed-nes-day, 
When the ghost walks." 
Now Wednesday comes and " the main guy" skips, 
Perchance on one of his pleasure trips, 
And the actor's face looks awfully worriel 
As soon as he hears " the manager's sherried," 
And " the ghost won't walk." 
And the landlord won't give up the trunk, 
And the washerwoman keeps his clothes (that's 
spunk), 
And the " ghost didn't walk," he says with a 
frown, 
So I 
guess l'll have to walk out of town, 
\ And walking's bad."

A MOTTO FOR ALL. 
Sung only by the inimitable M ISS LOME W INNErr, the 
leading light of the American stage. 
When a 
little girl I 
went to school, 
It seemed quite hard to me, 
My parents thought likewise, my friends, 
A bright scholar 1 
would be. 
I 
spent my time in idleness, 
In mischief's path I 
tread, 
While others with pride would persevere, 
And was prompted to the head. 
CHORUS. 
Push to the head! 
Push to the head! 
Toil we all must for our daily bread; 
It's a 
motto for all, single or wed, 
Be honest and patient 
And you'll push to the head. 
My schooldays soon were passed and gone, 
how oft did I 
repent 
The opportunities I 
once had 
If to learn was my intent. 
How useful would good knowledge be, 
If by kind advice I 
was lead, 
And used my utmost energies 
To be promoted to the head. 
Push to the head, etc.

LISTEN TO THE DINNER BELL. 
Parody on" The Water Mill:" . 
Written by BEN COLLINS, delivered by Taos. II. W INNETT, 
the popular character actor. 
Listen to the dinner bell, at twelve o'clock each day, 
How the boarders shout, hurrah! to the dh,ing room, 
hurry away. 
The proprietor looks pale and sick, as they all sit 
down to eat. 
Although, looking, be cannot tell which one 1113 
board will beat. 
Here! pass that onion butter, one of the boarders, 
said. 
The mill cannot grind if I 
don't get any bread. 
What a 
liard and hungry lot those boarders seem to be 
How they grasp and gormandize everything they see, 
They were never known to stop, unless they had 
their fill. 
After coming back again to that corn beef mill. 
Truly speaks the landlord, my clothes are fading fast. 
I cannot wash my ulster with the water that has 
passed. 
Take this lesson to yourself, but don't take anything 
23 
LISTEN TO THE DINNER BELL 
(Concluded). 
Pay your board, leave my house or 
fire you out 
of the door. 
You want your trunk! I 
want my money! 
I've trusted you long enough! 
I 
know you well, you can't fool me, 
And say my turkey's tough. 
Go to the Black Hills and dig for Indians, 
You may come back in silk, 
But the mill can never grind 
With the water that's in the milk. 
Oh! what waste in a 
boarding house, 
What bills you have to pay, 
A dead beat will sure come back again, 
Cause he couldn't stay away. 
Some will ask for a 
fire-escape, 
And more an elevator, 
And want their dollar diamond rings 
Placed in a 
refrigerator. 
Take this lesson to your heart, 
Before you bring in your trunk, 
The coffee mill can never grind, 
When the cook is on a 
drunk. 
MORA.L—And the boarder took up his grip sack, 
left the " peck," and sherried. Which way did he go, 
Danger Norton remarks, toward Mt. Clemmens.

GAMBLER'S W I 
FE. 
Recited by MISS LOTTIE W INNETT, in the successful play, 
"Restored to Life." 
Dark is the night; how dark; no light, no fire; 
Cold, on the hearth, the last faint sparks expire; 
Shivering, she watches, by the cradle side, 
For him, who pledged her love—last year a 
bride. 
Hark! ' tis his footstep! 
No, ' tis past, ' tis gone! 
Tick, tick—how wearily the tune moves on, 
Can he desert me, thus? 
He once was kind, 
And I 
believed ' twould last. 
How mad how blind! 
Rest thee, my babe, rest on; ' tis hunger's cry; 
Sleep, for there's no food— the fount is dry, 
Famine and cold their wearying work have done, 
My heart must break; and then—the clock strikes one. 
Hush! ' tis the ( ice-box! 
Yes, he's there! he's there! 
For this—he leaves me to despair; 
Leaves love; leaves truth; his wife, his child. 
For what? 
The wanton's smile, the villain and the sot. 
Yet I'll not curse him. 
No, ' tis all in vain, 
Tis long to wait, but, sure, he'll come again, 
And I 
could starve, and bless hint, but for you, 
My child—his child! 
Oh, fiend—the clock strikes two. 
Hark! how the sign- boards creaks. 
The blast howls by. 
Moan, moan, ye \Inds, through the cloudy sky. 
ha! ' tis his knock; he conies—he comes once more; 
No, 'tis but the lattice- flaps. 
My hope is o'er. 
Can he desert me thus? 
He knows I 
stay 
Night after night, in loneliness, to pray 
For his return—and yet he sees no tear; 
No, no, it cannot be; he will be here. 
Nestle more closely, dear on ,', to my heart, 
Thou'rt cold; thou'rt fruezing; but we will not part. 
Husband, I 
die. 
Father ! it is not he— 
Oh. God! protect my child—the clock strikes three. 
They're gone! the glimmering spark bath fled, 
The wife and child are number'd with the dead; 
On the cold hearth, outstreteli'd in solemn rest, 
The babe lay, frozen on its mother's breast. 
The gambler came at last, lint all was o'er, 
Dread silence reigned around—the clock struck four.

DRINK AND ITS INFLUENCI?: 
*humorous recitation, recited by all tlin leading 
Irish comedians. 
In a 
tenement brick, 
Where the families were thick, 
Lived McMullin, a 
poor little tailor, 
Although he was small, 
At a 
party or ball 
He was nimble and light as a 
sailor. 
As a 
man lie was quiet 
Kept out of a 
riot, 
His nose was red as a 
pink, 
And when he was full 
lie was iike a 
mad bull— 
From the controlling influence of drink. 
When the war begun 
He followed the drum 
In the Sixtpninth Regiment, a 
soldier, 
lie went to the front, 
The rebels to hunt, 
The devil a 
trooper more bolder. 
When he marched to the fight 
McMullin was tight, 
He never took time to think; 
He was shot in the head, 
And left there for dead— 
From the controlling influence of drink.. 
McMullin had pluck, 
That's no use without luck, 
And, when they sent hint to cook for the nagers, 
His spirit arose, 
He put his thumb to his nose, 
saying, l'll see you in h-- 
first, be jabot.% 
In a 
cell he was put— 
Twenty- two pounds to the link— 
When they let him go, 
Oh, his health was so low— 
From the controlling influence of drink.

For that's what the tailor is ailing; 
He swallowed a

His life was beginning to sink; 
More gill, then, he cried,

From the controlling influence of drink.

That rolled in at the wake

To take a 
last look at him 
'Who'd a 
smile on his face like a 
fairy; 
Wid sobs and wid sighs, 
And tears in their eyes, 
They gave one another the wink, 
And, slotthering, said, 
l'm to \‘ ld that he's dead--
Front the controlling influence of drink. 
There's a 
nate little spot, 
Beyant in a 
Calvary lot, 
'Where the poor little tailor was buried, 
And carriages tine, 
And sogers in line, 
And a 
boat 'cross the river was ferried; 
They stood 'round the grave, 
And many's the sigh they gave, 
As the dirt was shoveled up to the brink; 
And, on the tombstone,

From the controlling influence of di-ink.

THE WORLD'S., STAGE; OR, ACTORS ON 
EARTH, 
hung only by Lorris WitiNETT, tiff artist ot the' 
highest order of merit. 
Now the poet often says, that all the world's a 
seam 
And men are simply actors here on earth, 
Some live for many a 
day, while others pine aware 
And no one knows their value or their worth. 
But my advice to all my friends to night, 
Either rich or poor, look manly, strong, and bright, 
And as we ascend the hill of prosperity and good-will 
May we never meet a 
friend a 
coming down. 
Now, if, perchance, you meet an old friend upon the strnat, 
He is poor, and all the world may sneer at him, 
Oh, do not pass him by, to give him something try, 
And remember that his poverty's no sin, 
Welcome him and grasp him by the hand, 
Honor him with any in the land, 
For as we ascend the hill of prosperity and good-will, 
May we never push a 
man a 
corning down. 
Now there's many a 
noble man, who no riches can command, 
Yet may be the noblest hero of them all, 
Many a 
glorious deed he's done, many a 
victory he has won, 
Yet his honor and rewards are very small; 
But, when he's dead, and sadly laid to rest, 
His praises they will sing in every breast, 
But as they ascend the hill of prosperity and good- will 
They never pushed a 
brother going down. 
There's our working man to- day, with his small and scanty 
pay, 
Striving hard a 
family to maintain, 
While the rich they sit at home 
With the treasure that they own, 
Yet the poor may ask assistance all in vain 
When hunger and desperation is your lot, 
You'll find a 
welcome in the laborer's cot, 
For as they ascend the hill, they help up with a 
will 
Any poor or needy friend a 
coming down. 
Now New York once had a 
man rich and wealthy, 
grand, 
Who had millions at his disposal every day, 
But all the papers tell, he died in a 
prison cell, 
And the poor man's friend forever passed away, 
Boss Tweed has gone to heaven, I 
am sure; 
He may have stole, but he gave it to the poor, 
But at the summit of the hill, 
He helped up with brain and will, 
Any brother or sister going down.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER 
As 
recited by VON Bovi.E, with great success. 
The woman was old, and ragged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day ; 
The streets were white with a 
recent snow, 
And the woman's feet with age were slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with hughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep. 
Hailing tit_ snow pled white and deep, 
Past the woman, so oh': and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered 
11I 1ping hand to her, 
So weak and timid, afraid to stir, - 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horse's feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery Otree.
,,, 
A. last came out of the merry troop 
The gayest boy of all the gronp; 
He paused beside her and whispered low, 
"I'll help you across if you wish to so go." 
SOMEBODY'S MOTHER 
Continual. 
He: aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet a'ong, 
Proud that his own were firm and strong; 
Then back again to his friends be went, 
His young heart happy and well content. 
4( She's • isoniehody's Mother,' boys, you know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow, 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help MY 
Mother—you understand ? 
,tf ever sh3's poor, and old and gray, 
And her 3wn dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's Mother !" bowed low her head 
In her home that night, acid the prayer she said 
Was " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is SOMEBODY'S SON, and pride and joy." 
Feint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak, 
Angels caught the faltering. wcrd. 
And " SomebAy's Mother's " prayer is heard.

LIFE IS BUT A GAME OF CARDS. 
Recited by the W INNETT'S in their new Comedy- Drama, 
" 
Restored to Life." 
Life is but a 
game of cards, 
Which each one has to learn, 
Each shuffles, cuts and deals a 
pack, 
And each a 
trump cloth turn. 
Some turns a 
high card at the top, 
While others turn a 
low; 
Some hold a 
hand quite full of trumps, 
While others none can show. 
Some shuffle with a 
practiced hand, 
Arid pack their cards with care; 
So they may know when they are dealt, 
-Where all the leaders are. 
'Thus fools are made the dupe of rogues, 
And rogues each other cheat, 
'Rut he is very wise indeed, 
Who never meets defeat. 
In playing, some lead the ace, 
Their counting card to save, 
Sonic play the deuce and some the tray, 
And many play the knave. 
Some play for money and some for fun, 
And more for worldly fame, 
And not until the game's played out, 
Can they count up their gain..] 
41 
LIFE IS BUT A GAME OF CARDS. 
(Concluded.) 
When hearts are trumps we play for love, 
Then pleasure decks the hour, 
No thought of sorrow checks our joy, 
In Rosy's beauteous bower. 
We dance and sing, sweet music make, 
Our cards at random play, 
And while the heart remains on top, 
Our game is but a 
holiday. 
When diamonds chance to crown the top, 
Then players stake their gold, 
And heavy sums are won and lost, • 
.f3y gamblers young and old. 
Intent on winning, each dot h 
watch 
Iis cards with eager eye. 
;So he may watch his neighbor's hand.. 
And cheat him on the sly. 
When eluls are trumps, lookout for val., 
On ocean and on land. 
For bloody deeds are often done, 
When clubs are in the hand. 
Then lives are staked instead of gold, 
The days are worn out broad, 
Across the broad Atlantic now, 
See clubs have got the lead. 
And last of all is when the spade, 
Is turned by hand of time, 
And al WZ1 vs finishes up the game, 
In every land and every crime, 
No matter how mulch a 
man may win, 
Or how much a 
man may save, 
You'll find the spade turns up at last, 
Arid digs the player's grave.

DASCHEN ON THE RHINE. 
As Recited It.y the Popular Character Actor, Taos. H. winatrr. 
If ever you go to Switzerland, 
The land of varied charms, 
Where Nature, ever smiling greets 
Her guests with outstretched arms; 
No matter what your guide-book says— 
Be certain, rain or shine, 
To stop a 
day and see the falls 
At Daschen on the Rhine. 
Provide yourself with a 
walking- stick, 
Stout boots, a 
broad- brimmed hat, 
And don the worst old coat you've got; 
Tain't chic—but what of that? 
And don't you forget an Alpine horn 
They call it here a 
stein--
For beer's the horn they chiefly like 
At Daschen on the Rhine. 
'Twixt mountain slopes, in verdure clad, 
Stretch vales of rural wealth— 
A landscape fair, that tells of naught 
Save harmony and health. 
No lawyer here e'er found a 
case, 
Nor doctor—I 
opine, 
For Schweitzer is the only " kase 
At Daschen on the Rhine. 
The honest peasantry, whose homes 
Thick dot the country o'er, 
Will never—hardly ever—turn 
The tourist from their door, 
Unless he lost his pocket-book. 
They're somewhat in the line 
Of franc and centime-ntal folk 
At Daschen on the Rhine. 
And when at last you've seen the falls 
For half an hour or so, 
And after loafer' ' round a 
while, 
Conclude it's time to go 
To dinner, take especial care 
That frugally you dine; 
The falls are steep—and prices, too, 
At Daschen on the Rhine.

OUR BRILLIANT GERMAN DROLLERIES. 
DER DUTCHMAN VOT DONT GOT LEFT. 
A 
DAY or two ago, as the San Francisco steamer was mov-
ing away from her landing. a 
portly German, much excited, 
ran as rapidly as possible (low)] the staging, fearful that he 
would be left, his speed being augmented by the idlers on the 
wharf, who encouraged him with such remarks as " Let out 
another link, old boy !" " Hurry up. you're late!" " Just see 
him fly!" etc. 
The boat had only got t,wo or three feet from 
the wharf when he made a jump and landed on board all 
right; taking his handkerchief from his pocket. he mopped 
the perspiration from his face, drew a 
long breath, and then, 
happening to glance back toward the landing, from which the 
steamer was about two hundred yards distant, he ejaculated, 
in th e tone of 
one who had escaped a deadly peril: " Mein 
Gott! vat a 
jump I 
makes."

THE CUE FOR THE C 
UR 
l'AIN. 
A poem written by FRANK W RIGHT, of Shelby's Theatre, 
Buffalo. New York, and recited by LorriE,S; 
THOMAS WIISNETT, the, popular favorites. 
For many a 
year he had stood, true as steel, 
At his desk in the the theater's prompt-stand. 
His hair white as snow in the service had grown, 
To thousands he'd lent a 
helping hand. 
At rehearsals, Old Jimmie (he was so nick- named, 
Was attention—all siiiiles, 
not, a 
frown, 
Watching entrance and exit, while marking his book, 
For the cue the green baize to ring down. 
'Young aspirants longing for histrionic fame 
Oft depended on Jimmie's quick ear; 
He'd throw them a 
line, when lost in their part. 
So none of the audience could hear. 
-Unseen, attentively each artist he watched. 
It' hether leading man, heavy, or clown; 
And at each cue or trick, like the plot which he held,. 
His bell rang the drop- curtain down. 
Not much of an actor; responsible, though; 
And if any time they were short 
For a 
second old man, or a 
character 
The manager always " " sought. 
He'd play it, not brilliantly, let it be said, 
(You're gone front its now, poor Jim Brown:) 
But no matter what it was, he'd be off the stage, 
And w 
atch for the cue to ring down. 
One nip:Id—it was Hamlet, I 
think, that , they played— 
Everyt ling had gone smoothly and %veil; 
The eiv• for the curtain was spoken ltuid. tWiCe, 
Butt silent hung jimmie's prompt bell. 
In atntizement the actors rushed wild from the stage, 
Regardless of buskin or gown, 
To see. and inquire the cause of delay 
From Jim, why the drop wasn't down. 
In a 
heap by the desk poor old Jimmie laid, 
His hands clasping upward to hold, 
The bell-handle which, for twenty years past, 
He had rung at his post, true as gold. 
Paralysis struck him. 
His face, though in death, 
As in life,. wore a 
smile, not a 
frown. 
The angel of death had stuck hiS hand forth, 
And poor Jim's life-curtain rang down.

THE WOLF AND THE LAMB. 
BY 
BOBBY NEWCOMB. 
" 
Order in the court! 
Witness, take the stand; 
too you solemnly swear? Hold up your right hand. 
Kiss the book—that will do. 
Now, tell the court 
Why this man, your husband, before me is brought." 
" 
Your Honor, you see I'm tired and weak, 
So much so that really I 
scarcely can speak; 
I'm sorry that Tim was arrested last night, 
But you see he is foolish and often gets tight. 
A good husband, your honor, sure I 
don't wish to tell— 
This bruise on my cheek? Why, your honor, I—I 
fell! 
Have I 
children? 
Ah, bless them, they've both pass-
ed away; 
Did they die of hunger? Sure I'd rather not say." 
Last night Tim was tipsy, sure that was too bad, 
And he beat and he kicked me, but then he was mad, 
'Twas the neighbors who had him arrested, not me; 
He won't do it again, so let him go free. 
And turning her eyes to the brute in the pen, 
She said: " Tim, you won't, darling, ever strike ma 
again? 
But his eyes glared fiercely, a 
broad oath he swore, 
With a 
bound he had reached her, struck her down 
to the floor! 
" 
Bring him here!" thundered Justice, 
I 
regret I've not the power to send you for life—to 
the very last hour; 
I'll see that she's cared for. 
Take hid' quickly from 
here,

Recited by the Great VON Bon& 
Up frem the meadows rich with cora! 
Clear in the cool September morn-
The clustered spires of Frederick eland, 
Green- walled by the hills of Maryland. 
Round about them erchards sweep, 
Apple and peac:i-trees fruited deep, 
Fair as a 
gaideu of the Lord, 
To the eyes of the famished Rebel horde. 
On that pleasant day of the early fell, 
Whee Lee marched over that mountain wall- 4
= 
Over the mountains winding down, 
Horse and foot into Frederick town. 
Forty flags with the silvery stars, 
Forty flags with their crimson bars, 
Flapped in the moreing wind ; the sun 
Of noon looked down and saw not one. 
Up rose old Barbara Frierceie then, 
Bowed with her four score years and ten, 
Bravest of all in 'Frederick town, 
She took up the flea the men hauled down, 
In her attie window the start she net, 
To show that ONE HEART wa., loyal yet. 
Up the street Came the rebel tread, 
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead. 
Under he, sleuched hat left and right 
Be glanced ; 111J old flag met hi s 
sight.

Conti, lied. 
4uick, as it fell from the broken etaff 
Dame Barbara snatches the silkee scarf; 
She leaned far out on the window sill, 
She shook it forth wtth a 
loyal will. 
" 
Shoot, if you must, this gray old head, 
But spare your country's flag," she said. 
A 
shade of sadness, a 
blush of shame, 
Over the face of the leader came• 
The noble nature within him stirred 
To life at Barbara's deed and word 
" 
Who touches a 
hair of you gray head, 
Dies like a 
dog I March on !" he said, 
All day long through Frederick street, 
Sounded the tread of marching feet--
All clay long that free flag tossed 
Over the heads of that Jebel host; 
Ever its torn folds rose and fell 
On the loyal winds that loved it ; 
And, through the hill-gaps, sunset light 
Shone over it with a 
warm good night. 
Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er. 
And the rebel rides on his raids no Inn L 
Honor to her I 
and let a 
tear 
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall' bier 
Over Barbara Frietchie's grave.

And ever the stars above look down
