End of my first full day in the pines. 
We've spent quite 
a bit of time today acquainting ourselves with the Kaypros. 
They 
take some getting used to. 
Jens and I went up on the fire tower today. 
I've never seen 
such flat country. 
It's easy to see how people can get lost in 
the miles and miles of dense pines. 
It 
is also very beautiful 
and green with lots of variety 
in the species of plants--oak, 
different types of pines, the low brush. 
There is 
little that is 
ugly here. 
Even run—down houses and stores have more charm and 
beauty because of the natural beauty around them. 
It 
is not the 
harsh beauty of a western forest, with the bones of the earth 
poking through the vegetation. 
The starkness of a western plains 
landscape emphasizes the drabness of many less—than—pleasing 
edifices. 
Here, the moist green atmosphere is nurturing and 
perhaps distracting. 
Last night we ate at the Woodshed Inn just down the road, 
where they serve clams and turtle (snapper) soup among other 
things. 
The atmosphere of the place was comfortable--a 
fireplace, deer trophies on the walls, posters of 
local events, 
including a pickerel contest, whatever that is. 
A few young 
people (3 or 4) were there, talking to the waitress. 
Later a 
middle—aged man 
in camouflage fatigues and a red cat—cap came in 
and played a video game. 
The music was somewhat loud--a station 
that plays rock and roll--sort of soft rock and oldies. 
It was a 
Philadelphia station, and I enjoyed the Beatles music and other 
oldies that I remember. 
G—Four Mile; 27GT 
The people here have a way of expressing themselves that is 
very direct. 
Mr. Roncoroni at the state school was very quiet 
during our meeting with school officials this morning, but when 
we got outside he talked at length about the quality of the 
school's meals. 
Then he made comments to us, virtual strangers, 
about the seemingly excessive compulsiveness of another executive 
of the school. 
He reminded me of some of the eastern stereotypes 
I have seen in the movies--like New York cabbies who talk your 
ear off with personal opinions about everything.

We had lunch today at Nardo's Pizza in Brown's Mills, run by 
Italians with very thick accents. 
While there some black young 
adults came in to eat and play Pac—Man. G—Brown's Mills; 21GT

TX01: 
We listened to John Sinton, professor of Environmental 
Science at Stockton State College and a Pinelands Commissioner, 
give us his impressions of the Pine Barrens. 
He told us that the 
oldest settlement region is the coastal area and the Mullica 
River Basin (the latter is partially in my first—week territory), 
which were settled around 1670 or 1680. 
Also, Batsto and 
Pleasant Mills were early settlement areas. 
Old coastal family 
names include Sooy (pronounced Soy), Clark, Mathis, Truax (sp?), 
and Sprague. 
The lakes around here have gone through an evolutionary 
process of sawmill pond or cedar pond (bog?)--->cranberry bog --- > 
recreational 
lakes. 
The railroad came through and created a 
second overlay of settlement and divided the northern pines from 
the southern pines. 
It created the towns of Fruitland (now 
gone), Vineland, Paisley, and Chatsworth. 
The southern section 
was split into smaller land tracts, patchier than the northern 
land patterns. 
The southern patchy pattern is related to varied 
land uses. 
G—Egg Harbor; 05GT is basically a German settlement, but there 
are incoming Puerto Ricans and Blacks. 
I received other 
information on settlements, ethnic makeup, and people to contact 
from Mary on a printout she made up. 
My area for the first week 
or two is area three on the overall map. 
It consists of the 
south—central area of the pines, 
including Hammonton, Egg Harbor 
City, Chesilhurst and other towns near them. 
The western part of 
my territory is basically agriculture interspersed with forest. 
The eastern part is also that kind of a mixture, but is oriented 
around the Mullica River. 
Egg Harbor City was a ship—building 
center, so that area is apparently more maritime in feeling. 
In Hammonton, there 
is a DeFiccio family who are orchard 
people--apples and peaches. (I believe they were recommended to 
me by Mary or Nora.) 
Row crops are grown in Buena and Buena 
Vista, also Vineland. 
Gloucester county is similar. 
(This is 
still mostly information I got from John Sinton.) 
The "shatter 
belt" 
is pockets of scrub pine and fertile land 
in the western 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 3 
areas of area 2 (Christine's territory). 
Many old cranberry bogs 
are now lake communities. 
Sinton identified "the pines as refuge" as a recurring 
theme. 
For centuries people have come to the pines to escape 
other events, people or places. 
Now it seems that the immigrant 
groups who have traditionally sought refuge in the pines are 
being denied access by the Pinelands Commission's zoning laws 
that limit housing to large acreage. In the past, Germans, 
blacks, Russians, and other groups have been able to come here 
and establish colonies for little cost. 
It 
is not likely that 
Vietnamese immigrants could do the same because they could not 
afford the minimum ten—acre tract on which to build a house 
Ten—acre land tracts just don't work. 
It depends on ethnicity, 
land forms, and localized climatic conditions. Those who are now 
seeking refuge in the pines are the middle and upper middle class 
urbanites trying to get away from the city. 
I was encouraged to check with the County Federation of 
Sportsmen's Clubs in May's Landing. 
In Hammonton there are 
large family tracts that fit the landscape, interspersed with 
sugar sand. 
Counties mean little 
in New Jersey. 
The important 
jurisdictional units are townships with their town councils. 
These townships may not contain actual towns that carry the same 
name as the township, but the town council nevertheless is the 
governing body for the area. 
TX02: 
Rita Moonsammy spoke to us about perception of the 
environment in the pines by 
inholders and newcomers. 
We 
discussed how people landscape their yards and how they perceive 
the pines. 
To what extent are they self—conscious about numbers 
of trees in a yardscape, presence of native plants, ornamental 
horticulture and the like? 
Pay attention to the kinds of animals 
that people enjoy in the pines--do they have bird feeders or 
other devices that allow them to observe animal 
life 
in the area? 
TX03: 
Mary Ann Thompson from G—Vincentown; 23GT came and spoke to 
us about her life and observations in the pines. 
She 
is a native 
of the area and 
is an attorney specializing in environmental 
law. 
Her family has been 
in the cranberry business for years and they 
are the largest remaining holdouts from the Ocean Spray 
cooperative. 
When we asked her why they don't join the co—op, 
she said that they made a commitment years before this co—op was 
formed after a previous one failed. 
It 
is basically loyalty that 
keeps them using their own distributors, although she indicated 
that there are some things about Ocean Spray that her father 
doesn't particularly like. 
She invited us to witness the 
cranberry harvest which started yesterday and will continue into 
November. 
We plan to go there next week. 
Mary Ann's perspective on the newcomers is that they are 
escaping high taxes and don't have any appreciation of where they 
are. 
Medford Lakes is not the Pine Barrens--they keep a few 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 4 
trees and call 
it Pine Barrens. 
(Mary Ann used the term "Pine 
Barrens as 
if 
it was an official place name--a proper noun: 
:"people call 
it Pine Barrens," not "people call 
it the Pine 
Barrens.") 
She says that people have no sense of perspective 
about the Pine Barrens. 
New people are coming in faster than old 
timers can teach them how to 
live here. 
Getting lost is a theme 
in this region. 
Mary Ann says that people used to move buildings more than 
they do now. 
They also used to clear land around the buildings 
to avoid fire danger. 
Buildings on a farm have to be spaced so 
fire doesn't jump. 
She does not like new housing developments. 
Larchmont is a "horrible" planned development where the streets 
and places were named all 
at once and don't have anything to do 
with where they are. 
Local foodways: 
blueberry and cranberry wine, cranberry 
pie, cranberry relish, and Mary Ann says that her family has lost 
a recipe for green cranberry pie. 
Other local specialties 
include snapper (turtle) soup, which she says 
is a Quaker 
specialty. 
Established local 
restaurants owned by 
local people 
are the Red Lion Inn and the New Gretna House. 
Mary Ann suggests 
that Mrs. Stevenson near Four—Mile Circle 
is a very good cook. 
Lots of women cook for local gun clubs. 
Fire halls sponsor 
clambakes several times a year. 
Mrs. Green, a virtual catalog of 
local food events, can be contacted at 726-1609. 
The only fresh 
water food is snappers and catfish. 
Glen Horner can be contacted 
regarding local fishing inland (He 
is 
in Burrs Mills). 
People on 
the Mullica can also be asked about fishing there. 
Inland 
fishing seems to be mostly recreational, but blacks do probably 
fish for subsistence. (This information came from Jens.) 
Mary 
Ann felt she gained perspective on the Pines from being 
in 
England, where the landscaping focus is on small areas and 
attention to detail. 
TX04: 
In the evening, Mary and I went for a walk toward G—Pakim 
Pond; 21GT. 
Mary has an extensive knowledge of 
local plants and 
was able to identify many. 
We collected and armload of rabbit 
tobacco, which she wants to dry and I think use for tea. 
My 
favorite plant was pokeweed--it is considered a local weed, I 
guess, but it 
is beautiful. 
It grows about five or six feet high 
and has thick red stems with deep green leaves. 
It also has long 
narrow clusters of blossoms and berries that vary 
in color 
depending on their maturity from green to red to deep purple. 
The overall effect of the plant is very graceful and elegant. 
The berries are poisonous, but Mary says that some people know 
how to make poke berry wine that is safe. 
The leaves are also 
used for food, and are called poke salad 
(there's a song called 
"Poke Salad Annie"). 
We saw many birds and heard their songs. 
We also heard frogs and crickets, and once we thought we had 
cornered a turtle in the brush because we heard some rustling, 
but we couldn't see anything. 
Later we saw birds--toehees--down 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 5 
in 
the brush, scratching for insects. 
The undergrowth in the 
pines is very dense, providing cover for all kinds of wildlife, I 
imagine. 
On the left (north?) side of the road, we could not see 
into the forest more than one hundred yards, perhaps more like 
fifty. 
On the right it seemed a little more sparse.

Today we spent lots of time on the Kaypros because Jay 
is 
here to help us get it right. 
Carl 
is also here and gave some of 
us a brief introduction to the equipment, especially the cameras. 
He 
later gave a complete training session on the mono Nagras to 
some of the workers. 
I am to carry a stereo one, and will 
go 
over it with him later. 
He still has not determined the best way 
to distribute the three camera kits he brought. 
I had a chance 
to do some work on the stereo Nagra when Mary set it up to record 
MaryAnn Thompson yesterday. 
Sue and I went for lunch to G—Mayo's; 27GT because we wanted 
to try the chicken cutlet sandwich that included cranberries, 
according to the menu. 
It proved to be served with jellied 
cranberry sauce on the side, just like I can buy anywhere in the 
country, so that was a little disappointing. 
However, the night 
before, we went to Mayo's and had cioppino (steamed scallops, 
clams, shrimp, and other fish I couldn't identify served in a 
tomato sauce with green pepper and onion) that was very good--
also had their snapper soup. 
It was too thick. 
I didn't dilute 
it with sherry, however, as the others did. 
Mary says there are 
seven different kinds of meat in a turtle--all different flavors 
and consistencies. 
I thought at one point that I was chewing on 
a mushroom, but it was turtle meat. 
TX02: In the afternoon, Christine and I went and did our laundry 
and then drove around the area to orient ourselves. 
I proved to 
myself that I could get around without getting lost--at least if 
I stick to main roads that are marked on the map. 
As I get more 
acquainted with the territory, I expect I can take off on all 
kinds of side roads without too much fear. 
Anyway, the area is 
so populated that you are likely to end up somewhere no matter 
where you go. 
If I just kept driving 
in the West, I could go for 
a hundred miles without hitting any signs of human habitation. 
Here 
it 
is a different story. 
We drove up around G—Fort Dix; 19GT, and went on to Juliustown 
which has some interesting houses and yardscapes. 
There were a 
couple of little white churches--one was Methodist, I don't 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 7 
remember what the other one was. 
My impression of all these 
little towns so far is the tourist's—eye view, and I find them 
utterly charming. 
I like the big trees everywhere, and I like 
the two—story clapboard buildings. 
We found that many roads are 
not marked, and we wrote a posted number for Route 630 onto the 
map, as 
it was not identified there. 
There are many others, 
however, that are not identified either on the map or by signs 
along the road. 
We came back through G—Browns Mills; 21GT and noticed the AME 
church there along Route 534, I think--it is the main road going 
east from the stoplight near the shopping center towards 
Whitesbog. 
We wrote down the times of the services. 
We turned 
off toward Whitesbog and took a look at the cranberry bogs there 
and saw the old buildings where the New Jersey Conservation 
something or other are housed. 
The houses used to be where 
Elizabeth White and her employees lived. 
We proceeded eastward to where the road met Route 72 and we 
turned back west along 72. 
I made the connection between 
Presidential Lakes and our headquarters. 
Sue took us to the 
little market in Presidential Lakes the first night we were here, 
and I had no 
idea at the time how we got there. 
We cut through 
the forest to Route 70 and turned back eastward so we could go to 
Chatsworth. 
There is a little town with plenty of 
interesting 
places to investigate. 
Yardscapes look promising, and there were 
more of those little churches. 
I hope to get into some meatier 
work next week.

Today I spent most of the day in sessions with Carl 
learning about the stereo Nagra--how to use the machine and how 
to set up mikes (tip—to—tip is the favored set—up for many 
situations. 
It gives a greater sense of space when using 
earphones, and probably adds to the ambience even through 
speakers). 
He also gave us an impromptu photography and interior 
lighting lesson during supper, which was lasagne prepared by Sue 
and Christine. 
In the afternoon I went to LDS church services at G—Fort Dix 
13GT which is the nearest ward. 
It 
is made up mostly of military 
people, but is not specifically a military service. 
There are a 
few people I met who may be useful, and I got a few leads: 
Lorena Homer--wrote a children's book about the pines. 
To see 
her book and to contact her, go to the Brown's Mills library. 
Elinore Tedeschi has lived at G—Country Lakes; 21GT for about seven 
years. 
She is from Trenton. 
Her phone number is 893-4055. 
She 
may know some people who would be helpful. 
Fran Zimmerman, the 
bishop's wife, told me that her daughter is the librarian at 
G—Brown's Mills; 21GT library, and she would know lots of people to 
contact. 
Her name is Laura Grahovac, and the number at the 
library 
is 893-8262.

Sue and I set out today to acquaint ourselves with my area 
of the pines 
in the southern half of the reserve. 
We headed 
south through G—Chatsworth; 27GT on highway 563. 
It looks somewhat 
lower—middle class and promises to have some interesting 
yardscapes to 
look 
into. 
We stopped at a little cafe so Sue 
could look 
it over. 
The woman said that she had acquired the 
restaurant and did not come from the area originally. 
The cafe 
was austere—looking, and the work area was open to the public eye 
behind the counter. 
There was a regular residential—type 
refrigerator in the eating area near the work area, and all soft 
drinks were in a self—service commercial refrigeration unit with 
sliding glass doors. 
The woman didn't seem especially open to 
too much conversation. 
She was watching television on a tiny 
portable TV. 
We followed Route 563 south to G—Green Bank; 26GT on the way 
to New Gretna. 
We stopped and Sue took pictures of an old inn 
there. 
There are several old buildings in the area that could be 
of 
interest. 
Without detailed examination of them I can't say 
much about them. 
All are clapboarded, at least two stories, with 
entrances on the side rather than the gable end. 
We found that the bridge across the Wading River was closed 
for repairs, so we headed back in the direction from which we 
came and took Route 542 down to G—New Gretna; 15GT, where I hoped 
to make initial contact with George Heinrichs, a sneakbox maker 
referred to me by Mary. 
I succeeded in contacting his wife by 
phone after unsuccessfully trying to find his house on North 
Maple Avenue (Route 542). 
I forgot to ask her for directions to 
the house, but she did indicate that her husband would probably 
talk to us some evening. 
I will call for an appointment. 
He 
works at Ocean Yachts in the daytime. 
His name and address as 
shown in the phone book are: 
G. 
W. Heinrichs, N. Map►e Ave., New 
Gretna. 
Phone: 
296-2380. 
Other things we noticed in New 
Gretna: 
There were a number of houses visible off to the left as 
we came 
in on Route 542 that are three (perhaps more) stories 
tall with very narrow bases so that they almost look like arrows 
shooting up toward the sky. 
I want to take a closer look at 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 10 
them. 
They don't look like plan book houses, at least not from a 
distance and from behind. 
There were some interesting yardscapes 
as we came 
in. 
A couple of observations after spending the day looking at 
people's yards in the pines: 
1. 
Yards run right into the road 
with no more definition of boundaries than the change from grass 
to pavement. 
2. 
The same goes for property boundaries, except 
more so. 
While fences do exist, they are few and 
it seems 
generally used in front of a house, but not to divide property. 
Property lines may be distinguished only by a few shrubs along 
the line, or just a different kind of grass or different mowing 
pattern. 
While similar casual boundary markers can be found 
in 
the West (my father's house and his neighbors handle their 
property lines 
in this manner, for instance) 
it seems that fences 
are found more often. 
3. 
There seems to be a regional penchant 
for decorating yards with figures, flowers, martin houses, and 
other colorful 
items. 
I have seen more little yard figurines 
here than I have seen in years in the West. 
I hope to photograph 
some of these. 
Many of them that I have noticed in the region--
G—Medford; 18GT, G—Hammonton; 11GT, and G—Buena; 02GT, among others--
are Catholic saints. 
Others are dwarves, animals, bird baths, 
etc. 
Other things I noticed in New Gretna: 
lots of gingerbread 
houses (in varying degrees of ornateness). 
These are all over 
the area of the pines, 
indicating a lot of building going on 
in 
the Victorian period. 
On Route 542 between G—New Gretna; 15GT and 
the Wading River was a sign for S & S Construction, builders of 
bulkheads, docks, septic systems, floating docks, and also land 
clearing. 
This might be a good contact. 
A furniture maker had a sign up on Route 30, west of Paoli's 
Bar 
in G—Egg Harbor; 06GT. 
I'd like to see what he does. 
In 
G—Elwood; 12GT, there was what looked like an old fruit market that 
had been turned into a garage. 
One of our contacts later in the 
day commented on how the fruit stands had diminished in number 
over the years. 
Here was one that had gained a new lease on 
I 
if e. 
TX02: Our big success of the day was between Egg Harbor and 
Hammonton on Route 30, where we stopped at Emma's Fruit Market.--
I should note that in G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT we stopped at Harry's 
Farm Market, which sold not only 
fruits and vegetables, but also 
yard figurines. 
The stand is run by Lena Massarelli and her 
husband Harry. Lena said that her brothers farm and she buys the 
produce from them for her market. 
She wasn't very talkative, 
although pleasant. 
Sue shot a series of pictures of the stand, 
which 
is a large one and beautifully arranged to take full 
advantage of the colorful produce. 
She told us that in a couple 
of weeks they will have hundreds of pumpkins, and they will paint 
faces on them. 
Lena is from Hammonton, and has lived in Egg 
Harbor for thirteen years. 
She showed us pitcher gourds, which 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 11 
they are selling to be dried and used as bird houses. 
They 
apparently saw the 
idea in a seed catalog. 
Locally—grown produce 
includes corn, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and peaches. 
The yard 
art, which consisted of Disney—style dwarves and Catholic saints 
among other things, 
is made by Lena's son at Massarelli's Lawn 
Ornaments in G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT. 
TX03: Back to Emma's Farm Market G—Elwood; 12GT. 
We were attracted 
to 
it by the large colorful signs leading up to 
it along the 
road, and Sue wanted to photograph them. 
We stopped and went in, 
and immediately were engaged in joking conversation with two 
young men who posed and hammed it up for Sue's camera. 
We 
introduced ourselves and were introduced to Ralph Putiri, his 
cousin Floyd Bird, and another cousin, Claude Angelo. 
Ralph told 
us that Emma was his mother, and she passed away in March. 
Her 
brothers had farms on Pine Road in G—Hammonton; 11GT. 
There were 
thirteen children in her parents' family, and the sons ran farms 
and the daughters had markets (Mary's Market, which is a short 
distance up the road toward Hammonton, belongs to one of the 
sisters.) 
The women also helped on the farms. 
When the 
daughters got married, they brought their husbands into the 
family business. 
One of the groups of merchandise which they sell at the 
market are hand—packed preserves of various kinds. 
They used to 
be made by Emma, but they went ahead and did 
it this year without 
her--continuing the practice even though she 
is dead. 
They 
include various kinds of jam and pickled peppers. 
We bought a 
jar of peach—nectarine jam, which they tried for the first time 
this year, and a jar of mild pickled sweet peppers. 
The peppers 
do not seem to have sealed in canning, though, so I don't know if 
anyone will have the nerve to try them. 
They smell heavenly, 
though. 
The jam is good. 
The family used to grow all 
the 
produce that is sold 
in the market, but they have gradually died 
or gotten out of the business, and now they purchase most of the 
merchandise. 
The stand is closed in January and February (I 
think they close at Christmas and like Lena Massarelli, open 
after Palm Sunday.) 
From mid—November to mid—December, they make 
cemetery blankets of greens decorated with artificial flowers and 
other decorations. 
Greens are usually balsam, Canadian pine, 
moss, and other things that can be gathered in the woods. 
While we talked, Ralph's father came out of the building and 
was introduced to us. 
His name is Salvatore Putiri, and he 
is 
apparently quite a storyteller. 
Ralph repeated what sounds like 
a family litany: 
Dad started with $200 and a pickup truck, came 
here after World War II, and lived 
in a house that is now the 
kitchen of their present house. 
While we were talking with Mr. 
Putiri, another cousin, Charlie Palmieri, drove up. He was about 
60 years old and dressed in a deep—v—necked tee shirt, tan 
trousers and a cat—cap. He was happily welcomed, and they all 
immediately started trading insults and praise for storytelling 
prowess. 
Salvatore and Charlie evidently hold the prizes for 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 12 
lying and storytelling. 
The boys (Ralph and Floyd) told us about the city of Amatol 
which is 
in ruins behind their fruit stand. 
It was a settlement 
of 25,000 people and was centered around munitions manufactures 
for World War I. 
I would have to 
look up the history of it to 
get the complete story, but it sounds like 
it was built by the 
government, then after the Great War the government tore it down. 
Ralph later took us on a drive around the area and tried to find 
some curbs and other remains of the city, but the pines are 
rapidly taking over. 
As we drove through on sand roads, we saw 
no ruins, but lots of dumped junk. 
It was a mess. 
Ralph told us that we ought to go to the Pleasant Mills 
Batsto Church cemetery G—Pleasant Mills; 12GT, G—Batsto; 26GT and 
look for the graves of the Doughty brothers, who were killed 
within days of each other. 
I was unclear on when they were 
killed and why we should look up their graves. 
I think he was 
giving us some local history that he finds of 
interest. 
One thing that Ralph said about his growing—up years with 
his father--he said it 
in front of his father, and everybody was 
laughing--"I grew up insulted." 
Among the stories that were 
being traded--mostly in fragments--by Charlie and Salvatore were 
hard luck stories about their years of getting started and living 
on the farm. 
They promise to be good informants, and we told 
them that we would be back for a recording appointment. 
We were introduced to Bozo, a beagle that was abandoned near 
the fruit market--named Bozo because "he's so stupid;" and 
Mother, a black cat that frightened a woman customer so much one 
day that the woman let out a scream that shook Ralph up. 
Ralph 
took us 
into the family house where his twin brother Sal was 
sitting. 
He was also very personable. 
The house is very 
comfortable and looks like they are prosperous. 
There was a 
magnet on the refrigerator that said something about love for 
Jesus. 
We followed Ralph in our car while he took his brother's car 
to the service station, then he got in with us and started on a 
tour of his family's important places in G—Hammonton; 11GT. 
As we 
drove he told us that his people came from Calabrita near Naples 
in Italy. 
His grandma was 6 or 7 years old at the time, and she 
was born in 1887. 
She met her husband in the United States. 
Her 
name was Nevicella 
("Nelly") DeMarco Palmieri. 
Nevicella means 
"snow from heaven." 
Ralph told us about the family plot in the 
cemetery in Hammonton between Oak Road and Pine Road on Rt. 30. 
In 1930 the family built a vault on the plot. 
We drove to the Palmieri family home, now deserted, on Pine 
Road G—Hammonton; 11GT. 
This was the house that Ralph's mother and 
her twelve brothers and sisters grew up 
in. 
As we drove down 
Pine Rd., we passed through peach orchards. 
Ralph commented that 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 13 
it 
is beautiful for the eyes and the nose during blossom time. 
He said, upon being asked, that people in the area like to drive 
around when the peaches are 
in bloom so they can enjoy the 
beauty. 
The old house, on the east side of Pine Road, about 2 
miles north of Rt. 30, 
is a story and a half with two bedrooms 
upstairs, a living room, kitchen, bathroom, and one bedroom down 
stairs. 
We were able to go 
in because the door was wide open. 
There were pieces  of old decrepit furniture  and remains of a 
cemetery blanket—making operation on the main floor. 
There were 
dead pine boughs and boxes containing dusty plastic poinsettias. 
A rough sketch of the lot 
is 
included 
in the print files of these 
field notes. 
Behind the house was a chicken coop, a house that 
may have housed farm workers, a tomato field, and a unit of 
garage and sheds. 
To the north of the house was a packing house. 
Across the road was a sweet potato field and a reservoir. 
Ralph 
said his mother's family lived 
in this house 
in the 1320s and 
30s. 
They later moved to a large white house which he pointed 
out to us on Rt. 30. 
On Pine Road on the way to the house is a memorial to the 
Italian settlers who came to G—Hammonton; 11GT. 
It has "Our Lady 
of Mount Carmel" written on 
it, and an inscription in English and 
Italian. 
There are 
lots of Ralph's relatives living on Pine 
Road. 
All 
the way up the road, he would say, "That's where Uncle 
Rocky lives," or "That's Aunt Mary's house." 
The apples grown in this area, according to Ralph are Red 
Delicious, Golden Delicious, Winesaps, and Jonathons. 
Once a year Ralph's family has a big reunion. 
They play 
softball and volleyball and eat. 
A road we crossed while on Pine 
Road is the old stage route from Philadelphia to Tuckerton. 
The 
house on the corner was a hotel. 
We asked more about the memorial, and Ralph said that we 
could get more information on 
it from St. Joseph's church--they 
should have pictures of the history of Our Lady of Mount Carmel 
Society and celebration. 
Ralph has a BA in environmental science, and his brother has 
one 
in 
life science. 
He started to talk about the Pinelands 
Commission, that its edicts are too extensive. 
He favored it at 
first, but 41 or 61 acres per house is just too much. 
I might 
add that when we met his cousin Charlie back at the stand, he at 
first thought we were from the Commission. 
He said something 
about, "Do you know what ought to be done with the Pinelands?--
Get rid of 
it." 
Ralph then guided us to the cemetery where his family is 
buried. 
He told us that one of his cousins called "Jimmy the 
Brute" is buried there. 
The vault contains Palmieris, DeMarcos 
and Arabias. 
We looked through the glass in the doors and saw 
bricked—up crypts that left very little floor space. 
On top of 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 14 
the crypts and on the floor were figures of saints, and on one 
grave there was hung a very large rosary with red rose—shaped 
beads. 
Outside the vault are other family graves. 
Ralph's mother, 
for instance, didn't want to be buried in the vault. 
A series of 
DeMarco graves has a photo of the deceased on each stone. 
We returned to the practice of making cemetery blankets. 
Ralph said that most of the blankets are 5'x2-1/2', but it 
is 
possible to get pillow sizes, too. 
We returned to the fruit 
market and dropped Ralph off with the promise that we would 
return for a taping session. 
Ralph told us that he knows some of the black Jewish 
community that lives behind the market--he knows them very well, 
and can probably provide introductions. 
We drove past their 
synagogue on Moss Mill Road, and saw the area where they live, 
which looks pretty middle class. 
The name and address of the 
synagogue should be 
in Sue Samuelson's field notes. 
While we were in the cemetery, Ralph and I talked about his 
conversion from Catholicism to born—again Christian. 
He attends, 
but 
is not a member of, a Hammonton Baptist church. 
He said that 
he began to read the scriptures and became convinced that his 
church was not following the correct doctrines. 
He believes that 
people are saved by faith, not by works, and he did not approve 
of the fact that missing Mass one week could send one to hell. 
He also did not like confession, because it emphasizes works. 
He 
is currently dating a girl from Toronto who has never been to a 
movie because she 
is from a fundamentalist family. 
He thinks 
that it may be heading toward marriage, and I asked him if he 
would never go to movies again for her (she had refused to go to 
a film--"Return of the Jedi"--on grounds that it was at a four— 
plex theatre that was also showing "Risky Business" and people 
might see them going into the theatre and think that they were 
going to the racier film). 
He said that she felt she should not 
interfere in his life or impose her beliefs on him if they were 
to marry. 
TX04: We continued home through G—Chesilhurst; 31GT, which Mary 
says 
is a very old black community, but we hardly saw any blacks 
there. 
We turned off the main highway hoping to see some of the 
old neighborhoods, but found ourselves in neighborhoods of tract 
homes inhabited by whites. 
We turned down one dead—end street, 
and a young man waved at us, which took me back. 
People in rural 
Colorado and Utah, when on back roads in their own areas, tend to 
wave at every oncoming motorist as they drive down the road. 
I 
had not seen anything to cause me to expect such friendly 
behavior here. 
Either he mistook us for friends since we were 
turning down that dead—end road, or he was genuinely friendly, I 
don't know which. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 15 
We drove on northward, and got onto a road we didn't expect 
to, and found ourselves heading toward Medford through G—Medford 
Lakes; 17GT, a posh newer community--kind of a bedroom community 
for Philadelphia. 
There were houses and houses and houses back 
in the pines, and they were all very fancy. 
This is the sort of 
thing that Mary Ann Thompson is concerned about. 
In G—Medford; 
18GT, we found some very interesting yard art around houses off 
the main road. 
This area has more money and could be contrasted 
with Chatsworth in terms of yardscapes and approach to the 
landscape. 
I want to return to photograph some of these yards 
that contain flowers and figurines. 
Medford's main street is 
very self—consciously picturesque, with beautiful gardens and 
scrupulously—painted facades. 
We drove on to Red Lion, where we stopped at the diner for 
dinner. 
The food portions were simply too large--period. 
I was 
overwhelmed. 
The fish was good, and I took the remaining portion 
home with me 
in a food bag. 
We returned home, extremely tired. 
Working with another 
fieldworker is really very rewarding, because we are able to get 
down much more information and also take care of documentary 
tasks at the same time. 
Sue and I also seemed to have about the 
same natural work pace, so it was comfortable. 
After being back at the office for a while, Christine called 
and said that she needed Carl 
to come and photograph the man she 
was interviewing. 
Carl had just left for dinner, so I said I 
would come. 
I asked 
if 
lights were needed, and she said no, but 
that, as Carl pointed out later, was a mistake. 
He said you 
should always take your lights--the girl scout's motto is 
"Be 
Prepared"--(I can't remember that far back to know if that really 
is the Girl Scout's motto, but I got the point). 
I shot some 
film of Mr. Webb, a hunter and gatherer in Chatsworth. 
He sounds 
like a very good informant.

A couple of things I neglected to mention in yesterday's 
notes: 
There was a woman (I assume it was a woman--cultural 
bias) advertising in front of her house for house plants for sale. 
This might be a good opener for women's work. 
She 
is 
located on 
Route 541 across from the Medford Township school district 
offices, south of G—Medford; 18GT. 
Also, I went into a grocery 
store in G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT and found a poster for a turkey 
supper sponsored by the Germania Volunteer Fire Company, 
Saturday, Oct.l, 1983, at the Fire House on Cologne Avenue 
(perhaps in G—Cologne; 09GT?). 
Dinner will be served from 4:30 to 
8 pm, and the price for adults 
is $5.50. 
We also noticed a 
Quaker meeting house in G—Medford; 18GT. 
Sue pointed out the two 
doors for men and women. 
This was on the east side of the main 
drag. 
I also copied information from posters in the grocery 
store in G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT for the following events: 
"Barrel 
House Banjos," Saturday, October 8, from 9pm to 1 am. 
Peanuts, 
beer, sandwiches--all you can eat, $7.50. 
Phones, 646-0018 and 
965-4459. 
Sponsored by the American Legion Auxiliary, Galloway 
Township 109GT, Carton Avenue, Route 30. 
Post 430. 
Also the 
131st Anniversary Service, St. Paul's United Methodist Church, 
Route 9, G—New Gretna; 15GT, Sunday, September 25, 3 pm. 
Dr. 
Reginald Thomas, speaker; Robin Bourgignon, soloist. 
6:30 pm, 
Bev Gallucci 
in concert; 7:15pm, Dave Bailey, speaker. 
I located 
the phone number of the Germania Volunteer Fire Company, Cologne 
Avenue, G—Cologne; 09GT--965-2022. 
TX02: Now for today's notes. 
I went out with Carl this morning, 
mostly on a reconnaissance mission and to learn more about the 
cameras. 
We made note of the fire houses along the way and 
generally just scoped the southern part of my territory out. 
We stopped 
in G—Medford; 18GT while the morning light was 
still good, and Carl helped me to understand some principles of 
good photography regarding composition, light, and lenses. 
We 
shot some pictures of the old houses with their manicured facades 
along the main road through town. 
We experimented with framing, 
back lighting, and bright front lighting. 
We shot some 
streetscapes that should be useful 
in understanding the general 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 17 
character of the town with its self—conscious historicity. 
I 
commented to Carl that I wouldn't be surprised if the town has 
zoning laws for the main drag that require frequent painting and 
general upkeep of the old houses so that "ye olde" colonial 
image 
remains untarnished. 
The part that the past plays in people's 
lives 
is certainly an aspect of sense of place that must be 
explored. 
Obviously these big, money—built houses in Medford are 
important, just as big, money—built houses of the twentieth 
century are important. 
Perhaps the rule 
is, once important 
(fiscally speaking), always important. 
It took a century or more 
for the little cheaply—built houses of the past to become 
important--is it just because they are old, and represent a 
heritage that helps to identify one 
in society? 
Kettle Run Volunteer Fire Co., No. 225. 
Route 623 south of 
G—Taunton Lake; 18GT and north of the community of Marlton Lakes. 
On Rt. 73 
four miles north of G—Blue Anchor; 41GT, I noticed a 
house with a farm market sign that intrigued me. 
It would be a 
good example of the smaller operators as opposed to the big farm 
markets like Emma's (see yesterday's notes). 
There was a 
graveyard at the Sacred Heart church on Route 73 about three 
miles north of G—Blue Anchor; 41GT. 
Cedar Brook Volunteer Fire Co. No. 
1, Station 253 on Rt. 536 
just west of Rt. 73. 
Bingo every Tuesday night. 
Carl commented 
that the three—digit numbers that we see on the fire houses might 
be assigned by some central fire station clearing or licensing 
board. 
If so, we don't need to be mapping these ourselves--the 
licensing bureau should have a complete listing. 
G—Cedar Brook; 41GT has some interesting yardscapes on Rt. 536 
just west of Rt. 73. 
There was a house with cedar trees with 
whitewashed trunks, or the remains of whitewash on the trunks. 
Carl commented that that is pretty standard, unremarkable stuff, 
but I don't recall seeing the practice before. 
The Cedarbrook 
Rod and Gun Club is on 536 west of 73 also. 
Noticed the Stern 
Light Inn/Cocktail Lounge in the same area. 
Probably seafood. 
All 
through this area we saw tract homes, tract homes, tract 
homes. 
Prevention of this kind of mass intrusion into the Pines 
is, I think, the Pinelands Commission's stated purpose, or one of 
them. 
Locals, however, seem to latch onto the fact that you 
can't build a house on a lot unless you have 10, 41, or 61 acres 
around it (I've heard all three numbers--I don't know which, 
if 
any, are accurate.) 
This prevents many people from building 
their dream house 
in the pines. 
TX03: We were traveling along 536 and noticed a black man fishing 
off a bridge in a small 
lake. 
We stopped and Carl began to 
question him about his fishing--what he was going after, what 
kind of bait, etc. 
Although I was sitting right there and asked 
a couple of questions, the man talked mostly to Carl, 
looking at 
him as he spoke. 
Man stuff. 
It made me curious as to whether he 
would have opened up as much if 
it had been me alone or two 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 18 
women. 
People are different, of course, but I still believe that 
there are some things a fieldworker can get and some he or she 
can't get, because of his or her own gender, cultural background 
and race, among other things. 
The man was very talkative and 
friendly. 
His name was Dave Fleming Jr., of 131 Park Ave., 
Woodbury, NJ 08096--out of our area. 
But he 
is 
important as a 
user of the pinelands. 
He was dressed in an Air Force shirt with 
the insignia torn off. 
Carl suggested that if 
it was his shirt, 
he was probably and airman at the most, judging from the shapes 
of the insignia. 
Mr. Fleming spoke of getting out of the service 
in 1952, so it may or may not have been his shirt. 
He told us 
that he was fishing for pickerel, but does not eat them because 
the water is so polluted. 
He said he used to eat them, but he 
got sick--broke out all over--once after eating one, and so will 
no 
longer eat them. 
He had a fishing license which he showed us, 
complaining about the price of the things nowadays. 
He said the 
lake 
is called New Brooklyn Lake G—Winslow; 33GT, and the bridge, 
which was a stone affair, was called Red Bridge. 
He said the 
bridge was there when he got out of the service in the fifties. 
Mr. 
Fleming told us that he 
is a master mechanic, and was 
in the area today to go and fix a woman's car for her, so he 
thought he'd take 
in a little fishing. 
In addition, he told us 
that he was an ordained minister in a Holiness church, the Church 
of Our Lord Jesus Christ. 
He said he converted in 1968 and 
started ministering in 1973. 
They have Sunday morning and Sunday 
evening services, and the church is, I believe, he said, 
in White 
City, which I could not locate on the map. 
Mr. Fleming's phone 
number is 848-8222. 
TX04: Carl commented on the martin houses around some homes. 
They are believed to keep the mosquitos down. 
The houses are 
little gable—roofed affairs with several round holes 
in the sides 
and they are mounted on high poles. 
Star Cross Volunteer Fire Co. No. 
1, 
on Rt. 555 near the 
Bank of Newfield in Franklin Township. 
We noticed the drought— 
yellowed soybean fields all 
through this area. 
One more thing about G—Medford; 18GT: 
Carl said hello to 
several people on the street, and none of them responded. 
He 
said he must have been under the mistaken impression that he was 
in the South, where people do respond to greetings from 
strangers. 
As we were driving southeast on US 40, we came into 
G—Downstown; 03GT and noticed a wagon collector on the left. 
At 
this point in our travels, suddenly Italian surnames were on 
every sign. 
Between Downstown and G—Landisville; 03GT, there was a 
house with a sign out front advertising homemade tortellini and 
ravioli. 
In Landisville there was the Landis Italian—American 
Restaurant. 
All of the election campaign signs 
in this area and 
in G—Buena; 02GT touted politicians with Italian names. 
In 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 19 
Landisville, there was the St. Anthony Bakery selling Italian 
breads. 
A horse farm was called Caselli Farms on Rt. 54 north on 
the right. 
On the left (this is just after we turned north onto 
54) we saw a field with a picking crew that looked like they were 
probably migrants. 
Farm markets along this stretch were 
advertising yams. 
On the left we saw the G—Hot Cup Diner; 03GT. 
It was an archetypal diner with the steel facade like a railroad 
car. 
Carl speculated that the names 
in the Buena area might 
indicate families from southern Italy. 
As we continued north, I 
noticed a place called Frazier's Gardens that looked interesting 
from the standpoint of yardscapes and plants used. 
A nurseryman 
could perhaps give some insight into what plants people prefer to 
use and whether they are native to the area. 
Other yardscapes 
along the same stretch near Frazier's Gardens looked interesting 
G—Buena Vista; 03GT. 
We must be careful that we are not 
documenting the outstanding and the unusual more than the usual 
as we pursue yardscape studies. 
Like others, I have a weakness 
for the picturesque, as M. 0. Jones would say. 
Buena Vista Township District 3 Volunteer Fire Department, 
on Rt. 54 north of Buena. 
There was a sand company on the left 
in the same area. 
Also noticed yard art on Rt. 54 north of Buena 
Vista Fire Dept. 
Carl commented on 
land use density and how much 
can the land support; how much can people and the pines tolerate? 
CB Auto Parts, Rt. 54 north of Buena G—Buena Vista Twp.; 03GT 
had some delightful pieces of salvage art made from auto parts. 
Carl suggested this might be a project for Joseph Czarnecki to 
handle. 
Such pieces could make nice centerpieces for an exhibit. 
Angio's Place, homemade something or other at the 
intersection of Rt. 54 and Spur 561 G—Folsom; 08GT. 
In G—Hammonton; 11GT, as we came in on Rt. 54 (12th Street in 
Hammonton), there was a large old house on the right (east) with 
grape arbors all the way around it. 
Saw a church--St. Anthony's 
of Padua. 
There may be printed histories of some of these 
churches and townships that might give us some background. 
We 
entered Wharton State Forest on Rt. 206 and noticed blueberry 
fields along the road G—Hammonton; 11GT. 
North of G—Atsion; 22GT 
was the Pic—A—Lilli Bar which advertised steamed crabs. 
There was 
also a farm market advertising Silverqueen corn. 
Carl explained 
to me the types of corn 
in the region--Silverqueen is a pale 
corn. 
Carl prefers the sweet corns of the area. 
We have seen 
many signs advertising "Jersey corn," so 
it seems to be a staple 
of the agricultural economy here. 
Medford Farms Volunteer Fire Station 431 at the intersection 
of Hawkins Road and Route 206 south of G—Red Lion; 23GT. 
We 
noticed that we were back to the three—digit numbers with this 
station--some of them further south did not have those numbers. 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 20 
Does Burlington County license its fire companies while other 
counties do not? 
I was afraid that this morning's fieldwork was not very 
productive, partly because I was feeling low personally and 
partly because we didn't really meet any hot prospects. 
However, 
as I look over these notes, I see that we found some things worth 
following up, and that is good. 
You can't barge into an area and 
begin interviewing until you have gotten some feel for it, some 
sense of the patterns that exist there. 
I learned some valuable 
things from Carl on this trip, both 
in terms of photography and 
fieldwork, so the morning was well—spent.

I spent most of the day writing up fieldnotes and 
organizing my files so I can have easy access to 
leads and maps 
of my area. 
In the late afternoon I took off for a short tour of 
the Batsto area. 
The Mt. Royal Gun Club at G—Jenkins Neck; 26GT 
has a small jail—type cage in front of 
it. 
I'll have to find out 
what it 
is. 
The Interboro Gun Club is north of G—Green Bank; 26GT 
on Rt. 563. 
It was raining on this trip, but not very hard. 
The roads 
were wet, and when I got to Green Bank I didn't see the stop sign 
soon enough and when I hit the brakes, I did a long squealing 
skid around the curve, causing a man at the Green Bank Inn to 
come out to see what the noise was. 
It gave me a scare--I'm just 
glad that no one was coming from the other road. 
I stopped to 
catch my breath at Mike's Country Store, west of G—Green Bank; 26GT 
on Route 542. 
There was a sign advertising a taxidermist in G—Egg 
Harbor; 05GT. 
Near G—Crowleytown; 26GT on Rt. 542 was the 
Fellowship Gun Club. 
TX02: An interesting spot was the G—Batsto; 26GT G—Pleasant Mills; 
12GT United Methodist Church and graveyard on Rt. 542 west of 
Batsto. 
The church 
is a gable—roofed white clapboard building 
with two doors, one near each corner in the gable end. 
The roof 
pitch 
is fairly shallow by local standards, and the date 1808 is 
written at the peak of the gable. 
The sign out in front 
announces the services to be Morning Worship, 9:30 am; Church 
School, 10:45. 
The sign also states that the church has been in 
continuous service since 1808, and the pastor is 
listed as Rev. 
Margaret Abrams. 
Interesting surname, interesting gender. 
TX03: As I continued along Rt. 542, there was an 
increasing 
number of blueberry fields, and the feel 
of the place changed 
from woods to open agricultural 
land. 
From Pleasant Mills on 
until the road meets US 30, the houses are bigger, some are 
newer, and there are open spaces and fruit stands. 
It 
is a 
prosperous—looking area. 
The yards are large with nice lawns. 
Some have native trees in the yards, some have no trees. 
There 
are more packing houses, and the closer you get to G—Hammonton; 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 22 
11GT, the bigger the fruit operations appear to be. 
The Nesco Volunteer Fire Company is along this stretch of 
Rt. 542 in G—Nesco; 12GT. 
I turned around at US 30 and retraced my steps, making 
further observations along the way. 
A couple of homes have old 
farm machines (just one) displayed in the front yards--perhaps a 
statement of the value of agriculture in the lives of the 
residents. 
Unlike the west, people here do not get creative with 
mailbox supports. 
While old plows, cream separators, 
cultivators, milk cans and the like are used to support mailboxes 
in Utah and Colorado, here the emphasis seems to be on pure 
practicality. 
The supports are thick posts of wood, or they are 
metal posts. 
I stopped at a small grocery store in G—Nesco; 12GT to talk 
with the proprietor and pick up some ice cream for dinner. 
The 
store did not have a name as far as I could see--the sign on the 
outside said only "Groceries." 
The woman inside, fiftyish, 
blond, was named Cheryl 
(I didn't catch her last name). 
She was 
born and raised in the area and has lived there all her life 
except for nine years spent in Williamstown after she got 
married. 
She felt that G—Williamstown; 41GT was too big and had 
too much traffic, and she missed her family and friends who were 
back in Nesco. 
Her husband, Jim, who was not there when I was, 
was not born in the area but has lived there for fifty years. 
She told me to stop back in anytime. 
I think she will be a 
valuable contact. 
I commented to her that I had seen lots of 
packing houses, and she said that the area is really the 
blueberry area. 
Cheryl herself works in the store (which she and 
her husband bought a couple of years ago) in the evenings and 
works part time in a cookie factory in the daytime while Jim 
watches the store. 
I noticed as I left that the Gulf station 
across the street from the store had a poster in the window 
advertising some kind of supper on Sept. 24. 
I'll check back on 
it. 
As I was coming into Crowleytown I noticed a sporting goods 
store with a sign that said River Boat Basin Donzi Carver. 
I 
have no 
idea what this means, but will check into 
it. 
Carver may 
be a person's name, or 
it may mean some kind of craftsman, or it 
may be a brand name of something. 
(I 
later discovered that these 
were boat motor names.) 
TX04: I stopped and talked to a couple who were loading a canoe 
onto a truck north of G—Green Bank; 26GT. 
They were in their 
sixties and turned out to be employees of Bel Haven resort where 
canoes are rented, and they had come to pick up a couple of 
canoes. 
Their truck had a National Rifle Association sticker in 
the back window. 
They are from near Philadelphia, on the New 
Jersey side, and they live out here all week and return to Philly 
on the weekends. 
I told them what we were doing in the area, and 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 23 
the woman said, "oh, those pineys are something else. 
They've 
got one speed." 
I said "Slow?" and she said yes. 
The man said 
"Those pineys are really a sketch." 
Then he went on to say that 
they like to do things their own way and no one can get them to 
change it. 
He also said something about how those people 
(pineys) have had their first amendment rights taken away from 
them by the Pinelands Commission. 
He said he was an outsider, 
but he sympathized with them. 
The couple invited me to come and 
take a canoe ride. 
In G—Chatsworth; 27GT there was the Harmony Gun Club on the 
highway. 
TX05: In the evening we had a meeting with Mary in which she 
encouraged us to contact some local officials in our areas who 
could give us a top—down view of their municipalities and give 
some ideas on who to contact. 
We were also encouraged to keep 
our eyes open for community festivals and other get—togethers. 
Mary gave me the name of Floyd West, mayor of Green Bank. 
I am 
to call and see 
if I can find out about the fire department 
numbers from the county.

TXO1: 
I drove to New Gretna today looking for inspiration, and I 
got it. 
I had noticed some three—story houses the other day down 
there, so I took a side street to take a closer look. 
Before I 
got to the house, though, a beautiful garden caught my eye. 
It 
was large and well—kept and had Clorox bottle—whirligigs on poles 
to frighten away deer and birds (I 
later found out). 
The 
gardener's name is Benjamin A. Allen and he was born and raised 
in G—New Gretna; 15GT 
His wife Elaine is from Long Island, New 
York. 
They met because her family used to come down to the New 
Gretna area in the summers. 
They have been married 45 years. 
Benjamin says he has some Indian (Lenni Lanape) blood in him. 
His wife is German. 
I told him I was interested in his garden 
and his methods and reasons for doing it. 
He was not one to take 
off on stories and had to be asked questions continually to 
elicit information. 
I taped him in stereo in his living room and 
then we went out into the yard and I followed him with the tape 
recorder running on mono as he talked about each crop and tree. 
While in the house his wife contributed some information about 
how she preserves and uses the harvest from the garden. 
He 
is a 
retired sand miner and oysterman, among other things; she works 
as the secretary for the local school board. 
He quit sand mining 
because he says it got so he couldn't get the sand because there 
were so many restrictions. 
His trucks and equipment are all 
sitting in his garage unused. 
Benjamin uses cut up crabs and mussels for fertilizer in his 
garden G—New Gretna; 15GT. 
He has a couple of lots in the bay for 
clamming and oystering, but has not done it lately because of an 
ulcer. 
He had some long poles lying in his yard by the fruit 
trees that he was planning to take out to mark his boundaries in 
the water. 
Apparently he has to do that once a year or so as the 
old poles deteriorate or lean over too far. 
As the various crops 
run out after their seasons, he plows them under with his tractor 
and disc and plants winter rye as a cover crop. 
It looks like a 
lawn by spring, and he plows that under before planting in the 
spring. 
He tries not to use too many chemicals on his garden, and 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 25 
generally just picks bugs off the plants and kills them. 
His 
parents used arsenic for bugs. 
He sprays very lightly, but did 
not say what chemical he uses. 
He has had potato bugs that 
attack potatoes and tomatoes, and he has also had some Japanese 
beetles this year, but the seagulls came 
in and ate them. 
He 
figures his garden is about 3/4 of and acre, and some of the 
crops he plants are peas, string beans, pole beans (limas), 
potatoes, cabbage (Chinese and regular head cabbage), Silverqueen 
corn, tomatoes, and radishes. 
A sketch of his garden plan and 
the rest of his place is 
in the hard copies of this file. 
Mr. Allen's mother was a Mathis, another long—time family 
from this area. 
His father was born at Point House, now Mystic 
Islands. 
A couple of notes on his dialect--there seems to be (within 
my 
limited experience) a distinct New Gretna accent that tends to 
close the "o's" and adds "r's" 
in certain places. 
"Limas" 
(beans) 
is pronounced "limers," and he spoke of "me woodpile" and 
called me "youse," among other things. 
Not being a trained 
linguistics person, that is all I can say. 
Mr. Allen irrigates his garden--he says he had to this year 
it was so dry--using a well and a gas pump (the pump can also be 
operated by hand). 
This year, he gave each fruit tree ten 
gallons of water every night, and they produced beautifully. 
I commented on his woodpiles behind the garden--they heat 
their house with two wood stoves--and he told me that he made his 
own 
log splitter, which I attempted to photograph. 
I took quite 
a few pictures, but the light was not good, and I was not very 
happy with composition and action in any of them. 
He and his wife gave me two names to contact: 
Walter 
Mathis, who works around the bay, and Alston Allen, who is also a 
bayman and they said he 
is a very good storyteller. 
Both live 
in 
G—New Gretna; 15GT--Allen is on North Maple. 
When I left the Aliens, Mrs. Allen gave me a small jar of 
spiced cucumbers--like spiced apples, only cucumbers. 
She got 
the recipe from her daughter—in—law in North Carolina, and plans 
to give them as Christmas presents. 
They taste good, but it's 
hard to get the idea of their being cucumbers out of your mind--
they seem a little flabby for my taste. 
TX02: After leaving the Aliens I went to the New Gretna Bake Shop 
and Deli which Sue and I spotted the other day when it was 
closed. 
The woman running it--I didn't get her name--makes lots 
of the usual bakery stuff, but also has blueberry muffins which I 
sampled and found wonderful. 
She also makes round loaves of 
sourdough bread which she says the New Gretna House restaurant 
serves with their dinners. 
She makes fruit preserves (she told 
me that preserves are different than jam because they have the 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 26 
whole fruit in them, not mashed) out of blueberries and 
strawberries. 
I bought some of the blueberry preserves, and 
they, too, are wonderful. 
Yum. 
She was selling the preserves in 
quarts and the small jam—size jars. 
The Station House restaurant 
in Tuckerton serves her preserves at breakfast. 
I went there for 
lunch on her recommendation, but did not find it outstanding. 
She said that at the New Gretna House, which only serves dinner, 
you dine, while the Station House is good for a quick, good meal. 
TX03: Across from the Station House restaurant G—Tuckerton; 47GT 
was a Radio Shack, so I went in and got an adaptor plug so I 
could run my tape recorder off the cigarette lighter in the car. 
That made 
it much safer to take notes while driving, which I tend 
to do. 
I was also able to do more 
thorough note—taking as a 
result. 
Perhaps a lot of 
it 
is inconsequential, but it records 
my impressions as I drive. 
The man at the Radio Shack used to work for the Conservation 
and Environmental Studies Center at Whitesbog, and he had some 
words to say about the Pinelands and pineys. 
I think he saw them 
in a somewhat stereotyped manner, but after I said some things 
about trying not to see them in a quaint or stereotyped way, he 
talked about all the people who have come to study the funny 
people in the pines and the pineys pull their legs. 
He told a 
story that he heard from the fellow that runs Mick's Canoe Rental 
about a New Yorker who came with a camera wanting to study the 
pineys, and they took a regular local snake, cut its head and 
tail 
off, and put it between two trucks and stretched it out 
until 
it was ten feet long. 
The guy took lots of pictures and 
was really a joke among the locals. 
Personally, I find the story 
a bit hard to believe and I wonder if I was having my leg pulled 
or 
if the Radio Shack man was having his pulled. 
He said the 
snakes ordinarily are no more than six feet long. 
Four feet 
seems a pretty long stretch to me, 
in more ways than one. 
TX04: The balance of my notes have a more stream—of—consciousness 
tone because they are transcribed from my taped observations in 
the car: 
Decoy shop halfway between G—Tuckerton; 47GT and G—New Gretna; 
15GT. 
There may be something to consider in the horizontal and the 
vertical 
landscapes and their psychological effects. 
I am on the 
Atlantic City freeway and notice the horizontals of the coastal 
and agricultural lands versus the verticals of the pines. 
In 
addition, there is the lush, rounded fullness of the deciduous 
forests in the region as opposed to the sparse verticality of the 
pines. 
Alan Dundes, where are you? 
South on 575, G—Pomona; 09GT -- lots of tract—type houses, 
large lawns, 
lots of trees, but not big trees. 
Some flowers and 
shrubs--can't make any generalizations at this time. 
Church of 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 27 
the Assumption on the left as I sit at a stoplight in Pomona 
(intersection of 575 and US 30). 
Proceeding past US 30 on 575, 
the houses are a lot older than on the north side of highway 30. 
They are spread further apart though the pines. 
There are lots 
of pruned and shaped bushes--at least they are rounded a little 
on top 
if nothing else. 
The Radio Shack man also talked about pineys whose parents 
bought up a lot of 
land and they still cut the same land their 
parents cut, but they wouldn't dream of selling it because they 
don't consider that it belongs to them. 
It may be theirs, but 
they don't apparently have a sense of ownership. 
There is 
lots of wooded land for sale after Pomona. 
There's 
an airport here, and the woods around it are for sale. 
TX05: Large cemetery and chapel mausoleum on the outskirts of 
May's Landing as I drive into town. 
In the middle of town there 
is an old cemetery on Cape May Avenue, which is also Rt. 563 to 
Egg Harbor City. 
It 
is kitty—corner from St. Vincent de Paul 
Catholic church. 
Another tiny cemetery is through the block from 
the Hamilton township offices by the Methodist church on Main 
Street. 
A street banner proclaims Hamilton Township Day, St. Oct. 8 
at Underhill Park from loam to 9 pm G—May's Landing; 10GT. 
I asked 
the girl 
in the twp. clerk's office about it and she said the 
twp. employees are going to have a booth to sell food to 
establish a sunshine fund for the twp. employees. 
That is a fund 
that provides money for people who are retiring or sick and such. 
Over the door of the twp. offices is a sign saying that May's 
Landing is the proud home of the current Miss New Jersey. 
I stopped to ask directions to the county offices from an 
old man who was painting a gate a bright blue, and 
it turned out 
that he was Russian and didn't speak a word of English. 
I was 
unable to find out if he had family members there who could talk 
to me. 
I'll have to 
look into the Russian community further. 
The Wheaton Plastic Containers Company has a wonderfully 
interesting old industrial building that looks like it has been 
restored from some other older industrial purpose. 
It 
is 
in 
beautiful shape and might be worth having Joseph shoot some 
pictures of it 
if 
it 
is within our purpose. 
It has big colored 
silhouettes of the plastic containers they make in the alcoves of 
the brick building. 
TX06: It seems there are more fences in the city than in rural 
areas, and of course there are curbs marking boundaries between 
yard and street. 
Taking 559 out of May's Landing and there 
appear to be no pines in the forest. 
Another minute and there 
are pines and cedars too. 
Shaped shrubs bordering a driveway. 
A 
yard on the left has a horseshoe driveway and cedars, yard art, 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 28 
bird baths, little statues. More sculptured shrubs and more. 
An 
old I house--at least it appears so from the outside. 
One 
neglected victorian house. 
Fences around yards--wooden pole 
fences--one is a little piece of one at the very front of the 
yard. 
It does not enclose the yard, but just is at the front, 
saying, "Here's my house." 
It 
is a presentation to the road. 
This 
is 
in G—Weymouth; 10GT. 
TX07: North on 559 crossing 322. 
Weymouth Furnace is a state 
park containing ruins of an old furnace, I guess. 
Can't see any 
interpretive material. 
Further north on Route 623 is a burnt—out 
pine area--skeletons of pine trees pointing upward with the 
low 
brush regrowth. 
This is on the way to Elwood. 
Coming into 
Elwood, passing through an area in the pines where there are a 
few homes among the trees. 
A pair of houses next to each other 
provides an interesting contrast. 
One 
is a big tract—type home, 
the other a small boxy shed—style. 
Both are painted, but the 
yardscape around the bigger home 
is more elaborate, more plants, 
flowers. 
The other seems only to have dry lawn around it before 
the pines. 
Both are back 
in the pines, so 
it 
is difficult to see 
clearly. 
G—Elwood; 12GT Volunteer Fire Department, Incorporated 1922, 
is on the White Horse Pike. 
Coming out of Elwood there is a 
Toro lawnmower dealer with log doghouses for sale of all 
different sizes. 
Coming out of G—Hammonton; 11GT on 559: 
house on the right 
has incredibly shaped bushes-- there's a spiral --and there are 
flowers and art in the yard. 
The house is 
large modern one--
randh style. 
Now on 561 heading away from Hammonton, entering G—Winslow; 
33GT township, there are beautiful yardscapes--manicured and 
prosperous—looking. 
Some are plain, but the effect of the area 
is aesthetically pleasing. 
People definitely like to prune their 
shrubs here. 
An upper—middle class neighborhood here has large 
newer houses, but the pines have been retained around the houses. 
A few lawns are garnished with small stone terraces, border 
plants, shaped shrubs. 
On Highway 73 near Blue Anchor there 
is a 
large victorian era farmhouse with a large open lawn with low 
hedges defining the driveway and the edges of the property in a 
rough sort of way. 
There is no definition of boundaries at the 
front of the lawn, however--it opens right onto the pavement. 
The Sportsman's Tavern on the right near the Williamstown 
turnoff on 73 has a sign advertising a turkey shoot on Sunday, 
Sept. 25. 
G—Blue Anchor; 33GT. 
Just passed Volunteer Ambulance 
Corps, didn't get numbers. 
TX08; On 73 coming out of Cedar Brook I stopped into the small 
produce stand that intrigued me the other day. 
I wanted to see 
how the small operators fare against the big ones. 
The man, with 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 29 
only three visible teeth, was 
in a rush to get somewhere, so was 
not too talkative. 
He had onions and potatoes for sale which he 
grew himself on a plot of 
land. 
He had had tomatoes earlier. 
He 
rents the place he lives 
in with his family--it is a large white 
farmhouse ca. 1915. 
The vegetable "stand" was made of old 
furniture, boards, and burlap piled into some configuration I 
couldn't quite follow for logic. 
He said this is his first year 
doing a produce market on his own. 
He has always worked with his 
cousin before. 
Next year he wants to add crabs to his 
inventory--something about the borough G—Cedar Brook?; 33GT 
allowing him to sell produce this year and adding crabs next 
year. 
There 
is no license required, but apparently some 
permission from the borough is necessary. 
TX09; Turned onto 536 and came through G—Waterford Works; 33GT 
where there are tons of brand new homes and treeless 
subdivisions. 
I may revise my thinking on domestic fencing. 
It may not be 
much different here than anywhere else in the United States. 
There is definitely more fencing in urban areas than in rural 
ones. 
Rural agricultural 
land here 
is not fenced like 
it 
is out 
west. 
I haven't seen one barbed wire fence in the pines. 
It may 
have to do with whether animals are being kept in or out. 
Waterford Volunteer Fire Company No. 
1, just off US 30 on 
536 G—Waterford Works; 33GT. 
At G—Chesilhurst; 31GT I turned left (south?) at the light and 
found the black neighborhood we missed last time we came through. 
It 
is a middle class neighborhood. 
The Grant AME Church, Rev. 
Carl T. Wade, pastor, Sunday School, 10-11 am and Morning worship 
11-12 am. 
Nice stone building probably built in the 1960s--there 
is money here. 
Stopped at the Country Farm Market coming out of 
Chesilhurst--custard stand, home—packed peppers, but not as nice 
as Emma's Farm Market at Elwood/ Hammonton. 
The guy was sitting 
watching TV, wasn't too interested in making a sale--just as 
well, all I wanted was a custard. 
Chesilhurst definitely has an 
aura of being suburbanized--just passed Beth and Ken's Pet Hotel. 
Drove through Atco--curbs, gutters, nice prosperous looking 
yards, there's one along this main street with a Virgin Mary 
statue in 
it. 
In town there's a very large fancy Victorian 
house, along with other large ones that are not so fancy. 
Atco 
is a larger town than many in the area, with lots of new housing. 
One tract—type home had a tall picket fence around the back 
yard--almost no 
landscaping. 
It looks pretty new. 
The Clementon Gun Club is 
on Jackson Road as I head east out 
of G—Atco; 30GT. 
West of Indian Mills there are lots of tract 
homes. 
Huge new Shawnee Baptist church on the left, and another 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 30 
housing development G—Waterford Twp.; 30GT with pines left around 
it. 
At G—Tabernacle; 25GT there is a nice old graveyard. 
The 
Methodist church was advertising a rummage sale for Saturday, I 
assume Sept. 24. 
There 
is also the Tabernacle Church of Christ. 
There is a cemetery on the left as I head for Red Lion. 
About 
this time I began to 
lose track of where I was on the map, so I 
can't be sure about villages I passed through after leaving 
Tabernacle. 
TX10: Stopped at a nicely—kept farm just at the head of where 
Moore Road meets the road I was traveling on heading twoard Red 
Lion from Tabernacle. 
I thought I saw some butchering going on, 
with a carcass hanging from a tripod and smoke rising into the 
air. 
It turned out they had some gear hanging from the tripod 
that resembled a carcass, and they were burning trash. 
The 
people were Polish immigrants. 
The man was a little gruff--
something like a man I knew who preferred not to deal with 
women--that's just a hunch. 
I had the feeling that he thought I 
was a little forward and out of line, dropping in 
like that. 
It 
might be 
interesting to see how Jens or one of the other men 
could get along with him. 
Perhaps Joseph, since he speaks 
Polish. 
He wouldn't give me his last name, but his first name 
was John. 
An American man who was standing there with a beer and 
joking with them said that I couldn't pronounce the surname even 
if I knew it. 
There is the main farmhouse, not large, but nice, 
with lots of hanging plants; and there is a second smaller house 
behind it. 
It appears that perhaps the American fellow and 
another one live in the back house. 
There are geese, a couple of 
dogs, and a very nice yard. 
John told me that he would call me 
if they did some butchering, which they expect to do 
in the near 
future as the weather cools off, although I don't know if he will 
actually make the call. 
I should add one other thing abut my experiences today. 
When I stopped at Benjamin Allen's house in the morning, after 
they invited me 
in and started to talk, I broached the subject of 
taping the conversation and went out to get the Nagra and 
equipment only to find that I had locked my car keys 
in the car. 
Naturally, I was terribly embarrassed, and told them that here I 
come all 
professional and everything, and I do something 
hairbrained like that. 
Well, we noticed that the back window was 
open just a bit, and after trying several 
ideas, 
including trying 
to reach Mrs. Allen's locksmith brother—in—law, we came up with 
the idea of attaching a magnet to a fishing pole. 
Mr. Allen 
didn't want to fish, so I maneuvered the pole into position and 
triumphantly brought out the keys. 
For the rest of the morning, 
every time I went to the car for something, they would say, "Have 
you got your keys?" 
All's well that ends well. 
We parted 
f 
r 
i 
ends.

This morning I made some calls to town planners and got 
appointments for next week. 
Also did some fieldnotes and other 
chores around the house. 
In the afternoon I went to G—New Gretna; 
15GT to visit the mayor of Bass River Township, Floyd West. 
He 
was very pleasant and articulate, and he 
is a Texan who married a 
native New Gretna girl. 
My purpose in visiting him was to get a 
picture of the people living in the township and how they are 
distributed. 
As it turned out, he talked for about two hours in 
a very nostalgic tone about New Gretna's past and somewhat about 
its present. I had not intended to tape the interview, expecting 
it to be a nuts and bolts type of meeting, but within minutes I 
could see that it would be worth getting on tape, so set up the 
Nagra. 
He began by naming some of the families that settled in New 
Gretna early on: 
Mathis, Allen, Adams, and Cranmer. 
There is 
some agriculture in the twp., but the most important economic 
factor is the bay (Great Bay). 
In different seasons, the bay 
provides fin fish, muskrat, salt hay, oysters and clams. 
On the 
uplands, or higher ground, people have gardens and raise crops 
like 
lima beans, root crops, and corn. 
Most of the early 
settlers in the area were Scotch—Irish and English, and 
apparently the ethnic make—up of the village is still much the 
same. 
New Gretna, says Mr. West, 
is really different from other 
pines communities like Chatsworth that are inland because it 
is on 
the 
line between the salt marshes and the pines. 
It has also 
moved with the roads. 
It apparently used to be a couple of miles 
north when the old road connecting with Berlin, which used to be 
called Longacoming, was there. 
Mr. West spoke with longing of the regional accents that 
used to be noticeable twenty years ago. 
I, 
as an outsider, still 
notice that New Gretna seems to have a special dialect. 
He says, 
however, that homogenization has occurred, and he 
laments that 
fact. 
He spoke of the old timers who are all 
gone now except for 
Frank Gray. 
He could not see the continuation of the culture in 
the next generation away from those oldsters because of the 
popular media and its effects. 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 32 
Mr. West was 
in the Coast Guard, and that is how he met his 
wife--her name was Betty Lamson, from another old New Gretna 
family. 
He explained at length how he built a garvey so he could 
go out in the oyster beds that his father—in—law had helped him 
acquire rights to. 
He built the boat of Jersey cedar that grows 
in the area, and the local men would comment on his progress 
every morning as they congregated at the Bass River Bridge every 
day, and a day didn't go by that someone didn't stop by to see 
how he was getting along. 
When he was finished, he had earned 
the approval of all 
the 
local baymen because he had built the 
right kind of garvey, 26 feet long. 
It wasn't 25, and 
it wasn't 
27, or it wouldn't have been a New Gretna garvey, he said. 
His 
father—in—law was the source of help as he built it. 
He told me that property boundaries used to be marked by 
trees and other natural features. 
For instance, a big tree 
marked the corner of his property on the deed, and a few years 
ago the tree died and they had to replace it with a metal stake. 
He referred to some deceased boatbuilders, lamenting the 
fact that none were left. 
I asked him if he knew George 
Heinrichs, and he did, and said, "Oh, he builds sneakboxes," but 
his thinking is very much attuned to the lost past. 
He spoke of 
men who run "party boats" for city people who come to fish for a 
day and rent the services of the boat and the owner, probably 
much like city people come out to the western forests and hire a 
hunting guide to take them into the mountains where they are 
likely to bag a deer. 
He told me that certain boats were built 
certain ways because of the kind of work they housed. 
A "tender" 
boat is any boat that tips easily, and would not be suitable for 
oystering. 
That is why a garvey has a flat bottom. 
Now 
fiberglass garveys are being built, and the Gomez brothers in 
Tuckerton build some, he thinks. 
The Knights of Pythias (he pronounced it as 
if 
it was 
spelled "Epytheas", and there was some discussion between West 
and his wife over how it 
is spelled and pronounced) was the local 
organization similar to the Grange in the midwest. 
While we were talking, Frank Gray, the last old timer that 
Mr. West had mentioned, stopped by to visit. 
Having listened for 
about an hour to Mr. West describing the decline of New Gretna, I 
asked Mr. Gray if he thought the town had gotten worse or better 
in the past few decades. 
He said, "The town has improved." 
From 
his perspective, progress like increased services has been a boon 
to the town. 
On the other hand, Mr. West is vehemently opposed 
to any change, even putting house numbers on the houses as 
it 
gets larger. 
He says that they never needed house numbers 
before, because everyone knew everyone else, and he doesn't think 
they should have them now. 
(He did concede that sometime in the 
future they would probably be necessary, but I had the feeling 
that as 
long as he 
is mayor there will be no house numbers in New 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 33 
Gretna.) 
Frank Gray 
is a confirmed Republican, but Mrs. West told me 
that he 
likes Floyd, who 
is a Democrat, and supported him 
completely during his campaign for mayor. 
Frank was employed 30 
years with the state dept. of Conservation and Economics(?) and 
was 
in charge of shellfish. 
He was responsible for developing 
the oyster seed beds along the coast. 
He said something about 
having 250 tongers out in the water catching seed oysters to 
transfer to other areas. 
When Floyd wanted to get started in the 
oyster and clam business after marrying Betty, his father—in—law 
approached Frank Gray in order to procure the lots for him. 
Frank says that he used to know all 
the people in New 
Gretna, but now he only knows about 20%. 
He said that it 
is New 
Gretna now with all 
the people coming in. 
He shared a few 
anecdotes about his experiences--they are on the tape--and then 
left. 
Mrs. West and I began to talk about recipes and foodways 
while the men went outside. 
She explained to me how a duck has 
to be dressed before cooking: 
After plucking the duck, you scrub 
it with Ivory soap and a stiff brush, then soak it 
in salt water 
overnight. 
It 
is then ready for cooking. 
There are three 
favored ways to prepare duck: 
1. 
Roast without stuffing, but 
with a couple of slices of onion, apple, and celery pieces that 
are discarded after cooking; 2. 
Roast with stuffing (white 
bread, celery, onion); and 3. 
Boil and serve with white gravy. 
The duck is called "black duck" because it 
is all dark meat. 
All 
of these forms of duck would be served definitely with coleslaw, 
and probably also with sweet or white potatoes and cranberry 
sauce. 
I have noticed that coleslaw is served with every dinner 
I have ordered since I came to New Jersey. 
It is definitely a 
regional pattern--I don't know how far it extends, but it 
certainly does not exist like this 
in the West, where the tossed 
green salad is the preferred accompaniment to meals. 
Floyd came back into the house and told me about the 
seasonal patterns of food in the area. 
Winter: 
Ducks, eels and 
shellfish. 
Spring: 
striped bass ("stripers"--you bake them, 
often stuffed with a white bread stuffing or baked whole with 
salt pork on top, and other fin fish. 
Summer: 
weakfish. 
Mrs. 
West said that there are two meals that her girls ask for when 
they come home for a visit: 
Clam pop—pie and duck. 
To make clam 
pop—pie, you saute salt pork, add lots of onions and potato, then 
cover with water and simmer for 10 minutes. 
Add the ground or 
chopped clams (she said ground, he said chopped--they seemed to 
differ on the subject), then add the pop—pie (flour, shortening, 
milk, and baking powder), which is spooned into the liquid like 
you would for dumplings and cooked for 20 minutes. 
Floyd said that you spear eels while they're hibernating. 
During that time they're not "green"--full of food and fat, which 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 34 
makes them bitter. 
Eels are deep—fried. 
The family also likes 
blueberry muffins for breakfast, and indicated that they have had 
them for breakfast all 
summer this year, which they don't always 
do. 
I asked if there are any local festivals, suppers, or other 
social gatherings that they enjoy, and Floyd said that they used 
to have covered—dish suppers at church, but apparently they don't 
do 
it any more. 
I asked about the Volunteer Fire Dept. suppers, 
and their immediate reaction was that they are for "outsiders." 
The local fire company holds a clambake on Memorial Day which 
attracts visitors, not locals. 
Lots of beer and clams, and 
it 
gets rowdy. 
The Wests never let their daughters attend these 
functions. 
The placement of the dinner on Memorial Day when lots 
of tourists are coming through the area is an obvious attempt to 
bring 
in outsiders--probably nets more money than the locals 
could come up with. 
They also named the PTA roast beef supper, but said that 
that is put on by all new people. 
However, the Old Home Society 
(the group which is responsible for care of the local cemetery) 
has a dinner on Memorial Day that is only for locals. 
Unfortunately, attendance at that function is falling off. 
This 
dinner is usually turkey, and the women roast turkeys at home and 
bring them to the dinner. 
Floyd feels very accepted by the 
community because he was recently accepted as a member of the Old 
Home Society--in other words, as he said, "they trust me to take 
good care of their ancestors' graves."

TXO1: 
Headed for some local festivals with Sue. 
We agreed that 
I would handle the recordings and she would handle the cameras. 
I noticed as we travelled into G—Speedwell; 27GT south from 
Chatsworth that there is a house with plastic milk jugs lined up 
along the yard edges. 
We'll have to look into that. 
Coming out 
of Speedwell we saw a cranberry harvest in progress, so stopped 
to watch and take pictures. 
The foreman said it was OK to shoot, 
so we stayed for about a half—hour, feeling that it would be an 
inopportune time for interviewing anyone since they were 
occupied. 
The color of the red cranberries as they floated on 
the water and were slowly gathered together by the men pushing a 
frame was strikingly beautiful. 
There was a conveyor belt there, 
but no truck to receive the harvest, so I think they were having 
to wait for that. 
The men were speaking Spanish, but I couldn't 
pick up a word of 
it (my understanding is minimal)--I later 
learned that most of such workers are Puerto Rican and the 
dialect there is quite different from Mexican Spanish. 
The 
foreman was black and pleasant to us and another couple that 
stopped to shoot pictures. 
There were two rather lazy dogs on 
the sidelines that apparently belonged to one of the workers. 
TX02: Our first festival destination was the Apple Festival at 
the St. John's United Church of Christ in Egg Harbor City. 
The 
Reverend Dr. Richard A. Ruof was walking around the grounds and 
we obtained permission from him to do our work there. 
He 
introduced us to Ruth Ellen Gronlund, who has been the main force 
behind the Apple Festival since its inception six years ago. 
This year, however, she was not in charge, but was there as a 
supporter. 
She said that the festival 
is an all—church effort 
and 
is partially aimed at drawing the members together. 
The 
group responsible for putting on the festival 
is called the Apple 
Corps (the pun 
is 
intended). 
They have always raffled a quilt at 
the festival--but the local women did not know how to quilt 
before the first Apple Festival. 
A Vermont woman named Amy Brown 
taught the women to quilt, and each year they do a more 
complicated one, always from a kit. 
This year it was a cross— 
stitch floral pattern with decorative quilting. 
The second prize 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 36 
in the raffle was an off—white afghan, and the third prize was a 
macrame handbag. 
Mrs. Gronlund outlined the purposes of the festival as three: 
1. 
To raise money; 2. 
To increase the church's visibility in the 
community; and 3. 
To have one all—church project per year. 
The 
tents used to shelter the booths were rented from, to quote Mrs. 
Gronlund, "the friendly local undertaker." 
We were introduced to Helen Zimmer, Heidelberg Avenue, Egg 
Harbor RD 2, 08215, phone 365-0266, who was 
in charge of the 
festival this year and who did pine cone and dried arrangements 
that were sold there. 
She raises straw flowers, gathers plants 
in the woods, and can name many of the native plants. 
She put 
some bittersweet in the oven to open it up before the festival 
since it wasn't open yet. 
She also makes dandelion wine, which 
she joked about not letting other people know that she made. 
The 
women told us about the church's Harvest Home service that will 
be held Sunday, Oct. 2 at 11 
am. 
They said that their church was 
originally the German Reformed Church, and then it was 
consolidated and became known as the United Church of Christ. 
The Harvest Home is a Reformed Church holdover that helps raise 
money for Neighbors in Need, a charitable organization. 
We visited a booth where house plants were for sale as well 
as a plant that was variously called money plant, silver dollar, 
and pennies from heaven. 
It has flat round seed pods that can be 
peeled, exposing a silvery surface that makes they popular for 
dried arrangements. 
Usually, the pods can be rubbed between two 
fingers and the skin slips off. 
Today, though, the women were 
fussing because they weren't coming off the way they should, and 
they were stopping at the booth and attempting to diagnose the 
reason why they weren't working. 
One said they were picked too 
early. 
Another said they got wet and hadn't dried out properly. 
Another plant they had for sale was called the pregnant mother 
plant or the pregnant plant because of 
its reproduction of many 
tiny seedlings all 
around it, much like a spider plant. 
The conversation turned to clams while we were standing 
there and Doris Siciliano, one of the women running the 
house plant booth, told us that the trouble with the clam business 
is that the Russians are taking all 
the clams. 
She said you 
could stand on the shore at night and 
it 
looked like a city out 
on the water, there were so many Russian boats. 
Halfway between Egg Harbor City and Elwood is an all—Polish 
area. 
We went into the church at the prompting of several children 
running around the grounds calling, "Puppet show in five 
minutes!" 
They were putting on a puppet show based on a fairy 
tale that their adult advisor had seen performed somewhere else 
by adults. 
The advisor, Mrs. Barlow, wrote the play out from 
memory and directed the children in putting it on with hand 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 37 
puppets. 
The stage had backdrops of sheets, sets of cardboard, 
and plastic doll furniture. 
The children apparently were 
entirely responsible for all 
aspects of the performance, 
including set changes, and they rotated roles with each 
performance--we overheard them asking Mrs. Barlow if they could 
please be the witch next time, or Jacob, or the narrator. 
There 
was a buzz as we came in with our fancy tape recorder and 
cameras, and one girl, after some loud whispering came out from 
behind the stage, took one look at me with my headphones on, and 
loudly said, "Oh, my God!" 
The play was introduced with a 
scripture about laying up treasures, then it proceeded. 
I didn't 
know that the lid on Sue's Nagra didn't fit properly, causing the 
tape to bunch up, 
so I missed getting the very beginning of the 
performance on tape. 
Several of the children had visited the 
clown makeup booth outside, so had their faces made up. 
They 
thought we were from the news at first, but we explained who we 
were and they still seemed impressed, judging from the whispers 
behind the curtain about "Library of Congress." 
We went back outside after the show and returned to the 
plant booth hoping to tape some the women there--we hadn't had 
the Nagra with us to begin with. 
We got a little background on 
them and got their names: 
Doris Siciliano, Rt. 1 Box 390, 
Hammonton, NJ 
08037; and Marie Alber, 426 Philadelphia Avenue, 
Egg Harbor City, NJ, 08215. 
TX03: Our next visit was to the Renault Winery where they were 
having their "Skin and Bones" weekend as part of their eight—week 
Harvest Festival. 
They were serving barbecued spare ribs, I 
think, with potato skins, hence the name. 
Among other things, 
they had a grape stomping contest, classic car display and 
contest, a singer with a guitar, tours of the winery, and the 
real focus of the affair, wine sales. 
Here was an entirely 
different kind of festival and people. 
There was no sense of 
community, of course, as there had been at the church. 
The 
people there were largely "beautiful" urban types. 
When I was 
taping the grape stomping contest, I was getting heckled by a 
couple of men from New York City wearing gold chains and designer 
sweaters. 
There were foursomes from the city, much like I have 
seen at the Hollywood Bowl 
in Los Angeles--two couples dress up 
(in a casual sort of way, of course) and head for an outdoor 
folksy kind of experience sipping wine and sophisticatedly 
conversing. 
I wanted to go back to the Apple Festival. 
This 
place was so self—conscious it made me self—conscious. 
I taped 
while Sue interviewed the PR woman from the winery. 
TX04: We left the winery and headed for a fire company dinner we 
had seen advertised. 
It was held in Lower Bank, and was a roast 
beef dinner. 
There were men with walkie—talkies directing 
parking of cars, and we stopped to talk with one of them after we 
parked our car. 
His name was Warren Homiller, 965-3469 (phone), 
Egg Harbor RD 2. 
He didn't have a lot of time, but told us that 
to advertise these dinners they place posters for twenty miles 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 38 
around and send direct—mail reminders to people who have attended 
in the past (they get their names and addresses from the door 
prize stubs). 
The Lower Bank Volunteer Fire Company is No. 452 in 
Burlington County. 
That is their dispatch number--their trucks 
are numbered 4521, 4522, 4523, etc. 
They are dispatched out of 
Burlington Co. Central Dispatch, which should have a list for us 
of all the fire companies in the county. 
Other counties may be 
different. 
The people attending the dinner were all 
adults, many senior 
citizens, and there were visitors from all 
over. 
Warren said 
that the 
local people are very good about supporting these 
dinners, but the few people we talked to were al► from other 
areas. 
Some of them were campers. 
One couple called themselves 
seasonal campers--the man 
is the fire chief 
in Elizabeth, I 
believe, 
in central Jersey. 
They come and camp from about April 
through October, and see the weekend campers as amateurs and 
intruders. 
They live in a camp trailer at a nearby campground 
and put their reservations in for the next year while they are 
here. 
They said they always come to these dinners. 
Warren said that the cinderblock fire house is really the 
community hall for all 
local events that need a building--
weddings, parties, anniversaries, are all housed here. 
There was 
a large well—equipped kitchen with an industrial—sized mixer that 
I glimpsed. 
Community women, not necessarily only firemen's 
wives, help prepare the meal, and local adolescent girls do the 
serving. 
There are coffee cans with slits in the lids labelled 
"Tips" on every table, and diners put money in them for the 
servers, who divide up the pot at the end of the evening. 
The 
meal consisted of roast beef, coleslaw (again with the 
coleslaw!), beans, a beverage, potatoes with gravy, and dessert. 
Sue had a blueberry pie, and I had an excellent cranberry nut pie 
that resembled a cobbler. 
The door prize (really a raffle--I 
paid a dollar for a chance) was a painted wooden duck decoy. The 
people didn't have time to talk much, so we didn't find out where 
the decoy came from or who made it. 
The dinner cost $5.00.

Spent most of today in Philadelphia, where Sue, Christine 
and I went to hear a colloquium by Simon Bronner. 
In the 
evening, however, we attended the meeting of the Pinelands 
Interpretation Committee held at the National Park Service Nature 
Center near Estell Manor. 
The committee, whose meetings Mary and 
Sue have attended in the past, 
is designed to come up with an 
interpretive plan for the Pinelands Reserve. 
As a newcomer, my 
impression was that these were all well—intentioned people, but 
all 
outsiders attempting to interpret the pines to outsiders. 
I 
don't know how many pines natives were among them. 
Daily I 
become more aware of the fact that there 
is no single Pinelands. 
Every informant I talk to has a different opinion on where the 
pines are, who the pineys are, and how the place should be 
managed. 
The only thing they all 
agree on 
is that they all 
hate 
the Pinelands Commission. 
The meeting gave me a sense of the Big 
Brother feeling that some of the local people feel--who are these 
people telling the pines residents what to do. 
It 
is a very 
knotty problem that includes concerns over local control, 
environmental protection, development, individual rights and 
government prerogatives, among other things.

Spent yesterday trying to catch up on paperwork--still not 
caught up. 
Mal 
and Bonnie came and I worked with them a little 
on the Kaypros--it's good that they made the trip, because they 
will be here so 
little each week, they need every headstart they 
can get so they don't use up all 
their field time learning the 
equipment. 
I think they are planning to be here about 1-1/2 to 2 
days per week. 
It took us at least that long to 
learn all 
the 
gear. 
This morning I went to G—May's Landing; 10GT to visit with 
Charles Dupras, the newly—retired agricultural agent for Atlantic 
County. 
I didn't know what I would get from him because when I 
phoned for the appointment and told him what we were doing, he 
said, "Aren't you people re—inventing the wheel? 
The Pinelands 
have been studied over and over." 
However, upon my arrival he 
was very gracious and helpful--there had been an article in The 
Press this morning about our project and 
it explained further to 
him what we were doing. 
Dupras came to May's Landing in 1953 from Trenton. 
He 
thought the south Jersey people would not be as aggressive and 
industrious as he found them to be after his arrival. 
He gave me 
a rundown of the agricultural history of Atlantic County and 
promised to send us a copy of the script of a slide—tape 
presentation he did on the subject. 
Briefly, the story is that 
the earliest settlement occurred on the Egg Harbor and Mullica 
Rivers, and south Jersey was known as the breadbasket of the pre— 
revolutionary period. 
With the coming of the railroads in the 
mid-1800s came the two main ethnic groups: 
Germans (Egg Harbor 
City to Pomona) and Italians (Landisville, Hammonton, Vineland). 
As 
land was cleared for Gloucester Furnace charcoal, the Germans 
bought small farms. 
Some Italians were brought in by George 
Landis in the 1850s and 60s. 
But the real development occurred 
with the Italians from Rome and south of Rome, who were more 
aggressive and willing to take risks in business. 
Northern 
Italians settled Landisville and E. Vineland, and they were more 
conservative in their approach to agriculture. 
There is a North 
Italy Hall 
in E. Vineland--a social group. 
Dupras himself is 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 41 
married to a woman of north Italian ancestry, and he said, "Don't 
confuse the two groups. 
It makes a difference." 
He said the 
north Italians sort of 
look down on the Rome—south Italians and 
still carry a feeling of "you have to watch them." 
The south 
Italians quickly developed large farms and adopted new farming 
methods as they were developed. 
Contacts among farming families 
in this region: 
Mrs. Grunow. 
Her sons Ernest and Willard operate Grunow 
Farm on Monheim Avenue. G—Egg Harbor City; 
05GT(?) 
Joseph Sahl. 
Their farm is over 100 years 
in the same name. 
The Liepe brothers. 
Allwin "Buddy" Liepe. 
Also a farm that 
has been in the family for over 100 years. 
Carl Liepe is next door to a nursery he ran for years but has 
sold. 
Atlantic Nursery. 
He really knows native plants. 
G—Hamilton Twp.; 1OGT(?) 
In the 1940s many Jews settled in the area as they escaped from 
Europe and went into the poultry business until 
it declined, then 
they went into other businesses. 
Most of the agricultural area is 
in Landisville, E. 
Vineland, and Hammonton. 
Until the 1960s there were lots of 
small farms. 
They have since sold out to the larger ones. 
Contacts in the area:

Italy. 561-2035.

Louis Dalponte--G—Richland; 03GT 
697-3346. 
Grapes have always grown well here--four old wineries are 
in 
Atlantic County: 
Gross, Renault, Tomasello, and Balic. 
Germans 
and Italians always have made wine. 
Atlantic Co. 
is second in the state for peaches and first in 
sweet potatoes. 
The current top crop in the area is vegetables--
there are 30 to 50 types. 
Eggplant is popular here and 
is a big 
crop because blacks, Hispanics and Italians like them. 
Atlantic 
County is eleventh in the nation for eggplant production. 
Blueberries are a major crop in Atlantic Co., with 4500 acres as 
opposed to 2500 acres in Burlington Co. 
Here is where the 
gambling spirit of the Italian farmers in Hammonton paid off. 
They were willing to yank out their old blueberry plants and try 
out new varieties as they were developed. 
The more conservative 
farmers in Burlington Co. didn't do that and now no longer lead 
in the blueberry market. 
Workers now prefer to work 
in Atlantic 
County blueberry fields because it takes less time to fill 
up a 
basket with the larger berries. 
The Galletta Brothers are the 
largest blueberry growers in the world. 
Duke Galletta would be a 
good resource. 
In Burlington County, Bill Haines 
(Blueberry 
Bill Haines, not Apple Bill Haines--they are cousins) would be a 
good contact. 
There used to be strawberries, but there aren't anymore 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 42 
because the Dept. of Labor instituted minimum wage instead of a 
piece rate. 
Now winos come and work just enough to get money for 
wine, but don't really work. 
Now many workers come from Puerto 
Rico through the Glassboro Labor Camp and the Dept of Labor. 
Some of the workers return year after year to the same farms and 
develop close relationships with the growers. 
Tourism is probably the number one industry in the area 
(because of the casinos). 
Agriculture is probably second. 
One thing that Dupras said--"Burlington County is the pines. 
We're not the pines--you put us there!" 
I said, "I didn't put 
you there!" 
Farmers detest the Pinelands Commission because they 
were put 
in agricultural zones and property values dropped. 
They 
feel compensation should have been made for the difference 
between the agricultural value and the development value that 
they lost the minute the Pinelands plan went into effect. 
Dupras emphasized to me that I should not have an 
image of 
these farmers as hicks. 
"They are smart--they're sharp 
businessmen." 
As examples he cited Apple Bill Haines, who 
is an 
assemblyman and Cranberry Bill Haines, who 
is a good businessman 
in the cranberry business. 
He referred me to Phil Marucci, G—Oswego Research Center; 26GT 
(a Rutgers substation), north of Jenkins Neck, (609) 726-1020. 
He knows all 
of the pineys and blueberry culture.

Supply--from a long—time agricultural family. 
Angelo Bylone, 691-8289, G—E. Vineland; 03GT sweet potato 
grower. He also gave me the name of the woman who was mentioned 
by Charlene at Atlantic Co. Extension. 
She belongs to some local 
crafts guild and has organized fairs or something:

TX02: 
In the evening, Sue and I went to G—Hammonton; 11GT to meet 
Ralph Putiri, who was going to take us to a local restaurant 
where they have a weekly spaghetti night. 
Ralph's cousin Floyd 
Bird also went, and Mr. Putiri stayed home where we planned to 
meet him at nine for a taping session. 
The restaurant was a 
custard stand that is only open during the summer months, and 
this was the last week of operation for this season, and the last 
spaghetti night. 
The cafe, called Toni's Custard, 
is 
run by Toni 
Marinella and her family. 
Her husband Ed 
is a state trooper. 
Spaghetti night is a product of the efforts of Toni, her mother, 
Ed's mother, Toni's aunt Clara, and some other family members. 
The older women prepare homemade pasta and spaghetti sauce with 
meatballs and sausage, then they sit in the corner and talk when 
they are not needed 
in the kitchen. 
There weren't as many people 
in the place this time as usual, according to Ralph, who usually 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 43 
expects to run 
into friends and acquaintances when he goes there. 
The women proved to be extremely helpful, especially Clara, who 
talked to Sue at length about her canning and cooking. 
She said 
they (the women in the family) have a "can house" where they do 
all 
their canning. 
It 
is a garage with three stoves in 
it and a 
sink, so all 
the mess and heat is not in the house. 
They do 
peppers, fruit, vegetables, you name it. 
Toni brought out an 
example of roast peppers, which are put in the oven and roasted 
until you can slip the skin off. 
Then they got into a discussion 
of how you can eat them--in sandwiches, for instance. 
Ralph 
favored having a plain pepper and bread sandwich, and had us try 
it. 
Floyd said you had to squeeze the bread down on the peppers 
to make 
it really good. 
(The bread was provided by a local 
wholesale Italian bakery.) 
Another favorite sandwich was roast 
peppers and square cheese. 
("What kind of cheese?" 
"Oh, any 
kind of square cheese will do. ") 
I still don't know what square 
cheese is. 
Clara (her last name was Paolino) mentioned that she made 
cranberry sauce, and said it was a basic cooked kind. 
I asked if 
she put oranges 
in 
it and she said no--"I only use what I have." 
If she doesn't have something on hand, she doesn't go out and 
find 
it. 
She doesn't put orange 
in peach marmalade for the same 
reason. 
I asked her about yardscapes, and asked what her yard was 
like. 
She said that it was somewhat neglected at the moment, but 
that her niece had a yard that was more like a park than a yard, 
with an antique bell and coach in 
it and flowers and everything. 
She thought it was quite beautiful. 
I asked if the women and men 
share 
in the yard work around here, or 
if 
it 
is the job of just 
one sex. 
She said that most of the people share the work, but 
then she made a more revealing statement: 
"The women help out 
a lot." 
In other words, 
it 
is the male domain, but the women 
help. 
Clara looked like she was 
in her fifties. 
While Sue talked to Ralph and the women, I took some 
pictures, realizing with chagrin that I had left the Nikons on 
the kitchen chair back at the office. 
Luckily, I had my camera 
with me, but only had a 50mm lens. 
Because of the situations we 
were in, 
that proved not to be much of a handicap. 
The place was 
lit with yellow bug lights, so I didn't even attempt to use color 
film. 
TX03: We returned to the Putiri home G—Elwood; 12GT and startled 
Mr. Putiri with all 
our high—tech equipment we began to set up. 
He didn't know how serious we were about all 
this! 
I took 
pictures while Sue handled the tapes and asked questions. 
Mr. 
Putiri talked about how he got into the fruit business from 
almost nothing after World War II. 
It turned out that he has 
been active in politics for years, and has been mayor of G—Mullica 
township; 12GT and thinks that maybe he will be again sometime, as 
he 
is still active on the council. 
He was very helpful and 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 44 
offered to take us on a walk 
in the woods to show us the native 
plants and mushrooms he 
is familiar with. 
We drank fresh apple 
cider and they gave us some to take home with us, along with 
samples of the cranberry nut cake they sell at the stand. 
Earlier in the evening, Sue sampled the homemade grape wine they 
had been given by a relative. 
Ralph 
is president of the local Gideons camp and invited us 
to their next meeting on the fourth Tuesday in October at the 
Olympus Diner. 
He 
is very religious and asked me extensive 
questions about my religion when he found out that I was Mormon. 
He mentioned that the Gideons are a cross—denominational 
organization, and they are not allowed to discuss doctrines of 
their churches at meetings. 
There are a few denominations that 
are not welcome in the Gideons, and women cannot be members 
unless they have husbands who are members. 
It is a national 
organization with a large guidebook that explains all 
the rules 
and regulations. 
Only professional men are welcome--not store 
clerks, for instance, he said. 
We finished the session about llpm, after Ralph played a 
couple of hymns haltingly on the piano. 
We feel that the Putiris 
will 
be very valuable informants--they have been deeply involved 
in the local scene for many years, and are good talkers and very 
friendly. 
They showed us a box of family pictures, some of which 
should probably be copied--especially those dealing with the 
development of their fruit stand. 
Before we left for the restaurant earlier in the evening, 
Floyd went over to close the stand, and I asked Mr. Putiri 
if 
they have any security or a watchdog or something, and he pointed 
to a rifle that was standing in the corner of the room. 
He said 
he had to use 
it once to get an irate customer to 
leave. 
But if 
someone comes and burglarizes the stand, he said, what do they 
get--a basket of apples? 
"That's not that much." 
TX04: I neglected to mention that after leaving Charles Dupras, I 
drove to the Hamilton Township police station and spoke with 
Chief Ronald W. Martin and his secretary. 
The main economic base 
for May's Landing, according to the chief, 
is the casinos 
in 
Atlantic City. 
Many people work there and commute from May's 
Landing. 
There are also some small 
industries, and a few old 
clammers around. 
Charlie Caine was a clammer the chief named. 
I 
asked about ethnic groups, saying I had heard there is a Russian 
community in G—May's Landing; 10GT. 
The Russians are getting old 
now. 
Many of them do not speak English, and the chief referred 
me to Barbara Roden (625-1212) at the Senior Citizen's center 
next door to the police station. 
I met her briefly as I was 
leaving and told her I would call for an appointment. 
She said 
they have an 
interpreter who would be a good Russian contact. 
There is a Russian Orthodox church on Hudson Street--they weren't 
sure 
if 
it was open any more. 
I drove by it later, and 
it 
looks 
kept—up, but pretty unused. 
The chief said that he liked having 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 45 
the Russians in town because they fixed up their houses 
constantly and were very clean. 
The second—generation Russians 
have virtually disappeared, either by assimilation or by leaving 
town. 
The chief thought it was the latter, but he did mention 
Leon Steffe, a second—generation one. 
Other ethnic groups 
in the area include blacks and 
hispanics. 
There 
is a black community at Mizpah and Bear's Head 
(Millville Road--turn at Jacob's Chevy—Olds onto Rt. 552). 
Pat 
Sheola, 
in the same building as the senior citizens' center, 
might know some contacts in those communities. 
Hispanics tend to 
live 
in the blueberry areas--like near the 
Atlantic Blueberry Company on Rt. 559 toward Hammonton. 
They are 
mostly Puerto Rican--maybe some Haitians. 
They handle their own 
problems, not calling in the police very often. 
The summer 
workers cause more problems than the hispanics. 
G—Egg Harbor 
City; 05GT and G—Vineland; 39GT are loaded with hispanics. 
Hamilton twp. has lots of senior citizens, and 3/4 of the 
people work outside the township. 
Major employers in the area 
are Wheaton's (a plastic containers fabricator housed in an old 
cotton mill--I have mentioned the building in previous fieldnotes) 
and Plasticoat, a subsidiary of Wheaton's. 
Those are the only 
industry 
in the twp. that the chief could think of. 
Chief Martin commented that he has been 
in May's Landing for 
27 years, but 
is still an outsider. 
He says the natives never 
wanted to expand here. 
There used to be a movie theater, an 
Acme, and other signs of progress in his eyes, but they have all 
left and have not been replaced. 
The only sign of progress in 
the area is the McDonald's. 
The local politicians are blaming a 
lot of the lack of growth on the Pinelands Commission, but the 
chief thinks that it 
is really their backward attitudes that are 
to blame. 
There are five volunteer fire companies and two volunteer 
rescue squads 
in the township, and they are dispatched out of the 
Hamilton Twp. police dept. 
The fire companies are 
in Mizpah, 
Cologne, Laureldale, Weymouth, and May's Landing. 
The chief says 
that he has always gotten along with the fire companies, while 
other police haven't, because they use his dispatch--they have to 
cooperate. 
He didn't really expand on what kinds of trouble 
others may have with the companies, although I asked. 
He 
indicated that the fire companies carry a lot of weight with 
local politicians and recently each of them got a new fire truck. 
The politicians perceive the firemen as so many votes that they 
have to keep happy. 
I think it 
is more the fact that they are 
volunteers and must be kept happy so essential services won't be 
lost. 
Newcomers to the community, however, do not recognize the 
clout and importance of the volunteer fire companies the way old 
timers do. 
Politicians, though, still 
listen to the fire 
companies to a large degree, causing Chief Martin to feel the 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 46 
politicians are behind the times. 
TX05: 
A few notes from my taped observations while driving: 
G—Green Bank; 26GT and G—Lower Bank; 26GT seem to have more 
in 
the way of borders on yards than some other communities: 
railroad 
ties, rocks, cinder blocks, fences, hedges. 
G—Weekstown; 12GT Vol. Fire Co. on Rt. 563. 
New homes on the approach to G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT on Rt. 
563 are 
in the woods and have lots of fences, terraces, etc. 
Further in on the right is a house with white picket fences that 
are on a slant, directing the visitor down the drives. 
Beyond 
the lawn, 
in front of the house itself, 
is a row of trees, then a 
white picket fence with a Virgin Mary in front of 
it. 
The fence 
configuration is more of a welcoming and defining one than one 
designed to keep people out. 
G—Laureldale; IOGT Vol. Fire Co. 
is on the right (west) 
between May's Landing and Egg Harbor City on Rt. 50. 
G—May's Landing; IOGT Vol. Rescue Squad on Rt. 50 coming into 
town from the north. 
Egg Harbor Boat Company is on Rt. 50 near the intersection 
with Rt. 561 coming northward out of G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT.

TX02: I visited with Bill Hengst, the city planner for 
G—Chesilhurst Borough; 31GT at the borough town hall. 
He 
is a 
planner working out of Philadelphia and comes to Chesilhurst two 
days a week, so really had few contacts and little feeling for 
the community. 
He mentioned that the largest industry in the 
borough at present is a small steel fabricating plant that has 
10-15 employees. 
Its economic base 
is 
largely outside the 
borough--many people commute to larger areas to work. 
There are 
commercial establishments--small ones--all along the highway 
going through town. 
They have mounted a campaign to develop a 
small 
industrial park that will attract light industry to the 
area. 
It 
is hoped that this move will 
increase the tax base. 
The largest employers in the borough are the borough and the 
school board. 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 48 
Chesilhurst was laid out as a planned community by 
developers who hoped to make it into a prosperous suburb, a goal 
which was not reached until a century after it was first set up 
on a grid system. 
Hengst recommended that a good contact in the area would be 
Ed Wanzer, the mayor—elect (609-757-4415). 
Dominic Rocco (768-0722) 
is a woodcutter in G—Waterford Twp.; 
32GT, who 
is trained in "urban skills," as Hengst put it, 
but is 
now a woodcutter. 
Also 
in Waterford Twp. 
is Leah Wilhelm (767-
0295), whose family has been there a long time and whose brother 
is Joe Maressa, and attorney and former state senator. 
Hengst said that Chesilhurst was probably originally a white 
community, but now 
is 2/3 black. 
G—Winslow Twp.; 33GT has a high 
Italian population. 
It also has a belt of heavy industry 
northwest of Chesilhurst. 
I noticed at one house in G—Chesilhurst; 31GT on Garfield 
Avenue, there was one of those yard statues of a black groom, and 
the face and hands had been painted white with plain white paint. 
There were several yards with bird baths and various forms of 
bordering around flower beds. 
Also on Garfield, there was a 
house with a tree stump 
in the yard that was decorated with hub 
caps and flowers. 
The Elmhurst Vol. Fire Dept. advertised a Boy Scout Pancake 
supper to be held Sunday, Oct. 2, at 7:30, I believe. 
TX03: On G—Rt. 536; 32GT between Waterford Works and Rt. 206 is a 
large field with cut wood for sale. 
It 
is beautifully and neatly 
stacked in cord and half—cord bins. 
I couldn't raise anyone at 
the house nearby, but there was a man loading wood onto his truck 
who had bought it for $85 a cord. 
The price varies, he says, 
depending on how you have it cut. 
He came from Weekstown, which 
he seemed to think was a long way to come for wood, although it 
really isn't all that far. 
The place is barely off Highway 206. 
He heats his whole house using a wood furnace and about three 
cords of wood per winter. 
TX04: On my way back from Chesilhurst, I stopped south of G—Red 
Lion; 23GT on Rt. 206 to visit with a man selling potatoes out of 
a van. 
His name was Bill Schmale, 7 Woodburn Avenue, Pine Hill, 
NJ 
06021. 
He said that he buys potatoes and sells them here at 
this spot all 
the time. 
He never goes to another place. 
He has 
a peddler's license from the state, and just sits there 
in his 
beat—up blue van with a couple of friends waiting for customers 
to stop. 
He said that when the Jersey potatoes run out, he buys 
Maine potatoes. 
This, according to him, 
is his only source of 
income. 
He was sitting with a couple of other characters, one of 
whom asked me 
if I was with the people who came to the auction at 
Thatcher--83 Fieldnotes 
page 49 
Tabernacle the other night--that was Jens, Christine, and Mary. 
This man gave his name as "Horseshoe Jack" Bradley, Kramer Road, 
G—Tabernacle; 25GT and he said he 
is a horseshoer. 
I wasn't sure 
whether he was on the level, so asked him whether he does hot or 
cold shoeing, and that must have signalled him that I knew 
something about horses, and he began to talk about horses and the 
horse auction to be held Friday night at the same place 
in 
Tabernacle. 
He said that New Jersey is the second biggest state 
in the nation for horse raising. 
(By the way, he said he did 
both kinds of shoeing, and that he learned it from his father and 
grandfather,) 
The men 
in the van got talking about a move to secede south 
Jersey from north Jersey because all the resources go to the 
north and all 
the south does 
is pay. 
They supported the idea, 
although, I didn't get the idea that they really thought it would 
work. 
I asked the men 
if they knew of any cock fighting in the 
area and 
if any fighting cocks were sold at the auction the other 
night. 
They said, "Sure there were." 
They indicated that most 
of the cockfighting takes place among Puerto Ricans.

TX01: 
Today I visited with George Heinrichs, a third—generation 
sneakbox maker of North Maple Avenue in G—New Gretna; 15GT. 
He 
is 
originally from Tuckerton, and did not begin to build sneakboxes 
until his father became ill 
and was concerned about having 
someone to pass the skill 
on to. 
This was 
in 1972. 
His house 
is 
small, and he has outside doors on his basement so he can build 
the boats in the basement and carry them out when they are 
finished. 
(See tapes PFP83—RET009 and PFP83—RET010.) 
Sneakboxes 
are basically used for duck hunting, but also can be used for 
"picking up" clams in the winter. 
Then clams get forced upward 
by the ice, and they are weakened by cold, so they can be easily 
picked up with a short—handled rake. 
I asked him if there are other boat builders like himself 
in 
the area, and he named Sam Hunt of Waretown who builds 
sneakboxes, but that was about it. 
When I asked him what will 
duck hunters do when there are no more sneakbox builders, he said 
they would have to use other boats or go to gunning boxes, which 
are stationary platforms in the grass. 
They are also called 
sinkboxes, used for sink blind gunning. 
He was also concerned 
about what would happen when Jersey white cedar was no longer 
available, because it 
is the only appropriate wood that is 
light 
enough to make the boats out of. 
He said that there is 
less and 
I 
ess of 
it. 
Since the detailed information on the interview is 
in the 
tape log, I will concentrate on impressions of George and his 
house. 
The house was very dark, and he didn't turn on any 
lights 
until I asked him to so that I could see into my duffle bag. 
He 
was very friendly, and seemed pleased that we were interested in 
his work. 
He told me that Mary had visited him before, but no 
other people had interviewed him about his boats before, which 
sort of surprised me. 
It seems that newspapers like this sort of 
thing, but they have not found him. 
He was sorry that he had to 
miss the festival 
in Washington that Mary had invited him to 
participate in, but he said he would have lost his job. 
He hopes 
to pursue sneakbox making more after he retires. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 51 
He has a garden, which I did not see because it was pouring 
rain, but he told me that he raises lima beans as a cash crop, 
and his wife shells them for sale G—New Gretna; 15GT. 
They sell 
the beans by word of mouth. 
They don't have to try to sell them 
to a market, nor do they advertise with signs or anything else. 
There was a flat of shelled beans on the kitchen table which I 
attempted to photograph, but light conditions were very bad. 
I 
hope we get something. 
I knew that the moment was now or never, 
as the lima bean crop would be over in a week or so, and if I 
came back for the purpose of photographing the beans, they might 
present them in a dressed—up way. 
The house was very clean, and there were crocheted doilies 
and afghans all over the place. 
The basement was interesting--it 
is George's workshop, and 
is fairly well—lit over his workbench 
and jig, but very dark elsewhere. 
Coming down the stairs, I 
noticed that boxes, jars, shoes, and many other things were 
stacked along both sides of the stairway, which was open on both 
sides. 
At the bottom of the stairs 
is a post on which hang some 
jackets and a net bag full of yellow onions that came out of 
George's garden. 
He said something about them being small this 
year. They were, on the average, about two inches 
in diameter. 
They were very pretty in the yellow mesh bag, but, again, the 
light was very bad. 
(Since he told me that he didn't have a 
sneakbox in process, I had not expected to do much picture— 
taking.) 
On the left side of the stairs as we came down was a 
row of peck baskets with dry 
lima beans in the shell 
in them. 
I 
might add that the peck baskets are not of the type that I am 
used to. 
They are tall and narrow and are of a fairly open 
weave. 
We moved a couple of them into the light by the jig so 
that I could get a picture. 
A clothesline was strung between 
posts 
in the basement, and there were old—fashioned clip—type 
clothespins on the 
line, not spring—loaded ones. 
To the far left 
as we came down the stairs, against the north wall, was a stack 
of cedar planks that George uses in building his boats. 
He had 
two different thicknesses, a thicker one for structural parts, 
and a thinner one (I think he said 3/8") for planking the sides. 
In the living room, on a bookcase, there was a miniature 
sneakbox complete with hunter and decoys, that was carved by 
George's brother who 
is a mechanic. 
The brother is not 
interested in making sneakboxes, but he did make several of these 
miniatures for family members.G—New Gretna; 15GT 
George also 
mentioned Don Helfrich or Helfridge of G—Tuckerton; 47GT, who makes 
mini—sneakboxes and garveys. 
His phone number is 296-8565. 
As I was cleaning up the sound equipment, George told me 
that he had a picture of the Jersey Devil--a photograph. 
We had 
been talking about fire companies, and I had asked him if 
he had 
ever been 
in one. 
He said that he had always been at all 
the 
fires, but he had never been a member of a volunteer fire 
company. 
Then he brought up the picture. 
He said, "I call 
it a 
smoke phenomenon." 
He dug around and found the picture, which 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 52 
was a copy of a Polaroid shot taken by his nephew during a forest 
fire 
in which four men died in a fire truck. 
The picture was 
taken minutes after the men died, and shows a shadowy shape in 
the smoke above the trees. 
George pointed out the shoulders, the 
horns and face of the devil 
in the smoke. 
He seemed to be 
standing on the fence of belief and non—belief, so I said, "What 
do you think the Jersey Devil 
is?" 
"A hoax." 
But then he 
proceeded to say that there was something in that smoke, and 
seemed to allow that there might be a Jersey Devil after all. 
I 
think he believes, but will not admit it, and 
is not sure exactly 
what he believes in. 
He supported his interpretation of the 
picture with a story of a photo he had seen 
in the newspaper of a 
fire 
in the hallway of a building in which a shadowy figure 
appears. 
He said he believed that figure was Jesus or an angel. 
His nephew sold several copies of the photograph, and I asked if 
we might be able to get one. 
He said he would ask his nephew. 
Apparently the picture was copied into black and white and 
printed in the newspaper, but it did not show up well. 
He said 
you couldn't see the image at all. G—New Gretna; 15GT 
TX02: After I finished with Mr. Heinrichs, I went to the New 
Gretna Caterers (used to be called the New Gretna Bake Shop) and 
spoke to the woman who works there while I bought some more 
blueberry preserves.G—New Gretna; 15GT 
It turns out she 
is from 
Connecticut and New York, and moved here recently after divorcing 
her husband. 
He was working in Atlantic City and commuting there 
during the week and coming home to her up north on the weekends. 
She went to surprise him one day with some homemade goodies and 
found him living with another woman during the week. 
Now she is 
remarried and living 
in New Gretna and 
is 
in the process of 
expanding her bakery business into a catering business. 
I 
mentioned her preserves in PFP83—FET0922, page 2. 
She uses local 
blueberries, but buys California strawberries for her strawberry 
preserves because she says local strawberries are too watery and 
lacking 
in good color, and she won't use artificial color. 
TX03: I returned to the office to join Sue for a fire company 
turkey dinner in Cologne. 
It was the Germania Fire Company 
G—Cologne; 09GT, and 
it was quite different from the one we 
attended in Lower Bank last week. 
Here the firehouse was fancy 
nouveau—Germanic architecture, and was quite large. 
The dinner 
was served upstairs in a large hall with plaques on the walls 
honoring old firemen--all the names were German names. 
There were several 
large signs on the White Horse Pike 
directing people to the dinner, and at the corner of Cologne 
Avenue, on which the firehouse is situated, there was a sign and 
a red fire truck to attract attention. 
We drove into the dirt parking lot and were directed to 
parking places by several men, just like at the Lower Bank 
dinner. 
This parking lot had been temporarily marked with chalk 
or lime so that there were marked diagonal parking places. 
There 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 53 
was a line that was steadily increasing in 
length, and 
it wound 
through two truck garage—type rooms without the trucks and 
separated into take—out and eat—in lines 
in the second room. 
The 
directions were written in magic marker on cardboard signs. 
In 
the corner of the second room was a small bar where a fireman was 
dispensing small glasses of beer for 50 cents. 
There was also a 
raffle table selling chances to win one of several prizes, 
including dinner for two at a local 
restaurant and tickets to the 
next firehouse dinner. 
There were other prizes mentioned, but I 
can't remember them. 
They are recorded in the photographs. 
We approached the ticket table and spoke to the men there. 
They were dressed in suits and looked like businessmen, with 
well—trimmed hair and an easy manner. 
They told us that they 
expected to serve 1100-1200 people that night, and they always 
had pork as well as turkey, but they didn't advertise it. 
The 
dinner was put on exclusively by fire company members and their 
wives--no other community members, except for the young girls who 
served as waitresses. 
The women all cook turkeys--they said they 
had 1600 lbs. of turkey for that evening, and the men cut them up 
early in the day of the dinner. 
(Later, as we came out, they 
said they had already hit the 1150 mark in customers, and they 
were cooking two more turkeys.) 
There are no female fire 
fighters in this company, unlike some companies that Jens found 
where the women mind the firehouse during the day while their 
husbands commute to work, and the men are on call 
at night. 
We paid our money ($5.50 per person), and waited until 
the 
usher upstairs signalled the men near us that there was room for 
US. 
There was one of those stair chair—lifts for elderly people. 
We went upstairs and were escorted to two places at one of the 
long tables. 
The people around us were mostly in their sixties 
or older, I would guess, although this dinner seemed to have more 
young people attending than the Lower Bank one did. 
However, 
it 
does not seem to be the place to be 
if you are an adolescent. 
I 
don't think I saw any there unless they were waiting on tables. 
The people around us were very friendly and interested in what we 
were doing with the cameras and notes. 
One man, who now teaches 
high school 
in Egg Harbor City (?) said that he was a piney and 
that Fred Brown of McPhee's book 
is a relative of his. 
He said 
he was from Lower Bank. 
His wife told us that he has an accent 
that emerges when he gets together with his family 
in Lower Bank, 
but does not manifest itself 
in other company. 
A woman sitting 
across from me told me that she attends all 
the fire company 
dinners--"It's better than cooking!" 
I said something about 
supporting the community to boot, but that did not seem as 
important to her. 
She was from Egg Harbor City, as I recall. 
She also told us about how active senior citizens are 
in the 
area, citing bingo games at the Church of the Assumption in 
Pomona as a popular activity. 
The tables were laden with bowls of coleslaw, jellied 
cranberry sauce, rolls, and cream for coffee. 
There were also a 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 54 
few small flower arrangements--the one near us was made up of 
small fall flowers like chrysanthemums or zinnias in colors from 
maroon to gold 
in a white florist—type vase. 
We had to wait a 
while after the girl took our orders for pork or turkey, but when 
we got our plates they were really full. 
We had huge helpings of 
sliced turkey with gravy, mashed potatoes with gravy, a square of 
rather dense stuffing, canned peas and carrots, and candied sweet 
potatoes. 
(Sue had sweet potatoes, I had yams--both cooked with 
the same brown sugar kind of recipe. 
We didn't order them that 
way--it seems they just had both 
in the kitchen--perhaps prepared 
by wives at home and brought in.) 
The food was good, although 
the dressing was a weak point. 
The men downstairs had said that 
we wouldn't go away hungry, and if we did, to tell them. 
There 
was an extra charge for beverages other than coffee and tea--we 
paid 25 cents for soda. 
Like at the other dinner, there were tip 
cans on the tables for the waitresses. 
The desserts were laid 
out on a table, but we did not have a choice as to what we got. 
I had a spice cake with white icing that might have had cream 
cheese in 
it. 
(At the Lower Bank dinner, we were given a choice 
of several things for dessert.) 
I took a few pictures of the 
operation at the front of the room where the desserts, 
waitresses, cooks, bar, and everything were, but it was so busy 
that I was something of an obstacle. 
We 
left about 8 pm, and it 
was pouring rain outside, so the traffic directors were wearing 
their firemen's rain gear, looking very official and impressive.

The early part of the day was my own, and I went up to 
church in East Brunswick, driving along 206 north. 
Highway 206 
is 
the boundary of the area we are working in, and 
it 
is bordered 
with 
prosperous—looking farms and small towns. 
In the evening, Joseph, Christine and I recorded a 
"Singspiration" service at the little Landmark Baptist church in 
G—Browns Mills; 21GT that Christine has been attending. 
Earlier in 
the day they had had their worship and sunday school services, 
and from what I gathered, they are more sedate and subdued than 
the evening services. 
The congregation was small and friendly 
with strong group ties. 
The service consisted of singing hymns 
and testifying, so we set up two Sennheiser cartioid mikes 
in the 
rear corners of the small room and two Beyer Dynamic 201s 
in the 
front corners. 
Everything had to be cranked up pretty high to 
get a good signal from some of the testifiers, but the piano was 
overpowering and I had to shut down the mike near it 
in order to 
hear the singers some of the time. 
In the front left corner of the room , just below the 
speaker's platform, a small band played along with the hymns. In 
the front row was a teen—aged girl playing flute and a teen—aged 
boy playing clarinet. 
Behind the girl was Rev. Becker's wife, 
Faith, playing the trumpet and behind the boy was Rev. Becker 
playing saxophone. 
Mrs. Becker didn't get to play trumpet too 
much, though, because the pianist they had hoped would be there 
didn't arrive until 
late 
in the service, so she played the piano. 
Before the service, the kids were warming up on their 
instruments, and Mrs. Becker was constantly coaching them from 
wherever she was in the room at the time. 
Also before the 
service, 
in the second pew on the right (we were occupying the 
first pew with our sound equipment), a woman was pouring grape 
juice into tiny communion glasses and placing them in the round, 
double—decker covered communion tray. 
Plain crackers were broken 
up and placed in two round trays flanking the juice, and all were 
covered with a linen cloth edged with lace (probably crocheted). 
The communion table, which is apparently kept at the back of the 
platform when not in use, was placed in front of the lectern at 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 56 
the center front of the room. 
(A sketch of the layout of the 
room will be filed somewhere in the materials from this study--
perhaps with Christine Cartwright's fieldnotes for this day--
PFP83—FCC1002.) 
While the pastor presided over communion and other official 
parts of the service, such as welcoming and taking leave, much of 
the meeting was directed by Arnold Miller, who is also a pastor, 
but 
is just a member of this congregation. 
He led all 
the 
singing and acted in a sort of cheerleading capacity, asking 
people if they were enjoying the meeting, and getting verbal 
responses from the congregation. 
He would invite people to 
testify, so it appears that everyone had to 
learn to think on his 
feet in case he were to be called upon. 
In other cases, they 
waited for the spirit to move someone to stand and testify. 
They 
stood in their places and told stories of daily life and struggle 
in a fairly conversational manner, but with some phrases common: 
"I want to praise the Lord because . . .," was the most common. 
They seemed to refrain from referring to deity as "God," but 
preferred "the Lord"--I would guess because it 
is 
less like 
taking the name of God 
in vain. 
The young flute player stood and 
told how she had been running for eighth grade vice president, 
and had been praying for the right thing to happen, whether she 
won or lost. 
She won, and was thankful and praised the Lord. 
The congregation responded with murmured approval and praises. 
Mr. Miller, who remained at the front of the room, was the most 
vocal 
in responding to testimonies. 
Congregational singing and musical performances were 
interspersed with testifying, serving to set the tone and raise 
the mood of people to the level where they would feel they wanted 
to testify. 
Mr. Miller directed the congregational singing, and 
people in the audience asked for specific songs out of the 
hymnal. 
There were a couple of songs that were not in the hymnal 
that they projected onto a screen at the front of the room. 
The 
opening hymn and prayer were performed while the congregation 
stood, but for most of the rest of the service, people were 
seated. 
People were called on to stand and pray, and they did so 
in their places. 
At one point Mrs. Becker sang "Put Your Hand in the Hand," 
accompanying herself on a tenor guitar. 
She introduced the song 
with a short statement about how we should have our hands in the 
hand of the Lord. 
Her singing performance consisted of standing 
still, but moving her head back and forth in a sort of emphatic 
gesture with a smile on her face and making direct eye contact 
with the audience. 
Among the songs sung at the meeting were "Standing on the 
Promises," (#161 
in their hymnbook) and "What a Wonderful Savior" 
(#134), and "Sing! Make a Joyful Sound." 
After about an hour of singing and testifying, the reverend 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 57 
came forward to present communion. 
Mrs. Becker and Mr. Miller 
were trying to put up the projection screen while Rev. Becker 
spoke, and they were making quite a bit of noise, and the 
audience began to snicker a bit until the reverend asked what was 
going on--not sternly, more in a joking manner. 
Everyone 
laughed, then communion began. 
(This took place after the 
collection was taken, by the way, during which Mrs. Becker played 
something on the organ.) 
The reverend read a song out of the 
hymnbook, then pronounced a blessing out of his prayer book on 
the bread (crackers). 
Everyone held their piece of cracker and 
then took them together. 
The ritual was repeated with the grape 
juice. 
We were welcomed by the congregation, and they, after being 
kept in the dark for a while, were happy to cooperate with us 
once they knew what we were doing. 
It was nice to have Joseph 
along to shoot pictures--he had more nerve than I would have had 
in a church service, walking right up to people to take their 
picture as they prayed or testified or whatever. 
I think there 
are going to be some great pictures.

It's pandemonium in the office again as we increase in 
numbers. 
I did manage to 
log a tape this morning, though, 
in 
spite of the noise. 
Carl 
is sorting out the sound equipment, 
because we have gotten it mixed up through working with recording 
of church services. 
This afternoon Sue and I went to Camden to meet Ed Wanzer at 
his office in the county personnel department. 
(Sue accompanied 
me because I told her I am an urbophobe--the thought of driving 
into a large city for the first time petrified me. 
I'm glad she 
came, too, because the freeways were confusing.) 
Ed 
is a tall 
black man running for mayor of Chesilhurst and is a third— 
generation native of the borough. 
He 
is the Affirmative Action 
officer for Camden County. 
He characterizes G—Chesilhurst; 31GT as 
a rural bedroom community which has recently (1960s) changed to a 
primarily black community due to some kind of a massive land sale 
by the government. 
He said that at one time they say Al Capone lived there, and 
once the boxing champion Jack Johnson came speeding through town 
and was stopped by an officer and given a fine. 
He handed over 
double the amount and said, "Here's double, 
'cause I'll 
be doing 
the same thing on the way back." 
I asked about the prosperous appearance of Chesilhurst, with 
its stone AME Church and tennis courts, and he thought that was 
really off the track. 
He said the tennis courts were built, 
along with street paving and other improvements, by a series of 
federal block grants that the borough received--supposedly the 
largest amount of money awarded to one city in the country. 
He 
said that the majority of residents are small businessmen--
truckers, electrical and other types of contractors, real estate 
agents, and the like. 
He said that most of the people are 
"working stiffs." 
He also said that if you look closely, you 
will find that most of the houses were built by the owners, 
except for some "ranchburgers" that were built in one area with 
FHA low—interest money. 
Bobby Field is the police chief in the 
borough, and would know lots of people. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 59 
I asked about the place on Garfield with the fantastic yard 
art and the name "The Hills" on a sign outside, and he said that 
it 
is the home of a Dr. Hill 
(Ph.D., female). 
He also 
recommended Pleasant Harris, who lives at 3rd and Miller in a 
brick ranch house. 
She 
is an antique collector, makes her own 
medicines, and 
is quite prominent. 
I think she must be the "Mrs. 
H" of Berger's report, who has been listed 
in Who's Who and the 
like. 
There 
is also a Leona Harris, who 
is 
102 years old and was 
a founding member of the AME Church. 
Marion Peters of 4th and 
Hayes is a deacon of the AME Church. 
(I found it interesting how 
Ed identified the locations of all 
the people's homes as 
crossroads of city streets, always naming the number first.) 
The last mayor of Chesilhurst was 
a Muslim: 
Mansour Alwan. 
He was the mayor for nine years, and was the one responsible for 
the beginning of the federal funds that came into the borough. 
However, Ed feels that the fact that he was a Muslim ultimately 
led to his downfall as mayor. 
His reasoning for this conclusion 
was unclear. 
If a man 
is mayor for nine years before his 
religion becomes a factor in his election or defeat, 
it doesn't 
make sense. 
There is a Muslim community at Ancora called Eseldean 
Village. 
Chesilhurst had a CME Church, but it burned 
in the 
forest fire of 1970. 
There 
is also an Episcopal (he thinks) 
church on the White Horse Pike. 
I mentioned that we are interested in gender roles and 
division of labor, and he said that he does most of the cooking 
at his house. 
His wife works in social services at Atco. 
He 
felt that there are lots of couples who share roles because 
economic realities necessitate that both of them be employed. 
He told us that there are three cemeteries in the town. 
Bill Hengst also made a point of mentioning them, and I don't 
think either time we made an 
issue of seeing cemeteries. 
There 
is a German cemetery on Grant Avenue, a black one at 3rd and Elm, 
and the one connected to the Grant AME Church at Grant between 
6th and 7th. 
The former two are quite grown over, he said. 
Christine Wormley is a woman living at the BJ Guest Home who 
was the recording secretary of the AME Church. 
He wasn't sure, 
though, 
if she 
is still entirely mentally competent. 
I asked if there were any storytellers or good liars 
in the 
community, and he recalled that when he was a kid he was on a 
baseball team and they used to sit around and tell stories about 
the area and bull each other. 
He didn't think anything like that 
was still going on. 
Minerva Webster, at 5th and Grant, may have some stories of 
the history of Chesilhurst. 
Her husband founded the Democratic 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 60 
Party in town. 
Ed was very pleasant, about 35 years old, and was fairly 
skillful at expressing himself. 
His office was extremely drab 
and lacking in any decoration at all. 
He kept apologizing to Sue 
as he saw her looking around the office, saying, "It's pretty 
drab, 
isn't it." 
He also saw her looking at a flow chart on the 
wall 
(the only thing that was on the walls) and said, "Oh, you 
noticed that 'further' 
is misspelled. 
The girl who did the chart 
was from North Carolina, and 
it's the way it sounds to her." 
Actually, the printing was so small that I could barely read it, 
let alone Sue, who was farther from the chart than I was. 
He was 
something of a joker, and was easy to talk to.

In the morning I went down toward Buena in hopes of 
meeting the lady who advertised homemade tortellini and ravioli 
near Landisville. 
I had to stop 
in May's Landing to pick up a T— 
shirt order that Jens had placed, so after that I took Highway 40 
toward Buena, a road that I had not as yet travelled. 
I saw a 
beautifully laid—out farm market--Bucci's at G—Richland; 03GT and 
stopped to ask 
if I could take pictures. 
There 
is something 
about some of these markets that is 
irresistible to a 
photographer. 
The woman, Mrs. Bucci, was perfunctory in giving 
permission for me to shoot, and I decided I may not be able to 
get much information. 
However, 
in the course of my work, Mr. 
Bucci came over and struck up a conversation, beginning by saying 
that I probably wouldn't have my pictures come out that I was 
shooting in the shade of the stand. 
I said that I had the right 
kind of film, so they probably would. 
The stand sells flowers 
grown 
in their own greenhouse, produce grown on their own farm, 
and other plants and some produce that are imported. Mr. Bucci 
estimated that 85% of the produce they sell 
is home—grown. 
He 
also sells stuff from California. They also sell yard art and 
martin houses that are made 
in Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Bucci drives 
out to Pennsylvania once a year with a truck and fills it up with 
plaster figures, wood figures, and martin houses, and by the end 
of the season they are mostly sold. 
Mr. 
Bucci has turned most of the farming over to his son 
now, and 
is selling the farm to him. 
He said that a farmer 
always winds up with nothing--"a bunch of land and no money." 
I asked him if the farm and market are entirely family— 
operated. 
He said he hires Puerto Ricans to do a lot of the "man 
work." 
I asked about the plants they sell. 
They grow many flowers 
in their greenhouse, but also carry cactus and black roses 
(related to the cactus) from Arizona. 
The woman working at the 
market said that the most popular plants that people buy for 
their yards are impatiens, begonias, petunias, and marigolds. 
This time of year, mums are popular. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 62 
The market was run by a Canadian lady, who opened it 
in 
1939. 
Bucci's started running it 
in 1963 and bought it 
in 1967. 
The farm is 100% irrigated, and they have over 100 acres. 
He 
said he had a $3700 electric bill this summer from running the 
pumps. 
Among the crops they raise are romaine, lettuce, 
tomatoes, potatoes, parsley, escarole, endive, Chinese cabbage, 
spinach, and lots of others. 
Mr. Bucci told me that another 
well—run and beautiful market is 
run by Joe Batiglia (sp?) 
of 
the White Horse Market--they raise only peaches. 
Mr. Bucci gave 
his mailing address as John Bucci, RD 4, Llwellyn Avenue, 
Richland, NJ 08350. 
He said that he started in construction and made nothing, so 
decided to go 
into farming. 
He got a loan to start a farm--by 
the way, Italians had a hard time getting loans--and put up an 
old second—hand tractor for collateral. 
He made enough to pay 
the 
loan back and borrow more. 
He kept buying land to add to his 
holdings, but now says that he can't give the land or anything to 
his son--"You can't give anything away"--because his son's wife 
could up and leave, and she would be entitled to half of 
everything his son had, and the land would go out of the family. 
He has never planned to sell his land for development because he 
wants the area to remain agricultural. 
For that reason, he has 
not felt the intensity of anger at the Pinelands Commission for 
devaluing his 
land that other farmers have felt who intended to 
use the sale of some land for retirement income. 
Mr. Bucci said 
that he didn't want development because then they'd have kids 
putting sand 
in the gas tanks and 
it turns into a mess. 
I asked if his wife cans and freezes food from the farm, and 
he said yes, a lot, and his daughter—in—law just learned to put 
up tomatoes from his wife. 
I asked 
if he considered his home to be part of the 
pinelands, and he said no, although they are 
in the Pinelands 
Reserve. 
He said, "Those pineys lead a more solitude life. 
We 
mix with the public." 
He conceived of the pineys as 
living 
around Chatsworth. 
There was a woman, no relation to the Bucci family, who was 
sort of 
in charge of the sales 
in the market and was painting 
pumpkins for Halloween. 
She said they can't keep them in stock, 
especially those that have Smurfs and other cartoon characters on 
them. 
She said that Bucci's was the only market that had Smurfs 
on their pumpkins, and people would come from all over to get 
them. 
(The next day, however, I found Smurfs pumpkins at Emma's 
Market at G—Elwood; 12GT, which were painted by Sal Putiri, Jr.) 
The woman was being assisted by a teen—aged girl, I think John's 
niece. 
They were painting pumpkins, getting ready for the 
weekend. 
They will 
take special painting orders 
is they can. 
Bucci's is certainly one of the most beautiful of the farm 
Thatcher-- 83 
Fieldnotes 
page 63 
markets in terms of arrangement of produce--it is very artistic. 
They have a large sign depicting a farmer in a straw hat and with 
a white beard and blue overalls that Mr. Bucci said he was 
thinking about having put onto a postcard for neet year. 
It 
seems to me he would do better by having a picture of the market 
itself put on the card, but he 
is probably thinking of 
advertising, and, of course, the sign 
is a direct form of 
advertising. 
He showed me an article that was in 
last week's 
paper--I think the Atlantic County Record, that had a picture of 
the market and a story about it and other markets. 
An interesting part of the visit was when Mr. Bucci pointed 
out his son operating a large red closed—in tractor--probably 
air—conditioned--behind the stand. 
He said that he paid $29,000 
for the tractor, and that if anyone had told him when he started 
with a $1500 loan, that he would someday spend $29,000 on a 
tractor, he would have thought they were crazy. 
TX02: After leaving Bucci's, I travelled on to G—Landisville; 02GT 
and stopped at the house on Highway 40 that advertises the 
homemade tortellini and ravioli. 
There was a piece of plastic 
stretched over the word "tortellini," so I supposed correctly, as 
it turned out, that only ravioli was available that day. 
I 
knocked on the door, and the lady opened it a crack and answered 
my questions about the pasta, then told me to come around to the 
back. 
I did, and went into the tiny kitchen where there was a 
little withered man 
in a wheel chair and a nicely dressed woman 
with a gray beehive hairdo and a purse--a visitor. 
The woman who 
had answered the door was Mrs. Ricci, the one who makes the 
pasta,, and she was dressed 
in a housedress and curlers. 
The 
man, 
it turned out, was her husband who has been crippled with 
rheumatoid arthritis for 26 years and also has what they termed 
"bad nerves." 
He apparently has breakdowns of some sort or 
other. 
He was fine to talk to that day, and spoke of being 
crippled and unable to farm as he used to do. 
I asked Mrs. Ricci 
if she has a garden, and she said that I should talk to her 
husband because she always asks his advice on everything relating 
to gardening. 
(foodways) 
She makes pasta to supplement their meager social security 
income, and she spends her days cooking, taking care of the house 
and garden, and bathing, dressing, and caring for her husband. 
The theme of most of their conversation was the hardships they 
have to bear. 
The other woman was fairly quiet, and was a second 
cousin who had come to visit and to help where she could. 
Mrs. Ricci seldom makes tortellini 
lately because it 
is 
so 
hard to do--too much work for the $3.75 she gets for it. She 
twists it all 
by hand. 
The ravioli 
is $3.00 for a bag of 50, and 
she sells them frozen. 
She warned me against letting them thaw 
out because they would just be a big glob of dough. 
She had two 
varieties, and I bought the one that had spinach with the meat. 
Mrs. Ricci's phone number is (609) 697-1511. 
I told her that I 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 64 
might like to come back and talk to her about her work as a woman 
and to look at their yard. 
She is extremely busy, but was, I 
think, flattered at my 
interest. 
TX03: I moved on to my appointment with Carl Liepe at Cologne. 
He 
is a former nurseryman who sold his Atlantic Nursery a few 
years ago and now does a little nursery work, but is mostly 
retired. 
His land was originally a farm purchased by his father, 
and his father changed it into the nursery 
in 
1921 when Carl was 
10 years old. 
I set up the Nagra in the living room where we had a taping 
session 
before he took me on a walk through the woods behind his 
house. 
One of the mikes was dead--later diagnosed as a dead 
battery and a dead spare battery--so I recorded in mono. 
Mr. 
Liepe was not comfortable with the mikes, however, and kept 
ducking out from under them. 
I tried to adjust them so they 
wouldn't bother him so much, but we'll see how the tape turns 
out. 
I asked him about native plants in 
landscaping, and he 
essentially said that professional 
landscapers don't use them as 
much as homeowners themselves. 
He said that several years ago he 
tried raising native stock and selling it at the nursery, but the 
response was, 
I can go out in the woods and get that for 
myself--why should I pay you an outrageous price for it?" 
I asked how landscaping has changed over the years, and he 
said that the old timers didn't go 
in for foundation planting 
(plants close to the foundations of the house) the way people do 
now. 
In addition, farmers didn't and don't have enough time for 
gardening, so the landscaping consisted of whatever "the lady of 
the house wanted." 
They didn't have a landscape plan--they just 
did what they liked. 
Money and time available to homeowners have 
also made a difference in how much effort is put into 
landscaping. 
Mr. Liepe said that he collects grape vine and other natural 
materials (acorns, pine cones, nuts, weeds) and makes Christmas 
ornaments. 
He later showed me his work bench where he does the 
work, and he has a very neat and tidy work area. 
He does it all 
with a hot glue gun, and some of the gluing is fairly messy and 
shows on the front of the ornaments. 
He gave me a cross made of 
split Black Pine cones and a hemlock cone in the center. 
He also 
prepares grave blankets and materials for grave blankets, using 
sea lavender (status), German status, mullen, Scotch broom, 
teasels, and velvet leaf (a weed found 
in cornfields). 
Mr. Liepe's address is Carl H. Liepe, Cologne Avenue, R. D. 
#3, Box 260, Mays Landing, NJ 
08330. 
After we talked in the house, we began to prepare to take a 
walk through the woods at the back of his six acres. 
He has 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 65 
created a little nature trail there with signs on the trees and 
plants indicating their names, both proper and common. 
His wife 
invited me to stay to dinner, and I accepted. 
We walked through the woods, and I attempted to tape Carl 
with the $300 cassette tape recorder--much easier on the shoulder 
than the Nagra. 
I think the results will be mixed--I haven't 
heard the tape yet. 
I used the wand mike, and it had some hand 
noise in spite of all my efforts to avoid it. 
I also found I 
could not take as many pictures as I would have liked because of 
having to handle the mike and the tape recorder in addition to 
the cameras. 
Mr. Liepe dresses and takes care of the woods as 
if they 
were a well—trimmed lawn. 
He carefully clears away leaves and 
brush that may obscure a small plant, and he clears trails 
through the area so that he and his family can walk or ride a 
motorcycle through them. 
His woods are a little unusual because 
of the planting of crippled plants from the nursery that he could 
not bear to throw away. 
There are things like large rhododendron 
bushes and white pines growing in some parts of the woods that 
are not normally found in that habitat. 
He worries about how to 
dispose of a dead tree so that it will not fall on the 
rhododendrons or otherwise smash something down. 
He has placed 
little stakes with flags on them to mark the locations of 
lady's 
slippers and to keep people from stepping on them. 
We walked through the woods and his garden, where he grows 
not only the usual vegetables, but also flowers for beauty and 
sunflowers to provide seeds for feeding birds 
in the winter. 
The 
garden, too, was well—tended. 
We went into the house at 5:30 and had a delicious supper of 
meat loaf with peppers on the top, boiled potatoes with 
margarine, string beans, quartered plum tomatoes, cucumbers in 
vinegar, and a last—minute helping of candied sweet potatoes. 
Although Mrs. Liepe (Dot) does not care for sweet potatoes 
herself, Carl 
loves them, and so she keeps a bowl 
of cooked ones 
in the refrigerator all 
the time, and she can candy them in about 
five minutes, which she did for me after we had sat down to 
dinner. 
They did not serve anything to drink with the meal, but 
as we got almost to dessert, she asked us whether we wanted hot 
tea or cold tea, and I said, " Could I just have water?" 
And she 
said, "Really?" 
Then she served Jewish apple cake for dessert. 
It was delicious. 
Her brother from Ohio, Paul, was there with us 
also. He comes and helps out occasionally. 
Carl has emphysema 
from an allergy to an anesthetic he received in the hospital--he 
never was a smoker. 
(foodways) 
After dinner, Carl, Paul, Carl's granddaughter, Paul's dog, 
and I went on a jaunt in Carl's three—wheel motorcycle—truck 
along sand roads through fields of 
lettuce, alfalfa, sweet 
potatoes, and peach trees. 
All of the land belongs to the Liepe 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 66 
family--mostly his cousins, the Liepe brothers who are big 
produce growers. 
All told, the family has about 400 acres of 
land. 
We went through forest, too--one stand of white pines 
planted years ago by one of his cousins is so dense that a person 
would be hard put to walk through it. 
The little moto—truck was 
ideal for getting through the sand roads, some of them deep 
in 
loose sand. 
Carl said that he drives through the land like this 
often, and he never drives on land that does not belong to 
family. 
He referred to his cousin's sweet potato field that we 
passed and said that after the pickers are through, he can go 
in 
and glean all 
the potatoes they left behind. 
There was someone 
gleaning in the twilight as we drove back toward the house. 
Carl has a museum in his basement of family artifacts--
bottles, old toys, containers, tools,--all kinds of stuff that he 
used to display at the nursery when he had it. 
He said people 
used to enjoy looking at the stuff. 
Now it 
is very neatly 
arranged in the cellar of his house (the house looks like 
it 
couldn't be more than 20 years old). 
They were very friendly and helpful, and their attitude is a 
preservationist one toward the woods. 
They have a naturalist's 
appreciation of the area, without perhaps some of the concerns of 
a person who makes a living exploiting the pines in one way or 
another. 
He 
is a gardener.

I drove to G—Atco; 32GT to meet Leah Wilhelm, the tax 
collector for Waterford Twp. and a long—time resident of the 
township. 
Her family has been 
in the area for many years, and 
her brother is Joe Maressa, a former state senator. 
I hoped to 
make some contacts through her that would introduce us 
into the 
township, and I was not disappointed. 
As soon as I sat down, she began to talk about Pinelands 
Commission and told me that it has been very hard on the old 
people who planned to use land sales for their retirement income. 
In fact, she said there have been four suicides because of that. 
"Pinelands is removed--they don't see that, but we do." 
In 
addition, she said that the tax base has been shattered by the 
rezoning that Pinelands has done, so the tax rate has had to go 
up. 
She said she believes in preservation of the core area, and 
of course there should be a buffer zone around the pines, but 
they have made the buffer zone too big--Atco should not be part 
of 
it. 
"They took too big a chunk." 
Most of the local economic contributors are mom and pop 
style businesses and farmers. 
There are Italians, Germans and 
Polish people here, and they all share the idea of passing land 
on to their kids and keeping it in the family, and with the 
building restrictions of Pinelands, they are having trouble doing 
that. 
(I might add that when Sue and I visited with Clara 
Paolino at Spaghetti Night in Hammonton last week, she said that 
her son had some land to build a house on, but he didn't have 
enough, so she and her husband had to give him three acres so 
they could build a house. 
It 
is 
located next to Clara's house. 
We will see her this coming week, and will get a better concept 
of what is going on there.) 
Leah went on to say that Joseph Wharton bought land in 
Waterford Twp. from the Richards family that owned it (Jackson 
Glass Works was started by the Scotch—Irish Thomas Richards, who 
was of the Batsto iron family, according to Leah) so that he 
could ship fresh pinelands water to Philadelphia and New York. 
Now, Leah said, Pinelands Commission is doing the same thing--
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 68 
protecting the resources of the p 
i 
ne l 
ands for the benef i 
t of the 
cities, not the locals. 
History. 
Swedes and Italians came to work in the glass works. 
Italians settled in G—Waterford; 32GT, and Swedes settled in 
G—Swedesboro; 32GT, but the latter left when the iron and glass 
works began to run out. 
Irish, English, Scottish and Germans 
remained in the area, and the township is divided. 
Waterford is 
still basically Italian while Atco is northern European. 
In 
addition there are Ukrainians (contact: 
Paul Lisnyj [pronounced 
Lisney], 767-6797--former mayor, speaks Ukrainian) who have a 
church off Stratford in G—Atco; 32GT. 
This group does not stay 
together geographically too much. 
There 
is also a Jewish 
community (contact: 
Judy Swimmer, 767-2504--mention Leah's 
name). 
Ethnic feeling is strong in Waterford Twp., especially 
between Italians, Germans and English (this last surprised me, 
but it later became apparent that she meant that northern 
Europeans stick together and Italians stick together). 
There is 
a group called the Lion Tamers Association in G—Atco; 32GT that is 
basically a social club for northern Europeans. 
Leah, of Italian 
ancestry (her name is from her husband, who was from Indiana), 
says she would never be able to get into the Lion Tamers. 
Then 
in G—Waterford; 32GT there is the San Sostine Society, which 
is 
Catholic and Italian. 
They have an annual carnival 
in July--
apparently similar to Our Lady of Mount Carmel Day 
in Hammonton. 
The Sons of Italy are also active in the area of Waterford. 
Leah, who 
is active 
in politics, says that every ticket has to be 
balanced between the two groups--only so many candidates can have 
names ending in an "a." 
This is 
in contrast to the signs Carl 
and I saw in Buena Vista Twp. where almost all the campaign signs 
we saw touted running mates whose names were all 
Italian. 
Leah 
says that the two groups are melding somewhat in the Assumption 
Church. 
As the younger generations grow up, there is 
less 
consideration of ethnic background. 
However, she went on to 
point out that there are other clubs that illustrate the 
division--the Contemporary Club is a women's club 
in Atco, and 
the Reader's Club is a women's club 
in Waterford, and they are 
divided along ethnic lines. 
However, after all 
this, when I used the word "prejudice" 
in 
my questions, Leah felt it was too strong. 
She said, "It's not 
like that. 
We live together and we work together, and we balance 
the political tickets, but we accept it. 
I wouldn't apply to be 
in the Lion Tamers. 
We accept it." 
We returned to the question of 
local festivals, and she 
elaborated further on San Sostine Day. 
It 
is held around July 28 
or 29, and they have a parade and a religious festival and 
fireworks. 
Attendance is dying, however. 
Other festivals include the Halloween Parade, held usually 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 69 
on the Saturday nearest Halloween. 
This includes a costume 
contest judged by a local official. 
They have a July Fourth 
celebration with a parade and a barbeque at Legion Hall. 
This 
also includes a Miss ICCA (Intercommunity Culture Association). 
I was a little unclear on this, but Leah said something about 
ICCA starting to take over some of the July 4th celebration and 
this 
is 
leading to the gradual fading of community celebrations. 
The Waterford Church has a ravioli dinner and a Mass in October. 
Leah promised to let me know when this 
is and arrange for us to 
come and document it. 
Leah talked briefly about the fire companies and their 
dinners. 
She said they have one woman firefighter, Edna Day. 
"We're very proud of her. 
She's a local girl." 
They also have 
bingo through the fire companies. 
She talked about the teams that came in to study the area 
prior to the adoption of the Pinelands plan, and said that they 
found that people here have a great love and respect for the 
ground. 
She said that when people are talking about investing 
money, someone will usually say, "Buy ground--they're not making 
any more of it." 
She tied this statement in with how she and her 
family, 
like other families in the area, used to pick their own 
crops. 
They did not hire anyone to come and work--especially 
migrants. 
She said that family pickers had a respect for the 
vines and the ground as they picked and didn't tear things up. 
But her family is no 
longer in farming--the work is too hard. 
She said that's why all 
the kids around here got educated, be 
cause they didn't want to have to work that hard anymore, so they 
were motivated to get an education. 
TX02: After leaving Atco, I headed toward Hammonton with the 
intention of visiting with the Putiris and seeing when I could 
get an introduction to the black rabbi who lives near them. 
I 
was traveling south on 206 near G—Hammonton; 11GT and saw some men 
working in a field, so I stopped to see what they were doing and 
to take some pictures. 
The owner happened to be there--Anthony 
DiMeo, 366 Middle Road, Hammonton, and partner in Columbia Fruit 
Farms. 
He and his laborers (Puerto Ricans) were working in a 
strawberry field, preparing it for winter. 
They were hoeing 
around the plants and getting ready to put down a straw mulch. 
Mr. DiMeo said that he and his brothers farm about 1100 acres and 
raise all kinds of produce, marketed mostly in New York. 
They 
have a fruit market stand--Columbia Fruit Farms--on 206, but it 
is not in use, or at least it wasn't when I drove by after 
talking with him. 
I asked if I could take pictures, and he said 
yes, but he wouldn't let me get close to the workers, so all 
the 
shots are long ones. 
He talked about the great expense of being 
in farming--especially in 
land taxes. 
He was making the rounds 
of his fields, working for a short time 
in this one. 
Every car 
or truck that went by, he waved at the driver, calling out their 
names. 
A couple of trucks went by carrying dark earth, and I 
asked what it was. 
It 
is bog soil that is allowed to dry out, 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 70 
then later used as mulch. 
TX03: 
As I left him and turned left onto the White Horse Pike, I 
noticed Middle Road, so turned onto 
it. G—Hammonton; 11GT. 
It 
is 
the location of 
large beautiful homes, both old and new, and a 
couple of fruit packing houses. 
I was impressed with the 
landscapes around these houses, so stopped to photograph one 
in 
particular (no one was home to give permission) that was around a 
modern house. 
Then I moved on to an older house with nicely— 
trimmed bushes and found two men washing out wine casks. 
They 
are brothers—in—law, Nello Benedetti (the owner of the house) and 
Mr. Sabatini. 
Mr. Benedetti 
is an immigrant from Italy (I 
believe he said Bologna) who came over about 30 years ago. 
He 
is 
a good gardener and grows all kinds of Italian vegetables like 
gardone, something in the artichoke family that has large frondy 
leaves which he ties up and wraps with newspaper to bleach the 
stalks like celery. 
He uses it for family and friends--he must 
have a large family and group of friends, because there was a lot 
of gardone there. 
He said that they use 
it for soup, omelettes, 
and fried. 
He has a large fig tree 
in his yard--a beautiful 
one--that he covers every winter with tar paper and insulation. 
He also grows endive, zucchini, tomatoes, and a number of 
other vegetables, as well 
as a cherry tree. 
He owns the house 
next to his, too, and lived 
in 
it for many years. 
Now his son 
lives 
in part of 
it and the other part is rented out. 
He 
is a 
stonemason by trade, and has traveled all over south Jersey doing 
stone work. 
He did all 
the brick work on his present house--it 
has been radically remodelled by him--and built some stone 
planters in front of the other house. 
His address is 194 Middle 
Road, Hammonton, 08037, phone: 
561-8252. 
Mr. Sabatini's number 
is 561-2858. 
(Mr. Benedetti has a thick accent. 
His wife and 
brother—in—law have more of an American accent and are easier to 
understand.) 
I took pictures of the yard and garden, although not 
extensive ones. 
Every area is neatly defined with borders of 
brick, stone, or plant material. 
In the middle of the drive was 
an 
island with grass, a tree, shrubs and flowers. 
Within that 
area was a little saint statue surrounded by plastic flowers 
which Mr. Benedetti apologized a little bit for. 
He said the 
saint came from the cemetery where a relative was buried, and 
they had to remove it for some reason. 
He showed me the wine barrels in his garage containing a 
mixture of California grape varieties. 
He uses 600 pounds of 
grapes to make 50 gallons of wine. 
He 
likes California grapes 
because they are sweeter, and he does not have to add sugar as he 
would for local grapes. 
Since there are no additives in his 
wine, 
it 
is very pure. 
He said, "Wine this way never hurt 
nobody." 
It will be a heavy wine with higher alcohol 
percentage--"more like south Italy wine," because he 
likes 
it 
that way, although he 
is from north Italy. 
He said an Italian 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 71 
"can't eat, got no wine at the table." 
He said that he would be drawing the wine off on Monday, and 
I got permission for us to return to photograph it, but the way 
things turned out, he had a brother in Italy die, and they 
started drawing off wine early, and we could not make connections 
for the photography session. 
It might be worth mapping the yard 
on another occasion. 
It was beautifully trimmed and cared for. 
TX04: I dropped 
in on the Putiris next to see 
if I could get an 
introduction into the black Jewish community that lives near 
them. 
Sal, Senior came with me after I photographed some painted 
pumpkins that Sal, Jr. had done (he also paints their signs), and 
we went on a tour of the area. 
First we visited Rabbi Abel 
Respes on Moss Mill Road in G—Elwood; 12GT, and I set up an 
appointment for next Thursday. 
The rabbi's house 
is a modest one 
that 
is 
immaculately kept up and beautifully landscaped. 
In 
fact, when we arrived at his place, his daughter, dressed up 
in a 
business suit, directed us to the yard where he was working. 
He 
was dressed in a sweatshirt and light—colored work pants and 
wearing a cat—cap over his longish graying hair. 
He seemed a 
little reticent at first, but was pleasant when I explained our 
interests. 
After visiting with the rabbi, Sal 
took me across the street 
and showed me a small group of old hidden graves in the woods 
across from the rabbi's house. 
He didn't know who the people 
were that were buried there--whether they were from Amatol or 
some other settlement. 
(Amato) would actually be too late for 
the dates on the stones.) 
Sal 
and his boys are very interested 
in cemeteries--they have mentioned these graves, some graves in 
the Batsto—Pleasant Mills cemetery, and another old cemetery 
called St. Mary's on Pleasant Mills Road. 
In fact, this last one 
was our next stop on the tour. 
However, we passed a modern 
(relatively speaking--it looked like it was probably established 
in the 1800s but is still being used) cemetery which I pointed 
out, and Sal said, "Oh, yeah, I don't know what that one is." 
His interest in cemeteries, then seems to be linked to a concern 
for the past life of his home area. 
History. In fact, he still 
tends to emphasize the past with us even though we have made 
it 
abundantly clear that we are interested in present—day life. 
I 
think maybe he feels that we can't understand the present if we 
don't understand the past. 
We stopped at St. Mary's cemetery, which is all overgrown 
and hardly visible from the road, but is marked by a historical 
marker memorializing the church that used to be there. 
Sal 
pointed out that a Mr. Froehlinger(sp?) of salt water taffy fame 
is buried there. 
He mentioned this several times. 
Apparently 
the man invented a very good salt water taffy. 
Sal 
is a member 
of the Knights of Columbus and they have been attempting to 
determine ownership of the cemetery and get permission to clean 
it up. 
They have wanted to find out what diocese, I think, has 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 72 
jurisdiction over the graveyard before taking steps to restore 
i 
t. 
TX05: We went on our way, and Sal told me we would go to the old 
mill playhouse, which he had mentioned before and I had not 
understood what it was. 
It 
is 
on Pleasant Mills Road about a 
quarter of a mile from where it joins Rt. 542 G—Pleasant Mills; 
12GT. 
It was an old cotton mill, then a paper mill, then in this 
century it was turned into a playhouse where several well—known 
actors started their careers in the mid-1950s. 
The woman who 
funded the playhouse project, Ada Fenno, died 
in 1975 and 
specified in her will that the mill be maintained as a cultural 
center by whoever purchased it. 
Paul Lightman purchased it and 
now lives 
in the mill, "restoring"--really remodelling--it. 
He 
has established The Pleasant Mills Foundation, Inc., which many 
people consider merely a tip of the hat to the will's 
requirement. 
He says he holds classes and studios 
in the 
building, and a ballerina comes and practices on one of the upper 
floors. 
However, he does not allow the public to enter the 
building and shuns all publicity that might adversely affect his 
plans. 
We drove up and honked the horn to 
let him know we were 
there, and he was somewhat hostile until Sal 
introduced himself. 
Sal's connections as former mayor probably get him into a lot of 
places. 
Mr. Lightman is from Trenton and gave us a tour of the 
building, showing us the old playhouse stage, which he says will 
not be used. 
It is a dream house that would likely be featured 
in something like House and Garden, and 
it 
is his personal 
kingdom. 
He says he plans to have an art show--by invitation 
only to proven and serious collectors--of Pinelands art. 
He has 
started a photography club, an art club, and a garden club, 
saying he doesn't charge, but people must prove that they are 
serious. 
He doesn't charge so that he can throw them out if he 
wants to. 
One of the gardens he 
is planning is going to be a fern 
garden, which led me to ask 
if 
he 
is trying to use only native 
plants in the gardens. 
He said yes, but friends keep giving him 
gifts of plants and he can't throw them out; besides, sea 
captains used to bring 
in plants, and how long does a plant have 
to 
live here before it's considered indigenous? 
He also is 
planning a wild bird sanctuary in a part of the mill that is 
inaccessible to predators because of the high walls. 
I asked Lightman what his line of work was before he 
retired, and he said that he used to lecture at Cornell on "how 
to take people's money away from them." 
He was editor of SM 
Magazine (SM stood for Successful Meetings). 
He didn't say more 
than that. 
He 
is a controversial character in Pleasant Mills, and one 
woman is apparently trying to get him out of the mill. 
He 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 73 
complained to us about the man who lives across the street in 
"Kate Aylesford's house"--Kate Aylesford (sp?) was the heroine of 
a novel modelled after a woman named Honoraria Reed in Pleasant 
Mills. 
Lightman says that the man doesn't keep the house up as 
he should. 
(The yard of that house looks pretty much like most 
of the yards in the area--mowed, but not raked of 
leaves or 
planted with fancy flower gardens.) 
Lightman is a talented 
gardener and has planted banks of flowers outside the mill--it is 
indeed a stunning sight, 
inside and out. 
Sal mentioned that he had been giving me the grand tour, and 
said that we had stopped at St. Mary's cemetery, whereupon 
Lightman informed us that he and his garden club were going to 
clean the graveyard up on November 5. 
This surprised Sal, who 
said that the Knights of Columbus had been pursuing the project. 
Lightman said that progress was too slow, and so he had talked to 
someone (I think a township official) and made arrangements to 
clean the place up. 
He brushed off Sal's suggestion that he 
contact the Knights because they were interested, too. 
Here was 
a conflict in values illustrated. 
The Knights of Columbus were 
operating through channels of authority that they recognized--the 
church was 
in charge of graveyards, and they were working through 
the church. 
Lightman had gone to secular authorities and 
bypassed the accepted processes. 
Sal didn't say anything to me 
about what he thought of the whole thing. 
He may have felt that 
the rights of 
locals were being usurped and he may not. 
I think 
Sal 
is a man who rolls with the punches and manages to make the 
best of whatever situation he 
is handed. 
Maybe I will be able to 
get him to comment on this issue when I see him again. 
After returning Sal 
to the fruit market, I started toward 
home and noted on Rt. 563 that the Weekstown Volunteer Fire Dept. 
was advertising a Spaghetti Dinner for October 22. 
TX06: I crossed the bridge over the Mullica on Rt. 563 124GT and 
noticed two men and a couple of boys fishing, so I stopped to 
visit with them. 
They were Ed Ayres, Box 140, New Gretna, NJ, 
08224, his friend Stan (didn't get the last name) and Ed's 
grandson. 
Stan and Ed both work for the highway department, and 
Stan was tending the bridge today. 
It 
is a drawbridge, and he 
said that it doesn't have to go up very often except for 
recreational boats: 
fishermen and people going to Sweetwater 
Casino for dinner. 
Ed knew he was there, so after work her 
brought some beer and joined Stan for some fishing. 
Ed 
is from 
New York, but has been 
in New Gretna for 25 years. 
He sees the 
pines as the last frontier, where people can come and make a life 
for themselves. 
He said that with the old timers around here, 
if 
somebody asks for help, you get up and help them. 
But with the 
new people, it's always "got a dollar?" 
The two men (Stan was 
probably half Ed's age--they made a point of that, saying that 
here you could be friends anyway, because they like each other) 
were helping Ed's grandson fish, and they caught them and threw 
them back. 
They didn't want to eat the fish.

This morning I had to go into town and do some laundry and 
buy some groceries after Nora kindly loaned me some cash until I 
can arrange a way to get cash from my bank 
in Utah. 
In the 
afternoon Gene Hunn and I went to visit Leo and Hazel Landy of 
Nature's Florist Supplies in G—Nesco; 12GT. 
Mary has done work 
with them before, and they are fond of her. 
We had a little 
trouble finding the place, but finally made it, and when we 
walked up, Leo said, 
"I thought you were coming yesterday. 
I 
guess I just didn't listen." 
There were a lot of kids around, 
and his daughter—in—law was there with a pet ferret she had just 
acquired. 
I wasn't sure what the kids were doing except hanging 
around. 
Two young men were building a cage for the ferret, a 
task which produced a lot of hammering and other noise in the 
background of our tape. 
Leo began talking to us immediately 
about his work and how he collects and uses plants. 
I started 
back to the car to get the cameras and cassette tape recorder, 
and ran 
into Hazel, who started talking right away about the 
business, her family, and other things. 
She was a lovely white— 
haired and coifed lady with a crisp blouse on, while Leo wore a 
limp shirt open to the waist and a cat cap. 
Hazel spoke of 
keeping the business running in spite of family problems such as 
Leo's alcoholism, which he now has under control. 
He hasn't had 
a drink 
in five years. 
We stood in the yard chatting for quite a 
while, and I was looking for an opening to go and get the tape 
equipment, but found it difficult to break in. 
Finally I did, 
and we were able to talk about a variety of things. 
Hazel 
is a 
woman I would like to visit again and talk about female roles and 
yardscapes. 
When I heard about the Landys, I had a visual 
image of an 
unpainted 18th century I—house surrounded by trees and sheds, 
with Leo being the gruff woodsman and Hazel the earthy unkempt 
partner. 
They proved to be more conventional than that, and 
their house was painted white, built probably in the early part 
of this century. 
There were indeed unpainted sheds, but there 
were other signs of order such as a garden and cultivated flowers 
(impatiens) in boxes around the sheds and house. 
Directly behind 
the house was a yard with a big tree with a dog house under it 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 76 
and a chain for a dog, but no dog. 
Behind that was the shed 
where they store and work with the plants they sell. 
Here they 
also make and store baskets out of grape vines and other types of 
woods. 
Behind that shed 
is Leo's pine cone popping shed, 
in 
which there are shelves with flat boxes of pine cones and a low 
stove made of an oil 
drum. 
He had the fire going this day, and 
he opened the door to let us smell the cones and feel the intense 
heat. 
The smell of the cones seems to be a source of some 
pleasure to the Landys, especially Hazel, just as appreciation of 
the beauties of tiny flowers and stalks of grass are also 
important. 
They have learned to notice things that other people 
pass by without a thought. 
Next to the popping shed are other 
sheds and the garden is behind them. 
Then there is an expanse of 
yard, mostly dirt, to the east, (the house faces north), then the 
long plastic—covered drying shed shaped like a quonset hut. 
I 
plan to go back and map the yard more exactly. 
In the plastic 
shed are various plants hung to dry and pine cones spread out to 
pop 
in the heat of the sun. 
Most of my conversation with Helen 
is 
on the cassette tape (PFP83—AET002), so I won't go 
into detail 
here. 
Before I could get the tape equipment, Hazel talked about 
how they got started in business. 
Leo's father died when he was 
ten. 
Both Leo and Hazel were working in Hammonton, and they were 
married. Leo was working for a man named Bill who had a florists' 
supply business, and Leo liked the work. 
Leo went to war in the 
forties and was captured by the Germans who put him in a prison 
camp. When he got out, he decided he wanted to do the same kind 
of work that Bill had been doing. 
Bill, 
in the meantime had 
changed his career to the production of sauerkraut, so he gave 
his customer list to the Landys. 
It had 4000 names on 
it, 
and 
they had catalogs printed up and sent them out. 
Only forty 
customers responded. 
After a couple of years they were able to 
weed out those who did not buy, and they had a solid small group 
of steady customers. 
Hazel commented on the plastic shed on their property and 
called it a "wigwam." 
She remembers the day that Leo's 
conscription notice came--she had just put a quilt up, and she 
remembers the details of the day perfectly. 
It 
is the same 
phenomenon that occurred on the day of John F. Kennedy's 
assassination: 
everyone knows exactly what they were doing when 
they heard the news. 
In this case, the news of Leo's 
conscription into the army must have been equally upsetting in 
her life, and she remembers the details. 
She didn't talk about 
the time during which he was a prisoner. 
It might be interesting 
to pursue. 
She spoke of all the people who have come to Leo asking him 
to start them in the same business--show them the ropes and the 
good places, etc. 
When they find out that it's hard work, they 
drop out of 
it. 
She said that he recently started some people 
from Maine--"I don't know how they're going to make it." 
She 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 77 
felt that they were pretty naive about the business, and very 
inexperienced. 
One time their barn burned. 
She said it was filled with 
hampers of dock and the ceiling was covered with Jersey statice: 
"It looked like Hawaii." 
They decided that the fire was started 
by a "kid on dope." 
At that time, 
in 
1974, there had been 
several similar fires and 
in one case a local youth had been seen 
going to and from the site of the fire just before it broke out. 
I asked Leo at that point if he had ever been a volunteer 
fireman, and he responded that he had "put me years in as a 
fireman." 
In the main work shed, they have a stove made of a 50 gallon 
drum. 
Leo built it, having bought the parts from a Sotz (sp?) 
company in Ohio. 
I noticed some interesting things during our visit. 
Leo 
referred to plants as "he." 
He was demonstrating the making of a 
grapevine basket and explaining how the grapevines vary 
in 
flexibility. 
He picked one up, saying that it would break if he 
tried to use it. 
It wasn't breaking, and he said, "He's going to 
make a liar out of me. 
But he'll break any minute now." 
Leo did 
the same thing later when talking about other plants. 
He also 
has a deep respect for nature, 
leaving red wing black birds' 
nests when cutting cattails--"We don't need the cattails that 
bad." 
He spoke of his feeling that Pinelands Commission isn't 
doing enough to protect the environment. 
His collecting areas 
are being affected by new housing coming in. 
He said that he 
made contact with other woodsmen (his term) through meeting them 
in bars. 
I don't know whether his being on the wagon for five 
years has had any detrimental effects--he is well enough 
established that he probably doesn't need to make any more 
contacts. 
The Landys take great pride 
in their work and 
in the quality 
of their products. 
Their comments about other people who 
couldn't cut it 
in the same business are evidence of this. 
They 
were happy to talk to us, and were very cordial once we got the 
initial misunderstanding about which day the appointment was 
cleared up. 
In fact, 
it really wasn't much of a hindrance. 
Leo 
simply chalked it up to his not listening when I called. 
I don't 
know what it was. 
Hazel, as we took our leave, told us that she 
was glad we had come as a distraction because she was so upset 
that day about her alcoholic son not showing up to help his 
father. 
While we were standing by the car before we 
left, one of 
her granddaughters came by saying something about going to the 
grocery store with Hazel's daughter—in—law. 
Hazel got extremely 
upset and told the girl that she didn't want her going to the 
store with the other woman to buy beer, which is what they had 
done. 
Gene was somewhat embarrassed and withdrew a little and 
looked at the front of the house. 
I stayed with Hazel, and she 
turned to me afterward and expressed her anger at drinking and 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 78 
having beer on the premises. 
She 
is very angry at her daughter— 
in—law for drinking around her husband (Hazel's son) and not 
helping him to overcome his alcoholism. 
Hazel fairly spit her 
words out as she spoke. 
I really felt sorry for her--she had 
told me how she had nearly thrown in the towel at one point when 
she felt she could no longer handle Leo's drinking. 
The best 
years of her life have been since he dried out. 
I definitely 
want to make a return visit.

Today I worked on notes 
in the morning and went to church 
as usual at Ft. Dix. 
I only stayed for Sacrament meeting as I 
had to get back to the house 
in time to head south for a 
Methodist Hymn Sing 
in Dorchester. 
While I was at church, the 
Bishop's wife, Mrs. Zimmerman, approached me and asked how our 
work is going and invited me to dinner after church. 
I was sorry 
to decline because of the taping session in Dorchester. 
Sue and I made a first stop at Emma's Fruit Market G—Elwood; 
12GT to see if we could catch some Sunday travelers buying 
pumpkins for Halloween. 
The traffic at the stand was light, so 
there wasn't as much to take pictures of as we had hoped, but it 
turned out that Sal, Jr. was painting pumpkins in the house 
behind the stand. 
We went in and watched him as he painted Fred 
Flintstone onto a pumpkin. 
He said that their market has an edge 
because he paints all the popular cartoon characters: 
Miss 
Piggy, Popeye, Fred Flintstone, E.T., Spiderman and others. 
He 
said that one year when the Phillies won the World Series 
pennant, his most popular pumpkins were painted with the Philly 
Fanatic. 
Sal 
also paints the big road signs for the fruit 
market. 
We asked him questions about how he got to be so good at 
copying cartoons (he does have a pretty good eye), and he said, 
"Anybody can put a face on a pumpkin." 
TX02: Sue and I had made previous plans to meet Carl at the 
Dorchester United Methodist Church G—Dorchester; 38GT one hour 
before the seven o'clock service. 
Unfortunately, our 
instructions led us to believe that the church was 
in Port 
Elizabeth, so we spent some time we didn't have being lost. 
We 
also realized that we were low on gas and would not have enough 
to get home after the service. 
When we found the place 
in 
Dorchester, we were about fifteen minutes late and Carl was 
waiting for us. 
No one was there to let us know what the format 
of the meeting would be. 
We began setting up mike stands so we 
could place them wherever we needed to, and shortly the pastor's 
wife, Mrs. Sooy, appeared. The church is 
large from the outside, 
having had what appears to be a number of additions put on 
it. 
It 
is all white clapboard. 
The sanctuary itself, however, 
is 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 80 
fairly small. 
There was an organ on one side of the room at the 
front and a piano on the other. 
Both were played by men during 
the service. 
The service was conducted for a "cluster" of Methodist 
churches in the area, and 
it was opened and closed by a young 
(late thirties) minister with a fairly gung—ho approach. 
He sort 
of cheer—led the audience into the spirit. 
This was a fairly 
informal service, but not as 
loose as the Singspiration service 
we recorded at the Landmark Baptist church the week before. 
Here 
the audience sat quietly except when they were asked to shout out 
songs they wanted to sing next. 
The chorister was a woman with a 
strong voice and a mean vibrato. 
Rev. Sooy, the pastor of the 
host church played a very small part in the conducting of this 
service. 
Early 
in the meeting the young minister had the people from 
the various churches stand up to be counted. 
A plaque was given 
to the church with the largest turnout--the host church was 
ineligible. 
Carl was asked to get up and explain to the 
congregation what we were doing. 
The order of the service can be 
seen 
in the tape logs and tapes (PFP83—RET013-015). 
It consisted 
of hymns sung by request and a few testimonies in the middle. 
There was no communion. 
After the service was over we were overrun with people 
wishing us well and expressing interest in our project. 
One 
woman in particular (these names are all 
in Sue's fieldnotes for 
this day--PFP83—RSS1009--she had the notebook while I handled the 
tape recorder) was very eager to help us. 
A little overeager, I 
thought. 
She said that we should send the tapes to her and she 
would get them to the pastor. She probably is very active in 
church work -- her husband was the organist. 
TX03: After we finished packing up our gear, Carl followed Sue 
and me to a service station, then we all 
stopped at the Peter Pan 
Diner in Millville or Vineland, I'm not sure which, for a bite to 
eat. 
There was some kind of a religious or holistic health 
booklet in the entry that we 
looked at. 
It had several 
references to a musical group with an east Indian—sounding name, 
and there were lots of health—foods kinds of ads. 
We couldn't 
tell what kind of a group published it. 
There was a plaque on 
the wall with good wishes for the proprietors of the diner from 
the staff at another diner--it appeared that this management was 
relatively new. 
I remember that Carl had ravioli and commented 
that it was pretty good. 
I don't remember what Sue and I had. 
The diner had a video room at the back--we didn't see 
it, but 
there were a couple of signs announcing its existence. 
We 
finished eating and departed for home, arriving around eleven 
o'clock.

This morning I went with Nora to visit her friend Steve 
Soviczky of Atsion. 
She wanted someone to come along and help 
with the sound recording as she drove Steve around and delved 
into his personal geography. 
We arrived at his house which is 
situated behind a gun club which 
is behind the old Richards 
mansion on Rt. 206 at G—Atsion; 20GT. 
Steve is a native of the 
area, and lives 
in an old house onto which he 
is building an 
addition. 
He has a couple of dogs--one he just recently adopted 
looks like nothing but skin and bones--and a goat named Avon who 
follows him all 
over his place. 
The addition on the house 
is 
larger than the original house. 
Nora has known him for some 
time, and she says that she has never seen the inside of his 
house. 
Before I met him she had told me about the square of 
unpainted surface on his house where a license number is written. 
The former owner of the house was painting one day when he 
spotted some men in a car. 
They appeared suspicious to him, so 
he wrote the license number on the house. 
It turned out that 
they had robbed a bank and this man's presence of mind led to 
their apprehension. 
Steve has not painted that part of the house 
because he wants to remember the incident and the man. 
We all 
piled into Nora's car to have Steve give us a tour of the Atsion— 
Tabernacle—Indian Mills area. 
I was in the back seat with the 
Nagra, and Steve was wearing a lavalier mike in the passenger 
seat. 
He was concerned mostly with historic sites that gave 
personality to the region. 
He directed Nora as she drove, and I 
would fill 
in with geographical locations for the tape. 
He came 
up with several alternate place names for roads and 
intersections. 
He walked us around the Tabernacle cemetery and 
showed us the graves of his ancestors and a woman known as Indian 
Ann. 
(The tapes are PFP83—RNR001 through 004.) 
We visited the 
site of his grandfather's farm and found it pretty well hemmed in 
by housing developments--we could not approach the place from the 
direction he used to do 
it. 
The housing developments were made up of 
large split—level 
houses with curbs and gutters out front and yards with the forest 
trees left in them. 
There was a man sweeping dead leaves out of 
his front gutter as we passed by, and at the time I thought it 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 82 
rather ludicrous that he would choose to build his house in the 
forest and then sweep the leaves away. 
I saw it as an indication 
that the people who come from the cities professing a desire to 
live with nature really do not want to be part of nature. 
They 
impose their concepts of order and culture on the wilderness just 
as much as anyone--probably more. 
The fact is that they have not 
had time to adapt to 
life 
in the woods the way the old—timers 
have. 
I later learned that keeping the leaves raked up 
is one 
deterrent to fire, but so 
is clearing some of the trees away from 
your house. 
I think that their choices relating to landscape are 
mostly determined by aesthetic rather than practical 
considerations. 
Curbs, gutters, neatly—kept yards, and lots of 
forest trees are part of the aesthetic of a city person living 
in 
the country. 
This will not change significantly until some of 
the suburban developments face a real threat from fire. 
Then I 
would expect some practical considerations to take precedence 
over purely aesthetic ones. 
TX02: 
In the afternoon I kept an appointment to have dinner with 
the Floyd West family of New Gretna. 
They had promised to 
acquaint me with their family favorite, Clam Pop Pie G—New Gretna; 
15GT. 
I was greeted by Betty, and I brought in all my gear. 
She 
said she was about to start peeling potatoes, so I set up a light 
and prepared to shoot pictures. 
I had also intended to tape our 
conversation as she cooked, but she was so petrified by the 
picture—taking that I decided to forego the recording. 
At first 
she was extremely stiff and felt like she had to pose for every 
picture, turning toward the camera, smiling, and stopping work 
every time I aimed the camera. 
Later she loosened up and 
commented that it wasn't so bad after all. 
CLAM POP PIE 
Grind or chop 25 medium—sized clams 
Peel and slice 8-10 potatoes 
Saute 1/4 lb. 
diced salt pork 
Dice 6-7 onions 
Add water to cover salt pork, onions, and potatoes 
Cook for about 15 minutes 
While cooking, make pop pie: 
Mix up baking powder biscuits (from Good Housekeeping

3 tsp. baking powder 
1 tsp. salt 
6-7 T. shortening 
about 2/3 to 3/4 C. milk 
Add clams and clam juice to potato mixture 
Add pop pie by spoonfuls and cook 20 minutes 
Serve dumplings on a plate and spoon the stew into a tureen. 
Betty had saran wrap spread over her cookbook to protect it 
from spatters. 
She brought out a cookbook that was put together 
by the local Presbyterian church, From Kitchen to Kitchen in New 
Gretna, that she prizes. 
It contains recipes contributed by 
local women, and many of them are seafood and cranberry or 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 83 
blueberry recipes. 
I asked if I could borrow the book for Sue to 
look over, and she wasn't sure whether she wanted to 
let it out 
of her house. 
She has one beat—up copy that she uses all 
the 
time, and then she has one mint—condition copy that she has been 
saving to give to one of her daughters. 
She said she didn't know 
what she would do, because all three of her girls would want the 
book, and she only had the two copies. 
I offered to make a xerox 
copy for her 
if she would loan us the book, and she finally 
relented. 
Sue was very glad to see the book, so I'm glad I made 
the effort. 
We continued to talk about recipes and cooking, and Betty's 
daughter Rebecca came in and joined us. 
She 
is nineteen years 
old and a beautiful girl with blonde hair. 
Betty brought out a 
bottle of beach plum jelly that she had made, and said she wanted 
me to take 
it home with me. 
I asked what beach plums were, and 
they said they were a tiny plum that is dark red with a pit. 
The 
tree grows best in sandy soil, hence the name beach plum. 
It has 
a white blossom in the spring that reminds Rebecca of a dogwood 
blossom. 
Betty, as she was preparing the meal, talked about being in 
a menu club when she was 
in school. 
The club was 
in charge of 
planning the school 
lunch menus, and they were told that color is 
important in meal planning. 
She brought this up because she 
thought that our meal that evening was going to be rather 
colorless, with the light—colored clam pop pie and coleslaw. 
Betty spent three years as an operating room nurse and three 
years as a private duty nurse before her children were born. 
After the first two were born, she worked for three years again 
as a private duty nurse. 
She has considered going back to work 
often, but has never done 
it since the third daughter (Rebecca) 
was born. 
She really enjoyed working as a nurse, and 
it was hard 
for her to give it up. 
I asked about cranberry recipes, and she said that they make 
Cranberry Crunch, a molded salad, for Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
It contains whole cranberry sauce, raspberry jello, celery, and 
walnuts. 
She also said that when she 
is 
lazy, she fixes 
individual salad molds with cranberry sauce, jello, and 
pineapple. 
Rebecca works at Allen's Clam Bar in G—New Gretna; 15GT, which 
she says (and others have said) is one of the best seafood 
restaurants in the region. 
They prepare very fresh fish. 
She 
said the casinos in Atlantic city have come asking how they have 
such good food. 
They make a clam stew and oyster stew--these are 
prepared basically with milk and cream, and they serve Manhatten 
clam chowder, which has vegetables in 
it, unlike stews. 
She gave 
the recipe for clam stew: 
ALLEN'S CLAM BAR CLAM STEW 
Minced clams 
Thatcher--83

page 84 
1/2 C. cream 
1/2 C. milk 
Cook just til 
hot. 
Serve with a chunk of butter. 
I would think there 
is some salt and pepper in this recipe, and 
she also neglected to say whether the clams are cooked before 
they are put in the stew. 
Someone better versed than I in 
coastal foodways would know. 
Rebecca went to school 
in Tuckerton with Thomas River kids 
before the new Penland High School was built, and she said that a 
lot of the kids were from Long Beach Island. 
They were the "in" 
group, known as "islanders." 
The kids from New Gretna were 
teased about being pineys and the standard kind of joke was, "Did 
you get running water out there in New Gretna yet?" 
There was 
definitely a distinction, too, between people from New Gretna and 
Tuckerton. 
Rebecca said that New Gretna people were seen as 
younger, and the town has more space and privacy. 
Tuckerton is 
home to people age 35 and up, and the pace 
is faster--more 
stores, more gas stations. 
Rebecca considers herself a piney and 
sees the 
label 
as one to be worn proudly. 
Betty, her mother, 
does not apply the term to herself and sees it as a derogatory 
term. 
After they discussed it for a while, Betty said, "Let's 
face it, 
I'm a piney. 
I've accepted it." 
But she really has 
not. 
The term means something different to the two generations. 
Rebecca said that city people think of pineys as 
living 
in huts, 
never going to town, being uneducated, and not talking right. 
I might add that after Rebecca had gone through all this, 
she said that when the new high school was built inland so that 
the pines kids went there, she didn't like 
it and found a friend 
in Tuckerton who let her use her address so that she could go to 
school with the islanders. 
Floyd was working outside with another man, and when dinner 
was ready, they were not, so Betty and Rebecca and I sat down to 
eat. 
When Betty began to set the dumplings (pop pie) out on a 
platter and spoon the stew into a tureen, I asked 
if when they 
didn't have company they just served it out of the dutch oven it 
was prepared in. 
She said, 
Oh, no. 
Floyd would never allow 
that." 
The table was set with nice china dishes, and she put on 
tiny fluted saucers for the coleslaw, which was just grated 
cabbage and mayonnaise. 
It was very good, with a mild flavor. 
She served clam pop pie to each of us from her chair, having us 
hand our plates to her. 
We served coleslaw to ourselves. 
It was 
a very good, hearty meal--good for a cool day like we had. 
After dinner, Betty and I each had a small dish of homemade 
vanilla ice cream, and Rebecca disappeared. 
While we ate our 
dessert, Betty went over the From Kitchen to Kitchen in New 
Gretna and made comments about the recipes and contributors. 
She 
pointed out a recipe for clam chowder that was contributed by 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 85 
Viola Pepper--"a real 
lady," according to Betty, who was from 
Jenkins and wore diamonds and furs and had a brother who was "a 
real piney." 
It turned out that the brother was Fred Brown, of 
John McPhee's book. 
Here, as so often, when someone refers to 
someone else as a piney, 
it 
is sotto voce, as 
if they are afraid 
someone will hear them say this slanderous thing about a person. 
Betty pointed out a recipe for clam hurrier, which is 
similar to clam pop pie except without the pop pie. 
This was 
contributed by Woodrow Allen, whose wife Dorothy contributed a 
recipe for deviled clam casserole. 
There were several deviled 
clam recipes, 
indicating that this might be a favorite in the 
region. 
Mrs. Elizabeth Palmer contributed a "Prize—Winning 
Cranberry Pie" recipe. 
There were some recipes for bread 
pudding, which Betty named as another regional favorite. 
It 
is 
simple, seasoned with vanilla. 
Mrs. Elizabeth Palmer also 
contributed a cranberry steamed pudding recipe. 
Other cranberry 
recipes included cranberry sherbet and sausage—cranberry 
sandwiches au gratin. 
I asked Betty about her blueberry muffins, and she said 
that she uses the plain muffin recipe in the Good Housekeeping 
Cookbook, increases the sugar and folds in one heaping cup of 
drained fresh blueberries. 
When I left, Betty invited me to come again for some other 
kind of dinner. 
I doubt, though, 
if my time would be best spent 
in that activity, considering the shortness of the work period 
remaining.

This was a busy day. 
I started it by going to G—May's 
Landing; IOGT to meet Barbara Roden of the Senior Citizen's Center 
there. 
She works with many of the Russians, and the center has a 
Russian interpreter. 
I arrived to find that Barbara and the 
interpreter had both forgotten the appointment. 
One of the 
ladies at the center called Barbara and she came back. 
As a 
result, we were somewhat hurried, and she was reaching to get 
information for me. 
As the old people came in, 
she would call 
to 
each one to come in and give me some names or information, much 
of which was interesting, but not what I came for. One woman, 
Hermine, was a German who had married an Italian, and she spoke 
German, English, and Italian. 
Another, Edith Michel, was German, 
but when she was a child she had her fingers and mouth 
"cracked"--slapped--both for speaking German and for being left— 
handed. 
I asked about the Russians in the area, and was introduced 
to a man who 
is a second—generation Russian. 
He, 
like many 
others, came to May's Landing from Patterson to retire. 
The 
Tolstoy Foundation brought some refugees over during the war. 
Many of the old people in the area now are people who left their 
children in Russia. 
Other Russian children have moved away from 
May's Landing. 
There 
is a hotel 
in May's Landing, the American Hotel, which 
Russians bought cooperatively in 
1954 and ran as a boarding 
house. 
They had a little book on the history of the hotel for 
sale there at the senior center at a price of $6.00. 
The second— 
generation man, Al, made a rather cryptic remark about Russians 
saving money by eating potatoes. 
Millville 
has an active Russian culture, and someone 
mentioned decorated eggs that are made there. (Millville is 
outside the boundaries of the Pinelands Reserve and does not have 
a municipality code.) 
There is a Russian Orthodox church in G—May's Landing; IOGT 
which now has, according to Barbara, only 13 members and a 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 87 
traveling priest. 
The secretary of the church is Katherine 
Efimenko, 10 E. 5th Street, May's Landing, phone: 625-0149. 
There is also a Russian settlement at New Kuban (location unknown 
at present--I will check back with them). 
This community also 
has a church and consists mostly of older people and farmers. 
They said that there are also a lot of Russian Jews who came 
over during the war. 
G—Mizpah; 10GT nearby, 
is now a black 
community but was settled by Jews (it was not specified whether 
they were Russians or not). 
I got three versions of the meaning 
of the name Mizpah. 
Barbara said she thought it meant "good 
luck" or "land of opportunity," while Ann Smith, a young black 
woman who lives there thought it meant "God's Country." 
One of 
the elderly women thought the name meant "bad land." 
I asked one woman named Helen what she likes about living 
in 
May's Landing (she was a life—long resident), and she said that 
she loves 
it because the people are friendly, the climate 
is 
mild, and 
it 
is not polluted. 
According to the black woman, Ann Smith, there is a 
congregation of black Mennonites (it is actually a mixture of 
blacks and whites) 
in G—Mizpah; 10GT. 
The pastor is Reverend 
Pittman, 476-2458. 
Corbin City was seen by the people I spoke to as a place 
where people with retarded children lived. 
Apparently there is 
some kind of a school there. 
A contact person in the area is Melvin Newton, who is head 
of the NAACP and lives 
in Mizpah. 
His number is 476-2416. 
It was very difficult getting a coherent conversation going 
in the setting at the senior center. 
There were lots of people 
coming in for lunch, and all 
of them chimed in on the 
conversation when the spirit moved them. 
Al 
was a terminal 
wisecracker, making it next to 
impossible for anyone to tell a 
complete story, or for me to ask directed questions of a single 
person. 
TX02: I left May's Landing and headed for Ancora to meet Sue for 
an 
interview with Clara Paolino, one of the women we met at 
Spaghetti Night at Toni's Custard in Hammonton. 
Clara lives near 
the G—Ancora Bridge; 33GT west of Hammonton on the White Horse 
Pike. 
Her house is very neat and clean--the kitchen was quite 
austere, she had so 
little on the counters and around. 
My 
impression was that it was all white, although I don't know if 
it 
was actually light green or some other pale color. 
When I 
arrived I started for the front door, and heard her call me from 
the side door by the carport. 
I went around and found her with 
the TV set on a soap opera with the volume very loud. 
While we 
chatted and waited for Sue to arrive, she left the TV on, making 
it very difficult to hear. 
I finally asked her if I could turn 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 88 
it down and she said to turn it off. 
She made an apology about 
just keeping them on for company and she just kind of 
liked to 
see what was going on. 
They weren't anything like life, anyway--
if we had all 
those problems, she didn't know what we would do. 
I began to set up the tape recorder and Sue arrived. 
We had 
a very friendly and enjoyable time talking to Mrs. Paolino--the 
interview almost had the quality of a morning chit—chat between 
neighbors. 
She seemed pleased that we were interested in her 
artistry as a cook, which indeed it 
is, 
and she explained at 
great length how she did various things. 
She didn't seem at all 
daunted by the microphones and cameras, and ran back and forth to 
the refrigerator, bringing out samples of the various foods she 
discussed. 
The thing that distressed me some of the time during 
the interview was Sue's and my verbosity when we should have kept 
our mouths shut, allowing her to express in completeness some of 
her thoughts on uniformity and aesthetics in food preparation. 
I 
think the tape could have had some real gems on 
it, and probably 
still does, with the help of a little editing. 
Clara Paolino's mailing address is White Horse Pike, Ancora, 
NJ 
08037. 
When I called to get directions to her house, she 
told me that she lived on the White Horse Pike at Ancora Bridge. 
She told me to 
look for the white house with green trim on the 
south side of the road with the new house being built next to it. 
(The new house is her son's.) 
I am making a place name form for 
Ancora Bridge since it 
is not listed in the gazetteer.

In the evening Sue and I drove down to G—Lower Bank; 26GT to 
visit with Warren and Eileen Homiller, RD 2, Box 2508, Egg Harbor 
City, NJ 
08215. 
We met Warren at the Lower Bank Volunteer Fire 
Company roast beef supper, and had told him at that time that we 
would like to visit with him and his family about fire companies 
and other aspects of their lives 
in a small river town. 
Eileen 
is 
an eighth generation native of the area, and her forebears 
have been cranberry and blueberry growers. Her genealogy is 
traced back to John Mathis, one of the earliest settlers of south 
Jersey. 
The Homillers live 
in an old two—story house that we 
couldn't see much of since we came after dark. 
We all 
sat in a 
very small and crowded living room that had walls painted a kind 
of dusty rose color. 
There was overstuffed furniture and a piano 
and a coffee table and a fireplace and lots of other things that 
combined to make the room cozy and inviting. 
Warren and Eileen 
had invited Eileen's cousin Barry Cavileer, who 
is the assistant 
fire chief of the Lower bank company now. 
I put one mike on Warren, who was sitting in an overstuffed 
chair, and another on Eileen and Barry, who were seated on the 
sofa. 
I think the tape will sound pretty good. (PFP83—RET018 and 
PFP83—RET019) 
Thatcher--83

They covered a range of subjects in relation to the fire 
companies and their operation. 
In addition, we got some insight 
into alternate place names in the area. 
They told us that 
Central Dispatch has a complete list of alternate place names in 
the county because they need to know them in order to answer 
emergency calls. 
(I 
later called Central Dispatch--Jerry 
Martinez was very helpful and told us we could come in and look 
over their computer list and pick out the "aka's.") 
One place that they mentioned was Island Road, which they 
used to call Nigger Island Road because it went out to a point on 
the river where an old black man lived named Joseph Mapes. 
They 
have now dropped the "Nigger" because of 
it's negative meanings. 
Other names they mentioned included Weber's Corner and Corson's 
Corner--they said both places are named because of the people who 
live or used to 
live there. 
The younger generation might not 
know what they were talking about if they used those names with 
them, but they do use them with people who have lived there a 
long time. 
Other names: 
Church Road, aka Old Church Road. 
I 
did not take time during this interview to have them locate these 
places on the map, but have made an appointment to do so. 
They 
are all 
in the Lower Bank area. 
I mentioned Pacemaker Bridge to 
them--the name told us by Nicky DiBlasi 
in 
an early interview--
and they said there was the Pacemaker Boat Yard, but not 
Pacemaker Bridge. 
They called it the Lower Bank Bridge. 
Here 
is 
an evident difference in names used by recreational users (Nicky) 
and residents of the area. 
I will be doing a place name form on 
this name, too.

Today Sue and I had a morning appointment with Mrs. Helen 
Zimmer, one of the ladies we met at the St. John's United Church 
of Christ Apple Festival 
in Egg Harbor City. 
We planned to go 
and interview her about her use of 
local plant material 
in 
wreaths and other decorative objects, and then we had to get back 
to the office by one o'clock to meet a local 
reporter. 
It turned 
out luckily that the reporter cancelled the appointment, because 
Mrs. Zimmer was just chock full of all 
kinds of exciting stuff. 
This day I was handling the cameras and Sue was doing the tape 
recording. 
We started out by sitting 
in the living room doing a 
standard interview with all 
the wreaths G—Devonshire; 12GT. 
(Devonshire is a district just north of G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT 
that does not appear on the map, but is not identified 
in any 
other way on the map.) 
The Zimmers live 
in an 
interesting house of their own 
construction. 
It apparently consisted only of what is now the 
kitchen, and over the years they have added on to 
it. 
Now the 
kitchen is the full width of the house at one end and the living 
room is the full width at the other end. 
They are connected by a 
hallway that runs along the back wall 
of the house, and other 
rooms and the cellar feed off the hall. 
The hall has windows, 
making it fairly unique among hallways, and 
it 
is wide enough to 
accommodate a few plants and assorted small 
items. 
The living 
room has a fireplace, and 
is a large, spacious room warmly 
furnished. 
It 
is painted a fairly dark green, and has a sofa, 
coffee table, chairs and other standard living room items. 
It 
is 
decorated here and there with dried flower arrangements done by 
Mrs. Zimmer. 
She also has little figurines and tiny floral 
arrangements on the window sills. 
Outside the front door today 
there was a large arrangement around a tree consisting of a shock 
of corn stalks, pumpkins, and potted mums. 
architecture. 
The house was quite dark, but was warm and full 
of a good 
smell when we arrived. 
We later learned that she had a pot of 
homemade split pea soup on the stove for us for lunch. 
We were 
enfolded into Mrs. Zimmer's routine so smoothly that it was 
incredible. During the interview Sue pursued questions of use of 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 91 
local materials in wreaths, methods of construction, and aspects 
of foodways while I shot pictures. 
I used a light because the 
room was extremely dark. 
In fact, I experimented with the 
umbrella and tungsten film, then I changed to a partially—used 
roll 
of daylight film and used the blue filter. 
It would be 
ideal 
if 
the filter and the umbrella could be used--I didn't like 
the harsh light with the filter. 
I'll 
be interested to see the 
pictures. 
After we finished the interview, we moved to the kitchen 
where I shot a few pictures of Mrs. Zimmer cutting spaetzle into 
the soup. 
I probably missed it though--I wasn't expecting to 
shoot pictures in there, so by the time I got the light moved in, 
I had missed most of 
it. 
(I violated Carl's prime instruction: 
"You know the girl scout's motto--be prepared. ") 
However, I did 
discover a whole variety of other things to shoot in the kitchen 
once I was there. 
Mrs. Zimmer was rendering chicken fat, which 
she uses for most of her cooking. 
She also had large enamel 
bowls full of peppers and cauliflower and other vegetables ready 
for making chow chow after lunch. 
In the corner was a crock 
containing cabbage—soon—to—be—sauerkraut. 
The kitchen was a real 
harvest celebration all 
by itself. 
(foodways) 
There was a round table covered with a cloth at one end of 
the room, and a built—in china cupboard behind it. 
Before 
setting the table, Mrs. Zimmer put a clean table cloth over the 
one that was already on the table. 
It was slightly smaller, so 
the cloth underneath hung down below the hem of the top one. 
They were not matched. 
Between the table and the cabinets on the 
other side was a wood stove which she said that she usually used 
when rendering fat, but the stove was not lit today and she 
wanted to show us how she did 
it, 
so she used the range. 
Opposite the stove was a wall cabinet whose top was crowded with 
old bottles that had been dug up on the Zimmers' property over 
the years. 
interiors. 
Sue left the tape recorder running during the preparation, 
consumption, and cleanup of the meal, as Mr. and Mrs. Zimmer were 
full 
of 
information that was interesting. 
After lunch, Mrs. 
Zimmer had Sue sit down with her to cut up the vegetables for the 
chow chow (a mustard pickle--in fact, 
it tastes exactly like the 
mustard pickles my mother makes). 
She made comments about how 
beautiful the colors were together and the aesthetic satisfaction 
of cooking and preserving foods. 
We stayed several hours, and I shot up several rolls of 
film. 
I also took pictures of her pantry in the basement, which 
was beautiful. 
While we were down there, they pointed out the 
concrete columns that Mr. Zimmer had constructed when building 
the house. 
He had used large round ice cream containers for his 
forms, so the columns were round with lines around them where the 
cartons came together.

Today I visited with Rabbi Abel Respes, the leader of a 
community of black Jews in G—Elwood; 12GT. 
Most of the rabbi's 
story is on tape (PFP83—RET022,023,024), so I will 
deal with 
other impressions here except to say that he has a wonderful 
conversion story that he tells very well. 
It involves growing up 
in Philadelphia and learning from his father and grandfather that 
he was not black, but Jewish.

architecture, interiors. 
There was no getting up to take pictures during the 
interview. 
For one thing, I had trouble with the earphones, and 
I was taking copious notes, fearing that the tape was not picking 
anything up. 
But even 
if I had not been occupied with notes, I 
believe I would have been held there by the rabbi's gaze and his 
speaking style. 
He was really in command of the situation. 
After we finished taping, I told him I would like to get some 
pictures, and he opened his Hebrew book of scriptures and posed 
in a reading posture. 
I should have asked him to 
look up, but I 
didn't, and I feel now that that is how he 
intended it. 
My 
impression 
is that these qualities are part of what makes him a 
man able to bring a colony of people to a new place and establish 
a settlement. 
The exterior of his house and the community is just as 
studiously formal as the interior, and almost as ornate. 
There 
are no borders around the yards in the form of hedges, fences, 
curbs, rocks, or anything. 
There are, however, flower beds with 
borders around them. 
In the open lawns are round beds of 
flowers, and along the houses are rectangular beds.

the gardening for the whole community. 
The photographs 
show some of the landscaping. 
I don't know the names of the 
flowers, but at the centers of the round beds are tall 
red 
flowers, and they are surrounded by progressively shorter kinds 
of flowers. 
TX02: Upon returning from my visit with the rabbi, I found Mal, 
Tom and Christine sitting around the kitchen table deep 
in 
discussion about the theoretical aims of this project. 
At first 
I went in to work in the other room, but when I started to fix 
myself some lunch 
in the kitchen, I was drawn into the 
conversation. 
The main concern that the three of them were 
expressing was that we were not going to accurately represent the 
views of the people we are studying, especially in terms of the 
stated goals of the project. 
Also, that if we don't carefully 
plan our research, that we and other researchers may not be 
welcomed back. 
I thought that the conversation was edging toward 
advocacy, but Christine corrected me on that. 
It still seemed to 
me that we were somehow trying to solve an unsolvable problem, 
because given normal cultural differences between student and 
studied, and the fact that this survey is 
limited to two and a 
half months, there is no way that we can be representative of all 
views 
in the region. 
I held out for open—ended listening and 
following whatever leads our contacts give us within the bounds 
of our interests, which are sense of place and people's 
relationships to the land. 
Mal felt that we must be much more 
structured in our approach and plan everything out before we go 
into the field so that we don't stray from our objectives. 
His 
advice was good, but we can run the risk of hearing only what we 
want to hear if we overstructure the project. 
We can miss 
Thatcher--83

valuable information. 
Actually, I felt that we were discussing things that had 
already been stated by the people at the Folklife Center. 
I had 
not felt the need for further clarification as the others seemed 
to feel. 
It made me wonder if I was being shallow in my 
understanding of the project. 
My perception is that the land—use 
recommendations are down the road. 
We cannot be expected to come 
up with pronouncements that will affect people's lives after only 
two months in the region. 
My understanding was that this 
is 
primarily a folklife project--we are studying traditional methods 
and attitudes in relationship to place. 
Later, these can be 
studied along with other data in order to make specific 
recommendations. 
I didn't get the impression from the 
formulators of the project that it should be anything more than 
that. 
I felt a little impatient with my colleagues in the 
discussion because I felt that they were jumping the gun a 
little. 
At this point in the project, I don't think that we 
should be focusing too narrowly on particular issues, because we 
still don't know which issues are the most important ones to 
close 
in on. 
As I understand it, 
that will be part of the next 
phase of the project if there 
is one. 
We are still outsiders, 
and we must be careful that we don't formulate our ideas based on 
our cultural biases or only on the input of one or two 
informants. 
Christine has mentioned her desire for group meetings in 
which we hash out some of these things. 
I think that is a good 
idea, but everyone's time schedules are so different that it 
would be something of an imposition to try to schedule a meeting 
every week. 
We have discussed some of these issues in a fleeting 
way 
in one—on—one discussions. 
Unfortunately, such discussions 
have a way of growing to fit the time available, and time 
is at 
such a premium here that I have avoided too much theoretical 
talk. 
Obviously, though, members of the team have differing 
concepts of what our work 
is 
all 
about. 
And that may not be so 
bad. 
The strength of team fieldwork is that it 
is not limited to 
the biases and interests of just one person. 
One final thought--even if we do get people's thoughts and 
feelings down accurately, there is no guarantee that the ultimate 
land—use recommendations would go along with those thoughts and 
feelings. 
The Pinelands is a huge area with diverse cultural 
resources. 
Each has a different world view, and a different way 
of using the land. 
There are bound to be conflicts. 
Our job is 
to first document those different approaches, then probably to 
recommend methods of peaceful co—existence and mediation. 
It 
will 
be extremely difficult. 
I don't imagine anyone will 
be 
entirely happy, no matter what the Commission does.

Sue and I headed south toward Buena to find a flea market 
Jens had mentioned. 
We couldn't find it (later found we were in 
the wrong place). 
On the way down Rt. 557 we saw a man in a bean 
field picking beans. 
This wasn't incredibly interesting, but the 
truck that was parked next to him was a rebuilt car. 
We stopped 
to 
investigate and discovered that his family runs a farm market 
just a few yards further down the road--Bertuzzi's Market G—Buena 
Vista; 03GT. 
While Sue shot pictures of the truck, I asked a 
little about it. 
The family owns four such car—trucks. 
Joe (the 
man 
in the field) said that two of them were family cars before 
they were converted into trucks, one was from a friend, and one 
was from a junkyard. 
They consist of a car body with the roof 
cut off, and most of the rear body cut off. 
The rear part is 
replaced with a flatbed made of wood, and metal frames are 
mounted at the front and the rear. 
These provide carrying space 
for irrigation pipes and equipment. 
Joe said that they have to 
use cars that were made before 1970 to make the trucks, because 
before that date cars were bolted together. 
After 1970 cars were 
welded together and are too hard to break apart. 
Joe sent us 
down to the market to photograph the other three trucks. 
He was 
not too talkative, but friendly. 
We went to the market and gave his wife our card, but she 
wasn't as open as he was, and would hardly talk to us. 
She just 
scurried around doing her work. 
They had a World Series game on 
the radio (as Joe did out in the field, too). 
The market was 
nicely arranged and had lots of Indian corn and gourds, and tons 
of pumpkins--none painted. 
They advertised a basket of gourds 
for $1.99, so I said I wanted one, and they poured the gourds out 
of the basket into a bag. 
I asked 
if I could buy the basket, 
too, and they said I could not. 
They sold onions, peppers, 
potatoes, and lemons 
in addition to the items mentioned above. 
I 
neglected to get an address for courtesy prints, but can look it 
up. 
TX02: We went on 
in search of the flea market, but when we 
couldn't find it we returned to a yard sale we had seen along 
557. 
It was a family affair run by the DeRosa family G—Milmay; 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 96 
03GT. 
I spoke to Albert DeRosa, a man about 30 years old, who 
told me about the activity. 
One of the first things he told me 
was that Milmay got its name because it's halfway between 
Millville and Mays Landing. 
There was a church right across the 
street from the location of the sale. 
I asked if 
it was where 
the family attends church, and he said, no, that it 
is St. 
Mary's, a mission church. 
The parish church 
is Our Lady of 
Pompeii. 
They have a small festival, but not nearly as big as 
the festival of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel at Hammonton, according to 
Albert. 
The location of the yard sale 
is the fruit stand of Albert's 
father, and it 
is right next to the father's house. 
The house 
is 
around 1920-30 vintage, shingled with green shingles. 
The stand 
is used very little now, except for a few peppers which are sold 
on the honor system--you choose the peppers you want, 
leave your 
money 
in a box, and take off. 
The stand closes in August. 
This 
was the first year the family has had the yard sale, which is an 
annual event, 
in the fruit stand. 
Usually it 
is held in Albert's 
front yard down the road, but since the weather was threatening, 
they moved it to the stand. 
Albert's father is a collector of 
old tools, so there were some planes, plows, doorknobs and other 
things of that ilk for sale. 
Other contributions to the sale 
were children's clothing and toys, adult's, especially women's 
clothes, odds and ends of small appliances, dishes and general 
junk. 
Marketing. 
Albert told me that most of the men 
in the Milmay area are 
employed in the construction business or are retired from it. 
Apparently there are few farmers anymore in this place that looks 
like 
it 
is or was primarily agricultural. 
It does not look 
particularly built up, and there are quite a few fields along the 
highway as well as houses. 
It may be that most of the farming is 
done by a few people. 
He said that out of 25 families in Milmay, 
12 are 
in construction--Local 48 of the union. 
There are two 
industries in the area--Royal Clothing, and a furniture factory 
"on the corner" 
(he pointed eastward down the road when he said 
this). 
As I explained to Albert what we were doing, and I 
discovered that he had been a life—long resident of the area, we 
began to talk about the woods. 
He said that he knew the woods 
pretty well. 
I asked if he had ever been lost, and he said only 
once, and that was at night. 
A friend had asked him to go coon 
hunting with him, and they got lost because they could not see 
the 
landmarks they were used to. 
He also uses the sun to 
locate 
himself. 
He said that they would pass right over fire lines and 
deer trails without knowing it because they couldn't see them. 
The Milmay Gun Club has marked all 
the woods 
in this area with 
gashes on trees. 
Albert is a member of 
it. 
It has 34 members, 
18 of whom are local. 
Most of the outsiders are from Vineland. 
I asked about women doing the cooking for the gun club, and he 
said that his father does it for their club. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes

I spoke briefly to two of Albert's aunts, Jennie Sharpless 
and Betty DeRosa. 
They were trying to grab a bite of 
lunch while 
we were there, so I didn't want to bother them too much. 
Betty 
talked about how she used to work for the school district--I 
think driving a bus--but she got mad and quit when they started 
sending Milmay kids to Port Elizabeth and Leesville for school 
instead of keeping them in the township. 
She went on at some 
length about the problem. 
There was a wine press in the back of the stand that was 
built by Betty's husband Ernie. 
He apparently built it from 
plans or a kit that he sent for. 
They said that they are 
in the 
midst of winemaking right now. 
This is the first year they have 
done 
it, 
and Betty was unclear on the details, such as where the 
grapes come from. 
It is definitely her husband's project. 
Send courtesy prints to Albert DeRosa, Mays Landing Road, 
Milmay, NJ, 08340. 
As we drove back toward Buena, we discussed how cottage 
industries are a real strong pattern here. 
People sell 
everything from doghouses to mums. 
They raise and sell produce, 
make Halloween and other kinds of dolls, have yard sales, make 
trellises, and any number of other things. 
I have seen signs 
advertising dwarf bunnies for sale G—Green Bank; 26GT, eggs 
G—Chatsworth; 27GT, and snapping turtles G—Chatsworth; 27GT. 
On 
this Saturday we noticed older women bundled up 
in jackets and 
scarves sitting in the sun 
in vacant lots and parking lots with 
tables full of second—hand goods for sale G—Buena; 02GT. 
TX03: After we left the Buena area we headed toward Hammonton to 
Joe's Maplewood restaurant G—Hammonton; 1IGT on the White Horse 
Pike. 
This was the restaurant recommended to us by Ralph Putiri 
as having the best spaghetti 
in the region. 
It was fairly empty 
except for a few men 
in the bar watching the World Series and 
arguing about the game and the players. 
In the dining room, 
which is very conservative and ordinary—looking--something I 
would expect the moderately well—heeled senior citizen set to 
like--we were the only diners except for a a moderately well— 
heeled senior citizen—type couple. 
This was about two p.m. 
We 
ordered ravioli and felt it 
lived up to the reputation it had for 
excellent pasta. 
It was really good. 
TX04: We decided to head home through New Gretna so we could 
photograph some Halloween decorations Sue had seen the other day. 
However, a huge tin chicken on top of the White Way Market on the 
White Horse Pike between Hammonton and G—Egg Harbor City; 06GT 
caught our eyes. 
I was feeling a little under the weather this 
day, so I stayed in the car while Sue went in to talk to the 
proprietor, Jeff Klotz, who leases the stand from the owner, Tony 
Lacktis. 
Lacktis lives right next to the stand in a big white 
house. Lacktis built the stand forty years ago, and it was one of 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 98 
the first fruit stands on the pike. 
I could hear chickens in the 
background, and there was a fairly large lawn and a dog house in 
the back. 
The market itself was neatly arranged, but sparse 
in 
goods when compared with other markets in the area. 
Pumpkins 
were lined up on the ground under the west wing of the roof, and 
corn shocks were tied to the posts supporting that roof. 
The 
office was small 
in the center of the structure, and the east 
wing sheltered potato sacks, a few pumpkins and plants, and a few 
other items. 
Along the edge of the sheltered area was a low 
shelf with apple baskets alternated with pumpkins. 
It was a 
pleasing effect, and different from the abundant look of the 
other markets. 
It was an effective method for arranging a few 
items 
in an aesthetically pleasing way. 
architecture. 
Klotz hasn't been 
in this business very long, but seemed to 
enjoy it from what Sue said. 
He opens in March with spinach and 
Easter flowers, and closes in December, when he takes off to 
visit relatives in Florida. 
TX05: We went on to New Gretna via the Garden State Parkway, and 
found the house with the Halloween decorations Sue had seen. G—New 
Gretna; 15GT. 
It was the home of the parents of Harold Cramer, 
Rt. 9 Box 12, New Gretna, NJ 08224. 
Harold is a very shy 18— 
year—old. 
He lives with his parents, and we spoke first to his 
older brother and his mother. 
Harold at the time was across the 
street babysitting for his sister. 
The home was ca. 1915 white 
clapboard bungalow style, surrounded by a fence and had large 
evergreens in the yard. 
I didn't notice if they were pines or 
spruces or what. 
The decorations were on the porch, and 
consisted of a huge string spiderweb that Harold had painted with 
green fluorescent paint, a ghost made out of a sheet suspended in 
the corner, and a scarecrow—type figure sitting in a chair. 
When 
Sue had passed the house last week, the figure had been on one 
side of the porch. 
Now it was moved to the other side, and we 
found out that it was so the old man across the street could see 
it. 
Harold likes to decorate for Halloween and Christmas, and 
the old man looks forward to seeing what he comes up with each 
year 
The family had lost a son 
in a car accident about a year 
ago, and the mother mentioned it a couple of times 
in how it has 
affected their lives. 
She had a couple of rhododendrons planted 
on each side of the porch stairs, and she takes especial care of 
one because she planted it before her son died because he 
liked 
it. 
Harold almost didn't decorate last year in the wake of the 
tragedy, but his mother urged him to do 
it anyway because he 
enjoys it so much and his brother would have wanted him to do 
it. 
We promised courtesy prints. 
As we headed north out of New Gretna, we stopped to 
photograph a scarecrow by the entrance to a drive. 
The house is 
back 
in the trees. 
This was just before the curve 
in the road 
where N. Maple Ave. (Spur 563) forks into Allen road and

This morning I accompanied Sue to the Egg Harbor City 
Volunteer Fire Department breakfast G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT. 
This 
is a nice modern fire house. 
I was handling the cameras on this 
jaunt, and Sue took notes, so her fieldnotes for this date should 
be a little more detailed than mine. 
The room in which the meal 
was held was similar in theme to others we have visited, but 
still had its own character. 
At the back was a nice bar, very 
much like you would find in any pub, complete with beer signs and 
nice wood. 
Some of the other places we visited 
either had no 
bar G—Lower Bank; 26GT or had a very simple one or two G—Cologne; 
09GT. 
There was also a pool table 
in front of the bar with a nice 
shaded light over it. 
We were seated at round tables rather than 
long rectangular ones--again this 
is different from the other 
dinners we have attended. 
We spoke to a young fireman who was 
serving, and he said that they expected something in the 
neighborhood of 600-800 people at this breakfast, a much smaller 
number than other companies serve at their dinners. 
I don't know 
if they have some other source of 
income, like a major 
benefactor, but it seems there must be funds coming in from 
somewhere else, judging from the nice building and facilities. 
There is the factor that breakfast food is cheaper to produce and 
serve than elaborate dinners. 
Here all 
the work was done by the men and a few teenagers. 
No women were taking part except for one teenage girl that was 
busing tables. 
There is apparently an active women's auxiliary, 
because there were plaques inside and outside of the building 
that honored various people and events, and they were donated by 
that auxiliary. 
The men we spoke to were very cordial, and helped us as much 
as they could. 
One man, who was taking tickets and seating 
people, was wearing a fire captain's uniform. 
He 
is now retired, 
but is still active 
in the company--even answers fire calls 
if 
they promise to be exciting. 
All 
the men acting as waiters were 
wearing white coats. 
I took some pictures of the bar, and when the man tending 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 101 
bar saw me, he held up a sign that had been sitting there that 
stated his preference in the World Series. 
I spent the rest 
of the day working at notes and logs at home.

Today was the mid—project meeting, for which Alan, Carl, 
Mary, and all 
the project team met at the Pinelands Commission. 
It was an all—day proposition in which we talked about what we 
have been finding in our regions. 
Henry Glassie was present to 
give his input on what we have done so far and where we ought to 
be going. 
John Sinton and Barry Brady were there from the 
Pinelands Commission. 
Each of us talked informally about our best informants--I 
spoke about the Putiris and 
Mrs. Zimmer and Eileen Homiller. 
We 
also talked about the directions in which we would like to go. 
The things I expressed interest in pursuing were: 
The nature of property line markings--fences, shrubs, mowed 
lines, etc. 
The concept that old timers clear away the trees, 
but newcomers put in curbs and gutters. 
(John Sinton commented 
that curbs and gutters are a matter of 
law 
in some places.) 
The use of native and non—native plants in 
landscaping. 
Distribution of plants 
in yards. 
The garden—to—kitchen connection and gender roles associated with 
it. 
The woods and gender roles, 
including seasonal cycles and 
occupational versatility. 
Yardscapes and gender roles. 
Yard art as expression of community or individuality. 
Use of local materials in crafts and decorating. 
Gender roles 
in fire companies, churches, and other local 
institutions. 
Gun clubs and gender roles. 
Contrary to what Mary 
suggested at the beginning of the project, men do all 
the cooking 
in the clubs I have heard about, making the clubs a very 
exclusive male domain. 
Gender roles 
in recreational uses of the land. 
Obviously, I can't follow up on all 
these topics, but they 
can be investigated to some degree in a few well—chosen 
interviews. 
Some of the other fieldworkers planned to do some 
interesting things--I was intrigued by Tom's plan to follow white

cedar through its travels from swamp to various uses. 
At one point in the meeting we got into a discussion of our 
position as folklorists in a very hot political situation. 
We 
talked about what we could and should do 
in terms of making 
recommendations for land use and also 
in protecting informants 
from people who would use our computerized information for uses 
other than those for which it was intended. 
Barry Brady told us that any recommendations we make must be 
legally defensible. 
I pondered the difficulty of writing laws to 
protect culture that also allow it to change as 
it needs to do. 
I still was keenly aware that we were more outsiders coming in 
and trying to 
influence policy that would affect the lives of 
natives. 
The Pinelands Interpretation Committee meeting struck 
me the same way, although not quite so much--there were a few 
local people there. 
When such discussions come up, I feel that 
we need years, not weeks, to properly study this region. 
As 
it 
is, 
we need to observe very carefully, and try to keep cultural 
bias to a minimum (oh boy). 
It was good to exchange information and ideas the way we 
did, and to hash out some things. 
I came away from the meeting 
feeling renewed.

This morning I went to G—Forked River; 49GT with Mal 
to 
visit with Cliff and Lucille Frazee. 
Mal has done some work with 
the Frazee family already, going out into the cedar swamp with 
Cliff, who cuts cedar for a living. 
Mal had mentioned that he 
is 
intrigued by the work ethic 
in the family which motivates 
everyone, husband, wife, children, to stay constantly active. 
Lucille makes dolls, which piqued my interest, and with Mal's 
mention of the work roles of all family members, I asked if I 
could go along. 
The house used to be a soda bottling plant and a garage 
before Cliff bought it and began to remodel 
it. 
The shell was 
there, and he put in the partitions. 
I noticed that there was a 
lot of wood paneling as well 
as kitchen cupboards and regular 
woodwork in the house. 
All 
of 
it was natural--no paint anywhere 
on the wood surfaces. 
This seemed to tie 
in with Cliff's work 
with wood and concern for preservation and reseeding of cedar 
swamps. 
He likes wood. 
In his back yard is a huge cut tree 
trunk that arches across half the yard like a piece of modern 
sculpture. 
I didn't get a close look at 
it because the weather 
was bad, but interestingly enough, 
it appears to be painted a 
dull green--or may be moss. 
In the interview it seemed that 
Lucille was the one that preferred the woodwork in the house to 
be 
in 
its natural condition. 
They talked about how the indoors 
is her domain, while the outdoors is his. 
They indicated that 
this was by agreement from early on 
in their marriage. 
She made 
all 
the decorating decisions, and said that she doesn't believe 
in painting wood. 
She didn't even stain it. 
Lucille also built some youth beds and a gun cabinet for 
Cliff. 
I went out to see it--it was far too dark to photograph, 
and they were tired, so I didn't ask to set up the lights. 
The 
cabinet was very plain, with opaque fiberglass panels in the top 
half--Cliff didn't want people to be able to see the guns inside. 
Below the two top doors were two horizontal closed shelves that 
she designed for his map collection, but they weren't functional 
in some way, so the maps are stored elsewhere and the bottom 
shelves of the cabinet are being used for general storage. The 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 105 
corners on the cabinet are square, and there is no decorative 
routing, carving, or other shaping. 
The square corners of doors 
and the cabinet itself are just lightly beveled or sanded to 
soften the lines and probably to prevent splinters and injuries. 
When we arrived, Lucille said that she was really tired 
because she had the grandchildren there, and there were several 
other things that had worn her out in 
recent days. 
They 
suggested that we sit around the kitchen table because the kids 
were 
in the next room watching cartoons. 
I asked (for the first 
time I remembered to do so) 
if we could unplug the refrigerator 
if we were to sit in the kitchen, and I also asked 
if there was a 
door we could close between the living room and the kitchen to 
reduce some of the TV noise. 
There was no door to close, but the 
kids did turn the TV down some. 
Still, there will be some noise 
on the tape. 
The Frazees were a little scared of the tape recorder and 
the attention--especially Cliff. 
Lucille proved to be a good 
talker--when Cliff would let her--and conscious yet not terribly 
afraid of the recorder once we got going. 
She even added 
explanatory material when Cliff made gestures so I didn't have to 
do 
it! 
I was amazed. 
She tried to explain to Cliff why we were 
interested in them--he apparently was having a hard time 
understanding why we had chosen them to interview so thoroughly. 
She explained to him that we probably were just picking a few 
people to study since we couldn't do everyone. 
Much of the conversation revolved around Cliff's deep 
concerns about fostering the regrowth of cedar. 
I think he 
perceived this as his forum--a chance to be heard by 
policymakers. 
As a result, Lucille did not get to say much when 
the four of us were sitting around the table. 
Once, when I had 
asked a question relating to the cedar swamps, she attempted to 
clarify the answer for me, and Cliff said, "Are you telling this 
or am I?" 
I think they are a family with clearly—drawn gender 
roles. 
She seemed to be speaking to me woman—to—woman, but was 
unable to do so to any great degree because Cliff would turn the 
conversation back to the male, or his, angle on things. 
Toward 
the end of our visit, when Cliff was getting fidgety (by that 
time, I had willfully turned the conversation to Lucille's 
cooking and dollmaking), we split up. 
The men went out of the 
room and Lucille and I remained in the kitchen to 
look at her 
dolls. 
Unfortunately, the tape ran out about that time, and 
since we were getting ready to 
leave, I let her encourage me not 
to put a new tape on. 
It was during this time that she really 
began to talk to me woman—to—woman. 
She took me out to see the 
gun cabinet she built, and in the course of the conversation she 
talked about some surgery she had had, and shared some other 
things about her work. 
She takes great pride 
in those dolls, and 
she also is proud of her family's background in the restaurant 
business. 
She won a prize for one of her dolls recently.

The kitchen is cramped but clean and organized. 
We began to 
talk about recipes, and she pointed out that she had her family's 
rice pudding recipe written directly on the wood inside the door 
of one of her kitchen cupboards. 
It was right at eye 
level, 
along with her social security number and some notes that were 
taped to the door. 
The recipe was as follows: 
RICE PUDDING 
1/2 C. rice 
1/2 C. sugar 
1 qt. milk 
1 egg 
1 tsp. vanilla 
Simmer on top of the stove, or bake. 
It has a tendency to boil 
over, so use a large pot. 
This recipe is not verbatim as written on the door, but 
includes some instructions she gave me verbally to make sure that 
it would work. 
For instance, she added that it could be baked, 
but she always cooks 
it on top of the stove. 
She also added the 
advice about using a large pot. 
This was her great grandmother's 
recipe. 
Her family is a restaurant family, and this recipe was 
used 
in the family's Ides Diner in Newark, NJ, where Lucille is 
from. 
I took a photograph of the cupboard door with the recipe 
on 
it. 
(foodways) 
Lucille's dolls are really works of art. 
She began with a 
pattern for "cabbage—head" dolls that has achieved popularity 
across the country through women's magazines and other avenues. 
However, she was not satisfied that they looked as good as they 
could, so she began to experiment with sculpting the faces 
through cutting the cloth in different shapes and then using a 
needle and thread to pull and shape the features. 
She has some 
dolls with moveable arms and 
legs that she has also modified from 
the design she first learned. 
The pattern she learned called for 
arms and legs to be attached with buttons on the outside, and 
they were not aesthetically pleasing. 
She figured out a way to 
put disks inside the body and the extremities and attach them 
without any visible mechanics. 
She also prides herself on being 
the only person who makes dolls of this type with separate 
fingers. 
She had to 
learn how to shape them correctly, working 
with the stretchy material until they were the right shape. 
I 
might add that Cliff volunteered this information about the 
stretchy material, indicating some pride in his wife's works. 
The hair is made of yarn that is carefully stitched on the head 
in 
individual strands. 
She sells these dolls for $75. 
Some of 
the clothes she puts on them are copied from baby clothes. 
I enjoyed visiting with Lucille, but felt that I really 
didn't have an opportunity to get to know her well enough. 
By 
the time we got to her work and interests, all of us were tired, 
it was lunchtime, and Mal 
had another appointment to get to. 
She 
would not allow me to take any pictures of her, as she 
is 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 107 
sensitive about her appearance. 
I did, however, get pictures of 
her rice pudding recipe and some of her dolls. 
As we were about to 
leave, 
it came out that Cliff is a 
bottle collector, and he took us up to the third—floor attic of 
their house where he has boxes and boxes of bottles he has dug 
up. 
He organizes them by shape, and knows which ones are more 
valuable. 
He figured, I believe, that he had somewhere in the 
neighborhood of 10,000 bottles. 
He doesn't sell them--just 
collects them. 
The Frazees were a little different than some of the other 
people I have met on this project who are very gregarious--the 
Putiris and the Zimmers, for instance, but they were cordial and 
really seemed to enjoy the visit. 
It looks like Mal 
is doing a 
good job of establishing rapport with Cliff. 
TX02: 
In the evening, Sue and I attended a 4—H Halloween party 
near Medford on a horse ranch called Flora Lea Farms. 
I think 
this was 
in G—Evesham; 16GT, just a mile or two south of Rt. 70. 
The exact location will be 
in Sue's notes for this date. 
We had 
not been able to get in touch with the 4—H people in advance to 
see 
if 
it was OK for us to come, so we just crashed the party. 
They were very hospitable to us, and we had an enjoyable time. 
We spoke mainly through the evening to Dawn Richards, the county 
4—H agent, and Mary Robbins, a leader of a needlecraft club 
in 4— 
H. 
Mary told us that her club 
is quite active, and they are 
currently reviving (her word) "chicken scratching" or 
"snowflaking" embroidery. 
This is a type of embroidery on 
gingham that results in a snowflake—like effect. 
If 
it 
is the 
same thing that I have run into in Colorado, 
it 
is also called 
butterfly or snowflake embroidery. 
It was just coming into vogue 
there this past year or so, too. 
Mary's club 
is also doing 
knitting. 
She mentioned in passing that the 4—H sponsors 
clogging groups here, too. 
The Halloween party involved people of all 
ages--there were 
very small children there, and there were the adult leaders. 
Mary made an effort to teach us about the set—up of 4—H, 
explaining that it 
is all 
volunteer, and that there is a 
preparatory organization for children ages 7-9. 
This party was 
totally organized and run by the kids 
in 4—H. 
Teenagers took 
charge of the games, refreshments, and admission table. 
The 
adults were strictly in the background as guests. 
The general groups of activities were games with prizes for 
the winners, a pumpkin contest, a costume parade and contest, and 
a haunted house designed and manned by the kids. 
The party has 
been held at Flora Lea Farm for the past five years. 
The farm is 
owned (or maybe just run) by Polly and Paul Adams. 
The party 
used to be a hay ride and weenee roast, but two years of bad 
weather caused them to move it to the big barn at this farm. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 108 
Mary took us over to the haunted house before it opened, and 
we saw a trunk which was going to have a body 
in 
it, 
thread 
hanging from the ceiling like spiderwebs, and a ghost made of 
some old drapes and suspended so that it would swoop down a wire. 
Mary also said she thought they were 
going to put balloons under 
the rug, play a tape of Halloween sounds, and 
let the victims put 
their hands into bowls of wet grapes (eyeballs) and cooked 
spaghetti (intestines and brains). 
We went back to the barn 
in time to see the costume parade 
circling in the center of the big building. 
Among the prizes 
given were one for the ugliest adult, two for the most original, 
one each for the cutest (won by four young children in cat 
suits), the littlest, and the best witch. 
A family dressed in 
army fatigues won some kind of a prize. 
After the costume prizes 
were awarded, they broke the guests up 
into age groups for games. 
Each group played each game for a while then rotated to the next 
one. 
The games included passing an orange under your chin to the 
next person's chin; passing Lifesavers candies on toothpicks held 
in the mouth; stomping balloons tied to everyone's feet; sack 
races; and two people eating to the center of a licorice string 
"and hope you're with a friend," said Mary. 
The parents of the four young children in the cat costumes 
were Chuck and April Hughes, P. 0. Box 736, Easthampton, NJ, 
08060. (Send courtesy prints). 
Chuck 
is 
in his early thirties 
and has just been elected chairman of the leaders' council. 
He 
said that they used to 
live 
in New Gretna, but it got too 
crowded. 
The Hughes children were Dak, Zeb, Alia, and Ulysses. 
Among the costumes we saw were punk girls, farmers, a gypsy 
(Nikki Asper), a horse (Jennifer Saxton and Dawn Dellaporte), 
mummers, cowboys, M.A.S.H. characters, clowns, Tabernacle 
cheerleaders, a Karate outfit, and a few people dressed in any 
old clothes they could get their hands on, 
including what looked 
like grandmother's coat and hat. 
We spoke with Judy Welsh of Vincentown, who heads up a 
community club 
in which kids can do any of a number of projects, 
including poultry, conservation, forestry, dairy, goat raising, 
etc. 
They can do more than one project. 
It used to be a horse 
club, but Judy realized that most kids couldn't participate 
because of the expense, so she got it changed. 
In 1980, the boys 
in her club rebuilt a tractor. 
While we were talking to Judy, I noticed that a teenage boy 
and girl were in charge of the games. 
The boy had the bullhorn 
that they used to give directions, and during the games he was 
shouting encouragement, mediation, and was cheering the littlest 
ones on 
in the games. 
Refreshments were served about an hour after the party 
started, and they included hot dogs (I thought I heard someone 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 109 
refer to a "double—fisted" one--with two hot dogs 
in 
it), hot 
cider, and cold cider. 
They said they were also supposed to have 
hot chocolate, but that they were having trouble with the hot 
pot. 
(I wondered if 
it was because we were using their extension 
cord for our lights.) 
I spoke for a while with Polly Adams, the proprietor of the 
farm, and she told me that the farm is a horse farm, and that 
they participate in polo games every Sunday. 
Her phone number is 
654-8183. 
She said that tomorrow they were going to have a game 
at Doc Wiseman's place on Jennings Road near Medford Circle. 
She 
said that they play paddock polo, which uses a shorter field with 
indoor polo rules--three on a side and an inflated ball. 
Recreation. 
Polly also told me about Johnny Engel who goes coon hunting. 
Robin Engel's mother does dried apples (dolls). 
I told Polly 
that we would get the particulars from her when we called later. 
The last thing we did before leaving the party was look at 
the decorated pumpkins. 
There were almost no carved pumpkins--
most of them were painted. 
There were also not just pumpkins, 
but pitcher gourds, zucchinis, and onions. 
There was one 
zucchini that was carved out with corn kernels for teeth and long 
thin peppers for a nose and horns. 
Just before we left, some of 
the young children were bobbing for apples with the assistance of 
some of the adults. 
This was an interesting photographic problem. 
The barn was 
so huge that what light there was was really swallowed up. 
We 
set up one of our lights without any filters or umbrellas or 
anything, and moved the light to various locations. 
However, 
this was limiting and we should have had a flash attachment so 
that we could have moved freely. 
Sue did the photography for 
this gig, and I took notes.

This morning Mary and I got up early to go on a fox hunt 
and try to record the dogs and hunters. 
Mary has worked for 
several years with this subject, and knows these hunters pretty 
well. 
We went out to meet them at 5:30 a.m. while it was still 
dark. 
We waited outside one house for quite a while, thinking 
that the men would congregate there. 
They didn't, so we went in 
search of them. 
Mary listened for the dogs, and we drove to 
where they were. 
This proved to be a difficult problem in 
recording. 
For 
one thing, 
it was raining, and that made it even more difficult, 
since we were concerned about protecting the equipment. 
We used 
the hypercardioid and a radio mike. 
The radio mike we hooked to 
Vernon's lapel 
(Mary will have everyone's names in her notes for 
this date--I was just the piano player on this trip), and we used 
the hypercardioid for locating and recording the dogs as they 
trailed the fox. 
The problem was one of mobility, because the whole sport of 
fox hunting as 
it 
is practiced by these men 
is one of jumping in 
and out of cars and moving closer to where the dogs are. 
We 
began with Mary carrying the Nagra in a harness, and I was 
holding the big mike. 
However, we had a problem with trying to 
keep up with the men and manage the equipment at the same time, 
plus we still had the rain to contend with. 
So we set up the 
Nagra in the car's front seat where I could watch it and it was 
safe from moisture. 
Then we added some cable to the mike so that 
Mary could travel with 
it while I remained in the car. 
Our 
biggest problem was communicating with each other, and 
in the 
excitement of the moment I know I was guilty of several 
interruptions of great sounds. 
Now that we know what the 
problems are, I want to go back and do 
it again and get a better 
recording. 
I think 
it will take at least one other person to 
help handle the equipment and cables. 
Now I know what "gaffer" 
and "best boy" must be on movie credits. 
They carry cable and 
move equipment. 
We will also have to work out some system of 
silent communication between the person with the headphones and 
the one(s) handling the mikes. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 111 
Toward the end of our adventure, the radio mike seemed to 
poop out. 
We checked a lot of things, but finally, when we had 
decided to remove the mike from the informant, I noticed that he 
had zipped his jacket up over the mike. 
Argh! 
So, I hope we'll 
have better luck next time. 
The activity itself, for which I did not have much 
enthusiasm at first, rapidly grabbed my interest. 
It 
is really 
fun, 
listening and chasing all over the countryside after those 
dogs, which are after the fox. 
There was one other woman on the expedition besides 
ourselves, and that was one of the wives, and she stayed in 
the 
truck doing handwork the whole time. 
The men really seem to 
enjoy the social aspects of this activity. 
They just stand 
around and shoot the breeze while they wait for the dogs at 
different locations. 
They discuss the different dogs and their 
qualities, and they talk about other hunters and their approach 
to the sport. 
I really don't have too much I can say about the 
people, because I was in the car most of the time. 
Toward the 
end we let a couple of the men listen to the headphones while we 
had the hypercardioid aimed at the location of the dogs. 
At this 
particular point, the men couldn't hear the dogs at all 
and were 
waiting until they could hear them and pinpoint their location. 
When one man found he could hear the baying on the phones, he 
exclaimed, "We've got to get us one of these!" 
One of the funny aspects of the experience was the repeated 
assertion by Vernon that the dogs were going to cross the road 
right in front of us 
in this or that location, and they never 
did. 
It also happened that I saw the fox twice during this 
outing, and Mary, 
in her years of work with this sport, has yet 
to see it. 
Beginner's luck, I guess. 
I believe all 
of this 
day's activity took place somewhere in the northeastern portion 
of G—Woodland Township; 27GT. 
In the afternoon, Mary, Christine and I had to go and speak 
to the New Jersey Folklore Society meeting. 
This was all 
right, 
except that I still feel 
like I've only scratched the surface in 
the region, and I didn't really have much of significance to say. 
The most humiliating aspect of the afternoon was that every one 
of us had gotten our slides 
in backwards. 
Incompetence.

I am writing some notes for one day when we were in 
Nashville for the American Folklore Society Meetings, because I 
met a woman who had some experience with some French parks that 
are trying to preserve culture. 
I thought it might have bearing 
on the Pinelands National Reserve concept. 
The woman was Jo 
Kibbee, a librarian at Western Kentucky, where she 
is also 
working on a folklore degree. 
Jo and her husband went to France and stayed in a bed and 
breakfast place that was really just the home of a working farmer 
in a district that had been declared a national park. 
There are 
certain areas of France that are eligible to form themselves into 
such parks because they are 
in areas attractive to tourists and 
because they have somewhat depressed local economies. 
If a 
region meets the requirements for tourist interest and other 
things, several towns can voluntarily group themselves together 
into a national cultural and natural park. 
Then certain 
regulations go 
into effect regarding building and other changes 
on the landscape. 
For instance, farmers can get government 
subsidies if they want to remodel or restore an old thatched 
barn, but they cannot get the government help 
if 
they want to 
build a cinderblock building. 
Not only are the objects 
preserved, but the traditional methods of the area are 
encouraged. 
Many local 
residents convert their homes into bed 
and breakfast establishments, which brings in extra money and 
allows tourists to interact more closely with the local culture. 
The voluntary nature of this set—up impresses me. 
The park 
charters differ from region to region. 
Also, the concern with 
the 
local economy is one that I'm not sure has been adequately 
addressed in the Pinelands. The French park service doesn't 
organize so much as publicize local activities to which tourists 
are invited. 
However, there are ecological museums and other 
interpretive efforts. 
Some of the problems are that not all 
residents want to preserve the old ways; there is some resentment 
of the building imperatives; there 
is not genuine local control; 
and tourists are not universally welcomed with open arms. 
As Jo 
said 
in her paper on this subject, "The parks aren't going to 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 113 
keep the traditions alive--only the people can do that." 
Jo said that she would send me some of the literature they 
gathered while 
in France, and she gave me the name of the French 
agency responsible for the parks: 
the Federation of Natural (or 
National?) Regional Parks. 
She said it would probably be under 
the French equivalent of the Department of Interior. 
I'm not sure that the French have solved all 
the problems of 
trying to legally protect cultural resources, but perhaps we can 
learn something from them. 
It may be, of course, that our 
National Park Service has already studied the French program.

I accompanied Sue to the Post Office today and found 
myself involved with a walking tour of G—New Lisbon; 21GT. 
The 
postmaster, Mr. Doyle, said he was available this morning, so Sue 
asked if I would handle the cameras while she did the recording. 
We returned to the house for our equipment and embarked on the 
tour, which proved to be most enjoyable. 
Most of the time I was 
out of earshot of their conversation as I shot photographs, so I 
can't say much about the content of the interview. 
I felt like 
one of the paparazzi as I ran ahead of them as they walked and 
tried to shoot pictures of them. 
Mr. Doyle talked about the history of some of the houses 
along the main road 
in New Lisbon, and he took us back along a 
dirt road to an area that used to be a beach that was popular for 
boating and swimming until the dam was opened and all 
the water 
drained out of the small 
lake they had there. 
The dam was owned 
by a private individual, and he had once expended a lot of money 
in repairs. 
When repairs were needed again, he asked the town to 
help, and they wouldn't, so he just opened the floodgates. 
This 
was apparently about three years ago. 
Mr. Doyle really misses 
the I 
ake . 
I tried to get some pictures of airplanes coming in 
low over 
the trees while we were out. 
This is a graphic way of showing 
the military presence in the region. 
They were tough to shoot--I 
don't know whether the pictures will turn out.

Sue and I went to G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT to visit with the 
Rev. Dr. Richard Ruof and his wife Anne today. 
Before we went to 
Nashville, Mrs. Ruof had called Sue and told her that the wedding 
customs 
in Egg Harbor were really different from any they had 
encountered elsewhere, and she wondered if we would be interested 
in them. 
Of course, we were, and so we made arrangements to 
visit. 
I was on the cameras on this trip, so I don't have any notes 
of my own. 
The Nagra didn't work for some reason, so after we 
had set all the mikes up we still ended up just with pencil and 
paper. 
The Ruofs are very perceptive about the differences in 
the customary practices of the areas they have lived in, and 
it 
was useful for us to hear their impressions. 
As 
it turned out, 
they generally confirmed things we have noticed. 
That felt 
good--to see that we are following the right trails through this 
complex area. 
Rev. Ruof 
is from the Pennsylvania Dutch country, and was 
able to make some comparisons between the practices in that 
region and those here. 
Both are German—settled areas, although 
I'm not sure of the sections of Germany that are represented in 
each place--different locations of origin may account for some of 
the customary differences. 
However, we may have to look further 
for other reasons. 
For instance, Egg Harbor City residents may 
be mostly German, but they rub shoulders often with the Italian 
residents of the Hammonton area. 
There may be some cultural 
borrowing here. 
The wedding receptions here are very important--so important 
that weddings may be scheduled as much as a year in advance so 
the right reception location can be procured. 
If a place like 
the Smithville Inn 
is desired, 
it will 
require early 
reservations, especially, I imagine, during the wedding season. 
Other typical 
locations for receptions might be firehouses or 
American Legion Halls. 
(celebration) 
There is a fairly formal approach to weddings here, 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 116 
including formal introductions and a full meal at the reception, 
which requires grace to be said by the pastor. 
He has never been 
called upon to perform this service 
in other places--he thought 
this might simply be because other places have not had full 
meals. 
I found it interesting to talk with the Ruofs about local 
politics. 
I have spoken with people about it before, and have 
learned that tickets must be balanced in terms of ethnicity--an 
equal number of Italian and German names. 
Rev. Ruof also said 
that it 
is sometimes difficult to get things done because of 
different styles of management of public affairs. 
Italians 
generally use a friendly approach to government--you get to know 
the people you need to work with, and you operate on a personal 
basis--it becomes like asking favors from a friend. 
Germans tend 
to stick to the issues and want discussion. 
I missed much of the discussion as I took pictures, but 
Sue's notes cover that. 
Toward the end, however, I did get to 
ask some questions about gender roles. 
It seems that the women 
are the glue 
in the families around here. 
The nature of men as 
needing to sow wild oats when they are young and then settling 
down with a good woman to hold things together is very accepted 
here. 
Women are the churchgoers. 
We could see this at the Apple 
Festival when we noticed that the pastor was just about the only 
man on the premises. 
The men work all week and want to take the 
weekend off. 
The women, of course, work all week, too, but in 
accordance with the victorian ideal 
(purity, piety, 
submissiveness, and domesticity--"the cult of true womanhood"), 
they also take charge of the religious life and upbringing of the 
family. 
Submissiveness may not be a part of the 
local 
ideal, 
however. 
From what the Ruofs said, 
it 
is very common for 
marriages to be 
like that of George and Helen Zimmer--she is very 
outspoken, active, and articulate, while he 
is quiet, 
in the 
background. 
The active religious role of women, and even more, 
the absence of men 
in religion may be seen 
in the fact that women 
hold the baby at christenings here, unlike the traditional 
practice in other places. 
In addition, women here tend to speak 
their piece in committee meetings and elsewhere. 
In the 
Pennsylvania Dutch country, the men were likely to be explosive 
and outspoken, while the women kept still. 
Not that they didn't 
have opinions and good input, but they didn't see 
it as their 
place to speak up. 
I asked about gender roles in yardscapes and gardening, and 
it 
is the men who take care of the yards here. 
This 
is confirmed 
by a couple of the women we have interviewed, 
like Clara Paolino 
of Ancora. 
However, 
it might be a generational thing--I wonder 
if 
it 
is because they are of a different age that younger women 
like Eileen Homiller take responsibility for the yard except for 
mowing. 
Rev. Ruof had interesting comments to make regarding 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 117 
personal worth and morality--that less feeling of personal worth 
results 
in 
less moral sense. 
The flattening of culture by 
popular influences seems to be undermining personal identity and 
self—worth. 
Rev. Ruof was in favor of preserving cultural and 
ethnic identity, because it helps people to place themselves in 
the world--to identify who they are and hence to build their self 
esteem. The Ruofs' son attends a private Christian school--not 
because it reflects their particular religious beliefs so much as 
that it includes religious instruction at all. 
The public 
schools are becoming aseptic and anemic because of the removal of 
all 
references to religion. 
Religious identity is also part of 
personal self—worth, just as cultural 
identity is. 
So they feel 
that it 
is better for a child to have religious training so he 
will have some concept of who he 
is 
in the world. 
It was most interesting to talk with the Ruofs. 
They are 
sensitive to their surroundings, and very thoughtful about them. 
I really enjoyed our discussion. 
I might add that we sat 
in the "Reed Room" at the church 
(St. John's United Church of Christ). 
I mistakenly thought Reed 
was the name of a person, but the room was so named because it 
was furnished with reed furniture that was manufactured in Egg 
Harbor City. 
There used to be a reed furniture factory there. 
The room apparently serves as a meeting place for the women of 
the church--there was a framed chart on the wall--now I don't 
remember exactly what it was, but I think it was something like 
"The Woman's Creed."

Christine and I visited with the women of the Pinelands 
Garden Club in Medford today. 
G—Medford; 18GT. 
We came at the 
invitation of Mrs. X, one of Christine's contacts, and the 
meeting was held at her home just off Tuckerton Road in Medford. 
At first we thought we were going to be observers at a regular 
meeting, but instead, they held the meeting especially for us, 
and we became the main attraction. 
As 
it turned out, we made it 
into a big group interview, and we had each of them draw a map of 
their own yard. 
The women are upper middle class, and all of them are 
married to professional men. 
Only one of the women--a younger 
one--has a job herself, and hers 
is part—time in her husband's 
company. 
In these families, the women are responsible for the 
garden and yard. 
Only one of them said that her husband is very 
involved in yard decisions and activities. 
The house we met in 
is shingled on the outside and very 
difficult to date--I would imagine 
it was built somewhere between 
1930 and 1960, but I may be way off. 
I think it has been 
remodeled, perhaps several times. 
The living room is 
lower than 
the rest of the house--it was probably added on. 
It has a big 
bay window, outside of which are several bird feeders. 
The 
window looks out onto the cultivated yard with grass and flower 
beds. 
Most of the 6 acres the Wendts own is 
in woods, and left 
alone. 
The cultivated portion and house are on about one acre. 
The house is furnished with beautiful country antiques which Mrs. 
X has refinished herself. 
In every corner is a gem of a piece of 
furniture. 
One bedroom is furnished in spool furniture, 
including a rope bed that they have adapted for box springs and 
mattress, and a trundle under it. This room also contains a pine 
potty—rocker. 
Another bedroom contains a brass bed, a reed 
chair and two wood dressers left from Mr. X's family home. 
The 
house is filled with antique picture frames (rustic), antique 
dolls, and myriad other collectanea, all 
in good order and clean. 
Mr. X is a coverlet fancier, so each bed 
in the house has a 
different interesting woven coverlet. 
Interiors.

I set up the Nagra with two mikes on different sides of the 
room, and tried to conduct the meeting in such a way that only 
one person was talking at a time. 
There are four tapes (PFP83— 
RET25-28), and I will 
leave the details for the tape logs. 
The woman who tended to dominate the meeting was Elizabeth 
Woodford, a local environmental activist and lecturer on the Pine 
Barrens. 
She 
is native to the area--the only one at this meeting 
who was--and is a botanist. 
The club has made her an honorary 
member. 
She and the hostess were the only women there who wore 
slacks besides me, and I thought that she is probably quite 
different from these women who have moved to the area. 
I 
wondered if the honorary membership was a recognition that she 
is 
different from them--and it may have its positive and negative 
ramifications. 
She has a very brusque, lecturing manner. 
The 
women really deferred to her on many questions and kept saying, 
"Oh, you've really got to see Betty's place." 
She 
is 
knowledgable about native plants and has a wild animal refuge. 
She and her husband own 150 acres. 
They put a lot of pressure on 
us to go to her place, and I had to be very discouraging about it 
because of our limited time remaining. 
She seemed a little put 
out by that. 
The women talked about the problems of adapting to gardening 
in the Pine Barrens. 
There are limiting factors they had never 
experienced before: 
shade, sandy soil, high water table, and 
acid pH. 
Many plants they tried to plant in their yards simply 
would not grow. 
As Mrs. X said later while we were walking in 
her yard, "Either you have your natural growth or you have your 
yard. 
I wanted a little bit of both. 
But you have to work for 
what is not natural." 
Part way through the meeting, we stopped for coffee, and the 
refreshments were very good: 
small tea sandwiches with egg or 
ham filling, baked strudels, cranberry bread, cookies, and other 
items. 
There was coffee or tea, served by a woman at each end of 
the table, and a little bowl of mints and one of stuffed green 
olives. 
Apparently all 
the baked goods were homemade--at least 
that was the impression. 
After the food, we returned to the 
living room where I presented a very short slide presentation. 
This encouraged them to talk more about yards and perceptions of 
the area. 
One woman commented that our observations were fairly 
astute, and again I felt good that we were getting some accurate 
information about this region. 
(foodways) 
After the meeting, I walked around the yard with Mrs. X, and 
Christine shot pictures. 
On the one acre that is cultivated, the 
Xs have some fences made of wood. 
More or less as a decorative 
item only, there is a cedar snake fence that they have moved from 
its original 
location surrounding the property--it really 
is no 
longer functional because it falls down so often (I think the 
wood 
is getting soft and rotting), so 
it serves as a backdrop for 
plants and yard art. 
In fact, 
it 
is yard art itself. 
In one 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 120 
location, she has 
it 
in three sections, much like an altarpiece, 
with the two outer sections slightly on a slant inward, and the 
top rails on the outer sections are allowed to just fall to the 
ground at the outer corners. 
Thus it serves as a backdrop for a 
flowerbed containing a tiny pool 
and a ceramic owl 
(unglazed and 
unpainted--she likes her yard art to be "rustic, so it blends 
in.") 
yardscapes. 
All 
of her flower beds are limed--"annuals have to grow in 
sweet soil." 
The lawn 
is dotted with large, fluidly—shaped 
flower beds. 
I asked why she put them where she did, and she 
said that some of the beds were placed where there used to be 
tree stumps that she took out, and she just wanted something to 
be where the stumps were. 
She also has left some stumps in as 
artistic objects. 
The yard was all pasture until about five years ago, because 
they had horses until then. 
So now the yard 
is much larger than 
it was when they moved in 
12 years ago. 
They planted 90% of the 
trees and shrubs that are there now. 
There 
is a hand pump in the 
yard--I am used to seeing them as yard art, but this one works. 
They use 
it to water the garden. 
They've had trouble with deer 
eating azaleas, rhododendrons, lilacs, hen and chicks (a 
succulent), and daisies, among other things, so they have put up 
a high wire fence around their cultivated area, but have left a 
gate into the wooded area. 
They don't mind the deer being there. 
They have also added a string of barbed wire above the top rail 
of their split rail fence that now rings their yard. 
There are 
obviously limits to this nature stuff, even for a person who 
professes a high value for the natural setting. 
(I might add 
that one of the women--Laura--in the meeting stressed her fear of 
fire in choosing a house lot and 
in her landscaping. 
The others 
were less aware of planning for it 
in their landscaping. 
Again, 
nature must be limited.) 
(animal) 
Mrs. X had a pinwheel stuck in the ground in one flower bed, 
and she said that she usually has many around the yard, because 
they are supposed to frighten moles away. 
She wasn't sure that 
they really did any good, but at least she felt like she was 
doing something to curb the problem. 
At one point, I felt the 
ground sort of sink under my feet, and she said that a mole had 
been there. 
She began to follow the track, tamping the earth 
down as she went, so I joined in--partly because it was sort of a 
sensory pleasure to feel the soft earth give way under my feet. 
She said that she sometimes will pour a teaspoon of gasoline down 
the "runway" of a mole. 
That is one remedy that she has tried, 
although, again, she isn't sure that it really works. 
(animal) 
I noticed that all 
the flower beds were lined with bricks 
laid along at a slant, or with rocks. 
I commented on the rocks 
and asked 
if they weren't hard to find 
in the pine barrens. 
She 
said that, 
indeed, they were, and she spent a day 
in the rain 
getting these from the basement of a house that was being 
Thatcher--$3

page 121 
demolished. 
she was allowed in during the times that the workman 
was away hauling debris, and she used a pick and loaded the rocks 
into her truck. 
There was a variety of plants 
in the yard. 
Mahonia--Oregon 
grape holly--it was surrounded by a wire mesh fence to keep their 
St. Bernard from coming up under the bush to scratch his back. 
(Color and black and white frame 30). 
Blue princess holly--bred 
for this region (frame 31). 
Himalayan pine, Burbank plum (makes 
"scrumptious jam," lots of azaleas (but less than she had wanted 
when they moved in--too much sun, not enough mulch). 
Carlesi 
vibernum--a shrub with bright red leaves right now, white 
dogwood, russian olive, ornamental peach, Franklinea (blossoms in 
Sept.), tree peonies ("I have to add wood ashes and lime, and I 
still think I'm not going to win. ") 
Mrs. X has master plan sheets of her gardens, and she has 
tagged the shrubs, so she can identify and locate anything on her 
property. 
She does not grow a food garden, just raises tomatoes--can't 
get anything else to grow. 
There were several swamp magnolias 
that the hummingbirds like to sit in. 
She has a brick patio made 
of broken bricks that she has collected from building sites and 
dumps. 
The yard is decorated at different places with a cider 
press, a cultivator, a wagon, and a rain barrel that she uses as 
a source of water for the plants. 
She commented that the Pine Barrens are really unique 
because all the plants that grow in the south will grow here 
(camellias, for instance), and all 
the plants that grow in the 
north will grow here, too. 
Mrs. X works at Christmastime at Indian Acres, the largest 
Christmas tree farm in the region. 
She does it as a favor to the 
owner, but does get paid. 
She makes wreaths, grave blankets, and 
other decorations. 
The grave blankets consist of greens, pine 
cones, holly, and a plastic bow. 
She doesn't really like grave 
blankets--she considers them gaudy.

This morning Jens and I went to an oyster boat launching 
at the Dorchester Ship Yards G—Dorchester; 38GT. 
The ship, called 
the Robert E. Morgan, 
is owned by Wheaton Enterprises and 
is 
named after the father of the Robert Morgan who now heads, I 
think, the oyster business for Wheaton. 
Jens has worked with 
Morgan and many others in this area and his notes will be more 
complete in terms of what was going on and who everyone was. 
He 
taped the whole ceremony while I took pictures. 
The ceremony was 
scheduled to begin at 10 a.m., but ended up being delayed about a 
half hour because they had to wait for the slack point of high 
tide. 
We arrived in Dorchester at about 8:30, so had some time 
to walk around town and take some pictures of yards and 
buildings. 
The light was very nice at this time, so I hope we 
have some good pictures of these 18th—century—looking streets. 
We also took some pictures of the Dorchester United Methodist 
Church where we taped the hymn sing a few weeks ago. 
When we returned to the shipyard, they were setting up the 
food area where hot dogs, hot chocolate and apple pie were to be 
served. 
The apple pie was catered and served in small paper 
dishes. 
The crust was a little like cardboard. 
This was all 
under the huge open—sided building where the boat was built. 
Now 
the boat was located on the same rigging, but rigging and all had 
been slid over into the ways, or boat launching ramp, for the 
launch. 
People were gathering and talking in small groups, 
eating food and looking over the boat, which was open for 
inspection. 
Martial music (The Stars and Stripes Forever, Off We 
Go Into the Wild Blue Yonder, etc.) was blaring from two speakers 
located on either side of the ramp. 
Jens set up the Nagra, and 
found that he could only have the mike stand, but not the machine 
itself on the platform because everything would go 
into the 
water--the platform and whatever was on 
it. 
Jens simply went and 
got the stand off the platform after the speeches and before the 
launching. 
I tried to get pictures of the crowd--there were quite a few 
old salt types there in short wool plaid jackets or army jackets 
and with nautical caps. 
One or two were smoking corn cob pipes. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 123 
Jens commented that none of the independent oystermen he has 
interviewed were present because they have expressed deep 
resentment at the Wheaton operation. 
They feel that many 
independents have been driven out of business by the big boys. 
Rev. Sooy of the Methodist Church gave the invocation and 
included a plea that the oyster industry might be revived. 
Rita Moonsammy and David Cohen were there with their movie 
crew, and I got a few pictures of them. 
There were also 
reporters and video cameras. 
This was the first oyster boat 
launching in 51 years, so 
it was a big event. 
I found it a difficult event to shoot--I ended up resorting 
to a lot of long shots with a wide angle lens, and I'm not sure 
that is the most effective photography. 
I tend to prefer 
tighter, more detailed pictures. 
I tried a few of those, too, 
using Jens's zoom lens--hoping that I didn't wobble too much. 
I 
was nearly frozen by the end of the event. 
Jens and I both 
dressed up because that is what we had always seen on TV and 
movies--but no one was dressed up except the participants. 
After the boat was afloat, 
it took off down the river for a 
couple of turns. 
There were several people aboard--I don't know 
if they were VIPs or just people who scrambled aboard as the boat 
started to slide down the ramp before the stairs were removed. 
As the boat started to float, the man driving it announced over 
the boat's loudspeaker that free rides would be given to those 
desiring them immediately after the launching. 
They were to meet 
at a dock downriver a few hundred yards. After the announcement, 
the boat's horn blew. Jens and I didn't take advantage of the 
offer of a ride--we were too cold and had to get back to the 
off ice. 
TX02: We headed back through G—Port Elizabeth; 38GT and along Rt. 
548, where Jens has found anti—Herschel Beebe graffiti painted on 
the road's surface, and we found some more graffiti that Jens had 
not seen before. 
The most notable one was 
in two colors--red and 
white, and said (in white), "Deer Bait for Sale" (in red) "Call 
Herschel." 
We tried to speculate on what that might mean. It 
could refer to the poachers' perception that Beebe 
is baiting 
them, or 
it could have to do with the poaching practice of 
setting out bait to attract deer. 
We stopped and photographed 
every graffito we found. 
Most of them were painted across the 
road so that they could be read by a driver coming down the road 
One, however, was parallel to the direction of the road, but it 
was painted at a location where a sand road crossed the paved 
one. 
So there, the graffiti was oriented toward someone coming 
off the sand road. 
On the way back, we saw a sign along Highway 50 announcing 
land for sale, "Not in Pinelands." 
We took a couple of shots of 
it.

TX03: I was bushed by the time we got back home, so I rested for 
a while, then Bonnie and I decided to check out the St. Ann's 
church crafts fair in G—Brown's Mills; 21GT. 
Sue had planned to 
document it, 
but something else came up and she didn't get there. 
Bonnie and I started out planning to just go as regular fair— 
goers, but I said 
if we were going to go at all, we should at 
least take the cameras, so I got them out. 
I discovered, though, 
that I was still tired from this morning and had not set my mind 
to really doing fieldwork at this fair. 
Hence, I missed a lot of 
the things that went on. 
We entered the white clapboard church (Catholic) and 
encountered closed doors. 
We went downstairs and found more 
closed doors, but could hear women's voices coming from behind 
some double doors. 
This was where the fair was. 
The room was 
smoke—filled--many of the women at the tables were smoking. 
It 
was long, 
lined with wood paneling and had a low ceiling with 
fluorescent lights. 
I felt sort of 
like I was in a surrealistic 
setting. 
I did not sense the light—heartedness and community 
that we felt at St. John's United Church of Christ Apple Festival 
in Egg Harbor City. 
There was something of a tired, untrusting 
air about the place. 
We found out who was 
in charge and obtained 
permission to photograph the fair. 
The main woman to whom we 
spoke was Jewel Petry, 24 Pemberton St., Browns Mills (send 
pictures and a brochure explaining our work.). 
She is a past 
president of the Altar and Rosary Society, the sponsors of the 
fair. 
The current president is a woman named Fletch Bossert. 
This 
is the third year of the Christmas bazaar, and all 
the 
items for sale are made by the women in the Altar and Rosary 
Society. 
The Society uses the money for upkeep and operating 
necessities of the altar in the church--chalices, candleholders, 
altarcloths, the priest's vestments, flowers, candles, etc. 
They 
have a workshop group that gets together and makes the items for 
the fair--about 20 members--and other women work at home. 
arts 
and crafts. 
The congregation at St. Ann's 
is growing, according to the 
women. 
There are now 1200 families in the parish, 800 of whom 
are active members. 
Other activities sponsored by the Altar and Rosary Society 
include a communion breakfast held May 1, bus trips (we asked 
twice, but they did not specify what they meant by bus trips--I 
thought perhaps to the casinos or to points of interest), and 
this year an anniversary dinner to which the men were invited--
apparently a unique situation. 
This Christmas Bazaar, however, 
is their biggest fundraiser. 
This year for the first time they 
had a "Living Rosary" event--I don't know whether to call 
it a 
celebration or a service, or what. 
It was sponsored by the Altar 
and Rosary Society, and consisted of people forming a rosary. 
Father Jay Bowden, the parish priest, was the cross. 
Little 
girls were the "Glory be's" and adult women were the "Hail 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 125 
Mary's." 
They lit vigil candles, among other activities. 
They 
did not narrate this 
in a very coherent fashion, so 
it was 
difficult for us to understand exactly what took place. 
This was 
the first Saturday in October, and they want to make it an annual 
event. 
(celebration) 
We met a nun named June Kane who said that she was the 
chaplain at the Hospice in Washington, D.C., and she knows Erica 
Brady--asked us to say hello for her. 
There was a woman who did 
embroidery and needlework to whom Bonnie talked. 
Her husband 
picks the colors for her work. 
Her address is RD 2 Box 105-45, 
Wrightstown, NJ 
08562. 
Food was being served at a counter with a kitchen behind it. 
The posted menu consisted of vegetable beef soup (by the quart, 
bowl or cup), hot dogs, coffee, tea, cupcakes, and brownies. 
(foodways) 
I was going around the room taking pictures while Bonnie 
talked to some people, and I noticed that they had bingo rules 
and signs on the wall--also a sign advertising a harvest square 
dance 
in the middle of November. 
I took pictures of the signs, 
and all 
of a sudden a woman came up and asked if I had gotten 
permission to take pictures. 
I said yes, and she asked from whom 
I had obtained permission. 
I named the women I had talked to, 
and she said, "You're going to have to talk to Father." 
Then 
Jewel came up to me a minute later and said that she had been 
told I was taking pictures of the signs, and now I was going to 
have to talk to Father, because they had only given me permission 
to shoot the crafts fair. 
I apologized, but they said I would 
have to talk to Father Jay. 
Apparently bingo 
is under the 
auspices of the Holy Name Society (the men), and they felt I had 
overstepped their authority to give permission. 
Bingo is 
strictly regulated by the state, too, so perhaps they thought we 
were doing some kind of an expose'. 
Father Jay was busy 
counseling a couple at the moment, and 
in a few minutes he was 
due to hear confessions for an hour. 
We could see ourselves 
cooling our heels for an hour and a half, and offered our phone 
number, and asked for his so we could call him. 
Then Fletch came 
to our rescue and asked if we wanted to see the altar. 
She took 
us upstairs and told us that the building or part of 
it, had been 
an old barracks. 
She showed us the altar with its flags and 
embroidered cloth, and said that the altar cloths are purchased, 
while some of the small 
linen items are made by the women. 
The 
drapes behind the altar are changed to different colors 
seasonally--they were gold today. 
They will 
be white just for a 
few days at Christmas. 
Fletch thought the bingo pictures were much ado about 
nothing, and said that Father would be mad that the women 
bothered him three times while he was counseling. 
She didn't 
think he would mind our picture taking. 
We said we would call 
him--his number is 893-3246--after confession at five o'clock. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 126 
When I did call him, he said there was no problem, and he 
couldn't understand what all 
the fuss was about. 
He offered to 
help us 
in any way that he could 
if we wanted further 
information. 
Other organizations in the church include Boy Scouts, Holy 
Name Society, and a folk music practice group. 
There were many 
others she also rattled off that I missed. 
TX04: On the way home, we photographed a gate along the G—Browns 
Mills—Pemberton Road; 21GT (the mail box had the number 501 on 
it). 
It was a plain metal gate, but a paper monster head with 
giant teeth had been hung above it, I assume for Halloween. 
It 
gave the impression of going into the jaws of a monster as you 
passed through the gate. 
TX05: Along G—New Lisbon Road; 21GT, we came upon a forest ranger 
overseeing a woodcutting project, so we stopped. 
The project is 
the Lebanon State Forest Homeowners Woodcutting Program, and 
it 
involves controlled cutting. 
Here they wanted to cut out some of 
the oak so that the pines could regain the area. 
The men that we 
photographed were part of an extended family--there were a 
father—in—law, brothers—in—law, a nephew, and a son. 
The man we 
promised 
courtesy prints to was Bob Cherry, 1421 Zeppelin 
Avenue, Whiting, NJ 08753. 
He and his family cut a lot of wood 
on these forest service programs and heat their homes with it. 
The forest service here was having them cut the stumps right down 
to the ground. 
They talked for a moment about how hard that can 
be on the saw blades--sand sometimes apparently gets right up 
into the wood of the tree and can really dull 
the blade. 
Bob was 
using a chain saw, cutting a felled tree into about two—foot 
lengths, and his nephew was hauling them to the truck. 
The other 
men were doing the same thing. 
The forest service allows them to 
take a cord of wood.

Today Jens and I went to the G—New Lisbon State School; 27GT 
to photograph their Halloween parade. 
It was quite an event. 
Patients in different units of the school made entries for the 
parade based on themes. 
For instance, one group was all dressed 
as shieks, and they were pulling an oil well 
rig. 
All 
of their 
signs said things like, "Ride, don't walk," "Burn fuel and buy me 
meat," 
"Go ahead and be fuelish." 
There was one entry centered 
around an Atlantic City gambling theme, with the people dressed 
as dice and slot machines. 
Another was a PacMan theme, and so 
forth. 
The thing I found interesting was the names of the various 
units of the school. 
They were all 
named after local 
indigenous 
and introduced plants: 
laurel, dogwood, pine, spruce, oak, 
ivy, 
yucca, and so forth. 
I'd like to get a complete list of these 
names, because they give some indication of which plants are 
popular here. 
I was incredibly tired and burned out today, and as a result 
I shot three rolls of Kodachrome 64 at ASA 200. 
I can't believe 
I did that. 
I'm sending them in anyway and maybe some of the 
brackets will turn out. 
They were all 
of the parade, so are not 
pictures that I can go back and shoot later. 
Jens was shooting 
black and white, so there should be some good ones from his work. 
TX02: 
In the evening, Sue and I went down to G—Elwood; 12GT to have 
dinner with the Putiris and to go to church with Ralph. 
He 
wanted us to meet Joseph Sahl--we wanted to meet him, too. 
He 
has been mentioned to us by several people as being a local 
farmer with deep roots in the Cologne area. 
Before we went to church, the Putiris fixed dinner for us--
rigatoni with homemade sauce, meatballs and sausage, and a 
beautiful salad. 
Apparently all 
the food was prepared by Sal, 
Sr. 
The salad had an amazing array of vegetables in 
it and the 
colors were lovely. 
It was made of 
lettuce, endive, carrots, 
radishes, celery, and probably other things, and served with our 
choice of several bottled dressings. 
They call the tomato sauce 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 128 
for the rigatoni "gravy." 
It took quite a while for them to get 
the dinner ready, and they kept arguing amiably about how the 
gravy should be cooked--on high or low heat, and who should stir 
it. 
I set the table while Ralph tended the rigatoni, and when he 
went to change for church, I tended the food on the stove. 
The 
atmosphere was informal, and we wandered back and forth between 
the kitchen and the living room, sometimes watching the movie, 
sometimes helping or talking in the kitchen. 
The two rooms are 
connected by a wide archway, so they are almost like one room. 
While we were thus engaged, they also turned on the radio to 
a station where they know the man who was doing the disk 
jockeying. This meant that the radio and the TV were on 
simultaneously, and 
it remained so for the rest of the evening. 
They insisted that we pick a song to phone in as a request--Sal, 
Sr. especially insisted. 
It was, I think, a way of being 
hospitable as well as a way of demonstrating part of the family's 
social network and influence. 
Sue asked for "Some Enchanted 
Evening," Sal asked for "Up the Lazy River" by the Mills 
Brothers, and Ralph requested "Old Man River." 
The latter two 
got played, and Sal and Ralph had their names mentioned on the 
radio. 
While we were waiting for dinner to be prepared, Sal showed 
us a set of Rudyard Kipling early editions--1918. 
He also 
brought out a book with a poem in 
it, 
called "A. D. 2000," about 
how people in the future will think of us now when they study us. 
Sue commented that it was perhaps some kind of statement about 
our presence in their lives, and getting the information right. 
He also showed us his high school yearbook--Woodbury High, 1937. 
He was a cheerleader and was 
in the chemistry and drama clubs. 
Sal 
ran out to do an errand, and the rest of us sat down to 
eat dinner so we could get to church on time. 
Ralph read a verse 
of scripture the just opened the Bible and thumbed through 
quickly until he found something to read) and said grace before 
we ate dinner. 
We had a choice of wine, fresh apple cider, soda 
and water to drink. 
Then a family friend named Sally came by to 
cut coupons out of the paper for them as she always does, 
apparently, on Sunday evenings. 
Sally was apparently a close 
friend of Mrs. Putiri, and it appears that she comes to kind of 
help the men out where she can. 
She sat down and joined us 
in 
dinner. 
TX03: The Emmanuel Congregational Church G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT is 
nice, built in 
1911 and recently remodeled and enlarged. 
The 
sanctuary is 
lined with stained glass windows memorializing 
members who paid for them. 
When the building was remodeled, the 
sanctuary was lengthened and a truss had to be added that would 
match the old ones which were curved and had turned decorations 
at the base. 
The people said something about the church having 
been built by boatbuilders, so that is why the roof and trusses 
were shaped the way they were. 
The whole interior of the 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 129 
sanctuary including the trusses and beams is painted white. 
This 
gives the room a very stark, open, and light quality that I quite 
liked. 
Except for the stained glass windows and a large floral 
arrangement in front of the podium, there was almost no color in 
the room. 
The ornamentation was largely architectural. 
Ralph 
mentioned that it 
is a bit of culture shock for him to attend 
Protestant churches with their somewhat stark interiors after 
rated altars. 
We arrived late at the meeting, after the opening song and 
prayer. 
We got in our seats in time to start singing "I Will 
Sing the Wondrous Story," and a woman sitting behind us handed us 
a hymnbook open to the song. 
After the song, the pastor, John E. 
Sahl, Joseph Sahl's son, made several announcements. 
Most of the 
announcements were also printed in the bulletin (see ephemera 
file), but one which was not concerned a food drive for the 
Rescue Mission in Atlantic city. 
The pastor said that this 
church was concentrating on canned goods. 
The hymn singing was accompanied by a man playing the organ 
and a woman on the piano. 
The pastor led the songs by standing 
up and singing and waving his arm in rhythm. 
I'm not sure that 
he had any particular pattern to his waving, as a chorister in my 
church would be taught to have (standard musical conducting 
techniques), and he sometimes stopped moving his arm part way 
through a song. 
Either he felt that we were doing fine without 
the beat, or his arm was tired. 
I know that mine has gotten very 
tired before a lively and long song was over. 
After the announcements, offering and another hymn, there 
was a "Special Selection"--a piano—organ duet performed by a 
brother and sister. 
It was a hymn that built to a rousing finish 
with the organ, played by the girl, just about rattling the 
rafters. 
The sermon was on the beginning of the ministry of Christ, 
and the pastor referred to Bible passages often that the 
congregation looked up 
in their personal Bibles or 
in the Bibles 
that were in 
racks on the backs of the pews next to the hymnals. 
There was less vocal 
response from this audience than I have 
observed in others, although there was some. 
They did not say 
"Amen" at the ends of prayers. 
After the sermon we sang "Pass Me Not," the pastor gave a 
benediction, and everyone began to mill around and talk 
in the 
sanctuary. 
We were introduced to Bob Peterson (365-1678), the 
headmaster of the Pilgrim Academy, which is the school 
run by the 
church. 
It is the same school to which Rev. Ruof of St. John's 
United Church of Christ sends his son. 
Bob writes a monthly 
column for the Egg Harbor News on the history of the town. 
He 
talked to us about the town and some of the old buildings. 
He 
was talking about the Germans who settled the area, and I thought 
to ask if there were any German bands. 
It was something that I 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 130 
hadn't bothered to ask up to this point for some reason. 
He told 
us there was the Weekstown German Band (contact: Harry Jensen) 
G—Weekstown; 12GT G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT, which was named for 
Weekstown but was really mostly made up of people from Egg 
Harbor. 
He said that he had a postcard of them at his house next 
door, so he ran over to get it. (See my ephemera file.) 
When he 
returned, he also had a handful of historic photographs and 
papers that he showed us. 
I regret to say that I did not take 
notes on what he had specifically--mostly old buildings, the old 
Egg Harbor City arch over the White Horse Pike, and the like. 
He 
showed us photos of the Goodwill Hook and Ladder Fire Company--so 
named because they bought their fire truck used from a company of 
that name, and they didn't want to spend the money to have it 
repainted. 
Bob offered to be of whatever assistance he could. 
He was friendly and seemed fairly knowledgable about the past of 
the town. 
He 
is working on a book. 
Bob, somewhere along the way 
in 
the conversation commented that German farmers always plant 
something on St. Patrick's Day. 
Even if 
it 
is too cold for most 
things, they will plant some kind of early crop on that day. 
In 
the confusion of having so many people around, I did not have the 
chance to follow up on that comment. 
He also said that car— 
playing is a popular activity in this area--pinochle. 
We also met Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sahl (965-2929), who are 
very active members of the church with an evangelical bent. 
They 
asked us what our church membership was, and Sue told them that I 
was a Mormon and she was a "lapsed" Mormon. 
They are the potato 
farmers who have a Biblical verse painted on their barn--"The 
earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof." 
It would be a 
good photograph, but I think a visit to their place would have to 
be a long one, and we don't have the time this trip. 
We told 
them that we were running out of time, but said there might be a 
chance that we or someone will 
be returning in the spring, and 
they may be contacted. 
They seemed affable and willing to help. 
On the way out of the church, we all commented on how beautiful 
Mrs. Sahl 
is. 
She looks like she 
is 
in her sixties, but she has 
lovely white hair in 
loose curls on top of her head, and she 
is 
small and slender. 
She has aged beautifully, as Ralph said. 
After church, Ralph asked 
if we would like to see the 
Moravian and Catholic churches in Egg Harbor, and he drove us to 
them. 
Not directly, however. 
He was not very familiar with the 
town, so we wandered a bit in trying to locate the churches. 
He 
knew the general vicinity, but couldn't pinpoint the exact 
location. 
He pulled into the parking lot of a bar called the 
Liberty Beer Garden that attracted Sue's and my attention because 
of 
its name, and Ralph said, "Why don't one of you go 
in and ask 
directions." 
We laughed, because this surprised us--we didn't 
like the idea of walking as women alone into a strange bar. 
We 
asked 
if he would do 
it instead, so he did. 
He came out and 
said, "It's kinda cute 
in there--you should've come in." 
We then 
located the two churches, which are very nice. 
They were pretty 
at night with lights focused on them. 
I'm not sure why Ralph 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 131 
wanted to show us the two churches except for the fact that the 
Moravian church had been mentioned in our conversation with Bob 
Peterson, and he had some pictures of 
it 
in earlier days. 
The 
Catholic church was more of an afterthought, probably because 
Ralph had been there before, and 
it relates to his upbringing. 
There is a convent and a parsonage (is that the right word?) 
adjacent to the church itself. 
While we were groping our way around the Egg Harbor City 
streets, we asked Ralph if he hadn't hung out in the area when he 
was a teenager. 
The Egg Harbor—Hammonton area seems connected 
enough that teenagers would freely travel between the two towns. 
He said that he didn't do much of that because first, he lived 
out in Elwood where he was fairly isolated from other kids, and 
second, he didn't have a car. 
Sue thought this latter statement 
was funny when juxtaposed against the fact that Ralph was driving 
us around 
in a very elegant and large car with automatic locks on 
the doors among other things. 
Times seem to have changed for 
him. 
I don't know if the car is his own or 
if he shares it with 
his father or brother. 
As we drove back to Elwood along the White Horse Pike, we 
talked about the farm markets and how their numbers have dwindled 
in recent years. 
He was able to point out to us several former 
markets that had been owned by members of his family. 
The 
market—turned—garage that I noticed early on 
in this project used 
to belong to a family member. 
He also pointed out a Noritake 
store where I have stopped before, and said that it 
is 
run by a 
Ravelli that married a Messina. 
The Messina family is a family 
of glass blowers and cutters, and Ralph indicated that they still 
do 
it, now with the son—in—law operating the business. 
While at the church, I had asked Bob Peterson if his family 
buys grave blankets at Christmas time, and he said, "Oh,sure." 
It was assumed that you do it. 
I wondered if the fact that he 
is 
of Swedish and German ancestry would make any difference in the 
practice, but evidently not. 
He went on to talk about the Egg 
Harbor City cemetery, where graves are laid out in a pattern 
reflecting the settlement patterns of the city. 
The Germans, who 
came first, are 
in the center. 
The Italians came next, and they 
form the next ring of graves. 
The final ring 
is a mixture of 
ethnicity, because people of differing backgrounds have been 
moving in since the Italian settlement. 
Bob commented that 
"Cultural diversity is what made America great." 
He also told us 
about pointed clay decorations that are 
in the cemetery which 
people used to paint every year and used to decorate graves. 
Now 
they are not refurbished every year, and there are apparently 
piles of them in or near the cemetery. 
TX04: We arrived at the Putiri home and found Sal, Jr. and his 
girlfriend, Linda Goff, sitting on the couch and Sal, Sr. sitting 
in an easy chair in the living room. 
G—Elwood; 12GT. 
They were 
watching a movie on TV. 
Ralph had shampooed the rugs that day, 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 132 
and they were still damp. 
(I might add that there was no 
evidence of worry about dampness from the rug ruining the 
furniture--my mother won't move the furniture back into the room 
for several hours, and then only 
if all 
the legs have pieces of 
foil under them to protect them from moisture.) 
We sat down and 
chatted a little about nothing in particular and watched TV while 
Sally cut out coupons in the kitchen. 
We were tired, and after 
staying a while, we said that we would leave now. 
This brought 
protests that we hadn't had dessert yet (it was postponed from 
before church for lack of time). 
So we stayed, and after a 
little further talk, the icebox cake made by Sal was brought out 
of the fridge. 
This was a special occasion dessert--he had gone 
to some trouble to prepare it. 
It was 
in a 13x9 Pyrex pan, and 
consisted of a bottom layer of crushed graham crackers, then 
chocolate pudding, a layer of sliced bananas, more crushed graham 
crackers, vanilla pudding, and a layer ("so you don't get fat") 
of "Lite" fruit cocktail. 
This was dished out into bowls and 
topped with real whipped cream from a pressurized can--a lot of 
it, 
the way Ralph applied it. 
(foodways) 
We asked if Mrs. Putiri had taught them all 
to cook, and did 
they use her recipes, and they said that she never wrote a recipe 
down--they were all 
in her head. 
Sal, Sr. was the one that knew 
her recipes best. 
While we sat eating dessert, Sal 
said, "Oh, 
it's too bad you 
girls aren't going to be here for Christmas Eve. 
We really have 
a feast then." 
Then he described the fish dinner that they have 
on Christmas Eve--all kinds of fish--shrimp, smelts, all kinds of 
other seafood. 
Then they go to Midnight Mass. 
Ralph, 
in spite 
of his Protestant conversion, also attends this Mass. 
He 
likes 
it, 
and the Protestant services are all 
early 
in the evening or 
on Christmas morning. 
When they return from Midnight Mass, they 
come home to sausage frying (or they did when Mrs. Putiri was 
living--I don't know what they'll do this year). 
They eat a 
breakfast, and then go to bed for a while. 
They open their gifts 
on Christmas morning. 
Linda, Sal Jr's girlfriend, 
is of German 
and Irish descent, and her family also opens gifts on Christmas 
morning. (celebration) 
We talked a little about the woods walk we have been 
planning, and Ralph said that there are wild dogs and bobcats in 
the woods--he has been chased by wild dogs once. 
He thought it 
might be a good idea to carry a gun 
in the woods. 
Linda asked us 
if we had heard about the Jersey Devil, and 
we said yes we had, and I told about the picture I had seen that 
some people believe to be a picture of the Jersey Devil during a 
forest fire. 
(See my notes on my visit with George Heinrichs.) 
Linda said that she wouldn't go out to Leed's Point--it bothered 
her. 
I asked what they thought the Jersey Devil might be, 
and 
Ralph allowed that it might be a masquerading demon. 
He said he 
believes in demons, and this might be one. 
No one at the table 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 133 
said they didn't believe in the Jersey Devil. 
Ralph then said 
that he had heard a demon once. 
Sal Jr. concurred. 
About 
fifteen years ago (they would have been about 16 years old), they 
had gone to bed 
in their room, and 
it was apparently late night. 
While lying in their beds, they heard a sound something like 
chewing and gnashing which seemed to approach their window from 
out of the woods. 
The sound got louder and louder, until 
it was 
very loud--"like a hundred decibels," said Ralph, then it slowly 
receded. 
Both boys were scared and didn't dare to 
look out the 
window. 
Ralph says he's glad to this day that he didn't look 
out. 
He hinted that if 
he had looked, something terrible might 
have happened. 
Linda then told about a boy who was upset about breaking up 
with his girlfriend. 
This apparently happened in her 
neighborhood or near someone she knows. 
The boy went to the 
girl's house and hanged himself in the front yard. 
He was 
discovered by his own mother, who then let out a blood—curdling 
scream that people still talk about. 
Sal Sr. then brought up a story of relatives who went to 
Florida six months after the death of an uncle Paul. 
It had been 
the family's practice for many years to go to Florida in the 
winter. 
These relatives took a picture of a scene, and when the 
film came back, there was uncle Paul 
in the middle of the 
picture. 
Ralph then came up with the story of three female relatives 
who came home one night and saw their dead grandfather sitting 
in 
a chair in the living room reading the newspaper. 
They all held 
hands and went into the kitchen, and when they looked into the 
living room again, he was gone. 
Ralph continued with an 
account that his mother had told him (his father had never heard 
it) about when she was 
in bed one night and saw a figure enter 
the room. 
She thought it was one of the boys, but then decided 
that it was too short. 
She turned to awaken Sal, and the figure 
disappeared. 
We were given another request on the radio when we came back 
from church. 
Again, Sal 
insisted that we pick a song we wanted 
to hear. 
We chose "Some Enchanted Evening" again 
since it 
didn't get played the first time. 
Ralph called his friend and 
asked for the song to be played for his friends Sue and Ellen (he 
has a hard time remembering my name). 
When the D.J. finally 
played a song, 
it was "'Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows' for 
Ralph out in Elwood and his girlfriend Sue Ellen." 
I don't know 
if 
it was all a misunderstanding, or if Ralph was playing a joke, 
or what. 
The Putiris do a lot of good—natured teasing and insulting 
of one another. 
The boys were teasing Sal about his girlfriends. 
Sal 
said, "Yeah, women all want my body." 
Sally said that even 
before Sal's wife Emma died, she told her that there were always 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 134 
women attracted to Sal. 
During the whole time the radio and TV were on at the same 
time. 
Once, during the conversation, when the radio seemed 
particularly intrusive, Sal 
asked for it to be turned down. 
Sally protested that she was listening to it. 
She spoke of the 
D.J. and the program as 
if 
it was something very personal--almost 
as 
if the D.J. was a relative, which he might have been. 
At one point in the evening, I asked Ralph a little more 
about the grave blankets, and he said that they take about 4-5 
minutes to make (I think this 
is actually a log, not a whole 
blanket) and about 15 minutes to decorate. 
They will make 1000 
and sell them both wholesale and retail. 
They dip laurel and 
other greens into aluminum paint to make it silver for the 
blankets.

TX01: (Written 11/11) We are reeling from the tragic death of 
Christine Cartwright a few nights ago. 
I have found myself 
unable to throw myself into my work again the way that I did. 
I 
am full 
of fears--of walking along the road, of the possibility 
of forest fire (today is a windy day, but it rained yesterday)--I 
am suddenly feeling incredibly vulnerable. 
I hear a siren and I 
panic, or the phone rings and my heart sinks. 
I'm sure all this 
is just temporary, but getting through it 
is horrible. 
I begin 
to get depressed toward evening. 
I think all 
of us are reacting 
in much the same way--others have spoken their fears, and they 
are much the same as mine. 
Religious faith for me has not 
obliterated my fear of sudden, violent death, although I find 
that I find comfort when I pray. 
At times it 
is the only peace I 
have. 
I had not cried since the accident, but last night I did. 
I was talking with Nora in the kitchen, and the tears began to 
flow. 
Nora knew what to do--she just stayed there, did not talk, 
and gave me a back rub while I sat in the chair. 
I don't know if 
I was crying for Christine or for me or for all 
of us and our 
fears. 
Probably a little of each. 
At any rate, I'm having a 
very hard time working as hard as I was before. 
I just don't 
have the heart for it now. 
TX02: Yesterday morning (11/10/83) Sue and I went to G—Lower Bank; 
26GT to visit with Eileen Homiller again. 
She is really 
something. 
I enjoy talking to her, she 
is such a positive 
person. 
The plan today was to take a walk in the woods with her, 
map her yard, and find out some place names in the area. 
We had 
to forego the walk because the weather was threatening, and I 
wanted to be sure and get the yard mapped. 
As it was, we went 
until noon and got rained out of the yard. 
I mapped it but did 
not measure it. 
We also sat 
in the kitchen and went over a topo 
map and had Eileen identify local places and their names. 
It was 
a very enjoyable and fruitful session. 
I used the cassette 
machine so we could be mobile--the lavalier indoors and the radio 
mike outdoors. 
Eileen planted most of the shrubs in their yard. 
When they 
moved into the house, 
it was almost entirely bare of greenery. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 136 
Now she has all 
kinds of flowering trees and shrubs. 
There are 
two pits behind their place where gravel was removed for the 
road. 
One used to be filled with water and they used it for a 
small boat for the kids and swimming. 
Now the water has all 
drained out--she attributes that to the drought. 
Her house 
is cramped, but pleasant. 
Full of decorations 
made of natural materials, and warm colors. 
Some of the things 
we noticed around the house included a flat box full 
of 
cranberries sitting on a high chair and ceramic wall decorations 
such as a blue rooster and a plaque that says "Give thanks unto 
the Lord." 
See the tape logs (PFP83—AET003 and 004) for further details 
of this interview.

Sue and I visited the Zimmers again for one last time. 
Circumstances have drastically reduced the amount of work I 
planned to do 
in the last two weeks, and I felt some urgency to 
do some woods walks and yard maps. 
Unfortunately, we couldn't 
break up these tasks into smaller time blocks, and I ended up 
making no measured drawings of yards. 
They are all eyeballed and 
rough sketches. 
I hope to have time to transfer them onto larger 
pieces of paper in a more orderly fashion. 
The first order of business with the Zimmers was to take a 
walk through their woods--about five acres--part of her family's 
farm on which she grew up. 
The day was dreary and rainy, unlike 
the day last week when we had had the activity originally 
scheduled. 
That day was the day after Christine's death, and we 
of course cancelled all 
commitments. 
We bundled up and set out on the trail, moving out of the 
planted and planned yard into a zone of semi—wildness where the 
doghouse and a pumphouse, among other things, were located. 
That 
zone merged into woods with an easily—visible trail which we 
followed. 
The Zimmers's dog, Cricket (beagle, I think), followed 
us for a short distance, and then took off into the woods, 
apparently looking for a rabbit to chase. 
Within a few minutes, 
Mr. Zimmer noted that the distant baying indicated that Cricket 
had found what he wanted. 
Throughout the rest of our walk, we 
periodically could hear the dog, and Mr. Zimmer would comment on 
it. 
At one point, Mr. Zimmer thought from the sound that the dog 
had gotten onto the track of a deer. (animal) 
As we walked, 
it became apparent that Mrs. Zimmer knew and 
loved the plants in the woods, while Mr. Zimmer related to the 
animal 
life. 
She pointed out various species of plants, 
including teaberries (she periodically picked a few and handed 
them to us to eat), 
laurel, sphagnum moss, and others; while he 
noted tracks of raccoons, deer, and rabbits. 
I wondered why this 
division of interests existed. 
Is 
it simply a manifestation of 
personal 
interests, or 
is 
it more cultural? 
I think the latter 
is the case. 
Men hunt animals. 
Mr. Zimmer said that he hunts 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 138 
rabbits alone with his dog, but he hunts deer with a group of 
local men--not a gunning club. 
He has to understand animal 
habits in order to hunt them, and he needs to be able to identify 
tracks and how old they are. 
At one point in our walk, he 
pointed out some deer tracks, and said that the deer must have 
heard us coming and turned and run. 
The tracks were that fresh, 
and he could see where the animal had wheeled around. 
Mrs. 
Zimmer displayed a more detailed knowledge of plant names and 
uses. 
While Mr. Zimmer knew many of the plants, he did not take 
the lead 
in the conversation on the subject. 
He knew, of course, 
that we had asked his wife for a walk, and I think he saw himself 
as being peripheral to the main interest we had. 
However, his 
behavior seemed to follow the line of thinking that Reverend Ruof 
had mentioned: 
the women around this area are the movers, and 
the men tend to stay somewhat in the background. 
Mr. Zimmer let 
his wife lead the walk, even when at one point she began to 
lead 
us 
into a fairly wet portion of the swamp. 
Before we turned into 
it, 
he just said, "Are you sure you want to go that way? 
It's 
pretty wet down there." 
But she continued in that direction, and 
we all followed. 
It truly did prove to be pretty wet--it was a 
slightly harrowing experience walking on slippery logs through a 
mucky area. 
I was glad Nora had loaned me her rubber boots. 
Why are plants in the realm of women and animals in the 
realm of men? 
Animals are closer to our own species. 
They can 
also be more unpredictable in behavior. 
They may be aggressive, 
reclusive, affectionate or dangerous. 
Plants, 
if they are not 
well understood and known by species, can also be dangerous. 
It 
is necessary for Italian and Polish women in the woods to know 
which mushrooms are edible and which are poisonous. 
Mrs. Zimmer 
does not use many of the woodland plants for food. 
She really 
only uses wild blueberries and teaberries, as far as I could 
tell. 
And the teaberries are more of a "fun" kind of food--not a 
staple or something that comprises part of the daily diet of the 
Zimmers. 
Plants are not aggressively dangerous. 
Animals can be. 
In 
many cultures hunting animals is male work, often requiring a 
great deal 
of strength, depending on the animal being hunted and 
the type of processing it requires, while gathering is female 
work. 
It seems that this pattern continues in the pines--at 
least for the Zimmers. 
The Zimmers refer to the whole lower area below their house 
as the "swamp," but really, only certain areas are really wet. 
There was a cedar swamp where they collect sphagnum moss, 
although the moss grew sporadically throughout the lowlands. 
The Zimmers really know this tract of 
land. 
They were able 
to guide us through brush and trees, and knew exactly where they 
were. 
I was totally lost. 
Mrs. Zimmer collected samples of many 
of the plants growing on the land for us. 
She knew exactly where 
every species grew. 
One thing that she made a differentiation 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes

kc 
on, and on which I am not at all clear after talking to other 
people about it, was that princess pine and crow's foot are two 
different kinds of plants. 
Both grow low to the ground, but the 
princess pine consists of tiny vertical shoots that look very 
much like miniature pine trees with little buds at the peak. 
They were about six inches high, and I don't know if 
they were 
connected by a continuous root system. 
Crow's foot grows in more 
of a rope fashion, and the configuration of 
leaves or needles 
indicates that the name is appropriate. 
It grows in 
long 
clusters low to the ground. 
Before we left, Mrs. Zimmer made a 
little Christmas decoration for Sue out of a stalk of princess 
pine, some ribbon and a candy cane. 
cognitive maps, (plant). 
We returned to the house, and Mrs. Zimmer prepared a 
delicious but unpretentious lunch of ham boiled with cloves and 
glazed with tomato jelly, potato salad, macaroni salad, a sliced 
tomato, and some of the sauerkraut that she was making the last 
time we visited. 
For dessert, she made "doughnuts" or fastnacht. 
She made the dough using the rendered chicken fat she showed us 
on our last visit. 
The dough was flavored with nutmeg and orange 
rind--it had a wonderfully subtle flavor. 
After lunch, 
in pouring rain (this proved to be the case for 
every yard map I made), I started working on the yard map. 
The 
thing I noticed the most about their yard was the large number of 
bird feeders and houses. 
There was also a separation of areas in 
ard--food production was centered in the garden at the front 
r of the 
lot, and the rest of the landscaping was mostly 
ative. 
There was a pair of sassafras stumps 
in the back 
that were about five feet high, and they were used as 
ng racks for a number of tools and implements used 
in the 
They flanked a pump, and one of the items I recall hanging 
one of the stumps was a water dipper. 
The practical— 
etic opposition is something to be pursued in the study of 
capes.

as a food resource and landscape accordingly? 
I find it 
interesting that the Zimmers' food garden is 
in front of the 
house. 
This may be because the soil there is better for 
vegetable production, or 
it may have to do with preferring the 
aesthetic presence of birds and flowers in the private area of 
the back yard. 
Why use all 
that public space 
in the front yard 
for aesthetic purposes when it 
is not as acceptable for private 
enjoyment? 
There is still plenty of space in front for aesthetic 
presentations. 
The garden may also be a source of pride, and so 
displaying it 
in a public area invites admiration. 
It has 
aesthetic elements of 
its own. 
In fact, Mr. Zimmer pointed out 
to me that there was a small tree planted in the middle of the 
garden. 
I don't recall what kind of tree it was, but it was not 
a food—producing tree. 
There are also flowers planted in the 
garden. 
After going through the yard with the Zimmers and 
Thatcher--83

identifying all 
the plants and items there, we prepared to take 
our leave. 
They have been very kind to us, and 
it 
is always hard 
to say goodbye to people like that. 
She sent us packing with a 
bag full 
of plant samples, a few doughnuts, and a grapevine 
wreath with a bunch of sea lavender for each of us.

Today I drove down to visit the Putiris, planning to take 
a woods walk and measure their yard. 
G—Elwood; 12GT. 
Naturally, 
it was raining--pouring. 
I decided to go anyway, hoping to get 
at least some of the work done. 
Our appointment was for ten 
o'clock 
in the morning. 
I arrived, knocked at the door, and Sal, 
Sr. answered the door and announced that anyone wishing to cross 
the threshold had to give him a kiss. 
I obliged him with a quick 
greeting and entered the house. 
Ralph wasn't up yet, thinking I 
probably wouldn't come on this dreary day. 
I sat 
in the kitchen 
with the two Sals and talked about a number of things, including 
Italian naming customs. 
The oldest son 
is to be named after the 
paternal grandfather, and the next son 
is to be named after the 
maternal grandfather. 
Sal, Jr., then, 
is the older of the twins, 
and Ralph 
is the younger, and 
is named after his mother's father. 
We sat around and just shot the breeze for quite a while, and 
Ralph's cousin Ralph Fichetola stopped by (both second sons, both 
named after the same grandfather). 
He was an expansive sort, and 
immediately began talking about himself. 
He was apparently 
written up 
in the Atlantic City Press last year for his knowledge 
of traditional skills. 
He does his own butchering and curing of 
meat, along with other food processing and production. 
He 
proclaimed himself the longest—elected Democrat in Mullica 
Township, to which Sal, Sr. objected, saying he had been in 
office longer that Ralph F. 
(Sal 
is a councilman and Ralph is a 
freeholder.) 
Ralph retorted that he was adding up all 
the years 
he had held public office, not only counting the consecutive 
years of service. 
His total years amounted to something like 
sixteen, I believe. 
His reason for coming by was not clear--
perhaps some township or family business. 
He and Sal 
later 
walked out together. 
Another drop—in was the Egg Harbor City police chief. 
His 
business was not brought up 
in my presence, either, but he talked 
a little about the interesting cemeteries in the area. 
(Sal 
had 
introduced me as someone interested in the history and old 
cemeteries of the area.) 
The chief told me that on the "far" 
side of Egg Harbor Lake, there are some graves of a family that 
was killed by Indians. 
He also mentioned the glass on the graves 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 142 
in 
the Egg Harbor City cemetery, and said that most of the EHC 
cemetery is 
located in Mullica Township, while the newest part is 
within the boundaries of EHC. 
While Ralph was getting ready, I sketched the yard 
in the 
rain, 
leaving the names off to be filled in 
later by Ralph. 
Sal 
Sr. also took me over to the small greenhouse on the other side 
of the stand, where Ralph's cousin Claude (they call him 
"Claudie") was making bases for the grave blankets. 
He took a 
piece of wood (cedar scrap), stapled chicken wire to 
it so that 
it formed a tube lying on the wood, and then stuffed sphagnum 
moss into the chicken wire tube. 
The moss being used was 
collected last year and was brown, but they had kept it moist all 
year. 
They said they would have to go out and collect some more, 
as this would not be enough for the season. 
It was just surplus 
from the previous year. 
They hadn't purchased greens yet, and so 
they could only work on bases at this point. 
arts and crafts, 
(plant). 
In addition to the blanket bases, they made log bases. 
These were rough boxes made of cedar scrap with the ends of the 
wood on two opposite sides extending well beyond the corners of 
the box. 
A piece of styrofoam (green) was shoved tightly into 
the box as a base into which greens could be stuck. 
These came 
in two sizes, one larger for use mostly on graves, and a smaller 
size to be used on mantles or tables indoors. 
The work operation 
was set up 
in the greenhouse for the first time this year. 
In 
previous years, they have worked in the small studio apartment in 
the building behind the stand (actually, the building is the 
stand). 
Sal told me that they are renting this small apartment 
to a young man now. 
I would never have known it, because they 
used 
it for pumpkin—painting headquarters and canning 
headquarters during the summer and fall. 
(When I told them that 
I would like living 
in Hammonton or Lower Bank if I came back for 
another phase of fieldwork, they offered me this studio 
apartment. 
It wouldn't be a bad place at that, except for the 
way they have been using it for the work mentioned above. 
Might 
be a privacy problem.) 
Ralph took me out behind their place to find the Amato) 
ruins they had mentioned to us before. 
We drove along Moss Mill 
Road, back and forth probably five or six times, driving slowly 
along the shoulder of the road. 
Ralph said that he knew that he 
could see a particular wall from the road, but we had a hard time 
finding it. 
Finally we found a couple of cement ruins close to 
the road, but they were not what he wanted to show me. 
We then 
located the entrance to the state police offices, and drove east 
a mile. 
This was where Ralph was sure the ruins were. 
We parked 
the car and he began to wander around while I put on Nora's 
boots. 
It turned out that we were 
in the right place, but the 
wall 
in question was much further off the road than Ralph 
remembered. 
Around it was a series of foundations and 
unidentifiable remains of the old munitions plant. 
It was 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 143 
raining too much to take pictures, so I hoped that Thursday, when 
we were planning to go on a picture—taking expedition, would be 
better for photography. 
Ralph said that he 
liked to walk through 
these woods, but didn't do 
it too much--maybe a few times a year. 
Before we went back to the car, he said, "Come here, I want to 
show you this big track I found." 
I thought, "Gee, what big 
animals do they have 
in these woods?" 
He then led me to a pit 
that was about fifteen feet in diameter and said, "Isn't that 
some track?" 
I had been taken in. 
There was an old rusty and 
wheel—less wheelbarrow lying by the pit, and I guessed that the 
hole had been dug by someone needing a large quantity of sand. 
Ralph then offered to buy me lunch, and I said, "Oh, 
let me 
buy 
it for you." 
I've always felt that we owe these people so 
much for letting us 
into their lives the way they do. 
But Ralph 
called me a chauvinist, and I relented. 
We returned to the house 
to find a coupon for one of the local restaurants, and he took me 
to the Ponderosa for lunch. 
While we ate, Ralph quizzed me a little about my religion. 
It had come out early in our friendship that I was Mormon, and he 
is born—again Christian. 
He said that he still had a hard time 
understanding any religion that claims to be the only true one. 
I said that I thought that was understandable--it does sound a 
little smug. 
The conversation was friendly and did not dwell 
long on that subject. 
We turned-to the yard map I had made, and 
he 
identified all 
the plants on 
it. 
The yard is apparently his 
baby, and he knows every inch of 
it. 
He has planted 
rhododendrons and dogwoods alternately all 
around the perimeter 
of the yard where it meets the woods. 
Rhododendrons are all over 
the place in the landscape. 
He has placed a bird bath over the 
lid to the cesspool, a large urn—shaped planter over the grave of 
one of his dogs, Fanny I. 
Another dog, Fanny II, 
is also buried 
in the yard, but there is just a flat brick marker over her 
grave. 
(animal), yardscapes. 
After lunch, we returned to the house and Ralph took me 
into 
the woods behind the stand to show me the deer pile they have 
there. 
Apparently there are two deer piles (piles of apples, 
pumpkins, and vegetables to attract deer) in those woods, but he 
couldn't find one of them. 
The law states that you can have a 
deer pile, but no closer than 90 feet or 90 yards (I don't know 
which) to a stand, or shooting location. 
Before we went out into 
the woods, Sal Sr. expressed concern that we would get lost 
because it was a cloudy day. 
Ralph 
is obviously not extremely 
familiar with the woods, because he was not able to pick a direct 
path through them the way the Zimmers could the day before. 
He 
does not know the names of plants, and has a fairly vague 
knowledge of the animals that live there. 
Finally, after spending almost the whole day there, I took 
my leave. 
It seems that whenever we visit with the Putiris a 
short visit always stretches into a long one. 
They are so 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 144 
hospitable and funny that it 
is a pleasure to be with them. 
They 
do not seem to resent the intrusion into their lives, but I do 
feel guilty for taking up so much of their time when they have a 
lot of work to do. 
Ralph had a large order of undecorated grave 
blankets to get out, but when I mentioned it, 
he said not to 
worry, so I didn't. 
I was able to postpone saying goodbye to the Putiris a 
little longer because they said they would be 
in production on 
grave blankets on Thursday, so I told them that we would come by 
on our photography tour that day and take a few pictures. 
In the 
evening Jens and I drove into Philadelphia to pick up Sue from 
the train from Washington. 
She had gone there to find an 
apartment.

Today was Sue's and my day for going out and taking 
pictures of all 
the places we needed to fill 
in gaps 
in our work. 
Carl Fleischhauer was here to begin wrap—up, and he came with us 
to photograph the Putiri's grave blanket operation. 
Ralph had 
asked us to arrive by 9 a.m. so that he could get on with his 
day's work of making a large quantity of blankets. 
We planned to 
stay for about an hour, as we, too, had miles to go before we 
slept. 
Well, the one—hour visit expanded into an all—day one 
again, but a productive and enjoyable one. 
Carl followed us to 
G—Elwood; 12GT in the van so that he could be free to 
leave when he 
needed to. 
When we arrived, we were not surprised to find that Ralph 
was 
in the shower--that was his location many times when we came 
to the house, and one of the Sals always entertains us. 
We sat 
down around the kitchen table, and they offered us instant 
coffee--regular or decaf--and breakfast cake (their term). 
This 
phase of our visit stretched into an hour or more, and Sal Sr. 
began telling stories. 
Carl 
ran out to the car and quickly set 
up the Nagra, so we got some of the stuff on tape. 
Sal 
reiterated some of his information about Italian naming customs, 
telling about various family members who would not speak to each 
other when the traditional naming pattern was not followed. 
He 
also talked about foodways in his family, and told of some 
cousins who made cornmeal (polenta?) mush and would pour it out 
directly onto the table until 
it covered the whole table top and 
was a half inch thick. 
Then each family member would mark out a 
portion 
in front of him or her and eat it. 
He talked about 
trapping animals for food. 
While we sat there, a cousin named Charlie came in. 
The 
Putiri's house 
is a real crossroads--every time I have been 
there, someone has dropped in. 
Charlie was there directly from 
his night shift work at a bakery to work on grave blankets. 
He 
is really a construction worker, but has not been able to find 
work, so has been doing other things. 
He always helps with the 
grave blankets. 
Later in the day when we went out to the 
greenhouse to observe the operation, he told Ralph that he was 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 146 
working very fast and had gotten seven blankets out of one bundle 
of greens. 
Ralph said that was good. 
TX02: After sitting around the table for some time, we decided to 
head out to take pictures of G—Amatol; 12GT. 
This time we were 
able to drive directly to the place, and Carl shot some pictures. 
The place 
is 
important because it appears to be so 
important to 
the Putiris. 
It was one of the primary things they wanted us to 
see. 
It 
is directly behind their land, and 
is all 
in woods, but 
once housed or employed 25,000 people. 
Ralph made a point of 
showing Carl and Sue the huge "track" he had showed me on 
Tuesday--really a sand pit. 
On the way to Amatol he asked us to 
stop by the post office so he could check the mail. 
Then he 
showed us the old post office building around the corner from the 
current one. 
TX03: When we came back, we went out to the greenhouse to watch 
the grave blankets being made. 
G—Elwood; 12GT. 
Sal Sr. 
demonstrated the making of a log--one of the large ones. 
He put 
greens into the styrofoam and cedar base, and then decorated it 
with ruscus (sp?), plastic poinsettias, deer, and a gold plastic 
"Merry Christmas" sign. 
As Ralph watched his father make the 
log, the interaction between them became somewhat funny as Ralph 
would criticize how his father was doing it. 
He didn't like the 
fact that the ruscus was not as tall as the greens on the side, 
and he thought that there was too much stuff around the base. 
Sal 
kept saying that this was just a quick demonstration of how 
this 
is done, and this one might not be entirely up to their 
usual aesthetic standard. 
Most of this interchange is on tape 
(probably PFP83—RET030 or PFP83—RET031). 
Their family friend 
Sally, whom we met the Sunday that we went to church with Ralph, 
is supposed to be the best blanket and 
log decorator that they 
have. 
Ralph justified some of his criticisms of his father's log 
by saying that Sally wouldn't do 
it that way. 
arts and crafts, 
plants. 
TX04: Eventually the subject of lunch came up--it was nearly one 
o'clock. 
The Putiris wanted us to go to the Columbia II 
restaurant--Ralph had tried to take me there on Tuesday, but it 
is closed on Tuesdays G—Hammonton; 11GT. 
It 
is 
run by a family 
friend, Dominic Amendolia, who 
is a mushroom gatherer. 
We tried 
to get Sal Sr. to come with us, but he was afraid that there 
would be no one to watch the store 
if he 
left. 
He arranged 
something, though, because we weren't long at the restaurant 
before he showed up. 
Dominic came and sat with us for a while 
and chatted. 
He said that he really likes to hunt, but he hasn't 
"even looked at" his gun this season. 
It was his deer pile that 
Ralph couldn't find behind the stand on Tuesday. 
Ralph took this 
opportunity to ask where it was, and Dominic said that it was "on 
the ridge by the pine tree with the pegs driven in 
it." 
Ralph 
said he knew where that was. 
Deer season is the second week in 
December. 
Dominic said that he was a member of the Never There 
Deer Club. 
Cognitive maps. 
Thatcher--83 
Fieldnotes 
page 147 
Dominic had plenty to say about the Pinelands Commission. 
He felt that older people are the ones that are most adversely 
affected by the rules. Sal joined in the discussion and said, 
"They took away what we could do with the land, but they didn't 
lower our taxes any." 
Dominic felt that the White Horse Pike 
should have been zoned commercial. 
He said that our knowledge is 
incomplete and contradictory 
to what we once knew. 
For instance, "the politicians said to 
bury our trash. 
Now we have to spend billions to move those 
pits. They said that what we learned in school when we were kids 
about water purifying itself 
in the sandy soil was wrong. 
It's 
just throwing good money after bad." 
Sal said that home rule is 
slowly disappearing. 
"We voted them in, though." 
Sal continued, 
"I sit on the council and hear it every day." 
People have a half 
acre of 
land, and they can't do anything with it because of the 
Pinelands restrictions, so they default on the taxes and let the 
land revert to the township. 
That makes the tax burden on the 
township higher. 
In addition, he feels that as Atlantic City 
grows, the people there have no place to go because they can't 
move into the Pinelands area.

TX05: After lunch we returned to the house where Carl took some 
pictures of the yard and we met Uncle Tom Caucci. 
G—Elwood; 12GT. 
He 
is another relative who dropped by the house. 
He 
is somewhere 
around sixty years old and is one of the children from the family 
that poured corn meal mush on the table. He owns a farm market 
closer to Atlantic City and when the holidays approach, he puts 
in a supply of wine and gives a drink to all who ask. 
He talked 
a little and described the mush experience. 
This whole family is 
great for stories and interesting interactions.

left, and Ralph went with Sue and me to take a picture 
of the Sahl's barn with the verse of scripture on 
it G—Cologne;

We got out there and the Sahls weren't home, but Ralph was 
sure that it would be all 
right if we took the picture, so Sue 
shot it. 
Again, 
it was pouring rain. 
Then Ralph showed us the 
place where his family collects sphagnum moss, but he didn't want 
us to divulge its location. 
Most people like to keep their 
favorite collecting places to themselves. 
Ralph then offered to buy us each a raspberry ice cream 
cone, so we stopped at a custard stand next to one of the first 
farm markets we visited, Harry's. G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT 
Then we 
drove back to the Putiri place and bade farewell to the whole 
family, getting kisses from them all, even Uncle Tom.

TX01: 
Sue and I took the weekend and drove up to New Jersey to 
take one last shot at measuring Mrs. Zimmer's yard and to just 
visit with our favorite informants once more before I go back out 
west. 
We stayed with Rita Moonsammy in Mt. Laurel, and spend 
Saturday in Egg Harbor City and Hammonton. 
We went first to the Zimmers' place G—Devonshire; 12GT G—Egg 
Harbor City; 12GT after getting slightly lost -- we found we 
didn't know the area as well 
as we thought we did. 
We arrived at 
about eleven o'clock, and, after exchanging greetings and giving 
the Zimmers a framed paper cut design from the gift shop at the 
Library, we set about the task of measuring. 
The job 
is similar 
to that of measuring a building, 
in that all 
the parts must come 
together on paper to make a coherent whole. 
Undoubtedly I have 
forgotten to measure some vital part -- I usually do -- but I 
won't know until I draw measured plans. 
I'm sure I will 
learn 
some things about measuring yards for future use. 
I'm not sure 
if anyone has tried this approach before. 
Mr. Z. accompanied us at first while we measured, and he 
pointed out animals and plants in the yard. 
He saw a gray 
squirrel sitting in a tree, and chuckled to see how it sat with 
its tail over its back -- "That's the way they sit when it 
rains." 
There were a couple of cat birds -- "They're going to 
build 
in this big bush with the stickers." 
Later we learned that 
cat birds like to be around people when one came and sat on a 
branch a short distance from us and sang, and Mrs. Zimmer 
responded by talking to the bird. 
(animal) 
Mr. Z. told us to come and smell the blossoms on the 
viburnum bush. 
Later Mrs. Z. did the same thing. 
The blossoms 
are small and white, growing in bunches. 
The ground was covered 
with moss in one location, and Mr. Z. 
blames acid rain for the 
way moss is taking over in some spots. 
Mrs. Z. scoffed at that 
idea. 
We said it 
looked pretty, and Mr. Z. allowed that it 
didn't have to be mowed. 
In the back portion of the back yard, 
Mr. Z. pointed out a blue jay sitting on a nest in the crotch of 
a tree. 
Thatcher--84 
Fieldnotes 
page 149 
We 
looked at the garden, which is situated in the north 
front corner of their yard, and I asked why they located it 
there. 
Mrs. Z. 
said that it was the area that they got cleared 
first. 
There was no emphasis on better soil or anything. 
I 
asked if they ever have things stolen from the garden, and she 
said not usually. 
Occasionally someone will come and take 
something. 
Mr. Zimmer had already planted some things in the 
garden: 
3 weeks ago he planted spinach and lettuce, and on April 
1 he planted onions. 
All 
of the plants were coming up and looked 
nice. 
The front of their garden 
is 
lined with bulb flowers, and 
they complained that many of the bulbs were destroyed by 
"pine 
mice." 
These are small mice with short tails, and they run 
in 
the tunnels created by moles or groundhogs. 
The mice are 
apparently responsible for a lot of damage to plants. 
There is a 
large rhododendron bush by the north end of their house that has 
leaves and large flower buds on it, but the leaves have all 
drooped severely and 
it 
is apparently dead now, probably due to 
pine mice eating the roots. 
Under the irrigation pipe, which is mounted up high down the 
center of the garden plot, Mrs. Z. has planted flowers, dill, and 
parsley. 
Rhubarb also grows under the pipe. 
At the back of the 
garden they have raspberries. 
Mr. Zimmer had to go to an elders' meeting at St. John's 
United Church of Christ in Egg Harbor City, so we stopped part 
way through the measuring to eat lunch before he 
left. 
Mrs. 
Zimmer had prepared cream of asparagus soup that was delicious. 
We also had rolls and a coffee cake made from her chicken—fat 
yeast dough. 
For dessert there was freshly—stewed rhubarb. 
I 
drank water and the others had iced tea with the meal. Mrs. 
Zimmer showed us the crock that last fall had sauerkraut aging in 
it (or it may have been a different crock -- one crock looks like 
another); this spring it held dandelion wine which was fermenting 
with raisins floating on top. 
A piece of cheesecloth draped over 
the top of the crock kept dust and foreign objects from getting 
into the wine. 
(foodways) 
While we ate, we paid sporadic attention to the birds that 
came to the feeder outside the window. 
We noticed a titmouse and 
a blue jay (both identified by Mr. Z.) 
The Zimmers commented 
that they try to scare squirrels out of the feeder by flipping 
towels and making sudden gestures at them through the glass, but 
the squirrels aren't frightened until someone goes and opens the 
back door further down the hall that runs along the back of the 
house. 
We discussed grave decorating after we told them that we had 
driven past the cemetery and noted the flowers there. 
They said 
that people put flowers on graves starting at Easter, then again 
at Memorial Day. 
Then they may put some on again 
in the fall, 
then they do grave blankets in the winter. 
Mrs. Z. said that on 
Thatcher--84 
Fieldnotes 
page 150 
Decoration Day (Memorial Day) you meet all kinds of old friends 
that you haven't seen for at least a year or more, because 
everyone comes to decorate their family graves. 
"It becomes one 
big socialization." 
The Zimmers make their own grave blankets. 
They "don't like 
anything artificial." 
Mr. Z. makes one big one for their son 
Tommy's grave, and Mrs. Z. makes others (four this past year) for 
other family members' graves. 
Mr. Z. 
likes to make his before 
deer season starts so that isn't interrupted. 
He gets a board, 
piles sphagnum on 
it, and lashes it with a string. 
Then he adds 
the evergreen boughs and decorations. 
Mrs. Z. uses a styrofoam 
base instead of sphagnum. 
They decorate the blankets with alexia 
holly spray painted red, huckleberry painted white, and pine 
cones painted red or white. 
The Zimmers think of the practice of making and placing 
grave blankets as a recent one, but it goes back at least to the 
1950s when their son Tommy died, because a friend made a big one 
for them then. 
Mrs. Z. thinks the practice came out of the 
celebrations of Decoration Day. 
Mrs. Zimmer told a story about a 
Chinese person who was asked why the Chinese put food on the 
graves of their dead. 
The answer was that it 
is the same as 
"your people" putting flowers on the graves so the dead can come 
and smell them." 
They said that Memorial Day 
is a big holiday in EHC, and 
they have a parade, a gun salute at the cemetery and other 
ceremonies on that day. 
They don't do anything on the Fourth of 
July. 
(celebration) 
We returned to the yard and finished the measuring, having 
some trouble 
in the area around the chicken pens and woodpiles. 
Those places were very congested with plants and other materials, 
and 
it was difficult to get an 
idea of the shapes of things. 
After we finished measuring, we took photographs of the yard with 
its spring foliage and flowers. 
I shot color in my camera and 
Sue shot black and white with one of the center's cameras. 
Mrs. 
Zimmer had some slices of tree trunk -- birch, I think, drying on 
the overturned boat near their shed. 
Mr. Zimmer had been cutting 
the tree up for fire wood and when Mrs. Z. 
saw the interesting 
shape of the trunk, she asked him to slice it up so she could use 
the pieces for crafts projects. 
She gave each of us a piece and 
suggested that we could use them as trivets. 
(plant) 
Mrs. Z. suggested that we walk back into the woods a short 
distance so we could see what spring was like there. 
We went 
down and saw huckleberry blossoms, fiddlehead fern (also called 
cinnamon fern by Mrs. Z.) sprouts, and other spring flora. 
She 
also pointed out the seed pods (we used to call them 
"propellers") of the native red maple or swamp maple. (See photo 
logs.) 
I tried to shoot some more "these are the Pine Barrens" 
pictures while we were 
in the woods. 
Mrs. Z. gave us each a 
Thatcher--84 
Fieldnotes 
page 151 
small twig of sassafras to chew, telling us to eat the leaf, 
bud, twig, and all. 
I think I prefer mine with cream and sugar. 
On the walk back toward the house, Mrs. Z. picked up a large dry 
stick. 
I asked her what it was for, and she said she would use 
it 
in the wood stove 
in the kitchen. 
"Never take a walk that you 
don't bring something back, so you don't waste your time." 
She 
also cautioned us about ticks and told us to check for them when 
we got home. 
Later, 
in the house, she found one walking on my 
trouser leg. 
Thankfully, I found no others that day. 
(plant), 
(animal) 
We 
learned in the course of our visit that the dog, Cricket, 
had died on March 4 of heart worms. 
Mr. Z's voice cracked when 
he told us about it. 
Mrs. Z. said they would have no more dogs. 
I think Mr. Z. might have liked to get one, because he loves to 
hunt, and he seems to love animals in general. 
TX02: 
After leaving the Zimmers, we went to a custard stand east 
of G—Egg Harbor City; 05GT on the White Horse Pike and got cones. 
Then we headed up to G—Batsto; 26GT, which I had never had an 
opportunity to visit before. 
There were people flying kites on 
the meadows around the park, and the parking lot was more than 
half full. 
However, 
it was getting toward the end of the day, 
and we missed the gift shop, the mansion tour, and any live 
interpretation that took place. 
I was a little disappointed in 
the interpretation, feeling that I did not come away educated 
about the 
iron industry 
in the Pines. 
I also felt that the 
crafts in the cottages (there were three open -- the decoy maker, 
the potter, and the chair caner) -- had little to do with what 
Batsto was. 
For what my opinion is worth, I think crafts should 
be 
limited to a couple of festivals out on the green, and the 
cottages should be devoted to interpretation of the lives of bog 
iron workers. 
TX03: 
We then moved on to G—Elwood; 12GT to visit with the 
Putiris. 
On our way there, as we drove down the Elwood—Pleasant 
Mills road, we spotted a hand—painted sign 
in front of a house 
that said "NO DUMP ON AMATOL." 
I got out to take pictures of 
it, 
and a woman on a bicycle rode by and yelled, "Yeah, take pictures 
of 
it so we can get rid of it!" 
My 
immediate thought was that 
she was pro—dump and wanted to get rid of the sign, but now I 
wonder if she didn't mean that she wanted to get rid of the dump. 
When we asked Ralph about it, 
he said that Atlantic County wants 
to put a 750—acre land fill on the site that is Amatol, the WWI 
munitions plant which I have mentioned before in my notes. 
Ralph 
said that most everyone is against the dump -- out of a 
population of 4000 people, 700 showed up at a town meeting to 
shout down anyone who tried to speak in favor of the dump. 
The 
Putiris, of course, are against it -- part of Amatol 
is 
on their 
land. 
I think that Ralph's college training in environmental 
science could be a factor in his thought on the subject, too. 
However, he also mentioned that the Pinelands Commission has come 
up with a new law that requires the getting of a permit to cut 
Thatcher--84 
Fieldnotes 
page 152 
any tree on your property. 
The Putiris, who have used the trees 
on their land for firewood (not a lot -- they probably burn one 
tree a year), are upset about the rule. 
government, conservation 
It was fun to see the Putiris again, and we immediately 
became involved 
in the organized chaos that exists there. 
We 
took pictures of the stand with bedding plants spread out in 
front, then we started hauling plants around to help out. 
A 
truckload of new plants had just come in, and room had to be made 
for them. 
We moved azaleas and small painted wood donkey carts 
designed for holding flowers in a yard. 
When the gnats got too 
fierce, Ralph called a halt and we all went inside the house. (I 
suggested we put on some insect repellent, and Ralph said he 
would rather have the gnats.) 
I asked Ralph if he was still trying to sell the stand, and 
he said that maybe 
if someone wanted to buy 
it, 
he would sell 
it, 
but he was enjoying it more this year, and he 
liked being his own 
boss. 
I think after his mother's death last year, 
it was hard 
for him and his father and brother to face running the place 
without her. 
He said that he needs more help now. 
Sal 
Jr. has a 
job selling insurance, and Ralph said his father was no help at 
all -- just talked to people all 
day. 
(Ralph also mentioned 
later how he [Ralph] "hibernated" during late winter, and how bad 
a time he had during March. 
We suggested that such a depression 
could be an anniversary reaction to his mother's death.) 
Bruno and Anna Marino, old family friends now living in 
southwestern Virginia, had arrived for a visit earlier in the 
day. 
Anna told us that she became friends with the Putiris when 
she was living 
in the area (she is from Hammonton) and she bought 
a bad melon from Emma's. 
She took it back, and Josephine 
(Ralph's mother) was very nice about replacing it, 
and they 
became fast friends. 
This was Anna's first visit since before 
Josephine's death (March, 1983). 
Anna, who 
is 
in bad health with diabetes and an enlarged 
heart, took things over in the kitchen, preparing asparagus and 
fresh strawberries for supper. 
She planned to make an asparagus 
omelet with boiled buttered asparagus on the side, and strawberry 
shortcake for dessert. 
The asparagus and strawberries were from 
the stand. 
She also decided to clean out the refrigerator. 
While Sue and I visited with her, we got a strongly stated 
description of what a good woman should be: 
able to cook and 
clean, and help her husband in his business. 
This was 
in 
reference to the kinds of wives Ralph and Sal 
Jr. needed. 
(Was 
this directed at us as potential candidates?) 
The laundry had 
been taken from the dryer earlier and piled on the sofa under 
Anna's direction, and while we sat around the table and listened 
to her rail against Sal's girlfriend, Linda, for not doing what a 
woman should do (i.e., clean a room every week, fold the laundry, 
and cook a good meal once 
in a while), we guiltily got up and 
began to fold the laundry. 
Anna said she would do more 
if 
her 
Thatcher--84 
Fieldnotes 
page 153 
health allowed. 
Then she and I cleaned out the refrigerator, 
throwing away those items that looked spoiled and choosing others 
to augment our dinner fare. They had had a birthday party for 
Sal, Sr. 
last week and there were some goodies such as shrimp 
mousse in the fridge that were good. 
(foodways), women 
While all 
of this was going on, Ralph was back outside at 
the stand, helping customers and preparing to close for the 
night. 
They don't close until dark, so during daylight savings 
time, they are open quite late. 
Sal Jr. 
left to go to a party 
with his employers, an 
insurance firm. 
Sal Sr. decided to take 
the two stand employees home and stop at the grocery store to buy 
some things for dinner. 
After being gone what seemed like a very 
long time, he returned with some sliced ham and other items. 
We 
heated the ham in the microwave and the regular oven and finally 
sat down to dinner around 9:30 pm. 
In the meantime, Bruno, who 
had been sleeping in the living room all this time, awoke and 
decided he would have some food with us after all, contrary to 
his earlier stated preference, so Anna got out some Spanish 
olives for him. 
There was also some garlic bread and sliced 
tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes, and celery. 
(Bruno just had five 
bypasses done on his heart a month ago, and he drove the whole 
distance from Virginia today.) 
It was a very eclectic meal. 
Then for dessert we had strawberry shortcake consisting of 
poundcake from the store, fresh strawberries without sugar, 
vanilla ice cream, and real whipped cream. 
Ralph had insisted on 
the last item, not wanting to settle for cream from a can for 
company. 
(foodways) 
While we were eating, Joe Colacci (sp?) came 
in. 
He 
is one 
of the men who participated in the hog butchering Sue documented 
last December, and he is now doing some construction work for the 
Putiris, putting walls on the ends of the fruit stand so the wind 
doesn't whistle through. 
He apparently has some kind of desk job 
in the daytime. 
Joe had a little of the blackberry brandy Ralph 
offered him, but he has just lost some weight, and he valiantly 
turned down all other offers of food and drink while he stood 
there. 
He said that he had cut down on a lot of things, but he 
still 
liked to have his daily Twinkie. 
He stood quietly much of 
the time while we all sat around the table, except for an 
occasional remark or wisecrack: 
"Hey Ralph, did you know that 
every time your elbow bends, your mouth opens?" 
Joe recently had 
all 
of his upper teeth pulled, and 
is apparently waiting for a 
plate to be made. 
It was not noticeable. 
He talked briefly about 
his 12 year old son, "the apple of my eye," whom Sue met at the 
butchering. 
The boy 
is dyslexic, but has been getting help and 
is doing very well now. 
Joe inquired of Sue about the courtesy prints she promised 
to send him after the butchering. 
She pled not guilty -- she had 
sent them to Ralph to be passed on to Joe. 
After some rummaging, 
Ralph found them and Joe was very pleased with the quality of the 
pictures. 
Thatcher--84

page 154 
At one point during dinner, I asked Anna where her family 
had come from in Italy, and she said, "Sicily -- where the mafia 
is." 
Sal's family also comes from Sicily, and they all 
launched 
into some good—natured joking about mafia connections. 
We had promised Anna that we would do the dishes, but it 
began to get late, and Ralph insisted that we get on our way, so 
we took our leave around 10:15. 
Ralph had been telling us all 
evening that he had something for us before we left, so when we 
got outside, he brought us each a pot of forget—me—nots and a 
small strawberry pot with hen—and—chicks plants in 
it. 
In 
addition, he gave us a gallon of apple cider to share. 
It took about 40 minutes to get back to Mt. Laurel.
