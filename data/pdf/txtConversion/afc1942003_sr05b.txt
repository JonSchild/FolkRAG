"Dear Mr. President", Austin, Texas, January or February 1942
AFS 6402B
John T. Kahn, Jr.: I'm John T. Kahn, Jr., 1511 Drake Avenue. Dear Mr. President, I've been in a position
to observe the south Austin people and my observation tends to lead to the opinion that they're
all behind you. However, I don't believe that the civilian defense work has been advertised enough,
because the people don't seem to realize the importance of civilian defense. I'm in the position to
know because I'm one of the registrars and the registration has been very slack. If there's some way
to advertise this civilian defense a little bit more, I think the people would get behind that and start
registering faster.
Ed Brodie: Mr. Roosevelt, I am Ed Brodie, a farmer and stockman southwest of Austin. This farm
community is behind your policy and leadership one hundred percent. It seems the farm labor
problem will be our biggest worry, being unable to pay wages that they can get in other fields. I'm
farming a hundred and fifty acres and I'm ready to produce whatever we are called upon to raise in
this farm belt. I think you have done more for the farmers in the South than any president we ever
had.
What do you think? [said to interviewer]
