INTERVIEW LOG 
 
 
Interview with Juan Salcido Sanchez Palm Meadows Training Facility Boynton Beach, FL Ellen 
McHale, Ph.D.  
 
00 – Juan Salcido Sanchez is a groom for Kieran McLaughlin. He likes the job and considers it 
an exciting job. He likes to train horses. He has been working as a groom for 13 years, started in 
2000. His first job was with James Bond in New York.  
 
00:56 His father was working for Bond and his father helped him get a job. Juan's father started 
out as a groom for James Bond and then was a foreman for Nick Zito. Juan's father is now retired 
and back in Mexico--Guadalajara.  
 
1:36 Juan Salcido is from a small town and the horses were the main way for people to travel 20 
years ago. He’s been around horses all his life. Juan’s father received a visa for him and got him 
into the US. His father taught him the job. Juan Salcido started out as a hotwalker but only did 
that for four-five days when some people left to go back to Mexico and there was an opening for 
a groom. He says that he got lucky.  
 
2:50 The job of a groom is to keep the horses in good shape: clean the stalls, give the horses a 
bath, grooming, take care of their legs. Make the horses look good. If they see something wrong 
– like a cut – the groom contacts the assistant trainer or foreman and he tells them what to do, 
what kind of medicine. Juan takes care of four horses which is a nice number – not too much 
work. Kieran McLaughlin has 120 horses total but in Florida there are 60 horses. The rest are in 
New York. There are 20-25 grooms. He gets a day off every week. Kieran, Niall, and Trish 
McLaughlin are all good people. He has worked for them for 7 years.  
 
4:36 Juan gets paid by the hour, $10.50/hour. Overtime is about $15.00/hour. He works about 48 
hours a week. He gets a day off every week. It is a good job.

5:15 If he has a horse in a race he goes to the track with the horse and gets the horse ready for the 
race and they get extra money for that. If a horse goes someplace, they travel with the horses: to 
Gulfstream, to Tampa, to California – wherever the horse goes to race. When a horse is good, 
they can go all around the country.  
 
5:58 He has two horses from one owner, and two for different owners. Most of McLaughlin's 
horses are from one trainer – Darley. He is one of the biggest farms in the world and has horses 
all over the world. They are based in Kentucky and then are sent all over the world. The owner is 
Sheikh Mohammed. [HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum ]  
 
7:11 If a horse wins, the grooms get a 1% bonus. If the horse wins a $100,000 race, they get a 
$600 bonus. If the horse wins a couple of million, the groom could get $25,000.00.  
 
7:52 Juan comes to Florida for five months in the winter season. Then they go back to Saratoga. 
They have a private barn, the Green Tree, in Saratoga.  
 
8:50 Juan has a 9-month visa. This year he had an extension. This time he will stay here. The 
boss (trainer) does all of the visa filing. Juan says that he likes Saratoga the best. He gets sent all 
over and he likes Saratoga the best. The place where they live - a private barn and house – is 
private and quiet. It is nice to work there. It is like a big family. The private barn is off the main 
track, the Green Tree is behind the main track, off of Nelson Avenue. The place is newly built 
two years ago. The Green Tree has their own one-mile poly track. To get to the main track they 
walk through the barns behind the main track. The owner is the Darley farm.  
 
12:40 Juan has worked for McLaughlin for 7 years. He would like to be a foreman. It is a hard 
job because it involves working with people and horses. A foreman is involved with the 
personnel. If something happens with the horse, or if the workers have problems, they go to the 
foreman. In Florida there are two foremen for sixty horses. As a groom you only worry about 
your four horses. A foreman is responsible for everything in a barn. The hierarchy is hotwalker, 
groom, foreman, assistant trainer, and trainer.  
 
15:00 Kieran McLaughlin started as a hotwalker and now he is a trainer. If you have always 
worked at the top you don't really know the heart of the job. Mclaughlin knows how difficult it is 
to be a groom and therefore understands how hard the job of a groom is.  
 
16:10 In McLaughlins barn, a horse could be there two or three months, or could be there a full 
year. It depends on the condition of the horses or the conditions of the races. If a horse is sound 
and doing well, the horse could stay 2 or 3 years. Juan says it isn't easy. The horses are more 
wild the more purebred. He gets kicked and bitten.

17:50 He usually grooms just fillies. He does have favorite horses. Juan likes the more wild 
horses because he has more to teach them and when they change their attitudes, he feels most 
happy.  
 
18:40 Somebody told him that when he begins to feel towards the horses like they are like his 
kids, then you are a good groom. He spends a lot of time here. He has a family and 3 kids in 
Mexico and sometime he misses them. He can get the money here that he won't get in Mexico 
and do things here that he can't do in Mexico.  
 
19:56 The Assistant Trainer that helped his father, also helped Juan.  
 
20:10 Even though you are used to horses, these horses are different. (Speaks about the horse he 
is working with now.) 
 
21:00 In the past 13 years, the basic job is the same. Now it is a little easier. The work day used 
to be 3:30 a.m. – 11:00-11:30 a.m. and now they start at 5:00 a.m. and finish at 11:00 a.m. The 
difference is in the trainers. The job is the same but some trainers do things different than each 
other. He talks about how some trainers use ice and some don't. The hours have changed. He 
says that the State is getting more involved and that is making a positive difference. The lodging 
and the pay are better, with help from New York State. In New York, they have free medical 
care and food – good benefits.  
 
23:35 Every year, Juan assists people to come into the job. Last year, he brought in two of his 
brothers. He tells them, "Don't be afraid of the horses. The horses know what you are going to be 
doing. They are not bad animals." Most horses are nice. Juan tries to teach them how to work 
with the horses, step-by-step. That is the first thing to teach them.  
 
25:00 Juan says, "The first day, when I start to work with the horses, my father, he never told me 
nothing. He got a bad horse. He was a tough horse to work with. He was very wild. My father, he 
don't tell me nothing. He just tell me, ‘Hey, go inside the stall and take the bandage off the back 
horse.' So I don't know the horse. I don't feel afraid. I go straight to the stall and took off the 
bandages. The horse, he don't do anything to me. He was very quiet. Then when I came out, my 
father tell me, 'That horse was the baddest horse in the barn. He bite a couple of guys. He kick a 
couple of guys. You wasn't scared? No. Why? Because you don't know.' So that is the way you 
have to do the things. Don't be scared.' Now, he tell me then. ‘Now, go in and do the same thing. 
And I say ‘No.' You see? He tried to teach me. You know, you see? Sometimes the people don't 
even know the horses and they are very scared. So that is why I tried to teach them little guys. 
You know. Don't be scared. The horses are not going to do nothing. My father is a good man too. 
He has a good way to teach the things, you know."

26:24 The horses are very sensitive about everything. And sometimes the horse is like playing 
with you. He is like try to scaring you. He is like, ‘OK, I'm going to do this thing and try to see 
the reaction of this guy. And if you get scared, the horse is going to do that again and again and 
again. Because he knows that he is bigger than you and he knows that he can bite you, that he 
can kick you. And he knows that you are afraid of him. So they are very sensitive. So, if the 
horse tries to kick you and you don't get scared and you show yourself and say something and 
things like that - the horse learns. And the horse, he understands and 'Ok, this guy is more smart 
than you, and then he calms down. He is a very sensitive animal. Especially the fillies are more 
sensitive - like the women. [laughs]… The colts are more stronger and sometimes they don't 
listen. You can have a big, strong hand with the horses, with the colts, and they don't listen. They 
are like a man. You know. 'OK, no, no, no, I'm going to do this on my way. And they never 
understand. And the fillies, no. The fillies are more sensitive and they learn more things more 
easily. There is a big difference. Sometimes it looks like all the same but each horse is different. 
It's just like the people.  
 
28:12 He talks about the filly he's working with.  
 
28:35 He brought his brothers to work for the same trainer – four brothers working for the same 
trainer. Juan talks about the fine character of Kieran McLaughlin and his siblings. Juan says he 
could stay another 7-10 years easily. It's good pay. Grooms talk about trainers and compare 
them. He says that many of the people he works with now were once working with the same 
trainer, Nick Zito. The job was harder there. He talks about how the grooms compare the 
trainers. Juan tries to get his friends to work near him and it helps the job be easier. Juan talks 
about the longevity of the grooms with McLaughlin.  
 
31:45 He says that the grooms from Mexico are from 3 states: Pachoca, Michoacan, Jalisco. 
Some grooms are from Guatemala. Juan is from Jalisco. The says that his place is known for 
Mariachi and Tequila.  
 
32:33 Juan will be going back in November. He came last May . His last visa was May to 
November and then he got an extension to April and will get another extension until November. 
When he goes home, he takes a 3-4 month vacation.  
 
33:27 He has a fear about going back-and-forth because you never know if you will get a visa 
again. They try to work by the rules and not get in trouble. For thirteen years he has always 
gotten the visa in time. But that is a concern that he might not get a visa next time. And he loves 
the job and the pay. He has been able to have a house, and car. He tries to do the right things, but 
some of his friends didn't get the visa one year. If you extend the visa, than you don't have to 
worry. If he goes home every nine months, he is going to spend a lot of money for the flight. If 
he stays here, it is easier to save money. He misses his family and it's not easy.

36:15 Juan is 31 years old. 13 years ago he was 18 – when he started working in the US. He says 
it was good to come then. He was a teenager and enjoyed everything. Now he tries to save 
money. When they go back to their country they feel free and have a lot of money. It's part of the 
life. Then he gets married and gets mature and he has to change. He says he loses friends. They 
are friends in Mexico and then they come here and they have money and they get involved with 
drugs and alcohol. It is easy to get all the things. They lose their head.  
 
38:37 Juan says it depends on the family. His father taught him the good way – how to be a nice 
man.  
 
39:00 He says: This job has everything. It's easy. It's hard. And you can get excited. It's very 
passionate. But at the same time you can lose everything if you don't have the brain to do the 
right things. You can lose everything.  
 
39:35 Juan is the oldest son. He has 8 siblings. There were six boys and three girls in his family. 
He went to high school. He came to the US because his father was working hard and there wasn't 
enough money. It is hard to get a job in Mexico. His sister works in a bank as a cashier.  
 
41:14 I don't feel bad about it. I am happy to be here. I am happy to do this job I really like. I feel 
happy with the horses all the time. That is why I do this job. I really like it.   
 
41:52 Juan talks about betting. He says that people lose the money they make. He says you have 
to work hard and then you lose the money all in one day. He never bets on the horses.  
 
42:39 The biggest race hes won is the Florida Derby in 2005. And he took a couple of horses to 
the Breeders Cup. He's been in some good places. Last year was his first year in California. He 
liked California.  
 
44:19 I like this thing, this interview: "I'm very excited because nobody asking me nothing about 
the horses before. Nobody knows the real job with the horses. Mostly all the people, they just 
came to watch the horses in the races. And they don't know all the things that are behind. We 
have to work a lot to get a horse in the race. Sometimes you got two to three months working to 
get the horse to the race and he gets sick the last day and you lose everything. That makes me 
feel bad. I really like this because now the people is going to be more interested about it. Too 
many things, a lot of things behind the race and the more important things are behind the race. 
The race is more than these things because it is just two minutes, and that's all. I always say, 
when somebody asking me, 'How do you feel about the horse in the race? Are you going to win?' 
And I always say, ‘The only thing that I need to win the race is two minutes of lucky and first 
God. That's all I need.' But to get there is many things behind. A lot of jobs. A lot of pressure 
5 
 
sometimes. And its nice and I like these kind of things. I like that the people are interested in the 
things that we do. I like that.

Second File: [transcription]  
 
00 But that's true That's a true thing. You know Every time when you see the Racing Form or 
anything –about news of the horses. They always talk about the horse, about the trainer, the 
scores, about the owner, but they never mention, 'Oh, this is the groom that take [sic] care of this 
horse.' When the horse wins the big race - like the Kentucky Derby - they never talk about the 
groom or about the hot walker. Sometimes about the riders. But they never talk about us, you 
know. It's just the trainer, the owner, the jockey, and that's all. But, its just like I'm saying. To get 
to that point we go through a lot. We do many things. And it's a lot of people: the hot walkers, 
the foreman, the grooms, and the vet , and the blacksmith. It's a lot of people behind the race. It's 
not just win a race and that's all. No. And they never mention nothing [sic] about us, you know. 
And sometimes we can feel bad about it, because in the end, it's my job. It's my job. Sometimes I 
don't get any credit, but its my job. And the horse gets there because I did a good job. Because I 
keep him safe, you know. I keep the horse ready to get there. And we don't get any credit about 
it. We feel bad, but we understand. On the end I'm just a groom and if I don't come, somebody 
else is going to come to cover my job. We understand that. But, anyway, I think that we are 
important. You know. I think that to win a big race is because everybody is doing a big job. I 
think and this like that, you know. Usually I don't mention that, because I think I don't have to, 
but that's true. That's true. Yeah, It is. But still, A lot of people say, ‘OK, nobody say nothing 
about me but I got the money so I'm happy. Some people they don't just, they care about the 
money, you know. They're interested in the money. To me, I'm not. I really do this job because I 
love the horses. I get a good pay and I'm happy with that. But the main thing is I love the horses. 
That's why I do the job. If I get money thats good. Thats good. But the main I feel more happy 
when the horse wins. Not for the money. Just because my job is there. My hand is there, you 
know. That's why I feel more happy. Like that.
