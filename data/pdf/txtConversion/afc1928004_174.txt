DAN MORRIS, 
IRISH COMEDIAN, VOCALIST, AND DANCER, 
THE subject of this sketch, Mr. Maurice Sullivan, was born in New York 
City, in 1848, of Irish parentage. 
As is customary with professionals, he 
adopted another name in the beginning of his theatrical career, selecting 
the name of " Dan Morris" for his professional title; by which name he 
is generally known. While Dan was yet a 
child, his parents removed to 
Troy, N. Y., and in West Troy be was reared and educated, and spent 
most of his youthful days in that locality. 
He made his first appearance on any stage in Philadelphia, when he was 
but fifteen years of age, under the direction of J. C. Stewart. Dan was 
only a 
pupil of Stewart's at that time, and appeared under the cognomen 
of " Master Morris," in the popular specialty "Es$ence of Old Virg inv." 
His parents, however, were not willing to consent to his pursuing the pro-
fession of his choice, and the young aspirant, being under age, was, there-
fore, obliged to return home, where he remained for more than four years. 
But Dan's passion for the stage could be restrained no lenger. 
lie joined 
the " Maffit and Bartholomew Pantomime Troupe," in New York, and 
opened with them at the Theatre Comique, Boston, and afterwards travelled 
with that organization through the -United States, for two years, as a 
comic 
vocalist and dancer. 
At the expiration of his engagement with this troupe, Mr. Tony Pastor, 
having witnessed his performances, urged him to adopt his present line of 
business- Irish Comedy and Vocalism. 
Taking his advice, he again ap-
peared at the Theatre Comique, Boston, but this time with " Cotton and 
Sharply's Minstrel's," and in the " ()Zia " 
his Irish songs and dances were 
received with great favor and applause. This success determined him to 
make Irish comedy a 
study. 
And in all the principal cities of the United 
States and the Dominion of Canada, and particularly in Utah and Califor-
nia, he received the highest encomiums of the press, and became a 
great fa-
vorite with the public. 
He was engaged by Mr. Chas. McEvoy, in April, ., 871, to perform the 
part of " Barney, the Guide," in his Original Hibernieon, in which charac-
ter he has achieved an unparalleled success. 
After this his reputation was 
so well established that Mr. John Howorth felt warranted in offering Mr. 
Morris a 
share in his New Ilibernica, which offer he accepted, and there-
after " Morris's & Howorth's New Ilibernica and Comedy Troupe" were 
everywhere reczivcd with the greatest favor and enthusiasm. 
Young in years, talented, ambitious, and of temperate habits - a 
favorite 
alike with managers and brother professianals -he has reached a 
high posi-
tion in the theatrical world, and gained an enviable hold in the affections 
and favors of the amusement-loving public.

Press Notices of Dan Morris, 
(While with " McEvoy's Hibernicon," and his present Entertainment.) 
" 
Mr. Morris, as 
Barney the Guide,' was irresistible, and during the 
evening the audience was convulsed with laughter at his witty sayings and 
droll auties."—Uttatva, Canada. 
" 
Mr. Morris is an easy, graceful, and versatile actor, who knows his 
points, minds his cues, and ties his limbs to the extreme delight and satis-
faction of his audience. He is perfectly at home on the stage, and adds 
pathos to eccentricity in almost the same breath."— Dayton (Ohio) Free 
Press. 
"Dan Morris. as the Irish Jaunting Carman,' has it complete concep-
tion of the character, and the roars of laughter which convulsed the house 
showed that his impersonations were appreciated."— Daily Ontario, Bellville. 
" 
Dan Morris is one of those comical Irishmen who never fail to have an 
inexhaustible fund of wit and humor continually on hand; and his devil-
ment last evening kept up a 
general roar of merriment "—Hamilton Even-
ing Times. 
" 
Morris is a 
good Irishman, and dances a 
jig equal to any at Donny-
brook."—Jfinareal Evening Star. 
"The singing and dancing of Mr. Dan Morris in the character of Bar-
ney,' were enthusiastically received."— Daily Iritness, Montreal. 
" 
Mr. Dan Morris is a 
young comedian of promise, with a 
striking apti-
tude for dialect parts."— San Francisco Correspondent of -The New York 
Clipper. 
" 
Mr. Dan Morris. as Barney the Guide,' is a 
most interesting feature 
of the entertainment. He is far the best Irish comedian and vocalist that 
ever appeared in Denver. In one of the scenes he assumes a 
Dutch charac-
ter which is simply immense."—Doirer (Colorado) Evening Times. 
" 
Mr. Morris in this character (Barney) is an excellent representation of 
the good-humored, honest Irish country lad; full of Handy Andy follies, 
and especially full of his love for Kitty. 
Mr. Morris was in his best mood, 
and his introduced Dutch songs and dances were received with shouts of 
laughter and applause."— Chicago Inter- Ocean, July 27, 1872. 
"He is certainly one of the best Irish comedians in the country. 
His 
Dutch business surprises every one; as the Irish servant girl he is admira-
ble. 
His complete metamorphosis proves his great power in versatile comic 
acting."—Lawrence (Kansas) Tribune. 
" 
Mr. Morris is droll enough. as Barney the Guide, to keep an audience 
amused if there were no other entertaininent."—G4den Era, San Francisco. 
" 
In the character of Barney the Guide. Morris is first rate; but in his 
German character he is perfectly in.eistible."—Courfer, Hannibal, Mo. 
" 
Barney, by Mr. Dan Morris, kept the audience convulsed with laugh-
ter."—lieraid, Quincy, Ill 
"Morris was frequently encored, and in his peculiar characters it would 
be difficult to find a 
better actor."—Daily Republican, Meriden, Conn. 
" 
Mr. Dan Morris as Barney has an opportunity to display his remark-
able versatility. 
As the Guide be is inimitable, and in all his changes of 
character is remarkably excellent.—PfUsburg Evening Mail. 
Extracts from Press Notices of Dan and 
Josie Morris. 
" 
The dramatic part of the performance was rendered in a 
style as faith-
ful to existing traditions as is possible to conceive, and with the added merit 
of being free from the slightest vulgarity in tone or sentiment. 
Mr. Dan 
Morris as Barney' is simply as entertaining as it is possible to be in the 
character, while Miss Josie Morris is just so clever and charming that she 
must have been tired of the encores last night—but the audience couldn't 
help it."— Toronto Globe, June 20, 1872. 
" 
Of course Dan Morris—' Barney, the Guide'—had already, on his pre-
vious visit, established himsPlf a 
general favorite with the Irish of Toronto, 
and was warmly welcomed back again by his ardent admirers, and well be 
repaid their attention in Irish wit, ` racy of the soil.' 
We may add that he 
was ably sustained in his courtship and other escapades by Miss Josie Mor-
ris as ' Kitty O'Conner.' "— Irish Canadian, Toronto, June 25, 1872.. 
" 
The Irish comedy of 
Kitty O'C.,nner' was put on the boards, and the 
part of 
Barney, the Guide,' was well sustained by Mr. Dan Morris, who 
is too well known in the character to need any encomium from us. 
Miss 
Josie Morris sustained the character of ' Bitty O'Connor,' and was a 
favor-
ite from her first appearance."—Ilataillon Evening Times, June 25, 1872. 
" 
The comedy of 
Kitty O'Connor' is an amusing one, and Barney, the 
Guide' has no better representative than Mr. Dan Morris. 
Miss Josie 
Morris, as Kitty,' sings nicely and dances excellently."—Hamillon Specta-
tor, June 25, 1872. 
" 
The pleasure of the audience was evinced by repeated bursts of tip-
plause over the life-like representations of Dan Morris as Barney' and 
—1 
_ Josie Morris as Kitty O'Connor,' whose performances were excellent, and 
proved them to be well-up in their line of business."— Binghamton Demo-
crat. 
" 
This is a 
first-class performance, and if there is an Irishman or woman 
in this city who fails to see Barney' and sweet Kitty O'Connor,' they are 
unworthy of the name. Everything is perfect: and Dan Morris Sullivan 
with Josie Morris Sullivan give the best representations of Irish character 
we have seen for a 
lung time. The Dutch character of Morris is hue." — 
East Saginaw Press. 
" 
The cast in the comedy of Kitty O'Connor' was well east. 
Mr. Dan 
Morris as Barney, the Guide,' and Miss Josie Morris as Kitty O'Connor.' 
are excellent cards in their speclalties."—Syrdeuse Free Press,

I'm generally known as Dancing Kit 
And an Irish girl am 
I'm always dancing and skipping along,

To be easy or rest a

song, 
And they call me Dancing Kit. 
CHORUS .

Until night comes in view, 
And then I 
come up here you see, 
To sing and dance for you.

POOLE. 
Original Song and Dance. 
Written and Sung by Mr. Deli MORRIS. 
On! here I 
am- a 
servant gal, 
The liveliest one that ever was born; 
You may talk about your servant gals, 
But they all call me the charmer; 
I'll work six days with all my might, 
To keep the pots and kettles bright, 
put the cobwebs out of sight, 
But I 
want to go out on Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I 
will' dance and I 
will sing, 
And I 
will do most anything, 
Will wash, will iron, will cook and sew, 
But I 
want to go out on Sunday. 
Whenever I 
show my purty face, 
And on the streets display such grace 
The nice young men will often fight 
To walk with me on Sunday night; 
My foot is nate, toy ankle small, 
Och! can't I 
shake them at a 
ball; 
So if you want to see a 
purty sight, 
Come out and see me on Sunday night. 
Yes, I 
will dance, etc. 
Now all you girls be warned by me, 
That have a 
fellow for company, 
If you have to fight with all your might, 
You wont get out on Sunday night. 
And when you go out to promenade, 
Make him treat you to lemonade; 
t's cheap and it wont make you tight, 
And will keep you steady on Sunday night., 
Yes, I 
will dance, etc,

SERGEANT PAT. 
Am.—" Tommy Dodd. 
No doubt you all have heard of me, 
And see me about town, 
And noticed of my handsome shape, 
Pat roving up and down; 
A model of the force am I, 
You may be sure of that, 
You'll always hear the girls cry, 
There's handsome Sergeant Pat. 
CHORUS. 
Who is it courts the kitchen maids ? 
Sergeant Pat! Sergeant Pat! 
Who makes the little boys afraid ? 
Sergeant Pat! Sergeant Pat! 
And when upon the thieves I 
drop, 
Sergeant Pat! Sergeant Pat! 
Oh! don't they cry, there comes a 
cop, 
Look out for Sergeant Pat! 
I 
came from Cork a 
year ago, 
And landed here, of course; 
I 
voted oft and early, and 
Of course, got on the force; 
A 
suit of blue, a 
locust club, 
To knock the fellows fiat, 
I 
got promoted, until now 
You see me Sergeant Pat! 
Who is it courts, etc. 
Of course I 
niver take a 
bribe— 
Unless I 
have a 
chance, 
If a 
prisoner doesn't " see" me, why 
With this I'll make him dance; 
At each attempt to break from me, 
I 
quickly smell a 
rat; 
And each back door on Sunday is 
Well known to Sergeant Pat! 
Who is it courts, etc.

JUDY CONNER'S DANCING SCHOOL. 
Written for and sung by Miss JOSIE Moans. 
Ant.--" Limerick Races." 
ONCE on a 
time in Dublin Town, 
There lived a 
dame so frisky, oh! 
Who kept a 
school of great renown, 
And also kept good whiskey, oh! 
She used to teach a 
dancin' class, 
And nightly set them prancin', 
And known all over town at last, 
Was Conner's school for dancin'. 
CHORUS . 
With her " Take yer Partners !" " Tune the fiddle," 
'Deed, I'm not romancing' oh! 
Ivery night ' twas down the middle, 
At Conner's school for dancin', oh! 
SPOKEN.—Good evening, young ladies, jist in time. 
Take yer 
partners for the Ballyhooligan Hornpipe. 
Now thin, attintion. 
1st position. 
Turn your toes out a 
little more, Miss Sullivan! 
You stand as if your feet didn't belong to you! Mary Brady, 
stop stain' pins in Tim Kennedy! 
Sure, he's too foine a 
boy 
to be made a 
pin- cushion of! Now thin, Murphy, you needn't 
be after thryin' to kiss Winnie in the corner there ! 
It's agin the 
rules of the school. 
Now thin, are ye all ready ? 
Shtrike up 
the music! 
(Dance.) 
Where Judy Conner learnt to dance 
It always was a 
mystery ; 
She used to say she learnt in France, 
But never told her history. 
(1) 
JUDY CONNER'S DANCING SCHOOL. 
Concluded. 
One day she had a 
sign put up, 
The expense sure she was chancin'i 
And on the sign in red and gould, 
Was " Conner's School for Dancin'." 
With her " Take yer Partners !" etc. 
SPOKEN.—Now thin, get on the floor here every one of ye. 
s'aohnny Callaghan, don't let me ever see ye come here again in 
them things. 
They're yer poor old mother's injin rubber over-
shoes! 
If ye can't afford a dacint pair of shoes, ye needn't 
come to my academy, for I 
will have the reshpecktability of it 
kept up. 
And you, McCarthy, d'ye mind, ye owe me saxpence 
hapenny for last week! 
Remember, those who dance must pay 
the piper. 
Now then, are ye all ready ? 
Play us up a 
bit of a 
reel. 
Whoo! 
(
Dance.) 
Now Judy's Dancin' School was known, 
All over the creation; 
In fact the dances she turned out, 
Were a 
credit to the nation; 
She taught the Dublin folks to dance, 
The smart ones and the fools, sir, 
To pass a 
pleasant night—the place 
Conner's Dancin' School, sir ! 
With her " Take yer Partners !" etc. 
SPOKEN.— W 1100! Get up here, iver:y' . mother's son of ye! 
Reilly, tie up yer shoe, you'll be tripping on the lace by and 
by! 
Now thin, ladies and gintlemen, we'll have the grand 
concluding dance of the evening. 
Take yer partners ! 
Are ye

And the crowner's jury sat on hit 
And found the man was dead. 
SPOKEN.—Yis—he was dead—as—well, as dead as Julius 
Sneezer—that I 
heard the schoolmaster talk about. 
And as the 
Judge— bad cess to him—said it was a 
case of deliberate ham-
merslide (homicide) widout intent to kill, and he sentenced poor 
Pat to twinty years transportation wid bard labor. 
And iwer

CHORUS. 
Won't yer buy an apple, mister, or will ye have a 
pear, 
They're fresh from the market to- day, sir; 
They're one and two a 
penny, and I 
ain't got many, 
And won't you buy an apple if you plaze, sir! (Dance.) 
It's meself that feels so lonely now, 
Since Patsey wint away, 
I'm going to save my money up, 
And cross the ragin' say; 
And \Olin America I 
reach, 
I'll start a 
trade so grand, 
Some day you'll see me in New York, 
A 
keepin' a 
peanut stand. 
SPOKEN.—Yis, but till that day you'll always hear me sing-

Won't you buy an apple, mister, etc. (Dance.)

When the trumpet of fame shall cease to proclaim thee, 
Of warriors the nurse, in the ages of yore; 
When the muse, and the record of genius disclaim thee, 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no more. 
When thy brave sons no longer are generous and witty, 
And cease to be loved by the fair they a,lore; 
When thy daughters no longer are virtuous and pretty— 
Then, Erin mavourneen, I'll love thee no wore.

There's not a

Can charm my heart like her I

Her step as light and graceful as the fawn, 
My love with safety in her heart reposes, 
My Irish Queen of hearts—my Colleen Hawn.

When Kitty dear will be my charming bride ; 
No lovers' quarrels keep our love from thriving ; 
We work all day, at night we meet with pride , 
My thoughts are ever constantly fixed on her, 
At twilight gray or when I 
rise at dawn, 
And in my sleep I'll sometimes wake and murmur, 
A single magic word—'tis " Colleen Bawn!" 
My love for her, etc.

NEW YERSION OF ERIN MY COUNTRY. 
As sung by Miss JOSIE MORRIS, in the " Emigrant" Scene, in the " Grand 
Hibernica." 
ERIN, my country, I 
love thy green bowers, 
No music to me like thy murmuring rills, 
The shamrock to me is the sweetest of flowers, 
And naught is more dear than thy daisy- clad bills. 
The caves that were used by the warriors past ages, 
Are still sacred held in each Irishman's heart ; 
And thy ivy- crowned tunnels, the pride of past ages, 
Though moldering in ruins do grandeur impart. 
Erin, my country, although thy harp slumbers, 
And lies in oblivion in 'I'ara's old halls, 
Scarce one kind hand to awake thy calm numbers, 
And sound a 
low dirge to the sons of Drugall ; 
Thy trophies of warfare may hang there neglected, 
For cold lie the warriors to whom they were known, 
And the harp of old Erin shall be still respected, 
While there lives but one hand to awaken its tone. 
Britannia may boast of her lion and armor, 
And glory when she her old wooden walls view; 
Caledonia may boast of her pibroch and claymore, 
And pride in her philibeci, kilt and her hose; 
But where is the nation that can rise on old Erin, 
And where is the country such heroes can boast ? 
In battle they're brave as the lion and tiger, 
And proud as the eagle that flies round her coast.

As we dhrive along at a 
pace so risky. 
CHORIIS.—Dhrivin' down the road, down the road to Dublin, 
Lavin all behind, on the road to- Dublin.

And together we drive out to the races, 
Don't the people smile, at our happy faces.

PADDY BLAKE'S ECHO.

PADDY BLAKE'S EC110.—LCONOLUDED. 
If you eivily spake 
How d'ye do, Paddy Blake. 
Tha echo politely says very well, thank you. 
One day Teddy Keogh, 
With KatehConnor did go, 
To hear from the echo this wanderful talk, sir, 
But the echo they say 
Was couthrairy that day, [sir, 
Or, perhaps, Paddy Blake had gone out for a 
walk, 
Now, says Teddy to Kate 
'Tis too hard to be bate 
By this deaf and dumb baste of an echo so lazy, 
But if we both shout 
To each other no doubt 
We'll make up an echo between us, my daisy. 
Now Kitty, says Teddy, 
To answer be ready, 
Oh, very well thank you, cries out Kitty then, sir, 
Would you like to be wed 
Kitty darling, says Ted, 
Oh, very well thank you, says Kitty again, sir, 
Do you like me, says Teddy, 
And Kitty quite ready, 
Cried, very well thank you, with laughter beguiling, 
I 
think you'll confess 
Teddy could not do less, 
Than pay his respects to the lips that were smiling. 
Oh, dear Paddy Blake 
May you never forsake 
Those hills that return us such echoes endearing; 
And may girls all translate 
Their answer like Kate, 
No faithfulness doubtin', no treachery fearing, 
And boys be you ready 
Like frolicsome Teddy, 
But earnest in loving, though given to joking, 
And thus when inclined 
May all true lovers find 
Sweet echoes to answer from hearts they're invoking

THE HUNGRY ARMY. 
When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
thought I'd go and join the line, 
And as a 
soldier cut a 
shine, 
In a 
lot called the Hungry Army. 
Said the sergeant you are just the chap. 
And placed a 
knapsack on my back, 
They sent me off to Ballarat, 
To fight in the Hungry Army. 
CHORUS. 
Sound the bugle, blow the horn, 
Fight for glory night and morn, 
Hungry soldiers, ragged and torn, 
Just returned from the army. 
March, boys, march, the way is on before us, 
Shout, boys, shout, and join us in the chorus, 
March, boys, march, the foe is still advancing, 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy land. 
I 
went to drill on one fine day. 
The wind was rather strong that way. 
It fact it blew us all away, 
This glorious hungry army. 
I've got a 
medal as you see, 
The workhouse presented it to me, 
For hanging to a 
rotten tree, 
When the wind took the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, &c. 
They cut my hair with a 
knife and fork, 
And curled it with a 
cabbage stalk, 
And fed me on some cabbage broth, 
To fight in the hungry army. 
They served it out in a 
large tin can, 
A 
teaspoonful to every man, 
I 
got so fat I 
could'nt stand, 
To fight in the hungry army 
Then sound the bugle, cte. 
They sent me out to drill recruits, 
But they kicked me with their hobnailed boots; 
Oh, take! oh, take away these brutes, 
Of this glorious hungry army. 
Now kind friends I 
must be off, 
I 
think I 
smell the mutton broth, 
here comes Generals Howl and Scoff, 
The heads of the hungry army.

0, THE heart in my bosom is pining away, 
For the sweet little girl that .I

She's my thought ev'ry hour, she's my dream ev'ry night, 
And my head spins around like a

When I 
think of the eyes, roguish, merry and bright, 
Of my own darling, Katy MacNeil. 
0, the roses that bloom in the valley so fair, 
Win a 
blush from the glow of her charms, 
And the birds of the spring as they sail through the air, 
How they long but to fly to her arms. 
0, the depths of her eyes, how they gaze into mine, 
While she lists to my heart's fond appeal ; 
There's no one so neat, there's no one so sweet, 
As my own darling Katy MacNeil. 
She's my thought, etc. 
There's a 
smile on her face, there's a 
kiss when we meet, 
And a 
laugh in her bright sunny eyes, 
And the words that she whispers are loving and sweet, 
And her heart ev'ry sorrow defies. 
0 ! she's dear to me now, but she never can know 
All the love that my soul could reveal ; 
She's the star of my life, she's my angel in strife, 
She's my own darling Katy MacNeil. 
She's my thought, etc.

And set toe dancing mad. (Dance.) 
CHORUS. 
I'm mad, mad, you see I'm dancing mad, 
Mad, mad, oh! yes, I'm dancing mad. 
'Twas to a 
ball a 
week ago, 
With Judy I 
did go ; 
I 
never thought she would turn out, 
For to treat me so. 
Now all you boy be warned by me, 
And those that have a 
beau, 
Just keep your eyes upon your girls, 
Else they will treat you so. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I'm mad, and it was enough to make me mad 
to have so purty a 
girl as Judy McFad for to give me the mit-
ten. 
Oh ! but she was a 
handsome girl. 
You should have seen 
her. 
She was so purty. 
She was as purty as brouw paper-
Then she had such a 
delicate little mouth— why, when she 
would laugh, it was impossible for any decent, respectable per-
son to see her face at all, at all. 
And her hands, 0 ! they were 
nice little hands ! 
Talk about your kid- glove hands—begorra, 
she used to wear bo.7Cng-gloves ! 
Oh ! but her feet, they were 
the purtiest part of her boay. 
She used to wear " Two's "—I 
mean the two sides of a 
cow's skin. 
But now she's gone—per-
haps to jail, and I 
hope she will never come back, and since 
she's gone I 
have been  
Mad, mad, etc.

THE DEAR LITTLE SHAMROCIC.—NoNcLuDED.] 
That dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin; 
Whose smiles can bewitch and whose eyes can command 
In each climate they ever appear in. 
For they shine thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
Just like their own dear little Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from the stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
From one root should branch like the Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
OCH! NORAH DEAR! 
Och I 
Nora!' dear I 
I'm waiting here, 
I'm watching still for you, love: 
And while you sleep, the flow'rets weep, 
All stained in tears of dew, love. 
The silvery moon its bright rays soon 
Behind the hills will fade, love 
But better there her beauties bear: 
For thou her beams would shade, love. 
Och! Norah dear! dm. 
Och! Norah dear 1 
I'm waiting here, 
The stars look cold and blue, love: 
Their twinkling rays have come to gaze, 
To see how bright are you, love ;

From all that's bright and fair, love; 
It sighs to sip from thy sweet lip 
The perfume that lies there, love.

ROLLICKING IRISH BARNEY. 
SONG AND DANCZ. 
Composed by CHAS. MAC Evor. 
As sung by BAENEY THE GINDE. 
I'm the rollicking Irish Barney, 
I 
deliht to dance and sing, 
I'm fu 1 
of the divil and blarney, 
And all of that sort of thing. 
Just watch my graceful motions, 
As I 
move upon the floor, 
If my foot but took a 
notion, 
It would never stop I'm sure. 
(Dance.) 
CHORUS. 
B-a- r-n-e-y, 
Am I 
not full of the blarney, 
Just watch my foot astore, 
Its motion is so sure, 
The ladies' eyes they follow mine as 1 
trip about the floor. 
(Dance.) 
(Repeat the ladies' eyes, & e.) 
I 
have traveled this country over, 
And to stop I 
don't know how, 
For I 
always must keep moving,

But somehow or another,

When I

And of course it pleases me.

GOOD evening folks, pray how are you? 
I've come to sing what I 
can do; 
When I 
arrived ' twould make you laugh, 
For I 
came upon the telegraph. 
It's only lately I 
came out, 
But I 
understand phat I'm about, 
I'm ready now to take employ, 
For I'm an Irish active boy. 
For I 
can dance, and I 
can sing, 
And I 
will try a 
highland fling. (Dance.) 
Oh! I 
can dance an Irish jig, 
Can drive a 
team or kill a 
pig; 
can take me part in any row, 
I 
can sail a 
yacht or row a 
scow, 
I 
can make me hair to nicely curl, 
It will charm the hearts of all the girls ; 
And, ov coorse, I 
am the ladies' joy, 
For I'm an Irish active boy. 
And now I 
will to change the rig, 
Give you a 
touch of an Irish jig. (Dance.)

So here I 
am the active boy, 
Ready for any one's employ, 
From a 
bootblack to a 
brigadier, 
When I'm required I'm always here. 
But, by the way, I 
suppose you know 
It's nearly time for me to go; 
So, ladies and gents, to please I've tried, 
And I 
hope that you all are satisfied. 
But now before I 
go to- night, 
I'll try to give you a 
clog- hornpipe. (

WHAT WILL YOU DO, LOVE ? 
DUET. 
W HAT will you do, love, when I 
am going 
With white sail flowing, the seas beyond, 
What will you do love, when waves divide us, 
And friends may chide us for being fond ? 
Tho' waves divide us and friends be chiding, 
In faith abiding I'll still be true, 
And I'll pray for thee on the stormy ocean 
In deep devotion— that's what 1 
a 
do. 
What would you do, love, if distant tidings 
Thy fond confiding should undermine, 
Were I, abiding ' neath sultry skies, 
Should think other eyes were as bright as thine ? 
Oh! name it not—tho' guilt and shame 
Was on thy name I'd still be true; 
But that heart of thine, should another share it, 
I 
could not bear it—what would Idol 
THE NATE JAUNTING CAR. 
Written for and sung by Miss Josm Alonius. 
Am.—" Sprig of Shillaleh." 
My name is O'Connor, it is ' pon me honor; 
My mother's a 
widow, good luck be upon her, 
My father was killed in the Crimean war. 
I 
love a 
young man, his name it is Dan, 
At dancing or fighting sure beat him who can; 
Wid his smack! zip! at the crack of his whip, 
The girls will come trooping from near and from far 
To see my lad Dan and his nate jaunting car. 
My Dan is a 
jintleman, Irish of course, 
And a 
frisky old crature's Napoleon, his horse, 
That once won a 
race in the Limerick Course. 
If walking down street, my Dan you should meet, 
It's twenty to one he offers to treat, 
Wid his smack! zip! at the crack of his whip, 
The boys will come trooping from near and from far 
To drink to the health of himself and his car.

REST, DARLING, REST. 
Beside the streamlet in the vale, 
In dreamless sleep my Ilaggie lies, 
Her warbling voice is hushed and still, 
And closed in death her azure eyes; 
Yea, here we oftentimes did meet, 
And sit beside the purling stream, 
But now she slumbers ' neath my feet, 
And vanished is my happy dream.

Rest darling, rest, sleep dear one, sleep, 
From care and sorrow thou art free, 
Though at thy grave, I 
grieve and weep, 
'Ls sweet to know there's rest for thee. 
With broken heart I 
stand alone, 
And list to nature's plaintive strain, 
And in each sad and plaintive tone, 
I 
seem to hear her voice again ; 
Though I 
be spared till old and gray, 
My Maggie I 
shall not forget, 
Supreme my love shall reign always, 
Until life's ruling sun shall set. 
Rest darling, leo.

PADDY IS THE BOY, 
It's some years ago, I 
very well know, 
Since I 
first saw day-light with my two blessed eyes; 
I 
was born, so they say, when my Dad was away, 
On St. Patrick's day, in the morning. 
How they nursed me with joy; said: what a 
fine boy) 
Put a 
stick in my fist, by the way of a 
toy; 
Faith! there's no mistake, they admired my make, 
And said some day I'd give the girls a 
warming. 
CEMEnS. 
For, Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
glass, 
Paddy is the boy that's fond of a 
lass! 
Dear Old Dublin is the place for me, 
And Donnybrook is the place to go for a 
spre. 
At a 
wake or a 
fair, poor Paddy is there; 
He will tight foe or friend, if they do him offend; 
Let the piper strike up, he will rise from his cup, 
With a 
smile on his face adorning. 
With his little Colleen, he'll dance on the green, 
Sure, an Irishman, there, in his glory was seen 
Play a 
reel or jig, he don't care a 
fig 
But he'll dance till day-light, in the morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy, &a 
Now boys, do you mind; yon never will find, 
Such a 
dear little place as the Emerald Isle; 
Long, long, may it stand, and good luck to the land, 
That dear Old St. Patrick was born in! 
May the girls, young and old, may the boys, brave an,) 
unite, heart and hand, to protect the dear Isle! 
And, morn. noon and night, may joy and delight 
&Ana on them, like a 
fine Summer's morning. 
For, Paddy is the boy, tfre.

DENNIS DEAR, 
ARE YOU FORGETTLNG ? 
As sung by Miss Josin M ORRIS, in the " Grand Hibernian." 
The Music of this Song is published by W HITTEMORE, Detroit, Mich. 
DENNIS dear, are you forgetting 
That your Kathleen's waiting here ? 
For you promised that in spring time, 
That you surely would be near; 
Long the flowers have been blushing, 
And daisies blooming on the lea. 
Come back, Dennis, I'm so lonely, 
Darling, soon return to me, return to me. 
CHORUS 
Dennis, dear, are you forgetting 
Your own Kathleen o'er the sea ? 
Come back Dennis, I'm so lonely, 
Darling, soon return to me. 
Dennis dear, are you forgetting 
All the tales of love you told ? 
When you said " goo l 
bye" at parting, 
Round me then your arms did fold; 
Write a 
letter to me, Dennis, 
0 tell me that you'll soon be near, 
And I'll wait just by the sea shore, 
For the good ship to appear to me, to me.

MY 
lover's an Irishman, hardy and free, 
With sorra a 
trouble or care on his mind, 
He's brimful of merriment, mischief and glee, 
In Dublin you'll not such another one find; 
His nate jaunting car is known near and far, 
There's not a 
colleen but with him likes to ride, 
And if you should walk from Dublin to Cork, 
You'll not find another like Daniel the Guide. 
CHORUS. 
Daniel the Guide, (
Symp.) my joy and my pride, (Symp.) 
Don't be forgettin' if a 
car you'd be gettin', 
You can't find another like Daniel the Guide. 
In Dublin so grand, sure you'll see on the stand 
His nate jaunting car that is fit for a 
queen, 
And Daniel will holler a 
car for your honor, 
There's not such another one on College Green; 
And when he gets rich, he'll be off on a 
stich 
To America, sure, with my joy and my pride, 
With dancing and singinm, and with the bells ringing, 
The day I 
get married to Daniel the Guide. 
Daniel the Guide, etc.

THE LITTLE COLLEBN.--LCONcLuDED.] 
My father had gone to his work on the farm, 
My mother was minding the dairy, 
To go to the fair I 
thought it no harm, 
So tripped it as light as a 
fairy; 
The lads and the lasses were dancing with glee, 
Miss Macarty was out with big Harry; 
I 
looked all around, but no where could I 
see 
My swateheart, my own darling Larry. 
Cho.—Then success, &c. 
Then the piper struck up wid a 
beautiful tune, 
Och, the music he play'd was delightful; 
If Larry don't come I'll go mad very soon, 
For indade I 
was getting quite spiteful; 
They kissed in the ring, the buckle they crost, 
My feet I 
could scarcely keep quiet, 
I 
wanted a 
jig, but my partner I'd lost, 
When I 
get him I'll kick up a 
riot. 
Clio.—Then success, &c. 
Mister Larry in the midst of th,e fair I 
did spy, 
He was dancing a 
lilt so delicious 
With Mistress Kate Kearney; to myself then thinks I, 
This conduct is rather suspicious; 
To trate me so lightly, you'll say 'twas a 
shame, 
When admirers I 
know I 
have plenty, 
To put up with such conduct I'd be much to blame, 
Where he's one swateheart, I 
can get twinty. 
Clto.—Then success, &c. 
If a 
nate Irish boy in the company here 
Will propose then, no longer I'll tarry; 
If he's English I 
don't mind, bekase I've a 
fear 
I'm getting too ould now to marry; 
If he's Scotch I 
don't mind, for I 
now feel inclined 
For his conduct to make Larry whistle ; 
If we wed, our affections they shall be entwined 
Like the Shamrock, the Rose, and the Thistle. 
Cho.—Then success, &c.

THE IRISH A CTIVE GIRL. 
Written for and sung by Allid JOSIE M ORRIS. 
I'M an Irish girl as you can see, 
Fall of dancing, fun and glee; 
I'm jigging both by day and night, 
To dance for you is my delight; (Symphony.) 
And whenever to a 
show I 
go, 
Something new I 
learn you know; 
The last I 
learnt you now shall see, 
A 
hornpipe's just what suited me. 
CHORUS. 
So dancing both by night and day, 
When work is done I 
likes to play, 
And now to please you all to-night, 
I'm going to dance a 
short hornpipe. 
The neighbors say I'm dancing mad. 
Well, if I 
am I'm very 2lad ; 
Of course what I 
likes best you know, 
Is to show the boys what I 
can do; (Symphony.) 
And when to balls or hops I 
go, 
I 
gets upon the floor to show 
Them how to dance, just for a 
rig, 
I 
dance for them the Excelsior Jig.

And when at night I 
goes to bed, 
Such funny dreams get in my head ; 
My feet such steady time do keep, 
find I'm dancing in my sleep ; (
Symphony.' 
never hear the music play, 
But I 
feel like dancing right away, 
And when the jolly waltz I 
whirl, 
They say that I'm an active girl.

So dancing lightly all the day, 
When work is done I 
likes to play, 
Before I

THE LADS WHO LIVE IN IRELAND. 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE MAU R'S 
GROW 
Aly name is Ned UManney, I 
was born in sweet Killarney-, 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plough, reap or mow; 
And, if I 
met a 
pretty girl, I 
never practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know: 
I'm none of your Bulgrudderies, nor other shabby families, 
But can unto in 
pedigree a 
pretty title show: 
Oh I 
I'm of the O's and Mac's, and likewise the sturdy Whacks, 
CLIORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree : 
My Mother was a 
Hogan, but my Father I 
don't know ; 
I've ninety-nine relations in a 
place they call Rosearberry, 
And each unto their name has a 
Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan: 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show : 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid; 
For, I 
was born in Ireland, & c. 
May Heaven still protect our hospitable Country. 
Where first I 
drew my living breath, and heard its cocks to crow! 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely bay of Bantry! 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to show. 
Oh I 
those scenes I 
did enjoy, like a 
gay, unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, ttc. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man in truth, was he; 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go : 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be: 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show; 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found. 
Tban the lads who live in Ireland, dm..

MISTER CARNEY, NONE OF YOUR BLARNEY. 
As sung by Miss JOSIE Mounts. 
MrsTER Carney one day went to Limerick Fair, 
And hired a 
noddy to carry him there, 
To meet pretty Shelah Megan; 
But Shelah had waited some time for the boy, 
And thought he'd been playing with Katty Malloy, 
So to tell him her mind she began : 
" 
Och ! Mister Carney, none of your blarney, 
hands off, and don't be so free, 
You've been with the girls, your guilty face tells, 
And Old Nick may have you for me, Mister Carney." 
• 
Mister Carney, who little thought thus to be used, 
Now protests that his honor and word she'd abused, 
And could she be Shelah Megan I 
Then trying to kiss her—she cried, " If you're wise, 
Don't touch me, Carney, I'll scratch out your eyes, 
I 
know you're a 
vile wicked man ! 
So Mister Carney, none of your blarney ; 
Hands off, and don't be so free, 
You've been with the girls, your guilty face tells, 
And Old Nick he may have you for me, Mister Carney." 
Mister Carney then sought for a 
bit of a 
rope, 
And told her that since he had nothing to hope, 
He'd hang up for Shelah Megan! 
But Shelah, grown softer, his purpose to check, 
Cried, " No, if you hang, let it be round my neck ; 
Tho' Carney, ain't you a 
sad man ? 
Och! Mister Carney, none of your blarney, 
And is it the ring there I 
see 
We'll ride in the noddy to Father O'Toddy, 
And married—Och ! yes, we will be, Mister Carney."

NEW VERSION OF LIMERICK RACES. 
Written for and sung by Miss Tosm Momirs. 
Tills morn when first the sun it did shine, 
I 
dressed meself so nate and so tine, 
And tied me brogues wid six inches of twine, 
'Twas meself that lost the laces. 
And soon we did start wid pony and cart, 
I 
sat beside the joy of me heart, 
One Barney McCormick, a 
boy so smart, 
And drove to Limerick Races. 
As soon as ever we got on the ground, 
We took a 
swing in a 
merry go round, 
Meself felt queer, goin' up and down, 
I 
wished the swing to blazes; 
But sale and sound we reached the ground, 
And Barney thin, the circus found, 
Wid the horses and clown all upside down, 
We saw at Limerick Races. 
Soon after that the band it did play, 
And all the folks they trotted away, 
To see the horses galloping gay, 
Oh! wasn't it fun! Good gracious! 
Such pulling of rags, and waving of flags, 
The pipers a 
squeezing their chanters and bags, 
And the jockeys a-ridin' their long-legged nags, 
We saw at Limerick Races. 
And after the race we stepped in a 
tent, 
On supping the " cratur " my Barney was bent, 
And up in his bead the " poteen " it went, 
And made him as drunk as blazes; 
In a 
quarrel he got wid Judy and Throt, 
She blackened his eye wid a 
cast iron pot, 
If I 
hadn't been there such a 
bating he'd got, 
He'd never forget the races. 
When the fun of the day was over and past, 
Thin Barney dhrove up wid the pony at last, 
And off for home we started so fast, 
Wid happy and shining faces. 
And on the road home did Barney contrive 
To ask me to be his own little wife, 
And soon we'll be married and settled for life, 
And all through Limerick Races.

BARNEY, 
COME BACK TO ME. 
As sung by Miss JOSIE Mounts, with the " Grand Etibernica." 
BARNEY, come back from o'er the Atlantic, 
Back to the heart that is longing for thee ; 
Ever I'm waiting to see in the distance, 
The ship that is bearing you, darling, to we. 
Long have I 
waited, waited so lonely, 
Why did I 
let you go forth from my heart, 
My lips for your kisses are eagerly waiting, 
Barney, no never again shall we part, 
Barney, no never again shall we part. 
CHORUS. 
Barney, my lips for your kisses are waiting, 
Why did I 
let you go forth from my heart, 
Long have I 
waited, yes waited so lonely, 
Barney, no never again shall we part. 
Barney, return, the shamrock is blooming, 
Nature is smiling in valleys and dells ; 
Darling, I'm waiting where first we did wander, 
Where oft we heard ringing the dear village bells 
Oft have you said you'd ne'er forget Kathleen, 
Your colleen, you left in that cot o'er the sea, 
I've prayed for the hour when we shall be meeting, 
Barney, do hasten my darling to me, 
Barney, do hasten my darling to me. 
Barney, my lips, etc.

KITTY McKA.Y. 
As sung by Miss JOKE MORRIS. 
BRIGHT as the flowers that bloom in the meadow, 
Is Kitty's bright beautiful smile; 
With form like a 
fairy, she trips like a 
shadow 
Adown the green path by the stile; 
With voice like the robin, she gayly comes singing, 
Her tones floating out on the air, 
Sounding like silver bells merrily ringing, 
No voice can with Kitty's compare. 
CHORUS. 
Kitty, Kitty, charming young Kitty McKay, 
Kitty, Kitty, roguish- eyed Kitty McKay. 
Eyes blue as violets, cheeks like the roses, 
And breath like the jessamine blow, 
Her ruby lips parting, so sweetly discloses, 
Such beautiful teeth white as snow ; 
While over her shoulders so gracefully flowing, 
hang ringlets of soft golden hair; 
While from her eyes a 
sweet love- light is glowing, 
As pure as the jewels so rare. 
Kitty, Kitty, etc. 
Light is her heart, ever pure and confiding, 
She's true and unchanging in love; 
Each joy and each pleasure with others dividing, 
She's gentle and mild as the dove. 
If Kitty would spare me of love but a 
portion, 
'Twould make me so happy each day, 
Fondly, sincerely, with heartfelt devotion, 
I'd always love Kitty McKay. 
Kitty, Kitty, etc.

NEW VERSION . OF THE IRISH CUPID. 
AB 
sung by Miss JOSIE M ORRIS, in the " Grand Itibernica." 
Music published by Pon 
16.: Co., N. Y. 
On! Cupid is a 
native god, 
Erin is his mother ; 
And Ireland is his own abode, 
He never had another; 
In Blarney's groves the boy was bred, 
And buttermilk his pap was, 
Until with whiskey he was fed, 
Which rather a 
mishap was, 
For it made him so warm and bold, 
That still it is no wonder, 
All great and small, and young and old, 
To Irish love knock under. 
CHORUS. 
Och! love's an Irishman's employ, 
And at it he's a 
genius, 
For Cupid is an Irish boy ; 
Each Irish girl's a 
Venus I 
Love's a 
shillaleh for his dart, 
From which there's no retreating; 
For tender to make ev'ry heart, 
lie gives them all a 
beating. 
St. Patrick his godfather was, 
Who said, " you young Philistine," 
To Irishmen give love for ten, 
And then you'll be a 
Christian; 
For Irish hearts are twice as large 
As any other nation's, 
There's always room when strangers come, 
Besides their blood relations. 
Och ! love's an Irishman's employ, etc. 
Love's blind and bare I 
do declare, 
And lives upon potaties; 
Why he is so if you would know, 
Why, faith, I'll tell you gratis. 
Love made each Irish boy so bright, 
They soon found beauty's prize out, 
For which, poor urchin, out of spite, 
The heathens tore his eyes out. 
And to be sure he'd never roam, 
And so deserve our loathing, 
To keep love with us always at home, 
We took away his clothing. 
For love's an Irishman's employ, etc.

MY BARNEY. 
Written for and sung by Miss JOSIE Mortars, in the " Grand Hibernica." 
AIR.—" Teddy McGlynn." 
MY 
name pon me honor is Kitty O'Connor, 
And I 
live near the city of Dublin so grand; 
My lover's name's Barney, he's tipped wid the blarney, 
And his car any day you can see on the stand. 
As he drives thro' the street, sure you Diver can meet 
Another wid such a 
sweet blarneying smile ; 
Himself is a 
picture so trim and so neat, sir, 
And he is the boy that my heart does beguile. 
My Barney the guide, ' tis he is my pride, 
And he is the boy that'll make me his bride. 
In ructions and fighting he takes a 
delight in, 
A 
jolly good shindy it fills him wid glee, 
And sometimes a 
drop of" the cratur" he'll sup, 
He drinks nothing stronger than whiskey, d'ye see. 
A 
long time we've tarried and soon we'll get married; 
And won't I 
be proud when I 
sit by his side, 
All dressed in my best, wid silks and the rest, 
As I 
leap on his car and to church we will ride. 
Me and Barney the guide, my joy and my pride, 
'Tis he is the boy that'll make me his bride. 
LIMERICK IS BEAUTIFUL. 
As sung in the " Grand Hibernica." 
On, Limerick it is beautiful, as everybody knows, 
The River Shannon full of fish beside that city flows; 
'Tis not the river nor the fish that weighs upon me mind, 
Nor with the town of Limerick I've any fault to find. 
Oh, the girl I 
love is beautiful, she's bright-eyed as the fawn, 
She lives at Garryowen, and she's called the Colleen Bawn; 
And proudly as that river flows beside that great city, 
Still prouder and without a 
smile that colleen goes by me. 
Oh, hone! oh, hone! 
Oh, Limerick, it is beautiful, as everybody knows. 
Oh, if I 
was the Emperor of Russia to command, 
Or Julius Csar, or the Lord Lieutenant of the land, 
I'd give me goold and silverplate, likewise me army, 
The horse guards, the rifles, and the royal artillery ; 
I'd give the crown of my head, me people on their knee, 
I'd give me fleet of sailing ships upon the briny sea ; 
A 
beggar, I 
would go to rest to rise at, early dawn, 
If by me side, just as a 
bride, I'd find the Colleen Bawn. 
Oh, hone! oh, hone! 
! 
Limerick it is beautiful, as everybody knows. 
ERIN IS MY HOME. 
Oh, I 
have roamed in many lands, 
And many friends I've met; 
Not one fair scene or kindly smile 
Can this fond heart forget; 
But I'll confess that I'm content, 
No more I 
wish to roam; 
Oh, steer my bark to Erin's Isle, 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh, steer my ba/k, S
7-C. 
If England were my place of birth 
I'd love her tranquil shore, 
But if Columbia were my home 
Her freedom I'd adore. 
Tho' pleasant days in both I 
passed, 
I 
dream of days to come; 
Oh, steer my bark to Erin's Isle, 
For Erin is my home. 
Oh, steer my bark, .kc. 
THE HARP 
THAT ONCE THRO' TARA'S Haus. 
The harp that once thro' Tara's halls 
The soul of music shed, 
Now hangs as m•;te on Tara's walls 
As if that soul had fled. 
So sleeps the pride of former days, 
So glory's thrill is o'er, 
And hearts that once beat high for prai-e, 
Now feel that pulse no more. 
No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
The harp of Tara swells; 
The chord alone, that breaks at night, 
Its tale of ruin tells. 
Thus freedom now seldom wakes : 
The only throb it gives 
Is when some heart indignant breaks 
To show that she still lives. 
PADDY Mc CARTHY THE IRISH' TINKER. 
Written by John 0' Brien Egan for Dan Bryant. 
liespec4fulty dedicated to Eton. Timothy McCarthy of San Francisco, 
by his friend Dan Bryant. 
In liallinahack there resides an ould man. 
That can handle a 
chanter a 
spade or a 
pan, 
For his tinkering trade he's a 
beautiful plan, 
And his name is ould Paddy McCarthy. 
He rises at seven his work to begin, 
And he wallops away wid his sodder an tin, 
The girls wid their tar pots and kitties come in 
To be mended by Paddy McCarthy. 
On Fridays he goes to the market at Clare. 
Wid fresh lard on his brogues, and the same on hls 
hair. 
He gets drunk and throws his hat in the air, 
Who wants to fight says old Paddy Mc earthy. 
One Shaun 0' Meaney a 
piper by trade, 
Who can chanter a 
stick or a 
spade, 
Swore a 
divil a 
tinker ever was made 
Eould wrastle ould Paddy McCarthy. 
One Dennis Gilloughly, a 
comical card, 
Wid a 
noddle as bald as a 
bladder of lard, 
Got jealous of Paddy from the way that he spar'd, 
So he challenged ould Paddy McCarthy 
They fought for two hours, but he murdered poor Mac, 
Wid a 
left handed skelp on the broad of his back. 
Paddy lay on the floor like a 
coal porter's sack, 
God be good to ould Paddy McCarthy. 
Po .r 
Paddy is dead, now the solderin' rogue, 
Tho' that left handed skelp from Gilloughly's kithogue 
Every boy in the village will lay 
bugrougue, 
Wid sorrow for Paddy McCarthy. 
His silent remains was stuck under the clay, 
Wid his budget and soddar in glory he lay, 
I 
hope for the corpse every Christian will ;1'ay, 
When they read of ould Paddy McCarthy.

THE JAUNTING CAR, 
OR " 
DONNYBROOK." 
Written for and sung by Miss Josre M ORRIS. 
Am. —" Low Backed Car." 
'TWA S 
on a 
Monday morning in the merry month of May, 
I 
started off for Donnybrook, dressed out so fine and gay, 
The birds were singing gayly, and the road I 
do declare, 
Was thronged wid cars and people who were off to see the fair, 
And I 
drove in a 
jaunting car, 
And both from near and far, 
They said I 
was sweet, and looked pretty and neat, 
As I 
sat in my jaunting car. 
Now of all the pretty fellows that I 
saw at the fair, 
There was not one that to my mind wid Barney could compare; 
He showed me all the funny sights and paid for everything, 
And hinted all the afternoon about a 
wedding ring. 
And there being a 
seat in the car, 
As my home was a 
little too far 
To go all alone, so then he saw me borne, 
And drove back in the jaunting car. 
Now whin we left the fair behind, and got upon the p:ke, 
Sure Barney got to whispering, and made love wid all his might, 
And before I 
reached me home at all, I 
said I'd be his wife, 
So now we're to be married and we'll live a 
happy life: 
And we'll drive to the church in the car, 
And the folks from near and far, 
Will join in the fun, when the wedding is done, 
And wid luck to meself and car. 
MY LOVE NELL. 
Ant—" Come all ye.* 
Oh I 
come all, you boys, both far and tata4 
And listen a 
while to me: 
And a 
dismal story you will hear 
About my love and me. 
I 
coorted long., my love was sthrong 
As the heart of a 
big oak three; 
But sorry I'm to say 
My love is gone away 
To the shores av Amer-i-kay. 
CHORUS. 
For, ray love 'cell 
Was a 
cliarmin' girl: 
From the cove av Cork kern ske. 
But I 
weeped and I 
vailed 
Whin the big ship sailed 
For the shores av America. 
Whin 1 
got to the church, 
I 
was left in the lurch.. 
But let that day go by; 
Whin • got to the door, 
Nelly sez; I'm poor I 
Then, my love, sez I, good-bye? 
For, I 
know right well 
You're an Irish girl; 
So, you don't come over me. 
Oh I 
sez Nelly, d'ye mind, 
I'll lave you far behind, 
And I'll sail for America. 
For, my love Nell, ek.e. 
Now, come all, ye boys, both far and near, 
And a 
warnin' take by me: 
A bird in the hand, as you may undherstand, 
Is worth twinty thousand million on a 
three. 
Though persuade you they may for to name the day, 
Then say, Wait till the time suits me. 
Then as slippery as an eel, they'll turn on their heel, 
And sail for America. 
For, my love Nell. 4floq,

Now let me alone, though I 
know you won't, 
I 
know you won't, I 
know you won't ; 
Let me alone, though I 
know you wen'r, 
Impu ,lent Barney O'Hea. 
It makes me outrageous, when you're so contagious, 
And you'd better Vol; out for the stout Gurney Creagh: 
For he is the boy that believes I'm his joy, 
So, you'd better behave yourself, Bi.rney O'Hea; 
Impudent Barney, none of your blarney. 
Impudent Barney O'Hea. 
I 
hope you're not going to Brandon fair, 
To Brandon fair, to Brandon fair ; 
For, indeed, l'm not wanting to meet you there, 
Impudent Barney O'Hea. 
For, Corney's at Cork, and my brother's at work, 
And my mother sits spinning, at home, all the day, 
So, no one will be there of poor me to take care, 
So, I 
hope you won't follow me, Bari ey O'Ilen. 
Impudent Barney, none of your blarney, 
Impudent Barney O'Hea. 
But as I 
was walking up Brandon street; 
Up Brandon street, up Brandon street, 
Just who do you think that myself should meet, 
But impudent Barney 0 
Hen. 
He said I 
looked kiln' : I 
called him a 
villain. 
And bid him, that minute, get out cf my way ! 
Ile said : I 
was joking ; ;: nd grinned so provoking, 
I 
couldn't help laughing at Barney 0-11-ea ; 
Impudent Barney, he has the blarney, 
Impudent Barney O'Hea. 
Tie knew ' twos all right when he saw me smile, 
lte saw me smile, he saw me smile ; 
For, he is the rogue up to ev'ry wile, 
lupudent Barney O'Hea 
He coaxed me to choose him : for, If I'd refuse him, 
lie swore he'd kill Cerney, the very next day, 
So, for fear ' twould go further, and just to s:ive murther, 
I 
think I 
must marry that mad-cap O'Hea; 
Bothering Barney, he has the blarney, 
To make a 
gill Mistress 
r-
.v.ADDY MILES. 
From the big town of Limerick lately I 
came, 
I 
left Ireland solely bekase of my name, 
For if anything whit wrong, or a 
mischief ' twas 
Shure they'd have all the blame on my mother's own eon. 
So my name now is Paddy O'Connor, 
'Pon an Irishman's thrue word and honor, 
Oh, misfortune my cuise light upon 
'Twas she christened in Paddy Miles. 
If a 
windy was Iwoke, or a 
hpuse robbed of tiles. 
And you'd ax who done that, shure they'd say Paddy Miles; 
Who was it set fire to his reverence's wig, 
And cut the tail of Pat Flanigan's pig. 
Who called Mishes Muloney a 
scollop, 
And gave Biddy McGee's cat the jaliop, 
Some blackguards would hit me a 
wollop, 
And say it was you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
worked in the bogs and behaved, as I 
thought, 
From my master Mick Flynn, a 
chtf ractz,r 
brought, 
But it done me no good, and I 
thought that was odd, 
So I 
made up my mind for to lea,
:-0 
the ° aid sod. 
For the devil a 
wan would employ MC, 
The girls there they would anni.
...y me, 
They threatened at once to destroy me 
All bekase I 
was called Paddy Miles. 
Who cut off one of the tails of Pat Finegan's coat, 
And who broke the left horn of Ned Shoughnessy's goat, 
Who through the back door to the chapel gct 
And drank all the wine, blood and ounds whyt a 
sin, 
Who half- murdered a 
poor-hoe 
inspector, 
And fired at a 
police detector, 
When Miss Fagan they tried to eject ha, 
Who was it, but you, Paddy Miles. 
I 
trotted to Dublin to look for a 
place, 
Tho' they'd ne'er saw me there, faix, they all low" vf %ea 
The jackeens kept calling meself to annoy, 
There's goes Paddy Miles, he's a 
Limerick boy. 
Till I 
flourish my sprig oi shillalah, 
An' smattered their gobs so genteelly. 
When the blood it began to flow freely, 
Said I, how do you like Paddy Miles. 
In short, lyq'ore long to this country I 
came, 
An' found Paddy Miles here was the same; 
If my name wasn't changed I 
was likely to starve, 
For bad luck to the master could I 
sarve. 
So Paddy O'Connor it is made, sir, 
An' if you want to get a 
smart blade, sir, 
Be my soul then you need not be afraid, air. 
For to hire me, no not Paddy Miles.

JUDY C.ARY. 
I 
came from Tipperary in search of Judy Cary, 
Where the boys are so merry, 
And the girls they are so free. 
She said she loved me dearly, 
Truly and sincerely, 
But one fine purty Summer's day 
She went away from me. 
CHORUS. 
Judy Cary, Judy Cary, 
How could you prove so contrairy, 
Judy Cary, Judy Cary, 
How could you treat your Barney so 
By the bogs in Tipperary, 
There lived Judy Carl; 
Although her income it was small 
Yet she was quite gray, 
She'd a 
father and a 
mother, 
And a 
mighty great big brother, 
I 
never thought till now, boys, 
That from me she'd run away. 
Judy Cary, eke 
Oh I 
tell me, have you seen her F 
You couldn't see a 
neater. 
She wears a 
red hood on her head 
And slippers on her feet. 
She was always light and airy, 
And could dance like any fairy, 
She's a 
beauty altogetl er, boys, 
I 
wish I 
now could see her. 
Judy Cary, dm. 
I've been up all the mountains, 
Near all the lakes and fountains, 
Looked into wells and water-butts, 
But her I 
cannot find. 
So as Pm in a 
plight, boys, 
I'll bid you all good night, boys; 
For the loss of my sweet colleen. 
I 
will die of grief I'm sure. 
Judy Cary, dzc. 
TEDDY McGLYNN 
FROM THE TOWN OF DUBLIN. 
Words and Music by H. MILLARD. 
I left me ould mother wid one little brother, 
And came to this country when scarcely a 
boy: 
And though I 
am Irish, and lived on the Parish, 
I'm first-cousin-german to Patrick Malloy, 
I 
came in short breeches that often lacked stitches, 
Had nails in me choes fit for horses to wear; 
Me mother'd not know me, but if you would show me, 
I'd quick know me mother and Dublin of yore. 
CHORUS 
rm Teddy McGlynn from the town of Dublin, 
And that is the name you will find on me door. 
I've worked, and I've waited, me brains I've berated; 
I've been to the schools, and to Lanigan's Ball; 
Me father was uncle to Kathleen Mavourneen; 
So l'm proud of me kindred, me mother, and alL 
But now I'm a 
lawyer, and feel like a 
warrior; 
I'll dance you the Lancers or jig, if you call. 
I've kept me shillelah, and own I'm most crazy 
To see me ould mother and Dublin once moi e. 
I'm Teddy McGlynn, &a. 
And soon I'll be goin' the truth to be knowiel 
And judge for meself 
ould Ireland's woes; 
If green I 
am wearing 
Shamrock is sharing 
The love in me lice 
or me country's repose. 
For light is now da• 
ng, and Liberty's morning 
Will shed its w 
ray on ould Ireland's shore! 
Then Katy I'll r ey, and no longer tarry 
To see me a 
mother and Dublin once more. 
Then Mister 
when at home in Dublin, 
Will welcome you all at his new cabin door. 
I've found many cronies amongst the Malonys, 
And often drank whiskey wid Phelim O'Toole ; 
O'Brien and McNielly and poor Miles O'Reilly, 
Were all of us sprung when we waked Tim McDout 
In the finest society, famed for sobriety, 
I'm welcomed with pride at each Fenian ball; 
I'll soon be an Alderman, like Jitiuny Flanagan, 
Who lives on Fifth Avenue, as good as them all. 
I'm Teddy McGlynn,

KILLA:13.NEY.--[CoNcLuDED.1 
Innisfallon's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh ; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glenn, Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span: 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bright-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair: 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the eharmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky. 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine : 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

I 
dreamt but last night, oh, bad luck to my dreaming! 
I'd die if I 
thought 't 
would come truly to pass— 
I 
dreamt, as the tears down my pillow were stealing, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass. 
011. didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing 
The thought of the grief was too deep to conceal. 
My mother cried, " Norah, child, what is your ailing?" 
But all I 
could utter was" Teddy O'Neal." 
I've been to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As nate a 
mud palace as ever was seen ; 
Although it did serve to keep poultry and pigs in 
I'm sure it was always most illegant clean. 
But now all about seems lonely and dreary; 
All sad, and all lonely, no piper, no reel, 
Not even the sun thro' the easement is cheery, 
Since 1 
left that dear darling, oh, Teddy O'NeaL 
Shall I 
ever forget when the big ship was ready? 
The moment had come when my love must depart; 
I 
cried like a 
spalpeen, " Good-bye to you, Teddy I " 
With drops on my cheek, and a 
stone at my heart„ 
He said ' twas to better his fortune he's roaming, 
But wh:tt would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he'd only come back to me, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own dear Teddy O'Neal,

N EW VERSION OF KATE O'SHANE. 
THERE'S a 
lass of beauty rare, 
With blue eyes and golden hair, 
One who meets me often in the shady lane; 
And she loves me well, I 
know, 
Though she never told me so, 
And I 
know I 
dearly love sweet Kate O'Shane. 
There's a 
charm about the gill, 
More than dainty eye or curl, 
More than all that lover's fancies may beguile; 
'Tis a 
good and loving heart, 
That from me will never part; 
I 
can read it in her happy, truthful smile. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
lass of beauty rare, 
With blue eyes and golden hair, 
One who meets me often in the shady lane; 
And she loves me well, I 
know, 
Though she never told me so, 
And I 
know I 
dearly love sweet Kate O'Shane. 
Come then sunshine, or come storm, 
There's a 
gentle fairy form, 
That will ever cheer life's path as forth we go; 
Conic then sadness, or come joy, 
There's peace without alloy 
For the hearts that ever trust each other so. 
Those blue eyes may gently fade, 
As we go down earth's fair glade, 
And the soft hair lose its tint of brightest gold; 
Yet along life's varied strand, 
As we wander hand in hand, 
We shall never, never let our hearts grow old. 
There's a 
lass, etc.
