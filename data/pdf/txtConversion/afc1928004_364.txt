SILLY BILL AND FATHER. 
Written, composed and arranged by HARRY BRAHAIL 
Oh! here I 
am, on father's back, 
I 
have no greater pleasure. 
Father's love will never lack, 
For I'm his only treasure. 
He lets me do what 'ere I 
please, 
And never lets me stumble; 
I 
sit here always at my ease, 
And yet he never grumbles. 
CHORUS. 
The boys they call me Silly Bill, 
But don't they tease me, rather, 
I 
never mean to walk until 
I 
get as big as father. 
When I 
was but six years old, 
My mother would say, Gaby, 
If you don't try and run alone, 
You'll drive your mammy crazy. 
When I 
grew up, in love I 
fell, 
With a 
pretty girl called Martha, 
Said she, I 
love you very well, 
But you mustn't bring your father, 
The boys, itc,

NAUGHTY MARY ANN. 
As sung by HARRY BRAHA31. 
Oh! naughty naked Cupid, 
With his little bow and arrow, 
Has settled me, who used to be 
As gay as a 
young cock-sparrow; 
Yes, once I 
was as happy 
As a 
Marquis or an Earl; 
But now I'm broken-hearted, 
All thro' a 
false young girl. 
CHORUS. 
Naughty Mary Ann, 
Naughty Mary Ann, 
How could you be so very unkind 
And false to your young man. 
Describe her beauty? 
No, I 
can't, 
And so I 
don't intend; 
The darling lived at a 
bonnet shop, 
In a 
street at the West end. 
I've stood so long in front of it, 
Her form to gaze upon; 
That once or twice a " bobby's" come 
And told me to move on. 
Nanghty Mary Ann, etc. 
She used to work there all the day, 
And then go home at night; 
I 
used to ' scort her to the door, 
Which I 
thought such delight; 
I 
told her how I 
loved her more 
Than a 
miser loves his gold; 
And I've waited for her in the rain, 
And caught a 
dreadful cold. 
Naughty Mary Ann, etc. 
With her dad I 
used to smoke my pipe, 
And I'd drink tea with her mother; 
'Twas settled in a 
month we should 
Belong to one another. 
So I 
bought the ring, and full of joy, 
To see her went one day, 
When they said a 
soldier'd been and gone, 
And taken her away. 
Naughty Mary Ann, etc. 
;72the'd known this soldier chap some time, 
Tho' she vow'd to be my wife; 
I 
hope if ever he goes to the wars, 
They'll frighten him out of his life. 
,For he and she have ruined me, 
I'm a 
poor unhappy man; 
Bad luck to all false females, and 
Bad luck to Mary Ann! 
Naughty Mary Ann, etc.

You Understand—At Least I 
Hope You Doi 
My friends say I'm w'wather slow, 
S'saying what I 
mean, you know, 
But I'll endeavor, 'fore I 
go, 
To make it c'elear for you; 
A 
little attention I 
must demand, 
Then I'm sure I'll safely land; 
My meaning n'now you understand— 
At least I 
t'trust you do. 
CHORUS. 
I 
may not, perhaps, express myself 
C'clearly unto you; 
But then, of course, you understand, 
At I'least I 
hope you do. 
A 
girl I 
know, called Patti Gray, 
Says I 
never know w'i,vliat to say, 
Altho' I 
see her every day, 
My w'words are always so few. 
Near her I 
scarcely can sit or stand. 
But gaze on her and sq'squeeze her hand. 
Li'like this, I 
trust you understand— 
Of course I 
se'see you do. 
I 
may not, etc. 
I 
squoze her hand the other day, 
Said she was like a 
f' Hower in May. 
And asked her if she would name the day, 
To make o'one of us t'two. 
She answered haughtily and so grand— 
"What claim have you, sir, to my hand?" 
Then l'looked like this, you understand— 
No doubt all of you d'do. 
I 
may not, etc. 
I 
said, " I 
don't claim anything, 
I 
merely wish the belle to ring;" 
1 
thought I'd said a 
funny thing, 
Though she didn't laugh, that's true; 
But answered in tones so s'sweet and bland— 
••4 
Nfy heart's engaged and so s 
my hand. 
And se you can go, you understand ?" 
I 
said, " 1 
th'think I 
do." 
I 
may not, etc. 
I'm seeking for a 
wife to-night, 
Though not, good looking, I'm no fright; 
You'll find me honest and upright, 
L'loving, k'kind and t'true. 
She mustn't expect to d'do the grand, 
For I've no carriages or rand; 
I've only myself, you understand— 
Of course I 
se'see you do. 
SPOKEN.— I've only got a 
co'comfortable income enough for 
two 
So _f 
any lady here is inclined to try m'matrimony, now's 
the time 
if she don't like me after we're married, she can g'go 
home again 
I 
can't say fairer. 
She can have her choice as to 
where she'll live, either Shoreditch or Trafalgar Sq'Square, or 
some other watering place, I'm nut selfish. 
She mustn't say, 
if I 
come home late, " You might have come home sooner." I 
hate that. 
And if I 
want a 
b'button sewed on a 
shirt, she 
mustn't say she's out of b'buttons.. I 
hate people to say they're 
out of b'buttons 
She mustn't grumble if I 
let a 
friend stay to supper now and 
then, and say there's n'not enough for three. 
I 
hate when 
there's not enough for three. 
In fact, by what I've said, I 
hope you know the sort of w'wife I 
want. 
I 
may not, etc.

ONCE I 
HAD CASH, 
As sung by HARRY BitiotAm. 
You'll excuse my appearing so seedy and sad, 
But the fact is my garments have gone to the bad; 
They once were the fashion, the smartest e'er worn, 
Now fit for a 
scarecrow, all tattered and torn, 
A 
short time ago Lcame into some cash, 
Like others, alasf I 
went in for the dash ! 
I 
lived like a 
lord, my chink soon did..spend, 
A 
short, tho' a 
merry time, this is the end! 
CHORUS. 
Once I 
had cash, and then I 
was rash, 
Cut such a 
dasli, soon went to.smash ! 
Now, you may see, I'm all up 
tree." 
! 
fools and their money's soon parted. 
I 
then used to toddle to -ball- room and rout, 
If I 
now showed my nose, they would usher me out, 
And those I've befriended in sunnier day, 
Now give me cold shoulder, pass over the way; 
This hat I 
have doffed to many a 
fair maid, 
Now the brim wouldn't stand it of the roof I'm afraid. 
These gloves, once the beautiful, fit fora Don! 
Are so torn and tender, they scarce will keep on. 
Once I 
had cash, & c. 
I'd a 
gold-beaded cane, which I'd twirl in my hand, 
In its place I've a 
small card, you Wraps understand ? 
An eye-glass, an air of importance would lend, 
Long ago I 
for safety, left that with " a 
friend." 
In a 
hansom I 
then gaily rode down the street, 
Now I 
tramp it, not handsome about my poor feet, 
These boots, once superb in both style and best leather, 
They scarce now can body and sole keep together. 
Once I 
had cash, & c. 
•S 
This sleeve still possesses for me a 
sweet charm, 
When I 
think of the ladies I' had on my arm, 
This old coat could tell a 
good tale I 
believe, 
But one tail I 
find's given notice to ieave, 
The wind thro' my " Sydenhams," so gently does steal, 
And nothing but holes in their pockets I 
feel, 
They've clung to me well, so I'll still hold them dear, 
Tho' patches, alas! may be found in the rear. 
Once I 
had cash, & c. 
And as for the garment I 
wear next my skin, 
To be " shirty " with that, after years, would be sin. 
I 
could once " shoot my linen," so spotlessly white, 
But now I'm thinking twere best out of sight. 
So, friends, should some cash ever come in ) our wa7, 
Stick to it in case of a 
rainy day; 
Take care of yourself, and mind, don't be too free. 
Or some day you'll find yourself right up a 
tree. 
CHORUS. 
When you have cash, never be rash: 
Don't cut 
dash, or you'll go to smash! 
And the ' ik ) me you'll be quite up a 
tree, 
When you and your money's once parted.

Sung by HARRY BRAHAM. 
Now, when I 
was a 
sprightly youth, 
I'd such a 
taking way, 
For anything would vanish if 
On it my hands I 
lay. 
I'd prig my playmate's marbles, 
If he cried I'd punch his head, 
And now by—ahem! sharp practice 
I 
get my daily bread. 
SPOKEN.—W ell, if people permit that kind of thing, all I

Three pounds each mortal week, 
Can easily be realized 
If only me they seek. 
Of course it's all per letter, 
And they forwards me their " tin," 
And after waiting a

Find out they're taken in.

make 
My book upon " the ground; 
But when the race is over 
I'm very seldom found, 
rarely seek my " clients," 
But should we meet again, 
Sometimes they have the awful " nerve" 
To ask me to explain. 
SPOKEN.—Explain;

What do you say, sir? 
I 
laid you five to one—I 
laid you—well— 
It's a

I'm rather fond of widows, who 
Have got a

I'm certain sure to win. 
I 
vow eternal love until 
They name the happy day, 
By then I've borrowed a

So takes myself away. 
SPOKEN.—Some of you might say, such conduct as that was 
werry ungentlemanly and werry improper. 
Is it, is it, IS IT? 
Well— 
It's a 
good job, Ize.

There's Another Good Man Gone Wrong. 
As sung by HARRY BHAHAM. 
Of sayings that are old and new, 
A good stock I 
have heard, 
That well apply to many things, 
Both solemn and absurd 
But still, the best of all, I 
think, 
The subject of my song, 
Though please don't ' round on me and say: 
"There's another good man gone wrong." 
CHORUS. 
There's another good man gone wrong, 
There's another good man gone wrong; 
How oft' you'll hear that speech severe, 
There's another good man gone wrong! 
In coming down the street to-day, 
I 
noticea neighbor Spare, 
Reclining in the gutter, with 
his heels high in the air: 
he'd two black eyes, a 
broken nose, 
Around him was a 
throng, 
I 
could not help remarking then, 
" 
There's another good man gone wrong." 
SPOKEN.—Very good sort of chap was Spare, but he married 
widow and very naturally took to drink; 
they always do, 
....encver I 
see a 
case of that kind I 
always say — 
There's another good man, & c. 
At home I 
am the quietest chap, 
And rows I 
never raise, 
Altho' I 
own I 
cannot bear 
The thought of washing days; < 
But last week I 
had such a 
ro*, 
We went at it ding dong, 
Until the neighbors shouted out: 
" 
There's another good man gone wrong." 
SPOKE:C.—I banged the furniture about, smashed fourteen 
plates, two cups and a 
soup tureen, threw the baby's cradle 
into the fire, burned my wife's chignon, and' all the neighbors 
cried out— 
There's another good man, &c. 
We had the brokers in last month, 
At least we'd only one, 
But he had appetite for six, 
When feeding he'd begun; 
To pay him out I 
took my watch 
To pawn it for a 
song, 
But " uncle," when I 
showed it, said: 
"There's another good man gone wrong." 
SPOKEN.—I 
asked him only two pounds on it, but before I 
knew where I 
was I 
found myself kicked out in the street, and 
the pawnbroker remarking " Why, the works ain't fit for a 
mangle," while all the little boys cried— 
There's another good man, &e. 
• 
Some slight advice I 
tender you, 
Before I 
take my leave, 
And that it is of value, you 
Will readily conceive: 
Be careful as you go through life, 
To work with vigor strong, 
Then folks will ne'er have cause to say: 
"There's another good man gone wrong." 
There's another good man, Sre 
As Sung by HARRY BRAIIA.M. 
Some people are rather annoying, at times, 
Some people are fond of a 
hoax, 
Some people do things without reason or rhyme, 
And play off their practical jokes. 
I'm a 
good-tempered fellow, whatever occurs, 
I 
take all in good part—but when— 
They come it too strong, I 
am bound to observe: 
If you please now "don't do that again." 
CHORUS. 
Don't do that again now—don't do that again! 
I 
hope you will excuse me if I 
speak a 
little plain. 
I 
never lose my temper, nor into a 
passion rush 
But don't do that again or you'll annoy me very much! 
I'm courting a 
darling, a 
brother she's got, 
Who puts knives and forks in my pocket. 
Sometimes when my darling and I 
are alone, 
He'll shut the room door, yes! and lock it! 
Sticks pins in my chair, so when I 
sit down 
I 
rise up again in some pain. 
I'd box his young ears if I 
dare, but I 
daren't, 
So I 
say please " don't do that again.' 
Don't do that, &c. 
II 
any one's wanting an object for fun, 
Or for—vulgarly speaking—a 
spree, 
t 
may appear strange, hut remarkably true, 
They're certain to pitch upon me! 
Leave me the wrong hat; take my umbrella, 
Of course when it's pouring with rain! 
I 
get wild—but what can I 
say to a 
fella, 
But please now " don't do that again." 
Don't do that, &c. 
While walking along t'other day in the street, 
A 
fellow first trod on my toes! 
Then put up his fist, and commencing to fight, 
He struck me a 
blow on the nose 
Then said, I 
beg pardon, I've made a 
mistake, 
I 
took you for a 
fellow named Ben1 
I 
wish " Ben" had got it, I'm sure, for my sake, 
So I 
said: Well—" don't do that again." 
Don't do that, &e. 
Last summer, while taking my dip in the sea, 
Some mischievous frolicsome spark 
Was on for some fun, of course he chose me! 
And ran off with my clothes for a 
lark, 
So I 
had to stop in, for I 
dare not comae out, 
While stones from small boys caused me poin. 
And when he came back I 
could but look black, 
And beg he'd not do it again. 
SPOKEN.—Of course he apologized, and what can you do 
when a 
fellow apologizes? 
You can only say— 
Don't do that, &c.

MAJOR DE VOY, 
Sung by HARRY BRAHAM. 
I'm Major de Voy of the Carbineers, 
Beloved by all the charming dears; 
How many fair creatures l've left in tears, 
In love with the handsome Major. 
My wife is as jealous as can be, 
She thinks there's no husband alive like me; 
And certainly I 
think she has cause to be 
Conceited about her Major. 
CHORUS. 
For Major de Voy is such a 
fascinating boy, 
He still the dear ladies bewitches: 
Tho' I'm sorry to say he can't have his own way, 
For Mrs. De Voy wears the breeches. 
some time ago I 
went out to dine, 
With my wife (of course) dress'd out so fine. 
A 
beautiful dinner and splendid wine, 
Set out for the gallant Major. 
Some elegant ladies I 
met there, 
One in particular—extra fair; 
I 
was flirting with her, when a 
voice near my chair, 
In a 
sepulchral tone cried " Major!" 
SPOKEN.—It wat_ my wife! 
It is very disagreeable when you 
are caught flirting by your wife. 
I 
say, when you are inter-
rupted in a 
quiet flirtation by your wife it is very disagreeable. 
But my wife is so jealous, you know--
For Major de Vey, etc. 
• 
She engages the ugliest servant girls, 
With high cheek bones and corkscrew curls; 
And teeth that you cannot, with truth, call pearls, 
To wait on the gallant Major. 
My partner for life was my own choice, 
And in my bett er half I 
rejoice; 
She's quite eighteen stone with a 
baritone voice, 
And doats on her handsome Major. 
17 
SPOKEN.—It is very disagreeable when a 
wife is too fond of 
her husband. I 
say when a 
wife displays an extra amount of 
affection toward her husband, it is very disagreeable. 
I 
cannot 
leave the room to—to—wash my hands, but she follows me, 
and waits ' till I'm done. 
It's very disagreeable, but she's so 
jealous you know. 
For Major de Voy, etc. 
If I 
want to go out, I 
must ask my wife, 
To prevent a 
day of storm and strife; 
It is disagreeable, 'pon my life, 
To a 
man like the gallant Major. 
One evening I 
seized on a 
good time, 
Her temper all day had been quite sublime; 
asked her to take me to some pantomime,. 
When didn't she scold her Major. 
SPOKEN.—Quite a scene I assure you—a transformation 
scene. 
Very disagreeable to have a 
transformation scene in 
a 
drawing-room. " Major," said she, " You ask me to take 
you to see the pantomime; you ought to be ashamed of your-
self. 
You know you only want to go and see the 
legs" 
" 
Well, my dear.?' I 
said, " there is nothing at all disagreeable 
in a 
nice leg and foot, I 
say, when a 
pretty girl displays a 
hand-
some pair of limbs, encased In silken hose, there is nothing 
about them very cliszigroeable, never mind what the Lord Chun. 
18 
berlain may say. " Major," she said, " you shan't go." " Very 
good, my dear, then I 
can stay at home. I 
say I 
can remain at 
home!" " Major, instead of going to see the pantomime, you 
can run ' round to Mrs. Prickletoe and ask her to come and have 
tea with us." 
" 
My dear, I 
said, "I 
will go to Mrs. Prickletoe, but I 
cannot 
run round,—I 
say, I 
will go and invite the lady, but run I 
can-
not." " Major," she said, "that's your unkind spirit prompts you 
to answer me thus,—You can't run, you can't do this, you can't 
do that,—you cant do anything." 
It is very disagreeable to be 
told by your wife that you can't do anything.—I 
say, when you 
are told by your wife that you do not possess the ability to ac-
complish anything, it is very disagreeable. " I 
merely said,— 
my dear, I 
can't run ' round, when you immediately say, I 
can't 
do this, I 
can't do that I 
can't do anything; You must bear in 
mind that I 
am not so nimble as I 
was, I 
cannot show so much 
agility. I 
will walk around and invite Mrs. Prickletoe, as I 
con-
sider her a 
very agreeable party." " Major," she said, 
Mrs. 
Prickletoe shall not come I That was because I 
said I 
thought 
the lady a 
nice woman; very disagreeable, was it not ? 
But she's so jealous you know. 
For Major de Voy,

Down come fence, Nigger Wench and all! 
Let my people go. 
Way down in, Jcs.

Let my people go; 
Take my advice, young man, go West

Let my people go; 
And when you get full you've got no sense! 
Let my people go.

CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY, 
As sung by HARRY BRAHAM. 
My name is not Smith, nor Brown, nor Jones, 
Tell that much,. I 
don't mind, 
And as for my address—p'raps some 
Would much like that to find; 
Some dads leave houses to their sons, 
Mine ne'er left me a 
brick, 
And so, just like my watch, by Jove, 
I 
always go on " tick." 
SPOKEN.—" Tick," that's the word, rather undignified per-
haps, but doosedlY convenient, besides— 
Cifours. 
It's a 
custom of the country, 
A 
custom of .the country, 
It's a 
custom of the country, 
And a 
useful custom, too. 
To jolly festive parties 
I 
oft' get an invite, 
If once a 
fellow " pals on" here, 
Of him I 
ne'er lose sight; 
t 
live with him forever, 
No matter how it looks, 
And sometimes I 
contrive to get 
Upon his tailor's books. 
SPOKEN — Get the name of his tailor and introduce yourself. 
Got a 
fine rig out the other day. 
When sent home Tailor fella 
says, " Our terms are for cash." I 
said, " Indeed ! 
well 'spose 
you ' put it down' this time." 
lie says, " We don't ' put it 
down' at our establishment, sir." 
No? then stick it up." 
He 
says, ","
.-
We don't 
stick it up,' neither," " No? then it's time 
you began, for— 
CHORUS. 
It's a 
custom of the country, 
A 
custom of the country, 
It's a 
custom of the country, 
And a 
useful custom, too. 
28 
When things get rather warm in town, 
To Brighton down I 
run, 
Give the Parade a " doing," 
And have some glorious fun; 
I'm sure to meet with some one, 
ho's got more cash than brain, 
And while he's got a 
Fiver left, 
With him will I 
remain. 
SPOKEN,--I
'll never desert a 
friend— while he's a 
Fiver left, 
Eat his dinners for him, ride his horse for him, go for a 
sail— 
No I I 
will not do that, I 
don't admire that at all, I 
am so 
queer, owing to that confounded— 
Cuonus. 
Custom of the country, 
A custom of the country, 
It's a 
custom of this country, 
An unpleasant custom, too. 
Somehow I 
always csn get on 
The right side of the girls; 
For flattery is to them, often 
Sweeter far than pearls; 
Of course I 
don't mean anything, 
But flirt with all I 
can, 
They say I'm awfully wicked, and 
A 
naughty sad young man. 
SPOKEN.—Especially when I 
get 'em all under the mistletoe 
at Christmas, and help myself— 
rr 
24 
CHORUS. 
To the custom of the country, 
The custom of the country, 
To the custom of the country. 
A glorious custom too. 
I'm looking for a 
wife—but she 
Must have a 
pile of cash; 
She can play at housekeeping, 
While I 
can cut a 
dash 
While she lets me do as I 
please, 
We're certain to agree; 
So If there's one that's up to that, 
Let her apply to me! 
SPOKEN.—We'd be so happy, at least I 
should, and should 
we be blessed with rosy cherubs— I 
said "SHOULD we." 
It's a 
moral certainty, because— 
CHORUS. 
It's a 
custom of the country, 
A 
custom of the country, 
It's a 
A custom of the country, 
And a 
happy custom, too.

OH, WHERE IS THAT JONES? 
As sung by HARRY BRAHAM. 
If I 
seem somewhat excited, 
Well, I 
trust I'll be excused, sir, 
My faith and hospitality's 
Been shamefully abused, sir; 
My Angeline—my only child— 
On whom I 
fondly hoped, 
has driven her father frantic, wild! 
The baggage—she's eloped. 
CHORUS. 
On, where's that Jones? 
If I 
catch that Jones, 
I'm sure there will be slaughter; 
Take all I've got—I'd not care a 
jot, 
But don't take an old man's daughter. 
Fool that I 
was! I 
let my child, 
The coxcomb introduce, sir, 
And from that fatal moment, 
He has played the very deuce, sir. 
He'd what those chits of girls would call, 
A 
fascinating manner; 
He'd sing namby-pamby love songs, 
While my child played the " pianer." 
Oh, where's that Jones, etc. 
My girl got so affected, and 
So sad and queer her tones, sir, 
If but a 
day elapsed without 
Her seeing her dear Jones, sir; 
He'd come to dinner, stay to tea, 
Play chess till lote at night; 
That she should leave her dad for Tones, 
You'll own was hardly right. 
Oh, where's that Jones, etc. 
Yesterday morn I 
waited, 
To receive her morning kiss, sir, 
She did not come as usual, 
Something I 
feared amiss, sir, 
Before me laid a 
little note, 
Which froze my poor old bones— 
She hoped I 
would forgive her, 
For she'd run away with Jones. 
Oh, 
,s that Jones, etc. 
As sung by HARRY BRAHA.M. 
I'm in a 
deal of trouble, yes! 
The cause of it's you see, 
There's some confounded fellow, who 
The image is of me. 
My Christian appelation's James, 
The other fellow's Jim; 
And they're always taking him for me, 
Or else take me for him. 
CHORUS. 
But only let me catch him, 
By jingo if I 
catch him, 
Oh, shouldn't I 
like to catch him, 
That fellow who looks like me. 
When out I'm often stopped, and asked 
Some long account to pay, 
And tho' I 
tell them " Im not him," 
They don't care what I 
say, 
Whilst walking with the girl I 
love, 
Alas! I'd not gone far, 
When a 
woman brings her babe to me, 
And says " there! kiss your pa!" 
SPOKEN.—A splendid joke that—before one's affianced too! 
said " Remove this infant immediately." " Oh," said she, 
"Don't be cross, Jim!" 
Oh! only let me, etc 
I 
was strolling out the other day, 
In peaceful frame of mind, 
When I 
received, to my dismay, 
A 
terrible blow behind; 
4W: 
To see whom my assailant was, 
Of course I 
soon turned 'round, 
When my nose ran up against a 
fist, 
And I 
went on the ground. 
SPOKEN.—To 
find an old gentleman in a 
towering, saying 
" 
You rascal! how dare you make love to my daughter?" " Me, 
it's not me! 
It must be that other fellow, Jim "— 
Oh! only let me, etc. 
27 
'Twas only yesterday I 
called, 
To see my intended bride; 
When, oh! she told me such a 
tale, 
I 
thought I 
should have died. 
For when she opened the door she stared, 
As I 
gave her lips a 
smack, 
Said she—" why, what has happened, dear, 
And what has brought you back ?" 
" 
Brought me back, love? Why I 
haven't seen you for two 
whole days." " You haven't ?" says she. " Well, then, some-
one the image of you's been here a kissing me"—that Jim 
again— 
Oh, only let me, etc. 
Of course I'd like to marry, but 
really feel afraid, 
For fear some very awkward kind of 
Mistakes might be made. 
I 
must linger in my misery, 
Anxiety and woes, 
Until this " other fellow"—" Jim," 
Turns up his wretched toes. 
CHORUS. 
But only let me catch him, 
By jingo if I 
catch him, 
Oh, shouldn't I 
like to catch him, 
That fellow that looks like me,

POETICAL ETTIE. 
As Sung by THE BRAHMA& 
I'm a 
very romantic young lady, 
On poetry fondly I 
doat. 
I'm fond of nooks, quiet and shady, 
And Byron incessantly quote— 
And Byron incessantly quote. 
My friends, ev'ry one, say I'm pensive, 
(Tho' I'm never oppress'cl with ennui,) 
And they say that they feel apprehensive 
Lest perchance I 
an old maid should be. 
CHORUS. 
I'm known as poetical Ettie, 
As I 
stroll on the beach or the jetty; 
And to ev'ry kind friend, 
Such sweet sonnets I 
send, 
So charming, so graceful and pretty. 
I 
write for the " Family Herald," 
Short stanzas and verses, at times; 
And though I've not the wit of a 
Jerrold, 
I'm never deficient in rhymes; 
I'm never deficient in rhymes. 
I 
oft write a 
sonnet or ditty, 
'Bout moonlight and sweet silv'ry streams; 
They are certainly not very witty. 
But I 
always avoid two extremes. 
CHORUS. 
I'm known as Poetical Ettie, 
And verses I 
oft send to Betty; 
But somehow I 
find 
They are thankfully declin'd— 
And yet they are all very pretty. 
Some may think, who a.r. given to mocking, 
" 
Those girls of the Period" I 
mean; 
That just because I'm a 
blue stocking, 
I'm in slang parlance " awfully green"— 
I'm in slang parlance " awfully green." 
In that case, they're certainly rushing 
To erroneous conclusions, I 
think; 
If they fancy because I 
am gushing, 
I 
am always bedabbled with ink. 
I'm known as, Ic.e. 
Now, I'm certain, although I'm romantic, 
And what lit'rary men call a " blue," 
I'm by no means stuck up or pedantic, 
And no one can say I'm a 
shrew; 
And no one can say I'm a 
shrew. 
Then there's one fact I 
have not yet stated. 
It may sound rather strange, but 'tis true, 
That I'm perfectly domesticated, 
I 
can make bread, and bake, boil, or brew. 
I'm known as, dr,s. 
I've a 
heart that is loving and tender, 
And sub rosa, between me and you, 
I 
wish I'd a 
noble defender, 
To answer an unkind review; 
To answer an unkind review. 
For those critics give me such a 
slating, 
They declare I 
am not a " true blue ;" 
But that question it's no use debating, 
4.1049' I'm not yet Seventy-two. 
For I'm known as, 46t •

I'M STILL A 
FRIEND TO YOU. 
(AwswEn To " You've Been a 
Friend to Me.") 
As Sung by ED. SCULLY. 
Ah! years have come and gone, dear Tom, 
The past seems like a 
dream, 
When you and I 
together met 
By the winding stream. 
When hand in hand we promised, Tom, 
To each we would be true; 
Old time has made no change in me, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
CHOIIIIB. 
I'm still a 
friend to you, dear Tom, 
Alas! there are but few 
Have ever been as kind and true, 
As I 
have been to you. 
How often have I 
wept, dear Tom, 
When thinking o'er the joys 
The happy scenes of long ago, 
When you and I 
were boys; 
But now I'm told, you're very poor, 
Your days in life are few ; 
It gives me joy to meet you, Tom, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
I'm still a 
friend, &c. 
Old friendship often withers, Tom, 
Whene'er a 
man grows poor; 
The rich and proud forget old friends, 
And know them then no more; 
But keep that honest heart of yours, 
We'll make old friendship new; 
I 
care not what the world may say, 
I'm still a 
friend to you. 
I'm still a 
friend, &a,

I 
MET HER IN THE DELL. 
As sung by HARRY W ESTERN, at Tony Pastors. 
Air—The Briar. 
WHILE strolling by a 
cottage door, 
To watch the girls so fair, 
I 
fell in love with a 
black-eyed girl, 
Her name was Kitty Claire. 
I've just received a 
letter, 
From the maid I 
love so well, 
She set my heart a 
twitching, 
When I 
met her in the dell— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, don't I 
love this black-eyed girl 
Of her I 
love to tell, 
I 
loved her first then kissed her, 
When I 
met her in the dell. 
I'm going to see that girl to-night. 
And tell her of my love. 
I 
know she's waiting for me now, 
She is my turtle dove. 
When I 
am married to her, 
I'll come again and tell 
You more about this black-eyed girl.

THE SOLDIER'S FAREWELL. 
As Sung by Tun BRARAms. 
I'm going to wring your tender hearts, 
So ladies all prepare; 
Get ready your pocket-handkerchiefs, 
And let down your back hair ! 
Oh 
I 
doated on such a 
darling, 
Who intended me to wed— 
I'm certain of that, but don't you see, 
He had to say instead— 
CHORUS. 
" 
Good-bye, love, Oh! I'm bound to march away, 
Gpod-bye, dear, 1'11 come another day j 
• 
One embrace, then right about face !" 
T 
hen off they march away! 
For many a 
day when on parade, 
I 
noticed with what ease 
The word of command he understood; 
" 
Attention—staad—and freeze 1" 
Oh! 
We meant to have settled down upon 
His thirteen pence a 
day! 
But duty, you know, is everything, 
And so he had to say— 
" 
Good-bye, love," &A. 
It's very 
nwrong for girls to love 
A 
soldier, it is plain; 
They've only time to break our hearts! 
Then off they are again, oh! 
Now mine was a 
dear who could make love— 
At courtship quite au fait! 
But just at the interesting part, 
He always had to say— 
" 
Good-bye, love," &c: 
K. C. B.! 
Sung with immense success by THE BRkHAMS. 
My love he was a 
Farmer, 
But now he's gone away; 
He's gone to join the army, 
For one and a 
penny a 
day. 
He's tired of agricultural life, 
And says that he'll obtain 
The highest honor to be had, 
Ere he returns again. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to join the army, 
And a 
soldier he will be. 
A 
Corporal, a 
Sergeant, 
Or an A. D. C. 
A 
Captain, or a 
Colonel, 
Or a 
something else, you see, 
He'll never rest ' till he becomes 
A K.C.B. 
He's thrown aside the hoe and rake, 
Likewise the spade and plow; 
To all such occupations 
He never means to bow. 
His soul's so full of ardor, 
All danger he does scorn, 
And now he sighs for fields of war, 
Instead of fields of corn. 
He's gone, ,Itc. 
I 
told him he was foolish 
To go and leave the farm, 
For I 
should break my heart 
If e'er he came to harm. 
But still he is devoted 
In love to me, you see, 
And when he is promoted, 
Then he will marry me. 
He's gone, Sr.c. 
I'd. Like to be a 
Little Boy Again. 
As Sung by THE BEAHAMS. 
0! when I 
was a 
little boy 
I 
was not very big; 
I 
used to walk on hands and knees, 
As fat as a 
little pig. 
My rnammy'd squeeze me in her arms, 
And say I 
was her joy; 
By jingo, they were jolly times, 
When I 
was a 
little boy. 
Cnoaus. 
Oh I 
when I 
was a 
little boy, 
A " sweet" little boy, a " dear" little boy 
'Tween you and me rd like to be 
A 
little boy again. 
When I 
was sleepy they would " lay 
Me in my litle bed :" 
If I 
fell down how they would run 
To rub my little head. ' 
They'd give me di urns and sugar plums, 
Which I 
would much enjoy; 
But now, they'd let me break my neck, 
'Cause I'm not a 
little boy. 
So I'd like to be, SA. 
They'd give me pretty rides; and oh! 
So pretty they would talk; 
But nate, I 
find that whenever I 
want 
To ride, I 
have to walk. 
'87 
Then I 
used to kiss what girls I 
liked, 
They never, then, seemed coy— 
If I 
did so now I'd get a 
month, 
'Cause I'm not a 
little boy. 
So I'd like to be, &c. 
They'd give me all I 
fancied, 
There was nothing too good in the town; 
And an uncle often gave me 
A 
glorious brand new crown: 
But now I 
may fancy what I 
please, 
Want of cash my wants destroy, 
And there's many an " uncle's" lent me a 
crown, 
Since I 
was a 
little boy. 
I'd like to be, Szc. 
I 
used to fish in our water butt, 
With some cotton and a 
pin, 
And now and then ; would contrive 
Head first to tumble in: 
And then my dear old dad would come, 
And some time he would employ, 
For he'd go and he'd G•et a 
nice little stick 
And he'd wallop his little boy. 
Crionus. 
Yes, then I 
was a 
little boy, 
A 
sore little boy, a 
raw little boy ; 
But, 'tween you and me, I'd like to be 
A 
little boy again.

WHEN WE MET AT THE BALL 
The sole property of Miss LIZZIE Busa&m. 
Waltzing with cousin at the ball last night. 
One face this heart set beating, 
Whose form so fair, it dazzled quite 
This heart, this heart, when first we met ; 
And as my fond pulsations like a 
torrent heaved.. 
My bosom's echo's fondly beat; 
Oh would, as full of anguish, 
I 
were from love, from love relieved. 
CHORUS. 
For his face is fair, 
His form is rare, 
My love—sweet dove 
Our hearts combine. 
No power I 
fear 
If he is near; 
Through life— 
A 
true wife— 
Me he will find. 
They told me that his heart was taken 
With one more proud, more gay, 
But still my love it was not shaken, 
For with him, night seemed turned to c
-lay. 
And as nis silver voice so softly plead 
Or whispered—whispered in mine ear. 
A 
spell, as if by magic, 
Would lisp his name, so dear to me. 
For his face is fair, tte 
And true love conquers all; 
But still there's hope while life remains, they say, 
The darker be the night, the brighter day. 
Oh! darling Cupid, though thou art small, 
Be herald for thy mistress, and be sure 
Thou fill'st him with true love's alarms, 
And bring, oh! bring him. angel Cupid, 
Yes, bring him back unto these arms. 
For his face is fair, &c.

What if days of sorrow greet us, 
Sunny hours will soon be found. 
Can we e'er forget the gladness 
That has bloom'd for you and me? 
Chide me not, but whisper sweetly— 
Have I

THE NAUGHTY YOUNG MAN, 
As Sung by THE BRARAMS. 
Pon my life I'm so dreadfully naughty, 
I'm always at some naughty act; 
I 
don't want to startle you ladies, 
By stating so well known a 
fact. 
In confidence, mind, it's a 
secret, 
You'll keep it—I 
know ladies cau— 
1 
am, oh! I 
am, though I 
say it, 
I 
am such a 
naughty young man. 
CHORUS. 
Pon my life, now, I'm dreadfully naughty, 
Oh! so naughty—very naughty; 
And the ladies ! twist sixteen and forty, 
Say I 
am such a 
naughty young man. 
I 
once took my Grandma to Greenwich, 
She paid for the shrimps and the tea; 
But then we gay naughty young fellows, 
Do love, so, a 
deuce of a 
spree; 
We didn't get home till past seven— 
The evening was growing quite dark, 
Mamma was so anxious about us— 
But then we fast boys love a 
lark! 
SPOEM—I was always of a 
fast turn of mind; I 
go in for 
glorious dissipation, keep white mice and silk-worms— 
the silk-worms are fast too—I 
met one of them on tha 
stairs this morning, ha! ha! I 
love a 
joke, but then— 
Pon my life, now, &e.

I've a 
cousin, and she's Uncle's daughter, 
I 
took her out once for a 
walk, 
You'd really have thought we were lovers, 
To judge from our looks and our talk; 
She into a 
pastry-cook's, took me, 
And I 
had two tarts and an ice; 
And that you'll admit's dissipation, 
And filling besides, at the price. 
SPOKEN.—I 
made a 
splendid joke in the shop when 
they opened the lemonade and the cork popped, I 
said 
" 
that's popping the question." and she said: 
Oh! you 
naughty young man— 
Pon my life, now, Szc. 
At " Kiss in the Ring" I'm considered, 
A 
naughty young man for the work; 
And at that fast game '• Hunt the Slipper,"

I'LL TAKE A 
DAY OFF AND FIND OUT. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT for SAM DEVERE. 
I'm going to sing of an odd little phrase, 
Of which you have heard, I've no doubt; 
Ask your friends any question, their answer will be 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
You'll hear this expression each day in the week, 
In the town, If you're roaming about, 
And every one's gone on this quaint little speech— 
" 
I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
CHORES. 
There's many flash sayings in use now-a-days, 
You'll hear them while strolling about; 
But the strangest of all things I've heard is just this— 
" 
I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
A man falls in love with a 
pretty young girl; 
And is anxious to make her his bride; 
His money he spends taking her out at night, 
Or out on the road for a 
ride. 
He's " giving her taffy," the young men all say, 
His wardrobe is all " up the spout;" 
When he asks her to marry, her answer will be: 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
There's many flash sayings, kc. 
If you go out at night and get fearfully tight, 
And try to be one of the gang, 
The chances are great that you'll get in a 
fight, 
And some one will give you a 
bang, 
And when it is morning, you're taken to court, 
And the judge asks what you were about, 
If you don't answer quick, why he surely will say: 
"I'll give you six months to find out." 
There's many flash sayings, Scc. 
The great events of the past year, my friends, 
Were the stealing of young Charlie Ross, 
The trial of Beecher, who still wants to pray, 
And the flight of the once famous " Boss." 
And no one can tell where sweet William has gone— 
In fact, it's a 
matter of doubt; 
But if you are anxious to know where he is, 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
There's many flash say'

THE OLD KENTUCKY SHORE. 
Written, composed and sung with great SUCC4103 by 
KIRK & DREW, at Deagle's. 
Oh! here we are, as you can see, 
To sing and dance for you; 
Just watch our gymnastic feats, 
And our easy style, so new. 
We're going back to our southern homes, 
Where oft we've been before. 
We'll show you what we used to do 
On de old Kentucky shore. 
CHORUS. 
And when at night our work was done, 
Oh! that's the time our work was done, 
To see de coon and 'possum run, 
As often we did do. 
Those happy days have passed and gone, 
Dey'll never come no more; 
When we were happy little darks, 
In those sunny days of yore. 
Our father and mother they've both gone 
To dat happy golden door. 
Dey left us when two little darks,. 
On de old Kentucky shore. 
And when at night, &c.

I 
know a 
pretty blue-eyed maid, 
The sweetest of them all. 
I'd tell her name, but I 
dare not, 
I 
met her in the fall, 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
She blushed and hung her head. 
My heart it beat with rapture, 
I 
thought that I 
was dead. 
CHORUS. 
She's beautiful, 
She's fairer than them all. 
I'll ne'er forget 
The day I 
met • 
My loved one, in the fall. 
(spa.) 
Those days have passed, and happy ones; 
We're married now for life. 
ne'er forget the day 
I 
asked her for my wife. 
She blushed and smiled and hung her head, 
She was the fairest of them all. 
I 
don't regret 
The day I

My loved one, in the Fall. 
She's beautiful, ezc. (Dew)

THE NOBBY LITTLE OOP, 
Written expressly for MISS ALECIA JOURDAN (words and (mt1. 
sic) by J. F. &MIMIC 
At a 
glance you can see what I 
am, 
The style of my dress tells you that, 
My number is 4-2-1, 
My name it is—no matter what. 
My beat's on the east side of town, 
Among the boa ton and elite, 
Where beauty and style promenade, 
The belles of the season I 
meet. 
CHORUS. 
As I 
march along on dress parade, 
Or saunter on my beat, 
The exclamations greet my ear— 
" 
011, Julia, ain't he sweet! 
They talk about my grace and style, 
To look at me they stop, 
This epithet they all apply— 
He's a 
nobby little cop. 
All the parties and balls I 
attend, 
The ladies invite me of course, 
An excuse the captain must get— 
Good order and rules to enforce, 
My duties I 
own I 
neglect, 
But only on occasions rare; 
And instead of wielding baton, 
I 
flirt with the ladies so fair. 
As I 
march along, lee. 
I'm a 
terror to all the youmg men, 
Who hideous make night with their noise; 
Anonymous notes I 
oft get, saying— 
" 
Please don't be hard on the boys!" 
They know it's no use to be rash, 
For there's two of us—me and my pop; 
And they know I 
mean biz when I 
draw, 
So they try to keep in with this cop.

MIKE O'GRADY'S SPREE. 
Written and sung by " Joe Banks." 
Mike O'Grady had been married 
Just a 
twelve-month and a 
day, 
When he sent some letters to the by's 
In which he went to say, 
As how about just two months since 
A 
darling had been sent, 
So he gave a " spree" to celebrate 
The glorious event. 
Chorus. 
With a 
lal de doodle I, 
And the tural looral liddle, 
They played upon the fiddle, 
While they went up and down the middle, 
Such " taring by:s and purty girls 
As ever you did see, 
A 
regular, rollicking soort of a 
dance 
Was Mike O'Grady's spree 
"Nora Creena" was there so nately dressed 
Along with "Pat Malloy", 
Larry O'Gaff, " Kitty from Cork 
And " Ted" from Ballacroy, 
Then "Rory O'Moore" came thro' the door 
And pulled up Johannah Leary 
To dance that rale old Irish tune 
That's christened " Paddy Carey." 
She danced away for an hour or two, 
Waltz, Polkas and Squadreels, 
Ye'd a' cracked your si&s, if ye'd seen them all 
A 
kicking up their heels, 
There was "Mary Jane" with her new delane 
And poor old "Nancy Barr" 
A " jigging it" up and down the flare 
With " Pat of Mullingar." 
I

After dancing, came the "aiting," 
Faith ' twas illegant to see— 
Grady helping all the girls, 
And pouring out the tay, 
He laned across the table 
For to hand "Miss Rourke" the bread, 
When a "spud" came whizzing from behind, 
And struck him on the head. 
The row, it then began, 
Sure to stop 'em was no use. 
" 
Larry the slob" got a 
slap in the gob 
With a 
bran new roasted goose; 
Grady "tried to interfere," 
"I want this stopped," he said; 
When " two of 'em knocked the fiddler down 
And laid him out for dead. 
Sure there never was, or never will 
Be seen again a 
fight, 
As the one that happened at " Grady's" 
On that memorable night. 
Ten broken heads—six in their beds 
Summed up by Doctor Dee, 
Was the list of killed and wounded 
At poor Mike O'Grady's spree.

With banners proudly floating o'er the gallant Irishmen.

Ever since I 
slipped on thy peel I 
feel so sore; 
On my back I 
linger'd just where I

banana and showing their legs. 
Many are the pedestrians you've caused to fall— 
Great, big and little, lean, lank and tall;

lean banana from some Dutch grocery store.

Glove, and Parasol Flirtations; the corre.t iLterpretation of all Signals, 
superior to the deaf and dumb alphabet, as the notice of bystanders 
is not attracted; the most delicate hints van be given without danger of 
misunderstanding—also, the Floral language of Love. The whole form-
ing a 
rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen. Read what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Mail writes • k 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. 
J. 
FISHER'S, 98 Nas-
sau street ceded the ' Little Flirt" We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat Baia 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 99 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

usages of this country. 
The questions being more numerous, and the

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards bas been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
went. As a 
result of this dilemma, manylives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence which might have been prolonged 
an d 
enjoyed 
in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
/he state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
