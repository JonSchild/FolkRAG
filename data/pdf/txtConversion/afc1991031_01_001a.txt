OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 
From August 18 to August 30, 1980, the American 
Folklife Center of the Library of Congress, with the assistance 
of the Rocky Mountain Continental Divide Foundation, conducted a 
field research project in the Blue River Valley area of Colorado 
(Summit County, Grand County). The project was considered an 
"extended consultancy" rather than a more comprehensive survey or 
in-depth study. Its main goal was to assist the Colorado 
foundation in developing an outdoor museum and educational center 
on traditional life and work in the high mountains. 
The two-week fieldwork period concentrated on 
demonstrating folkloristic methodology and the particulars of 
research on material culture, local history, and ranching 
traditions. The field team worked closely with John D. Farr, the 
prime source of enthusiasm and organization for the future 
museum. The Center offered assistance to a small organization 
lacking other resources, created the nucleus of a research 
archive for the foundation and museum, and compiled data for the 
Archive of Folk Culture. The Colorado Project also utilized the 
services of student "interns" rather than "professional" 
folklorists, an approach that was later adopted during work on 
the Blue Ridge Parkway Project and the Pinelands Folklife 
Project. 
The actual field project was preceded by two site 
visits in 1979 and follow-up work by two of the researchers as 
private consultants in the summer of 1981. The field team 
consisted of Howard W. (Rusty) Marshall, project director; Elke 
Dettmer, then of the University of California, Berkeley and now 
attending the Memorial University of Newfoundland, intern; 
Barbara Orbach, University of California, Los Angeles, intern. 
Background research in Denver was also undertaken by Ron Emrich, 
then in the historic preservation program at Columbia University. 
l 
THE PROJECT COLLECTION 
The materials in this collection emphasize local 
history and material culture, particularly with regard to ranch 
life. Among the events documented are haymaking, traditional 
German cooking, lodgepole pine building construction, and the 
making of snow skis. Brief subject, informant, and place 
descriptions can be found in the photo and sound recording 
sections of this inventory with more detailed information 
available on the photo and sound logs. 
The Colorado Project's holdings are identified by 
several sets of numbers. The first is a working number, CO80, 
which is used both as an acronym for the project and as a prefix 
to numbers assigned to project documentation during fieldwork. 
The collection was later inventoried and Archive of Folk Culture 
(formerly Archive of Folk Song) numbers were given to each sound 
recording. These numbers, AFS 22,440-22,456, are used to identify 
the project collection as a whole. Another set of numbers was 
provided by the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound 
Division of the Library and refers to the Library shelf location 
of the collection's sound recordings. These numbers include RXA 
4005-4017 for reel-to-reel recordings and RYA 2609-2612 for 
audiocassettes. 
The following list provides the total quantity of 
photographic materials and sound recordings for the collection: 
Black and White Photographic Documentation 
33 rolls of 35mm. negatives 
Color Photographic Documentation 
50 envelopes of transparencies (some with more 
than one rack) 
Sound Recording Documentation 
12 7-inch reels @ 7 1/2 ips 
1 5-inch reel @ 7 1/2 ips 
4 audiocassettes 
The fieldnotes record the fieldworkers' activities, 
impressions, and interpretations of the phenomena they observed. 
As such they provide a context for the project photographs and 
sound recordings. The collection includes approximately 170 pages 
of fieldnotes and 10 pages of interview report forms. 
About 90 pages of logs accompany the photographs and the 
sound recordings. These logs identify the subjects of the 
photographs and sound recordings. They also provide dates, names, 
and places of documentation. 
As mentioned above, a general description of the 
contents of both sound recordings and photographs is provided in 
this inventory. In addition, their is a concordance which 
indicates the various numbers assigned to each sound recording. 
The Colorado Project Collection is divided into four 
categories: 
li 
Administration: materials relevant to the planning and 
execution of the project, such as bibliographies, 
budget, invoices, correspondence, memoes, and 
press coverage; 
Collected Publications and Ephemera: materials such as 
booklets, brochures, articles, newspaper 
clippings, acquired before and during the project; 
Documentation: fieldnotes, supplemental information 
(architectural sketches, maps, lists of contacts, 
log forms, interview reports, artifact log, 
fieldwork calendar, copies of county documents), 
photographs, sound recordings, and logs created 
during fieldwork; 
Final Products: interns' and director's reports. 
in 
ACCESS TO THE COLLECTION 
The policy of the American Folklife Center concerning public 
use of its collections is outlined in the pamphlet "A Guide to 
the Collections of Recorded Folk Music and Folklore in the 
Library of Congress," available from the Archive of Folk Culture. 
Advance appointments for perusal of holdings are advisable. 
The American Folklife Center actively encourages use of its 
collections and those of the Archive of Folk Culture. However, 
the nature of the material requires careful citation whenever the 
photographs, recordings, manuscripts, or transcriptions are 
reproduced. The Archive and the Center are concerned that the 
people who have been documented benefit from the use of these 
materials. The publication of sound recordings, for example, 
requires the permission of the person on the recording or his or 
her next-of-kin. Any bibliographic entry, footnote, photo 
caption, or sound recording headnote should include the names of 
the informants and photographer or sound recordist, the date and 
place of the documentation, the Library of Congress accession 
numbers, and the title of the project. The credit line must also 
refer to the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress.

number indicates the batch number (all 165738) and the roll 
number. All of the negatives are 35mm. For Barbara Orbach's 
photos, brief descriptions of the contents of each roll (taken 
from photo logs) is provided. Her rolls are the only ones for 
which a photographer can definitely be determined. Marshall's

* Numbers CO80-ED-R3 to R5 formerly were numbered as CO80-ED/BO- 
R1 to R3. The earlier numbers were assigned because both Elke 
Dettmer and Barbara Orbach had served as recordists. I decided 
such a dual designation was confusing and assigned the numbers to 
Elke's series only. The logs have been corrected to reflect this 
change, although both fieldworkers' names continue to appear as 
recordists.
