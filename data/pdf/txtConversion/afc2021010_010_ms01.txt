Stephanie Endicott (b. 1949, Trenton, Michigan) is a recently retired rural letter carrier who worked a 
rural route for 35 years out of the Louisa, Kentucky Post Office. She serves as the Kentucky Rural Letter 
Carriers Association District Officer and has been active in the union since she first started working for 
the Postal Service, previously serving as State President.  
Endicott still owns a house in Louisa, Kentucky, and splits time between Richmond, Kentucky and 
Louisa. She met her husband when he was a customer on her route.  
I was put in touch with Stephanie Endicott by Karen Button, a rural mail carrier in Park City, Kentucky 
who I interviewed, and Karen’s sister Kathy Short, who is also a rural carrier. We met for the interview at 
Stephanie’s Richmond home and sat at her dining room table.

00:00 
SE: I just noticed my tablecloth's on upside down! (laughs) 
 
EH: Oh! I didn't notice. (laughs) 
 
SE: Oh well. 
 
EH: So the date is 11th, February 11th, 2022. I'm here with Stephanie Endicott in Richmond, Kentucky. 
Why don't you introduce yourself and tell me your name, where you're from and the year you were born? 
 
SE: My name is Stephanie Endicott. I was born in Trenton, Michigan in 1949. I carried mail for 30 years 
in Louisa, Kentucky. 
 
EH: I'm from Indiana. Where is Trenton--is that around Detroit? 
 
SE: Yes, it is. 
 
EH: And were your family, were they from Kentucky? (Stephanie nods no) You're from Michigan.  
 
SE: No, my whole family is from Michigan. I moved here when my then-husband got a job. 
 
EH: I see. I went to school in Ann Arbor. 
 
SE: Oh did you? 
 
EH: U of M. 
 
SE: I went to school in Ypsilanti. 
 
EH: Oh cool! That's a cool town. 
 
SE: Uh-huh. That's where I lived--that's where my 3 children were born. 
 
EH: Oh nice. Yeah, all my friends are moving to Ypsilanti because Ann Arbor's too expensive. (laughs) 
 
SE: (laughs)  
 
EH: So why don't you tell me about how you got involved in being a rural mail carrier? 
 
SE: I was working at the Water Office at the time and one of my coworkers had family that worked for 
the Post Office, and he was taking the test and he said, "Why don't you come and take it?" So, I went and 
took it (laughs) and then we both got interviews for the same office. Neither of us got it and then I did get 
offered a job. 
 
EH: Nice. And was that in Louisa?

SE: You're making me think here. (phone rings) That's my husband--can I... 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
 
SE: Hello (answers phone) 
 
EH: (pauses and restarts recorder after phone call) Oh that's okay!  
 
SE: I should be good. 
 
EH: Yeah, no problem (laughs). So you got the job. And was that in Louisa? 
 
SE: Yes. I was living in Huddy at the time. And I drove to Louisa every day. 
 
EH: How far is that? 
 
SE: Too far (laughs). It took almost an hour. And then I eventually moved. 
 
EH: Moved to Louisa? 
 
SE: Yes. 
 
EH: Tell me about what appealed to you about the job? 
 
SE: First off the pay, the retirement. And once I started, I really liked that I was on my own out there in 
my car, nobody looking over my shoulder. I had wonderful relationships with the customers. I just, I 
really liked it.  
 
EH: Tell me about your customers and how you developed relationships with them? 
 
SE: Well, a lot of times the first time you met a customer was when they had a complaint. In fact, that's 
how I met my husband. 
 
EH: Really? 
 
SE: Yes. His last name is Endicott. There were a lot of Endicotts on the route and not everybody used 
correct addresses. Sometimes you had to guess where the mail went and some customers got quite upset 
when you didn't guess correctly. So. That's how I met a lot of the customers. (laughs) 
 
EH: So he was upset with you? 
 
SE: Yes. 
 
EH: And how did that turn into a love story? 
 
SE: Well, he just kind of asked around and found out that I wasn't married, so. I'm sure this is really 
interesting for your study! (laughs) 
 
EH: No, it's great! (laughs) And then he somehow wasn't so upset anymore?

SE: Correct. 
 
EH: (laughs) That's quite a story! (laughs) So, yeah, tell me about some of that, well it sounds like that 
was a relationship that started out negative but turned positive so tell me about some of the other positive 
relationships that you formed over time. 
 
SE: Well, just a lot of the customers. You know, there was one elderly lady who didn't pick up her mail 
for a couple days, so I went to her house to check on her. You know, just little things like that. I had one 
lady who had fallen in her yard and when I drove by (little girl knocks on back door). 
 
EH: There's a little girl. 
 
SE: Sorry. 
 
EH: That's okay. So a lady who fell in her yard.  
 
SE: And she was just sitting there waving me down. Bless her heart, she had broken her hip and couldn't 
get up. She didn't have her phone with her so she trusted me to go in the house and call someone and I 
stayed with her. And then her daughter gave me a big basket of flower. Which is, so many times the 
customers on the route don't have contact with anybody, especially the elderly who don't drive. So you 
just, you know who those people are and you have to look out for them. 
 
EH: Was the woman who hadn't picked up her mail in several days--was she okay? 
 
SE: She was very confused, so I called Social Services and her relatives put her in a nursing home. 
Unfortunate, but you know, sometimes mail carriers are the only ones that have daily contact with people 
and you know when there's a problem. 
 
EH: Tell me about ways that customers showed their appreciation. Did they ever leave or give you gifts 
or anything like that?  
 
SE: A lot of the customers would leave homemade goodies. I had one lady who would make me, what did 
she call it, you know out of Chex Mix, and Payday bars, or a cupcake. One elderly lady, bless her heart, 
would give me an apple wrapped in a paper towel. (laughs) Because she washed it for me! So, you kinda 
watched out for those people. 
 
EH: Right, right. Tell me how you learned the job and you know, if anyone trained you and how easy or 
difficult it was to learn? 
 
SE: Back when I first started, there was no training, basically. I went to Ashland and sat in a room and 
watched some videos. It was on the job training, which is only as good as the person training you. But 
now they have what is called the Academy, the Training Academy. And I was an academy instructor for I 
don't know, maybe 10 years. And it was 3 days, it's 4 days now, in the classroom, going over everything. 
Like classes of mail and what you do with each class, and how you take care of customers that have 
forwarded. It was in my opinion, very informative. A lot of people feel it's a waste of time, that you can 
only learn how to do your job on the job, but again, it's only as good as the person training you. If they 
tell you this mail goes here and this mail goes here to forward and this you can throw away, you need to 
know why you're doing that. 
 
EH: Right. And how long did you carry the mail for?

Interview with Stephanie Endicott – 2/11/2022

SE: Thirty years. 
 
EH: Was that all in the same community, on the same route? 
 
SE: Yes. I subbed on a route for 4 months and then, it doesn't happen like that anymore. But then I 
became a regular carrier. So, I was very fortunate. I stayed on the same route, so I knew customers. And 
they knew me, they knew where I lived, my phone number was in the book. Some carriers would not do 
that and I felt, this is my community. I live here, I see these people in the grocery store, I see them in 
church, they need to be able to reach me. So. 
 
EH: How long was your route and how many boxes? 
 
SE: You're asking me something I don't even remember! (laughs)  
 
EH: Oh wow. 
 
SE: It was maybe 80 miles. It went in 2 counties which a lot of people didn't understand, but it kept the 
same zip code in both counties. Some routes have different zip codes. Okay, when I first started, I worked 
6 days a week and then the route grew so that I only worked 5 days a week. 
 
EH: Because it took you longer during the days? 
 
SE: Yes. Rural routes are evaluated. It's hard for other people to understand that. 
 
EH: Yeah, I learned about that at the meeting (KY Rural Letter Carriers Association 2022 winter 
meeting) actually because they're going through a re-evaluation process, so it was really helpful to learn. 
 
SE: Correct. As you gain more customers and more miles, your evaluation goes up meaning you have 
more time allotted to finish the route. So by the reverse token, if you lose miles and lose customers, it can 
go down. So when it gets so big, then you don't work as many days, if that makes sense. 
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
SE: Okay.  
 
EH: How did you, well first could you describe what the route was like as far as the terrain and the 
landscape for someone who has never been, you know maybe someone who's never been to Kentucky, 
eastern Kentucky before. 
 
SE: Okay. Part of the route is paved roads. Most of the route is gravel, dirt, sometimes they just look like 
one-lane roads. There were hills. There's good roads, bad roads. It is rural. Some rural routes in the state 
are almost like a city route--on nice, paved roads, but mine was rural. You get out some of those little 
hollers and you don't even know where it's gonna end or what you're gonna run into. So, I know my 
parents in Michigan could not comprehend what my rural route was like. They had never been in the hills 
and the backroads of Kentucky. 
 
EH: Yeah, it's definitely a different experience! (laughs) Being from a very flat place. Now I actually, 
when I go home, I am sort of taken aback by how flat it is because I've gotten used to the hills and 
mountains, but...

SE: Even parts of Kentucky are flatter than others. Some routes are more like city routes. And some are 
more rural than mine.  
 
12:45  
 
EH: Were there things that you know, particularly with carrying the mail and being in a community, that 
you had to get used to or that were different from what you experienced growing up in Michigan. 
 
SE: Yes. Some people didn't have running water, you know. When I needed to use the bathroom out on 
the route, there were outhouses or you hit the bushes. Some people had clotheslines out year round. Some 
people had what I consider junk and trash in their yards. I was not used to that. Usually just traveling 
main roads, you don't see that. But on the back roads in the rural areas, you see that.  
 
EH: How did the route change, if it changed over the 30 years? Did the landscape change and sort of 
development or farms coming in or leaving or other ways places change? 
 
SE: They did put a little, what did they call it, I called it a little sub-division on my route. You know, they 
paved some roads and put houses on a little farming community. Other than that, new houses went up, old 
houses were torn down, trailers were moved in. So it changed like that. There aren't a lot of I guess zoning 
restrictions in some of the areas, so you could move 2 or 3 trailers in whereas in a city you can't always do 
that.  
 
EH: What about weather? Did the weather change over time and what was your experience with weather 
and how you handled it? 
 
SE: I did not like ice. Snow was okay, but just a little bit of snow or ice when you're stopping close to 500 
times a day and starting again, it's a little bit different mindset when you're driving. You learn quickly 
about fishtailing and you don't give it a lot of gas and studded tires and chains and things like that are 
things that not all the customers understand. They would clean out by their box, just enough for them to 
walk, which is fine for them to get their mail, but you can't drive to it. And when snowplows, when they 
actually came on some of the roads, would pile the snow up by the box. So you were really leaning out 
the window to try to reach their box. And they didn't understand if they didn't get mail for a day or two. 
So it's a little bit, you have to educate the people too. Not that they're dumb or stupid, they're just unaware 
of or they don't think about you sitting in a car with a snowbank between you.  
 
EH: (laughs) Right. So let's talk about your vehicle. What sort of vehicle did you have and was it right-
side drive? 
 
SE: Okay. I started out in a Citation with bench seats which was fine because most carriers sit in the 
middle. Okay? And it's difficult with bucket seats. I delivered in a truck for a while and a vehicle with 
bucket seats. You kind of put a pillow in between or build a platform. It's difficult sitting in the middle of 
the car because the rear view mirror is right there and you're judging distances a little. It's a little difficult 
to get in and out when you have to deliver packages. Okay? So eventually I said this is too hard on my 
body, I'm going to get a right-hand drive vehicle. So I had two or three right hand drive vehicles and I had 
one vehicle that I converted to a right hand drive because our time frame there, there weren't any right-
hand drive available. So my last vehicle was a Subaru I had converted--all-wheel drive.  
 
EH: And what were the other, the previous right-hand drive cars?

Interview with Stephanie Endicott – 2/11/2022

SE: Subarus. Factory-installed Subarus. And I had a Jeep Liberty that was dual control. 
 
EH: Mmhm. So does that mean you could drive from either side? 
 
SE: Yes. 
 
EH: Oh! I've never seen that. 
 
SE: Yes. And when I retired, I sold it to one of the other carriers. It was very nice. 
 
EH: I bet that's coveted. 
 
SE: Mmhm, mmhm. 
 
EH: So how did the conversion work--did you do that yourself? 
 
18:19  
 
SE: No, I went to a place in Tennessee that did them and this conversion just had one steering wheel and 
then it had belts with a pulley. 
 
EH: I see. 
 
SE: The factory-installed, the factory Subarus just had one steering wheel on the right. The Jeep Liberty 
was a dual control and then my last Subaru was a installed right-hand drive. 
 
EH: So in that the steering wheel is on the left and you have pulleys, or the steering wheel is on the right? 
 
SE: The steering wheel was on the right and pulleys going where the steering wheel used to be. Yes, yes. 
 
EH: Interesting. And how did that handle? Was it more difficult than the factory-installed? 
 
SE: No. The only--it was a little awkward. Well the factory-installed too, when you go through the drive-
through at the bank or (laughs), you know, and the turn signals. You had to have a bar, you know. Just a 
few little. But any vehicle you drive has its own little quirks. But the right-hand drives are the conversions 
are so much easier on your body. 
 
EH: Yeah, tell me about some of the effects of doing that repetitive motion every day? 
 
SE: A lot of carriers develop carpal tunnel. One in my office had both wrists operated on. I wore a brace 
for a while which helped and I never needed the surgery. Another issue a lot of carriers have is the rotator 
cuff, okay, because of all the repetitive issue. A lot of carriers have back problems. Not just from the 
uncomfortable position driving, but from lifting the packages which can weigh up to 70 pounds, and the 
twisting in your vehicle to get things from the back. So it's hard on your body. 
 
EH: Yeah. How did the job change over time? 
 
20:53

Interview with Stephanie Endicott – 2/11/2022

SE: It became more mechanized, if that's the correct word. When I first started, all the mail came in trays 
or tubs in no particular order, and you had to put it in delivery order. After a while, the machines were 
putting the letters in order for you, which supposedly made it easier. It was not 100%, but it was pretty 
good. And not everything was run through a machine, so you still had some what they call raw letters. 
And flats, you know, large envelopes, magazines, you had to work by hand. But now they have what they 
call a flat sorting machine that sorts the flats. I've not personally worked with those. And another change 
was the barcodes on items needed to be scanned whereas when I first started, they didn't. And I think 
there's even more scanning now than when I retired. 
 
EH: Does that make things easier or harder or a little bit of both? 
 
SE: A little bit of both. A lot of people do not like change. A lot of people would fight any new change 
and they'd mumble and grumble (laughs). But honestly it just made it so you could handle more in a day.  
 
EH: Tell me about some unusual days on the job or unusual occurrences, you know whether it's 
interaction with a customer or weather or yeah, something you're delivering? 
 
SE: Well, some of the strange things we delivered: cremated remains, crickets, live chicks--those were not 
fun. 
 
EH: They made a lot of noise? 
 
SE: Yes. And if you had the rooster, they would be so quiet and then all of a sudden, they'd [crow] and it 
would startle you and if you had the biddies, they'd just constant--and feathers! 
 
EH: Oh wow.  
 
SE: Of course your vehicle is gonna break down sometimes. And that's scary. If you don't know how to 
repair it yourself like I didn't, so I carried a toolbox. I carried tow chains, jumper cables. Because usually 
someone would stop, especially, this is an advantage of the females, especially for females, in my 
opinion, they would stop. And sometimes they could help you but they never had tools. We fixed my car 
once with a paperclip. My dad was so impressed! (laughs) 
 
EH: How did you do that?  
 
SE: I don't know what he did with it. I knew where he put it. Okay, flat tires--I can change a flat tire as 
long as I can loosen the lug nuts. That's kind of hard. When you get tires put on, you have to ask them not 
to use the, is it an air wrench, or to back it up a little bit, because otherwise even bouncing on the tire iron 
you can't do it. Okay, it's just that's another reason you need to get along with your customers, because 
you're gonna need help out there and they will help you. One of the ladies on my route when I first 
started, because I was a single mother, okay, she said, "Honey, be real friendly with all the women. Then 
they won't mind if their husbands help you." 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
SE: Which, you know... 
 
EH: Yeah, right!

SE: If a man came out a lot of times the woman would be right there, which is fine, and I'd talk more to 
her, because I appreciate the help, but I was not out there flirting. 
 
EH: Right. Good advice (laughs) 
 
SE: Mmhm. It is. But there are wonderful customers.  
 
EH: Yeah, tell me about who they were generally and what kind of things they did, what the population or 
demographic was like. 
 
SE: Most of the customers that we would see would be the elderly because they weren't at work. Or we'd 
see the mothers that were home with young children because then most of the people that were of 
working age, I'd say most, unfortunately I had a lot of people on welfare on my route that were at home 
all the time, you know, but you just kinda know who's home and who's not and you know who has a drug 
problem and who is drinking and one thing I always wanted to know was who had a phone because 
cellphones did not work in a lot of places on my route and kinda tried to remember who did I deliver a 
phone bill to? 
 
EH: Oh yeah. 
 
SE: Okay, because if you break down and it's 2 miles this way and it's a mile that way, you want to know 
what's your best shot of finding somebody home and help.  
 
EH: Did you ever have, you know, real concerns for your safety on the route? 
 
27:05  
 
SE: Yes, I did. There was one dead end and there were usually a bunch of cars there, a bunch of guys 
standing around, and yes, it did bother me, especially when I first started because they'd all just kind of 
stare. So one day I said, this is silly. I'm gonna wave at 'em. And ever since then, I waved and they waved. 
It was fine. I was new, they didn't know me, I didn't know them. I had one other experience. I had a naked 
man out on the route and that's very frightening. 
 
EH: Yeah! 
 
SE: Okay, I reported it to my postmaster and some of the other carriers knew about it. Well, it happened 
more than one place on the route, but I didn't know who it was. 
 
EH: It was the same person? 
 
SE: Yes. I didn't know who it was. So they finally persuaded me to file charges and I did go to court. So, 
because there's no reason that you should be afraid.  
 
EH: Right. 
 
SE: A carrier friend of mine had a person that would sit on the porch with a shotgun on his lap that would 
kind of bother them. Well, the postmaster or the inspection service, somebody went out and talked to 
them. Because there's no reason we should be afraid to do our job. That's the job of the postmaster to take 
care of issues like that. One more.

EH: Yeah! (laughs) 
 
28:57  
 
SE: I had a man who was known to drink quite a bit (laughs). He would come up to the car and he'd kind 
of lean in the window, "Hey Sissy, you got my check today?" (laughs) He didn't know what day he got his 
check. And it bothered me a little bit. The postmaster went out and talked to him. 
 
EH: Well it's good you had a supportive postmaster. 
 
SE: Yes, I did.  
 
EH: What about animals? Dogs, but then also wildlife--were those issues? 
 
SE: There were a lot of turkeys and deer and pigs out on the route. Somebody had some emus. 
 
EH: Wow! 
 
SE: Yeah. We are told we're not required to get out if there's a dog or animal. Some of those--chickens 
too would attack! 
 
EH: Yeah, they can be scary! (laughs) 
 
SE: Yeah! (laughs) So I never had a run-in with an animal. If there was a dog out, I would not get out. I 
would blow the horn. If they didn't come, they'd get a notice. A carrier in my office did get dog bit. A dog 
was on one of those guide wire or whatever you call it and the owner was standing right there. And 
neither one of them thought the dog could reach her, but it did. So no, I didn't have any close encounters 
with animals.  
 
EH: That's good. 
 
SE: And I love animals. I've always had dogs. And so many customers will say, "My dog won't bite." 
They're wrong. Any dog will bite. 
 
EH: I've heard that as well. Karen was talking about that. 
 
SE: Any dog will bite. 
 
31:00  
 
EH: What are the stories that rural mail carriers, when you get together, you tell about your work? 
 
SE: (laughs) Mostly they complain about their postmasters!  
 
EH: (laughs)  
 
SE: I'm sorry, but I can't complain. I had 3 or 4 different postmasters and the only problem I ever had with 
them. One of them was what I would call wishy-washy. One day you were supposed to do something one 
way, and the next day he'd change his mind. But mine were consistent, we knew what was expected of us, 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard

for the most part they backed us up with the customers. But a lot of carriers do not have offices like that. 
So I've been very fortunate that way. 
 
EH: If you remember, how many routes were out of the post office that you worked out of. 
 
SE: When I started there were 5, when I retired there were 7 rural routes. 2 highway contractor and 1 city. 
Because the area had grown that much. 
 
EH: Let's see. What else did you bring with you in the car. You talked about tools in case your car broke 
down. Did you bring clothes for weather, snacks, that sort of thing? 
 
SE: Yes. You always had to have a change of clothes. You had to have toilet paper (laughs) in case you 
had to hit the hills or the outhouses. Always the change of clothes because if you get wet and cold, you 
are miserable all day long. Things like Fix-a-flat. I mentioned the toe strap. Pens--people would steal your 
pens. Paper. Rubber bands, just things like that. And food, because there's no McDonalds out there. 
 
EH: Yeah, right. Did you bring your lunch with you? 
 
SE: When I first started, yes, and then I bought a house that was midway on my route so I could go in the 
house and use the bathroom and make a grilled cheese sandwich and be on my way!  
 
EH: Nice. What do you wish the general public knew about the job of rural mail carrying? 
 
SE: We cannot be at your house the same time every day. It depends on the amount of mail that we have. 
If we have it, we will bring it to you. Why would we leave it at the office? (laughs) And it is not lost in 
our car under the seats (laughs). And we really do like our jobs. 
 
EH: (laughs) What was your favorite part of the job? 
 
SE: Probably talking to customers. But I hate to say this, but now the way the Postal Service is, you are 
discouraged from doing that. Because the scanners know how long you stop at different places and if you 
stop at one place, sometimes your postmaster will know it and they'll question you. And I never did like 
that because we are still the Postal SERVICE. And if granny, who never sees anybody, wants to talk to 
you for 10 minutes, I think we should talk to her. And it's not the carrier's fault that they can't. 
 
EH: Yeah, that's been a theme in what a lot of people have talked about. You know, is it a business--it just 
seems that there's a tension always in the Post Office, whether it's a business or a service and then I've 
come to think of rural carriers as performing a sort of care work that you know, maybe they don't get paid 
for but is actually really important to talk to people and form these relationships.  
 
35:24  
 
SE: It is a lot of people can't get into town when the post office is open. We have been called the post 
office on wheels because we sell stamps, money orders, we'll take packages and weigh them and send 
them on for people. We will do ANY of those things. And some people that are used to city delivery or 
highway contract delivery don't know that we provide those services. 
 
EH: So highways contractors don't offer money orders and stamps and that sort of thing? 
 
SE: I don't know if they're required to or not. City carriers are not required to.

EH: Interesting. Did you listen to the radio or books on tape or anything on your route? 
 
SE: It's kinda hard to listen to books on tape or talk radio because you're getting in and out all the time, 
but I did try, yes. I like that old-time radio. 
 
EH: Oh yeah, uh-huh. 
 
SE: Or just NPR just to kinda know what's going on.  
 
EH: Let's take a look, see what else we haven't talked about yet here. Oh yeah, we haven't talked about 
the union. Tell me about your involvement in the union (National Rural Letter Carriers Association) and 
some of the relationships and friendships you have with other union members. 
 
SE: I have been a union member for 35 years. I have been district officer for 25 years. I was secretary-
treasurer. I have been on the state board, all the way up to being state president. 
 
EH: Oh you were state president! Nice! 
 
SE: Yes, ma'am. Kathy [Short] was on the board. 
 
EH: Oh cool.  
 
SE: She's been state president. I've been an academy trainer. The union is my second family. I have made 
so many good friends and so many that have passed on, you know. When I first started going to union 
meetings, the room would be full. The room would be full. Lately, I don't know how many were there in 
Somerset. 
 
EH: 18 maybe? 
 
SE: Mmhm. And 8 of them are on the board, have to be there. And some of them are appointed officers 
like me who should have been there. I would say at least half of them that were there are retired carriers 
who still have the interest in what's going on and they want to stay connected with the people. And it's sad 
because the younger people need to be involved. To me, the union is where you get your information 
about your job. I finally got one guy in my office to start going. He's now our local steward. He's also the 
district secretary--I handed it off to him. He does go to the meetings, but no one else in my office will go. 
A lot of people have in their head that the union is a bunch of people out there picketing and protesting. 
They don't understand that the union is what is protecting their job, is what is trying to get better working 
conditions and better wages. I'm sorry I get on my soapbox about the union! 
 
EH: No, no go ahead! 
 
SE: I am VERY pro-union. I hate it when I miss a meeting but sometimes, you know.  
 
EH: Yeah. Why do you think interest in the union has declined? 
 
39:35  
 
SE: (Sighs) People are of the mentality that the union doesn't do anything for them. "Why should I go and 
spend my time?" They try to move them [meetings] around the state and have them centrally located so

not everybody has to stay all night. We used to do all the business on Sundays when nobody worked. 
That's not true anymore. A lot of the subs are working Sundays with Amazon deliveries. So it's just lack 
of interest. People now are considering it a job more than a career. So many of them don't know what 
they're entitled to. I'm on several websites and some of the questions that people ask are just basic things 
about your job. It's like why don't you know this? It's your job, it's your money! It just amazes me that 
they have no interest in talking to other people and finding out what they don't know. 
 
EH: Do you think that some of the perception of the union as protestors and picketers is because of the 
history of that here in this region? 
 
SE: Possibly. Possibly. One of the carriers in my office's husband was involved in the union where he 
worked and it was more contentious than ours is. Ours is more informational.  
 
EH: And did you grow up with awareness of the union or in a union family or anything? 
 
SE: Yeah, my dad was in a union and my brother was. What was he? He was a union steward. 
 
41:46  
 
EH: Let's see--I had another question about the union. Maybe kind of more generally, what do you think 
the future of the craft is? 
 
SE: If people don't start taking more of an interest--there will always be rural carriers. But I don't know 
who's going to look out for them, you know? Carriers in my office would complain about things. "Well it 
should be this way." Submit a resolution! Go to a meeting! Let people know how you feel about things! "I 
don't have time to do that." Things are not gonna change if you don't make the effort. 
 
EH: Do you think some of that might be, do people feel like they're working longer hours, because they're 
so tracked? Yeah, I just wonder if there's some kind of connection there where people feel like they don't 
have time or yeah. 
 
SE: Possibly. And part of the issue, it hasn't been in Louisa because we've always been able to hire 
people, but we have never--I won't say never--maybe for very short periods of time, had as many people 
working there as we could have. A lot of offices, you'll hear this, there might be 10 rural routes, 2 or 3 
subs. So the subs are not happy. They're having to work more than they want. The regular carriers are not 
happy because they can't get off when they want. And who do they blame? They blame the union. But 
right now, starting pay for an RCA is I think $19.06. Well starting pay at the factory in Grayson is $17. 
Starting pay at some fast food place is $15. So why would someone want to work as hard as you work for 
that much, you know, plus supply your own vehicle. Plus RCAs unless they buy their own insurance, they 
get no benefits, no paid days off, their time doesn't even count toward retirement. It's very discouraging to 
try and get new people. And the union, it's their fault!   
 
EH: (laughs) And a CA, what does that stand for? 
 
SE: RCA? 
 
EH: RCA, okay. 
 
SE: Rural Carrier Associate. They're the subs.

EH: Got it. What do you think the importance of rural carriers are to the communities they serve? 
 
SE: They are the only person that a lot of the customers see. They can report the condition of the roads. 
Basically they go where no one else wants to go, you know? My son works for UPS, okay? He lives right 
over there (laughs). He works for UPS and we have the same discussions. But, I don't know what the 
future of the Postal Service. Sometimes I think it's very sad. But they just did pass something in Congress 
Tuesday that the Postal Service doesn't have to pre-fund their retirement anymore, which is a big thing.  
 
EH: I saw that. 
 
SE: It's a big thing. 
 
EH: Yeah. And so did that--I knew it passed the house--did it pass the senate as well? 
 
SE: Not that I know of. 
 
EH: Okay.  
 
SE: But that's a big start right there. Another thing, you probably heard a lot about this new proposed 
contract? That has not been ratified yet, but it will give the RCAs, the sub carriers, some vacation and sick 
days. 
 
EH: That's good. 
 
SE: So, yes. Yes, it will give them something if it's passed. Which, they deserve something!  
 
EH: Yeah. Yeah! And what do you think about the new--you know, there was a lot of questions about the 
new evaluation and how people will be paid and you know, some carriers are concerned that it's going to 
go down. Do you have thoughts about that? 
 
SE: I haven't read the 99 pages. I have read a little bit of it. This has been something that was decided in 
arbitration and the union is getting blamed for it. The union did not opt to do this. It was mandated for 
arbitration. I don't like the premise that someone's pay can change periodically throughout the year. I 
think it will hurt a lot of people. I don't know if it'll go up or down. But you know yourself if you're 
applying for a loan, you need a steady income. And a lot of people are upset about this. 
 
EH: Yeah, that makes sense. 
 
SE: So I don't know how it'll all work out. There are so many unanswered questions, but people can't do 
anything about it now. It's, it's here. 
 
EH: Yeah. Yeah, I mean I didn't think about that because so much is dependent, like even my student loan 
payments are dependent upon how my salary, if it goes up or down, I pay more or pay less. 
 
SE: Mmhm. If you want a car loan or a home loan, you have to show your income, you have to do your 
tax returns. And that is scary to families. I think it'll have a lot of people looking for employment 
elsewhere. 
 
EH: That's too bad.

SE: It is! It really is. It may work the other way. It may go up. It's one of those things you can't predict. 
 
EH: And then the future of the mailbox, or, the mailbox! The Postal Service--I saw mailbox written out of 
the corner of my eye--of the Postal Service, do you think there will be more pressure to privatize or are 
there other concerns? 
 
SE: It's been 35 years since I started at the Post Office; they were talking about privatizing it then. And 
they're still talking about it. I don't know that it will ever happen. I think part of it depends on who is the 
postmaster general and who's the president at the time. Some of them push it more than others. I'd hate to 
predict what would happen, but. 
 
EH: Well, is there anything else that you'd like to share that we haven't talked about? 
 
49:15  
 
SE: I wish that more managers would (hesitates), I don't know how to put this. Be familiar with the job 
that the rural carriers do and appreciate them. They are from what I read, some of them are so hard-nosed, 
you know? If a carrier is working 5-6 days a week, they need a day for doctor's appointments. They need 
a day to get their vehicles repaired. And some of them are coming down really hard on carriers that want 
those things! And they're requiring documentation for 1 day off. Some of them just need a mental health 
day! You know? I know postmasters have pressure from above on them, but I really, really wish that they 
would ease up a little bit on some of the carriers because that's how we're using a lot of them. 
Management pressure. 
 
EH: Mmhm. Yeah, that's really important. I don't know what can be done for that. When Louisa's current 
postmaster came, she had no experience with rural carriers, okay? She had been a city carrier, she had 
been a secretary. But she came in with the right attitude. She wanted to learn. She would ask us. We 
would show her something in writing. We didn't lie to her, we didn't try to pull things over on her. And 
we have an excellent working relationship. But a lot of postmasters come in possibly from the clerks or 
city carriers and think rural is the same, and it's not. And they don't take the time to try to understand it. 
That would be my greatest desire to make it easier on carriers so they don't all quit! 
 
EH: Right, right. 
 
SE: Because it is a wonderful job. 
 
EH: And tell me a little, to end on a positive note, tell me a little you know, you talked about your favorite 
part of the job, but what in your opinion makes it a wonderful job?  
 
51:43  
 
SE: The people you work with. The people you work with. They are your family. You spend more time 
with them than you do sometimes with your biological or physical family. You get there in the mornings 
when it's dark out, sometimes you stay there 'til 6, 7 at night and they're in there. You're all doing the 
same job. You know what they're going through, they know what you're going through. You go home and 
your spouse, your kids, just see you're tired. They don't understand. So yeah, it's wonderful you have, and 
I feel sorry for carriers in a 1 or 2 route office who don't have the people that they can share their rough 
day with. 
 
EH: Mmhm. Well thank you so much, this was great!
