THE BICYCLE CRANK. 
Words and Music by IKE BnowNE. 
The music of this song is published by FAIRBANKS fv, COLE, 121 Court Et, 
Boston, Mass. 
DoN'T talk of rapid transit, telephones, electric lights, 
Air navigating, roller skating, lingilistic tights; 
He's the darling of the ladies and the envy of the beaux, 
And lie calls himself •' professor 
and a 
terror to his foes. 
The Bicycle he rides, only once get on his style, 
his act will " knock you silly " with the agony he'll pile. 
lie's it gay deceiver, Latin heaver from the Harvard rank, 
And he's known to everybody as the great Bicycle Crank. 
CHOU'S. 
" What a 
darling, oh my!" the ladies they sigh. 
As lie rolls round the track on his wheel mounted high. 
" What wouldn't I 
.-1\ e, he's too sweet to live," 
This dandy, the Bicycle Crank. 
He dreams of bicycles at night, would eat one if he could--
Will talk of nothing else, ' tis said, nor could he if he would. 
The girl who once did love hint dear will never be his bride; 
lie shook her in disgust, because she couldn't learn to ride. 
Ile grew so awful thin his clothes from oil' him dropped, 
And tho' pursued by every means, he never could be stoppod. 
Such a dandy, and so handy, with his legs so lean and lank, 
lie's the champion of the universe, this great Bicycle Crank. 
" 
What a 
darling," etc. 
No matter whether on his toes. or balanced on his ear, 
You'll never find hint " off his base," nor ever " out of gear;" 
And tho' he never " tumbles," you'll always had liiimt " 
And ever ready to " catch on " and " take the cake " or die. 
Tho' his mark he may not make in Congress later on, 
A record surely he will leave of many trophies won; 
And hy the hour, in " whiskey sour," his health will oft be 
drank, 
As the champion of champions, the great Bicycle Crank. 
" What a darling," etc.

THE OLD FASHIONED COTTAGE. 
Words and Music by JAMES A.

THE old-fashioned cottage, the place I 
loved so well, 
The spot where my mother and my father used to dwell, 
Oh ! how often I 
have strolled thro' the fields of growing 
corn, 
Near the old-fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born. 
I 
remember the garden, the grove and the mill, 
And the little frame school house that stood on the hill, 
But with all its surroundings I 
loved none so well 
As the old-fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
CHORFS. 
The old fashioned cottage, the place I 
was born, 
My home once so happy, has grown so forlorn, 
How I 
long to return to the home I 
love so well, 
The old-fashioned cottage where I 
once used to dwell. 
I 
long to return to the cottage once again, 
To think of it tills my heart with sorrow and with pain, 
Many years now have passed since I 
left my dear old 
home, 
To wander abroad through this wide world to roam. 
The spot has grown lonely that once was so bright, 
Where oft mother kissed her dear children good-night ; 
Oh ! how merry the birds sang their sweet songs of yore, 
As they perch'd on the maple near the old cottage door. 
The old-fashioned cottage, etc.

WHY DID THE AN GELS TAKE MAMMA 
AWAY. 
Words and music by Jonx T. RUTLEDGE. 
The music of this song can be obt-a-med of ROE STEPHENS, Detroit, 
Mich. 
Price 40 cents. 
Copyright, 1880, by W. F. Sit 
Wnr did the angels take mamma away, 
Leaving me here in my sorrow to pine, 
Clouding my life that was once bright as May. 
Taking the love of my mother divine ? 
Weary I 
wander in search of a 
friend, 
Seeking a 
shelter to cover my head ; 
No one to help me my life to defend, 
Sometimes I 
almost could wish I 
were dead. 
C11()111:S. 
Why did the angels take mamma, away, 
Leaving me here in my sorrow to pine, 
Clouding my life that was once bright as May, 
_ Leaving me here, only sorrow is mine. 
Why did the angels take mamma, away ? 
Were there not angels enough in the sky ? 
Why did they leave me alone here to stay. 
Helpless and needy and ready to die ? 
Why don't the angels come take me there too ? 
Mother would open the beautiful gates, 
'Twas she that loy'd me so fondly and true, 
Now gone to heaven where happiness waits. 
Why did the angels, etc. 
Why did the angels take mamma away, 
Leaving her child here so helpless below ? 
Could they not spare her awhile here to stay ? 
Then naught but joy my poor heart would know. 
Will not the angels give place there for me ? 
Can I 
not go home with dear mother, too ? 
I 
am so weary and long to be free ; 
Angels come take me to mother so true. 
Why did the angels, etc.

MARY ANN I'LL TELL YOUR MA . 
I 
spoon a 
girl named Mary Ann, a 
tender little dove, 
Who 
costs me lots of hal f- pence and a 
precious deal of love; 
She's living with her mother, as a 
maiden ought to do, 
And looks as straight- and proper as a 
saint, or me, or you. 
But somehow, when I 
trot her round, no matter where we go, 
I'm struck with all the people that this maiden seems to 
know; 
For, certain as Mary Ann I 
proudly take about, [shout— 
Some heads pop round the corner, and a 
vulgar voice will 
cnont 
S. 
Oh ! very well, Mary Ann, I'll tell your ma; 
She little thought when you came out, you'd go so far. 
I'm sure your mother doesn't know the girl you are— 
Mary Ann, fie! for shame, Yahl yalil yah! Oh! yah! 
We went last Whitsun-Monday to the forest by the 
We did the thing first-class, of course— at that I 
never fail. 
I 
tipp'd the guard a 
shilling, or what you might call a 
bob, 
To lock us in a 
carriage and preserve us from the mob, 
We sat on downy cushions and the curtains drew for fun, 
For Polly said her pretty eyes they could not b( ar the sun; 
But when we settled snugly and were just about to go, 
A head came through the window and a 
fellow shouted—. 
Ohl very well, etc. 
We 
wander'd through the forest-glades as happy as could be, 
We thought, from vulgar people there, we should at least 
be free. [could hear, 
We sought a 
sweet secluded spot, where none our vows 
And whispered those soft, silly things, that lovers think so 
dear. 
We sat beneath a 
spreading oak, our loving arms entwined, 
While I 
was fond and foolish, she was gentle, sweet, and 
kind; 
But just as I 
my passion told, and sealed it with a 
kiss, 
A chap, bird's-nesting up above, so rudely sho.uted this— 
Oh! very well, etc. 
We came away disgusted, and we quickly made for home, 
For everywhere we met the cry, no matter where we'd rani. 
My Mary Ann declared to me she knew those people not— 
In fact, she said, she would not mix with such a 
vulgar lot. 
But on this precious mystery I 
have some little doubt, 
And almost think that Mary Ann must know her way about; 
For when we parted at her door, or rather just inside, 
A 
voice came down the staircase, and her little brother cried, 
SPOKEN.—Oh! 
! 
oh 
Ohl very well, etc.

  KASSIDAY. 
'rasa COMIC SONG. 
Words and Music by DONLY. 
Pnblished and copyrighted, 1879, by E. H. IIARDING, 
9 Bowery, New 
York, and sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Now list ye to my classic lay, 
Politely hearken loudly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
A blazing star of solid style ; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Coholiohos to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find. 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understand, wid a 
very fine eye fora nice 
young girl, 
And a 
pritno judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose; 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
On, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
'Meanders he, enveloped in 
A brand new fresh spring suit of gaul 
Upon his arm bangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Johannes in his mind is be, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, etc.. 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
lie sang the " mast " in " Pinafore." 
From Asian to Kalamazu, 
From Canadaw to San Franciseu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
Man, OM 
ON THE PARADE. 
SUNG WITH THE GREATEST SUCCESS BY VANCE.

Price ten canto 
Written and composed by G. W. HINT. 
They tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
And sometimes I 
think they are right, 
But so awfully naughty the masculines are, 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright. 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceiye, 
So when they their compliments pay, 
In language absurd, I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But first as a 
caution I 
say: 
CHORUS. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean whai you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away, 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say; 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are. 
When I 
go to a 
bail, and one asks me to dance, 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if lie has the chance, 
Is sure to have something to say; 
So I 
stop the sad man as soon as I 
can, 
In case he'd ho going too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me he has told two or three, 
For such sad Don Giovanis they arc. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas time whene'er it comes 'round, 
'Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe; 
Oh! would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
young man at my feet, 
With an offer of marriage, a 
mansion and carriage, 
Of course I 
soon beat a 
retreat. 
Go away, etc.

Music. 
Play Symphony of song. 
Enter JOE. 
He is dressed very shabbily—almost in rags, lie comes 
fn, stretching himself and yawning dreadfully.] 
JOE (rubbing his eyes). — Heigho I 
I'm so tired! And I'm so 
lazy! 
I've got no work to dot 
And what's more, I 
don't 
want no work to do! 
What's de use o' work ? I 
never could 
see any. 
rother day Ole Massa, he sent me down to de 
Smithy to help at de anvil. 
It was nice and warm in dere ! 
So I 
just curled myself up and laid out for a 
nap. 
Byrn' bye, 
Maksa come along— and he laid out for me! 
Golly, what a 
lickin' I 
did get, to he sure! 
But I'd stand dat sooner dan 
work. 
Says Massa, " Why, Joe," says he, " what are you do-
ing dere, you lazy rascal? What do I 
pay you for ! Why are 
you afraid o' work t " 
"Me afraid o' work. Massa? " I 
says. 
"I ain't afraid o' no work. 
Who says I 
am? 
Who's afraid ? 
Why, Massa, if I 
was afraid a 
work, do you think id lay 
down and go to sleep just by him?" Den Massa had to 
laugh— and-- eh! eh ! (chuckling) dat's de way I 
gets over 'em. 
Dey calls me Lazy Joe! and Yawning Joe! ( Yawns.) 1 
knows 
i'se both. 
But I 
can't help it. 
For when I 
wants to work— 
why as de great pcet Shakespoke wrote—" a 
soft supperation o' 
eke')" gas over me and I 
can't. 
And dat's just what's de 
matter.

UQUET DOYLE. 
Written and sung by JAMES O'NEIL and JACK CONROY. 
I'm a 
masher among the shop girls, 
rcarry on business down town, 
Every morning at eight I 
sit down to eat 
My coffee with doughnuts done brown. 
When I 
pass the girls at me they smile, 
For I 
dress in the latest of style ; 
Shure the boys on the street whenever we meet 
Say, flow de you do, Bouquet Doyle ? 
CHORUS. 
A 
Bouquet, a 
Bouquet I 
always do wear in my coat, 
The pink and white roses, the daisies and posies, 
With perfume I'm ready to choke. 
A 
Bouquet, a 
Bouquet to carry it is my delight, 
The sweet water lily, the daffy. downdilly, 
I 
give to my girl every night. 
Shure I 
drink nothing stronger than milk, 
My necktie is the finest of silk, 
I 
attended every ball at Walla Halla Hall, 
Where the wine like water is spilt ; 
In the dairy, when I 
go to lunch, 
The girls get around in a 
bunch : 
They leave others there to serve nie I 
declare, 
While a 
cranberry tart I 
do munch. 
A 
Bouquet, etc. 
I'm home every night about dawn, 
And l'm up with the lark in the, morn 
Just before dark I 
walk thro' the park 
To feed all the sparrows with corn. 
The Mayor of the city knows me, 
And with him I 
often do dine ; 
Whenever I 
meet a 
bum on the street 
He'll ask me if I 
have a 
dime.

THE PIC-NIC PARTY. 
TnprE. 
Words and Music by GEO. ANDERSON. 
Sung 
by 
MiszEn JONES and Mrs. Jones declared one August day, 
Before the summer was entirely aone they'd have a 
holiday; 
They decided on a 
pie-nic in the woods just out of town, 
And asked all their relations, also young Mr. Brown. 
SPOKEN.—Whoa, Fan! all aboard, ladies. 
Pa, my sponge 
cake isn't done yet. 
Never mind. dear ; bring it along and 
we'll finish it when we get there. 
For— 
cuonus. 
What's more fun than a 
pic-nic party, with the victuals on the 
around? 
Bugs in the butter and ants in the milk and skeeters buzzing 
'round. 
They went in four big carriaaes, and when they reached the 
spot 
They found the ice had melted and the butter was pipiwr hot ; 
The sugar, too, was missing, the spoons were left behind, 
And the handle of the ice-cream pitcher was all that they could 
find. 
SroKEN.—We'll get out here, ladies. 
Oh, dear Mr. Brown, 
do come and kill this horrid spider. 
Aw, never mind, may dealt 
Miss Jones, it can't bite you; and after all— , 
What s 
more, etc. 
Yonne' Mr. Brown, the handsome man, on whom the ladies 
dote, 
Sat riald down in the fryina-pan and burnt his Sunday coat ; 
Bic, fat Jim the booby, moved round like a 
live haystack, 
his femoctl.deked over the lemonade tub, and wet Miss Jones' 
lk  
Spot:Ex.—Ladies, it's time to co home ; Jam4s, remove the 
dog's nose from the dish of sardines. 
Never mind, papa, the 
dog's having a 
good time, don't bother him ; you know how it 
is yourself. 
What's more, etc. 
They broke the plates and spilt the milk and left, it there to 
sour, 
Two lovers walked off in the woods and fooled around for -an 
hour ; 
The horses all got frightened, and reared and plunged and 
kicked, 
And spilt one load out in a 
mud- hole. 
So ended this pie-nic 
SP,

WHEN THE ROBINS NEST AGAIN. 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS in the 
American Four." 
Alter piece. 
I 
WILL return. he said to ine; 
I 
will come back, my love, to thee; 
When nature smiles on land and sea, 
I 
will return again to thee. 
When the robins nest again, 
And the flowers are in bloom,

OYSTERS AND WINE AT 2 A . 
M . 
I'M a 
maiden who never refuses, 
The pleasures that come in my way, 
For now is the time to be merry, 
To be bashful is but to delay; 
When the stars far above us are shining, 
With a 
party of friends, but a 
few, 
Quick the night pass -s 
by and we finish, 
With oysters and wine at 2.

Oh ! yes, ids delightful to me,

And sweet music to ' liven its too, 
While we whisper " good- night,' and then finish 
With oysters and wine at 2. 
Oysters and wine, etc. 
Thro' this wide world where we now are roaming, 
Life calls for excitement and fun, 
So why should we sigh, or feel gloomy, 
For too soon will life's pleasures be done ; 
So then let us be merry while living, 
For it never will do to look blue, 
But still cling to the pleasures delightful, 
And oysters and wine at 2.

BABY'S GOT A TOOTH.

Sung by JAcK Comm-.

father of a 
bouncing boy, 
He looks just like his pa; 
He's the picture of his mamma, 
And the image of his da-da. 
He was eight months old the other day, 
And is a 
noble youth; 
lie has set us almost crazy 
Since he got his first front tooth. 
George, dear! George, dear! 
Can't you guess the truth? 
George, dear! George, dear! 
Bless the little youth! 
Do get up and light the fire; 
Turn the gas up a 
little higher; 
Go and tell your aunt Maria 
Baby's got a 
tooth. 
I 
went home late the other night, 
And soon was sound asleep, 
When suddenly I 
\vas awoke 
By screams that made me weep; 
My wife she grabbed me by the arm, 
And says, " Get up, you brute, 
The pride and joy of all of us - 
Has got a 
nice front tooth." 
George, dear, etc. 
Now, married men, take my advice, 
When first you do get wed, 
Don't ever try to go to Of ep, 
Don't ever go to bed; 
But save yourself from trouble 
With the darling little pet; 
Don't wait until be gets a 
tooth; 
Buy him a 
nice false set.

This little Maggy Ann,

This slick, and entirely bewilderin' young girl,

This rosy Muggy Ann, 
A Vaynus is she, whatever that may be, 
is little Maggy Ann. 
She used to be a 
working-man, 
. Down in a 
laundry tine, 
And wrestle wid discouraged shirts, 
Till wid new life they'd shine, 
But she bekena high- tour, as 
Would any other man, 
And now a 
pure rule Irish nurse, 
Is little Maggy Ann. 
This little Maggy Ann, etc. 
The babies all she washes. 
And then irons them out well, 
And fetches them a 
lively slap, 
If out of tune they yell. 
A 
fancy night-cap then she wears, 
This French Hibernian, 
Then to the Park wid all the babes, 
Glides little Muggy Aim.

I'VE a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems ; 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, . 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prize, • 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
days. 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves — 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave ; 
For the last link that binds me to the place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

Price 40 cents. 
[TeoN the rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon it) spring ; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailing on the lake, 
And all the park was gay ; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way I 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night; 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight ; 
I 
seemed in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat, 
And while his eyes did on me beast, 
I 
heard.his lips repeat, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing ; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear 7 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park." 
We strolled along where roses grew. 
And all was bright and fair; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home; 
They heard my lips reply, 
And stars were bright in yokder dome 
Before we said good-bye. 
(.1') 
3t 
THERE IS NO HARM IN KISSING.—Concluded. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
Its dear bewitching spell ! 
We lingered though the hour was late. 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at tlie gate, 
He softly to me said, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing ; 
. 
Pray tell me, is there, dearl 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing

Gone is the gladness that made life so dear

No smile to cheer me is lingering near I

Dreaming of dear ones who left me in tears,

Loved ones are waiting, then hush all tny fears!"

WE ARE TWO BUSTERS. 
Written by Jos. PETTINGILL of the " American Four." Sung nightly.

are two swells of the day, 
That's what the people all say; 
We live on the air at Madison square; 
We're going to get a 
fortune, 
Ten dollars on a 
share; 
Our money we'll spend at oar ease; 
At parties we're bound to please. 
With our pivoting dance ' 
There's none stands a 
chance 
Like the two Ulster brothers, you see. 
CHORUS. 
Oh we are two busters, look at onr ulsters, 
We are the swells with the glass in our eye; 
We are two babies. killers of ladies, 
And as they pass by us they laugh out, ha, hal

dons. 
Also, by the great " American Four." 
I'LL sing of a 
dainty young man of fashion, 
Who just about now is the style and the rage; 
He looks like a 
donkey and acts like a 
monkey, 
The place to put hint would be a 
big cage. 
His hair is done up in hangs and frizzes; 
A New Jersey lily he smells for food; 
His pants are so tight that it makes the head light 
Of this straw ,e 
freak of fashion, the }Esthetic Dude. 
His collar's so big that it hides his big ears, 
His nose is high toned, for it points to the skies; 
The boys call him Biddy, for he is so giddy, 
And the way he walks you'd think he could fly. 
Now to all young ladies who may want to marry, 
I 
give this advice, so don't think me rude: 
You can't tell if you're hitched to a 
male or a 
female 
If you marry this foolish and mulish young Dude.

HE LOOKS MORE LIKE HIS PA, 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
YOU'LL perceive I 
am feeling quite jovial, 
The reason you never could guess ; 
It's simply because a 
bright cherub, 
My household's appeared in to bless. 
He was seven weeks old but last Sunday, 
And a 
smarter child never was born, 
And they say he looks like his papa, 
But he's crying from night until morn. 
CHORUS. 
He looks more like his pa every day, the young scamp, 
He looks more like his pa every day ; 
And the neighbors all say he has got just my way, 
And looks more like his pa every day. 
Last week was the day of his christening, 
And the people came from near and far, 
To pay their respects to the infant, 
And wish luck to his pa and his ma. 
They'd smother him quite -with -caresses, 
Their love for my offspring was plain, 
And as they our refreshments devoured, 
In a 
chorus they'd loudly exclaim : 
He looks more like his pa, etc, 
In my neighborhood dwells an old maiden, 
She's forty years old if a 
day ; 
And one morn when I 
saw her approaching, 
A 
trick I 
concluded to play. 
(

HE LOOKS MORE LIKE HIS PA .- Concluded 
The old tom cat I 
placed in the cradle, 
With the baby's white cap on his head; 
Miss Slimkins gazed at him quite loving, 
Then turning to me, thus she said : 
He looks more like his pa, etc. 
Miss Slirnkins was greatly insulted, 
In fact she seemed dreadfully riled, 
When I 
threw the tom cat out the .window, 
And produced from the next room the child.. 
When good humor at last she'd recovered, 
With the " kid" on her lap down she sat, 
When all of a 
sudden, oh, 
horror ! 
But the baby he couldn't help that. 
SPOKEN. — Bright colors will always attract a 
child's at-
tention. 
Miss Slimkins wore on her bonnet a 
beautiful 
artificial nosegay, 
The youthful scion of the noble house 
of Dodge suddenly observed it. 
He made a 
quick grab, a 
vigorous yank, off came the old . lady's bonnet, and off 
came her wig, leaving the top of her head as bare as the 
back of my hand. 
She grabbed the " kid " by one leg, 
fired him into the corner, snatched up her wig, slapped it 
upon her naked head, and with eyes fairly glaring, she 
turned round to me, and exclaimed: - 
He looks more like his pa, etc.

Then didn't I 
love the girls, 
And didn't the girls love me: 
But I 
never could keep to one you know, 
Through this infirmity, 
For as soon as Mary Ann 
Had inveigled me with her smile, 
I 
was " off" again to Betsy Jane, 
I 
was so volatile. 
I 
was so volatile, I

I 
never could stop the question to pop,

Then I 
joined the Volunteers, 
And I 
raced the corps for a 
wager; 
But I 
couldn't keep still at the weekly drill, 
In spite of the Sergeant Major. 
And if ever I'm called to fate 
The foe in rank and file, 
I 
very much fear I 
shan't be " near,"

got more active still 
in the course of my career, 
For my Uncle Bill lett me in his will 
Ten thousand pounds a

That my poor relations grieve 
And despair, there's no denial, 
For I 
hear them cry, He never will die, 
He is so volatile. 
Yes, I 
am so volatile, oh, I 
am so volatile, 
They fume and fret, but nothing they'll get 
While I'm so volatile.

But now I'm getting old, 
My hair is thin and grey; 
And my voice is so weak, I 
can hardly speak, 
And I've rheumatiz they say. 
But as for my blessed limbs 
They're just as juvenile, 
For they rigt,gle and riot, and won't keep quiet, 
They are so volatile. 
I 
am so volatile, I 
am so volatile, 
Tho' I'm getting old, yet still I'm told, 
I'm just as volatile.

A WARRIOR BOLD .

IN 
days of old, when knights were bold, 
And barons held their sway, 
A 
warrior bold, with spurs of gold, 
Sang merrily his lay, 
Sang merrily his lay. 
My love is young and fair, 
My love bath golden hair, 
And eyes so blue, and heart so true, 
That none with her compare; 
So what care I 
tho death be nigh, 
I'll live for love, or die, 
So this brave knight, in armor bright, 
Went bravely to the fray; 
He fought the fight, but ere the night 
His soul had passed away, 
His soul had passed away. 
The plighted ring he wore 
Was crushed and wet with gore, 
Yet ere he died, he bravely cried, 
" 
I've kept the vow I 
swore; 
So what care I 
tho' death be nigh— 
I've fought for love, and die."

By the careless flowing fountain, 
Were the ripples of her hair, 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Angels bright, her eyes so winning, 
Angels bright her happy smile, 
And beneath the fountain spinning, 
You could hear her song the while—

My boots I 
left, down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs ; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares ; 
But just as I

I 
seemed•to get lost in the dark , 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor.

If she'd let me alone for awhile ;

LOVE. 
Composed by IlArant- BENNETT, mid sung 
CARTER. 
Oh, love is such a 
very funny thing, 
with success by Bala 
And it catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of _ boarding housG hash, 
And many a 
man it has sold! 
It makes you feel like a 
fresh water eel, 
And causes your head to swell; 
You lose your mind, for love is blind, 
And it empties your pocket book as well. 
Cum:us. 
Boys keep away from the gals, I 
say, 
Give them lots of room, 
Or you'll find when you're wed, 
They will bang you till you're dead 
With bald headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man is gone on a 
pretty little gal, 
1-Ie talks just as gentle as a 
dove; 
lie spends all his money, and calls her his honey, 
For to show her he is solid on his love. 
When his money is gone and his clothes in hock, 
lie finds the old saying it is true, 
That a 
mole on the arm is worth two on the leg, 
But what is he going for to do. 
Boys keep away, * W., 
When married folks have lots of cash, 
Their love is firm and strong, 
But when they have to feed on hash, 
Their love don't last so long. 
With a 
wife and seventeen half starved kids, 
I 
tell you it's no fun, 
When your butcher comes around to collect his bill, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrel gun. 
Boys keep away, eta, 
Young fellows just take my advice, • 
Don't be in a 
hurry for to wed, 
You think you're in clover till the honey- moon's over, 
And Then you'll think you're dead. 
With a 
cross eyed baby on each knee, 
And a 
wife with a 
plaster on her noir, 
You'll find true love don't run so very- smooth. 
When you have to wear your second liand cloth- s. 
Boys keep away, etc. 
When the rent is high, and the kids all cry 
Because there's no grub to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son 
To load up your gun, 
While you vaccinate mother-in-law.

THE band was playing in the park 
One August evening fine, 
And crowds of promenaders gay 
Were marching by in line ; 
The fellows in full force were there, 
The aids were plenty, too, 
And with flirtations, chats, and such, 
All had enough to do. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
was harnessed to my love, 
Who now and then would say, 
" 
That lady seems to know you, George, 
Who is she, tell me, pray 7" 
The ladies, bless the gentle doves, 
All seemed to how to me, 
Which, with Louisa by my side, 
Did not at all agree ; 
And one, believe it, nudged me hard, 
I 
did not know her name, 
Or even the direction which 
The little damsel came. 
But I 
was, etc. 
I 
told my love that it was rude, 
For we'd ne'er met before, 
And then I 
said, " I'm sure she's uot 
The style that I 
adore." 
Besides, I 
thought her impudent 
For doing such a 
thing, 
And their the band struck up the air 
My darling loved to sing. 
But I 
was, etc. 
se•arce had got the sentence out 
When, lo, behold! there stood 
A 
maidien throwing kisses just 
As fast as e'er she could ; 
She aimed them all at me I 
know, 
For in her roguish eve 
1-:P.‘%"twas her intention. then 
To toss them on the sly. 
But I 
was, etc. 
" THAT LADY SEEMS TO KNOW YOU, 
GEORGE ? "—Concluded. 
Apologize again I 
must 
To my Louisa fair, 
Lest she should think that I 
for her 
.Did not the slightest care ; 
I 
told her jokingly I 
thought 
The kisses flew too high 
For me or any other chap 
To catch them on the fly. 
This rather 'vexed the little one, 
She wanted to go home, 
She was " so tired and sleepy that 
She could no further roam 
But ' ere we reached her domicile, 
A 
girl bewitching sweet, 
Said, as she passed aside us, ' George, 
Neat Sunday night we meet." 
But I 
was, etc.

DON'T FORGET TO BE KIND TO THE BOYS. 
Written expressly for LPTTLE BOB by BEN DOD*E. 
There is something which I 
wish to mention to you, 
While trying to please with my song ; 
Some solid advice unto you I 
will give; 
Please listen, it's not very long. 
Your attention I'll call to the poor little boys 
You will meet on the street every day, 
Do not spurn them aside with a 
curse or a 
kick, 
When by chance they are thrown in your way. 
enonus. 
Don't think they're too small to be noticed at all, 
Let them share in your sorrows and joys, 
Their love will repay your kindness some day. 
Don't forget to be kind to the boys. 
If a 
poor boy accosts you while trying to earn 
By honest means but half a 
dime, 
If you have it to spare, buy a 
paper at once, 
Or invest when he proffers a 
shine. 
He has loved ones at home who upon him depends 
For the poor crusts of bread which they eat; 
And the brave, honest boy, to provide them with food, 
Ifas to labor each day in the street. 
Don't think they're too small, etc. 
The greatest of statesmen were once small like me, 
And no one can tell what's in store 
For a 
boy in the future, if upright he proves, 
No matter if now he is poor. 
So, unheeded, don't pass the advice which I 
give, 
But by your applause let me see 
That you promise to ever be kind to boys, 
And I 
hope you'll begin here with me. 
Don't think they're too small, etc.

Tell them that wher'er I 
wander, 
Sweet thoughts arise of home, 
With the lovid ones ffather'd there; 
Give my love te all at home. 
Give my love, etc. 
. Give my love to all at home ; 
To the lov'd ones say for me, 
That I'm lonely from them now, 
Lonely now as I 
can be; 
Take to them my fondest wishes, 
To them now safe at home, 
And this message from my heart, 
Give my love to all at home. 
Give my love, etc.

2. 
Reverses in business brought me to a 
stand: 
found very soon I 
should smash: 
My friends advised me to fly from the land, 
And seize upon all my loose cash: 
But my reputation was dearer to me 
Than all the bright gold in my till, 
So I 
paid what I 
owed and proudly I 
said, 
If I'm poor, I'm a 
gentleman still.— Cho. 
3. 
One evening last week. the other end of the town, 
Whilst wandering sadly : doicr, 
I 
picked up a 
purse that a 
lady had dropped, 
The temptation to keep it was strong. 
My pockets were empty, but firmly I 
said. 
She shall have her own conic what will; 
She looked at my dross as I 
gave it and said, 
"If you're poor, you're a 
gentleman still."— Cho. 
4. 
Last evening I 
rescued a 
poor homeless girl 
Whom a 
swell was insulting: I 
found 
My strength for the moment was something immense, 
As I 
hurled the "Teat brute to the, ground. 
lie cried out, " you be"-"
.
.ar, don't meddle with me 
Or very soon you'll get a 
pill." 
But I 
said. " lay a 
hand on that girl and you'll find

YOU MAY LOOK, BUT YOU MUSTN'T TOUCH. 
Sung with overwhelming success by HARRY M ONTAGUE. 
Music of this song can be obtained at SPEAR & DEIINELOTF, 717 Broad-
way, New York, HARRY M ONTA.GUE'S SE41C publishers. 
When I 
was a 
boy, a 
mischievous elf, 
I 
had a 
very bad habit of helping myself ; 
My mother put every thing out of my way, 
And well I 
remember these words she would say : 
CHORUS. 
You may look, but you mustn't touch, 
Mutsn't touch, keep your hands off, 
You're inclined to be a 
little forward, 
Now don't be so rude. 
(
Repeat.) 
At eight years of age, although not a 
fool, 
I 
went every day, of course, to my school. 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be, 
So the school teacher gave the old lecture to me : 
You may look, etc. 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too staid, 
I 
dared not embrace her, or ask for a 
kiss, 
If I 
did, the reply from my love would be this : 
You may look, etc. 
When we were engaged, I 
said, No one could blame, 
So her scruples in that way I 
soon overcame. 
This dear little darling, I 
married one day ; 
When I 
now want a 
kiss, you will not hear her say : 
You may look; c

SHE LAUGHED BEHIND HER FAN. 
Words by HARRY HuNTEn. 
Music by F. HULLEN. 
rubli.ihed by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I MET her at a 
ball 
As beautiful as day. 
Of graceful figure, slight and tall, 
And hair like golden spray. 
I 
said this is a 
happy chance, 
And I'm a 
happy man, 
And as I 
led her out to dance 
She laughed behind her fan. 
CHORUS. 
She laughed behind her fan, 
And said " You naughty man, 
You shouldn't do so, it's wrong, you know !" 
And laughed behind her fan. 
We danced the Lancers and Quadrille, 
Then rested for a 
while, 
But once we nearly had a 
spill, 
Through some one's clumsy style. 
I 
clasped her waist more tightly then, 
'Twas neat and sweet to span, 
And wheir her eyes met mine again, 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, etc. 
I 
saw her to the carriage door, 
When it was time to leave, 
I 
fancied, but I 
wasn't sure, 
She slightly pressed my sleeve, 
I 
squeezed her hand, the old resource, 
The good old-fashioned plan, 
And as she felt the gentle force 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed, eta 
I 
saw her in a 
month or so, 
One Christmas party night, 
And then beneath the mistletoe 
I 
claimed the season's rite. 
She said ' Oh, dear ! my husband's here, 
I'm sure you never can !" 
And I 
felt queer, for much I 
fear 
She laughed behind her fan. 
She laughed,

IT DON'T BELONG TO ME.—Concluded. 
IT DON'T BELONG TO ME. 
iting with great success by Hariny MoNTAuuz. 
You see I 
am so very good, I 
never claim a 
thing 
That don't belong to me, you know, for that would be a 
sin ; 
I 
assure you I 
am honest and as truthful as can be, 
And I 
wouldn't think of picking up what don't belong to 
me. 
While walking down the street one day, by a 
policeman 
I 
was stopped, 
Who said, " I 
think this purse, young man, from your 
coat pocket dropped 
Now, as I 
never carry one, I've so little cash, you see, 
Like an honest man, I 
said at once, " It don't belong to 
me." 
' CHORUS. 
It don't belong to me, it don't belong to-me, 
You'd better inquire of somebody else, it don't belong 
to me ; 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you seQ, 
I 
know nothing whatever about it, it don't belong tc, 
me. 
My wages being very small, ; live in quiet style, 
But with the girls I 
1A-c/e-duk, and the agony I 
pile ; 
( 
1 ) 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I've got lots of cheek, 
They little think I 
do the grand on eight and a 
half per 
week. 
One day I 
bought a 
waffle, which I 
popped inside my hat, 
For I 
saw a 
lady coming along and I 
knew she'd stop and 
chat 
My hat blew off, the waffle fell out, the street boys 
laughed with glee, 
But when they brought it back I 
said, " It don't belong 
to me." 
I 
never saw that waffle before, etc. 
I 
occupied a 
front room in a 
house not far up town, 
And in the back room lived a 
girl, whose name was Jenny 
Brown, 
"Whene'er I'd chance to meet her, well, I'd pass the time 
of day, 
And have a 
little talk with her, in a 
friendly sort of way. 
The other night when I 
got home, oh what a 
dreadful 
scene, 
And my landlady asked of .rae, " Now, what does all this 
mean ? 
" 
Miss Brown has gone, but left behind this bundle, as 
you see. 
Said I, " You quite surprise me, but it don't belong to 
me." 
I 
never saw the bundle before, etc.

THE ABSENT-MINDED MAN. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Ctipyrighted, 1879, by CLINTON T. 
Dx W ITT. 
I'LL tell ye a 
story of a 
curious man, 
To entertain ye this evening I'll do what I 
can. 
He was a 
distant relation to bow-legged Sam, 
His nose was as 'red as a 
sugar-cured ham, 
And his name was Patrickardo McManahan. 
But he had a 
queer and a 
troublesome fault, 
Like a 
2.40 trotter that has the springhalt ; 
He was quite absent-minded at certain times, 
He'd execute some peculiar unforeseen monkey shines. 
SPOKEN.—Caused by, as several of our learned phy-
sicians informed me, the all-powerful and predominating 
effects coming together and making as it were an absent-
minded man. 
For instance, some morning he'd arise from his bed, 
And in place of a 
hat put a 
pail on his head ; 
Sometimes he'd imagine that he was the-Mayor, 
Or at work for the city as county wind-weigher. 
And he'd dwell on his influence, wealth, and high station, 
With moral presumption and great exultation ; 
He'd speak with disdain on Chinese emigration, 
And at certain periods would merit extreme approbation, 
SroKEs.--And all due to the effect and misfortune of 
being an absent-minded man. 
THE ABSENT-MINDED MAN .- Concluded. 
But he was known and respected all over the town ; 
In his elegant barouche he rode grandly around, 
For he thought at one time he was General Grant's son, 
And he fell in convulsions at the sound of a 
gun. 
He went to a 
pic-nic and got bilin' full, 
And filled the bass drum with molasses candy pull ; 
He sang the Star Strangled Hammer with the greatest of 
ease, 
And read the Declaration of Independence from the fly-
ing,trapeze ; 
He lost a 
one thousand dollar diamond, the police tried 
to find it, 
Well, if you believe that, you must be absent-minded. 
But it was very seldom he got on a 
spree; 
When he couldn't drink coffee he always drank tea ; 
He had an old Spitz dog and a 
bullfoundland pup, 
And at eating and biting they both took the cup. 
He went to the circus, got drinking hard cider, 
And thought he was one of the bare-back horse riders 
He split the. tent open in making his leap, 
And fell down on his neck about two hundred feet ; 
With his eyes full of sawdust and very near blinded, 
He says Patrickardo McAlanahan, you must be absent-
minded.

THE FIFTH AVENUE FAIR . 
Written by BEN COLLINS, of TURNER ct COLLINS, and sung by 
TONY PASTOR with great success. 
IF 
you will listen awhile to the song I 
will sing, 
I 
will tell you some funny and curious things ; 
It isn't Whoa Emma i 
or our Front Stoop, 
Nor my My Mary Ann, for she has the croup ; 
it ; tint Where was Moses, or the Isle De Blackwell, 
But I'm sure when you've heard it your head it will swell. 
So list to the words and don't mind the air, 
And I'll tell you about the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
Susan B. Anthony, she had a 
stand, 
And was selling cheap tickets for the promised land ; 
Mary WAker was there, but, got full of booze, 
And they raffled her off with O'Leary's big shoes. 
Dennis Kearney was talking to Moody and Sank, 
Fixing a 
job on the Manhattan Bank ; 
Owney Geoghegan came in with bear grease on his hair, 
And was too sweet to live at the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
There was bald-headed babies and lively mammas, 
Ancient old maidens and half full papas ; 
Two blushing young girls had a 
boxing glove fight, 
And said Francis Murphy was a 
little bit tight. 
Mrs. Jinks she got up for a 
temperance speech, 
But she fell through the floor with a 
terrible screech 
Harry Hill he rushed in with a 
rush-bottomed chair, 
But they all rushed him out at the Fifth Avenue Fair. 
Hughes, the pedestrian, started to walk, 
All the widows sat down for r 
long-winded talk ; 
Gallant Ben Butler got in on a 
check, 
Two song and dance men got in on their neck. 
The hero of Baxter street waltzed a 
quadrille, 
A 
deaf and dumb man was talking to handsome Tom 
Gill ; 
Dr. Talmage was sleeping in Washington Square, 
And missed all the sin at the Fifth Avenue Fair.
