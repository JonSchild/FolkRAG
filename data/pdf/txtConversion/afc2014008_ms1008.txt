The National Endowment for the Arts, t
hrough its Folk Arts
 
Programs, welcomes you t
o the 1
990 Heritage Fellowship celebration.  This i
s t
he
 
n
inth such occasion and -
-
 a
s always -
-
 it is designed to be a joyous recognition
 
of the creativity and d
iversity t
o be found amongst the traditional arts and artists
 
of t
he United States.
 
This year there are thirteen artists to be honored from twelve
 
states, s
peaking altogether more than e
ight l
anguages.  There are five mu ical
 
instrumentalists, four crafts workers, two singers, four dancers, one poet, one
 
s
tory t
eller and two orchestras.
 (
The discrepancy in numbers is caused by t
he
 
fact t
hat so many traditional artists are actually multi-talented.  Dancers sometimes
 
s
ing a
s well, musicians may construct their own instruments, crafts workers t
ell
 
stories.)  They c
ome from Hawaii to the west and New Jersey to the east, Puerto
 
Rico t
o t
he south, and Montana to t
he north.  Every one of them is an authentic
 
and exquisitely skilled practitioner of an art form traditional to their own
 
particular h
eritage, a
nd e
very one of them has contributed something of e
special value
 
t
o t
hat art form.
 
They have been nominated by t
heir neighbors, by other artists,
 
by scholars, by tribal or e
thnic associations, by ordinary artisans.  The procedures

e now have more t
han 2
00 nominations in our files and each year they are  joined
 
by newly identified and n ame  artists from across the nation.
 
It takes t
hree gruelling days each spring for an especially assembled
 
panel of experts from many artistic disciplines and many cultural backgrounds t
o l
isten
 
and l
ook at the art work that i
s presented before the Heritage panel, and it i
s
 
sometimes acutely painful to reach a final selection from so many outstanding and
 
d
eserving aritsts.  But our panelists seem to be refreshed by the exercise; perhaps
 
s
imple because of their t
emporary i
r
runersion in the glowing excitement of the multi-
c
ultural d
isplays t

he e
xperience exhausted
 
but e
nergized, o
ver-powered but truly and deeply moved.
 
The Polk Arts Program is proud to once again present t
o t
he American
 
people a sampling of t

NHF CONGRESSIONAL RECEPTION
 
10:00a. m.  SENATE CAUCUS ROOM
 
SEPTEMBER 26,  1990
 
D R
A F T
 
On behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts,  which I am
 
privileged to chair,  I should like first of all to thank the
 
distinguished Honorary Committee of Senators and Congressmen who
 
are sponsoring this ceremony and this reception.
 We are grateful
 
for your hospitality and appreciative of your attention and the
 
honor you thereby pay the work we do.
 We next want to thank the
 
Joseph Martinson Memorial Fund and the Philip B.  Schoch Bequest
 
for helping make this  reception possible.
 
Most of all,  however,  we wish to thank the remarkable
 
assemblage of traditional artists you see before you for their
 
long-standing services to the arts and the nation.
 Each one
 
meets the criteria established by the National Heritage
 
Fellowship program.
 Each is an authentic practitioner of a
 
traditional art form.
 Each has created an ongoing record of
 
serious artistic accomplishment that is worthy of national
 
recognition.
 Each demonstrates the skillfulness,  the economy
 
of  line and movement and phrase,  the purposeful ease that
 
marks the true master of an art.
 
But each one of these artists stands for more than simply
 
his or her individual accomplishments,  notable though they may
 
be.
 Each one represents a group of human beings who through
 
time have poured their creative energies  into the invention and
 
development of a particular artistic form--a unique style of
 
dancing,  a special way of singing,  a characteristic pattern of
 
- 2 -
visual elements.
 These various artistic languages--if I may so
 
*

4
 characterize them--contend peaceably together in our remarkable
 
nation,  vying primarily just for our attention,  and creating a
 
colorful,  continually changing, mosaic across the land that
 
reflects the actual state of our Union.
 
I
 
It seems especially appropriate and fitting therefore that
 
these awards be presented in the presence of representatives of
 
the United States Congress and in one of their own meeting rooms,
 
for the Congress too brings together into one body repre-
sentatives of the many.
 Let me introduce you to the artistic
  
representatives of the people of the United States themselves,
 
nominated by their fellow citizens and selected by still other
 
fellow citizens.
 It is with great pride that I present National
 
Fellowship certificates to the following traditional folk
 
artists:
 
--from Detroit, Michigan,  an articulate and accomplished
 
performer of vocals,  fiddle,  guitar and mandolin music,
 
known to many of his fans by his

excellence in the art of Mexican-American mariachi music,  the
 
National Endowment for the Arts honors--SR.  NATIVIDAD CANO.
 
--from Belleville,  New Jersey,  a remarkable couple both of
 
whom -
 in distinctive ways -
 have preserved and advanced
 
in their new country the poetic and musical traditions
 
of Calabria,  their Italian birthplace.

going contributions to artistic excellence in the
 
traditional performing arts of rural southern Italy,
 
the National Endowment for the Arts honors--MR.  GIUSEPPE
 
DE FRANCO, MRS.  RAFFAELA DE FRANCO.

butions to the art of cowboy poetry,  the National Endowment
 
for the Arts honors--MR. WALLACE MCRAE.

 Thank you Charles.
 Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome
 
to the celebration of the National Heritage
 
Fellowships sponsored by the Folk Arts Program at
 
the National Endowment for the Arts.
 Although
 
this is the ninth such group to be honored, some
 
of you in the audience--like me--may be attending
 
this joyful event for the first time.
 So let me
 
briefly explain just what it is that we are doing
 
here tonight and who is doing it.
 I work at the
 
National Endowment for the Arts,  a federal agency
 
created by the Congress in 1965 "to encourage and
 
assist the nation's cultural resources."  And in
 
our official mission statement, we say:
 
Throughout the ages humankind has striven to
 
go beyond the limits of the immediate
 
physical world to create that which was not
 
there before and thus nourish the human
 
spirit...  It is through art that we can
 
understand ourselves and our potential.  And
 
it is through art that we will be understood
 
and remembered by those who will come after
 
us .

Our first honoree, Robert Spicer, has been dancing
 
and teaching this subtle style for years.
 He 's
 
come here from Dickson, Tennessee to show us just
 
how it goes.  Mr. Spicer could you and your family
 
show us a little bit?
 
LIGHTS UP ON SPICERS; EACH DANCER TAXES A TURN TO FIDDLE MUSIC
 
KURALT
 Mr. Spicer is here with some of his family
 
tonight.
 His son-in--law, Carl Franklin, plays
 
fiddle and dances too.
 Then there's Mr. Spicer s
 
two daughters, Diane Franklin and Judy Street,  and
 
his grandson Roby Street.
 That was Mr. Spicer
 
himself clapping and directing the dance.
 Their
 
friends Don Stover and  
 
are accompanying.
 
Now, Mr. Spicer,  if you could come over and visit
 
with me for a minute while your family catches
 
their breath...
 I understand that you have taught
 
not only your family but more dancers than you can
 
count.
 How did you learn yourself?
 
8
 
KURALT
 
Do you have any idea how many dancers you have
 
taught?
 I understand when you teach, you just
 
accompany the dancers with your hand clapping?
 
Could you show us your hand clap and explain about
 
it a little?
 Is it true you change the clap a
 
little for each dancer?
 
What do you think is the single most important
 
thing for a flat foot dancer to remember?  What
 
makes a dancer especially good?
 
I surely would like to see some more...
 Could you
 
go over and do another round with your family .nd
 
SPICERS
 DANCE
 
KURALT
 You know,  I
'm from North Carolina,  in the same
 
general area where the Spicers live,  and I confess
 
I get a special kind of twist of the heart muscle
 
when I hear the kind of music and see the kind of
 
dance I grew up around.
 It means the people and
 
the place where I was born.
 And that is what most
 
9
 
KURALT
 folk art does.
 It actually seems to stand for a
 
group of people and a way of life.
 There is some
 
kind of visceral connection...
 
Our next artist comes from the Hawaiian Islands,
 
and she has developed to an extraordinary degree
 
an art form that "means" Hawaii wherever you see
 
it--the flower necklace--the lei.
 
The Polynesian seafarers who settled the Hawaiian
 
Islands fifteen centuries ago seem to have brought
 
the idea of the lei with them [and used all kinds
 
of materials to make them--shells, plants, seeds,
 
feathers.
 Today, except on the barren island of
 
Ni'ihau where shell leis are still made, most
 
Hawaiian leis are made of flowers,]  and leis
 
continue to be absolutely central to Hawaiian life
 
and custom.
 [They greet strangers and friends,
 
they say farewell,they honor the birthday
 
celebrant, the wedding couple, the host, the guest
 
and--most reverently -
 the dead.]
 
Forty years ago, the impact of large eastern and
 
western cultures had almost driven out the art of
 
KURALT
 
-
 10 -
 
lei making in Hawaii.
 Our next honoree, Marie
 
MacDonald, spearheaded a movement to reinstate
 
this fragile art into its essential place in
 
Hawaiian life.
 Today she continues to function as
 
scholar, educator and--preeminently--an artist of
 
lei making.
 You will see her breath-taking
 
constructions as we talk together.
 Please
 
welcome--Mrs. Marie MacDonald
 
Mrs. MacDonald,  it seems that lei making is an
 
especially personal personal art form.
 What do
 
you think about first when you begin to make a
 
lei?  The person it's for?  The materials you have
 
at hand?  The particular occasion?
 
I heard somewhere that fragrance is especially
 
important to you.
 Do you choose your materials
 
for fragranace or color or texture?  What is most
 
critical in lei making?
 
How long might it take you to make an average
 
lei---or the quickest kind as compared to the most
 
elaborate longest kind?

mountains managed to survive all these invaders,
 
in the process developing song forms of great
 
poetic beauty, both lullabyes and choral songs
 
sung in characteristically intense strident
 
open-throated intervals.
 
We are grateful to our next honorees--Guiseppe and
 
Raffaela De Franco--for maintaining their ancient
 
art in the Italian neighborhoods of Belleville,
 
New Jersey where they now live.
 It is an art
 
wildly different from the lyric prettiness of the
 
finiculi-finicula world of Italian American
 
popular music.
 It is an art that demonstrates the
 
eternal capacity of humanity to produce poetry out
 
of hardship.
 
Mr. and Mrs. De Franco will be accompanied by
 
their son, Faust de Franco,  and by their friends
 
Frank Cafone, Antonio de Giacomi and Barnbina and
 
Angelo Luzzi.

(GOES TO THEM)  Mr. De Franco was telling me
 
before the program that this instrument is a
 
guitarra battente, a kind of early guitar that is
 
made in only one place in the entire world--the
 
town right next to his, back home.  And his son
 
Faust here is playing a very ancient instument
 
called the triccaballacca.
 I believe now Faust
 
will accompany his father while he plays on the
 
cane flute that he used to amuse himself with when
 
he was a little boy herding goats on the hillsides.

DANCE OFF
 
KURALT
 
We introduce now an artist from a culture as old
 
and perhaps even older than the Calabrians, but
 
one that has sprung from this corner of the
 
globe.
 Mrs. Maude Kegg comes from northern
 
Minnesota, and she is a craftswoman of enormous
 
distinction.
 She is also a leading
 
tradition-bearer of her tribe--the Anishinaabe
 
Indians of the Mu le Lacs Reservation.
 
Anishinaabe means "first or original people better
 
known to what outsiders often call Chippewa and
 
sometimes Ojibwe--all simply different spellings
 
for the same thing: a remarkable group of people
 
who invented, centuries ago, the means necessary
 
to survive in this region of fierce winters,
 
swampy springs and brief, though fruitful, summers.

KURALT
 
Mrs. Kegg is an elder who is held in honor by her
 
people and the outside world alike,  for she has
 
personally continued the crafts traditional to her
 
foreparents and she has generously given of her
 
wisdom to instruct others.
 She is as the scholar
 
Ralph Coe says,  "a stalwart spirit--always doing
 
and making thins the right way."  Ladies and
 
gentlemen, may I introduce--MRS. MAUDE KEGG.
 
Mrs. Kegg, how do you what is the "right way"?  Do
 
you remember people who taught you the right way
 
and kept you from the wrong way?  How did they do
 
this?
 
You are competent in so many crafts.
 Is there one
 
that seems to you especially important?  Perhaps
 
beadwork? Leatherwork? Bark?
 
Is there something you often say to young Ojibwas
 
who may want to study with you?
 
I think I
've often seen American Indian designs
 
that are sort of geometric, but much of your
 
beadwork has more curved flower designs and
 
-

KURALT
 butterflies.
 Are flowers and butterflies
 
especially important to the Ojibway people?
 
Is there something you often say to visitors when
 
you are showing them your work at the Mu le Lacs
 
Museum?
 
Is there something you believe that young people
 
in general should hear and can learn from this?
 
KURALT
 One of the great musical repertoires of the entire
 
world is made up of the narrative songs of the
 
British Isles that are soemtimes called "Child
 
ballads" because in the 1880's and 90's a Harvard
 
professor named James Francis Child origonally
 
assembled them from ancient manuscripts into a
 
single collection.
 But professor Child didn't
 
seems to realize that those songs were still being
 
sung, and that was because he only looked at old
 
papers and never though to visit Laurel and Sodom
 
counties in Western North Carolina.
 
-
 18 -  
KURALT
 What had happened was that during the 17th and
 
18th centuries British soldiers and explorers
 
roamed the world.  And wherever they settled down,
 
the songs in their heads settled too, because the
 
stories those songs told were just so downright
 
basic, they couldn't be left at home.
 
Our next honoree, Doug Wallin, comes from Laurel
 
County, North Carolina where many ballad-singing
 
families settled in the 17th century, and he
 
learned his songs from his mother and father and
 
his uncle and his neighbors, the old fashioned
 
way,just listening to them.  He learned to sing
 
them the old-fashioned way, too.  He is a quiet
 
man who doesn't put on a big show.
 Sometimes he
 
drones a little on his fiddle, but mostly he just
 
stands there and sings and gets out of the way of
 
the story, speaking the words out plain so that
 
you can ride that story right back through the
 
centuries in your own imagination.  Ladies and
 
gentlemen, the great ballad singer, holder of his
 
own states Folk Heritage award, MR. DOUG WALLIN.

Mr.  Wallin,  I understand you come from the
 
country that Tom Dooley lived in and that
 
you know one of the old ways that great
 
song was sung before the Kingston Trio got
 
hold of  it.
 Could you let us hear it?

 TOM DOOLEY

 Now exactly how did all that sad story
 
come about?
 Was Tom Dooley a Civil War
 
veteran or something?
 Wasn't there
 
something about a lady -
-
 or two  ladies
 
being involved?
 
I heard that when that wicked woman died
 
some terrible things happened
 
WALL IN
 
KURALT
 Now that all happened pretty recently in our
 
history but I believe you know some songs
 
that tell about things that happened way
 
back.
 Could you sing one of those old songs
 
that your family may have brought over from
 
Great Britain?
 How about The House
 
Carpenter?

Bess Hawes tells me that one of the best reasons
 
for working in the Folk Arts Program is that you
 
never can possible get bored -
-
 there is always
 
something totally different just waiting to be
 
heard and seen.
 From the exquisite economy of the
 
solo British ballad tradition we move to the
 
exuberent complexity of one of the great
 
orchestral traditional of the western
 
hemisphere--the mariachi. 
Mariachi music originated on the ranches and in
 
the small towns around Guadalajara in west central
 
Mexico.
 The rich legacy of string instruments
 
brought from Spain during colonial days had been
 
transformed over time into many regional types of
 
small string orchestra.
 The mariachi was but one
 
of these orchestral types until the 1930's when
 
the trumpet was added, and booming radio and film
 
industries brought mariachi music into the lives
 
of people all over Mexico.
 Today, most of the
 
best musicians still come from small towns and
 
ranches, and mariachi music has become one of the
 
signatures of Mexican identity, a symbol of Mexican

You know, there are some people who believe that
 
the characteristic dance of the United States is
 
the square dance, and it certainly is a dance that
 
is enjoyed by a great many people.
 But there are
 
other folks who say that for every square there
 
are at least five polkas being danced somewhere,
 
and they point especially to the so-called "polka
 
belt" -
 a region that takes in most of the top
 
right-hand quarter of the United States from New
 
England right through to the western borders of
 
the Dakotas, maybe even down to Texas and over to
 
the Rockies.
 In the polka belt dancers simply
 
insist on dancing to live music and their own
 
special live music at that.
 So if you began at
 
the eastern end of the polka belt and danced your
 
way right through into Montana, one night you be
 
dancing to Polish polka music and another to
 
Ukranian, and another to Czech.  And when you got
 
to northern Michigan -
 thanks to our next honoree
 
-
 Mr. Arthur Moilanen, you would be dancing to a
 
great repertoire of Finnish dance tunes.
 
-
 22 -  
KURALT
 Mr. Moilanen has come to us tonight from Mass City
 
Michigan where he plays these lovely and seldom
 
heard Finnish melodies -
-
 polkas,  and the polka's
 
best friend, waltzes -
 almost every night in one
 
dance hail or another.
 He is a master of an
 
enormous repertoire of accordion music from
 
country-western to early swing, but he always
 
includes the Finnish melodies of his forbears.
 
These are sweet tunes, and we've persuaded him to
 
play a few of them tonight -
 and maybe even sing a
 
verse or two if he's in the mood.
 Mr. Moilanen
 
has brought his friend  -
 Tom Hitunen -
 to
 
accompany him on the guitar.
 Please welcome them.

 In the 19th and early 20th centuries, new settlers
 
inthis country were apt to have come from Europe;
 
nowadays, they are more likely to be from Latin
 
America--or in many places--from Asia.
 Since no
 
group ever came here empty-handed, culturally
 
speaking,  it is exciting to think how rich in
 
world-wide artistic traditions we soon will
 
be--indeed, we already are.

KURALT
 
Our next honoree is from southeast Asia.
 From the
 
country of Cambodia where she spent her early life
 
mastering the multiple skills required to become a
 
weaver of silk.  Madame Em Bun's maternal
 
grandparents had always been the weavers for their
 
village; even in her childhood, machine-made cloth
 
was rare and the yards of silk required for
 
religious and celebratory wear simply had to be
 
made by hand.  Em Bun was a talented child and she
 
worked hard.
 Today, in her new adopted homeland,
 
Madame Em Bun still works hard, producing the
 
lengths of silk necessary to make a traditional
 
Cambodian skirt, teaching her daughters and other
 
young women her delicate art.
 She normally
 
dresses her loom -
-
 to give you an idea of the
 
fineness of the work -
-
 with 3500 different single
 
warp threads.
 
Madame Em Bun's daughter has come with her to
 
translate for her mother, and between the two
 
ladies, we may be able to see how they shine the
 
threads with tapioca and coconut oil, and how they
 
wind the skeins of silk threads onto the rotating

KURALT
 swift from which it is wound into cones for
 
eventual transfer onto the loom itself.
 
Please welcome a craftswoman of outstanding skill
 
and dedication, MADAME EM BUN
 
KURALT
 Madame, could you give us any idea of how long it
 
might take to dress your loom for weaving a
 
particular pattern? How many hours might the
 
weaving take?
 
Could you show us how the swift works and what the
 
comes are like?
 
Are ther particular colors that are expecially
 
popular amongst Cambodian ladies?  Some, perhaps,
 
that are especially used for wedding clothes or
 
religious events?
 
I am told that when you weave, the sound you make
 
with the beater firming up the cloth is different
 
from anyone else 's.
 Does it remind you of your
 
mother?  Did you learn how it should sound from
 
-
 25 -  
KURALT
 her?  Where do you get your silk from?
 Is it as
 
good a quality as you used to have at home?  If
 
you were able to raise your own silk-worms could
 
you make better raw silk?  How do you get the
 
sheen of the cloth?
 
In general traditional arts are learned by a
 
process of observation and imitation; it is a good
 
way because it makes the learner take an active
 
responsibility of learning, but it is a slow way,
 
no doubt about that.  And the long years required
 
to perfect these skills--generally result in our
 
master folk artist's being a little what a friend
 
of mine calls "ageable.T

In John Frohninayer's opening remarks he mentioned
 
that through the ages human beings have tried to
 
create things that were not there before, to add
 
something new and exciting or calming or inspiring
 
to day-to-day life.  Nowhere, it seems to me, is
 
that eternal impulse more clear than in the craft
 
of woodcarving.
 Some carving is functional, of
 
course, but most of the whittlers I know seem to
 
take their delight in just making something new,
 
something that was not there before.  And
 
remarkably often, what they make is a bird.
 
(Some carvers make duck decoys, of course, but
 
often they appear to make them more to look at and
 
enjoy with the eyes than to shoot over.  Other
 
carvers made cranes and sandpipers and humming
 
birds, plump partridges, and swooping gulls.)
 
Our next honoree makes roosters--lovely sweeping
 
long-lined brightly painted roosters.
 He carves
 
other animals, too, and Santos, and Three Kings
 
statues, but he is most widely known in his home
 
island of Puerto Rico for his brilliant sequence
 
-
 28 -  
KURALT
 
of rooster carvings which have, for many, come to
 
be a national symbol for Puerto Rico.
 He has
 
journeyed here from the town of Utuado,  inland, on
 
the western end of the island, where he raises his
 
birds and has his studio, bringing with him his
 
long-time friend and supporter, the eminent
 
scholar of Puerto Rican crafts, Dr. Walter Murray
 
Chiesa to act as translator.
 Please now welcome
 
the master Puerto Rican wood carver, Senor Emilio
 
Ros ado.
 
KURALT
 (EXAMINES SOME OF THE BIRDS THEY BRING ON STAGE)
 
Is one of these a favorite of yours?  Did you copy
 
this one from a live bird or did it come out of
 
your imagination?
 
Do you name your birds--your live ones?  Your
 
carved ones?
 
Have you taught any young person your carving
 
skills?
 
-
 29 -  
KURALT
 Are there many carvers in Puerto Rico?  Does
 
anyone else carve roosters like you?
 
What do most of your carving friends need--places
 
to sell?
 tools?  materials?  exhibit halls?
 
What kind of wood do you like to use?
 Is it easy
 
to get?
 
Do you like to carve anywhere else than your
 
shop?
 I understand it smells beautifully cedar...
 
could you work as well away from your home place
 
and your home town?
 
Do many of your neighbors own your work, or do
 
they carve their own birds and statues?

It's amazing how significant the figure of the
 
cowboy has been to Americans.

the national consciousness the notion of the lone
 
rider as hero.
 He was laconic yet witty,
 
competent to subdue huge beast during working
 
hours and court the ladies in his spare time.
 
Above all he was independent--as they used to
 
say--as a hog on ice.
 [He was immovably on the
 
side of the right (which he always thought was
 
that of the working stiff) as opposed to the wrong
 
(the absentee land owner or the intruding money
 
man).]  And he not only confronted wickedness all
 
by himself, he often wrote poems about it.  This,
 
of course, has been the function of the bard
 
throughout history--to fashion words that burn
 
into memory the needs and wrongs and delights of
 
the plain people.  And it's fascinating to notice
 
how our working cowboys, ranchers, and cattlemen
 
of all ages and persuasions rose--and continue to
 
rise--to that assignment.  Tonight we have with us
 
a Montana rancher who is being honored for his
 
contribution to the poetic repertoire of working
 
cowboys.
 Some years ago he constructed a poem -
 
Reincarnation -
 that has met one of the
 
requirements for immortality in the world of
 
-

traditional art--it is recited by people who do
 
not have any idea who wrote it to begin with.
 But
 
he is just too important and prolific a poet to
 
remain anonymous.
 Please welcome our poet
 
laureate from Montana--WALLACE MCRAE.
 
We conclude our celebration this evening by
 
presenting an enormously talented, witty,
 
multi-gifted, sophisticated man of music--Mr.
 
Howard Armstrong.
 
You know, when we have time and breath to look
 
back over what has been taking place this
 
extraordinary evening,  I believe we will conclude
 
that the main requirement of life in the
 
contemporary world is to develop our capacities
 
for enjoying and relishing many different cultural
 
styles, many different ways of creating meaning
 
and beauty.
 
Like a great number of African-Americans, Howard
 
Armstrong had to learn this early.
 If he was to
 
-
 32 -  
KURALT
 
KURALT
 
make a living playing in the Italian and Polish
 
and Chinese restaurants of the 1920's and 30's, he
 
needed to learn what his customers would most
 
enjoy -
 and what they tended to enjoy most was
 
their own songs in their own languages.
 So Howard
 
Armstrong's repertoire became legendary--from John
 
Henry to I
.
,ady Be Good and all points between.
 
Tonight he might decide to play mandolin or guitar
 
or piano or fiddle--we especially hope he'll play
 
the fiddle--joined by his son, Ralph Armstrong and
 
his special friends Rich and Maureen DeiGrosso on
 
guitar, piano and percussion.
 In a way Howard
 
Armstrong is a precursor of twentieth century
 
mudical sophistication -
 a man who knows and loves
 
it all -
 the legendary HOWARD ARMSTRONG.
 
What a wonderful evening.  What a marvellous bunch
 
of human beings.

Arts.
 Welcome to  the tenth anniversary of
 
the National Heritage Fellowships.
 All  of us
 
at  the Endowment  look forward to  this  event
 
with special pleasure,  not only because  it  is
 
getting  to be known as  one of  the best  shows
 
in town but  also because we deeply believe
 
that  the ongoing  support of  the folk arts  is
 
one of  the most  significant  and meaningful
 
things we do.
 The traditional  folk arts--as
 
you will be discovering  tonight--can stand  as
 
a metaphor  for our nation itself,
 
representing  the many voices  of  the American
 
people,  expressing our complex past,
 
foreshadowing our complex future  and  filling
 
our own time with the joyful  chaos  of
 
peaceably contending cultural  styles  and
 
voices.

of their houses through the back door or the
 
front door and what their last names
 
are--things  like that--you'll begin to
 
realize that you're in the middle of some
 
particular neighborhoods that are where and
 
what they are because of particular reasons
 
that are interesting to know.
 Take
 
Appalachia for instance.
 Everybody has heard
 
of Appalachia and most have an idea about
 
where and what it might be,  but it doesn't
 
show on any map and if you start looking it
 
up in reference books you could conclude it
 
isn't there at all.
 Actually you can
 
describe it geologically -
-
 as an eroded
 
Paleozoic land mass but it's the people who
 
live there who have given it its quality and
 
its character.

The great Cherokee nation came first  and
 
occupied the southern highlands.
 Later
 
European settlement consisted of--might  as
 
well say it--poor folks--Scots,  Irish,  German
 
and English immigrants who had been edged out
 
of the  richer agricultural  land along the
 
U.S.  eastern seaboard.
 African-Americans
 
came too--freed or  runaway slaves,  joined
 
later by Black road builders and tunnel
 
workers--all these people gradually
 
infiltrating what was then still partly
 
wilderness,  a family at a time,  setting up
 
small homesteads,  making their own food,
 
clothing,  medicines,  amusements  in this
 
curiously independent and tolerant region.
 
Three of our Heritage Fellows are from
 
Appalachia--that place that doesn't exist.
 
But  I looked up their home towns on the map,
 
and those towns make a triangle that  is not
 
more than 150 miles  apart on either side--as

 the crow flies,  of course. 
It's  the
 
heartland of Appalachia, there where the
 
three states come together,  and where the
 
music you will hear  is  some of the most
 
nostalgic and memory-laden of the U.S.

Mr.  Melvin Wine from Braxton County,  West
 
Virginia,  has been a farmer  and a miner  and a
 
timber cutter and he's  also a fourth
 
generation fiddler who knows  some of his own
 
great-grand-daddy's  tunes.
 You know when the
 
colonists packed up to come to the new world
 
in the 1700s they brought along their musical
 
instruments too  including the fiddle.
 But to
 
make good use of a fiddle,  you have to have a
 
good fiddler,  and he has  to carry his own
 
tunes  in his own head.
 West Virginia
 
fiddlers have a special  reputation of knowing
 
a barrell of tunes special only to their
 
state,  and Mr.  Wine is known amongst West
 
Virginia fiddlers  for his encyclopedic memory
 
of many of the best of them.
 And then,  as
 
one of his fiddling friends tells us,  he  "has
 
the draw of the West Virginia hills  in his
 
bow."

 Now,  Mr.  Wine,  I have to  say you have  the
 
prettiest names  for your  fiddle  tunes  I

 There is  still  another  spell-binding
 
Appalachian sound:
 the 5-string banjo,  and
 
here to play it for us  is  a gentleman who  at
 
the age of 74  is  still quite unaffected by
 
popular music or popular culture.
 He did not
 
grow up listening to the  radio or  recordings,
 
and when he went to work in the mines he
 
contracted such severe black lung that
 
forever afterward he could not attend  local
 
dances or musical gatherings where there was
 
cigarette smoke in the air.
 He just stayed
 
on home and played his banjo  and  remembered
 
the songs of his  family and repeated them
 
accurately and completely just as he first
 
heard them.
 The result  is  an extraordinary
 
extensive repertory and music of  an
 
astonishing purity.
 Mr.  Sexton,  would you
 
play that  lovely tune called the Beautiful
 
Doll?

 Mr.  Sexton,  that was  just wonderful.
 
You know they say in Kentucky that you know
 
verses nobody ever heard before to songs
 
nobody ever knew existed -
 and that's pretty
 
remarkable in a place like eastern Kentucky
 
where so many of the good songs were born.
 
But,  the words to songs  like yours  are so
 
important that we're going to try an
 
experiment tonight.
 We're going to do what
 
they do at the opera sometimes  and put them
 
on a screen so that  if a song is  in another
 
language or the singer  is using a special
 
dialect,  the audience can still understand
 
the poetry and the outrageous humor of these
 
wonderful  songs.

 Thank you,  Mr.  Sexton.
 And now for a third
 
beautiful sound from this  remarkable musical
 
region.
 These uncrowded and independent
 
mountain communities  in the hills  always
 
sheltered,  as  I've mentioned,  American
 
Indian,  Anglo-American,  Euro-American and
  
African-American families.
 They
 
inter-married sometimes--Mr.  Sexton,  I
 
believe you had a Cherokee grandmother,  did
 
you not?--and they certainly swapped tunes
 
and musical  ideas with each other.
 Mr.  Wine
 
tells me there were several highly respected
 
African-American fiddlers  in his area when he
 
was growing up that he learned some tunes
 
from;  and our next honoree,  Mrs.  Etta Baker,
 
played music with black and white musicians,
 
in her home county of Caldwell,  North
 
Carolina,  when she was just a little girl.
 
Mrs.  Baker's  instrument  is the 6-string
 
guitar,  and her style is distinctive to her

home  region  in the Piedmont  and to her
 
culture.
 Mrs.  Baker plays  rags,  breakdowns,
 
hymns  and early blues  tunes but her  favorites
 
are old melodies  she  learned  from her
 
father.
 Mrs.  Baker,  would you consider
 
perhaps playing one of your  father's  tunes,
 
maybe Railroad Bill?
 Ladies  and
 
gentlemen--the distinguished Piedmont

 You know,  a lot of people argue over what  is
 
"craft"  and what  is  "art"  and I certainly
 
don't  intend to get  into that tonight,  but
 
when people have to make things  that they
 
need,  it's certainly true that most of them
 
will try not only to make their basket or
 
their quilt or their rawhide rope sound and
 
useful,  they'll try to make it beautiful  as
 
well.
 There is something quite wonderful,
 
almost, noble,  about that--and we present  to
 
you now a man from the state of Wyoming who
 
has spent his  life taking stiff dried up old
 
cow hides  and turning them into things of
 
usefulness  and extraordinary beauty.

I understand that people come to Don

King  ropes  and all kinds of working  ranch

Can an ordinary ranch hand afford to shop

 How about buying one of your

Do people actually ride on those
 
exquisitely carved saddles or are they mostly

 I understand that some of them
 
are used for presentation and honorific

I understand that you are credited with
 
developing something called the
 
Sheridan-style saddle,  named after your home
 
town.
 Now I
'd like to  read you a description
 
KURALT

of  that saddle --It  is  a "classic high plains
 
roping saddle;  with short square skirts,  a
 
low cantle with a broad Cheyenne roll,  large
 
swells  and a prominent horn,  small  side
 
jackets  and relatively narrow fenders  at  a 90
 
degree angle to the skirt.. •
 Can you clue
 
us  in on what any of that might mean?
 Say,
 
maybe somebody could bring one of your  sadles
 
out so you could show us -
 
I understand some of these beautiful
 
slides we have been seeing are the work of
 
your students not yourself.
 Can anybody tell
 
but you"
 What does  it take to be a good

Well,  Mr.  King,  it's useful  for us duffers to

The National Heritage awards celebrate,  as we
 
have just seen,  some of the oldest art  forms
 
to thrive on this continent,  many of them -
 
like saddlemaking and ballad singing -
 so old
 
we are continually surprised to find them
 
still  alive and well.
 But these awards  also
 
celebrate new inventions  and recent
 
arrivals.
 While Europeans  and Africans came
 
to this country primarily during the 17th and
 
18th centuries,  immigrants  from Asia did not
 
arrive here in any numbers until  the  19th and
 
20th.
 But,  like all other  immigrants,  they
 
too brought with them art forms of
 
extraordinary antiquity,  sophistication and
 
complexity.
 Listeners who are unaccustomed
 
to the variety of unusual scales  and
 
intonations common to Asian musics,  sometimes
 
feel that  all Asian music sounds  alike,
 
page 21
 
KURALT
 
but as we will discover this evening,  this  is
 
far from true.
 Tonight two eminent
 
musicians,  Mr.  Khamvong Insixiengmai  and Mr.
 
Harry Nakasone,  will bring us two totally
 
different Asian musical styles  and
 
repertoires,  first a village musical
 
tradition from the Southeast Asian nation of
 
Laos,  and then a sampling of the extensive
 
classical music repertoire of the island of
 
Okinawa off the Japanese southern coast.
 
Ladies  and gentlemen,  may I introduce Mr.
 
Khamvong  Insixiengmai  from Fresno California
 
and his  friend and interpreter for this
 
evening,  Mr.  Kingsavanh Pathamrnavong from
 
Chantilly,  Virginia.
 Gentlemen,  the map
 
shows your nation to be long and  land-locked,
 
and I am told it is  in large part composed of
 
farming villages whre the people speak a
 
bewildering number of different  languages  and
 
page 22
 
KURALT
 dialects  -
-
 some say as many as  60.
 Most of
 
the languages  are tonal  -
-
 that  is,  the
 
meaning of a word changes with its pitch hig
 
or  low -
-
 and so Laotian melodies  are fluid
 
and improvisation is very frequent.
 But
 
music is  important in Laos and professional
 
musicians who travel from village to village
 
are extremely
 popular and much beloved in
 
Laos.
 
Mr.  Khamvong  Insixengmai  is one of the very
 
finest such singers,  and since his arrival  in
 
the United States he has been thrilling
 
audiences  from coast to coast with his
 
extraordinary vocal skills.
 Tonight he will
 
improvise in the manner of a professional Lao
 
entertainer embroidering on themes that might
 
be suggested by the host of the occasion.
 He
 
will work with a partner,  Miss Thong-kb
 
Manisone,  and be accompanied on the khene,

courting practice,  hasn't  it?

So  then,  as  I understand  it,  you might  be
 
employed to entertain by improvising  all
 
evening  long on any kind of  subject  suggested
 
page 24
 
KURALT

and the young  lady trying to fend him off,
 
and accompanied all the time by that
 
remarkable musical  instrument,  the khene. 
that  is  the ancient  fore-runner of the pipe
 
organ.
 
We  realize how ridiculous  it must seem to
 
you,  Mr.  Kharnvong,  to come all this way to do
 
such a short performance,  but can you give
 
this  audience just  a taste of what  it would
 
be  like to join with a Laotian audience for
 
an evening's  singing?
 
page 25
 
KHANVONG
 PERFORMANCE
 
KURALT
 Mr.  Khamvong,  We understand that Laotian
 
songs especially on wedding themes are full
 
of jokes and puns,  but since there may have
 
been those in the audience unfortunate enough
 
not to understand Lao,  could you possibly
 
tell us a little bit about what you sang?
 
KHANVONG
 TRANSLATES
 
KURALT
 
Thank you.
 I am sure the audience understood
 
that we could not provide them with
 
translations on our center screen because an
 
improvisational artist such as Mr.  Khamvong
 
doesn't know what he will be saying until the
 
time comes to say it.
 It is a remarkable
 
talent and an astonishing art form;  thank you
 
for sharing even a small part with us.

 While I talk

Now Mrs.  Williams,  do you do the whole
 
quilt all by yourself or do you just make the
 
tops?
 
I understand that after the tops  are made,
 
you have to sandwich the whole quilt together
 
with a backing and filler and the top and sew
 
all that down.
 Do you  like to do that part?

It does  seem to me,  Mrs.  Williams,  that
 
you use the most astonishing colors together
 
in your quilts.
 Lots of Anglo  ladies  in the
 
Midwest and north like to use pastel colors,
 
but you seem to  like to keep your quilts  real
 
lively.
 
I understand that you made up a whole new
 
quilt idea after you heard you were getting
 
the Heritage award.
 Is  it the Britches
 
quilt,  you call  it?
 Why do you call  it that?
 
Do you name your quilts?
 What 's your

engage us for a couple of minutes.]
 
I hope when you get back to Oakland you
 
will tell Mrs.  Wells for us how much we loved

 Halfway across the country from California is
 
still another important neighborhood in the
 
American landscape that isn't printed out on
 
the map.
 It's the Land where the Blues
 
Began--the Mississippi Delta,  that wedge of
 
bottomland,  cradled between the Yazoo and the
 
Mississippi Rivers,  that stretches from
 
Memphis to Vicksburg.
 It's amazing that it
 
isn't really featured in atlases and that its
 
history has never really been truly
 
chronicled.
 Maybe no one has dared to try to
 
fix the Delta story on paper because it has
 
been told and retold in song by generations
 
of African-American bluesmen and women.
 And
 
someday maybe we will stop grooving with
 
their extraordinary music for just a moment
 
to listen to what they 've been telling us
 
about what really happened to black farmers
 
after Reconstruction.

 Welcome back to the tenth anniversary concert
 
of the National Heritage Awards where we have
 
still another shining star to bring you.
 All
 
across the country in the last five or ten
 
years,  there has been a great peaceable
 
uprising of Irish music and Irish musicians.
 
In a recent festival in Milwaukee,  110,000
 
people attended a three-day bash of nothing
 
but Irish music where the fiddles and
 
concertinas never stopped and the dancers
 
kicked the moon right out of the sky.
 One of
 
the men responsible for all this excitement
 
is a quiet fellow whose impeccable
 
musicianship and deep knowledge of the
 
tradition makes him the embodiment of Irish
 
music.
 We have persuaded him to play his
 
flute for you tonight in at least one solo,
 
but it's  impossible to keep all his many
 
friends from coming to join with him and do
 
him honor -
-
 so pretty soon you'll

KURALT
 
hear him jamming  away with his brother
 
Charley Coen on the concertina,  Mick Moloney
 
on guitar,  Willy Kelly on fiddle,  and D.C.'s
 
own Jesse Winch on bodhran  (the Irish drum).
 
And we'll get a bit of dancing by Regan
 
Wick.

 their art.
 Tonight the Folk Arts Program
 
honors three Native artists  representing
 
three different cultural traditions.
 Please
 
welcome:
 MRS.  ROSE FRANK of the Nez Perce of
 
the state of  Idaho; MR.  GEORGE BLAKE of the
 
Hupa/Yurok of northern California and MRS.
 
ESTHER LITTLEFIELD of the Tlingit of Alaska.
 
APPLAUSE
 
KURALT
 All of these three distinguished artists work
 
primarily with their eyes and hands creating
 
things of use and things of beauty.
 Would
 
you all please sit down here with me while we
 
show the audience on the screen a few of the
 
beautiful things you have made.
 
page 38
 
KURALT
 First Mrs.  Rose Frank.
 I understand that
 
you make these beautiful jewel-like patterns
 
out of ordinary cornhusks.
 
Is  it plain old eating corn or some kind
 
of  special corn?
 There is  something called
 
Indian corn,  isn't there?
 
I
' m told that the Nez Perce people were
 
especially skillful at this  art form from a
 
long time back.
 Did they do other crafts too?
 
There seems to be some similarity between
 
what you do with corn husks and things made
 
out of beads and porcupine quills that  I've
 
seen.
 Is that a true similarity or is there
 
some difference I should be seeing?
 
One of the Folk Arts panelists who  is from
 
one of the Sioux tribes said when he  looked
 
page 39
 
KURALT
 
at your work,  "My mother would kill for a
 
piece of Mrs.  Frank's weaving."
 Why do you
 
think people like your work so much?
 
What  is  it that--when you finish a
 
piece--makes you say,  That's  a good one;  I
 
did that one well?
 
What do you try to say to young people
 
these days?--to other people in the Nez Perce
 
tribe?
 
What would you like to say to the whole
 
American people?
 
APPLAUSE
 
page 40
 
KURALT
 
Now,  Mrs.  Esther Littlefield.
 Every one
 
of the many letters  in Folk Arts'  files
 
supporting your nomination talks  about what a
 
dedicated and wonderful teacher you are.
 One
 
letter says that they employed you to teach
 
beadwork but the students came away with far
 
more than that.
 What do you try to do when
 
you teach?
 
It seems that the designs that you follow
 
have perhaps  a different purpose than those
 
Mrs.  Frank uses.
 She prides herself on
 
making things that  look alike on the surface,
 
but are always different.
 You want to make
 
beautiful things that will  identify the
  
people who wear them?
 
What design does your  robe have on it?
 
Your daughter is here too to show us  a robe
 
she made under your direction.
 It's
 
different  isn't  it.

KURALT
 How did the idea of using buttons come
 
about?
 They are so beautiful.
 Do you
 
suppose they reminded early Tlingit  sewers of
 
things  like shark teeth or shells?
 
Mrs.  Littlefield,  the Tlingit culture is
 
extremely old and its people are extremely
 
wise.
 Do you have something you would like
 
to say to the American people about why
 
people should work to preserve their culture?
 
APPLAUSE

KURALT
 And now -
-
 Mr.  George Blake
 
Mr.  Blake,  I understand that you are a
 
trained and credentialed commercial  artist
 
with degrees  and things  like that.
 Why have
 
you troubled yourself to  learn the
 
traditional crafts of your own people?
 
What did you have to do to  learn them?
 
Which of  the old-timers  taught you the
 
most?
 
What did you learn from him besides how to
 
make whatever it was he showed you?
 
What would you,  today,  from this  spot,
 
like to say to the American people?
 
page 43
 
KURALT
 
Thank you.
 May we never  again  look at
 
history as dull  or  art  as  trivial.
 Thank
 
you

Littlefield,  and Mr.  George Blake.

KURALT
 About this time in the evening,  I always get
 
kind of overwhelmed -
-
 there's just so much
  
to bring you -
-
 such a vision of an almost
 
secret diversity you should understand is
 
still out there alive and happy.
 The city of
 
Tarpon Springs has scarcely made its ethnic
 
association a secret;  the town itself grew up
 
because of the excellent fishing in its
 
waters' and long ago,  sponge fishermen from
 
the Greek islands came in to take advantage
 
of the warm temperatures and quiet reefs
 
where sponges grow.
 Among them was Mr.
 
Nikitas Tsimouris of the Grecian island of
 
Kalymnos.
 He plays an ancient music,  rarely
 
heard now even on the island of his birth,
 
and he plays it on the proper instrument,  the
 
tsabouna, a kind of Greek bagpipe.
 It is an
 
elemental instrument -
-
 basically the skin of
 
a goat inverted and filled with air -
-
 and
 
the dancing is possibly elemental too -
-
 a
 
page 45
 
KURALT
 
line dance with everybody doing the same step
 
only a bit differently,  person to person
 
first a group of men,  then a group of women.
 
Tonight we have Mr.  Tsimouris'  wife,  sister
 
and daughter to dance for us  in the same way
 
they would back home in Tarpon Springs at any
 
Greek community picnic or festivity.
 This  is
 
the kind of music and dance that you might
 
have found hundreds of years  ago on any of
 
the Dodecanese Islands -
 sturdy,  unstoppable,
 
full of subtle variations,  the dancers moving
 
across , the land like an advancing wall
 
Please welcome,  Mr.  Nikitas Tsimouris,  the
 
stellar Greek bard of Tarpon Springs,  Florida.

KURALT
 Thank you.
 The nearness of the
 
quincentennary reminds us of the initial
 
explorations of the Americas.
 Early voyagers
 
and settlers came from many nations,  many
 
from Spain,  many long before the English
 
founded their settlements to the north.
 
Today Spanish language cultural traditions
 
span the country coast-to-coast in enormous
 
variation.
 This should not astonish anybody;
 
this entire evening has been a demonstration
 
of just how great small differences can be.
 
Besides,  our Spanish speaking citizens came
 
here at very different times from very
 
different places.
 One of our honorees
 
tonight comes from a people sent as colonists
 
by the Spanish government from the Canary
 
Islands,  and they
 set foot on the swampy
 
coast of Louisiana at about the same time the
 
English-speaking colonists to the north were
 
page 47
 
KURALT
 fighting for their  independence.
 The
 
ancestors of our second honoree came here
 
even earlier,  once claiming the entire
 
southwest as their own domain.
 Ladies and
 
gentlemen,  please welcome -
-
 Mr.  Irvan Perez
 
of Lousiana,  and Mr.  Lalo Guerrero from
 
California.
 
PEREZ AND GUERERRO COME IN,  TAKE BOWS,

KURALT
 Mr.  Perez,  welcome..
 CONVERSATION ABOUT DUCKS
 
Your people have an ancient and proud
 
tradition and I believe that you have led in
 
trying to keep it alive.
 (Perez comments?)
 
I  believe some of your songs are
 
extraordinarily old,  dating back as far as
 
the Crusades.
 Could you sing us perhaps the
 
ballad of Don Fernando el Frances?
 We're
 
page 48
 
KURALT
 putting the words up on the screen so that
 
the audience cay try to follow,  but it's
 
still a pretty confusing story.
 Basically it
 
seems to be about a man who goes off to the
 
Crusades and comes home to find his wife
 
dallying with another man,  and he kills them
 
both.
 Lots of operas have been written about
 
just such themes...
 
PEREZ
 Makes his own introduction and sings DON
 
FERNANDO EL FRANCES and then introduces his
 
own composition.
 (If he doesn't mention it
 
KURALT should bring in the fact that he
 
composed this  (Somos Americans)  in the
 
classic decirna tradition,  a ten line poetic
 
form of extreme antiquity.)

KURALT
 
Thank you,  Senor Perez.
 And now for our
 
final presentation,  another great singer and
 
composer of songs,  probably the most widely
 
loved song writer of the Spanish-speaking
 
Southwest.
 One of the secrets of Sr.  Lab
 
Guerrero's songwriting talent is his ability
 
to resonate deeply  with the nature of his
 
own Mexican and Mexican-American people in
 
songs that speak of their dreams,  their joys,
 
and their tragedies.
 His compositions range
 
from corridos that,  like "Fernando el
 
Frances"  sung by Sr.  Perez,  tell tragic
 
stories;  to hilarious parodies of Mexican
 
stereotypes such as his song  "Tacos for Two;"
 
to enormously popular canciones
  
rancheras__Mexican_style country songs.
 
Tonight,  Sr.  Guerrero will first sing one of
 
his corridos,  accompanying himself on the
 
guitar in classic corrido-singing fashion.
