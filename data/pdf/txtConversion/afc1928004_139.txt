HOW little do the great ones care, who are at home secure, 
What hidden dangers colliers dare, what hardships they 
endure; 
The bright tires their mansions boast, to cheer themselves 
and wives, 
Mayhap were kindled at the cost of jovial colliers' lives.

Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much of every joy ye 
can, 
But let your mirth be always such as best becomes a

For what would New York be without the lads that look

"Why 
1)iiilleit You Say No fit efore ":" 
Sung by TONY PASTOR, with tremendous applause. 
Ix this go-ahead age new by-word ' s 
the rage. 
New ones come up day after day. 
Devoid of all sense, and it's something immense 
O'er the people to have such a 
sway. 
How often we meet little boys on the street, 
Who all such slang phrases adore; 
They get the last out, and now this is their shout : 
Why didn't you say so before? 
CHORUS. 
Why didn't, why didn't, why didn't you say so before? 
1 
once asked a 
friend me five dollars to lend, 
I 
thought that he couldn't do less, 
lie just rubbed his chin, and at once (lid begin 
Himself in these words to express— 
To do it. my lad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact I'd have let you have more 
if you'd called yesterday, now it's all paid away, 
Why didn't you say so before? 
CHORUS.— Why didn't, etc. 
Once most driven mad. with the tooth ache so bad. 
I 
into a 
dentist did pop. 
The molar he eyed, then his tongs he applied. 
And pulled me 
six times round I 
he shop; 
Says l.wlun he'd done, you've pulled out t 
he wrong one, 
While I 
did with agony roar: 
It's done now, says he, the fault don't rest with me, 
Why didn't you say so before? 
Owl:vs.—Why didn't, etc. 
"DOWN IN A 
COAL MINE" SONGSTER. 
One night after (lark, coming home from a 
lark, 
From up the best end of the town, 
A man, with a 
shout, from an alley rushed out, 
And with a 
big stick knocked inc down; 
My hat he did smash, then demanded my cash, 
Says I, but five cents is my store, 
Says he, you're a 
flat, how was I 
to know that ? 
Why didn't you say so before? 
Cnonrs.—Why didn't, etc. 
My wife, Vother day, appeared quite in a 
way 
13eeituSe our first born was a 
boy; 
All day she would cry, sit wiping her eye, 
Instead of expressing her joy; 
Says she to me, Joe, I 
hate boys, as you know, 
Id rather of girls have a 
score. 
Says I, with a 
leer, don't grumble, my dear, 
Why didn't you say so before?

_Brigham Young. 
-I.ung to crowded houses by TONY PASTOR. 
Now Brigham Young was a 
Mormon bold, 
Awl leader of the roaring rams, 
And shepherd of a 
nice little flock of sheep, 
And a 
fold of prett v 
little lambs. 
Ile lived with his five-and-forty wives, 
In the city of the great Salt Lake, 
Where they woo and they coo like little doves do, 
And cackle like ducks to a 
drake. 
ettoRCS. 
Oh. Bri, -, ham, Brigham Young, it's a 
miracle how he sur-
vives, 
With his roaring rams, and his pretty little lambs, 
And his five-and- forty wives. 
Now thigharn Young was a 
stout man once, 
But now he's thin and old; 
Ana strange to relate, he's bald upon his pate, 
That once had a 
covering of gold; 
For his oldest wives won't have white hair, 
His young ones won't have red, 
So with pulling of it out. taking turn and turn about, 
Tinry've pulled all the wool off his head. 
Cnoncs.—Oh, Brigham, etc. 
His oldest wives won't sing- loud songs, 
his young ones won't sing psahns; 
So between such a 
crowd he has it pretty loud— 
They're

Cid:it:se gongs.

TONY PASTOR' s 
A. Night Around Town. 
A 
descriptive medley song, written for Tony Pastor by J. F. Poole, 
Sung by TONY PASTOR.—A M, " 
Joe Bowers." 
CONE listen to my dit ty, I 
shan't detain you long, 
Of a 
night in New York City, I'll tell you in my 
song. 
ill try my best to please you, and do the thing up 
brown, 
There's carious sights, I 
tell you, to be seen in this cre 
town. 
(AIR—" Abram's Daughter.") 
Some time ago in love I 
fell, 
(And don't you think Pd orter?) 
With a 
charming girl, and quite the belle, 
A codfish merchant's daughter. 
Her daddy's hope, she's got the soap, 
Yes, lots of the spondulieks, oh, oh, oh. 
And soon, you see, we'll married be, 
And don't you think we'd otter? 
Because she likes me, and I 
likes she, 
This codfish merchant's daughter. 
SPOKEN.—The other evening we went out: for a 
sl roll, we 
dropped into Wallaek's to see the Florenees. Saw Billy 
playing Paddy O'Rafferty. 
Something in this style: 
(Imitate Florence.) 
" 
Be me sowl, they tied me up, head an' heels, an' threw 
me down in the hould o' the ship, an' there they left me, in 
lavendher, like Paddy Ward's pig. 
At last a 
fellow up 
stairs, on the deck, sings out : 
Land!" Where is it ?' sft . 
I. ' There,' says he." Where?' says I. 
Don't you see it?' 
says he. ' No.' says T. 
Look over the eat- head,' says he. 
Well, I 
looked about. but had luck to the cat's head or 
cat's tail I 
could see. 
D'ye mind ?" 
Then Mrs. Florence sang •` My Johnny was a 
Shoemaker," 
in this manner: 
(Sing a 
verse in imitation of Mrs. Florence.) 
Then we took a 
walk over to the Cremona , Gardens. 
Sat dawn awhile. There were a 
couple of FIt iii Avente 
tilers near us. 
One of them spoke, something in this 
fashion: 
(Imitates the drawling tone of a 
fop.) 
" 
Ah! Wobert, deuced fine place this; decidedly seleet 
and demned awistocratic; great plaee for the gals, ( 1:z-tint-
ing eweatures. 
See that denmed delight ful piece of en lie°

11 
Aud, aW, waltaw, half a sawdine and a boy to wax my 
;jaws, 
Then we heard Patti sivg, that divine aria from the 
opera of 
This is the style: 
(Imitation of Patti. 
Burlesque operatic.) 
Aftc,r which I saw my charmer home, and sauntered 
down Broadway. Dropped into Bryant's just in time to 
hear Dan in his stump speech. Dan Bryant in " Dat's Vot's 
de Matter." 
(imitates Dan Bryant.) 
" 
Secondly in de twenty lust place, my 
sweet geraniums, 
who wfs de fust man that invented de nigger? Was it 
Senitor Sumner or was it General Fremont ? or was it 
Greely? Dat's de question. When Gineral Bailer 
landed at New Orleans, what was de fast thing he asked? 
Which WU de leading journal here when you want to shave 
—Confittlerate bonds or Gayetty's medicated?" 
Then I 
called in at another place. I 
guess some of you've 
been there, 444. 
Heard Tony Pastor sing a 
song. They- say 
he can sing, but I 
don't believe it. 
This is his style: 
(Ant, " In the Merry Month of May.") 
The nation's cry is now to arm, 
And at the call the people come; 
They leave behind their shops and farms, 
And join the ranks to follow the drum; 
And all rush on, our army swelling, 
To dc-, or die with brave McClellan. 
A million of men, if he should need ' em, 
Are willing to strike for right and freedom. 
The nation's cry, etc. 
SPONF.N.—I 
started for home. The streets were quiet, 
wit It the exception of the organ-grinders; they never go 
to bed. 
The first corner I 
came to there was one grinding 
" 
Annie of the Vale," and at the next another was playing 
away at " Sweet Kitty Clyde." I 
passed a 
party of musical 
young gents, who, la the words of Shakespeare, 
"4 Wear their lungs out shouting through the town, 
And make the night hideous screeching—Old John 
Brown." 
A slight idea of the " midnight serenaders." 
_(Sings in imitation of an intoxicated party.—AIR, " Annie 
of the Vale.") 
The night stars are glowing, the moon it's a 
flowing, 
(Hie) The radiance fills the ( hie) summer-er air. 
(Music changes imperceptibly to " John Brown,") 
'While John Brown's knapsack is a-mouldering in the 
grave,

TONY P.VTOR'S

it, 
dov,nmine. At it we wont as well as the rest. 
i 
never 
danced so hard in my life. 
She seemed to fly throw:h the

Al last I 
sank exhausted. The last 1

had striwk the chandelier with her toes, and bounded 
1):tek like an India rubber ball; as for me, I 
started to look 
1.017 the bar, to recover my senses at

All these affairs have caused me so much anxiety,

I've also had the toothache, eon's, warts, and. bunions, 
Searletina, concertina, tightness of the chest, 
Pains hi the knees, oh! such a

My sufferings from the measles, too, can scarcely be ex-

Then I've had the colic spasms, dizziness and swinunings, 
A ople-pletie, pa ir-oleptic fits, believe me it is true, 
Mtilly-grubs, and collv-wobbles. with delicious trimmings,

The Gal That Signs Herelt"" Ian." 
Sung by TONY PASTOR.—A IR, " Rosin the Bow." 
H AVE you seen the philosopher's darling, 
Who thinks Eddy Booth so divine, 
And that poor Annie Dickinson's taper 
Is shockingly dun in its shine; 
Who rustles in silks she has paid for. 
And holds up Sir -Horace to view, 
Twirling round in the Itedowa polka— 
The gal that signs herself Lu ? 
This damsel so tenderly nurtures 
The best moral, plant ever grew, 
She's skill'd married folks to umnarry, 
And rivet their fetters anew. 
But lest she should fly to the zenith, 
When the Tribune cries hastily " shoo!" 
There's a 
string always tied to the ankle 
Of the gal that signs herself Lu. 
Pretty women, whose husbands are shiftless, 
She advises to sidle away, 
Provided kind gentlemen willing 
To see them safe home from the play. 
When Beecher her mandate peruses, 
He carries his mummeries through, 
His will and his judgment he loses 
For the gal that signs herself Lit. 
Oh, had I 
the knack of composing 
Such letters as flow from her brain, 
What a 
treasure I'd be to old Bennett; 
I'd never be seedy again. 
But since it is folly to wish it— 
Free lovers, I 
know what to do— 
If she's ready—hey! " onward to Riehmond " 
With the gal that signs herself -Lu.

The other evening out I

My leasure time beguiling:, 
When into a

And found 1

" 
Come, Tony, lin us. have a

Cried one wild d

Says .1, " You'll just excuse me now,

They held me last. 
I 
had to drink 
'Till my spirits g-rew elator, 
And very soon 1 
stoggered out, 
With 
Good-liye— 1'it see you later." 
A pretty girl I 
met, her eyes 
A glance of love shot through me, 
And soon for supper we -were bound, 
I 
thought, of course, she knew me. 
She drank so much, it really- seemed 
'Twould soon intoxicate her .; 
Thinks I 
she'll break my pocket-book 
Before it gets much later. 
To my dismay I 
caught her soon 
A- winking at the waitor. 
Saying, " Here's a 
flat !" Says T, " Enough, 
Good-bye-1
-11 see you later.'' 
They called on me to pay the bill, 
'Which I'd no inclination. 
A policeman, t 
hen. -they soon brought in 
To take me to the station : 
He called me, saying, " Come along, 
My swindling operator. 
And soon I'll have you in a 
cell, 
Then, good-live-1AI see you later. -
But I 
tripped him up, awl off I 
went 
swill as any skater, 
And to the peeler hollered out. 
" 
Good-bye- 111 i•ce you later." 
I 
wandered home, and thete my wife 
Commenced a

me in this manner:

You have come down at last, but allow me to state 
That the boarders all have long gone away, 
And the hash it is played out, ' cause for breakfast you are

And this is my mother's washing day, 
Buckwheat cakes all gone too, 
There is nothing left for you. 
You know that the hour is growing late,

However, I 
pat on

But she's now played out, like a

Vos Lisa, de, Dutchman's daughter. 
SrokEN—I 
gave her my last fifty- eclat stamp,

generously asked no (' hang . I 
walk( d

the street, and the first person that struck my view was a 
ear comluetor, on a 
strike, 
lie gave vent to his feelings 
thusly: 
(Ant—" Pulling Hard Against the Stream.") 
Here you see a 
car condtwtor, 
Tolling fourteen hours a

Never once, as all acknowledge, 
" 
Knocking down" to make it pay. 
Capital makes war on labor, 
hart as hard as any Turk, 
Why refuse a

For an honest. fair day's work? 
So let the workers help each other, 
Sam and Sandy, Hans and Mike, 
And we'll never see another 
Car conductor's strike. 
SPOKEN.—A little further on I 
met a

SPONEN.—Leaving the aspirant for political honors, I 
came upon a group of boys— that -useful and interesting 
class called bootblacks. Young America, one of them, was 
amuing the rest with a 
iong, of which I 
only heard one 
verse— this: 
(AIR—" Tickled Thom in the Right Place.") 
Although I'm a 
bootblack I 
never repine, 
But always content with my 
lot, 
Just put up your boots and I'l give ' ern a 
shine, 
A 
shine that you'll say is " red hot." 
The brokers from Wall street I 
often pass by, 
And I 
looks them right up in the face, 
For I 
know that gold panics can ne'er trouble me, 
And they often get in a 
tight place.

A Rich Daddy. 
Sung by Tosv PAsTon, 
I 
COURTED 011oe a 
lovely miss, 
With Cupid's fair connival; 
.13ut when I 
said. " Let its marry, sis," 
found I 
had a 
rival. 
Now, I 
was honest, young, and strong, 
Though my father was a 
Paddy • 
But my rival's only merit was 
He had a 
wealthy daddy. 
I 
offered her as true a 
heart 
As beats imm any body. 
But a 
mechanic had no show 
Affainst the son of shoddy. 
So, soon she 'wed the sickly sprout, 
And gloried in her laddie, 
Soon, in tine clothes, paraded out 
On the greenbacks of his daddy. 
My hook I 
hustled in the sea 
And caught-an humble maid, 
And ill her hottest, faithful love 
My struggles were repaid. 
Mv former love with sneering laugh 
bid often pass me by— 
Mv wife with sweet content just said, 
••/,'or low, 
how is that for high?' " 
Thus time wont swiftly bounding on; 
A boss I 
soon became 
My little wife a 
lady grow 
In look and wealth and name. 
Thus when I 
built a 
stone-Erma house, 
And hired a hungry laddie, 
I 
soon found out miiv hodman was 
The son of the rich daddy. 
"Come, Paddy, quick, bring up the brick 
And mortar in your ' toddy:" 
And this is what became of her 
Who wed the son of shoddy. 
And rt,ow, fair maids, a 
moral learn, 
Remember this, my- rhyme: 
There iS no path so rugged that 
Au honest love can't climb.

Twinkle and gleam like stars—

A- leaning o'er the bars. 
He has lifted his ragged hat 'brim,

Oh, where is my sun-bonnet, mother? 
He was thinking of me, all day. 
And Fin going down lo the memlow, 
['or I 
know he is waiting there, 
To wreathe the sunshiny blossoms 
in the curls of my yellow hair. 
And I

While he turns the oxen away.

had such a 
beautiful (name— 
With the noise of a 
dam when it's roarin ' 
To me, Phelim O'Dowd it was, came. 
In his hand thin he held a 
big platter, 
In the other ft 3,Tard of 0. spune; 
Says 1, " Oh! good lord, Si hat's I 
he matter?" 
For he looked like the man in the »10011. 
Ifis hair stood on end like bristles, 
His eyes looked like comets afire, 
his voice, like a 
million of whist lus. 
With anguish did make me pet spire. 
"Now Phelim," says I, " don't fool tight, 
You look like a 
horse that is bate." 
Says he, ' Me darlin' onld Hoolag tin 
I'm thirstin' for som ethin' to ate." 
'Ah ! Phelim, me bye, thisis ° win' 
To what you have writ about hash; 
Shure 1 
knew when I 
heard you were crewin' 
One day you would go all to smash." 
"l 
issus Hoolgan." says he, '• be kindly, 
Like the boarding-house dame that we knew, 
Shure ye know I 
can't, ate yer hash blindly 
So just plase me and call it a 
stew.' 
Then I 
filled up his platter a 
heapin,' 
'Twas emptied as fast as I 
filled, 
You can swear that he kept me a 
leapin' 
Till 1 
thought that myself would be killed. 
" 
Good Phelim,"„ says I. quite affrighted, 
And in tones 1 
hat would chat in a young toad, 
"It's meself, boy, that would be del ighte-• 
If you'd move to another abode." 
Says he, " I'll not lave this stool agin, 
Till me hunger is fully a pposed, 
And I'll tell you now, Missis o'Iloolagan, 
You better stop lookin' amazed." 
Then says I, while tears were a-failin, 
" 
I've tried yer big stout mil to fill, 
I 
might as well try what's appal lin -, 
To fill the lake over the hill." 
Thin I 
took in ute hands the big ladle, 
And shoveled the hash in his maw, 
Till the little one cried in the cradle, 
In affright at the size of his jaw. 
But he swallowed it all like a 
jaguar, 
Till at last but the serapin' he got; 
"

And then like a 
half- famished. linger, 
Be jabhers, he swallowed the pot. 
With that Mister Iloolagan awoke me, 
With kickin' and roaring with pain, 
" 
Limerick Belle, you will choke me, 
lf you try those mild tricks but agin." 
Bedad, with lite hair froin the matt rass, 
I'd crammed hint as rain does a

You can bet then I
