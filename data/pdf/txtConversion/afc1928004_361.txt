OH, many years ago, away down in dixey, 
That's when I 
was a 
poor old slave, 
I 
told you that I 
had a 
heap of pleasure, 
Now everything am silent as the grave, 
All the boy's that belong to good old massa 
Am 
scatter 'round the country in a 
heap, 
I'm lost, I'm bewildered, I'm dumfounded, 
Oh, what will become of Uncle Pete. 
I'm lost, I'm bewildered, I'm dumfounded, 
Oh, what will become of Uncle Pete. 
CHORUS. 
Poor Uncle Pete come along, 
Poor Uncle Pete come along, 
Children now am calling, 
Poor Uncle Pete come along, 
Poor Uncle Pete come along, 
Yes I 
am coming, 
Yes he is coming. 
No more will I 
see my good old niksy, 
Dey laid her slowly in de clay, 
She sickened and she withered like a 
flower. 
Yes, from dis weary world she's passed away 
So I 
roam round here ' along you strangers, 
And try hard to shuffle wid my feet. 
Pm crippled, I'm aged, I'm rhnmatic, 
What will become of Uncle Pete. 
Pm crippled, I'm aged, I'm rheumatic, 
What will become of Uncle Pete. 
Poor Uncle Pete. Sc.c. 
Sense me white folks for dis feeling, 
That flows spontaneous from de heart,

spect I'll soon cross o'er de river Jordan, 
Whar we'll meet again no more no more to 
But while I 
stay down here among you 
I'll try and please you white folks all a

Copyrighted 1816. lay A. 
J. 
FISHER, OS Nassau St., New York. 
I'm the father of a 
bouncing girl, 
With cheeks like cherries red; 
She's a 
credit to the neighborhood, 
I'm only twelve months wed. 
When I 
come home from labor 
After toiling all the day, 
Me wife puts Nelly in Inc arms, 
And this to to me did say— 
CHORUS, 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Arrah can't you mind the child! 
Tie it up in an over- coat, 
She's surely going wild. 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Mind the Child awhile! 
She'll kick and bite, 
And cry all night, 
Arrah Patrick mind the child. 
There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to, 
Was give to the child when she had fits, 
But nothing would bring her to •, 
She'd put mustard plasters on her feet, 
And give her a 
bowl of tea, 
And then she'd lay her in my arms, 
And this to me would say— 
Anali Patrick mind the baby, 
Ah when Nelly grew up to a 
lady, 
I 
had no control at tall; 
She'd say I 
am no baby, 
As she waltz away to a 
ball.

TUE STARS OF THE PERIODi 
Dedicated to Harrigan and Hart 
By EDWARD AUSTIN. 
Hasten for seats, do not delay, 
Great artists are in town to-day ; 
And high upon the roll of fame, 
Resplendent shines their well-known name! 
Refinement's air pervades their acts, 
And what they do no neatness lacks; 
Reputation great they've earned and made, 
No one throws them in the shade! 
In their great act, " Slavery Days," 
Beetling applause they're sure to raise. 
Go and see the " Blue and Gray," 
Clasping hands in bright array; 
And " The Sixty Ninth" (the " gallant,") 
Observe the boys possess men's talent. 
Nature, Harrigan has surely blest, 
Made him " different from the rest," 
And by his own majestic sway, 
Banish, he will, all care away. 
Next comes Tony, who sings so well, 
In dancing, none can him excel; 
Devoid of all that's stale or low, 
No rival does this artist know. 
Homage should to both be paid: 
Astonishing is " The Day Parade ;" 
And other sketches they will do 
That are to life and nature true. 
Remember, the music of excellent worth 
In the mind of Braham had its birth; 
Then the manager of this great team— 
Obliging Hanley—deserves esteem ! 
ATISFACTION, great, is given to all— 
Now don't forget this night to call.

Written by ED. HARRIGAN. 
As sung by HARRIGAN ez 
HART, throughout the country. 
Did you ever hear tell of the Brady's ? 
Gentlemen, born of fine ladies! 
Gallant and gay, from Old Grannaway. 
Big Boys, Big Girls, and Big Baby's! 
Not one of them are aristocratic ; 
All solid and bold Democratic— 
That live in a 
Palace or Attic— 
The Historical family of Brady's.

The neighbors all talk, 
When they are out for a 
walk, 
What a 
fine Gentleman and his Lady! 
They bow and nod, 
At every rod, 
To Johany and Cornelius O'Brady. 
For Scholars, the Brady's were famous— 
For beauty, the equal of Venus. 
Neatness and grace, with Circassian face; 
Small face, big brains, big genius— 
All of them self-influential— 
The devil-a-bit confidential— 
Like QRser, most eluquention!

Old Adam was a

Copyrighted 1S76, by A. 
J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau St.. New York. 
Old country people say. 
Where there's will there is a 
way, 
So I've kept it in my memory all the while; 
Throwing care unto the dpge, 
Oh I" bundled up my togs, 
And sailed away from Erin's lovely isle; 
To America in the west, 
Of nations she's the best. 
Then take advice my countrymen. 
And listen to my plan: 
Save your money, buy a 
passage, 
Cross the western ocean; 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
risini- man; 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising Juan; 
Oh the land is mighty broad. 
With the divil a 
duke or lord 
To make you bend your knee to his rule; 
Where your children have a 
chance 
In learning to advance, 
Free education there in any school; 
Poor old Ireland, oh-oh- hone, 
I 
have heard your people motin.1 
They have suffered sad privation 
Ever since the world began; 
Throw of the yoke of tyranny, 
Come over to uncle Samuel, 
Settle in Columbia, 
And be a 
rising man. 
Settle in Columbia 
And be a 
rising man. 
Oh the day ic drawing near, 
When a 
signal you shall hear 
Which will send a 
thrill of gladness o'er the sea; 
As a 
million Irish hearts, 
From kmerica departs, 
'Twill make the lion `,reinble in his knee; 
With monev and with brains 
To handle all the reins. 
Ready for to fight it out, 
Or settle it with the pen. 
So take advice my countrymen, 
And cross the western ocean, 
Be an American citizen 
And join the rising men. 
Be an American citizen, 
And join the rising mon.

Cornelius Duffy, the people's choice, 
A

The enemy we will hunt, 
We'll rule New York, ah that's the talk, 
When Duffy's to the front. 
You can drink your lager on Sunday then, 
And speak your mind at will, 
You can fight all night, till broad day-light, 
The police can't keep you still; 
Your influence will be powerful, 
Led by a 
man of ability, 
When Cornelius Duffy's to the front? 
Far up in Albany.

Way back to Italy, 
And live upon red herrings, bones,

DANCING IN THE BALLET. 
Written and sung by ED. HARRIGAN. 
I 
was once the queen of the ballet so gay, 
The greatest artist ever seen on the stage; 
In the art Terpsichore, a 
sweet beauty in fact, 
I 
set the whole town in a 
rage. 
Engaged by Jarrett and Palmer each week, 
To do the solos in the Crook; 
I 
would fascinate your dears,. 
With my loving, languishing look. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing in the ballet, 
The beautiful Parisian ballet, 
I 
was the queen, La belle Pauline, 
Dancing in the ballet. 
4' 
My name on the bills was Silvina Malki, 
My real name was Johannah McGee; 
So fluent I 
speak the French language, oh my, 
That's warbled in Tip-per- rat 
The young men would call me a 
dazzler so sweet,. 
Delightful, entrancing they'd say, 
Now I'm forced to make shirts for the supers I 
meet., 
Considered by all en passe. 
Dancing in the ballet, &c. 
was so bewitchingly, graceful and neat, 
In slow movements 4rny .overs, .ts there I 
excello. 
Mountains of bouquets and flowers so sweet, 
Was thrown to this pretty gazelle. 
The young girls would say, what a 
beauty and sigh, 
As around on my toes I 
would spin; 
Itk the back line of ballet, I'll stop till I 
die, 
Because I'm so dreadfully thin. 
Dancing in the ballet, & c. 
When standing amidst the coryphees there, 
I 
make such a 
sweet-looking fairy-like queen. 
Could stand on the end of a 
needle, 
And turn or float in cloud in the air. 
My dresses were made and brought out from Paris, 
Most gorgeously trimmed round with gold; 
Now I'm in the back line of the ballet, 
simply because I 
am old. 
Dancing in the ballet.

Price 40 cents. 
As Sung by the FOY SISTERS. 
Ah, ha! we're off so gaily, 
Now let others take the rear, 
We're coming solid to the front, 
Of that don't have a 
fear ; 
The Alulligan's, the Hoolihan's, 
The Dougherty's and all; 
When we're paradin' thro' the stets, 
We drive them to the wall. 
Cuosus. 
First the left and then the right, 
But never both together; 
The tall, the short, the thick, the thin, 
We're worse, begob, than leather; 
As we're paradin' thro' the streets, 
I 
tell you we're the cards, 
We're bound to be the Hummers, 
We're the Donegan Light Guard! 
So now we are the darlings, 
On that you may bet high, 
We have a 
prize for every man, 
And forty more besides. 
We don't mix with the common ones, 
For ourselves we have regard, 
We are " A 
One" above the crowd, 
We're the Donegan Light Guard! 
First the left, &c. 
Then you should come and see us 
As we march down Broadway; 
They are a 
gallant lot of men, 
I'm sure we'll hear you say. 
The " Seventh" come,and gaze at us, 
And then they beat retreat; 
It's no use, boys, they give it up, 
They lmow we can't be beat! 
First the left, &a.

WE are the famous Fusileers you've heard so much about; 
We make the street resound with cheers, whenever we tum 
out! 
Our uniform is neat and gay, the finest in the land; 
We muster in the Fourteenth Ward, on Bow'ry Street, near 
Grand; 
Our Captain's name is Doherty, a 
finer lad you never se ,
_‘; 
Sure he's always gay and free, and he no danger fears! 
See him marching thro' the street, watch the motion of his feet 
No crowd that walks can ever beat the Doherty Fusileers! 
CHORUS. 
Eyes front! toe the line! mind the step, and keep in time! 
Now the band begins to play, the air is full of cheers! 
Right wheel! mind your eye I " Pipe" the girls upon the sly; 
Aint they grand" the people cry, the Doherty Fusileers! 
It's special duty we perform, and each invited guest 
We fill with Casey's syhiskey, sure, that same is of the best! 
The Duke Alexis we received, from far across the " sa." 
, 
And Ka'ico, from the Sandwich Isles, we sported on Broadway 
Then the royal Japanese Flag's a 
waving in the breeze, 
Erin's Harp, the Stars ane Stripes, that flag we love so dear! 
Then together, " cheek by jowl" it was grand, upon my soul 
Sure, half the glory can't be told, of the Doherty Fusileers! 
CHORUS. — Eyes front, &c. 
Upon the seventeenth of March you'll see us, ev'ry year; 
For that's the day of all, my boys, to Irishmen so dear; 
St.Patrick's praises, then, are sung around on ev'ry hand; 
And we fall in line, and gayly time the music of the band: 
"Gurryowen," sweet and gay, " Awkward Squad," and 
"Patrick's day," 
Now the band begins to play, the air is full of cheers! 
Pretty girls upon us gaze,—say we have such martial ways;

In the " Patrick's-day Parade ;" 
The " Skidraores," too, were also there— 
A fine display they made.

As they " Down Broadway" did go. 
There were no finer men in all 
The " Regular Army, Oh."

Opera airs from Avenue A ; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing 
So they marched away. 
" 
The Ould Hat," blocked for fifty cents, 
Again gleamed 'mid the throng, 
And " McNamara," proud's a 
lord, 
Beneath it marched along; 
He heeded not the naughty boys; 
But, from a 
well-filled can, 
Drank frequent healths to Ireland, with 
" 
Muldoon, the Solid Man."

Humorous Recitation by ED. ilminrome. 
CHEESE pards, 
give it out straight, 
How I 
dropped down to a 
bum, 
Don't lay it altogether, rocks, 
On whisky, gin and rum. 
Put some of it to good nature, 
I 
was allus ripe and meller, 
I 
loved company, ' deed I 
did, 
They said I 
was a 
good feller, 
Have a 
ball, no mixey pards, 
I 
his't no more this year, 
Go in and get your load, 
But don't say I 
gave you a 
steer. 
I'm agin ' em shure, bet on me, 
On the avenue or in a 
cellar, 
I've drank enough to swim a 
ship, 
That's when I 
vtas a 
good fellow. 
You're young, fresh, full of chin, 
You've got to keep up your lick, 
There's a 
way to get out of it soon, 
There aint much need of a 
kick 
Stay home and study figures, 
It's an old thing for me to bellow, 
Studying Hoyle was solid for me, 
That's wnen I 
was a 
good fellow. 
Mother's sick, ab, that's tough. 
You say you're her only kid, 
Don't use the old woman rough, 
Might get a 
stepmother instead. 
If you aint flowing I'm lying. 
You start like a 
steam propeller, 
Boy, you'll do a 
heap of that crying, 
If you stick to being a 
good fellow, 
I've a 
few scads, aint on the borrow, 
I 
was broke, I 
struck the gang, 
They give me the old I'm sorry, 
That's charity done up in slang, 
They said that I 
was a 
good un, 
When a 
muss sprung up I'd quell her, 
My head been as big as a 
pudden. 
It come from being a 
good fellow. 
That's all the advice I'm giving, 
You take it, I 
don't want a 
sou, 
Save money, you'll get a 
living, 
Yimus'nt mind what they say 'bout you, 
What, me? I'll get long, don't worry, 
I'm bran new like a

They shout huzza, from near and far, 
At our Irish boys so true ; 
With columns solid as a

Bright uniforms neat and clean, 
We are, one and all, sons of Erin, 
From the land of the Shamrock green, 
We march, Sze. 
Should America call on her soldier boys,

We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great St. 
Patrick's day, 
With fifes and drums, a 
playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band 
Oh! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's band. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
eyes; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash, when the Mar-
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh! don't their hearts go pit-a- pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, &c. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emerald Hall, and an illegant supper 
too,— 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat for 
you, 
With pickled stews, and hullabaloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
gans band; 
Oh! it's then we sung, and danced a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, Sze.

Air.—" Eileen Alanna." 
A 
lean banana, decayed to the core; 
Ever since I 
slipped on thy peel I 
feel so sore; 
On my back I 
linger'd just where I 
fell, 
The sweet words I 
uttered would not do to tell. 
If I 
could have caught that dirty-looking gawk 
Who threw that banana peel on the walk; 
It made me see stars that I 
never saw before— 
A 
lean Banana from some foreign shore. 
CHORUS. 
Lightly I 
tread on the sidewalk ever since, 
A 
lean banana, I've heard of you before, 
I 
slipped on thee:once, 
be cautious evermore; 
A 
lean banana, I 
love thee no more. 
A 
lean banana, you've caused many a 
sore; 
I 
slipped on thy peel and it turned me o'er and o'er; 
Young girls have blushed, too, when thrown off their pegs, 
Slipping on a 
banana and showing their legs. 
Many are the pedestrians you've caused to fall— 
Great, big and little, lean, lank and tall; 
The seats of fat men's pants you've busted and you've tore— 
A 
lean banana from some Dutch grocery store.

tread on the sidewalk ever since,

A 
lean banana, I've heard of you before,

slipped on thee once, I'll be cautious evermore,

Old Log Cabin in the Lane. 
Sung by IKE, in Rovrax Howesn's great play of 
" 
BAFFLED," 
Arranged by L. C. CHAMBERLAIN. Published by EDWAUD 
No. 861 Broadway, Nevr York. 
I 
am growing old and weary now, my sight is getting dim. 
And my work on the earth is nearly done; 
Old massa has departed, I 
soon will follow him, 
And my friends have cross'd the river one by one. 
Oh, 'tis saci ..
co bid good-by to all that was so dear, 
For I'll never see those good old times again; 
And I 
miss the happy voices that I 
fondly use 
In my little old log cabin in the lane! 
Ah, yes, I 
am 
in 
CHOU& 
to hear 
old and feeble now, my head is bend-
g 
low, 
And I 
never more shall hoe the corn again! 
Yet the angels they will lead ms, when my time has 
come to go, 
From my litle old log cabin in the lane! 
Dance. 
Oh, I 
once was happy all the day, and never knew a 
care, 
And my good old wife she wander'd by my side; 
Our little home was humble, but happiness was there— 
'Twas the sweetest spot in all the world so wide 
55 
Now 'tie sinking to decay, and all is dark and sad 
And I 
hear upon the roof the falling rain 
E'en the banjo now is silent, that once 
glad 
In the little old log cabi 
made my heart so 
in the lane! 
Ah, yes, I 
am old and feeble, &e. 
So I'll totter to my journey's end and try to do my best, 
Tho' rin sad and weary-hearted all the day; 
The angels soon will call me, I 
soon will be at rest, 
In that bright and happy home so far away. 
Still I 
linger by the door and try to sing my song 
Is I 
used to do among the sugar cane; 
toad I'm waiting for the summons, and it soon will come 
along 
To my little old log cabin in the lane! 
CELOBVS. 
Ah, yes, I'm old and feeble now, my head is bend-
ing low, 
And I 
never more shall hoe the corn again! 
Yet the angels they will lead me, when my time has 
come to got 
From my little old log cabin in the lane. 
As 14tng by Arr. Itom..us HOWARD, 111 hi!; imegualed r( di-
tion of " St. Clair," in that famous Drama, 
throughout America. 
" 
ST. CLAIR TO EVA." 
Childless, desolate this heart, 
Naught on carth is left to cherish, 
Every hope and joy must part— 
Every hope and joy will perish. 
Eva, Eva! charming daughter, 
Smile upon me from above ; 
Open. wide those gates of pearl, 
E:ess me with thy Heavenly love; 
Art thou gone from me forever ? 
Shall I 
nevermore behold thee ? 
Oh! my heart and soul's affection, 
What is now, this world to me ? 
Home is silent, dread and drear, 
Uncle Tom is seen to weep ; 
Topsy lingers near thy bier, 
Strewing roses at thy feet. 
Eva, Eva! lovely daughter, 
Are those sweet lips closed and cold, 
That so gently spoke of Heaven, 
Emblem of an Angel's mould ? 
Angel of divine perfection, 
Loved by all, enslaved and free; 
Oh! my heart and soul's affection, 
What is now this world to me ? 
GOLLY, AINT I 
WICKED! 
Oh! white folks, I 
was neber born, 
Aunt Sue raised me on de corn, 
Send me errands night and morn; 
Ching a-ring, a-ring a 
ricked. 
She used to knock me on de floor, 
Den bang my head agin de door, 
And pull my har out by de core; 
Oh! golly, aint I 
wicked. 
Oh! eat de cake and hoe de corn, 
I'se de gal dat neber was born— 
Speck I 
grow'd up some dark morn; 
Oh! golly, aint I 
wicked. 
Oh! Massa Clare he bring me here, 
Put me in Miss Feely's care— 
Don't I 
make dat lady stare; 
Ching a-ring, a-ring a-ricked. 
She has me taken, clothed and fed, 
Den sends roe up to make de bed, 
I 
puts de foot into de head; 
Oh! golly, aint I 
wicked. 
Oh! eat de cake and hoe de corn, 
I'se de gal dat neber was born— 
Speck I 
g
-rowed up some dark morn; 
Oh! golly, aint I 
wicked. 
I'm going to sing of an odd little phrase, 
Of which you have heard, I've no doubt; 
Ask your friends any question, their answer will be 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
You'll hear this expression each day in the week, 
In the town, If you're roaming about, 
And every one's gone on this quaint little speech— 
" 
I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
CHORUS. 
There's many flash sayings in use now-a-days, 
You'll hear them while strolling about; 
But the strangest of all things I've heard is just this— 
" 
I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
A man falls in love with a 
pretty young girl; 
And is anxious to make her his bride; 
His money he spends taking her out at night, 
Or out on the road for a 
ride. 
lie's " giving her taffy," the young men all say, 
His wardrobe is all " up the spout;" 
When he asks her to marry, her answer will be: 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
There's many flash sayings, Ice. 
If you go out at night and get fearfully tight, 
And try to be one of the gang, 
The chances are great that you'll get in a 
fight, 
And some one will give you a 
bang, 
And when it is morning, you're taken to court, 
And the judge asks what you were about, 
If you don't answer quick, why he surely will say: 
"I'll give you six months to find out." 
There's many flash sayings, Sm. 
The great events of the past year, my friends, 
Were the stealing of young Charlie Ross, 
The trial of Beecher, who still wants to pray, 
And the flight of the once famous " Boss." 
And no one can tell where sweet William has gone— 
In fact, it's a 
matter of doubt; 
But if you are anxious to know where he is, 
"I'll take a 
day off and find out." 
There's many flash say'

With the Science and Art of Dressing with Taste. Personal beauty 
ways has and always will exert a 
powerful influence upon the destinies 
of the world. Every individual is affected more or less by its power. It

pearing to the best advantage, whether in person or dress, this book par-

these defects, and in nearly all cases to become, if not absolutely fasci-
nating, to become beautiful, elegant and graceful, and to be admired and 
sought after by the opposite sex. 
To those to whom Nature has been 
more liberal, attentions to the suggestions laid down here will so en-
hance their charms as to make them dangerously fascinating and sur-
passingly beautiful.

" 
I 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Funnies, 98 Nas-

Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the had habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
'where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat littls 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. Fissimt, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus op. randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

the answers more diversifi-d than any edition ever before published ia

any mutilated copy can possibly be.

derive information, and for the purpose of regulating their future con-

practised manipulator taking it up and flirting ths leaves 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit • the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A 
little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."— Phil. Eve. Bull..

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We brie 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cirds will overcome the ,diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
