:30-3:00
 
Discussant :
 Alessandro Falassi
 
K
enneth L. Ketner , Texas Tech University : "Further Thoughts Arising
 
from the Grammar of Folklore"
 
These comments represent a further development of an earlier
 
paper in which I concluded that there was no determinate set
 
of phenomena named by "folklore."  Moreover, the term i
s habit-
ually interpreted in several biased ways.
 I
n this paper, I
 
suggest that a careful examination of the work of s
cholars who
 
call themselves "folklorists " would show that they have been
 
s
tudying universal human behavioral patterns and interactional
 
processes.
 
Richard A
. Naylor , UCLA: "Phenomenal Loss and Contexting i
n Folklore
 
Research"
 
The features of phenomenal loss are described as they occur in
 
certain kinds of folklore d
a
a
t. The implications of phenomenal
 
l
oss are then related to the work done by the folklorist when
 
confronted by these features.  Contextii�j is described in terms
 
of its presence in the world as a practical enterprise.  The
 
relationship of contexting to phenomenal loss and the implica-
t
ions that contexting has for folklore research are then dis-
cussed.
 
Donald Ward ,
 UCLA : "The Satirical Song : Text Versus Context"
 
Although it is generally acknowledged that the circumstances
 
surrounding the performance of a given i
tem of f
olk poetry are
 
of equal importance to the text , seldom does one encounter a
s
 
impressive a confirmation of this contention as i
s true in
 
the case of the public performance of satirical verse.  One
 
could almost contend that there are no satirical songs per s
e
 
but only songs which under certain circumstances can be used
 
for the purpose of lampooning a chosen victim.
 
Don Brenneis ,
 UC Berkeley: "About Those Scoundrels I
'll Let Every-
one Know :
 Challenge Singing in a Fiji I
ndian Community"
 
This paper presents a rhetorical interpretation of "
song
 
challenges," one genre of folksong performance i
n a F
iji
 
I
ndian community . After discussing the ethnographic con-
text of these performances, the paper describes their s
tyle,
 
setting, content and procedures.  The analysis of challenge
 
s
inging provides both an outline of central moral a
nd so-
cial concerns in the village and a procedural model for the
 
overt presentation of such issues.

Graphic evidence of medical` folklore i

ound i
n prehistoric
 
pictography.  At numberous petroglyph or pictograph s
ites, and
 
i
n related pictography of western North America, s
pecial anthro-
pomorphs are portrayed which suggest supernatural beings, gods,
 
medicine men, sorcerers, or shamans.  Special z
oomorphs and
 
symbols are s
hown which appear to be associated with magic, the
 
supernatural, luck, health, a
nd the practice of medicine or
 
s
hamanism.  I

Byrd Howell Granger, University of Arizona: "The God's Eye i
n Many
 
Cultures"  (

The god's eye symbol, best known i
n the S
outhwest and West
 
as part of Mexican culture, and s
pecifically a
s part of
 
Huichol I
ndian (
Mexico) culture, exists i
n multiple cul-
tures elsewhere i

iewing of
 
s
lides s
howing the application of the god's eye s
ymbol i
n
 
rituals and ornament from South Africa to tribes of North
 
American I
ndians.  I
n many instances, the god's eye can be
 
shown to represent a sun symbol in the mythology and beliefs
 
of the cultures employing the symbol.  I
n others, evidence
 
has not yet been obtained to demonstrate an underlying be-
l
ief associated with the god's eye symbol.
 
Mari Lyn Salvador, UC Berkeley: "Cuna Ritual I
llustrated i

Designs"  (

Cuna women incorporate i
llustrations of traditional myths and
 
rituals (
as well a
s the political posters and Coca Cola adver-
tisements for which they are famous) i
n their Molas, blouses
 
constructed of reverse applique panels.  I
n this paper the
 
traditional designs will be discussed.

The l

l
ittle girls to young l

And an analysis of l

An investigation of a number of folk expressions used by A
ir
 
Force pilots to describe themselves, their a
ircraft, and the a
ct
 
of flying.  The interpretation, supplemented by examples from
 
other genres, will be primarily Freudian, relating the f

James Porter, UCLA: "Toward a Conceptual Performance Model of Jeannie
 
Robertson's '

slides a
nd tapes)
 
From a study of a number of separate recordings of Jeannie Rob-
ertson s
inging "Son David," s
ignificant deductions can be made
 
concerning the s
inger's conceptual model of the song.  Each re-
corded performance exhibits distinctive s
tructural and textual
 
differences, and this paper attempts to i
ndicate how such adap-
t
ive transformations contribute to a perception of a uniquely
 
dynamic song model within the s

Stephen Lustig: "Social Action Styles in English a

-A Content Analysis"
 
This paper asks the question: do folktales really reflect a
 
specific culture and, if so, how do they choose to communicate
 
this information?  The method developed produces the answer:
 
yes,  folktales do reflect c
lear and consistent cultural pat-
terns, and communicate these in fairy tales.  The i
nteractions
 
of folktale actors in specific social s
ituations are shown to
 
be consistent within every actor category, but different be-
tween the American and British samples.

The Chamula I

Modern folk medical beliefs regarding the transmission and cure
