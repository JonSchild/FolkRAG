Nickerson:  Okay. So, this is Ginger Nickerson. And I am interviewing Rhonda Mace at the 
Chittenden Solid Waste District, at their Edushed in Williston, Vermont. So Rhonda, I always 
start by asking everyone what year they were born and where they were born. 
Mace:  I was born in 1973 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, home of Yuengling Lager. Just thought 
I’d throw that out there. It’s famous. 
Nickerson:  So can you tell me what your current job is? 
Mace:  Yeah. So I educate kids on how to take care of the earth by practicing reduce, reuse and 
recycle. And technically my job title is school outreach coordinator. 
00:01:05 
Nickerson:  So can you tell me what you did before you were a school outreach coordinator, and 
what your pathway was to getting to this job? 
Mace:  Ah. So right before here, before I took this job, I was a bug-ologist. No, just joking. I 
worked for the state and for the feds collecting and identifying invasive and exotic insects and 
then teaching the public about how they can help to identify them and to stop their spread. And 
what got me there was, well, I have a degree in biology from Virginia Commonwealth 
University out of Richmond, Virginia. Then I moved up here and I got a job with the state, with 
the fish health lab. And then that was just part time, temporary, actually just temporary. That 
ended and then I applied for a chemistry job with the ag[riculture] agency. And then I got tired of 
that and I didn’t like working for the state. I needed more stimulation in my job, let’s put it that 
way. I need to always be looking for the new. Always. I just need to be solving new problems. 
And that wasn’t doing it for me. So I quit that job and got a degree in education.  
And then there weren’t any teaching jobs because the recession hit. And that was a stupid 
time for me to quit my job. So then I worked a couple of part time jobs, but one of those being, 
both of the bug jobs. And that’s how I landed the bug jobs. Then I was substitute teaching as 
well. Long-term subbing in between there, because both of the bug jobs were part time, 
temporary. And there were always breaks of not having a job with those jobs. And so then I 
would teach, long-term teach, which is what I wanted to do forever, wanted to teach science. But 
just nobody’s leaving their jobs, and I just can’t wait forever for somebody to leave their job. 
2 
 
 It’s good you can edit this. So then this job came along at Chittenden Solid Waste 
District. And I was like, hmm, I guess I’ll apply. I mean, I’ve already developed an outreach 
program for the forest pests, so it’s not that much different. It’s still science, still environmental 
science, and it’s teaching. So I’m still kind of getting it all in there. And so I’ve been here for 
four years now. 
00:03:50 
Nickerson:  So can you walk me through a typical day? 
Mace:  There isn’t a typical day. Which is what I love about this job, that there’s never a typical 
day. I can be teaching two year-olds in the morning and grad students in the afternoon. So I have 
to be very flexible with my teaching abilities. My teaching degree is for high school. So I’m used 
to teaching tenth and eleventh grade science. So when I started this job and I was getting calls 
from like pre-Ks, I’m like, oh, man, I have no idea how to teach little kids. Like no clue. The 
reason I like big kids is they can read, they can write, they can use the bathroom. All that good 
stuff. I don’t have to do any of that. But these kids…..ooh. But it actually came a lot easier. And 
I’ve had some fantastic teachers that I’ve worked with over the last four years that have guided 
me in how to better reach that kid population, or that age range.  
 
So tomorrow, I’ll be going to a pre-K in Williston. And I’ll start with the three year-olds, 
or the four year-olds. Move through five year-olds, and then wind the day up with two year-olds. 
And this will be the youngest I’ve ever taught, so I’m not sure how that’s going to go. But hey, I 
like to fly by the seat of my pants. 
00:05:16 
Nickerson:  So what are the activities that you’re planning on doing with all of those different 
age groups tomorrow? 
Mace:  All right. So tomorrow’s program is Trash Talking and the 3 Rs, all right? So we’ve got a 
couple of different programs that have developed over the last four years. So what I do is I bring 
in a bag of typical everyday trash. Not real trash. It’s all clean, if you will, trash, that’s 
representative of what goes to the landfill here in Chittenden County. So it will have paper in it, 
it will have recyclables, it will have food scraps, it will have some shirts and things in it that 
don’t need to go to the landfill. And then we talk about the three Rs, and what reduce, reuse and 
recycle all means. And they give me examples to their best abilities of what each of those words 
mean. We have a little dance that we do with each one, like thumbs down for reduce, and we do 
like the walk symbol for basketball for reuse. And then throw your arms out for recycle. And 
then I always like to throw in the fourth R, which is respect. And they hug themselves. Because 
when we practice the three Rs, we respect ourselves, our friends and Mother Earth. So we get 
through that first. 
3 
 
 
And then we get to the sorting of things. So then they’ll pick an item out of the trash bag, 
or I hand it to them because sometimes it takes them twelve years to pick out one item. So, I’ve 
learned. See, these are things that I’ve learned over the years. Start handing out items. And then 
they have to tell me, identify what the item is, what it’s made of, which I thought would have 
been easy. But when you’re four or five years old, you have absolutely no idea what things are 
made of. So it’s really funny to listen to them pick up a Pringles can and say it’s made out of 
chips. That’s why I love it, because there’s always new things every time I do this. 
 
And then we go through it, we do a little exploration. What does it sound like, what does 
it look like, how can we identify what things look like or what they’re made out of by looking at 
it or listening to it? Like metal’s shiny and it has that ting ting sound to it. There’s strong paper, 
there’s weak paper, cardboard. We have a great time.  
 
So we go through, every kid describes what they have, what it’s made out of, and then 
which bin. Does it go in the trash? Does it go in the recycling? Or does it go in the compost? And 
so then they put it in the right bins, and they help each other out, because we can’t do it without 
teamwork. And at the end then I say, “Look, this is all we have to send to the landfill. Out of 20 
items, only four of them have to go to the landfill, because we sorted properly.” 
 
And will they retain ten minutes from that? Probably not. But they are inspired and 
encouraged to do so. And then they just ask a lot of questions. 
00:08:06 
Nickerson:  And do you talk about the landfill beforehand? 
Mace:  Trashcan in the earth. Yeah. Yeah. So I’ve had to, it’s funny, because it’s I called it a 
landfill the first couple of times. And they’re just ah, the landfill. And I’m like, you’ve got to 
find a better term for that. And I’m like oh! big trashcan in the earth. So I show them a picture of 
a diagram of one. And then I show them a picture of the real one. And I usually ask them, “Do 
you think this makes the earth happy or sad?” And they all go, “Sad.” And then I say, “Well, 
what’s awesome is that with your help, we can make Vermont cleaner and greener.” And that’s 
when we go into the three Rs. So they’re all like, oh, yeah, heck yeah, Earth Rangers!  Like that. 
00:08:52 
Nickerson:  And then what about, I think you said you also work with high school and college 
kids. 
Mace:  Yeah. 
Nickerson:  What do you do with a college class? 
Mace:  Oh, so then that I’d go into a whole lot more depth of how does a landfill work? Why is it 
important we keep stuff out of the landfill, like all of your organic matter makes methane gas. 
4 
 
And although our landfill collects it, it doesn’t for the first ten years, really. Probably thereafter. 
So I just go into a lot more sciencey depth with them, bigger words, that kind of thing. We’ll 
have quizzes. But we still do a sorting game. I don’t care how old they are. Always a sorting 
game. Because when it’s hands-on and people have stuff in their hands, they learn. I don’t care if 
you’re two or 52, that’s just the way it goes. So we’ll always have a sorting game. I usually use a 
presentation with them as well with a lot of different pictures. And address the natural resources 
that it requires to make all this. Go much more in depth of how they can reduce by better 
shopping actions. Obviously five year-olds do not shop for themselves. But they can encourage 
their parents to buy a big jug of juice as opposed to tiny little juice boxes. 
00:10:03 
Nickerson:  With the older students, have you ever done waste sorts with them? 
Mace:  Oh, yeah. So that’s a good point, too. Trash on the lawn day is what I call them at 
schools. So we collect the trash for one day and dump it out on a tarp. I’ve got one coming up 
this Thursday, as a matter of fact, at Shelburne Community School. So that will be fourth graders 
doing that sort. So it’s their team, Team Alpha, is working on sustainability issues this year, this 
school year. And one of the things that the kids were noticing was that maybe they could use a 
little refresher on what goes where. But you don't know you have a problem until, well, until you 
identify it. So one of the things that the trash on the lawn days do is help identify where the 
issues are. What’s getting thrown away as trash that doesn’t need to be trash, and where is it 
coming from, so we can go right to the problem. At their school, they have a sustainability 
committee as well. Adults. So they’re very curious. And I’ve worked pretty closely with that 
school. And that’s a K through eight school. So we’re doing just five through eighth grade, and 
then we’ll see about the K through fourth. Because they tend to generate a lot more trash, which 
takes a lot more time. They’re time-consuming. And I used to have schools all the time doing it. 
Well, one year I had eleven different sorts. And it is time-consuming. Very time-consuming. For 
me especially because even after the sort, then I have to take all that data and I analyze it and 
then write a full report for the whole school. 
00:11:39 
Nickerson:  You can’t have the kids do the data-- 
Mace:  Oh, they could, sure. But in the fourth grade, it’s going to take them forever to do it. High 
school, they could. I don’t actually do many with high schools. It’s usually middle school or 
elementary school. Yeah. 
00:11:58 
Nickerson:  What kind of feedback do you have from the students when you do the trash on the 
lawn? 
5 
 
Mace:  Usually at first it’s like, “Ew, God, this is really, really gross!” And they don’t want to 
really participate. And then they get into it. And then they start understanding like oh, it’s gross, 
because we’re not putting things in the right spot. That the grossness is coming from food scraps 
getting tossed in the trash instead of the compost. And then I always point out to them, if you 
think this is gross, what do you think your custodians are feeling every single day? All because 
you guys don’t take the time to stop, think and sort it all out. And hopefully they leave at the end 
of the sort with a better idea of why they should be. Not just because it’s like save the 
environment, but help people out with their jobs. Don’t be a jerkface, make somebody else’s job 
just that touch easier than it needs to be.  
 
But usually it’s pretty eye-opening. Like, “Why are people throwing whole pencils 
away?” And I’m like, I don't know, they’re your friends. Why are they throwing them away? 
And typically they’re just like, yeah. Huh. And I don't know, I mean, some schools go through 
some big changes. And other schools, it’s like I write a report and the kids really want action, 
and it kind of doesn’t go anywhere. It just depends on the school. 
00:13:21 
Nickerson:  So you just mentioned janitors. Do you work with janitors when you’re working in 
schools? 
Mace:  Sometimes, yeah. So like Burlington School District, I’ve done two years in a row, I’ve 
talked with their custodial, chatted with them at their custodial in-service during February break. 
We had a lot of understanding that came out of the first meeting, actually. I’m not supposed to 
just go talk to them, but then I opened up the floor at the end for questions and comments. And 
the two supervisors, well I guess they’re actually head of facilities or something, both of them, 
were there. And the superintendent was there as well. And just a lot of interesting things came 
out of them, such as the classrooms suck at recycling, is basically what they were saying. And 
that the teachers, some of them are cool, but many of them treat them like dogs. And that they 
don’t hear when the custodian’s like, “You can’t put milk cartons, full of milk, especially, in the 
recycle bins.” And they end up trashing some of the recycling because it’s so contaminated, so 
ruined with food and what not. And that the teachers don’t take the time to teach their students 
what goes where. 
 
So with that information, I tried to move forward through that school district to educate 
the teachers. Like every staff meeting or faculty meeting. And I got nowhere. So it’s kind of sad 
to me. And I realize that some school districts have better things to talk about. But I think this is 
an important thing to talk about. I think it’s often overlooked because it’s, you know, solid waste. 
I wish we had a better name, like, I don't know. Like magic land or something. Save the earth 
land. I don't know. I wish there were better words, terms for it, and more importance put on it. 
Emphasis put on it. And there was one school, and yeah, can I come down with a hammer and be 
6 
 
like, “Look, if you don’t clean this up, we’re going to have to come in and fine you.” And I had 
to do that at one school. And it worked. Because they got a notice. 
00:15:39 
Nickerson:  Because Vermont has legislation now mandating -- 
Mace:  Because Chittenden Solid Waste District has legislation. It had nothing to do with the 
state. It had to do with us. We’ve mandated recycling in this county since 1994. So the state, 
great, yeah. I mean, yeah, that’s a nice little cloud over a nice little, whatever, [pall?] to help you 
out. But we don’t, CSWD doesn’t need that [pall?] at this moment. For food scraps, we are going 
to, because we don’t have an ordinance on that. But we do have stuff on contamination. And say 
food scraps were contamination in, actually, not in the food scraps, it’s a lie. Blatant lie! 
Contamination in recyclables, and then recyclable material in the trash. So we do have 
ordinances on that. So for this particular school, I had to issue a violation. Which, you get three 
chances to fix the problem. And I hate being a regulator. I’d much rather be an educator. But 
they weren’t hearing me, and they weren't taking me seriously. And I was there trying, and I 
would spend a fair amount of time there. But then they didn’t want to take what I had to and fix 
their own problem. It’s just like, “Oh, well, the kids are different when you’re here.” Well that’s 
not my problem, to be honest with you. You need to fix the problem and get them to do the right 
thing. I have no idea how that happens. It’s your school. And then da, da, da, da, da, months and 
months and months. I spent hours there. At one school. And there’s 76 public schools and private 
schools, not to mention colleges, and not mentioning pre-Ks. But just K through eight schools in 
our county. And there’s one. One recycle Rhonda. And I spent hours at their school, and they 
still didn’t listen. So I was like, there you go. The hammer came down. And then they listened. 
00:17:39 
Nickerson:  Are there other schools where the whole school is onboard with reduce, reuse and 
recycle? 
Mace:  Definitely. I mean, it’s hard to like every single classroom if you have 40 classrooms. But 
overall, yeah. I mean, for example, Brewster Pierce Memorial School in Huntington. Fantastic. I 
think CP Smith out of Burlington does a fantastic job. They have a lot of teachers that are, and 
administration. And their custodial staff and kitchen staff are big into like “let’s reduce our 
waste, let’s reuse whatever we can.” Colchester High School is another one. They have a green 
team of 26 students. That’s a huge green team for a high school. Sometimes you’re struggling to 
get six or seven kids to sign up, and they have 26 this year. And they’ve made a lot of different 
changes there. And I usually work with them every single year on a project. This year we’re still 
working, it’s still early, so we’re still working on what that project’s going to be. But last year 
they implemented little fridge in the cafeteria so if a kid takes a parfait yogurt, and they have to 
take it, because it doesn’t count as a reimbursable meal if they don’t, but they don’t really want 
it, they can put it in this fridge. So it’s a give or take fridge, basically. Give and take fridge. The 
7 
 
kids were, at first they were using it a lot. The kids were even taking stuff out of it. But now it’s 
like a lot of people, I guess the students don’t really know what it’s there for. So they just kind of 
put it in there without announcing what it was. So that was one thing that we were going to do a 
little campaign on. Or they were going to do a campaign on that. Because they were like, “How 
can we fix that?” And I’m like, you could just announce it. 
 
It’s just like sort stations. When kids come into schools and they go to lunch, everybody 
just assumes, hey, yeah, they’ll know what to do. But you didn’t even talk to them about it.  How 
are they supposed to know what goes in all these bins? Did they [unclear] last year? Yeah. Are 
they new to the school? High probability. Have they come from fifth to sixth grade and the 
system is different? Uh, yeah. So they should have a moment where they send everybody to the 
cafeteria, each grade level, and show them how to use the sort station. And these are things that I 
will pass on. Especially when we do trash on the lawn days, I have a report that I write up and 
send it to everybody. And some of my recommendations are just that. Annual, if not biannual, 
education. Because, you know, practice, practice, practice.  
Even the adults are, you know, they need help. A lot. Hence the recycle bins that don’t 
look great. And I hear teacher say it all the time, “Oh, no. I know what I’m doing.” And then I 
look and I’m like, no, you don’t. And that’s okay. Because it’s school, and we’re here to learn. 
But if you take that attitude—and I’m not saying all teachers, and I’m not dogging on teachers, 
because I am one—but if you take that attitude, then what are you telling your kids? Oh, at a 
certain age you stop learning? Come on, now.  
And when I taught at BFA, my kids went through that recycle bin at the end of the day 
every single day. They got ten minutes, one kid got ten minutes at the end of the day for a 
participation point. They went through the recycle bin to make sure it was right, that everything 
in the bin was recyclable. And looked in the trash to make sure there’s no paper or anything in 
the trash. And then they took the bucket of food scraps up. Because I was like, if you guys want 
to eat in a science lab, slush classroom, gross. But you’re going to be taking care of those food 
scraps. One, they ain’t going in the trash. And two, I’m not eating in here. So somebody’s taking 
that up. It unfortunately had to be a seventh period class every day but Wednesday. Then it was 
fourth period class. And they were not thrilled with it. Nobody volunteered. Well, except for the 
super, super-duper students who didn't really need participation points. “Oh, oh, oh! Any more I 
could get, if I could get 117 in your class, that will be great!”  
But then after a while the kids got into it. Because they saw it was important to me. And I 
would go through it and be like, “Guys, this? Not the recycle bin, all right? This does not go in 
there.” Or I’ll be like, “Oh, my gosh! This is paper in the trash can!” I’d make this huge deal out 
of it. Jokingly. But they saw how important it was to me. And by the end of, so I taught there for 
four and a half months, that class. And by the end, I didn’t have to draw names anymore. I had 
all but one student, who didn’t like me and he wasn’t going to do anything I asked him to do. 
8 
 
And that’s fine. But they were all like, “Oh, yeah, I’ll do it today.” And I’m like, okay, great. 
This is fantastic. 
00:22:46 
Nickerson:  So what do you think makes the difference between the schools where more of the 
staff and administration is on board with reduce, reuse and recycle? In those schools where it’s 
really low-priority for them. 
Mace:  I don't know. That’s a good question. I think everybody shoots for socioeconomics, and 
that’s definitely not it. Definitely not it. From what I see, anyway, in our county here. I think it’s 
X number of advocates that are, whether it’s the principal or five teachers that band together, or 
you know, a custodian that is above and beyond like, “Oh, no. We’re doing it this way.” I mean, 
I think it only takes one person, really, to make the change. And you’ve got to be inspiring of 
other people. But sometimes it’s admin, you know, and sometimes you just can’t get them 
onboard. And they have other things to worry about. And I get that. And some schools are really 
struggling, really struggling, with feeding their kids or making sure their kids actually go to 
school or get home, either way. And are safe. So [unclear] or how are we going to pay people? 
Or afterschool program, whatever. And I understand that. And maybe some are just not aware of 
the importance, and how it can save them money. And I know they get drowned with emails. So 
I used to send out a yearly email, like, “Hey, happy”—I stopped doing that because I’m realizing 
that nobody’s really looking at that. They’re like (makes disgusted sound) whatever, delete. So 
I’m trying to actually find new tactics. And I think part of it is getting into the school via one 
teacher. Getting my foot in the door. Making an impact with that particular class. And then be 
like, oh, other classes want it. Oh, let’s do a whole school-wide hoopla. 
00:24:58 
Nickerson:  Yeah. So can you tell me about classes where you’ve been able to make that 
connection with a teacher and integrate this into the curriculum? 
Mace:  Yeah. I’m trying to think which school I want to—so there’s a couple, actually, this year 
that I’ve been doing working with kindergarteners. And it started with Allen Brook School in 
Williston. I taught all six kindergarten classes. And I taught them three different lessons on three 
different days. And then like one of the kindergarten teachers talked to another kindergarten 
teacher at Summit Street School in Essex. So then the next year I went there and did all of their 
kindergarten classes. 
 
And then Summit Street, the kids, because they served straws at lunch, one of their 
challenges for reducing was to say no to the straw. Go straw-free. So the kindergarteners took a 
pledge. “I’m going to go straw-free!” And they wrote their persuasive piece. Drew, wrote, a little 
bit of everything. I love to watch kindergarten spellings. It’s very fascinating. First graders, too. 
And they posted it up on the way to the cafeteria so that everybody walking to the cafeteria could 
9 
 
see.  “I’m saying no to straws because I want to save the earth. And they’re trash.” And blah, 
blah, blah.  
So the third graders caught on to this. And they were learning a unit about plastic 
pollution in the ocean and so on. And you know, that snowballed. And so then the teachers were 
like, “Hey, Recycle Rhonda, can you come in and talk to the third graders, just 15 minutes about 
why it’s important to say no to the straw.” I’m like, all right. She’s like, “You seem to inspire the 
little kindergarteners quite a bit.” 
And I’m like, “I like to jump around and have fun. And that usually gets everybody 
onboard, whether they want it or not.” 
So I go in and I talk to the third graders. And this one kid’s like, “Hey, guess what? I 
wrote Ramunto’s? in Williston, the pizza place in Williston and was like, ‘I don’t want you to 
use straws because we watched this video and the straw’s stuck in the turtle’s nose.’” And I’m 
like, what?! And he’s like, “You haven’t seen that video?” And I’m like, no. So he shows me the 
video, and the kids were all excited they could teach me something. Which is another reason I 
love this job, because it’s not just me teaching them, it’s me learning from them, too. And so I 
was like, “Whoa, get out of town!” Do you want me to take my hat off? “Get out of town!” So 
then I’m—now I’m distracted. (laughter) So the Ramunto’s writes them back. Thirty dollar gift 
certificate and said, “Thank you for your letter. We’re really looking into not using straws. And 
if we have to, we’ll use compostable straws.” Firmed up with Ramunto’s in Williston? Boom! 
No straws, and the straws they do offer for take out or whatever? Compostable. So, all changed 
from a third grader. 
Then I learned this year, Essex Westford School District, the whole school district 
banned straws. No straws! That’s pretty awesome. Very excited about that. So that’s where it 
caught on from kindergarten to the third grades. This year at Allen Brook I went back to the 
kindergarteners, and then I’ll be doing the first and second graders. They go through K through 
two at that school. So I’m going to go in and do a quick refresher with the first and second 
graders. So it catches on over time. 
Hiawatha is another one. I do all the kindergarteners there, and then this year I’m 
working with the second graders because they got a grant for a greenhouse. And they built the 
greenhouse. We got the greenhouse and all these compost bins. But they have absolutely no idea 
how to compost, which they figured out quickly, the teachers. They were like, yeah, no idea what 
we’re doing with compost. And I’m like, great, that’s why I’m here. And I’ve taught all of those 
kids three years ago. So it will be just a review with Recycle Rhonda. But we’re going to go, so 
as you progress at second grade, we can get in the deep about the compost. We can do compost 
critters, what are doing the composting. They’ll be in charge of forming the compost piles, 
churning them, making sure that they’re well cared for. And we’ll go, that will be a super hands-
10 
 
on, out in the greenhouse. Hopefully it’s warm that year. Because it is in November, I believe. 
But, yeah. That’s how things can progress. 
And even up through the middle school, Essex Middle School. Been wanting to get in 
there for years. And because of what was happening at Summit Street and Hiawatha, they’re 
both in the Essex School, Westford School District, the middle school has called in for help, 
SOS, we need help at lunchtime. The kids don’t know what they’re doing. And again, you’ve got 
sixth through eighth grade that are coming from all different schools. Everybody sorts 
differently, everybody has different sort stations, some don’t have stations at all, they just have 
buckets. And some have really nice stations. So how do you expect— 
00:30:07 
Nickerson:  Tell me what a sort station is. 
Mace:  Oh, nice, all right. So a sort station is like a table. And it has holes in it for each type of 
like thing you want to get rid of at lunch. So typically you’re looking at, like in schools you’re 
looking at, first thing that they’re going to do is dump their milk. So you’re going to have a 
bucket for liquids. Some of them are cabinets that they get made with receptacles underneath. 
Some of them are tables that they sawed out holes and stuck five-gallon buckets in. It just 
depends. It can vary. Some of them are just 55-gallon trash cans with labels on them, all in a 
row. Not recommended. Especially for little kids who can’t put their trays down. 
 
So usually they pour their liquid off. So you got a bucket for liquids. And then typically 
it’s like trash, recycling and then they can scrape their tray into the compost, and then put their 
tray up and their silver, and they’re off and running. So that’s what a sort station is. And it 
allows, like especially the smaller kids to sit their tray down and slide it along and think about 
what they’re doing. But as I said, they do vary. I use “station” loosely. There’s one school where 
it’s like they’ve got pre-K, it’s like pre-K through third grade. And they literally have like 55-
gallon barrels. And that’s it. And it’s like the kindergarteners there are balancing it on their 
knees, putting it on the floor. Kids are stepping on each other. Dumping stuff. And I’m like, 
(discouraged sound). So this year I did talk to the principal. And we offer, CSWD does offer 
grants. So like I talked to the principal at that school. And that’s one principal like I didn’t have a 
lot of interaction with at first. And now like she and I—(makes explosive noise) So I walk in and 
she’s like, “What’s up, Recycle Rhonda?” And I’m like, “Hey, how are you?” So we are working 
on writing a grant for this school. Or she’s working on it. It’s not hard to get a sort station so that 
these kids can sit their trays down and properly get rid of their lunch stuff. So that was good and 
I’m excited about that. I hope it keeps moving forward. But sometimes we can’t always 
guarantee that happens, either. I can only only nag so much. 
00:32:33 
11 
 
Nickerson:  So you do a lot of work in schools. And then are there other big components to your 
job? Other things you do a lot of? Tours? 
Mace:  Oh, yeah, yeah. So I do do tours. I’ll just throw that in there with the schools. So I do do 
tours of all of our facilities. So the materials recovery facility, or the recycle center. We’ve got 
the Green Mountain Compost, which is where we’re at today. We’ve got drop off centers. We’ve 
got six drop off centers. We typically do tours at South Burlington or Williston. And then we’ve 
got the environmental depot where all of the household hazardous waste goes. So I do tours of all 
of those. Sometimes it’s just like a tour of the MRF. 
 
Coming up, we’re going to be doing something I’ve never done with an AP science, 
environmental science class from Colchester High School. We’re going to do four tours in one 
day. Yeah. So they’re going to start off with the depot. Then they’re going to head to the MRF. 
Then they’re going to come here to the compost. Then we’re going to wrap up the day at 
Williston. But we’re going to tie in a lot of different things. I’m actually going to travel with 
them on their bus. And then in between we can talk about different things, like legislature. I 
mean, they’re AP students, so they’re a lot more invested, too, than just say straight—and I don’t 
mean that rudely, but they are. In this, I’ll get like you were talking earlier, or asking earlier 
about what’s the difference, so this I’ll get into like what do we, CSWD, do legislatively? How 
do we interact with the state? How do we change laws or make laws or you know, so on and so 
forth. So we’ll get into deeper about that. Why do we do it? What things do we back and support 
and what don’t we? Why is that? Which I learned a lot about the other day. We have these little 
lunch and learn things once a month. And I learned a lot about the legislative process and about 
how CSWD does like get called on to testify a lot on solid waste issues. 
Nickerson:  Yeah. CWSD being the Chittenden Solid Waste District. 
Mace:  You got it. Yeah.  
00:34:50 
Nickerson:  So what kinds of feedback do you get from people, or from students, after they’ve 
toured the MRF? The recycling facility. 
Mace:  “Wow. Wow. Wow.” There’s a lot of that.  
Nickerson:  (laughs) They say “Wow” a lot. 
Mace:  A lot. Like that’s like the biggest thing. Like afterwards I’ll be like, “What’s the biggest 
thing you got out of that?” “Wow!” Like okay, but what—so I think the people, the real live 
human beings in there that are sorting out all of the recyclables. And for them, they’re like, “I see 
why rinsing it is important.” And I’m like, boom! We don’t just make these rules up for hoo 
haws. I mean, like there’s a reason behind it. And typically with students, I don’t even get into 
like the whole younger kids, like fifth grade and under, I don’t talk about the drop in price for 
12 
 
like dirty recycling. Because frankly, they don’t really care about that. And it doesn’t really 
affect them. This is how I kind of flex my teaching. But for the older kids, I will talk about that. 
But they’re like, “Oh. And it smells.” And I’m like, “And why does it smell?” “Because there’s 
food.” And I’m like, “Yeah. So keep it out, man. Rinse your stuff. Spread the word!” So I think 
it’s our best outreach tool to anybody. 
00:36:19 
Nickerson:  How would you describe the MRF for somebody who hasn’t been there? 
Mace:  It is very active. There’s something going on at all times all over the place. It is like a 
little factory of, I don’t even know. I’ve heard somebody describe it as like the Willy Wonka 
factory. I wouldn’t say that it was like rivers of chocolate or anything. But it is loud, it is dusty, 
and it is a bit smelly. But it is exciting, because we’re looking at going through 185 tons of 
material every single day. Yeah. So that’s about 4,000 pounds or so. Is that right? Forty 
thousand. Excuse me. Forty thousand pounds of material every single day. And you know, 10 
percent of that is not even recyclable material, so you’ve got to deal with that. So it comes in, it 
gets all dumped off a lot of times. These drivers are picking up big dumpsters, so they’re not 
really seeing what’s in there to be like, “Heads up! Bad load” or whatever. So they dump it off 
and it just gets put onto conveyor belts. And it goes and gets sorted out into different material 
types. So like cardboard, glass, and then you’ve got like paper, different types of paper, but they 
all get baled together, or smashed together.  
Then you’ve got containers. Metal containers, plastic containers. But then we even sort 
that further. And we’ve got machines that sort stuff out, which is the physics is a big, huge deal. 
We’ve got these little discs just based on physics and 3-D versus 2-D properties, 2-D things like 
paper will float up over, 3-D property things like containers bounce on back, and that’s how we 
sort it out, separate it into two different streams. But then after that, it’s people. It’s people 
pulling dirty diapers out. It’s people pulling batteries. We’ve just had yet another fire 
smoldering. Not a straight-on fire, but we’ve had four or five, I want to say, fires this year at the 
MRF. Yes, recycle your batteries! Just not in your blue bin. 
And that’s where our job is challenging as well is outreach people, to get the word out. 
And that’s why I think touring the MRF is our strongest. I think everybody should be forced in 
this county to come to the MRF. That would be great. Like it is law. Maybe we can write that 
into our ordinance. (laughs) I’m just joking. I don’t want to force people. I want them to do it on 
their own. But I do think once they see the facility. 
And I just had, it’s interesting, I had 80 ninth graders that came through the MRF and 
Green Mountain Compost. And I was talking to them about cleaning out their stuff. And they 
had just been to the MRF. And I was like, you know, that’s the reason. And they’re like, yeah. 
And I’m like, because you never know, it might be you someday. And they’re all like nah-ah, 
never. And I’m like, never say never. I was like, four years ago, bachelor’s degree, cum laude 
13 
 
graduate, I have to say, and I was shoveling stalls at a horse barn, and cooking, and identifying 
insects for the federal government. So, you never know. Other. And they’re like, uh—And I’m 
like, no. Never know. Their teacher, I just actually got an email, and she was like, “That was 
pretty powerful what you said.” She goes, “And they keep talking about that. And I keep hearing 
kids go like, ‘But you never know.’” I’m like, but you don’t. And that was a true, true story. I 
didn’t make that up. I wish I did. But I did not. 
So, yeah. So I think the human aspect of the MRF is really a big deal. And after they sort 
it all out, then it gets baled into giant bales, just like a hay bale, with metal twine. And then it 
gets shipped off to market. And if we can’t sell it and we’re not making money, then the MRF 
does not work. And that’s another reason why clean stuff is good stuff. Because dirty stuff does 
not sell.  People don’t want to buy moldy yogurt cups. They want clean stuff. 
00:40:51 
Nickerson:  So, what’s your favorite part, or the best part? 
Mace:  Oh, man. That is a really hard question for me. Because I love, I love to see their little 
faces. And I say little faces, but that could be high school kids or college kids. But like light 
bulbs go off. Like whoa, I got it. Whoa, that just totally snapped. I love it. But I also love 
learning from them. I mean, I got taught how to tweet by five year-olds. I didn’t even know what 
Twitter was. I’m like, “What is this Twitter thing you’re talking about?” They’re like, “What? 
You don’t know how to do that?” And that’s how I learned to tweet. It’s from five year-olds! 
 
I also learned the other day that one tree provides enough oxygen for four people. Did not 
know that fact, either. That was also by kindergarteners. So I love being silly but educational at 
the same time. I love walking into a cafeteria and having kids being like, “Recycle Rhonda! Yay! 
Come eat with me!” And not just like a popularity contest, and then they sit there and be like, 
“Reduce, reuse, recycle! Respect!” And it’s like, yeah, you got it! You totally got it! This is so 
exciting! And then we go to the sort station together. And I make them try it out themselves. But 
watching them succeed. Like watching them do it. 
 
Or getting stopped on the street by a parental unit who is like, “Oh. You’re Recycle 
Rhonda.” And I’m like, hmm, I don't know. Am I? Should I be? Is this positive? And she’s like, 
“You’re the reason my kid’s going through our trashcan, making sure that what we’re in there is 
not recyclable.” And I’m like oh, that could possibly be me. Yeah. Yeah. And she’s like, it’s 
cool. And that happened once in Burlington and it was like hysterical. Because I really was like, 
oh, God, oh, my goodness, this lady’s like hating on me. But she was like laughing. She was like, 
no, but he is very vigilant now on checking. So those are the success stories, you know? And 
those are the trickle down. Like now he’s got his family all into it, you know? And then, like he, 
it just is that domino effect. And that’s why I like the younger kids. I mean, not that I don’t, I like 
college kids, because I like getting into the intricacies of teaching, or of the science behind 
different things. But I really enjoy like those littles, the little kids. And I didn’t think I would 
14 
 
enjoy that. I thought when I took this job, I was like, oh, God. I always loved little kids. But I 
liked like running around and playing tag, and that’s about it. And then I’m like, all right, I’m 
done. And I’ve always been a kid magnet. But like this—I just love to see, yeah. I like to see 
their success and then pass it on year after year after year. And know that they got something out 
of that. And even if it’s one thing of I’m going to rinse my yogurt cup out, that’s all I ask. That’s 
all I ask, that you learn one thing to be a better recycler or reduce whatever. Turn the water off. 
Not that it has anything to do with recycling, but turn the water off when you brush your teeth. 
Don’t be wasting water. 
00:44:14 
Nickerson:  So what is either your least favorite or the most challenging part of the position? 
Mace:  Regulating. I don’t like to do it. I don’t like telling people, “You’re doing this wrong. 
And it needs to change, because you are violating laws.” I hate doing that. I have a really hard 
time doing it. I usually do it in like a joking manner, and they don’t take me seriously. So then I 
have to like kind of come back. And I’ll be honest, because I should be, like sometimes I just 
kind of ignore that part and move on. Because I’m like argh, it’s not that big of a violation. I’ll 
just ignore it. Because it’s not that I don’t want to be the bad guy. Often what happens is that it’s 
the wrong people that are taking the hit for what’s going on in the school. Like it’s the custodians 
that are taking the hit, like it’s their fault. And it isn’t their fault. And that’s something I learned 
from Burlington custodians is that they were like, “We’re tired of getting blamed. It’s not our 
duty to sort through their mistakes.” And I’m like, you’re right. They don’t have time. There are 
big schools here that you’ve got two, three custodians that are working through the night trying 
to clean for the next morning. That’s insane! And they don’t have time to stop and sort through. 
And technically, it’s the people that are making, you know, filling the bin, it’s their responsibility 
for sorting it out. So the regulatory side, and a lot because I’m afraid who’s going to get the short 
end of the stick on that. And I feel for the custodians, because I think they often take the brunt, 
despite me going to the principals and saying, “Hey, this needs to change in these classrooms,” 
or whatever.  
And then just being taken seriously, I guess. I don't know. I mean, maybe it’s because I 
do joke about it, or I come at it on a jokey side. But it’s challenging. And it’s challenging to keep 
an eye on seventy-some schools. It’s also challenging with some of the private schools to get 
them interested in food scrap diversion. They’ve got a year and a half to go, and there are schools 
that just ignore me. Totally. And I’m coming at them with, “Hey, I want to help you do this.” But 
then they’re just ignoring me. And I’m like, I don't know if I’m supposed to like bust down your 
door. So there are, yeah. 
And challenges, just working in a team of people with other outreach coordinators that 
don’t necessarily do schools, they do other things. But we all have to work at, do events and stuff 
together. And our minds work very differently. At least, mine does. And it’s not that I can’t 
15 
 
work, I just prefer, I like my job because I’m a solo artist, and I like that. And there are certain 
people I work really well with, and other people that not so much. But that’s also taught me how 
to (exhales) take a breath, let it go, let’s get this job done and hopefully we won’t have to work 
together again for another whatever. But that’s challenging to me. 
00:47:31 
Nickerson:  So thinking about young people who might be thinking about becoming educators in 
your position, what knowledge or skills would you say are required for this job? 
Mace:  Goodness. Yeah. I think, childhood development skills. I just, I was expecting when I 
took this job to work more with high school students than I ever thought I’d be working with K 
through five. Ever. Otherwise, I might have hesitated on taking the job. Because I was like, I 
don’t really know how to teach them. So I would say early childhood, not early childhood 
development, but like K through five, have a little background in that. I know just being an 
educator and having a certification in education helped me a lot. I actually went back to some of 
my books, even though they’re high school, and read through them. So I’m like, okay, what. And 
again, having a lot of teachers that I worked with that were willing to be like, like I’d ask them 
questions all the time. Like, what did I do right? What did I do wrong? What are the learning 
levels here? Am I asking too much of them?  
 
So, college. I think having a science background is helpful, definitely. Especially for like 
understanding compost, I think it’s important to have a science background. Not necessary. 
Plenty of people that don’t have a science background that can understand composting. I just 
think it helps. 
 
Enthusiasm for what you do. If you are not into it, then this job is never going to work for 
you. Because like I love my job, and I love—and I think it’s the science aspect, because I love 
science. But I think it’s all the science aspects of recycling and even like, and environmental. 
Like reducing and reusing. Finding new purposes for old things. And the challenge of like what 
can we do to keep all this stuff out of the landfill? But if you’re not enthusiastic, then I’d say find 
a new job. You know, I think that’s number one, to be honest with you, is the enthusiasm. 
Because it can become infectious to people. Even people that are not super-thrilled about the 
idea. I’ve definitely, on like public tours, even though they chose to go on these tours, people 
that are like (grumbling) and by the end of the tour, dancing or singing songs—not really, I don’t 
sing very well. But making it lighthearted, I think, helps some of the less enthusiastic people 
become more enthusiastic. So I think enthusiasm is important. 
 
And then, you know, even as you’re getting up to like high school or college, interning or 
mentoring, that’s really helpful, too. Like younger kids, or whatever. So you get a feel for what 
it’s like to teach them and what engages them, you know? I think high energy is definitely 
something. I probably get them a little too wound up sometimes. But I am a very high-energy 
person, so I get wound up and then they get wound up. And sometimes we have to all get calmed 
16 
 
down by the teacher. But it’s okay. Because I always tell them, I’m a five year-old in a 45 year-
old body. But I like to have fun. And you just got to love what you do, I think. I mean, it comes 
naturally to me. But it’s because I think I really, I love making a difference in the community. 
And I like, I really love to see their bright faces, like, I did something new! Or I learned 
something new, and now I’m going to take it and do something different. It thrills me to know 
that they’re out there making a difference, you know. And successful. 
00:51:39 
Nickerson:  Is there anything about the job that you wish you had known more about before you 
took it on? 
Mace:  Yeah, I mean, I am a self-starter, but I did feel like there wasn’t a lot of information on 
like what to do or how to do it or how to make contacts at schools. I came with some, just 
because I had done some education in schools around here prior to this job, with the forest pest 
job. And the old person had, the last school coordinator had contacts, kind of. Not really, 
actually, because I didn't get anything from that, really. And then like how to go about the 
regulatory side of it. Like how do you do inspections of schools if you do it? There were, years 
ago they used to do recycling report cards when recycling first became mandatory. And they 
were helping schools to understand what can and cannot be recycled. And so, like how did they 
do that? How did they make contact with schools? I would have liked that. I wish I would have 
known that. I mean, it might have changed, I don't know if it would have changed me taking the 
position. But I think that, I wish I would have had more information. Because still like four years 
later, I’m still like, hmm, still don’t know how to quite get the admin to pay attention to what’s 
going on, and the need that they do need to pay attention to what’s happening to their unwanted 
stuff.  
 
But no, I mean, I think, aside from everyday work things like personality differences and 
so on, I think they were pretty straightforward in what was happening. And because I am a self-
starter, or I’m a self-motivator and independent, it wasn’t difficult for me to like jump in and do 
whatever. It did take me probably a year, year and a half, to get a groove and a feel for where I 
really wanted to go. If it were more directed, it would probably have been a lot faster. But I may 
not have come to the same conclusions or programming that are development today if it was 
more structured. I can see maybe somebody needing more structure in this job. I didn’t. But I 
think my predecessor did need that. 
00:54:20 
Nickerson:  So thinking again about a young person who might be considering this as a career 
move, do you feel like your job provides a livable wage? 
Mace:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I think definitely provides a livable wage. I make pretty decent money. I 
forget exactly what it is, but it’s 24 something—oh, don’t have to, I’m like, that’s okay, I don’t 
17 
 
mind. I mean, it gives an idea. I make 24 something an hour. Great benefits. Get holidays, so on. 
They encourage you, like if you have a cold, please stay home and actually use your sick time. 
Which is like totally different from anywhere I’ve ever worked. Well, I’ve never had sick time. I 
mean, I did when I worked for the state. But all the way through college and stuff I worked at 
Friendly’s. And I couldn’t take time off. Like time off meant I wasn't getting paid. So I’d go into 
work like, you know, colds, huge back problems like I could barely walk. And like I just didn’t 
get any time off, so I couldn’t afford not to work. And now I’m like whoa, if I just have like a 
little sniffle, I can take the day off and get paid for it. So, yeah. I think it’s definitely a livable 
wage. I think they treat people fairly, at the upper echelon, anyway. And I think that comes along 
with having a four-year degree as well.  
00:55:48 
Nickerson:  And it comes with benefits. 
Mace:  It does come with benefits. Yeah. Yeah. Vacation. Three weeks of vacation. 
00:55:57 
Nickerson:  So, thirty years from now, do you think there will be people doing your job? 
Mace:  Yes. I do. It might look a little bit differently, but I always think that we’re going to need 
an educator for reducing our impact on the environment. And we’re always going to need to 
educate people. Because people are going to migrate from elsewhere all the time. New kids are 
coming into school all the time. So yeah. There’s always, I mean, education, you never stop 
learning. Ever. Ever never. And I don’t care if you’ve heard Recycle Rhonda from kindergarten 
every year until like grade twelve. I’m going to see you in college, too. Because the more you 
hear it, the better you get at it. Or the more it sticks in your head. What is that, like eight times 
you have to hear something before it sticks? I don't know. Somebody told me that, but I’m not 
sure I believe them on that, either. But you do have to hear things repetitively in order for them 
to stick. And recycling can get complicated, and it changes.  
And it’s been changing. And it’s changed, you know, a lot in the last four years. More so 
than it did in the 20 years leading up to it. And it’s going to continue to change. Packaging that 
we’re getting is going to continue. I mean, I was just looking at the amount of plastic that we saw 
coming into our MRF in 2009 versus now, and newspaper. And they’re like, opposites. Plastic, 
number one, PET, drinking bottles, through the roof! Newspapers, plummeted. Same with 
cardboard. You can see like a going up of cardboard because people buying everything online. 
So our materials have changed, what we’re getting in there. Hence our needing a new MRF. 
Because our equipment is invalid now, for the most part. Because we aren’t seeing paper. I 
mean, we aren’t seeing newspaper anymore. Mixed paper, yeah, like junk mail and stuff. Say no 
to junk mail. Say no. It’s problematic. That’s all. I forget what the original question was. I’m just 
like ranting now. 
18 
 
00:58:13 
Nickerson:  Oh, if people will be doing your job 30 years from now. 
Mace:  Oh. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it’s like are we going to have teachers 30 years from now? 
Definitely. And we’re going to need teachers to teach about this. I mean, it’s not—oh, you’ve got 
an inchworm on you. It’s not innate knowledge, let’s put it that way. And again, with the 
changing packaging, changing society. More people coming into the area, different people 
coming into the area, new kids being born, yeah. It’s going to be here for, well, as long as it’s 
funded, I should say. And then who knows? They could do away with solid waste districts and 
have the state take over. Who knows? I mean, I don't know about that. But they’re still going to 
need to educate. Because we can’t just like throw stuff willy nilly everywhere. We need to learn 
where things go. And why. 
00:59:12 
Nickerson:  So is there any other advice that you would give a young person going into this job, 
other than what you’ve already mentioned? 
Mace:  Give your solid waste district a call. See if they have a school person, and see if you can 
like tag along with them. And see like hey, you know, that’s one thing I regret, even in college. I 
never really liked, this is not what I planned on doing with my college degree. I wanted to be 
like, oh, a zoologist is really, or an ecologist and be out in the middle of no man’s land, studying 
different things like bats and salamanders. So. Not where life took me. At all. And that’s fine. 
Because I’ve had a great, great run so far. I’ve had some pretty fun jobs and been some pretty 
fun places. But it’s good to check out different things, too. Like hey, let me tag along with that 
school person and see what they’re doing. Oh, yeah, hmm, maybe that’s not for me. Or hey, 
yeah, I’d do that a little differently. Because if they’re a teacher, they should want to learn, too. 
And I encourage you, you can contact me, and I’d love your feedback. Because I love to improve 
and new ideas. But, and I’d be more than happy to show you around. And then they can show 
you their different facilities. And maybe driving heavy equipment is your thing. That’s one thing 
that I plan on learning, too, from this job. So that’s another thing I like about my job, though, is 
that I get to work different jobs. Not just this one, but I work at the drop off centers. And I also 
work at, I work at the depot doing the hazardous waste rover. So I get to put my hands in a lot of 
different pots. And I like that. I like variety.  
But there is something for everybody. Even the equipment operators or the guys at the 
MRF that are doing the sorting, I’m going to see many of them have investment in what they’re 
doing. Not just, “I’m just getting paid.” But they have an investment in doing something, and 
doing it right. And so I think there could be a place for a lot of different people. But check out 
your solid waste district person and tag along with them. And it doesn’t matter if you’re a fourth 
grade or fourteenth grade. Who cares? All you’ve got to do is ask. 
19 
 
01:01:37 
Nickerson:  So, last question. Is there anything that we have not covered that you would like 
people to know about the work that you do? 
Mace:  The thank you notes are fantastic. I did forget to say that. They are so hysterical. I have 
run out of room for all of them. 
Nickerson:  These are think you notes from grade school children? 
Mace:  Yes. Yes. And some from high school students as well. 
01:02:06 
[End Track 1. Begin Track 2.] 
Mace:  And also working, so I didn't talk a lot about the college kids. But that was something 
new that I’ve taken on just in the past year. But working with them on projects is pretty cool, too. 
Because that’s like the advanced part. And so we get to design projects. And I’m hoping that we 
get a part time person next year to help me out. Let’s hope. Because I run thin. And it’s maybe 
something I don’t like about the job all the time is that I just don’t have time to follow up with 
people. Because it’s like, “Hey, I want you here.” “Hey, I want you to do this.” But I’d love to do 
more projects with college kids on, many of them are interested in compost. And it’s something 
that we need to be reviewing, because there’s a lot more food scraps coming in. And we’re at 
capacity. But that’s one area that we would like to work more on. And that we didn’t get to talk 
about. But I did work with a couple of college groups on looking at contamination here at Green 
Mountain Compost. And that was super fun. And I really, really enjoyed that. And it’s just so 
very different. 
Nickerson:  [unclear]  
Mace:  Not really. It didn’t really go the way I wanted it to. And it started off as somebody else’s 
project. That’s my other thing with teamwork. And it wasn’t going to get done correctly. So I 
was like, “I’ll just do it. I’ll write up the protocol.” (laughter) It was a pretty ugly time, actually. 
But it was fun with the kids. I enjoyed it.

Nickerson:  All right. Anything else you wanted to say about working in solid waste? 
Mace:  It’s a dirty job. But my theory, my motto is, dirty hands are happy hands. It doesn’t 
matter how they got dirty. That’s my, that’s it. 
Nickerson:  (laughs) All right. Well, Rhonda, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. 
Mace:  You’re very, very welcome.
