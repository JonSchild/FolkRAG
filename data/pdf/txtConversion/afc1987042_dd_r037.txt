Begins with Patrick J. Mogan in mid-sentence:
P:  Making the big, the big mistake.  They should go back and take the two things.  I'm saying 
that if we go and take culture now, and, and tie that in with economic factors that could 
compliment cultures, we would be doing, we would be doing way the heck more good.
MA:  One thing I was thinking is that you know, if you get, if you get Pepperidge Farm, or you 
know, an outside company to come in, the one thing you'd want to be sure to do is say this is a 
good idea and it's coming out of the community.  Have some kind of clause in there so that they 
share in the royalties.  (P:  No question about it.  Oh sure)  And maybe the (--)  Because it's 
protection of cultural property.  (P:  Oh sure.)  The idea, and that it would go back into a 
community center, or a cultural center, something like sort of proceeds that would (--)
P:  When you go, when you go to a thing, of course I don't know anything on that line.  But let's 
take this.  I wanted someone to do an economic study where they haven't been able to get it done 
now, on the amount of money that is spent say by Greek organizations for cultural conferences 
and conventions around the United States.  Just add that up and do the same with the Polish, and 
do the same with the others.  Now one of the things that we wanted here is in the cultural center 
we wanted every single doctoral work that was done on ethnicity, and culture, and folklife in the 
United States, and the world and bring it here.  We wanted them here.  Then we wanted the 
scholars to come and start working from that.  We wanted a program at the university related to 
this.  Now that's part creating an economic activity too, as well as a cultural.  But now once we 
get that we send a letter to every Greek organization in the United States to say there's an 
intellectual reason now for having your conferences and conventions in the city of Lowell.  And 
do that to every other single one of those groups.  In other words, you, you build up that, and 
then there's (--)  
     Now if you, I have read reports that people's decision on the location of their economic 
activity is more related to personal preference than it is to economics.  And they're talking about 
big plants and everything else.  There's a hell of a lot of politics in the location of that.  All right, 
suppose I'm, I'm the president of one of the chief executive offices of one of those big 
companies, and I happen to be of Polish background.  And I read the thing and say, oh Christ 
sake, we're going to expand.  I can go to Lowell to expand.  See we have the labor force.  The 
labor force doesn't get a hell of a lot of money.  But if you can give recognition to that labor 
force, and you're going to improve their quality of life, now they have something.  They don't, 
they don't have the great amount of money, but they have a terrific quality of life associated with 
that.  And I can see, and we talked about this with Paul before.  That we would have a system of 
education here, kind of an informal one here where every kid here if they wanted to could go for 
six months to a foreign country and live with another family there, which we exchanged with the 
one, one here.  We sell that.  And then the people who were looking for a place where their kids, 
and their executives want to live, they'll live here and then we'll get more than the business 
activity.  We are not getting the captains of industry, or the bosses living here.  If they start a 
business here, they live in one of the other communities outside.  They don't, they don't live here.
You have to give a reason for their living here.
M:  Yeah.  If Lowell High School had you know, kind of a cultural exchange program, where 
every summer you know, dozens, and hundreds of kids were going off to foreign countries, I 
mean that would be a real exciting part of the curriculum that you could attract people to come to
that public high school.  
P:  Sure.  We talked, we talked to some officials in Greece about this, and they're terrifically 
interested in it.
MA:  That's a great idea.  And then the kids would have experience with the language abroad, 
and (--)
P:  Yeah, and because, because see you need, you need the function.  That's what I'm saying.  
Like I had a (--)  In fact (--)
M:  You know who does this?  I saw something on the CBS Sunday Morning News this, this past
summer.  I think it's Wisconsin.  
P:  Oh yes.  [Unclear] for Irish.
M:  They got a very very active cultural exchange program.  
P:  Yes they do, they do have a very (--)
M:  And then they also have something that occurs within the state, where kids from all the 
school systems around the state (--)  It's like a cultural camp.  Like they spend like you know, a 
month or two and they actually become immersed in the different cultures, you know, studying 
the language, studying the geography, studying the customs, studying the history for you know, 
these intensive periods.  And then come together like at the end for all kinds of exchanges and so 
forth.  Um, I'm trying, I can't think of the name of it, but it was, it was really exciting, and the 
kids seemed you know, to be very much taken by it.  
P:  Well see they, see, here's one of the things that go back.  And people, people are, there are 
more small things in life than there are big things.  And it's, if you look at the economic field, or 
the cultural, it's the small things that are going to add up.  It's not the massive things.  Like one of
the big groups that you have in the country, and they're big spenders too, are your uh, hostile 
people.  You know, youth hostiles, and bicyclists.  We should have one of these things here for 
those people to come.  But you want to have that broad smorgasbord to appeal to them.  Things 
that they could come, they could come and see.  Because, because most people, most people 
don't know what to look at when they, when they come (MA:  There's great restaurants here too),
when they come into a community.  But, but I think that the thing on, I had, I had a friend that 
was an executive in Sears Roebuck.  He said to me one time, if you know any bright young 
people with the knowledge of uh, of Spanish and Portuguese, we have many open things in 
South America.  We could give them a good start.  I said I didn't think you'd have trouble getting 
a bright young person with the knowledge of Portuguese and Spanish.  He said, either did we.  
He said, we have gotten these people and sent them down to South America.  They have a 
mechanical knowledge of the language.  They don't understand the culture of the people.  They're
homesick down there.  And after two years down there they're coming back, and we've wasted all
the money we had them trained.  
MA:  They want them to go down and stay.
P:  No, they wanted them to have a feeling for the place that they went.  I mean teaching a 
language out of context is no language at all.  And so, so when you have, when you have 
research that says that to understand the English language you can do it much better if you had 
another functional language as a frame of reference.  Functionality is what we have in here.  We 
don't want to let that, we don't want to let that go.  We want that to be nurtured and used.  
Because you cannot do that in an institution, a formal institution of education.  You have an 
instructional system.  You don't have a learning environment of language.
MA:  I want to ask you something about when you were growing up and doing, making gardens. 
Were you aware of differences between the Irish gardens, and other gardens at all?
P:  No.
MA:  You weren't?
P:  No, no.  No, the only time we came in contact, when we were, when we were caddying.  
Remember I told you the kid by the name of [Bicalauqua?], [Bevilauqua?].  When we would 
caddie there we'd carry out lunch.  And we'd go to the gulf course early in the morning and be 
there until dark.  Then we carried our lunch.  And those Italian kids were stealing our lunches.  
We never stole their lunches, because what the hell, there were peppers, you know, pepper 
sandwiches and the like.  [Laughing]  We never saw those things.  That's what they grew in their 
gardens, pepper.  Then one day we got so damn mad, because they stole our lunches, we'd steal 
those.  We stole them, we ate them, we liked them.  See what I mean by (--)
MA:  So what was in their lunch?
P:  Peppers!
M:  Pepper sandwiches.
MA:  That was all?  Oh, pepper sandwiches?
P:  Pepper sandwiches, sure!  But, but you ordinarily you know, you thought that that was a 
savage type of thing.  You know, that was, who the hell would eat stuff like that.  We, and we 
never tasted it.  
MA:  And what was in your lunches?
P:  Oh, we'd have the traditional sandwiches.  Some roast beef, you know, and bread and butter, 
or tomato sandwich, or something like that.  The meat sandwiches.  But they didn't have 
sandwiches like that.  They, they had a lot of sauce.  You know, they had the wet sandwiches.  
We had the dry sandwiches.  And, but it was that, it was that interaction that, that caused that 
particular thing, that thing to happen.  And I bet that went on two years.  We didn't even touch 
that.  That sandwich used to last there for a week and no one would touch it.  [M:  laughs]  We'd 
go out and caddie and come back, and we had to learn how to carry the things with us.  But it's 
strange how, how you can built up, who the hell would eat that stuff, you know?  Of course, and 
when we had arguments, that's what would come up in the arguments.  
MA:  What, what.  What would come up?  What would you say in the argument?
P:  It's those damn pepper sandwiches you're eating, you know, it makes you as crazy as you are, 
or something like that.  I mean it was always, it was always an ethnic slur based on something 
that they, they had.  But (--)
D:  Pat, what's your opinion of folk festivals?
P:  Uh, if it's a shallow thing where uh, I think the type of folk festival they had the last time in 
here was terrific.  I think the first folk festivals they had in Lowell were, were very good.  But 
then they made the people tired because they were getting the same group of people to prepare 
food and come in for people who didn't understand much about the thing.  And they were, they 
were seeing the [vestal] part of the thing, you know, which were the eats and the thing, and the 
aromas.  They weren't seeing the other side of their life, which was artistic and creative, and 
could provide some entertainment to them.  I'll tell you we had, at one time here we had a 
festival and we, it was more, it was a musical type of festival.  They had the food and the music 
together.  And we had something like five Black churches in the city.  and they got together and 
put on one Black choir.  It was right up in front of city hall.  The remarks that were made by 
people I never knew.  That was the most beautiful thing that the people (--)  People knew another
part of their life.  They didn't know that particular part.  And the sophistication of the way they 
put the thing on.  It kind of opened the eyes of an awful lot of other people.  And then the people 
would come.  But that stopped.  You know that, that part stopped.  (D:  Why?)  Because, well I'll 
give you an example of it.  There was a money making aspect that came into it.  And up in the 
festival they had up on the river, they had a tent, and they had the various cultural presentation, 
but they had the herdi gerdi and the merry-go-round, everything else going around outside, and 
there wasn't any chance.  No, you know, no dignity and respect given to the presentation that was
given on in there.  In other words it was, it was a use of the other people, and they couldn't really 
appreciate it and understand it.  I think that you need, you need another type of festival.  You 
need that big type where you bring the best in the country around.  But you need another type 
where like we wanted to provide instruments to a school.  Say violins.  And with the thing that 
the people in that school would take a song, say a Greek song, a lullaby, and Irish song, a French 
lullaby and the like, and play.  But also when the kids do it their parents have to be part of the 
same orchestra.  And when their practices are going on all the time, that would be opened to the 
public.  And when their presentations are going on, that would be, that's the type of a festival I 
think.  It should be kind of an ongoing type of thing, rather than of once a year.  The once of year
serves as a good thing, because you do get the people from coming all over the place to come 
here.  But I think that the practices and everything they had would be, would be a terrific thing 
for them.  It's almost like down in West Virginia one time, I think everyone could play the violin, 
but no one ever took any lessons on it?  Remember way back?  Well the same, the same thing 
here.  I have, I have a friend that's a musicologist, and he's an expert on the bazooki.  
     And I don't know, you know there are only, we're one of the two dominant Greek community. 
I think Tarpens Springs, Florida, and here.  Either one of us should have that collection here, that 
bazooki collection.  And also if we had the thing here, we could very easily get the kids in the 
Greek school through continual practice and put on these particular (--)  In other words we have 
to nurture it from within the own community, and come out and start doing things of that 
particular thing.
MA:  Are there any Saturday schools in Lowell?  Like the ethnic schools?
P:  I don't think so.  No.
D:  Saturday schools?  There have been some.  There's one connected with the Polish National 
Church.  That really had been discontinued.  
MA:  Like there are ethnic schools where, you know, that meet, meet on like Saturdays, or 
Wednesday nights, or whatever, and they'll teach dancing, or language, or food.
P:  The Jewish, the Jewish people are the only ones that are really doing that now, because 
they've always had after school hours and on Saturday.  But the uh, (--)
M:  But there are, you know, the parishes still you know, have some ethnic identity in the 
Catholic schools associated, the parochial associated with those parishes.  Uh, you know, there is
a sense of that.  You know, and then you do have the Greek School.
MA:  Maybe that's why you don't have them.  
M:  But the bottom, I mean the bottom line really is this sense of giving people a better life both 
economically and socially to have the world make more sense, and also to have ad better 
experience in it.  I think that's what it's all about.  
P:  Well I think too that you don't, if you don't leave the impression that you're doing something 
just for this group, that you're doing something for, for everyone, and there is value in the doing 
of this for, for everyone, that I think you can make, make an awful lot of headway.  On this 
cultural plan that come up, on that committee you got guy by the name of Phoba Hi.  He teaches 
Political Science in Government at the university.  Phoba Hi, (M:  you've met Hi Pho) Hi Pho, 
yeah.  (M:  Yes, you've met him.)  He invited, his father-in-law was the Mayor of Saigon.  I don't 
know if you knew that.  He was living in Lowell.  And uh, (M:  Mr. Ya is his name?)  yeah.  
Phoba, he invited me and my wife up to his house for Thanksgiving.  And when I got there there 
was another group Orlandis.  Lee Orlandi and his brother.  Lee was a Professor at the university.  
His brother was the representative, State Representative from China Town district in Boston.  So 
he said, this is our Thanksgiving.  And so he said, and we're thankful for you two groups of 
people.  So he said, the first one, he started to explain the Orlandis.  He said, Lee Orlandi's 
brother, being the representative and being very acquainted with China Town found out that the 
government was going to fall.  What is he Viet?  (D:  Vietnam)  Yeah, Vietnamese.  (M:  Yeah, Hi
Pho)  Yeah, he found the government was going to fall.  He had inside information that it was 
going to fall.  And the Revolution was going to occur within the say, five, seven days.  So he 
said, she said to his brother Lee, he said, you get to your friend and tell him that he only has a 
very short time to get his family out.  He has to do it immediately.  So Lee went to Pho and said, 
told him this.  He said, if you need money, he said, we'll arrange to borrow some money, give 
you the money to get some family out.  Pho said no, the family has money.  They would have 
just got out before the fall [unclear].  So he said, that's why the Orlandis are here.  They got our 
family back.   So we're wondering, why are we there?  So he said, he said the reason why now 
we were there, he said, one of the things, he said, I and an awful lot of the other professional 
people that came from Vietnam are concerned about, is the quick homogenization that is 
occurring in your monocultural society and the alienation of kids from their families.  He said, 
we can see that.  He said, when you explained a program, capitalization upon the cultures, and 
the mutual benefits coming from one another, we saw some hope in this.  He said, this is a 
continual concern of ours.  He said, I'll guarantee if you set up that, that you will have more 
professionals coming to live to Lowell because of that.  Because the message that our kids are 
getting in school is denial and disassociation.  And he said we're very, because he said, we have 
some very good aspects of your culture that we want to have maintained, and shared with our 
particular kids.  
D:  Pat, how do you interpret what's going on with the whole educational issue in the city at the 
present time. 
P:  Well I think, number one I think that education, I still believe that your home, and your 
neighborhood and your peers is [unclear] factor in the schools.  There's only about a 20% factor 
as presently organized.  If you come from that factor in the 80%, where the school is a 
continuation of your culture, you'll do all right, you know, in the school.
D:  Yeah, I'm referring specifically to the whole issues about election, the school committee, (P:  
well that's what I mean, yeah, yeah)  I'm sorry, okay.
P:  Well what, what is, what has happened is that you got people, and unfortunately people that 
should know better, that look on the institution of education and look upon that as a 100% factor.
And don't look upon the, what I call the 80% factor.  And so they think that the only thing you 
have to do is to change the personnel of the ones in the 20% factor, and all this education is 
going to occur.  I contend you can take the teachers of Newton Public Schools, and put them in 
Lowell, and put Lowell to Newton, and not much will change with either.  Because, because 
there's not an educator that I know that follows his profession and studies his profession.  Like I 
take the one in Wellesley that we worked very closely with.  He said, there are ten things he said 
I should be doing in the Wellesley Public Schools today, but I can't.  I said, well why can't you?  
He said you can't tinker with a system that people think is successful.  And so he said, these 
things that I knew that improve, I can't bring them in, because people look at our SAT's and say a
percent our our kids are going to college, were doing all right.  He said in my mind we can't do 
anything, because we measure our success by the degree of difference between us and you on 
these SAT scores and the like.  But he said, once you people in the city get off your can and are 
able to bring the improvements we know in education, you're going to come up and exceed us.  
When that happens we're going to do it.  But no progress is going to be made in education 
without it being made in the city, because we can't do it.  So, so what, what I'm saying is they 
have sold this particular thing to the general public, that, that it is not the 80%.  See, I'm claiming
that the 80% factor is an education asset that should be harnessed.  They're saying the 80% part 
is something that has to be changed.  See?  So it's a denial of that.  This is a major difference 
between myself and Tsongas.  I disagree with him and 1000%.  As much as I could disagree with
him.  Because he's talking about bringing culture to the city, this is a further alienation and 
disassociation of the people from their particular background.  Now John Gardner maybe knows 
maybe more about education than anyone.  He's the former Head of Common Cause.  And he's 
the one that Harvard tried to get as President and they couldn't get.  About the 30 years ago, 40 
years ago, he said 50 years from now we'll look back at education as it exist today and wonder 
how it could have been as primitive as it is today.  It's primitive.  And the fact that this belief is 
that the suburbs have the model has stopped the cities from doing the things they were in the 
process of doing.  So now education has been sterilized and institutionalized in this present 
ineffective mode.
D:  So how do you interpret parent's reaction to this, the this [unclear] issue.
P:  Ignorance.  Ignorance.  They don't know, they don't know the full story.  For example, the, the
uh, there's a study done on education.  It was done, a five years study and plan.  The whole 
model came out, the model for the future of education.  
M:  Oh, Lowell Model for Excellence here?  
P:  No.  It's a model done by, under the Environmental Education.
M:  Oh, the Department of Commerce?  Is that the one?
P:  No, that was another one.  This is, it was a whole model that came out, and it came out 
exactly as the model I came up with for learning system, Lowell Learning System.  And what it, 
what it (--)  See, most of your systems you have are instructional systems.  They're not learning 
systems.  There's a hell (--)  And virtually all of them that are in the field of education realize 
that.  But there is a perpetual(--)  See, you can't, you can't change the model of education say, 
from within education itself.  You have to provide a neutral ground where the people could come 
and allow them to kill the particular, the particular model.  So, so this is one of the problems that,
that we have.  Like this is, here, just to give you an example, I met with that group in 
Washington, that there's all the people from the executive and legislative branch that have 
anything to do with education.  And Boyer, Ernest Boyer, when he was Commissioner of 
Education, had me go before that particular group.  They agree 100%, but they say they don't 
know how the hell to change, how to change the schools.  You have the people in Lowell based 
primarily on a lot of bigotry against open enrollment program, who are 100% for parochial 
schools, which are all open enrollment programs and have been for years.  See, the whole 
controversy is on open enrollment.  Supposedly.  But every single parochial school has open 
enrollment.  There is no such thing as a neighborhood school in Lowell, and there hasn't been for
years.  So it's, it doesn't take any brains to be against something.  It takes (--)
M:  So how do you, how do you kind of read this, all this desegregation, anti cental enrollment, 
anti forced busing, all this talk.  I mean what's it all about?
P:  I'd go the other way.  Look it, when you go, when I open the Riley School, now the Riley, this
is 1958.  I went in there as principal, I came from another school as principal.  We, half of our 
kids came from Lower Belvidere.  Half of them came from out of Belvidere.  Teachers and 
parents wanted the kids from Lower Belvidere in one classroom, and the ones from outer 
Belvidere in another classroom.  Now we had no such thing as Hispanics in there.  We only had 
one Black in the whole lower Belvidere.  This was just White against White class.
M:  So do you read this as a class thing?
P:  Positively.  (M:  Not a race thing?)  Now, yes.  And you, you can get uh (--)  And I'll tell you, 
if you want to read something that's really scary, take the whole thing and follow the history of 
Hitler.  It's exactly the same thing.  It's exactly the same tactics.  Follow all of the countries that 
tried to do something, which was suppressive of any group at all, and one of the first step they 
try to do is to get the national language, official language.  
M:  Oh, that stuff, yeah.  
P:  Yeah, and you had(--)  Now the thing is this.  I'd go down another line.  My idea was to get 
Magnet schools in here.  
M:  Well that was the answer to desegregating.  With the Magnet schools, with also was some 
progressive education (--)
P:  But the difference between that and this is, that under the magnet schools there was a theme.  
(M:  Right)  And you had to develop your thing, and the parents had to be a part of that thing, 
and there was a programatic development aspect built into it.  (M:  Right)  Under central 
enrollment there's no programatic element in it, and not the money to do it.  It's just a choice of a 
school.  Like I had people from, a guy by the name of Gerald Smith from Control Data 
Corporation, Minneapolis.  And I was getting that corporation to come in and work with us.  He 
said, before we do anything, he said, we have spent an awful lot of money in education to our 
foundation, but we have found one thing that we have found very very successful.  He said it's 
the Calvert School in Philadelphia.  It's a church related school.  And he said in that everyone in 
that, and we'll call it a magnet school, because you self enroll your kids in there.  Everyone in 
that school, the parents have to agree when they go in there that they will become part of a 
process of the teaching of their on kids.  And the school will teach the process to them, and they 
would be kept.  
SIDE I ENDS
SIDE II BEGINS
LFP-DD-R038
P:  School would teach the process to them, and they would be kept (--)  In other words you start 
harnessing the parents as teachers. He said, we'll come into Lowell, and any money that you're 
not getting from State or Federal we'll provide the other money and we'll have the principal of 
the Calvert School, parent's of the Calvert School, and teachers of the Calvert School come up 
and work.  This is what we're, this is what we're talking about in the ways that some of these 
things can, can be done.  But you're infantile, and asinine thinking that the mechanism of 
education is perfect if the most foolish thing that I could think of.  
M:  And that there's something out there that if we copy that's going to solve all the problems.  
P:  Something that's you want to copy is going to solve your particular problems.  So it isn't that, 
it isn't that at all.  The whole institution of education, most of my education came from living.  
Someone, someone asked Dean Atchinson one time, one of the reporters said, Christ, you seem 
to have a hell of a lot of information.  You know this, you know that, you know everything.  
Where did you get your education?  And he said, most of my education came from my mother's 
knee, and other low joints.  He got it by living.  And he got it by interacting.  Now someone has 
come up with that model, and we could have instituted that model into the city of Lowell.  But 
I'm convinced that it can't  be done in the institution itself form within.  I'm convinced it has to be
done on the neutral ground.  And the thing would be brought in.  That's why I'm going for some 
kind of exploratory, and the like, and I'm going to talk to that guy from the Tsongas Center and 
I'm going to see if (M:  Yeah, Ed Pershey) could bring.  The models have already been, have 
already been developed.  And when this model was developed, and they were willing to try the 
thing out in Lowell, and it was a Regional Model, one for the Merrimack Valley, we wrote up a 
proposal, because I got some money from hardware from the state.  It was something like a 
hundred, two hundred thousand dollars.  That's the amount of money we had.  So we wrote up a 
proposal and sent the thing out.  But I wanted the model instituted, working towards the model, 
working with the institution of that model, which had to have high technology in it.  So we wrote
it up that way.  I knew that Wang wasn't interested in education, because that wasn't their market.
Their market is improved typewriter, you know, office equipment and things like that.  And that's
most of all high technology, that's where they are.  That's where the market is.  So they're not 
looking for anything, a new market like education.  But I went to Prime Computer, and I got 
them interested in the future market, an international market and particularly a third world 
market where they could bring in the learning system.  They got interested in it.  So when we put
out the bids for this thing, and we put this element in, we were asking for the thing, Prime was 
going to put two programs on it, working with this over the years and give us all the equipment 
and work on this particular thing.  Wang objected to it, because it was calling for this particular 
thing.  You know who got the contract?  Wang.  In other words, something for the good of the 
kids of Lowell were sabotaged, because you had an ignoramus like Tsongas.  Wanted to do 
business with, with Wang.  And people don't realize the screwing that they have taken in this 
particular city.  Because they figured, their figuring on it was this, and it may have had some 
validity for some people.  That here was a big international headquarters of Wang in the city of 
Lowell.  How could you give a contract to, to Prime.  My contention was, how can we do the 
best for the kids in the city of Lowell, and Wang could have done it if they wanted to, but it 
wasn't their market, and it wasn't presently the market of Prime either.  But Prime saw it as a 
future market.  Like one of the things, I used to have a working relationship with the uh, with the
what do they call them?  The education development center.  There were regional offices of the 
U.S. Office of Education back years ago that did educational development.  The one in the East 
here was down in Newton.  West Newton.  So I was very very friendly with them.  One of the 
ones that had an affiliation with them was a guy by the name of Dr. Richard Marsden, who 
trained, who had the contract of training most of the people who were going to Africa on the 
Peace Corps.  So, so I got to know him very well through that, and so when they were training, 
got the contract, I said Dick, why don't you do the training in Lowell?  He said, I could he said, if
I could make out arrangements with the University to have the facilities, because we do the 
training in the summertime, starting in June.  So we went up to the University, and Dr. O'Leary 
was there at the time.  It was Lowell State.  And he was asking so damn much for the uh, (M:  to 
rent the dormitories?) to rent the dormitories, that they couldn't do it.  So the next year we 
worked out, we finally worked out a good relationship, and they could come in with their budget,
and they were going to come here.  And one of the things I had in it, that every kid who were in 
the Peace Corp, everyone of the Peace Corp trainees was going to be tied up with one kid in 
Lowell.  And during that period of their training was going to work with that family to see what 
kind of impression that could be made.  So we were due to start in June.  In April, late April, I 
got a call from Dick [unclear] saying it's all off.  I said, why?  He said, he said the, I said I 
thought the program was successful.   He said, oh, we thought the program was successful too.  It
wasn't due to that, but it's the political elements in Africa don't want to see everything that's good
coming in by Whites, and they're beginning to rebel about it.  The political, the political sector.  
Well I said, I kind of agree with them too.  I said, because you don't, you didn't have to do it that 
way.  I said, with the stage of technology now, we could have taken them over here and we could
have developed the chips and everything else.  And we could have developed a learning system 
to put it in.  He and I wanted, he wanted me to go into the business of developing that particular 
thing, because they see it as the future for education in the third world.  You don't have to build 
great big schools like we have around.  There's a lot of different ways of doing that.  But this is 
what, this is where we're going in.  So I think the whole thing is a big discussion over ignorance. 
You know, and, and most of them, part of it is due to a certain amount of, of bigotry, or snobbery,
but also a good part is due to people who happen to be in education, that don't want to change.  
Because, and so they would be, they would be against anything that was going to be bringing 
about, but they wouldn't have the courage to come out outright and say it.  But once you give 
people a vote you can do anything with that vote.  So it's, it's a reflection of a number, a number 
of issues.  Like when I opened the Riley school, and I think I told you, half the kids came from 
Lower Belvidere.  The people, now there were no Blacks involved, and that, it was just a class 
thing.  There were no Hispanics involved in that.  It was just, just a class thing.  But the, but the 
people have been educated in that way on the, the superiority of one group of people, and the 
inferiority of another group of people, and the people they don't know they fear.  And they think 
they're going to depress their thing.  That's the fault of our institutions that have, that have done 
that.  And so we have to, we got a lot of work with to overcome that. 
M:  The thing that seems strange to me is that supposedly there were 13,000 kids riding buses 
last year, and like 13,500 riding buses this year.  And yet all of a sudden, you know, because the 
bus contract was bad, that the whole, it was like every kid being on a bus became in question.  
P:  Well I'll tell you.  The so called sophisticated and rich people in the city have been sending 
their kids out of the city on buses to go on to Notre Dame Academy for a long time.  So it isn't 
the idea, it isn't the idea of busing, it never was the idea of busing.  You had, you had various 
vested interest in ignorance involved in the whole thing.  Like for example, if you had, if you had
a school say in Los Angeles, the most successful schools in the United States, two of them are in 
New York City.  The Bronx School of Science, and the New York School of Performing Arts.  
They're public schools.  Their magnet schools.  You, you get a thematic school and you start 
developing that around a theme, people have some actual choices of where they could go.  And, 
but you've got people that believe that certain schools are successful by what they do.  They're 
not successful by what they do.  They're successful by the virtue of the ones they allow into, into 
the school.  Like I had, when I was principal of the school I used to get kids in the fifth grade that
couldn't read transferred from another school.  So on down it was a parochial school.  I said 
listen, if you're going to get rid of those kids get rid of them in the first or second grade.  Because
I said, no longer am I going to sit back and keep quiet about the way you're getting rid of them in
the fifth and sixth grade, and they can't read.  And because we made progress with them.  The 
fact that we were making progress with them was causing other down there to start pulling their 
kids out.  But you did have, you did have the, that part of it, and the fact that people believe that, 
they were talking from from alters that anyone that was a catholic had to have their kids in the 
catholic school.  And you had people (--)  And where the hell are they doing?  At one time when 
I ran a program in Lowell I had twenty-two nuns on my payroll getting an education so they can 
get a degree, who were already teaching for years.  But the general public doesn't know about 
that, because we had them using other names, I mean used the names on the election list.  [All 
chuckle]
D:  Well this may be a good [unclear] to end this discussion today [unclear], and take it up again.
M:  Yeah, sure.  (P:  Yeah)  Sure.
D:  Thank you very much.
P:  I thought I had one thing here, but I (--)
