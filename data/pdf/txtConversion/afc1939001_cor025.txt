[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax, Port
Aransas, TX]
March 29, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax Port Aransas, Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
The machines and appurtenances should be in your hands by the time this letter reaches
you. But please do not leave Port Aransas until you receive a shipment from Presto. I
ordered discs, cutting needles and playback needles to be sent you direct. Alan promised
to send you instructions for the use of the machine. (It might be advisable for you to write
to the Presto Recording Co., 242 West 55th Street, New York City, giving your itinerary
and asking them to furnish you with a list of recommended “service stations.” They have
agents all over the country.)
Thank you for aiding Dornbusch in this White House party. If successful, it should aid the
entire cause of folk-songs.
Have a nice trip!
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
