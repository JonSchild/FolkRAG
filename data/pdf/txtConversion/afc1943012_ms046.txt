Mr. B.A.Botkin, Division of Music, Library of Congress.
Dear Sir:
On August 1st, it was my privilege to be a judge at the third annual festival and contest of
negro spirituals at Fort Valley, Georgia under the leadershi? pf Willis L. James.
During the festival there was a half hour of broadcast. I was informed that this broadcast
was recorded and the recordings were sent in to you.
I am anxious to receive a set of this material inasmuch as I have never before witnessed
such an outpouring of spontaneous and powerful melody. We need not fear for the vitality
of the negro but because of it if this is a criterion of his native urge and expression.
Will you kindly therefore, let me know concerning these records and I shall appreciate it
very much.
Sincerely, Bliss Wiant Bliss Wiant.
