Dr. Carita Doggett Corse Federal Writers' Project Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Doctor Corse:
I am wondering whether the Library of Congress has furnished either your office or that of
Mr. Black with duplicates of the recordings Messrs. Kennedy, Cook and I made in Tarpon
Springs and of the ones I made independently at Masarycktown and Slovia. If so, is it
possible to obtain the use of them right away? I am turning now to my dissertation and
should like to use certain of the songs to represent the various foreign cultural groupings in
Florida.
I shall appreciate hearing from you at your convenience.
Sincerely yours, ALTON C. MORRIS
P. S. You may be assured that I shall take the very best care possible of the records.
