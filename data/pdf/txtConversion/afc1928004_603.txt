THE GENTLEMEN COONS' 
PICNIC. 
Written by L. 
C. 
BREWS, of the C. N. C. 
Music by JONN CEIINEET, 
As sung with tremendous success in LAW= S
.: Dumvs' great play. 
" 
Muldoon's Boarding-House." 
On, here we are on parade, 
Darkeys light and free ; 
We're off to the G. C. Picnic, 
As you can plainly see. 
We always march in single file 
As the music it does play. 
We're going to have a 
jolly time 
While sailing down the bay. 
CHORUS. 
Then mark time, keep step, 
Forward, march away, 
As the ladies pass we tip our hats, 
While the music it does play. 
Dis colored corps am hard to beat, 
Our tactics are a 
trick, 
We're on our way to spend the day 
At the Gentlemen Coons' Picnic. 
Oh, we'll have lots of music, 
A dance and singing, too, 
-We're bound away for pleasure 
With a 
rattlitig jolly crew. 
Oh, there's the whistle blowing, 
The boat it leaves at six; 
We invite you all to come and go 
To the Gentlemen Coons' Picnic. 
Then mark time, etc.

I'VE BEEN DRINKING TO-DAY. 
PARODY ON " SLAVERY DAYS." 
Written and sung with great success by BILLY NILES of the Carnival 
Novelty Company. 
I'VE been drinking to-day of the slops that's thrown 
away 
From all the vile old beer saloons in the land, 
For they know me as a 
beat and of course they never 
treat, 
So I 
think I'll go and join a 
temperance band. 
I 
had a 
bottle of ram, but they said I 
was a 
bum, 
And locked me up in jail that very night ; 
Oh, they tore us far apart and it nearly broke my heart, 
When I 
saw that bottle disappear from sight. 
CHORUS. 
Those good old days are gone, 
And my clothes 
have to pawn, 
And all my friends have given me the shako ; 
In fact I'm all broke up, and I 
never get a 
sup, 
And I miss that good old question, " What'll you 
take ? " 
Still my memory will steal o'er to that dear old barroom 
floor, 
Where the bums would sit and spit tobacco juice, 
And as on the stove it fell, it would raise an awful smell, 
You would think a 
whole bone factory had broke loose. 
When the bartender would shout, " You bums, I'll fire 
you out I" 
That was a 
signal for us all to get, 
So towards the door we'd pile with a 
sick and ghastly 
For we knew that from the shoulder he did hit. 
Those good old days, etc.

DARLING LITTLE DOT. 
Words by L. C. DREWS. 
Music by Jonx GERNET:T. 
Sung by LAWELL & BREWS in their original sketch entitled " The 
Serenade." 
OH, I've just come out this evening 
To meet my darling Dot, 
She promised she would meet me, 
She lives in yonder cot ; 
The last time that I 
saw my darling, 
She promised she would wed me ; 
She's an angel from above, just like a 
turtle dove, 
And she's won my heart completely. 
Oh, my, site's my belle ! (
Brea/) 
She's the beauty of the dell ; (DreaL) 
I'll be happy when the wedding day is over, 
In that little cottage we- will live so neat ; 
With my darling little wife we will lead a 
happy life, 
Oh, my heart is hers complete. 
Oh, her bright and winning way i3 so tcntrancing, 
Joy and pleasure linger here all thro' the day, 
This earth it seems like heaven, 
Our hearts are always light and gay, 
And when my little Dot is singing, 
Sweet music you will hear. 
Oh you should hear her sing, the melody does ring 
Her YOiC0 so soft and clear. 
Oh, my she's my belle, etc.

SARAH MCGOWN, 
BANJO SOLO. 
Words and music by L. C. Dumws. 
Sung by LAMELL and DnEws, 
IF 
you listen to me, I 
will sing you a 
song, 
About a 
young damsel that lived in this town. 
Her month looks like a 
tunnel, her tongue three yards long, 
And she goes by the name of Sarah McGown. 
Iii tu ral, ii tu ral, etc. 
Now she is the prettiest girl ever was seen, 
Her eyes they are yellow, her hair it is green, 
Her teeth they are freckled, her nose it is sore, 
Oh, I'll never be seen with this girl any more. 
Ri tu ral, ii tu ral, etc. 
I 
took her to a 
party on last Monday night, 
As soon as we got there she wanted to fight, 
I 
told her to keep quiet, or she'd get the boot, 
Then she hauled off and hit me a 
smash in the snoot. 
Ri tu ml, ii tu ral, etc. 
When we went to go home she started to screech, 
Some fellow hit her in the neck with a 
big rotten peach, 
Then her dander was up, and she burst into tears, 
When along came a 
cop, and she got twenty years. 
Rita ral, ii tu ral, etc.

JUST look at my eye, you will see that I'm fly, 
I'm a 
man of influence and great education ; 
I've studied in college, I've a 
great deal of knowledgo 
Of things as off they go every day. 
I 
never play cards, I 
smoke no cigars, 
Unless they are " Henry Clay 
I 
never use slang like the rest of the gang. 
For it would not suit Alderman Fay. 
Alderman Fay, tral-a-lal-la, 
I 
have the ward on my back on election day, 
Alderman Fay, tral-lal-la, 
I'm one of the genuine stock, ha, ha I 
If you get into a 
fight, just keep the thing quiet, 
I 
will go see the judge and make it all right ; 
For I 
have the pull, I 
am like a 
sea- gull, 
I 
am flapping my wings everywhere, 
In Albany, on the committee, 
Of course I 
take command ; 
They come to me, and speak to me, 
And give me a 
shake of the hand. 
Alderman ray, etc. 
Sure President Grant is married to my aunt, 
I'm a 
distant relation to Henry Ward Beecher ; 
I 
wear a 
pin on my breast, it is Tiffany's best, 
It was presented to me t'other day 
By ft committee from Minimally 
To which I 
do belong ; 
The girls all say, I 
carry the sway, 
And they arc mashed on Alderman Pay. 
Alderman Fay, etc. 
MARCHING FOR THE CUP. 
Written by L. C. DnEws. 
Sung by L TVELL S: 
DRETTS. 
OH, we're out upon parade to-day, 
Arrayed in gorgeous style, 
We're marching for the great prize cup, 
It makes us nigs all smile ; 
And when the march is over 
We will all go out to sup ; 
We can't be beat., we walk so neat, 
While marching for the cup. 
CHORUS. 
Hear the music low, away we go; 
Ho, ho, ho 
it's done just so ; 
We march away, we're all so gay 
Come see us drill upon the bill ; 
As we pass by the ladies sigh, 
For we're so fly we'll surely die ; 
'We invite you all, so burry up, 
To see us march for the silver cup. 
We'll give a 
grand reception

FIFTH AVENUE GEORGE. 
As 
sung by DAN IN.EliER, of the Carnival Novelty Company. 
FIFTH avenue George is a 
charmer, 
As all the dear creatures will swear, 
Of fashion I'm always the leader, 
No gent with my style can compare. 
I 
lead an existence of pleasure 
While blessed with a 
fortune -so large, 
And every one gives the opinion 
There's none like Fifth avenue George. 
CHORCS. 
Fifth avenue George, Fifth avenue George, 
Upon me the girls fondly smile, 
For fun and good cheer to the boys I 
am dear, 
I'm the leader of fashion and style. 
I 
wear a 
Knox hat made to order, 
My diamonds will outvie the sun, 
A 
gold-headed cane I 
keep twirling; 
As a 
swell I 
am A Number One. 
I 
can waltz like a 
girl in the ballet, 
And sing like a 
signor from Ileme; 
In every grand parlor or ball room 
Fifth avenue George is at home. 
Fifth avenue George, etc. 
I 
think every business is vulgar, 
I 
can't comprehend the lard times; 
My manner is very romantic, 
And I 
talk about poets and rhymes. 
I 
play philopene with the ladies, 
And flirt with the belles all around ; 
Each day on Broadway promenading 
Fifth avenue George may be found 
Fifth avenue George, etc.

MY JESSIE DEAR. 
Written by L. C. Draws, and sung with great success by LAWELL 
DEZWS of the Carnival Novelty Company, in their original 
sketch entitled, " Serenaders." 
OH, I 
know a 
little dear, she lives right over here, 
Among the flowers blooming in the dell ; 
And she is my beauty bright, also my heart's delight, 
And of our happy tales of love we tell. 
Oh, we wander through the valleys, and up the moutain-
side, 
And there we whisper loving words ; 
In the gentle twilight glow we wander to and fro, 
She's my darling, little, blue-eyed Jessie dear. 
So down in this dell we will ever dwell, 
In a 
little cottage near the brook, 
Sitting with my darling in a 
happy dream, 
As long as life shall brightly glide ; 
'Tis where the scent of roses forever fills th.. 
Will always haunt our years ; 
We will always cling together, my darling one and I, 
My pretty, little, blue-eyed Jessie dear. 
CLOCHETTE. 
SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene,—A cottage.—CmcnETTE engaged setting table, &c.] 
CLocuErrE.—Heigh ho ! I 
wonder if it's true that he is going 
for a 
soldier ? Oh, dear Id cry my eyes out if I 
thought he was. 
What shall I 
do without him? He is the idol of my heart; but I 
don't treat him as if I 
loved him, I 
must confess. 
I 
sometimes 
play all sorts of tricks on him. for he's such a 
goose, I 
know he 
loves me, and that's the reason I 
tease him so. 
Girls always 
act like that. 
Would'ilt it be grand to be a 
soluier though, Oh, 
I 
think I'd like to be one ! 
(Sings.) 
Air:—AMERICAN NATIONAL GUARD. 
Oh bright and gay is the life that I 
love, 
With colors flying free ! 
We dash along and grandly parade, 
Oh, none so proud as we. 
Oar guns we hold in the prettiest line 
To catch the peoples eye: 
With our heads upright and our eyes so bright 
When we go marching by. 
Tramp. tramp. tramp. tramp, 
Right about we go! 
The stars and stripes above, 
So gallantly they flow ! 
Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp. 
On our way, 
The ladies wave their little hands, 
To see our grand array. 
Mark time, march ! In our uniforms so bright, 
The drums and trumpets play, 
And fill us with delight. 
When We Illet•t to march and fight, 
We take the lead, we do indeed.

for! (Coquettishly.) I'm sure I 
don't care though. 
Do, as you 
please. 
ERNEST. (Aside.)—I 
wonder if she's in earnest now? You 
do care something for rue, then ? (Putting arm around her 
waist.) 
CLOCTIETTE. (31-oring away.)-- Keep at a 
respectful distance, 
sir, 
if 
you please. _Remember you are going for a

WHERE THE SWEET MAGNOLIAS BLOOM. 
As performed with great success by the Clipper Trio, M ESSRS. LOWRY, 
NILES & BENNETT, of the Carnival Novelty Company. 
IN 
a 
cosy little cabin down in Georgia, 
Where the cotton-flowers bloom so fair and white, 
There dwells a 
lovely maiden 
Who is my heart's delight ; 
And at night when the little stars were peeping 
And the moon in all her glory shone above, 
I've often talked of happier days 
With this one sweet girl I 
love. 
CHORUS. 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom, (Break.) 
How I 
love their sweet perfume, (Bieak.) 
She was walking thro' a 
shady grove of oranges 
'Neath the calm and silver light of the moon, 
I 
told my darling of my love 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
I 
have wandered far away from sunny Georgia, 
That dear old laud I 
love to call my home, 
Yet oft my dreams.will take me back, 
As thro' the world I 
roam. 
Oh, I 
see the pure white blossoms of the cotton 
As they glisten 'neath the calm and shining moon ; 
That's where I'd like to live and die, 
Where the sweet magnolias bloom. 
Where the sweet, etc.

M Y 
mother-in-law's a 
talker, she's always on the jaw, 
She's talked me out of everything I 
own ; 
She's a 
regular old huffer, the worst I 
ever saw ; 
I 
hope she'll kick the bucket, very soon. 
She's got eyes like a 
mackerel, a 
mouth liku 9, street 
door ; 
She can look two ways, and never squint, 
Oh, she talks and chins all day, till she couldn't talk no 
more ; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
CIIORUS. 
She is luny, she is crazy, 
She can knock the stuffing out of any man, 
She would talk you blind, if you didn't mind, 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
Sometimes she makes it lively and goes for my hair, 
And pulls me all around the room. 
I 
wish she was in heaven, or where she couldn't rare, 
She ought to take a 
trip up to the moon. 
Her tongue goes like a 
clapper, it is loose at both ends, 
She has jawed and talked me nearly blind ; 
She is jawing in the morning, through the day, and 
through the night ; 
Such a 
terrible talker is my mother-in-law. 
She is luny, etc. 
And when she goes to bed, and I 
think she's gone to 
sleep, 
Then she starts again with her old month ; 
I'd like to see her buried, a 
tear I'd never weep ; 
She talks worse than the nigger 7

South, 
A 
talking machine to her, you can'•.,

She's worse than thirty-seven howling bulls ; 
She would talk a 
car conductor out of his fare ;

She is luny. -

Company. 
*
W E'RE two dacent Irish women, 
So now upon us smile, 
We've just been down to market, 
It's just about a 
mile; 
We landed in this city 
Some fourteen years ago, 
We keep an Irish Boarding House 
At forty-nine Dutch Row. 
CHORUS. 
Her name is Mrs. Donahoe, 
And ber's is Mrs. Shank, 
If any of yez want a 
wife, 
We've money in the bank. (
Repeat.) 
Oh, now we must be going, 
It's nearly dinner time ; 
Come to our house and get a 
meal, 
It will cost you but a 
dime. 
We set a 
first-class table, 
With everything so neat, 
We'll give you everything so nice, 
The grub it can't be beat. 
Her name is Mrs. Donahoe, etc. 
BEAUTIFUL BEWILDERING FLOWER. 
Written by L. C. Thaws, and snug by LAWELL and Ditzwa. 
W HILE strolling on the avenue to-day, 
I 
met such a 
pretty girl, 
Her face as bright as any day in May; 
It put my heart in quite a 
twirl. 
There is none such beauty can disclose, 
When she wakes from blissful dreams at early dawn, 
And the pride of all flowers is the rose, 
She's my beautiful bewildering flower. 
As we walked along together going home, 
My happiness did then and there increase ; 
Our hearts from each other never roam, 
We are happy as the summer morning's breeze. 
Oh, the time when we will happy be, 
Is not far away you bet, 
For she a 
little wife will be to me, 
Oh, how I 
bless the day that e'er we met. 
3 
met her first, 'twas in a 
summer bower, 
And I 
shall not forget her pleasing smile ; 
I 
would have claimed her then, had I 
the power 
Oh, my heart she did beguile. 
Then I 
asked her to be mine forever more, 
There came an answer, loving, kind and true, 
As we walked arm and arm through the door, 
She said to me, I 
always will be true.

How enchanting to be wandering beneath a

To listen to the streamlet as it murmurs sweetly by, 
And. to hear the little birdies singing ever merrily ; 
In such a

Teeth of pearly whiteness, too, 
She's the fairest of the fair. 
Oh, we wand,•red on together, as the moon in beauty 
shone, 
The little stars wer.e twinkling bright as we were all 
alone, 
A question soft I asked her, as her eyes looked into 
mine, 
Her sweet reply I'll ne'vr forget, she answered, "I 
am 
thine."

The lobster got angry and started to cry, 
When a 
speckled old hen came along that way, 
And hearing the clatter said, " What (rye say ? " 
Now when Mr. Horsefly saw -speckled Miss Hen 
Talking in such a 
rude manner to them, 
He got on his ear and started to kick, 
When the lobster and bullfrog took very sick.

He kicked out the frog which the old hen ate ; 
Oh, he kicked at the lobster with all his might, 
Then he kicked himself clear out of sight.

She had money, and I 
had none, 
So to court her I 
begrm. 
I 
went to see her one rainy night, 
And with the rain was drenched thro' quite ; 
But the cruel butcher he 
Cut in there, and cut out me. 
To gain this point, he gave a 
ball, 
And I 
was asked with the neighbors all ; 
I 
asked her hand, I 
do declare, 
But she gave me her foot, and I 
won't tell where. 
I 
went again my suit to press, 
And what I 
saw you'll never guess ; 
When I 
got in there, I 
did see 
That she was frying sausages for he. 
Now one kiss before we part, 
For you have broke this faithful heart ; 
Scarcely these words I 
had said, 
When she up with the skillet and broke my head. 
Now all you who for love are sighing, 
Never go courting where sausages are frying, 
Lest like me you feel the weight 
Of the frying pan upon your pate. 
THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER. 
SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS.—MALE 
FEMALE. 
Seene,—An old fashioned room. 
Chair by fire side. cte. 
(Symphony of song is played as Jenny enters.) 
JENNY.—No 
news yet of harry. 
Oh, if this horrible suspense 
was over. 
It seems as if the sunshine had left the sky now he 
is away. 
Only he is left to me out of all our once happy 'house-
hold. 
There is the old wooden rocker that Grandma used to sit 
in and tell us stories when we were children. 
How I 
love it! 
What memories it summons up ! Gone is the happy-hearted old 
man that day after day slumbered there and morning noon and 
night made the lions," ring with his merry laulter.

THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER.—Concluded. 
That was the song harry used to sing in the long ago. 
Would he were here now to join me in the chorus as in the olden 
days. 
[HARRY. Looking in at window.] 
HARRY.— (Aside.)—I 
must not startle her. 
She has not 
heard of my coming home. 
JENNY.—NO news of Harry. 
I 
am sick at heart. 
[HArtnv, Sings 2d verse of song.]

If this chair could but speak, oh! the tales it could tell,— 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell: 
'Neath the stars and the stripes he fought bravely mid true, 
lie cherished his freedom, the red white, and blue ! 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall. 
[JENNY, _
Listens joy/id/y.] 
JENNY.—' Tis he ! I 
would know his voice among a 
thousand. 
HARRY! 
[Enter HARRY.] 
HARRY. —Jenny, dear Jenny! (They embrace.) 
JENNY. —Oh, Harry, back again safe and sound. 
How happy 
I 
am ! But how you startled me. I 
had almost given up all 
hope of seeing you again. 
IlAnnv.—Did you not get my letter? 
JENNY.—Letter ? No. 
HARI:v.—That's just my luck. 
No matter, so long as I 
am 
here at last. 
Oh, how I 
have sighted to see the old homestead 
once more! In the camp, on the march, everywhere your face 
htts gone with me, and I 
have thought by day, and dreamed by 
night of the old song we used to sing. 
Sing it Jenny, and it 
will recall the happy past.

But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done,— 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one, 
They have all gone to meet her •• in the sweet by-and-bye." 
And all that is left is dear sister and I. 
Never more will we hide her gold spec's. or her cap; 
Never more will we tease her while takir her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair gyiin and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall.

I'VE a 
casket at home that is filled with precious gems 
I 
have pictures of friends dear to me, 
And I've trinkets so rare, that came many years ago, 
From my far distant home across the sea. 
But there's one sweet little treasure that I'll ever dearly 
prize, 
Better far than all the wealth beneath the wave ; 
Tho' a 
small faded flow'ret, that I 
placed in childhood's 
days. 
"Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Treasured in my mem'ry like a 
happy dream, 
Are the loving words she gave, 
And my heart fondly cleaves to the dry and withered 
leaves— 
'Tis a 
flower from my angel mother's grave. 
In the quiet country churchyard they laid her down to 
sleep ; 
Close beside the old home she's at rest, 
And the low, sacred mound is enshrined within my heart, 
By the sweet ties of love forever blest. 
In the still and silent night I 
often dream of home again, 
And the vision ever tells me to be brave; 
For the last link that binds me to the - place I 
love so 
well, 
Is the flower from my angel mother's grave. 
Treasured in my memory, etc.

Two colored swells of high degree 
Stand before you now, 
We promenade the avenue 
And to the ladies bow ; 
We dress in latest fashion, 
The girls do all admire, 
We are the governor's dandy sons, 
There isn't any flyer. 
CHORUS. 
Lardy dar! 
All, ha, ha I 
Tra, la, la.! 
Ab, ha, ha! 
The ladies say that we are gay 
As we walk through the park. 
Pants so neat, ah, ha, ha ! 
Such little feet! ah, ha, ha! 
Oh, we're the swells that catch the belles— 
The governor's dandy sons. 
And when we take our morning walk 
Upon the avenue, 
To the ladies sweet we always talk 
And skip the tra la loo. 
We smile upon each darling 
And tip our hats just so ; 
We have money by the millions, 
And of course no bills we owe.

AM thinking to-day 
Of dein years dat passed away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
In old Virginny State, 
It was dar we separate, 
And it fill'd my heart with misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy,

From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
dey put us far apart, 
An' it broke de ole man's heart, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days.

Dey never come again, 
Let us give our praise to Him 
Who looks down whar de little children play 
So ev'ry night and morn, 
We will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dent agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er 
To dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night, when all was dark, 
We would hear de Ivatch-dog bark, 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, 
" 
You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd I 
For then we Nvould weep and moan, 
For our souls was not our own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days. 
Dey never, etc. 
'

And our life am nearly done; 
I 
have travell'd in the roughest kind of road ; 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, 
I 
have reach'd de end at last, 
And I'm resting by de wayside wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive, 
has always been my guide, 
For dat's what de golden Scripture surely says;

But our mem'ry will turn round, 
When our souls dey were tied down, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days.

IN 
Scotland's fair land, o'er mountains and rills, 
That's where I 
roamed for many a 
day, 
In looking at the lads and lassies on the green, 
In the fair old land of Scotland far away. 
I 
have waited for her coming, but she has not come as 
yet ; 
The truth seems to dawn upon me plain ; 
They say she is false, but I 
still believe her true— 
She's my darling blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
CIIORUS. 
Oh Jean, my bonnie Jean, come to your laddie once 
again ! 
They say you are false, but I 
still believe you mine, 
You are my bonnie blue-eyed Scotch lassie, Jean. 
She said she would meet me, but I've waited long in 
vain— 
In lands far away she does roam ; 
Her promise she will keep; oh ! break it not, my Jean ; 
We'll be happy in our bonnie little home. 
Oh ! then let me not long wait, let me meet thee soon, my 
Jean, 
And the heavens will smile on our love, 
And when life is dead, we will leave this earthly scene, 
And our hearts will dwell in joy and bliss above. 
Oh I 
Jean, my bonnie Jean, etc.

She has given unto you, 
So remember when you greet her, 
Keep a

She is all this world to you, 
There can never be another 
Heart so loving and so true_ 
Always keep a 
smile for mother, 
It will cheer her loving heart, 
It will bring again the sunshine 
To the years that now depart. 
Youth and summer-time, sweet roses, 
They have faded from her view, 
just to bring them back to cheer her,

Dows in good old Alabama is de place whar I

Oh ! dar's whar I

I

horn, 
Bat, alas ! dem good old times am passed away. 
Oh ! I 
want to see my cabin home I 
left so long ago, 
It's de clearest spot to me in all de land ; 
Oh ! I 
long to hear de coons playing on de old banjo, 
Dat is why I'm travelling back to Alabam. 
CHORUS. 
All de children used to sing in de evening on de green, 
It used to sound so lovely and so grand; 
Oh ! it tilled my heart with joy, how sweet it used to 
seem, 
Dat is why I'm travelling back to Alabam. 
Dear old massa's dead and gone, and I 
will neber see him 
more, 
What a 
good old old soul he was to uncle Cuff; 
He has left dis world ob pain, up to glory he has gone, 
And ob trouble, dis old man has had enough. 
So I'se travelling back to Alabam, I 
want to get dar soon, 
But I 
fear de place am lonely and forlorn, 
So I 
bid you all good-bye, wid a 
tear-drop in my eye, 
For de time am come, de ole man must be gone. 
All do children, etc. 
SOMETHING OF A WRESTLER. 
Written by H. 
BENNETT, and sung by BILLY NILES of the Carnival 
Novelty Company. 
0, I'M something of a 
wrestler, I 
often take it in, 
Whenever there's a 
boxing match I 
ante up my tin. 
I'm something of a 
sporting man, I 
like to make a 
bet, 
I 
stand a 
chance of losing, but I 
never done it yet. 
A 
little bit of pleasantry occurred the other night, 
I 
went to see a 
wrestle and it ended in a 
fight, 
A 
Scotchman, a 
Dutchman, a 
Turk, and a 
Mick, 
And poor Johnny Riley got slugged with a 
brick. 
CHORUS. 
Then nobody knows what a 
racket there was there, 
Nobody knows now, I 
tell you, I 
declare. (Repeat chorus.) 
Now the cause of all the trouble, I 
could never keep it 
mum, 
Somebody called Johnny McIntire a 
bum; 
Johnny got up and he struck out his hand, 
And he swore he could lick any cripple in the land. 
Big John Monohan was standing by the door, 
He caught a 
hold of McIntire and threw him on the 
floor; 
He went for little Brady, and he hit him such a 
crack 
That he knocked his Sunday shirt clean off of his back. 
Then nobody knows, etc.

Oh, hear him calling now ! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, sadly the cuckoo is calling now, 
I 
hear him far up in the ruins so gray ; 
And softly the moonbeams are falling now, 
O'er shunbeiing blossoms of May. 
Soft lilies and the rose 
Wave in the valleys green, 
Sad spirts yearn for their lost love, 
While beautiful shamrock grows. 
Oh, sadly the. cuckoo, etc. 
The birds do sing with a 
merry trill, 
Their glad notes sound clear through the woodland 
bowers, 
But the cuckoo's song is so sad and still, 
It comes in the twilight's lone hours.

Oh, k,adly the caekoo i, calling now,

As sang with great success at HenameN and Hear's Theatre Comique, 
514 Broadway, 
Y. 
On, the rose of Kentucky and me, 
Long ago old massa set us free ; 
I'll tell you what did happen in her good old mother's 
cabin, 
To the rose of Kentucky and me. 
On the banks of the Ohio River, 
Where the winters are so cold the darkeys shiver. 
One night about eight we joined the married state, 
ThSrose of Kentucky and me. 
CFIOnUs. 
On the banks of the river, that old muddy river, 
She lived Oil the banks of the river ; 
And one night about eight, we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
When they tri-a to win my Ilose away from me, 
My wife alone she said she'd he; 
-Yet their vanity she nattered, and their hearts she always 
shattered, 
When they tried to play that game on me. you see. 
Her voice tilled this darkey full of glee, 
She's as merry and as bro:y as a bee. 
I 
love when I look at her, she's black, but that's no 
matter, 
She's just the shade I'd have my darling be. 
On the banks of the river, etc. 
Since I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife, 
We have lived togetivr tree from care or strife ; 
And it's natural to suppose, we had a 
little Rose, 
For so sweetly flowed the' saintlier of our lime.

I LOVE YOU. 
Sublime Rhyme and Chime.— By W M. H. 
DaumAwn% 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
AVhen the silver moon was shining, 
And the little stars were twinkling, 
All in the month of June, 
I 
ehaneed to meet a 
beauty, 
So sylph- like, neat and pretty, 
With pouting lips like ruby__ 
Beach blossoms in full bloom, 
And as she came tip nearer, 
Her sweet face full in view. 
My heart spake like a 
whisper, 
Fair maiden I 
love you. 
CH011us. 
Oh ? yes, yes, yes, she's all the Avorlil to me. 
No, no. no, there's none so fair as she, 
Her bright blue eyes bet wiching. 
Had pierced me thro' and thro', 
My heart still breathes as whisper, 
Fair maiden I 
love you. 
Tho' strange it may be seeming, 
Her face is ever beaming. 
A starlight in my dreaming, 
A daisy dipped in dew, 
Ali ! could my arms perliewher, 
I 
lik e a dove \you'd coo her, 
And wed as well its woo her. 
This maiden fair and true; 
And all the won :1 
might envy, 
And wislt me ill to do. 
But I 
would still be happy. 
Fair maiden, but with you. 
Oh! yes, yes, yes, Ste. 
Alt here I 
have a 
letter, 
What could please me better, 
Now, ‘vho can be the writer, 
That hand i 
never knew, 
It says, dear friend, excuse me, 
If as a 
friend I 
choose thee. 
To meet me, don't refuse me. 
This course I 
must pursue; 
I 
can no longer tarry. 
Since first my eyes met you, 
Now, it you wish to marry. 
fluid me good aud true. 
Oh ! yes, yes, yes, ece. 
Written and sung by LAIVELL and DILEWS. 
OH, down in yon silvery glen, 
Near the gentle running stream, 
Among those flowers blooming sweet, 
I 
wander there to dream. 
My darling loved one dwells within 
An ivy covered cottage near the brook; 
Her voice is full of melody, 
Her eyes a 
tender look. 
CHORES. 
She has promised for to meet me here, 
She has won my heart completely, 
We will play the banjo and guitar, 
And blend our voices sweetly. 
(
Repeat.) 
It's time that she was meeting me, 
She said she'd come at eight, 
And meet me underneath that tree, 
As the birds sing to their mate. 
My darling all proclaim so fair, 
A 
fragrant blooming flower, 
She has promised to wed me, I 
declare, 
'Mid Cupid's shining bower. 
She has promised, etc. 
OLD FOT.WS AT H OME. 
Way down upon the Swanee ribber, 
Far, far away, 
Dare's wha my heart is turning ebbe; 
Dere's wha de old folks stay. 
All up and down de who7e creation, 
Sadly I 
roam ; 
Still longing for de old plantation 
And for de old folks at home. 
CHORUS. 
All de world am sad and dreary, 
Ebry where I 
roam; 
Oh I 
darkeys, how my heart grows woe le , 
Far from de old folks at home. 
AB around de little farm T 
wandered, 
When I 
was young; 
Den many happy days I 
squandered, 
Many de songs I 
sung. 
When I 
was playing wid my bratider, 
Happy was I; 
Oh I 
take me to my kind old mudder, 
Dere let me live and die. 
1411 de.. wont, 
One little hut among cla bushes, 
One dat I 
love; 
Still sadly to my memory rushes, 
No matter where I 
rove,. 
When will I 
see de bees a 
humming, 
All round de comb ? 
When will I 
hear de banjo tumming, 
Down in my god home.

SillIg by Tom NVAnriELD4 
I'31 floating along on de wings of peace, 
I 
feel just as slippery as axle grease; 
Go tell Ulysses to fetch along Saul, 
There's lots of room for the short and tall. 
We'll pass you in, it won't cost a 
cent, 
No landlord around to collect the rent ; 
It's free to all to examine de ground, 
Don't dodge de hat when it's passed around. 
CHOIMS. 
Come, join de huckleberry picnic, 
It's going to take place to- day ; 
I'se on de commit tee to invite you all. 
I 
ain't got long to stay. 
The wicked stands in a 
slippery place, 
A 
good man always holds an ace ; 
If you cross the river put on your gown, 
Swim like a 
fish and you'll surely drown. 
A 
policeman's like a 
wicked sin, 
If you don't look out he'll swoop you in ; 
Denounce dishonesty of every sort, 
But steal like an artist, don't get caught.

HOW THE BANJO WAS INVENTED. 
A BECITATION. 
By lawzrz and Dva:ws. 
OH, have you never heard ? 
How banjos were invented, 
It is the strangest story, 
But to me it was presented. 
Of the ' possum's tail I'm going to tell, 
And I 
want you all to listen, 
About de hair dat isn't dere, 
And why de hair is missin'. 
It's about old Noah and the ark, 
That I'm about to tell you, 
And about that ham, his big black son, 
And about the snakes and 'possums. 
He had a 
batting billygoat, 
And a 
hundred head of cattle, 
Ile drove em 'board the ark as 80011 .S 
He heard the thunder rattle. 
De ark she kep a 
sailin'. 
And a 
sailin', and a 
sailiu' ; 
De lion got his dander up, 
And like to break de palm'. 
De sarpints hissed, de painters yelled, 
Till what with all de fussin', 
You couldn't hardly hear de mate; 
A 
bossin' round and cussin'. 
7,-,7.1w Ham, de only Iiigger 
Dat was rtinning on (
1,. packet, 
Got lonesome in de barber shop, 
And couldn't stand de racket. 
And so for to amuse hisself, 
He steamed some wood and bent it, 
And soon he had a 
banjo made, 
De fast dat was invented. 
He wet de leather, stretched it on, 
Made bridge, and screws and apron, 
And fitted in a 
proper neck, 
'Twas very long and taperin'. 
He took some tin and twisted him, 
A 
thimble for to ring it, 
And den de mighty question rose, 
How was he gwine to string it ? 
De possum had as fine a 
tail 
As de one dat is'e a 
singing ; 
De hairs so long, and thick and strong, 
D,%y's 1i 
for banjo stringing. 
Dat nigger shaved 'em off as close 
As wash day dinner graces, 
And sorted of 'em, by de size 
From little E's to basses. 
He strung her, tuned her, struck a 
jig, 
'Twas nebber mind de wedder ; 
They sound like forty leven bands, 
Playing all together. 
Some went to pattire, sonic to dancin', 
Noah c.filAl de figures, 
And this 
this is bow the banjo was 
Invented by the niggerN

OH, 
FRED, 
TELL THEM TO STOP! 
Sung by SOT. & Mil RUSSELL. 
No doubt you have heard of the great Fancy Fair 
That used to take place ev'ry day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there, 
To pass a 
dull hour away. 
We went in, you must know, and saw Richardson's show, 
And Wombwell's Menagerie as well; 
There were roundabouts, swings, and all kinds of things, 
Forget the (lay I 
never shall. 
SPOKEN. — rps, when we got into the Pair my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride on one of the roundabouts. I 
said, 
"All right, my darling," and we had a 
swine. • but di-

and 
fro she lustily call-C(1 ont—

" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop I" 
that was the cr'y of 
-
Maria ; 
But the more she said " We)," they said "Let it go," 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
The people that stood round, of course they all latigli'd, 
But I 
only said, • 4 Stop the swing." 
There were four or five others in the boats besides us, 
Saying, " Master, don't do such a 
thing." 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knee, 
And one of them said, " The young man's turning red, 
But isn't lie having a 
spree." 
" 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop," etc. 
They soon stopped the swing, and Maria got out, 
And quickly f,-,
11 down On the 11 ; 
They brought her some water, which WW1 brought her 
to—

now do adore.
