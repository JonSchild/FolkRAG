sandwich shop, but we made everything from scratch." Getting into the 
local chef culture via the Commonwealth job.

benefits of this sort of pay for someone under twenty working in the industry; "seduced me 
into the kitchen culture." Got $5oo/week cash, at Commonwealth.

pirate ship"; discusses bonding amongst other employees and 
becoming best friends; smoking and making sandwiches; "one of the funnest kitchen jobs I 
had."

■ "Young Chef Extraordinaire": Working with his ego as a 
early scratch chef; "I 
thought I 
was 
some big chef, but I 
was not. I 
could run a 
sandwich shop. But I 
was fast"; revisions to this 
idea once he got more experience

etc.; avoiding the corporate kitchen scene where most ingredients are from Sysco, etc.

the menu and fiasco over the much-lauded and never-happened opening of the "White 
Rabbit" restaurant; scandal in the Columbus food/chef community

■ Leaving Commonwealth Sandwich Shop and applying to "high end" restaurants; getting a 
new job at Sage -- hired as a

wasn't; I 
was just a 
guy who made sandwiches"; starting to make a 
name in the Columbus

marketing; great references

prep on the table next to the dish machine

carrying out the requirements of the dish pit job

4552 
-- Next Steps: Working at Alana's Fine Dining // Culture at Alana's 
■ Jack calls Alana's " still, to this day, the best-sourced restaurant I've ever worked in, by design"; 
describes its history and stature (open almost 20 years; "consistently a 
top ten restaurant"; 
menu different every day) 
■ Considered Alana's "where I 
learned to be a 
good line cook"; moved, for the first time, 
beyond prep and pantry work 
■ Narrative on how he got the job -- approached Alana; was taken on as an apprentice; 
discussion on how chefs look for "green" line cooks, to be able to teach them how to do 
things their way 
■ Culture at Alana's; adjusting to a 
new menu every day and cooking in a 
small kitchen; 
interactions with co-chefs; description of life and work behind-the-scenes 
■ Discussion of entremet station and the French kitchen organization system -- what stations 
cook/prepare what. Entremet prepares "what goes with ... whatever the real guy's cooking"; 
4 
"classic French brigade set-up" model -- entremet; mise; Poisson. `
Almost all kitchens are 
somewhat a 
play on the French brigade system." 
5328 -- Moving on fromAlana's // Heading to the Farms 
■ Jack describes his decision, after two years, to leave Alana's to seek out work/training on an 
organic farm; influenced by his interest in good sourcing 
■ Describes his process of seeking out an apprenticeship; and ending up at Devon Point Farms 
in Connecticut, on a 
farm known for milking Devons, now a 
heritage breed -- "they all have 
big horns, too; even the ladies!" 
■ Spending time working with apples; and working in the barn, restoring a 
cider press 
■ Drawn to the farm for a 
culture; sought out time and experience with a 
more conservative 
farming family different from the "hippie-dippie organic" culture he was already familiar 
with. Wanted to put himself out of his comfort zone; to experience another sort of politics --
"these are the people who grow the majority of our food ... that's what I 
wanted to learn." 
■ Reluctance of the farm to hire Jack at first -- most interns are from Cornell or other ag 
schools; " I'm ... a 
line cook, with a 
naked girl on my arm." 
■ Benefits of being able to know/speak farmer lingo; and to connect with farmers who come in 
to supply his restaurants; importance of taking a 
break from chef culture and being outside; 
new goals, post-Devon Point, may include opening a 
farm/restaurant before he is thirty

massive heirloom 
bean collection

job 
■ Watershed Distillery Kitchen: chef, two sous-chefs; "one of the first distilleries to have a 
restaurant attached to it in the state"; high-end restaurant w/ tasting menu 
■ Creating a 
fun kitchen culture and maintaining cooks; developing leadership culture in the 
kitchen as a 
sous-chef; "double-edged sword" of being friends with your cooks/staff, but also
