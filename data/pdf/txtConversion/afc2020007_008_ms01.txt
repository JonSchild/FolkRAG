Ellen Kendrick:…Awkward. Have you done much zooming? 
Austin Daniel: I haven't had to do much zooming.  
EK: Oh  
Samuel Kendrick: You are a lucky man.  
EK: Yes you are. This is May 6, 2:01 and we're talking to Austin Daniel and Austin lives in New 
Jersey. So what we told her [reference to Emily Daniel] is we’re doing a series of interviews for a 
fellowship that we were awarded. It's called The Archie Green Fellowship, and it's a folk studies 
deal that is through the Library of Congress. And it's like a big deal. Sam graduated in May from 
Western Kentucky, in his profession it's like the best thing you can get. I've been teaching art for 
30 years at Fort Scott, High School. Quit last year, just in the nick of time because of the pandemic. 
I think. And we've always… I wanted to do a photo study like a photo project on the Ag Pilots that 
we know. And then we decided just to combine our interests and do interviews and photos and do 
it through this Archie Green, which we got. So, it's kind of a big deal. The interviews, all of them 
that we do, yours included, will be archived forever at the Library of Congress in Washington DC. 
They'll be made available to researchers, anybody's who's interested in the profession. And so 
that's what this is about. So, we actually also work with my other son. Sam is my son, obviously. He 
has an older brother and he has been our point of contact. He is learning to fly from one of the 
pilots we've interviewed and… Yeah, he's not around right now but he's like, the technical geek. So 
I was kind of hoping he'd be back in time to talk to you because I knew you guys could get into 
some technicalities that I’m completely stupid about. So he may show up but he may not, too. So 
Sam doesn't do a lot of the talking he makes me do the talking. Well I've been talking to people 
over 30 years anyway. Thanks for doing this. It's yeah. It's kind of a neat thing. What is your… Oh, 
your shirt says the  NAAA?  
AD: Yeah, it's a NAAA shirt. We go, you know, every… Emily, I'm sure probably touched like quite a 
bit but we go every year to the National Convention that the NAAA holds and, you know, one of the 
most important parts is getting your t-shirts and jackets and hats and everything else. It’s where I 
do my shopping for the year. 
EK: Absolutely. Your new wardrobe. 
AD: That's right, yeah. [laughter] 
EK: Did they have it last year or did they do it virtual? 
AD: No, they did it last year in Savannah. The city of Savannah was very accommodating, you 
know, given the circumstances. And so it was… The attendance count was down pretty 
considerably but all of the fundraising aspects of the of the convention, which is really, you know, 
one of the most important parts, was actually pretty even keel. As far as… You know, we have an 
auction that raises a lot of money and so there was pretty good at attendance at the fundraising 
type events. We’re actually going to go back to Savannah again this year. Yeah, so… 
EK: We met a guy, or we talked to a guy, Sam Styron, lives in Harrisonville, Missouri. I guess he's… 
He attends so do you know him? 
AD: I've met him I don't know him very well, but… Pretty… It's a pretty small group, you know, 
really when you think about it. Yeah, between the you know the few Facebook pages and the 
associations around the around the country, it doesn't take long to get to know people at least by 
name, you know. 
EK: I kind of think of it as a large knitting club actually. [laughter] Some of these guys are pretty 
gossipy too.  
AD: It can get a little gossipy. [laughter]  
[00:05:00] 
AD: That’s what happens. You know when it's… You know there's only so much ground out there. 
It seems like there’s a lot of it, but… 
EK: I think it's… It gets kind of competitive. They all say it's not competitive around here, but I 
think they're lying.  
AD: I think, rightfully so, I think it's competitive everywhere which, you know from my point of 
view, I think competition is excellent. I think, you know, the lack of competition is what causes 
stagnation in, you know, certain marketplaces. And so even in a, you know, the little small world 
we're in, in New Jersey, we have competition and it's significant competition. You know, Mike, but 
our company and our competitors are, you know, pretty much toe to toe all the time. Which is 
great for the farmers because it it makes us, you know, try harder and keep our prices competitive 
and, and do a better job. I think that's… I think it's really important. I think it's good. 
EK: These guys were mostly talking about young upstarts coming in from the south. And these 
with these guys were, you know, they were in their 50s and they were like these young kids come 
in and you know… These crazy kids…  
AD: Well, yeah, it's… There's more young people in this now than there were, you know, probably 
10 or 15 years ago and it's kind of the same situation that the airlines had. There seems to be… 
everything in aviation for the most part, kind of seems to follow whatever track the airlines are on 
so… [crosstalk, unintelligible]. So as far as… I guess, as far as people getting into the industry and 
the flow, the typical flow from your time building jobs, up to... You know, a lot of people look at, 
you know, being a pilot for a major airline as kind of the end goal. You know, not everybody. But 
what does seem to happen is when the airlines were what we would call kind of like top-heavy 
where they had a lot of people pushing retirement and so they had a, for a long period of time they 
weren't doing very much hiring at all, and up until just recently, they, you know, their hiring was 
for the most part on hold, then they had a, pretty large amount of retirements all at once, and they 
had to hire a lot of younger people into the industry for, you know. I don’t know if it's coincidental 
necessarily or not, but it seems like the Ag Industry kind of followed the same path. Where there 
were… There was a lot of experience and there weren't necessarily a large amount of young 
people trying to get started in the industry until I mean I've noticed in probably the last eight to 
ten years mostly due… I think, because due to how many retirements there are. Now, there's more 
opportunities for young people to get into the industry. But there’s definitely a push right now of 
young, you know, younger people trying to break it into the industry. I'd say, we probably, I 
probably interview 15 people a year that are interested in learning to fly, you know, through our 
company and get a first seat with us. So… 
EK: You and Emily are the youngest people we've talked to.  
AD: I believe it, yeah. 
EK: She's 27 that's like… I mean, she's a child…[laughter] mostly it’s 50-year-old men, you know? 
AD: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. We're definitely a very young company, aside from… So, you know, it's my 
dad's business. Emily and I are in the process of, you know, doing the passing down of the 
business and… It’s a massive financial hurdle trying to figure out… just a logistical hurdle, trying to 
figure out how to actually take over a business, you know, from your family, and he started the 
business when I was a little kid. So, but yeah, he's pretty much retired. He still does do some flying 
here and there, but my wife and I are running the company. I'm the oldest at 29, Emily is 27…  
[00:10:00] 
AD: …our second year pilot Dan is 26, going on 27, and then our youngest pilot, Matt is finishing 
up his commercial, now. He'll probably be getting started towards the end of this year doing some 
dry work. He's only, he'll be 19 when he starts lab. And what's that? 
EK: Just a baby?  
AD: Oh, yeah! Yeah, I was 18 when I started obviously I was, you know, really, really fortunate to 
have, you know, grown up in it. And that's the situation a lot of times people end up growing up in 
it and get involved very young but yeah, that's you know, I look at it as there's just that many more 
years ahead of us, you know as opportunity and it's definitely being noticed. I think there are quite 
a few operators that look at it as you know, there's… now there's more pilots and more operators 
and there's only so many acres and you know, maybe some of my work’s going to get taken away. 
There's also other operators, it look at it as you know, hey now we have our exit plan. You know, 
we're going to have to retire some day. The main concern is that a lot of operators are worried, 
who is going to take care of their customers when they, you know… They can't do it forever, so… 
And we've been making a lot of progress, kind of lining up things for the short term, the long term. 
Just to make sure that the work, you know, is able to get done.  
EK: Yeah, a couple of these guys that we talked to mentioned a guy named Sam Dyer, who… he 
was… He's just, you know… and that's like… central Missouri, mid-central Missouri and he was 
like, this old guy who got them started, you know. I don't even know if he's still alive anymore, but 
they were… I mean, it seems like a lot of these guys do it… Like, They'll go into the corporate world 
and then they're just not happy, you know, they've always loved to fly and they're not happy. So 
they decided this is what they're going to do. And so a couple of them had a very similar story that 
this old guy just, you know, taught him how to fly and said, get ready because I'm going to retire. 
So, they stepped in. But you seem a little more systematic about it. 
AD: We definitely are. I have a background… I flew for the regional Airlines for a year and kind of 
same situation. I didn't enjoy that very much and this is, you know, I started flying… spraying for 
my dad when I was, you know, soon as I got my commercial license and I had obviously grown up 
growing up around the airplanes, long before that. So, when I got out of high school, I joined the 
Air National Guard and I became a crew chief in the guard unit that's here in New Jersey, on 
fighters. So, I got a pretty, you know, a pretty good foundation from being a crew chief for kind of 
how I want it to make things structured on kind of the maintenance side, which is obviously, you 
know, for what we do being below 500 feet most of the day, maintenance is really, really 
important. And then I flew for the Regionals got, you know, a little more exposure to, you know, 
the structure flying for the Airlines and then the real, you know, kind of kick into gear is… I got 
hired to fly the F16 in the Guard unit that I was in. I went to Pilot training… So from flying in a 
Fighter Squadron for, you know, several years, I got to take more elements of that structure, you 
know, standard… Standardization, training syllabus, a lot of elements that really you know, not 
that they never did but they weren't… they were never enforced on our industry. Which is good to 
a certain extent because we like to handle things, you know, ourselves not have necessarily the 
government make our decisions for us but, you know, my wife and I made a really conscious 
decision that we were going to bring as much structure to the business as we can. 
[00:15:00] 
AD: Where it makes sense for safety and longevity. I look at it to… that in our area of the country, 
there's a lot of congestion which you know, we have to work around. There's some terrain, there's 
lots of obstacles and the fields that we spray are not your typical Midwestern big, open fields. 
They're very technical, and on top of that, a lot of the work that we do is specialty, crop work, you 
know, high yield fruits with cranberries and blueberries, is what we do a lot of. And so, it's really, 
really, really important that we do a very thorough job with our coverage, you know, during our 
applications. So all that being said, we we've taken a kind of a much more forward-thinking 
approach to how we go through our hiring process, who we select. We've got two mechanics here 
that were that were also mechanics in the military. I like incorporating as much structure as we 
can moving forward because it's just, you know, a foundation to build off of really. 
                  
EK: How do you spray a cranberry bog or blueberries? I mean, you come here because I know that 
you fly for the Heinen Brothers sometimes, which is like a whole different deal.     
AD: It's very different.     
EK: So how… I mean… I'm curious… Well, my brain’s hopping around here, but I know that like in 
some really tricky places like that helicopters will spray. Are you in a in a place where that would 
be appropriate, I mean is it that tricky? 
AD: Um, it's not… I don't think that there is any work here that should necessarily be done with a 
helicopter. Pretty much anywhere that helicopter can get, we can get with our smaller aircraft. So, 
a lot of companies are switching to turb… You know, they basically already switched to turbine 
aircraft. And you know who's left with recips [referring to  at this point is probably either highly 
considering switching to turbines or just doesn't have the capacity at this point, or doesn't realize 
they have the capacity to make the switch, which we thought for the longest time that there's just 
no way. We're just this little company in New Jersey, how are we going switch to turbines? What 
we've done is… The majority of our work can absolutely be done well with a turbine, even with the 
larger size and a faster speed. 
EK: What's the biggest thing that you have?  
AD: So we have two Air Tractors. And then we've retained one Weatherly and one Pawnee as both 
training aircraft because we hire… We typically don't hire Pilots that already have Ag experience. 
We've had, you know, pretty good success hiring the individuals that show the potential to make a 
good Ag Pilot and then we like to do all the training or at least supervise all the training ourselves. 
They start working on the ground as loaders. They help me with maintenance and then work their 
way into a seat. So those two airplanes serve as first year and the second year plane that they're 
going to fly before they move into a turbine, but they also are very, very maneuverable because 
they're slower, they carry a little lighter load. The Pawnee specifically is ridiculously 
maneuverable compared to the turbines. So when we do have jobs that have, you know, really 
small corners and that are that are just too tight to get in there with a turbine, you know, even 
myself or Emily or, you know, whoever can hop in the Pawnee and do a much better, thorough job 
in those tight areas. And so, it… Definitely there's a lot more moving parts to these… 
[00:20:00] 
AD: …you know, smaller farms that that have to have a lot more attention paid to them. However, 
you know, it does because it's a specialty crop, it does reflect in our in our pricing, but the most 
important thing, that our customers who have these specialty crops are looking for is, you know, 
to do a good job thorough coverage, you know? So, we don't really ever plan on completely getting 
away from the recips because they give us that wide range of, you know, the ability to get into 
small fields or big fields, you know. 
EK: So when you come here to… well, we’re not… we're in Missouri but we're not that far from the 
Heinen Brothers. When you come here, do you fly one of their planes or do you? [crosstalk] We 
talked to Aaron Phillips. He said that he had met you guys and he was… he didn't have it yet. He 
was in the process, or waiting for word to go pick up an 802 he was going to fly this year for the 
first time. And he was talking about like, where… how that would extend where he could go and 
stuff. And so I'm wondering… well you know what I'm wondering, so just… yeah. [laughter] 
AD: I mean what we did last year was kind of the first time that we'd ever ventured out of our kind 
of tri-state area. It's been going on for years. You know, I mean the corn run has been going on for 
years. There's also kind of a wheat run, and a bean run. Last year was the first time that we really 
stepped out and explored, you know, subbing or subcontracting for other operators. So with, you 
know, Heinen Brother’s specifically is one of the one of the operators that we work with out there. 
Last year I went out pretty late in the season, actually. My dad was out there flying somebody 
else's Air Tractor for him and ended up passing through the Heinen Brother’s airstrip, for some 
maintenance work on that airplane and met him. And they got, you know, they just started 
chatting and they had offered that I come out and fly one of their aircraft because they had a pilot 
that… I forget the situation. I think either he was having a medical issue or for some reason, they 
had an aircraft that wasn't working because they didn't have the pilot to fly it. So, I went out for a 
couple weeks and my wife actually ended up coming out a few days behind maybe because he 
had… he also had a Brave that was out there. And so the two of us flew his aircraft for a few weeks 
out there. And, Scott and I, Scott Heinen, while I was out there, we got the talking and he was 
actually interested in selling that aircraft that I was flying. So I purchased it later in the year, went 
back out and brought it home and that's actually one of the two turbines that we have right now. 
So I'll be bringing it back out and working for him, you know, maybe even multiple points 
throughout the year. Whenever he, you know, needs me. I'll head out there and it's kind of… You 
know, we're definitely branching out to help other operators, more and more. I think that that's 
probably comes more from the flexibility that we have because we're all so young. I mean, you 
know, none of us have kids. I mean, we got, you know, a couple dogs and my wife's got a bunch of 
chickens. [laughter] Other than that, it's pretty easy for us to pick up and move around and be 
flexible. So, you know, we can go where the work is.     
EK: Yeah. Yeah. I think Aaron told us that Heinen Brother’s have… Because I asked him, how many 
people flew for them. He said, “I don't know, but they’ve got like 30 planes. So… 
AD: They are a huge, huge, huge company. Yeah, they're… the Heinen Brother’s, from what I can 
tell, are just very, you know, old school blue-collar successful. They, Scott and Glenn and their 
whole family’s just really good people. I had an excellent experience out there working for them. 
[00:25:00] 
AD: I mean, when, you know, when it comes down to business, as you know, you got to you got to 
get the work done, because they have a lot of customers. But it seems to me, I mean, their success 
has come from just being there and making sure that, you know, they deliver on their promises. So 
that's the kind of people we like to work for or work with. And so we'll… yeah we'll see. I mean, 
you know, next season, this season should be a pretty big one with the price of grain and, you 
know, hopefully favorable conditions should make for a pretty busy season. 
EK: Yeah, it hasn't rained a lot. We got a couple inches the other the other day. Two days ago it 
rained all day long, but the wheat looks really good.  
AD: Yeah, and, I mean, the price of wheat is, you know, almost double what it was. So everybody is, 
I think, very, very, very optimistic and that kind of trickles down to, you know, to the support 
businesses which is… Farmers are going to be much more forward thinking and trying to get the 
most yield that they can, which is, you know, where we come into play. So… 
EK: Yeah. Is that… are the… The Heinen Brother’s: is that considered a co-op or is that just like 
vertical integration where they start as farmers and just instead of hiring people, they just take it 
on themselves? 
AD: Yeah, I would say they're not a co-op to my knowledge. It's very much so vertical integration. I 
mean, you know, it's, you know, we live in, you know, the greatest country in the world where you 
can do… You can go as far as you want to go and be as successful as you want to be. And I think 
that they’re a great example of that. They, you know, they took over their family farm, which was a, 
you know, a considerable farming operation, a farming and ranching operation. But, you know, 
through chemical sales, equipment rental, they do anhydrous, they do… I mean, they, you know, 
they grow seed and sell it. And then when the two brothers started the flying operation, it just 
opened up, you know, another facet to, you know, an avenue to do business. And so, you know, I 
definitely look up to their business model, as a, you know, a good example of what you can achieve 
if you're if you're willing to take risks and, you know, really sacrifice your own time and just 
always be available is what it really comes down to. So… 
                  
EK: So, do you… Around in your area are there co-ops? I guess… Some of the pilots have talked 
about coops and they… and flying for them. Is that… What is that… I don't quite understand what 
they are, I guess. I mean, or do you just fly for individual farmers? 
                  
AD: So co-ops for, you know… All right, so I'll use because I grew up cranberry farming. So, Ocean 
Spray is a co-op. So, you know, Ocean Spray has farmers that, you know, are pretty much locked-in 
to the co-op growing their fruit. It's, you know, it's allocated for Ocean Spray, they follow the co-op 
guidelines. It's almost more of a… Somewhere between a governing body and a company, you 
know.     
EK: So, do they lock in a price? Is that what they do? 
AD: Yeah. It's… and every Co-op is going to be different, you know, based on how it’s structured. 
So if you look at the cranberry industry specifically, only because I know I know it pretty well, we 
grew our fruit… because we also have a cranberry, I don’t know if Emily mentioned that. So, we 
always grew our fruit independently. So, we made our own sales, sometimes we would, you know, 
sell fresh fruit that was dry harvested and we would be going around individual grocery stores. 
And then other times, when we got to a larger scale, it was all, you know, it was all for juice fruit 
and we would sometimes be locked in a contract for two years here, three years there, to juicers.  
[00:30:00] 
AD: We've sold frozen fruit, but on the independent side, you get to do that. Which has its benefits 
and its drawbacks. When the market for cranberries was doing well, the independents were doing 
really, really well because we had flexibility to take advantage of, you know, certain corners of the 
market that the price was the best. However, the cranberry market took a pretty significant 
nosedive, it's probably 10 years ago now, maybe more than that. And so Ocean Spray was able to 
kind of dampen that market dive for their growers. So that it wasn't all, you know, the price didn't 
drop all in one swift drop. We went from making a dollar a pound down to 18 cents a pound in one 
year. So that's just kind of where that happened. So that’s one thing that co-op's do when it comes 
to contract and flying work. There's… you know, there's co-ops… Especially for grain. There's co-
ops that will contract the flying for all of their growers. There's a lot of sweet corn contracts, even 
around here. There're sweet corn contracts for a sweet corn Co-op that coordinates all the work, 
they do all the mapping for you and tell you when they want it, and, you know, what rates, and so 
the farmer doesn't even really have to worry about it. The…  
EK: Excuse me, a sec [short for second]. So a co-op can control how much money you make, too? 
Not just the [unintellible] 
AD: Well, not necessarily because we're not part of a co-op. So, a co-op is just going to contract a 
service, so what I mean, a co-op can go to any Flying Service. So, you know, we… they would say, if 
I was to make contact with some co-op who wanted us… to see if we wanted to spray, I would give 
them my prices and they would either, you know, they might try to make a barter with me or 
whatever. But as the business, you know, we set our own our own prices, and they either use us or 
don't…        
EK: That’s what I was wondering.  
AD: Yeah. So it's more for the farmer in the co-op. Now there are co-ops, there are coops that are 
big enough, that they've actually, you know, they own… basically, they own their own spray 
business. I've heard of those before, you know, around the country. There certainly aren't any 
around here. But that's, that's one of the things that's kind of been happening. 
EK: That doesn't seem like a good thing.  
AD: I don't know. I mean, It could be, it could be good if the coop is not happy with any of their, 
you know, any of the service that's available to them, you know, if there aren't any crop-dusting 
companies that are in their area that are, you know, meeting some standard that they're trying to 
achieve, then maybe they're just taking matters into their own hands, you know, and they got 
some, you know, a pilot that they trust, that they know does a good job, that, you know, maybe 
worked for one of the other companies and they say we're just not the service that we were 
looking for and we're just going to do it ourselves. Which happens, you know. I mean, it absolutely 
very well could happen that way, so… That's actually… it's kind of… It's funny you bring that up 
because it's almost the way our business got started. My grandfather… On my mom's side, I've 
been… I'm the fifth generation that's been farming here in this town. So my grandfather had a 
pretty good-sized blueberry operation, my father started the cranberry farm here and then we 
also have another really good family friend who's a big cranberry Farm around here, too. His 
name's Tom Bud, and my grandfather's name was Will Bush. So between the three of them, Tom, 
my grandfather and my dad. They weren’t necessarily happy about the service that they were 
getting from the Ag Pilots that were around here at the time. And so, my dad did exactly that… 
[00:35:00] 
AD: …and almost, like not officially started a co-op, but the intent was that my dad would start his 
own spray business. Just to spray, you know, his Fields, my grandfather's fields and Tommy Bud’s 
fields and so the three of them kind of partnered to buy, you know, one airplane and that's how 
that whole thing started when, you know, 25 years ago. So, you know… that's… it kind of falls back 
on that competition isn't always a bad thing. And then now… Look at where we are now, you 
know?  
EK: Well that's more like vertical integration though. I mean, you know, the… Which is kind of 
what the Heinen Brothers have done, I guess. 
AD: Yes, very much, I would say so.  
EK: Yeah. So, then your dad… That's when your dad started spraying when that plan was put into 
place?  
AD: Yeah. So he started the business to take care of our own farm, to take care of my grandfather's 
farms, and Tom Bud’s farm. It just, you know, it naturally took on a life of its own, you know, local 
farmers would get a hold of, you know, one of the three of them and say, “Hey can you spray me 
too? Can you spray me too?” just kind of took off. My dad’s also a pilot for American Airlines, so 
that keeps him pretty busy. And like I said, I was in the Air National Guard, busy doing that. But 
him and I made a pretty conscious effort going back, I don't know, maybe eight years ago or so. 
Basically, when the cranberry market took a took a stiff nose-dive, we decided to shift a lot of 
focus on the spray business and see where we could really take it. 
EK: Did… Is he the one who taught you how to… 
AD: Yeah. Yeah. My dad… When I was 14, he started teaching me to fly and so he brought me 
through my private license and my commercial license. I went to a community college down the 
road that had a flying program. I did some flying there towards my instrument rating and… But 
while I was, you know, while I was learning the basics of flying, he taught me in a way that was 
geared towards, you know, we know you're going to end up crop-dusting because I was very 
forward. I definitely want to do this, you know? And so basically soon as I turned… soon as I got 
my commercial license at 18, I was ready to go. I had tailwheel time and so it was it was, you 
know, a fast track towards getting to the point being able to spray, so… 
EK: So, you and Emily are kind of like a flying dynasty. 
AD: Like, maybe. [laughter] I don’t know. 
EK: She said her mom… 
AD: I’m more her sidekick now than anything else. [laughter] She's a really, really good pilot. And 
she is… You know, she genuinely cares about letting other young people know that, you know, you 
can do this even if you didn't grow up in this, as long as you… If you meet one person that is willing 
to help you, it'll open the world wide open. I mean, with, you know, with social media and Google 
and everything that we have now, you're like a three-minute Google search away from finding 
somebody that will help you break into the industry. So… 
EK: Yeah, I've really enjoyed her Instagram. When it's… it was time to really talk to her, It's like, I 
already know everything, I've seen your life! [laughter] 
AD: Yeah, that's for sure. She's got the social media game down. She's on there all the time. She's I 
wish I had a little more time to dive into that stuff, but I always seem like I’ve got a wrench in one 
hand and… 
[00:40:00] 
EK: So you do all the mechanical work on the planes, then.  
AD: Well, my – you know, myself, and we have mechanics that work here as well. Yeah, so we have 
one guy. His name is Ralph. Him and I were crew chiefs together on the F-16. He's got a lot of 
experience, and so him and I do a lot of the work together and then we just hired a guy named Pat 
who used to work on F-18s in the Navy, and he's actually down in Georgia at AMP [Aviation 
Maintenance Professional] school right now. He came to us because he had a lot of experience 
working on jets being in the military, and he also works as a contractor now for the military. But 
he wanted to get more experience working on, you know, older planes and recip engines. So, he 
started working here just to get some maintenance experience and now we, you know, we got him 
hooked. He wants to learn how to fly, he wants to be an Ag Pilot and so he's down at AMP school 
right now. So we're just constantly building our abilities and our team.  
EK: When you say work here, I mean usually we meet the pilots at the airport and sit in the hangar 
or wherever, Where exactly are you? Is it a big hangar or are you in this building? 
AD: Yeah, so I'm in the building now, I’m in the office. It’s on the farm that my dad built. When I 
was, you know, like four or five years old, he wanted to kind of diversify and give himself a few 
more options. The airlines weren't doing so great, so he bought a piece of blueberry ground from 
my grandfather and put cranberries in there. And so…  
EK: Uh oh, cranberries in blueberry ground?  
AD: Yeah, it was blueberry ground, and so there's a lot of, you know, engineering involved, but you 
gotta cut in the bogs, and plant, and everything. That's a whole… I can go on forever about the 
farming side. But so on this farm he built an airstrip and a hangar and it started with, you know, 
one, you know, decent size hangar. And then we ended up adding another on there, so the, the 
hangar that we're in now is about… I think it's about a hundred and eighty by 80, or by 70, with 
some mezzanines in the middle, and we're building those mezzanines out. We got one office now 
and we're going to be putting in two more offices here. So we've… And it's really neat to watch the 
whole thing happen, because yeah, I mean, when I was four years old, five years old, as far back as 
I can remember. I mean, this whole thing which is a piece of dirt, you know, and we got, you know, 
like just getting just getting cable for internet out here was like a hurdle, you know, you would 
think New Jersey, it wouldn't be a problem. But I mean, we're literally building every little tiny 
layer of the business from scratch. So yeah, Emily and I live, you know, five or so minutes down the 
road, so is my dad. And some of the guys have a little bit longer drive depending on, you know… 
But they're all from around here, so… We do bring in people in the summer sometimes when we 
need extra help from wherever, you know. We got a girl coming up from Texas this year, so she'll 
be staying here for a few months. [cross talk]. Well, she's getting her… She'll have her private 
when she gets here. She's actually going through one of the schools, to be an Ag Pilot. So, she's 
coming here. We actually met her for about a week and a half. Last year, she came out and did 
some loading for us and I told her she's… You know, we’d like to have her back to continue loading 
for this season so she can get that experience. So, yeah. I mean we're here just like all the time. 
[laughter] Seems like we never leave sometimes [laughter] 
EK: My oldest son has done some loading for the guy who actually started this whole interest, 
Dusty Elkinton. I don't know if you know him but yeah it's… but he's loaded for him some and, he 
said it's a hard job.  
[00:45:12] 
AD: It is a hard job. There is no way around that. I mean, this is a, you know, 4:30 in the morning 
sometimes until 10 o'clock at night, and you know, if you're lucky you catch, maybe an hour nap in 
the middle of the day, but there's… Especially when you're running the business, there's no way 
around it. This is just hard work, [crosstalk] but I love it. 
EK: Aaron Phillips. We talked to him, and he said he had met you and… But he was talking about 
how hard it was, and that it was just too much to fly all day, and then try to go home and do the 
business there. It was too many jobs.  
AD: That is absolutely right. I mean, I can already tell that I have to fill my shoes in a certain regard 
with some of the other people that work here. I mean, whether it's giving more acres to somebody 
else, or hiring somebody else to be able to cover those acres. Or, you know, just this year, because 
it did get to be just so much, we actually did a company organizational structure. Just between, you 
know, the five of us that work here and, you know, really kind of outlined, okay, you're doing, you 
know, sales and acquisitions. You're doing licensing. You're doing, you know, this and that and the 
other thing. That is that is a big, big concern, industry-wide is, when you're in the airplane, you 
really need to stay focused on the task at hand, and there's, you know, there's a lot of things going 
on when you're trying to run a business and, you know, fly the way we fly. So it takes a certain 
kind of, you know, individual to be able to compartmentalize hours and hours and hours in a row.                  
EK: Dusty said that… He said, “One thing I never do is I never fly mad” and, you know, there are a 
lot of reasons, you know, to get mad. Whether it's the loader or whatever. Like, you just said. He 
said, “I'll taxi out to the end of the runway, and sit there until my head's empty and then I'll take 
off” 
AD: Gotta get your head on right.   
EK: But he said, “I never find mad.” So, how were you able to make time for us today? Is the 
weather bad today? 
AD: Um, we’re still kind of just getting rolling into the season. We've done few jobs here and there, 
but what really doing now is putting the kind of the final touches on the maintenance side and we 
installed a bunch of avionics this year. So, I… Just being flexible the most important part. So, yeah. 
I'm good at that. 
EK: On Instagram I saw that that you went to Louisiana, the guy that I follow, it's Matt Peed or 
something like that, or…? 
                  
AD: Matt, okay, yeah. He's a…. Matt’s in Georgia. Yeah, we visited him. We did… Every year Emily 
and I take kind of a road trip, a work vacation more than anything else. But this past year, we 
ended up visited him on our trip through Georgia. Matt Peed is just one of the best guys I've ever 
met. So if you get an opportunity to talk him, I would highly suggest it. He's a really good dude. 
Huge, huge advocate for young people getting into the industry. He’s really taking mentorship 
seriously and just overall really, really good guy.  
EK: We've been… let's see…. Do you… Is there anything… We always kind of like to end on – 
because I know you're a busy man – is there a last word you'd like to put in? Just anything you 
haven't touched on or that you are passionate about or anything? 
AD: Yeah, I would just say… 
[00:50:00] 
AD: I would say that one of the biggest hurdles that we have as an industry is the perception of 
what we do, and, you know, I guess you could call it a misconception, but one of the things they 
teach you in Officer School in the Air Force is perception is reality, right? So it's a constant effort 
for us as an industry to change the perception of what we do. So that it's a better understanding 
for the people who have their concerns. So, I mean, and what I tell, you know, people that they call 
with concerns is that… You know, what we’re applying has been tested ad nauseam. I mean, you 
know, look at… You know, they’ve pushed a vaccine and, you know, around a year and these 
chemicals get tested for over 10 years before they're even released. So the chemicals… The 
applicators are… Well, let's go with the aircraft are extremely safe. I mean, especially with the 
turbines now, right? We have to meet the same level of safety as any other aircraft that's flying 
overhead. We're just a little closer and a little noisier so, we, you know, we see you. And then the 
last, the last thing is, you know, the pilots. And that's where I do appreciate the approach that the 
two of you are taking as more of a, you know, from the folklore aspect. Because it's interesting that 
so much of learning how to do our job is not written down on a piece of paper. It really isn't, and 
what the good thing is that the type of Industry where you're learning from somebody who's been 
doing it for 40 or 50 years and there's just no way that it could be written down on a piece of 
paper. I mean it's a… So I always just try to advocate for what we do is the, you know, the most 
efficient and because of our level of training in a lot of ways, especially from the application of the 
chemical point of view, it actually is the safest because we go through so much training. And we're 
so high profile, because we're so loud and in your face all the time, we have to do a good job. So 
that's my plug for the industry, I guess. 
EK: Well it's accurate. You know you can’t sit in a school for 16 weeks and learn everything that 
that… 
AD: That is true. Yeah that's one thing that I tell people that are getting into the industry is… I tell 
them there's nothing wrong with going to these schools, these accelerated school programs and 
there's, you know, that's a good way to learn it in a canned environment. If you're the type of 
needs to sit down and focus and but, you know, that's only, you know, one piece of the puzzle, the 
other is being hands-on, and working with an operator. Starting on the ground loading aircraft. 
Sitting down at lunch and just listening to pilots talk about, you know, the tree limb that that didn't 
you know it was dead and it didn't have the leaves on it, so it was harder to see than the other 
limbs with the leaves still on it and it snuck up on him and those are things that you gotta listen to 
and learn in person from Pilots. So yeah, that's kind of the progression of our… The training, in our 
industry. And I think it's for the better to learn things like this hands on. 
                  
EK: I'm really impressed by you and Emily and just your integrity and your training, it would seem 
to me that the profession is in really good hands with this new generation, and especially you two. 
Because I know that just from her Instagram that, you know, You're out there pushing for this, 
pushing for understanding.  
AD: Yeah, I appreciate that. We take it seriously, and, you know, it's a family business and, you 
know, safety… 
[00:55:00  
AD: …is very, very important. It can't be overlooked with something like this. And so the right 
mentorship for young people that are just getting their start will turn into, you know, a career-
long, you know, safe, efficient, Ag Pilot. 
                  
EK: What does Dusty say about Landing? 
SK: He says take-offs are optional, landings are mandatory. 
AD: [laughing]That is true. That is true. You're coming down one way or the other.  
EK: He's a… He pretty much taught himself and he doesn't have the intellect that you and Emily 
have about the job, but he's really instinctive and he… Everything that you just said, he just like he 
does, but he could never say it as well as you, you know. But he's a really good pilot and… 
AD: Yeah, there's a lot of… there's a lot of old-school Ag Pilots out there that are just the best stick 
and rudder Pilots that you'll ever meet. And I think it's just important. I mean I learned from one of 
them, my dad is one of them, and I just really think that it's good to… I think that our generation, 
like the younger generation learns in a different way and to be able to open it up to, you know, a 
group of people that have the potential to learn it, but maybe don't necessarily learn it that way 
and kind of a different, little more structured environment to be able to break into that if they 
didn't grow up around it or anything else. I think that's kind of what we're really trying to achieve 
is to give people that option? 
EK: Can I take our picture here? 
AD: Yeah, sure!  
EK: You and Emily are the first virtuals. It's a little hard to do it virtual, you know, but you've been 
great. I think we're going to wind it up and like I told Emily if you guys get in this area, even a 
couple hours away, we'd love to meet up and buy you a beer and, you know, if you're going to fly 
for Heinen Brothers again let us know and… Heck, Supper! Forget the beer, we’ll drink the beer 
with supper. Okay, thank you, Austin.
