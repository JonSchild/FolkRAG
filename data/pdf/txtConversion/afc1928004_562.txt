THAT MAN FROM COHOES. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
COPYRIGHT, 1881 BY VAL J. A. LIEDER. 
Oh! I'll sing of a 
gallent young man, 
He was born in the town of Cohoes; 
His head was flat as a 
bedstead slat, 
He used to wear hen-skin shoes. 
His neck it was covered with scars, 
With freckles all over his tongue; 
His nose was hooked, his legs were crooked, 
He looked like a 
tramp or a 
bum. 
CHORUS. 
But he catched the croup while eating soup, 
And they thought he was a 
goner; 
lie got sore eyes from looking at pies, 
In a 
grocery round the corner. 
He had a 
face like a 
Texas steer, 
Eyes like a 
soft shell crab, 
lie had the glanders and yellow janders, 
They thought he would go mad. 
His head it was big as a 
drum, 
He was tongue-tied in the feet; 
He fell through a 
hall and busted his gall, 
And landed way out in the street. 
He'd a 
big wort in his ear; 
And a 
cancer on his back; 
While Shoveling fog he was bit by a 
dog, 
And they packed him home in a 
sack. 
Chorus. 
But his mouth got twisted from eating hot biscuit, 
And his lungs turned inside out; 
His eye-brows grew on the back of his neck, 
- 
And his teeth they all fell out. 
When he'd walk the street his back would squeak, 
And he always had the blues; 
"73:e was long and thin like a 
piece of tin, 
This man that was born in Cohoes. 
Chorus.

Oh! I've got a 
black and tan daughter, 
She went to act out on the stage, 
In Uncle Tom's Cabin she sang Swanee river, 
When Thomas and Eva was all the rage. 
One night she tried to play Topsey, „ 
The gang in the gallery threw beans, 
And half of the audience crawled under their scab% 
When my daughter jumped out through the scenes. 
Cnottos. 
8h:turned a 
flip flap like a 
big keg of beer, (Break.) 
Came down through the base drum and tore off 
her ear; (Break.) 
Waltzing round in a 
big coffee sack, 
With her hair done up in sardines, 
All the musicians crawled under the stage, 
When my daughter jumped out through the scenes. 
In the plantation scene she got crankey, 
McCloskey hit her with a 
whip; 
She pulled out a 
razor with a 
big yellow handle, 
And gave all the niggers the Pittsburg grip. 
Mark's the lawyer went down through a 
trap, 
And busted his suit of blue jeans, 
And the audience thought a 
gas tank had bursted, 
When my daughter jumped out through the scenes. 
CHORUS. 
She had a 
mouth like a 
big cucumber, . ( Break.) 
And her heels stuck out like a 
freight-car bumper, 
(Break.) 
Waltzing ronnd in her over-shoes, 
She only wears seventeens, 
All the supes got out in the alley, 
When my daughter jumped out through the scenes.

I'll sing of a 
man he could stand on his head, 
He used to sell sausage with mustard and bread; 
He used to sell sausages two for a 
dime, 
In swaet Cincinnatti way over the _Rhine. 
This man had a 
can that was made out of tin, 
That he used to put sausage and horse-radish in; 
With a 
lamp in the bottom the sausage to cook. 
For a 
nickle he'd bring you up one with a 
hook. 
When night would- come on he would shoulder himain. 
And he'd sail all around the great city of hams; 
He'd swell himself op like a 
big lump of yeast, 
And he'd yell hot winerwost five cents apiece. 
Of a 
sausage machine this man he was boss, 
If a 
dog went that way he always got lost; 
And the cats on the fence, oh 
bow they would htigthe. 
When they saw old Winerworst out on his tougtte. 
One night he got full, and went to a 
show, 
And like it steam engine this man he did blow, 
He'got bit in the head with a 
schooner of beer, 
And died with a 
winerwc!st stuck in his ear. 
PARODY ON EMPTY CRADLE, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN.. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name was 
Towser Jenkins, 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the eats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
lie wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseing milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties him, • 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic 
in his grub, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting grainds 
lie died this morning while the sun was rising; 
The flees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Oh! how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at him, 
He used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseing cats around corn cribs, 
Had bunions on his knees from jumping ditches, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
, Where the rats chewed off his whiskers, 
When he was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He has gone to hunt for liver, 
Way acrossed-the Swanee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise him, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin'can's upon his tail, 
Empty is the dog-house-Towser's pizened. 
A 
CHINESE SONG, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
I'll sing of a 
heathen, his name was Harp Lee, 
Run a 
Chinee laundry in Cincinna-tee; 
His hair hung down like the tail of an ox, 
And he wore cork shoes without any socks. 
CHOR1JS. 
Ching-er-ring-er-ring, -and a 
hop go ling, 
These Chinamen were a 
caution; 
They slept od mats and lived on rats, 
These guys that took in washing. 
This man had a 
pardner, he cooked chow chow. 
He'd a 
big yellow face, and a 
mouth like a 
cow; 
He had a 
half moon each side of his nose, 
And he wore his shirt outside of his clothes. 
Chorus. 
Now these two Heathens saved every cent, 
And to Phila-ma.delphia on a 
visit they went, 
And at the Centennial among the experts, 
,These guys took the cake for polishing shirts. 
Chorus.

PARODY ON LITTLE ROBIN TELL 
KITTY PM COMING. _ 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS G.IDDEN. 
Little Robin tell Kitty I'm coming, 
Sunday night when the parlor is full; 
We will give Baby Mine a 
wind pudding, 
With a 
razor we'll cut off his wool. 
Yes, tell her I've been to the opera, 
With the Babies that Live on our Block; 
But one of the kids got his back up, 
And kicked the wheels out of Grandfather's Clock. 
Yes tell her the Day I 
Played Base Ball, 
My head it swelled up like a 
churn; 
And that Grant mane a 
trip round the world, 
But he didn't catch on the third term. 
Yes, tell her, but Not Before Pa Dear, 
Such an Education has my Mary Ann, 
On an Erie Canal Boat she's breaking, 
And the Villian Pursues her by land. 
Go tell her that Roger O'Malley, 
On the Elevated Railroad is switching; 
And Johanna who lives up in Harlem, 
Wears Galways and works in the kitchen. 
Yes, tell her I've seen Little Buttercup, 
Eating chPese with the Man in the Moon, 
Dick Dead Eve yelled out, Git thee Gone Girl, 
And got hit with a 
rubber spittoon.

PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
I 
live around on Thompson street, 
Where Nigger babbies grow; 
If you happen to go round that way, 
Big rocks at you they'll throw. 
They sit around upon the steps, 
And lay out on the rugs, 
And when they've nothing else to do, 
They punch each others mug's. 
There's black ones, yellow ones, 
Some the colle,r of glue, 
And when they tackle liver, 
You ought to see them chew; 
Their eyes stick out like onions, 
As up the street they sail, 
They'll paralyse an organ grinder, 
And pull the monkey's tail. 
CHORUS. 
Little Nigger babies, 
Black face and shiney eyes, 
Just as good as white thrash, 
In the sweet bye and bye. 
Black because we's born that way, 
With kidneys in our feet, 
Is sung by the Nigger babies 
A 
living on our- street. 
They'll make a 
black cat skip the gutter, 
Is up the street they march; 
They'll sail into a 
Chinese laundry, 
And eat up all the starch. 
They'll wrestle with a 
big mince pie, 
Devour it at one bite; 
They'll make a 
chicken jump his roost, 
At twelve o'clock at night, 
There's fat ones lean ones, 
Walking for the cake; 
The fat ones take the pudding, 
And the lean ones eat the plate, 
They sit round upon the roof, 
And skate round in the gutter, 
And the biggest babie carries a 
razor, 
And calls himself a 
cutter. 
Chorus. 
BURLESQUE ON AILEEN ALANAs 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS GLIDDEN. 
Aileen Alanna, Aileen asthore, 
Was born in the country, 
Along with Barnum's Show; 
They cut her eye teeth with a 
brick, 
And raised her like a 
calf; 
And she done *flip flaps on a 
banlkey horse, 
And made the gillies laugh. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! yes, she was a 
crusher, 
And she used to grease her musc!e, 
She wore a 
patent corset, 
And a 
double breasted bustle. 
She'd throw her eye at all the guys, 
As round the ring she went, 
And she chewed plug tobacco like a 
horse. 
Aileen Alanna, ! how that girl could snail 
She bad a 
mouth like a 
railroad crossing, 
Teeth like a 
cross cut pile, 
Her favorite dish was cross-eyed fish, 
She said it gave her brain; 
She went to a 
dentist, he pulled her breath, 
And she liked to went insane. 
Chorus. 
I 
wonder where her daddy is, 
If he only found it out, 
Perhaps he swallowed a 
porous plaster, 
Or else he's got the gout. 
Perhaps he's doing a 
song and dance, 
Way up in that back room, 
Oh! daddy, dear daddy come home. 
ChorilS. 
Aileen Alanna, some one set her drunk, 
Tony Pastor found her, 
- 
And held her under a 
pump; 
Brother Beacher took her home, 
And sent her off to bed, 
And old John Robinson, 
Rubbed blue glass on her head. 
Chorus 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
I've a 
baby in Kalamazoo, baby mine, baby mine, 
He can skip the tra-la-la-lu, baby mine, baby mine; 
He swings on our back gate, 
Spits tobacco juice in his plate, 
On a 
fish-ball he can skate, baby mine, baby mine, 
He can eat a 
barrel of cake, baby mine, baby mine. 
At the table he's so queer, baby mine, baby mine, 
Jaws the pan-cakes in his ear, baby mine, baby mine. 
He rubs 'lasses on his nose, 
Spills the mustard on his clothes, 
Jabs the hash between his toes,baby mine, baby mine 
And we wash him with a 
hose, baby mine, baby mine. 
He makes faces at the wimmen, baby mine, baby mine. 
In the soup bowl he goes swimming, 
baby mine, baby mine. 
From the ash pan we do yank him 
In his high chair we do plank him, 
And oh! heavens, how we spank him, 
baby mine, baby mine, 
And his face would cave a 
bank in, 
baby mine, baby mine. 
BUY GOAT SONG, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS OLDEM 
Oh ? once there lived a 
snoozer, 
And he owned a 
billy goat; 
His skin was tough as leather, 
And shaggy was his coat. 
His bead was nickel plated, 
And his teeth were like a 
file; 
He'd catch you on the fly, 
And he'd raise you half a 
mile. 
Ile bucked a 
Chinaman over a 
fence, 
And broke a 
nigger's back; 
Ile stopped a 
one horse street car, 
And he bucked it off the track. 
He bucked a 
policeman over a 
house, 
That took him for a 
fool; 
lie bit a 
yellow dog in two, 
And paralysed a 
mule. 
He bucked a 
canal boat over a 
bridge, 
And split a 
one horse dray, 
Ile bucked an organ grinder 
Clean through a 
load of hay. 
He bucked a 
brass band up the street, 
And the people held their breath, 
When be backed up to a 
big stone wall, 
And bucked himself to death.

When I 
was a 
lad about sixteen, 
I 
travelled with a 
circus and sold ice cream; 
I 
polished up the handle of the elephants trunk. 
tind slept in a 
cage with a 
big sick monk. tBreA 
I 
done my work in such a 
iage, 
They made me ruler of the monkey's cage; 
I 
fed them on the European plan; 
And they got so weak they could not stand. 
When the show would commence, I'd watch for beats. 
With a 
club I'd sail round under the seats; 
My legs got crooked and my back got bent, 
Watching for kids sneaking under the tent. 
(Break. 
I 
said " what, never," to a 
mule in fun, 
And got kicked through the roof of the big bass drum. 
It wasn't the fall that made me kick, 
But stopping quite so sudden made me sick. 
• 
They brought me to, with a 
kerosene pump, 
And the doctor said I 
was off my chump, 
They laid me out on the trick mule's back, 
And I 
went, through the roof when he took up 
the slack. 
(Break.) 
Came down head first, and went clean through a 
drar, 
The horse got frightened and he ran away; 
My voice got broke and my face got scarred. . 
And now I'm door-tender in a 
big grave yard.

STAGE STRUCK. 
COMIC BANJO SOLO. 
WRITTEN & SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
CM5YRIGRI 1881, BY MRS. PAULINE LIEBER. 
I'll tell you about a 
young man that I 
know, 
He was struck on the actors, likewise the show; 
HQ 
had a 
big wart on the side of his nose, 
From Nicoll the tailor, he got all his clothes. 
He tried to make love to " Aileen Alanna," 
And got hit on the head with a 
rusty bananna; 
He went to sit down in a 
ballet girl's lap, 
And got hit with a 
dummy, and fell through a 
trap. 
CHORUS. 
His front name was Billy, and a 
mule kicked 
him silly, 
While going up an alley to see his girl Sally, 
He struck on his head, and they thought he was demi 
For he was badly pock-marked from eating stale brea, 
Be kicked the wheels out of " Grandfather's clock," 
And hit " Baby Mine" in the ear with a 
rock; 
In the railroad strike he got lost in the street, 
And walked till his corns were covered with feet. 
He tried to play base ball, the boys got him tight, 
He got hit with a 
bat and went clear out of sight; 
He went up in the gallery to keep the boys quiet, 
And got shot in the back at the Baltimore Riot. 
CHORUS. 
His teeth were home-made, seven dollars he paid, 
On his breath you could ride, like a 
clam in high tide; 
Be dressed like a 
mummy and thought it was funny, 
To be taken for a 
gawk without any money.

MARY'S LITTLE CORNI 
Mary had a 
little corn, 
Upon her little 'toe, 
And everywhere that Mary went, 
That corn was sure to go. 
It followed her to jail, one day, 
For Mary she drank rum; 
And now she'll have a 
chance to pare her corn 
For thirty days to come. 
LITTLE WILLIE, 
Little Willie would read novels, 
And play hunter all the day; 
He wanted to be an Indian scout, 
No matter what you'd say. 
Be bought him a 
little pistol, 
And put on his father's boots, 
And started for the western wilds, 
To hunt the savage Utes, 
No more he'll need the pistol. 
There's a 
wreath upon his brow; 
The Indian's went to his funeral. 
Little pants are vacant now.

As through life we journey onward, 
Queer sayings one hears, when traveling about; 
Some are odd, peculiar expressions, 
As " Put away the cradle baby's out." 
So now with your kind attention, 
I'll sing of the latest one to you; 
One that's sure to catch the fancy, 
And also become a 
popular one, too. 
Spoken.—You have heard all the expressions. 
" 
You're too fresh," " You're too new," etc, but 
the latest is— 
CHORUS. 
" 
Tie him up, my friend," tie him up, 
Tie him up, now mind what I 
say; 
You'll be sorry when you're sober, 
And your little spree is over, 
Tie him up, without any delay. 
This world is composed of all sorts of people. 
Who occupy different stations in life, 
The rich and the poor are mingled together, 
A 
living to gain in this sea of strife. 
It matters not where fortune may bring you, 
Slang phrases one hears from day to day; 
The old and the young the same it both pleases. 
As " I 
should remark," and " Nay, Gussie, nay.° 
Spoken—Yes, one hears some very odd, peculiar 
upressions through travelling about, but I 
think 
OH 
latest and the best one is— 
Chorus.

As we walk thro' the streets how often we meet, 
Some poor old man who's life is naught but woe; 
With age his form is bent, in his pockets not a 
cent. 
And for shelter he knows not where to go. 
With relations by the score who drive him from the door, 
And mee. him on the street they pass him by, 
If you ask him why it's done, he will answer 
you and say, 
I 
am poor and old and only in the way. 
CHORUS. 
SQ,,let us cheer them on, they won't be with us long. 
Don't let us sneer because they're old and gray; 
And remember while we are young the days to 
us may corn 
When we'll be old and only in the way. 
There was a 
time I 
hear when the young were 
not so queer, 
But since that time there's came an awful change, 
Young men in health and might, their old 
parents they will strike, 
It happens every day, it's nothing strange. 
When he his bread can't earn, his children do 
him spun! 
For death I 
am sure he oftentimes does pray, 
himself and faithful wife after toiling all their life, 
When old they find they're only in the way. 
Cht,, 
My 
little song I'm sure is for rich as well as poor; 
For take a 
rich man when he's growing old, 
His friends will shake his hand, his relations 
round him stand. 
Awaiting for him to die they want his gold. 
Then let us from this hour, do all that's in our power. 
To make the road for the old folks light and gay, 
And if they trouble'on us cast, why let us be the last. 
To say when old that they are only in the way. 
Chorus.

One summer morn while rambling 
Down through the fields so green; 
Where hawthorn blossoms gently blow, 
I 
met Alice Aileen. 
,Jo flaxen were her ringlets, 
Her eyes of Heavenly blue, 
So laughing and bewitching, 
• Like a 
dart they pierced me through.

When rosy May comes in with flowers; (Break) 
To deck her gay green spreading bowers; (Break.) 
its there I 
love to roam, 
With her my little bright sunbeam, 
ghe is my life, my guiding star, 
My sweet Alice Eileen. 
In a 
shady nook far down the lane, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower, 
Beside a 
crystal falling stream, 
Oh! what a 
happy hour. 
'Tis there she whispered, 
I'll be thine, I 
love, I 
love but thee; 
And murmured low, when we are wed, 
So happy I 
will be.

She's the prettiest and the wittiest,

She's as pretty as a

And her voice is just a

Half hid her face in shadow.

sighed her eyes replied, 
They shone like diamonds there; 
She's as pretty as a

And you never miss the sun whenever she

She's as pretty as a

When 'twas time to go, we talked so low, 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport 'twas cupid caught, 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
told her so as I 
turned to go, 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And slip drooped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you ' au revoir." 
She's as pretty as a

And my heart's a

you may find he;

Oh! love it is such a 
very funny thing, 
It catches the young and the old, 
It's iust like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
For many's the man's been sold. 
It will make you feel like a 
fresh-water eel, 
It will cause your heart for to swell, 
You may love your wife as you do your life, 
But ' twill empty your pocket-book as well. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You will find when you're wed, they'll bang 
you till you're dead, 
With the bawld-headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man's in love with a 
pretty little girl, 
lie talks as gentle as a 
dove, 
Be calls her his honey, and he spends lots of money, 
For to show her he's solid in love. 
When his money's all gone, and his clothes up 
the spout, 
He will find the old saying true, 
That a 
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, 
What the deuce is a 
fellow going to do. 
'With a 
wife and fourteen half-starved kids, 
And tell you it ain't no fun, 
'When the butcher comes around to collect his bills, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrelled gun. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You'll think you are in clover, till the honey-
moon is over, 
And then you will wish you were dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
With a 
wife with a 
wart on her nose, 
You will find that love don't run so smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes 
'When the rents are high the kids will cry, 
Kase they ain't got nothing for to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son to load up the gun, 
For to vaccinate your mother-in-law.

Lonely and weary, poor, homeless, forsaken, 
Out in the cold bitter hours of the night, 
Wandering far away, while fears awaken, 
Dread of the fast coming sunbeams of light. 
Far from the home and the pleasures of childhood, 
With vile companions an exile from joy ; 
Longing once more for the charms of the wildwood, 
And for dear mother to welcome her boy. 
Citonus. 
Go for my boy for I 
know he's heart broken, 
Bring him once more to life's sunshine and joy, 
Thus in the old home a 
dear voice has spoken, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy, 
Cold is the night , and the wintry wind blowing. 
Chills the poor wanderer, friendless, afar ; 
While in the darkness, which way is he going? 
Must he repose ' neath the pale evening star ? 
Wine is a 
mocker, then why is be seeking. 
That which will mar his pure heart with alloy, 
While a 
sweet. voice now is tenderly speaking, 
Mother is waiting to welcome her boy.

Mother is Waiting to Welcome her Boy. 
CONTINUED. 
Oh ! how she peers in the face of each stranger, 
Eager to see her boys smiles once again ; 
Longing and praying to shield him from danger, 
Anxious to care for and soothe him in pain, 
Lone is the heart of that poor mother waiting, 
Wrinkled and gray, for one moment of joy; 
While with his evil companions he's straying, 
Far from the mother who longs for her boy. 
Go for my boy, drc, 
Once he was pure as the babe in the manger, 
lint friends were false, and they led hill'. astray, 
Far front his home he has wandered a 
stranger, 
Reckless through drink, as you see him to-day! 
But who can tell how his heart has been saddened, 
When he has dreamed of lost friendship and joy, 
With no sweet thoughts when his brain has been maddened 
Mother would welcome her wandering boy. 
Go for my boy, dtc. 
Go for my by to-night! search through the city ! 
Tell him that mother will never forget! 
Though he is fallen— oh I 
bring hint in pity, 
Back to the mother who loves her boy yet! 
Tell him she never will weary of prayirg 
For Iris return bringing emnshine and joy; 
Bear hint this message, where'er he is straying, 
Mother is waiting to welcome Iner b

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FRANK 1,1731. 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night. 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there. 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
Go yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chomp' 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mas, 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus, 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song, 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night. 
Chorus.

One night I 
was invited, 
To attend a 
fancy ball; 
I 
dressed myself up in my best, 
I 
hurried to the hall. 
All sorts were there, I 
do declare, 
And sweet music it was play'd; 
We had a 
jolly racket 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade! 
CHORUS. 
Hands all around, boys! 
Sweet music it was play'd; 
Arrah I 
forward four, we welt the floor, 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade. 
At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade— 
Old Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade ! 
Marta., 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
He waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with axel grease, 
He had a 
five cent shave; 
TE would make you die when to waltz he tried, 
The night of 'the masquerade.

THE BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAIN& 
CLARABELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPHEN ADANA, 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
maiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning, 
Ingel bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning, 
A-de, A-de, Ade_ 
Such songs 
pass away; 
Tho the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway ! 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passed, 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A- de, A-de, A-de, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A- de, A-de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And he lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A- de, A- de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway.

In rapture round the place. 
With steps elastic, quick or slow, 
It seems a 
fairy spell, 
fold makes my heart more joyous feel, 
Than words can ever tell.

If anything should chance me,

I'll emigrate to somewhere else,

As o'er the trotting course one day, 
My horse was quickly gliding; 
I 
met a 
gay and pretty blonde 
In a 
pretty phaeton riding. 
I 
quickly threw a 
kiss at her, 
Which caused the boys to stare, 
I 
noticed as she threw it back, 
She'd a 
ribbon in her hair.

Oh I 
goodness gracious, me, 
But wasn't she nice; 
Her hand I'm bound to gain 
At any price.

With the ribbon in her hair.

My former ground retracing; 
Away we flew, and soon I 
found, 
That this girl was with me racing, 
The fun began in earnest now, 
A 
mile or more was run, 
When she sang out defiantly, 
Come and catch me if you can. 
I 
said all right, my pretty lass, 
I'll soon be with you tripping; 
If you will give me one sweet kiss. 
While we o'er the track are skipping. 
Says she come on, and in a 
trice, 
I'd passed her on the square; 
I 
won the kiss from that dear girl 
With the ribbon in her hair.

BEAUTIFUL SONG AND CHORUS. 
On that dark, foggy night when the ill-fated steamer Narra-
gansett was sinking with its scores of precious souls, a 
lonely 
mother, traveling with her little child, was among those whose 
safety lay througa unknown perils. 
While she was preparing 
to leap from the burning* wreck, her little child, with heartfelt 
pathos, cried, " OH, TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS, MAMA 
I" 
She tried to brave the angry billows with her darling one; but, 
alas, 
her efforts were in vain. The arms that held the cherished 
one relaxed their loving embrace, and when again the mother 
beheld the little pieader the once bright eyes were closed for-
ever. She had exchanged mother's love for that of the angels.

Darker grew the hours of waiting, 
With no ray of hope in sight, 
While the mother clasped her darling, 
In her arms of love that night. 
In the waves so tired and feeble, 
Struggling for her darling's sake, 
Was that mother weak and hop less, 
Praying for the dawn to break. 
But the arms that held her pleader. 
Soon relaxed f strength had gone, 
And the mother broken-hearted, 
In her grief was all alone. Chola% 
When the morning dawned in beauty, 
With the sun-beams clear and bright, 
She went home alone to papa, 
Leaving child and love that night.

When I

I 
could scarce believe my own,

It was death in every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
you helieved them all they say ; 
You are false, but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I

You are false, but 
forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may ! 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do - not love me? 
Turn aside, how can it be? 
You have left me for another, 
You have turned from rue away ; 
You are false. lint

There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung. 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Wow the tambo and the bones, am forever laid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
iknd before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of 
day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung, 
And my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Now the ta,mbo, &a.

While strolling out alone one summer's day, 
Down by a 
running brook, 
A 
pretty girl I 
chanced to meet, 
I 
never shall forget her look. 
With dark blue eyes and golden • hair, 
And teeth as white as snow, 
Her heart I 
won in the shining sun, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. 
CHORUS. 
When the birds are singing in the glittering sunshine. 
There's none so fair as this pretty girl of mine, 
I 
never shall forget where first we met, 
My pretty little beau, 
One summers night when the moon shone bright, 
Where pretty lilacs grow. 
(Dance.) 
There is a 
happy day to come, 
A 
day I'll never dread, 
'When together to the church we go, 
And this pretty little maid I 
wed. 
Where the little birds are singing in the tree, 
We'll ramble to and fro, 
And ne'er forget where first we met, 
Where pretty lilacs grow.

One lovely day in June. 
Strolling just for pleasure 
Down in a 
quiet nook, 
I 
met my hearts delight there, 
On the bridge that crosses the brook.

She's the fairest one I've seen, 
My pretty daisy little queen ;

On the bridge that crosses the brook. M IMI. 
We talk,d and laughed togethor, 
She smiled on me so sweet, 
I 
blushed, my heart did flutter, 
When our eyes did meet, 
I 
told her that I 
loved her, 
She thanked me with a 
smile, 
Now together we do cherish—yes, 
The bridge that crosses the brook.

Joys of, my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours of the past I 
shall never more see, 
Flowers of the wild wood and home by the river, 
Yes gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Rocks that I 
loved in the days of my childhood, 
And brooklets by whose peaceful waters I'd play, 
While watching the sunbeams which brightened the wilds/04 
Live only in memories chambers to- day. 
CHORUS. 
Joys of my childhood are now gone forever, 
Bright hours .of the past I 
shall never more see; 
Flowers in the wildwood and home by the rivr, 
Yes, gone are the joys that were once dear to me. 
Hours of my childhood come back in my dreaming, 
Once more in my fancy I 
see vale and hill, 
That flowing streaudet whose waters were gleaming, 
While leaping o'er cascades to run the old will. 
Forest of oaks where the sweet birds were singing. 
And roses abloom ' neath the fair summer sky, 
'In dreams of the past sweet remembrance is bringing, 
ure 
Of days I 
once cherished forever gone by. 
Dave of my childhood I 
love to remember, 
Bright hours of the past with their merry good cheer; 
Bloom of the valley from May to December,

he snow flakes which heightened the rust of the year. 
Then in the fail, picking apples so golden, 
(Jr making the sliver when springtime had come, 
We love to recount jcvs of childhood so olden, 
When sunbeams shine brightly on dear ones at home. Obal

Sweetly in the twilight dancing, 
Fairy-like with form entrancing, 
Cunning elf with mischief glancing, 
Little roguish eyes; 
O'er the dew with lightness creeping, 
While the glow-worm soft is sleeping, 
And the bright stars forth are peeping, 
Peeping with surprise. 
As she wanders through the dell, 
Hushed is every birdie's song, 
For each songster knows full well, 
She rules the warbling throng. 
Brighter seems the day declining, 
As with sunlight still combining, 
Where her gleam o'er all is shining, 
Little roguish eyes. 
(Dson4 
Blithely in the early morning, 
Summer (14,ty is gently dawning, 
Lifting night s 
be-darkened awning, 
Little roguish eyes; 
As she wades the brooklet flowing, 
Moves amid the violets growing, 
Not a 
thought on one bestowing, 
Which around her lies. 
May her future life be pure, 
May her sweetness never fade, 
May grim sorrow ne'er secure, 
My own dear mountain maid. 
Joy o'er all my darling flinging, 
Hear the lark her praises singing, 
For to all sweet mirth she's bringing, 
Little roguish eyes, (Doesift)

It's of a 
social party that I 
will sing to you, 
They're going for to give a 
fancy ball; 
Sure we got invitations and of course we must attend, 
'Twill be held down here Swallerholla Hall. 
There'll be singing there'll be dancing, and 
all-such lots of fun, 
When the music's playing sweetly in the hall; 
The O'Leary's, O'Cleary's, O'Brien's and Donohoe'z 
Will be spelling at McCarthy's Fancy Ball.. 
CHORUS. • 
We waltzed away to music so gay, 
Up and down the hall, 
With great delight, we danced all night, 
At McCarthy's Fancy Ball. 
When they play a 
polka. a 
schottische, or a 
waltz, 
Then you take your girl out for to dance; 
Come on, Mary Grogan, let us have some fun, 
Enjoy yourself now while you got the chance, 
All the servant girls, sure, they'll be there, 
' Dressed in their clothes so fine, 
With money that they saved up all the fall, 
Arrah won't they spend it freely we'll have 
a 
jolly time, 
When we're down at McCarthy's Fancy Ball. 
Whim the ball is over and you are going home, 
With your little darling by your side, 
It's a 
Mary, Kate, or Nellie that you are waltzing 
with. 
Hoping some day that she will be your bride, 
It's then you pop the question of course she 
answers yes, 
And tells you not to mention it at all. 
You go home quite light-hearted and blessing 
the nighb, 
That you were at McCarthy's Ball.

MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY, 
rye a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, - 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och ! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you don't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
41. 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus.

Where the crystal waters, softly onwardflows, 
And the little daisies, pure as Heaven's snows— 
Blossom in the meadows, where I 
often stray 
To meet that little fairy that comes at close of day. 
How I 
love to linger, and tell her o'er and o'er, 
That my heart adores her, loves her more and more; 
I 
could ne'er deceive her, never cause her pain; 
Shades of eyening hasten the meeting hour again. 
CHORUS. 
Meet me in the twilight, close beside the rill, 
Tell me, little darling, that you love me still ! 
If you'll only promise, ever to be true, 
I'll pass the pleasant hours in happy dreams of you. 
And I 
love her fondly, more than words can tell, 
And I 
often linger in the quiet dell; 
Then my little fairy, like a 
brilliant beam, 
Will dawn upon my vision, just like a 
pleasant dream. 
In the rosy twilight, we often then will stray, 
And she listens to me, to each word I 
say; 
And my vows are sacred, ever firm and true, 
Day and night I 
see thee, in happy dreams of you! 
Cho,us.
