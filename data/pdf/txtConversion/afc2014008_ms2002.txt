- the Festival of American Folklife
 A which i
s presented
 
pickers and a blues singer or two sitting
 
the Festival.  The general
 
it consists of a few banjo
 
under a tree somekhere in
 
Washington for a few days during the summer.
 Let me try to correct
 
that impression.
 
I
t is the largest outdoor festival devoted exclusively to
 
traditional arts in the world.
 Last summer, during the 10 day run of
 
the 1975 Festival, some 70,000 people attended it.  During the summer
 
of 1976 when the Festival, in celebration of the Bicentennial, will
 
last for 12 weeks, we will host some 800 traditional performers from
 
every part of the globeeach week (
that's 
IID overall ) and 
i
i
goodness
 
t
i
 
knows how many people will come to hear them.
 
The Festival is completely free.
 It is a serious educational
 
benefit of all citizens, and 
of the United States for the

Sunday), six or seven sound stages are in continuous operation between
 
the hours of 1
1 a
.m. and 5
:00 p
.m. with a two hour evening concert lasting
 
until 8
:00.  The people performing on those stages are all traditional
 
performers -
- s
inging, dancing, playing instruments.  No national ballet
 
no cost whatever.  Every day of the Festival week (
from Wednesday through
 
' S

.
 
companies or folkloricos are invited; the performers are individually
 
selected by Smithsonian field workers or by folklorists and/or ethno-
musicologists from the various foreign countries invited.
 
The Festival takes place along the side of the reflecting pool
 
which l
ies between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial,
 
under the trees.
 It is divided into a number of sections.  One of
 
them, Regional America, during the 12 weeks of the summer of 1976,
 
will present the traditional folkways to be found in the 50 states,
 
including Hawaii, Alaska, and, hopefully, American Samoa and the
 
Marshalls or the Marianas.
 In the Native American section, 60 Indian
 
crafts workers and musicians will each week present the art of a different
 
indigenous tribal area.  Working America brings traditional American
 
workingmens' folklore to the mall, each week stressing a different set
 
of industries and crafts.
 
Of perhaps the most interest to this society are the last two
 
major sections of the Festival -
-
 Old Ways in the New World and African
 
Diaspora.
 In Old Ways, the ethnic heritage of Americans is featured;
 
each week two different European or Asian countries are invited to send
 
a delegation of 25 of their traditional artists to celebrate on the mall
 
jointly with their American descendants, who are represented in equal
 
number.  African Diaspora mounts an even more complex program, bringing
 
in simultaneously performers from Black Africa, from the Black traditions
 
of Latin America and from the Black United States.  During the 1976
 
festival, these two programs together will import traditional musicians
 
and artists from 36 foreign countries.  A summer-long visit by any of your
 
students to the Festival would be the equivalent of -
-
 well, I won't guess
 
how many academic units -
-
 but I must point out the advantages of the fact
 
that our music and musicians are all alive and available for questions
 
and discussions.
 
From my own point of view -
-
 that of a person who
 
only recently joined the Festival staff -
-
 the most remarkable
 
thing about the entire enterprise i
s h± that it happens at all.
 
I
t is probably the most complex piece of cultural engineering
 
ever to have been undertaken by Americans,  and until quite
 
recently it was managed almost entirely by Ralph Rinzler,
 
the Festival director, and a literal handful of staff, almost
 
none of whom could be described as professionals in an academic
 
sense.
 Only this year have we obtained the fulltime services
 
of an ethnomusicologist, in the person of Tom Vennum and quite
 
recently also we have enlisted the aid of a number of &islixgxis
 
distinguished advisors:
 
Arensberg, Alan Lomax,
 
David McAllester, Al Ortiz, Conrad
 
.

Halim El Dabh,  among others.
 
The main reason the festival works,  in my opinion,
 
is because of what it does, rather
 
salutory lesson for an academic to
 
clear and simple and devastatingly
 
not because they are intrinsically
 
than who does it -
-
 a
 
learn.
 Its principles are
 
difficult to bring off,
 
so hard but because they
 
run exactly counter to so many powerful forces in contemporary
 
life.
 
The Festival is not show biz and it makes no con-
cessions to the forces of show biz.,\ It is not high culture
 
either and it makes no such pretensions.
 The Festival puts
 
its money into people rather than into things;  there are no
 
glass cases and very few photographs  -
-
 the people are there
 
in person.
 The Festival says that ordinary people, when
 
working within their own cultural tradition, produce
 
extraordinary art, and they are right there doing it in front
 
of you.
 Finally,  the Festival takes sides:  it i
s not
 
interested in o
1 c.et
 _
 ethnographic
 
truth, whatever that may be.
 It is not concerned with

The original charge to develop the Festival was
 
enunciated by S
.  Dillon Ripley, the present Secretary of
 
the Smithsonian, who took office in 1964.
 Prior to his
 
Secretaryship,  the Smithsonian had, of course, a long-time
 
commitment to ethnology, exemplified by the establishment
 
of the Bureau of Indian Ethnology in 1879 and such pioneer
 
recording efforts as those of Frances Densmore.
 During
 
Ripley's ten years of tenure, however,  the Institution took
 
on a major commitment to the establishment of N
iax outreach
 
programs, a serious attempt to break down the walls of the
 
museum and let the folks in, not only in Washington but across
 
the country.
 One of these outreach programs was the Folklife
 
Festival, designed, in Rjlpley's phrase to establish "an
 
outdoor l
iving museum on the Mall".
 The f
irst Festival took
 
place in 1
967; it has been presented annually ever since;
 
the biggest -
-
 and quite possibly the last -
-
 Festival will
 
occur next summer.
 
When you watch the films of the 1975 Festival which
 
Tom will presently be showing you,  I think you will be impressed
 
not only by the SxmmaxYasxYiaxi
axx extraordinary music of
 
the Soma Vesuvianna, but by the faces of the listening
 
audiences.
 I
've been to a lot of folk festivals in my day,
 
and I
've watched a lot of audiences in the process, but
 
these are a new experience for me.
 They are not there to
 
show off their clothes or to "get with it" or to "groove"
 
or any of the other catch phrases of the day.
 They are
 
-
'
 
interested, watchful, alert,  learning. 4  Though they look
 
just like Mr.  and Mrs. America and all the kids out for a
 
picnic, it is clear that these people are engaged in a
 
serious enterprise
 b
-
M
, stretching and enriching
 
their experience, f
inding out something new and extraordinary,
 
taking it all in.
 
Tom and I
,  a
s representatives of the Smithsonian,
 
hope that you will take our Festival equally seriously, as
 
an opportunity for education and learning on a truly massive
 
scale.
 We need your help, your expertise,  and your ideas.
 
And most of all, we hope that you and your students will come
 
and join us next summer on the mall.
 Whatever week you come,
 
we can promise m you that you will meet some 800 remarkable
 
traditional artists -
-
 craftspeople,  cooks, musicians, story
 
tellers  -
-
-
 and that you will come away refreshed and encouraged,
 
your faith in your discipline renewed.
