TO THE PUBLIC. 
In issuing for public appreciation the following collection of 
songs, I 
cannot let the opportunity slip of thanking my many 
patrons, who, at the critset of my career as a 
vocalist, and at 
a 
time when success or failure was a 
question, theoretically 
speaking, of life or death to me, for the kindness and consid— 
eration with which they judged my efforts to please. 
I 
am not 
so egotistical as to imagine I 
had no shortcomings, nor am I 
so vainglorious as to think that without their assistance I 
could, 
by the mere power of my talents, have won the position in my 
profession, which the applause I 
nightly gain tells me I 
have 
won. 
I 
am well aware that my friends and the public have 
treated me with the greatest forbearance; and I 
cannot let the 
present moment pass by without thanking them from my heart 
of hearts. 
Hoping they will receive this little volume with the 
same favor they have bestowed upon me in the past, allow me 
to subscribe myself 
the public's ever- favored servant,

THE FEN1ANS' ESCAPE. 
An original song of the escape of the Fenians' from Australia 
as written and sung by the great Irish Comedian and Vocalist 
JAMES O'NEIL. 
NOW boys if you will listen, to the story I'll relate, 
I'll tell you of the noble men, who from the foe escaped. 
Though bound with Saxon fetters, in the dark Australian jail, 
They struck a 
blow for freedom, and for Yankee land set sail. 
On the 17th of April last, the stars and stripes did fly, 
On board the bark Catalpa, waving proudly to the sky. 
She showed the green above the red, as she did calmly lay, 
Prepared to take the Fenian boys, in safety o'er the sea. 
When Breslin and brave Desmond, brought the prisoners to the 
shore, 
They gave one shout for freedom; soon to bless them ever more 
And manned by gallant hearts they pulled towards the Yankee 
flag, 
For well they knew from its proud folds, no tryant could them 
drag. 
They have nearly reached in safety the Catalpa, taut and trim, 
When fast approaching them they saw a 
vision dark and dim. 
It was the steamer " Georgette," and on her deck there stood., 
One hundred hired assassins, to shed each patriot's blood. 
The steamer reached the bounding bark, and fired across her 
bow, 
They in loud voice commanded, that the vessel should 
Heave 
to. ,, 
But noble Captain Anthony, in thunder tones did cry, 
You dare not fire a 
shot at that bright flag, that floats on high. 
My ship is sailing peacefully beneath that flag of stars, 
l'ts manned by Irish hearts of oak, and manly Yankee tars. 
And that dear emblem at the fore, so plain now to be seen, 
'Isis the banner I'll protect, old Ireland's flag of green. 
The Britisher he sailed away, from the stars and stripes he ran* 
He knew his chance was slim to fight, the boys of -Uncle Sam, 
So Hogan, Wilson, Harrington with Darragh off did go, 
With Hassett and b 
ad Cranston, soon to whip the Saxon foe. 
Here's luck to that noble captain, who well these men did free, 
He dared the English-man-of-war, to fight him on the sea. 
And here's to that dear emblem, which in triumph shall be seen 
The flag for which those patriots fought, dear Irelands' flag of.

"Oh," says he, " he lives on suction." "Is that so?" says I. 
Ye see he was givin' me a " kid," thinkin' I 
was a 
greenhorn. 
That's so," says he, smilin' all over like a 
basket av chips, 
"Well, thin," says I, " he must be well kept, for be Fleavea

The Lads Who Live in Ireland, 
OR, WHERE THE APPLE PRATIES GROW. 
As Sung by DAN NASH, the Great Character Artist. 
My name is Ned 0' ganney, I 
was born in sweet Kilarney, 
I 
can fight, dance or sing, I 
can plow, reap or mow; 
And if I 
meet a 
pretty girl, I 
Lever practice blarney. 
I've something more alluring, which perhaps you'd like to know; 
I'm none of your Bulgrucideries, nor other sh, bby families, 
But can unto my pedigree a 
pretty title show; 
Oh I 
I'm of the O's and Macs, and likewise the iturdy Whacks. 
CHORUS. 
That live and toil in Ireland. where the Apple Praties grow; 
That live and toil in Ireland, where the Apple Praties grow. 
I 
could a 
deal relate, if I 
could but trace my pedigree : 
My Mother was a 
Hogan. but my Father I 
don't know; 
I've nin ety-nine relations in a 
place they call Roscarberry, 
And each unto their name haea7 Mac or an 0; 
My Uncle was a 
Brallaghan, my Aunt she was a 
Callaghan; 
And as to my character, why, I 
can plainly show, 
I'm a 
rantin' rovin' blade, and I 
never was afraid, 
For I 
was born in Ireland, &c. 
May Heat en still protect our hospitable Country, 
Where first I 
drew my 
living breath, and heard its cocks to crow. 
Adieu to its green hills and its lovely Bay of Bantry ! 
Where many a 
pleasant evening, my love and I 
did go. 
Where shoals of fish, so pleasantly, did sport about so merrily, 
Beneath its glassy surface, their wanton tricks to slow, 
Oh I 
those scenes I 
did enjoy like a 
gay unthinking boy, 
With the lads who live in Ireland, & c. 
St. Patrick was our Saint, and a 
blessed man, in truth was he: 
Great gifts unto our Country he freely did bestow; 
He banished all the frogs and toads that sheltered in our Country. 
And unto other regions it's they were forced to go'; 
There is one fact undoubtedly, that cannot contradicted be; 
For, trace the Irish history, and it will plainly show: 
Search the universe all round, tighter fellows can't be found, 
Than the lads who live in Ireland, Sze.

BIDDIE DOYLE, 
As Sung by JAS. 
Ohl I 
have come over here, Biddie Doyle, 
For to tell you pretty clear, Biddie Doyle, 
For to gain your heart and hand, 
As you will understan d, 
And to be at your command, Biddie Doyle. 
So I 
will always prove true, 
No matter what you do, 
And I 
will stick to you like glue, Biddie Doyle. 
Ohl the summer is past and gone, Biddie Doyle, 
And the winter is coming on, Biddie Doyle; 
And the stormy winds will blow, 
it will hail, rain and Snow, 
And what will be, ome of you. Biddle Doyle. 
What will you do at all, 
When the snow begins to fall, 
With your back against the wall, Biddie Doyle. 
You know how it is yourself, Biddle Doyle, 
You will soon be on the shelf, B .ddie Doyle; 
You know you are old enough, 
And your face is getting much, 
Another year will make you tough, Biddie Doyle. 
So leave off your lamentation, 
And increase the population. 
Or you are not worthy of your nation, Biddie Doyle. 
Oh I 
when I 
go on a 
spree, Biddie Doyle, 
I 
will raise lots of fun, you'll see, Biddle Doyle; 
If I 
should come home tight, 
Don't try to raise a 
fight, 
Or I'll give you a 
box that wil I 
make you quiet, Biddie Doyle; 
Don't call the neighbors around me. 
Or if you do, j'll surely pound you, 
Aad I 
will spit on you and drown you, Biddie Doyle.

You I 
will surprise, 
Its of a 
charmer I

Whom I 
thought a

Her eyes were dark and gentle, 
And I 
loved her dearer than gold, 
But after a 
year of married life 
How badly I 
was sold.

Providing I

Oh give me gin or whiskey, 
Or old Jamaica rum, 
For since I 
married this beauty, 
I've turned out a 
regular bum. 
When our love was young and gay, 
How sweet I 
thought her glance. 
I'd place my arm around her waist 
As we went through the mazy dance. 
Around and around we'd go 
Mid the multitude so large, 
Oh how lovely it did seem, 
While waltzing on the barge.

MULDOON'S PARTY. 
Sung by JAMES O'NEIL. 
It was last week Muldoon gave a 
party, 
The gang in great numbers were stuffs, 
When O'Reilly, N. G., and McCarty 
Sung an Irish song called the " Two Toughs." 
Pete DooIan was lush and got cranky, 
And swore he saw " blood on the moon." 
When Mulcahy's Irish got worked up, 
And knocked the tar out of Muldoon. 
SPOKEN.—Ye's talk about good-look in' girls! there was Mui• 
cahy's sick daughter; she was as party as a 
pig I And the 
whiskey—they use it on the Boulevard to blast rocks with! 
O'Relley's wife asked me to dance a 
reel with her—I 
got a 
breeze from her breath and I 
reeled on the floor. 
CHORUS. 
But here is.success to the party, 
The Clipper then tapped a 
fresh keg, 
The bung hit Miss Eugene McCarty, 
And she danced the cancan on one leg. 
When the music struck up I 
got crazy. 
The gang made a 
rush for to dance, 
Said Muldoon to O'Reiley, " be aisy, 
For he's got on his tra-la-lee pants." 
" 
Ile is look-in' for graft" said McCarty, 
" 
Throw him out" said a 
cherry faced bloke, 
" 
He is too fresh" and the girls they laughed hearty, 
And O'Malley said " go stab the coat!" 
SPOKEN." Here," said I 
to Muldoon, " I'm no Italian, and 
I'll have no more of it; I 
came here to enjoy myself. 
Said 
O'Reilly--" they're only givin' you a 
guy," " I'm no sailor." 
21 
tvery mother's son now take a 
skip, 
I 
see that you're all on the guy, 
For I'm bound to hold on to my grip, 
And danced 'round the room like a 
fly. 
The gang, nearly starved, made a 
rush, 
For the table they made very quick, 
There was pigs' feet, red herrin's and mush, 
Be the Heavens they made it look sick. 
O'Malley filled up on red lierrin's, 
Whin they carried him out nearly dead. 
0' Reilly's sick daughter she fainted, 
And was carried in pieces to bed. 
SPOLEN.—Tes, they all commenced looking for fight, and 
their brains were crazed with whiskey. 
Chairs, tables, stove-
pipes and lamps were flyin' around the room, which broke up 
the party. 
I 
bid Muldoon good-night, and went home. 
All the next day I 
laid in me bed, 
With a 
plaster stuck under my chin, 
And an iron hoop bound round me head 
To keep down the whiskey and gin!

And the roof lets iu the sunshine and the rain,

liurrah! For the Blue and. the Gray! 
Sung with great success, by GEORGE HARRIS, the 
Great Centennial Vocalist. 
AIR. —" Minstrel Band." 
Why need we now fear of danger that's near, 
Prepared as we are for the fray: 
In triumph we stand as the Kings of the land, 
Since united, the Blue and the Gray! 
What means that shout coming nearer and nearer, 
Our Nation can never decay; 
Our sons shall go forth from the South and the North; 
Hurrah ! for the Blue and the Gray; 
Then Hurrah! then Hurrah! 
Hurrah for the Blue and the Gray. 
since Washington spoke, and our strong fetters broke, 
When he drove back the foe in dismay, 
Nor a 
traitor that tried, or our bright stars defied. 
But " gave in " to the Blue and the Gray. 
I 
hear sweet Freedom shouting, shouting, 
Never to a 
tyrant give way, 
Your banner on high, it shall float to the sky! 
Hurrah! for the Blue and the Gray. 
Then hurrah! &c. &c. 
But soft, let us mourn for a 
soldier now gone; 
For his country he gave up his breath, 
And cursed be the blow from the wild Indian foe, . 
When the golden haired Chief met his death. 
I 
hear the angels weeping, weeping, 
In sorrow each voice seems to say, 
Brave Custer! he died as the foe he defied, 
In his charge with the Blue and the Gray. 
Then Hurrah! &c. &c.

By M ATT. M CARNY. 
Sung by ED. SCULLY. 
The noisy streets are supremely green, 
Aid all the clans are in order ; 
A 
thousand wavin1;,,, 
flags are seen, 
And each has green for its border. 
Arrah ! But the land is all ablaze, 
The bells have sounded their warning, 
And the only time the wide world plays 
" 
St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Each lad appears all neatly dressed--
No monarch ever was bolder--
With a 
spray of shamrock in his breast 
And a 
sash thrown over his shoulder ; 
And the lass she smiles upon the lad, 
And turns no more in her scorning, 
For she could'nt resist his suit, bedad, 
On " St, Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
Och ! sure, but the streets are a 
gala sight, 
The people arc all so frisky ! 
With here and tic re a 
bit of a 
tight, 
The result of a 
drop of whiskey ! 
If Mike and Pat come out of a 
spat 
With eyes of their own adorning, 
Divil a 
bit do they care for that, 
On " St. Patrick's Day in the Morning." 
You may traverse the world from Northern main, 
To the line of the hot equator : 
You may go from Sahara's desert plain, 
To Vesuvius, close to the crater ; 
You are certain to find an Irishman there, 
If you come with never a 
warning. 
And he's sure to be lumuning the darling air 
Of " t. 
Patrick's day in. the Morning !" 
But though you find him in distant parts, 
And whether at sea or on dry land, 
The tenderest spot in his heart of hearts 
Is reserved for the Emerald Island. 
The soil of his birth is his proudest boast, 
And he'll give you it wack for a 
warning, 
If you fail to respond to his patriot boast

So I 
will wait awhile, 
Until Terry does come in ; 
And I'll show him the pledge, 
And a 
new life then. I'll begin. 
I'll no longer let him abuse me, 
Nor I'll not put up with his slang; 
But I'll try to do all I 
possibly can, 
For to make him leave that gang. 
But I 
will have to, ko.,

HILDERBRANT McGUFFIN. 
Written and sung by JOHN D. 
Giums, the Popular Irish 
Comedian. 
Here I 
am, an Irishman, 
As you can plainly see; 
I 
just came over from Ireland, 
From the county of Tralle. 
When I 
landed in Castle Garden, 
On America's soil to tread, 
I 
was met by a 
fair haired maiden, 
And this is what she said— 
Cnorms. 
Tra-ls, la ! Tra-la.-le! I'll meet you pet, 
I'll meet you in the Park when the weather it is wet ; 
I'll strike you with a 
Turkey-leg, I'll smother you with the 
stuffing; 
For the darling of the ladies is Hilderbrant McGuffin. 
Oh! when I 
was married about a 
year, 
I 
found to my great joy, 
My wife she made me a 
present 
Of a 
darling, bouncing boy; 
And when at night he'd holler for his Paregoric, 
Or any such thing, 
My wife she'd dance him up and down, 
And this is what she'd sing— 
Tra-la-la, Szc.

COME all you tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
'Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I 
went 
through,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of 
the Bugaboo. 
['Repeat 
Te day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape 
never shall, 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead, for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
rRepecte, 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plow the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the Cap-
tain of the Bugaboo._

We sailed three years when" storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark 
blue sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he 
set fire to the Bugaboo. 
['Repeat. 
When the )aptain found what he had done, he loud for help 
did shout, 
He called up through the chimney top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out: 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so hard through the middle of the turf, 
they could'nt save the Bugaboo.

When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it could'ut burn

DISSOLVING VIEWS. 
PATRICK'S DAY PARADE, 
Composed and sung by GEORGE HARRIS. 
Arm — Castles in the Air. 
While thinking of some past events at home the other night, 
Seated.at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last the fire, began to fade—a 
shadow o'erit grew ; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking'at some great dissolving view; 
Some views there were that gave me joy, while others gave 
me pain ; 
Oh! may I 
never see them in reality again ; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my 
great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case; 
The family of a 
workingman. hunger stared them in the face 
The mother and their children gather'd round a 
scanty fire, 
The last sparks even threatening every moment to expire; 
At last the father enters, and hangs his honest head, 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread, 
Though honest, he is forced to steal and into jail he's threw; 
This sad and truthful picture is my 
second dissolving view. 
The next was a 
police court; two prisoners in were led ; 
One, a 
well-dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill-fed; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat. 
He said, " lam an orphan boy, and nothing had to eat; 
Three months hard labor was his doom—the tears ran 
down his face; 
While he who swindled many a 
man walked out with a 
good grace; 
He paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him 
through— 
That ends the case, and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tragic one, I'm sure ; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin, dastardly and cold! 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm 
told; 
The murder of Jim Fisk, I 
mean, a 
man known to you all. 
In this wide world he played his part. and rolling kept the 
ball: 
I 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
Ever more to rest in peace, in this dissolving view.

THE Lord bless you all, I've just come out to have a 
little chat; 
I'm Irish sure, but that's no sin, I'm a 
rollicking, merry Pat. 
The ladies' hearts I

For her neck is white and her step is light, and her teeth at

There is none so gay by night or day, as Kitty, the Wicklow Girl, 
Her fortune, faith, it is but small, to him who wins her hand, 
But her heart is pure, and that's worth all the diamonds in the 
land; 
If my pockets they were lined with gold, like any great lord or

THE GOAT. 
NOW my dear friends, I'm going to relate, 
Hyou pay attention, you've not long to wait; 
My father lived In a 
place called Gm mote, 
He had a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This goat, sure, he had a 
queer, curious way, 
he'd go out every morning and stop out all day; 
When he'd come home at night, like a 
bull he would roar, 
'Till my father gets up for to open the door. 
One day we sat down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the mate, 
And without saying a 
word, shure the dirty ould gommagb, 
lie drily his two horns in me poor fathers stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamsey," " Yis » min," says I, 
" 
Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the 
oat, gave a 
jump, 
And sthruck me mother, oh gorra! such a 
murthering thurup„ 
Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrate, 
And the goat backed away at the divil's own rate; 
lie spied my father's coat hanging, he gave a 
loud bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," and dripy his head in the wall. 
5ome time afther they went to look for th goat, 
They searched all around, ' till they came to the coat. 
All of the goat that was left on the very ...ext day, 
Was only the sthump WI* 
tail, and it still bucking away.

MULCAHY'S GONE AWAY. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1874 by E. Il. 
HARDING, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Words and Music by Joseph P. SKELLY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. 
H HARDING, 288 Bowery,.

Price 10 cents. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH, the Irish Comic, and DR. Its, 
L. THAYER, the greatest Clown of the Northwest-
The Hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man. 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan ; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
gure he left them all, and now they cry, 
NuLeahy's gone away! 
CHORUS. 
He was great ad graud, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away ! 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too ! 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And nor be's gone away! 
He was great. 
1 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
But ere he came to rule the town, 
His mini was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, as 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair ; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say ; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, Se. 
Re treated us like gintlemen 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good., 
From his head down to his feet; 
Ile wore a 
collar stiff and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man,. 
But now he's gone away ! 
He was great, M. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this clarlin' man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all? 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, Az.

The N. Y. Evening Atoll writes: , 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FISHER'S, OS Nas-
sau street ca led the ' Little Fiirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young iady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the had habit of " flirting." 
Unfertunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining" how. when and 
toliere to do it." and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Eeening Telegram, writes: " We have lately seen a neat litlls 
book, bound in Morocco leather, co-ting twenia,•-tive cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. F.snEit, lo. 9:s Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modus cp , randi of flitting, anti c! the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do i 
at hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-

These Cards are ars . nged and printed in series—Hsarts, Clubs Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters ha relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

Courting Cat rds.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too din. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from dotng anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been pro.onged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own. unless it accords with 
the state of their affection-, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but 
may be enjoyed by evening parties
