"Italian-ness" in the Walla Walla Valley is derived from several 
factors. First is the persistence of Italian--American-owned 
horticulture, especially of "Walla Walla Sweet" onions, and the 
dominance of "Walla Walla Sweet" production, packing, and 
distribution by the Walla Walla Gardeners Association (WWGA). 
Second is the revival of Italian ethnic-consciousness since 1`376, 
most recently centered on the Italian Heritage Association (IHA) 
and the annual Italian Heritage Days celebration in October. This 
has come as part of a mainstream acceptance of cultural pluralism 
and historical nostalgia, especially that associated with the 
Bicentennial and the Rggjq phenomenon. It has engendered a 
newfound sense of history among Walla Walla Valley Italian-
Americans, which further strengthens a sense of identity. A sense 
of "Italian-ness" in the Valley also comes from the persistence 
of Italian foods in some families. This persistence seems to be, 
at least in part, separate from the mainstream popularity of 
southern Italian-derived Italian-American foods. 
WW Its.' livelihood reflected and still reflects the phenomenon 
of what David L. Ni.candri calls "the agrarian townsman," i,e,, 
the small-scale farmer living on the outskirts of town and 
2 
providing the town with fresh produce. According to Nir_andri, in 
his book ltal.ian _in_ W•1 >hi.n•tan_at•lte: Emilration, 1853_I924 
(Tacoma: WA. State American Revolution Bicentennial. Committee, 
1979. I_CCN 77•-81592. LC Call# 1=900 .I8N5), pp. 5G-60, many of the 
Northwest's It. settlers became true, gardeners on the outskirts 
of cities. 
WW is a small city of 25,618, located in southeastern Washington 
State, about four miles north of the Oregon state line. It is 
situated in a valley, drained by the Walla Walla River and 
several tributary creeks. It was founded in 1862, and is one of 
the oldest U.S. settlements in WA. 
Near WW were the Oregon Trail. 
and Marcus & Narcissa Whitman's Wailatpu Mission. To the east are 
the northern Blue Mountains, including part of the Umatilla 
National Forest and the Wenaha•-Tucannon Wilderness. To the south 
is Oregon, the town of Milton-Freewater, OR., and more Blue 
Mountains. The area to the south is mostly orchards as soon as 
you cross into Oregon. To the southwest, sharing city limits, 
it; 
the City of College Place, pop. 3,771, founded 1882. To the north 
and west are enormous hilly winter wheat fields, owned by "wheat-
ranchers," many of them of German--Russian background. In the 
valley its elf are wheat fields, truck gardens, and some pasture. 
The name, WW, which has also been used to denote a local Indian 
tribe, means "many waters," as do Wailatpu, Wallula, and Wallowa, 
three other nearby place- names. 
3 
Early settlers were Anglos, Chinese, and French-Canadians. Later 
settlers were German-Russians, Irish, Italians, and 
Scandinavians. Still later Mexican and Hispanic-Americans have 
settled in the valley. Therm are many retired people in WW, 
including some who have settled there from elsewhere. 
WW is the seat of WW County, pop. 47,435. College Place is the 
home of Walla Walla College (Seventh Day Adventist). The only 
other towns in WW Co. are Prescott and Waitsburg. Other small 
communities in WW County include Attalia, Ayer, Burbank, Clyde, 
Dixie, Eureka, Kooskooskie, Lowden, Page, Pleasant View, Rul.o, 
Sudbury, Touchet, and Wallula. WW Co. includes a small portion of 
Umatilla Nat'l Forest. WW Co. 
is bounded on the west by the 
Columbia River and the north by the Snake River. 
Walla Walla is the home of private* Whitman College and state 
Walla Walla Community College. WW is the home of the WA. State 
Penitentiary (with both maximum and medium security plants). The 
chief employers in the county are the Iowa Beef Co., which 
operates a packing plant in Wallula, on the Columbia River, ca. 
thirty miles west of WW; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which 
operates dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers, and a regional 
headquarters and maintenance division in WW; the prison; a 
Continental. Can Co. plant; a Eloise-Cascade pulp mill in Wallula; 
and the local irrigation district.

Milton•-Freewater, pop. x;,086, 
is the only Oregonian town in the 
WW Valley. It is located in northern Umatilla County, and is 
surrounded to the south by the Blue and Wallowa Mountains. Other 
,mall OR. WW Valley communities are Barrett, Statel.ine, and 
Umapine. 
The nearest medium-sized city is Spokane, WA., 
(171,300) 
about 
160 miles northeast. Nearby small cities are Lewiston, ID.-
Clarkston, WA., about ninety miles, and Pendleton, OR., and Tri.-
Cities (Kennewick--Fusco-Richland), WA. each about fifty miles 
from WW. I-84 is about 50 miles south. I-8P, which connects via 
1-90 to Seattle, is about fifty miles west. Thera are ?74 miles 
from WW to Seattle, I--5 and the old U.S. Rte. 97 and 262 miles to 
Portland. U.S. Rte. 12 and the Burlington-Northern Railroad pass

THE REMEMBERED PAST 
As with many American ethnic groups that have a history going 
back to pioneer days, especially among those who have had a 
recent revival of ethnic foregrounding, remembered early history 
of the community functions as etiological legend. Although many 
5 
or even most WW ItAms strongly assimilated and often denied their 
heritage, recent revivals of both ethnic- and historic-
consciousness have had considerable im pact on loca l "folk 
history" and its identity-gende•ring function. 
Families that have 
collections of historical and early family photos, such as the 
Locatis, the Paiettas, the Satu•rnos/Dreaens, and the Christianos, 
thus hold an almost "sacred trust" within the community. 
Joe J. 
Locati is a retired Stater and Federal produce inspector 
and the leading historian of both the Italian community and of 
the horticulture industry and descendant of a leading grower 
family. Details of the history of Italian-American horticulture 
in the WW Valley are covered in his book, ThE••Ficartiru7.tur G11 
µIiF•rit s 3c•_c•f_W<all<a_Wall _CraLtntY,•_1t•1F3-].` ;T7 
(WW, WA.: Privately 
Published by Joe J. Locati, 2 editions. 1978, G19797. LCCN 77-
091265. LC CallH SP 319.2 . 
W2L63) , Chapters III 
(pp. 
33•-49) and 
VII (pp. 93-143) . It is the definitive work on the history of 
both horticulture and Italians in WW County. Locati, although a 
member of WW IHA, dismisses it as "a bit of n ostalgia, " and 
maintains that there is no genuine Italian ethnic pride in the 
Valley. There is little doubt that Italians and people of Italian 
ancestry have not been considered "Americans " in the Valley, 
until recently, despite them having been in the Valley since the 
mid-19th century. Many Italians and Italian-Americans took 
Anglicized names, including the Saturnos, changed to B•reens>, 
probably the leading Italian pioneer horticulturist family. 
G 
However, there had to have been a considerable amount of Italian 
pride there in the 1910s, as Walla Walla claims to have had the 
first Columbus statue and the first Columbus Day parades in the 
Northwest, if not the entire West Coast. 
Most Italians in the Valley arrived between 1900 and 1925. 
Settlement seems to have been spurred by the efforts of a few 
earlier Italian settlers, particularly Pasquale and Maria Saturno 
(or Satorno or Sotorno, later known as Frank Breen) , Joe Tach i, 
Luigi Rizzuti and his wife and son, and Tony Locati. The Saturnos 
were from the island of Ischia near Naples, The Locatis and Tachi 
were from Lombardy, near Milan. 
(Tachi's wife Antonia was 
southern Italian. This anomaly is not explained.) fizzuti and his 
wife and son were from the southernmost part of Italy, presumably 
Calabria. 
About equal numbers of Northern and Southern Italians eventually 
settled in the Valley. Most of the northerners came from the 
west-of-Milan suburb, Lonate Pozzolo, from Caravaggio, or from 
the shares of Lago Maggiore, and they were locally known as 
"Milanese," and on the stained-glass window of St. Francis of 
Assisi R.C. Church, "the Northern Colony." The southerners came 
from Calabria, Basilicata, Campania, Puglia, and Sicily, but were 
collectively known, among other Italians, as "Calabrese." The 
opposite church window called them "the Southern Colony." As was 
the case almost everywhere in the U.S. where Italians settled, 
7 
the first settlers established themselves and than they sponsored 
the immigration of subsequent relati ves and pygypni.. 
I_onate Pozzolo's con tribution to the It. population in the WW 
Valley is suffici ent to have made on impression on the Lonatese 
of today. There is an elaborate locally published coffee-table 
book, titled Lariat+_F'n_z.7ca7.ra_•atcyri, _f•rte•_c?cie•:a, co- ordi.nated 
by UiF•rancio De•rtolli, Elis>a Bottia, R Ri.no Ga•ratti.. 
(Lonate 
Pozzol.o: Nicolini Edito•re, 1985). In it is a chapter, 
"L'Espe•rienza Lonatese nelli. Americhe," by Ernesto Milani. 
(pp. 
361-372) . In the chapter are three pages pertaining to Walla 
Walla, including a reproduction of a photo of twenty--one Its. 
gathered at Tony Locati's house on a Sunday afternoon in 1.91.0 to 
play bocc2, and a photo of "Walla Walla sweet" onions. 
In the 
English-language supplement to the book CLonatEwr_F'clxzc•7.oW 
fii. >Lc•ry 
Art,  Society_. 19£36), 
in the chapter "The Lonatese Experience in 
America," section "Lonatese Pioneers in Walla Walla" (pp. 22-25), 
the author speaks of Lonatese who found their way to a "faraway 
place in the magical West, with the attracting name of Walla 
Walla" (p. 22) . Most of the Lonatese emigrants discussed in the 
book did, however, go to California or Argentina. 
Until the middle of this century, Northerners and Southerners 
kept apart socially, and few intermarried. A sense of they 
supposed difference in temperament between Northerners and 
So utherners was explained to me by several informants. Words used 
8 
to describer Northerners include practical, reserved, business-
like, even "Germanic") and Southerners (sociable, carefree, gay 
Cin the old sense of the word_l, musical, also shiftless). 
Why Italians came to WW in the first place is still a mystery. A 
discharged U.S. Army veteran, Frank Orsel.li., originally from 
Lucca, had settled there in the 1852 and he became an orchardman 
(specializing in grapes) and a baker. After his death in 1894, 
his family left the area, and there is no evidence that he 
brought other Italians to the area. None of the three women he 
married were Italian. 
The next Italians were Saturno/Dreern and his wife, Maria, in 1875 
(or ••-6, 
or -8, depending on the source), a f=rank Villa (a 
Genovese who seems to have had little lasting impact) in 178, the 
Tachis in 180 , and Locati (brought by Tachi) in 186. 
(Locati 
brought his wife, Caterina, and a baby, over from Lonate Pozzolo 
in 1900,, after having returned to Italy for four years.) 
It was 
Saturno/preen, Tachi, and Locati who started the influx of 
relatives and pggnjni. 
Hearsay has it that Saturno had worked on the railroad in Texas 
before coming to WW, and that he may have come to WW as a 
railroad--worker, as did a number of subsequent Italians, well 
into the Goth century. The WW Valley has a relatively mild 
climate for the inland Northwest, and its soil is well--suited for 
9 
o•rcha•rd•ry and horticulture. However, the pioneer Italians had not 
been farmers or horticulturists in Italy. Saturno/I•r•reen had been 
a fisherman, and most of the other mean were la borers, some of 
whom had reputedly worked on Alpine railroad tunnels in 
Switzerland and France. 
There is much speculation among WW It- 
Ams. about these matters. Even more surprising is the fact that 
Its. 
in WW dial not pursue building or construction trades, and 
that when they arrived, much of the horticulture was dominated by 
Chinese. 
Most of the immigrants worked as farm laborers for their 
sponsors, eventually saving enough to purchase their own plots. 
The Saturno /Preens, Tach is, 
and Locatis became quite wealthy as 
growers and landowners. Hearsay has it that at least a social 
form of the old country's P1d•rcaDR system survived in the New 
World, and that at least the Saturnos/Preens and Tachi.s:i were 
respected and feared as 
adroni. 
Carl.y settlement is explored in 
detail in I_ocati's The Iiortit ul.lural i]c?ri t3•-'_g pp. 
33..-49 and pp. 
`3;3•-10`3. 
The prejudice against Its., especially in the schools, may have 
been a factor in their successful effort in 1910--11 to endow, by 
subscription, a statue of Christopher Columbus on the lawn of the 
Walla Walla County Court House on W. Main St. 
An It. 
barber, 
Frank Yu se (who knows what his •real. 
It. name was?) , with the help 
of Joe •T"achi and an It. deputy sheriff, Sam Curcio, went to the 
10 
leading Its. 
in the area and signed up the Satu•rno s/Dreens, the 
Fazza•ris, the Rizzutis, the Locati.s, and others, and eventually 
several dozen more Its. and ItAms. as contributors. Yuse trained 
an It. 
immigrant barber Tony Ambrose, who still lives west of WW 
and is now 91 years old, and Ambrose remembers both the 
subscription-drive and the parade. 
On Columbus Day, 1911, the statue, which was commissioned to be 
sculpted 
" back east," and set on a pedestal made by a WW monument 
company, was dedicated, and a large Columbus Day parade occurred, 
with units from the Army's Fort Walla Wa lla, Knights of Columbus, 
and participants from Spokane and elsewhere, all. participating. 
Most Washingtonians agree that it was the first Columbus statue 
in the state. Local lore has it that it was also the first 
Columbus Day parade and celebration in the state, and some 
believe it to be the first in the West, although that is 
doubtful.. The It-Ams. held Columbus Day celebrations at the 
statue during subsequent years in the 1910s, but the practice 
died out, not to be revived until the 1970s.

Arriving It. immigrants were, of course, Catholics, but few 
attended the established St. Vincent's F.C. Church. Some say it 
was clue to prejudice on the part of non-It. Catholics. Another 
possibility is that the Irish--Tansenist-led Church was rejected 
I1 
by the Its. themselves. In 1914, the Bishop of Spokane appointed 
Fr. Oscar R. Balducci, a Pisan, chaplain to they local Catholic 
hospital and missionary priest to the It. community. By 1915, the 
It. community had collected enough funds to guild a church, St. 
Francis of Assisi, on W. Alder St. 
in WW. To this day, it is 
still a missionary church, rather than a parish church. Fr. 
Balducci served through 1935 and died in 1937. He was St,. 
F. of 
A.'s last It. 
priest. None of his successors have even been ItAm. 
At the time of the field research for this project (1989), the 
pastor was Fr. Adrian Van der Hei. jdean, a native:' of the 
Netherlands.

I_ocati's:> book, which is how it is pronounced.) Fr. Van der

and some in College Place are Seventh Day Adventist. 
it. 
religious history is discussed in Locati., 
pp. 
121--6. 
The Walla Walla Gardeners Association was established in 1916 as 
an Italian growers' co--operative. 
Low prices during the early 
1910s and a sense that the non-Italian packing houses were 
cheating the It. 
growers, many of whom were illiterate, at least 
in English, led to its founding. All but one member are to this 
day at least part Italian-American, despite its having changed 
from a co-operative to a stockholder..-owned corporation, which was 
12 
done in the 1.980s to give retirees returns on their investment 
in the operation. Not only did they pack and ship vegetables, but 
they also sold supplies, equipment, and food, including bulk 
rice, to Northern and bulk pasta, to Southern members to feed 
their large families. Members could buy on credit against future 
delivery of crops. 
WWGA also bought carloads of grapes from 
California for its home-wznemaking members, swaying them costs. 
The WWGA also served as a mutual aid society. From her childhood, 
Carrie Locati C•riscola remembers them purchasing lumber for her 
family when they lost a house to a fire. From 191.6 to 1986, they 
were the only lasting Italian organization in the Walla Walla 
Valley, other than St. Francis of Assisi Church. See Locati., 
pp. 
1.10-20. 
Sevea•ral people have mentioned that during the 1910s, there was 
briefly a local It. lodge, called something .like "C•ristofo•ro 
Colombo Knights," but separate from the Knights of Columbus. I 
have no hard evidence of this. I do know that there has never 
been a Sons of Italy lodge in WW. When the IHA was established in 
the 1980s, the Spokane lodge of the Sons tried to recruit them as 
a WW lodge, but this was voted down by the membership. According 
to Ni.cand•ri, Frank. Yuse organized a Walla Walla Italian 
Workingmen's Club, but there seems to be little or no information 
about it. There was also briefly an It. marching band in WW 
during the 1920s. 
13 
GEOGRAPHY 
WW Valley's Its. settled primarily in two areas. Most of the, 
Northerners or "Milanese" (and Saturno) settled in an area 
straddling the western city limits of the City of Walla Walla, 
the northern city limits of the City of College Place, and west 
county areas in between. It is often called "the Blalock area.'' 
Most of this land had been part of the Blalock Orchards, 
purchased from the estate of pioneer physician and land-
developer, N.G. Blalock. 
(Blalock endowed Walla Walla College, a 
Seventh Day Adventist four--year institution located south of the 
orchards, in College Place, whose name is derived from it.) 
Italian families still talk of clearing the trees, and of the 
deep mulch that: the trees' leaves and roots left. Much of the 
land is sti.l.l awned by ItRms. , as can be wren by reading Rural. 
Route mailbox-names a.long Wa.11ula Rd., the west end of W. Rose 
St., Blalock Ave., Hussey St., Electric Ave., and the north ends 
of N. College and Larch fives., and Myra Rd., and on adjoining 
side streets. These:' holdings tend to be small, and today most are 
gardened by retired or semi-retired ItAm. onion- and asparagus-
growers. Many have been infected by an anion--destroying fungus, 
"white rot." Some of these, such as the Guglielmellis', are now 
turf--farms, and others are planted with tiny plats of wheat. 
Most of the Southerners (or "Calabrese") settled in an area 
14 
straddling the south end of College Place, the southwestern city 
limits of Walla Walla and southeastern city limits of College 
Place and in the YellowhGawk, Cotton, and Russell Creek Valleys 
between the two towns and the Oregon state line.These plots were 
eventually consolidated and there are now fewer Italians (or any 
farmers) there than in "Blalock." The larger ItAm. farms, such as 
Bossini.s' and Vintis' , are there now. Driving along Plaza Way, 
Dalles Military Rd., Braden Rd., Lower Milton Fed., 
and S. College 
Ave., Italian mailbox-names still prevail. Because S. 9th Ave. 
leads from downtown WW to this area, it is often called "the 
South Ninth area," and because of the presence of the former 
Braden School, it is sometimes called "the Braden area. 
This was 
a public school, which once had a sufficiently large It. & ItAm. 
student-body to be nicknamed "the Italian school." The building 
is still there. It is now a Church of God, Seventh Day. 
Although the WW Valley extends well into Umatilla County, Oregon, 
almost no Italians seem to have settled south of the state line. 
Several 
S. 
9th area" growers own or rent land on the Oregon 
side, though, and "WW Sweets" are grown there, too. A Genovese 
family of fruit-growers, the Pesciall.oss, 
dial, however settle in 
Umatilla Co., west of Milton-Freewate•r, near the hamlet of 
Barrett. They later became a leading source of wine grapes and 
wi.nemaking knowledge for their Walla Walla County, WA. landsmen. 
Northern Umatilla County is thickly planted in ditch-irrigated 
orchards, and one Can '.see a distinct difference in the 
15 
agricultural landscape as !soon as one crosses the state lane. 
•The WW Valley consistently has •t:he mildest climate in Washington 
east of the Cascades. It is in the form of a basin cradled to the 
west: and south by the Blue Mountains, which make a beautiful 
backdrop against the flat WW Valley landscape, especially when 
•t:hey a•re snow--covered. The Valley is, however, given to sudden 
extreme cold snaps every few years or so, which can be extremely 
damming to crops in the ground, especially when they a•re not 
covered by a layer of snow. The .last of these was in 1=eb•ruary 
1989. 
The volcanic soil is deep and fertile, much like the 
Palouse to its northeast, which makes it excellent agricultural. 
and ho•rticultu•ral. land. 
ItAm. growers claim •than it is the bust 
possible land for such •root crops as ca•r•rots. They also claim 
that its high sulfur--content is what makes it ideal fo•r onion-
growing. 
Locati gives a detailed history of WW County's various fruit and 
vegetable crops, both those •raised by Its. and non-Its, pp. 56--
92, and vegetables, pp. 
110-•c0, 
1G3-230. 
F"•rui.t came first, and 
was dominated by Angl.o•-Ams. such as Blalock.. A few Its. were also 
involved, such as the fi.•rst It. 
settl.e•r, Orselli, and the 
Genovese Pesciallos on the Oregon side. Vegetables were first 
dominated by Chinese and Japanese, and eventually by Its. Again, 
•the turn to commercial gardening as the economic basis fo•r Its. 
is something of a mystery. Informants agree that in the old 
IG 
country, this was not the case. Most explain it as being the only 
opportunity available. This may be so, 
but seems incomplete. 
Perhaps it is mere chance that Ischian fisherman Saturno/Breen 
tool: up gardening, perhaps not a well-respected living since it 
was dominated by Asians. Milanese Tachi and Calabrese Luigi 
Ri.zzuti obviously did the same. They then brought their relatives 
and pItnIni over as farm laborers (which many of them certainly 
had been in Italy) and set them to work on commercial vegetable— 
growing, which they then learned and could pursue independently, 
once they could purchase land of their own. 
THE CROP, 
As in many communities in the West, specialized crops were the 
niche in the economy which Its. dominated. To some extant this is 
sill true in the WW Valley. Most visible?, of course, is the 
"Walla Walla sweet" onion, but it became predominant somewhat 
later. In the early days, root- and bunch--crops of various kinds 
were the Its.' source of cash. Probably all It. 
families raised 
their own subsistence? Gardens. Home vegetable gardens are still a 
source of pride, especially among the alder Its., but also among 
the younger. 
Locati's TQq_Uprti,gU tu'ral Heritjgg discusses the various crops, 
pp. IG3-230. Interviews refer repeatedly to "bunch crops" or 
"bunch stuff," i., , vegetables sold in tied bunches, such as 
carrots, rhubarb, celery, spinach, green onions, and asparagus. 
17 
Locati lists the historically most important crops, other than 
onions, as spinach, rhubarb, asparagus, lettuce, carrots, 
cabbage, potatoes, sweet Corn, and green peas. Interviews refer 
to peddling early in this century. Pasquale Saturno/Frank Breen 
first marketed his crops as a peddler, and a persistent legend 
states that his Anglicized name comes from this. Joe J. Locati 
and several others claim that Saturno would say, 
"I breeng-a you 
this, I breeng•-a you that," or even "I breen-a you...," thus 
giving him the nickname "Breen." "F-rank" was evidently a generic 
nickname for 
It. men, like "Joe" or "Tony" in other places. 
Saturno/Breen's obituaries in the local press stated, "Frank 
Breen, Italian Pioneer Dies," and his impressive mausoleum in the 
Catholic section of Mountain View Cemetery has both "Saturno" and 
"Breen" on it. 
The early landowners, such as Saturno/Breen, Tony Locati, and 
Tachi, first employed the newcomers as farm laborers to pay off 
passage debt, then as hired hands, and eventually rented them 
land. Still later, when they had collected enough capital., the 
newcomers bought their own crops, sometimes from the Blalock 
estate, sometimes from the earlier immigrants. Some kind of 
social pj rgpq--like system continued in the WW Valley, with great 
deference and respect paid to such individuals as Saturno/Breen, 
Locati, and Tachi. 
Interviews and L_ocati.'s book (especially pp. 
163-194) suggest 
18 
that the crops varied far more in the earlier days. A number of 
factors eventually led to the onion--dominated specialization of 
today. These include the big food chains' resort to wholesale 
suppliers who preferred crops from warm areas like California and 
Texas, which were consistently available over a much longer 
season. The Older packing houses also closed inefficient plants 
in the area during the 1750s and 1960s, limiting the market. Farm 
labor, which had by mid-century .largely become dominated by 
migrant Mexicans and Hispanic-Americans, became more expensive as 
laws mandating their better pay and treatment were adopted. 
U r 
igati.on became dominated by the more efficient pipe., system, 
rather than the ditch system, thereby tending most of the lettuce 
production. 
(Lettuce will supposedly rot if sprayed by irrigation 
pipes.) 
As stated above, much of the marketing and packing of ItAm.-•grown 
vegetables was handled by the Walla Walla Gardeners Association. 
As they upgraded their facilities, capital investment mandated 
increases in efficiency through mechanization, again making 
smaller diverse crops less suitable. 
In the years before rubber bands came into wide use (not to speak. 
of Ware-.and--plastic "twisties"), many It. 
families gathered a 
marsh reed, which was used for tying bunches. I've heard it 
called words that sound like "junkie" and 
"zucchl. 
At certain 
times of the year the whale family would head for a nearby marsh 
19 
(such as the one where Blue Mountain Mall is now located, on W. 
Rose St., straddling the College Place--WW 
city linen, and spend a 
day picnicking and harvesting the plant. This was remembered 
fondly by older people who were children when they participated. 
The stems would be dried, and after drying, would be tied in 
bunches for storage. When they were needed, they would be soaked 
in water for two hours to make them pliable. Evidently they were 
quite durable. Peoples who remember this insist that the reed is; 
now extinct, at least locally, due to draining of wetlands for 
agriculture and development. 
The development of a specialized local variety of onion, the 
"Walla Walla sweat," is discussed in detail in Locati, pp. 20G-
223. In summary, local varieties of sweat onion, known "French 
onions," were grown as early as the 1900s. Locati's research 
suggests that sweet "French onions" were brought to the WW 
Valley, via LeHavre, by a Corsican, Pietro Pieri (also known as 
Pete Perri or Perry) around 1900. Local lore, and to some extent 
Locati.'s book, suggest that It. immigrant farmer John Arbini 
began selectively choosing earlier and more globelike examples of 
the "French" as seed onion during the 1920s, thereby breeding 
what were called "Early Arbinis," ancestors of the later "WW 
Sweets." (Further name confusion is added by the fact that the 
type of onion which includes Pieri's "French," "Early Arbini.s," 
and today's "WW Sweets" is classified by the USDA as "Sweet 
Spanish-type. ") 
20 
According to farmer/packers Greg and Louis Bossini., the name "WW 
Sweets" first appeared during the late 1940s. Marketing outside 
of the area by that name became important in the late 1950s or 
1960s. On the West Coast, they are now, more or less, a "gourmet'' 
onion, available for a limited period in from late June through 
mid-August. Sacks of hand-selected "WW SWeets" area shipped as 
gifts, and some "WW Sweets" are even ai•rfreighted to Japan and 
Alaska. When they are in season, they are very much in demand in 
the urban Northwest centers along Puget Sound and in and around 
Portland. 
A "WW Sweet Onion Commission" was established in 1981 to maintain 
standards, and to establish an official USDA-registered grade by 
that name.  Sweetness, globular shape, maturity, consistency in 
color, high moisture content (above 90%) and thin necks are 
determining quality factors. They must also be grown within Walla 
Walla County or in Umatilla County, OR., north of the Blue 
Mountain foothills just below Nilton-•F"•reewate•r. And most 
important, they must be from the locally-produced seed. 
WW 
Sweets" are open-pollinated onions, not hybrids. Bees are trucked 
in to pollinate the seed onions before spraying in the spring. 
"WW Sweet" seeds have been planted outside of the WW Valley, but 
they do not retain their distinctive sweetness. "WW Sweets" are 
not used as sweet onions by fast-food chains becaus'>e of the short 
season, and only their gourmet reputation has prevented their 
23. 
having been forced out of the market by the more consistently 
available "Vadalxa CGA.l sweets" and sweet onions from Texas. 
"Walla Walla sweet" production is largely hand labor. They cannot 
be harvested by machine, because they contain too much moisture 
and available machinery bruises them. Interviews with the Greg 
and Louis lcossi.ni, Jim Vinti, and Virgil Criscola go into detail 
about how they are planted, harvested, graded, and packed. 
Several major changes have occurred in the way they care planted 
and harvested. Originally, they were all seeded directly from 
selected homegrown seed. 
During the 1` 30ss, seed was planted ill 
seedbeds, so that the same land could be used for other crops, 
usually fall leaf crops such as spinach, and they seedlings were 
then transplanted in the spring. Around 1`37?, the cost of 
transplanting labor became so great and the profit from a second 
non-onion crop so low, that everyone almost immediately want bath; 
to direct seeding, which is still done today. 
The other transition is in packing. Originally, they were packed 
in onion-sacks right in the field, after they had dried out a 
little after harvest. During the 1940s they went to boxes, and in 
the 1960s, to large bins. Smaller operators, such as Criscola, 
still use boxes. 
Criscola uses local high school students as harvesters. They work 
together under his paternal guidance, which he sees as similar to 
22 
the old days, when family.-members were used to harvest anions. 
Most "WW Sweet" onion--growers raise their own seed. The smaller 
operators make the selection in the field during harvest, 
choosing the highest quality, of course. Larger operators who 
have their own packing plants, such as the Boss si.nis, choose them 
during grading. Other large operators, merely save a few bins 
from fields that have the best stands. Seed onions are 
transplanted by hand, winter over, are bee-.pollinated in spring, 
and harvested by hand in August. After being dried out, the seed 
pods are crushed, by hand or truck-tire, and washed. Viable seed 
sinks. Chaff and dead seed float. They are planted by a 
mechani.C:aal seeder in the fall. Owners of some of the newer types 
of seeders send their seed to California to have it pelletized. 
"WW Sweet" onion-growers are convinced and proud of the 
uniqueness of their crop, and of the tender loving carts that goes 
into seeding, harvesting, and packing. A sense of the aesthetic 
aspects of horticulture was supplied by Virgil Cri.scol.a. We 
recalls a neighbor who raised a poor crop of onions one year and 
then couldn't wait to get them harvested so that he wouldn't have 
to look at them anymore. 
A significant portion of the "WW Sweet" crop, especially that 
grown on the small pleats in the Blalock area, are retailed from 
garages or front--yard stands. During the "WW Sweet" season one 
23 
sees lots of homemade signs advertising "WALLA WALLA SWEET 
ONIONS." 
Criscola's granddaughters operate his stand for him. 
Most of the larger operators also grow "winter onions, 
sharp-
flavored cooking onions. They are from commercially-purchased 
hybrid seed, and varieties change with availability. "Winter 
onions," the second largest vegetable crop, are harvested and 
packed mechanically. They keep well and are shipped year--round. 
All onion--growing is severely affected by the fungus disease 
"white rot," which first appeared in the late 1940s. Much of the 
old Blalock land is infested by its spore's, which make onion-
growing impossible, unless fields are first covered entirely with 
plastic and fumigated with methyl bromide, a very expensive 
process. Some farmers, such as Crisr_ola, report good results, 
with four or five disease-free seasons after application. Others, 
such as the Daltosos, Magnaghis, and Guglielmellis have not had 
good results, and have given up growing onions in infested areas, 
growing wheat or landscaping turf there instead. Large operators 
rent land away from the infested areas. This: is one reason why 
more onions are being grown on the Oregon side, albeit by WW 
County, WA. growers. 
A countertrend to specialization has been occurring of late:. 
Retired small-plot holders, especially in the Blalock area, are 
growing more asparagus again, partly be?cause? of "white rot, 
and 
24 
partly because these perennials take far less labor, other than 
at harvest. Many of the small asparagus plats are owned by 
retired onion-growers. Some retirees also rent out former onion-
land to wheat-growers or plant it themselves. 
(Southeast 
Washington is one of the nation's major winter wheat--growing 
regions, and the hills to the north, west, and east of WW are in 
wheat most places.) Some of the larger growers, such as BClssini 
and Vinti, have diversified recently as a hedge against price 
changes. Asparagus, root crops, wheat, and even beef cattle are 
raised on their ground. 
The serious, large-scale onion-growers alrf•: mostly in the southern 
area, south of WW and College Place. The Blalock area's small 
plots are mostly farmed by retired and semi-retired. The southern 
holdings have consolidated in recent years. 
There are fewer and 
larger farms and more mechanization there. 
With a few exceptions, WW farmers never raised much of a grape 
crop, despite the fact that the Columbia Valley to the west of 
them is the leading U.S. wine-grape region outside of California. 
Bert and his father Giuseppe Pescial.l.o of northern Umatilla Co., 
OR., raised grapes (mostly Black Prince) and sold them to It. 
home--winemakers on the WA. side. Bert briefly had his own 
commercial winery, Blue Mountain Winery, in the early 1950s. In 
the heyday of home winemaking (before the 1` 60s) most Its. 
bought 
;Z:infandel grapes from CA. through the WWGA. Gary 1=iggins (a 
25 
Leonetti on his mother's side) first learned home•-winemaking from 
his mother's family, and established Le:'onetti'sii Cellars in the 
1770s. He grows some of his own grapes within WW city limits, and 
also purchases some from Columbia Valley viticulturists. Much of 
his commercial winemaking skill he has .learned from University of 
California--Davis oenology correspondence courses. 
Leone:'tti's> 
wines have won international prizes and they are some of WA.'s 
finest wines. In 1988, wi.nemaking finally became Figgins' full--
time profession. 
Former onion-grower-wife Carrie Locatx Criscola achieved an 
international reputation as an iris-bulb grower in the 1960s and 
'70s. She took it up as a hobby after widowhood and became active 
in the national iris-growers' association. She received orders 
for her bulbs from as far away as East Germany. She has scaled 
down in recent years, selling much of her stock to a commercial 
bulb-grower on the state line. 
Although the WW Valley, like much of eastern and central. WA. and 
Oregon, is prime orchard country, few Its. seem to have gone into 
orchardry. The prime exception in the WW Valley is the Pesci.allo 
family on County Rd. 
in northern Umatilla County, OR., near 
Milton•-F -reewate -r and Barrett. Genovese immigrant Giuseppe 
Pesc iallo established orchards there, after working for a 
Pendleton, OR. wheat-rancher who sponsored his immigration, and 
these orchards are still owned and operated by his sons, Bert and 
2G 
John and their respective wives, Rose and Violet. Giuseppe raised 
strawberries and watermelon commercially, and eventually 
developed they land into apple orchards. He raised Wineasap, Rome, 
Beauty, and Stamens. Now the Pes cialloa raise mostly Delicious 
(and a few Fuji, Aragalss, and Granny Smiths) and they also raise 
plums. Onion-grower Jim Vinti 
reports that this mother's family, 
It. immigrants, owned cherry orchards in Nez Fierce Co., Idaho, 
near Lewiston (about `)0 miles east of W. 
OTHER OCCUPATIONS 
Although the predominant occupation among the early WW Its. and 
ItAms. was horticulture or specialized small-scale agriculture, 
this was by no means the only occupation in the community. A 
number were railroad workers, in particular laborers or 
sectionhands. The town of Starbuck, WA., in Columbia's County, 
about thirty miles northeast of WW had, at various times, 
It. 
railroad-workers' families living in it, and some of these later 
moved to WW, including Nick Longo., Richard "Campy" Campanelli"s 
father lived in Dayton and Starbuck, WA. moved to Los Angeles, 
and then Campy and his widowed mother later moved to WW. 
Italian 
Heritage Association p'reside'nt Campy De stito is from a Spokane 
It. railroad--worker family. The ItAm. community in Spokane, which 
is probably larger than that in WW, was originally established by 
railroad workers, as Spokane is a major railroad hub in the 
27 
Northwest. 
Tony Ambrose and his mentor, the late Frank. Yuset, were barbers. 
Yuse later attended Gonzaga College Law School in Spokane and 
eventually became a judge in Spokane. Siam Curcio was a deputy. 
sheriff as early as 191.1.. 
The Greco family were tailors for 
several generations and later operated a dry-cleaning 
establishment. 
The first-generation Fazzaris were vegetable-growers, but the 
next generation operated a pool-hall and card-room, which later 
became: a tavern, which later became an It. restaurant (The 
Pastime Cafe on W. Main St".. 
in downtown WW.) . One of today's 
Fazza•ris owns a regionally famous It. restaurant in Clarkston, 
WA. 
(about 70 mi. e. of WW). 
The Gus Locati family had a Kaiser auto-dealership in they 
1.' 40s. 
A still-surviving son of It. pioneer Luigi Ri.zzu•t;i, Vincent, 
owned a music store and taught music. A Frank Gi.ovinaz zo taught 
music and was a founding member of the WW Symphony, supposedly 
the oldest in the Northwest. A number of second-generation ItAms. 
have worked in various capacities at the Washington State 
Penitentiary on WW's northern outskirts. This is WA. 9 s largest 
and oldest prison and it is still the main maximum security 
institution, complete with "death row." Today's generation of 
ItAmss. 
tend heavily toward the professions and include 
28 
physicians, teachers, professors, dentists, ca(_cf]lAlltdnts, 
and the 
like. 
ETHNIC CONSCIOUSNESS 
Ethnicity among WW Valley ItAms. is as 
function of consciousness 
of shared history and experience. No serious study of ethnic 
consciousness in the community has been attempted, at least not 
to my knowledge. Today's ethnic consciousness is centered around 
the Italian Heritage Association QHA), which was not founded 
until 1986, and its Italian Heritage Days festival., held every 
October, during Columbus Day week, since 1987. Most people I have 
spoken to feel that WW ItAms. are not particularly ethnic--
conscious, or at least that they weren't until. the 1980s. 
1-0900201 
Historical ethnicity is focused on 
in WW as 
elsewhere. Certainly the padrqni., such as Satu•rno/Breen, Luigi 
Rixxuti, Tony I_ocati, and Tachi, were once considered the most 
important members of the community. 
Frank Yuse (his name is pronounced as if it were "Huzzi" by Tony 
Ambrose, an old immigrant who still carries an It. accent. Who 
knows what his name really was in It.?) 
is respected for his 
initiation of the Columbus statue and Columbus Day parade. Tachi 
and deputy sheriff Sam Curcio are also remembered as leaders of 
29 
the 1911 Columbus celebration efforts. And Yuse is further 
respected for his career-change from WW barber to Spokane lawyer 
and ultimately judge. Yuse was probably the first WW It. to go to 
college (Gonzaga College, [Dater UniversityD, in Spokane, a 
Jesuit school founded in 1887 by 1=r. 
Joseph Cataldo, an It.-born 
missionary to the Northwest). Yuse founded the short-lived WW It. 
Workingmen's Club and later (not in WW) edited an It. newspaper. 
John Arbini's role in developing the "Early Arbini" onion, 
precursor of the "WW Sweet" from Pieri's Corsican "French onion'' 
also earned him a special and lasting status, as did his 'role as 
first president of the WWGA. Tony i._ocati is also still remembered 
as is 
skilled and innovative horticulturist. Some Also believe him 
to be the developer of the "WW sweet's" precursor. 
fol a certain 
extent the charter members of the WWGA are collectively 
Pr9m .i7P -Ah especially its early presidents, Arbi.ni, Joe 
Aliverti, and E. 
Guglielmelli. 
The first St.I=.A. 
pastor, Fr. Oscar Balducci, seems to have been 
somewhat controversial., perhaps because he was neither "Nilanese'' 
near "Calabrese," (or perhaps, in part, because of traditional 
anticlericalism 
 among It. men) . His advocacy of the purchase of 
stock in A. Giannini'ss Bank of Italy (Later the Bank of America) 
earned hull considerable enmity, despite his good intentions, 
because it supposedly declined precipitously in value after a 
number of WW Its. invested in it. On the other hand, he did found 
30 
the Its.' church, a significant institution for local Its. & 
ItAms. 
:toe Tachi'ss widow is a folk-historical figure for unfortunate 
reasons. She was illiterate and after her husband's untimely 
death in a wagon accident, she was supposedly exploited by a 
Greed: -friend, 
(usually called only "the Greer:") who squandered 
her fortune, so that when she diced, there was not even enough 
money left for her funeral. "The Greek" supposedly had some later 
brushes with the law and was run over by a train near the grounds 
of an Oregon sanitarium by Pendleton. 
Despite disputes and misunderstandings caused by some of Joe) J. 
Loi,atil s pronouncements in his book, he is one of the living 
():rc:)11 i 
npn i., 
not only because 
e of his literary achievement, but 
because, he was the first It. admitted to WW's prestigious 
private Whitman College, even though he declined for lack of 
funds, and because he was the first and only ItAm. State--Federal 
Fruit and Produce Inspector. Richard "Campy" Campanelli, a 
-retired teacher and librarian, although originally from 
California, is a local iarqminpiijq. His family had lived in the 
nearby railroad towns of Dayton and Starbuck, WA., and when he 
was a child, his widowed mother and he later moved to WW to re-
establish ties with SL. WA. 
family. 
His teaching of the It. 
language and service to the IHA are important factors in his 
prominence. 
31 
Such leading members of the IHA as Francis Christiano, who 
founded it, 
EMs. 7 Carmy Destxto, who has served as its president 
for several years, EMs. ] Jan Cristofori. Baton, who is It. 
Heritages Days chair, and EMr.l Millie Dutti.ce, County Fire 
Commissioner, who organized the IHA's sausage booth and many of 
its other activities, are important individuals among the: ethnic---
conscious. So are surviving immigrants, such as Nick Longo, 'T'ony 
Ambrose, Maria Greco, and Maria Dcaltoso. Christiano is also 
prominent in the community for other community service, such as 
his work as a seasonal National Park Service Ranger at the 
Wai.latpu/Whitman Mission Nat. Hi.st. Site, and as the organizer 
and for many years leader of the local squadron of the Civil Air 
Patrol. 
The more successful, larger onion farmers, such as Louis and Greg 
Bossini and Jim Vinti (present WWGA president) also rate as 
Rromi_i7gini. Another promin2ni2, who no longer lives in WW, 
is 
State Senator Alex Decci.o (R-Yakima) , who has served as the It. 
Heritage Days parade grand marshal. He is from a WW Valley onion-
growing family. 
Since so many of the present third- and fourth--generation ItAms. 
have become professionals, certain individuals have achieved 
special prominence for the accomplishments of their offspring, 
such as Charlie and Lillian Paietta, all of whose sons and 
32 
daughters have Ph.D.s (one daughter is a medical librarian at 
Yale, a son is a leading geneticist). Paie'tta' s late brother 
Steven was a nationally renowned accordionist, and served as the 
leader of Art Li.nkl.etter"s TV studio orchestra. 
Two young local ItAm s. 
have received some notice as artists. 
Both specialize in Western themes. Tom Moro, who is nearly blind, 
is a sculptor, with a studio in downtown WW. He has produced two 
commissioned 
tined sculptures that have attracted attention. One is a 
Western rifleman, and it stands in the lobby of the corporate 
headquarters of Winchester Arms back east. The other is called 
"Walla Walla Sweets," and depicts an It. 
boy sitting on a heap of 
sacks of onions holding a topping knife. 
It was commissioned by 
the WWCA, and eighty castings were made. The other artist is 
David Magnoni Manuel. He is bath a sculptor and a painter with a 
large Californian following. Nagnoni specializes in frontier 
depictions of Native Americans and the like. He lives at his 
studio in the Wallowa Mts. , near Lake Wallowa, OR. 
A somewhat reluctant prgyi_ntnto is Horace Lazzari, a native of 
Toronto, Canada, who has taught accordion in WW since the ].950s. 
He is one of the very few professional r_lassical accordionists in 
the USA. The local. ItAm. community loves to ask him to play It. 
music_ for It. Heritage Days and IHA activities, which he does 
reluctantly, and only occasionally. Lazzari believes that he is a 
misunderstood cl.assical musician, and much prefers his 
33 
appearances with the Portland and Seattle Symphonies. 
Prejudice 
Prejudice against Its. & ItAms. 
by non-Its. was once pervasive. 
All the old-timers I talked to agree to that, and Joe J. Locati 
discusses it in detail in his book, 
pp. 
96-•101., 
108--9, 
133, 
141--
.3. 
Local newspapers used such terms as "Dago" early in the 
century, neither and It. 
immigrants nor U.S.-born ItAms. were 
considered "American" or even white. In 1910, the WW new<.spaoer, 
IJL_1q_1 A2 
_1 .
Q E 
E, di.scusssi.nL1 truck; gardening, stated that because 
of the profits realized by "Chinamen" and Its., now "many wh.itq?
. 
men and those representing the best citizenship" were venturing 
into this trade. Charlie Paietta remembers, in his interview, a 
particularly vicious incident of prejudice towards him, by his 
public school first grades teacher. 
The prevalence of home winemaking, and the fact that some WW Its. 
did sell wine, led to considerable pressure on the community 
during Prohibition. Many considered local Its. & ItAms. 
categorically guilty of bootlegging. When an It. house was 
raided, any amount of wine found was sufficient to make the 
raiders destroy every vessel and container in the house. 
It is 
ironic that in 1989, an ethnic stereotype, "grape-stomping,'' 
became major activity in the annual. Italian Heritage Days; 
34 
festival.. 
The Mafia stereotype, on they other hand, is a topic of joking 
among WW ItAms. At the It. Heritage Days downtown festival. 
activities, joking about "godfather" was heard over the P. A. 
system. 
Although many WW ItAms. use it themselves, others consider they 
pronunciation, "Eye-talian," to be a slur. Relatively recently, 
one of Joe? J. 
Locati l 
s friends insensitively commented, 
"Eyea-- 
talians had so many kids, but they just put another cup of water 
in the, soup.'' 
It was probably prejudice that led some ItAm. families to 
Anglicize their names: 
aaturno=Breen, 5paunuoli=Spani.s:h, 
Magnoni=Manuel., DeElia=Della or E•lia, 
DealTosso== Daltoso, 
Pieri::=Perry, etc. 
Doug Breen Saturno, a young and successful 
irrigation company executive, recently legally changed his 
surname from Breen to 5aturno. This was not fully appreciated by 
all members of his family. 
Francis Christiana, a founder of the IHA, believes that residual 
fear of prejudice made many older ItAms. reluctant to get 
involved with the IH during its first years of activity. Mince 
then, however, some Its. have really "come out of the woodwork'' 
with collections of photos and experiences. The appearance: of Joe 
35 
J. Locati's Thee florticul.t:oral Flerri.tal•„ofi_WW Co. 
in 1978 caused 
cons iderable stir, bec ause of disagreement, on the part of some 
ItAms., with the conclusions of Loraati's research. This may, 
paradoxically, have created a greater sense of ethnic awareness, 
as people discussed and disputed some of Locati's published 
.statements. The present-day respectability in the U. S. 
of 
identification with one's ethnic origins has profoundly affected 
a large percentage? of WW ItAmss. This can be seen in the wholesale 
display of ethnic pride during every year's Italian Heritage 
Days. 
Within the ItAm. community prejudice existed between Northerners 
and Southerners. Joe J. Locati, of Northern origin, attributes 
this in part to di'f'ferences in temperament. It seems to have 
disappeared, and several fam ili es claim their grandparents or 
parents to have been the first to marry across they north-south 
line. Food customs were, of course, vastly different, with the 
Northerners' ba bied on rice and co rnmeal, the Southerners' 
oil 
pasta and tomato sauce. Music was also an import ant part of SIt. 
social life, less so for Nit s. 
Locaati al so notes that early It s. 
expressed prejudice toward "He•ri.r_agni," who were supposed to be 
soft and lazy, unlike the virile sons of Italy. 
Food 
The most pervasive and complex manifestations of ethnicity among 
WW ItAms>. are the community's foodways. Apart from the ethnic 
36 
revival, its foodwcaya are also its most accessible ethnic 
expressions. 
WW ItAm. foodways area influenced by both regional 
food customs a:,c-
'.0, 
those of Lombardy and of Southern Italy, 
respectively, and by modern Italian-American cooking. The latter 
is, of course, descended from, but by no means identical to, the 
cooking of Southern Italy. 
i=oodways among the first generation were influenced in part by 
the availability of home-grown foods. The home vegetable garden 
(the term "kitchen garden" is unknown) is s>ti.l.l a prominent 
feature of older ItAm. homesteads. Then., as now, great care went 
into growing of tomatoes;, especially by hilts. People who use 
"saffron" (safflower) in their hilt. 
cooking, still grow and dry 
their own. Charlie Paietta and Francis Ch•ristiano (the latter 1/2 
NIt. & 1/2 GIt.) grow large crops of safflower in their backyard 
gardens, which they share with other ItAms. in the area. Early in 
the century, much, if not most, food was raised at home. People 
had larger home gardens, which were mostly tended by the women and 
children. Most people also kept livestock, usually a cow, at 
least one pig, and some chickens. Members of the WWGA bought bulk 
rice, spaghetti, salt, sugar, and coffee at its co-operative 
store, charged against deliveries of produce. 
Canning and salting were universal among people who raised their 
own food. 
Rio was meat-preservation and sausage-making. Vegetables 
were pickled and salted in crocks. This was also done by non-
37 
Its., but the Its. had an It. name for it, ssal sljuip (?) . Peppers, 
(esp. 
thick - skinn ed "roasting pe ppers" or 
ai.]er ro stu'Cji L?J 
which were ro a sted first), tomatoes, and green tomatoes were 
favorites. Some women made a sun-dried tomato paste, hung and 
dried in bags on the clothesline. 
People who raised their sawn hogs butchered them at home, too. 
Groups of family.-members would assemble at the home of whomever 
had a hog ready to slaughter. The men then killed and dressed the 
hog and caught the blood. The carcass, blood, and organs were 
then turned over to the wo me n. 
Th us was butchering done as 
teamwork. Helpers received some sausage, bacon, and/or fatback as 
payment, while the family who raised the hog kept most of the 
meat. People who remember these 
 home butche•rings remember them, 
do so fondly because of the festive atmosphere that often 
prevailed. 
!"lams were sa lted and smoked. Butts and shoulders were made into 
sausage, and the sausage was stuffed into the casings, which were 
of course, immediately available. Some of the details'of WW It. 
home--butchering occur in Thp__Wg11t3_Wq 1q_1j gal iAn He•rQA12

Its rubric is "Butchering in the 
Calabrese sstyl.e.'. 
The blo o d was immediate ly made into gyng1E?rg, 
a 
"blood pudding," locally called "jam." The description of this in 
38 
the WW IHA Cookbook offended a number of IHA members, who found 
it gross. Both Milanese and Southerners made a dry sausage or 
salami. The salami was made with red wind added. Milanese favored 
allspice and white pepper, Southerners favored fennel seed and 
crushed dried hot red peppers and/or black pepper. Similar soi.ces 
were used in the fresh sausage, but in smaller quantities. Salami 
was, of course, dried. Sausage-making, especially salami, was 
usually men's work. Fresh sausage had to be eaten soon, but was 
also preserved by packing it in a crock surrounded by melted 
lard, which later hardened and supposedly kept it fresh even in 
hot weather. When Its. built their first houses (Actually they 
had them built. Very few homes or even outbuildings were built by 
Its. 
in the WW Valley), the first priority was a shed or cellar 
with a dirt floor, for winemaking and sausage-- and ham--curing. 
Li!•;r-_ 
their non-It. neighbors, many of the women made lye soap 
with the lard. Cracklings were often baked into bread. 
The women were 'responsible for 'rendering lard from the fatback. A 
type of headcheese was also made. So was qjp.iqo.j (?), split pork 
loin packed with salt and pepper in casings and hung to dry. 
Some older still-living TtAms., such as Bert Pesci.allo and Tony 
Ambrose, do not remember their childhood cuisine as being 
particularly ethnic. They 'remember eating the same homegrown 
meat, 
fowl., 
and potatoes as their non-It. neighbors. 
39 
One food-related practice that early WW Its. seem to have shared 
with their non-It. neighbors was hunting for game. Game hunting 
was probably not particularly common among the impoverished 
classes in the old country, but it may have become an imoo•rtant 
ritual among WW Its. One of Ch•ri.stiano" s early photographs, for 
instance, shows a group of It. men returned from a hunting trip 
with a display of rabbits. Marilyn McCann remembers her 
grandfather, Tony L_ocati., 
and his friends going hunting in the 
sagebrush country near Burbank and Pasco, WA. 
Its. whose menfolk: 
were members of the Knights of Columbus looked forward to the big 
annual mulligan stews which the K. of C. 
prepared, and which 
contained a lot of rabbit. McCann remembers rabbit and pheasant 
being cooked up in a rich tomato aal.l(_e. 
(I_ocati was a Milanese, 
but his wife was 57t. ) 
Charlie Paietta remembers his mother trapping quail for food 
during a poverty-stricken winter. He believes these wild fowl. 
helped them make it through that difficult season. 
In the early days, the sharp distinction between Milanese and 
Slt. was reflected in the groups 
7
 
respective diets. The Milanese 
diet was based on rice and cornmeal as staples, the Southern, 
based on pasta. Southerners used tomato sauce and more pungent 
spices. 
The main spice used by Milanese was "saffron," which was 
tactually not saffron, but safflower, and which people:: grew (and 
some, such as Francis Chris•t:iano and Charlie Paietta, still grow 
40 
today) . Milanese preferred white pepper. Southerners used much 
more ga•rl.i.c? than Milanese, and preferred black or red pepper or 
crushed, dried hot red peppers. Southerners also used lots of 
fennel seed, sweet basil, and oregano. Both Milanese and 
Southerner's used olive oil. Southerners preferred sharp cheeses 
such as •romano and parmesan, although these were very hard to get 
in the old days. Both Milanese and Southerners made homemade 
cottage cheese of various grades. 
The It. 
liking for fish and seafood was hard to indulge in WW, 
which is almost 300 miles from the nearest salt water. DigAl Ei 
(dried cod), a staple in the old country, was a delicacy in the 
new. People who went to Seattle or Portland sometimes brought it 
back. for relatives and friends. It was sometimes special-ordered 
at Christmas, and was then part of the Christmas Eve dinner. A 
few old-timers still remember bqg221 
fondly, but the younger 
ItAms. do not have a taste for it today. The '.3.It. 
custom of 
eating eel at Christmas was indulged by a few, despite extremely 
high cost. Virgil. C•riscola remembers his father ordering a supply 
before? Christmas, when available?, from Jan Francisco. To this 
day, he thinks it was extravagant, because his father could not 
really afford it. 
In general., WW Its. ate much more fresh vegetables than their 
Anglo neighbors, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and 
tomatoes. Fried cabbage was a staple. So were green beans. hilt. 
41 
Maria Dal.toso still makes a traditional dish called c:atssola (?), 
a cabbage stew cooked with ports skins, bones and meat, which her 
family likes very much. 
Fruit was cheap and easily available when in season, as E. 
WA. 
and OR. are prime orchard country. No-one to whom T spoke 
remembers anyone trying to grow figs, which was a't 
common practice 
in CA. and on the. 
East Coast. Some figs were occasionally 
available if ordered from Cpl. 
through the WWGA. Louis Rizzuti (no 
relation to the old WW Rizzuti family), a native of Steubenville, 
OH., who settled in WW in the late 740s, after marrying a loc:a:l. 
ItAm. woman, raised them with great success in some years and 
utter 'failure in others. 
:1.989 was an especially bad year because 
of the February freeze, which almost killed the well-wrapped 
trees. Dy the time the figs were big enough to start ripening, 
frost set in and destroyed the entire crop. Rizzuti has about 
twelve trees, in three varieties, in his back yard in a 
residential neighborhood of WW. When they are in good supply, he 
olives away lots of them to ItAm. friends. Some of the old It. 
immigrants had mulberry trees can their property. Mulberries were 
grown in Lombardy for their leaves, fed to silkworms. There may 
have been some desire on the part of NIt. immigrants to establish 
a silk industry in the U.S., but nothing ever came of it. The 
mulberries were mostly eaten by children when in season, and 
several informants remember how they loved to go to certain 
relatives' farms when the fruit were available. 
42 
A good sampling of WW It.. 
and xtAm. cuisine can be had from 
perusal of Th•r_WW_7FMIE1_Cr}C•F t•ac•Ec, 
despite the fact that it also 
contains many non - It. recip es. 
Most of the research for the boob: 
was done by Marilyn McGann (a 1/4 It. descended from the I_ocatis) 
and she has become quite expert in the local historic-ethnic 
cuisine. The book contains a byline for all but a few 
contr ibutors, and it a lso contains differing 'recipes for the same 
product in many rases. When one knows if a family is Milanese, or 
SIt., 
it is possible to trace regional, as well as family, 'recipe 
variations. Many of the recipes contributed by old-timers were 
not expressed in exact measu rement ("Half an eggshell of ..., •• 
is 
one example McC ann Dave.) 
In some of those  cases a yo unger 
relative, or McGann herself, watched the product being made and 
measured the amount:., using standard American cooking 
measurements, after it was prepared by the contributor/cook. 
Those measurements were then entered in the cookbook. Aestito 
believes that most of the old recipes died with the older 
population. "There are many recipes in that cemetery.'' 
Some of the recipes in the WW l:HA Cookbook. are listed by tie] igygd

The majority of recipes submitted do not show a place of origin, 
44 
but all show name of person who submitted it. WW •_1:HA_CcyqF;tgtg 
is 
101 pp. 
long and contains 427 recipes.  Aside from ordinary 
recipes, it also gives instructions for such processes as 
crocking vegetables (pp. 
•7-9), 
"butchering pigs in the Calabrese 
style" (Ef5-6), 
preparing and using "Walla Walla sweet" onions 
(136), and roasting gj2jjgp 
(chestnuts) 
(175-6). Details of 
consciously It. 
portions of the local diet can be derived from a 
careful reading of the WW_•IIHA__CgpF:l p[p. 
More than one •recipe is given for common and regionally varying 
foods. The ethnographic accuracy of the cookbook may be 
disputable, but it does contain mostly family recipes, many of 
which were transmitted over more than two generations. It also 
contains a few recipes which area obviously not It. at all. 
NIt. cooking in WW was centered around such staples as rice and 
jao1e?nly, sometimes made in a especial copper riEA•t:'l:o_ pan. Rice is 
typically served as Q. jQjg. The WW_ HA Cookbook contains several 
recipes for each. NIt., especially t_onate Pozzolo, is given as a 
place of origin for a substantial portion of the foods listed by 
origin. Some of thecae foods do not seem NIt. at al.. 
riam jpq 
navy beans with hamhocks, was another traditional everyday 
entree. When zucchini were in surplus, they fried zucchini. 
blossoms. Somewhat similar to pgjgll•j was SIt. qq j, made with 
wheat instead of cornmeal. 
45 
Several people of NIt. background noted that in marriages between 
NIt. mein and ,Salt. 
women, the menfolk often came to prefer the, 
SIt. cooking of their wives. ItAmss. 
in WW still use a .lot of It. 
foods in their diets. The proverbial ItAm. sipaghetti with meat 
sauce or meatballs, .lasagne, minestrone, ravioli, and pizza is 
very popular, but then it is also very popular among non-Its. 
However Q. ncjjq and pgjgpjq are very popular with WW NIt. 
families, and several families of NIt. origin said they still use 
lots of rice,. Another popular food than and now was fried salami.. 
Restauranteu -r Frank Fazza -ri remembers pizza arriving relatively 
late in WW, 
in the late 1950s. His own business, The Pastime 
Cafe, on W. 
Main St. 
in downtown WW, 
dial not start serving 
s>paghetti until. the 1940s, or lasagne (their featured special) 
until the 1970s. 
This despite the Pastime being the prime, 
downtown gathering place for Its. since its establishment: in 
1927. The Pastime's present-day cuisine is hearty Slt. /ItAm. 
platters of spaghetti., ravioli, lasagne, and they also do a brisk 
trade in pizza. Fried salami is a popular entree. Many of the 
people I interviewed regularly eat there., (=azzari's son and 
daughter are taking over the business 
s as Frank gradually retires. 
Another son operates an It. restaurant in Clarkston, WA., on the 
Idaho border, which has a widespread reputation for its quality. 
Sausage--making is an art which had practically died out, but was 
revived in recent years. Informants tell. that Sits. preferred a 
46 
peppery sausage, with crushed recd peppers and lots of fennel 
seed. NIts. preferred ca 
milder sausage, eschewing the fennel seed 
and using milder white pepper. The IHA operates as 
sausage booth 
at It. Heritage Days, and also at rather local festivals, such as 
July "WW Sweet Onion I)aays>" and May "WW Hot Air Balloon Roundup.'' 
They have been invited to bring it to Watsonville, CA. 
for the 
Garlic Festival, but have not: done so yet. Millie Buttice is in 
charge of the booth, and he collects as 
group of ItAm. men a few 
days before a sale and they make the sausage out: of pork butt, 
which is ordered in bulk through the meat department of a local. 
supermarket. The sausage making becomes as 
festivity in itself. 
Two varieties are made, hot and mild. The hot does not seem 
particularly hot. Aside from its spicing, the sausage is more 
like as 
Garman Bratwurst than an It. pepperoni. 
Virgil Criscola tells of his son coming homer from college 
complaining that his family was not acting It. enough, because 
they no longer made sausage or wine. 
Since then, Mr. 
Crissc:ol.a 
has been making sausage regularly, which he preserves in the 
freezer. He buys imported Danish casings from a supplier in 
Seattle. 
Food is an especially important ethnic: expression at holidays, 
particularly at Christmas. Discussions about Christmas 
celebrations were mostly discussions about food. Christmas Eye 
or Vigil is, of course, 
as 
fast day until. midnight. Some WW It. 
47 
families waited until after returning from midnight mass before 
having Christmas Eve dinner. Many ate.' traditional. "American'' 
turkey or ham in that event.. Several cold..-timers said that 
Christmas was the only time they had fruit or nuts in the house. 
Special foods, such as eel or b< gil
.2 (dried rod) were ordered by 
some families. 
Nowadays ethnic expression through Christmas food is mostly 
centered around sweets, namely shcortbreads and pastries. Women of 
they IHA gather at the homey of Carmy Des•t:i.to to make large batches 
of Christmas cookies for the IHA-meeting that precedes Christmas. 
(They also gather to make It. 
pastries before It. 
Heritages Days; 
in October, which are then sold at an IHA booth.) 
The day that I spent at Ms. Dessti.to'ss, 
December 2, 
four women, 
Destito, Ellen i_epiane Anthony, Elveda (_epiane Ll.ia, and Mary 
ilia Gunberg, making crqqtel.li and ajj .iArdJ. (?). C;rMQqj i, 
seem 
to be the most popular Christmas cookie. They are a deep-fried 
cruller-like cookie identical to Danish k1
. gjngr, but leavened 
with whiskey or brandy„ gAl. Ifli are a baked shortbread. Mrs. 
Gunberrg had also made a batch of tordille, another fried cookie. 
Most of these 'greats were served as refreshments at the next 
day's IHA meeting. Certain individuals specialize in making 
specific pastries. 
Desitito and her friends shill keep certain rituals associated 
48 
with baking, such as offering a prayer to St. Martin, when 
putting the fresh pastries into the oven or the deep-frier: "In 
the name of Clod and Wit. 
Martin, where it was empty, let it be 
full," recited in It. 
Certain foods that are not necessarily Christmas - related are made 
by WW ItAms. to give away at the holiday season. PIppIppi bread 
is on e of these. Louis Rizzuti makes enormous batches o f piA
Z2lli. 
(It. waffles) more or less as a hobby and sells them to ItAm. 
families at IHA meetings and simil ar social situa ti ons. 
He has a 
portion of his basement set aside as a 
Ji.ZZgjjq shop. He recently 
ordered a new electric pi lgIlp iron from a mail-order catalogue. 
Eli.tIlti . were served on Palm Sunday morning. Maria Daltoso has 
always made a speC:ial ravioli for Easter. Easter cookies were 
iorGac _m< _rg•a:ritac•• 
(?), made with egg yolk. Many still eat ri2g1to 
at :.aster. 
(mother Easter dish, associated with the 
Saatu rno/preen family, 
is pRipgQDp (?), 
as quiche?-like entrees with 
cheese, macaroni, and halo, 
baked in a crust, with decorative 
crust--strips on top. 
Wine 
One of the great mysteries about the WW It. community is, 
"What 
happened to all the home winemaki.ng?" Everyone talks about the 
49 
old-timers making their own wind. A non-It. Olympia acquaintance 
of mine in her early fifties, who grew up in WW, remembers 
"learning to drink wine" from 
her ItAm. neighbors, all of whom 
made their own. She remembers this from as late as the late 
1950s. I meat not a single ItAm. who made their own wine, with the 
excerption of half-It. commercial winemaker Gary Figgi.ns, 
proprietor of Leonetti's Cellars. 
This is especially odd, since eastern and central WA. is one of 
the U.S.' major viticulture regions. All along the Snake and 
Columbia Rivers are huge vineyards and wineries. Frank Clrsielll, 
WW's first It. settler, raised grapes. 'Talking to old-timers, one 
gets the impression that few It. settlers raised grapes. Most of 
them bought grapes for home winemaking, ordering them, esp. 
Zinfandels, by the carload from CA. through the WWGA. Bert 
Pesc 
ia.11o and his father Giuseppe, on the Oregon side, did, 
however raise considerable quantities of $Lack Prince, a 
Zinfandel.-like wine grape, and sold many to Its. on the WA. side. 
The only other It. viticulturist I heard about was a Frank Sabuc:o 
who raised grapes on the shores of the Columbia River in the 
little community of Attalia, in WW Co., about 25 miles west of 
WW. Sabuco's vineyards were flooded by the McNary Dam in the 
19`0s. 
James W. 
Phillips' 
ESe•attle« 
Univ. of WA. Press, 1976 edi.ti.onl, 
p. 
8, 
says, of Attal.ia, "named 
for a hamlet in Italy in 1906 by the wife of developer V.K. Loose 
of Seattle.") 
50 
Most It. 
families had a wine-cellar, often in a separate shed, or 
in a dirt-floored basement in the house. Pasquale Saturno/C~rank. 
Breen's was the most elaborate, a I 1/2-story brink structure. 
The original press and fermenting barrel, some of the aging 
barrels, bottles, and demijohns that PS/hB used are still extant, 
but have not been used for scores of years. Pesciallo donated his 
to the hart Walla Walla lYll.l<.seum. 
Pesciallo did venture into commercial winemaking for a few years 
during the 1950s, making a "Blue Mountain Wineries" label. Black 
Prince Cabernet, but a cold freeze wiped out his vines, putting 
him out of business. His father and he made lots of home wine. He 
still has several gallons of vintage 173'7 on hand, but does not 
drink it because of diabetes. The commercial production and 
quality control aspects of oenology, he learned from a Dr. H.Y. 
Yang of Oregon State College School of Agriculture. Pesciallo 
describes, in detail, the steps to successful homer winemaking, 
emphasizing quality of drapes and extreme cleanliness of 
fermenting and aging barrels. Whiskey-barrels made the best arcing 
barrels. Pesciallo always used the grapes' own natural yeast, 
never commercial yeast. 
Pesciallo complained how much of the 
wine made by WW Co. 
Its. was of poor quality, a "Dago red," he 
called it. He attributed this to the use of fermenting and ageing 
barrels that: were insufficiently clean. 
51 
1=iggins learned home wi.nemaking from his mother's (Leonetti) 
family. He started it as a hobby in the 1970s, then started 
studying it in earnest. He learned some of his ter_hni.que, from 
Pesci.allo, and some from correspondence courses from Univ. of 
CA.--Davis. He is now a fulltime commercial viticulturist and 
winE.maker, raising some of his own grapes, right within the WW 
city limits, and buying others: from Snake and Columbia Valley 
growers. His Cabernets have won several national prizes and fetch 
high retail pricers.. 
Bert Pesciallo also taught some of the rudiments of wineamaking to 
another WW commercial winemaker, non-It. Rick Small., owner of 
Woodward Canyon Winery in Lowden, WW Co., about 10 mi.. 
west of 
WW. Small. bought Pescial.lo's old imported French all--glass 
ebull iometer. 
It. homer winemakers were evidently quite skilled at one time. 
Old-timers remember the epithet "Dago red" being used for the 
poorer quality product, especially that made from a second run of 
drape-squeezings fortified with store-bought sugar. This product 
was also called Vip2jjq or "second," and was, for those who made 
it, the everyday beverage, or was drunk as new wine while the 
"first" was aging. The good homemade product (or "first") was 
supposedly of high quality. A few It. 
families even distilled 
(illegally, of course) their own grrjp2i. 
(brandy) . Those who did 
not own a press evidently literally "stomped" .their grapes, 
52 
wearing rubber boosts. 
This is ironic_, considering that "grape-
stomping" is an many places a negative It. stereotype, and that 
the IHA instituted a "grape stomp" contest as mart of It. 
Heritage Days in 1989. They learned how to put on a "drapes stomp'' 
it from 
non-It. 
wineries' festivals in the Tri•-Cities 
(Kennewick-Pasco-Richland) area. 
It is worth summarizing three different understandings of the 
frankly derogatory term, "nago red." 7o WW Its. and ItAmss. , it 
meant poor quality red wane, either the "second" made from grape 
si••'.insi and sugar, orjust a poor product, 
:">uC.h 
as the one 
Pesciallo noted was the product of insufficiently clean barrels. 
To non-Its., it merely meant homemade wines made by Its. or ItAms. 
During Prohibition, It. 
families were closely watched by 
authorities and many were arrested for simple home winemakinq. 
The ItAm. community also suffered a bootlegger stigma, which it 
is still living down, and which may have something to do with the 
virtual disappearance of home winemaking. Old-timers told me that 
in Italy their folks dial not makes wind, but bought it from a 
vintner or winemaker, and that they didn't start making their own 
until they arrived here. Some It. 
families actually were 
bootleggers and sold to non--It. neighbors and all shared the 
stigma. Despite this, Prohibition-era stories are a common 
reminiscence among older ItAms. , usually centered around the 
wrong family being raided, a virtually innocent homey winemaker 
33 
being punished with inappropriate severity, or rude, drum; non---
Its. 
(such as one prominent Oregon judge) arriving at Its.' doors 
in the middle of the night looking for wine to buy. 
Most ItAms. agree that drunkenness was extremely uncommon among 
the oldtimerss, 
but that all dram; wine regularly at mealtimes. 
Some mixed wine with water, others were vehemently opposed to 
that practice. G. 
Pescaillo said "When you want to drink wine, 
drink wine, when you want to drink water, drink water." A wine-
drink still consumed by some is rfiuqerl Q, a sweet wine-and-raw-
egg-yolk mixture. See WW__ .H__Cqqi;hqgk, 
p. 
15. 
A few Its. also made home--brew beer, especially during 
Prohibition. After Repeal, when the old-timers came to town on 
Saturday, they drank bear at The Pastime Cafe. Beer was more of a 
special-occasion drink, wine an everyday drink. 
I cannot say, categorically, that no present-day WW ItAms. make 
homemade wine. Several people said that they thought that 
probably a few old-timers still made a little, but no-one knew of 
any. Virgil Cri-scola's son, coming home from college?, complained 
not only about the lack of sausage--making, but also the lark of 
winemaking in his family. His sausage complaint had an impact, 
but they Criscolas still don't make wine. WW ItAms. joke a lot 
about winemaking, "grape-stomping," the old-timers' fondness for 
wine, etc., but they seem somewhat nervous about it. Perhamss it 
54 
is the Prohibition-based stigma or the years of anti.-It. 
prejudice that stereotyped Its. as Winemakers and wine-drinkers 
that have done this. The State of WA. also has a very pervasive 
anti-alcoholism and anti-drunk-driving campaign, and regular use 
of alcoholic beverages is starting to carry ca strong negative 
stigma. 
Music 
WW ItAms. are agreed that music: was primarily an activity pursued 
by SIts. 
Many of the early alt. settlers were musical. The 
mandolin and the accordion welre the preferred instruments. 
Looking through old photo collections, one sees a number of 
photos of people holding or playing musical. instruments. Certain 
families were, of course, more musical than others. Immigrant 
Frank Ri.zzuti (co-proprietor of the Pastime Cafe) played violin 
and several. Other instruments, and was WW's first accordion 
teacher. His son, Vincent; J. 
"Jim" Rizzuti., was for years 
proprietor of and music teacher at Uptown Music on Boyer Ave. in 
WW. A number of WW's accordionists learned from Vincent. 
In the old days, traveling music teachers offered .lessons. One of 
these, who settled in WW, was Frank Giovinazzo, master of many 
instruments, especially French horn. Giovi.nazzo played with the 
WW Symphony, founded in 1706, WA.'s oldest symphony orchestra. 
Gi.ovinazzo instructed many It. youths in music_, 
because he would 
take payment in produce. He also played in a short-lived WW It. 
53 
marching band during the 1920s. Virgil Criscola, an accomplished 
trumpeter, took lessons on several instruments from Giovi.nazzo. 
His father was totally opposed to paying cash for lessons, but 
had nothing against paying Giovinazzo in onions. Francis 
C:hristiano says that old WW City Directories had a number of It.-
owned music schools. 
Many older ItAms. remember social gatherings of extended families 
and neighbors on Sunday afternoons. 
These were often music-
accompanied, again with mandolin and accordion the favorite 
instruments. 'There was often dancing at these gatherings.. 
Musicians also played at weddings 
gs and at shivcaree s. 
When Francis 
Christiano was married, in the 1940s, there was a large shivaree,

Although F=rancis does not consider himself a musician, his son 
has played guitar in se•?veraal successful local rock bands. 
WW's leading musician of all time was the late Steven Paaietta, 
all 
acknowledged musical genius, and younger brother of Charlie. 
After learning piano from the nuns at St. Vincent" s School, he 
had (at age 11) his owls live radio show, which he broadcast 
during the school's lunch hour, riding his bicycle from the 
school to the radio station and back. He soon took up the 
accordion and mastered the instrument, learning it from as 
It. 
teacher in Yakima. During his teens, he played regularly for the 
Elks and other clubs. He later left WW for Portland and 
ultimately CA. For sixteen years, he led the orchestra and also 
played accordion on the old Art I_inkletter's House Party TV-show. 
At one time he had five orchestras, and was signed to compose and 
arrange music for the Disney Corp. He died suddenly and 
unexpectedly while only in his fifties. He was once:' called "the 
world's greatest accordionist.'' 
Another of WW's leading ltAm. musicians was accordionist Stanley 
Deccio, an onion-grower. According to his son, David (also ail 
accomplished accordionist), Staley supplemented his farm income 
by playing music at clubs, weddings, social gatherings and the 
like. He believes that Stanley would not have made it through the., 
had produce-price times of the 1950s without his musical income. 
57 
Stanley, who died during the 19'10`x, played with a number of 
e?nEielllE)a.es, 
often including drums, guitar, and/or saxophone. 
Stanley Deccia' s first instrument was mandolin, but there" was 
more work for a.ccordion in the community. 
Local music was typical SIt. dace music, tarantellas, waltzes, 
and marches. A few still pursue this repertoire. The best one I 
head was Staley Deccio, a young accountant, descended from al 
grower family. He plays accordion at It. Heritage Days and at 
other IHA activities, despite not being a member„ He is very 
skilled and clean. His young son, Ryan, has also taken up the 
instrument. David Dercio did not learn to play from his musician 
father, but 'took lessons from Vincent "Jim" Rizzuti at Uptown 
Music. When he played his best It. repertoire for me, 
it 
consisted of the following tunes: 
(The names are those given by 
Mr. Decc:i.o.) 
"Waltz Spagnuola, " "Walla Walla Tarantella" 
(Fie does 
not know an It. name for this one, and says it was a faavo'rite 
among the old-timers in the area) , "Serio (?) 
Waltz,'' 
"Tirami.ntai " (":?) , "0 Solo Nio, 
"Rain, Rain Polka," "Napolitana 
Tarantella, "
"Tick Tock Polka, 
"Giornaa Belli" (?), 
"Casa d'Oro" 
(?),  "0 Maria" (waltz), "Santa Lucia," "Carnival of Venice," 
" and 
"Return to Me.'' 
Another ItAm. musician in David Venneri, who plays accordion and 
sings typi.caal. 
It. 
popular songs, such as "Came Back to Sorrento,'' 
"U Solo Mio, " and "Return to Me." 
He does not perform 
58 
professionally, but only at ItAm. events. Mel Buttice plays 
mandolin, which he also learned at Uptown Music. He owns an early 
1920s Gibson A•-modal and often plays at ItAm. gatherings. He 
plays strictly from sheet music. His repertoire is similar to 
Venneril s. 
WW's leading ItAm. musician is Horace Lazz.ari. Mr. Lazaarri is as 
native of Toronto, Canada and came to WW during the 1950s to 
establish a music-teaching business. Lazzatri is one of the few 
classical accordionists anywhere. He arranges music of the 
masters for accordion and occasionally plays concerts with the 
Seattle and Portland Symphonies. With the decline of popularity 
of the accordion, his business has largely faded. He is not fond 
of folk and popular music_ and feels that playing it often in 
public debase his skills as a classical musician. He doe 
occasionally play for IHA events, but prefers not; to. 
Onion-grower Virgil. Criscola is an accomplished trumpeter. He 
took lessons on a number of instruments from Gi.ovinazzo, finally 
settling on the trumpet. Although he played occasionally with 
Stanley Dec_cio, his repertoire is not It. at all  and he prefers 
swing. During his high school years (1930s), he played in a swing 
dance band, despite being punished by the public_ school's music 
teacher for playing "unacceptable" music. 
Many WW ItAms. collect It. 
phonograph records, especially those 
9 
who visit Italy. I heard such popular tunes as "Eh Cumpa•ri., " 
"F"unicul. i, F 
unicula, " "0 Solo Nio, " and "Come Back to Sorrento'' 
on people's hi-fis. 
WW Its. have not maintained a strong tradition of It. song. A few 
do sing, such as Venne•ri. Francis C:h•ri<.stiana's father was 
evidently an accomplished singer of folk songs, as well as a 
guitarist. Jim 07Boyle, a local non-It. professional Irish-style 
tenor is often hired to sing It. 
favorites at IHA events. There 
is some interest in establishing an It. ethnic choir, especially 
since people have been exposed to Vancouver, D. C. 9 s Italian Folk 
Chorus, who come to WW to perform during It. Heritage Days. This 
has yet to happen. 
The most: tradi.ti.onal singer is Maria Dalto so, age 80, who came to 
WW from Veneto in 1928 as a bride. She has always been known as a 
singer, and her onion-growing family used to sing together while 
thinning, weeding, topping, and harvesting. Her kids loved to 
have her sing, and would gladly wort; beside her in the fields if 
only she would sing. Some of her friends and neighbors still 
cajole her to sing old It. 
songs, especially one long ghastly 
ballad of murder and inr_estual jealousy. 
PigngE; Dal.toso is a warm, wonderful. person. She knows a number 
of poetic recitations, which she believes that `'she learned in 
school in Italy, although she is not sure. She thinks she also 
60 
learned most of her songs there. When she is called upon to 
perform (only in a living room context, never in public), she 
writes her material down from memory and then uses the written 
page to help her remember. She did this on the occasion of my 
visit. 
For me she recited a number of poems. She also sang the following 
in It. and summarized them in English: 
The murder ballad, 
"Uti7••_bE•1•1Gz ._ca_1r r7xi,c•>n f•i7ra.uJ,••" 
("A pretty 
and gracious girl"): A father is jealous of his lovely daughter, 
forbids her to court. While mother is at market and father is 
working in the field, she has a visit from a suitor and allows 
the bread in the oven to burn. The father comes home, 
rinds  out 
and runs her through with a fork (pitchfork or manure fork?) . The, 
mother then comes home sees, and goes insane. The father is then 
taken away "with a devil in him ." 
A Christma s sang, 
"•i i.(?SXll µ •y•illtli llg µ
!? w ll••wt?" 
(?) . 
A song about a flower girl, "E ivarig" Q) , talking about the 
beauty that she brings u s and describing a rose and bud she has 
for sale as a mother and baby. 
Mrs. Daltaso said that she probably knew several. other It. 
songs, 
but could not suddenly remember them at the time of my visit. 
Likewise a number o f "bedtime stories.'' 
Dancing was a common social custom throughout this century. in 
61 
the old days, folkdanr_es such as the tarantella were common. 
Later they were supplanted by ballroom dances, such as the 
foxtrot. The waltz transcended older and newer times. Sunday 
afternoon gatherings at the various growers' homes often included 
dancing. 
In recent years, It. 
folkdances have been revived by the It• A. 
There are two :tl-A-ssponsored dance groups, Adults' and Chi.ldren 7 s 
It. Heritage Dancers. They perform in stylized rest, 
white, and 
green costumes. Geraldine Manuel. Hartley has leaned many It.. 
dances from folkdance books and taught them to the Adult group, 
who perform at It. Heritage Days and other local festive events. 
Two members of that trouper, Cheryl Landoni. Knotts and Mary 
Chri.stiano Kleyn,, organized the Children's group in 1388. 
Inspiration for It. dancing in WW has come largely from the 
performances of Vancouver, D.C.'s t=arllee hurlane Dancers, all 
amateur, but very accomplished group, who always perform at It. 
Heritage Days. t=olkdanr_e is now, of course, a revived activity. 
The It. Heritage Dancers are aware of the slimness of their 
repertoire. One told me that there used to be a dozen different 
tarantellas. 
Narrative Folklore 
As in most communities affected by TV, radio, the hi-fi, and the 
VCR, ritual or formalized storytelling is dead among Its. 
in WW. 
62 
There are, of course, <sti.l.l. raconteurs. Joe J. 
t_ocati is one of 
these, and he can talk for hours about the history of Its., 
ItAms. , and the local fruit and vegetable industry. Francis 
Christiano, a self-styled history buff, 
is also a good talker. He 
is also knowledgeable on We'ste'rn history in general, Indian lore, 
and antique firearms, which he collects and restores. Charlie 
Paietta is another good talker, and he tells lots of family 
stories. C:army De stito is one of the best 'raconteu'rs, and she can 
and often does expound on It. 
food and home customs. One of the 
best ways to get people talking is to ask them to bring out old 
photos. Luis Rizzuti., although not originally from WW, 
is also 
quite knowledgeable about local. It. history. 
Some WW Valley ItAms. like to tall. It. ethnic jokes, usually 
focusing on SIt. --accented English. Destito tells one a.bout an old 
It. who is having a house built and requests installation of a 
"halo statue." When the builder says he can't find one, the It. 
holds his fist up to the side of his head and says, "Like-a you 
pick up anv -••a 
you say, 
'Halo, 'st' at you?''' 
The most traditional narrator, in a folkloristic sense, seems to 
be Na'ria DaltoEso. She was once known for a large 'repertoire of 
"bedtime stories" brought over from Italy, but could not remember 
any for the interview session. She is in her 805s, 
but says that a 
story will sometime just appear in her mind. SiiingrA Dal.tosso 
knows a number of poetic recitations in It. During the interview, 
63 
she recited the following: 
(love of country) a pat•ri.oti.c poem extolling 
the respective virtues of the different regions of Italy. 
"I1, 
i7v_.aigr2110" 
(the shepherd boy) , a poem about a shepherd boy 
who meets a king on horseback. The king invite's him to live at 
they royal palace. At first the boy enjoys the luxuries, but 
eventually he takes sick when he missies his mother. Only a visit 
from his mother saves his life. 
"For Christmas I Want My Mother," a poem about an orphan girl, 
who, at Christmas time, has no interest in gifts. She only wants 
her deceased mother back. 
A humorous poem about a little girl who is shocked to see her 
new baby brother, bald and toothless. "Why you buy this one, so 
old, without teeth?" Eventually she comes to love him as she sees 
him mature. 
"I7. ppjjvi.o" 
(the chicken coop), a humorous poem about a vain 
peacock who expects the other fowl to treat him as a king, 
because of his beauty. He is rejected because he cannot lay an 
egg a day, like a hen, nor crow at sunrise, like a cock, nor does 
he have the good meat of the ducks. The peacock flees in shame. 
Mrs. Ualtosso recites the poems in It., and then offers a summary 
translation in English. In order to help her remember, she wrote 
them clown on paper before my visit. As with the songs, she 
believes that she learned these recitations as a child in school, 
but she is not really certain where they coma from. 
64 
Language 
Some of the older Its. and ItAms. can still speak It. The 
immigrants whom I met all spoke It., usually heavily influenced 
by the resspeC:tive dialects of their home regions. Some second 
generation ItAms, such as Francis Christiana, speak It. 
In the 
old days it was sometimes difficult for Nlts. and ST.ts. 
to 
communicate, because of language differences, especially if they 
had not had schooling in Italy, which is where the national 
language of Italy (based on the Tuscan dialect) was learned. 
According to Joe J. Locati, it was the Slts. who spoke English 
with the stereotypical. ItAm. dialect, adding an 
-a" to words 
ending in consonants. 
l;;f.?C:ausse of prejudice, many of the 
immigrants and second generation people discouraged their 
children from learning It. 
Fr. Oscar Baldur.c i, founding pastor of St. Francis of Assisi, 
spoke a flowery Florentine, which was hard for both N. and Slts. 
o understand. Bert PesiC:iallo's father Giuseppe, who supplied 
grapes, spoken Genovese, but had a good command of the national. 
language, which he used when communicating with both Lombardi. and 
Calabrese. A number of local ItAms. have kept in contact with 
cousins, and uncles and aunts in the old country, and have 
exchanged 
 visits. 
They have made an effort to learn or sustain at 
least a basic understanding of It. 
65 
Increasing trans-Atlantic travel and revived ethnic consciousness 
created a demand for It. 
instruction in WW during the 1970s. The 
laaY1guage had, of course, been taught in the area's two 4-year 
colleges, Walla Walla College in College Place and Whitman 
College in Walla Walla, and a few people had taken it there. A 
non-ItAm. teacher at Walla Walla Community College (a state 
community college) began to offer it in the late 1970s. 
Dissatisfaction with the tuition system led Richard Campanelli to 
start his own non-curricular It. 
course, which is quite popular 
and attended by many IHA members. It also functions as 
conversaati.onaal. It. club IHA members enrolled in It. sometimes 
take bus trips to various places and use the bus ride as an 
opportunity to practice It. 
Games and recreation 
;C;c qqq 
is dead in the WW Valley. At one time it was a major form 
of recreation among It. 
men. 
It dial not, however, get passed on 
to the second generation. Mon..-It. 
]:sill Burk, director of the Fort 
Walla Walla Nuseum & Histori.cal. Society, and one: of the people 
most responsible for the revival of ethnic celebration in WW, 
bought a Qggqq set for people to use during It. Heritage Days. It 
has not yet been used. The seventeen It. men (and four children) 
gathered at Tony I_ocati's house on a Sunday in the oft-reproduced 
1910 photo, were there: to play tic gyg. Joe J. 
L_ocati says that 
qi qqq a is pronounced "butch" in his family's Lombard dialect. 
In 
66 
the later years of lagc,gg-playing 
(probably the 1930s or 7 40x), 
Qgqqq balls were no longer available and people played the gamer 
with blocks of wood substituting for balls! Horseshoes was 
another game played during the Sunday afternoon gatherings and 
when the weather was had, the men gathered indoors to play cards. 
Its. preferred tradi.tion<:al. It. card games, which f=rank Fazzari 
and others remember being played at The Pastime Cafe on Saturday 
afternoons. Christiana, who remembers b .<2gg1q and ygyp y (?) , 
talks of wanting to revive these old card games too. The men also 
played a common It. 
Came based on guessing 
sing odd or even-numbers of 
fingers being thrust: forward. Pool was a popular pastime. The 
Pastime:' Cafe started as a pool. room (and near-beer joint), only 
serving food in its later years. 
Another It.-owned pool and beer establishment which flourished in 
the 1930s and 1 40s, was the Liberty Pool Hall, also on W. Main 
St., almost next door to They Pastime Cafe. It was also patronized 
largely by Items. Its site is now occupied by a Chinese and 
Polynesian restaurant. 
Material Culture 
The material culture of Items. in WW is not nearly as well-
represented as it is in other ItAm. communities in the West. 
67 
There seems to have been practically no use of It. 
labor in 
building, nor did most It. settlers build their own homes and 
outbuildings. At least this is what I am told. Conversations with 
all. the history-conscious leaders of the It. community have led 
to the same dead sand, 
namely, no, they didn't build anything. Why 
this is so, 
is a mystery, because many had worked as construction 
laborers in Europe, some even on the Alpine tunnels. Furthermore, 
at least of the early It. settlers, including Pasquale 
Saturno/ rank Breen, Richard Campanelli's father, and still-
living 98-year-old Nick Longo had been railroad--building laborers 
in the American West. The It. domination of the building trades 
seen so many other places just does not seem to apply here?. 
According to hearsay, It. 
labor was used in the installation of 
marble in the present Walla Walla County Court House in the 
1902s. No-one seems to know of any local. Its. who worked on it 
and speculation is that they may have brought in It. 
laborers 
from elsewhere. More thorough research into the court house 
building should be able to shed some light: on this subject. I was 
able to locate only two structures definitely built:, by Its. These 
are a shed, built first as a grower's horse--barn, now used as a 
tool shed, in the rear of the home of Jack; Regalia, on Artesia 
St. 
(Fite. 
P, 
Box 415) on the WW city limits. Mr. Regalia, an It. 
immigrant From I_onate Pozzolo, is in his 80s, but is unable to 
speak due to a stroke. The shed is one story, built of wooden 
planks. 
68 
The other It.-built structure is a brick house can West Pine :: t. 
(Pasco Hwy.) 
(Rte. 
5, 
Box 261, now inhabited by the Stever & Cindy 
Sur-kow family)) west of the city limits, built by Joe Grassi 
during the 1930s. Joe Grassi was the only It. 
bricklayer and 
builder earlier in this century. We built a number of houses in 
WW, although this is the only specific one that people remember 
him having built, and it was Mr. Grasssi.'s home. Grasssi'<.s son, 
J. K. , still lives across the street in a modern ranch house. The 
house is a 1 1/2-story semi-bungalow. 
The houses that Joe? Tachi and Saturno/Breen lived in s:sti.11. 
stand. 
They are within the city limits of College Place, 
can its north 
end. Tachi's, on Myra Rd. 
is a rsmall pyramid-roofed four--room, 
surrounded by fields. Tachi.'ss legendary Nlt./Germanic thrift is 
reflected, according to popular wisdom, in the modest house that 
he and his family lived in. Tachi was supposedly the most 
financially successful of the pioneer It. 
growers, although his 
widow's fortune was supposedly wiped out by "the Greek." The 
house belongs to a Locati and is presently rented by a Thai 
immigrant family. 
A large two-story mansion on Larch Ave., College Placer, was 
Saturno/Dreen'ss later home. It is the kind of large symmetrical 
eight--room mansion one often finds as all older farmhouse in the 
Midwestern Corn Belt. It was not S/B 7 s first house. That still 
69 
stands in a little field behind the house, off Tremont Dr. 
It is 
a four-room cabin and next to it is a foundation hole which was 
supposedly once S/B,s original wine and meat-curing cellar. qn 
the S/D property are a large English-style 3--bay barn, a wooden, 
typically Western clapboard-covered water tower, a small. 
four-room house, which was supposedly 
/B's second house, and in 
which his son, Eugene Breen still lives, and a 1 1/2-story 
all-brick structure used as S/T.i's wine-cellar and meat-- curing 
shed. The big house is inhabited by S/B's granddaughter Garen 
Weber and her husband, Sam. 
In the cellar portion of the brick 
structure are S/B's original wine-press, a huge fermentation 
barrel., some aging barrels, wine bottles and a few old wine 
demijohns. Doug Breen Saturno has expressed can interest in 
restoring this building and its contents. 
According to everyone wham l asked, none of the houses on the 
Tachi or the Saturno/Breran property were built by Its. They were 
built by non-It. labor hired, respectively by Joe Tachi. and 
Pasquale Saturno/Frank Breen. 
1 am inclined to wonder whether or 
not S/B himself may have built the original four-room cabin, as 
:it does not look like something you would hire a builder to 
build. 
Other It. material culture included food-preparation, discussed 
above, and the sewing and needlework of 1't. 
women. Fort Walla 
Wallet Museum has some old shawls and dresses from immigrant days, 
some of which were brought from Italy and some of which were made 
70 
in the WW Valley. 
Some of the TtAm. families also have this kind 
of "heirloom" clothing, but T was not able to investigate it 
specifically. ItAm. women who sew and knit, do so in the context 
of popular mainstream American clothing patterns, sweaters, 
af13hans, and the like. 
However, most learned needlework from 
mothers and/or grandmothers. I saw no evidence of the sustaining 
of specifically 
It.-style needlework:, but it may exist.. I may 
not have known the questions to ask. 
Despite the fact that "WW Sweet" anion-growing is still largely 
hand-labor intensive, there seems to be little or no specifically 
It. carryover in its technology. A possible exception is the use 
of a special knife for topping. Curved-..blade knives, called 
t< a,ggl 7
; (?) were used to Cut "junkie" or "zucchi" (?), the reed 
once used for tying bunch-crops. Bland--topping of onions is done 
by a similar knife, made by grinding a curve into a large, 
commercially bought paring knife. Vi.rgi.l. Crisr.ola showed me some 
of these. 
Social. Customs 
Specifically It. 
s>ocial customs have, as might be expected, faded 
with assimilation. When the community was primarily immigrant 
it., there were many siocial occasions that expressed It. 
ethnicity. We have already mentioned the after-church Sunday 
71 
gatherings of extended families at which some played laoccea. 
Children liked these gatherings because they sometimes served ice 
cream, normally an expensive and unavailable treat. Dancing and 
music were also common at Sunday-afternoon gatherings. 
One rather chilling story of an event at a Sunday gathering 
illustrates 
 the low status of girls, the transfer of the system 
of obsequious respect for the ppQrpD2 from they Old World to they 
New, and the way that appropriate punishment then, would be 
considered grows child abuse today. Music_ was being played, 
supposedly on the mandolin, at a gathering at the Cri sr.ola house. 
Present was Joe Tachi., who owned much of the land in that area. 
The story does not indicate whether or not Tachi was the hosts' 
landlord, but they did consider him the pjgrgpq. Tachi asked a 
twelve-year-old Catherine (who later became Charlie Paietta's 
mother and Carrie Locati. Criscola's sister-in-law) to dance?. The 
girl declined, because of shyness. Her mother flew into a raga 
and yelled something about disobeying the p;grgpq. The hapless 
girl was then beaten severely and tied to a table in the midst of 
the party where she was forced to remain standing for six to 
seven hours. As long as she lived, she felt bitterness about this 
incident, in particular that Tachi did not try to intervene on 
her behalf. Evidently he thought that this was an appropriate 
punishment for disobedience. The story was told to me by Charlie 
Paietta and attested by Carrie Locati Crisscola. The story of 
Catherine Criscol.a'si courtship by Vissento Valetta is related in 
72 
the enclosed unpublished story, "Mother's Courtship," by Matilda 
Paie•t:ta Pautler. 
Another story told of the 
1adrgng 1 
s power tells of someone's 
small clog who, when startled, bit Joe T'achi. The clog had to be 
destroyed immediately, causing great sadness to the family's 
children, for whom it was a beloved pelt. 
The low status of women in some of the old It. 
families is often 
alluded to by the older ItFams. 
"Gild woman" was a common term of 
address used by some of the men for their wives. 
It seems likely that most Sunday-afternoon gatherings were 
Lively, enjoyable events, because people who remember them, do so 
fondly. Joe J. 
Locati says that music, dancing, and feasting was 
more common at the Sunday gatherings at Sits.' homes. 
Doqw, 
horseshoes, and cards were among the entertainments and homemade 
bread and home:'--cured hams were consumed. 
Rites of passage would have been major ethnic celebratory events. 
I dial not hear about christenings, first communions, 
confirmations, or funerals, but the old weddings were certainly 
remembered. In l:taalians i.n WA. 
States (pp. 
59-•f,0) 
Nicand•ri talks 
of wedding festivity, including the throwing of coins on the 
floor for children to scramble after. Informants tell that large, 
elaborate weddings, with live music and dancing, and a sit-down 
73 
banquet were not uncommon until the last decade or so, when they 
became prohibitive in cost. Musicians like Stanley Der_cio and 
Virgil Criscola supplemented their income to a considerable 
degree .largely through the wedding trade. After the wedding, 
there was often as 
sshivaree at the place:' where the newlyweds were 
staying.. Francis and Nadine Chri stiano (Nadine is from a local 
German--Russian family) had one of these in the 1940s, with live 
music and dancing. 
Many young It. 
drawers sent to Italy for wives, sometimes relying 
on a matchmaker in their home town, other times going bark there 
themselves. In the earliest days of It. settlement in WW 
marriages were often, if not exactly arranged, than certainly 
facilitated by parents. This was when North-South marriages were 
discouraged by hilts., 
but not by Slats. The delicacy of courtship 
among 'rural people, especially the consideration for the delicate 
feelings of a young woman is illustrated in Matilda Paietta 
Paautler'ss enclosed story, "Mother's Courtship.'' 
Christmas customs have already been discussed in detail in the 
section on food. 
In keeping with traditional It. 
custom, Its. 
celebrated Christmas Eve, called "Vigil." Some had their 
Christmas dinner in the evening, during which , of course, it was 
still a fast day, so meat was not served. Pasta, cheese, and for 
those who could afford it, 
t1pply (dried cod), and even eel were 
served. Afterwards, presents were given out. Most churchgoing 
74 
Its. went to midnight Mass at St. Francis of Assisi. Afterwards, 
more feasting occurred. Fried salami was evidently a customary 
dish. Those.' who had foregone Christmas dinner could have it now, 
and it consisted of a major meat or fowl.. 
Ham, turkey, and pork 
roast were among the food e'ate'n after midnight. Presents were 
then opened, too, although some families only opened a few, 
saving the rest until the 25th. 
It was not uncommon for people to 
be up as late as 5 a.m. celebrating, and some individuals, such 
as guitarist and singer Tony C.hri£stiano, went from house to houcse 
performing for treats, a practice his son, Francis, calls 
carneval.e. 
Today's ItAms. often sti.l.l. celebrate Christmas Ever 
(or night) in 
preference to Christmas Day. "This is the way the kids want it,'' 
is a rationalization. Some also divide: up the gift-giving between 
Christmas Eve and Christmas bay morning. Many still attend 
Midnight Mass or a Christmas Eve Vesper Mass. 
One factor which has kept It. ethnicity alive in certain families 
is contact with the old country. Even in they old days, a number 
of Its., mostly men, went back and forth between WW and Italy, 
despite the high cost and tremendous amount of time this took. 
Some of these trips were spurred by wife—hunting. Immediately 
after World War II, several. local. ItAms. went; back to Italy to 
visit relatives, from whom they had been cut off since Italy's 
declaration of war against the U.S. 
in 1941. After the cheapening 
75 
of air travel in the la te 1960s, visits became more common, and 
as Its. 
in Italy became more prosperous, some of them came to WW, 
as well.. 
The Eliaa family often has visitors from Milan. 
THE ITALIAN ETHNIC REVIVAL IN THE WALLA WALLA VALLEY 
The most: visible manifestations of It. 
ethnic expressions today 
are a direct result of the WW Valley's recent ethnic revival. A 
number of factors led to this occurring. First of all., 
there is, 
of course, a general revival of ethnic pluralism in the U.S., 
which many have traced to the Black Power movement of the 1960s. 
The American Revolution Bicentennial celebrations in 1976 were in 
many cases celebrations of pluralism. The WW UniqnjPgl,jQi.n 
issued a special supplement: in 1976 to celebrate WW ethni.r.. 
heritage. The Spokane :i[)c)• E?£>ntan•FtiE'_V7 f?W, 
also sold in WW, did as 
series of articles on WW Its. 
Many third- and fourth-generation ItAms. went to college in the 
1960s and 1 70s. Influenced by the intellectual currents of the 
time, they came home asking questions about their heritage, and 
wondering why it was no longer observed. Virgil. Crisc.ola's son's 
question why they no longer made wine or sausage is an example. 
This must have been confusing to people who had clone all they 
could to assimilate to mainstream "American - ne srs. 't 
In 1`37G, a group of ItAms. ceremonially rededicated the Columbus 
statue and held 
as 
Columbus Day, which had not been held for 
76 
decades. At that time, there was talk of starting an It. heritage 
society. Bill. Burk, director of the Fort Walla Walla Museum • 
Historical Society at Fort Walla Walla Park, organized some 
exhibitions on ethnicity, focusing on Native Americans, Chinese, 
German-Ru ssians, Its ., 
an d Mexi cans. Burk a lso organi zed 
"Heritage Days" at the mus eum, 
inviting memb ers o f the respective 
ethnic groups to lend items for exhibition. A few individuals, 
such as Francis Christi.ano and Ca'rmy De stito, were especially 
moved to ta ke an interest. Ironically, De.,sstito was not from the 
old It. WW pioneer stock, but came to WW from Spokane, after 
marrying a local truck - gardener. C'h'risti ano'ss wi fe was active in 
the local chapter of American Historical Society of Germans From 
Russia, and Francis was thus familiar with the Concept of an 
ethnic heritage organization. Burk encouraged Ch'risti.ano to try 
to organize an It. 
group. 
The Bi.centennial a lso encouraged an hi storian at Whitm an College 
to invite Joe T. 
I_ocati to come and .lecture on the "ethnics" and 
their contribution to WW history--the "ethnics" being Chinese and 
Its. Evidently he knew that Joe had a great deal of knowledge in 
these matters from his year s as State - Federal Fruit and Produce 
Inspector. This led I_ocati to want to begin to research in 
earnest, which he slid, 
and in 1`J78, he self-published the 282-

The book, which included two major chapters on the Its., caused a 
lot of notice, not the least because it inspired cont'rove'rsy by 
some who disputed Locatils findings. Others then, of course, 
wanted to read it too to see if they could find any inaccuracies. 
In fact, the book is probably quite accurate, although it is 
bound to contain some mistakes. 
Interest seemed to wane Until 1985, when St. Francis of Assisi. 
R.C. Church celebrated its 70th anniversary. At a meeting to plan 
the celebration, Ch'ristlano started trying again, in earnest, to 
organize an It. ethnic club. An ad in the WW UDiqnjPu11gj .n 
attracted seventeen people, including "Campy" Campanell.i, to the 
first organizational meeting. Many old--timers opposed the idea, 
because of past experience with anti"-It. prejudice. 
Ont.".f•.'' 
it was 
decided to establish an organization, people debated whether or 
not to affiliate with the ;ions of Italy. The Spokane Sons Lodge 
mounted a campaign to have the WW Its. establish a lodge there. 
After locals found out that they would have to pay dues to a 
national organization, they opted for an independent association. 
By mid••-1`:386 the Italian Heritage Association was chartered as a 
nonprofit organization registered with the Washington Secretary 
of State and the IRS. Ca'rmy Destito was elected president. 
Campanc lil 
established a monthly newsletter, 
News: Ctua.lche Notizia•-••-A Little Bit of {dews„ 
78 
One of the first acts of the IHA was to establish the Italian 
Heritage Dancers„ Nary iMaanuel. Hartley became the coach, and scant 
away for folk dance books that contained It. dances, which she 
then taught to the group. A Children's Italian Heritage Dancers 
was established in 1988 by two women from the adult group, Mary 
Kleyn (Francis Chrisatiano's daughter) and Cheryl C_andoni Knotts. 
Many local. ItAms. were reluctant to join the IHA at first. 
Christiano, although Catholic himself, insisted that the IHA be a 
secular organization, so that non-Catholic ItAms. 
(of whom there 
are some in WW) would feel comfortable. This raised some 
controversy among some of the more religious Catholics in the 
community. 
Charter membership was available the entire first 
year. As it drew to a close, a large number signed up in the last 
days, seeing that the IHA did not; cause a revival of anti.-It. 
prejudice, and not wishing to be left out of a good thing. 
The WW Chamber of Commerce and the (Main Street Association asked 
the IHA to start It. Heritage Days as a downtown event. The first 
was held in ].`386. 
The organizing chair of It. Heritage Days is 
,Tan Cristofoli Craton, 
formerly of Trail, B.C., a mining and 
smelting community which has a large It. contingent. Carmy 
De:?sti'to's sister in Seattle had seen the F 
amee Furlane dancers of 
Vancouver, B.C. perform, and they were invited. They were the 
main crowd--pleaser. The WW Antique Car Club lent cars for the 
revived Columbus Day parade. The Knights of Columbus organized 
the ceremony at that Columbus statues. 
In 1.988 and -9, the F"amee 
79 
Fu'rlane Dancers brought with them the Vancouver Italian FOIE: 
Chorus. 
In 1986 or -•7, 
the IHA established its sausage:' booth, under the 
direction of Emilio "Millie" Buttice. In the week before :it. 
Heritage Days, a group of men under Buttice'ss direction gather to 
make sausage in a commercial kitchen, using Butti e's recipes for 
"hot" and "mild." A group of women gather with C:a'rmy Desstito to 
make IIt. pastries, which are also scald at a booth. 
The 1".89 festival took the following form: 
Thursday evening, IHA members gathered for a bancac.tr:t at the WW 
Country Club, where the It. 
Heritage? Days Princesses were 
invested. Early Friday morning, IHA members went to First 
Interstate Plaza at the corner of Plain St. and 1st Ave. to set up 
booths. The block of 1st Ave. between Plain and Alder was sparred 
off for the dance area and the booths. 
At 10 a.m., the parade 
stared. This year Joe J. 
1_ocati and Doug Breen Saturno were co---
grand marshals. Various ItAm. and other community leaders rode by 
in antique cars as do the princesses. 
The parade also included 
high school marching bands, fire trucks, Army Reserve, Knights of 
Columbus and scouts. Also included were the Famee Furlane Dancers 
and Vancouver Italian Folk Chorus, and WW's Adult and Children's 
It. Heritage Dancers, all in red-white--and--green costumes. Carmy 
Desstito carried the newly made IHA flag. The parade ended at the 
WW County Court House grounds, where the IHA members and Canadian 
80 
guests filed up on the court house steps for the ceremony. All 
Episcopalian priest gave an invocation. The K. 
of C. 
executed a 
flag ceremony and placed a wreath on the Columbus statute 
pedestal.. 
During the 'refit of the day, there were dance exhibitions by F 
amee 
1=urlane and WW's Adult and Children's It. Heritage Dancers. There 
was live music--accordion solos by David Decci.o and mandolin 
solos by Mel. Butti.ce.. Dave Vennerx sang It. popular songs. 
Speeches were made. 
In between performances, taped of It. 
popular 
music were players. Sausage and pastries were sold and consumed. 
An IHA booth sold souvenir hats, badges and T-shirts. 
In the evening, a spaghetti and meat ball dinner was held at the 
Community Center at the WW County Fairgrounds. This used to be 
held at DeSales Catholic High School cafeteria, but it grew too 
large. There is, however now, no way to prepare the spaghetti and 
meat balls on location at the Community Center, which aggravates 
some. After the dinner, more speeches, and singing by the 
Vancouver It. Folk Chorus and dancing by l=ame 1=urlane. 
Next morning the fessti.val moved to Fort Walla Walla Park for the 
first ever "WW Grape Stomp," organized by Carmy Destito and 
Millie Butti.ce. While Carmy Desti.to announced, teams from various 
businesses, such as the banks, vied to have their mostly 
attractive-legged young employees in short shorts stomp grapes 
81. 
barefoot for five--minute durations. The juice ran out of the vat 
into a bottle, where Millie Buttice measured it and proclaimed 
the winners. Destito first saw "grape stomps" at wineries on the 
Columbia River. 
The sausage and souvenir booths were on the 
grounds selling their wares. Afterwards, there was dancing by 
1=amee 1=u•rl.ane and the WW dancers, and music by the Vancouver 
Chorus. Such was 1989 Italian Heritage Days. 
SOME CONCLUSIONS 
So, 
is It. culture alive in the WW Valley? Yes and no. The 
revival, despite such manufactured events as the "Grape Stomp,'' 
has made pE?C)[)le far more aware of extant survivals, such as foods 
and food-related customs. 
The revival. of It. 
folkdancess from the 
pages of instruction books may not be folk survival, but it is 
certainly a frank expression of It. identity. Nine decades of "WW 
Sweet" onion-growing is more an exampl.e of cultural creativity, 
rather than continuity, as the strain was developed in the WW 
Valley. In fact, truck gardening as a whole, is cultural 
creativity among a people who were not truck-gardeners when they 
arrived from Italy. 
•The same can be said of the now nearly 
extinct practice of home winemaking, which the immigrants had not 
practiced in the old country, but took up enthusiastically in the 
new, where their favored drink was not as easily available. 
Today, of course, many varieties of wine are available in the 
82 
local. supermarket. 
Some manifestations of continuity, such as the deference paid to 
adroni 
and the star' difference 
 in men's and women? s roles and 
status, lasted a generation and were then jettisoned as soon as 
possible by assimilated l.tAms., to whom such customs must have, 
seemed medieval. 
Despite intermarriage between many Nits. & Sits., one aSiF)E'ct of 
continuity is the clear awareness of the differences between 
these two cultures, especially in food, and the love of pcaJ_Erf.Qt 
and Q . 
,r y1p by WW ItAms. of Nxt. ancestry. 
It. revival in the WW Valley is a product of interaction between 
awareness of WW It. immigrant history, limited cultural. 
survivals, and the powerful movement of ethnic: revitalization 
that has swept U.S. popular culture since the early 1970s. It 
came late to the WW Valley, not really establishing itself until. 
the mid1980s, but WW is a relatively isolated community, far from 
urban centers. Joe J. 
l...ocati., 
who had as much to do with it as 
anybody, by writing The I-io•rticul.tgrq _TIiiQgry_, dismissed it in 
May 1` 89, as "a bit of nostalgia," further stating categorically 
that there was no It. ethnic-consciousness in the WW Valley. He 
was, however, proud to be a co-grand marshal in the following 
October's 1989 It. Heritage Day s/Columbus Day parade. 
83 
It is ironic that one of the most assimilating things that local. 
ItAms. could do, namely sending their kids off to universities, 
resulted in these young people coming back with as 
hunger for 
ethnic culture. 
Most (but not all) WW ItAms. are not aware of the distinctions 
between ItAm. popular culture--_ and genuine It. immigrant culture, 
except inasmuch as they know some differences between NIt. and 
SIt. foodways. Many people love to collect records of popular It. 
and ItAm. singer's and think of their reoertoi.re as It. 
folksong. 
An exception is Francis Christiano, who longs for the "authentic'' 
folk songs he heard his late father sing, and which he cannot 
find on record. 
It will be interesting to see how long the IHA lasts. Most of the 
people at its meetings are middle--aged, but there is a small 
enthusiastic core of younger members, too. 
"WW Sweets" will 
probably continue to be as West Coast "gourmet onion," unless 
"white rot" makes it impossible or totally uneC:onomical. to grow 
them. 
Suffice to say, however, that the WW ItAm. community is no longer 
agriculture-based, at least not to the degree that it once was. 
The fact that so many younger ItAms. have entered the professions 
has led many of them to move away from the WW Valley to urban 
centers, and these are the people who most likely would sustain 
84 
organized ethnic-consciousness. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
A larger exhibition on ItAms. 
in the West may not deem it 
important: to use a lot of space on one rather isolated community. 
But featuring of WW ItAms. could be used as an example of 
assimilation and cultural. revitalization. The question then is 
what artifacts are available. I dial not pursue the possibility of 
borrowing any treasured items for a national traveling 
exhibition, but many WW ItAms. might, be flattered to be asked to 
lend, given adequate reassurance of safe return. 
A history of It. 
immigration, ItAm. horticulture, and recent 
ItAm. ethnic revitalization in the WW Valley could be assembled 
using photos, including copies of the old ones in people's 
privates collections (The collections belonging to Joe J. 
and 
Angelica Locati, Tony Ambrose, Doug and Mali. Breen aaturno, 
Charlie and Lillian Paietta, Carrie Criscola, and Francis and 
Nadine Christiano come to mind). There are some great old photos 
of It. gatherings, especially those around the Columbus statue 
and 5t. Francis of Assisi R. C.. 
Church. 
(fiee contact--sheets and 
transparencies in IAW--TL--D-WW and IAW•-JL.•-C•-WW files submitted.) 
Contemporary photos of the church's "Northern Colony" and 
"Southern Colony" stained -glass
 
 windows would work. Also useful. 
would be contemporary photos of It. Heritage Days activities. 
85 
Associated with the history of the Columbus statue are the 
following exhibit possibilities. A photo--mural could be made of a 
ltarge--format--negative, photo of the roar panel of the Columbus 
statue, showing the dedication statement with 
all of its It. 
names. If Doug Breen Saturno would permit it, his father's badge 
from the 1911 parade is a possibility. Likewise Tony Locati's 
slightly later parade badge and red-white-and-green sash, now 
owned by Joe J. 
The original silk Kingdom of Italy flan used in 
1` 11, with the Savoy royal arms on it, 
is still in near-perfect 
condition. It belongs to the Fort Walla Wallet Museum & His>torical. 
Society, a l.oc:al nonprofit group, and is stored at t=ort Walla 
Walla Museum under Bill. Burk? s care. The museum also has some 
shawls and other woman's clothing from immigration days, as do 
some private individuals in town. 
Leftover wi.nemaking equipment includes Pasquale Saturno/f=rank: 
Bre?en's wine-press, fermenting barrel, and some ageing barren :i, 
wine-bottles and demijohns, now on the property of Karen Brenn 
Weber and her husband, Sam. Fort Walla Walla has Bert Pescial.l.o' <-:s 
wine-press, which his father made by modifying a cider press. The 
Milton--Freewater His>torical. Society has his fermenting barrel.. 
Rick Small. of Woodward Canyon Winery in Lowden, WA. has 
Pessciallo'si antique? imported French glass ebulliomete:'r. Pesci.al.lo 
still has some bottles of 1937 wine and 1950s labels from Blue 
Mountain Winery. 
(Ones of the labels was sent to the LC-AFC last 
Tune with my May report.) Gary Figgins of Leonetti's Cellars has 
86 
contemporary commercial winemaki.ng equipment and wind, and a 
board displaying the national and regional prize--ribbons his 
wince have won. 
Regarding onions, when they are in season (late June through 
mi.dRugust), "WW sweets" could be made available. Some could be 
available well into late fall, if they had been stored properly. 
Photos of onion planting, harvesting, and packing and of seed---
onion planting and harvesting and seed-preparation could be 
displayed. 
(There are none of these in the submitted materials, 
other 
 than a few stand-copied snapshots, because I was not in WW 
at the right seasons.) Old and new topping knives are a 
possibility, as are onion sacks (with local labels and logos), 
boxes, and a bin, and a "WW SWEET ONION" yard or roadside sign. 
Likewise advertising posters extolling the "WW Sweet, 
prepared 
by the WW Sweat Onion Commission. 
One of the eighty castings of Tom Moro's "WW Sweet Onion'' 
sculpture, commissioned by the WWGR, could probably be borrowed 
or purchased. Perhaps Locati would lend the lovely watercolor his 
daughter painted of him inspecting onion plants for "white rot," 
a photo of which was submitted to LC;-..RFC last June. 
(The photo of 
the painting was erroneously i. d.' d as Lor.ati. thinning "WW 
Sweets. ") 
Regarding the agri.cul.tural and settlement geography, a map of It. 
87 
settlement areas, showing the "Blalock" and "South 9th areas'' 
marked to show I•tAm. 
property, past and present, is desirable. So 
are aerial photos s howing the onion, asparagus, and other produce 
fields, especially the small holdings in the "Blalock area.'' 
The surviving it. 
foods would be difficult to display, without 
actually having someone there to prepare them on the spot. WW-
made c•rustelli., wa innii 
('), tcrrdilli 
('), and t>>.xzq7.1i could be 
lacquered for preservation and then displayed.

Finally, it would be advantageous to do a little more field

(September) and harvesting (late June through midAu gust), and 
seed preparation (August), to gather first-hand data and photos 
of these activities.
