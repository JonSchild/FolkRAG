BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF TOM WARFIELD. 
THE subject of this short sketch was born in New Or-
leans, La., May 1st, 1845, and his native city was also the 
scene of his entree into the profession which he has since 
followed, and which has proven successful beyond his ex-
pectations. 
Tom has performed in every first class place of amuse-
ment upon this continent, and several years ago became a 
member of Duprez & Benedict's Minstrels, where he filled 
the important position of leading comedian. 
His natural 
wit, dialect and humorous nature aid him in portraying the 
peculiarities of the cotton- field darkey. 
His name has be-
come a 
household word throughout the country, and it may 
be safe to predict a 
brilliant future for this popular come-
dian. 
It is not unlikely that the public will at no distant day 
behold a 
troupe headed .and directed by Tom. lie is devoted 
to his art, and every impersonation is perfection itself, and 
worthy of close study. 
Tom is a 
most skillful banjoist— 
sings a 
very humorous song, and relates an anecdote in an 
irresistible manner. The droll sayings and comic impersona-
tions will long be remembered by the amusement- loving 
public who havelistened to this odd genius, who is now on 
the topmost wave of popularity.

" 
HELEN 'S BABIES ," 
Wuo is it takes our big tomcat 
And throws it in the creek? 
Who is it makes such a 
terrible noise 
When we strive to sing or speak ? 
'Who mashed my watch and filled my hat 
With water, grease and gravies? 
Those noisy little nigger imps, 
We call 'em Helen's babies. 
(711011.1:IS. 
They killed the cat, they shaved the dog, 
Stole the bangs from all the ladies, 
They shot a 
duck, and greased a 
hog, 
Those awful Helen's babies. 
They filled my pipe with powder, 
And thought it was immense, 
To see me blown up in the air 
And fall across the fence. 
They filled my shoes with water 
Enough to float the navies. 
I'd like to catch those nigger imps, 
Those sassy Helen's babies. 
They killed the cat, etc.

SALLY HORNER 'ROUND THE CORNER.

The music of this song can be had at Mns. PAULINE LIEDER'S Pub-
lishing House, No. 60 Chatham Street, N. Y., and will be sent post

THERE'S it little girl that charms 
The world as well as me, 
With her eyes of blue, so sweet and true, 
And heart so free. 
Many hours among the flowers, 
Do I 
pass with her, 
Sallie Horner 'round the corner, 
Little one so dear. 
CHORUS. 
Now I 
wonder as I 
ponder, 
If she's true to me, 
If I'm any of the many 
Will she constant be. 
None completer, none is sweeter, 
In this world of ours, 
Sallie Horner 'round the corner, 
In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how to love her, 
If you only try, • 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye. 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten, 
In the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen, 
As they pass her by. 
Now I 
wonder as I 
ponder, etc. 
She is very shy and merry, 
In her roguish ways, 
I 
adore her more and more, 
In all my love- lit days. 
Always sueing, fondly wooing, 
For her heart divine, 
Sallie Homer 'round the corner, 
Oh ! 
she must be mine. 
Now I 
wonder as I 
ponder, etc.

HOP ALONG, PETER. 
Comic Song by FRAME DUMONT. Sung by W M. COURTRIGH'1". 
OLD Uncle Peter got full last night, 
Looking out the window, saw a 
sight; 
This is the story he told me 
All about the animals he did see; 
Skunk on de wall, blowin' his nose, 
Toads in de grass, wore soldier's new clothes; 
Ducks and gander, and de ole gray nag, 
Playing on do pianer, " Rally roun' de Flag." 
CHORUS. 
Hop along, Peter, hop along, hop alone, 
Hop along, Peter, whar you gwine, 
flop along, Peter, hop along, hop along, 
Owl in de tree, winking and blinking, 
Cats in de pantry, catching mice ; 
Bugs in de attic, playing poker, 
Spider on a 
cobweb, throwin' dice; 
Pigs rehearsing in de swill-tub, 
Ducks in de river, tellin1 lies; 
Bull-frog on de stump, grabbing 'skeeters, 
Bald-headed June bug coaxing flies. 
Hop along, Peter, eta. 
Grasshopper in de barn, singing soprano, 
Big bull- frog singing bass; 
Elephant on de wall, out serenadin', 
Little brown weasel wid a 
wart on his face; 
Coon up a 
tree, sayin' his prayers, 
Nigger eating railroad iron, up-stairs; 
Sally in de garden, lifting peas, 
Come and kiss me, if you please. 
Hop along, Peter, et*.

FUNNY SIGHTS. 
WoAls by FIUNIC DUMONT. Sung by Tot WArtrumn. 
I'vE got a 
little song to sing, so open wide your ears, - 
II 
I'll tell you of the funny sights I've seen these manf 
‘ - 4 
years; 
I 
saw a.bullfrog on a 
fence with an elephant playing tag: 
A 
little dog with his tail so short a 
stump tail he couldn't 
wag, 
I 
saw a 
brickbat hit a 
goat with a 
piece of sour krout, 
I 
saw an egg that hatched a 
mule on a 
spittoon inside out, 
I 
saw enough to make me laugh when I 
saw a 
greenback 
dollar 
Take home a 
drunken pair of boots and a 
policeman by 
the collar. 
Perhaps you think I 
haven't seen a 
hair-pin ride a 
horse, 
Or see a 
steamboat go ashore to drink benzine, of course. 
I 
seen a 
camel chase a 
flea up a 
sour apple tree, 
And play draw poker with an owl so old he couldn't see. 
I 
seen a 
hog whose head was bald, around his head he 
wore a 
wreath, 
I 
saw a 
bedbug dressed in red with a 
bran new set of 
teeth, 
I 
saw a 
cart wheel in a 
mince pie, and a 
man who never 
wakes, 
And when I 
drank some old benzine I 
saw a 
thousand 
snakes. 
I 
saw a 
sardine smoke a 
pipe, and a 
wash-tub go to bed, 
44., 
I 
saw a 
donkey with boxing-gloves s
tanding 
on 
his 
head, 
A 
dish cloth drink a 
pail of milk, and a 
lobster that would 
not die, 
A 
butterfly with real blonde hair, a 
rat with a 
glass eye. 
I 
seen a 
mosquito kill a 
hog by stepping on his ear, 
I 
seen a 
whale take a 
bath in a 
penny glass of beer, 
But the funniest thing I 
ever saw, I 
remember it to this 
day, 
Was a 
grasshopper without any teeth chewing a 
bale of 
— 
hay.

Written by Frocs-tz Dtrmoyr, and sung by Messrs. JOHNSON & POWERS,

I'VE GOT A HEALTHY DARLING. 
Written for and sung by Bmax 
I'VE got a 
healthy darling 
Who weighs three hundred pounds, 
She takes the cake at a 
fat clam-bake 
When she goes waltzing round ; 
Her appetite is numerous, 
Her mouth is large, of course, 
She's death on clams and western hams, 
You bet she is the boss. 
She's witty, and pretty, 
As a 
wild-cat or giraffe, 
No never, hardly ever, 
Will you hear this darling laugh ; 
With freckled feet and voice so sweet 
As the solid rye and rock, 
She is the belle, her ears do swell 
A 
singing on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Fatty Walker a 
sitting in the sun, 
Crying and weeping for her young man ; 
Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your eyes out with your frock, 
The pet of all the neighbors a 
living on our block. 
No wonder she's so healthy, 
Because she's so well fed, 
She's the envy of our neighborhood 
With her great big bullfrog head ; 
She's handy with a 
boxing- glove. 
An oyster stew or pie, 
With a 
base ball bat she killed a 
rat 
A " Coming thro' the Rye ;"

I'VE GOT A HEALTHY DARLING.—Concluded. 
At early morn when the birds would sing 
You'll find my Sally there, 
Dancing round the sweet rose bush 
WitCflowers in her hair; 
The little chippies tootetoot, 
And bounce upon her ear, 
She joins them in their jolly songs 
- 
When she is full of beer. 
She's a 
prancer, and a 
dancer, 
But on singing she'd go broke, 
She struck the key, it was high C, 
I 
thought she was going to choke. 
Her eyelids they've grown faded, 
Tossing freckles to the moon ; 
The neighborhood's gone crazy 
Listening to this dizzy coon.

SING ME THAT OLD SONG AGAIN. 
Sung by STANLEY GREY of the San Francisco Minstrels. 
SING me that old song again, love, 
Telling of memory dear, 
Fain would I 
hear it again, love, 
Whispering of hope that is near. 
Remember the night when we parted, 
You soothed all my sorrows to rest, 
And sang me that song so light-hearted— 
. 
Sing me that old song again. 
Sing me that old song again, love, 
The song that you sang long ago, 
Dearer each gentle refrain, love, 
Murmured sweetly and low. 
Dearly my heart loves to wander 
Backward down memory's lane, 
To the sweet time over yonder— 
Sing me that old song again.

But the cuckoo's song is so sad and still,

PRIVATE OPINION OF TOMMY WARFIELD. 
Written and sung by Tom W ARFIELD. 
KIND friends, if you will listen, I 
will try to amuse you; 
I 
wont keep you long, so your attention please give. 
It's one thing and another that's happened quite lately 
In this great country in which we all live. 
For you know everybody has some sort of hobby, 
Some pet little views of their own to reveal; 
So as its the fashion I'll give you in passing 
The private opinion of Tommy Warfie 
Politics soon will ruin our country, 
And one thing sure, between me and you, 
If the poor had the money that's spent on electing, 
That would be an act of charity that right men would do. 
It would make many a 
happy one and a 
great name for our 
Nation, 
Many a 
bleeding heart soon then would be healed. 
Politicians don't need it, the rich wouldn't miss it, 
That's the private opinion of Tommy Warfield. 
TIM LITTLE PLOWER YOU GAVE ME. 
Words and music by MAcy. 
Sung with great success by II Anny W . 
ROE, with the San Francisco 
Minstrels. 
I'VE been thinking, darling, thinking, of the days now 
past and gone, 
When I 
met you down beside the dear old mill, 
How you told me that you lov'd me and your heart was 
all my own. 
I'm thinking, darling, dreaming now of you, 
And in the shades of evening tears will fill mine eyes; 
I'm lonely, lov'd one, all my journey through, 
For the little flower you gave me it is all I've left to 
prize, 
I'm thinking, darling, dreaming now of you. 
CHORUS. 
I've been thinking, darling, thinking, 
I've been thinking of thee 'fond and true ; 
And the little flower you gave me it is all I've left to 
prize, 
I'm thinking, darling, thinking, 
I 
am dreaming now of you. 
I've been thinking, darling, thinking, of our childhood's 
happy home, 
Where the weeping willows kiss'd the running stream, 
And the memories of the old home ever linger with me 
now,— 
I'm thinking, darling, thinking now of you. 
Sweet angels guard my lov'd one ! guard her evermore 
We'll meet again beyond the jasper sea, 
For the memory of the past will come again a 
happy 
dream ; 
I 
think of you wherever I 
may go. 
I've been thinking, etc.

THE CREAM-COLORED HORSE. 
As sung by HARRY STANWOOD, 2,000 times, with wonderful dulness. 
Ara.—" The Flying Trapeze." 
LISTEN to me, I've a 
sad tale of woe, 
A 
heart-rending story that you must all know, 
Of a 
beautiful girl who had me for her beau; 
To marry we both did agree, 
Our vows were most solemnly plighted, 
And I 
was so happy of course, 
Like a 
cabbage, my hopes she then blighted 
For a 
man on a 
cream- colored horse. 
CHORUS. 
He rode round the ring with the greatest of ease, 
Shot through the hoop like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Stood on his head while his toe he would seize, 
And flip- flapped all over the ring. 
I 
took Liza Jane to the circus one nioht, 
To witness this daring equestrain flight ; 
She applauded so loudly, they all thought she was tight, 
Goodness ! how jealous I 
got 
Says I, " Liza Jane, do be quiet," 
Says she, " you are not my boss." 
Then she hollered for two quarts of pea-nuts 
For the man on the cream- colored plug. 
CHORUS. 
Still the gawk rode around the ring with vehemence, 
Shot through the hoop like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Stood on his head whfle his toe he would seize, 
And flip-flapped all over the ring. 
He came out again with a 
flop and a 
whirl, 
When he came right side up, he winked at my girl ; 
I 
had a 
great notion my cane then to twirl 
At this man in spangles and tights. 
She threw him a 
kiss back so quickly, 
For my feelings she had no respect ; 
And as he rode ' round the circle 
I 
wished that he might break his neck. 
SPOKEN.—But he didn't, for, 
CHORD'S. 
He rode round the ring, with utmost ease, 
Broke paper in the hoop, didn't touch knees, 
Stood on his bald head, and neck- tie would seize, 
This man on the skim-milk mule.

THE CR.EA.M-COLORED HORSE.—Continued. 
When we got home, we'd a 
terrible row, 
I 
called her false-hearted, she'd broken her vow, 
Says she, " quit my sight, I 
an done with you now, 
I'm engaged to the star of the Tina', 
I'll be called on the bills 
Senorita,' 
We will travel together of course, 
I'll do a 
flip-flop on his eye-brow 
As he rides on his cream-colored horse." 
CHORUS. 
Don't touch him, harm him not, the Epizootic he's got, 
The horse talks one way, the feller does not; 
My song is now ended I'll go to my cot, 
Please excuse that eccentric old mule. 
THE CHESTNUT MAN. 
Written expressly for Inn= STANWOOD by the late J. B. Muntsnr 
On, listen to the doleful strain, 
That I'm a- going to sing you, 
About a 
tall Italian, and 
A t
tal that him did cling to ; 
He kept a 
stand upon Broadway, 
Hot roasted chestnuts selling, 
And the stamps he took in every day, 
His pockets all were swelling. 
There was a 
maiden short and fat, 
With feelings soft and tender, 
And she fell in love with the chestnut man, 
Because lie was to slender, 
And he loved her with all his might, 
And called her " ducky honey," 
And sold her chestnuts every night, 
And wouldn't take any money. 
One day this maiden went for to go 
For to see her Italian lover, 
When she fell in front of an omnibus, 
And quickly was run over; 
When the chestnut man beheld the sight, 
And knew she was a 
corpus, 
lie swallowed a 
quart of chestnuts down, 
And died of cholera morbus

One day while walking down the street, 
I

And as she slowly tripped along, 
Her step was light and airy; 
I

And tried to catch her eye, 
But no, she wouldn't have it, 
And I 
quickly passed her by.

She is a 
lovely creature, 
And the boys on her are crazy, 
And all throughout the neighborhood, 
They say that she's a

Her features are so perfect, 
And her form is so complete, 
The other girls are jealous, 
For none with her can compete.

ANNA MARIA CAFOOSELAM JANE. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by Tom W ARFIELD. 
I'VE nearly cried my eyes all out, 
My clothes are getting thinner, 
I'll be bald-headed very soon 
Through a 
girl, I

I

brand new set of teeth 
To chew gum-drops through the day, 
And when she euchered all my stamps, 
Why, from me she ran away.

Anna Maria Cafooselam Jane, 
That is my darling's name ; 
And all the fellows in this town 
Have got her on the brain. 
She's humpbacked, bunion on her toe, 
And a 
double-breasted corn, 
Where is my Anna Maria gone ? 
The fellow she pawned her gizzard to 
Was an artiste in his line; 
lie was by trade a 
catcher of dogs, 
And he got rich in the Summer time. 
He presented her with a 
poodle purl:). 
Her old heart to ensnare; 
lie bought her bad butter for pomade, 
And a 
barrel of red false hair. 
Anna Maria, etc. 
I 
thought at once I 
would die (my hair), 
Or do a 
deed quite rash; 
So I 
rushed right down to my boarding-house, 
And I 
poisoned myself with hash. 
I 
threw myself in a 
fellow's pocket, 
And borrowed his watch—that's funny; 
While the girl she came to a 
terrible end 
By eating brown soap for honey.

THE .
THIN MAN. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written for Tom W ARFIELD, by FRANK DUMONT. 
THE thinnest 
man I 
ever saw, 
Lived over in Hoboken ; 
When I 
tell you all how thin he was, 
You'll think that I 
am joking. 
In a 
key- hole he would often creep, 
Thro' a 
sieve he'd go a 
sliding, 
Bat when the landlord came for rent 
In the gas pipe he'd be hiding. 
CHORUS. 
Tissue paper's very thin, 
So's a 
porous plaster, 
This man he got as thin as gauze, 
He couldn't get thin any faster. 
He never went out on a 
windy day, 
And when he went out 
All the dog i 
would follow him, 
Thinking he was a 
bone. 
One night, while he was sleeping, 
The candle was burning dimly, 
A 
bed-bug grabbed him by the neck, 
And pulled him up the chimney. 
CHORUS. 
He was as thin as milk in a 
bad hotel, 
Or the skin of a 
new potato. 
For exercise he'd take a 
dive 
Through the boles of a 
nutmeg grater. 
One day, while be was prowling, 
In a 
bakery he did go ; 
The baker threw him in the trough, 
And mixed him with the dough. 
They put him in the oven, 
I 
tell you twas amazing, 
They baked him in a 
New Year's cake, 
And passed him off for a 
raisin. 
He was as thin, etc.

BILLY'S MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
Written by PRANK Dumoyr and sung by BILLY BIRCH at the San Fran. 
ciseo Minstrels' Opera House. 
.Wir.a, some one invent or tell of a 
plan 
To get rid of my mother-in-law— 
Some stuff that will kill her as dead as a 
nail— 
I 
won't stand her abuse any more. 
I'm covered with scars and with liniment too, 
And court-plaster's all over my jaw; 
She'll douse me in a 
tub if I 
dare to resist, 
And she takes me to scrub up the floor. 
CFIORUS. 
She's a 
hunkey 
mother-in-law--
She's a " daisy " old mother-in-law ; 
She's the crankiest old " crow " that ever you saw, 
Is the buzzard that Billy calls mother-in-law. 
If home I 
return and the hour is late 
Not a 
word of excuse she will hear, 
But gives me a 
sockdolager right in the eye, 
And bites off a 
chunk of my ear. 
I 
can't give her taffy, no matter how sweet 
Her hand's like the fighter, Jem Mace ; 
Whenever she hits me on top of my nose 
She spreads it all over my face. - 
She's a 
huukey old mother-in-law, etc. 
The house is as hot and as warm as a 
stove 
Whenever she's " bossing " around ; 
She gives me a 
wink, and I 
shut up at once, 
For I 
dare not to utter a 
sound. 
Bullets won't pierce this old crocodile's skin ; 
Fa rather be living in jail ; 
I 
go around town like a 
big yellow dog 
With a 
tin kettle tied to his tail. 
She's a 
hunkey old mother-in-law, etc.

EBER, St. Louis, Mo. 
Written and sung by FINK DU:19NT. 
OH 
I 
the old broken crib's laid aside in a 
room 
Where the dust almost hides it from view ; 
Oh ! ' tis many years ago since it saw the light of day; 
And the old-fashioned cradle then was new. 
Little baby heads have rested slumb'ring in this little bed 
While my mother sang and moved it to and fro; 
And my sisters and my brothers, whom I 
ne'er shall see 
again, 
Were rocked in this old cradle years ago. 
CHORUS. 
Rock ! rock ! rock ! mother's voice I 
hear 
Singing baby songs so sweet and low; 
Her loving form I 
see, watching while the baby sleeps. 
And she rocks this little cradle to and fro. 
Oh! I 
love the broken crib for the sake of other days, 
For the sake of my mother gone above; 
Who kissed my eyelids down, and she taught my little 
pray'r, 
'Twas the kiss of my mother's boundless love. 
She often watched beside it to protect us from all harm, 
And with anxious care each motion seemed to be ; 
Oh I ' tis sacred for the mearies that it brings my lonely 
heart, 
The old-fashioned cradle's &ar to me. 
Rock ! rock ! rock! etc.

When they place her 'neath the sod 
Upon which we often trod,

Then close by my 'Cloie's side 
This poor form will there abide,

USED TO OWN A DONKEY. 
Words by BEN. COLLINS. 
Sung by M ANCHESTER and JENN•DiGS. 
I 
USED to own a 
donkey, 
A 
bob- tailed stubborn cuss, 
He was born around the Spring of '49. 
His hide was full of scars 
From stopping railroad cars. 
He had blind staggers, he was ringboued, deaf and blind, 
He could kick like a 
steam engine, 
He could raise you through the roof 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs. 
But he died at half- past four, 
He has gone to that beautiful shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS. 
Davy's left the stable 
For that promised land; 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn. 
No more he'll ever chew, 
They have turned him into glue, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's departed. 
IIis hoof was like a 
sling shot., 
lie could drive it through a 
wall; 
he'd come into the house and kick you out of bed, 
His feet was full of bunions, 
lie could eat a 
barrel of onions, 
And go to sleep standing on his bead. 
He'd go in a 
saloon, stick his foot into a 
spittoon, 
Kick the bar into the street, just for a 
joke. 
When he laid down and died, 
All the mules in Jersey cried, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's croaked. 
CTIORUS . 
He's gone to be an angel 
With spit- curls on his brow; 
He died with epezoodic in the head 
He was to go to Congress, 
With all the other mules, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's dead.

THE GOSPEL RAFT. 
Written by FRANX DUMONT. 
Dedicated to Mn. ABOHIE WmTs. 
i'SE gwine to cross the river on de gospel raft, 
Like Noah in de good ole ark; 
• 
Keep your candles all a-burning; keep (Tern burning all 
de time, 
Or you'll lose yourself and tumble in de dark. 
Get your baggage on de craft, don't-lorget to get . 
your 
check ; 
You've got to pay your passage right to- day; 
Be sure de money's good, for de captain's eye is sharp, 
You can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
CHORUS. 
Hide away, hide away; dar's no use trying to hid-e 
away; 
Get your baggage on de craft, 
Don't forget to have it checked, 
For you can't sneak aboard and hide away. 
Let me tell you about de army Mr. Pharaoh did command 
When he followed ole Moses long ago; 
They was drowned in de water wid their life preservers on, 
And de fishes had a 
jubilee below. 
Dar was Jonah was a 
fool and as stubborn as a 
mule; 
But de whale he made him quickly disappear; 
Jonah den pulled out a 
razor and he cut de whale in half, 
And he floated to de shore upon his ear. 
Hide away, etc. 
Now, take warning, little children, don't you fool about 
de raft, 
For de opposition boat is running too ; 
But she's liable to burst her boiler any time at all, 
And you niggers will be cooked into a 
stew. 
I'se got a 
private box and an opera glass to see 
You sinners trying to buzz in at de door ; 
But dey'll kick you down de stairs if you hasn't got de 
grace. 
If you come back dey'll slap you in de jaw. 
Hide away, etc.

RIVAL FROGS. 
Words by FRANS DUXONT. Sung by TOM W ARFIZI,D. 
THERE was a 
little frog that lived in a 
swamp, 
And a 
hunkey little frog was he; 
He'd sit on a 
stump in the glimmer of the moon, 
And wink at an owl in the tree. 
He fell in love with a 
fat widow frog, 
But a 
rival soon came around, 
A 
cross-eyed frog with corns on his feet, 
Who sang bass from a 
hole in the ground. 
This hunkey little frog soon jealous got, 
He commenced to grieve and to fret, 
For the cross-eyed frog would skirmish in the rain, 
To the widow's house, you bet. 
But this frog on the log did wait one night, 
Smashed his moot and then he dusted, 
The cross-eyed frog took a 
dose of fusil oil, 
He swelled up like a 
bladder and busted. 
The hunkey frog then went on a 
bust, 
And drank a 
gallon of lager beer, 
He got entangled and fell in a 
heap, 
For his stomach felt so queer. 
A 
big buck nigger came that way, 
And this frog he soon espied, 
He scratched on the back of his head, 
tAnd pe2led off all his hide.

IN 
childhood's happy hours, many a 
happy day I 
spent, 
Down by the old mill stream ; 
When we used to go together I 
never shall forget, 
We would laugh and chat and dance upon the green. 
But them days have passed away, and my hair is turning 
gray, 
And it fills this darkey's heart so full of pain, 
When I 
think of my younger days, when I 
would stroll 
For to swing upon the old gate near the lane. 
CHORUS. 
But them days have passed and gone, and our hearts it 
is forlorn, 
For the good old days will never come again ; 
When we used to go together, and pass down by the 
lawn, 
For to swing upon the old gate near the lane. 
Well do we remember, when our daily work was done 
The songs old invmsa he would like, 
And he would play us lots of music, and we have such 
fun, 
For to see them all ti-walking for that cake, 
But the cruet war broke out way down in the sunny 
South, 
And we had to leave the cotton fields and roam ; 
And then we bid good-bye, with tears in our eyes, 
To the old wooden gate that's near the lane. 
But them days, etc. 
MY BABY. 
As sung by CHARLET Thtextrs at the San Francisco Minstrels' Opera 
House. 
I'm the father of an infant 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
He won't let me rest an instant, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
He won't do a 
thing he's bid, 
How I 
wish that I 
was rid 
Of that awful sassy kid, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
Of that awful sassy kid, 
Baby mine. 
At my meals I 
have to hold him, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
How I 
never dare to scold him, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
My face he'll surely scratch, 
And the table- cloth he'll snatch, 
All my crockery goes to smash, 
Baby mine, baby mine, 
All my crockery goes to smash, 
Baby mine. 
He's a 
pimple on his nose, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
And we wash him with a 
hose, 
Baby mine, baby mine ; 
You'd ought to hear him roar, 
And I 
have to walk the floor, 
And I'd like to break his jaw, 
Baby mine, -baby mine, 
Yes, I'd like to break his jaw, 
Baby mine. 
In my hair he often lingers, 
Raby mine, baby mine; 
With molasses on his fingers, 
Baby mine, baby mine; 
To hear him cry it is a 
sin, 
To quiet him we'll begin, 
Till at last we find a 
pin 
Sticking in baby mine, 
Till at last we find a 
pin, 
Baby mine. 
LITTLE CHILDREN, KEEP FISHING. 
Written by FRANS. DUMONT., 
Sung by To W ARFIELIL 
IF you want to wear the golden Crown, 
And trabbel to the sky, 
You want to go and be baptized, 
Go to glory when you die. 
For de devil's standing at your back— 
So, sinners, do take care— 
lie will make a 
dive and catch you sure, 
And grab you by de hair. 
CHORUS. 
Little children, keep fishing, 
Keep fishing), 
keep fishing. 
Little children, keep fishing, 
Keep fishing in the Gospel Pond. 
Aunt Hannah's going down de crooked road, 
git home by and by. 
Uncle Peter going to heaven sure, 
For he never told a 
lie; 
Old sister, shake old Satan down 
And hit him wid some rocks ; 
Don't put a 
pewter five cent piece 
In de contribution tax. 
Lillie children, keep fishing, etc.

OUR PRESIDENTS, 
Sung with great success by Tom W AIIFIELD. 
PEnnArs it may be well enough 
In these the present times, 
To name our Country's Presidents 
In a 
few appropriate rhymes. 
To begin with we will take the first, 
The most highly honored one, 
The Father of our Country, 
The immortal Washington. 
Next Adams, and then came Jefferson, 
A 
statesman of high note, 
Who the immortal Declaration 
Of our Independence wrote. 
The next was Jimmy Madison, 
Who whipped Johnny Bull, you know, 
In the war of eighteen hundred twelve, 
And then came James Monroe. 
John Quincy Adams was the next; 
And then the old war horse, 
Bold Hickory Jackson, came along 
And showed them who was boss. 
Van Buren next hung up his hat 
On the Presidential rack; 
But Tip and Ty came along by and by 
And run him off the truck-, 
( 
I ) 
" • 
OUR PRESIDENTS.—Concluded. 
They served four years between them both, 
And then came James K. Polk; 
With Taylor next, who died and left 
Fillmore to bear the yoke. 
Next Franklin Pearce beat Scott, you know, 
In eighteen fifty-two; 
Who was followed by Buchanan, 
Who the next four years put through. 
The next was good old honest Abe, 
Who met a 
tragic end; 
Andy Johnson took his place, 
And proved the people's friend. 
This brings us down to U. S. Grant, 
And in summing up I 
find 
There was more stealing under him. 
Than all the rest combined. 
Next Rutherford B. fell in line, 
Though put in by a 
fraud; 
Ile served four years most faithfully 
And left a 
good record. 
Next James A. Garfield was the choice, 
And while ruling this glorious land, 
Ele was stricken down in the prime of. life, 
By the a&esgin'i band.

Great Shout Song, sung by Haverly's Minstrels.

Copyright, 1830, by Mrs. PKULINEEDER,. All rights reserved.. 
FsE gwine to write a 
letter 
To my great Jehovah, 
I 
want to know de time 
When de boat am going over. 
Fse got a 
quill from an angers wing, 
'Twos sent to me by de great good King. 
An angel dropped a 
tear in my hand, 
'Twos silver ink at de King's command. 
For a 
sheet oh paper a 
cloud he sent, 
So I'll write Him a 
letter and get his consent to— 
CHORUS. 
Open up dem doors, 
Oh ! break off de hinges, 
Open up dem doors, 
Keep 'em open, 0! Lord. 
Fling dem doors wide open, 
For I 
want to get a 
glimpse inside; 
Fling 'em open, for 
I 
want to get a 
glimpse inside. 
Dat tear turned to a 
ribber, 
Down de mountain flowing, 
rse gwine to build a 
raft, 
On to Jordan I 
am going. 
So from de cloud I 
will make a 
boat, 
And down de stream I 
is gwan to float; 
De silver quill I'll take for a 
mast, 
I'll blow my horn wid a 
Gabriel blast, 
Den I'll done go butcher my fattest calf, 
And I'll send to de Ruler a 
quick telegraph to— 
Open tip dem doors, etc.

DE HUCKLEBERRY PICNIC. 
Composed by PRANK DUMONT. Sung by Tom Wranyntias. 
Published by J. F. PERRY & Co., Boston, Mass. 
I'm floating along on de wings of peace, 
I 
feel just as slippery as axle grease; 
Go tell Ulysses to fetch along Saul, 
There's lots of room for the short and tall. 
We'll pass you in, it won't cost a 
cent, 
No landlord around to collect the rent; 
It's free to all to examine de ground, 
Don't dodge de hat when it's passed around, 
CHORUS. 
Come, join de huckleberry picnic, 
It's going to take place to-day; 
I'se on de committee to invite you all. 
I 
ain't got long to stay. 
The wicked stands in a 
slippery plce, 
A 
good man always holds an ace; 
If you cross the river put on your gown, 
Swim like a 
fish and you'll surely drown. 
A 
policeman's like a 
wicked sin, 
If you don't look out he'll swoop . 
you in; 
Denounce dishonesty of every sort, 
But steal like an artist, don't get caught.

KEEP STUDYLICG, 
BANJO SOLO. 
Written by FRISK Dummy'. for Tom WesFist" 
Now, Daniel was in the lion's den, 
And he nearly lost his breath; 
If my mother-in-law was in that den, 
She'd talk them lions to death. 
Lot's wife was a 
trusty body, too, 
She'd go and tattle the news, 
But she was turned into a 
pillar of salt, 
Away up in Syracuse. 
What makes this earth revolve and turn, 
While ever solid on the ground ? 
It's like a 
grindstone with a 
crank, 
And niggers turning it around. 
In old Noah's ark there was a 
pair 
Of animals from land and sea ; 
Now, tell me where did he put the big whale, 
The polecat and the flea ? 
Who made the railroads and steam-engine, 
Who made the telegraph ? 
'Twas the man that kept a 
studying, 
You bet two dollars and a 
half. 
Who stole into that chicken-coop, 
Grabbed a 
chicken and off did run ? 
That man had better keep studying 
About that farmer's loaded gnu.

THE ZOOLOGICAL DAMSEL, 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by EDWIN FRENCH, San Francisco Minstrels. 
THERE'S a 
gal lives in this city 
Of a 
very peculiar shape, 
She's something like a 
lizard, 
Or a 
big Brazilian ape; 
Her hair is full of feathers, 
And the color of a 
mole, 
And she carries in her slippers 
A 
couple of tons of coal. 
CHORUS. 
For she's so obtropulons, all the way from Indianapolis, 
Her nose, like a 
barber's pole, red, white and blue, 
And she could hold faster than a 
big mustard plaster, 
She'd skip o'er the gutters like a 
lame kangaroo, 
She was born way down in China, 
And you ought to see her laugh, 
She'd shake the freckles off her face, 
Stretch her neck like a 
giraffe ; 
She used to be a 
mummy, 
An her daddy was a 
miller; 
She followed Barnum's circus, 
And was mashed on the gorilla: 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she was so lanky, egotistical and cranky, 
She wore a 
big blanket to cover her breath; 
All " Murphys" %would puzzle when beholding her 
guzzle ; 
She could talk any deaf and dumb feller to death. 
She had her picture taken - 
On a 
slice of Switzer cheese, 
So each time that you beheld it 
You'd get a 
healthy breeze. 
She'd make a 
meal of garlic, 
And if you ever got a 
whiff 
You can bet your bottom dollar 
It would knock you cold and stiff. 
CHORUS. 
I 
repeat quite emphatic that she was a 
loon-a-tie— 
Her head it was hollow and light as a 
cork; 
She's a 
dismal old " corpus "—graceful as a 
porpoise— 
. 
In walk and in talk she's a 
big Jersey gawk.

I LOVE THE LADIES. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by Tox W ARFIELD. 
SCOTLAND, France and Germany 
Are noted for their lands 
But Cincinnati is the place to go 
For yellow-covered hams. 
Boston's noted for her beans, 
Made greasy so they'd slip, 
But Allegliany's the place to go 
To catch the Pittsburg grip, 
CHORUS. 
I 
love the ladies— 
They are a 
puzzle— 
I 
love bull dogs— 
When they are muzzled, 
I 
love lemonades, 
I 
love chambermaids, 
But potwrestlers they are the girls for me. 
The Italian loves to play the organ ; 
While the young ones play the fid; 
While the monkey sits upon the box 
And smiles at all the kids. 
If you want to hear sweet music 
Take the cake clean off the griddle, 
Go to a 
shindig on Saturday night 
And hear some terrier play the fiddle. 
I 
love the ladies, etc.

DEAD BEAT. 
BANJO DUET. 
Now kind friends, we'll sing of the chaps, 
That you all know, that is perhaps ; 
You sometimes meet them on the streets, 
I 
mean the fellows you call dead heats. 
CHORUS. 
For talk is cheap and money buys land, 
Now watch the pauper's eye. 
They dress so neat and look so fine, 
They are always around about lunch time ; 
They always drink but never treat, 
I 
mean those fellows they call dead beats. 
For talk, etc. 
Their collars fu.e turned when out they walk, 
Their stockings are whitened with chalk ; 
They cheat the bootblacks on the street, 
And as I 
pass they holler dead beat. 
For talk, etc. 
Now when we go to take a 
drink, 
They are always first to take the wink ; 
It's sometimes whiskey, and sometimes ale, 
And they've always got a 
lunch route for sale. 
For talk, etc. 
Now, kind friends, I 
bid you adieu, 
Another night I'll sing to you ; 
But if you meet us on the street, 
Don't say that we are dead beats. 
For talk, etc. 
DEAL WITH ME KINDLY. 
DEAL with me kindly, cheer my young heart; 
I'll follow thee blindly wherever thou art, 
Deep in the mountain far from my home, 
I'll follow thy path wherever thoult roam. 
Thy way shall still be mine, 
My heart shall still be thine. 
CHORUS. 
Deal with me kindly, cheer my young heart; 
I'll follow thee blindly wherever thou art. 
Break not my spirit, think of my youth, 
Cherish my tender heart, doubt not my truth 
Friends may desert thee, sorrows may come, 
But still in this soul thine image will bloom. 
Thy hopes with thee I'll share, ' 
Thy wants shall be my care. 
Deal with me kindly, etc. 
COLONEL BLUE FROM KALAMAZOO. 
GREAT MTLITARY SONG. 
Sung at Mitchell's Theatre, St. Louis, by HARRY -W OODSON. 
FROM Kalamazoo, a 
week or two 
I've come my friends to see, 
And have a 
jolly spree, 
For that is what suits me. 
At home you know, I'm all the go, 
No matter what I 
do. 
Yes, all the go, no matter what I 
do in Kalamazoo, 
The pride and pet of the regiment Fifty-two, 
The flower of all Kalamazoo, 
Commanded by Colonel Blue, 
Now don't forget when the city I 
pass through, 
All stop my style to view, 
Quite charmed with Colonel Blue. 
CHORUS. 
I'm Colonel Blue from Kalamazoo, 
Out on review, a 
week or two before I'm through, 
I'll show to you I'm something new, 
That's what I 
do; for Colonel Blue, 
He's one of the few, so brave and true 
Yet festive to his noble crew.

OH ! MY JENNIE! OH 1 
SWEET JENNIE! 
' 
Partly written and composed by W. H. DELEIIANTY. 
OH my Jennie! Oh! my Jennie, 
Time flies quickly by ; 
Sure the lanes will have their turnings, 
Tho' the travellers die. 
Mark the swallow's flight, oh, Jennie, 
Pointing to the sky— 
Waiting as my love waits, Jennie, 
Till the clouds go by, 
Looking like my love looks, Jennie, 
Till the clouds of care go by. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my Jennie! 
Oh, sweet Jennie, 
Time flies quickly by; 
Bear with me in patience, Jennie, 
Till he clouds go by, 
Bear with me in patience, Jennie, 
Till the clouds of care go by. 
As the dew is to the flowers, 
E'er the sun at morn 
Kisses off its magic power, 
And leaves the rose forlorn, 
So am I 
without thee, Jennie. 
Heavy comes the sigh, 
But prayer will lighten sorrow, Jennie, 
Till the clouds go by; 
Joy . will come to-morrow, Jennie, 
When the clouds of care go by. 
Oh! my Jennie,- etc.

I'M THE BOY THAT'S BOUND TO BLAZE 
• 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SEELLT. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cants. 
Mr parents are wealthy and live in style 
In a 
mansion of their own ; 
They dote upon me, and if faults they see ; 
They will never make them known. 
Some chide me and say in a 
gentle way, 
" 
You must change your careless ways ;" 
But it ne'er call be done, for while life is mine, 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze. 
Bound to blaze, bound to b'aze, bound to blase. 
CHORUS. 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze; 
While l'm living I 
must be gay; 
My pa is rich, and my nia don't care, 
And I'm bound to blaze away. 
They say I'm so naughty! the girls I 
mean, 
But they only speak in fun; 
They know what a 
man of the world I'm am, 
And the hearts I've lost and won. 
I'll do as I 
please, understand, my boys; 
Let the world give scorn or praise; 
For evil or good I 
will be a 
blood— 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
I 
know all the sports, and the sports know me, 
And I'm welcomed everywhere; 
I 
handle the " ribbons" so wild and free 
All the people stop and stare. 
I 
drive thro' the Park when the day is bright, 
With my pair of shilling bays ; 
Sensation is ever ray heart's delight, 
And I'm always bound to blaze. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
I 
go to the races and bet my pile, 
Win or lose, it's all the same, 
For when you're in Rome you must feel at home, 
Never mind theluture blame. 
Sometimes I 
awake with a 
great headaeho, 
And my fancy backwards strays ; 
"No matter," I 
say ;. " this is just. 
the way 
Wheria, fellow's bound to blaz'e." 
I'm the boy, etc.

PARODY ON WIDOW DUNN. 
Sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Dedicated to HIERTNTON and HART. 
I 
K.Now a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A-making beds for horses that are sick. 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer; 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey ; 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary. 
She's a 
lamb, I 
mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off 
Widow 
Dunn. 
She4iteals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobatic, break-neck son of a 
gun, 
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And has well-developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She fires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn, 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is saukey, 
She's consumptive, she is craukey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
obromo is the big fat Widow Dunn.

GOOD-BYE, SUNNY HOME. 
Suns/ lq the I'V'Esrox BROTHERS, in their original music act, entitled, 
Mother and Son." 
W HEN the mocking bird was singing, 
Many months ago, 
And the sweet magnolia blossoms 
Grew as white as snow, 
Then I 
never thought that sorrow, 
Death nor pain would come 
To disturb my boyhood pleasure, 
In that sunny home. 
CHORUS. 
I 
must leave thee, still I 
leave thee, 
Sadly I 
must roam; 
I 
must leave thee, still I 
leave thee, 
Good-bye, sunnf home. 
Roses blossom, violets blooming, 
Round that cottage door, 
Where the birds that sung so sweetly, 
Sing, alas, no more. 
But, oh, my poor heart sinks within me, 
As I 
turn to roam, 
Far from those I 
loved and cherished. 
In that sunny home. 
I 
must leave thee, etc,

And I
