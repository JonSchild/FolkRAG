I: 
All right. Well, M, thank you, again, for agreeing to do this interview. We’re thrilled about the Archie 
Green project because I think it’s one of the first times that personal care workers and people who support 
them have had a voice and can tell their stories. So, we’re really interested in hearing your story, and I’m going 
to start right at the beginning, and just ask how you got into this work. I know that you are an adult foster care 
home owner, but prior to being an owner you worked as a personal care aide or worker for family members 
and then at another AFC. So, if you could just tell us a little bit about that journey that would be great. 
P: 
My mother was the caregiver for our family [59.58], our extended family, so kind of following my mom 
as she took care of my grandparents and great aunts and uncles. I started in high school to care for my great 
uncle, to give my mom a break, and also because he wanted company, and it was a nice job. My first paying 
job. So, to clean for him, cook for him. I would do some personal care—rubbing a lot of garlic on his knees for 
his arthritis. That was his treatment that he believed in, and a lot of things like that, checking the nitro pill 
supply all the time on his t-shirts [laughs]. But then after college I worked as an environmental professional, so 
it was when I stayed home with my children that a friend asked to help care for both her developmentally 
disabled daughter and then later her mother. And that’s when I started to do personal care for pay, and later 
I—so that started in 2012, and that same year Crosairs put a sign up in my neighborhood, which was at that 
time a four-person elder care. So, I stopped to talk to the owner because it was just two miles down the road, 
and I said I’m gonna give this a try. It’s something I could do and still be with my kids most of the time, and 
then from there I started to get personal—my own clients—my own private clients. 
I: 
So, you mentioned you were an environmental professional, that’s sort of the new twist on a PCA story. 
Can you talk just a little bit about that? You worked, as I understand it, with the state government for quite a 
while before— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--before starting—before doing PCA work for the local AFC? 
P: 
Yes. For 15 years I worked for the State of Michigan. Started out in water quality, and then air quality, 
and then I specialized in environmental enforcement. 
I: 
Okay. And you were working for the AFC, and then taking some of your own clients on the side? 
P: 
Yes. Going to their homes and helping them, mmm hmm. 
I: 
And then at some point in time you decided to have your own place. 
P: 
Yes. I have had one client for 5 years now, and I was going to large facilities to provide care. I was 
employed by her family not by the large facilities [57.23] and just seeing that environment—having to be in that 
environment a lot, and as she went from one facility—for instance we went from assisted living then to memory 
care, and then we went to a new memory care facility, and then another memory care facility. Two of those 
facilities changed ownership, so I had the experience with, you know, four different companies—being in their 
facilities, and at some point, just saying to myself, there’s such a need for a small facility to take care of people 
that don’t really fit—their needs aren’t necessarily met at a large facility. That’s when I decided I wanted to do 
this, and also with the role model of Crosairs. It was for people initially under the license, and then I also came 
back and worked when he had a six-person license. It just seemed like that was the right way to deliver care 
on a very small scale of either 3 to 1 or 1 to 6. One caregiver per six elders. 
I: 
So, owning your own place like this, which is called the Shine House. 
P: 
Mmm hmm.

I: 
It’s huge. It’s a huge undertaking. I imagine it’s rather life consuming, and as I understand it, it was 
quite a process to get all of the approvals and to set up in a neighborhood like this. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you talk just a little bit about what drove you? You know, what kept you going? What inspires you 
to have a place like this? Just some of the underlying philosophy, and how you feel you can make a difference 
by putting that philosophy in place here at Shine House? 
P: 
I decided I wanted to do this, and because of my age I wanted to get started right away, and I figured I 
had basically 10 years to continue working before I’d like to retire. So, with an AFC, the licensing requires that 
you either rent or own—excuse me lease. You have to have a signed lease, or you have to own a property 
before you can apply for the licenses, so for that reason I purchased this home in 2015. So, that’s something 
that’s a little bit different in terms of start-up for a small business because you have to have the property at the 
beginning before you go to the local zoning board or anything. But what kept me going was that I had met a 
number of really outstanding caregivers/care partners that I thought I can do it with their help because I have 
less experience as a care partner, but I wanted to create a space. And to me that’s more my strength is being 
able to put it all together, having worked with government I knew I could get through the licensing. So, it was 
my network at church and friends and the care partners that I knew that kept me going because it did take a 
long time. The main hiccup we had was that my general understanding was I did not need local zoning 
approval because small group homes are exempt. But the local planner for the township was not aware of that. 
I asked the licensing contacts I had at the State of Michigan to help me identify what that exemption is, and 
they could not provide me with any information. So, we started down the road of public hearing, public meeting 
for a special use permit. So, I would like to also be able to share with individuals that start small homes, you 
know, be able to provide assistance to them, and that’s one thing I can give them, that citation right away, so 
they don’t waste time doing that. 
I: 
I wonder if it’s local, specific, you know? Some areas—townships. 
P: 
No. It’s a state—it’s the State of Michigan states that you do not [53.04] need one for a small group 
home. It’s to be looked at as any other residence. So, not so much as a business, but it’s a residence. 
I: 
Okay. Let’s talk about language just for a minute because I’ve been referring to personal care workers 
as PCAs—personal care aides, and you’re referring to them—I think we’re talking about the same thing—
you’re referring to them as care partners versus caregivers. Can you talk just a little bit about language—the 
importance of, you know, how we refer to this type of work? 
P: 
Well, my references come from my work experiences at Crosairs—a six-person elder care, and TW, the 
owner and administrator has a Master of Social Work, very experienced. So, most of my learning is based on 
my orientation with T, and his philosophy, which I believe is a good idea that you’re not really a caregiver so 
much. You’re not giving care, you’re a partner in the delivery of care. So, it’s you and the elder are partners in 
providing them with the best care in helping them to do all they want to do in their life, so that they can be in 
control of their lives. So, just being a partner in their life. 
I: 
So, that’s what you would prefer to be called? 
P: 
I think it’s important just to acknowledge that that is something to consider, that we’re not just providing 
care—giving care, that it’s a two-way street. So, just want to get that message out there. 
I: 
It’s an important message. It is, indeed. 
P: 
I often say caregiver, so.

Melinda Shine. Haslett. 2.24.18

I: 
Yes. Well, you know, we’ve been using PCA. The title of this project uses the word PCA. PCAs in 
Michigan have something to say. So, I think language is important. Another thing that’s important—you 
mentioned that your clients weren’t able to get the kind of care that you felt they needed in a larger institutional 
setting, and I know you’ve talked a lot about why you feel it’s so important to have a place like this in a 
neighborhood setting. You know, what are the benefits of that? How does that enrich the clients’ lives? Can 
you talk a little bit about that? 
P: 
Well, two things. I think some people—some elders can’t really flourish in a home environment if the 
care ratio is 1 to 10. You know, 1 caregiver to 10 elders. I think the state maximum is 1 to 15. It can’t exceed 
that, so it’s two things. I think often some people—some elders need care in a more intimate basis where they 
know their caregivers, and they receive more attention from their caregivers because the caregiver has less on 
their plate. They can spend more time if the ratio is 1 to 3 or 1 to 6, and then, secondly, what I think Shine 
House has to offer is that it is in a neighborhood [49.42], so it allows an elder that chooses to live here to still 
feel like they’re living at home. They watch the daily rhythms. They see the postman come and deliver the mail. 
They see the kids running up and down the road or, actually, we have a path between the houses, which is 
neat. So, the kids go right through the front year. They’re welcome to do that. We shovel that, and it’s just 
watching—still being part of the life, you know, what most people are used to—life’s daily schedule being the 
kids walking to school. The bus—because we’re so close, the bus doesn’t come into the neighborhood, but it’s 
just such a way to reflect on life, and still feel like you’re a part of it. And it is familiar. It’s familiar. 
I: 
So, what’s—can you talk a little bit or provide some stories about really rewarding—what’s been most 
rewarding about doing both care partner work, but also being an AFC owner? What has been most 
challenging, and what has been really rewarding? 
P: 
Well, in terms of being an AFC owner, what’s been most challenging is the marketing aspect, which I 
have, you know, I was counseled that—mentored that I needed to spend quite a bit of time on that. That’s not 
something that I have a background in nor is it my strength. I’m not comfortable with self-promotion, and just 
going out there and talking to people about it all the time. I’d rather be here providing care and being in the 
home. Initially, it felt like a challenge trying to—when we were going down the path of having a special use 
permit approval, also I found that to be difficult, that I tried to canvas the neighborhood and speak to the 
residents. And I found that to be quite difficult just based on my own personality. Some of the very positive 
parts of this process have been the immediate neighbors—just having people that I don’t know very well 
wanting to get to know me and allowing me to become part of the neighborhood and being very inclusive 
[47.17]. That’s been a wonderful—very wonderful for me. And so, I’m a person who enjoys being at home, and 
so I like being here, you know [laughs]. 
I: 
You’re doing fine. How about—related to the personal care work, the care support work, what do you 
think are some of the biggest challenges for this kind of work, and what brings people into it? What’s rewarding 
about it? 
P: 
What I think brings people into it, like myself, from not having a nursing, a medical background is that to 
me it’s very similar to parenting and care, being that I had experience as a mother of three, and I felt like, you 
know, I wanted to try to encourage other moms—you can do this, because you know how to take care of 
people. And so, I felt I had the skillset to know how to take care of somebody, to have critical observation skills 
to see what they need, to notice different, you know, are there changes in their behavior that could be related 
to their health. Because I haven’t had a lot of training I’m not as comfortable with some of the daily personal 
care that nurses or CNAs would be, you know, it’s still a new thing for me even though I’m doing it ‘round the 
clock to have those intimate care experiences. But being that I have gone through some limited care, for 
instance, for being in the hospital, having children. I know how I felt in those situations, and so I try to bring a 
lot of dignity and privacy when I deliver care and be cognizant of respecting their dignity [44.50].

I: 
So, you mentioned the training—that you’re uncomfortable with some of the activities because you 
haven’t done them before. Can you talk about the value—what you feel the value of training for personal care 
workers is, and is that something that’s important because a number of personal care workers come to this 
with—they don’t have the background of having been a caregiver or a mother so what are your thoughts on 
that? 
P: 
I think it’s important to be the receiver of care so that as part of any kind of orientation or training to be 
on the receiving end so that you understand what it’s like to have somebody do personal care, peri-care, a 
shower, have someone give you a shower so that you can understand what it’s like when you’re on the 
receiving end. So, I think that can help us be better—provide better care [43.52]. And what I was trying to relay 
is that if you’re a nurse, you’re used to doing this, and you know, it’s not something that a person would stop—
a nurse would necessarily stop and think about—not that there’s callousness in that, but it’s something you’re 
very familiar with. So, what I think I tend to bring as a caregiver, care partner is being very aware that the elder 
deserves dignity and may want their privacy, and how to respect that. So, in terms of just basic training I think 
being the patient, being the receiver is really important, and we’ve tried to do that. You know, we’ve tried to—
we’ve practiced transfers with each other—the caregivers so that we know what it feels like. And that was eye-
opening, and I think that’s an important thing. 
I: 
It’s a good point. 
I2: 
Can we pause here for a second. Sorry. I’m going to restart these things. 
P: 
I’m not a good communicator. [Laughing] that’s the other thing I want to say. 
I: 
You’re doing great. 
P: 
I’m not a great, you know, it’s funny I liked being in enforcement. I negotiated enforcement settlements, 
and because so much of that I could prepare for, but because this is still a new career for me I often feel like 
it’s not something I can just spit out, and I should be able to do that by now. 
I: 
It takes practice, and just doing it over—you know, talking about this over and over and over. I’m not—I 
over prepare for everything, and I’m not really good about thinking right on the spot, you know, responding on 
the spot to questions. That makes me really nervous, but you’re doing fine. And I want to make sure that we 
ask the right questions. If there are things that you feel are important to say, you know, what might they be, 
and how can we get at that in this interview? 
P: 
One advantage I think I feel that I have is that because I’ve been a professional versus, you know, I feel 
for a lot of the caregivers—personal care aides because if they haven’t had that professional experience where 
they—they’re not—I feel very comfortable saying what I need or, you know, when I have worked for somebody 
telling them what my expectations are. That’s something I would—I hope comes out through this process is 
that - a lot of the personal care aides, I’m assuming they don’t always have the confidence or they’re not 
comfortable being more assertive, and so you know - that they’re not taken advantage of, so they are 
respected. 
I: 
Mmm hmm, right. 
I2: 
Ready whenever. 
I: 
Okay. All right. Where we left off was talking a little bit about training, and I’d like to follow that line of 
thought a little bit.  I know you’re concerned about some of the personal care workers that are just starting out 
and maybe haven’t had training or experience as a parent or just being comfortable, you know, establishing 
professional boundaries or being in a professional role? And you know, a lot of that comes with time and 
practice and age, and so—

P: 
Lot of great mentoring [40.15]. 
I: 
And great mentoring, and one of the things we’re working on with another project is making sure that 
the personal care workers—those entering the field and also those who have been in the field for a long time 
have an opportunity for training because even people that have been in the field for a long time, you know, 
they may have been doing transferring, but not necessarily in the safest possible way to protect the client, but 
also to protect themselves. So, I know you were just expressing some thoughts and concerns about personal 
care workers entering the field and making sure that they are treated well, too. You know, we’re concerned 
about dignity for the clients, but then what are the rights of the workers and the way in which they should to be 
treated. So, can you talk a little more about that? 
P: 
Let’s see. [Pause] I have to collect my thoughts there [laughs]. 
I: 
That’s fine. 
I2: 
No worries. 
I: 
Take your time. 
P: 
Part of the training process I think would be beneficial especially if the personal care aides are going 
out and working on their own versus working at a facility, that they be given mentoring to develop an amount of 
self-confidence or assertiveness [38.44] as they deliver care so that they feel empowered to—I don’t know. I’m 
losing my thought. 
I: 
That’s fine. You know, we can come back to that, and we’ll talk about something else, and then— 
P: 
Okay. Thank you. 
I: 
--when it comes back, you know, when you think of things that you want to make sure— 
P: 
Do you understand where I’m coming from that I just see that there’s a real difference in the women I’ve 
worked with. So often they don’t feel like they can say anything to their employer or you know, or even, you 
know, they just don’t have the confidence—not necessarily the confidence to speak up. You know, just like 
doing transfers, you learn how to do a transfer the right way, and then you learn you have to adapt for each 
elder or sometimes the aides are just pushed to do it quickly, and because they have a large workload. So, try 
to find a way to communicate through training that people need to develop a sense of confidence and be able 
to speak up for themselves, but. 
I: 
So, when you were taking care of clients, and you were going into larger institutions to do this you must 
have come across that more frequently where perhaps personal care workers are not—don’t feel comfortable 
speaking up for whatever reason, you know, they need the job or— 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
--they’re worried about retribution. They don’t have the skills. Can you think of a time, you know, 
something memorable, this seems like an important topic for you that you feel strongly about, can you give an 
example—a memorable story or experience when this kind of thing happened? 
P: 
Well, part of the challenge that I’ve observed for caregivers, at large facilities, is that their workload is 
very high, so they don’t have a lot of time to actually spend with each elder [36.34] even though they’d like to. 
So, they are rushing along. They may not get the support. My understanding in talking to a few of the 
caregivers that I’ve watched provide care, their training is extremely minimal because a facility wants to get 
them out working as soon as possible. So, providing training, being able to go to training is something that’s 
usually not available. At Shine House, one of the things I wanted to do because I feel it’s very important is put 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Melinda Shine. Haslett. 2.24.18
5
aside a little bit of funds—some of our budget—is for annual training that each caregiver can receive pay to go 
to a training, and also, we will pay for the training so that they feel like they can continue to expand their 
skillset, and it can be what they choose to do or what they feel they need to focus on. So, being able to be 
trained once you’re initially oriented I think is really important, and then continue to have peer review and 
mentoring, and then. 
I: 
As much for the worker as for the client? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
So that both rights are respected. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
The rights of both are respected. Yeah. 
P: 
Especially with specialized care such as memory care dementia. In talking to caregivers, I think there’s 
very little training available at facilities or just dementia training in general, and so you have caregivers going 
into a memory care facility and really not understanding what dementia or Alzheimer’s is, and how to 
communicate effectively with someone with Alzheimer’s or dementia. 
I: 
What are your goals for Shine house now that you’ve established yourself and you have one client and 
hopefully will get more? Do you have some long-term goals? 
P: 
Well, having our—we have a dementia specialist—a nationally certified dementia specialist that is 
required  under the license; however, they’re not required to give hands-on care, but here at Shine House, our 
specialist will provide care throughout the week [34.06]. So, both—the purpose of that is that she, the 
dementia—okay. So, the purpose of that is both that she can provide really good care to those who need it, but 
also to train our small staff on dementia care, and then so that we can meet regularly and talk about what 
works with each elder, and what doesn’t work. So, really providing dementia specialized care. 
I: 
With regular care meetings with the staff? 
P: 
Yes. And that the dementia specialist is not just an administrative person. She’s providing the care. She 
understands how each elder needs their care delivered, and they can provide that information and work with us 
together and make sure each caregiver’s skills are appropriate for comm—just communicating sometimes with 
an elder with dementia. That can be the challenge. Understanding what their words really mean. If they’re 
ability to communicate is compromised by the dementia. 
I: 
So, one of the reasons we’re doing this project is to give people a chance to say what’s on their mind, 
and tell the world, you know, why this is such an important line of work, and how it should be—what are your 
ideas on how it should be valued more, improved? You know, if Governor Snyder was sitting right here, right 
now, what would you say to him about this line of work, and what you’re doing as a provider—an AFC provider, 
but also what the personal care workers are providing? 
P: 
Perhaps the first thing I would say to Governor Snyder is, providing really good care probably results in 
savings in medical costs because if we can take care of the elder and manage their daily care, their health, 
generally speaking, we’d be able to lessen the amount of emergency trips, and progression of certain health 
issues. If we stay on top of their, if we know their baseline, which is important so that, you know, good care 
can’t really be provided in the ER or in a once a year, you know, annual visit. We can—we want to work with 
the doctor as well because we record what the healthcare—we record the elder’s condition [31.09], and their 
health—level of health, and then we can provide that information and identify, too, any medical provider what 
their needs are or needs to be looked at. So, just being on top of each elder’s health. And secondly, I would 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Melinda Shine. Haslett. 2.24.18
6
say that our society needs to do a better job of respecting our elders and making sure that they can enjoy the 
later phase of life is really important. That’s where good care comes in, making sure that the person has their 
mental, emotional, physical needs met—spiritual needs met, and that’s what can happen at a good care home. 
And thirdly, our population—our elder population is growing and growing, and it’s something we need to be 
looking at very seriously now, and not putting it off to look at in the—it’s something we can’t put off because the 
care crisis is now. 
I2: 
You’re so well spoken and thank you so much [laughing] for your answers. I wanted to tease out one 
thing. I mean there’s so many questions, but there’s one thing that’s really interesting. You said that as a 
society we have to value this care a lot more. In your experience what has been the most effective way of 
making a lay person understand the value of elder care? Like what’s been an effective method in making that 
an important thing? 
P: 
[Pause] well, the first thing that comes to mind working at Crosairs and meeting the elders there, the 
majority of them were not just in their 80s they were in their 90s, and generally speaking the elders came to 
Crosairs and their health actually improved after moving to Crosairs and getting really good care. 
I2: 
Sure. 
P: 
And so, that’s what I was able to observe, and that’s the message that—we had one elder that was 
probably 93/94 when she arrived. She was on oxygen. She was in a walker. Could not provide—do any of her 
care. She was, you know, most of her energy was spent just trying to breathe, and with that personal care she 
was the most vibrant, active elder at our home [28.20]. So, just taking care of somebody, meeting their needs 
on a daily basis can result in great improvement in health. 
I2: 
Before we started talking, you were talking about how—you were talking about marketing. You were 
talking about how you sometimes felt uncomfortable talking about things that you’re doing here. I think that this 
kind of care needs it’s own version of marketing almost because what you just described and the difference in 
a person’s quality of life based on care, and the outcome of that kind of care is so huge, but a lot of people 
don’t know that difference.  
P: 
And unfortunately, it does come down to cost because basic care is very expensive, so if you want a 3 
to 1 ratio, which is—or a lower ratio is necessary, generally, to provide good care—it’s even more expensive. 
So, I think that would be another thing to add to Governor Snyder’s list is we really need to get the message 
out that people need to save for this, and if people don’t have their own way to pay for it, and that we have to 
look at it as paying for good care for elders, that it is a right. 
I2: 
Mmm hmm. 
P: 
So, I got on a tangent and there was something else I wanted to say. You know, you made a good 
point, [26.44] marketing should be as simple as just telling people what we can do, but I view it as more—to me 
the challenge is it feels like self-promotion, and that to me, that’s my biggest challenge —I can talk to people if I 
prepare about something. You know, I can talk about environmental standards, but— 
I: 
So, just remember— 
P: 
--and it’s the cost too. I have a hard time knowing that most people cannot afford the care. 
I: 
So, promoting—we’re talking about this feels like self-promotion, but putting the Shine House aside just 
for a minute and let’s say you were promoting the profession itself, the personal care worker profession, that 
wouldn’t qualify as self-promotion. So, maybe you could talk about it from sort of the greater society context, 
too. K’s question is, you know, how do we get the message out there that we need to value our elders more, 
and we need to value the people who are caring for them more. Whether it’s Shine House or any place, and 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Melinda Shine. Haslett. 2.24.18
7
that it’s because, if for no other reason, for cost savings. And we also need to encourage people to save for 
this, but then beyond that there’s, you know respect for people. So, how do we get that message out? We’ve 
been trying to get that message out for years, and don’t seem to be making much headway. 
P: 
Yeah. So, it’s very similar in my mind to how—we generally don’t value childcare workers as well. You 
know, starting the most important times in providing care or support probably is at the beginning of life and at 
the end of life. So, I don’t know how to answer that. 
I: 
It’s a tough message. 
P: 
And again, for me [24.35] it’s—it’s not something that’s just engrained in me in terms of—I look at most 
things as an—a regulatory standpoint, you know. That’s what really struck me as I went into different facilities 
that—well, if I was here doing an inspection, you know, there’s this and there’s all these things aren’t where 
they should be, and that’s been quite an adjustment realizing that the—this is a tangent, but the way the 
inspectors for AFC licenses—they look at things very differently. 
I: 
That skillset, that background might actually work in your favor in a lot of ways. 
P: 
Well, as an owner, yes, but I mean one of the things I initially thought I wanted to do was maybe work 
at the licensing level, and bring my skillset of investigation and case building, but the requirement for an 
inspector license consultant is a Master of Social Work. There is no requirement to have any personal care 
experience, so I think that is something that in the process could be changed to provide better care also 
because if the licensing consultants actually knew how long it took to do a transfer or provide daily care, 
maybe—as well as the lawmakers, because the state standards are too lenient. Any facility would need to 
provide good care—it just would be impossible to do, I believe, at the level of one caregiver per 15 elders. 
I: 
So, you keep coming back to the same concepts of it’s the staffing ratio. 
P: 
The staffing ratio. 
I: 
And the training that’s provided— 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
--for the personal care workers. If there were improvements in both of those, you could be giving a lot 
better care for people. 
P: 
Yes. And if the caregivers had more training maybe they would have more sense of pride because 
there is great turnover in the field, and so that is not—that interferes with providing good care in my opinion. 
Elders need to have consistency, and if [21.59] the workforce of the caregivers are changing constantly, which 
is what I have noticed when I’ve been at facilities, it is difficult to provide good consistent care if the elders 
aren’t able to work with the same caregivers on a monthly basis. Especially for memory care. It’s confusing for 
an elder to have someone walk in to their room to provide medicine that they’ve never met before. You know, 
and that person may be gone in a month or two, and so they start over with a new person. 
I: 
So, the continuity of care is really important? 
P: 
Continuity of care, yes. 
I: 
Establishing relationships. I have a couple more questions, but I was going to ask K how we’re doing on 
time, and if you have other questions? 
I2: 
We are good. Maybe I can pause here. This is a good place to pause.

P: 
So, I think there’s certain messages that probably are better delivered by other [laughing] people 
because I’m not succinct. 
I2: 
I think you’re doing great, but I want—it’s just like two friends talking, and the answers don’t have to be 
right, and it’s like someone meeting—you meeting someone at a coffee shop, and they’re like, “Hey, what do 
you do?” And they’re like, “Oh, elder care. I didn’t realize that was a thing.” Like, “Ah, I just never thought about 
that. Tell me more. Tell me some stories.” So that would be great because I’d like, like a 60-minutes interview 
where, you know, you’re recording the whole thing, and most of it’s like gonna go online. This is—we’re using 
parts of this, and it’s really beneficial if we can get rich stories to kind of humanize this—your profession, and to 
also humanize like the geriatric population. So, the way to do that is to be very relatable [19.55], and be like, 
oh, wow. I can’t imagine what that would be like if I was in that position or if I was caring for someone, or if I 
was being cared for. I don’t know if that’s helpful, but that is, yeah. There’s no wrong thing here. 
P: 
So, probably what I could speak to better than—is like dementia care. I really feel that what I’ve seen is 
many caregivers have had no dementia training. 
P: 
Well, I was just going to say, so that’s probably—where I can offer a few observations. Again, I still feel 
like I’m a newbie in that. 
I: 
You might be a newbie to ownership or even—but you’re not a newbie to providing care. I mean you 
did it for your great uncle when you were young. 
P: 
I didn’t do extensive personal care, you know what I mean? To me the challenge is always the bathing 
and everything. I’m still not really, you know, that’s not secondhand to me. 
I: 
Right. But you know a lot about it—about this profession. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You know a lot even if you feel like you haven’t had personal experience providing the care, the actual 
care. You, obviously, have a passion for it, and a calling almost to do this. So much so that you’ve established 
this house, and you take it so seriously, and you have this really wonderful underlying philosophy, so you know 
you have, you know, a lot more experience and knowledge than most people. I mean most people have their 
head buried in the sand. They’re not even thinking they’re ever going to grow old let alone need help. So, I 
appreciate you— 
I: 
I appreciate you framing it a little differently. We should do it that way [17.58] from the beginning. Yes, 
instead. So, I agree with K that this is, you know, we’ll just use pieces of this. We’re not gonna use the whole 
thing, and it should be just real, like, we’re at a coffee shop, and I’ve just asked you to tell me, you know, what 
do you do? Do you work outside of the home? Do you have, you know, what’s your background? What do you 
like to do? 
I2: 
And I know socially these pieces of equipment make it feel different, you know, but if you could just use 
a moment to just kind of disconnect from all this. This is just us hanging out. 
P: 
This isn’t so much the challenge for me, it’s with my, you know, I’m having my own stresses and 
memory issues. I don’t feel like I’m, you know, I don’t feel like I could conduct an environmental negotiation 
anymore because I [laughing] I’m tired, number 1— 
I2: 
Yeah. 
P: 
--most of the time because I am here all the time, so I don’t’ feel like I’m as articulate as I used to be, 
but I would like—I feel like where I’m more passionate is about dementia care. Although I still have so much to 
learn [16.54]. I feel like that’s really where there’s a real deficiency in both the knowledge and training of the

caregivers including myself, but I’m working on it. And what people receive, and just so I can talk about Ma, 
you know, indirectly about her experience, and how this is the right setting for her. Not for everybody, but for 
her we’ve finally—she’s in a space where she’s comfortable. Everything pretty much stays the same other than 
moving the furniture around. You know, she has real consistency because there’s three of us taking care of 
her, and we’re here every day. And some days she remembers our name and some days she doesn’t, so. And 
as I was talking about dementia care I realized that, you know, I don’t know if the public realizes that 
Alzheimer’s is a subset of dementia. But anyone in the dementia umbrella has generally cognitive or memory 
impairments to deal with, so as many things as possible need to be kept consistent to help them just get 
through the day [15.31]. 
I: 
You mentioned Ma, can you tell a story about her? She’s a great example and her husband too, and 
what a difference this had made in their lives. 
P: 
I’ve known my client since 2013, and I followed her through four different facilities. We started out with 
assisted living and went to memory care at the same facility, and then she moved to two other facilities. And 
each facility there was a change of ownership, which I think is somewhat becoming common in the care field 
that large facilities are going from maybe a small business ownership to a corporate ownership. But at the 
large facilities my client was at, the caregiver staff was generally not consistent. So, she was being introduced 
to new people all the time, and medication was a real challenge that if she didn’t know the person well or 
maybe the way the caregiver presented the medication, she would not take it. And without her medication 
being consistently delivered, she wasn’t getting the benefit of good pain management. Her anxiety was higher, 
and so right now I think what we’ve been able to accomplish—we have a real—we have a schedule, but it, you 
know, we’re flexible, but we do have a schedule. We’ve gotten to the point where we can say this your 
medication [13.49]. You know, we’re not trying to always slip it in. You know, we’re able to say this is your 
medication. This is why you need to take it, and there’s a level of trust established, and we’re, you know, 
probably 98% able to deliver that medication, and that helps her body be more consistent. She’s getting 
consistent pain management. Also, we’re able to rotate or reposition her every 2 hours, which is a standard for 
someone is who is not mobile, and that’s very important for managing her pain and enhancing her circulation. 
So, now I think she is more comfortable because we have the time to deliver that care that’s needed. And 
throughout the night she needs to be repositioned every 2 hours, and so mostly it’s myself going in and saying, 
Ma, it’s M, and this is what I need to do. And so, there’s more of a recognition of, okay, I know who you are 
versus—it would be very stressful to be on the receiving end of care when you don’t feel like you know that 
individual providing care. I don’t think people realize that that’s an issue in care that others may not even really 
know—the caregivers—because they change. They tend to change, and so. 
I: 
So, again, the importance of that relationship. 
P: 
Yes. It is a relationship— 
I: 
And trust. 
P: 
--and it’s a partnership, and the only way to deliver good care is there has to be that trust, and 
sometimes there’s certain caregivers—it’s like any other relationship. Some matches work better, and we have 
been with—with the three caregivers here at Shine House right now, some of us—we all have our strengths. I 
can work with her doing crafts and reading and things. Whereas A has the best communication to really go 
through and figure out what’s bothering her. So, we all have different levels of success and also intimacy. I 
think that she’s more willing to provide information maybe to her best friend, you know, her caregiver, A. And 
then, in turn, A can teach us what works better or suggest that we try something different [11.09]. So, we’re a 
small team, and I think that that’s very important.

I: 
So, going with the coffee shop idea, what do you say to people who say, “Wow. I am so glad you are 
doing this kind of work [laughing] because I could never do that. I just can’t imagine doing that,” and you know, 
“You don’t live here do you? I mean how do you do this? You must really be committed.” 
P: 
Well, I’m hoping that, you know, we will—the business model is based on three elders, so it is difficult 
right now, but I’m getting a lot of experience. You know, I know what it’s like now to provide care, you know, 
every 2 hours, and what it’s like to be tired, so I think that makes me a better business owner. I always knew 
that I would do a lot of the night shifts because to me that’s the hard—for me it’s the hardest shift. So, to know 
what is reasonable for me to accept/expect out of caregivers/care partners. I don’t want the care partners to 
have to work all night. I worked at a facility where we worked all night long, and sometimes it was difficult to 
provide care because you had so many tasks to do. So, here at Shine House I want this to be a resting 
position where you’re just, if you’re here overnight, it is just to attend to the caregivers, and then rest yourself 
so that you can be as sharp as you can be [9.37]. It is demanding. It is hard on the body, but some, you know, 
also finding the right person, somebody who wants to work at night, and finding a caregiver that’s doing what 
they want to do when they want to do it is the way we’ve, fortunately, been able to work it out. Each person’s 
been able to pick their shift, and we’ve made it work. The most difficult part about care, which again, because I 
didn’t come from a care background, is the realization that it is a 24-7. So, holidays are something that you 
may not be able to be at home on holidays. You may have to be providing care, so in orienting or talking to 
people about possible careers, that’s really something to think about, and I guess generally when people go 
into medicine that’s on their mind, but that was a new consideration for me. Sorry, that was another [laughing] 
tangent. 
I: 
No. That was great. 
I2: 
That was very natural. [Inaudible] 
I: 
So, any, from both of you, any final thoughts, things you feel are really important to say about this 
work? 
P: 
I’m just not a good spokesperson. You know, I think spending your time with A, she’s so much more 
succinct and just has so many great stories to tell. 
I2: 
I think it’s amazing what you’ve already said and thank you so much. There’s one thing I wanted to ask, 
and in addition to creating an understanding or sharing an understanding of the need for better elder care and 
more attention to elder care, you just touched on talking to the people who are looking at this as a career. Can 
you talk a little bit more about that, and maybe the other side of things because whenever you look at any 
career thing about what’s difficult about it and what’s rewarding about it, and that balances things - lets you—
helps you choose the path. So, can you talk about the other aspect of it. Granted it’s a 24-7 type of job like 
medicine, but can you talk about some of the rewards and some of the other aspects of it as a career? 
P: 
There’s probably other people that could do that better, and the reason why I say that—just going to the 
IMPART meeting - it was interesting for me to listen to one of the care business owners saying, “how can we 
go out and talk to young people about getting into this career when they’ll start at $9 or $10, and they’ll finish 
by making $10”, and so I don’t know how—I don’t know how to address that. That was something that really 
made me think, wow. And for me it was different because I already had a career, and I just wanted to pick up 
some hours, and I could help somebody, but that is the challenge [6.20]. My husband and I talked about it, and 
I said I want to do something more giving, and you know, as my partner, he’s financed a lot of this. So, I’m 
fortunate that, you know, I do need to start making an income. That’s been a hard part. I haven’t been able to 
pay myself. My first priority has been to keep the good people that I have working with me to keep working 
here. I think it’d be great if somebody else could address that because I don’t know how to speak to that other 
than saying that I think that’s—and maybe it’s a great second career, too, for somebody who’s at a stage of life

where they want to do more care because this is so far from where—I never considered myself as a people 
person. I mean I was a good enforcement person because I could be really direct and really demanding in 
terms of very analytical, so this is more of a stretch for me. 
I: 
You mentioned IMPART and I think you’ve actually done a whole lot better than you are letting on 
because this is the kind of conversation that we’re trying—through IMPART- to take to a higher level, more of a 
societal level. Exactly the kinds of things you’re experiencing right now we need to work on collectively at a 
higher level with legislators and policy makers and, you know, how can we make change? I think the way to do 
it is to do exactly what we’re doing with IMPART, and that’s to form this coalition, these collective efforts and 
mobilize and really explore different ways of getting these messages out there so that they do make an impact 
on policymakers. So, I think everything you’re saying is spot on, and we just need to do it at, you know, a level 
like with IMPART where we’re sort of bringing that message to a much wider audience. 
P: 
So, my goal is to—in the future have more of a network where I can talk to other AFC, small group 
home owners and learn from them, but, also, I’d like to be able to encourage more people, especially women, 
that, you know, you can start your own home. And maybe this is something that—it can take you from being a 
care worker, a personal care worker to maybe being able to increase your income and giving them the 
confidence that they can do that. And that’s the interesting thing about IMPART is that I see, you know, there’s 
the people who work for aging agencies, and they’re articulate, and they’re confident to just—they’re used to 
being—comfortable speaking out in a group like that. And then I see the women that are providing care, and I 
just know that they have such a different background, and so they don’t have—they just don’t feel as 
comfortable sharing, and I know you’re good at bringing that out, but again, I just—to me that’s so important - 
is it’s the workers being highlighted, like the amount of wisdom that A has versus— 
I: 
I couldn’t agree more. I think this is rare. I mean it’s hard to believe, but the IMPART experience is 
really rare to have— 
P: 
Mmm hmm, at the table— 
I: 
--agency owners and the PCAs at the same table, and for a lot of reasons we’ve already talked about, I 
think that the women, the PCAs that are there are a little bit intimidated too. 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
And we have to recognize that, and so much of what we’ve been doing over the last year is more about 
relationship building and learning each other’s languages and trying to build trust so that everybody feels 
comfortable talking because we need their voice. We really do. 
P: 
And changing the industry, also, you know, I was fortunate to work for T who’s very charismatic and 
very committed and passionate, but a lot of the caregivers are working for a corporation now, and they don’t 
have a voice. So that is part of the challenge in the direction of care. 
I: 
So, just so you know one of our big goals is to build this coalition, which would be a great vehicle for 
information exchange. You mentioned wanting to be able to communicate with other AFCs, and other people in 
the field, and exchange ideas, and all of that, so that’s one of the biggest goals of the coalition. 
P: 
So, and outside of—I have Mal—I have my association, but it—I still don’t—because I’m coming from, 
you know, T’s orientation of we want to change it. The care workers aren’t the problem, in my opinion. You 
know, it’s— 
I: 
What is the problem? Who is the problem?

P: 
Being able to provide the care the way it should be done on a small scale. So, I’d like to be part of a 
small group home— 
I: 
Sure. 
P: 
--organization of both the owners and the caregivers because right now I pay a membership fee, but to 
have A—I don’t have the money to pay for A to be a member of that as well. 
I: 
Right. 
P: 
But so that would be interesting to see an association where both are able to join. Maybe the caregivers 
can become part of that at a much-reduced cost, but it’s that exchange. Not just the owners. I want to—so, 
anyway. 
I: 
No. That’s a great idea, and I’m going to—I’ll do something with it, and maybe you could help develop 
that idea. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
See where we can go with this. So, thank you so much. 
P: 
Well, thanks for making this comfortable [laughs]. 
I: 
Now, you get to have a photo shoot now. 
P: 
Uh-oh. 
I: 
[group laughter] and I— 
I2: 
Both of you stay right there for a second.
