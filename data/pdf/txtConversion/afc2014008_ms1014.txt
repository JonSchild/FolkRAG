As many of you may already know,  Bess Hawes will soon retire
 
after 15 years as head of the Folk Arts Program.
 Her commitment
 
and passion for the traditional arts have been evident from her
 
first days here,  and she has served the agency and the field with
 
distinction.
 She leaves in place a vital support network,
 
particularly with the state arts agency folk art apprenticeships,
 
and the highly respected and much cherished National Heritage
 
Awards.
 Traditional artists all over America are in her debt.
 
In addition to her professional success,  she has earned the
 
admiration and affection of her colleagues in the field,  and I
 
know that her friends are many here.
 Bess has been a steadfast
 
presence around this place for 15 years,  and her dedication to
 
the traditional arts she loves symbolizes the spirit that moves
 
us all in our service to the public and the arts.
 We will miss
 
her,  and I know that all of you will want to wish her a fond
 
farewell.
 
I am appointing Dan Sheehy,  long-time assistant director,  to the
 
position of Director of the Folk Arts Program.
 Dan has been with
 
the Endowment since 1978,  and he has served as Assistant Director
 
of the Folk Arts Program for the past 10 years.
 Before coming
 
here,  he worked with the Smithsonian Institution,  and over the
 
years,  he has  remained active both as a performer and as
 
presenter at the annual Festival of American Folklife.
 He brings
 
to the position a background as a musician,  teacher,  and training
 
as an ethnomusicologist.
 With his understanding and appreciation
 
of the traditional arts and his wide range of experience,  Dan is
 
the logical choice for the position,  and I know that you will
 
want to pass along your congratulations to him.
 I am always
 
pleased when I am able to select someone who has  risen through
 
the ranks as Director for a program.
 
Bess approves,  too.

Dear Ms.  Hawes:
 
I am delighted to extend heartfelt
 
congratulations on your retirement.
 
In the 15 years that you have developed
 
the Folk Arts Program at the Arts Endowment,
 
you have helped to encourage and to preserve
 
the traditional arts of our country.
 All
 
Americans are indebted to you for your work,
 
and you can be proud of leaving behind a
 
strong and vital support system for the
 
folk arts in our Nation.
 
Barbara and I send best wishes for every
 
future happiness and success.

Dear Bess,
 
In the course of my wanderings,  I
 
have come to believe that there is
 
such a thing as a conspiracy of good
 
people who, without even knowing
 
one another,  make the world finer
 
and life upon the earth more humane.
 
And you are capo,  Bess,  sachem,
 
pharaoh,  secretary-general,  Mother
 
Superior of this wide-ranging
 
brother and sisterhood.
 I admire
 
you for what you have done and for
 
who you are,  and send love.
 
As ever,

Dear Bess,
 
There is no one who has made a greater contribution at the
 
Arts Endowment than you,  Bess.
 Your shepherding of the Folk Arts
 
Program led to some of the most wonderful and enduring projects
 
in the arts to benefit from Federal funding.
 The heritage is the
 
better,  and the living tradition carries on,  in no small measure
 
to your tireless efforts.
 
You invented the Heritage Awards.
 This allowed so many fine
 
artists to come to public attention,  and gave incentive to those
 
who would carry these arts forward.
 On a personal note,  I still
 
keep on my desk the picture of that wonderful Hmong flutist.
 I
 
keep it there to remind me of the peril of his journey and the
 
strength that immigrants like him bring -
-
 both to our country
 
and to our culture.
 
I will also never forget,  Bess,  our trip to Hawaii, American
 
Samoa,  Guam and the Northern Marianas.
 It was a privilege to be
 
in your company.
 It was to be in the company of a genuine
  
leader,  for the keepers and practitioners of so many traditions.
 
As you leave the Endowment,  Bess -
-
 I wish you wouldn't -
-
you can take great pride in the lasting contributions you have
 
made.
 In their own way,  these contributions are as strong and
 
enduring as those of your more famous brother and father.
 You
 
have helped preserve America's memory of herself and make it more
 
a part of our everyday lives,  although it should surely be more
 
SO.
 You have done so without fanfare and with humility.
 
you.
 
Thank you,  Bess.
 I was lucky to have been associated with
 
With warmest wishes for the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
Frank Hodsoll

At this important moment, I want to tell you what I
 
have told many people in the past: You handled your
 
difficult responsibilities at the Endowment with
 
intelligence and wit, with grace and dignity. I
 
deeply enjoyed our contacts at the Council table and
 
away from it  I miss you, and shall continue to do
 
so.

It is awkward to commit to paper those things I have learned from Bess
 
over the years; we have known each other for so long and through so many
 
changing circumstances that I don't know where to start.  The insights and
 
wisdom that she shares are the subtle kind that fit naturally, and
 
integrate with what you are doing, so that they seem like your own
 
thoughts.
 It is later, when you look back and realize that you weren't
 
headed in that direction at all, that you remember that Bess said
 
something, or conveyed an attitude, which put a different spin on whatever
 
you were engaged in.
 In the end, you don't have a list of six sure fire
 
tips for rubbing shoulders with the traditional arts, but some of her
 
mission, and her sense of respect and wonderment for humankind's expressive
 
arts, has rubbed off on you and become your own.
 
In 1975, when the California Heartland program was being researched and
 
worked up for the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, I remember feeling that a
 
worthy traditional folk or ethnic performer must be pretty exotic.  Bess
 
told about all the ordinary looking people in ordinary living rooms that
 
were visited in the course of the fieldwork who turned out to be
 
extraordinary musicians or craftspeople at the same time.  You had to ask
 
them, show a genuine interest, and then their gifts would be shared.  But
 
this was much more than a technique for successful fieldwork.
 It was an
 
appreciation for the delicate balances between public and private self,
 
between being American and also ethnic, and between making a living and
 
practicing a soul-sustaining art, that are a big part of what makes our
 
country work.
 
In the end, it is not specific information, or even brilliant analysis
 
that matters.
 It is a willingness to listen and observe, enthusiasm for
 
people, respect for excellence, and integrity in dealing with people that
 
gets you through the rough spots and makes life interesting.  The practice
 
of folklore is a conversation about life, one that goes on endlessly
 
because there are no final answers.  While it is disquieting to think of
 
Bess retiring from the NEA, I expect the conversation to go on.

Dear  Bess,
 
I remember very well  that when you defected to the NEA I thought
 
it a terrible waste.  Your  teaching and research were so valuable
 
and uniquely  informed.  I never met anyone as sensitive to
 
students and their  needs.
 
But  I was wrong.  What you have done  in your  tenure as director  of
 
the Folk Arts program  is to educate the nation.  You have
 
established the necessary criteria for evaluating the great
 
heritage of our  folk  tradition and expanded the country's
 
awareness of  its rich,  many-sided heritage.  What was once the
 
l
imited province of a small  band of devoted but often myopic
 
folklorists has become the world-wide comprehension that  the
 
United States has a rich and variegated folk  legacy which  is
 
alive and of critical  importance for achieving the goals of our
 
democratic commitments
 No one else could have accomplished that
 
and remained the  lovable person you are.
 
I'm delighted to know that you'll  have time to pick up your
 
former  interests and give us the benefit of your  insights and
 
instruction.  But even  if you decide to simply relax and catch up
 
with purely personal  activities,  you have  left a brilliant and
 
exemplary history which I know wil l continue along the  l
ines you
 
have established.
 
Mazl  tuhv!  All  best wishes  for many more healthy and happy years.
 
Much  love from all  of our  family.

Dear Bess,
 
Fifteen years ago,  when I was departing Washington to go and establish
 
a state folklore program back home in Alabama,  you wrote a remarkable five-page
 
epistle suggesting some of the things a young public  folklorist should keep in
 
mind.
 
Among that letter's highlights were:
 
"Really,  way down at the bottom,  for the
 
big important part,  folklore is about
 
protest."
 
"I know that all God's  chillun  got  folklore,  but
 
the president of General Motors doesn't have to
 
bother to write a song to explain how he feels
 
about something;  he has a public relations division
 
do that  for him."
 
"The most and the best of folkloric expression
 
remains in the minds and the hands of the have-nots."
 
"Don't be scared to decide who's best and who's not."
 
"The push toward electronic  instruments  is antithetical
 
to our democratic system."
 
"American people are fundamentally and essentially
 
egalitarian."
 
And finally...
 
"Your job is  just  to move quietly and deliberately and
 
confidently about your business of letting the folks--
all of them--have their say,  in the best circumstances
 
possible.
 And God or culture or history or the unified
 
field theory or something will take care of the rest."
 
-2-
Bess,  your words and thoughts,  but,  more than  that,  your energy and real
 
sense of caring,  have continued to influence me profoundly over the last decade
 
and a half.
 I observed and admired as you skillfully worked to construct a
 
national network of public support of folk culture,  and I listened and learned
 
from your thoughtful advice on when to act quietly,  when to cause a ruckus,  when
 
to be the bureaucrat,  when to he the guerilla.
 
And as a sister of the South,  you have confirmed that notion bestowed upon
 
me by my region--that when best-laid plans and carefully calculated strategies
 
fail us,  person-to-person relationships,  folks talking sincerely and honestly
 
one to another,  can sometimes allow us to move mountains.
 
The Endowment  is certainly going to miss you,  Bess -
-
 miss your steady hand,
 
your careful reasoning,  your passion and your constant caring.
 There's all too
 
little passion and caring in Washington.
 But,  I look forward to seeing more of you
 
in Alabama,  to our continuing dialogue,  to your continuing advice.
 
And,  we all look forward to your continuing the  "business of letting the folks--
all of them--have their say" knowing that you'll never resign yourself to letting
 
"God or culture or history or the unified field theory or something.
.
. take care
 
of the rest."
 
All best,

Dear Bess:
 
For years,  you have shared yourself generously with your fellow
 
citizens--especially your fellow folklorists--in the genres of
 
fellowship,  scholarship,  song,  public service,  counselling,
 
encouragement,  and warm friendship.  It is no exaggeration to
 
say that the culture of America,  and our awareness of it as a
 
general  force in our lives,  as well as the cultures of America
 
as expressions of our rich heritages,  have been indelibly touched
 
by your hand and spirit.  You may measure your impact in part by
 
the tremendous range of people,  cultures,  and vernacular arts that
 
have been nourished by your work in the Folk Arts Program of the
 
National Endowment for the Arts;  you may measure it in part by
 
your strong and shaping role in the development of the Heritage
 
Awards,  which have brought pride and recognition to arts and
 
artists who might have remained invisible;  but I measure it by
 
the abiding,  powerful ethical  influence you have had on all our
 
lives--by the feeling that we are all  (not  just the NEA or the
 
grant recipients)  the beneficiaries of your commitment to and love
 
of American folk cultures.  In this regard,  we have all been the
 
lucky recipients of the Bess Lomax Hawes Fellowship.
 
I count  it one of the highest privileges of my professional and per-
sonal  life that I have had the opportunity to work with you.  Now
 
I wish you some well-earned vacation time.  Stay well.
 
Witb great affection and admiration,

Dear Bess:
 
In my twenty years in the public sector arts business
 
I don't
 know of anyone who has had a greater impact on this
 
country's
 cultural landscape than you.
 You have moved the
 
cause of folk arts  forward through the best and worst of
 
times and have masterfully orchestrated support for folk
 
artists and folk culture in every region of America.
 The
 
admiration felt for you bridges a spectrum of personalities.
 
From a Dewey President William to a Congressman Sydney Yates
 
your name is held in the highest regard.
 
I have personally and professionally learned much from
 
your quiet counsel,  sensitive way with people,  and forthright
 
style of persuasion.
 Your leadership in government has been
 
unique and a model  for us all.
 The numerous examples of
 
support,  guidance and most of all  friendship you have extended
 
to me over the Florida,  Louisiana and Alabama years are pleasant
 
memories of a valued friendship.
 
Your fifteen years at the Endowment have been nothing
 
short of remarkable.  In the interest of folk arts you have
 
stayed the course,  weathered the storms and moved a cumbersome
 
ship forward in a positive and proper direction.
 The success
 
you have achieved in dealing with the cone-head bureaucrats
 
while at the same time maintaining a warm un-government like
 
approach to your extended family in the field has been an
 
amazing accomplishment.
 You have given a different texture
 
and meaning to the term government support.
 As they say
 
in Alabama you are a "fresh green breeze."
 Those who care
 
about folk arts are thankful  for the legacy you leave behind.

As you depart from your position at the Endowment please
 
know you will be missed but never forgotten.
 You can now
 
move to a slightly different sphere of involvement that I
 
know will be welcome and rewarding.
 We are still counting
 
on continued visits to Alabama and good doses of advice when
 
needed.
 
Above all be assured you have made a difference with
 
individuals like me and with states throughout the country.
 
I am a better and wiser person from having been in your company.
 
My fondest wishes will always be with you.

Dear Fess
 
You have just a bit  in com:
n with
 perate
 
little man,  John Hardy -
 you' ve:
 
"been the East,  been tn
 ie West,
 
Been this wide world  'round;
 
Been to the river,  and been baptized
..
 
and now you  can finally get unwound!
 
I wish you a heap of wonderful adventures in the years
 
ahead.
 Your career of devotion has allowed so many great
 
artists to accomplish more and to spend their lives
 
gratified by warm recognition and approval.
 You must hay-
many thousands of friends and admirers.
 It couldn't be any
 
other way.
 You' ve proven that an artful,  gracious spirit
 
can survive in a darkly bureaucratic environment.
 (I know
 
you' ve been tough,  and straight as a pistol-shot,  but T ue
 
never met another highly-place(3 administrator with such
 
capacity for kindness.)
 
You can't know how motivated I have been by your
 
encouragement,  Bess.
 Nothing ever made me prouder  than
 
good words you've had for the Hicks family,  and the
 
Tennessee parks projects.
' 
Your impeccable dedication ban
 
put us all  "under conviction," and has made us bette:
 
You deserve the most potent hospitality that
 
can surrender and much,  much more.
 Thank you fo
 
everything.
 I hope we'll cross paths again soon

My Dear Bass,
 
Seeing as your cohorts are pulling together a
 
celebratory scrapbook of memorabilia for you,  I do have a
 
few reniemberances to add.
 
My first memory of you i
s enduring and touched with a bit of
 
awe and envy.  It was twenty-two years ago.  I was a very
 
young and uncertain first-year graduate student in the
 
Folklore Department at U
.C. Berkeley,  etil trying to figure
 
out who this  '
folk' was whose "
lore" we were supposed to be
 
studying. And you were you, but also--incongruously--a
 
fellow first-year graduate student.  It was like being in
 
boot-Scamp with a veteran green beret in your platoon. For a
 
number of us in that Berkeley squad, you were already the
 
model of what we wanted to become.  I remember especially you
 
showing us and discussing the making of "Pizza Pizza, Daddy-
0
." I remember feeling impressed,  overwhelmed,  and depressed
 
by what I didn't know and couldn't do.
 
The other remembrance I
'd l
ike to share is from many years
 
later,  here in Samoa. We are seated in a fale tele in
 
Vajiojtaj, a rainy Sunday afternoon,  a heavy sea breaking on
 
the black lava cliffs,  It i
s a feast in your honor,  and you
 
are seated cross-legged on a mat with the other dignitaries
 
at the head of the high-domed open house. After the speeches
 
and  ava and gifts, we eat. A plaited coconut frond tray
 
with a banana leaf dish heaped with lobster and tare and pig
 
and pa1u
anii and breadfruit and ohiok n and raw fish i
 
placed on the mat before you. As you now know, guests are
 
not expected to clean their plate; but I watched with
 
pleasure from the far end of the Lale as with gusto you did
 
that plate proud.  I don 't know if you noticed, but the
 
chiefs around you were extremely pleased with the honor you
 
showed them by eating so well of their humble and unfamiliar
 
offerings. Here was a chief worthy of their reciprocal
 
respect.
 
Bess,  I would not be doing what I am doing today, what I
 
love to do, without you. Oh,  I would probably be here in
 
Samoa anyway, doing some half-assed folklore thing on the
 
side. But thanks to you I have been able to devote the past
 
four years to trying to understand the l
ore, now that I have
 
finally managed to partially grasp who the  '
folk'  are here
 
on this volcanic mountaintop surrounded by sea. And there
 
are many more of us lowly folklore field workers out here
 
who can say the same thing--thank you for giving us the
 
chance,  the support,  the direction,  and the inspiration,

I celebrate your liberation from the center, Come back to
 
the field.  I lock forward to seeing you back here in Samoa
 
soon,  We'll have another feast  then talk about what the
 
children are singing as they play , 
Halo lava  lou penina Bess. Fa afetai,  fa'afetai lava,

Dear Bess,
 
My warmest  congratulations on your retirement!
 It seems hard to
 
believe that some twelve years have passed since Heather,  Chris
 
and I drove into Washington in the midst of the summer's heat  so
 
that  I could begin working for you at the Endowment,  and even
 
harder to believe that almost seven years have passed since we
 
departed in the dead of winter to return to family,  friends and
 
new careers here in our native Wisconsin!
 Despite the climatic
 
circumstances that accompanied them,  those two trips have come to
 
seem increasingly significant as time has passed,  and you are the
 
person I have to thank for both!
 
My five years with the Folk Arts Program were among the most
 
exciting I have had as a folklorist.
 It was a privilege to be
 
part of the program during a time when the State Folk Arts
 
Coordinator program was expanding rapidly,  the state
 
apprenticeship programs were being developed,  and the National
 
Heritage Fellowships were first being presented.
 All of these
 
programs were,  of course,  your  ideas,  and the significant
 
functions they still fulfill are testimony to all you have
 
contributed to what has been the most productive of the  federal
 
government's efforts in the area of folk culture.
 
While there are many others better qualified than I to chronicle
 
your accomplishments at the Endowment,  I want to add a brief note
 
about what your example and the experience with Folk Arts have
 
meant to me.
 My five years at the Endowment under your
 
supervision have proven invaluable training for both positions  I
 
have held since.
 Not only did those years thoroughly acquaint me
 
with the granting process,  they also provided me with a wealth of
 
ideas,  projects and programs which I could not possibly exhaust
 
during a lifetime in the discipline!
 
Not long after  I came to the Endowment,  I remember having lunch
 
with you in the cafeteria at  Columbia Plaza.
 During lunch you
 
told me a little anecdote,  taken from your sister Shirley I
 
recall,  which best described your approach to the work of the Folk
 
Arts  Program.
 You said that all we could do was try a variety of
 
different things and hope that  some worked.
 What we were doing
 
was similar to casting rose petals down a well and hoping that

 I
'm sure Shirley's account was more elequent
 
and that my recollection of the exemplar has  faded with the years
 
but rest assured,  Bess,  a lot of the petals have stuck and their
 
imprint will be there for years!

Alas, I hear you are retiring!  What a loss for the Endowment, and for
 
the folk artists of this Nation.
 
On a personal level, you helped shape my experience at the Endowment
 
more than you may realize.
 In the very first weeks of my wide-eyed
 
arrival at that wonderful, magical institution called the National
 
Endowment for the Arts, you had the kindness to invite me to your home
 
for supper with your overview panel.  What delights I discovered!  Art
 
of many cultures gracing your home, delicious ethnic fare and most
 
wonderful of all, a collection of warm, intelligent and talented folk
 
artists and experts.  To be singing along with Pete Seeger as he
 
played his banjo was a thrill.  To listen to Native American songs was
 
special too.  You confirmed for me that night an early suspicion:
 the
 
Endowment was a home for talent, passion, intellectual inquiry, and
 
joy.
 Coming with Frank Hodsoll to the Endowment was the right
 
decision.
 
I miss working with you -
-
 your commitment to excellence, your love
 
for your work, and your marvelous warmth and wit.  My evenings with
 
the winners of the Folk Arts Heritage Awards are among my fondest
 
memories of the Endowment.
 In my view, that initiative stands as one
 
of the most profound contributions to the arts that this government
 
has ever made.  Bravo to you for making it happen.
 
I trust that your retirement will bring you opportunities for further
 
creative efforts and wish you the best for this next new phase.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Bess:
 
It's been almost five years since that day you walked down
 
the 7th floor hall past me at the Old Post Office building
 
and I jumped up from a chair,  knocked it over,  in the effort
 
to introduce myself.
 What a five years!
 It's about time you
 
made time in your life for all the other things you want to
 
do including,  of course, working on that oral history which
 
we began so long ago.
 It is languishing,  waiting for the
 
time to work on it.
 
Bess,  you're one of the best people in the entire world.
 
I've learned more from you than you'll probably ever know and
 
look forward to learning so much more.

January 23,  1992
 
Dear Bess,
 
Your retirement from the National Endowment for the Arts has
 
occasioned many fond memories of the years spent in association
 
with you.
 
It is significant to reflect on how my respect for your brother,
 
Alan,  and his peerless contributions to the growth of the many
 
indigenous
 musics of our country led me to seek out his wise
 
counsel in the effort to establish recognition of the folk arts
 
at the Endowment and,  then,  to learn about you from him.
 T re-
member Alan's saying,  "You need my sister,  Bess."
 
From that time forward,  beginning with your service on the Folk
 
Music Panel and continuing with your appointment to the staff at
 
NEA and the development of many rich,  authentic programs identi-
fied with the vibrant cultures of Americans,  you have demonstrated
 
a level of scholarship and creative leadership,
 which in turn
 
focused their impact nationally.
 Your role as Director of Folk
 
Arts,  moreover,  has been unique at a time when it was critically
 
needed.
 
Beyond these professional accomplishments your personal warmth
 
and depth of caring deeply for all people have lent a special dis-
tinction to your achievements.
 
You will be missed as you retire.
 However,  everyone will feel
 
grateful,  I am sure,  that you with Alan and your distinguished
 
late father,  John A.  Lomax,  assumed an indispensable leadership
 
role in laying secure foundations for the vital continuance of
 
the folk arts in our country.
 
I wish for you long,  happy,  fruitful years in your retirement.
 
Affectionately.
 
F.  Anderson

Dear Bess,
 
Your retirement!
 Now what are we supposed to do?
 Don't think
 
we're all saying that you're indispensable just to be nice.
 
It's true!
 
You've been really extraordinary,  both to the Endowment and
 
the whole arts field.
 No one has been a better advocate
 
integrating art and true,  indigenous culture,  and no one has
 
done so much to make everyone realize that there is one hell
 
of a lot more going on out there than we knew.
 
It was great to be around you in Washington.
 All of us wanted
 
to be as good,  as perceptive,  as persuasive,  as patient,  and
 
just as nice as you've been across all these years.
 
Have a great time with new adventures,  and think of us often.
 
Believe me,  we'll be thinking about you!
 
Much love,  and all the best.
 
Farewell to Bess
 
Long years ago,  as we all know,
 
The Lomax name acquired its fame
 
And won wide recognition;
 
And still the name deserves acclaim
 
For fostering these rare folk arts
 
In rural and in urban parts
 
And nurturing tradition.
 
Bess Lomax Hawes has given cause
 
For general celebration;
 
Perhaps her genes gave her the means
 
To bring to all the nation
 
New pleasures in the treasures
 
Of our heritage and race,
 
New understanding of ourselves,
 
Our time,  our home,  our place.
 
Though Bess retires,  she still inspires
 
Folk arts throughout the land;
 
The program's sure,  and will endure -  
The house she built will stand.
 
So farewell,  Bess,  and may God bless
 
The plans for your new leisure;
 
Your winning zeal has made us feel
 
That every task's a pleasure.
 
January,  1992.

Dear Bess:
 
This letter is written with so many mixed
 
emotions,  for it is hard for me to think of
 
the NEA without Bess Hawes.
 From my first
 
days there as a very green political
 
appointee,  you took me under wing and showed
 
me the beauty and breadth this country has to
 
offer through our rich heritage of folk arts.
 
I will never experience simple things like a
 
basket,  or hand made instruments or cowboy
 
poetry in quite the same way.
 What I've
 
finally come to realize is how many Jan
 
Naylors you've taken under wing over the
 
years.
 
It is selfless public sevants like you who
 
make me so proud of our country and our
 
"institutions".
 Bess,  you are a legend in
 
your own time,  and I wish you much continued
 
happiness as you enter the next chapter of
 
your fascinating novel of life!
 
Thank you for the countless hearts and lives
 
you've touched and most especially,  thank you
 
for touching mine.
 
With great respect and affection,

Dear Bess:
 
A R E A  C O D E  2 02 / 2 3 4

I wish to add a few words to the many thanks to you for your
 
contributions to the Endowment and its Folk Arts Program, and
 
especially for what you have done to preserve and strengthen the
 
arts in the United States.
 
What strikes me about the state of our art i
s how much
 
depends on the vitality of the indigenous, folk arts that you and
 
the staff of the Folk Arts Program have supported so well.  Not
 
only are folk arts included among the finest arts of this
 
country, but they provide the genetic structure from which all
 
serious contributions are made,  in music, literature, visual and
 
performing arts.  What you have done during the past generation
 
will be felt in the development of American fine arts of all
 
kinds for the next century.
 
Folk arts provide the most direct contact between American
 
artists and the major currents of everyday life.
 They democra-
tize American art, provide its principal themes, and pose its
 
most important questions.
 They run through the bloodlines of the
 
rest of artistic life,  largely without explicit recognition.
 
When the best examples of the fine arts capture a common concern
 
to merge art with life,  the folk arts can be found already there.
 
American artists are fortunate to have so much from which to
 
draw,  from so many places and cultures.  They are even more
 
fortunate that you, Bess Hawes, were there, at a critical time
 
and in a crucial place, bringing such sensitivity and care to the
 
projection of our artistic and cultural life far into the future.
 
Sincerely,
 
'

Dear Bess:
 
(

Upon your r
etire ment, I
 j
oin with many o
thers i
n expressing r
espect and thanks
 
f
or your years o
f s
ervice and o
f being who you have been t
o the Endowment and t
o a
ll o
f
 
us i
n the f
ield. The r
espect part may not be so much i
n need o
f putting i
nto words.
 
That has been earned many t
imes over, constantly shared i
n unspoken ways, and
 
r
eaf
firm ed i
n af
fection and e
stee m f
or as l
ong as most o
f us have professional me mories.
 
But I
 f
eel a
 special need t
o express the thanks, t
o so mehow balance the
 
accu mulated debt f
or a
ll the t
imes they haven't been adequately said--as you graciously
 
and with geniune concern endured t
he minutia t
roubling dozens o
f us a
t once, as you
 
hurried of
f t
o another s
top on an overcommitted s
chedule, as everybody t
ook your
 
t
olerance and patient support f
or granted. Thanks f
or being t
he nurturing, maternal
 
spirit we needed t
o shape and guide t
he f
ield, f
or the hu mane presence--at the t
op,
 
i
nside the beltway, o
f a
ll p
laces--we could keep f
aith i
n. Thanks f
or being a
 conscience
 
i
n c
ircles where one needed t
o be heard, f
or helping t
o s
et and r
einforce and r
emind us
 
o

deals. And f
or keeping s
ight o
f a
ll t
hat t
hrough i
nsuf
ferable paperwork, mu mbo-
ju mbo f
ormalities, and endless meetings.
 
You a
lso need t
o hear thanks on behalf o
f countless artists, your com mitment t
o
 
whom has spread through us l
ike sparks i
nto f
ires i
n so many p
laces. L
ike us, t
hey
 
owe you more t
han r
ealized f
or opportunities and experiences t
hat somehow ca me
 
about. Just as we've hoarded t
he l
ion's share o
f enjoyment i
n getting t
o work d
irectly
 
with t
he m, t
oo much o
f their thanks has gotten no f
urther than us. As you l

 hope you can f
eel t
he gratitude o
f a
ll the p
layers and
 
makers, masters and apprentices who never got t

The occasion of your retirement recalls to mind the great impact
 
you've had on the folklore profession and on ordinary people's
 
perception of the folk arts,  especially through your heroic dedi-
cation to establishing public-sector positions in virtually every
 
state and your nurturing of these positions in the face of some-
times less than ideal circumstances. The result is that a broader
 
segment of the American public than ever before has been and con-
tinues to be exposed to the richness and diversity of the nation's
 
traditional arts.
 
On a personal level,  my three years with you,  the staff and rest
 
of the Panel were,  as I've said before,  one of the best of many
 
good times I've had in folklore,  both as a learning experience
 
and for the family-like camaraderie.  It was a genuine pleasure to
 
work with you,  and to soak up a bit of your energy, passion,  and
 
savvy.
 
The legacy you leave to the country as Director of NEA's Folk Arts
 
Program is inestimable,  and I know that on the private level your
 
contributions to the field and the people who make it up will con-
tinue.  I can think of no one who better deserves a pleasurable
 
retirement,  free from political pressures and battles and now able
 
to pursue your own interests. We'll miss your strength and leader-
ship,  but you've woven some bright new patterns into the tapestry
 
of American folklore that will be with us for generations to come.
 
With al
 be
 wishes,

I know,  you are an individual--- just o n e  that has IL
 
axge in the field,  it's hard to believe that you actually
 
-ometimes sleep at night-- or would like to!
 Although I a
 
caking for myself,  I am sure you will hear the same thin :
 
d over--
 what a difference you have made to the field of
 
•
iklore and to the recognition of  folk artists.  Your vision I
 
d amazing repercussions shaping a major new direction of
 
ld with the development of public sector folklore.
 Yot
.
 
phasis on the artists,  on fieldwork and alliances withir
 
vernment proved a shrewd strategy.
 And you never blinked-
ways standing up for your beliefs and speakinc  eloonently abou
 
e'.
 I hope in retirement your voice isn't  si
.
 
.
tnk±ng nad been as  the NEA Folk Arts prograiit was bcin:
 
veloped and you explained to me  "Folklore is basically
 
ndensed statements about the facts of life.
 That's what a
 
so intense and this is the reason why folklorists are so
 
,
urotic.
 The folks are lonely and neurotic too,  so this wa
 
y to set up a mechanism to deliver tender loving care to t
r
 
iks and the folklorists."
 I' ve always liked that image-- i
t
 
very human.
 You never forgot the deeply personal nature of
 
eldwork  -
 .
 c
-•
 
wa
 
 
b y  Songs,  to see that Theodore Roosevelt had written an
 
troduction to it and so aptly put his finger on the nature c
 
iklore,  saying that folklore and folk song were the real
 
-
;pressions of a people's culture.
 The fact that he understoc
 
clearly what folklore was all about and was so receptive tc
 
-
-
-
' ruck me that you must have perceived almost instinctively a
 
an
y on,  how to move the field forward with the aid of a pi
,,
!-
'
 
- ice.
 Your attitudes were
 t riitlona ' V
 within  t
..
 
i
r
nily.
 Maybe this is
 
I know you have be
 
: j
ars at the apparent retrenchment of public sector folkl u
.
 
m e fact that jobs were going begging,  that there didn't seem
 
cc enough good people to fill them,  and that a number of stat
 
were not taking up the positions.
 I' m afraid that is bound t
 
happen.
 In some ways i
i s a healthy consolidation of  the fiell
 
ar
id I think we will see another expansion from that base.

optimistic that other types of alliances will grow-- througho
 
the nrivate sector as well  as the nublic sector.
 This would
 
cti r
 nd
 way.
 i
 
pointed so squarely at one individual.  All of us in the r
 
sector owe you a tremendous debt for your vision,  your
 
perserverence and your unswerving dedication.
 My job here in
 
Vermont is in direct response to your vision,  as are many of
 
programs we have initiated.
 Things may be moving slowly,  but
 
they are moving and despite the downturn of the the economy t

No one can walk in your foot prints,  but you have show;,

 On the professional level,  I am sick at the thought o

 On the personal level I can't think of anyon

Dear Bess,
 
I am thinking, with tears in my heart, that this is the last letter I will
 
write to you with this address.
 How we will miss you!
 The sophistication of
 
your intelligence, the authenticity of your insights, the wisdom of your
 
guidance and experience, the lightness and courage of your spirit, and the
 
depth of your concern and commitment have made so many gardens bloom across
 
the country.
 They have inspirited, nourished and consoled all of us who work
 
in our different ways to help those gardens survive and grow.  When things
 
went well, we thought gratefully of you and your wonderful staff.  When things
 
got hard, we thought of you and were consoled.
 When we had new ideas, or
 
needed help, we picked up the phone and called you.
 There are no adequate
 
words to thank you.
 
All of the Italian American artists who had the chance to meet you, or even
 
see you, remember you, and think of you as an extension of their own families.
 
The last time I was in Naples, Giovanni Coffarelli (who had been here with the
 
Smithsonian and on the Italian music tours) took us to lunch at the home of a
 
friend, a young Vesuvian singer.
 Suddenly, while savoring a fried zucchini
 
flower, he began telling his friend about you:
 "Oh Ciccio, her aunt!  There's
 
a person I wish you could meet!
 She knows everything that's going on, that
 
one!
 She's always around, always smiling.
 She's a great, beautiful woman (un
 
gran bella donna).
 You know, she wears her hair tied in a bun in the back,
 
like our women used to do, and she wears beautiful long dresses that cover her
 
throat and arms.
 She is serious, and sincere."  These were the words of one
 
admirer.
 But I am sure that many others, both men and women, thought or felt
 
the same.  As well they might, because they knew, or sensed, that you were
 
behind them, that you were standing by their culture and appreciated them and
 
would fight for them.
 
You have been at the forefront of a new movement in American cultural life.
 
hope, after rest and contemplation, that you will continue to make your
 
contribution, and bring your message home from another quarter.
 As a
 
distinguished, and a most engaging and original, speaker and writer, you could
 
exert great positive influence on multicultural education (
should that
 
interest you), as well our own field.
 
Bill, who sends you affectionate regards, says you should go into hiding for a
 
year to give yourself a new start.
 We wish you much happiness in this new
 
phase of your life, and are sure that whatever you do, it will be something
 
creative and beautiful, as you are.
 
Warmly, as ever,

Dear Bess:
 
Word has reached me that the National Endowment for the Arts is
 
about to lose you
 -
-
 the agency's most ardent protector yet
 
most knowing critic.
 Your zeal for folk arts and artists is
 
legion.
 Your knowledge of your discipline is unequaled.
 Your
 
charm and grace are unsurpassed.
 
I shall never forget how you inspired us with your impassioned
 
arguments,  or how you impressed a nonbeliever with one of your
 
friendly and smiling,  yet deadly,  "corrections".
 
Certainly,  no longer to have your leadership is a great loss to
 
those in the traditional arts you have so well championed.
 But
 
the void will be felt more broadly,  for all of us in the arts
 
lose you and your work which represent what the Endowment has
 
been in its best moments  .
 .
 .
 a tireless,  unencumbered,  and
 
honest effort to nurture and create and disseminate art of the
 
highest quality.
 
Many thanks and warm regards.

I look at your retirement with mixed feelings -
 I hate to
 
see you leave NEA Folk Arts, yet I know you will still be
 
involved with folk arts in many other ways.
 Knowing of your
 
love for the Pacific area,  I hope you will be able to spend
 
some time in our part of the world.
 
You have been my mentor during my past six years as a public
 
sector folklorist.
 You have guided my decisions more than
 
you know.
 When faced with a problem,  I often asked myself,
 
"What would Bess do?", and acted accordingly.
 I'm still
 
going to use that successful formula, but every now and t
hen
 
I
'm going to need a dose of personal "Bess Hawes common
 
sense".
 I hope to always remain in close communication with
 
you.
 You always have a place to stay on the Island of Guam
 
if your projects and travels should take you our way.
 Keep
 
in touch!
 
Love,

Dear Bess:
 
Like many other folklorists,  we here at the Wisconsin Folk Museum
 
(Janet Gilmore,  Jim Leary,  and Phil Martin)  don't quite know what
 
we'll do without you.
 We'll be entering the A.B.  era--After
 
Bess.
 
As for me,  I remember very well your willingness to talk with a
 
green graduate student back in the 1970s when I was trying to
 
figure out ways of doing folklore work in Wisconsin.
 In the mid-
1980s,  your kind invitation to serve on the Folk Arts Panel
 
offered an unparalleled education and an essential dose of public
 
sector camaraderie at a time when Janet and I were finding our
 
way as free lance folklorists.
 And while serving on the panel,  I
 
was consistently impressed and often moved by the commitment,
 
intelligence,  and compassion you brought to the job.
 Although
 
names occasionally slipped in and out of your memory,  you never
 
forgot the folklorists,  community organizations,  and traditional
 
artists who labored at the grassroots.
 We folklorists in
 
Wisconsin owe a great deal to your vision and support.
 
So we'll miss you,  but we know you'll continue to work on behalf
 
of the folk arts.
 And we want you to know that our work will
 
always be,  in ways both subtle and apparent,  your work.
 
Our thanks and our love,

Dear Bess,
 
There are a very few people wno can effect great change in an
 
individual, let alone a nation.  People who can bring to
 
humanity the mystery ingredient, the spark that ignites
 
unprecedented growth or the nutrients needed for a s
imple seed
 
to blossom into a mature flower.  People who have the gift of
 
vision, the strength of conviction and the stamina to see it
 
through.  People who make a difference —
 people like you.
 
When I think about the unexpected series of events that
 
directed my life, my studies, my travels for so many years,
 
eventually leading me to the State Foundation on Culture and
 
the Arts, and you —
 I simply marvel and cannot help but think
 
that divinity played a role in it all.
 
Part of me is drawn to write a detailed account of all of the
 
wonderful times we've had together under the auspices of this
 
f
antastic business of Folk Arts.  Of all the ways in which you
 
have influenced me, driven me, inspired, and taught me.  But
 
the romantic in me is lost in an j
zVressionistic swirl of the
 
poignant phrases that linger in my memory fran your letters and
 
speeches.  And I stand in awe of the unfathanable depths of
 
courage and love that have driven you to accanplish so much
 
during your career with the NEA.
 
I
 want to be there at dinner on Saturday night, sitting
 
canfortably in the roan with your admirers and colleagues, but
 
I can't.  So I can only imagine, project myself there as it
 
were and revel in the warmth and magic that I know will fill
 
the roan.  I hope you revel in it too Bess —
 and soak up, the
 
layers upon layers of l
ove and respect that there is in this
 
world for you.
 
I l
ike to remember the dinner we had together during your last
 
trip to Hawai '
i, of Daithi climbing over the seats —
 the first
 
day he decided to wear underpants.  And I fondly think of the
 
gathering at Mr. Nakasone' s house, with his Okinawan supporters
 
making merry with music and song, and you sitting at the end of
 
the roan being plied with sweets and j
uice.  You had an
 
expression that was quite r
emarkable —
 you seemed to be sitting
 
in the eternity of every magical moment you have ever
 
experienced with traditional culture and at once ccvipletely in
 
the present.
 
Bess }awes,  /
3O/92, pg. 2
 
I
 '
m suddenly thinking about what Marie Mc
rald has said about
 
leis.  That it is the transient beauty of a lei that renders it
 
so very precious.  I
t is important, she says, to enjoy the
 
beauty, the color, texture, fragrance -
 all its subtleties -
 to
 
the fullest, while it lasts -
 while it is at its peak -
 and
 
then to let it pass gracefully, without rnorse, rn nberina
 
the beauty and the love and respect it represents.
 
Perhaps there is a metaphor there for your tenure at the NEA.
 
One fantastic accanplishment in a full career, one petal of a
 
substantially challenging yet beautiful flower, or perhaps as a
 
blues singer might say, "One train stop along the road of
 
life."  I knc,w there is more to cane -
 more gifts to give, more
 
challenges to accept.
 
Thank you for being you, thank you for being my mentor and my
 
friend.  Please cx
tie see us anyt
e -
 rd soon.

Dear Bess:
 
Were it not for your sensitive caring/dogged determination/
 
inspirational urgings/and just plain telling us what to do we'd
 
never have been able to:
 
*  Showcase hundreds of folk artists, musicians
 
and storytellers in our festivals, films, and
 
exhibits.
 
*  Develop a facility that in its first year drew
 
over 25,000 people.
 
*  Enrich the lives of Memphians and tourists alike
 
through folk artists in the schools programs,
 
interpretive tours, community lectures, radio
 
and television programs.
 
*  Inform people from throughout our region about
 
ourselves and this place we call home.
 
On behalf of our staff and board of directors and all the people
 
we've been able to present with your help, thank you, thank you,
 
thank you!
 
With best wishes, health and happiness for many years to come.
 
Sincerely,

It  is a pleasure  to sit  down on  the occasion of your  retirement
 
and express some  thoughts about  the  impact your  work has had on
 
American culture.
 It  is  frightening to think what our  nation's
 
culture would be  like at  this point without  the contributions of
 
the  folklorists of the  1930's,  1940's,  and  1950's.
 I have  long
 
admired and been  inspired by the work of Alan Lomax,  Zora Neale
 
Hurston and Stetson Kennedy  in my home  state of Florida.
 Your
 
success  in maintaining  the momentum of that generation and
 
translating  it  into a broad validity  in  the  institutionalized
 
setting of the National Endowment  for  the Arts has had an
 
immeasurable effect  upon how this country  looks  at  itself.
 I
 
fear  the only arts  looked  upon as "legitimate"  would be Western
 
European academically derived  forms.
 This  is a battle we  still
 
fight everyday out here  in the public  sector.
 It  is not a
 
pleasant  thought  to consider where  this  issue would  be  without
 
your work.
 
There  is no way  to measure  how an NEA Folk Arts grant  has
 
inspired both support  and  respect  for  the  indigenous American
 
heritage.
 You and your  work have given us  tools we use everyday
 
to counteract  the entrenched notion that  the art  forms which
 
are local are not valid.
 The NEA Folk Arts Program's  initiation
 
and  support of projects within  state arts agencies has made many
 
friends  in  unexpected  settings  for  these agencies.
 This support
 
and understanding  is essential  for public  funding of  the arts  in
 
general.
 
We wish you well  in your well deserved  retirement,  but please do
 
not go  far.
 The  field  needs your  advocacy even more  in  these
 
times.
 
Sincerely,
 
Loretta Rhoads

Dear Bess:
 
As I said on Monday after you had briefed
 
in your usual splendid way our latest crop of
 
Fellows, I simply cannot imagine the Endowment
 
without you.
 
Ever since I returned to the Endowment in
 
1978, you have represented in my mind everything
 
that is good about the Endowment.
 
You are certainly the Mother of Folk Arts
 
in this Nation and signify what this agency should
 
stand for as far as our mission is concerned.
 
All the best to you -
-
 I hope we may call
 
upon you to cane and address our future classes
 
our door will always be open.
 
It's been a real privilege to know and work
 
with you.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Bess:
 
Was it nine years ago that you came to north Florida for the Triumphant Gospel
 
Singers concert, visited the Bureau of Folklife office, and we drove over to
 
Tallahassee together?  It seems like such a short time ago.
 The memory is one
 
of my fondest from the experience here in White Springs.
 
I know many public folklorists have similar memories of your supportive
 
efforts throughout the country.
 We will miss your presence at the Endowment.
 
Your activism for folk arts has been an inspiration, and your sensitivity a
 
model, for us all.
 
Folk arts programs have much,  in many ways more than during the past two
 
decades, to offer society in the years ahead.
 Your leadership and counsel
 
will continue to propel us.
 I hope your plans include returning to the
 
Florida's Suwannee River valley soon.
 
Cordially,
 
Ormond H
. Loomis,  Chief

The scene  is  an evening early on  in Frank Hodsoll' s
 
tenure  in front of  a fireplace at Camp Hoover.
 We
 
are on retreat  and Bess Hawes  is  singing;  her voice
 
sweet,  modest,  sure.
 
Dear Bess,  as  I think of  it now,  many years  later,
 
it  is those very qualities  that  I have  loved  and
 
admired  in you as  colleague and  spokesperson  for
 
your field.

Dear Bess,
 
Ever since first meeting you,  I have appreciated your
 
goodwill,  advice,  and guidance.
 Your way of dealing with
 
meetings and the bureaucracy and all the other stuff while
 
pursuing the larger goal of cultural appreciation,  equity and
 
fairness has been inspirational--and led to real accomplishments
 
all over the place,  and not just in institutions,  but also in
 
people's hearts.
 Somehow,  you always say the poignant,
 
meaningful thing that cuts to the core; that is felt to be
 
truthful,  purposeful and moral.
 You are an exemplary teacher for
 
numerous colleagues,  young and old,  scholars and artists,  public
 
servants and musicians from here and all over the country.
 I and
 
others here are proud to be among those who learn from you.
 
We have issued a special--one of a kind--Smithsonian!
 
Folkways record,  with you singing, with family and friends.
 The
 
cuts go back to recordings made in 1934.
 The voice in that
 
recording is sharp; your voice,  and the voice you've helped to
 
give to so many others,  still rings clear.
 
On behalf of everyone in our program at the Smithsonian,
 
our best wishes.
 
P.S.
 Attached is a renewable supply of Harry's lemonade tickets
 
for the Mall,  any time,  forever.

Merci for your many years of committed public service and
 
for your kind personal friendship.
 My voice joins many in
 
wishing you a most fulfilling retirement.
 
Like many,  I am a beneficiary of your wisdom and hard work.
 
While you were busy developing the fledgling Folk Arts Program
 
during the mid-1970s,  I was dragging my B. A.  (history)  around
 
from one Louisiana and East Texas oil field job to the other.
 By
 
the time I was prepared to realize and appreciate public
 
folklore,  your vision had provided new career directions and a
 
new approach to the world for me and many others.
 
Your influence has created a sense of family among public
 
folklorists.
 You have been our matriarch,  our teacher,  our
 
protector in the face of formidable foes.
 Your open ear,  always
 
willing to listen and to help,  will certainly be missed.
 
Bess,  may your vision and the fruits of your efforts long
 
persist like the priceless traditions you have helped the world
 
to appreciate and love.
 
Thanks again.
 
With great respect and appreciation,

Dear Bess:
 
Although
 you
 had
 indicated
 that
 you
 were
 close
 to
 
retirement,  the reality of that is hard to imagine.
 
I  consider  myself  extremely
 fortunate  to  have  had  the
 
privilege  of  working  with  you  at  the  Arts  Endowment.
 I
 
learned
 so
 much
 about
 people's
 traditions
 and
 their
 
heritage,  which  has  enriched my  own  life enormously.
 Your
 
deep commitment to your work was an incredible example to us
 
all.
 
Thank  you,  also,  for  introducing  both  Tim  and  me  to  the
 
Heritage  Awards.
 Those  evenings  remain  some  of  the  most
 
moving and inspiring evenings we've ever spent.
 
You are a special person.
 You will be greatly missed.
 Your
 
impact will never be forgotten.
 
With great fondness,
 
ssica L.  Andrews

As a friendly criti c of the two Nati onal  Endowment s
 
si nce thei r  incepti on,  I gave a sigh of reli ef some yea-rs
 
ago when you wer e appoi nted head of the Folk Art s Secti on.
 
P,ri ov- to that moment,  the  "world of musi c"  -neferred to the
 
usual  fare of Carnegie Hall  or the  local  civic symphony
 
hall.
 Thanks,  Bess,  for hel pi ng the stumbli ng,  well -
intenti oned  but  hopel essly  ignorant  cultural  "leaders"  of
 
thi s countr y understand that  the wor d  and world  of  "mus -le"
 
is  incredi bly broad.
 I hope  long-abandoned  anxi eti es about
 
the poli ci es of NEA don' t  return aft er your departure from
 
the Endowment.
 The strength  of your  powerful  directi on,  I
 
a m  s u r e,
 w i I I  e nd u r e  f o r  m a n y  y e a -r
-s.
 
I promise not  to  become maudli n,  Bess,  but  in  gathera no
 
a few thought s for thi s note  I became aware that  ou-r
 
fri endshi p  is older than any other  in my current  years.
 
Never too strong  on the correct  -recoll ecti on of dat es 1
1 are
 
goi ng to hazard  a guess that  we first  met  through Bill  and
 
Peggy Gerry on Pi co Boul evard around  1940.
 Is that  cl ose 7
, 
We haven' t  crossed  paths very often,  but  it  has truly  bee-e
, 
comforti ng to know that  you were representi ng  somethi ng
 
preci ous all  these years.
 I was -relieved to hear you say
 
yesterday that  you will  conti nue doi ng  some of  -the tni nus
 
you' ve been doi ng,  "-recycli ng"  as you put  it.
 
Thanks agai n Bess for taki ng ti me to tal k with  DarFr
j-_
v
 
Heiftz  and me.
 I
' ve  got  a hunch you and  I may  be seeIng  orle
 
another a littl e more oft en than  in the past.
 I hope so.
 
God  bl ess you,  Bess,  and thanks for bei ng there all  these

Dear Bess,
 
On the occasion of your r
etirement f
rom t
he National
 
Endowment for the Arts, we wish to celebrate a
long with
 
a
ll who know you your immeasurable contribution to our
 
national cultural l
ife through many years of f
ireless
 
efforts on behalf of traditional artists and their art
 
f
orms as D
irector of t
he Folk Arts Program.
 
Connecticut was one of the l
ast states to establish a
 
s
lalewide folk arts program despite i
ts cultural r
ichness
 
and d
iversity. Without your v
ision, persistence, and
 
willingness to explore new avenues for state program ming,
 
the I
ns ti
tute for Community Research's Cultural Heritage
 
4r1s Program, which serves artists and communities
 
throughout Connecticut, might still he i
n t
he p
lanning
 
stages. I
n addition to Folk Arts Program funding,
 
Connecticut benefits d
irectly f
rom the training and
 
guidance received by the young Fellow of several years ago
 
who went on to become the program's f
irst d
irector.
 
As our f
riend V
irgillo Cruz, a g
ifted musician, poet,
 
and folklorist would say, you have brought folk arts i
n t
he
 
public sector "
out of the k
itchen and i
nto the l
iving room."
 
We, among many others, will certainly miss you at the
 
NEA.
 
We wish you the very best as you move on to other
 
activities.

and suggesting that we try to keep things simple for the
 
folks out there we are serving.

Aloha to Bess from Ruth and Kate
 
Let us tell you a story 'bout a gal from Texas
 
Who learned music at her daddy's knee
 
She's got a singing brother
 
(We don't know about her mother)
 
But she can sing as well as either he.
 
Well if you are a Lomax,  you don't stay in Texas,
 
You travel the USA.
 
Bess found fiddlers in Kentucky,
 
And potters--she was lucky--
And she learned how children play.
 
She is known in every region
 
From Nebraska to the Cajun,
 
From New England to the far far West.
 
In American Samoa
 
They say b a,  b a,  b a,
 
And they call her good Queen Bess.
 
From Smithsonian to Congress
 
Applause resounds for our Bess
 
Who turned folk lore into art.
 
Made us cherish our tradition,
 
Its roots and its condition,
 
The core of America's heart.
 
Must she really retire
 
And leave poor John Frohnmeyer
 
To figure out Heritage awards?
 
No,  she'll haunt forever the halls of the Endowment
 
She should never ever retire.
 
Yet she'll never return,  no she'll never return--
So Kate and Ruth say hi!
 
There is pie in the sky,  and not just at the Endowment
 
So join us in the Sweet Bye and By--
IT'S NO LIE!

Dear Bess:
 
I wanted to join with the President and your other good friends in
 
congratulating you on your retirement and wishing you well on the
 
outside.
 
Working with you over the past four years has been an enriching
 
experience for me.
 I have been proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder
 
with you trumpeting so many of the unsung heroes you helped shine
 
the national spotlight on.
 For bringing us Sunnyland and Doc,
 
Christy and Mabel, Nati and Wallace, Esther and B
.B., and so many
 
more, we are all in your debt.
 
You have mentioned on occasion the self-deprecating nature of so
 
many traditional artists, how they often defer to those who came
 
before them as the "real" masters.  As we continue to fight the
 
good fight on behalf of these special artists, so too will this be
 
our lament, that this grand lady who came before us was the truest
 
master of them all.
 
You leave behind so many things, Bess, not the least of which is
 
a family of adoring friends.
 I
'd like you to count me among them.
 
Every good wish to you.

Dear Bess:
 
Here it  is Groundhog Day--the day after all your festivities.
 
I imagine I'll see you later today at Joe Wilson's party,  but
 
while the gospel show on WUST-AM shouts in the background,  
,I
 
thought I'd drop you a short note to thank you for all  the help,
 
advice,  conversation and friendship you 've shared with me over
 
the years.
 
Not that I expect it to stop!
 
The way I see it,  you might have a bit more  time  for our bi-
monthly state-of-the-folk-arts luncheons.  Actually that's
 
probably not true since I suspect you are finding many tasks  to
 
devote more time to from lobbying and reading to field visits  and
 
speech-making.  Anyway,  I'll keep expecting to get together,  just
 
maybe not always at  the Old Post Office.
 
Seriously,  Bess,  if not for you,  much of my best work  (as under
 
this  logo)  would have been impossible,  or at least more
 
difficult.  Your leadership in the federal folk culture arena has
 
inspired especially those outside of Washington,  where,  after
 
all,  most of the action is.  Inside the beltway,  let's hope the
 
nineties show some change for the good.
 
Oh well,  we can talk all this over soon.  What are you doing
 
next Wednesday for lunch.
 
Sincerely,

Folk Arts Program
 
1100 Pennsylvania Avenue,  NW.,  Room 725
 
Washington,  DC.  20506
 
Dear Bess,
 
It's hard to believe that I'm writing this on the
 
occasion of your well-earned retirement from the Folk Arts
 
Program.
 Although there have been innumerable adventures
 
along the way,  it still seems like only a few months ago that
 
I was a callow ethnomusicologist,  naive to the ways of folk
 
arts and folk festivals,  coming under your wing at the 1976
 
Festival of American Folklife.
 That was a glorious summer and
 
the beginning of a wonderful series of projects in the folk
 
arts world.
 Little of my continued involvement,  however,
 
would have prospered nearly as much as it did without your
 
subtle guidance and support.
 
I particularly remember you recommending me to Alan,  to
 
help him complete the Cantometrics tapes in late 1976 and to
 
otherwise generally help out.
 I'm still not sure if that time
 
was intended by you as a favor or as necessary dues-paying on
 
the road to higher things,  but it was certainly among the most
 
memorable and powerful experiences I've had.
 Being under the
 
brilliant blowtorch of Alan for seven months was an
 
unduplicable learning experience,  the first of many that
 
happened mostly or entirely through your generous
 
recommendation.
 
I also fondly recall two on and off years with Betty
 
Szabo in Youngstown,  Ohio.
 Those festivals had several
 
extraordinary moments,  and lots of great food  (trips to the
 
strudel shops of Buckeye Road in Cleveland were among the many
 
delights you missed by running the show in Washington).
 One
 
peak was a lullaby workshop.
 Like your Russian friends in
 
California many of these women turned their backs to the
 
audience out of embarrassment.
 Also like your Russian
 
friends,  their music was sublime,  unusual,  and extraordinarily
 
intimate.
 
Best of all the festivals for me were the two in Kansas
 
that I had the opportunity to take charge of in the absence of
 
the nominal leader.
 Two seasons of getting to know Kansas and
 
Kansans as well as I've ever known a state and two chances to
 
try to create something from nothing was fantastic.
 
Personally and professionally these allowed me to begin a
 
skill and career transition that is still in motion.
 Again,
 
the opportunity largely came because of your faith in me.
 
(Being there helped too.
 You have a gift of finding available
 
resources and making them feel as if they were the only
 
possible resources.)
 
Recently having the chance to return as a "lay" panelist
 
for the Folk Arts panel and for the National Heritage Panel is
 
both a delightful circling and a great opportunity to witness
 
you in action again.
 Your skills have only increased with
 
time.
 Your diplomacy,  your abilities to charm when needed,
 
cajole when necessary,  and confront and force without making
 
it seem so are even greater than they were when we first met
 
in 1976.
 I'm sure that you'll find many ways to enjoy some
 
freer time and selfishly hope that as much of it as possible
 
will still be with your field.
 No one can replace you.
 I
 
also hope that you sing more  (I've always been crazy about
 
your singing),  and that we have a chance to share another
 
square dance or two.
 You may recall that I wasn't a very
 
adept square dancer back a while.
 I'm still no Martin Koenig
 
but I've gotten better and can even do an adequate polka and
 
Cajun two-step.
 One day I'll even learn the Cotten Eyed Joe
 
(the dancing,  the singing is easy).
 Tell me when and where
 
and I'd be honored to have the next dance.
 Thanks for
 
everything.
 
Yours,
 
As you pass through the threshold into a new time of
 
opportunity,  please know that we send with you our thanks,
 
respect,  and love.
 You have shaped and nurtured our field,  urged
 
us all to a higher standard of responsibility and effort through
 
your own work,  served as our ablest supporter and most perceptive
 
critic,  and enriched our lives thereby.
 For all this we thank
 
you deeply and wish you all of what you desire.

Dear Bess,

We are sorry that we missed your farewell dinner, but we wanted
 
to send you a brief note to mark the occasion.
 Steve remembers
 
sitting in your office not too long ago,  when somehow you got on
 
the subject of Moe Asch.
 What you said about him comes back to us
 
now because it truly applies to you as well.
 He was an example,
 
you  said,  of  just  how  much  could  be  accomplished  in  a single
 
lifetime.
 
Certainly, several lifetimes worth of work were accomplished by
 
you in the last decade and a half that we have been working with
 
you
 at
 NEA.
 With
 folk
 arts
 coordinators
 in
 50
 states,
 
apprenticeships in place around the country, the National Heritage
 
Awards  inspiring traditional artists and giving them visibility,
 
and  the many  local  festivals  and  events  to which you've  lent  a
 
hand,  it is fair to say that this country is a different place as
 
a result of your efforts.
 
Personally,  we  are  deeply  grateful  to  you.
 NEA  has  been
 
supportive of our efforts both to conduct projects through Queens
 
Council  on the Arts,  and to establish CITY LORE.
 We are deeply
 
committed to,  and thoroughly enjoy this line of work which you and
 
your family have done so much to foster and create.
 
Thank you for everything,  and the best of luck.

 Although we have
 
not spent much time together,  I have always looked to you as a
 
source of inspiration and guidance.
 What a wonderful world this
 
would be if we all could have your sense of dedication,  your
 
sensitivity to artists,  your gentleness and goodness.
 We will miss
 
you terribly but will continue to be inspired by the example you

Every time I go to Jugtown now,  I will think of you.

Dear Bess:
 
I want to take the opportunity provided by the "sweet sorrow"
 
of your departure from the helm of the folk art ship not only to
 
wish you well as you take on the next great challenge but to thank
 
you for all the gifts that you bestowed on me over the last few
 
years.
 
I must tell you that I have always felt privileged by your
 
vote of confidence in me.
 It was a real boost to be invited to
 
serve on the panel and an even greater honor to be asked to chair
 
the panel.
 I learned so much about folklore while under your
 
tutelage.
 The example of your concern for folk artists and the
 
shrewd political judgments you made on their behalf were simply
 
inspirational;  your actions serve as the book and verse on how to
 
do it.
 From you,  I think,  I found necessary fuel for my own
 
"fires" of advocacy for our unheralded artist-heros.
 I hope only
 
to place my feet within the large foot prints you have left for
 
us to follow.
 
Again thank you and best wishes for your next career.
 
Sincerely,

 As a State Folklorist,  I am one of many
 
who,  fresh from graduate school, benefitted from your patience and
 
your guiding hand in dealing with the subtleties and challenges of
 
Public Folklore and Arts Administration.
 I'm sure that many will
 
thank you for this important leadership.
 
But I also want to thank you on behalf of the people of Alabama.
 
Under your tenure at the NEA, Alabama has enjoyed support for many
 
worthwhile  projects  presenting  or  supporting  aspects  of  our
 
traditional  culture.
 I  think  that  if  there  is  one  idea  or
 
philosophy that you and I absolutely share,  it is that our work in
 
Public  Folklore  is  a patriotic  endeavor,  patriotic  both  to  our
 
country and to our respective regions.
 I have always  felt that
 
being an Alabamian was a much more important qualification for this
 
job  than  my  degrees  in  Anthropology.
 Although  we  have  not
 
discussed this,  somehow I have gotten the impression that you feel
 
that your  love and respect  for American people and their varied
 
traditions have been the most important qualifications for your job
 
as director  of  the  Folk Arts  Program at NEA.
 I hope that your
 
deeply felt obligation to American cultural traditions will prompt
 
you  to  continue  to  lend  your  advice  and  guidance  to  Public
 
Folklorists.
 Your suggestions and advice will always be welcome
 
here.
 
I look forward to seeing you next month and I know that I speak for
 
many  Alabamians  when  I say  that  I hope  you  will  be  a frequent
 
visitor to our state.
 
Love,

 I remember thinking how ironic it was

in Oregon.
 You told me the truth.
 
You did everything that was fair to try to keep the Oregon program

Dear Bess:
 
You work in a field of survivors,  so it comes as no surprise that
 
you are the ultimate survivor.
 Yet it's difficult to imagine
 
your field without your ongoing contributions.
 So what will
 
happen to folk arts without you there to lead us all?
 
I first became aware of folk arts while living in Central Europe,
 
and then had to come home and realize that the songs I grew up on
 
really fit into that category as well.
 Then gradually my
 
perceptions expanded into understanding the enormous breadth of
 
the range which the term encompasses.
 That was,  of course,  at a
 
time when there was increasing general awareness of and respect
 
for American folk life.
 
All of this sounds incredibly naive as I write it,  but I'm not
 
ashamed to admit the truth -
-
 or the fact that the folk artist as
 
creative genius was still unrecognized by me,  as by most people
 
in America.
 You have been a critical factor in changing all of
 
that,  and I am very grateful.
 
I'm grateful on behalf of the audience,  which has been enriched
 
by your work.
 But I am especially grateful personally,  because
 
my vision has changed,  my art categories have changed,  and I have
 
changed as a result.
 
You should feel very proud of your achievements,  even as your
 
colleagues,  past and present,  are very proud of you.
 Thanks!
 
Cordially,
 
Tom L.  Freudenheim

Dear Bess:
 
Congratulations on your retirement!
 It is so hard to
 
believe that you will no longer physically be in your
 
office at the Folk Arts Program; however,  I know that
 
you will always be a presence there.
 
Bess, you are so much a part of the world of Folk Art
 
and have really helped shape it into what it is
 
today; a much more visible, acceptable, and dynamic
 
art discipline, while at the same time bringing it to
 
light for so many people, both folklorists and those
 
who are simply interested in the arts.
 For me, you
 
opened the doors to the world of folk art and taught
 
me to love the people, their traditions and arts.
 
And,  I can t thank you enough for this special gift.
 
I hope your retirement is happy and healthy, and
 
allows you to do the many things I know you have
 
wanted to do for so long.
 Please do not go into
 
reclusion, but let us know what you are doing and h
o w
 
you are.
 Great people deserve great things in life,
 
and if there is anything I can do to help make y
o u r, 
retirement more fulfilling, please let me know.
 
Yours truly and affectionately,

Dear Bess:
 
Word has reached me that the National Endowment  for the Arts is
 
about to lose you
 -
-
 the agency's most ardent protector yet
 
most knowing critic.
 Your zeal for folk arts and artists is
 
legion.
 Your knowledge of your discipline is unequaled.
 Your
 
charm and grace are unsurpassed.
 
I shall never forget how you inspired us with your impassioned
 
arguments,  or how you impressed a nonbeliever with one of your
 
friendly and smiling,  yet deadly,  "corrections".
 
Certainly,  no longer to have your leadership is a great loss to
 
those in the traditional arts you have so well championed.
 But
 
the void will be felt more broadly,  for all of us in the arts
 
lose you and your work which represent what the Endowment has
 
been in its best moments  .
 .
 .
 a tireless,  unencumbered,  and
 
honest effort to nurture and create and disseminate art of the
 
highest quality.
 
Many thanks and warm regards.
 
cerely,

What a pleasure to join former colleagues in singing your
 
praises:
 I can't think of an easier or more satisfying letter to
 
I remember well meeting you as part of one of my first
 
assignments at the Endowment--a response to the perennial request
 
from Senator Pell to designate Arts Endowment "diplomates".
 The
 
intelligence,  experience, tact and good sense which marked your
 
guidance to me on that issue have been the hallmarks of your
 
s
e rvic e  
at 
 
th
e  E n d o wme n t .
 
I think you embody the concept of public service better than
 
almost anybody I
've had the pleasure to work with.
 Foremost, you
 
have advanced the interests of folk artists,  and in so doing you
 
have added immeasurably to the commonweal.
 At the same time you
 
have been unstinting in your attention to the issues facing the
 
Endowment and your colleagues.
 I know how much I've benefitted
 
from your wisdom (
and your warmth)  and I
've seen how much the
 
agency has gained.

In  four  years  at  the  Endowment,  I was  privileged  to  meet  many
 
extraordinary people and to learn something of the work going on
 
outside my field.  Among the extraordinary people, you stand out in
 
my fondest and most respectful memories.  And due to you, my regard
 
for the traditional arts is forever transformed.
 
What a special contribution you' ve made to the NEA,  the world of
 
the arts,  and therefore to the condition of our country!

Thank you for your two stanzas. You're damned right I want my own Bess-recording
 
of them. How wrong you are about your presence and voice at your party. Both
 
came through loud and clear to me, but then I
've always been on your wave-length.
 
Such an outpouring of generous feeling at your party warmed even my wrinkled and
 
cynical heart. I was asked to write a note that would be among your souviners, but
 
my cranky nature rebelled against delivering my feelings on order to other than
 
yourself. Whatever I have to say, I
'll say direct to you,  who was always a source
 
of light no matter how clouded the agency's atmosphere.
 
Bess-sightings (
at the end of those absurd corridors) always made me feel better,
 
even when we didn't exchange a word. Why? Because goodness has a moral grace, and
 
not having enough of my own, I took from you.  You always had a smile for us, no
 
matter how dark the day. I saw a photograph of your young self with a marvellous
 
smile, and you wear that young smile to this day.
 
You might wonder why I would sometimes linger outside your folk panel door. With
 
your usual courtesy, you'd invite me in and introduce me to various panellists.
 
That wasn't what I wanted at all. All I wanted was the sight of yourself presiding
 
over that huge panel with a grace and ceremony that is a matter of birth and breeding
 
and can't be bought. Why did I linger?
 
Because the panel was unlike all others.  It had a touch of wildness about it that
 
brought back a whiff of the mountains and sea of my childhood where I would hear
 
stories of three wishes, of humps jumping from back to back, and songsin Gaelic
 
that would break your heart.
 I was just outside the door to inhale.
 
Don't forget me when you come back. I
'm looking forward to that lunch.
 
Love,

Dear Bess:
 
Yes,  word has reached here of your retirement.
 
Please accept my heartiest congratulations on your exemplary
 
carrer at NEA.  Your strength,  conviction,  and eloquence have  been
 
a continual  inspiration to me,  and in the often confusing
 
environment of public  folklore you have been for me a kind of
 
intellectual and moral anchor or touchstone.  You gave me
 
confidence when I needed it.  I am deeply grateful to you for your
 
guidance and generosity.  And I know I speak for my whole
 
generation of folklore types--that  "phalanx" marching through our
 
own special part of history.
 
I want to thank you,  too,  Bess,  for involving me  in the work
 
of the Folk Arts Divison.  My site visits were among the most
 
memorable experiences of my life--especially the visit to Amy
 
Skiliman's fiddle workshop at Bethel,  Missouri--and I sincerely
 
hope my reports proved useful  in the granting process.
 
You retirement does not mean,  I hope,  that you wilt no
 
longer speak with us and to us at folklore meetings and so on--
indeed you must,  especially now that you can speak from a
 
position outside of your official responsibilities.  I want to
 
know how our work can be more effective in the current political
 
climate which it seems is every day more inimical not only to
 
folk culture but to cultural life at every level.  Bess,  what can
 
we do?
 
On the other hand,  I hope your retirement brings you some
 
peace and contentment,  too,  and some healthful  recreation.  And
 
song.  That especially!
 
Fondly,
 
Bob Cantwell

Dearest Bess:
 
I am writing to add my voice to the many you have already
 
heard from on the occasion of your leaving the Folk Arts
 
Program of the National Endowment for the Arts.
 
What I have to say is brief but pretty basic.
 The intelligence,
 
sensitivity and power of your work in the arts has had, and
 
will continue to have, an impact on the way America sees and
 
appreciates its unique cultural riches.  You have genuinely
 
set up a momentum for change that is enhancing the quality
 
of our lives throughout the country and is being felt around
 
the world.  You have brought dignity to those long denied and,
 
better yet, have helped millions who would never have had
 
awareness of or access to some of our greatest artists,
 
open their hearts and minds to the fullness of our culture.
 
I cannot imagine America 1992 without your contribution.
 
On a very personal level, I can say that you have changed my
 
life.  While we were both at the Arts Endowment, you encouraged
 
me to go to a Conference on Research in Dance in Hawaii.
 The
 
subject of the conference was dance throughout the Pacific
 
and Asia.  Almost everything I have done in the arts since
 
that conference in 1977 has been shaped by that experience
 
and your generous sharing of information and perspective
 
that helped me understand what I had witnessed.
 
You are the best.
 It is a pity for everyone around the
 
country that you are leaving the Endowment.. .not only for
 
the work you were doing there, but more, because we always
 
knew where to find you if we needed you!!
 
Sin
\ely,
 
Rhoda Grauer
