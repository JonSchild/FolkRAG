OWEN SLATTERY. 
Written by DAVID DILLON, and sung with great success by JOHN SUEZ. 
in the greatest of all Irish sketches, " The Ash Box Inspector." 
Mr name is Owen Slattery, I 
am a 
cobbler by trade ; 
By mending your shoes int; motley I 
made. 
I 
have a 
devil's own wife, I 
wish she was dead ; 
She call sing tralaloo, and she stands on her head. 
It was only List night that me daughter Kate Ann, 
invited to supper a 
handsome young man. 
"When asked his name, he said it was Spoons, 
Recommended by Barnum for juggling spittoons. 
Me fine laddie buck, says I, march out of here, 
Or be the ghost of old Foley, I 
will bite off your ear. 
He made a 
rush for the door, with a 
lump on his skull. 
He thought I 
was Ajax, or else Sitting Bull. 
Me wife, in a 
flutter, seized hold of a 
brick, 
And called me a 
slugger and a 
flannel- mouth Mick. 
"Tearanouns," says I, " Ellen, don't give me a 
guy." 
I 
made a 
short stop on the ball of her eye. 
There's Pat McNamara, from sweet Donegal', 
The ash box inspector, elected last fall ; 
He wears a 
gold watch and chain, and a 
scented bouquet 
I 
wish that the d3vil m 
ty wit:1 him fly away. 
it was only this morning 113 sent me a 
card 
To fresco the alley, and whitewash the yard. 
Bad luck to the sucker, if I 
had him here, 
I 
would play seven-up on the edge of his ear.

ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE. 
Written expressly for SHEEHAN and JONES, by BEN B. 
BENTON. 
You may talk about your grand parades, 
Or anything so gay ; 
But we're raising a 
company, 
For next St. Patrick's day. 
With the colors of onld Ireland, 
We'll make the people glad ; 
'Twill be the finest show, my boys, 
That New York ever had. 
CHORUS. 
With regalias looking bright, 
And umbrellas in hand, 
We'll march down to Hibernia hall, 
And there we'll make our stand. 
With the shamrock in our hats, 
And biled shirts looking fine, 
With an Irish band in front of us, 
We then will fall in line. 
We do honor to St. Patrick, 
Onld Ireland's greatest saint ; 
Be gob, whin we turn out, my boys, 
We make the ladies faint. 
With all the Father Matthew' clubs, 
To fall with us in line, 
And noble band of Hibernians, 
I 
tell you ' twill be fine. 
With regalias, etc. 
We'll have the C9th with us, 
Whose show would break your heart ; 
We'll march the city through and through, 
When once we make a 
start. 
And arm-in-arm together, 
The best of friends we'll be, 
From the laborer on the pipes above, 
To the mayor of our city. 
With regalias, etc. 
ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE.—Concluded. 
So now, brave boys, we must off, 
We can no longer stay, 
And if we think we pleased you, 
We'll call another day. 
Your kind applause we hope you'll grant, 
r10 do our best we've tried, 
So don't forget us Irish boys, 
That stand here side by side. 
With regalias, etc. 
THE RAMBLING PAIR. 
Sung by SHEEHAN and JONES. 
-W E'RE an Irish couple from county Galway, 
So pay attention to what we say ; 
We left our parents and all relations, 
And sailed off to America. 
We'll describe our journey throughout the country, 
For with health and strength I'm sure we're blest, 
We packed our trunks, and off we started ; 
We were determined to go West. 
CHORUS. 
We travelled far, on boats and cars, 
We've had our share of trials and care ; 
So we'll have you know-, 
before we go, 
That we are known as the Rambling Pair. 
From New York unto Nebraska, 
You know that is a 
great many miles ; 
We were in California and Alaska 
As for money we have piles ; 
To Missouri and Iowa, 
To the wilds of Texas we went there, 
We've travelled east, north, west and south, 
And now we're known as the Rambling Pair. 
We travelled far, etc.. 
Written by C. rt. DocKsTADEn, for SHEEHAN and JONES. 
On we live about a 
mile from here, 
And as we came down the street, 
Not thinking any harm at all, 
Some blackguards we did meet. 
They said, just pipe thim two auld Tads, 
And stag that dizzy walk— 
Do you's think that they are Turks or what, 
Thim two ould foolish gawks ? 
Ah, thin, ain't we fools to stand such trash, 
Our hearts are almost broke ; 
They called our son a 
kid last night— 
Do they take us for two goats ? 
And our son John do play such pranks, 
That we don't know what to do. 
Fla—Shure he stuffed my pipe with gunpowder, 
SHE. — And he filled my hair wid glue. 
HE.—He took my clothes last Thursday night, 
BOTH. — And he hid them in the shed. 
Shure we could not find thim for a 
week, 
HE.—And I 
had to lay in bed. 
Ali, thin, ain't we fools, etc. 
Sung by PAT IZ .)0NEY. 
MY 
name it i3 O'llalloher, 
I'm a 
man that':-
.. idfinenti,d, 
I 
mind my busines, stop at home, 
My wants are few an' small, 
Some blackguard?, ' totinr day did come, 
They were full cf whiskey, gin and rum, 
An' they took me out in the broilin' sun, 
To play a 
game of ball. 
They made me carry all the bats, 
They nearly drove me crazy, 
An' they sent me out into " centre field," 
But I 
paralyzed them all. 
I 
put up me hands to catch a " fly," 
Holy murther, it struck me in the eye, 
And they hung me on a 
line to dry, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
I 
took t'ilo bat, an' hit the ball 
I 
thtyight, to San Francisco, 
An' thia around the bases 
Three times I 
ran therA 
But thin the gang began to howl, 
An' they said, ( mid man you made a 
fowl, 
An' they rubbed me down with a 
Turkish towel, 
The day I 
played base ball. 
Two reporters begged to know me name, 
An' presinted me Avid a 
medal, 
An' they asked me for me photograph 
To hang upon the wall. 
They said that I 
had won the game, 
Tho' my head was broke and my shoulder lame, 
An' they sent me home in a 
cattle train, 
The day I 
played base ball.

There's the tailor from the " New Cut" doing quite the grand, 
A 
noble from the Vest End with ' is four-in-hand; 
And Mr. Simon Jeans certain viii be there. 
Vith plenty of his people in a 
waggonette and pair. 
Heavy wans from Clerkenvel), fun inside and out, 
Some a 
playin' cornets, others loudly sing and shout 
And in amongst the lot of ' ern you'll see Inc twist and dart, 
Quite happy nod contented in my little donkey cart. 
Spoken.-" Ilion," some swell cries out, " wot cheer, Billy, vere d'yo 
tome from I" " Yere do I 
come from." says I, " from the ditch." " The 
ditch," he says, " wot ditch ?" " Wet ditch ?" I 
says, "bloomin' 
Shoreditch." 
Then when when I 
gits afore ' is drag vith my donkey 'e 
says, " Now then, Billy, vere are ye going to ?" " Vert; am I 
going to,' I 
says, " 
And when I 
gets to Ilepsom, 'mongst the bustle there, 
I 
puts avay my donkey wot 'asn't turned a 
hair; 
Then I 
gits my luncheon, a 
chunk o' bread and cheese, 
Vith a 
gallon jar o' fourpenny at yich ye vouldn't sneeze; 
And vile I 
sits enjoying my werry ' amble fare, 
I 
sees the swells their Chummy and their nobby things prepare: 
But they doesn't heat and drink with a 
better 'cart 
Than me wot goes to Ilepsom in my little donkey cart. 
Spoken.-Yes, there they is, with their 'ampere marked " Fordum and 
Mason." I 
can't afford-urn, not I. I 
keeps the little I 'as to put on my

I

Not for the

And yen the race is over, the great von of the day,

I

All among the Downs in my cart I

Adding to the thousands in the gay and festive throng; 
Stop as I

And yen I

Then if I've won a

Yen I

Spoken.-Gives Billy ' is supper, that's me, and Tommy a

MY MARY ANN. 
Sung to great applause by JOHN CONROY. 
On, I 
have a 
girl—she looks like a 
queen— 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen; 
She's just like a 
fairy you'd see in your dream, 
And in fact she's the sweetest that ever was seen ; 
She plays the piano, and sings " Aileen Allauna,", 
With a 
-voice so soprano, so low, and so sweet ; 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney,*' 
She frightens the people all off from the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you should see Mary, so sly and contrary; 
She's like a 
canary from sweet Tipperary ; 
She is not a 
bit airy ; she 'tends to her dairy, 
So airy—contrary--is my Mary Ann. 
I 
took Mary one night to a 
massacre ball, 
To a 
place down below they call Wall Halla Hall, 
And when she got there, she went straight for the grub ; 
The way that she eat was like filling a 
tub. 
She called for the turkey, the quail, and the oysters ; 
She ate onions and garlic, to make her breath sweet; 
But her mouth when it opened her breath was so strong 
That it knocked the people clean off from their seats. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
You'll find her at all of the blow-outs and parties, 
She dances the polka, mazurka and all ; 
And when she is at it she goes it so hearty 
That she knocks the plaster all off from the wall. 
We were down at McNally's one night at a 
party, 
And to make things look lively, she whipped off her 
shoes. 
Her feet, when she shook them, threw out such a 
flavor, 
That it drove all the people clean out of the room. 
9h, .you should see Mary, etc. 
DANCING IN THE SUNLIGHT. 
Written and composed by JAMES MAAS for the GIRARD BROTHERS, and 
sung by them with immense success, at the Howard Athemeum, 
Boston. 
W HAT a 
pleasure there is in dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
With ringing notes from pearly throats, 
We while the hours away ; 
With beaming smile our time beguile, 
We are always blithe and gay. 
Oh, what a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark ! hear the music ring, (sym.) 
Shout, shout I 
raise your voice and sing. (
sym.) 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
When all earth seems to smile ; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the sunlight, 
For it will make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light. 
Oh ! What a 
pleasure there is dancing in the suraigilt, 
When all earth seems to smile; 
It makes a 
merry ringing in your laughter, 
You have no care or guile. 
Hark, Lark, eta.

THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLY. 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar; 
Who, in our late war received no scar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
You alchoholic vat, you drunken loon I 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon !" 
"Be Heavens ! 
I'll make you change your tune," 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
The police came in and collared the gang. 
BABY MINE.

I'VE a 
letter from thy sire, 
Baby mine— baby mine; 
I 
could read and never tire, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
He is coming back to me, 
He is coming back to me, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to me, 
Baby mine. 
Oh ! I 
long to see his face, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
In his old accustomed place, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Like the rose of May in bloom, 
Like a 
star amid the gloom, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
Like the sunshine in the room, 
Baby mine. 
I'm so glad I 
cannot sleep, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
I'm so happy I 
could weep, 
Baby mine—Baby mine. 
He is sailing o'er the sea, 
He is coming home to me. 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He is coming back to thee, 
Baby mine.

We follow up the fife and the drum; 
We can't forget our old comrades, 
And their glory at Bull Run. 
It was there with bayonets bristling, 
In the thickest of the fray, 
Where the shot and shell were wh!stling, 
Our boys help'cl gain the day. 
CHORUS. 
We march behind the band, 
True sons of Paddy's land, 
The Irish boys for style are excellent; 
The green above the red, 
With martial step we tread, 
In the gallant Sixty-Ninth Regiment. 
They admit we are the ladies' pride, 
When we're out for a 
grand review, 
They shout huzza from near and far, 
At our Irish boys so true; 
With columns solid as a 
wall, 
Bright uniforms neat and clean, 
We are one and all sons of Erin, 
From the land of the Shamrock green. 
We march. etc.

To the front we'd boldly go; 
For a

But keep our powder dry, 
"Faugh a

To conquer or to die.

THERE are friends you deem true, they will linger near 
you, 
In the flush of prosperity's hours, 
But in poverty's day they will vanish away, 
Like the fading of summer's sweet flowers. 
As you journey along in life's turbulent throng, 
While the bill sides you climb or descend, 
You will see it some day, I 
am right when I 
say 
That your pocket-book is your best friend ; 
That your pocket-book is your best friend. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis a 
friend that you need, and a 
true friend indeed, 
Ever ready to give or to lend; 
For wherever you go, you will find it is so, 
That your pocket-book is your best friend ; 
That your pocket-book is your best friend. 
Our political life is nothing but strife, 
Where all honor is swallowed in gain ; 
But to hint such a 
thing to a 
man of the ring, 
Why of course they would call you insane. 
Many a 
man is in power at this very same hour 
That our honest votes never would send ; 
And the way it is done is quite plain to each one, 
Why their pocket-book was their best friend. 
'Tis a 
friend, etc. 
There's a 
gay young cashier, with a 
thousand a 
year, 
And his horses and ladies and wine, 
Oh, he goes at a 
rate quite alarming to state, 
Though he draws on a 
very big mine. 
They discover, some day, he has gambled away 
Many thousands or more, and the end 
Is, they give him a 
year, after that he gets clear, 
For his pQaket-book is his best friend. 
'Tis a

THE COAL HEAVERS. 
Sung with great success by CONROY and M URPHY, at GILL's, 15 West 
llouston street. 
Oii! here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here keep your eye upon us; 
We load coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
Ha ! ! the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we reach home, our families we embrace, 
And eat our meals with elegance and grace, 
With opposition shovelers we long to have a 
race; 
! 
ha ! the two selected spooners of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
As thro' the streets we walk away like soldiers, 
And the baskets and the shovels we carry on our 
shoulders ; 
And for to get a 
job, there's none that could be bolder 
Than the two selected spooners of the gang. 
On Saturday night we stand upon the corner, 
Along with the gang that has the roll of honor. 
At Hibernia Hall we're going to raise a 
banner 
To represent the Lackawanna gang. 
We all get shaved in the one barber-shop, 
And use the one razor, lather, brush and cup, 
And for bay ruin or Tonic we long to have a 
sup, 
For to stimulate the Lackawanna gang. 
As thro' the streets, etc. 
We accumulated wealth by hard work and endurance, 
With other scallawags we have no interference, 
We have been well tried by work and perseverance, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
With the General Committee we are two great big cards, 
Like Muldoon the Solid Man, we hold our grip in the 
ward ; 
We could put ye on the pipes, or the city Boulevard, 
Oh the two selected spooners of the gang.

His heart was made of Irish oak,

When waddling forth came widow Leary; 
Though she was crippled in her gait, 
Her brawny arms clasped Paddy Carey! 
" 
Och Pat," she cried, " go buy the ring; 
Here's cash, galore, my darling honey." 
Says Pat, " You sowl I'll do that thing." 
And clapped his thumb upon her money. 
Gimlet eye—sausage nose— 
Pat so sly—ogle throws— 
Learing, tittering, jeering, frittering, 
Sweet widow Leary! 
All the sweet faces, 
When Pat had thus his fortune made, 
He pressed the lips of Mistress Le..ry, 
And mounting straight a

In captain's boots struts Paddy Carey; 
He grateful praised her shape, her back, 
To others like a

Her eyes, that seemed their strings to crack, 
'Were Cupid's darts to Captain Carey!

All complete—love and joy.

SPOREN.--I. 
was down town to- day, and I 
had quite a 
chat 
with the mayor. 
I 
asked him for a 
chew of tobacco; he asked 
me what kind I 
would have— fine cut or plug ? 
I 
told him I'd 
have pluo.. Ile gave roe his high hat to chew on. 
I 
then 
jumped on the Bleecker street car; I 
slipped as I 
got on the 
steps; I 
told the conductor he ought to put something on the 
steps to keep people front slipping ; he said he would have put 
some salt on the steps if he thought there was any fresh fellows 
getting aboa.rd. 
Well, I 
rode up as far as the Clipper office, 
and I 
dropped off there, awl bought a 
IfTutd. 
I 
observed all 
the latest news on the bulletins by cable. 
That cable is a 
smart man ; he knows what's goin ,, on in Europe. 
I 
saw that 
Spain hall refused to interfere with the Brooklyn Bridge; that's 
eTeat, loss to cigar signs, 
I 
looked Over the obituary column 
and I 
saw there was plenty of help wanted. " Wanted—a 
thin 
man to go d0 
All ill 
soda water bottles and bring up corks," 
" 
Wanted—a 
man, must weigh two hundred pounds ; to stand 
in front of a 
private dwelling to 
tie horses to him." 
I 
had a 
job like that, myself one time; the boss stopped his horse and 
wagon in front of his door, and of course tied i 
he horse to toe. 
By mid bye a 
band of music came by, the horse started ; he was 
found in New Haven and I 
was found up at flight Bridge. 
I 
gave up that situation. 
I 
got a 
job down at the new Post Of-
fice, standing near the window where the people buy stamps. 
All I've got to do is hold out my tonoue and let people wet the 
stamps, 
I'm courting a 
girl over here in West Broadway I 
go 
to see every night, providing her father and the bull dog are 
out of town. 
Her toothier ain't spoke to me in two years—she 
died in 1874. 
I 
made up a 
son, about her, and went around to 
se- her the other night, aryl I 
sang it.

LETTER CARRIERS. 
Written by JAMES BRADLEY. 
W E'RE employed by the Government yearly, my friend, 
A 
hundred a 
month is big money to spend ; 
While a 
wife and large family on that may depend— 
While we go a 
travelling around ! 
From six in the mornincr until nine at night, 
We're always on our feet ; 
We go over our route three times or more, 
Through every alley and street. 
cooncs. 
Front Station A 
We walk away ; 
The gang on the corner say, pipe the tarriers! 
The door hells we ring, 
The mail we bring, 
The New York city letter carriers. 
There is a 
young damsel that lives on our post., 
If she looks for one letter she looks for a 
host ; 
She's got a 
young fellow, I 
think he's a 
roast, 
lie's as thin as a 
sign or a 
telegraph post; 
She'll stand in the door with her small, dainty shoes, 
And waits for the postman to brino• her good news ; 
He calls out her name, Sarah Jane Hughes, 
Then she feels cheerful and gay 
From Station A, etc. 
It's about a 
month ago, r 
went to Pairlop fair, 
I 
took Sarah for a 
treat, and we looked a 
nobby pair; 
There was a 
lot of us hired a 
van, I 
should think about a 
score, 
But if we count the kids, there would be a 
dozen more; 
There was Mr. Porkie Joe, who thought I 
was a 
dunce, 
And soon got up his larks, so I 
gave him the tip at once. 
Spoken—Yes, Mr. Flash Joe was too fast from the beginning 
so I 
said to him 
CIIORUS. 
You must keep your mawleys off of Sal; I 
don't allow it, 
though a 
pal, 
flit me, smash me, knock me down, but don't you touch my 
gal. 
We soon were on the road, and everything so gay, 
The horses had their load, and a 
good blow-out of hay, 
We had lots of grub in the van, and I 
enjoyed my pipe, 
After taking a 
swig of the can, and Sarah was eating some tripe, 
But Mister Porkie Joe, he couldn't leave Sal alone, 
So I 
said to him again, in a 
sort of an undertone, 
Spoken— Yes, Mr. Porkie Joe was too fast to begin with, so I 
said to him, Joe, 
You must keep your mawleys, 
At last we got to 
e 
fair, and Sarah went in a 
swing, 
And Mister Joe was there, dancing the highland fling, 
Then he bought a 
pea-shooter, a 
whopper, made of tin, 
And every now and then he would drop a 
hot-'un in. 
We went down a 
shady lane, to take a 
slight repose, 
When Mister Joe he dropped a 
horse-bean on Sarah's nose. 
Spoken—Now, that got my monkey up. 
I 
stood the peas, but 
when Sarah caught the bean on the nose, I 
said, " I 
tell you 
what it is, Mister Joe, I 
shall punch your head, if you don't have 
Sal alone!" " Why, I 
never touched her," said Joe. " No," 
says I, " but you laid that ere bean on her nose,"—showing 
Sarah's nose, which had swelled up as big as a 
Jersey crab. " So 
you had better take my advice, 
And keep your mawleys, 
At last he said to me, " I 
think just now you said, 
As how, as if as you could go and punch my head," 
And before I 
d 
time to speak, the left Duke he let fly, 
I 
stopped it—with my beak and the corner of my eye; 
Then we quickly formed a 
ring, and went it left and right, 
The police, they collared us both, and locked us up all night. 
Spoken—Yes, we both were locked up and the next morning 
the beak fined us ten bob a-piece. 
Joe said " he was sorry." 
tom him " it would have been better to have taken my advice, as 
I 
said to him from the first, 
You must keep your mawleys, 
THE KERRY COW. 
Written by PETE CANNON, and sung, with immense success, by him 
through the country. 
Off, I once owned a 
cow 
That was all the world to me. 
She was the fairest creature 
That ever you did see. 
You could milk her in the morning, 
And could milk her in the night ; 
And the milk that she would give you 
Would never make you tight. 
At last I 
got in poverty, 
And had to sell the cow. 
I'd buy her back immediately 
If I 
could get her now, 
For ever since she left me 
I 
haven't had my health, 
And I 
wouldn't sell her off again 
For all the world's wealth. 
Wop a 
darry, etc. 
CHORUS. 
Wop a 
darry, arrah Dan, 
Wopa di:Eddie, darra, ah 
Wop a 
darry, arrah Dan, 
Wop a 
darry, idal day. 
Oh, the hay that she was fed on 
Was as fine as any silk; 
And, signs upon the cow, 
She'd give the very best of milk. 
Like " Old Dog Tray," so faithful, 
She carries her tail behind, 
And a 
finer little creature 
'Would be very hard to find. 
Wop a 
darry. etc. 
PEG OF MULLINGAR. 
his.—" Little Jessie." 
I 
AU going to sing to you about my Peggy, 
A 
briAt-eyed Irish queen ; 
She is the girl that I 
left behind me 
In that little isle so °Teen ; 
Last week I 
got a 
letter, in which she went to state 
If I 
did not forget her that she would emigrate ; 
Oh, how I 
wish that she would only come here, 
And be my guiding star, 
For fairer than an angel 
Is my Peg of Ilullinar. 
For my heart it keeps a 
thumping, 
With joy I'm always jumping ; 
I'm anxious for to see my little beauty ; 
For the day's not distant far 
When I 
will be united 
To Peg of Mullingar. 
You may talk about your dandy Yankee ladies, 
With their fol-de-dols and pretty golden hair ; 
But with my pretty little dark-eyed beauty 
There is none that can compare. 
And when she does come over, to the Far West we will go, 
And there well lire in dorm, in the State of 0-hi-o. 
Now all I 
asl; is that you won't forget me, 
When from you I'm distant far, 
For I 
know that I1I be happy 
With my Peg of Mullingar. 
For my heart, etc. 
THAT'S WHERE I 
KNOW YOU ARE RIGHT. 
As sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
Goon people, I 
ask yoll to listen, 
And heed what I 
say in my song. 
Common sense is the best kind of tutor, 
It teaches us right from wrong. 
There's two ends you must know to a 
string, boys, 
So be careful when you fly your kite, 
Have a 
care that she don't go too high in the air, 
That's where I 
know you are right ; 
Fair play is a 
jewel we must clearly prize, 
So be impartial, my boys in a 
fight ; 
You must always believe what you see with you're eye; 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Whenever you go on a 
pic-nic, 
Enjoy yourselves, have lots of sport, 
Take your girl, your father and mother, 
Good lager beer, sherry and port, 
Don't stand still and look like a 
Quaker ; 
Be merry, cheerful and brio-lit, 
And when there's a 
dance, bounce in for a 
chance, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
It's pleasure, my boys, that keeps us alive, 
So go in for fun clay and nialit ; 
Laulh and grow fat, don't look like a 
cat, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
If you're wise enough to save money 
And send all your children to school, 
The world will call you a 
miser ; 
Just kick 'gainst the world like a 
mule, 
For when you are aged and decrepit, 
From hard work you take a 
respite, 
Thon you will say, `• I'm dry on a 
wet day," 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
For money you know, makes the mare go,— 
Don't be stingy, greedy or tight, 
You can be a (rool fdlow without being a 
fool, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Should you marry a 
bad-tempered woman, 
One tvlio could give yon a 
look 
That would send you out in the kitchen, 
To wash, to scrub, and to cook ; 
Go tie up your thins in a 
bundle, 
Escape from your room in the night, 
As a 
matter of course, take a 
sudden divorce, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
To the ladies, God bless you, I 
say the same thing, 
If your're brute of a 
husband 2ets tight, 
Lock him up in a 
room, beat him with a 
broom, 
And that's where I 
know you are right.

THE rich complain at Fortune's frown, 
The poor grow poorer still ; 
The spendthrift saves his pennies now 
To pay his lodging hill ; 
The miser counts his . ecret.. store, 
His greed he can't restrain ; 
He hopes to save a•tritle more 
When the good times come again. 
Then keep your spirits light and gay, 
And sing this hopeful strain, 
We'll all be happy by-and-by, 
When the good times come again. 
The man of toil is now at rest, 
His rent is coming due ; 
His purse is empty, but his heart 
Is honest, proud, and true ; 
lie smiles at each succeeding cross, 
And does not sigh in vain ;

Her 'kiss he can't refuse ; 
"Just see my little toe, papa,

All he can say is, " Yes, my dear, 
When the good times come again."

The lover looks with wistful eyes

Sae legs him to he ( rood and wise, 
Till brighter days they see ; 
Toy kiss and part ; while in each heart

So no day they 11 wed, but they must wait 
Till the good limes conic again.

ONLY THE WAY ON THE STAGE. 
Bong of the Times, composed and sung by FEED. J. 
:
Namur 
IF you listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you III relate, ' 
Some things J 
saw one night and played on the stage : 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And %vent for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bilis of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new Drama was played on the stage, 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A very sad IcKon, of life's book a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth . his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed ; 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
In the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman from Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed ; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practised each sermon they preached, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
GOOD-BYE TO NORAH. 
Words by SAMUEL N. 
M ITCHELL. 
Music by NED FLonmeoz. 
The Music of this song is published by G. D B,ussaLL & Co., 126 Tremont 
R., Boston, Mass. Price 40 cents. 
SAD was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
I 
left, thee in sorrow, a 
tear in my eye ; 
Thy hills of pure enfrald, the pastures and plain 
Are sights, darling country, I'll ne'er see again ; 
A heart full of sadness, a 
heart that was sore, 
Was mine when I 
left thee to see thee no more ; 
But visions of all that I 
left there behind 
Are flitting so sweetly at times thro' my mind, 
Sad was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
I 
left thee in sorrow, a 
tear in my eye ; 
A 
country I've found that gives shelter to me, 
America, truly the land of the free. 
E3ad was the day, Erin, I 
bade thee good-bye, 
And sad were my feelings when Norah did cry ; 
I 
mit her, sweet jewel, a- waving her hand, 
As tne ship shot away from my dear native land. 
She stood on the cliff's till the dark of the night 
Had shut the fast- sailing craft out of her sight; 
Then to her small cabin she went, well I 
know', 
And wept did my darling, because I 
would go. 
Sad was the day, etc. 
Sad was the day, Erin ; I 
bade thee good-bye, 
But hard I 
viii work, and much harder will try 
To bring the dear creature, the sweet little dove, 
My 
orah, to this, now the laud that I 
love ; 
The Irishman finds here a 
friend that is true, 
The Green waves aside of the Bel, White, and Blue ; 
And all from the Emerald Isle of the sea 
Find welcome in this, the real home of the free. 
WORKINGMAN. 
As sung by TONY PASTOn. 
THE great men of the clay they sing 
About their West End belles, 
Of " Oxford Joe " and " Polly " too, 
And noisy, howling swells ; 
But I 
will sing of another sect, 
And please you, it I 
can ; 
And the one I'll mention in my song 
Is the honest workingman. 
CHORUS. 
For we are not " toffs" or " Immensikoffs," 
And none of the " Upper Ten ;" 
But we belong to a 
glorious band, 
They call the workingmen. 
Some pride themselves upon their wealth 
And stations high in life ; 
A 
married match they always hatch 
Whene'er they take a 
wife ; 
But if true love and virtue should 
Be recorded in the plan, 
Why, as good as any countess, boys, 
Is the wife of a 
workingman. 
For we are not " toffs," etc. 
If misfortune should at any time 
Bring the rich man down, 
He stands as helpless as a 
child 
To brave the world's cold frown ; 
While we instead can earn our bread 
With hard but honest hand ; 
So, to speak the truth, what lord or dub 
Can equal the workingman ? 
For we are not " toffs," etc. 
Some time the great and rich 
Will at the poor man sneer ; 
But where would be their grand estates 
If workmen were not near ? 
So I 
will hold my head erect, 
And say, " Thank God, I 
am 
Old England's boast, from coast to coast, 
The British workingman. 
For we are not " toffs," etc. 
I'm going to sing a 
little song, 
If 
on will list to me; 
It's not too short and not too long ; 
But that you'll quickly see. 
I 
don't say my song will pease you. 
Tim' your verdict I don't far; 
In fact, its a 
sort of song you read about 
But very seldom hear. 
Now, politics are all the rage, 
And bribes are changing bands; 
On either side it's just the same 
No matter how it stands. 
I 
don't say, among politicians, 
That no honesty can be, 
And yet it's a 
sort of thing we read about, 
But very seldom see. 
Divorces are the fashion now, 
Chicago is the place 
Where, if a 
man don't like his spouse 
He goes to cha ,ge his base. 
There are ninny wedded people, 
Who, of course, in peace agree ; 
But then, it's a 
sort of thing we read about, 
But very seldom see. 
The girls are trying hard to vote 
And wear the breeches, too; 
They're trying hard to Doctor us, 
But then, %would never do. 
They would have us nurse the hal ies, 
And to cook and make their tea, 
But then, its a 
sort of thing we read about 
And hope we 11 never see.

I'M THE BOY THAT'S BOUND TO BLAZE.

SKELLY.

York. Price 10 cents. 
My parents are wealthy and live in style 
In a 
mansion of their own ; 
They dote upon me, and if faults they see 
They will never make them known. 
Some chide me and say in a 
gentle way, 
" 
You must change your careless ways ;" 
But it ne'er can be done, for while life is mine,• 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze.

Bound to blaze, bound to Waze, bound to blaze. 
cuorus. 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze ; 
While l'm living 1 
artist, be gay ; 
My pa is rich, and my tea Con't care, 
And I'm bound to blaze away. 
They say I'm so naughty ! the girls I 
mean, 
But they only speak in fun ; 
They know what a 
wen of the world I'm am, 
And the hearts I've lost and won. 
do as I 
please, understand, my boys ; 
Let the world give scorn or praise ; 
For evil or good I 
will be a 
blood— 
I'm the boy that's bound to blaze. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
I 
know all the sports, and the sports know me, 
And I'm welcomed everywhere; 
I 
handle the ‘• ribbons " so wild and free 
All the people stop and stare. 
I 
drive thro' the Park when the day is bright, 
With my pair of shining bays ; 
Sensation is ever my heart's delight, 
And I'm always bound to blaze. 
I'm the boy, etc. 
I 
go to the races and bet my pile, 
Win or lose, it's all the same, 
For when you're in Rome you must feel at home, 
Never mind the future blame. 
Sometimes I 
awake with a 
great headache, 
And my fancy backwards strays ; 
"No matter," I 
say ; " this is just the way 
When a 
fellow's bound to blaze." 
I'm the boy, etc.

Mulcahy was his name, 
And, faith, he bad a

Was noted for her flue; 
She was chief cook in a 
boarding house, 
And at makino, hash was great ; 
She came from the County Dyneoole, 
And her maiden name was Kate. 
She is tall and thin, 
With her crooked shin ; 
Her cheeks was red, and so was the boal 
Of Muicaby's sister Kate. 
She treats me like a 
lady 
When her I 
co to see; 
She takes me into the kitchen, 
And treats me to cake and tea, 
And ofttimes I 
used to sit until 
It was very late, 
And whisp'ring my love story to 
Mulcahy's sister Kate. 
She it' tall, etc,

'Tis strange how fellows now and then 
Stare in a 
lady's face, 
When she walks out to take the air, 
Or shopping place from place ; 
There's one I've met quite frequently, 
His manners they are free, 
He smiles wheneer I 
pass him by, 
" 
Oh, ain't he mweat o3 me!" 
erreitug. 
Oh, yes, he is, indeed ! yes, he is , 
Completely gone, I 
see ; 
And fifty times a 
day I 
say, 
"Oh, ain't be sweat on me." 
I 
meet him every morning most, 
And in the afternoon 
He's sure to pass me, feeling just 
As big as a 
balloon; 
He fixes up regardless of 
Expense, indeed does he, 
He smokes a 
pure Havana, too, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on me." 
Oh, yes he is, etc. 
The other night, when cousin Jule 
And I 
were out to ride, 
We saw a 
fellow driving fast, 
Who soon was by our side ; 
He bowed to us politely, and 
As nice as nice could be, 
And then le gave a 
cunning wink, 
" 
Oh, ain't he sweet on me." 
Oh, yes he is, etc. 
Last Monday afternoon as I 
Was passing down the street, 
I

That is so sweet on me.

I 
ONCE was deep in love with a 
charming little dear, 
And when in her society I 
always felt so queer, 
I 
muster'd up my cheek, and asked her for a 
kiss. 
She blush'd and hesitated, and answered me like this: 
cimatts. 
You can do it if you want to, 
For I 
really can't resist you, 
You are such a 
charming fellow, 
To 
refuse you is absurd. 
As time pass'd on, I 
found I'd have to get a 
wife, 
I 
ask'd her if she'd like to he my better half thro' life 
her answer it was yes, so to papa I 
went, 
And as I'd money plenty, whyl, be quickly gave consent. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
was pretty well fixed, as I 
asked the " Old 
Gent " for his daughter's Ilan", heart, and so forth. and he says : 
" 
Well, I've no objection of :,.itirse ; you know " Galatea 
hasn't 
any money—but as long a you love her, why, that don't make 
any difference—and as to :.earrying he -, 
my dear boy, why "— 
You can do it, etc. 
I 
went with rapid steps to tell her of my plan, 
And found her sitting on the lap of a 
handsome looking man, 
I 
scarce belier'd my eves and started with dismay, 
And as he whispered in her ear, I 
plainly beard her say— 
SPoKEN.—" Never mind, Chai ley ; even if I 
do marry that 
" 
Snoozer," it wor:t make any difference, 1'11 love von just the 
same as ever." 
,7eems-es River 
wasn't 1 
mad— I 
told her she 
was false to me, and that I 
never would marry her— that I 
would 
not believe bar even if she'd make a 
statement—and as for her 
1.riey," why, he could have her and welcome. I 
told her I 
would leave, and she should lever set eyes on me again—and 
t• I : lope I 
may never 
if she didn't say— 
You can do it, etc. 
The moral of my tale you all can plainly see, 
Thit't marry any gill my boys, dm' handsome she may be, 
Unless she loves but you, I 
guess you'll find I'm right. 
They're bound to have a " Charley" when you are out of sight. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, and all I've got to say is, if any of you chaps 
want to marry such a 
girl as that, why— 
You can do it, etc.

Gently speeds the silver brooklet, 
Softly murm'ring on its way ; 
kissed by meadow's fairest flowers,

Till the ripples break and quiver, 
Where the water- falls unfold, 
Changing natnre's sunny mirror, 
To a

Onward speeds the silver brooklet, 
From the mountain to the plain ;

Quiver on its crystal breast ;

Lull my weary soul to rest.

My name's not Smith, nor Brown nor Jones; 
Tell that much I 
don't mind ; 
And as for my address, p'faps some 
Would much like that to find.

It's the custom of the country, 
It's the custom of the country, 
Its the custom of the country, 
And a 
very good custom too. 
Some how I 
always can get on 
The right side of the girls ; 
For flattery is to them often 
Sweeter far than pearls. 
Of course I 
don't mean anything, 
Bat flirt with all I 
can ; 
They say I'm awful wicked, arid 
A 
naughty, sad young man. 
It's the custom of the country, etc. 
I'm looking for a 
wife, but she 
Must have a 
pile of cash ; 
She can play at housekeeping, 
While I 
can cut a 
dash ; 
While she lets me do as I 
please 
We're certain to agree, 
So if there's one that's up to that 
Let her apply to Inc.

Singing holy greetings from the days gone by,

But now we are alone,

Our dear old Uncle Ben. 
He used to roam de cotton fields, 
And help to mow de hay, 
And down de river glide along 
Wid heart so light and gay ; 
De old plantation was his home, 
Among de fields of corn ; 
'Twas in de old Kentucky State 
Where Uncle Ben %' as born. 
Poor old Uncle Ben, etc. 
Dere was no darkey round de place 
Dat massa loved so well ;

While his stories be would tell; 
De children danc'd around his feet, 
And all was gladness then ; 
But now they plant sweet roses on 
The grave of Uncle Ben.

How oft have I 
sat by the brookside, 
Which glides by the old cabin door, 
Where the wide spreading elm tree branches 
Arch the pure pearly fountains o'er, 
And dreamed sweet dreams of a 
future, 
And treasures of love yet in store, 
While the low softly-murmuring waters, 
Were wooing the breeze from the moor. 
CHORUS. 
How oft have I 
sat by the brookside, 
Which glides by the old cabin door, 
Where the wide spreading elm tree branches, 
Arch the pure pearly fountains o'er. 
Yes, oft have I 
sat by the brookside, 
With a 
light heart which innocence gave; 
My feet hanging over the waters, 
And leisurely kissed by the wave. 
With eyes gazing on the green branches, 
Which gracefully nodded above, 
My hands idly plucking the daisies, 
My soul in the city of love. 
How oft have I 
sat, etc. 
Thus dreaming sweet dreams of a 
future, 
Beyond this present of strife, 
The elms were the trees of Eden, 
And the brooklet the stream of life. 
Yes, dreaming sweet dreams of a 
heaven, 
Far above this sad world of strife ; 
The cot is the palace golden, 
The brooklet the river of life. 
How oft have I 
sat, etc.

My love will ever be as strong 
As when I 
call'd her wife, my wife, my wife.

ME

I'm a 
carpenter by trade;

Who all my trouble made. 
She'd as many of relations 
As fishes in the sea; 
They ate me out of house and home, 
And destroyed my family.

There's her father, 
And her mother, 
And her sister, 
And her brother-
1700 babies laying on their knees. 
Her uncles and her cousins, 
And aunties by the dozens, 
Lived upon the earnings of Patrick Malony. 
My pints would fit her uncle, 
Her dress would fit her niece ; 
I 
have to sleep upon the roof, 
Or I 
never have no peace. 
They made me buy them dainties, 
Boot-beer by the pail ;

Before I'd gii Inc male.

There was pudding, 
There was mutton 
That would make you bust a

And a

By the name of Pat Cloney, 
To superintend the table, 
To put me in the stable, 
While they ate up all the labor of Patrick Malony.

On, for a 
few minutes pray grant your attention, 
As I 
wish some most comical facts just to mention, 
Thouoh perchance you may think my good sense may be peril-
led 
By trying to make any fun from the Herald; 
At what I 
shall state some folks may look solemn ; 
The part I 
shall read you will be the first column ; 
But explaining the subject is wasting your time, 
So here goes the Personals done up in rhyme. 
" 
Frank, come—I'm in trouble—or address Station D." 
Now, John, mind the dog ; I 
am dreaming of thee." 
" 
If this should by chance catch the eye of Miss Jane, 
She may learn what on paper we cannot explain." 
" 
I'm delighted to hear all passed off so merry, 
Dear Sally. 
Come up to the Hamilton Ferry." 
"Jones has come back—be is a 
bully (-rood fellow." 
"Mr. Smith, please return Mrs. Brown's umbrella." 
" 
Will the lady in black state her name and her age 
To the gent who sat next her in the Fifth avenue stage?" 
"Jerry N., won't you please send me word of some sort 7" 
''Friends may call in on Sunday should their whiskey run short." 
"

"

To see .Nelse Seymour kick his leg high as a

" 
For adoption—a 
sweet little girl and her brother, 
Two orphans without any father or mother." 
" 
George is spending his money, I 
think, rather freely." 
"Jeff Davis sends love to his friend Horace Greeley." 
Kind friends, I 
leave off for fear I 
should offend, 
For the Personals never will coin

And write sotnethin , myself for to-morrow

He has servants, tradesmen, carriages, and animals beside, 
From thorough-breds to coac'o-horses, and hacks to take a 
ride ; 
His darling ugly little dogs, his jewelry, his plate— 
In fact, he wants for nothing, does this senseless addlepate, 
Who only once, when taken in his yacht beyond the Nore, 
Said that it made him vewy ill, and was a 
perfect bore. 
Cho.—Oh, yes, a 
perfect bore, a 
humid nasty bore, 
He said it made him vewy ill, and was a 
perfect bore. 
Ile has the very best cigars, but never takes a 
puff, 
Ile lights, and looks at them, and thinks that's quite enough ; 
He seldom takes a 
glass of wine—his friends his bottles drain--
In short, the thing's inanimate, as if it had been slain ; 
When having ventured on a 
joke, his set were in a 
roar, 
lie thought he never would again, 'twas such a 
perfect bore. 
Cho.-7was such a 
perfect bore, oh, weally such a 
bore, 
lie said he never would again, 'twas such a

And thus it Matters little where he's led or what is done, 
If that his friends enjoy themselves, he t 
inks it's jolly fun; 
lie lrls no judgment, can't reflect, appreciate or praise, 
Ile was unfortunately born, and so must end his days, 
Without one wholesome thought of j , y, past, present, or in store, 
TI.ere's nothing in this lovely world, but what's a 
perfect bore, 
Cho.—Oh, yes, a 
perfect bore, yes, a 
wetched horwid bore, 
There's nothing in this loving world,but what's a

THE HAPPY FATHER OF THREE. 
A 
PATHETIC EPISODE. 
Words by F. LANGBRIDGE. 
Composed and sung by G. H. MAC]) ERMO ST. 
COME, hush- a- by, dearest of dears ! 
Au ! whaf's to become of poor me '? 
I've only been married two years, 
And this little chap's number three. 
If at such an astonishing rate 
Our family's always increased, 
It's clearly our terrible fate 
To have twenty-seven at least. 
CHORUS. 
Come, old fellow, mayhaps, if you'll swallow your pap, 
Your mind less excited may be ; 
And, my dear little chap, if you won't take a 
nap, 
Whatever's to happen to me I 
He's a 
fine little fellow, of course— 
Now, don't begin kicking, I 
beg— 
Such lungs, and as strong as a 
horse— 
There, that's pretty well for a 
leg. 
Beef, bread and potatoes are dear, 
But babies uncommonly cheap; 
The worst of this little one here 
Is somehow, he won't go to sleep. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Jane's snoring—just listen to that— 
While I 
shiver out in the cold; 
I'll wake her, and give her the brat— 
But no! she might happen to scold. 
17 
THE FIAPPY FATHER OF THREE.—Concluded. 
Come, hush- a-by, baby, kiss, kiss 
• lie only gets wider awake ; 
I 
think after going through this, 
That marriage is quite a 
mistake. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Come, hush-a-by, there's a 
good child, 
The clock's striking three, what a 
fix ! 
I'm getting uncommonly wild— 
They're going to call me at six! 
Of getting the ghost of a 
nap 
My chances appear rather blue; 
Mild measures have failed, so, old chap, 
I'll try what a 
slapping will do. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Stop howling—be quiet, you wretch! 
The neighbors are sure to complain; 
Shut up, or a 
bobby I'll fetch— 
Thieves—murder—fire—pick- pockets—Jane! 
I 
tell you I'm losing my head; 
I'm chilled to the marrow right through, 
And now, ma'am, I'm going to bed— 
Here take him, and sit on him, do! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! be won't drink his pap, and he won't take a 
nap, 
And the clock's struck a 
quarter- past- three, 
And I 
don't care a 
rap if you throttle the chap, 
So long as you take him from me. 
(Throws baby of, and exit frantically.)

THESE hats were made in Dublin town 
In the year of ninety-eight, 
And you can see they are still in style, 
For they look both clean and nate; 
These hats are very dear to us, 
Since we left sweet Dublin Bay, 
And the only time you see them out 
Is on Saint Patrick's day. 
CHORUS. 
We are Irishmen, both heart and hand, 
From far across the say, 
And the only time we wear these hate 
Is on Saint Patrick's day. 
These hats were worn by heroes bold 
That lived in the DWI-aid Isle. 
When O'Connell went to parliament, 
They were then just out in style ; 
They too were worn by dukes and earls, 
For they looked so trim and nate ; 
Three cheers, me boys, for the ould hats 
That were worn in ninety-eight. 
We are Irishmen. etc. 
Oh, when Saint Patrick's day comes on— 
It's the seventeenth of March— 
Then we turn out both brave and stout, 
Everything as stiff as starch ; 
We march alone, and sing a 
song, 
Dressed up in green and blue; 
It reminds us of the good ould days 
When the ould hats were new. 
We are Irishmen, etc. 
THE FLANNEL MOUTH MICE. 
Written by W ILLIAM W ELCH of Simmons and Slocum's Minstrels. 
I 
KNOW you'll have pity 
When you hear what I 
say— 
The way I 
have been treated 
By the blackenards each day, 
Who stand on the corners, 
As I 
pass them by, 
You can hear them say plainly, 
Arrah, " stag the old guy." 
ClIORUS. 
Oh, they yell out, " You terrier, 
Go shoot that hat quick ! " 
They call me a 
chow and 
A 
flannel mouth tnick. 
The other day while a-walking 
I 
went down the street, 
A charmihe young damsel 
By chance I 
did meet ; 
Says I, " You look charming, 
Ah, cushla ma vick ;" 
Says she, " Drop on yourself, 
You flannel mouth !nick." 
Oh, they yell out, etc. 
When election day comes, 
I 
know what they'll say— 
" 
How are you, Mr. 1.1cGuinness, 
how are you 
day. " 
They'll hand me a 
ticket, 
Say, " Go vote it, now quick—" 
I'm a 
tientleman then, 
And no flannel mouth mick. 
Oh, they yell out, etc.

THE SLIGO MUSKETEERS. 
Words and Music by HARRY BENNETT. 
OH, let ye stand from under now and open wide your ears, 
While we relate the story of the Sligo Musketeers ; 
Sure, whin we landed on this soil out West they made us go, 
And we worked at canaling on the Oh—ho—ho; 
But whin the war it did break out it took our job away, 
We organized a 
company and wint into the fray; 
We fought the ragged rebels, boys, for many a 
weary day, 
But they couldn't bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
CHORUS. 
With our ha, ha, ha, ha, hay foot straw, we marched across 
the plain, 
And tnany's the time we thought we'd never see our homes 
again ; 
The rebels fottolil like divils, but their fighting was in vain, 
For they couldn't bate the Sligo Musketeers. 
We fought wid Banks and Burnside, and wid Grant we took a 
hack, 
But the best of all, tho' he was small, was gallant little Mac; 
Faith, if they'd let him have his way, he'd quickly drive them 
back, 
If assisted by the Sligo Musketeers ; 
Sure he knew how to engineer and likewise to command— 
No matter what your station was he'd take you by the hand ; 
Tie looked so noble on his horse when he was in command 
Of us fighting boys, the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, etc. 
But now our lave of absence, boys, is very nearly spint, 
We'd ax. ye all to have a 
smile, but we're without a 
cint ; 
On Erie shares and an such snares our money it is lent— 
I 
t 
completely broke the Sligo Musketeers; 
We'll say, " Good evening, one and all," your pardon, too, we 
crave; 
We did our duty manfully this country for to save; 
May the shamrock and the stars aud stripes in triumph ever 
wave 
o'er the fortunes of the Sligo Musketeers. 
With our ha, ha, etc.

F1VEH. 
Beware the first approaches of this stealthy foe, that cometh 
like a 
thief in the night. 
A change of drinking- water, unripe 
fruit, a 
debauch, a 
slight cold may be the first clutch of Fever. 
It can be guarded against and repelled by a 
timely use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. A person should never 
travel to the mountains, to the sea- shore, or on the ocean with-
out a 
supply. 
Doctors admit this fact, and they don't speak 
well of any medicine unless its merits are very great. 
DYSPEPSIA, the arch-fiend of misery and decay, can 
be cured effectually by a 
persistent use of Merlin's Health 
Granules. Why? Because these Granules go to the 
very root of the complaint. 
They not only drive out the fecu-
lent matter that clogs the avenues of the body, but they in-
vigorate and give tone to the digestive apparatus, and make 
healthful blood flow through every petty artery; then comes 
a 
good appetite, and good food insures a 
lasting cure. 
In the Cholera Years it was found that the first 
thing needed was to drive out of the stomach and bowels the 
noxious germs of the destroyer. 
Nothing is so effectual for 
this purpose as Merlin's Health Granules, for while 
they are very powerful for good they are harmless for evil. 
A child may take them in moderation, while they can be 
made to operate upon the strongest man. 
"I 
DON'T KNOW WHAT AILS MEV" 
how often do we hear this remark. A man or woman grows 
weak, feeble, irresolute. 
As Hamlet says, " Man delights not 
me, nor woman either." 
This feeling arises from many causes. 
Lack of exescise, loss of appetite, deep grief— all these tend to 
render the fluids- of the body heavy, thick, sluggish. 
There 
was a 
health-lesson taught by the angel stirring the pool be-
fore the sick got any benefit. 
from its waters. 
It needed action, 
vitalizing with pure air. 
This is precisely the effect produced 
by Merlin's Health Granules, The sluices are cleaned, 
and the nutriment finds its way where it is wanted and can do 
most good.

However doctors may differ as to the exact cause of this 
fearful disease, they all agree upon one thing, that poisonous 
atoms have found their way into the system. 
Common sense 
tells us that the way to cure this disease is to expel these 
poisonous atoms. 
This is effectually done by a 
free use of 
Merlin's Health Granules. Not only do they cleanse 
the bowels of the perilous stuff that to retain is fatal, but they 
restore the blood to activity, and make it pay frequent visits to 
the lungs, where it becomes aerated and full of health. This is 
purifying at the fountain head. 
Where the source is clean the 
stream cannot be foul. 
Good health and chills and fever of 
course cannot exist together. 
THE GOUT CAN BE RELIEVED, 
if not entirely banished from the system, by using M erlin's 
H ealth G ranules at the first intimation of an approach-
ing attack. 
The G ranules prevent the formation of the 
chalky deposits which, if allowed to become at all fixed, ren-
der the joints stiff, and make them work with difficulty. 
The 
Granules have exactly the same effect upon the joints that 
grease has upon axles and wheels—lubricates the grating 
parts, then the joints work smooth and easy and without any 
pain. 
Try 3Ierlin's Health Granules occasionally if 
you want to bid defiance to that old hereditary foe, the Gout 
WAKEFULNESS AND SOMNA3MULIISli, 
though so different in many of their features, are children of 
the same parents—Indigestion and Torpidity of Blood. 
Both 
et these complaints can be cured in the same way, simply by 
producing a 
healthy, natural digestion. 
It is no use trying 
local remedies. 
You may swathe and bathe and bandage the 
head till you are tired. 
It will not alter the condition of the 
blood. 
You might as well expect to make a 
house healthy by 
whitewashing the outside and cleaning the windows while the 
cellar was reeking with sewer gas. No! the blood must be puri-
fied, or disease will ride rampant. 
Use M er!in's Eiel Otia 
G rannies and Wakefulness will subside into calm slumber, 
and the open-eyed sleep- walker will remain with his eyes closed 
upon the unruffled pillow.

"COME AND LET US REASON TOGETHER.” 
It has been well said that he that cannot reason is a 
fool; he 
that dare not reason is a 
slave; he that will not reason is a 
bigot. 
We do not believe, good reader, that you belong to either of 
these three classes, and therefore address ourselves to you. 
You will have noticed that every Doctor, after feeling the 
pulse, looking at the tongue, and ascertaining the temperature 
of the body, pauses for a 
moment's thought. 
Then he quickly 
asks, " Are your bowels regular '? "• This you will therefore 
notice is the very key-note by which he seeks to know 
whether you aro healthy or diseased. 
By further questions in 
the same direction he learns the particular nature of the dis-
ease. 
But no odds how many different points he may wander 
to, he soon returns to the digestive organs. 
The disease may be most apparent in the lungs, the kidneys, 
the heart, the liver, the head ; but it is always the bowels he 
treats as the salient point of disease that has to be first treated, 
hence the first medicine prescribed is a 
dose to act upon the 
organs of dt 
tion. 
This is wisdom. 
The doctor knows that 
without thorough digestion half the food taken is 
worse than useless. 
As certain things strewn around become 
incorporated with the soil and nourish it (left in a 
compact 
heap they breed disease), so without an active digestion food is 
hurtful. 
These are truths that no sane man will attempt to 
gainsay. 
What is the remedy? 
Surely a 
medicine powerful 
enough to carry Off all injurious matter, and at the same time 
having such balsamic qualities as will heal any inflammations 
that may have arisen in the lining of the different ducts. 
Now 
the very best thing that can be used to do what all doctors 
recommend is Merlin's Illeaah Granules. 
Pleasant 
to take, easy in operation, and leaving lasting good effects after 
their use. 
This is homely, sound doctrine. 
Try, and be con-
vinced. 
Merlin's Health Granules do not compete 
with any other aperient medicine; they simply extinguish 
them. 
The sun don't fight with a 
penny dip, it merely out-
shines it.
