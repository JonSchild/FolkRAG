How is that for High t 
Arranged and sung by Dick Ferguson. 
To the Opera oft I 
go 
To see their handsome feet, 
The ladies there I 
do declare 
They- look so very sweet. 
One of them winked at. me, 
She done it on the sly, 
But she takes the shine out of them all, 
How is that for high? 
CHORUS. 
Oh 
bow she would prance 
Through the fairy dance, - 
Her heel and toe, aside, step so, 
She danced around so shy; 
kept my eye on her all the time. 
How was that for high? 
Her hair is dark, her eyes are black, 
Her hands are small and white, 
Her bust is large, her feet are small, 
And her chignon's all right, 
HOW IS THAT FOR HIGH SONGSTER. 
Her teeth are like a 
row of pearls, 
Her cheeks are bloom of youth; 
She's a 
beauty very shy, 
But what I 
say is the truth.. 
Ohl how, eta. 
Luch a 
beauteous form you ne'er saw 
In all your born days, 
How often have I 
dreamt of her, 
And all her winning ways. 
To think that she with both her feet, 
By dancing makes a 
living, 
To think that she upon them both 
To.staging has been driven. 
Oh ! heir, etc. 
Belle of Lou'vIlle.. 
Arranged by R. M. Furgoson, sung with great success by the 
famous Charley Pettengill. 
Oh, white forks, listen unto no, 
I'll sing to you a 
ditty; 
It's all about a 
gay young man 
Who arrived from New York City. 
He was a 
handsome fellow, 
And his sweetheart's name was Sally— 
She was the belle of Lou'ville, 
She lived in Congress Alley I 
CHOP. (TS. 
0, yes, this gay young fellow, 
He loved his charming Sally, 
She was the belle of Lou'ville, 
She lived in Congress Alley.

He went to see her often, 
To tell her of his love. 
She called him " dear," " darling," 
And he called her " turtle-dove." 
They lived and loved together, 
He for his pet would die, 
For everything went lovely, 
And that was good for high. 
Oh, yes, this gay, etc. 
Now, things went on quite lovely 
With Billy and his dear, 
Until his wife got wind or the mews, 
And she took a 
trip out here. 
And when she found what he had done, 
On him she had no pity, 
She hit him with the ace of clubs, 
And started for Jersey City. 
Oh, yes, this gay, etc. 
'Fair Shines the Moon to-night. 
Composed by R. M. Ferguson. Sung with great success by 
,Skiff and Gaylord's Minstrels. 
TENOR SOLO. Fair shines the moon to- night, 
Out from her cloudless height, 
And many a 
lady bright 
To the music listening 
ALTO. Come, love, and roam with me 
Far o'er the sea, 
Whilst down on thee 
Bright stars are glistening. 
BABB°. Ply on the oar lightly, 
Steer, boatman, rightly. 
Where the hall brightly, 
..Eivals the day.

11017 IS THAT FOR HIGH SOMISTER. 
FIRST VOICE. Why should such tones decay, 
And fleetly pass away ? 
Hark their roundelay, 
TENOR. And music so cheering. 
BASSO. Such lovely melody 
Echoes far o'er the sea, 
night slumbers cannot be 
To me more endearing. 
Fula, atonus. Our way retracing, 
Homeware rejoicing, 
Repose so embracing, 
Hail dearest home.

When Sally Comes Home. 
As sung by Dick Ferguson. 
Oh I 
I've been so sad for a 
very long time, 
I 
thought I'd lost that girl of mine, 
Who really is an angel divine, 
And I 
have her absence been mourning. 
Oh I 
yes, through her I've been made very ill, 
To her 'twas a 
trouble to keep her hands still, 
Though now it's the ending of six months_on the 
tread-mill, 
And she's coming out in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
Then, oh. shan't I 
be glad 
When Sally comes home. 
Now Sally she was her mamma's pet, 
But unluckily one day she met 
A 
friend of hers, Light-fingered Bet, 
A 
girl much addicted to cheating. 
HOW IS THAT FOR HIGH. SONGSTES., 
0 
They walked in a 
dry-goods store, one day, 
To buy some ribbons and flowers so gay, 
When Sally was seen walking away 
With twenty-four yards of sheeting. 
Then, oh, etc. 
The shopman on her all the time had his eye, 
And called an M. P., then standing by. 
Though _Sarah she for mercy did cry, 
He soon walked her off to the station. 
They took her before the judge on that day, 
A 
most shocking bad case it was, he did say, 
So for six months he sent Sally away. 
To be boarded and lodged by the Nation. 
CHORUS. 
Then won't I 
be glad' 
When-Sally comes home.

Ant.—" Pat's Curiosity Shop." 
Arrah, boys, I 
will tell yez no fable, 
'Twill make you all wonder and laugh 
'Tis of the mighty big Cable, 
They call it the,great,Telegraph. 
It's laid underneath the Atlantic, 
Through caverns, morasses and mire; 
And the fishes play many an antic, 
In dancing their jigs on the wire. 
CflORIJS. • 
Don't say that I 
blow to the nation, 
Nor set down my name for a 
calf— 
I'll tell you without botheration, 
Concerning the great .telegraph. 
It runs along under the ocean, 
Far out of the reach of the eye. 
The mermaids, I 
have a 
great notion, 
Hang on it their " tilters " to dry : 
While Neptune, that jolly old Druid, 
Not having the means to get fire, 
Lights his pipe with electrical fluid, 
That's passing along on the wire! 
,Don't say, etc. 
The tom-cods are glad to be able 
To learn all the news day and night; 
The whale rubs his back on the cable 
When the bloody mosquitoes do:bite. 
The shark stands in wonder forninst it— 
With fear they all freely perspire, 
HOW IS THAT FOR MOH SONGSTER:-
And the sword- fishes running a,u,'inst it, 
Exclaim, " Divil take the ould wire!" . 
Don't say, etc. 
It carries the news in a 
minute, 
From Dublin to this Yankee land; 
I'm sure that the divil is in it— 
It's capers I 
don't understand. 
It tells of a 
death or a 
duel, 
How Vic. burned her toes at the fire, 
While Emperor Nap. takes his gruel— 
All this travels over the wire. 
Don't say, etc 
It tells how the Queen of Great Britain 
Takes what little comfort she can, 
In keeping John Brown like a 
kitten,'' - 
Because he looks like " the Happy old Man." 
It tells -how the Prince of Wales tripples, 
Of England's poor down in the mire. 
While Europe's played-out, royal cripples - 
Are ridiculed over the wire!

Dear Old Memories 
Composed by It. M. Ferguson. W. A. Pond & Co., Publishers, 
647 Broadway. Sung with success by Louis Frederick. 
,Oh

Away .from care and pain; 
No more at home they'll bid him " Come," 
With that sweet voice again. 
Yet, let him sleep, while loved ones weep, 
And whisper sad " good-bys," 
Their tearful grief shall find relief 
In " dear old memories."

Then let him rest in the valley's breast, 
On the shore of that beautiful river; 
For the echoes still of his harp shall thrill 
Our raptured ears forever. 
Oh I 
let him rest in the valley's breast, 
Where the birds he loved so well 
Shall gladly come from woodland home,

His praises sweet to tell. 
The jay- bird's note shall softly float, 
In sweetest melody— •

Then let him rest, in the valley's breast, 
His harp is hushed forever; 
He's gone before, to the silent shore, 
Where death no more can sever. 
And while we weep, as he lies asleep, 
And fondly breathe his praise— 
We'll still rejoice, as we hear the voice— 
The voice of " byrgone days."

Music by B. B. Barrett,. 
Bung by 
H. J. Fisher. 
I spied thee, little grass plat, 
Just peeping from the ground; 
For I 
had long been searching, 
My quiet cottage 'round, 
To find some precious token— 
Some dawning of the Spring, 
That to my spirit's yearning 
It might new impulse bring. 
I/OW IS THAT -FOR'lliG•H SONGSTER. 
A 
long and dreary winter 
Hath bound thee with its chain; 
But now the spell is broken, 
And thou canst smile again. 
Now here and there a 
grass plat 
Lies weeping till it die— 
The little stream lets catch the tears, 
And then go dancing by. 
A 
prophet, too, I'll call thee, 
Bright harbinger of Spring, 
And season of the flowers, 
And time for birds to sing! 
New robes of verdant beauty 
Will soon adorn the trees, 
And birdlings' songs be ringing 
On every gentle breeze. 
A 
green and mossy carpet 
Will then o'er spread the plain, 
And the bursting bud and blossom 
Will deck the trees .again. 
Sweet fragrance from the flowers 
Will fill the dewy air, 
And joy will fill each blossom— 
New beauty everywhere I

When sunbeams showered from the 4y, 
And said that he'd come back some day, 
And kissed me when he said good-bye. 
But now he'll not return to me— 
I 
ne'er shall see his face again, 
And heavy tears bedew my eyes, 
While sorrow flits my -heart with pain.

They had ventured all in that bounding ship, 
That danced on the silvery tide.

ROW IS-THAT FOR HIGH SONGSTER. 
Ray Neal he clasped his weeping bride, 
And he kissed the tears away; " 
And he watched the shore recede from sight 
Of his own sweet Dublin Bay. 
Three days they sailed, when a 
storm arose, 
And the lightning swept the deep— 
The thunder's crash broke the short repose 
Of the weary sea boy's sleep. 
Ray Neal he clasped his weeping bride, 
And he kissed the tears away: 
"Oh! love, ' twas a 
fearful hour," he cried, 
" 
When we left sweet Dublin Bay 1" 
On the crowded deck of that doomed ship 
Some fell in their meek despair 
And some more calm, with a 
holier lip, 
Sought the God of the storm in prayer. 
" 
She has struck a 
rock 1" the seamen cried, 
In the breath of their wild dismay, 
And the ship went down with that fair young 
bride

And by its soothing charms, 
Sheds comfort o'er declining years, 
In a 
little shady lane, 
Long before I 
was a 
man, 
Did I 
whisper vows to Heaven, 
And to little Mary Ann. 
Time flew slowly by, 
'Till I 
numbered years did wait;. 
And reached that joyous time 
That gives manhood its estate. 
I 
must now prepare to follow at the plow, 
So runs my song, 
Of the husbandman that cheered theta all 
So merrily along. 
I 
did as- duly bade me, 
.1 And I 
ever sought a 
plan, 
To enable me, some summers 1310r11-
To wed with Mary Ann. 
By industry I 
gained - 
A 
little fortune of my own— 
ror well I 
knevrwhat I 
reap& 
Must first be duly sown. 
So I 
gained a 
little cottage, 
And a 
garden in full store; 
With roses twined with honeysuckles 
Graced my cottage door. 
I 
now was nigh complete,. 
So to perfect make my plan, 
I 
hastened, and I

Olai white folks, if you'll listen, I'll sing to you It

She was graceful, she was tall, witha bolivar water-

While her eyes wore a 
color of sky-blue; 
She always wore a

As she worked her machine very free. 
She was chief engineer of .a 
regiment of gals 
That worked in a 
collar fa.ctory. 
Every morn as 
pass -up the street to my work, 
From the window she would throw me a 
kiss.; 
Now the thing was noticed by a 
handsome young 
man,. 
And he said, " What a 
pretty young miss I" 
I 
took the matter hard, when he sent her up his 
eard, 
And I

And quickly he did put .up ,the stakes,

And knocked heavy on the coffee and cakes.

Down by the margin of our loved stream, 
Where in the twilight hours we used to roam, 
And arm in arm together talk and dream 
Of future days, and build our fancied home, 
Beneath the hanging branches of a 
willow, 
Can now be seen a 
little grass-grown mound, 
Under whose sod her dear head found a 
pillow— 
A 
resting place low in the chilly ground. 
There where the rippling waters murmur by, 
Was laid my Nellie, long, long years ago; 
We thought the place was fit for her to lie, 
Where she so loved to bear the waters.flow. 
And then we thought, perhaps, at times her spirit 
Would hover near around this cherished spot; 
And laid her there that she might ever hear it, 
The singing stream that flowed so near our cot. 
On noiseless wheels the chariot of Time 
Has rolled along, and I 
am aged now. 
Long pilgrim years in many a 
foreign clime 
Have carved their wrinkles deep upon my 
brow;

Since Nellie died I've been a 
cast-a-way— 
Earth has been to me desolate and drear; 
And now I've come to spend my fading day, 
And rest at last along with Nellie here. 
Oh! what sweet forms rise through the mist of 
yars, 
What happy dreams I'm dreaming o'er and 
o'er, 
What seraph tones salute my listening ears, 
As I 
now stand upon the streamlet's shore. 
'Tis but the silver music of the water, 
Reviving all the memories of yore, 
Oh 
letlny footsteps, until death comes, totter 
Where I 
with Nellie used to roam before.

Close beside a 
rippling river, 
Where the sweetest zephyrs stay,

By a

Whose loved image, lot and perished,

Where the forest-path was wildest, 
There she loved the most to roam; 
Where the soft winds blew the mildest, 
Ida made her home. 
Singing like the charming linnet, 
Laughing, bright, and full of glee, 
Each fond look had something in it 
That endeared her form to me. 
There is a 
grave, etc. 
But her soul is now above me, 
'Mid the realms of peace and rest; 
And the form God gave to love me 
Dwells forever with the blest. 
Still, about this grave I 
wander, 
While the Autumn leaves grow sere, 
And on mournful thoughts I 
ponder, 
For my heart lies buried here.

To watch the scenes below— 
To the creek and the creaking old mill, Maggie,

The green grove's gone from the hill, Maggie, 
Where first the daisies sprung ;" 
And the creaking old mill is still, Maggie, 
Since you and I

O'er thy brow a

Go, though visions wildly dreaming, 
Softly on my soul that fell;

And the daisies at our feet.

I'm Happy as a King. 
Sung by the incomparable comic vocalist, Dick Ferguson, with 
immense success, throughout the United Provinces. 
There are many ups and downs, as through this 
world you ramble, 
No matter where you go—go where'er you may; 
And to get a 
bit of grub ' tis a 
hard thing to scram-
ble— 
But push along, go ahead, you'll have a 
turn 
some day 
Now, I 
don't care a 
jot, but take things rough and 
ready— 
Troubles and misfortunes away from me I 
fling; 
And puts up with things rough or hot, like Grub-
bin's old Teddy, 
With my pipe and my pot I'm happy as a 
king. 
There's my wife, she's very tall and slender, 
, 
And, like the ladies generally, very fond of 
tongue; 
If I 
tell her just to hold it, bless you, it offends her, 
So says 1, " Never mind, go it while you're 
young !" 
She Often blows me up while smoking by the fire; 
My pipe sends up the chimney, the kettle begins 
to sing— 
The smoke ascends to the top of the house, but her 
tongue is heard higher, 
But, lor', I 
doesn't mind it, for I'm happy as a 
king. 
The other night I 
was in bed, fast asleep and snor-

When I 
was awoke by a 
thumping at my head; 
And very soon after I 
was out upon the flooring— 
For my dearly belov'd wife kicked me out of bed.

To know all about it you've not long to wait. 
It was my misfortune, you may say it was fate, 
To be led, as I 
was, quite astray. 
My love he was kind, and he treated me well,

Because I 
proved false unto him. 
As the bed you have made, in is so you must lay, 
Is an adage as old as the hills, they do say, 
" 
Forewarned, forearmed," is the one that'll pay, 
I 
wish it had been so with me; 
But I, in the night stole away from my home, 
With this man who " floats in the air ;" 
His " daring " and " grace" my heart it had won,

And he told me his. fortunes I'd share, oh I

" 
Honor thy father and thy mother," you've heard, 
"That thy days may be long," so says the good 
Word; 
But all unmindful of duty, preferred 
The step that to ruin did run. 
Unconscious I 
go to the circus each night, 
Least thought of the sad, bitter end, 
When wedded we'd be, how often he'd say,

glorious life to lead, did intend, oh !

Over its waters wide,

57 
We all have to battle with trouble and strife, 
And wait for the turn of the tide. 
Men of each other are prone to be jealous, 
Hopes are illusions, and not what they seem; 
Life and its pleasures, philosophers tell us, 
Go floating away like a 
leaf on the stream. 
CHORUS.. 
Then try to be happy and gay, my boys, 
Remember the world is wide; 
And Rome wasn't built in a 
day, my boys, 
So wait for the turn of the tide. 
Why people sit fretting their lives away, 
I 
can't for a 
moment surmise; 
If" life is a 
lottery," as they say, 
We cannot all turn up a 
prize, , 
A. folly it is to be sad and dejected, 
If Fortune shows favors, she's fickle beside; 
And may knock at your door some fine day un-
expected, 
If you patiently wait for the turn of the tide. 
Then try to be happy, etc. 
Man is sent into the world, we are told, 
To do all the good that he can; 
Yet how many worship the clink of gold, 
And never once think of the man. 
If you are poor, from your friends keep a 
distance, 
Hold up your head, though your funds are but 
small; 
Once let the world know you need its assistance, 
Be sure then you never will get it all.

What happened to me ' tother afternoon; 
As down the Bowery I

The Goat. 
Aa sung by Johnny Roach, the favorite Irish comedian• 
Alit.—" Gray Aare." 
Now, my dear friends, I'm going to relate; 
If you pay attention, you've not long to wait. 
My father lived in a 
place called Gramote, 
had a 
sow, and a 
cow, and a 
fine billy goat. 
This goat, sure, he had a 
queer, curious way, 
He'd go out every morning, and stop out all day; 
When he'd come out at night, like a 
bull he would 
roar, 
'Till me father gets up for to open the door. 
One day he sat down, and was going to ate, 
The goat leap'd on the table and sthole all the 
mate; 
And without saying a 
word, sure the old dirty 
gommagh, 
He dray his two horns in my poor father's stomach. 
Says me mother to me, " Jamsey," " Yis, maul," 
says 
" 
Take that goat to the market, and sell him, now 
thry." 
The words she scarce spoke, when the goat gave a 
jump, 
And struck me mother, oh gorra I 
such a 
murther-
ing thump. 
HOW IS THAT FOR HIGH SONGSTER. 
61 
Then all the house bate a 
hasty retrate, 
And the goat backed away at the divil's own rate ; 
He spied me father's coat hanging, he gave a 
loud 
bawl, 
Made a 
charge on the " frize," and druv his head 
in the wall. 
Some time after that, they went to look for the 
goat; 
They searched all around ' till they came to the coat. 
All of the goat that was left on the very next day. 
Was only a 
stump of his tail, and it still bucking 
away. 
Par Excellence. 
As sung by J. H. McGuire, the favorite comic vocalist. 
" 
on the Cards for Tammany," 
The " World" is not so old; 
I 
need no " Yellow Passport," 
I 
live on a " Cloth of Gold." 
I'm " Caste" in Good Society, 
They like my nonchalance • 
Where er I 
go, they always know 
The Swell Par Excellence 1 
SPOKEN.— Many fellows stroll down Broadway 
into the " Olympic," because they like the " Streets 
of New York," Gayety being the order of the day; 
but, Stranger than ever, Time tries all, and 
CHORUS. 
I'm Par Excellence, the idol of the day; 
New York, or in the " Hub " my time I 
pass away; 
I'm Par Excellence, in form and field, and dance— 
In fact, in all the sports of life, I'm Par Excellence.

HOW IS THAT FOR HIGH SONGSTER. 
Now, " After Dark" I 
like to roam, 
And have a " Loving imp ;" 
Or at the " Hunt" I'm quite at " Home," 
And with the master sup; 
I'm sweet on " Rural Fellcity," 
Can " Course " when I've the chance; 
And as to give a " Blow for Blow," 
Why, I'm Par Excellence I 
SPOKEN.—Yes, every fellow ought to " School" 
himself in defence of the fair sex, from a " Grand 
Duchess" to a " Lancashire Lass," even though 
she should be a " Woman of the World," or a 
" 
Girl of the Period." 
I'm Par Excellence, etc. 
At Harvard I 
gained a 
B. A., 
Was never reckoned slow; 
And at the side of Liberty, 
A 
Standard-man to row; 
A 
volunteer—was in the Guards; 
My military glance 
Was noticed by the Governor 
As quite Par Excellence I 
SFOREN.—Ah I I mean the gallant Seventh. 
Ours is the, ah, Crack Corps— in which 
I'm Par Excellence, etc. 
St. James I've my chambers in; 
Duns can't make me retrench; 
A 
little " Countess on the Hill" 
Makes me " au fait " in French. 
No Grecian eye to Tammany, 
Where ballet girls do prance; 
To charm the No. 1 
belles my finesse 
Is thought Par Excellence I 
i'm Par Excellence, eto.

Everybody's Friend. 
As sung by the Great Lingard. 
A 
happy, careless chap am I, and boast where'er I 
go, 
That tho' I 
have made many friends, I've not a 
single foe; 
To be a 
genius I 
do not, and never did pretend, 
But move in good society, as everybody's friend. 
SPOKEN.—And having lots of cash 
CHORUS. 
They take me for a 
millionaire, my cash I 
freely 
spend; 
And so I'm welcom'd everywhere, as everybody's 
friend. 
A 
mother once with sixteen girls, to me thus did 
apply: 
"Watch and protect my darling dears, so timid, 
young and shy." 
She said, " Tho' once I 
really thought you marriage 
did intend." 
Then a 
breach of promise action brought 'gainst 
everybody's friend. 
SPOKEN.—Verdict in her favor. 
Damages Ten 
Thousand Dollars 
MoRAL.—Avoid mothers with sixteen grown-up, 
gushing daughters; for in their desperation to get 
them off their hands, they'll do anything, espicially 
if— 
They take me for, etc.

A. married man said, " Jack, my wife and I 
don't 
quite agree." 
The wile she whispered in my ear, " he treats me 
shamefully." 
I 
gave the best advice to each, and of course, why 
in the end 
They made it up, and kicked me out, and now I'm 
neither's friend. 
SPOREN.—The husband was indignant because I 
took her part, and the wife, precisely for the same 
reason, called me a " nasty wretch." 
But I 
don't 
care, for— 
They take me for, etc. 
A 
friend of mine once bought a 
house, somewhere 
close to Rye, 
And meeting me one day, said he, " A 
fool I 
was 
to buy. 
The walls are damp, the windows shake, and burg-
lars oft attend; 
Dear Jack, do take it off my hands, you're every-
body's friend." 
SPOIKEN.—I 
did, and hadn't been in the house 
three nights, before the burglars broke in, and took 
every stick I 
had; and the last ruffian, as he de-
scended the stairs, and got outside of the house, 
looked up to me, at the window, and said :—" I 
say 
old boy—" 
We took you for, etc.
