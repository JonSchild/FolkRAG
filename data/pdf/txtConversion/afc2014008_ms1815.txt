er my own husband had died.  He said that my husband was "a fine,
 
God bless his soul"; and now these are the main words I can think
 
speak about
 
iazarik% John Davis himself.  He too was axf±
 "a fine, lovely  a.
u. 
a a man of courage and courtesy; he was a man of dignity and
 
It; he was a teacher of the young and a preacher of the
 
the last time I saw him, he was standing with a long staff
 
ecause even then he didn't feel too well -

During t
T

i '  last visit to California zi
 
When I heard of his death, I went back to the
 
a
 the Bible together.
 
rite, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lo-
,
 
from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that th.
 
r
iay rest ± from their  labours; and their works
 
:o follow them.
 (Revelations 14:13)
 
John Davis is resting from his labors now, but he did his work we ­
.
 
Jil over the country there are people who are better for having known him,
 
city people and country people, white and black.
 It is hard to say gao

Dear Art:
 
I gather, sines I didn't hear from you, that you didn't make it to New York
 
after all.  Thus, I
'll entrust my corrections for the copy of the brochures
 
for "The Ceorgia Sea Island Singers" and "Buck Dancer" to the U.S. mails:
 
GEORGIA SEA ISLAND SINGERS
 
p. 2.  The sentence beginning on line 4 should read: "No one connected
 
with the film knew such about the lives the Singers led or the distinctive
 
tradition they represented."
 
p
 • 3
 •
 The third sentence in the second paragraph should read t "Edmund
 
Carpenter and Archer Goodwin edited and cut the footage; I acted as editorial
 
advisor; continuity and narration were added later from extracts of a
 
taped conversation, recorded especially for this purpose by Alan Lomax,
 
betve n John Davis, his brother Peter Davis, and Bessie Jones."
 
,  4.  The last line of this page should read: "proceed in a counter-clockwise
 
circle around the church hail, while they act out the"
 
p. 8.  When I left for New York, I gave my original ass to the anthropology
 
department secretary and asked her to xerox it, sending one copy to me and
 
one to you.  My copy arrived containing two page
 In the remote chance
 
that you didn't get any page 8 at all, I
'm enclosing my spare for your use.
 
DUCK DANCER:
 
p. 3
.  The sixth line from the top of the page should read as follows:  "Since
 
Alan Lomax first recorded this music in 1941 for the Library of Congress,
 
returning In 1959 to record Ed Young's band, similar groups have been discovered
 
in the area; and it is becoming clearer that the Mississippi country picnic" etc.
 
I think that's really the whole of it.  I hope I
'm not giving you too much trouble.
 
By the way, Barbara Rahn tells me that "Say Old Man" was shown at the California
 
Folklore Society meeting in Sonoma last week with real success, and that many
 
people asked me where they could rent a print of it.  How is that project coming
 
along anyway?  Have you gotten the final printing processes started yet?
 
Remember we want to order some extra copies when you do.  Also, has Barbara
 
sent you any copy for a brochure?  Blow her up a little if she hasn't.
 
Best reagrds,
 
Bess Lcaax Haves

Dear Art:
 
March 1
8,  1974
 
Here, at incredibly long last, are the contracts for Say Od Man. S
ince
 
I haven't heard from you one way or another, I assume that the arrangements
 
for ordering prints that I wrote you about on March 6 proved satisfactory.
 
I am also enclosing what I hope will prove to be acceptable brochure copy
 
for The Georgia Sea Island Singers and Buck Dancer. 
I know you are not
 
thinking of anything as lengthy as what I
've produced, but I do hope you
 
will read them and think it over carefully before your mind is quite made
 
up negatively.
 I
've found that both films, more particularly the Sea I
sland
  
one, require really solid background information before classes can get the
 
most out of them; and what I
've included in both brochures is really infor-
mation that is not available anywhere else.  Goodness knows what the average
 
anthropology teacher would make out of them without some guidance.  Anyway,
 
this was the best -
-
 and the briefest -
-
 that I could do at this point.
 
I am leaving here in ten days to begin making my way by slow stages to New
 
York; I should be there by the middle of April at the latest and can be
 
reached in care of Alan (
I'll be working for him for a month or so).  Barbara
 
LaPan Rahm, who worked on Say Old Man and knows all about the other films,
 
will be moving into my house while I
'm away, so if I
'm out of pocket, call
 
213-396-2982 and ask for her, or just write me and my mail will be forwarded.
 
I would l
ike to hear how you feel about the brochure copy when you've had
 
time to get round to it.
 
All the best,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

September 25, 1974
 
Thank you for your letter of August 30.  I
'm l
ooking forward to
 
seeing your film and know it will fit the program nicely -
-
 I
've not
 
seen it yet because Radim Films didn't ever send me a copy.  The
 
preview wasn't absolutely necessary, so don't worry about that, but
 
do be sure to bring a print of the film with you to the meeting.
 
I can't predict the length or direction of the discussions at
 
the film session, but with five films they are liable to be shorter
 
than we'd l
ike.
 I just hope to guide them into more comprehensible
 
and useful areas than in the past.
 
Thanks again for your letter and I an looking forward to seeing
 
you and "Say, O
ld Man" in Portland.
 
Yours truly,
