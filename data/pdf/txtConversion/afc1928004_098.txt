Jim, the Carter Lad. 
As sung by J. IL McGuire, the successful comic vocalist. 
My name is Jim, the Carter lad, a 
jolly chap am I, 
I 
always am contented, be the weather wet or dry ; 
Snap my finger at the snow, and whistle at rain, 
I've brayed the storm for many a 
year and can do so 
again. 
CHORUS. 
Crack, crack, goes my whip, I 
whistle and I 
sing, 
I 
sit upon my wagon, I'm as happy as a 
king; 
My horses are always willing, as for me I'm never 
sad, 
None can lead a 
jollier life than Jim, the Carter 
lad. 
My father was a carrier many years ere I 
was 
born, 
lie used to rise at daybreak and go his rounds each 
morn, 
And then he'd take me with him, especially in the 
Spring, 
6 
I 
M, THE CARTER LAD SONGSTER. 
I' 
love to sit upon the cart and hear my father 
sing. 
Crack, crack, etc. 
I 
never think of politics or anything so great, 
I 
hate to hear their fly-blown talk about the church 
and state; 
I 
act upright to all men, and that's what makes me 
glad, 
You'll find there beats an honest heart in Jim, the 
Carter lad. 
Crack, crack, etc. 
I 
think I 
will conclude my song, ' tis time I 
was 
away, 
My horses will get weary if I 
much longer stay ; 
To see your smiling faces it makes my heart feel 
glad, 
So drivers treat your horses kind like Jim, the Car-
ter lad. 
Crack, crack, etc. 
She Shook the Tailor. 
Ant.—" The Sabre." 
As sung with great success by Charles V. Duffy, the plea.sinj 
Dutch comique.

Dot he smothered himself mit hees pants-er-loons.

But do him she durned hir back.

Und do der house he soon vas making dracks; 
But she shouded oud afder him,

The Yorkshire Farmer. 
As sung by J. H. McGuire: 
I 
am a 
jolly old farming man, 
And go by the name of.Xorkshire Sam; 
Hale and hearty, too, I 
am, 
As you roay plainly see. 
Jill, THE CARTER LAD SONO'ITER. 
fl 
I 
remember well when I 
used to prance, 
And join in the merry.village dance; 
But I'm not so young as I 
used to be 
About forty years ago. 
MORES. 
The boys and girls of the village say, 
Whenever I 
happened to pass that way, 
There's good old Sam, the farming man; 
Hurray I 
hurray I 
hurray I 
About forty years ago, my boys, 
I 
took unto myself a 
wife; 
And she has been a 
boon to me, 
And the comfort of my life. 
I 
remember well when she used to say, 
It's a 
pity to let time slip away; 
But we're not so young as we used to be 
About forty years ago. 
The boys and girls, etc. 
remember well in the harvest time, 
When we used to mow the bay, 
We used to get cur home-brewed ale 
In the bottle every day. 
Then were the times to enjoy one's self, 
There was not so much grinding after pelf. 
But remember that I'm speaking of 
Some forty years ago.

Mrs. Johnson. 
As sung by Johnny Roach. 
Oh, I 
have got a 
charming bride, 
And with my life am satisfied,

JIM, THE CARTER LAD SONGSTER , 
She's worthy all the world beside, (hic) 
And so is Mrs. Johnson. 
The life I 
lead is very gay, 
I'm ' bout the town near all the day, 
And generally at ten-pins play, (hic) 
And so does Mrs. Johnson. 
At acting I 
can do the trick, 
Othello, Hamlet or King Dick; 
I 
plays them all just like a 
brick, (
hic) 
And so does Mrs. Johnson. 
At sea I'll manage any craft, 
Aid keep things ship-shape fore and aft, 
I'm a 
first rate b'hoy to steer a 
raft, (hic) 
And so is Mrs. Johnson. 
In legal matters I'm no fudge, 
And can give any here a 
nudge, 
I 
expect soon to be made a 
judge, (hic) 
And so does Mrs. Johnson. 
To eyery fire of course I 
goes, 
And all the companies I 
knows, 
I 
runs with engines and with hose, (
hic) 
And so does Mrs. Johnson. 
But lor, you should just see me box, 
One blow of mine would fell an ox; 
Oh, I 
fetches 'em some precious knocks, (
hic) 
Ah, and so does Mr. .Johnson. 
But, we've tasted deep of wedlock's joys, 
And I

And so is Mrs. Johnson.

Why,

She's Dutch. 
Ate.--" She's Black." 
Composed and. sung by Charles Kimie, the popular Dutch 
mimic. 
My Mattilta Katerina was lofing und dear, 
She got a 
mouth on her reached•from ear to ear, 
She was squint-eyed, und frickled, und she got red 
hair, 
She's just such a

She's just such a

I 
know she was, but I 
don't care, 
like for to look at her; 
I 
know she's Dutch as sauerkrout, 
She's Dutch but that's no mather, 
She's Dutch but that's no mather. 
She lives in a 
place, und they call it Dutch-town, 
lind in the summer morning she go all around ; 
She trys very hard everybody to for to please, 
For she's got a

Shabby Genteel. 
As sung by J. H. McGuire. 
We've heard it asserted a 
dozen times o'er, 
That a 
man may be happy in rags; 
That a 
prince is no more in his carriage and four, 
Than a 
pauper who tramps on the flags. 
As I 
chance to be neither I 
cannot describe 
How a 
prince or a 
pauper may feel; 
I 
belong to that highly respectable tribe, - 
Which is known as the shabby genteel. 
ClIORES. 
Too proud to beg, too honest to steal, 
I 
know what it is to be wanting a 
meat; 
My tatters and rags I 
try to conceal, 
I'm one of the shabby genteel. 
I'm a 
party, in fact, who has known better days 
But their glory is faded and gone; 
I 
have started in life in a 
lot of odd ways, 
But have not found the way to get on. 
[here are only three roads I'm afraid that are left, 
I 
shall have to beg, borrow or steal : 
Cet I 
don't encourage the notion of theft, 
Though I'm awfully shabby genteel. 
Too proud to beg, etc 
THE CARTER LSD SONO STER. 
i 
I 
am dressed in my best, though I 
cannot pretend 
TheA my costume is quite comme ii faut; 
You'll observe that my watch has been left with a 
friend, 
And my gloves are unsuited. for show. 
There are traces of wear on my elbows and knees, 
And my boots are run down at the heel; 
But it's cruel to criticise matters like these 
When a 
man has urown shabby genteel. 
Too proud to beg. 
Still I 
strive to be cheerful in all my distress, 
And I 
bear my bad luck like a 
man ; 
If I 
can't have my way as,to feeding and dress, 
I 
must still do the best that I 
can, 
And remember, good people, that fortune some 
day, 
By a 
turn of the treacherous wheel, 
May reduce one of you in the very same way, 
To the level of shabby genteel. 
Too proud to beg, etc. 
Down by the Diverfilde. 
As sung by Frank Vain Hess. 
Down by the river side I 
stray, 
As twilight's shadows close, 
And the soft music of the spray, 
Lulls nature to repose.! 
Beside the stream a 
maiden dwell* 
My star of eventide; . - 
Pure as the vratev-lily bells,

A

In one to all the world unknown, 
Who's all the world to me. 
Soon, in her early bloom and glow, 
She is to be my bride, 
Where the sweet water-lilies grow, 
Down by the river side. 
Utile VaNcy Home. 
As sung by Frank Van Hess. 
In Carolina's clime I 
spent a 
happy time, 
Along with Rhoda Gray ; 
In a 
sweet little vale, ' midst the cornfield's prime, 
Our sweet little cottage lay. 
CHORUS. 
That cherished spot, forget it I 
shall not, 
No matter where I 
roamt 
Many suns shall set, still I 
never shall forget 
That sweet little valley home. 
Rhoda Gray has passed away, 
'Twas on one summer's night; 
Death's icy hand took her spirit away 
To a 
land more happy and bright. 
That cherished spot, erc.

Queen of the Agfa.. 
As sung by Frank Van Hess. 
Queen of the night, hours of delight, 
Wake for us, darling, oh, linger not long; 
Voices of day die far away, 
Zephyrs no more sing their mumuring song. 
Wake from thy dreams, mid silver-beams, 
Weave thee a 
throne that is lovely and bright; 
Lonely I 
wait down by the gate, 
Come in thy splendor, thou queen of the night. 
Lonely I 
wait, etc. 
Parted from thee, life's weary sea 
Bears me along in my sorrow and gloom; 
Sunny rays fade, night's deepened shade 
Finds me once more near blest island of bloom. 
Past fly the hours, rose-clustered bowers 
Wait for thy coming in dew-gleaming light; 
Dawn on my heart., never to part, 
Come in thy splendor, thou queen of the night. 
Dawn on my heart, etc. 
The Broadway Swell. 
As sung by J. H. McGuire. 
Down Broadway every afternoon, at least, 
Ih the merry month of May. 
I'd take a 
walk my eyes to feast • 
On the girls that passed that way. 
Once I 
saw a 
girl dressed in her best, 
She'd eyes of hazel brown; 
And in accents tender I 
her addressed 
Whilst walking up and down. 
18 
JIM, TIE CARTER LAD SONGSTER. 
CHORUS. 
I 
like to be the swell, 
Flirt with the girls as well ; 
Most any day along Broadway 
I 
like to be the swell. 
*X! 
A handsome shop we chanced to pads, 
With bonnets there displayed ; 
Of course she fancied one first-class„ 
For which I 
forthwith paid. 
A shawl was bought of Spanish lace, 
The fashion new for May; 
She said it would her figure grace, 
For which I 
had to pay. 
1 
like to, etc. 
A 
pair of boots with nice kid tops 
Was the next her fancy caught ; 
She said she liked to see the shops, 
But so very seldom bought. 
Into the shop she gently went, 
I 
hoped they would not fit; 
But they did, and another ten was spent, 
And I 
began to grieve a 
bit. 
I 
like to, etc. 
A 
rich silk dress next met her eye, 
A 
pink, to match the bonnet; 
Oh, ' twas such a 
love, with flowers bright, 
And such a 
gloss upon it. 
But, said I, my dear, pray be mild, 
I can't stand any more; 
Her wants, they nearly drove me wild, 
1 
felt she was a 
bore. 
I 
like to, etc. 
J111, THE CARTER LAD SONGSTER. 
19 
Said she, " Dear sir, I'm much afraid, 
That I 
have proved a 
tie; 
I've only left at hon,e the maid, 
So I 
must say goc,d-bye." 
But, said I, my dear, you must not leave, 
My rage I 
scarce could smother; 
When she dropped my arm, let go my sleeve, 
And walked off with another. 
I 
like to, etc. 
Write Me a Song of My Father. 
As sung by Jerry Kennedy. 
Oh, write rue a 
song of my father, 
And tell me the reason I 
pray, 
You ever write songs about mother, 
Not a 
word of dear father you say. 
Is his love and affection less ardent ? 
Does his heart less emotion bestow ? 
Though the sun to the moon is less ardent, 
Still but one light from both o'er us glow. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, write me a 
song of my father, 
And tell me the reason, I 
pray, 
You ever write songs about mother, 
Not a 
word of dear father you say. 
Oh, think of him when in your childhood, 
With dear mother he'd fervently pray; 
And call you his child and his darling, 
And that God might protect you always. 
Then blessings and kisses he'd give you 
And call you his own pretty boy, 
_ato. 
20 
JIM, THE CARTER LAD SONGSTER. 
When scarce you ,
lould lisp the word father, 
And your heart free from earthly alloy. 
Oh, write me, etc. 
And now that you've grown into manhood,' 
Be grateful to him whose fond care 
Ever guarded both you and your mother 
And as oft dried the sorrowful tear. 
Oh, love him, think not of him lightly, 
Cheer his heart, let it not be opprest : 
Love your mother, but don't forget father, 
Let the one with the other be bles3ed. 
Oh, write me, etc. 
cilour Men!. 
As sung by Professor MeMichoals. 
As I 
walked out one morning down by the Sligo 
dock, 
I 
overheard an Irishman conversing with Tapscott; 
Good morning, Mr. Tapscott, would you be after 
telling to me 
Have you ever a 
ship bound for New York in the 
state of Amerikee. 
Oh, yes, my p1.4ty Irish boy, I 
have a 
ship or two, 
There, lying at the wharf below there, waiting for 
. a 
Crew: 
They are two New York packets and on Friday one 
will sail ; 
At present she is taking in one thousand bags of 
meal. 
Straightway then I 
started, Um 
on the yellow grog 
road, 
JIM, THE CARTER LAD SO.NGSTER. 
22 
And there I 
paid my passage down in solid irish 
gold. 
Such roars of mela-murder! oh, the like was never 
known, 
It's often times that I 
sat down and wished tnyself 
at home. 
The very day we started, ' twas on the one of May, 
The captain he came upon the deck, these words to 
us did say, 
Cheer up, my hearty Irish blades, don't let your 
courage fail, 
To-day I'll serve you pork and beans, to-morrow, 
yellow meal. 
One day as we were sailing in the Channel of St. 
James, 
A 
north-west wind came up to us and drove us back 
again. 
Bad luck to the Josh. A. Walker and the day that 
she set sail, 
Likewise to Capt. Tapscott and his dirty yellow 
meal. 
And then I 
went to Liverpool, I 
was walking thro' 
the street, 
Not a 
penny in my pocket, not a 
mouthful for to 
eat. 
Bad luck to the Josh. A. Walker and the day that 
she set sail, 
For the dirty sailors broke open my chest and stole 
my yellow meal. 
But now I'm in America, and working upon the 
canal, 
To cross the stream in one of these boats I 
know I 
never shall,

But I'll cross it in a 
great big ship that carries both 
meat and salt, 
Where I'll get lashings of corned meat and none of 
your yellow meal. 
It's all the same to Sam. 
Bung with unbounf.e3 applause by George Melville, comic 
vocalist. 
I'm happy Sam, that's who I 
am, 
And you may make a 
bet— 
That nothing you can say or do 
Will make this fellow fret. 
No matter what occurs to me, 
I 
take it like a 
limb 
If trouble comes, I 
snap my thumbs, 
It's all the same to Sam.

It's all the same to Sam, 
It's just the same to Sam, 
If trouble comes, I 
snap my thumb, 
It's all the same to Sam. 
I 
like a 
lass, I 
like a 
friend, 
I 
like a 
brimming cup, - 
But still I'm not particular 
With what I 
fill it up. 
But bitter beer or burgundy, 
Or shandy gaff or sham, 
I 
drain it dry, for what care I, 
It's all the same to Sam. 
It's all, etc. 
I 
used to mope and never hope, 
But sigh and mope again, 
But now I 
find an even mind

SIM, THE CARTER LAD L:ONGSTER. 
Will resist the pain. 
I 
like to speak out what I 
mean, 
And never care to sham; 
I 
don't pretend to foe or friend, 
It's all the same to Sam. 
It's all, etc. 
A 
pretty girl put in a 
whirl 
My brain some years ago, 
And she thought I 
should surely die, 
Because she answered, No! 
But I 
said, darling, never iear, 
Though yours I 
truly am; 
Make no mistake, my heart won't break, 
It's all the same to Sam. 
It's all, etc. 
With bow polite I 
say good night, 
And bici you all adieu, 
And it I've not made many friend; 
Perhaps I've made a 
few. 
To please I 
try, and truly I 
Your humble servant am, 
I 
do my best and leave the rest, 
It's all the same to Sam. 
It's all, etc.

Fairy Queen. 
Sung with great success by George Melville, comic vocalist. 
My love she is a 
fairy queen, 
No paint upon her face is seen,' 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
And very large is her waterfall. 
24 
JIM, THE CARTER LAD SONGSTER. 
Her ankle too so plump and tat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a- pat; 
-Were I 
a 
bee, upon her lip 
I'd stay all day and sip and sip, oh. 
CHORUS. 
She never flirts, she's no coquette, 
She never scolds nor does she fret, 
She's some on style and full of fun, 
I'll bet my pile she's number one. 
I 
took her,to a 
show one night, 
I 
almost knew ' twould please her quite, 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce could say. 
The bell it rang, it rang, the curtain rose, 
A man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love he gave a 
smile, oh. 
She never flirts, etc. 
To see my love next day I 
went, 
To pop the question I 
was bent; 
Alas, poor me, I 
reached her door, 
I 
found she'd gone in a 
coach and four. 
Her mother screamed, I 
loud did bawl, 
She'd took her trunks and her waterfall , 
I 
seized my hat, to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with that circus man. 
CHORUS. 
Take warning boys and never go 
With your sweetheart to a 
circus show, 
For a 
spangled dress is bound win, 
You'll never see your girl again.

Still 11911 Love Witee. 
As sung by II. E. Wilson. 
Still I'll love thee, fondly love thee 
Treasured, idol of my heart, 
Yet by all the stars above thee, 
Mine, and only mine thou art ; 
Every joy of life may perish, 
Every darling hope depart, 
But my love thy love shall. cherish, 
Mine, and only mine thou art. 
Still I'll love thee, fondly love thee, 
Though perchance we meet no more, 
Thought ot mine shall ne'er reprove thee, 
True I'll think thee as before, 
What though clouds are dark before me, 
Flinging shadows o'er my heart, 
Still I'll love thee, fondly love thee, 
Mine, and only mine thou art. 
Still I'll love, fondly love thee, 
Let the world say what it will, 
From my side it's frowns may move thee, 
But in dreams Pa see thee still, 
Death thy soul from earth may sever ; 
And from life thy form depart , 
Still 
love thee, fondly love thee, 
Mine, and only mine thou art.

Where I

JIM, TIrE CARTER LAD SONGSTER. 
That Kitty Slaney gave a 
look, 
And twigg'd bould Sergeant Riley. 
Oh, ho! good Sergeant, here I 
am, 
My stick, I 
well can twist it; 
ir fighting I 
was never shy, 
So, by the powers, I ' listed! 
CII0P.17S. 
With march and fight, and left and right. 
Advancing, now retraiting; 
With a 
rub a 
dub dow, oh, hear the row 
The merry drums are bating. 
They put a 
cap upon my head, 
For fighting I 
was willing; 
I 
ribbons had, blue, white and red, 
And in my fist a 
shilling. 
But wanting duds to make me gay, 
We beat up through the country; 
They clothed me well but made me pay 
The tailor all my bounty. 
With march, etc. 
Oh they made me march, but I 
must stop, 
For I 
thought their capers odd, sir; 
And When I laughed they made me pop 
Into the awkward squad, sir. 
They put stiff leather 'neath my chin; 
They turned my toes asunder; 
k 
Eves right! " they cried, which made me grin 
Just like a 
duck in thunder_ 
With march, etc. 
They gave me then a 
musket strong, 
<Of that no man was prouder; 
A bayonet, and then, ere long, 
A 
leather box and powder.

I 
filled the gun up to the top, 
The trigger I 
did pull it— 
Whist went the piece, but the ramrod, whack, 
Went through the Sergeant's gullet! 
With march, etc. 
Now this the troopers thought a 
bull, 
But I 
thought their laughing rough, sir; 
So I 
always filled the barrel full, 
To be sure and have enough, sir. 
But one day when we had a 
shoot, 
A 
march and other matters, 
I 
fired, and like a 
bould recruit, 
I 
burst the piece to tatters. 
With march, etc. 
Ohl I 
only killed three more that day, 
And wounded one-and-twenty; 
So the captain had me turned away, 
And swore that that was plenty. 
And now 1'11 end this martial song, 
For it does need abridgment ; 
But if I'd stayed in the army long, 
I'd have murdered all the regiment. 
With march, etc; 
Fire Away and Take it Aisy. 
As sung by Harry Holmes, the inimitable sensation eomique. 
Oh! I've just come out to try a 
song, 
To plaze you all, shure, I 
now intend it, 
And if you find it rather long, 
Shure, I'll lave it off as soon as I 
end it. 
I'm always ready at your call, 
And I 
always do my best to plaze you;

Begare, my boys, to make you smile, 
I 
find meself, it's no way aisy; 
Then if you listen to me awhile, 
I'll fire away and take it aisy. 
I 
landed here the other day, 
When through the streets I 
went to roam, sir; 
A 
little blackguard to me did say, 
Arrah, Paddy, my boy, will you ever go home, 
sir. 
I 
tried to catch him by the clothes, 
But off he ran with a 
laugh and ehout, now; 
And putting his finger to his nose, 
Cried, dry up and bust, for that's played out 
now. 
Begare, my boys, etc. 
'Twas dinner time, I 
hadn't a 
cent, 
But I 
always done as hunger taught me, 
Into an ating house I 
went, 
And I 
ate up all the waiter brought mo. 
He gave me a 
coin, ' twas mighty strange, 
'Twas a 
medal, and stamped just sixty cents, sir; 
I 
gave it him back, saying, keep the change, 
My stomach is full, so damn the expense: now. 
Begare, my boy; ',ate. 
A 
coacnman next axed me to ride, 
To refuse him, I 
thought ' twould be a 
pit,t 
So he opened the dure, an' I 
jumped inside. 
And he druve me a1,1 
around the city. 
TIIE CARTER LAD SONGSTER. 
We stopped, he axed me for cash straightway, 
And soon he for police was bawling; 
Then as he insisted on having his pay, 
I 
knocked him down and kicked him for falling. 
Begare, my boys, etc. 
Soon a 
sojer caught me by the fist, 
'Twas Barney Doyle from Dublin county, 
Arrah, Paddy my boy, says he, come and list, 
You'll get five hundred dollars bounty. 
I 
couldn't refuse, so off I 
went, 
For a 
sojer's life is ever so glorious, 
And I've been to fight with the sixty-ninth, 
For they are the men that were victorious.

As sung by J. II. McGuire. 
The rain and hail in torrents came 
When I 
left Lome in black October; 
The wind in thundering gales did blow, 
And I 
thought that half of the world was over. 
The reason why my colleen and I 
Fell out with me Cousin Barney ; 
So I 
bid farewell to the town of Kens, 
And came up to Dublin, to join the army. 
In Dublin city I 
soon arrived, 
And crossed the Liffey, that lovely river; 
At the castle yard a 
big blackguard 
Asked me to enlist in the Blackster Skivers. 
I 
did agree, and he gave me a 
gun , 
Which the weight,- of it soon did 
warm- me 
So I 
hired meselt, by the powers of delf, 
To go smash China along with the army. 
Oh news from ab road 
soon made 
us 
look 
sharp, 
in a 
hurry we stuck our kits together; 
To keep up each 
heart 
we 
had a 
stock of the sup, 
To keep up each neck we had a 
stock of leather. 
JIM, THE CARTER LAD SONGSTER.

We marched to sea, played Patrick's Day 
When the cries of the colleen would most alarm 
ye; 
Some thought in their minds of the girls that were 
behind, 
But I 
thought of the boys that were before our 
army. 
In a 
ship as big as a 
town we sailed, 
in every hole and corner stuffing us; 
To get out of the cold I 
got down in the hold, 
By the tarnel it wouldn't hold half enough o, 
us. 
I 
smothered to death for the want of my breath, 
And bursting with hunger, which didn't much 
charm me; 
We were ordered to land and make a 
brave stand, 
Faith you might aisy say stand to a 
hungry 
army. 
On the field of battle I 
hadn't been long, 
Before I 
wished it to be over; 
To let a 
ball pass I 
sot down on the grass, 
But I 
didn't imagine meself in clover. 
The ball I 
can tell was a 
great bombshell, 
It attacked me rear but didn't much harm me; 
When to the next charge I 
was ordered to march, 
Faith, I 
had a 
lame excuse to halt in the army. 
Unfit for service I 
got my discharge, 
Now go it, ye cripples, cries Uncle Toby; 
A 
pension I'll get, if not, I'll be let 
To go to KiImain and be a 
fogy. 
If I 
live a 
score ov years or two more, 
In fogy's hall I 
sit to warm me; 
remember the day I 
got gunpowder tea, 
When I 
went to smash China along with the 
army.

Up in that Back Room. 
As sung by J. IL McGuire. 
One day I 
was married, the truth I 
will state, 
When you've heard my sad tale you will pity my 
fate; 
My wife makes me work both morning and night, 
And she swears that I 
never do anything right. 
The first night we were married, it's the truth I 
am 
sure, 
My wife went to bed and I 
lay on the floor; 
And since I've been married, I 
must do what I 
can, 
So pity the fate of a 
poor married man, 
CHORUS. 
Who's up in that back room, boys,. 
Up in that back room; 
All among the bugs and fleas, 
Pity my sad doom. 
Up in that back room, boys, 
Up in that back room; 
I 
wish I'd ne'er got married, 
To be up in that back room. 
Every morning at five, to please her desire, 
She makes me get up and set light to the fire, 
Six months I've been married, its the truth I 
de-
clare, 
But the joys of my wedlock, I 
have not yet shared. 
Before we were married, it's true on my word, 
She looked like an angel and sung like a 
bird; 
But now like a 
lion she will fly very soon, 
If I 
speak she will quick knock me down with a 
broom. 
Up in that, etc.

And they all have to stand aside for me. 
CHORUS. 
Then shouts boys, shout and let's be jolly, 
Stand aside and let this swell go past,

short cane in my hand, •• 
For, by Jove, you see the comet's come at last,

shine, 
With this taking way of mine, 
And if in Rotten Row I 
chance to ride, 
My horse holds up his head 
As though he proudly said, 
The cornet comes, you fellows stand aside. 
Then shout, etc. 
At a 
theatre or a 
ball, 
Or at supper one and all, 
To stand aside for me they find it best, 
For my most impressive way 
Puts them down and seems to say, 
Stand aide, I 
UM the comet of the west. 
Then shout, etc. 
If by chance I'm at a 
race, 
In the stand I 
get a 
place, 
No matter what crowd or who are there, 
It will always be my pride, 
That I 
make ti.em stand aside, 
There's no resisting in 
important way. 
Then shout, etc. 
Tvery green room I 
do know, 
Behind the scenes I 
go ; 
But I 
come off better than the rest ; 
For the ballet all know me, 
And each pretty girl I 
see 
Is attracted by the comet of filo west.

Never put on airs at all or apeld the ways of men ; 
But now they call for bitter beer and in your face 
will blow 
The smoke from penny Cubas foul; oh, I 
should like

What would our parents thought of that some fifty 
years ago. 
Yes, I 
am, etc. 
At midnight too, we hear young men with nustry 
voices sing, 
Champagne Charlie is my name, and they know it's 
no such thing ; 
To hear them praise a

Wear both hats and jackets and appear quite mu-

fought

Along with Hickory Jackson, some fifty years ago. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am one of the old time, 
And may be thought too slow, 
For I 
am Jersey Sam, the farmer's man, 
Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah. 
I 
bear the name of Samuel, though some they call 
me Sam, 
And through this world I 
rove along, as happy as

When I

And each sail was set and each heart was gay.

The sunny shore of the Grecian isles, 
All thought of home, of that welcome dear 
That soon should greet each wand'rer's ear, 
And in fancy join'd the social throng, 
In the festive dance and the joyous song.

And if you've a 
morsel of pity, 
Your tears will flow down by the pail. 
It's concerning a 
damsel called Sally, 
Such a 
purty gal never was born, 
She in Baxter street lived, in an alley, 
The purty gal selling hot corn. 
Her love to one Riley was given, 
Who clams round the town peddled he, 
He used to sell fish for a 
living, 
And he was no ways selfish you see, 
But he ' listed to go for a 
soger; 
And he left his poor Sal all forlorn, 
She in Baxter street lived, in an alley, 
This purty girl selling hot corn. 
He was stationed outside of a 
city, 
Where one day picket duty he tried, 
He was bit by an orful muskeeteer, 
He swelled up, then bursted and died, 
Far away from this damsel called Sally. 
For Riley every night she would mourn; 
She in Baxter street lived, in an alley, 
This purty girl selling hot corn. 
Every morning she'd sit in the alley 
Where she used for to sigh and to sob, 
JIM, TIIE CARTER LAD SONGSTER. 
Till a

But she choked herself dead with the cob

From the windows of pleasure and plenty on earth, 
Makes me think what it is to be friendless and

And pride of all the yachting clubs that ever hailed 
from Ey

It happened on a

Where coarne she from, or who she was, not one of

For no one thought she was a

Where did von come from? New Yolk town, 
Who is your captain ? old Massa Brown. (Repeat.) 
On she came, as lightly as a 
bird upon the win', 
And rounding to quite noiselessly cast anchor in that 
ring, 
Her stern presents an eagle, spread from starboard 
side to port, 
And that was all the ornament she bore of any 
sort. 
'Twas then the royal yacht club began to smell a 
rat; 
Some:thought she was some pumpkins, sonic thought 
her more than that, 
But interchange of visits soon made it clear as day. 
she was Brother Jonathan's own America. 
Where did, etc.

challenge did in-

challenge fair, frank and bola as any man could 
write; 
tio told the noble Wilton he'd run his Yankee

Against cutters, schooners, steamers of size, he cared 
not what. 
Our regatta now being open to the yachts of all 
creat ion, 
And we're the only Yankees here to represent the 
nation, 
We've entered against fifty royal races round the 
• 
nab, 
And beat the best as easy as a 
dolphin would a 
crab. 
Where did, etc. 
This touched the raw of good John Bull and aroused 
his native pride, 
Says he, 
bet five hundred pounds I'll find a 
boat 
at Ryde, 
In sailing twenty miles and back will beat this 
Yankee doodle, 
Or I 
will plainly tell the world that I'm a 
beaten 
noodle. 
The day arrives, the queen is there to glorify the 
sigh t, 
The nobs and snobs, the yachts and yawls around 
the Isle of Wight, 
The signal's given, off we go, but need I 
tell the 
story ? 
How far behind we left John Bull rejoicing in his 
glory. 
Where did, etc. 
Now the yachting season's over and we've all had 
lots of fun, 
The cups and prizes handed to the winners that 
have won; 
Victoria frankly gives her honest approbation,

The poor old tars of England looked on with sad

And all the roosters in their coops crow Yankee

And never will my heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others thought that life was gone, 
And death would take away,

And that was Maggie May.

That I 
ere long may call her mine,

For she is all the world to me, 
Altholvzh I'm far away,

Our journey's end at last arrived, 
My heart beat slow and fast, 
While passengers ran here and there, 
My love among them passed; 
She turn'd her head and spoke to me 
In a 
voice so soft and merry, 
Saying, write a 
note to station D, 
Sign, crossing on the ferry. 
Walking through, etc.

As sung by J. II. McGuire. 
Button up your waistcoat, button up your shoes, 
Have another liquor and throw away the blues, 
Be like me, good for a 
spree, 
From now till the day is dawning ; 
For I 
am a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be a 
member of the rollicking ram ; 
The only boys to make a 
noise 
From now till the day is dawning ; 
We scorn such drink as lemonade, soda, seltzer and 
beer, 
The liquors of our club I'll tell to you, 
But I 
can't for there's ladies here ; 
Come along, come along, come, come, come along.

CHORUS. 
For I'm a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Out all night till broad daylight, 
And never go home till morning. 
For I'm a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Come and be a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
Out all night till broad daylight., • 
And never go home till morning. 
When once you're a 
member of the rollicking rams, 
All things are real, we have no shams, 
Except champagne, good champagne, 
We drink till the day is dawning, 
In all the pockets of the rollicking rams, 
Each one puts a 
bottle of clam ; 
And on some door step sit and drink till daylight 
in the morning; 
With a 
pocket full of money the police make right, 
To what we do they're blind, 
Such as pulling down bells and breaking lamps, 
For which We should be fined. 
Come along, come along, come, come, come along. 
For I'm, etc. 
The milkman in the morning he knows us rams, 
We follow up behind and empty the cans 
Which down the area he has put 
For breakfast in the morning; 
Upset a 
coffee-pot as we go borne; 
With us our landladies pick a 
bone, 
And get kicked out of house and home 
Without a 
moments warning. 
But we don't care, we're single men, not hampered 
with a 
wife, 
So now my friends if you like the style, 
JIM, THE CARTER LAD SONOSTER.

Come and spend a 
noisy life. 
Come along, come along, come, come, come along. 
For I'm, etc. 
Shan't I be glad when Sally comes 
Home. 
Sung with great success by George Melville, comic vocalist. 
Oh, I've been so sad for a 
very long time, 
I 
thought that I'd lost that girl of mine, 
Who really is an angel divine, 
And I 
have her absence been mourning. 
Oh, yes, through her I've been made very ill, 
To her ' twas a 
trouble to keep her hands still, 
And for it she's got six months on the tread- mill, 
But she's coming out in the morning. 
CH01117S. 
Oh, shan't I 
be glad when Sally conies home, 
When Sally comes home, when Sally comes home, 
Oh, shan't I 
be glad when Sally conies home, 
For she's coming home in the morning. 
Now Sa!ly she was her mother's fond pet, 
But unluckily now one day she met 
A friend of her's called Light-fingered Bet; 
A 
girl much addicted to cheating. 
They walked in a 
large dry goods store one fine day 
To Guy some nice ribbons and flowers so gay, 
'When Sally was seen walking quickly away 
• With twenty-four yards of good sheeting. 
Oh, shan't I, etc.. 
The shopman on her all the time had his eye, 
And called a 
policeman who was then standing by; 
Though Sarah she loudly for mercy did cry, 
He soon walked her off to the station.

JIM, TIM CAD.TER LAD SONGSTER. 
They took her before the judge the next day; 
A most shocking Lad case it was, he did say, 
So : or six long nYonths he sent Sally away, 
To be boarded and lodged by the nation. 
Oh, shan't I, etc. 
nrad from Eliculot 
As sung by John Nolan, ixtiladizt. 
Alone and from hmne, friendless and poor, 
How many sorrows and slights we endure, 
Anxious I 
look for one face that I 
know— 
Watching the crowd, as they pass_to and fro. 
Some look upon me with a 
sorrowful eye, 
And drop a 
kind word as they quickly pass by, 
\Vhile others bestow. 
but a 
cold glance of scorn, 
Nor pity the stranger so sad and forlorn. 
CITOLITS. 
Sadlv I 
wander by day and by night, 
\Vatchinthe moments in Time's rapid. flight, 
No one will comfort me whither I 
roam, 
A poor weary stranger, alone and from home. 
Alone and from home, weary, oppressed, 
No one to welcome me, no where to rest, 
Where may I 
pillmw my poor aching head? 
Who will weep over me when 1 
am dead ? 
The night falls around me, cheerless and still, 
The dew-drops upon me so damp and so chill, 
'fis then that I 
long for the coming of day, 
For then the dark shadows will all pass away.
