Briana O’Higgins interviewing David Dodson, former engineer at Boeing. 
 
September 25, 2012. 
 
Dave, are you from Wichita? 
 
Not Originally. 
 
Where are you from? 
 
I was born in western Kansas and I grew up in Kansas, Colorado, Texas.  
 
When you were growing up were you aware of Boeing and its presence in Wichita? 
 
Not so much until I was maybe in my teens. Uh, I went to high school over in El 
Dorado, so I was close by over here and I was aware of Boeing at that time. 
 
Do you remember sort of what you knew of Boeing, or its role in the community? 
 
Beyond it just being an airplane company at the time, I didn’t know anymore. 
 
What degrees do you hold and from what colleges or universities? 
 
Um, I’ve got a BS ME, mechanical engineering, from Kansas State. 
 
Have you had any family members that worked at Boeing? 
 
… 
 
Any family members that worked at Boeing? Or were you the only one? 
 
I believe I am, I believe I had a distant cousin that worked in the northwest, but no 
immediate family, no. 
 
When did you start work at Boeing? What was the circumstance of that first job? 
 
Well I graduated in December of 78 and uh, I had interviewed at the placement 
office at K-state, at that time there was a lot of oil industry, pipeline companies, and 
a few refineries that were looking for people. And then some aircraft companies 
came to town so, I uh, I kind of a funny story… McDonnell Douglas came to town and 
they were having free Hors d'oeuvres, and I thought oh, maybe I will go talk to them, 
and then Boeing came to town and they said they were going to have a meal, prime 
rib, free prime rib meal. And I said, well I’ll go talk to them. So from that point, I liked 
what I heard at the meal and, did an interview and did a plant trip, and then the next 
thing you know I hired on, so. I sorta showed up here because I wanted a free meal. 
Haha. 
 
So they came up to your university to recruit graduates? 
 
Yes.Yes. 
 
And you were not yet graduated yet and you heard about this free meal? 
 
Yeah. 
 
Will you kind of describe what you remember from that event? A little more what 
they were offering and what, sort of they talked about? 
 
They had brought some engineers, uh, and some recruiting people and they had us 
broke up into separate tables and maybe four or five of us at each table and they 
talked about what they did there and what we could be expect and that sort of thing. 
 
What sort of stood out from Boeing against the other offers or other companies that 
were wooing graduates that made you want to work there? 
 
They were more aggressive at the time I guess I would say, you know. Not just the 
meal, but they wanted a trip, they sent us, they were ready to have a plant visit right 
off and uh, I went and toured the plant and saw the kind of, saw the place. Since I 
was familiar with Wichita also, it uh, fairly familiar with it at the time, that helped 
too. But huh, they were just pretty aggressive in saying that they wanted new 
engineers at Boeing, they were hiring big at the time… ha…  
 
How old are you now? 
 
I am 56.  
 
So you have been working at Boeing for around 30….? 
 
 
33, and ¾ years. 
 
What was your job title at Boeing? I guess the last one. 
 
I was… yeah… I think the last one was senior engineer. 
 
And what did you start out as? 
 
I was just a, I think they started you just basically engineer. And you moved up. 
 
Will you sort of describe, I guess briefly, what your duties were. I imagine they 
changed over those 33 years. 
 
Yeah, it did quite a bit. Early on, um, when I was started I started working in systems 
area. I was hired in to do mechanism design and I started doing aircraft systems, 
fuel and hydraulic. Those sort of… air conditioning. That was for the B52 at the time, 
which was a big active program it was a, they were, that was what they were 
bringing a lot of people on, was to work on that. And uh, we did drawing, we would 
do the engineering update the drawings there, as I completed that I ended up getting 
onto the re–engine program and I got on that one pretty early. I helped put together 
some of the documentation for the requirements um, systems spec documents. And 
then we got into designing what we were going to do and at that time we were still 
doing pen and ink drawings and a bunch of us did drawings and released those. And 
spent some time out on the aircraft. The first on was here, uh, it was ih, what to do to 
make adjustments to engineering and that. Uh, on the aircraft I made adjustments to 
things, corrections and things like that. And then, so that was really the first 
program that I worked on from beginning to end uh, that was to put all the new 
CM56 engines on the 135s. And from there I went on into commercial mod area and 
did a, and we did mod work where they, well the one program that I got on the 
National Guard had bought some old airplanes, four old airplanes and converted 
them for their use to carry the troops around on. Then I moved into a program 
where I started doing lead work. Where I, I wasn’t in management but you assign 
work packages and see that the stuff gets moved along and as well as doing 
presentations and that sort of thing for the customer about what you are doing. That 
was for uh, um, joint stars which was a surveillance program. A surveillance aircraft. 
They ended up uses those in the first Gulf war to hunt scud launchers. So that is kind 
of neat. It is kind of neat to see something you did like that actually helping people 
out I guess doing that stuff. And uh, after that I did some commercial mod work um, 
it was a big special freighter program where they take older 747s that are, they 
either needed to be highly maintenanced, a lot of work done to them to get into the 
passenger use, but usually what they ended up doing was converting them to 
freighters, which is what we did. Um, to the designs to put in extra floor beams and a 
cargo door. I was still working on the systems interior side of that very heavy. And 
then when the new airplane, uh, triple 7 came in. That was the first one that was 
really done CAD. Started doing that on computers and uh..  
 
Did they train you? 
 
Yes yes. We went to training for um, three and a half weeks and then started in 
doing the program. I ended up working on the rolls Royce translating sleeve, the 
trust reverser. Then we did some parts, this one, in order to stop the aircraft when 
you land on the ground they always hit the thrust reversers and it throws you in the 
seat. What they are doing is uh, re directing some of the abs thrust forward, so you 
have this large sleeve on the engine that slides back, opens these cascades and lets 
the thrust go forward and stops ya so you don’t run off the runway. So I was doing 
some little parts of that and uh, kind of started, after that that was the introduction 
of everybody to doing an actual full up CAD program and,  
 
How was that transition for you? 
 
I liked it at the time, it was something new. You know, I was kind of tired of the old 
ink and paper stuff that always, so it was kind of neat that we were able to get into 
that. And then I got in on, later on, the next generation where they redesigned the 
737 for new engines and that was all same way, it was all done on CAD and they 
kinda have done that ever since. All CAD stuff. Every once in a while we come across 
some old uh, program where we still gotta do something, but.. that got less and less, 
and now we don’t even touch that stuff. Everything is just done. I kind of 
transitioned into, with the CAD, starting doing a lot of structures work. And uh, uh, 
that kind of was the second half of my career and that is what I am doing now at 
Spirit, I was hired in as a structures. Because I have done that.  
 
What was it sort of… did you move up over the years? Did you have agency in what 
projects you worked on? 
 
Yeah I had gotten into a lead and I was even. I had a supervisor and he was a real 
nice guy and he kind of promoted everybody that worked for him. He was one of the 
better ones that I have ever had. His name was tom Gleeson. He really promoted and 
tried to help people to move on. Not just, he wasn’t just worried about getting the 
job done. He was also um, help build the next generation of leadership out there. 
 
Was that sort of, did it sway from the norm of what was going on at the time? Was it 
hard to move up for a lot of people? 
 
Um, not so much. It depended on where you were. It was kind of circumstance and 
you know, some people are more go getters than others. Um… 
 
Kind of like you would expect? 
 
Yeah. I had. I think at that time I was up, considered for a to move into management 
and at the last minute another fellow from another areas was moved in to take over 
and I kind of had, was starting to have second thoughts about whether I really 
wanted to work my way out of engine– out of the nuts and bolts of engineering 
because I really kind of liked the hands on part of the engineering and as you move 
into management you get more into personnel and a lot of non engineering. I heard 
a quote one time, an engineer isn’t happy until he has worked his way out of his 
career, so I kind of thought I would really rather stay in the design end of things and 
that is what I have done a lot ever since. I later got into special apps area that we did 
some interesting stuff that I cant go into details about. But that was some of the 
most interesting work I ever did. We had a, since it was a smaller and uh, kind of 
proprietary and we couldn’t talk with others our group got kind of close. And some 
of the, so of the people that I have worked with over the years in that group I’m still 
close with. They came to my retirement party, that was mostly folks from that 
group. We had a pretty good experience with that. 
 
Were classified projects sort of frequent at Boeing here? 
 
Not that much. There… they always had something going on depending on what the 
customers were looking for.  
 
And you were classified from your family and everyone? Not to share details. 
 
No, these kinds of programs you don’t give details to anybody but who you are 
working with. You don’t even talk about them outside of the area. 
 
What was the most frustrating part about your job? 
 
Oh some of it is the company what so big and they, they were very bureaucratic and 
sometimes it was so hard to get anything, even the simplest thing. It would just be 
like I cannot believe the bureaucracy we have to go through just to do this, and that 
was kind of, you just had to kind of bite the bullet and say, hey well, everybody’s got 
their box to check and everybody has to tick off before we move to the next level.  
 
What was sort of,  how was Wichita Boeing painted in the larger company? It is this 
big huge company were you guys part of the larger thing, or an after thought, how 
did you feel in relationship to the larger company? 
 
Uh, Wichita was it always seemed like whenever I visit the northwest it was kind of, 
we were thought of as the cow pasture out here I guess. Hahaha. That was some of 
the attitude, but once we would work with different uh, groups or folks, and they 
would kind of start to change that attitude, but the general going in attitude was this 
was the frontier out here.  
 
Was that because of the Boeing Wichita or just Wichita? 
 
I think there was some folks, up in the, the ones I am thinking about are in the 
northwest. They, at various times over the years Wichita got certain work that might 
have otherwise gone to the northwest and I think there was a little bit of sour 
grapes on some of that. Thinking that they should be doing the work, not the 
cowboys out here in the prairie. But um, the advantage that Wichita had, it was still 
kind of small enough compared kind of to the northwest, everybody in the 
northwest is highly specialized. I mean, we have gone up there and talked to a guy 
that knows everything there is to know about putting the galley between doors 
three and four on a 747 and it is just Jamco’s galley. If there is another vendor, 
somebody else knows that. And here, um, you know, we did all the galleys. We did 
all the lavatories, I mean we, the workforce here was a lot more adept at jumping 
around and doing a lot of different things. We didn’t have the giant workforce like 
they had, it was just kind of the way you did stuff. You had to be more nimble about 
stuff.  So. 
 
Did you sort of socialize outside of Boeing? What was your social circle like when 
you were working there? 
 
Yeah initially when I hired in it was a big hiring push, so we were all new to town so 
it was kind of a group of folks that were new to town, just been here a few years and 
at that time the company still had recreation. So, we would play softball, baseball, 
soccer, we had soccer leagues.  
 
The company did? 
 
Yeah the company did and uh, we did other socializing together. Yeah, there was 
quite a few, quite a bit of socializing with folks because uh, uh, we were kind of all in 
the same circumstance. All recent, recently brought into town. There was also a lot 
of people that were hiring in that were multi–generation Boeing. You know their 
parents, one or both had worked out there. Or a cousin or a sister, so there was a lot 
of folks that had a family feel about it too. It was almost like a Boeing family, you’d 
say. 
 
What… I am interested in more about your softball teams, what after work was like. 
Especially in those early years. What did the company put on, it sounds like they 
sponsored your teams, and what sort of fashion. 
 
They had leagues. They had a ball park out there.  We also played soccer outdoors. 
There was a whole recreational um, uh, I don’t know what it was, kind of like an 
organization. We played soccer leagues uh, against each other and the company. And 
we played a lot outdoors and we went to an indoor league and it was off site, at 
some of the, at that time there was indoor soccer around town because soccer was 
real popular because of the Wings at the time. And uh, Boeing would have our 
leagues, we would play in several of those. They would set it up and we had games 
in these different soccer buildings all over town.  
 
How did that sort of fade out? Or did it stop, I’m, not even sure that is true? 
 
Yeah that all faded out. Um, well some of the old ball diamonds they would move 
them around, and the soccer fields, when they would have to build a new building. 
Originally, when I first got here there was a large pond that dated back to the 50s 
that people fished at, and then all the ball diamonds were behind it. And then they 
came in and they needed to put a big assembly plant there. So they filled that all in, 
they made some new diamonds over by the, at that time, it was the animal shelter, 
the Humane Society over there. And then, I think the Boeing employee association at 
that time went out and bought a lake on the southwest side of time, for employees. 
And it all kind of transitioned to them. But uh, it kinda faded down, partly, uh, we all 
got a little older and we started getting married and starting families and all that. So, 
kind of just changed our focus in life, that sort of thing. 
 
What sort of changes, …, what sort of major changes did you witness in how the 
company was run over your 33 years there? 
 
Well everybody points to one event that was a, a change in the way stuff was run 
and that was when the merger with McDonnell Douglas. I don’t know. That was in 
96. And uh, some people have nothing good to say about that point. A lot of the 
McDonnell Douglas management came into the company. I don’t know it it was a… 
there was definitely a change in the direction. Not that maybe the Boeing company 
wasn’t already going in that direction anyway, it accelerated a little bit. And we 
started being, hearing a lot of stuff like we’re a team, we aren’t a family. And kind of 
building the idea that we are a team to build, uh, we should have kind of a team 
attitude, working as teams. There was that before, but it kind of intensified after 
that, and then, of course, with all the mergers of the two companies they started 
being in a scramble between the two plants over who was going to get what 
programs and all that. And uh, I don’t know if I just didn’t notice it before, but it 
seemed like there needed to be, advocates for your site. Higher up in management. 
And um, some sites had very strong advocates and they got a lot of work, and some 
didn’t.  
 
It felt like it was … less equitable? 
 
Yeah, it was more, yeah, internal competition seemed to ramp up at that point, 
because you had. Well you had that, and they had purchased from Rockwell, the 
North American and rocketine parts too. So suddenly the company just got huge. It 
like doubled in size and a lot of the different sites were doing the same things. 
Duplicates, and everyone knew that that wasn’t going to last long. And um. That was 
just kind of the starts of trimming down. 
 
What was the atmosphere then? Was everyone scared. 
 
Oh, they had, we had been through a big down sizing right before that, that was 
when down sizing was the big thing, so um, the uh, workload of everybody kind of 
changed and we all were picking up the slack and everybody from that point on was 
working a lot.. I was doing more then what they used to do before that I mean. We 
had to do more with less and that just kind of seemed to be the whole attitude here 
in Wichita from then on, and just ramped up from there, to uh, you know, that we 
had to get by, we had to cut our rates, we had to do this we had to make sure 
everything was kind of a, uh, like some kind of an intense ball team I guess.  
 
Over your years of employment there what did you feel, did you feel like an 
allegiance to the company? Did that change? Did you at one time have a strong bond 
with it and then maybe at some other times not so much? 
 
Maybe up and down, but I guess over the years I felt like it was everything that 
Boeing did, or that I did for Boeing was some way reflecting on me, so um I felt 
somewhat of an allegiance to it, yeah. 
 
Did you feel like the company valued you as a worker throughout all those years and 
cared about you and provided what you needed? 
 
Probably all right. I was up and down on that. Sometimes I was very high on that 
and sometimes it was like, I’m not so sure they are. Haha. 
 
Was it sort of always up and down, or was it up or down over a course of years? 
 
Uh, the last 10 years it has kind of been sliding down. At that point it seemed like a 
lot of stuff that we used to do here suddenly we weren’t able to do this kind of work 
anymore and that kind of work and they were, every time we would do a new 
project it was like you know, there was one project there I was on at the shop and 
they were wanting us to make some large placards to stick on them. We had done 
the engineering to just stencil them, and I went over there and I said why are we 
doing this? Why don’t we just stencil it on there? And they said, they don’t keep the 
stencil stuff around anymore, they sold off those tools, so, now to mark that we need 
to make placards. And it was like, OK, now I understand. And just capabilities just 
kept disappearing as they, you know they were trying to do efficiencies I guess, 
somebody had put numbers to it and decided this machine sitting around half the 
time making stencils, so they just go buy a stencil or pay somebody to go build some 
placards, and um, that sort of thing. So it just kinda slowly coasted in, I mean. Um, 
when they were getting ready to sell Spirit to Spirit, you know, the commercial side, 
it just didn’t seem like they were out chasing work like they used to for the 
commercial. It was just kinda waiting there to be sold, and when they did everybody 
kind of had the attitude– we are going to be gone in five years. It just kind of slowly 
trickled down and it was like well, I guess it wasn’t five it was seven. But essentially 
that’s what happened. 
 
So you felt it coming? 
 
Yeah, I mean. Yeah. You could see it all the time that it was less and less you even felt 
obliged to scramble a bit more or do stuff outside your, your comfort area, or just do 
stuff you know, start doing stuff that used to be done by planners. Or, even to help 
out a vendor who was having trouble with inspection. Uh, they sent several of us 
with a reverse engineering tool to help and inspect parts to help get stuff along. So, 
kinda just started doing more and more. Which was kinda good for us, but it meant 
um, that we were really scrambling more and more to keep work going, programs 
going here. 
 
Are you saying they were trying to… 
 
I think everybody starting trying push the, you know, and here toward the end the 
folks that were left were the ones who usually gave 110 percent all the time and 
they were trying to push that.  
 
To save the company..? 
 
To keep things going, yeah. There were some people that had a well, seemed like 
they had a shock when this happened, I mean they were literally shocked. I… I was 
surprised at it, I mean I was surprised at the timing of it, but I wasn’t um, surprised 
that it happened.  
 
Will you describe to me what you were doing, that day, the day that you heard. Do 
you remember what was going on? 
 
It was right before thanksgiving. Uh, I think it was just a regular day and we were 
getting ready for the thanksgiving holiday in a couple of days and we heard the 
announcement that they may be considering closing the place. You know I don’t 
even remember. You would think I would, but I don’t. I think it had gotten out in the 
news media and the company they have a lot of internal news stuff, and I think they 
sent it around, there may have been an email, I cant recall. But I had never heard 
anything, we’ve heard lots of rumors and everything, but that was kinda, I just had a 
bad feeling when I heard that. I was like, we have never heard this before.  
That is when I started updating my resume and sent it out.  
 
Did you know right at that moment that you wouldn’t want to move with them if 
they gave you the opportunity? 
 
No, in fact I did receive an offer, what they call a second round offer to go to OKC and 
do some work, and my wife and I we went down there and we looked around at the 
facility a little bit and Oklahoma city I really hadn’t been down there that much 
other than just driving through. So, kinda looked around. Um, had I not had another 
offer I would probably be packing to move to Oklahoma City because it wasn’t, I 
wasn’t totally against moving. But, I don’t know that that was the most 
advantageous thing for me.  
 
What was the reaction from your colleagues, and your family I guess. 
 
Um, some of my, my parents, they are still alive and in Emporia. They were fairly 
upset,  they weren’t happy about that. Co–workers, most people kind of went 
through those phases, kinda disbelief then anger, a little bit over it. Then kinda 
acceptance I guess.  
 
Um… Boeing… 
 
Yeah, in a way it is kinda like a death in the family in one way. Cuz I didn’t realize, 
but I spent more time working out there than I have done anything else in my life. 
Its like, kinda a big deal.  
 
How do you feel about it now? Leaving that job? 
 
Well I am OK with it. Because it has worked out fairly well with me, but I guess I 
made my peace with it. I had considered before all this that, as I had reached early 
retirement age at 55, that it…. Uh, if I was able to get another position somewhere 
and start collecting my early pension at the same time then it would be a big 
financial gain for me, so uh, I talked about it and after I turned 55 I sent a couple 
resumes out, but the economy really wasn’t uh, doing so well at that point and I just 
got some thanks but no thanks return. And then uh, I was told I would be going over 
to work on the Usef Tanker, and I thought, well that will keep me employed here for 
a little while, so I will go do that. Haha. Turns out that wasn’t the case. So I had kind 
of thought about doing this anyway. Retiring and then going somewhere else. So, 
whenever they uh, said that they were going to close the place, I thought I need to do 
that. And now. So. Uh, that’s what I pursued.  
 
You said you had a retirement party? 
 
Yes I did. Last week. Yeah, it is kinda a shame, I know a lot of people that are left out 
there that I worked with for years, and in the past they have had retirement parties, 
uh, at Boeing. Or, at, folks would be able to come in maybe do it in a lobby or in a 
conference room somewhere. Or offsite, but after, but as they close the place, at least 
it seems to me at least a lot of people are retiring and leaving. Or they have 
something very small that is almost kind of uh, like quietly going off and leaving and 
it seemed like after 33 years uh, I would at least be able to do something to 
recognize that. And one of my friends was telling me that you don’t just run off. So 
my wife organized a small party. We had it over at the Kansas Aviation Museum and 
um, so folks come by after work and, it was pretty good. It was good seeing some 
folks before I left.  
 
Last weekend? 
 
Well Actually it was in the middle of the week. But yeah.  
 
What was your impression of Boeing as a contributor to Wichita? Did you feel like 
that contributed to the Wichita community? 
 
Oh I think they did. Not just in being the biggest employer. Um, the company tried to 
do a lot of community stuff. They were always bagging uh, uh, lots of different non–
profit events. There was always a Boeing sponsorship and I thought there was 
always a lot of uh, they really tried to keep community involvement and filter money 
and help. There was always, uh, oh drives out there for uh, backpacks for kids at 
Christmas and coat drives and food drives. And they used to organize that in the 
shop a lot of folks uh, get together and build toys. There was just all kinds of 
different activities. And then they were still up until now looking for volunteers to 
help at the Lords Diner to help serve food and that sort of thing. 
 
So those activities continued through 2011 at least? 
 
I think it is going to be a shame that Boeing is not going to be here to help support all 
that stuff. Because not just the economics they did a lot of other support in activities 
in town that I don’t know that it would fully be picked up by other companies here. 
 
Um, I know you have only been at spirit for like three days, but… 
 
This was my third day today, Haha. 
 
What difference, if any, can you pinpoint now? 
 
Well um, I noticed right off at my first day at orientation that was about thirty five 
forty of us new hires coming in, and I thought wow this place is still growing I guess. 
But I want to say, I, we, kind of got used to not seeing new people over at Boeing. It 
was just the same old group all the time. And kinda the attitude, in just what little 
time I have been there, it feels more upbeat, like you know, … I guess there is a 
future here, there is things  going to be happening we are going to do stuff. Um, it 
kinda has, I guess just an upbeat feeling more. Um, Boeing over the years, and you 
just didn’t notice it until you got away from it that it kinda, you just kinda slid down 
into a… holding on. Just holding on type of attitude. And Spirit doesn’t seem, it seems 
to be still on a more upbeat.  
 
Did any of your colleagues get hired at Spirit? 
 
Yes, some of them have in fact I saw one of them yesterday. I saw his name on the 
chart so I shot him an email and said, hey I am over here now. I am sitting here. So 
he came over and said HI.  
 
That’s nice. 
 
Yeah.  
 
What… Do you think Boeing leaving the Wichita community will hurt the 
community?  We talked about them losing the philanthropies already… or how do 
you think Wichita is going to change? I know it is a big question. 
 
Well they had a lot of reach I guess, outside of Kansas., outside of US because of you 
know connections with selling overseas and a lot of uh. Well, on the defense side 
with the different plants, there was always a lot of news reported about Boeing. 
Selling this many airplanes or getting this contract or that contract. Even if it didn’t 
actually do something here. It may have. I guess a lot of that connection to that has 
kind of diminished. So. And then the other thing is, ha, there is not money coming 
into the community. Yeah. That was that was outside coming into Kansas. Coming 
into Wichita that is not going to be there. 
 
Um what would you personally, sort of, what do you think you will think about 
Boeing like 10, 15, 20 years from now when you look back on your experience 
there? 
 
I think I uh, pretty much positive all the way. I mean, they’ve. They’ve provided a 
good life for me and my family, and uh, a lot of  people I know for them and their 
families. So a lof of us wouldn’t be as well off as we are now. So. Uh. They’ve helped 
grow me, all the training and everything that I am using now, I was provided by 
them. I mean, you know, I went to, I had the engineering degree, but a lot of the stuff 
that we use now in, was on the job training. And, it just was partially from 
experience, partially from actual training. And that, so. I guess they made a lot of 
what I am now. Economically, hahaha. 
 
How do you hope the greater Wichita community looks back on Boeing? Tomorrow, 
today, 10 years from now? 
 
…. 
 
Because right now there is a little animosity I guess you could say. 
 
Yeah. That’s understandable. There is a lot of animosity inside of Boeing still. But 
most of us have kind of moved on from that. Maybe, hopefully, well I hope it is 
positive. But, I am not really sure how people will feel if… if Wichita, you know has 
problems down the road, economically Boeing may get blamed and maybe rightfully 
so. I don’t know so. It kind of depends on how things go. It might be kinda just 
glossed over, but it could end up being the one to point at– this was the start of 
everything bad.  
 
Do you have a lot of co–workers, colleagues that are looking for work, or are 
expecting to be unemployed come January? 
 
Yeah there is quite a few. Um, were I was at in tanker there is quite a few folks I 
know that middle of next month they are going to be laid off and unfortunately they 
are very good at what they do, but nobody is hiring those skills right now. And you 
you, and even though they are at the top of their game, nobody is looking for those 
kinds of skills. They are just out the door. I really feel bad about that. But I mean, I 
have been real fortunate to come to a new job and be able to retire and all this, and 
uh. Sometimes I feel funny talking about that to people I know because I know that 
they are not as fortunate. It is not looking as good for them.  
 
Do you think that Wichita has a strong aviation future? I know you said you thought 
it looks that way at Spirit… 
 
I…. I have a little more confidence in it now. I know that Spirit’s doing really well. 
Airbus as been really talking a lot about wanting to commit more to Wichita and the 
aviation around here. And hopefully, I don’t even know what is going on at Hawker 
Beech, but hopefully whatever is going on over there gets settled out and hopefully 
that will come back strong too. So, I think there is a good chance that aircraft could 
bounce back here.  
 
That is probably about it for me, unless you think there is something about your 
experience that um, I should have asked you about. 
 
I think you hit all the high points. I truly hope that it gets better because I am still 
part of the community here, we’ve committed to stay here, and I don’t want to see it 
go down.  
 
Did you think about that when you decided to stay here? 
 
Actually we did. Lisa and I discussed this quite a bit. It was like, is this town, um, 
becoming another part of the rust belt? Maybe is this the time to get out of here? We 
had those discussions.  
 
And the answer is still not clear? 
 
Yeah, it looked like it was a good bet to stay here. 
 
Are you attached to Wichita now? 
 
Yeah this has been my home for over 33 years. I have lived here longer than I have 
lived anywhere else. So, yeah. Although it is funny, somebody asked me, you’re from 
Wichita? No, I moved here to go to work. I mean I have lived here longer than 
anywhere else, but I guess you still have that, well I came from somewhere else.  
 
You weren’t born here…  
 
Yeah the ones that were born and raised here, they really feel the ownership, this is, 
that they are Wichitans.
