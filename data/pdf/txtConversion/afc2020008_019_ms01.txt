Sue Hess interviewed by Vyta Pivo on May 26, 2021 at the Lehigh Cement Company Plant in 
Evansville, Pennsylvania. The interview transcript has been edited for clarity.  
 
[00:00:00] 
 
Vyta Pivo: Today is Wednesday, May 26th, 2021. This is an interview for the occupational 
history archive, which is part of the Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, funded by the 
Archie Green Fellowship. As part of this project, I'm interviewing cement workers in the 
Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of the modern cement industry in the United 
States. The recording and transcript will become part of the permanent collection at the Library 
of Congress. I am Vyta Pivo and today I am speaking with Sue Hess here at the Lehigh Cement 
Company Plant in Evansville, Pennsylvania. And just to confirm, you give me your permission 
to record the interview, is that correct?  
 
Sue Hess:  
Yes.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much. Uh, could you tell me your full name, your year of birth and where 
you were born?  
 
SH: 
Susan Lynn Hess, 1971, Redding, Pennsylvania.  
 
VP: 
And this is nearby, just around the corner?  
 
SH: 
Yes, yes.  
 
VP: 
So, is that where you grew up?  
 
SH: 
Um, well, when I say Redding, that's the hospital that I was born at. I grew up down in 
Muhlenberg Township. It's only a couple miles from here. I lived there my whole life.  
 
VP: 
Are you still living there?  
 
SH: 
I lived there my life until I got married.  
 
VP: 
And did you move to somewhere nearby?  
 
SH: 
Yes. I live in Blandin, which is five minutes from here, and I love it. I like the quick 
drive to work.  
 
VP: 
So, when did you first learn about cement?  
 
[00:01:40] 
 
SH: 
Well, I was born into it—my father worked here. Um, so growing up, all I knew is my 
dad worked at a cement plant and he worked hard and he would come home from work and I 
would go running out to the car and carry his lunchbox in. And he'd always sit down and he'd 
tell my mom and my brothers and sisters, you know, some parts of his day. And every year 
they would have this company picnic at a Mayor’s Grove over in Blandin. And we would 
2 
 
always go. So, like I got to know a lot of my dad's friends, you know, kids of people that 
worked here. And they did a tour, a family day tour or something like that when my dad still 
worked here and he was adamant about all of us coming so we could see, experience where he 
worked. He was always very proud of where he worked. So, I mean, I've known it my whole 
life.  
 
VP: 
So, what was your experience of the plant?  
 
SH: 
I was curious, I was intrigued because it's so big, like, you know what I mean? When 
you, when your dad's saying, oh, I'm going to work, some dads go office building, some go, 
you know, my mom was a secretary. So, when I came here, I was like, wow, it's so big. And it 
was interesting. And like, my dad would always talk about different things here. And I never 
understood how you make cement. And I still, even for how many years I'm here, I don't fully 
grasp the whole from start to finish. But yeah, I was always interested.  
 
VP: 
So, what did your dad do at the plant?  
 
SH: 
My dad, he was all over the place. At one time he was a truck driver, but his proudest 
job was a welder and he was a welder until he retired in 1992.  
 
VP: 
And when did you start working in the industry?  
 
[00:04:18] 
 
SH: 
I graduated high school in 1989. The following year I went to business school because 
I wanted to be a medical secretary. Well, that summer, so it was summer of 1990, my dad’s 
like, oh I think, I think they're looking for, you know, college kids or, you know, summer help. 
So, he came in and said to the HR guy, hey, my daughter is looking for a job. Can she come up 
here and work for the summer? And the guy said, yeah, sure. I never interviewed nothing. He's 
like, tell her to come in on Monday. I came here and I never left. Because I, that summer, I did 
like just odd end jobs, I was in the sales department answering phones, then somebody left in 
the accounting department, so I filled for her. Then, they were running a new payroll system. 
So, I did that and I just loved it, I loved this job and I still do, you know? So, yeah, I never … 
I did go back to college because I was only working here, I think two days a week at one point, 
and then I would go to college three days, and just as time was going on, I lost interest in the 
medical secretary thing. I really enjoyed payroll. And, they, in 1991, November of 1991, they 
put me on the full-time payroll.  
 
VP: 
And so, is that what you've been doing throughout your career?  
 
SH: 
Mhm.  
 
VP: 
And what's your actual title now? 
 
SH: 
Plant administrator.  
 
VP: 
What do you like about this job?  
 
SH: 
I like, definitely, I like the people. This is a very family-oriented place, I can tell you 
my whole family history of people that work here. I like the nature of the job, like every day is 
3 
 
different, it's not monotonous, ugh, we got to do this again, like, it's just different every day. 
And they've been good to me. I mean, this place is the reason I was raised the way I was, I got 
things that I did. Now I'm raising my children, this place is helping. My husband works here. 
So, this is, this is our life. We, I'm thankful that we always had this job. Good money, good 
benefits, good people.  
 
VP: 
What does your husband do?  
 
SH: 
My husband is in the electrical department. He's a union employee.  
 
VP: 
And did you meet at the plant?  
 
[00:07:29] 
 
SH: 
Yes. Well, his dad works here, too, I'm telling you. So, his dad and my dad were friends, 
so I remember, my husband's name is Ronnie, I remember Ronnie from when I was younger 
at these picnics. And I know that, like him and his family would come to our house for picnics. 
And, you know, I just have been around my dad's coworkers we like family, you know what I 
mean? So, he started working here soon after I did. And we would talk here and there, but it 
wasn't anything dramatic. But like a year or two later, then we just found interest in each other 
and started dating and were married, 25 years in September.  
 
VP: 
Congratulations! 
 
SH: 
Thank you.  
 
VP: 
Is that common, would you say or not very common to meet your spouse and sort of …  
 
SH: 
Oh, I think it's very uncommon. Like, when I tell people that I work with my husband, 
they're like, what? And honestly, it's difficult. Well, not difficult. It's weird because I'm a 
salaried employee and he's a union employee. But when we first started dating and when we 
decided to get married and stuff like everyone here knows that we're committed to this place, 
like I'm not going to go home and tell him something that he shouldn't know, you know what 
I mean? Like, we know where the line is drawn and we don't let it affect us here. When we're 
here, we're just coworkers. It's not like we're meeting in the lunchroom to have lunch together 
or anything like that, you know? But, and I and I think because we've worked here for so long, 
he's here 30 years, I'm going to be here 30 years in November. And we have such a history of 
his dad worked here, his grandfather, both of his grandfathers worked here, he has cousins that 
work here. My brother works here, my nephew works here, my son is starting next week as 
summer college help. Yeah. So yeah, I just feel like it's a family. I mean there's been a lot of 
changes over the years, don't get me wrong, a lot of new faces and stuff like that. But I've 
always felt like my coworkers were my family.  
 
VP: 
So, what are some of the changes?  
 
SH: 
Well, when I started here, it was Allentown Cement. So, when Heidelberg bought us, 
then Lehigh. So, our name changed, you know, we went from being a small cement mill to 
however many employees Lehigh Hansen has, I don't know. Um, as far as my department, it's 
myself, Mike Jeblonsky and Lloyd Lutz. And we've all been together for 30 years. Lloyd and 
Mike are there longer than me. So, that aspect of it did not change. But just plant manager, I've 
4 
 
seen a lot of plant managers, um, just a lot of changes. I mean, look what we're doing now 
sitting here with masks. This past year I was working from home and I loved it. But it's, the 
industry didn't change, it was basically people, you know, and each plant manager has a 
different way of running things, but I got along with all of them. I've never had a period of time 
of working here that I was like, I'm done, I'm going to go look for another job.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned there's kind of a line between the union and non-union workers. Can 
you talk a little bit about what that means?  
 
[00:11:53] 
 
SH: 
Well, a union, unions can be tough because everything's under contract. So, you have 
to know that you know their contract and they renegotiate it every four years. And as a salaried 
employee, like we get paid when we're not here, union employees don't, they get paid overtime, 
we don't. So, like, those different things. And as long as I've worked here, there's always, we've 
always had a good relationship, like our plant manager and HR have always had a good 
relationship with the union. But I'm sure that there's been rifts at some point. I know when my 
dad worked here, it was in 1985, the union went on strike because they couldn't come to an 
agreement with the company. So, I mean, some people put a bigger line in between, but I don't 
feel that way, like, I feel like we're all here working for the same company. But I think other, 
there's other Lehigh plants that don't have unions at their plant. It's just a different … look, you 
can't just go up to them and fire somebody, like you have to go through all the steps and then 
they have, always have somebody backing them up. Where with salaried, today could be your 
last day at work.  
 
VP: 
Is that kind of challenging to work with since your husband is part of the union?  
 
SH: 
No, because we've, I mean, my husband was the vice president of the union at one time. 
We've just always knew when we were married, when we were at work. And yes, we'll go 
home from work and, believe me, my kids would tell you, my gosh, they talk about the cement. 
But my dad, my dad's deceased now, but my father-in-law, like when you figure family 
gatherings, half of us work together. So, of course, you're going to chit chat. But I just feel like 
we've always been very professional, like it wasn't deceitful or any, like we've been very 
professional with it and, knock on wood, it's never been an issue.  
 
VP: 
So, when you talk about cement at home, what do you discuss?  
 
SH: 
Well, like, he'll tell me, oh, I was working at this job today and we were having 
problems trying to figure it out, you know, like he'll tell me where he was at in the plant. It's 
sort of like my dad used to do. My dad would come home and, like, tell us about his day. And 
I couldn't understand, like he's telling me always up the kill. And I'm like, I don't know what 
he's doing, I don't know what he's talking about. Now, I have a better understanding, obviously, 
but yeah. I mean, we just talk about this our day. Like today, I'll go home and tell him about 
this, you know what I mean, but we're not talking about it all night long. Like, I think maybe 
when we were younger, we talked about it more. But now it's like our kids are older and we're 
busier now than ever and we're just very grateful to have the jobs that we have. I've seen a lot 
of people, friends, classmates, lose jobs, lose benefits laid off with this whole thing. We were 
very fortunate that we weren't affected by it. I mean, I worked from home, which … one other 
thing that I like about this place is the flexibility. With me living so close and having children, 
I'd have to leave during the day to take my daughter to an appointment or if one of my kids was 
5 
 
sick, my boss has always been very generous with that, and I'm very thankful for that, I mean, 
and to this day, Noelle, any of them, they're very considerate of you have a family, that comes 
first. And I feel like some places don't give you that opportunity, you know what I mean? So, 
I'm very grateful to work here, I really am.  
 
VP: 
Have you ever considered working outside of the administration and maybe going into 
the plant or doing some other work?  
 
[00:16:37] 
 
SH: 
No, I honestly never. The only job that I somewhat considered was before Noelle came, 
that opening. A couple of people even said to me, oh, you should go for that. And I said, no, I 
like what I do. I don't know the HR side, yeah, I could learn it, but I like what I do.  
 
VP: 
What do you like about it?  
 
SH: 
I just like the flexibility and, like, I'm working with the computer sometimes. 
Sometimes I'm working on paperwork. I do the counting part of like our raw material 
purchases. It's just something different every day. Like, yeah, I do some of the same things 
every day, but every day is different. I don't know, I just can't imagine doing anything else. I've 
never had interest in working my way up the ladder. I've never had that interest, I've never had 
interest in going out in the plant. Heck no, It's too dirty and I can't wear a hard hat. Yeah.  
 
VP: 
What are the sort of, it's a very, it seems like a very masculine industry.  
 
SH: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
And has that changed over time? Like, why do you think women don't go into cement 
work as much?  
 
[00:18:01] 
 
SH: 
Um, that's a good question. We do have one girl, woman that works out in the plant. 
I'm not um, a women, you know, should be able to do everything the guy can do. I, you know, 
whatever. I just think it's physically, I don't think I could do it. Um, so I feel like, yeah, there 
is the majority of the people we work with are men. But like Noelle, she was the first female 
that we had in her at HR level. And that was nice. And I remember sitting in the interview and 
they said, you know, that this is a mostly men that work here. You’re not, would you be 
intimidated? She's like, no. And honestly, there's. I think that there is room for change. I do 
think that maybe in the future more women would go into it. I just don't know, I think we'd be 
open to it, we're not prejudiced. Oh, no, we can't have any women work, because I think we 
had a quarry manager that was a woman, too, at one time. I just don't, I would never see myself 
out there.  
 
VP: 
And is it the noise or the dust that bothers you?  
 
SH: 
Yeah. Like, just shoveling and the physical aspect of it. I don't think I could do it as a 
woman. Yes. Are there women that could do it? Absolutely. I'm going to be 50 this year. I don't 
need to be shoveling and …  
 
6 
 
VP: 
Could you talk a little bit about the work conditions, you mostly work in the office, but 
you’re still surrounded by dust and the sound.   
 
[00:20:14] 
 
SH: 
That doesn't bother me at all.  
 
VP: 
And you must be so used to it because you grew up with it.  
 
SH: 
Yeah. Yeah. No, it does bother me at all. The dust, yeah, sometimes, I'll go out and my 
car will be coated but then again our cars will be coated with pollen right now. So no, like the 
dust and I mean I know there's, we're very good environmentally to keep our neighbors happy 
and we abide by all the rules, but it's never bothered me.  
 
VP: 
Do you get to go out into the plant much?  
 
SH: 
I used to. Now, with this Covid, I haven't been down there, but we used to have like 
monthly meetings and washhouse and yeah, I would go down. I like to go down sometimes at 
lunch just to shoot the breeze with some of the guys, but I haven't gone down. 
 
VP: 
And so, do they have lunch at the same time so you can join them? 
 
SH: 
Yeah. Again, that's changed here with this because we can't have as many people in the 
lunchroom. But yeah, I have a very I would hope to say a very good relationship with the union 
and a lot of them on a personal level. I'm friends with them, but we just have never let that 
come between us.  
 
VP: 
Do you remember what living around the plant was like when you were a kid?  
 
SH: 
Um, well, no, because I was probably like five, six to five, ten miles away. Like, I didn't 
live around this plant so I wouldn't come up here unless my dad would bring me, you know, 
sometimes he would just bring me to drive by so I could see what was going on. But living 
where I live now, I mean, I can see sometimes the smoke coming out of the stacks. It doesn't 
bother me, I'm happy to, this place generates a lot of business for Fleetwood surrounding area.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned everyone is kind of like family or friends. Uh, what are some of the 
ways that folks like build community of workers?  
 
[00:22:48] 
 
SH: 
Oh, again, so much has changed over this past year. But like, just we used to go out 
after work on a Friday, down to the golf course and just have a few drinks at the end of the 
week. We used to have Christmas parties, um, toy drives, we do a lot for the community and 
that brings us together.  
 
VP: 
Has that changed over time?  
 
SH: 
Just this past year  
 
VP: 
But like, the company's involvement with the community?  
7 
 
 
SH: 
Oh, yeah, that's increased, definitely. Lehigh really does push for community 
involvement. We did a cleanup on Evansville Road and Maning Creek Road for many years. 
We pick a day to go out there and pick up trash. I feel like we, yeah, there are some neighbors 
that probably don't like us, but we try to be respectful and considerate of … when we have a 
quarry shop. We'll call people that live around here. I have a list of names of people to call just 
to give them a heads up. Hey, there's going to be quarry shot at eleven o'clock today, so be 
aware of it, not scared off their house shakes or something.  
 
VP: 
And how often are those?  
 
SH: 
I'd say like at least once a month, we have a quarry shot.  
 
VP: 
Yeah, and it's just for how long?  
 
SH: 
A period of two seconds, you feel a little bit of a rumble. That's it.  
 
VP: 
And so, this is just to get the limestone rock.  
 
SH: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
And so, uh, I mean, some of the work is dangerous, especially at the plant. Did you ever 
feel or discourage your kids or family from entering the industry?  
 
[00:24:39] 
 
SH: 
It's funny you say that because with my son starting here, I keep saying to him, Jake, 
this, people can get hurt. I've seen it, I've heard about it. You have to be aware of your 
surroundings. And they go through very specific training and stuff like that. But, yeah, I mean, 
my husband's gotten hurt here already. I guess I worry about my son because he's 19 and, you 
know. I would never discourage him, like if he, he's coming here this summer, he's in college, 
but if he'd say, hey, I'd like to work there, I wouldn't push him out of it. You know, it's a good 
place to work.  
 
VP: 
And so, you mentioned your husband has gotten hurt—what happened to him?  
 
SH: 
He got stitches, I think a piece of metal cut him at the eye. I mean, there's a lot of near 
misses, they call it. But, yes, it is dangerous. And again, that would be another reason why I 
wouldn’t want to work out there, because you know what? I don't need like, I'm perfectly 
content going into my air-conditioned office, put it that way.  
 
VP: 
And so what's your son’s feeling about going into the industry?  
 
SH: 
He's actually excited. You know, we would joke with him like last year and stuff. Oh, 
I hope that they hire summer help because you're coming over and he's like no, no, I don't want 
to work there. And then this year he was all gung ho, and he's thrilled, he's excited, he's thrilled. 
And he knows a lot of people. So, I feel like it's going to be a good learning experience for him, 
for a 19 year old. He knows that his mom and dad work hard, but now he can see what my 
husband is doing, you know what I mean, and appreciate our jobs and what we do.  
 
8 
 
VP: 
That's how you see it. How does he see this work?  
 
SH: 
Um, well, he sees the money, but yeah. I mean, he's excited to do, he's very, he plays 
baseball, so he's very concerned about working out and stuff like that. So, he thinks like, oh, 
this will be great work out, you know what I mean, shoveling and whatever. We'll see how he 
feels after two weeks here, I don't know, maybe I'll be discouraged.  
 
VP: 
So, what kind of work is he going to be doing?  
 
SH: 
Just labor work, like shoveling dirt, shoveling piles of cement, I don't know. I'm 
thinking that's what he's doing, like sweeping. There's a lot of cleanup, obviously.  
 
VP: 
How does your husband feel about him?  
 
SH: 
He's excited.  
 
VP: 
How is he going to be involved in supervising him at all?  
 
SH: 
No, no. I mean, they'll cross paths, but I don't think that they’ll work together. Well, 
there's only like eight electricians and they pretty much only go to, I mean, there's only so many 
places that they get involved in and stuff. So, yeah, I don't, I don't think they'll work together, 
maybe in the same area at some time, I don't know. 
 
VP: 
Maybe have lunch? 
 
SH: 
Yeah.  
 
VP: 
Is your son nervous about sort of having to meet a kind of higher expectation because 
everyone knows you.  
 
SH: 
Um, I'm sure because, I've said it numerous times, you know, you're going to work. I 
don't want you going there and thinking this is an easy ride. I was raised and so was my husband 
raised in that, you go to work every day and I see sometimes the younger generation is a little 
different. So, yeah, he'll be going to work every day.  
 
VP: 
What do you think, how are the younger generations different? 
 
[00:28:44] 
 
SH: 
I think. Like, the way my husband was raised, he was outside helping his dad mow 
grass, change oil. Now, I feel like kids are just so caught up in their phones and social media 
and they just don't do the things that we did as kids. And I don't know if they feel like they're 
entitled to more, I don't know. Like, I often say this, too, when I started here, I had so much 
respect for the older generation here because there was so much knowledge. These guys worked 
their butts off, they didn't have the technology that we have today. So, we, I respected that, 
same with my husband. He's like, I learned as much as I could from these older, the older 
generation. And you didn't try to take charge, you listened. Now, I feel like kids start, and I say 
kids, you know, they'll start here and like a couple of months into it, they think they know it 
all. And that's, I feel like in this industry, you're always learning. You're not going to know at 
all. You just started working here. I'm sure there's things that guys, something new every day, 
9 
 
you know what I mean? And I just feel like there should be more respect for the older, I mean, 
my father-in-law is here almost 54 years and he has no intention, like he loves coming to work. 
He's in good health, but he gets asked all the time like from other guys, when are you retiring, 
when are you retiring. He was like, I'll retire when I'm ready. Right now I don't want to, I like 
coming to work.  
 
VP: 
What does he do at the plant?  
 
SH: 
He drives a payloader. So, it's not as physical, but I mean, you're operating heavy 
equipment. You need to be paying attention, you know. So, like I said, he loves it. And that's 
something to be proud of, because you know what? It seems like people don't stay at jobs very 
long, people job jump from job to job. We have a lot of employees here that have a long history 
here. And that speaks for volumes for the industry, too, I think.  
 
VP: 
Why do you think they stay here for so long or stay in the industry?  
 
SH: 
I just feel like they enjoy it and they can make a good living and they're not pushed out 
like some jobs, people get laid off and stuff like that. I think we had one little layoff in all the 
years I'm here and it was for like two weeks. It's just, it's a consistent employment where some 
places aren't.  
 
VP: 
Do you think that's going to change as this younger generation is becoming a dominant 
workforce?  
 
SH: 
Um, I'm afraid it might. But another good thing, though, with the younger generation is 
we do have a lot of younger guys, so if they learn what they can, they have a good future here. 
We've had some start fresh out of high school. So, they're going to learn and hopefully work 
here all these years to pass on to the next generation.  
 
VP: 
Do you think that because so many of the workers have family working in the plant or 
in the industry in the area, that’s kind of additional motivation for folks to join?  
 
SH: 
Yes, yes. Because they have always tended to hire a family member before someone 
off the street, you know what I mean? And I don't know that it's like that at all the cement 
plants, I think there's more of a generation thing at these cement plants, more so than, you 
know, working at Giant or, I don't know, anywhere. But, yeah, I think it's a good thing because 
I think it gives accountability when you have, you know, relatives working in the same place.  
 
VP: 
Do you feel like that maybe also prevents newcomers to join the workforce since it is 
such a family business?  
 
SH: 
Well, no, because we have plenty of people here that aren't related to anybody. So, I 
feel like we're fair with that. Like we're not just, oh, let's hire all these kids of all of our 
employees. We have a diverse group.  
 
VP: 
Someone mentioned that the family connection, it's sort of like you can't talk badly 
about someone or you have to really think, what you’re saying.  
 
SH: 
Oh, yeah. My dad told me that before I started here. He goes, never talk bad about 
somebody because you don't know who's related to him. And that's so true because there's a lot 
10 
 
of connections here that are intertwined. So, yeah, that's a standing joke. And I know my son 
will get harassed and picked on, you know, just jokingly, not in a mean way. But they like to 
kid around, you know what I mean, that there's a lot of good people that work here, a lot of 
good people.  
 
VP: 
Does working with family also kind of make the job a little more difficult. Or do you 
at all sort of, um, uh, in some cases it can be, right?  
 
SH: 
Yeah, no, I, I've never felt like I can't stand working with all these, all my family. I've 
always enjoyed it because, and I'm separated, it's not like I'm down there, you know.  
 
VP: 
But, so yeah, you're kind of in a nice spot.   
 
SH: 
Yeah, yeah, yes, yes.  
 
VP: 
But for the men working in the plant, is it differe? 
 
SH: 
No, they adjust where they need to, but I think it’s a very positive thing.  
 
VP: 
So, what would you say is kind of a favorite part of your job that you enjoy the most, 
both in terms of your specific position, but also working in the industry more generally?  
 
[00:35:39] 
 
SH: 
Um, I like working with people. Like, just this company is so big and diverse that, like , 
I have people that work in New York or, you know, all over that I have, that I talk to on a 
regular basis, so that's interesting to me. But you have all these connections of outside of 
Pennsylvania, but we all work for the same company and common goal. So, that's a neat part. 
The favorite part of my actual job is doing payroll. I don't know, I just really like doing payroll.  
 
VP: 
So, you mentioned it's been a little bit challenging during the pandemic. Could you talk 
a little bit about how the pandemic changed your work and work at the plant?  
 
SH: 
Well, we did have a small layoff because we weren't, I mean we were still open because 
we were essential, but we did have to lay off a few workers. And it was just really for a short 
period of time. And I think when it first happened, we were all scared. Like, there was so much 
unknown in the world, so much unknown. And so, we were like, we're not going to be doing 
the business that we that we might normally do. But I'm telling you, the trucks still came in. I 
think that it did not change our business. And I feel like the company as a whole, Lehigh 
Hansen, handled the whole pandemic great with communication and guidelines. And, you 
know, but as far as the industry, I think it's thriving right now. I don't see … I mean I feel bad 
for places that had to shut down and restaurants and all that. But our industry, we're still here 
and we're still plugging away and we're still making cement. And it's, like, never going to go 
away. You're always going to need cement. That's how I feel.  
 
VP: 
Why do you think it's such an important industry?  
 
[00:38:07]

SH: 
Because of, I mean, look at all the construction going on, road work, it's such a reliable 
product that I don't foresee it ever going away.  
 
VP: 
Do workers worry about maybe running out of the rock?  
 
SH: 
Um, I think that there's worries of this plant closing sometime because it's so old, but 
that's like a periodic worry. Like, every once in a while somebody will throw it out there like, 
oh, but I feel like our plant is so good. Like, we take on a lot of business that other plants can't 
handle. It seems like we're always the ones that come through when needed, this plant.  
 
VP: 
That's awesome. So, in closing out the interview, is there something that we haven't 
discussed or something that I didn't ask you about that you'd like to comment on?  
 
SH: 
No, I've been blabbing away now for a while now. No, I think we covered it all.  
 
VP: 
Thank you so much for your time, it's such a pleasure to speak to you.  
 
SH: 
Thank you. It was nice meeting you.
