notes 
Lyntha Eiler/phone call 3-30-81 with Carl Fleischhauer 
The wrestling match — shot during the project— one was called 
the Mid—Eastern Championship Wrestling match 
at the Laurel Rescue Squad — in their bldg, also a community 
center bldg— in a part of the county "out of the official project area 
north and west in the county- on CR -740, next to a big, newish school. 
XgX These events are sort of frequent in the XXKEXX area, and at the 
this place— so probably not exactly a fund raiser. 
The wrestlers are drawn from a particular area, they wrestle on a sort 
of circuit. Lyntha' sense was that the "area" was a region, less extensive 
than a whole state, but possibly crossing state lines. The wrestlers 
have day jobs — Lyntha's babysitter—Ida Easter (married to Rufus) 
who lived in Galax had a grandson (name not XXKftjittKXwra remembered) 
whol lived with them, he wrestled in this circuit. His day job 
was (??) employed in a factory in Galax. 
Lyntha also photographed another meet in North Carolina, but not far 
from Galax, at a high school gym, sponsored by a different organization. 
Tom Adler went and too|: a tape recorder; but the folks thought they 
were stealing ideas for other wrestlers add "we werre were hassled; I don't 
think we made any tapes." This place and its wrestlers seemed a little 
more professional, they'd been at it longer. The ones at the Laurel Rescue 
were younger, kids, just IOfi[XX= star ting out.
