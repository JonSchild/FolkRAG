Barbara Orbach - "Some Thoughts on the Colorado Internship"

Some Thoughts on the Colorado Internship 
Twelve days is not a long time in-which to develop 
insight into a region's history and culture; I would not 
argue that this is what I accomplished in my twelve days of 
working with Howard Marshall, Elke Dettmer, and John Farr on 
ranching history and folklife in Grand and Summit counties 
of Colorado. What I did emerge with was some intriguing hints 
about settlement history in this region, a wealth of impressions 
about the lifestyles of the people who occupy it, and a 
powerful learning experience concerning the processes and 
issjues involved in doing fieldwork. These I will continue 
to synthesize and reflect on for some time to come. 
In the flurry of the moment it was difficult to perceive 
how rounded an experience we were enjoying through our many 
activities. Its balanced contours could only be appreciated 
after the fact. 
Heavy concentration on ranching culture in the course of 
the fieldwork could have easily blurred our vision to the 
in some ways more significant mining history of the region. 
But an expedition led by John Farr to some spectacular mining 
sites and the daily physical presence of miles of dredge heaps 
as we travelled the area created a vivid impression and a 
constant reminder of a crucial phase in this territory's 
economic and cultural history. Moreover, they prompted me 
to reflect about humans' relationship to this mountainous, 
beautiful place—both their ability and their inability to 
adapt to its rigors, to at once appreciate and exploit its 
resources. Here I could perceive a real continuity extending 
OCI.L iJQL d l/iuaui

from the period of white settlement in the region to the present. 
The visual testimony of mines, gravel heaps and reservoirs 
current 
was supplemented by our discussions about theAimpact of 
local tourism and real estate development in deepening my 
understanding about the inevitable interaction between humans 
and their environment that takes place here as well as in 
the "flat lands". 
This points out another virtue of the way we approached 
folklife research in the region: it incorporated both evidence 
of the past and an appraisal of contemporary folklife. Although 
the^ fieldwork nominally was designed to address matters of 
history, the play-off between present and past provided 
invaluable dimension in understanding both. I discussed the 
incredible rate of transiency in the local population with 
the Farrs, I heard from the county assessor how it affected 
the turnover rate in his office, I learned from Loma McKee 
about how it impacts on her involvement in community life, and 
I listened to ideas expressed by the Rotarians for generating 
tourism that would sustain the local economy. This had the 
effect of adding continuity and dimension to what I had read 
about the early forms of tourism and the unending attempts to 
search out economic opportunity in this region. 
.In an undertaking such as this one, where field time is 
limited and research activities hinge on the schedules and 
responsiveness of others, each decision about where to devote 
one's energies seems crucial; time spent gathering information in 
one place means lost opportunities elsewhere. My instinctive 
assessment upon spending time during the latter portion of our 
Barbara Orbach 
-3- 
fieldwork with the Knorrs, who proved a valuable mine of 
information about early ranching in the valley, was that we 
could have gained more information about folklife in the 
region by dealing with them more intensively and devoting less 
of our energies to the McKees who, although they inhabit an 
old ranch site, are newcomers to the area. But, upon reflection, 
I realized that spending time with both families again-afforded 
us a valuable balance in our work. Together, these families 
helped me to understand aspects of Colorado's settlement 
history and the continuities between past and present on more 
than an intellectual level, and to gain a more vivid sense 
of the nature of ranch life itself. 
The Knorrs and the McKees represent two distinct stages 
in the settlement and development of the area. The Knorr 
prcff-*/ 
Brothers Ranch is the product of early settlement and/(accumulation 
in the area. Its extensive holdings, despite inroads made 
by the Green Mountain Reservoir project and the recent sale 
of a parcel, allow it to remain a. viable, if sometimes overwhelming, 
operation. 
The McKee family's habitation of a sub-division of an 
older ranchstead is, on the other hand, the latest stage in 
a steady, incremental migration. Vera McKee, at least, would 
like to devote herself to full-time ranching, but their 
40 acre lot, even when supplemented by the meadowland and 
accompanying water rights they lease across the road, is 
insufficient to sustain a full ranching operation. Rather, 
family members engage in a diversity of occupations—excavating 
and working in the molybdenum mines, for example—more viable 
in terms of current trends in the local economy.

Despite the differences in their circumstances, however, 
both ranching families have had to contend with the quirks of 
nature and the long range trends and short range fluctuations 
in the economy which are accompanied by the varied forms of 
development, both public and private, ongoing along the 
iBlue in the last century and a half. Moreover, there are 
some shared qualities in the way they approach their life and 
work here. Every conversation with a family member made me 
aware of their basic individuality, but the ranching tasks 
themselves demand a level of cooperation that was quite remarkable 
to me, who is only familiar with the kind of individualized 
employments people engage in in my urban setting. Two scenes 
that I observed symbolized the cooperative facet of ranching 
for me. The first was the hay raking and stacking operations 
that I observed on three separate occasions and that I likened 
to a dance—guided by an intricate but very familiar choreography 
practiced by the people running the machines. The second was 
the doctoring session for the Callahan's colt, when six people 
quietly stood for nearly two hours•in the hot sun, intent on a 
single operation. 
Partly because our questions were geared primarily towards 
family history, I carried away a distinct impression of the 
importance of family in these people's lives and an understanding 
that tradition can exist here inside the family unit, without 
necessary relation to the immediate environment or the current 
activities and practices of its bearers. The main thrust of 
my interview with Mrs. Knorr concerned the centrality of family 
in her life. The tale of William Smallwood, the McKees' 
i 
adi'Uald Ui oacn 
-5- 
"Choctaw Indian" ancestor amounted to almost a legend cycle 
within that family unit—I heard variants of it from members 
of each of the three generations living on the site. When 
Karl Knorr spoke about ranching history and his ranching practices, 
mostly 
it was framed^in terms of the contributions he knew members of 
his family to have made. Our encounters with these families 
drove home to me how much the family exists as an idea and an 
identity as well as an economic unit. This is, perhaps, why 
despite the fact the Charlie Lund is a bonified "old timer" 
with a long tenure on the land, I felt there ..to be something 
amiss on his ranch. Not only did he have no surviving family 
and seem to retain little in the way of family traditions, but 
he was existing in what seemed a not particularly family-like 
group on his own property. 
The significance ascribed to family seemed to inform the 
attitudes of those we spoke with towards history and historical 
objects. Although the McKees operate amidst a clutter.of artifacts 
and notable log buildings, they seemed to demonstrate enthusiasm 
and care only for a collection of ©ld-family saddles that they 
■to si+c 
had broughtAwith them. Mrs. Knorr treasured those family 
heirlooms that she could connect with the personality.of the 
former possesor (and, perhaps, with a very real economic value, 
as well) and that she could aetively refurbish (put her mark-- 
or stain—on?) and pass on to the succeeding generations. 
The understandings I achieved about regional history, 
the family and tradition through my conteu-pt with the Knorrs 
and the McKees were not novel or profound, but they did inform 
my thinking about W^iere and how I would conduct folkli-fa ’.and 
oat. uclj. <x Ui.uaUi 
-6- 
historical research, collect objects to present the thrust of 
that research to a wider audience, and arrange such a presentation 
to be as meaningful as possible to that audience. 
Satisfying as my rather abstract explorations into the 
relationships between the family, the personality, tradition 
and history were to me, I was happily—and literally—brought 
down to earth by Rusty Marshall's emphasis on their physical 
manifestations—the material culture of the region. The time, 
care, and patience that Rusty expended in teaching us about 
the forms, construction and uses of material objects was 
invaluable in starting me to consider what material objects 
can tell us (or rather, prompt; us to ask) about history, 
and to appreciate how vital the dynamic is between cultural 
tradition and environmental conditions. R..u sty's emphasis 
on methodically recording the widest conceivable context as 
well as the more minute details of those artifacts and events 
we considered,provided what I feel to be an important and useful 
model for conducting research. In the process, he introduced 
both the practical and the theoretical issues concerning 
historic preservation and presentation, which provided solid 
grounding to what could easily have become a rather academic 
exercise. 
Elke and I were given the opportunity to consider in a 
concrete way how community support for a cultural project is 
generated, by sitting in on a Rotarian club meeting where Rusty 
presented aspects of the research and the High Mountain Museum 
project, and by being encouraged by Rusty to discuss that 
presentation afterwards. Equally important were our visits to 
Barbara orbach 
-7- 
the existing museums in the area and the opportunities given 
us to critique these. I recognize with gratitude that in 
those visits the interests of the interns and the promotion 
of their critical thinking were.placed ahead of the interest 
in producing immediate, tangible field data. These expeditions 
served as an occasion for us to think realistically about the 
issues of funding, audience:!', physical design, and content— 
all of which would be integral to the formation of any presentation 
that would attempt to communicate what we were learning about 
this region, its people and its history. The fact that we already 
had our format—a living history exhibit—in mind,made that 
«* * 
thinking easier and more rewarding.. 
Equally important to my learning process on this trip was 
the fact that in our twelve days together, Rusty, Elke and I 
acted as a field team. This gave me a fine opportunity to 
sample a much lauded, but seldom executed, form of research 
and to consider its virtues and drawbacks. I think in our 
case the effort was quite successful; the three of us were 
able to coordinate and cooperate congenially and productively. 
Because we are three separate personalities with different 
interests, our ears and eyes were tuned to different details; 
COrmAi rvxirvVai'V jv*t 
thus, we ivere able to .gain three ^perspectives rather thahNone 
in any given field end$..civt©r. By comparing notes afterwards, 
our overall perception of our encounters was expanded and new 
issues were raised. A case in point was when Rusty uncovered 
a prize artifact—an old ski—lying abandoned in the McKfee yard 
and perceived how the McKee's valuation of it changed as a 
result of his stated interest!. Rusty was surprised that this 
i_> cl a. o x. a uj. 
-8- 
obseryation hadn't entered into either hike's or my account 
of our interactions with the McKees. But the point was that 
this was Rusty's interaction with the McKees—conveying i^ 
to us only added to impressions we had formed through our own 
separate interactions and interpretations. 
Although we might have benefitted or produced more by 
splitting up more frequently (I found that some of my most 
intensive learning occurred out ofvneces*'vihen I was left to 
my own devices) travelling as a team carried the unintended 
impact of making us appear more official or serious, I think, 
than a single one of us would. This has negative as well as 
positive implications, for I do think we'were on occasion viewed 
as somewhat of an onslaught. The pure logistics of three 
people concentratedly collecting information from the same 
sources may have caused us to overtax and overwhelm those 
we talked with—our interaction with Vera McKee springs to 
mind as an instance where this might have been the case. 
Obviouslyy it is impossible for three people to be as sensitive 
collectively as they might be individually, and I was often 
concerned lest we ride roughshod over our very obliging new 
acquaintances. Indeed, questions of ethics and etiquette 
recurred constantly for me throughout the twelve days; although 
we did touch on these issues occasionally in our conversations, 
I think we might have addressed them more squarely in evaluating 
ourselves and our effect on those we spoke with and, in some 
ways, influenced. 
I wouldn't have missed those days of combined effort in 
the field for anything. I think every field team should have 
such an initial opportunity to observe how their co-workers 
-9- 
operate and interpret and to hammer out their mutual focus and 
approach on this basis. Perhaps the only misfortune of our 
field experience was that it was too short. We had only reached 
the "hammering out" stage of understanding what we wanted to 
know and how each of us could go about finding it out when 
our newly achieved momentum was brought to a screeching halt 
by a circled number on a calendar. Even an extra week would 
have allowed us to become a fully operational team, in the 
sense that Elke and I could have become more self-initiating 
and self-reliant (one can hypothesize so, at any rate!). 
Although I appreciated that Rusty made us quickly understand 
that in this sort of research one must remain flexible and 
rise to opportunities whenever they present themselves, an 
expanded time frame would have allowed us to plan more 
effectively, putting all of our energies in the field when 
•that's where we stood, and setting aside time in advance 
specifically to be away from the field and to gather our 
thoughts, either jointly or individually. (A one-day declared 
holiday in memory of the field note would have been appreciated. 
My own note^ Visaed to be wedged in between pillows at night 
and slices of bread during the day, and thereby suffered what 
degradation my inexperience hadn't already contributed.) 
Saying that we acted as a field.-team says reams about this, my 
^itstfield experience. As I told Rusty at the conclusion of 
the trip, in these twelve day3 I engaged in the most intensive 
and rewarding learning experience I have ever had. i hope 
that if my field notes reflect nothing else, they reflect this. 
The fact that I was at all times treated with respect, as 
an equal with a worthwhile contribution to make made this 
Barbara Orbach 
-10- 
learning possible. I was make to feel a full-fledged participant 
through my interactions with Rusty Marshall, Elke Dettmer, 
and the Farrs. Moreover, the unspoken cues--the thoughtful 
arrangement made by the Farrs for our comfort and entertainment, 
.and the careful>preparation carried out by Rusty in concert 
with the staff of the American Folklife Center bespoke the 
quality of my acceptance and the earnestness of our intent. 
I appreciate the faith with which all the people involved 
invested time—for extra planning, preparations, explanations, 
and special expeditions—and money in providing me with an 
introduction to a new region and a new field of research. 
I plan to prove it a sound investment. This field experience— 
so sanely balanced between the past and the present, between 
the human and the material, and between the theoretical and 
the practical--marks my current studies as well as my daily 
activities and reflections. I would like to express my deepest 
gratitude to John and Leslie Farr and the Rocky Mountain 
Continental Divide Foundation, and Rusty Marshall and the 
American Folklife Center for making that experience possible.
