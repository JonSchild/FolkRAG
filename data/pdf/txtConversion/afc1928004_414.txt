THE IRISH ALDERMEN . 
As 
sung by HARRY and JoHN KERNELL. 
Two Irish aldermen are we, 
Our education it is fine; 
Elected by a 
majority, 
As orators we both do shine; 
Solid Democrats are we, 
Working for the people's cause, 
Selected for our elegance 
To regulate the city laws. 
CHORUS. 
We dress so neat it is a 
treat 
To see us marching hand in hand ; 
Heads erect—you can't expect to see 
A 
sight again so grand; 
With a 
brand new shirt free from dirt, 
We're the finest in the land, 
With a 
brand new dice we look so nice, 
We are Irish aldermen. 
Our influence is powerful 
Throughout the city and State; 
We can put you in the park 
To keep the flies out of the gate ; 
Our wardrobe is fastidious, 
Cut out in the latest style, 
We captivate the ladies, and they always 
Greet us with a 
smile. 
We dress so neat, etc. 
MEN OF EDUCATION. 
• 
Song and Dance by ninny and RHIN KERNELL. 
DON'T talk to us of your high-toned men, 
With their fluent conversation, 
For with us boys none can compare, 
We are the greatest in the nation ; 
We are known by all, both great and small, 
Two Irishmen from Donegal, 
And we'll have ye know, both one and all, 
We're men of education. 
CHORUS. 
We are Irishmen both heart and hand, 
We have just come here to this free land, 
And we'll have you all to understand 
We are men of education. 
Now the mayor of the town he is our best friend, 
And we drink with him every day; 
He is going to run us for Congressmen, 
And you bet we'll make it pay ; 
Muldoon is envious of our fame, 
And Roger O'Malley has changed his name, 
And the ladies are wanting to know the names 
Of the men of education. 
We are Irishmen, etc.

STREET SCENE. 
Enter McSwEGAN. 
McSwEGAN. Well, I 
have just come into town to meet 
nn old friend of mine from the same place in Ireland as 
myself; but he has risen in the world and keeps a 
lager 
beer brewery in Keokuk, Iowa. I 
don't see him, so I 
vill step down to McNally's saloon. 
Probably he will 
come along while I 
am gone. 
[Exit. 
Enter CROSSIN. 
CROSSIN. I 
wonder where McSwegan is. 
He promised 
to meet me here. 
As I 
was coming around the corner a 
little girl looked at me in the face and says, " There's 
General Grant." I 
looked around and says, " You lie, 
sis," but I 
don't think she seen the point. 
Another little 
fellow says, " Stag the Mick with the lantern jaw." 
Enter McSwEGAN. 
ArcSwEGAN. Good morning, Barney. 
CROS. Good afternoon. 
McS. What kept you so quick ? 
CROS. I 
couldn't come any later. 
McS. Have you had any trouble lately at your house ? 
CEOS. Yes, we had a 
railroad accident. 
McS. I 
didn't hear anything about it. 
What was it ? 
OROS. Mary Ann O'Brien hung herself with her back 
hair. 
McS. How do you make that out a 
railroad accident ? 
OROS. Why, heir 
death was caused by a 
misplaced 
switch. 
McS. It's a 
wonder they didn't put you up for a 
head-
light. 
GROS. If I 
had your mouth we might have used it for 
a 
tunnel. 
McS. Well, are you working now ? 
CRos. No; I 
have not worked for three months. 
McS. I 
can get you a 
fine job. 
CROS. What doing ?

ORIGINAL IRISH SKETCH.—Continued. 
McS. Why, a 
friend of mine wants to put you in an 
envelope ; he wants to send a 
valentine to a 
shoemaker. 
CROS. Say, when you go home you want to eat all the 
salt you can get ; you are the freshest rooster I 
ever saw. 
McS. Well, if you don't like that job, put molasses on 
your whiskers and hire yourself out for fly paper. 
CROS. Will you be doing anything to-morrow ? 
McS. No, I 
guess not. 
Why ? 
CROS. Well, I 
would like to have you come with me to 
a 
photograph gallery ; I 
want your picture. 
McS. What do you want with my picture ? 
CROS. I 
want to give it to the police. 
I 
lost my mon-
key. 
McS. Well, if I 
thought there was a 
reward for you T 
would bring you home again. 
CROS. Did you hear the news ? 
MeS. No ; what is it ? 
CROS. It's all over town. 
McS. What ? 
CROS. Mud. 
McS That's a 
very good joke. 
CROS. It is. 
Will you have a 
cigar ? 
McS. I 
Will. 
CROS. Then go buy one. 
McS. You are not smoking now, are you ? 
Cups. No, not at present. 
McS. I 
see the mud has covered them up. 
CROS. See here, do you know any conundrums ? 
McS. I 
don't know what you mean. 
CROS. I 
mean, do you know anything I 
ought to ' give 
? 
McS. You ought to give up them two dollars you owe 
me. 
CROS. Well, ask me some conundrum. 
MeS. All right. 
Which is the best way to make fish-
balls without the fish ? 
Cnos. Why, send the potatoes home C. 0. D. 
What 
looks most like the half moon ? 
McS. Why, the other half. 
Cnos. Why is the mosquito a 
good poker player ? 
McS. Because every time he draws he tills. 
CROS. Well, what chance have I 
got ? 
Ask me one.

ORIGINAL IRISH SKETCH.— Concluded. 
McS. All right. 
Which is the best way to keep a 
dog 
from going mad in August ? 
OROS. Shoot him in July. 
McS. Which is the best way to find a 
young lady out ? 
CROS. Why, go around to see her some day when she 
is not in. 
INIeS. Well, now, ask me a 
hard one. 
CROS. All right. 
Why are your two feet like an Italian 
organ grinder ? 
McS. I 
will give it up. 
Why are your two feet like an 
Italian organ grinder? Because he carries a 
monkey 
around all day. 
CROS. What makes a 
chicken go across the street ? 
Because he wants to get on the other side. 
Why didn't 
you answer that, you burn ? 
MeS. You didn't give me a 
chance. 
CEOs. How long can a 
jackass stand on one leg ? 
McS. You get up and try.

MY SWEET BROTHER TEDDY. 
By 
HARRY BENNETT. 
I 
ONCE had a 
brother, the son of his mother, 
But somehow or other, ye see, 
Though he was a 
darling he always was snarling, 
With me could never agree ; 
He'd hardly say twenty words in a 
day, 
If he thought he was going to be kilt, 
But his mouth he'd pucker like some big sucker, 
And this is the tune he would lilt. 
( 
Whistle with piccolo accompaniment.) 
My sweet brother Teddy he ever was ready 
To whistle a 
tune at your call; 
He always was merry, his mouth like a 
cherry 
Played sweeter than pipes at a 
ball; 
He's whistled his landlady out of her rent, 
He whistled his mother-in-law sick, 
Till some big Italian, the dirty rapscallion, 
Knocked out Teddy's teeth with a 
brick.

, 
Now " After Dark" I 
like to roam, 
And have a " Loving Cup," 
Or at the hunt, I'm quite " at home," 
And with the master sup. 
I'm sweet on " Rural Felicity," 
Can course, when I've the chance-
And as to give a " Blow for Blow," 
Why, I'm par excellence. 
Spoken—Yes, every fellow ought to stand up in defence of the 
fair sex from a

be a " Woman of the World," or a " Girl of the Period."—Cuoans, 
as before.

And at the side of " Royalty," 
A " Standard" man to row, 
As Volunteer was in the " Queens,"

As quite par excellence.

Makes me au fait in French. 
No " Grecian" eye to ' Drury Lane,' 
Where ballet girls do prance, 
To charm " Princesses," my finesse 
Is thought par excellence. 
Spoken—Some find in the " Bower" of the South a " Gallery 
of Illustration," but give me the " Pavillion

"City of London," where I

OWEN REILLY. 
Sung with immense success by HARRY KERNELIft 
On, my name is Owen Reilly, 
I 
have a 
son that's got me crazy; 
He is out every night singing comic songs 
He learns at sonie free and easy ; 
He wanted his mother to put on the gloves with him, 
He broke his little brother's leg with a 
poker; 
He has an old pack of cards he carries in his pocket, 
And he wants me to play Sanco Pedro and the Joker; 
He kicked his sister Honora in the forehead last week, 
He bate the eldest boy of cross-eyed McCarty; 
He goes prancing around to the Sunday eve balls, 
And he has a 
girl on the stage at the Varieties. 
He pawned my Sunday clothes last week 
To go and lay a 
wager; 
He brought me down town in the middle of the night 
To fight with a 
big black nager. 
There's his cousin Mike is a 
fine young man, 
With the nicest kind of manners ; 
Night after night they go walking around, 
And they call it carrying- the banners; 
But the two of them got in a 
scrape, 
They stole a 
Dutchman's pony; 
Poor Mike is in the workhouse now 
And Bernard's in California. 
He tied a 
tin can on our dog's tail 
When we went to church last Sunday • 
He got stiff broiling tight, stayed out all night, 
And was nu before the Court House on Monday; 
He is (rot the house all turned inside out, 
He has gone to the bad entirely; 
Some fine day I 
fear he will be hung, 
Lord help you, Bernard Reilly; 
He says he is taking lessons f
rom 
Professor 
John Dwyer; 
He wants 
pi
e and sponge cake for his supper, 
He comes home every night full of gin, 
And he throws the corn beef and cabbage in the gutter.

MARY McGUCKEN. 
Sung by W ILLIAM liozy. 
On, ladies and gentlemen, listen to me, 
I 
will tell of a.lady you all did see; 
She is not very short, she's not very tall, 
She wears a 
pull-back and a 
large waterfall; 
The first time I 
met her I 
shall never forget her, 
She was buying bananas from a 
man in the street; 
Says I, " How's your dad ?" says she, " Get out, you tad, 
Or I 
will hit you a 
lick in the forehead, 
:You healthy dead beat. 
CHORUS. 
Her name was McGucken, you bet she's a 
tough one; 
She always drinks porter when she's on a 
spree, 
And with her umbrella she could mash any fellow, 
Could Mary McGucken, the pride of Broadway. 
Her hair it was red, her eyes were black, 
Her feet were small, she had a 
hump on her back, 
And when she would sing the air would ring 
Just like a 
horsecar that got off the track; 
But since I 
last seen her she joined Barnum's Circus; 
Upon the trapeze she was to appear; 
But when she came out a 
boy did shout, 
So she slid down the rope and walked off on her ear. 
Her name was McGucken, etc.

GEORGE MAGEE. 
By HARRY BENNETT. 
• 
I AM a 
man of di itinction and learning, ye see, 
I 
am a 
thorough sport every time ; 
I 
am the flower of fashion wherever I 
be; 
With the boys I've spent many a 
dime ; 
I 
can play casino, I 
can live fast or slow, 
Whichever may suit me the best, 
And whenever I 
stop at a 
ball or a 
hop 
I 
have a 
gold watch in my vest, oh, yes, 
CHORUS. 
I

Just look at me, 
And you will see 
An Irishman 
Of high degree; 
The ladies' pet, 
I'm George Magee. 
I 
have a 
wink in my eye that does capture the girls, 
And my smiles they can never resist ; 
My black Carolinas the barber he curls, 
And I 
have a 
gold ring on my fist, 
And every one knows as they look at my clothes 
They're made of good stuff, firm and strong; 
As I 
walk on the street every damsel I 
meet 
Pipes my figure as I 
move along. 
I 
am George Magee.

All these affairs, &c.

MeGLNNISS. 
Written by HARRY BENNETT. 
A 
YOUNG man to this city came, 
In walking he was slightly game, 
Patricius was his maiden name— 
Mc 
Gi nniss. 
The boys they used to call him gimps, 
As on the street he'd slowly limp, 
They sold him Croton bugs for shrimp— 
MeGiuniss. 
Taking a 
kind friend's good advice. 
He went and got a 
job so nice, 
In the undertaker's, cracking ice— 
McGinnis& 
At first the times were rather rough, 
Bat now he's doing well enough, 
For he can stand them—he is tough— 
AlicG inn iss. 
Long live that good young man, say I, 
And when time comes for him to die, 
Free lunches one and all will cry— 
McGinniss. 
YOUR FACE WOULD STOP A CLOCK. 
As sung by JOHN KERNELL. 
I AM a, man that bad lots of trouble, 
But you heard that before ; 
I 
am known all around town 
And on Jersey's distant shore ; 
I 
never meddled in politics, 
Or worked around the dock, 
But the boys all say as they pass my way, 
" 
Your face would stop a 
clock." 
CHORUS. 
I 
spend my money free, my boys, 
I 
am solid as a 
rock; 
But the girls all say as they pass my way, 
" 
Your face would stop a 
clock." 
I 
went down the other day 
Along with a 
friend of mine, 
When a 
little boy with a 
box on his back 
Says, " Terrier, do you want a 
shine ?" 
I 
hit him on the head with my umbrella, 
But he soon recovered from the shock, 
And jumping up quick he yelled out loud, 
" 
Your face would stop a 
clock." 
I 
spend my money, etc. 
MY SWEET MARY ANN. 
By HARRY BENNETT. 
I AM fond of courting, also of sporting, 
I 
often go courting the girl I 
adore; 
Her hair she does crimple, her cheek has a 
dimple, 
Her nose has a 
pimple five days out of four; 
Her first name is Mary, her last name is Cary ; 
She never gets airy, the dear little sprite; 
She's pretty, she's witty, the belle of the city, 
And walks like a 
kitty, with step prim and light. 
CHORUS. 
Have you seen Mary, light as a 
fairy ? 
Never contrary, sings like a 
canary, 
From old Tipperary, she works in a 
dairy, 
And never gets weary, my sweet Mary Ann. 
Her voice is soprano, she plays the piano ; 
The " Star Spangled Banner" is the song she sings; 
Her style would amaze ye and set ye all crazy. 
With the songs of this daisy the neighborhood 
ring; 
Her appearance is dashing, shs dresses in fashion, 
She's the darling for mashing the boys evirywhere; 
We're soon to be married, too long we have tarried; 
Four years she has carried a 
lock of my hair. 
Uave you seen Mary ? etc.

WE ARE THE MEN FOR THE PLACE. 
Written and sang by HARRY and Jon KERNELL. 
No doubt you have heard of the Delanies, 
The men who were tall, lank, and lean ; 
They were the smartest men ever left Wexford town, 
And the biggest liars that ever were seen ; 
They came to America on a 
horse's back, 
And on the ocean with a 
ship ran a 
race. 
SPOKEN 
Ai 
if you want two men that can walk one 
hundred miles in the short space of twenty-four hours, 
we are the men can do it. 
We can sing, dance and out-
whistle any other men from the same county in Ireland, 
and don't forget that if you want governors or consta-
bles, or two men that can vote three times in every ward 
on election day, send for us. 
We can clean out a 
first-
class lunch table in ten minutes. 
I 
tell you we are the 
bone and sinew of the Democratic party, and we can 
pull more planks from under the Democratic party than 
any other two men from Maine to the Pacific slope, and 
if you intend opening a 
saloon, send for us; if you in-
tend opening a 
jail, you can bet we are the men for the 
Place. 
CHORUS. 
We are the men for the place, 
We are the men for the place: 
With a 
shovel or pick. 
Or two rale Irish Micks, 
We are the men for the place. 
When we came to America, long ago, 
And stepped on your great Union land, 
It was us that started the first hand organ, 
And opened the first peanut stand; 
We were the originals of the ten cent balloon, 
Tom Collins put a 
stamp on your face. 
SPOKEN. — And if you want a 
couple of actors to play 
in Jack Sheppard, we are the men for the place. 
We are the men, etc. 
TWO GREENHORNS. 
Written and Sung by Tan FIELD/NCI. 
W E'RU what yees call greentetas, 
We're only just landed, 
From the city of Dublin, 
Afar over the sea ; 
Though to be called green, 
We will not stand it,

Tho' our native land 'tis grean, 
Oh, that's no reason why 
That we should be called tile same, 
Remember that, me boys. 
'Twas not want nor starvation 
That brought us amongst you, 
As from our appearances 
That you can see. 
For at home we had plenty,

But we longed for to see,

IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. 
WHEN rwas born, some years ago, ' twas prophesied of me, 
That, if I 
lived to be a 
man, a 
wonder I 
should be; 
But now I've come to man's estate, I 
must -say with regret, 
I 
may turn out a 
wonder, but it hasn't happened yet. 
I 
may turn, etc. 
When I was sent to Grammar School where I was taught tb 
flak, 
I 
spent my time in writing rhyme, if not in rhyming right; 
'Tis sorrowful to know it, but my plans are a!1 upset; 
I 
may turn out a 
poet, but it hasn't happened yet. 
I 
may turn, etc. 
Last season, when at Leamington, I 
courted, but in vain, 
A 
fascinating damsel, by the name of Kitty Payne ; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry, but she said, " My darling pet, 
Some day perhaps I'll love you; " but it hasn't happened yet. 
Some day, etc. 
As with a 
confidential friend, next morn, I 
broke my fast; 
"By Jove!" he said, " you're settled, Fred, she's done you 
brown at last ; 
Here Kitty Payne has run away with little Captain Brett." 
1 
thought my heart had broken but it hasn't happened yet. 
I 
thought, etc. 
Of course, I 
saw the value of a 
sympathising friend, 
And parted when he'd asked me if a 
fiver I 
would lend. 
Says he, " I'll pay to-morrow ; for I 
hate to be in debt; " 
But I 
find out, to my sorrow, that it hasn't happened yet. 
But I 
find, etc. 
A much respected maiden- aunt I 
thought had lately died, 
And left me just a 
thousand pounds, a 
house and lands besides, 
All this I 
learnt by telegram; but a 
friend of hers I 
met, 
Consoled my grief by saying that it hadn't happened yet. 
Consoled, etc. 
One evening, when out for a 
stroll, I 
found a 
clumsy thief 
Without my leave was borrowing my pocket- handkerchief; 
He bellowed when I 
kicked him with a 
force he won't forget, 
He thought I 
was the victim, but it hasn't happened yet. 
He thought, etc. 
And now a 
fair good- night to all, my song is nearly done, 
And may success attend us where there's fortunes to be won; 
Let's breast the hill with such a 
will as knows not how to fret, 
(1 we'll win the goal with honor suzli as never happened yet. 
And we'll, etc.

GEORGE CONSTANTINE M cICEOWN. 
Words and Music by

U. 
HARDING. 
A 
DANDY and a 
lady's man has come before you now, 
A 
man of taste and culture, for ' tis written on my brow ; 
In Irish circles I'm the pet of all the ladies fair, 
And I 
always meet with favor and a 
hearty welcome there. 
The reason must be obvious, I 
don't make use of slang; 
I 
use well chosen language, which surprises all the gang. 
You'll often hear the ladies say, " Now hasn't he the tone ? 
He ought to be a 
counsellor, George Constantine Mc-
Keown." 
I'm in the book and picture trade, I 
canvass every day; 
And tho' the times are very hard, I 
always make it pay. 
The literature of Ireland I 
have at my command, 
And when I'm talking up a 
trade my style is great and 
grand; 
I 
tell them how brave Sarsfield fought and kept the foe 
at bay, 
And how the women held the fort at Limerick town that 
day; 
I 
get them all excited, for I 
am no dunce or drone; 
You'll hear them cry, " I'll take four books, George Con-
stantine McKeown." 
You ought to hear me make a 
speech about election time ; 
I 
overflow with eloquence, with anecdote, with rhyme; 
My attitudes are picturesque, and I 
can plainly show 
That I'm the Irish orator, the Celtic " Cicero." 
Some try to imitate me, but their show attempts are vile; 
They cannot catch my lofty tone, my grand imperious 
style. 
Let spurious imitators fall, for equals I 
have none ; 
I 
am the great original, George Constantine McKeown.

Cno.—Then going to the beds, etc. 
There are scenes and sights round Dublin that are dear to

Besides the bill of Howth and the famous Strawberry-beds.

'Twas in the middle of the fun, 
I 
think just at the hour of one, 
The guests they mighty quick did run, 
Prom the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
O'Leary, if I 
don't mistake, 
Thought it high time that he shonld wake. 
-Wid fear, says he, 
make 'em quake, 
So he gave the coffin a 
sudden shake, 
Thin ould Leary loud did cry, 
This waking me is all me eye, 
F,,r I 
Myer did intind to die, 
I 
didn't says Mr. O'Leary. 
Swearing, tearing, 
For help the guests quite loud did call, 
Och, murder, thieves, each one did bawl 
Och, wasn't there a 
precious squall, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary, 
Old Leary thin did come to view, 
And at the company he flew. 
And hate them all sure, black and blue, 
Och, 'pon my soul all this is throe. 
Some on crutches hobbled home, 
And swore again they ne'er would roam, 
While others loud, with pains did groan, 
With the bating they got from O'Leary.

Ant:—" Bing of the Cannibal Islands." 
In Ireland, so I've heard, 
To wake the dead they have a 
way, 
They get dead drunk, and on the Sure, do lay 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary, 
lie whit quite dead, one Sunday night, 
Which put his friends in sad atrrig,ht, 
From this world he had taken flight, 
So they drank his health with all their might-
They danced and reeled about, Oh, dear, 
For the whiskey made 'em feel so queer, 
I'm sure they had the best of cheer, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary, 
CHORUS. 
Swearing, tearing, all the night, 
Putting. whiskey out of sight, 
Good cheer, did all the guests invite, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
Twas in the first flare under ground, 
Where all the mirth, sure, did abound, 
And where the whiskey quick wint round, 
At the wake of Mr. O'Leary. 
There was a 
policeman off his bate, 
Among the rest, came to the fate, 
And rowled about like many a 
baste, 
Pin sure he did not drink the last, 
Then Saul's (lead march, the piper played 
But I 
am told he ne'er got paid, 
To spake the truth I'm not afraid, 
About the wake of Mr. O'Leary.

CHESTERFIELD DieFLYNN . 
Written by ilkititY BENNETT. 
ALTHOUGH I 
have no money, 
I'm just as sweet as honey ; 
I 
travel on my shape, because 
I'm neither stout nor thin; 
The girls all say I'm pretty, 
And also wise and witty ; 
There's not a 
masher in this town 
Like Chesterfield McFlyun. 
CHORUS. 
By-bye, Charlie, you're a 
pet of mine; 
I'll meet you in the clock 
'When the lane strikes nine ; 
I'll strike you with a 
gum drop, 
You giddy little lass ; 
I'll sick you with my spitz dog, 
And I'll stab you with blue glass. 
At every evening party 
You'll find me there so hearty, 
I 
never step upon the floor 
Till dancing does begin ; 
I 
dance in latest fashion, 
My appearance it is dashing; 
They can't resist the figure of 
Charles Chesterfield MeFlynn. 
By-bye, Charlie, etc. 
THE IRISH FAIR. 
Written by W. H. W HITEHEAD, and originally sang by J. U. CosnoT. 
AS

The same day as the Fair, 
All the pretty boys and girls, 
They assembled there. 
There was humped- back McCarty, 
And cork-legged Teddy Lee, 
They were among the party, 
Who rode along with me.

While on the road to the Fair,

Now we're off to Donnybrook, 
For to see the Fair ; 
Won't we have a

With the boys and girls there ! 
We'll dance and sing, and whiskey drink, 
Till our hearts are free from care - 
There's no such . fun, where'er you go, 
As you'll find at an Irish Fair. 
We all went into a 
tavern, 
And there began to sing, 
And Judy O'Brien and Mickey Flinn, 
They done a 
double fling. 
And then they got a-fighting, 
You couldn't hold them back,

MeCarty's head he cracked.

On the road while driving, 
The crowd sung songs so sweet, 
And big fat Lizzie McCarty, 
Shure she broke down the seat.

I

At McCarty on his hump.

LAST week my wife said : " Arthur dear, 
I 
should so like a 
change, 
It's rather dull for me at home, 
Now couldn't you arrange, 
To meet me after business hours, 
And then you know we might, 
Just have a 
little dinner, dear, 
And go somewhere at night ?" 
SPOKEN.—Why, certainly, my popsey wopsey, we will. 
So, meeting with my old friend Brovp, he being a 
very 
jolly fellow, advised me to take her to see Pink Dominoes, 
'twill make you roar! It did, with rage! for ever since 
he has done nothing but sing— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, you've settled me for life, 
And why did I 
not see you first before I 
took my wife ? 
She says she's found me out, and in my face she throws 
All the naughty things they do in Pink Dominoes! 
He thought he look'd a 
guilty wretch, 
While everybody roar'd, 
He chew'd his programme into pulp, 
He felt so very bored ; 
His wife she sat like all the rest, 
Laughing at the fun, 
Says she, " How could you bring me here, 
To show me how ' tis done ?" 
SPOKEN.—So, that's the way you deceive your poor wife, 
is it ? sending false telegrams, and false letters, like that 
wicked fellow in the play ! and ever since he has been 
singing— 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, etc. 
Now should that author cross my path, 
I'll make him use his pen, 
To write a 
big apology, 
To all the married men ; 
And as for Brown, the horrid. wretch, 
The cause of all my woes, 
I 
will be sure to pay him out, 
And give him awful blows! 
SPOKEN. —NO, I 
won't, I'll buy two orchestra tickets, 
and send them to his wife, then perhaps he will have oc-
casion to sing— 
Oh, Pink Dominoes, etc.

While rambling to-night o'er the lea, 
And said, as he kiss'd me good-bye, 
Wear this in your breast, love, for me.

While lonely I 
sigh for my darling's bright eye, 
Of my pretty red rose I 
will sing!

I'll sing of my pretty red rose ! 
'Tis a 
dear little mem'ry of love, 
How sad that it soon must decay, 
But fondly I'll treasure its leaves 
Tho' their beauty may vanish away. 
Sweet moments of joy it recalls, 
And lulls ey'ry sigh to repose ; 
Tho' now we're apart, still my true lover's heart 
Seems to dwell in my pretty red rose!

can't, 
And so I 
don't intend; 
The darling lived at a 
bonnet-shop, 
In a 
street at the West-end; 
I've stood so long in front of it, 
Her form to gaze upon, 
That once or twice a " bobby's " come, 
And told me to move on. 
Naughty Mary Ann, &c. 
She used to work there all the day, 
And then go home at night; 
I 
used to 'scort her to the door, 
Which I 
thought such delight; 
I've told her how I 
loved her more 
Than a 
miser loved his gold; 
And I've waited for her in the rain, 
And caught a 
dreadful cold. 
Naughty Mary Ann, &c. 
With her dad I 
used to smoke my pipe, 
And I'd drink tea with her mother; 
frwas settled in a 
month we should 
Belong to one another: 
So I 
bought the ring, and, full of joy, 
To see her went one day, 
When they said a 
soldier'd been and gone, 
And taken her away. 
Naughty Mary Ann, dic. 
She'd known this soldier chap some time, 
Though she'd vowed to be my wife; 
I 
hopes if ever he goes to the wars, 
They'll frighten him out of his life 
For he and she have ruined me; 
I'm a 
poor unhappy man; 
Bad luck to all false females, and 
Bad luck to Mary Ann. 
Naughty Mary Ann, ate..

I 
TOOK my girl one day, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name. 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare; 
And one and all around her did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma, 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go 
I 
ask'd them what they meant ? 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye. 
Emma began to scream! 
" 
Oh, Fred, what does this mean ?" 
I 
ask'd again, and this was their reply— 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police 1" 
And when he came he look'd at me so sly. 
The crowd then at me laugli'd, 
And said I 
must be " daft ;" 
And once again they all commenc'd to cry---
Oh! Emma, etc. 
An old man said to me, 
"Why, young man, can't you see 
The joke ?" and I 
look'd at him with surprise f 
He said, " don't be put out, 
It's a 
saying's got about ;" 
And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies. 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
THE LABORERS. 
sung by KERNELL and BRADLEY, at the Eagle Theatre. 
WE'RE employed upon the Public Works, 
So listen to our ditty ; 
We'll tell you of the trouble we had 
To get work in the city ; 
We've searched for work up at the pipes, 
And down at the Navy Yard; 
But the only job we got at last 
Was up on the boulevard. 
We're solid with all the aldermen, 
We hold a 
grip in the ward ; 
We have thirty-five relations 
Upon the boulevard. 
Our captain was a 
solid man, 
his name was Mike Mahoney; 
On a 
packet ship he crossed the sea, 
lie came from California; 
A 
politician he arose to be, 
For us be had a 
regard, 
And he had us all appointed 
Beyant at the boulevard. 
We're solid, etc. 
Soon, we know, we'll be discharged, 
Election is returning, 
And for the money we've worked so hard, 
Our pocket sure is burning ; 
The boss he told us all to go, 
We thought it very hard, 
So Mahoney and me and my chums did agree 
To leave the boulevard. 
We're solid, etc.

I'm going to wed a 
nice young lass, 
In beauty none can her surpass; 
You may search the country all around, 
You'll not find one like Susan Brown. 
Oh, I 
love Sue, and Sue loves me, 
We're happier than king or queen can be, 
But Sue, you must know, has a 
curious way, 
For when I 
go to kiss her she will always say— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dear me, let me be, get away, do, 
Oh, don't tickle me, now then, Ted, stop your chaff, 
lie, he, he, he, 
Oh, you make me laugh I 
I 
never shall the day forget, 
The first time I 
and Susan met, 
She was milking on a 
three legg'd stool; 
I 
call'd her duck, she called me fool ; 
She then gave me such a 
slap in the face, 
But I 
didn't mind that for I 
wanted to taste 
Her sweet pretty lips, like the roses so red, 
But when I 
went to kiss her, how she scream'd and said— 
Oh, dear me, etc. 
I 
said I'll have one kiss, and then 
My arm went round her waist again; 
She shouted, " Oh I 
I 
feel so queer," 
She scratched my face and pulled my ear; 
But I 
held fast and declared that I 
Would either have a 
kiss or die ; 
She said, " Well, Ted, if you'll let me be, 
Just take one, duckie darling, but don't tickle me. 
Oh, dear me, etc. 
ENCORE VERSE. 
I'm married now and settled down, 
1With my dear darling Susan Brown ; 
We are happy as a 
pair can be, 
And toss the .babies on our knee; 
But when I 
chance to come home late at night, 
She's bound to catch me, and oh, what a 
plight, 
For Susan don't stop to consider my plea, 
But with a 
pair of fiat-irons she tickles me. 
Oh, dear me, etc. 
THE APOLOGY TO O'REILLY. 
NOT a 
hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this our glorious Union land, 
Is kept a 
first-class liquor stand 
By a 
man whose name's O'Connor. 
There's a 
man who's known both near and far, 
Who attends to Mike O'Connor's bar; 
Who, in our late war received no Acar, 
And his name it is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our banner's starry wave, 
There's not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or half the money for whiskey gave, 
As did McDermott. 
O'Connor's bar-room blazed with light 
On that eventful, bloody night 
That McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With sleeves rolled up McDermott stood, 
And vowed he'd die before he would 
Say the slightest word that could, 
In any manner, be misconstrued 
Into an apology to O'Reilly. 
With a 
frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reilly collared a 
glass of rye, 
Which he devoured without a 
sigh, 
Then turning to McDermott, said, 
" 
You alchoholic vat, you drunken loon 
You've no more sense than a 
gossoon !" 
"Be Heavens ! 
I'll make you change your tune," 
Says McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till o'er his eye a 
shanty rose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
With his head jammed in a 
big spittoon, 
And dreaming of Barnum's big balloon, 
The polio.° came in and collared the gang.

THERE'S one sweet face in all this world, whose smile to 
me is bliss, 
One pretty pair of pouting lips that I 
would love to kiss; 
And this fairy little queen is only seventeen ; 
Her voice is sweetest music, as it floats upon the air ; 
Her style is very neat, and she has such tiny feet, 
And on her dainty finger is a 
sparkling solitaire. 
CHORUS. 
She's deep blue eyes and golden hair! 
With dimpled cheeks and face so fair ; 
She's a 
queen among the bon- tons, 
Is this lovely millionaire, 
Upon her dainty finger is a 
sparkling solitaire! 
(Dance.) 
One moonlight night I 
whisper'd love into her willing 
ear, 
She blush'd and nestled to my side, and brush'd away a 
tear, 
While my brain was in a 
whirl I 
kiss'd this darling girl ; 
We sat for hours so happy, and she said my lot she'd share, 
And then we did agree that next week we'd married be, 
And on her dainty finger is a 
sparkling solitaire. 
She's deep blue eyes, etc. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Am.—" Martha Jane Barew." 
Written for HARRY KERNELL by E. McCully:. 
Tnr.nE was a 
man named Pat McCann, 
He courted a 
girl named Mary Ann, 
He loved her very dearly, yes, he loved her as his life, 
He dressed so gay on Patrick's day— 
He popped the question right away— 
And asked this little darling if she would he his wife; 
Oh, to cry then she began right before this handsome man 
"" 
says she, " 
you're the biuffest blarney 
I 
met in all my life," said Mary Ann to Pat McCann ; 
" 
Go away from me, you naughty man, 
Or else I 
will tell my mother, and she'll surely have your life." 
CHO a 
us • 
Oh, handsome Pat McCann loved his purty Mary Ann, 
Every evening he would take her out a- walking, 
He would buy her an oyster stew and molasses candy, 
And the way he used to kiss her was so shocking. 
Said Pat McCann to Mary Ann, " You are my darling jewel, 
And if you will not accept my hand I'll go and end my life." 
Said Mary Ann to Pat McCann, 
" 
I 
love you more than any man, 
And rather than refuse your hand I'll be your loving wife." 
11, he bought her then the ring, 
And many another puny thing ; he bought her silks and saliva 
Enough to last her life; and although it was Lent 
To church they went to ask the father 
For his consent to marry this loving couple, 
And make them man and wife. 
Oh, handsome Pat, etc. 
Now Pat McCann and Mary Ann 
Are as happy as salt water clams ; 
The ding a 
couple in all the land 
With hearts so full of joy, for some time last spring 
A 
little thing dropped in one day to hear Pat sing, 
It's nice to be the father of a 
bouncing baby boy; 
Now they're like turtle doves, 
They are happy in their loves, 
All cares and sorrows are unknown, all troubles they defy; 
I 
wish my name was Pat McCann, 
You would be my Mary Ann; 
I 
would hug and kiss you, darling, and be married by and by. 
Oh, handsome Pat. eta.

FACES that I

Miss the eyes that once were bright. 
Oh, how fondly I 
remember 
One who said she loved me so ; 
While the flitting visions bring me 
Shadows of the long ago. 
CHORUS. 
Faces that I 
used to cherish, 
Lips that whispered soft and low, 
Come in flitting visions to me 
Shadows of the long ago. 
Voices that so fondly mingled 
Now are silent as the tomb; 
And I 
miss the merry maidens— 
Miss their cheeks of rosy bloom. 
Now and then a 
something tells me 
Of a 
heart that had its woe ; 
And the flitting visions bring me 
Shadows of the long ago. 
Faces that, etc. 
Ringlets that were bright as sunshine 
Float no longer on the breeze ; 
And I 
miss the loving kisses— 
Miss my darling ' neath the trees. 
Oft 1 
think I 
bear her calling, 
Where the brooklets gently flow ; 
And the flitting visions bring me 
Shadows of the long ago.

PARADE OF THE A. 0. H. 
Written for HARRY K ERNELL by G. A. McCuany. 
Aix.—" Connemara Coockoos." 
I'm a 
gay young chap from Erin and they call me Dandy Put, 
I 
wear a 
green regalia, a 
harp, and shamrock in my hat; 
I 
joined the Ancient Order; we're the boys that looked so gay 
When we marched in the procession on last St. Patrick's day, 
And oh, such music, such music, such music as we had all day, 
Such music, such music, how sweet the bands did play. 
ITugh Maainnis was chief marshal and he rode a 
fine white horse, 
With a 
sword and sash beside him, oh! boys he was the boss ! 
With a 
smile on every feature, and a 
uniform so gay, 
The ladies all smiled on him as AN e 
marched along the way, 
And oh, such winking, such winking, such winking as was 
there that day, 
Such winking, such winking, they winked the livelong day. 
'Twas just below the common we fell into the line, 
With flags and banners flying, the day being nice and fine, 
The band played Garry Owen and then the Mulligan Guard; 
And we carried the harp of Erin beside the stripes and stars. 
And oh, such tramping, such tramping, such tramping as was 
there that day, 
Such tramping, such tramping all through the mud and clay. 
When we marched in open order faith ' twould make you laugh 
to see 
The little stick leg cripple keeping step with Mick Magee; 
When we come before the marshal's house they brought us to 
a 
halt, 
And they gave us just ten minutes for to go and get our malt. 
And oh, such whiskey, such whiskey, such whiskey as was 
drank that day, 
Such whiskey, such whiskey, the bar-rooms made It pay. 
Then when we were disbanded as quick as you could wink 
We all bounced down to Kelley's for to have a 
drop to drink, 
The whiskey punch flew lively for the liquor was so rare, 
In less than fifteen minutes divil a 
sober man was there. 
And oh, such drinking, such drinking, such drinking as was 
there that night, 
Such drinking, such drinking, the boys got awful tight. 
Mike Connors and Pat Cronin then got into a 
dispute, 
Mike said his hat was finest, and Pat slapped him on the snoot, 
Then broken heads were plenty, the blood ran freely there, 
Myself and long Dan Carty had to waltz off on our ear. 
And oh, such fighting, such fighting, such fighting as the boys 
had there, 
Such fighting, such fighting, ' twas like an Irish fair.

SWEET visions of childhood ! how bright they appear 
When our lives are o'erclouded. with care; 
• 
How fondly we dream of them, year after year, 
And how lovely they are, and how fair! 
Oh, bless'd are the scenes that I 
n.e'er can forget: 
Dearest mother, so kind and so true ; 
Sweet home that I 
left with the saddest regret, 
flow my heart fondly turns unto you! 
CHORUS. 
Sweet visions of childhood return to me now, 
And I 
weep for the days that are past; 
My fond mother's kiss, and her hand on my brow, 
In the days that were too bright to last ! 
Sweet visions of childhood ! how dear to each heart, 
Once again by a 
fair mother's knee 
I 
linger while fast welling tears fondly start, 
And the past comes in beauty to me! 
Oh, time may destroy all the bright joy of life, 
But this bosom will ever retain 
Lovely -visions of thee, 'mid the world's busy strife, 
Bringing bliss to this fond heart again! 
Sweet visions, etc. 
COMIC RECITATION. 
WITH due condescension I'd call your attention 
To what I 
shall mention of Erin so green, 
And without hesitation I'll show how that nation 
Became of creation the gem and the queen. 
'Twas early one morning without any warning 
That Vanus was born in the beautiful sea, 
And by the same token and sure ' twas provoking, 
Her pinions were soaking and wouldn't give play. 
Old Neptune, who knew her, began to pursue her, 
In order to woo her—the wicked old Jew— 
And almost had caught her, a 
top of the water, 
Great Jupiter's daughter, which never would do. 
But Jove, the great Janus, looked down and saw Vanus, 
And Neptune so hainous pursuing her wild, 
And he spoke out in thunder, he'd rend him asunder, 
And sure ' twas no wonder for chasing his child. 
A 
star that was flying hard by him espying, 
He caught with small trying, and down let it snap; 
It fell quick as winking on Neptune a-sinking, 
And gave him 
thinking a 
bit of a 
rap. 
That star it was dry land, both lowland and highland, 
And formed a 
sweet island the land of my birth; 
Thus plain is the story, that sent down from glory, 
Old Erin asthore is the gem of the earth. 
Upon Erin nately jumped Vanus so stately, 
But fainted kase lately so hard she was pressed, 
Which much did bewilder, but ere it had killed her, 
Her father distilled her a 
drop of the best. 
That sup was victorious, it made her feel glorious, 
A 
little uproarious I 
fear it might prove; 
So how can you blame us that Ireland's so famous 
For drinking and beauty, for fighting and love.

MRS. CASEY'S RAFFLE. 
Written and sung 
by nARRY KliSZNELL. 
Ir you listen to me for awhile 
I'll tell you a 
tale; 
You all know Mrs. Casey, down 
The street, that sells the ale. 
She gave a 
raffle for a 
stove, 
And to have a 
dance as well; 
And I 
being the floor manager, 
Had tickets for to sell. 
SPOKEN.—Mrs. Casey is a 
particular friend of John McSwe-
gan, and a 
full cousin of William Waterhouse; and her husband 
Sam O'Casey, alias Gas House Sam—( he was once employed in 
the Gas House at sixty dollars a 
month, wheeling smoke out in 
a 
push- cart)—he went to the war as a 
soldier, and never re-
turned, and Mrs. Casey raffled off the old stove. 
CHORUS. 
But oh, what a 
row! I 
will tell it to you now! 
Breaking heads, with slats of the beds; 
McGurn n 
fainted, I 
thought he was dead, 
O'Brien lost his hat, what do you think of that 7 
Mrs. O'Leary lost her hoops at Casey's raffle! 
Now, in came John MeTntee, 
Along with Rodger Dunbar; 
When up jumped O'Brien, the fiddler, 
And says, this is going too far. 
But before he had time to open his month, 
He was lying on the floor; 
And I 
like a 
fighting man, 
Busted through the door. 
SPOKEN.—Be,gorra, I 
never saw such a 
fracas in my born 
days before. 
Whin they knocked O'Brien down, he bawled out 
for Nixey, and cheese it; and they came in with billy-jacks and 
knocked every body down that came in reach 
of them. 'And 
Nancy McGowan got excited and jumped clear out of a 
pull-
back dress. 
But oh! what a 
row, etc. 
The raffling then did commence, 
As you may understand; 
McGtiffin threw forty-four, 
And O'Donnell called his hand. 
But, Mrs. Casey got vexed then, 
And ordered thim all out; 
When the fiddler played Patrick's day, 
Then you had ought to hear them shout.

AIRS. 
CASEY'S RAFFLE.—Concluded. 
SPOIKEN.—SUCh shouting you never beard in your life; but 
when the supper was announced, everything became quiet. 
They had a 
splendid supper. 
There was mackerel and ice-
cream, and molasses and oysters. 
John Bradley went to wait 
on the ladies. 
He asked one girl what she would have I Says 
she, '' 1 
will have quail.' Says John, " You will have bean 
soup, or you will give your seat to Biddy Doyle." 
Another 
young girl wanted an egg dropped on toast; says John, " You 
will get some old hen to drop it, or you will not get it here to-
night." 
Then Bermidas Conklin wanted to make a speech. 
Says he, " Would I 
were an eagle, that I 
might fly over the sea 
and spread the liberty of my country !" 
Says Jim Kelly, " Sit 
down; you would be shot for a 
goose before you got half way." 
But it was

row, etc. 
TITRE'S A BOTTLE ON THE MANTLE. 
AUL—" Letter in the Candle." 
THERE'S a 
bottle on the mantle, 
But it don't belong to me ; 
If I 
could only smell the flavor, 
How happy I 
would be. 
But I 
dare not approach it, 
For fear some one would come in; 
6ut I 
would like to take a 
snifter, 
For I 
know it's full of gin. • 
Small drop of gin, 
To wet my fiery tongue; 
I 
loved you since my childhood, 
Many songs of you I 
have sung. 
Oh ! how sadly I 
remember, 
it was two short months ago ; 
I 
had a 
bully lunch route, 
But they took me down below. 
They said I 
was a 
vagarant— 
And I 
think it was a 
sin 
To lock me in a 
dungeon, 
And deprive me of my gin. 
Small drop of gin, etc.

BIDDY THE BALLET GIRL 
Written by J. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by JACK CONROY, 
every evening, at GILL'S, 15 West Houston street. 
I 
AM a 
gay laboring man, 
And I have a 
beautiful daughter, 
Who never did care much for work, 
It's her mother's own wish that she aughter; 
It seems that she fancied the stage, 
So I granted her final request, 
And now she's a 
beautiful dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CIIORTTS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarty ; 
She brings home at night, and at matinees, 
Large baskets of flowers, and also bouquets. 
Oh, she is my only daughter, 
And I 
am the man that taught her 
To wear spangled clothes, and go round on her toes, 
And there is no such a 
girl as Biddy. 
When salary day does arrive, 
All trouble and toil it does smother, 
For, just the day before that there was a 
kick, 
The girl had been scolded by her mother ; 
She's courting a 
clerk in the bank, 
Who sees her safe home at the door, 
And pays a 
big gang in the gallery, 
To applaud in a 
perfect uproar. 
On the stage, etc. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid ; 
I thought I would go to the theatre, 
And take the old woman along; 
In the parquette in front I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance, 
My son Danny was up in the tier; 
He cried, " Go in, sister Biddy," 
When they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage, etc.

-W HERE the water lilies grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly flow, 
Meet me, darling Annie 1 
"When the whippoorwill cloth 
And the dewdrops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kiss me, darling Annie ! 
CHORUS. 
When the flowers fall asleep, 
And the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I 
your heart may keep, 
Then, my darling Annie ! 
Harken to the turtle dove, 
Cooing from his nest above, 
List'ning to the tale of love, 
Whisper'd unto Annie 
How he envies me the bliss, 
Pressing such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie ! 
When the flowers, etc. 
While the little stars do shine, 
Place your snowy hand in mine, 
Whisper softly, " 
be thine," 
Now, my darling Annie ! 
Front the clouds the moonbeams break, 
Show'ring silver o'er the lake, 
List'uing to the vows I 
take, 
From you, darling Annie ! 
When the flowers, etc. 
THE RISING POLITICIAN. 
Written and sung by BARRY BENNETT. 
Goon evening to ye all, 
I've come to make a 
call, 
And tell ye of in 
victory 
Upon election day. 
I 
ran for alderman, 
And Murphy was the man 
Who tried hard to defeat me, 
But he gave himself away ; 
He never tried repeatin', 
And that's the way I 
beat him— 
I 
voted seven times myself 
In the ould Fourth Ward so gay. 
cnoncs. 
Now I'm a 
politician, 
I 
hold a 
high position 
I 
gained by repetition 
Upon election day. 
I 
took the gang around 
Where the free lunch could be found, 
And many 's the plate of soup, my boys, 
Did they put out of sight; 
We swept the district clean, 
And the di vii such a 
scene 
Was known in New York city, boys, 
Upon election night ; 
Cigar signs, barrels, boards we burned 
When the victory it was earned 
It gave me satisfaction and 
It filled me wid delight. 
Now I'm a 
politician, etc. 
And now I'll tell to you 
What I 
am going to (lo ; 
I'll not forget the workingmen, 
To them I 
will be true ; 
They shall have eight hours a 
day, 
And a 
fair amount of pay, 
And live as well as those big bugs 
Upon Fifth Avenue ; 
Sure I'll improve the city, 
For I 
think it is a 
pity 
That poor men should be starving 
When there's public work to do. 
CHORU S. 
So let ye all be merry, 
And don't ye vote contrary, 
And I 
will show ye, one and all, 
What an Irishman can do.

SOME one's watching at the window, 
Where the people hurry by, 
List'ning for a 
well-known footstep, 
With a 
bright and eager eye. 
For they cherish still a 
promise 
Of a 
heart they know is true, 
Who has whisper'd, " love, to-morrow 
I 
will come again to you." 
CIIOPXS. 
Some one's watching at the window, 
With their face against the pane I 
Some one's softly sweetly saying, 
" 
Will he, will he come again ?" 
Some one's growing very weary, 
As the moments come and go ; 
Where the wayward one is wand'ring 
They would dearly like to know. 
Surely he can never linger 
From my side so long and late, 
When he knows the sweetest welcome 
Here his coming cloth await. 
Some one's, etc. 
Sonic one's dreaming of the story, 
Ever new and ever old, 
That they long to hear repeated, 
Tho' it often has been told ; 
They are from the past recalling 
All their many dreams of bliss, 
Hearing not the footsteps falling, 
Till they're startled with a 
kiss.

CAST. 
Alderman Sadder  
Alderman Levy  
Street in Second Grooves. 
Both ALDERMEN meet each other; shake hands. 
ALDERMAN LEVY. Good morning, Alderman Sneider. 
I 
ain't had the pleasure of seeing you in a 
long time. 
Where 
have you been ? 
ALDERMAN SNEIDER. I 
was on to Washington to see the Presi-
dent. 
LEVY. How is he ? 
SNEIDER. Useless as ever; he was asking for you. 
LEVY. Yes ! I 
owe him four dollars. 
But I 
say, Alderman, 
what is your prospects of the coming election ? 
SNEIDER. Well, I think if they don't knock down that tene-
ment house on Cherry street, 1'11 win by a 
large majority. 
How do you stand, .Alderman 1 
LEVY. Oh, I 
got everything in my favor so far; my oppo-
nent don't talk to no one in his district. 
SNEIDER. HOW is that ? 
LEVY. They are all deaf and dumb, 
SNEIDER. I'll never go into McGovern's as long as I 
live again. 
Now what do you think he done to me awhile ago ? 
I 
went in 
there to get a 
glass of brandy. I 
felt hind of cold ; just because 
I 
poured the tumbler full, he handed the a 
towel and a 
bar of 
soap, before a 
crowd of people, sayina, " here, take a 
bath !" 
LEVY. I 
will endeavor to have his place turned into a 
shoot-
ing gallery.

Funny Old Gal !" 
HERE we are, two aldermen, 
And we're solid with all the gang ; 
Whenever we walk out in the street 
We take off our hats to all we meet.

CHORES . 
Let all of you vote for us aldermen, 
Mike McCarty and Tom McCann ; 
Next election we will run, 
And hope we'll come out Number One. 
TWO ALDERMEN .—Concluded. 
Don't forget and vote for us, 
And never fear no fight or muss, 
And if you're ever put, in jail, 
You can bet your life we'll go your bail. 
Let all, etc. 
We can put you on the boulevard, 
Or carrying water for the Skidmore Guard; 
At a 
political job you can have a 
lark, 
Chasing flies out of Central Park. 
Let all, etc. 
Bung with great success by NERNELL and BRADLEY. 
HERE you see two brave police, 
Trying hard for to keep the peace, 
And looking out for every place 
That is upon our beat; 
At twelve o'clock, when we turn out, 
The other platoon turns in ; 
It's then we get our orders' 
For to squash the whiskey ring. 
ClIORUS. 
Look out, boys, don't you make a 
noise! 
And mind that you don't be talking loud; 
For if you do we.have something here 
That will scatter most any crowd. 
Our captain is a 
very fine man, 
He always lets us go about ; 
He tells us keep our eyes well skinned 
On New York tramps and scouts; 
We have searched the city through and through, 
Looking for a 
horse, 
And a 
second-handed hand- cart 
ALd a 
big bull dog was lost. 
Look out, boys, etc.

'Tis twenty years ago to- day 
Since we stood side by side, 
But still I 
see the face I 
loved, 
The maid I 
used to chide ; 
The eve we said the last " good- night," 
I 
plucked the nearest rose, 
And placed it in her shining hair 
To find a 
sweet repose. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis twenty years ago to-day 
Since we stood side by side, 
But still I 
see the face I 
loved, 
The maid I 
used to chide. 
I 
bade her keep the fragrant flow'r 
Till we again should meet, 
And then I'd ask her heart and hand 
While kneeling at her feet ; 
But when I 
came to seek my love, 
My darling, sweet and fair, 
I 
only found the withered rose 
That nestled in her hair. 
'Tis twenty years, etc. 
She left for Eden's lovely shore, 
When I 
was far away, 
And angels bore her spirit on, 
Where it is always day ; 
The rose, tho' withered, old and dry, 
Reminds me of the past, 
And when I 
part with all I 
love, 
Her rose will be the last. 
'Tis twenty years, etc.

CALL me your darling again, 
And give me the smile I 
adore, 
Say that I 
love not in vain, 
Oh, keep me in sorrow no more 
Shadows are stealing around me, 
And deep in my heart there's a 
pain; 
0, come to my side and caress me, 
And call me your darling again ; 
Come to my side and caress me, 
And call me your darling again. 
'Whisper your sweet words of love, 
And banish my heart's weary sighs ; 
Pure as the bright stars above 
Is the love-light that dwells in your eyes 
Tell me there's joy for the morrow, 
To thee ever true I'll remain. 
0, wake, love, from silence and sorrow, 
And call me your darling again; 
Wake, love, from silence and sorrow, 
And call me your darling again. 
ALDERMAN FLYNN. 
Written by GEORGE THATCHER, the great Ethiopian Comedian. 
I 
GUES S 
you have heard of fighting, (Symp.) 
Now, that's what I 
delight in; (Symp.) 
As I 
go down the street, boys, 
With my sword drawn in my band, 
I 
march to the tune of the Mulligan Guards, 
As played by the Irish band. 
CHORUS . 
There's Alderman Flynn, what do you think of him "I 
He is elected now by a 
thousand solid men; 
And the boys all shout when I 
turn out, 
Hurrah, for Alderman Flynn ! 
I 
am pet,of all the ladies, (
Symp.) 
I 
am fond of all the babies; (Symp.) 
My appearance is engaging— 
It is upon my word. 
I 
expect to be a 
solid man 
Over all the wards. 
There's Alderman Flynn, etc. 
I 
thought I'd go to the army, (Symp.) 
I 
thought the bullets wouldn't harm me; (Symp.) 
I 
went to go to the rear one day, for to get cup of tea, 
,When a 
cannon ball come, 
And hit me in the thumb, 
And knocked the leg off me. 
SPOREN.—When I 
came home a 
wounded hero it was differ-
ent. 
They wanted me to grind an organ on the corners; they 
said one good turn deserves another, and now the boys say 
when they see me— 
CHORD'S. 
Alderman Flynn, with his dizzy shin, 
That hat he wears has been called ins; 
And they all do shout when I 
turn out, 
There's dizzy Alderman Flynn.

McGEE was a 
jolly old cobbler, 
lie came from the divil knows where ; 
Of whiskey, he was a 
great gobbler, 
And delighted to go on a " tare." 
He was often persuaded to alter 
His habits, and live like a 
man ; 
But whenever he tried, he would falter, 
And go back to his bottle and can. 
CHORUS. 
McGee was a 
terrible man, 
He was always so flighty and frist-v ; 
He tried to reform, but he couldn't keep warm,. 
Sure, he'd die if he hadn't, his whiskey. 
His wife was a 
dacent ould woman, 
And scolded from mornin' till night ; 
She told him he must be inhuman 
To he keeping them in such a 
plight. 
He would listen in scorn and derision, 
And drink just as much as before ; 
Till at length she gave out her decision 
To begin on a 
temperance war. 
She went to a 
temperance preacher 
And stated the case of McGee ; 
He promised to help the poor creature— 
" 
I'll go over next morn in','' says he. 
When he came, the old cobbler was roaring 
A 
song, with his glass in his hand ; 
'Twas the glass he was fond of adoring, 
And he seemed hardly able to stand ! 
McGee was, etc. 
" 
Dear Misther McGee," said his rev'renee, 
" 
I 
hope you ‘
vill alter your ways ; 
I've come now to pive you deliverance 
From the evil that's bliciliting your days !" 
" 'Pon rue sowl !'' says McGee, " I 
am ready, 
I'll stop with the greatest of cheer ; 
But I 
fear I 
can never be steady 
While a 
dhrop of good whiskey is near." 
McGee was, etc. 
A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE.—Concluded. 
" 
Fear not," said the man of cold water, 
" 
You'll show us how good you can be ; 
The demon of drink we will slaughter, 
And we'll honor the name of McGee." 
Then he promised to keep at a 
distance 
All drinks cf whatever degree ; 
" 
Noble man, you shall have our assistance 
In a 
week the result we will see." 
McGee was, etc. 
SPoKE:5.—The reverend gentleman, after some further per-
suasions, took his departure, and Mr. McGee at once became a 
strict disciple of temperance. 
The sudden change of life bad a 
severe effect upon him ; he lost all his exuberant spirits, be-
ing entirely under the control of his wife and the temperance 
advocates, who filled his mind every day with solemn lectures, 
and worked him into such a 
queer state—half comfort, half de-
spair—that he would often say to himself, " Begob, l'm not 
meself at all !" 
At last they induced him to state in a public 
meeting the various benefits he had derived from his adherence 
to the pledge—the comfort, the happiness, the great joy and 
peace of mind he had experienced during his short season of 
sobriety 
lie attended the meeting, and with a 
very grave 
countenaAme, related his experience as follows: 
REcurkTiox. 
Qood people, I 
stand here before you to-night, 
Me mouth very dhry, and me head very light ; 
It's three weeks to-day since I 
joined in the ranks 
Of the Wather Brigade, I 
left off me ould pranks! 
And ever since then, sure, me life has been blessed 
With a 
great many comforts, and nights of good rest. 
I 
paid all tric, debts, and I 
bought a 
new gown 
For the wife of me bosom—a 
beautiful brown— 
I 
took from the pawn shop me foin Sunday coat, 
Which cost me last winter a 
ten do.6ar note, 
And put a 
new sole on the mild woman's shoes— 
A 
moiffhty big job, for she wears " twinty-two's 1" 
I 
made a 
new sty for the fine little pigs, 
And fixed up the garden with bushes and twigs ; 
1 
wint to a 
lawyer and made out my will, 
My duty to all I 
was bound to fulfill. 
And yesterday mornin' (don't think that I'm scoffin'), 
I 
bought for me body an ill4,r,ant coffin ! 
For I 
know if my whiskey is taken from me, 
You'll very soon make a 
dead man of McGee. 
McGee was, etc.

SQUANDERING COIN. 
Sung by G. II. MAcnimmorr. 
I'm one of those fellows who's always all there, 
My maxim's to act if I 
can on the square; 
Of money I'm flush—pounds, shillings and pence 
I 
hurl to the winds, and don't, care for expense; 
My horses, my hounds, and my clubs and my wine, 
And jewels for women both costly and fine 
To me are but nothing, and bank- notes but trash, 
To a 
swell whose main object is squandering cash. 
CHORUS. 
Squandering coin from morn till night, 
Squandering coin is my delight, boys ; 
In spending your cash now with me join, 
My great amusement, is squandering coin. 
At morning I 
rise and go out on the spree, 
For a 
lark never ceases with fellahs like me, 
And only when I 
am asleep in my bed 
That I 
really am quiet, can it truly be said ; 
Whatever's expensive directly I 
try, 
At three shillings a 
dozen my oysters I 
buy ; 
On the races I 
bet, and don't care what I'm at, 
And you'll soon squander thousands on folly like that. 
Squandering coin, etc. 
I've tried speculation, drink naught but champagne 
At Baden my hundreds I've staked on the main ; 
I've run up accounts at both Hobby's and Poole's, 
Arid squandered alike among sharpers and fools. 
But still I'm so rich that whatever I 
spend, 
My fortune's not likely to come to an end ; 
I 
never smoke cheaper than shilling ciaars, 
And at music halls always stand treat for the stars. 
Squandering coin, etc. 
But stop—I 
have hit it—I've thouryht of a 
way 
To get rid of my cash in a 
very quick way ; 
No matter how much any man may possess, 
A wife will soon spend it in jewels and dress. 
So, boys, as I 
cannot get rid of my pelf, 
I'll marry, and then let my wife help herself; 
For what you don't give her she's sure to purloin, 
Get married—your spouse will soon squander the coin.
