Dear Bess:
 
I enjoyed your Alabama visit immensely,  and feel renewed and energized
 
to face an incredibly busy few months coming up.
 
Your contact in Charlottesville for servicing your recording machine is:
 
Hall Electronics,  Inc.
 
1305-F Seminole Trail
 
Charlottesvilla, VA  22905
 
804/974-6466
 
You might ask for Alan Williams and say he was recommended by Anne Kimzey.
 
Enclosed is the copy of the nice Washington Post feature on you.
 I've
 
made copies and circulated them and thought you might want your original back.
 
I hope to see you next week when I' m in Washington.
 
Sincerely,
 
Henry Willett
 
Director

It's n
ow a
 
s

ut t

o my mother
 
decided t

aught me Latin a

ut s
he a

he
 
day-to-day t
h
ings.  She t
aught me h

But t
hen I
 had t
o l
earn h
ow t
o do i
t
 r
i

 g
reat
 
believer i
n doing t
h
ings r
i
ght. She gave me a Latin motto (
she gave
 
a
l
l o
f u
s c
hildren d

ine was "
Faciendo ediscere
 
f

nd s
he would t

by dancing y
ou l
earn t

b
y s

 l
earned h

t

fter  s
he and f
ather had f

and -
- w

 would s

nd t

hen I
 h
ad t
o
 
l
earn h
ow t

- because t
hat's what a

- a

Because every November, my mother a
nd I
 would go t
o t
he d
ime
 
s
tore downtown and I
 would get t
o p
ick o
ut t
he p
resents I
 was going
 
t
o make f
or Christmas., s
ecretly,.when s
he wasn't l
ooking.  I
n t
hose
 
days y
ou could b
uy d
resser s

r t
able napkins o
r b
r
idge t
able
 
c
overs t
hat had designs s
tencilled o
n t

embroidering was t
o c
over t
hose b

rench k
nots a
nd
 
l

o t

t would
 
t
urn out t
o be a s
pecial p
resent t
hat y
ou y
ourself h
ad p
ut t
ogether.
 
So a
fter I
 had  p
icked o
ut t
he t
h
ings I
 wanted t
o embroider f
or my
 
s
ister o
r my mother o
r my a
unts, I
 would go t
o t

t
hread counter and p
ick o
ut t
he c
olors. That was t
he best part. There
 
was a
lways white embroidery t

here, I
 r
emember, a
nd l
o
ts o
f
 
pastels -
- pale g

ink, l
avender, y
ellow, pale b
lue, a
nd
 
s

a
gonized. I
 n
ever had enough money f
or a
l
l t
he c

 wanted. One
 
y
ear I
 r
emember c
oming h
ome w
ith r
ed a
nd b
lack a
nd l
i
ght g
reen and
 
p
ink and l
avender, and my o
lder s
ister s

Honey, y
ou don't want
 
t
o u
se t
hat r
ed and b
lack. They won't b
lend. You want i
t
 t
o b
lend and
 
be p
retty."  And I
 t
hought i
t m
ight be p
retty, b
ut I
 t
r
ied i
t
, a
nd i
t
 
wasn't. I
t
 d
idn't b
lend, and I
 had t
o p
ick i
t
 a
l
l o
ut a
nd s
tart a
gain.
 
Now when I
 r
emember what was i
n o
ullragbag -
- s

rom my
 
d

he s

nd b

Dear Bess:
 
I want  to  thank  you  for  the  time  you  gave  me  for  the
 
interview.
 I enjoyed  talking  to  you  and  found  the  entire
 
experience very inspiring.
 
I am including a copy of the article I wrote and I only wish
 
I was allowed more space by "Ethnoforum."
 You talked about
 
many important things,  but because of space constraints only
 
a fraction was reflected in the article.
 
Sincerely,
 
Laura Larco

INTERVIEW WITH BESS LOMAX HAWES
 
BY LAURA LARCO
 
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AT COLLEGE PARK
 
3/13/92
 
Bess Lomax Hawes is retiring as Director of the Folks Arts Program
 
of the National  Endowment for the Arts.
 She has worked  in this
 
position  since  1977  and  has  been  instrumental
 in  promoting
 
traditional arts and the multi-cultural heritage of this country.
 
Among the most important achievements under her leadership are the
 
establishment  of  the  National  Heritage  Awards,  the  folk  arts
 
network
 between  the
 states
 and
 federal
 government
 and  the
 
apprenticeship program.
 
Bess  Lomax  Hawes  was  trained  as  a folklorist.
 She  sometimes
 
accompanied her father John and brother Alan on field trips,  but
 
she  stated  that..."I've  always  been  more
 interested
 in  the
 
implications  and  trying  to  understand  the  importance  of  these
 
traditional expressions than necessarily going out and collecting
 
them myself... though I think you learn a lot in that process."  She
 
began her professional career as a researcher for the Archive of
 
American Folk Song at the Library of Congress,  at the time under
 
the direction of her father  (1937-38); this was followed by a job
 
in the Music Division of the New York Public Library (1941-43); and
 
as Assistant Director of the Music Department of the Office of War
 
Information in New York (1943-46).  During these years she was also
 
a performer with the "Almanac Singers"  and met her husband Butch
 
Hawes who was brother to one of the singers.  During the Depression
 
years  the  family moved to Boston where Mr.  Hawes had better  job
 
offers.
 Bess took care of their three children and started going
 
to  the  nurseries  to  teach  folk  songs.
 Soon  other  mothers  were
 
coming and taking lessons from Bess in singing, guitar,  and banjo.
 
This was pretty much in "Ruth Seeger's pattern... she did the same
 
when her children were small."
 
The Hawes  family moved to California where  Bess  taught  for many
 
years,
 and  in  1975  she  went  to  Washington  to  work  at  the
 
Smithsonian
 (1975-77).
 She  was  then  hired  by  the  National
 
Endowment
 for
 the  Arts  where,
 along  with
 Dan
 Sheehy,
 she
 
administered an impressive network of folk arts programs around the
 
country.
 Bess  Hawes  noted  that  the  main  objective  was  to
 
professionalize the state programs.
 She expressed regret that the
 
younger generation of graduates is not taking advantage of the job
 
opportunities  offered..."you  could  work  with  the  Choctaws,  you
 
could  go work with the  Delta,  you  could work with  the  Northern
 
Appalachians up there... there is a major Chinese community and a
 
major Vietnamese community..."
 
One the biggest challenges to ethnomusicologists she added,  is the
 
issue of multiculturalism.
 There is a growing number of renowned
 
world artists  from Asia and Africa who are now residents  of the
 
United States and "nobody is paying attention to them."
 There is
 
great reluctance from academics to get involved and help some of
 
these people "whose product we depend on fo
 our livelihood... if
 
these people stop making music .
.. we would lo ose our jobs .
.. I think
 
we owe some pay-back... 1
1  
Bess is slowly getting used to the idea of retirement.
 She kept on
 
talking about "us" and "our projects."
 Her interest in the field
 
"is just as great and I intend to do some writing...I will probably
 
do  some  speeches  and  things  like  that..."
 She  said  that  her
 
relationship to the field will be different.
 She can be "a little
 
more outspoken" about what she thinks as she is no longer attached
 
to a federal agency.
 She will not be representing a policy,  she
 
will now be representing herself.

On behalf of the Department of Afro-American Studies,  I extend
 
sincere appreciation for your candid and thorough appraisal of
 
the work of Dr.  William H.  Wiggins,  Jr.,  our current candidate
 
for promotion to the rank of Professor.
 In view of your busy
 
schedule,  we realize it represented a considerable sacrifice of
 
precious time to respond.
 Your contribution was most helpful in
 
our deliberations.
 Please let us know if we can be of service to
 
you in any way in the future.

TOWARD A NEW AMERICAN SENSIBILITY
 
"There is something in the contemplation of the mode in which
 
America has been settled,  that,  in a noble breast,  should
 
forever extinguish the prejudices of national dislikes.
 
Settled by the peoples of all nations,  all nations may claim
 
her for their own.
 You cannot spill a drop of American blood
 
without spilling the blood of the whole world . . . we are
 
not a narrow tribe . . . no:
 our blood is as the flood of
 
the Amazon, made up of a thousand noble currents all pouring
 
into one.
 We are not a nation,  so much as a world."
 
Herman Melville,  Redburn 
We are a young nation.
 
We have and will continue to come from every corner and
 
society of the earth.
 
Not all of us have come willingly,  nor have we arrived at the
 
same time.
 
To this day we still find our way from the places of our
 
birth and the places of unfinished dreams to try our best in
 
this land.
 
In our coming to this place we call the United States of
 
America, we have not come empty handed.
 We have moved into
 
the building of this society loaded with the assumptions of
 
the nations and cultures we left.
 
Two hundred years after the signing of the Bill of Rights we
 
must finally accept that this place was not empty when we
 
came,  and be strong enough to say that we have too often
 
built this nation out of an ethos destructive to some of our
 
people and their cultures.
 
It is time to realign the inequities of the past.
 As we move
 
forward in this realignment we search for those lessons of
 
the past which will support and bring wisdom to our journey.
 
Standing on the precipice of a new century,  this land is
 
emerging as a truly heterogeneous country.
 Each American
 
exists in one or more complex communities of their heritage
 
or choice, while simultaneously existing in an "American
 
culture" that is neither wholly distinct nor consensual.
 The
 
temptation to over-simplify this complex reality must be
 
rejected.

We seek many pathways where the new,  the old,  the hybrid,  can
 
negotiate without causing the extermination of the other.
 
We seek the protection of a society of multiple voices.
 And
 
to that end we seek a new threshold of anxiety where alarm
 
would be triggered by any representation,  any discussion,  any
 
evaluation,  any standard,  and distribution of resources,  any
 
accumulation of resources,  not achieved through the
 
negotiation of voices from multiple positions.
 
We seek a community where mechanisms of cultural policy are
 
constructed to assist and protect a natural rhythm where
 
life,  evolution,  death,  and rebirth serve the whole and the
 
part -- the local,  the regional,  the national body -- woman,
 
man,  child,  e ld er.  
We seek a future wherein the seeming burden of projecting a
 
national image, where the many and the varied are crucial
 
elements of the one,  gives way to '
a new era; where the nation
 
is represented in all its processes, positions,  and
 
expressions with the strength of a heterogeneous chorus.

Dear  Mr
..  Lomax,
 
August  10,  1992
 
So,  your  greatly anticipated  list--because  this  is
 
a field  I have some attachment to--has arrived,  and what
 
a fine selection  it  is.  You  responded  to  the  assignment
 
exactly  as  we  hope  all  our  consultants  might--with  a
 
breadth  and  depth  and  width  that  ends  up  enclosing  far
 
more than some academic definition of  "folklorists. "  It
 
her
. been a problem  with consultancies--some,  that is:  we
 
get someone who claims to understand what  is wanted,  and
 
then, submits  a list  of  academic colleagues!
 (You  would
 
be  surprised,
 too--or  perhaps  not--at  how  many  of  the
 
"worthies"  in  a  field  live  on  the  East  Coast  when  your
 
consultant  lives  there,
 and  how  many  "worthies"
 in  a
 
field  live on  the  West  Coast  when  your consultant  lives
 
therel)
 
And  yes,  your  list  might  appear  to be  missing some
 
of  the  "giants"  if  people  did  not  realize  that  these
 
individuals
 had
 not
 already
 surfaced
 on
 other
 
consultants'  lists.
 (If  you  ever  run  this  list  by  your
 
brother,  be  sure  he  understands  that. )
 Since  everyone
 
will  ultimately be carried  in  alphabetical  sequence,  it
 
really
 doesn 't
 matter
 who
 ends
 up
 nominating
 such
 
people. )
 
I am putting the invoice for the "modest honorarium"
 
in  this same post.
 The volume itself will  probably take
 
almost two years to come out--it is qu ite an undertaking.
 
And
 if
 it
 succeeds,
 it
 will
 owe
 a
 great
 deal
 to
 
consultants  like  yourself,  who have given  of  themselves
 
beyond  the call of duty.
 But  I like to believe that  you
 
mean what you say--that there was some fun in it all:  the
 
eternal  appeal  of  the  10  Best...  Listl
 Or  as  I like  to
 
say,
 the  appeal  of  -this  chore  lies  somewhere  between
 
playing  Trivial  Pursuit  and  Playing Godl
 
If  my  contributing  writer  has  a  problem  down  the
 
line  zeroing  in  on  source  material  for  any  of  these
 
individuals,
 I  may
 yet
 turn
 to
 you
 for
 guidance.
 
Meanwhile,  our  thanks for  your  fine contribution.

Apt.  410

 VA 22203
 
Dear Mrs.  Hawes:
 
June 11,  1992
 
So,
 we  seem  to  have  skipped  a  whole  stage  of
 
correspondence
 with
 that
 full
 and
 satisfying
 phone
 
conversation,  and  I don't  think  I need  take  our  time
 
now to repeat all the points we went over.
 The enclosed
 
copy of the guidelines,  meanwhile,  is intended to answer
 
any general questions about criteria and procedures.
 
As  to  individuals  you  might  want  to  list  and  who
 
have already surfaced on other lists,  I believe there are
 
relatively few.
 I have already mentioned Francis James
 
Child.
 And then there is that woman whose name we both  "blocked"
 
on:  Alice  Cunningham  Fletcher.
 (Or  perhaps  you  had  another  in
 
mind--there are several early women anthropologists/folklorists who
 
might be included.)
 
There  are  some  individuals  already  nominated  and  whom  you
 
might be tempted to pull in under your tent-"Parson"  Weems,  Johnny
 
Appleseed,  P.  T.  Barnum,  Henry Rowe Schoolcraft,  Paul Radin,  Edward
 
Sapir,  Adolph  Bandelier,  Edward Curtis  (the  photographer).  Also,
 
I should tell you  that virtually all the better known  "primitive"
 
painters  got  listed--which  doesn't  mean  that  you  aren't  free  to
 
nominate any primitive/folk artists you fear might be overlooked.
 
And
 by  and
 large  you
 are
 free  to
 nominate  some
 25-30
 
individuals you feel  belong in such a work.
 We know of two names
 
already--the Lomaxes.  I assume someone like Botkin will  be in.
 A
 
Vance  Randolph?  (Do  I have  those names correct?)
 A Pete  Seeger?
 
Burl Ives,  for that matter.  (I' m not sure how you "pros" feel about
 
old  Burl,  but  I am constantly  amazed  to find  how  many  Americans-
-who otherwise know nothing about American folksongs--think fondly
 
of his renditions that they grew up with.)
 Then there are some of
 
the  pioneer  collectors  of  American  folk  art  and  artifacts:  you
 
might  want to consider  a few of  them.  No need  to get  into crafts
 
people themselves--they have been nominated by another consultant-
-unless you want to make absolutely sure that some oldtimer is not
 
overlooked.
 
Just keep in mind:  this is to be a biographical work for use
 
by  the  general  public.
 As  such,
 the  selection  of  those  to  be
 
included  is based  on  functional  rather  than  judgmental  criteria.
 
Put another way,  the subjects are individuals the public is apt to
 
come  across  in  other  texts  or  contexts  and  of  whom  they  want  a
 
concise biography.  The point  is that  we want relatively  "high
 
CA MBRIDGE U NIVERSITY PRESS
 
f
 
profile"  people,  those whose names are apt to show up outside the
 
specialists'  literature.  That  said,  we  have  no objections  if  you
 
want  to  single  out  a few  individuals  who  may  not  be  "household
 
names"  but who you feel  are the unrecognized of this field or who
 
you feel are working on the leading edge of the field at the moment
 
and who are going to be widely recognized in coming years.
 
Note,  too,  that  in  addition  to  any  names  you  nominate,  we
 
would  appreciate  it  if  you  could  indicate  alongside
 (a)
 the
 
briefest
 of  characterizations  of  the  contribution
 (e. q 
"tale
 
collector,"
 "folksong
 collector,"
 "scholar")
 and
 (b)
 some
 
approximate dates--"early 20th cent."
 or  "still  active"  or  "mid-
20th  cent."
 Then,
 after  you  have  drawn  up  the  your  list  of
 
nominations,  we  ask  you  to  perform  one  other  chore:  indicate  by
 
placing  a  1 beside  about  50%  of  the  total  those  you  regard  as
 
somewhat  more  important;
 finally,
 we  invite  you  to  place  an
 
asterisk  beside  about  two  or  three  (of  those  already  with  the  1)
 
you regard as the true giants of the field.
 
As well  as being  acknowledged in the volume,  all consultants
 
will receive a complimentary copy and a modest honorarium--in this
 
case,  $50.  As  I must  tell  all  our  consultants,  we know  very  well
 
that we cannot truly repay  individuals like yourself for the deep
 
knowledge  we  expect  to  tap,  but  we  hope  that  you  will  find  this
 
both challenging and enjoyable.
 
As for the timeframe,  we have agreed that you will try to get
 
your  list to me by the end of July.
 
And don't  hesitate to  ask  any  questions you  may  have  as you
 
proceed.
 
For
 now,
 our
 appreciation
 to
 you
 for
 taking
 on
 this
 
assignment.
 
cerely,

Dear Ms.  Hawes:
 
(
413) 5
84-4730
 
May 27,  1992
 
You  have been  recommended  to  us  (by  your  brother,
 
as it happens!)  as an authority in your field who
 
might be willing to help us in our project-in-progress -
-specifically,  to  serve  as  a consultant  in  nominating
 
individuals to be included  in our forthcoming Cambridge
  
Dictionary  of  American  Bioqraphy. Here  we explain  only
 
the general  conditions of both the project and your
 
contribution;
 if
 you
 indicate
 a
 willingness
 to
 
participate,  we shall provide the details on criteria for
 
inclusion,  procedures,  etc.
 
The work for which you are being asked to serve on our panel
 
of consultants is to be a completely new one-volume dictionary of
 
biographies  of  notable  Americans.
 (There  will  be  about  9, 300
 
individuals,  both  livinq  and dead.) 
It  is designed  as  a serious
 
reference  work  to  be  used  by  the  general  public.  As  such,  the
 
selection  of  those  to  be  included  is  based  on  functional  rather
 
than
 judgmental
 criteria.
 Put  another  way,
 the  subjects  are
 
individuals  the  public  is  apt  to  come  across  in  other  texts  or
 
contexts and of whom they want a concise biography.
 
In
 asking
 you
 to
 serve
 as
 consultant,
 we
 ask
 of
 you
 
essentially one chore: to nominate some 20-25 Americans who deserve
 
inclusion  in  such  a work  because of  their  work  and/or reputation
 
in  the  field  of  American  folklore.
 I realize  that  this  is  not
 
necessarily  an  absolutely  defined  field,  and  we  would  want  our
 
consultant to take as broad a perspective as seems necessary:  field
 
workers,  scholars/collectors,  ethnomusicologists--yes,  and even an
 
actual  "folk"  tale-teller or two,  if  (s)he demanded inclusion,  in
 
your judgment.  I can also imagine someone like the man who founded
 
Folkways  Records.
 And  so  on.
 (It  goes  without  saying  that  two
 
slots are reserved for the Lomaxes,  pe
"re and file.)
 
Inevitably,  too,  you might nominate some individuals who will
 
overlap with those who are surfacing in other related fields  (say,
 
cultural  anthropologists,  popular  musicians,  etc.)  but  we  shall
 
take  care of  that  on  this  end.  (
 I could  send  on  a list  of  a few
 
such  individuals  I think  you  might  be  tempted  to  nominate--e. q.
 
Francis James Child--thus freeing  up those spaces for others.)  In
 
any case,  all entries will be carried alphabetically,  not under any
 
occupational  groupings.
 
The point is that this to be a reference work for the general
 
public,  so we  want  relatively  "high  profile"  people,  those  whose

t

e
 
names  are  apt  to  show  up  in  a  variety  of  contexts  outside  the
 
specialists'  literature.  That  said,  we have  no objections  if  you
 
want  to  single  out  a few  individuals  who  may  not  be  "household
 
names"  but who you feel are the unrecognized of this field or who
 
you feel are working on the leading edge of the field at the moment
 
and who are going to be widely recognized in coming years.
 
In addition to any names you nominate,  we would appreciate it
 
if you could indicate alongside  (a)  the briefest of characteriza-
tions
 of
 the
 contribution
 (
 e. q 
"tale
 collector, "
 "folksong
 
collector, "
 "scholar") and (b) some approximate dates--"early 20th
 
cent."
 or "still active" or "mid-20th cent. "
 Then,  after you have
 
drawn  up the your  list  of  nominations,  we  ask  you  to  perform one
 
other chore:  indicate by placing a 1 beside about 50% of the total
 
those you regard as somewhat more important; finally,  we invite you
 
to place  an  asterisk  beside  about  two or  three  (of  those already
 
with the 1)  you regard as the true giants of the field.
 
As well  as being acknowledged in the volume,  all consultants
 
will receive a complimentary copy and a modest honorarium.  We are
 
well aware that we cannot truly repay individuals like yourself for
 
the deep knowledge we expect to tap,  but we hope that you will find
 
this both challenging and enjoyable.
 
As for  the timeframe,  assuming  you were willing to take this
 
on and could reply soon,  I would have the guidelines in your hands
 
by  early  June  and  we  would  then  want  to  have  your  list  by  mid-
July.
 
Please don't hesitate to ask any questions you may have before
 
coming  to  your decision.  I can  be reached  at  the phone number on
 
the letterhead and if I' m not in,  leave a message on the answering
 
machine and  I'll return the call.
 
Finally,  if for any reason you cannot take on this assignment,
 
we would  be  most  grateful  if  you could  recommend  someone equally
 
qualified.
 
My apologies for going on at such length,  but I have found it
 
is  best
 to  explain
 as  much  as  relevant  to  help  prospective
 
consultants make up their minds.

It seems a lot of money.
 
Again, Hank, I hada wonderful time and you were a great host.  Please let me
 
know ifI can ever return the hospitality -- I too have an extra bedroom currently
 
occupied by stacks and stacks of books but eventually to be made habitable.
 
And please give my love to Becca, Judy, Jackie, Erin, Anne, Joey, Al and all
 
other kind friends.  I always feel as though Alabama i
s a second home, and
 
everytime I visit I wonder just why.  It's not really l
ike where I grew up --
maybe i
t justseems l
ike an echo of a particular time when I feltat home.
 
Affectionately always,
 
Bess
 
P
.S.  Please excuse typing.  I feel these days I am always coping with one
 
kind of a new machine or another, and this one doesn't seem to l
ike to skip
 
spaces between words.  I
'll get i
t under control yet....
