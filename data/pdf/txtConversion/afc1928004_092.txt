AS GOOD AS GOLD. 
By J. II. Almsuum. 
Though fond of j 
diity sometimes,' 
I 
like a 
quiet life. 
And love a 
cosy ev fling pass'd, 
At borne with my old ‘N 
ife ; 
She brought me neither house nor land. 
Her wealth could soon be told, 
But she's a fortune in herself, 
And that's as good as gold. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she's as good as gold, she is, 
She's just as good as gold, 
And I 
can see she's fond of me, 
For she's as good as gold. 
She does not wear the finest robes, 
Nor dress in silk a tire, 
But then if she looks fair to me, 
What more can I 
desire, 
Our house is not the grandest, but, 
As it keeps out the cold, 
It pleases me and pleases her, 
And she's as good as gold. 
Yes, she's, 
When matters go a 
little wrong, 
And fortune seems to flown, 
If one's a 
wife as good as gold, 
One can't be long cast down; 
For when I 
reach my home at night, 
She dues not fret or scold, 
But always greets me with a 
smile, 
And that's as good as gold. 
For she's, &e. 
Contented folks are happier. 
Than those who've greatest wealth, 
For g,oll does not buy happiness, 
Nor can it purchase health ; 
My wife and I 
will be content, 
When we have grown old, 
To be as happy then as now, 
And that's as good as gold.

AS GOOD AS GOLD. 
LADIES' VERSION. 
My love is but a 
shepherd lad. 
A shepherdess am 
From morn till eve we watch our flocks, 
Beneath the bright Itie sky; 
There's nothing troubles me, altho' 
My fortune soon is told, 
And Colin's poor in worhily wealth, 
But he's as good as gold. 
CHORUS. 
He's just as good as wild he is, 
Hr's just as good as gold, 
And I 
cut see he's fond of me, 
For he's as good as gold. 
His coat is somewhat worse for wear, 
And is not trinon'd with lace, 
His hat would scarcely do for some 
More fashionable place; 
But what care 1, altho' he wears 
A ragged suit so old, 
His heart is in the proper place, 
And just as good as gold. 
He's just, dm. 
We're vino- to build a 
little house, 
And make a 
garden gav, 
Directly Colin s 
ship conies home, 
He says it's on the way ; 
Altho' a 
little place, ' twill do, 
To keep out rain and cold, 
To roe ' twill be a 
palace grand, 
For he's us good as gold. 
He's just, & c. 
lie's going to take me to the church, 
One happy day in spring. 
When hedges w;11 be white with May 
And yillige bells will ri!.g ; 
Their sound x‘ill linger in our ears, 
When we have both grown old, 
And oh ! how happy I 
shall be, 
For he's as good as gold. 
He's just, (U.

She whispered softly : " Ketp my child—''

In her " litt'e bed" we laid her, 
When the roses lost their bloom, 
And a

Close beside her mother's lonely tomb; 
Little birdie sang his sad notes, 
As her spirit passed away, 
Ere she sought the home of angels, 
In the land of perfect day.

Little birdie sing your sweetest, 
For, darling is an angel now, 
She is free from pain and sorrow, 
With love's star upon her heavenly brow.. 
Far too lovely was our darling, 
For this cold and bitter life, 
And although we weep to miss her, 
She is free from mortal worldly strife; 
And we dream her angel mother, 
Strokes again her darling's head. 
And, amid angelic music, 
Lays her in her little bed.

A friendof mine ask'd me one day if I'd go*, 
To his snug little box out of town ; 
The invite I 
acce?ted and started.fr'xt day 
By the nine forty-five express down. 
I 
soon reach'd his place, andhe said to me, 
My deax Boy while with us you stay; 
Yon can boat, shoot, or fish, do just what you wisle„ 
en condition that at Croquet you play; 
CHORUS-
-jr 
At Croquet, Croquet, a 
proper game to play', 
At Croquet, Croquet, 1 
could play all day; 
There's nothing can surpass, the sport upon the grails.. 
In that Awful Jolly game call'd Croquet. 
A. nice little party he had at his honso, 
And each sunny daras a 
treat; 
At Crovet we'd play with such dear little girle 
Who in short dresses- shew'd pretty feet. 
Soon one t 
selected as a 
partner for play, 
Such a,duck as a 
partner for life ; 
It roqueted ' he balls- and Croqueted the hoops; 
And I 
tried to. Croquet her for my wife. 
At Croquet, Croquet, &us-
Tonng 
Bottnee of " the Mines didn't like it-at all, 
For with my partner- he played as a 
rule ; 
So like Knights of old we retired to a 
wood , 
And with our Mallets then we fought a 
duel. 
We fenced and we. fought till- he cried" hold-, enongli--
The lady I'll resign unto yon ; 
Tho' many yearfsin the Mires I 
have been, 
I'm now beaten black as well as blue." 
Ctoquet, Croquet, & 
Then back to my partnzr a 
-victor T 
went, 
And at rropret and love play'd my part; 
'When w‘ ' d 
beat all t-he rest, I 
tholight lt the best, 
To at once make a 
stroke for her heart. 
We'd moue tin- 
the hoops. and struck hnth the post. 
When I 
asked her to be mine for life: 
So well VA played my part. I'd ( 7toetno'd her heart, 
..fuld, a. Cold hcopeeou made her my wife.

LADIES' VERSION. 
There is one charming game, we girls 'love to play, 
And for 111J3 there are-few can surpass; 
The game of Croquet, when fine is the day, 
Then what f 
UU we can have on the grass. 
We play 9e Coquette, as well as Croquet, 
And we don t 
care a 
fig what they say; 
We change all our partners as often as the ,gamit, 
And have uew lovers every day, 
CrfORUS. 
At Croquet, Croquet, a 
charming game to plays 
At Croquet, Croquet, I 
could play an day; 
rot nothing can surpass, the fun upon the grass, 
In that very jolly game caned Croquet 
A friend of ours asked TIS one day if we'd go, 
To his house in the country to stay; 
And each sunny morn, a 
party on the lawn, 
That charming game of Croquet would play. 
With. Captain De Bounce, and Major Fitz Blue, 
A Curate and a 
middy or two; 
I'm not a 
Coquette, or what you'd call a 
flirt, 
But must say I 
had partners a 
few, 
At Croquet, Sot% 
With the Major, the Parson, and Middy I 
played, 
Which the'Captain didn't like I 
must grant; 
It really was too bad, and nearly drove him mad, 
As a 
partner to give hint my aunt. 
And the uld lady thought, as all ladies will, 
That she'd somehow won the Captain's heart; 
Her are is 'Fixty three, I 
knew it was for time, 
The dear fellow tried to play his part. 
At Croquet, tIce. 
'When in the nett game as his partner I 
stood, 
lie said remain my partner for life ; 
My heart he'd Croqueted, never mind what I 
said, 
But I 
fancy I 
shall soon be his wife. 
So all through that game I 
shall soon change my name, 
And to you single ladies I 
say; 
That if you wish to mate, before it is too late, 
Join a 
party in a 
game of Croquet,

WHERE'S PETER. 
once was so happy but now Pm sad, 
0 so sad—drea ifully sad, 
A young man named Peter's behaved so bad,

Buy the ring—buy the ring. 
But now I've found out he meant no such thing,

Does anyone know where my Poter's gone ? 
Peter's gone, Peter's gone ? 
Does anyone know where my Peter's gone 
Where 0 I 
where is my Peter, 
bly Peter was handsome—in style so smart, 
Dashing and smart—he soon won my heart, 
He often declared that we never should part, 
And of course— I'd believe all he'd say ; 
He'd call me his darling, his dear and his dove, 
And heaved such a 
sigh when he squeezed my glove, 
We'd reside in a 
villa and live upon love, 
So at last—I—of course—named he day. 
But does anyone, &c. 
I 
told my acquaintance and felt a 
slight pride. 
A small bit of pride— I 
was to be a 
bride, 
Some wished me much happiness, some of them cried. 
Declared that they envied my lot ; 
We were to be married at Hanover Square, 
Hanover Square, with bridesmaids fair, 
We arrived at the church, but he was'nt there, 
I 
waited but Peter came not. 
So does anyone, &a 
I 
thought at the moment I 
should go mad, 
Actually mad—most awfully mad, 
To serve me like that, 0 it was too bad, 
I 
thought it I 
ne'er should survive ; 
How some of the bridesmaids too tittered with spite, 
'Twas unfeeling quite, I'd no sleep that night, 
But out of revenge for so cruel a 
slioht, 
Find a more constant beau 
contrive, 
So I 
don't care a 
fig for where Peter's gone, 
Peter's gone, Peter's gone? 
I 
don't mean to fret because Peter's gone, 
lie's a 
false, fickle, frail, faithless Peter,

THE MOONLIGHT WALK. 
By J. H. 3!tin.suan. 
Last autumn I 
went out of town, 
Just for a 
change of air; 
It's very strange but so it was, 
A charmer I 
met there. 
how pleasantly the ev'Ding passq, 
While listning to her talk; 
.For I 
first made her acquaintance, 
When I 
took a 
moonlight walk. 
There's nothing half so jolly tut a 
moonlight walk, 
A moonlight walk, a 
moonlight walk; 
There's nothing half so jolly as a 
moonlight walk. 
A moonlight walk for me. 
Quite by myself I 
took a 
stroll, 
To view the lovely -scenes; 
To read the stars, as some folks say, 
Tho' I 
scarce know what that means; 
I'd not gone far before I 
heard, 
A footstep on the grass; 
'On turning lound, just by my -side, 
I 
saw this damsel pass. 
There's nothing, &c. 
The next night too, I 
saw her there, 
'Twas strange, now, was it not ? 
And the' I 
scarce can tell you how, 
Acquainted we soon got. 
She said 
her l'a was Captain of 
The well known Tomahawk.;" 
And like me. to study nature's scenes, 
She took that moonlight walk. 
There's nothing, &c. 
Night after night it seem'd as if 
By fate we both were led ; 
So long before I 
came to town, 
I 
asked her if she d

She blushing, said, " she felt, that she 
My pleasure could hot baulk ;" 
So promised that she'd have me, while 
We took our moonlight walk. 
There's nothing, dt.c. 
Now shortly I 
shall call her mine, 
And we will go away; 
To some secluded spot to pass 
The honeymoon so gay. 
And there together all the day, 
Of by-gone times we'll talk; 
And not forget to speak about 
Our pleasant moonlight walk.

GOOD OLD FRIENDS, AND GOOD OLD WINE 
Air—" Put the Break on." 
There's nothing like good wine depend, 
To make man's heart rejoice. 
And nothing like a 
good old friend, 
To cheer him with his vo cc 
Tho' life iS brief—and cares and. grief, 
Most of us have to bear. 
With friends to laugh—and wine to quaff, 
We need not quite despair. 
CHORUS. 
With good old friends, and good old wine, 
To cheer this life of mine ; 
With good old friends, and good old wine, 
I 
never will repine. 
A 
bottle of old crusted port, 
Give me when things look blue, 
A good old friend, a 
roivr-ly sort, 
To share it with me, too; 
With both, beside my own hearthstone, 
I 
envy ne'er a 
man— 
Celestial Emperor, on his throne, 
Nor Turk on his divan 
With good old friends, 
When women jilt, when men betray, 
When fortune on us frowns, 
When wealth take.: wing and flies away, 
In this life's ups and downs. 
Or when we mourn— for loved ones gone 
And feel inclined to pine, 
It's sweet to meet—and kindly greet, 
Old friends, with good old. wine. 
With good old friends. dic. 
I 
envy not the millionaire, 
Nor wish for rank and show, 
I 
only want a 
moderate share, 
Of good things, here below ; 
This maxim's mine— till I 
recline 
In my last tenement, 
With good old friends, and good old wine, 
I'll ever be content. 
With good old friends, &T.

Tho' day is declining, the first. star is shining,, 
The zephyr rocks the flowers to repose ; 
Come forth now and meet me, with beaming smile greet me, 
And shew that face where matchless beauty glows. 
CHORUS. 
Then come, come, come, come, dear, come, 
Come forth and wander wiih me, 
By all bright above me, I 
vow that I 
love thee, 
Dear Ellen, dear Ellen of the Lea. 
If grief should o'ertake thee, thy friends all forsake thee, 
in thy distress I'll closer cling to thee ; 
Till life's last breath yielding, thy form I'll be shielding, 
Dear Ellen, dear Ellen of the Lea. 
Then come, ctc. 
And when age appearing, life's close we are nearing, 
And all thy golden locks are turning grey ; 
The love I 
now cherish, in age will not perish, 
It will be as pure as on my nuptial day.

Oh, take thy own sweet harp again, 
And strike the golden string, 
And that old song of by-gone days, 
Once more unto me sing; 
Forget the troubles that have cast, 
A gloom upon thy brow, 
And as thou wert in seasons past, 
Oh, let me s, e 
thee now. 
I 
know thy tender heart is bowed, 
Beneath the weight of woe, 
But still regard it its a 
cloud, 
That only comes to go. 
Oh, take thy own sweet harp again, 
And strike the golden string, 
And that old song of by-gone days, 
Once more unto me sing.

THE CAT'S-MEAT MAN. 
Oh! love it is a 
ticklish thing, 
it makes true lovers blue ; 
I 
mean such chaps as me, whose heart 
is big enough for two. 
For twelve long months I 
spent my time 
And money, which wits very much ; 
On a 
nursemaid in a 
family, 
Where they all spoke double Dutch. 
CHORUS, 
But Sarah's gone and left me, 
her love for toe was a 
sham; 
I 
never thought she was so false, 
And elope with a 
cat's- meat man. 
By trade lam a 
sandwich man, 
That is—I 
carry boards ; 
And it poor man has a 
heart to love, 
As well as Dukes and Lords. 
And so hail I. 
I 
told her SO, 
She promised me she'd wed ; 
And so she did, but ' t 
wasn't me— 
'Twas the cat's-meat man instead. 
But Sarah's gone, dm 
I 
ne'er had cause to doubt her, 
Until I 
used to see; 
A 
cat's- meat man call twice a 
day, 
Who tried to rival me. 
With his pen'orth of meat upon a 
skewer, 
Ball- price to her he'd sell ; 
And that was how he won her heart, 
And left me hero to tell— 
That Sarah's gone, &a 
She thought by marrying the cat's-meat man, 
Ti lead a 
happy life ; 
But he takes his ease, she goes his rounds, 
ile's made her a

I 
never knew that she could sing,

With a

I'LL HAVE YOUR EYE P 
1Vritten by J. I.Loyn. 
Street sayings now are all the go, 
d 
never :
Nevin to cease ; 
In fact, quite far from that, indeed 
scent daily to increase. 
Precocious boys. and fast yiqing girls, 
Have lately learn d another cry ; 
And as they pass you in the street, 
Salute you N‘ith 
I'll have your eye 1" 
I'll have your eye. I'll have your eye 
Is getting now the constant cry ; 
And every girl who passes by, 
Of course shouts out 
I'll have your eye!" 
Not only little boys and girls, 
Thus laugh at your expense; 
But people more advanced in years, 
Who should have better sense. 
I 
met a 
lady OA her day, 
It's true I 
quizzed her rather sly; 
But guess my feelings when she turned, 
And winking said, " I'll have your eye?" 
I'll have your eye, dm. 
These folks who thus try to annoy, 
Seem quite a 
greedy lot; 
Not only do they want your eye, 
But everything you've got. 
I 
went into a 
Pastrycooles, kept 
By a 
friend of mine nant'd South ; 
And \Odle partaliing of a tart. 
Heard some one shout - I'll have your month 1" 
I'll have your eye, &c. 
Electioneering business seems 
The order of the day; 
And candidates can't notice what 
These little urchins say. 
Because they've gut a 
ciy themselves, 
Which now seems very much afloat ; 
When canvassing. on you they call, 
And tell you that " they'll have your vote." 
I'll have your eye, & c. 
But still I 
think when all is said, 
No halm is really done ; 
And all these jokes are simply 
To raise a 
little fun. 
Ahd now in v 
song is at an end, 
I 
ask one thing before I 
pause 
And shall he happy if you will 
But let me say " I've your applause!" 
I'll have your eye, &o. 
WHILE THE GAS IS BURNING: 
You'll hear some people moralise, 
And say it is a 
sin, 
To drink and smoke, and crack a 
joke 
Or stay out and spend one's tin; 
But that's all silly twaddle, 
I 
enjoy myself at night, 
And never think of going home, 
While the gas lamps are a-light 
Night is the time to have a 
spree my boys, 
Our fun requires no learning, 
We never think of going borne, 
Not while the gas is burning. 
The time o' day when I 
get up— 
. Is about two P. M., 
I 
ring for boots, and morning suit, 
And soon slip into them, 
I 
sip my coffee, read the Post, 
Try Billiards, Pyramids, or Pool 
Untill the time approaches, 
To meet the gas light school. 
Night is the time, fbe. 
I 
suppose if I 
get married, 
These things mu-t 
be reversed, 
But I 
fancy it will take some time, 
For I'm not to be coerced, 
I've hini my own way for so long, 
That % would be hard to reform, 
But I'd do that rather than stir up, 
A 
matrimonial storm. 
Night is the time, (fre. 
But while a 
bachelor I 
remain, 
I'll just do as I 
please, 
I'll go out, also come home, 
Just to suit my taste or ease 
And to meet it set of jolly boys, 
Like these I 
see to-
night, 
Is worth a 
night's spree in the square, 
When the gas is burning bright. 
Night is the time, tte,

THE FASHIONABLE BOYS 
Written and Sung by J. 
LLOYD. 
gou've heard about those fellows gay 
They call the " Roaring Boys," 
Who rather like the sobriquet, 
Their noisy crew enjoys ; 
We've started now another school, 
of tashioaahle grade, 
And by our dashing style, put 
All others in the shade. 
CHORUS. 
For we are the Fashionable Boys, 
Our style is the top of the tree, 
Unrivall d 
for frolic, fun, and noise, 
And up to every fashionable spree. 
'Wee never join these fellow s, 
Of the Champagne Charley sort, 
Whose great delight seems getting tight, 
They think it best of sport ; 
We always act as gentlemen, 
Although we may be gay, 
And carry on our pastimes, 
In a 
Fashionah:e way. 
For we are, & c. 
In Rotten Row, or in the Park,

For our superiority,

GOOD FOR NOTHING NAN'. 
Written by JOHN W . 
LLOYD. 
Folks call me good for nothing, 
But I 
don't see why they slionhl. 
I 
never does no harm, although, 
I 
never does much good: 
Because I 
like to have a 
lark, 
They scold me all they can, 
But still there's nothing wrong I 
know, 
In " Good for nothing Nan." 
CHORUS. 
I'm good for nothing Nancy, or so the people s:iy, 
For work is not my fancy, I'd rather be at play ; 
They try to keep me quiett, but I'm sure they never can, 
I'd rather romp than work, because I'm good for nothing Nan.

gets up in the morning, 
And I 
gees and lights the fire, 
Then lias a

Along with old Sophia ; 
I 
then go out to meet the boys, 
And gives ' era plenty 0' cheek, 
Then has a 
game at Whippi g 
Top, 
Hop scotch or hide and Seek. 
I'm good for nothing &c. 
The other day the landlord's son, 
Came here to get the rent, 
As I 
was chucking up some mud, 
Right on his bat it went ; 
But when he said he'd look me up, 
I 
gave him such a 
crack, 
And in the row his Sunday coat, 
Got torn right off his hack. 
I'm good f. .r nothing, & c. 
They want to make me go to school, 
To learn to read and write. 
And though it may be good for sonic, 
It does'ut suit me quite; 
The schoolmaster the other day. 
He said that me 1 
e'd whop, 
He didn't have a 
chance, because, 
Next day I 
played the hop. 
For I'm good for noth.ng,

PADDY THE TURK. 
I 
was born one fine morn, on the banks of the Liffey, 
I've often been told and am ready to swear, 
But had I 
ta.e choice I'd not entered a 
jiffey, 
This curious world full of trouble and care ; 
k No doctor nor nurse was there n ear my poor mother, 
Mv father was down on the broad of his back, 
laly brother who'd got in some bother or other, 
Had fifty policemen or more on his track. 
And durin' my nursin' earessin' and cursitf 
Like kicks were in plenty tho' 
nee were few, 
But little receivin' for a 
gossoon ' tis grievin' 
Who'd scorn to be thievin'—wh t 
was I 
to do; 
At length as I 
grew up, my young head I 
drew up, 
And vow'd from dear Dublin I 
would roam afar, 
Aly shillalagh I 
twisted, and soon I 
enlisted, 
To fight as a 
Turk in the Crimean war. 
As a 
Turk then behold me, I 
did as they told me, 
When ever to do so I 
felt in the mind, 
But the splinter I'd pick up, a 
row soon I'd pick up, 
. 
If they wished me to do what I 
was not inclined; 
Their language I 
learn'd it, my old hat I 
burn'd it, 
An I 
put on a 
fez as a 
mussulman should, 
And as for my muscle in many a 
tussle, 
I 
proved that for fiahting my muscle was good 
Till then I'd no notion of any devotion, 
I 
was not a 
Christian until I 
turn'd Turk, 
But I 
gain'd my promotion across the salt ocean 
And looted on devotion as part of my work; 
Of course it must suit ye as part of the duty, 
To turn to the cast wheA you see the sun rise, 
I 
did so one mornin' without any \vandal', 
I 
felt that my fez was knocked over my eyes 
[1] 
PADDY THE TURK [CoNcLuDED.] 
When finished I 
took up my fez then did look up, 
To see who had given these unprovok'd blows, 
When a 
sailor bawl*d out and a 
Scotchman did shou 
You villain you're kneelin' and stoppin' our hose; 
On the hose I 
was hneelin' both seem' and feelin', 
Convinc'd me when Scotty said " get up, you scamp, 
For an i.our and a 
quarter, we've waited for water, 
But the devil a 
drop could be had in the camp. 
Tho' my blcod was nigh b 
I 
could not he .p 
smilin 
For fun as I 
thought of the mischief I'd done, 
And should have forgiven what I'd been receivin' 
Hal the thought not occured there were two men to one; 
To think and hit out were as one to poor Paddy; 
I 
floored both at once right and left in the face, 
Each tried to conic up again no sooner had be 
Than another he got in the very same place. 
Tho' neither retreated, the dose when repeated, 
Made each of these bold British heroes reflect, 
Says Jack 
queer work to be lick'd by a 
Turk, 
Says Scotty I've change which I 
didna expect. 
Tho' he looks like a 
Turk, still he hits like Tom Sayers, 
His fist is as gentle and tender as horn, 
But says I 
when you next strike a 
Turk at his prayers, 
Be sure that he is not an Irishman born. 
With another short verse will the song be concluded, 
No matter wherever one Paddy may roam, 
Ile.11 stick to the habits, the fightin' included, 
Indulged in by all other Paddies at home; 
Small blame for that same to each bold son of Erin, 
'Tis a 
dare devil feelin' that nothin can kill, 
No matter what country or clime he appears in, 
An Irishman must be an Irishman still.

THE OLD MISER. 
By GEORGE LEYBOURNE. 
In this world there's men of all sorts, 
Wise, foolish, great, and small; 
But the subject of my little song 
Is most foolish of them all. 
It is about a 
miser, 
In misery he roams ; 
He loves to hear the jingling 
Of that precious stuff called gold. 
He loves to hear it jingle, 
lie loves to hear it roll; 
He loves it more than anything, 
That precious stuff called gold. 
He walks about ill misery, 
His mind is never at rest; 
When in his bed he cannot sleep, 
For the weight that's on his chest ; 
He's dressed in rags and tatters, 
He's hungry and he's cold ; 
He will not touch a 
penny, 
From that precious heap of gold. 
He loves to hear, &e.. 
In his house there is no comfort, 
No furniture therein; 
No children there to chatter, 
No wife to comfort him. 
He's not a 
soul to speak to, 
His roribles to unfold ; 
Re sits alone in misery, 
Counting of his gold. 
He loves to hear, &e. 
At length his health it leaves him, 
For nature will decay; 
He will not have a 
doctor, 
For him he will not pay ; 
He's on a 
bed of sickness, 
Till death it does him hold; 
And the last words be has to say, 
Oh, lot um clutch my gold! 
He loves to hear, &c. 
What is the use of money! 
It is no use at all; 
But to spend and to be happy, 
Let your share be great or small. 
But money is the root of all evil, 
At least so I 
have been uld; 
But it's very nice to have a 
few 
Of those precious coins that's made of gold. 
Ile loves to hear. &c.

OUR SERVANT'S SECRET BALL. 
Last week our servant's ball took place, 
So ,rrand a 
rout I 
ne'er did trace ; 
Being maste s 
flunky 1 
bad my say, 
And placed things in a 
proper way. 
The party came, some short, seine long, 
We lenstered twenty-seven strong ; 
We all looked largo though we were small, 
At our servant's secret blab 
CHouus.. 
The bones arid banjo so did play, 
In turn we all did dance away ; 
I 
never shall forget the noise soul squall, 
We had at our servant's secret ball. 
John dressed himself in Betty's frock, 
And so amused the blessed stock; 
Our Sally wore the butler's coat, 
And put on a 
false Billy- goat. 
Miss Jane put On master's smalls, 
The nurse wore Harry's overalls; 
The 13,bbies to their sweethearts did stall, 
Yes—to keep order at our servant's Ball. 
The bones, Ac. 
Some came as niggers brown and black, 
And the girls lips c 
hey did smack ; 
All their designs appeared quite dark, 
For with every hiss they left a 
mark. 
Our cook's chap the whole hog did go, 
He sang and danced Bob Ridley 0; 
He rtpct chairs and tables all, 
At our servant's seeret Ball. 
The bones, eze 
The butler kept ns in a 
roar, 
For he sung and looked just like the Cure; 
And master Thomas he got tight, 
And nearly set the erib 
The chaps hugged the girls upon the sly, 
They got kissed to death, or very nigh; 
When a 
double-knoc 
surprised us ail, 
At our servant's secret Bait 
The bones, der.,. 
It's master's knock, exclaimed young Fan, 
In all directions off we ran ; 
Some in the dust hole -there did roll, 
Others tanOit-d anionglit tire •coal.

So we sent tlwin 'tip the flue; 
Awl down came master ainidst it all, 
To hutch up our secret hail.

row, 0 such a

Such mangled forms there met my ryes,

And turne.1 the whole lot in the street;

ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD. 
in this world of care and trouVe, 
Where men toil with hand and brain; 
Seeking fame— that airy bubhle— 
And not always seek in vain. 
Though the path be strew'd 
ii In flowers, 
And the laurels bind his brow, 
All his friends admire his power; 
Ile c: ,n 
do wis bout them now, 
Still he s 
wasted, worn and weary, 
And he finds lie's growing old; 
Remember thou the sage's adage— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See In e 
warrior, brave in action, 
Ever ready for the fray 
Sternly, nobly, scorns all faction, 
And to freed ml fights his way. 
How he bears with cold and hunger, 
Ilouseless, homeless, 'neath the sky, 
He must march a 
little longer, 
T111 he hears the battle cry. 
Then his soul is 
with glory, 
Tho' his friends lie stark and cold, 
Thus ends many a 
hero's story— 
" 
All that glitters is not gold." 
See that great and mighty noble, 
Rolling in his coach of state, 
Surely he has ne'er known trouble, 
his seems such a 
happy fate; 
Ile has heaps of land and money, 
Lovely x‘ife and children fir, 
What a 
grand ancestral dwelling, 
Surely he has not a 
care ? 
Ask his friends and they will mutter, 
By his bankers he's been sold, 
And this proves the truth I 
utter, 
4' 
All that glitters is not gold."

THE ENGLISH GIRL OF THE PERIOD. 
You volgar bodies think, perhaps, 
That I 
have naught to do; 
Because I 
never put myscif 
In what you call a " stew." 
My day is full, " choke- full," I 
say, 
From early morn till night ; 
Of duties. I 
will write them down 
In sober black and white. 
First, every morning I 
must sleep, 
(That's plainly my first duty) 
As long as possible, how else 
Should I 
preserve my beauty ? 
Then when I 
wake, I 
lie quite still 
That I 
may meditate ; 
On conquests that I 
have in hand, 
Till—well you'd think it late. 
You couldn't do it, no, not you! 
You haven't learnt the way; 
Of being superficially, 
Politely, grave or gay. 
Without distill bing in the least, 
Your woman's heart the while; 
Ah. it is quite a 
social art, 
The easy sigh or smile. 
And then of course I 
have to read, 
To get up a 
sensation; 
Something, at least. that may begin, 
The business of flirtation. 
A run-away, or convent " case," 
A novel, or a 
play; 
Against the evening; some there are 
(Bores, rather) who will say— 
[11 
••• 
ENGLISH GIRL OF THE PERIOD.-cONCLUIIED. 
Next duty is, of course, to plan, 
What costume I 
shall wear; 
'Whether with chignon or long curls, 
My maid shall dress my hair. 
Whether I'll ride, or drive, or walk, 
I've taken to walking lately ; 
Quite as a 
duty, for my walk 
Is said to be so stately. 
And duty to Society, 
(You see I 
know it well;) 
Makes me do all I 
can to please, 
As an acknowledged belle. 
Then, when I'm dressed, I 
ride, or drive, 
Or walk, and ta';e my part 
In saying nothings prettily, 
With most consummate art. 
After the usual " Are you fond 
Of music ?" " Do you care 
For flowers ?" " Have you read this or that r 
And so I 
must prepare. 
For small talk, of all kinds: true art 
Will make one's knowledge go 
• 
Quite far enough; enough to make 
A fashionable show. 
Fashion's my sovereign absolute— 
One can't serve two, 3
-on know ; 
I 
don't go in for being good, 
(Ilurn-drum, that is,) and slow. 
You'll say, perhaps, that all my work 
Is labor spent in vain ; 
But I 
work for the word's applause, 
And what I 
seek, I 
gain.

I 
think it's right to say, 
I'm always first in fashion's view 
In fact, I 
lead the way; 
Whether it's walking up Broadv,ay, 
Or riding in the Park, 
The Roman Fall's a

For me a 
jolly lark.

Now Venus gives the Grecian Bend, 
Apollo gives the bow, 
The joint idea 'when-seen West-End.

A Roland good for an Oliver, 
So given in our walk, 
We swells find it more jolly far 
To do and not to talk. 
Cuoars.-The Roman Fall, as. 
No more the Piccadilly crawl 
Displays the tailor's art; 
We substitute the Roman Fall, 
And charm our darling's heart; 
As three abreast we do the Row, 
The thing is quite unique, 
The patent of a 
perfect beau, 
The trademark of your clique.

AS I 
STROLL'D Al.:01STG THE THAMES. [CONCLUDED 
For she really was a 
sort of girl, 
You don't meet every day, 
She seemed to cast a 
spell on me, 
I 
could not throw away. 
As I 
stroll'd, d:c. 
She told me as we walked along, 
That her name was Mary Bell, 
And said besides, " she knew my Ma, 
And hoped she was quite well." 
But when she said " Your name was Brown, 
And you live near Pimlico," 
I 
thought I'd picked up with a 
witch, 
Or else bow could she know. 
As I 
stroll'd, 
I 
taxed my memory as to where, 
I'd seen her face before, 
Bat was aroused, as old big Ben 
Chimed out the hour of f . ur; 
Said she, ' Oh, hawks I 
I 
must be off., 
For I'm ten minutes late, 
Take this address, and call on me„ 
To-morrow night at eighth" 
As I 
stroll'd, 
Now, to cut my little story short, 
Also my hopes and joys, 
I 
called and found she was a 
wife, 
With two bonny girls and boys! 
And her hush grid was a 
lighterman, 
Upon the river Thames; 
For once done brown, was Brown—by one, 
Of nature's -purest gems.

CHELSEA PIER. 
Attend to me, good people all, and I'll my grief disclose, 
And your compassiou 't,‘ 
ill excite as I 
recount my woes; 
To love, just like some hundreds more, a 
martyr I 
have been, 
But mine's an aggravated case, as plainly will be seen. 
Since I've been serv'd so cruelly, from me all pleasure's fled, 
And- now I 
feel as useless as a 
pin without a 
head ; 
I've been, alas! bamboozled by a 
girl 1 
did revere, 
One who purloined my heart from me, one day on Chelsea. 
Pier. 
=ORME!. 
I've paid for my experience, 
Altho' it cost me dear, 
I 
wish I'd never seen that girl, 
Nor yet seen Chelsea Pier. 
'Twas by the merest accident acquainted we became, 
And iryou were to ask me now, I 
couldn't tell her name; 
We both were standing on the pier, one evening in July, 
And waiting for the steamboat, which we saw approaching 
nigh. 
Now if ' twas over eagerness, or what I 
couldn't tell, 
She lost her equilibrium, and in the water fell; 
I 
gave a 
hasty glance around, saw no assistance near, 
So down I 
dived, just like a 
duck, from off the Chelsea Pier. 
I've paid for my experience, & c. 
I 
dived down to the bottom, at her hair I 
made a 
grab, 
And when I 
did she clung to me as tight as any crab; 
I 
bore my precious burden, till I 
safely reached the shore, 
But she lay there's+) motionless, I 
thought she was-no more. 
To all things I 
resorted, too, to bring the damsel round, 
Put burnt brown-paper to her nose, but 'twas no zse I 
found; 
So, as a 
last resource, I 
was compelled to bite her ear, 
Which brought her too, when she exclaimed, " 0 crikey, 
Chelsea Pier I" 
I've paid for my experience, drc. 
[11 
CHELSEA PIER: [CoNcLuDED.] 
took her to my landlady, good natured Missus Groom, 
Who wrapped her up in blankets, lit a 
fire in her best room ; 
Bought half-a-gill of vinegar, and with it bathed her head, 
Then said " good-night, my little one," then tucked her up in 
bed. 
My dreams that night were pleasant ones, in each I 
saw her 
face, 
'Twas love at first sight, still I 
felt, that naught could it effItce; 
And, as I 
lay, an airy form approached inc very near, 
I 
couldn't well mistake it—twas the girl of Chelsea Pier. 
I've paid for my experience, &c. 
When Mrs. Groom went in the room, next morn at six o'clock, 
She only saw an empty bed, which did the old girl shack; 
She whom I 
kindly rescued, and who seem'd too weak to stand, 
had bolted off with all the things, on which she could lay hand, 
The blankets and the counterpanes, the workbox and loose 
plate, 
My coat that in the passage hung, likewise shared the same 
fate; 
My landlady looked up at me, exclaiming with a 
jeer, 
" 
Oh, them's the sort of gals you pick up on the Chelsea Pier." 
I've paid for my experience, & c. 
While hunting for my watch and chain, this fact it did reveal 
That which I 
thought a 
vision, to my horror turned out real; 
While I 
was thinking of her, I 
soon found at break of day, 
That she'd been thinking of me in a 
more substantial way. 
She'd thus repaid my kindness, for ' twas pain I 
had been 
sold, 
What's more, I 
was laid up six weeks with such a 
dreadful 
cold ; 
The water of " Old Father Thames " had made me very queer, 
And never more will I 
be seen, again on Chelsea Pier. 
I've pad for my experience, cte

I'd be a 
Butterfly, 
And born in a 
bower, 
Christened in a 
coffee pot, 
And expire in an hour, 
Sooner than be treated 
By a 
pretty girl unkind; 
For Miss Matilda Tickletoby's 
Spoken.— Drivel me out of the pale of society, made me 
nearly kick the bucket. 
Spoiled my peace of mind. 
Spoken.—Spoilell my peace of mind, crushed my young hopes 
and ber-lasted my prospects, and I 
beg leave to inform you con-
fidentially, that— 
CHORUS. 
She served me awfully bad, she did, 
Bad she did, bad, she did, 
She served me dreadfully had, she did, 
That fair but false Matilda. 
Matilda's parents kept a 
shop 
For the sale of coals and taters; 
I 
used to take Matilda out 
To dances and theatres. 
I 
gave her rings and lots of things, 
And a 
curly bow-wow poodle; 
But now, alt ! me, to think that me 
Shall never more " Conoodle.' 
Spoken.—No more conoodleing,, no more tea an 
shrimps, 
ninepence; no more rest, but the grave—the grave for the 
Pilgrim— 
She served me, drc. 
Now there was a 
stuck-up carpenter, 
Who to her lived next door; 
He used to wink his gimlet eye, 
When ever her he saw'er, 
[i] 
I'D BE A BUTTERFLY; [CONCLUDED.] 
OR FAIR BUT FALSE MATILDA. 
It soon became quite plane to me 
Matilda wasn't true, 
She got hammerous to'ords him, tho' I'd 
Have stuck to her like glue. 
Spoken.—This carpenter had more brads than I— thus he 
nailed her; and at the prospect of his chips and being a 
deal 
bored by him— 
She served me, dr,c. 
One day I 
told Matilda, 
For a 
soldier I'd enlist, 
She said it was a 
good idea, 
And that I 
should not be missed. 
This getting my monkey up, and so, 
To be revenged I 
swore; 
When her daddy turned me out, and 
Sweet Matilda slatnnid the door. 
Spoken.—Slamm'd the door—slamm'd the door in lily very 
face; 01 insult to injury— 
She served me, 
I 
wish this chiselling carpenter 
Had long ago been drowned, 
In the Gulf of Carpentaria, 
Ere he'd Matilda found. 
0 
frail, false, fickle woman, 01 
How much you are to blame; 
She's jilted me and I 
hopes that he 
Will serve her just the same.

She served me, &a.

They said, as up in years I 
grew, 
My spirit would grow milder, 
But to confess the truth to you, 
I 
think I've grown much wilder 
I've started a

Its members are " nice boys,"

THE SWELL WITH THE CURLY HAIR. 
By JOHN W . 
LLOYD. 
Some swells often fancy they -re so : aptivating, 
And think that tho girls must in love with them fall ; 
To le tril their mistake is to them aggravating, 
On finding they cause no sensation at all. 
You'll see at a 
glance that my ease differs greatly, 
For I, of attention, get more than my share ; 
For girls in their teens, and old maids tall and stately. 
Make love to the swell with the fine curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Hair! Hair! I've got my share, 
There's nothing so handsome as curly hair; 
The belles of creation, the ladies so fair, 
Make love to the swell with the curly hair. 
There's only one thing that annoys me so greatly, 
While taking a 
stroll, and it's not at all fair; 
The boys in the street I've found out very lately, 
Have a 
habit of shouting out " I'll have your hair," 
It's not at all pleasant, when thus they salute you, 
They, manners and etiquette scorn I 
declare ; 
I 
think, you young rascals, a 
thrashing NVOUld suit you, 
Insulting the swell with the fine curly hair. 
Hair, flair, &c. 
One night to a 
party, I 
being invited, 
To go not reluctant I 
really confess; 
And when I 
arrived all the girls were delighted, 
The reason of course I 
will leave you to guess; 
And e're I 
departed, this is no decept on, 
Although it seems strange, yet it's true I 
declare; 
The ladies there present, without all exception, 
Had fallen in love with my fine curly hair. 
Hair, flair, & a. 
Now if my advice, gents, yen will not be scorning, 
I'll tell you the way to get on with the fair; 
The plan is but simple, take this as a 
warning. 
Believe it, my boys, that there's nothing like hair. 
And if a 
young wife you should try to be finding, 
Your life and your fortunes you wish her to share; 
To captivate her heart and to make the love binding, 
Just raise up a 
crop of this fine curly hair. 
Spoken—Yes, my dear fellows, there's nothing that catches the little 
dears so well as a 
curly head of hair—I 
ought to know—I've tried it 
—and the tetiult of my experience is— 
Hair, Hair, &e.

PADDY .DENNY,AND, _HIS _PIG. 
In Dublin town, with great renown, 
Lived Mr Patrick Denny; 
By Cupid s 
shove, he got in love, 
\Vint a 
lady from Kilkenny. 
She was an Irishman born and bred, 
Her !MOP) was Judy ltafter; 
His love did burst, so he married first, 
And went a 
courting after. 
cc onus. 
'Tis very true what I 
tell you, 
Or else I 
would not bawl now; 
Upon my word and credit, faith, 
You may believe it all now. 
When they did wed, in a 
line flock bed, 
To be sore, tney lay in clove: ; 
And she full soon in the honeymoon, 
Felt strange and queer all over. 
She long'll for tat, for this and that, 
For ale to take her toast in ; 
And what was best among the rust, 
For a 
little pig a-roasting. 
'Tis very true, &c 
To give her aid, he got a 
spade, 
And built her op a 
pig sty ; 
ItailA like a 
pound, and square all round, 
It wasn't a 
very big sty ; 
Says he, don't fret, a 
pig I'll get, 
And one for breeding, fighting; 
No loss I'll gain, ' t 
will ease your pain, 
For the sow will be with kitten. 
'Tis very true, & c. 
But as his purse was all the worse, 
For matrimony searches ; 
To gain his ends he got two friends, 
To join him in his purchase. 
They did agree that both all three, 
Should go halves in the store pi_ ; 
But faith somehow instead of a 
sow, 
They went and bought a 
Boar Pig. 
'Tis very true. 6ce. 
A pig by faith is obstinate, 
And always makes a 
pother; 
And if you say, ' Do go one Nvity," 
He's sure to run the other. 
And Paddy could not get him on, 
13y leading, blows, nt r 
words ; 
So by the tail they pull'd hint ha k, 
And that made him go forward,. 
'Tis very troe. &e
, 
Next morning he got up to see 
If the pig was ' sleep or waking; 
And then he foond him on the ground, 
And in a 
grievous taking. 
His friend was nigh ; says he, "' Twill die 
Tat's sure." 
Says Paddy, " Will it ? 
To stop this strife and save its life, 
I 
think we'd better kill it. 
'Tis very true, & o. 
PADDY DENNY 
.AND HIS PIG.—Consrnap. 
Nov in a 
stew, with a 
bubbnlaboo, 
Before fhe knife did cross flesh ; 
They called the other partner n, 
'Cause he was a 
judge of horse flesh. 
He rubb'd him with some boluses, 
And drench'd h 
m with some ointment 
Told Pat, not to be disappointed, 
At his disappointment. 
'Tis vety true, & c. 
But you know all, a 
pig will squall, 
Like any other vermin; 
And they saw plain. ' twas all in vain. 
Aid to die he did determine. 
So the knife did stick, and made him sick, 
And ended all his riot; 
At first he bled, but when he was dead, 
He lay down very quiet. 
'Tis very true, & c. 
They saw, och hone ! the life was gone, 
And he - was not to boast of ; 
But that the cost might not be lost, 
And the meat to make the most of. 
They putt it in a 
barrow, 
And to market then they roll d 
it; 
And as it did not look like pork, 
For mutton, faith, they sold it. 
'Tie very true, &c. 
Irishmen, twelve out of ten. 
Are all birds of a 
feather; 
And never on such friendly terms, 
As when they fight together. 
And so it proved, for Paddy moved 
By whisky, a 
great flame too; 
He bate them both genteelly, 
And they—served him the sante too, 
'Tis very true, &,c. 
Now Judy all the while got stout, 
And after that got at' uter; 
And when she was decently put to bed, 
With her neighbors all about her. 
To Padif v's joy, she brong-bt a 
boy, 
And oeb ! bow hue was boasting; 
For upon one ey, he had a

And Vother a

THE PET OF THE PANTOMIME. 
Written by J. 
LLOYD. 
To see a 
Pantomime I 
went, 
One night last Christmas time ; 
Attracted by advertisements, 
Pronouncing it sublime. 
I 
occupied a 
handsome box, 
Close by the stage I 
mean; 
From there I 
saw a 
face, alas, 
I 
wish I 
neer had seen. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
loved her most sincerely, 
But Oh! it has cost me dearly; 
Though such a 
beauty really, 
Was this lovely Columbine. 
So graceful, gay, and sprightly, 
She tripped o'er the stage so lightly; 
To see her I 
went nightly, 
She was the Pet of the Pantomime. 
The transformation over, 
When a 
tom d 
of loud applause; 
Rang through the house and on the stage, 
I 
looked to see the cause. 
And there avid(' the motley group, 
And blue fire's sparkling glow; 
I 
saw that lovely Columbine, 
The cause of all my woe. 
For I 
loved her, rim 
Policemen then were bonneted, 
The Pantaloon knocked down; 
I 
heard the people laughing at 
The antics of the Clown. 
But I 
had eyes for none of these, 
But one form I 
could see; 
And that the lovely Colrimbine, 
Who sweetly smiled on rue. - 
For I 
loved her, &a 
sight after night I 
visited 
The house where she perrormed; 
My costly presents, jewels rare, 
lier lovely form adorned. 
To see her bounding o'er the stage, 
Would cause my heart to throb ; 
To see this fair each night I 
paid, 
Exactly twenty bob. 
Spoken—Yes, Gentlemen, it cost me a 
canary every time I 
went to 
see her, that was for the box without extra's of course, .t.ie. t _sari only 
plead in excuse— 
That I 
loved her, & e. 
One night into the Greer. Room, 
I 
made up my mind to go ; 
I 
treated all the actors, 
lint my heart received a 
blow. 
For the Pantaloon informed me, 
As he sipped my brandy down; 
That fair and lovely Columbine, 
Was married to the Clown. 
And I 
loved her, Sze. 
- 
SHE'S LEFT ME WITH THIS BLESSED BABY. 
Parody on ' Maggie May.' 
Down in a 
dirty little court, 
I 
pass my time all day; 
Along with this 'ere blessed kid, 
Since illy wife's gone away. 
She had an awtul jet black eye, 
15poken—I gave her that black cye. 
\Voile whopping her one day; 
But for that cruel act of mine, 
l've dearly had to pay. 
CDOILL*S. 
For site's left me with this blessed baby, 
Squalling all the day; 
Ad 
bolted with a 
chimney sweep, 
Upon the first of May. 
r. 
Shouldn't care it when she'd gone, 
She'd took the kid away; 
it wakes me up all through). the night, 
And bothers ine all day. 
I 
can't be a 
wet noise myself, 
Can t 
pay to put hint out; 
And so I 
have to feed him thro' 
This Unita Pereha spout. 
For she's left me, tc.c. 
The weeks roll by, she don't come back, 
I'll have to cut away; 
The Landlord else will take my sticks, 
The rent I 
cannot pay. 
I 
hope you'll pity my sad case, 
Awl trust you never may 
Be brought to such a 
wretched state; 
As I—through Sally Gray. 
For she's left me, & IL 
TEE LAST SILVER SHILLING. 
Air—" The Last Rose of Summer." 
'Tis the last Silver Shilling 
Before me I 
see; 
All its shining cotnpaniona 
Have spent been by me. 
No coin of its kindred, 
No sixpence is near; 
By its side now to jingle, 
Delightful to hear. 
I'll not leave thee thou bright one 
To stay there alone; 
Since the rest have departed, 
Thou soon wilt be gone. 
Thus kindly I 
take thee, 
Yon gay Bar within; 
'Where thy mate's have been tendered 
.e or three fours of gin. 
Oh, cireln may I 
vanish, 
When Rhino has fled 
And where smiles I 
once witnessl, 
I 
trace frowns instead. 
When ceasing to shine forth 
As once I 
have shone; 
Oh then I 
am thinking 
It's time to be gone, 
BLOW, FOB, BLOW. 
Written by j. W. LLOYD. 
As through the path of life we go, 
How ninny folks 1:ve find; 
Instead of being just and true, 
A.'e selfish and unkind. 
Be affable and kind to all, 
And let your conduct show ; 
You'd rather stretch a 
land to aid, 
Than give a 
blow for blow. 
CHORUS. 
Don't let your angry passions burn, 
incited by a 
foe ; 
But give a 
kind word in return, 
And not a 
blow for blow. 
In argument have caution though 
Your point be strong or weak ; 
Weigh well the subject in your mind, 
Consider 'ere you speak. 
For angry words may lead to blows, 
And insult from a 
frown ; 
You've always an advantage if 
You keep your temper down. 
Don't let your angry, &a. 
If in a 
quarrel you are drawn, 
Your passion you must nurse ; 
Harsh words or blows are no avail, 
But make tho matter worse. 
To look ail insult over, you 
:May find it hard, but yet 
It really is the hest plan. to 
Forgive and th,..n forget. 
Don't let your angry, & c. 
POOR OLD JOE 
Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay, 
Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away ; 
Gone from the earth to a 
better law! 1 k 
now— 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe! 
CliOnt:S. 
I'm coming, I'm coming, my head is bending low, 
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe. 
Why do I 
weep, when my heart should feel no paint 
Why do I 
sigh. that my friends conw not again ? 
Grieving for forms now departed long ago— 
I 
near their gentle voices calling Four old Joe. 
I'm coming, &e. 
Where are the hearts, once so happy and so free? 
The children so dear that I 
held upon my knee? 
Gone to the shore where my soul has longed to go--
I 
hear their gentle voices calling Poor Old Joe! 
I'm coming, &a,

THE SERGEANT OF THE REGIMENT. 
Air.—" The Captain with his Whiskers." 
Oh, they walked up the street, so delightful to view, 
I 
ran down the stairs, to the door quickly flew, 
Such handsome young fellows are not often seen, 
And I'm sure where I 
was you'd have liked to have been; 
'Twas a 
fine sight to view all those soldiers so gay, 
But I saw something finer, I 
really must say, 
My heart beat with rapture, my eyes beamed with glee, 
For the Sergeant of the Regiment gave a 
sly wink at me. 
In the Park the next day, oh the Sergeant was there 
And I 
sank on a 
seat, overwhelmed I 
declare, 
Oh, I 
thought he'd have passed me, but ' twas not to be, 
For he came up and sat on the seat beside me ; 
Oh, I 
ne'er shall forget what my feelings were then, 
In the presence of one of the finest of men, 
Oh, I 
felt I 
could march to the world's end with he, 
For the Sergeant of the Regiment gave a 
sly wink at me. 
But, alas, he is gone, and I 
see not his face, 
Nor that killing moustache on his upper lip trace, 
I 
wander about, and. I 
sigh all the day, 
For that beautiful Sergeant that's far, far away; 
Oh I 
think of the morn when he walked with his men 
And I 
wish in my heart I 
could see him again, 
I'm deeply in love as you plainly can see, 
For the Sergeant of the Regiment gave a 
sly wink at me.
