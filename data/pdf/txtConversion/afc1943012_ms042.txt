July 28, 1943, letter from B.A. Botkin to Willis Laurence
James
July 28, 1943 Dr. Willis Laurence James Fort Valley State College Fort Valley,
Georgia
Dear Dr. James:
I have just received your wire requesting additional disks. We are sending you 25 by air
express this afternoon. Let me remind you that Lewis Jones received 50 disks, the full
quota provided for in our original budget and only 8 of these were returned to us out. For
our records, we must know what happened to the remaining disks.
With best wishes,
Sincerely yours, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
BAB/k
P.S. I think that the project was extended to cover the Festival, so I assume that you will
wind it up by the end of August.
