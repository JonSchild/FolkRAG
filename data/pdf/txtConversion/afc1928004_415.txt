BIOGRAPHICAL 6 
tiETCH. 
OF 
HARRY MONTAG-UE, 
" 
The Artist Comique of the dug." 
HARRY MONTAGUE was born in Philadelphia September 14th, 
4 
1850, and made his first appearance as a 
vocalist in the fall of 
1872, at one of the western theaters, appearing for the balance 
of the season with much success throughout the south and 
west. 
Early in 1873 he determined to go to England; he spent 
several months in London, and had the advantage of hearing al[ 
the great English comic and character singers, in the meantime 
studying hard and improving greatly by what he had seen. 
Ire 
then visited and appeared with much success in the principal 
cities of England, Ireland and Scotland, thence to the Cape of 
Good Hope, thence to Sydney, Melbourne, and the principal 
towns of Australia, where he made a 
tremendous hit. 
From 
Australia he went to Now Zealand, thence to I 
fonoluln, (ifawa-
inn Islands), thence to San Francisco and overland to New York 
City. 
A 
trip unparalleled in its length and success by any 
other comic vocalist in the world. 
Mr. Montague made his debut in New York in 1875, and for 
nine consecutive months was one of the principal vocal stars 
in the metropolis. 
It was at that time lie established himself a 
great favorite with his popular songs" Pull Down the Blind," 
"Something in the City," " I 
Tickled her under the Chin," etc., 
and there is no vocalist to-day who has a 
more extensive reper-
toire of comic, motto, descriptive, or topical songs than tins pop-
ular artist, who always produces something new, with catching 
words and sparkling music. 
As a 
result of the flattering success which attended his efforts 
during his first engagements in New York, he has since played 
in all the principal Variety Theaters throughout the country, 
and he is now considered one of the best " drawing cards" in 
the profession, and managers are always glad to secure his ser-
vices at a 
large salary. 
ONCE more I 
have the honor to offer for your inspection, and, 
I 
trust, your amusement, my latest compositions, together with 
a 
number of those songs which you have already received with 
so much favor; and I 
shall constantly endeavor to merit a 
con-
tinuance of the very kind appreciation that you have always 
bestowed on my humble endeavors to please you. 
IIARRY MONTAGUE. 
Yours truly, 
NEW YORK, March 25, 1818.

IT AGAIN. 
Sung with immense success by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
Music of this song can be obtained from SPEAR & DmiNnOrp, 
717 Broadway, N. Y. 
I've just arrived in town you see, to spend a 
week or two, 
But I've been so vexed since I've been here, I 
don't know what 
to do, 
For everybody says to me no matter - where I 
be, 
And whatever I 
am doing this is what they say to me, 
CitoRuS. 
At it again, at it again, 
You rascal l'm looking your at it again, 
You're a 
naughty young man, I 
see very plain, 
You rascal I'm looking, your at it again. 
I 
took a 
cab when I 
arrived, and drove at once up town, 
And because I'd not pay double fare the "cabby" then did frown 
lie said he'd take me to the Mayor, and of me he'd complain, 
Then the crowd said I 
was cheating, and cried out " you're at 
it again." 
At it again, etc. 
I 
paid him then to go away, and sneaked off very soon, 
And being as it were upset, I 
entered a 
saloon, 
drank three brandies right clean off to ease my troubled brain 
When a 
youngster poked his bead in the door, and cried out 
" 
you're at it again." 
At it again, etc. 
When evening came I 
took a 
stroll, the sights in town to see, 
And I 
met a 
lovely creature, who seemed pleased at meeting 
me. 
We 
walked awhile, and bye- and-bye, in a 
restaurant we went, 
And in a 
cozy little supper room, we soon were quite content. 
Spoken.—We had a 
nice supper together, and after slipper, 
asked the young lady for a 
kiss, and just as she got her dear 
little mouth all puckered up for that delightful sensation, the 
infernal waiter ?aids head in the.door, and shoutedout— 
At it again, etc.

IT TICKLES THE LADIES. 
Sung with tremendous success by HARRY MONTAGUE, " 
the Artist 
Comique of the Day." 
(Music of this song, or of ally of Harry Montague's popular compo-
sitions,can be obtained from SPEAR 
DEnNuoFF,717 Broadway, N.Y.) 
Fellows may be better looking, 
Richer, wiser than myself, 
But I've a 
gift I 
greatly value, 
More than beauty, sense, or pelf; 
For I 
possess a 
style and manner, 
Loved by ev'ry girl I 
see, 
A 
flirting, teasing, pleasing way—that 
Tickles them and just suits me. 
Sr'oxEK.—Just my little peculiarity, a 
style of my own that tickles 
them. I 
don't know what it. is, you know, but there's something 
about me they like, because  
CHORU-S. 
It tickles the ladies immensely, you know! . 
It tickles the ladies, wherever I 
go; • 
It tickles the ladies, they like it, and so— 
They think I 
shall marry—but—oh I 
dear no! 
In position quite romantic 
With my hand my heart upon, 
I 
sigh, as though I'd lost the power 
Of ar-ti-cu-la-ti-on ! 
Then, in tones as low and gentle 
As a 
cooing turtle dove, 
Say—well— something sentimental, 
Look—but do not speak my love. 
SPOKEN.—That's how it's done, this spooney business tickles them 
—and they are in no hurry for you to come to the point; they flon't 
care for it to be too soon over for the longer a 
flirtation lasts, the 
more 
It tickles the ladies, etc. 
Though my heart with love may tingle, 
I 
ne'er lose my hand or head, 
For I 
know I 
must keep single, 
I 
should lose my power if wed. 
Though I 
might be still as pleasing, 
Still as youthful, fond, and gay; 
I 
should find the charm was broken 
From the fatal wedding day. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it would be an up, the sport would be over, the bird 
would be caged, and nobody but my better-half would admit, that— 
It tickles the ladies, etc_

HUMAN NATURE. 
Sung with great success, by the immensely popular Vocal 
Comedian, HARRY MONTAGUE. 
(Music of this or of any of HARRY MONTAGUE'S compositions, can 
can be obtained from SPEAR lc DEHNHOFF, 717 Broad— 
way, N. Y.) 
Oh, here's a 
shocking sample of poor humanity, 
Now take a 
sad example from the specimen you see. 
And always satisfy yourself with what belongs to yot., 
And don't go coveting another man's wife, or another man's 
darling Lou. 
SPOKEN.—Lou—Louisa--now you see I'm in love with Lou, 
but I 
have no right to be, for I'm married; but I 
always want 
what I 
ca t 
get, and I 
generally get what I 
don't want, but 
we're all Alike, for— 
CHORUS. 
It's only human nature after all, 
I 
really cannot help myself at all 
It's only human nature, fickle human nature, 
Tits only human nature after all. 
Louisa is proud and haughty, while I'm of low degree; 
She's on the shady side of forty, while I 
am twenty-three. 
Louisa she has heaps of cash, while I'm not worth a 
son, 
So you may guess there isn't a 
chance for a 
fellow to be loved 
by Lou. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, Louisa has got plenty of money. 
Now I 
sup-
pose that if Lou was my wife, ,and my wife was Lou, that I'd 
fall in love with my own wife; but we're both married, that is, 
I 
am married and so is Louisa, but, unfortunately we are mar-
ried to the wrong people. 
Well— 
It's only human, etc. 
My wife is such a 
tartar, and she leads me such a 
life, 
I 
wish that I 
could " shake " her, and say Ta-Ta to my wife, 
For an aggravating one is she, with such a 
temper too, 
And you can bet there'd be a 
row, if she knew that I 
loved 
Lou. 
SPOKEN.—Well if my wife knew that I 
loved Lou, she',T. 
lose her temper, and Lou would lose her back hair, see? for— 
It's only human, etc. 
Oh human nature fickle, it seems to be your plan 
To lead into a 
pickle every discontented man. 
You make us think we want a 
lot, that we've not had before, 
And then whedeer our desires wo'vo got, we're in trnnhin till 
we get some more. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it's the same all over the world, the more we 
get the more we want, for— 
It's only human, etc.

I've just got wed to a 
darling wife, 
We're happy as can be. 
There's only one thing causes strife, 
Of which we can't agree. 
For now and then, like the best of men, 
I 
go out in a 
jovial way, 
And as sure as fate if I 
come home late. 
My wife to me will say: 
CHORUS. 
Where have you been to- night, John, 
Where have you been to-night; 
You're out so late, and in such a 
state; 
Where have you been to-night, John. 
(Repeat.) 
When I 
go out for an hour or so, 
The time it slips by so fast, 
It's time to go befoDe I 
know 
A 
jolly night has passed. 
lip-stairs.T creep; she's fast asleep, 
I 
think I 
hear her snore— 
What a 
sad mistake—she's wide awake, 
When she says to nie once more— 
Where have you, etc. 
12 
At one or two—or it may be three— 
I 
quit the festive scene. 
And then my wife will say to me, 
Now tell me where you've been. 
You're out so late—in such a 
state— 
You're not yourself, I 
vow. 
How strange you talk, how queer you walk; 
You really don't know how. 
Spoken.—And just as soon as I 
get into the bedroom, my 
wife said tome: " This is a 
nice time to be coming home, isn't 
it? 
You thought you'd leave your boots outside in the hall, 
and sneak in here and I 
wouldn't know what time you came 
home; but I'm not such a 
fool as I 
look, although goodness 
knows I 
was a 
fool when I 
married you; 
but there, John, 
I didn't want to fight with you or quarrel, so there's a 
good dear, hurry up and come to bed; and tell me darl-
ing— 
Where have you, etc.

NEVER MIND ME, 
Sung with overwhelming success by HARRY MONTAGUE 
the 
Some people when they're wanted are never near the spot, 
While others they are in the way, when wanted they are not. 
Now I 
am most unlucky, I'm always in the way, 
So I 
fear it's quite by accident, and so I 
have to say— 
CHORUS. 
Never mind me, I 
can't see 
Don't mind me, I'm not looking, 
Never mind me, I 
can't see, 
Don't mind me for I 
won t 
look. 
Last summer I 
went in the park, the place for happy days; 
And after seeing all I 
could, I 
strolled into the maze. 
I 
suddenly came on a 
couple, very much engaged, 
I 
fear I 
spoiled their little game, for they were quite enraged, 
Spoken.—Well, of course, there is no harm in a 
loving couple 
going in the park; but its not exactly the place for a 
gentleman 
to be caught with his arms round a 
lady's waist. 
So I 
could 
see that this tender couple felt very much embarrassed at my 
sudden appearance, so I 
excused myself, and said to them— 
Never mind me, etc. 
I 
like a 
stroll up town, I 
do, and so the other day 
I 
lit a 
weed, and took a 
walk just out of Broadway, 
And by a 
stoop I 
saw a 
girl, the kind of whom we dream, 
She had one foot up, and on seeing me, she blushed and gave a 
scream. 
Spoken.—My usual luck, I 
passed by at the wrong moment, 
just as the young lady was tying her shoe- string; so I 
took an 
extra puff on my cigar and says to her— 
Never mind me, etc. 
My old friend, Peter Henpeck, has got a 
fistic wife, 
She bangs her " fives " on his " conk," and loads him such 
life. 
I 
chanced to stop in 'tether day, to see what they were at, 
She had knocked poor Peter down, and they were fighting on 
The mat. 
Spoken.—Yes, there they were, fighting on the front door-
mat; well, the fact is, this couple don't get along very well to-
gether, and whenever they have one of their " family broils," 
Peter always comes out second best; now I 
never like to in-
terfere between man and wife whenever they have any trouble, 
so I 
said to this happy pair: " Take it easy, Peter," " jump 
on his chest, madam."— 
Sung with immense success, by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
(Music of this popular song can be obtained from SPEAR 
DEHNHOFF, 717 Broadway, New York, Harry Montague's sole 
publishers.) 
I'm a 
victim of fate, now my woes I'll relate, 
You'll really be sorry for me, 
For when sorrow I 
sup, next day I 
get up, 
Then I 
have it for dinner and tea. 
Sonic folks take their ills, one by one, just like pills, 
• 
But I 
usually swallow the box. 
First it rains, then it pours misfortunes by scores, 
And calamities follow in flocks. 
CH ORUS. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Troubles and bothers, one after the other, 
Still they come, still they come— 
There's nothing but trouble for me. 
I 
wish I'd been dead on- the day I 
got wed, 
'Twould have saved me a 
terrible life, 
For nobody knows what I 
could disclose 
Concerning the friends of my wife— 
There's my mother-in-law, and her sisters a 
score, 
And relations a 
wonderful share. 
They conic, and they stay, and they won't go away 
For no matter how many are there. 
CHORUS. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Uncles and cousins, and aunts by the dozen. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Boarding and lodging with me. 
once thought I'd enjoy, a 
sweet baby boy, 
To cheer me, and cause me delight. 
I
. 
didn't mind two, and with four I 
could do, 
And I 
thought that with six I 
was right ; 
I 
put up with my fate when the number was eight, 
But the tenth brought me sorrow and woe, 
For now she begins—just think I 
to have twins, 
Although I 
may try all I 
know. 
CHORUS. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Doctors and nurses, and babies; I 
cusses 
Still they come, still they come— 
A very large family for me.

Well there, now ! did you ever ? 
Ma says I'm dreadful bold, 
Because when men come ccurting, 
I'm .. ot reserv'd or cold. 
Now, gents, pray tell me, would you have me 
Make a 
face that's wry ? 
Or when you ask me once to kiss you, 
Like a 
fool to cry ? 
SPOKEN.—No, no! I'm sure you would rather I'd say — 
CHORUS. 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Bless me, Bob, don't be so shy; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Once more only love to try; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
'Tis the height of true love's bliss; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
No joy equals love's fond kiss. 
Bob says not to mind mother, 
When she was young like me 
She ne'er tho't men a 
bother, 
Or married would not be; 
And so I 
thought if men would follow, 
I'd not say them nay. 
Nor for my mother, or any other, 
Bid them turn away. 
SPOKEN.—But I've made up my mind that when the right one 
comes along, I'll  say — 
Keep on kissing me, etc. 
I 
think that Bob means business, 
Tho' not much yet he's said, 
But truly, from his actions, 
I 
think he means to wed. 
Now should he ask me if I'll have him, 
I'll not bid him wait, 
And say the sea holds plenty fishes, 
For oft we lose our bait. 
SPoKEN.--LOh, yes, I 
tell you, these giddy girls who keep 
saying, " There's just as good fish in the sea as ever were 
caught!" they forget that sometimes they lose their bait. 
Not 
for me! 
Oh, no! 
I'll continue saying — 
Keep on kissing me, etc.

HE ISN'T A MARRYING MAN.

Th"re's a 
charming young fellow now roaming about, 
Who loves all the girk in his way. 
Thv say he's a " catch," but of that there's a 
doubt, 
.-'or a 
single young man he will stay. 
He flirts, and sighs, and tells such lies, 
Each one is sure she has a 
prize; 
kt.d he has such a 
naughty way, 
.0: 
That one girl to another will say, beware, beware, beware. 
CHORUS. 
He isn't a 
marrying man, my love 
He lives on a 
different plan, my love. 
Keep out ot his way, if you can, my love, 
For he isn't a 
marrying man. 
'."here's old Mrs. Brown, with a 
daughter so sweet, 
She thought him an excellent beau, 
he alloyed Mary Jane his attentions to meet, 
And told her to never say " No

I'm not satisfied at all 
With what I

I

As deep as deep can be; 
But sure enough I

The girl don't care for me.

That she might ride in me. 
I

And she would go to bathe ; 
If she would drown I'd surely try, 
My loved one's life to save. 
By her hair, or the soles of her feet,

I'd live, and love, and die in peace, 
And never go to sea any more.

Pastor's Theatre. 
(All rights reserved.) 
I'm happy Lou, and I 
go through 
The world in merry style, 
I 
don't see why a 
girl should cry, 
It's just as well to smile. 
Some people fret their lives away, 
Which I 
shall never do, 
For rain or shine, I 
d 
n't repine, 
There's nothing troubles Lou. 
Louisa's not to be put out, 
I 
plainly caution you, 
Do what you will, I 
answer still, 
There's nothing troubles Lou. 
Some call me pet and gay coquette, 
And say my heart is stone, 
WhiCi is not right, tho' I 
delight 
In teasing, I 
must own. 
Perhaps I 
pert, perhaps I 
flirt, 
Which ladies often do, 
But as to beaus, why goodness knows, 
They never trouble Lou. 
Louisa's not to be put out, &C. 
My sweetheart, Fred, has often said 
(Anil then a 
kiss he cribs), 
You love me Lou, you know you do, 
So don't tell little fibs. 
But I 
say, tho' you bother so, 
You shall not bling me too, 
So you may tease, just as you please, 
There's nothing troubles Lou. 
Louisa's not to be put out, Le. 
Lastinight he brought a 
ring he'd bought, 
And slyly said to me, 
Now as I 
bring my Lou a 
ring, 
Al-luring it might be, 
I 
smiled and said, well really Fred 
I 
don't know what to do, 
But as you say you've fixed the day, 
Why you may marry Lou.

think very nice 
What I

W-hen the weather's proper, I'm ready in a

To take my usual walk out on Sunday. 
A 
drive out in a " trap" now some folks seem to prize, 
But the exercise of walking I 
would much advise, 
And oh, such funny sights, and oh such horrid guys 
You meet with when you're walking out on Sunday. 
CHORUS. 
Walking out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Crawling out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
Driving out on Sunday in the afternoon, 
It's awful jolly walking out on Sunday. 
Now there's Augustus Tompkins, a 
very heavy swell, 
lie manages to live somewhere on Murray Hill, 
You'd take him for a 
banker or a 
broker down on Wall street 
When he crawls out to do his walk on Sunday, 
With his silver-headed cane, and a 
glass stuck in one eye 
lie twirls his tine moustache, which suspicious looks of dye, 
in fact you seldom see, se elegant a 
guy,

JUST TO PLEASE THE BOYS, 
Sung with great success in the principal Variety Theaters 
throughout the country by the DUNCAN SISTERS, 
CARRIE AND SOPHIE. 
THE subject of the songs to- day 
Is " Violets Dipped in Dew," 
And " Take, Oh take those Lips Away," 
And" Laughing Eyes so Blue." 
I 
know these songs are just the thing 
To please and bring us joys, 
But what I 
Trow intend to sing 
Is " Just to Please the Boys." 
CHORUS. 
Just to please the boys, 
Just to please the boys 
I've made my mind, and feel inclined 
To try and please the boys. 
To all young men who seek a 
wife, 
Before they are betrayed, 
I'd gladly give some good advice' 
For beauty soon will fade. 
Don't fall in love with all you see, 
Pure gold has no alloy; 
Their winning smiles, you must agree. 
Is just to please the boys. 
Just to please the boys, etc. 
Some girls you see upon the street 
Are but a 
fleeting show; 
Don't cast your fond hearts at their feet. 
They're not all pure as snow. 
And now, young men, I 
hope you'll learn 
To shun the world's decoys, 
And recollect that what I've said 
Was just to please the boys. 
Just to please the boys, etc.

THE SWELL ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE. 
Sung with immense success by the great Comic Genius, HARRY 
MONTAGUR. 
I 
AM upon the Stock Exchange 
And deal in stocks and shares, 
And men must be uncommon sharp 
To catch me unawares. 
All that I 
touch turns into gold, 
That's why I'm such a 
swell. 
I 
know exactly when to buy, 
And always when to sell. 
CTIORUS. 
I'm a 
swell on the Stock Exchange; 
As through the streets I 
range 
Folks say, " How funny, he's rolling in money, 
The swell on the Stock Exchange." 
Of course you've heard of Bulls and Bears, 
But none with me compare. 
And when a 
Bull,—to make a 
"Bulls," 
A 
thing I 
can't a 
Bear. 
I'm often called a 
sportive cuss, 
And one who's pretty keen. 
And though I'm not at all a 
lamb, 
I 
gambol on the green. 
I'm a 
swell, etc. 
My luck prevails, yet other folks 
Misfortune cannot shun, 
They have to sell up everything, 
And sometimes cut and run. 
My secret they can't gauge, its clear, 
Till all their cash has flown. 
I 
speculate with others' coin, 
They only risk their own. 
I'm a 
swell, etc.

MONEY WILL ALWAYS FIND FRIENDS, 
Sung with great success all over the country by HARRY 
MONTAGUE. 
THOUGH sad the appearance I 
make to you now, 
Well up I 
have been in my time; 
But stony and cold has the world been of late, 
And poverty still seems a 
crime. 
I 
have found out with bitter experience this: 
Without money you soon will decay, 
And those who you thought you could count as your friends, 
When wanted were always away. 
CHORUS. 
If poor you will find it a 
terrible crime, 
For poverty often offends; 
But if you are wealthy, how different then-
For money will always find friends. 
When I 
kept a 
fine house and parties could give 
In a 
style that's been seldom before, 
Friends I 
could find in plenty, of course; 
Their numbers I 
could count by the score. 
But now if I 
meet them and ask them for help, 
With a 
shrug of the shoulder they say: 
Excuse me just now; I'll see you again I" 
And nodding, they shuffle away. 
If poor, you will find, etc. 
Perhaps the dark cloud that's been hanging o'erhead 
Will fade, and its place become bright; 
And fortune, though fickle, will smile once again 
On this most deplorable wight. 
And if but again I 
have wealth at command, 
I'll pay back to those with a 
frown 
Who ought to have helped a 
friend when in need, 
And not kicked him because he was down. 
If poor, you will find, etc.

And dance the Landers too.

variety theatres of New York City. 
(ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.) 
IF 
I 
only had my way, 
In this bright land of ours, 
There's many things I'd like to do, 
If I 
only had the power— 
I'd have no care or grief 
To worry us each day, 
I'd make all folks contented, 
If I 
only had my way. 
Our laws should be the !same 
For the rich man and the poor, 
Our banks and instutions 
Should be solid to the core, 
And as regards our navy, 
To the government I 
would say, 
Don't send any damaged ships to sea, 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
If I 
only had my way, 
Eight hours should be a 
fair day's work, 
And bosses they should pay 
Liberal wages to all, 
Now this I 
think you'll say, 
Is the very best thing that I 
could do 
If I 
only had my way. 
Street improvements I 
would make, 
And railroads I'd complete, 
I'd lower the price of coal, 
And everything we eat, 
And to those who had great wealth, 
29 
To them I 
now would say, 
Just you share that with the poor man, 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
If I 
only had my way, 
All you batchelors should be married, 
And that without delay, 
And for all you girls I'd find 
A 
husband true and kind, 
And I'd marry all the old maids 
To some sharp and gay young sports. 
If I 
only had my way, 
To married folks I'd say, 
Now live in peace and happiness, 
Each year, each month, each day, 
And never let trouble come 
To lead man and wife astray, 
I'd close up all divorce courts 
If I 
only had my way. 
If I 
only had my way, 
Our manager he should call 
For champagne, brandy, wine, cigars, 
Enough to treat you all, 
And the leader of our band, 
A 
jolly good fellow is he, 
We'll all go over to Boston 
And have a 
jolly spree. 
And now I'll say good-night, 
If you like my little rhymes 
Pray let your kind applause 
Upon my efforts whine, 
For the more applause I 
get, 
The more money to me they pay; 
I'd sing you a 
song about four miles long 
If I 
only had my way.

I 
got married you see about six months ago 
To a 
handsome young fellow I 
loved, 
For I 
thought hint perfection, and all that was good, 
And he called me his dear, darling dove, 
But last night we quarrelled like married folks do, 
And he says he don't love me at all, 
So then I 
got angry and to him I 
said 
That I 
would go home to my ma. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I'll go home to ma, 
Yes, I'll go home to ma, 
I 
say what I 
mean, and I 
mean what I 
say 
That I'm going home to mama, 
So this morning he said he would never speak cross 
And our troubles we settled quite soon, 
And we never will light as to who shall he boss 
In our cheerful and bright happy home; 
Now ladle pray lister tc what I've to say 
If your husbands stay out late at night, 
You can bring them around the very next day 
If you threaten to go home to ma.

Oh no, I.

Oh no, I'll never marry! no man shall call me wife,

Oh no, I'll never marry ! I'd rather spend my life

If love were only lasting, so easily obtained. 
Oh no, I'll never marry, (Ire. 
Oh no, I'll never marry ! for love that in the spring

IT'S EXCEEDINGLY AWKWARD FOR ME. 
(Cop.) right. ) 
Written and composed by HARRY MONTAGUE, and sung by 
him with the greatest success at Tony Pastor's Theatre, New 
York. 
SOME people do say, if you marry in haste 
At leisure your sure to repent. 
I 
assure you of such things I've had quite a 
taste 
And I 
certainly to it assent. 
Now, the wrong girl I 
happened to marry one day 
However strange that seems to be, 
But they both love me still, and that makes it you know 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
CHORUS. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, 
Very awkward for me. 
I 
love both these girls, 
I 
do, 'pon my word--
It'a exceedingly awkward for me. 
Now, one of them was a 
most beautiful blonde, 
The other a 
lovely brunettee, 
And aoth of them seemed of me very fond, 
And the sact is they seem to be yet. 
Now which of the two did love me the best 
Seemed the greatest of mysteries to be, 
While I 
loved them both, and that made it you know 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, .'17 c. 
I 
at last married one, and from that very day 
I 
date all my trouble and woe, 
Rr when we went out, these two always would meet 
No matter wherever we'd go, 
And they both would glare at each other, for each 
Was as jealous as jealous could be, 
And w en we'd get home my wile would make it 
Exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, Lc. 
Now, which of the two really loved e 
the best, 
I 
determined at last should be found, 
So a 
friend of mine went to them both, with this yarn, 
And told them that I 
had been drowned ; 
Of course 'twas a 
job that we both did arrange. 
And I 
know that you all will agree,• 
For had I 
really been drowned, ' twould have been strange 
And exceedingly a,wkw..rd for me. 
It's exceedite2ly awkward for me, Sz,c. 
When my wife heard the news she exclaimet., 
Oh, my! 
Are you sure he will never come back; 
I 
feel very sorry, I'm sure I 
could cry, 
For I 
look like a 
fright dressed in black; 
And then I'll be kept in the house for a 
year 
And no company be able to see; 
How mean to die now for I've just bought some new clothes 
Oh, it's exceedingly awkward for me." 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, Sze. 
Now, when the maiden whom I 
should have wed heard the 
news, 
She cried, and did bitterly weep, 
And said that she wished that she was dead so that she 
In the grave with her darling might sleep. 
I 
well knew them who loved me the best, 
And wished I 
unm Tried might be; 
But I'm tied all my life to an unloving wife, 
Which is exceedingly awkward for me. 
It's exceedingly awkward for me, az.

few weeks ago 
In a 
Madison Avenue stage, 
Her style and her figure it pleased me you know 
She was just about the right age. 
As we were alone, I 
suggested to her 
In terms quite polite and refined, 
Tht. I'd be most happy to see her safe home, 
She said yes, if you'll be so kind. 
SPOKEN.—So I 
took the young lady to her home, she invited 
no in, and I 
spent a very pleasant evening, and just before I

CHORUS. 
I 
tickled her under the chin 
Repeat—I 
ticklA again and again 
Sh.. did no, say no, she liked it you know 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
I 
called by appointment to see her next day, 
And asked her if she'd take a 
drive, 
She said I'm delighted, that's just what I 
want 
And in a 
moment was close by my side. 
Now driving you know, marc- , your appetite keen 
So when we got bacs, to Dehnonico's we wont, 
And I 
ordered some oysters ?,11.1 wine. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we had a delightful super together, 
f.ter supper when the wine commenced to make her ehook8 
'eq., 
I 
reached across the table, and I 
Tickled her wider "clao 
Now I 
see her quite often, and you wont be surprised 
That our friendship ripened so fast, 
For I 
found that in her, I 
really had met, 
A 
dear, darling creature at last, 
And our love grows stronger, day after day, 
We're going to be married next June, 
And it all came about, through that queer little way, 
That I 
tickled her under the chin. 
SPOKEN.—So 
last night when she bid me good bye, at tho 
front door, she said Charley, you dear good fellow, I'll never for-
get the first time that you— 
Tickled inc under the chin, 
That you tickled me under the chin, 
I 
didn't say no, for I 
liked it you know, 
When you tickled me under the chin, 
When I 
tickle her under the chin, 
I 
tickled again and again, 
She did not say no, for she liked it you know, 
When I 
tickled her under the chin. 
6POKEN.—This is the moral of the story: 
You all have a 
chance for adventures like this, 
With the charming young ladies you meet, 
And you'll find on an average that live out of ten 
Won't object to a 
drive and a 
treat; 
But pray let me give you one piece of advice, 
When a 
girl's loving kiss you would win, 
Just do it quite gently and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin. 
CHORUS. 
When you tickle her under the chin, 
ferpeat—When you tickle her under the chin, 
Just do it quite gently and don't be too rough, 
When you tickle her under the chin.

There's a 
maxim I 
can give, 
Simple, clear, and true, 
Teaching you the way to live, 
Showing what to do. 
Stand by this where'er you go, 
Wheresoe'er you dwell, 
Be your station high or low, 
" 
Do your duty well " 
CHORUS. 
If you would from care be free, 
Every grief dispel, 
Let your motto ever be 
" 
Do your duty well." 
If you rule yourself aright, 
If you persevere, 
You may make the future bright, 
Though the past be &ear; 
Every man must play his part, 
Sorrow comes to all, 
But a 
light and cheerful heart 
Makes the trouble small. 
Don't let envy fill your mind, 
If upon the road, 
You should meet a 
friend and find, 
His a 
lighter load. 
Though you have more hardly faired, 
Lessons you will learn, 
Which will make you well prepared 
When the tide shall turn.

I 
ENTERED the Park on a 
beautiful evening, 
To bask in the pleasures that nature had strewn, 
With a 
bounteous hand fur the rich and the poor man, 
Where flowers nestle closely in verdure's full bloom. 
A 
policeman was there, and I 
asked his perniksi ii 
To wander around through the Park with the mass 
Of the people. lie answered yes, walk at your leisure, 
But be careful oung man, and keep off the grass. 
Cnoau4. 
Keep off the grass, keep off the grass ; 
Mind what I 
tell you, if I 
lot you pass 
Keep off the grass, keep off the grass , 
I'll bid you good evening, but keep oft the grass. 
Now I 
hadn't gone far when I 
met a 
fair charmer— 
A 
beautiful, gushing, dear little maid. 
I 
raised my chapeau, and addressed her quite blandly, 
me she'd I 
roinew de. 
And asked her if 
it 
She smiled and looked sweet when I 
asked hi r 
this question, 
If strolling with inc half an hour she would pass, 
So sweetly she answered, " Yes, sir, with pleasure, 
I'll stroll by your side if you keep off the grass " 
Keep t 
fl the grass, &c. 
Boon after we wete married, and quickly I 
found out 
That I 
had caught a 
tartar, you bet, 
Although in some things I 
du think she's perfection, 
Yet I 
often do wish that we never bail met. 
Last week I 
saw that policeman one morning, 
And I 
told him of my troubles since wedding this hiss, 
But he laughed at me, when lie repeated his warning, 
" 
I 
told you, young fellow, to keep off the grass." 
SPOKEN. —NOW, boys, take my advice, whenever you are 
strolling in the Park, and get up a 
nice little flirtation with a 
pretty girl. 
Just take my advice, and— 
Keep off the grass, &c.

The girls have much to answer for, 
By the way in which they tease, 
And twirl us ' round their fingers, 
And do just as they please. 
I'm suffering just at present 
From one who's most unkind, 
She keeps me on a

And won't make tin her mind.

And what is more absurd,

Sometimes we go to parties, 
Where she's a 
well-known flirt; 
Then she says there is no harm, 
But I 
feel 80 awfully hurt— 
try to read her every thought, 
And watch her every glance, 
Each morning, noon, and night, 
Whene'er I 
have the chance. 
SPOKEN.—I 
whisper in her car the same old story of--
Henrietta I 
etc. 
If she'd only give a 
whisper; 
If she'd say that little—Yes— 
Then I'd feel in Paradise, 
And my fate I 
then could gueis. 
But in neither words nor ways, 
Her consent I 
cannot trace, 
And if I 
break my promise, 
There is a " breach of promise case."

wouldn't need to say any more —

We've tasted of the ups of life, we've also felt its downs; 
Sometimes our pockets were quite full, but sometimes fortu-e

And be our drink bright, sparkling wine, or simply good, plain

The grasp of friendship is the same, through each succeeding

At eight years of age, although not a

I

So the school teacher gave the old lecture to me: 
You may look, etc, 
When I 
grew a 
young man, I 
loved a 
sweet maid, 
And although she loved me, she was rather too staid. 
I 
dared not embrace I.er, or ask for a 
kiss, 
If I 
did, the reply from my love would be this: 
You may look, etc 
When we were engaged, r:aid, No one could blame, 
So her scruples hi tl nit way I

Under the rose-bush, under the rose- bush,

Of modesty heedless, in fact it was needless, 
We sat by the side of that May- bedecked hedge, 
I 
heard his confession of love and depression, 
He asked for a 
kiss in exchange for the pledge, 
I 
never denied it, but then and there tried it, 
Beneath that bright- rose busl full burdened with bloom, 
So like the May flowers, which served as a 
bower, 
It scorned quite as sweet as the lovely perfmne. 
Under the rose-bush, & c. 
At sun's early dawning, I 
went there each morning 
To meet my romantic and strangely met swain, 
All mystery was banished, all secrecy vanished 
Dear Ned vowed he'd 10V0 me again and again.

SOME people you'll find always railing at fate, 
Declaring with many a 
sigh, 
That luck is against them, they cannot get on, 
And so it is useless to try. 
They're hopeful enough, and feel sure of success 
When they find things look all bright and fair, 
But the first little trouble that comes in the way 
They're sure to give up in despair. 
SPOKEN. — Despair! 
Don't have such a 
word in your diction-

And don't give it up mind, when once you begin. 
Trouble may meet you, 
And try to defeat you, 
But don't let it beat you; no, go in and win. 
Now plenty you'll find always talking about 
The wonderful things they will do, 
And if talking would do it, there isn't a 
doubt 
That they would astonish a 
few; 
They're always intending to do something great, 
But not quite sure how to begin, 
And while they are thinking how its to be done,

fellow in love with a 
girl, 
And would like to make her his wife, 
But he tells you he hardly dare think about that, 
For she's rather above him in life.

Her station don't matter a 
pin. 
Just make up your mind that you'll have her, my Loy, 
And you've only to go in and win.

Go in and win, etc.

That you'll not be left in the rear. 
Be certain you mu A 
keep well up to the fore

Fortune, you know, only favors the brave, 
So if with a 
stout heart you begin 
There's no fear I'm sure, but that you'll pull through, 
You've only to go in and win

Tuts world of ours goes round and round, 
The same thing over again; 
The sun comes up, and the sun goes down, 
The same sun over again; 
And under that sun there is nothing new. 
'Tis said, and so I've found it true, 
This life of ours, ' tween me and you, 
Is the same thing over again. 
'Tis the same thing over again, 
The same thing over again; 
As the world goes round it will surely be found 
The same thing over again. 
Our parents they once were children, you know, 
'Tis the same thing over again; 
What they did once, we do now, 
The same thing over again. 
They loved when shy Cupid his arrow would shoot, 
And of that love we are surely the fruit; 
Now often the old ones we follow suit 
At the same thing over again. 
'Tis the same thing, etc. 
• 
To be all alone with your darling is bliss, 
'Tis the same thing over again; 
When nobody's looking, you steal a 
sly kiss, 
From the same place over again. 
In billing and cooing the time flies away ; 
You've said all you know, the same day after day, 
Von say, " What shall we do now?" she s:yly will say, 
The same thing over again!" 
'Tis the same thing, etc. 
We join in a 
glass with some jovial ' brick," 
The same thing over again; 
Our language in time gets remarkably " thick," 
Too much " Same thing over again!"

KEEP IT DARK. 
Sung in all the principal Variety Theaters throughout the coml.. 
try, with tremendous success, by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
THE sun was shining at twelve at night, 
Keep it dark! 
When this individual first came to light, 
Keep it dark! 
My mother deserted me, how could she do it? 
My father he landed me one with his boot ; 
Some are brought up by hand—I 
was brought up by foot. 
Keep it dark! 
You can safely believe every tale that I 
tell, 
Keep it dark! 
For I 
never tell truth if a 
lie does as well, 
Keep it dark! 
At school my romancing got inc in a 
mess, 
For I 
was so untruthful, I 
blush to confess, 
Schoolmaster advised me to write for the press. 
Keep it dark 
The ladies wear dresses remarkably tight, 
Keep it dark! 
Their beautiful forms are developed to sight, 
Keep it dark!

For the very best way to bamboozle mankind. 
Keep it dark I 
I'll let you off easily, just for a 
treat, 
Keep it dark I 
And I'll tell you some news the next time we meet, 
Keep it dark! 
If you don't quite agree with the things that I 
say, 
With my rhymes on the times in my topical way, 
I 
can easily alter them sonic other day. 
But keep it dark I
