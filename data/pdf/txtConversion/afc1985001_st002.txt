Jack Bryant Firebaugh, 1940
We were out in Arizona On the Painted Desert ground We had no place to call our own
home And work could not be found.
We started to California But our money , h it didn't last long I want to be in Oklahoma Be
back in my old home.
A way out on the desert Where water is hard to find It's a hundred miles to Tempe And the
wind blows all the time.
You will burn up in the day time Yet you're cold when the sun goes down I wanna be in
Oklahoma Be back in my home town.
You people in Oklahoma If you ever come west Have your pockets full of money And you
better be well dressed.
If you wind up on the desert You're gonna wish that you were dead You'll be longing for
Oklahoma And your good old feather bed.
