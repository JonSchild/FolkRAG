Interview conducted by Katelyn Reuther 
Gaby Lee is the founder and owner of Lunaria Flower Farm in Pescadero, California. 
This was a 
remote interview conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaby Lee joined the 
interview from Pescadero, California, and Katie Reuther joined from Boston, Massachusetts.

Introductions 
00:00:31 
Gaby's parents, both from Hong Kong, immigrated to Canada before making their 
way to the San Francisco Bay Area where Gaby grew up. Growing up, a 
lot of 
Gaby's life revolved around food. She was fortunate to be raised with a 
lot of 
Chinese food. Her dad is a 
great cook, and she also had a 
Chinese caretaker 
who cooked Chinese food for them. The caretaker would take Gaby with her to 
Chinatown to go grocery shopping. Gaby recalls watching her select different 
fruits, vegetables, and live fish, and says these experiences made a 
big impression. 
Gaby didn't realize she missed Chinese food until she went to college. She 
remembers going to Chinese school on Saturday mornings in Oakland Chinatown 
and getting dim sum afterwards. She was sick of it at the time, but as soon as she 
went to school where there was very little Chinese food around, she missed the 
flavors. 
Gaby was also raised around Chinese medicine. Although it wasn't a 
dominant 
part of her childhood, she was definitely exposed to it. She played soccer growing 
up, and she remembers her parents taking her to a 
Chinese medicine doctor after 
she sprained her ankle. He would mash a 
number of ingredients together to make 
a 
poultice for her ankle. Sometimes she would also be made to drink bitter teas. 
Now, Gaby wishes she knew what all of the plants were. 
When she was in high school, Gaby's parents also became interested in qi gong 
and practiced energy healing. They didn't try to get her into it, but she was 
exposed to it. She had a 
basic understanding of qi and energy and how it moves

through our bodies. It took time to find her own way into it and incorporate it into 
her life philosophy and the way she interacts with the world. 
00:05:27 
Four or five years ago, Gaby started learning about herbalism. While working on 
farms, some of her colleagues had an interest in herbs, making their own 
medicine, and the practices of folk medicine. She started looking out for that 
information and learning more through friends. Gaby also began to explore basic 
ways to boost her immune system and improve her sleep. 
Learning more about growing plants and being exposed to a 
lot of different kinds 
of plants on farms made her interested in their many different uses. She found it 
cool that people had been using plants for so long as natural remedies, and she 
liked the idea of not needing to be reliant on a 
more traditional medicinal system. 
Instead, she liked the idea of having relationships with plants over time and using 
them for more long-term health benefits. 
As Gaby was learning about more western herbs, she began learning a 
little bit 
about Chinese herbs, too. She realized she didn't know anything about Chinese 
herbs or Chinese medicine. She slowly started to put the pieces together in terms 
of her exposure to Chinese herbs as a 
kid and wanting to learn more about an 
entire modality and philosophy she had no knowledge of. Because there is a 
lot 
of overlap, she started to make connections between herbs she learned about in a 
western context and how they are also used in Chinese medicine. 
00:09:23 
Gaby's interest in farming started when she was in college. Growing up, she was 
interested in cooking and food, and she cooked a 
lot from a 
young age. She went 
to college in Vermont, but she didn't really know anything about Vermont, or 
about farms. Even though she grew up in California, she was still very much a 
city kid. Despite having some knowledge about farms because of her exposure to 
farmers markets in California, she didn't really consider where or how food was 
actually grown. 
Gaby slowly became interested in farming while attending school in Vermont. She 
had some friends who grew up in more rural areas, and they started telling her 
about how food is actually grown. She also had many opportunities to visit farms 
through her college's connections to Vermont's strong local food system. 
In addition, a 
friend in college introduced Gaby to urban farming. She did her first 
farming internship at City Slicker Farms in West Oakland. That was the first time 
she learned how to start seeds and pick vegetables. It snowballed from there. She 
loved being outside, working with her hands, and seeing things grow from start to 
finish. She was amazed by the process of starting something from seed and 
watching it become food you can eat. She became consumed by that and wanted 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
2 
to continue watching things grow and using her hands and body. Coming out of 
school, Gaby knew she didn't want to do an office job and that she wanted to 
work in the food system. She decided to try a 
full year of farming first, with the 
hope that it would give her perspective into what part of the food system she 
wanted to go into next. 
Somehow, farming stuck. While part of her wanted to do urban city life, she loved 
being outside and all of the different aspects of farming. She did some vegetable 
farming, but also worked with animals before finding her way to flowers and 
herbs. 
00:14:13 
After graduating from college, Gaby worked at Pie Ranch, a 
nonprofit farm in 
Pescadero, California, that focuses on youth education and farmer training. She 
did their nine-month apprenticeship. They grew vegetables for a 
CSA 
(Community Supported Agriculture), had animals (pigs, chickens, goats, cows), 
grew flowers, and did youth education. School groups would come and work in 
the field with them. They also had a 
farmstand and gained exposure to marketing 
and sales that way. It was a 
great experience, because it was a 
little bit of 
everything. She had the chance to try a 
lot of different things, which helped her 
see what area of farming she might want to go into. 
One of her main takeaways is that although youth education is important, she's 
not the one to be educating. She learned so much about farming, and it was great 
to see a 
full season from start to finish. 
00:16:05 
From there, Gaby became a 
personal farmer for a 
family in Los Gatos. She went 
from being an apprentice doing her first year of farming to managing a 
small 
operation herself. They grew vegetables in raised beds and had goats and 
chickens. She processed the dairy into butter and cheese and helped with some of 
the fruit picking on the orchard. 
That was a 
great way for her to start working on her own. She had a 
manager who 
helped out with a 
lot of things, but there was a 
lot of learning on the go, figuring 
things out, Googling, and trial and error. Because it was a 
smaller, private 
operation, she wasn't selling anything, which gave her a 
lot more room to 
experiment and make mistakes. This experience empowered her and allowed her 
to be more comfortable with trial and error. There are so many unknowns in 
everything you do in farming, and you have to have faith that things will work 
out. Even when things don't happen exactly the way you want, you have to go 
from there and adapt. That position was important for Gaby to become 
comfortable with the uncertainty. 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021

00:18:21 
Gaby wasn't planning on looking for that type of role. She was originally 
interested in the position they were offering as a 
weekend goat milker. After Pie 
Ranch, she thought she might want to transition into an office job and stop 
farming for a 
little bit. Although Gaby has always loved farming, she has never 
really been sure about doing it long term. It's not the most secure job to have, and 
you don't make a 
lot of money doing it. 
When trying to figure out her next steps, she was looking for office jobs and 
found the weekend milking position. She thought it would be a 
great opportunity 
to have some farm time while still looking for more of an urban city job. When 
she went to the interview, they presented her with the full-time managerial 
position. It felt like an opportunity she didn't want to turn down, so she took it. 
00:20:17 
After those two years of farming, she left farming to work for an organic produce 
distributor as a 
produce buyer. That was her compromise. She was trying an office 
job in San Francisco, but it was still in the food system supporting and working 
with farmers. It was important for her to continue working with farmers and to 
support small, local agriculture, while also trying out a 
new set of skills in a 
new 
environment. 
This job was a 
great experience, and it helped her with her own farm. She gained 
a 
greater understanding of the bigger logistical aspects of the food system, in 
terms of distribution and the relationships between growers, sellers, and buyers. 
However, office life and commuting didn't serve Gaby well, and after a 
year and a 
half of working in that office, she decided to go back to farming. 
Working at the distributor made Gaby realize how hard it is for vegetable farmers 
to distinguish themselves. Seeing the business side of things, Gaby realized how 
much competition there was. Everyone was growing the same thing, which drops 
the prices. As a 
buyer, it was hard to choose who to buy from, because everything 
was of good quality. 
She knew she didn't want to go back into vegetable farming after seeing the low 
margins. One thing she remembered and held on to from her time at Pie Ranch 
was that flowers have one of the highest profit margins of any crop. They're 
considered more of a 
luxury item, and there's a 
lot of potential for value-added 
products such as bouquets and arrangements. Gaby saw greater potential for it to 
be a 
profitable and viable business. She also wanted to grow something different 
and new. She had a 
lot of experience growing vegetables and working with 
animals, but she knew there was a 
lot to learn with flowers. She has always been 
attracted to the beauty and variety of flowers, and she had been doing some floral 
design on her own. She was able to work at a 
flower farm in the area for two 
seasons.

00:24:35 
The farm Gaby was working at focused on growing flowers for weddings. 
Weddings are a 
big part of the flower industry, because it gives you a 
lot of 
potential for adding value. It's a 
full service, and designing and installing the 
flowers tends to be a 
way for flower farms to make more money. Gaby knew she 
wasn't interested in weddings, so she thought about how to grow flowers for a 
different purpose. She says weddings are a 
one-day event, and all of the work of 
growing and designing the flowers turns into a 
one-day experience for a 
limited 
number of people. 
The other challenging part about growing fresh flowers is that the window for 
harvesting them is very limited. You want to harvest them at just the right time so 
that they will last longer for customers. Once you harvest them, they go straight 
into the cooler, and the window to sell them from there is also very narrow. To 
reduce that stress of having to sell in a 
time-sensitive way, Gaby thought about 
how to incorporate drying flowers and making wreaths into her business model. 
She was also thinking a 
lot about herbs and how they overlapped with flowers. 
She wanted to focus in on that as a 
way to take her skills as a 
flower farmer and 
apply them to growing herbs. 
An opportunity came up for her to farm with some friends in Pescadero where she 
had farmed before. Pie Ranch started an incubator farmer program after coming 
into a 
plot of land. They were trying to create opportunities for new farmers, 
especially people of color and women, to access land and start a 
farm business 
under an incubator program with low overhead (low land rate and access to 
infrastructure and tractors). 
Some of Gaby's friends from 2015 had started farming at this incubator farm 
already, and she had been in conversation with them for a 
while about how they 
could collaborate. The opportunity presented itself to start her own business and 
work with her friends at their already-established vegetable farm, Brisa De Ano 
Ranch. It would be a 
collaboration where she could start her own farm but not be 
doing everything completely on her own. She was excited about the opportunity 
to collaborate, work with other people, and be back in the same area where 
she started farming. 
Once she was clear about her idea and business model for the farm, she wanted to 
make sure she was choosing a 
niche market. She knew that dried flowers were 
becoming increasingly popular, and there would be a 
lot of interest. Gaby also 
spoke to her herbal medicine teacher about how interested people were in buying 
locally and sustainably grown herbs, and she knew that would be a 
good market, 
too. Everything came together with the opportunity for land, to work with her 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
5 
friends and collaborate, and to grow for a 
specific market, leading Gaby to start 
her farm in 2020. 
00:30:42 
Gaby was nervous about the business side of things, because that was the part she 
had the least amount of experience with. In terms of actually farming and growing 
things, she had confidence she could do that. There were a 
few things she lined up 
in order to feel comfortable starting her own farm. The first was the collaboration 
with her friends at Brisa Ranch. Specifically, having their support around doing 
deliveries together was really helpful. It takes a 
lot of time to do deliveries, and in 
the middle of the season, the idea of spending any time away from your farm to 
do deliveries is very stressful. They also generously offered to share customers 
with her and give her access to some of their sales outlets, including their CSA 
(Community Supported Agriculture). 
For a 
winter, Gaby also ended up working for another produce distributor as a 
buyer. Through that established relationship, she knew she could sell through that 
distributor as well. Once she secured a 
few sales outlets and felt confident she 
could sell what she was going to grow, she felt more confident starting the 
business. 
00:33:22 
Gaby describes the process of starting her own farming business. She says it has 
been challenging in many ways. Housing was a 
difficult part of her first year of 
farming. Having a 
farm and being a 
farmer is not just a 
job. Your entire lifestyle 
revolves around the farm. She didn't have farm housing until the beginning or 
middle of the summer (2020). Not having that stability was an ongoing challenge, 
and it affected the farm. 
Setting up infrastructure was also difficult, because Gaby hadn't grown herbs 
before. She felt confident growing them because she decided only to grow herbs 
that are flowers, but harvesting flowers for medicinal use is very different than 
harvesting for cut flowers. For the post-harvest handling of the herbs, she learned 
as she went. She had to build a 
drying wrack for the herbs and learn about the 
intricacies of drying and storing them. She didn't have a 
lot of resources or 
mentors, because there aren't that many people growing Chinese herbs, or even 
herbs in general. Instead, Gaby had to try new things and reference books where 
she could. 
Finding other sales outlets was also a 
challenge. Through the distributor she was 
working with, she had outlets for the cut flowers, but it was an ongoing process 
having to create her own networks of herbalists for selling the herbs. She had a 
few herbalist friends who supported her in the beginning and tried to help get the 
word out about her herbs. Lastly, Gaby found it challenging to manage the 
computer work while also managing the field work. She had never used 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
6 
QuickBooks before, and she had to figure stuff like that out throughout the 
season. 
00:37:22 
Gaby has had a 
lot of support from friends she has worked with. She has been 
lucky to meet many amazing people. Some of the other apprentices at Pie Ranch 
have been huge sources of support for her, including the three people who work at 
Brisa Ranch. They're all incredibly helpful in a 
number of ways. Gaby's friend, 
Kellee Matsushita, is also an Asian American farmer and has a 
lot of flower 
experience. She is one of Gaby's go-to people to ask for help, from harvesting 
new types of flowers to designing bouquets. The owner of the flower farm Gaby 
worked on, Joanna Letz, taught Gaby a 
lot about growing flowers and managing a 
flower business. She also learned a 
lot about growing and using herbs through 
classes with Maya Blow at Soul Flower Farm in El Sobrante. Maya incorporates 
spirituality into the way she farms and works with plants, which was important for 
Gaby to think about putting the land first in everything she does. 
00:40:05 
When Gaby was getting more into farming, she worked with Kellee and knew of 
a 
few other farms with Asian American farmers. It wasn't until about two years 
ago that there became a 
group of Asian American farmers, and there was more 
representation. Gaby was very aware that there weren't very many Asian 
American farmers. It was obvious from the time she started farming that it is very 
white-dominated in terms of land and farm owners. In the last few years, Gaby 
started to feel like there were more Asian American people farming. 
Since then, it's been a 
huge support to have other Asian American farmers. There 
are many challenges when you want to grow Asian crops, including limited access 
to resources. Having a 
network now that wasn't around when she first started 
farming has been really uplifting. Through Kellee, Gaby met Scott Chang-
Fleeman, owner of Shao Shan Farm in Bolinas, and they started partnering 
together on a 
few things. Gaby put in some perennial herbs at his farm, including 
goji berries and chrysanthemum flowers for tea. It's important for them to be able 
to support each other, work together, and collaborate. Scott is growing vegetables 
but was interested in having herbs on his farm, and Gaby wanted to grow 
perennials but didn't have long-term land security where she's growing. Scott 
offered to let Gaby put in some plants that she knew could stay there long-term. 
Having those relationships now is super helpful and important. 
00:43:15 
Having people who knew about plants and varieties other than the typical western 
varieties was critical for Gaby. It opened up the possibility of growing Chinese 
vegetables, which wasn't something she had seen before. In anything you do, 
knowing that you have the support of like-minded people you really care about 
goes a 
long way in knowing that someone has your back. Being able to call a 
friend to ask for help when she is overloaded during harvest time is a 
huge thing. 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
7 
Knowing that she's not alone and that people will help her when she needs it has 
been really important. 
00:44:58 
Gaby says there are a 
lot of different priorities when deciding what to grow on her 
farm. For the cut flowers, she considers what can grow on the land, in addition to 
the climate and needs of the soil. There's also the financial and economic side of 
things, in terms of thinking about what will actually make her money and what 
will keep her business afloat. Gaby has always been realistic about the financial 
sustainability of an operation. There's no point in starting a 
farm if you're going 
to be losing money the whole time. You're not doing a 
service to yourself, to the 
land, or to your customers. 
Gaby has always thought long-term about financial stability, which is where the 
cut flowers come into play. They offer a 
higher profit margin, and relatively 
speaking, they're easier to harvest and sell because she has a 
secure sales outlet. 
That has been the most stable money maker for her. Dahlias are one of Gaby's 
favorite flowers, because there's a 
lot of variety in their form, shape, and color. 
She grew a 
lot of the dried flowers knowing that she would be making wreaths 
and dried arrangements. With dried flowers, she really likes textural elements, so 
she thinks about the colors and textures that she likes and that go well together. 
In terms of the medicinal herbs, she focused on flowers that are herbs with 
medicinal properties. Lately, she has been thinking a 
lot about her community's 
health needs. Even before the pandemic, she was thinking a 
lot about our lungs, 
specifically in the context of wildfire season in California. With long periods of 
wildfire smoke in the state, Gaby thought about having herbs that support lung 
health and strength. She also thought about tea. Without any herbalist training 
herself, she knew she wasn't going to make medicine products that she would sell 
to people. She also knew that in addition to selling to herbalists, she wanted to sell 
to the general public. Because she felt that the easiest entryway into medicinal 
herbs is through tea, Gaby wanted herbs that were tasty for tea and could be used 
on their own without any processing. 
Thinking about a 
tea that was suitable for the land and familiar to customers, she 
decided on chrysanthemum. Gaby grew up drinking chrysanthemum tea, and she 
loved it. There are a 
lot of questionable growing practices with Chinese herbs, 
especially those that come from China, so it was important for her to grow fresh, 
local, sustainably grown Chinese herbs. Finding what would grow well and what 
people would want to drink as tea were her main considerations for choosing 
herbs. 
00:51:09 
Acquiring the knowledge to grow these plants is one of the most challenging 
parts of growing Chinese herbs. There are very few people doing it domestically, 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
8 
and from Gaby's experience, the knowledge is very consolidated among mostly 
white people. 
One thing Gaby didn't know about medicinal herbs before, and has mostly 
encountered with Chinese herbs, is that the germplasm needs to be very specific if 
you're using them medicinally. You can't just grow any chrysanthemum. It has to 
be derived from an original source of chrysanthemum that has been identified as a 
medicinal plant. 
Gaby didn't know that the germplasm was so important. When she first started 
seeking out some of these plants, there were very few places to get them, and the 
plants were extremely expensive. One chrysanthemum plant costs about fifteen 
dollars if you order it online, and she has two hundred plants right now. 
There is a 
Chinese medicine network forming, and they're trying to encourage 
growers to produce more Chinese medicinal herbs organically and sustainably in 
the U.S. Gaby was connected with someone in that group who offered her a 
work 
exchange in return for access to some of the plants. For the chrysanthemum in 
particular, you divide the roots or take cuttings. They don't come from seeds, so 
you need to find someone who has the plant and replicate it off the original. She 
was lucky to get access to those plants. Otherwise, she would have to spend 
thousands of dollars getting them. 
Figuring out where to access these plants has been an ongoing, uphill battle. It's a 
balance, because there are some places that will only buy your herbs if they have 
the original germplasm. In order for her to get that, she needs to buy extremely 
expensive seeds. She doesn't want to get trapped in that system of having to rely 
on seed companies to get those plants. People are trying to spread the knowledge, 
but she's very aware of the fact that it's a 
self-selecting group, and that in order to 
have access, it's still very expensive. 
00:55:13 
Gabby wants to sell to other Asian American herbalists, because there are few 
people working with herbs who are Asian American. She didn't have any 
knowledge of the field of acupuncture and Chinese medicine herbalists before 
starting the farm, and she quickly learned that very few acupuncturists in America 
are Asian American or of Asian descent. While looking for acupuncturists in the 
Bay Area through social media, she discovered that most of them were white. 
With the uprisings around George Floyd's death and the ongoing anti-Asian 
sentiment around COVID, Gaby found that the overt racism in the field of 
acupuncture was becoming increasingly contentious. For example, there was a 
petition to remove the word "oriental" from a 
lot of acupuncture schools. Gaby 
couldn't believe that it hadn't been done sooner. It has been interesting for her to 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
9 
get into. She is an Asian American growing herbs, but the field of people she 
wants to sell to are predominantly white. Seeking out other Asian Americans who 
work with herbs from an herbalist/acupuncturist perspective has been really 
important for Gaby. 
00:57:34 
Last year, Gaby ended up doing a 
lot of public pop-ups to sell the dried flowers, 
some fresh cut flowers, and herbs for tea. She primarily did marketing through 
Instagram, so that was how people were finding her. It was great to be able to 
connect with people that way and have some face-to-face interaction with her 
customers. In addition to selling tea packs that were packed for individual use, she 
also offered herbs in bulk. 
00:58:23 
Gaby has gotten to connect with a 
lot of Asian American people through her farm 
and products. She has received many messages from other Asian Americans who 
want to connect more with herbs and are looking for products like hers. It has 
been very validating and reaffirming for her to be able to provide a 
connection for 
others who want to work with herbs and have their own childhood memories of 
chrysanthemum tea. There are many people out there wanting that connection to 
their ancestral plants. That's one of Gaby's main reasons for wanting to continue 
growing Chinese herbs. She has a 
lot of younger customers around her age, and 
they are starting to discover dried flowers. For older generations, dried flowers 
became antiquated, tacky, and cheesy, but the younger generations are 
rediscovering them. 
1:00:13 
While there haven't been any particularly memorable interactions with customers, 
Gaby mentions the general sentiment of connection to memory around these herbs 
and the interest in wanting to learn more. She gets a 
lot of messages from people 
wanting to learn more from her about Chinese herbs. However, Gaby notes that 
she is also still learning and would like to learn more with her customers. It's 
exciting for her to know that there are other people who are interested. She has 
one customer who is a 
doula and is starting a 
collective around Asian American 
birth workers and doulas to provide resources for Asian mothers through their 
pregnancies and births. This is another example of how much herbs can support 
us through important life moments and transitions. Gaby has been learning more 
about how herbs can be used for infants and babies. 
1:02:05 
Gaby loves drinking the tea that she grows. It's incredible to be able to use 
something that she grows, even when it was vegetables. It feels nourishing to 
know that you know where the plants came from, and you feel one hundred 
percent confident in their quality. The first time she drank her chrysanthemum tea, 
she says she had never had such fresh tea before. There are many medicinal 
benefits of chrysanthemum, including for the eyes and detoxification of the liver. 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
10 
Most days, she ends the day with a 
cup of tea. It feels incredible to drink tea made 
from flowers that she grew. 
When Gaby is going through the motions of farming, she thinks a 
lot about all of 
the people who did it before her. As she's doing the motions, she can feel the other 
people for generations who also did those motions. The first few times Gaby 
harvested chrysanthemum, she could feel that people for generations before her 
had been picking it. Knowing that it was the same actions and that she could 
continue bringing that into the world was really significant for her. 
1:04:16 
Gaby thinks her parents were very confused for a 
long time about her decision to 
farm. It's not necessarily something that they identify with or fully understand. 
They both grew up in the city, and neither of them had relationships to farming or 
agriculture before. On her mom's side, Gaby's great-great-grandfather was a 
salt 
farmer, but there wasn't as much agriculture in more recent generations. 
Despite their confusion about her decision, they're proud of how she has taken 
farming into her own hands and built something for herself. They're excited about 
Gaby growing Chinese herbs, because it gives them something else in common. 
She can talk to them about herbs that she's thinking of growing, and they have 
their own ideas and knowledge about what the herbs do. For Gaby, so much of 
what is cool about medicinal herbs and herbalism is that it's medicine and 
knowledge that has been passed down for generations, often through oral 
traditions. 
There are a 
lot of folk stories around herbs, and Gaby enjoys being able to share 
that with her family. She can do online research about the herbs, but then her 
parents have their own version of how the herbs are used based on their 
experiences growing up. It's been cool to talk to them about it, but also to grow 
some of the herbs she grew up around, like goji berries. Growing up, they had 
broth soup after dinner, and she remembers squishing the seeds out of the goji 
berries in the soup. Being able to grow her own goji berries and share them with 
her parents is very significant. 
1:06:49 
Gaby's parents like the chrysanthemum tea. She recalls getting text messages 
from her mom about how her dad requested her tea when his throat was feeling 
scratchy. When she was growing vegetables, there were a 
lot of vegetables she 
would bring to her parents that they weren't very interested in. They didn't really 
want to eat kale or butternut squash, so it's cool to bring them things she knows 
they actually want. 
1:07:50 
All of Gaby's experiences have contributed in different ways. Leading up to 
starting her farm, she was dabbling in a 
lot of different things. At the end of every 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
11 
season of farming, she wasn't sure if she wanted to keep going. Even though she 
thought about what she might want to do on her own farm, she wasn't building 
towards starting her own farm. When the opportunity did come for her to start the 
farm, she felt grateful that almost subconsciously, all of her experiences were able 
to meld together to support her in taking the next step toward her own farm. 
Learning about the different types of farming (animals, vegetables, flowers) 
and working in an office all gave Gaby important knowledge and exposure. There 
wasn't necessarily one particular moment that led to her starting her own farm, 
but it was trusting that she was doing things that would eventually lead to her 
farm without knowing it. Part of what's so difficult about being on your own and 
starting your own farm and business is believing in yourself and trusting that you 
do know how to do it even though there are so many unknowns.

Gaby thought about her Asian American identity in farming from the beginning. 
Her parents encouraged her to think about growing Asian crops for the large 
population of Asian Americans in the San Francisco area. Because of this, she 
understood pretty early on that there was a 
huge demographic of people in that 
area willing to spend money on high-quality, organic, locally produced produce 
that isn't currently being grown. Since Gaby wasn't thinking about starting her 
own farm at the time, she didn't take the suggestion into serious consideration. 
Later, seeing how much competition there was for standard vegetables and 
knowing that she didn't want to participate in that moved Gaby in a 
different 
direction. 
The last year of working with mostly white people growing Chinese herbs has 
definitely made Gaby realize how important it is for there to be more 
representation of Asian American farmers, especially ones growing Asian crops. 
There needs to be more Asian American farmers growing those herbs. It's not just 
about the plants and herbs themselves, but about the people and the connection to 
those plants. That's an important part of why Gaby is growing the herbs, and she 
doesn't think they can be separate. It was a 
valuable lesson for her to learn last 
year as she was working with these people and wanting to move ahead the agenda 
of getting more herbs grown domestically. Last year was a 
big push for her to 
identify more strongly as an Asian American grower and to recognize the 
importance of having other Asian American farmers. 
1:15:27 
Gaby says that being an Asian American farmer puts her at a 
disadvantage in 
some ways. First, she is a 
first-generation farmer, so she has no familial support 
around farming. There are other people whose families settled on land, have been 
farming for generations, and can offer support and training. Gaby's parents 
immigrated to the U.S., and she doesn't have a 
history of farming or any 
equipment and infrastructure that was handed down to her. For any first-

12 
generation farmer, it's challenging to go up against people who have been farming 
forever. Being children of immigrants and not having any of that generational 
knowledge and wealth handed down is also difficult. Lastly, entering into any 
field that is so white-dominated is intimidating, and the support is not there in the 
same way that it exists for other farmers. 
1:17:03 
One of the biggest takeaways from Gaby's first year on her own farm was 
learning to let things go. At the beginning of the season, she was so focused on 
perfectionism and wanting to get the most out of every crop, she pushed herself 
really hard to harvest everything in order to maximize what she was getting out of 
the field. It was stressing her out more than anything else. Instead of harvesting 
and selling flowers that she could've moved right away, she spent time picking 
things and drying certain herbs that she wasn't selling. It took her a 
long time to 
realize that she needed to let go of the flowers that required a 
lot of time and 
weren't making her any money. She tried to focus on what she could get done in 
the moment and accept that she didn't need to maximize everything she was 
doing. Looking back, she says it was a 
very capitalist mindset. It was a 
big en-
training process for her at the beginning of the season, but it ended up paying off 
a 
lot by the end of the season. She was able to prioritize and focus a 
lot more. 
A 
wildfire hit Gaby's farm last August, which completely altered where she was 
going and what she was doing. She was really happy that she had already come to 
the realization of letting things go before the fire. Once it hit, there were many 
things out of her control, and she had no idea what to do. 
1:20:07 
Going forward, Gaby wants to be more organized with record keeping and 
tracking what she's doing. She tried to start doing that her first year, but after the 
fire, all of the record keeping and organizational stuff went out the window. That's 
a 
big focus for her in the upcoming season. This winter, she's trying to get ahead 
of it and have more things set up ahead of the growing season. 
She also wants to grow more herbs in 2021, but it's a 
hard balance. The herbs are 
more time consuming for Gaby to grow and harvest, especially when she's drying 
them, and the price points are not nearly as high as they are for cut flowers. It's 
hard to balance wanting to grow more herbs with wanting to make sure she's 
economically viable. That's one area she's trying to tweak and work on this 
season. 
1:22:07 
On a 
broader scale across the food system, Gaby would like to see more farmers. 
She especially wants to see smaller farmers that are growing more diverse crops, 
including Asian crops, localizing in on their communities, and providing food to 
meet community needs. It's important for us to be supporting small farmers and 
taking away from the industrial food system. Growing food that is relevant to 
Gabrielle Lee Interview Log, January 18, 2021 
13 
people's cultures is also really important. There's a 
huge demand for it, and Gaby 
thinks it would be really beneficial to the food system. 
1:22:37 
Gaby advises other BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of color) who are trying to 
get into farming to find mentors that you want to learn from. Narrow in on what 
exactly you want to learn and grow. Because there are many different farms and 
things you can grow, it's helpful to find a 
speciality. The industrial food system 
has a 
pretty strong hold on growing mass-produced food, but what we really need 
is for people to grow more "specialty" things (foods that feel specialty to the 
widespread mass audience, but are very mainstream in certain cultural 
households). 
Learning from other farmers and mentors is very beneficial, but there are a 
lot of 
people out there who have different styles of growing. Finding the right person for 
you is important. It's okay to take the time to learn. Gaby says she jumped into 
her farm very quickly because the opportunity came up, but there's still a 
lot she 
wishes she had learned beforehand. Now, she's learning it as she goes, and she's 
finding mentors who can help and support her. Having that support is really 
important.
