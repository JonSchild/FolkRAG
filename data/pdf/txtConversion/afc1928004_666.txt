SLIPPERY CROCODILE. 
Sung by MooaE & DALY in all the principal Theatres in America 
with great success. 
0: -
Standing on the banks of the Mississippi, 
Listening to the water flow along; 
happy as a 
worm in a 
barrel of mud, 
Little nigger knows no wrong. 
Steam-boat whistle heard along the shore, 
Pretty soon you hear the water boil; 
Pretty soon you hear an awful noise, 
Coming from the Slippery Crocodile, 
You ought to see the mouth of the animal, 
When he opens his mouth and shuts his eyes; 
lie is fond of niggers both lean and fat, 
And also cross-eyed flies. 
Massa, Jonah lived inside a 
whale. 
Massa, you can bet your bottom pile, 
He couldn't live a 
minute and a 
half 
inside of the Slippery Crocodile,

THE STAGE-STRUCK FAMILY. 
JOHANNA McINTOSH. 
Written and sung with great success by BILLY moonE, of 
moonE & DALY, Parody Singers. 
I've raised a 
family, there's just thirteen, 
From the eldest one, Dan, to the youngest just weaned: 
I've tried all my life to keep them at home, 
But you know that it's some children's nature to roam. 
There's the eldest one, Margaret, who is not yet of age. 
Ilan away from her home, and went on the stage ; 
But I 
can't blame her much, ' twas her nature you see, 
And, besides, every week she sends money to me. 
CHORUS: 
I 
went last week to see her a 
dancing, 
I 
tell you, my bucko's, it was great fun; 
She came out on the stage with the music a 
prancing, 
And this is the kind of a 
dance that she done. 
(Dances a 
Fling), 
There's my son, Pat, he could never get fat, 
He'd dance on the corner from morning till night; 
He'd sing and he'd shout, and he'd wear his shoes out, 
And come home in the morning generally tight. 
Now, he has joined Haverly's big forty stars, 
He started away with them off on the cars; 
He wears a 
large diamond as big as my hat, 
I'm proud of my son, for an actor is Pat. 
Cnonus: 
When last he played here, I 
got chuck full of beer, 
And took all the family up to see the fun; 
The band gave a 
scream, and out came sixteen, 
And this is the kind of a 
dance that they done. 
(Dances a 
Clog).

There is a 
charming girl in Ham-Fat Lane, 
She thinks the world of me; 
And every night when I 
get tight, 
To her I 
go to see. 
She's a 
face like a 
pig's head soaked in a 
barrel, 
And a 
nose like a 
yellow squash; 
She's as pretty as a 
pollywog kicked by a 
mule, 
Is Theresa Jane Johanna McIntosh. 
CHORUS: 
She has a 
brother in the gas house sifting smoke,—Sym. 
And a 
cousin in jail for robbing a 
bloke ;—Sym. 
On a 
foggy night when the moon shines bright, 
And the streets are all mud and slush; 
She flirts with all the horse-car men, 
Does Theresa Jane Johanna McIntosh. 
I 
met her out the other night, 
While walking down the street; 
She said she put her shoes in pawn, 
She was in her stocking-feet. 
She said her Pa would make a 
kick, 
If he caught her on the mash; 
She's a 
bank-robber's daughter in disguise, 
Is Theresa Jane Johanna McIntosh. 
MY OWN TOM CAT. 
Composed and sung by GEo. W. CALLAHAN, the Ventriloquist. 
Bad luck to Bergh and the city fathers, 
And the blagguards that made up that law ; 
You can't find his equa! from here to Chicago, 
And from there, me boys, to Arkansaw. 
I 
had a 
cat, he was a 
darling, 
his color was gray, he was two feet long; 
I'd give two dollars if I 
could collar 
The blagguard that went and stole me Tom. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, he was a 
darling, he sung so charming 
In our back yard the whole night long; 
I'd lay down me supper to catch that sucker 
That went and stole away me Tom. 
He bate the cat of McNally's, 
He was the champion of our back yard; 
He ran again Mrs. Duffy 
In Fagan's ally and gave her a 
very bad fall; 
He was thrown from a 
roof ten times over, 
- He was poisoned twice, now that was wrong; 
The cat- catchers caught him, away they brought hita., 
I 
am lonely since I 
lost me Torn. 
CHORUS: 
Oh I 
am lonely, so very lonely, 
That poor old cat to the beautiful shore has gone; 
He's drinking lager along with Talmadge, 
I 
am lonesome for my old Tom cat,

Send Me A 
Rose From My Angel 
Mother's Grave. 
Music for sale and Copyrighted by B. 
W. 
HITCHCOCK, 166 Nassau 
Street, N. Y. Sung by BILLY BIRCH, Esq. 
I've been thinking to-day of the happy years ago, 
And the tears quickly gathered in my eyes; 
As I 
held within my hand a 
portrait and a 
flower, 
Tokens bound to me by many sacred ties. 
The picture is my mothers, and she sent it cross the 
sea, 
And a 
blessing to her wandering son she gave; 
And this little faded flower blossomed on the grassy 
mound, 
For they sent me a 
rose from mother's grave. 
When you kneel down in prayer near the spot where 
she's laid, 
Remember this favor that I 
crave; 
Oh! take from the holy ground a 
blossom from the 
mound, 
And send me a 
rose from mothers grave. 
I 
would give all this world if it were mine to give, 
If my mother could return to me again; 
I 
would strive then to repay her many acts of love, 
For my heart is calling, and it calls in vain. 
Never more to feel her kisses and her words of bright-
est cheer; 
When she bid me hope, be patient, true and brave, 
And I 
keep my little flower ever near where e'er I 
go, 
For it blossomed on my angel mother's grave.

THE TAIL OF MY COAT. 
As sung with thunders of applause everywhere, by M ILES M ORRIS. 
the popular Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
I LEARNED my reading and writing at Ballynaggerti 
when I 
went to school, 
It was there I 
first took to fightin' wid the schoolmaster, 
Mr. O'Toole, 
He and I 
we had many a 
scrimmage, but the dive] a 
copy 
I 
wrote, 
For there wasn't a 
gossoon in the village could stand on the 
tail of my coat. 
CHORUS. 
Dare stand on the tail of my coat, ah! just tread on the 
tail of`my coat, 
If you're in for a 
row or a 
ruction, just stand on the tail of 
my coat. 
I 
was an illegant hand, too, at courtin', for lessons I 
took 
'in the art, 
Till cupid, the blackguard, while sporting clhrew an arrow 
straight through my heart, 
Judy Connor, I 
lived straight forninst her and tender lines 
to her I 
wrote, 
but the divil a 
boy in the village could stand on the tail of 
my coat. 
Dare stand, &c. 
But a 
big trotter, Mickey Malony , tried for to steal her away. 
He had money and I 
hadn't any, so a 
challenge I 
sent him 
next day, 
Next morning we met at Killalley, and the Shannon we 
crossed in a 
boat, 
Oh, I 
lathered him with my shillalah, for he stood on the 
tail of my coat. 
Dare stand, .ke. 
Now my fame is spread over the counthry, folks flocked to 
gaze upon me, 
They all cried out without hesitation your a 
fighting man, 
Mickey Magee, 
t 
fought with the Finigan faction, and I 
hate all the Mur-
phys afloat, 
So if your in for a 
belly-go4isther, just stand on the tail ofl 
my coat. 
Dare stand, &c. 
I've traveled through 'Ulster and Munster, Kilkenny, and 
Connaught likewise, 
It was there when I 
first was a 
youngster, I 
opened this 
pair of brown eyes; 
It's there you'll arse fire without smoke; for a 
shilling 
you'll buy 50 eggs, 
ii.nd the girls they can all take a 
joke there, and there kt. 
monkeys without any legs.

The Tramp's Lament. 
Sung in character by Alvt.EsAloitizis at Tony -Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
On dusty road, mid city strife, 
No matter where we travel, 
The world's against the poor old tramp. 
He's everywhere a 
rebel. 
The farmer's wife denies him food, 
His very look speaks danger, 
Take pity on the poor old tramp, 
An outcast and a 
stranger. 
CHORUS. 
The house dog's barking at my heels, 
The watchman springs his rattle ; 
The lockup is my bed and board, 
I 
sleep on straw like cattle. 
My hat is old, my shoes well worn, 
My toes all laughing through them ; 
My pant-legs crawling to my knees, 
No patches can renew them. 
My threadbare coat with buttons gone, 
Its tail has followed after ; 
Misfortune claims me as its own, 
I 
hear but jeers and laughter. 
The house dog's barking, & c. 
TRAMP'S LAMENT. 
Continued. 
Once I 
was young, and plenty filled 
The old red barn and byre; 
My mother's loving face I 
see, 
My brother, sister, sire. 
My father's manly form was bent, 
When years ago we parted, 
My wife and children all are gone, 
Behold me broken-hearted. 
The house dog's barking, &c. 
A burden on the town I've been, 
When years ago I 
counted 
My lands and houses by the score, 
With love and cheer surrounded. 
Misfortune came, no hand to help, 
I 
beg, I 
cannot borrow, 
The poor-house soon will be my lot, 
I 
care not for the morrow. 
The house dog's barking, &c. 
Kind friends, within your happy homes 
Where want ne'er casts a 
shadow, 
Take pity on the friendless tramp. 
Deal gently with his sorrow ; 
Deny him not a 
crust of bread, 
That saving cup of water, 
Nor lose reward in store for those 
Who hope for joy hereafter.

You'll Never Run the Engine Unless 
You have the Steam. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, with :great success, throughout the ) I.aited 
States. 
There's many maxims in this world, 
And practice makes them true ; 
But the one that I've invented, 
You'll find it good and new ; 
Man may be likened to a 
boat, 
Afloat on life's great stream, 
But he'll never run the engine 
Unless he has the steam. 
CHORUS. 
Then keep the fires a 
burning, boys, 
You'll find the wheel will turn, 
You'll seldom meet with accidents 
If the motive power you learn. 
Upon life's steam gauge keep an eye, 
Don't fall asleep and drearn, 
For you'll never run the engine 
Unless you keep up steam. 
Look at the home where rich sunshine 
Makes every thing so bright, 
Then gaze upon that poor man's hut, 
Where all is dark at night. 
15 
VOU'LL NEVER RUN THE ENGINE UNLESS YOU 
HAVE THE STEAM . 
Continued. 
His wife lies dying on the straw, 
For bread his children scream, 
'Tis hard to run life's engine far, 
If he hasn't got much steam. 
Then keep the tires, &c. 
Columbus many years ago, 
Did ask the Queen of Spain, 
To fit him out with men and ships, 
To sail the unknown main; 
Some instinct told him there was land 
That never had been seen ; 
Now we run America, for 
Columbus gave us steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c. 
Then haughty England made a 
yoke, 
And brought it to this land. 
But soon found out ' twould never tit 
ThNt brave and fearless band. 
For the engine was commanded 
By Washington and Greene, 
And we owe our independence to 
Their patriotic steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c.

Massa's in the Cold Ground. 
Sung with great success by Barlow, Wilson, Primrose & West's Minstrels. 
Round de meadows am a 
ringing 
The darkies' mournful song, 
While the mocking-bird is singing, 
Happy as the day is long. 
Where the ivy is a 
creeping 
O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
When the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the days were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old massa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
D.M1711 in the corn -field, & I, 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for he leave them behind.

O'REILLY vs. MoDERMOTT, 
Written 1w -PATRICK NEESON for SAM RICKEY. and originally recited 
by EDWARD HALEY, of' The 2 
ITALEys. 
Not one hundred yards from where I 
stand, 
In this, our glorious Union land, 
Was kept a 
first-class whisky stand 
By a 
man, and his name was O'Connor. 
A man that's known both near and far, 
Attends to Mike O'Connor's bar, 
Ile, in our late war, received no sear, 
And his name is O'Reilly. 
Beneath our starry banners wave, 
There was not a 
man fought half so brave, 
Or more greenbacks for whisky gave, 
Than McDermott. 
O'Connor's gin-mill blazed with light, 
On that eventful and bloody night, 
When McDermott had the fearful fight 
With O'Reilly. 
With frowning brow and flashing eye, 
O'Reillytrank a 
glass of rye, 
Which he demolished without a 
si!rh; 
Then turning to McDermott, he said, 
You alcoholic vat! 
you drunken loon! 
You've no more brains than a 
wee gossoon; 
Begorra, I'll make you change your tune, 
Says McDermott. 
With sleeves rolled up, O'Reilly stood 
And swore he'd die, before he would 
Take ba.k a 
single word that could 
In any manner be construed 
Into an apology to McDermott. 
McDermott went for O'Reilly's nose, 
And on it planted fearful blows, 
Till on his eye a 
shanty arose, 
Erected by McDermott. 
O'Reilly fell into a 
swoon, 
And his head rested ol a 
big spittoon: 
Then he dreamt of Barnpm's big Balloon, 
While McDermott quietly put on his 
Coat, and went home about his busim ss. 
O'
Reilley's Billy Goat. 
A RECITATION. 
Written by SHEEHAN and .111cGLoNE. 
Respectfull 
IO JOHN REILLY. 
O'Reilley owned a 
billy goat 
And a 
great buck goat was he, 
He would buck almost any thing 
That he'd happen for to see. 
And if at night he'd roam the streets 
And a 
drunken man he'd meet, 
He'd buck him till he was sick and tired, 
ti nd then his clothes he'd eat 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
He knew every policeman on the beat, 
And he knew if him they found 
That he'd spend. a 
short vacation 
Down here Li the c:ty pound. 
He ate Mrs. Mulligan' underclothes 
That was hangini.T, on the line, 
Shure he bucked a 
Dutchman in the belly, 
And knocked him out of time= 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
But every goat must have his day, 
And this goat's day did come— 
He met a 
butcher's dog one day, 
And the dog for him did run. 
He chased the goat through the streets, 
Shure the dog for him was too smart, 
He chased him till he lost his wind 
And he died of a 
broken heart— 
O'Reilley's billy goat. 
Now, down here in a 
vacant lot 
In a 
corner quite alone, 
There we buried O'Reilley's goat, 
Anti over him raised a 
stone ; 
And perchance you'd pass that way, 
You'll find those words on it are wrote : 
Sacred to the memory of 
O'Reilley's great buck goat.

OH, WHERE IS THAT JONES? 
As sung by HARRY BRAHAM. 
If I 
seem somewhat excited, 
Well, I 
trust I'll be excused, sir, 
My faith and hospitality's 
Been shamefully abused, sir; 
My Angeline—my only child— 
Of whom I 
fondly hoped, 
Has driven her father frantic, wild 
The baggage—she's eloped. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, where's that Jones? 
If I 
catch that Jones, 
Pm sure there will be slaughter; 
Take all I've got— Pd not care a 
jot, 
But don't take an old man's daughter. 
Fool that I 
was! I 
let my child, 
The coxcomb introduce, sir, 
And from that fatal moment, 
He has played the very deuce, sir. 
He'd what those chits of girls would call, 
A 
fascinating manner; 
He'd sing namby-pamby love songs. 
While my child played the " pianer." 
Oh, where's that Jones, etc. 
My girl got so affected, and 
So sad and queer her tones, sir, 
If but a 
day elapsed without 
Her seeing her dear Jones, sir. 
He'd come to dinner, stay to tea, 
Play chess till late at night; 
That she should leave her dad for Jones, 
You'll own was hardly right. 
Oh, where's that Jones, etc. 
Yesterday morn I 
waited, 
Towreceive her morning kiss, sir, 
She did not come as usual, 
Something I 
feared amiss, sir. 
Before me laid a 
little note, 
Which froze my poor old bones— 
She hoped I 
would forgive her, 
For she'd run away with Jones! 
Oh, where's that Jones, etc.

OVER HILLS AND -IYEOUNTAINS. 
•• End Song." Sung by GEORGE POWERS. 
Oh, I 
came from New Hampshire, 
Across the Green Mountains; 
Where the sheep and the shepherds 
And the nanny goats dwell; 
I 
came here in search of 
A 
lovely young damsel; 
Where she has gone to 
I 
really can't tell. 
CHORUS: 
Yet I 
weep and I 
wander, 
O'er hills and o'er mountains, 
For the loss of my true love, 
Oh, where can she be? • 
Her parents they both 
Were highly respectable, 
Her mother milked cows 
On a 
three-legged stool; 
her father's a 
faimer, 
That grows the green turnip-tops, 
Her sister's a 
dairy-maid, 
Her brother's a 
fool. 
She's a 
beautiful, young creature, 
Yes, fair in every feature; 
Her hair is magenta, 
And she squints with one eye; 
She moves when she's walking, 
She speaks when she's talking; 
And if I 
don't find her soon, 
I'll lay down and die. 
(Chorus).

PAT WON'T GO HOME TILL MORNING. 
Composed and sung by J. II. RYAN, now performing with Merchant's 
Panorama of Ireland, as " Rory the Rover." 
THE dawn upon the hill was breaking, the stars were twinkling 
in the sky, 
As Pat upon the ground lay dreaming, his big shiiielah lay close 
by, 
All night the whiskey he's been drinking, and now he wakens 
front his drunken snore, 
116 calls for drink to make him frisky, and swears because there 
is no more. 
CHORUS. 
Then fill up the bowl, hurrah ! for a 
thirsty soul, ha! ha! 
Aft night (mut spree, my boys, my throat with fire is burning. 
Dance so blithe and gay.,hurrah ! none like Pat can be, ha! ha! 
Divil a 
hair I 
care, my boys, we won't go home till morning. 
The moon upon the bogs was gleaming, and the lambs were 
bleating in the shed, 
The pigs and sows the swill are raking, and the gossons waiting 
to be fed, 
Pat home from the wake is trudging slowly, with divil a 
farth-
ing in his purse, 
Besides his pockets are both holey, and credit to poor Pat not 
worth a 
curse. 
Then fill up, &C. 
rile night and fun again advances, and the song and (lanai 
again goes 'round, 
Mid Pat again is nimbly drinking, until with whiskey he gets 
drowned, 
All night he's been swigging at the bottle, and now he tumbles 
flat upon the floor. 
Yet still the boys and girls are dancing, but Pat's asleep t4 
dance no more. 
Then fill up, &c.

We'll all get Jolly as the Night Wears on. 
I 
don't like a 
fellow who's stingy and close, 
And can't bear to part with a 
crown, 
Nor yet do I 
like him who's stern and morose, 
And looks on the world with a 
frown ; 
But give me the fellow whoe'er he may be, 
Who cares not for peasant or king, 
Who likes a 
good spree, that's the fellow for me, 
And with him I'll merrily sing— 
CHORUS. 
Drink, boys, drink, and let your glasses jingle, 
Drink, boys, drink, and bid dull care be gone, 
Shout, boys, shout, and let your voices mingle, 
We'll all get jolly as the night wears on. 
'Tis fine of an evening when business is done, 
And the toils of the day have gone past, 
To sit in the parlor of some cosy pub. 
And drown all your cares in a 
glass; 
Let squeamish teetelers drink coffee and tea, 
And prate of the coppers they save, 
I 
laugh at their cant, and tho' they may rant, 
I'll sing till I'm laid in my grave— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c. 
Of friends I've a 
few, such a 
rollicking crew, 
And trouble assails us in vain, 
We meet every night and often get tight, 
On brandy or glorious champagne ; 
For frolic and noise faith we are the boys, 
And then as the hours speed along, 
We call in the host, who gives us a 
toast, 
Or sings us this right jovial song— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c. 
To fall deep in love with a sweet turtle dove, 
Very fine for some fellows may be, 
But the exquisite bliss of a 
woman's sweet kiss, 
Has no great attraction for me ; 
At young Cupid's shrine to kneel I 
decline, 
To Bacchus I'll stick hard and fast, 
With a 
dollar to spend and another to lend, 
And gaily I'll sing to the last— 
Drink, boys, drink, &c.

You must meet me with your smiling face so bright.

Danny Takes After His Father, 
W'ritten by CHAS. SANDERS. Sung by GRAHAH & JONES with great success. 
Sweet was the girl I 
met last Sunday 
While walking through the park to take the evening air, 
She smiled when I 
passed her, 
My heart went with her, 
I 
knew titqt I 
had won 
This little Deitcher girl so fair, 
Oh, she sent me a 
note 
On which was wrote— 
Her name was Beekey Gildersleeve, 
Her fader he was rich, 
Tier mutter keeps a 
bier serloon 
Behind McCoomb's Ditch, 
I 
am going to meet this German girl 
Next Sunday afternoon, 
I'll treat her to a 
dozen bier's, 
And catch her very soon. 
I'll put on me Sunday clothes 
And won't I 
look gallus, 
With my swallow- tail coat, 
Double-breasted in the back, 
I'll pay five cents on the steam locomotive 
And to her house I'll ride on the railroad 
I 
expect there will be a 
band, 
At the depot when I 
land. 
To escort me to my Beckey's house, 
Und then her folks will see, 
Or else a 
half a 
dozen clubs 
Be waiting there for me. 
And if I 
don't get her consent, 
I 
know I 
turn a 
loon, 
And cut my throat with it bar of soap; 
That will end me very soon.

SO 
DAN DORKINS." 
[Burlesque Poem.] 
As delivered by PAT ROONEY, the peoples' favorite, with rounds of 
applause. 
The theatre was full, and so was the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack wire clog, 
For he was the pompey round here. 
The bar-room was perfectly crowded with beats, 
Who waited a 
pleasant surprise; 
tmt 
For they knew the would eat when the lunch was set 
v 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose and so did the people, 
Who commenced for to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
And they gave him the laugh and " Yah, yah 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure; 
"He's away off his base," says old Joe Jewell, 
Who never went back on the poor. 
A 
brick! yes, it was! I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark-red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
And continually dropping his cue. 
He says: " I'm a 
king!" when a 
woman jumped up 
And says: " You lie, you are one of the gang!" 
It knocked Dorkins cold, he owed her for washing, 
And his head on his breast he did hang. 
At length to the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And 
Ladies and gentlemen, said, 
" 
If I 
have not drank enough Bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When O'Leary and I 
walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish ould ' Sam Sandford' was here. 
You insult me to-night, and say I 
am sober, 
Let Tony Pastor play Hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know you won't laugh, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead drunk at home,"

As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGIIES. 
In Harlem it was once my fate to see four little boys, 
Who, trying to enjoy themselves, kicked up an awful noise; 
The game they played was one which I 
had never seen before, 
But what drew my attention was to hear these urchins roar. 
CHORUS. 
Hi Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig,

Returning to my friends to dine, I 
being a 
good young man, 
They asked me if I'd say the grace before the meal began, 
All eyes were closed, each head was bent, hands clasped in 
style devout, 
I 
meant to say it proper, but instead I 
blurted out. 
CHORUS—Hi Cockalorum, & c. 
Now, after this, most strange to say, the phrase ran in my 
head, 
And though I 
tried to banish it, it never, never fled; 
I 
took to drink, I 
tried the turf, balls, concerts, or the play, 
But no odds what the music was, to me it seemed to say. 
CHORUS.—Hi 
Cockalorum, & c. 
Each girl who used to think me nice, soon put me down 4, 
bore, 
Instead of warm receptions, I 
was cooly shown the door, 
At every such rebuff, of Course, I 
asked the reason why 
And each bewitching damsel said in accents sweetly shy.

Jerry Slattery was a 
tailor, he was ninety years of age, 
He had a 
son named Micky, a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Romeo with his sister, for diamonds he'd give her 
pork and beans, 
Then little Michael Slattery would tear the bedclothes up for 
scenes. 
He is crazy, he is lazy, he broke his leg last week, 
lie is always singing, always dancing, and playing tragedy in 
his sleep. 
He is always talking of Mary Anderson, he'd support her on 
the stage, 
Sure last night he got so crazy, we had to put him in a 
cage. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery stole his father's pants, 
He cut them up for tights to do a 
song and dance; 
When his mother was asleep he cut her hair off for a 
wig, 
Now little Micky Slattery is doing an acrobatic jig. 
He cut off his father's whiskers to play Hamlet and King Lear, 
look a 
shot gun to his mother and made her walk off on her ear, 
He learned his sister dancing, cut off eleven of her toes, 
Now little Micky Slattery is singing tenor through his nose. 
For he's dramatic, he's lunatic, he is clean gone off his base, 
His father and his mother say he is 
Celebrated Case, 
He says he takes the cake, as an 
he beats them all, 
Next week he plays Julius Caesar down at Solomon Duff's 
hall.

Written, composed and sung by BONNIE RUNNELLS with great 
success. 
—:o 
;----
There is a 
sweet town, Hoboken is the name, 
It's noted for bed-bugs, mosquitos for fame; 
They wait till the night-time when you get in bed, 
And they sing Billy Ta2:,lor all round your poor head. 
CHORUS, 
They're always a 
biting, and never stop fighting; 
They sting you like lightning, and your nose they are 
lighting; 
They'll never stop biting, but always keep fighting; 
These sweet little birds of Hoboken. 
One night I 
was sitting and reading the news, 
When one came a 
waltzing away with my shoes; 
He came back for my socks and he found them so loud, 
He was bound for to have them so he brought the whole 
crowd. 
1 
made up my mind to catch these young scamps, 
With two guns in my hand and a 
kerosene lamp: 
And before I 
retired I 
got down for to pray, 
And they took guns and lamp and they whistled good day; 
Now take my advice when you go to that town, 
Just cover your head with your mother's night-gown; 
Just put a 
free lunch at the head of your bed, 
With some St. Jacob's oil and you'll find them all dead.

KATE FROM OLD KENTUCK. 
Words and Music by JOHN M CVEIGH. 
Originally sung by M ISS KATE M ONTROSE. 
My little Kate from old Kentuck, 
I 
love her, oh! so well, 
I 
love her in the morning, noon and nigh, 
I 
love her in the evening, 
When the twilight shadows fall, 
I 
love her pretty, blue eyes, bright 
I 
learned to love her years ago, 
And her ways I 
did admire; 
I 
loved her first in school-boy days, 
She did my heart inspire. 
CHORITS: 
My little Kate whom none could hate, 
To win you was my good luck; 
My charming Kate, my pretty Kate, 
My Kate from old Kentuck. 
I 
love her in the spring time. 
When the summer roses bloom, 
I 
lovelier in the autumn just as well, 
I 
love her in the winter, 
When snow it cloth appear, 
And chilly winds creep round our cosy dell; 
I 
love her for herself alone, 
Far dearer than my life; 
I 
love her for her gentle ways, 
That's why I 
call her wife. 
(Chorus).

The prettiest girl in all this town lives just across the way 
I'm going to call on her and see if she will name the day; 
She is very sweet on both of us, which one she cannot say, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
She promised to be mine, and said how happy we would be 
Before I 
went away she said she loved no one but me; 
She may be fooling both of us, but now we're going to see 
Which one shall wed Miss Katie Ann O'Connor. 
CHORUS ; 
Katie Ann O'Connor she is the prettiest girl I 
know, 
Katie Ann O'Connor said I 
might be her beau; 
She is sweeter than the flowers that in the garden grow, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. ( Repeat). 
Now all the boys around the town have got her on the brain 
The girls they are so jealous that they're mighty near insane; 
But Katie she don't notice it, she loves me just the same, 
Such a 
pretty girl is Katie Ann O'Connor. 
So now we are going to leave you, and will come som e 
other time, 
And when we do, we'll let you know when the marriage 
bells does chime; 
To the wedding we'll invite you all, and won't we have a 
time, 
With this pretty girl, Miss Katie Ann O'Connor.

JAMES O'NEIL'S PARODY ON 
Grandmother's Chair. - 
Revised and sung by JAMES O'NEIL & JOHN CONROY, in all the 
leading \ anety Theatres in the United States. 
My Grandfather he, at the age of 1,000 and 3, 
He worked upon a 
farm catching bees; 
It was him discovered pie, and he had a 
leather eye, 
And his necktie was a 
boarding house for fleas; 
His lungs was made of wood, and he never was any 
good, 
lie could walk upon the water and never sink; 
His nose was very long, and his breath was very strong, 
He'd chew up porous plasters, soap and ink. 
CHORUS: 
But now he has departed, he bought a 
pair of wings to fly, 
Now he's painting clouds and frescoing the sky; 
He'd never refuse a 
drink, and he always had blues, 
And when he died he left Dr. Tanner his old pair of shoes. 
When he grew up to be a 
man, he had five toes upon 
each hand, 
And he married a 
girl called Arrabella Green; 
They were married just one year, and don't you think 
it queer, 
They had a 
family the finest ever seen; 
While smoking a 
clay pipe, his eldest boy named Mike, 
Was playing with a 
puzzle made of blocks; 
When seven million dollars and 3,000 paper collars, 
Fell out of my Grandfather's socks. 
(Chorus). 
He was never known to eat, he had 14 set of teeth, 
And he never wore pants in all his life; 
He was crossed in his thumbs, he had whiskers on his 
gums, 
And with ice cream he tried to choke his wife; 
One day he pawned his eye for to buy some rock and rye, 
He got wrestling with a 
brick and broke his head; 
He slept upon a 
bog, he never changed his socks, 
And now I'm told the poor old man is dead. 
(Chorus). 
AIN'T HE A 
BABY. 
Words and music by Tut ROGERS, as sung by him with grea4 
success at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theater Comlque. 
I 
Am a 
swell. I 
lead the style; 
I'm not Champagne Charlie nor Tommy Coaloil. 
But you can see plain by my winning ways 
That I 
am a 
man that has seen better days. 
But for all that I 
don't care a 
straw, 
For I'm lint au lively as ever, ha, ha! 
The pet of the girls I 
meet every day, 
And as they pass by me this is what they say: 
Oh., my, ain't he a 
baby' 
Look at his walk—it's just like a 
lady 
Oh dear, I 
believe it is Grady! 
Look at his nice curly hair. 
Look at me well. 
Do I 
look green? 
I 
have an eye that can capture a 
queen. 
With my graceful walk I 
make their heads whirl; 
My great Colorados the barbers do curl. 
I 
am a 
gambler at high jack and '
ow; 
I 
can play seven out and the great casino. 
There's no use in talking, now don't I 
look sweet? 
For as the girls vass =Ile you'll hear them repeat: 
Oh, my, etc.

AN IRISHMAN'S TOAST. 
As sung with great success by TONY PASTOR. The greatest and 
most popular song in New York. 
Don't call me weak-minded, perchance I 
should sing, 
Of the dearest old spot upon earth; 
And don't think me foolish should memory bring, 
To my mind the dear land of my birth; 
With its hills and its valleys, its mountains and vales, 
Of which our forefathers would boast; 
Of a 
dear little island all covered with green, 
Ah, but list' and I'll give you an Irishman's toast. 
CHORUS: 
Here's to the land of the shamrock so green, 
Here's to each boy and his darling colleen, 
Here's to the ones we love dearest and most, 
May God speed old Ireland, that's an Irishman's tout. 
My mind's eye oft pictures my old cabin home, 
Where it stood by the murmuring rill, 
Where my playmates and I 
oft together did roam, 
Through the castle that stood on the hill; 
But the stout hand of time has destroyed the old cot, 
And the farm now lies barren and bare; 
Around the old porch there is ivy entwined, 
But the birds seem to warble this toast in the air. 
(Chorus). 
The church and the schoolhouse have long been replaced, 
In the Harp Hotel dwells a 
new host; 
The white-haired old veteran has long been at rest, 
And his wife has deserted her post; 
King Death, the stern reaper, has called them away, 
And their children have gone o'er the seas; 
There is nothing but strangers around the old spot, 
Still this toast seems to waft to my ears on the breeze. 
(Chorus).

Gas House Explosion. 
Written and sung by the SPARKS BROTHERS, in their original sketch, 
entitled " The Gas House Explosion," and performed in all the 
principal Theatres throughout the United States. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Good evening to you, one and all, 
We just come out for to sing to you a 
song; 
It is all about when we landed in America, 
And we won't detain you long. (Break.) 
When we first landed in America 
We were hired for a 
dollar a 
day, 
Shoveling smoke down in the gas house— 
And all the Irish boys would say: 
CHORUS. 
Come all you boys and join together, 
Hands all round, and we'll all say shake. 
Balance all and swing your partners, 
All the Irish boys would say. (Repeat Chorus.) 
When we first landed in Castle Garden 
We went up-town to buy us some flutes, 
And we went over on the Bowery 
And all the boys said we were galutes. (Break.) 
And now, kind friends, we must be going, 
For with you we cannot stay; 
We must go back to the gas house 
Where we get our dollar a 
day. 
Come all you boys, &c.

I 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND ; CAN YOU? 
Written and sung at Harry Miner's Theatre. N, T., by FRANK Lim's, 
with unbounded applau.se. 
I'm not a 
wise man, but yet I'm no fool, 
I'm an American boy strong and hearty, 
I 
never mix up in political rings, 
I 
belong to the workingmen's party; 
There's the devil to pay in the papers each day, 
And half what you read may he true; 
But why people believe every word that they say, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why Russia's great Czar was blown from hts car, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
Now there's Mr. Jones, my neighbor next door, 
Of a 
family he has quite a 
number; 
He's lk)een married, I 
think about six years or more 
With six babies his life to encumber; 
While there is poor me, who's been wed about three 
And as yet there is nothing_to show; 
But why such things should be, is quite funny to 
And I 
can't understand, can you? [me, 
CHORUS: 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why our Commissioners haven't seen that our 
streets are kept clean, 
I 
can't understand it, can you? 
47 
' 
CAN'T UNDERSTAND, CAN YOU?— Coymiruno 
Now there's General Grant, our Ex-President, 
He fought for the Star Spangled Banner; 
But the people do say that he'll fast forty days, 
For every one knows he's a 
Tanner; 
Ile has also been over Europe I'm told, 
They say he's as rich as a 
Jew; 
But why he don't retire to sweet private life, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
Cnonts; 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
Why we have a 
Mayor, by the way, who says 
Grace every day, 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
There's the handsome young lady, the belle of the 
day, 
Who is always dressed up in the fashion; 
Her beautiful form is developed to sight, 
She looks very stylish and dashing; 
With a 
sweet little bang on the front of her head, 
And she's made up quite pretty to view; 
But why she combs her hair on the back of a 
chair 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
CHORUS: 
I 
can't understand, can you? 
I 
don't understand, do you? 
If John Kelly went back on his brother Democrats 
I 
can't understand it, can you?

THE JOLLY OLD SAILOR. 
Written by JOHN W ALSH, and dedicated to and sung by NED BattaX 
at the Theatre, Comique, N. Y. 
-: 
0 : 
What curious people we meet 
As through this world we go; 
Some are full of deceit, 
While others honesty show; 
Some on mischief are bent, 
If you far from it will roam; 
And others like to interfere, 
With business that's not their own. 
Some will swear that white is black, 
And green is no color at all; 
And others seem to take delight 
in watching another man fall; 
But when inquisitive people 
Wish to know anything from me; 
I 
tell them to ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. 
CHORUS: 
For the jolly, old sailor, has been to sea, 
Where the stormy winds do blow; 
And as the sailor has been to sea, 
He's the man that ought to know. 
Old Brigham Young he is dead, 
In picture shape they show 
A 
comical sketch of his bed, 
And his forty wives also; 
z 
THE JOLLY OLD SAILOR—CONTINUED. 
With sixty babes in the front, 
His breeches you'll see hanging there; 
Now there's a 
chance for young girls, 
Who would like the breeches to wear. 
Just fancy having forty wives, 
To please and amuse every one; 
They tell me Brigham did it, 
But it's wonderful how it was done; 
For I 
have one, and upon my word, 
She's more than enough for me; 
And one's a 
dose, I've heard it said, 
By the sailor that's been to sea. ( Chorus). 
There's Smikes just over the way, 
He gets so awfully wild; 
And grumbles all the day, 
Because he's not blessed with a 
child; 
Whilst Smith can boast twenty-four, 
And looks with a 
doleful phiz; 
And says that Smikes should be compelled, 
To keep a 
few of his kids. 
Now when they meet, it's quite a 
treat, 
It causes a 
deal of fun; 
For the one that's got no children, 
Asks the other one how it is done; 
One says this, and the other says that, 
But when they refer to me, 
I 
tell them to ask the sailor, 
For the sailor has been to sea. (Chorus).

Glass Put In. 
Written by DAVE HOWARD, and sung by him in " Glass Put In." 
Here I 
am, a 
Hebrew man, 
And glass I'll put in cheap; 
For fifteen cents a 
single pane, 
You bet I'll do it neat. 
I'll put them in most any size, 
And my price is very small; 
So, if you want some glass put in, 
I'll go and give you a 
call. 
CHORUS. 
0, glass put in. 
Say, glass put in? 
Say, missus, you want some glass put in ? 
I'll do the job so nice and clean, 
You'll find that I'm no cheat; 
0, glass put in. 
Say, glass put in ? 
Say, mister, you want some glass put in ? 
That's what I 
holler the whole day long, 
As I 
go through the street. 
The gang they throw big stones at me 
Whenever I 
go out, 
And from the windows in the street 
You can hear the people shout : 
Say, mister, here, and mister, there, 
I 
want to give you a 
job ; 
Because I 
put them in so fine, 
And they know that I'm no slob.

There is a 
little lady that keeps a 
grocery store, 
The number is nine, Bowery, below Grand; 
She is a 
little beauty the one that I 
adore. 
And her mother keeps a 
little oyster stand. 
I 
go to see her evenings, to hear her play and sing, 
For she is the girl to entertain a 
gent; 
For playing on the harp, the whole town knows she's 
smart, 
For sho's a 
girl of great accomplishment. 
CHORUS. 
She plays the piano, 11e harp and concertina, 
And in a 
ball room you should see her whirl; 
She sings Emmet's Lullaby, Mascott sand Josephine, 
What a 
little treasure is my Bowery girl. 
You ought to see her evenings, way out at Rockaway 
Bathing in the surf and on the beach 
She gives an exhibition in her wet weather clothes, 
And how the female highbred ladies screech. 
She's a 
lady of the town and she wears her own night 
gown, 
When she dives under water I 
see her curl; 
When she sinks within the bottom why the under-
ground is rotten,

I 
am Mike Looney the Wrestler, 
Down me if you can; 
I 
threw Homer Lane in the gutter, 
Near killed John McMahon; 
I 
am the champion of Ireland, 
No one can give me a

When I 
threw Bibby and Miller, 
I

can down them all. 
CHORUS: 
I 
can break McLaughlin in half, 
The girls on me are spooney; 
They all know I

I

Last Summer in England, 
I 
downed over thirty-eight; 
Queen Victoria kissed me, 
And said I 
could'ut be bate; 
I

Near broke their necks with the fall; 
Napoleon bet twenty-five dollars, 
That I 
could down them all.

MICHAEL BRADY'S SHIRT. 
Composed and sung by GEO. W . 
CALLAHAN, the Ventriloquist. 
My name is Michael Brady, and I 
am not ashamed to own. 
I 
am honest and I 
am dacent if I 
am only left alone; 
)3ut the gang that hangs around me they are a 
terrible clan, 
And when I 
moved around them I 
was like a 
crazy man. 
They roar and bawl the whole night long, with conversa• 
tion strong, 
I 
haven't slept for forty nights in the house where I 
belong. 
Now the first one to kick up a 
row was Chateau Jane McGee 
If my wife don't go up and fight with her, she'll come and 
fight with me. 
She stole a 
shirt from our back yard, and gave it to her 
son Dan. 
I 
took it from his back in a 
ball-room, by the owner I 
am 
the man. 
I 
made a 
holy show of him, I 
ran him down like dirt, 
And he near goes mad when the boys all cry: " Who stole 
Mike Brady's shirt?" 
Their rooms is to let in the parlor, Italians just moved in, 
With fourteen harps and fiddlers, all dacent working min. 
What Mary McGaskin did last night, I 
swear it was a 
sin, 
She trun her durty dish-water on the mackirony min. 
Such holy murder you never heard, since the day that you 
was born, 
Was among them darned Italians in the house where I 
belong. 
Now there's my daughter Johanna, she sings ilianne a 
store, 
She goes to balls and picnics with a 
huzzy of a 
girl next 
door. 
Merarling's boy he stole a 
goat and he put it in our wood-
shed, 
If he ever does the like agin, I'll brake his father's head. 
I 
am glad I 
am going to leave them to let them bawl and 
shout, 
I'll take down the stove to-morrow and be Heavius I'll 
move out.

While you are ragged, too, 
And famine stares us in the face, 
Oh, what are we to do.

Oh, what are we to do, dear wife. 
I

The grocer's bill is over due, 
The mill shut down to-day. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The coal is nearly gone, 
And see, there's scarcely wood enough 
To kindle in the morn; 
The landlord will be coming soon 
To get the rent from you, 
And I 
have not a 
cent to pay 
The bills becoming due. 
Oh, what, &-o. 
The mill shut down to-day, dear wife, 
The snow is on the ground, 
And hark! the piercing winds without 
How mournfully they sound; 
The children have no shoes to wear, 
They cry for milk and bread, 
But, wife, the mills have stopped to-day, 
How shall we all be fed ?

THEY SAID I 
COULDN'T DO IT, BUT I 
DID. 
Written and sung by BEN DODGE. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, and toddled off to school, 
The people one and all declared that Pd grow up a 
fool, 
Their sneers and jeers would greet me whichever way I'd turn, 
Because they said good common sense I 
surely ne'er would 
learn; 
But they were not so much:to blame, for 'twixt both you and me, 
It nearly took me a 
whole year to learn my A, B, C, 
But I 
succeeded, and at last of their abuse got rid, 
'They said 'twas what I 
could not do, but they now confess I 
did. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! they said I 
couldn't do it but I 
did, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did; 
They vowed I'd be a 
fool, 'cause I 
couldn't learn at school, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did. 
'As year by year I 
older grew, of couse I 
fell in love, 
Twos with a 
bright and charming girl, fair as the skies above, 
But something very strange, and which I 
could not understand, 
I 
ne'er could muster courage up to ask her for her hand; 
I 
called each night, of course, to tell the oft-repeated tale, 
But when the question tried to pop, my nerve would somehow 
fail, 
My friends laughed at me, till one day, with pleasure I 
confess, 
The words slipped out " Will you be mine?" and my darling 
answered " Yes." 
59 
Cnoxus. 
! 
they said I 
couldn't do it, but I 
did, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, out I 
did; 
Now everybody knows, it's a 
hard job to propose, 
They said I 
couldn't do it, but did. 
My wife and I 
have married been for full three years or more, 
No children have we raised, and I 
felt tender on that score, 
For every day some friend of mine in joking tones would sneer, 
And say 'twas his opinion that the case was rather queer 
It's bothered me much more, my friends, than I 
care to reveal. 
But at last it has come out all right, and awful proud I 
feel, 
Each friend I 
meet upon the street to wish me joy begins, 
For to-day my wife presented me with a 
bouncing pair of twins. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! they said we couldn't do it, but we did, 
They said we couldn't do it but we did; 
Now we've got a 
girl and boy, who cause us the greatest 
joy, 
They said we couldn't do it, but we did.

A 
Leaf of Ivy from my Mother's Grave. 
Originally composed by CHARLES A. 
Sevinne, and sung with great 
success in all the leading theatres in America. 
—:o: 
I 
went to Greenwood yesterday, 
To visit my angel mother's grave; 
Gently I 
knelt beside the mound, 
And took a 
leaf of Ivy from the grave; 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow • 
And ' Us only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
CHORUS: 
Mother's dwelling with the angels, 
With a 
crown upon her brow; 
And 'tis only in my visions, 
That I 
see my angel mother now. 
Mother died when I 
was quite young, 
And it soon broke up my home; 
Soon I 
found I 
was rot welcome, 
And like a 
stranger I 
did roam; 
All I've got now to remember her, 
And which I 
cherish and will save 
Is this little leaf of Ivy, 
A 
leaf of Ivy from my mother's grave. 
(Chorus). 
Since mother's death I 
feel forsaken, 
And o'er the wide world I 
have roamed; 
Until, when my poor heart was breaking, 
With my brother, then, I 
found a 
home; 
From mother we'll not long be parted, 
Soon we'll meet her up above. 
Where we'll ne'er again be parted, 
But will live in joy and endless love. 
(Chorus),

The Greatest Trick 13ook of the Age. 
HIIMPTY DI1MPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by cat

ONRIAPI1"01101hPlielaft 
, 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic ordei 
has been sent us, called 
ilIIMPTY Dultrrx,' and bounl 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear, 
mice of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap 
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Rislin Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-,
