Finding Roots: Asian American Farmers in Contemporary America 
Scott Chang-Fleeman 
January 12, 2021 
Interview conducted by Katelyn Reuther 
Scott Chang-Fleeman is the founder and owner of Shao Shan Farm in Bolinas, California. 
This was a 
remote interview conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Scott Chang-Fleeman 
joined the interview from Bolinas, California, and Katie Reuther joined from Boston, 
Massachusetts. 
Interview Log 
00:00:00 
Introductions 
00:00:27 
Scott describes his family's food culture when he was growing up. He comes 
from a 
mixed race family. His mom 
is Chinese American, and his dad is white. 
His mom and grandmother were born in the United States, and his great-
grandparents immigrated here. His mom's dad was born in China and immigrated 
here as a 
young adult, but he passed away in his early forties. There was a 
bigger 
severing of the immigrant experience for his mom and her siblings' generation. 
00:02:50 
Because they are mixed race and have been living in California for several 
generations, their family food culture is interesting. Scott identifies strongly with 
the Chinese American identity marker, rather than the strictly Chinese one. For 
holidays and special occasions, his family would go out for dim sum, and 
birthdays and weddings would revolve around big banquets. In the home, Scott's 
mom cooked a 
lot, but she didn't cook Chinese food. She said that it was easier to 
eat out, because Chinese food was too complicated to make and had too many 
ingredients. 
Scott's grandmother grew up with more of a 
classic immigrant experience. She 
grew up eating home-cooked Cantonese meals, which then led to her continuing 
to cook these dishes for Scott and his sister when they were younger. As they got 
older and moved to a 
different side of Los Angeles, they stopped eating those 
traditional Cantonese and Chinese home-cooked meals. Scott didn't grow up with 
Chinese food in the home, but it was always the default gathering and celebration 
meal. This means that although he grew up with a 
lot of dishes, he knew nothing 
about how they were prepared.

00:05:17 
As a 
kid, Scott didn't have a 
lot of interest in learning more about the history of 
Chinese food or how to prepare it. 
00:05:44 
When he went to college, Scott became interested in food from the perspective of 
the environmental movement and sustainability. He studied environmental 
studies, and was drawn to the ways food production and food chains contribute to 
global warming and environmental degradation. 
During his time as a 
farm apprentice at the University of California Santa Cruz, 
he started to connect identity and food. The longer he lived outside of Los 
Angeles in Santa Cruz, the more he felt cut off from access to good Chinese food. 
Through the lens of food and agriculture, Scott started to explore his own identity 
as a 
mixed race Chinese American, and what it means to be Chinese American 
and biracial. 
00:07:47 
Scott learned about food and farming in college from an academic perspective. He 
learned about how different farming practices impact soil structure and soil 
carbon, and about nutrient runoff and leaching in conventional agricultural 
systems. At the end of his sophomore year in college, he started interning at a 
student garden cooperative. He fell in love with the work of gardening and the 
physicality of growing food. Quickly, his studies moved away from 
environmental studies to focus on agroecology, how agriculture affects the 
environment, and the practicalities of growing food. 
After interning at the garden cooperative, he wanted to learn more and started 
interning at the university's farm. The farm manager there was also half Chinese 
American, and was one of Scott's two Asian American mentors at UC Santa Cruz. 
Seeing someone with a 
similar background and upbringing who looked like him 
encouraged Scott to think farming could be a 
reality for him. After that, he spent 
all of his time on the farm. 
He graduated early to take a 
job on an educational farm in Los Angeles at one of 
the Claremont colleges. After realizing his knowledge was quite limited, he 
moved back to Santa Cruz to do the full farm apprenticeship program there. 
00:10:31 
Scott describes the structure of the apprenticeship program. When he was there, it 
was a 
six-month residential program. Forty people lived, worked, and learned 
communally on the farm. They rotated through different field and garden sites, 
worked with different mentors, and learned about different aspects of agriculture 
with a 
breadth-over-depth approach. Scott stayed on for a 
second year to focus on 
a 
specific site, which was all tractor-cultivated ground. 
Scott Chang-Fleeman Interview Log, January 12, 2021

At that point, he knew he wanted to be a 
farmer growing on a 
tractor-scale. 
During his second year, he got to dive deeper and spend a 
whole season on the 
farm. He learned how to drive a 
tractor, fix equipment, troubleshoot, and think on 
a 
systems level about how to grow large quantities of food in an efficient and 
sustainable way. 
00:12:20 
After interning at the garden cooperative in college, Scott held romanticized 
visions of farming. He imagined living on a 
big property, growing his own food, 
and having animals. As far as seriously wanting a 
farm as his livelihood and as a 
business, he started to think about how to become a 
farm business owner toward 
the end of his first year apprenticing. 
00:13:12 
The process of starting his own farm began while Scott was apprenticing at UC 
Santa Cruz. During his time as a 
second-year apprentice, he did an individual 
project that centered on learning how to grow organic Chinese vegetables. Up 
until that point, he had a 
few years of experience learning about horticulture and 
agriculture from a 
very European perspective (crop choice, growing techniques, 
philosophy around farming, the community of people he was farming with). 
This collided with the early- to mid-twenties identity crisis that a 
lot of people 
have. His personal project focused on growing Chinese vegetables as a 
means of 
building a 
connection to the vegetables he grew up eating, and as a 
container for 
learning more about Chinese food, cooking, and the larger Chinese diaspora. Scott 
used his project as a 
launching pad to explore a 
lot of topics, and it acted as a 
way 
for him to bring bigger topics back to agriculture and what he was growing. 
00:16:43 
Scott talks about growing up with two distinct families: a 
white family and a 
Chinese family. Growing up, he saw two different worlds and was the product of 
both of them. He says he wasn't fully part of one community. So much of his life, 
he was defined by being half of something, so this project was an attempt to 
define himself as being whole instead of as two separate halves. Scott also 
mentions the tension of being in spaces with white farmers who say racist things. 
They feel comfortable saying them in front of Scott because of his proximity to 
whiteness. 
00:18:55 
Scott's project was something he wanted to do, but it was also guided and 
influenced by some of the mentors and people he farmed with during the 
apprenticeship program. His friend and mentor, Kellee Matsushita-Tseng, runs the 
farm and garden site at UC Santa Cruz, and they approach everything from a 
perspective of race, class, and gender in agriculture. Exploring these topics with 
Kellee encouraged Scott to explore how he fits into the broader agricultural 
picture.

As a 
second-year apprentice, Scott went to a 
farming conference and heard 
Kristyn Leach of Namu Farm speak. Hearing about how Kristyn uses seeds, 
plants, and farming to explore what it means to be a 
Korean American adoptee 
resonated a 
lot with Scott in that moment. Scott notes that while being an adoptee 
and being biracial are very different, there are also some parallels. 
00:21:53 
Scott's mentors only had experience growing more mainstream Asian crops like 
napa cabbage and bok choy, not the wider array of Asian heritage crops that Scott 
was interested in growing. A 
lot of what Scott grows is informed by proxy crops, 
or those that have more English language resources around their cultivation. 
Because there isn't very much UC extension support, research, and literature 
around growing Chinese and Asian diaspora crops, Scott transfers knowledge of 
mainstream crops to similar crops that he is growing. 
00:23:10 
Scott chose to grow many of his vegetables based on the selection of seeds from 
Kitazawa Seed Company, which specializes in importing Asian vegetables. He 
also decided what to grow based on the vegetables he likes to eat and has distinct 
memories of (gai Ian, Choy sum, bok Choy, winter melon). 
00:24:37 
Scott was given more marginal spaces around the farm to use, in addition to 
access to equipment and money for seeds. He grew crops in orchard alleys 
between rows of trees and used the spaces where greenhouses met to grow hotter 
season crops like bitter melon. 
00:26:52 
It felt good for Scott to identify more fully with his Chinese side through cooking 
what he grew and learning more about the varieties. 
00:27:44 
Scott was growing everything for himself, but because he was growing at the 
field-scale, he had large quantities of vegetables with nowhere to go. Jokingly, he 
told his mentors he wanted to sell the extra produce to chef Brandon Jew of 
Mister Jiu's in San Francisco. The way Brandon Jew uses food and cooking to 
explore the complexities of his Chinese American identity resonated with Scott 
when he saw Brandon on a 
cooking show. One of Scott's mentors, Darryl Wong, 
had worked with Brandon in the past and offered to call him up. 
Brandon agreed to try out Scott's produce, and the next day, Scott drove to San 
Francisco with produce samples. Scott and Brandon got along well, and Scott 
liked the familial feel of the restaurant. Brandon emphasized how difficult it is to 
find local, organic, high-quality Chinese vegetables, and he told Scott he would 
buy his vegetables if he started growing them.

As Scott talked to more people about his potential farm plan, he received positive 
feedback right from the beginning. Aside from it being a 
personal project, it 
seemed like a 
community resource he could offer. 
While Scott is Asian American and Chinese American and being biracial is a 
big 
part of the broader Chinese American culture, there is also his unavoidable 
proximity to whiteness and privilege that differs from someone who is fully Asian 
American. To fully embrace his Chinese American identity and enter into the 
community as a 
farmer and as someone who wants to steward more Asian 
American farmers, he must feel like he is offering something to the community 
(as opposed to leveraging being half Asian American to sell Chinese vegetables to 
Chinese people). 
Scott wants to ensure that what he is doing resonates with the community, and 
that he is holding an important resource for people that wasn't available before. 
By stewarding crops in a 
respectful way, he gets to build deeper connections with 
these plants that so many people already have. While Scott is healing a 
severed 
relationship, he is allowing an existing relationship to continue for others in a 
way 
that doesn't compromise their ethics. 
00:33:24 
Scott says that when he told people about his business idea early on, everyone 
was excited by it. In the San Francisco Bay Area especially, there is a 
culture of 
sustainability and farmers market attendance. Ethical sourcing is a 
top priority. 
People told Scott that they stopped eating vegetables like gai Ian (Chinese 
broccoli), because they didn't want to eat something covered in pesticides that 
was potentially grown and harvested by underpaid workers. They were excited by 
the idea of continuing to eat the foods they love without compromising their 
ethics and values. 
00:34:36 
After deciding he wanted to start his own farm, Scott began looking for land. He 
thinks working on a 
production farm before you start your own farm is the best 
course of action. Scott had never worked on a 
for-profit farm, only in an 
educational farming context. The third piece of land he saw checked all of the 
boxes: good proximity to the San Francisco market; climatically very similar to 
what he was used to in Santa Cruz; and it had existing infrastructure. 
With a 
rare land opportunity and a 
rare customer opportunity in hand, his mentors 
told him it couldn't get much better than that. In addition, Scott was twenty-four 
years old when he started the farm, and he realized he only had one more year left 
on his parents' health insurance. 
00:36:53 
Scott brought his first produce sample to Brandon Jew in June, and by August/ 
September, he was looking for land. He selected the piece of land and signed the 
Scott Chang-Fleeman Interview Log, January 12, 2021 
5 
lease by October thirtieth. After his apprenticeship ended in mid-October 2018, he 
moved up to the farm and started the planning process. In January 2019, he 
incorporated as an LLC (limited liability company). 
00:38:04 
Brandon Jew not only offered moral support, but also gave Scott a 
personal loan 
for about a 
quarter of the money he needed to start up. He used this money for the 
legal paperwork to become a 
business, as well as for seeds and tools. Scott 
crowdfunded another quarter of the money, took a 
family loan for another quarter, 
and used the rest of his savings for the last quarter. 
00:39:25 
Scott gives a 
brief overview of his operation. He leases two contiguous parcels of 
land (five and a 
half acres total, about four and a 
half acres under cultivation) and 
specializes in cool-season Asian heritage vegetables like leafy greens and root 
vegetables, dry-farmed Asian winter squashes, herbs, Asian cucumbers and chili 
peppers. They sell at a 
San Francisco farmers market, a 
local farmers market, to a 
handful of Asian American-owned restaurants and grocery stores in the Bay Area, 
and they have a 
CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) that spans three 
counties (Marin, East Bay, San Francisco). The CSA 
is predominately Asian 
American folks in those counties. 
00:41:06 
Scott discusses how he selects what crops and varieties to grow. There are three 
spheres Scott considers when creating his crop plan: first, he's interested in the 
regional Chinese American or Asian American diet, and what it means to be 
farming for a 
community that's in diaspora. He notes that Chinese Americans 
have had a 
significant impact on the Bay Area broadly, and more specifically on 
its agriculture and cuisine. Scott wonders at what point we start to see and think 
about the California and Bay Area community as its own region of Chinese 
cuisine. What are the markers of that? 
With that in mind, what will define that regional cuisine? Scott cites the 
influences of geography, topography, and climate. While leafy greens and root 
vegetables can grow year-round in the cold, foggy climate and coastal summers, it 
doesn't get hot enough for things like bitter melon, winter melon, and a 
lot of 
fruiting crops. Thus, Scott focuses more on greens than other crops, and promotes 
letting the land dictate what the cuisine looks like. 
Next, Scott notes the role of culture, and how it impacts the way we interact with 
diet, cuisine, and the land. There are certain crops, such as winter melon, that are 
culturally significant but don't grow well in his area. For these types of crops that 
are culturally important but not necessarily regionally adapted, Scott is willing to 
implement different farming techniques to facilitate their growth (such as growing 
on black plastic mulch or in a 
green house or high tunnel). Scott wants to have 
culture guide what and how they will grow things. 
Scott Chang-Fleeman Interview Log, January 12, 2021

Lastly, Scott acknowledges the importance, beauty, and power of human/plant 
cohabitation and coevolution. He recognizes the role of farmers as seed keepers 
and seed stewards, and the ability of plants to evolve, adapt, and thrive over time. 
For example, Scott describes the process of developing a 
winter melon that is 
adapted to his regional climate. Each year, he would grow the winter melon 
without any special techniques to support its growth. He would then select and 
save the seeds from the plants that do well each year, plant them, and repeat the 
process. 
He finds that this slow, careful process resonates with a 
lot of people because they 
see it in their own communities. Scott likens this process to how people of the 
diaspora and subsequent generations change and adapt. It illustrates the beauty of 
how lived experience in a 
different place can alter communities of plants and 
people. 
00:47:45 
Scott talks about his customers: chefs who want particular ingredients, but also 
pride themselves on their ethics; people who already shop at farmers markets or 
are CSA members, but they want to eat more culturally relevant foods; people 
who are mixed race, adopted, or multigenerational Asian Americans who have a 
desire to connect with an Asian American diet. There are also older white folks at 
the local farmers market who like what they're eating and have fun with it. Scott 
introduces people to vegetables that are new to them and does it in a 
way that's 
not exploitative. He notes that a 
lot of Asian foods are exotified or "super-fooded" 
at farmers markets, stripping them of their cultural markers and importance. Scott 
strives to educate customers who are not Asian American, which he says other 
farmers might not be inclined to do. 
00:49:43 
Many of Scott's customers are extremely appreciative, which makes it all worth it 
for him. He has many regular customers who come to the San Francisco market 
every week, and he even has multiple regulars who drive up to two hours to come 
to the farmers market and shop at his farm's stand. That's exactly why Scott wants 
to do this, and why he wants to see other Asian American farmers growing Asian 
produce. 
00:50:51 
Although he's excited to see non-Asian customers, Scott doesn't see his role as 
one that prioritizes educating or introducing new produce to them. Instead, he 
focuses on growing high-quality, beautiful, tasty vegetables that are familiar to his 
Asian American customers. 
His target customer is an Asian American family in the Bay Area that has young 
kids and does a 
lot of cooking at home. They want to feed their kids the foods 
they grew up with, but that are healthier, free of pesticides, and grown in a 
way 
Scott Chang-Fleeman Interview Log, January 12, 2021 
7 
that aligns with their morals and ethics. The bulk of Scott's customers are young 
Asian parents. 
00:52:58 
Scott consciously wanted to include mechanization on his farm. He believes that 
while tractors and heavy machinery can do damage to the land, they can also 
steward large areas of land in a 
way that can't be done on a 
market garden scale. 
He also wants to invest in technologies that will improve the quality of work for 
his employees. This means doing tasks mechanically that would be physically 
draining or detrimental to employees' bodies. 
Scott purposefully chose to market to Asian American communities. He 
specifically wanted to sell at the Clement Street farmers market in the Richmond 
district of San Francisco, because it is a 
historically Asian neighborhood and has a 
large proportion of young Asian parents. He also does outreach to Asian 
American-owned restaurants and grocery stores, letting their needs dictate what 
he grows. 
00:55:21 
Scott describes the community he wants to build on the farm. He sees the farm as 
an important physical resource and place for people to gather. Previously at the 
farm, they held a 
celebration for the Chinese Qingming festival, as well as hosting 
a 
monthly potluck for the Asian community in west Marin County. 
When hiring employees, Scott tries to strike a 
balance between hiring Asian 
American and mixed Asian folks who have a 
strong connection to their Asian 
American identity and Asian American foodways but don't have experience with 
agriculture, and those that have experience with agriculture but are seeking to 
explore their own identities and foodways in a 
way they haven't before. Although 
Scott doesn't just hire Asian American folks, they are a 
large proportion of the 
applicants he gets. 
Scott also tries to build a 
culture of honoring work and labor. He intentionally 
works to create a 
community space where people come to the farm and engage 
with it in a 
way that builds community as opposed to exploits labor. For example, 
he will never have anyone doing any volunteer work that's monetarily beneficial 
to the business. Scott believes agriculture is too devalued for anyone to be 
working on a 
for-profit farm for free. 
Scott feels that he should be using his time to ensure that community members are 
benefiting, not the other way around. He wants his employees to be working in a 
way that feels seen, just, and well-compensated. He does not believe in unpaid 
farming internships or apprenticeships.

00:59:53 
Scott talks about the communities who have been important to his journey as an 
Asian American farmer: other Asian American farmers, many of whom 
belong to the Asian American Farmers Alliance; the Asian American community 
in west Marin who have supported Scott as a 
friend, community member, and 
farmer; the broader farming community from UC Santa Cruz, especially his 
knowledgeable and passionate mentors; and his family. 
1:02:17 
Scott's family is excited about his work. Both of his parents pursued their 
passions to do what they love, and he says they modeled the idea, "follow your 
dreams and the money will come." It's their dream that Scott is doing what he 
loves, and it's working to support him. 
1:04:01 
When considering how his mixed race identity plays into his work, Scott says he 
is always balancing his proximity to whiteness and to being Asian American. He 
must find the balance to ensure he's feeling his full, authentic self, while also 
thinking about where he fits within the community and broader spectrum of 
existence. He is in the process of figuring out what his roles are, and what it 
means to be an effective community member. 
The farm has shifted from being a 
personal project to explore his identity to 
something that's much bigger than himself. It represents a 
lot of things to a 
lot of 
people, and it's his job to continue to steward the farm as a 
resource. He also sees 
it as his responsibility to steward the experiences that people have with the farm, 
whether they are CSA or farmers market customers, employees, or workshop, 
holiday, or potluck attendees. 
As he interacts with so many different people, Scott's identity now revolves 
around what it means to be this farmer. He wants to make sure that people are 
benefiting from their interactions with the farm. 
1:06:53 
Scott's biracial identity has worked to his advantage, as has being third-generation 
Chinese American. He was able to start this business after generations of his 
family's assimilation and establishment in California. 
His identity and business plan have also worked to his disadvantage while looking 
for land. Some landlords have a 
specific idea of what they want grown on their 
land, and they don't see Scott's farm as a 
viable business. Instead, they see the 
Asian crops he is trying to grow as "exotic" and "specialty". They believe his 
business is too niche. 
1:09:48 
When Scott looks back at the last two years, one of his biggest takeaways is 
realizing he doesn't have to do everything on his own. The first season, he was the 
only employee. He worked around sixty hours a 
week on the farm, and twenty-
Scott Chang-Fleeman Interview Log, January 12, 2021 
9 
five hours a 
week at a 
night job. In 2020, he found things to be much easier when 
he hired employees. With that, though, he also had to let go of a 
lot of the farm's 
autonomy. 
His first year felt like the culmination of the personal project he started as an 
apprentice at UC Santa Cruz. The second year, he let go of that, and invited other 
people to interact with farming in the same way he had. 
Scott also learned his tolerances for stress management. He learned what he could 
tolerate, and he learned to accept things and let them go. He recognizes that 
because of the highs and lows of farming, it is hard to find emotional stability. 
1:12:34 
Looking forward, there are many changes Scott wants to implement on his farm. 
However, they all depend on the weather. Already into the second week of 
January, they have barely broken double digits of inches of rain in California. In 
addition, all of the farm's water comes from rainwater catchment in two 
reservoirs, which are both empty. 
Because of this, everything is paused, including the hiring process, the crop plan, 
and CSA sign-ups. Scott can't implement or commit to any changes until he 
knows if they have enough water to farm. If they don't get enough water, he will 
have to look for a 
different piece of land. If they get a 
big spring rain, he would 
have to postpone everything until then, including hiring and launching the CSA. 
If the weather cooperates, he wants to expand onto another acre of land, with the 
potential to add six more acres. He also wants to go from having one full-time 
employee and one part-time employee to having three full-time employees. 
Lastly, he wants to facilitate giving himself more time off (at least one day a 
week). 
Scott would like to institute a 
thirty-two to thirty-six hour work week instead of a 
forty-hour work week for his employees. Because the work is so rigorous, a 
forty-
hour work week in agriculture is much different than a 
forty-hour work week in a 
job that doesn't require the same amount of physical exertion. To do this, he 
would implement tools and technologies to increase efficiency and cut down on 
labor. 
1:16:23 
On a 
broader scale across the food system, Scott wants to see people pay more for 
food. This would also necessitate that the whole system for food assistance and 
subsidies be changed to support nutrition and small farm and rural economy 
viability. All of the costs associated with farming have increased dramatically 
over the past twenty years, but the cost of food at the farmers market has actually 
gone down. 
Scott Chang-Fleeman Interview Log, January 12, 2021 
10 
Scott also wants to see a 
national plan for addressing climate change. It would 
include steps for mitigating climate change, but it would also need to address the 
irreversible impacts farmers are already feeling. How can we continue to grow 
produce in this climate unstable world, and how can farmers continue to farm and 
stay financially viable? 
Scott calls for massive land and wealth redistribution, and he cites the Justice for 
Black Farmers Act as a 
step in the right direction. He also emphasizes the need for 
redistribution of land and wealth back to Indigenous communities, and for 
resource use and management to be transferred back to Indigenous management. 
1:20:33 
Scott advises BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, people of color) that are trying to get 
into farming to manage larger acreages. From speaking with BIPOC friends, Scott 
knows that there's a 
tension between having a 
deep desire to work the land, be 
farmers, and grow food, and the inability to move to rural communities that are 
predominantly white. These communities can not only be dangerous, but are also 
far from important community centers, support networks, foodways, and culture. 
Scott encourages folks to farm larger acreages to make a 
mark on rural 
communities and create resources and support networks for more people to be 
able to move out of the city.
