[Letter from C. E. Triggs to Roy Schroder, December 4,
1939]
December 4, 1939
Mr. Roy Schroder State Work Projects Administrator 49 West Duval Street Jacksonville,
Florida
Attention: Mrs. Rolla A. Southworth, Director Professional and Service Projects
Dear Mr. Schroder:
This is in reply to Dr. Corse's recent correspondence with Mr. Alan Lomax and Dr. Luther
H. Evans, which has been referred to this office. The request for the recording-machine
batteries and transformer has been approved by us.
Regarding the request for the loan of the Florida folksong records for demonstration before
a meeting of the Folk Arts Committee of Florida, there are several difficulties presented.
In the first place, the original discs should never be played for demonstration purposes.
Secondly, dubbings of the Florida records have not yet been made. These dubbings
likewise cannot be loaned except for transcripttion purposes. For demonstration and
study a special album of selections is being contemplated, since obviously a certain
amount of selection and arragement is necessary in preparing material for these purposes.
The state, however, may acquire a permanent set of duplicates at its own expense,
which includes the cost of discs and the cost of handling and duplicating the records.
Finally, the Joint Committee on Folk Arts of the Work Projects Administration is now in
process of reorganisation, for just such a service as is needed here, with the result that the
present, as well as further delay, is unavoidable. Meanwhile, we wish to assure the Joint
Library of Congress
[Letter from C. E. Triggs to Roy Schroder, December 4, 1939] http://www.loc.gov/resource/afc_corresp.afc_corresp_cor046
Committee on Folk Arts in Florida of our whole-hearted interest in its present progress and
future program, and of our desire to co-operate to the full extent of our ability.
Until the Washington Committee has been set up on a working basis, it would be advisable
for all correspondence to be addressed to this office. It would facilitate our record-keeping
if we could be 2 supplied at once with the following information, which is needed by the
Library of Congress.
1. Number of blanks received by you
2. Complete list of titles recorded, by number, including title, type, name of singer, place
and date of recording, name of recorder, and other documentation. (We have a check list
for eight records made by Dr. Alton C. Morris — the number of which was incorrectly given
as 9 in Dr. Corse's letter of October 24 — but not for the remaining 22 records.)
We are in receipt of the texts of the first sixteen records. May we inquire if these were
transcribed directly from the records, and by whom?
Regarding the blanks which Dr. Morris so kindly lent to the Florida recording expedition, it
would simplify matters if he were to be paid back with blanks from the supply sent to you.
Sincerely yours, C. E. Triggs, Director Community Service Projects
