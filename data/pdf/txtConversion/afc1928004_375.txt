MUTTON PIE. 
(Air—" Sweet Bye and Bye.") 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. 
FISHER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
Did you ever go into a 
saloon, 
Where they give you a 
free lunch with a 
beer, 
And when the proprieter's back is turned, 
All them bums to the counter they do steer. 
C !TORUS. 
Mutton pie, they all cry, 
And they chew as they never chewed before; 
Beefsteak pie, what do you soyie, 
We'll have meat on that beautiful shore. 
You can see them every hour of the day, 
Around on the corners they do stand, 
A-waiting for some one to treat, 
0 
they will bust up any soup-house in the land. 
CHORUS. 
Oyster pie, they all cry, 
For a 
plate of hash all night they loudly roar; 
And when they die, bye and bye, 
We'll have beats on that beautiful shore. 
Around our large hotels they can be found, 
They all have a 
lunch route of their own, 
They're the terror of the bake shops near and far, 
And at night to some hay-loft they do roam. 
Mutton pie, etc. 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
If you will listen to me, 
A 
ditty to you I 
will sing, 
And when you've heard it all through, 
Tears to your eyes it will bring; 
am a 
most innocent man, 
I 
never did harm any one, 
The other day a 
young man knocked me down, 
And said that he done it for fun. 
CHORUS. 
Dot's de kind of a 
man what I 
vas, 
Dot's de kind of a 
toothpick I 
vas; 
If you look once at me, you quickly will see— 
Dot's de kind of a 
hairpin I 
am. 
I 
thought me dot 
would get square, 
I 
met a 
poor paralyzed man, 
I 
quickly took him by the hair, 
And hit him just so with my hand; 
Of course they arrested me quick, 
To the jail I 
was taken away, 
He swore I 
hit him with a 
brick, 
And the judge asked me what I'd to say. 
Dot's de kind etc., 
NAUGHTY DUTCH BUM. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FisiiER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
You kave heard I 
am awfnlly naughty, 
I 
can't help but say it is true, 
I'm a _nasher, you see, with the ladies, 
And a 
friend to the old women too; 
I'm the favorite at all the parties, 
In the ball room I 
stand number one, 
And the young girls will murmur so sweetly— 
He is such a 
naughty old burn. 
CHORUS. 
So you see I'm so awfully naughty, 
Oh! so naughty, and so haughty; 
The policemen between sixteen and forty, 
Say I 
am such a 
naughty old bum. 
I 
met a 
young charmer one evening, 
As the setting sun rose in the West, 
She looked and she winked her eyes— that way, 
Then she quietly pulled down my vest. 
We were leaning so nice on the water, 
But she shook the son of a 
gun, 
But I 
stole her false teeth when she left me, 
For I 
am such a 
laughty old bum. 
So you see, etc. 
You notice my ulster's a 
new one, 
A 
gift from Napoleon the First, 
And I 
often think, yes, and wonder 
Whether it or my dice looks the worst: 
It's my style and my looks, not my clothing, 
That make ladies easily won. 
I 
have mashed Mr. Barnum's " what is it," 
For I 
am such a 
naughty old bum. 
So you see etc.,

DOT BOWERY AUCTIONEER.

SKELLY. 
Copyrighted by LARRY TOOLEY. 
I 
vas walkin' in the Bowery, 
Und the vedder it got showery, 
So I 
vent into an an auction, 
From the rainy atmosphere; 
Dere vas vatches by the tousand, 
Und I 
soon got much arousened, 
So I 
makes a 
bid, " Five dollars!" 
Mit dot Bowery auctioneer. 
He knocked it down to me, 
Und I 
vas full of glee, 
I 
put it in my pocket, 
Und he shouted in my ear— 
" 
Von't you buy sonic ladies' rings, 
rnd diamond studs mid tings ? 
Dese goods ate all imp.ated," 
Says dot Bowery auctioneer. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, dot vas de richest blace I

Dere vas a

Dere vas some 
young fellers in de corner makin' fun of everybody vat vas goin' 
Dey tried to make fun mit me, but I 
guess I 
vas too smart 
:,lready; 1 
didn't keep a 
lager beer saloon dwenty-seven years 
for nothing. 
I 
told one fellow to look out for me, for if I 
ever 
got me excited, he would tink maybe one of dem East River 
bridges fell over on him. Then he says. '' Say, Madly, what are 
vet giving us?" I 
told him I 
vas giving him nothing, " but," 
says I. ‘• you just come ' round by my blace some night mid get 
sonic drinks. mid try to stand me up' the same as your father 
n3ed to do. mid you'll see what I 
can give you." 
11 vouldn't 
ay any more, so I turned round to the auctioneer, who vas 
chewin' up words like a 
steam engine at full Nast—

Clloaus. 
Ye vas shouting, he vas Vain', 
Vile the counder he vas valkin', 
Oh. you never heard such. talkin',

(Repeat.) 
"Now I'll show you something splendid,

INFLATION. 
My beloved brothers and sisters and constituents, allow me 
to call your particular attention to the great fact thst is now 
agitation de public mind; if so, why not? can any man say 
otherwise, eh? 
This subject dat I 
am about to expound, my 
demoralized fellow- citizens and students, is that of inflat'on. 
If 
you get a 
Webster's unabridged spelling-book, and turn over 
the leaves, you will find something printed on them, and that 
something is the word inflatiou—blown up. 
Can any man say 
otherwise? well, if 
so, why not, eh? 
'Tis a subject that touches 
every one that stands under-
neath the folds of that glorious, ever-waving, star-spangled 
smasher, and reaches from the finest ladies in the land, inflated 
with her own beauty and the blood of youth, to the third-class 
politician, whose majestic soul soars lnto the realms of hash and 
fish- balls, snd thereby he is inflated by them. 
Now instead of calling a 
man a common drunkard, we oall 
him a 
universal inflationist. 
But where are we now ? for, if so, 
why not? 
Can any man say otherwise? 
Therefore, let us 
have plenty of it, and more too. 
I 
think as I 
stand here I 
can 
produce an argument that will convince you that a 
five dollar 
greenback is even better than a 
five dollar gold piece. 
Now, for 
instance, if a 
man has a 
five dollar gold piece, and it belongs to 
him, what does he do with it? 
Why he puts it in his pocket, 
and it he takes it out a 
year hence, what does he find it? Why 
a 
five dollar gold piece still, 
Now if a man has, on the other 
hand a 
five dollar greenback, and he goes to put it in his pock -
et, he doubles it, so to illustrate—don't he ? and if he takes it 
out in five minutes after, he finds it in-creases! 
Can any man 
say otherwise? 
Well, if so, why not ? 
But, for gracious sake, 
don't tell my mother-in-law that I 
said it, or there would be war 
in my domicile.

Copyrighted by A. 
J. FISHER, 98 Nassau St., N. Y. 
I'm a 
high-toned young fellow from Kalamazoo, 
I 
am known by a 
thousand or so, 
I 
can play seven-up from morning till night, 
Or drink lager wherever I 
go; 
I 
see my Louisa on each Sunday night, 
And I 
want you to all understand, 
That go where I 
may you will still hear them sav— 
That I 
always do good when I 
can. 
CuoutTs 
T 
always do good when I 
can, 
T 
always do good when I 
can ; 
So bear it in mind, for you'll everywhere find, 
I 
always do good when I 
can. 
I 
was out with the boys a 
few weeks ago, 
I 
passed by her house before going home. 
I 
felt pretty good—" just how come you so," 
And the police they let him alone; 
Well. I 
came to the house and there on the stoop, 
Sat Louisa with another young man, 
I 
grabbed him and busted his ten dollar hat, 
For I 
always do good when I 
can. 
I 
always do good, etc. 
On mischief you know I 
always am bent, 
In fact nothing else can I 
do, 
If a 
poor starving man asks the loan of a 
dime, 
lie gets a 
counterfeit or two ; 
met a 
young man I 
knew on the street, 
gladly took hold of his hand, 
Then borrowed a 
dollar to help the " Two Orphans," 
For I 
always do good when I 
can.

Ohl here I

A Deitcherman so gay,

What march around each day; 
We play for balls and picnics, too, 
I

But you should hear us play just once. 
Per tune called " Wacht ant Rhine." 
CHORUS. 
We play dot music sweet, 
And some dot's awful hard; 
We march away, so nice and gay, 
In front of the Mulligan Guard. 
(Repeat.) 
Our leader keeps a

Around in Stanton Street, 
And every Friday evening there, 
To practice we do meet; 
We play a

We Dutchmans lead a 
bully life, 
Mit Bender's Deitcher's band. 
We play, etc. 
Most all the target companies, 
What go out every day, 
Are sure to send and ask us 
If for them we won't play ; 
And when we march into the street.

HANS VON DINGLEKRALTS.,, 
His name was Hans Von Dinglekraus, 
Some peoples call him Sauerkraut, 
His boudoir's at the station house, 
And he runs a 
big free lunch route; 
His hair's in Auburn Prison, 
His eyes bright as a 
lark, 
And the Rhein Wine's always missing, 
When he swallows in the dark. 
CHORUS. 
Ta, ta, tra-la-lee, 
My soul s 
delight, 
I'll meet you by dot Bowery, 
At eight o'clock to-night; 
I'll mash you with a 
pie-crust, 
For every pull-back knows, 
The masher of the ladies, 
Is Hans Von Dinglekraus. 
His necktie is of hempen twist, 
It's color flaming red, 
He looks just like a 
New Year's Call, 
Underneath his gingham shed; 
His boots—he don't was got some, 
His bills he'll never tackle, 
His sure death on a 
schooner, 
And here's his sonorous cackle— 
CHORUS. 
Crirofie, Girofla, 
I 
must away, 
To get a 
bolivar, 
For a 
meal across the way ; 
The girls they all caress him. 
For every one allows, 
The bon bon of the ladies 
Is Han Von Dinglekraus. 
H, parts his hair with a 
comb. of counic? 
He don't was got some collar. 
His pa put money in a 
faro bank, 
And lost it, every dollar: 
He was book-keeper for Babbitt, 
But away from him did slope, 
And you can bet your dollars on it, 
That he's well fixed for 
soap." 
CHORUS. 
Slide along, hire a 
hall, 
I 
must go West, 
To join the Whiskey Ring, 
With Babcock and the rest. 
Then I'll go me to Havana, 
To meet Sharkey and the " Boss," 
And get ten thousand dollars, 
For finding Charho Loss.

HER FRONT NAME IS HANNER. 
As sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
The heart in my bosom has lately been stole, 
By a 
sweet blushing maiden, just nineteen years old; 
She's half Irish, blonde, and likes pork and beans, 
Her feet are a 
feature— she wears seventeens. 
CHORUS. 
Her front name is Harmer, 
Her father's a 
tanner, 
Him she does hammer, 
In an artistic manlier; 
She sings " Star-Spangled Banner," 
And " A Lean Banana," 
With a 
tooth-brush I 
fan her, 
When she thumps the planner. 
She wears a 
Moire Antique pull- back, cost six cents a 
yard, 
Her hat and parasol are made out of lard; 
She shall be a 
lady, like Judy O'Grady, 
For I've wealth (to get) and will keep it shady. 
Her front name, etc. 
Her mouth—well, it stretches from ear to ear, 
Whenever it's open I'm afraid to go near; 
Whenever she talks I'm never around, 
For I'm sure I'd fall in, and I 
know I'd get drowned. 
Her front name, etc.

While lonely I

'Tis a 
dear little mem'ry of love, 
How sad that it soon must decay, 
But fondly 1'11 treasure its leaves, 
Though their beauty may vanish away. 
Sweet moments of joy it recalls, 
And lulls every sigh to repose; 
Tho' now we're apart still my true lover's heart 
Seems to dwell in my pretty red rose.

Cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Brighter days are on the way, 
And the clouds so drear and dark, 
All will surely pass away. 
Flow'rs of spring will come again, 
Blooming sweetly o'er the lea, 
And the warblers of the grove 
Songs of love will chant for thee. 
CHORUF. 
Oh, cease thy weeping sadden'd heart, 
Drive away all idle fears, 
Let those clouds of grief and care 
Melt away in silent tears. 
Cease thy weeping sadden'd heart, 
Why thy face so wan and pale, 
has thy friend in death been laid 
'Neath the grasses of the vale? 
Ah! there is a 
fairer land, 
Where we meet no more to part, 
Let this cheer thee, gentle one, 
Let this soothe thy sadden'd heart. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, &e. 
Cease thy weeping sadden'd heart. 
Has thy loved one prov'd untrue, 
Has he broken every vow 
That he prornis'd only you ? 
Weep not for him gentle maid, 
He who would both woo and win, 
Then turn traitor to his word, 
Deep has drank of darker sins. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, &c.

Sweet visions of childhood, how bright they appear 
When our lives are o'erclouded with care; 
How fondly we dream of them year after year, 
And how lovely they are and how fair. 
Oh, bless'd are the scenes I 
ne'er can forget : 
Dearest mother so kind and so true; 
Sweet home that I 
left with the saddest regret, 
How my heart fondly turns unto you. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet visions of childhood return to me now, 
And I 
weep for the days that are past; 
My fond mother's kiss and her hand on my brow, 
In the days that were too bright to last. 
Sweet visions of childhood, how dear to each heart, 
Once again by a

Where the water Mlles grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly llow, 
Meet me darling Annie. 
When the whippoorwill cloth al, 
And the dewdrops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kiss me darling Annie. 
CHORUS. 
When the flowers fall asleep 
And the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I 
your heart may keep, 
Then, my darling Annie. 
Hearken to the turtle dove, 
Cooing from his nest above, 
List'iling to the tale of love. 
Whisper'd unto Annie. 
How he envies me the bliss. 
Pressing such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie. 
When the flowers fall asleep, &c. 
While the little stars do shine, 
Place your snowy hand in mine, 
Whispering softly " I'll be thine," 
Now, my darling Annie. 
From the clouds the moonbeams break, 
ShoNv'ring silver o'er the lake, 
Lisening to the vows I 
take, 
From you darling Annie.

I 
took my girl one day, 
A 
sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name; 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare, 
And one and all around her did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Ohl Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma; 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked them what they meant, 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye 
Emma began to scream, 
" 
Oh ! Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh! Emma, etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police!" 
And when he came he looked at me so sly; 
The crowd then at me laughed, 
And said I 
must be " daft," 
And once again they all commenced to cry: 
Oh! Emma, etP 
An old man said to me, 
" 
Why, young man can't you see 
The joke!" and I 
look'd at him with surprise! 
He said " don't be put out," 
It's a 
saying's got about; 
And then their voices seem'd to rend the skies! 
Oh! Emma, etc.

I'm going to wed a 
nice young lass, 
In beauty none can her surpass ; 
You may search the country all around, 
You'll not find one one like Susan Brown. 
Oh, I 
love Sue, and Sue loves me, 
We're happier thanking or queen can be; 
But Sue, you must know, has a 
cti , 
ions way, 
For when I 
go to kiss her she will always say: 
Citonus. 
Oh! dear me, let me be, 
Get away, do, oh! don't tickle me; 
Now then, Ted, stop your chaff, 
He, he, he, he, oh! you make me laugh 
I 
never shall the day forget, 
The first time I 
and Susan met; 
She was milking on a 
three legged stool, 
I 
called her duck, she called me fool. 
She gave me such a 
slap in the face, 
But I 
didn't mind that for I 
wanted to taste 
Her sweet pretty lips, like the roses so red, 
But when I 
went to kiss her, how she screamed and said: 
Oh! dear, etc. 
I 
said " I'll have one kiss," and then 
My arm went round her waist again; 
She shouted " Oh I 
feel so queer," 
She scratched my face and pulled my ear. 
But I 
held fast and declared that I 
Would either have a 
kiss or die; 
She said, " Well then, Ted, if you'll let me be, 
Just take one, ducky darling, but don't tickle me!" 
(Encore Verse.) 
I'm married now and settled down, 
With my dear darling, Susan Brown; 
We are happy as a 
pair can be, 
And toss the babies on our knee. 
But when I 
chance to come home late at night, 
She's bound to catch me, and ohl what a 
plight; 
For Susan don't stop to consider my plea, 
But with a 
pair of flat-irons she tickles me. 
Oh! dear ma, etc.

There's one sweet face in all this world, 
Whose smile to me is bliss, 
One pretty pair of pouting lips 
That I 
would love to kiss; 
And this fairy little queen is only seventeen, 
Her voice is sweetest music as it floats upon the air; 
Her style is very neat, and she has such tiny feet, 
And on her dainty finger is a 
sparkling solitaire. 
CHORUS 
She's deep blue eyes and golden hair, 
With dimpled Cheeks and face so fair; 
She's a

Upon her dainty finger 
Is a 
sparkling solitaire.

One moonlight night I 
whispered love 
Into her willing ear, 
She blushed and nestled to my side, 
And brushed away a 
tear; 
While my brain was in a 
whirl, I 
kissed this darling girl, 
We sat for hours so happy, and she said my lot she'd share, 
And then we did agree that next week we'd married be, 
And on her dainty finger is a 
sparkling solitaire. 
She's deep blue eyes, cte.

THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGG. 
A 
true illustration of life, written expressly for FRANK LEWIS 
by BOBBY NEWCOMB, America's Character Artist. 
When I 
was of age my father he left 
To me quite a 
snug little sum ; 
Ile says-- Now, my boy, good sense please employ, 
An,I remember you've reached twenty-one." 
My friends when they heard of what had occurred, 
How they hastened to borrow or beg ; 
For I 
flew a 
high kite, and they said, when in sight— 
" 
He's the goose with the golden egg." 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And people inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before, pronounced me a 
bore, 
And of my dress and my features made game. 
They'd laugh when 
joke, with me dine, drink or smoke, 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back, how they'd laugh and they'C 
clack, 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
The.girls all so fair, admired my hair, 
Pt was auburn—before it was red; 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when I'd smile, 
And mamas marked me fit to be wed. 
Their daughters thcy sighed, and sonic their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha and Meg; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown; 
Where'er I 
would call, they'd let me wait in the hall, 
And the message I'd_get—"Not at home." 
They'd giggle and jeer, where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass inc by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, and the egg turned to lead, 
I 
had bought my experience dear. 
Now my subject of rhyme may just be in time. 
For the world I 
don't care a 
peg; 
But what I 
would say—I

I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
letter that I've treasured many years ; 
Oh, how often I 
have read those fading lines, 
And over them there's traces of my tears; 
She sent to me her blessing in that missive, 
To see me was her constant prayer; 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is a 
lock of my angel mother's hair.

THE WATER 
MILL. 
As recited by Gus W ILLIAMS, at the Olympic Theatre. 
Listen to the watermill, through the livelong day, 
How the clicking of its wheel wears the hours away, 
Languidly the autumn wind stirs the greenwood leaves, 
From the fields the reapers sing, binding up the sheaves; 
And a 
proverb haunts my mind, as a 
spell is cast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Autumn winds revive no more leaves that once are shed, 
And .he sickle cannot reap corn once gathered; 
And the rippling stream flows on, tranquil, deep anti still, 
Never gliding back again to the watermill. 
Truly speaks the proverb old, with a 
meaning vast— 
The null will never grind with the water that is past. 
Take the lesson to thyself, loving heart and true, 
Golden years are fleeting by, youth is passing, too; 
Learn to make the most of life, lose no happy day, 
Time will never bring thee back chances swept away. 
Leave no tender word unsaid, love, while love shall last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Work while 3-et the daylight shines, man of strength and will, 
Never does the streamlet glide useless by the mill; 
Wait not till to- morrow's sun beams upon the way. 
All that thou canst call thine own lies in thy— to- day, 
Power, intellect and health may not always last— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh ! the wasted hours of life that have drifted by, 
Oh! the good we might have done, lost without a 
sigh! . 
Love that we might once have saved by a 
single word, 
Thoughts conceived, but never penned, perishing unheard, 
Take the proverb to thine heart, take and hold it fast— 
The mill will never grind with the water that is past. 
Oh! love thy God and fellow-man, thyself consider last, 
For come it will, when thou must scan dark errors of the past; 
And when the fight of life is o'er, and earth recedes from view, 
And Heaven in all its glory shines, 'midst the pure, the good 
the true. 
Then you'll see more clearly the proverb deep and vast— 
The mill wi'', never grind with the water that is past.

I've wandered very far away

No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields,

Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do;. 
My master too, he may be dead. 
His hair was turning gray, 
On, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain. 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again.

Composed and sung by CHARLES. KONOLLMAN, and sung 
by him at the Third Avenue Theatre, N Y., with great

New by-words we now have enough— 
Aye! hundreds, anciplenty to spare, 
They are cited by the high-toned and rough, 
But the latest 1 
think takes the,chair; 
You'll hear it wherever you go, 
And at it you'll not take offense, 
So I'll give it without more ado— 
The latest word out is " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
" 
You're a 
snide,"- and a " bloat," are played out, 
And " What do yer say ?" has no sense, 
But the latest of all you'll admit 
It suits, and " It's Simply Immense." 
We've affairs that have troubled our land, 
Concerning the people and State, 
The perambulation of Tweed 
In eluding the law was first rate; 
Now in Ludlow Street Jail he been caged, 
Minus some dollars and cents, 
And the police do proudly relate 
That his capture, you know, was " Immense." 
OPIORUS. 
"Pull Down Your Vest" is played out, 
And " Wipe off Your Chin" had no sense, 
But the latest you all will admit 
It suits, and " It's Simply Immense." 
In Brooklyn's great hour of sorrow 
Let us willingly stretch forth our hands, 
To help the poor widows and orphans, 
Rendered helpless through fire's fell brand ; 
The generosity of the actors we admire, 
It will be cited a 
century hence, 
Their generosity they showed by their wallets, 
And that you must say was " Immense." 
CHORUS'. 
So follow the actors' example, 
In the matter of dollars and cents, 
Let your sorrow be of these a 
sample, 
Then we shall say you are " Immense." 
Now to an end my song does approach, 
And I 
hope it's not been out of place, 
And that you don't think I 
encroach, 
But appreciate my efforts with grace; 
And if I 
ask for your applause, 
I 
hope you'll not take offence, 
And call here another time, 
Then you may think Charlie " Immense." 
CHORUS. 
" 
Pull Down the Blind's" getting dim, 
" 
Turn Down your Collar" had no sense, 
But this late one you all will admit 
It suits, and It's Simply Immense."

It's about this great city that's revelled in gold. 
The pride of our nation well tested above, 
In Philadelphia's great city of brotherly love. 
In the famine of late, though ' tis hard for to state, 
The thought of starvation, and sad was the fate 
Of tie many poor families who had nothing in store, 
Till a 
cry came from Heaven, " Give bread to the poor !" 
Now, there's A. T. Stewart, the New York millionaire, 
Who some time ago sought another world's care, 
Would it have hurt his kind heart to throw out a 
dime 
To keep our poor sufferers from prison and crime? 
He invested, I'm told, in a 
great institute, 
In a 
matter of business, you bet he was cute; 
He was not like Jim Fisk, nor will be many more, 
With his lightning express giving bread to the poor. 
There's another kind heart, tho' he has been misused, 
In South Carolina, where all was confused; 
He kept down the riot,- gave his office for peace, 
While the Rads, in the White House, they sat at theirea3c. 
In the town of Columbia, which all of you know, 
Their suffering was great with hunger and woe; 
With his shirt sleeves rolled up, like old Jackson at war, 
Stood Governor Wade Hampton giving bread to the poor.

TEMPERANCE SPEECH. 
A BURLESQUE ON JOHN B. COUGH'S SPEECH. 
Delivered by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
vill now make a few remarks on demperanee. I 
am no 
drinking man, never having drank a 
drop of liquor in my life— 
dot I 
paid for. 
I 
am no orator, but shall try to represend dot 
;4read demperance orator, John B. Gough, a 
man whoir I've ol-
den been daken for. 
Should I 
possess the eloquenc, of Gen-
eral Grant, I could give more scope to de subject I 
ayn now 
aiwnal to wrestle mit. 
Domperance is an old und yell vorn sub" ,.•,et, but like a 
Keno 
box ve can shake it ub, und get anoder number. 
It's very hard to approach a 
man vat ain't a- drinking; you're 
apt t) be met with—" 'Who tole you 
vasn't drinking ?"— 
" 
You mind your business, nnd I'll mind yours."—" Come und 
take a 
ball," und oder veil-known expressions used by politi-
cians. 
I 
vas called upon vonee to see vone of. de hardest cases of 
demperance it has ever been my good fortune to yitness. 
A 
man, who yen drunk vos de kindest of husbands; but yen sober 
he vos a 
perfect devil. 
I 
vent to de house, a 
beautiful brown 
curb- stone front, knocked de door down, und vent in. 
De man 
vos dere. 
I 
said to him—" Vill you please give me a 
drink of 
rater ?"—(de firsd dime I 
ever dook rater in my life.) 
He said, 
" 
Yes. sir: have a 
seat," pointing to a 
red-hot sdove. I 
de-
clined to sit, 
for various reasons. 
I 
spoke to him aboud Infia-
(lion, Seven Oud, but I 
avoided de subject of demperance. 
At 
45 
last I 
said, " You have a 
vite, i 
believe ?" 
He replied, " Yes, 
sir; de fifth one; red-headed." 
I 
said, " You love your vife, 
don't you ?" 
He said, " Veil, id's unnatural for a 
man to love 
his rife now- a-days." I 
said, " Don'd you dink of you vould 
sign dis paper, und go und get full vid me to-night, you could 
coml home, get a 
club, mid have a 
good deal of fun around de 
lious0" 
lie said, " Yes, I 
suppose ,so." 
I 
said, " You'll do 
ill?" 
He said, " I 
viii." 
I 
pulled oud a 
eoby of " Good-Look-
ing Snow," I 
laid id on de dable; he placed his nose in the ink-
und wrote his name. 
Just den a 
voice came from 
rioder room—(full of emodion 
und beer)—" Luke Gerloot!" 
De man said, " Come in mit me, 
Mr. Whooping-cough." I 
vent in dere, und his vile vos laying 
on abed, she vos dead—drunk. 
He knelt down mid printed a 
kiss )n 
her forehead in large types. 
She took his foot in her 
haw), looked up, mid said, " Oh I 
Luke is such a 
good husband 
venue's drunk, but yen sober, he's N. G!" (de first time I 
ever 
knev she spoke Latin.) 
De man said, " She says I 
am good!" 
at de same time pulling down de neck of his shirt, he showed 
me a 
second-hand scar. 
I 
said, " Vere you vaccinated dere?" 
His life said. " I 
cannot tell a 
lie, I 
done it mit a 
little hatchet." 
Of my lips had been dry yen' came in dere, I 
assure you dev

THE HERALD COMPLAINT BOOK. 
THE TROMBONE PLAYER. 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in the N". 
Herald, called the " Complaint Book," written by ToNY 
PASTOR, and sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, 
Pittsburg. 
of corirse in seareh of novelties are people now-a- days, 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald " Complaint 
Book." 
gPOKIIN.—ThiS is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Ur. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
fonnd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
sow, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will I 
show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint Book" 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, aud an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly overlook 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down on 
the book. 
SPOKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have neitler 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can kekl 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Comphint 
Book?"

DON'T YOU DO IT. 
Sung by the M URDOCH'S, with great success. 
We'll give you now some good advice, 
All in a 
friendly way, 
Concerning things that oft deceive, 
That happen every day, 
When hard times stare you in the face, 
And pocket-books are thin, 
Don't say there's no use trying, 
If you do you'll never win. 
CHORUS. 
Don't you do it! 
Don't you do it! 
For you know it never pays. 
Don't you do it! 
Don't you do it! 
Wait for better days. 
Oh! 
Don't you do it! 
Don't you do it! 
Never give yourself away. 
Don't you do it! 
Don't you do it! 
Mind what we say. 
Don't tret because your clothes are old, 
But keep your heart all right; 
Don't swear because you cannot sport, 
A 
diamond pin to-night; 
Don't make love to strange young girls, 
And say she charms your life; 
But first be N'ery careful that 
She ain't somebody's wife. 
Don't you do it, etc. 
Don't laugh at other people's faults, 
But first look to your own, 
When friends are few, because you're down, 
Just go it all alone; 
And when good luck comes on once more, 
We hope you won't wait long, 
And while you spend your greenbacks, 
Don't forget this little song. 
Don't you do it, et(

Price 35 cents. 
My golden-hair'd darlings, disturb hot their rest, 
Sweet Angels have lull'd them to sleep on my breast; 
O'er their calm slumbers a 
vigil they keep, 
My babes feel no hunger while buried in sleep. 
Whene'er they awake, my fond heart, in its dread, 
Crows sick in the fear that I 
cannot find bread 
To give to my dear ones, so please let them rest; 
While A 
ngels are watching them, slumber is best, 
. - 
CHORUS. 
Tread softly, speak lightly, disturb not their rest, 
While Angels are guarding them, slumber is best. 
Hunger is bitter, while slumber is sweet, 
Wake not my darlings, they've nothing to eat. 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
Lull them to rest! lull them to rest! 
They say there is plenty and peace in the land, 
And that charity gives with a 
lavishing hand; 
Notwithstanding that church spires point to the skies, 
Wealth fattens on plenty, while poverty dies! 
There's one, by whose aid the sparrows are fed, 
And I've prayed unto him for our daily bread; 
I 
feel that I'm going my Saviour to meet, 
Where I'll not see my darlings want something to eat! 
Tread softly, etc.

OUR STAR SPANGLED FLAG or THE 
FREE. 
Written and sung by BL'N' Donal-% 
I'll ring you a 
song of our glorious flag, 
The emblem of sweet liberty, 
The pride of each true-born American heart, 
Our star spangled flag of the free; 
'Tis loved and respected wherever on earth 
Its bright folds in glory may wave. 
For it speaks of Columbia, the lard of the free, 
And the home of the true and the brave. 
CHORUS. 
Then three rousing cheers for our glorious, flag. 
The emblem of sweet liberty; 
'Tis the pride of each true-born American heart, 
Our star spangled flag of the free. 
'Tis but one hundred years since our p,,randsires of old. 
Declared that their sons should be free. 
And no longer ruled with tyrannical power, 
By England's king, over the sea• 
They assembled in Congress on the Fourth of July. 
And each pledged his life to be true. 
'Till the day of his death. his country and friends, 
And our banner, the Bed, White and Blue. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc. 
68 
Each patriot's heart with true joy overflowed, 
When the " old bell " in tones loud and clear, 
Proclaimed to the world that a 
nation was born, 
Which to freemen would ever be dear; 
A 
great shout of gladness leaped forth from each lip, 
When ' twas first learned the deed had been done, 
For they felt that the God of all battles would bless 
The colors of our Washington. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc. 
The nation our forefathers gave us that day, 
Is acknowledged the best now on earth, 
And the poor emigrant. oft with tears in his eyes, 
Will bless the proud day of its birth; 
For he finds in America a 
land free to all, 
A home free from Tyranny's bars, 
Where the poor and oppressed are protected at last, 
'Neatli the folds of the dear stripes and stars. 
Then three rousing cheers, etc.

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW 
Written and sting by BEN DODGE. 
daily am growing depressed and disheartened, 
My griefs and my troubles to you I'll relate; 
Dame Fortune upon nie is certainly frowning, 
The cause of my sadness is my cruel fate. 
The whole of my life is o'ercast with a 
shadow, 
For all kinds of pleasure I 
don't care a 
straw; 
It's simply because, like a 
fool, I 
got married, 
And I've got a 
bad case of a " mother-in-law." 
She comes twice every year to pay us a 
visit, 
And not stretching the truth the least mite, I 
can swear 
That each visit is fully of six months duration, 
And her presence completely tills me with despair. 
When she enters the house then my trouble commences, 
For the whole livelong day she does nothing but jaw; 
How often I've envied onr first father—Adam— 
For he wasn't cursed with a 
mother-in-law. 
Our servant girl, Sarah, is fresh from the country, 
An exceedingly good-natured and pretty young miss, 
One evening, while hugging her down in the kitchen, 
I 
thought I'd endeavor to steal a 
sly kiss. 
Said Sarah, " Your wife would most surely be jealous, 
If she could but see us;" I 
answered, " Oh, slaw 
When the door was burst open, and there stood before us 
That horrid old monster, my mother-in-law. 
The girl was discharged then and I 
soundly rated, 
For I 
couldn't lie out of the matter, of course, 
And my mother-in-law's tongue is constantly running, 
So my wife firmly vows sic will have a 
divorce. 
Now our " Crack Rifle Team" does some mighty fine shooting, 
The result of each match is a'ways a 
draw; 
I'll give any good marksman seven dollars and a 
half 
To take a 
few shots at my mother-in-law,

You could not see her; 
don't dot seem queer? 
Bad luck have I— oh, I 
shall die, 
My vive is so awfully thin. 
Vere I 
first met dis female straw, 
'Dwas at a 
coundry fair. 
She vos valking long mit her mamma, 
Und she had such nice blonde hair; 
I 
spoke to her, she spoke to me, 
Ye got acquainted den, 
Ye married vere, und after dot 
She commenced to grow thin. 
SPOKEN.—She is the thinnest of the thin. 
She used to York 
in an insdrument factory, cleaning out flutes; I 
used to play 
" 
Hide und Seek" mit her, und see used to hide in de gas pipe. 
I 
took her oud riding vonce, und I 
grabbed her instead of de 
whip; I 
never took her oud after dot. 
I 
vos valtzing mit her 
at a 
ball vonce, und de floor manager come up und said, " Young 
man, you vill have to leave your cane in de hat room, it's not 
allowed on de floor! 
I 
told him 'twas no cane, but my vife. 
De oder day vile ye vas oud valking, I 
saw a 
man selling leetle 
red balloons for ten cends; I 
bought vone, und give it to her 
to hold—she vent up, balloon und all; I 
haven't seen her since, 
She is so thin, etc.

I 
HOPE I 
DON'T INTRUDE. 
Written by W, H. DELEnA_NTY. 
Performed by DELEHANTY 
lik_INWAL, 
I'm as happy as the day is long, 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude. 
For love it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy; 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude, 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dear, don't you wish that you was me, ,...rer..1 
I 
led just as happy as a 
big bumble- bee, (5.j/it.) 
I 
was walking by her door, 
When I 
heard the music sweet, 
And my heart with joy filled OV6t, 
I couldn't keep my feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
For it makes me feel so good; 
And if, perchance, I 
sing or dance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
(
Dance.) 
At a 
fancy ball the other night, 
Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We felt so awful good. 
Oh, Daisy looked so fair and bright, 
Sin, set the men all crazy; 
And if they asked her tor to dance, 
Sho'd ask me 1: she could, 
And then I'd st,y ir. 
carelr.s2 way—

REMEMBER YOU HAVE CHILDREN or 
YOUR OWN 
An original song by FRANK LEWIS. 
Sung at the Olympic 
Theatre, N. Y. 
Music published by E. H. HARDLNG, 229 Bower:. 
Price 35 
cents. 
Copyright secured. 
In your path through life each day, you will meet upon the 
way, 
Fellow mortals upon whom this world doth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or by circumstances crushed and striken down ; 
Young men with blighted names, who once had noble aims, 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save, from a dark, dishonored 
grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone; 
You linow not what's in store, for the loved ones you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own, 
The shop girls on the street, with as much respect should meet, 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny hand, 
They too have hearts and feelings — yes, and souls; 
Their family is as dear to them as any here, 
Though their clothes may be all ragged, torn and old, 
.47 
59 
Dejected and forlorn, yet, still their hearts are warm, 
'I hough they lack the rich man's cheerful home and gold. 
They are all to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak a 
gentle word in soothing tone; 
You know not what's in store, for those whom you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor, whom perhaps grill want 
may lure, 
To steal the bread thcir starving children crave, 
Be not the one to blame, you yourself would do the same, 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once 
you, 
Respected and beloved by one and all, 
Who no doubt through care and strife, or some sorrow of thei: 
life, 
Have fallen, but not quite beyond recall. 
And the poor outcast forlorn, don't pass them by with scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone; 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of sin and shame, 
Remember you have children of your own.

DOWN BY THE MILL. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by EDDIE 
Sung with great success by EVA BENNETT. 
At night, when the shadows are falling, 
On the meadow, the vale and the stream, 
And the nightingale softly is calling, 
And nature's preparing to dream ; 
Then, darling, remember your promise, 
I'll wait for you down by the mill, 
1.11 watch for your coming, so hasten, 
When the moon rises over the hill. 
. CHORUS. 
To-night, when the shadows are falling, 
I'll wait for you down by the mill; 
I'll watch tor your coming, so hasten, 
When the moon rises over the hill. 
To- night, when the whippoorwill's calling, 
I 
have something to whisper to you, 
'Tis a 
secret I 
long to impart, love, 
I 
promise each word shall be true; 
I'll kiss you to keep it a 
secret, 
And, darling. I'm sure that you will, 
It only concerns you and I, love, 
So hasten down to the mill.

and K for Knave, and numbers 1. 3. to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many o

The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the direct,ons have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-

Courting Ca rds.—This Series of Cards has been arranged

want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diftl. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
remit. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, manylives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every-
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
