"LARDY DAH! LARDY DAH!" 
As sung by JOHNSON & POWERS. 
Written by J. 
JOHNSON, and sung 
with terrible success at the SAN FRANCISCO M INSTRELS. 
Let me introduce this gawk, lardy dab, lardy dah, 
A gawk can scarcely talk, lardy dah; 
A lunch-counter he will eat, 
lie's a 
terror to every street, 
And he was never known to treat, lardy dab, 
And at election he'll repeat lardy dah. 
CIIOR CS : 
For he wears a 
barrel of flour in his coat, lardy dab, 
And an old striped stocking round his throat, lardy dah, 
In his mouth a 
big segar, and his hands are smeared with 
tar, 
And he drives a 
gay horse-car, lardy dab, lardy dab, 
And he pockets all the fare, lardy dah. 
He is something of a 
spooney, lardy dah, lardy dah, 
The girls all say he's looney, lardy dah ; 
With his side- hair so fine, oh, don't he cut a 
shine, 
And he's yelling all the time, lardy dah, lardy dah, 
But I've got him on a 
line, oh, lardy dah. 
His shirt is very tricky, lardy dab, lardy dah, 
It's a 
pair of cuffs and dicky, lardy dab; 
his shoes are all broke out, his best clothes are up*the 
spout, 
Now just listen to him shout, lardy dah, lardy dah, 
he'll never die with gout. oh, lardy dah. 
Last Night I 
was Dreaming of You. 
As sung by M R. STANLEY GREY with treinendotts success, at th.• 
SAN FRANCISCO MINSTRELS. 
Last night I 
was dreaming of you, 
And bright happy moments gone by, 
We trod the old paths that we knew, 
Ere absence had caused us to sigh. 
Kind friends and companions were near, 
A merry and mirth-loving throng, 
With links of relationship dear, 
To bind us life's pathway along. 
I 
saw the sweet smile that you wore, 
As we gazed on the friends that we knew, 
I 
heard the same voice as of yore, 
That told of a 
bosom so true. 
And long did that pleasure remain, 
And joyous each spirit did seem 
Oh vision return once again, 
Or quickly fulfilled be the dream, 
5 
ONLY A 
FACE AT THE WINDOW. 
As sung by W . 
H HAMILTON, the Premier Baritone, at the SAN FRAN-
CISCO MINSTRELS 
Only a 
face at the window, 
Only a 
face, nothing more; 
Yet the look in the eyes as they meet mine, 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er. 
Only a 
word of greeting, 
Only a 
word, that was all; 
Yet all day in my heart it echo'd 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a 
smile as I 
passed; 
Yet that smile will still be remembered 
As long as my life shall last. 
Only a 
woman, you tell me, 
Only a 
woman to thee; 
Yet there's naught that this wide 
Half 69 dear as this woman to me,

UNCLE TOM'S LAMENT. 
As sung by JAMES Jonssos in the sketch. " Sunny South, - at SAN 
FRANCISCO MINSTRELS. 
You will miss me, darling Chloe, when I 
sleep beneath the 
sod, 
When the Summer winds are murmuring o'er the lea; 
Yow will think of me in kindness as life's weary road you 
plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain and sorrows free. 
For the sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the 
tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay; 
in the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I 
am laid away. 
Cuottus: 
For old Uncle Tom is feeble and old age has bent him low, 
Old master calls, he can no longer stay; 
his limbs are getting weary and his eyes are growing dim, 
But you'll miss me, Chloe, when I 
am laid away. 
You must tell our little children that their father dwells 
above, 
With the angels now he walks the golden staif; 
You must tell them how I 
kissed them with a 
fond and 
6acred love, 
They must try and meet their poor old father there. 
And when the Judge his trumpet sounds from realms of 
bliss on high, 
And the morning of the great day comes at last, 
I 
will meet you, darling Chloe, and to:ether you and I 
Will no longer dread December's Wint'ry blast. 
(Chorus). 
' 
THE VILLAIN STILL PURSUED HER 
As sung by GEO. THATCHER with great success. 
The greatest hit of 
the day. 
My song is of a 
beauty, 
She's a 
Chinese washer and fluter, 
She had money much, 
And her dal v.-as Dutch, 
Du: t:.e villain 
till pur..ued her. 
On one stormy moonlight evening, 
For to meet her humble suitor, 
She :lipped on a 
pie, 
nun the crust in her eye, 
But the villain still pursued her. 
Oh, no'- .-ny story's ended, 
She married a 
French horn tooter; 
And she died very dead 
With a 
cold in her head, 
And the villain still pursued her. 
OH! I'M SO GLAD. 
AS 
Sung by CHARLES BACK US and POSEY 31001tr. 
Oh, I'm so glad, thinking of them good old days; 
I 
feel so glad to think of them days once more; 
Oh, I'm so glad to think of my good old sunny home, 
Away down dar on de ole Ohio shore. 
CHORT2'S: 
Den eh, eh, I 
feel so glad, 
Oh, yes, I 
feel so glad; 
Oh, my, I 
feel so glad, 
When I 
think of my good ole home. 
Oh, carry me back, I 
ain't got time to tarry long, 
Aid me, aid me, and don't be so slow; 
Oh, send me dar, mil me cross the briny waters. 
011. carry me home, for it's dar I 
want to go. 
(Chorus). 
Oh. I'll be glad when I 
hear dem children singing, 
All so glad when I 
get home; 
Ole Ann Eliza, Lucinda, Lib, 
And Aunt Jemima they'll be glad that I 
have come. 
(Chorus). 
[Burlesque Poem.] 
As delivered by PAT ROONEY, the peoples' favorite, with rounds of 
applause. 
The theatre was full, and so was the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
bare-footed slack wire clog, 
For he was the pompey round here. 
The bar-room was perfectly crowded with beats, 
Who waited a 
pleasant surprise; [ out. 
For they knew they would eat when the lunch was set 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose and so did the people, 
Who commenced for to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
And they gave him the laugh and" Yah, yahr 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure; 
"lies away off his base," says old Joe Jewell, 
Who never went back on the poor. 
A brick 
yes, it was! I 
saw Dorkins start, 
And carom on the dark-red for two; 
And it made me feel thirsty to see how he worked, 
And continually dropping his cue. 
He says: " I'm a 
king!" when a 
woman jumped up 
And says: " You lie, you are one of the gang!" 
It knocked Dorkins cold, he owed her for washing, 
And his head on his breast he did hang. 
At length to the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
'' If I 
have not drank enough Bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer; 
When O'Leary and I 
walked a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish ould ' Sam Sandford' was here. 
You insult me to-night, and say I 
am sober, 
Let Tony Pastor play Hamlet alone; 
I'll tell you the reason, I 
know ycu won't laugh, 
I've a 
mother-in-law dead drunk at home." 
As sung by CHAS. BACKUS with wonderful success, at the SAN 
FRANCISCO M INSTRELS.

And tell you every word I

Mary's heard the news.

HAVE YOU SEEN SARAH. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. Music by W. S. M ULLALY, and sung by TONY 
PASTOR With immense success. 
Also JAMES C. 
JOHNSON, Comedian. 
Sensations scarcely pass away, 
When new ones are at hand— 
The latest is imported now, 
From France to Yankee Land; 
With serenades and banquets too, 
Receptions every day, 
A fortune we must own indeed, 
To see Miss Sarah play. 
Cuoitus.—Have you seen Sarah, ain't she a 
tearer, 
None could be fairer than thin Sarah I3., 
Froggies and poodles, claret and noodles, 
And a 
lot of filzpoodles a 
piffle vous oui. 
One evening at the Albemarle, 
I 
sought an interview, 
I 
saw her in the corridor, 
And to her side I 
flew; 
Upon mrknees I 
spoke of love, 
And all my railroad shares, 
She raised her foot to my coat-tails, 
And kicked me down the, stairs. (Chorus). 
Her picture gallery is immense, 
At least so I 
have heard— 
She eats a 
peck at every gulp, 
ust like a 
little bird; 
A 
sculptor too, she claims to be, 
But tell you this I 
must, 
When chisling out a 
marble bead, 
She's always on a 
Bust. 
She's lots of chromo's rich and rare, 
Which she'll expose to you; 
'Twill cost you forty dollars, 
To obtain a 
single view; 
In fact she is so very thin, . 
Before .she leaves us yet, 
We'll use her for a 
piece of reed, 
On a 
yellow clarionet. 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus).

UNCLE ABE AND SISTER RUTH. 
Composed and Sung by JOHNSON tK: POWERS. 
Lend us your attention, 
And we're sure you'll easily guess, 
That we're a 
pair of Quakers. 
You can tell it by our dress; 
We're very sanctimonious, 
Never struggling with the truth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth. 
CHORUS: 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
Then oh! my! we feel delicious, 
And dancing's our delight. 
We never let the congregation, 
Know we dance and sing; 
They'd elevate their eyes and say, 
It's not the proper thing. 
We steal away to visit you, 
And please you 'tis the truth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth. 
We're going back to Quakertown, 
We'll take the early train; 
And when the watermelon's ripe, 
We'll visit you again. 
So keep us in your memory, 
This maiden and this youth, 
Uncle Abe and sister Ruth. 
2is performed by JOHNSON S.: POWERS, of the SAN FRANCISCO MIN. 
sTELs, with great success. 
We're full of joy and glee to-day, 
And as frisky as a 
mule; 
We heard the bell—now don't you tell— 
We ran away from school. 
Our A B 
C's we know with ease, 
And c-a-t 
spells cat; 
We are so stout we waddle about, 
And we're taking Anti-Fat. 
Cnouus: 
We float around like big balloons, 
But yet we never will complain; 
-Wellance and sing, and then we swing 
All day in the shady lane. 
The neighbors all do loudly bawl 
When we climb their fences no matter how tall; 
And down the apples and peaches do fall,' 
When into their orchards we make a 
call. 
We never study so very hard, 
For a 
dunce we'd rather be; 
And on a 
stool we stand in school— 
No books for him and me. 
We are too fat to learn to spell, 
We never will be wise; 
We 
sit all day in the sun and play 
At baking and making mud pies. 
As performed by JOHNSON & POWERS. 
" Original." 
The moon was up and the river did shine, 
We all started off for to have a 
good time; 
We sent for the girls and they all did agree 
To dance till the morning and have a 
good spree. 
First came Lize, and then came Sal, 
Hanging on the arm of big- foot Hal; 
They started up 
th e f
iddle 
and figures did call, 
In a 
grand double- shuffle at the fiat- boat ball. 
CHo ItL's: 
Then its oh, my! let me die, 
While I 
hear the music sweet; 
Oh, dear! can't you hear 
The sound of dancing feet. 
[Repeat. 
We danced so long the niggers did shake, 
Some hollered slipper and they all made a 
break; 
They jumped on the table like a 
lot of loose fleas, 
And the yellow gals sat on the colored men's knees. 
They eat hog meat till they couldn't eat more, 
The boat got a 
sinking, then we shoved her ashore; 
Big Liza fainted and in the water did fall, 
And she floated on her bustle at the flat- boat ball. 
(Chorus). 
We all walked home as the sun did rise, 
Some got sleepy and they shut their eyes; 
We led them along like a 
lot of lost sheep, 
And sang 'cm a 
song that rocked 'em to sleep. 
But old Bill Carter and young Sam Glim, 
They got in a 
muss and the fight did begin; 
They pulled out razors and on the ground did fall, 
Oh, they carved each other at the flat-boat ball. 
(Chorus). 
Banjo solo by J. JOHNSON for E. 31. IIALL of Carncross' Minstrels 
with grsat success. 
Kind friends if you will wait, a 
story I'll relate, 
About a 
girl who is in love with me, 
She's as lovely as a 
lamb, but her head looks like a 
ham, 
Which has been boiled for one month and a 
day; 
And such a 
funny name would make a 
cat walk lame, 
To repeat it now for you I'm going to try; 
So listen without fear, and open wide your ears, 
For to lose this name would cause you all to cry. 
Cnont.t: 
Oh, Philopena, Concertina, Algerina, Clementina, 
111aritina, Flamitina, and sweet -
Matilda Jane; 
Josephina, Seraphina, Hannah Melina, Belvidina, 
Nota Bena, Big Casina, is my gal's name. 
Her form indeed is fine, from ridiculous to sublime, 
She's double-jointed in the heel and nose; 
Her appetite is grand, she ate up an apple stand, 
She's pigeoned and cross-eyed in both her toes. 
But it's to her name she charges all the blame, 
To change it now it worries her night and day; 
But a 
change to mine, I 
fear, is a 
thing that's not 40 
near 
To her imaginative powers as they seem. 
(Chorus). 
Now, she's in love, I 
fear, from her toes up to her ear, 
But I 
hope her love for me will soon give out; 
Such a 
name I 
cannot stand, it's the longest in the land, 
So my advice to her is change her route. 
Let her li ve out on the plains, and then she'll get some 
names 
To add to those which she has already got; 
Mine I'll keep myself, it's better for my health, 
For with all those names with Mille would make it 
hot. 
(Chorus) 
" 
End Song." Sung by GEORGE POWERS, 
Oh, I 
came from New Hampshire, 
Across the Green Mountains; 
Where the sheep and the shepherds 
And the nanny goats dwell; 
I 
came here in search of 
A 
lovely young damsel; 
Where she has gone to 
I 
really can't tell. 
Cuottus: 
Yet I 
weep and I 
wander, 
O'er hills and o'er mountains, 
For the loss of my true love, 
Oh, where can she be? 
Her parents they both 
Were highly respectable, 
Her mother milked cows 
On a 
three-legged stool; 
Her father's a 
farmer, 
That grows the green turnip-tops, 
Her sister's a 
dairy-maid, 
Her brother's a 
fool. 
She's a 
beautiful, young creature, 
Yes, fair in every feature; 
Her hair is magenta, 
And she squints with one eye; 
She moves when she's walking, 
She speaks when she's talking; 
And if I 
don't find her soon, 
I'll lay down and die. 
(Chorus). 
(Chorus)„ 
WHEN I'M GONE, 
Written by J. JOHNSON, and performed by JOHNSON & POWERS in 
their original sketch, " Trouble in de Family." 
Now, Hannah, dear, what makes you 
Treat de ole man so? 
For if you doesn't want me here 
Just tell me for to go. 
Not long ago you loved me, 
Den dar was nothing wrong, 
But now you're at me night and day, 
And wish dat I'd begone. 
C }TORUS : 
When I'm gone, I 
will miss you 
When I'm gone, I 
will miss you, 
Dar'll be one sad heart to miss me 
when I'm gone, 
Yes, when you're gone. 
[Repeat. 
Oh, dear Rufus, how it pains me 
To hurt your feelings so; 
I 
didn't mean to do it, 
And I'll never let you go. 
My temper it was hasty, 
And you staid from home so long, 
But there's one thing I'm certain of— 
I'll miss you when you're gone. ( Chorus). 
I'm sure dey all will miss me 
From dis pleasant home; 
Although it am quite humble, 
What's here is all our own. 
De ehildun dey am growing up, 
To be quite stout and strong; 
Dey'll take good care of Hannah, 
But dey'll miss me when I'm gone. (('horus). 
By FRANK DUMONT. 
Sung by JAMES JOHNSON, and performed by JOHNSON & POWERS. 
I 
have raised a 
dozen children, quite proud of them am I. 
And some are influential, and hold positions high; 
Oh, I 
have lovely daughters, that can't be denied, 
They wear their silks and satins and in a 
carriage ride; 
There is Larry, Ted and Owney, with Terrence, Dan and 
Mike, 
All elegant, and scholars, you never saw the like; 
But the youngest is our Patrick, he's worst of all you see, 
For he's traveling with a 
Circus, an Actor man to be. 
CHORUS: 
Our Patrick is an Actor, he wears the finest clothes, 
The ladies all admire him no matter where he goes; 
With diamonds on his shirt-front, a 
lump the size of tnar, 
it's folly to deny it, a 
dandy is our Pat. 
When he's home upon a 
visit, the neighbors far and near, 
Extend an invitation to have cigars and beer; 
I'll cook corn beef and cabbage, to have a 
lovely meal, 
But Patsy doesn't touch it, so dainty does he feel; 
But he'll eat. ice cream and peaches, Blanc Mange and 
custard pie, 
It's the style he learnt from Actors, they're always living 
high; 
But in spite of all his manners, a 
word for him we'll speak 
lie ne'er forgets his parents with money every week. 
NORTH CAROLINA ROSE. 
Written by J. JOHNSON and performed by JOHNSON and PowEas 
with SAN FRANCISCO M INSTRELS. 
Yonder is the home of the North Carolina rose, 
You can bet she's the darling of my heart; 
love to hear her feet when me she comes to meet, 
In her alpaca gingham dress so smart; 
Her oval black eyes go through me like a 
lance, 
Her little laugh is merry and so clear; 
She'll join me in a 
second, you'll say that right I've 
reckoned, 
I 
can tell by the burning of my ear. 
Cuottus: 
My Rose, (Sym.) My Rose, (Sym.), 
You'll say she's the sweetest flower that blows; 
Oh how my heart does beat for my 
darling little sweet; 
My handsome little North Carolina Rose.

And the first thing I

Who stole my heart away and made my life so gay, 
As the dew drops that sparkle in the sun. 
She.—He's as straigbtas apine, oh, how his eyes do shine, 
When walking out wid him I 
often goes; 
For him I'd leave my mother, and never wed another 
For he calls me his North Carolina rose.

As sung by Mr. 1lLLY Ihnert for two years with tremendous success 
Give my top and string to brother, 
Mamma, when I'm dead; 
When the sexton puts me under, 
in my little bed; 
If the job is like to throw him, 
When the string he jerks; 
Get some little boy to show him, 
how the ohl thing works. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Give my chewing-gum to sister, 
I 
don't want it more; 
On my gums it raised a

In the clouds I'll raise a

In the sweet bye-and-bye.

Causing all my rips;

ripe tomato, 
You know how it is yourself.

Sheepshead, lobster and gin; 
Drown me in a 
watermelon, 
Then wipe off my chin. 
Repeat last two lines 
Let me bruise my little brother, 
Once before I 
go; 
Let me hit him on the smeller,

Let me bust his new suspenders, 
Then pull down his vest.

As sung by JAMES JOHNSON. 
An adventure I'll relate to you, 
That happened the other day; 
As at the depot, in the ears, 
By chance I 
took my way; 
:
,Cfl FCC had set down in my seat, 
' 
Mong daughters, sons and ma's, 
When the door opened to admit 
A lady in the car. 
She quickly glided to her seat, 
A 
smile was on her face; 
The whistle blew, it was all aboard, 
We started from the place; 
Do what I 
would, look where I 
could, 
From daughters to their ma's; 
1 
couldn't take my eyes from off 
The lady in the cars. 
We rode along, kept passing by, 
Each station, one by one; 
When she put her hand up to the blind, 
To keep away the sun; 
I 
volunteered at once to serve, 
And thanked my lucky stars; 
It gave me a 
chance to sit and talk, 
With the lady in the cars. 
• 
THE LADY IN THE CAR—CosynNuED. 
was dressed all in my best, 
In the fashion of the time; 
But for style I 
wore upon ni3 face, 
A moustache that was not mine; 
I 
bought it at a 
barber's store, 
To imitate my pa; 
I 
found at once that it had won, 
The lady in the car. 
Now, as we talked, I 
really felt, 
As if n 
heavenly bliss; 
And found the idea in my head, 
To steal a 
friendly kiss; 
We neared a 
tunnel, brave I 
sat, 
Like any son of Mars; 
As darkness closed around, I 
kissed 
The lady in the cars. 
When from the tunnel we emerged, 
Right into broad daylight; 
Oh, heavens! will I 
e'er forget, 
The thing that met my sight; 
The car was full, the passengers 
Gave vent to loud ha, ha's; 
For my moustache was sticking fast 
To the lady in the cars.

I've got a 
healthy darling 
Who weighs 300 pounds, 
She takes the cake at a 
fat clam bake 
When she goes waltzing round; 
Her appetite is numerous, 
Her mouth is large, of course, 
She's death on clams and western hams, 
You bet she is the boss. 
She's witty, and pretty, 
As a 
wild-cat or giraffe, 
No, never, hardly ever, 
Will you hear this darling laugh; 
With freckled feet and voice so sweet 
As the solid rye and rock, 
She is the belle, her ears do swell

IIEALTHY DARLING . —CONTINUED. 
No wonder she's so healthy, 
Because 
she's so well fed, 
She's the envy of our neighborhood 
With her great big bull frog head, 
She's handy with a 
boxing-glove, 
An oyster stew or pie, 
With a 
base-ball bat she killed a 
rat 
A " Coining thro' the Rye ;" 
How alarming, yet so charming, 
Does her hair flow to the breeze, 
In the polka or mazourka 
She can do with perfect ease. 
She's my sugar plum, my ruin and gum, 
As solid as a 
rock; 
My rootsey, chootsey, tootsey, wootsey, 
Singing on our block. (Cuoitus). 
At early morn when the birds would sing 
You'll find my Sally there, 
Dancing round the sweet rose bush 
With flowers in her hair; 
The little chippies tootetoot, 
And bounce upon her ear, 
She joins them in their jolly songs 
When she is full of beer. 
She's a 
prancer, and a 
dancer, 
But on singing she'd go broke. 
She struck the key, it was high C, 
I 
thought she was going to choke. 
Her eyelids they've grown faded 
Tossing freckles to the moon; 
The neighborhood's gone crazy 
Listening to this dizzy coon. (Chorus).

DONNELLY AND COOPER, 
Written by Dick Devlin and sung by Devlin and Tracy. 
Come all you true-bred Irishmen, I 
hope you will draw 
near, 
And likewise pay attention to those few lines you hear; 
It's of as true a 
story as ever you did hear, 
It's about Donnelly and Cooper, that fought all on Kildare. 
'Twas on the 3d of June, brave boys this challenge sent 
o'er. 
From Brittania to old Grauna to renew her sons once more; 
To renew her satisfaction, and her credit to recall, 
For they're all in deep distraction since Donnelly con-
quered all. 
Old Grauna read the challenge and received and she 
smiled, 
Saying; " You'd better hasten to Kildare, my well beloved 
child, 
There you will reign victorious, which you often did before. 
And your deeds will shine so gloriously around old Erin's 
shore." 
The challenge was accepted; these heroes did prepare 
To meet brave Captain Kelly on the Curragh of Kildare; 
When these two bully champions were stripped off in the 
ring, 
They both were still determined on each other's blood to 
spill. 
35 
DONNELLY AND COOPER.— Continued. 
From 6 
to 9, parried their time, till Donnelly knocked him 
down, 
Old Grauna smiled : " Well done, my child ; that is ten 
thousand pound!" 
The second round that Cooper fought, he knocked down 
Donnelly, 
Likewise true game was Donnelly, he rose most furiously. 
Right active then was Cooper—he knocked Donnelly 
down again; 
Those Englishmen then gave three cheers, saying. " The 
battle's all in vain." 
Long life to brave Miss Kelly; she's recorded on the plain; 
She boldly stepped into the ring, saying: " Dan, my boy. 
what do you mane? 
"My Irish boy," said she, " my whole estate I 
have bet 
out on you, brave Donnelly." 
Donnelly rose again, and meeting with great might, 
And to stagnate those nobles all, continued to his fight. 
Cooper stood in his own defence; exertion proved in vain, 
fie soon received a 
temple blow that knocked him on the 
plain. 
Now you sons of proud Brittania, your boasting now recall. 
Since Cooper, now, by Donnelly, he met a 
sad downfall, 
Out of eleven rounds gave nine knock-downs and broke 
his jaw-bone; 
"‘Shake hands," said she. "brave Donnelly, the battle's all 
our own,"

GEM OF THE EMERALD ISLE. 
Words and Music by PAT FEENEY, and dedicated and sung by 
JOHN W ALSH, the Great Irish Vocalist, at Harry Miner's 
Theatre, N. 
Y. 
I'll sing now in praise of the gem of old Ireland, 
Whose names are respected by friend and by foe; 
Of the men who proud to acknowledge their sireland, 
Of men who gained fame by words and by blow; 
Their hearts brave and true, never knew any danger, 
As cheerfully they for their country did toil; 
It must be acknowledged by friend and by stranger, 
That they were bright gems from the Enteral Isle. 
First is Brian Borue, the great King whose example 
If followed by Monarchs of this present day; 
A blessing would prove, for his wisdom was ample, 
He knew how to rule in a 
true Kingly way; 
Brave Patrick Sarsfield, exiled from his sireland, 
Exclaimed as he died on a 
foreigner's soil; 
Oh, may heaven grant freedom for old Ireland, 
Then died a 
bright gem of the Emerald Isle. 
If we boast of our gems, surely no one can blame us, 
When we've produced men like those I 
will name; 
Balfe Wallace and Tom Moore who made themselves 
famous, 
With music and poetry they gained their fame; 
There's Sherridan, Goldsmith and Swift, three more 
great men, 
What nation on earth ever equaled their style; 
There's Davitt, Daily and Killen, three more great 
Statesmen, 
All these are bright gems of the Emerald Isle,

I'm not a 
wise man, but yet I'm no fool, 
I'm an American boy strong and hearty, 
I 
never mix up in political rings, 
I

There's the devil to pay in the papers each day, 
And half what you read may be true; 
But why people believe every word that they say,

Why Russia's great Czar was blown from 'its car,

Now there's Mr. Jones, my neighbor next door, 
Of a 
family he has quite a 
number; 
He's Wen married, I 
think about six years or more 
With six babies his life to encumber; 
While there is poor me, who's been wed about three 
And as yet there is nothing to show; 
But why such things should be, is quite funny to 
And I 
can't understand, can you?

Now there's General Grant, our Ex- President,

For every one knows he's a

Who is always dressed up in the fashion; 
Her beautiful form is developed to sight,

The Little Old House on the Rhine.

Air:—" The Old Brown Cot on the Hill." 
Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
remember the days that are now past and gone, 
When a 
child how I 
once loved to play, 
By the side of the mill that stands close by the stream, 
Where for pleasure I 
often would stray. 
But now I've grown old and quite feeble you see, 
And so has my poor Icatharine, 
But I 
sigh when I 
think of my once happy days, 
In that little old house on the Rhine. 
CHORUS. 
It was lonely and cold and in winter ' twas drear, 
For the wind would assail it at times, 
Still there's no place on earth to my memory more dear, 
Than that little old house on the Rhine. 
Now the old school house stands just the same as before, 
With the church and its spires so grand, 
Where fond stories of love to each other we'd tell, 
As together we'd walk hand in hand. 
It was there where the old folks for pleasure would stay, 
And bask ' neath the old shady vine, 
How they'd watch us at play when from school we'd return, 
To that little old house on the Rhine, 
It was lonely, & c. 
They are both dead and gone and they sleep side by side. 
In the grave by the end of the vale. 
Where the birds sweetly sing on a 
bright summer's eve, 
And play in the moonlight so pale. 
Good-bye dear old home, fare you well for awhile, 
You've sheltered me many a 
time, 
Oh! I'd love to return to my old fatherland, 
And that little old house on the Rhine. 
It was lonely, Szc.

Published by permission of GEO. MOLINEUX, Brooklyn. 
Oh, way down in South Carolina, 
Where the cotton and the sugar cane grow, 
It is funny 'mong the honey, 
For to see the niggers laugh and crow! 
We'll get up early in de morning, 
And to work we singing all do go, 
Always singing, voices ' nging, 
I 
tell you we're not slow. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, we do have our fun, on a 
holiday we feel so gay; 
And this is what we do: (Break.) 
And den wt, 
play upon de banjo, de bones and tambourine, 
In the morning or the evening, while dancing on the green. 
Ev'ry month we do have a 
party, 
Where the niggers and their ladies all go; 
Aunt Jemima, from Car'lina, 
Comes along with funny old Jim Crow! 
Dar's ole Josephus orange blossom, 
With his sweet gal Ann Eliza Jane, 
Sister Mary, so contrary, 
Had dancing on the brain. 
Oh, we do have our fun, &T.

On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you. 
CHORUS. • 
For on a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A 
charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, 
How 
you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, &c. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L-O-V-E.

bright summer, &e.

I'se longing for the good ole times we used to hab of yore 
When we labored in de cotton and de corn, 
And eb'ry night de darkies gather'd ' round de cabin door 
To de calling ob de mellow bugle horn; 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring. 
De ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true.

While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
Our ole mosso used to like de fun and laugh'd to see de reels 
Dat the boys and girls were always sure to dance, 
And when the " picaninny nigs" would turn upon dar heels 
De ole man would join dem in dar merry prance; 
Tho' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows, 
He was kind to us when daily toil was o'er, 
And eb'ry one dat worked upon the old plantation knows 
His heart was bigger dan our sunny shore. 
(Charus). 
We have heard he joined de army after sending us away 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee, 
And some one else has told us dat dey heard ole missus say 
lie was sleeping ' neath de ole Palmetto*tree; 
If de last report is so, all of us would gladly go 
And shed upon his grave a 
friendly tear, 
For eber since we left him we have felt the keenest woe, 
Dar's nothing for de worn out darkey here.

YOUTH has gone forever, my darling, 
With its brilliant, sparkling zest; 
And the days are fast approaching 
When our dearest joy is rest. 
We have tasted many pleasures, 
And their fragrance lingers yet, 
But I 
mark amid your tresses 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
CHORUS. 
You have worn when life was brightest 
Roses in your dark hair set; 
Wear with equal grace, my darling, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn when life was brightest 
Roses in your dark hair set; 
Wear with equal grace, my darling, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
We have lived and life was pleasant; 
We have laughed, our mirth was gay; 
We have sung and danced and flirted 
As our youth fled fast away. 
But the dance must end, my darling, 
Let it pass without regret; 
Time has placed his hand upon us, 
Snowy strands among the jet. 
You have worn, etc. 
Let us not for joys departed 
Grieve our souls with mournful thought; 
Truer pleasures are before us, 
If with patient faith they're sought. 
Let us win a 
happy future, 
Nor for past enjoyment fret; 
Let us wear a 
crown of honor, 
snowy strands among the jet.

Softly the sunlight is dying,

Faintly the star light of heaven 
Shines o'er the cot in the lea, 
Where in the hush of the even 
Some one is waiting for me.

Some one is waiting for me 
Close by the cot in the lea, 
In the sweet hour of twilight 
Some one is waiting for me. 
Ever sweet memory lingers 
Round that elysian of earth, 
Fair sunny face, dimpled fingers, 
Loved since the day of their birth, 
Gladly my footsteps will wander 
To that bright spot on the lea, 
Where in her beauty o'er yonder, 
Some one is waiting for me.

Someone's watching at the window, 
Where the people hurry by, 
Listening for a 
well-known footstep, 
With a 
bright and eager eye. 
For they cherish still a 
promise 
Of a 
heart they know is true, 
Who has whispered, love, to-morrow, 
I 
will come again to you. 
CHORUS. 
Someone's watching at the window, 
With their face,against the pane; 
Someone's softly, sweetly saying, 
"Will he, will he come again ?" 
• 
Someone's growing very weary, 
As the moments come and go; 
Where the wayward one is wandering 
They would dearly like to know. 
Surely he cal never linger 
From my side so long and late, 
When he knows the sweetest welcome, 
Here, his coming doth await. 
Someone's:watelling, etc. 
Someone's dreaming of the story, 
Ever new and ever old, 
That they long to hear repeated, 
Though it often has been told, 
They are from the past recalling, 
All their many dreams of bliss, 
Hearing not the footsteps falling, 
'Till they are startled with a 
kiss. 
Someone's watching, etc. 
THE DARKY SWELL. 
Written and sung with great success by T.ESTER & ALLEN 
I 
once heard tell of a 
nice young man 
his name was Sammy Greens; 
He used to work in a 
Drug store, 
Painting pork and beans; 
He was so awful stylish, 
You ought to see him flirt; 
His neck- tie was a 
bed- quilt, 
And he had a 
pillow- case for a 
shirt. 
He'd stand upon the corner, 
With a 
tooth- pick in his mouth; 
He'd put you in mind of a 
dizzy swell, 
A darky from the South; 
His salary, seven dollars a 
year, 
He wore a 
red straw hat; 
He used to sleep on the roof of the river, 
To catch wind to try and get fat. 
It would break your heart to see him mash, 
He talked to every wench; 
He said his father was a 
tailor, 
And his mother was French; 
He died last week his mustache, 
And then went and sold his hair; 
To take a 
colored gal named Snow, 
Down to the Irish fair. 
LARDY DAR.

Farewell. 
The last tie is severed that bound me to tlute, 
The struggle is over, and now I 
am free ; 
1 
have loved thee so fondly no language could tett 
So proudly and coldly I 
bid thee " Farewell." 
The conflict is over. I've conquered at last, 
No longer in sadness I 
muse on the past; 
To my joy I 
have conquered, the conflict is o'er, 
So proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
You may go and be happy—ne'er think of the past, 
You have slighted a 
love that could love to the last; 
You may now pass me by with that cold smile of yore, 
But proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
I 
bid thee forget me, wherever thou art, 
Though thoughts of my first love may cling to my heart, 
When friends shall prove false, and fortune decline, 
Thou wilt sigh for the love that no longer is thine. 
WHEN you see a 
young couple late at night on the lake 
bank, chewing, biting, and eating each other, just let 'em 
alone. 
They are only fooling, 
A HUSBAND got angry with his wife and locked her up. 
At dinner time, to mortify her, he sent her a 
bone by his son. 
The little fellow knocked at the door, saying: " Mother, 
father says here is a 
bone for you to pick." " Tell him he's 
not your father, and there's a 
bone for him to pick."

Since the dark river of Death we have crossed; 
Wili not the unbidden tears sometimes start,

Here, in our prison of silence and gloom; 
Still we number our life's Sunny neon; 
When you have laid us to rest in the tomb, 
Ave we forgotten, forgotten so soon? 
CHORUS. 
When the grave receives its trust— 
Earth to earth, and dust to dust— 
Are we at once from your -.memory torn— 
Are we forgotten so soon when we're gone? 
Think how we cherished and loved you on earth, 
Watched o'er your footsteps with tenderest care; 
Wept in your sorrow, rejoiced in your mirth— 
Welcome no pleasure which you did not share. 
Give us, again, our lost place in your heart; 
Keep the sweet chords of affection in tune, 
When for the realms of shadows we part; 
Ate we forgotten, forgotten so soon? 
CHORUS. 
When the last fond tie is broken— 
When the last farewell is spoken— 
Are we at once from your memory torn; 
Are we forgotten, forgotten so soon?

And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I

IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by alt 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called 
IIIISIFTY Dulryry,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear 
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A. little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make any-body at home in the hand-
hug of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
