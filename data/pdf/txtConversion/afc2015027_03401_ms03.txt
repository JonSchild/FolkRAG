Interview Log:  Nubia ________, housecleaning day laborer and activist, interviews 
Lizet ________, housecleaning day laborer and activist.  Interview done in Spanish, 
translated by ________; transcribed by ________. 
00:00:13   Lizet ________ introduces herself. She comes from Guatemala and has three 
children, two here and one in Guatemala. She lives in Brooklyn. 
00:00:55   Nubia asks how she got started in her work. Lizet explains difference between 
day labor and domestic work. She has been a day laborer for five years for many 
different employers in different homes. 
00:02:07   Lizet describes the day labor stop and the ethnic/racial mix of women there 
and the routine/how employers behave, kinds of conversations she has with fellow 
workers standing there. 
00:04:55   L describes her responsibility to get to the job. 
00:05:42   Good day is a full day of work; bad day is waiting a whole day and not getting 
any work, having to pay her own babysitter, that’s the worst. 
00:06:24   Women at the stop: about 100 women daily, competition between them 
sometimes based on who gets picked. 
00:07:35   L comments that she needs to teach others, give testimony, educate herself 
more—this is the skill she needs. Again, describes differences between day labor and 
domestic work where income is more steady. 
00:08:48   L identifies her specialty skills as being a mother and cleaning, provides 
examples of how to get children to eat vegetables. 
00:09:51   Her time is not respected on the job—employers’ holidays are respected but 
hers are not recognized. 
00:10:34   How immigration status and language barriers can lead to exploitation; 
discrimination of various kinds (religious, status of the work itself, inability to speak 
English. 
00:12:15   Feeling fear upon arriving at the job. Fear about male employer’s gaze, fear 
about what the environment will be like, fear of going there alone.  Risk of being 
abused. 
00:13:55  Describes the benefits as minimal. The work may help her break even, to pay

her own babysitter or have money for food—that’s it.  Does not share cultural traditions 
on the job, perhaps once related to food but decided against this—attempts at food 
sharing/friendship not worth it. 
00:16:11  Since joining Workers’ Justice Project she is better organized personally, on 
family and professional level.  She works at Worker’s Justice Project’s Apple Eco-
Cleaning Co-op but doesn’t feel like part of the domestic worker community as she is 
still a day laborer. How she got involved with the Workers’ Justice Program—recruited 
at the day labor stop 3 or 4 years ago. Feels the Domestic Worker’s Bill of Rights doesn’t 
affect her at a day laborer, she is more invisible.  Describes rights she would to see: 
respect, fair salaries, right to get educated, right to join the Justice Program. 
00:20:08  Why Workers’ Justice Program are important—they provide language and 
leadership workshops, raise self-esteem, teach use of organic products, and 
more.  Envisions many women getting educated, moving forward, being valued, no 
more wage theft. 
00:21:22  What politicians should know:  we are human beings, deserving respect, fair 
salaries.  We do honest work and hard work. 
00:22:01  Would like to get a better education to educate others to avoid abuse by 
employers.  Other skills the Workers’ Justice Project teaches. 
00:23:16   Additional details about going to the day labor stop, many difficulties 
(expensive to get there, no bathroom, can be very hot or very cold, leaving children 
behind, waiting can often result in no work. Working with the Co-op has been better. In 
summertime employers go to the countryside and jobs become scarce. Countryside 
work is for women who have no children. Pay varies but sometimes even these salaries 
get stolen. 
00:26:40   L’s hopes for the future, ways to move forward. Importance of maintaining 
good health despite work that is hard on the body. Hope that women will escape having 
to do the work someday.  Feelings of depression in past, feeling pain in knees and back, 
demanding employers supply a mop, staying after they did but establishing some of her 
own rules, despite fear. 
00:29:59   Knowledge is key to demanding rights.  She will keep educating herself to 
educate others.  Fear is failure. People need to be educated to appreciate our work, 
value workers as people, and recognize our rights.
