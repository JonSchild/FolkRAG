I came last year. I came to work in tobacco because in Puerto Rico there wasn’t too many construction 
jobs so I decided to find something else to do. I heard about tobacco field and I thought I will give it a 
shot. I mean if I work in construction it must be more or less the same thing. Working in the sun. Hard 
work more or less. So I came and gave it a shot last year so I came last year and I came this year. 
1:12 Last year I was picking the leaves and this year I’m pulling up the trucks with the baskets full of 
leaves. First thing is not to break the leaves. They get very upset if you break the leaves. They are very 
jealous of the leaves. They tell us to be very careful with the leaves. That is the one of the basic things 
that they tell you. It is hard. You sit on the floor and practically crawling on the floor and the dirt until 
you get to a certain height when you can walk and pick the leaves. The first pick you are dragging 
yourself on the floor and it is not very easy. When the weather it is hot under the tents. Typical 
temperature, outside might be 95 but under the tent is maybe 100. The leaves do give you shade but 
you have very little wind or breeze. You got to win the life. You’ve got to get some money.  Got to take 
care of the family.  
3:03 Last year I was picking leaves. This year I decided to take a shot at loading the trucks which is a lot 
harder because you are in constant movement. Lifting the baskets, loading them into the trucks. Baskets 
come to the end of the row. Trucks come in six at a time. Two on one side, two on another or three on 
one and three on the other.  After the sixth truck leaves you have maybe 20 minutes of rest until the 
next six trucks come in. I lost about 30 pounds. 223 to a 194. That is the good part of it. You get a good 
work out out of it.  
4:35 This year they only planted about 300 acres. Last year it was about 500. But thjs year is about 250-
300. I am usually here for 3-4 months. I have been here since May 9th and I leave on about the 31st of 
August. I go back home to Puerto Rico and see what I can do. At least I get some unemployment checks 
that show up until I can find something there.  
5:27 For now I live in the camp and they make our meals. I won’t say it is home food. It is food. But 
you’ve got to eat it anyways. Hopefully when I get back home I won’t gain that weight back.  
6:15 I was born in the Bronx and lived there until I was 20 years old. That is when I went to Puerto Rico 
and took care of my mother. I stayed there for 27 years. I gave it a shot. Worked in construction. It’s not 
bad once you get used to it. Well once we get out at 6:30 the only thing you do is take a shower, eat and 
go to bed. Some of the guys drink but I don’t drink and I don’t smoke. To relieve the stress I gave up 
drinking about a year ago. I read a book. We start at 4:15 so we wake up about 3:30. Twelve hours a 
day. We take a lunch basket and eat in the field. I don’t know if I will be back next year. Last year I said 
no and look where I am! Wait and see what happens. If I don’t find a job in Puerto Rico maybe I will be 
back. 
8:20 We are not here when the planting happens. We take the plants out of the green house and plant 
them. There is a group of guys who do that. Other than that It is pretty cool. It is something different. 
But you are far away from family, kids, and friends. It is not easy It is a little bit of stressful. We don’t’ 
have much to do. No one is really into basketball or soccer. No one is really into physical work.  
9:30 When we first got here it was a little bit slower but now we work seven days. On rain days we stay 
in the cabins. We can’t work and we don’t get paid for that. You get paid for what you punch in. You 
don’t know what the next day is going to be like. We take advantage of the work they give us. It is not 
easy. It is very stressful for a lot of the guys. I just try to keep my mind busy. Try to read a book. 
Sometimes the guys drink but nothing bad. (Charlie speaks both English and Spanish fluently putting him 
in a unique situation.) Sometimes some of the guys ask me to help them out if they want to send money 
back home. The majority don’t speak English so I help them out.
