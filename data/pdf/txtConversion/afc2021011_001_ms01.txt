SPEAKERS
Scott Graebke, Jared Schmidt
Jared Schmidt 00:01
All right. This is Jared Schmidt was Scott Graebke, was I saying your last night right, Scott?
Scott Graebke 00:07
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 00:08
Good. I've never seen your last name written down, and we've lived next to each other for
almost two years now.
Scott Graebke 00:12
[Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 00:13
Today is Thursday, December 16, 2021. Before we proceed, Scott, I just want to make sure I
have your consent to record this interview.
Scott Graebke 00:24
Yes.
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 00:24
Great. And also in attendance, we have your beagles, uh, R2 and Wiley.
Scott Graebke 00:31
Yep.
Jared Schmidt 00:31
How old are they, Scott?
Scott Graebke 00:33
Wiley is five and a half and R2 is, just turned three.
Jared Schmidt 00:37
And their favorite snack is...?
Scott Graebke 00:39
Cheese.
Jared Schmidt 00:43
And that chees is Tillamook brand naturally, right?
Scott Graebke 00:46
Yeah, yeah, they get a lot of cheese. Come on, guys.
Jared Schmidt 00:50
Scott, I was just wondering if you could begin by introducing yourself a little bit, like what year
you were born? Where are you from originally? That kind of...
00:59
Sure. Yeah, my name is Scott Graebke. I was born in 1974. I'm from Seattle, Washington,
originally.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 01:09
Ok. Did you go to school after, or?
Scott Graebke 01:15
Yeah, I went to, after graduating high school I went to University of Washington for about three
years, and I went to Western Washington University for about six months. And I did not
complete my degree, but I was working towards a degree in mechanical engineering.
Jared Schmidt 01:33
Okay. And then what happened after, moved on to Seattle, or?
Scott Graebke 01:38
I lived in Seattle until I was 32, and then I moved to Sequim for two years, and then I moved
back to Seattle.
Jared Schmidt 01:49
Did you say Sequim?
Scott Graebke 01:51
Squim. S-E-Q-U-I-M. It's up in northwestern Washington on the straights of Juan de Fuca.
Jared Schmidt 01:54
Where's that? Okay, what where were you up there?
Scott Graebke 02:01
I worked at a snowboard plant called Mervin Manufacturing.
Jared Schmidt 02:05
That's cool. And then you moved back to Seattle? And then I moved back to Seattle after that.
Yeah.
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 02:10
What were you doing in Seattle, then? I last in Seattle, I last worked at an airplane parts
manufacturer as a contract manufacturer for Boeing. Mostly Boeing, I should say, AbTech Tie-E.
Jared Schmidt 02:28
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 02:29
Wiley, give me that [reaches for something from beagle]. Thank you. And they, they were
located in Everett, Washington. And I did, I was the supervisor of the facilities maintenance and
environmental health and safety up there.
Jared Schmidt 02:42
Okay. And then, uh, when did you move down to Tillamook?
Scott Graebke 02:47
I moved to Tillamook in 2015, right at the end of March.
Jared Schmidt 02:53
Okay. And that was for the job for the creamery or...?
Scott Graebke 02:56
Yeah, yeah, I spent in 2015, I found out that it was possible to live down here. [Jared chuckles] I
used to come here all the time. Right after high school, my friends and I started surfing and we
came down here to go surfing and came down here hundreds of times over many years,
leaving on Friday night after work and, and coming back on Sunday afternoon. Never crossed
my mind it was possible to live here and hadn't surfed in a long time and figured I'm getting
older, what the hell, let's see if I can do it. And so I spent the winter of 2014-2015, looking for
work and found a job at the cheese plant.
Jared Schmidt 03:39
Okay, in manufacturing or...?
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 03:43
In, uh, so in the maintenance department.
Jared Schmidt 03:45
In the maintenance department?
Scott Graebke 03:45
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 03:46
Okay. And so you've worked at the Creamery since 2015?
Scott Graebke 03:50
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 03:50
So you came from the surf and stayed for the cheddar.
Scott Graebke 03:52
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 03:53
[Laughs at own joke] Nice.
Scott Graebke 03:55
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 03:56
And you said your position is maintenance, what is it specifically titled as...?
S
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 04:00
Specifically titled as a maintenance technician.
Jared Schmidt 04:03
Ok.
Scott Graebke 04:03
[Wiley jumps up on Jared's Lap] Wiley, off. Come here. There you go.
Jared Schmidt 04:10
He's just trying to help me with my notes.
Scott Graebke 04:13
Yeah, he's good at, at uh, help [laughs].
Jared Schmidt 04:17
So maintenance technician. So how would you, um, describe your [dog sniffs recorded] position
as a maintenance technician?
Scott Graebke 04:25
So maintenance technician is a support role to manufacturing and, so, we take care of all the
production equipment, not so much the building and grounds there's a separate group of, of
site maintenance technicians that take care of the buildings and grounds.
Jared Schmidt 04:43
Ok.
Scott Graebke 04:43
But we take care of the, everything from the utility systems, all the electrical systems to the
plumbing, and the ammonia refrigeration and potable water and the and the dairy, dairy piping
and the pumps, the tanks, the, the packaging equipment, and forklifts. Anything that's in the,
S
S
S
S
S
that's in the building that isn't on a wall.
Jared Schmidt 05:13
Right?
Scott Graebke 05:14
Or even some of the stuff that is on the wall is ours to make work. R2, get out of there [R2
sniffs into Jared's bag] R2, get out of there.
Jared Schmidt 05:20
He's just trying to figure out, he probably smells my dog.
Scott Graebke 05:22
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 05:24
Okay, so how did you get into this position, exactly? What that was that applied for, or was it
open, or...?
Scott Graebke 05:33
I applied for an open position that...so they had a, an opening for a night shift maintenance
supervisor. And I was wanting to get out of Seattle pretty, pretty strongly and wanting to get
down here. And I thought, you know what, if I work, if I work night shift, I can go surfing every
morning after work if I want to. And so that was that was the thought that was in my head. So I
said, Hey, what the hell do that, and so I came down for a series of interviews. It's probably two
full days worth with a variety of different people and they all said, "And you want to work
nights?" I said, "Yeah. Sounds good to me. I'll just go surf after work." And, and they said, "All
right." So they they brought me on board as a maintenance supervisor, initially, and then I
transitioned to technician and 2019.
Jared Schmidt 06:38
That's cool. So you mostly did night shifts, then?
Scott Graebke 06:41
S
S
S
S
At the beginning, it was night shift. And then I ended up on swing shift for most of the year, and
then on day shift for most of a year. And then I put myself back on night shift, because that's
kind of where I was needed.
Jared Schmidt 06:55
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 06:55
And uh, and then I transitioned to the, to the maintenance crew, and then started a night shift
there. And I'm now on swing shift.
Jared Schmidt 07:05
So back and forth between?
Scott Graebke 07:07
I bounced around. Yeah, I like moving around, scheduled days off. And, and, and actually, you
get to find out which one works best for you.
Jared Schmidt 07:15
Right? What's it like working between the day shift and the night shift? Like, what are the
main...Is there a lot differences between those two, or?
Scott Graebke 07:23
You talking about the people that work for shift or just the work on the shift?
Jared Schmidt 07:26
Both, yeah.
Scott Graebke 07:26
Okay. So the work on the shift is, you know, technically it's the same, but it's really different.
Jared Schmidt 07:35
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 07:35
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 07:37
There are a lot more people in the building on day shift. And so there's, I guess, with people
comes, comes chaos, it's not really chaos, but it's, there's a lot more, a lot more demand for
our services during the day. The the equipment will decide if we're needed, sometimes and,
but, the rest of the time when people say, "Hey, I want this, I want that. Can you come over
here and do this, can you install one of these over here?"
Jared Schmidt 08:10
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 08:11
And day shift is a lot more, a lot faster paced on that front, just because swing shift is kind of
like day shift gets everything going and they, they start packing the cheese, they start making
the cheese. Swing shift is kind of carrying it through to the end of the day before sanitation.
And so, most of the kinks, if there's any kinks, have been worked out by the time sling shift
comes on. So, it's it's a much mellower shift.
Jared Schmidt 08:38
Okay, that's when you prefer is the swing shift is [ILL].
Scott Graebke 08:41
Yeah, not really because it's mellower, it's certainly exciting, like the days go faster on day
shift.
Jared Schmidt 08:49
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 08:50
But the kind of work that, that I end up doing, that I appreciate more, is more project based
than it is breakdown response.
Jared Schmidt 08:58
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 08:58
Okay.
Scott Graebke 09:00
And so, uh, and so I prefer swing shift for that.
Jared Schmidt 09:04
Okay, so what does a normal day look like in your position? Or is there such a thing?
Scott Graebke 09:10
Um, there's a, there's a, quite a wide range. So, I give you a kind of a, a, a normal, non- non-
crazy day is we come in at 1:30 and at clock-in there's a shift transition meeting where we, we
are told what the issues of the day have been by the, by the day shift folks and, and if we're
needed, right then in there we go. You know, go right with the nation person to whatever the,
the issue is, and start working on it. And if we're not needed right then and there, then we get
on the computer and find out what we're supposed to be doing...
Jared Schmidt 09:54
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 09:56
...and try to sneak in to pm or, or get working on a project or, one of the guys on each shift
does the thing called rounds where they, they check the utility systems and make sure that
the, the pressures and flows are, are where they're supposed to be that they're all in spec. So
they do a visual inspection on those, even though they're also electronically monitored. So that
happens, so somebody goes and does rounds, everybody else goes and finds out what they're
going to do, and then they, they just kind of get after it. And then we all wear radio, and we're
listening for calls from the production departments. If they, if they need us, then we go and if
they don't need us, then we, we either work on a project or we, we try to get a pm done or
preventive maintenance tasks on equipment that's not running.
Jared Schmidt 10:54
Okay.
Scott Graebke 10:55
Or rebuild something that, that isn't installed that is going to replace something that's running.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 11:03
Okay.
Scott Graebke 11:04
That's, that's kind of the normal thing. And then the abnormal thing is, if we've got, if we have
breakdowns in the plant. So we have a, we have a system that, a PLC system that monitors
most of our, most of our processes everywhere...
Jared Schmidt 11:26
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 11:26
...are monitored by plant automation. And if one of those goes out of spec, you know, for
instance, the boilers supply steam for the cheesemaker, the whey plant packaging lines, their
steam oozes everywhere. And so, if the boilers go down, that has potential to bring the whole
plant down. So, when that radio goes off, you run out to the boiler house and, either get the
backup boiler back running or, or find out what, why the steam pressure went down and get it
back up.
Jared Schmidt 11:26
Okay.
Scott Graebke 12:04
We've thankfully, we've got enough redundancy in that that, you know, you've got 10 minutes
to figure that out before, before anything bad happens. But, you know, same thing with air
compressors, those could go off or, you know, someone could run into a packaging line with a
forklift and, and then we got to go run out there and
Jared Schmidt 12:22
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 12:23
try to get it back together. That's really rare. But you know, if anything...
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 12:28
A forklift that runs into something you said?
Scott Graebke 12:30
Yeah, there's a lot of forklift traffic in the plant. And, on a rare occasion, someone's going
around the corner, the tail end will swing out and bump, bump something and, and we'll have
to fix that, get it realigned, bang on it with a hammer, weld it back together, straighten it out,
and get it back up and run it again. Or, or even some of the, the automated systems Well, like I
say, everything's got some level of automation on it, and everything gets washed every single
day with a ton of water and, and heat and steam. And the electronics don't really like that. And
sometimes you don't find out that, that a photo wire, or something is going to die until, you
know, 5pm. And suddenly it stops working and the, some function that's going on won't, won't
happen anymore. And we got to go figure out why and then find out that oh, this photo eye is
bad or, and change it out or.
Jared Schmidt 13:08
Hmm. Right.
Scott Graebke 13:34
Or, kind of think of what, and usually, if it's if it's a really crazy day, it's because there's more
than one of those things going on. But, that's kind of few and far between,kind of goes in
waves.
Jared Schmidt 13:48
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 13:49
Like, you'll have a, you'll have a crazy day and then the rest of them will be fairly mellow and,
and then you might have a couple of weeks before you have a, a another hair pulling day or it's
a...You never know. That's kind of one of the fun things about maintenance is that you don't
know what you're gonna do today until, you don't really know what you're gonna do today until
it happens.
Jared Schmidt 14:13
Mkay.
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 14:14
You have all these things that are, you're supposed to do, and things that you have planned,
and sometimes you get to do those and other times the world decides differently and, and, and
you're working on something you've never seen before because it's never broken before. So
now you got to go figure it out.
Jared Schmidt 14:34
How do you adapt to, what you just said? Sometimes you see did you get to work on something
you've never seen before? How do you adapt to that as an individual and as a team?
Scott Graebke 14:43
As a team, we tend to have people who specialize in, in areas like we have at least one person
on every shift that is at least somewhat familiar with the refrigeration system and they're, and
they're tasked with, you know, doing preventive maintenance on the refrigeration system and
those rounds. And so, if they're, if they're not one of the top level refrigeration people, that's
the process they go through to, to learn the system and understand how to operate it. And uh,
and so, there might be one of those, a person there, one person might specialize more in the
dairy processes, pumps and valving for the dairy systems and, you know, I'm more specialized
in, in packaging equipment, or electromechanical stuff, stuff with motors and air cylinders. And
so if, if we've got to break down and there's a, and it's a utilities thing, and our utilities person
goes to it, and they try to get them to take care of it, then. And if they can take care of it, that's
great. If they need help them the rest of us come over and we put our heads together and try
to figure it out.
Jared Schmidt 15:59
Right.
Scott Graebke 16:00
So that's as a team, but as an individual, it's, as you do, as you work in industrial maintenance,
you start, you start seeing familiar things. And what I like to think of it as, everything's just
LEGOs: there's an air cylinder, that's a LEGO, there's a solenoid valve that runs air
cylinder,that's a LEGO, you know, I've seen one-on-one machine, you see one another, they're
virtually, they might look different, but they do the same function, and you start to recognize all
these LEGO pieces that you've built with before.
Jared Schmidt 16:38
Mhm.
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 16:39
And, and, you know, with experience, you start realizing the...Dogs, what are you doing? Hey,
Wiley! So with experience, you start realizing, okay, I've seen that before. I know what that's
doing. I open the electrical cabinet. I know that's the thing that turns on the air cylinder over
there, the air cylinder over there's not working. So...
Jared Schmidt 17:02
He's trying to eat a piece of tape.
Scott Graebke 17:04
[Walks away and addresses Wiley] Hey, can I have that? Thank you. Can I have that? Wiley? I'll
trade you. Thank you. When you get all this stuff? [Returns to seat] Where was I?
Jared Schmidt 17:18
LEGOs, seeing everything as...
Scott Graebke 17:20
LEGOs.
Jared Schmidt 17:21
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 17:21
Yeah, so, you see that, that industrial plants are essentially just made of, made of, you know,
it's nuts and bolts and, and metal and plastic and things that make it move and it's motors and,
and solenoid valves and actuators and photo eyes and you start to, you start to learn what to
what to look for, like, oh, this, this function is not happening. Does the machine know that
there's a thing there that it's supposed to do? So there's going to be an eye. There should be an
eye somewhere that tells the machine that there's a, there's a piece of cheese there that it's
supposed to act on.
Jared Schmidt 18:03
Right.
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 18:04
Is that eye working? And you go, and you go through the steps and, of, say "Oh, the little light
came on." So go see where it's plugged in. "Oh, the little light came on over there. Okay, so it
must know, it's maybe it's something else," and you just keep going down the line. But, but
that's how I like to think of it it's...
Jared Schmidt 18:21
Hmm.
Scott Graebke 18:21
I don't like to, it's more fun when, for me, when I don't know, when I'm not super familiar with a
piece of equipment, because then it's a puzzle. But it's a puzzle with all the same LEGOs, you
know.
Jared Schmidt 18:34
Right. So you, you enjoy that, that, that puzzle aspect, kind of?
Scott Graebke 18:39
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 18:39
Okay.
Scott Graebke 18:40
Yeah, that's, that's what, that's what makes it fun is the, the there's new LEGOs coming out all
the time. And there's, some of the stuff is 30, 40 years old and....R2 get out of there.
Jared Schmidt 18:54
[To R2] It's ok buddy, it's ok.
Scott Graebke 18:55
S
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 18:55
And it's got the old school stuff on it, and then you get a machine that's got all the new stuff on
it. And so you start learning the, learning the new pieces, and it's, and it's fun to, fun to do that
puzzle. And so, there's, there's a lifetime of learning, I should say. It's like no one will ever know
everything they need to know about every piece of that plant. It's
Jared Schmidt 19:18
Right.
Scott Graebke 19:19
way too much for any one person. So...
Jared Schmidt 19:21
Yeah, because you get new pieces all the time, right?
Scott Graebke 19:23
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 19:23
New eqipment....
Scott Graebke 19:24
New pieces, adjusting processes, adapting processes, and we just got a new tank for the
wastewater system that, you know, hopefully I'll never have to learn about that tank but...[To
R2] R2, get out of there. [ILL commotion]
Jared Schmidt 19:46
Okay, so then how do you learn, well, back up question is, um, you said you work at a team and
how many were on the team and how's that work?
Scott Graebke 19:54
Typically on the maintenance crew, there's a minimum of four people on a shift.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 20:01
Okay.
Scott Graebke 20:02
And it's, it's a 24/7 operation. So, there's two sets of swing shift crews. So there's four on my
end of the week and there's four on the other end of the week and on Wednesdays, we cross
over. [To beagles] Guys, we don't need to be banging on anything. [Jared laughs] And same
thing on nightshift. And day shift has a couple more, I think, right now they're, I think day shifts
at six per side, maybe it's five, I'm not sure. But the maintenance crews pretty big. There's,
there's over 30 people involved, including the support staff.
Jared Schmidt 20:42
Okay, that's cool. So then, do you have a lot of communication as a team? Or is it, like, the
same people as a team? Or how do those dynamics as a team work, I guess.
Scott Graebke 20:53
We got a lot of people that are, that have found niches for themselves in different areas. Like,
we're trying to get, more or less, everybody an electrical license work, what that we're not
there. And, and there's some people who really excell at that and want to focus on electrical
work, although we don't get to focus on anything, we all have to take care of the whole plant,
but, we, we try to get...[To beagles] Guys, no. [To Jared} Sorry, I forgot your question.
Jared Schmidt 21:30
Oh, that's fine. Just how the team dynamics....
Scott Graebke 21:32
Oh, team dynamics. Yeah, so, there's a lot of differences. Some people really like, really like to
work with other people and like, I like to work by myself if I can.
Jared Schmidt 21:48
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 21:48
But um, you know, some, some, some crews will, you know, all four of them will go to a break
down and, and some crews will stand back and let one guy do it unless they call for help.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 22:02
Right.
Scott Graebke 22:02
It kind of depends on, on the people there. And, you know, there's pluses and minuses to all of
it. Because the the more things you see, the more and faster you learn.
Jared Schmidt 22:15
Right.
Scott Graebke 22:15
So, so if you're going to all the breakdowns that happen on your shift, you get to see all of
them, you learn a bit more, but at the same time that, you know, less work gets done. So...
Jared Schmidt 22:27
Right. How often do things break down, like, in a shift? Is it like a regular thing, or is it like you
said where it's feast and famine, almost?
Scott Graebke 22:35
It's kind of feast and famine. But there's, it's a rare shift where they, where nobody in the plant
calls for some kind of assistance.
Jared Schmidt 22:43
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 22:45
And it might be, it might be something that, where they call and just say "Hey, um, well, I'm
worried about this, it's making a noise. Can you check it out later?" Or, or it might be you know,
"Hey, I need this photo eye is broken. Can you fix it right now? And we do that...hang on a sec.
Can I pause? [Scott whistles for dogs and takes them downstairs. Interview paused]
Jared Schmidt 23:06
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 23:06
Yeah. [Interview continues] Should be back to back to it. Okay, cool.
Scott Graebke 23:27
Okay. What were you talking about? Does it, how often do we have breakdowns?
Jared Schmidt 23:31
Yeah, what's that? I guess what's that like for you to have those happen? How often do they
happen?
Scott Graebke 23:36
Yeah, they're, like I say, it's a rare day that it doesn't happen. There's usually like, on a good
day, though, there's going to be about three radio calls. And they'll be simple things that, that,
you know, happen all the time like that, in the packaging department, we get overhead jams,
where a piece of cheeses gets in the wrong position.
Jared Schmidt 24:00
What do you do when a piece of cheese happens like that, could you describe that a little bit
more?
Scott Graebke 24:04
Okay, so an overhead jam is a, apiece of cheeses in the wrong position, and the Bagger has a
paddle on it that comes around and, if the cheese in the wrong spot the paddle jams into the
top a piece of cheese instead of pushing it into the bag and then it locks up the Bagger and the
Bagger stops running. And so, we have to go and clear that jam because it, typically ,causes a,
it's not just, you got to pry the piece of cheese out of it, but you've got to put the paddle back
in its track in the, in the piece of equipment. So, that's a common one. Everybody knows how to
react to it.
Jared Schmidt 24:38
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 24:39
But it, you know, it takes five or ten minutes.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 24:41
Ok.
Scott Graebke 24:41
And, and so uh, that's a common one. And then, of course, the next thing is, you know, how do
we make that stop happening?
Jared Schmidt 24:51
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 24:51
And, and so, there's a group of people trying to figure out how to make that kind of thing stop
happening, but...
Jared Schmidt 24:58
Right.
Scott Graebke 24:58
But yeah, you get a radio call for that, and it's "Overhead jamb in packaging." And so, if the
package, the packaging person happens to be at break or something, and then I might go there
or another guy might go there. Typically, there's, there's so much more equipment in
packaging than there is in the rest of the plant, like individual pieces.
Jared Schmidt 25:16
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 25:18
The cheese area has the big stuff, but the packaging area has a lot of different functions. And
so, there's a lot of different pieces of equipment and a lot more opportunity for things to go
wrong.
Jared Schmidt 25:27
That's the room with the octopus in it, right?
S
S
S
S
That's the room with the octopus in it, right?
Scott Graebke 25:30
Yeah, the blue octopus machine is the, the vacuum sealer.
Jared Schmidt 25:34
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 25:34
And so, that's one of the primary, that's the primary piece of equipment in the in the packaging
operation.
Jared Schmidt 25:42
Okay.
Scott Graebke 25:42
Because we're, we're pulling a vacuum on that bag and sealing the piece of cheese with, with
no air in the bag.
Jared Schmidt 25:49
Ok.
Scott Graebke 25:49
And that, that piece of equipment does that job.
Jared Schmidt 25:52
So you got to know how to fix pretty much every single piece of equipment in that section, or at
least someone in your team will?
Scott Graebke 26:00
At least some on our team will, yeah. And it's, and again, it comes back to the LEGOs, because
none of us have seen every problem that can possibly happen.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 26:11
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 26:11
So every once in a while, you get a weird one
Jared Schmidt 26:13
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 26:13
that, either, if that you haven't seen before, or, or that nobody's seen before. And then you got
to get into the troubleshooting mode and figure out okay, what's causing this? How do we, how
do we make it stop?
Jared Schmidt 26:27
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 26:30
So, but typically, yeah, there's...the sorts of things that, that might, really cause a lot of trouble
is, if one of the really high tech pieces, like a servo motor that's programmed by the New
Zealand company that makes the, the debaggers that, that goes out, then it...you need to, you
need a lot of specialists to, or specialty to, to get that fixed. And it might, might mean you're,
you're calling New Zealand for phone support, or we've got a couple of FANUC robots out there
that, that do exactly what they're told extremely well.
Jared Schmidt 26:48
Mhm Mhm.
Scott Graebke 27:19
And if they don't like anything that's happening, they just stop. And, so you got to figure out
what they don't like, they're very sensitive to, to uh, to wear, I guess.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 27:32
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 27:32
You should say they, they're, they're fast, they zip around, they're precise. But if you're, if you
run into one with a piece of cheese, you might break something and it will know that it's broken
and it won't work. And then you got to, you got to get in and get it to figure out how to, how to
start working again,
Jared Schmidt 27:51
Okay.
Scott Graebke 27:51
or, you know, sometimes you got put a new, put a new motor in it. And then you have to tell it
where it is because it's very dependent on knowing where it is in space, because it has to start
at position A, for all of its movements.
Jared Schmidt 28:03
The machine does, right?
Scott Graebke 28:04
The robot does.
Jared Schmidt 28:05
The robot does, okay.
Scott Graebke 28:06
Because if the robot thinks it's in position B, when it's for, thinks it it's in position A when it's
really in position B it can move and then ram itself into into the frame. So, it has to know
exactly where it is at all times. And it won't, it won't run if it doesn't know exactly where it is at
all times. But if, if it somehow forgets, like the batteries die, and you turn it off, and it forgets
where it is, then you've got to get FANUC on the phone and say, "What what do I do about the
robot?" And they'll talk you through the process of telling it where home is, stuff like that.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 28:43
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 28:44
So usually, if it's a really, really bad breakdown, it's gonna be something like that, where, where
the, the level of expertise needed is, is, is highly specialized and sort of thing that, you know,
those things are great. And we bring in a robot specialist every four months to, to do a service
on it and make sure we know, know that it's in good working order. But you know, something
bad happens we might need to, need to get a robot specialist on the phone or fly him out.
Jared Schmidt 29:16
I guess a lot of people probalby wouldn't think that there's robots involved in their cheddar.
Scott Graebke 29:20
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 29:20
[Laughs]
Scott Graebke 29:22
Those are fairly new and we've only had him for, for four years and that's, you know, part of
why we're not in house experts on them, yet that's, we haven't had to be...
Jared Schmidt 29:33
Right.
Scott Graebke 29:33
You know [ha] someday we'll get there.
Jared Schmidt 29:36
Someday be a robotics egineer?
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 29:38
We'll get there. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 29:39
I like it. That's fun. So then, what happens if there's nothing really going on in the shop or in the
creamery, no problems are happening. What do you do?
Scott Graebke 29:51
All of us have a list of preventive maintenance tasks that, that uh, that we're required to do on
a regular basis. So we have weekly PMS, daily PMS, monthlies, quarterlies. And some of those
will be pumping grease into, into bearings on, on a piece of equipment, and some of them will
be replace the belts, replace the rollers, stuff like that.
Jared Schmidt 30:17
Okay.
Scott Graebke 30:17
Check that this actuator is working. We've got a big list of stuff to do, so, we uh, we don't really
have any reason to not be doing something.
Jared Schmidt 30:26
Right. There's no downtime, really?
Scott Graebke 30:29
Not really no.
Jared Schmidt 30:30
Okay.
Scott Graebke 30:31
Yeah.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 30:32
That makes sense.
Scott Graebke 30:33
You can make some for yourself every once in a while, but it's, there's plenty of stuff to do.
Jared Schmidt 30:36
Okay.
Scott Graebke 30:36
Yeah
Jared Schmidt 30:36
Do you, take care of like, special or favorite thing you like to work on at the creamery, a piece
of equipment, or, or job, I guess I should ask?
Scott Graebke 30:51
My favorite thing to do is, is either rebuilds or new builds.
Jared Schmidt 30:59
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 31:01
There, for me, there's some satisfaction in, in taking one piece of equipment completely,
tearing it down, putting new bearings on, making sure all the shafts are good, all the motors
are our tip top. And, and you know, especially when it's going from having sloppy mechanisms
to be in tight and do and it runs better. Now, that's, that can feel good.
Jared Schmidt 31:27
Hmm.
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 31:27
I'm not a huge fan of, of oil changes and pumping grease. I mean, that needs to be done, and I
do it but
Jared Schmidt 31:35
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 31:35
But you don't get the same sense of satisfaction out of doing that, that, well I don't anyway, as I
do from doing a rebuild [One of the beagles sniffs at microphone]...work like it's new again.
That's, that's more interesting. And then, um, I've been working with a couple of other
maintenance techs on designing conveyors lately. And so, I've been getting to spend a lot of
my, a lot of my time building those and that, that is, that's ultimately more fun than the the
maintenance side. But...
Jared Schmidt 32:13
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 32:13
But uh, like I say, it's, when it comes down to LEGOs and you've seen how all these things work.
And then you, you know, you get the you get the Deathstar kit from LEGOs and you can build
the Deathstar like the, like the plan says. But then, afterwards, you tear it apart and you make
your own thing.
Jared Schmidt 32:30
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 32:31
And it's kind of like that.
Jared Schmidt 32:34
I like that way of thinking of it like LEGOs.
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 32:35
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 32:36
That makes a lot of sense.
Scott Graebke 32:37
It makes it makes it fun.
Jared Schmidt 32:38
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 32:39
It's, it's work for a lot of people, and some days, it's work for me, but...
Jared Schmidt 32:43
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 32:43
It's uh, it's great to get to have some fun, too.
Jared Schmidt 32:48
Yeah. Do you have a particular story or two about times when the equipment just completely
derailed and anything happened that you had to go in and fix it or, like...
Scott Graebke 33:01
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 33:01
...almost catastrophic level or...?
S
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 33:03
Yeah, we've got we have one that, uh. That's, uh, when you ask that question, it's one of the
things that goes through my mind is, whenever anyone asked me that question, even in past
jobs, like, you know, "Why are you so frazzled? Why, what's going on?" And it's like, I forgot,
you know, 45 things just happened and I can't remember any of them. [Both laugh] Because
I've just, bang that's done. Next thing, next thing, next thing.
Jared Schmidt 33:28
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 33:34
But um, like for instance, a bad radio call we had, like,a month ago, it was for the ASRS and we
got a radio call, like, [In concerned tone], "Ummmm, can we get an engineer to the ASRS?" And
uh, and so you're like, "Oh God, that doesn't sound good." And so we go out there and, and uh.
So the ASRS is the Automatic Storage and Retrieval System.
Jared Schmidt 34:06
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 34:07
And when you drive past the plant from the road, and there's you see that big white building in
the back that's, that's actually the ASRS it's like 96 feet high, of, I think it's eleven, eleven pallet
layers high, 15,000 pallets of, of cheese.
Jared Schmidt 34:12
Mhm. Oh wow.
Scott Graebke 34:27
And it's got a crane that runs down the middle of it on a, on a single track.
Jared Schmidt 34:32
Mhm.
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 34:33
So it's got this 96-foot-high crane, balancing on a, on a single train track with tracks on the side
riding the racking,
Jared Schmidt 34:41
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 34:42
and it has this little robot tank that it sends out onto the, onto the pallet layers.
Jared Schmidt 34:49
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 34:50
And it has chains on the top and wheels on the bottom so it can drive itself under a pallet, lift it
up off the, off of the, off of the racking. And, and then drive it back onto the elevator and it's
crane, and then bring that pallet to, to a conveyor where it, sends it out for shipping or sends it
out for packaging.
Jared Schmidt 35:11
Wow.
Scott Graebke 35:11
And so, that's, that's where, you know, all our cheese goes into aging. And that's where a lot of
it is aged. The stuff that ages for a long time will go into one of the manual warehouses but,
Jared Schmidt 35:25
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 35:25
but that thing is running pretty much 24/7 as well.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 35:29
The ASRS?
Scott Graebke 35:30
The ASRS is. So we got a call out there to like, "Oh god, come out to the SRS." And so this crane
is moving and it requires power, so it's got to have a mobile power source. So it has a, it has,
we call a bus, it's a fiberglass box with electrical contacts in it and then it has these trolleys
that ride in it,
Jared Schmidt 35:55
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 35:56
that, that have brushes in them that supply the power, you know, not too different than if you
seen the old electric buses,
Jared Schmidt 36:02
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 36:03
in the cities with the, with the bars that go up and ride the, the wires, it's kind of that sort of
thing.
Jared Schmidt 36:08
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 36:10
But we had one of those, we get there and one of the trolleys had twisted itself sideways in the,
in the track. And uh, and so that's, you know, not one that you see, every, I think it might be
the first time it's that, that's actually happened.
Jared Schmidt 36:27
S
S
S
S
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 36:27
And, and so the way it happened is, is, there's actually two trolleys there and they're, so
they're, they're redundant. They're both running the same electricity into the cab of the
elevator, but they're riding in the same trolley and the chain that tugs them along with the,
with the elevators that moves up and down the track broke on one end and so when trolley
crashed into the other one twisted it up in the in the track and broke off a bunch of pieces. And
so, that was a bad day. It was, so we had to, you know, immediately get out there and you, you
lock it out.
Jared Schmidt 37:09
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 37:09
So, lockout-tagout is a safety procedure where you ensure that the piece of equipment won't
move when you approach it, or when you get into it where it's moving parts are. So you go find
the electrical supply to it and throw the switch and then put a padlock on it, and stuff like that.
Jared Schmidt 37:25
Okay.
Scott Graebke 37:27
So we lock it out and start climbing around, looking for what, what is going wrong. And you see
that things twisted up. And so, well step one is you got to get that thing out, because we're
going to have to replace it and we can't get it to move. So we got to get it out and we got to
get it out in place. And so, what can we do to do that? And so we get, get the ladders out and
start trying to refine it and get it to pop back where it goes so that you can get it to move and
and ultimately, we ended up having to break it out.
Jared Schmidt 38:01
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 38:02
Because it was locked in there so hard, you don't want to break that, that bus, you don't want
to break that fiberglass box because that runs the full length and, and if that doesn't work
S
S
S
S
to break that fiberglass box because that runs the full length and, and if that doesn't work
then,or if you have to replace that, then that's not an instock part, that's something you don't
expect to break. So, that's the sort of thing that you plan to replace at some point, you know,
and right now I think we're two years out before we're gonna replace, replace the bus.
Jared Schmidt 38:30
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 38:30
So we broke it out and then, and then, and then we have to we have to replace it. And, so, how
do you replace it? Well, we got to so,we got to unwire all the wires from the trolley and drag it
down to the end of this thing where you're supposed to take those things out
Jared Schmidt 38:50
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 38:50
put a new one in which we did have in the stock, our parts room is really, really good.
Jared Schmidt 38:55
What room?
Scott Graebke 38:56
The parts room.
Jared Schmidt 38:57
Okay, parts room, okay.
Scott Graebke 38:58
We have a parts room that's, that's fantastic compared to anywhere else I've worked. Most
places that I've worked have a, have a small closet somewhere that's kind of like a junk pile of
all the parts that came off the machines. We actually have a stock of brand new virtually
everything.
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 39:19
Hmm.
Scott Graebke 39:20
And so we go get a new trolley, put it in the, put it in the track and drag it back down to the
crane.
Jared Schmidt 39:26
Yeah
Scott Graebke 39:27
Get the fall protection out and climb on top of the, on the, on top of the cab and wire them back
up and, and then, then hope for the best. It's dark in there and there's a lot of miles attract so
you do your best to, to not a lot of miles, there's 400 feet I think of, of this bus. But it's hard to
inspect the whole thing to find out if it's, if it's working because it's 25 feet off the ground and
you'd have to look in the, look in a half inch slot the whole way down which you can't really do
unless you're riding the crane. And it's energized so you shouldn't, so none of those things are
things that you do, you get, if you need to do that you get the Westphalia crew to come out
and, and they have procedures that will allow them, but that's that's the big safety no no, to
ride the friggin crane, so anyway.
Jared Schmidt 39:46
Mhm. [ILL]
Scott Graebke 40:21
...a little bit yeah. But that's an example of a bad day because that's a, that's like a six hour
repair.
Jared Schmidt 40:27
Just for that one
Scott Graebke 40:29
yeah
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 40:30
the one trolly, kind of...
Scott Graebke 40:31
The one trolley broke just because of access to it. Access is a big one.
Jared Schmidt 40:37
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 40:38
That never having happened before and needing to fix it without breaking anything else
Jared Schmidt 40:44
Right.
Scott Graebke 40:46
[To the the beagles] The hell are you guys doing?
Jared Schmidt 40:49
I think they're chewing on one of your wooden dowels there.
Scott Graebke 40:52
Oh, okay. Well good job guys.
Jared Schmidt 40:55
Eh, they look cute doing it [Scott chuckles], it's teamwork.
Scott Graebke 40:58
Yeah, good job, guys [laughs]. The knuckleheads.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 41:03
Well that sounds like an interesting adventure, though.
Scott Graebke 41:05
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 41:05
I didn't know about the ASRS machine as well.
Scott Graebke 41:08
There's, there's a lot of, like, really cool, weird stuff there.
Jared Schmidt 41:14
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 41:16
We had, we had another bad day where we had one of our, we call it a clarifier, which is a
centrifuge for, for part of the whey process. So after the, after the cheese is made, we got all
this whey and we are straining out, trying to get a lot of solids in the in the liquid that we send
to the whey plant, so when they dry it into whey powder, it's a more efficient process. So we've
gotta separate out as much water as we can. So we run it through a centrifuge, we call a
clarifier. We also have a separator and then a clarifier.
Jared Schmidt 41:52
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 41:52
But it spins at like 4800 RPM, it's this great big cone that, that is just whipping, like crazy, and it
shuts down on vibration.
Jared Schmidt 42:02
Mhm.
S
S
S
S
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 42:03
And so...
Jared Schmidt 42:04
Wait, you said it shuts down on vibration, or?
Scott Graebke 42:06
If it, if it detects vibration, it will shut itself down so that it doesn't blow up.
Jared Schmidt 42:11
Okay.
Scott Graebke 42:11
Because it's spinning so fast.
Jared Schmidt 42:12
Oh. Okay, okay.
Scott Graebke 42:15
And so we've had that happen. And then you got to go through, like, finding and you got to find
really, really small problems for stuff like that. And one of the day shift guys who's kind of an
expert on, on those machines determined that the motor was bad. So we, you know, would
spend pretty much a whole shift replacing the motor because it's a 150 horse, you know, 700
pound monster motor that, that
Jared Schmidt 42:40
The motor is 700 pounds?
Scott Graebke 42:42
Yeah, yeah, it's huge. It's about the size of the chair you're sitting in.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 42:47
Oh wow. This is an adirondak chair I'm in, yeah.
Scott Graebke 42:50
Yeah, and it's oriented vertically so you're not just, like, skidding it into place. You got to get it
off the ground and drop it into a hole, wrap a belt around it, retention it
Jared Schmidt 43:01
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 43:02
and then go through the bowl and make sure all the parts in there are good. And that was a few
months ago, that we had we had that one. That's another rarity. Those are another piece of
equipment that gets factory service
Jared Schmidt 43:16
Yeah
Scott Graebke 43:17
on a regular basis just to make sure that that sort of thing doesn't happen but you can't stop
everything.
Jared Schmidt 43:22
How long'd that one take ya?
Scott Graebke 43:23
That one was good 12 hours, I think. And that wasn't just me. I came in after the beginning of it
and a couple of other people finished it up at the end.
Jared Schmidt 43:34
Okay, so sometimes your jobs, your tasks and overlapping with other maintenance technicians
S
S
S
S
Okay, so sometimes your jobs, your tasks and overlapping with other maintenance technicians
as well, and...
Scott Graebke 43:43
Yeah. You try not to do, we call it pass down work, where you didn't finish so you got to have
somebody else finish it before it needs to run it. If you're, if you're doing your best and on your
best day you finish your work before you go home but that's not always possible.
Jared Schmidt 44:01
Right, so like clarifier.
Scott Graebke 44:04
Right, right. Or sometimes even when we have a rebuild, plan rebuild where, like the octopus
machine. It's actually called the 8600, I don't know why but, when we have to rebuild that we
start with the night shift crew, we'll tear it apart and day shift crew will come and start
rebuilding chambers, and swing shift crew will put a chain on it, and then the night shift crew
will put the chambers back on and and hopefully it's you know, by the next day, it's it's got new
parts all over the place and back up and running and working the way it's supposed to. And
that's so, that sort of passed down happens sometimes as well
Jared Schmidt 44:44
Okay.
Scott Graebke 44:44
but, especially with breakdowns you try not to pass those on to the next shift.
Jared Schmidt 44:49
As much as possible.
Scott Graebke 44:50
As much as possible. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 44:51
Right. So it sounds like you take care of everything that's from the ittiest bittiest of, like, it will
be a piece of cheese getting stuck...
S
S
S
S
be a piece of cheese getting stuck...
Scott Graebke 44:58
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 44:59
...too these twelve hour projects that are just the whim of the universe.
Scott Graebke 45:04
That's kind of the scope of, yeah, my job. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 45:09
[Laughs] That's so interesting, I guess, I think it might surprise people how many, how much
manufacturing goes into into cheese.
Scott Graebke 45:19
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 45:20
Did that surprised you as well when you started the job?
Scott Graebke 45:22
Yeah. I had never seen so much stainless steel in my life. I didn't know that much stainless
steel existed but everything in there is stainless that anything touches food.
Jared Schmidt 45:33
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 45:33
Of course the dairy piping's all gotta be stainless and...
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 45:36
Right.
Scott Graebke 45:37
Coming from outside of the dairy industry, I think, it's like, "Wow, don't make it out of stainless.
That's expensive!" And then I walk into this place and there's a thing the size of a semitruck
that's completely stainless steel. "Oh my god!" And everything is really expensive there, so...
Jared Schmidt 45:51
Right.
Scott Graebke 45:51
So, that's just part of the deal with food, I think.
Jared Schmidt 45:54
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 45:57
What was the question?
Jared Schmidt 45:58
Oh, no, now...were you surprised to see how much manufacturing played a role in cheese
manufacturing alone?
Scott Graebke 46:06
Oh. How much? Yeah. Yeah. I was...And you see the pictures of it back in the, back in the day.
And the cheese was made in vats, where guys were stirring up the paddles and cutting it with
actual big machete state type knives. And now all that's done by machines. We still have a
demo vat, but it's a modern demo that that has an automatic paddle.
Jared Schmidt 46:35
A demo vat?
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 46:36
We call it the demo vat because we make demo cheese in it.
Jared Schmidt 46:39
Ok.
Scott Graebke 46:39
Like small batch stuff, like for doing a...Say we wanted to do a vintage white with, with the
jalapenos in it or something like that. We would make it in the demo vat.
Jared Schmidt 46:54
Why is it calle demo?
Scott Graebke 46:54
Demonstration.
Jared Schmidt 46:56
Demonstration, okay.
Scott Graebke 46:58
Demonstration cheese, like test, test cheese
Jared Schmidt 47:01
Okay.
Scott Graebke 47:02
sort of stuff. Or we make the, um, we make the curds in the demo vat, the, the curds that the,
that you can buy at the Visitor Center.
Jared Schmidt 47:10
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 47:10
Right? Yeah, the things that always have my heart in more ways than one. here's that one?
[Laughs]
Scott Graebke 47:15
Yeah, yeah. We have to make those in the demo vat.
Jared Schmidt 47:19
Okay.
Scott Graebke 47:21
Because that, that cheese actually gets pasteurized and the rest of the cheese is just heat
shocked.
Jared Schmidt 47:29
Oh.
Scott Graebke 47:29
And the, so the kill process for any of the bad bugs is actually the aging. And so, but since the
curds don't get aged, that's what's got to be fully pasteurized.
Jared Schmidt 47:35
Mhm. Right.
Scott Graebke 47:44
And so we don't...8and so we'll fully pasteurize the milk that goes into that vat. Oh, yeah, sure.
Coolin' off?
Jared Schmidt 47:50
I'm gonna open the door a bit [ILL] Oh, yeah, get a little air flow in here, too.
Scott Graebke 47:55
S
S
S
S
S
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Jared Schmidt 47:56
Oh, that's okay.
Scott Graebke 47:56
[To the beagles] Alright, guys, be good.
Jared Schmidt 48:03
Yeah, so that makes, that makes a lot of sense. That, I mean, it's kind of all that, I guess, yeah.
With the curds you don't need to age it, because you just...
Scott Graebke 48:15
Yeah, you can't age it.
Jared Schmidt 48:16
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 48:16
Because it's supposed to be squeaky cheese which
Jared Schmidt 48:18
Mhm, right
Scott Graebke 48:18
it's got to be brand new.
Jared Schmidt 48:20
Yeah.
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 48:21
Straight off the line. So that that's, that's all like, a day, a day old tops, I think. Maybe two days
tops.
Jared Schmidt 48:28
Yeah, mkay.
Scott Graebke 48:29
So they, like in the summer when the visitor center saw a bunch of that stuff, they make
tomorrow's cheese the day before.
Jared Schmidt 48:35
Right.
Scott Graebke 48:36
So it's all brand spankin' new.
Jared Schmidt 48:37
Right. Pre-pandemic
Scott Graebke 48:38
Yeah, pre-pandemic, right.
Jared Schmidt 48:40
Right. Speaking of, how has the pandemic adjusted, or has it influenced your, your job at all.
Scott Graebke 48:48
Um, so I've been very lucky in that uh, my last job prior to the cheese plant, I got that job a
month before the financial crisis. And so I rode out the financial crisis in 2008...
Jared Schmidt 49:05
S
S
S
S
S
Right.
Scott Graebke 49:05
...with a with a job that I just got, so I didn't really notice it, I guess, the financial crisis. I was
very lucky on that front. And then this time, working at a cheese plant, we're, you know, part of
the nation's food supply and so we're considered essential and so rather than, you know, like a
lot of people lost their jobs or their the demand for their work evaporated. The demand for
mine went up and...
Jared Schmidt 49:40
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 49:41
And so it didn't, I wasn't out of work at all. The cheese plant was kind enough to bump
everybody's pay for the first year
Jared Schmidt 49:53
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 49:54
by a couple bucks an hour for, you know, kind of a hazard pay. Thanks for coming, keeping the
place afloat, that was, that was good. The really the, the only impact has been the social
distancing and the, and mask wearing, which I'm pretty introverted. So the social distancing
works out great for me and the mask wearing, just do it, it's, you know, it would be better if we
didn't have to, but you just, you just do it. So it's no big deal, I guess the the main thing that it
makes it difficult to bring in, outside, especially early on in the pandemic, when nobody knew
what the hell was going on or, and so everything's on lockdown like no outside people. So if you
need help finding a particular belt or particular motor for some project, and you would bring in
a sales rep or an engineer from an outside company to look at your process, and it's a lot easier
for you to say, "Look at that gear and, and sell me a belt, and a set of pulleys to replace that."
And they know their product lines, so they just go, "Oh, this one, this one, this one." You just,
"Give me those," buy it, put it on, and it's done. You don't have to go through their catalogs and
figure it out yourself.
Jared Schmidt 51:03
Right. Right.
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 51:23
You get them to do that. But now it's, you're not bringing those people in anymore. So that you
got to kind of do that sort of stuff a little with a little less support.
Jared Schmidt 51:31
So you've been able to maintain a pretty solid job, but things got a little complicated with
orderings, then, right?
Scott Graebke 51:39
Yeah, I'd, I'd say yeah, but the the work hasn't dried up at all, which has been a blessing.
Jared Schmidt 51:47
Right.
Scott Graebke 51:50
There's a few minor complications, and thankfully we haven't had any, like, really serious
breakouts and outbreaks in the plant. Um, you know, a few people have gotten it, but they've
been sent home and, to ride it out. And it hasn't, we didn't have a massive hundred people got
COVID event. And so it hasn't, there hasn't been a huge hit. And for whatever reason, when
the, when everybody bought all the TP
Jared Schmidt 51:59
Right. Mhm.
Scott Graebke 52:28
the stores decided they needed something for their shelves, and they ordered a lot of cheese.
So we had some of our biggest production months.
Jared Schmidt 52:38
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 52:38
Right after, right after COVID hit.
S
S
S
S
S
Right after, right after COVID hit.
Jared Schmidt 52:43
Ok.
Scott Graebke 52:43
Which was just kind of weird.
Jared Schmidt 52:44
Yeah, everyone was home, they needed some comfort food, and
Scott Graebke 52:47
I guess. Yeah. They needed comfort food or?Yeah, I guess you can kind of slice and watch
movie [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 52:56
Right. Or some ice cream, or...
Scott Graebke 52:58
Yeah. Yeah. But our sales went went way up. So we stayed very busy. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 53:06
So when sales went up...[ILL] They also went up was, well, your workload, I'm guessing as well.
Scott Graebke 53:14
Yeah, not too, not too bad, actually, that's...I guess that's one of the benefits of being a 24/7
operation is that we're already staffed for 24/7 operations. So you can't actually work more.
You just have to have more people doing it at the same time. It's not like, you know, previous
jobs where it's, you know, "Oh, it's busy month, everybody's got to work Saturday," you know.
Jared Schmidt 53:25
Right. Right. Yeah, it's not like a restaurant with "Mother's Day is onSunday, we've got to get
everyone on, on the floor."
S
S
S
S
everyone on, on the floor."
Scott Graebke 53:44
Yeah, it's we're already doing that, anyway, we're just, you know, trying to cram out a few more
pieces of cheese, or they might bring in like, the one of the things the cheese plant is brought
the, a bunch of the kids from the visitor center over to the plant side to hand package cheese.
Jared Schmidt 54:05
Oh.
Scott Graebke 54:06
And to get, to make the volume that was, that was being requested.
Jared Schmidt 54:11
Ok.
Scott Graebke 54:11
And so there were more people doing stuff. So there was a little bit more breakdowns because
more people equals more breakdowns. It's just part of the deal.
Jared Schmidt 54:18
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 54:20
But the amount of work hours worked, didn't really go up and it didn't go down either. So it was
pretty steady for the most part.
Jared Schmidt 54:28
Ok. You can say it stayed consistent.
Scott Graebke 54:30
Just rode it right on. Yeah.
S
S
S
S
S
Just rode it right on. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 54:32
Okay.
Scott Graebke 54:32
It's been good from that standpoint.
Jared Schmidt 54:35
Right. Good for you on that one.
Scott Graebke 54:36
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 54:36
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 54:37
yeah.
Jared Schmidt 54:38
And then, I won't, I won't keep you much longer because I know it's been a, we're running out
of time here, soon. I've something going on at two. More meetings. And you've got a floor to
put in.
Scott Graebke 54:50
I've got a floor to put in. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 54:51
Yeah. What do you think makes this, Tillamook Creamery so, so unique as far as like cheese
manufacturing and work techinque.
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 55:05
The uh, I'm not a lifetime dairy person. So I can't say for sure, but I was told that the amount of
rainfall that we get in the, in the region is, has been key to the quality of the milk and the
quality of the cheese.
Jared Schmidt 55:21
Okay.
Scott Graebke 55:24
And that, I think, is one of the things that drew, drew me to it as a place to work is that, you
know, if you live in Tillamook County and you work at the Tillamook Creamery, you're, the
chances, and you know, and it's owned by the cheese plant is owned by a co-op of farmers of
the farm owners. And so the chances of them shutting down the cheese plant and, and doing it
somewhere else is pretty low.
Jared Schmidt 56:00
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 56:00
Like as far as job security, it's pretty safe. Like it's about as safe a bet I can think of. Does that
get to the point of the question?
Jared Schmidt 56:10
Yeah, um...
Scott Graebke 56:11
Okay. I don't really know what the specifics are on the milk quality but I've been, I've been told
that our...You know, for instance, we make all of our cheddar in Tillamook, we make all of our
pepper jack and cojack and Monterey. All the soft cheeses, like I said, all the stirred curd
cheeses are made in our Boardman plant because apparently the, the, the milk is different
there and they can't get the same flavor profile out of it. They've tried making cheddar there, it
doesn't work.
Jared Schmidt 56:21
Right Huh.
S
S
S
S
Right Huh.
Scott Graebke 56:42
But they make it here it's just fine, so...
Jared Schmidt 56:44
That's interesting. Speaking of, which is, which is your favorite cheese? Do you have one?
Scott Graebke 56:49
Uh, my favorite is, like the vintage whites.
Jared Schmidt 56:54
Ok.
Scott Graebke 56:57
It's super sharp, super sharp, crumbly. It's not sort of thing that you can just sit down and
chomp the whole block up. It's, it's pretty, pretty strong. I guess, that's, that's my favorite one.
And that might...
Jared Schmidt 57:17
The white vintage ones, correct?
Scott Graebke 57:18
be just. Yeah. Yeah, those those are my favorite ones.
Jared Schmidt 57:23
Mkay.
Scott Graebke 57:23
And I think it's mostly just because of, you, you don't have it every day.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 57:28
Right.
Scott Graebke 57:29
The regular cheddar are...[To the beagles] Hi guys. Regular cheddars are really good and I
enjoy them on a, on a burger. But
Jared Schmidt 57:36
Yeah.
Scott Graebke 57:37
it's from something special standpoint, it's, I like the vintage whites.
Jared Schmidt 57:42
And how about the boys [the beagles]? Which ones do, what do they like?
Scott Graebke 57:46
They like the sharp cheddar, red bag sharp cheddar, [Jared laughs] not not the medium.
Jared Schmidt 57:55
Not the medium?
Scott Graebke 57:56
And the, probably the reason for that is that I got to cut it up into little cubes...
Jared Schmidt 58:02
Right.
Scott Graebke 58:03
...for them and the, the medium sticks back together a little too easy.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 58:07
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 58:07
And the sharp is firm enough that you can cut it into nice little cubes and double stick back
together. And it also doesn't crumble.
Jared Schmidt 58:17
Ok.
Scott Graebke 58:18
So, I've tried giving them extra sharp and it crumbles [One of the beagle's shakes head and
ears]. You can't cut it into cubes.
Jared Schmidt 58:22
Okay.
Scott Graebke 58:23
And, and I've tried giving them medium and it's just hard to, it's, it's softer. So it's, it's hard to
cut into little quarter inch cubes.
Jared Schmidt 58:33
Okay, so when Indi [Jared's dog] and I see you on our walk and youre giving them cheese it's
which one? It's the...
Scott Graebke 58:37
It's the red bag. It's the sharp cheddar,
Jared Schmidt 58:39
Red bag sharp cheddar.
S
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 58:41
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 58:41
[Laughs] I like that you tested.
Scott Graebke 58:45
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 58:46
That's, that's very fun.
Scott Graebke 58:48
Yeah it is.
Jared Schmidt 58:48
When you see the, you know, the Tillamook cheese, like, outside the county for sale or around
the country when you're traveling around or whatever...
Scott Graebke 58:57
Mhm.
Jared Schmidt 58:57
...does that make you think of anything in particular? Or how does that make you feel to see?
Scott Graebke 59:04
Um, I grew up with, I grew up in Seattle, so Tillamook cheese has been around my whole life.
And it's always been kind of one that that I've always bought so... you're coming to work
there's like, "Oh cool. I work at the cheese plant, I know we make good cheese and..."
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 59:15
Okay. Yeah.
Scott Graebke 59:20
And uh [Jared's alarm rings] it's never been a scarcity for me but I... I've been seeing, you
know, people that I, you know, on Facebook that are on the east coast, they go, "Oh, I saw your
cheese in the store today!" and they get excited about it. And that's Oh, that's cool. You know,
it's we're making it out there in the world.
Jared Schmidt 59:39
Right.
Scott Graebke 59:40
And it's being seen so it's it. Yeah, it's that's cool. It's like I say it's never been a scarcity for me,
but it's it's fun to see other people get excited about, about showing up in, in other places.
Jared Schmidt 59:54
Okay, one more question quick then Scott is what, what do you think is the Creamery has a and
influencing or how...Let me rephrase this. How would you describe the influence the Creamery
has on not just Tillamook the town but like Tillamook the county and this area? What influence
do you think it has on, maybe the identity or the whole thing?
Scott Graebke 1:00:19
I got to think it's, it's huge. Like I said, I've been here six years but I know everybody coming
from outside knows about it. It's, from a county perspective, I know that we're the biggest
employer in the county and you, you either work for the cheese plant or you work for the the
lumber yards or you work at a business that supports people that work at cheese plant or the
lumber yards. Those, those are the main economic incomes for the county. I know the cheese
plant is very supportive of, of the town of Tillamook, I assume the county as well as far as, you
know, giving cheese to the food bank and whatnot. And the, the, it seems like, you know,
people who own dairy farms in Tillamook are, you know they're the, the top dog [chuckles] I
guess is the way to put it. It seems that way to me but like...
Jared Schmidt 1:01:24
Right.
S
S
S
Scott Graebke 1:01:24
And I have a feeling its because most of people around Tillamook didn't want it.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:24
Right.
Scott Graebke 1:01:24
But like I said, I'm, I don't live in Tillamook and I don't know, but I I know the...I know the cheese
plant is very big time. And, and uh, and so it's influence on the, on the county...it's got to be
immense just from a...Like we don't have a Walmart, for instance.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:34
Mhm.
Scott Graebke 1:01:35
And [chuckles] and so the influence was there to, you know, keep them out. I heard, I heard
there was a push to get one and, and a, the story I heard was the they said, "Sure you can you
can build a Walmart, howeover won't give you a permit unless you redo the highway through
the entire downtown section to deal to deal with the traffic," and so they apparently Walmart
backed out. I don't know what that has to do with the cheese plant, but...
Jared Schmidt 1:02:36
Right
Scott Graebke 1:02:37
But small town community, kind of muscle sort of thing. It's kind of fun to see.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:42
Because we are in very small town, right?
Scott Graebke 1:02:44
Yeah.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 1:02:44
Rockaway is 1,500 [people], maybe?
Scott Graebke 1:02:47
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:48
Tillamook's what, 5000 [people], I think?
Scott Graebke 1:02:50
Yes. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:51
Tillamook, proper, at least.
Scott Graebke 1:02:52
Yeah, I think so. Like whole county, I think is 25,000 [people].
Jared Schmidt 1:02:56
Yeah. And there's, you can't go West because you know...
Scott Graebke 1:02:59
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:00
...the ocean [Laughs}.
Scott Graebke 1:03:00
Right. Can't go east because of the mountains.
S
S
S
S
S
Jared Schmidt 1:03:03
Yeah. [Laughs]
Scott Graebke 1:03:03
So...
Jared Schmidt 1:03:04
North or south.
Scott Graebke 1:03:05
North or south. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:06
Yeah. Okay, well, Scott, that's all I have for your day, unless you have something else you'd like
to add?
Scott Graebke 1:03:14
Um, I don't think so.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:15
Okay. Sounds good.
Scott Graebke 1:03:18
That was fun, thank you.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:19
Absolutely, Scott. Thank you so much. Let me see...[Jared works on turning off the recorder]
Scott Graebke 1:03:24
S
S
S
S
S
R2 dogus, what are you doing?
