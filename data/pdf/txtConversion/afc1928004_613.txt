WORKINGMEN'S STRIKE. 
Sung by the Original Shamrock Four. 
Written by MATT DALY,, 
JOHN DALY, DAVE CONROY, M IKE THOMPSON. 
We are four men of hard toil, 
As you can plainly see; 
We just came here from ould Ireland, 
In a 
ship called America; 
We've been out of work for a 
month or more, . 
And I 
tell you, me boys, it's a 
load; 
For divil a 
stroke of work have we done, 
Since the strike on the Narrow Gauge Road. 
CHORUS: 
For we're out all night, and we're out all day, 
I 
tell you, me boys, it's a 
load; 
For sorrow the stroke of work have we done, 
Since the strike on the Narrow Gauge Road. 
Oh, here we are, four Irishmen, 
And our hearts are as heavy as lead; 
I 
tell you, me boys, we are willing to work, 
If they .give us enough for our bread; 
There's many a 
poor man with his child, 
Who starving both night and day; 
For sorrow the stroke of work have we done, 
Or have we received any pay. 
For sorrow the stroke of work have we done, 
Since the strike on the Narrow Gauge Road, 
Written by N. J. M URPHY, for the Original Shamrock Four, DAVE", 
CONROY, MATT DALY, JOHN DALY, M IKE THOMPSON. 
Come to Casey's tin pan wedding, 
All the Irish will be there; 
Oh, such howling and such growling, 
And such cutting up so quare; 
All the Cork and Kerry people 
That resides in New York Town; 
Wearing high hats like a 
steeple, 
All the gang will sure be down. 
C [TORUS : 
All the Irish will be there, 
Bring along your Bridget fair; 
Make her wear her Sunday hair, 
When in the set she's dancing; 
Won't there be a 
how-de-how, 
When the gang gets in a 
row; 
None but buffaloes will be there, 
At Casey's Tin Pan Wedding. 
There will be ale, stale beer and whisky, 
Goose chowder and cat pie; 
And when Casey he gets tipsy, 
He will slug Riley in the eye; 
Old Pat Shay and Tim Maloney, 
From the town of Donnegal; 
Danced a 
reel for stale bologna, 
On the top of Casey's wall, 
(Chorus), 
SOUP! SOUP! 
Sung with immense success by the Original Shamrock Four, MATT 
DALY. DAVE CONROY, M IKE THOMPSON, JOHN DALY. 
When the soup house bells are ringing, 
It's then we will be happy and gay; 
And the tramps they'll all be singing, 
For they will get three meals a 
day; 
Oh, what a 
glorious time we'll have, 
All sitting in a 
group; 
Gathered around a 
pine-board table, 
A drinking turtle soup. 
CII0ItIJS: 
Soup! Soup! Soup! 
Oh, the glorious soup is boiling, 
Oh, my, what a 
healthy smell; 
Arrah, says Pat, the soup is fat, 
Why we micks like it well; 
Mary had a 
little lamb, 
She kept company with an Alderman; 
Oh, when the glorious soup is boiling— 
Good-bye sweetheart, good-bye, 
It's then the tramps will be singing ha, ha, 
For this beats 
When the soup house bells stop ringing, 
It's then we will he tramps; 
We'll go out in this wide world, 
And try and raise a 
stamp; 
Travel, boys, from yard to yard, 
And clean out each chicken coop; 
You can bet your life we'll never want, 
For a 
good old bowl of soup, 
(Chorus).

Sung with success by Messrs CoNaoy-, 
DALY, THOMPSON 
& DALY, the Original Shamrock Four. 
0 .-
Singing all the day, 
Lilian, my love; 
Ever blithe and gay, 
Pure as any dove; 
From my native isle, 
Far across the sea; 
I've wandered all the while, 
Soon I'll be with thee. 
Lily waits for me, 
Sweet wild flower, 
In her bower, 
That o'erlooks the sea. 
I 
will see thee, Lily, 
When the dew-drops shine, 
'Midst the flowered vine; 
I'll be with thee, Lilian, 
When day cloth break 
Upon the lake, 
And on the shore, 
'Midst grasses green; 
I'll meet my love, 
.)ly Emerald Queen. 
MY EMERALD QUEEN— CONTINUED. 
O'er the ocean spray, 
Lilian, my love; 
Swiftly all the way, 
Guided from above; 
To my dear old home, 
I've come back again, 
Never more to roam, 
O'er this vast domain. 
Then with Lily, dear, 
Cheeks so rosy, 
Sitting cosy, 
Breathing perfumed air. 
I 
would wed thee, Lily, 
Will you be my wife? 
Through joy and strife 
I'll protect thee, Lilian; 
She whispered low, 
" 
I 
love you so." 
'Midst glittering 
Of silvery sheen, 
I 
wedded my 
Sweet Emerald Queen.

Skinny Tight Pants. 
Written and sung by M. THOMPSON. 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
I 
am glad to see you well; 
If you listen to me a 
little while, 
My troubles I 
will tell. 
It's all about my blackguard boy, 
I'll tell while I've got a 
chance 
How he has gone to the bad entirely 
Since he wears the skinny tight pants. 
CHORUS. 
He's out all night till broad daylight, 
At every picnic and dance; 
He's gone to the bad entirely 
Since he wears the skinny tight pants. 
He came home here the other night, 
And loudly began to bawl, 
Saying, " Mother, come give me my supper quick, 
For I 
going to Wallahalla Hall." 
I 
says, " What's going on there to-night ?" 
" 
Don't you know," says he, " there's a 
dance r 
Indeed, I 
needn't expect anything else 
When you're cleaning your skinny tight pant3. 
He is out all night, &c. 
Now I 
am told he carries a 
pop, 
And dances the trallaloo; 
You ought to see him when he's all dressed up, 
Promenading the Avenue. - 
The girls are all dead mashed on him, 
And with him they love to dance, 
For his legs look like a 
pair of clothes pins 
When he has on his skinny tight pants. 
He is out all night, &c. 
Now I'll bid you all good-by, 
As my song is at an end; 
If there's anybody here with skinny tight pants, 
I 
hope none of you I 
did offend. 
Now, if you are going to a 
party, 
A 
picnic, or a 
dance, 
Take my advice, if you want to look nice, 
Don't wear any skinny tight pants. 
He is out all night, (
Su. 
Subelski's Daughter. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD. 
One evening lately I 
run out quickly 
To buy some fish for a 
Friday night; 
I 
went to Subelski's to buy some plunkeys, 
And what I 
saw there was a 
terrible sight. 
There was pike fish, pickerel, and plunkeys, 
And mackerel that had a 
terrible smell; 
A 
pound for two cents, three, or five cents, 
However they eat them I 
cannot tell. 
CHORUS. 
There's Subelski, the political speaker, 
In Tammany Hall, boys, he's got a 
pull 
I'll keep away from Subelski's fish store 
Friday noon, when the store is full. 
Subelski's daughter drinks Croton water, 
But she won't refuse a 
glass of beer; 
She is, like her father, a 
big wind bladder, 
And a 
crushed politician's beyond compare. 
He will run for Assembly or Congress 
On our coming election day; 
I'll put my vote in for Isaac Subelski, 
And he'll get elected to stay away. 
N There's Su belski, 8r.c.

Where was Solomon Isaacs when the 
Loafers Stole the Geese. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD. 
I'm a 
quiet Hebrew man, 
My business I 
know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
My troubles I 
will tell. 
It's about a 
gang that hangs around, 
And me they always teaze; 
And if I 
only turn my head 
From the cellar they steal my geese. 
CHORUS. 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese? 
What was he about when they cracked him in the snout ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
They kicked me all around the place, 
Until my head was sore; 
They wasn't satisfied with that, 
They want to give me more. 
My wife went almost crazy then 
From hollering out " Police ! 
There goes a 
gang of robbers there, 
They stole my husband's geese !" 
Where was Solomon Isaacs, &c. 
To the court next day I 
went, 
My wife Rachel and I. 
The judge says " What's your business here, 
What makes that woman cry?" 
I 
said, Oh, judge, good Mr. Judge, 
Just listen if you please: 
A 
gang of giraffes hangs round my store, 
And they always steel my geese." 
Where was Solomon Isaacs, &c.

The Levy Brothers. 
Written expressly for my friends HOWARD and THOMPSON. 
Respectfully, 
JAKE ISAACS. 
We are the Levy brothers, and what money we have made 
Was in the dry goods and the old clothes line. 
We could sell you some rich laces or fine pink calicoes, 
And we warrant every one of them so fine, 
On the shelves we got suspenders, neckties, collars and bows, 
Old hats, garters, and sleeve buttons, too; 
Take them at cost prfces, for, my gracious, they are cheap, 
And every word we tell you it is true. 
CHokus. 
We got dusters, and big ulsters, 
To hide bad actors' clothes from people's view; 
If you want to buy come give us a 
try, 
In Barter street the number's twenty-two. 
There's Alexander, our brother, he keeps a 
big pawn shop, 
That's where the sports and gamblers all do go 
With their diamonds and their watches and their sealskin 
overcoats ; 
For the faro bank the money all does go. 
Three balls is the sign, and the number it is nine, 
Terms cash is on the slate upon the wall. 
He is worth, we are told, ten thousand dollars in gold; 
If you want to hock just go and give him a 
call. 
We aot dusters, &G. 
Isaac and Moses. 
Written by DAVE H OWARD, and sung by HOWARD and TuomPsom 
nightly at Tony Pastor's Theatre. 
We keep a 
store in Baxter street, 
Our business we know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
A 
story we will tell 
About a 
fellow that come to us, 
He wanted to buy a 
coat; 
So help my Jimmy Christmas 
You never saw such a 
bloke. 
CHORUS. 
Isaac and Moses sells old elotheses, 
Down in Baxter street; 
No matter when you go that way 
Our wives you're sure to meet ; 
They'll holler out, and then they'll say: 
" 
What shall we sell to you ? 
We've got some very fine clothes inside 
We'll sell for a 
dollar or two. 
He made us show him all the coats 
That we had in the store ; 
We pulled them out, we pulled them in, 
Till we couldn't pull any more. 
So we told him if he didn't go out 
We'd give him such a 
bang; 
Now, what do you think he done just then ? 
He brought in all his gang. 
I.-:aae and Moses. &c. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD. 
My name it is Solomon Cohn, 
I 
keep a 
large clothing store, 
And a 
daughter I've got—only one— 
And she's got my whole body sore. 
She goes to the show every night, 
No longer this I 
will stand sir, 
If I 
say anything to her, she'll say, 
" 
I'm a 
great ballet dancer." 
CHORUS. 
On the stage her name is Schlimosky, 
Her right name is Rachel Schlivensky; 
She comes home every night, and bully blind tight, 
With a 
pair of black eyes she's a 
terrible sight; 
She is ray only daughter, she drinks nothing but Croton 
water. 
She's got a 
big nose, you could hang on your clothes, 
And the pride of the ballet is Rachel. 
She's going to get married next week 
To a 
handsome song-and-dance actor, 
And he says he'll make her look sweet 
When she's a 
good ballet dancer. 
He'll make her go around on her toes, 
Over in Niblo's Theatre; 
But she's got such a 
terrible nose, 
I 
don't think the managers will take her. 
On the stage her name, eze. 
Glass Put I. 
Written by DAVE HOWARD, and sung by him in " Glass Put In." 
Here I 
am, a 
Hebrew man, 
And glass I'll put in cheap; 
For fifteen cents a 
single pane, 
You bet I'll do it neat. 
I'll put them in most any size, 
And my price is very small; 
So, if you want some glass put in, 
I'll go and give you a 
call. 
CHORUS. 
0, glass put in. 
Say, glass put in? 
Say, missus, you want some glass put in? 
I'll do the job so nice and clean, 
You'll find that I'm no cheat; 
0, glass put in. 
Say, glass put in ? 
Say, mister, you want some glass put in ? 
That's what I 
holler the whole day long, 
As I 
go through the street. 
The gang they throw big stones at me 
Whenever I 
go out, 
And from the windows in the street 
You can hear the people shout: 
Say, mister, here, and mister, there, 
I 
want to give you a 
job; 
Because I 
put them in so fine, 
And they know that I'm no slob. 
Hebrew Politicians. 
Written by DAVE HOWARD, and sung with great success by HoAan 
and THomrsoN at the Windsor Theatre. 
Here we are two Hebrew politicians, 
When we run for office we got terrible opposition 
From every creed that is known in existence, 
We are the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
*When election time does come, lots of promises we do 
make; 
You should see them Hebrew voters how our money 
they do take, 
To go and cast their ballots, 'cause they know we take 
the cake, 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When we go out we dress up nice and neat, 
We eat a 
piece of garlic, to make our breath smell 
sweet; 
And the gang upon the corner holler, " Sheeneys, float 
your feet," 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
We are going to run for Alderman upon the next elec-
tion; 
Cast your eyes upon us—do you think we'll pass in-
spection? 
And if you want to vote for us, we won't have no 
objection, 
We're the Hebrew politicians of the day. 
And when we are elected we will do the best we can, 
We'll give a good day's wages to every working man; 
And the people all will say, " For them Sheeneys hip, 
hurrah, 
They're the Hebrew politicians of the day." 
When we go out, 8,:c.

Words and music by Tim ROGERS, as sung by him with great 
success at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theater Comique. 
I AM a 
swell. 
I 
lead the style; 
I'm not Champagne Charlie nor Tommy Coaloil. 
But you can see plain by my winning ways 
That I 
am a 
man that has seen better days. 
But for all that I 
don't care a 
straw, 
For I'm just as lively asever, ha, ha I 
The pet of the girls I 
meet every day, 
And as they pass by me this is what they say: 
CETORUS. 
Oh, my, ain't he a 
baby' 
Look at his walk—it's just like a 
lady 
Oh dear, 1 
believe it is Grady! 
Look at his nice curly hair. 
Look at me well. 
Do I 
look green? 
I 
have an eye that can capture a 
queen. 
With my graceful walk I 
make their heads whirl; 
My great Colorados the barbers do curl. 
I 
am a 
gambler at high jack and 'ow; 
I 
can play seven out and the great casino. 
There's no use in talking, now don't I 
look sweet? 
For as the girls sass xiae you'll hear them repeat: 
Oh, my, etc.

When I 
ran up the Ladder with my Hod 
Words by MASTER EDDY. Sung by FOSTER & DUDLEY. 
You've heard of politicians, 
With their brooms a 
sweeping streets ; 
And of the well-known policeman, 
As he walks along his beat. 
I 
never work in the Navy Yard, 
Nor do I 
dig the sod ; 
But like a 
decent, honest man, 
For ray health, I 
carry the hod. 
Cuoaus. 
Mike McCann, the mason, he will say— 
Scrape the mortar from your hod 
And bring your brick this way; 
Move about when you hear me shout, 
Ten hours every day, when I 
run up 
The ladder with my hod., 
There's an Irishman called Patsy Flu, 
Who wanted me to go 
About the streets of New York, 
In the Winter, and shovel snow; 
But before I'd think of such a 
thing 
On the President I'd trod ; 
I'd show him I 
was born and bred 
With my shoulder to the hod. 
Mike McCan the mason, &c, 
Now boys, if you would like to see 
A 
rough and tumble fight, 
()all 'round to the stable 
Where I 
bum all night; 
You all will see that Mike McCann 
Wa,

rm going to fight a 
duel 
With the man that stole my hod.

A

And I 
love mm better far halt gold or wealth, 
When I 
see him in his uniform so grand. 
The first time that I

With love I

And my lie3rt was in a

When Charley played the drum. And its

When Charley plays the drum. 
Oh! he often comes to take me for a 
walk, 
And we stray along together side by side, 
And so sweetly and so lovi ,Igly he'll talk, 
And once he ask'd me if I'd be his bride. 
And ev.ry Thursday evening, 
As soon as work is done, 
I 
hasten to the park to hear 
My Chtsrley play the drum. And it's 
When the Corn is -Craving. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Oh, meet me by the stile. 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
And greet thy winning smile.

And grace the beauteous scene.

Oh, meet me by the stile, 
To hear thy gentle voice again,

When the corn is waving, Annie dear, 
Our tales of love we'll tell, 
Beside the gentle flowing stream, 
That both our hearts know well. 
When wild flowers in their beauty, 
Will scent the evening breeze, 
Oh baste, the stars are peeping, 
And the moon, behind the trees. 
CH0.—When the corn is waving, Annie dam, 
Oh meet me by the stile, 
To hear thy gentle voice again, 
Aid greet thy winning mils.

You've heard of McCormick, the politician 
But I 
am the man that's wide awake; 
I 
can speak as long as O'Leary can walk, 
And for grammar I 
take the cake, 
I 
was seventeen years a 
Congressman, 
And in the Treasury I 
made a 
big dent; 
I'll have no trade dollars, but all iron money 
When Muldoon is your President. 
CHORUS. 
I'll give every bootblack a 
brown stone front, 
And the laboring man free rent; 
I'll make politicians walk on their hands to save their shoei 
When Muldoon is your President.

I'll build a 
railroad across the sea; 
I'll move Central Park to Washington, 
You can ride to California free. 
I'll tear down all the Elevated roads; 
No more Governors will be my intent; 
I'll have steamboats running by telegraph 
When Muldoon is your President. 
I'll give every bootblack, &c.

SCOTCH TERRIER JANE. 
Written by JAMES DREW, and sung with great success by DONNELLY 
& DREW, at Tony Pastor's Theatre, Broadway, N. Y. 
Parody on Scotch Lassie Jean. 
-: 
0 :--
I 
once knew a 
maiden who in New York did dwell, 
She was ugly and cranky all the time; 
She was struck on a 
baker and a 
dizzy undertaker, 
And a 
butcher in Cincinnati over the Rhine; 
One night the butcher called with a 
couple of pork 
chops, 
His love he tried to explain; 
He gave her a 
squeeze, and off came his nose, 
From the breath of this Scotch Terrier Jane. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Jane, Oh, Jane, I've got you on the brain, 
You have no reason to explain; 
Your teeth they are false, from taking epsorn salts, 
You're my liver-lip Scotch Terrier Jane. 
(Repeat). 
She's lovely and fair, and her feet they were bare, 
Her bustle it stuck out twenty feet; 
One day in the house she happened to eat a 
mouse, 
It gave all her lovers a 
treat; 
The butcher and the baker, and the dizzy undertaker, 
They went crazy when they all heard the news; 
I 
often heard them say, when she was put away, 
She died from hoisting Mott St. Booze. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Jane, Oh, Jane, my club-footed Jane, 
With tears I 
have cause to explain; 
You're a 
daisy that was lazy, your lips they were greasy, 
You're my sweet-scented Scotch Terrier Jane. 
(Repeat).

THE LIQUOR LAW. 
As revised by JOHNNY ROACH. 
ONE Mick MacGee, from Arranafee, who once was a 
hold 
sailor oh, 
But growing old, as I've been told, he turned a 
liquor dealer 
oh, 
To license Mick would not agree, or pay the excise bounty 
oh, 
But he sould away, both night and day, and beat the excise 
of the county oh. 
CHORUS. 
Arrah grammachree come drink with me, 
The liquor law won't injure me, 
.Arrah grammachree come drink with me, 
The liquor law won't injure me. 
I'm) policemen bold, as I've been told, heard Mick waa 
selling on the sly, 
So off they went, with full intent to get a 
bottle they did try, 
They went in then, dressed like rag-men, and took a 
seat 
down in the shop, 
Asked Mrs. MacGee if so kind she'd be, as to give them a 
bottle, of the real ould drop, 
Arrah grammachree, &c. 
A 
thought struck her then, that she knew the men, and a 
big black bottle she went and g,t, 
25 
fihe went into the room saying I9Ii be back soon, and she fill-
ed it nicely up with slops, 
I'll let you see, says Mrs. MacGee, the liquor I 
sell is the 
real ould stock, 
As she filled it right, she corked it tight, and she got two 
dollars for a 
bottle of slops. 
Arrah grammachree, &s. 
The police in glee ian off do you see, and stated the case to 
Kennedy, 
Who opened ilis 
eyes at cheating the excise, go bring your 
prisoner at once to me, 
You say she did sell, as he took a 
smell, [Phew] and what 
did you pay for the bottle you got ? 
Two dollars said they, we had to pay, why you foolish men, 
its nothing but slops, 
Arrah grammachree, &c. 
The police in dread hung down their heads, when they saw 
nicely they were done, 
Away they went from Kennedy, with the stinking bottle 
they thought was rum, 
And Mick MacGee and his wife Mary, keep selling away, 
at the same old spot, 
laci if a 
spy,:or a 
policeman comes around , she gives them 
a 
bottle of the real old stock.

AH! well I 
remember, one frosty December 
The winds whistled cold and the snow it fell sharp, 
( 
saw a 
young maiden whose arms were quite laden, 
She carried a 
little Hibernian harp; 
She &topped near the doot of a 
mansion so stately, 
The lights from the windows shone full in her face, 
I 
thought it my duty to watch that young beauty 
Whose foot pressed the snow with such delicate grace. 
CHORUS. 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp, 
The wind whistled keenly, but she sang serenely, 
And tinkled her little Hibernian harp. 
Bright jewels were shining, ' mid tresses entwining 
On heads of fair beauties, all blushes and sigh, 
But they saw not the beautiful jewels that sparkled 
And fell from the lids of this poor maiden's eyes 
As over the harp strings her fingers were straying 
The notes on the night wind came plaintive and slow 
The pale lamp of heaven shone forth on the maiden 
Who stood like a 
statue transfixed to the snow. 
And the wind, &C.

Jriginally sung with thunders of applause throughout the Eastern cities 
by the" Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
Here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here cast your eyes upon us; 
We unload coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace, 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace ; 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all live down in John McSauley's building, 
Last election day we cast our votes for Tilden; 
And they all do say we're the solidest in the building, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
By the one man, his razor, and his strop; 
We all get the lather from the one brush and cup, 
The two selected spooners of the gang.

Isn't a 
Dollar enough to buy Bread, and. 
Water costs Nothing at all. 
An original song by FRANK LEWIS, written for HA 
RRY 
W OODSON. 
In the city of Brooklyn is living 
A 
man, who himself once was poor, 
But that fact it would seem he's forgotten, 
Or he'd act very different,, I'm sure; 
Now I 
heard, on a 
late Sunday morning, 
These words from his saintly lips fall— 
" 
Isn't a 
dollar enough to buy bread ? 
And water costs nothing at all." 
CHORUS. 
Then no man will I 
count in the list of my friends, 
Who is deaf tc the workingman's call; 
And says—" A 
dollar is enough to buy bread, 
And water costs nothing at all." 
This wonderful preacher don't do much, 
Tho' he lives on the fat of the land, 
He has all that he wants—maybe too much, 
For he lives in a 
style that is grand; 
Yet this clerical and cheeky old fraud said— 
(Though two thousand a 
month is his pay,) 
That a 
workman should be very happy, 
On only a 
dollar a 
day. 
Then no man, etc.. 
This man is not known for his good deeds, 
Though for " gab " the world over he,s famed, 
He preaches to please his rich patvcms, 
And thereby has gamed a 
great iteme; 
But I'd much rather be a 
poor workman, 
When before judgment's seat we all stand, 
Than to be in the shoes of Ward Beecher, 
Who went back on the poor lahoriagman. 
Then no man, et%

There's nothing can compare, my boys, to rale McMullin : qt...

My father's blood is in may veins, and McMullin is my name,

The Escape of the Catalpia Six. 
Words by Thomas MAGUIRE, and sung to the air of " Little Robin, Tell 
Kitty I 
am Coming,'with great success, by DAN McCAirrny. 
Come, gather kinds, and listen, 
And a 
story to you I 
will tell, 
You, no doubt, have heard of Erin's great heroes, 
Who 
in the latest of battles have fell. 
But the greatest of things that have happened, 
And may never happen no more, 
Is the escape of the six Fenian prisoners, 
Away from Australia's shore. 
CHORUS. 
Let us hope then the day is not distant, 
When the Irish shall rise up in bands, 
And sever the bonds that unite them, 
And make of themselves a 
free land. 
When these good men were sentenced in Ireland, 
Their country for trying to save, 
They were sent to the shores of Australia, 
And there made the proud Saxons'. 
slaves, 
And they served out ten years of their life time, 
And they vowed that they would serve no more, 
Bo they escaped on the good ship Catalpia, 
And sailed for America's shore. 
(Chorus.) 
When the good men escaped to the whaleship. 
The authorities thought them to stay, 
So they sent out their warship Georgetta, 
Before they had time to away. 
" 
Now, we want you to deliver those prisoners, 
Or on you we will fire if you lag." 
And they answered, •' If on us you fire, 
You will be insulting our American flag." 
LITTLE MAGGIE MAY. 
THE spring had come, the flowers in bloom,

Was singing all the day; 
And how I

Maggie singing all the day; 
Oh! how I

With heart so light .nd gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie Iay. 
When others thought that life was gone, 
And death would take away, 
St ill by my sire did linger one— 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witchina 
May heaven protect me for her sake, 
I 
pray both night rind day, 
That I, ere long, may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May.

THE IRISH BRIGADE. 
Written, composed and sung with great success, by HARRY 
W HALING. at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. 
Now don't be alarmed, friends, at seeing me here, 
I'm a 
gem of the very first water; 
My appearance will show I'm a 
gentleman, too, 
I'm a 
son of a 
Marquis's daughter; 
My Mother, God bless her! she doted on me, 
Said of danger I 
ne'er was afraid; 
So when I 
grew to manh000d, a 
commission I 
bought, 
And I'm one of the Irish Brigade. 
Chorus—Then hurrah, hurrah, for the true sons of Erin, 
The stout-hearted soldiers are never afraid; 
They're true to the core, and in death ever daring, 
I'm Colonel Shea of the Irish Brigade. 
The Irish Brigade is a 
corps true and brave, 
And for fighting, the best in the land; 
In peace they're true-hearted, cheerful and gay, 
While in battle like lions will stand; 
And I 
am their leader, and proud to say, 
My soldiers all dote upon me; 
For oft midst the roar of the cannon they shout, 
"Give a 
cheer, boys, for brave Colonel Shea."— Chorus. 
To the roll of the drum they march gaily on, 
Through the fields, midst the dead and the dying; 
And high in the air, through the smoke can he seen, 
The Green Flag nobly flying; 
And there it waves proudly, amid shot and shell, 
While my men to the charge they are led. 
And they'll fight till they die, ere an inch they will fly, 
In defence of the flag o'er their head. 
Chorus. 
Then boys, give a 
cheer for the sons of our Isle, 
• 
In gallantry, none them excel; 
For their rights and their country they've oft led the way 
And like soldiers have nobly fell; 
Theg've fought and they've conquered their foes o'er and 
o'er, 
In foreign lands over the sea; 
And they'd try hard again, would my stout-hearted men 
If called on by brave Colonel Shea, 
Chorus, 
Written and sung by JouNNv ROACH, 
the successful Irish Vocalist, 
FAREWELL, IreIhnd, I 
can no longer dwell at home, I 
must 
cross the stormy main, 
Where cruel strife may end my life, to see you ne'er again, 
It will break my heart from you to part, astore acushala machree. 
But I 
must go full of grief and woe, to the shores of America 
So now farewell, I 
can no longer dwell 
At home, acushala machree, 
But I 
must go, full of grief and woe, 
To the shores of America. 
On the Irish soil my fathers lived since the days of Erin Banoo, 
They paid their rent and lived content, convenient to Killdew, 
But a 
landlord cruel gave us the shuel, mY poor old mother and 
me, 
We had to leave our home, far away to roam, and come to 
America. 
So now, &c. 
No more in the old churchyard, astore, on my father's grave

I3nt the tyrant knows, but little of the woes, that a

(Chorus.) 
Sung by Andy Collum. 
As I 
was coming down Broadway to-day, 
The boot-blacks on the corner at leisure did play, 
They all looked up and saw me by chance, 
Cried one stag the gauk he's got Mug° on his nant..;, 
I 
took my girl to the ball la.st night, 
The gang on the floor commenced for to fight, 
My daisy got drunk and they slugged her by chance, 
For mashing a 
sue who had tar on his pants. 
Now all you young blokes take a 
warning from me, 
Oh, never get married 1101.7 zorry you'll be, 
You'll go to the parks and you will meet them by chance, 
But beware of the daisy who wears fringe on her over-ails. 
As sung with immense success by Master GsoRoillA. M URRAY, 
the rising Young Comic. 
TO an evening party once I 
went and met such a 
nice young 
girl
 , 
Dressed oh, so tine and smothered in scent, my heart soon fell 
in a 
whirl, 
I 
asked her it she'd dance with me, she looked at me and smiled, 
She wouldn't say yes, she wouldn't say no, she'd quite a 
peat-
liar style. 
CHORUS. 
First she would and then she wouldn't, 
Then she smiled and said she couldn't, 
Then she said, oh George, you shouldn't, 
You're a 
naughty, naughty man. 
I 
sat,down by the fair one's side and gave her wine and cake, 
, 
I 
told her what I'd do and dare all for her own dear sake, 
She then looked up at me and smiled, I 
took that smile for bliss, 
And when the time for parting came, I 
tried to steal a 
kiss. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentlemen I, came very near doing 
It too, but she was one of those peculiar souls that— 
First she, &c. 
I 
thought it was time and so I 
had the business put on a 
spec, 
I 
sent my love a 
new silk dress her darlinz self to deck, 
Vim the wedding morn I 
called my intended bride to find, 
Not dressed at all and worst of all, she'd hadn't made up her 
mind. 
SPOKEN. —Ya 
al Arhen I °Aced what she meant, she thought 
Ahat— 
First she, &a. 
Well after that we married were, and live pretty nice a% home, 
There's one thing which my wife objects that's when I 
wish to 
roam,

men, 
toad if I 
go out at night I 
have to be home at ten.

' WHAT WOULD MAMMA SAY."

Sung by J. L. 
THAYER. 
Now some girls are bashful, 
And others are bold, 
Now I 
know a 
charmer 
Of nineteen years old ; 
About her—like some others— 
There was much pretense, 
For at th least thing 
She'd be sure to commence ( with her) 
Clioiaus. 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, 
What would Mamma say? 
What would Papa say? 
Oh, my! fie, for shame ; 
Get along Joseph, do„ 
I'd take her about 
To wherever she'd please; 
When we were alone 
She'd appear ill at ease; 
Now a 
kiss, once a 
week, 
Every fellow'd expect, 
But when 
tried for one, 
She'd be sure to object ( with her) 
Oh, my! fie, for shame, &AL

Her Pa and her Me. 
Out of town chanced to be, 
So I 
called on my charmer, 
And with her took tea; 
The time like a 
slow 
Quaker's meeting did pass, 
Till she somehow by accident 
Turned out the gas. 
SPOKE11, — There we were all in the dark. I 
was afraid 
to move for fear of breaking something, and she couldn't 
or wouldn't find the matches; when she found I

Oh, my! fie, for shame, Sze. 
he seemed, oh, so awfully 
Coy and demure, 
That I 
thought her complaint 
Only marriage would cure; 
So I 
asked, " If she wed, 
Did she think she would die ?" 
She pretended to faint, 
But her only reply was— 
Oh, my! fie, for thame, 
Now I 
found out this bashful 
And timid young lamb 
Was simply a 
con-
glom-er-a-tion of sham; 
To Iwo other parties 
Her kisses were free ; 
Perhaps she had one of them, 
But she didn't " have me," ( with her) 
Oh, my! fie, for sham, air

Put a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Grave. 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside. 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
-
That now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother so true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
Half so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone here to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, etc.

Whitcomb." 
Oh, skies were bright and blue,

And roses in their silvery light were sleeping, 
The day had glided by, 
We thought the iealous hours were creeping, 
We parted with a 
sigh. 
Oh, ever in my heart my rose I'm keeping,

Ohl we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in tnw past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would tall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again.

Ohl they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget;

By the rippling of the tide, 
As I

Ala I

That flow and ebb at will,

RING THE BELL SOFTLY 
-SOME one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty, Death's fingers are laid. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
CHORUS. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet; 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow and sin, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in. 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their light. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Hcven s 
glad shore t 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, ,to.

Here we are, two Irishmen, 
Just come across the sea; 
Ye're looking well, God bless ye all, 
We are glad to see ye that way. 
Our brother he's an Assemblyman, 
And he's as popular as Noah's ark, 
And when we did land he put in our hand 
A

Oh, Sensible Park! Sensible Park! 
From daylight till dark; we're up with the lark, 
And all the girls sure we do spark 
Beyant in Sensible Park. (Repeat.;

Sometimes we feed the monkey, 
And when we get their cage cleaned out, 
Then we feed the donkey. 
The other day we got blind drunk, 
And we took a 
sleep in the elephant's trunk, 
And I 
tell you what it's a 
cosy bunk, 
Beyant in Sensible Park. 
Oh, Sensible Park, &c. 
There's the eagle and the elephants, 
The tiger and giraffe, 
And to sec the tricks in the monkeys' cage, 
Begorra it would make you laugh. 
They have animals there from everywhere, 
And all the ropes and chains they tear; 
And that's the place to see the bears, 
Beyant in Sensible Park.

When I'm dead and gone from you darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above;

Oh, the days will come to you darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
While other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinicing of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I

THERE is a 
girl not far from here, 
Who stole my heart away; 
Her eyes are bright as stars at night, 
So lively and so gay. 
We met 'twas in a 
woodland dell, 
Where berries sweet do grow; 
'Twas there we plighted both our loves, 
And I 
named her my June Rose. 
CHORIIS. 
For she's just as pretty as a 
bouquet of flowers, 
That in the garden grows; 
And she has promised to be mine, 
My lovely sweet June Rose. 
We often meet each pleasant eve, 
And wander through the grove; 
And while the moon is beaming bright, 
We whisper then our love. 
Until the parting hour comes, 
Then from her I 
must go; 
But when she's mine no more I'll part 
From my logely sweet June Rose.

You Were False, But I'll Forgive You. 
Sung with immense success by Miss Georgie Melnotte 
the Queen Serio-Comique. 
Fare thee well, for once I 
loved you, 
Even more than tongue can tell, 
Little did I 
think you'd leave me, 
Now I 
bid you all farewell. 
You have wrecked the heart I 
cherished, 
You have doomed me day by day, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.] 
When I 
saw your eyes in virtue, 
I 
could scarce believe my own, 
When I 
heard your voice in anger, 
It was death to every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
And you believed them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may. 
[Repeat last two lines.1 
One more word and all is over, 
Why are you unkind to me? 
Tell me why you do not love me, 
Turn aside how can it be ? 
No word not one word of pleasure, 
You believe them all they say, 
You are false but I'll forgive you, 
But forget you I 
never may.

There are songs unsung in ev'ry heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear-drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded, and withered, and dead. 
Oh ! beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS— 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish. 
Tho' some are sombre and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clung, 
They are set in tears and never can die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung, 
Beautiful songs unsung, &c, 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love, 
That in kindness and truth were spoken. 
But now are the links of a 
glad, wild dream, 
Cherished and loved, yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kissed by death, 
Oh! sorrowful sungs unsung.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HIMPTY D:1IIPTY 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
ft is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by aft 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
Au ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called 
ilIIMPTY DIMIPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking if 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated. suit; the next, only. Columbine; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at . home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
