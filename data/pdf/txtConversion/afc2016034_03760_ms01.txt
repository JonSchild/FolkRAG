Oral History of Alison Smith, Director of Atti's Eats Pet food and Supplies Pantry; 
Bismarck, North Dakota on April 4, 2017 
Summary of Interview 
Alison Smith started Atti's Eats Pet food and Supplies Pantry, operating in Mandan, Bismarck, and at 
times statewide in North Dakota. The organization provides pet food, pet supplies, and assistance with 
the animals of people living in poverty and homelessness. Atti's Eats operates largely out of a trailer that 
Alison brings to locations where the pet supplies are distributed; it therefore does not have a permanent 
address where it provides services. 
This interview took place in a room at the Bismarck Veterans Memorial Library at 515 North 5th Street, 
Bismarck, North Dakota, 58501. 
Note: Photos accompanying this oral history were taken on Alison's farm, with Alison, her husband, and 
their pets.
