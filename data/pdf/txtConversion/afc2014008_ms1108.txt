Dear Judy,
 
How delightful to hear from you, complete with an application too!
 Our grants
 
office snatched the application away to do their mysterious thing with it
 
before I had a real chance to look.
 I am sure it is in fine shape though,
 
and I will call right away if there is any problem.
 
Folk Arts is delighted to hear that you're coming to see us.
 If by any
 
chance your housing arrangements break down, be sure to let me know and we
 
can work something out surely.
 I have a sad feeling that Lynn will not be
 
able to arrange to come to the Fife Conference this year, but I continue
 
to urge you to make the trip.  My colleague in the office here, Barry Bergey,
 
will be there, and I am sure you will find him a pleasant and informative
 
new friend.
 
Judy, I feel very remiss not to have written you before.  You and John were
 
so very hospitable, and I had such a wonderful time during my recent visit
 
to Guam; it is really scandalous that I
've not written you before.  All I
 
can say is that I
've not written anybody else either!  and that it hasn't
 
been for want of thinking with affection of the pleasant and productive time
 
we spent together.
 I just arrived home with a perfect mountain of absolutely
 
immediate things-to-be-done.  But that's the usual state of affairs for us all,
 
I suppose.
 I guess we must just be kind to each other and try to realize that
 
no one does as well as we would hope we could.
 
It is wonderful to hear that metters are proceeding so well in Guam.
 I hope
 
that they continue so.
 Please let me know if I can be of any further help...
 
YqA&& ever,
 
yu

Dear Bess,
 
I just put together the application package for our third year funding
 
for the Apprenticeship Program.
 I
t should arrive at about the same time
 
as this letter.
 
The office has been a flurry of activity since you left; Ric, Tony, and
 
1 have had a lot of discussions both prior to and during the grant application
 
writings.
 We feel that we've come up with a comprehensive two-year plan
 
that encompasses various facets of the folk arts program satisfactorily.
 
Kim Bailey and Bill Paulino (from Chamorro Studies) and I have also had several
 
meetings to coordinate planning for the Chamorrita Singing Contest.
 
If all goes as planned, it looks to be a fruitful, busy time for the folk arts.
 
I called Lynn Martin to see if we might work out room-sharing for the
 
conference in Logan, Utah.
 She is not sure that she will be able to go due to
 
the Paniolo exhibit.
 I hope to see her and the exhibit in Hawaii on my way to
 
the conference.
 
Delfin Damian of our Arts Council has been assigned to oversee folk arts
 
grant applications.
 He has proved to be very supportive and helpful.  We are
 
working together to put together a knowledgable, working Folk Arts Panel to
 
review grant applications.
 
I am enclosing one of our recent CAFIA Happenings column which features
 
a photo of you and Jack Lujan.  He was so pleased to have his picture in the
 
paper with you.  As the other news photo notes, Rob Limtiaco is now on his way
 
to Puluwat.
 
The itinerary for the Washington part of my trip this summer is tentatively
 
set.
 I will arrive in Washington D
.C. July 1 and depart on July 6
.
 It will be
 
nice to see how the Fourth of July is celebrated in our nation's  capitol.
 It
 
looks as if my husband will be able to come with me.
 I am arranging for lodgings
 
in the Chamorro community through the help of Congressman Ben Blaz.
 I
'm looking
 
forward to seeing you again and to visiting your office there.

Dear Judy,
 
As I am sure you have heard by now, I will be coming with Chairman Hodsoll to
 
visit Guam March 4 and 5
, but perhaps you have not heard that while the Chairman
 
goes on to Japan from Saipan, I shall return to Guam to stay over the weekend
 
before proceeding back to Washington.
 I will arrive in Guam at 6
:15 pm Friday
 
March 6 on flight HK #313 and leave on March for Honolulu at 6
:45pm on flight
 
Continental #6.
 
Generally speaking, I assume that I will be involved in the activities planned
 
for the Chairman during our joint visit (March 4 and 5) though of course I will
 
make myself available for anything especially you might like me to do during
 
those separate days.  When I come back (March 6-8) I would be both available
 
and delighted to confer at length with you or Mr. Pangelian or your advisory
 
council or anyone else you might like to have me meet.  I would also be
 
available for any site visits that you would like to have me make, and I
 
could also confer with anyone on grant related matters.  I
'm all yours for
 
those two days and I apologize in advance for inflicting myself upon you over
 
the weekend, but that's just the way the calendar turned out!
 
I should add, however, that if you want to take the weekend off, I don't
 
require entertainment and can happily amuse myself resting up a bit at my
 
hotel and catching up on my notes and trip diaries.
 I would love to drive
 
around a bit and do a bit of visiting, but don't feel you have to worry with
 
me every minute.
 
I am of course especially interested in developments concerning the apprenticeship
 
program and hope to get a chance to discuss it with you at some length.
 I do
 
feel a bit worried over the idea of setting the apprenticeships inside the
 
traditional village; in fact, I wonder if a traditional village is exactly what
 
you want to establish anyway.  I have been to many and they have a tendency to
 
begin to feel like zoos after a while, where the visitors wander around and the
 
local artists sort of learn how to do tricks or say things that amuse the
 
visitor.  Your artists have much to contribute to their own fellow citizens and
 
to the future of Guam, not just to the edification of tourists!

I remember during my first visit to Guam being taken to Lanchon Antigo.
 It
 
was pleasant but seemed deserted, and the small huts in which the craftspeople
 
were supposed to be were a long way apart from each other so that they seemed
 
isolated and lonely.
 I was driven north along that coast to a place I liked
 
enormously off the highway to the right down towards tha ocean where you had
 
to walk down a good bit along a dirt road and came to a kind of large open
 
verandah-style hut where a lot of women and older gentlemen were sitting
 
around gossiping and joking sociably and making baskets, weaving mats, carving
 
a little.  Off to one side was an open fire where the men were distilling salt
 
from seawater; one gentleman carved me a section of bamboo for a drinking glass
 
(
 I still have it) and gave me a drink of palm wine (first day!).
 It was so
 
friendly and natural and just the kind of place you would really want to visit.
 
I don't believe it is going anymore, but I would hope that its spirit could
 
live on in your new facility, whatever it might be.  The key, it seems to me,
 
is to set things up from the point of view of the craftsperson and the
 
participant, not just for the convenience of the tourist.
 
Well, we'll get a few chances to talk all these things over when I come, I hope.
 
I do look forward to seeing you -
-
 and Monty Cohen and so many other friends and
 
acquaintances in your beautiful island.  Please let me know in Hawaii (care of
 
Bernie Lopez or the Hawaii Arts Council) if there is anything I can bring with
 
me that might be of use.  Or of course you could phone me here  before I leave -
202/682-5449 until 6
:00 pm EST February 19.

Hello from Guam.  I recall with great warmth our meeting with Betty Tatar at the Bishop
 
Museum in Honolulu towards the end of Summ er 1985.
 You were so very enthusiastic about
 
the Call of the Morning Bird project, and you spoke to me of your keen interest in
 
knowing the results of the distribution of the project in Micronesia.
 
I am pleased to present you with this copy of the Call of the Morning Bird final report.
 
The original copy of the report has been sent to Betty Tatar at the Bishop Museum.
 
Hopefully, YOU will enjoy reading this and you will be able to capture some of the
 
uniqueness of this very special endeavor assigned to me of bringing the Call of the
 
Morning Bird back home.
 The very memorable people encoun tered were the highlight of this
 
Micronesian research endeavor.
 
In case YOU need to make copies of portions of the report, it is being sent to you
 
unbound. Hopefully you will not be inconvenienced since the report is unbound,
 
f you have other questions about the field distribution that are not answered by this
 
'
eport, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Be sure to let me know if you need other
 
information that does not appear here.
 
:
n behalf of Betty Tatar and the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, I wish to thank you most
 
sincerely for your interest in and your support of the Call of the Morning Bird project.
 
The project stands as a very creative and worthwhile research endeavor that has received
 
the generous support of the National Endowment for the Arts.
 
Best wishes from Guam,

FIELD  RESEARCH  TRIP  TO  YAP,  PALAU AND  PONAPE  FOR THE  DISTRIBUTION
 
OF  "CALL OF THE
 MORNING  BIRD"
 
A Report  Prepared  for  Dr.  Elizabeth  Tatar
 
Director,  Call  of  the  Morning  Bird  Project
 
Department  of  Anthropology,  Bernice  P.  Bishop  Museum
 
Honolulu,  Hawaii
 
and
 
Ms.  Bess  Lomax Hawes
 
Research  Grant  Coordinator
 
National  Endowment  for  the  Arts
 
Washington,  D.C.
 
Dr.  Rebecca A.  Stephenson
 
Chair  and  Associate  Professor  of  Anthropology
 
Department  of  Anthropology,
 University  of  Guam
 
February  1986
 
I

A
 
Introduction
 
In
 the
 course  of  the  Micronesian  Expedition  in
 1935-1936,
 
Iwakichi Muranushi  collected  chants  and  songs  of Palau,
 Yap
 and
 
Ponape,
 recording
 them
 on
 wax
 cylinders with  the
 aid
 of
 a
 
dictaphone  recorder.
 Muranushi,
 an  anthropological
 researcher
 
from
 Japan,
 was
 attached  to  a team of Japanese  scientists
 who
 
came
 to  conduct  research  in  the Western Pacific  from
 the
 Saito
 
Ho-on
 Kai Museum of  Natural History  in  Sendai,
 northern
 Japan,
 
and  the  Bernice  P.  Bishop Museum in Honolulu,  Hawaii.
 
Upon
 the
 close  of  the  expedition,
 the wax  cylinders
 were
 
eventually  returned  from Japan  to  the  Bishop Museum,
 where-
 they
 
sat  in  repose.
 In  1978,
 th e wax
 cy
li n ders  caug
ht t he attention
 
of Dr.
 Elizabeth Tatar,  Ethnomusicologist  in  the  Bishop  Museum's
 
Department
 of Anthropology.
 With  partial  funding  from  the  Folk
 
Arts  Program of  the  National Endowment  for  the Arts,  and with  the
 
support  of  Ms.
 Bess  Lomax Hawes,  Research Grant  Coordinator,  Dr.
 
Tatar
 initiated  a project  to  preserve  the  historically
 valuable
 
Muranushi
 Collection
 of Micronesian music.
 The
 aims
 of
 the
 
project
 included:
 rerecording
 the
 cylinders;
 locating,
 
obtaining
 and
 translating
 supporting documentation
 in
 Japan;
 
transcribing
 and  translating  the  song  texts  in
 the
 collection;
 
and  preparing a catalog  of  the  collection.
 Finally,
 the  entire
 
collection
 was  to  be  distributed  to  appropriate  individuals
 and
 
organizations
 in Micronesia,
 where  the  collection  could be more
 
widely
 appreciated
 and
 utilized
 by
 the
 local
 communities,
 
especially
 in  the  localities  where  the  original  taping had
 been
 
completed  in  1936.
 
Fifty
 of
 the  re-recorded  chants  and  songs  of  1936  are
 now
 
included
 on
 a modern  cassette  tape,
 which
 is
 featured
 in
 a
 
booklet
 entitled
 "Call  of  the  Morning  Bird",
 prepared
 by
 the
 
Department  of Anthropology,
 Bernice  P.
 Bishop  Museum,  Honolulu,
 
Hawaii.
 The  booklet  contains,  in  addition  to  the  tape,
 61  pages
 
of
 ethnographic
 text
 describing
 the
 Micronesian
 expedition,
 
transcriptions  and  translations  of  a number  of  the  recordings,  as
 
well  as
 historic  photos  taken during  the  expedition.
 
The  final  portion  of  the  "Call  of  the  Morning  Bird"  project,
 
as
 mentioned
 above,
 was  designed  to be  the  distribution
 of
 a
 
number  of  the  booklets  including  the  tapes  back  into  the  hands  of
 
the
 people
 of
 Yap,
 Palau
 and
 Ponape.
 As
 a
 cultural
 
anthropologist
 in
 residence  at  the  University of Guam
 who
 has
 
conducted
 field
 research  in Micronesia,
 and  as
 a  Bernice
 P.
 
Bishop Museum Research Associate  in Anthropology,  this writer was
 
asked  to  complete  the  distribution  portion  of  the  project.
 
During  the  period  September  10-12,
 1985,  this writer was  on
 
Yap,  and  from  September  12-16  the  writer was  on  Palau,  overseeing
 
F
 
2
 
the
 distribution
 of
 "Call
 of
 the
 Morning
 Bird"
 in
 these
 
localities.
 Field  time  at  Ponape was  the  period  September  26-29,
 
a separate  trip.
 In  a Travel  Report  to Dr.
 Patty Jo  Hoff,  Dean
 
of
 the  Col-lege  of  Arts  and  Sciences,
 University  of
 Guam
 dated
 
October
 2,
 1985
 (attached),
 basic
 information
 about
 the
 
distribution  effort  is  chronicled.
 The  purpose  of  this  report  is
 
to
 present
 in-depth  descriptive  ethnographic
 details
 of
 the
 
field
 project
 in  the  course  of which  the  "Call of
 the
 Morning
 
Bird"  publication was  distributed  in Micronesia.
 
YAP
 
September  10,  1985.
 
Upon
 arrival
 at
 Yap
 at
 mid-day,
 Andrew
 Kugfas,
 Yap's
 
Historic
 Preservation Officer  and my  contact  person  for  the
 Yap
 
distribution  effort,
 met me.
 After  presenting him with his  copy
 
of
 "Call  of  the Morning  Bird"  and  briefing  him,
 we  drove  to  his
 
office  in Colonia,
 the  district  center of  Yap,  to meet  the  Mayor
 
and  Chief  of  Rull Municipality,  Fernando  Falauaath.
 The  original
 
taping at  Yap  in  1936 was  done  at  Balebat  village  in Rull.
 Chief
 
Falauaath
 was
 eager  to  preview the  tape,
 in
 case,
 as
 Kugfas
 
explained
 .
 .
 . "there might  be  something  on  it  that
 would
 be
 
sensitive
 to  people  now  .
 .
 .
 perhaps  something about  a woman
 
that  might  be  embarrassing  to  her  family  or  clan"  .
 .
 .
 etc.
 The
 
Chief
 listened  intently  to  the  tape,
 and  agreed with  the
 names
 
that
 have  been  printed  in  the  booklet  for  the major
 performers,
 
Gakin  (B-13,
 page  51  of  the  publication)  and  etc.
 The  chief  of
 
Rull
 in
 1936
 was  Ruepong,
 according
 to
 the
 current
 Chief.
 
Ruepong
 was
 the
 son
 of
 Tarag.
 Tarag
 was
 the
 brother
 
Falauaath's
 mother.
 Tarag was  the  oldest  child  and  Falauaath'
 
mother was  the  youngest.
 A sister of  these  two  is  still  alive
 
perhaps  she  is  the  oldest  person on  Yap,  or  one  of  the  oldest,
 
the
 present
 day.
 The man named John
 Wag,
 mentioned
 by
 Dr
 
Elizabeth
 Tatar  as  a possible  contact  person  on Yap,
 is  a  ve
 
old man,  and  not  in  good  health.
 For  this  reason,  we  will  not  bt
 
able  to  call  on him.
 
As
 to
 why  the  taping  was  done  at  Balebat
 in
 
19?6,
 Chief
 
Falauaath,  who was  born  in  1920,  offered  the  suggestion  that  Rull
 
Municipality
 is
 close
 to  Colonia.
 It was  easy  for
 the
 1936
 
Expedition  team  to  go  there.
 Also,  many Outer  Islanders  live  at
 
Madrich village  in  Rull,  which  is  near  to  Balebat.
 This may have
 
been
 the  reason why  Outer  Islanders were  included  in  the
 taping
 
and why  their  pictures were  taken  in  1936.
 The  photo  on page  50
 
in
 the
 booklet
 of  two men  described  as  "Tattooed
 men
 of
 Yap
 
Island",
 for
 example,
 is  not  a picture  of  Yapese  men,
 but
 of
 
Outer  Islanders.
 
Some  of  the  language  of  the  songs  and  chants  may  be  hard
 to
 
understand,  offered Tim Thornburgh,  Executive  Director  of  the  Yap
 
Community Action Agency and  office  mate  of  Kugfas,  because  it may
 
be
 trading  language  of  the  Outer  Islands.
 Singing  and  chanting
 
shares  "the  news"  about  people  as well  as  about  events;
 some  of
 
it  is  like  gossip,
 serving  as  a chide  or  rebuke.
 Thornburgh,  an
 
ex-Peace  Corps  volunteer who  is  married  to  a Yapese  woman  and
 is
 
well  versed  in  Yapese  culture,
 continued:
 "In  the  old  days,
 a
 
I
 
person  goes  crazy when hearing  a song  sung  about  himself/herself,
 
if
 it
 is
 that
 kind  of  a song." Also,
 there
 were
 double
 or
 
multiple
 meanings  to many  of  the  songs  and
 chants.
 They
 were
 
poetic,  metaphoric,  or  "purposeful."
 
Chief  Falauaath wished  he  could  hear more  Yapese  songs.
 We
 
recalled
 that
 there were  additional  songs  and  chants  of Yap
 on
 
the
 cassette  tapes  sent  to  Yap  from Bishop Museum earlier  on
 in
 
the
 project,
 and  Kugfas went  off  to  track down
 the
 additional
 
tapes.
 It  was  about  dinnertime  by  then.
 We  finalized  our  plans
 
for  the  presentation  at  Balebat  the  following day.
 
September  11,  1985.
 
Vincent  Parren,
 the  man who  had  attempted  to  transcribe  and
 
translate  the  Yapese  portions  of  the material  in Honolulu,  talked
 
with
 me  in  the  morning.
 He  regretted very much  that  he was  not
 
more
 successful
 in  the  translation
 work,
 describing
 the
 old
 
language  on  the  tapes  as  "ghost  language",
 language  that  is more
 
or  less  lost  now.
 Balebat,
 he  pointed  out,
 was  a high  ranking
 
village.
 Probably
 Balebat
 organized
 a  special
 ceremony
 of
 
welcome
 for
 the visiting  Japanese  research  team  in
 1936.
 Or,
 
people
 of  Balebat  could have  been  chanting and  singing  to
 teach
 
the
 young
 people.
 Or perhaps  the  people  were
 celebrating
 the
 
completion
 of
 a  new house  being built,
 or
 a  stone
 platform
 
completed  for  a meeting place,
 and  the  Japanese  team was  invited
 
to
 come
 and
 observe.
 Maybe  no
 special
 ceremonies
 had
 been
 
organized  at  other villages while  the  Japanese  team was  on Yap  so
 
they were  invited  to  ceremonial  activities  at  Balebat.
 Or,  maybe
 
the
 Japanese
 team was  not  invited  to  go  to  other
 villages,
 or
 
there  was  no  time  to  go  to  other places.
 In  those  days,
 access
 
to
 other
 villages would  not  have
 been
 easy.
 Travel
 between
 
villages
 was  around  the  coast  by  canoe  or  bamboo  raft.
 A canoe
 
could  carry  10-20  people.
 Four bamboo  logs make  up  a raft
 that
 
will
 carry
 one  person
 -
 with more  bamboo  and
 larger
 bamboo,
 
bigger  rafts  can be  constructed.
 In  any  case,  travel  to  distant
 
villages  was  something  of  a challenge  in  those  days.
 
People  are  busy now,  Parren  reflected,  too  busy  to  learn  the
 
old  songs  and  chants.
 Younger men  can dance  but  they  cannot  sing
 
or  chant,
 i.e.,  they mouth  the words without  really knowing what
 
they
 are  saying.
 A few younger men might  be  able  to
 translate
 
the
 words  they  sing,
 but  it  is mostly  old  people who  know  these
 
things.
 Or,
 younger
 people
 might
 know
 the
 words
 but
 not
 
necessarily  the  proper meanings.
 Parren pointed  out  that  in his
 
position
 as
 Language
 Arts  Specialist
 for
 the
 Department
 of
 
Education on Yap,
 he  and  others  are  trying  to  standardize  Yapese
 
orthography.
 Their work concerns  Yap  proper  as well  as  the  Outer
 
Islands.
 Born  in  1951,
 he  acknowledges  that  there  is  little  or
 
no
 written  information on  the  past  in  Yapese,
 but,
 of
 course,
 
there  is  oral  tradition.
 
Many
 villages  on Yap,
 Parren  says,
 do  not  have  pebaey  (or
 
pebai)  (traditional meeting  houses)  anymore.
 The  people  of
 the
 
village
 may meet  on  the  stone  foundation  platform where  the
 old
 
pebaey  used  to  stand.
 If  there  is  rain,  since  there  is  no  house
 
I
 
to
 provide
 shelter,
 the
 meeting  does  not
 take
 place.
 This
 
phenomenon  lessens  contact  between  people  in  the  villages  in
 the
 
manner
 of
 the
 old
 days.
 Many people
 are
 working
 for
 the
 
government  of  Yap  in  Colonia now;
 time  is  spent  traveling  on  the
 
bus
 back  and  forth  to  and  from Colonia  each  day.
 There  is  less
 
time  for village meetings.
 
Item  B-12,
 page  51  of  the  publication
 -
 Parren says
 
men's
 dance
 is  still  being  done.
 It would be  done  on
 special
 
occasions:
 the  completion of  a public  or private  building  in  the
 
village,
 during  a government  inauguration,  the  completion  of  the
 
building
 of  a canoe  for  the whole  village,
 the  finishing
 of
 a
 
village municipality project.
 Or,
 if  all  agree,  men will  dance
 
to
 celebrate  a new chief being  titled;
 this  is  a lawful matter
 
now,  i.e.,  a son of  a chief  succeeds  to  his  father's  title  by  law
 
on  Yap.
 Or,  men may  dance  to  celebrate  Rull Day,  the  anniversary
 
of  the  date when  the municipality was  chartered.
 At  such
 times,
 
food  and  drink will  be  exchanged  among  the  participants.
 Before,
 
people
 exchanged  tuba  and  coconuts;
 now  they  exchange  beer and
 
vodka,
 according  to  Parren.
 Different  categories  of  dances
 for
 
Yap
 include
 sitting
 dances,
 standing
 dances,
 men's
 dances,
 
women's  dances,  children's  dances,  and  also  stick dances.
 
Item
 B-13  of  the  publication,
 page  51  -
 men might  sit  and
 
drink and  sing,  but  songs  like  this  one  are  being  forgotten,  says
 
Parren.
 People
 tend  to  forget,
 because  the  modern
 system
 of
 
learning  is  not  like  the  traditional  system.
 You  do not  have  to
 
memorize  now,
 as  before.
 If  you  don't  understand  something  the
 
first  time,
 you  can  go  back  to  your  book and  look  it  up  a second
 
time.
 So,  when  younger men hear  the  traditional  songs,  they  are
 
not
 as
 quick  to  pay  attention  and memorize  what  they
 hear,
 as
 
they
 do
 not
 practice  su ch  s kill s 
in 
the 
modern
 educational
 
system.
 
Item
 B-16,
 page
 53  of  the  publication  -
 this  is
 a  young
 
man's
 song,
 says
 Parren
 (in
 spite  of  the
 fact
 that
 it
 is
 
described
 as  a female  solo:
 perhaps  a young man wrote  the  song
 
for
 a  woman
 to
 sing) .
 Perhaps  the
 young
 man
 made
 it
 up
 
especially
 for  the  1936  taping  in  Balebat,
 according  to  Parren.
 
The  words  and  the  theme  of  the  song  are  unfamiliar.
 Parren  says
 
he  has  never  heard a song  anything  like  this  before.
 In  the  last
 
line  of  B-16,
 Parren notes,  the  3rd  from  last  word  should  be  nga
 
instead  of  gna.
 
Parren  reflected  that  very diplomatic  language  was
 required
 
to
 get
 things  from another  party  in  the  traditional  society
 on
 
Yap:
 "Maybe
 it
 would  take  two  days  of  conversation
 with
 you
 
before
 you would  know what  I want  from you,
 in  the
 old
 days."
 
Everything  is  more  free  and  straightforward now.
 "Because  it  was
 
so
 hard  to  travel  from place  to  place  in  the  old  days  by
 canoe,
 
one
 needed  to make  sure  that  one  could  get  what  one  wanted  after
 
finally
 arriving
 at
 a  place.
 The
 diplomatic
 language
 was
 
required  in  order  to  accomplish  one's  ends."
 
Kugfas
 took
 me  to meet  the  Governor
 of
 Yap
 State,
 the
 
4
 
S
 
Honorable  John Mangafel,
 on  Sept.  11  at  2 P.M.
 We  presented  him
 
with
 his
 personal
 copy
 of  Call
 of
 the
 Morning
 Bird,
 took
 
pictures,
 and
 chatted.
 He
 was
 very  enthusiastic
 about
 the
 
project.
 
Kugfas
 and  I met  with  Chief  Falauaath  and  six  older men
 at
 
the  men's  pebaey  at  Balebat  at  5:30  P. M.,
 the  time when  the
 men
 
are
 free  from  the  day's work.
 This  is  not  the  pebaey where
 the
 
1936  taping  took place.
 That  pebaey no  longer  stands,  but  it was
 
located
 where  the  famed  "Stone  Money  Bank"  of  Rull  still  stands.
 
The  men  identify  the  big  pebaey as  the  one  in  the  photograph  that
 
I  zeroxed  from  the  collection  at  the  Micronesian
 Area
 Research
 
Center
 at  the  University  of  Guam  sent  by Dr.
 Elizabeth Tatar  in
 
the  early  stages  of  the  Call  of  the  Morning Bird project.
 A tar
 
sealed
 road
 and  cement  kerbstones  now line  either  side
 of
 the
 
road where  the  big pebaey  stood,
 in  front  of  the  huge  rai,  stone
 
money.
 The
 road  improvement  work was  completed  on Yap
 in
 this
 
locality within  the  last  three  years.
 The  Chief  said  (and  all  of
 
his
 comments were  translated  to me  by Kugfas)  that  three  old men
 
and  two  old women  in  Rull  are  of  the  age  category  that  they might
 
have
 been  a part  of  the  original  taping.
 But  they are
 not
 in
 
good
 enough health  to meet  with us.
 One  strong voice  among  the
 
Yapese  singers  is  that  of  Farrapin  (identified  in  B-12,
 page
 51
 
of  the  publication).
 Farrapin's  son,  an  older man himself,  sits
 
with  our  group  today.
 He  covers  his  face when he  first  hears  his
 
father's  voice  on  the  tape,  but  when he  takes  his  hands  away  from
 
his
 eyes,
 he  is  smiling.
 Of  the  remaining  songs  on  the
 tape,
 
many are  lost,
 says  the  Chief.
 Some  were  very  famous  songs when
 
he  was  young.
 
Yapese were  forbidden  to  drink during  Japanese  times,
 Chief
 
Falauaath  recalls,
 .
 .
 .
 "but  we  still  had  the  drinking  songs.
 
You
 people  (Americans)  gave  us  the  booze,
 you  know,
 gin,
 rum,
 
whiskey,
 brandy.
 .
 .
 We  did have  our  own  coconut  toddy,  but  it
 
was  not  that  strong.
 We  drink now,  but  we  do  not  sing  those  old
 
songs
 when
 we  do."
 The  remaining  songs  on  the  tape
 cannot
 be
 
translated,  he  commented  after hearing  them.
 But  the women  still
 
do  the women's  bamboo  dance  (B-15,  page  52  of •the  publication).
 
The
 other
 Yapese
 tapes  that  had  been
 borrowed
 from
 the
 
Governor's
 office were  listened  to with
 great
 enthusiasm,
 the
 
ones  sent  earlier  from Bishop Museum.
 About  drinking,  the  Chief
 
continued,
 "Drinking actually began during German  times.
 Yapese
 
traditional
 society was very oppressive.
 The  drinking and
 the
 
songs
 allowed  for  release  of  tension.
 The  Japanese  stopped  the
 
drinking.
 But,
 with
 American  times,
 drinking
 began
 again."
 
Kugfas
 added:
 "Even now  the  need  is  there  to  release
 tension.
 
Then  the  society was  divided  into  low,
 middle  and high  castes
 -  
very
 oppressive.
 When  foreign booze  came  on  the  people
 (sic),
 
people
 went
 out  of  themselves
 -
 let  off  the  lid
 -
 let
 off
 
s team." 
It  is  raining  softly.  All  of  the  six  older men  gathered  here
 
together
 with us  look  to  be  above  the  age  of  forty.
 All  are  in
 
Western  dress,
 wearing  bermuda  shorts  or  slacks,  sports  shirt  or
 
o
 
T  shirt,
 watches;
 three  men  put  on  eyeglasses  to  look
 at
 the
 
booklet.
 They
 sit  against  back  rests  on  the waist  high
 raised
 
floor,
 on  the verandah  of
 the  men's  house,
 inside  the  verandah
 
area
 proper  or
 at  the  edge  of  the  verandah.
 They  leave
 their
 
zoris
 outside.
 All  chew betel nut  and  carry  Yapese  style  betel
 
nut  baskets.
 Between  them  they  speak Yapese,  Japanese,  and  some
 
English.
 They point  out  that  some  ±Yapese'  songs  identified
 in
 
the
 text
 are
 really Outer  Island  songs.
 They are
 trying
 to
 
identify
 a  song  sung by Farrapini  concerning  a man
 from
 Gagil.
 
"They've
 got  it now,"  Kugfas  says  enthusiastically.
 Farrapin's
 
son  feigns  elaborate  carelessness  as  he  fashions  a bandana  into  a
 
roll  and  ties  it  around his  head  as  a headband.
 All  the
 while,
 
however,  he  is  listening  intently  to his  father's voice.
 One  old
 
man
 reminisces
 about
 those  days with a beatific  smile
 on
 his
 
face,
 speaking  softly.
 He  is wearing  eyeglasses,  a blue  cotton
 
sport
 shirt,
 grey  slacks  and  zoris.
 He  knows  this
 song.
 He
 
articulates
 the
 words  along
 with  the  tape,
 and
 he
 looks
 so
 
pleased.
 All
 of
 the
 old
 men
 laugh
 and
 talk
 animatedly.
 
Farrapin's
 son
 smokes  a cigarette,
 and  the  smoke  curls
 softly
 
upward
 in  the  gathering  dusk.
 The men  look at
 their
 booklets
 
again.
 I  catch
 the  word Okinawa  in  their
 conversation;
 the
 
Chief makes  the  gesture  of  a round,  fat  stomach and  then,  sailing
 
out
 to  sea.
 Farrapin's  son  laughs  heartily.
 This  pebaey
 was
 
built
 in  1947,
 the men  reckon.
 There  are  no nails
 holding
 it
 
together;
 it  was  all  tied  together with  sennit.
 Before  1947,  a
 
bigger
 men's
 house
 stood
 on  this
 site,
 on
 the
 same
 stone
 
platform.
 A  great
 typhoon  damaged  some  of  the  houses  in
 this
 
area,
 including
 the  bigger  house  at  this  site,
 prior  to
 1936,
 
they  recall.

 The  old man  sitting  across  from me  puts
 on
 
again  so  that  he  can get  a closer  look at
 the
 old
 
uded  in  the  publication.
 The  old men  all  comment  on
 
1 quality of  the  tapes.
 They  talk animatedly,  trying
 
xactly  the  circumstances  under which  the  taping
 took
 
y laugh  a lot.
 Farrapin±s  son  gazes  off  into  space,
 
one  money  standing here  and  there  among  the  trees
 as
 
nland  from where  he  is  sitting.
 The  old man

 voices.
 Farrapin's
 son
 
melody  and  sings  along.
 In  the  gathering dusk,
 we
 
e sound  once  again  of  the  rain  falling.
 The woman's
 
song
 that  we  hear  now  is  still pretty much
 alive,
 i.e.,
 the
 
women  still  sing  it.
 Farrapin's  son  sings  softly along with  the
 
women's  voices  on  the  tape.
 We  are  close  by  the  sea here,  as  the
 
pebaey
 stands  perpendicular  to  the  shoreline.
 The male
 voices
 
come  on  once  again.
 Kugfas  translates:
 "This  kind  of  singing  is
 
tempura uta  (a Japanese  word),  all mixed up,  or blended.
 The men
 
are
 laughing
 because
 this
 is  not  really
 a  Yapese
 style
 of
 
singing.
 The  wording  is  very awkward.
 The  song  is  an  imitation
 
of
 something  else  -
 it  is  a combination
 of
 Yapese,
 Palauan,
 
Ponapean,
 Japanese,
 whatever.
 The
 Yapese
 singer
 was
 
±experimenting'
 in his  song.
 It  sounds  strange  to  these  modern
 
men."
 
This  village.  Balebat,  is  very near  to  Colonia,  the  district
 
center.
 There
 was
 no
 old  traditional
 village
 located
 where
 
Colonia  is  now.
 Or,
 the  area was  part  of  a couple  of  different
 
villages
 on
 the  opposite  side  of  the  bay
 from
 Rull.
 On
 the
 
hillside  up  above  the  bay,  on -the  same  side  of  the  bay where  Rull
 
is,
 the
 land
 was  possibly planting  lands  in
 those
 days,i.e.,
 
nobody
 lived  there.
 Balebat  is  a high  status  village  in
 Rull.
 
Madrich,
 the  Outer  Islands  village,  is  nearby.
 It  is  rather  old
 
as
 an Outer  Islands  village  location but  the  men cannot  seem
 to
 
recall
 when Madrich was  established.
 Other  researchers  say  that
 
Madrich  traces  its  history and  its  name  to  the  Spanish days,
 mid
 
1500's
 to
 mid
 1800's.
 The
 High Chief
 of
 Rull
 gave
 Outer
 
Islanders
 permission
 to  live  at  that  site,
 on
 land
 that
 had
 
belonged
 to
 the  Catholic  church.
 The  village  likely  takes
 its
 
name
 from Madrid  in  Spain.
 Outer  Islanders  have
 a  continuing
 
need  to  come  into  Colonia  for medical  reasons,  religious  reasons,
 
trade,
 and  the  like,
 but  being  of  lower  status  than  the  Yapese,
 
where
 they
 may  reside  on Yap  is  restricted.
 This  is  why
 they
 
were  given  their  own village  site  many years  ago.
 
Some
 of  the  men  are  still  looking  through  their
 copies
 of
 
the  publication.
 A younger man  (under  forty)  has  joined us  now.
 
The majority of  these  older men gathered  together would  have  been
 
young
 people  in  1936.
 They were  at  Japanese  school  during
 the
 
day,  but  at  home  at  night.
 None  of  them seem  to  exactly  remember
 
the
 taping
 by Muranushi.
 Maybe  they were  too
 young.
 Kugfas
 
offers:
 "Well,  in  the  old  days,  there  were  often visitors  to  our
 
villages  and  we  danced  a lot.
 It's  hard  to  separate  in  our minds
 
one  time  of  dancing and  chanting  from another.
 Also,  in Japanese
 
times  it  was  so very  different  from now.
 We may have
 forgotten
 
(the
 actual
 taping)  because  of  the  many  changes
 that
 American
 
times  has  brought."
 
Kugfas  speaks  softly  to me:
 "We  cannot  stay  here  any  longer
 
now because  th ere
 is no  e lectr
ic ity  at  this  pebaey.
 
When  it  gets
 
dark,
 it  is  not  permissible  (sic)  to  stay here.
 We  will  now all
 
leave.
 The men must  go  home  to  their wives  and  families.
 Not  in
 
the  old  days,
 though.
 In  the  old  days,
 the men would  have  sat
 
here
 and
 talked,
 recalling  the  past,
 all  night."
 The
 Chief
 
directs
 an  inquiry  to me.
 Kugfas  translates:
 "Why don't
 you
 
send  someone  to  come  and  tape  us  now,  make  another  recording?
 We
 
could
 sing,
 and we  would  ask  the  women and  the  young people
 to
 
perform,
 too.
 There  are  more  people  here  to  sing  and  chant  now
 
than
 there were  at  the  time  the  tape was made  in  1936.
 Then we
 
could
 save
 this
 part  of our  culture  today
 for
 another
 fifty
 
years."  I promise  Chief  Falauaath  that  I will  pass  on  his  request
 
to  Betty Tatar  and  Bess  Hawes.
 Maybe  both of  them would  like  to
 
design
 a  project  that would  represent  Phase  II of  Call
 of
 the
 
Morning Bird,  Chants  and  Songs  of Micronesia  in  1985.
 
We
 all  slowly disperse,
 the men  still  laughing  and
 joking
 
good-naturedly
 ("Be
 sure  you  send  a woman  out
 to
 tape
 us!").
 
Kugfas
 explains
 that  the  women  of  Balebat  are  not  permitted
 to
 
come  to  this  men's  house,  only  foreign women,  or women  from  other
 
municipalities.
 Kugfas  reflects:
 "You know,  the  ice  was  broken
 
back
 there,
 as  you  say,
 when  they  all  began  to  talk
 at
 once,
 
7
 
laugh,
 speak animatedly  and  reminisce.
 We  could  have  been  there
 
all night!"
 Kugfas  continues:
 " That  old  big pebaey  that  stood
 
at  the  stone  money  bank at  Rull,
 the  one  in  the  picture  from  the
 
Japanese  expedition,
 extended  from  the  beach nearly  to  the  road.
 
There
 used
 to  be  a dancing  ground  there  as  well  as  a  road.
 I
 
danced  there when  I was  a little  boy.
 Our  greatest  problem
 (in
 
Yap
 these
 days)  is  the  loss  of  Yapese
 identity.
 "Yapese"
 is
 
whatever
 makes
 me  different  from Palauans.
 But  now we
 Yapese
 
wear
 clothes,
 drive
 automobiles,
 seek  to  earn
 Western
 style
 
money,
 carry
 our
 betel
 nut
 in
 plastic
 bags,
 want
 to
 eat
 
ramburgers.
 It's
 good,
 though,
 because  our
 government,
 Yap
 
State,
 is  in  the  red.
 Not  like  elsewhere  in Micronesia  and
 on
 
Guam."
 (But  the  Yapese  manage  their money carefully,
 according
 
to
 Kugfas.
 For
 economic
 reasons,
 they
 refused
 to
 send
 a
 
delegation  of people  to  the  South  Pacific  Festival  of  the  Arts  in
 
Tahiti,
 even
 though  the  governor of Yap  State wanted
 them
 to.
 
Likewise
 they  refused  to  promote  and  expend money  for  the
 Outer
 
Island  navigator who wanted  to  sail  a canoe  to Yokohama).
 Kugfas
 
adds:
 "Our  population  is  young,
 maybe  70% under  the  age  of  17.
 
There
 were  only  2,000  of us  left  after World  War  II,
 and
 there
 
had
 been  50  thousand.
 Yes,
 family planning  is  discussed  here,
 
but
 we  don't  need  it.
 We  need more  people.
 But  in  ten
 years
 
time,  we  might  have  a population problem."
 
Kugfas  then  offers  a few parting  thoughts:
 "There  are
 not
 
very many  old  people  here  in Yap  .
 .
 .
 We  have made  the most  of
 
public  transportation.
 I am proud  of  that.
 Our  people  ride  the
 
bus  in  and  out  of  the  municipalities,  coming  into  Colonia  to work
 
and  going  back home  at  night  on  the  bus.
 It  cuts  down  on  all  of
 
the  vehicles  we  would  otherwise  need.
 But  some  of  us
 -
 like  me
 
-
 like
 to  drive  our  own  pickup  or  car.
 Then  I can work
 late.
 
Only
 after
 the
 others
 are
 gone  at
 5  P.M.
 can
 I  work
 on
 
correspondence.
 You  know,
 English  is  a second  language  for me.
 
Correspondence
 is  one  of my hardest  jobs
 -
 getting  the  letters
 
right  that  must  go  out.
 I need  quiet  time  in  order  to  do
 that.
 
Sometimes  I stay  at  the  office  until  7:30  P.M."
 
September  12,  1985.
 
Vincent  Parren  assisted  me  with my  luggage  in  the morning  as
 
I  prepared  to  go  to  Palau.
 He  was  eager  to  hear  the  outcome  of
 
the
 distribution
 of  "Call  of  the  Morning  Bird"  in
 Balebat
 the
 
previous  day,
 and was  pleased  to  know  that  the  old men had
 been
 
so  animated.
 
At
 the
 Yap  Airport,
 waiting  for my  flight  to
 Palau,
 I
 
noticed  a large  group  of  Ulithians  gathered  together.  The  islands
 
of  Ulithi  atoll  are  outer  islands  of Yap.
 The brother  of
 Chief
 
Hathay,
 I  was
 told,
 was  very  ill  and was  being
 med-evacuated
 
out;
 the  Ulithians were  there  in  support  of  him.
 Among  them was
 
my good  friend  Linda Ylmarig,
 a University of Guam graduate
 who
 
is
 a  dental  technician  at  Falalop,
 the  main  island
 in
 Ulithi
 
atoll.
 I learned  that  Linda  is  now married  to  Philip Nery's  son
 
who
 lived  in  the  States
 while  gaining  a University  degree  there
 
-
 a  perfect
 man
 for Linda,
 who  is  very
 Westernized
 and
 yet
 
chooses  to  live  at  Ulithi  atoll  to  help  her  people.
 "They  say  on
 
y
 
Ulithi
 that
 my husband  is  too American,"
 Linda
 smiled.
 "His
 
ideas,
 his ways  of  talking  and  thinking
 .
 .
 .but,  you know,  the
 
young  people  are  at  our  house  every morning  and  every night,  just
 
talking
 to  us  and  listening  to what  we  have  to  say-.
 Ulithi
 is
 
changing
 -
 our  past  is  very  important,
 but  we  have  to  look
 to
 
the  future,
 too.
 The  older  people must  accept  the  inevitable."
 
Since
 Outer
 Islanders
 are  represented  in  Call  of
 the
 Morning
 
Bird,  I gave  Linda  a copy  of  the  publication.
 She was  delighted:
 
"Oh,
 we  will  play  this  tonight!
 Please  thank Dr.  Tatar  and  the
 
Bishop Museum  from  the  people  of  Ulithi  atoll."
 
PALAU
 
September  12,  1985
 
After  arriving  at  Palau  at  midday,
 we  went  straight  to
 the
 
big
 bai
 (men's  house)  at  Airai.
 My  researcher  associates
 are
 
Tina
 Rehuher,
 Director,
 Palau  National
 Museum,
 and
 Jeffrey
 
olegeriil
 and Antonino Kloulchad,
 representing  the Division
 of
 
Cultural
 Affairs  of  the  Republic  of  Palau.
 Six older men  along
 
with
 the  Chief were waiting  for us  here  in  this  bai;
 they
 are
 
rubaks  (older  titled men).
 Most  of  the men were  14-16  years
 of
 
age
 in  1936,
 but  one man  calculated  that  he was  six  years
 old.
 
The
 bai  itself  is  a magnificent  structure.
 The  rubaks
 reckon
 
with  pride  that  this  bai was  built  between  80-160  years  ago.
 It
 
has
 had
 major  repairs  four  times
 Most  of  the  floor  is
 still
 
made  of  the  original  ironwood;  the  side  walls  and  the  corners  are
 
original,
 also.
 The  roof  has  been  repaired.
 There  are  two  fire
 
pits  in  the  bai.
 The  smoke  from  the  fire  treats  the wood  of  the
 
bai,  and  keeps  bugs  out.
 No  local  women  are  allowed  in here.
 
In  a photo-essay  entitled,
 "House  of  a Hundred  Stories"
 by
 
Ronn
 Ronck,
 in  Glimpses  of  Micronesia  and  the  Western
 Pacific,
 
Vol.
 18,  No.  1
,  1st  Quarter,  1978,  pp.  52-56,  the  bai  of Arai  is
 
featured.
 Rorick
 says  the  bai was  originally built  around  1890,
 
and  that  it was  renovated  a few years  ago  by  the  people  of
 Airai
 
as
 a  community
 project.
 It  is  located  in  the  center
 of
 the
 
village  on  a stone  platform  that was  once  the  site  of  two  ancient
 
bai.
 The  bai  is  68  feet  long,  20  feet  wide,  and  40  feet  high  at
 
its  apex.
 
We
 distribute
 copies
 of  the
 publication
 to
 them,
 take
 
pictures  with  our  cameras,
 and  begin  to play  Side  B of  the  tape.
 
The  old men  listen  intently  and  smile  tentatively.
 They begin  to
 
talk among  themselves,  trying  to  determine who  the  rubaks were  in
 
1936.
 One  old man  speaks,
 growing more  and more  excited.
 Tina
 
translates:
 "Hmmm.
 It  sounds  like  me.
 It  is!
 It  is  me!"
 The
 
old man,  named  Iyechad,  is  the  center  of  attention,  for  it  is  his
 
voice  singing  part  of  B-i  on  the  tape.
 The  men  present  are
 very
 
excited  for
 Iyechad.
 All  the  rubaks  talk now and  compare  notes.
 
They  recall  the  old  dictaphone machine
 "It was  just  like  one  of
 
those
 big old  fashioned  phonographs."
 Iyechad  recalls when
 the
 
Japanese  team of  scientists  came  to  Palau.
 Iyechad
 wears  a long
 
sleeved
 blue
 T-shirt  and  slacks.
 All  of  the  rubaks
 here
 are
 
bare-footed;
 they  left  their  zoris  outside  the  bai.
 Some  smoke
 
cigarettes.
 If  you  chew betel  nut  here,  you  can  spit  through  the
 
holes  in  the  floor.
 You  must  bend  over when  you  walk  inside  the
 
bai,

knees.
 
The  rubaks  recall  that  the  song  B-i  was  for a village  called
 
Iyebukel.
 They all  talk  together.
 Two  of  them wear  eyeglasses.
 
All
 seem  to wear watches.
 Iyechad  recalls  that maybe  20  or
 so
 
young
 men were  gathered  together while  he  sang his  solo
 portion
 
on
 the  tape.
 The  general  taping went  on  for many days,
 in  the
 
evenings  from  7:30  to  9 P. M.
 Iyechad  recognizes  some  of  the  old
 
men
 in
 the  pictures  in  the  publication.
 The
 young
 men
 were
 
invited
 to
 come  to  the  singing and  chanting  performance  by
 the
 
older men.
 The  older men  sent  out word  to  them by messenger
 so
 
they would  come  to  the  bai  for  the  taping.
 Belechel,  the  present
 
Chief,
 recalls  that  he was  here  on  those  evenings.
 Young women
 
were  present,  too,  the  rubaks  acknowledge with  smiles.
 
Iyechad
 recalls
 that
 the
 young men
 liked
 being
 called
 
together  for  such  occasions,
 because  then  they  could  look at  the
 
young women who were  milling  about.
 It was  enjoyable  and  fun  to
 
take  part  in  events  such  as  this.
 Young people  were  called upon
 
to
 sing  the  songs  appropriate  to  young  people.
 Older men
 sang
 
the  old  men's  songs.
 The  young men might  have  been  up  to  age
 35
 
then.
 They were  not  necessarily  single men.
 One  did  not  have  to
 
be  single  in order  to  be  a ±young man'.
 
Iyechad  is  71  now.
 Belechel  says  he  is  74.
 They  attended
 
the  German  elementary  school.
 Iyechad  can  remember  the  names  of
 
the  old men who  called  the  young men  to  sing  for  the  taping.
 The
 
young
 men's  songs
 had  newer words with  sometimes  a few Japanese
 
words
 included.
 Then  the  old men  of  those  days  sang  their
 old
 
men's  songs.
 An old man named  Simeon  sang  at  this  time.
 
After
 leaving
 the
 bai  at Airai,
 we  drove
 to
 the
 Palau
 
National
 Museum  in  the  district  center,
 Koror,
 where
 we
 met
 
museum assistant  Kempis  Mad.
 We  then  spoke with  the  Chief  of  the
 
Division  of  Cultural Affairs,
 Republic  of  Palau,
 Moses  Sam,  and
 
gave
 him
 a copy of  Call  o f th e Morn
ing  Bi r d.
 A dinner
 meeting
 
concerning  the  tapes was  held with Droteo  Nagata,  Director  of  the
 
Community
 Action
 Agency,
 and
 Roberta
 Louch,
 Food
 Services
 
Supervisor,
 Republic
 of  Palau.
 A copy  of  the  publication
 was
 
given  to  Droteo,  for  the  Community Action Agency.
 
September  13,  1985.
 
Research aide  Jeffrey Olegeriil  and  I flew to  Peleliu,
 a 25
 
minute  flight  from Koror,
 at  7:30 A.M.
 in  intermittent  rain.  At
 
Peleliu,
 driver  Noah Ongklungel  took us  to  the  community meeting
 
house  in  Klouklubad village.
 We  first met  Kulas
 Sengebau,
 the
 
Chairman  of  the  Cultural  Committee  for  Peleliu.  Local  people  have
 
been advised  that we  are  coming,  he  says.  A van  is making  several
 
stops
 around
 the  village,
 picking up  older people who wish
 to
 
attend
 this meeting.
 It  is  raining hard,
 so  they  come  in
 with
 
umbrellas  and  raincoats,
 looking  expectant.
 The  tapes  are  ready
 
for
 presentation
 to High  Chief  Obak whose
 name
 is
 Isao,
 the
 
second
 chief
 in
 rank  to  Obak named
 lederech,
 and
 the
 third
 
ranking
 chief
 of
 Ngerchol
 village.
 They
 look
 over
 the
 
ethnographic
 portions  of  the  publication  as  Side  B of
 the
 tape
 
1
1
 
starts
 to
 play.
 They  recognize  the women  on  the  left
 in
 the
 
photo  on page  45  in  the  text  -
 she  lives  nearby
 -
 they will  go
 
to  get  her.
 
A
 
The  community meeting house  is  a big modern  structure with  a
 
high
 sloping  roof,
 screens  on  all  sides,
 twelve  folding  chairs
 
set  up  in  the  center  of  the  room,  and  thirteen  desks  around  three
 
sides  of  it.
 As  the men  come  in,
 they  take  their places  at  the
 
desks.
 Women who  arrive  sit  on  the  folding  chairs  in  the  center
 
of  the  room.
 The  research  team is  seated  at  a head  table
 along
 
with Mr.  Sengebau.  Heavy  rain  persists.
 The women are  in Western
 
dress,
 with  zoris,
 gold  earrings,  and  some  are  wearing watches.
 
One  woman wears  glasses.
 The men  are  in T-shirts  or polo  shirts,
 
bermuda  shorts  and  zoris.
 The men visit  back  and  forth  from  the
 
little  desks where  they  seat  themselves.
 
The  women all  carry baskets.
 They  sit  on  the  folding  chairs
 
in  the  center  of  the  room and  look eager.
 The  men wear watches,
 
and
 I see  occasional wedding  rings.
 The  general  ambiance  is  so
 
modern.
 Another man  joins  the  group,  having  ridden up  on a small
 
motorcycle.
 A bell  is  rung  at  the  elementary  school  across
 the
 
way.
 Another
 van-load  of  people  arrive.
 Two men  appear with a
 
small  girl  in  tow.
 People  do  not  seem  to  chew betel  nut  as much
 
here
 as
 in
 Koror.
 Rebes,
 the
 Madrecholeb
 titleholder,
 has
 
arrived.
 His  is  a high  title.
 There  are  14  older  people
 here
 
now,
 and
 the
 one  child.
 It  is  rather  cold,
 because
 of
 the
 
intermittent
 rain.
 People wrap  their  arms  around  themselves  to
 
keep
 warm.
 The
 rain  coming  down makes  a lot  of noise
 on
 the
 
corrugated
 iron  roof.
 Betel  nut  baskets  here  are made
 smaller
 
than  on  Yap,  and  the  feathery  frond  part  does  not  extend  out  here
 
on  the  bottom,
 as  on  Yap.
 The  lady  in  the  picture,
 Ilecherong,
 
has  arrived;  she  is  wearing  an  orange  print  dress.
 A copy of  the
 
publication  is  given  to  her,  and  she  smiles  warmly.
 People  smile
 
-
 the
 chief
 looks
 at  his  copy
 -
 the  ladies
 share
 a  copy,
 
leaning
 together  so  that  each  one  can have  a  look.
 The
 chief
 
laughs.
 
One man  sings  along  in  an  undertone  with  the  tape.
 He  knows
 
this
 song.
 The  name  of  the  lead  singer  among  the  women on
 the
 
tape
 is
 Resiwal.
 She  is  in  Hawaii now.
 She  is  an  auntie
 to
 
Maria's  brother,  who  drove  the  truck  for us  when we  arrived.
 Her
 
other name  is  Ngrabliang.
 Now she  is married  to  a man with
 the
 
surname  of  Rideb.
 The  lady  on  the  lefthand  side  in  the
 picture
 
who  has  just  joined  us,
 Ilecherong,  had a twin  sister who  is  now
 
deceased.
 Is
 it  herself  in  the  picture  or  her  twin?
 The  seven
 
women  seated  together  debate  this  point
..
 Ilecherong  seems
 sure
 
that  it  is  herself.
 The  women  look over  the  old  pictures  in  the
 
publication.
 
The
 fourth  lady  on  the  right  in  the  photo,
 page  36  in
 the
 
publication,
 is  still  alive.
 She  is  married  to  a businessman  in
 
Koror.
 The
 lady
 who  is  3rd  from  the  left  in  the  photo  is
 from
 
Airai.
 The  men  sit  two  by  two  at  the  small  desks,  look over  the
 
old  pictures,
 and  laugh.
 Ilecherong  recalls  that  she  was  14  at
 
the  time  the  picture  was  taken.
 It  is  still  raining.
 The  tape
 
1
2
 
is  still  playing.
 
The  people  are  still  listening  intently.
 
Some  members  of  Maria  Otto's  family are  here.
 The  lady
 in 
the
 blue
 dress  is  a s is ter  to  Maria's mother.
 Maria's
 mother
 
died;
 the  lady  sitting  in  back with  short  hair married
 Maria's
 
father
 and
 became  Maria's  step-mother.
 Treked  is  the  name
 of
 
Maria's
 auntie.
 Her  stepmother  is  named
 Ngetbik.
 Ilecherong
 
points  to  page  45  and  says  in her best  English  to me,  "That  is me
 
picture."
 Mr.  Sengebau  corrects  her  gently,  "You  are  supposed  to
 
say,  that  is my picture."
 
Side
 A is  put  on of  the  Palauan  songs.
 The
 women
 listen
 
intently
 and  smile.
 Some  ladies  are wearing  long Hawaiian  style
 
muu-muus.
 Others wear  short  muu-muus.
 The  Chief  is  a  younger
 
man,  black hair,  wearing  a white  T shirt  and  a baseball  cap.
 Now
 
he
 takes
 his  copy of  the  publication  to  one  of  the
 women,
 and
 
asks
 her  some  questions  about  it.
 I reflect  on  the
 beauty
 of
 
Peleliu
 that
 I can  see  through  the  screened-in windows  in
 this
 
building.
 There
 are  not  many  tall  trees  in  this
 village,
 but
 
there  is  an open  and  airy  feeling  here.
 
The  lively  old man  born  in  1905  chides,
 "Too  bad  you  didn't
 
bring  a blank  tape with  you  this  time.
 The  ladies  are  here,  too,
 
you  know.
 We  could  sing  for you now,  to  save  it  for  the  future."
 
This
 is  Itaro  speaking,
 and  he  says  that  Maria  knows  him
 well.
 
Ilecherong,  a woman  of  Peleliu  by birth,  says  she
 has  a daughter
 
named  Sita  in  Hilo,  Hawaii,  married  to  Randy Parker.
 Maria knows
 
her
 very well,
 she  points  out.
 One  of  the  ladies  tells me  she
 
has  a daughter  named  Rebecca.
 11:45 A.M.
 It  is  time  to  go,  but
 
all
 present
 linger,
 in
 no
 hurry
 to
 disband
 the
 meeting,
 
particularly  Itaro,
 the  lively man,
 and  Ilecherong,  the  lady  in
 
the
 photo.
 The man  lekar  referred  as  the  performer  for  B-2
 on
 
the
 tape,
 page  45  in  the  publication,
 has  passed  away
 (passed
 
out,  they  say  locally).  At  the  time  of  the  taping,  he  was  already
 
old.
 Mr.Sengebau  remembers  the  two  coconut  trees  and  the  bai  on
 
Angaur
 as  pictured  on page  33  in  the  publication because  he
 was
 
there  in  1936.
 That  bai  is  no  longer  standing.
 Mr.  Sengebau  is
 
65
 years  old  now.
 His  uncle  owned  a store  at  Angaur.
 He
 had
 
been
 sent  to work  for  his  uncle.
 The  store  was  located
 behind
 
the  two  coconut  trees  that  one  can  see  in  the  picture.
 
Mr.  Sengebau  speaks  Japanese  very well.
 He went  to  Japanese
 
school  for  five  years,  but  never went  to  Japan.
 Three  years were
 
spent  here  at  Peleliu  in  Japanese  school,  and  then,  for  those who
 
qualified,  two  years  were  spent  in boarding  school  in Koror.
 Mr.
 
Sengebau
 knew  the  two  Japanese men mentioned  on page  18
 of
 the
 
publication,
 Mr.
 Rensicho
 and
 Mr.
 Kichita
 Shinozuka.
 Mr.
 
Shinozuka
 was
 married
 to
 a woman of Angaur
 -
 they
 have
 a
 
daughter.
 The
 daughter,
 Mayumi
 Shinozuka,
 still
 lives
 at
 
Peleliu  and  runs  a store  here.
 Shinozuka was  prospect  analyzing
 
for  a mining  company  at  Peleliu  before  going  to  Angaur.  Everybody
 
(all
 local
 people)
 were  sent  to
 Babeldaob
 during
 the
 heav y 
fighting  on  Peleliu  towar
ds th e en d o f Wor
ld  War  II.  
The
 U.S.S.
 
Peleliu  recently visited  the  island  that  gave  it  its  name  for  the
 
purpose
 of
 dedicating  a monument  to  those  who  took part  in
 the
 
1
3
 
battles
 that
 were
 fought
 on
 Bloody
 Nose
 Ridge.
 Tim
 Rock
 
described
 the
 event  in  a photo-essay  entitled  "The
 Marines
 at
 
Peleliu:
 Forty  Years  From D-Day"  in  Glimpses  of  Micronesia,  Vol.
 
24,
 No.
 4,
 1984,
 pp.
 52-55.  With  regard  to  Japanese  times  in
 
general,
 of  course,
 there  were  Japanese  ofuro  (hot  baths)
 here
 
during Japanese  times,
 said Mr.  Sengebau:  "The  Japanese hated  to
 
take
 showers
 in  cold water."
 Ngesias  was  the  center
 of
 Palau
 
then,
 the  school was  there  and  such.
 Now only  the  gate  of  that
 
old  school  remains  (and  Mr.  Sengebau  took us  to  see  it  before  our
 
plane  arrived  to  take us  back  to  Koror).
 
The
 air
 field
 on  Peleliu  is  at  Ngesias,
 and
 dates
 from
 
Japanese  times.
 G.I.'s  helped  enlarge  the  field  toward  the
 end
 
of
 the war.
 -
 There  were  small  trains  then  to move  the  phosphate
 
on Angaur.
 The  trains  are  still  there,  but  they  do not  run now.
 
A  sailing
 boat  could  easily  take  one  from Peleliu  to
 Koror
 in
 
those  days.
 When Mr.  Sengebau was  a student,  his  father used  to
 
hire  a canoe  to  take  him  to  Koror.
 School vacation was  orrly
 10
 
days  long.
 Japanese  school  in  each grade  lasted  for one
 year.
 
The
 Japanese  school was  not  so  hard,"  says  Mr.
 Sengebau with
 a
 
smile.
 Both boys  and  girls were  enrolled.
 There were  four main
 
schools,  in  Peleliu,  Angaur,  Melekeok,  and  Ngerchelong.
 Then  one
 
went
 to  Koror  to  finish  the  last  two  years  of  school.
 Not
 all
 
went  to  Koror,  only  those  who  had  passed  the  competitive  exam.
 
Mr.
 Sengebau
 was
 a  student
 at
 the
 Cultural
 Learning
 
Institute
 at  the  East-West  Center,
 University of  Hawaii,
 for  6
 
months  in  1975.  "If  only  I were  young,"  he  says,  "I would  go  back
 
to
 school
 in
 California."
 During  his  time
 at
 the
 East-West
 
Center,
 he  went  to Maui  on  the  hydrofoil,
 climbed Haleakala
 at
 
sunrise,  went  to  Alaska  (and  it  was  cold!),  and  to  San Francisco.
 
He
 had
 gone
 to  Japan when  he  was  16.
 His  uncle  sent
 him
 to
 
enroll
 in  a business  training  school  in  Japan.
 Maria Otto
 was
 
one
 of
 his
 former  students when he was
 a  school
 teacher
 at
 
Peleliu.
 He  recalls  that  she  was  a good  student.
 He  reminds  us
 
that
 Maria's
 younger brother,
 Noah Otto,
 also  known
 as
 Noah
 
Ongklungel,
 has  been  driving  us  around  in his  pickup  truck while
 
we  have  been at  Peleliu.
 
At
 Peleliu  there  are  tanks  at  the  homes  to  catch  freshwater
 
for
 drinking.
 There
 are  wells  that  can be  used  for
 taking
 a
 
shower.
 There
 is  also  a big  public  tank near  to
 the
 airport.
 
Made
 of  concrete,
 water  is  piped  from  there  through underground
 
pipes  into  a holding  tank and  then  into  the homes.
 But,  says  Mr.
 
Sengebau,
 the
 big
 tanks  leak now.
 A tank at  the
 home
 of
 a
 
research
 informant  for  this  project  on  Peleliu  is  part  of  an old
 
barge
 or
 landing  craft.
 It  holds  between  300-350
 gallons
 of
 
rainwater.
 
There
 are
 some  800  people  at  Peleliu
 now,
 we
 are
 told.
 
School
 is
 taught  through  the  8th  grade  level.
 But  there  is
 a
 
plan  to  build  a high  school  here.
 Planning  is  already
 underway
 
for
 a first  anniversary memorial  for  an  old man who  died.
 When
 
the  recording  took place,
 the  old man was  a chief  of  the
 hamlet
 
Ngasias.
 There
 is
 a dispensary  here  at  Peleliu  but  no
 nurse.
 
r

There  are  16  states  in  the  Republic  of  Palau,  and  budget  problems
 
are  great.
 The  electric  power  in Peleliu  is  on  from  6 P.M.  until
 
midnight,
 to  conserve  on  fuel  and  expenses.
 Many people  do have
 
videotape  r
-ecorders  here;
 some  are  rented  from Koror.
 There  are
 
no
 hotels
 on  Peleliu,
 and  no  restaurants.
 There  are
 about
 6
 
retail  stores.
 Most  people  fish and  grow  taro  and  tapioca.
 Pigs
 
are  kept  per household.
 Sometimes  a Palauan would  sell  a pig  to
 
raise money.
 Many people  are  jobless here;
 everyone needs more
 
money.
 People
 can
 sell
 fish
 to
 Koror,
 as
 two
 boats
 are
 
available,  one  owned by  the  government  and  one  by  the  Fishing  Co-
op.
 Ladies might weave  for  a community  fair,  but  otherwise  they
 
weave
 for
 their
 own uses.
 Men
 carve
 storyboards
 and
 make
 
turtleshell
 things.
 There  is  a lack of materials  to  knot  a big
 
fishnet,
 but  the men  can patch old  ones.
 A lot  of materials  and
 
time  is  needed  to make  a big  fishing net.
 There  are  140  students
 
in
 the
 elementary  school  this  year.
 There  are
 four
 churches
 
here,  Catholic,  Protestant,  Seventh Day Adventist,  and Modekngei,
 
the  local  religion.
 Ngasech  (a  Palauan ritual honoring  a woman
 
when
 she
 has  given birth)  is  held  here  for  a  firstborn
 child.
 
When household-building  occurs,
 all must  help  pay  for  the  ±house
 
party.'
 Adoption  is  the  custom here.
 Adopted  parents  have
 to
 
±fill
 her
 purse'
 so
 a  sister
 can
 help
 her
 brother
 with
 
fundraising  to  build  a house.  Then  she  can  come  to  the  gathering,
 
says  Robert  Kintol,  the  "acting  governor"  of  Peleliu.
 
September  14,  1985.
 
Kempis
 Mad
 of  the  Palau  National Museum accompanied me
 to
 
Melekeok,
 because  it  is  his  home  village.
 Access  to Melekeok  is
 
by boat  only,  about  an hour's  time  from Koror.
 Kempis  and  I were
 
passengers
 on  a small  open boat  with  an  outboard motor  that
 had
 
been
 rented
 for
 our use  ( I paid  for  the
 gas).
 We
 met
 the
 
Paramount  High  Chief  of Melekeok,
 Reklai  Siangeldeb  Basilius
 at
 
the
 Community
 Meeting
 House
 as  well
 as
 Thomas
 Tellei,
 the
 
Governor  of Melekeok at  about  9:30 A. M.
 A number  of  people
 had
 
gathered  together  because  of  our  arrival,  and we  put  on  the  tape.
 
They  listen  intently  to  the  song  about  the war  canoe,  A-2  on page
 
22  of  the  publication.
 They  chant  the words  along with  the  tape,
 
smiling
 all
 the
 while.
 Kempis  translates  that  they
 say
 the
 
traditional war  canoe  was  turned  into  a racing  canoe  in
 Japanese
 
times.
 Four  older men are  here  now,
 one  middle  aged woman,  and
 
three
 younger
 men.
 Occasional
 children
 appear
 and
 listen
 
briefly,
 before  continuing  on with  their  games  on  the  road.
 It
 
has
 stopped  raining momentarily.
 A well-formed new tar
 sealed
 
road  is  being  built  at  the  front  of  the village,  beach-side.
 The
 
meeting
 house we  are  at  fronts  along  the  road.
 One  younger man
 
wears  glasses  and  also  the  lady,
 along with gold  earrings.
 The
 
people  are  in  casual Western dress  and  zoris.
 One  younger man  is
 
in a wheelchair,  but  I never  did hear what  his  ailment was.
 
The  listeners  recognize  the  voice  of  the  performer Otang
 in
 
Item A-8  on page  27  of  the  publication.
 They  read  the words  on
 
the
 printed
 page,
 and  smile  at  the women's  high voices  on
 the
 
tape;
 they
 laugh.
 Mr.
 Tellei  sings  along with
 the
 women's
 
voices  on  the  tape.
 He  says  he  can  remember  this  song  from back
 
when  he  was  a teen-ager.
 For A-li,  they  tell me,  the  performer's
 
1
5
 
name
 should
 read  as  lu  or  Iiu,
 and  not  Yu.
 The woman's
 name
 
listed  on A-12  should  be  Limasang,
 not  Nimasang,
 the y tell
 me.
 
Limasang  lives  in  Koro r now
.  We can
 ca
ll  on  her  there  when we  go
 
back.
 The  Paramount  High  Chief  sings  along with A-12  and  also A-
13.
 At  A-14,  some  of  the  spelling here  needs  to  be  changed,  I am
 
told.
 Another
 woman
 joins  the  group,
 a younger
 woman.
 The
 
Paramount
 High
 Chief  continues  to  sing  along  quietly
 with
 the
 
tape.
 The  young  children are  curious;
 they gather around
 and
 
look
 at
 the
 publication,
 asking
 who  the  people
 are
 in
 the
 
photographs.
 They all  laugh,  especially  the  chief.
 On page  39,
 
the  photo  on  the  right  is  of  the  Meketii  bai,
 they  say,
 not  the
 
bai  at  Koror.
 The man  on  page  47 with  the  canoe  is  Gustap,
 they
 
announce,
 also
 known as Ng ire
tii  (a t it le name
) or  
Ngiraikelau
 
(another
 of
 his  titles).
 One  of  the  older men
 in
 the
 grou
 
reflects
 that  when  he was  a teenager,
 he  did not  spend  too muc
 
time  listening  to  the  old men's  songs.
 Now 61  or  62,
 he
 note'
 
that
 back
 in
 1936
 he  was  busy  chasing  girls
 in
 between
 the
 
houses.
 His  comment  provokes much appreciative  laughter  from the
 
assembled
 crowd.
 The
 people  here  explain  that  they
 know
 the
 
composers  of  these  songs,  and  they know  the  reasons why  the  songs
 
were  created.
 Sometimes,  the  say,  people  chanted  at  a funeral,
 
or
 at  a social  gathering.
 There  used  to  be  a  traditional
 bai
 
here,
 where
 the
 concrete
 block community
 meeting
 house
 now
 
stands.
 Each
 man
 knew
 where  his window
 was,
 where
 he
 was
-
supposed  to  sit.
 The  traditional  way was  to  sing  the  chants  back
 
and  forth,
 between  two  groups  of  singers.
 Sometimes  the  singers
 
would
 create  a song on  the  spot.
 They may be  trying  to
 deface
 
someone
 in  the  audience.
 The  old men will  laugh  as  they
 sing;
 
it's  a joke  that  they  share  back and  forth.
 
Now,  it  is  not  convenient  to  build  a traditional  bai.
 It  is
 
a  lot
 of
 work
 to  climb  up  into  the  hills  to
 get
 the
 proper
 
materials
 from  the  land  needed  to  build  a traditional
 bai,
 and
 
then  bring  those materials  down  into  the  village.
 It  is
 easier
 
just  to  buy  concrete  blocks  or mix  ceme n t.
 It  costs  less,
 they
 
say  in  terms  of  labor  output.
 There  have  been no  real  bad  storms
 
here
 since  the  1900's  that  they  can
 recall.
 However,
 Typhoon
 
Sally  in  1967  was  quite  major.
 Tin and  nails  rust  here  quickly,
 
because  the  village  is  located  on  the  sea  coast,
 and  then become
 
weak and  break apart.
 The  humidity,
 the  salt water  in  the  air,
 
all  of  these  cause  rust  on vehicles  and  on  houses  built  of  tin  or
 
corrugated
 iron.
 If
 a  community meeting  house
 is
 built
 of
 
contemporary
 materials,
 it will  rust  quickly,
 and  the  roof may
 
blow
 off
 in
 a bad  storm.
 The  traditional bai
 were
 made
 to
 
withstand  high winds
 -
 they had  give  or  ease  as  a part  of  their
 
construction.
 Maybe  the  traditional  bai were  better,  after  all,
 
the men  conclude  thoughtfully.
 
There  are  about  40  households  in Helekeok,
 about  10
 people
 
per  household.
 There  is  one  school,
 grades  1-8,
 with about  60
 
young
 people  enrolled.
 One  dispensary  is  located  here,
 and
 a
 
nurse  is  stationed  in  this  village.
 There  are  3 video  sets  here.
 
Generators  are  here,
 some  are  privately  owned  and  some  belong  to
 
the
 government.
 An
 ice  machine  is  here.
 There  are
 4  small
 
stores.
 Two
 churches  are  located  in  this  village,
 a  Catholic
 
a
  
r
 
1
6
 
church
 and
 a  Protestant  church.
 The
 Seventh
 Day
 Adventist
 
religious
 personnel  come  sometimes  and  hold meetings  in
 private
 
homes.
 There  are  about  4 inboard  diesel  boats  owned  locally,  and
 
about
 10
 outboard motor  boats  that  are
 privately
 owned.
 The
 
state
 of  the weather  determines  how long  it will  take  to  get
 to
 
Koror
 -
 it  takes  three  hours  on  a "putput" motor  boat.
 There
 
is  an  airport  here  with  a dirt  runway;
 small planes  used  to  fly
 
in,
 before.
 Melekeok people  are  seeking a type  of public  water
 
transport.
 A big privately owned  passenger boat  makes  the  round
 
trip  to Melekeok on  Saturday,
 and  goes  back  to  Koror on
 Sunday.
 
You
 can
 sit  indoors  out  of  the  rain on  this  boat,
 and  beer
 is
 
served  on board.
 Local people  in Melekeok make  coconut  oil
 for
 
sale  sometimes,
 hats,  baskets  and mats.
 Some  are  only  for  local
 
use.
 One  young man here  makes  story boards.
 (But  none  of  these
 
handicrafts  are  brought  to me  for my  inspection  or purchase).
 In
 
Angaur,
 the  people  here  say,  a platform  is  still  erected  for  the
 
woman
 to
 climb  up when her  ngasech  is  celebrated
 (first
 child
 
birthing
 ceremony).
 There
 are
 about
 6-8
 music
 tapes
 of
 
contemporary Palauan music  that  one  can buy  in  the  stores  locally
 
now.
 Most  of  the  taping  is  done  in  the  Philippines.
 
Kempis
 took
 me  on a walk down  the  new  tar  sealed
 road
 to
 
meet
 some
 of
 his  family members.
 As we  returned we
 saw
 one
 
family
 enjoying
 the  cool  breezes  on  their verandah
 at
 midday,
 
listening  to  a tape  recorder
 -
 yes,
 it was  Call  of  the  Morning
 
Bird  Songs  that  were  playing,
 and  the  book was  being  studied
 by
 
several  people who  had  their  heads  bent  over  the  pages.
 
It
 was  a very  rainy  trip  back  to  Koror.
 We were  drenched.
 
In  fact,
 the  boat  had  to  pull  over near  to  a little  cave  in
 one
 
of
 the
 Rock Islands,
 and we  sat  there  in  the  cave  for
 awhile,
 
waiting  for  the  rain  to  ease  up.
 The man  driving  the  boat  could
 
not
 see  where  to  take  the  cuts  between  the  Rock  Islands  back
 to
 
Koror  because  it  was  raining  so  hard.
 
September  15,  1985.
 
Today  Kempis  accompanied  me  to  Ngeremlengui,
 one  half
 hour
 
by boat  from Koror.
 As we  boarded  the  boat,  we met  State  Senator
 
for
 Ngeremlengui,
 April  Olkeriil,
 and he  talked me  out  of
 one
 
copy  of  Call  of  the  Morning Bird.  It  rained  again  some  on  the way
 
over.
 We
 stopped  to  see  Ibobang  School,
 founded  in  1974  as
 a
 
joint
 venture
 by
 the  local Modekngei  religion
 and
 the
 Janss
 
Foundation  of  California.
 The  school  emphasizes  the  learning  of
 
Palauan
 culture
 utilizing
 local
 resources,
 as
 well
 as
 the
 
teaching  of  academic  subjects.
 
We
 called  on  the  chief  of  Ngeremlengui  in his  home  at
 9:10
 
A.M.
 His  name  is  Lawrence  Otaor,  his  title  is Ngirturong,  and  he
 
is  the  principal  chief  of  this village.
 He  is  shirtless,  wearing
 
green
 checked  Bermuda  shorts,
 sitting  in  a wheelchair  (I
 never
 
did  find  out  what  his  ailment  is).
 We  play  the  tape  first  of  all
 
for  him.  We  discover  together  that  he  is  the  same  Lawrence  who  is
 
listed
 as
 a singer  for A-19  on  the  tape.
 A number
 of
 family
 
members  are  also here,
 his  wife,
 young men  and women,
 and  some
 
small
 children.
 He  explains  to  all  of  us  the  kind  of  song  that
 
was  used  for  a canoe  race,
 such  as A-2,
 page  22.
 He  recognizes
 
it.
 If  this  song  is  sung,  it  helps  the  paddlers  to  paddle  well.
 
This  village  is  inland,
 along a mangrove  swamp.
 A kind  of
 
quay,
 built  up  of  heavy  stones,
 fronts  the water's  edge,  giving
 
it
 the  effect  of  a canal  (from German  times?).
 Many boats
 are
 
tied
 up
 along
 the  canal.
 Young men  are  sitting
 in
 an
 open
 
shelter  that  serves  as  a rest  stop.
 Singing  is  heard  from across
 
the  way:  there  is  a Sunday morning  church  service  taking  place  in
 
the Meeting House.
 
Lawrence,
 the
 chief,
 listens
 to
 the
 tape
 intently,
 
particularly
 songs A-8  and A-9  on  page  27.
 He  remembers
 the
 
man Yu mentioned  as  the  performer  in A-9,  but  the  spelling of  the
 
name
 may
 be  lu  or  Iiu  or U.
 In  fact,
 the  brother  of  that
 Yu
 
lives
 next
 door.
 The  brother  is  sent
 for.
 This
 house
 has
 
electricity.
 There  is  a big  freezer  in  the  kitchen  area where we
 
sit.
 Utilitarian woven  baskets  are  everywhere.
 The  chief hums
 
along
 with
 one  of  the  songs.
 The woman,
 Limasang,
 is
 again
 
identified;
 she  sang  in A-12  and  her name  is  shown  as  Nimasang.
 
We
 can  call  on her  in Koror.
 In
 A-13,
 Semang,
 identified
 as
 
Sisang
 in  the  booklet,
 is  the  husband  of Limasang,
 but  he
 has
 
passed  out  (sic),
 i.e.,
 passed  away.
 Yu's brother  has  come  in
 
now;
 a  younger
 man,
 he
 is  a  school
 teacher.
 He
 listens
 
curiously
 to
 his
 brother's  voice.
 Chief
 Lawrence
 remembers
 
seeing  Otang,
 mentioned  in A-lA.
 Otang,  he  recalls,  had  a long
 
beard.
 One
 child  has  joined us,
 a 1itt1e
 girl.
 She
 slowly
 
reaches
 for  the  plastic  sack  of  Tootsie  Pops  that  I pass  to her.
 
Large
 liquid  brown  eyes  regard me  very  solemnly.
 Kempis  and
 I
 
are  served  coffee.
 
In  song A-19,  this  is  Lawrence  himself  singing!
 He  has  been
 
the
 only  one  in  this  village  by  the  name  of  Lawrence  for  a  long
 
time.
 It  is  his  own  name,
 and  he  recognizes  his  own voice.
 He
 
now
 recalls
 the
 house
 where
 the
 singing
 took
 place.
 He
 
recognizes  the  Dictaphone  in  the  picture  on page  10,
 because
 it
 
sat
 in
 front
 of  them as  they  sang.
 His  face  lights
 up
 with
 
recollections.
 He  is  70  now.
 He was  young .
then.
 The
 taping
 
took place  in  the  evening.
 On  page  27,  one  of  the  performers  in
 
the  picture  is  identified  as  a man who works  for  the  Palau Museum
 
now.
 Chief
 Lawrence  looks  bemused.
 The  tot  walks  slowly
 off
 
with  the  Tootsie  Pops,
 calling  to  her  friends,
 the  unknown  lady
 
who gave  them  to her  forgotten.
 
Concerning A-23,  page  38,  we  can  talk  to  one  of  those  ladies
 
who  sang  this  song,  also.
 The  man  from Ngerchelong  is  a mar
. Tina
 
Rehuher's
 mother will  recognize,
 the  old man with  the  ax  in  the
 
photo  on page  41.
 Church  singing  is  heard now as  a backdrop
 to
 
our
 animated  conversation.
 Chief  Lawrence  recognizes  a man
 in
 
the
 center  of  the  group  of  men  in  the  photo  on page
 27.
 Also,
 
the  Chief  can  recognize  who  carved  the  story boards  in  the  photos
 
on
 page
 20 because  of  the  style  of  the  carvings.
 In
 B-1,
 the
 
singer  is  Iyechad,
 we  are  told.
 We  met  him  in Airai;
 this  is  a
 
reconfirmation of  that  identification.
 The  Chief  smiles  broadly
 
at
 the  photo  of  the  old  man  with  the  canoe  on  page  47;
 he
 is
 
i
b
 
the
 father
 of
 Italbang,
 and  his
 name
 is
 Luii,
 says
 Chief
 
Lawrence.
 Lull has  passed  away,
 but  we  can  call  on  Italbang  in
 
Koror;
 Italbang  is  a politician.
 
There
 is
 no  bai  in  this  village,
 but  there  was
 one
 here
 
before.
 The  one  on  the  right  in  the  photo  on page  39,  identified
 
as
 a  Koror bai,
 there  is  a concrete  state  building  standing  in
 
that
 place  now where  the  bai  stood before.
 Many of  the
 really
 
old people  live  in Koror now,  in order  to  be near  to  the hospital
 
and medical  treatment,
 we  are  told.
 One  older  person  from
 this
 
village,  for  example,  that we  might  otherwise  call  on  is  in  Koror
 
now.
 
Most
 of
 the  women  and  girls  here wear  a piece
 of
 Palauan
 
money
 on
 a  cord  around  their neck.
 A black  cord  is
 seen
 on
 
women,
 and  a red  cord  on  a young  girl.
 This  seems  to  be  Palau's
 
answer  to Guam's  baht  chains.
 A lady  stops by  to  call  on
 Chief
 
Lawrence,
 an older  lady with grey hair.
 She wants  to  send  some
 
packages  on our boat  going  to Koror.
 Chief Lawrence  says,  isn't
 
it
 wonderful  that  the  tape  of  the voices  could  be  preserved
 all
 
these  years.
 Chief  Lawrence wants  to  know why we  cannot  tape  the
 
people
 singing  and  chanting now,
 to  save  the  words  of  this  time
 
for
 another  50  years.
 This  author
 promises  to pass  along
 the
 
request  to  Betty Tatar  and  Bess  Hawes.
 Now that  church  is  over,
 
other
 people
 have  come  home  and  are  looking  at
 the
 book
 and
 
listening
 to  the  tape.
 We walk to  the  site  of  the  old
 private
 
house
 (no  longer  standing)  where  the  original  taping was  done  in
 
this  village  in  1936.
 Perhaps  it was  done  in  this  house  because
 
Yu,
 a leading  singer  and  chanter  identified  for  the  Ngeremlengui
 
songs,  lived  in  the  house  behind  the  house  no  longer  standing.
 
It
 is  about  noon,
 and  time  to  return  to
 Koror.
 We
 have
 
picked
 up
 some  passengers;
 eight  people will  be  going back
 to
 
Koror,
 including  a little  baby,
 and  the  two  boatmen.
 We  start
 
out  in  fine  weather,  but  then  it  rains  again
 -
 and  rains
 -
 we
 
are
 drenched
 -
 the
 baby  cries  for  awhile
 and
 then
 huddles
 
against  its  mother  in wet misery.
 We  dock at  Koror  and wring  out
 
our  clothing  by hand.
 I buy  soda  pop  for  the  ladies  and  children
 
on
 board,
 and
 beer
 for  the
 men.
 They
 accept
 my
 offering
 
gratefully.
 
After  a change  of  clothes,
 at  3 P.M.  we  call  in at  the  home
 
of
 Senator  Italbang.
 He  is  sorry,
 but  that  is  not  his
 father
 
Luii  in  the  picture  on  page  47,
 he  says.
 Rather,  the  picture  is
 
of  Ngiraikelau  Salli.
 His  other  name  is  Gustay.
 It  seems  proper
 
to  give  Italbang  a copy of  the  publication.
 
Tina  Rehuher's mother,
 Kiarii,
 says  the man with  the  ax  in
 
the
 photo
 on
 page
 41  is  Kedelaol.
 We  then
 call
 on
 Rotnana
 
Anastacio,
 a woman of  age  40 or  so,  the Director  of  the  Language
 
Program,
 Department  of  Education,
 Government  of  Palau.
 She  is
 
very  enthusiastic,
 and  pleased  to  receive  a copy  of  Call  of
 the
 
Morning  Bird.
 
At
 6:30
 P.M.,
 we  call  in  at  the  home  of  the  lady we
 have
 
1
9
 
been  referred  to  in Ngeremlengui,  the  lady whose  name  is  given  as
 
one  of  the  singers  in  the  publication  for A-12,
 page  30.
 She  is
 
Limasang,
 spelled  Nimasang  in  the  publication.
 She  listens
 to
 
Kempis'
 description
 of
 why we  have  come  with
 rapt
 attention.
 
When  shown  the  photos  in  the  publication,  she  smiles  broadly upon
 
seeing  the  dictaphone.
 Oh,
 yes,
 she  recalls  singing  into  that
 
machine.
 You  had  to move  very  close  to  the machine when  it
 was
 
your  turn  to  sing,  she  recalls.
 We  put  on  the  tape.
 She  listens
 
intently,
 smiles  tentatively,
 and  then  smiles  a far away  smile.
 
For A-12,
 yes,
 she  recalls  performing  that  song,
 and  she  sings
 
along
 in  an undertone with  the  tape.
 Other women,
 some
 older
 
women
 and  some  youthful,
 materialize  from the  back of  the house
 
and  sit  on  the  floor around  her  in  curiosity.
 What  is  this
 all
 
about?
 A  drunk
 young
 man wanders  in and  speaks
 in
 English,
 
asking
 about
 the  tape  and  the visitors.
 All
 ignore
 him
 and
 
Limasang  continues  her  reverie.
 In response  to my question,  she
 
says
 that  she  is  70  years  old  (Kempis  translates),
 but  she  does
 
not  look it.
 Her hair  is  dark,
 not  a trace  of grey.
 She  looks
 
pleased when Kempis  shares with her my  compliment.
 
Kathy Kesolei,
 currently  serving  as  Principal  of
 Mindzenty
 
High
 School,
 joins
 us  for  dinner  and  is  given her  copy of
 the
 
publication.
 She  says  she  will use  it  as  a teaching aid  in
 her
 
class
 the
 very
 next
 day,
 and  anticipates
 a  high
 level
 of
 
interested  response  on  the  part  of  the  high  school  students.
 
September  16,  1985.
 
I meet  Tina  Rehuher  at  8:30 A.M.
 in her  office  at  the  Palau
 
National Museum.
 We  two  have  an  appointment  at  9 A.M.  to  call  on
 
Ibedul
 Yutaka  Gibbons,
 the  Chief  of  Koror  State.
 Because
 his
 
traditional  rank  is  so high,
 Tina  explains,
 most  of his  time  is
 
taken
 up
 with
 matters  pertaining  to  the
 chiefly
 business
 of
 
Koror.
 In  fact,  he  is  not  available  to  see us,  but we meet  with
 
his
 younger
 brother,
 Johnny
 Gibbons,
 who
 serves
 as
 the
 
Administrative  Officer  for Koror.
 Johnny  is  a man  of  30  or
 so,
 
stateside-educated,
 well-spoken,
 but
 only  recently returned  to
 
Palau
 from
 the  U.S.A.
 Nonetheless,
 he  is  fascinated
 by
 our
 
description
 of  the  Call  of  the  Morning  Bird
 project,
 and
 will
 
bring
 it
 to his  brother's  attention.
 A copy  is  left
 for
 the
 
Ibedul,  with Johnny's  thanks.
 
We  then  call  on Dr.  Minoru  Ueki,  Minister  of  Social  Services
 
for  the  Republic  of  Palau,  and  Tina  Rehuher's  boss.
 Dr.  Ueki was
 
a  young man at  the  time  of  the  original project,
 but  he  is
 old
 
enough
 now  (50's)  to  really  appreciate  the  history and  tradition
 
that  the  project  brings  back  to  Palau.
 He  receives  his  copy
 of
 
the  publication with gratitude.
 
Tina
 and  I visit  Chief  Esebei Arbedul,
 title  ranking
 name
 
Esbangel,
 in his home  at  Ngarkabesang.
 This  is  the  last  village
 
indicated
 in  Palau where  original  taping was  done.
 This
 Chief,
 
when
 shown
 the  picture  on  page  7,
 remembers
 Muranushi.
 Tina
 
translates
 that
 he
 says  the  publication
 reminds
 him
 of
 the
 
importance
 of
 his
 heritage
 and
 culture.
 Looking
 at
 this
 
publication
 will  help  him  recall more  of  the  past.
 We
 present
 
20
 
four
 copies  of  the  publication  for  himself  and  others
 he  wishes
 
to  share with.
 
Knowledge
 now,
 Chief  Esebei  reflects,
 is  like
 high
 tide.
 
Modern  knowledge,
 like  high  tide,
 may  cover  the  past,  i.e.,  the
 
sand  and  shells,
 and  the  low tide mark.
 But  books  like  this  and
 
the
 photos
 insure  that  one's  identity  is  not  lost  by
 the
 high
 
tide.
 Kids  now,
 he  says,  look  toward  the  other  side  and  forget
 
the
 past.
 Crime  follows  now because  of modern  influences.
 Is
 
this
 new
 knowledge  going  in a positive  or
 negative
 direction?
 
Before,  Palau was  Palauan.  One must  not  forget  your beginning and
 
your  country.
 It was  island  style  then,  but  now the  influence  is
 
from
 Japan  and  the  U.S.
 Mainland,
 more  of  a continental
 view.
 
There  is  a need  to weave  these new  learned ways  together,
 a need
 
to
 keep  these working hand  in hand.
 We  cannot  forget
 our
 own
 
Palauan-ness,
 says
 Chief
 Esebei,
 but
 we
 cannot
 disregard
 
modernization because  it  is  happening  anyway.
 This  Chief went  to
 
Japanese
 school.
 There was  a big  difference  then,
 only 40%  to
 
50%
 of
 the  potential  students
 were
 enrolled.
 Now,
 American
 
style,
 there  is  a 100%  enrollment  of  potential  students.
 Before
 
you
 went
 from
 1-3  years,
 then  for
 two
 years
 of
 vocational
 
training.
 Now the  knowledge  is  higher
 -
 like  high  tide  coming
 
in
 -
 bringing
 different  knowledge  from
 the
 U.S.A.
 Before,
 
Palauans  did not  go  off  island  to  Japanese  school.
 Traditionally
 
Palau
 was
 peaceful.
 The  clan  system and  social  structure
 was
 
well  defined.
 It was  peaceful  then.
 Today Palau  is  different.
 
The  democratic  system now is  good  and  bad.
 As  shown  in political
 
campaigns,  it  divides  the  people now.
 It  is  an  introduced  system
 
now.
 Traditionally,
 Palau
 was  socialist,
 really;
 there
 was
 
structure  then,  but
 not  now.
 
Chief  Esebei wishes  old  ways  and new would  blend  to  get
 the
 
best
 of  both.
 But  that's  hard.
 But  we must  try  to  blend
 the
 
two,
 he  says.
 Then  it would be  utopia,
 but  that  can't  be  done.
 
He
 wishes  that  it  would  happen,
 but  it  is  hard  to  achieve.
 He
 
stresses
 the  importance  of  cultural  identity as  he  thinks
 about
 
the  past  as  demonstrated  in  the  publication we  have  brought
 him.
 
He
 is  75  years  old,
 born  October  11,
 1908.
 He was  physically
 
active
 when young.
 He  is  Tina  Rehuher's  uncle.
 The
 2  clans
 
represented
 by his  side  and  Tina's  side  could  interchange  chiefs
 
(Nchulang)  if  need  be,  if  no  chief was  available  in  one  clan.
 
Chief
 Esebei  laughs  when we  put  on  the  tape.
 He  nods
 his
 
head.
 He  laughs  heartily.
 He  acknowledges  the  song  about
 the
 
war  canoe,  A-2,  page  22.
 In  the  song are  the  different  calls  you
 
give
 when
 you
 pull
 the  canoe  or  push  it.
 He
 himself
 is
 a
 
composer.
 He
 has  written  songs  about  events,
 as
 people
 have
 
requested
 him to  do  that.
 He  laughs when we  switch  the  tape  to
 
Side
 B.
 He
 nods  his  head  on hearing  the  songs  and
 chants
 of
 
Peleliu  and  chuckles.  At  B-4,  he  chuckles.
 He  recognizes  it  as  a
 
song
 of
 Ngarkabesang.
 Some
 of
 the
 words,
 after
 all,
 are
 
humorous,
 being  found  in  old  love  songs  such  as  these.
 At  B-5,
 
he  listens
 intently.
 On  hearing  B-6,
 he  nods.
 These  songs  are
 
for
 rubak
 (elderly people)  at  the  village  level  and
 above
 the
 
village  level.
 For
 B-7,
 he  says  the  singer  sounds  like  Santos
 
2
1
 
'4
 
Ngodrii,
 the  title  name  Ngratu
iarikel.
 This  man was  known  as
 a
 
good  singer.
 Also,
 he  had  something  to  do with  the museum  that
 
was
 at  Palau  during  Japanese  times.
 It might  be  Santos  singing
 
instead  of  Olkeriil.
 Santos  knew chants  and  chanting very well.
 
Olkeriil  did not  know chanting  so well.
 Chief  Esebei  thinks  the
 
Japanese
 team headed  by Muranushi  recorded  samples  of  songs
 and
 
chants  in  each  significant  area  of  Palau
 -
 the  West  Coast,
 the
 
East  Coast,  the  south and  the  central area.
 
In  the  late  afternoon,
 Tina and  I speak of  how well  things
 have
 
gone  before  I leave  for  the  airport.
 Tina  and  Kathy  Kesolei  see
 
me  onto my plane  for  an  evening  flight  back  to  Guam.
 
PONAPE
 
September  26,  1985
 
I  leave
 Guam  for  Ponape  about  3 P.M.
 It  is  about  8  P M
 
when  the  plane  arrives  at  Ponape.
 My welcoming  committee  is  Iris
 
Falcam,
 Chief
 Librarian  at  the  College  of
 Micronesia;
 Pensile
 
Lawrence,
 Historic
 Preservation
 Office;
 and
 Eve
 Pinsker,
 a
 
doctoral  candidate  in Anthropology  from  the  University of  Chicago
 
who
 is
 doing  doctoral  dissertation
 field
 research
 concerning
 
political
 change
 on Ponape.
 I have met  Eve
 before.
 Pensile
 
drives  Eve  and me  into  Kolonia  to  the  Pohnpei Hotel.
 Iris  leaves
 
separately;
 she
 says  she will  see  us  tomorrow.
 Eve
 is
 being
 
hosted
 by
 Pensile's
 family
 during  the
 course
 of
 her
 field
 
research,
 and  they  live  right  across  the  street  from  the  Pohnpei
 
Hotel.
 I  talk
 Eve
 and  Pensile  into  going
 out
 for
 sashimi.
 
Pensile  finally begins  to  open up  a little,
 and  I recognize  that
 
he
 has  known  and worked with  every other anthropologist who
 has
 
ever worked  on  Ponape  since  the  end  of  World  War  II.
 Pensile  is
 
a valuable  reference  person.
 
September  27,  1985.
 
It will  be  a very  busy  day of  calling on  key  government  people  in
 
the
 district  center of  Kolonia.
 Pensile  and  Eve  will  accompany
 
me.
 We
 were
 scheduled
 to  call
 on
 Mr.
 Hers
 Tesei,
 Acting
 
President
 of  the  Community  College  of Micronesia at
 8:15
 A.M.,
 
but
 there
 is  a change  of  plans,
 as  he  is  not
 available.
 Our
 
first  call,
 therefore,
 is  on  the  Director  of  the  Pohnpei
 State
 
Education
 Department,
 Mr.
 Damian  Sohl,
 at  9  A.M.
 Mr.
 Sohl
 
receives
 his  copy of  the  publication with  great  enthusiasm,
 and
 
he
 looks
 it
 over with  keen  interest.
 In  the
 course
 of
 our
 
conversation,
 the
 close-up
 photo
 of  the man
 on
 page
 56
 is
 
identified  by Pensile  Lawrence  as  the
 former Nahnken  ( principal
 
chief,
 second  line)  of  Kiti municipality,
 Heinrich  Stephen.
 He
 
died  about  two  years  ago.
 Damian  Sohl  is very  surprised  and very
 
interested,
 as  he  only knew  this man  as  a much older man.
 "What
 
are
 those
 marks
 on his  chest?"  he  wants  to
 know.
 "Don't
 you
 
know?"  laughs  Pensile.
 "It  is  a part  of  our  culture.
 That
 is
 
the
 way men used  to  decorate  their  skin  in  the  old  days.
 It  is
 
like
 a  tatoo,
 permanent  cuts  into  the  skin  that
 leave
 raised
 
scars."  "We  never  saw  it  on  the  Nankin," muses  Damian
 Sohl.
 "Of
 
course
 not,"  says  Pensile.
 "As  an old man,
 he  always  kept
 his
 
shirt
 on."
 In  the  picture  of  the  Koben Mori  family on page
 13,
 
Pensile
 and
 Damian
 identify  the  woman  on  the
 left
 as
 Toyoko
 
22
 
Narrun,
 wife
 of
 the
 late
 Robert
 Narrun.
 That
 man
 was
 
Mortlockese.
 Her  son now  travels  around.
 The  grandfather
 was
 
Alex Narrun,
 the  oldest  son  of  the  first  Narrun,
 a seaman,  said
 
to  be  from  the  U.S.A.
 or  Ireland.
 "There  are many  people  by  the
 
name
 of
 Narrun now in  the  Pacific,
 including  in Hawaii,"
 says
 
Pensile.  "They are  all  descendants  of  that  first Narrun."
 
The
 group
 picture  on page  58 may have  been
 taken
 at
 Net
 
municipality,
 or  the  people may be  people  of  Net,  Pensile  points
 
out.
 Damian  looks  on with  interest,  as  all  of  this  is  unknown  to
 
him,
 he  acknowledges with a smile.
 Damian  Sohl expresses  a wish
 
to
 hear
 the
 tape.
 I  produce my  tape
 recorder,
 and
 he
 is
 
gratified.
 He  listens  intently  if  somewhat  quizzically.
 
At
 10
 A.M.
 we
 call  on
 the
 Honorable
 Tosiwo
 Nakayama,
 
President  of  the  Federated  States  of Micronesia,  in his  office  in
 
Kolonia.
 He  is  friendly and  pleased  to  receive  his  copy  of  Call
 
of  the  Morning  Bird.
 He  pages  through  the  publication.
 The  lady
 
on  the  left  in  the  picture  of  the  Koben Mori  family he  identifies
 
as
 Isabel.
 Her
 local
 name
 is
 Nolutou.
 (Pensile
 nods
 in
 
agreement,
 although
 he
 has
 previously
 given
 her
 another
 
identity).
 The  second  lady  on  the  left,  says  President  Nakayama,
 
may
 not
 actually be  a member  of  the  Koben  Mori  family.
 A  man
 
named  Jeffrey Arnold,  he  reflects,  a grandson of Taro Mon ,  works
 
at  the  Attorney General's  Office  locally.
 Masao  Takao Mori
 was
 
the  eldest  son  of Taro Mon .
 The  daughter  of  the  eldest  daughter
 
of  Koben Mori  lives  on Ponape.
 The Mori  and  Shirai  families  are
 
both  represented  on Ponape.
 
The
 picture
 entitled
 Dance  in  Ponape  on  page
 59
 of
 the
 
publication
 took
 place  at  the  Little
 League
 Playground,
 says
 
Pensile.
 He
 says  he  recognizes  some  of  the  trees.
 He was
 at
 
that  setting  as  a young  student,  perhaps  at  the  very  dance  in  the
 
photograph.
 The  performer,  noted  as  Ruis  in  the  publication,  was
 
Lewis  or  Rewis,  according  to  Pensile.
 
For
 the  picture  on  page  57  of  preparing  sakau,
 Pensile  and
 
President
 Nakayama
 decide  that  the  picture was  taken
 close
 to
 
where
 the  Administration  Building  is  now located.
 There was
 a
 
dormitory
 for
 boarding
 students
 from
 the
 outer
 islands
 in
 
Japanese
 times
 at
 that
 place.
 Before
 that,
 a
 Spanish
 
administration  building  stood  in  the  same  spot.
 
We
 go  on  to  call  on  the  Speaker of  the
 FSM
 Congress,
 the
 
Honorable  Bethwel Henry,
 at  10:30 A.M.
 He  is  most  enthusiastic
 
about  the  Call  of  the  Morning  Bird  project,  but  acknowledges  that
 
he
 is  too  young  to  have  known  anything  about  the  original  taping
 
by Muranushi.  He  studies  the  photographs,  and
 is very  interested
 
in  the  one  of  the  former  Nankin  but  cannot  identify him.
 Pensile
 
supplies
 the
 information.
 Our
 conversation
 turns
 to
 
anthropological
 matters  in  general  when  Speaker
 Henry
 mentions
 
that
 he  is  from Mokil.
 "Have  you  ever  seen  an  ethnographic  film
 
entitled
 Mokil?"
 I ask.
 He  laughs,
 "I  am  in
 it!
 Can
 you
 
remember  the  part where  it  shows  a young man dancing?
 That  is  me
 
as  a youth.
 Then  the  film  pans  to  a little  girl  who  is
 sitting
 
23
 
on  the  side,  clapping  for my  dance.
 That  little  girl  grew up  and
 
I  married  her.
 But  neither  of  us  ever  saw  the  film until
 many
 
years
 after
 we  were  married.
 What  a surprise we  had
 when
 we
 
happened  to  see  the  film  for  the  first  time!"
 
At
 11:00 A.M.,
 we meet  with  the  Governor  of  Pohnpei  State,
 
the
 Honorable
 Resio
 Moses.
 A younger man
 also,
 he
 has
 no
 
knowledge  of  the  original  taping,
 but  is  very  interested  in
 the
 
Call
 of
 the
 Morning  Bird  project  in  general,
 and
 pleased
 to
 
receive  a copy of  the  publication.
 He  looks  through  the  pages  of
 
photographs  in  the  Ponape  section.
 "You know,"
 he  muses,  "those
 
old  Ponapeans were  very ugly people,
 weren't
 they?
 Why,
 they
 
look
 just  like monkeys."
 He  reflects  upon  the  fact  that
 modern
 
Ponapeans
 have
 a mixed  ethnic  heritage.
 His understanding
 is
 
that
 he
 himself  is  part  German.
 Pensile  Lawrence
 offers
 the
 
information  that  his  own  ethnicity  is  part  French.
 
Iris  Falcam joins  us  for  a lunch break,
 as  does  her husband
 
Leo
 Falcam,
 the
 Postmaster  General  of  Pohnpei
 (and
 the
 most
 
recent
 former
 Governor) .
 He
 shares  with us
 his
 part
 German
 
ethnicity,
 as well  as  his  recent  trip  to  Germany  to meet  some  30
 
long-lost
 relatives.
 The
 afternoon's  activities  begin with
 a
 
1:30  P.M.
 meeting with  the  Honorable  Salter  Etse,  Speaker of  the
 
Pohnpei  State  Legislature.
 We  then  call  on Mr.  Weldis  Welly,  the
 
Acting  Chief  of  the  Federated  States  of Micronesia Department
 of
 
Education,
 and  last  of  all,
 at  3:30  P.M.,
 the Mayor  of  Kolonia
 
Town,
 the
 Honorable
 Victor
 Edwin.
 All of  these
 men
 in
 the
 
afternoon
 are  younger men.
 They  do  not  know anything about  the
 
original  taping by Muranushi.  However,  apparently  it  is  important
 
for  us  to  call  on  all  of  them  for  diplomatic  reasons.
 
The  evening  is  spent  with  Pensile  Lawrence's  daughter,
 Anne
 
Lee,
 and  Eve  Pinsker,  the  anthropology  graduate  student  from  the
 
University of  Chicago who  is  living with Pensile's  family.
 Both
 
women brief me  on  Ponapean  customs  and  culture.
 
September  28,  1985.
 
Our
 work
 on
 Saturday  is  to  call  on
 the
 five
 Nahnmwarki
 
(principal
 chiefs,
 first
 line)  of  the  five
 municipalities
 of
 
Ponape.
 Pensile
 Lawrence  again  serves  as my  research
 assistant
 
and
 Eve
 Pinsker
 accompanies  us.
 We  find
 the
 Nahnmwarki
 of
 
Madolenihmw and  his  wife  sitting  on  a mat  on  the  back verandah  of
 
their
 home.
 Pensile
 owes  special  respect  to
 this
 Nahnmwarki
 
since  Pensile  himself  is  from Madolenihmw.
 Accordingly,  Pensile
 
gets
 down
 on
 all
 fours
 and
 crawls
 forward
 to
 meet
 this
 
Nahnmwarki.
 I follow  Pensile  and  do  likewise.
 The  Nahnmwarki's
 
name  is  Salter  S.
 Hadley.
 He  is  62  years  old.
 He  has  held  the
 
title
 for
 five  years.
 We  present  him with his  is  copy of
 the
 
publication,  and  turn  on  the  tape  recorder  so  that  he  can  listen.
 
We  take  several  pictures,  with his  permission.
 
Pensile  sings  along with  the  songs.
 The  Nahnmwarki
 points
 
out  that  some  of  the  songs  are  Mortlockese.
 The woman who  sings
 
in
 a rather  high voice,
 for  example,
 is   Mortlockese
 woman.
 
For  the  song  that  features  a male  solo voice,
 B-17  on  page  57  of
 
24
 
the  publication,
 
Sokehs  island.
 Item B-19,  page  58,  is  described  as  a dance  song
 
of  Motluk.
 Properly,
 this  refers  to  the  Mortlock  islands.
 The
 
stick dance,
 item B-21,  page  59,  also  took place  at  Sokehs.
 The
 
performer's  name,
 says  the  Nahnmwarki,  should  be  shown as  Lewis,
 
not
 Ruis
 ( Ruis  is  the  Japanese  spelling  of
 the
 name).
 That
 
Lewis
 is
 a  Mortlockese man.
 He  is  an old
 man
 now,
 and
 is
 
crippled.
 
the  man  is  Mortlockese.  The  event  took place  at
 
The
 man at  the  left  in  the  photo  on page  58  died  about
 3-4
 
years
 ago.
 The  girl  on  the  right  lives  near  to  the  Sunset  Bar.
 
She  is  a grandmother now,
 and her name  is Matilde,
 according  to
 
the  Nahnmwarki.
 
It
 is
 a very hot  day,
 but  it  is  cool at  the  back
 of
 the
 
Nahnmwarki's house,
 as  there  are many  trees  here.
 We  sit  on
 a
 
mat.
 The  Nahnmwarki  is wearing an Aloha  shirt,
 slacks with  the
 
cuffs  rolled  up,  and he  is  barefooted.
 
The
 old  pictures  in  the  publication are  of  considerable  interest
 
to  him.
 The  Nahnmwarki's  wife  shows  us  a photo  that was  taken  in
 
Japan.
 Apparently  they vacationed  in Japan  recently.
 They  can
 
speak  fluent  Japanese.
 A Dr.  Hirai  from Japan  in  the  1970's  took
 
a skull  from Nan Madol  to  Japan  for an exhibit.
 No  one  seems  to
 
know,
 says  Pensile,
 who  gave Dr.
 Hirai permission  to  take
 the
 
skull  away  from Nan Madol,  but  it was  not  the  Nahnmwarki.
 
The
 Nahmnwarki's
 wife  brings  us  cans  of  cold  soda
 pop
 to
 
drink.
 Pensile  laughs,
 "If  the  Nahnmwarki  gives  you  something,
 
then
 you must  eat  or  drink  it
 -
 you  cannot  refuse."
 When
 it
 
is  time  to  leave,
 Pensile  backs  up while  crawling until he  is  at
 
the
 edge
 of
 the
 verandah,
 never
 turning
 his
 back
 on
 the
 
Nahnmwarki
 until  he  is  a considerable  distance  away.
 I  follow
 
his  example.
 
At  noon,
 we  are  at  a kamadipw  (ritual  presentation of  food)
 
being
 held
 at
 the
 nahs
 (community
 meeting
 house)
 in
 U
 
municipality.
 We
 come
 here
 because  the  Nahnmwarki
 of
 U  is
 
attending
 this  kamadipw.
 We  will present  him with his  copy
 of
 
the
 publication  here.
 About  300  people
 are
 attendance,
 men,
 
women  and  children  of  all  ages.
 The  occasion  is  the  honoring  of
 
the
 athletes who performed well  at  the  recent  island-wide  sports
 
competition.
 The
 competition
 was
 held
 in
 celebration
 of
 
Liberation Day on  September  11,  the  day  that  Ponape was  liberated
 
by American  forces near  the  close  of World War  II.
 Canoe  racing
 
took
 place,
 track  and  field  events,
 baseball
 games,
 swimming
 
contests  and  such.
 
The
 nahs  is  a large  public  building made  of  concrete  with  a
 
corrugated  iron  roof.  It  is  walled on  three  sides.
 The  open  side
 
provides  access  in and  out.
 Wooden rafters  that  support  the  roof
 
are  tied  together with  sennit.
 About  half  of  the  building has  no
 
floor;
 this  part  is  earthen underfoot.
 Where  the  other half  of
 
the  floor would  be,
 three  tiers  of  concrete  rise  up,  on  the  side
 
of
 the  building  opposite  the  open  side.
 Single  concrete
 tiers
 
are  found  on  the  other  two  enclosed  sides.
 In  the  portion  of  the
 
2S
 
building
 with  an earthen  floor,
 shares  of  food  are  lined  up
 in
 
woven
 baskets,
 the  ingredients  for  sakau  are
 dragged
 in,
 and
 
people
 walk
 back
 and  forth  in  brisk activity.
 On
 the
 first
 
concrete
 tier,
 men  sit  in  a circ1e  pounding  sakau.
 Women
 and
 
children
 and
 some  men  sit  here  and  there  on
 the
 other
 cement
 
tiers.
 The  Nahnmwarki  of  U municipality and  his wife  sit  in  the
 
center  on  the  highest  tier,
 on a mat  on  the  floor,  surrounded  by
 
a  small  circle  of  high  titled  people.
 I follow Pensile
 across
 
the
 earthen  floor and we  climb  the  three  tiers,
 in a  crouching
 
fashion
 with bent  knees  as we  get  closer  to  the  Nahnmwarki,
 but
 
we  do not  crawl.
 Pensile  introduces me,
 explains  our
 project,
 
and
 I  hand  the  Nahnmwarki of  U a copy of  the
 publication.
 He
 
seems
 pleased,
 but  his  attention  is  diverted because  of  all
 of
 
the
 activity
-
 
going
 on
 around
 us.
 "Just
 sit
 down
 and
 be
 
comfortable,"
 Pensile  advises.
 I squeeze myself  into  a  little
 
spot  among  the  shares  of  food,  as  does  Pensile.
 
The  Nahnmwarki  is  dressed  in  a lavender Aloha
 shirt,
 black
 
slacks,
 and
 he
 wears  eyeglasses.
 He  is  an older man
 but
 he
 
appears
 to
 be  in  good  health.
 His wife wears  an  island
 style
 
muumuu;
 other  titled persons  sitting  in  the  small  circle  on  the
 
mat  are  in  similar  dress.
 Every now and  then,
 runners  bring
 a
 
cup  of  sakau  to  this  group.
 Each man  in  turn has  a sip  from  the
 
cup,  starting with  the  Nahnmwarki,  who has  the  first  cup.
 No  one
 
seems  to  drain  the  cup when  it  is  his  turn  to  drink;
 the  coconut
 
shell  cup  is  passed back  to  the  runner with  sakau  still  in  it.
 
Shares  of  food  are  in metal washtubs  and plastic  dishpans  all
 
around
 me.
 The
 content  of  the  shares  is
 varied,
 traditional
 
foods
 mixed
 with modern  foods.
 I observe  the
 following
 food
 
items
 in  the  various  shares:
 cooked  rice  in
 pots,
 loaves
 of
 
bread,
 dinner  rolls  in  plastic bags,
 canned mackerel,  a plastic
 
sack of  tootsie  pops,  canned  spaghetti,  canned  hash,  watermelons,
 
coconuts,
 whole  cooked  chickens,  whole  cooked  fish,  large  pieces
 
of
 cooked
 pork,
 uncooked bags  of  rice,
 cookies  in
 cellophane
 
packages,
 cans  of  luncheon meat,
 sacks  of
 sugar,
 yams,
 taro,
 
sweet
 potatoes,
 bananas,
 fruit  juice  in  cans,
 sacks  of  potato
 
chips,  donuts,  and  the  like.
 Some  of  the  shares  have  garlands  of
 
flowers  on  them.
 In one  share,  I observe  what  looks  like  a home
 
made  layer  cake  wrapped  in  aluminum  foil with  lollypops  on  top  as
 
decorations.
 
People  sit  here  and  there  among  the  basins  of  food.
 
Near  to where  I sit  is  what  looks  like  a litter  of  food.
 It
 
is  supported  by  two  poles  on  either  side  of  it.
 In  the middle  of
 
the  litter  is  a tree  that  is  tall  enough  to  reach up  to  the
 high
 
ceiling of  this  public  building.
 It  looks  as  though  the  tree  has
 
been dug  out  of  the  ground with  its  root  system intact,
 as  roots
 
and  a great  amount  of  accompanying earth give  balance  to  the  tree
 
so
 that
 it
 does
 not
 topple
 over.
 Diversified
 shares
 of
 
traditional  and modern  food are  piled high  around  the base  of  the
 
tree.
 Tied
 to
 the  trunk of  the  tree,
 climbing  around  on
 the
 
shares  of  food,
 is  a live  chicken.
 Pensile  confirms  that
 this
 
litter
 is
 the
 Nahnmwarki
 of  U's  share
 of
 the
 distribution.
 
r
 
Lengths
 of  fabric  are  tied  from  the  rafters  of  the
 building
 in
 
close
 proximity  to  the  top  of  the  tree.
 A short  distance
 away
 
stands
 another  similarly  impressive  litter,
 but  lacking  a  tree
 
and
 a  live
 chicken.
 This  share,
 says  Pensile,
 is
 for
 the
 
Nahnken.
 
Speeches
 have
 been
 going
 on,
 and  now
 it
 is
 time
 for
 
entertainment.
 A  band
 of  twelve  young men come
 up
 onto
 the
 
second  tier near  to  the  Nahnmwarki with  guitars,  ukuleles  and  the
 
like.
 A  P.A.
 system and microphone  have  been  set  up  for  them.
 
They are  one  of  the  bands  that  will  take  part  in  the  competitions
 
on United Nations Day on October  24  on Ponape.
 They are wearing
 
navy blue  T-shirts,
 blue  jeans  and  shell necklaces.
 Some  of  the
 
young
 men appear  to  be  of  high school age;
 others  seem
 to
 be
 
elementary
 school  students.
 The  band  sings  a number of
 songs.
 
Everybody  listens,
 and  applauds  enthusiastically.
 They  sing  an
 
old  song.
 "That  song  has  old words.
 We  don't  know the meaning
 
of  those  words  anymore,"  Pensile  tells me.
 Then  they present  a
 
chant,  utilizing a new tune.
 
Some
 of  the  small  children  crowd  in  closer  to  listen  to  the
 
band.
 Even  though  it  is  a hot  day outside,
 it  is  cool  in
 here
 
because
 the
 building
 is made  of  concrete  and has  such
 a  high
 
ceiling.
 The
 titled
 men  laugh and  joke with
 the
 Nahnmwarki.
 
Two
 of  the  young  boys who  are  singing  a duet momentarily
 forget
 
the
 words
 to  their  song.
 The  crowd
 chuckles
 with
 laughter;
 
parents
 smile  indulgently.
 Again  the  two young  boys  begin
 the
 
song
 and
 their  high voices  falter.
 They  cannot
 remember
 the
 
words.
 This  time  one  of  the  older boys  leads  them.
 They watch
 
his
 face
 intently as  he  mouths  the  words.
 It  is  a  very
 long
 
song.
 When  it  is  over,  the  crowd applauds,  and  the  chief  laughs.
 
"Put  in  cabbage,
 onions  and  peppers,
 because  I am very hungry,"
 
is  the  refrain  of  the  next  song.
 Pensile  explains  that  the  song
 
was
 written
 to  thank  the  agricultural  growers  for  growing
 food
 
that
 is
 good  for  the  body.
 The  cultural  idea  is  to  eat
 to
 be
 
full,  not  to  eat  to  enjoy  the  taste  of  the  food  particularly.
 
The  band  departs,
 and men  step  up  to  the microphone  to make
 
speeches.
 Some
 men
 direct  the  distribution of  the
 shares
 of
 
food.
 Another
 man writes  in a notebook as  individual  shares  are
 
pointed
 to  and  the  names  of  the  owners  of  the  share
 are
 called
 
out,
 keeping  a record  of who  gets what.
 Some  men  come  forward
 
and  together  carry out  various  shares  of  the  food.
 One  share  is
 
identified  as  belonging  to  Pensile  and myself.
 Pensile  explains
 
that  we  can  eat  from  the  share  if we  are  hungry.
 We  eat  a little
 
fish and  some  bananas.
 A man  comes  to  help  Pensile  carry  out  our
 
share  to  Pensile's  truck.
 
Pensile
 explains  that  the  celebrating here  at  the  nahs  will
 
go  on  all  day.
 More  sakau will  be  pounded  and  consumed.
 Later
 
on  the  athletes  will  be  anointed with  perfume.
 People will
 eat
 
food  in  a leisurely manner  as  they  become  hungry.
 Large  trophies
 
are  carried  in  at  this  point  and  presented  to  the  Nahnmwarki.
 We
 
say
 our  goodbyes  to  the  Nahnmwarki  and  his  retinue  and  begin
 to
 
descend
 the  concrete  tiers,
 maintaining  a crouching  position  as
 
2
6
 
27
 
we
 do  so.
 We must  call  on  other  Nahnmwarki  today,
 so we
 must
 
leave  this  gathering.
 
We  arrive  at  the  home  of  Frederick  lariarte,
 the  Nahnmwarki
 
of
 Net  at  2:40 P.M.
 He  and  his wife welcome  us  to  their
 home.
 
It  is  a big,  newly built  home  in  an  isolated area.
 The house  has
 
modern  furniture  and  an  indoor  flush  toilet.
 Both of  them are  in
 
casual
 clothes  and  bare  feet.
 We  leave  our  shoes
 outside
 and
 
follow
 them  in,
 walking  in  a slightly  crouched  position  out
 of
 
respect  to  the  Nahnmwarki.
 
This
 Nahnmwarki  is  very pleased  to  receive  his  copy  of
 the
 
publication,
 and we  play part  of  the  tape  for  them  to  hear.
 He
 
is  73  years  old,
 and has  held  the  title  for  8 years.
 He  gained
 
the  title  after his  brother Max died.
 
At
 3:30
 P.M.,
 we  arrive  at  the  home  of  the  Nahnmwarki
 of
 
Sokehs,
 lonnis Artui.
 His  son,  a police  officer,  greets  us  and
 
explains  that  his  father  and mother have  gone  off  to
 Pakin.
 At
 
Pakin atoll,
 families  go  there  and  camp  out  for  the weekend,
 as
 
they also  do  on Ant  atoll.
 Owing  to  time  constraints,  we  decide
 
to
 leave  the  publication with  the  police  officer.
 He
 promises
 
that
 he
 will
 give
 the
 copy  to his
 father
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 
Nahnmwarki  returns.
 
It
 will
 be
 too  difficult  to  find  the  Nahnmwarki
 of
 Kiti
 
today.
 There
 are
 many
 places  where
 he
 could
 possibly
 be.
 
Pensile
 will make  sure  that  the  Nahnmwarki  of  Kiti  receives
 his
 
copy
 of  the  publication  at  a later date.
 Our work  for  the
 day
 
has
 ended,
 and we  eat  dinner  at  home with Pensile's  family  from
 
the
 share
 of
 food
 we  were  given  earlier  in
 the
 day
 at
 the
 
kamad ipw.
 
September  29,  1985.
 
In
 a  wrap-up  discussion  session,
 a group  of  us
 meet
 for
 
brunch
 this  morning.
 It  is  a chance  for  Pensile  to  clear up
 a
 
few
 points.
 The
 stick
 dancers  in  the  photo  on
 page
 59
 are
 
Mortlockese  from  Sokehs,
 as  mentioned  previously.
 The photo  of
 
men  and women  together  on page  58 was  taken at  the  border  of
 Net
 
and
 Sokehs
 municipalities,
 in
 Nanpumal  and
 Nankui
 sections.
 
Among  the  young men  and women  in  the  photo,
 he  recognizes  a  man
 
nicknamed  Kanikindol,
 a member  of  the  clan Dipwilap.
 The woman
 
who  is  about  the  third  from  the  left  is  a woman named Matilde who
 
is  still  alive.
 She  is  the  sister of  a  man named Lipenent;
 his
 
other name  is  Pelis.
 He  works  for  the  Department  of  Education  in
 
Ponape
 in  the Aging  Program,
 teaching  school  children  about  old
 
Ponapean ways.
 The  man  on  the  right  of  the  photo  is  a  relative
 
of  the  present Nahnken of  Sokehs.
 
Pensile's  sister  sang  on  the  original  tape.
 I met  her  last
 
night
 at  dinner.
 Her  Spanish Christian name  is  Esperanza Maria
 
Barbara.
 Her
 last  name  is  Tadios.
 Hers  is  the
 young
 female
 
voice  singing  a solo  for  B-20,  page  58,  identified  as  Iwana.
 She
 
was
 born  in  Kiti.
 She  can  remember  being  taken  out  to  the  ship
 
to  sing  .
 .
 ."into  an  interesting  looking machine."
 The  song  she
 
r
 
S  
26
 
sings  is  a love  song.
 It was  an  introduced  song.
 The  tune was
 
picked  up  first,
 then words were written  to  accompany  the
 tune.
 
"Only
 older
 people
 know that  song  today,"
 says
 Pensile.
 He
 
demonstrates  by  singing  the  song himself.
 
On page  56  of  the  booklet,  it  notes  that  Muranushi  recorded  songs
 
and  chants  only  in Kolonia  on Ponape.
 If Mrs.  Tadios  is  correct,
 
most
 or  all  of  the  recordings  done  on  Ponape may have  been
 done
 
aboard  the  ship,
 with  singers  and  chanters  brought  out  from
 the
 
shore.
 
One
 of
 the  songs  sung  by  an  old woman was  a  chant
 called
 
Nisenlipen
 or Ngisenlepen.
 Lepen was  the  name  of  a priest,
 or
 
Lepenmoar.
 Pensile
 can
 remember
 part
 of
 that
 chant,
 and
 
demonstrated
 his
 knowledge  by chanting.
 The  chant
 tells
 a
 
story
 about  an  interesting  feather.
 It must  be  the  feather
 of
 
the
 kingbirds
 of
 New Guinea.
 The
 ruler
 of
 the
 Saudeleurs
 
requested
 Lepenmoar  to  go  and  get  that  feather.
 But
 Lepenmoar
 
made
 magic
 and  sent  his men  to  get  the  feather.
 The
 Ponapean
 
name
 for  the  bird  is  Diripeiso;
 Winen Diripeiso  in
 the
 chant
 
means  the  feather  of Diripeiso.
 One  can  find  that  same  chant  in
 
Hauibruch's
 expedition
 account,
 Volume
 II,
 says
 Pensi-le
 
authoritatively.
 Pensile
 is
 a member  of  that
 priest's
 clan.
 
This
 is
 why  he  knows  the  chant.
 His  relative  came
 from
 that
 
area.
 
Pensile
 is
 62  years  old.
 Pensile
 knew
 Luelen.
 Luelen
 
talked
 with
 Pensile  before  he  died.
 Pensile's
 mother
 was
 a
 
daughter-in-law of  Luelen.
 She  died when Pensile was  eight  years
 
old.
 Pensile  says  that  Yoshio  Kondo  of  Bishop Museum stayed with
 
Luelen
 during  the  Micronesian  Expedition,
 while  the  team was  on
 
Ponape.
 
At  mid-day,
 a group  of  us  made  a trip  by boat  to Nan Madol,
 
the  famous megalithic  ruins  of  Ponape  on Temwen  island,  described
 
in The  Book of  Luelen  by Luelen  Bernart.
 Leo  Falcam,  Postmaster
 
General  of  Ponape  State  and husband  of  Iris  Falcam,
 was  our  tour
 
guide.
 Nan Madol  consists  of  approximately  92  artificially built
 
islets,
 mostly
 rectangular  in shape.
 They  range  in  size
 from
 
about  350  square meters  to  8,400  square meters.
 The  entire  site
 
covers
 nearly  150 acres  in  shallow water,
 about  a foot  deep
 at
 
low  tide.
 It was  occupied by high  titled  aristocrats  and
 their
 
servants  since  as  early  as  1180 A.D.
 It  is  thought  to have  been
 
evacuated
 because
 of  depopulation  caused  by  smallpox and
 other
 
introduced  diseases  (Gene  Ashby,  1983,  A Guide  to  Ponape,  Ponape:
 
Rainy  Day  Press).
 It  was  a most  interesting  field  trip.
 
That
 same  evening,
 with  the  distribution efforts
 for
 the
 
Call  of  the  Morning  Bird  project  completed,
 this  writer  returned
 
to Guam.
 
Summary
 
This
 Field
 Report  tells  of  the  writer's  research
 trip
 to
 
Yap,
 Palau
 and  Ponape  to  distribute  copies  of  the
 publication,
 
Call
 of
 the  Morning  Bird,
 for  the  Department  of
 Anthropology,
 
Bernice  P.
 Bishop  Museum,
 Honolulu,
 Hawaii.
 On Yap  and  Palau,
 
numerous
 
original
 taping
 for  the  project  in  1936  in one way  or
 another.
 
The
 research  endeavor  at  Ponape  was
 more
 political,
 involving
 
younger  government  leaders  and  fewer  older  people,  but  benefit  of
 
a  different  sort  nevertheless was  achieved  for  the  project.
 On
 
each
 of
 the
 islands,
 Yap,
 Palau
 and
 Ponape,
 
expressed  a wish  to  have  the  chants  and  songs  that
 
Micronesia
 in
 the
 1980's  be  recorded  for
 their
 
grandchildren.
 Dr.  Elizabeth  Tatar  and  Mrs.  Bess

The
 writer
 wishes
 to
 thank
 Dr.
 Elizabeth
 Tatar
 of
 the
 
Department  of Anthropology,
 Bernice  P.
 Bishop  Museum,  Honolulu,
 
Hawaii,
 for  offering me  the  unique  opportunity  to  distribute  the
 
copies  of  the  Call of  the  Morning  Bird  publication  in Micronesia.
 
Dr.
 Tatar
 is
 also  credited  for  recognizing  the
 value
 of
 the
 
Muranushi  tapes when  she  came  across  them at  the  Bishop Museum  in
 
the
 course
 of  her work  in  ethnomusicology.
 Dr.
 Yosi
 Sinoto,
 
Chairman,
 Department  of Anthropology,
 Bernice  P.  Bishop Museum,
 
is
 thanked
 for his many  contributions  to  the  project
 from
 the
 
time  of  its  inception.
 Mrs.
 Bess  Hawes  is  acknowledged  for
 her
 
enthusiastic  support  of  the  project,
 and her  sincere  interest  in
 
the
 outcome
 of  the  distribution effort.
 Finally,
 I  wish
 to
 
extend
 my
 grateful  thanks  to  the  many  people  in Micronesia
 who
 
hosted me  in  the  course  of  the  field  project,  and who  shared with
 
me  their  responses  to  the  Call  of  the Morning  Bird.
 Their names
 
appear  in  sequential  order  in  the  body  of  this  field  report.

Dear Bess,
 
This has been a year of ups and downs.
 My work at CAHA
 
has been especially bumpy since our new director took over
 
in January.
 Deborah Bordallo,  the Lt.  Governor's daughter,
 
immediately decided that CAHA meant art gallery,  and
 
proceeded to head us in that direction.
 Although she mouths
 
support for the culture,  she doesn't give me time to pursue
 
the cultural programs I have developed in the past.
 All
 
efforts have been directed towards opening and maintaining
 
an art gallery,  which through "cultural tourism" -
 another
 
of her favorite words -
 will make CAHA self sustaining.
 She
 
proceeded to alienate the legislature by moving us to a
 
three-storey building in Tumon without courting their
 
support.
 First floor is an art gallery,  second floor is the
 
Guam museum,  and third floor is our shared office space.
 
Consequently,  the legislature refused to approve the
 
$400,000 needed to pay the annual rent on the building.
 So,
 
after moving there in April,  spending a considerable amount
 
of money and time to open the gallery in October,  we now
 
face the prospect of moving out because we can't pay the
 
rent.
 There has been a show of support by the private
 
sector,  and it looks as though various interests there might
 
pull through to pay our rent.
 I don't object to the gallery
 
idea -
 after all,  I am a visual artist and it is a beautiful
 
gallery.
 But I don't have the skills or inclination to run
 
a gallery.
 She has put me in charge of finding exhibits to
 
place in the gallery and of finding artists and
 
craftspersons willing to sell in the gift shop on
 
consignment.
 There is no time left for folk and traditional
 
arts.
 To make matters worse,  her management style is
 
dictatorial,  and she has made it clear that she doesn't want
 
our advice.
 She yells at staff,  belittles us in front of
 
anybody who happens to be in the office,  and changes her
 
mind so often that we don't know what to expect from day to
 
day.
 The whole staff is demoralized and frustrated.
 
Frankly,  I'm looking for a way out.
 
I complete my master's degree in Micronesian Studies at
 
the University of Guam this spring.
 I am applying to a few
 
universities to pursue a Ph.D.  program in either American
 
Studies,  Anthropology,  or Folklore,  hopefully to begin
 
course work in the fall of 1996.
 So far,  University of
 
Hawaii looks like the most likely place.
 I'm looking
 
forward to going to school full-time.
 The research I've
 
done for my master's work has been very interesting.
 I've
 
learned a great deal about Guam and the surrounding
 
Micronesian islands,  which has whetted my appetite to do
 
more research.
 
Sandy,  Bob,  and their two little ones have bought a
 
home here,  so it looks like they'll be here for awhile.
 
Sandy did some work for the Humanities Council and
 
subsequently was asked to join their board of directors.
 
Sam still lives at the "ranch",  and we see him and his 3-
year-old Kalani every week.
 My mother retired in August and
 
enjoys sewing,  baking,  and gardening projects.
 We see her
 
quite often.
 Of course my dad and Lucy still live in
 
Inarajan,  then my brother and sister are also here,  and
 
cousin Cindy and family.
 The whole clan manages to get
 
together every month or so.
 Then,  of course,  Johnny's large
 
family has various get-togethers,  Inarajan fiesta being the
 
main one.
 
Gef Pa'go Chamorro cultural village is surviving pretty
 
much on its own now.
 I still serve as advisor to their
 
board,  but don't have time to help them with day-to-day
 
operations.
 They are funding their daily operations on
 
group tours,  twice-weekly bingo nights,  and a recently-
opened tortilla package sales operation.
 They are a truly
 
dedicated, wonderful bunch of people.
 I wish I could spend
 
more time with them.
 
Mary is opening a new Colorful Creations store in a new
 
mall in the Dededo/Harinon area.
 There has been a general
 
population shift up north,  and that seems to be where all
 
the businesses are going.
 She hasn't decided whether to
 
keep the old location open along with the new one or not.
 
Its an exciting and also scarey move.
 But I think we will
 
come through alright.
 Dottie Wintterle is writing a second
 
book,  of Chamorro legends, which I'm illustrating.
 I have
 
the sketches done and am anxious to get to the actual batiks
 
after my comprehensive exams are done on December 15th.
 
I was so glad I got to visit with you in Chapel Hill.
 
I hope to see you in Western Samoa for the 7th Festival.
 If
 
things go as planned I will no longer be working for CAHA
 
and will probably go as an observer.
 Perhaps we'll have
 
time for a longer visit then.
 Please keep in touch.
 
Always,
