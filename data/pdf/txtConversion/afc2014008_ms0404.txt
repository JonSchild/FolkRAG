Dear Ms. Hawes,
 
I
'am a student at Wesleyan University who is pursuing::
 
a
. career in ethno-musicology.
 I am especially interested
 
in Western European and American folk music and would
 
be extremely interested in doing an internship,either
 
here or abroad,with someone working in the field.
 
Having lived in Sweden, I speak fluent Swedish and
 
I also have a command of French.
 I have an extensive
 
musical background and I play the piano, saxophone,
 
ecoustic guitar, and the Appalachian dulcimer.  Do
 
you know of anyone presently in the field, or soon
 
to be involved in research, who would be interested in
 
having an intern?  Thank-you very much for your help.
 
Sincerely,
 
�

MEMORANDUM
 
TO:
 Mary Ann Tighe
 
FRCM:
 Bess Lomax Hawes
 
SUBJECT:
 Folk Arts P
anel
 
You may remember my mentioning to you that I had reappointed all Folk
 
Arts panel members for another year as a kind of s
top-gap action so
 
that I would have a panel to meet with.  However, some members have
 
just been on the j
ob too long.
 
Regardless of what happens with Folk Music, I
 would recommend the
 
following Folk Arts panel changes for the coming year:
 
a
.  Dave Nelson (Montana State Arts Director) feels i
t is time
 
for him to move along.
 I had previously asked Bernie Lopez (New Mexico
 
State Arts Council Director) if he would be interested in joining the
 
Folk Arts panel in the future, and he had said yes.  Dave apparently
 
spoke to Bernie about it, and assuming your and J
im's concurrence, they
 
are s
et to make this change after the Folk Arts J
une meeting when Bernie
 
will simultaneously go off the Literature panel.  Len Randolph knows
 
about this.
 I am particularly happy to have Sr. Lopez because Folk
 
Arts does so much funding with Hispanics in general and in New Mexico
 
specifically.
 
b
.  Dr. Henry Glassie of the University of P
ennsylvania has been
 
on the Folk Arts panel since the end of 1974.  He is tired, and his
 
attendance is becoming erratic.
 I should like to replace him (
after
 
the J
une meeting) with Roger Welsh of the University of Nebraska.
 
Roger's principal area of interest is in the visual arts, especially
 
traditional architecture and Museum display.  With Dave Nelson and Henry
 
leaving the panel, we will have a gap in that important field.  Besides,
 
we need somebody from the midwest, Roger is an energetic and amiable
 
gentleman, and I
 believe he would work extremely well with the other
 
Folk Arts panel members.
 I am attaching his vita for your consideration.
 
Attachment

Dear Dan:
 
Could you ,
please send me, as rapidly as possible an up-to-date
 
vital  Further, t
13oW
.jh this is not custoruary in academic
 
circles, I need to know the salary ranje for your various
 
,
past jobs.  The reason is that Civil Service has to rate you
 
for a salary category, and they do this based on the quantity
 
of e
34?erience and the salary level at which you have previously
 
worked.  You may not re
ar all of this, but give me as much
 
information as you can; it's terribly iwportant in getting you
 
a decent salary.
 
The idea of borrowing you from Santa Cruz et al, appears to
 
have t
sun into a snag.  Like many bureaucratic devices, the
 
procedures are unduly c
omplex. a
nd great hunks of the money
 
actually go to the university rather than you.  I am vmrking
 
on several additional possibilities, including just an ordinary
 
civil service job (which is why I need to know your past salary
 
levels).
 
Sorry to sound discouraging.  I still think we can work some-
thing out, but do send me your up--to--date vita and the other
 
information right a
r
ray.  I may even include a civil service
 
fora so that you can see ,
what information is needed.  If you
 
fill it out (and if you get a job here, you'll have to anyway)
 
be sure to send the vita too so that fican have both.
 
Best regards to Ximo m and the children.  I hope you're still
 
having a u
aarvelvua tiast, and that the dissertation is <m#tsQ
 
along swimmingly.

The messy pencil handwriting is mind; the neat Gothic

,
since Jo

dating, it's not as serious as I had #irst thought to
 
include specific grant amounts.  Tho information is accurate

and based on how V W when you think the book will actually
 
come out and how it will be used.

Dear C

A few months ago I had the pleasure of aeetinj your husband
 
at an arts conference in Jackson, at which time he told me
 
of his long-time friendship with my  brother, Alan Lomax. an
 
the basis of our pheasant conversation, I encouraged a young
 
Mississippi folkborist, Paula '
radlock to call c
an you in
 
Biloxi recently.  I hope her visit was not an imposition.
 
Paula has just been in Kashington and told me about tae splendid
 
festival you and your organization ran in 1976.  It sounds
 
simply wonderful.  The traditional arts of the Mississippi oulf
 
coast are close to my heart, and it rakes me happy to hs►ar that
 
they are being celebrated.  I hope You'll be able to do it
 
again someday.
 
For your interest, I am enclosing a copy of the newly ,
zmblished
 
Folk arts program.  If you ever hear of any group or project
 
that might benefit by our support, rlh4pe you will put us in
 
touch.  And please give my regards to your husband.

hope, On mV next visit to Mississippi to have time to come to

Dear Peg W:
 
During xy week's stay in
, Gainesville after they Folk Arts
 
Conference, I was continually hearing people talking about
 
the e
esttevance and about projects they have in slued as a
.
 
result of it.  Lots of peoples called ■
 s up and wanted to
 
talk and ow
 though I wan trying to have a bit of a vaca-
tion, I can't say that I winded a bit.  it is so, ao good
 
to see prtgple in Florida excited about the folk arts in
 
their a m state.
 
The conference was a marvelous take-off point and x do hope
 
that you will have the support to hire another next year.  A
 
word of warning * thom p
..  The -
second year con
 farenco in quite
 
a diffe =wvt thing than the first.  During the first, T
amil
 
paid your cane in a winse in r
e cogniaRing all t ars who have
 
coatributed so much in the past to research in t#s state aud
 
you also 14 mtified those individuals that you I
tnew who are
 
currently working !hare.  You got people of m my different
 
groups together and ta A
zing.  Next year, you have an even
 
bigger t
rade
 beginning
, to direct some of the energies into
 
a focussed program for the state.
 
As the year goes on, plans and ideas for such a program will
 
develop and ■sad► will bet
s evident that are now hidden
 
noway.
 M at root used to do acre than anything e
m
s, if to
 
keep all of the poople at the confera me in touch with one
 
another.  Ps
is thi
s idea of starting a F&orida Folklore
 
moiety as a twsult of the conference would} *
 t be a bad ideal.
 
-2--
At Fast then you could have an o
 z9a nizetional fran moork
 
to fit every me into.  You even
 eight try calling on Bob
 
Thomson for advice —  I think you ho m MOIL► him over and
 
he'd probably be flattered to put in his two w
t's worth.

Dear Mr. Normans
 
it was indeed a pleasure to have the opportunity to m et you
 
at the recent Folt Arta C
.osference in M ite Springs.  I was
 
awry that you at
ed your wife could not stay for the length
 
of the meetl M.  it was a most interesting one,
, bringing
 
together people from a nudwc of varying interest groups.  I
 
was pleased to see such a fine turn-out for the conference
 
and bape that all of the enthusiasm that arose there will be
 
directed toward further mock in preserving and presenting the
 
folk arts wil
t in the state of Plorida.
 
You are to be v
lmsoee ded .
for the role that you have played in
 
including the folk arts within the cultural prograwndzg of
 
your state.  They are so often overlooked, yet they are in
 
reality the true expressions of all tho American peoples.  I
 
wish you continued success in your work
. and }
pope that if
 
either Bass Lomax Hawes, the director of the Folk Arts Program,
 
or I can be of any assistance to you, you will feel free to

urban cultural activities.  As I said at tho meeting, I
 
believe we must start by thinking about what's good about
 
cities.  If they are nothing but hell-holes, why do people
 
all over the world continue to flood theca?
 
1.
 Leaving aside the economic factor, which I cannot
 
evaluate, I believe what pushes people to the cities is
 
boredom and stagnation and neglect by the center. and what
 
pulls thew there is excitement and variety and stimulation
 
from the center.
 
I would therefore conceive of variety as being the major
 
characteristic upon which we should build our urban cultural
 
plans.  we need to set up a kind of mT
torgasbord of many
 
different kinds of cultural events and activities which
 
each urbanite could sample and savor.

.
 American cities are not just mini-United :
nations, t
hef
 
are z
aini-world co munities.  There are sizeable congregations
 
of Samoans, Palauans and even Syriac-speaking Assyrians (the
 
very sane who came down like the wolf on the fold) in metro-
politan San Francisco.  At a recent multi-ethnic festival in
 
Youngstown, Ohio, they had to list 23 different groups --
including the Ruthenians -- to get even half the folks in.
 
These groups don't have nations any more, but they still
 
cling to their special cultural identities.  Any urban pro-
gram devised by the Arts Endowment r
oust include these small
 
cultures, if it is to be worthy of the aims of our constitution.

.
 We must continually remember that eblinic communities are
 
concerned with the arts on two levels:
 full participation
 
for minority groups in the major art forms. and ethnic
 
identity.  The sponsorship of minority participation in
 
symphony orchestras, art galleries and modern dance, and the
 
presentation and encouragement of arts indegenous to wdnority
 
traditions must be addressed simultaneously but differently.
 
4.
 In the latter effort, it is not enough just to turn the
 
problem over to the ethnic organizations; many of their most

ardent spokesmen are actually embarrassed by their traditional
 
arts.  A field worker in Chicago told me recently she visited
 
a Greek family who were so ashaned of the "old-fashioned"
 
ways of their grandparents, they actually locked the old folks
 
in the attic throughout her visit.  1 continue to recommend
 
the utilization of culturally trained folk arts specialists,
 
(many of whore are themselves fraa minority ccum =nities) in
 
all cultural retention endeavors.
 
5.
 Perhaps we could develop a task-force of such specialists
 
who could be turned loose for a year on a single metropolitan
 
area with the aim of identifying, strengthening and prizing
 
the arts that are already there.  This could culminate,
 
perhaps, in a single major indigenous arts festival which
 
might, indeed, include all levels of available arts activities.
 
the "*lite" as well.
 
2be R
ican Anthropological Association has already suggested
 
a m
o Iti-disciplinary research project of this type in Baltimore,
 
and is well on the way to raising funding for a pilot year.
 
The city of r
louston, also, is b
inning a major re--exazrination
 
of its neighborhood cultural life with somewhat the above
 
aims in mind.  2 shall continue to keep in touch with both
 
these projects and can U ep you informed.

Dear Donn Wright:
 
Thank you for your letter.
 
I have checked on the status of your Folk arts grant.  I
 
understand that the grant letter will be in the mails to
 
you this week.  As you have found with the Museums Program,
 
the problOR of the lengthy period between a project's
 
Vaceiving final
 recaasr
�i►tion and the issuance of the grant
 
letter, is a chronic  o
o
 ne within the Sndosar�nt, and there
 
are days when 1 "spair.  on other days I decide that at
 
least matters can only improve.  As you say, with Folk Arts
 
grants wo are often dealing with issues when days count.

Dear Professor Ivers en:
 
ThaYnk you for your interesting letter.
 
I =
enclosing,  in case you haven't seen it,  the current
 
Folk Arts brochure.
 I realize that you say you have already
 
studied the Folk Arts guidelines, but it is possible that
 
you got hold of an t
aut-of-date copy.
 
Your project, however interesting, really does not represent
 
our major priorities.
 We are concerned with the reinforcement
 
by any so me open to us of living cultural models.
 The Folk
 
Arts af
tisory panel has discussed the problem of the individual
 
vernacular artist at length and has concluded that it lies out-
side our area of primary concern.  It is possible, of course,
 
that we may eventually have the funds necessary for such proj-
ects, but that day is not now.
 
I do wish you the best of luck in your search for funding.
 
Perhaps your connections with the Fansas Arts Commission might
 
prove fruitful.
 
Regretfully,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

PSS.  Your pictures are certainly extremely exciting.  Have
 
you thought of just trying for straight-out book publication?
 
I see occasional publications; of the type of material you are
 
documenting.
 I shall return your slides along with this
 
letter in hope that you can use them elsewhere.

To '
Whom It May Concern:
 
In the sur  or of 1975, I tools leave from my position as
 
Professor of Anthropology at California State University at

the Smithsonian Institution's Bicentennial Festival of
 
American Folklife.
 I first met Ralph Samuelson that s

traditional perforaance troupe from Japan, escorting sines
 
25 musicians and dancers through a schedule of appearanews
 
in four or five major U.S. cities.
 
ITie following year, Ralph Rinzler, the Festival Director,
 
and I invited Mr. Sam u
elson to be the field worker, progra:i
 
coordinator and presenter for the Japanese and Japanese-
American week-long program at the 1376 Festival.
 It was
 
daring this period that I had a closer opportunity to observe
 
Mr. Samuelson I a

an organizer of cultural events and an educator as well.
 
I was i

fluently, and was bold in obvious affectdwn by t1w fifty-odd
 
participants he assembled for the program.  His planning and
 
coordination of the :
many factors involved in such a complex

grogram was exemplary.  Finally, he was a competent public
 
speaker, providing a wealth of i
.nforsaation to the visiting
 
public in l
iks careful and well-thought-out introductions of
 
the various secg3
.
 t
ints of the Japanese performance.
 
In personal terms, Fr. Samuelson Droved a pleasant and con-
siderate colleague, ex
ctrcraely hard-working and unflappable.
 
I recoimaend him in the highest terms.

To adequately review these applications, there are many
 
factors that must be taken into consideration.  The legisla-

"
(A)  enabling cultural organizations and institutions
 
to increase the levels of continuing support and to increase
 
the ranee of contributors to the programs of such organiza-

Eugenia Mitchell

The Folk
. Arts Panel review ed p
ia Mitchell's application
 
at their September meeting.  Mrs. Mitchell's application
 
was the first US/UK application that the Folk Arts panel
 
felt that they could c
ent constructively on.
 In the past
 
they have reviewed several US/UK applications which were of
 
very low quality and which were not accompanied by sufficient
 
support materials.
 
The panel unanimously supported Mrs. Mitchell's application.
 
They noted the fine quality of her needlework--romarkable
 
especially for a m
an of her aye.  They felt that Mrs.
 
Mitchell would benefit greatly through her experiences in
 
England.
 l
lie British needlework tradition is quite different
 
from that in this country and the panel felt that Mrs.
 
Mitchell would contribute to the British traditions as
 
well as learn from t
tima as she conducts her studies.
 
The panel also felt that the d
ent's .
supp ort of this
 
application would be an exse 9tf for r
attlers and would aid:  in
 
encouraging the artistic activities of senior citizens in
 
this country.
 And, finally,  they concluded their discussion
 
of the application with the cc mnent that rejecting this
 
application would be rejecting America and apple pie.

Inter-gover m
iental Native American Cultural Project
 
Livingston Biddle
 
At a recent lunch with Herman Viola, director of the Smith-
sonian Anthropological Archives and Alan Jabbour, director
 
of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress,
 
it became clear that all three  of our agencies were concerned
 
with a similar ptoblem : how to increase access for native
 
ricans to their cultural materials housed in various
 
federal repositories . The materials include:
 
a.  Sound cyllinder recordings deposited in the Smith-
sonian, the Library of Congress and the National Archives.
 
Only a limited number have been copied onto tape ; therefore
 
the music recorded (most of it prior to 1920) is inar
_cessi:�le
 
to anybody even assuming that there was a master list indi-
cating which collections were in which archive.
 
b.  Aluminum and acetate discs containing music and
 
recorded oral literature (1930 - 1950 mostly).  Again, these
 
holdings are scattered between the three institutions, with
 
the Library of Congress having the lion's share . Because
 
of their age and fragility , there is an increasingly urgent
 
need to copy more of these recordings onto tape . I under-
stand that the sound archive at L.C. is three years behind
 
in their copyiml orders . Further , because of staff shortages
 
at the Archive of American Folk Song , prpperly detailed
 
cataloguing has been impossible; since 1941, they have only
 
been able for the most  .
art to set up simple accessions
 
lists (e.g. four 2wurs of Kiowa and Cherokee music recorded
 
in Oklahoma).
 
c.  Photographs of Native Americans from the 1880's
 
to the present . Again , all three institutions have extensive
 
holdings.  I do not know the state of their cataloguing or
 
copying procedures.
 
d.  Physical objects (crafts, ceremonial and secular).
 
Almost all of these materials are housed it the Smithsonian
 
which has a pretty good retrieval system on the whole.
 
Livingston Biddle, 1
-
-age 2
.
 
Alan Jabbour, Herman Viola and I have almost weekly confer-
eoces with Native American tribal representatives who are
 
v
oomwWring around Washington looking for various itenm of
 
h eir cultural heritage entrusted to the federal government,
 
Sometimes generations 6 ",  None of us can give these people
 
a clear or cormplete anae w to their legitimate questions.
 
Many of t
iwm represw* small local tribal cultural archives
 
(a number of which v w* gut up by ixw, I believe) ; they have
 
nothing to put in theta.  Typically, they don't want their
 
things back; they just want to '
buy copies of them, in the
 
case of tapes, or to take Onotographs of them, in the case
 
of physical objects.
 
The three of us feel that the glace to start dealing with
 
this ;
problem is with the musical materials.  it seems to us
 
that a project to copy, catalogue and thus s
nake available
 
to tribal members and scholars alike the historical musical
 
materials of native Americans would be an excellent start
 
on the kind of inter-agency cooperation that you have stressed.
 
I can see the following w
eirs actively involved in such
 
an undertakings  both the Arts and Humanities Endowments, the
 
Library of Congress, the 804thimovian Institution, the National
 
Archives, and the Bureau at Indian Affairs.  Each repository,
 
I would imagine, would need special funding in order to locate,
 
catalogue properly and ca n their holdings-
, the project could
 
be coordinated by either
 of the SIA and result in
 
the developrimnt of a master list or catalogue across all the
 
federal archived institutions.
 
An additional consideration is that many of the most important
 
collection& of Indian cultural materials are in private or
 
state institutions.  A 0 11-pt"Aicized project of t
2iis king
 
on t
l
rre federal level � uld be a comWelling model for such
 
institutions. recalling to theta their own responsibility to
 
provide more convenient access to these important artistic
 
materials.
 
I do not have the least idea how much this might cost; it
 
in still in the talk stage.  If you think the notion worth
 
pursuing, I should be glad to investigate the problems and
 
needs futther and provide you with additional information.
 
my impression is that it would wean serious money, and that
 
prolAbly a special approach to the Congress for funding would
 
be necessary.
 
An appropriate occasion for a preliminary discussion of this
 
issue might be the next meeting of the board of the American
 
Folklife Center at the Library of congress on January 25.
 
As you know, you are a statutory t
i
umiber of that board, as is

of the principals, or their deputies, will be p atent.

Dear Professor Arvizu:
 
It was a pleasure to speak with you and your colleagues
 
this afternoon.
 I enclose the materials you asked for:
 
a xerox of your original letter and the two project de-
scriptions; should you need anything else from your orig-
inal package of materials, please don't hesitate to give
 
me another call.
 
I am also forwarding a copq of our Media Arts guidelines
 
and enclosing tow copies of the HKtive American cultural
 
retention checklist (now Imt out in the form of a brochure
 
by the Oklahoma Indian Arts Council).
 I should be very
 
interested in your reaction on the latter item.
 If you
 
think it would be useful in Micronesia, I could get you
 
more copies, I am sure.
 
I shall look forward to receiving your applications.  The
 
deadline for receiving copies of the fiLus and any e"
 c
idi—
 
tional backup Am "rial you would want the panel to see is

Dear Ann:
 
Z am writing on behalf of the Folk Arts Program staff:  Sally
 
Yerkovich, Karen SILlzberger, Marian Dockery and myself--not
 
to mention the numerous m
 mob ws of the Folk Arts panel--to
 
thank you and the Real to Real staff for your gan wouss hospit
 
tality last week.  It was a perfectly lovely ,
panty you gave
 
for us, and welall enjoyed it immensely.  my major regret
 
concerning our Memphis trip was that I didn't gat a chance
 
to come by and sas your facility in operation, but I under-
stand Fred I
,ibeomm had another session with you and your
 
fibs -
makers Sunday morning.
 I hope he was able to be of
 
s we help to you.
 
i
`ur trip was certainly productive, at least as far as we were
 
concerned.  We got a great deal of business done, but, of
 
course, the socializing and the getting to meet ,
,
)eoplea who
 
ware only voices on the tele=:shone before, was the im=portant
 
part.
 
Again, my sincere j
:
>ersonal thanks for your warmth and hospi-
tality.  I am sure I speak for all of us also in wishing
 
you and the Real to Reel staff a hai
.
y holiday season and a
 
productive year to came.

Dear Judy:
 
Please convey the thanks of the entire Polk Arts Program
 
and panel to your staff for their cordial and helpful reception
 
of us during our recent visit to Memphis.  None of you could
 
have conceivably been nicer or more cooperative.  We all felt
 
downright cherished.  The support facilities and all that
 
chaaufferring back and forth -- well, it made it one of our
 
most efficient meetings and we got a real body of work done
 
in addition to all the lovely partying.
 
I hope you all have been able to get rested up a bit since we
 
descended upon you, and that your Christ m
an was merry and
 
your New Year happy.  Best regards from Sally, Karen, Marion
 
and me and all those panel members besides.
 
Affectionately,

I write to offer my formal resignation from the advisory
 
board of Council Grove III.  It se ws that I shall be on
 
the east coast for the foreseeable future, and that I
 
therefore cannot be of any directOserv
vice to the school,
 
which still interests me so such.  I hope you will keep
 
t
he on your mailing list, as I shall look forward to learn-
ing how the school develop*.
 
I am sure you will be able to locate many a
rcs who could
 
take my place on the board in a more active role.  when I
 
accepted I really never expected to stay on the east coast
 
so long.
 
Ralph tells me of the splendid reception of your work by
 
the H M committee.
 I an awfully happy for you, and hope
 
that all goes well for you and Council

in the future.
