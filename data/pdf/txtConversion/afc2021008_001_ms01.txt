Interview conducted remotely via video conferencing software 
Aaron Paige (00:00:00): 
Today is Tuesday, August 17th, 2021. My name is Aaron Page spelling, A A R O N P A I G E. 
And I'm here today with fellow interviewer and folklorist Elinor Levy, spelled E L I N O R L E 
V Y. And today, Elinor and I will be interviewing Eileen McManus as part of an Archie Green 
fellowship titled Community Health Workers in Downstate New York. Eileen, would you please 
state and spell your full name? 
Eileen McManus (00:00:36): 
Sure. My name is Eileen McManus, E I L E E N M C M A N U S. 
Aaron Paige (00:00:45): 
And Eileen, where were you born and where did you grow up? 
Eileen McManus (00:00:48): 
I was born in New York City and grew up in New York City. I was born in the Bronx, close to 
Yankee stadium in Highbridge and over the years in the city, we moved from Highbridge over to 
the Fordham road area. And then, we moved again to upper Manhattan, to the Inwood section, 
and I resided there for most of my life, my early life and I got married there and I had my first 
child while I was still there. And then I moved to Orange County when I was pregnant with my 
second child in 1987. 
Aaron Paige (00:01:35): 
Where do you currently work and what is the general location of where that work is based? 
Eileen McManus (00:01:43): 
Currently I'm working for Sun River Health and I am the Vice President of Operations for the 
Hudson Valley. So that means all of the locations in the Hudson Valley fall to me. And there are 
19 of those locations over seven counties of the Hudson Valley. So from Yonkers New York, all 
the way up into Columbia County, Hudson, New York, and everywhere in between are my 
health centers. Some are large, some are small, some are rural, some are urban, so it's quite a mix 
of communities and needs. 
Aaron Paige (00:02:26): 
Would you please give a brief elevator-type-synopsis of your job description at Sun River Health 
and a more detailed explanation of how that position or how your position relates to, or engages 
with community health workers or migrant outreach workers at Sun River? 
Eileen McManus (00:02:48): 
Sure. So if you talked about my role, you would say, this is somebody who oversees the day-to-
day operations of the provision of health care and the quality of that care throughout our 
organization in this particular region. Again, that's the Hudson Valley. In terms of my connection 
to outreach workers, in my previous role, before coming to Sun River, I was the director of a 
Migrant Head Start program. And of course we were deeply involved with the life of migrant 
and seasonal farmworkers in Orange County. When I came over to Sun River, I came with the 
understanding that migrant health would be an area of focus for me. And I began my career here 
18 years ago, overseeing three locations, two of which were dedicated to migrant and seasonal 
farmworkers. Part of the privilege of working with that community is that you partner very 
directly with outreach workers. 
Eileen McManus (00:04:01): 
They're the ones who transport patients to specialty care into care with us who are able to do a 
home visit and ascertain things that we wouldn't be able to know in an exam room or in a dental 
operatory. They're the linchpin, so to speak, able to identify trends in a community. Say for 
example, there is a high level of Lyme disease frequent in Orange County, and you see that trend 
very clearly. So you're able to equip those outreach workers with the help of the Department of 
Health, maybe with kits to help to remove ticks. These are the people who build intimate 
relationships with those that we serve. So as an administrator, you're not as directly involved in 
the life of patients just as in Migrant Head Start as the director, I was not as directly involved in 
the classroom. But you're the one who is going to make sure that we are deeply connected with 
one another so that the outreach worker is an integral part of the team. 
Eileen McManus (00:05:26): 
And that there's bi-directional communication, if a provider is trying to reach or find a certain 
patient. You are going to be the one who's probably going to know that he's no longer at this 
camp, he's at that camp, or even that he's left the area. Our work, as well, is connected to the 
lives of the growing community. So that means not seeing growers or farmers as something 
separate or other from the community that we're serving. Our desire is to stand on common 
ground in service to others and particularly understanding that good health is in everybody's best 
interest. It's not simply something for us to achieve in terms of the farmworker themselves. We 
want a relationship that allows someone to speak. What we've seen over the years is that it may 
be that a farmworker does not want to say to a grower that they're not feeling well. 
Eileen McManus (00:06:37): 
So much is riding on the job that they have. They don't want to be perceived as sick or, or 
weaker, or in need at that moment because their families back home are relying on that income. 
They are frequently caring for people on another side of the border. And so, helping everyone to 
understand that, how important it is for them to access care and to have relationships where local 
area growers are contacting us. And COVID was a really good example of that. When people 
called us for testing or called us for, as they are right now, I have a group returning to the area. 
Can you come out and do vaccines? And outreach workers are a main catalyst for that. They help 
to ensure that everybody's aware of our operating hours, how many, how many services we 
might have. And they're just like really important people. Does that answer your question? 
Aaron Paige (00:07:48): 
Yeah. Thank you. And we'll return to a number of the things that you're talking about here as 
well later in the interview. We did want to ask a little bit about your work history. You've talked 
a little bit about it already, but would you please talk just briefly about your work history and 
what led you to being in the position that you currently hold? And also if along the way, there 
were any “a ha!” moments where you realized this is the work that I need to do for myself, or 
any other kind of formative experiences that you may have had growing up that led you to this 
position? 
Eileen McManus (00:08:32): 
From my history, I would say I've always been drawn to the not-for-profit sector. Although in 
my very early life, I was working in the for-profit sector. Before coming up to Orange County I 
was actually working for the United Nations. When I came to Orange, we had some challenges 
in our family, and I found myself drawn to other forms of work. So, you know, I'm not a 
teenager. I have a big, long work history. And I will say that in Orange County, among other 
things, I went to work for the Department of Health as an Outreach Worker. They had a program 
called Healthy Neighborhoods, and you would go cold and knock on people's doors and provide 
some education or help and support with what it is they needed. And from the health department, 
I learned the importance of seeing health very holistically. That it wasn't simply a diagnosis, but 
your living conditions and your ability to connect or to find resources in your community, or to, 
to know that you could get a smoke detector and that it needed to work properly. 
Eileen McManus (00:09:54): 
From there, I went to Migrant Head Start. Someone at the health department actually had a part-
time job with Migrant Head Start and said to me, you'd be perfect for this job. And so I 
interviewed there. So this is really the, the most important part, probably of my story is that 
before I went to migrant head start, I didn't know that there was such a thing as migrant and 
seasonal farmworkers. I thought, grew up in the Bronx, vegetables grow in a supermarket. I 
didn't know anything about the fields or that I was surrounded by people. Although I had 
encountered some doing Healthy Neighborhoods. There were some little pockets of migrant and 
seasonal farmworkers living in the city of Middletown. So in Migrant Head Start, this 
community that is often mute and invisible, mirrored my own sense of being mute and invisible. 
Eileen McManus (00:10:57): 
And I found myself almost forced to speak. And so I always say that was the place for me of my 
becoming. So everything was there already, but they were the catalyst and it was later in my life. 
So I was in my forties when that moment occurred. And so everything that is of importance to 
me ties back to that community, which is where I found my voice and where I was able to step 
into who I actually am as a leader and as somebody who experienced this great passion for the 
community itself, recognizing their resourcefulness and their strength and having great 
admiration for who they are, not just what they do. So that's probably the most important part. 
And when I moved into migrant health that passion was already there. 
Elinor Levy (00:12:05): 
What made you decide to leave Head Start and move into, well, what was then, we'll just keep 
calling it Sun River, even though it wasn't Sun River back then. 
Eileen McManus (00:12:19): 
So when I was in Migrant Head Start, I had done some pretty significant work. I had written a 
grant, something I had never done at any time in my life. It was funded. I opened a school in the 
city of Middletown, a second unit, and there were challenges in the environment, certainly when 
that school was up and running and all through my career at Migrant Head Start, I was connected 
with Kathy Brieger who, you know, Eleanor. Correct? And Kathy would come in sometimes on 
a Saturday and see me pounding away at this grant. And at some point I thought, oh, maybe I 
won't be able to stay here forever. And I called Kathy and oh Kathy had called me and I, I called 
her back and I said, I'm not sure. And she was like, I'm taking you to lunch. Let's go. And so her 
eagerness to bring that part of me, I guess, to what was then Hudson River Health Care. And 
she's very persuasive. So she got me with the migrant health part because we had found, you 
know, when working with families that there was room for improvement in terms of health care. 
And it was such an important part. And then I had my own background with the health 
department that said, it's, it's not about a diagnosis, it's about something else or it's about that and 
many other things. So the hope that I could make a larger difference. 
Aaron Paige (00:14:00): 
I'm wondering what your experience was like in the field as a community health worker, 
outreach worker yourself, what that was like, what your, what your day to day was like. Would 
you talk a little bit about that? Your work in the field and then maybe your transition into more 
administrative work. 
Eileen McManus (00:14:21): 
Sure. You know, I think that I was really surprised for the role of a community health worker, for 
the Department of Health, you know, you sit in exam and you read the job description, but 
somehow you don't imagine that it actually means that you're going to go out onto a street and 
knock on people's doors. You know, you somehow think, oh, there must be some other 
mechanism here. But lo and behold, that was the job. And so block by block, I think I was in 
about 2000 homes. So of course some people are answering the door. Others are at work. Two 
thousand I think, was the number that I reached in terms of being able to come into their home 
and talk to them about safe sex and smoke detectors and all kinds of things. Cause we had a 
number of areas of focus and you just discover the wonder of people, right? Every day is a new 
experience. 
Eileen McManus (00:15:37): 
And every person that you meet has a story and those stories are amazing. And so I love stories 
to start with. And you recognize the great privilege of being able to hear those stories and to try 
to help. So I found people from all walks of life. People in their home, dying from cancer. 
People, seventeen migrant and seasonal farmworkers in an apartment designed for a single 
family. People with, people who were seniors that nobody wanted to talk to about safe sex 
because they just assumed they didn't have it. They didn't have sex. So I talked to them about 
safe sex. It was just as varied as could be and you know, I think we all knew in some way that 
really good people live in really bad neighborhoods. And so the places that many services avoid, 
that was your bread and butter. That's where you knew you were going to make the biggest 
difference. People would probably be home. And you're always amazed at the generosity of 
people who don't have much, right? They'll always offer you something. So it was, it was quite 
an amazing experience. I did that for a few years actually. 
Aaron Paige (00:17:16): 
In your position now, are you still able to get into the field? Is that, is that important to your 
current work? 
Eileen McManus (00:17:27): 
So, so in my current role, I am not able to just be in the field. So I have to connect in different 
ways. And in the land of nineteen health centers, because migrant and seasonal farmworkers are 
my point of passion. We serve many special communities, many special populations, people who 
are homeless people with HIV, people in public housing, all of whom are a point of passion for 
someone else, perhaps. So my time has to be divided among many populations. And so my only 
way is to really connect more deeply with the community, besides the relationships that I've 
sustained over time. The families that I worked with in Migrant Head Start, their children are 
now old enough to come and work for me. And so they do, which is a pretty neat thing. So we do 
health fairs or community events. I sustain my connection, like I said, on a local boards. I was 
part of a ministry, a Mustard Seed Migrant Ministry, all throughout my career at Sun River. And 
that ministry no longer exists. And now I'm on the board of the Warwick Area Farmworkers 
Organization. So that keeps you connected to the lives and to the people that we serve, but in a 
different way, not as, not as intimately as if you're an outreach worker, for sure. 
Elinor Levy (00:19:13): 
Do you miss being an outreach worker? 
Eileen McManus (00:19:16): 
I don't, I don't know that I miss it. I think I'm, I'm grateful for the experience that I understand 
completely how it shaped my perspective on the meaning of healthcare, that every, that it 
certainly serves me now as I do more work on social determinants of health in a different way in 
my organization. So I'm having to have a more global impact than that type. And, and when I 
was in Head Start as well, I always felt that no matter what my role is, I might not be having as 
much fun on the floor with the children, but I was always really delighted to be the one to write 
the grant and make sure we had the money to sustain the mission. Not as romantic, but 
something that I can do. 
Elinor Levy (00:20:26): 
It's kind of interesting that you use the word romantic in that respect, because I think we do look 
at that work with a certain, I mean, with a certain level of, of romance in several senses. You 
have to love what you do, but also there's this, there's this sort of romantic in the sense of, I don't 
know, fantasy in a way of, of, you know, making a difference and coming, you know, and being 
there and, and seeing that, and sort of negotiating between those two. 
Eileen McManus (00:21:07): 
And in some ways that's the danger. So when you begin to think about, I serve migrant and 
seasonal farmworkers, and I, and I frequently warn people about this. If you wrap yourself in the 
cloak of altruism, it's pretty heavy, so you better watch out. And that for us, it's not so much that 
you serve migrant and seasonal farmworkers, but do you serve them well? Can you point to the 
health outcomes? Can you tell me the ways in which you are making a difference in all or as 
many aspects of their lives as you can? 
Eileen McManus (00:21:50): 
So, a good example of that is Goshen, where, and you're familiar with Goshen Elinor, right? So 
in that space, you have programming for families. You have a sewing club. You have ESL 
classes. You have homework help for the children. You have a food pantry. You have boxes 
where people can grow their own vegetables. It's the best example we have in our network and 
the totality of our network of really helping people in all aspects of life that we're going to 
impact them. The Department of Labor is there. So from work, to food, to clothing, to language 
support, all of those areas that we're hearing so much about in terms of the social determinants of 
health, all will impact the actual health outcome for these families. So we'll do a diabetes support 
group, or we'll go to the supermarket and read labels if we can, or put things in ways that don't 
have to be read. I'm putting a yellow sticker on your medicine bottle so that you know you take 
one pill in the morning. I'm putting a blue sticker if it's one pill at night. I'm putting a yellow and 
blue sticker if you have to take one in the morning, one at night. So that you don't have to read 
these prescription labels that are not in your language. So lots of things like that. 
Aaron Paige (00:23:27): 
Eileen, who are some of the specific cultural communities that you serve through the migrant 
farmworker outreach worker program at Sun River? 
Eileen McManus (00:23:40): 
So for me in the Hudson Valley, we're focused primarily on Goshen and New Paltz. Although 
we serve farmworkers throughout our network, those two are embedded in agricultural markets 
and the staff is very reflective of the community that we're serving. So we're, we're serving in 
Goshen, primarily, our farmworkers are from Mexico, from the state of Puebla. In New Paltz our 
farmworkers are about an 80-20 split. 80 from Oaxaca in Mexico. And the other 20 are 
Jamaican. There are also pockets of Haitian community members. There are sprinkles of Central 
America as well, Ecuador, Honduras, that we're gonna find in different areas. And, and of 
course, indigenous people, as well as speak indigenous languages. We've certainly encountered 
the stuff that nobody wants to talk about. Families that were either relocated from the border and 
put into communities without resources, without connections, that we've stumbled across 
sometimes. 
Eileen McManus (00:25:13): 
So in Eastern Duchess County is a really good example. It's a very rural area. We do have a farm 
working presence up there, although it's not listed completely as a farm working site. So a child 
gets sick and suddenly we discover that there are ten, twenty, thirty people who have been 
deposited, so to speak, in that particular area. And I think you saw that all across New York and 
many other states as well. And so connections were made. And the child who was sick led us to 
pockets of mostly men who were there with small children. There were no women that we could 
find. And doing movie nights and, some of the staff at the health center not necessarily outreach 
workers, although there is an outreach worker in that particular location, trying to provide a, a 
motherly presence. So whether it was brushing somebody's hair during a movie night that we 
held at the health center, you know, those are things that, that we try to do because we 
understand the physical and emotional impact of policies that are beyond people's control. 
Elinor Levy (00:26:42): 
Just out of curiosity, were you ever able to figure out where the mothers were? 
Eileen McManus (00:26:49): 
No. Sadly, no. It was a mystery. We were never able to get to the bottom of it. We were able to 
help people get what they needed to survive and then offer some small things that could move 
you a little bit, perhaps beyond survival. It could make me cry. So you don't want to do that. 
Elinor Levy (00:27:16): 
I can see that it's, it's painful. 
Eileen McManus (00:27:18): 
It's very challenging. And you see that in, in all of the communities that we serve. So then in 
Rockland County, you might see more day laborers as opposed to people working in the, in the 
camps. So, so there are people everywhere engaged in some form of work. I think new 
immigrants are a huge part of who we serve in the entirety of our network. 
Elinor Levy (00:27:50): 
I wanted to go back and, cause you mentioned that with the populations from Puebla and Oaxaca 
and Jamaica, that you, do you specifically try to match community health workers, you know, so 
if there's someone, a community health worker from Puebla they'll work with the Pueblans? 
Eileen McManus (00:28:12): 
We try to balance our team. We try to have a male and a female. We're not always successful 
because it's difficult to find people for those positions. We try to hire from within the community 
or somebody who has a deep knowledge of the community already. And the balance helps 
because we're transporting both men and women. And sometimes those outreach workers are 
taking you perhaps to specialty care where no one speaks your language. And you're actually in a 
space with that person in the room with them and trying to interpret for that provider. So it could 
be more intimate than, than you might imagine. And sometimes, if you're a woman and you're, 
for example, you're pregnant and you don't want to continue the pregnancy, you may not be 
comfortable being transported somewhere by a male. You'd want to be transported by a female. 
It's not something that we do ourselves. So, that's one thing. And then of course, we're looking 
for somebody who's bilingual, bicultural ideally, who really understands the cultural component. 
Elinor Levy (00:29:40): 
I think that's one thing where Sun River really shines among the many things, is that 
understanding that you're not translating language only, that you're translating culture. 
Eileen McManus (00:29:56): 
We focus a lot throughout our organization on cultural competence for all of our staff, because 
whether you're an outreach worker or you're a patient representative, whoever you may be, 
you're going to encounter people from diverse cultures. And it's important to, it's an important 
commitment on our end to try to really understand if we're going into a community where we're 
going to be working with a culture that's not familiar to us, or as familiar, we will bring 
somebody in to help us to better understand. So when we went into Sullivan County in the 
summer, there's a large Hasidic community there. So it was important for us to understand the 
dynamics in that culture. And so that's what we did. We just brought people in to help us to 
better understand the ins and outs, what would be appropriate or not appropriate. 
Aaron Paige (00:30:58): 
And are those individuals that you're bringing in CHWs or how would you, what's their 
relationship to Sun River? 
Eileen McManus (00:31:09): 
It's going to be somebody who has a deep knowledge of the communities that we're talking 
about. Trying to remember. It's been a few years since we did the one in Sullivan County who 
exactly came in. We can either call in an outside trainer, so to speak, to come, or if we have an 
in-house resource, we can use them. 
Aaron Paige (00:31:30): 
And what's the general process by which you identify outreach workers, whether it's formal or 
informal? And would you maybe share an example of maybe one or two outreach workers that 
you identified and how that relationship sort of came to be? 
Eileen McManus (00:31:55): 
So we'll talk a little bit about Goshen. In Goshen, I have to say that we have in Goshen a 
tremendous stability. I don't have turnover there. I've been here 18 years, and in 18 years, I have 
not had to hire an outreach worker in that particular health center. The people who were there 
before I was there had also been in place for quite some time. So one of them, both of them 
you'll meet, hopefully. Olga, who I mentioned is now a patient navigator, worked in a local area 
packing house. She became a Vista volunteer and an AmeriCorps, and eventually came to work 
for Hudson River in our New Paltz location. She moved down to the Goshen area. And Marilyn 
worked with me in Migrant Head Start as a family and community service coordinator. And so 
she was a natural. 
Eileen McManus (00:33:03): 
She had been working with farmworking families the whole time she was with me. She was a 
known entity. I understood her knowledge, and she was connected not simply to farmworkers 
directly in the area of the health center, but also this kind of diaspora into the city of Middletown 
and the number of families who are here. So she was connected in that way. In New Paltz, there 
has been turnover. So we had a long term, a very long term, outreach worker who decided to 
pursue a degree in social work. He's still working in our organization. And he was, I would say 
probably the premiere outreach worker. His name is Kenny Gould. And, like I said, he remains 
with us. We've had challenges in terms of stability at that location. So during the process of 
interviewing, so for example, Erica, who's working in New Paltz, she's out at the moment 
because she just had a baby. I participated in her interview, she's a farmworker. 
Eileen McManus (00:34:25): 
She was really nervous. I already know that people get really nervous during interviews, but 
people who come to interview for outreach positions tend to be particularly on edge. We don't 
interview just one-on-one. We start that way but then there are a few of us who are going to 
participate. So for me, I could recognize that she would be more comfortable having her 
interview in Spanish. And so we did that. She was able to interview in the language that made 
her feel comfortable. So for us, we knew she came recommended by Kenny who was very 
familiar with all of the farms and growers up in Ulster County. She possessed an in-depth 
knowledge of the community. She knew the back roads into every farm. She cared deeply about 
her community and its wellbeing. Recognizes the value of health care. She has aspirations to 
move in the direction of a medical assistant and who knows what the future would hold after 
that. And we're eager to support her in, in trying to get there. So that's it, an example of 
interviewing, how we find, we look in the community itself as our first step. That's the ideal for 
us. If we're not able to do it over a prolonged period of time, then we change our strategy 
because we need to have someone in place. It's really critical for access to care. And it's a really 
important position. I was going to say, I was going to say in Eastern Duchess the outreach 
worker was here before I was, and I'm here 18 years. So Ed has been a fixture in Eastern 
Duchess for a long, long time. 
Elinor Levy (00:36:28): 
Wow. That that says something about the organization and the work, that people stay and, and 
want to stay. I have a question. I'm not quite sure how to word it, so I'm gonna sort of stumble 
through it. Is there ever, so when you hire someone like Erica, who's coming from the 
community, is there ever an issue that the community feels like she's going to tell all their 
secrets. I don't want to say betrayal, but 
Eileen McManus (00:37:01): 
No, I know what you mean. I know exactly what you mean. I think it's like anything else. 
Relationships take time to build, and there can be a tendency in the community for some gossipy 
talk. We spend a lot of time helping people to understand their role and responsibility in terms of 
that. So it's not just, you know, giving you some kind of lesson in HIPAA. It's really more about 
helping people to understand the sacredness of the relationship between the patient and the 
outreach worker and not just the patient and the provider and that it lasts your whole life. So 
during the interview, that's a, and it's not simply for outreach workers. I have to say we hire from 
within the community in all of our health centers, in every role. And we spend a lot of time 
talking about the implications of what that means in terms of, you know, building trust and 
reassuring people, and even scenarios where you may be transporting more than one person from 
different families at the same time and not wanting to inadvertently reveal somebody's diagnosis 
or anything like that, the reason for their visit. So, so yes, I think you can find those concerns. It 
has not come up for me. I don't think I have, I don't think I have had a complaint in these years 
related to breach of confidentiality in a migrant site. I don't think so. 
Elinor Levy (00:39:04): 
So that actually leads to another question for me. You know, when you've got people who are 
from within the community who become community health workers and maybe know the 
person, has there ever been a situation where they're sitting in on a doctor's visit and it's very 
clear that the patient is not telling the doctor everything and the community health worker knows 
that. And there's some significant piece of information that they know that the doctor needs to 
know that isn't being relayed from the patient. How do they, how does the community health 
worker deal with that situation? 
Eileen McManus (00:39:45): 
So at Sun River Elinor, so we train, formally train you to be a medical interpreter. It's not like 
you're expected to run into that room and begin doing these things without any training or 
support. So it's a, it was at one point a six week program and when you're a medical interpreter 
and that's the role that you're taking. You have to convey exactly what the person said and 
exactly what the provider said. You're not allowed to fill in your own thoughts. You have to do 
that. So, so you may want to think about a time that perhaps you went to a provider and you 
weren't a hundred percent forthcoming and grateful that somebody wasn't in the room to blow up 
your spot, you know? Yeah. I did see you smoke a cigarette. 
Elinor Levy (00:40:46): 
So, but I can imagine it can be hard when they're with, I guess I think it would because I have to, 
I attend my parents, I attend all their, or one of us attends all their medical appointments and I, I 
guess it's different when it's your parents and I do call them out, but it must, you know, I could 
imagine it being hard sometimes when there's this one piece of information that could make all 
the difference and you can't, you can't do anything about it. 
Eileen McManus (00:41:18): 
Right. And I think the other thing is that this is a group that tends to be, want to be as helpful as 
possible. And so would I say that it has never in the history of that happened, I'm not in every 
medical appointment and every room aware of every temptation that people have, but I do know 
that we work really hard to equip people with a good, strong sense of the importance of 
performing that role exactly as it should be, you know, from who you should be looking at, who 
the provider should be looking at, as opposed to, you know, like you're in the background type-
of-thing. And what your role is exactly. 
Elinor Levy (00:42:10): 
So that actually leads to a question about training for the community health workers. And then 
adjacently, even though that's not our focus, I'm interested about the training that, that the 
doctors and the other medical personnel at Sun River get in that same respect. 
Eileen McManus (00:42:28): 
Okay. So it's going to run the gamut for community health workers or outreach workers. And the 
training will be in a number of areas. So you might look at transportation as one aspect. So we 
need you to take defensive driving. We need that to be certified. We need you to know how you 
need to document. You need to be familiar with our protocols. You need to understand that you 
cannot transport someone in your own vehicle, et cetera. The EMR, how do you document in the 
electronic medical record? All of that will be covered. Health education opportunities. How can 
we train you to better support patients in the land of health education? So some limited work that 
you might do, because you're not a health care professional, we're going to always use customer 
service skills for all of our staff training in that area. 
Eileen McManus (00:43:40): 
And then anything that we may need to begin to develop besides the EMR. There may be other 
technology based tracking mechanisms. So we report out, we create reports for funding sources, 
and we need to know things like how many people have you transported and how many have you 
gone to visit in your home, in their home? And how many have you provided interpretation 
services for? We need to know all that information and we need to learn how to track that. So 
some training can be formal and some can be informal. So as we take you out to the community 
and begin to introduce you, if you don't already know local area growers, visits to the camps, 
new workers coming into the area, how to build those relationships. We try as well, we've been 
unsuccessful during COVID, to bring outreach workers together twice a season, twice a year, 
pre-season and post-season to talk about upcoming, if it's post-season, any trends that we could 
identify, any areas of special need or focus. 
Eileen McManus (00:45:06): 
And if it's pre-season and we're aware of trends, preparing the team for what they may encounter. 
We want them as well to be connected to community partners, community resources. So whether 
that's Migrant Head Start, we want to be a presence at those parent meetings. We want to sit on 
their health services advisory committee, migrant education, the local department of health, local 
area resources in terms of churches, food pantries, et cetera. So building those community 
resource bases as well is something that we will cover with people. And then there's cultural 
competence. There's medical interpreter training. There's a whole host of trainings. Providers, of 
course, we're looking for providers who are bilingual bicultural. Uh, can be more challenging on 
the bicultural part. 
Eileen McManus (00:46:10): 
Sometimes we've been successful. We had a provider who had started, he was born in Peru and 
began his career in the mountains in Peru. Certainly had a different sensibility about working 
with migrant and seasonal farmworkers. We've had a provider whose, whose dad was also from 
Peru, and was a dentist, I think, in Peru. And he had a different sense of the needs of the 
community based on that. Our current providers all speak Spanish. So they're all bilingual and, 
the team itself, for the most part as well, the support team, is bilingual, bicultural. They are able 
to understand the importance of medical interpretation, whether we have to use a device or 
there's a person available to help with that if needed. It cuts down a lot on the need for 
interpretation, if you already speak the language. So both in New Paltz and in Goshen, the 
providers, all providers present, except the dental providers, speak Spanish. 
Aaron Paige (00:47:34): 
The last time that we spoke Eileen, you had mentioned a buddy system that was created where 
outreach workers would kind of shadow incoming outreach workers who were in training. 
Would you speak a little bit about mentorship in CHW work and the role of mentorship in your 
own kind of training program? 
Eileen McManus (00:48:01): 
Yep. I would say that for me, that's probably the most important aspect for any position at any 
level. So it's something that I use, whether I hire a new health center director, I buddy people up 
so that you have a safe space to go to and to talk about the reality, not the theory of the work that 
you're doing. So we will bring, for example, a new outreach worker from New Paltz down to 
spend time with our more seasoned veterans in Goshen. And that's time dependent. You know, 
maybe they need more than a week of doing that. And then that person becomes your lifeline, 
even though you have an immediate supervisor. My own sense is that people crave, not so much, 
it's not that it's unsafe, but your supervisor is undoubtedly really busy. We don't have one that 
oversees one location. You may not be able to reach them in the moment that you're trying to 
reach them, that you have somewhere to turn to ask even the question that says "oh my goodness, 
my supervisor told me ten times how to fill out this form and I can't remember." 
Eileen McManus (00:49:28): 
So that's what I mean by a safe space, to say, "can you help me to remember how to do that?" 
And it's always valuable from my perspective to partner people with somebody who has been 
there and done that because when you're first coming in, everything feels so new and it can really 
feel overwhelming in the beginning. You're learning so much from, you know, what road to take 
to the language of health care. I can remember coming into Migrant Health and thinking I have 
to learn a whole new language and not wanting to sound stupid. Right? So when people were 
saying hemoglobin A1C, the first couple of times, I would say, is it A1C? Is it AC1? Not 
wanting to just say the words out loud. And of course over time it becomes a second nature. So 
they're learning quite a bit in those beginning stages. And, and from my point of view, it's helpful 
to both parties. You want to feel that you've really developed an entire skill set that's valuable 
and that you can help to grow people in your own field. It's a good feeling for the most part. So 
I've never created a system where the buddies weren't happy to be together. 
Aaron Paige (00:51:02): 
What's the organizational structure look like? Are you the direct supervisor of the outreach 
workers and then who is under you and, and sort of what does the administrative structure look 
like? 
Eileen McManus (00:51:17): 
So I'm a Vice President and reporting to me, among others, are what we call Health Center 
Directors. So those Health Center Directors are responsible for X number of locations. So can be 
two up to five is the most. And those Health Center Directors, everyone on the team technically 
reports to them. But you break those reports down a little bit, and we have what's called an 
Operations Manager and the Outreach Workers report directly to him or to her. So it's the 
Outreach Worker to the Operations Manager, the Operations Manager to the Health Center 
Director, the Health Center Director to the Vice President. So you remember, I started as an 
operations manager, so they all reported to me. And at that time it was a limited number of sites. 
So when I came into the network, I had three, then four, then six, then ten, and now nineteen. 
Elinor Levy (00:52:32): 
I want to go back to sort of the training. It's a two-part question. A, how long is a new person in 
"training" and what are the sort of the continuing professional development requirements 
opportunities, slash opportunities. 
Eileen McManus (00:52:57): 
Good question. So generally, if we do have an opening and New Paltz is the example that I 
would use, we're going to want to help you to get on the road as quickly as possible. So if you're 
hired, you go through an orientation and then you have several training days that week where 
you're learning about the EMR, and you're learning about customer service and you're learning a 
few other things. And then for the next six weeks on Friday mornings, you are going to be doing 
a training via Zoom on different aspects of our organization, because we want you to know who 
we are and what we do. Some of it is covered during the orientation session, which is a full day, 
and then over the course of the next few weeks, because that's so much information. Over the 
course of the next few weeks, many of those topics will be fleshed out in these kind-of sessions, 
training sessions. Then when you're arriving at the site, we're going to team you up with a worker 
who's there already, the one who's already working at the site, if possible. 
Eileen McManus (00:54:16): 
Right now we have, our seasoned worker there is out on FMLA because of the baby. So we need 
to make other arrangements. So it's going to depend a little bit on your need. How many times 
either that person can come to you, because Olga has been helping us in New Paltz even though 
she no longer has that role, or you will be coming down to another location to go out and kind-of 
understand the dynamics and how you're interacting with local area growers. Every year, we will 
have mandated in-services training for all staff, not just outreach workers. So everyone is 
covered. And that covers an enormous number of topics from sexual harassment to safety in the 
workplace. And then, not so much during COVID because that affected everything, including 
our ability to train, to bring people together, even just to find the time to do it, there'd be ongoing 
training on any number of topics. Usually whatever is relevant in the organization at the time. So 
if we're rolling out a new referral process, for example, which you are to include our outreach 
workers in that type of training. 
Eileen McManus (00:55:58): 
Every now and again, we have some invitations to participate... and it's generally outreach 
workers, as you know, are almost always booked pretty solid. And the understanding that they 
have, that getting people to care is really important, can sometimes impact their willingness to 
put that time aside for their own personal growth and development. So Olga is an example of 
somebody who came in as an outreach worker and is now a patient navigator. Many of the 
people who come in to do this work...and Kenny is another example of somebody who came in 
as an outreach worker and became a social worker. Many of them really love what they do and 
don't look to do anything else. Erica from New Paltz is an example of somebody who is looking 
to have a future in health care as something other than an outreach worker. So we'll try to support 
that growth and development for her. 
Elinor Levy (00:57:23): 
What mechanisms are there to, cause you've mentioned, sometimes they don't want to, you 
know, they have to transport a patient, they don't want to give up that time to go to a training. 
What mechanisms are in place to help them maintain a healthy balance between this work, which 
can be so consuming and so important that you can neglect your own personal health, both 
mental, physical, cultural, all of those things. 
Eileen McManus (00:58:01): 
Right. That's the, I think that's the saga for everyone now engaged in health care. It's the million 
dollar question. How can I sustain balance? We struggled with it pre-COVID and then certainly 
during COVID, and at this time. We all struggle with it. There's a lot to do, and there's a finite 
number of resources. Were short-staffed everywhere in our network. So for outreach workers, 
when we're looking to create a space, for example, for those meetings that take place twice a 
year, that we have not had in a year's time, we try to plan far enough in advance so that we can 
block the transportation schedule. And so you are not going to feel torn between getting Esmay 
to an appointment and attending this meeting because that tension can really be challenging for 
people. And we understand that. If the training is mandatory, we're going to try to do the same 
thing. We're going to block that time. We do have mandated trainings every year and we will 
help you to schedule so that you're able to partake in those trainings. 
Eileen McManus (00:59:29): 
They're required for you as an employee and it's our obligation to make sure that you have 
enough space. We try to use as many resources as possible. We have an employee assistance 
program. At any moment in anyone's life, things happen and you can find yourself completely 
overwhelmed. I think since the start of the pandemic, many people have felt overwhelmed most 
days of the week and there haven't been any exceptions to that. I would say, probably at the start, 
the challenge for outreach workers was that they were not actually bringing people in as we 
move towards telemedicine in the community, which has been pretty successful. We had to put 
in special protocols for transport and limit the number of people in the reception areas, which are 
quite small to start with. Testing in a parking lot, as opposed to testing inside. Everything 
changed in terms of what their workload was. And then suddenly they were like, "Hey, I'm not, 
I'm not taking people to the hospital because the specialist no longer is providing the service at 
the beginning of COVID." And then came the tremendous focus on testing, which we were able 
to do at camps and packing houses, using a mobile unit. And now the vaccines. So we're busier 
than ever in terms of getting people in for care, as well as getting them vaccinated on at the sites, 
at farms and packing houses. 
Elinor Levy (01:01:23): 
This is sort of a weird follow-up question, but at Arts-Mid-Hudson where I work, my boss is 
absolutely adamant that we take our vacations every year. She doesn't allow us to actually hoard 
vacation days from year to year. And she, the last six months, she noted that all of us have way 
too much sick leave. And because we have, you know, our work is different in importance than 
health, but that, you know, we do have a tendency, especially during COVID, just to work while 
we're sick. And she's like, I don't want you to do that. Does Sun River, you know, sort of enforce 
that you need to take time off, you need to take your vacation. Obviously as a health org you 
should know if you're sick, you can't come in, but 
Eileen McManus (01:02:10): 
Yeah, right. We do. Certainly we tell people if you're sick, please do not come in primarily, you 
know for own safeguard, your own well-being, but the well-being of others, including the 
patients that they really care about. You, you can't, you can't do that. In terms of vacation, we cap 
the vacation. So you can only build to a certain point and then you won't build anymore. So if 
you'd like to give your time away, and most people don't want to give their time away. So I 
would say that we have, we've certainly struggled because of the staffing shortages, but we work 
really hard to make sure that we give the message that if you are not taking care of yourself, you 
are not going to be able to take care of others, your family, or the patients at Sun River, that it's a 
really important thing to be able to prioritize. And at this moment, I don't think I have anybody 
with a lot of time on the books, except maybe a few managers. 
Aaron Paige (01:03:25): 
I had another question about continuity of care. You know, with migrant farmworker outreach, 
the population that you're serving is often moving across great geographic distances. So do you, 
and how do you aim to create continuity of care? Do you work with other FQHCs? What kind of 
partnerships are in place to build kind of integrated health care outreach efforts across region? 
Does that happen? And what's your involvement with that if it does? 
Eileen McManus (01:03:56): 
I would say there are mechanisms in place. How well they're used? I don't know that I could 
attest to that. You'd probably need somebody with more expertise in gathering data on that 
particular aspect. So we know that continuity of care is a huge issue and that whether you're 
talking about Migrant Head Start, or you're talking about migrant health, not everyone is going 
to, not every location that you move into is going to have a migrant health center readily 
available for you. Or if you're lucky, you're going home and you're going to get care there. And 
you know, that's a whole other ball game in terms of, if you're returning, for example, to Mexico. 
We certainly are able to communicate with any other health care provider and ensure that your 
records could be sent there with your permission. What we've done in the past, is on occasion, 
and when I say we, I don't mean me, a health care provider who recognizes that perhaps you're 
going to be going back home for the next six months will make sure that you have a script that's 
going to sustain your medication over that period of time. 
Eileen McManus (01:05:30): 
So generally speaking, if we wanted to see you in three months, and we know that we can't, we'll 
extend the life of that script so that you're covered for that amount of time. We have found 
certainly since 9/11, that there are fewer people active in the migration piece, right? Moving 
from place to place. We have a pretty large base that stays in place, still working in agriculture. 
Ulster County remains the place probably with the most movement in and out of the area. If 
you're an H-2A worker, you're entitled to insurance. So that's something as well that you're able 
to use. A lot of the H-2A workers of course, are going to return home. So they may be in that 
batch of people who need an extended script. I can't think of anything that's more important for 
some of our really medically vulnerable patients than continuity of care. We also don't hesitate, 
in the event that we need to contact, for example, someone in Mexico, because we can't 
understand your immunization record and we want to get it right, we'll pick up the phone and 
we'll call. There's nothing that stops us from trying to make those connections. So nobody says, 
oh my goodness, that's a long distance call, you can't do that. We'll do whatever it is we can in 
order to make connections about what has happened, what has transpired for you and what 
somebody else may need to know. 
Elinor Levy (01:07:36): 
Do you have, so I know some migrant farmworkers, you know, I mean, I guess it's kind of nice 
to hear that you can, at least in the Hudson Valley, you can sort of move around the Hudson 
Valley, which keeps them in quote-unquote network. But do you maintain connections with 
organizations up and down the east coast? So if they move into Maine, Maine is probably a little 
too far, you know, Massachusetts, 
Eileen McManus (01:08:00): 
No Maine is accurate. We actually, at one point we were engaged in, and I may have mentioned 
this, an occupational injury prevention project sponsored by the CDC and NYCAM New York 
Center for Agricultural Medicine and Health. The project ran in Orange County and in Maine 
with the blueberry crops. So we certainly have a large network. So there's Migrant Clinicians 
Network, and other entities that work on behalf of that, of migrant health, in terms of connecting 
people across entities. We are certainly partnered with those in New York State, Finger Lakes, 
for example, and other areas and other federally qualified health centers in New York State who 
serve migrant and seasonal farmworkers. And then all of those migrant entities that I mentioned 
earlier that we connect with as well. So Migrant Head Start doesn't operate strictly in New York. 
These are farmworkers and their families who will be possibly moving to Michigan or down to 
Florida, or who are following the crops along the east coast. So yeah, we're, we're connected in 
those, in those ways as well. 
Aaron Paige (01:09:27): 
Eileen, I have a question that relates a little bit to the work that Elinor and I do, which is in folk 
and traditional arts. And last time we spoke, you had mentioned a project, I think it was called 
Under My Sombrero. I'm wondering if maybe you'd speak a little bit about that project and how 
that sort of came into being, but also any other projects related to traditional cultural expressions 
that have been important to the work that you do and the work that outreach workers are 
involved in. 
Eileen McManus (01:10:01): 
So I can talk about Under My Sombrero. And there was another project that I did, a mental 
health project when I was in Migrant Head Start. So let me start with Under My Sombrero. So I 
was new to migrant health. I came in actually on Cinco de Mayo, visiting the health centers and a 
young farmworker came up to me to say, there is nothing that we can do after work and that's 
why there's, sometimes there's trouble. Drinking or fighting. And within a week, a woman 
walked through the door and said, I'm from Arts for Orange and we would really like to fund a 
project related to migrant and seasonal farmworkers. And I was like, okay, so the gods are 
speaking. What the heck? How often could you imagine something like that would happen? I 
knew one artist. She had worked with me in Migrant Head Start. She was an art therapist. She's 
since moved out of the country. She had helped the families create a mural because when I went 
into Migrant Head Start, there, there didn't appear to me to be any reflections on the wall of the 
people we were serving. 
Eileen McManus (01:11:35): 
So she helped those parents create a mural. And so she was the only artist really. And so I 
reached out to her to say, “Hey, somebody said, there's an opportunity here.” And she was open 
to it. And she had worked with members of the community, some farmworking men and women 
in her studio doing pottery. So for me, the first step was always going to be to find the voice of 
the community. So I needed to go out and begin to ask people if there was something available 
for you to do, what would it be? And so those three areas came up, of painting, of music, and 
some of them were already familiar with pottery. So Judy, who was the initial artist, had 
identified two other women. They happened to be women in the community. One was another art 
therapist and the other one was a musician. And so that's how we started. And we got together to 
try to draft what we thought would be a fundable project. I don't think we realized how much 
work it was going to be. So for me, I had written a grant before, so it was like, not that big a deal, 
and it was a small amount of money. And so we brainstormed what we might be able to do. And 
because it was Orange County, most of the workers were from Puebla. 
Eileen McManus (01:13:15): 
So we talked about what it could look like and about what we would hope to achieve. And at that 
point, I was also working with Mustard Seed Migrant Ministry. And I was working with a group 
of young girls who were learning dance from Mexico and the costumes, all of it. So we knew we 
could incorporate them as well. And so our plan was to, with pottery, recreate a scene from the 
village. For the painting, it was a mural that could be taken out. It had to be something that we 
could move. It couldn't be on a wall in your traditional sense of a mural. And we got guitars 
from, I can't remember the name of the place that...You may hear my dog bark for a second. 
Sorry. Someone's coming to the door. Got guitars and used music from Puebla as well. And so 
we knew that we wanted to take the work that we did out into the community, and we thought we 
would use three venues. One mainstream, and that was the public library. So we did a show there 
and we talked about, and of course it was not just the artists, but the people who had participated 
and it was a diverse group that participated. It wasn't simply farmworkers. It was farmworkers 
seated beside somebody else who was interested in participating. And even though they couldn't 
speak the same language, they were smiling and they were engaged. And it overall was a pretty 
positive experience. 
Eileen McManus (01:15:13): 
And I think the most important piece for me was when it ended. So no more money, you have 
your grand finale, the music continued. So the men would gather on the porch or somewhere in 
the community and continue to sing and compose and perform for others. And it was, it was 
pretty terrific. So part of that came from my own experience when I was in Migrant Head Start. I 
had been approached to participate in a mental health project. So the mental health project was 
designed to capture the stories of people who had come to the United States. Sadly, I was the 
videographer. I have absolutely no skills in that area. We formulated, with the help of a social 
worker from New Mexico, a questionnaire. The goal was to begin to talk about their story of 
coming into the United States and to help to cast them as the hero of their own story. To kind of 
move through that thread of how were you able to endure, thrive, make it, all of those pieces. So 
you needed a big box of tissues. Somebody who worked with me was a health coordinator who 
now actually is the health center director of the migrant site, she followed me into migrant 
health, was the one who conducted the interviews. The stories, of course, were extraordinary. 
But the work became used to support the notion that the narrative approach to working with 
people had significant benefits over some form of a questionnaire. So it became a very academic 
work in the end, although it was shown at conferences related to mental health. And it is the 
space that certainly taught me a lot about understanding the importance of people identifying for 
themselves, what they want and need, and the importance of helping people to understand that 
they are indeed the heroes of their own story. So I've carried that with me. I use it all the time in 
my work, in my life. That's for sure. 
Elinor Levy (01:18:33): 
Have either of those programs been done again? 
Eileen McManus (01:18:38): 
Not that I know of. I have not. The migration stories, they became the property of some entity in 
Washington, DC. I remember when I first came into Sun River, I was asked to go to Washington 
and I did. It became, like I said, more academic than anything else, and I never kept a copy of the 
work that we did. I can tell you, it, it resulted in a pretty nice film. I don't know that I could ever 
find it. 
Elinor Levy (01:19:19): 
Oh, I bet Aaron and I could find it. 
Eileen McManus (01:19:31): 
It was a long time ago. 
Elinor Levy (01:19:31): 
It doesn't matter. Are those two programs that you would like to see return? 
Eileen McManus (01:19:38): 
Well, I would say that there are opportunities for people to share their stories. And I think that 
we all recognize the importance of doing that. I would say with the migration stories, you're 
talking about stories that have oftentimes many traumatic events incorporated into those stories. 
So we had the advantage of having a mental health professional readily available for those 
families after they shared their stories. And I think that that's a little bit different than maybe 
what you're hearing on NPR, if I'm telling my story and yeah. Do I think that people benefited 
from them? I do. I think that they did benefit from them. That in many instances they were able 
to really understand how heroic they are. 
Elinor Levy (01:20:45): 
And sometimes telling, being able to tell that story to other people makes you realize that you're 
not alone. 
Eileen McManus (01:20:55): 
Yeah. 
Elinor Levy (01:20:56): 
You know, we have this, we have this tendency, not, you know, I'm sure they have a tendency 
because of the work they do and, and the lives they lead that they don't always talk, but I've 
discovered lately in my life, and I turned 60 to figure this out, it's like, I'm not the only person 
who experiences this thing that feels very personal and makes me feel very alone and, and a 
random comment from just like, oh my God, you go through that too? has made a huge 
difference for me. So, you know, I see the value of having that program and having a...I worked 
in metal...before I came to folklore I worked in mental health. 
Eileen McManus (01:21:39): 
Yeah, I mean, I think the challenge for the Arts for Orange program was that it could not be a 
mental health project. Although I understood that once you engaged people in that way, you 
were providing that. They were going to feel connected and part of a community. So for me, 
there's a commitment to what I define as mental health in a natural setting. So whether that's a 
soccer league or a sewing club, or an arts project, or whatever it may be, mental health in a 
natural setting is something that could be provided because the cost of mental health services, I 
mean, if you just imagine somebody on Medicaid even, trying to get mental health services, now 
you're looking at people who are completely undocumented. 
Elinor Levy (01:22:34): 
Right. And the stigma and the continuing stigma of mental health. Man we should talk, we 
should talk off camera sometime because I think Aaron would agree that the landscape has 
changed and funders see the value of connecting mental health and art and mental health and 
narrative storytelling. And what about the other project, Under My Sombrero, is that another 
project that 
Eileen McManus (01:23:05): 
I think that there's value in, you know, the name came from this idea that if you look out in the 
fields in black dirt and you see that the men or women under this sombrero, that there's a whole 
actual identity and cultural heritage under there. So we knew that many people in that 
community are very gifted artistically, and like many immigrant families, right, for their children 
who are talented, those first generations want you to do something practical. And something 
practical is not being an artist or an actor or a dancer. It's getting married and having children. 
You know, there's that cultural tension between the first-generation immigrant and the 
aspirations of somebody who may have been raised in the American system. So, there's 
definitely, there was definitely a desire on my part to say, wow, here is another aspect of the 
person that you're looking at that you might not have imagined and how rich that cultural 
heritage is, their artistic heritage. 
Elinor Levy (01:24:42): 
We're coming up on wanting to sort of wrap things up cause we know you a busy, busy time 
ahead of you and we so appreciate your time. What was your, I guess, biggest challenge slash 
greatest accomplishment? It might be the same thing or two different things? 
Eileen McManus (01:24:58): 
In terms of? 
Aaron Paige (01:25:01): 
I guess it could be your work in the position that you're in now, or your work in the field. I mean, 
really at any capacity in your career in health care and specifically around community health 
work, your greatest challenge that you've faced and or accomplishment. 
Eileen McManus (01:25:28): 
Okay. So, I think that there are a lot of challenges. I think some of the challenges that I 
encountered came from the dominant culture and the inability to understand or recognize the 
talents of others. And I'm a member of that culture. So that makes it really hard. So you want to 
be the white face in the room and talk smack about white people. So you can't kind of do that. So 
if I were invited, for example, to a local community college, to talk about access to college for 
the children of farmworkers who may or may not be documented, you know, I would always 
have to say that I'm a filter and that you're not hearing the authentic voice, and it's hard to be a 
filter because that's not what you want. You really want people to know that there are others that 
they could talk to. And even if they had to use an interpreter that hearing the unfiltered voice is 
really important, and that we don't want to downplay the fact that being that filter served me and 
hopefully served others to some degree. But I think that that's always been a big challenge. And I 
remember in Orange County, in particular, I needed a nurse in my Migrant Head Start program. 
Of course I wanted somebody who spoke the language and understood the community. And 
people just blatantly told me there was no such thing, that they just completely disregarded the 
fact that there are many talented men and women all around them, just looking for an 
opportunity.  
Eileen McManus (01:27:29): 
They may not speak English as perfectly as you do, but they're smart and they're talented and 
they're dedicated and they're giving. So that I think has always been a challenge and, you know, 
understanding that you can inadvertently enable the dominant culture to remain unresponsive to 
the needs of the community. So those very acts that you're performing of interpretation or 
translation, going into that provider's office, they're not looking then to fill that role with a 
bilingual person. So you're always thinking about those things, or at least I am. And I talk about 
them often. In terms of accomplishments, I would say the projects that I talked about certainly 
were accomplishments for me and those moments of feeling connected to the community as 
well. So Elinor, you had asked me about my own connections and some of the ones that were 
formed during my years in Migrant Head Start, so I would say that there were times that I would 
be invited to a party in the black dirt, in a camp, under the stars, people dancing, a hole in the 
ground to make the food. Those were big moments for me. And certainly I hold on to those 
moments. Listening to the stories that people told, as well their migration stories were pretty 
powerful. Really moving stories. So I would say those connections are what's most important to 
me. You know, not so much the tasks, but the relationships. 
Aaron Paige (01:29:32): 
Well, I'm now I'm actually getting a little emotional here. I guess, maybe one parting question 
would be, what are your hopes and your vision for the growth of this program, the migrant 
farmworker outreach program at Sun River, but also this work beyond Sun River, and in 
healthcare kind of more broadly, in the United States? 
Eileen McManus (01:30:06): 
So I think what I hope for is that at some point we will have the wisdom to change policies that 
negatively impact others. It's going to make me cry. So I would hope that we would kind of get 
it, that good health is in everybody's best interest. That good health is broad-based that it should 
be a right for everybody who's here and not a privilege, and that we could help people in ways 
that are practical and sometimes in ways that are impractical, if that makes sense to you. So some 
people would view an arts project as not a practical thing or a real need, but I could tell you that 
it is.
