 There may be some interest in the average degree
 
of overall indulgence or severity in the treatment of all
 
kinds of behavior on the part of children.

 "
Indeed,  the culture of middle-class
  
Europeans and Americans probably exerts more severe pres-
sure upon the child... than does the culture of any other
 
people in the world.'....

trusted for this present purpose, Davis & Havighurst have
 
exaggerated, byt only a little, in their judgment of the
 
severity of (
socialization) pressure put upon children
 
in the American middle c1ass.i
