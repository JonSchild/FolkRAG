Field Notes 
Pre-Interview 
The closure of the Canadian-US border due to the pandemic has had a major impact on communities on 
both sides of the river: Western New York and Southern Ontario have a very close connection, especially 
the Buffalo-Niagara region. There’s even a mural to Gord Downie in Buffalo (and the Buffalo Bison’s 
parent org. is the Toronto Blue Jays, who have been playing at Sahlen Field in Buffalo during the 
pandemic), and in the summer you’re just as likely to see Ontario license plates as you are New York 
license plates, especially in the shopping district of Niagara Falls, NY. Both Buffalo and Niagara Co. have 
their own connections to Ontario, but Niagara County communities – especially along the river like 
Lewiston, Porter (Ransomville and Youngstown), and Niagara Falls – have an extremely close one, with 
families, doctors, and friends spread across both sides of the border. For distance perspective, living in 
Lewiston it’s closer for me to drive to Canada (5 mins to the bridge) than it is to Niagara Falls (15 mins to 
downtown), and vice versa (though border crossing is another story). Of the current 4 bridge crossings 
connecting Ontario to WNY, 3 of them are in Niagara County (Rainbow Bridge, Whirlpool Bridge, and the 
Lewiston-Queenston).  
A great case study to look at the close relationship is in the dirt track racing community of Western New 
York and Southern Ontario: both major dirt tracks in the area, Merritville and Ransomville, were both 
owned at one point by the Friesen family for over 40 years, a racing family that goes back generations 
and continues to this day, with Stewart Friesen (who currently competes in NASCAR trucks).  And in folks 
and drivers like Peter Bicknell of St. Catharine’s, who race weekly on both sides of the border (asides 
from Niagara and Erie County: Peter Bicknell is also the founder of Bicknell Racing Products, one of the 
major manufacturers of modifieds in the world, and who have locations in St. Catharine’s, Ontario and 
Niagara Falls, NY. 
I set the date for the remote interview using Zencastr with Peter the week before in my follow up to our 
phone conversation the month before about the project: as they’re in the middle of moving things and 
updating the machine shop at BRP, he felt it was better to get into the schedule the week ahead rather 
than seeing how the following week is going to turn out.  
I gave Peter a call the day before to just confirm Wednesday, July 7th @ 2:30pm still worked for him, and 
it did so we were still on for then.  
On July 7th, once 2:45 rolled around I suspected something had happened and was up, and I gave Peter a 
call just to check that we were still on: it turns out my email with the link to the Zencastr interview 
where we would be doing the recording, had gotten filtered through to his spam folder. So he was still 
waiting on the link & thought I hadn’t sent it yet! But I stayed on the phone with him while he found it in 
his spam folder, and then we were able to get it setup and rolling just before 3pm.  
Before the interview, we just did a microphone check (I used my H5 hooked up to the computer on my 
end) and sound quality check, and then talked about how Zencastr works (with the uploading to the 
cloud after) and the release form will be emailing, and a copy of the interview as well. Once we were all 
set we then jumped right in to the interview.  
Interview 
Knowing that Pete brought decades of experience both in the building and manufacturing of cars, I 
decided going into the interview that we’d structure it by spending the first half of the interview to talk 
about his building of cars and how that evolved into Bicknell Racing Products, one of the major 
manufacturers of modifieds in the world. Peter started out by talking about his early memories and 
exposure to dirt track racing, and how he got his start in building cars. Pete spoke about how building a 
race car with his friend as part of a high school project and racing it, evolved into building cars for 
others, and then how that eventually grew into Bicknell Racing Products: which currently builds just 
about everything from the groundup. After having some difficulty sourcing the parts and getting 
everything in on time in the 80s and 90s, BRP shifted to becoming a full fledged machine shop 
component where they could create in-house any part they needed.. 
Peter talked about the current structure of BRP and his partnerships: Pete basically handles the machine 
shop side of things with Bob Slack (who designed the Slack kart chassis which was then sold to Jody 
Herriven & co. who still operate out of Middleport, NY as Performance Manufacturing) and Randy 
Williamson who oversees and builds the chassis and modifieds. These three parts of BRP are on the 
Canadian side, where on the Niagara Falls, NY side that is a retail warehouse run by his son-in-law and 
daughter: Peter estimated that about 90% of their sales actually are on the US side, and through that US 
storefront it also has sold as far away as Australia and New Zealand. Peter estimated that on any given 
weekend, there are around 1,000 Bicknell built cars racing around the US & Canada: Bicknell is one of 
the main/major producers of modified chassis in Dirt especially.  
Peter spoke about the impact Covid has had on BRP, that although their chassis manufacturing is up 
(2020 they built around 250, 2021 they’re on track for building 310), there is a tire shortage, a racing 
fuel shortage, a raw material shortage, supply chain issues, etc.: that has made manufacturing really 
challenging.  
Peter talked about how new designs for chassis are coming up, and one of the major changes being in 
the last four years the move to short link coil suspension from the older tension bar style: which 
drastically has changed how the cars handle and how they can bite into the corners. Designs and 
modifications and experimentations like this before a design is rolled out is carried out by select drivers 
or by themselves in their cars racing, before they bring it to market: Peter said this is because sometimes 
an idea or design they had turns out to be a dud. In the case of moving to the short link coil suspensions 
in the rear, Peter actually felt that a lot of old timers like himself didn’t really like it and he put off 
moving over to it for a number of years because it was very different from driving with a tension bar 
(but eventually did have to move over to it in order to be competitive).  
That emphasis on driver experience to designing and coming up with new alterations to things (within 
the specifications and rules of DIRT) is something I’ve heard of from other drivers about Bicknell: is that 
when you go there for a part or meet and talk with them, it’s dealing with other drivers and people who 
have first-hand experience and knowledge about racing, rather than just another sales person that may 
have general automotive knowledge.  
Peter then shifted to talking about his racing career: as he is 66 now, he estimates that he’s been racing 
for at least 47 years now, starting out in the late model class and then moving into the modifieds. Peter 
talked a bit about the challenge and strange position sometimes that he finds himself in, as he’s racing 
and competing against customers of his too. Peter talked about how the border closure has impacted 
them, and noted that 2020 was the first year that he had not raced at Ransomville weekly, since he 
started racing there 47 years ago: that it was always Friday Night (Ransomville), Saturday (Merritville), 
and Sunday (Humberstone). Merritville and Humberstone are both in Southern Ontario.  
Peter spoke about the importance of knowing track conditions, and that a phrase you’ll hear driver’s 
often say is they’re “chasing the track”: that you are setting up your car based on how you anticipate the 
track conditions to be, as dirt track conditions are constantly changing. Peter closed out the interview by 
talking about the importance of family, and that familial feeling of community that you find in dirt track 
racing, especially racing as long as he has: of making friends on either side of the border and staying up 
to date with folks.  
Post Interview 
After the interview, Peter and I chatted for a bit more while the interview finished uploading, and once 
it did I thanked Peter for taking the time out to do the interview – despite his busy schedule with that 
major move and remodeling – and told Peter to keep an eye out on his spam folder for a copy of the 
interview and the release form to sign.
