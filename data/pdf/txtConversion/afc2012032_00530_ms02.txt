Ruth Lipow, a familiar figure on the Olympia activist scene since 1989, turned 90-years old on 
the Winter Solstice. Born and educated in Hollywood, California, she experienced exciting, 
revolutionary times in American history. Last October 15, in a speech for the “Jobs, Not Cuts” 
and “Occupy Olympia” rallies in Sylvester Park, she said she hoped her memories would be 
useful today; they are. 
At age 10, Ruth was impressed by those who joined the The Lincoln Brigade to fight fascism in 
Spain. Early on, she witnessed her father’s fight to protect disability rights and bonuses for 
returned World War I veterans. Later, she saw the cruel treatment given WWII vets who camped 
across from the White House, demanding benefits promised them after their military service. 
“Instead of getting help, they were oppressed and abused by MacArthur, who broke up the 
encampment. This precedent continues among military vets today,” Ruth observed. 
By age 16, Ruth was active in the California gubernatorial campaign of writer Upton Sinclair, 
whose major platform was called EPiC – Ending Poverty in California. She studied theatre, 
earning a scholarship to work with Vladimir Sokoloff, famed director of the Moscow Art 
Theatre. She was a member of The American Student Union, and “that’s where I learned to stand 
up against injustice,” she says. 
The massive unemployment of the Depression lead to powerful union movements and strikes by 
groups such as the C.I.O., resulting in great advances for workers and the creation of the New 
Deal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
“The New Deal pushed down the country’s unemployment from 25% to 9%,” Ruth recalls, “and 
gave birth to needed public programs like the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the 
Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and Social Security! The National Youth Administration 
(NYA) helped unemployed youth, and from it, I received a small living wage and job skills.” 
“New Deal programs gave us roads, parks, schools, libraries, city halls, and many public 
buildings. Social Security was initiated, lifting millions of seniors out of poverty!,” Ruth 
emphasized. “FDR supported the right to organize labor unions. The WPA funded the arts, 
theatre, filmmakers, musician, historians, actors, directors and artists, making possible the 
careers of Orson Welles and John Houseman, among others.” 
As a result of some film work, Ruth met her first husband, William Alland, right-hand-man to 
the young Orson Welles. The couple moved to New York City to work with Welles and 
Houseman during the exciting time when the two established and ran the groundbreaking 
Mercury Theatre and Mercury Theatre Radio. 
The New Deal ended with World War II, and Ruth became a union worker. During the war, she 
was fired from Bendix Radio for organizing. “Over fifty years ago, I was a shop steward in the 
International Longshoreman and Warehouse Union, a strong union. With strong unions, wages 
were raised for millions of workers, creating a demand that helped produce the highest growth 
rates of the 20th century. A local of that same ILWU in Longview has been replaced by a 
company union and they need our support.” 
“Only 7% of today’s private industries have unions,” Ruth says, “while collective bargaining for 
public employees is under attack. Safety nets are being cut from under teachers, state workers, 
the disabled, the mentally ill, single mothers with children, people on Medicaid, and the 
unemployed. There is contempt for the unemployed today in this society.” 
Ruth’s marriage to Alland ended when, upon their return to Hollywood, he denounced her as 
communist to Joseph McCarthy’s House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC). Her union 
work and Hollywood scare tactics had made him nervous.“They had bigger people to go after, so 
they left me alone,” Ruth remembers. 
Her next marriage was to unionist Shay Lipow, regularly harassed by the FBI. Together they 
weathered the McCarthy era in Hollywood, when hundreds were fired or imprisoned under 
suspicion of being communists. They themselves were ostracized. Eventually, Shay’s work 
brought them to Olympia in 1989, where they were later joined by their son, Gar. 
Ruth has been busy ever since. She does reader’s theatre and is involved with the Senior Center, 
singing with its “Forever Young” rock and roll group – their oldest member. “My favorite song,” 
Ruth laughs, “is I Want to be Sedated!” 
Part of The Olympia Fellowship of Reconciliation, she’s in solidarity with Occupy Olympia. 
“It’s important! I want seniors to support it,” she says. “I believe in democracy from the ground 
up! I am disappointed in the growing militarism in this country. Bring the war billions home! I’m 
a good rank-and-file worker, and I have hung in there. Change comes from a powerful people’s 
movement that starts at the bottom. 
“I’ve been an activist for 70 years and I haven’t given up hope for a better world as long as we 
see movements like Occupy Wall Street, the recent demonstrations in Wisconsin, and committed 
people like you. 
“Let’s stay positive in the face of challenges so we keep our courage.” 
It’s clear that – no matter what her favorite song – for Ruth, sedation is out of the question!
