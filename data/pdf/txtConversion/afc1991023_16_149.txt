This 
is the beginning of another new phase. 
Yesterday's meeting was with the staff of the G-New Lisbon; 27GT 
Developmental Center as follows: 
Mr. Richard Cesta, Superintendent, 726-1000 
Mark Sepulveda, housekeeping 
Dr. Robert Jaslow, health services 
(available for emergency care - Other care will be from 
Burlington County Hospital 
in Mount Holly) 
Pete Finnegan, business manager 
Dr. Don Fitzgerald, personnel 
Dave Bowman, professional-residential services 
George Langdon, Assistant Superintendant 
(to be called in rase of any 
issues arising to be dealt 
with) 
Ed Roncaroney, food services 
meal times are set: 7:00 - 7:30, 
12:30- 1:00, 5:00- 5:15 
History of the institution: 
There are now 1200 employees and 778 residents. This is down 
from 1200+ residents and 600+ staff. Seventeen cottages have been 
renovated and a 60 bed extended care facility attached to the 
hospital unit. They have air conditioning for the first time and 
there are now 5 dietitians where there used to be none. There is 
now a nurse in every cottage and 6-8 speech therapists. 
"Change 
is always difficult" R.Cesta 
They began 
in 
1914 and became a state facility in 
1916, and they 
have been co-ed since April.

This will continue the notes of the previous day. Mr. 
Cesta had some interesting concerns. He 
made it clear that there 
was some concern on the part of the staff that since we were from 
Washington, we might be representatives of the FBI or CIA. I was 
curious that this was the nature of the assessment, rather than 
concern that we were from the Health and Hospitals Corp or the 
Pinelands Commission. I am guessing that there are other issues 
to be dealt with there, that involve some serious concerns of the 
staff. Once again I think that the issue of self—identification 
is 
of major significance. Also 
it 
is 
important that we not 
identify our residence as G—New Lisbon; 21GT, for fear that there 
will 
be those who may connect us more directly with the Pinelands 
Commission. 
After the meeting I spoke with Mr. Cesta about the 
allegations of feeble—mindedness in the local Piney population a 
la Elizabeth Kite's report. I asked whether there were any 
breakdowns regarding the residence patterns of clients. He 
indicated that while he was sure that they had figures, 
it did 
not seem that there were a disproportionate number of Pineys 
represented in the institution's population, but that also the 
issues were made more complex by the attempts to retain locals 
in 
the community, thereby enabling visiting from relatives and 
friends, biasing the population figures. Further, the 
issues of 
too little staff and inadequate facilities to permit the 
distribution of the residential population to 
local 
institutions 
places an 
increased burden on the state run institutions like 
this one, 
to take people from other places, when they can not 
find placements in their own areas, thereby making the population 
figures somewhat confusing. 
TX02: Re. John Sinton, 
Stockton State College 
John described the patterns of 
landscape throughout the 
Pinelands area, using the term mosaic to describe the patchwork 
of 
land. 
He noted further that 
the coastal area was settled as 
early as any except Virginia and New England. He noted the 
existence of a gazeteer, by Rose and Wolman(?) or Wolman and 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 2 
Rose(?), which describes the 19th cen 
like Port Norris and Port Elizabeth, 
17th century. There was even settleme 
basin, as an example, the Clarks' gra 
There are a series of old names such 
Parker. He maintains that the old pat 
change began to occur when the railro 
section from the southern section lea

tury town plans of places 
which were settled

as Cranmer, Sooy, Eslow and 
terns still exist, but that 
ad cut 
off the northern 
ding to the consequent 
ses 
in the south, but the 
orth. 
He noted that salt hay 
is still being cut by the Coxes and 
the Campbells, but that when they are done, there will 
be no one 
left who knows how to turf out the marshes. He said that there 
are many who say that the marshes look terrible, but that he has 
had a hard time determining what they are supposed to 
look like. 
He noted too that there 
is someone who might be contacted, 
Albert Reeves, a "pusher" on the Manumuskin, who pushes the boat 
when they go out for sora rail. He noted that the difference 
between the sora rail and the clapper rail 
is that the clapper 
rail feed in brackish water, while the soras feed 
in fresh water 
He also talked about the 
"mud wallopers" who ride their pick—up 
trucks into big mud holes 
in 
the abandoned clay pits, to 
determine who can get the furthest without getting stuck. He also 
noted the three boats indigenous to the area, the sneakbox, 
garvey and the seabright skiff or railbird. 
Finally, he went over John Berger's report noting good 
resource people , such as Eph Tomlinson, mayor of Medford, and a 
man who 
will be useful 
in helping to avoid 
trouble, De Koos, 
president of the lake associations, Giberson, Ed Wullermin, of 
Hammonton, etc. Incidentally the man Berger refers to 
in the book 
is 
not Charles, but John Kroekus. 
TX03: 
It was odd driving back to the forest last night, 
in the 
mist after the rain. The air was so thick it was hard to see the 
yellow lines at times, and approaching cars came at me 
like 
distant animals. It was almost impossible to tell 
the reflectors 
on the mailboxes and reflections in the discarded tin cans from 
the eyes of animals on the side of the road. Jean and Bill had 
warned me about driving slowly because of the deer. 
But curiously I felt at home at last. 
It's all been a 
slightly unreal return to the woods, to my new—found home. I feel 
more and more like the cultural hybrid I have become in 
the past 
three years in the Pine Barrens, comfortable both 
in the city and 
in 
the woods, but satisfied in neither place. The shifting back 
and forth and the lack of a home is clearly taking a toll 
on my 
psychic resources and energy, but in some ways it may be that I 
have 
in fact chosen to be attached completely to neither place, 
that the freedom and choices provided by two environments somehow 
satisfies needs of which I am only partially conscious. 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 3 
Now that I am preparing to return 
to New York for the 
coming week,it is almost as though I am drinking in the green 
space, filling myself with the sights, sounds and smells outside 
the windows, 
like someone gorging before beginning a fast. My 
mind 
is 
racing to the pine bough outside the kitchen window, and 
to the leaves outside the window at which I am typing. My mind 
keeps running back to the slender shadow that 
jumped across the 
road last night in the headlights of the car, a young deer, by 
its size. I suspect that I will gorge also on my New Yorkness 
before I return, on Thai 
and Japanese food, movies and book 
stores, and the easy sense of patterns familiar from childhood. 
TX04: Trying to catch up... 
I left the project headquarters in the park on 9/16/83 to do 
my first phase of project visiting. I headed for Steve Soviczki's 
in G—Atsion; 22GT, but he wasn't home. I was greeted by Avon, the 
goat, who followed me around, while I took pictures of the porch, 
the compost mound, the vegetable garden and the relationship 
between the two houses,the old one and the one he 
is building 
behind it 
in 
the same style.

TXO1: I am back 
in the Pines at last after a hectic two weeks in 
New York, teaching and catching up with friends. It felt good to 
find myself back in the Pines again although the drive felt much 
longer than in the past. Maybe 
it gets longer, the longer I stay 
away. 
It was nice to see Sullivan too, romping through the woods 
when I took a walk with Sue. He really feels more at home here, 
and 
in many ways I do too. There's an almost symbiotic 
relationship between him and the woods, and 
it sometimes seems as 
though his nose becomes part of the ground and as though he 
is 
an 
organic part of 
its 
life and 
its growth force. 
I stopped at the pizza place G—Four Mile; 27GT across the road 
from the project office on the way down, and there was a hunter 
there with a bow and arrow permit attached to the back of his 
camouflage suit. I guess there won't be as many deer leaping out 
from the sides of the roads on this visit. 
TX02_: 
There are a few details left over from the last visit, 
that I didn't have to time to note 
in my field notes. 
Steve Soviczki G—Atsion; 22GT told me that his father is 
in 
the maintenance department of the Lebanon State School. Curiously 
that's the first time that he's mentioned his dad. Also, after 
all 
the fear that he expressed about his trip to Ireland, 
it 
appears that he's fallen 
in 
love with 
it and now is contemplating 
moving there when he retires. We went to a party at a friend's 
house that night and 
it turned out that there was someone there 
who was interested in selling some property in a town 
in the 
northwest of Ireland, but Steve is really interested 
in having 
something in the country. 
We are planning a trip to Louie's tonight. Mal 
is 
interested 
in getting 
in with some hunters and I said that there might be 
some possibilities there. More likely though, they will 
be mostly 
trappers. I will be curious to see how much things have changed 
since the advent of the new owner. He supposedly has replaced the 
old shot—up sign, and has changed the menu a bit.

TXO1: Today was the day of the Pinelands Commission hearing. I 
went to the Southampton township municipal building with Carl 
Fleischhauer, to listen to the certification votes on G-Hamilton; 
10G1 township, G-Stafford; 56GT township (56), and Ocean County. 
Commissioners present were as follows: Tom Darlington, 
Candace Ashmun, Joan Batory, Chuck Newcomb, James Hyres, John 
Vaughan, Steve Lee, Jim Coleman, Frank Parker, Terry Moore, Bob 
Shinn, and John Sinton. The minutes were reviewed and there was 
discussion of a `520,000 grant from the Geraldine Dodge Foundation 
for the education program. Terry Moore, the executive director 
noted that there are going to be signs on the Garden State 
Parkway welcoming people to the Pinelands National Reserve. This 
I imagine 
is a response to Emily Russell's comments about the 
lack of any notation for "passers-through", of their presence in 
the Pinelands National Reserve. 
Once again it makes the area 
more visible, and therefore available to the "outsiders." I 
wonder how long the "insiders" will allow the signs to remain. I 
would imagine that they will have some value as targets! Once 
again this may illustrate the conflict between insiders and 
outsiders. I still think that the renaming of roads with route 
numbers violates the historical and cultural significance of the 
names that are locally used i.e. 
the Weekstown/Pleasant Mills 
Road or Four Mile Circle. 
There are three remaining lectures 
in the Commission's 
Resource Series: on October 9, Allan Mounier, October 16, Mary 
Hufford, and on 10/23, Dick Regensburg. Terry noted that last 
year there were 100 people present. 
I wonder who those people 
were and what their interests were. 
TX02: There was discussion re a "Rucks(?)" septic system which 
has been developed by a Professor Lack from Connecticut, and 
there has been a proposal to test 100 systems in the Pinelands 
for nitrate levels. Apparently one advantage 
is that the inside 
fixtures are standard but the changes are to the outside 
filtration system. They suggested that it could potentially 
replace the current systems. It is two to three thousand dollars 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 6 
more than the standard systems but less expensive than the 
Wisconsin mound system and less or equivalent to the waterless 
toilets currently available. Also the field requirements should 
be 
less. Department of Environmental Protection will 
issue the 
permits and the Pinelands Commission will monitor through the 
work of Dr. Jaworski. 
TX03: Public comment (other than the certification issues): 
Jack Tagart: Past president of the Jersey Shore Audubon 
Society (whose membership comes predominantly from Ocean County), 
and a member of the Pine Barrens Coalition: He read from a report 
issued by Rutgers, written by B. Budd Chavooshian, 
in which he 
says that the 
land 
is 
our most precious natural resource, but 
until very recently, 
land use policies have insensitively 
squandered the land. An environment has been created which 
is not 
worthy of man's intelligence. (Paper is entitled "Transfer of 
Development Rights: A New Concept in Land Use Management: A New 
Concept in Land Use Management.") Tagart said, he was commenting, 
"to reinforce any feelings you might have and to 
let you know 
that the people of Ocean County agree with you on your stand on 
Ocean County." 
The next discussion dealt with the five current 
Administrative Law Judge 
rulings: 
TX04: The first concerned an 11,000 + acre lot in G—Buena Vista; 
03GT, owned by a Mr. Sheehan. It 
is apparently an undersized lot, 
and the owner is seeking a waiver of strict compliance, which was 
denied by the ALJ contending that there was enough land available 
for the owner to buy parcels which would provide the appropriate 
sized lot. The decision of the ALJ was unanimously adopted. 
TX05: The next issue concerned three combined cases in G—Egg 
Harbor; 05GT Township 
concerning Pinelands approvals and what is 
the impact of the approvals. Apparently the Judge ruled 
in favor 
of the Pinelands Commission staff. 
The discussion which followed concerned the question of 
whether the townships were in fact being punished for their 
refusal to come into conformance, by the attempts of the 
Pinelands Commission to force them to accept particular 
facilities and proposals. As 
if to confirm the concerns of 
Commissioner Sinton, the Pinelands Commission's lawyer stated 
that he felt that Egg Harbor Township held the keys to the 
dilemma. They could come into conformance, he said, and seek to 
modify the Comprehensive Management Plan. Referring to Egg Harbor 
Township, he said, "their ordinances don't mean anything at this 
point." 
In response Commissioner Sinton said, "you have a choice 
of getting hung or getting shot, and then it 
is a question of 
what kind of gun and what kind of bullet." 
All 
voted to support the ALJ decision except for Hyres and 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 7 
Sinton who voted against. 
TX06: The next group of people to speak came from G—Woodland; 27GT 
Townshi p 
George ? (township committee official): 
We need your help, 
and we cooperated on the basis of your help on the 
in—lieu of 
tax payments bill 
and the vacant lands bill. Both are stalled in 
Trenton, and there 
is an unfair burden placed on the township 
because of the Pinelands. We understand that it can now be 
undone, but now we need your help. Burden placed on Woodland 
Township residents is unfair. We urge your cooperation in this 
effort to remedy this situation. Taxes have doubled and 
it 
is 
particularly unfair to senior citizens. A young man like myself 
has some potential to make more money, but they don't. Most of 
the people would agree with the concepts and back the Pinelands 
Commission, but we need some kind of help. 
Bob De Petrus: S 1791 
is a carrot. The tax increases might 
not sound like that much to some of you, but we have no services. 
We disbanded the police department. We reduced the tax assessors 
and administrative services and there's no where else to cut. If 
CD money wasn't available, we'd have to close the dump. We gave 
back the Green Acres money for a park because we don't have any 
money to match anything. With the land devaluation 
there 
is 
less 
income coming from taxes. 
Terry Moore: We feel that the bill 
is stalled not on the 
merits of the bill 
itself, but because of the time of year. We 
can not expect action until they come back after election. 
Woodland township has had a history of yelling across a few 
thousand acres at each other, but there's a new cooperative 
attitude now with local officials. 
The Commission passed a resolution 
to convey to Senator 
Weiss their desire to move as quickly as possible 
in view of the 
criticalness of the impact on the townships in the preservation 
area of S1791. Adopted unanimously.

TX01: What constitutes a memory scape? 
The ability to know that a place 
is there without having to 
go and see 
it. Simply the knowledge that it 
is there, and the 
series of 
images themselves make a landscape live 
in the mind. 
I am frustrated by an apparent inability to get my friends 
to sit with me and to do cognitive maps and their refusals to 
take me out on the roads. I understand their scheduling 
difficulties and that just because I am ready to have them take 
me out doesn't mean that they have nothing else to do . I know 
that there are valid reasons that they can not go out with me, 
but it makes me feel concerned given the limited time I have 
in 
which to do this project. 
It 
is also possible then, that some of the hesitation in 
taking me to these places 
is founded in the fear that the reality 
will not meet the memory, or the belief (conscious or 
unconscious) that memory 
is always better than the reality a la 
Jan Yoors book on the Gypsies. Also there may be hesitation 
because the actual 
image has become 
in fact more real 
than the 
place itself. Therefore the return to the place 
is superfluous as 
long as the image remains. 
Can a memory scape be constituted of images of places that 
do not exist/have never existed? 
Does a "psychic homeland" constitute an example of an 
image 
or memory scape that has no foundation in actual experience? If 
so from what does 
it come and what purpose does 
it serve? Can one 
person convey their memory scape to another? And can their memory 
scape be adopted as 
in 
the case of a child that has heard his or 
her parent express a longing or attachment for a particular place 
and incorporates that sense into their own cognitive image or 
memory scape? Can there be a future counterpart to the memory 
scape, a futurescape? Is that the psychic homeland?

TX01: Re. the completion of the 
notes regarding Steve Sovisczki: 
On October 10, 
1983, Elaine and I left to meet Steve Sovisczky at 
his home in G-Atsion; 22GT. He greeted us outside, and after 
introducing Elaine and Steve and Avon, the goat, and Blackie, the 
very skinny dog that had come visiting from the local bar, we 
piled into my car for the ride. While the tape logs will describe 
the encounter in some more detail, and I will 
return to complete 
the field notes on Steve's maps after I have that set of tapes 
logged, I will sketch the day's events here 
in a somewhat 
superficial manner. We began by backtracking from 
Steve's house 
to Atco/Atsion road along the north side of the lake. We followed 
that road to the cross roads, with Steve narrating the history of 
the area, while Elaine ran the tapes, 
and I jumped out 
periodically to take pictures. He described his father's family 
as Russian, having left during the Revolution and his mother's 
family as descended from Hessian deserters. He is extremely 
knowledgeable about the area, having joined the 
local historical 
society which seems quite active as 
indicated by multiple signs 
in the Tabernacle/Indian Mills area, noting historic places and 
the settings of 
local events. This community is perhaps the most 
"self-conscious" of any I have seen, with respect to 
its history 
Steve narrated the names of various intersections and described 
the now unseen places, 
like taverns and schools, and his own 
personal places like the home of his grandfather, with great 
affection, making them appear almost visible as he described the 
invisible history through which we were passing. 
While most of the rest of the account will await the tape 
log, 
as we reached the Pic-a-Lilli tavern on G-Route 206; 22GT 23GT. 
Steve invited us to stop for lunch. Having covered as much of the 
recording equipment as possible, we entered to find a dimly lit 
bar with a package store to the left and a restaurant to the 
right in fairly typical fashion. I remember my surprise when I 
first arrived in south Jersey three years ago, to find that the 
liquor stores nearly always seemed to have bars as well and often 
hid restaurants which would have been unexpected by the naive 
observer. It 
is a tradition similar to that of the pubs 
in 
Ireland, as I remember them. We sat down toward the back of the 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 10 
restaurant after a pro forma interaction with the bartender, and a 
once over from the customers. We ordered lunch: chili for me, a 
hamburger for Elaine, and a thick roast beef sandwich for Steve. 
The chili was wonderfully meaty and quite spicy compared to most 
I have had 
in 
the Pine Barrens, 
a close competitor, possibly 
superior to Kubel's chili on Long Beach Island at the northern 
end near the light house. 
We talked about a variety of things including the mayor of 
one of the municipalities, my one—time housing in Sweetwater, and 
the Jersey Devil. Steve maintained that he believed that there 
could have been a malformed animal which appeared every so often 
and gave rise to new "sightings." This led to a discussion of 
"strange" occurences in the woods near his house including a 
story he told of a group of young kids who had gotten stuck 
in 
the sand road near his house one day. He said, that he didn't 
think much about it until, when he was wandering in th church 
graveyard near his house the next day, he found a mound of dirt 
and a sign saying he thought at first, "I killed a beer here" 
with a wooden cross. He later determined that in fact it said I 
killed a deer here, and then several days later 
he found the 
carcasss of another small animal and a pad near his house which 
he showed me which said something to the effect of "graveyard 
haunted. Stolen from church, one large cross." It was on a pad 
belonging to a company in North Jersey, which he then called and 
the person answering the phone angrily hung up after saying he 
wished that whoever this was would stop harassing him with these 
threatening calls, although this was the first and only call 
Steve had made. 
Steve told another story about the man who had once lived 
in 
the house, and who had seen several men get out of a car one day 
with guns. Thinking it was too early for the hunting season, he 
became suspicious and wrote down the license number on the house 
itself. Several days later, the bodies of a wealthy cranberry 
grower and his assistant were found on a trail 
in the woods, and 
the 
license number led to the capture of the men. Although he has 
repainted the house he has left the rectangle with the license 
number unpainted and visible as a sign of the history he lives 
with.

TXO1: I returned to the field today after a long week 
in New 
York, and spent the early part of the afternoon catching up with 
friends that I will contact for their cognitive maps. After a few 
hours setting up appointments with folks and catching up with the 
other fieldworkers, I left to pick up the maps that I had left 
with Steve Sovisczki but he was not at home. I went on toward the 
Morrisses house and stopped to take pictures of the logging 
operation along the north side of the Waterford road (Route 536?) 
also known as G—Chew Road; 32GT, I believe. I spoke at some length 
to the son of the owner, Frank Rusnak (561-4567), about the 
operation itself, and about their history in the area. The family 
originally came from Czechoslovakia and settled first in Jersey 
City, then moved here and bought about 150 acres for $1000. 1 
asked what had brought them here 
in the first place and he began 
to tell me about the history of the region, and that the road had 
once been part of the stage route between Cherry 
Hill 
and 
Forked River and that there was once a hotel which housed the 
travellers en route and allowed the driver to change for a fresh 
team of horses. The area he emphasized, had once been very much 
more developed, sited as 
it was on the stage route, but that that 
had changed in the last few years. The hotel burned in the 
1930's, and the community had become less significant as cars 
drove on through (instead of the stage.) He pointed to the road 
that ran perpendicular to the "yard" and said that the area still 
had a lot of the old foundations of homes, back 
in the woods 
about a mile or so, but now there wasn't much left. 
The family had since accumulated 250 acres or so, parts of 
which were farmed at one time, but now they don't use the land 
for active timbering or agriculture. His grandparents had cleared 
all 
the land themselves and built a house and lived in a "chicken 
coop" until they were able to build a better house. The whole 
family lives 
in the area, with his uncle's house being just east 
of the "yard" and his own house across the street. 
They bid on timber to be cut for the State and then sell the 
split cords for $85 and the unsplit cords for $65. People tend to 
come back year after year, but there are newcomers, and there are 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 12 
those that come from far away like Jersey City and Cherry Hill 
to 
buy the wood and then resell 
it at a profit. He talked about a 
couple of guys who came down with a dump truck and then bagged 
three pieces and sold them for five dollars to the city people. 
He 
is going to graduate from Glassboro in December in 
Criminal Justice and then he would like to become a parole 
officer, "but my dad said that if I don't like it, I can come 
back here. 
I've been doin' this since I was 
in second grade."

TX01: There are a few things that I need to outline as soon as 
possible. 
1) The mid-term meeting today at the Pinelands Commission's 
headquarters. 
2) My conversations with Steve Soviczki. 
3) My conversation with the Toussaints. 
4) The remainder of the Pinelands Commission hearing notes. 
5) 
Issues of doing field work and ethics (Subtitle: The outsider 
looking at the insiders looking in at the real 
insiders: or how I 
learned to 
love folklore, or the observer observing the observed 
observing the observers observing them.) 
6) Memory stapes and how to analyse them. 
7) Memory scapes as mediators of change and continuity. 
8) And there must be many others I am too tired to remember!!!! 
TX02: Several things came from today's mid-term meeting that 
were deserving of note. 
Elaine described the sense of place 
in the past versus life 
today as significant, and I certainly consider these issues of 
considerable importance in the context of my own work. She 
is 
interested 
in yardart and would be happy to show me yards 
in 
the 
area with interesting stuff 
in them. She described yard scapes 
and yard art as 
indicators of 
individual 
identity and as symbols 
of community values as well, and noted her interest in gender 
roles 
in 
institutions like gun clubs and fire houses. 
Jens' presentation included a discussion of the local 
conservation officer, Hershel Beebe who commented that he had been 
"painted up" all over the area, and that that implied graffiti 
all 
along the road, suggesting that he should quit, 
leave and 
expletive delete himself. In a wonderful Jens-ism, he noted that 
the scale of the images was too great to effectively photograph, 
and that therefore there had been "censorship by geography or 
topography!" His contacts have included politicians, fire wardens 
and the parish priest, as well 
as the tax collector and his wife, 
the Mitchells in Estell Manor. He described a subculture of bingo 
players in Heislerville and Woodbine as an economic basket case 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 14 
whose population has decreased from a large number of Puerto 
Ricans to a group of about 40 families, with high drug use and 
crime rates. There has also been a decline of the Polish and 
Italian families in the area. Conspicuously absent given the 
nature of his informant, the parish priest, was any discussion of 
the changing character of the Jewish population. He described 
sand mining in Dorchester, farming in Corbin City, the hunting of 
small game and his encounters with a cedar saw mill operator 
named George Brewer who supplies wood to the oyster boats and for 
planking in the Port Norris area. He would seem to be a good 
contact in terms of the place names he provided for areas that he 
feels are generally unused by others, and that therefore his 
rather advanced cognitive map 
is uniquely interesting. He cited 
names like Dead Ostrich Bog, A Horse Hung Himself, and Laurel 
City (named for the large number of 
laurel bushes). He noted that 
oystering seems to occur to the west and south of the area where 
the bay actually touches the Pinelands region, but that he would 
still try to contact .some of those who lived 
in the Pines even 
if 
they fished in non—Pines waters. One point was of particular 
significance. He noted that while baymen may self—identify as 
boat builders, they may not build boats on an ongoing or even 
frequent basis, but rather that they build a boat when they need 
one. He also spoke of a man named Lou Peterson, a bayman, 
crabber, clammer, and gill net fisherman.

TX01: Spent last night at the G-Warren Grove; 56GT Firehouse 
supper. Arrived at about 6:00 instead of earlier as I had hoped 
and found myself in the midst of a rather active setting-up 
scene. Jack Cervetto was taking $4.00 from each person as they 
entered and returning a ticket. The firehouse was nearly full, 
and the tables were already set up with the food, 
tons of food 
including ham, chicken, meatloaf, pasta with sauces, macaroni, 
green beans, peas, stuffed cabbage and red cabbage, cranberry 
sauce and much more.

I stopped in the kitchen and saw Jenny Holloway, Pearl 
Cervetto's s.ister, and Michael Smith, who told me that there was 
a place saved for me 
in the back room, by Bill Smith and John and 
Mary Budd. I walked back and greeted them, and found that they 
were sitting with several other people whose faces were familiar 
from the Friends of Warren Grove meetings I had gone to 
last 
year, but whose names have escaped me. They asked whether anyone 
else was coming and I told them that I expected two other 
fieldworkers to show up eventually, and Bill Smith said that two 
"suspiciously urban looking men, one with a beard," had just 
walked by. I ran outside and found that Mal 
and Tom had arrived. 
We went inside just about the time that they started calling 
tables to come up to the buffet tables in the front and back 
rooms. I ran around taking pictures of both rooms and the people 
standing on line while Mal and Tom talked to Bill Smith and Mary 
Ann Thompson respectively. I spoke with several other people 
including Lucille of Lucille's luncheonette (Route 539, Warren 
Grove and a group of people from Manahawkin, originally from 
Newark and Pennsylvania, who said that they came here instead of 
going to the spaghetti dinner in Manahawkin because you can get 
spaghetti anytime, but these are "country people and they know 
how to cook." There was something rather condescending 
and 
almost stereotypical about it. 
One of the women cornered me as I was about to leave the 
group and told me that the woman sitting to her left, was the 
owner of a restaurant on Bay Avenue across from the Shop Rite and 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 16 
that they had been badly hurt by the hurricane, which had twisted 
some hundred year old trees, and caused $2500 worth of damage to 
her new Pontiac. She continued about how the powder blue car had 
been repainted and that her friend had had 
it painted Navy blue 
and powder blue, and 
it was just "gorgeous" and then asked her 
friend where she had gotten the idea. 
It was an odd conversation 
considering the fact that it was a total non sequitur, and I had 
not been talking to her. I assume that it was a function of her 
curiousity about me as a photographer, and her desire to be 
included in a picture which she had by her location been excluded 
from. There are several shots of this group on one of the rolls 
of film. She then followed me back to the Smith's table and began 
talking to Olga, the woman who was doing the 50-50 raffle. 
I eventually got something to eat, which was consumed with 
ambivalence about all the shots I was missing, and so having 
wolfed down what was on my plate, I turned to get up to take more 
photographs, and realized that Jack Cervetto Jr. was sitting to 
my 
left with his wife Mary, who makes roller skating costumes and 
was written up 
in a recent issue of the Beacon newspaper. We had 
a long discussion about her business, and she told me that she 
had sold 70 skirts at a recent show they had gone to 
in the 
Poconos, and that her stock was so depleted that she couldn't 
even go out now, because she had nothing to sell. She 
is going to 
develop a line that will be 
in 
several basic colors, for those 
who want to order costumes, but that the majority of her orders 
come from personal contacts at the shows. I wonder whether roller 
skating 
is a faddish phenomenon, or part of the folklife we 
should be documenting.

TX01: Jack Cervetto and John Budd G-Warren Grove; 56GT and I went 
out on Friday morning (October 28, 1983) to take a ride 
in 
the 
woods. We met at Jack's house #, 
and then took John's Jeep over 
to the place where Jack keeps his 1941 vintage, war time, 
rebuilt, open top, open sides, and 
in some places open bottom M 
"vehicle." John and I arranged ourselves in the back, on top of a 
piece of foam rubber that Jack had supplied for the occasion, and 
Jack started 'er up.

We went first to his "islands," two places surrounded by 
"sloughs," low, wet places, that were particularly wet because of 
the recent rains. He pointed out the slough as we drove through 
it, 
acutely aware that my car would not manage this even with 
four-wheel drive. He drove us to a stream he described as the 
Plain Branch (known as Plains Branch in the gazeteer 
G-Bass 
River; 15GT) and noted that he was waiting for this to freeze over 
so he could cut off the cedar on the other side of 
the stream 
this winter. (While most of the following conversation will 
be 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 18 
described in the tape logs, I will quickly outline here the 
pattern of the day and the sections of 
it that were not taped.) 
We continued on to another of the areas 
in which he cuts or 
leases the right to cut off the wood, 
and while I did see a 
path, the height and unbroken quality of the 
low bush huckleberry 
growth, made 
it appear that no one had been here for quite a long 
time. Jack said however, that 
he had been there just the day 
before. 
We eventually found ourselves beside a high ridge of 
land 
that he described as a man made dam, constructed by the previous 
owner in the early 1900's in contemplation of turning the 
adjoining swamp land 
into cranberry bogs. It was still possible 
to see large numbers of cedar stumps in the ground where he had 
clear cut the 
land nearly 75 years before. I thought of the New 
York entrepreneurs that would take these stumps, and turn them 
into Park Avenue coffee tables for hundreds of dollars. We walked 
to the sluice gates, which were still 
intact although in need of 
repair and new planks to change the water level, and we passed an 
old bridge which looked like 
it would fall 
into the river below 
at any minute. Jack said that there were several people who liked 
to come here to fish for pike and that he kept the roads narrow 
and the bridge impassable to keep "every Tom, Dick and Harry" 
from driving through here. As 
it was, people would back 
in part 
way and walk the rest of the distance to the sluice gates, 
passing huckleberry bushes, and sheep laurel, 
indigo berry and 
briar, and the fresh prints of deer, as we had. Jack described 
the course of the fire that had ravished the land 
in 
1906, and 
that had 
left the owner bankrupt, as a result of charge of 
negligence filed against him. 
We returned to the Jeep and wound our way back to the place 
where the Jeep was kept, passing the old sawmill buildings along 
Route 539, on the AT&T Co-Axial cable line, which Jack proudly 
noted that he had leased to them. There were the remains of the 
old mill house with equipment still stored in 
it, 
and the charred 
remainders of the "slave cabins" which housed the workers. John's 
observation that there appeared to be an old crank-up Victrola in 
one of the structures began a conversation in which Jack noted 
that there had been a working one 
in there until had been stolen, 
by some of these "people from the cities," a not so veiled barb 
meant for me. He enjoys kidding me about my city roots, a pattern 
I take as part of a genuine liking; 
if 
he didn't like me, he 
couldn't kid me. 
He noted too that this had been the grounds of 
the 
last camp meeting in Warren Grove, and that as 
late as the 
thirties, there were horses and wagons lined up along the road to 
listen to the service of the preacher that came up from 
Tuckerton. 
We passed a pile of 
logs at that point, of different lengths 
and thicknesses, and he 
identified some as clamming territory 
markers, that is the thinnest poles with green tops, others as 
destined for fences, and others for lagoons 
in Mystic Islands. 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 19 
At that point we returned the Jeep to 
its "parking space" 
in 
the woods and took pictures at Jack's suggestion of me behind the 
wheel, as he further offered me the opportunity to "help him" 
in 
his work. He would cut the cedar down and I was to drag 
it out. 
It was not clear whether that was with or without the Jeep! 
We returned to John's Jeep for a ride to Lucille's 
luncheonette on the main street in Warren Grove. With special 
"attention" from Lucille, we sat at a table on the south wall, 
and ordered homemade soup, chili, a burger and tuna salad 
sandwich between us and while waiting for our lunches to be 
served, Jack introduced Doctor Rubinstein to a Mr. Sheehan from 
the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) in town, who was seated 
with another man whose name I did not catch. Mr. Sheehan it 
turned out is responsible for maintaining the roads and fences of 
all 
their installations, including the three in Warren Grove and 
one 
in Ship Bottom that according to his conversation with John 
is badly 
in need of 
its new 7 foot chain link fence with barbed 
wire at the top at a forty five degree angle. (Isn't it amazing 
what sticks in one's mind?) 
There was much joking between all 
of us, about how long 
it 
was taking for the FAA men to get their lunch of scrapple, and 
about an Environmental Psychologist being someone who gets 
buildings to 
lie on couches etc., and about John's suggestion 
"that if 1 wasn't careful he'd arrange an interview with Irene, 
the neighbor who was a nurse 
in Hitler's army! "Lucille asked me 
if I was getting "educated" 
in the woods, and congratulated me on 
my doctorate asking 
if that meant I was going to be called 
Professor. She also suggested jokingly that when I "finished with 
the men," I should return to 
get the real story on Warren Grove! 
TX02: We 
left to return to Jack's house to pick up Pearl and then 
set off on the Red Road G-Woodland; 27GT G-Bass River; 15GT 
G-Washington; 26GT to see the house that belonged to an architect 
who had bought the land from Jack to build an extraordinary 
house. It was on a lake, reclaimed from a cranberry bog, and 
hidden in the woods off the road, where it would be unlikely that 
anyone other than a hunter who knew his way around, would find 
it. 
I 
TX03: We next drove to see the last Indian camp site 
in 
the area, 
G-Woodland; 27GT a clearing of pine trees and thin brush where the 
ground cover was composed of some low bush huckleberry, sweet 
fern ("Woodjin's enemy," a term Jack used because it gathers sand 
ticks 
in the summer and 
if you brush against it, 
you get the 
ticks. It 
is also supposed to be rather vile smelling.), 
and a 
few other species including one small clump of "Indian pipe," a 
white, 
low growing stem which looks like a horse's head 
about 
two to three inches from the ground. We found a bare area where 
Jack thinks they had their camp fires, and he says it was burned 
so much that nothing will grow there now, and a place where there 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 20 
were about ten to fifteen clam shells (and hints of others) 
scattered on the ground, looking as though they might have been 
left there yesterday, instead of 120 years ago as Jack estimated. 
(He mentioned that Clarence Cranmer grandfather would talk about 
them passing the house in the morning on the way to fish and 
clam.)The bleached white color was the only thing to 
indicate 
their potential age. We explored for a while and then continued 
along Red Road, or Stevenson Road to Papoose Branch G—Washington 
Township; 26GT where we watched the beginning of some berry 
harvesting. There were several boxes of bee hives at the edge of 
the road and 
it was not long before the bees entered the car. At 
the other end of the bog two men worked a conveyor belt like 
harvester, while one scooped/pushed the berries, the other aided 
them in passing up the diagonal ramp of the conveyor belt. It 
was certainly a lot different than the back—breaking job of 
harvesting that pickers must do and the leisure time gathering I 
had done with two friends last year 
in the same spot. Pearl said 
that that was where they get their berries and that they were 
beautiful this year. I was surprised to see that only the one 
(north?) bog was flooded and that the other remained dry, and I 
wonder whether last night's frost damaged the exposed vines. 
TX04: We passed the Papoose Branch Stream G—Washington; 26GT and 
Jack noted the force with which the water seemed to be moving 
through there, but I must admit that all I noticed was the sound 
of the water, which was lovely and musical after a day listening 
to the motor of two jeeps. Jack noted that it was still possible 
to drink from this stream, and I remember having heard that it 
had fertility aiding properties. Jack also said a few weeks ago 
that he always kept a cup there, but that somebody had taken 
it 
recently. 
TX05: We continued on to G—Bear Swamp Hill; 26GT from there, and I 
had a long awaited chance to see again a view that has stayed 
with me from the early days of my 
life 
in the Pine Barrens. It 
was as spectacular as I'd remembered, and it was wonderful to be 
there with people I really liked. Pearl said she'd like to have a 
house there, but that she would be afraid. I assumed that she 
meant she would be afraid of the people, but she said no, not too 
many people come there at this time of year, but that it was the 
snakes she feared. As we 
left Bear Swamp Hill, after Jack told us 
that there had been an airplane crash that had sheared off the 
existing fire tower, which has not been replaced. (Jack asked me 
if 
the Lebanon State Forest tower is an official one, since it's 
not on the fire service's maps, but I didn't have an answer.) 
TX06: We returned toward G—Warren Grove; 56GT (I think) and Jack 
took us to a boggy area, where someone had cut leaving large 
excellent pieces scattered on the ground. (I have since heard 
that the people cutting on the land were run out 
because of the 
lousy job they had done before.) But in the process Jack showed 
me the area where he used to gather moss, and described raking 
the moss up from a a wet area like a bog, with an 
instrument with 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 21 
7 or 8 inch tines to pick 
it up. 
It was then laid up on the 
"hassock" of the cedar tree, (This 
is 
an area of higher ground 
thrown up at the base of 
a cedar tree.) where it remained until 
it had dried out some, making it easier to carry. 
If 
it was left 
out on a humid night according to Jack, 
it can absorb 15 pounds 
of water just from the air! The pieces are then collected and 
brought home, where they are allowed to dry still further, before 
they are either tied to a board for the grave blankets of the 
area, or bagged and sent to a nursery. Our visit to the spot 
where he used to moss, showed me the difference between what I 
had assumed was sphagnum moss, which he described as sheet moss 
and the real thing which grows 
in wet boggy areas. He described 
its smell 
as sort of 
iodine—y and that it seemed to have a lot of 
iodine, and both he and Pearl told me that it had good 
disinfecting qualities. 
We also went to Duck Hollow where we curiously saw no ducks, 
just as 
in the breeding ground near where Jack had told me that 
they return each year. 
Shortly after that we returned to our "home base," all 
generally agreed that it was time to 
put our feet up and have a 
drink.

TX01: The last few days have been rather hectic but wonderful. I 
have spent many hours with the Warren Grovers 
G—Warren Grove; 
56GT, first yesterday with Jack and Pearl Cervetto and John Budd 
and then today at the Old Stone Store with Jack, Pearl and John, 
Alden Cranmer and Ed Hazleton of Manahawkin 
Last night at the 
Pic—a—lilli bar and restaurant, Route 206 G—Atsion; 22GT, I bumped 
into Steve Soviczki G—Shamong; 22GT who introduced me to a friend, 
Sam Lemmon (?), the great grandson of Sammy Giberson, the fiddler 
who 
is said to have stumped the Jersey Devil with his fiddling. 
I am truly feeling warmly welcome, as Jack continues to 
introduce me to everyone as Doctor Nora or Doctor Rubinstein, 
apparently taking great pride 
in the label. 
The label has stuck 
as Ed Hazleton has taken to calling me "Doc." (I was embarrassed 
when Ed asked what kind of a doctor I was 
and Alden Cranmer 
guessed a psychologist! I asked how he knew and he said I looked 
like one!) (Also it appears that Ed knew about the project from 
Dirk Van Ness, of the Conservation Foundation (?) who had asked 
him whether he'd be willing to talk to one of us some time.)I 
learned a lot today and yesterday and will continue to be 
frustrated by my inability to retain it all. I was very upset 
this morning at the thought that I might have lost all 
of 
yesterday's woods walk with Jack and Pearl because of the 
mechanical failure of the tape recorder, but now that I know that 
at least some of 
it 
is 
on tape I feel much better. Now to 
remember all 
of the last few hours... well 
at least as much as I 
can record until I have to leave for the Warren Grove Halloween 
party at the fire house, Route 539, Warren Grove. 
TX02: Ed G—Stafford; 56GT told a story about a clamming dog that 
belongs to someone he knows. It's a Labrador, and he says that it 
will dig up the clams with its paws, place them along the edge of 
the beach and when the heat of the sun warms them up enough to 
open, the dog returns to eat them. He swears that it's "the 
gospel truth." 
TX03: G—Stafford; 56GT He and Jack were talking about hunting and 
they said there aren't any fox hunters left 
in the area anymore, 
Rubinstein--83 Fieldnotes 
page 23 
nor coon hunters and they both noted that the coon population is 
quite large, Jack noting with glee that we almost stepped in a 
"coon pancake" yesterday at Bear Swamp Hill. 
Ed 
is a duck hunter and carves decoys and silhouettes in his 
retirement. He used to do construction work. He talked about the 
fact that there are some days when he just doesn't feel 
like 
carving but he goes out to the shop and 
in a few minutes he gets 
into 
it. 
He said several times that "it's good therapy." He gets 
a block of wood and carves it to the necessary shape and then 
places another piece on top. He says he's not a good carver, and 
that he's just learning to make the working decoys and that he's 
not good enough to make the decorative ones, but that he does 
most of 
it by hand, 
instead of using power tools like some others 
He mentioned one person who uses a dremel>. He and John talked 
about the carvers they knew and mentioned one man that's under 
contract to some millionaire to produce four good quality decoys 
a year and that he gets paid so much for them that he can't even 
go to the shows with them. Apparently the decoys are many 
thousands of dollars each. 
They talked too about some of the garvey builders and noted 
that there were "craftsmen" and "builders" and that one man 
painted "hairy garveys," 
garveys which he didn't bother to sand 
down, and which looked fine until you painted them and then 
they'd get hard with the paint and the paint would cling to the 
unsanded wood "like a Crew—cut". They talked too about the boat 
builders that have a well known name, but who do bad 
craftsmanship, nailing odd bits of wood to the deck where the 
breakwater would hide them, 
instead of caring about the quality 
of the wood even where it was unseen. Ed 
talked too about the 
people who ,just drive nails into the wood so that you can see a 
crack where the wood split to allow the nail 
in, 
and that that 
would eventually let water in, 
but that one friend of his would 
drill a hole for each nail so that the wood wouldn't crack or 
split. 
Ed met us at the woodshop, whose floor was covered by an old 
piece of carpeting and wood shavings. The strong smell of cedar 
pervaded the small 
room and there were works 
in progress 
scattered about. Jokingly apologizing for the fact that "his 
cleaning woman had not yet come," he showed us a decoy that he 
was 
in the process of mounting on a piece of driftwood. He told 
us about the process of carving the decoys and we talked about 
the fact that what was missing to make the atmosphere complete 
was an old pot—bellied wood stove in the corner, because the 
electric heat just wasn't quite enough, and his feet get cold on 
the cement floor. I went in 
to the garage to admire his "Boston 
Whaler" and he pointed out a 1940's vintage jeep with historic 
license plates that stood at its side. He talked lovingly about 
the Jeep to John, and noted that it pulls "like a little tank," 
but he doesn't use 
it much now. He said he doesn't have a boat in 
the water now, but that all 
he needs is a ►ittle "pond box"

(sneakbox) to hunt from. We talked about his gunning territory 
and the changes in the Fish and Game laws, and that now there is 
a lottery — first come, first serve — for places, as 
long as they 
are north of the river.

He and John talked too about 
changing 
local family structure through divorce and mobility, not in 
the 
abstract, but 
in terms of particular friends they had 
in common. 
He knew that John had gotten divorced but not that he had 
remarried and not that he was now living 
in Warren Grove in "Mark 
Lane's log cabin." Once again I found myself listening to one of 
the frequent conversations about family geneology 
..."that's 
where Parker lives, up the road..." "Oh, I was talking about a 
different Parker." or "Yeah, the parents are moving into the 
house that their son was 
in and they're selling their house. It's 
a nice place, a big place." 
TX05: G—Stafford; 56GT He 
invited us into the "BS" room inside the 
house, and we sat down beside shelves loaded with his decoys and 
old planes that were once used for making mouldings. There was an 
old wooden trunk as well, filled he said, with more decoys. 
He and John talked at length about decoys and carvers that 
they knew in common, and about the places that they knew along 
Long Beach Island. John had lived there for many years and Ed 
comes from a long 
line of people who did boat related work. He 
has a house in "Mud City (Ocean County) which they use for the 
summer from Memorial Day to Labor Day. 
TX06: G—Stafford; 56GT When John left for a few minutes, to get 
some things at the store since, 
it wasn't possible to run to the 
store back home 
in Warren Grove, Ed and I talked about the 
history of the area. He talked at length about how glad he was 
that we were doing this study, because so much had already been 
lost. He said that there weren't too many of them left, 
like he 
and Jack Cervetto, who really knew the woods and the stories, and 
that when he and few others died there would be no one left who 
knew the history of a few of the farms. He said too that Jack 
knows the woods far better than anyone else around now, and that 
Pearl's "daddy," ? Hazleton Holloway knew the woods very well and 
that he would take Jack out and teach him. He 
too had learned 
the history of the area from the old timers, but that then they 
had obviously had no way to tape 
it and much of 
it was now lost. 
He said that his children only now were becoming interested in 
the old things, places and stories. One day he said, referring to 
me, she'll 
be walking down the street in Warren Grove and they'll 
point at her and say, "now there's a real Piney." 
Having talked about the old ways and places and hunting, 
decoy carving, and boating, John and I prepared to 
leave. We 
stopped to 
look at his two hunting dogs, Molly and Musket Lady, 
who had been talking to Sullivan most of the time we were inside, 
and we discussed the attributes of a good hunting dog. As we 
left

he cautioned me to drive carefully and urged me to come by any 
time, saying that he was always there and that he'd enjoy the 
company, and that since I was a friend of John's and Jack's, that 
was recommendation enough.
