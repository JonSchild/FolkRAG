Is the federal government now "the financial patron of first resort" for
 
the arts?  In Folk Arts and, I suspect, many other Endowment Programs, the
 
federal government is the financial patron of last resort, indeed, of the only
  
resort.
 
One of the three or four remaining highly skilled Haida Indian basket
 
makers of Alaska recently consented to demonstrate for a Folk Arts funded
 
film her centuries old craft.  This is the first time this craft has been
 
carefully documented; it will probably be the last.  A Haida basket is a
 
human invention as breathtakingly original, as nobly utilitarian, as creatively
 
stirring as a Greco-Roman temple, or a grand piano, or a laser-beam sculpture.
 
It is a contribution to human knowledge of the first order of excellence.
 
The private sector has had a long time to fund a film that carefully
 
depicts Haida basketry for the benefit of future generations -
-
perhaps as
 
long as 2
,000 years.  This project, however, awaited the National Endowment
 
for the Arts.
 
For another example from t
he same section of the United States, in
 
February of 1980, the National Council on the Arts approved a grant of
 
$12,860 to the Chukchi Community College to help prepare ten hi-lingual radio
 
programs of Point Hone Eskimo legends and myths.
 Last month, along with a
 
f
ormal re ort concernino the disoosition of these funds, the following letter
 
arrived from the senior is
mo participant:
 
"I told the stories.  Tukummiq translated them.
 I did my best.  To
 
tell them, and the truth about them.
 
"I tried to please.  The papers are the proof of the work.  What is
 
in here, I did my best to tell it right.  Work about our people gets back
 
to us, and we see it.
 
"The things you have written will give you the power to show them what
 
we've done.  Three sticks can't be broken."
 
(
signed) Jimmie Killegvuk
 
Mr. Killegvuk writes not only an admirably concise and business-like
 
letter, he states a profound truth.
 In spite of the fact that, to the Eskimo,
 
these stories represent their Odyssey, their Midnight Ride of Paul Revere, and
 
parts of their Old Testament, actually broadcasting Mr. Killegvuk's versions
 
over the radio required two additional elements: a literal English translation
 
by Mr. Tukummiq, and a further translation by a brilliant young poet, Tom
 
Lowenstein, to create for Anglo ears the literary power of the original texts.
 
This is necessary because there are so few Eskimo speakers left, even among
 
Eskimos.  With those three elements in place, the sticks could not be broken,
 
stories in Eskimo could actually be broadcast over the radio.
 
It seems to me that in one sense the overall work of the Arts Endowment
  
is to help recognize the sticks that must be gathered and the pattern into
  
which they must be aligned before an artistic event of national magnitude
  
and excellence can take place.  This is the part of the job that the private
 
sector does not seem to be very interested in, strangely enough. The private
 
sector seems to like to follow along with the money after the Endowment has
 
made its usually very small investment and has thereby pointed the way to the
 
interesting, the exciting, the creative, the future potential.
 
-2 -
Last week we heard that Mr. Killegvuk, a respected elder of his tribe,
 
died since sending us his letter.  One of the original three sticks is gone,
 
but its place has been taken, however partially, by the radio programs
 
themselves, now safely on tape and available for broadcast to Eskimos across
 
the top of the world.  We did our best too.  We tried to please.
 The papers
 
are the proof of the work.  Three sticks can't be broken.

Notes on Discussion of Herit qe Awards at the Folk Arts
  
Program Policy Meeting (August 13-14, 1981) 
Bess opened disucussion of this topic by stating that priorities
 
for this new category were not yet defined.  Rather,  we hoped
 
that guidelines would emerge from consideration of the body
 
of applications which had already been received.
 
Bert Wilson said that this category had been discussed at the
 
Utah meeting and that some had apprehensions that the awards
 
would go to the more "famous'  traditional artists who were
 
nominated. Dan Patterson said he thought that the first-year
 
selections should include a distinguished list.
 
Jeff Titan asked if the nominations were closed,  and Bess
 
replied that they were not,  although we now had 78 of them.
 
Final selections would be made in December.
 
Next various rating systems were discussed. Worth Long suggested
 
a screening by "rounds"  as a means of prioritizing,  and Charlotte
 
Heth suggested a ranking system in which each nominee would be
 
rated from 1 (outstanding)  to 5 (inappropriate) by each voting
 
panelist.
 
Bert once again brought up the issue of the  "shy flowers,"  those
 
i
ho were not widely known,  and after some discussion,  the panel
 
seemed to agree that both widely-known artists and those who
 
were only appreciated in their own communities should be
 
recognized by the Heritage Award. Most importantly XX,  pabel felt,
 
we should have adequate evidence of their accomplishments so that
 
we can respond to pubilc
 queries. We need,  among other things,
 
good quality photos that could be used for publicity.
 
Then the panel deliberated over the application files independently
 
and each panelist assigned a rating for each nominee according
 
to the system which Charlotte had proposed.
 
When they re-convened, Charlotte moved that panel strike all
 
the 5's,  and after some discussion this strategy was accepted.
 
Once the polling had begun,  Bob Garfias raised a question: Were
 
the ratings to be based on innate artistry,  importance,  or on
 
the person's contribution to a given tradition? Bert and Tim
 
Lloyd joined in the discussion,  asking
 to
 what extent were
 
we trying to honor given traditions rather than individuals.
 
As consideration of particular nominees progressed,  Dan Patterson
 
suggested that we needed to get some kind of form or checklist
 
describing necessary supporting materials which should accompany
 
a nomination and outlining priorities to the nominator. Charlotte
 
agreed that it would be useful to send a form which elicited
 
specific information.

Heritage Awards  (Continued)
 
The question of representing given traditions of folk and traditional
 
artistry in a systematic way was broached. We would,  someone suggested,
 
seek to represent the most important sub-traditions where there were
 
more than one that were closely related. Dan Patterson suggested that
 
we would need a list of traditions  (He said that Alan Tilles of
 
the Smithsonian Institution had prepared such a list which might
 
be adapted to our purposes). Moreover, we would need to start building
 
a list of experts for different areas.  Such an approach might
 
even imply a search for the best representatives of a given
 
tradition.
 
Bill Wiggins felt we should get the people who represent the
 
best in given traditions,  and Tim Lloyd said that he felt that
 
the State coordinators would be glad to join in and help in
 
this. He felt that they would need explicit priorities in order
 
to do so.
 
Bill Wiggins suggested that more than one category might be set up
 
(as in Emmy,  Oscar,  or Pulitzer),  and Jeff Titon raised the question
 
of why there were only 25 awards and why not 100,  for example?
 
Chaizlotte suggested that checklists might be prepared for eliciting
 
information both from nominators and from consultants.  The panel
 
seemed to agree that staff should be empowered to develop systems
 
for collecting information in a systematic way.  These drafts
 
coud be approved by panelists.
 
The question of whether staff should screen applications before
 
their being presented to the panel was also raised  (by Bess),
 
and the appropriateness of multiple applications w
,  those in
 
which a duo or trio or whole community of folk artists were
 
nominated, was considered,  but no concensus was arrived at
 
on this t
hssue.

The p

"Better b

The r

 For t

The i

 point made by
 
Adrian Gnam, d
irector o
f t

g
ram: "The s

t
he r

e
xpressed misgivings: "We a

lans t
o make t
he public more aware
 
o
f s
erious music and c
onte mporary c
omposers.
 
Adrian Gnam admits t
hat he was mildly sur-
prised when Endowment Chairman Frank
 
Hodsoll named h
im d
irector of t
he Music
 
Program i
n April
. "
1 t
hought, t
he way t
hings
 
go i
n t
his world
, I
 d
idn't have a
 c
hance; t
hey'd
 
want t
o b
ring i
n a superstar, some famous
 
name." I
nstead of e
arning fame, Gnam had
 
been earning experience a
s a
ssistant d
irector
 
of t
he Program s
ince 1
976 and acting d
irector
 
s
ince  February  1982 —experience  t
hat
 
proved t
o be more valuable t
han a
 g
lamorous
 
r
eputation.
 
I
n addition t
o h
is years a
t t
he Endow-
ment, Gnam brings t
o h
is position t
he knowl-
edge of a
 professional oboist and conductor.
 
A graduate of t
he College Conservatory of
 
Music  a
t  t
he  University  of Cincinnati,
 
Gnam held t
he principal oboe chair i
n t
he
 
American  Symphony  under  Leopold
 
S
tokowski and i
n t
he Cleveland Orchestra
 
under George Szell
. He was r
ecent/v named
 
music d
irector and conductor of t
he Midland
 
(Michigan)  Symphony  af
ter  having per-
f
ormed f
requent/v a
s guest conductor with
 
s
uch o
rganizations a
s Concerto Soloists of
 
Philadelphia,  New  York's  Orchestra  da
 
Camera, and t
he Colorado Philharmonic.
 
During h
is  t
enure  a
s  a
ssistant d
irector,
 
Gnam continued t
o pursue h
is performing
 
c
areer a
s h
is s
chedule permitted —a pattern
 
he expects t
o continue while d
irector. "
I'm
 
v
ery well-organized and I
 work l
ong hours,"
 
Gnam s
ays, explaining h
is ability t
o handle
 
two c
areers. "
I may have t
o cut back on t
he
 
performing s
ide t
his y
ear," he adds. "But I
 
i
ntend t
o keep i
t
 a
live. Af
ter a
ll
, i
t
 i
s on/v t
he
 
a
rt form t
hat g
ives t
he administrative work
 
meaning for any of u
s."
 
Q
How d
id you g
et i
nvolved i
n being an
 
a
rts administrator a
s well a
s a
 performer?
 
I
 r
ealized v
ery e
arly i
n my c
areer a
s a
 chamber
 
musician —in 1
962 o
r s
o —that you c
annot
 
s
imply p
lay your i
nstrument. You have t
o
 
have management. And p
rofessional manage-
ment costs about 20 p
ercent o
f your f
ee. Take
 
2
0 percent f
rom t
he u
sual $
500 f
ee f
or a
 
c
hamber g
roup, f
igure i
n expenses, and you
 
end up s
ubsidizing your own a
rt f
orm —which
 
i
s what most chamber g
roups do e
ven t
o t
his
 
day.
 
So out o
f n
ecessity, I
 l
earned how t
o p
ro-
mote t
he ensemble —drawing up publicity
 
b
rochures,  writing  p
ress  r
eleases, g
etting
 
bookings. The g
roup I b
elonged t
o, t
he
 
Carnegie  Wind  Quintet,  e
ventually  went

Q
Do you expect t

i

No. At t

t
's more important t
hat
 
t

ive s
omething t
han t
hat
 
i
t g
ive a
 c
ertain amount?
 
That's generally t
rue, but not entirely. The
 
small g
roups —chamber music, j
azz, n
ew
 
music e
nsembles —and s
olo r
ecitalists have a
 
v
ery hard t
ime g
etting booked by p
resenters
 
who o
ften don't want t
o t
ake chances. But
 
t
hese musicians c
an't make a l
iving p
laying
 
i
n a l
iving r
oom and p
racticing. They r
eally
 
have t
o be hustlers, t
elling p
resenters, "We're
 
t
errific.  Here's our r
epertoire l
i
st.  Here's
 
where we've p
layed. Here a
re our r
eviews."
 
And e
ven when t
hey g
et booked, a
s I

t
hey don't e
arn v
ery much. So t
hey n
eed
 
our s

or both t

he
 
r
ecognition.
 
Q
You  mentioned  f
inding  a
lternative
 
means o
f g
etting f
unds. What do you
 
have i
n mind?
 
We i
n t
he Music Program have b
egun an
 
enormous amount o
f a
ctivity w
ith t
he Ford
 
Foundation, t
he Rouse Company, ARCO,
 
Exxon, t

he C

Michael  Paul  Foundation,  Xerox,  and
 
o
thers. There i
s g
reat potential f
or more
 
corporate s

omebody has t
o go
 
out a
fter i
t
. You have t
o convince corpora-
t

t i
s going t
o benefit t
hem, t
he a

o

he community.
 
My p

ear
 
s
even composers i

o

e-
c
eives $50,000 f
rom t

$350,000 f
rom e
ach o
f t

ther s

Next y
ear and t
he f
ollowing y
ear, I
 hope
 
t
here will b
e many more s
uch r
esidencies.
 
The Endowment's important r
ole, t
hough,
 
was not p
rimarily a
s a f
under. I
t was a
s t
he
 
i
nitiator o
f t
he p
roject. Without u
s, t
he whole
 
t
hing might n
ever have happened. I
t
's not
 
how much we g
ive. T
ime and again, once a
 
partnership l
ike t
his has gotten s
tarted, t
he
 
r
atio o
f o
ther s
upport t
o ours has become
 
t
en-to-one o
r twenty-to-one.
 
Another d
imension t
o t
his composers' p
ro-
g
ram i
s t
he possibility f
or expansion and e
n-
l
argement on t
he l
ocal l
evel. Composers
 
s
hould become i
nvolved not only w
ith t
he
 
s
ymphony o
rchestra, but a
lso with t
he whole
 
co mmunity —working  with  choral  and
 
c
hamber g
roups,  g
iving t
hem advice on
 
contemporary p
rogramming, doing guest ap-
pearances  w
ith  t
hem, and working w
ith
 
s
tudent musical ensembles.
 
Q
Do you have any additional i
deas t
hat
 
will put your personal s
tamp on t
he
 
Program now t
hat you a
re t
he d
irector?
 
I
 hope t
o s
tart s
ome n
ew p
rograms t
hat w
ill
 
g
ive musical g
roups new exposure. As I
 s
aid,
 
I
 don't s
ee any need f
or new c
ategories i
n
 
t
he d
isciplines o
f music, but t
here i
s s
t
ill a
 
g
reat need f
or h
elp i
n g
etting n
ew music on
 
r
adio and t
elevision.
 
My f
irst i
dea —which i
s s
t
ill i
n t
he f
orma-
t
ive s
tage —is t
o c
reate a
 TV s
eries, I
t would
 
consist o
f t
hree o
r f
our s
egments on public
 
TV, and would b
e j
ointly f
unded by a
 f
ounda-
t
ion, a
 corporation, t
he Music Program, and
 
t
he Endowment's Media Arts P
rogram. [he
 
s
eries would h
ighlight chamber music, choral
 
music, j
azz, n
ew music, and composers. The
 
g
roups f
eatured would come f
rom a
round t
he
 
country —not  f
rom  t
he  L
incoln  Center-
Kennedy Center environment. Maybe we'd
 
have chamber music f
rom Santa Fe, choral
 
music f
rom Minnesota o
r S
t. Louis, j
azz
 
f
rom Detroit o
r New Orleans o
r Atlanta.
 
The American composer would b
e a key
 
component, t
oo. The composer would have
 
an i
nterview during t
he p
rogram, a
s would
 
t
he performers. Maybe t
here would be a
 part
 
devoted t
o r
ehearsal, and another part s
how-
i
ng young people's p
resentations. The whole
 
p
rogram, a
s I
 envision i
t
, would b
e a
 k
ind o
f
 
Charles Kuralt "On t
he Road w
ith American
 
Music."
 
This i
s important t
o me b
ecause I
 t
hink
 
most Americans have come t
o a
ccept t
he
 
media a
s t
heir way o
f f
inding out what's
 
going on i
n t
he world, what's important i
n
 
t
he world. Every day we s
aw what was hap-
pening i
n t
he Falkland I
slands during t
he
 
war t
here. I
t would b
e g
reat t
o have f
ive
 
minutes e
very day devoted t
o t
he a
rts.
 
Q
What about t
he danger o
f spending t
oo
 
much money on TV —of complaints t
hat
 
money devoted t
o v
ery expensive media
 
p
rojects s
hould be going d
irectly t
o t
he a
rtists
 
and a
rts o
rganizations?
 
That i
s  a v
ery s
hort-sighted v
iew. At t
he
 
moment we p
rovide, f
or s
ome o
rganizations,
 
two p
ercent o
f t
heir entire budget. I
f we t
ook
 
half o
f t
hat —one percent, s
ay —and u
sed i
t
 
f
or media and e
ducational p
rojects, we would
 
b
e doing t
he whole f
ield i
nfinitely more
 
good. There a
re e
xamples we c
an l
ook t
o both
 
i
n music and outside o
f music. Look a
t golf
.
 
There wouldn't be t
he p
eople t
hronging t
o
 
t
he t
ournaments i
f i
t weren't f
or TV.  Music
 
has had i
t
s t
elevision moments, t
oo, o
f course.
 
Charismatic f
igures l
ike Leonard Bernstein,
 
I
saac S
tern, and l
tzhak Perlman have done a
 
l
ot, t
hrough media exposure, t
o popularize
 
s
erious music. But what popularity music
 
has t
oday i
s s
t
ill p
retty much confined t
o t
he
 
s
ymphonic and opera f
ields. We n
eed t

on winning t

f music.
 
Q
You mentioned new educational p
roj-
e
cts. Do you have s
omething s
pecif
ic i
n
 
mind?
 
Yes. Any educational p
roject t
he Endow-
ment becomes i
nvolved i
n has t
o b
e v
ery
 
well-defined and small-scale b
ecause o
f t
he

Local b

egend Henry Townsend: "
I

Well, I

Henry worked a

s
hoe s
hiner, a
 hotel manager, and a
s a
 
s

hose j
obs were a

"
I d

This was during t
he twenties a
nd t
hir-
t
i
es, when music was t
hriving i
n S
t.
 
Louis—and s
o was r
acial d

Henry was p
eriodically a
rrested  on
 
t
rumped-up c

 marked man f

I
n s
pite o
f t
he harassment, Henry had i
t
 
b
etter t
han most b
lacks b
ecause h
e was a
 
musician, a
nd musicians were s
omewhat
 
s
et apart. Most important, h

lack who
 
wanted t

aw o
