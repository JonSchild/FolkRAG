Dr. Carita Doggett Corse c/o Federal Writers' Project Jacksonville, Florida
My dear Dr. Corse:
I am leaving Gainesville today for Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I plan to stop by Jacksonville
to leave at your office the recording machine, together with the records which I have made
recently.
In the event I should fail to see you in your office, I want to tell you that I am confident you
and the Federal Writers' Project and the Federal Music Project of Florida are doing a much
needed and a truly significant work in collecting this folk material from the various Old
World cultures in our state. Florida, it seems to me, had had less of this kind of work done
than has any state in our section of the country, and the intelligent manner in which you
and Mr. Black are furthering this work is, I think, gratifying.
I have had the good pleasure to work with two of your assistants and have been able
to observe their work at first-hand. Both Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Cook are the type of men
who take well with the people from whom we expect to get this material. They are tactful,
diplomatic, and accurate. It is my sincere wish that the work will continue for I am confident
that folklorists, sociologists, historians, and students of Florida culture, in general, will be
able to use this material to a splendid advantage.
