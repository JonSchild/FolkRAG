A ROLLING STONE GATHERS NO MOSS. 
By DAN NASH. 
As we pass along life, how many we see, 
And many there are to be found 
Who are never contented where'er they may be, 
And so constantly come to the ground. 
They always are changing for this and for that, 
Though for reasons they're quite at a 
loss. 
It brings to our mind the saying so pat, 
A 
rolling stone gathers no moss. 
CHORUS. 
So always stick firmly to what you've in view, 
Don't be dazzled by glitter and gloss, 
Remember the maxim, so old yet. so true, 
A 
rolling stone gathers no moss. 
Some people there are, they go in for trade, 
And scarcely stay at it a 
week, 
For they quickly will say a 
mistake they have made, 
And for something quite different seek. 
And then,.. when at last, they make a 
fresh start, 
It's just the same thing as before. 
A 
year hardly goes, they again from it part, 
So these people they live and die poor. 
So always stick firmly, etc. 
So with love, a 
young man falls into its snare, 
And tries to obtain a 
young wife, 
But of constancy true he does not take care, 
So single remains all his life. 
Many ladies we know the same pathway will trace; 
How seldom we find one that's staid, 
She's quickly attracted by ev'ry fresh face, 
She lives and she dies an old maid. 
So always stick firmly, etc. 
Now there is a 
something to learn from my song, 
And for all there's a 
little advice. 
You must all persevere if you want to make way 
On the troublesome highway of life. 
Keep pushing on firmly, though slow it may be; 
And on this you may safely depend, 
Though trials may arise you soon will be free, 
And success will be yours in the end. 
So always stick firmly, etc.

Our interests are both the same, 
That you can plainly see, 
And there should be no reason, 
Why we should disagree; 
Place both on one footing, 
And the world we can defy, 
And if foes think to conquer us, 
They'd better come and try.

THE IRISH PAIR. 
As sung by 301IN M. and ANNIE B-
un.yr. 
ARRALI, blud-a-nounker, dears, 
Arrab, musha, man alive, 
Sure you all can see, 
That we have just arrived, 
From where Patrick he was born, 
Betwixt daylight and morn, 
Ould Ireland's the place I 
mean. 
enor.us. 
Yes, we are an Irish pair, 
An Irish pair 
From the County of Kildare, 
At a 
wake, a 
dance, 
A 
fight or a 
fair, 
We're always to be found. 
Shure OuId Ireland is the place, 
For a 
row or a 
wake, 
If you're not mighty shy, 
Shure they'll blacken up your eyea, 
So look out, me boys, 
If you're not on the right side, 
For the divil is to pay 
When sticks they let fly. 
Yes, we are, etc, 
THE HOD CARRIERS. 
As performed only by the " Bards of Tara," KELLY ct RYAN. 
We are two Irish boys so frisky, 
None better sure you can't find, 
To twirl the twig, or drink strong whiskey, 
Or bate a 
big foe, do ye mind; 
If the four leafed shamrock we could get now, 
All barefooted cripples would be shod, 
No poor needle woman would sit down, 
But be gay, like the boys that carry the hod. 
CHORUS. 
Drink success to Irish labor, 
Just now over from the sod; 
All we want is laborers' wages, 
For we're the boys that carry the hod. 
We'd have no shifting politicians, 
But every man would honest be; 
Old starvation, he'd have no relation, 
And ould Ireland would be free; 
We'd have Saturday night three times a 
week, 
Fine roast beef, and less salt cod; 
Then everyone would be happy, 
Just like the boys that carry the hod. 
Drink success, etc. 
TEDDY IsicGAINTN. 
Written by J. 
D. 
KELLY. 
As sung by BILLY COLLINS. 
MY 
name is Teddy McGann—I 
drive a 
jaunting car, sirs— 
A 
jovial, true-born Irishman—Pm known both near and far, sirs, 
I'm happy and free from care, for nothing is me troublin'; 
A 
better car or faster mare you will not find in Dublin. 
On my car I 
ride, both far and wide; 
I'm known and tried as an Irish guide 
Thro' " Brake " and " Bog " and " Mireland," 
And all the while I 
drive each mile 
The girls all smile at the elegant style 
Of Teddy McGann of Ireland. 
To " Sandy Mount," or " Hill of Howth," or to the " Phnix 
Park," sirs, 
Or any point east, west, or south, I 
drive each gay young spark, 
sirs; 
I 
take my stand on Grafton street when I 
want a 
fare to find, 
sirs, 
And if on my car you take a 
seat, I'll drive you out of your 
minds, sirs. 
On my car I 
ride, etc. 
The ladies, miss or ma, there's one thing that they're wise in, 
Whene'er they want a 
jaunting car it's me they're patronizin' ; 
I 
drive them with such ease, that go where'er they can, sirs, 
They never get a 
car to please like that of Teddy McGann, sirs. 
On my car I 
ride, etc.

came from dear old Ireland, 
We're strangers in this land ; 
We know that all Americans 
Put forth a 
welcome hand 
To the poor of suff'ring Ireland, 
Time and time again; 
We thank you for our countrymen, 
And Donovan is our name !. 
CHORUS. 
We're the Dr7novans! we're the Donovans! 
From the emerald isle across the sea ; 
We're the Donovan's! we're the Donovans 
From a 
neble family. 
Our ancestors were noble 
In the days of King O'Neal; 
They fought for Erin's freedom 
In a 
suit rt silver mail ; 
And royal blood flows in our veins 
We're proud of that sfelf-same; 
We introduce ourielves to you, 
Donovan is our name. 
We're the Donovans etc. 
Oh, Erin, lovely Erin, 
Bright diamond (34 the sea, 
We always sing your praises, 
Wherever we may b4; 
From the lovely banks 
Shannon 
To America we can 
To look around and settle down, 
And Donovan is our name! 
We're the Don( vans, cite.

Music sounds the sweetest, 
When on the moonlit sea, 
We sail in our bark, the fleetest, 
To a 
sweet melody. 
Then, as we're gently sailing, 
We'll sing that plaintive strain, 
Which memory makes endearing, 
And home recalls again.

THE IRISH STRANGER. 
Ok pity the fate of a 
poor Irish str anger, 
That's wandered thus far from his home 
I 
sigh for protection from want. woe and danger, 
But know not which way to roam. 
I 
ne'er shall return to flibernia's bowers, 
For bigotry hath trampled her sweetest of flowefe, 
That gave comfort to me in my loneliest hours, 
They are gone and I'll ne'er see them more. 
With wonder I 
gazed on you lofty building, 
As in grandeur it rose for its lord; 
With sorrow I 
beheld my own garden soon yielding, 
Its choicest of fruits for its board: 
But where is my father's low cottage of clay, 
Wherein I 
did spend many a 
long, happy day, 
Alas! has his lordship removed it away I 
Yes, it has gone, and I'll ne'er see it more. 
When nature was seen on the sloe-bush and bramble, 
Sit smiling in beautiful bloom— 
O'er field without danger I 
used to ramble, 
And lavish amidst her perfume; 
Or range thro' the woods where the gay feather'd thzueig. 
Did joyfully sing their loud-echoing; 
The days, then, of summer passed sweetly along, 
Now they are gone, and 
ue'er see them more. 
When the sloes and the berries hung ripe on the bushes, 
I've gathered them off without harm ; 
And gone to the fields where I've shorn the green — •••3"4‘ 
Preparing for winter's cold storm. 
Or I've sat by the tire on a

Thy sons, many thousands deploring to wander.

America might yield me some snelter from pain..

For the joys that I'll raver see more. 
Farewell then. Erin. and those I 
left weeping

Farewell to each pleasure I

FROM Donegal I've just come o'er, sirs, 
And Barney Ferguson is my name; 
My ancestors lived there before, sirs, 
And proud I

Old Ireland's lads and merry lasses 
I

Their wit and beauty far surpasses , 
All others in the world you'll find.

To Ulster, Munster, Connaught, Leinster, 
The Cove of Cork, and County Clare, 
And Tipperary I 
have been, sir, 
And it's well myself was treated there; 
Old Ireland is the place to roam, sirs, 
Go where'er you may or can ; 
The Irish heart and Irish home, sirs, 
Is open to an honest man.

The east can boast of Dublin City, 
The west is proud of Galway Bay,

IRRAH! MICKEY, PUT YOUR FRIEZE COAT 
ON. 
Aunan I 
Mickey, will ye leave us thus, 
To cross the raging main 7 
When gone, what will become of me, 
Shald you ne'er come back again I 
The hawthorn it may flower in spring, 
The daisy bright may grow— 
But naught to me will comfort bring, 
If you, my darling, go. 
CHORUS. 
Arrali! Mickey, put your frieze coat on, 
Walk through the bog with me ; 
And you can whisper in my ear, 
How dearly you love me. 
What need you leave your native land, 
We've courted many a 
year— 
Then stop where sweet the shamrock grows, 
Stop with your Kathleen dear. 
Though peace and plenty waits you there, 
In that land beyant the sea! 
To break my heart is hardly fair, 
So stop with love and me. 
Arrah! Mickey, etc. 
My granny's got a 
cow and pig, 
An eight-day clock and all; 
With a 
picture of St. Patrick 
That hangs against the wall; 
There's an arm-chair stands beyant the nook, 
Close by the bright turf fire, 
Wilere the" poteen " bottle lies concealed, 
What more can you desire ? 
Arrah I 
Mickey, eta. 
I've got pots and kettles shining bright, 
To deck our cottage out ; 
The boys and girls are waiting, dear, 
The welcome news to shout, 
That you will stay among us all, 
And the lark will sweeter sing, , 
And the bells from every village spire 
The joyful news shall ring.

I' WON'T HEAR OLD IRELAND RUN DOWN 
Written and sung by II ENRY CARNEY, with great applause. 
There's a 
dear little spot call'd the Emerald Isle, 
And there one fine day I 
was born, 
So that is the reason my blood always boils 
When people speak of it with scorn; 
Her sons and her daughters are gallant and fair, 
And the country itself is so grand 
That I 
cannot imagine why people should speak 
In dispraise of my dear native land, 
CHORUS. 
So—Hurrah for old Ireland, the land of my birth, 
Her sons have gained famous renown, 
'Tis known as a 
glorious picture on earth, 
So I 
wont hear old Ireland run down I 
I'm sure no Irishman ever need be 
Ashamed of those heroes gone by, 
Who fought like true Irishmen only can do 
When foes of their country were nigh; 
And in modern times, when for England they fought, 
They were foremost and first in the fray, 
And at the Crimea when danger was near, 
Pat never kept out of the way. 
So—Hurrah for old Ireland, etc. 
The name of O'Connell, and all such as he, 
Should make every Irishman proud; 
They were Ireland's heroes, and showed that they were 
With wit and with wisdom endowed: 
They spoke for their country, as every man should, 
No matter what country or creed; 
So we never need be ashamed of Ireland's sons, 
For they proved true in thought, word, and deed. 
So—Hurrah for old Ireland, etc.

ST. 
PATRICK'S MORN. 
Written and sung with great success by HENRY CARNEY, at TONY 
PASTOR'S Theatre, New York. 
THERE'S a day that comes but once a 
year—the 17th of 
March, 
And upon it every Irishman is drinking; 
All the girls are dressed so gay, and the pipers—how they 
play ! 
And the boys at all the pretty girls are winking, 
Then we all put on the green, and we just feel all serene, 
While the shamrock is our button holes adorning ; 
And every mother's son makes his mind up for some fun 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
Then shout Hurrah for Erin, the land that gave me birth, 
And the darling little shamrock don't be scorning ; 
Such a 
sight ye've never seen as the wearing of the green 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Upon St. Patrick's eve, when our daily work we leave, 
Every Irishman is frolicsome and frisky ; 
He's a 
coin or two to spend, and another for to lend, 
And at home he's got a 
stinging taste of whiskey. 
At night he goes to bed feeling quare about the head, 
And he snores until the day is gently dawning ; 
Then he wakes and rubs his eyes, and then " Bedad," he 
cries, 
"It's St. Patrick's day in the morning." 
Then shout Hurrah, etc. 
And when parade begins, oeh, it's murther for our shins, 
Such hustling and bustling and squeezing; 
Then of drink there's such a 
lot, and it's always thunder-
ing hot, 
So there's little chance of anybody freezing. 
Then the baud and pipes are blowin' to the chune of 
" 
Garry Owen," • 
For to have another chune we would be scorning. 
It's the finest bit of spree that ever you did see 
On St. Patrick's day in the morning. 
Then shout Hurrah, etc.

TEDDY REILLY. 
Written and sung by DAN Nesn. 
'INIT heart is broke in fifty lumps, 
And my back is bent in two, 
All through one Teddy Reilly, 
-Who to me has proved untrue. 
Teddy saird away from me 
Unto a 
foreign part; 
Faith, he broke my nose before he went, 
And then he broke my heart. 
CHORUS. 
Oh then pity the misfortunes 
Of a 
poor mild crature, 
Who goes out a 
washing 
For a 
shilling a 
day, 
Whose love from me has parted 
And left me broken hearted, 
Since my darling Teddy Reilly 
Cross'd the great big sea. 
0 my Teddy was the finest man 
That ever stole a 
cow, 
He was fond of a 
drop of the eye-water, 
And still fonder of a 
row; 
He'd fight from night until morning, 
From morning until night, 
And he'd always practice on myself 
Whenever he wants a 
fight.

That pigs, no more than ourselves, can see anything in the

" 
PETER AND PAUL." 
By 
DAN NASH. 
Now Peter and Paul were remarkable chaps, 
Who long ago battled with worldly mishaps, 
Their lives were a 
series of woes and complaints, 
For, as you all know, they were very great saints, 
I 
saw them one night (you may think it absurd) 
In a 
dream, and I 
chanced to hear every word; 
So, if yon will listen, I'll sing to you all 
The remarkable sayings of Peter and Paul. 
Said Paul unto Peter, how changed things appear, 
How wicked and vicious seems everything here ; 
Divorces in high life each mind must appal. 
Oh, that is refinement, said Peter to Paul, 
In our days, we ne'et had such sin to disguise; 
The mark of refinement was never " black eyes," 
Now, murders are looked on as nothing at all. 
Is this education ? said Peter to Paul. 
Said Paul unto Peter, distress now prevails 
Throughout every city in England and Wales; 
Families are starving, trade's gone to the wall. 
Oh, isn't it awful ? said Peter to Paul. 
(1) 
Collections are made for each foreign appeal, 
Yet England her poverty strives to conceal. 
If they'd loOk to their own who to poverty fall, 
It would do them more credit, said Peter to Paul. 
Said Paul unto Peter, the world is a 
sham, 
And with its surroundings disgusted I 
am, 
Nothing is pure, they adulterate all. 
It's worse than disgraceful, said Peter to Paul, 
In our days we all could believe our own eyes; 
We knew the ingredients of penny meat pies; 
It makes my blood boil as those days I 
recall, 
I'm getting disgusted, said Peter to Paul. 
Said Paul unto Peter, the world's going wrong; 
Even England wants that which to her don't belong ; 
The Afghans, the Zulus, have been made to fall. 
Oh, ain't it disgraceful ? said Peter to Paul. 
If those in authority had but to fight, 
Their language would be very different quite, 
In fact, there would really be no war at all, 
And that's my opinion, said Peter to Paul.

DENNIS DEAR, ARE YOU FORGETTING ? 
As sung by Miss Josm Morons, in the " Grand Hibernica." 
the Music of this Song is published by WarrrEmosx,-Detroit, Mich. 
DENNIS dear, are you forgetting. 
That your Kathleen's waiting here ? 
For you promised that in spring time, 
That you surely would be near; 
Long the flowers have been blushing, 
And daisies blooming on the lea. 
Come back, Dennis, I'm so lonely, 
Darling, soon return to me, return to me. 
CLIORITS 
Dennis, dear, are you forgetting 
Your own Kathleen o'er the sea 7 
Come back Dennis, I'm so lonely, 
Darling, soon return to me. 
Dennis dear, are you forgetting 
All the tales of love you told 7 
When you said " gool bye" at parting. 
Round me then your arms did fold; 
Write a 
letter to me, Dennis, 
0 ! tell me that you'll soon be near, 
And I'll wait just by the sea shore, 
For the good ship to appear to me, to me. 
Dennis, dear, etc. 
THE BELLS OP SHANDON: 
Composed by FATHER TROUT. 
With deep affection and recollection, 
I 
often think of those Shandon bells, 
Whose sound so wild, would, in days of ohildisuott, 
Fling o'er my fancy their magic spells. 
On this I 
ponder, where'er I 
wander, 
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, a 
tadv, 
With thy bells of Shandon, 
That sound so grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lae. 
I've heard bells chiming full many a 
clime in. 
Tolling sublime in Cathedral shrine, 
While at glibe rate brass tongues would vibrate, 
But all their music spoke not like thine! 
For mem'ry, dwelling on each proud swelling 
Of the belfry knelling its bold notes free, 
MIade the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand. on 
The pleasant waters of the river tee. 
Tve heard bells tolling old Adrian's mole In— 
Their thunder rolling from the Vatican— 
And cymbals glorious, swinging uproarious 
In the gorgeous turrets of Notre-Dame; 
Itut thy sounds were sweeter than the dome ol fete 
Flings o'er the Tiber, pealing solemnly— 
Oh! the Bells of Shandon 
Sound far more grand on 
The pleasant waters of the river Lee. 
There's a 
bell in Moscow, while on tower and Zroak.e, 
In St. Sophia the Turkman gets; 
And loud, in air calls men to prayer, 
From the tapering turrets of tall minarets; 
Buch an empty phantom I 
freely grant then' 
But there's an anthem more dear to me— 
'Tis the Bells of Shandon, 
That sound more grand on 
The &
want waters of the river Lee!

NEVER MARRY YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW. 
By DAN NAsu. 
THERE'S a 
very old saying, as old as the hills, - 
The truth of which you'll agree, 
That while two together is good company, 
There's none to be had when there's three; 
I 
once had a 
charmer, sweet Miss Jones, 
But my bliss has proved quite a 
sell; 
For I 
quickly discover'd I 
also bad wed 
My own Jennie's mother as well. 
CHORUS. 
In two there is company, three there is none, 
If you would not your happiness flaw, 
Just take my advice when you marry your wife, 
Never marry your Mother-in-Law. 
Our sweet country days I 
ne'er shall forget, 
The walks and the talks were divine ; 
So I 
quickly make up my mind to propose, 
And pressed the fair girl to be mine. 
She accepted, and all the arrangements complete, 
From the church doors I 
led her my wife, 
It has proved the worst step I 
ever did take, 
The worst I 
e'er took in my life. 
In two there is company, etc. 
(

NEVER MARRY YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW.— 
• 
Concluded. 
Our honeymoon over, to town we returned, 
Then came to my bliss the first flaw, 
For to my surprise at the doorway I 
saw 
My own darling Mother-in-Law. 
My wife said, " Dear Charlie, you pray must forgive, 
I 
quite meant to mention it, dear, 
In order to add to our comfort and joy, 
Dear mother will dwell with us here." 
In two there is company, etc. 
From that very clay there's been nothing but strife, 
I'd rather be single by far; 
For my wife will do nothing before, as she says, 
She goes and consults dear mamma. 
Mamma can do this, mamma can do that, 
In fact dear mamma reigns supreme, 
While in my own house I'm a 
figure of nought, 
My Mother-in-Law is the queen. 
In two there is company, etc. 
All single young fellows, just listen to me, 
If you e'er think of taking a 
wife; 
Remember it's not for a 
day or a 
year, 
But 'tis for the whole of your life. 
If you want to be happy the whole of your days, 
With freedom from all that will bore ; 
If your Mother-in-Law wants to marry you too, 
Be sure that you fasten the door. 
In two there is company, etc.

THE BELLS.-CONCLUDED. 
Alas! I 
soon recalled my words, 
I 
cry as now I 
roam, 
"Oh! why did I 
get mar-ri-ed? 
Why did I 
leave my happy home?" 
SPOKEN.-Why did I 
leave the home where I 
was free to do as 
I 
liked? There if I 
did not feel inclined to eat my crusts, I 
was 
allowed to place them under the tea-tray, which I 
considered 
was " tray bang" (Ttes bien). 
Now if I 
don't eat my crusts, she 
places my crust under the tea-tray, and you can very often hear 
the " tray bang," the consequence is I 
often have an optical de-
lusion of about five hundred stars, and an auricular delusion of 
the same number-
Of bells ringing merrily, &c. 
3 I 
rise each morn at six o'clock, 
Because it's her desire. 
And minus trousers, socks, or shoes, 
I 
light the kitchen fire. 
I 
wait upon her hand and foot, 
But if I 
out should be, 
And get home rather late at night, 
She kindly waits on me, 
RPOKEN.-With a 
big stick; of course it's very kind of her to 
sit up for me, it's very kind of her to open the door for me, but 
when she carries her kindness to the extent of prostrating me on 
the one and eleven-penny door mat, then, I 
fail to see the joke. 
I 
never attempt to rise; if I 
did it would only necessitate her 
knocking me down again, so I 
generally tie myself up in a 
knot, 
go to sleep, perchance to dream, to dream of the day when-
The bells they rang, &c. 
4 I 
cannot do a 
thing aright, 
I 
cannot speak correct, 
And if I 
stoop I'm call'd "a 
fright," 
Yet must not stand erect. 
I 
often wish that I 
were dead, 
Or never had been born, 
Or never had been mar-ri-ed, 
On that unlucky morn. 
SPOKEN.-Wilen I -0
-et very low-spirited. I 
generally go to the 
little church around the John Homer Esquire, and there I 
be-
hold ' two more on'em " roing in; at least, I 
suppose there are

can see her, he poor follow is hidden somewhere in the 
folds of her dress. ready to be drag.
,.red forth when required. 
When the deed is done, the mournful procession wends its way 
into the aisle, he happy mortal looking as cheerful as if he had 
taken a 
dose of rat poison, she looking gay and festive, as much 
as to say, "Girls I 
have got him." 
The pew-opener wishes him 
joy, and then- as they did on our day-
The bells they rang, 6:c.

WATERFORD BOYS. 
Ant :—" The Flaming ainannigane." 
Well, boys, for divarsion, we all met together; - 
I'll tell you how from Waterford hither I 
came, 
I 
left that dear city in dark, gloomy weathr, 
My heart it was light, and my pockets the same, 
I 
lilted a 
song as I 
tripped it along; 
Dy the road-side a 
tavern I 
happened to spy, 
ilnd, as I 
was meltin', my pockets I 
felt in 
For the price of a 
drink; I 
was mortally dry. 
But we are the boys for fun, wit, and element, 
Drinking, and dancing, and all other joys, 
Ructions, destruction, divarsion, and decilment; 
Who can compare with the Waterford Boys? 
In the tavern I 
strohed, oat the landlord he rolled; 
Good mornire, says he. 
Says I: If you please, 
Could you shake me a 
bed, hut first bring some bread, 
With a 
bottle of porter and small lump of cheese ? 
For, times they are queer, and provisions are dear; 
If you cannot get meat, with cheese be content. 
Says the landlord: You're right, as he brought me the bito 
So, I 
rolled up my sleeves and at it I 
went. 
Weare the boys, &c. 
!fly bread and cheese ended, I 
then condescended 
To seek my repose: so, I 
bade 'em good-night. 
Soon under the clothes I 
was trying to doze, 
But first popped in my toes, and then popped out the light. 
6fot long was I 
sleeping, I 
heard something creeping, 
And meanderiag, and scratching about the bed-post. 
WATERFORD BOYS.—{coNcLunra).} 
My breath I 
suspended, but the noise never ended: 
Thinks I; ye have mighty long claws for a 
ghost! 
We are the boys, dro. 
The row it commences: near out of my senses, 
I 
ventured to peep from beneath the bed-clothes. 
Milla murther! what's that ? 'Twas a 
big black jack rat, 
With a 
leap from the floor, came a 
top of my nose. 
Divil swape ye! says I, for a 
scheming ould vagabone; 
Take that, and that. 
I 
jumped on the floor; 
Oh! Moses; blue fire, Biddy! Sophia ! 
The rats they are eating me up by the score 
We are the boys, (ft. 
The landlord affrightened, he then brought a 
light in. 
Says I: I'm Lear dead, it's time I'm away; 
Says he: Before going, I'd have ye be knowing, 
For supper and bed you've five shillings to pay. 
Five shillings! for what ? Now, don't be disgracing 
Yourself as a 
rogue, says I, if you please; 
Whea I 
can't sleep for rats, you've the divil's own face on ye, 
To charge me five shillings for plain bread and cheese 1 
We are the boys, &c. 
Says he: Och! those rats, I 
wish they would leave me, 
They ruin my trade. 
I'm not worth a 
rap. 
Says I: The five shillings now would you forgive me, 
If I 
tell you the way to keep out every rat ? 
I 
will.—Says I: Then to supper invite them, 
And plain bread and cheese set before them, be sure, 
Don't mind if they're willing, but charge them five shillings 
Bad luck to the rat that ye'll ever see more 
We are the boys, &a.

NORAH JOHANNA M cCARTHY. 
Cemposed and sung by P., J. DOWNEY. 
Mary, the Pride of the Dairy." 
I 
RECEIN ED an invite to attend a 
large party, 
The Ladies Choice Social, up at Stella Hall ; 
I 
put on my best clothes, white necktie and collar, 
Plug hat, with new gaiters to dance at the ball. 
Of girls I 
had plenty to go along with me, 
They said I 
was always so gay and so free; 
I 
took Miss McCarthy, so young and so pretty, 
She swore at the party the belle she would be. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Norah Johanna McCarthy, 
She Swore she'd be belle of the party, 
If any would slight, she was ready to fight, 
Was Norah Johanna McCarthy. 
The fun it commenced with a 
two hand kertillion, 
Norah went at it with hop, step and jump, 
Killfeather he tripped her, oh, boys, what a 
ruction, 
Norah's poor body received a 
great bump. 
Her legs they flew up, she had on striped stockings, 
She bounced off her bustle, her head hit the wall, 
Oh, boys, she's a 
ripper, cried old Paddy Coldwell. 
You lie, said O'Brien, she's the belle of the ball. 
Oh, .Norah Johanna, etc. 
Come, boys, cried out Norah, it's time for the supper. 
Hold on, said Miss Dunn, you're an hour to soon; 
Oh, boys, cried out Norah, to me she's dictating, 
Look out, and I'll gouge her eye out with a 
spoon. 
It's then that the Connellys, O'Briens, and Dounellys, 
Fagans, the Hagans for help they did call, 
With sleeves to the muscle, she pulled off her bustle, 
Oh, boys, cried out Paddy, she'll murder us all. 
Oh, Norah Johanna, etc.

Ara.— ,, 
Casey's Social Club." 
OF 
a 
fine young man I 
am going to sing, 
His age is two hundred and nine ; 
He is a 
conductor of an ash-cart, 
And his name is Mike O'Brien. 
His feet would measure thirty-four, 
Faith they'd cover up a 
block ; 
The springs of his pants covers up his shoes, 
And his face would break a 
clock. 
CHORUS. 
For the girls says he is a 
daisy, 
He is the duck of a 
flock of geese ; 
His nose is roaming all over his face, 
And he can waltz on a 
three-cent piece; 
He beats his way at every ball, 
His shoes are twenty-nine; 
The first man ever wore tight pants, 
Was Michael James O'Brien. 
He looks like the handle of a 
broom, 
Or a 
broken telegraph pole; 
He goes down to Hardly-Able Hall, 
And waltzes for a 
ton of coal; 
He is always at the matinees, 
To try and catch a 
mash ; 
With his twenty shilling overcoat, 
He thinks he cuts a 
dash. 
For the girls says, etc. 
His mother raised him up a 
pet, 
He never worked a 
day; 
He sprinkles balloon juice on his hair, 
And buys his clothes down the bay. 
He'd make a 
good sign for a 
cigar store; 
With the girls he is No. 1, 
And if you ask him what he works at, 
Faith he'd say he is a 
banker's son. 
For the girls says, eta. 
GREENHORN ON THE FLY. 
Revised and sung by JOHNNY ROACH with great success. 
Goon people all, take my advice, and listen unto me, 
But don't put too much confidence in every man you see. 
They say fine feathers make fine birds, but not so every 
one, ' 
For men will often wear broadcloth, to hide their little 
game, 
But whether they are fish or fowl it makes no difference 
to I, 
I 
know my business, you can bet, I'm a 
greenhorn on the 
fly. 
There's Madame Morris from Corsica, who with her tele-
scope, 
Your future wife or husband shows—good gracious I 
that's 
a 
joke. 
If you give to her but fifty cents, she'll send you a 
card 
by mail, 
I 
think they ought to find her a 
home, six months in the 
county jail. 
There's the seventh daughter of the seventh son, to swin, 
die you they'll try, 
But I 
know their little euchre game, I'm a 
greenhorn on 
the fly. 
In Chatham street the other day I 
took a 
walk along, 
I 
heard a 
fellow crying out, going, going, gone. 
Who bids for it, this fine gold watch, the finest ever seen. 
They thought I 
was a 
little flat—perhaps a 
little green— 
I 
says, excuse me, please, if I 
wink so with my eye, 
I 
know my business, you can bet I'm a 
greenhorn on the 
fly. 
There are fifty kinds of swindling-mills in the papers 
every day, 
And lotteries where you draw a 
farm (God knows how far 
away) ; 
The police say they searched very hard to find old Stew-
art's corpse, 
But I 
don't think they looked very far from the city of 
New York. 
If Judge Hilton had been wise, my friends, fifty thousand 
dollars he might have laid by, 
If he'd given that job to some one else,says the greenhorn 
that is fly.

JOHN MONAHAN'S DOISIWPTY. 
Sang by JAmEs BRADLEY, at the Eagle Theatre, with great success 
I'vE got a 
donkey, he stands six foot high, 
I'll sell to the man that wishes to buy ; 
He drinks seltzer water whenever he's dry, 
In a 
run on the turf sure he never proved shy ; 
He makes good time, one mile a 
day, 
I'll match him against any stallion or bay ; 
He fought for his country, been all through the war, 
I 
feed him on herrings, hay, rope and tar. 
CHORUS. 
I 
got a 
donkey, 
He's not very chunkey, 
I'll trade for a 
monkey 
To any old flunkey; 
Wouldn't that be hunkey 
If he had my donkey, 
And I 
had his monkey, 
And donkey also 
When he's locked in his stable he makes a 
stiff kick, 
He wants to get out, he pretends he is sick; 
I 
call out my donkey, his name it is Dick, 
I 
coax him along with a 
hickory stick ; 
If I 
leave in his box a 
big bale of hay, 
He'll eat it all up, leave none for next day; 
Last week he broke loose and of course went astray, 
He was found in a 
sewer in Avenue A. 
I 
got a 
donkey, etc. 
I 
harnessed him up last St. Patrick's day, 
I 
rode on his back so cheerful and gay ; 
We started from the corner of Tenth and Broadway, 
We got to the Hall without any delay ; 
Just as I 
was turning into the park 
Some one fired a 
pistol, just for a 
lark ; 
The donkey fell down which caused a 
blockade. 
Only for fifty horse doctors he'd spoil the parade. 
I 
got a 
donkey, •te.

In Ballinahack there resides an mild man. 
That can handle a

For his tinkering trade he's a 
beautiful plan, 
And his name is ould Paddy McCarthy. 
He rises at seven his work to begin, 
And he wallops away wid his sodder an tin, 
The girls wid their tay pots and kitties come in 
To be mended by Paddy McCarthy. 
On Fridays he goes to the market at Clare, 
Wid fresh lard on his brogues, and the same en Me

He gets drunk and throws his hat in the air, 
Who wants to fight says old Paddy Mc Carthy.

Who can chanter a

They fought for two hours, but he murdered poor Mae, 
Wid a

Poor Paddy is dead, now the solderin' rogue, 
Tho' that left handed skelp from G'illoughly's kithogne 
Every boy in the village will lay a

NANCY MOONEY. 
Written and sung by "HENRY CARNEY" with great succeses. 
OCHONE, weirastbrue! sure ray heart's nearly breaking; 
Farewell of my senses I'm sure I 
am taking; 
Thro' thinking of Nancy, asleep or awaking, 
I'm just like a 
long fishing rod. 
My bosom with anger and sorrow does throb, 
Aich breath that I 
take is turned into a 
sob ; 
I'm as wake as a 
drink of could water, by gob, 
I 
wish I 
was under the sod. 
CHORUS. 
Desateftil Nancy Mooney, of me you've made a 
looney, 
You know since we were childther on you I've been 
spooney ; 
If you don't dhrop gallavantin' with that blackguard, 
Mickey Rooney, 
I'll dhrown myself, and thin my ghost will haunt you 
night and day. 
Ochone, weirasthrue ! black-eyed Nancy Machree, 
I 
know you're too good for a 
fellow like me; 
But as sure as the birds love the leaves on the tree 
I 
love you far dearer than life. 
If you'll only become Mrs. Mulligan soon 
I'll sing like a 
bird in the sweet month of June, 
And I'll hop on one leg from Drundish to the moon, 
The day that I 
make you my wife. 
Desatefal Nancy Mooney, etc. 
Altho' I 
am delicate, lonely, and wake, 
I'll smash every skull in the land for your sake, 
I'll pitch the could castle right into the lake, 
I'll ride Prince O'Donoughne's horse, 
I'll swear by all colors—black, Tiller, or red,— 
That I'll smash like a 
turnip Mick Rooney's big head; 
You have broke my poor heart—och, I 
wish I 
was dead, 
Then you might shed a 
tear o'er my corse. 
Desabeful Nancy Mooney, etc. 
CAOCH, 
THE PIPER.—Concluded, 
CAOCH, 
THE PIPER. 
By J. KEEGAN. 
ONE winter's day, long—long ago, 
When I 
was a 
little fellow, 
A 
piper wandered to our door, 
Grey-headed, blind, and yellow-
And oh I 
how glad was my young heart. 
Though earth and sky looked dreary— 
To see the stranger and his dog— 
Poor " Pinch " and Caoch O'Leary. 
And when he stowed away his " bag," 
Cross-barred with green and yellow, 
I 
thought and said : " In Ireland's ground 
There's not so fine a 
fellow." 
And Fineen Burk and Shane Magee, 
And Eily, Kate, and Mary, 
Rush in, with panting haste, to " see," 
And " welcome " Caoch O'Leary. 
Oh, God be with those happy times, 
0 1 
God be with my childhood, 
When I, bare-headed, roamed all day 
Bird-nesting in the wild-wood— 
I'll not forget those sunny hours, 
However years may vary ; 
I'll not forget my early friends, 
Nor honest Caoch O'Leary. 
Poor Caoch and " Pinch " slept well that night, 
And in the morning early 
He called me up to hear him play 
" 
The wind that shakes the barley." 
And then he stroked my flaxen hair, 
And cried : " God mark my deary," 
And how he wept when he said : " Farewell, 
And think of Caoch O'Leary." 
And seasons came and went, and still 
Old Caoch was not forgotten, 
Although I 
thought him " dead and gone," 
And Li the cold clay rotten. 
And often when I 
walked and danced 
With Eily, Kate, and Mary, 
We spoke of childhood's rosy hours, 
And prayed for Caoch O'Leary. 
( 
1 ) 
Well—twenty summers had gone past, 
And June's red sun was sinking, 
When I, a 
man, sat by my door, 
Of twenty sad things thinking. 
A 
little dog came up the way, 
His gait was slow and weary, 
And at his tail a 
lame man limped— 
'Twas " Pinch " and Caoch Olenry. 
Old Caoch ! but ah! how woe-begone 1 
His form is bowed and bending, 
His fleshless bands are stiff and wan, 
Ay—Time is even blending 
The colors on his threadbare " bag "— 
And " Pinch" is twice as hairy 
And " thin-spare " as when first I 
saw 
Himself and Caoch O'Leary. 
" 
God's blessings here," the wanderer cried, 
" 
Far— far be hell's black viper ; 
Does any body hereabouts 
Remember Caoch the Piper ? " 
With swelling heart I 
grasped his hand ; 
The old man murmured " Deary ! 
Are you the silky-headed child 
That loved poor Caoch O'Leary ? " 
"Yes—yes," I 
said—the wanderer wept 
As if his heart was breaking— 
" 
And where, a 
lilac machree,"* he sobbed, 
" 
Is all the merry-making 
I 
found here twenty years ago ? "— 
" 
My tale," I 
sighed, " might weary, 
Enough to say—there's none but me 
To welcome Caoch O'Leary." 
"Vo—Vo—Vo 1" the old man cried, 
And wrung his hands in sorrow, 
" 
Pray lead me in, asthore machree, 
And I'll go home to morrow.

Soil of my heart,

GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR. 
As sung by JACK CONROY with immense success. 
The Music of this song will be sent to any address, post paid, on receipt 
of price, 10 cents. 
MY 
grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood side by side. 
To my brother it was found, she had left a hundred 
pounds, 
The same unto my sister, I 
declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said, " I 
see, 
She has left to you her old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they tittered, how they chaffed, 
How ray brother and sister laughed, 
When they heard. the lawyer declare, 
Granny had only,left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the evening took the chair away; 
The neighbors they me chaffed, my brother at me 
laughed, 
And said it will be Itaettil John gome day. 
(1) 
GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR.—Concluded. 
When you settle down in life, find some girl to be your 
wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare ; 
On a 
cold frosty night, when the fire is burning bright, 
You can sit in your old arm-chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
What My brother said was true, for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say, I 
settled down in married life; 
I 
first a 
girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church, and when she was ray wife 
The old girl and me were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over, I 
declare, 
ne'er abroad would roam, but each night would stay at 
home, 
And be seated in my old arm- chair. 
And how they tittered, etc. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
picked it up I 
found 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor; 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more. 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage, and tore his hair, 
_ 
But I 
only laughed at him, then said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm-chair ? 
And howi they titiLVd., et

HOLD ON JOHNNY, 
HOLD ON JACK. 
By DAN NASH. 
W HEN I 
was a 
little boy my father used to say 
Some very funny things to me, advice he'd give each 
day, 
Be sure now as you older grow from trouble, boy, keep 
back ; 
And don't forget your old dad's words, be sure you hold 
on, Jack! 
CHORUS. 
Hold on, Johnny, hold on, Jack, 
Keep a 
little steady, boy, and hold a 
little back; 
You can soon get into trouble, 
Through a 
very little bubble, 
So hold on, Johnny, hold on Jack. 
This sound advice I 
shortly found would useful be in-
deed, 
For often have those simple words well stood me when in 
need, 
They've frequently prevented me from acting indiscreet, 
And fitted me to better bear the ills I've had to meet. 
Hold on, Johnny, etc. 
Two strangers at a 
luncheon bar invited me to drink, 
What made them so extremely kind I 
really could not 
think, 
They seern'd so interested too in all I 
did and said, 
I 
felt compelled to take a 
glass, for which they freely 
paid. 
Hold on, Johnny, etc. 
I 
fell in love and courted once a 
damsel fair to view, 
And nightly saw her to her door to bid the last adieu, 
And there we'd talk of happier days, likewise connubial 
bliss, 
Reluctant both to say good-night and give the parting 
kiss. 
Hold on, Johnny, etc. 
I 
never shall forget one night I'd to a 
supper been, 
Most social and the best laid out that ever I 
had seen, 
I 
thoroughly enjoyed myself, but when I 
got outside, 
I 
found it difficult to walk and could not get a 
ride. 
SPOKEN. — What a .difference going to a 
supper and 
coming hdme from one. 
When I 
came, I 
said, 
Hold on, Johnny, etc.

SINCE MICHAEL LEARNED TO DANCE. 
Bung by JOHN KERNEL". 
MY 
name it is O'Donovan, 
I 
live in Jersey City, 
I 
have three boys, and four big girls, 
On me they have no pity; 
My eldest boy's about nineteen, 
He sings a 
song called " Dancing on the Green," 
Not a 
day's luck in the house is seen 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He has all the boys and girls taught 
To waltz around upon their toes ; 
He practised kicking yesterday noon, 
And busted all his clothes ; 
He comes from the theatre about daylight, 
And says with the actors he had a 
terrible fight., 
The house is a 
circus from morn till night, 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He brought home stuff he called burnt cork, 
Which he says he got at the play halls; 
He broke the clock, 
Trying to stand on his head; 
While he done some funny falls; 
As an actor he says he's great, 
My family to Hoboken must emigrate, 
Since Michael learned to dance. 
He calls his sister a 
leading lady. 
He wrote a 
drama, called tile " Stolen Cheese," 
Ile played a 
year at Sing Sing, 
Doing a 
cornet solo upon a 
high trapeze; 
The manager told him to write again, 
He doubled up with Geo. Francis Train, 
Begorra, I 
have water on the brain, 
Since Michael learned to dance.

W E'RE a 
gallant brigade from Erin's isle, 
And many a 
fight we've won ; 
We'll dance a 
step or take a 
smile, 
And our comrades never shun; 
When dress'd in.regimentals, 
Sure of none we are afraid! 
And we are known where'er we go 
As men of the gallant brigade, 
cmonns, 
The gallant brigade is never afraid 
To meet a 
friend or foe; 
We're sure to make a 
grand hurrah, 
Wherever we may go— 
With trumpet and gun we march away 
In a 
beautiful parade, 
And we're so proud we charm the crowd 
To cheer for the gallant brigade. 
We're first in the field, all brave and true, 
If war should call us out; 
And when we're home we pass our time 
In showing the girls about; 
I've often heard them sigh and wish 
That they could be arrayed 
In uniforms of blue and green 
Like those of the gallant brigade. 
The gallant brigade, etc. 
On the Fourth of July and Patrick's Day 
We're out in glorious style, 
While the stars and stripes and Ireland's flag 
Above us wave the while; 
The glories of this nation then 
In fancy are displayed, 
And at night we drink a 
parting glass 
To America's gallant brigade.

[Copyright, 1875, by ROBERT M . 
DEW ITT.] 
A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS. 
[Scene, a 
cabin with an open window. 
Enter TEDDY, with a 
bundle slung over his shoulder.] 
TEDDY.—I've had a 
hard time of it here in ould Erin, and 
although I've tried to keep up my spirits for the sake of my 
dear colleen, I've at last been forced to go over the sea. 
It's 
hard, hard times in the ould land, and I 
must be off to the 
new. 
But do you think that I 
ever can forget you, Erin dar-
ling? 
Bad luck to the Irishman that ever did! 
One more 
sweet kiss from the girl I 
love, and then for the big ship. 
This is Biddy's cabin. 
She must be up. 
I'll knock. 
[Knocks 
xt cabin door.] 
Biddy acushla 1 
[BIDDY at the open window.] 
BIDDY. — Is that you, Teddy ? 
TEDDY.— Yes, darlint, and I'm going away; sr. 
thought I'd 
come and say good-bye. 
BIDDY.—Going away so soon? 
TEDDY.— Yes, darlint; but it won't be for 16ng. 
I'll soon 
clasp you to my heart again, and we shall be as happy as the 
starling. 
BIDDY.— But you'll forget me, Teddy; they say there's pret-
tier faces over there than you'll find at home, to steal away 
your heart. 
TEDDY.— I it prettier faces there than here ? 
Why, beau-
tiful girls in ould Ireland are as plentiful as the daisies; and 
you are the queen of them all. 
I 
could never forget you, 
Biddy; don't speak like that. 
Sure among ten thousand lovely 
girls I 
couldn't see one but you. 
[Music plays the symphony of Ike song. 
BIDDY and TEDDY 
clasp hands at the window.] 
TEDDY sings. 
Then here I 
am an Irishman, 
I'm always fond of mirth; 
But show me the creature 
Would slight me for my birth.

GOOD-
Y, BIDDY DEAR.—[CoNTINtErid - 
And here's my sweet colleen 
I'm forced to leave behind ; 
I 
always was the broth of a 
boy, 
And my true love she is kind. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
TBiddy 
0! 0! 0! good-bye, dear; 
eddy 
'Tis hard to part from you; 
Although we're going to sever, 
My heart it will prove true. 
Then cheer up, mayourneen, 
And don't look so forlorn, 
We soon will meet again, love, 
When these gloomy days are gone. 
TEDI.,f.—I 
wouldn't leave ould Ire-and, 
But times are bad, you know; 
So to the land of plenty, 
My da.rlin.t, I 
must go. 
I 
bundled up my kit, 
Oh, Biddy, don't you cry; 
The vessel soon will bear me on 
With many a 
weary sigh. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
[Same as before.] 
TEDDY.— When I 
arrive, my darlint, 
There'll be joy within my soul, 
I'll work and save my money, 
And send you, love, the whole. 
The maidens may be fair; 
But, Biddy, never fear— 
The last words that you say will still 
Be ringing in my ears. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and .TEDDY.

GOOD-BYE, 
BIDDY DEAR.—{CONTINUED.] 
TEDDY. — Now I 
must say good-bye to you, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
The ship will soon be sailing 
Far out from Dublin Bay. 
But, Biddy, soon expect me, 
We'll marry by-and-bye; 
Oh, when you are for ever mine, 
No more I'll weep and sigh. 
CHORUS—BIDDY and TEDDY. 
[Same as before.] 
[They embrace, and TEDDY departs, leaving BIDDY looking 
sorrowfully after him.]

SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by CHAS. M AC EVOY. 
I'm the rollicking Irish Barney, 
I 
delight to dance and sing, 
I'm Ind of the divil and blarney, 
And all of that sort of thing. 
Just watch my graceful motions, 
As I 
move upon the floor, 
limy foot but took a 
notion, 
It would never stop I'm sure. 
R-o-1-1-1-c-k-i-n—g B-a- r-n-e-y, 
Am I 
not full of the blarney, 
Just watch my foot astore, 
Its motion is so sure, 
Tbe ladles' eyes they follow mine as 1 
trip about the floor. 
(Dance.) 
(Repeat the ladies' eyes, dTc.) 
I 
have traveled this country over, 
And to stop I 
don't know how, 
For I 
always must keep moving, 
The same as yo.i see tne now. 
But somehow or another, 
The p 
ople all agree 
When I 
sing and dance it pleases them, 
And of course it pleases me.

MR. CALLNEY FROM THE LAKESIDE. 
Originally sung with success by C. P. HYLAND. 
W HEN I 
left dear old Ireland, 
On a 
bright sunny morn, 
And parted there on dry land, 
The place where I 
was born; 
I 
landed here in the middle of the year, 
Just off the Battery ; 
And made my trip on a 
great big ship, 
And came to America. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
come from sweet Killarney by the lakeside, 
Where the pretty little ducks and drakes ride ; 
For my name is Mr. Carney, 
From the lakes of sweet Killarney, 
In the land where the floury praties grow. 
As soon as ever I 
landed, 
My friends wanted to know 
How things were in old Ireland, 
Where the floury praties grow. 
They told me I 
was welcome, 
And took me by the hand; 
Then we danced and sung till morning light, 
In praise of Paddy's land. 
For I 
come from, etc. 
So now I'll say good evening, 
I 
can no longer stay ; 
I've done my best to please you, 
And it's time I 
was away. 
So now I 
must be leaving, 
And just before I 
go, 
We'll give three cheers for Erin, 
Where the floury praties grow, 
For I 
come from, etc.

IN 
dreams, sweet dreams I 
see again 
A 
spot so dear to me, 
Where those I 
parted from in pain 
Still linger lovingly ; 
Where oft in childhood's sunny hours 
I 
fondly lov'd to roam— 
A 
sweet green spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home; 
A sweet green spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home. 
There is no place like our native land, 
I 
care not where we stray; 
O'er mountain steep or valley deep, 
On ocean's pathless way; 
My heart yet turns with fondness back 
Across the racing foam. 
To that fair spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Trish home; 
To that fair spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home. 
One hope still lingers in my heart--
Gives zest to all my joys— 
Once more to see again the home 
Where we were girls and boys; 
A 
mother's form in age bow'd down, 
Still on the earth doth roam, 
In that green spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home; 
In that green spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home. 
" OUR IRISH BOYS." 
As sung by Seem, klz and Caoms, with great success. 
Our Boys." 
You may talk of " your boys," and your heroes of old 
By the powers, but ilie Irish can boast 
A tong list of heroes, of Erin the pride, 
We number " our " Boys by the host ; 
Saint Patrick the first on the list I 
will place, 
Then I'll name quite a 
lot great and small; 
From Brian Burn and the great Donagal, 
To O'Connell, the pride of them all. 
CII011138. 
He was one of Our Boys, he was! 
We are proud of Our Boys, we are; 
He was honest and true, so give him his due, 
He was one of 
Our Boys," hurrah! 
To speak of the year ' 98 we don't fear, 
We had many brave boys then, I 
vow, 
And in ' 48. too, we had heroes a 
few, 
With pride we remember them now; 
Robert Emmett, M'Manus, O'Brien, O'Neil, 
0 
Donavon Rossa, O'More; 
O'Connor, and Martin, and one more I'll name, 
John Mitchell, whose loss we deplore. 
He was, etc. 
Sam Lover and Moore, were Our Boys, to be sure. 
They were Irish. there's divil a 
doubt ; 
Your soldiers are Irish, wherever they show 
They soon put their foemen to rout; 
In this land of the free, where we happen to be. 
We are modest and don't make a 
noise; 
But your generals, your statestiten, and all si9lid men, 
Belong to the rants of Our Boys. 
CHORUS. 
They belong to Our Boys, they do! 
And we're proud of Our Boys, we are; 
If they're honest and true, we give them their due, 
We are proud of " Our Boys," hurrah!

OVER her knee, over her knee, _ 
How my old Grandmother used to spank me, 
Over her knee, over her knee,

It was spank! spank! spank! 
No use was it kicking, for on she went licking, 
With spank I

Over her knee, over her knee, 
Oft she would turn me, as if for a 
spree, 
Over her knee, over her knee, 
Turn me again and again; 
It was spank ! spank! spank! 
In vain was my crying, she kept applying 
The spank! spank ! spank!

terrible pain. 
Then it's over her knee, etc. 
When I 
was free—down from her knee, 
Naughty again I

Then she took me back on her knee, 
Acting the same as before ; 
It was spank! spank! spank ! 
A

Still spank! spank! spank!
