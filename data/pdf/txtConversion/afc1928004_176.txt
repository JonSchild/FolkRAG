 ANS Vanderspiittensieglemann, 
Married Betsy Yawsphitcrakenvann, 
He kept a 
Lager Bier Saloon, 
And in the band play'd the Bassoon, 
lie loved his Betz and she lov'd him, 
But Hans with jealousy grew thin, 
And asked whenever he came home, 
Oh who's been here since I've pen gone? 
CHORUS. 
Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone? 
Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone ? 
Mine Got in Hemelsplitzen vone, 
Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone? 
Hans grew quite lean, nor would allow 
A 
soul to speak mit Betz his vrow, 
Kept both eyes open night and day, 
For fear his Betz might go astray. 
• 
79 
When with his band he did parade, 
Poor Hans was dreadfully afraid, 
"Mine got I 
vish I 
hadn't come, 
Some chap sees Betz, ven I 
am gone!" 
CHORUS. 
"Oh, vy did I 
leave her all alone, 
Vy did I 
leave her all alone ? 
I 
vish I 
never out had come, 
Oh, who sees Betz vile I 
am gone?" 
The war broke out; Hans did enlist, 
And took a 
musket in his fist; 
Bid Betz good-bye and as he press'd 
Her plump, round form unto his breast, 
lie kissed her lips, so warm and red, 
And solemnly, to her, he said; 
"Yen I 
am gone, now, Betz, my tear, 
I 
vants no udder fellers here!" 
Cnoars. 
. " Not von comes here ven I 
am gone. 
Not von comes here ven I 
am gone! 
SO 
Keep all you got for me alone. 
Let no one in vile I 
am gone!" 
Betz promised all, anti swore she'd be 
A 
pattern of fidelity, 
Hans marched away with sinking heart, 
And Betz cried loud when she saw him start. 
"Good-py, dear Hans !" My Betz, good-py, 
I'll come pack soon if I 
don't die, 
And kill any chap sure as he's porn' 
Who goes mit you vile I 
am gone!" 
Cum:us. 
" 
Oh, keep avay, vie I 
am gone! 
Oh, keep avay, vile I 
am gone! 
Oh, splutter gutter splitzer vone! 
Don't touch my Betz vile I 
am gone!" 
Hans fought mit Siegel, side by side, 
But never once forgot his bride, 
But even in the bloodiest fight, 
Ile wonder'd if all things went right. 
Si 
If Betz was true, if she went out, 
With any other chap about, 
" 
Mine got," thought Hans, " vot should I 
done, 
If some chap goes there vile I 
am gone!" 
CHORUS. 
"Oh, who goes there vile I 
am gone, 
Oh, who goes there vile I 
am gone, 
Ten tousand teufils ich von done! 
Who comforts Betz vile I 
am gone!" 
For two long years Hans stay'd avay, 
And wrote his wife each New Year's day, 
And when the end of his time had come, 
Brave Hans, discharged, put straight Icy: home, 
Ile thought of Betz, " mien got," said le— 
" 
Vot a 
good time I 
will have mit she, 
I'll pay her for staying all alone, 
If no chap's been dere since I've pen gone! 
CHORUS. 
"Oh, vots she done since I've pen gone! 
Oh, vots she done since I've pen gone! 
S2 
Has any one kept my place warm ! 
Oh, who's been here I've ben gone! 
Hans landed safe, and started soon, 
For his little lager bier saloon, 
And marching in, he looked around, 
But no where Betz was to be found. 
Into the bedroom there he went, 
On finding Betsy still intent, 
" 
Betz ! Betz !" he cried, "oh come here quick 
If I 
vait much longer I'll be sick!" 
CHORUS. 
"Vere is my Betz, vere is she gone ? 
l'ere is my Betz, vere is she gone ? 
Mein Gott in Memel vere is she? 
Not to be here to welcome me !" 
With tearful eyes, Hans gazed around, 
lie something saw upon the ground, 
Which made him open wide his eyes, 
And fined him with a 
sad surprise. 
• 
83 
There, at his feet, a 
cradle stood, 
And a 
baby in it of flesh and blood, 
It was gumming it on a 
pretzel hard as stone, 
Oh, who's been here since I've been gone. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone, 
Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone! 
Who's baby's dish and vere's Betz gone! 
Oh, who's been, here since I've pen gone?" 
Here Betz came in, "Mien Gott !" says he! 
"Nry here is Hans !" says Betz, says she, 
"Oh Betz," he cried, vot have you done? 
Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone ? 
" 
Dere's none been here," says Bet; "you know 
You wrote to me, dear Hans, and so 
I 
slept mit de letter, instead o' you, 
Und der papy come, I 
tells you true !" 
CHORUS. 
"Nien! who's been since I've pen gone? 
Nien who's been since I've pen gone ? 
84 
You can't fool me mit your letter none, 
Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone ?" 
" 
De letter make a 
baby ! Hans he cried, 
" 
Oh Betz, for you know you've lied !" 
Who is the feller dish has done ?.] 
Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone?" 
Poor Betz, she smiled and looked so plump, 
Hans couldn't wait so made a 
jump, 
And caught in his arms and kissed her well, 
Forgiving all that had befell. 
CHORUS. 
"Oh, who's been here since I've pen gone? 
Who was it kept my place so warm ? 
Betz, never mind about the letter, , 
Now I've come back, tings will go better.

4 KNOW something which I

mind telling you, 
But keep it a 
secret, now mind, 
Recourse off my 
wife was to find it out, too, 
I 
know that mit rage she'd go blind. 
It's about a young girl what I 
meet 
th'other day, 
While walking along in the street— 
And I 
know off this young girl know'd 
I 
had a 
wife 
She wouldn't think I 
was so sweet. 
cnonts. 
Now you know what I 
know, and what 
my wife don't know, 
She don't know what I 
know, and what I 
know you know, 
If you tell her what you know, and also 
what I 
know, 
Then she'd know what I 
know, what 
you know also. 
97 
I 
know that this young girl wore lots of 
false hair, 
I 
could see dat at once at a 
glance, 
I 
know that her feet were much larger 
than mine, 
I 
found. dat out when we did dance. 
She got beauty spots all over her face, 
I 
don't want to make fun at all, 
She'd a 
mole on her cheek as red as a 
beet, 
And it look'd like a 
big cod-fish ball. 
Now you know what I 
know, ,_%0 
• 
This girl's hair was red or a 
strawberry 
blonde, 
Her eyebrows hung down to her nose; 
She'd a mouth dat when open looked 
like a 
mouse trap, 
It worked on a 
spring I 
suppose. 
But still she's a 
beauty longside of my 
wife, 
To-morrow I 
get a 
divorce— 
And the secret is—well, I 
don't mind 
telling you— 
I 
marry this young girl, of course. 
Now you know what I 
know, Szic.

Her nose vas as red as a

Vaiting for an eight cent pie.

That's where You Make the 
Mistake. 
As Sung by Gus Williams. 
OME folks think they're awfully 
clever, 
That all other folks are but fools, 
Some people will often endeavor, 
To make other people their tools. 
Some people will boast of their kno w-
ledge, 
And fancy they're well wide awake. 
That none are so deep or so cute as 
0 themselves. 
That's where they make the mistake. 
CHORUS. 
There's just as good fish in the sea 
bear in mind, 
As those we have managed to take, 
So don't be too proud, and don.'i 
crow too loud, 
For that's where you make the mis. 
take. 
138 
Don't imagine you'll meet a 
policeman, 
Whenever there's a 
row in the street, 
Don't imagine you'll find a 
fishmonger 
Declare that his fish are not sweet; 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
hack-
man, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl 
up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be what some folks call t, 
cake, 
You may as well think that a 
bed-lyg 
won't bite, 
And that's where you make the mis-
take. 
There's just as good fish, etc. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in 
purse, 
Because he is not dressed as a 
swell, 
139 
A 
book with a 
cover that's olden and 
worn, 
has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar and 
cuffs 
To his finger tips white as snow flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you'll make the mistake, 
The ladies still wear an abundence of 
hair, 
'Tis a 
wonder their dear necks don't 
break, 
But if you imagine they grow it them. 
selves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting don't write spoon ey 
letters 
To your fair one, for love, nor for 
sport, 
For should you break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court 
When you wed, do not marry the faraly 
as well 
For that will not a 
paradise make, 
Above all close the door to your mother. 
Or, that's where you'll make the mis-
take, 
nut, talking of marriage reminds me, 
That my girl has given me the shake, 
he thought I 
would buy a 
ring and 
gold watch, 
And that's where she made the mis. 
take. 
There's just as good fish. etc. 
Don't imagine a 
bed-bug's a 
lobster, 
Or an elephant small as a 
flea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
14-1 
Don't 
reckon your chickens 
before 
they're hatched, 
Or your duck it may turn out a 
drake, 
Don't go and. eat mustard and. think 
it's preserves, 
Or that's where you'll make the mis-
take. 
With all the advice I 
have given, 
You ought to be well wide awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any 
more, 
That's where you make the mid ;la 
There's just as good fish, etc.

OLD RATS AND RAGS.

LINGARD. 
Old hats ! old rags I 
my trouble is great, 
Could I 
be in a 
more wretched state, 
I 
feel indeed my heart it will break ; 
List, and I 
will tell you my wrongs, 
hark, and I 
will my woes unfold ; 
By a 
girl I 
have been cruelly sold, 
And through her I've lost all my nice gold, 
My heart and my gold are both gone. 
CHORUS. 
Old hats, old rags, my cry is old rags; 
This bag on my back, the streets I 
drag, 
And Ruth, mine Ruth, I (lid love her so, 
But Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
She lived down an area in Union Square, 
And every day I 
did pass me by there; 
She was possess'd of beauty most rare, 
And one day she beckoned me to come, 
She had some old bats to exchange for new 
She melted the heart of this poor Jew; 
And how I 
loved her I 
A 
h, just a 
few, 
ziut Slotchzein, I 
find I've been sold. 
Old hats, old rags, etc. 
I 
used to call on her most every day, 
Down on my knees I 
implored her to say 
She'd be my dear wife, and not to say nay, 
Ane. then she agreed to be mine ; 
Litt oh my heart, I 
must have been cream, 
For in my old coat I 
opened a 
seam, 
And gave ten dollars to my heart's queen, 
To buy her some things for the time. 
Old hats, old rags, etc, 
She said, now, dear Slotchzein, soon you'll be mine, 
Drink my good health in a 
glass of old wine. 
It must have been poisoned, for I 
slept such a 
time, 
Which she turned to profit it seems ; 
For when I 
awoke, I 
thought I 
must choke, 
I 
was tied by the arms and legs with a 
rope, 
And Ruth had hooked it with mine coat, 
With a 
thousand dollars sewed in the seam. 
Old hats, old rags, etc.

,NE day I

state, 
When you've heard my sad tale von will 
pity my fate; 
My wife makes me work both morning and night, 
And she swears that I

The first night we were married, it's the truth I

My wife went to bed and I

And since I've been married, I 
must do what 
can, 
to pity the fate of a 
poor married man.

She makes me get up and set light to the fire, 
Six months I've been married, it's the truth I

Before we were married, its true on my word,

A
ll sing you of a 
red-head gal, 
That lived in this here town, 
The boys they called her nobby Sal; 
She was known for miles around, 
ner eyes were brig,ht,her teeth were white, 
her hands were just the same; 
She was often seen out late at night, 
For she had lager on the brain. 
Cuorms— Lager Beer Sally was ker name, 
Lager Beer Sally was her name, 
She was handsome she was fair, 
But she liked her good old beer. 
Red-head Sally was her name, 
Red- head Sally was her name, 
She was always kicking up a 
row down .uere, 
And she was always ready for her beer. 
One evening she was out quite late, 
When she met with a 
gay young man; 
One glance from her eye did seal his fate, 
Her smiles he could not withstand, 
By her request they started off, 
lie with love was quite insane, 
And she was bound to enjoy the sport, 
For she had lager on the brain. 
They drank to access and both got tight, 
A had fix she was in, 
This gay young sport began to fight, 
When two police rushed in. 
This horrible sight we must deplore 
They were dragged to jail quite near, 
Where she is doing six months or more, 
Without her lager beer.

Lager Beer Sally was Her Name.

What happened to me here one day;

And I

But my lager run out, and my Switzer-kase, too, 
And I 
found out when it has been too late, 
Of you want to make money in this kind of business 
By dam, you must not keep a 
slate. 
My friend, Gasper Huntz, he called on me one day, 
And asked me for em n 
glass of bier; 
He drink that and said it was bully, a 
nuddcr, 
And then rubs his belly right here. 
He called for more lager' and Switzer-kase, too, 
And then he said that was first-rate ; 
When I 
ask him for pay, he did so mit his eye, 
And told me to put that on the slate. 
Now I 
don' t 
like that business, and so I 
was told him 
One day when he come mit my store ; 
And there I 
saw Gasper a 
drinking mine lager, 
And huggin' my wife mit the door. 
I 
take him shust so, mit the slack of his breeches, 
And pitch him right out on his head. 
I 
take down that slate and I 
break up that busiaess, 
.-',.-nd den, potz tausend, I 
was mad.

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age: 
•••  
HUMPTYDUREPTY! 
IT PLEASES OLD AND YOUNG. 
With directions so plain that, any person 
can become an adept. 
Read what a 
Leading Journal says of it: 
“An ingenious little book of the thaum a-
turgie order has been sent us, called"HumpTy 
DIIMPTY," and bound in such a 
way as to give 
opportunity for a 
decided puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appearance of a 
child's picture book, gayly printed and col-
ored, it is so bound that a 
practised manipu— 
lator taking it up and flirting the leaves rap-
idly over, can make it appear to be filled with 
copies of only one picture, or with blank pages 
or with any one of quite a 
succession of fig-
ures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly 
thumbed. appears to contain nothing but por-
traits of Harlequin in his tesselated suit; the 
next, only Columbine; then, uothingbut Pan-
taloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistopheles. 
A 
little practice and the directions printed 
-with the book will make anybody at home in 
the handling of it."—Philad. Evening Bulletin.
