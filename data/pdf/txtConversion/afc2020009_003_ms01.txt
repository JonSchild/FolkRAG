DOUGLAS RILEY, Eyeglass Repairs 
Katy Clune  00:00   
So this is KC and JG interviewing Doug Riley on—we said it was September 23, 2020—in downtown 
Durham. And Mr. Riley, why don't you start by just introducing yourself for the tape and then we'll see 
where it goes? 
 
Douglas Riley  00:02 
I'm Douglas Riley, Eyeglass Repairs, in Durham, North Carolina. The closest one to me that does what I 
do is two hours away. In Winston Salem. I started in optics in 1976. Graduated from Durham Tech in 
optics 1978. I had Roxboro's only privately owned optical shop from '79 to '89. Closed up, and in 1996 
started Eyeglass Repairs in Durham, North Carolina.  
 
DR  00:31 
What I have here is a, well in our vernacular, is called a semi-rimless pair of glasses that is broken in the 
bridge. The bridge is titanium. The part that holds the lenses—this is called the eye wire-is not titanium. 
I'm going to take out the part I cannot repair and x in a new part called a bridge. [pause] 
 
KC  01:52 
So you said you studied optics at Durham Tech?  
 
DR  01:55 
Correct. 
 
KC  01:57 
How did you settle on that? 
 
DR  02:00 
It was the only program, that once you completed it, you didn't have to work for someone else. I worked 
for my older brother selling ultrapure water equipment in New England. I was up there as a 
commissioned salesman. When we moved back down here the other investors and my brother put me on 
a salary. My time wasn't my own. [clears throat] It didn't work. So. I had to choose something else to do.

KC  02:41 
Is your family from the Durham area? 
 
DR  02:45 
We started in Hampton, Virginia. Our father, and his older brother, were two of the original electro arc 
welders. They invented welding equipment for the Newport News shipyard. 
 
KC  03:03 
Wow. So you were exposed to being handy. 
 
DR  03:11 
I was raised on a farm. I was born in 1939. When you were a kid on a farm, you wanted a toy, right? 
There's some wood, there's some screws, there's some nails, there's something. My father made my first 
scooter—a skateboard with a handle—that had large wheels on it, large diameter wheels, that he got out 
of the shipyard and yeah, you could go through the field and what have you. 
 
KC  04:05 
I bet other kids were jealous of that scooter. 
 
DR  04:09 
[Says “Thank you for opening the door.” to someone in the lobby.] All right. The first thing we're gonna 
do is we're going to measure the bridge. And he requires an 18 bridge. [Pause] 
 
DR  04:32 
We go to the drawer and get us a new bridge— 
 
KC  04:48 
Are those things that you fabricate, the bridges, or— 
 
DR  04:50 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
3 
And this is what this is what is known as a bridge. It connects the two eye wires. 
 
KC  05:03 
Do you purchase those or do you fabricate the bridges? 
 
DR  05:06 
No. I hate to say, they come from a country that put out the miserable virus. [China] 
 
KC  05:28 
Does Durham Tech still have an optics program? 
 
DR  05:33 
Yes. It is very poorly marketed and it is largely online. How would you like to go to a surgeon that 
lived—that learned brain surgery by computer? You don't learn a on hands, [pause], profession by a 
bloody computer. And when I started in the 70s opticianry was a profession. When someone couldn't see 
out of a pair of glasses, it was your responsibility to deduce why couldn't they see out of a pair of 
glasses. You had the ability to, you had the equipment.  
 
DR  06:50 
Today, opticians do nothing more than type in an order. "I can't see out of these glasses." "Hey, don't 
bug me go see the doctor somewhere." Optics is the strangest profession because it is the only place on 
earth you will find where two is not equal to two. Okay?  
 
DR  07:25 
There is a piece of machinery called a lensometer. You have a lens that is shaped like this, the poor 
dumb machine will tell you, "This is a 'plus two,' 'minus two,' a 'plus two' or a 'minus two'—that doesn't 
matter. Pick one or the other. You have another lens that is shaped like this that is the identical 
prescription. The point of clearest vision in the lens, the optical center, is directly over the pupil in both 
lenses. But in one pair, people can see, and in another pair, people cannot see. It is done every 30 
seconds in this country. People give people money and it is stolen legally. 
 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
4 
KC  08:33 
And its because of the machine's incapability to measure—? 
 
DR  08:39 
It is because the intrinsic values that go to make up this 'plus two' or 'minus two.' For instance, this could 
be a 'plus four' front curve and a 'minus two' back curve that would be a 'plus two' right?  Over here, you 
have a, what, plus—a 'plus three' and a 'minus one.' Would be 'plus two.' Okay the intrinsic values that 
go to make up that 'plus two' is totally different. Right. [returns to working on glasses] 
 
DR  09:35 
So, the heat from the soldering, the silver solder is, the melting point of the silver solder as 1,300, 1,400 
degrees. The heat, to prevent the heat, from traveling down the metal and burning off more of the finish 
than you want burned off. You use volcanic lava pumice. [How you doing? Customer 1: All right. You, 
you will have to suffer through our class in optics. Crosstalk, laughter] 
 
Julia Gartrell  10:33 
And you're wrapping that pumice around anything that you don't want to heat up? 
 
DR  10:43 
Correct. 
 
JG  10:44 
It's completely pliable? 
 
DR  10:47 
Yes. It is dirty, a dirty clay that I turn over. Yes. Yes. Okay. If 
 
JG  11:12 
Your soldering iron is is gas powered? 
 
DR  11:16 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
5 
Propane. The first the first thing you want to do is to remove the parts that you cannot deal with. So it's 
 
JG  11:46 
So its interesting your family has industry in welding because this is welding on a very miniature scale. 
 
DR  11:52 
[Can hear the noises of him working on the glasses.] I just didn't end up with the brains that my, my 
family—the ability to be able to make a lot of money and. . .Okay, what did I do with it.  
 
KC  12:30 
How long have you been in this location? 
 
DR  12:33 
24 years. I opened up September 1996. 
 
KC  12:43 
So you've seen quite an incredible change in the field, since when you started. 
 
DR  12:52 
In opticianry? Yes, it's gone from being a profession to just somebody that sits at a computer and orders 
stuff. Like I say, the closest one to me that does this is in Winston Salem. 
 
KC  13:18 
Right. How has the—[phone rings]. Do you want to get that, or? 
 
DR  13:25 
(On phone) Yes. Hi. May I help you? Yes. Hi. Yes. 
 
KC  13:54 
So how has the—? 
 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
6 
DR  13:55 
(On phone) Yes, I do. I do the work for you while you wait. Only on a limited time. I have to go, I have 
evidently developed a nervous condition. I've got a doctor's appointment that I have to go to. I've got to 
leave at 1:30. So it's better for you to come. Really now or tomorrow. Right. Right. Very good. Oh, in the 
center of downtown Durham, when you come down at 85, you come down at five and you go around the 
curve to your right. And this, 70 comes in from your left, and just at you, you cross over the top of a hill 
and you should go down that hill. There's an exit, 15 501 South and it curls back under 85 and goes up a 
hill in front of the Scientology Church and connects you with Mangum Street. Come down Mangum 
Street, and you come down Mangum Street if you turn right on Parish and come down Parish, you will 
hit the front door. Parish will dead end at the front door. Yes. The name of the building is the Bull City 
Business Center. Great. Figure, traffic,45 minutes or so. Yep, thanks. Bye. [hangs up] 
 
KC  17:09 
So you were, you've there's been sort of a landslide change in how glasses are prescribed and made, but 
how has the how has actually fixing them changed since you got your start? 
 
DR  17:25 
The machinery has become a whole lot more sophisticated. We'll use, well, even then some of the 
equipment was used by jewelers. But the equipment has gotten a whole lot more sophisticated, a whole 
lot better. You do not damage the frame and you end up with a better cosmetic result. 
 
KC  17:57 
And so when you say there's the closest person to you that can do this type of work is two hours away, 
what do you mean specifically by that? Like soldiering the frames and anything beyond (sort of like, the 
stretching), that isn't available at glasses shops? 
 
DR  18:21 
Everything you see me do here, no one else is able to do. And because there's not a whole lot of money 
it, it is an old person's profession. I tried to give this to our daughter and grandson, and they would have 
none of it. Because there's no corporate insurance.  
 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
7 
DR  19:00 
Alright, [returns to working on glasses] so let me get going with this. You want to block the heat. . . 
 
[19:08-19:41, small talk with customer]  
 
DR  19:42 
The white stuff you see me use is a flux. A professor from Duke educated me on a flux. The flux is, in 
theory, a slight acid solution that helps stick the silver solder to the parts. I guarantee my work to stay 
together largely because no one else in optics, anymore, guarantees that you will [pause] be able to see 
out of the glasses they give you, or— 
 
DR  21:13 
40 years ago we had this huge cabinet with all these little drawers and when you bought glasses, you 
bought some to display, and then you bought a massive supply. So that when somebody came in, "Well, 
your bridge broke." So you went to this cabinet with all these tiny little drawers. And here's the front of 
this particular frame and you would box this up, send it back to the supplier, the supplier would send 
you a new front. That was bad for the, uh—that was bad for profits. 
 
KC  22:04 
The glasses are designed less to be repaired, nowadays? 
 
DR  22:12 
Correct. 
 
KC  22:14 
How often do something someone bring something to you? And you say you can't? Can't help them out 
with it? And like, what is that? 
 
DR  22:25 
Fairly rarely. 
 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
8 
KC  22:29 
And what would be an example of a 'lost cause' pair of glasses? 
 
DR  22:37 
If it was titanium, totally titanium. 
 
JG  22:47 
Because you can't solder. . .? 
 
DR  22:50 
Now. Machinery like this that you see me hold. The machinery, the whole stuff together is called a jig. 
J-I-G, right? Because I'm Irish, this is an Irish gig. [laughs] 
 
KC  23:12 
You have quite a custom workbench. 
 
DR  23:18 
I made it. I didn't make it. I made it, in so far as, when you bought one of these things, you got two 
alligator clips. I wanted four. So I had to buy two, to make four alligator clips. 
 
KC  23:45 
And what is that, table legs? For your lights? 
 
DR  23:51 
This? [Katy: "Yeah.] Home Depot said this wouldn't work. [laughter]  
 
DR  24:01 
I didn't want this cord to just simply hang down behind this, like this. And so I thought it would be 
artistic—you wave it through here, right? So I weave it through, I cut the, I splice the ends, I put the 
plug on, plug in, plug it in—and, "Oh, you dummy." There's no off and  on switch. So this was a nice 
spot for the off and on switch to go. [laughter.] 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell

Customer 1  24:44 
The mother of necessity. 
 
KC  24:51 
How do you teach yourself new skills—or do you need to—as the industry changes? 
 
DR  25:07 
I don't quite understand the question. You'll have to monitor, you'll have to cut out this part of the tape. 
Say the question again? 
 
JG  25:25 
I guess she's asking if, like as the technology of the glasses has changed, so you know thinking about 
like acrylic frames, and the titanium . . . How have you, over the years, learned to mend them in new 
ways? If there's not a lot of people in your field. Are you kind of trial and error. . .? 
 
DR  25:47 
Glasses are glasses. It's not that complicated an operation. It's, it's very simple. I have pictures on my 
phone of different interesting things I can show you and you may be able to transfer it off of my phone 
to you— 
 
KC  26:24 
So you don't often get stumped. 
 
DR  26:28 
You are only limited by your imagination. 
 
KC  26:36 
Do you have a whole lot of regulars? 
 
DR  26:48 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
10 
Yes and no. I have friends that save glasses that people dispose of for me. And I have come across 
frames where people have thrown away what I have repaired and it hurts because my repair should be as 
good as if not better than new. And in colonial times, people reused stuff. They [stammers] made stuff. 
[pause] 
 
DR  28:13 
Which carrier? [to the customer sitting in his shop, referring to his hat with a military insignia on it] 
 
Customer 1  28:17 
This is one off of the [ship name, unclear]. Aircraft carrier. 
 
DR  28:21 
Were you on the [ship name]? 
 
Customer 1  28:22 
No, my son was. 
 
DR  28:27 
Most all of the carriers today come out of Newport News. 
 
KC  28:36 
Did you serve, Mr. Riley?  
 
DR  28:38 
I'm sorry? 
 
KC  28:38 
Did you serve? 
 
DR  28:40 
I was in the army. I graduated from Huntsville, Alabama, in missiles. I was an ordnance there. 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
11 
 
KC  28:55 
Was that before Durham Tech, or afterwards? 
 
DR  29:00 
Oh, a hundred years ago, a different lifetime. Like 50s, early 60s. 
 
Customer 1  29:08 
You got in on part of Vietnam, didn't you? 
 
DR  29:10 
No. No The recruiter came to me when I got out and said we want you to re-up to go to Rucker and learn 
to fly helicopters. But I had met this young lady. I didn't go to Vietnam fly [laughs]. 
 
Customer 1  29:43 
Probably a good thing. I was Air Force. But all my youngins they went Navy. And I was telling these 
girls, one of my sons went into the submarine service. And I just couldn't handle that. I don't want to be 
on nothing that sinks on purpose. 
 
DR  30:08 
I worked for my older brother in manufacturing ultrapure water equipment. And part of it is using anion 
and cation resins. And you separate the anion and cation resins by up flowing. You dump them into a, 
about a 14 foot tall cylinder, a 15 foot. And none of the other guys—the cylinder was just big enough 
that I could get into it like this. And they would shove me, and my, the tools that I would use ahead of 
me, and I would go in like this and go down to the bottom.  
 
DR  30:31 
At Huntsville, a group, I got in a with a group of GIs that said they were going spelunking. I said, "What 
is spelunking?" "Caving." "Oh, well that's neat."  
 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
12 
[30:32-36:54, Doug tells a story about spelunking, finishes the first customer’s pair and returns them. 
Accepts new customer's glasses, realizes the glasses are only missing a screw.]  
 
DR  36:54 
Heavens, sorry have made you wait. If I had known this was—I would have fixed this for you and had 
you on your way. I apologize. [Customer 2 thanks him, laughter.] 
 
KC  37:15 
So they were just missing a screw? 
 
DR  37:17 
No, the screw evidently, got unscrewed—or. . . Heavens. Now I'm gonna have to go home and take a 
nap. Oh, this is so difficult. 
 
DR  37:44 
This is so exhausting. Your, the nose pads are non-existent. [Customer murmering.] Glasses are held on 
the bridge of the nose with something called pads and guard arms. The little metal wire is called a guard 
arm and the piece of plastic that goes against your skin is called a nose pad.  
 
DR  39:08 
I will say these things are probably, fairly loose on you right? [Customer agrees.] Now ladies, you 
disappoint me.  
 
KC  39:31 
Why is that?  
 
DR  39:35 
How could I look at these glasses and look at him and know they've been loose? [Customer, Katy 
murmoring.]  
 
JG  39:48 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
13 
How did you know? 
 
DR  39:53 
Because I started dealing with glasses in January of 1976. 
 
KC  40:04 
[Quiet talking.] 
 
DR  40:12 
I have a gift. Here you go.  
 
[40:18-41:38, returns glasses to customer, charges $16.50, returns to interview.]  
 
DR  41:39 
The glasses, when they were sitting up here, were like this. Okay? All you have to do is to look across at 
the person and see that his head isn't like this. 
 
JG  42:05 
Okay, so that's been buzzing in there for 10 minutes. What is that? 
 
DR  42:09 
Jewelry cleaner. It jiggles off the crystallized flux and some of the dirt. 
 
DR  42:26 
These are semi rimless glasses. There's two parts to this. [showing a piece of what looks like nylon 
fishing line.] One part runs around the top and holds the lens in. And there's another part that runs 
around the bottom of the lens. The lens has a groove that runs around it. 
 
DR  42:52 
There's two types of people. There's nearsighted people—sighted in the near—and far sighted people, 
cited in the far. They can't see close up. So you have, right here, a near sighted person and a farsighted 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
14 
person. How do you know which lens is which? It's the shell game. [He is asking how do you know 
which lens goes into which side of the frame.] 
 
JG  43:32 
It has to fit in the shape of the glasses, right? 
 
DR  43:35 
Not necessarily. Near sighted people—the thickness on the lens on the temporal side is always thicker. 
This could be nothing other than the right lens. This could be nothing other than the left lens. 
 
KC  43:59 
And for farsighted people? 
 
DR  44:06 
The shape, generally, yeah. Or if they have an invisible bifocal. You go by the bifocal. I had laid these 
down here so that I knew which one was which. [turns on machine that sounds like a dental drill.] 
 
DR  44:50 
It's polishing off some of the burned area. It's making it a little bit more neat. 
 
KC  45:11 
[Asks a question or makes a comment that is unintelligible.] 
 
DR  45:25 
[phone rings, answers phone.] Yes. Hi. May I help you? Right? Yes, I'm here. Monday, Monday, 
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Correct. Saturday 11 to one. I'm repairing someone's glasses 
right now, while I talk to you. Sorry for the noise. [drill contines] I'm in the center. I'm in the center of 
downtown Durham. Downtown, there is a plaza with a statue of a bull. That is right at the front door. 
Great. Look forward to seeing you. Right. Good. Go ahead that ask your question. Great. Yeah. That 
works. You Appreciate it. Thank you. 
 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
15 
KC  47:27 
You're good at multi-tasking. Will you tell us about this custom tool?  
 
DR  47:45 
One half of my mother's sewing scissors. 
 
KC  47:49 
Aw. 
 
DR  47:56 
I use it to—See those two little holes right there? There's a piece of line that runs through it. 
 
KC  48:07 
Yes. 
 
DR  48:08 
I use it to fish that out.  
 
JG  48:22 
When did you end up turning those scissors into the tool? When did you realize you had a need for it? 
 
DR  48:29 
When I opened up 24 years ago. 
 
JG  48:36 
So you said your daughter has no interest in taking over the business? 
 
DR  48:42 
Because there was no corporate corporate insurance policy. 
 
JG  48:47 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
16 
Is there anyone that you've taken on as an apprentice or that has shown interest in taking it over? 
 
DR  48:53 
No. Because—and the trouble of it is—it isn't nice to talk in front of you. But if I sell you a pair of 
glasses, I only make 200% 300% maybe four, maybe 400%. Okay. If I repair your eyeglasses, the 
percent of profit becomes obscene because the materials used cost next to nothing. Sorry. [laughs] 
 
DR  49:43 
You pay me for artisanship. 
 
KC  49:52 
And I see you might also be a painter? 
 
DR  49:56 
Oh heck. No. 
 
KC  50:01 
What other, sort of creative things, do you get into? 
 
DR  50:10 
I repair eyeglasses. 
 
KC  50:11 
And. . . ? 
 
DR  50:14 
I repair eyeglasses. 
 
KC  50:17 
So there's just a painting on a canvas in your studio that plopped down from...? 
 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
17 
DR  50:26 
I have a terribly difficult time booting myself in the rear end and trying to paint. I want to. I have 
examples of pictures that I want to try to copy. 
 
DR  50:53 
One of my older brothers that I worked for made a mosaic. He worked 18 years on it. It would sit down 
in the basement and collect dust. And Chuck would go down and  use a paintbrush and brush off the 
dust and make some, chip some, Italian pieces of glass and glue them to this three-quarter-inch plywood 
board. It was about three feet square. It was a picture of a very famous, Egyptian picture, of a king 
setting on a throne. And there's a queen doing . . . [stammmers] What is this called, something or other?  
 
DR  52:15 
The queen is in front of him. On the wall here is the sun with rays coming down. So this tiny little chips 
of glass glued for it to make each ray. Right? And the sun. And the other wall dressings, Egyptian wall 
dressings, different things behind the Queen here, and the Queen is—and the king is—in profile. And 
the queen is in profile. And he used pieces of brick that he thinned to four, five millimeters thick for the 
brown human, hands, face where have you. And he incorporated "CD Reilly" [his signature, unsure of 
initials] in the chips. It's very hard to find. He worked 18 years on that. 
 
Customer 1  53:36 
Takes a lot of patience. 
 
DR  53:39 
He was, he was a tremendous inventor. My brother in the 60s came here to talk to the investors. And 
what he really wanted to do was to start a bottled water company. And these two wealthy doctors looked 
at us and said, "Water comes out of a tap. Who's gonna buy bottled water?" 
 
Customer 1  54:23 
Everybody now. 
 
DR  54:25 
 
afc2020009_003—Douglas Riley interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell 
18 
Nobody buys bottled water. And my nephews have said, "Can you imagine how wealthy our family 
would be? If dad had been able to start the bottled water company." 
 
JG  54:49 
But that's going against your constitution of, the environmentalism of the glasses in a way. Where you're 
saying you appreciate the repair, because certain people are not tossing glasses in the trash right? And a 
bottled water company. . . phew, that's a lot of plastic. 
 
DR  55:18 
I am too mercenary. I don't look at stuff like that. 
 
JG  55:28 
That's fair. Yeah. 
 
DR  55:28 
To be an environmentalist, you have to ignore the fact that there is a God. And there is a God that is 
going to take care of you. And that there is a God that is never going to allow you to run out of water 
or—Provide for you. That's not to say that he is going to stop someone coming in with a gun and 
shooting you. Because for whatever strange reason, God allowed evil into the world.  
 
DR  56:29 
And I think that when we return to God, I think questions constitute evil. And I think when we die, death 
is a filter. And what is the godly part of us? The breath, the breath of God returns. And our earthly part 
stays here to decay. And I think the breath of God, I think—questions constitute evil. And I think, "Oh, 
well, I'm going to ask God. Why? Why did you allow Auschwitz? Why did you allow the Germans to do 
this?" There was always more Jews than there was Germans! Why didn't one of them say, "Hey, look, 
some of us are gonna die, but some of us got to live. Let's get the devil out of here. But I'm not getting 
on your boxcar. We'll settle it right here right now."

That's why I don't wear a mask. I look at being forced to wear a mask as, "Get into my boxcar. And I'm 
not getting in your boxcar. I'm sorry. Let someone in please [referring to lobby door.] Thank you. Oh, 
sorry. Oh, I keep me on track. Keep me on track.  
 
KC  58:37 
Looks like you may have another customer. 
 
DR  58:39 
I digress. Yeah. Hi, ma'am. Yeah, I have a seat please. I will shut up and work. [small talk to explain 
interview.]  
 
DR  59:07 
This is a special secret optical line. I can tell you about it but then I'd have to kill you. [laughter] 
Otherwise known as 30 pound cast.  
 
[59:21-1:04:13, demonstrating how to secure frames of rimless glasses with fishing line.] 
 
KC  1:04:14 
Mr. Riley, if you had someone here, if you were talking to a young person who was interested in getting 
into this field, what would you tell them? 
 
DR  1:04:34 
You have to have been—I wanted to be a surgeon. There is no, there's no greater adrenaline rush than 
being in surgery. I worked for a surgeon. I was good enough to become a lab and x-ray technician. I 
couldn't get any farther.  
 
DR  1:05:06 
And when my brother and the other investors put me out of the company, and I had to choose a 
profession to go into, I didn't want to be a inhalation therapist, because I'd have to work at Duke or work 
at—[cuts off, returns to working on the pair of glasses, demonstrating.]

KC  1:06:41 
So you would recommend this for someone who wants to be their own boss? 
 
DR  1:06:47 
This is most satisfying. You make people happy. People come in with stuff. I wish you could have seen 
the pair of glasses the other day that had been run over with a car.  
 
[1:07:08-1:09:19, small talk with new customer who came into space.]  
 
KC  1:09:19 
Have you been interviewed before about your work history, or practice? 
 
DR  1:09:32 
Only in so far as, years ago, in the 80s, I was interviewed by the FBI to get a junior private detectives 
license. I worked for a detective here in town. And chased errant husbands around North and South 
Carolina. 
 
KC  1:10:06 
Was that in between glasses repairs? 
 
DR  1:10:09 
No, this was when I owned my own optical shop up in Roxboro. 
 
KC  1:10:17 
Did you have employees when you own that shop? 
 
DR  1:10:19 
No. [pause] I have, one time I had a young fellow work for me. And I was hoping that he would take 
this place over. But he wasn't making as much money as he wanted fast enough and packed up all his 
gear one night and left. [spray sounds] But it was clear he was more interested in selling glasses.

[1:11:45-1:13:45, finished rimless glasses repair, charges customer $31.50 for work.] 
 
DR  1:13:45 
This has to go in here. Because this hinge, pull it out, and there's a hole there right—So what you want 
to do is get. . .Oh! [finds old arm of glasses.] 
 
DR  1:14:08 
Years ago, years ago [talking to customer].  
 
DR  1:14:20 
Years ago, all plastics were made out of something called cellulose nitrate. Do those two words mean 
anything to you? [New customer in lobby, suggests cellulose nitrates means derived from plants] 
 
DR  1:14:48 
Well, cellulose nitrate, cellulose nitrate is another term for gun cotton. It is very explosive. So, here is an 
old temple, right? I will pass it under the flame. Take a picture. I will go one [puts old glasses arm into 
flame, blows it out.] Smell the camphor? [sounds of agreement.] 
 
DR  1:15:34 
You just, you just got a bit of optical history. Good. Now what was I doing? Oh, I was Yes, I was back 
over here sorry. 
 
DR  1:15:54 
You get a plastic bead and you put this plastic bead in here as filler. Now. Okay, let me stay on track 
here. Remind me to tell you about this—ask me about this thing. [points to the metal container holding 
his tools on his small table.] 
 
DR  1:16:42 
Alright, so the question becomes how do you get this. . . back into this? Right? So you come back over 
here. . . [phone rings]. Drat. [On phone] Yes. Hi, may I help you? Hello. Hello. Hello. With who? Yes. 
Hi. I'm Doug Riley. How may I help you? Yep, bye.

DR  1:17:47 
This machine right here. You all have had physics, right? Okay. There's something called resistance. 
electricity flows from this leg to this leg. And whatever is put between here gets hot, right? 
 
KC  1:18:15 
So that's melting the plastic. 
 
DR  1:18:15 
Take a picture. 
 
[1:18:54-1:23:50, Doug demonstrates and invites Katy to take photos, intakes another customer's pair 
of glasses, a PE teacher who broke them while teaching. Katy makes comment on business, Doug says 
everyday is different, discusses his help and picking up smoking again outside his shop.]  
 
KC  1:23:51 
Are there other things you'd like to share that we haven't asked you about or...Something you're 
surprised we haven't asked you? 
 
DR  1:24:01 
Oh, good heavens. It's too much of an honor. To have—it's too much of an honor. To be able to have 
you here. This thing [referencing metal container his small tools are stored in] 
 
DR  1:24:25 
Four times four is 16 inches of linear storage space, right? When my older brother died and people were 
throwing stuff out, throwing stuff out, they'd hold stuff up, "Anybody want this?" I immediately said, 
"Yes, I want that. Our father made that in the Newport—in the shipyard. As it turns out, there is a water 
line in here, so it had to been a flower vase. Our family had stainless steel in our home when the general 
population didn't know to put the two words stainless and steel together. Um, my mother had stainless 
steel bread making trays.

KC  1:24:26 
Oh yeah.  
 
KC  1:24:54 
That your father made for her? Wow. Did you keep, are those still around? 
 
DR  1:25:30 
Oh, yes. 
 
KC  1:25:34 
Do you make things for your home like that? No. 
 
DR  1:25:40 
Now take your picture. [pause as Katy does so.] 
 
KC  1:25:42 
Perfect. 
 
DR  1:25:52 
I didn't inherit that capability. [phone rings, on phone] Yes. Hi. May I help you? Hello? [hangs up, turns 
on drill, shows work.] 
 
KC  1:27:02 
Very nice.
