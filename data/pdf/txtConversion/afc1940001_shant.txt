Shanty BoyAs I walked out one evening, just as the sun went down,I walked along quite carelessly
till I came to Trenton Town,I heard two girls conversing as slowly I passed by,One said she loved
a farmer's son, the other a shanty boy.The one who loved the farmer's son, to the other one did
say,"The reason that I love him is at home with meHe'll stay at home all winter; to the woods he will
not go,But when the spring it does come in, his lands he'll plow and sew.""Oh! how you love your
farmer's son," the other one did say,"The most of them they are so green that the cows would eat for
hay,How easy it is to tell them whenever they come to town,The smallest boy would up and says 'Old
goes Back how're ye down?'"Oh! how I love my shanty boy who goes up in the fall;He is both stout
and hearty and fit to stand the squall.With pleasure I'll receive him in the spring when he comes
down,His money with me he'll spend quite free, while your farmer boy has none.""Now, what I said
about your shanty boy, I hope you'll pardon me,As from this ignorant farmer's son I hope I'll soon
get free,For, if ever I do get a chance, with a shanty boy I'll go,And leave him broken hearted, his land
to plow and sew." 19E. B2 SHANTY BOY As I walked out one evening, just as the sun went down[ , ?]I
