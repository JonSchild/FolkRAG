TRANSCRIPTION 
Pat Francois: 
My name is Patricia Francois. The date today is February 20, 2016. I'm going to 
have an interview with Ms. Christine Lewis. Interview Ms. Christine Lewis. What 
is your name, or the name you will be using in this interview? [00:00:30] What is 
your current occupation?  
Christine Lewis: 
My name is Christine Lewis, and I am Christine Lewis, Christine Yvette Lewis. I 
was born on Christmas Eve day, and my parents called me Chris Eve as in 
Christmas Eve, which I didn't think of. It took a while to even think of or fathom 
that, wow, Christine Yvette, Christmas Eve. It's Christine Yvette Lewis. Presently, 
I'm an organizer with Domestic Workers United [00:01:00] and work as a side 
time, part-time nanny, hustling, you know. That's pretty much my current 
situation. The bulk of it is organizing with Domestic Workers United, and why 
shouldn't I not? 
Pat Francois: 
Yes, sounds very interesting. What brought you ... What borough do you live in 
or neighborhood and where are you originally from?  
Christine Lewis: 
I live in the borough of [00:01:30] Brooklyn, New York. I'm originally from 
Trinidad. I came from Trinidad. I came from Trinidad on an adventure really. I 
went school for the arts in Trinidad and Tobago. I'm a performance artist, 
writer/poet/fitness guru, if you may, even that. When I came to the States, my 
sisters were already in the United States. They encouraged me to come, and 
that's why I came. I came really to [00:02:00] be ... Some say the bright lights of 
Broadway. Not really the bright lights of Broadway, but they say that America 
has everything. It's a land of milk and honey, where everything sweet flows. It's 
the street paved with gold and they want to be anything here. This is the stage, 
and we are the actors, which is far fetched, which is not really the truth.  
 
That brought me here. When I came here, I came with my daughter [00:02:30] 
literally on my hip. She was five at the time. I stayed, and I had to look for jobs. 
You stay one month, you stay two months, you stay three months. You realize 
living in a place where the season changes, you need clothes. Your daughter 
needs to go to school. You had to get in the system. That brought me to 
domestic work. By the way, I would not necessarily be doing domestic work. 
That's how I became a domestic worker. [00:03:00] And, it's work. It's good 
work, it's work.

No, I follow the guide, give it back. 
Pat Francois: 
I'm supposed to ask you how you become a domestic worker. You're taking me 
... You went ahead. 
Chris: 
It's okay. [crosstalk 00:03:24] 
Christine Lewis: 
No no no. On second question- 
Pat Francois: 
You went ahead my question. Yes. I should be asking you, "How you become a 
domestic [00:03:30] worker?" 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. No but get back. Yes okay, go ahead then. 
Pat Francois: 
[crosstalk 00:03:35] Let me ask the question. 
 
How did you become a domestic worker? [crosstalk 00:03:42] 
Chris: 
It's okay. And it's okay for it to just flow. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay, free flow. 
Chris: 
It's okay. But I hear you. If you want to, if you- 
Pat Francois: 
Ask the question. 
Chris: 
If you want to ask your question, yeah yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. No but I leapt into that so that's fine. 
Chris: 
You'll get to it. You'll all get to it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. [00:04:00] Right, so back to Trinidad. You come, you over stay a time, and 
you have to get into the system. 
Pat Francois: 
So how did you become a domestic worker? 
Christine Lewis: 
I had my four and a half year old daughter, literally on my hip. We say, in the 
islands we say akimbo, holding her like this. But understanding that she has to 
get into Head [00:04:30] Start, and to get into Head Start I have to work as well. 
So one day I sat ... Everybody, my sister would say "It's time to look for work." 
And there was a paper called The Irish Echo. And it's nothing you can do, you 
don't have your documents, you don't have papers you don't have anything. 
You have to find a work. And it's the work allowed for people without papers. 
People who have papers do the job too, but you're looking for work. 
Domestic Workers United

[00:05:00] I remember sitting, combing through The Irish Echo, and there was a 
job situation that ask for a worker. And by the way, by and large I would not be 
a domestic worker. I would be a teacher, I would be an artist a performer. 
Because that's what I went to school for, to be a literacy teacher. That's what I 
used to do. And early head start, deal with children. But anyway the nannying 
job looked [00:05:30] up my alley, that's why I became a domestic worker, 
because I have to look for job now to support my family. Which was my 
daughter, and my village which was my family in the apartment we're living in. 
We have to pay for the space. 
Pat Francois: 
How long have you done this work? And how many positions? 
Christine Lewis: 
As long as Methuselah's beard. And that's just a biblical connotation because 
Methuselah's beard was really long. [00:06:00] I mean, not that I know that his 
beard was long, but I've been doing this for the past 25 years. I've been doing 
nannying position, as a nanny.  
 
But it's funny that you talk about domestic work. The nannying position, it's not 
just seeing a bunch of kid, you're working in this home environment as a 
domestic worker, which is taking care of the kids and the household as well. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay, so what motivated you to [00:06:30] be a part of this project? 
Christine Lewis: 
As a lead organizer with Domestic Workers United what I've recognized is that 
through the ages a lot of people would come into the movement, academics, 
and take our stories, writers. We wouldn't see these stories. We wouldn't see 
these stories or if these stories were told, they were told from the slant of the 
[00:07:00] writer, the person who came into the room to tell the stories. We 
didn't have the other side of that domestic worker, in any article. Most articles. 
We didn't have the vulnerable side of the worker. So it essential, and thanks to 
the Brooklyn Art Council who was able to get us this Archie Green Grant to be 
able to do this project. Why not us to do it? We should be the ones to do it, to 
be able to tell, speak through the power to be able to tell our stories. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes, we are the voices too. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes? Of course [00:07:30] it's our voices, it's our story, as opposed to somebody 
else telling our story and let them get to tell our stories. And not tell it in the 
way that we would want to hear it be told in the Library of Congress.  
Pat Francois: 
I want to know about work inside the home. If you were to meet someone on 
the street, how would you describe what it's like being a domestic worker? Walk 
me through a typical [00:08:00] day routine. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yep. So, kind of easy, you think it's easy a one two three, right? It's not 
necessarily easy. When I meet someone on the street, I want that person ... 
Especially if I see somebody pushing a stroller with pale babies, or even black 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

babies because not every black mother who pushes a baby is the child's mother. 
[00:08:30] Not every white woman who pushes a baby is her baby, sometimes it 
a adopted baby. It's her baby but might be an adopted child, because I've 
worked for families who have adopted babies. And sometimes the black mother 
is the childhood of the pale baby too. We must construe this in our lot, right? 
 
So when I meet I'm kind of wary and I would ask the person if they've heard of 
Domestic Workers United. Without offending people, because sometimes I see 
women, [00:09:00] black mothers walking biracial babies, and you assume it's 
not their baby and they say "Excuse me it's my baby." It's kind of like a shout in 
the face, a shut your mouth. So I'm wary of that. When I meet people I say "Hi, 
my name is Christine. Do you know of Domestic Workers United?" Because we 
have been around for what, the past 15 years. At that time it might have been 
10 years or nine years. But we have a [00:09:30] bill of rights that would protect 
workers. And why not come to a movement that's about women's progression 
and women's power? Who do we look to but each other? It's one way I tell 
them what a domestic worker is. 
 
A domestic worker is anybody who works in our home. You're a wife right? 
You're a mother? You work in the home you're a domestic worker. It's really 
work, it's work that people get paid to do. Like any other job. You're on Wall 
Street you got a job to do, a domestic worker is real work. [00:10:00] So that's 
how I would describe a domestic worker. She's a nanny, she's a caregiver, she's- 
Pat Francois: 
So what is a typical day is like? Like you go through that door in the morning, 
what does that day look like when you enter that door? To the time it's ended, 
[00:10:30] you're in that- 
Christine Lewis: 
You work. Believe it or not you work. And this I what I'm coming to tell you. And 
I just use "work" because people feel like because you take care of a baby in 
somebody's home that you're sitting. You're on the telephone, you're reading, 
you're watching TV. It's not true.  
 
When I get to that home that I work in, I putt around the home. If the mother's 
taking care of the baby, before she leaves for work, I am taking care of that 
woman's home. I'm washing her dishes, I'm straightening up her table, I'm- 
Pat Francois: 
So you're talking [00:11:00] about the responsibilities you have? 
Christine Lewis: 
I'm telling you the typical day. 
Chris: 
That's good, yeah. Paint me that picture. 
Christine Lewis: 
[crosstalk 00:11:08] I'm telling you, and I'm giving you a paradigm. Because the 
connotation is that we don't do work. It's not work, it's not real work. We sit, we 
watch TV, we on cell phone, it's not true. When I get to that home, if there's a 
glass on the table that doesn't belong there, I move it and I put it in the kitchen 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

sink. If the mother is puttering [00:11:30] with her baby, I start to straighten up 
the living room. If there's another child involved I'm helping prepare that child 
for school. I'm taking care of the dishes. I'm loading the dishwasher, I'm taking 
care of the dishwasher. The wares in the sink. I'm getting ready to sweep the 
floor, because I have to play with the baby on the floor. 
 
I take care of that home, the way I take care of my home. I'm in that space for 
eight hours. Eight and half [00:12:00] or sometime 12 hours, I want that place to 
be pristine as the way my home is. And by the way, that home is more pristine 
than my home. It's like the shoemaker and the shoe. The shoemaker don't 
always have a good pair of shoe, and he builds the shoe. My home is in disarray, 
but I make sure where my workspace is it's tidy. Because I have to take care of 
that child, I have to be on the floor with that child. I have to take up every little 
piece of debris that's on that carpet or that floor. So that I and that child could 
interact.  
 
Then when that mother hands that baby off to me, [00:12:30] it's playing with 
the baby. Making sure the baby's okay. It's cooking food for the baby, it's 
pureeing zucchini, it's pureeing carrots, it's pureeing ... And then, by the way, 
that mother leaves her list, that she wants done with her child. And I have to 
follow that by rote. And you know why? I do it as if Jesus Christ is looking at me 
because this is what the mother wants. No cut to the chase. Even though she 
wrong, she might be wrong. I kind of do it by what she wants. So [00:13:00] until 
she comes, I've cooked, and if there's another child in the house I'm prepared 
for that child when that child comes from school. 
 
And by the way, I have to go outside, winter spring summer and fall, and take 
that child for a walk. Meet play friends, create friendships, and everything. And 
teach the child too, zero to six is a learning age. So it's a full day, it never stops. 
Pat Francois: 
So that includes the other activities besides what goes on within the house? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yep. [00:13:30] Walk in, playing, teaching. By the way teaching is not included, 
right?  
Pat Francois: 
Correct. 
Christine Lewis: 
But because I come so qualified, I should say "I," speak for myself, that I could 
teach the child, as a teacher and as an artist. Give everything that the child 
needs. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes. I also understood and heard the Latina sisters, they speak Spanish and also 
have [00:14:00] to teach Spanish. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yep. Depending on the language that one speak. They don't get paid for fun 
enough too. A domestic worker may not get paid for teaching that child her 
native language, but it's an expectation from some parents. And it's a gift when 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

you have somebody who can speak another language and teach another 
language to your children. 
Pat Francois: 
So, What skills do you need to be a domestic [00:14:30] worker, and how did 
you learn them? 
Christine Lewis: 
Through being a parent. Motherhood teaches you what you have to learn for 
life, right? Our parents, we saw our parents, and then we become parents 
ourselves. I would say there isn't any schoolbook that could teach you to be a 
domestic worker. It's funny because years ago I heard Dr. Rex Bedford from 
[00:15:00] the University of Cave Hill, on a campus actually in Jamaica. He said 
tie the heifer and turn the bull loose. Tie the heifer and turn the bull loose. 
Which meant that, women were to keep the girls in the home and teach them 
to cook and sew. And do all the need[inaudible 00:15:22] for put around the 
home. While the boys, the sons able to go out and make hay. Do what they 
want to do outside. [00:15:30] Boys won't want to sew and cook.  
 
It's not true because some parents instill that in their sons. But girls' work is 
primarily, indigenously, rooted in the home. And so there was no school or 
book. No matter how the college tell you to raise children, it's an innate 
maternal instinct that you have to do, when you dealing with children. So there 
was no skills ... It's funny when parents come and they say they [00:16:00] just 
ready so and so, and it changes. The children grow, and the books go through 
the window. In the school of hard knock. You pass down you saw what your 
parents do. And by the way, what your parents do, is not what you will do, 
because we relearn and unlearn behaviors, as we go along.  
 
I want to raise my children, or the children that I work for, the way my parents 
might have raised me. They were strict people, I have unlearned [00:16:30] that. 
That we talk to our children, talk till we blue in the face. You don't hit them, you 
don't ... But you reason with them and that's what I did with my daughter. This 
is what I bring to the home that I work in, because there's also cultural 
indifferences. 
Pat Francois: 
So is there anything that people who employ you, might have learned from you? 
Christine Lewis: 
A way of life, culture. [00:17:00] We have a notion of each other that's not true, 
that's embedded in our society, that if we come from a third world country 
we're not as articulated, we're not as bright, we're not as ... We don't have 
degrees like some of these parents have. Or we haven't attained higher level of 
learning. We talk about academical skills. 
 
They've learned a lot from us. Parenting, language, the way we speak. 
[00:17:30] The way we dance, the way we sing a song to the children. Culture 
makes a difference. I remember singing to the child and the parent looked at me 
because every day I had a new song to sing. And I think she was ... I could see an 
amazement, how amazed and pleased she was that "Wow, here it is Christine is 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
6
bringing a new song." And her little daughter would look at me and say "Oh you 
know that sing that to me again!"  
 
By the way the songs that I might sing for the children, [00:18:00] is not what 
the nursery school might teaches the children. Because I come from a place of 
Head Start, and I came from a place of Mother Goose where all the old nursery 
rhymes. The kids will say "wow." I will sing "One, Two, buckle my shoe. Three, 
four, shut the door. Five, six, pick up sticks. Seven, eight, lay them straight. Nine, 
ten, a big fat hen." Half of the kids don't even know that, the kids watch me and 
they laugh. 
 
So it's a joie de vivre to bring something new and to see the parent ... Because 
the parents They don't know, what the teachers [00:18:30] do. Especially if 
parents with first children. I have one daughter, I was a first time parent myself. 
We don't know everything. And so we're learning, we're learning, we're 
learning, yeah? 
Chris: 
Let me just interrupt. Just make sure that ... This is just a canvas. Make sure you 
... Just eye contact. You guys have got this covered, this is great. But when 
there's somebody that you're talking to that might not be comfortable 
answering these questions, you want to be just [00:19:00] always looking at 
them. And don't worry about the next question. I know that's the thing is you 
want to anticipate the next question, make sure you're covering it. You can go 
back, just make sure you're watching and nodding. Giving feedback.  
 
You guys are great, I worry about the person that you interview that is not 
comfortable. And you want to just make sure that they feel like you're listening. 
And you can go anywhere you want. If you feel like ... It's like a painting, and this 
is a [00:19:30] blank canvas. If she says something you like, and you want to 
explore that connects to you, conversation. [crosstalk 00:19:37] It's this 
complicated thing of, getting the questions but also diverging. 
Christine Lewis: 
I'm pulling from you, if something [crosstalk 00:19:44] 
Chris: 
It's wonderful. So you're talking about ... Yeah you were on question seven, 
because you just talked about what you learn, teach parents. 
Pat Francois: 
Family's uses. 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:20:00] Right, so we were talking about the language folktales, right. Yeah, so 
the Anansi stories, right? Kids like ... Like a little girl would say to me ... It's funny 
because I would say to her "If you don't act right, there's the good witch, of 
Good Will who's outside your door. And there's a bad witch of Ill Will, if you 
don't act right, she's outside [00:20:30] your door. And she's dressed colorful." 
And she would say "Christine that's not true!" And she's so eager to hear more 
of these stories, because kids like make believe. And I'm so silly, I'm a big child 
at heart. Those stories intrigue, intrigue. Especially when she's not being nice to 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
7
me. The good witch is outside your door, and she's dressed in a wide array of 
colors. And she looks me up and down and she laughed the loudest. 
 
[00:21:00] My employers always want to know, "Christine, what it is, what it is 
you're doing this weekend?" What it is. I have a dance recital, I dance, I do Afro-
Cuban, I do the poetry workshop, we do acting. So it's always something new to 
hear. I don't want to tell them too much really too, for them to know well every 
move. But it's nice to share I say "I'm doing Afro-Cuban this week." I'm doing 
Purim, [00:21:30] for Jew's liberation and economic justice. One parent say to 
me "Will you invite me?" She's Jewish. I would invite her to the Purim festival. 
It's the story of Esther and Haman. 
 
So you notice, to have this Christian woman, who's involved with Purim, and the 
Jews don't believe in Jesus Christ as the Christians do. And here it is I'm play 
Vashti, or Esther in the Purim story, or the joker. It's like "wow" across the 
board. So it brings a joie de vivre to the home. The owners want the foods too. 
One [00:22:00] of my last jobs I remember bringing roti, curry chicken and roti 
dhal puri. Oh my God, my little charge loved it. He loved the patties, the 
Jamaican patties. He licked his fingers and he asked for more, he wanted more. 
So they enjoy ... It's a gift, I think it's a gift when we come from different 
countries and islands, to be able to work in the home and give to these homes 
that we work [00:22:30] in. 
Pat Francois: 
What conditions do you face throughout your work? 
Christine Lewis: 
There is no guideline, for lunch sometimes. There is no gray area set up for 
lunch. So you find that sometimes you could be working through your break. 
You're just working that eight hours or 12, you have no break. 12 hours or 14 
hours. You really can't sit [00:23:00] to eat because if you have a baby, you have 
to listen to that monitor for when that child cries. There are times children will 
cry, some parents don't want the children to cry. You have to hold these 
children up, sometimes you're tired too. So there is really no break, no coverage 
for lunch.  
 
There is no food provided. Some people eat just greens. Sometimes I might 
want a cookie, I might want the MnM's. Some parents [00:23:30] give the 
children a straight laced diet, there is nothing set up for me to eat. 
Pat Francois: 
So as a domestic worker you don't have schedule, let's say like you work four 
hours in the morning time and then you get a break where you can have your 
lunch or anything like this, sort of like that? 
Christine Lewis: 
And I'll tell you something, it depends on the employers that you work with. 
There are employers who I worked with where I could sit long periods and enjoy 
a newspaper and read. There were some employers where I had to be working 
[00:24:00] around the clock. You're right, it should be mandated where you 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
8
work four hours and when midday come, whether it's twelve O'Clock or one 
O'Clock, in America it's two O'Clock, to have a lunch hour. 
 
But how could you not do, you hear a child crying? And then you have colicky 
babies, you have babies that are miserable! You have nice babies, the baby I 
work with is a sweet baby. There are miserable babies. There are babies with 
multiple personalities, you have to give in to that. And I'm like a big baby myself, 
I can't- 
Pat Francois: 
[00:24:30] Because you're human too. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah! I can't see the child crying and not pick up the child or, listen to that 
monitor. I don't want the baby to cry. 
Pat Francois: 
This is why I would say, you're entitled to have that lunch. If you give us half an 
hour to give us that meal because, you must have the energy to do this work. 
[inaudible 00:24:53]taken care of and, you must [00:25:00] be able to be 
vibrant, because the kids are the energetic and you want to be keeping up with 
them. You want to see well, or hear, you get so tired or weak because you didn't 
get a chance to eat, and next thing you have the energy to keep up with the 
baby. [inaudible 00:25:12], and next thing the baby fall. What is going to happen 
to you? 
Christine Lewis: 
Right, and I hear all of that, but let me just say on record too, I've had [00:25:30] 
good employers. I've really had good employers, who ... Easy going like myself. 
They say opposites attract, or sometimes you attract who you go for. I establish 
my code in the home. I say "Listen, this is what I'm doing or this is what I'm not 
comfortable doing." So right there are boundaries. My employer know right 
away, I feel okay doing this, or I don't feel okay doing that. So I've really not 
faced really horrendous conditions. I must speak truth to that, [00:26:00] 
because of who I am. I came in with listen. And for me there was no contract. It 
was like, we going to do this on Monday or we going to do this on Tuesday, or 
this day is entire day.  
 
I must say however, I hate a list. One of the jobs I worked at, I was given a list. 
And I remember going into that job, baby bottles to me must be washed every 
time a baby is already having his milk or her milk. [00:26:30] What happens with 
a baby's bottle? If you look at the milk that we give the babies. It's like spore 
immediately if you don't wash that bottle. The hardest thing to remove from a 
baby's bottle, is grown on milk spore. The residue of the milk sits in the baby's 
bottle, it's gunky, it's horrible, I don't know if people notice it.  
 
This woman would leave 12 bottles, no lie, standing like continental soldiers 
along [inaudible 00:27:00] pink sink [00:27:00] that she had, I remember it 
vividly because I wrote about it, as somebody who writes, to wash. I begin that 
... That job for me was Wednesday to Sunday I never work Wednesday to 
Sunday in America, but what you don't know don't hurt you. And that was me 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

bending backward, because I needed a paycheck. Wednesday to Sunday. So my 
weekends were filled with working. I couldn't socialize with my parents who 
would be visiting, or Caribbean folks who like to have a good time on weekends, 
[00:27:30] we work long. I remember going there every Wednesday morning, 
and those 12 bottles, because she didn't want them washed in the dishwasher. 
And by that time those bottles were horrible. 
 
You want to be obedient, because a parents asks for what they want. There was 
a time I started to wash it with my hands. Use the scour and [00:28:00] scour 
out that hard, sticky residue of milk. 
Pat Francois: 
[crosstalk 00:28:04]Mommies do long time back at home, but the scrubber to 
get that excess milk out of it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Thank you. And then after that, I cut to the chase. Nonetheless wiser I put it in 
the washing machine, in the dishwasher. Hell to the yes! Because it was difficult. 
12 bottles!? On a Wednesday? 
Pat Francois: 
So that means when you weren't present, [00:28:30] nobody was washing. 
Christine Lewis: 
That's right. That woman didn't want to wash a tittle of a bottle. And I fell for 
the child, you know why I fell for the child? It's funny because the child was a 
Caribbean baby, who was adopted by this American mother. So there was a 
closeness, you understand me? Oh, he was such a sweet baby, little Elliot. 
Pat Francois: 
Okay, [00:29:00] so what is the best part of your job? And give an 
example.[00:29:05] 
Christine Lewis: 
Laughter. When you can make these children laugh. You know what it is? I've 
worked at a job for 19 years. Raising those children, to become a full citizen. 
And to see those children go to college. It's not for shit in front of their parents. 
But there goes the grace of God. It's your love, your teaching, [00:29:30] what 
you bring to this home to enable such ... By the way, I wouldn't get praise for it, 
I'm not looking for praise for it. But when those children go to Yale and Harvard, 
and we were the initial first ... I was the initial first teacher of that child. Because 
I bore the child the root, the ABC's, Harold and the Purple Crayon, Funny Little 
Teddy Bear, all those stories, because I'm an avid reader. And bring those books 
and watch the joy on those [00:30:00] children's face. And laugh. And know that 
those children are happy under your watch, they're just happy. There is no 
accidents, because accidents happen. IT's the best part. 
 
And you know what too? Interacting with parents. Having the relationship ... I 
have had wonderful relationships with my employers, as friends. They say we 
couldn't be friends, right? Black and white mothers, and [00:30:30] the black 
women and white women we're so distrustful of each other we can't be friends. 
Hearing my employer share her stories, what she'd been through with her 
husband, it was like a sister friend relationship. You and I will say "Well, girl this 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027

is what I went through today. You know well my husband was this today. 
Christine he was an ass today." Can I say ass on taping? 
Chris: 
Yeah. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. "He was an asshole today." Or see them go through the divorce. And with 
that you were that anchor, that back bone that they could lay it on you. 
[00:31:00] So apart from raising these children, we were mentoring parents.  
Pat Francois: 
Yes, truly. 
Christine Lewis: 
Hello, hello hello. And I get emotional, it's our story, we were mentors to the 
parents. 
 
When I look at my kids go to college, and see them become who they are when I 
ask them "How you doing?" And they say, "Christine I'm happy. I'm [00:31:30] 
enjoying, I'm-I'm part of the student body." 
 
I remember, you see how I wrap my hair? One of the girls used to go to school 
with her head wrapped. Until the school said she could no longer come. And for 
some reason I felt she was looking at me with my hair wrap, she used to put on 
a little bandanna religiously to go to school. So they would take from you. Just 
take a look around the house and know that, you come in this space and you 
bring your joy and your light. That's [00:32:00] what I bring to my workspace, 
that's the best part. 
Pat Francois: 
How is your relationship with your current employer? 
Christine Lewis: 
It's good. 
Chris: 
I'm sorry, you skipped the worst part of your job. Did you skip that or did you go 
over that? 
Pat Francois: 
What is the worst part of your job? And give [00:32:30] an example. 
Christine Lewis: 
Okay. Let me tell you, the worst part of my job, is when you sit there for 12, 14 
hours, and these parents call and say "I'm running a little late." By the way I 
have my ... By the way me, Christine, have her poetry workshop to go to. Or 
have to meet a date or a friend. I am stuck in that home. Because what can I do? 
When you call me after nine or ten hours and say you're running late, I can't 
leave your child. I can't leave your child and leave the home. I have to sit 
[00:33:00] with that child. 
 
Knowing also, that you're not reimbursed for that hour later, that two or three 
hours that you stay later. It's the worst part.  
Pat Francois: 
You don't get overtime pay. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
11
Christine Lewis: 
No overtime pay. 
Pat Francois: 
That's a challenge 
Christine Lewis: 
And a parent who don't look you in the eye and talk to you about their child, but 
ask the child, "Hi Harry, how was your day?" And Harry is about- 
Pat Francois: 
As Harry taking care of himself. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, well- 
Pat Francois: 
I'm invisible [crosstalk 00:33:27] 
Christine Lewis: 
[00:33:30] Harry's three months, Harry can't talk. Harry can't talk, right? "Harry 
how was your day?" Oh, I don't have a life, Christine how was your day? How 
was your weekend? Like I would ask my ... What did you do, what was exciting? 
As you just say, the invisible workforce. I'm whatever, I'm chopped liver. I'm a 
person in your home!  
 
The part of where they call you and say ... They didn't prepare [00:34:00] you 
that morning. "Okay, I'll be late Thursday evening." When you call and say 
you're coming in late. And that late is about 10:30. And they didn't put me in a 
taxi to go to Brooklyn or the Bronx, where I used to live before. Or even 
Brooklyn. 
Pat Francois: 
Did they give you dinner? 
Christine Lewis: 
No. Or put me in a cab to go home. It could be ... Especially when you have a 
life, I had a life. I [00:34:30] was going to workshops, I was going to school. I 
was- 
Pat Francois: 
And you have a daughter. 
Christine Lewis: 
I had my ... At the time my daughter was ... Thank you. I have to rely on my 
sister to take care of my daughter, or help my daughter. Or while I'm on the job, 
working late, call back to make sure my daughter was inside. Who was taking 
care of my child? So it was really one of the worse parts. I've never had physical 
abuse, I've never had disrespect per [00:35:00] say. But that was one of the 
times when I wanted just go on the upper west side and sit in a little bar and 
have a cup of coffee to myself, or, devoid of the world. 
 
Let me tell you something, childcare's not easy work. It's not. It's back bending, 
it's holding a child, it's making sure that that child is okay, that that child is not in 
pain. Especially when that child is teething, especially has a cold and that child is 
getting up every two three minutes. You can't even sit and read a paper 
[00:35:30] much less watch television. 
Domestic Workers United

Pat Francois: 
You're talking real work. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. And then if you have another charge to pick up, your eyes is on the clock. 
There is no time, household is never done. You do housework in somebody's 
home, and you go home to do housework in your home. It's never done. It's 
hard work. But, when your household is fulfilled, that you work [00:36:00] in, 
there's a reassuring feeling, and it's a good feeling that makes it good. I've had 
... That part of calling that day and saying that you can't come home early, 
because such and such. Oh God it's the worst part. 
Pat Francois: 
Just knowing that you're being taken advantage of. 
Christine Lewis: 
I have a life. 
Pat Francois: 
Because not only that, you say there is no overtime pay. 
Christine Lewis: 
That [00:36:30] too. 
Pat Francois: 
And then you have a daughter at home, where it makes you more worried and 
concerned as a parent. Because you're not only a domestic worker you are a 
parent too. 
Christine Lewis: 
Not even that, too. Thank you for that reason too. Most of the homes I worked 
in had a gated ... What I mean gated communities, had doorman. When I leave 
Manhattan upper west side, totally upper west side, and I went back to 
Brooklyn after 10:00 11:00, I was in the wilderness on my own. Because 
everybody knew the reputation the Bronx had, or some parts of Brooklyn have. I 
was walking ... By the way not going into a doorman building. I had to look 
behind my back. Make [00:37:00] sure that on that bus, to take my keys out of 
my bag, before I get to my door. 
 
Here is the divide. They were coming into a doorman building, I wasn't coming 
into a doorman building. I was- 
Pat Francois: 
[crosstalk 00:37:13] could be hanging around. 
Christine Lewis: 
How many times I look back in the night, walking across the street midnight, 
close to midnight, looking back, looking over my shoulder? But there goes the 
grace of God, we rely on faith. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes, I agree. How is your relationship [00:37:30] with your current employer? 
Christine Lewis: 
It's good. It's good, it's- 
Pat Francois: 
When you say "good" what do you mean good? 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah, okay. So I want to expound and break it down. 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
13
 
When you go to a job you don't know these people, you never don know 
somebody. So you're always looking over your shoulder. They're looking at me 
the way I'm looking at them, I'm sure. It's good in that we can dialogue, I'm big 
on dialoguing, on communication for children. Because I'm working for you, I'm 
working in the home, [00:38:00] and we must have a dialogue concerning the 
child or your children that I work for. So it has to be good in that sense. I relate 
to the parents that I work for, and they relate to me. We're able to have a good 
rapport, communication is my basis on any job that I work for. 
 
Any interview that I go on, I can't emphasize, forget the children. You and I have 
to dialogue over the children. The children can't negotiate with you. If you come 
home late and the child [00:38:30] is not well, I have to tell you about the child. 
It's in our best interest that we force the relationship. We don't have to be best 
friends, but let us have a relationship. And yes, I'm able to communicate and 
those parents are able to articulate their feelings to me, and I'm able to 
articulate my feelings back to them. As it relates to the work that I do in the 
home. 
Pat Francois: 
Understanding [00:39:00] what you just said, but sill I'll ask you this question. 
What challenges, or sorts of tension, do you face on the job? 
Christine Lewis: 
That's a good question. Because, I already come as a parent to your home. That 
goes ... The invisibility. That goes through the door. I'm having a mother still tell 
me how to cook the baby's food. How to do it, how to blanch it, how to bake it. 
How to do it just right. I'm coming up against [00:39:30] the teaching of Dr. 
[00:39:31]Leash, as for being in the school of life, and raising children. My 
daughter's 31 years old. She hasn't had a fall. She hasn't had a dislocated hip or 
elbow, a bang or bruise on her elbow. Doesn't that say a lot? Here it is you're 
having a woman with a 31 year old daughter who's working, who is a baby. That 
has taken to college and school, [00:40:00] and she's in the workforce too. And 
you're still going to a house where parents still tell you to do, "Hold the baby 
this way. Put him in the crib this way." And he'll fall asleep any which way? 
Pat Francois: 
And you been a mother over three decades. 
Christine Lewis: 
Right. 
Pat Francois: 
And a mother who been a mother only months, telling you how to hold a baby. 
Christine Lewis: 
How to hold a baby. What to put on him when he's going outside. [00:40:30] By 
the way I've been on the ... How long I've said I've been on the job? 25, 20 some 
years? I've been babysitting. Tentatively, off and on. The will, I think the will. I'm 
a strong person, and sometimes I come up against really strong parents. One 
day I had to tell a parent, "I am not doing any housework, because you hired me 
to be the ear [00:41:00] and eye for your child." I say "This house could be on 
fire, I'm taking care of your children. I'm ain't going no laundry. I'm not going 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
14
down to walk no dog." My focus is on the job. Because what it is, she hired me 
to take care of the child, but yet wanted me to mop, do, do do do do do. 
 
My focus was on the child. And she had a strong will, and I had a strong will. I 
remember when there was a blizzard of 1996, [00:41:30] my God, everything in 
New York and it's mother froze over. My employer was living in Manhattan. 
There was no trains, at that time I was in the Bronx, no trains were leaving the 
Bronx to go to manhattan. In manhattan, everything was on the ground and 
everything was melted. Trains could go from Wall Street to 96th Street and 
back. They going to go on road, they're going to go anyway. Brooklyn and Bronx, 
the blizzard of '96, it was horrible. I remember [00:42:00] that was the end of 
my job. Because I made it up in my mind, that I'm not going to work that day. I 
had ask my employer, "Are you crazy? You want me to come out in a snow 
blizzard?" And the more we argued the more I covered my errors with a sheet. I 
remember as if it was yesterday. Who expected that? Who does that? There 
was no trains, but she was strong will and I was strong will and I wasn't backing 
down. 
 
[00:42:30] Another situation I remember when, my job was from 8:30, and for 
some reason every morning that train in the Bronx would come in a little late. I 
remember reaching the embassy, minutes to nine. The job was 8:30, I reach a 
little late, it was five minutes late. And we got into it and she said "You're rude." 
I said "Well why don't you leave? You start the quarrel with me. I am here, go 
just go go go go." She said well she don't have an understanding boss. I said "I 
understand it too, I don't have an understanding [00:43:00] boss too." Because 
things happen on the trains. So those are the tensions that we face, the 
moment that I'm late. You go out the house I'm all ready! How many years I'm 
working for you now? 
 
Those are the wills. What we feed our children, how we ... Here the tensions are 
things like TV. I'm not a TV person, I'm a book person. I would read your children 
a story, you don't have to tell me "Turn off the TV." By the way I like to watch 
news at 5 o'clock. Give that to me. I like to know what's going around in my 
neighborhood, [00:43:30] that's not watching soap opera. Every caribbean don't 
watch soap opera, that's not true. That's a stereotype too. We sit around and 
watch Nancy tweet tweet tweet. Not all of us like TV, and it's a stereotype 
because across the board everybody likes the ... I worked for an employer who 
worked for NBC. She loved the oldie goldies. She would go into her room when 
she came home a six o'clock [00:44:00] and watch her oldie goldies. I'm talking 
about real oldie goldies. And it worked for her because it's the job that she was 
in. 
 
So those are the tension. You go, if I'm two minutes late, you go just get out the 
house and stop quarrel. We got into those quarrels. Until a point she said to me 
"you are rude Christine." And I would take that. I had to stand up for who I was, 
I am.

Pat Francois: 
What was the original agreement with your employer and it was violated. Have 
you [00:44:30] had any? 
Christine Lewis: 
No. I've worked with ... It's funny that you actually ask that question. This 
depends, too. I have worked without contracts, just word of mouth. And it 
worked. I don't go with no piece of paper. This is what we want, this is what 
you're going to pay me, this is what we going to do. They were pretty generous. 
The first job when I came to this country in 1990, I must [00:45:00] say there 
was, the parent and I we agreed. The pay was short. I remember working from 
8:30 to 10:30, and the pay at the end of the week was $350. I really thought it 
was money. Because I was new I didn't [inaudible 00:45:17]the value of the US 
dollar, they all think the US Dollar is gross, right? 
 
$350, but in 1990 it went a long way. When I reach home, I give [00:45:30] my 
sister $150. Looking back now, in hindsight, that was a lot of money, to give her 
for us to live. To pay for the apartment space like telephone. She was holding up 
her own. When I look back, I should have had more money. Because the truth of 
it I give my sister 150, so that we could live decently. I thought $350 pay was 
real money. $350 in 1990. Again I was new, [00:46:00] I didn't know too much of 
the value of the American dollar, in terms of work relationship. So that was way 
below the minimum wage. It was $6.25, it was $6 something. I was working for 
less than the minimum wage. You talking about 8:30, to about 9:30 at night, 
10:30. 
Pat Francois: 
Well that like modern day slavery. 
Christine Lewis: 
I had no idea. 
Pat Francois: 
And you're underpaid. 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh yes! It was. Seriously, you knew, there's no school or books [00:46:30] that 
tell you how much you should work- 
Pat Francois: 
There was no Domestic Workers United. 
Christine Lewis: 
No and there was no guideline, you're right. 
Pat Francois: 
No way to set your rights.. 
Christine Lewis: 
No guideline. And as you just say, what was the word you use? No agreement. 
When I looked at The Irish Echo and came upon this job, I was the one of 75 
people. And I remember saying to her "I am the last person on line, let me be 
the first person to get a job." And [00:47:00] I was the first person. No 
agreement. 
 
You know what it is? You go into these jobs just trusting, that people will do the 
right thing. But you know what? It's not always cut and dried. You're right. There 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
16
was no agreement, no written thing, but you're trusting. I'm trusting that if I 
work overtime ... I tell you something though, with that $350, and tentatively it 
would be $375 week ending depending on, I would get bonus. That was 
[00:47:30] my first job, that I knew that I got bonus. Say what you will, that 
woman give me bonus. As small as the pay was, I got bonus. 
 
The other job after that I was able to gauge, how important bonus was to 
working. It was a formal say, final cue. I would have kind of not traded in the 
$350, but take the bonus if you're me, if that makes sense. You understand? I 
didn't get the additional money for the work week, but that $300, [00:48:00] 
that bonus is what would suffice at the end of the year. 
Pat Francois: 
So then it really wasn't violated and resolved. 
Christine Lewis: 
Well I was wage theft. Yes. Even though it wasn't written on paper, it's still a 
form of wage theft. It's poverty wage. 
Pat Francois: 
Because it was being paid under- 
Christine Lewis: 
Less than the minimum wage at that time which I think was six something at 
that time. It incrementally ... Without knowing though, [00:48:30] because it 
wasn't written though. You know why? Historically, black women give care. 
Coming from a place of history, right? That we give care, and we give care to 
[inaudible 00:48:41], for little or anything. We get the scraps. 
Pat Francois: 
So this is where I must add, and emphasize, about how important it is having an 
organization [00:49:00] as Domestic Workers United. 
Christine Lewis: 
Of course. To set you right. Again, this is where the question of the women, in 
1990 ask the question, "Who do we go to, Christine, who do we go through?" 
And I was asking those same questions. When I was expected to come out in the 
snow and blizzard, was I going to be overpaid? What about weekends that I 
lived in, stayed in. The long hours, my long hours. My position that I worked in, 
those 8:30 to 10:30, ultimately should have been a live [00:49:30] in position. 
But I prayed my way out of it because I really didn't want to live in nobody's 
home because I had my daughter. 
 
What we take, it was really a lived in position, but I was able to talk my out of it 
because it was a small space they were in. The little boy had his room, they 
were in the bedroom, there was no room for me. But technically it was a live in 
position that I was able to talk my way out of. 
Pat Francois: 
[00:50:00] Do you feel that the amount of hours you work are being respected? 
Christine Lewis: 
I would say today yes. Back then, in 1990 no. It really wasn't. And again, these 
job situations, as you talk about guidelines and agreement, these jobs that I do 
working in the home, it's a conscionable [00:50:30] thing. You must know that if 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
17
you have a worker from 8:30 to 10:30, and she's got a family, that you really 
should do the right thing by her. So it really wasn't respected, it was the thing to 
do because it's an expectation that of women of color would clean the bottom 
of pale babies children for nothing. We work toward nothing. You use the word 
just now "invisible." It's expected. Back then, no it wasn't respected. 
 
Now, today, [00:51:00] 2016, for me, I'm telling my story, it is respected now. 
But back in 1990 it wasn't, even 2007 it wasn't respected. And I've changed jobs. 
I've changed three four five, four jobs. From 2007 to now, it's been respected. 
Pat Francois: 
I will say I believe as a person interviewing workers, I would agree and disagree. 
Maybe that is for you. But today I still hear women complaining about still being 
underpaid, working long hours and still getting short pay. And your time is not 
really being respected. [00:51:30] They're not being honored for those amount 
of hours, or even pay for the hours that they working for. And as earlier you 
mentioned that, you knew your [00:52:00] boss may call and say ...This is time 
now you want to go home and take care of your family. And your boss is going 
to call you and say "You know I'll be late." When you thinking it might be half an 
hour, a hour. It's two three hours late. And then there will be injustice coming 
again, by not paying pay for those three or four excess hours. [00:52:30] So this 
is why I still hear women complaining and saying that they working long hours 
and still being underpaid. 
Christine Lewis: 
It's a violation. It's not in the books, before the bill of rights it's not in the book. 
It's a violation. And that's why I say these jobs with these parents, it's a 
conscionable thing. You work long hours, by golly. You work for that person, you 
don't put me in a taxi, or give me a decent living wage to live with, first to begin. 
It's not respected! Again I use [00:53:00] the word wage theft, poverty wages. 
Listen, I know what it is to ... When I tell you about $350 that's poverty wages, in 
hindsight. That's poverty wages. And I thought it was big mind you. I thought it 
was big money. 
 
With all the work I do $350 today? 2010, 2016? Hell no. 
Pat Francois: 
This is a perfect example of how women still don't know their rights. Still don't 
know that they [00:53:30] entitled, or they included in the labor laws, up to this 
day. I'll also add that injustice is truly modern day slavery, because it may be 
good for you today, but another sister may be complaining. She may be 
physically abused, verbally abused. I remember one saying that when she stand 
up for her rights that she'd been threatened, [00:54:00] being an immigrant 
woman, with immigration. I call it the emotional abuse. The mental abuse, it's a 
form of abuse. 
Christine Lewis: 
It is abuse.  
Pat Francois: 
Yes. So do you feel that your holiday schedule is been respected? 
Domestic Workers United 
 afc2015/027
18
Christine Lewis: 
Let me give you that one too. Again my first job. I remember, again, when I start 
these jobs there is no [00:54:30] books that say "Oh, you're privy to time off or 
pay. Or you're privy to holiday as Martin Luther King Day. You're not supposed 
to work-" You don't know these things, right? You know how you know these 
things? Sitting in the path from the older ones who have been at the job long 
before you. That's how we learn. You're on the path benches where the kids are 
and the kids say, the charge. And the nanny would say, "You know it's Memorial 
Day tomorrow. What are you doing tomorrow, are you hanging out tomorrow?" 
That year in, that other year you realize, that first year you don't [00:55:00] 
know because you don't know the American holidays. You get sucked into it.  
 
So one year I work miss honey, I work a Memorial weekend. I work a Labor Day 
weekend. Everybody know Labor Day is Caribbean Carnival day in Brooklyn. We 
Caribbean citizens. 
Pat Francois: 
Yes, Caribbean Day. 
Christine Lewis: 
Everybody having a good time. So that year, I worked. And there was no pay, 
she didn't say anything. SO I worked on Memorial Day, 1990. [00:55:30] 1990 
and 1991, right? On Memorial Day ... 1990, 1990, right. What come after 1990? 
1990 and how much? 
Pat Francois: 
91. 
Christine Lewis: 
91 right. Thank you. Okay, my memory shot. 1991, thank you. 
 
1991, [00:56:00] I can recall as if was yesterday. I work Memorial day, and I 
come back and I work Labor day. I say, "Okay." The next year I get a little wise, 
because when I started the job, I think I started the job in 1990 somewhere in 
wintertime. The cold months of 1990. 1991 I worked the holidays. Oh yeah, 
1992 didn't catch me working them holidays the next year. [00:56:30] My 
employers asks me how I know that. I said "But, everybody knows a holiday. The 
Memorial Weekend, and the Labor Day weekend, everybody knows a holiday. 
Miss Honey I have something to do on Memorial weekend. And on Labor Day I 
have something to do." I was playing [inaudible 00:56:47] on the park, we are 
playing [inaudible 00:56:49]. You are right. Take that to the bridge, and when 
you reach to the bridge, tell your mother how you get over. 
Pat Francois: 
After that [00:57:00] then, your holidays not respected. 
Christine Lewis: 
It wasn't. It really wasn't. Because ... Again, cultural. I come from a different 
place where the days vary. We had emancipation, the Christmas. Christmas you 
had almost off the entire week. In Trinidad it was off the entire week. It was 
fete. As a culture people we love fete, we love a good time. We are a very 
hospitable people. When I came [00:57:30] here it was strange. It's all about 
commercialization, these holidays are about commercialization. So when you 
look at Christmas, my birthday's the 24th of December, and you work Christmas

... No you get Christmas Day off but you had to work Boxing Day. Boxing Day for 
the British, for the Caribbean Island was a holiday. You were like, "Wait a 
minute. You're working? Wow." So it was hard. You come up to New Year's now. 
New Year's Weekend it was off again. You working [00:58:00] All Year's Day. The 
31st of ... It was off where you came from. You're working those days. 
 
It was really a culture shock too. Knowing that the American's and the British 
have two different ... We alluded to the British holidays. We have time off for 
Lent period, for the Christians. You came here and you realize, what a minute, 
Good Friday you're working. You started to make a stand because you wanted 
to do the stations of the cross, for Good Friday you wanted to make the nine 
or[inaudible 00:58:27]. You wanted to [00:58:30] go and pray to Christ nine 
times, nine stations of the cross, seven stations of the cross. You couldn't do 
that on Good Friday wow. It wasn't respected. As Christian. 
 
And you've given in to the holidays, right? But it really wasn't respected. You 
had to demand it. I could give a tantamount of stories about that holiday, but 
[00:59:00] what you don't know. 
Pat Francois: 
Won't hurt you. 
Christine Lewis: 
Did we say it right? 
Pat Francois: 
What you don't know won't hurt you. I would so no it will effect you. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yeah. And what don't kill you make you stronger, which is not true too. Which is 
not always true. We use that loosely. What don't kill you, make you stronger. Is 
not true too. 
 
Because you have to know. You really have to know sometimes. You have to 
have a value, and a vision [00:59:30] system, of what is right and wrong. And 
when you've been exploited, because there's a lot of exploitation. And it's 
[sucked 00:59:36] along these jobs. 
 
When you work that Holiday, and realized you worked that holiday and you 
didn't get pay for it. You get the same pay. Now you know. 
Pat Francois: 
Will you say that you- 
Christine Lewis: 
Let me say, I'm sorry before you go on, let me say today now, from 2007 to now, 
my holidays has been respected. 
Pat Francois: 
Because you demanded [01:00:00] that you have your holidays respected. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. Every holiday I got off. If I choose to work, if I got called out, it was time and 
a half. They knew they had to pay. If I choose to work All Year's Day, which was 
having a good time with my Caribbean folks, I knew that I was getting a half day

pay so I'm coming to look after your family. The Americans tell you they're going 
out, they'll be back late. Americans folks go out from eight till eleven. We start 
the fete [01:00:30] from one to four. So it works in my favor. I can work for you. 
Americans ... At the time, right? We say in Trinidad any time is Trinidad time. 
We work, they say come from eight, when you look so, they come back at 11 or 
before 11 o'clock. So I didn't mind working for $100 for that night ... Listen to 
[01:01:00] me. Working that hour. But also going to that job, but able to reach 
back to go to [inaudible 01:01:11] to go to party. So it goes in my favor.  
 
From 2007 to now, it has worked really well. In terms of respecting holidays and 
being paid for it, I must say. 
Pat Francois: 
[01:01:30] Let me ask you, would you say that you or any worker, that you know 
has been exploited due to immigration status? 
Christine Lewis: 
Oh you hear it a lot. A lot. I know of people who, people with children who have 
been deported. Workers whose children have had to go back to Trinidad. 
Workers [01:02:00] who call me and say "Girl, they just catch my son. He like he 
wanted to go home. He was stealing something in some Home Depot, he take 
up something he had to go back." But a lot of workers ... This is what I say to 
workers. Immigration is usually not something we talk about. We don't make a 
tea conversation. This is about a work situation. Your employer have to know 
your status. It's about doing the right thing. A lot of employers hold it over their 
employees. [01:02:30] A lot of employers hold it over their employees, that 
you're undocumented. It's a form of intimidation. That has no conversation in 
work relation. If you're going to work for somebody. I've known a lot of folks 
who have been threatened by immigration status. I haven't been put in that 
position.  
 
But when you don' tell, how you say it in the Army? Don't tell don't know 
something like that, I might be [inaudible 01:02:58] a little wrong. But [01:03:00] 
they're not privy to that part of your life. That's your part of your life that you 
don't share. It's on you.  And that part of your life ... They hired you. They more 
... They have more problems than you, because they hired you if they know that 
you are undocumented. They hired you in the first place. So if we want to take it 
there we could go there together, because you hired me knowing that I'm 
undocumented. So you hired a worker, knowing that she's undocumented, and 
you want to threat now with legal [01:03:30] stuff? You're so wrong, and so out 
of order. Because you didn't pay tax for her either, and she has a case on you 
too. 
Pat Francois: 
That's another thing. That's another story we will discuss it another time. 
 
So here we go, are there relationships with previous children you have cared 
that are particularly memorable in good or bad kind [01:04:00] of way? 
Domestic Workers United

Christine Lewis: 
That's the joyous ... Listen they're like little ... They're seeds, right? And we're 
responsible for those seeds. Those seeds ... I feel emotional talking about that. 
Because here it is you're raising a race of children who are different from you, 
on many levels. [inaudible 01:04:21] they gravitate to you. Their mannerism 
becomes yours. Their style, remember I talk about the child who went to school 
in the bandanna? You never know she'd been [01:04:30] looking at me. The way 
I dress, I used to wear a million and one bracelets.  
 
So Chris, could we continue this conversation? Is there a way that we can 
continue this conversation? 
Chris: 
Yeah, do you want to just finish this answer? And then we'll do it another time, 
do the rest of it. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. 
Chris: 
But to be honest, the way you asked the question is you did answer a lot of, the 
next section. The next section talks about work conditions outside the home. 
This is like a good lesson [01:05:00] of, as you do these interviews more you'll be 
like "By accident, without me asking, she talked about work outside the home." 
So, eventually you get to the point to be like "You know what, I don't have to 
ask that question." But again, when you did that, you did re-ask a question and 
it pulled in a whole nother story, which is interesting too. But that's the thing. 
 
But why don't you finish answering this question, and then we'll let you guys go 
[crosstalk 01:05:27] 
Pat Francois: 
[crosstalk 01:05:28] 
Christine Lewis: 
And that's the good thing about [01:05:30] it. 
 
After two. 
 
So when she pulls from me, when you hear what I say you still could pull from 
me and extract, that's what it is. 
Chris: 
Yeah, it wasn't for me, because I was like "Oh she probably doesn't need to ask 
that question" But you asked the source of tension question. She answered that 
question, then you asked her again later, and you pulled out something else that 
was really interesting. It was kind of good, it was really good. 
 
So if you just finish talking about the- 
Pat Francois: 
So about your relationships with previous children. 
Christine Lewis: 
Yes. So we are responsible for these [01:06:00] little seedlings, I call them 
saplings. We are the first caretakers they see, apart from their parents.

Pat Francois: 
First thing in the morning, last thing in the evening. 
Christine Lewis: 
And it's our inflections that they see. Our food, our songs. When the kids could 
call me and invite me to , hello, and invite me their graduation. It means a lot. 
When they could call me and say, at 16 or 17, and include me at their birthday 
parties it means a lot. Because we could forget. [01:06:30] We say it's a job, we 
say "Listen these people go back to their lives. Who the hell you are? They won't 
remember you." It's not true. It's true and not true. Hey, they may not know 
your name. They had babysitters who are grow older now. Who still take care ... 
I talking about women in their 60's who taking care of their charges children. 
The children that they take care of. Who are taking care of ... Like Isabella and 
Theo? I can see myself taking care [01:07:00] of their children, the relationships 
we have are so close.  
 
The recognition that we're different, we're black and white. They never use 
racism, they knew that we're people. When I look at the children I take care of 
when I go to the playground with them, cross the boundaries to play with kids 
that didn't look like them. It's a reflection of us that we bring to the table. They 
didn't look at white kids and play with white kids. I look at the kids I took care 
of, all of them, who went to play with other races of children. I said "Wow, 
[01:07:30] kids [foreign language 01:07:29]" That's a joie de vivre. 
 
I remember when I bring my daughter to work. Jamie was six Alex would have 
been about three, or two. He loved Jamie. Jamie was like his big sister. And they 
were hand in had, he would send gifts. And he loved her. I would bring ... My 
first job, in as much as I didn't get much pay. [01:08:00] Su casa was mi casa. 
Every party I used to bring people into people house. Jenny used to say to me 
"Christine, invite everybody over." I cooking food and everybody coming to eat 
[inaudible 01:08:11] foot and table and chair in that house. 
 
The next job I got after Jenny the woman tell me "Don't bring nobody in the 
house." Now I came from a place ... Funny enough, even though my pay was 
short on that first job, there was a laxity I had at that job. A Comfortableness. 
Alex would call me [01:08:30] and say "Will you take me to lunch." I remember 
meeting that alex for lunch. He was age 20 something and say to me "Christine, 
this is my life now. I go to Hamilton upstate." That's old money, it's a old college, 
a prestigious college where the parents old money pay for that college. He's on 
the student body for the lesbian and gay rights. He could told me these things 
freely with me.  
 
And have these grown children talk to me. Oh my God, it's so fulfilling. We don't 
see [01:09:00] ... Hey, we finish this part of this conversation when we see each 
other. 
Chris: 
That was great. That was really great. How'd you feel about that? 
Christine Lewis: 
Good

Pat Francois: 
Good 
Christine Lewis: 
We'll revisit this question when we see- 
Chris: 
That's a huge question and it sounds like you have a family here, that you take 
...  That connection between your family and this this family is very important. 
You did a great job. 
Christine Lewis: 
Very important. 
Chris: 
Wonderful interviewer. Great, great. You guys are too much the same. 
Pat Francois: 
[crosstalk 01:09:23] 
Christine Lewis: 
That's why we like it ... That's right. That's why this is a good project! 
Chris: 
But it's good. It's great because we'll learn [01:09:30] how to ... Because 
sometimes you're going to want people to give specifics. You're going to have to 
push people to say-
