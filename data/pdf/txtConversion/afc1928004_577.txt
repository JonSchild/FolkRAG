BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 
OF 
FLYNN & EUSON. 
With pleasure we state that both Messrs Flynn and 
Euson were born in the city of Troy, N. Y. in the 
years 1855 and 1856, 
so at the present time both 
gentlemen are in the prime of vigorous manhood, 
From their earliest childhood singing and dancing 
appeared to come to them as a 
gift of nature. 
Young 
in years they entered upon the profession they have 
ever embehshed with their genius. They made excur-
sion traveling tours through the old and new -world. 
In September 1877, they joined Cooper & Bailey, in 
allied shows, crossing the continent, sailing from 
Sanfrancisco to Australia. 
Stopping at all the prin-
ciple cities on the route. 
From then to India, New 
Zealand, Peru, Chili, and Brazil. 
Efter:traveling 
around nearly two years, meeting with great success, 
in all the principle cities. 
They returned to this 
country, and have since been playing in all the lead-
ing theatres of the States. 
And to- day, they rank 
among the best in their profession. 
Messrs Flynn & 
Euson are undeniably the people's favorites, and the 
stars of stars, 
in the 
cw-4telatioos of vtcriety 
per-
formers. 
They have worked hard to attain 
their 
celebrity, and its consequent popular favor. 
They 
have deserved it, for they had earned it, 
and never-
theless, they conceive it to be their bounded duty to 
advance in the art of pleasing, as the debt they owe 
to a 
generous public 
BY BID EUSON. 
SUNG BY FLYNN & BMX, 
IN THEIR IRISH SPECIALTIES. 
We'll tell you of a 
ball, dear folks, 
It was a 
grand affair; 
And all the aristocrats of Hoboken were there, 
They dressed in coats with swallow tails, 
The ladies one and all, 
They wore their satin slippers, 
At licSweeney's full dress ball. 
CHORUS. 
Hands all around, boys, 
. And then comes forward four, 
Next is ladies change, 
You'll hear them call. 
Balance to your partners, 
Double swing, and that was all, 
We ate oysters at 
MeSweeney's full dress ball. 
We danced the schottische, hands all round, 
And balance down the middle, 
The boys and girls they all kept time, 
To Casey's eight day fiddle. 
At twelve o'clock the gentlemen, 
Took partners one and all, 
To enjoy a 
pleasant supper at 
Mcf3weeney's full dress ball. 
BY SID EUSON, 
SUNG BY FLYNN k EUSON. 
Ladies and gentlemen, every one, 
Just listen to us for a 
while; 
-We're not like the young folks 
That run about now, 
And put on such great lots of style, 
We were born in old Ireland, 
That gay little land. 
We've seen the best days of our life, 
You never will find a 
happier pair 
Than Mr. O'Riley and wife. 
Crionus. 
Oh! we're the O'Riley's-
Yes the O'Riley's; 
We sing and we dance, 
And what funny things we do, 
We're the 0 
Rileys, 
Yes, the O'Rileys; 
We're old, but you bet, 
That we feel young as you. 
To-morrow will be O'Riley's birth day, 
I'm happy as happy can be; 
HE. 
And you my dear wife, 
Are the joy of my life, 
And together we always agree, 
He's always worked hard in every way, 
To make me enjoy all my life. 
And when will you find a 
pleasenter face, 
Than that of O'Riley's wife.

'We are a 
happy Irish pair, 
We'd like you all to knov, ; 
We arrived in this country 
A 
few days ago, 
We're looking for our daughter, 
Mary Ann it is her name, 
They say she's in a 
circus, 
By the naine of Susan 
C

But our daughter Mary Ann she's a 
darling. 
She's a 
daisy all the same, 
And whenever she goes out, 
Why the people they will shout 
There is Mary Ann McGuffin Susan Jane. 
Our Mary Ann's a 
beauty, 
Her hair is very red; 
She looks three `ways for Sunday, 
One look would kill you dead. 
Alth ,,ugh she's with a 
circus, 
Rides the elephant round the ring, 
She goes up on a 
trapeze, 
For to do a 
highland fling.

Can live well with a

We're working hard, now understand, 
And never mix in fights,

And bedad we want ouz rights.

The other night at Pagan's house. 
We had a 
rattling dance; 
The fun would set you crazy, 
It would put you in a 
trance. 
McCarthy with his fiddle, 
Played music that was grand, 
His jigs and reels could not be beat, 
By Gilmore's famous band. 
CHORUS. 
The McCarthy's and the Clancys 
In style did lively prance; 
But we nearly paralyzed them all, 
At Fagan's ,social dance. 
So now kind friends, u:; you can see, 
We are a 
happy pair; 
We always like to sing and dance, 
When we have time to spare. 
And now we'll bid you all good-bye, 
With permission we'll depart; 
To come around to sing and dance 
For you some other night,

WANDERING EMIGRANTS." 
When W9 were at home, 
Shure the boys they all did laugh at us, 
And say we were the prettiest couple, 
That ever left the bogs. 
But now we're far away in the wilds of America. 
And we don't know where we have to go, 
Or we can't get nothing to do. 
CHORUS. 
Our name it is McCarthy, 
And we would have you all to know, 
That we were born in Ireland, 
Near the town of Balinaslow. 
But now we're going home again, 
To that good old Irish country, 
When all the boys and girls 
They will welcome tis home again. 
We will go and see Red Barney, Long Teddy, 
And bold Irish Pat, 
And tell them of the men in Amerikay, 
That we would tell them to shoot their hat&

We're happy as happy can be; 
When bard times comes, now for that we don't care, 
As you can plainly see. 
sz—I'm seventy-nine, 
nail And I'm sixty-three. 
And to please everybody we strive, 
But we'd like to see the old sun of a 
gun, 
That would bother old Mullen and wife. 
CHORUS. 
We're old Mr. Mullen and wife, 
We're old Mr. Mullen and wife, 
As we go out each day, 
All the young people say, 
There goes old Mr. Mullen and wife. 
To-morrow our Katie united will be, 
I'll bet you the wedding will be grand, 
It puts me in mind of the day my dear wife, 
When first I 
asked you for your hand. 
How happy were we, well they'll jist be the same, 
We hope so, for all of their lives; 
But I'll bet you they never will play the same game, 
Like old Mr. Mullen and wife.

If you'll keep your seats awhile, 
We will try to show to you, 
When we are on parade, 
What marching we can do.

Or the 011oolahan Musketeers, 
And when we pass Mulcahey's house, 
We give three hearty &leers.

ADILENE. 
DED. TO LILLIE BELE/WM 
I'm infatuated with a 
little maiden, 
I 
scarce know what to do or what to say; 
When I 
met her 'twits early in the evening, 
She's as beautiful as flowers that bloom in May. 
As she passed she smiled, 
And then I 
asked permission, 
To walk along to pass away the time, 
Of love we talked, to me it was so pleasing. 
Then I 
asked this little maiden to be mine. 
CHORUS. 
Her style and ways are so complete, (Break.) 
With pretty tiny feet; (Break.) 
Oh! there's none that can compare 
With her for beauty, 
I 
think she said her age was seventeen; 
I'll be married when the autumn leaves are falling 
To my pretty captivating Adilene, 
At her house I 
visit every Sunday evening. 
To talk of happy times that are in store; 
For Adilene and I 
when we are married, 
We'll dwell in joy and peace forever more. 
How I 
long to bear the marriags bells a 
ringing. 
It will be the happiest moments of my life; 
When to church I 
take this pretty maiden, 
And forever we are joined as man and wife..

In eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out;

Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight, 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
CHORUS. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found one enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
Bo now me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman,

Ther'es a 
dear spot of land far out on the ocean, 
The prettiest island that ever was seen; 
There's no place on earth that ac well suits 
my notion, 
It's the Emerald isle where the shamrock is green, 
Alas! the bold tyrant has taken possession. 
And driven our daughters and eons to exile, 
For no one could stand their tyrauic aggression, 
And banished are we from the Emerald Isle. 
CHoRDS. 
Then its God speed the day that will dawn with 
our freedom. 
When the stars and the harp shall be blended as one, 
Then the poor of mild Ireland will need no help 
to feed them, 
They'll belong to the country of brave Washington. 
When I 
left my dear home my poor heart was 
breaking„ 
Oh ! ' tis a 
sad moment the peirting of friends, 
The tear-be-dimed eyes, and the honest 
hand-shaking, 
Oh 
that carisr.s the stoutest of hearts to- unbend, 
But there are occasions when parting.; a 
pleasure, 
And one is in (Tossing the beautiful sea; 
Where toil is rewarded 1) 
friendship and treasure. 
In the home of the brave and the land of tht tree.

Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride,

And its happy we will be in that dear land ot the freq

I 
would go with you, Barney darling, 
But the reason why 1

It would break my poor mother's heart if 
from her i 
had to part. 
And go roaming with you, Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, &a. 
I 
am going far away, Norah darling, 
Just as sure as there's a 
God I 
adore; 
But remember ,. hat I 
say; that until the 
judgement day, 
You will never see your Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, &O.

would go-with you, Barney darling, 
II my mother and the rest of them were there, 
For I 
know we wo..ld be blest in that dear land 
of the West, 
living happy with your Barney Mee* 
Then come to my arms, a.a, 
I 
am going far away, Norah Darling,

PAT MAY B'•' FO3LISH, 
CORRECT RRITION. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
. 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
Cnortus. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
NCH got a 
temper that don't last-very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears. 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Chora_ 
Rem.tmber the Celts and the Suxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country or queen, 
Chorus. 
I've a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. - 
Och ! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
Anu as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
33boys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you dcn't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk. 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare. 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, " my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost. 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus, 
my eyes, 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now. 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointing me onto 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus.

I'm a 
true-hearted boy from the green shores of Erin, 
That" Emerald " set in the sea, 
Where bounteous nature her best cloth appear in; 
And choicest of gifts scatters free. 
Our mountains and valleys with produce abounding, 
.Our rivers and lakes tilled with life galore, 
Loveliest so.n.s 
sides there surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, otdd Ireland asthore. 
CHORUS. 
Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar, 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Dear Grannuail thy daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in swan. 
Our hearts ever open to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turned from the door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore. 
Chorus. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud boys to wear it 
To it I'll ever be true, 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply indeed as I 
do. 
Distance or climate that bond cannot sevea, 
Firm in our hearts all the wide world o'es, 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it no never; 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore.

There are songs unsung in every heart, 
Some beautiful memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting place, 
By sorrow and tear- drops hidden, 
Some sad, sad hope, that once did bloom, 
When life was gay and young, 
But now it is faded and withered and dead, 
Oh beautiful songs unsung. 
CHORUS. 
Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh! nestle alone in thy secret place. 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold, 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish, 
Tho' some are sombre, and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the sad lened they're clung, 
They are set in tears, and never can die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
Chorus. 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love, 
That in kindness and truth were spoken. 
But now are the links of a 
glad wild dream, 
Cherished and loved yet broken. 
And, oh! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kiss'd by &lath. 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung.

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
WRiriZN AND SUNG BY FRANZ LW& 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long. 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
Cnonus. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
to yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh I 
don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus. 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and Mak 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus. 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song. 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on'Sunday night.

LOVE IT AM A

Oh! love it is such a 
very funny thing, 
It catches the young and the old, 
It's just like a 
plate of boarding-house hash, 
For many's the man's been sold. 
It will make you feel like a 
fresh-water eel, 
It will cause your heart for to swell, 
You may love your wife as you do your life, 
But ' twill empty your pocket-book as well. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You will find when you're wed, they'll bang 
you till you're dead, 
With the bawld-headed end of a 
broom. 
When a 
man's.in love with a 
pretty little girl, 
lie talks as gentle as a 
dove, 
lie calls her his honey, and he spends lots of money, 
For to show her he's solid in love. 
When his money's all gone, and his clothes up 
the spout, 
lie will find the old saying true, 
That a 
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, 
What the deuce is a 
fellow going to do. 
With a 
wife and fourteen half-starved kids, 
And tell you it ain't no fun, 
When the butcher comes around to collect his bills, 
With a 
dog and a 
double barrelled gun. 
So boys, keep away from the girls, I 
say, 
And give them plenty of room, 
You'll think you are in clover, till the honey-
moon is OTOT, 
And then you will wish you were dead. 
With a 
cross-eyed baby on each knee, 
With a 
wife with a 
wart on her nose, 
You will find that love don't run so smooth, 
When you have to wear your second-hand clothes, 
When the rents are high the kids will cry, 
Kase they ain't got nothing for to chaw, 
You'll holler for your son to load up the gun, 
For to vaccinate your mother-in-law. 
warrrzN AND BUNG BY FRANK LIIIL 
We all have our shares of ups and downs 
, In every rank and station; 
We are sure to get more kicks and. frowns, 
If we depend on kind relations'. 
It's all very well once or twice to drop in, 
And ask for a 
lit le in favor, 
13nt if by chance you go a 
third time, 
They'll construe it to your bad behavior 
CHORUS. 
So my advice take one and all, 
In every rank and station, 
And if you want a 
favor done, 
Don't go to your relations. 
speak from experience, and some you'll find 
How often they'll invite you, 
But when poverty comes close behind, 
They will soon begin to slight you. 
It's clear away, there's a 
knock at the door, 
Don't open the door too wide John, 
I'm afraid it's that hungry brother of mine, 
Say I'm gone out for a 
ride, John. 
Chorug. 
I 
thought my sister would prove a 
friend, 
But soon she did deceive me, 
She said these times were not times to lend, 
She would if she could relieve me, 
A 
trifle sister, would keep me afloat.. 
I 
shall sink if you don't arrange it. 
She said she'd no less than a 
live dollar note, 
And she hadn't time to change it. 
Chorus 
I 
lost my goods but found that day, 
Though against me they had sinned all; 
Death called a 
rich old friend of mine, 
Who left me a 
handsome wind-fall. 
Mut how they altered what they said, 
Their ways were so provoking, 
To hear them say as they hung their heads, 
Why Frank we were only joking. 
Chorus. 
There is none in this world so blessed as_I, 
With so many kind relations, 
,I am invited to breakfast, dinner, and tea, 
I've a 
hundred invitations. 
I 
refuse them all though my heart it burns, 
Their friendship I 
don't heed it, 
For I 
hate the cold heart that in poverty spurns,

As we walk thro' the streets how often we meet, 
Some poor old man who's life is naught but ,woe; 
With age his form is bent, in his pockets not a 
cent, 
And for shelter he Lestows not where to go. 
With relations by the score who drive him from the doot 
And meet him on the street they pass him by, 
If you ask him why it's done, he will answer 
you and say, 
I 
am poor and old and only in the way. 
&onus. 
Bo let us cheer them on, they won't be with us long. 
Don't let us sneer because they're old and gray; 
And remember while we are young the days to 
us may COMe, 
When we'll be old and only in the way. 
There was a 
time I 
hear when the young were 
not so queer, 
But since that time there's came an awful change, 
Young men in health and might, their old 
parents they will strike, 
It happens every day, it's nothing strange. 
When he his bread can't earn, his children do 
him spurs 
For death I 
am sure he oftentimes does pray, 
Himself and faithful wife after toiling all their life, 
When old they find they're only in the way. 
Chi, 
My little song I'm sure is for rich as well as poor, 
For take a 
rich man when he's growing old, 
His friends will shake his band, his relations 
round him stand, 
Awaiting for him to die they want his gold. 
Then let us from this hour, do all that's in our power, 
To make the road for the old folks light and gay, 
And if they trouble on us cast, why let us be the last, 
To say when old that they are only in the way. t

That was afore I

Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from 
near and far, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'em suited her, 
'There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
lie was the man for Nellie— she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know

Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
Re was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing. 
Ile'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink. 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glass, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way,

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS Wrrx.vals. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and. 
slow. 
At the crowded crossing she vatited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout. 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery street 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
"I'll help you across if you wish to go?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
"She's somebody's mother, boys, you know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother—you understand! 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away.'. 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her head.

Who shall judge a 
man from nature, 
Who shall know him by his dress; 
Paupers may be fit for princes, 
Princes fit for something less. 
Crumpled shirt, and dirty jacket, 
May beclothe both you and me, 
8o with your lot try be contented, 
As the Pebbles in the sea. 
There are springs of crystal nectar, 
Ever swelling out of stone, 
There are purple buds and golden, 
Hidden, crushed, and overgrown; 
God who counts by souls, not dressesb 
Loves and prospers you and me; 
While He values thrones the highesl. 
But as Pebbles in the sea. 
There are foam embroidered oceans, 
There are little weed clad rills, 
There are feeble inch high saplings, 
There are cedars on the hills. 
God who counts by souls, not statiOla 
Loves and prospers you and me, 
For to Him all vain distinctions 
Are as Pebbles in the sea. 
Truth and justice, are eternal, 
Born with loveliness and light; 
Secret wrong shall never prosper, 
While there is a 
starry night. 
God whose world-heard voice is Pinging; 
Boundless love to you and me, 
sinks oppression with its titles, 
As the-Pebbles in the ese. 
THE DYING MINSTREL 
COMPOSED AND RECITED BY WALTER MACK. 
Copyright 1881 by Mrs. Pauline Lieder. 
The curtain is up on the last act brother, 
I'm dying, I 
feel it here; 
We've had many a 
jaunt together, dear boy, 
But my next jaunt will be on a 
bier. 
Do you remember the night we opened in York, 
'Tis twelve years now or more; 
It was then I 
first saw her angel face, 
Since then my poor heart has grown sore. 
The overture passed off nightly, 
And our jokes were spicy and new, 
But I 
stuck that night in my end song, 
For her eyes seemed to pierce me through; 
I 
was not in the after piece, so when I'd finished 
; 
I 
washed up and went out in front, (my 
dance 
To see if I 
could again catch that glance, 
Well it was the same old story; 
You've been there I 
know it, dear boy, 
But you were accepted and happy, 
While I 
was forbidden that joy. 
A 
father, in the case 
I 
should say so," 
Be called me a 
worthless adventurer, 
Said his daughter was high in the world, 
I 
only a 
poor nigger singer with unknown connectioner 
Well, perhaps he was right, brother, 
But God will not make that distinction, 
I 
might have played the roll of Othello, 
Extolled my virtues and with eloquence won, 
But I 
did not tell that I 
once belonged to the ton. 
Raise the pillow a 
little higher, brother, 
That's better, I 
breath with more ease, 
I'm almost glad death is so near, 
I 
almost welcome disease; 
Shakespeare says the whole world's a 
stage, 
I 
hope I've played my part well. 
The exit is near, the curtain is falling, 
I 
hear the prompters last bell, 
Only a 
nigger minstrel, 
Oh! how the words grate on my ear; 
Will the angels say them, too, and— 
For my sins not drop one tear; 
No, I'm sure they will not, 
I 
feel it here in my heart; 
I 
shall there meet my old friends, 
'The minstrel boys ne'er again will pm* 
THE MAN THAT LIVES OVER MY HEAD 
RECITATION. 
" 
BY WM. ELiRDMAN. 
copyright lea by Mrs. Pauline Lieder. 
I'm not nuch at singin' or makin' a 
speech, 
But seeing your faces so gay; 
And being requested I'll do what I 
can 
Before I 
have gone on me way. _ 
Of where I 
am livin' I'm goin' to speak, 
Or rather a 
neighbor instid; 
Who has the whole house in a 
terrible state, 
The man that lives over me head. 
I'm told that he sings for a 
livin' at night, 
In a 
big free and easy up town, 
To see him come home. I've watched many times, 
But always give up wid a 
frown, 
At three in the morning surrounded by friends, 
As weary I 
roll in me bed, 
He'll stand near the windee and bawl like a 
cow, 
The man that lives over me head. 
Last night the whole house it was filled full 
of smoke, 
I 
jumped from my bed like a 
deer; 
And found that the ten cuts were runnin' about, 
And raisin' the divil wid fear. 
I 
took matters easy and searched for the fire. 
Along wid a 
friend they call Red, 
And what do you think sure he upset the stots, 
The man that lives over mu head. 
flat MAN THAT LIVES OVER MY HEAD, 
He'll take off his boots and he'll give them a 
tom. 
That makes me jump out of me chair; 
Be grunts and he snores like- a 
pig in his sleeiN 
,And sober he's never I 
swear. 
He goes up the stairs like a 
horse wid a 
oart, 
On pisin he ought to be fed; 
tie dances and pounds wid his fist on the floor, 
The man that lives over me head. 
it times in the middle of night he will blow, 
Upon a 
cornet that he plays; 
nu the neighbors awakened will hang 
round the door, 
And swear in a 
great many ways. 
the house it well knows when he's home so it does, 
Some day he'll be found lyin' deed, 
There's twenty-five families that owe him a 
gradgo, 
The man that lives over me head. 
The neighbors and I 
to the landlord have been, 
He don't seem to mind us at all; 
He says we're excited wid nothin' to fear, 
And takes the whole thing very small, 
If he don't drive that divil froin out of the house, 
To give us some comfort insticl, 
flome night in his shirt-tail we'll run him a 
block, 
The man that lives over me head. 
WHEN I 
SMOKED MY FIRST CIGAR. 
COMPOSED AND EXCITED ET WALTElt WA= 
Copyright iSsi by Mrs. Pauline Lieder. 
It was just behind the woodshed. 
One glorious summer day; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking atm 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
From all earth's confusion, 
.1 smoked ray first cigar. 
Lii 1 
bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was light. 
The woodshed round me flew, 
Dark night closed in around me, 
Rayless without a 
star, 
Grim death I 
thought I 
had fowl& 
When I 
smoked my first cigar. 
I 
heard my fathers smothered laugh. 
It seemed so strange and far; 
knew he knew, I 
knew he knew, 
ra smoked my first cigar,

There's a 
happy little cot down in southern Tennessee, 
• 
Where the ivy blossoms twine round the door, 
And forever fresh and green in my memory it will be, 
Enough I 
know I'll never see it any more; 
But I 
never can forget the old home I 
love so well, 
And the many good old tunes that I 
have sung, 
And the tears they fill my eyes every time I 
try to tell 
Of the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
CHORUS. 
Now the tambo and the bones, am forever laid away, 
The fiddle and the banjo am unstrung; 
But I 
often heave a 
sigh for the happy days gone by, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow corn, 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
&.nd before they made me free I 
had never cause 
to mourn; 
And around the old place everything was gay; 
And many and many a 
time when.the work of 
day was over, 
With my melody the old plantation rung, 
1.nd my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore, 
And the times I 
used to have when I 
was young. 
Now the tambo, &o.

like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear; 
Yet. 'tis better to know you're prepared for the worst, 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
CHORUS. 
I 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
I 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
I 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none; 
Hard words may be.used, but I 
like him the most. 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
It' wrong I 
can cure the foul slander ot once, 
And destroy every venomous part; 
Yet I 
reel, when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
Chorug.. 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
If you can't do him no good, do him no harm; 
If you don't like backbiting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm 
'We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A 
good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint 'gainst a 
man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face. _ M OMS.

ONLY THE WAY ON THE STAGE, 
By Fred J. Mackley. 
Sung by Henry Graham. 
IT you 
listen to me some facts I 
will mention, 
Oore,rning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to You I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage. 
Ca!tii., 
to thia City with me er two friends, 
And went for a 
str JI, the.y seeme.t quite amazed, 
WI a 
Wt read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
The ast scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a [eau- xvoinan begging, she quiet old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed b, , his face seemed in smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this taror wretched woman, 
But twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room. 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man by the people respected. 
And the court room WEIR crowded with people so glad, 
To vee that lean punished for the crime he committed, 
The jury .10okt d 
stsrn, end the judge in a 
rage, 
. And they hung that rich loan f the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it wa$ played on the stage. 
In the nexr scene I 
saw a 
c'ergyman from Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage. 
Another one foat 
Jersey Wati playing the vioin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed. 
For jrst at that minute a 
party mimed Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine aertnon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that that they practiced each 
sermon they preasha4, 
Hat it was only the w.ty it wile played on the stage.

And drives massa from his home.

On de lubly Ohio; 
And den ole massa heeled it, 
From de mighty Northern foe.

I 
lived in old Kentucky, 
When our massa ran away, 
And left his darkies lonely, 
On de niancipation day. 
I 
see de soldiers comin', 
And they told me I 
was free, 
I 
blessed the flag they carried, 
On that morn of jubilee.

For old massa good and kind, 
Who ran away and left his 
Poor old darkeys all behind.

The times are getting shakey, 
And my poor old heart is sore; 
While in de cotton picking, 
These old hands will work no more. 
When massa left me lonely, 
As de Linkurn gunboats come, 
I 
moved from old Kentucky, 
But I 
find no place like home.

One day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man was sad. tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief I 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
Said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
CHORUS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raise, 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the me; 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak, 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae 
ChonW 
My wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we go, 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
tart husband from wife, to be paupers for life, 
That's how you get served when you're old.
