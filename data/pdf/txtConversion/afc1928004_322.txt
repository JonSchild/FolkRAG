OPINIONS OF THE PRESS, 
TONY PASTOR'S OPERA HOUSE. 
NILES & EVANS, who made their metropolitan debut, per-
formed songs and dances in white faces which were meritori-
ous and pleasing. 
They represented a 
male and female, and 
were richly and tastefully costumed. 
The one representing the 
female character has been endowed by nature with features of 
a 
decidedly feminine cast, indicative of culture and refinement. 
and his make-up, voice, gestures and movements were so thor-
oughly in keeping with the character assumed that the illusion 
was so perfect that one could not but believe that it was a 
lady 
and not a 
gentleman who was performing. — New York Clipper. 
THE METROPOLITAN, BROADWAY, NEW YORK. 
NILES & EVANS were added to the troupe at the Metropolitan,

NILES & EVANS as Dialogue Artists rank among the best in 
their line in the profession, and their performances are received 
with great favor.—Pitts. Carr., New York Clipper.

J. 
FISEIER, 98 Nassau Street, New York 
First Swell, 
Oh what a 
shocking plight, I 
was placed in Sunday night, 
Just listen to me now, and I 
will tell : 
I 
was sitting by the side of her that was to be my bride, 
When in came a 
gallus colored swell. 
He came up to me, and spoke with perfect candor, 
And swore he'd wed my own, my sweet Amanda, 
And that if Pd interfere, he would stand me on my ear, 
But I'm sure that she loves none else but me. 
{Dance and exit. 
Second 
Ah! this must be the street where they say he comes to meet 
Nearly every night, at eight, my own beloved. 
Now if this Nig. I 
see, I'll shoot him or he'll shoot me, 
And I'll make his nose look like a 
boxing glove. 
Then I'll marry her, my beautiful Amanda, 
We'll pack our duds and go to Indiana: 
Then if we don't agree, a 
divorce will set me free, 
And back I'll come to win another girl. 
Dance—enter 1st swell. 
Second Swell. 
Ha! Ha! we meet at last. Now to you do I 
request, 
That you, to me your claim on her give over. 
First Swell. 
No, no, I'll never yeild if I 
have to take the field, 
And my claret must be spilt upon the clover. 
Spoken.—Nay, nay, kind Rudolph, I 
will not give up the guyrl. 
Second Swell. 
Then, by Heaven's, you die at early candle light, to-morrow 
at noon. 
First Swell. 
But the young lady loves me the best, because I 
received 
a 
Billy Ducks from her a 
few moments ago. 
Second Swell. 
Oh I 
you mean a 
billet doux. 
Well, that's funny, I 
got one 
myself which I 
hav'nt had time to read.

Fiist 
Well, I'll read mine rigid in front of you to show how I 
stand 
with Amanda. (Opens envelope and reads.) 
Mr. Duplex— 
Dear Sir: 
It would give me great pleasure never to 
see your ugly face again, and if you ever show your monkey 
form at our domicile I'll have you saluted with a 
stuff club. 
Yours in disgust, 
AMANDA. 
Oh! this is too much. 
Second Swell. 
Well, I'm sorry for yon, my friend, but none but the brave 
deserve the fair. 
Listen to what she says. (Opens envelope 
and reads.) 
Mr. Oliver Lush— 
Dear Sir: 
I 
would like to see you, no more, 
and a 
you present yourself to my residence again I 
will have 
you arrested for arsenic. 
Yours, etc. 
P. S.--I'm to be married to Billy, the Butcher, at 9 
o'clock 
to-morrow. 
Oh! Gus, console me.

Oh, she always seemed to me to Le so honest.

ABOUT THE HOUR OF THREE, 
Character Song and Dance, witten by Jas. NILES. 
He. 
There's a 
roguish little belle that always comes this way, 
And I 
think its very likely that I'll meet her here to-day; 
She's the sweetest little nymph that ever you did see, 
And she's sure to pass this way about the hour of three. 
She dresses so exquisite this darling little mix, 
Her shoes are number three, her gloves are number six. 
I 
spoke to her one eve as I 
was rambling out, 
She smiled and showed her pretty teeth, 
In a 
most bewitching mouth. 
CHORUS. 
She's sweeter than a 
peach, I 
wish you all to know, 
We first met on the avenue, about two weeks ago; 
She's a 
handsome little belle in that you'll all 
gree, 
She's always sure to pass this way about the hour of thre*. 
I 
see the little charmer coming down the street, 
I 
wonder will she angry oc if to her I 
speak, 
will linger near and wait a 
little while, 
And should she recognize me 
I 
will bow to her and smile. 
She. 
Oh! there's that handsome fellow that I 
by chance did meet, 
Who spoke to me one evening, coming down the street, 
But I'm sure he don't remember, and has quite forgotten me, 
T'was just two weeks ago to day, and about the hour of 
three. 
She's sweeter, .te. 
He. 
Gooti evening Miss, how do you do? 
I've something sweet to say; 
I 
dare to ask your pardon 
For we've met before to-day. 
She. 
While strolling on the avenve 
About two weeks ago. 
I 
raised my hat. 
She. 
And you bowed to m 
He. 
I 
think you ought to know. 
She. 
I'm sure I 
never felt so happy in my life. 
He. 
Tnea I 
hope you won't refurse to be my little wife. 
She. 
Yon' ye Wo . my heart, and here's my hand 
Which I 
will give to thee. 
He. 
Then I'll ne're forget the day we met 
About the hour of three. 
She's sweeter, ke.

KALAMAZOO. 
Written by Jon Grucrc. 
Banjo solo sung by JAS. 'IMES. 
I'll sing you a 
song of a 
nice young girl, 
She is my 11,1'14 Flunky; 
She dresses in the fashion, 
And she wears a 
Number Two, 
Her feet art like canal boats, 
And her ears are loin ,- and slender; 
Her lather keeps a 
barber shop 
Way out in Kalamazoo, 
CHORUS. 
She's my Ono ing 7,lichigander— 
She's an . dab ster rose; 
Her ears • tre long, her voice is strong, 
She wears a 
Roman nose. 
She juggles the hash, she's on the mash 
M St every where she goes— 
She's my Kalamazan-go-zander, 
Kalamazander, Alabazan. 
Her name it is Lucinda Bell 
Gebutt Gehoshehopper; 
Her father's name is Jeboshifat, 
With my skimynnarinky day. 
She swears according to Hoyle, 
And you bet its hard to beat her— 
She can lather and shave an elephant's trunk, 
And chew hay like a 
cow. 
She's niy darlin 
Scc. 
She went out to join the circus, 
And she used to feed the monkeys, 
And clvan thehippopotamus, 
And she used to chew the glue. (Bang.) 
But the camel got his back up 
With a 
pair t 
f 
Barnum's donkeys, 
Chewed rp her shoes and stockings, 
With my Hoopdedoodendo. 
She's my darling, Arc.

Sensational Song and Dance, writter, and composed by NILEt: 
cia- EVANS. 
Copyright 1876, by A. J. Ristimit, 98 No.s:;azt Scree% New York. 
We're the boys (Sym) that makes the noise ‘Sym 
And we're just as full of fun as we can be (Sym‘!; 
When we go out, the people shout, 
There's two jolly boys who're out upon a , t».'ee, 
But you mus'nt think because we are not dressed so very 
neat 
That we can be taken in by each labcy sport we meet; 
For we're posted on the times, anawe ye always got the 
dimes, 
And now we're sure that with us you'll •igree. 
ClIORUS. 
That;we are two jolly boys, and we always make a 
noise, 
To let the people know that we are out; 
Oh, the ladies smile and say, ain't they handsome, ain't 
they gay, 
Especially when they throw their shoes anoat. 
I 
know a 
girl ( Sym) she's a 
pearl (Syin ), 
And she always dresses to the fasilion -pia te,—;Vni— 
'Twas in the park, just after dark, 
That I 
asked her if she'd let me 1:now my fate. 
She says you do not wear yourclothos 
According to the style. 
For you wear a 
dizzy coat, and an unbecoming style. 
But there's one thing that I'll choose, • 
And that's those Number Two's, 
But you'll have to change them for they're out of date. 
That we are two jolly boys, &c,.

SOUTH °ARLINE, 
Song and Dance, composed by JAs. NILES. 
Performed by NILES & EVANS with success. 
Oh, when we were two little boys 
Way down in South Carline; 
We used to sing and dance about, 
And with our hands keep time. 
But when we grew up igger 
We had to work all day, 
And then we never had a 
chance 
To fool around that way. 
CHORUS. 
But, Oh! my! when our work was done—Sym, 
Then was the time that we all went in for fun; 
We used to sing and dance about 
T,11 Massa made us run. 
[Dance. 
Dut now the times have changea you see, 
Down in our Sunnily Home; 
The Rebellion broke the country up, 
So now we have to roam, 
And what they want to do with us, 
We're sure we do not know, 
Unless to make us Senators 
To send to Idaho. 
But. Oh ! my. tto. 
SWEET POTTEEN. 
As sung in ED. HARRIGAN'S Irish drama "IASCAIRB," by HAW 
RICIAN and HART. 
Copyright 1876, by A. J. FISHER, 98 Nassau Street, New York. 
Sweet Potteen, you deceiver, 
I 
love you just as well, 
Since the day when first I 
met you, 
You threw o'er me a 
spell; 
You're winning, you're enticing, 
As soft as Asia silk, 
I 
love you, oh my darling, 
As the baby loves its milk. 
CHORUS. 
Then drink to your neighbors, 
Drink to your friends, 
The dew from the mountain stream; 
It once you took a 
drop, 
Upon my soulyou'd never stop, 
A 
drinking of the sweet potteen. 
Old Bacchus, you deluder, 
With all your coaxing ways, 
You've enslaved me liked a 
spider, 
When brought within my gaze; ! 
Wid whiskey I'm so frisky, 
From my head down to my toes, 
I'd praise you, oh my darling, 
To your friends or to your f 
Jes. 
Then drink to your, & c.

TWO DEVILS FROM BELOW, 
Composed and sung with great success by HARRY OSBORNE and 
FANNIE W ENTWORTH. 
W E 
are two funny characters, 
And the same you will allow, 
You will always find us tippling, 
And the last ones in a 
row: 
But when our Irish blood gets hot, 
And we pull the cobeen o'er our face. 
You hear them quickly calling out, 
Let them alone for they are no brace. 
CHORUS. 
We are two dacint people, 
We stand as straiL•;... and firrn 
As a 
wall or a 
church steeple 
That no one can overthrow: 
So we are known by every one 
As two devils from below. 
Sure we are in for every party. 
Raffles, fairs, or wakes, 
And if there's any one too hearty, 
You can bet their pie is baked: 
For people look and stare at us, 
And say do now squeel low, 
For there at McGuffin's party 
Goes, them devils from below. 
We are two, & c.

PRETTY LITTLE BLONDE, 
TURN DOWN THE GAS. 
Originally sung by VAGINIA STICKNEY. 
Why do the men try to deny, 
They love that pretty girl, 
And then if they do pass her by, 
Just to give their eye a 
twirl; 
They cannot help it no they can't, 
I 
judge them by myself, 
For when I 
met that girl to-day, 
You know how it is yourself. 
CHORUS. 
For oh, she was so handsome, 
And graceful as a 
fawn, 
How could I 
help but love that girl, 
With all those nice clothes on, 
And When she cast that smile on me, 
I 
knew that I 
was gone, 
For oh, she was so nobby, ha, ha, 
That pretty little blonde. 
I 
asked her if she'd walk with me, 
She smiled and answered yes, 
You should have seen me swell beside, 
That nobby, nice silk dress, 
I 
asked her if she liked ice cream 
To cool her blushing tongue, 
She said she thought t 
would taste nice, 
With all those fine clothes on. 
For oh she was, Le. 
or 
Words by the lovely Vocalist, JENNIE LINIPSAI. 
Dedicated to my friend HARRY BENNETT. 
You have all heard the song of Pull down the blind, 
But another I'll sing just as good, you will find; 
Now, Wipe off your chin, I 
believe is the last, 
But I 
have one still later, 'tis Turn down the gas! 
Now, I 
loved a 
young man so charming and gay, 
Who came round to see me most every day; 
When we'd kiss and embrace, to me he would say— 
Turn down the gas! Turn it down right away! 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he was a 
darling fellow; whenever he 
came to my house to see me, it was always when Pa and 
Ma were gone to meeting; he would put his arm round 
my neck and say, Jennie, darling— 
CHORI7S. 
Turn down the gas! Turn down the gas! 
Darken the room, love, there's a 
dear lass : 
Though we love each other, remarks may be pass'd, 
So come kiss your Harry and—Turn down the gas! 
My Harry's a 
darling, you can see at a 
glance, 
And don't he look sweet in his new lavender pants; 
He sings like a 
bird, and oh! can't he dance! 
If you saw him waltzing why you'd go in a 
trance, 
For such style as his was never seen yet— 
He's King of the Fashion, now don't you forget. 
We are going to be married, and I'll never regret 
When I 
turned down the gas for my dear darling pet. 
SPOKEN. — Harry and I 
have been keeping company for 
over a 
year, and mother says it's time he proposed. 
I 
think so too. 
He says he will marry me before the Cen-
tennial is over. 
At any rate, I 
hope he loves me just as 
well as when he first courted me, and with a loving 
squeeze told me to please— 
Turn down the gas !" &c.

THE WAY OF THE WORLD! 
Copyright by E. B. HARDING, 220 Bowery, N. Y., where the Music is 
to be had. 
Price 10 cents. 
Words by JOLLY NASH. 
Music by T. 
E. 
ELLORY. 
I've seen a 
great deal of the world in my time, 
I've mixed with the grave and the gay, 
And I've noted the ways of the poor, and the proud, 
As I've journey'd thro' life's rugged way ; 
I've seen a 
good man at a 
turn of the wheel, 
By dame fortune to poverty hurl'd, 
And I 
have seen those he fed in his prosperous days, 
Pass him by—that's the way of the world. 
CHORUS. 
Oh yes! it's the way of the world, my boys, 
It's the way of the world, you see ; 
Oh yes! it's the way of the world, my boys, 
But it is not the way with me. 
It's the way of the world to lavish its wealth 
On those who don't need it, we find ; 
To smile at the follies of those that are rich, 
And to their misdoings be blind; 
Should poverty err it is quite the reverse, 
The smiles are all changed into frowns; 
Your conduct will always be judged by your purse, 
You will find, in the world's ups and downs. 
Oh yes! it's the way, Ste. 
It's the way of the world to envy the man 
Who by his exertions may rise, 
And cant about luck, if he who have pluck, 
Succeed in the things that he tries ; 
Some people make mischief the rule of their lives— 
Keep the banner of discord unfurled— 
Make tools of the weak to gain their own ends, 
As they wriggle their way through the world. 
Oh yes ! it's the way, .ke. 
It's the way of a 
few in the world, I 
observe, 
To frown upon all who are gay; 
And pull a 
long face when innocent mirth 
Would chase the dull moment away; 
I 
have learnt some good lessons by what I 
have seen— 
It is better to laugh than to cry— 
That much good is mixed with the bad in the world, 
And each on himself should rely. 
CHORUS. 
I've shewn you the ways of the world, my boys, 
The ways of the world, you see; 
Take the good with the bad, together, my boys, 
That is the way with me.

If it's only for my sake, 
For you know, if you were to leave me now 
Poor Paj.d.y's heart would break. 
M OLLIE. — Now Pat, you divil, just listen here, 
To what I'm saying to you; 
You know if you court that Kitty from Cork, 
To me you can't be true.

Then you will be my wife.

When you become my bride.

When you are by my side.

SWEET HAPPY DAYS. 
Words and Music by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
Oh! I 
never shall forget the happy days, 
Happy days! Happy days! 
When upon the old plantation, 
All the darkies took vacation, 
And they left their heavy work 
And went to play. 
Then we took the banjo, fiddle and the bones, 
And the bones! And the bones! 
And you ought to hear the ringing, 
Of the merry voices singing, 
In the chorus of the dulcimatic tones, 
CHORUS. 
Oh! happy days! sweet happy days! 
When we took the banjo, fiddle and the bones, 
And the bones! And the bones! 
Yes, you ought to hear the ringing, 
Of the merry voic,es singing, 
In the chorus of the dulcimatic tones. 
Oh ! I 
never shall forget Miss Susie Brown, 
Susie Brown! Susie Brown! 
Yes, the beauty of her mouth, 
Was a 
picture of the South. 
And they say she was " the Belle of all the town." 
We used to be together all the while, 
All the while! All the while! 
And she looked so very charming, 
That I 
could'nt see the harm, in 
A 
kissing her until I 
made her smile. 
THE BROADWAY SWELL. 
Composed and Sung by the Celebrated Swell Singer, 
MR. HARRY BELL. 
I 
guess you'll wonder who I 
am, 
But listen and I'll tell; 
Wherever I 
go, they tell me so, 
Tbat I'm a 
Broadway swell! 
In a 
I -aggy, through the town I 
drive, 
That you must know full well; 
And you know drinking, that's my style, 
Of this, the Broadway Swell ! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I 
am a 
Swell, you all know well 
The dashing figure of this young swell 
If you don't know, the girls will tell, 
That I 
am called a 
Broadway Swell! 
While walking out the other day, 
A 
nice young girl to see, 
I 
met her at the Central Park, 
And she vowed that she loved me; 
I 
guess you'll know her well enough, 
For she's called the Bowery Belle! 
And I 
am known by all the folks 
As the handsome Broadway Swell! 
Oh, I 
am a 
Swell, Ize, 
I 
must be off, it's getting late, 
For this young Belle to see ; 
She said she'd meet me at half-past eight, 
Walking in the Bowery. 
Good-bye, my friends, we'll meet again 
Some other night, and I'll tell 
Of this here dashing, nice young Belle, 
And also of this Broadway Swell ! 
Oh, I 
am a 
Swell, &c.

NIGHT OFF."

Cornelius Duffy, the people's choice, 
A

Will represent our government. 
And surely lead the van;

His constituents all agree, 
He'll hold the chair and rule it there. 
Far up in Albany. 
CHORUS. 
Then rise your voices every one, 
The enemy we will hunt, 
We'll rule New York, ah that's the talk,

You can drink your lager on Sunday then, 
And speak your mind at will, 
You can fight all night, till broad day-light, 
The police can't keep you still; 
Your influence will be powerful, 
Led by a

So rise your voices every one, 
The enemy we must hunt, 
Let's draw our swords, and carry the ward,

And live upon red herrings, bones, 
And maccaroni tea;

WHERE CAN MY LITTLE BROTHER BE? 
25 
Sung by HAERV OSBORNE. 
Where can my little 'mother be. 
Why ever did he stray ? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away; 
To bring him back, my love is such, 
I 
must some plan devise, 
My grief is when I 
think how much 
'Twill cost to advertise. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Can he have gone away, 
To study hard at Botany, 
Afar in Botany Bay ? 
He's six feet high and very lean, 
His length's his chiefest charm, 
His boots are twelves, his gloves sixteens, 
lie's tatoo'd on his arm; 
His face a 
noble cast was deem' d, 
A 
cast his optics bore, 
His Roman nose turn'd up, and seem'd 
To say Excelsior. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be ? 
Why ever did lie stray ? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
Fll h-pe, he'll stay away. 
'Twas doubtful when I 
saw him, for 
His form was faint and dim ; 
You could not quite be sure which was 
His shadow, which was him : 
His legs were like the pelican's, 
So tall he seemed indeed, 
With graceful neck, long as the swan's, 
A 
hop pole run to seed. 
*Where can, etc. 
His voice it is a 
baritone. 
And if you heard him try 
To sing, I 
feel assured it would bring 
A 
tear into your eye ; 
His upper notes are like the lark's. 
His lower notes are groans; 
Perhaps the Negro Minstrels have 
Bought him up for bones.

AT HOME IN ALABAM. 
Original Song and Dance, by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
Oh! white folks all good evening, 
We've come to sing to you 
About our home in Alabam, 
Our Massa and Missus too. 
We use to work down in de field, 
Dey call us Pete and Sam; 
At evenings how we'd sing and dance 
At home in Alabam. 
CHORUS. 
The good old times have passed, but still 
We're happy as two clams; 
We'll sing and do a 
step we done, 
At home in Alabam. 
Old massa he was kind to us, 
But soon he passed away ; 
And silence reigns around the place, 
Where things were once so gay. 
The aarkies they have all gone North, 
And scarcely left a 
man 
To play upon the old banjo, 
At home in Alabam. 
The good old times, &c. 
Oh !_ white folks all, we'll say good-bye, 
We're much obliged to you 
For listening to our little song, 
We tried to please you too. 
We're free and honest niggers now, 
We love old Uncle Sam, 
And the Lord up high will give us all 
A 
home in Alabam. 
The good old times, &c.

As sung by JOHNSON AND BRUNO. 
Oh my soul, my soul, I'm a 
going for to rest, 
In the arms of the angel Gabriel; 
And I 
climb on de hill, and I 
looked to de West, 
And I 
cross over Jordan to de Lamb; 
And I 
sit me down in de old arm chair, 
Oh brethren, I'll never tire ; 
Oh Satan may sneeze, but I'll take my ease, 
And I'll warm myself at the holy fire. 
CHORUS. 
For we'll dance, (
Break) 
And we'll shout, (
Break) 
And we'll rise up so early in de morn; 
Den we will rise, and rub our sleepy eyes, 
When a 
Gabriel am blowing his horn. 
Oh we shan't weep long, when were going to leave 
So we'll pack up our band box, and we'll go; 
Oh me brudder I'm a 
thinking, and coat you ever grieve 
For we's gwine up to glory very slow; 
And we'll eat our meals three times a 
day, 
And you'll bet your life we won't be late; 
Oh we'll have lots a 
fun, when you and my brudder come, 
For we's gwine to take de tickets at de gate. 
For we'll dance, & c.

SO 
THE OUT AT THE HILL, 
AIR: Remember you love in my prayers. 
Composed by HARRY OSBORNE and sung with great success by 
FANNY W ENTWORTH. 
Oh, how often my mind retraces joy past, 
When childhood and youth knew no care, 
How I 
rambled with Kate, the pride of Newlas, 
Plucking wild flowers to wreath in her hair. 
How oft did our playmates stare at u5 and prate, 
In that ancient old town near the mill, 
When returning from rambles with beautiful Kate. 
Seeing her home to that c )t 
at the hill, 
I 
remember how often her eyes they would beam, 
When I'd tell her a 
sweet tale of love, 
How my mind was enraptured with youth's happy dream, 
Oh how blest by our ruler above, 
Then oh shall we part from each other at last. 
Leave that love we bear fade with will; 
Oh no I 
would seek for to moulder and pass 
In a 
grave at the foot of yon hill 
I 
MET HER IN THE DELL, 
As sung by HARRY W ESTERN, at Tony Pastors. 
Air— The Briar. 
WHILE strolling by a 
cottage door, 
To watch the girls so fair, 
I 
fell in love with a 
black-eyed girl, 
Her name was Kitty Claire. 
I've just received a 
letter, 
From the maid I 
love so well, 
She set my heart a 
twitching, 
When I 
met her in the dell— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, don't I 
love this black-eyed girl 
Of her I 
love to tell, 
I 
loved her first then kissed her, 
When I 
met her in the dell. 
I'm going to see that girl to-night. 
And tell her of my love. 
I 
know she's waiting for me now, 
She is my turtle dove. 
When I 
am married to her, 
I'll come again and tell 
You more about this black-eyed girl. 
That I 
met in the dell.

NOT BEFORE PA, DEAR, 
As sung by Com, BURGESS. 
Some lovers are so bashful, 
They will never say a 
word, 
But only blush and tremble, 
Which looks, I'm sure, absurd. 
While others they will kiss their love, 
Or know the reason why; 
But when my charmer's pa is near— 
These words are her reply— 
CHORUS. • 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
Say that you love me, but not before pa; 
Not before pa, dear, not before pa, 
I 
don't mind a 
kiss, dear, but not before pa. 
I'm very fond of flirting, 
But there's one I 
love best; 
I'm sure I'm rot too bashful 
In seeking love's request. 
Last night I 
went to see her pa, 
To squeeze her hand I 
tried; 
When I 
called her my little queen, 
These words she then replied— 
Not before pa, &c. 
We strolled into the garden, 
And underneath the trees, 
We sat upon the lovers' seat, 
To inhale the summer breeze; 
I 
told her how I 
loved her, 
Which caused a 
dreadful sigh; 
And when I 
said, " Oh, name the day," 
These words were her reply— 
Not before pa, &a

And my eyes at once be rayed affection,

SUNNY LAND,

By 
COTTON & BIRDITE. 
When we were together, in that sunny land, 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd wander through the cotton fields, 
And hear the Jay-bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At evening, when the boys were on the green, 
We'd join them in the festive (1,

We wish those happy, happy days

LOVE'S SERENADE. 
Words and Music by CLAUDE DEHAVEN. 
(Copyright secured.) 
WHEN in my dreams I 
fondly think of brother, 
When in visions fondly dream of mother, 
When the night long watch is ended, 
And the busy day suspended, 
All my fancies, all my visions may come true, 
Still in fancy dreaming I 
only love but you. 
Whed the midnight stars are peeping, 
And the silvery dew secreting 
Fragrance for the coming day; 
When auroras charms are blended 
To the Southern skies extended, 
Memory paints the picture—no matter what you say. 
Deftly clings the moonlight 
On the curtained starlight, 
Chequered clouds of fancies floating all around; 
Glinted zephyrs playing—stately actions swaying 
In this pure Elysian—this holy fancy ground. 
Fire-flies dancing in the humming. 
Angels on their lutes are strumming. 
Love's cohorts in armor coming, 
O'er the mountains dipped in dew. 
Victory on their banner ensigned, 
Glory on their armor entwined, 
still in fancy dreaming, I 
only love but you.

Words by JOECN T. 
R-crTLEDGE. 
They say I'm the leader of fashion, 
That no one with me can compare; 
You can tell by the style that I 
dress in, 
If you meet me, wherever you are; 
The ladies all smile on me sweetly, 
A 
thing that I 
most dearly love; 
You can hear them remark as they meet me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
CHORUS. 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, he's handsome and winning, 
The dear little fellow I 
love; 
The ladies all ,say as they meet me, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove I 
I 
am counted sweetest of waltzers, 
At boating they say I'm immense; 
I 
bet on the favorite horses, 
I 
am gifted with lots of good sense; 
I 
move in the bon-ton society, 
I'm counted a 
lucky young cove; 
Its a 
saying wherever I 
wander, 
He's a 
nobby young fellow, by Jove! 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, &e. 
I 
go to the watering places, 
To live through the hot weather spell; 
Make love to the sweetest of faces, 
A 
pastime I 
like mighty well ; 
My lot in this life is a 
nice one, 
In fact it has long been the case; 
I 
have really more fun than the next one. 
Don't you wish you could step in my place ? 
Yes, he's a 
nobby, &c.

FAR away down South in Alabama, 
Where the darkies plant the cotton and the corn,— 
In the land where blooms the sweet magnolias, 
In that paradise us darkies we were born;— 
Old Massa he was kind, and little Missus too, 
They'd be amus'd to see us jump and dance,— 
Oh! they call us Alabama Blossoms, 
And we're going back when e'er we get a 
chance.

the sweet girls down in Alabama, 
We are longing ev'ry day more to see,— 
And there's one that says I 
am her darling, 
And I 
know that she is all the world to me;— 
Oh ! when she said good-bye, it made thig dirkey ety, 
My heart was full of ev'ry kind of pain,— 
But I'm going back to Jane Matildt, 
For I 
want to see her lovely face again. 
Old Massa he was, etc. 
We have been far from old Alabama, 
But there is no place that we love half so well,— 
And our secret now at last we've told you, 
But our love affairs we didn't mean to tell;— 
We know that far away, they're waiting ev'ry day, 
To see us corning smiling up the lane,— 
And we'll go back to the land of Cotton, 
And we'll never leave the dear old place again.

HAPPY AS A 
OLAM. 
As sung by the " King Bees" DELEHANTY & CUMMINGS. 
On a 
little old plantation, 
Where de light I 
first did see, 
Down on de Swanee River, 
In de State of Florida; 
Old Massa he was fat and good, 
And alwas used me right, 
And when I'd sing or dance for him, 
He'd scream out with delight. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my! I'm as Happy as a 
Clam, (Symph.) 
I'm India Rubber Gutta Percha Gum Elastic Sam. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
When I 
left de old plantation 
This advice he gave to me: 
Don't never mix in politics, 
Or play in Policy. 
So off I 
went just like a 
gun, 
And now I 
take my chance, 
In going around de town, 
And for de white folks sing and dance. 
Oh, my! &c. 
I've danced for every nation, 
From de Dutch to de Chinese; 
I've danced up hill and down again, 
And I 
danced upon the Seas; 
But I 
know a 
little Yallow Gal, 
And her l'm going to try; 
And I'll dance for her affections, 
Or I'll dance until I 
die.

CITMMINGS. 
Yes, they ask me why I 
always seem so happy, 
And they criticize my gay and airy style, 
nut they know not how I 
love a 
little beauty; 
I'm swimming in the sweetness of her smile, 
Little angels seem to hover all around me, 
While the birds direct to me their joyous lay, 
And the fish within the streamlet play to please me, 
Since I 
met this little flower, Lilly May.

More lovely than the blooming rose, 
The dew drop pearl within; 
And constant as the stream that flows, 
A 
precious pr:ze to win. 
There's a 
band of angels singing in her laughter, 
And a 
cupid merry making in her eye; 
With a 
shyness like the pearl I 
named her after, 
Recollection of her beauty brings a 
sigh ; 
But she said she always wished to see me happy, 
Would help to ease my days of care and strife, 
And a 
sweeter, dearer vow she lately made me, 
'Twas her willingness to share my future life. 
More lovely, &e.

Written and composed by BEN COTTON, JR. 
You see in us two nimble Mokes, 
We're called the magnet twins! 
They cannot put the brakes on us 
As soon as day begins! 
We are like two balls of quicksilver, 
You never And us slow; 
We are never happy, day or night, 
Unless we're on the go! 
CHORUS. 
High-Low-Jack, in the game! 
We are really not to blame; 
You'll have to watch us very close— 
Now what we say is true— 
Or else your eyes will be deceived, 
And you won't see what we do. 
Our style is quite original, 
With us none can compare. 
We bounce like India Rubber balls, 
And cut while in the air. 
At Gymnastics we take the lead, 
At dancing we're not slow! 
And grace is here personified, 
So watch us as we go.

TWO HAPPY BOYS. 
Sung by THOMAS & HEENEY ut Hooky's Opera House,

I 
WISH we were two blys again, 
As we were years ago, 
To slide down on some cellar door, 
And wear out all our clothes. 
We stand around the corner 
Then, and have such jolly fun, 
Until some " cop.per" he would 
Come and give us all a 
run. 
CHORUS. 
I 
wish we were two boys alain, 
So happy gay and light, 
We hang out on the come, s, 
And dance the whole long night. 
I 
wish we were two boys again, 
And would not have the mumps, 
We go down to railroad-cars, 
And pick up lots of stumps. 
We walk around the city then, 
Smoking our favorite weed, 
While other boys would holler, 
Look out, there goes Bill Tweed.

it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
'where to do it." and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting.'•

It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol.

amusement. Read what a 
leading Journal Says of it: 
"&n ingenious 
ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order, has been sent us, 
called 'HOMPTY HIIMPTY,' and bound in such a 
way as to give opportus 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is los 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting the' leave 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrail 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit; the next only Columbine, thin 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A 
littIC 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."—Phil. Eve. Bull

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is the old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We hirve 
published it for years. and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are err Inged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Enclosed in handsome case

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diftl. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, manylives are spent as an unloved 
tedious eiisteuee, which might have been proonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own. unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
