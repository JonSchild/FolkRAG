I've written so many letters to you in my mind,  this
 
posted one is mere footnote.
 Not easy to adequately
 
tell you how much it's meant to me to know you.
 Your
 
calm optimism,  your wonderful laugh and,  yes,  your
 
commitment to the good,  have been high points in my
 
life.
 And your're always,  always,  fun to be with.
 
I've been of no help to Alan.
 When the Schuster work
 
met only with silence or ridicule,  I withdrew from
 
academia and devoted myself to trees.
 The few times
 
I stepped back into that world,  I met only strangers
 
who proved less than welcoming.
 
I sense a great sea change in which electricity
 
reinstates mysticism,  while bushing aside
 
rationalism.
 This leads to attacks on,  or put-downs
 
of,  anyone seeking rational answers.
 I enclose a
 
recent clipping from The New York Observer which you
 
may not have seen.
 Harry Smith?
 Library of Congress
 
two-volume Antholoqy? 
Hey!
 
A close friend of mine looked after Smith at the
 
Chelsea,  took him to the hospital,  boxed the chaos he
 
left behind & shipped it to the Library of Congress.
 
At the hospital,  a nurse asked him how old Harry was:
 
'He says,  "68",  but the doctors say he must be in his
 
90s'.
 
As I see it,  there's the immediate problem of
 
financial support to preserve & advance Alan's work.
 
The larger problem is to encourage an environment
 
advancing that work.
 I'd like to be able to tell you
 
the Rock Foundation could contribute to the first,
 
but at the moment,  it's fundless.
 There is property,
 
intended for a park,  that may be sold,  but that won't
 
occur for at least several years,  if at all.
 
In the meantime,  let me shake off depression and try
 
to help.

Drawing Shadows to Stone illustrates and
 
documents ninety-seven photographs from the Jesup
 
Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History
 
(ANNH).
 Actually,  it's far more than that.
 
Its design alone merits high praise.
 I don't
 
mean paper,  printing or reproduction,  all elegant,
 
but something more basic:  design compliments content.
 
Contact prints,  made from glass negatives,  were left
 
uncropped,  with ragged borders,  inspiring confidence
 
in accuracy.
 The format conveys a sense of history,
 
even an aura of mystery.
 Text and photographs blend
 
like metals in an alloy.
 The whole is immensely
 
satisfying.
 
Six authors recount  (in plain English)  a drama
 
played out against exotic backgrounds by a cast of
 
extraordinary characters.
 Franz Boas'  Jesup
 
Expedition,  begun with great expectations and pursued
 
with dedication,  briefly became the major event in
 
American anthropology.
 
Betweeen 1897-1902,  two teams of anthropologists,
 
American and Russian,  studied native tribes on both
 
sides of Bering Strait.
 In that short period,  they
 
documented the customs of a dozen societies,  recorded
 
languages,  transcribed beliefs,  and shipped thousands
 
of artifacts to the ANNH.
 
Over the next thirty-two years,  most of their
 
reports appeared.
 But essentially the enterprise was
 
quickly over.
 Boas reversed course.
 His original
 
commitment had been to unravel the past;  now he
 
favored influencing the present.
 For nearly a
 
century,  the Jesup collections attracted little
 
attention.
 
Those who rediscovered them were drawn to them
 
visually,  to their art or photographs.
 Most came
 
from outside anthropology.
 Thomas Ross Miller and
 
Barabara Mathe are photography scholars.
 Here they
 
selected photographs to illustrate specific points
 
about "photographic reality."
 Their insights enrich
 
anthropology as a whole.
 Their comments on early
 
anthropology are less successful:
 
"Ironically,  in 'salvaging'  items for museums,
 
anthropologists also hastened the demise of the very
 
things they sought to preserve"  (p.  24).
 In fact,
 
some of those same anthropologists commissioned
 
multiple copies both for museums  (the AMNH has many)
 
and for local use,  furthering continuity.
 
"The origins of natural history museums can be
 
traced to European 'cabinets of curiosities "'  (p.
 
25).
 Not so.
 Natural history museums came into
 
being in direct response to Darwin's observation that
 
all life could be placed on a common basis,  governed
 
by a common principle.
 They challenged freak
 
cabinets  (unnatural history)  and relic shrines
 
(supernatural history).
 The first Gilbralter skull,
 
1848,  remained a curio until The Origin of Species,
 
1859,  allowed us to see it as a natural object.
 
Today we're urged to abandoned natural history
 
museums in favor of American Indian shrines.
 How
 
quickly we forget.
 
Four anthropologists  (Laura Kendall,  Stanley A.
 
Freed,  Ruth S.  Freed and Laila Williamson)  capture
 
both the spirit and the dilemma of the Jesup
 
Expedition.
 Boas believed Science began with the
 
assembly of evidence.
 Just where it went from there
 
was less clear to him.
 
In the end,  not far.
 The collections gathered
 
dust.
 But at least they weren't dispersed.
 Field
 
collectors had distributed photographs of the ANNH,
 
promising images and artifacts "would reside in a
 
regal building in a great city"  (p.  38).
 Unlike the
 
nearby Heye Foundation, which deaccessioned 91,000
 
specimens,  the ANNH honored its trust.
 
Morris Jesup,  the sponsor after whom the
 
expedition took its name,  "liked big projects and
 
major scientific problems"  (p.  10).
 Boas sold him on
 
the idea of discovering the origin of American
 
Indians.
 Since Boas already knew the answer to that
 
question,  I assume he had other questions in mind,
 
perhaps of Darwinian dimensions.
 
Whatever they were,  they went unasked.
 Perhaps
 
they seemed inconsequential in comparison to peoples'
 
lives.
 No grand comparative study followed.
 
Instead,  Boas re-defined Culture as cultures,
 
promoted ethnic dignity and opposed racism.
 American
 
anthropology became political.
 
Not that ideas were then lacking.
 In 1909,
 
Robert Hertz published The Pre-eminence of the Right
  
Hand. 
That essay,  in America,  had the impact of a
 
wet sponge hitting Mont Blanc.
 Boas'  early students
 
(Kroeber,  Lowie,  Speck,  Radin)  continued to study
 
traditional cultures,  but the father of it all looked
 
elsewhere.
 The comparative method faded.
 Dorothy
 
Lee's brilliant linguistic comparisons virtually
 
never happened.
 Carl Schuster,  who took
 
Structuralism deep into prehistory,  found his work
 
ignored.
 Ironically,  much of that work was
 
undertaken at the ANNH with Jesup data.
 
Drawing Shadows to Stone was part of the Jesup II
 
Symposium,  held at the ANNH,  1997.
 The plan was to
 
put the Expedition back on track.
 For a week,
 
scholars read papers.
 Many were excellent.
 The
 
overall tone of the symposium,  however,  concerned
 
ethnic identity,  gender studies,  shamanitis, even a
 
whiff of Jung.
 
Considering the state of race relations in
 
America a hundred years ago,  Boas probably made the
 
right choice.
 But not now.
 Today Darwinian
 
psychologists borrow from software.
 Linguists talk
 
of universal wiring.
 These and other New Age claims
 
enjoy wide acceptance,  unencumbered by evidence.
 
They should be tested.
 
Our museums bulge with relevant data.
 
Anthropologists still have the comparative method,
 
however rusty.
 Are any willing to put their precious
 
learning in jeopardy,  ignore political pressures,
 
by-pass funding,  and venture into the unknown?
 I
 
hope my life expectancy extends that far.
