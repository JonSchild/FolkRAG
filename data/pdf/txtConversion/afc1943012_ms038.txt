Dear Dr. Botkin:
Thank you for your recent letter. Yes, I received the needles, and I apologize for not
having mentioned that fact in my letter. I am glad you realized that I had the needles. At
the time I wrote you my mind was running along different channels.
Up to date I have done fairly well in the acquisition of new war songs. I think you will
be pleased with my findings. With great effort and patience I have been able to make
some rather smooth recordings but the machine which I am using is faulty and of a very
elementary design. At present the turntable is giving trouble because of its tendency to
rock from side to side, causing a very ludicrous whine along the outer two inches of the
record. At first I modified this tendency by moving the needle inward from two to three
inches at the outset but the condition lately has increased. I am seeking at the present
time to have this fault corrected if I can in this area. Perhaps I might be able to borrow a
turntable out of Atlanta or Macon. Anyway, I shall make an effort to do so and continue in
the meantime to do what I can. Do not be too alarmed about this because the recordings I
have made to date are good, clean and distinct. Fortunately the machine seemed to have
gone haywire all at once rather than gradually.

I am sending you one of the letters announcing our Annual Summer Folk Festival and you
will note that I am giving special consideration to your needs.
If you could make arrangements for me to have a Presto machine for this occasion I can
get some good things for you. I would like for you to react to this at once so that I may
be able to make my plans, in accordance, right away. The matter of getting words to
the songs on separate paper is giving some trouble because the people can not always
repeat the words without singing them, and frequently when they sing them I am so busy
recording that I do not have opportunity to write them down but I think this can be worked
out through an assistant.
I have spoken to Dr.Bond in regard to the records that you mentioned. I have not been
able to acquire them yet but I have the promise that I may have them. I will be needing
some new discs for this and they have been ordered but I will not be able to proceed until
they arrive. All of our supplies must be ordered from elsewhere. I cannot acquire anything
of this sort in this small town.
With best wishes, I am
Sincerely yours, Willis Laurence James Willis Laurence James Visiting Professor of Music

In years past we have had great times here, singing together, meeting old friends and
winning prizes. This year we are not only giving prizes but we are also giving to every
single person who takes a part in the festival a very beautiful certificate. These certificates
are suitable for framing and will be signed with the State seal and by the president of the
college, as well as by the festival director, who happens to be me.
We are also giving prizes of $20.00, $15.00 and $10.00 for the best choirs, and $20.00,
$15.00 and $10.00 for the best quartets. This is more than we have ever given before and
we are looking to have a great time together. Come and meet your friends and hear some
fine singing.
Be sure to have spirituals ready to sing. We do not want you to sing hymns. If you can
make up some songs about the War we will give special consideration to them and if they
are good we will make records of them and send them to Washington, D.C. Here is your
chance to get in the war effort and do something for yourself and at the same time become
known in a very lasting way. You may make up a war song about the Negro's part in it, or
any way you wish to make it. Remember, you do not have to make up a war song to be in
the festival but it will be nice if you can, and we will see that your song is recorded if it is
good and send it to Washington.
The festival begins 4:30 P.M. Sunday, August 1, 1943. Be sure to get here by 2:00 P.M. to
register.
Inclosed is a card addressed to me. Kindly write on this card if you are coming and mail it
back to me at once.
Hoping to see you here soon, I am
Your same good friend, Willis Laurence James Director of the Festival
