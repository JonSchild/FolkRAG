Baldy Green I'll tall you all a story and I'll tell it in a song,And I hope that it will please you, for it won't
detain you long;'Tis about one of the old boys, so gallus and so fine,Who used to carry mails on the
Pioneer Line.He was the greatest favor-ite that ever yet was seen,He was known about Virginny by
the name of "Baldy" Green;Oh, he swung a whip so gracefully, and he vas bound to shine [md] For
he was the high-toned driver on the Pioneer Line.Now, as he was driving out one night, as lively
as a coon,He saw three men jump in the road, by the pale light of the moon.Two spring for the
leaders, while one his shot-gun cocks,Sayings "Baldy, we hate to trouble you, but just pass us out
the box."When Baldy heard them say these words, he opened wide his eyes.He didn't know what in
the world to do, for it took him by surpriseThen he reached into the boot, sayings "Take it Sirs, with
pleasure" [md] And so out into the middle of the road went Wells & Fargo's treasure.Now when they
got the treasure box, they seemed quite satisfied[,?]For the men who held the leaders then politely
stepped aside[,?]Saying, "Baldy, we've got what we want, so drive along your team[,?]"And he made
the quickest time to Silver City ever seen.Don't say "Greenbacks" to Baldy, now, for it makes him feel
so sore,He'd travelled the road a-many a time, but was never stopped before.Oh[!?] The chances they
were three to one, and shot-guns were the game.And if you'd a-been in Baldy's place, you'd a-shelled
'er out the same.
