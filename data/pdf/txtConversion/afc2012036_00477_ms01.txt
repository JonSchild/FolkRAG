Fletcher Powell interviewing Barry Ellis on June 6, 2013 at Money Town Pawn 
Shop on south Oliver in Wichita. 
 
Tell us who you are and what you do. 
 
Ok, uh, my name is Barry Ellis, I own Money Town, Incorporated. Um, we’re a pawn 
shop, uh, we loan money on merchandise and we sell merchandise, and we buy, sell, 
and trade. 
 
Are you from Wichita? 
 
I was born in Wichita. 
 
Ok, and you’ve lived here most of your life? 
 
All my life. 
 
Growing up, or even back in your family’s history, have you had anybody involved in 
the aviation industry? 
 
Uh, yes. Actually, just about all my relatives were in the Air Force, um, I have a 
famous uncle who is James Jabara, Colonel James Jabara, which the airport is named 
after, and, uh, he was killed in a car accident after serving so many missions, um, 
when I was in the eighth grade. Um, he was the first jet ace in history, in Korea, and a 
triple jet ace. 
 
Tell me a little bit about the history of Money Town, when it started and so on. 
 
My dad opened a small pawn shop in, like, the early ‘60s, uh, at Mt. Vernon and 
Oliver, and it grew quickly and, uh, so he built a building at 31st and Oliver, and 
that’s when it became Money Town Pawn Shop. My dad had some spinal issues and 
couldn’t do the lifting, and he decided to go into the jewelry business, so he opened 
up Jewelry Savers, uh, in ’74, and I bought Money Town from him in ’74. 
 
And it’s been yours ever since then. 
 
Yes. 
 
So, talking to, uh, various Boeing employees throughout this project, um, the name of 
Money Town has come up probably more than a couple of times. And not just pawn 
shops, generally, but Money Town, in particular. How do you feel like that relationship 
between your business and Boeing employees came about? How did that develop? 
 
Well, first of all, we were right beside Boeing, um, from 1966 until 17 years ago, and, 
uh, Boeing employees after work or on their lunch break would come and visit our 
store, shop, and we got real close relationships with a lot of Boeing employees 
through that time period, and some of those people I still—a lot of them I still have 
relationships with. We’ve know, we’ve had customers from Boeing for, you know, 47 
years. 
 
So you’ve got a close enough relationship that you know a lot of them by face and 
name. 
 
Oh yes. Yes. A lot of them. 
 
Boeing… the employees certainly have told us, and a number of other business owners 
have told us that Boeing is pretty famous for going through sort of feast or famine 
years. Um, sometimes doing quite well and other times not doing quite so well. Could 
you see that, as the owner of Money Town? Could you see those ups and downs through 
your business? 
 
Definitely, yes. We would hear stories, of course, friends and customers would come 
in and, you know, there’s been layoffs, several layoffs through the years. Um, and 
then there’s been times when they’ve done well and the—Boeing has done well, and 
they, uh, you know, give Christmas bonuses and—they used to, years ago. And um, 
so we would hear stories, and of course it affected our business in different ways, 
whether people were needing money or they were buying merchandise. 
 
So talk about what it might have looked like for you guys during some of the more 
down periods for Boeing. 
 
4:52 
 
Well, of course, we had relationships with a lot of these people, so of course it’s sad 
to see people get laid off. And, actually, you know, people have a, um—they think the 
down times pawn shops thrive, that’s not necessarily true, um, we would rather the 
economy be good because we’ve got to sell what we bring in the store. But you could 
tell, people would come in and talk about it, and depending on how long they were 
laid off, some of them would get pretty bad off when they started losing their 
unemployment and, um, a lot of them were suffering. 
 
I think that’s pretty interesting that you did have a personal enough relationship that 
what I hear you saying is that people would come in and be talking to you about it, not 
just that you would see a pick up in people needing loans or whatnot, but people would 
actually be having those conversations with you about it as well. 
 
Sure. They would always, um, we would hear stories, both good and bad. Um, you 
know, Boeing’s had several layoffs in the 47 years we’ve been in business, um, and 
so we’ve gone through ups and downs with them and it affects our business, um, 
both ways. 
 
And so, during the good times, I guess—and I, personally am not, um, I’m a little bit 
ignorant of the way the pawn shop business works, but, so in the good times for 
Boeing, you would have more people coming in to buy your merchandise, which is, 
which ends up being better for you guys. 
 
Well, they—yes, we would sell more merchandise in a good economy, also people 
would pick up their pawns, redeem what they had in the pawn shop. Especially at 
Christmas-time. We would have a lot of, um, people picking up their pawns and 
buying Christmas presents and that sort of thing. 
 
Was there anything that you might typically see, um, as, sort of, very regular things 
people would bring in to pawn? 
 
The type of merchandise? 
 
The type of merchandise. 
 
Well, we handle a lot of jewelry and we handle a lot of firearms, um, electronics of all 
kinds, TVs, stereos, cameras, everything, um, tools. You know, just everything that—
anything that’s worth, that has value we pretty much take and, um, so—and there 
would be people who would come in maybe one week and pawn their shotgun and 
pick it up the next week, next two weeks, and then bring it back in a couple more 
weeks, you know, they have an unexpected car repair or whatever, you know, it’s 
just, there’s lots of reasons why people need money. 
 
Yeah, and you could generally, maybe, see those cycles happening as Boeing’s 
employment cycles happened as well. 
 
Definitely. Definitely. Yeah, when people were laid off, you know, of course they’d 
pawn merchandise, and, uh, and there would be less redeeming and less, uh, selling. 
And then when Boeing was hiring and when they were peaking in their business, of 
course we would see more redeeming and selling. 
 
Was there ever anything that maybe somebody brought in during some of those lower 
periods that really surprised you? 
 
Um… 
 
This might be the kind of business where you don’t get surprised. 
 
Yeah, I mean, I’ve seen just about everything there is to see, so, no, I don’t, uh—I 
guess the thing that probably made me the saddest is we had a good customer that 
was in dire straits and wanted to pawn his mobile home. And of course we can’t do 
that, it’s against the law. But um… yeah. 
 
As someone who’s had these personal relationships with Boeing for so long, and as 
someone who’s had so much aviation history in your family, did you have any personal 
reaction at all to the news that Boeing was going to leave town completely? 
 
10:04 
 
Oh, it’s very sad to me that Boeing is leaving town because we have such a good—
they have a good facility here and a facility that meets all their needs. And, of course, 
Boeing’s been a, you know, a household name in Wichita for as long as I can 
remember. Actually, my dad worked for Boeing for one day in the, oh, it was 
probably in the early ‘50s. He lasted about one day and said, ‘this isn’t for me.’ But, 
um, anyway, yeah, it’s sad that they’re leaving, um, I think, um… I think it’s just the 
times that we live in today, it’s just a… I don’t know. It’s just sad. 
 
Do you feel like it’s going to have any impact on your business? 
 
No. Um, everything’s gone to Spirit, so we have people from Spirit, uh, Cessna’s right 
down the street, um, of course McConnell, and, uh—so, no. I don’t. 
 
Sort of looking back on Boeing’s time here, do you have any feeling for what you might 
say their impact on the community has been through the years? 
 
Well, it’s been a huge impact. For all of Wichita. Whenever Boeing had layoffs it 
would affect all of Wichita, all businesses, all of everything, really. And lots of 
families. And of course, like I said, when there were good times, that would affect 
businesses also, in a positive way. With me, personally, I had such close 
relationships with—and I still do, because most of those Boeing employees are now 
at Spirit, so, you know, they’re still in the same business, still doing the same thing, 
it’s just a different name now. But I had such a close relationship with these people 
that it was, uh, it was always sad for me to see people get laid off and… they were 
usually friends. 
 
Well, I was actually going to ask that, have you developed friendships outside of even 
your business? 
 
Sure. Of course. Yeah, I’ve got very close friends that work out in Boeing—or Spirit, 
now, yeah. 
 
So I guess that was sort of looking back. Looking forward, let’s say 10, 20, 30 years 
down the line, what do you think people might consider Boeing’s legacy in the town to 
have been? 
 
Hmm, well… Of course, they were the huge, um, aircraft company, you know, in the 
United States. And it started—well, it started in Seattle, but Wichita was a big part of 
it, um… I think Boeing probably brought the, um, the name, the Air Capital, you 
know, um, they kinda started that because I don’t think—I think if it weren’t for 
Boeing we wouldn’t have Cessna, Learjet, and all the others here. Um, but, that 
started the whole trend of aircraft industry in Wichita, I think. 
 
 Do you figure we’ll, um, as a city, ultimately just be fine with them leaving or do you 
think it’s gonna hurt us for a while? In the larger community, not just with your 
business, specifically. 
 
Um, no, I don’t think it’s, I don’t think it’s gonna hurt Wichita’s economy, because, 
like I said, everybody’s pretty much gone to Spirit or one of the other aircraft 
companies, or Koch.
