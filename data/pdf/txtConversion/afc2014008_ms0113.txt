Dear Bess:
 
It seems that my dreams about sunbathing on the
 
beaches of Puerto Rico were shattered by
 
democracy and the next meeting is going to be
 
in Atlanta after all.
 I think that the folk
 
morality play,  the program of which you enclosed,
 
could be an excellent event which all the members
 
of the Society would be excited about.
 I am
 
writing to Dr. Councill Taylor in this regard.
 
If this program materializes, I am sure all the
 
members of the Society will be grateful to you.
 
best wishes,
 
Dan Ben-Amos

I
t was nice to see you in Indiana.  I am enclosing the program of the folk
 
morality play which I mentioned to you as a possible part of next year's
 
meeting, assuming we do agree to go to Atlanta.  The friend who sent me the
 
program -- Dr. Councill Taylor -- writes as follows:
 
The enclosed shows how I spent l
ast night:
 
a s
tunning evening -- also a nostalgic *vent.  Do
 
you have any knowledge of other protostant churches

I am sure Dr. Taylor would be glad to give you more information about the
 
play and the players; you can write him (
through the remainder of the
 
academic year) at the Department of Anthropolo-
 Morehouse College- Box 64
 
Atlanta, Georgia, 30314; from June, 1969 on, it would be safer to -ad-dress him here.
 
Personally, 10d make the trip to Atlanta just to catch this program before
 
the television drowns i

Dear Wayland:
 
I guess I will hand-deliver this at the CFS meeting -
-
 faster than the
 
mails anyway
 I
 
I expect I should have declined when I was appointed to this committee
 
as I was the non-unanimous factor before and will probably have to play
 
that role again.
 
On point one, I do not think that the Fellows should be e
lected by the
 
entire membership.  Cooptation does not seem to me an undemocratic
 
process within a l
earned society; frankly, the point seems to me to be
 
recognized by your s
cholarly peers, not to win a contest.  Perhaps the
 
overall a
im of reaching c
loser contact between the Fellows and the
 
Society could be fostered by recommending that nominations be forwarded
 
to the Fellows for consideration from any member or group of members
 
in good s
tanding.  However, there may be pitfalls in this suggestion
 
that I don't see.
 
As for point #2, I have no particular objection to the notion that the
 
past president should be made a Fellow, though it seems to me shrill
 
and tendentious (
to quote Katherine Briggs) to require it.  I should
 
imagine that past presidents have generally received this honor in the
 
normal course of events, but perhaps I on mistaken and this is a point
 
of past difficulty.
 
On point #3, an Annual Report would seem not too onerous a burden to
 
l
ay upon the Fellows, and it might alleviate some of the concerns ex-
pressed at the board meeting, all of which seemed to center around the
 
problem of our dwindling exchequer.
 
Finally, I do not feel that the number of Fellows should be f
ixed.  My
 
understanding of the Fellows is that it is an honorary organization,
 
and the whole point of an honor i
s that it should be given when i
t i
s
 
deserved and not according to some calendrical consideration.  The
 
Fellows have shown no s
igns as far as I know of self-aggrandizement,
 
and I don't really see why this particu $r stipulation received committee
 
support.
 
Just between the two of us, I f
ind this whole issue extremely distasteful
 
and I would think that this committee could be put to better uses.  However,
 
the problem i
s upon us and I suppose someone has to settle it.  I am sorry
 
not to have arranged my arguments in the pro and con fashion you suggested,
 
but I do feel rather strongly on most of these points and this is the best
 
I could do in a hurry.
 
Yours,
 
Bess

t does not behoove me at this tine,  I think,  to corrisient
 
on the suc
estions made by the Executive Committee.
 A better
 
way,  it seems to me,  is to solicit from you brief statements
 
on each of the four points raised at the meetin7 of Executive
 
Committee in March.
 I meanwhile will set down my ideas on the
 
matter;  so that when I have heard from you I can summarize all
 
of the points of view that developed as reactions to the four
 
oropositions.
 
Where feasible,  I suc est that you mi ht care to address
 
yourselves to the propositions in a oro-an'-con kind of analysis.
 
This wei ,7hin7 of the issues wf
ll provide you with a basis  for
 
a decision as to what action should he taken.
 
I will try then,  in a second letter to the committee,
 
to provide a sort o
f' resume of the issues, with arguments
 
and  "Against"
 as expressed by members of the committee.
 In
 
the same letter I can submit a ballot that will embody the points
 
raised by the Executive Committee,  as well as additional propositions
 
that may have been  proposed by members of our own co m
mittee in
 
their much more throumh-7oin7 study of the whole matter.
 
To aid you in these  i
rnoortont deliberations,  I a m  ser iI n r
r
 
you two documents:
 
The
 
1. Roster of the Fellows of the A me ri c a n  Folklore

2.  Copies of the Constitution and By-Laws of the American
 
Poikiore Society,  as revised an qooroved in 1966.

IV.
 Fellows  
The conclusions regarding the Fellows listed below
 
rest upon a unanimous Committee recognition that
 
there should be a closer relationship between the
 
Fellows and the parent organization than presently
 
exists, but the specific conclusions are supported
 
only by a Committee majority, not unanimity:
 
1
.
 Election to the Fellows should not be by
 
cooptation (which is presently the practice
 
and a common one among learned societies),
 
but by the full membership of the AFS.
 
2
.
 The Past-President should be automatically
 
admitted to the Fellows upon his retirement
 
from the Presidency.
 
3.
 The Fellows should submit an Annual Report
 
to the Executive Board, consisting of (
1)
 
an account of the past year's activities,
 
(
2) a prospectus of the forthcoming year's
 
operation, including any request for neces-
sary funds.
 
4.
 The number of Fellows should be limited to 50.
 
The Committee does not present these conclusions
 
as recommendations at the present time, however,
 
but rather as points for a further discussion in
 
which formal representatives of the Fellows, duly
 
apprised of the relevant issues, should be invited
 
to participate.
 That, in effect, is our recom-
mendation regarding the Fellows.
 
"No action was taken on that section of the
 
draft report dealing with the Fellows.
 An
 
ad hoc Committee,  consisting of Alan Dundes
 
(
chairman), W. Edson Richmond, Wayland Hand,
 
Bess L
. Hawes,  and Susan Kalcik, was subsequently
 
appointed to consider the organization and activities
 
of the Fellows, and make recommendations to the
 
Executive Board concerning such changes as may be
 
deemed necessary.
 The Committee is to submit its
 
report to the Secretary-Treasurer by May 7
,  1975."

 FELLOWS
 
1. The Fellows of the American Folklore Society shall be
 
an honorary, rather than an executive body.
 It is not to
 
include the honorary members of the Society, who are by
 
definition distinguished scholars from outside the United
 
States and Canada.
 It does not carry release from dues,
 
and the Fellows may by unanimous vote raise its dues
 
above the membership norm.
 The Fellows shall constitute
 
an autonomous body within the Society, but its actions
 
shall be subject to review and ratification by the
 
Executive Board of the Society.
 
2. The basic criteria for election of Fellows shall be:
 
(a) Membership in the American Folklore Society.
 
(b) The possession of a professional degree,  the doctor-
ate or its equivalent,  in a field such as literature,
 
anthropology, musicology,  or folklore.
 
(
c) The publication of a significant group of articles
 
or books on folklore, which genuinely contributes to the
 
42
 
discipline, and which conforms to professional standards.
 
(
d) Active work in the advancement of the Society.
 
Of these criteria,  (a) is mandatory.  The satisfaction of
 
any two of the others (
b),  (
c),  (
d) shall be deemed
 
appropriate.
 
3
. The Fellows shall establish its own Executive Committee
 
for the purpose of electing new Fellows, and transacting
 
other pertinent business.
 
(a) The Executive Committee shall be three in number, as
 
follows:  Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Secretary.
 (Follow-
ing the adoption of these By-Laws) the first set of
 
officers shall be named by the Executive Board of the
 
Society.  Thereafter, election to the Executive Com-
mittee of the Fellows shall take place in the manner
 
described below.
 
(
b) The term of office for each of the members of the
 
Executive Committee of the Fellows shall be two calendar
 
years, with no re-election to the same office.  To pro-
vide continuity, however, at the expiration of the term
 
of office of the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman shall auto-
matically become Chairman, and the Secretary shall be-
come Vice-Ohairman.  Before re ti ring  from  office,
 the  
Chairman shall canvass the membership of Fellows looking
 
to the nomination and election of a Secretary.  The
 
Secretary shall be elected from the existing body of
 
Fellows.
 
4
. Election procedure for Fellows shall be:
 
(a) There is no maximum limit to the number of Fellows,
 
but no more than two new Fellows may be elected in any
 
one calendar year.  Contrariwise, although an election
 
of Fellows shall be held annually, it is not mandatory
 
that new Fellows be added each year.
 
(
b) Nominations of prospective new Fellows shall be
 
solicited in writing from all Fellows at least three
 
months before the Society's annual meeting by the
 
Secretary of the Fellows.
 
(
c) Prospective new Fellows shall be nominated by at
 
least five Fellows, either individually or by joint
 
nominating petition.  The nominations shall be supported
 
43
 
by a detailed curriculum vitae and other substantiating
 
data.
 
(
d) Voting on the prospective new Fellows, under the
 
direction of the Executive Committee of the Fellows,
 
shall be completed at least six weeks before the Society's
 
annual meeting.
 A seventy-five percent vote of the full
 
membership of the Fellows is needed for election.
 Cer-
tification of newly elected Fellows shall be made by the
 
Chairman to the President of the Society one month before
 
the annual meeting.
 
(
e) Ratification of the election of Fellows by the
 
Executive Board of the Society shall be secured by the
 
President of the Society in time for formal announcement
 
of the new Fellows at the meeting.

Dear Dr. Collins:

Apparently Dr. Hostettler, whose letter I enclose, assumed from
 
something I said at the AFS meetings in Austin that I intended
 
to organize a panel on the folklore of women for the Nashville
 
meetings as well.  I
've written her correcting this impression,
 
and telling her that I have forwarded on her proposed paper
 
topic to you.
 
I do hope that somebody is organizing such a session and that
 
my delay in getting this off to you will not eliminate Dr.
 
Hostettler's paper from consideration.  Or perhaps you can
 
work it in to some other grouping?
 
Ralph Rinzler and I have been in touch several times since I
 
last wrote.  I am sure he will be sending you specifics on
 
how the film and folklore session is coming along quite soon.
 
Cordially,

i of a local fiddler from Oklahoma that I
 
mentioned to you on the phone some months ago.
 It's not a very com-
plicated idea -
-
 just a straight-forward documentation of his style
 
with what he has to say about technique and what he thinks is impor-
tant about fiddle-playing for commentary.  We have two working titles,
 
both names of his favorite tunes -
-
 "Snowbird in the Ash Bank"(which
 
is my favorite but might be misleading -
 what do you think?) and "Say,
 
Old Man, Can You Play the Fiddle?".  Would you care to cast a vote?
 
We seem to be dead-locked.
 
C
 
Anyway, I think we can get it into some kind of shape before the Nash-
ville meetings, so can you save us a slot?  It will likely run around
 
twenty minutes (
I can let you know more definitely the length later on)
 
and will be in black-and-white 16mm sound sync.  Please let me know
 
if you need more detail or an abstract or anything like that.
 
Love to Kate and yourself,

I am writing at the request of an old friend of mine, Professor Joan
 
Rayfield of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, York Univer-
sity, Toronto, Canada.  Professor Rayfield is currently in Abidjan,
 
in the Ivory Coast, where she has been studying the effects of urbani-
zation on tribalism (
or should that be put the other way round?) for
 
the past year.
 
In any event, she has been recording, in her spare time, the street
 
music of Abidjan and has become particularly interested in the effect
 
of the recent introduction of the guitar on the native music system.
 
She bas asked me to write and see if perhaps a slot in the AFS fall
 
meetings could be reserved for a paper tentatively titled "Street
 
Music of Adjame" (
the quarter of Abidjan where she has been living ).
 
Though I admit this sounds a bit esoteric for AFS, I am quite sure
 
Professor Rayfield would have some interesting things to say.  She
 
has, by the way, read a paper at the last two national meetings, both
 
i on an aspect of folk tale, if I recall correctly; and, though actually
 
an anthropologist, I think she has gotten to like folklorists and.
 
looks forward to our meetings.
 
Perhaps you would be able to drop her a line yourself and let her
 
know directly whether or not some aspect of this topic could be fit-
ted in; she says she will send an abstract as soon as she hears from
 
you.  She can be addressed:
 
Professor Joan Rayfield
 
a/s Ambaseade du Canada
 
B.P. 21-194
 
Abidjan, Ivory Coast
 
As for my own plans, I spoke to Ralph Rinzler several months ago about
 
a film I
'm working on, and I
'll be in correspondence with him soon.
 
Your advance notice makes the meetings sound most exciting, and I
'm
 
looking forward to seeing you in Nashvilleiin the fall.

Dear Bess:
 
How foolish that those existentialists should be so
 
right about human communication.
 I would so liked to have
 
benefitted from your point of view on the panel,  but I
 
didn't want to be any more pushy than I was on the phone.
 
Having replied to your reservations about the idea with
 
all of the reasons why I felt your role on the panel was
 
a unique one,  I assumed when I didn't hear from you,
 
that you had taken that all into consideration and decided
 
against participating in either the panel or the showing
 
session perhaps because you were already involved in
 
another session.
 
I do think we can plan to screen the fiddler film
 
on Friday evening unless I am miscalculating the length
 
of Sorensen's "Growing Up As A Fore."
 Please bring it
 
along and plan on showing and talking about it.
 I can
 
provide a thumbnail rationale for the films selected
 
which may help you in preparing your comments.
 
The three films chosen represent:
 ethno-biography,
 
Imaginero; technography,  bread baking film;  behavioral
 
documentation,  Fore film.
 Introductory comments and
 
discussion following screening will be directed at deal-
ing with the problems of each type of challenge.
 Your
 
film represents yet another type.
 While it probably
 
combines aspects of all three of the foregoing,  can you
 
introduce it in terms of the questions you are trying
 
to handle via film which audio-recording,  still photo-
graphy,  and verbal description are inadequate to answer?
 
Looking forward to Nashville.
 
Love,
 
U

Dear Mr. Wiggins:
 
I doubt very much that you would remember it, but I introduced myself
 
to you last fall at the AFS meeting in Nashville, after having heard
 
that you were researching the Juneteenth celebration.  I hope your work
 
is going well.  I am delighted that at long last someone is l
ooking
 
seriously into this important people's festival, and I do hope you
 
will let me know when the results of your research become available.
 
In the meantime, here i
s a proverbial expression which might possibly
 
be of some interest to you though you may, of course, already be ac-
quainted with it.  About two years ago, I had a B
lack lady in my
 
American Folk Music class who was, I should guess, in her thirties and
 
had been brought up in a rural section of central Texas.  Her father,
 
she told me, had a small farm on which he worked every single day of
 
the year, including Sundays and Christmas, with the s
ingle exception
 
of Juneteenth.  "Papa always used to say he wouldn't tell a mule to
 
get up on Juneteenth if it was s
itting in his lap!"
 
My very best regards to you, and I hope we will meet again next fall
 
in Oregon.  And if you happen to see Portia Maultsby, please give her
 
my greetings.

awes:
 
The review i
s fine--a good concise booknote.  Since number
 
328 of JP
.F i
s to be a special i
ssue without reviews, it may be some
 
time before this i
s published, so it you have any second thoughts
 
after using the b
ook a little longer, there may be t
ime to change
 
or add.
 
At first I thought you might have forgotten to send
 
page two of the review, because you neglected to put your name and
 
academic affiliation at the end.  But I suppose you just forgot
 
because you're on l
eave and also the review ran to the end of the
 
page.  Would you s
end me the correct affiliation —school and
 
c
ity—state —which should appear at the end?
 
You might want to take a look at a course in American
 
folklore I just finished for the University of California.  I
t was
 
opened to students on 24 February, and i
s numbered Anthropology
 
X
193.  I use my own text and Dorsois, and the approach is r
eally
 
more humanistic or literary than anthropological, but they numbered
 
i
t according to where folklore is in the California system.
 
Thanks again for your review.

Considering the antiquity and the simple availability of
 
childlore, it is surprising that American folklorists have yet und'
 
so little of the basic organizational work necessary to begin prob
 
this rich tradition.
 Jump Rope Rhymes: a Dictionary is t
h
 
attempt to present one facet of the oral literature of Enp
 
interest to anyone concerned with contemporary folkloric problems.
 
Those unfamiliar with the vigorous oral repertoire of American children
 
will find the rhymes contained in this book surprisingly varied and
 
complex; those laready working with these active and elusive materials
 
will find it an indispensable research aid.
 
The Dictionary contains 619 English-language rhymes from
 
printed sources, unpublished collections and University archives.
 
Representative texts for each rhyme are arranged in alphabetical order
 
according to first word, with a convenient system of cross-referencing.
 
Though the focus of the Dictionary is on verbal material, there is a
 
useful appendix covering jump rope games which have no associated
 
and the tech&ical terms connected with the playing of rope
 gam(
.
-,
 
texts
 
he
 
overall bibliography is scholarly and far-ranging, leading the reader
 
to sources not often examined for folkloric materials.
 
The Introduction includes a critical evaluation of prior
 
theoretical articles and classification methods for this genre of play,
 
alon'- '
irh some suggestions for future resea rch.
 As a long-time admirer
 
of  .
'
.
 •rahams' stimulating and creative theoretical contributions.  I
 
only wish that -
-
 at the risk of lily-gilding -
-
 he had indulged himself

 of Roger D

 new book JUMP—ROPE
 
RHYMES: A DICTIONARY?  Since i i

paragraph limited to one typed page, in the same format
 
as regular

of the book as you choose t

Dear E1Iei:
 
I was puttind s
o:
 thin
 nay this morning and came upon your letter again,
 
and it dawned upon me that I had pulled a completely typical stunt --
gotten interested in the problem suggested, thought about it, pronounced
 
judgment in terms somewhat suggestive of the sermon on the mount, and
 
completedly neglected to answer the question involved.  I
'm really sorry.
 
What you wanted to know was whether or not fotthought you were contributing
 
to disorganized discussion at AFS board meetings, and what I intended to
 
says was not any more than anybody e
lse, given the peculiar nature of the
 
pE blem a*n èIua ion.  But then I got interested in just why thtt s
ituation
 
is the  ay i
t i
s, and I forgot to respond in ordinary confortable huan
 
terms.
 
j
 
God knows we all could "get further and smell better" as Huddie Ledbetter
 
used to say, but I think all of us on the Board do pretty well on the
 
whole.  I think you feel particularly uncomfortable having been put
 '
 
the board to do a job you didn't want and don't feel comfortable with;
 
maybe in time you'll be able to relax in the affection and e
steem all
 
the board obviously feels for you.  The old bus keeps on wobbling down
 
the road, and the particular jobs each one does to keep her running don't
 
seem to matter so much as the love and concern each one of us brings t
 
the problem.  And you've cettainly shown yours in hundreds of ways.
 
ell, I just wanted to let you know of my personal concern for you and
 
to apologize if I sounded Olympian in my last, as I have an uncontortahie
 
feeling I did.  I
'll l
ook to see you a
t the nidyear meeti ng.

Dear E
llen:
 
�
1/
 
The problem about our meetings revolves, a
s I see i
t, around a number of
 
factors:
 
a
.  We are dealing with an organization which only exists a few days
 
a year; thus we have to bring our naturally varying perspectives into synch
 
with each other in a tearing hurry -
-
 i
t's a wrenching profess when done under
 
such pressure and hard on the ego.
 
b
.  We are a
ll teachers and thus have a fair component of ham in our
 
makeups; we are a
lso a
ll of us professional explainers.  The explanatory com-
municative s
tyle, s
o beautifully adaptive for the c
lassroom, gets in the way
 
of decision-making; i
t brings in too many factors and blurs the outline of the
 
problem.  And seven or e
ight people, all explaining things to each other, are
 
about s
ix too many and take up all the free air time.
 
c
.  All board members are hard-pressed professionals, deeply involved
 
in developing and maintaining our professional commitments, required to teach,
 
write, publish, e
dit, counsel.  All these commitments necessarily come before
 
our c
ommitment t
o AFS which we a
ll love and are honored to serve but can never
 
afford to place f
irst i
n our thinking.  Thus we a
ll arrive at meetings loaded
 
with guilt in varying degrees; this takes time to dissipate.
 
d
.  As Americans, we have been trained in the principles of representative
 
government; thus each one of us, I suspect, feels responsible to a number of
 
vaguely defined constituencies which cross-cut the Association in a number of
 
ways: s
tudents, women, e
thnic minorities, teachers, e
tc.  Finding appropriate
 
ways t
o voice the concerns of these ever-shifting groups within the constraints
 
of an academic organization which is s
imultaneously both powerful and powerless
 
is mind-boggling, and we don't do it very well, and we all feel bad about i
t.
 
Ergo, more guilt, and more explanations.
 
e
.  All of us are folklorists, which means that to one degree or another
 
we are dealing e
very day with the e
ssential human message system; and the
 
messages are a
ll s
imple (
no matter how disguised) and all emotional: grief,
 
despair, passion, dread, joy, terror.  All of us really understand these messages;
 
we receive them, even if we say we don't or hide them under endless citations
 
and references and analyses.  Alan thinks this is why we all come to meetings -
-
so we can hug each other and say i
t's really all right.  I
t's too much for anyone
 
to bear a
lone.  At no other meetings than AFS do I ever see people behaving as
 
badly a
s Herb Halpert at the last banquet or as splendidly as Dell; I suspect
 
t
hey represent two s
ides of the same coin.  Anthropologists and ethnomusicologists
 
e
t off easy.
 
So -
-
 you asked what I think, and that's the way i
t seems t
o me.  As to
 
what we can do a
bout i
t, I don't know.  I
t doesn't s
eem to me that i
t's a
ll bad.
 
L
ove,
 
P
.S.  On re-reading this, i
t all sounds a bit rhetèrical and omniscient; actualty,
 
I
 had been thinking about a
ll this for some t
ime and welcomed a chance to unscramble
 
my muddled notions.  Thank you for g
iving me a chance to do my own ventilating!

Dear Bess:
 
This is a strange letCer for me to write, and although it is on official
 
stationary it is very personal.
 (I managed to get stuck in Salt Lake
 
City--rather the plane did--so I got in about 4
:00 a m and am trying ta
 
stay awake sitting in my office right now)
 
I respect your powers of observation and your advice and I know that
 
you have been as dissatisfied as I at Exec. Bd. meetings--we all have
 
probably felt something was wrong but somehow we have not been able
 
to abstract ourselves from our behavior to improve it.  What I simp ;
 
want to ask you is what you think is going on, and, personally, wha
 
way might I attempt to change my behavior at the meetings so that
 
things can improve.  As I see it we need a "leader" (as Elli put it
 
and we should not indulge in wanderings and interruptic
--D
 
I suppose, which comes from feeling lack of leadersiiip.
 
3
o do advise me.
 It is possible to modify behavior and you are a
 
kind and accurate observer.
 I am writing this, dead tired, since
 
I really did not like the feeling I had of the diffusion and confu:
:
 
of the last meeting and also the feeling that I sort of was a major
 
contributor to it.
 In a way, I supp ose
, I jus t fee l stup
id-- like  tD  
matter that I know I have gets little use at those meetings--and yet
 
I feel no great emotional involvement even though I d
 
Chat somethings should get done to make things better.
 
It was very good to see you, and I do hope you will be able to answer
 
request for advice--but if you feel that you can't answer, don't both
 
yourself with it.

Dear Bess:
 
Your letters were a great help to me; I have tremendous respect for anyone
 
who has such an enormous capacity for empathy and analysis blended within one
 
soul.  The year has swirl
-led about me so quickly that I hadn't realized how
 
much time had passed since I wrote you and received both of your letters.
 
You know, your analysis, description--call it what you want--of the meetings i
s
 
so very true.  And you are right, the fact that we need to (
some do) embrace
 
each other so much does serve as an index of how much we want to be told that
 
we are "all right."  But I suppose that the sad thing about the AF
'S is that it
 
is getting older--way behind in terms of time, those other "professional" organizati s--
.
 
and although the personnel will remain the same for a while, the same needs will
 
not be able to be met.  No wonder at the anxiety.  And, yes, we come to t
hese
 
meetings (
I do) with too much of a sense of responsibility and guilt and do
 
what we are supposed to do best--explain.  That is really a fine insight; it
 
has been in my mind ever since your letter #1 arrived.  I would add, though,
 
that there are two types (at lease) of explainers: rationalizers and teachers.
 
It is a sly craft to learn and a difficult life task to perceive when one passes
 
over the grey area.
 
I wrote you after the meetings since I am both fairly open and also have been
 
"on the road" so to speak, for three year s
.  With ou t roo
ts
,  I tend  to  wonder
 why  
I should be taking up space which could be well occupied by someone else--not
 
that I mind existing, but I have to examine the rationale (and "emotionale") of what
 
I am doing.  So, in Portland, having just settled into a house (
still unpacked)
 
in Minneapolis, seeing the APS flacking out before me, I felt that I either had
 
to retreat or do something--obviously I have done nothing, and am still unpacking
 
and musing occassionally, but I had to write you, and you did me a great deal
 
of good.  Yes, we do all get along remarkably well all things considered.
 
Your second letter was one of the most touching ones I have gotten; not that you
 
said so much in it (which you did) but the very fact that you took the time to
 
re-read my initial letter was one of the most touching things I
've known.  You
 
have your observations on academics, and so do I
, and one of my more unflattering
 
ones (of course saying to myseli "all but thee and me") is to believe that they
 
answer letters and then dispose of them as a dose of medicine bitterly taken.
 
Your first letter would have been enough--lucid, humane, warm (no, not preachy)--
but your last letter was one of the most moving lessons I have learned in
 
my almost-forty years.  Thanks.
 
I could go on, but this might begin to sound like a love letter.  Have a happy
 
holiday, and remember that if y
rou ever find that you might be passing through
 
(or over)  yoij have an open invitation to choo se one  of th e four  bedrooms
 in  
this monster (
homey) place I now own with the bank.

Dear Bess:
 
It was good, as ever, to see you at the meetings.
 I hope you share my
 
good feelings about our work as an Executive Board.
 We came prepared
 
to get things done, and I think we worked out good ways of accomplishing
 
our goals.
 
Please let me know as soon as possible what your calendar looks like
 
through the Spring so that we can begin to work out plans for the
 
Executive Board meeting.

Dear Bess:
 
This is to let you know that the election for President of the American
 
Folklore Society was won by Ken Goldstein.
 Your willingness to serve the
 
Society has been much appreciated,  and I know that you will continue to
 
be active in Society affairs as you have been in the past.
 
See you soon.

From:
 Richard Bauman, Secretary-Treasurer
 
P1975 Annual 
J
  
Only a couple of you have sent me your thought
's concerning the
 
establishment of an annual moeting coremittee.
 To an extent, of course,
 
this is tied in to the larger matter of reorganizing the axecu Uve
 
structure of the Society,  so it will probably be best to deal with
 
it within that framework  (more on this below).
 
Although we have all but confirmed Barbara Kirsher' -Iatt-Gimblett
 
for the post of AFS delegate to the AAAS -- short of actually asking
 
her to take the position-- it seems to me that the point :
.aised by
 
Bess in the accompanying letter is something that desprves our ve 'r
'y
 
serious consideration.
 Barbara is cne of my dearest friends and closest
 
colleagues, but I personally find Bess'  argument persuasive.
 We can,
 
of course, decide to confirm Barbara for the poS4tion anraay, but per-
haps we might consider appointing one of our senior meEbers like
 
Wayland Hand to the job.
 
We have already taken a good deal of time in this matter,  and the
 
AAAS is getting somewhat impatient with us.
 On the other hand,  there
 
are some important issues at stake.
 Accordingly, I am tccking the
 
liberty of enclosing a special separate ballot on 1-his, return -
 
addressed to Dell, since he is the one who must make the appoint-ment.
 
This way,  a clear reading on the appointment is forthcoming, he can
 
go ahead with an appointment without having to wait for me to
 
transmit your feelings to him.
 If it turns out that we have to work
 
on it further, we can always do so.
 
AAAS Statement on Equal Opportunity
  
No one has recommended against adoption of the AAZ�S Statement on
 
Equal Opportunity in the Sciences and Engineering, but both Elli and
 
Barre voice reservations about the wor,7
, "irrelevant" in the passage
 
"
...equal opportunity for all persons, without regard to irrelevant
 
considerations of sex, race, creed..."
 The objection is to the
 
-2-
implication that there are thus relevant considerations for dis-
crimination on the basis of sex, race, creed.  See the enclosed letters
 
from Elli and Barre.  Perhaps Dell could convey our basic approval of
 
the statement to the AA S together with an expression of these
 
reservations.
 
ZFS Editor at the UT Press  
By now, you will have received a copy of Elizabeth Powers' letter
 
stating her intention to leave the UT Press for a lob in Japan.  She
 
has done an outstanding job for us, and I will be sorry to see her go.
 
I have been in close touch with the Press on the matter of her
 
replacement, and have some good news to convey.  Lois Rankin, who
 
held the position before Pat Walsh (
Elizabeth's predecessor) but took
 
a few years off to have a baby, is now ready and anxious to go back
 
to work and has been hired to reolace Elizabeth.
 I am as pleased
 
as I can be about this -
-
 Lois is 3 very  talented and experienced
 
editor, quite familiar with our pub1iohing program, ad a delightful
 
person.  We will be very fortunate to have her.
 
The basis on which she has been hired is somewhat novel, so let
 
me fill you in on that.  Since her baby is still quite young, she was
 
reluctant to work completely full time, so she proposed an arrangement
 
whereby she will work until 3 (
in staad of 5
) each day, with her
 
salary prorated accordingly.  Any wo:k she cannot handle will be assigned
 
to an independent copy editor under her suparvision, wi t
h the remainder
 
of what would have been her full-time salary -
-
 but no n2re--  to
 
be used fo': this purpose.  What this means, in effect, is that the
 
Society may actually get its editing done for less than we have been
 
paving Elizabeth.  Knowing how very e
:ficient Lois is, both Dave
 
Gilbert and I consider it entirely possible that she can get our
 
work done during her own regular hours.  In any event, it will cost
 
us no more than it does now, even if some outside assistance is neces-
sary.
 
Recrqanization of AFS Executive Structu:c
 
I have sent you Archie's memo on the subject, and enclose further
 
comments by Dell and Ba re.  It seems to me that we have arrived at
 
the point where the matter might productively be placed in the hands
 
of a committee, to be charged with proposing amendments to the consti-
tution or revising it entirely, as per Aichie's suggestion.  The
 
ideas, suggestions, proposals we have accumulated in the course of our
 
correspondence could be placed in the hands of the committee for the
 
consideration of its members.
 
Article VIII of our present constitution (
see 1973 Supplement,
 
p. 158), provides that amendments may be initiated by the Executive
 
-3-
Board, and if approved by a majority of the Board shall be circulated
 
to the membership of the Society at least one month before the annual
 
meeting, considered at the annual meeting, and voted upon by mail
 
ballot within four months after the meeting.  Thus, if we can get
 
and ratify a committee report by the beginning of September the pro-
posed changes can be discussed in Portland, voted on thereafter, and
 
take effect in 1975.  The elections for President and both vice-
Presidents coming up at the end of this year, as far as I can tell,
 
would need to be conducted under the present Constitution.
 I
'm subject
 
to correction here.
 
In order to expedite this matter, I
've included a place for you
 
to indicate your recommendations for the structure and membership of
 
the co m
mittee on the ballot for Dell.
 If we're going to get anything
 
done on this we need to get moving.
 
Parenthetically, i think Bess' point applies particularly strongly
 
-
-
 the senior membership must be solidly represented on any cor
n-
ittee we establish for the reorganization of the Society.
 
Conclusion? 
Well, friends, we have lots to do
 
to the issues confronting us to me and
 
I will be out of the country from
 
around to various Conferences.  Let me
 
Please get "our responses
 
Dall as soon as possible.

Dear Bess:
 
Thank you very much for your article.  I am happy tn

reference.  You were correct in assuming that some of your
 
style didn't match ours, but we were able to rectify it wit
 
some proofreader's marks and a retyping of the footnotes foo
 
double spacing.  In other respects, the article is an exce
 
one, made the more valuable for your own comments and sensiti -;Lh

I think the older fashion of scholars pretending that they the-
selves do not exist, or that they are not participants in the
 
process they discuss, has often led to barren articles.  I
 
think you have been able to avoid this trap in most of your, 
u
ork, and I hope it will serve to encourage others to stop
 
using distant objectivity as an excuse for bad writing.

This may turn into a book, (by the way, not a juvenile.)
 
I don't quite know what you'll make of all this.
 I
've never tendc
 
to think of myself as having "
 woman's interests" especially.  I
 
think it would be more accurate to say that I
've followed a fairly
 
:a
atic policy, doing what lay conveniently to hand and seemed t
 
ed to be done, letting my life pattern shape my research interests
 
ther than the other way round.  Thus, while my children were growin ( 
,
 it was easy to make observations on childlore; I notice I
've thoaiht
 
ther less about it now that they're grown.
 
The rest of your request is rather overwhelming; I don't  nea
 itc
 
where to suggest that you start -
-  particularly for information you
 
don't have already.  My brother Alan has come up with some great data
 
the importance of women in the communication style: very roughly,
 
t
'
:iat where you have, cross-
.culturIlly, women taking active part in
 
t
ire base—line economic activity (gatherers, gardeners, etc.), you have
 
the development of harmony in the musical system, synchrony in dance,
 
open—throated clear voices in the singing style, etc. etc., a whole
 
range of features he is informally calling "the feminine factor"; but
 
ll this stuff is scattered through various articles and books of his.
 
:
 could get you a list of the most important (from th1' point of view)
 
i you like, but it would take a bit of digging.
 
One person that you may possibly not be in touch  .
Iii is

at UCLA; she's working for her PhD at the Institute for Folklore and

'm sure she'd appreciate a

osition is conservative, both socially and folkioristically, but
 
she has a bale of ifnrniation on mythology and the folk tale and the
 
woman's role therein.  She's an old—fashioned European—type compara—

Dear Bess:
 
little note to ask some help. Karen Baldwin, whom we've hired for
 
L
his next year at U.Mass., and I are going to teach a course in the
 
fall called "Folklore and/of Women." Obviously,  since so little has
 
been done in the field in a formal way, we •
a n or task for the class
 
wll be to find out what's there in the way of primary and. secondary
 
terials. 
- 
.
e of the areas we want to explore, though briefly, is women folk-
lorists/anthropologists and male folklorists/anthropologists who
 
have studied women. We'd like to examine the question of "Women's
 
areas of study," the whole notion of "Difference" if there is any.
 
So, I'm asking for some help from some prominent women in the field,
 
of which you are one.
 
Could we have a vitae--or rather a list of publieations and areas
 
of research--for you? In the first place, it helps us mana e a
 
bibliography a bit easier, and in the second place, w(-
 
students to following througR
he idea projected abov
 
Second, if you know of some things we ought to look at  t
r
 
would not ordinarily think of, we'd appreciate the reference ,
 
make this request in the new FFC, but that will come out too late,
 
We've asked everyone who participated in the women's session last
 
year to send us their papers or any other research •
 That's been
 
fruitful.We are piling up bibliographies on earth of other ma er
i
 
I
'll send you one when we get enough to send-but there will be
 
we won't even think of. We're making it as cross-cultural a  we
 
can, and anything you can suggest would be a good lead.
 
1
0,we're really excited about the possibilities for the course,
 
particularly since it will involve the students in sornethin
 ew.

Dear Dick:
 
June 1
, 1973
 
I have plowed through the mass of material you sent me.  This is the middle of
 
exam week and my wits are perhaps not crystal clear; my impression is that there
 
are only two pending issues to which you need my response: the Smithsonian
 
research contract and
. the Cothran proposal.  The other matters (subvention to
 
U.T. Press, Applied Folklore proposal,  joint session with SHA, Folklore Abstracts
 
support) seem to me to be either on the fire or well and truly cooked.  I very
 
much appreciate all this information as I feel green indeed as a Board member
 
and every little bit helps.  However, should I have mis-judged things, please
 
drop me a line and I will weigh in with my opinion where needed.
 
I am enclosing my ballot on the Smithsonian proposal (favorable, needless to say).
 
On the Cochran suggestion to set up a committee on the teaching of folklore, I
 
find her letter extremely opaque.  There are many quite diverse problems such
 
a committee could address itself to; without some further idea of what she's
 
driving at, it would seem difficult to proceed.  I
'd suggest either that we
 
invite her to expand her suggestion before taking action or (my own choice)
 
recommend that she follow through on setting up a panel at Nashville during
 
which her proposal could be discussed by those interested and a program for
 
implementing it drawn up for presentation at the general membership meeting.
 
I have had little experience with AFS committees, but on general principles I
 
strongly second Bob Byington'a observations on committee structure and procedures.
 
Cordially,
 
Bess Lomax Haves
 
P.S.  I am sending a xerox of this letter to Dell Rymea.  I am not clear, however,
 
on the protocol.  When answering future requests from you, should I continue to
 
c. c
. 
 Dell or simply assume that you will inform him of the Board reactions all at

Dear Bess:
 
Well, it oily goes to show that f
olklore is net a sciecce,  administratively
 
as well as ether ways.
 hea I received ballets t
a.a most everyone else,
 
endorsing your suggestion of a
n elder p0rsi , - %

of Waylaid Si  the Ballet, I assumed that you would of c
ourse prove in favor
 
of that choice to., whoa your ballet came.
 
S. I respected is these tires, or .a that assumption, with reservatiecs
 
that grew into a decision to ask f
or a second r.uid

 New your letter turns out t
o r.c.w a
iad at least
 
half of what occurred to me t

As you can s
ee from t
u* letter coming from Dick, I proposed to separate
 
th* f
lee priaciple of recognition of an elder c
olleague from thi particular
 
comic.., because, with  all my regard for Waylaid, I ttde't thick that the AAAS
 
was the appropriate place; I did thick he skould wary much be asked to
 
join in the reorganization pl a
iuiag.
 
The best thu g to d
o at this point, it a
sses, is t
o circulate c
opies of
 
your further thoughts, along with my draft, and this reply.  We seem to have
 
tie following points:
 
(
1) the priccip].e of maixtaixiag contact between the geAeratioxs,
 
specifically in the term of appointing sexier (but still salty)  colleagues to
 
pesitieas such as these if AFSrm representative to ACLZ and AAAS.
 
[Nit.: we did di that with the ACLS, and my suggeateis f

Dear D
ick:
 
This probably won't get to you in time, but I do want to get in my two
 
cents on the matter of the AAAS appointment.  I d
isagree with the sug-
gestion to appoint Barbara K
irshenblatt-Gimblett, not because of any
 
objection to her a
s a person, but because I think this particular duty
 
and honor should go to one of the senior AFS members.
 
When I
 was e
lected to the presidency of the California Folklore Society
 
several years ago, one of the f
irst things I undertook was to try to find
 
out why people l
ike Wayland Hand, Al Friedman, Hector Lee and the l
ike
 
d
idn't s
eem to turn up a
t meetings they way they used to; and, in due
 
course, I g
ot a real earfull.  Basically, i
t was s
imple: their feelings
 
had been hurt; they f
elt superfluous, old-fashioned and a
ll-round unwanted
 
and that the best thing they could do was to get out of the way of the
 
young ones.
 
I don't have a
ny idea just how or why this happened, but that was sure the
 
way they felt, and i
t a
lerted me to the fact that our senior members form
 
a minority group with just as many sensitivities as women/blacks/Chicanes/
 
e
tc. e
tc. e
tc.  Anyway, all i
t took to solve the problem in California was
 
s
ome t
.1.c. on my part and a few dollops of the very best butter and, by
 
gum, back they a
ll c
ame, happy as c
lams, and -
-
 incidentally -
-
 providing
 
an injection of wisdom, intellectual e
legance and historical perspective
 
that our a
ssemblage needed badly.
 
I realize that i
t's possible for an organization to be totally dominated
 
by the o
lder generation, and we don't want that.  But neither do we want
 
the opposite, and I
'll bet there i
sn't much more than a ten year age span
 
represented by the present APS board membership; (
my hunch i
s that I
'm the
 
o
ldest and I
'm only 5
3).  And i
t seems to me that the AAAS appointment
 
i
n particular positively cries for a person with the kind of experience and
 
authority that comes only with age.
 
Anyway, that's what I think.

All the best,

TO:
 Executive Board, American Folklore Society
 
FROM:
 Richard Bauman,  Secretary-Treasurer
 
DATE:
 March 7,  1974
 
The Board was unanimous in approving the additional funds fox the CCAFA,  and
 
a check has been sent.
 
Six names were suggested for the AAAS position:
 Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett
 
(suggested by three members of the Board),  Roger Abrahams, Wayland Hand, Dell
 
Hymes, Alan Lomax  (who was approached earlier for the job, but didn't respond),
 
Don Yoder.
 The Board response suggests that we should approach Barbara Kirshen-
blatt-Gimblett, unless there are objections, say by March 21.
 
Concerning the meeting site for 1975, New Orleans received three endorsements,
 
St. Louis and Chicago two each, and Salt Lake City,  Detroit, Memphis, San
 
Francisco and Amherst one each.
 We have a tentative invitation from the
 
Louisiana Folklore Society which backs up the New Orleans suggestion.
 There
 
are folklorists at LSU, LSU New Orleans, and Tulane.
 No other invitations
 
have come in,  though it's possible we could stir up some local interest in a
 
number of the above places if we take the initiative.
 What's your feeling?
 
Should we pursue New Orleans or look further?  It sure is a nice town.
 
The meeting for 1976 has not been set for Philadelphia as I
 
can't extend an invitation until I find out whether we will
 
get Bicentennial funds for the meeting.
 We can expect no
 
funds from the University and the Folklore department has
 
no funds of its own.
 Check with Bob Byington who was
 
trying to get the Bicentennial funds for a Philadelphia
 
meeting in 1976.
 
Since the application for Bicentennial funds that Ken alludes to was not success-
ful,  it would appear that 1976 is up for grabs, as far as a meeting site is con-
cerned.
 More suggestions needed.
 
One further bit of  inform
a t ion
on
 
Now a related matter -- one item that we never got to on the tentative agenda
 
for our Nashville Board meeting had to do with establishing a committee on
 
annual meetings  (it was item I.A. on the agenda too).
 The suggestion at that
 
time was to constitute a meeting committee made up of past, present,  and next
 
program chairmen and the Secretary-Treasurer.
 One of the Vice-President's
 
Ust or 2nd?) would be an appropriate chairman.
 This committee could be
 
charged with selection of meeting sites, program and local arrangements chair-
men, and general planning.
 In order to make the system work, we would need to
 
have program chairmen  (and thus presumably meeting sites)  selected at least
 
two years in advance.
 Questions:
 (1) what do you think about setting up such a
 
Executive Board, American Fo1k.' ra Society
 
Page 2
 
March 7
, 1974
 
committee?;  (
2) do you approve of the committee format suggested above, or do
 
you have other ideas?;  (
3) what functions should the committee perform?  Please
 
note that the Board will have to choose the program and local arrangements
 
chairmen for 1975, in any event, but that should wait till we have selected a
 
meeting site.
 
Response to the question of holding a joint meeting with the SEN in Philadelphia
 
in 1976 was mixed, with two unqualified yes votes, three qualified yes votes,
 
one unqualified no, and three abstentions.
 The qualifications were:
 (
1) let's
 
go easy if it makes our organizational problems more difficult;  (
2) it's only
 
worthwhile if we're housed in the same or immediately adjacent hotels;  (
3) we
 
should set the dates.  Of course, this all becomes moot if we don't meet in
 
Philadelphia.
 I
'll keep an eye on possibilities and developments and see what
 
the prospects are.
 
A number of good comments and suggestions came in concerning the organization
 
and activity of the Executive Board.  Bob Byington and Archie Green promise
 
memos later on; the following are the responses that did come in:
 
Elli Maranda: Create a Past-President's office,  for one year after
 
activity as President; and President-Elect's office for one year
  
before presidency.
 
Ellen Stekert: The matter of how and when bids for meeting places
 
are handled must be formalized and the racial memory of how to
 
run them must be passed on.
 Dell appointed a committee (
I thought)
 
at the last meeting, including Cain Collins and Bill Ivey, to help
 
formalize the meeting procedures.  Why not have one of the VP's
 
as the chairman of that committee and also be responsible for
 
coordinating the meetings.  The other VP might be in charge of
 
coordinating (
and spurring on) all other committees.  Both
 
should be in communication re their activities with the Executive
 
Board, and have any major decisions ok'd by the Board.
 
The President should have at least a four year term, but I think
 
he should then be allowed to remain as a voting member on the
 
Executive Board (
perhaps non-voting because of carry-over of
 
"power") for two years.
 
All new members of the Executive Board should be allowed to see
 
the extensive notes of the Executive Board meetings for the past
 
years so as to know what is going on and has been going on.
 
I also believe that we should think about having the Secretary-
Treasurership an elected office.  The position holds so much
 
power that it seems a poor idea to have it an appointment, even
 
if approved by a vote of the Executive Board.

Bess Lomax Hawes: 
I am not yet clear enough on the operation
 
of the Board and committees to want to comment on that ques-
tion.  Certainly, I
'd be personally willing to take on an
 
additional responsibility, but that's rather beside the point.
 
Whether a reorganization along those lines would add to or
 
decrease our efficiency, I
'm really not sure, and I
'd rather
 
uided -
-
 this year! -
-
 by the rest of the Board.
 
or the presidency, I would support the suggestion to make
 
o a member of the board for a year or perhaps even two after
 
is term.
 I
'm afraid a lot of people would decline to run if
 
the term were mandated for longer than two years.  We might
 
consider the CFS system of an optional re-election for a one
 
year term after completion of the two years.  That's worked
 
pretty well hereabouts; it allows the president to get off
 
the hook if he wants to, but still provides the possibility
 
of continuity when things are going exceptionally well.
 
Kenneth S
. Goldstein: 
I agree with Ellen that the VP's of the
 
Society be given specific duties to perform.
 I disagree that
 
the term of the President be extended.
 In fact, I think it
 
should be shortened to one year.  I recommend that we take on
 
something like the AAA system.  Perhaps elect a person to 2nd
 
Vice President, the following year he automatically becomes
 
1st Vice President and the year after that President.  He
 
might then become member-at-large of the Executive Board for
 
a year, though I don't really think that is necessary.
 
Barre Toelken: President should have about a five-year term;
 
Vice Presidents should function (
how about starting with
 
taking the responsibility for annual meeting?).  We do need
 
a constitutional amendment to these ends.
 Shall we introduce
 
one?
 
I
'll send Bob and Archie's ideas around when I get them -
-
 till then, let's
 
continue to think about the issue.
 If you have further ideas, convey them to
 
me and I
'll circulate them as well.
 
Finally, please consider the enclosed statement from the AAAS on equal oppor-
tunity (accompanied by cover letter from AAAS and reply by Dell), and send me
 
an indication of your feeling for or against endorsement, together with sug-
gestions concerning implementation,  further steps, etc.
 
Enough for now?  Let me hear from you.

caveat: I have applied for a sabbatical leave for the academic ye
 
1973..4.  Even if I get it, however -
 I won't know until July 15 - 
I doubt I will be out of pocket more than the average board menibe.,

should my sabbatical prove no problem, I assure you I look
 
to  oeving on the Board and will try to be as helpful aeppossible,

Dear Bees:
 
As you probably know, Ellen Stekert's election as Recording Secretrary
 
leaves open her position as a regular member of the Executive Board.  On behalf
 
of the Beard, I should like to invite you to accept this position.  There are
 
two years to the term (calendar 1973, 1974).  The duties are not onerous,
 
I think, though I hope to make sure that the members of the Board are involved
 
in all the issues that come before us during my term.
 
I hope very much thet you will accept.  If you could arrange to send a
 
carbon of your reply to Dick Bauman, Secretary-Treasurer, Social Work Building,
 
Univei ty of Texas, Austin, Texas 78712, it would be a great help.
 I am
 
in a cabin two miles out of Rhododendron, without any easy way to make copies
 
ot anything, unt i
l late August.
 
Looking forward to seeing you at the November meeting in Nashville,

TO:
 Officers of the American Folklore Society
 
FROM:
 Dell Hymes, President
 
SUBJECT:  APPOINTMENTS
 
Dear Colleagues:
 
As you know, a Member at Large of the Executive Board is to be chosen to fill
 
the remainder of Ellen Stekert's term (
through 1974).
 
In view of the concern of many of our members that the AFS do what it c
an to
 
improve the position of women, it would seem that first consideration ought to be
 
given to women in this case.  Two suggestions of women candidates have already come
 
to me.  I would be grateful if you would each let me know of one or more women mem-
bers of the AFS whom you think would be a good member of the Board, assuming that
 
you agree with the proposed policy.  I will make the appointment as soon as possible
 
after hearing from you.
 
Another appointment to be made is that of delegate to the ACLS.  In view of his
 
long and devoted service to the Society, William Jansen would seem a good choice.
 
As I understand the position, it is both an  honor
 an d a responsibility.  The duty
 
consists chiefly of attending an annual meeting, but the affairs of the ACIS are of
 
moment to us, and the voice and report of our delegate thus of moment too.  Again,
 
I would be grateful for your thoughts on this.
 
I hope I can be as effective as DK has been.  I know I shall have to depend on
 
the other officers a great deal, and even where an action is required of the Presi-
dent, as in the two appointments discussed above, I don't want to proceed without
 
having first consulted all of you.
 
One further matter: the AAAS is reorganizing, and the possibility of belonging
 
to more than one of its sections has arisen (we are presently affiliated with Sec-
tion H -
 Anthropology).  I don't know how many members of AFS are also members of
 
AAAS, and what their interests in AAAS may be.  We must appoint one delegate in
 
any case, and could ask for membership in another section (
e.g., Education might
 
interest those concerned with applied folklore); if granted such additional member-
ship, we could then appoint an additional delegate, i
.e., for the additional sec-
tion.  Maybe the AAAS is quite peripheral to our interests, but I would appreciate
 
your thoughts on it.
 
Sincerely,
 
Dell Hymes

This is to let you know that Bill Jansen has agreed to
 
serve as AFS delegate to the ACLS, succeeding Dick Dorson.
 
Bess Hawes has been asked to join the Executive Board to
 
fill out the remainder of Ellen Stekert's term.
 
Kay Cothran has proposed the setting up of an AFS
 
Committee on the teaching of folklore.  Dell and I are agreed that
 
it would be useful policy, when new committees are proposed, to
 
consult with the Board concerning advisability, and to solicit
 
suggestions for membership.  Accordingly, please send me your views
 
on the advisability of setting up an AFS committee on the teaching
 
of folklore, and any names which might occur to you as potential
 
members of such a committee.  To avoid undue delay, I would
 
I
,
 
appreciate having your response by June 7

interesting paradoxes.
 It is one of the few songs which clear
 
eaempitf
 tea all the criteria normally used in defining foil'
 
unofficial, in the common repertoire, anonymous, subj
 
variation, etc. etc.
 It is almost universally identif
 
layman and folklorist alike as a "folk song", though folklorists
 
have tended to ignore it, apparently because it is just a little
 
too anonymous, too common, and so forth.
 
In point of fact, it is indisputably a composed song
 
and has been firmly copyrighted from the time of its publication'
 
in 1888, as inadvertant users have found out to their financial
 
cost.
 
(The account of the negotiations between the publishers and
 
Western Union over the knotty problem of the singing telegram is
 
quite hilarious as far as I have been able to trace itj  I hope
 
to have more details by the fall.)
 
The question of why this banal little song has been so
 
enthusiastically accepted into the traditional repertoire can be
 
somewhat clarified through content, melodic and contextual analysis.
 
My general conclusion is that it is the most economical statement
 
possible of the crucial factors implicit in the United State '
 
single most vital and universal ritual.
 I propose to examine
 
briefly the symbolic behaviors involved in our observance of L
.
 
birthday and make some suggestions as to how both the
 
the song express the curious American solution to the
 
implicit in the phrases "an individualistic society".

' i
J nisoff does not dtamuzz treat th
 
Alii.

 az a p folkloristic phenomenon. He says nothing about thø
 
ara t3r  f their songs, bmwx 
tk&)
cz11xkzd 
x 
to 
z
:kradttteaatz
 team or
 
about how the group lived and •psrated as a groui
 
f composer versifiers.
 
The things interesting to the folklorist simply * &e are not commented
 
jon. For instance nothing is said about the 0rigin41 note struck
 
in the songs of Woody Gutbriea which has become a major element of
 
in the prosody of Bob Dylan and the hundreds of other conte
;t
orary
 
singers, who, like Dylan and Seeger, have injectcd
 notz  3f social
 4
 
protest in their songs. A critical look at Seoger,at the beginning of
 
long
 
his pre ugttsa career, would likewise have been very rewarding. Finally,
 
there is nowhere in the piece Vhe observation that the main audience
 
of the Alinanacs4 u turned out to be the generation active in the New
 
Deal, the same group that later was to become the liberal center
 
of both parties. In that day,as in our own, the protest song was a
 
a
 
cheered by aszzm * middle class audience. That outcome • which was
 
certainly a surprise to Seeger, Guthrie and their friends, was
 
probably the r*s it n
'ost interesting ,  if not ironic result of their
 
efforts, since they saw themselves as a uki waking music for the unions.
 
This is not to say ikat, of course, that such gromops as the
 
Almanacs and The Birds, are not suitable subjects for folkloristic
 
evaluated in folkiotistic tenus and
 
study. But, if  studied, the subject should be/handled with total
 
as well as with a
 
professionality u dxattkxa special concern for the human problems in-
volved. Where living people are involved and queztte u the possibility
 
of personal damage is in question, the parties concerned ought,we
 
- -at least
 
feel, to be consulted before such studies are published/in the
 
Journal of American Folklore .

Dear Dick:
 
As you've probably heard, this has not been a good year for me of my family -
-
brother John's heart attack last August, my husband's death in December and
 
now my sister-in-law's illness have kept me at a pretty high emotional pitch
 
all year and led in general to a bad slow-down in terms of creative work.
 
However,  I should like very much to come to the meetings next November in
 
Austin, partly for family reasons, and I shall need institutional support
 
in order to do so.
 There are two possible proposals that have occurred to
 
me:
 first, that there might have been suggested some panel discussions to
 
which I might be able to contribute, perhaps on the teaching of folklore,
 
games and play, the teaching of Afro-American folklore, ethics in folklore,
 
research and field work, or some such topic.
 
Secondly, I plan to spend some time this summer reworking a paper I delivered
 
at a meeting of the California Folklore Society in the spring of 1971.
 It was
 
titled "Folk Songs and Function: a Look at the Lullabye".
 I hate to suggest
 
what might possibly be considered warmed-over goods for a national meeting,
 
but I am planning to revise it rather extensively, and I think there are a few
 
good ideas in it -
-
 too many, actually for its own good.  My revision will
 
primarily consist of an attempt to work it around to committing parthenogenesis.
 
I realize I am late, and I
'll understand completely if there is no room left
 
at the inn.
 But if either of the above ideas are possible, I
'd very much
 
appreciate any consideration a bedevilled program chairman could possibly
 
show me.
 In any and all cases, best regards,
 
Cordially,

Dear Bess:
 
No problem -
-
 I can certainly find a place for you on the pcogram
 
for the 1972 A.F.S. meetings.  I certainly have no objection to a revised
 
version of your lullabye paper, and will put that down tentatively unless
 
you have decided on one of the other topics in the interim.  Please bear
 
in mind the August 15  deadline for abstracts.
 
I look forward to seeing you in Austin.

Dear Eleanor:
 
I recently wrote Dick Baumann at the University of Texas suggesting,
 
in lieu of a fresher idea (a commodity I seem to possess in short
 
supply this particular year) that I might present a revised version
 
of my CFS discussion on the lullabye at the forthcoming national
 
oeetings in Austin.  H ès accepted the idea; but I hate to chew my'
 
•hreds of cabbage twice in public and have since come up with another
 
o ibility.
 
notic3 you are organizing a session on the ballad.  Though, as you
 
know, this is not an area in which I claim any expertise, I did
 
collect a rather unusual version of "
.Little Mattie Groves" from
 
Bessie Jones in which, among other oddities, the little footpage
 
turns out to be the hero.
 It occurred to me that, in addition to
 
resenting a tape of Bessie's singing and discussing the song, I might
 
be able to add a few words either about the other known black versions
 
of this particular ballad, or on the overall repertoire of Child
 
ballads which have been accepted into the black song world, or -
 
s
ince Bessie has so clearly reshaped the'story to suit her own picture
 
of society and social relationships -
-  a brief discussion on the
 
importance of flexibility as a pre-requisite for survival.  In the
 
tatter case, I might suggest the title, "What Shall c
J
e Do With Little
 
i
lattie Groves?" and refer back to some of the problems raised by
 
L
iacEdward Leach in his JAF article of some years ago.
 
old this topic and any of the suggested approaches fit in at all to
 
the session you're planning?  Is it already over-filled?  Are you
 
thinking in terms of a general debate rather than a paper-reading
 
session?  (Frankly, I
'd hesitate to engage in a free-for-all with some
 
f you real ballad people.)  I
'll not be dismayed if you write me
 
that my idea can't be worked in, so don't feel bad about it if you
 
nave to; I can always save this notion foi
 other meeting and
 
fall back on the lullabye material for Auc 
But do let me know
 
what you think at your earliest convenien  ,
 ce I must tell Dick
 
what I
'm going to do by August fifteenth.
 :
.an reach me at the
 
above address (
I'm currently teaching summer 5eSSiOf
l at 1ortland
 
State University) until August 5th; after that, I
'll be taking a few
 
weeks vacation at the beach until the first of September -
 address:
 
Box 85,  Tolovana Park, Oregon  97145.
 
I hope your summer is proving a pleasant one, and that you are your-
self getting in a bit of r. and r.  I
'll be writing you again about
 
some CFS matters in a few weeks.
 
Cordially,

"The Volunteer Fire.
-an in American Broadsides"
 
Robert L
. Wright, Depart ent of Aeric n Thought and
. Language, Michi-
gan State University
 
Nineteenth-century American broadsi.es concerning volunteer fireien
 
may be classified under four categories:
 (
1) songs which praise
 
firefighters in general, usually stressing their bravery and inde-
pendence;
 (
2) songs which are pr i
narily humorous;
 (
3) songs which
 
celebrate individual fire c
ompanies;
 (
4) songs which attack the
 
reputations of particular companies.  New York songs usually stress
 
the beating of rivals through superior speed
. and endurance; in many
 
Philadelphia s
ongs prece dence !is established through an actual brawl.
 
2.  "  '
The Foreigner and the Finnish Maicien' Theme in Finnish Medieval
 
Ballads I
t
 
Inkeri Rank, Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Myth-
ology, University of California at Los Angeles
 
In a group of five Finnish ballads dating back to medieval times, a
 
recurring motif is the WaIvAng to young Finnish maidens against f
 ail-
ing in love or becoming involved with foreign men.  The stranger in
 
these ballads is usually identified as "Hannus, a German from the
 
Island,  thus reflecting actual historical circumstances in Finland
 
from the 12th through the 16th centuries.  The didactic function
 
and the strong characterization of bal
lad personalities, especially
 
the women, are two significant characteristics which distinguish
 
tiese Finnish ballads from
. the traditional European ballad.
 
3
°
 UP0jiy Oliver'*
 
Ann Aschauer, Department of E lish, University of Santa Clara
 
Although the folk apparently adopted
. "Folly Oliver" from broadside
 
tradition, the popular version has an introductory stanza which
 
develops both characterization and motivation and replaces the
 
bawdy innuendoes of the broadsides with a moral:  Folly, the faith-
ful and virtuous, is rewarded with marriage to her love and freedoa
 
from her parents, who a
re punished for their thoughtlessness and
 
cruelty.
 
4
.  "British Folksongs on Sexual Themes:  Some Sociolinguistic Ccnsider-
a
t,ions"
 
Roger deV. Renwick, Department of Folklore and Folklife, University
 
of Pennsylvania
 
Songs of sexual substance drawn fror& the British folksong tradition
 
of the latter part of the 19th century and the earlier part of the
 
20th can profitably be viewed within a framework of recognizable
 
systems of language signs, which correlate along observable lines
 
with differentiable social structures.  This delineation permits the
 
formation of a typology of such songs based on factors drawn from
 
these i
wo spheres: the syntactic aspect of the words used to signify
 
sexual referents, and the pragmatic aspect of their social contexts-
of-occasion.
 
5
.  "Scott's '
Jock of Hazeldean' in America"
 
Charles G
. Zug, III, Department of English, University of Nrth
 
Carolina
 
Sir Walter Scott's "Jock of Hazeldean" has been collected, along
 
with its predecessor Child 293 (
froxt which he borrowed the first
 
verse), from New Brunswick to Florida.  A close exam
ination of the
 
American versions provides some useful, albeit speculative, insights
 
into the folk aesthetic; but the fragmentary condition of the sur-
viving texts also suggests the need for creative individuals like
 
Scott who could periodically renew or recreate a traditional nar-
rative.

Black singer Bessie Jones s
ings a version of "Little iattie Groves"
 
in which, among other oddities, the little footpage turns out to
 
be the hero.  Since she h
o clearly reshaped the story to suit
 
her own picture of societyAof social relationships, this variant
 
nay well be illustrative of the i
rportance of flc ibi l
ity as a pre-
requisite for survivalQ
 
ar Eleanor:
 
As you've probaDly noticed, "
,
,hat L
1-ail r
ie Do  ith Litt1  Mathy
 
Groves?" didn't make it into the printed program.  However,
 
you and I were corresponding on the topic, Bauman invited me to
 
chair the section on "Folklore and Women" and I agreed.  My appea -
ance in the program in that capacity appears to have soothed the
 
kte Board of Trustees so that they arc nayin: my far
..; tia..
.
..
 
is well, financially speaking at least.
 
However, it seems to me that, having horned my way in iate to begin
 
with, I should now bow out and leave the time on your panel for tho;c
 
more prompt and efficient.  Your session is awfully crowded at best.
 
Why not leave it at this:  I s
1
U bring the paper with me and Stand
 
available to fill a gap in the event of a last-minute cancellation;
 
otherwise, I s
)nll save it for the next CPS meeting where I
'll inflict
 
it on you as a banquet address or some such?  Really, the latter out-
come would be fine with me, actually saving me later trouble, and I
 
do feel strongly that those who are on the program should have a
Ce-
quate time.
 
By the way, how do you react to the fact that the topic of
 I
'olklorc
 
and Women" turns out to be primarily "Folklore and Old-Fashioned Sex"?
 
Take a look and see.  I am not a really dedicated libberal, but I do
 
find this a bit irritatin, somewhat to my own surprise, and  specially
 
so in view of West's jocular remarks on the point in the recent 
letter.  S

through at last
 and I have just now settled on Sam Hinton for the

 who have been absent the last few years -
 with him.

Dear Bess,
 
As you can see from the enclosed, yes, your paper will crowd things up a
 
bit, but emphatically no, it fits in so very well with what I have in mind
 
that I can't turn it down!
 
I
'm not sure exactly what you meant by "
the importance of flexibility as
 
a prerequisite for survival," but what Charles Zug has arrived at in
 
attempting to meet my c
onditions is very much to the point--i. e
., the
 
necessity for ballads themselves to be so reconstituted from time to
 
time if they are to survive.
 (
I pretty much s
tarted this with the paper
 
I read last year, but I
'm pretty sure Zug didn't hear it, so it's doubly
 
satisfying.)
 
I hope that there will be time for discussion after each pair of papers:
 
the first two just happened to deal with the Gegnerschaft principle in
 
folk culture (
a tern I made up to go along with Ge einschaft and Gesell-
schaft —how like you it?) as it is manifested in balladry, the second
 
two with traditional and broadside conventions in dealing with sex, and
 
yours  will complement Zug's in treating the sigii icance of the individ-
ual artist in folk tradition.  All in all, I hope the session will either
 
c
iear the air a bit in regard to scholarly woolen-headedness about the
 
"folk" as composers of ballads, or at least generate some thinking on the
 
subject.  So please follow your last proposal as I have abstracted it,
 
and let the good times roll.
 
You've been at one of my Alma Naters (
I was in the second class PSU gradu-
ated, in 1957) while I was back at the other one, teaching Folklore and
 
Folksong; I did get a lot of "r and r" in the fore of preparatory reading,
 
and an heading for more of the sane in England and Ireland on Friday, on
 
an NEH grant.  One of these days I swear I
'll head for the beach myself.
 
You i
iake me very homesick!
 
For every reason you suggest, plus a f
ew lore, I think Barre a great choice
 
for program chairman--e. g
., a boost for Folly and her President in having
 
a program of unusual interest for their first venture, since I still cringe
 
at the memory of Santa Clara's.  It might scramble up the North-South alter-
nation, but perhaps that's not a bad idea either.  Anyway, I approve, and
 
hope he will accept.
 
Soak up a whole lot of that good Oregon seaair for  e
; it's the sovereign
 
specific for every ill I can think of, and I 215S  it terribly sometimes.
 
Luv,

Dear Mr. Pastors
 
It is my understanding that last November the American Folklore
 
Society adopted a resolution to provide $
 2
,500 as "grants-in-
aid to encourage members of minority groups to enter folklore
 
studies."  In May of this year the President of the Society,
 
Dr. D. K. Wilgus, appointed a committee, with Professor Bess
 
Lomax Hawes as chairman, to determine the manner in which the
 
grants would be given.  I was named a member of the committee.
 
As far as I know, the procedure for making applications is not
 
in effect.
 
oo have seen the item in the Washington, D
. C
., Chicano Studies
 
wsletter (
1:1).  I am, however, not chairman of the committee
 
and have no information on grant applications.  I do not know
 
where the editors of the Newsletter get their information, but
 
I hope they can attain a higher level of accuracy in the future.

Actually, my initial reaction ypon reading D.K.'s l
etter of May 18th was that
 
are being furnished with too little money at far too l
ate a date to be able to
 
get anything worthwhile accomplished at all.  I am not particularly b

I recall feeling at the L.A. meeting that the whole matter was
 
spelled out, and I cannot say that I myself rose to the occasio�
-i.
 
However, what are we to do?  This academic year being practically ov,
-r, if w
i 
are to make funds available to students during the year 1971-2, we will hAvr, 
to depend upon getting in touch with individuals and institutions during
 
summer months, and 1, for one, have a fairly heavy summer schedule ahead.
 
Personally, I suggest we start modestly.
 Given the limitations of time aut� t

ounching a campaign that would cost $500.00.  Why not plan -- once we have de-
­4ded what our proposal is -- to circularize the Association in general throu!�Ii
 
na announcement  in the Newsletter (I'll write John West for his deadlines to
 
see if this willibe practicable), and then follow this with a letter and/or
 
mimeographed announcement to those individuals and institutions where we have
 
nersonal knowledge that potential applicants might be found.
 Between the t
lirf
_­
us, I should think we could put these out under the mailing privileges o
 
­ir own home institutions and save most,  if not all, of the $500.00.  Perhans

Members of the Executive Board
 
I apologize for my apparent laxity in implementing
 
the resolution adopted at the last AFS meeting to
 
provide grants-in-aid to encourage members of ethnic
 
minority groups to enter folklore studies.
 My problem
 
has been to discover exactly what resolution was
 
approved.
 
As I have now determined,  the resolution directs
 
the President to appoint a committee to distribute
 
$2,500 for one year  (presumably the academic year
 
1971-72,  though the real restriction seems to be that
 
of the sum of $2,500),  to advertise the availability
 
of the funds,  and to encourage in whatever ways
 
possible the folklore education of students from
 
ethnic minority communities.
 
As directed by the resolution,  I am appointing
 
a committee to fulfill the obligations.
 The committee,
 
if all appointees accept, will consist of Gladys Fry,
 
Americo Paredes,  and Bess Lomax Hawes,  chairman.
 
When the committee has determined the manner
 
in which the funds are to be distributed,  announce-
ments are to be sent to appropriate institutions
 
and individuals,  for which funds not to exceed $500
 
are provided in addition to the basic funds.
 
The resolution requires that the/" funds be made
 
available first to beginning graduate students and
 
only in exceptional cases to students in their
 
second year of graduate folklore education.

Because the funding was approved for one year only,
 
the membership of the Society will entertain a report from
 
the Committee on Folklore Education for Members of Ethnic
 
Minorities at the 1971 meeting in Washington,  D.  C.,  and
 
must consider a renewal of the project.
 
Sincerely,
 
D.  K. Wilgus

Dear D
. K.s
 
Thanks for naming me to your Committee of Ethnics.
 
I hope it does not involve any work, of which
 
I already have more than I can handle.  But I
 
will do my best, hopefully, to distribute some
 
of the funds in Texas, which is
, famous for its
 
folksy ethnics.

Dear Alan:
 
Ax n xzkp ax
 ea i x x x
 
two months
 
About ax
kk ago, D.K. apparently came up with the notion that I do not already
 
have enough distractions to delight my r
tapij
ity old age and informed me that he
 
had appointed me chairman of a committee to distribute that 2500 bucks which
 
AFS voted at last year's business meeting to za
xki
x fx1R
x further graduate
 
folklore research among minority students.
 I wrote lengthily and obediently to
 
my two other committee members  (Gladys Frye and Americo Paredes) but have received
 
as yet no word from either.
 
Time is now a-wasting; in fact, i
t already was wasted
 zt
zt K when I heard about
 
the whole project, and I have decided to go ahead and do a bit of private explora-
tion on my own.  Do you know of (
or have under your wing) a graduate student, either
 
Chicano or black, who could manzaamexmmany not only use some money but shows promise
 
x of really going ahead?
 
kxewzsfxsxekzzexdxzXzi  Could they send me an informal lettèr of application together
 
with pertinent information concerning their academic standing, what folklore courses
 
they've had, etc.?  I think we might as well keep
 
it informal and easy, since there is so little time left.
 
!hz z

Please do not mention ammit specific amounts of money to anybody you might ask to
 
apply, since there has been no determination of whether or not the dough is to be
 
split and if so in how many ways.
 
itzi

In my opinion, this is already a botched job; on the other hand, things are so tight
 
all over that I would hate to see AFS sit around with money that they want to give
 
away and have no one get it, because the committee couldn't get itself moving.
 So -
-
if you have any other ideas of people I might write who would k xR know of wualified
 
minority students and who would actually get in touch with them and get them to apply,
 
please send me their names.  I am, as you can see, a bit annoyed with the whole thing
 
but I do not wish to let my annoyance interfere with trying to make some ! kind of
 
progress in this area before next year's meeting.
 
Love,
 
P.S.  I
'm writing J.D. Ekk Elder if I can find out where he is; also Dorson.
 
Due to a confusion over the minutes of the
 
197 Q meeting, the Comm ittee on Folklore Education for Members of
 
I1(
 
Ethnic Minorities was not appointed until the middle of May 1
1,
, This
 
resulted, unfortunately, in an impossible communication situation,
 
one member being out of the country and the other two already committed
 
to other full-time summer activities.  Therefore no disbursement of
 
funds was completed during the year 1971-2.
 Some exploratory work was
 
done and the Conunittee remains convinced of the importance of the
 
program.
 The Committee therefore urges the Association to implement
 
the following proposals:
 
a)  That the funds allocated for khm 1971-2 (
$2500 plus
 
$500 for advertisement) be carried over into the 1972-3 budget.
 
b)  That the Society allocate an additional sum
 
a x k for 1972-3 equivalent, at the very least, to the 1971-2 budget.
 
The Committee points out that $2500 is barely enough to support a
 
single graduate student under today's economic conditions.
 
c)  That the Society allow the 1972-3 Committee to determine,
 
out of an overall allocation, the appropriate amount of money to be
 
spent on advertisement and publicity, rather than specifying a sum.
 I
t
 
is possible that significant savings might be made in this area and the
 
jW-
ø-v- --
diverted to the scholarship program itself.
 
d)  That the 1972-3 Committee be empowered to offer not only
 
straight scholarship and support moneys
 
but also funding for potentially fruitful field research
 
projects to be undertaken by minority graduate students.
 These might
 
well be smaller grants than those necessary to offer as straight support
 
scholarships.
 If the budget is increased, as suggested above, the Coin-
mittee might thus be able to fund several smaller field projects as
 
well as one or two graduate students in residence.
 
e)  That the Society elect or cause to be appointed
 
L
.
 
At the National Meetings in Washington a committee for the disbursement
 
of these funds and that the committee be instructed to start work Un-
mediately, so that fruitful work may be
 during the academic
 
year in progress.
 
The Committee realizes the economic pressures on the
 
Association.
 However, in this area so crucial to the development of
 
our discipline and so significant to our society as   whole, the
 
Committee urges in the strongest possible terms the support and
 
implementation of the above recomm endations.

Ms. Marjorie McLain

Daar Merge:
 
Thanks for your good letter.
 I'm afraid that the
 
one sentence in your brochure that you, yourself
 
cuestioned - "KALEIDOSCOPE will serve as a presentation
 
arena for Smithsonian applicants
  
-
-
 does convey
 
the impression that your festival is an audition ground
 
for Smithsonian Festival applicants, and the impression
 
is strengthened by your reservation of Sunday afternoon
 
for "Smithsonian related performance."
 I think that
 
impression will have to be corrected in some way since
 
it is, as we both know, inaccurate.
 I hope this will
 
not be too difficult for you, but, whatever the
 
difficulty, I think you will agree it is far better for
 
you to do it now than to take the risk of our having
 
to make a public statement clarifying the situation.
 
The facts are these:  (
1) we will be doin g a
 
presentation of folk culture from the West Coast in
 
the 1975 Festival of American Folklife, and, very
 
probably, again in 1976.
 (
2) We are, therefore,
 
interested in identifying as many exhibitable examples
 
of regional folk culture as we can, and very much
 
ampreciate the cooperation of the CFMA in this effort.
 
Publicizing those facts presents no problem, but
 
to suggest that the CFFA's festival is, therefore, a
 
a
ii t
hsonian or even "Smi t
hsonian related 1
1 enterprise
 
oes.
 It immediately attaches to us a measure of
 
s onsibi1ity that we cannot assume -
 since we have
 
:ot been involved with that festival in any way -  
t
 must, indeed, explicitly ddny should it become
 
not touchy about these things, b

 I have been and will remain grateful for all
 
your assistance in acting as a clearinghouse for
 
proposals related to our Festival; I very much look
 
forward to seeing you again in April, if not before,

Dear Bob:
 
1
�
 
I
'm writing in haste to ask your advice on a matter of unfinished
 
business.  We had s
tarted talking about the Marjorie McLain s
itua-
t
ion but got interrupted as I recall; at l
east, I have no recollec-
t
ion of our agreeing how to proceed.
 
I gave Bill McNeill her name (
along with the various other folklore
 
teachers I know of in California) to get a courtesy Smithsonian note
 
about the upcoming central California presentation, and I presume by
 
now she has gotten whatever kind of formal notification/invitation
 
you send pf
t .
 My own feeling is that I would l
ike to let the matter
 
rest there.  In other words, unlike other people also on the l
ist
 
who I
'm calling up and asking for advise and leads, I
'd rather not
 
pursue Marjorie and wait until and if she calls me.  Unfortunately,
 
she is an academic climber of the first rank, pretty much out for
 
number one, and I don't really feel I can thoroughly rely on her
 
taste and/or d
iscretion.
 
I
n other words, to use a d
istasteful but accurate expression, I pro-
pose to handle her with a policy of "benign neglect".  If you feel
 
this would put the Smithsonian in any kind of a bad position, please
 
l
et me know.
 
I am a
lso enclosing, for your information, copies of correspondence
 
between Norine and Kay and me.  Perhaps you'd pass them along to
 
Charley Camp or B
ill McNeill or somebody in Regional America in case
 
there are any repercussions.  I don't really think there will be, as
 
I intend to do exactly what I say I will do in the enclosed l
etter.
 
I
'll be seeing you in a matter of a couple of weeks.  Perhaps we could
 
actually schedule a ten minute uninterrupted conversation then on mat-
ters Smithsonian the week-end of March f
irst -
-
 or hell, we could even
 
get in a bit of a social chat... I
'm beginning to feel I have no more
 
friends -
-
 only associates, or colleagues or something equally remote.
 
All the best,

Dear Norine and Kay,
 
I got your mailgram on the eve of the big three-
day mid-year AFS Executive Board meeting that we
 
hosted here,  and have just now sufficiently replenished
 
my reservoir of energy to answer it.
 
"What's really going on" is that,  since last
 
summer, we have recruited a staff for Regional America
 
which,  necessarily, has taken charge of the program -  
much to my and Ralph's relief.
 In-house are Rayna
 
Green,  Program Coordinator  (or she will be as soon as
 
the present semester ends),  Bill McNeil,  Program Admin-
istrator and Charlie Camp,  Field Research Coordinator.
 
In the field are Bess Hawes, Regional Coordinator for
 
California,  and Roger Welsch,  Regional Coordinator for
 
the Plains.
 Development of the programs is entirely in
 
their hands, with whatever checks and balances Ralph and I
 
supply when necessary.
 
Insofar as you are concerned,  Bess Hawes has been
 
appraised of your work and interest,  and received a copy
 
of your report together with my suggestion that,  should
 
any of your concepts or the communities you have worked
 
with be included in the final program,  it was important
 
and appropriate that you be directly involved.
 Beyond
 
that,  there is really nothing I can conscientiously
 
promise you.
 
The problem arises  from the superimposition of a
 
whole new system upon earlier fragments ci intended
 
4
1
 
-2-
program ming,  one result of which has been the abandoment of
 
some of those earlier intentions.
 I will be personally
 
sorry if the work you did does not reach the intended
 
stage of Festival presentation which we all had in mind
 
originally, but I can' t interfere with the plans of people
 
we specifically hire to run that part of the program,
 
either. 
I hope you understand.
 It is not as if your
 
fieldwork was wasted.
 
And things may still work out.
 So don' t repine.
 
As ever,

Thank you for your letter of February 12, informing me about
 
e progress of plans for the Smithsonian Folklife Festival.  I 1wv
 
-
 :
n advised in general by Dr. Job rt I
i. Dyin ton, regarding
 
ithsonian plane, and also b e been in touch with Norene Dresser
 
4 Kay Eardian,  X am pleased that you have included Bees l=ax
 
4-Barbara Rahm on your staff of coordinators.  with such
 
lified people, we cu* anticipate an exciting presentatio.,
 
s you may know, we are presenting a regional folklife
 
L
som, California, April 25, 26, and 27 of this year.  Dr. k inH -
 
indicated that he will try to be with us at that time
.  I encour
 
'
 you to do no t also.  T
he festival will include presentations of
 
i
ce, music, cr 4ta, and special demonstrations throughout the tbr€
 
y period.  Our festival will be a multi-cultural presentation,  te
 
-r
e alre ady many coxzltments from groups whose art is a vital part
 
•
 the cultural tradition.  Among those in whom you may have some in-
-
r€st are an Arm nian group from San ?ranoisc
-o, a black gospel gro
 
m the Sacramento region, Chinese dancers who normally do not
 
rfcrlA outside the Chinese a
ssociation, a German dance group which
 
-
 n integral part of  ktoberiest in the $acra wnto area, Japanese
 
II makers, 3cottish country dancers and pipers from the Bay Area
 
icar&o groups from among the emerging Chie no youth association,
 
-
iwe iirican craftsmen and dancers from the Sierra Foothille g 
ilippine dancers from among the Sacramento-Filipino youth, and many
 
3Ila u and demonstrations of traditional quilting, weaving,
 
.
dwork.tsg, and wild game bird oarvi g.  Included also will be a
 
-
-
 t
-
er of music groups, such as the fiddlers and blue-grass groups.
 
Because I an not free to pursue this effort full time and have

ecretarial help, I have delayed prepari j:

his re quires not oni7 pereonal contact and explanation to people
 
wisting to apply, since most of them are ooiii m ty people not

to you,  BeGause I am now pressured with last- m

understand what is being p

Dear Peter:
 
OH, ye of l
ittle faith, I have been s
itting here for the past f
ive
 
years at my o
ld address, teaching at the s
ame o
ld institution -
-
California State University at Northridge, Department of Anthropology,
 
telephone 2
13-885-3331.  I admit I did take a sabbatical a year ago,
 
but i
t turned out I
 was here a good chunk of the year.  I a
lso
 
admit my telephone number (
home) was changed, not by me but by the
 
telephone company; and they have a tendency to answer my o
ld number
 
w
ith a w
ide r
ange of cock-and-bull s
tories.  Anyway, i
t's now 2
13-
4
50-2113.
 
The other piece of news i
s that I am now really off and away again -
-
this t
ime on a year's l
eave of absence s
tarting immediately and ending
 
in September of 1
976 -
-
 to work on the B
icentennial celebration of
 
the Smithsonian I
nstitution in Washington, D
.C.  They run a Festival
 
of American Folk L
ife on the mall in D
.C. every summer, but in 1
976
 
they plan to do a real spectacular -
-
 twelve weeks, inviting every
 
American I
ndian nation, every region of the United States, twenty-four
 
f
oreign governments, the works -
-
 to participate.  So I fear I will
 
be hard at i
t on the east coast while you are running your affair
 
i
n L
ong Beach.  However, do keep in touch; you can address me at t
he
 
D
ivision of Performing Arts, Smithsonian Institution, 2
100 L
'Enfant
 
P
laza, Washington, D
.C.  2
0560.  Maybe we can work something out.
 
However, I have a more immediately practical idea to suggest.  This past
 
semester in addition to teaching, I
've been pulling together a regional
 
presentation f
or the Smithsonian Festival (
1975 edition) centering on
 
traditional arts of the central valleys and the coast*l regions of
 
California.  I
n the process of working on this, I
've dug up some really
 
exciting things -
-
 Portuguese f
ishermen from San Diego and dairymen from
 
Sacramento s
inging ancient Portuguese songs and carrying on ceremonials
 
tkat (
in connection with pig k
illing) that made my eyes bug out, Chicano
 
muralists in the heart of L
.A., Russian sects who s
ing l
ike they were
 
back in the Caucausus -
-
 all kinds of fascinating and absolutely here
  
"old ways i
n the new world".  If you can get down to this l
evel in L
ong
 
B
each and not spend a
ll your time worrying with disenchanted young
 
college s
tudents who want to express themselves, you could have a marvellous
 
festival and one that would be a model for the rest of the country.  I
 
wouldnt bring Malvina or Peter or me; I
'd put on for Long Beach the real
 
human culture of Long Beach, and I
'd bet you'd make everybody really proud.
 
You're in one of the great California communities; I
'm sure you could do i
t.
 
Anyway, to the practicality I suggested earlier.  My chief assistant in
 
preparing the California presentation for the Smithsonian is a young
 
woman named Barbara Rahm; she i
s probably by now one of the best f
ield
 
workers in the s
tate.  I
'd suggest you get in touch with her (
she's moved
 
into my house while I
'm gone s
o the above address and phone can reach her)
 
2
.
 
and get her i
deas and help.  You will probably wrangle a bit, I suspect,
 
but she i
s GOOD, full of energy, with a great ear, l
ots of knowledge
 
a
nd experience, and a real love not for humanity but f
or human beings.
 
I
 really recommend her as my surrogate.
 
I
t s
ounds a
s though you have some wonderful plans.  Let me just urge
 
you not to get s
educed by the number of youngsters you will find around
 
who play a great banjo or by the folklorices  with all the pretty
 
c
ostumes that the entrepreneons-of the ethnic communities will try to
 
put f
orward.  You can put on a good festival with them, but you can put
 
on a great festival if you will just scratch around below this surface -
-
and  what great training it will be for your folklore students to have t
o
 
go out and f
ind some real fishermen who really make nets because they
 
need them, not because they're called macrame these days. And when you
 
f
ind these guys, when you make friends and hang around l
ong enough, you
 
will f
ind they're s
till s
inging songs in Portuguese or Japanese or
 
I
talian, the shy f
lowers of culture that are stomped on every day by
 
our noisy s
ociety.  I
t's really been exciting for me to work on this i
cvcl
 
this past s
ummer i
n California; and Peter, i
t's a
ll s
till there.  You
 
j. 
P
 t
 -
,
 
a
s well, i
f you t
hink I can be of any help over this l
ong distance.
 
Actually, I expect I
'll be making a trip or two back to the west coast
 
during the forthcoming year, and when I do, I shall call you.  I
t was
 
so very nice of you to think of me.  My very best wishes for a most
 
successful festival, and please give my l
ove to 8h uPollec.  I hope
 
a
ll i
s well both f
or his and yours.

(
ercl.sed).  It's self-explanatory.  I called her to clarify the matter
 
of the meal per diem, and to explain that I had not w
orked out of my
 
home during the period of the fieldwork.  Perhaps the absence of a motel
 
bill created the impression that I had.  I stayed with a friend, thinkin
 
that was a reasonable way to economize a bit.  Louise conferred at lengTh
 
with someone else in the office, and said that the d
ifficulty was that
 
the Proposal estin te of $406
 total c
ost was regarded by her office as
 
binding.  I asked if she had discussed it with Bill McNeil and sh
e said
 
he had not.  Louise was very cordial, said she really regretted the 
understanding.
. b
bu
ut
t 
 that the position o heu of c
 fi:
 -

contract prices cannot be exceeded.
.
 
nclosed with Louise's letter was an invoice, which reflects the
 
expenses I outlined in my letter of February 27 accompanying my fiel'
:
'
 
report, minus the meal per diem.  I have not signed and returned it,
 
since I really do consider it to be inaccurate according tothe infor . - 
tion I was given in the initial telephone conversation outlining the
 
terms of the arrangement.  Instead I wrote the l
etter requesting an
 
advar e of $106.  I will resubmit my letter of February 27 toward t
le
 
niddle of April, subtracting any advance I receive, even though I do
 
understand that part of the expenses will be disallowed.  I feel it i
:
 
ore appropriate for the d
. crepancy to be dealt
 t
h by  r
ei t
hsonien
 
staff than for me to alter my own accounting.
 
To sum it up, I guess the difficulty was one o
i moo: plete ce:-
 
nunicetion within the staff of the Division of Performing Arts.  It
 
seems to be a question of what the word estimate means in the Propo
1.

Dear Bill,
 
I received the enclosed c
ontract from Charley Camp, and am enclosing it
 
signed a
s requested.  However, since my final field report i
s f
inished (
it's
 
also enclosed), it may be aasier to i
r
ake the payment in one lump sum.  As
 
you wish.  The final a
ccounting differs from the anticipated breakckwn
 
mainly in the amount of mileage covered in the f
ieldwork -
 Los Angeles
 
is a huge place, and I drove quite a bit more than I thought I would.
 
Here's a breakdown:

I r
eally enjoyed d
oing the project, and would be interested in under-
taking other F
rojects for the Smithsonian should the opportunity arise.
 
As I have already mentioned to both you and Chat
-ley Camp, I would also be
 
interested in knowing of opportunities for continuing to work for the
 
Smithsonian during the a
cademic year 1975-76 on a full-time basis.
 
Please give my regards to Charley.  I enjoyed meeting him and talking
 
with him out here in L

Dear Elaine Miller,
 
There has been a slight mix-up in communications in relation to
 
your Technical Professional Non Personal Service Contract.  The paper
 
that you signed and sent along with your letter telling of the completion
 
of your work, was the Technical Professional Non Personal Service Contract
 
Proposal. Usually when the pigned proposal is received, the proper
 
paperwork to set up a definate relationship between the field researcher
 
and the Smithsonian in the form of a Purchase Order/Contract is initiated.
 
That paperwork was not put through.
 
It has been typed and sent on through channels, but that in going to
 
take at least three weeks.  You will receive a copy of the purchase order
 
then you will have the authority to work for the Smithsonian.  The Federal
 
government generally frowns on after-the-fact requisitioning of services
 
and supplies which is what this turned out to be.  Such is the dilemma.
 
I have taken the liberty of changing the dates of your contract so
 
that your field work will start on 1 April, to run for a month.  You will
 
receive an advance of $106.00 as stated in the proposal upon receipt
 
of a request stating;
 
"Request for an advance of $106.00 to be paid to Elaine
 
Miller as per Contract #
  
The remainder due will be paid on resubmission of your invoice with the
 
contract dates and number.
 
One last point is in regard to your bill.  When a person is doing
 
field work and commuting between home and work during a given day, it is
 
not considered any other than a normal working arrangement for which there
 
is no reimbursement.  I am returning your letter and an invoice prepared
 
for submission within the contractual reimbursement parameters.  Change the
 
date and use some sort of personal letterhead on the stationery since in
 
this work you are not affiliated with SUNY, Brockport.  Also, please find
 
enclosed the receipts that you sent us.  We made copies, which is what we
 
need for our records and we are returning these for you might need them for
 
your records.
 
I realize that this probably sounds like an awful mess and it is
 
unfortunate that the turn o
f events was such as it is.  If you have any
 
questions, please call and I will try to clear up anything that is
 
muddled even after this communication.  I am glad that you liked the
 
work you were involved-7 n
-and hope you found it profitable.  You can call
 
me collect at 202-381-6517.

Dear Professor Bess Lomax Hawes:
 
In all likelihood you have already received an announcement of (
or read
 
about in one place or another) the recent agreement between the American
 
Folklore Society and the Division of Performing Arts of the Smithsonian
 
Institution. On the off chance you have not, I have enclosed a copy of
 
the most recent announcement.
 
The purpose of this letter is to explore with you the feasibility of
 
combing your archive for leads to the kinds of people and materials
 
that might be included in a future Festival of American Folklife. We
 
would like to know what your archive indicates might be "out there"
 
in the way of exhibitable folk expression and behavior within the broad
 
parameters of the Festival's four major sectors, as well as who might
 
be tapped to make contact with the folk communities, do what fieldwork
 
might be required, and/or generally organize the potential presentations,
 
which could range from blintz wrapping to witch coven ceremonies. In
 
other words, we are not only after plain folk, performers and craftsmen,
 
but also fieldworkers and "presenters"  (
as defined in the accompanying
 
announcement): and we hope that your archive can help us find them - 
particularly if it is so situated that its strength lies in one or more
 
of the Festival's principal sectors, Ethnic and Immigrant Lore, North
 
American Indian Lore, Occupational Lore, and Regional Lore.
 
The question is how can it be of assistance. Archives are organized
 
differently, with different retrieval mechanisms and procedures, and
 
we would not presume to suggest a procedure in your case. What we are
 
assuming, I guess, is that someone there is able to do the job, could
 
find the time, and would be susceptible to persuasion of
. one kind or
 
another. It is here that we need and would very much welcome your advice,
 
suggestions, comment and, of course, consent. We might hope that someone

would undertake this with gladsome cries for the sheer joy of combing
 
the archive, but you can't hardly find that type anymore, and we do
 
have some money to pay for the service. What we would appreciate from
 
you at the moment is your rough estimate of the value of your archive
 
to the nature and format of the Smithsonian's Festival of American
 
Folklife, how and with what ease or difficulty its information can
 
be brought to hand and transmitted, who might do it, and how much it
 
might cost. If you decide simply to turn this letter over to persons
 
interested in undertaking such an assignment, we would be equally
 
grateful, and I will be happy to correspond further with anyone who
 
gets in touch with me.
 
I very much regret the necessity of using a form letter like this
 
in a matter of such importance, but the large number of folklore and
 
folk].ife archives, private and institutional, in this country and
 
Canada prevented my sending an individual letter to each archivist
 
and curator. I hope you will respond anyway. My thanks in advance
 
for whatever help you can give us.
 
Si c rely yours,
