Announcer: The next speaker is a mother, director of the state federal birth agency for community
service.
Agency Director: The Jap aggression merely precipitated the inevitable war since there seems to be
no other way of people settling their disputes of all freedom loving peoples against the evil powers
of dictatorship and oppression. I believe that American womanhood, as a whole, feels ashamed and
humiliated that our one woman representative in Congress kept the vote to declare war from being
unanimous.
The Japs, or any other enemy with whom they may be aligned, will find us a determined, united
people ready to fight to the finish, their finish. I'm grateful that we have at the helm of our ship of
state at this time, a man of international experience, good judgment, and a man who is far-sighted
enough to keep us from being entirely unprepared.
Speaking for my own family, my husband, myself, four sons and four daughters: we all stand ready
to do our part in this emergency whatever it may be.
Announcer: The director of a private business school speaks.
Business School Director: This country, like every strong individual in it, will strike back when a sneak
hits us as Japan has done. Our return blows will have the full strength of all our great power. For our
spirit hotly resents any sneaking act. A clear understanding of what caused Japan to attack us will
show why we will never stop striking Japan until all danger of such attacks is ended.
The American way of life is at issue between this country and Japan. We believe in tolerance, equality,
and freedom for all. We believe these ideals should be followed in national and international
relations. So, for over a hundred and fifty years we have acted closer to these ideals than any other
nation with similar military and naval power.
Japan and Germany do not believe in our way. Both of these nations are now exerting all their power
to conquer other peoples so that they can suppress, exploit, and enslave the conquered peoples.
Japanese and German ideals of domination are being resisted by our ideals of tolerance, equality,
and freedom. Japan has attacked us so that we cannot hinder her conquests. Perhaps some deluded
Japanese have other ideas also. For I well remember when the California Japanese were joyously
"Man-on-the-Street", Madison, Wisconsin, December 9, 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941004_sr11
looking forward to the day when Japan would conquer California and all the Pacific Coast as the
western shore of the Pacific lake which Japan was to control as the mistress of the Orient.
To some the present terrible slaughter and suffering is explained in terms of fights for market
and for economic resources. But these people should remember that economic wealth is desired
for the wants that wealth gratifies. We want wealth so that ever greater tolerance, equality, and
freedom may be more fully enjoyed by an ever increasing number of our people and also by other
peoples throughout the entire world. The Japanese and German leaders want wealth so that a
limited military aristocracy may live in ease on the blood money sweated from millions of conquered
people.
We stand on our Armageddon, believing that the ideals which a noble man will strengthen our arms
against those who would degrade the millions they seek to conquer. The battles of the next few
years will be a turning point in our history for they will be our Armageddon wherein we will fight for
tolerance, equality, freedom for all mankind as well as for ourselves.
Announcer: A student at the University of Wisconsin, twenty years old, a speech major whose home
is in Milwaukee.
Speech Student: It amazed me the way the highly publicized invulnerable base at Pearl Harbor,
Hawaii, was so easily attacked. I wonder where our alert navy was. I'm not so surprised about the
Philippines, they're relatively close to Japan.
Certainly, the United States has no other course than immediate and complete retaliation to the
upmost of our resources. I fear, perhaps because of the eve of the Pearl Harbor affair, that the
United States will find it a long, hard job. But I have no doubt as to who will be victorious. I hope
to God that hemispheric isolation and other such queer ideas have now been relegated to the ash
heap of scrap treaties. Also, I pray that our legislators will not again fail to see the only method of
maintaining a peace after the termination of hostility.
