Interview 
[00:00:00] 
Sarah Filkins:  This is Sarah Filkins, Interviewer, speaking with Barbara Wilks, FAIA [Fellow 
American Institute of Architects] and FASLA [Fellow American Society of Landscape 
Architects] at W Architecture and Landscape Architecture in Brooklyn, New York on Tuesday, 
March 10 [2020]. Good morning and thank you for agreeing to share your story with us as part 
of the Library of Congress Occupation Folklife Project, funded by an Archie Green Fellowship. 
Barbara Wilks:       Well, thank you for asking me. I’m honored to be part of it. 
SF: 
Well, thank you. So let’s start out, if you could give your full name and your year of birth.  
This is as a point of reference for the Library of Congress in the future. 
BW: 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, 1951. 
SF: 
Okay, thank you. So let’s start with growing up and your first awareness of architecture 
and the built environment. 
BK: 
 Okay, well growing up and this will—a little bit go to why I am now in landscape. We 
lived next to a creek and so I spent, I would say more than fifty percent of my time easily out of 
doors—was constantly just fascinated by the natural environment, you know, ever-changing, and 
the water, I mean we had a gravel driveway. We were on a hill, the creek was actually down quite 
low compared to where we were. Anyway, I would spend hours turning on the hose and making 
streams through the gravel driveway which my parents, I think, must have decided, even though 
they occasionally told me to stop but I think they realized that I would just spend hours doing it 
so it was a good activity. So and then I went in the creek and there were all kind of animals and 
fossils, you know, animals from the past, the Ordovician Sea—I’m from Ohio thats—so had 
been all kinds of things that I learned about and I was a bit of a nerd actually as a kid. I started an 
Audubon club. I made dioramas of the Ordovician Sea and, you know, really was into all this 
stuff and so I didn’t really know much about architecture to be quite honest. I mean, my father 
had built our house which was a sort of a Frank Lloyd Wright kind of style and it was quite nice. 
And you know, I liked it but I had never thought about architecture as a field until it was 
recommended actually by my guidance counselor because if you had asked someone—
elementary school, that was my science phase—I thought I might be a geologist or something at 
that point. If you had asked somebody in high school what they thought I would be they would 
have said artist because I did all the—I painted, I was the editor of the yearbook, I did all the set 
design for the plays. You know, everything was about sort of painting and—so anyway, so but I 
also happened to be good at math and physics and all those things and so the guidance counselor 
said—and I knew I didn’t want to go to college in art. I didn’t think—somehow that didn’t seem 
like if you were going to go to college like, I don’t know—I’m kind of a practical person at the 
same time, so anyway they recommended architecture. So I thought, Hmm, that sounds

interesting. But I knew nothing about it and I went off and applied to three schools, I think, and 
got into Cornell and it was just the start of a whole new world which I really ended up loving. I 
mean, you know, they started, I’ll never forget, starting talking about space and I have no idea 
what they’re talking about when I was eighteen so just—just learning how to make spaces for 
people to be in and the kind of dynamics of that. To me, it was a lot like what I had seen in nature 
in a way, with how spaces change and move from one to another. So that’s a long winded answer 
but it was sort of by accident I guess you would say and nobody suggested landscape architecture 
so, you know, that’s how I sort of got into the architecture field as a starting point into this. 
SF: 
But at Cornell you must have been exposed to landscape architecture as well. Did you 
ever… 
BW: 
It’s so strange—the landscape school—Cornell is a very interesting institution that’s part 
state, part private and landscape is part of the state because it’s, I guess it’s more in with 
agriculture. And then, you know, the architecture is in with art and 
[00:05:00] 
planning. And I actually wanted to go there because it was in with art. So given my—what I 
thought—you know, my background. So the architecture, art and planning is what they actually 
call it. And it actually was, I think, a really good school for me because it was all about context. 
The planning and the Colin Rowe who was the person there then, sort of the guru. You know, it 
was so how things all fit together which was again, fit in with nature being more about systems 
and how that all works—so I actually think it was a really good school for me and I learned a lot 
which I sort of rejected. I mean, they were—some things I rejected immediately but nonetheless, 
the sort of discipline and the thinking about space and how people live in it and how we change 
the world through it and all that was really interesting.  
SF: 
Were there any architects who inspired you at that point? 
BW: 
Well, Cornell was all about Corbusier [Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, Le Corbusier], which 
I mean, he was pretty interesting. He changed a lot, you know, throughout his career—and not 
just sort of a single idea which—and yeah, I guess basically as I got more into the profession, I 
mean anyone that can sustain an idea through all of the things that you have to—I have respect 
for, because it’s so hard to—to  do that. I mean, they’re so many constraints, so many things and 
to first of all, just to have an idea and then to be able to actually take it all the way through and 
have it be expressed is admirable. So I’m—but I probably should say that there were hardly any 
women at [Cornell architecture] and certainly no [women] professors—it was all men—many 
times—I think we had six women out of our class of sixty as a starting point. Certainly, I’m so 
happy that it’s changed now in the profession but it was—I mean—I, I guess I’m the kind of 
person that doesn’t need a lot of—what’s the word—pats on the back, thank goodness, because 
you certainly didn’t get them and if anything you got, you know, “You’re wasting a space.” You 
know.

SF: 
Really. 
BW: 
Oh yeah, that was still very prevalent. I mean, or nothing. You know, yeah. 
SF: 
So there were no women, certainly no women mentors there? 
BW: 
No, no, no.  
SF: 
So what was your goal at that—you went to the five year program? 
BW: 
Five year, five year undergraduate, yes, bachelors of architecture because I’d, you know, 
been in school all my life at that point and I couldn’t imagine signing up for something that 
would require going to more school. So I was very happy to do the five-year bachelors although 
now looking back I wish I had taken more liberal arts so I’d—I sort of spent my time when I had 
my children, reading up on history so that I could not be behind there because I felt like I missed 
out a lot on that.  But um—now I forget your question. 
SF: 
Oh, it was just about—you know, mentorship and… 
BW: 
No, no mentors. No.  No and you had asked me, “What was my goal?" That’s what you 
had said. Yeah, yeah. 
SF: 
Oh, your goal, yes. Sorry. 
BW: 
I don’t think I had a goal other than to—I mean by the time I graduated, Diane and I—my 
classmate, Diane Cho, one of the few other women there—we decided to go to Baltimore 
together and I really wanted to go there, because—neither of us knew a thing about Baltimore—
but I wanted to go there because it was giving away houses for a dollar and you could—I felt like 
well, I could afford that. And then I could actually do something—I mean lots of drawings—I 
mean for me as an artist, I mean thinking of my, you know—at the beginning the kind of process 
of architecture is very removed from the actual making. I mean you’re making some drawings 
and at that point they were by hand so you know I was at least still making things by hand but 
they weren’t—and we did a lot of models so—you got to make things  
[00:10:00] 
but it wasn’t—it’s not the same as making a building so the idea of being able to get a house for 
a dollar and make it into a project was appealing. I didn’t have a big overarching goal, I mean, 
no. 
SF: 
But that’s so interesting that you would just select Baltimore and…

BW:  Yeah—out of the blue. Well, again…  
SF: 
Thank goodness for Baltimore. I mean really because you made such a big impact. 
BW:  Well, I thought it was a beautiful city. I mean, again with my background of context, I 
mean they have so much intact fabric, you know, it’s a beautiful city of mostly row houses, and 
mostly still there and they had really only recently demolished their downtown around the harbor 
but in a lot of the rest of the downtown—I mean the beautiful Mt. Vernon Square and many 
squares. I mean they had a sort of a history of squares so—and then of course the water being on 
the tail end of the Chesapeake there. So—and the hills coming down. I mean I just thought, I 
thought it was a beautiful city.  So but, yeah, again in looking back you just kind of naively 
launch off as a kid and not ever realizing that that might be a place where you might spend some 
time. You know, I certainly didn’t investigate it that hard. It was just like, oh they’re giving away 
a house for a dollar and it’s a beautiful place. Let’s go (laughs). So Diane and I moved there. 
SF: 
So did you end up getting a dollar house? 
BW: 
Oh, that’s a whole other story. No, because we were women. And this was Baltimore 
which I was starting to realize was quite southern, maybe not that different than other places, I 
mean, I don’t know. But, yeah, no we got—I saw—Diane and I were applying together to get the 
house and we got questions like, “Well, what if one of you gets married?” or “What, you know 
how can we give houses to women?” Or, you know, I mean just, things that we just couldn’t even
—I guess I really didn’t know how to answer. I mean we just probably sat there like deer in the 
headlights when people said these kinds of things to us so—so I ended up buying a house that 
was in rather poor shape. And well, I should also say, eventually they went to a—they got 
popular so they went to a lottery system and but then we couldn’t even win one in the lottery. 
SF:   
You weren’t even eligible to… 
BW: 
No, no they let us—they finally realized we were serious and they let us enter the—but 
we just weren’t lucky enough to win one. So I, I finally ended up buying a house which you 
know was—at that point I’d worked a few years and the house was relatively inexpensive and 
also in bad shape and it was just what I wanted. I could still do my project. So that’s what 
happened. It was only eleven feet wide and I don’t know—fifty feet deep with the whole lot.  
You know it was very small. But it was close to the downtown and you know, I thought it was 
wonderful and I had a lot of fun doing it so, but yeah, never got—the reason we went there.  You 
know—disappointing. 
SF: 
But a group of you actually from Cornell went there or just you and Diane? 
BW: 
I think it was just Diane and I. I don’t remember… 
SF: 
Oh, I thought David [Benn]…

BW: 
Oh he came later. They got married. He was in Ithaca and Diane actually went up there 
for a while and then they got married and then he came down and joined the firm.  
SF: 
Oh, I didn’t realize they were married. 
BW:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, so he came down then. But we started the firm and he wasn’t there, I 
don’t know, maybe for the first at least like eight years or so I mean, you know, it was a little 
while, I mean five at least—I’m terrible at time. 
SF: 
So but your first job was with the City [of Baltimore]? So what an interesting 
introduction to… 
DW: 
It was, and again I didn’t know. I wasn’t being strategic or anything as you would say 
now but it was actually a great introduction to learn how everything worked in Baltimore 
because I knew—I didn’t know how anything worked being right out of school. And I had a 
wonderful first employer, Franz Vidor. I’ll never forget him. You know, he was just the nicest 
guy and he said, “If you’re coming here to get a house for a dollar, I’m hiring you.” I mean it 
was just—he was just an amazing guy and it was an amazingly diverse place to work. You know, 
I got totally—I 
[00:15:00] 
got one kind of vision of what Baltimore was like and then when I decided, okay, I’ve worked 
here, I forget, for three years or so—I should go work at a private company. Oh my goodness, it 
was just totally different. I mean there were—when I say diverse, [at the City of Baltimore] it 
was women and men and African-Americans and hispanics and you know white people like me 
and there were all—just all different kinds of people and this was 1974. When I went to work 
three years later in a private firm it was all white men. I mean it was such a shock. So and I was 
the first woman they had ever hired. 
SF: 
So how about gender—were they supportive of you and… 
BW: 
They were in their way. I mean obviously they—the way I got hired I mean is kind of a—
so I had—I had a lot of energy back then so I would work in the evenings after I worked at the 
city, at another architecture firm, a small one—a person that just did houses and things—and 
then I also worked at a bar as a bartender a couple of nights. I mean just a little bit. So I was in a 
bar and this group came in with their jerseys on—they had just come from a ballgame and they 
were from, where I [later] worked, CS&D, Cochran Stephenson and Donkervoet and you know, 
I’m waiting on them and the one guy goes, “You’re obviously—what else do you do? You know, 
you’re not—you know what else do you do?” And I said, “Well actually, I applied to your firm. 
I’m an architect and I couldn’t get anyone to respond to my resume.” I think in Baltimore, you 
sort of had to know people, you know? And he—so he gave me his card

SF: 
So now you did. 
BW: 
Yes, so now I did. He gave me his card. He goes, “Well call me. We’ve actually been 
looking to hire a woman and, you know, we’d be happy to talk to you.” So I called him and got a 
job there. So, but yeah, that’s what you had to do in Baltimore so that was kind of funny. But 
they were—they were trying. They didn’t quite know what to do with me. I remember one 
project I—it was a small church, they let me sort of design this or let me work on this sort of a 
new small church and let’s just say I didn’t like the way the design was going so I stayed up one 
night and did a whole new design and built a model and did some drawings and presented them 
the next morning (laughs). You know and they kind of flipped out (laughs). Well they were very 
nice about it, I mean they didn’t—they just kind of, more like patted me on the head and said, 
“Oh yeah, that’s very nice but, no.” (laughs) And so but, I learned a lot—I mean I knew nothing 
about—when I worked for the city [of Baltimore] you know, it was more—I did do one project
—I met Moshe Safdie. It was really interesting because he was doing the “New Town in 
Town” [Coldspring Newtown] in Baltimore and so there was a city owned building that we 
renovated and—as part of that complex and I did environmental reviews, but it wasn’t like a lot 
of drafting and you know making buildings. It was all different kinds of things which was a 
really good experience but so there they really taught me more about how to put a building 
together and lots of red lines all over my drawings and you know, tried to get (unintelligible). 
They always said you’re very fast. I mean, I was always very fast at drawing but I had a lot to 
learn and so you know I—I enjoyed working there. I think they were very nice and open. I had—
but it always felt a little uncomfortable, I mean given the circumstances, you know, for me. 
SF: 
When did you take your registration exam? 
BW: 
Well, after I’d worked there for a while then I was able to take my registration exam and 
passed the first time. 
SF: 
Wow. 
BW: 
Yeah. 
SF: 
You are the first architect I’ve interviewed that has passed on the first time.  Everybody 
has these stories. 
BW: 
Well I also got physically ill taking it, because at that time it was like all week long. You 
know, like at the end I just—I really just lost it but I finished and I passed. And so not long after 
that is when I started the firm and then Diane who also had her own story, which you’ll hear 
from her later, joined me like three months later and 
[00:20:00]

we began Cho Wilks. It was first called Cho Wilks.   
SF:  
So that was—that was brave at that point to start. Did you have a project that you were 
able to… 
BW: 
No, well like I mentioned I had also worked at some other firms and at night, that did 
smaller projects. And I can’t remember his name but he was very nice and would spin off some 
of those small projects to us. Like because of this homesteading, they actually had a lot of people 
that needed, I mean a relatively lot, you know that needed relatively simple plans for row houses. 
So there was a market for small projects so, so yeah we…  
SF: 
Great timing then. 
BW: 
Yeah, so that kind of small project thing is what we got started on. You know, we did lots 
of row houses and then somebody, I guess, introduces you to different people. There were people 
coming up starting to be interested in Baltimore for projects so anyway, yeah, it just kind of—it 
was very organic—again we didn’t have a huge plan. It just seemed like there really, you know, 
like I said, as nice as they were [at CD&D], I didn’t feel like there was a future there. I mean 
there are other women that became principals, I  know like, Beverly, a women that they hired—I 
think she maybe—I’m not even sure if we overlapped. I think I may have just left but—so I’m 
not saying that it wasn’t possible but it just didn’t feel like the right thing for me. And it seemed 
like given this kind of—the way things seemed to be—that starting your own firm was the way 
to go. 
SF: 
Right—give you a lot more opportunity?  
BW: 
Yes, yeah, yeah. 
SF: 
Was there a particular culture that you two wanted to create with your firm or… 
BW: 
Ah, you know again, I mean we were just more, just doing it. I do remember at a certain 
point after about five years we hired a management consultant because, you know, we thought 
we were doing great work and nobody was appreciating it. Like our clients just didn’t seem to 
appreciate the great work we were doing and why not? I mean not that they, you know—I mean 
we had good clients, and it wasn’t terrible. But anyway, it was just funny. So we hired this—a  
woman, Carol McConaghy. She was wonderful. And she was somehow related to Roche of 
Roche Dinkeloo [Architects] but anyway, I don’t know if she was married to him but anyway—
she sort of taught us lots of things. One of which being you know, she goes,“Ok you take your 
car to, you know, a place. How do you know if they do a good job? Do they make you feel good? 
Yeah, you don’t really know if they—as long as your car just doesn’t break. You know, you don’t 
know how good a job they do. You know—you know from other things.” And so we started 
understanding about client management which we did not understand. We just thought it was all 
about doing the project. So you start learning about communicating a little bit better. And yeah, 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020

just managing their expectations and just things that seem so obvious now but when you’re 
starting you don’t really understand, so yeah, she was really good. She gave us lots of really 
good basic information and really since then I don’t think I’ve heard a lot, you know, new. I 
mean she really covered all the basic stuff with us so that was a big help. So, I forget what your 
question was again. Did I answer it? 
SF: 
Yes, yes you did. It was about the office culture. So how did you divide your 
responsibilities between the two of you? Did one of you tend to gravitate towards design and the 
other project management or you both had your own projects? 
BW: 
Well in the end, but actually she was better at finishing and I was better at starting, maybe 
is sort of an early—we really worked on them together. But I would say that was—she was a 
little more detail oriented and I was a little more big picture. But we didn’t have separate tasks at 
that point, you know. We both just worked on everything and did everything and as we grew and 
the firm matured and we had more principals and we started giving people tasks 
[00:25:00] 
—different like Diane I think was human resources and I think she did more of the business. I 
was like strategy and marketing. Oh, no maybe Dave was human resources, that’s right. So we 
would divide up those kind of administrative tasks. 
SF: 
But you tended towards being the person to try to bring in the work? 
BW: 
Yeah, well we all did, again. I mean it was more that you were in charge of organizing it 
or making people think about it or, you know, it wasn’t that you did it all, I mean, for all those 
things. So we did—I think we’ve always had a fairly horizontal, you know, kind of structure in 
that firm as well as the ones I have here now—not so hierarchical or this is your job, you know. 
Any good idea from anywhere is always welcome. So. 
SF: 
So as the firm evolved then, how—how many people eventually at Cho Wilks and Benn? 
BW: 
Oh, I think we got up to like forty at one point and then—so then, you know, it started to 
kind of fracture into “Dave’s Studio,” “Barb’s Studio” as opposed to being the collaborative 
structure that Diane and I, I would say started with and I frankly preferred. So that was probably 
part of—but I mean, I think I really decided to go on to New York just because my kids grew up 
and I had been in Baltimore, a place that I’d never even (laughs), you know, thought that hard 
about coming to, to begin with. I was just ready to move on to a different place, so yeah. 
SF: 
What were some of the projects that you had at Cho Wilks and Benn? Are there any that 
come to mind?

BW: 
I worked a lot at the Bryn Mawr School, Barbara Chase, an amazing client. Yeah, she was
—I really that’s some of my work I’m most proud of—the dance studio, the library. We did the 
administration building just when I was leaving. You know, she was—a science addition, that 
was great to the elementary school. The what’s his name’s building, I can’t think of it right now 
but anyway, she was a wonderful client, repeat client, and very supportive and not surprising at a 
girl’s school. And unfortunately then she also, she left just about the time, I can’t remember if it 
was before or after—but anyway she went off to Andover, I guess, Andover or Exeter or one of 
those. But anyway, so Baltimore lost a really good person but I’m sure the school went on. But 
so those were some of my favorite projects. I mean, I also worked on Camden Yards. That was a 
great experience. The light rail—Central Corridor Light Rail—we were the architects among all 
these engineers. That was a really great experience in big systems, you know, and I think we did 
a good job. Work on the Gwynns Falls Greenway. We were just a sub on that one to someone 
else, I can’t remember, but we did a little pavilion which I’m proud of. And it was a good, fun 
project and an important one I think for the City. It was the first part of that greenway/bike trail. 
Worked on Sandtown-Winchester with the Enterprise [Foundation]. We did a lot of work with 
Jim [James W.] Rouse at Brown’s Arcade when he first started. Our offices were there after we 
did it and that was one of the early downtown renovations and was obviously a thrill to work 
with him. I mean he was an inspiring person, just worked so hard and that he wanted at that point 
in his life to start a whole new company to give money back. It was great. So I had a lot of really 
wonderful experiences. I’m sure there’s a lot more that just aren’t coming to mind at the moment 
but… 
SF: 
So, while you were still a partner at Cho Wilks and Benn, then you decided to go to 
University of Pennsylvania? 
BW: 
Oh, yes. That was during the recession. 
SF: 
So did you actually move to Philadelphia or were you… 
BW: 
No, no, I just commuted because I had young—I had my children around ten, ten-ish at 
that point. So  
[00:30:00] 
yeah, it was like we really were just twiddling our thumbs and this was early nineties and I  
said, “You know, we always talked about taking sabbaticals, and would you mind? Maybe I’ll do 
it because we don’t need three of us sitting here twiddling our thumbs.” So they said fine and so I 
went off and the two years—actually I was able to do work part-time after the first couple of 
semesters because you know so much more as an older student. So because I was coming back 
anyway—I only went up to school maybe three days a week or two or three days a week 
depending on—so I did do some work in the office. I didn’t leave really for the whole two years, 
maybe I left for one semester. And then, you know things started coming back but that was 
definitely—I mean, Ian McHarg was there, another really inspiring person, I mean, just so

passionate and strong and funny—could tell great stories but so—they always had a point, I 
mean, it wasn’t funny. You know, he was really wonderful guy and by that time yeah, schools 
had changed. I mean it was much more equal in terms of the—more diverse the whole, kind of 
spread of people. It was interesting being—and I had to do everything on your own after being in 
an office where, you know, you have a lot of support and so that was also interesting and a good 
experience to have to do all that again. 
SF: 
And how about transitioning to CAD [Computer-Aided Design]? When did that occur in 
your office or was that before or after… 
BW: 
CAD—I learned to do ArcInfo, I guess it was called, at Penn [University of 
Pennsylvania] but CAD still wasn’t the dominant drawing medium then—I don’t remember 
exactly when we—but I basically never learned it—it was because at that point, you know, I 
mean you’re the principal and you’re not really doing any of the drawings any more like when 
Diane and I started. And if you don’t really use it a lot you’re not going to learn it. So I mean I 
did learn at Penn how to write programs. We used it more as a GIS [Geographic Information 
System] kind of like for sorting, for different criteria for siting things. So you’d write a program 
for the kind of sorting that you wanted, you know, for what you were looking for as an asset or a 
liability, whatever cancel out certain parts of the site. But no I never really learned CAD or how 
to use more than word processing basically (laughs). So I’m a bit of a Luddite. I don’t have a 
television. I like to use the little bit of free time that I have enjoying nature or quiet or, you know, 
just people, being with other people and talking, just having a good time.  I don’t really—I mean 
I enjoy you know every site, it’s not like I don’t watch it. I know the popular culture but I—and I 
enjoy it but I just don’t need to have it on all the time. So… 
SF: 
So how about balancing that work/life balance, with raising children and balancing 
architecture? 
BW: 
Well, that was hard. I mean I had, again I was fairly fortunate you know, that I have— 
was able to support myself and have some means and have good people that would work for me 
to take care of my kids after school. I had some neighbors, they went to a friend’s house some, 
you know, like every Tuesday or whatever and every Wednesday, they’d do something else, you 
know we sort of had a schedule. But yeah it was hard to just divide your time between—you 
know, Diane and I used to call it “wearing different hats” and I mean that would be with your 
children and family as well, as marketing verses design and all the different kinds of things you 
have to do and how at the beginning I probably wasn’t that good at switching gears. I would say 
now, I’m really good at it (laughs). You know, I can switch from design mode to 
[00:35:00] 
marketing mode, I mean I just know—cuz it takes a different way of thinking and at first it’s kind 
of hard—so yeah, you get better just like anything with practice. But yeah, I definitely remember 
it being hard and feeling torn, you know.

SF: 
I don’t know how many children you have but… 
BW: 
Two. 
SF: 
Two. Either one of them interested in architecture or landscape? 
BW: 
No, well I mean gardening. They both like gardening. One went into graphic design in 
college, Sarah, the oldest one, but then she ended up like starting a nonprofit. She’s much more 
service oriented. She basically—well she had a shop where she worked with artists to do 
products, that was another thing she did and then that didn’t work out—the recession I think kind 
of killed that at one point. And then—but she basically has a history of working for nonprofits. 
Now she’s working with a music nonprofit that teaches all kinds of people music and presents 
musical things and just really trained to make sure people have music in their life so that seems 
to be her thing. And then the other, the younger one, Lucy, is a—she got her degree as an 
economist with a second in dance, so a dancing economist. And then she’s still doing that. She is
—for a while to support herself she did tutoring to take the GRE [Graduate Record Exam]. And 
she did that for a lot of people here in New York. She’s in New York, the other one’s in Portland, 
Maine. They’re both married and then she decided to switch to real estate but she still does 
dancing, she had her own dance troupe for a while—now she’s more doing dance in theater so 
she—she was in—now I have a blank—“Angels in America” on Broadway—she was one of the 
shadows, she held up the left wing of the angel. So you know, she does stuff like that. She was in 
“Sleep No More”. She’s been in some pretty good things. So I’m very proud of both of them. 
They both have their own thing in life and yeah, that has nothing to do with architecture (laughs). 
But I think they may have learned perseverance (laughs). Cuz that’s one thing that really 
important. 
SF: 
Especially in architecture. 
BW: 
Well, even more in dance. She’s got it even worse than we do. So, yeah. 
SF: 
So, it’s so interesting reading your different projects and your constant reference to the 
interface between water and land. And for example, let’s see in—well in—at The Edge, you 
describe “at water’s edge the city grid and river’s ecosystem converge, mingle and clash blurring 
the boundaries,” and then the Pier at St. Petersburg—the interaction with the water, other 
projects—Tide Point “pulling the site into the community”, and then I was fascinated with St. 
Patrick’s Island. And so there seems to be this strong affinity, going back to perhaps what you 
talked about earlier with water and… 
BW: 
Yeah, I think so.  I think it’s also—I feel like where, you know, as urban—I mostly, I deal 
in urban places, but it’s where you can see nature the most and people are attracted to water so I 
think it’s a good place to try to introduce people to nature. And my goal really, especially in the 
early projects—but I think still, it’s to get people to look harder and try to understand what’s 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
14
going on—because I think especially, I as a kid was lucky enough I can walk down to the creek 
and I can play in it and I can move it around. Nobody was like—there were no railings or, you 
know, I mean, all kinds of—I can experiment basically all day long and see animals and it’s very 
hard for people to do that these days, although you can. So, so we try to make more places for 
people 
[00:40:00] 
to be able to interact and where you can’t actually interact—can’t actually go down and touch the 
water, that you at least—there’s something about the design that helps you, maybe makes you 
think a little bit or go, “Hmm, why is that like that?” so that, you know, you start wondering, just 
like if I see a fossil. Or so we sort of try to create evidence that may have been erased through the 
urbanization process to maybe, to provoke thought and hopefully, you know, also maybe people 
like to come back and, you know, think a little more—and different places you can be and see it 
in a different light some times of day and stuff like that. So it’s—most of our parks are not 
heavily programmed. You know, there’s kind of a trend these days for parks to have a lot of 
programming—different things going on in them. Ours are more about being there and just— 
SF: 
And that’s intentional? 
BW: 
Yeah,that’s intentional, yeah.  
SF: 
Was the access to the waterfront—was that something that drew you to New York when 
you were trying to decide where to open your new firm? 
SF: 
No, I think what drew me to New York was more a sense of community with more 
landscape architects and architects. I mean actually I tried and was successful. In Baltimore I 
helped start the center [Baltimore American Institute of Architects Chapter] or [Baltimore 
Architecture Foundation]. I was president of the chapter for a while but I think it was actually 
even before I was president that—cuz I had been to Philadelphia that had a strong center. I mean, 
again, back then we didn’t have the internet so having places with books and, you know, access 
to different kinds of materials and talking and lectures—all that was so much more important 
because you couldn’t just find everything like you can now on the internet. I think it’s important 
to remember that. So anyway, I think I was more interested in finding a place where, yeah, I felt 
a little more at home after the kind of experiences I had. And when I came to New York, it was 
wonderful. People are so open to new ideas, I felt very welcomed. I, you know, didn’t feel like a 
weirdo, that some kind of nerd weirdo or whatever (laughs). You know, not that that stopped me, 
like I said before but I just—I think that’s more what I was looking for. I mean, there’s water 
everywhere, you know, I didn’t need to go to New York for the water, yeah. 
SF: 
Well, that’s interesting.That most people probably wouldn’t say that they came to New 
York for community and…  
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
15
BW: 
Well, hmm… 
SF: 
I think probably. I don’t think people would…  
BW: 
Equate that.   
SF: 
Yes, and I think that’s really wonderful that that’s what you— 
BW: 
I definitely think—that’s what it was for me. 
SF: 
That’s what brought you here. Did you know a lot of people here before you came here?  
BW: 
No, not really. I mean there were some. You know, a lot of people from Cornell, of course 
this was ages ago, had come to New York but no, none of my—I didn’t have any good friends 
here. I mean there—so I had acquaintances and I will say that, yeah, some of those people were 
very helpful and very nice. I mean, I think in general coming to New York was a—was more like 
the Franz Vidor experience. You know, it was a great experience—people were nice and 
welcoming, and not what you—not what New York might have the reputation as. 
SF: 
So you hung out your shingle. Did you originally come to Brooklyn? 
BW: 
No actually—oh, our first office was actually in Brooklyn. Just by, well our very first 
office—I was still in Baltimore before I moved here—I had a desk in a friend’s office. They 
rented us a desk and I realized very quickly that that wasn’t going to work. That if I really 
wanted to have an office here, I had to be here—that coming up, even if it was once a week just 
wasn’t going to cut it so that’s—I mean, and I, at first, I said do you guys want to have a branch? 
I mean I wasn’t like I had to go off on my own. But they  
[00:45:00] 
weren’t interested, understandably and we had a fine business going where we were and they 
didn’t have the same desires as I did so that’s why I ended up just going off on my own. They 
were kind enough to—I took the Tide Point project up to New York with me and also strangely 
enough the Constellation project which is now under construction which is like the longest—
twenty years later (laughs), it’s finally happening. So those two projects were—especially Tide 
Point because I think Constellation was at that point was kind of in a stalled—but they said it’s 
your project, if anything ever happens to it, you can take it. So yeah, Tide Point was an active 
project and I just brought that up here and I started—me and Andrea—the other woman that had 
been with me in Baltimore and her boyfriend was up here so she wanted to move up here. So, so 
that was good. So it was the two of us and we—our first office was in Dumbo [Brooklyn, NY] 
which at that time you know, we were in a building that you had to come up in a freight elevator 
and it was mostly artists and warehousing still—a real loft building.  
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020

SF: 
So how did you go about marketing yourself in this new venture? 
BW: 
Oh, yes, so you know people, like I said, were very friendly. So some people hired—you 
know, you can market to architects—which we did. So we worked for other architects as their, 
you know, doing the landscape on their projects, and then we did go after—we were lucky 
enough even to win—it wasn’t the first one we went after but you start—for public projects it’s 
these RFP’s [Requests For Proposals]—so you just have to figure out how to start filling out all 
the forms. And of course at the beginning, the projects are ones you did someplace else so you 
know, but then once Tide Point got built that was a big help because—and that went pretty quick 
because it was a developer project so at least something was up pretty quickly so we had 
something to start showing in terms of waterfront. And Baltimore’s waterfront, you know, was 
sort of known as being early, good waterfront. And I think the Tide Point project showed off 
nicely. So anyway, we were able to get the West Harlem Piers project which started off as a plan 
for the forty block area all around up there. And then it went into implementation of the park 
itself so that was a great, you know, we were very lucky, a very great beginning to the firm. 
SGF: And so your firm’s evolved and now you’ve worked on many, many projects all over the 
world, so how many people do you have now and… 
BW: 
We have about ten, and we were up to eighteen at one point. And that was when—that 
was right before the crash in 2008 or whatever. That was—we also were doing a lot more 
architecture then. We were still doing sort of mill buildings in Providence, Rhode Island and 
things like that—housing. We’ve sort of backed away from the architecture in the sort of second
—as I rebuilt the firm again after that. And we still do it and we’re very proud of the Tampa 
building - The [Tampa] River Center, that we just did so, you know, but it’s more buildings in our 
parks. We don’t go out marketing, you know, architecture. 
SF: 
So that—that must give you an advantage too that you can—that you can do both. 
BW: 
I think that’s interesting, actually—I think it does. It’s hard to explain that to people and 
you would think that would be an advantage in marketing but I haven’t figured out how to do it, 
because people think of things as being in buckets. But I will say, like for instance, we took part 
in the competition for the St. Pete [Petersburg] pier before we got the project there. We were 
working in Tampa then on that project, that park and I put in a proposal to be one of the teams 
for the competition and we got selected as one of the teams—five teams competing. So they pay 
you to do a little scheme of how you’d do the project and I think because we were landscape 
architects—we entered as an architect because it was about 
[00:50:00]  
what are you going to do to this building. We have this building at the end of the pier. Are—you 
had to say if you were going to renovate it or build a new building—that was—they wanted to 
know right from the beginning.  So we said we’re going to renovate it. And then the budget was 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
17
very important to them. We had reviews as we were going along. And at a certain point, I just 
said, “If you really are serious about the budget like you say you are, you cannot afford this 
project. I’ve done a lot of pier buildings and it’s very expensive and if this is all the money you 
have, you cannot do a nice building and make anything else, like a nice way to get there, you 
know.” The building’s like way out a thousand feet and between, right now, all they have is 
parking lots and a horrible road. I mean, like why would anybody go out there? You know, you 
certainly would never walk. And so with my experience, I was saying you really want to create 
an attraction, you know. I mean that’s not a public thing—a restaurant at the end of a pier—I 
mean okay, so people can go up on the roof or something but what you want is an attraction. So I 
said don’t do a building, do a park and I made a big lagoon. I cut away a lot of the land and cuz 
all they had was, you know, parks that were lawn and trees—like very boring kind of parks that 
had no kind of diversity. You couldn’t tell what the ecology of the area was, I mean it just looked 
like anywhere else except the trees were a little more exotic. So we—our proposal totally broke 
the rules—and we didn’t have to worry as an architect that we would be giving away the project 
to somebody else. We were free to say what we thought it really should be. So yeah, so we made 
a beautiful lagoon. We put a little folly out at the end. We still built—you know, we built the pier, 
you know, put something out there that you could go to, and have fun and get a view and all that 
but—we put the building on the land, with a cafe, and all that, that was more in the middle so, 
you know, it was more centrally located. We got disqualified. But it was also wonderful because 
they have the sunshine laws so the whole deliberation of the jury was totally public in the public 
space, people were allowed to be there. We were watching it upstairs on TV. So they’re getting to 
the point where you can tell they’re like talking about us and how we didn’t provide that. And 
we’re going, “But we did, but we did.” But of course, they can’t hear us. We just didn’t provide 
their way—like our nature museum—well the whole thing was a nature museum, you know.  It 
didn’t fit their descriptions of how they wanted it and so they said, “Okay, we’re going to 
disqualify it.” And all of the sudden, the doors of the chamber—they were having it in the 
council chambers—broke open and this twenty-something comes running in and going, “You 
can’t, you can’t.” We have no idea who he is, you know, “You can’t do that. This is for our 
grandchildren, don’t disqualify….”  And I mean, we’re going, Who is this guy? This is 
wonderful, you know. Like you couldn’t have planned—I mean, it was totally amazing. Nothing 
like that has ever happened to me before, you know, that—they wrote songs about it. I mean, we 
had this whole fan club. It was totally amazing. So that was very inspiring that—and it was this 
whole fight between—sort of a power struggle really between the older people of town that had 
traditionally kind of been in charge. But St. Pete was attracting a lot of younger people—I mean 
good, because you know, otherwise… 
SF:  
Right, it has to go on. 
BW: 
Right, so anyway like I said, we did get disqualified. They didn’t listen to the—it was a 
fireman that came—yeah—but it was a wonderful thing that I’ll never forget in terms of, you 
know, people do understand what you’re trying to do and it had a real impact. I mean they were
—the whole community was just so involved in the whole project. I mean, and they still are, I 
mean it’s a very active—which you know that’s just so wonderful too—and I would say—I mean 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
18
and I love community involvement, I mean, because to me it’s really—and most places are pretty 
involved which is why I love to do public work. You’re doing stuff for them, I mean that’s why 
you’re there and, you know, you of course want to bring some ideas forward but if they don’t 
like them then, you know, then that’s the way it is. 
SF: 
Did they then participate in saying they wanted the  
[00:55:00] 
beach area, they wanted the docking for…  
BW: 
Well, uh, well there was already a beach there, I mean well what happened, so—so the 
pier—the people that won, won. And that project then sort of became cast in stone. Then we 
were later hired to—so the pier though it started not of the town—you know, there is sort of this 
piece of land where we were cutting the lagoon through actually—that has parking on it, that has 
a street on it and then the pier kind of goes out from there, way out. So—so suddenly the city 
realized that if they the pier that they hired the people that designed that. And then they had their 
nice downtown which has like rows of shops along the water. But that all the sudden they had 
nothing in between and that that was going to be a big problem because, you know, there’s this 
gap and who’s going to want to walk across it, right. So they put out another RFP and that’s what 
they hired us to do. So we became the connector piece and so this was fixed—this is fixed. And 
so we had to have another—a year process talking to people about what they wanted in between
— so that’s—that’s what we did. 
SF: 
Did you ever see that fireman again? 
BW: 
Yes, I asked him out for coffee. I was like who are you? I wanted to know. Yes, he’s since 
kind of gone off traveling and I still see his Instagram account and off to all these different places 
and stuff. But um, yeah, no it was, of course, I had to meet him (laughs). And so it was, you 
know—we really—I enjoy that kind of getting involved with what’s going on in the community 
and helping it change for the better, you know. I mean, I still look back now—that project’s 
almost finished and go, Gosh if they’d just done the lagoon—I mean how—how amazing would 
that have been? We have a stormwater pond—that’s not the same though. The lagoon was 
actually going to be tidal and really brackish. Yeah, this is freshwater and—which is good too. 
Birds—still making a more diverse place. And yeah, we moved stuff around, we got rid of the 
street. It’s much more pedestrian. We had a little fight with how many cars they need—with the 
city, you know, but at a certain point you just have to go on. So yeah, it’s going to be great. It’s 
going to open in May. 
SF: 
Now how about the big question of climate change and how you have to deal with that in 
terms of educating people and reflecting it in your projects. 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
19
SF: 
Right, well I think it’s really hard. I mean again, I just think the whole way—no matter 
how hard—I mean this is something I’ve been working on lately myself because it’s not just 
about doing the project. It’s about the maintenance also—like what happens as the project 
continues. And I think the—I mean there’s, there’s you know, there’s the things about the water 
but I’m talking about super big picture. Landscapes change, the climate’s changing—different 
trees, different, you know, all things are—things are going to change. If we make landscapes that 
are really gardens that aren’t allowed to change, in other words, that you don’t allow seeds to 
drop and other things to come in or, you know, we’re not—you know, we’re going to have to tear 
it out in fifty years and go okay, it’s climate change, we have to put in something else—or twenty 
years or you know, whatever.  I mean, so I’m thinking—my thoughts on that have evolved to the 
point where we need to let nature have a lot more agency—that we can’t do everything—we 
have to let things happen and it’s gonna mean that—  
SF: 
You have to let nature be nature. 
BW: 
Right, so that people don’t like the way that looks a lot of times, you know. It’s how do 
we manage that? How do we get people involved? How do people, you know—I think it gets 
back to that kind of wanting people to engage in the place and really understand it, not just think 
of it as the backdrop for their activities, you know, that it’s a shared place with all of the other 
animals and plants that live there. So I just don’t think—so there’s going to be—that’s a hard 
one. That’s what I’m working on right now. How do we—or our thinking about it—trying to 
really figure that out and so I’m going to be doing some speaking  
[01:00:00] 
things, the book that we’re putting out is called Dynamic Geographies. It’s looking back at our 
twenty years with sort of saying, Okay well this is a wonderful much-loved park but, you know, 
does it actually—it doesn’t ever change, you know. What, what—like what are we thinking, you 
know? How are we—so it’s being critical of what we’re doing as well and saying—I mean, it’s 
hard because of the way maintenance things are set up. You always meet with the maintenance 
people and this is what they do and so you have to change a lot of the thinking. It’s really a 
different way of thinking and then when you think that way then you can say, Okay well then, 
yes, let’s let that happen and we’ll let this change a little. I mean you can still have areas—what 
I’m thinking trying to put forward now—is that, you know, like management—it shouldn’t just 
be all one—even in a small park—you shouldn’t think of it as all being managed the same way. 
But you know, this particular piece of lawn for humans can be managed a certain way but the 
place right next to it that’s a planting bed should be managed totally differently, it’s not for 
humans. And I’ve done a lot of research into why people don’t like that and there’s, there’s—I 
guess there’s a feeling of safety. If something looks uncared for they also think it’s not safe. So 
how do we—flowers sort of mean that it’s cared for, you know, so maybe we have to make sure 
that there’s you know—that it’s not totally nature. We can still augment it and make it seem 
cared for but—but that it’s going to be a different aesthetic and that how do we get people to 
accept that? Because that’s really been hard—some of the projects we’ve been working on—
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
20
while the lagoon they hated—I mean people would say oh, well what are, you know, once in a 
while. It’s like they’re you know, afraid of— 
SF: 
Afraid of the wild. 
BW: 
Yeah once it comes in and then we don’t like it, you know, how do we get rid of it? 
SF: 
It’s the front lawn mentality of everything has to be… 
BW: 
Right, they just want to control it. I mean it’s very strong in all different kinds of places 
and, you know, we also worked so that was— St. Pete a certain kind of community. In Detroit it 
was a whole different kind of community. Again it was thought of as a scary thing and not kept, 
you know, like there because there’s so much people being abandoned—they didn’t like it also 
for that. And so, yeah, but I really just believe that if we don’t let trees start growing themselves, 
you know, then we’re going to be in big trouble. We need to let more things just grow. And more 
places—we need more, more trees. I keep looking around and go, Well why don’t we have trees 
there, you know? I mean, now, when you start thinking that way you can start seeing tons— 
SF: 
They’re helping us breathe. 
BW: 
Yes, they’re helping us breathe and you can start seeing lots of places where they could 
be if we really valued them, you know, and let them do their own thing. Cuz also you, I mean,  
have a beautiful stand of trees but if you don’t let any babies grow you’re not going to have trees 
in, you know, twenty more years there unless you plant little babies that start all over again. So I 
mean— 
SF: 
So when you, when you show a plan for a particular site do you show it—this is the way 
it will look now but then this is how it will look in twenty years if you let this happen? 
BW: 
Oh, we—we try. I mean again, yes, I mean, we do. In fact, in a funny way sometimes 
people ask—the client asks for that even—because also if you’re planting new things they want 
people to understand they’re not getting what you show in the rendering with the beautiful big 
trees. You’re going to actually get this and it will look like this, you know. So yeah, we do try to 
represent that but, you know, it’s still, I think it’s a challenge for everybody. I mean for landscape 
architects to really sort of re-conceptualize how we think about design—what design means if 
it’s not just a point in time—if it’s really a process kind of and we’re part of it and we 
collaborate, you know, with other forces that are around us. 
SF: 
So do you go back after your projects are constructed just to see how 
[01:05.00] 
people—just to sit and observe how people…?

BW: 
O yes, yeah, yeah and it’s really interesting. And to see how they’re maintained. I mean, 
sometimes I’m more happy with how the people are using them then how the maintenance is 
going. Sometimes you want to just do it yourself, you know. But yeah, like  we have—there was 
a period of—I would say really some bad maintenance at one of our parks and actually some 
volunteer trees actually came up, you know, which I was like, Wow, this is maybe kinda cool that 
this happened. But on the other hand all of the understory got trampled and so there’s a lot of bad 
things that happened too. And so you know, it’s a double edged sword. We had another project 
like our St. Patricks project which is all based on ecology and the water moving through and very 
discrete places for people, you know, carved out in that project and—but unfortunately you 
forget that—so the people that we designed it with left, before the project was even over, so 
they’re not in the organization any more and so just, you know, at the tail end of construction, 
new people came in, they just sort of see it finished—big opening—and, you know, and they’re 
great, it’s very successful but they didn’t really understand what the design was really based on. 
And I just came back because it was just in a magazine and I met the writer there and was 
walking around with him and all the sudden we see this cleared area that was right in the middle 
of a mature forest.   
SF: 
I read that article, yeah. 
BW: 
And I’m going,” Oh my God, what happened?” And you know, I suddenly realized that—
because these were great people, they’re trying to—you know, they did the park—they want 
everything to be wonderful but they just didn’t have the slightest idea and they thought, Oh, this 
is the easy way to get there because that had been a path. We were trying to let it grow. We had 
done all of this planting to—but they just plowed all this construction—and then had them 
smooth all the land out afterward which was, oh, my God, like the wrong, total wrong thing 
ecologically. So actually I’m just finishing up a maintenance plan that I’m sending them that 
explains all the ecology and… 
SF: 
Because at St. Patricks it’s designed to actually flood, as storms come in, it’s actually 
designed to flood and then… 
BW: 
Well, a lot of our parks are designed to flood. People are a little afraid of that too. Like 
oh, we can let the water come up?  It’s okay? “Like what are you doing about the flood?”  “Well, 
nothing, we’re just going to let it flood.” “What?” I mean, unless your park is supposed to 
provide flood protection which St. Patricks couldn’t—it’s an island in the river. I mean, you 
could—it had been divided from the water, the way it was before, it had been—the edge had 
been sort of fortified so that water didn’t come through it very often but so we opened up the 
edges and let the water come through more. But not every project has to provide flood 
protection, or can, you know, provide flood protection. Sometimes it’s better to just let them 
flood so, yeah. I mean and as long as you build them out of things—like don’t use a lot of 
styrofoam because it’ll start floating. Some people use a lot of styrofoam under paving and stuff
—bad idea.

SF: 
Learned from experience or watching good… 
BW: 
Luckily we didn’t do it but when [Hurricane] Sandy came there were a lot of parks that 
their paving all popped up because of the flood and went floating away. 
SF: 
Interesting. So where do you see yourself now in your career? 
BW: 
Well that’s what I’m trying now to decide. Actually, it’s kind of the next twenty years. 
I’ve been in these twenty year segments. But I think it’s about talking about what we were just 
talking about, trying to—I’m not sure how’s the best way to do that—but being more of a 
speaker, being a little more—I’m kind of a private person and have never, you know, even really 
promoted our firm that much really as long as we have enough work. I’m not out there caring if 
I’m well known or anything, no, but I think I’m more interested now in telling the story of 
people and how we need to live differently and design things differently. So I don’t know if that 
means, maybe I’ll try a little bit of teaching. I have taught from time to time in the past—or just 
try to speak more, you know. 
SF: 
Or writing—your first book Structuring Confluence… 
BW: 
Yeah, the second one will be coming out this fall. This is part of it up here, hanging  
[01:10:00] 
up.  Yeah, I’m actually—next week the graphic designer is going to have the first version of the 
whole book—next week, so which I’m sure will need lots of changes, you know. We give—we 
give them the text and pictures but they don’t use all the pictures. Did you pick the right ones? 
Are they in the right order? Is the right one big is the right one small, you know? So it’s a lot of
—the text doesn’t really change but how, you know, it gets put together. So that’s what we’re 
working on and yeah, then they’ll print it starting probably in June or something and then we’ll 
get it in early fall. 
SF: 
So this is—you’ve spent a lot of time on that as an education tool or more as a legacy for 
your firm or both? 
BW: 
Yeah, it was really for me, I think almost—because it was a thinking process—just sort of 
what you were asking about. And I mean it took me a year really to figure out what I wanted to 
write about, you know, like what am I, what’s important now, what should I be? So what, I’m 
looking back at twenty years, what did I learn, what are we doing, what—and so I started by 
looking through my projects and reflecting on them— sort of realize this thing about—that most 
of them are static, they’re not really dynamic like a real landscape and—I mean some of them are 
like St. Patricks Island, you know. Yeah, I guess there are small areas within it that are static and 
always going to look the same—playgrounds, you know—yeah, so that’s fine I mean, you know, 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
23
but the rest of it is changed, can be its own thing. So I started thinking about how—why couldn’t 
that happen in more places. I mean, that’s easier there because it’s in a floodway but why can’t 
birds just let seeds fall and they grow like they would normally anywhere. Why can’t—why can’t 
these things just happen like they would if we weren’t around? So anyway that’s what—so I 
started—yeah, it takes awhile when—then I finally made it into three essays. Yeah, starting with
—and still going through our projects—what I was explaining, why the early ones, the 
experience and the awareness and—so and then some things that are maybe more social. Social 
diversity is also biodiversity, is important. I mean, a lot of this is about biodiversity. You know, 
there is such a depletion of birds—I mean just everything, right. I mean we just have so much 
left, you know, and if we don’t just let it—you know we’re cutting out so many things, so but 
there’s, you know, we also need for other reasons our own of social diversity and then the 
biodiversity so I—those—and then the last one is more about dynamic systems and, you know, 
real, real wilding and making the—letting nature have agency and being part of the 
collaboration. 
SF: 
So what do you see as your legacy? 
BW: 
Ah, I don’t know.  I don’t know, I mean I don’t know—as you see, I’ve never really had a 
big plan. I just kind of go by… 
SF: 
But it’s worked. It’s nice that you’re open to new ideas and new adventures. 
BW: 
I think that I listen a lot. I’m pretty—I take a lot in so, you know, I think I’m trying to be 
aware of what’s going on and what might be a problem, what we’re not doing. So yeah, I hope I 
can help people, younger people, but I mean I’m involved in the Beverly Willis Architectural] 
Foundation. You know she was a—you should talk to her [Beverly Willis]. 
SF: 
Well, I know that they [Beverly Willis Architectural Foundation] did the movie and 
everything [on Beverly Willis].  All of this [project] will go to her foundation too.  But—I so but 
maybe, yes. Okay. 
BW: 
and the Design Trust [for Public Space]. I  think people get fixated like even this one I’m 
doing in June—the guy that was in charge, he’s like okay—so climate change—so what are we 
doing about rising seas? And I’m like, you know, it’s really just not about—even though I mostly 
do waterfronts, you know—it’s about trees and biodiversity and it’s not really just about rising 
waterfronts. I mean, you know, that’s—I mean that’s 
[01:15:00] 
important but it’s kind of not the big problem in a way. I mean it causes us a problem but it’s—
and you know, it will certainly change things but if we don’t let—it’s really the carbon and the—
you know, that’s causing the heat and getting rid of that and so anyway. So it’s just like putting 
the right frame around things. For a while, we were going to call my book “Reframing”. I had a 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
24
whole—went through a whole reframing. I wrote all—I mean, I basically threw all of that out in 
the end and started over with Dynamic Geographies. But yeah, I was thinking of calling it—you 
know, doing—it’s a… 
SF: 
Both of them—both titles are effective.  
BW: 
Yeah, you have to decide how to best put things forward. And yeah, I think it could have 
come out of that but for some reason it was hitting a dead end and I went another way. So but 
yeah, that was how I sort of started thinking more about reframing and it was just too hard to—I 
guess somehow it was easier to reflect on my—it was easier to tie together my work with it 
through the way I’m doing it now and make it into a better story. 
SF: 
Do you think it would be most effective educating architects or the general population or 
students? 
BW: 
I think all of the above. I mean you really—I mean I think even landscape architects. 
That’s what I guess I’m trying to say—here I am somebody who thinks they’re doing a good job 
and is dealing with climate change but we’re not. It’s just like we really have to go, you know, 
see it so differently to really make a change. So I’m going to hopefully start with our own 
profession and then, you know, of course I mean everybody. But I think we have to start with us. 
SF: 
Well you have such a passion for nature and it just comes through… 
BW: 
Yeah, no it’s sad, it really makes me, you know, I just go out and I think, Oh that poor 
tree. Doesn’t anybody know seeing. And then I go to my home town and they’re just dying— 
trees are dying everywhere. I mean if you really look, I mean it’s awful. I mean they’re just—uh
—so—I mean and that’s just a symptom and it’s one I can see, you know. There’s—I also, the 
things they talk about, about yeah, remember when your windshield was full of insects—like 
when I was a kid, you could barely see out of the, you know, because your car was constantly 
full of insects but now, never. I mean it’s never a problem. You know, just—so I mean the—but I 
have a pretty long time to reflect back on. But, I mean now you can see the big trees all flopped 
over. I mean, it’s not that hard so I would think people might wonder why that’s happening. I 
mean, yes, they’re old and maybe they have to die sometime but there’s an awful lot of dead ones 
right now—I mean now—so seems like a visible thing to talk about. 
SF: 
Well, are there any other projects or—that you’d like to talk about or stories you’d like to 
include? 
BW: 
Well, let me think. That’s hard always when you say that. I think we hit on most things. 
Nothing pops to mind. I mean I do want to—I probably haven’t said enough about all the help I 
get from everybody in the office. You know, these things are not something you can do on your 
own. I mean these are always all office projects and the kinds of things we do changes with who 
we have.  I think I said, the kind of projects we’re doing has kind of changed over time. We’ve 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020
Women Architects, afc2019/031
25
also gone away from Dubai and China and, you know, things that we did before the crash. We 
just—that was sort of a purposeful—we just stopped doing those kind of things now. Either 
they’re too far away—they’re not as—I mean they were interesting because the kind of scale you 
were working at but they were—you know they’re not as rewarding. You don’t get the 
interaction of people. It’s much more remote. 
SF: 
Well, 
[01:20:00] 
   
SF: 
So one more question—would you change—looking back on either the architecture or 
landscape architecture professions—is there anything you would want to change about them? 
BW: 
Well, besides from what I already talked about. I think architecture is—I mean they’re 
kind of—they’re doing some good stuff with the carbon neutral building, you know—I mean the 
way they’re thinking about things but it’s still—it’s very isolated. It’s all about their buildings.  
They’re kind of a little too—I would kind of would say, “Listen you guys, you know…” (laughs) 
SF: 
You mean more focused on the LEED [Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design] 
rating and… 
BW: 
Yeah, well and which is all really good. I mean like within the building we’re making 
how are we—well I guess they’re looking at systems and that they’re seeing where the materials 
come from more. I mean they’re looking more at the [supply] chains that way but they’re still 
very object focused. So I would like it if they would see things—or I think—or maybe they’re 
not the right profession. Maybe that’s fine. But I think there has—maybe it’s urban design has to 
come back or something so that there’s more of a besides—or landscape architects could just 
take over that kind of bigger picture thinking, you know. But I think for a while it was being 
done more by architects. I don’t think that’s what they’re—they’re doing some big picture 
thinking but it’s—but it’s still very much about their buildings as opposed to about how we, you 
know—how we live in a bigger way. So, I think that’s I guess… 
SF: 
As to what landscape architects can provide them? 
BW: 
Yeah, I think the relationship between the two is still—kind of very different. They’re 
both talking at very different things, maybe it’s even gotten more different, if anything, you 
know, which is sort of odd I feel like because, as somebody whose studied both of them, there 
are so many relationships. I don’t know. So I haven’t thought a lot about that but since you 
asked. 
SF: 
So let’s talk about—you’ve received two great honors, well deserved, from a lot of hard 
work with being elected as a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects first and then a 
Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects. 
Barbara Ellen Wilks, FAIA, FASLA Interview, March 10, 2020

BW: 
It’s quite an honor. I’m very honored by both. So the first one was while I was in 
Baltimore and Harold Adams from RTKL was the one who sponsored me. I had been at that 
point—maybe I was just becoming the president of our local chapter. And, but I remember going 
down there—I had a small baby at the time—and so I flew down—maybe it was the way back—
flew down and back with Harold and on the way back he had to hold her because I somehow—
which never happens to me—but got airsick. It was like the only time in my whole life but he 
was just so, so sweet and nice and patient about that. But yeah, no it was—it felt—I think there 
were several mentors in Baltimore that were very nice to me, men, you know, who I’m trying to 
remember now—it was the one who was president right before me. His name was Mark 
something—I’m not very good at names, I can picture him exactly and he’s the one who 
nominated me to be president because I’d been on a lot of the committees. And Harold Adams 
for some reason. Again, I never worked at RTKL, but he was nice for some reason and then 
Marty Milspaugh, somebody—he always was trying to get me involved in ULI [Urban Land 
Institute] and I said Marty—he was alway trying to get me to speak but I was a little afraid of 
doing that so I always kind of backed away from that. But those three people and many others 
were very, very helpful and I guess were as close as I got to having mentors in Baltimore. Then 
the ASLA—how did that happen? 
[01:25:00]  
I don’t remember who. Well, Mark Johnson was the one that—I think he was also one the also 
the people that write a recommendation but I don’t remember how I got sponsored originally 
here—here in New York. Maybe because I came later. But I do remember—I think because I 
started as an architect it took me a long time going to landscape architecture things to actually 
feel like I was part of that community, not because of anything on their part, they were always 
very nice. But I think you know, you grow up with people and you—when I went back to 
landscape school I was older and so people in your generation don’t remember you from school 
in landscape because you weren’t around. So it’s just a little bit of a mismatch at first but I think 
now, I’ve overcome that. I still feel part of the architects. They’re still—they still accept me—so 
I feel very honored yes to be on both of their Fellow’s list. 
SF: 
And for both of those you had to prepare an extensive background on your projects, your 
speaking engagements… 
BW: 
Yes, yes, which I still have. I still keep it updated because once you do that, you’ve got 
this huge list and so I just, every time I do something I add it to it so that I now will alway have 
that. But yeah, no again, many people helped me do that too. I mean, none of these things take—
all of these things in architecture and landscape architecture are so complicated. And it’s like 
hardly anything you do on your own, so I’m very thankful to all the people that helped me. 
SF: 
But what an accomplishment—in both architecture and landscape architecture. There 
probably aren’t too many people who have…

BW: 
I just got a email from Susanna Drake. And she says she’s joining the club. She just 
became—she was a Landscape Fellow first and now she’s becoming an Architecture Fellow.  So 
she did it in the reverse order so she said we need to go have a celebratory drink and find 
anybody else that’s in the club. 
SF: 
Well that’s a nice club to be a member… 
BW: 
There are a few.  
SF: 
Thank you. Thank you so much for sharing your journey and… 
BW: 
Yes, I can’t wait to hear other people that you talk to. Yeah, it’ll be really fascinating.
