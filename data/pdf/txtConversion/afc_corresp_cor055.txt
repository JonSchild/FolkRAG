Dear Doctor Spivacke:
I feel sure that we can complete work on the folksongs of Florida before August 1. At that
time do you wish us to send the machine to you or to North Carolina?
Thank you again for your kindness.
Sincerely yours, Carita Corse Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor WPA Writers'
