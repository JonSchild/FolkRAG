Julie Stockinger Interview Index 
 
00:00:01 Ruth Olson interviewing Julie Stockinger on July 10, 2014 in Lake Mills, Wisconsin. 
Julie is Swiss and German. Her father’s parents came from Switzerland; her mother’s parents 
were born in U.S. but were both German. They adjusted their name to Stack, a shorter version of 
their original name. Julie grew up in Delafield, in the country. She took a bus every day for 45 
minutes to attend a Catholic school; almost all the teachers there were nuns. The priest was in the 
school every day and had mass in Latin. All the nuns in that school, k-8, stressed vocation, a 
word Julie feels isn’t mentioned much anymore. Vocation in the sense of “why are you on the 
planet.” As a young person, Julie was already thinking about her purpose in life because of the 
nuns’ influence. From early on, she wanted to become a teacher; she was teaching her dolls at 
age 6. She started college at Stevens Point with a scholarship from Homemakers of America. All 
through high school she focused on fine arts and home economics. She grew up with a mother 
who sewed and cooked, so she could do that too. She won the scholarship because of her sewing; 
she was going to go to Stout (University of Wisconsin-Menominee) but it was too far away. She 
started in the Home Economics program at Stevens Point but hated it, so switched to Fine Arts. 
After taking all the courses she wanted to there, she transferred to UW-Milwaukee. 
 
00:05:30 At UW-Milwaukee was in Fine Arts and Art Education programs. She and five other 
students realized they wanted more, so they wrote their own program for being Art Therapists. 
They observed Charlie Johnson, one of the original art therapists in the area, in the 1970s. They 
graduated with 35 extra credits, like a double major, with courses in sociology, psychology, 
anthropology. Did lots of fieldwork on their own. When Julie graduated, she was asked to work 
at the Milwaukee Art Museum; that was her first job, teaching 5 and 6 year olds.  It was an 
amazing staff, they only hired working artists, so Julie felt quite honored. Julie finished her 
degree in December of 1976, and started work in January. At the museum, she taught art on 
Saturdays. During the week, she was on the list for subbing for five different school districts, for 
anything they needed, to see if this was what she wanted to do. She loved every placement she 
had. Many of the placements were outside of art—history, physical education, etc. She subbed 
until April, hoping for a long-term sub position. A long-term sub position for an elementary art 
teacher became available in the Elmbrook district, after Easter of that year, so Julie taught there 
until the end of the year.  
 
00:10:15 In elementary school, you see your students once a week, and you might have 28 
classes, from kindergarten to 6th grade, with 3 or 4 sections of each grade. So there were a lot of 
students to meet. At the end of the year, the teacher she was subbing for decided not to come 
back, so Julie applied for the position and got it. In fall of 1977 she had that art position full time. 
She had a beautiful classroom and didn’t have to travel. But she didn’t have seniority, so every 
year there was shuffling; every year for the next three years she was potentially laid off; she 
would get her pink slip in February or March and have to search for other jobs. That was actually 
a good thing, because it taught her not to take anything for granted, and to keep growing and 
learning. She came back every fall, but always at less percentage, because of declining 
enrollment. The Human Resources people at Elmbrook district would come to her in person to 
apologize. Her position went from 100% to 68% to 42% to 22%. As a young person, she needed 
to work, so she picked up jobs at boutiques and waitressed and subbed on days when she could.

00:15:20 During this time, Fairview North, her original school, closed due to declining 
enrollment and they redistricted the students. So Julie was at a different school but at only 22%. 
She started looking around and decided to revisit art therapy, and her love of reading. She broke 
her contract of 22%; she had to pay $200 to break her contract. She took a post at Waukesha, at 
Butler Middle School at 68% because she suspected she would like middle school. She 
discovered she really liked teaching 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students. She taught there one year; 
there were three other amazing art teachers there and she loved being part of a team. In 
elementary school, you are alone; you are the department and do it all. In secondary education, 
hopefully you get to be part of a team. After that year, she began attending Mount Mary College 
in Milwaukee, to focus on art therapy. She also got her 316 license, which is reading teacher 
(316 is the number of the license). She attended Cardinal Stritch College in Milwaukee and got 
licenses for elementary and secondary reading. She thought having the reading license would 
make her more marketable if she returned to public school. 
 
00:20:30 She got a position in art therapy at Lad Lake Incorporated, which was a residential 
treatment center for emotionally disturbed adolescent boys. She got chosen because she had her 
reading licenses; they justified the art therapy position by connecting it with reading. So Julie 
was the perfect person for the position; it was her philosophy to work with reading and art. Her 
studies for art therapy were not complete, but she was ready to accumulate her 1000 hours, and 
she could actually be paid in the process. To be a registered art therapist in Wisconsin, you have 
to complete 1000 hours of on-task contact time with clients. It’s hard to find a placement that 
will allow you to work a few hours a day with clients. But because Lad Lake had a component 
called Lakewood School, it fit in. Julie had a regular high school class with her clients. The 
classes were small, like an alternative high school on site. While she was there she had four 
student teachers from Mount Mary. She was still taking classes from Mount Mary, was 
connected to them a long time because she was working during the day and had to attend 
weekend workshops, which was exhausting, to get her Masters in art therapy.   She was at Lad 
Lake for five years, until 1988. During that time, she had her son in January of 1987, so stayed 
out of work until 1988. 
 
00:25:10 She was doing three things: a full time job, motherhood, and studying at Mount 
Mary—and was married. Teaching is all encompassing—you’re always problem solving and 
always thinking of it.  On March 11,1988, 4 p.m., Julie was attacked at Lad Lake, in her 
classroom. She was in therapy for a while, trying to go back. She couldn’t pull it together, and 
found she couldn’t go back. She was back at home with her child. They had an article in the 
paper about the attack, and someone from the Elmbrook school district saw it [crying]. Elmbrook 
was re-opening a school, and they called Julie to help with the re-opening, be part of a dream 
team. This meant re-districting and bringing students from elsewhere in the district to another 
building. So they asked teachers from all over the district who loved change, interviewed them 
and teamed them up. They had a hard-working principal, Karla Sloan, whom Julie still loves. If 
Karla thought the teacher could help meld families together—because the families were 
displeased about being uprooted from their neighborhood schools to the new school—she would 
hire her. Julie interviewed and took the job because she couldn’t pass it up. 
 
00:30:35 She was happy they recognized her skills and wanted her to be part of the start-up of 
Dixon Elementary School. Every teacher there was amazing; some were from her former school.

She worked there from 1988 to 1997. [phone rings; recorder paused]. The HR person who called 
her was the principal from her first school; back then, people really cared. Not like now. In 1997, 
the Elmbrook district decided they had an overflow of middle school students, so they re-
districted and yanked 6th graders out of elementary school and put them into two middle schools. 
They were sending the 9th graders into high school, bringing the 6th graders into middle school, 
and opening a new middle school. So, Julie had the opportunity to go to a middle school to teach. 
Seven teachers and staff from Dixon went to the middle school together. The philosophy at that 
time was that the middle school experience should be a time for experimentation for students, 
where they shouldn’t have to make big choices like in high school. In middle school the students 
change every year, and so need to have lots of experiences. They had a required wheel of 
electives.  
 
00:36:15 As middle school staff, the teachers were elective staff.  It surprised Julie that required 
electives were controversial for some. All 8th graders had to take at least one art class; there were 
some tough students because not everyone wanted to be there, but it was good to have a diverse 
class that included boys. 6th, 7th and 8th grades had to take art. Soon after Julie got there, it was 
decided that the students should have choices—it was a budgetary matter; they wouldn’t have to 
have as many teachers if students chose certain classes. So right away, Julie lost her department. 
Art was pitted against foreign language; if you took French, you couldn’t take Art because they 
were scheduled at the same time. Scheduling problems in middle school are astronomical if 
budget cuts are on the rise. So since then, they have been struggling. Art is required kindergarten 
through 6th grade, so students who aren’t artistically inclined stop taking art after 6th grade so that 
they can experience other things. Two years ago, Julie asked the principal to look at the students 
who signed up for Latin and who signed up for Art and not schedule them against each other, 
because those are the same people. He discovered that was true. It reminded him that artists are 
thinkers. These are good students, who need their art time; they are not looking for a free ride. 
 
00:41:10 Julie is still at this school since 1997-9: Pilgrim Park Middle School. Julie has seen 
drastic changes in staffing. Three years ago, there wasn’t enough work for Julie to be full time. 
The district decided they needed someone to teach elementary art; Julie tried not to be negative 
about traveling, but it was horrendous. The middle school schedule is that the students meet 
every day at a certain hour. In elementary school, the students meet once a week. Because of 
that, she couldn’t just go to an elementary school on one day. Her middle school students met 
every day until 1:30. The elementary school goes until 4, but middle school starts at 7:15, so 
Julie had to drop whatever she was doing at 1:40 every day and drive to another school to teach 
kindergarten at 2:00. She was always late; when she got to the room it wouldn’t be ready for her 
to teach; it was awful. So the next year, she decided to just go with 80% at the middle school. 
Julie doesn’t think most people would teach middle school students, but she was happy to be 
there. She switched to 80% but she is still there 100%; she just earns less. 
 
00:45:25 Because of the attack at Lad Lake, Julie couldn’t complete her Master’s degree. She 
was up to the point of the thesis, but couldn’t do it. In her mind, she knows she has a “spiritual” 
Masters, just not the piece of paper. She has had a Life License the whole time she has taught; 
she would not have had to take more classes, but she always continued to get education. For 
three years she went to Gatlinburg to the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts to learn fiber arts. 
A few years ago she started a Masters program at Carroll College. She does a lot of learning.

00:48:05 A typical day at work: students arrive at 7. Their day starts at 7:18. First hour is a core 
class. Julie’s day starts at 2nd hour, with a studio art class for 8th graders.  An “hour” is about 56 
minutes, when the bell rings. Julie never watches the clock; she designates a student to do that. 
3rd hour is another group of 8th graders. People who are 100% would then have another class, but 
because Julie is 80% she doesn’t. She is a forensics coach and judge. After 3rd hour, it is lunch 
for 6th, 7th and 8th graders, and so that is when she does forensics coaching. Students come in for 
a working lunch; and while they are practicing, art students can come in to work on their projects 
and listen to forensics. Julie has her own huge classroom. Students have to sign up to be there at 
that time; at any given time there are about ten or twelve. She also allows them to bring friends if 
they are not disruptive; she is always trying to recruit for forensics. 4th hour is 6th graders’ lunch, 
and that is when they come in for a working lunch; that is 32 minutes. Then there is a break for 
about half an hour; then 7th grade lunch starts. Julie eats during the break so that she can be there 
for the 7th grade working lunch. That is what works best for students; they aren’t good at staying 
after school anymore; their parents might have other plans for them. Julie likes to offer things 
during the school day so they can feel they are part of the school. Right after 7th grade lunch, 32 
minutes, there is 8th grad lunch, also 32 minutes. After that is STP—Student Teacher 
Preparation. Julie has a random group of 7th graders, not necessarily art students, who report to 
her room for a study period. They might ask to go to another room, to work with a math teacher, 
or stay with her and read a book, or do homework. She likes STP, but there is a problem; 
someone decided a few years ago that everyone should share the load of the core teachers by 
having a group of randomly assigned students. Julie’s problem is that as well as teaching 6th, 7th, 
and 8th grade art, she has this group of 18-22 7th graders, and she might have 30 extra students 
coming in to do make-up work who might need instruction from her, so she is exhausted because 
her room is packed during STP. 
 
00:55:40 She has seating for more than 50 students. Her room is divided into two areas—the 
studio portion which is three pods each with four 6’ tables, and on the other side is a huge bloc of 
tables making up her demo area. So, during STP, the random students sit in the studio area and 
the art students sit at the demo tables—one corner might be for paper mache, another corner for 
clay, drawing students in the middle. Julie has two Mac stand-alone computers, one PC, and two 
Mac laptops. She has an Elmo, a document camera which can record her demos so that students 
can see them later. She also uses the Elmo in real time so that students can watch her do 
something, which is projected via LCD projector on a screen. That way, she can draw in real 
time, and it both projects and records so that students can also watch it later. With the type of 
learners coming down the pike, even if they see a demo in person, it is always helpful to see it 
again. It’s nice when partners watch the demo because then they talk about it. Julie might also 
prepare questions for them to think about while they are watching. Right after STP, Julie has two 
6th grade classes back to back, for 6th and 7th hours. School ends at 2:31. The 6th grade art classes 
are required; art is required k-6, just as music is required k-6.   
 
01:00:45 Julie is the only art teacher, although there is a person who comes in for a semester. 
There are 10 sections of 6th grade art, and Julie can only physically teach 8, because they are a 
quarter long and two hours of her time. The other teacher comes to do the other 2 sections plus 
she has historically taught the special needs students. But they are going to stop doing that and 
mainstream those students without their aides into existing classes. Julie is worried about the 
effect this will have on the other students, since she won’t be able to give them as much 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

attention. She is seriously changing up the procedures in her class for demos, to make the class 
more student-directed. The aides aren’t with the special needs students during art because that is 
their time off. They have to be with the special needs students in core classes, but for some 
reason, the aides have a different schedule from the teachers; their day ends earlier. So if there is 
a 7th hour special needs student, there is no aide for that student. They want the aides there early 
in the morning to assist students into the building, or in case parents drop the students off half an 
hour before school starts. Julie just has to do the best she can. Her intensity has dulled; she used 
to be a force to be reckoned with but now she knows better and is more calm about everything. 
 
01:05:20 Julie tries to eat her lunch with someone else, but all the middle school teachers are like 
her and are eating their lunches with students. Or the teachers might be part of a team, so might 
either have lunch duty or eat with their team. So it’s hard to have a decent relationship with any 
other teacher in the school—you’ll never be eating lunch with them. Her friends now are the 
other forensics coaches; they’re all language arts teachers. It is fun and she is honored to be with 
them, at meets and practices. She learns a lot from them and they treat her as an academic 
person, the same as them. She has coached forensics since 1997. There are five forensics 
coaches. Julie doesn’t do things outside of school with other teachers; she might do an organized 
run or walk with them because she likes that. When she is not at school, she really needs to pay 
attention to her family. “If you are planning to stay married, you really have to pay attention to 
your husband.” Her husband doesn’t really want to hang out with the people she works with. For 
a while they would meet with the library aide and a teacher for dinner, but that fizzled out. Julie 
and her husband play Sheepshead, so they have that group of friends. Julie has a group of women 
she hangs out with in Waukesha, from all walks of life, but she doesn’t necessarily want to hang 
out with teachers because she doesn’t want to talk shop. 
 
01:10:00 Julie leaves school around 6. Julie is the budget manager for art. She always makes sure 
that student art is everywhere it could be. Part of what she might do after school is to talk with 
the principal or office staff about the cover for the assignment notebook, which is all student-
generated art. [Julie shows some examples of different covers for Ruth to photograph]. Julie was 
in charge of the yearbook for many years and shows an example of one year when she staged a 
Happening—her art students each created a puzzle piece after the artist Frank Stella and then 
they went in the gym and held the pieces over their heads to be photographed. She loved getting 
them so involved in that cover. When she first started doing the yearbook, it was all cut and 
paste, and she pushed them to be current, to be digital. But the cover was always special. Their 
mascot is the Panther, and so one year for a health theme all the Panthers on the cover were 
doing yoga.  
 
01:15:20 The year they transferred Julie to traveling to elementary, someone else did the 
yearbook; Julie couldn’t do it because she wasn’t there. That person now won’t give it up, and 
doesn’t allow the students to do the cover. Julie still does the assignment notebook, and always 
sticks her nose out to find anywhere where student artwork is needed. Julie involves her students 
in work in the community. You can’t be involved in community unless you start with yourself 
and move out. Middle school students are so self-centered anyway, Julie starts with the 6th 
graders themselves, asks them to speak about their yards, what they look like. For those in 
apartments, she asks them to describe what kind of trees are around the building. They make a 
Green Man mask, a face surrounded by foliage, with leaves from a tree that is in their yard, or 
Wisconsin Classroom Teachers 
 afc2013/017

from a tree that means something to someone in the family. They make the leaves in clay. That is 
one way she tries to have them connect to their surroundings. When Julie first asks them about 
trees, they don’t always know about trees, so she has posters of Wisconsin trees [shows an 
example of a plan for the mask]. So the starting point is look at their surroundings; next Julie 
talks about public art. Many haven’t heard of this notion. Julie has a big archive of public art 
from all over the world and asks them what they have seen; all of a sudden, they realize they’ve 
seen Picasso’s horse in Chicago, or Cloudgate (which they call “the bean”). Then they talk about 
the immediate community and public art. Often Julie will talk about this on a Friday, and they’ll 
come back on a Monday and talk about what they saw; they start to have an awareness of their 
physical surroundings. That’s the root of being community-minded; you walk past a house and 
see it every day—what kind of architecture do you think it is? All of a sudden, they realize “we 
have that.” She does that with 6th graders; they need to realize that they need to look around their 
world. 
 
01:21:00 When they get into 7th grade they always have a service project. Usually, it has to do 
with Empty Bowls, so someone from the food pantry comes in to talk about hunger in Waukesha 
County. The students are shocked to hear about local hunger, so they want to help; they make 
artwork (bowls) that can be sold to support the food pantries. Julie is on the board for ACAP—
Adaptive Community Approach Program—an agency that provides opportunities that are age 
appropriate and respectful to people with disabilities. They have a place called Art Links in 
downtown Waukesha, and a daycare facility in a church. Julie ran a bowl sale as a fund raiser for 
ACAP during “Friday Night Live” an event in Waukesha. The 8th graders do a beautification 
project [Julie shows an image]; they changed the way the ceiling tiles and stools look in a school 
space. Julie would like to see them take the idea of beautification to a nursing home or 
someplace else. The problem is time and transporting the students somewhere. So this year, she 
plans to bring community people in. The school already does work with local veterans; the 
students interview them. There are so many school initiatives that are community-based that 
Julie has to be careful not to duplicate or take kids too far away from their creation process, 
because there isn’t enough time. 
 
01:26:30 One of the things that makes Julie proud of herself is that she never stops learning. 
When Julie is on her way to school, there is never a day that she isn’t revved up to teach. She 
loves to get the kids excited about something that is current or local. She is proud that she stays 
connected with the world and isn’t so focused on one curriculum that she can’t deviate or 
change. She hopes that her students learn that there are many joys in every day and they have to 
stay open to them. Julie brought a geode in to show me. In 1996, Julie traveled to Italy with 
another teacher where they visited preschools that were completely art-based, with a focus on 
nature and light.  Since then, Julie has a lot of natural objects in her classroom, many 
manipulatives. For a long time, she had a heart-shaped rock that a friend had found in Alaska. It 
had a hole in it, nature-driven and not drilled. Julie put it on her lanyard with her keys. She often 
loans her lanyard to students to go get supplies. She lent her lanyard to Albert, a student, who 
played with the lanyard and broke the heart-shaped rock. He felt bad; he knew it was special. 
Julie didn’t yell at him, but let him know that she was upset; she feels it’s important to be honest. 
That same day he wrote her an apology and gave her his geode. This is an 8th grade boy. Julie 
feels she has to keep the apology and the geode together, and will always remember that he cared

to do that. It’s part of teachers’ jobs to put kids in touch with being human, with caring, about 
everything, as much as they can.  Julie and Albert both cried when he gave her that.  
 
01:34:15 End of interview.
