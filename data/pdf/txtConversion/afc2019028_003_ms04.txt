cousin down here.

ALC: Right, were there any clubs or regular gatherings for farmers?
HA: No.
ALC: No.
HA: Only time of gathering up we had around here was when somebody got crippled up
[unintelligible] they’d go in and help with the harvest.
ALC: So if somebody got hurt or crippled up everybody would gather to help ‘em harvest.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Wow, was that a family thing or was it just the whole community.

LC: I heard I didn’t know because I heard one time their house burned.
HA: Yeah.
LC: And they moved into the chicken house and lived in a chicken house till they got another
house going. Till he got the house fixed up…

GC: My mother told me that the Klan did fourth of July parades [unintelligible]  country which I
think she meant like Birds [presumed spelling] but she said that people of all, all people white
people and Black people would come out and watch the parade. Which seems like a weird.

went to high school down there. Had [unintelligible] pool room on the northside square, we
could play pool on the back table, we could walk up get us a hotdog or whatever you want to eat.
Go back there eat the hotdog and play pool. And they had a half-a-dozen tables in there.
12
GC: I remember the pool hall we had to walk across the street, we couldn’t walk in front of it
because my grandmother said that bad people hung out at the pool house [laughter]
HA: Still trying to think of that what his name was, I can’t think of it.
ALC: I have one more question, cause this is just something I’m thinking about, my great aunt
farmed land out in Iowa.
HA: Uh-huh.
ALC: And on Sundays, they had particular traditions. Lunchtime you’d have, on Sundays you’d
have a big meal, and in the evenings you wouldn’t eat quite as much. When you’d go over to
your grandparents across the road, what would you eat on Sunday? How would you do it?
HA: [laughs] Uh, well what sticks out in my mind we ate at the same time they did, ate the same
thing they did, and before we’d go to bed he’d give us a bowl of Post Toasties.
ALC: You’d get a...
HA: He’d have a bowl, that’s what he’d eat, a bowl of Post Toasties before he went to bed.
ALC: A bowl of Post Toasties before he went to bed.
HA: And we had, we had a bowl too.
ALC: You’d have a bowl too before you went to bed.
HA: Yeah before we went to bed.
ALC: In the evening!
HA: That’s when we stayed with him.
ALC: Just when you stayed with your grandpa.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Okay, okay, did you ever have popcorn?
HA: Yeah we had popcorn but it don’t stick in my mind cause I remember [unintelligible] the
popcorn.
ALC: Would you pop it over the fire?
HA: No over the stove.
13
ALC: Mmm-hmm, over the stove.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Over the stove, over the stove. And on Sunday’s what would you have for your big Sunday
dinner? What would you usually eat?
HA: Sometimes you’d have chicken.
ALC: You’d have chicken.
HA: Fried chicken.
ALC: Fried chicken.
HA: With pies and cakes.
ALC: What kind of pies?
HA: Cherry pie, they raised cherries, they had two or three cherry trees.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, and what kind of cake? Did you have a favorite?
HA: No I didn't have a favorite. But mom used to make a cake, mom used to make a cake. It had
either white on the bottom or brown one, she had three kind of, three layers.
ALC: Three layer cake!
HA: Three layer that was all different color.
ALC: Wow and different flavors?
HA: Well all had the same taste, same taste to me.
ALC: Okay, okay [laughter] just three different colors.
HA: Just three different colors but it was pretty you know, had pink icing on it.
ALC: Mmm-mmm.
HA: Or chocolate so...
ALC: Would you make uh, would you make ice cream?
HA: Yeah.
14
ALC: And you’d do that with the hand crank?
HA: Do it with the hand crank.
ALC: Did you just do vanilla or...
HA: Over at grandma’s was when we’d done that too…
ALC: You’d do that over at grandma’s, now where did you get the ice did they have an icehouse?
HA: You had to go down to Pinkstaff, they   had an icehouse down there.
ALC: Oh you’d have to go to Pinkstaff to get the ice, okay, alright.
HA: Yeah turn it by hand.
ALC: Yup, did you have favorite flavor?
HA: Just ice cream, vanilla is all I know.
ALC: Vanilla, that was it? That was it. Now I know that a lot of people when they think
African-American farmers they think things like kind of southern style cooking, collard greens,
okra, did you ever have any of that?
HA: No.
ALC: No.
HA: No, I’ve had okra but I don’t really like it, yeah.
[20:00] ALC: Mmm-mmm, so what was the traditional vegetables you’d have with your chicken,
your fried chicken? What were the sides you’d have?
HA: Well actually I liked the dark pieces of chicken I didn’t like the white ‘cause it was dry.
ALC: Mmm you didn’t like that.
HA: Just the way I get meals on wheels here now. They don’t come around unless they give me
brown chicken,
ALC: But when you were...
HA: black eyes of peas [unintelligible] [ laughter] Now when I call down there I say
[unintelligible] [laughter].
15
ALC: Now when you were a kid, and you told me you didn’t like peas and you didn’t like to
grow peas in your garden, but when you were a kid if you had your Sunday dinner what was out
on the table you’d have your chicken.
HA: Chicken.
ALC: And then potatoes.
HA: Gravy.
ALC: Gravy, and potatoes?
HA: [unintelligible] have gravy, yeah and the taters.
ALC: Taters what else?
HA: Green beans.
ALC: Green beans Mmm-mmm.
HA: Some pie you  have to put the pie in there, somewheres
ALC: Mmm-hmm, any other side dishes? Jackie was telling me sometimes there’d be sort of a
tomato salad with onions.

HA: Not in the Spring of the year but got uh, you know after it was canned we open up in the
Winter [unintelligible] in the Summer.
JA: Wasn’t that stuff she used to put in the crock, or no that was when we were kids.
16
HA: Yeah, them seven-day pickles?
JA: She’d put in a crock and cook put the lid on and salt and whatever.
HA: Yeah, I think seven-day pickles...
ALC: Seven-day pickles.
HA: Yeah or something, it’s some days in there I don’t know maybe it’s more days than that.
ALC: And you put it in a crock.
HA:  She changed it, changed it you know every month. Change the thing of vinegar
[unintelligible].
ALC: And would you grow the pickles, cucumbers in your garden?
HA: yeah, yep.
ALC: Yep, yep, did you ever grow carrots?
HA: Yeah I never did care for carrots, and still don’t care for ‘em [laughter]. Yeah, but you know
[unintelligible] they’d throw in, they’d throw in carrots, carrots in the I guess hot water throw
‘em right back out, and then they cook when they get here, they’re warm.
ALC: Yeah, so here’s my last question. What the question I haven’t asked that I should’ve asked?
About farming, about being African-American farmer, uh in Illinois, any of that, what have I
missed?
HA: [You haven’t asked me] Have you enjoyed being a Black person?
ALC: Hmm, I’m going ask you that then:  Have you enjoyed being a Black person?
HA: Yes.
ALC: Yes.
HA: ‘Cause I’ve, I’ve never run into any you know...
ALC: You’ve never run into what?
HA: I never run into any, you know discrimination around here.
ALC: Okay.
HA: But I’ve been to sales and stuff and I’ve heard them talk about me.
17
ALC: Uh-huh, like what?
HA: Well, I imagine just like they talking ‘bout them three uh girls on the television, the
President got [unintelligible]. I go to Salem and they be talking about ‘em. [Harry Anderson is
referring here to President Trump’s slurs against three junior female Democratic politicians
including New York’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]
ALC: That’s how they would talk about you where you came from?
HA: Mmm. [Affirmative]
ALC: Mmm-hmm, like go away?
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, Mmm-hmm.
HA: Because I used to go to sales over the, over at Vincennes there down [highway] 41.
ALC: When you say sales is this like farm sales and...
HA: No cattle sale
ALC:  Cattle sale!
HA: Bring horses and pigs and...
ALC: The animal sales.
HA: Yeah animal sales, and standing around, standing around they don’t know I’m colored, but
you can hear ‘em calling ‘em N***** [racial slur] this, N***** [racial slur] this, and N*****
[racial slur] that.
ALC: Even though they didn’t know you.
HA: No they don’t know me.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, Mmm-hmm.

start talking about...
ALC: [laughs] And they don’t know!
HA: Yeah they don’t know.
18
ALC: They don’t know because they...
[25:00] HA: See my barber knows.
ALC: Yeah.
HA: But they don’t know, they don’t know [they don’t know that Harry is Black].
ALC: So you get to hear things.
HA: Well yeah.
ALC: ‘Cause they think you’re white, yep, yep.
HA: Yep.
ALC: So are you proud of the fact that you come from Black farmers and you are a Black
farmer?
HA: Oh yeah.
ALC: Yeah.
HA: Yeah, can’t take that away from me.
ALC: They can’t take that away from you, yeah.
HA: When I go out like I got out and go to where I ain’t known, nobody knows it, nobody knows
it.
ALC: So you can kind of be secret.
HA: Yep.
ALC: Mmm-hmm, but you know.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Would you...
HA: Or just like, just like when we used to go to the theatre. I went to the Vincennes theatre
because we had to go clean up to the top row, sit in the top row [where African Americans were
forced to sit because the theater was racially segregated].
ALC: Mmm.
19
HA: Yep we just left.
ALC: Have to go all the way up in the balcony.
HA: Well now in Lawrenceville it used to be the same thing.
ALC: Lawrenceville, same thing.
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Segregated.
HA: Yeah you remember Joe Louis uh, Joe Louis uh, Joe Louis uh who won the Heavyweight
championship and we headed down there [unintelligible] what you call me and my dad and Vick

always [unintelligible] went upstairs to sit down where all the colored people sit.
ALC: Mmm-hmm.
HA: Sometimes they’d come get me, set me over in the white section.
ALC: Because they didn’t know.
HA: They just didn’t know, cause just had a little place [unintelligible] it wasn’t much bigger for
the colored and ‘em, much bigger than this room here.
ALC: Wow, tiny.
HA: Then the southside, they had a long kind of long upstairs.
20
ALC: But you knew [that he was Black], and you were proud [to be Black].
HA: Yeah.
ALC: Yep, yep.

ALC: [laughs] They couldn’t figure it out more power to ‘em? [laughter]
GC: Was voting ever an issue?
HA: No.
GC: No you could always vote.

ALC: Yep, and she said it is time their voices are added to the national conversation. And I'm,
I'm really grateful that you chose to add your voice.

did and what your parents did, and grandparents did, what day accomplished. It was a lot, it was
a lot. Thank you.
