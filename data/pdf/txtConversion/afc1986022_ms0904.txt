This modern world of science and invention is a particular interest to women, for the lives
of women who have been more affected by its new horizon and those of any other group.
Profound in strength, there have been accomplishments in the field of <gap> research, it
is in the home that the applications and scientific achievements have perhaps been most
far reaching. And it is through changing conditions there that women have become the
greatest beneficiaries in the modern scene. Science has released them from much of
the age-old drudgery connected with the process of living. Candle dipping, weaving, and
crude methods of <gap> manufacturing necesities are things of the past for an increasing
majority. Today, light, <gap> and power may be obtained by pushing buttons and <gap>
manufactured and appealing products of all the world are available at the <gap> door
<gap>. Indeed beyond that door she need not go, thanks to the miracles of modern
communication and transportation. Not only as applied science decreased the <gap>
in the home, but it has provided undue new economic opportunities for women. Today,
millions of them are earning their living on the conditions made possible only through a
basically <gap> system. Probably no scientific development is more startling than the
access of this new and growing economic independence upon women themselves. When
the history of our <gap> is written, it must be called as supremely significant for physical,
psychic and social changes women have undergone in these exciting decades. The <gap>
of the sociological evolution of the last half century should be largely credited to those who
have toiled in laboratories and those who have translated into practical use the proof of
such labors. When we hear from a man that a mechanized world would not be a pleasant
one in which to live, quite the contrary, it should be true and it can be true if the fine minds
have accomplished so much in the realms of applied science will unite with the same

enthusiasm to control our creation against social misuse. Obviously, research regarding
technological unemployment is as vital today as further refinement or production of labor
<gap> and comfort living devices. Among all the marvels of modern invention, that with
which I am most concerned is, of course, air transportation. Flying is. perhaps the most
dramatic of recent scientfic attainment. In the brief span of thirty odd years, the world has
seen an inventor's dream first materialized by the Wright brothers at Kitty Hawk become
an everyday actuality. Perhaps I'm prejudiced, but to me it seems that no other phase
of modern progress contrives to maintain such a venom <gap> of romance and beauty
coupled with utility <gap> aviation. Within itself, this industry embraces many of those
scientific accomplishments which yesterday seemed fantastic impossibilites. The pilot,
winging his way above the earth at two hundred miles an hour, talks by radio telephone to
ground stations or to other planes in the air. In sick weather he is guided by radio beams
and receives detailed reports of conditions ahead <gap> through special instruments and
new methods of meteorological calculations. He sits behind engines in the liability of which
measured by yardsticks of the past is all but
unbelievable. I, myself, <gap> which is carried in over the North Atlantic part of the
Pacific to and from Mexico city and the many times across this continent. Aviation, this
young modern giant, exemplifies the possible relationship of women and the creations of
science. Although women as yet have not taken full advantage of its use and benefits, air
travel is as available to them as to men. As so often happens in introducing the new or
changing the old, public acceptance depends particularly upon women than the attitude.
In aviation they are arbitrary of whether or not their families shall fly and if such, are a
potent influence. <gap> within the industry itself for women who work are still greatly
outnumbered, they are finding more and more opportunities for employment in the ranks
of this latest transportation medium. May I hope this movement will spread throughout all
<gap> of applied science and industry and that women may come to share with men the
joy of doing <gap> can appreciate <gap> most who have helped create.
