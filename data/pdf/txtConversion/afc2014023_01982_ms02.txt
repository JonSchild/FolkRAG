End of Introduction

00:00 
Great grandfather born in 1876. His son was Hall Davis II. 
Hall Davis II had his own business delivering ice in 
Plaquemine. When refrigeration came in, he rented out his 
car to the local funeral home as a limousine service. Davis’s 
family members through time very entrepreneurial. Hall 
Davis III graduated from mortuary school in 1949. Worked at 
Gilbert’s Funeral Home in Baton Rouge. In 1954 Davis III 
and his wife opened a funeral home in Port Allen. Funeral 
home celebrated its 60th year in business in 2014. As of 
2015, Hall Davis IV has been licensed 40 years in the trade. 
Everyone in the family through time has worked for 
themselves. “We take great pride in that.” 
 
02:14 
Coming through the 1960s civil rights era every African 
American was taught education was the key. Davis 
graduated from high school on Southern University campus. 
Went off to play football at Knoxville College (TN). Returned 
home to work in his dad’s grocery store at the time, then 
various chemical plants up and down the river before he 
made the decision to join the family business and attend 
mortuary school in Houston. Davis’s straight “A’s” transcript 
is framed on his office wall.  
 
O5:22 
Davis talked about the rigors of the curriculum at mortuary 
school. Far more difficult than his experience in college. 
Microbiology, chemistry (organic and inorganic), anatomy. 
Required to learn verbatim all bones and muscles in the 
body. All as a means to find the arteries which serve as the 
infrastructure for morticians to embalm bodies (“6-point 
injections”). Rigors of the school. “I think that was the 
foundation that made me a better funeral director today.” 
 
07:06 
Maintains relationships to this day with whites, Blacks, 
Hispanics who attended the Commonwealth Institute of 
Funeral Service with him in Houston.  
 
07:50 
Returned home. Worked at the family funeral home in Port 
Allen from 1954 on until he branched off with his own facility 
in north Baton Rouge in 2005. Maintains two other satellite 
facilities: the one in Port Allen, the other in Plaquemine. 
“People don’t like to cross bridges.”

08:55 
Furthered his education “about the environment and where 
he was” through memberships in Chamber of Commerce, 
Port Commission, Rotary, etc. Served as Deputy Coroner 
since 1982 in West Baton Rouge Parrish. Coroner adopted 
him because he knew how to draw blood.  
 
10:10 
“I’ll never forget…” Davis related story of working with the 
Coroner late at night. Unable to find the bullet in a shooting 
victim Davis came up with an ingenious solution. (Aside: 
“My daddy was one of the best embalmers in the world. Just 
phenomenal.”)  
 
12:20 
Explained what an embalmer does. Preserves, disinfects 
gives the body a lifelike appearance “for the family, for the 
final transition.” Restoration of features required skill set. 
 
13:03 
Davis began to relate a story about the oak trees lining the 
highways across the state as a tourist attraction. 
 
13:38  
Diverged into explanation of how reconstruction is done on 
a face that has been damaged. Plaster of paris used to 
replace missing bone structure because it sets quickly. Can 
put tissue back or use clay to mold replacement features. 
“It’s called restorative art, which is the restoration of facial 
features. A whole ‘nother’ world.” More explanation. Critical 
knowledge of chemistry required to mix solutions that will 
take the swelling down. Body is gravitated, feet down, to do 
so. “It’s an art to do what we do. Big time.” 
 
16:02 
“Very few people master the art of embalming.” Davis had 
no figures at hand as to how many embalmers there are in 
the U.S.. 
 
16:33 
Two licenses required in the industry, funeral director and 
embalmer. A person who has both is normally known as a 
mortician. 
 
17:11 
The Davis family lived in their Port Allen funeral home. 
Davis’s bedroom was 15 feet from the morgue. Davis would 
jump out of bed at night as young as 12 to ride the funeral 
home’s ambulances (another offshoot business) “‘cause I 
was a pretty big boy. I could pick up [someone injured or a 
dead body].” Davis got up, out, and learned. This helped 
him get over any type of fears. 
 
 
4 
17:33 
Davis resumed his story about the oak trees lining the 
highways in Louisiana. Collision with oak trees caused 
many deaths. Gave Davis’s father plenty of practice 
restoring facial features. Related story of his dad kicking the 
seat down in an auto involved in a wreck, then sending him 
in to retrieve the body. 
 
18:46 
“If you traveled with daddy, he was the kind of individual 
who had no fear of anything.” Davis described how his 
daddy taught them the rituals of deer hunting, after hiking 
three or four miles back in the woods. Safety measures, 
marking your route going in, etc.. Factored into Davis’s 
involvement with the Boy Scouts. 
  
20:51 
Once Davis returned from mortuary school his daddy was 
very open to his son’s new ideas. His daddy was his super 
instructor. “If I had a problem I could go to him.” Davis 
attended conventions with his daddy to keep current in the 
field.  
 
21:34 
Davis actually learned embalming from his daddy before he 
went to mortuary school. How to pick up arteries, how to 
restore facial features, mixing the right chemicals depending 
on what a person passed with. Bodies that can’t be restored 
require a closed casket. “Embalming is a very challenging 
science.” 
 
22:59 
Davis worked every facet of the funeral home in Port Allen 
including the wakes at night.  
 
24:00 
Changes in African American funeral rituals. When Davis 
was young, the practice was to take the body to the family’s 
home where it was placed in the living room for the wake. A 
velvet backdrop was set up with lamps to “make a nice little 
display for them.” A full coffee pot at the wake was part of 
Davis’s (III) service for his clients. The next day Davis (III) 
with his assistants would return to take the body to the 
church for he funeral. “That was the cultural thing back 
then,” Davis (IV) remarked. 
 
25:08 
End of first segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110345 
 
 
5 
00:00 
Practice among African Americans with the wake in the 
home started to fade as churches “started to get built a little 
bit bigger.” Wakes then began taking place at the church. 
Wakes took place at night. The next day they would have 
the dismissal with the body removed for burial. Those rituals 
have transcended today to...the first view for immediate 
family. All ritual compressed to one day. No burials in this 
area of Louisiana on Sundays. Not a law. Just a tradition. 
Not so in north Louisiana.  
 
01:25 
Davis described differences in funeral rituals from one 
denomination to the next. “We basically do Baptists and 
Catholics.” More detailed description followed, contrasting 
the two approaches. 
 
04:16 
Davis described how he interacts with his customers. About 
50 items need to be covered when making burial 
arrangements. More detail from Davis on the process 
including legalities that must be addressed. “If you are 
thorough and professional with them, you’ve gained their 
trust.”...“The way we console them is being on time; being 
properly dressed; being very professional; being kind and 
kind of hands on.” Also being very patient, not rushing the 
family. Leads to a tremendous relationship with the family. 
Become a part of the family. “That’s what this business is all 
about.” 
 
09:37 
Davis described innovations he has brought to the business. 
Where Davis grew up in West Baton Rouge every plantation 
had a church and a cemetery for people that stayed on that 
place. Learned the effect of the water table on grave sites. 
Talked about the mausoleum burial tradition in New Orleans 
given that the city is four feet below sea level. Also spoke to 
burial custom unique to New Orleans called the “reuse of 
the grave.” In 12 years time can reopen the grave, pull the 
draw, drop the casket to the level below and add another 
one on top.” Family can use same grave over and over. 
“Now here in Baton Rouge you don’t touch them until Jesus 
comes,” Davis remarked. Water table always an issue in 
Baton Rouge. Most times water must be pumped out before 
they put the vault in the grave. More details on required trust 
to maintain cemeteries.

14:10 
In with the new. Davis described his new mausoleum 
complex in detail. Seven hundred crypts available for 
starters. Described different burial options: abbeys (the 
basement); true companions (head to foot); companions 
(side by side); singles plus niches for cremains. Prices vary 
according to height. Cremation not a practice among  
African Americans, but in other ethnic groups combined 
figure is soaring towards 50%. 
 
15:57 
Davis described options available in crypt (name) plates. 
 
16:48 
Davis kept his daddy’s dream alive of growing the business. 
Commented on how his three business locations work “like 
an engine.” When one is not doing well, the others help pick 
up the slack. 
 
17:19 
Spoke to the period during integration in the 1960s. Many 
Blacks moved off the plantations in the Port Allen area to 
Baton Rouge proper. Many knew the Davis name. No 
written history of African Americans in West Baton Rouge 
Parish until 1997. Davis involved in documentation. Began 
with documentation of the cemeteries in the area. Spoke to 
what cemeteries offer in terms of revealing local history and 
how the dead were cared for.   
 
19:53 
Davis shared more details on his new mausoleum complex. 
Plan is to put 4000 graves on two acres of land. 
Includes niches for “oversize” persons to address that ever 
growing population.  
 
21:46 
Idea for mausoleum came from New Orleans practices. 
Davis has whole different perspective when he buries 
someone in the ground. “I don’t leave there 100%.” High, 
dry, revisit-able. After a burial at a mausoleum, has better 
feeling in Davis’s view that all is done properly. Davis 
added, there is a “whole lot more dignity to a mausoleum”. 
 
22:36 
Davis talked about being able to add something to the 
business for the next generation. He hopes that his son can 
carry on and expand the model all over the country.  
 
22:55 
Next building Davis wants to build in his mausoleum 
complex will have burial crips inside the chapel.   
 
23:13 
“What I’m also trying to do is reestablish the true meaning of 
a dignified funeral.”

23:38 
Shared comment of priest he met in New Orleans at a 
national convention. Priest: “I want to really commend you 
guys for what you do...You are the caregivers of what God 
created.” Davis: “That’s why funeral homes have such a 
high level of respect for the dead.” Ritual: Bath the bodies, 
wash the hair, clean the mouth, and eyes before 
embalming. Always put underclothes on the deceased. A 
high-level code of ethics in funeral service work. 
 
24:53 
Davis founder of 100 Black Men. To see the life taken of a 
young man, that’s what affects Davis the most. Davis has 
developed a written protocol for conducting funerals for 
victims of gang related crime.  
 
27:36  “We as a family run this business,” Davis commented. Wife, 
daughter, son all work in the business. 
 
28:03 
End of second segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
Note: Segments below recorded while walking with Davis 
through the funeral home. 
 
 
LS110346 
 
00:00 
Davis discussed his new mausoleum complex under 
construction. Marketing strategy. “For years and years 
churches had cemeteries of their own. Here’s an opportunity 
for you to have a cemetery of your own in my cemetery. If 
you (meaning his or church) buy it, I’ll put the picture and 
the name of your church on that building.” Each of the 20 
planned stand alone buildings in the complex will hold 220 
graves.  
 
00:41 
Davis pointed out his Hall’s Wall of Celebrants that runs the 
entire length of the hallway. Serves to let patrons know their 
loved ones are remembered always “and they’ll always be a 
part of this institution.” 
 
01:02 
Davis spoke about his state of the art selection room. Prides 
himself on offering a casket and services complete for 
$2695.00. “That’s kind of unheard of in the industry.” Price 
options include econo, traditional, elite and presidential 
packages. 
 
 
8 
02:32 
Responded to interviewers question on the new trend for 
natural burials. “Going green.” Segue-ways into popularity of 
cremations. “We (the funeral home business as a whole) 
tend to adopt different things based on different theologies 
and people’s wishes.” Mentioned another trend where the 
body is placed in a metal container, then through 
“hydrolysis” is pressured and pulverized. Burying in the 
traditional manner in a coffin “is more reverence to me.” 
 
04:54 
Davis defended the cost of burial. “Funeral homes are very 
expensive to operate. I will show you a million dollars worth 
of cars I got in the back.” Davis added. “I answer the phone 
seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Been doing it 40 years 
because I care about the families that I serve. But I also 
care about the relationships I have with them and I want to 
make sure this relationship is built for generations to 
come...so when you choose the profession those are the 
things you need to take into account.” 
 
05:28 
Wife now works with Davis as his manager. She remains 
excited after 10 years on site, “because she’s learning 
everyday. 
 
05:57 
Davis referred to his selling of stand alone mausoleums, 
dedicated to one church, as a form of community building. If, 
for example, ten churches buy into the concept “they could 
have one big function there to commemorate the ones that’s 
buried there...that could be an awesome bringing of 
community back together.”...“Everything tends to divide 
us...we have a very long ways to go.” 
 
06:56 
Davis explained some options for burial including elaborate 
custom designed bronze plaques for the grave (“good, 
better, and best”) and decorative touches for the coffin itself. 
“There ain’t many things we can’t do. That’s what it’s about, 
personalization.” The challenge is, how to create a 
celebration. Examples: being very authentic in the 
cemeteries you choose, military honors, types of stationary 
for registration book, thank you notes, musical tributes, floral 
expressions. 
 
09:18 
“You’ve got to be sharp on your feet to be able to present all 
of this to somebody who is grieving. Davis emphasized 
importance of making prearrangements. 
 
 
9 
9:54 
“African American community is kind of very traditional so 
you don’t do anything too far out of line.” Exception is with 
rolling stock where a traditional hearse is an option along 
with a “motorcycle hearse” (Davis is a biker), or a hearse 
that hooks to Davis’s ‘51 GMC truck geared for all truckers 
and antique car people. Davis plans to name his motorcycle 
hearse, “In Style”...as in, “I’m going out in style.” 
 
11:09 
Davis’s son and daughter amazed by their dad’s creativity. 
“How do you think all that up?”…“Spirit of the Lord is in my 
life, son. That’s where it comes from.”  
 
11:20 
“My whole thing is just building the business for the next 
generation.” Davis inspired other funeral directors across 
the country when he was national president of African 
American funeral directors association. 
 
11:37 
Davis commented on the organizational strength of his 
business. Everybody fills out a form to be held accountable 
on the job. Also to ensure customers are being served in a 
professional manner. 
 
12:49 
End of third segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110347 
 
00:00 
Explained his role in the organization “100 Black Men” 
founded over 20 years ago in Baton Rouge, now with 
national chapters. Composed of African American 
businessmen who mentor kids in their communities. Davis 
mentored in a school every Wednesday for 17 years,  
second through fourth grade. Shared his view on the need 
for a state-of-the-art Pre-K program, and a parenting skills 
center. 
 
02:02 
End of fourth segment. 
 
 
 
 
 
LS110348

00:19 
Davis pointed out some of his new inventory: new stretch 
hearse and new bumper pull hearse. “It’s (the bumper pull 
hearse) going to give a celebration that’s unbelievable.” 
Able to view casket--or body in the casket--through the 
etched glass. DVD screens mounted on either side for 
celebratory videos. Can be pulled by truck or motorcycle. 
License plate to read, “In style.” Davis views his new 
bumper pull hearse option as a way to give more added 
value to a funeral.  
 
02:31 
“Whatever your lifestyle was you’re going out in that style.”  
02:34 
End of fifth segment.

Funeral home can accommodate 700 people under the roof 
in two chapels. 
 
00:20  
Wife, daughter, son, godchild, all work at funeral home. Also 
one high school, one college student, and one ex-inmate 
sponsored under a reentry program. “We give him a job and 
help him get placed back in society.” 
 
01:03 
“We just working hard to make sure that our legacy in this 
business and that name, at 138 years, be, etched in the 
hearts and minds of the people we serve...when you touch 
the hearts and minds of people, you’ve done what God 
wants you to do.”
