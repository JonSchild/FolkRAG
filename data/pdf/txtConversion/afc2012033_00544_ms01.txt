VC: Okay so this is Thursday, the first of August and I’m sitting here at the dining table at Adrienne 
Gilbert’s farm home; the old brick farmstead, right? 
AG: Mhmm. 
VC: And I’m here also with Nick, and I’m going to ask each of them a couple questions then we’re going 
to go on to talk a bit about farms through the years. So Adrienne first, I’d just like to have you give your 
full name and then give a little bit of personal history about how you got to this point – who you were, 
how you grew up, and how you got into this farm business. 
AG: Well I married Don Gilbert at 17 and he had the farm already and I’ve been here ever since. 
VC: And what was the year of your birth, do you mind? 
AG: 1939. I married at 17 and we were married over 49 years when he passed. The sons took it over and 
now the grandsons are here. 
VC: So let’s tell a little bit about your own family before we get into life on the farm and all that. 
AG: Well I was brought up in Parishville and I had a sister and a brother and my father and mother lived 
there. 
VC: And their names? 
AG: Oliver and Elizabeth Perry. 
VC: And you lived in town? 
AG: Yes. 
VC: So you had no background with farming until you got here? 
AG: No. 
VC: Your family had not been on a farm before? 
AG: Dad’s grandfather was Noah Link and he had raised hogs and traded in furs; he was a Canadian. 
VC: Nick, sort of the same general introduction here. 
NG: Well my full name is Nicholas Anthony Gilbert; I was born in ’89. I’m the youngest of three in my 
family; my parents are Anthony and Anne. My father and Uncle Andy own the farm. I grew up…well, less 
than a mile down the road! I went to school right in Parishville and came home and followed my father 
around. 
AG: You graduated from Cornell. 
NG: Yeah, pretty much grew up running around the farm and after high school I went four years for 
animal science bachelor at Cornell. I joined the agricultural fraternity, AGR, and then upon graduation I 
returned home and I’ve been here working and it’s going real well so far. 
VC: Now unlike your grandmother then, you started right out in the farm life. As a small boy you were 
doing things around the farm? 
NG: Yeah and it’s kind of been interesting for me because I’m not very old but I’ve actually gone through 
a relatively large progression of our own dairy. Like when I was born we would’ve been about 80, 90 
…well maybe 90 cows. And then we went to a bigger parlor and two hundred cows and then before I 
went to college we tripled in size and through college we still were expanding pretty rapidly. And even 
now we’re really just settling from our most recent expansion. In our most recent expansion we added 
four hundred cows at once which was only from about 700 to 800 to the 1200 we’re at now but that’s 
more than a lot of farms. It’s something. 
VC: It is. So what’s the total now Nick? 
NG: We’re milking about 1200 cows now, but I guess one thing about our farm, and the Northeast in 
general, is we’re pretty vertically integrated. Our dairy raises all our own replacements and handles wet 
calves and everything right up through. So we have a lot more livestock than a dairy that’s just a milking 
herd. And I don’t know the total number of animals even. 
0:04:41 
VC: So Adrienne, you married at 17, Don already was on the farm, running the farm? 
AG: Yes, his parents had bought it in 1930. And they had worked it until ’45, and then they got into the 
retail milk business. And twelve years before we got married in ’57 he lived with his parents in 
Parishville. This was a hardship really for me, to come from town and come down here. There weren’t 
many conveniences then. And you know I stressed education and it’s paid off big time, and I’m grateful 
for that. 
VC: Stressed education in the raising of your children? 
AG: Children and my grandchildren. So I’ve got four educated children and nine educated grandchildren 
and I’m tickled to death about that, because it’s made the farming easier too. 
VC: Do you want to talk a little about what you were saying about hardships, how life was on the farm? 
AG: Well you know we didn’t have a drilled well; we didn’t have washer and dryers. I mean the house 
was in dire condition when I moved into it. There were 23 windows in the house and none of them were 
whole. We had a wood furnace, all those sorts of things that you just have to gradually improve upon. 
VC: Had the house been lived in right along? 
AG: Yes it had. But he had rented it and of course he wasn’t a harsh landlord. I had to learn to paper and 
all that sort of stuff. My mother-in-law taught me how to putty windows. But I think the thing is you’ve 
got to get up every day and do the best you can. 
VC: Sure. So during those early years, the farm was staying at about the same size? 
AG: We had different times we had hired men and different times they lived with us. And I quite often 
fed them. Then as we bought more property, where Nick is living now, we bought that place and there 
was a hired man that went in there. 
NG: Well not where I live, dad’s house, where I grew up. Was that the first farm you bought? 
AG: Yes, I think it was. 
NG: Because Taylors would have still been there. 
AG: Yeah and the Kelly property, maybe we bought that in ’74; mostly for the land because it adjoined 
ours. 
0:07:49 
VC: Was it a conscious decision to expand, or did it just happen? Does that make any sense? 
NG: I’d have to say that in my understanding it was both. Because when Pa was here and starting out 
you weren’t really thinking about expanding, but you were slowly. And then my father’s philosophy has 
pretty much been expansion. 
AG: Don was very progressive, though, as far as trying new things. Because he had one of the first 
milking parlors in the area and we bought the Kelly property because we knew we were going to need 
more land. And you didn’t want urban people coming in on you, because of the older and the hardship 
that can cause. 
NG: And I mean Pa had the first square baler, first eight row planter, and in order to justify it you 
naturally expand. And people didn’t talk about it the way we do now, you know, nobody sat down and 
wrote ten year business plans but you just worked every day and that’s what you did. 
AG: And I milked cows for ten years and we had no help here at all. And Tony would get disgusted with 
his father because Tony was in Cornell at the time, and Don didn’t trust hired help, truthfully. And we 
kind of made up our mind that we were going to stick it out and I kept saying to them “get an education 
and get out of here!” because it was hard. But they didn’t, they came home. 
VC: Interesting. 
AG: Yeah it was interesting. You know, Varick, it’s hard to understand why some farms succeed and 
some don’t. And the thing I think with ours…Don and I didn’t agree all the time. But sometimes he gave 
90% and sometimes I did. And we agreed on how to raise the children with a good work ethic and an 
education. And we paid for it all. They are all stepping out of four year schools without owing a penny, 
even the grandchildren. It’s quite a gift when you think of the student debt across the country today. 
And that makes thirteen. 
VC: Good for you. But you made a comment just a moment ago…did you say you wanted them to leave 
and wanted them to get out? 
AG: I did. At one time I did because it was very hard here at times. I mean lots of times at 10:30 at night 
I’d say to Don that I couldn’t work another minute. And he’d say “okay, go on in and I’ll finish up.” But 
they’re more progressive, I’d say, in hiring help and dealing with them. And they’re more progressive in 
how to pay them. I mean none of our employees work a six or seven day week with half a day off. And 
we pay them quite well. The salary for three months is $250,000, so that’s a million dollars a year. And I 
mean some of them have health benefits and so on and so forth. If you treat them well, they’ll treat you 
well. But you can’t expand and do it alone. And Don was from the old school; he’d been brought up 
during the Depression, his father one time got a 35 cent milk check. 
VC: Oh really. 
AG: His father threw it on the floor. And then his mother picked it up and…but back then they weren’t 
totally dependent on that because they had their own food, the milk, the canned goods, and the meat 
and everything. But no, I said to them, “farming is drudgery and debt; get out of here.” And now I’m in 
good shape. They got out, tried something different and the ones that want to come home can, and 
some will never come home. And then I went to work at the post office and I was a rural carrier for over 
ten years so I had the benefit of more Social Security and health benefits. 
0:12:54 
VC: So you said you actually milked the cows for twelve years, and then you did the letter carrier? 
AG: Yes, yes. 
VC: But you have continued to have a role on the farm today, right? 
AG: Oh yes, I love it! Truthfully I love the place. I mean I love the beautiful old brick house and… the 
beauty of Don; he never raised his voice in all the years I knew him. He just kept working along, working 
along, and doing the best he could. 
NG: He was arguably better-tempered than any of us here now. 
AG: Yeah and he was better-natured than his father. He was a beautiful person, but he did have these 
funny ideas and I think it was because they were poor. Because back when I came here he was still 
cleaning the gutters by hand! He didn’t have a gutter cleaner; he’d back the spreader down the barn and 
shovel it all by hand, and that was hard work. 
VC: On the other hand, Nick, you’ve said that your grandfather was one of the first to have a square 
baler, and a couple other things. So he was frugal on one hand because he felt he had to be. 
AG: Right. 
NG: I guess I’d almost say he was bold in a sense. He wasn’t afraid of working and he’d work sometimes 
even too hard on things. But if there was something newer, bigger, better or a better piece of 
technology that he knew would make money he wasn’t afraid of doing it. So I guess rather than put your 
own comfort first and fix the small things, take the big steps that will make you more money and grow. 
And that’s why he was able to grow. 
AG: And he was a very hard worker. I think that was part of his problem with help; they didn’t want to 
work like he did. And he didn’t condone that; he expected everybody to work like he did. 
VC: Now, he didn’t have a college education. 
AG: No, he didn’t. 
VC: But he must’ve been – you used the word progressive earlier, to the point where he was going and 
buying his own equipment and so forth –he was a student of farming, was he not? How did he know? 
Was he learning that through reading, agricultural groups? 
AG: Yes he did. And I encouraged him to go and do whatever; you know he went on a People to People 
goodwill tour for three weeks, to Spain and Russia and all over. He hadn’t really traveled much until 
after we got married. 
NG: But that was unheard of then. 
AG: It was. 
VC: Now when would that have been? 
AG: Well that was when we were married; [to Nick:] your father was seven. That would’ve been in ’67. 
And I think it made him more interested in the new methods. 
NG: But also he liked to learn. Like hunting or fishing or outdoor sports would’ve been his other passion, 
so to speak. And he always was into something else. And in his later years when he wasn’t as busy with 
the farm, of course Dad and Andy were more prevalent, he tried to get a quality deer management 
group together, and tried to get the whole community to band together and do better at managing the 
population. And that was kind of unheard of, and it wasn’t very popular back then because hunters 
didn’t like it. But he tried to sway people and he was an entrepreneur. He tried a lot of crazy things—
selling concrete, selling baling twine. 
AG: Well he rented out cows, where they paid us so much per month for the rent of the cow. That 
brought us in extra income. 
0:17:27 
VC: One of the things I’ve been curious about in these different conversations I’ve had with people—you 
know, some people have talked about 4-H as being important. Some people have talked about 
Extension, and then almost all of the contemporary farmers like your father’s generation are really 
getting into leadership positions, like Farm Credit. 
AG: Well Andy’s on the board you know. He’s chairman of the Farm Credit board for the whole 
Northeast. 
NG: I think a lot of that— 
AG: Comes from having the education, don’t you think so? 
NG: Yeah, and also you have to think of it this way: there’s less and less farmers, so the ones that are out 
there need to essentially take responsibility. Somebody’s gotta step up. You know my father’s not too 
keen on it, he doesn’t like it, it’s not his thing, and he doesn’t enjoy it. 
AG: But it frees Andy to go. Because truthfully, Varick, Andy couldn’t be gone as much as he is if Tony 
and Nick weren’t here. 
NG: But Andy also enjoys it and does a better job than Dad or I would because of the personality traits. 
I’ve become active in the Farm Bureau, but it’s hard. 
VC: Not your kind of thing so much? 
NG: I don’t mind it per se, but I’m young and if Andy’s gone already, it’s harder to leave. 
AG: And that’s a load off my mind because Don would take off and do these other things and I was left 
with these people we employed. And I knew things weren’t being done right but I couldn’t do anything 
about it because I had small children. And the worst thing that would happen was the milk production 
would drop because they weren’t milking the cows like they should or they weren’t graining them like 
they should. And every time Don came home he could bring everything back up, but he just hated to 
stay tied down to it and it was hard. 
0:19:53 
VC: So Adrienne, in more recent years what has your role on the farm been? 
AG: Well, I do all of the books and I pay all the bills. And I help Andy with the payroll, but he’s put that 
on a computer. So I have all the checks ready to go in on Friday morning and we do that together. And 
then I do the landscaping; I do all the mowing and stuff. That’s pretty much it now. 
VC: [laughs] Pretty much it! 
NG: Yeah, ten acres! 
VC: So you also do like quarterly reports and taxes and all that? 
AG: No, we have Farm Credit do all that. It is a huge thing and they’re up to date on all the regulations. 
And every week we file the federal taxes electronically, and the state taxes; and they’re all on computer 
you know. 
NG: Actually in terms of talking about growth and whatnot, especially a dairy or any agricultural 
industry, you have to mention lending agencies, especially Farm Credit and agricultural associations in 
general, because normal banks can’t service us the way they can and they’re not as stable. 
AG: They don’t really want us. 
NG: Yeah because it’s such a high volatility, and farms couldn’t have done what they have in the 
Northeast without the money and capital to do it. Nobody could expand the way we have without a 
good lending agency. 
VC: So are these state and federal funds behind some of this? 
NG: No…oh I’d have to remember all that, I knew at one point. The ACAs were set up by federal law in 
the thirties or something; a grant that actually set them up. And then they actually have a certain set of 
regulations, different than other banks, that allows them to do certain things. Essentially they can only 
lend to certain types of loan volume, being agricultural, so it forces them but also they’re more 
committed to us. Commercial banks get into Ag lending but then they can also get out and call your 
loan; you know you’d be done for! In order to realize what we have, or any farms going forth in the 
future, it is important to have that. And they do a good job. 
AG: That’s the other issue, though, is money. I mean we handle a lot of money but you have to be aware 
of your bills. Because in the end, after you’ve paid everything, there isn’t that much left over and you 
cannot afford to lose the discounts on a feed bill today. A feed bill here is $200,000 a month. If you get a 
$20,000 feed bill the discount is $1000, you’d go under if you weren’t on top of your payments. 
0:23:11 
VC: One of the things I’ve been learning about, you know I grew up in a farming community but was not 
a farmer, but I knew enough about it to speak the language. But this process for me has been a real 
learning experience about how tight the margins are. 
NG: Oh, wicked. 
VC: How things are that just one little shift of something makes a huge difference. 
NG: But that also speaks to what you see in the community. There’s a lot of slander to dairy especially 
across the U.S., in factory farms and this and that. Well it’s not all the farmers’ decisions, it’s just that if 
we’re going to remain competitive we have to reach the economies of scale and we have to grow. 
Otherwise you need to look for niche markets or alternate sources of income or something. This farm 
has three whole families, or two now? 
AG: You could say three, honey, because I’m living here. That was the other thing, we didn’t take any 
money out of here when Don and I turned it over to them, because that can cripple the younger 
generation. I’m very happy to be here with life use of the house and they pay the bills. And if I needed or 
wanted money they’d see that I had it. But you cannot take a million dollars, one generation can’t, and 
expect the other generation to succeed; it just isn’t going to happen. 
VC: You two have reached the point where you’ve seen a very large operation. Do you think, not really 
to you but just in observation, that the small farm that was doing okay twenty years ago, is that future 
gone, in dairy particularly? 
NG: I believe there’s a threshold…I’d say yes and no. You need to be small enough that you can stay 
below a certain equipment size and labor issue, maybe one hired hand or whatever, where you can 
basically do a majority of the labor yourself. Otherwise you need to get big enough to where you can 
utilize what you have, actually afford labor. It’s my observation that that two to three hundred cow 
size…you’ve got more cows than you can take care of yourself, you’ve got to have a certain amount of 
crops, you need a line of equipment to service those crops, but you can’t run your equipment steady so 
you’re not actually maximizing that. You’re not even maximizing your parlor. Where like a farm our size 
or any larger dairy maximizes everything, including labor. Because even like this week we’re pouring a 
bunker; that’s not normal farm work, we usually hire it done. But we’ve got four or five guys who don’t 
want a week off. They’ve got to make a living too. So we need to come up with labor for them in 
between the cuttings of hay, and that’s a challenge. You can’t just send your labor home but if you have 
them…And that’s a lot of the reason we’ve tried to become vertically integrated because people will say 
they’re gonna cut this or that and save on labor; although labor isn’t a fixed number it kind of is in a way, 
you know you don’t usually send people home. So you might as well have something for them to do. 
0:27:01 
VC: Exactly, I understand. Now speaking of labor, I’ve found in doing this cross-section of farms, I’ve had 
a little bit of conversation with Andy about this. But I’d like your observations too about the use of 
migrant labor and maybe immigrant labor? I know you don’t, or haven’t, but what are your observations 
about how that works or doesn’t work? 
AG: I think there are a lot of good people here that you can hire, but I do think you’ve got to treat them 
like you’d want to be treated yourself. I mean maybe you’ve got to be a little more patient in training 
them, but we try to bend over backwards. I mean you can’t be riding them steady every time you see 
somebody standing. And we even feed them; we have treats like pizza or doughnuts or whatever. And 
we’ve got whole families here; somebody will come and they’re obviously happy and then they’ll go and 
tell their relatives. We’ve got two or three families here, haven’t we Nick? 
NG: Yeah. I’ve worked on dairies with both. You know we’re unique in the very Northeastern New York 
where I know just recently unemployment in St. Lawrence Country dipped back under 10% but it was up 
higher, double digit unemployment rates in surrounding counties, and the per capita income here is 
really low. So we take pride in the fact that we can provide. I mean really essentially this is a family 
business that’s providing 30 plus, closer to 40 jobs to a local community. We try to be very unbiased 
when hiring people, but I know especially with the turnover in milkers, they won’t hire anyone that’s 
very far away. Because when they first come they really need the money and want to work. But after 
not very long, any travel distance at all and people don’t last. You need people that are close. 
AG: Well they usually come and they don’t have a decent vehicle to start with. 
VC: Then the cost of transportation too. 
AG: Exactly. 
NG: Because these aren’t super high-paying jobs, you know, milking cows isn’t glamorous. 
VC: Nick, would you call it a living wage? 
NG: Oh for sure, I think so. We’re way above average, minimum wage, and actually farms all across New 
York State pay way above minimum wage, which is one of those things that we struggle with. People 
want to regulate farms more, but we’re already paying way above minimum. It wouldn’t actually change 
us; it’s the other things, over time and such. And what I’ve found with a lot of our labor is that they 
could get other jobs but what works out is that it’s steady. Like our milkers get five shifts a week, so they 
know they have to drive here five times and they’re going to get about 50 hours. Every week is 
consistent. They might work at the supermarket, have to drive there seven or eight times and end up 
with 25, 30, or 40 hours, but they don’t make the money by the time they take out travel costs. 
VC: And they can also be cut on a whim, a manager could cut their hours. 
NG: Right, and I tell people that, I say “how many hours are you looking to work?” and they don’t know. 
But you’ve got to know because that’s what it’s gonna be! 
0:31:06 
VC: Now Nick, my understanding was you work primarily with the crops, is that right? 
NG: Yes, I mean my own theory in my head was I’ve grown up just following Dad around –my father is 
my best friend –and he handles the crop side of things so I’ve definitely done more of that. But when I 
went to school I made a point to study more biology and the cow side of things. 
AG: Herd health, too. You’re very good at that. 
NG: Yeah, well that’s where we make our money. And the beauty of it is –my father, Andy, and I all went 
to Cornell—we can all pretty much replace each other if need be. We may not like it, but we can. So it’s 
comforting to me to have my father and Andy there so I can ask questions or do anything, so I pretty 
much try to do whatever I want and I know that if I fail or stumble I can always go to them. 
VC: So what you’re saying is even though they’ve kind of specialized for the sake of the operation, that if 
need be Andy could step in on the crop side and your dad could step in on the animal side? 
AG: Exactly. 
NG: Yeah, I mean my father can breed cows and run an IV. Obviously we’re not as good as Andy; we’re 
out of practice, but I have a very unique view of the farm. Ever since I’ve come home I’ve gotten the 
opportunity to work a lot more with my uncle and that’s been fun. I’m much closer to him now than I 
ever have been, but I work with him and with dad. Sometimes it becomes very hard because the 
problem with it is it’s confusing for the men. Sometimes I show up in the field crew and I’m the boss or 
in charge of a certain faction but all of a sudden I’m gone, but that’s just the nature of the beast, I can’t 
help it. And also it’s aggravating to me because I have a lot of my own jobs that I can’t get done because 
I’m running here or there. 
AG: Well he’s an excellent welder for one thing. 
VC: Oh, okay. 
NG: Right, so we built a very big shop and we have a very capable shop for a farm, more than most 
farms. And with the gravel pit business – 
AG: And see there’s a sideline that other farmers don’t have. 
NG: I mean there are days where I’m in the gravel pit for several hours, in the shop for several hours, 
and I’ll wind up at the barn. Basically people don’t know where I am; they can’t catch me! 
AG: But you know it’s a comfort to me, because now there’s always one of them here, so if there’s a 
problem. 
VC: This is an unrelated question to what we talked about before, but do you produce much of your own 
food for your table? 
AG: No. 
NG: No, not at all. I’m stuck on efficiency. My girlfriend wants a garden and I pick on her and say “listen, 
my time’s better spent working on something else.”  
VC: So you can go to the farm stand? 
NG: Well no, I can come down here…you know some days it’s really hard to see, but like, breeding a cow 
or something; if the value of a pregnancy is $900, if you get one cow pregnant then you made more 
money right there than you could possibly save by doing any other thing. 
AG: And I mean they can come in here and help themselves to whatever they want to eat, it’s not a big 
deal. 
VC: Sure. But I guess one of the things our project is about is the changes. And clearly most farmers at 
least fifty years ago had a garden and probably butchered a cow or something. 
NG: Oh yeah. 
AG: We still do butcher animals and take it to Liberty and have it ground or cut up. And if we have three 
or four animals – because you know today they won’t even let you load a cow on a truck if it’s got a 
broken leg. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with that cow and it’s a shame to send it to a rendering 
place, so we send it to a slaughterhouse. And then we would divide all that meat up among the 
employees, and they love it! 
NG: Yeah because with this many animals – 
AG: They’ll get caught in a grate or something 
NG: I’ve had one make it to breeding age who was a freemartin, no reproductive tract. Slipped through 
as she was born as a bull and somebody mixed it up or whatever. We had one make it to almost a year 
old and somebody looks and says “That’s a bull!” Got tagged as a heifer when it was born and grew right 
up through and no one noticed. With this many animals running around there’s things that make it 
through the cracks and if you’ve got a two-year-old heifer, you’ve already spent the money, you can’t 
get it back. So by giving it to the men it doesn’t cost us anymore than what we’ve already spent, other 
than the butchering. Those heifers are good eating! 
AG: And it’s beautiful meat. It’s better than you could buy downtown. But you see, when I started out 
here, by the time I was 21 I had three small children; there was no way I could garden. I didn’t have a 
washer or dryer; I had a wringer type washer and we’d hang them out and they’d freeze. 
VC: But you drank your milk and all. Did you do that? 
NG: No, I was going to bring that up, we don’t! And people are dumbfounded we make that much milk 
in a day and we don’t drink it. But for one thing, there’s no way to get it out of the tank. 
AG: See, it goes directly to the tank. Besides, we had the retail milk business back then. 
NG: So you used to drink it. And my mother used to come down when we had a smaller tank and get 
milk, but partially I’m plenty heavy; I don’t need to drink whole milk! And then logistically it’s just a 
challenge. 
AG: But I have to give Don a lot of credit too because he had a beautiful disposition and he never got 
mad, never swore at anybody, and consequently the children didn’t either. I know farms where they 
speak poorly to their employees, but you can’t do that and expect for them to give their best. 
0:37:56 
VC: Nick, you said you’re all about efficiency. Is that a message that comes out of Cornell? 
NG: Yes, I would say. And one of the things I noticed at Cornell – we used to laugh at each other, but my 
friends and I were from all over New York State but also from out of state, usually from larger dairies 
and lived together in the fraternity – but when we’d go to do something, it was laughable. We’d be 
trying to figure out the best way to pack people in a vehicle and everything! Everybody’s so used to 
pushing hard, and we have to to be successful in this business. And then once you live that it’s not like 
you can turn it off. Even when we’re out doing things for leisure we’re going at it. 
VC: So farming today –I’m going to play devil’s advocate for a moment – is it strictly a business? 
AG: I think it kind of has to be if you’re going to be this large, because let’s face it, with the taxes alone 
you’ve got to make money or you couldn’t keep the land. 
NG: I would say it’s a double-edged sword; it’s yes and no. We operate as a business needs to and that’s 
how I think and that’s how we live. I’m only 23 and I carry a pad and a pen because I have to take notes. 
Just the sheer number of supplies to keep this place moving, and I’m trying to be efficient. So every time 
I go to town I wind up going to ten different places because everyone needs a little something to keep 
things moving. But on the other hand, although it’s a business, once in a while I can still go to lunch with 
my father. Dad and I are there, and we don’t any more than pass during the day. I go three or four days 
sometimes without seeing my father, but then there’s other days we can go to lunch. 
AG: On the other hand, Tony comes in every day for breakfast and I see him. We know what’s going on. 
We just love it, really; I mean I love the family closeness, working together with them, and they’ve 
succeeded and I’m happy about that. 
NG: And this farm’s unique in that a lot of farms have quarterly meetings and a very heavy structure, but 
we don’t. We’re not paper pushers and we don’t have a big structure. But it is, it’s two brothers and me; 
we don’t need to sit down and have meetings. We don’t have set policies. I know a lot of farms where 
one owner can’t spend over $5,000 without talking to everybody. We all kind of just do what we want. 
AG: And we take care of our people at home; my mother died here and my husband died here. No 
nursing homes, no costs like that that ruined us. 
0:41:22 
VC: How do you feel about the term “factory farm?”  
NG: You know I laugh because I can look at it from a lot of different ways. If you look at it from a biology 
standpoint, I can comfortably say we do as good as anyone else could, to the animals themselves. We’re 
more set up for it; like every cow that’s over a third lactation gets an IV just as a pick-me-up. It’s not 
necessary, costs a little money, but we do it just because. We can afford all that and you don’t even 
think of it. And the herdsman gives IVs everyday; he can hit a vein instantly, it’s easy for him. He’s better 
than me! 
AG: Is that Brad? 
NG: Brad, yeah. Jim can do it, and Andy can do it. You see so many cows and since you have more cows 
you see more things, you have more on hand, and you’re more capable because you’ve dealt with it 
before. And the vet is here regularly just because he needs to be; there is so much going on. But it also 
means you take care of all the small things that come up. Where on a smaller farm where you’re more 
stressed for money or time, it’s harder. And that’s not saying small farmers don’t because they know 
their cows. But what also amazes me is our herdsman that works with them every day knows a lot of 
them by number, just reading it off the paper. 
VC: Andy and I had a little discussion about –this may sound corny -- cows having personalities and even 
the idea that they could be pets? 
AG: Well these animals aren’t abused and anybody can walk through the herd… and you go into some 
farms and you can tell they’ve been hit, and they’re scared and you wouldn’t want to be around them. 
And we wouldn’t allow that here. 
NG: I think also though it comes full circle to labor and everything. You hire people that you like because 
you have to work with them every day. And it’s monkey-see-monkey-do; you hire a lot of really young 
people and some of them have had drug problems or whatever but one of the first things we tell them is 
we don’t put up with any animal abuse, whatsoever. I don’t care if we have to fire you and put you on 
unemployment, you’re gone. And there’s a culture that develops among your employees and I think 
we’re fortunate to have a very good one. And it almost becomes a problem because people will pet 
cows and then you walk into a group of 200 – now 90% of them are scheduled so most of them start 
meandering out of the pen—but there’ll be like five or six that’ll come toward you because they want to 
be pet! And it makes it hard to get anything done. There’s one cow they call ‘Andy’s cow’ because she’ll 
come through the gate and stop and stand there and look in the vet area and wait for him. If he goes out 
and pets her behind the ear she’ll walk to the pen on her own. If he doesn’t she’ll stand there until the 
whole group’s pushed out and they have to push her back to the pen! 
AG: I can see what they say about factory farms; they don’t think the human element is there anymore. 
But it’s still here even though this would appear to be a factory farm. 
VC: Well the reason I brought it up is that I’ve heard it used in a very negative way. Of course certainly 
there are farms even larger than yours, but Andy was talking in both times I interviewed him and at 
some length he’s very conscious of the cooling of the animals, the fans. 
NG: Oh, well not only that though, it works both ways. It’s animal comfort but it’s also money. And 
that’s what I try to explain to anyone who doesn’t know about animal agriculture. It’s in our best 
interest to make the cows happy; they make more milk. 
AG: Production drops if you don’t have them comfortable in the heat. They can’t stand it, so you’ve got 
to have sprinklers and fans. 
NG: These people that say farmers abuse cows...it’s laughable to us. 
AG: I think probably some people do. 
VC: Oh, I’m sure they do. 
NG: I think to me the biggest problem with live agriculture, live animals wouldn’t ever be the owners or 
the people in charge; it would be if you get disgruntled employees. Some people are not meant to work 
with animals. We have to hire a certain number of people and you don’t always know who you’re going 
to get. You could fire them and try to watch, but you can’t be there 24 hours a day. 
AG: But all you have to say is “This isn’t working out for us.” You don’t have to be nasty, or call them 
names. 
VC: I don’t quite know how to ask this question, but I think it has to be an important question for a 
farmer. And that is the importance of the land to you, in a philosophical sense. How do you feel about 
being out on the land? Is it just part of the efficiency or is there something important about being close 
to the land? 
AG: We love it! Don’t we? 
NG: Yeah, well there are multiple views of everything, again. I love owning land. 
VC: Owning land? 
NG: Yeah! It’s equity that never depreciates; it’s awesome. I think the smell of dirt! There’s something 
about going out there…you know, why do people have flowers or gardens? We like to watch things grow 
as humans, and we get to do that on a large scale. Then if you go from the environmental point of view, 
that land is also our livelihood so we want to treat it better than anybody else. 
AG: Pride in your property too. I can see the difference since I came here in ’57; the way the place 
looked and the way it looks today. I had a push mower with no motor on it when I came. And last week 
Tony got me a better rider because it had a better seat! [laughter] So I told him earlier I’d rather have a 
decent mower than a new car. And they’re going to leave the old barn standing because I like the idea, 
and it’s been here since his great-grandfather bought. It’s going to be my garage rather than take the 
whole thing down. 
0:48:53 
VC: So Nick, you’re 23 years old; do you see yourself here 40 years from now? 
NG: Yeah. And that’s the other thing. You talk about land…I know one of the things we talked about at 
Farm Bureau is that farmers are often the best candidates for school boards and town boards because 
we’re business people that are dedicated to the community because we’re there. We own a lot of 
equity, and we’re essentially stuck here. It’s not a business that moves. I’ve actually been rolling the idea 
around in my idea about becoming active in the school board or something now because at some point 
in my life I’d like to have children, and they’re gonna go to school. So you’d like to do something. 
AG: He lives up at the Snell place you know. 
VC: Oh you do. Is that the stone house? 
AG: No not the stone house, the Stevens place. You knew we bought that? 
VC: Yeah Andy had told me that. Do you own the stone house too? 
AG: No. 
VC: Is that still in the Snell family? 
AG: Gary Senior has it. And he kept a certain amount of acreage; I’m not sure how much. 
NG: It’s not much. But I think that was all sectioned out before we bought the farm. 
VC: Speaking of acreage, you’ve got a heck of a lot of it; what you own, what you lease and rent. 
NG: Right and you know we’re always looking for more. 
AG: We bought land this year again. 
VC: Is that eventually going to be one of the real limits placed on farms? 
NG: It already is. Land is finite and good agricultural land is even less. And that’s why to me it’s just 
sickening to see people build these postage stamp standard houses and they put them in the middle of 
fields. You’re never going to make a productive field out of that again, ever. 
VC: What about them building on the roadside and leaving the fields? 
NG: Well that sounds great and all but it doesn’t happen. And then people just have a fit. They don’t like 
tractor trailers on the road, that it’s dangerous --- 
AG: They don’t like the smell. 
NG: -- or the smell of manure. Well the one barn up there produces 18 million gallons of manure a year. 
We have to move that over certain acreage to avoid for one, we need it other places, but also you 
couldn’t dump it all behind the barn; it’d be a nightmare. 
AG: And it’s fertilizer, Varick! 
NG: People don’t understand that with the scale of things we’re dealing with we need trucks that big. 
VC: What about the odor issue? 
AG: We don’t have too much trouble with that, do we? 
NG: We’re pretty good. Even our close neighbors that have been around, if they’re having a graduation 
party or whatever we tell them to tell us. That’s the other thing with our size; we’ve got so much going 
on that I can easily spread on this side of Parishville as I can on that side, all I’ve got to do is drive the 
spreader over and tell the trucks to go somewhere else. So we’re very flexible. And actually size helps us 
with that, and the same thing with labor. There’s enough employees here that if someone needs a day 
off we can usually get someone to cover. 
AG: And we pay them for sick days and they get paid vacation. We bought a farm though from a lady 
and she’d lived on it her whole life and after we bought it she started complaining about the smell. I 
mean she was on a farm!  
NG: And that’s the other thing: the farms were here first. Smell is part of nature. And I laugh because it’s 
only a matter of days! 
VC: Isn’t the Lagoon system different though? I’ve never had it explained to me. 
AG: Well that’s injected underground, most of our Lagoons are, aren’t they Nick? 
NG: Well no.  
AG: I mean Casella. 
NG: Yeah but that’s totally different. The thing is some Lagoons when you first stir, it would be bad right 
around the farm. But if you’re within range of the farm I can’t help you much there. The beauty of it is 
all the people up in Parishville we rent land from, we’re gonna spread the whole parcel in a day. And 
then ideally I’d like to be tilling it in the same day if I could because you capture more nitrogen that way. 
So really you might smell it for a few days. So actually I would say that for the majority of landholders, a 
bigger farm probably smells less. But there is a smell there! 
0:53:56 
VC: I don’t want to keep you much longer because you’ve been really helpful, and I hope there are 
things you might like to add. I think I’m going to go back to the question I asked a moment ago, about 
being here in 40 years. You really are committed to agriculture, aren’t you? I’ll give you an example, 
Kevin Acres. I don’t know how well you know Kevin. 
NG: I know him  quite well, he’s on the board. 
VC: You know he was trained as a phys ed teacher; he doesn’t have an agricultural background. He grew 
up on a family farm but… 
AG: He was out of a family of ten. 
NG: He’s also said to my father, I’ve heard him say it myself, that “I never was going to be a farmer, but 
where can I own my own business and realize the equity growth that we can?” If done right, I mean we 
own equity that reproduces, think about that!  
VC: Sure, sure. 
NG: Which it also comes back to taking good care of your animals. For me personally, I could have gone 
to college for four years anywhere I wanted. 
[0:55:12 - 0:55:38 interruption; recording paused.] 
0:55:38 
AG: …cell phones. Because they can call from the fields and the service truck can go to the field instead 
of hauling that big piece of equipment back here. 
NG: And also that’s part of the reason, for management, we can call and just keep everything moving so 
much faster. Technology has helped. I have a Smartphone, and we break so much stuff. You have this 
much equipment, and stuff breaks. And I’m in the field ordering parts, because it’s a natural human 
thing: if you break something you start tearing it apart because you know you have to fix it. But what 
good does it do to tear the broken one apart if you haven’t got the new part? So I get the part ordered 
before I do anything, because then I’ve got the next one coming. And that’s how I’ve got to think 
differently than the hired men. 
VC: Did you have 4-H or FFA or anything like that in your background? 
NG: Nope, not in my background at all.  
AG: Your father did though. I taught the 4-H groups, and he did demonstration days and all that sort of 
stuff. 
NG: I went to a parade when I was like 10 and I asked my father what FFA meant; I had never even 
heard of it. A lot of that is, again, with so few farmers out there now those kinds of things aren’t as 
prevalent. And things were a little different even when I was young. When we had 200 cows my father 
worked more hours, so I got home from school and I worked. 
AG: He always came down with his father. Now Andrew’s sons didn’t; his wife didn’t encourage the boys 
to come back here. 
VC: Do you have siblings? 
NG: I have two older sisters. 
VC: Either of them involved in agriculture in any way? 
AG: They were both dairy princesses. 
NG: They were both dairy princesses and they fed calves and did all that for quite a while, but they’ve 
moved on. But we did 4-H when we were real young, my mother did it, but see we did it when they 
were young and I was even younger, so not even old enough to really care. And then I think that group 
kind of fizzled out and by the time I was in high school when a lot of people are active in FFA, I was just 
working. 
VC: So you were learning— 
NG: I was hands-on! Because we’ve always had enough going on that… 
0:58:16 
VC: Well you are an impressive young man I must say. 
AG: Thank you, he is! He’s an awful good young man. 
VC: At 23, to have gotten all that knowledge together and kept it together…I’m impressed. 
AG: I think farms raise good kids myself. 
VC: They do. And farming communities generally do. 
AG: Yes they do. And you know I have to give credit to the daughter-in-laws because it takes a special 
kind of wife to be able to fit in and have her plans change when something comes up. This is your 
income. 
NG: I tell people it’s a lifestyle and not a job. And even like my younger cousin from my mother’s side of 
the family who didn’t grow up on a farm, he lives with me now. First he started just hanging around, and 
I tell everybody “If you’re gonna be friends with me you better like work!” Anyone that comes around 
me I end up putting to work because I’ve got more than I can do! 
AG: But you know he’s been happy to have a job here too because there aren’t many jobs where you 
can take that kind of money home. 
VC: To me interesting questions keep cropping up! So a kid on a farm has to learn lots of different 
things. 
NG: Oh that’s what I love! And especially a bigger farm; I’ve gotten to do so many things. And you can 
also try things. I’ve only been home for two years and in my position I don’t take a regular job. For 
instance I don’t go mow hay because then I’m stuck in a cab for the whole day. I basically bounce around 
and do a lot of odd jobs that I don’t want to send a hired man to do. I installed the used oil burner, so I 
wired it up – 
AG: You learned all that welding type of stuff from your father. 
NG: On and off. 
AG: He’s a good welder, isn’t he? 
NG: Dad? Yeah he’s a good welder. But believe it or not the other thing that I truly enjoy about life is my 
father’s always been busy keeping everybody moving; he’s the boss. I’ve had the opportunity growing 
up here to work with a lot of older people…you know my other grandfather would come down and do 
other projects for us, and he’d bash ‘em. He used to run part of the utility down to Clarkson; he had like 
five men working for him year-round, ran the maintenance division. He knows so many things and I got 
to work with those types of people as I was even younger than I am now, and you learn a lot. Andy’s a 
better electrician than Dad by far, so if I have an electrician problem I call him. But I try everything. 
VC: Yeah, I was going to say on a small farm you have little or no help and you have to do everything, but 
even here you’ve got to be able to know. 
AG: But Varick, it doesn’t hurt young people to work. They’ve got too much time on their hands, too 
many electronic toys, no responsibility. 
NG: You know, it’s funny for me because I’ve never really had any friends that were involved in ag, 
because no one else at Parishville was a farmer. So going to college was a really fun experience because 
you meet all these people your own age who have grown up on farms, and you can tell the difference. 
They know a lot about things I don’t even know at all, about milking systems and vacuum pumps. They 
tinker with them and stuff, whereas our parlor is a huge computer. You push a button and if it doesn’t 
work, then you’re in trouble! But I’ve learned a lot about all that kind of stuff and now farms are getting 
very integrated. We have temperature sensing fans and curtains, and I know farms with computers on 
everything. Everything’s become more complicated and you learn with everything you do. 
VC: So the ordinary help have to have some skills. 
NG: Oh, wicked. My friend put in 13 robots, the things will call you if they break down. Our grain dryer, 
my father knows a lot about that that he didn’t know. 
AG: But you know what I found sad about the employees is they’ve either been psychologically abused 
and it takes them a while to trust you, but they’re perfectly capable of learning when someone is patient 
with them. Now Andy is very, very patient, he’s taught them how to use the computers to check on herd 
health, because it comes right up on the computer if an animal’s sick. The production drops or they’ve 
got a fever. So that’s been an asset, too. 
NG: The other joy is –and I know Andy maybe wouldn’t say this—but Andy enjoys altering other people’s 
lives. He’ll try to rescue people, so to speak; you know, he’ll hire these people and sometimes they come 
with too much baggage, or drugs. 
VC: Even some of their families. 
NG: Yeah, and I’m just like “uhh…”—but you take these people and give them a job and we’ve got 
people up there that can barely read but yet they’re making 11 or 12 dollars an hour and taking home 
almost $1000 a week, but where else could they do that? And they’re happy. 
1:04:14 
VC: And one of the things I’ve heard which really distresses me as someone who grew up in Hopkinton is 
what seems to have happened to some of our community in the last number of years. I hear, and I don’t 
know this for a fact, that there these old houses that I knew of that are meth houses now. This stuff is 
going on, and it’s either because these people don’t see any opportunity to do anything, or it’s the easy 
way out, I can’t tell which. So if you find somebody who can be… 
AG: Rehabilitated 
VC: Yeah. That was one of the impressions I got from Andy is that he puts up with a lot. 
NG: And it doesn’t always work. Some of them you fire and you say that’s too bad, and it’s sad for him 
or I because you can look at them and you know they’re going to have a hard life. But if they won’t 
work… 
AG: Well, we had a man that had gotten dismissed and he wants to come back and the two Matthew 
boys got after Harold and told them that Andy isn’t going to hire them back. We tried before and he just 
isn’t a worker. 
VC: Well, listen, this has been terrific, and I thank you an awful lot. 
AG: I hope it’s been enlightening! 
VC: Oh, it has been; this whole project has been. I grew up here and I thought I knew some of this, but I 
didn’t know any of it! 
AG: But it’s changed a lot too. 
VC: That’s true. So I am going to turn this off. Unless did I not cover something that you thought of while 
we were talking that you just wanted to share? 
NG: I was saying that farmers are committed to the community, and I think that’s important.  
AG: And another thing I’d say is that it’s an asset to remain married for your life, if you want to maintain 
a farm; because there’s nothing that will destroy it quicker than a divorce. 
VC: I can imagine. 
AG: Because then you’ve got to divide it and it can ruin the whole thing. 
VC: When you look at it at that level it’s an asset because if it had to be split that would be really bad. I 
did think of one thing, Nick. You started before I turned this on to talk about having acquired all this 
land, and how people refer to the land in different ways, and that in fact it’s still referred to by--  
NG: Yeah, I mean the farms—the funny thing is everyone used to be a farm (sic), but now that the farms 
have expanded and grown, sometimes Dad and I sit back and it is amazing the farms that we now have 
encompassed into one conglomerate, so to speak. And we still call all of the fields by their names of who 
owned them before. And that for me is kind of fun ‘cause I like the history of an area; I like history in 
general. But it does keep alive a small part of it, just to refer to things that way. 
VC: So as long as the oral tradition keeps around, as long as people are going to refer to it as “the Miller 
place” or “the Jones place,” or whatever. When I was talking with Andy, I was saying that I was old 
enough to know Roger and Conrad Cook. And they had a farm up the road. 
AG: Oh yes. 
NG: Yes, well we use some of Conrad’s land. He owns it but we have an agreement with him, and we call 
it the Old Cook Farm, up on the hill where his father would’ve been. But then we say ‘Cooks’ which is 
over on the Old Potsdam-Parishville Road, several miles away. 
AG: And the Reuben Hill place on the Old Parishville Road. 
VC: You even go out into Hopkinton somewhere, don’t you? 
NG:  We used to own land out in Fort Jackson but we sold that. It was too far at the time. 
VC: Let Akins buy that! 
NG: Yeah well we own Bolds, Hubert Bolds. It was a beautiful woods. 
AG: But we’ve always put that money back in here. 
NG: Actually that’s the other thing, the land as equity is awesome but it’s very…it’s very, you know on 
liquid. Sometimes that’s the problem with farms; a lot of our assets are tied up in liquid assets. We’ve 
had times where we were able to cut the wood on a piece of land during a real poor stretch, and 
actually really, it was a big boost to cash flow. And that’s a nice thing to have. That’s one thing about 
having a bigger farm. 
AG: Well we bought their land over there and pretty much have paid for it with the wood that we’ve 
taken off. And mostly there wasn’t much tillable land there but the idea is not to have somebody over 
there; that was Don’s sister, see. But you don’t want somebody living across the road that might give 
you a lot of flack about trucks or smells or whatever. 
VC: Okay, well, terrific, so I’m going to just stop this. 
End- 1:09:42
