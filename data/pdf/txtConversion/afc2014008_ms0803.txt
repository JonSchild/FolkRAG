October 23,  1995
 
Dear Kate -
-
 or the  fundraisers  involved -
-
Kate,  I tried to telephone you about this but couldn't
 
discover where you might be and didn't know who was handling
 
the phone  in Tennessee,  so decided to write.  I received your
 
fund raising letter of October and I really didn't like it.
 
Since  I' m sure my reaction wasn't what you had in mind,  I
 
thought  I should try to explain,  mostly in case other people
 
might  feel some of the same ways and not tell you why.
 
In the first place,  you say "I realize you have not been
 
involved in Highlander's work".  That  simply isn't true;  I
 
have followed Highlander's history almost  since its
 
inception;  I knew Miles and Zilphia;  and I have made a number
 
of fiscal contributions over many years -
-
 not much,  but what
 
I could afford when I could afford it.  I also spent many many
 
hours on the phone trying to help Highlander understand what
 
kinds of projects the NEA Folk Arts Program could fund under
 
its guidelines,  and some of those proposals did indeed get
 
approved by various panels.  It's  important not to hurt
 
people's  feelings carelessly this way,  especially when you' re
 
asking them for money.  Somebody should have looked this up,
 
or  just not mentioned it.
 
I did stop making personal contributions during the era when
 
the Sapps were  in charge,  because  I thought the treatment of
 
the Carawans at that time and afterwards was  shabby.  Much
 
more to the point,  though,  I was then reading and have
 
continued to read incoming fiscal appeals carefully in order
 
to understand just what kind of a cultural program Highlander
 
supports.  Frankly,  it has  seemed to me minimal;  I have been
 
sorely disappointed.  And although I have read the current
 
letter twice through,  I still don't see any indication of
 
what  specific cultural ideas or plans are even in the works.
 
People want to contribute to something that's really going to
 
happen,  not  just to hear how great the program was during the
 
integration movement and the People's March on Washington.  I
 
was happy to receive a history of Highlander,  but  felt  it in
 
many ways  just  reinforced the idea that the Center is  living
 
still on past glories.
 
On the  same day  I was  struggling with your  letter,  another
 
arrived from Pete Seeger soliciting funds  for Sing Out.  At
 
risk of making you folks mad at me, I' ll enclose it.  It  seems
 
to me a good example of what could have been done had the
 
kind of planning they' ve been going through been accomplished
 
in the Center.  Can't you stop relying so much on your
 
exemplary history and tell me and other potential donors  just
 
what  is actually being done and just what is being planned?
 
Lastly,  to be a bit personal -
-
 others may not at all feel
 
this way,  I realize -
-
 I myself felt kind of bruised at
 
having my long affection for my old friend Ralph dragged into
 
a money-raising letter.  Ralph and I often discussed
 
Highlander and we sometimes disagreed about  it,  and I loved
 
him and I miss him.  I don't  like having my sentiments poked
 
at  for fund raising purposes.  If  I had thought the current
 
Highlander was doing a really great cultural  job,  I would
 
certainly have been supporting it whether Ralph had been on
 
the board or not.
 
Call it the Ralph Rinzler Cultural Endowment -
-
 that's  fine,
 
but  say specifically what  it's being set up for,  be a bit
 
more modest about how glorious Highlander has been in the
 
past,  and don't give the impression that Ralph's name is
 
being thrown around to raise a few bucks.  If he helped dream
 
up the idea of an endowment reserved for cultural activities
 
before his death and/or made some contribution,  that's all
 
you need to say.
 
I hope you will accept the  foregoing irritable remarks as
 
representing a serious attempt to be helpful.  I don't  like to
 
say unpleasant things,  and I really don't have time to write
 
such letters -
-
 as  I said,  I tried to talk it out  first -
-
but  I really want Highlander to be a great place with a great
 
program.  With that in mind,  I am enclosing a check,  to
 
represent both my brother Alan and myself.  He is back in
 
hospital  for some more therapy at the moment,  so do not
 
expect to hear from him directly for a while.
 
Yours ever,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Dear Egle:
 
Now "Taking a Breath"  is back over to you.  Frankly,  I was
 
surprised how well it all  read.  And although I approached my
 
task with a mental lecture on not doing any last-minute
 
editing unless  I just  couldn't  stand it,  I found myself quite
 
untempted until pages  8-9,  where  I have marked,  in the  right
 
hand margin,  a possible cut of four lovely paragraphs that
 
seem to me might well be Just Too Much.
 
That was  last night.  This morning they don't  look too
 
obtrusive and I have mentally put them back  in.  And then  I
 
tried it with them out.  And then with them in.  Please,  dear
 
Egle,  edit me;  I don' t really care which way.  Perhaps some
 
overall problem such as the number of pages  for the  issue
 
will dictate a decision -
-
 or you can tell me so.
 
Otherwise,  I have  indicated a few mis-prints along with
 
eliminating a few underlinings which looked a bit  silly in
 
print,  I thought.  Should any or all of the above be
 
indecipherable,  give me a call -
-
 703/243-2271,  and if  I am
 
not  home,  my little machine will  say I will  call  you back,
 
and  I will.  I wish you a happy Thanksgiving and good editing.

Dear Bess:
 
Enclosed is a copy of the galleys  (
!)  for your article for New York
 
Folklore.
 Please  review,  correct,  and  return  at  your  earliest
 
convenience.
 (
I am hoping to spend the long Thanksgiving weekend
 
working on the issue your article will be in,  so it would be good
 
to get  your corrections before  then.)
 I think  it's  easiest  for
 
everyone if you write right on the galleys, make one photocopy for
 
your files,  and send the original back to me.
 
There definitely is a light at the end of the tunnel now,  and I
' m
 
very excited about seeing the conference papers in print.
 
With every best wish,

 Att:  Linda
 
To the Search Committee Members:
 
I write in support of the candidacy of Daniel Sheehy for a
 
position as Dean at Humboldt State.  By way of personal
 
introduction,  I retired three years ago from a fifteen-year
 
position as Director of the Folk Arts Program at the National
 
Endowment  for the Arts,  a federal granting agency,  where  I
 
supervised a staff of  6-8 and allocated grants funds
 
totalling some  4 million dollars annually.  Before  joining the
 
Endowment,  I had for approximately eleven years taught  in the
 
Anthropology Department at California State University,
 
Northridge.
 
I have known Daniel  Sheehy during this entire period,  first
 
as  a part-time  faculty member at CSUN,  where he taught
 
ethnomusicology,  then as a field worker and presenter for the
 
1975 and 1976 Smithsonian  Institution's Festival of American
 
Folklife,  still  later as Assistant Director of the Folk Arts
 
Program where we worked side by side for fourteen years.  When
 
I retired from the Endowment,  Dan was  immediately promoted to
 
replace me as Director.  A better choice could not have been
 
made.
 
He  is a man of true quality -
-
 interesting and multi-layered.
 
In workaholic Washington,  while  functioning honorably and
 
effectively in the high-pressure atmosphere of a granting
 
agency,  he has consistenly kept up his  scholarly interests
 
and output as well as maintaining a presence as a working
 
musician.  His mariachi trumpet adds a frequent excitement to
 
government  receptions,  and he is about to complete his
 
editorship of the volume on Music in Latin America for the
 
forthcoming World Music Encyclopedia.  He maintains that his
 
attention to both scholarly research and musical performance
 
have helped keep him sane during the continuous upheavals of
 
political Washington,  and I suspect he  is right.
 
As Assistant Director of the Folk Arts Program,  one of his
 
responsibilities was personnel and the management of our
 
administrative budget;  he also compensated for my
 
mathmematicai deficiencies by gradually assuming most of the
 
nuts and bolts  side of our overall granting operation.  Beyond
 
these specific responsibilities,  90% of his work required
 
almost continual interaction with an enormous range of people
 
-
-
 potential grantees  from American Indian tribes  (or West
 
African immigrants or Southeast Asian refugees or innumerable
 
others)  who might never have considered applying for a grant
 
before;  tough-minded,  experienced Metropolitan Museum of Fine
 
Art or Carnegie Hall executives;  reporters  looking for
 
program information or a bit of scandal;  federal and state
 
auditors;  Congressmen;  and always and forever artists -
-
visual and musical -
-
 in need of care and information and
 
patient,  even-handed instruction.
 
He  is wonderful with them all.  His  superb command of the
 
Spanish language allows him to converse informally in several
 
regional dialects as well as to conduct official
 
correspondence  in Spanish where appropriate.  His  services as
 
interpreter are  requested throughout the agency.  He is an
 
invited speaker at college campuses,  media centers,  and arts
 
agencies across the country,  especially in his home state of
 
California where he has kept up his  friendships  in academia
 
and the arts.
 
I think Humboldt State would be lucky to entice Daniel Sheehy
 
to  join you.  He  is responsible,  hard-working,  well-informed,
 
and talented;  he understands and can articulate the problems
 
and advantages of multiculturalism as  few others do;  he is a
 
competent and experienced administrator.  Besides he has a
 
great  sense of fun,  and he  is a gentleman.  I am proud to be
 
his  friend.
 
If there are  specific questions on Daniel Sheehy that  I might
 
be able to answer,  I can be reached at the above address,  or
 
be phone at  703/243-2271 or by FAX at  703-528-1530.
 
Sincerely,

A very happy New Year to you!
 I missed seeing you at AFS, and
 
have been meaning to write ever since.  Today we are snowed in on
 
our little six acres of Kentucky, so it seems like just the time.
 
Nolan is settling into fulitime residence here pretty well, I
 
think, all things considered.
 It's a change for someone who has
 
has three decades of academic structure to his life, but he was
 
never as much in love with teaching as with writing, so in some
 
ways the freedom is welcome.
 
He remains in a fairly constant state of growlage at Illinois
 
Press -
-
 I
'm afraid his high point at AFS was roundly snubbing
 
poor Judy McCulloh, whom I
'm convinced is not wholly responsible
 
for the problems.  But he does seem to have captured their
 
attention, and they're off high center at last: the final version
 
of the copy-edited manuscript arrived a couple of days ago, and
 
they predict publication in the fall.  No one will be more
 
relieved than I.
 
Nolan's move here coincided with my tenure and promotion at
 
Western Kentucky.
 It was a great relief, but a poignant one: to
 
achieve for myself some measure of security in an academic
 
position at a time when so many folklorists I love and respect are
 
finding their work scanted and their livelihood threatened makes
 
me feel a bit quisling-ish.  Best I can do is teach hard and well,
 
and make my students see the light, keep the faith .
 .
 .
 also to
 
pay attention to folk arts in Kentucky, and get the university
 
into what gaps may occur in state programs.
 
You'll be glad to here that I
've been in regular touch with
 
Dorothy Lee, who is scheduled for ordination in June.  Now that
 
she is so close to her goal, her mood has lightened. She's had a
 
hard pull--her finances have been barely enough to see her through
 
this.  Most Episcopal seminarians have other resources to draw on;
 
she's had her savings from her salary at Indiana.
 
It was a heartbreaker, though not an unexpected one, to lose Gerry
 
Parsons last summer.  Oddly, the most comfort in that came from
 
John Jackson, the guitarist, who was playing in Tennessee last
 
spring.  He remembered me from my Washington days, and we had a
 
warm gossip about mutual friends, Gerry among them.  We shared
 
many memories, and it felt good.  It's a very unfashionable
 
sentiment, but an important part of my growing up in DC was
 
defined by the wisdom of older black people around me, most of
 
whom came from the Piedmont like John.  They were, of course,
 
workers in the home--mine and those of my friends.  But they were
 
also my teachers in a very special way.
 It was inexpressibly
 
heartening to share a simple sorrow over the sickness of a good
 
friend with him.
 
By the way, we too have shaken off that wretched Leadbelly fellow
 
Sean Killeen.  Neither of us subscribed to the newsletter, but
 
Nolan received copies on account of the JAL biography, and I did
 
at work, on account of editing Southern Folklore.  We were both
 
troubled by the Lonnie Dunegan piece--and on top of that, he had
 
the temerity to forward to Nolan your letter to him concerning it,
 
presumably looking for Nolan's sympathy.  Nolan shot back that he
 
could cross off both our names from his list, as well.
 
I
've been sorry to hear of Alan's health problems, and do hope
 
that things ease up on him in the coming year.
 I also hope that
 
you are flourishing, and that this letter will sit around a good
 
long while, awaiting your return from someplace lovely, warm,
 
sandy, and musical.
 
Please always remember, you're one of my heroes!
 
Affectionately,

Dear Ms.  Hawes:
 
March 21,  1995
 
Your
 brother,
 Alan,
 suggested
 I  write
 you
 about
 the
 
Anthropologists'  Fund for Urgent Anthropological Research that we
 
have established.
 
I have enclosed a pamphlet to describe the Fund.
 We are in
 
the process of enlarging our list of sponsors as well as attempting
 
to  build  an  endowment  of  $1,000,000  so  that  the  Fund  will  be
 
self-supporting.
 
Alan suggested that I write to you in this regard as you might
 
know of sources of funding for it.
 
I hope I am not intruding,  but I certainly would appreciate
 
any thoughts you might have soliciting funds for this project.
 
Sincerely yours,

The Social Se paration Syndrome
  
Introduction
  
The social separation syndrome consists of a set of symptoms
 
that appear in a population when it undergoes social change.
 These
 
consist of the increased incidence of behavioral, psychological, and
 
physiological im airrnents.
 When these reactions reach such a degree,
 
they become dysfunctional, or r
naladaptive, to the population at risk
 
and interfere with the processes of change themselves.
 Therefore,
 
the proper management of the social separation syndrome by those
 
involved in planning social change is critical to a population at
 
risk in order to minim± e health and behavioral imoairments and thus
 
facilitate those processes involved in the adaptation to char ge.
 
There are three aspects of this syndrome:
 (
1) psychosocial
 
deprivation and devaluation;  (
2) growing role conflict and a
±gu t
 
along with an increasing aspiration-achievement gap; and (
3) social
 
bereavement.
 
Psychosocial Deprivation and Devaluation
  
All individuals constantly scan their social environment to
 
determine how successful they are in coping with it and  :
here •
zhev
 
rank with others in their social fields.
 Self-esteem and the eval-
uaticn cf personal worth is the emotive su  ation of this scan.
 
This summation is constructed from, among other factors, the success
 
or failure in occupying roles and the degree of acce :ance or re ection
 
of one's social identity.
 
Yet one of the recurrent processes that occurs when an indigenous
 
population is confronted with development or modernization is the
 
lOSS  of self-esteem, the de?rivation of nersonal worth, and the
 
devaluation of social identity.
 
There are two causes for this in situations of social change.
 
First, there are the explicit evaluations made by members of th e
 
dominant culture or by development planners.
 The other is the
 
product of processes occurring in other aspects of the social
 
separation syndrome, i
.e.  social bereavement and the arc.
 t
-
 of role
 
conflict and ambiguity and an increased aspiration-achievement gaD.
 
Frequently, the members of a dominant culture will evaluate the
 
members of a srange culture as ignorant, dirt , stu id, backward,
 
naked, etc.
 Furthermore, chance agents may also belttio the memL
'e's
 
of a oo ulation a: risk and their sociocultural system in order to
 
achieve their change gca
 (
see
 ell 1975).
 Usually the very act
 
of development itself is ohrased in terms that imolicitiv,  if not
 
explicitly, devalue the culture of the indigenous  o u a:icn and its
 
members.
 For example. seldom ara  the tra itions and history of an
 
indigenous peo ple collocted ani preserved in situations cf social
 
-
 34  - 
change as normally occurs in developed countries through museums,
 
historical societies, and associations.
 
But without sufficient self-esteem and a positive evaluation
 
of personal worth, which must of necessity include one's own culture,
 
the members of a population at risk do not have the psychosocial
 
resources to cove with social change and to move into the future
 
constructively.
 Thus, this extrinsic evaluation becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy.
 
Role conflict and ambiguity also contribute to psychosocial
 
deprivation and devaluation.
 
Social change characteristically produces changes in roles,
 
which causes conflict and ambiguity in their performance.
 This
 
further erodes an individual's self-esteem and his social identity.
 
For social identity is constructed on ethnic and locational factors
 
in conjunct-ion with the combination of roles that a
:-.
:
 ays in the
 
kinship and occupational domains of a society.
 As locational or
 
ethnic identities are redefined in social change to be er
.com asse
 
in a larger national identity, so an individual's social identity
 
becomes ambiguous, ill-defined.
 Moreover, if locational or e:hnic
 
identities also carry connotations of inferiority, this not only
 
threatens a viable social identity but also se f-esteem.
 .
.nd  -
a'id
 
movement in :hs 0 00rtunitv structure, such as increased educati: -
opportunities, can also exacerbate the problem of establishing ar
.
 
acceptable and viable social identity.
 
Finally, the psychological loss that accompanies sod a:. chan
 
(
see below) also threatens one's social identity and self-esteem.
 
This form of psychosocial deprivation and devaluation has
 
health consecuences.
 Various researchers have reoorted osvchLatr c
 
disorders associated with disturbances of social identity (
see
 
A pell n
.d.).
 Also, the loss of self-esteem has been found to
 
produce behavioral impairments as well as to proceed the onset of
 
illness.
 The behavioral impairments can include millenarian movements
 
as well as political violence.
 
Role Conflict and Ambiguity and the As iratid —Achievement
  
Increased role conflict and ambiguity are a necessary concom-
itant of social change.
 New roles are introduced; old ones are
 
modified and redefined.
 And researchers have found an increase in
 
rates of psychological and physiological impairments associated
 
with an increase in role conflict and ambiguity.
 
A grow;
-n*
g
, -ap between aspirations and achievement is also a
 
commonplace occurrence in situations of social change.
 One scholar
 
has in fact ar gudd that development cannot take pl ace wirh ut
 
increasing a piro
.tions and that  i tr. ditionil  c
' i tv mu-
. t 1
.'
 
destroyed to allow this gap to grow.
 Yet other researchers  (
see
 
Appell n
.d.  for a review "
of the literature) have found  that an
 
-
 35 -  
increasing aspiration-achievement gap in a po ulation is also
 
associated with an increase in psychiatric disability.
 
Social Bereavement
  
Social change produces psychological loss, which, if not
 
managed properly, can rsult in various dysfunctional cor
n ensaticns.
 
This
 
sychological reaction that occurs in a populatior
. under oir
.:
 
change is similar to the grief experienced over the death.of a
 
significant other.
 As a consequence, I refer to this reaction
 
produced by social change as "social bereavement."
 
Bereavement appears to have a deve
pmental secuence.
 First.
 
there  s a period of denial or numbness, accompanied by feelings
 
of threat to one's identity.
 This is succeeded by a phase of
 
frustrated searching for the lost one, hoeing for a reversal, an t
.
 
then bitter pining and an unrelieved sense of pain.
 oiio in
 
this is a Period of de pressi on and apathy, inters ersed: ith
 
periods of anger against the deceased for having le :
 bereave .
 
This
 s the period when the bereaved gives u  hoce
 f rec v ring
 
the lost person or social world.
 Finally there is the phase of
 
reorgani:ation, when the bereaved begins to build new clans and
 
ass
= -_
ions about the world.
 This period is as: fra:
n: i
 
accor
. ar
.ied with guilt feelings associated with the ;roces  of
 
removing the deceased from one's social field.
 This transition
 
out of the grieving state can be accomplisned more succec fullv
 
when the bereaved links u  wi t
h his new life the :ast meanings c'
 
lire and the past purposes that were part or tne co mm--n  social
 
of the deceased and the living.
 
The developmental sequence of grieving can be ahcr:ed and the
 
process intarru ted if the process of grieving is not ccr letel\'
 
worked through.
 Certain  atholcgical manifestations cc:: then occ.r.
 
which may include unrelieved depression and apathy, health irn
ai r me n:
 
of various kinds and/or unexpected outbursts of aggression.
 
When a population as a result of social change undergoes ma cr
 
changes in its social s'
.ace, its  ccioeconomic str' cture. or its
 
assumptions about the world, it experiences t
.e same grieving process.
 
If the trauma of such losses are not successfully worked out and
 
healed, reintegration and growth in the population will cease.
 
Under these conditions populations can lose their caPacities to
 
cope, becoming a athetic. de ressed,, or, alternatively, angry.
 As
 
with individual grief, so with social bereavement, normal growth
 
and the completion of the developmental cycle of bereavement require
 
that the past be conceived of as a meaningful and an imcortant
 
experience on.which to build the future.
 If the oast is destroyed
 
without proper ,i
aluation, the normal oevelopmer
L
 cf the social
 
bereavement  rocess is aborted (cf. Apoell 1977).
 
Thus. it is important that a Dopulatlon h ve access  to  its
 
to  its  traditions,  to  i:s culture  in order to move  into the  furur .
 
-
 36 - 
The degree to which the psychological and physiological health
 
of a oopulation is im aired thrcu gh inap propriate social bereavement
 
is difficult to estimate as no controlled studies have been made of
 
this phenomenon.
 However, we can perhaps adumbrate the dimension s 
of the problem by indicating th e degree of health impairment that
 
accompanies personal bereavement, realizing that this may only give
 
us a poor analogue.
 Park es  (
1972) in rev
iew ing  the evidence available
 
finds that bereavement is associated with an increase in mortality
 
rates, especially from heart
 di sease
, an d w ith an increase in the
 
incidence of cervical cancer, psychological impairment, and general
 
health impairment.
 In one se ple, the mortality rate of widcwers
 
during the first six months of bereavement was found to be 40 per
 
cent higher than expected.
 Th e greatest proportional increase  ;
as
 
in the deaths from coronary thrombosis and other arteriosclerotic
 
and degenerative diseases, which was 67 per cent above ex ectar1on.
 
In another study mortality among relatives of the deceased during
 
the first year of bereavement was seven times higher than in
 tched
 
control group.
 
One of the characteristic responses to personal berea';ement
 
and, I would argue, also social bereavement, is a feeli'
.z cf
 
lessness.
 If this condition is not a transient res ponse 
-but
 
predominant method of cc ing with loss, there can -
h-
health implications.
 For exam le, there is evidence
 
ness can figure in the onset of cancer (
see  oel1 n
.d.  for a
 
of the literature).
 
Engel and his collaborators have been ccncerr
.ed
 
related question:
 Why do people fall ill or de at the time they
 
do?  And they have identified a psychological pattern that a
p p e a r s
 
associated with disease onset that they call the
 
up complex."
 Five characteristics are identified w
i t h
 this comole::
 
(:ngei 12E8):
 (1) the giving up affects, i
.e. hel plessness Cr
 
hopelessness;  (
2) a de preciated image of the self;  (
3) a loss of
 
gratification frcm relationships or roles in life:  () a disru tion
 
of the sense of continuity between past, present, and future; and
 
(
E) •
a react1va:1 n of memories of earlier oericds of z.vin  ut.
 
Again these characteristics are co
 f
l1y fcun  in social
 
bereavement acoomPanving Social change.
 
Conclusion:
 Managing the Social Separation Syndrome
  
There are indications that the social separation s
v n
r c
m e
 i
n
 
some form or other acccmpanies all social change.
 And with all
 
disorders there is always an accompanying res onse that attem :s
 
to lessen the.d a
nage and hea1.
 For example,  if social bereavement
 
is managed properly there is evidence that it can facilitate the
 
processes  of  social  chan;e.
 Th
 rob1em facing the soci
 scientist
 
is how to facilitate the innate healing process i

at risk and its social system.
 
-
 37 - 
I have argued (Appell 1
977, 1978) that ethnograohic research,
 
the development of museums, and the creation of archives that contain
 
the literature, song, dance and art of indigenous peooles provide a
 
useful. prophylaxis against many of the disorders associated with
 
social bereavement and psychosocial deprivation and devaluation.
 
They provide the opportunity whereby the population at risk can
 
evaluate their past positively and link up the past meanings of life,
 
past goals and purposes, with the evolving new life so that social
 
change can be accomplished more productively and creatively.

Our music was enthusiastically r
eceived by t
he t
housands o
f t
ourists who came t
o D. C
. f
or
 
t
his 9
th Annual Folklife Festival.  Many sat i
n t

ears i
n t
heir eves as our songs
 
t
ouched t
heir hearts.  We heard s
o many co m ments, asking "Where are you f

 "
I' ye n
ever
 
h
eard such beautiful music before." -
 "You not only s

 \

ook l
ike angels." The
 
Washington Post, July 5
, 1
975 s
tated "
.
.
 .  The Molokans, a
 Russian Protestant sect, are a
 surprise
 
t
o even so me o
f t
he Californians present. ..
"
 Many asked where t
hey could buy t
apes or r
ecords o
f
 
our music.  Of course, we made none available as we d
id not want our songs co m mercialized.
 
Our group l
ooked beautiful -
 our outfits and shirts i
dentified us as Russian Molokans a
nd
 
a
ttracted everyone.  We s
tood out as a
 c
lean, wholeso me group.  So many were surprised t
hat we
 
a
lways dress f
or our church f
unctions i

his t

preachers wore -
 i

ifferent -
 and were surprised t
hat t
hey dressed l
ike everyone
 
e

 t
hat no one i

ifferent i

he f
act t
hat we have no
 
written music -
 t
hat our melodies are handed down f
ro m generation t

The S

tood up on s

would co m ment briefly on t

their name i

 and t

with such beauty and such f

 and i

Dear Ms.  Hawes,
 
Welcome to Friends of the Folklife Festival.
 On behalf
 
of the Center for Folklife Programs and Cultural Studies and
 
the Smithsonian Institution,  we are pleased to have you with
 
US.
 Your moral and financial  support of $500.00 will be of
 
great  assistance  in  preserving  and  presenting  traditional
 
cultures at the annual Festival of American Folklife.
 
In the near future,  when plans for this year's Festival
 
have been completed,  you will  receive your membership card.
 
As you have indicated on your membership application that you
 
wish to pick-up your membership gifts at the Festival, we will
 
expect  to  see you at  the  Friends  tent during the  Festival.
 
Our  tent  will  probably  be  close  to  the  National  Museum  of
 
American History.
 
We look forward to seeing you at the memorial concert for
 
Ralph on July 2nd.
 
Again,
 our  sincerest  thanks
 for  your  interest  and
 
involvement as a member and along with your support of CFP&CS.
 
Welcome.

Dear Bess:
 
F A X
 ( 3 3 4 )  26 9 - 9 0 9 s
 
April 14,  1995
 
Enclosed is a dub of the "In the Spirit" CD recording.
 This
 
is  a dub  of  a dub,  so  the  quality  is  not  the  same  as  the  real
 
thing.
 I've also enclosed the CD notes.
 There are fairly brief
 
(the book itself serves as the more extensive notes).
 
I'd recommend that you listen with the volume turned up.
 I
 
think  the  congregational  singing  and  Sacred  Harp  singing,  in
 
particular,  demand higher volume  -
-
 musics  that  are meant  to be
 
sung robustly and heard loudly.
 
A few additional comments on the selections:
 
1-2.
 Fine examples of why Sand Mountain in north
 
Alabama can lay claim to the finest Sacred
 
Harp singers in the world.
 
3.
 Good "old-style" gospel bluegrass featuring
 
the husky resonant female alto of Margie Sullivan.
 
4-:.
 O
rL d e
r f
U I ,
 sweet c orru.t o n - m e t e r  psalmody.
 In a new
 
twist of history this is an African-American
 
congregation maintaining a Scottish tradition
 
dating to the sixteenth century.
 
6.
 This powerful  "Dr. Watts" singing can be heard
 
at churches throughout South Alabama.
 
7.
 Not real good recording quality (this was John
 
Work's first field recording,  in 1938),  but does
 
give an idea of the robustness of black Sacred
 
Harp when the tradition was in its prime.

 This a cappella male duet is one of the real
 
jewels on this CD,  run into,  by chance,  at a
 
Christian Harmony family reunion this past
 
October.
 
9.
 My shape-note preference is 4-shape Sacred Harp,
 
but this sample shows a strong 7-shape Christian
 
Harmony tradition.
 
10.
 More powerful  "Dr.  Watts."
 
11.
 A rare find  (Drought to us by Charles Wolfe)
 
of Alabama's Delmore Brothers, with Grandpa
 
Jones in 1942.
 Song was written by Alton Delmore
 
(with his mother) when he was 17,  and published by
 
the Athens  (AL) Music Company,  and important "new
 
book" gospel publisher in the 1920s.
 A fine example
 
of southern gospel in its purer form.
 
12.
 These "new book" gospel singing conventions are
 
in counties all over Alabama typically meeting
 
on Sunday evenings at community centers.
 Again,
 
the louder the better.
 These folks don't mess
 
around when it comes to singing.
 
13.
 A never-released LC recording from 1941,
 
recorded at a union meeting.
 Speaks for
 
itself in terms of the Birmingham Quartet
 
Sound.
 Jobie Thomas, who sings on this
 
recording,  is still a healthy,  active
 
singer with the Shelby County Big Four.
 
14.
 This moaning is typically interspersed with
 
"Dr. Watts" singing during devotional at
 
black primitive Baptist churches.
 If
 
moaning doesn't get God's attention,  I don't
 
know what can.
 
15.
 The most contemporary piece on the CD.
 Jerry
 
and Tammy Sullivan are the legacy of the more
 
traditional bluegrass gospel Sullivan Family.
 
Like her aunt Margie Sullivan,  Tammy Sullivan
 
isn't afraid to "belt out" a song in her
 
wonderfully strong voice.
 I think that
 
"belting out" is characteristic of all those
 
Petecostal Holiness folks.

I think this is a rather nice contemporary
 
country gospel sound,  especially when compared
 
to that rather dreadful  "contemporary Christian"
 
which seems to dominate the white gospel radio
 
airwaves these days.
 
I
'd  much  appreciate  any  comments  you  may  have.
 Happy
 
listening!
 
All best,

Mrs.  Bess Lomax Hawes

Apt.  410
 
Arlington,  Virginia 22203
 
Dear Mrs.  Hawes:
 
I hope that by receiving the enclosed stand,  rosette
 
and  lapel  medal,  you  will  know  of  our  continued  great
 
admiration of your and contributions to the arts.
 
I personally enjoyed very much my association with you
 
and want to tell you why this is arriving a bit late albeit
 
with affection.
 
The date of the 1993 medal awards was set late and the
 
sculptor,  Robert Graham,  had only enough time to cast the
 
large  medal.
 He  got  caught  up with numerous  commitments
 
and then it was time for him to do the 1994 medals.
 He has
 
now completed your decorations and we are all happy that we
 
can send them to you.
 
Please call me if I can ever be of any service to you
 
here at the Endowment.
 
Sincerely,
 
Rcsemary C 4bben
