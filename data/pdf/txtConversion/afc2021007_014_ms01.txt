25 years as skiff man, making first set.  Early seining, not hatcheries.  Silver Bay, 
early chum hatchery release. 7 years no seining on outer coast, logging impacts 
salmon.  Chum hatcheries save seine fleet, making up for decline in wlld stocks.

Less salmon when they are eating squid instead of herring.  Climate Change, 
change in currents, Cape Edgecomb Flood up the coast for multiple days, and 
multiple ebb days peak current speed doubles.  More and stronger storms, 
greater wind speeds.  Fishing in all weather, less boats.  Fishing with dad
