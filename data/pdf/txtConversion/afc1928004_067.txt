)1endid Story of the Hills, by a 
favorite writer, viz.: 
A ellOICE coLLEcTioN OP 
Old Lute Cook, a 
denizen of the hills, meets with a 
young miner at a 
moment of extraordinary danger, and thereafter they become friends— 
such friends as let out life-blood in each other's defense. 
The young miner :Inds strange companionship in the fastnesses of the 
lulls, where rich " diggings" lure him—as strange, in fact, as the most 
novel circumstances could produce. In one of these characters he finds 
his destiny. 
The terrible experiences of the " rough and tumble" life of miners, 
deeply interesting as it is, is exceeded in interest by the danger and ex. 
eitement springing out of contact with desperadoes and savages, in which 
Qld Lute shows his head, hand and heart in a 
truly pioneer style,

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 
OF 
ARCIW HUGH 
"To be merry best becomes you; for, out of question, 
You were born in a 
merry hour."—.31uch Ado About Nothing. 
AMONG the many excellent Negro delineators, none rank higher or 
occupy a 
more prominent position in his profession than the subject 
of this sketch, and by his associates in the business he is universally 
acknowledged to have those innate qualities, the tact and intuitive 
perception of humor, so requisite in his calling. 
Archy Hughes 
was born in the city of Albany, N. Y., April 3d, 1833. 
In 1842, when 
only nine years old, he was thrown on his own resources to gain a 
livelihood. He came to the city of Brooklyn ( now his adopted home) 
and procured a 
situation in the " South Brooklyn Glass Works." 
After working here five years he went to Philadelphia and worked at 
his trade three years. 
During this time Archy had learned the rudi-
ments of his future profession, by having joined an amateur minstrel 
party, which, by permission, was allowed to show in the dining-room 
of a 
hotel. 
Arehy is the only one of this party who adopted the 
business as a 
profession. 
The next year (in 1850), Archy, then seven-
teen years old, with a 
minstrel party, joined Rivers and Derious' 
Circus Company. After staying the season, he, in company with Herr 
Trexler, " the strong man and contortionist," took a 
tour through the 
State of Pennsylvania. This party made up in talent what they lacked 
in numbers, as they only consisted of four— Herr Trexler, Archy, 
tambourine and fiddle. 
On his return from this _tone, Archy joined 
Thomas' Concert Saloon party, on Arch street, Philadelphia, for the 
winter season. 
The next year he joined Levi North's circus, at 
Chicago. On his return to Philadelphia he was engaged and stayed 
two years with the veteran minstrel, Samuel S. Sandford, at his opera 
house on Eleventh street, and went with the troupe on their South-
ern tour. 
On his return he joined Sam Sharpley's Minstrels. 
The 
next season, with Bob Edwards, he organized the " Edwards and 
Hughes' Minstrels," and traveled through New Jersey and Penn-
sylvania. While on this tour he left his party to join the Mrs. " Matt 
Peel" (Campbell) Minstrels. 
It has often been remarked that not 
6 
BIOGRAPHICAL SEETCH OF ARCHY HUGHES. 
only in size and voice, but eccentric movements, no one in the pro-
fession so closely resembles the lamented " Matt Peel" as Archy 
Hughes. 
He traveled this season throughout Canada with this 
party. 
The next season he joined Robinson and Toole's Circus. 
The next year he joined Corncross and Dixey's company, formerly 
Sandford's, and remained with them till 1E62, when be was borrowed 
from them by Mr. Richard M. Hooky, one of the best and the most 
successful managers in the profession, who had taken possession of 
the hall corner of Remsen and Court streets, in Brooklyn, and, not-
withstanding nearly all of the prominent minstrel managers had tried 
the experiment to establish a 
permanent minstrel ball in that city, 
and failed, Hooky has, by energy and perseverance, succeeded in 
establishing a 
first-class hall and company for the Brooklynites, 
and has also earned for his reward, a 
princely fortune, he being 
numbered among the Brooklyn millionaires. 
Archy was on the 
tambourine end when the band organized, and is now the only one 
—with the exception of Mr. HooleY—left of the original party. For 
seven years, with a 
month or two for recreation, has Archy been at 
his post, and, beyond doubt, is the acknowledged Brooklyn favorite. 
In his songs and dances, he never misses his encores; in his Irish 
songs, he has no superior; in pantomimes, which are often pro-
duced by Mr. Hooley, Archy has been the harlequin, his quickness, 
combined with graceful movements, has stamped him as one of the 
best now upon the stage. 
We will now conclude our brief sketch, 
by saying that in private life, Archy Hughes is endeared to a 
large 
circle of friends by the possession of those amiable qualities which 
never fail to command respect and affection. 
In spite of the exact-
ing character of his professional duties, he always finds time to an-
swer the calls of friendship, and to delight the social circle with his 
'wit, humor and gayety.

George, the Charmer. 
AS SUNG BY ARCHY HUGHES, OF HOOLEY'S MINSTRELS. 
As I 
was walking down the street, 
Oh, down the street, oh, down the street, 
A pretty girl I 
chanced to meet, 
She was a 
charmer, oh I 
I 
asked her for to take a 
walk, 
To take a 
walk, to take a 
walk, 
And then we had some berry nice talk, 
She was a 
charmer, oh ! 
Spoken: Yes, she was beautiful as she was fair, with pretty red 
eyes and nice curly hair, and I 
said to her, " If you love me as I 
love you, no knife shall cut our love in two—dollars and twenty-
five cents worth of oysters." Sez she, " Who are you?" Sez I, 
" 
Don't you know me? Why I'm

From Washington town to Baltimore, 
There's none like George, the charmer, oh l" 
Sez she, " Now George, you look so sweet, 
Look so sweet, look so sweet," 
Sez she to me, " Ain't you going to treat, 
I, Sally, the charmer, oh?" 
It's then I 
took her across the strdet, 
Across the street, across the street, 
This pretty girl I 
then did treat, 
For she was a 
charmer, oh 
Spoken: Yes, I 
took her down to a 
nice cream saloon. I 
treated 
her to every thing. Oh! you ought to have seen her eat. She eat 
eggshell pudding, nutmeg pies, beefsteak, mutton chops. Then 
the ramrod came in and wanted to know who was going to pay for 
it. " Why," sez she, " I 
ain't." " Then who is?" sez he. " Why," 
sez she, " it's—

The Velocipede. 
AS raxG BY ARM Y HUGHES, OF HOOLEY'S NUNTITIMIA. 
AIR: Paddle your own Canoe. 
I'm Freddy Sykes, of Clinton street, 
Oh, how do you like my style ? 
I've plenty of stamps for to sling about, 
For my governor has struck fie. 
No more I'll waste my time at school 
Of learning I 
have no need; 
I 
only desire to be a 
swell, 
And ride a 
velocipede. 
CHOP.US. 
Velocipedes are all the rage, 
They're beautiful things for speed; 
A whoop! hurrah! and away we go, 
Upon a 
velocipede ! 
2Iy beautiful new velocipede 
Is painted red and green, 
And when I 
come out the ladies shout, 
" 
Was the like of it ever seen ?" 
When I 
wave my hat, and through the etowd 
My flight none can impede, 
While the darling girls, enraptured cry, 
" 
What a 
sweet velocipede 1" 
(CHORUS.) 
One day I 
went to Prospect Park, 
To try my new machine, 
And who should I 
meet upon the drive 
But Roxiana Green! 
Says she, " Dear Fred, what is't you ride 
At such a 'two-forty speed r 
And as I 
threw a 
kiss I 
cried, 
" 
A two-wheeled velocipede!" 
Now, all young sports with stamps 
Come, take this free advice--
Go buy yourselves a 
velocipede, 
And don't stand upon the price; 
(CHoRus.) 
to spare, 
GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
It isn't hard to learn to ride, 
And when you once succeed, 
We'll go and teach the Brooklyn girls 
To ride the velocipede. 
Captain Jinks. 
(Cnonus.) 
AS 
SUNG BY WILLIAM HORACE LINGAR.D. 
I 
am Captain Jinks, of the Horse Marines, 
I 
often live beyond my means, 
I 
sport young ladies in their ' teens, 
To cut a 
swell in the army. 
I 
teach the ladies how to dance, 
How to dance, how to dance, 
I 
teach the ladies how to dance, 
For I'm their pet in the army. 
Spoken: Ha ha I 
eh: 
Cnonus—I'm Captain Jinks, of the Horse Marines, 
I 
give my horse good corn and beans, 
Of course it's quite beyond my means, 
Though a 
captain in the army. 
I 
joined my corps when twenty-one, 
Of course I 
thought it capital fun, 
When the enemy came, then off I 
run, 
I 
wasn't cut out for the army. 
When I 
left Itome mamma she cried, 
Mamma she cried, mamma she cried, 
When I 
left home mamma she cried, 
" 
He ain't cut out for the army." 
Spoken: No, she thought I 
was too young; but theh I 
said, ah, mamma, 
(Caonus.) 
The first day I 
went out to drill, 
The bugle-sound made me quite ill, 
At the balance step my hat it fell, 
And that wouldn't do for the army. 
The officers they all did shout, 
They all cried out, they all did shout, 
The officers they all did shout, 
" 
Oh, that's the curse of the army." 
Spoken: Of course my hat did fall off, but, all 
nevertheless, (Cnontfe.)

GEORGE TIIE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
My tailor's bills came in so fast, 
Force11 me one day to leave at last, 
And ladies, too, no more did cast 
Sheep's eyes at me in the army. 
My creditors at me did shout, 
At me did shout, at me did shout, 
My creditors at me did shout, 
" 
Why, kick him out of the army 1" 
Spoken: I 
said, " 
gentlemen, ah I 
kick me out of the army? Per-

Combination Song. 
Banjo Solo. 
AS SUNG EY J. K. CAMPBELL,. OF ROOLEYIS MINSTRELS. 
Come, listen to my list of songs, 
That I'm a-going to sing ; 
I'll try my best to please • ott, 
And I 
think they're just the thing ; 
If you'll take down my catalogue, 
And of those songs take heed, 
Of what I 
sing, you will perceive 
how curious they read. 
A frog he would a-wooing go, 
With his hair curled up to kill ; 
He used to wear an old gray coat, 
And the sword of Bunker Hill. 
An old crow sat on a 
hickory limb, 
None knew him but to save ; 
Let me kiss him for his mother, 
For he smells of Schweizerkase. 
Oh, Mary had a 
little lamb, 
He could a 
tail unfold; 
He had no teeth to eat the hoe-cake, 
At least so I've been told ; 
The boy stood on the burning deck, 
With his baggage checked for Troy--
One of the few immortal ones, 
His name was Pat Malloy. 
GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
Squinty Dan. 
Banjo Solo. 
SUNG BY S. K. CAMPBELL, OF HOOLEY'S MINSTRELS. 
I'll tell you of a 
nice young man, 
And of a 
maiden gal, 
The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she Long-legged Sall; 
They lived down on Center street, 
And loved each other well, 
And it's of a 
dismal historic 
That now I'm going to tell. 
Now Squinty Dan he had red hair, 
And looked two ways for Monday, 
He peddled clams around the street 
On every day but Sunday ; 
But Sundays Squinty Dan would go 
To court Long-legged Sall, 
And take her to ride in his clam barouche 
On the banks of Gowanus canal. 
He used to feed her on clam soup, 
Clam chowder and clam pie, 
And send her lots of long-necked clams, 
For her to roast and fry ; 
Till the neighbors' gals, through jealousy, 
Made up a 
horrid plan, 
To freeze the love in the bosom of 
Her darling Squinty Dan. 
When Squinty Dan heard the news, 
He climbed to a 
chimney top, 
He pulled a 
pound of powder out, 
And down he let it drop; 
It flashed up with a 
fearful roar, 
And blowed him so far on high, 
He never came down, and that is the last 
Of this mournful bus-to-ne.

Tommy Dodd. 
A POPULAR COMIC SONG. 
I 
lead a 
somewhat easy life, 
Like most men about town, 
But still I 
must submit to you, 
I'm somewhat of renown ; 
A speculative turn of mind, 
It may seem rather odd, 
I 
have a 
weakness, and it is 
A love for " Tommy Dodd 1" 
CHORUS. 
I'm always safe when I 
begin, 
Tommy Dodd, Tommy Dodd I 
Glasses round, cigars as well, 
Tommy Dodd, Tommy Dodd 
Now, my boys, let's all go in, 
Tommy Dodd, Tommy Dodd, 
Head or tail I'm safe to win, 
hurrah for Tommy Dodd! 
In town now if you meet a 
friend, 
You can not let him pass, 
Of course you must do something, 
You then propose a 
glass ; 
Now if I 
meet a 
chum or two, 
I 
nail them with a 
nod, 
Propose for each " a 
full-
grown dose," 
But submitting " Tommy Dodd!" 
(Cnonrs.) 
You have no idea the run of luck, 
-Which you have found the rule, 
Attends you if you go in " hot," 
Of course remaining " cool ;" 
A purse is just in case of need, 
For you can ride rough-
shod, 
And live like any fighting-
cock, 
If you're " up" in Tommy Dodd I (CHORUS.) 
A 
friend of mine three daughters had, 
He asked me home to tea, 
GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
13 
I 
played and sung, when by and by 
They all " spooned" on to me; 
I 
could not court the lot, you know, 
For that would seem so odd, 
So I 
proposed that they'd decide 
By way of " Tommy Dodd!" 
Susie Brown. 
WRITTEN BY M. B. LEKVITT- -SUNG BY ROOLEY'S MINSTRELS. 
There used to live in Boston town, 
A. pretty girl named Susie Brown, 
She took the shine of all around, 
My own sweet Susie Brown ; 
And now that she has left my sight, 
I 
mourn for her both day and night, 
I 
can not rest nor lay me down, 
But weep for Susie Brown. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my Susie Brown, 
The prettiest gal for miles around, 
Oh, my Susie Brown, 
The prettiest gal in town. 
I 
met my Susie Brown one night, 
As I 
walked out to see the sights, 
She looked so nice, so handsome too, 
My own sweet Susie Brown. 
I 
next did take her on a 
spree, 
To ask her if she'd marry me, 
And on her lips the word was, " Yes," 
But then she muttered, " No (Crtonus.) 
I 
then did take her to the ball, 
To see the fashions in the hall, 
The boys they had an eye on her, 
At my sweet Susie Brown. 
The watchmen they did make a 
rush, 
Because the boys commenced a 
muss, 
You'd ought to heard the prompter'call, 
As we both left the hall. (Cnourrs.)

Champagne Charlie. 
A POPULAR SONG. 
rVe seen a 
deal of gayety, 
Throughout my noisy Ii t3, 
With all my grand accomplishments, 
I 
ne'er could get a 
wife ; 
The thing I 
most excel in 
Is the P. R. F. G. game, 
A noise all night, in bed all day, 
And swimming in champagne. 
CHORUS. 
For Champagne Charlie is my name, 
Champagne Charlie is my name, 
Good for any game at night, my boys, 
Good for any game af, night, my boys, 
Who'll come and join me in a 
spree? 
The way I 
gained my title is 
By a 
hobby which I've got, 
Of never letting others pay, 
However long the shot; 
Whoever drinks at my expense 
Are treated all the same, 
From dukes and lords to cabmen down, 
I 
make them drink champagne. 
(CHORUS.) 
From coffee and from supper-room, 
From Poplar to Pall Mall, 
The girls, on seeing me, exclaim, 
"Oh ! what a 
champagne swell l" 
The notion ' tis of every one, 
If it were not for my name, 
And causing so much to be drank, 
They would never make champagne. (Cm.) 
Perhaps you fancy what I 
say 
Is nothing else but chaff, 
And only is, like other songs, 
To merely raise a 
laugh;

WRITTEN BY 31. B. LEAVITT—SUNG BY HOOLEY'S MINSTRELS. 
I'm leaning now with §adness 
Upon the cottage gate, 
Where we our fleeting moments 
Passed until the hours of late; 
There oft we sat and chatted, 
On earth none blithe as we, 
And as I 
gate into the clouds, 
Her sweet face there I 
see. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet and blissful be thy rest, 
My little angel, Rose; 
My weary heart with patience waits 
To join thee in repose. 
I 
placed her little hand in mine, 
Then smilingly she said, 
" 
The angels wait for me above," 
And then her spirit fled ; • 
Since then the world is dreary, 
Oh, how I 
long to dwell 
In heaven with that bright angel, 
My little Rosa Bell. 
In yonder little churchyard, 
Upon her grassy mound, 
I 
sit, with flowers of sweetness 
To pass my hours alone. 
Alasl she sleeps in silence, 
Beside the village dell, 
And I 
shall ne'er again behold 
My little Rosa Bell.

Statues. 
AS SUNG AND REPRESENTED BY W. H. LINGARD. 
Permit me here to represent 
Some great and noble men ; 
My photographic studio 
I 
trust may pleasure give, 
For ever in our memory 
These noted men all live. 
First the Corsican brothers, 
As on the stage they boast; 
There is a 
very cutting scene between 
Fabian and the ghost; 
When FaLian sees his brother's ghost, 
It fills his breast with woe ; 
And when he goes to seal the letter, 
I 
think, he stood just so. 
A statue now I'll show you, 
Beloved by every one, 
The father of the nation, 
The great George Washington; 
May many follow in his path, 
And to their country prove no foe, 
So hail Columbia's warrior, 
As I 
represent him so. 
Now we have Governor Hoffman, 
Who has done all he can 
To stop the great excise law, 
And aid the working man; 
He's an able politician, 
And has gained himself applause, 
So I 
think now here you'll give a 
cheer 
For Hoffman and his cause. 
Then there's General U. S. Grant, 
As I'm about to show, 
Who led his troops to glory, 
And struck terror to the -foe ;

GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
If any foreign enemy 
His trumpet dares to blow, 
We'll find him once more in the front, 
Standing, I 
think, just so. 
Now, with your kind permission, 
I'll introduce to you, 
The chief man of the nation, 
Andrew Johnson, good and true; 
Many have fought hard against him, 
But he says it's all no go, 
And when he faced his enemy, 
He stood, I 
think, just so.

Limerick Races. 
AS SUNG BY ARCHY HUGHES, OF HOOLEY'S MINSTREL, 
I'm a 
simple Irish lad, 
I've resolved to see some fun, sirs; 
So, to satisfy my mind, 
Up to Limerick town I 
come, sirs; 
Och, murther, what a 
place, 
• And what a 
charming city, 
Where the boys are all so free, 
And the girls are all so witty 1 
CHORUS.

It was on the first' of May 
When I 
began my rambles, 
When every thing was there, 
Both jaunting-cars and gambols; 
I 
looked along the road— 
It was lined with smiling faces, 
All jogging off, ding dong, 
To go to the Limerick races. 
(CID:ma) 
So then I 
was resolved 
To go and see the race, sirs, 
And on a 
coach-and- four 
I 
neatly took my place, sirs; 
When a 
chap bawls out, " Behind 1"— 
The driver dealt a 
crack, sir, - 
Faith, he struck me just as fair 
As if his eyes were in his back, sir 1 (Cm.) 
So, then, I 
had to walk, 
And to make no great delay, sirs, 
I 
arrived upon the course, 
Where every thing was gay, sirs; 
I 
spied a 
wooden house, 
And in the upper story 
Oh, a 
band struck up a 
tune 
Called " Garry Owen and Glory." (ClioRUs.) 
GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER.

There was fiddlers playing jigs, 
There was lads and lasses dancing, 
And chaps upon their nags 
All around the course was prancing; 
Sonic were drinking whisky punch, 
And others singing gayly— 
" 
Ah, give me the shamrock green, 
And the splinter of shillalah 
(CHORUS.) 
There was betting to and fro, 
To see who'd win the race, sirs 
One of the knowing coves 
Then came up to my face, sirs; 
Says he, " I'll bet you fifty pounds, 
And I'll leave it down this minute 1"— 
" 
Oh, then, ten to one," says I, 
" 
That the foremost horse will win it 1" (Cno.) 
When the actors came to town, 
What a 
merry lot were they, sir 1 
I 
paid my two-thirteens, 
To go and see the play, sir 
They acted kings and queens, 
Both Columbine and fairy, 
But I 
leaped upon the stage 
When they struck up Paddy Carey 1

I'll Surely Call Da-da. 
AS SUNG BY BILLY RICE, OF BOOLEY'S MINSTRELS. 
I'm going to tell of a 
gay young gal, 
A charming belle, as sweet as muscatel ; 
She'd a 
fair, fair skin, and her father was in 
The city militia. 
I 
called on her papa one day, 
Something important I'd to say, 
But his daughter said he was away, 
So I 
couldn't see her da-da. 
CHORUS—Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da, da. 
Now I 
blushed to the nose when I 
saw sweet Rose, 
For I 
often lacked the courage to propose ;. 
* 2J 
GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
Not knowing what to say, I 
invited her to play 
A tune from some opera. 
I 
placed my arm around her waist, 
And longed those pouting lips to taste 
But she said I'd better retire in haste, 
Or she'd call her da-da. 
(Cnonals.) 
To her papa next day I 
went, 
He gave me a 
look of great astonishment; 
Said he, " I 
never knew my daughter loved you ; 
You may have her." 
Says I, " Huzza!" 
We are married now, and oh, what joy, 
Nothing can our wedded life annoy, 
For we've lately got a 
little boy, 
And he calls Inc da-da.

The moon is out to-night, love, floating in the sky, 
Little stars are laughing, as she passes by ; 
All the little songsters sing a 
merry tune, 
Happy as they can be, singing to the moon ; 
Clouds with silver lining, floating in the sky, 
For the moon to pass them— Kitty, so am I; 
But we come to meet you with a 
happy smile, 
To tell you how I 
love you, sitting on the stile.

The moon is out to- night, love, meet me with a 
smile, 
I've something sweet to tell you, sitting on the stile ; 
Kiss me when you meet me, Kitty of the glen, 
And when I 
go to leave you, I'll give it back again. 
The moon is out to- night, love, all the roses blush 
When the gentle night-winds tell the birds to hush ; 
For I 
want to listen for a 
merry voice, 
Whose every note is music, and makes my heart rejoice. 
Kitty, I 
am waiting, to see if I 
can see 
Some one like a 
fairy coming toWard me ; 
And the little angels, coming once again, 
Join the kiss of true love for Kitty of the glen. (Cno.)

Not for Joseph. II 
Joseph Baxter is my name,

I'm up, you know, to every game, 
And every thing I

If he knows it, not for Joseph,

In a

Paddy Connor's Wake.

AS SUNG BY ARCHY IMGHES, OP HOOLEY'S Aln.STRELS. 
Now Paddy Connor died 
Just as the day was breaking, 
His fri'nds they all assembled, 
Quite dacently, to wake him— 
A score of Paddy's fri'nds, 
They dropped in unawares, 
And sat down on the top of the floor 
Because there was no chairs. 
CHORUS. 
Now young and old, none with fear be shakin', 
Men with courage bold, at Paddy Connor's wakin'. 
There was little dumty Mike, 
Tim Murphy and his brother 
And there was Bill Barlow, 
And also NVas his mother ; 
There was Torn Gassoon, 
Shure wasn't he the bold one? 
Had on a

Made out of his father's old one. (Clio.)

The whisky it was boiling, 
Eyes there were punched out, 
And children they were squalling;

The corpse got two black eyes— 
Oh, bad luck to such behavior. (CHORUS.) 
Blow de Bugle.

Attention, please, I 
ask you all 
To listen to my rhymes; 
It's all about things as they go, in 
The present troubled times; 
But nothing is moving me a 
bit, 
'Oa'se I'm too fond of fun; 
I 
pass my time in singing, 
And the beating of the drum. 
CHORUS—Then blow de bugle, beat the drum, 
As marching off we go, 
And traitors to our noble flag 
We'll send them down below. 
Things do change so nowadays, 
You can't tell when you're right, 
For to-day if you're a 
hunky old boy, 
You will sure go up by night ; 
There's several men in office 
Who is robbing the Gove'ment, 
And if they ain't berry careful they'll be cotched, 
And to Sing Sing will be sent: 
(CHORUS.) 
Now we grow wiser every day, 
And if we don't we should, 
By giving office to the men 
Who fought for our nation's good; 
Now General Grant has got 
The Presidential chair, 
And surely the people, one and all, 
Will uphold him while he's there. (Cnonus.)

The old-fashioned cot's lonely now, 
For thy sweet face and smile they here see; 
'Tis the very same spot thou wert born, 
Near by to the old mountain tree. 
Still they think of and love thee the same 
As when first you left it to roam, 
And they weep as they ne'er wept before, 
To-night, while I 
write thee from home.

Return to thy home once again, 
/For to- night do they wish you were there; 
So quickly come, hasten to them,

If still you continue to roam, 
To return them a

Then again will I

Lather vs. Love. 
AS SUNG BY BILLY RICE, OF HOOLEY'S MINSTRELS. 
PH sing of a 
darky that used to live here, 
He was a 
melodious, sweet-scented coon ; 
His hair it was curly, his heels double-jointed, 
He was brigadier-chief in a 
barber saloon. 
Every morning, to see him a-handling the razor, 
Folks they'd gather in crowds round the door, 
They all'd exclaim, when he slapped on the lather, 
Such a 
sweet-scented barber they'd never seen before. 
There was a 
young damsel named Sally Magundi, 
Provost-marshal was she in a 
kitchen close by, 
And she'd pass by the shop as she went to the market, 
And in at the barber she'd throw a 
sheep's eye. 
And the barber he'd wait until she'd return, 
And then to the door he quickly would run, 
And a 
box of pomade he'd slip in her basket, 
Then drink her health in a 
pint of bay rum. 
A 
little Dutch sausage- butcher, his name was Hans Schmid, 
lie heard of the barber, so jealous he grew, 
He loaded a 
bladder with kidneys and doughnuts, 
Then straight for this sweet- scented barber he flew. 
The battle commenced, the slaughter was awful, 
They with murder intent at each other did rush, 
But the barber he soon got the best of the butcher, 
For he blew out his brains with a 
lathering- brush. 
Star of the Twilight. 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star, 
Gladly I

Night closes o'er ye, rest ye awhile ;

Star of the twilight, beautiful star, 
Star of the twilight, beautiful star. 
Eagerly watching, waiting for thee, 
Lcoks the lone traveler o'er the dark sea;

Their glorious Bitter Beer.

So give them while we are here, 
Three cheers for Bass & Allsop, 
And their glorious " Bitter Beer."

Madeira and Moselle, 
Not one of those boshy wines 
Revives this languid sW7e11. 
Of all complaints, from " A to Z," 
The fact is very clear, 
There's no disease but what's been cured 
By Bass's Bitter Beer. (CuoRus.) 
I've lived in Scotland many years, 
And drunk its mountain dew, 
I 
don't deny but what it's good, 
And a

As many think, I

But give to me a 
cooling draught 
Of Bass's Bitter Beer. (Cnontrs.

AS SUNG BY ARCHY HUGHES,

I 
once loved a 
girl and they called her Jemima, 
She lived in New Jersey, just over the hill, 
Her eyes were as bright as a 
hen that is setting, 
Her teeth were as white as a 
porcupine's quills; 
Her nose it was Roman, just like a 
young.parrot's, 
Her lips were like sole-leather, partially tanned, 
Her mouth was a 
whopper, and more like a

That runs under Bergen, but much better planned. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty Jemilna, oh! cruel Jemima, 
You naughty Jemima, that lives over the hill. 
Her dress it was cut in the latest of fashion, 
And looked for the world like mush melon peels, 
On top of her head she wore a 
great pumpkin, 
With ribbons that hung nearly down to her heels; 
Her hair was red auburn, and handsomely frizzled, 
Done up in a 
waterfall wonderful high, 
Her feet—oh ! you &aides, I 
wish you had seen them I 
They looked like two crocodiles, spread out to dry. 
Now could you believe it, this cruel one left me, 
And sloped with another man, richer, you see, 
His father at one time sold clams in Canarsie, 
A new park commissioner bold now is he; 
Oh, cruel Jemima, you naughty Jemima, 
How could you deceive such a 
poor lad as I?

fly that's been smothered in ' lasses, 
And pinned on the wall to be left there to die.

On the beach at Long Branch, 
One fine summer's day, 
I'd a 
novel reading, 
To pass the time away, 
And so interested 
Was I 
in the plot, 
A gent stood there beside me, 
Still I 
saw him not ; 
Till at last my eyelids 
I 
did chance to raise, 
I 
found him on me looking, 
With enraptured gaze: 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, 
Handsome Grecian nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness, 
Quite the pink of beaux. 
CIIORIIS—On the beach at Long Branch, 
One fine summer's day, 
I 
met this handsome man, 
Who stole my heart away 
Now I 
feel so blissful, 
The happy moments glide, 
The day is quickly coming, 
When I 
shall be his bride. 
As like one awaking 
From some happy dream, 
We glances did exchange, 
His eyes with love did beam 
And e'er much time was over, 
We began to chat, 
flours passed away, 
Still he beside me sat; 
And with ways so winning, 
lie did love impart; 
My spirits rose as high 
As the early morning lark ;

GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
He told me that he loved me, 
Said that all his life 
Would be to him worthless, 
Unless I'd be his wife. 
He said if I 
would marry, 
All troubles we would drown, 
And live in blissful ignorance 
Of all the cares of town ; 
With soft persuasive power, 
He told me of his love, 
Vowing to be true, 
By all the stars above ; 
He asked me if I'd marry, 
Pressed me then to say, 
Till to his wishes yielding, 
I 
named the happy day; 
He said his cup of bliss 
Was filled to the brim, 
He lived alone for me, 
And I 
alone for him. 
Teddy O'Neale. 
(Cuonus.)

I've come to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As neat a 
mud palace as ever was seen ; 
And consid'ring it served to keep poultry and pigs in, 
I'm sure it was always most elegant clean. 
But now all about it seems lonely and dreary, 
All sad and all silent, no piper, no reel ; 
Not even the sun through the casement is cheery, 
Since I 
miss the dear, darling boy, Teddy O'Neale. 
I 
dreamt but last night— oh ! bad luck to my dreaming, 
I'd die if I 
thought ' Mould come truly to pass— 
But I 
dreamt., while tears down my pillow were streaming, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass ; 
Oh ! didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing ? 
The grief of that thought was too deep to conceal ; 
My mother cried, " Norah, child, what is your ailing ?" 
And all I 
could utter was, " Teddy O'Neale."

Shall I 
never forget, when the big ship was ready, 
And the moment was come when my love must depart, 
How I 
sobbed, like a 
spalpeen, " Good-by to you, Teddy," 
With drops on my cheek and a 
stone at my heart ? 
He says ' tis to better his fortune he's roving, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel 
If I 
saw him come back to me, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own darling, Teddy O'Neale. 
Grecian Bend.

And old ones pass away, 
To try and dress the oddest 
Is the order of the day. 
In this progressive age, you see 
Some sights, you may depend, 
But that which caps the climax now 
Is called the Grecian bend. 
Cuonts—Throw out your chest, turn up your nose, 
Your hair stuck up on end ; 
Lace tight your waist, walk on your toes, 
Then you have the Grecian Bend.

I 
am a 
fashionable young man, 
As you may plainly see, 
For as I 
go through tie streets, 
The girls all wink at me. 
To attend a 
ball or opera, 
Or dance a 
la can- can— 
I 
am always in my glory, 
For I 
am George, the ladies' map. 
I 
go to church on Sunday nights, 
Though it is a 
horrid bore 
To sit an hour in that dull place, 
And hear old women snore. . 
But as they sing the closing hymn, 
At the entrance then I 
stand, 
Then up the street with a 
Grecian Bend 
Goes George, the ladies' man. 
My salary is quite limited, 
Though a 
clerk in the custom house, 
I 
manage to keep myself well dressed, 
Though poor as a 
church mouse. 
I'm afraid I 
will have to marry rich, 
For that now is my only plan, 
Or the Eagle soon will report the death 
Of George, the ladies' man. 
The Minstrel and the Song. 
Amid the city's busy throng 
I 
heard the minstrel sing his lay ; 
But few would listen to his song, 
The world, neglectful, turned away; 
The music floated from the crowd, 
And mingled with the upper air; 
I 
traced its measure, deep, not loud, 
And heard it melting sweetly there. 
GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER.

I 
saw the minstrel turn away, 
But more in sorrow than disdain; 
Too oft it was his lot to play - 
The music that he loved in vain; 
'Tis thus that all that pleasure gives 
Must know neglect, must suffer wrong ; 
The poet in the future lives, 
The minstrel dies, but not the song 
Look Out and Mind Your Eye.

Alone I 
soothed her pillow, 
Ti- night she sleeps in the little grave 
Beneath the weeping willow.

In her silent little grave, 
And the blue- birds warble sweetly 
Where our darling Effle's laid.

The roses and the violets bloom, 
Fresh as the mountain dew;

From yonder bush below, 
And plant them ' side the little grave 
Beneath the weeping willow.

Her golden auburn hair, 
Her pleasant smiles and winning ways,

I'll ne'er forget the little grave 
Beneath the weeping willow. (CHonus.)

Once I 
was happy, but now I'm forlorn, 
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn, 
Left in this wide world to fret and to mourn, 
Betrayed by a 
maid in her ' teens. 
The girl that I 
loved she was handsome, 
I 
tried all I 
knew her to please, 
But I 
could not please her one quarter so well, 
Like that man upon the trapeze. 
CHORUS. 
He'd fly through the air with the greatest of ease, 
A daring young man on the flying trapeze, 
His movements were graceful, all girls he could please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man by name was " Signor Bona Slang," 
Tall, big and handsome, as well-made as Chang, 
Where'er he appeared the hall loudly rang 
With ovation from all people there ; 
He smiled from the bar on the people below, 
And one night he smiled on my love, 
She winked back at him and she shouted " Bravo!" 
As he hung by his nose up above.

Her filthier and mother were both on my side, 
And very hard tried to make her my own bride, 
Her father he sighed, and her mother she cried, 
To see her throw herself away. 
'Twas all no avail, she went there every night, 
And would throw him bouquets on the stage, 
Which caused him to meet her—how he ran me down, 
To tell you would take a 
whole page. (Cnoms.) 
One night I 
as usual went to her dear home, 
Found there her father and mother alone, . 
I 
asked for my love, and soon they made known, 
To my horror, that she'd run away 1 
GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
She packed up her box and eloped in the night, 
With him with the greatest of ease, 
From two stories high, he had lowered her down 
To the ground on his flying trapeze. (Caonus.) 
Some months after this I 
went to a 
hall, 
Was greatly surprised to see on the wall 
A 
bill in red letters, which did my heart gall, 
That she was appearing with him. 
He taught her gymnastics and dressed her in tights, 
To help him to live at his ease, 
And made her assume a 
masculine name, 
And now she goes on the trapeze. 
CHORUS. 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease, 
You'd think her a 
man on the flying trapeze, 
She does all the work while he takes his ease, 
And that's what's become of my love.

The Organ-Grinder. 
A POPULAR COMIC SONG. 
You see before you a 
young man 
Who mourns both night and day, 
For the loss of a 
pretty girl named Fan, 
Who has stolen his heart away ; 
She said she loved me faithfully, 
And vowed we ne'er would part, 
But she's gone away with an organ-man, 
And broken this poor heart, heart, heart. 
CHORUS. 
So I 
mourns for the loss of the girl I 
love, 
I 
don't know where to find her ; 
She's gone away from her turtle- dove, 
With a 
nasty organ-grinder. 
At a 
twelve-roomed house in Canonbury Square, 
She lived as kitchen-maid, 
Six pounds a 
year and all she could find 
Was the salary she got paid. 
Oh, -how often down those area steps 
I've crept like an old Tom-cat, 
And after having a 
good blow-out, 
I've filled my poor old hat, hat, hat. (Cnonus.) 
Out of all the servants in the square, 
She used to take the shine; 
She'd a 
delicate turn in her ankle, 
And a 
great big crinoline ; 
When she used to clean the front door-steps, 
How the chaps they used to stare, 
And throw sheep's eyes and heave big sighs, 
Which made me tear my hair, hair, hair. (Cno.) 
Now I 
soon began to notice 
That whenever I 
passed that way, 
There was always an organ-grinder there, 
A-grinding " Old Dog Tray." 
GEORGE THE CHARMER SONGSTER. 
He'd grind and grind, until he found 
lie couldn't- grind any more ; 
And when they told him to move on, 
He'd go and grind next door. 
45 
(Caohus.) 
Now, one day " Fan " asked this organ man 
To play her " Uncle Sam," 
She gave him coppers in return, 
And a 
plate of " cold roast lamb." 
Then he told her he was of noble blood, 
And would be a 
marquis one fine day; 
In fact, he told her such thundering lies, 
That with him she eloped away—that day. 
(CHO.) 
Well, the last I 
heard of the happy pair, 
'Twas down in Pimlico ; 
The fellow was a-grinding on his instrument of torture, 
And Fan played the " old banjo ;" 
But to mourn any more for a 
girl like that, 
I 
should only be a 
dunce ; 
So I'll think no more of Fan and her organ man, 
But hope they'll get six months. 
CHORUS. 
So no more I'll mourn for the girl I 
loved, 
And no more I'll try to find her; 
She may go and be Wowed for what I 
care, 
Yes, and so may her organ-grinder. 
The Sapling Oak. 
The sapling oak lost in the dell, 
Where tangled brakes its beauties spoil, 
And every infant shock repel, 
Droops hopeless o'er the exhausted soil. 
Atlength the woodman clears around, 
Whereer the noxious thickets spread, 
And high reviving o'er the ground, 
The forest monarch lifts its head.

Although I 
try to be myself, 
It makes me awful wild 
To find that I 
am somebody else, 
In fact, nobody's child. 
CHORUS— I 
never had a 
father, I

mother, 
I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child ; 
I 
never had a 
sister, I 
never had a 
brother, 
In fact, I'm nobody's child. 
If I 
was anyhody's son, 
My father he would be, 
And if be had a 
son, why, 
What relation's he to me? 
Supposing she's my brother, 
And the muddle to increase, 
Why then that makes me out a 
boy, 
My uncle's sister's niece. 
(CHORUS.) 
Whose child am I? why nobody's, 
What shall I 
do ? 
If I 
belong to nobody, 
Let me belong to you; 
Kind ladies and good gentlemen, 
Who on my face have smiled, 
Give me your hands, 
And your applause on nobody's child.

Velocipediana. 
51 
The velocipede isn't exactly a 
wagon, 
Being only two wheels and a 
saddle, 
But is rather a 
nag than a 
vehicle, 
That a 
man sits and rides on astraddle. 
Just two wheels, and no more, of which one goes before, 
With a 
crank on each side for propelling, 
And the other one, smaller, comes jogging behind— 
Just the " wickedest" thing that is sailing. 
You must sit on the saddle and steady yourself, 
Then you pump with both legs like the d— 1, 
Holding firmly, meanwhile, to the handle, to steer, 
When it " gits," if your head's only " level." 
It's a 
jolly fast nag, and will take you to town 
At a 
two- forty gait, if well curried, 
But your head on the ground will too forte resound, 
If your steed's badly managed or hurried. 
It will stand without hitching, keep fat without oats, 
And will never get frightened or frisky, 
It will never run off with the bit in its teeth, 
When you call at the corner for whisky. 
It is not at all tricky unless you are green, 
When, look out, or you'll find yourself sprawling ; 
It will never get balky on any good pike, 
And is handy on New Years for calling. 
It's a 
sort of a 
hybrid, though not any mule, 
But a 
steed which " you bet " we can brag on, 
And for changing one's base is the ?llama thule, 
On two wheels, with a 
crank and a 
wag on. 
Life's a 
Bumper. 
Life's a 
bumper filled by fate, 
Let us guests enjoy the treat, 
Nor, like silly mortals, pass 
Life, as ' twere but half a 
glass; 
GEORGE TILE cnAnmtn SONGSTER. 
Let this scene with joy be crowned, 
Let the glee and catch go round ; 
All the sweets of life combine, 
Mirth and music, love and wine. 
Waiting for a 
Broadway Stage. 
Entered according; to Act of Congres=, by OLIVER DITSON & CO., Music 
Publishers, 277 Washington street, Boston. 
As up Broadway I 
strolled one day, 
To see the styles pass by, 
A pretty little girl I 
very soon met, 
And she had such a 
roguish eye; 
Her little short skirts in points hung down, 
For that style's all the rage, 
She was looking up and down with a 
pretty little frown, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
Olt! • 
CHORUS. 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage, 
Sweet sixteen was just her age, 
I 
met her on the corner, it was there that I 
first saw her, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet little smile like a 
beam, 
Just played round her face, and with such ease and grade, 
Why like a 
little angel she did seem. 
But I 
kept getting like any one in fear, 
For my heart felt like a 
bird that's in a 
cage, 
how I 
wished I'd never seen that handsome little queen, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage. 
Oh! (Cuourrs.) 
But as the ice was broken, my hat, of course, I 
raised, 
As the stage that she required soon came by, 
When she said in tones so sweet, perhaps some time we'll meet, 
As up the steps her little form did 
But I 
never since have seen her, so I 
wander in despair, 
For it seems that since she left me ' twas an age; 
But I 
never shall forget that little girl I 
met 
Waiting for a 
Broadway stage.

My cognomen is Racketty Jack, 
A noisy swell am I, 
I 
care not how the world may wag, 
I 
never will say die ; 
In grog and beer I 
do indulge, 
Sometimes in cliquot, too, 
A bottle of " phizz " is all my eye,

For beauty I 
admire, 
For a 
spree I'm always fresh, 
You see, what's bred in the bones, my boys, 
Is sure to come out in the flesh. 
(CHORUS.) 
I 
never fall out with a 
policeman, 
Nor cheat a 
hackman's fare, 
Nor, like low swells, wrench knockers off, 
And kick stalls in the air ; 
For I 
can true enjoyment find, 
With friends like you at my back, 
So enjoy yourselves as long as you can, 
And hurrah for Racketty Jack. (Cliontra)

Is walking down Broadway; 
My sisters through the Park, 
And at Long Branch wish to stay, 
But I 
prefer to walk 
Down the festive, gay Broadway. 
CLIORUS—Walking down Broadway,

The 0. K. thing on Saturday 
Is walking down Broadway. 
Last Wednesday afternoon, 
My cousin Will did say, 
"Nellie, come along with me, 
I'll take you down Broadway— 
To the Theater Comique, 
To see Captain Jinks so gay, 
Then we'll dine at Delmonico's,

But sartin and thrue, in that hill forninst you, 
There's an echo as Unite and as safe as the bank, too, 
Just civilly spake, " How d'ye do, Paddy Blake ?" 
And the echo politely says, " Very well, thank you." 
One day Teddy Keogh, with Kate Connor did go 
To hear from the echo this wonderful talk, sir, 
But the echo, they say, was conthrary that day, 
Or perhaps Paddy Blake had gone out for a 
walk, sir.

We'll make up an echo between us, my daisy." 
"Now-,

"Oh, very well, thank you," says Kitty, then, sir ; 
" 
Would you like to be wed, Kitty darlin'?" says Ted, 
" 
Oh, very well, thank you," says Kitty again, sir. 
"Do you like me ?" says Teddy, and Kitty, quite ready, 
Cried, " Very well, thank you," with laughter beguiling; 
I 
think you'll confess Teddy could not do less, 
Than pay his respects to the lips that were smiling. 
Oh, dear Paddy Blake, may you never forsake 
Those hills that return us such echoes endearing, 
And gills all translate their sweet answers like Kate, 
No faithfulness doubting, no treachery fearing;

As I 
was walking down the street, 
Last week, one nice line day, 
A dashing girl I 
chanced to meet, 
Dressed out in fashions gay ; 
She sweetly smiled on this young gent, 
To her my hand I 
kissed, 
And turning back I 
quickly went, 
To the girl with the Grecian Twist. - 
CnoBus—But her hair was black and the twist was red, 
So soon after I 
was missed ; 
And since that day I 
never have seen 
That girl with the Grecian Twist. 
My arm I 
offered unto her, 
Which quickly she did take, 
And we walked as far as a 
saloon, 
And had cobblers, cream and cake. 
At last we started out to go, 
When something then ;she missed, 
And turning pale, she said to me, 
" 
I've dropped my Grecian Twist." (
CHowns.) 
We walked straight up to Union Square, 
And looked round left and right, 
And I 
said unto this damsel fair, 
" 
There is no twist in sight." 
Just then we passed a 
large, tine store, 
Where twists were hung to view, 
And I 
said, " Just wait a 
moment, dear, 
Anil I'll get a 
twist for you." (

I 
went in the store and got a 
twist 
The size of a

Then took her home about a 
mile, 
But there I 
did not wait ; 
For her hair was black and the twist was red, 
So soon after I 
was missed, 
And since that day I 
never have seen

Her glances pierced me through and through, 
Her name was Annie Searles; 
Her eyes were blue, and oh! she had 
Such lovely auburn curls. 
CHORUS—But oh ! she was unkind to me, 
And I 
wouldn't care a

Would set your heart on tire ; 
Oh, there was something in that girl 
You could not but admire ! 
And when she laughed or gave a 
smile, 
She showed two rows of pearls; 
I 
never saw such charms before, 
Nor yet such auburn curls. (Cnoitus.) 
One day I 
asked my Annie dear 
If her lovely hair was dyed;

And boxed my ears beside.

nearly fell upon the floor, 
Alas ! poor Annie Searles— 
I 
made a

Were the lovely auburn curls. (Cuone-''. 
And now I'm down on all young girls,

let. By canceling from the list two-thirds of those hitherto published In the se-
ries, as not being up to the standard to which he will bring each and every succeed-
ing issue. 
2d. By calling into requisition the best authors in the field of Border and Indian 
Romance, and Life in the West. 
3d. By adopting the title AMERICAN STAR NOVELS, and using the Star as a 
trade-
mark. 
The list of books now identined with this series comprises works of rare inter-
est and novelty. 
The new volumes forthcoming will be of the same sterling char-
acter, delineating, in graphic and original style, Adventures and Incidents of the 
Trapping-ground, the Frontier Settlement, the Forest Camp, the Trail, the Woods, 
the Waters and the Prairies of the Far West. 
The design will be to produce the 
best books of their kind in the world, far surpassing any of the other"ten cent books 
now in the market.
