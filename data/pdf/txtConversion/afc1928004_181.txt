MTh AND MRS. RILEY. 
As sung by THE FIELDINGS. -
fle.—OIT ! Judy dear, I 
feel so queer, 
Whene'er I 
think about you, 
Both day, and night, you're in my sight, 
I 
cannot live without you ;— 
A 
pig, a 
cow, a 
sheep I've got, 
A 
house to keep you drily, 
So say the word, and like a 
shot, 
I'll make you sirs. Riley. 
&c. 
She—Now Mr. Pat, get out of that, 
With your silly botheration, 
For when you talk to me like that, 
You 1111 me with vexation : 
Although you've kissed the blarney stone, 
You can't coax me so slyly, 
I'd rather stilrbe Miss Malone, 
Judy 
Than... 
Ritidifolol, &C. 
He—I 
know the reason very well, 
To my offer you're no taker, 
You've fell in love with Mickey Ball, 
The wooden-legged shoemaker ; 
But let him mind his from this, 
When next I 
ketch him hobbling, 
I'll give him such a 
thump of this, [ Shows stick] 
By jabers it will spoil his cobbling. 
Ritidifolol, &c. 
She—Although he's lame—he's lots of cash, 
And a 
man of great discerning, 
He's got sweet taste 
He—The ugly baste, 
I'll spoil him for his learning ; 
She—When I 
am his, -without mishap, 
Like doves we'll live together. 
He—He'll wollop you with his cobbling strap, 
And you'll never want for leather. 
• 
Ritidifolol, &c. 
e—Now Mister Pat, just hould yer gab, 
Your spaking does not please me, 
Some one would think, to see your trick.% 
That love had made you crazy ; 
He—You've hit the nail, right on the head, 
Now don't be acting slyly, 
Take that! (KISSES TIER) and in a 
jiffey say% 
You'll be Mrs. Riley. 
She—Now Paddy dear—one can't resist, 
At coaxine- your so clever, 
And since you do so much insist, 
Why I'll be yours forever ; 
He—I 
knew you would, you little goat, 
Let's away to Father Wiley's, 
And very soon we'll till the house, 
She—(SroKEN) With what Paddy ?—

As Sung by THE FIELDINGS. 
He.—I'VE come far over the hills, 
My col:cen for to see, 
The moon is up in the sky, 
I 
wonder where she can be ? 
Thu Rooney, the hogtrotting elf, 
To my Mary did propose, 
If I 
catch him at it again, 
break his n2,-ly nose. 
[Enter Mary L. H.] 
She.--My Pat is standing there, 
He's waiting too for me, 
The finest lad is he, 
From the LiffIty to to the sea. 
I 
love him so dearly too, 
But my brain in anger whirls, 
When I 
see him at the Fair, 
Kissing the other girls. 
He. —Au! there you are my dear, 
It is yourself I 
see, 
She.—Now, plaze your distance kape, , 
talk to Biddy McGee ; 
I 
saw you at the fair, 
With your arm around her waist. 
He.--Yon 
mind that darling, 
Its only an Irishman's taste. 
She.—I'm glad you told me that, 
taste is mighty fine, 
Her nose it does turn up, 
jn oro ('€! 
be is 
He.—But the other one is good, 
With such a 
winning lurch; 
She.—Her tongue it runs as fast,. 
As the clock in the village church. 
He.—But she has lots of pigs-, 
' Which is quite good you know, 
She.—She's got a 
hump on her back, 
And her legs bend like a 
bow ; 
He.— She's forty pounds in the bank, 
Perhaps a 
pound or two more, 
She.—Her mouth runs from ear to ear, 
As big as the chapel door. 
He.—But Mary has a 
snug cabin. 
She.—Well haven't I, you spooney. 
He.—But yours you know Mary, 
has been ax'd by Tim. Rooney; 
She.—Do you think it's the likes of him, 
That could get the likes of me, 
I 
hate that spalpecn as bad, as  
• 
He.—You do poor Biddy McGee. 
He.—Mary, there's one thing I 
think, 
Will surely plaze your taste, 
Just put your arm in mine, 
And let's go unto the Praste ; 
She.—Is it the truth, you're spaking now, 
Or my feelings wish to try 9— 
He.— Let's get married now, darling, 
And— 
She.—[SpokEs Well, what's the matter now, Paddy

At the Women's Rights Convention. 
Oh whack fal de ral, &c. 
He— What is this Women's Convention, 
Pray tell me if you can,

On equality with the man; 
We are to vote, hold office too, 
All kinds of lines pursue, 
And if the men, stay out all night, 
Why the women can do it too. 
Whack fal de ral, &c. 
He—When that law's pass'd—what will we do,

Clean the knives, the forks and spoons,

And you take my pantaloons.

Or round "Free Lunelits" roam,

JOHNNY SQUIRLS, 
Sang by MAGGIE F

I 
ONCE courted a 
boy like other girls, 
His name it was Johnny Squids, 
He lived in a 
place called Grinlico, 
But I 
wish he'd been at Jericho. 
Cuonus. 
Hi too ral looral, loo ral laddidy, 
Riti looral I 
doo. 
He looks so neat, he dressed so sweet, 
And didn't he show his pretty feet, 
Ills hair was red, his eyes were blue, 
And I 
imagined he loved me true. 
RI too ral, &c. 
I 
courted him for near a 
year, • 
When a 
rich old suitor did appear, 
She followed him everywhere about, 
One foot in the grave, the other with gout. 
RI too ral, 
But man he's as false as fair, 
Although I 
raved and tore my hair, 
He cut me dead for that old gal, 
Wed her and went to Paris to dwell. 
Rt too ml, cte.

• 
Now as Johnny can't be my husband, 
As sure as I'm alive I'll end my life. 
I've a 
child, so don't stay if you're told, 
I've committed infanticide so bold, 
And married been beneath the mould, 
Though artfully I 
have been sold, 
He spurned me all fur love and gold; 
But when my ghost he does behold, 
if ghosts can talk, he won't I 
scold, 
And her bed-post fast I'll hold, 
And cry your small game out, Pm told 
With fright he'll ugly turn and old, 
Then in a 
moment grow gray poll'd, 
And when out of bed he's rolled, 
He will in a 
moment turn quite cold, 
Then him in my arms I 
will enfold, 
And bear him away, where— 
Little Jack Horner sat in the corner, 
Eating his piece of Christmas pie, 
lie put in his thumb, 
And pulled out a 
plum, 
And said— 
High diddle diddle, 
The cat in the fiddle, 
The cow jumps over the moon, 
The little dog laughed to see the sight, 
So I 
hope I've pleased you all to-night. 
Hi too ral, &c. 
JUDY AND DARBY. 
Written and sung by THE F.IILDINGs. 
OH, here we are as you can plainly see, 
A happy Irish couple just from across the sea 
We left old lreland four weeks ago to day, 
For the City of New York in the State of America. 
Oh Judy Oh Darby ! 
Hurrah for the ould sod, 
We'll stick as close together, 
As the turf that's in the bogs. 
'Twas hard to part from poor old Ireland, 
Where we saw the first light of day, 
But the rent and taxes and the famine, 
It drove us all away ; 
Oh Judy, Oh Darby ; 
I 
hope the time we'll see, 
When old Ireland's like America, 
Shall wave the Banner of the free; 
Oh Judy, oh Darby; 
Hurrah for the ould sod, 
We'll stick as close together, 
As the turf that's in the bogs. 
On next election I 
run for Congress, 
Arrah pon me sowl Darby that's time I'll dress, 
Arrah why pot Judy, I'll make money by the pail, 
Pure I 
never knew a 
congressman but what lirvw 
49W to Btale 
Oh Judy, oh Darby; 
Oh when we have the stamps, 
We'll let Congress go to the divil, 
And ate oysters at Long branch, 
But if Ireland had a 
President, darling. 
And a 
Congress of her own, 
Free from tyrants like America, 
Sure ' tis that we'd make our home, 
Oh Judy, oh Darby; 
I 
hope the time we'll see, 
When ould Ireland like America, 
Shall wave the Banner of the freo, 
Oh Judy, oh Darby : 
Hurrah for the ould sod. 
We'll stick as close together, 
As the turf that's in the bogs. 
Sung by Miss M AGGIE FIELDING 
YOUNG ladies tarry, think e'er you marry, 
A 
lesson pray. take from that I 
sing, 
For though black slaves are of course unknown here, 
We wives you'll find are the slaves of the ring, 
Our husbands nightly, most impolitely 
With their companions abroad will roam, 
Of us ne'er thinking, they go off drinking, 
While wo are crying our eyes out at home. 
CHORUS. 
Think, think, how slowly the moments pass, 
While you're enjoying your pipe and gliss, 
Think, think how slowly the moments pass, 
Now gentlemen pray mind what I 
say, 
And look, look at the clock. 
Now thus to leave us, and so deceive us, 
I'm sure you'll own is a 
monstrous sin, 
For there's no knowing where you are going, 
Or what bad company you may get in, 
For when you tell, deceitful fellows, 
That at your club you have passed the night. 
At that casino you're often seen oh, 
You must acknowledge now that is not right, 
Think, think, & c. 
Then when returning we're soon discerning, 
That in your manner there's something queer, 
You whisper Salmon but that's all gammon, 
It's something stronger than that I 
fear, 
It must he really, for when awaking, 
A 
noise you're maiting for a 
cup of tea, 
You didn't ought to want Soda water, 
Through eating Salmon you must agree, 
Think, think, &T. 
The cradle rocking or mending stockings, 
The time we strive hard to pass away, 
While you are flirting your health too hurtkig, 
By stopping out till the break of day; 
Besides suspicions will sometimes enter our heads, 
While sitting up waiting alone, 
About your latch keys for \vho's to know, pray, 
What doors they open besides your own. 
Think, think, .Sze.

Just fall in line, 
And march away while we bate the time, 
And don't we all,

In my regiment there's just nine, 
And seven of them are blind; 
Our enemy it is whiskey, 
We fight it every day, 
And it generally gets the best of you,

IRISH PEG FROM TIPPERARY, 
Written by JOHN FIELDING& 
I'VE just come o'er from Tipperary, 
Where I 
worked all in the bogs, 
Digging turf for a 
man named Haley, 
For a 
shilling a 
day, and my grog. 
But God between us and all harm, 
I've lost the use of me legs, 
Now if you want paynuts or apples, 
Buy them of poor Irish Peg. 
I 
can scarcely walk across the street, 
I 
can hardly sleep at night, 
Oh if I 
could only get married, 
I 
know ' mould save my poor life. 
Now gentlemen on me take pity, 
Here's a 
chance so come ahead, 
Just take me while I'm in the humor, 
Who will have poor Irish Peg. 
Thank you, kind sir, I've just got your note, 
I 
will meet you to-morrow, 
That gentleman here with the white coat, 
Has relieved all my sorrow, 
In his note here he says my dear Peg, 
I 
love you, just name the day, 
When you and I 
shall to the church go, 
Then you will be Mrs. Mike Shay.

HAVE lately come to town, 
For Ireland I

Many happy days I

I

But there's not a 
spot so dear, 
As the land where the little shamrock grows.. 
CHORUS. 
In the land, in the land, 
In the land, boys, sweet Paddy's Land, 
Then cheer up for Erin's Isle, 
And the girls I 
left behind, 
So I'm bound for poor ould Ireland, 
Bight away, so I 
am. 
Ould Erin, my dear home, 
I 
am proud to call my own, 
For many years her valleys I've not seen, 
But there's not a 
spot on earth, 
For fun, wit and mirth, 
Like that dear little island fair and green. 
In the land, & c. 
There's the rakish boys of Hallow, 
And the Wexford boys so yellow, 
But the boys of Tipperary arc gay and free, 
With shillelahs they let fly, 
For Ireland fight and die, 
Sweet Granna you are me gramacree, 
In the land, & c.

PADDY THE PIPER. 
Sung by KATE CHASE & Scorns. 
WHEN I 
was a 
boy in my father's mud edifice, 
Naked and bare as a

,Out of the door as I 
looked with a 
phiz, 
Who but Pat Murphy the piper came by, 
SayS Paddy, few can play this music, can you play,

don't know, for I 
never did try, 
Then he towld me tOt he had a 
charm 
For to make the pipes beatOull,Y speak, 
o

And then prettily he made them squeak.

With his whack fal, lal, lal, du ral la, 
Oh ! how he handled the drome, 
And then such sweet music he blew, 
'Twould have melted the heart of a 
stone. 
Your pipes, said T, Paddy, they nately come over me, 
Naked I'll wander where ever you goes, 
And if that my parents should try to discover me, 
Sure it won't be by describing my clothes, 
The music I 
hear, now, takes hold of my ear, now, 
And leads me all over the world by the nose,

So I 
followed ins bag pipe so sweet,

sang us I

Good bye to my mansion so neat, 
And so prettily placed in a

For five years we traveled, sure nothing could sunder us, 
Until he one morning stood taking a

We was crossing a 
bridge with the water part under us, 
He went through to the bottom just like a 
blind pup, 
I 
roared out, I 
bawled out, and loudly did shout out, 
Arrah Paddy, my friend, do you mane to come out, 
But he was as dead as a 
nail in a

Poor Paddy we laid on the shelf, 
As I 
picked up his pipes on the shore, 
And no,

Aboard the Mary Chooner, 
And left me here heart broken, 
When I

CHORUS 
But his name was Pat, a

Oh would that I 
could find him, 
But he has gone away across the sea, 
I'm the girl he left behind him. 
In his stockings, he stood six feet three, 
his strength it was gigantic, 
And when he took me in his arms, 
It nearly drove me frantic, 
Bad luck to you, Tom Tapscott, 
For taking my poor darling, 
To sail the salt sea ocean far 
Far away from me. 
But his name, &c. 
I'm scudding under bare poles, 
Now my sad fate bewailing. 
'Thinking of the time, alas, 
When we parted by the railing, 
But he swore upon his pocket-book, 
And on his bended knees, 
By his bulwarks, stanchions and jibbooms,

But his name, &c. 
MY name ' tis Sam, as you must know, 
I 
am the pet of the dragoons, 
I 
wear shoulder straps as you see, 
And stripes upon my pantaloons, 
I

military swell, 
I 
am a 
pet amongst the girls, 
In London I 
am known full well, 
By my whiskers and beautiful curls.

I'm known as Sam,

The ladies they say I 
am a 
duck of a

I'm known as Sam, 
I'm known as Sam, 
In the skinny dragoons I'm known as Sam. 
My mother thinks I'm so sweet, 
And sometimes to me she says, 
Don't you leave the army, son, 
And a 
general you will be some day, 
My papa said now my dear boy, 
Don't be a 
coward, stand by your gun, 
Of course I 
told him that I 
would, 
But the smell of powder makes me run. 
I'm known as Sam, &c.

Of course you know its hard on us, 
One of the Muffin Nine.

And give up the costering trade. 
Here's your. fine, &c.

THE WHIRLEY-GIG, 
W ritten by II Anny ELTON. 
Sung by JonN FIELDING. 
WHILF., visiting some country friends, 
One day I 
did repair, 
To what was thought a 
great treat, 
I 
mean a 
country fair, 
A 
young lady I 
happened to meet, 
Her name I 
believe ' twas 
She said she wiMed to take a 
ride 
Upon the whirley-gig. 
CHORUS. 
Round upon a 
whirley-gig, 
Such a 
queer sensation, you'll not feel anywhere, 
sound upon a 
whirley-gig, 
The strangest thing that's out, 
Is twisting, twirling round and round, 
Upon a 
whirley-gig, 
The fair was like all other fairs, 
With various stands and shows, 
And crowds of country people, 
All dressed in their Sunday clothes, 
We soon got mixed up with the crowd, 
And had to gouge our way, 
To where the swings and whirley gigs, 
Were all in full sway, 
The girl mounted on a 
lion, 
That was singularly tame, 
While I 
boldly bestrode a 
horsc, , 
That close behind her came; 
We soon got started, slow at first. 
I 
felt immensekoff, 
But as the pace increased, 
I 
soon wished myself off. 
Round upon, E 
C. 
Now when the ride was over, 
I 
reeled upon the ground, 
When Rose to my surprise declared, 
She'd have another round, 
But now I 
could not speak a 
word, 
For I 
felt so queer. 
So rushed into a 
saloon, 
And found relief on lager beer.

No king or queen had ought to rule, 
Them jolly Irishmen, 
Them jolly Irishmen, 
Them jolly Irishmen, 
For the stars and stripes they all will fight, 
Them jolly Irishmen. 
'Twas in the town of Ireland, 
Where praties grow so thick, 
Sure I 
never saw an Irish boy, 
But what could twirl a 
stick. 
So God be with ould Ireland, 
Where Irishmen were born, 
Oh many a 
day I 
spint that way, 
With my sweet Colleen Dawn.

OLD FREND JOE. 
LET me tell you, my friends, about Joe, 
His whiskers and hair are like snow, 
And his twinkling eye, 
As he passed yol by, 
A genial warmth and a 
pleasing glow, 
Vould encircle the brow of my friend Joe. 
A 
spotless heart, like his hair, without stain, - 
Never pompous or rude, silly or vain, 
But bold in his might 
To do nothing but right, 
'Twas delightful to see as he walk to and fro, 
How contented and happy was my friend Joe, 
Whenever you met him, wherever he'd go, 
Be was always the same genial, generous Joe, 
-No care would approach him, 
No man could reproach him, 
And what he gave to the poor no one did know, 
For he destroyed all such vouchers did my friend Joe. 
He would take a 
nip but no sign would it show, 
In the face or the conduct of my friend Joe, 
And by the warmth which he shook, 
The hand that he took, 
You could tell in a 
single moment or so, 
That a 
man and a 
brother was my friend Joe. 
55 
Now let's take a 
drink with friend Joe, 
He will pay the expense willimr I 
know, 
Here's long life to him, boys, 
Filled with comfort and joys, 
May he live till we tell him we want him to go, 
That's perpetual good health to our friend Joe, 
• 
Let the wind of cold winter most lightly blow, 
And numberless summers invite friend Joe, 
To remain with us here, 
On this terrestrial sphere, 
Till all whom we cherish, respect, love and know, 
Shall have learned to be happy like my friend Joe.

I'M a 
sample of a 
very lucky man, lucky man, 
And I'm only sorry life, is but a 
span, but a 
span, 
The joys of life keep tumbling in, the stream will never 
cease, 
And if I 
lived a 
hundred years, my pleasures would increase. 
Cllonus. 
For l'm what is called 
very lucky man, 
119.! ha ! ha ! ha! such a 
lucky man. 
And why am I 
a 
very lucky man, lucky man. 
They say because I 
have a 
little plan, yes, a 
plan, 
By which I 
turn to gold, the (lust beneath my feet, 
And wherever gold may lurk, we know each other when 
we meet. 
So I'm, &c. 
To a 
shooting match I 
go, the prizes to gain, yes to gain, 
And my fellow volunteers try in vain, quite in vain, 
The prize is surely mine, for I 
do all I 
can, 
To win, and all the rest are daunted by the lucky mau. 
Oh Pm, &c. 
rm happy, and my heart is light and gay, light and gay, 
And iliat's because I'm lucky, people say, people say, 
It may be so, but, this I 
know, I 
led a 
steady life, 
When young, and at an early age I 
took a 
prudent wife. 
But I'm, Ltc. 
In this world, I 
have succeeded very well, very well, 
They say because you've had a 
lucky pell , 
yes a 
spell, 
That may be true, but this E 
know, I'm :d 
ways at my post, 
And I 
never take my shoulder from the wheel, at any cost. 
But I'm, it-e. 
But it's not against their luck, that people fall, people fall, 
Indeed I 
don't believe in luck at all, not at all, 
In life a 
steady aim, a 
bright and spotless name, 
Will carry all before them, and insure a 
lasting fame. 
And then you'll be, Ltc.

Now silent lie in yonder church-yard,

Little foot-steps soft and gentle,

CHARLOTTE TEPIIPLE. 
Z. those who have never perused the sad story of CHARLOTrif 
joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept tr;Th her in her sorrows, ad glowed with indignation at the 
wr. 4,1 which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortrnate 
-.7b_arlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultlead, and her mini, 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane aad kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah 1 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This .book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a 
striking 
example that vice, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
•-ad leads only to misery and shame.

A little book has lately appeared in print at Messrs. Psher Sr 
Denison's, 98 Nassau street, called " The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
6:ry that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad habit of "flirting.' 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any Parther neces-
sity of explaining " how, when and where to do it," and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, called "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher 434 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the mod us oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford home innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to et.r'. 
young lady and gentlemen readers.
