Introduction 
00:00:25-00:16:12 
One of 10 siblings, raised everything they ate. Mom worked nights, Dad 
days, grew everything they ate including bread. Later changed to taking 
advantage of new products, home raising took backseat. Used to cut meat at 
home. Age 15 started working in meat plant in summers, learned to butcher 
until age 17, did that for 7 years. Got high school credit for it. Did that until 
23, then did meat inspection for 32 years. Retired as Director for Food 
Safety and Consumer Protection for Vermont Agency of Agriculture and 
Food Markets in 2007, then came to current job. Grew up in Milton. Kids 
shared work with Mom and Dad who did canning. Kids worked in garden, 
barn, brought up to help. Both parents worked outside and inside. Shared 
many products made at home with family friends and visitors, always 
sharing. Is middle child of 10. Garden was just over an acre, had fruit trees, 
vegetables, grapevines. Anything to can, including minced meat, stews. Born 
1953, most active in home help 5-6 years old. Had 450 chickens for eggs. 
Late 50s/early 60s started decreasing by 1970s, most kids had grown up

and left home. Still rely on that upbringing, today many people going back to 
that lifestyle. Parents were both from farm families. Dad had farm in 
Waterford, VT shared with his Dad. Did logging, maple sugaring, dairy. Dad 
worked in milk testing, lost leg in service, ended up working for state during 
day and helped at home if he could. Mom was from farm family, lost both 
parents early, but remembered her father as itinerant slaughter. Let 
neighbors know about slaughter, would help neighbors slaughter in fall. 
Other grandfather did same thing. Didn’t feel that connection when started 
this business, learned that later on. Only knew his own home experience at 
first. Had challenges as kid, got polio and was paralyzed at young age, 
worked very hard to get mobility back and interested in meat industry even 
though lots of hard work. Inspection seemed better option because didn’t 
have to do hard physical work, and already knew industry well. Worked 
there for retirement benefits. Parents were very innovative with vegetable 
and fruit growing practices, tried to grow anything. Some of it out of 
necessity to support 10 kids. Appreciate it more now then as kid, a lot of 
work but gave al siblings a work ethic to plan day and accomplish 
something. Very rewarding to see those accomplishments. A little spoiled 
now with conveniences, but glad to have that experience. Everyone could 
benefit from experience like that and from hard work. Even with work, 
always had free time and family time. Didn’t work Sundays as Irish Catholic 
family. Very tangible reward in hard work. “You could look back over your 
work, and there’s a reward that you get and you can’t explain that to 
somebody. When you look over what you’ve done, and the way that it looks 
and the way that you were taught to do it, and that it meant that something 
was going to come back to you tenfold, there was a reward that you just 
can’t explain, yet, it’s a sense, you have to feel it. I’m glad I had that.” Grew 
and raised  90+% of family’s own food. In harvest time especially always 
gave food away, particularly in fall. Was 11 when had first store-bought

bread. Then got another freezer or store bought bread. Had 4 large chest 
freezers, bread in one, frozen corn, making sure always had supply of food. 
00:16:12-00:21:08 
Brother was cutting meat in retail store, then went into commercial 
processing facility when Carl working on farm a lot. Offered Carl a job even 
though only 15 and had to be 16 to handle a knife. Got opportunity to do 
other things before cutting meat, then asked to work on Friday during 
school year because other people couldn’t come in. Homeroom shop teacher 
came into store, held secret they were both cutting school. Teacher helped 
him get credit for meat cutting. Hard work, but very interesting. Very high 
volume low profit job, need to move product. As got older, lifting was 
getting harder with leg brace so decided to stay in industry but move 
towards meat inspection. Worked well to utilize talents, represented 28-
State Meat Inspection Program as President. Liked responsibility of keeping 
meat industry safe and healthy for consumers, but require lots of on your 
feet time. Now, cut meat, teach, and influence others to share knowledge. 
Worked as meat cutter for 8 years before becoming inspector at age 23. 
Were no inspectors in meat processing plants until 1968/9.

Change in health outcomes of meat industry because of inspection. Was 
need for inspection, some people saw industry as money rather than food 
and didn’t always protect food well enough. Necessary, like laws for 
speeding, just want to stop those who are taking shortcuts. First bad 
experience, called by Montpelier who had woman concerned about meat. 
Showed him package of meat with red fat, so animal had died other than by 
slaughter. Husband came, was upset and told Carl to leave. Started 
investigation, found out farmer had animal that died, buried it in spring, 
hired person took animal back and thawed it and sold it as fresh. Those 
experiences few, but that person saw it as money. Farmer didn’t know, 
farmer’s helper did, and woman was very upset. Felt more comfortable 
about doing inspection after that to protect people. Also, people come in and

complain about regulations and Carl tries to help them get animal 
slaughtered and processed they way the farmer wants it, even selling on 
farm and getting them a logo. Build relationships with local farmers, don’t 
want to injure the industry, just want to help farmers get the business they 
want. Doesn’t want regulation to be intimidating, wants it to be helpful and 
get people to buy direct from farmer. Regulated industry, saw need for it, 
didn’t always understand rules, but now tries to make it make sense for 
farmers. Some producers start out with only one animal, gives Carl chance 
to give back to people whereas before just had to follow a rule book. Always 
supporting cause for regulation and the need to have it enforced. Try to 
explain rather than just point to the rules. 
00:28:45-00:30:19 
Employed by state of Vermont, first state in Union to provide state 
employees as meat inspectors to do federal work. Certified in 1984 as 
federal inspector for meat, poultry, import/export. Everyone was trained 
for whatever was needed within Vermont.

Normal day at age 15 was cutting wholesale parts for further processing. 
Also had retail people looking for small cuts. Had varied responsibilities and 
cuts. On Saturday, 10 people worked to wait on customers coming in for 
small cuts. In evening, could cut custom meats if animal was slaughtered 
under inspection. Was very busy given size of Vermont. Slaughterhouse 
connected to was largest in New England at the time. Shipped a lot of 
product south and west of Vermont to be processed into other products. 
Last 6 months worked in mainly retail shop, then went into inspection. At 
Carl’s current business, thinks of it as a service, works for the owner of the 
animal. Slaughters, processes, and sends some to distributor if needed. 
Natural fad came, then organic, now local growing most. Field calls of 
people looking for local meat products, direct them to farms selling direct. 
Non-GMO also important to people. Slaughterhouse just got organic 
certification this week, because more interest now than before. When came

here, quadrupled the business and had to start turning people away. Trying 
to build larger slaughterhouse to accommodate more people. Wants to train 
more people, currently work with Hannaford Career Center in Middlebury 
to train new people in meat cutting classes/lab. Wants to do more of that 
and make it more formal, open program to out of state folks too. Now 
certified to process organic animals to maintain organic credit of animal. 
Organic animals have to be kept separate, must be fed organic hay or grain 
if they stay overnight, and must stay together when killed. Must be 
processed first in morning as lot, then wash and go to next lot of animals. 
Everything else the same, cleaning materials included. Had to get organic 
seasoning company because were buying from commercial company before 
for value added products. Looking forward to maintaining organic 
certification, gives producers opportunity to maintain premium for organic 
animals. 
00:38:31-00:46:34 
When started current operation, previous owner did mainly custom work 
for owner’s own use. Last owner was 72, didn’t want to continue because 
felt there were no more farms left in area, but Carl thought the opposite. 
Many slaughter facilities are seasonal and close mid-winter to summer. Carl 
wanted to have year-round operation, searched for farms doing year-round 
slaughter by promising spots during busy season. Took business from 
$230,000 and by year 3 over $1 million gross sales. Quickly realized that 
facility was old, soils not conducive to waste, not septic system, single-phase 
power, electricity was very expensive. Upgraded power system, contribute 
to land owner, share septic system fees. Also moving towards new building. 
Very steep learning curve in slaughter industry if you haven’t done it before, 
but value their experiences and relationships with producers. Have 100% 
satisfaction guarantee, will work to make good business on both sides. 
Please to work with hard working farmers, salt of the earth folks, people 
don’t rush into livestock. Identifying year-round market is very significant

to business. In past has always been seasonal to take advantage of summer 
grazing and fall cool temperatures for storage. Now, consistent need and 
desire for quality products year-round. Helping young starting farmers to 
understand how to raise and slaughter animals year round. Key is matching 
clientele with producers, want to help industry flourish. Discouraged 
customers don’t tend to look twice in same location for product, so want to 
provide consistency. University of Vermont and other institutions can help 
with this kind of education about livestock diversification and consumer 
demand. Doing well, but can do better by listening closely to consumers. 
00:46:34-00:55:11 
Vermont went from 20 slaughterhouses to 6, then was big push for more 
slaughter capacity and are now new facilities. Carl was booked with waiting 
list, which was not great for farmer because needs slaughter on time. 
Currently have work but no waiting list, working on modern packaging. 
Need to fill coolers to stay in business. If can’t get product processed on 
time for producers, both industries hurt. Don’t want overabundance of 
slaughter, but need slaughter. Only time will tell how successful the 
industry can be, but unless the animal numbers come up, will be difficult for 
all slaughterhouses to survive. Currently have cattle population at 1951 
level, while human population and exports have gone up. Opportunity to 
raise and slaughter cattle is available, need to increase cattle numbers to 
satisfy increased processing facilities. More of a buyer’s market if you need 
slaughter, but not a bad thing, competition okay. More prevalent in last year 
than before. Processors want to be able to provide value added products 
and packaging, but starting slaughterhouse is not easy with increased 
numbers. Carl relying on quality service to entice customers for slaughter. 
New plants that fail will hurt industry because sends message that you can’t 
survive in this industry, and farmers reliant on industry will be hesitant on 
increasing herd incase more processors shut down. People mean well, many 
people impacted, keep 12-17,000 acres open for cattle when industry is

successful. If slaughter opportunity wasn’t here, wouldn’t be conserving 
land the animals live on. Want new people to be successful because that 
means everyone is successful, just need to make sure the working landscape 
works.

Carl provides a service to make sure you can get product to market. If you 
don’t have a market, try to connect buyers and sellers. Sees producer as the 
customer, doesn’t want to compete with the farmers. Isn’t in business to 
grow and sell animals. One farmer advertises on internet, invites people to 
visit farm, already has animals sold before slaughter. Meets people with 
product on trailer, so Carl understands he needs to perform at this 
producer’s needed level of quality. Needs to get animals slaughtered on 
time. If something goes wrong, all levels of system hurt from producer, 
distributor, consumer, retail outlets, etc. If need to stay after hours to get 
things done on time, will do it. Farmers come who went to other processors 
and were not given promised slaughter dates. There is a tremendous need 
to do what you say you’ll do. Others are trying, but sometimes it doesn’t 
work.

Buyers range from distributors who call to fill orders. Some farmers have 
their own market, but need to know Carl offers skilled work and USDA 
inspection. Buyer, seller, distributor, and slaughterhouse need to work 
together. Try to connect as many people to markets as possible, even taking 
people from NY. Trying to modernize facility as much as possible to increase 
efficiency. Small plant, bought it in 1977 after owner wanted out of industry, 
owner talked to Carl when Carl was meat inspector and 28 years later 
bought it. Location was perfect for slaughterhouse, on dead end road so 
won’t bother people, sits between tow biggest beef counties in the state. 
Many people trying to start slaughter, more animals coming into slaughter. 
Farmers want to grow, Carl wants to help them. Try to tell people to book 
animals in advance, if get too busy have to turn people away and want to

help grow small businesses. It’s a significant commitment to raise animals 
and not get them into slaughter. Need balance to spread slaughter season. 
01:08:25-01:14:10 
Do retail cutting and value added products, ranging from small packages of 
cuts to sausage, sausage links, curing, smoking, cooking. All help farmers get 
better income. Carl’s plan to offer more value added in larger new plant. 
“There’s nothing in the meat industry that’s inexpensive.” Equipment very 
expensive, so have to charge more to farmer to cover cost of machinery, but 
farmer also makes more money selling value added product. One person 
from MA visited processing plant and farm just to know where their meat 
was coming from. Farmer gets credit for quality of meat, Carl gets credit for 
quality of cut and packaging and processing. Not many customers like that, 
but makes you feel good about hard work and expertise. Slaughter and 
processing is an agricultural component, can’t separate it, live animals don’t 
get to consumers without going through slaughter. Legislature views it as 
commercial and industrial activity separated from agriculture. “You can’t 
get any closer to agriculture than what we do.” Compost, blood, bones, fats, 
hides, all used from processing.

Current value added services include processing down to retail packing and 
three different kinds of sausage. Next step will be sausage links, 
experimenting with casings now Will make breakfast, hot, sweet, and Italian 
sausages. Also soft pressed sausage patty, and machine is very large so need 
bigger space for it. Need to be conscious of older workers, don’t want to 
strain workers more than already doing. New facility will also feature 
curing and smoking. Cooked product can get contaminated in air, so will 
connect producers to other facilities to cook product. Sausage recipe Carl 
knows is his own from his mom, but at the plant uses recipes based on 
customer feedback of what they like. Some customers bring in own 
seasoning, others ask for specific changes in seasoning. Moving forward, 
would develop own recipes. Food television inspiring people for more

interesting combinations of flavors, and want to support that. 
01:17:41-01:21:55 
When farmer brings in animals, Carl slaughters and sells the hide as part of 
slaughter. Head, feet, and intestines picked up by company free of charge. 
Some farmers ask for bones, but anything farmer doesn’t want goes into 
barrels and same company picks up the waste to be rendered. Carl doesn’t 
get anything for those products. Most producers take back marrowbones 
for people to eat, make stock. Many parts used to be thrown away are now 
getting eaten, like pig ears and pig feet. More unique products being sought 
after. Rendering of other products turns into fat, meat meal for animal food, 
bones as calcium for chickens, bone meal for fertilizer, yellow fat for chicken 
feed. Anything going into ruminant feed not happening anymore. Fertilizer 
and animals feeds plus hides for leather most prominent. Downturn in 
economy had fewer expensive cars selling, so hides became worthless and 
cost more to salt them than to sell them. Economy came back and hide 
prices went back up, helped business survive. Everything has a use, and 
hides are part of bottom line. Hide buyer sells to another hide buyer, 
eventually a tenner probably outside the country.

Carl’s employees have been in industry for 30 years, newest employee is 
young lady who is instructor for Hannaford Career Center, learned as 
student with them. Carl’s wife works with him, was florist for 30 years, son 
working there since young age. Main cutter is older, a father and son pair of 
previous owner integral to business. Have had fairly low turnover in 
employment, not as bad as other businesses. Carl likes to give people 
freedom as long as they have desire to learn. Majority of employees have 
been long term. Older brother retired, brother in law works now. “If you 
aren’t born in it, you still have an opportunity to be in it, but the influence 
has to be from people that have been in it. Otherwise they just don’t 
understand the level of responsibility that there is to produce this for the 
industry.” Carl wants to help train people and give necessary exposure to let

people decide if they want to go into the business. Likes working with 
people from correctional facility, people make mistakes and some really like 
to work with hands. Carl likes to offer a chance for people to turn around if 
past is non-violent. Never know if someone will succeed unless you give 
them the chance, growing up with leg brace Carl recognizes the importance 
of giving people a chance. Can’t put yourself on a pedestal, need to work 
with people. Also works with war veterans, if they think they can do the job 
that’s good enough for Carl. The industry is difficult and it’s a hard job but 
people may be interested if given the opportunity. Will keep older staff until 
they want to retire, then hand over to younger and newer people with 
enthusiasm. 
01:27:27-END. 
Seeing your work completed and in pieces gives good sense of satisfaction 
and reward. Having that attitude going into it that end product is rewarding 
is key. Carl is very passionate about what he does, maybe because he can do 
it but also because there is a need for it and the reward is from satisfying a 
customer for something Carl didn’t grow. Reward is providing a needed 
service in a timely and quality way to help producers grow their own 
businesses. Reward is working with everyone, from farmers to good people 
learning the business. “Heaven’s not ready for me, Hell’s afraid I’ll take over, 
so I’m gonna be here for a while. So while I’m here, I’m gonna do the best I 
can to try to influence this in a way that works for those that come in 
contact with us. That’s my motivation.” Learned that from family. “Don’t 
ever give with an expectation. If you do, you can be hurt. But if you give 
without an expectation, you’ll never be hurt.” We do our best, but always 
looking to improve, and putting your best face forward. Part of what 
attracts employees, but have to bring their own enthusiasm. Very lucky to 
have the staff and business they have.
