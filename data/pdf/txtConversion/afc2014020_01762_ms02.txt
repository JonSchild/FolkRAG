Note:  When Lorrie refers to Cathy, she is talking about Cathy Martin who is a daughter 
in the Brown family and who now runs the Brown farm in Windsor along with her father 
and uncle. The interview takes place at the Brown’s Harvest pumpkin and vegetable 
stand where Cathy’s daughter Drew is behind the register listening to the interview. 
 
 
00:17 I grew up in Windsor.  It was the thing to do. (1972-1976) When you turned 14 
you were able to be a farm worker. You would call. There were two farms in town and I 
really wanted to work for the Browns. So you would call and ask for a job. At 14 it was 
an awesome job. You earned hourly money as opposed to just babysitting.  I called 
Mrs. Brown and asked if I could come work and I started working the summer I was 14.  
When you begin as a girl you are a leafer. You take the leaves out of the baskets and 
provide the sewer with leaves. (The boys all worked in the fields) You’d start with one 
sewer and then two and sometimes more than that. They are sewing non-stop. You 
have to have extra piles of leaves on the side. They should be able to keep sewing. As 
their pile gets low you slide another pile in the first 2 or 3 days I worked I probably went 
home in tears because it is really hard. It is hot and humid and you are in the sheds 
and it is physically exhausting but after that you are in the best shape you’ve ever been 
in. We’d go home take a shower after working and it didn’t matter how hot or humid it 
was I could do anything.  I probably leafed the entire first year. Then I worked up and 
was working for 4 sewers and I was running putting leaves, running. Then I started 
sewing. We also did work in the fields in the beginning. The girls would come out and 
help tie when the tobacco was very small. We’d put a string and a special way that we 
would loop it around the stem so that it would stay loose and tie it up to a wire. It was 
all shade grown tobacco. Tobacco nets flowing.  
 
3:15 When I was under it. When I was tying it I can’t remember if the nets were up. As 
time went on and the plants would begin to grow we would wrap the string around the 
plant without touching the leaves so that it continued to support the plant as it grew. 
Then the pickings would start and then we’d go in the sheds and then we’d start. The 
girls did not pick. The boys did the picking. After tying we were in the sheds sewing.

4:17 The population was just kids. High school and junior high school aged teenagers 
who I went to school with. It was my high school class. Then we’d come together at 
lunch time. The boys would come int. All along the fields they’d have water barrels that 
are painted silver, we’d have water breaks. Then we’d meet at lunch time and sit, we’d 
tape our fingers when we sewed because you would pull the string to tie around the 
lath and then the workers would take them to hang the tobacco up in the sheds so you 
would be pulling the string and it would cut your hands to shreds so we would tape our 
fingers, we’d redo our tape and socialize and sit with our friends. We’d freeze soda at 
night so that at lunch time it was still cold and we’d eat and then we’d go back to work 
for the next half of the day. It was awesome. I loved it. There were some that came 
and said This is too hard and they’d be out of there I’ll go work at Dunkin Donuts but 
you couldn’t at 14. By the time you were 16 you could. 
 
5:45 (Did you also work with some immigrants?) I am pretty positive that when I was 
working it was primarily people from Puerto Rico. They basically did all the farming and 
they were up in the rafters. The kids were not in the rafters. When we’d fill up our racks 
with the sewn tobacco they’d be handed up to the workers up in the rafters. We were 
inside the sheds when we sewed. Both doors would be open. And we’d be standing 
inside sewing. It was amazing. 
 
6:45 It is hard to explain sewing without a machine in front of you. You have piles of 
leaves facing this way, the machine has two clamps that came down. You’d put a lath 
down on one end and tie your string on the other end, you’d thread the machine. The 
pin or needle would saw through it and take the string with it. When you came to the 
end you’d pull the string. Take it out of the pin and tie it around. Two leaves at a time. 
You couldn’t be looking at your leaves. There were different speeds that you could set 
the machines at. You had to get in the rhythm of it and be constantly sewing. You’d be 
chatting and you’d be able to socialize and talk to a certain point. Sometimes the pins 
would break. Then you’d hear people say, “Broken Pin!” 
 
8:30 There were a certain amount that you were supposed to put on a string and you 
were not supposed to punch your fingers through them. This is expensive so you were 
supposed to be very gentle and you were supposed to touch the stems. There were 
people who didn’t keep up, people who didn’t care if they put their fingers through the 
leaves. But there were shed bosses who would walk around watching for that. If you 
saw a string with 8 leaves it would be quite obvious that this wasn’t ok because then 
someone would come to buy the tobacco and they don’t want a string with 8 leaves 
and fingers punched through it. There were shed bosses that I worked for and Cathy 
was actually a leafer of mine in the beginning. I was never a shed boss. When I had to 
leave high school I came back that summer and I felt so comfortable here. I knew it 
was a summer job. When I had to get a job I was so sad. Shed bosses were older than 
me.  
 
10:17 To me it was good money. At the end of one summer I got myself a stereo and 
this was on top of being able to go to McDonalds or Dairy Queen. At the end of one 
summer I bought myself a ten speed bike. The things that were hot back then. I think it 
3 
 
was about 127.00. The stereo probably had an 8 track. I considered this a job but I  I 
didn’t ever think to ask if there was anything I could do in the off season. This is 
summer and when the summer ends tobacco ends. It wasn’t in my head. This was a 
summer opportunity. Later when I worked indoors I thought I wish that I worked on a 
farm. When you graduated high school someone else would come in they were 14. I 
don’t think that you could get a kid to do it today because it is hard work and you have 
to earn your money. 
 
12:18 I’d give it all up to throw bales of hay. I am too old now. But when I was younger 
to be outside baling hay and earn a living. To be part of the earth. I try to support 
farmers in general. To me we are not connected to the earth. Summer for me was the 
weather wasn’t something you escaped – you lived it. You became part of it and got 
used to it. Now when I bring my kids by to get pumpkins and I smell the tobacco it is 
that sweet smell. It is still a really fond memory. 
 
13:40 I do have stories. Sometimes the boys would find the tobacco worms the really 
big fat ones or they’d find toads, don’t want to know how they died, they’d take things 
like that because they’d be mad that they were out in the fields. Tobacco worms are 
the size of my finger and bright green. They’d lay them inside the leaves. The leaver 
would take a wad a of leaves out and turn them over and you’d be sewing and you’d 
put your fingers right into a toad or a tobacco worm and then you’d hear girls 
screaming and leaves flying. People would sing. Whatever songs were popular on the 
radio. I learned some Spanish. Some learned more than others. There was a friendly 
respectful relationship.  
 
15:30 When you went home, your cloths essentially adhered to your body you were 
covered with black dirt you’d take all the tape off, take a shower and then hang out. 
Walk three miles to Dairy Queen or to get a Pizza. The bus picked us up the next 
morning. Whatever kids came from your area a bus would come and pick us up. 
Cathy’s Dad drove the bus. Early in the morning. We were given a helmet to wear in 
the sheds – a safari looking helmet- and a roll of white tape. We’d have our lunch and 
our helmet, put our lunches down and put our helmets on. I can’t remember where all 
the sheds were. They were all over the place. There were more sheds by the golf 
course. There were times when we’d be sewing and they’d be breaking things down 
and take people somewhere else. Sometimes there would only be 2 or three sewers 
left in a shed.  
 
18:17 I always worked on this farm. It was sort of like Red Sox vs. Yankees. (Cathy 
Martin’s daughter Drew is working the pumpkin stand and is listening to the 
conversation. She asks Lorrie, “Can we be the red soxes?” The other farm in town was 
owned by O.J. Thrall) You had a loyalty to a farm. I did. Older kids than me worked for 
this farm and I had a personal connection to this farm. Once I came and worked here 
my connection became to everyone I worked with. They treated me really well. 
 
19:15 (Did you have some of your first cross cultural experiences here?) Growing up in 
Windsor, more so now than then, but even back then I had a neighbor from Puerto 
4 
 
Rico. Windsor had enough diversity that when I was in Kindergarten and MLK was 
marching in the south I was in school with African American children. So it wasn’t my 
first but it was another experience.  I worked in restaurants in San Francisco. Everyone 
there who spoke Spanish came from Mexico and everyone here was from Puerto Rico. 
It was different but the same and it was easy for me to step right into it.  It was a good 
first job for someone who loved the outdoors, loved farming, loved culture. A couple of 
times I overslept and most teenagers would have said oh well missed the bus, I’d call a 
neighbor and ask if she could drop me off at a shed where we I knew they were 
working. Mrs. Brown was always there thank you for coming and find me a place to 
sew. They treated me so well and I treated them well in return. That is why I would 
never think of going to a different farm. Years later I bring my kids here and I still feel 
so at home here. 
 
21:45 The Browns were always in the sheds. I don’t know Hubble or Eleanor, (Drew 
helps her remember Eleanor’s name) they’d come in every day with hat and a cigar, 
never without a cigar, they’d walk through the sheds and say good morning. Hubble’s 
sister Charlotte she was amazing. Even the kids who didn’t want to work tobacco, 
whose parents were forcing them to, in the sheds liked her. She’d wear her denim skirt 
and her helmet and talk to everyone. And then Cathy’s dad was out in the fields. I 
never worked a day on this farm when I didn’t see at least one of them if not all of them 
at least every single day. That made a difference. 
 
23:30 (Were there any love stories that came out of those teenage years?) Not for me. 
We were warned. We had discussions about that. The boys and the girls were 
separate. But then also the field workers, when the immigrants would come, they’d 
say, “These people are away from their families and they are here for a long time and 
they are working we were here we were to treat them with respect and we are going to 
act respectfully…you know some of the girls…that was the 70’s halter tops, hot pants 
working in 100 degree weather. 
 
24:15 They would begin each season with rules. I remember that one in particular 
because some of the shed bosses would get on the bus and tell us that these are 
really great people and you guys are here to work, and they have a lot to deal 
with  ..the idea was you are not dating, you are not here to form relationships. It is a 
work environment. We’d say hello but it’s not ok to you know flirt a lot. These men are 
30 and we are 14. I don’t know what parents did. Now a days people would say I’m not 
letting my kids do that or their kids would not get up off the couch because they’d get 
their money handed to them.   
 
25:45 Back then it was just get yourself out and work. My mom wasn’t worried that 
anything was going to happen to me. Get on the bus and earn some money. They 
never asked me about work. It was the same with school. Back then it was go to 
school. I am not helping you do your homework. And then the talks with being careful 
with the tobacco and doing what you are supposed to do. You could make piece work. 
So if you sewed really fast and as you got better the incentive was you earned more 
money, after a certain amount of laths you’d be on piece work and you could get extra 
5 
 
so many cents every lath you sewed so you could get up and above your hourly wage. 
I was psyched and motivated you either got really good at it, you did or you didn’t. It 
just got me in such great shape but I don’t think that I could do it now but I’d give 
anything to sew just one or two to see if I could still do it. I couldn’t stand there for 8 
hours though.
