Henry Reed, Glen Lyn, Va. — 6/18/66
Mr. Reed is 82 years old. Born in Monroe Co., W.Va., in Rich Creek area. Lived in Red Sulphur Springs (Monroe
Co.) for a while when he was young. Also lived in other places in W.Va. later. Evidently picked up most of his tunes
from Monroe Co., W.Va. — Giles Co., Va. area. From a musical family. Made some effort to learn to read music
while in Red Sulphur Springs, where he picked up a few pieces from sheet music, but let his music-reading lapse
later.
He plays with fiddle under chin, holds bow at frog with little finger under the screw.
Besides the tunes I recorded he played Red River Valley, Hop Light Ladies on harmonica, Cripple Creek, & others.
He mentioned that he could play Bonaparte's Retreat & Lost Indian in different tunings.
Learned at least one tune (#31 ?) from Mr. Hipes, from W.Va. (Cabell Co., near Huntington).

Henry Reed — born in Monroe Co., W.Va., not far from Peterstown (i.e., near Va. border). Lived in or near Red
Sulphur Springs when he was young, started to learn to read music there but soon dropped it (fr. one Hugo Stein,
a German). Picked up many if not most of his tunes in his youth (started when he was 7 or 8), learned tunes from
members of family & from neighbors (fr. “East Virginia” & N.C., he says).
During his adult life he worked spells in several places in Va. & W.Va. Worked in mines & mine towns a little
while, mainly in McDowell Co., W.Va. (Keystone, etc.). Worked for Appalachian Power in Glen Lyn, Roanoke,
Logan, & other places. Worked for Celanese in Narrows a little while. Retired fr. work age 71. Now keeps a sizable
garden & some chickens.
He is known in the area for his banjo picking as well as fiddling, but no longer plays (since he lost his banjo in a
fire).
Hardly any of his tunes were picked up from radio or phonograph.

He says that they all — or most of them, anyway — came to Monroe Co. from “East Virginia” & considers his
repertory basically “East Virginian.”
He has lived for short periods in other areas & picked up tunes elsewhere. He picked up several tu Floyd & Franklin
Co. (Va.) tunes when he was in Floyd Co. He learned some tunes in & around Logan, W.Va. At least one of his
tunes comes fr. a Mr. Hipes of Cabell Co., W.Va. (Huntington area).
He says he heard his version of “Billy in the Low Land” in Floyd Co., Va.

Henry Reed — May 6, 1967
Notes:
Henry Reed's brother, A.J. (Andrew Jackson) Reed, who was older than he & helped teach him tunes, used to
play Durang's Hornpipe, & Henry played at it, too, tho' he has now forgotten it. But he says nobody in the area
played Sailor's Hornpipe. He used to play a version of it from a record of Al D. Romane. (Romane also had a rec. of
Durang's.) So the sum of locally played hornpipes is Fisher's, Ricketts', & Durang's.
One of the 2 tunes he learned in Cabell Co. (fr a “yellow nigger” fr. Texas) is that schottische that begins
[a.d.f#.a.b.g.gf#g.].
The title of that Texas tune he once tho't was something like “Granny” is Newcastle.
Tunes I asked him about:
Lady of the Lake — rang a bell. He tho't he used to play it.
Gray Eagle — he knew it but couldn't think of it
Devil's Dream — he knows it but never worked on it because he didn't care for it. Confused it w. Money Musk

28th of January — tune sounded familiar to him, but title only reminded him of 8th of January — used to play
Jake Gillis — has heard it as a banjo piece
Fine Times at Our House — neither title nor tune familiar
Cuckoo's Nest — unfamiliar
Boatman — has heard it
Such a Gittin' Upstairs — used to play it some.
He played an unrecorded piece beginning like Cabin Creek
That unnamed tune wh. he contam. w. Frosty Morning last visit is a 1-part tune fr. East Virginia.
He once had a collection of c. 200 records but they went in the fire (if they hadn't been borrowed & never returned),
along w. his Stainer violin (Petersburg?) & his banjo.
Fiddlers in Monroe Co. when he grew up:
Ballard Carr (very good), Bill Carr, Harvey Carr — the family moved to Ohio long ago. — Dr. Dunn. — Mr.
Sturgeon
Asa Dillion, Quincy (Quince) Dillion, Will Dill(i)on
A.J. Reed accid. killed himself w. gun in Keystone.

Notes
H.R.'s wife's maiden name was Spangler. She lived in Monroe Co., tho' I believe her people came from Greenbrier
Co. They were married c. 1905.
I asked him about “Hound(s) in the Thorn Bush.” He said it was another name for “Forked Deer,” used by some
of the older fiddlers. But he considered Forked Deer the right name. He said that Forked Deer was one of Quincy
Dillion's pieces.
Fieldnotes http://www.loc.gov/resource/afcreed.reedfn01
Facts of H.R.'s early career: He went to Keystone when he was young (14, I believe) and returned to Monroe Co. a
year or two later. After he went out on strike against Appalachian Power (c. 1900-1905) he went down to the coal
fields for work. He & his brother were at Crumpler (McDowell Co.) for a while & played together regularly. He
also worked at Glenalum (Mingo Co.), near the Tug River, for a short time at some period of his life. In Va., he has
worked in Floyd, Roanoke, & Radford (Claytor Lake dam) for spells — Floyd the longest.
