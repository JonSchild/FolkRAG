THE MUSIC Sf
l .
 
i
io; Aase's
 
You have found out lately that  music can re.11y tell you
 
deal if you only listen carefully .
You have had little  i
eo:
 
hat told you  about dancing and skipping, and others that told
 
you about rocking  and swaying and swinging and others that told
 
ou about galloping, and others that told you about marching.
 
those pieces told you about  motions of some kind and made you
 
c
.0
1 n:  to make those motions yourself. They all made you want to do
 
l
r
O,Ie"
-hing,
 
J
ow,tbere i
s a kind of music that, instead of making you
 
up and want to do something, makes you want only  to be
 still a
 
'
:pten as you do when a beautiful story is read to you. Soinetlr
 
'
ouch music almost tells you a s
ry and sometimes it only givc
 
he feelings  that different kinds of stories give you. L
.
 
:
oever tells you every little thing as the story book does; i
t
 
usually tells you only the most important thing; but it tell
 :
 
oo beauti f
ully  that you never f
orget .
 For instance, music coui
 
ibly tell you that a little robin flow against Ted'
 
W0
1:
 !
'1]led; It cotld not tell you that Ted took it to Luu
::'
 
.nd
. that he and Iaoy dug a grave and buried it under the lilac b::
 
ut it could tell you that "the saddest thing happened"; and 1
 
ould tell you  so beautifully that you would feel the eadne
 
:
j
 deeply than when you heard the story, for music oar
: o. 
t
colings even more  plainly than words
,
 can speak.
 
.i we are going to have a peloe of music that teals abc :
 
ig sad
., and when you have heard it you will underatan
 
C
 mean by scying  that musiw speaks to your feelings, for you wi:.
 
;

that m de you f
