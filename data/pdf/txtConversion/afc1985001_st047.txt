I Rode Southern
I RODE SOUTHERN 4111-A1
Merle Lovell Shafter, 1940
I rode Southern I rode L and M N I rode Southern I rode L and M N And the way I've been
treated I'm goin' to ride the rails again.
The way I've been treated sometimes I wish I was dead The way I've been treated
sometimes I wish I was dead Cause I've got no place To lay my weary head.
I rode Southern I rode L and M N I rode Southern I rode L and M N And the longest one I
've ever rode It is now began.
I'm a ramblin' man, I ramble from town to town I'm a ramblin' man, I ramble from town to
town Been lookin for two blue eyes And now they been found.
I gave her my watch, and I gave her my chain I gave her my watch, and I gave her my
chain I gave her all I had Before she let me change her name.
