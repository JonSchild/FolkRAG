EH: Emily Hilliard 
TT: Tim Thomason 
 
00:00 
EH: Alright. It's February 28, 2022. I'm in Princeton, West Virginia. Why don't you introduce yourself 
and tell me your name, the year you were born and where you're from? 
 
TT: I am Tim Thomason. I was born in 1958. I am from Princeton, West Virginia, have lived here all my 
life. 
 
EH: Tell me how you became interested in being a rural mail carrier? 
 
TT: (laughs) My brothers were going to take the postal exam that was advertised in the local newspaper. 
They were having it in Bluefield. And I was working production work at the time at the Radford Army 
Ammunition plant, and just decided to just go ahead and take the test with them. Of the 4 of us, I was the 
one who actually got called first. I didn't even know what a rural carrier was. Came in, was interviewed, 
and liked what I heard and took the job. 
 
EH: What year was that? 
 
TT: Oh, you're asking hard ones! I think I took the test in '86 or '87 and actually took the job in March of 
1988.  
 
EH: Alright. How did you learn the craft? 
 
TT: (laughs) Well, now there's an academy that we go to. When I went in, you just went over, they gave 
you a driving exam to make sure that you weren't going to kill somebody. Nothing like it is now. And I 
actually worked 2 weeks before I went to that because the gentleman that I was hired to sub for had to 
take a week's vacation. So (laughs) 
 
EH: So it was learning on the job? 
 
TT: Oh, yes ma'am. And the first time I went out by myself, I tell this to everybody because I tell them 
you have to be patient. The first time I actually went by myself, I had a, I'll never forget, I had a 4-door 
Subaru and I had to sit in the middle because you had to reach the mailboxes. Every time I moved my rear 
end, I rolled the back window down! So that was frustrating and then I lost a bundle of flats and I thought 
to myself, if I make it back to the post office, I'm never doing this again. But I did. 
 
EH: Yeah, what kept you going back the next day? 
 
TT: (Sighs) This is going to sound so terribly sexist. The people that were helping me were, 2 of them, 
and one of them is getting ready to retire now--she got there just a little bit before I did. 2 young ladies, 
I'm a pretty good sized guy and I saw these 2 young ladies doing this job and just, and they seemed like 
they love it, and I thought to myself, if they can do it, I can. So a little bit of hardheadedness. 
 
EH: Mmhm. Tell me about your route. Is the route you started with the same one you ended up on? 
 
TT: No. I started out on Route 6 and then learned that one and then I learned the 2 auxiliary routes, which 
at the time were 5 and 8, and then I was able--I actually quit my other job in December of 89 and had got 
assigned to Route 5 which was up in Lilly Grove and then learned another route, Route 4, but then in

April we had a guy retire or quit, I don't remember exactly, and that was the route I inherited in April of 
1990 and it's the same one I delivered until I retired 31 years later. Very rural. Very rural. Like I said, at 
some point about 30 miles I actually go into Wyoming County--not Wyoming--Summers County! Down 
towards Hinton, but it just, it suited me. I didn't have to fool with as much mail as what I call the circle 
routes, and I love driving! So that was the one I kept. 
 
EH: Yeah, could you describe the landscape and the scenery along that route? 
 
TT: (laughs) A couple places, I always describe it as top of the world. You're just up on top of a 
mountain. Again, very rural. Most of them were 1 lane roads, especially when I started. A lot of 'em were 
not even paved, gravel road. I still, when I retired there was still a couple of those one lane roads. Some of 
'em had been widened but on more than one occasion in the winter, I broke snow. Because it is as rural as 
it was and in a lot of places, they didn't have a lot of families living there, it was just not high priority for 
the state road trucks to get out to. But it's just beautiful. 
 
EH: Yeah. Tell me about your typical day on the job to when you first would get there to when you'd get 
home at the end of the day. 
 
TT: (laughs) When I first started, if you had to get out for a package more than 10 or 15 times, that was a 
heavy, heavy day. Because of the shift in the landscape there is obviously not as much First Class Mail. 
Bulk Business Mail is still pretty heavy, in my mind. But the majority of the job anymore is packages. 
Now even on the route when I left, if I didn't get out at least 50 or 60 times, it was a light day. When I 
first went (sighs) there was no such thing as automated mail, automated flats, it was all worked by clerks. 
We probably had 20 clerks that worked in the post office. Maybe even more than that. When I left, I think 
there may have been 6. And some of those were part-time. Everything went through, everything goes 
through machines, there's scanners now, I could go out there and if something happened, they had to find 
me. Now, they know where they am all the time! So, but you get there, you get your mail--I could never 
take the mail to the street. The automated mail. I did it for so long, it was just more comfortable for me to 
do it my way and they didn't fuss at me because I didn't have trouble with time or anything like that. I 
thought at some point that the car could drive itself. But you delivered the mail depending on heaviness 
and lightness. I would start at 7, hardly ever was done before 3 o'clock, especially towards the end, which 
is a good 8 hour day. But a lot of times it was 4:30, 5 o'clock.  
 
EH: Mmhm. Tell me about your vehicles over the years? 
 
TT: (laughs) I told you about the Subaru. And then when I got a full-time job, probably the best vehicle 
that I had for the route, until I got into right-hand drives, was a, the last year they made 'em, a 1990 model 
Bronco II. Looked like a box. But it was 4-wheel drive, it held a lot of mail, and I like to tell people, it 
would climb a tree. Used it for 7 years. Put 200 and I want to say 227,000 miles on it and the engine was 
still good. But the transmission I had all kinds of trouble with. (Sighs) Then I got a Blazer that didn't last 
very long. I mean it was a myriad of vehicles. The first true right-hand drive that I ever bought was a 
Subaru station wagon that was right-hand drive, went to Kentucky and got it. It didn't even have cruise 
control. But it was a great vehicle. Held even more than the other one did, and it was good 4-wheel drive, 
as long as the snow didn't get above 2 inches. And then it started dragging (laughs). It was just...then it 
just didn't work out so I went back to a Honda CR-V. That was a very good vehicle except for I had to sit 
back in the middle. Then I went to a Jeep Cherokee that I bought second-handed for a little while. Then I 
bought a Liberty, Jeep Liberty, that I actually took to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. As just an aside, I spent 
money on my vehicles because I always felt like I spend 6 hours a day in it. It was my office. So I took it 
to Philadelphia, had it converted from left-hand drive to right-hand drive. I wore it out, used it for about 5 
years. Then I got, the first Jeep Wrangler right-hand drive and then I went and traded it and got the last

Interview with Tim Thomason – 2/28/22

Jeep right-hand drive Wrangler 4-door that I retired from. I used it for a little over 3 years and still put 
118,000 miles on that. 
 
EH: Whoa. 
 
TT: So those were the vehicles. There were several. 
 
08:54  
 
EH: Was there a favorite one? 
 
TT: Hmm. Non-right-hand drive, obviously the Ford Bronco II, it was just, it was an awesome vehicle 
and it had a bench seat so it wasn't really that hard sitting in the middle, but I can tell you from hips and 
shoulders, I had to get out of a left-hand drive quickly or I would have never been able to finish. They still 
have a little bit of arthritis in 'em. But then the last one. It was a grey Jeep Wrangler. 4-door.  
 
EH: Let's talk about your customers. What kind of people, what did they do, and the demographics of the 
people you served? And then talk about how you developed relationships with them over the years. 
 
TT: (Sighs) A lot of older folks and I had everything from, how do I put this, underprivileged, that 
scraped by, really, farmed, and then I got to the end of the route which is Haldridge Road and that's 
(sighs) I drove 90 miles and it was the last 7 or 8 miles was where I had 40% of my mail because these 
were very, some affluent people, (sighs) in West Virginia it's really hard to find what I consider million 
dollar homes--out on Haldridge, I could have had 3 or 4. And it was the majority of my customers. I think 
I got along with all of these folks, and if you ever had a chance, I'd love for you to interview some of my 
customers. They knew that they could depend on me. I could, on my phone, I still have contacts that are 
customers. If they had something special, they'd leave a note or if I thought they might not be home, I 
would give them a call. I had customers who lived so far back off the route and you had to go through 
gates and stuff that I would actually call them and they'd meet me at the mailbox. So (sighs), I don't want 
this to sound like I'm bragging or anything like that, when I left, I actually had customers cry. That was 
the rapport that we had. But again, and they could tell literally, they could tell how the mail was placed in 
the mailbox, if it was me or somebody working for me. That was the care I took. But I was proud of my 
job. I really was. Loved it. So. 
 
11:42  
 
EH: Yeah, did people leave you things in the mailbox for gifts? 
 
TT: (laughs) Yes ma'am. A lot of it was home baked goods because again, and it was funny, though, it 
seemed like (sighs) how do I put this? The less privileged they were, the more they realized what I did. 
But yes, At Christmas it was, obviously I never got rich or anything like that, but a lot of them did more 
for me than they should have. I'll just put it like that.  
 
EH: Nice. Are there any stories about you know, helping customers when you come upon them during 
your route? 
 
TT: Not too long after I started on this route, and I found out after I left that this lady passed away. She 
was 83 but 30 years ago her mother was bedridden and her daughter came out the bedridden's 
granddaughter came out and she was choking on a piece of hard candy. And I went in and was able to 
chest pump and dislodge it. I had a lady who had an accident and actually flipped over on her, the top, she

was in an old Jeep, and pulled her, the other lady I think had got out by herself, by the time I got to it, 
and, but a 2 or 3 year old in a car seat. I was able to get them all out. They were fine, scared the heck out 
of me. I mean, and if (laughs) there were times I brought things that I wasn't supposed to. I mean it just, 
you develop, and again it was a whole lot easier to do that in the beginning than it was at the end. And I 
think that was part of the reason. I could have, I told my wife, it was funny, we were talking about this. I 
told my wife, I retired when I was 62 but I do believe that physically I could have went another 4 or 5 
years. I feel, I still feel good and I loved it, but it just wasn't what I walked into (laughs). But I'm sure 
you've heard that. 
 
13:59  
 
EH: Yeah, yeah and I want to talk about that but first what about times when customers helped you, you 
know, when you got stuck or anything like that. 
 
TT: Flat tires. Flat tires, if I had a breakdown (laughs) I don't remember which vehicle it was on, but I 
was going up a hill and the whole exhaust system just plopped out. So it was horrible. A guy came by and 
me and him got a coat hanger and got up and underneath it and wired it up. Literally. (Laughs) This is a 
pretty good one. It was probably 10 degrees and the Bronco toward the end stages, it just had things that 
were going on with it. The fuel gauge didn't work so I'm back in the boonies and I ran out of gas. Thought 
I'd filled it up, but I forgot! Walked about a mile and a half to one of my customers and he got the car, he 
drove me back out there, he put 5 gallons in it and would not take any money for it at all. So if I had 
trouble, I didn't have trouble very long. They took care of me, they really did. Pulled me out of the ditch 4 
or 5 times when it snowed, tractors, even had a horse-drawn carriage pull me out of a ditch one time. 
 
EH: (laughs) Wow! 
 
TT: Seriously!  
 
EH: Was the carriage already out and about? 
 
TT: Yeah! Well, I was going up, one lane road, and the horse came around, the horses, big old horses, 
came around the corner. And I just get over. And when obviously when you get over on a one-lane road, 
it just, he had the horses, he turned them around, put the chain on the front, pulled it out, just better than a 
car could, probably. 
 
EH: Wow. And was he a farmer or was he just taking people on horse carriage rides? 
 
TT: No no, he was a farmer. Hauled hay and (sighs) if you hadn't asked me, I could tell you his...Alan 
Dunnigan. It just takes a minute. Alan Dunnigan retired from the railroad and he just, he had horses and I 
was just in the right place at the right time! 
 
16:03  
 
EH: Did he plow with horses. 
 
TT: Oh yes, some.  
 
EH: That's cool.

TT: Yeah! It was cool. But he had tractors and stuff too. This gentleman, and it was a group of them that 
got together and I think they're still doing it. It's been a while, obviously, but they would get together and 
make their own sorghum. Take cane and make their own sorghum. And they had those horses turning the 
wheels that they had too. So it was. 
 
EH: Wow, cool! 
 
TT: They weren't just for show. 
 
EH: So did they ever give you any sorghum (laughs)? 
 
TT: (laughs) Yes!  
 
EH: Yeah, I'd love to know if that's still happening. 
 
TT: I will find out! I will. Because I will tell ya, it's not until the end of, towards the end of summer when 
they get together to do that... 
 
EH: September 
 
TT: But I'll see if I can find out if they... 
 
EH: That'd be great. 
 
TT: They were still doing it when I retired.  
 
EH: Alright, nice! What about animal encounters otherwise, so domesticated, livestock, but also wild? 
 
TT: All of the above. (laughs) But I will tell you this, in the 31 years, there was only 2 times that an 
animal would not let me deliver the package that I was there for. It's so funny. I retired in April. In 
October we were in the middle of our Christmas stuff and went to a porch that I had a signature 
confirmation, 'cause the package would have fit in in the mailbox otherwise and got on the porch, the 
screen door was open, the front door, the screen door was closed, the front door was open and when I got 
onto the porch, and I knew they had dogs, but a Pitbull right in my face at the window! And I didn't hear 
anybody, so I went ahead and scanned the package, well then, the package said I didn't need a signature 
so I just decided I'm just gonna leave this on the porch and I'm gonna get out of here. About the time I 
turned around and got towards the end of the porch, the door opened. And I thought they're out here, and 
it wasn't them. And it was, I mean his head was (gestures to indicate a large head) and he came towards 
me and I've had a knee replacement surgery so I can't run. And I had the scanner in my hand and he's 
coming at me and I'm staring him down. I get down to make myself lower. He comes to me and he's 
growling, snarling and I know it's not good, and he actually goes up my leg--I had a pair of shorts on--and 
he left a scrape. He got me enough. The only thing I could do was I brought the scanner square down on 
top of his head. And it stopped him for a minute! But he kept barking and he kept advancing. I took it one 
more time and with everything I could, I hit him one more time and I really do believe I concussed him. I 
didn't knock him out! But I think I concussed him because he looked at me again and he turned around 
and walked off. 
 
EH: Wow. 
 
19:08

TT: And I went and (laughs) got myself calm and called my postmaster and told him what had happened 
and we never heard anything else! But I was afraid the customer, but they didn't. They never said 
anything. On my route deer on a daily basis, turkey, I can't tell you the amount of black bear I've seen and 
I actually have a video of coming up around the corner and a mama and 3 babies. The mama and 2 babies 
went down the hill. One baby went up the hill. And I filmed him on my camera, on my cell phone, going 
up the tree, sitting there for a minute and then finally coming off and going down the hill with his mom. 
 
EH: Wow.  
 
TT: And I know it's hard to believe, I actually saw 2 mountain lions. 
 
EH: Wow. That's amazing. 
 
TT: It was. And in all that time, and I hate to say it, I only killed one animal, and it was a deer. And it just 
plopped across me right in front and it was absolutely nothing I could do. But that was the only time. 
 
EH: Wow. How did you see the mountain lions? Where were they? 
 
TT: On the road! 
 
20:12  
 
EH: Really? 
 
TT: Yes ma'am. I (laughs) the first one was coming down the hill and he saw me, it was a snowy day. I 
could take you to--both times, especially with the mountain lions, I could take you to the spot. And he 
saw me and he just kinda jumped through the fence and went down over the hill. The second one, I was 
actually having a lunch. I was eating a sandwich and he's coming down the road and I'm trying to get to 
my cell phone and get it turned on, but he did the same thing. I didn't scare him, not this one. He just 
kinda took a left, went down through the hill and then up through the trees and I could not get a picture. 
But I've got pictures on my phone of bald eagles. I lost a son and not too long after I lost him on his 
birthday, I saw a bald eagle sitting in a tree and I still think it's...but anyway, that's. 
 
EH: Yeah... 
 
TT: Nothing to do with the route, I'm sorry.  
 
EH: No, that's a sweet story. What about things you would take along with you in case of weather? What 
would you have in your car with you? 
 
TT: Especially in the winter I had a collapsible snow shovel. Salt, gloves, (laughs) this has nothing to do 
with weather, but I was following a truck one time on one of the really back roads and there were 3 guys 
sitting in the front. All of a sudden, they stopped right in front of me, a shot gun went out the window, 
and they shot a rabbit up on the hill! (laughs) I'm telling you! It was extremely, extremely rural. But back 
to the weather. Jumper cables, I always kept jumper cables, screwdrivers, those kind of things. Obviously, 
a jack, lug nuts and the whole, you know. But again (sighs) there were times when they would plow 
especially some of the higher elevations that went, I went through the road, literally there were walls of 
snow on my side. So I went through that some.

22:17  
 
EH: Yeah, wow. Did you see changes in weather over the course of your career? 
 
TT: (sighs) A few years ago, and it has been a few years, it snowed on December the 17th and I didn't see 
the ground until sometime in March. Now, that has not happened as much lately, you know, 'til I retired. 
It seemed maybe it got colder, but I don't think the snow was as bad. I'll just put it like that. 
 
EH: What would you wear, you know, summer and winter. Did you have a particular attire? 
 
TT: (laughs) I did. In the winter I would wear, I wouldn't call 'em hiking boots, but they were a little bit. I 
guess over the years I got used to the cold. I couldn't wear gloves, which really damaged my hands in the 
winter, especially when you reach over and put your hand on a mailbox and it freezes to it, which 
happened a couple of times. But just jeans. I never wore long johns or anything like that. And a hoodie. 
Long-sleeved t-shirt and a hoodie. That was mostly. In the summer it was t-shirts and shorts. That was it! 
That was my uniform. Never, what's the word I'm looking for. Never distasteful or anything like that 
because, but and then I wore a badge but I don't think I ever would wear anything that embarrassed the 
post office. I'll put it like that. 
 
EH: (laughs) Do most rural carriers wear a badge? 
 
TT: (sighs) Well, you're supposed to have the ID on you. I don't think most of 'em, but I got a, I was very 
involved with the union, I would go to state conventions, national conventions. And I always had a 
lanyard, so I just put it around my neck. It was just simple.  
 
EH: What about lunch and snacks? 
 
24:22  
 
TT: (laughs) Well sometimes I would take a sandwich with me on my route and for years it was the same 
thing. I don't know if you know where Glen Lyn is, but that was where, it's actually in Virginia.  
 
EH: Okay. 
 
TT: It's actually... 
 
EH: Okay, yeah, yeah. 
 
TT: Okay. I would go down, I would fill my truck up with gas every day because it was just, I hate to say 
it but it was cheaper in Virginia than it was in West Virginia, and they had the only legit restroom on my 
route until the very end when there was Johnson's Chapel Church and I would go in there every now and 
then if it was a necessity. But the only one towards the middle of my route was this place. I would go 
down, it was about a mile off the route and they didn't fuss about that because I always told them that's 
what I was doing. I would go down, get gas, use the restroom, and sometimes buy a bottle of Gatorade or 
something like that. From there 'til my next box was about 7 miles so I just, if I had a sandwich I'd eat it 
then, just, but not a whole lot of snacks. I took a lot of water with me. Drank a half a gallon of water a 
day. 
 
EH: That's good!

TT: Yes! 
 
EH: I should do that! 
 
TT: (laughs) It's a good habit to get into! 
 
EH: It is! 
 
TT: (points to water bottle)  
 
EH: Yeah, right! 
 
TT: See? 
 
EH: Let's talk about how things changed, your job changed over the course of your career. 
 
25:46  
 
TT: When I started, they still give you a start time and even then, you don't want to be standing around 
waiting on mail. The clerks did everything by hand. I will tell you how old I am. I even started in what 
they called a pigeonhole case. It was a wood case, very small slots, 3 or 4 addresses to a thing. Well not 
too long after I took the route, I went to my supervisor Tom Wallace who has since passed away, and told 
him I'd like what we called a city-style case. And I got that. It's the same one I used until I retired. But 
everything was, everything literally was by hand. The flats, the letters, it didn't make any difference if you 
got a hundred letters or a thousand letters, it was what we called hunt and peck. Now you learned your 
case obviously. But if you left a package and weren't able to get it delivered, I'll never forget the first 
notices that I used, it actually had a peel-off sticky back. You peeled it off and stuck it to the case and 
then you peeled off the other and they had the same numbers. Well that was how they numbered them and 
the clerks numbered them in the post office when we brought 'em back, but my attitude was from the 
minute I walked in until I left, if I took it out, I'm doing my best not to bring it back. 'Cause it was the 
Postal Service, I thought it was the service to get it to them so that they didn't have to get to the post 
office to bring it back. So a lot of times I went out of my way. But it was just (sighs) and then as you got 
on them, we got into the automated mail sector segment, which was better than just raw. And then they 
got into the DPS which is Delivery Point Sequence. I just could not get used to it. Now it was easy to 
case! (makes sound of casing mail), but it was just and probably the last, I would say the last 25 years, I 
didn't even mark parcels. I just, of course you went from having a big day is 40 or 50 [parcels] to there 
was times at Christmas I had over 200 and that's on a 90-mile route. But I still never marked anything. I 
just, I did it in such a way that as best I could, other than just size, the, what we call hodds (?), tubs, you 
put the little ones in and they're chunks or spurs or whatever. I always called 'em chunks. You just had the 
next one in line. And then the big ones, when you got rid of one, you just moved the next one that you 
had and I just, I was lazy. I just didn't like marking 'em (laughs) 
 
EH: So you could just remember that people had packages. 
 
TT: Yes. 
 
EH: Wow. 
 
TT: And a lot of times you just had customers that ordered more. If I didn't go to somebody's door one 
day, I checked on them because if I thought, if they didn't order something, something's wrong! But you

just get used to it, you know. And especially towards the end, well no, not even towards the end. I didn't 
case by number. I could look at their name and know where it went. It was just--31 years on the same 
route. They were almost my family. 
 
EH: What about scanners? How did that change? 
 
29:09  
 
TT: (laughs) The first one was a telephone. I'll never forget. And you (sighs) when we first started if you 
had 15 scans a day, that was a lot of scans. Now if you don't have over 100, something's wrong. It's, I like 
to think it's gonna save our evaluated system, you know we're the only, it's the only craft that I know of, 
not so much in the post office as any that you're paid on an evaluated--I can work 6 hours one day and 10 
hours the next day, but I'm still getting paid for 9 hours. So it, I think it's beneficial to the carriers, I think 
it's beneficial to the post office, so I'd like to keep it stay. But obviously the scanner has had to become 
more sophisticated. (Laughs) You hear some people tell it, “They’re spying on us, they're listening to us." 
I mean I don't know how much of that is true. I know they've got GPS on 'em but even that's not 
infallible. And I think as we go along, I think they'll get even more, you know. I think it's good in a way, 
but I don't like to use this, but it's almost like Big Brother is watching ya. 
 
EH: So you kind of feel, or felt tracked or monitored? 
 
TT: (sighs) I guess I did it too long, I never felt trapped. I felt... 
 
EH: Oh, tracked! 
 
TT: Oh, tracked, I'm sorry I thought you--oh yeah, oh yeah. When they can tell where you are just by 
looking on the computer, yeah, you're tracked! But I never--I don't know if I, I probably, I've also been a 
union steward for the better, much better part of 20 years--in fact I still am. But I always looked at it like 
if you have no reason to worry, then you shouldn't worry. And I always tell people this: Deliver mail, do 
whatever you're doing with the thought in your head that somebody is watching you, because 99% of the 
time they are. It's just that simple. So.  
 
EH: Yeah, tell me about your involvement with the union and some of that work? 
 
TT: Well I only worked part time for 25 months. I was so very fortunate and I think there was another 
carrier who came in 3 months after me. I was in March, he was in June. And he worked a whole lot more 
than I did because I had a 2nd job. And when my route came open, there is a part, well in fact, I think one 
of the supervisors if they had had their way, they would have given it to the individual because he was on 
the route that I got--they would have given it to him had it not been for our union. I do believe that if we 
didn't have the union, and I tell everybody this too, we would be literally highway contractors. And I don't 
know if you know what highway contract... 
 
EH: Mmhm. 
 
TT: They do not work for the Post Office, they work for their selves, and I do believe they are, I hate to 
say it, for the most part, used. So the (clears throat) I am a high school graduate from a very small time in 
southern West Virginia. The Post Office, I will say, and the union, have given me the opportunity to see 
things that I would never have seen, to do things that I would never have been able to do. I have been able 
to retire comfortably--I think a lot of that has to do with the benefits that the union has negotiated for us,

and I always felt like when I got enough experience, when I have to represent somebody on a grievance, 
okay, and I'm sorry about that [the sun shining through the window in my eyes] 
 
EH: No it's okay, I'm moving over (laughs) to sit in the shade. 
 
TT: When I have to represent somebody on a grievance, that's the terminology I use. I never defend 
anyone because some things are for lack of a better way to put it, indefensible. My job as a steward is to 
make sure that they follow--if you're going to expect me as a carrier to follow a procedure, management 
should be held to that same standard--follow the procedure. So I just, everything about unions is not good, 
just like everything about the Post Office is not good. You have to come to a happy medium. But I have 
been involved for a long, long time. The (laughs) the last national convention I missed was in 1997 and 
was in Oregon and I had just got married 4 months before and I thought, probably not a good one to go to. 
(laughs) But that's the last one I missed! 
 
34:16  
 
EH: Wow. 
 
TT: Yes ma'am. 
 
EH: Did you grow up with awareness of the union? 
 
TT: Not to the degree that I got involved. My dad was a truck driver, so my dad was a Teamster, and I 
think I learned from him unions are good, unions are bad. Again I think there's a happy medium 
somewhere. 
 
EH: And as state president, what were your duties? 
 
TT: At one time we were, how do I put it, the board was in charge of the steward system in the state but 
then it went to a national system so we kinda lost that. Mostly now it's to make sure that we have 
meetings, district meetings that are scheduled. (Sighs) And really, you oversee the finances of the state 
that are collected that come back to the state from the national. One of the big things to me was 
recruitment. If we don't recruit as we lose or as people retire and move off, you've just got to keep the 
union strong. And you know, there was a, for lack of a better way to put it, a board of control--president, 
vice president, secretary, treasurer and 3 board members in our state--now that varies. And then there 
were 7 districts in West Virginia and in each of the 7 districts you had president, vice president, secretary, 
not a treasurer. We didn't handle money except for at the state level, so (laughs) sometimes it was like 
herding cats. But you do the best you can. But I always enjoyed it and I always felt like in fact I liked 
being the president because I could feel a little bit better than a steward, because sometimes as a steward 
(sighs) I don't want to say you did things that you didn't want to do, but maybe you did things that were 
distasteful, if that makes any kind of sense at all. But I always felt like when I was president, I always felt 
like I had 800 bosses because I worked for them. I always felt like I worked for them, not them working 
for me, because they were paying their union dues. 
 
EH: Right. Did you develop friendships with union brothers and sisters? 
 
37:01  
 
TT: Oh, yes ma'am. That's still going to this day. I've been involved really hard. I was full time in 1990, I 
think I went to my first state convention in either '91 or '92 and (laughs) I haven't missed a state 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Tim Thomason – 2/28/22

convention since then and the last national convention (clears throat) I have been (sighs) extremely 
fortunate. Probably, I've been going to these conventions now for almost 30 years, 25. Of those 25 years 
or so, I have probably been a, I don't know if this will make any sense to you or not, at the national 
convention there are committees that are assigned to people from every state. I have probably been on a 
committee of some kind at least half of the time, probably more. I was the editor of our state newspaper 
for a while so I was asked to serve in the press room. When I was president, they asked me to serve on the 
credentials mileage and per diem for the people who served as delegates, I got to do that 5 years. And 
then even after I stepped down as president, the board asked me to serve on, this was an experience, the 
National Finance Committee. And I actually served on that for 4 years. So, and again I don't, have never 
understood how I got to be so fortunate, just to be honest with you. And now I'm actually on the 
Legislative Committee, so. 
 
EH: Wow. So does that help negotiate the contract? 
 
TT: Well the legislative is more, the board does the contract, the Legislative Committee is, and I can give 
you a for instance. When I first came in, if you didn't use your sick days, you just lost 'em. They were 
worth nothing. I think it was in 2012 it went to where half of them went towards your annuity and then in 
2013 if you had enough of 'em left over, everything that you had left went towards your annuity. Now we 
never thought that that would happen. Well, it did. Well right now the very, very big thing that we're 
working on is the fact that any RCA time that you have as a part-time employee does not get credited to 
the number of years that you work, okay? Actually when I retired, I was actually able to buy back 4 
months of my time, which is not a whole lot, but before I think it was 1989, you could buy back all of it, 
which meant that you could retire better or sooner with a better--well we're working on that now, but 
anytime it has to go through Congress, that's what the legislative committee is for. So it just doesn't 
happen overnight. And it's an interesting thing too. When I had the Jeep Liberty, Congressman Nick 
Rahall actually rode half of my route with me. 
 
EH: Really? 
 
TT: It was interesting. 
 
40:19  
 
EH: He was just curious what the duties were? 
 
TT: We had went to one of these legislative seminars, this was before I was on the legislative committee, 
and he was actually mine at the time, from Beckley, and I said to him, you need to just come down and 
ride with me and he said when? So I got it approved through the Post Office, which was a pain in the butt, 
got it approved through my union, they had a news crew come out and follow us and they did a write-up 
in the local newspaper! (Laughs) But it was interesting! And I think, have you ever rode a rural route? 
 
EH: No! 
 
TT: You really need to do that one of these days. 
 
EH: Yeah! I would love to. 
 
TT: You need to. It's eye opening. There are (laughs) there are people that we're the only contact they see. 
At the very end, one of the ladies that, and I had, she would come across the road, 90-some years old. And 
it was out on Haldridge towards the end of the route. And it always concerned me because she lived down 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Tim Thomason – 2/28/22

a hill and then coming around a corner and we got to talking and I said, Miss Jones, we're not gonna do 
this anymore. And I talked to her son-in-law who lived fairly close. I said we're gonna get a box put on 
her house. And I said all you have to do is, even before they got the approval I did it. All you gotta do is 
show the hardship of how bad it was. So I delivered her mail to her box. It's just, it just made common 
sense. So. 
 
EH: Yeah. What do you wish the general public knew about the work of rural mail carriers? 
 
41:53  
 
TT: We just don’t ride around in the country. My sons, believe it or not, they thought that was all I had to 
do was just get out and ride around in the country. I'm not gonna say it's like digging a ditch because it's 
not like digging a ditch, but when you've driven 90 miles, you've delivered 500 and some mailboxes and 
you've gotten out 50 or 60 times, it's labor-intensive enough that it makes you tired and I don't even want 
to start about Christmas (laughs). That's just a whole 'nother animal. I always thought it hit us right after 
Veteran's Day, November the 11th, it just came in waves and waves and waves. The only good thing 
about it, in December you didn't have a lot of flats because we were put on what they call Christmas 
Overtime and if you worked over your evaluation, which is another whole mess, but it was, Christmas is 
tough for a rural carrier. Christmas is tough for the Postal Service, but it's tough--and then you get the 
weather in on top of it. Luckily the last year that I worked, we didn't have any weather at all until after 
Christmas, so. 
 
 
EH: And you were delivering through a little bit of the pandemic, right? 
 
 
TT: Oh yes ma'am. Yes ma'am. Never (sighs) my biggest aggravation was this (points to his mask). 
(Sighs) When we first started, I'll never forget my postmaster, "I ain't wearing one of them things, I've got 
asthma and all this stuff and I can't breathe in 'em." And then I guess your attitude has to change, and I did 
and I went as soon as, I had misgivings about the vaccine, I think everybody has or, but as soon as I was 
able, I went and got it because my son said to me, "Dad, at your age, you probably better." (laughs) So we 
did! So we did! And I've had the booster as well. But, as far as the work, it never changed because they 
never told us to stay home and we didn't other than the folks who got it and knock on wood, I have not 
had it yet and in the year since, I've probably donated blood at least 3 or 4 times and it's always come 
back negative, so. 
 
EH: Well that's good.  
 
TT: Yeah. 
 
44:19  
 
EH: And there was, was there an increase in parcel volume? (laughs) 
 
 
TT: Oh! From when I...yeah. (sighs) At least, at least 75% from when I started. At least. Like I said, a 
really hard day back then was 40 or 50 and then at Christmas or around the holidays, there were what I 
call the circle routes, but the routes in my office that had LLVs, when they're doing over 300 scans a day 
and then you're carrying mail on top of it, at times it's just--I had a postmaster who came in, Melinda from 
Montcalm, and she's in Linville, Virginia now, I think. But she would come in and she counted our mail 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Tim Thomason – 2/28/22

and somehow we got talking about the job as a rural carrier. She said,  she said, this is a postmaster, "I 
don't see how you do it. If I came in every day and saw the letters, the flats, and the packages staring me 
in the face," she said, "I'd just turn around and walk out." But I think you just get, it's just like everything 
else, you get used to it. And somedays obviously, some days are better than others! There were days I 
wanted to just (sighs, laughs). Sometimes because I had as long of a route as I did, I started at 7 or 7:30, 
and I wanted to be out of the post office by 9 o'clock. And some days, some days because of how much 
mail there was, how much packages there was, the clerks couldn't get the mail to us as quickly as we 
needed to and that was always a frustration. Always.  
 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. 
 
 
TT: And I'm sure you've heard that before. 
 
 
EH: (laughs) A little bit. What do you think the importance is of rural mail carrying, the service, to the 
communities you serve? 
 
 
TT: Well, like I said there are some that that's the only contact that they would have on a day. There were 
people, really obviously not like it was when I first started, but they solely come to town one or 2 times 
maybe a week, maybe even a month. We deliver medicines, and you know, we're not supposed to know 
that but obviously we do. I had (sighs) I was only supposed to go off the route a half a mile and then a 
half a mile back. Well there was a gentleman who was a veteran, and he got signature confirmation mail 
and his box was probably 2 miles from where he lived. I took the medicine to him. It's, again, I always 
felt like if I couldn't provide the service, maybe they'd find somebody who could. I think that's why we 
have (sighs) and it bothers me to get a package from FedEx or UPS, but that happens from time to time! 
But that's why we have competitors, which I understand--you need competition, but I always thought I 
wanted my customers to look at me as the first line. Not the last one! If they had a choice, make me be the 
first one. But I, and I do still think that we provide a necessary service. I know, obviously with phones 
and computers, we're never gonna get as many personal letters, birthday cards, even those things. But if 
we can deliver packages, if we can deliver certifieds, even to this day you still get things that says, 
"Something attached by hard copy to follow." Well we're the hard copy. So. 
 
48:17  
 
EH: Are there any notable pieces of mail or unusual pieces of mail that you've delivered? 
 
 
TT: Not too long after I started, I delivered a body. 
 
 
EH: Really? 
 
 
TT: It was a cremated body, obviously, but yeah. Of course then I was told, one time I had a registered 
and he said it was a $5,000 ring or something like that, so obviously you don't ever really know what 
you're delivering, especially when it comes to what we call accountable certified registered--those things. 
But (sighs) like I said, I always tried to treat even a boxholder that cost a nickel to mail, the same way that 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Tim Thomason – 2/28/22 
16 
 
I did something that cost $100. I delivered a lot of clothing and those kind of things to soldiers who were 
coming back off of detail. I mean, foot lockers, several foot lockers, but it was all important.  
 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
 
TT: And then again, if they trusted the mail service to get it there, I did the best I could. 
 
 
49:28  
 
EH: What do you think the future holds for you know, rural mail carrying and then the Postal Service in 
general? 
 
 
TT: Well, I don't know if you've seen it but like I've said, there's been talk and some in Congress to just 
shut it down and privatize. In fact I even saw, and this was, I don't think this was somebody in Congress 
but it was from MSNBC this week: close the doors, turn the business over to FedEx and UPS. FedEx has 
600,000 employees, UPS has I don't know, but all I can tell you is this. In downtown Princeton, 
downtown Charleston [West Virginia], Roanoke, New York, Philadelphia--you're not gonna have any 
problem at all. But let me take you to Cheesy Creek and see how often they want to go down that road. I 
just, it's the only, it is--we don't take government money, we are self-sustaining. Obviously, we've been 
running in a hole but again that has to do, and because I'm on the Legislative [Committee] and I pay 
attention, we are funding 5 billion dollars a year for health and retirement benefits 75 years in the future. I 
know you've heard that before and I don't mean to sound like a broken record. 
 
 
EH: No, no! This is good. 
 
 
TT: We are the only public company that that's even close to being! They put a burden on us in 2008 that 
once the economy went south in 2008 and then you've got the computers, the emails, the texts, the whole, 
our service, the way it was, kinda went south. And I don't think to a degree we've really recovered from 
that. Now obviously we need to. But I don't think that FedEx, UPS, any of the other delivery services, are 
gonna take places, are gonna take things to places that I did. A stamp, which, a stamp's what now, 55? 
Yeah, 55 [cents]. In some of the places for FedEx and UPS to get there, it would probably run 2 dollars. 
It's just not--if you make it competitive it's gonna be competitive. It's that simple. But I still think it's a 
vital service. I really do. 
 
 
EH: Do you, I guess I haven't seen the latest with the Postal Service Reform Act, the Postal Service 
Reform Act that I think it passed the House and maybe hasn't passed the Senate? 
 
 
TT: Oh, the Postal Reform? (laughs)  
 
 
EH: Yeah. 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Tim Thomason – 2/28/22

TT: You want to see my phone? 
 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
 
52:05  
 
TT: Hold on a second, I'll read it to ya! This is from the Legislative Committee, one of my--the gentleman 
who was our, he is our Legislative person on the Hill. He goes to Senators, he goes to Congressmen. "Hi 
just a quick FYI, Postal Reform in the Senate, HR 3076 is scheduled for a closure vote this evening but 
first a partisan [unintelligible] bill is scheduled at 5:30. If it doesn't receive closure, Schumer will move 
on to HR 3076 probably sometime around 6ish, however with recent events in Ukraine and the messaging 
nature the Democrats may not pursue the bill tonight so the messaging doesn't get lost in the news." And 
then it gives what Schumer has said about it and you know, it is bothering me because I'm sitting here 
with you, I cannot remember what 30--Oh! 3076 in the House is the Postal Reform Bill. Well it passed 
the House, now we're trying to get it through the Senate. So anyway, today he sent this at what time did I 
get it? 2:30. Right before I came in to see you. 
 
 
EH: Alright! So it's... 
 
 
TT: Yeah, right before I came in to see you. 
 
 
EH: ...happening now! 
 
 
TT: Yes it is! 
 
 
EH: Wow.  
 
 
TT: Yep. This is an aside. In January, in the Kentucky-West Virginia District, which is what we are now, 
I think there was a day that I saw 79 total COVID cases in one day. Today there were 8.  
 
 
EH: And that's among carriers? 
 
TT: That's among the whole Postal. Yeah, it's carriers, clerks, everything. But like I said, there were 79 in 
one day. Today there are 8. We had over 1,000 cases in January and I think with this 8 this week, I think 
we're around 30 for the whole week. So I don't know what's going on I just hope it's... 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
TT: For the most part, spent its course.

54:03  
 
EH: Right for sure. Let's see. What has been your favorite part of the job? 
 
 
TT: (laughs) As silly as it may sound, kinda being my own boss. I could deliver as fast, kind of as fast or 
as at my pace, if that makes sense. Obviously, my customers. My co... (clears throat) this is gonna sound 
awful. My coworkers most of 'em, but when you work in a building of 50 or 60 people, there's people that 
irritate you but you just get over that. But I can tell you really, I never had someone as a boss that I really 
had words with that I, that raised their voice to me or I raised my voice to them. I was so fortunate 
because as a steward, I have dealt with (laughs) I have dealt with some of those people that, there's always 
people, and I always called it stirring the pot, that wanted aggravation going on. I never understood it. 
Because I always, I never got anything out of confrontation at all. I never got anything out of hollering at 
anybody. So, I was fortunate at that. And again, the people that you meet on the route that are just, they'd 
give you the shirt off their back if they had to. I've went out when some of my coworkers have got stuck, 
I've pulled more than 1 of 'em out of the ditch, I've even delivered mail on their route for them. Went and 
helped them change flat tires, so it's just, I don't know. It's mostly fond memories. Mostly fond 
memories.  
 
 
EH: Nice. Well is there anything we haven't talked about that you'd like to share? 
 
 
TT: Not that I can think of. Like I said, for a high school graduate with just, it would have been easy for 
me to have stayed where I was at the time 'cause I was, I thought I was making decent money, and I was, 
but I was working swing shift, I had a young family. (sighs) In fact, not too long after I started, I quit 
because I told 'em I could not, and because I was working swing shift, and again it sounds like I'm 
bragging, but I'm not. The postmaster and the supervisor at the time, they came to me and said, "We got 
your letter, we don't want you to quit. You're gonna be an asset." That's what they said to me. And they 
worked around my schedule for almost 2 years until I was able to quit and I had the opportunity to go into 
management. Never the first time. It didn't interest me even this much. I didn't, I didn't, it was just--it was, 
I don't want to sound, but it was just, and I won't say it was easy, but it was, kinda silly, I kinda think it 
was what I was meant to do. It really was. 
 
EH: Mmhm. Mmhm. It was fulfilling. 
 
 
TT: That's the word. Fulfilling. From start to finish. It really was. 
 
 
EH: That's great. Well thanks so much. 
 
 
TT: It has been my pleasure. I hope I haven't bored you too much. 
 
 
EH: No, no, not at all. It was great.
