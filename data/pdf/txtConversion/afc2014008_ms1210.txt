Australian performance g

otally unlike t

t
 was t
erribly hard t

 f
elt culturally very i
gnorant and not k

t

The base l

 g

f Rarotongan y

very energetic but definitely t
een agers.
 
The small o

No dancers/singers/crafts people except Rarotongans participated i

I even

ather r
emarkable speech g

Notes on A Whale Waits
 
Of c
ourse i
t
 i
s
 a
 young whale t
hat i
s
 t
elling
 
t
his s
tory. I
 h
ave
 h
ad r
esponses f
rom a
 Dolphin
 
t
o Ru -
 t
he f
ounder o
f Aitutaki.
 
The "Death i
n a
 Net" r
efers t
o Drif
tnetting
 
a
nd t
he d
estruction t
he whale h
as s
een. The
 
"Radiating Rumble" was when t
he whale
 
passed Mururoa a
nd was s
haken by a
 F
rench
 
Nuclear Test
.
 
The i
nterpretation o
f t
he "giant l
ost s
ea-
b
irds" has had a
 mixed r
esponse -
 none o
f
 
which
 i
s
 wrong. Some h
ave s
aid t
hey a
re s
hips.
 
Te Ariki Reva a
nd Papa Cameron Henry h
ave
 
s
aid t
hat t
his was t
he "Avaiki Air Crash". The
 
whale s
aw t
he p
lane c
rash a
nd t
r
ied t
o h
elp i
t
 
f
ly a
gain t
o t
he s
afety o
f Avaiki.
 
The writer has i
ntended t
hat t
he "giant l
ost
 
s
ea-birds" a
re t
he g
reat o
cean-sailing vaka o
f
 
our a
ncestors. The whale Paikea mis-took t
he
 
s
ails f
or
 wings. He t
ook p
ity on t
hese b
irds t
hat
 
"
could not f
ly"  a
nd t
r
ied t
o guide t
hem t
o
 
s
afety.
 
Now t
he young whale waits h
is t
urn. As t
he
 
i
s
lands g
ather
 t
heirvaka a
nd s
ail f
or
 Ngatangiia
 
Harbour, maybe a
 whale will j
oin t
hem.
 
This i
s
 how I
 f
eel a
 whale might t
hink o

 our
 
g
reat n
avigators o
