tv*I' 
MET HER AT THE MATINEE. 
-Words and Music by—FRANK Itowar.D. 
[Published by Rom- & CADY.] 
lify self I 
dressed all in my best and with some surpIns cash, 
1 
started for the Matinee I 
thought to cut a 
dash. 
The house was fill'd with beaux and belles as happy as could be, 
And to my coat my heart I 
lost while at the Mat-inee, 
My love had curls and teeth like pearls and wore a 
saner hat, 
And when she peeped from under it my heart it went pit pat, 
Among the crowd of beauties there no other could I 
see, 
That would compare with her I 
met while at the Mat-inee, 
CHORUS. 
My love had curls and teeth like pearls and were a 
saucy hat, 
And when she peeped from under it my heart it went pit pat. 
Among the crowd of beatifies thero, ito other, could I 
see, 
That Would compare with her I 
met while at the Matinee. 
Along with other pretty boy" just as the play was o'er, 
I 
took a 
good posish to stare closely by the exit door, 
And as my charmer Caine along I 
made so bold and free, 
To offor her my company home from the Matinee, 
She took my aria and with an smile, as bright as mornini, dew. 
She says' my name is Angeline. now pray sir who are you 7 
I 
said my name was Clarence Charles that she was to me, 
By fur the armrest girl I 
saw while at the Matinee 
My love had *earls, &c. 
We strol'd around an hour or more as happy as two birds, 
In telling her my fervent love, there was no lack of words, 
I 
asked if she was free to wed and if she would be mine, 
She answer with cunning leer, 
I'll tell sonic other time, 
Of course we had to have ice cream fruit cake and lemonade, 
Five dollars I 
was minus by the time the bill was paid. 
Oh! then I 
saw her safely home and there she promised me, 
Without a 
doubt next Wednesday she'd be at the Matinee 
My love had curls, dre. 
We kept up our flirtation often meeting after that, 
Until one day. I 
saw her home, oh ! did not I 
feel flat, 
As at the door a 
man we met, may husband dear ' says she, 
This is a 
nice young man I 
met while at the Matinee, 
MET, tcortaxpirn). 
Sly heart felt like a 
piece of lead, I 
thought that I 
should clioiik 
The husband says " my darling wife so loves a 
little joke." 
Of course I 
tried to laugh the joke I 
could not. see, 
And now I 
shun the girls I 
meet while at the Matinee. 
CIICRUS. 
Now all young men of good advice, just take a 
word or two, 
In forming new acquaintances be careful what you do, 
Dont let your charmers steal your heart until you plainly seei, 
that they'r not like that girl I 
met while at the Matinee. 
FORTUNE IN THE FIRE. 
Sweet Norah, come here, and look into the fire, 
Perhaps in its embers good look we may see; 
Don't come too near, or your glances so burning, 
Will put it clean out, like the sunbeams, machree. 
Just look ' tween the bars, where the black sod is smoking', 
There's a 
sweet little valley, with rivers and trees, 
And a 
house on the bank quite as good as the squire's, 
Who knows but some day we'll have something like the 
Who knows but some day well have something like these ? 
And now there's a 
coach with four galloping horses, 
A 
eoaclunaa to drive, and a 
footman behind, 
That shows that some day we will keep a 
fine carriage, 
And fly through the street at the speed of the wind. 
A. Dormot was speaking, the rain drops came hissing 
Down thro' the wide chimney, the fire went out; 
While inanAlon and river, and horses and carriage, 
All vanishe:l in smoke- wreaths that whirl'd about, 
All vanished in smoke- wreaths that whirl'd about. 
Then Norali to Dermot this speech softly whispered, 
" ' Twere better to do than to idly desire ; 
And one little cot by the roadside is better 
Than a 
palace with servants and coach in the fire, 
Than a 
palace with servants and coach in the fire.* 
THE- PUGNACIOUS PURE. 
A man he owned a 
terrier derg— 
A hohtaile 
onery cuss— 
Awl that there patty got that there ma 
in many an ugly muss ; 
For the man he wits on- his mussel, 
And. the dorg Was on his bite, 
So to kick that dorg-goned animile 
Was sure to raise a 
fight.-
A woman she owned a 
Thomas cat, 
That fit at fifteen pound, 
And other cats got up iind slid 
When that there cat was * round. 
The man and his dorg- came along one day' 
'Where the woman she did dwell, 
And the purp he growled ferociously, 
Then went for the cat like— I 
lie tried for to ehaw the neck of the oat, 
But the cat he wouldn't he ehawed, 
So he lit on the back of that there dorg-, 
And bit, and ehawed, and clawed! 
Oh ! the hair it flew ! and, the purp he yowled:. 
As the claws went into his hide, 
And chunks of flesh were pealed from his back, 
Then he flummixed, and kicked and died. 
The man he ripped, and cussed, and swore— 
A:4 he gathered a 
big brickbat— 
That he would be denied essentially, 
If he didn't kill that cat ! 
But the wont In allowed she'd be blest if he di 
And snatched up an old shot gun, 
Which she fired and peppered his diaphram, 
W.th bird shot number one. 
They toed urn home on a 
window blind, 
And the doctors cured him up, 
But he never was kntiwn to fight again, 
Or to own another purp. 
Folks may turn up their snoots at this rhyme, 
I 
don't care a 
cuss for that ! 
All I 
wanted to show is that fighting dorgs, 
May tackle the wrong Tom cat.

The Music of this song is published by IT. M. Higgins Music Publish

I 
have been to the North, I 
have been to the South 
But in tr.tvling a 
man may afar go 
To th«t jumping off place before he will find 
A town compind wit 
il Chicago. 
If you never have altered your name in your life, 
Nor never did up to the bar go, 
Or else rn't away with another man's wife, 
They won't le% you live in Chicago. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Sodom was some, and Gomorrah was great, 
And in Venice each man was an lago, 
But ittthing out there can a 
moment compare 
With the sweet sta e 
of things in Chicago. 
S , rne people send on by Adam's Express, 
And some put their faith in a 
Fargo, 
But if you woull go to the devil direct, 
You enter yourself at Chic tgo. 
Tile,: won't let it clergyman live in the town, 
On such they have put an embargo, 
Unl-ss he irinks sherry with all his young friends, 
And titen he may stay in Chicago. 
Oh! Sodom was some, &c. 
There the infants are f 
d 
on whisky direct, 
For liquor they all to their ma o, 
And the muley co V gives, as a man might expect, 
Milk punch in the town of Chicago. 
The town with fast ladies and gay gamboliers 
Is as full as a 
ship with her cargo, 
And the very best men it 4 truthfully said, 
Ftglit cocks in the town of C 
icago. 
Oh! Sodom was some, (Lc. 
There all the small boys played at ' poker' and ` cram; 
For mol:t of them did to the war go, 
AM 
they sing that wild song, call d I 
don't cr.ro a— cent,' 
All night in the strvets ti Chicago. 
Yet it cannot be said that the r 
morals are bid, 
Or that they too much below par go, 
For the divil a 
moral the f, Ilcs ever had, 
Who live iii the town of Chicago. 
Oh ! Sodom was sonie &o.

Music by M. 
A. 
RERSANDEZ. 
Your attention I 
ask for a 
while, 
To a 
song I'm going to sing you, 
It's about a 
pretty yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
And she threw such a 
glance at me— 
She was pretty and as sweet as a 
flower, 
Such clothes you neve did see— 
She'd a 
darling little bonnet with a 
flower-garden on it, 
Had the yaller gal that winked at me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my! she looked so sweet and she dressed so neat, 
With her tilting-hoops and pretty little feet, 
As she went skipping along. 
Pretty little yaller gal I 
met while I 
was walking, 
As she skipped across the gutter, my heart went in a 
tiuttsc, 
For the yaller gal that winked at me. 
.1 immediately asked her name, 
And she said it was Lucinda 
She said I 
was a 
stunner, and for life that I 
had won her, 
And married we should be. 
So, I'd dress up, and I'd walk by her house, 
Every afternoon, about three, 
And I'd gime° up at the window for to see my dear Lucinda, 
She's the yaller gal that winked me. 
Oh my I 
she looked, &v. 
Oh! you %hould have seen her, on her wedding day--
She was handsome as a 
Venus— 
When theFarson made us one, ah then! the thing was done, 
And I 
ne,er felt so happy in my life. 
So, I've bowht a 
little place out of town— 
If you go l)), stop in and see— 
You'll be wecomed by a 
wife that's as dear to ale as life, 
She's the viler gal that winked at me. 
Oh ray : she looked, &a.

THE ROY-AL -WILD -BEAST -SHOW.— [CoNcLunsD.] 
The first one is the kangaroo, you'll know him by Ms hump; 
The tlext's the hippopotamus, you ought to see him jump; 
The third's the alligator and he's such a 
one to crow, 
Ile wakes us every morning in the Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The camomiles, & e. 
That pretty thing's the oozley bird, the other one's his aunt, 
The third we call the pelican, the next the pelicant; 
The other one's the solon goose—you musn't call out ho! 
Or you will hurt his feelings in the Royal, Wild Beast Show. 
The camomiles, & c. 
The donkey in the corner with the tiger on his arm, 
Comes from Assyria, where once his father kept a 
farm; 
That billy-goat that's dress'd in pink and walking rather slow, 
Is very horn imental in a 
Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The camomiles, 
The tortoise, famous for his speed, unequal'd by a 
horse; 
The parrot, too, who talks in polly-syllables, of course ; 
• 
The raging elephants that roar when stormy winds do blow, 
Are also represented in the Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The camorniles, & c. 
The next one is a 
mighty ape, indeed, I 
tell you true, 
It's only natural he should " go walking in the Zoo ;" 
Our stock of monkeys, you'll observe, at present is but low— 
They are so plentiful outside the Royal Wild Beast Show. 
The eamomiles, &c. 
The last's the boa constrictor, who eats all he fituls about— 
Why, who's ben fool enough to let the nasty crittur out ? 
lie's somewhere underneath the chairs, hi I 
mind 3 
our legs, 
hullo 
He's very quiek in clewing out the Royal Wild Beast Show.

THE MERRTFIST GIRL THAT'S OUT. 
With laughter and good humor, why, 
I 
pass my time away, 
So, while I'm here 1'11 do my best 
To please you with my lay. 
Then, come along and join my song, 
And raise a 
merry shout, 
To welcome me: for, I'm you see, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
CHORUS. 
Now then, young men, 
Don't be melancholy: 
Atst see, like me, 
If you can't be jolly. 
If any thing goes wrong with me, 
I 
never sulk or pout: 
In fact, I 
am, and always was, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
The gentlemen complain and say; 
I'm such a 
dreadful flirt: 
But if they will make love to me, 
Their hearts I'm sure to hurt— 
I 
really can't help laughing, 
When I 
hear them sigh about; 
For sentiment it don't suit me ; 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now mien, cte. 
The notes and presents I 
receive, 
Would fill a 
basket quite, 
While bouquets rare, I 
do declare, 
Are sent me every night. 
The notes all speak of broken hearts: 
Some mean it, I've no doubt; 
I'm sorry: yet I 
still remain 
The merriest girl that's out, 
Now, then, &A. 
To balls and parties T 
oft go: 
For, dancing I 
admire, 
And waltzing is a 
thing, I 
own, 
Of which I 
never tire; 
And should my partner squeeze my hand, 
I 
know what I'm about: 
it pleases him, and don't hurt n3e; 
la the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, dim, 
OUR GRAND-PATH_EBJEP DAYS. 
A 
song for to please all my kind friends before me; 
I've been thinking, of late, a 
new subject to raise, 
And one I've got and I 
know it will please you: 
I 
am going to sing of our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, men were judged but by merit, 
And those who were sound, got their measure of praise; 
But, now-a 
days, folks judge of men by their money— 
That wasn't the case in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand- fathers days they had no patent leathers, 
Garot-choking collars, or no peg tops pants ; 
Young men didn't go it with two- forty horses, 
Or visit young ladies, at night at their aunt's, 
The boys didn't then congregate on the corners 
To see the gals crossing, on wet slushy days, 
Nor the gals didn't want a 
policeman to help them— 
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand- fathers' days, billiard markers ne'er sported 
Mestache on their lips, or goatees on their chins, 
Nor did six penny barbers, deive out in light wagons, 
Nor did fish-ball waiters wear diamond pins. 
The gals didn't paint, stuff themselves up with cotton, 
They didn't wear hoops, patent bustles or stays, 
Didn't smoke cigarettes, or drink cock-tails at Taylor's: 
That wasn't the style in our grand-fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days married men they were steady; 
You'd not find them out every day of their lives, 
Nor see them out, late, walking home with their cousins; 
They always retired in good time to their wives; 
They had no Champagne- suppers, no little flirtations, 
No trying to go it in various ways; 
Didn't stop in saloons with a 
female acquaintance— 
They had no waiter girls in our grand fathers' days. 
In our grand fathers' days, when a 
man ran for office, 
He did it alone for the national good, 
And not for the dollars and cents he might pocket— 
That is something that, now-a- days, ain't understood. 
The Government, then, was for wisdom selected 
Rebellion hadn't set the Country a- blaze; 
But the people have sworn that our Flag shall float over 
The Union that was in our grand.fathers' days I

I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING, 
TICKLED ME SO. 
From morning till night I'm indulging in mirth, 
I've always been so from the day of my birth ; 
I 
grin like a 
Maltese cat all thro' each day, 
And never feel right unless laughing away. 
My infantile actions were certainly wild— 
All folks said I 
was a 
most wonderful chill; 
And when first short-coated, I'd have you to know, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
CHORUS. 
Ha! ha I 
ha ! ha! ho ! ho! ho! ho! 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
And when, by degrees, I 
had reached man's estate, 
I 
then looked about in search of a 
mate, 
My eyes soon I 
set on a 
girl tall and fair, 
And begg'd that my heart and my home she would share. 
And while so persistently urging my claim, 
She gave her consent, and at last the day came; 
But, when in the morning to church we did go, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
I'm fond of 
game, I'm a 
good one to chaff; 
At all kinds of mischief I'm certain to laugh; 
I 
oft play a 
lark on some innocent elf, 
Nor care thouE,rh the laugh should be turned 'gainst myself. 
once, walking out, saw a 
man in a 
fit, 
To make him come round I 
his ear quickly bit; 
And when he jumped up, knock d 
me down with one blow. 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled rue so. 
Ea, ha, etc. 
My landlord once called for his two quarters' rent, 
But I 
couldn't pa3- it because it was spent ; 
So off to a 
broker he went very quick, 
And vowed he would seize upon every stick. 
Before he could get back, I 
gave him leg bail, 
For 1 
shot the moon, but got caught, put in jell , 
And tho' plae'd in 
limbo " f 
a. what I 
did owe, 
I 
couldn't help laughing-, 
it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha, etc. 
Three times in succession my partner had twins— 
My place to look like a 
sinall school - room begins ; 
Throughout all the day there is nothing but glee, 
For all of them have laughing fits just like me. 
The last time, to add to our family joys, 
To me three presented, a 
girl and two boys ; 
Whet I 
saw the three cherubs all of a 
row, 
I 
couldn't help laughing, it tickled me so. 
Ha, ha. etc.

Not hampered with a

THE CAT IN THE CORNER. 
As Sung by Bryant s 
Minstrels. 
OA, I 
weep for the day when we were torn from wr co 
Our praties and meal and our stirabout pot, 
When J•idy kept everything piping and hot, 
So snug with the cat in the corner. 
Tile pigs and th- dogs with the children agree, 
Lay down on the floor so &cent with straw, 
While the rooster and hen sat perched up a-
vak, 
Right over the cat in the corner. 
Our cabin was tidily covered with thatch, 
It looked like a 
harlequin's coat patch for patch, 
And the door opened nately by rising the latch, 
Wid a 
thong that hung down in the corner. 
With scythe stuck up here and a 
reaping hook there, 
And Paddy's shelalah, the pride of the fair, 
Was stuck in the chimney to season with care, 
Right over the cat in the corner. 
Our windows so clean by an unlucky stroke, 
Had three of the prettiest panes in it broke, 
And we fastened up two with a 
tail of a 
coat, 
And the smoke went through one in the corner.

SWATE CASTLE GARDEN: 
As sung by. Bryant's Minstrels. 
When I ! andel. at Swate Castle Garden, 
d 
just came from the say, 
In 
p ekets I 
had not a 
farthing, 
As I 
stepped out up the B:oadway; 
I 
walked up to a 
lamp-lighter, 
The mystery for to unravel, 
His hair was cut short, like a 
fighter, 
So I 
shouldered my bundle and travelled. 
CHORUS. 
Harrah for the stars and the stripes, 
And the land where we never s:e fogs, 
If 1 
hadn't come here, by the pipes, 
I'd been di.,:ging up turf in the bogs 
Shure the road it was dirty and sloppy, 
Until I 
came to a 
street they call Wall, 
A blackguard shonted, there goes a 
Croppy. 
Whin I 
kiln to the big City Hall, 
I 
axed a 
Dutch barber the way; 
He answered me dunder and blitzen, 
And a 
big old fat Yankee stepped out, 
And made me an American citizen. 
Hurrah for the Stars, to 
The first. time I 
wint out to Chicago, 
The weather it was very warm 
The Commissioners - axed me if I'd go 
And settle upon a 
nice farm. 
No, says I, I'll go back to New-York, 
Where the Politicks they are so pretty, 
Lave your Dutchmen stop here and work, 
But be jahers ni stick to the City. 
Hurrah for the Stars, cte. 
Bad luck to that viTlain from Sligo, 
Shure he tould me 1.is name it was Hubbs 
Io sould me a 
card for Chicago; 
Be my a 
ad, 'twas an ou d 
Jack of Clubs, 
)3ut. I 
musn't indulge in reflections, 
What I've said isn't worthy of note, 
I'll be running for Sheriff next election, 
So step up me brave boys, and vote.

TEDDY REGAN'S SWARM. 
AN ORIGINAL SONG. 
Ton have heard of Teddy Regan, 
How he won his Winnie fair, 
And her fortune, fifty guineas, 
Set them up in business rare. 
For they crossed the briny ocean 
To deal out the whiskey swate 
At the famed hotel d'Irish 
Down in lovely Baxter striae. 
CHORUS. 
Fal de ral de ral de rady, 
Fal de ral de ral de ra; 
Fal de ral de ral de rady; 
Fal de ral de ral de ra. 
Things kept working brave and hearty— 
Proving money makes the man— 
'Till the Dimycrathic party 
Put Ted up for alderman. 
Misther Regan felt the honor 
With a 
relish of delight, 
And resolved to give a 
swarie 
When it came election night. 
Fal de ral, & c. 
With the strongest kinds of welcomes 
Rue de Baxter did abound; 
For throughout that lovely section 
Dimycrats are aisy found; 
There was Levi, the old elo' man, 
Smelling like the days of yore, 
And McTurk, a 
fine Dead Rabbit, 
True and honest to the core. 
Fal de ral, /ce. 
Dan Mcertitsy, tieensed vender, 
In the clam and porgey line; 
Count Muffini, whose hand organ 
Always ground the Muses tine ; 
While, like Hector that bould Trojan, 
When he fought at Bunker's Hill, 
TEDDY REGAN'S S 
WARIE.

ONCLUDE D. 
Mackerelville was represented, 
By the buffer Wall-Eyed Bill. 
Fal de ral, 
Then came in stout Denis Murphy, 
A 
very dacent Soap- Fat Man; 
While Myneer Van Pat McFadden 
Drove up in his garbage-van. 
Teddy gave them lots of welcome, 
And the pipes began to play 
Tunes to set a 
mile-stone dancing: 
Lillerburo and Patrick's day. 
Fal de ral, 
Soon the whiskey done its duty— 
Wall Eyed Bill began the job, 
And with his black- thorn shillaley 
Split old Levi on the nob. 
Dan McCraisy, belted Mut:phy; 
Laid him stiffer than a 
log, 
Cause he couldn't else convince him 
There was feathers on a 
frog. 
Fal de ral, (tc. 
Soon they knocked the bar to splinters, 
Kicked the panels from the door; 
For it was a 
splendid swarie, 
While the whiskey flowed galore. 
Teddy, when the row was thickest, 
With the poker got a 
clout, 
By the howly mule murther, 
Banged his sivin sinses out. 
Fal de ral, & c. 
Ted was dead as Julius Cesar, 
When the row was ended quite, 
And a 
dacent wake they gave him, 
On his own election night. 
And poor Winnie, left a 
widdy, 
Says she's doing very well— 
And though Ted was " Hunkey Dorey," 
That he " couldn't keep Hotel!"

SO 
THE DUTCHMAN'S SLATE. 
A IR—" Enoch Arden." 
Kind friends, you was listen, I 
told - -bu one story 
What happened to me, Lere, one da. 
I 
keep of this city a 
lager-bier saloon, 
And I 
think of that business will pay. 
But my lager run out, and my S,\ itzer-Kase, too, 
And I 
found out, when it has been too late, 
Of you want to make money in this kind of business, 
By dam! you must not keep a 
slate. 
My friend, Gasper Maltz, he called on me one day, 
And asked me for em n 
glass of bier: 
lie drink that, and said: It was bully I 
anudder, 
And then rubs his belly—right here. 
He called for more lager, and Switzer-
Kase, too; 
And then he said : That NN as first rate 1 
When I 
ask him for pay, he do so—mit his eye, 
And told me : Put that Cu the slate. 
Now, I 
don't like that business: and so I 
was told him, 
One clay, when be came mit my store, 
And there T 
s.kw Gasper a- drinking mine lager, 
And huggin' my wife mit the doar : 
I 
t 
ike him shuqt so, mit the slack of his breeches, 
And pitch him right out on his head : 
I 
take down that slate, and I 
break up that business, 
.A.nd den, ten tausend ! I 
was mad. 
THE TILT SKIRT. 
Air, " Charming Young Widow." 
While walking down Broadway, one morning, and thinking, 
Of the funny creations which Fashion has bred, 
As shown by the " Pancakes," the •' Sundowns,,' the " Gkpsies," 
And all the queer things the girls wear on their head, 
I 
saw " Waterfalls," " Puffs," " Rats," "Alice," and cheek "Plumper.: 
Worn by maids, wives and widows, and dashing young flirts, 
33ut, nothing so much took my eye or my fancy, 
As those killing, enchanting, suggestive Tilt Skirts. 
While thinking, before rue, I 
saw, what a 
figure, 
iy eyes were entraned, I 
was dumb with surprise, 
She'd the waist of a 
Venus, a 
bust fit for Juno, 
And the wickedest, killiugest kind of black eyes! 
" She smil'd, such a 
smile ! as before a 
shop window, 
She stopp'd, first to oeep—I was on the alert, 
And as gracefully forward, she stoop'd for a 
moment, 
I 
saw such a 
sight! Oh, that blessed Tilt Skirt. 
What a 
foot! 
What an ankle! 
They set my heart bumping) 
Oh, how my mouth waterd, as she onward sped, 
And I 
follow`d, panting, and hoping and fearing, 
With a 
thousand wild thoughts rushing through my poor head. 
When, all of a 
sudden, she dash'd in a 
doorway, 
And up stairs, she tripp`d—I hope ' twas not pert— 
But who could restrain his eyes from then feasting, 
On all ' twas reYeard by that blessed Tilt Skirt! 
What a 
foot! 
What a 
gaiter! an ankle, oh, dear me, 
It quite drives me mad, but to think of it now, 
And then what a 
leg! sparm'd by such a 
sweet gaiter! 
I 
felt, quite all over, I 
cannot tell how! 
I 
waited, how could I 
leave a 
feast so enchanted, 
Five long minutes pass'd and still on the alert, 
I 
saw her come down, and at each step she tilted, 
And I 
fairly wilted! oh, that blessed Tilt Skirt. 
For a 
moment I 
stood without power to follow, 
' As she daintily tripp'd along, over the " Russ," 
But soon summoned courage, and caught up with my charmer, 
Just as she her fingers held up for a ' bus! 
It stopped. 
The door open`d. 
Iler dry goods she lifted, 
I 
stood in the rush, unmindful of hurt, 
Ye gods! what a 
heaven to my eyes was then open'd! 
As once more she tilted, that blessed Tilt Skirt! 
I 
rushed in behind her, a 
seat took beside her, 
At the end of the street she rose to go out, 
And T 
rose as well, I 
was in such a 
fever 
That really I 
knew not what I 
was about! 
I 
follow'dher, spoke ; she blush'il, I 
insisted 
On seeing her home, and she prov'd no flirt— 
For she quickly consented, and I've never repeated 
The day that I 
first saw that blessed Tilt Skirt.

COUNTY JAIL. 
VOITITTY JAIL. -E
CONCLUDED, 
Good people, all give ear I 
pray, and mark ye all to What T 
srry 
To inv misfortunes, great and F 
mall, come listen and I'll tell you 
J 
used to lead a 
glorious life, devoid of care, devoid of strife; 
Could go to bed and fall asleep, no ugly visions around me creep— 
But, oh! the toots and Cupid gods, they nearly drove me ramp-
ing mad, 
They piped into a 
railroad mail and carried me off to the County 
Jail! 
And when we got to the end of the route, the turnkey turned my 
pockets Out, 
To see if I 
had got such stuff as money, grub, tobacco, or snuff; 
They took me in to try my size, the color of hair, the color of 
eyes— 
They measured me up from root to lip, to see if I 
had but one top 
lip ; 
Then straightway to the yard did go and ordered me a 
suit of 
clothes, 
The kyds came out and did me hail; " Another new cove for 
County Jail 1" 
Then one of them, with a 
roguish leer, says. " My 
jolly old cove, 
what brought you here !" 
What do you think brought me out, what brought me here but 
your railroad route ? 
Then they gathered around me like so many fools, and one talked 
about the rules, 
That each new comer should sing a 
scn,g, or tell a 
tale-God knows 
how long— 
Or they'd break his wind and give him a 
whack, or they'd take 
him down to Black Jack, 
From there they wollop him, tooth and nail, with lin old wet 
towel from County Jail 
As I 
walked out and strolled the yard, thinking my case was won. 
thous hard, 
All at once I 
heard a 
din, the deputy warden shouts " All in 
Then lumbering down the yard we go, like beasts let out of a 
wild beast show— 
7Sorne cracked in mind, and some in wind, and others with acre* 
behind; 
Then one by one we march around the tub to get our county 
allowance of grub, 
'Which blew our ribs out like a 
sail with askilly and whack _from 
County Jail I 
At five o'clock one of them said; " It -is nearly time to go to bed :" 
The truth from him 1- 
-round did creep, for all turned in and went 
to sleep. 
The turnkey bawled as stiff as starch: -"Right about face and 
then quick march!" 
We did, and made such a 
rush like monkeys marching around a 
bush. 
-Snell clanking of clogs, such shaking of knees, such croaking of 
bellys, and clanking of keys, 
Such damning beds as hard as a 
nail, they'd starve a 
poor devil 
in County Jail 1 
At six next .morning up we got, each man was called to clean his 
pot, 
Then through the yard we did lurch, all fell in lino to go to 
church; 
And there such dresses as met my view, one arm was red, the 
other was blue— 
One leg was yellow, the other was gray, and then the parson be-
gan to pray. 
-Ho said that Elijah went up in a 
cloud, and Lazarus walked about 
in his shroud, 
And that Jonah he lived inside of a 
whale, a d—d 
sight better 
than County Jail! 
Service being over, we all got back, and fell in line for skilly and 
whack ; 
We crushed like pigs all in a 
lump—at nine each took his hand at 
pump. 
At ten we raised a 
glorious mill, and smothered each other with 
right good will ! 
At eleven we raised it and quit the house, all felldn line for pans 
of skonse. 
Then if there's a man, no matter how droll, we pop him into 
Pompies hole, 
'Where whack and water-cocks his tail, there's glorious times .

THE PERRIWINKLE MAN.—LCONCLUDED.1 
Sometimes Pm out of luck. 
And my winkles cannot sell, 
But I 
never give up nor on my losses dwell; 
The old proverb I 
repeat, 
As I 
go from street. to street, 
What luck may be in store 
There's no one can tell. 
As through the streets T 
cry: 
" 
Periwink I 
periwink ! who'll buy! 
From Pegwell Bay, fresh boird to-day, 
A half a 
pint for a 
ha'p'nny." 
There's the question of Reform 
Has been raising quite a 
storm 
Among the people ; and Pm persuaded quite 
That, if taxes we must pay, 
We're entitled to our say; 
If we're workmen we are Britons, 
And we mean to have our right. 
For happy indeed am I, 
As through the streets I 
cry: 
" 
Perriwiuk! periwink! periwinkI who'll buy/ 
A 
half a 
pint for a 
ha'p'nuy." 
Some day I 
may be seen 
As purveyor to the queen, 
The Prince of Wales and Royal Family, 
Making bold enough to ask, 
(Taking pleasure in the task), 
If her Majesty would like 
Some winkles for her tea. 
As through the streets I 
cry: 
"Periwink I 
periwink I 
who'll buy ? 
From Pegwell Bay, fresh boll'd to- day, 
A 
half a 
pint for a 
ha'p'nny-." 
I'm contented, now you see, 
With whate'er my lot may be, 
Taking all my troubles with a 
cheerful air; 
For life is but a 
span, 
And the periwinkle man 
Will always be happy 
However he may fare. 
For happy indeed am 
As through the streets I 
cry, 
"Periwink! periwink I 
periwick I 
who'll buy! 
A

haip'nny."

But in daylight and spakin', while breakfast was makin', 
I 
fearel that I

Some officers look'd at Inc. sour as a

With suspicion, or something, akin to it, 
But I 
never opeu'd my mouth all the time, 
L: Unless ' twas to put something into it. : j 
With the best of good living and jolly good berth, 
The days flew away to my liking, 
I 
ate, drank and smok'd like a 
lord of the earth, 
Throughout every bell that was striking. 
With a 
book in my hand I 
would nod when they spoke, 
As if study with me was the main thrick, 
So at last thro' the ship it was passed as a 
joke, 
E: '• That the 31. D. was rather eccenthric.":11 
But, as bad luck would have it. a

Dart backward on our lea, 
We think of thee, dear home, 
Far on the deep blue sea. 
Swift o'er the rolling wave, 
Our bark speeds gaily on, 
Each billow seems the grave 
Of happy moments gone ; 
Hope points to brighter hours, 
We wipe our tears away, 
And think of that blest land, 
Where friendships ne'er decay. 
CHORUS. 
Still as we watch the foam, 
Dart backward on our lea, 
We think of thee, dear home, 
Far on the deep blue sea.

Engrossed in daily cares,

For the footsteps on the stairs. 
For when I 
read, or sing or play, 
Or join int pleasures sweet, 
I 
seem to Sue her glad and gay, 
And miss those little feet ; 
Oh; it is hard to think she's gone, 
With all her winuing airs, 
To think I 
never inert s't all Lear, 
Her " Foitsteps on the stairs." 
Her golden curls still cluster round, 
Her brow so white and clear, 
And on her face, now white and cold, 
I've she I 
full many a 
tear, 
The lids have drooped o'er those blue eyes, 
Death's icy seal is fir irs ; 
"ris he that has forever hushed, 
Those " FoJtsteps on the stairs." 
I 
know her feet are walking now, 
The sh -ning streets of heaven ; 
I 
know that to that dear one's brow, 
A 0

I'm thankful that she is at rest, 
Safe from earth's sinful snares, 
Yet, still 1

"And I

Joe's donkey on his hind legs reared, 
Joe clasped his neck, to fall he feared; 
So restive all the mokes appeared, 
Couldn't get them to their places. 
But Julia's donkey off did go, 
With tail erect his blood to show, 
Swift as an arrow from a 
bow, 
At Brighton donkey races.—Cuoaus. 
(1)

BRIGHTON DONKEY RACES.—NONCLUDED.] 
Joe's donkey gave his tail a 
switch 
And o'er his head Joe Brown did pitch, 
And Julia raced on as if bewitched, 
At galloping break-neck paces. 
"0 save me, .Joe !" she screaming cried, 
Joe stood transfixed to see his bride, 
Mazeppa like, careering ride, 
At Brighton donkey races. 
Cnottus.—Talk about vagary, &c. 
Julia's make rushed into the sea! 
From his back overboard went she, 
From which bath she did not agree 
When starting for the races. 
Like a 
water-nymph was Julia seen, 
As floating on the waves so green, 
Upheld was by her crinoline, 
Sad Brighton donkey races. 
CHORUS.—Talk about vagary, Aie. 
A boat soon put off from the shore. 
"A Joey to save her," Joe did roar, 
"I don't mind sixpence—twopence more, 
Bring her to my embraces." 
The boatmen pulled with might and main, 
The " mermaid " Julia's side to gain, 
"She's saved!" cries Joe, " and I'll refrain 
From Brighton donkey races." 
CHORUS.—Talk about vagary, dc. 
By the tail they the donkey caught, 
To the boat's stern they made it taut, 
And soon ashore they both were brought 
With all sorts of grimaces I 
Joe soon paid all expenses due, 
Then kissed his bride and donkey too I 
And ne'er more did such folly do 
As " Brighton donkey races."

So fare you well, white folks, I

We've got a

A bully set of engines, and a 
bully captain too; 
And yet there is one thing of which you'd never think, 
Our boat she chaws tobacco, and she's very fond of drink. 
So fare you well, cte. 
And now to prove my words, though foolish they may seem, 
If she didn't drink the ‘vater how could she make the steam? 
And when she once is started it takes a 
bully boat to whack her 
For it's chew, chew, to go ahead, and chew, chew to back her. 
So fare you well, dze..

THE BOSS OF THE RING. 
0 
rings are all the go dust now, 
And all have secret springs, 
In fact you haven't half a 
show 
Unless you know the rings; 
The lades too are up to this, 
Those angels without wings, 
And one can hardly get a 
kiss 
But they claim wedding rings. 
CHORUS. 
And so they boss the rings, my boy, 
And so they boss the rings, 
In fact, we haven't half a 
show 
When women boss the rings. 
They govern people now by rings 
We never had before, 
And ev'ry year some new one springs 
To make the people sore. 
They make up rings in Church and State, 
And so contrive to rule, 
And will unless we smash each slate 
And empty every pool. 
CHORUS. 
And so we'll boss the rings, my boys, 
And so we'll boss the rings, 
In fact we haven't half a 
show 
Unless we boss the rings.
