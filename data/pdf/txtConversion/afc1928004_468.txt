A CARD. 
These artists are engaged at an enormous salary in 
all the first-class theatres of the country, and during 
the last three seasons, appeared in all the principal 
cities of the Union, California and Australia, winning 
the most artistic triumphs ever recorded in the amuse-
ment annals. 
They are the authors of all their speci-
alties and sketches, -which has made them so popular. 
Their appearance each evening is the signal for a 
unanimous round of 
applause, peal upon 
peal of 
laughter, and shouts of admiration. 
They are, 
un-
doubtedly, the 
GREATEST CHARACTER ARTISTS IN AMERICA; 
AND JUSTLY TEEMED 
THE MAGNETS OF THE VARIETY STAGE.

TnE IIIT OF THE SEASON. 
I 
see ye all laugh at us, and wonder who we are, 
Like all the rest you think that we are French ; 
For we're styled on the bills, Mons. and Millie Chain De Marr, 
But our real names is Mike and Mary Lynch. 
My father was an Irishman, but he led a 
German band, 
Her father was a 
bum with lots of gaul ; 
At a 
very early age they whiped us on the stage, 
Now as ballet dancers we can teach them all. 
CHORUS. 
As around the stage we go, on our light fantastic toe, 
When we appear the ladies cheer, 
And say, oh, ain't they spry ; 
They call us ducks aud daisies, 
We set them all half half crazy. 
With our winning smile and elegant style, 
We're the bosses they all cry. ( sym.) 
For we're going to be at the head of the ballet, 
The king and queen of the ballet, 
Like a 
fairy, so airy, (sym.) 
Oh, don't we look grand in the ballet, 
We mash all the boys in tie gallery, 
Like a 
fairy, so airy, we throw our gains about. 
We are the greatest attraction that ever played in town, 
No matter what we ask for, it is ours ; 
We have a 
room at home where we hardly can sit down, 
For all around is nothing else but flowers. 
Oh, myself and Mary Ann, we're the original Can Can, 
Before the curtain every night we got a 
call ; 
They sell our photograph for two dollars and a 
halt, 
We somehow catch the people one and all. 
As around the stage, etc.

Our colonel's name is Johnny Drew, 
And he's the one to put us through; 
To-morrow when we're dressed to kill, 
For the Shamrock Guards are going to drill. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ! aint we happy, 
Just as happy as eau be ; 
Two Irish soldiers, here westand, 
• Captain Mike and Pat McGee. 
Every night when the drill is done, 
Arrah, that's time wa have our fun; 
Whiskey flying left and right, 
Which makes the boys all want to fight. 
Some are gathered in a 
crowd, 
Singing songs and talking loud; 
While others dance and shout hurray, 
What lots of fun on drilling day.

GOOD evening to you all, 
We hope to see you well, 
We thought we'd make a 
crab 
So hear what we've to tell. 
O'Rooney, that's our name, 
We're brothers, Mike and Dan, 
From Ireland, boys, we came, 
Two honest, laboring men. 
Now we were made two link( rs by trade, 
We'll tell you the reason why, 
When we were young, we first began 
To tinker on the sly ; 
Bat now we're on the road, 
So give us but a 
chance, 
We'll show to you a 
thing or two, 
In Irish song and dance. 
With our blang, blang, blang, 
And our clang, clang, clang, 
To your pots and kettle we'll attend. 
With our blang, blang, blang, 
And our clang, clang, clang, 
Have ye any tinware to mend. 
THE MERRY TINKERS. 
Continued. 
We'll mend your old kettles, 
Your boilers and baking pans, 
Your coffee pots, your tea pots, 
Or any kind of cans. 
We never deal in politics; 
Yet how handy we could be, 
To sodder and patch 
What fraud has cracked, 
And mend the country. 
We soon shall stop our roving, 
When it comes on winter time, 
'Tis then we work inside our shop, 
Where our trade it is so fine, 
But now we must away, 
Please remember, if you can, 
The merry old Irish tinkers, 
Brothers Mike and Dan. 
Duet Chorus. 
With our wack, wack, wack,

THE OLD OAR TREE. 
Words and Music by J
OHN T. KELLY. 
Music published by Wm. A. POND & 
Co., 25 Union Square, 
New York. 
Sung with immense success by Miss ALICE D'ERINA: 
I 
am sitting by the old oak tree, 
Where oft in days gone by, 
We at and told our tales of love, 
My Alice, (lear, and I. 
How sad to think that all must fade, 
Bnt the saddest thing to me 
Is when I 
think of other days, 
Down by that old oak tree. 
That little stream that ran close by, 
Still murmurs on the same, 
And the rustic bridge where oft we stood, 
And spoke each other's name. 
The country roadside where we walked, 
They all bring back to me, 
When all alone of love we talked 
Down by that old oak tree. 
How quiet seems the resting-place 
Where Alice she was laid, 
Where birds they sing in summer time 
And blossoms bloom and fade. 
How well I 
know we all must die, 
My only wish would be, 
'To lay me down by Alice, dear, 
Beneath that old oak tree.

OLD RAGS AND BOTTLES. 
Words and Musk by John T. KELLY: 
Sung with immense success by the great " Bards of Tara," 
KELLY & RYAN. 
We're a 
pair of ould Irish junkmen, 
We buy up what e'er we can find, 
We work hard at our occupation, 
In picking up junk of all kind. 
From the dear ould green land of shamrock 
A 
few years ago we came out, 
As partners we started this business. 
And from morning till night we do shout— 
CHORUS. 
Any old rags, 
(sym.) 
Any old bottles, 
sym.) 
Any old rags to put in our bags, 
Have ye any old rags or bottles to day ? 
When we landed with only two shillings, 
We was told by a 
loafer named Burke 
To go to a 
bladder refinery, 
And the boss he would put us to work. 
Faith we soon found out all their queer tricks, 
Their jokes, their stalls and their gags, 
So we put the two shillings together, 
And started at bottles and rags. 
Any old rags, ett 
Now before we leave we must tell you 
That we love to deal honestly, 
So if ye have old rags or bottles, 
We'll come buy them all do you see; 
For all kinds of rags whatsoever, 
We'll pay the best price that is out, 
We'll come with our cow- bells a-ringing, 
And at the top of our voice we will shout— 
Any old rags, etc.

Both. 
We've traveled many a

man, 
There's none can come up 
To Peggy and Dan. (Repeat.) 
Dan. 
At a 
race or fair, we're always the first, 
Peggy. 
And don't we dance till we almost burst?

beautiful leg:

Written expressly for the " K. H. K.'s," EMERSON, CLARK 
and the DALY BROS. 
Of all the happy darkies that ever yet was born, 
There's none that's half so joyful, for we are crazy gone ; 
There's music in the kitchen, there's music everywhere, 
Each nigger's full of kissing, for there's honey in the air. (

To- night we're nearly crazy, for to-morrow am the day, 
We're going to be married and throw ourselves away ; 
You'll see them all a- marching—we'll be at the head, 
Dar'll be a 
great commotion, when us four coons are wed-

THE COAL HEAVERS. 
15 
Written by JOHN T. 
KELLY. 
As originally sung by the Inimitable " Bards of Tara," KELLY 
& 
RYAN, at all the principal Theatres throughout the country] 
with tremendous applause. 
We've shoveled coal since early morn, 
Now for our boarding-house we're bent; 
One dollar a 
day is what they pay, 
Troth that's divilish easy spent. 
In a 
great big ship down here in the dock, 
That's filled from top to bottom with coal, 
It's there every morning we do flock, 
And shovel all day down in the hole. 
CHORUS. 
Shoveling coal now that's our business, 
Every night it's home we stroll, 
We're full of fun, and sometimes whiskey, 
Hurrah for the lads that shovel the coal. 
We wish the times would only get better, 
So all could work throughout the land ; 
How many poor men now are starving, 
While the rich in luxury lives so grand. 
If we were rulers of the United States, 
We'd take a 
very different plan, 
We'd make all old rich rascals work, 
And give their place to the laboling man. 
hoveling coal now, etc. 
Written by Tilos. 0. DAVIS. 
Sung by KELLY & RYAN, the 
famous " Bards of Tara." 
When I 
was a 
lad I 
served a 
term, 
As a 
latherer of mugs in a 
barbers' firm ; 
As a 
five-cent barber I 
soon got sore, 
So I 
got drunk one night when I 
wrote " Pinofore." 
I 
wrote " Pinafore " so tsuccessfullee 
That it's sung by all the snides in the country. 
As a 
great composer, I 
made suck a 
mark, 
They made me inspector of the tramps in the park; 
So for fear small-pox would destroy their gaul, 
I 
had them vaccinated with a 
cobbler awl. 
And by doing this job so " Komikally" 
They paid for my ferry over to Jersey. 
Between writing and shaving I 
made such a 
name, 
The Widow Oliver's lawyer I 
soon became; 
Then I 
gambled in a.clothing store with an old galoot, 
That by turning five aces I 
won the suit., 
Oh, it fit me so quick and looked so seedy, 
That I 
sold it for a 
dollar in a 
hash foundry. 
By smoking old stumps I 
paralyzed my jaw, 
Then I 
went to rag-
picking and a 
hand-
cart did draw; 
I 
drawed so well and became so smart, 
I 
soon became the owner of a 
big ash-cart. 
Now, I 
bored you all to-night so frightfullee, 
I'd better rig my " Pinafore " and skip away to sea. 
Words and music by JOIIN T. 
KELLY. 
Originally performed by the only " Bards of Tam," KELLY & 
RYAN, with immense success. 
Here we are two scrubbing women, 
At this trade we make our living, 
Working hard the livelong day, 
For our rents and debts to pay. 
Our husbands, they were both of them brothers; 
From old Ireland they ran, 
Carrying the hod was their daily labor, 
Pat and Dan Gilhoolihan. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, please to take pity, (symph.) 
While we sing our sorrowful ditty, (symph.) 
We're washing, scrubbing and singing all day, 
And minding our children our time goes away. 
Repeat last two lines. 
Now we hope ye'll all have pity 
On us poor widders from the old sod, 
We can't find a 
job in the whole city, 
And starve, by the powers now that's no cod. 
Here we've been these last five years, sirs, 
Left with children big and strong, 
I 
have three—and I 
have four, sirs, 
And there all of them happy as the day is long. 
Oh, please to, etc.

With spirits always gay.

Can never come back again.

Mary Ann Kehoe. (Repeat.) 
Ho, ho, ha, ha! Ough! 
Every night when supper is done, 
Mary Ann, my daughter, 
In the yard she meets Burke's blackguard son;

Red-headed Burke's an accordeon player, 
Mary Ann, my daughter, 
And they dance to the tune of " Slobbery Days," 
Mary Ann Kehoe. 
CHORUS. 
Such reeling and spelling, 
Mary Ann, my daughter,

With a

RNEY FROM THE LAKESIDE. 
Originally sung with success by C. P. HYLAND. 
When I 
left dear old Ireland, 
On a 
bright sunny morn, 
And parted there on dry land, 
The place where I 
was born ; 
I 
landed here in the middle of the year 
Just of the Battery ; 
And made my trip on a 
great big ship, 
And come to America. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
come from sweet Killarney by the lakeside, 
Where the pretty little ducks and drakes ride ; 
For my name is Mr. Carney 
From the Lakes of sweet Killarney. 
In the land where the floury praties grow. 
As soon as ever I 
landed, 
My friends wanted to know 
how things were in old Ireland, 
Where the floury praties grow. 
They told me I 
was welcome, 
And took me by the hand, 
Then we danced and sung till morning light, 
In praise of Paddy's land. 
For I 
come from, etc. 
So now I'll say good evening, 
I 
can no longer stay; 
I've done my best to please you, 
And it's time I 
was away. 
So now I 
must be leaving, 
And just before I 
go, 
We'll give three cheers for Erin, 
Where the floury praties grow. 
For I 
come from, etc.

THE DAY I WALKED O'LEARY; 
By J. RICHMOND. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Air:—Base Ball. 
My name it is McGinty, yes 
I 
live on ham and floor, 
With O'Leary, the walker, I 
came here, 
For to walk a 
mile a 
hour. 
About half-past twelve o'clock last night, 
A gang gave me a 
terrible fright, 
They woke me up and set me tight, 
For to walk against O'Leary. 
They took me to a 
great big field, 
And with alcohol set me crazy, 
They stripped the clothes off to the skins, 
And it makes feel so lazy ; 
it was then the gang began to talk, 
Saying who is the terrier going to walk, - 
And they said they would hang me if I'd boulk 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
The first mile I 
walked my legs were weak, 
And the gang commenced to holler, 
They sprinkled salted upon the track, 
And it made me feel so lazy; 
All the other walkers were ahead, 
Eating sponge cake, pie and bread, 
0 
heaven, I 
wish that I 
was dead, 
When I 
walked against O'Leary. 
I 
walked until I 
eatched the cramps, 
Around and around the track, 
All the ladies threw bouquets at me, 
There was a 
corn on my back. 
The judge told me it was time to stop, 
As around the track like a 
chicken I 
flop, 
For the want of a 
whiskey I 
thought l'd drop, 
The day I 
walked against O'Leary.

GEORGE MAGEE. 
By HARRY BENNETT. 
I 
AM a 
man of distinction and learning, ye see; 
I 
am a

I 
am the flower of fashion wherever I 
be; 
With the boys I've spent many a 
dime;:

can live fast or slow, 
Whichever may suit me the best, 
And whenever I 
stop at a 
ball or a

I

And my smiles they can never resist ; 
My black Carolinas the barber he curls, 
And I

And every one knows as they look at my clothes 
They've made of good stuff, firm and strong; 
As I

meet 
Pipes my figure as I 
move along. 
I

I 
LEAVE IRELAND AND MOTHER BECAUSE 
WE A.R.E POOR. 
-Written and Composed by W. T. GROGAN. 
Dedicated 
to GEO. W . 
RAYNOR, the popular tenor. 
FAREWELL, clear Erin, I 
now must leave thee, 
With good heart I'll bear it, if 'tis fate's decree ; 
With a 
burden of sorrow, an exile I 
roam, 
Through cruel misfortune I'm driven from home. 
My aged, lonely mother I 
leave in despair, 
Who is helpless and feeble from sorrow and care. 
Hardship and trouble we long did endure, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because we are poor. 
To reflect on the past it occasions regret, 
The days of ray boyhood I 
ne'er can forget, 
The home that my father left mother and I, 
We now must abandon, and are turned out to die. 
Farewell, to your valleys and moss-bordered stream, 
Your mountains so lofty, and meadows so green, 
The place of my birth, darling sweet Donaghmore, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because we are poor. 
When leaving mother she grieved we should part, 
She said separation almost broke her heart. 
My blessing be with you, prosperity attain, 
Is the wish of a 
mother you may ne'er see again; 
She filled with emotion, it pained her to speak, 
As the,large pearly tears coursed down her pale cheet 
With a 
parting farewell, at our old cottage door, 
I 
leave Ireland and Mother because we are poor.

THE JOLLY IRISH LADS. 
Words and Music original by RAYMOND & MURPHY, 
Copyrighted 1878. 
•Ne're two jolly irish lads, and from Ireland came o'er, 
In a 
big steamship across the raging sea, 
We left behind us there, a 
darling young and fair, 
And I 
know that she'll prove ever true to me. 
Sh?. is fairer than the flowers that are blooming in the 
spring, 
But SOM1 she'll take a 
trip across the sea, 
And when we're side by side, we will trip it 
off in 
style, 
When together, then, how happy we will be. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, don't I love my Mollie, 
though she's now in 
Ireland, 
Her eyes would captivate you at a 
glance, 
And when we're side by side, we will trip it off in 
style, 
And do for you our Irish song and dance. 
When we were leaving Ireland, across the sea to roam, 
From her we found it very hard to part, 
An.1 the token that she gave us when we were going 
away, 
Was a 
lock of hair which we wear next our heart. 
Allhough the sea divides us, we are dreaming night and 
day, 
Of the darling whom we left across the sea, 
But when we're side by side, we will trip it off in 
style, 
And together, then, itqw happy we 
iU be. 
Oh, don't I 
love, eto.

THE LADS FROM THE LAND OF SHAMROCK. 
Written by BARNEY FAGAN, of FAGAN & 
FENTON, and respect-
fully dedicated to Master Kane & McAloon. 
W E'RE two Irish lads, just from the land of Sham-
rock, 
That spot to every Irish heart so dear, 
When the boys and girls are ever free from sorrow, 
To a 
fair you'll find they come from far and 
near. 
You are always sure to find them light and hearty, 
For trouble sure they do not care a 
fig, 
Twould delight you to see them at a 
party, 
Dancing in an Irish reel or jig. 
Citottus. 
We are go;ug to try and show you how they do it, 
If your attention you will give us for a 
while, 
We'll show the easy style and gracefull movement, 
Of the Irish lads from dear old Paddy's Isle. 
Our thoughts are wandering back to dear Ireland, 
We 
left our colleens in that land afar, 
With them we'd pass away the happy moments, 
Driving in our little Irish jaunting car. 
But we're going back to see our darling's, 
For we promised them we wouldn't stay away. 
We've got for them our pockets full of shillings, 
We promised them to have some future day. 
We are going, etc.

shrink, 
Then our home will be happy again. 
Dennis, come home, etc. 
BARNEY ALEEN. 
Barney Aleen, I'm down by the gate, 
Don't you know I 
am waiting for you ? 
You told me you'd come around about eight, 
And I 
know you'll be faithful and true. 
I'm longing to hear your fond voice once again, 
As you whispered to me sweet and low ; 
Your footsteps I'm longing to hear in the lane ; 
For the clock has struck eight long ago. 
Cironus. 
Barney Aleen, say, what do you mean ? 
I 
know you are faithful and true, 
It's long after eight, and l'm down by the gate, 
I'm waiting, dear Barney, for you. 
You told me last night you had something to say, 
When you kissed me good-bye at the door; 
You said you were coming to meet me again, 
And see me the same as before. 
I 
know you will ask me to be your fond wife, 
And the answer, of course, you can guess ; 
For, Barney, I 
love you far better than life, 
And 
certainly say to you " yes." 
Barney Aleen, etc. 
Barney, Aleen, what do you mean ? 
Do you ever intend coming at all ? 
I 
hope you're not wandered with some other maid, 
And gone to a 
party or ball. . 
It's lonely I'm waiting still down by the gate, 
And my heart groweth sad with its fear ; 
I 
am thinking, dear Barney, why yon are so late, 
And your footsteps I'm longing to hear.

To twirl the twig, or drik strong whiskey,

If the four-leafed shamrock we could get now, 
All bare-footed cripples would be shod; 
No poor needle woman would sit down; 
But be gay, like the boys that carry the hod 
CHORUS. 
Drink success to Irish labor, 
Just new over from the sod ; 
All we want is laborers' wages, 
For We're the boys that carry the hod. 
We'd have no shifting politicians, 
But every man would honest be; 
Old starvation, he'd have no relation, 
And ould Ireland would be free; 
We'd have Saturday night three times a

Fine roast beef, and less salt cod ; 
Then everyone would happy be, 
Just like the boys that carry the hod.

As performed only by KELLY S
I' RYAN, the original " Bards of 
Tara," with Tony Pastor's Double Company. 
Good-evening, kind friends, we hope you're enjoying 
Very good spirits, now everyone, 
But we poor souls, our hearts arc near broken, 
For the loss of our husbands that's now dead and gone. 
'We're nurses you must know in a 
family up town, 
We take care the childer from morning ' till night ; 
Our wages are small, but we save them all, 
And in singing and dancing, we take great delight, 
CiroRus. 
We can sing, we can dance, 
We're as lively as ever, 
And we're not so bad looking, 
You must allow; 
Sure, we're just forty-five, 
Both strong, stout and hearty, 
We wonder will anyone 
Marry us now. 
We're trying to find two god honest men, 
Who'd love and protect us all through our life; 
Ah, we've seen the time, yes, again, 
When we could have been a 
rich man's wife. 
But let us once more only get such a 
chance, 
We'll not be a 
fool, but we'll hould to him fast, 
For every day, you get older they say, 
And to be young and good-looking, faith it won't always 
last. 
We can sing, etc.

THAT NIGHT WHEN I GOT 110AIE. 
Words by Trios. 0. DAVIS. 
Music by JOHN T. 
KELLY. 
Sung by KELLY, & RYAN, in Oiler laughable sketch entiled 
" 
Family Troubles." 
My nar.,- is Dan O'Rielly, 
I 
livc: in New Jersey ; 
Wheu my work keeps me out nights, 
Illy wife goes on a 
spree. 
She gathers all the neighbors, 
For she never drinks alone; 
Now I'll tell you how I 
found them, 
That night when I 
got home. 
When I 
got home they were dancing, 
Sure, I 
thought the house would fall; 
Old Casey with his fiddle, 
Was propped against the wall. 
Pat Hennessey was singing 
The" Sweet Maid from Athlone ;" 
Well, they were raising the very divil, 
That night when I 
got home. 
McGinnis the old bummer, 
Had on my new frock coat; 
And my fine silk dollar neck-tie, 
Wrapped around his dirty throat. 
THAT NIGHT WHEN I 
GOT HOME. 
Conttnued. 
My wife she was a 
yelling, 
In the corner all alone; 
"Isms worse than any mad-house, 
That night when I 
got home. 
My new black shining beaver, 
Made a 
spittoon on the floor ; 
They've being no napkins in the house, 
Sure my clean white shirts they tore. 
Then the " Bards of Tara" was singing, 
Did Mr. and Mrs. Malone ;" 
ALd the" Hod-
Carriers" was singing the eiorus, 
That night when I 
got home. 
With a 
boot-
jack in my right hand, 
I 
rushed around the room ; 
Between kicking and thumping 
I 
cleaned it very soon. 
But the battle quickly ended, 
Then like a 
king upon his throne, 
I 
gazed upon my mined castle, 
That night when I 
got home.

CLARENCE M eGRAW. 
Words and Music by Joini T. 
KELLY. 
Written expressly for and sung by TONY PASTOR, at his New 
Opera House, New York. 
My name it is McGraw, oh, I've a 
wife that's fly, 
If I 
ever take a 
glass of wine she can see it in my eye ; 
One pleasant day last ,sumn:er, a 
particular friend of mine, 
Axed me to go to Coney Isle and have a 
jolly time. 
Says he, we'll have a 
lark and stay out after dark, 
My wife just coming in had heard the last remark, 
Where are you going, dear, dressed i
n your best, to-day ? 
'm going to attend a 
funeral— then slyly she did say— 
CHoitus. 
Clarence McGraw, Clarence McGraw, 
You're giving me taffy, you rascal, you know you are ; 
Clarence McGraw, Clarence McGraw, 
You're at it again with your tra-
lala-
la-
la-
la. 
Repeat Chorus. 
Says I you're wrong, my dear, to judge me in that way, 
Says she, Pm only joking, love, so do.n't mind what I 
say ; 
So off we started for the boat, bent on a 
good day's fun, 
And when on board I 
laughed at how my wife had been 
outdone. 
We drank a 
basket of wine, then feeling very fine, 
Fell in with two ladies and had a 
terrible time ; 
While strolling on the beach, as sure as I 
am wed, 
My wife she met me face to face, and this is what she said 
Clarence McGraw, etc. 
For a 
long time after this, at home I 
had no peace 
No matter what I'd try to do, the discord would not cease ; 
I 
bought her a 
dress at Stewart's and a 
handsome diamond 
ring, 
Well, anyhow to stop the row, they proved the very thing. 
'Tis the wife that always rules, I 
tell you they're no fiiols, 
Don't never try to curb them, for you'll find they're just 
like mules, 
Although we're both mad, she sometimes for a 
lark, 
When of some serious thing I 
speak, she's surely to remark:

CHILBLAINS OF YOUR OWN. 
Parody on " Children of Your Own:" 
Written by JonN T. 
KELLY. and sung by BILLY BARRY, at 
TOny Pastor's Opera House, New York. 
While meandering through Union Square, 
My attention was attracted there 
To a 
Jimmy Lush who up to me did come; 
Oh, my pants they don't fit tight, 
For my stomache is too light, 
Was the words of this dilapidated bum. 
I'm a 
brother to Jacob Astor, 
Now will you give me a 
Porus Plaster, 
I'm cold, and my undershirt is torn ; 
Don't think I'm a 
tramp or beat, 
Because I 
have sore feet. 
For remember you have chilblains of your own. 
CHORUS. 
So when a 
tramp you meet 
Put socks upon his feet, 
Give him money, friends, all, do not let him moan ; 
For he may be rich who knows 
With bunions on his toes. 
Remember you have chilblains of your own. 
Now, there's the working girls so true, 
Who lives on Fifth Avenue, 
And the rich ladies down on Thompson Street 
Do they ever stop to think, 
That bum would ever drink, 
No, no, he'd rather walk in his bare feet. 
For a 
tramp is hard to shake, 
And a 
boozer takes the cake, 
Sometimes you have to smash up their jawbone. 
To have a 
doctor's bill to pay, 
Would make any e
tld judge say: 
Let him die, for I 
have chilblains of my own. 
So when a 
tramp you meet, etc.

A 
Sentimental Irish Character Duett: 
Words aud Music by JOHN T. KELLY. 
Sung with great applause at Tony Pastor's Opera House, New 
York, by the People's Favorite Character Delineators, 
KELLY & RYAN, the " Bards of Tara." 
This world seems so dreary, our lifes seems so weary, 
Both aged and feeble in the poor-house we tend, 
Our evening is closing, we'll soon be reposing, 
In that peaceful home where our sorrows will end. 
How sad is our fate, how hard to relate, 
The troubles we have had my old wife and I. 
CHORUS. 
For we've journeyed together, 
But death soon will sever ; 
Iu old age we wander, 
To the poor-house to die. 
How well we remember that cold bleak December, 
When the last of our family, our Dennis he died, 
It left our hearts aching, both sad and forsaken, 
Oh, would to God we had been laid by his side. 
Our relations are dead, in the years that have fled, 
We hope soon to meet them in that home on high. 
CHORUS. 
For we journey together, 
But death soon will sever; 
In old age we wander, 
To the poor-house to die.

Theatre Comigne, New York. 
AIR.—" Up at Dudley's Grove." 
I'm Jimmy Fresh from Hoboken, 
A 
negro man so nate; 
I'm a 
dummy in a 
clothing store, 
I'm a 
giddy colored boy. 
I 
drive a 
hearse for a 
soup house, 
And l'm waiting for a 
date ; 
But last night I 
got the laugh, 
From a 
Chinese dame from Troy, 
Ctiones. 
Oh, she took me for a 
bummer, 
I 
was slugged by a 
lot of gills ; 
They smashed me in the nose 
With a 
suit of underclothes, 
Up at Harry Hills. 
They threw me in the sewer, 
They wiped the floor with me ; 
They made me walk a 
thousand miles, 
And they stabbed me in the neck. 
They made me swallow a 
boxing glove, 
Then I 
cryed in the keg of G, 
When they rolled me in a 
pot of beans, 
And made me drink a 
peck. 
CHoitus. 
Yes, they kicked me in the left lung, 
Which gave me the fever and chills; 
They hit me in a 
jaw, 
Up at Harry Hills.

LEAVE NOT YOUR HOME. 
Words by THOS. 0. DAVIS. 
Music by JOHN T. 
KELLY. 
Sung with great success by ALICE LEWLEA, in the drama of 
"Irish Emigrant." 
Leave not your home, for you know not the sorrow, 
The grief of the fond hearts you leave at the door; 
The void in the cabin there'll be on the morrow, 
The home that once knew thee will know thee no 
more. 
Ali, ne'er will the scenes that your childhood has cher-
ished, 
In the first beams of morning make glad your fond 
eye, 
On your memory perchance they may start up before 
you, 
When wandering alone in some strange land to die. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, leave not your home, for you know not the sorrow, 
Or grief of the fond hearts you leave at the door. 
The void in the cabin there'll be on the morrow. 
The home that once knew thee will know thee no 
more. 
Oh, leave not your home, for you know not the trials; 
That arise at each step as you move from the door; 
Grim life's dreary road it now lays out before you, 
You reach not the goal, for you're heartsick and sore. 
Oh, stay where the comforts of home they enshroud 
you, 
Where each eye is beaming with love, hope and joy; 
Ah, hard is the heart that knows not the feeling, 
0 grief at the words as they murmur good-bye. 
Oh, leave not your home, etc.

AIR.—Day When You'll Forget Me. 
He called me an awful tart name, 
And slugged me when I 
was not looking, 
Because I 
kissed fat Rosanna Jane, 
When she some hash was cooking, 
When she some mystery was dissecting. 
He hit me with a 
Saratoga trunk, 
With an axe my corns he commenced pareing, 
While all this time a 
Scotch bull .terrier pup, 
The bosom of my pants fell to tearing, 
Yes, the bastings and the linings he was disabling. 
Citon.us.

Then he grabbed me by my chest protector, 
And fired me in an old spittoon, 
Robbed me of my green socks and my red suspenders, 
And made me eat a 
left-handed broom, 
If ever I 
catch that chicken- breasted rooster, 
1'11 carve him like a 
Cincinnati ham, 
Yes, I'll hit him and I'll slit him, till his pants don't fit 
him, 
You bet he'll find I'm had, bad man. 
Oh, give me back my red neck-tie, 
My yaller dorg and my kitten, 
And my photograph, you Blissville calf, 
With all the billet douxs I've written, 
For I 
here give you the mittert. 
Yes, give me back my wet day pants, 
Get my lunch route from your brother, 
I've gained 360 pounds since I 
got sober, 
And I've learned to love another, 
And I 
tell you she's a 
daisy.

THE JOLLY OLD CODGERS. 
Words and Music by JOHN T. 
KELLY. 
As sung by the Inimi-
table KELLY & RYAN, America's Greatest Irish Character 
Artists and Comedians. 
Them wicked young boys they laugh at us; 
Whenever we chance to go by, ha ! ha! 
They call us old suides old blokes and old bums, 
And say we a 
regular guy, ha! ha! 
We never take notice of what they say, 
If we did they would only shout more, 
For the louder they chaff the louder we laugh, 
For boys will be boys the world o'er. 
CHORUS. 
You'll always find us jolly, 
We're never melancholy, 
For that would be a 
folly, 
We drive dull care away, ha, ha. 
(Repeat.) 
We always wear a 
pleasant face, 
For our hearts they are light and gay, ha ! ! 
We always look on the brightest side, 
And drive care and trouble away, ha! ha I 
Oh, be old when young and you'll be young when old,

motto you all should cage; 
If you only live in the way we have, 
You surely will enjoy your old age.

Parody on " Johnny Morgan 
Written expressly for BILLY BARRY, by JOHN T. Kia.T.v. 
Johnny Morgan." 
I'LL sing about a 
hungry gang, 
That lived on Crosby Street 
That frightened the whole community, 
The way they used to eat. 
There name it was Maloney, 
The father was a 
Sixth Ward tad ; 
Well, they tackled a 
saloon on Bleecher Street; 
And this is what they bad : 
Johnny Maloney, chewed boloney, 
And his brother chewed pig's feet, 
his sister chewed corned beef and cabbage, 
And the old man eat hash meat, meat—meat—meat, 
All alone on a 
big ham belie, 
They pulverized so neat, 
Then the young fellows gave them a 
five dollar note, 
To go work another street. 
(Repeat.) 
They called and called and called for more, 
Most anything they'd chew : 
The beans they made a 
terrible bit, 
They took four encores on a 
stew. 
They eat until they all fell dead, 
Then the coronor's jury sat, 
And the verdict of the Maloneys' death, 
Was that they died from total starvation.

Than this old Irish couple. 
Last week we met a 
dear old friend, 
And the first words he did say, 
I'd hardly know you both at all, 
You're younger every day.

Is follow out our plan; 
Be happy and gay, let come what may.

AIR.— Home Sweet Home. 
Oh, the subject I 
have taken for to wrestle with to-night, 
Will make you sick I 
know before I'm done ; 
So sit up straight and keep your seats, and cry with all your 
might, 
While I 
sing about the tramp, the lush, and ,bum. 
For the Crosby street Italians are burning up their harps, 
And the pawn shops are going to decay ; 
The Hebrews are starving now down in Baxter street, 
And Grandfathers Clock is getting gra2 .. 
CHORUS. 
Then help all the bummers, 
Give them forty or fifty dollars, 
Put them in a 
brown stone front on Fifth Avenue; 
With cuffs and paper collars. 
Oh, never hit them in the ear, 
For that would hurt their health, 
Although Mrs. A. T. Stewart she is poor, 
You may be rich yourself. 
Count Johannes he got love-sick, and married Baby Mine, 
Dr. Landis cut his throat with a 
clam ; 
Johnny Morgan stole an organ, and he's now serving time, 
,Such an education has my black-and-tan. 
Oh, the tramps they are eating all the benches in the park. 
And giving all their money to the poor. 
Don't never try to borrow a 
lady's front teeth, 
And never throw your money in a 
sewer. 
CHORUS. 
So help all them dizzy blondes, 
There's a 
stuffed club in the stew, 
If you want to get a 
lady stuck on your shape, 
Go paint yourself with glue. 
For in the sour bye- and-bye, 
We'll put schoonars on the shelf, 
Never eat a 
poor man's plaster, 
For you may be rich yourself. ,

" 
Honor and Obey." 
'Tits many long years since I 
left my old home; 
In Ireland the place I 
was born; 
In a 
rustic old cot, a 
once happy spot, 
As ever the sun shone upon. 
My mother God bless her, she kissed me good-bye, 
Then begged me to keep with fond care, 
More dearer than gold, this relic so old, 
This lock of her silver grey hair. 
CHORUS. 
With tears in her eyes she kissed me good-bye; 
Then begged me to keep with fond care; 
More dearer than gold, this relic so old, 
This lock of her silver grey hair. 
This dear little treasure I 
cherish so dear, 
Because when upon it I 
gaze, 
It brings back my mother's face, gentle and kind, 
And the scenes of my boyhood's fond days. 
Yes, take all I 
own, drive me out of home, 
Do what you may I 
would not care, 
But pray don't take my little keepsake, 
This lock of my mother's grey hair. 
With tears in her eye, eta. 
THE OLD TIME BUMMER 
Parody on " The Old Wooden Rocker." 
Written byjnomks 0. D AVIS, and sung by EDWIN FRENCH, 
Banjo Soloist, with PASTOR'S Star Troupe. 
There he sits in the Park on the bench grim and tall, 
The old time bummer that naught can appall; 
His mind it now wanders to a 
drinking saloon, 
Oh, how quickly could this fellow put a 
hambone in 
ruin. 
Oh, how well he remembers in days long gone by, 
When we stood round the soup-house my old pards and 
How we used to get fat on the fine, refreshing smell 
That arose from the hash-shop we all loved so well. 
CHORUS. 
Twenty years has he slept on the dock, dock, dock, 
And the sight of a 
bed, it would give him a 
shock, 
See the coat that he wears it has no tails at all, 
It's a 
dizzy old Ulster and three feet to small. 
The Beer-Kegs have gone and the new ones have come 
Oh, what joy it would give him could he sleep with 
one; 
But he hopes soon to "meat " In the Sweet Pie and 
Pie," 
When he thinks of a 
lunch he heaves a 
long sigh. 
Once more he toddles off to work his lunch route; 
He prays that the bartender will not fire him out ; 
He's lost all he had, but he still retains his gala, 
This old time bummer, so lean, lank, and tall. 
Twenty years has he slept, etc.

For here the blackguards drive me mad,
