TX01: Carl Fleischhauer and I went out this afternoon about 4 
p.m. 
to see Delores and Harvey Webb, who live next door to Henry 
and (Edna?) Webb on Route 563, about half a mile past G-Hedger 
House; 27GT on the way south into Chatsworth. We saw an enormous 
snapping turtle (animal) crossing the road as we drove down: about a 
seven inch diameter on the shell, 
looking fat and healthy. We 
were tempted to pick it up and bring it home, but we had nothing 
to put it 
in, 
so we drove on down. Delores (DeeDee) met us when 
we knocked at the door, and after a brief visit with Mrs. Webb 
Senior over at the house next door, we began a guided, taped tour 
of the grounds shared by the two families. 
Harvey is the ninth of ten children, and has followed in his 
dad's footsteps to some extent, continuing the work of salvage 
and some gathering in the woods. The yards have several sheds and 
small buildings, a couple of trucks used for woods work and 
hauling, a large vegetable and flower garden, and toys and swings 
for the children 
who are often there. The whole aspect, under 
the 
late afternoon sun, with the flowers blooming and several 
children about, 
laundry on the line, people in and out of the 
homes, was crowded, cheerful: projects everywhere, 
in various 
stages of completion. The Webbs have been here about fifteen 
years, but from the look of the place one could easily think 
there had been at least forty years of creativity put into the 
landscape. {yardscapes) 
The houses themselves are peaked-roof structures, with 
aluminum or vinyl siding over tar paper; dormer windows, and 
linhays of brick built by Henry and Harvey. They are 
in 
the 
process of covering the front of Harvey and Delores's home with 
rockwork: Harvey brings big, sandcoloured or beige boulders home 
from his work operating heavy equipment, when they are dug up on 
a construction or demolition site, and they are building up an 
exterior wall 
of rock and cement which, DeeDee says, will provide 
a lot more insulation. It 
is 
an impressive thing, eight to 
fifteen inches thick, smooth and nicely patterned. The largest 
rocks are perhaps seven or eight square inches in height, width, 
and depth, and are placed near the foundations of the wall;

or handed up over one man's head to the other 
ladder. DeeDee explained that they finished the 
with a piece of wood to give a straight surface 
meet, sealing out the cold. 
{architecture} 
Carl wandered by himself for the first twenty minutes or so 
of my tour with DeeDee, getting frontal and side views of the 
houses and gardens and sheds. Meanwhile, DeeDee showed me the 
playhouse built by Harvey's brother-in-law who lived 
in this 
house before they did, 
longed for by their children but 
temporarily filled with garden tools and stored odds and ends: 
dog and rabbit food, dry 
in big twenty-five-pound bags; rolled 
wire; tires. It 
is about five square feet, made like a little log 
cabin, of pine boards, roughcut with some of the bark still 
on 
them. 
It has a peaked roof like the two "real" houses, and a 
full-sized wooden door, now with its central pane missing and the 
shed easy to reach into without opening the door itself. She 
pointed out Henry's raspberry patch beside it along the road 
frontage, 
laid out, 
like the main gardens further back, 
in neat 
rows. 
Behind the playhouse-cum-shed is the rabbit hutch, where 
four fullgrown rabbits, three plump and browny-black, one 
brown and rangy, crowded up to the door when Dolores came 
wiggling whiskery noses, watching hopefully to see 
if she 
going to open the door. She explained that they love to get out, 
and the sandy one was the result of crossbreeding with a wild 
rabbit on one of their garden excursions. She feeds them dry food 
pregnant mothers 
craps and makes sure to remove 
est the males kill 
the newborns. Other than that, 
blems with disease except a worm they pick up 
if 
on the ground: she keeps hers a good three feet 
oth worms and wild dogs. She explained that the 
nto the rabbit's body from its skin surface and 
rs 
its heart, killing it. She recognizes the 
worm's presence by the rabbits' 
listlessness and 
weight. She phones a dealer when she has baby 
as pets; people also stop by from time to time 
eep rabbits, and buy one for meat. 
(animal)

was 
Wild dogs appear around their place from time to time for 
the same reason that her fluffy black and white kitten came to be 
there: people abandon unwanted pets on the roadside. She has seen 
them do 
it, she explained, and often takes cats 
in to protect 
them from being killed on the highway, which is apparently a 
frequent occurrence. Wild dogs have sometimes tried to get her 
rabbits, but she 
is gentle even with them, only tossing something 
at them to scare them away. Harvey added later that he has less 
time for animals than Dolores, but understands her feelings about 
them. Their young children also enjoy the rabbits and the kitten 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 2 
and seem to treat them well. 
She next showed me Harvey's boat, a fiberglass sixteen—foot 
motorboat, white with green trim. He takes 
it down the Mullica 
River and catches perch, for the most part G—New Gretna; 15GT --
they consider catfish too hard to clean, and do not eat them 
themselves, but give them to Henry and Edna, who are fond of 
catfish. Dolores pointed out that you have to skin catfish, 
whereas perch must only be scaled. 
{fishing} 
We strolled back from the road toward the back section of 
the property, and Dolores pointed out a woodshed that used to be 
used as a greenhouse all 
year round, for vegetables and flowers, 
until they needed a place to keep firewood dry and had no time to 
build another shed for it. 
It 
is a big one, perhaps eighteen by 
seven feet, with sheets of soft plastic covering its window 
frames, and a peaked roof like the other structures on the place. 
We caught up with Carl 
as DeeDee showed me the outdoor work 
area used by Harvey and Henry when they trim cattails for sale to 
florists' wholesale dealers. There was an iron cement mixer, 
broken in two pieces, lying there, and a thick mat of cattail 
leaves lying grey and dry underfoot. Carl took photos of us 
talking with the tape recorder set up, and of the mixer, which 
Harvey got from a friend and intends to fix and use. We then 
moved north toward the chicken coop and the main vegetable 
garden, where six—year—old Jeremy, their nephew, climbed agilely 
up 
into the grapevines hanging rich with concords, almost ripe, 
on the wire and wood frame of the 
long coop. About sixty 
chickens, Bantam and black and Rock Island and crossbreeds, 
milled about catching the grape skins Jeremy tossed in to them 
after he had sucked the sweet inside of the grape out. He handed 
me a grape and explained his technique with precision and 
kindness, hospitably offering to get me a can of grapes to take 
home, but I declined, for Dolores was admonishing him to get 
down, because the grapes were not yet purple and fully ripe. She 
told me that a lot of neighbours come by to ask for grapes to 
make jelly with; few remain for the family's own use, and 
apparently no charge 
is made as far as she knows. What does 
remain is made into jelly by Edna and, sometimes, herself, 
in 
Henry and Edna's spacious kitchen. 
(plant) (foodways) 
A bee gum, as Carl called it -- a section of tree trunk 
containing a natural honeycomb -- was set up under a tree not far 
from the chickens. Harvey had brought the section home after the 
tree was felled on a construction site where he was working, he 
and Henry putting up with stings and buzzing as they cut and 
moved the hive. Jeremy talked knowledgeably about the role of the 
queen bee as he 
led me through the empty area between the 
chickens and the tomato rows, 
left barren because, he said, "the 
Man above" made this bit of soil 
too acid. He showed me where his 
granddad (whom he obviously admired very much) takes a chicken, 
slips one of 
its feet through a small 
loop of rope suspended from 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 3 
a treebranch, and leaves 
it until 
it 
is tired and quiet enough 
that he can take his sharp knife from where he has lodged its 
point in the wooden wall 
of the coop, and cut off 
its head. 
Jeremy demonstrated the holding of the chicken's neck and the 
death stroke with great aplomb, with none of the gory theatricals 
of city children I have talked to about death: he simply showed 
me how it was done, as he would explain how to hold a shovel or 
plant a tomato seedling. 
Harvey came home from work about five, and joined us without 
even going 
in to the house for a drink or a shower, courteous and 
generous in showing us around. He explained the method of 
preparation for each of the kinds of metal he collects: he tests 
for magnetizability if 
he 
is 
in doubt as to content, and 
separates light and heavy metal, grades of metal, and types such 
as 
iron or steel versus aluminum, copper, and alloys. He saves 
useful parts for future projects, and breaks down complex 
structures like car motors into their simplest components, 
because this raises the price paid by the junk dealers. Friends 
often call, he explained, and tell him where to find appliances, 
cars etc. on the back roads 
in the woods: he ranges a wide area 
and knows 
it very thoroughly, so that verbal directions are easy 
for him to follow.

A SENSE OF PLACE IN THE PINELANDS 
We stood in the dust of the auction barn floor, the men 
drinking Budweiser and shooting the breeze after the crowd had 
left, ten or ten—thirty at night and everyone about ready to call 
it a day. The moon was full 
in a clear sky, the air chill with 
the touch of fall, smelling of dust and trampled grass where the 
crowd had been a few minutes before. The chat was quiet, dry— 
humoured, passed around a group of eight or so, conversations 
crossing one another, rising and falling, blending and separating 
easily. Some were from New Gretna or other nearby towns; others 
from farms and homes there in Tabernacle. 
The woods fill 
in between the farms and fields, bigger and older 
than this old community, surrounding it with their quiet 
presence. Grapevines overgrow its roadsigns and telephone poles; 
scrub pine and oak overshadow its homes and roads. People know 
they are surrounded: a burnt—out farmhouse on Indian Mills Road 
is already lapped by tall grasses and long vines, and will soon 
be swallowed up as whole towns have been 
in the fast—growing 
forest of the region. The woods have a resilience and permanence 
unlike that of climax plant ecologies, for it burns and 
is cut 
again and again, growing back thicker than before, nourished by 
its high, deep table of pure water, renewed by its fire—triggered 
reproductive cycle. Human life and 
its creations are less 
resilient, more susceptible to 
irreversible change, and more 
capable of causing it as well: the old cemetery building will not 
return to 
its original purpose and construction, and only the 
green and white historic marker reminds the 1980's that it was 
once the Tabernacle in the Wilderness, where John Brainerd 
gathered white and Indian worshippers to Quaker services in 
1788. 
The new housing development of Muskegum Woods will not give place 
again to the trees and homes bulldozed away to clear a space for 
its foundations. But forest fire and chainsaws and the crescent 
sickles of the cattail gatherers do not bruise the land forever. 
Talk about the region turns upon vulnerability and 
resilience. Standing on the empty, moonlit highway at midnight 
with Harvey and Delores Webb of Chatsworth, I followed Delores's 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 5 
pointing hand to where grapevines had been gathered in armfuls a 
few days before, to be made into frames for floral wreaths. 
"They'll come back twice as thick," Harvey explained. 
Where I'm working, we're bulldozing an area where there's a lot 
of white birch, just little whips like florists use. I'm going to 
ask my boss if my brother—in—law can cut it before we destroy it, 
so he can get the good out of 
it. 
But if we weren't going to 
destroy 
it, 
it would come back twice as thick after he cut it. 
There 
is no local sense of need to push all 
those trees and 
vines out of the way. They cherish the power of their resources 
to replenish themselves: the grapevines and birch bring income; 
the woods bring firewood, mushrooms for frying, snapping turtles 
for soup, and space to breathe. It 
is people, not trees, that 
make longtime residents feel surrounded. 
"We noticed the other day that we can hear people 
if we 
listen out the back door," said a young mother in a small home on 
a thickly wooded road. "Having neighbors close enough to hear --
that's so new to us." 
A New Gretna man, standing with the others 
after the auction, felt the pressure as acutely as she. "We never 
had to lock our doors; now I feel I have to; we never thought 
about boundary lines -- 'Oh, 
it's over there somewhere,' we'd say 
-- until all 
of a sudden somebody's building right up next to 
you." 
A farm woman stood by her living room window, looking across 
the quiet highway to the pines and fields on 
its other side. "The 
worst thing about it," she explained thoughtfully, "is that 
people move out here to get away from town, but then they want 
everything that they had 
in town out here. They want paved roads; 
they want garbage collection. Those are the two main things they 
change, but there are lots of others -- and pretty soon it's just 
like town. They haven't gotten away at all, and they spoil 
it for 
those of us that know how to 
let 
it stay the way they first 
wanted it to be: how to keep the things they came here for." 
It 
is more than the love of country people for the country; 
more than the fear of change or the initial response to new, 
encroaching forms of culture. Space to breathe, woods rich 
in 
resources for those who know how to use and protect them, are 
only the articulable tip of the iceberg. The ease of relationship 
between people and place 
is deeply felt, routinely enacted, but 
it slips from the grasp of words like water through the hands. 
"Piney" 
is 
an epithet worn with easy pride by some, defensive 
pride by others, but it 
is a verbal sign for a deep and complex 
ethos: a love of space and quiet; a feel for the woods; a 
knowledge of the land's resilience and fragility. 
The men lingering at the end of the auction were friendly 
and open, gracious about the prospect of having government 
microphones and tape recorders set up 
in their midst next 
Saturday night, when a bigger auction is held. A woman and a 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 6 
stranger, they included me in their talk of business and 
auctioneering, suggesting good places to set up the microphones 
and joking about being photographed. My non—Jersey voice and 
Virginia license plates have not damped the welcome shown me here 
or anywhere else in the Pines: no one stood on ceremony, or 
geared their talk to the controlled range of tones and topics 
people often use for being polite to strangers. 
In spite of the 
commuting urbanites who have flooded the Pines in recent years, 
the 
love of place does not seem dominated by the desire to keep 
strangers out. People simply want it to stay the way 
it 
is, 
and 
are aware that both nature and culture are threatened. The fifty 
or a hundred people who came to the auction and 
sat on the dusty 
bleachers, bidding for toasters and dishes and small shrubs ready 
for planting do not live, for the most part, 
in Muskegum Woods, 
but on farms and in houses along Tabernacle's quiet roads of sand 
and blacktop. Their gentle murmurs of "excuse me" as they wound 
their way between the other spectators on the way to cars or 
bathrooms were not the manners of people whose space to breathe 
is gained by shoving, figurative or literal. The quiet chat at 
the counter in the kitchen, where two local women fixed hot dogs 
and sauerkraut, cheese steak hoagies and coffee, was not the chat 
of small groups adrift in a sea of strangers. The attitudes 
toward persons and toward the land that come out of communities 
like Tabernacle are themselves a cultural resource, endangered by 
crowding and not easily renewed. Both are valued, their 
resilience to comprehensible and appropriate demands respected, 
and their fragility before unmanageable ones understood. 
The Pines are scrub land, sandy, monotonous, thick 
in summer 
with mosquitoes and greenbacked flies. Their towns are like those 
in many parts of North America, a patchwork of field and farm and 
back road and fruitstand, white clapboards and steepled churches, 
red barns and tanned, dusty, 
longlegged kids. Their rarity, 
natural and cultural, lies more in what they do to people than 
in 
what you see at first glance: 
in qualities, not things. One New 
Gretna family moved here because three of their children were 
deemed gifted after their early intelligence tests at school: 
their parents wanted them to grow up "normal," not placed in a 
special category by themselves, in a school where the principal 
taught three grades and the classes were small, the community 
stable, and the woods big enough to nestle one's life within. 
Another woman chose to raise her kids 
in her parents' Pinelands 
home so that they could roam without running into fences every 
twenty yards, and learn something from the land as well 
as the 
schoolteacher. Such decisions reflect some of the hidden depths 
of Pinelands feeling: an 
intuitive sense of the health and 
strength of outlook that can be drawn up from a childhood in a 
small and friendly community, 
in a wide tract of forest. 
A grey—eyed young man, blond and wide—shouldered and twenty 
or so, straddles the top board of a fence that partitions the 
dirt floor of the auction's arena, a Budweiser can resting on 
it 
in easy reach, men forty years his seniors standing comfortably 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 7 
around, the group unified in common interests and feelings. He 
is 
telling me about a child's wagon, made of oak by some local 
carpenter of a few generations back, that sold at the auction 
some time ago for eight dollars and now sits 
in the window of a 
local florist's shop. He has offered two or three times that 
price for it, 
"but they just laugh. It's beautiful: I'd use 
it as 
a coffee table," he explains, "because it's locally made." 
Another young man, a few years younger, wears a sweatshirt 
bearing a picture of pines and streams and moonlight on 
its back. 
"I'm proud to wear it," he tells me, standing up straight so that 
I can focus my camera on his back, "because I'm a fullblood 
Piney: I've lived 
in New Gretna all my life." The older men 
sipping beer and joking as the evening ends are 
in plain overalls 
and flannel shirts, and there are no "Piney Power" bumper 
stickers on their cars and trucks, but their feelings are as 
deep, carved upon the shape of 
life 
in the region as they and 
their families have created and kept it. They say little, but the 
standing trees, the vines allowed to twist round poles and signs, 
the deer that leap away when surprised by headlights on a road at 
night reveal values made verbal by younger residents. They have 
not cut and cleared the Pines into submission, but harvested the 
woods without scarring them beyond their capacity to heal. 
The ecology is 
in process, stopped by the ethnographer's 
camera in a moment of 
its shifting patterns of development and 
change. Culture also 
is 
in process, and what is traditional today 
was newfangled in 
1900. Today's everyday life 
is tomorrow's 
folklore, 
if 
it 
lasts; tomorrow's history, 
if 
it does not. There 
is 
no point in talking as 
if 
life 
in the Pines had progressed 
undisturbed for endless peaceful years before housing developers 
and urban refugees broke upon 
it 
like a wave. Yet there 
is truth 
in the assertion of sudden change, new and irrevocable 
if allowed 
to continue, 
in the comments of Pinelands people about their 
region: the continuity of the past may be in the eyes of the 
beholder, but the fragility of the present is real. Awareness of 
place 
is sharpened by the threat of the immediate future. 
In an old Greta Garbo movie 
is a scene 
in which two lovers 
awake 
in the morning, soon to part ways after a night in a 
roadside inn. The man returns from dressing to find Garbo moving 
about the room, feeling a fold of the drapes with her fingers, 
smoothing the wood of the walls, sniffing the air. "What are you 
doing?" he asks. "I want to remember," she explains simply. The 
look 
in the eyes of the farm woman, gazing out her window at the 
fields not yet covered by houses, reminded me of Garbo's look. 
Too many people in the Pines respond quickly, almost painfully, 
to comments on the future of their homes. You can't take a forest 
for granted any more. The love of times is doomed to pathos, for 
with all 
our science we have no way of keeping now from becoming 
then at its inexorable pace, but the love of place has more 
serenity for 
many people. The Rockies are not crumbling fast 
enough to see; suburbs sprawl, but the space around one's house 
does not shrink to claustrophobic dimensions in a season, as 
it 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 8 
has for plenty of people 
in the Pines. Some speak of 
it 
like 
people who want to remember, because the time of parting seems 
already upon them, though some hope remains that it will not come 
to that.

TX01: Yesterday, Saturday morning, I set out for Tabernacle by a 
deliberately circuitous route, 
learning the country and taking 
photographs on my way southwest from the project headquarters 
near New Lisbon. I drove first through Browns Mills noting a 
simply preposterous number of yard sales G—Browns Mills; 19GT in 
progress: there were people milling about on the green near the 
shopping center, fingering racks of clothes and examining boxes 
of dishes; people parked by three or four homes along Lakehurst 
Road, 
looking at vacuum cleaners and holding shirts up to their 
shoulders to try the fit. As I drove south out of town on the 
Browns Mills—Pemberton Road, there was yet another sale 
in 
progress in front of a neat golden—painted house: clothes were 
tossed across the wooden fence that separated yard from road, and 
several carloads of people had stopped to examine them. A heavy, 
elderly man sat in a green lawn chair under a tree by two tables 
and several boxes, piled with shoes and children's games, dishes 
and glasses, jar lids for canning, and pitchers and vases of 
thick, white, painted china. I pulled over, shouldered my 
cameras, and walked over to ask if I could take some pictures. 
Adolph Mackner was a little hard of hearing, but his eyes 
were bright with interest and hospitality as he chatted with the 
passers—by who had stopped at his sale. I commented on the nice 
appearance of the things displayed and of his property. "My wife 
did all this," he said, 
looking around at the smooth, wide green 
lawn and well—spaced trees that surrounded the house, and at the 
swingset and garden chairs set therein. "She sure did a good 
job," I responded. "Yep, she worked hard," he agreed. I gave him 
one of the American Folklife Center brochures I had stuck in my 
bag, and explained a little about the project, asking 
if he'd 
mind 
if I took a few pictures of the sale. No, he said, I could 
take all 
the pictures I wanted, so I began fiddling with lenses 
and twisting dials, kneeling and clicking and moving about, to 
the interest of the other people buying things. 
They were 
tolerant and kind, and pretended to 
ignore me when I pointed my 
lens 
in their direction. After a while, Mr. Mackner motioned me 
over to his chair. "Go back there and praise my wife on the 
property," he said quietly. "You'll do me a favour. And take some 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 10 
pictures of the grandson, too." I said alright, and walked back 
through their garden to where a young mother and father played 
with their toddler, Tony, on the swingset, and a sunny—looking 
woman with short—cropped grey hair sat on one of the swings. 
Steffie Mackner is one of the warmest and most open people I 
have met in this warm and open culture, direct of gaze, ready to 
think the best of you, with smile lines at the corners of her 
eyes. She started to tell me about the house, and how she and her 
husband had come to make it what it 
is. They had bought it 
several years ago because, as senior citizens on a fixed income, 
they had been afraid to stay where they were any longer: interest 
rates and prices were too much for them, and rising all 
the time. 
They got it at a low price because it was a wreck: the basement 
full 
of water, the walls black with mildew, 
leaks 
in the roof, a 
huge pile of smelly trash 
in the back garden. The two of them did 
the work themselves, installing a pump to keep the water down in 
the basement; stopping the holes where 
chipmunks tunnelled under 
the rugs; fixing the roof; and most of all, buying things at yard 
sales. Adolph had taken the swingset from someone's trash --"he 
asked permission, of course" -- and mended and painted it and 
bolted a plastic dairy box onto the teeter—totter, so that little 
Tony could have a secure seat. They had found a lovely hex sign 
G—Browns Mills; 19GT and two horseshoes at a yard sale, and put 
them up on the garden shed, over its door. There were various 
creative projects in process at a workbench next to it. The house 
had been, Stephie said, "a challenge." I should think it was. To 
look at 
its smooth siding and new paint, 
its newly—built linhay 
and enclosed front porch, one would think it was about ten years 
old: the chances are that it 
is nearer fifty, or more, though 
they do not have a date for it. She showed me the first apple on 
a little tree her mother had planted from a seed, and the garden 
chairs which were, she explained, also from a yard sale. "We've 
furnished the whole house from yard sales," she said, and her son 
agreed with a laugh. 
The yard sales provide income as well 
as goods for Adolph 
and Stephie. She explained that it 
is difficult for them to get 
through the end of the month before their checks come, and the 
bit of income from having yard sales helps them manage. "We 
could't manage at all without the yard sales." Nevertheless, they 
do not cling to their profits. The things for sale today were 
"the last sale of the year," she explained, and whatever was left 
over they would give to the church for those poorer than 
themselves. I bought a shirt and a dress at ten cents each: clean 
and fresh, without a broken thread or a spot on them. 
Because of my professional interest in 
local history and 
culture, Stephie said, "You should have been here last year: we 
had a real 
live hermit living here 
in these woods." He was 82 or 
83, with a long beard and hair and a hat, and "rotten old clothes 
just falling off his back -- I felt so sorry for him." He had 
lived near her, 
in an old broken—down house in the forest, and 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 11 
had endeared himself to his neighbors by picking up trash from 
the roadside and putting it 
in a central place deeper in the 
woods. He was a gentle man, and Stephie had often gone over to 
talk to him or bring him a hot meal. He used to come within sight 
when he felt like a visit, so that she would know he was there 
and be able to come out 
if she felt like talking with him. He 
made a trail 
of cans leading to his house, and told her to follow 
them any time she wanted to come and see him. His sister used to 
bring him dried foods and dry goods every couple of weeks, and he 
lived on that, not cooking. She finally took him "home" a few 
months ago. Stephie misses him. 
I plan to go back to see her again when we enter Phase II 
of 
the fieldwork, and interview her about her yardscape and 
renovation and her crocheting, which won her a ribbon at a local 
craft fair not long ago. She invited me to stop 
in for a cup of 
coffee and a chat any time I'm 
in the area. 
TX02: 
Later that day, as I drove south out of Tabernacle, I 
spotted a hitchhiker in a blue running jacket, blond and slender. 
I thought I recognized him as a local 
kid I had met at the 
Tabernacle auction a few nights before, so I pulled over. 
It was 
not the boy I'd met, but a man a bit older, with deep hollows 
under his eyes and a great sadness in his face. A minute after he 
had climbed into the car, he had told me his name -- Gene -- and 
shaken my hand with a good firm grip, and begun to tell me of his 
divorce ten months before. He was grieving deeply, though he said 
he was starting to recover, and we talked for several miles about 
the pain of readjustment and the shock of such losses. I drove 
him to his destination, his aunt's home 
in G-Hammonton; 11GT, and 
he 
invited me 
in to meet his relatives. 
We walked into a small, crowded kitchen in a house newer on 
the outside than it 
is on the inside: the way of 
life 
lived 
in 
it 
is clearly a tradition older than the bungalow it 
is being lived 
in. There was a china cabinet, filled with plates and cups and 
special pieces of glassware, with five or six religious prints 
tucked into its doors; over the doorway that led to the living 
room, a plaque of the Last Supper was hung with a rosary of brown 
seeds and gold chainwork, with an 
intricate woven shape of 
bledded palm fronds attached to it. Mrs. Edith Graziano, the 
owner of the house, sat at her kitchen table; around her were 
Gene's mother, and a half-sister and her husband who were 
visiting from New York State. They all welcomed me easily, though 
I was very conscious of the anomalous nature of my presence: how 
many women pick up male hitchhikers, and accept an 
invitation in 
for a cup of coffee? I couldn't very well say that I had done so 
because of the pain he was in. So I admired the plaque, and Mrs. 
Graziano showed me another in the living room over the mantel --
both done by a daughter of hers, from kits. She explained who the 
people were in the graduation and portrait photographs arranged 
on the mantelpiece, and we returned to the kitchen. 
Interiors. 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 12 
After some interesting general chat about Italian recipes 
exchanged between Mrs. Graziano and her New York half sister, 
they told me a bit about Our Lady of Mount Carmel Day: an annual 
event for the Hammonton Roman Catholic church(es?), on which the 
saints' statues are lined up on a roadside and people pin paper 
money to the statues' clothing as offerings -- hundred dollar 
bills included, according to Gene. I asked permission to 
photograph the palm weaving, and Mrs. Graziano let me 
lift it 
down and have Gene hold 
it out in the sunshine for me. Once in 
the back garden, I saw a shrine about three feet tall, with a 
statue of Our Lady and a red lampstand with a picture of Christ 
in 
it, so I asked Gene to stand by 
it and took the photos there. 
Back 
in the house, she told me that her late husband Rocky used 
to make the palm weavings (she didn't seem to know a name for 
them) every Palm Sunday morning right after he returned from 
early Mass: breakfast,m then weaving, every year. 
Religion, 
(celebration) 
The holy pictures interested me because their placement is 
the same, over the doorway and 
in the kitchen cabinet, as 
in 
Irish Catholic homes 
in Ireland (in pictures in Kevin Danaher's 
The Year in Ireland) and 
in eastern Newfoundland.They were also 
interesting because she had two particular ones that I have 
associated with charismatic culture because of their recent 
dates, and the direct closeup of the face of Christ. She gave me 
the same reason for liking them (unasked) as charismatics have: 
"the eyes follow you: no matter where you are 
in the room, He's 
looking at you." There are no holy pictures in the living room; 
many, 
including a prayer on a china plate about having a Martha 
life and a Mary mind, 
in the kitchen. She was very kind and 
invited me to stop back any time, and wants photo copies. 
TX03: 
The Tabernacle auction was considerably bigger, 
in 
terms of crowd and number of 
items to sell, than the Thursday 
night one had been -- as Ronny Harker had told us 
it was. I met 
Mary and Jens there, and we recorded and snapped photos for about 
three hours while Ronny and various assistants sold young pigs, 
chickens, quail 
in small boxes, pullets and chicks, bushes for 
yards, young pine and cedar trees, hay, a car, a horse trailer, a 
donkey, a pony, and all 
sorts of tack -- horse harness and saddle 
pads, rabbit cages, feed, farm implements like a post hole digger 
(that was a favorite). The crowd was quiet and genial and had a 
good time, and seemed to be 
local, peppered (a bit too much) with 
interested urbanites. 
I talked to Ronny's wife Charlene between photo sessions as 
she worked at a desk 
in the auction office, small and dusty and 
crowded with voices and smoke and people coming in and out, while 
another woman sat at the window and wrote down names of buyers 
and collected their deposits. She explained to me that the 
auction had started about 20 years ago, when Ronny's father Earl 
started going to local sales with his sons, picked up the 
auctioneer's calls by listening, and decided to start his own.

TXO1: Today I drove through 
part of our geographic regions 1 and 
2 with Brad Thompson, the second son of a local blueberry growing 
family, who is now studying historic preservation at Penn and 
working for the National Park Service and the Pinelands 
Commission. He took me on a guided tour south on the fire lane 
going parallel to Route 70 south of Four Mile Circle for about 
ten miles; through Vincentown and 
its surrounding farmlands; and 
south to Chatsworth and down to Batsto; and north back to 
Vincentown through Hammonton and Tabernacle. 
Brad took me to 
meet his maternal grandmother and grandfather, and to see his 
grandfather Westcoot's cedar—shaked two—story barn; through some 
of the Thompsons' blueberry fields, where I photographed farm 
equipment and layout of bushes; to a couple of traditional 
packing sheds in other berry fields; to Buzby's store in 
Chatsworth to visit with his great—aunt Alva Buzby; to see Cathy 
Pepper, the postmistress of Chatsworth; to a log cabin in which 
several of his older relatives had lived; and to Tru—Blu 
Cooperative's packing house, where I visited with two of 
its 
coordinators. 
Tru—Blu was started by Elizabeth White, the woman who (as 
Brad explained to me while driving) spearheaded the hybridization 
of the blueberry in the 1920's. Their headquarters is a couple of 
miles south of the Pinelands Commission headquarters; their 
manager, Dennis Doyle, 
is young and relatively new to the job, 
but comes from an established blueberry family, which seems to be 
an 
implortant indication of solidness and seriousness to some of 
the other growers. Brad explained that Miss White had worked with 
botanist Stanley Coville to get people to bring them wild bushes 
which were especially tall and upright, rather than ground—cover, 
and had large berries, to develop a strain or series of strains 
for cultivation. (The following day I saw Miss White's detailed 
log book of this research, describing each bush and the location 
in which it was found; who brought it 
in; and its response to 
frost ahnd various growing conditions, which is kept by Mr. 
Philip Marucci, entomologist for the Blueberry and Cranberry 
Research Center off Route 563 south of Chatsworth. The Center 
also has photographs of her, and old bound copies of the 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 15 
Proceedings of the American Cranberry Growers Association dating 
back to the 1980's; copies of Cranberries magazine, with ads 
placed by her for Pine Barrens berries; old, framed labels of the 
first berry packers; and extensive files on insects and diseases 
affecting berries.) Denny and his associate, Joe, gave me the 
names of several growers whom they felt had a good grasp of 
regional history and current concerns, and shared their own 
opinions on some of the 
issues facing growers at present. 
Denny commented that the conservationist interests expressed 
in state legislation (a common rankling point with several people 
I talked to associated with growing in one way or another) seem 
to be geared solely to the water (that is, the aquifer) and not 
to the people, Joe and Brad concurred that some folks have felt 
as 
if they were being ignored in political discussions of the 
region's importances and valuable resources. They also said that 
there was a lot more expression of animosity about 18 months ago 
between the growers and interests of the Pinelands Commission 
than there 
is now: things are quieter, but not necessarily any 
more resolved. The sorest point with them, and with Betsy 
Carpenter of the Research Center when she discussed grower—state 
relations with me the following day, seems to be that a number of 
people have represented the growers as uninterested in or 
uninformed about conservation. This upsets people for two 
reasons: one, they pride themselves (as a number of nonpolitical 
conversations demonstrated) on their skill at protecting the 
purity of the watersheds that feed their bogs and fields; two, 
they have been feeling left out or or misrespresented in many of 
the committees and legislative meetings related to environmental 
questions about which some growers have "done their homework", 
they argue, better than the environmentalists have. Betsy 
Carpenter explained the details of this situation to me on Sept. 
28, and I detail 
it 
in the notes from that conversation. 
Denny mentioned that the state's Green Acres program, a 
program designed to keep agricultural 
land under cultivation in 
spite of developmental pressures, had benefited mostly corn and 
soybean farmers, and especially those whose lands border the New 
Jersey Turnpike and other high—visibility areas. He was not 
particularly bitter about this; simply pointed out that it didn't 
do much for berry growers or for people whose lands were less 
visible. The theme of politicans' concern with publicity and 
looks and visibility and showmanship recurred during several 
chats I had about environmental and agricultural 
issues. Denny 
and the others were more upset by the failure of the legislators 
to get enough background information on farming before passing 
certain other regulatory laws: for example, the buyback plan, 
whereby one is allowed to 
lease agricultural 
land for 15 years., 
It takes 8-10 years, they explained, before a blueberry farmer 
can expect to get a return on his capital ("let alone his labor") 
and so a lot of farmers have not participated in the leasing 
program: "most farmers are conservative and won't take that 
risk," Brad explained. Another sore point was that people who

page 16

fields fertile, 
lost "credits" with the

but I don't know what. Denny also stress

They also had some rather wry comments to make about the 
retirement communities, though the fact that their residents are 
retired working class people rather than wealthy ones has been 
mentioned in a positive light by people in Tabernacle and 
Vincentown as well as at Tru—Blu: Denny and Joe commented that 
people move to them out of fear of crime and a desire to get 
from the city, but that once there they often complain about 
of the nature and rural culture around them. Complaints they 
heard reported from Leisuretown included: the farmer's tractor 
makes too much noise; the rabbits are eating my flowers, can't 
the township do something; there's too much pollen around 
in the 
air, ditto; and , the most irritating thing to the growers, the 
residents fertilize their lawns to get Kentucky blue—grass to 
grow, which leaches into the aquifer and endangers the berry 
fields' delicate ecological balance. It 
is 
issues like this that 
make the berrygrowers strongly environmentally minded, but, as 
Betsy put it 
later, there have been personal problems between 
individual environmental people and groups and the growers which 
have made it hard for the growers to deal objectively with any 
environmental 
issue. "There's been enough excitement about tree 
frogs," as one grower commented. "The environmentalist bent is 
strong with growers, but it's gone too far."

Growers also use the concept of a good woodsman -- a phrase 
one hears from gatherers and foxhunters as well. A good woodsman, 
Denny and Brad said, 
is one who knows how to care for the 
woodland or "headland" on which his pure water supply depe 
who understands its ecological balance and works in harmon 
it. This is one of the features of growers' ethos and life 
which Denny and Brad felt had been most grossly ignored by 
environmentalists, who have often seemed to them to consid 
growers non—environmentally concerned. Another problem between 
and local growers has been growers' reluctance

is forever -- at least, that is Denny's 
understanding of 
it. People have felt that this 
is unfair to 
their children, self—determination and the right to make 
considered decisions based on one's own assessment of situations 
being an extremely strong regional value. Needs and conditions 
change, and with them definitions and perceptions of appropriate 
land use, as Denny pointed out: 
in the 1960's, berry growers did 
not get upset when developers bought out small farmers; they are 
realizing that those low—production fields had contributions to 
make to the region's overall 
life that seem more valuable now 
that they are gone. The farmers who owned them were civically 
active. 
Culturally, the farmer was productive in the 
community," as Denny put it, 
"and it's a loss you never recover." 
"It's our responsibility to protect the aquifer," Joe added. 
"There's no water protection group as such, but people do feel 
strongly about it. Once an aquifer's polluted, it takes hundreds 
of years to clean itself because the water flows so slowly." A 
current frustration related to water, because this has been an 
exceptionally dry summer and caused a very bad and difficult 
cranberry harvest because the fields cannot be flooded to float 
the berries out, 
is that sod farming G—Pemberton; 21, and 
Southampton; 23GT 
has begun recently 
in the region, and that 
means a steady, rather considerable drain on the water supply. 
They suggested I talk to Phil Marucci about this and related 
issues, at the research center; they seem to have warm relations 
with Marucci personally and with the center. 
Brad and I then drove to his grandmother Westcott's home for 
lunch, where she showed me the family Bible, 
listing marriages 
and births back to the late eighteenth century. Brad showed me 
the barn, where his grandfather keeps 20 foxhounds, and pointed 
out its mortise and pin construction and long, broad cedar 
planking. We then drove along the fire lane that runs west along 
route 70 from Four Mile Circle to see some blueberry fields and 
buildings associated with them. 
On the way, Brad explained some aspects of social class 
perceptions in the G—Vincentown; 23GT, G—Pemberton; 23GT, G—Medford; 
18GT area. 
In 
interesting contrast to McPhee's description of 
Fred Brown admiring housebuilders who "got well 
in away from 
everybody," Brad described the typical building pattern as a 
community—oriented one. Fire protection, he said, was one 
consideration that caused people to build close together rather 
than live on their berry field or bog holdings. The Thompson's 
fields, for instance, are 
in two or three communities, while 
their house (his part of the clan's) is 
in Vincentown. It has 
been typical for a long time, he said, to maintain this field 
pattern. 
Brad also explained that the DeMarco and Haines cranberry 
families had been involved on the Water Commission and other 
aspects of regional planning in the early 60's, and had taken 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 18 
steps to clear right of ways through and to their lands so that 
they could be turned to other resources (e.g., development?) 
later, knowing the longrange plans that were being made at that 
time. The Thompsons, who have been farm and sawmill people for 
generations, were worried when 
it 
looked as 
if farming was not 
going to be able to support people 
in the family any more, 
partially due to changes or potential changes 
in the land use 
patterns around them and partly due to extraregional economic 
dips 
in produce prices and labour costs. Doing manual 
labour is 
not a sign of being lower class in the Pinelands growers' 
families: 
Being a non—producer is the worst thing that you can be 
in my 
family. And yet on the other hand, we have no disdain for manual 
labour: 
it's how you were at one time able to secure a living for 
yourself, be your own boss. Everyone at that co—op 
has one vote, 
whether they have four acres or forty, . . . if they want to 
exercise it. 
It's a beautiful way to live. 
Brad mentioned that medical benefits and insurance are unmet 
needs for many local farmers, unless, 
like his father, they work 
part time with a union that provides such benefits. He feels that 
if farming is going to continue in the region and become 
economically secure, these things should be dealt with at a 
legislative 
level: Good loans for equipment, good insurance for 
families, money for kids to go to school 
if they need it, 
and the 
benefits of keeping New Jersey green, keeping foodstuff on the 
tables, seems to me to be a priority that the country should fund 
as they would fund anything else. Instead they're making it very 
difficult now, and people aren't willing to fight quite as much 
as they were." 
Berry growers tend to have social networks which stretch 
between townships, often through kinship, since it tends to be a 
family industry. Quaker families have tended to keep the fertile 
soils which they claimed as the first inhabitants of the region 
under English rule, while Methodist and other families took the 
cranberry bogs and woodlands. Italian families, who came as farm 
labour around the turn of the century, sometimes saved money and 
bought farmlands, and are now higher up the social scale; the 
labouring class is now Puerto Rican, Black, and Cambodian, 
including labourers who are flown 
in seasonally from Puerto Rico, 
and flown home again, because it 
is cheaper than paying for local 
labor. There tends to be detailed knowledge in growers' families 
about who has money, how much, and how it was acquired --
especially through knowledge of produce prices and acreage under 
cultivation, but also through rumour and social connections. 
There is also strong awareness among some families that 
Pineland families are lumped together as poor and uneducated by 
outside urban people. Brad often hears local people report that 
they have been insulted in such contexts; he himself often gets 
called a hick or a farm boy or a Piney in a derogatory way. A

When we reached Buddtown G—Southampton; 23GT, Brad 
me a particular type of traditional housing that had been of 
great interest to the vernacular architecture survey 
in which he 
participated recently: "workers' houses" where people might have 
had an acre of cranberries or blueberries, a kitchen garden, and 
probably lived on a cyclical economic basis -- that is, getting a 
living related to the seasons, rather than working in a mill 
or 
other local 
industry of that kind. He related the pattern of 
land 
use and housing here to the European pattern where people had 
small holdings and worked part time for larger landowners or 
businesses. At Buddtown there is a transition in soil type from 
fertile to 
infertile, and wheat was grown there for a long time. 
We passed a number of Quaker double pile houses 
in this region as 
well.

Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 20 
Driving through Vincentown, Brad pointed out a field which 
had almost been bought in the 1960's for a racetrack similar to 
the Indianapolis 500 speedway, which was prevented by some 
college—trained members of the local women's club and other civic 
groups. This prevention has come to be seen by some people as the 
intelligentsia's legacy to the community. 
As we came west into Vincentown, Brad pointed out the Jade 
Run Creek dam that fed the grist and sawmill there 
in 
the 
eighteenth century G—Vincentown; 23GT, when the community was a 
service center for the wealthy Quaker farms nearby. Soybeans, 
wheat, and dairy farms G—Vincentown; 23GT were the majority then 
and now. The number of dairy farms declined sharply when milk 
prices dropped in the 1960's, and people could make better money 
by selling their farms, putting the proceeds in the bank, and 
living on the interest. That way their children had money to go 
to college, which was not possible in fulltime farming. 
Brad's aunt is the tax collector for Vincentown, and she is 
the one that gets the Leisuretown calls complaining about pollen 
and rabbits and noisy tractors. 
Vincentown's main street has a lot of Italianate and Federal 
architecture G—Vincentown; 23GT; some of 
its original Quaker 
farmhouses are large, two—story structures with a couple of wing 
extensions, and occasionally a pair of Doric volumns at the 
front door. The homes seemed to me to be predominantly white 
painted, without a contrasting trim, but many in this community 
have intricate, almost lacework decorative supports on the 
central pillars of their front porch roofs. There are a couple of 
Greek Revival churches as well. We turned right onto a side road 
that bridged the millrace, surrounded by 
low trees and rolling 
hillocks. Its town plan, Brad said, was a modified English type, 
with service alleys behind the homes. 
We went to see a small blueberry field planted around 1929, 
shortly after the hybridization of the blueberry and the 
formation of the co—op, which Brad explained would have served as 
one facet of a family's livelihood, probably combined with 
mossing G—Vincentown; 23GT, pineballing G-23GT, a kitchen garden, 
woodcutting G— 23GT, and other cyclical occupations and sources of 
income. I took some photographs of two small pine clapboard sheds 
once used for drying berries G—Bozarthtown; 23GT if they had dew on 
them, and for packing, along the fire lane parallel to Route 70 a 
few miles west of Four Mile Circle. Brad explained that these 
sheds probably belonged to a family with a small house across the 
road or next door to 
it. 
We chatted briefly with an elderly 
neighbour woman who said they belonged to a family named Curtiss 
until 
recently, when a Japanese farming family had bought one of 
the fields and 
its shed. Blueberries disintegrate in sunshine in 
a matter of hours after picking; that is why the sheds are 
necessary to have right there on the field. Modern sheds used by 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 21 
his family and others are cinderblock, or cedar, or of other 
lasting materials. Brad's own favorite family shed 
is a two—story 
cedar one with storage space on the second floor, because its 
ventilation is good and 
it stays cool during the hot weeks of 
berry picking season. These sheds had "awnings" G—Bozarthtown; 23GT 
of plain pine boards 
in their windows to keep out the sun. 
These 
awnings could be raised to the exterior angle of a cloth awning, 
but were set like windowshades, vertically, 
in the windowframes, 
attached on the inside . The sheds were probably sixteen foot 
squares, but I must go back and measure them; they had English 
rear lean—to extensions as well. 
Before the co—op, 
individual berry farmers had to make 
their own contacts for sales 
in Philadelphia or elsewhere; now, 
small farming families like the Wellses have joined with big 
farmers like the Whites and (Brad thinks) the Haineses to sell 
their berries together. People also have shipped berries to New 
York for many years, via the train that stopped in G—Chatsworth; 
27GT. Wild berries, as well as cultivated, are still shipped by 
quite a number of 
local 
residents. 
I asked Brad as we drove about what goes into keeping the 
land 
in good shape, as far as blueberry growers are concerned. He 
explained: 
Well, that meant giving up every weekend, every spare minute 
that you could muster, to go out and prune and keep the hedgerows 
back. And a lot of these farmers, 
like my father, ended up 
having two jobs: one being part time with benefits, and the other 
keeping the farm as the price started to go out. So my father 
joined a carpentry union. . . . and 
in the evenings and on the 
weekends he would be a blueberry farmer -- or 
in the cold weather 
when there wasn't construction. Other people then would be on the 
fire watch, did road work 
in the winter for the state; there were 
all 
sorts of part time things that you could 
line up for. So 
what you end up doing then it, 
to keep the land 
in good shape, 
maintaining good canals, smoothing your road so you can get 
trucks around it ('cause the sand is very fragile 
and can fill 
in the canals) . . . . --systematic management of your field to 
make sure that the trees aren't seeding themselves in your 
blueberries, which will happen. . . . My grandmother's field now 
is virtually a woods: it's been out of cultivation maybe fifteen 
years G—Burr's Mills; 23GT. 
TX03: 
We discussed some of the yard art G—Burr's Mills; 23GT 
along the fire lane, 
in front of recently built bungalows and 
split—levels, as we drove. One house had plastic deer; another 
had a tractor parked in a decorative location 
in a corner of 
its 
front lawn. Brad identified these as "newcomers'" or "outsiders'" 
art and tastes -- things local people would never dream of doing. 
"And when I say local, generally that means three generations is 
what I consider local. . . . indigenous people. I realize how 
that view of other 
people coming in 
is rude or whatever you want 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
Page 22 
to call 
it, but there is a different -- a clash in values. And 
after going to high school with those kids . . . and being called 
all 
sorts of things -- from Piney to hick or whatever, 
" 
G—Vincentown; 23GT was inundated by new residents from the city 
during the 19670's, and living 
in ranch style homes with two—car 
garages became "really living" as far as 
local young people were 
concerned. Brad remembers feeling that it was somewhat lower 
status, out of the stream of things, to 
live 
in one of the older 
houses. It was a real adjustment for him to realize in his late 
teens that there was worth and dignity in 
living 
in an older 
home, 
in an old, established family: to have self worth because 
he 
is a Thompson. 
We passed a small white clapboard church, St James 
Mission in the Pines, G—Bozarthtown; 23GT, which is Episcopal. 
People who considered themselves poorer, who lived 
in older 
homes, often came here because they didn't feel comfortable among 
the wealthier people who attended the Episcopal church in 
Vincentown. This was so at the turn of the century. Brad's 
maternal grandmother Westcott has two pews from St. James's on 
her front porch: they look like pine to me, simple narrow benches 
with high backs, painted now with white enamel. 
(Washington Bozarth, Brad's great—great grandfather, was one 
of the original French Huguenots of that name who settled it, 
related to his father's side of the family. His paternal 
grandmother's name was also Bozarth. His mother's side of the 
family were "fertile—soil people" who moved around on the other 
band of fertile land on the other side of the Delaware river; his 
father's people, Beebes, Thompsons, and Bozarths, are "Pine 
Barrens people." This sort of 
information, he tells me, 
is often 
known by 
local people about their own and other families 
geneologies and social networks; G—Vincentown; 23GT. 
TX04: 
We drove to one of the Thompson blueberry fields, where 
Brad taught me how to drive on "sugar sand" G—Retreat; 23GT. 
The problem is you never stop on sugar sand: never 
put your brake on. What you would do 
is put the car in 
neutral and let 
it come to a stop if you had to do 
it; 
that 
way your wheels aren't digging down into the ground. Once 
you get 
in that sand it's all 
over, and you've got to jack 
the thing up and put planks out there and it's a mess. 
Going through "downtown Retreat", which consisted of a few homes 
and a pair of bridges across a creek named Twin Bridges G—Retreat; 
23GT and a small, trim, orange—painted wood house called "Gatson's 
Place." Brad explained the story behind this house 
in the context 
of wider regional values and sense of 
identity as 
nonacquisistive „ non—middle class people who often have more 
money than they appear to have, and/or who live simply by choice 
rather than necessity:

sawmill nearby, an 
creek. There had b 
dishes done by the 
years ago, kids of 
in the house, sery 
however, had been 
walnut stairs, and 
uncle Harvey and h 
cedar shingles. There is no sign now of the shacks; the last one 
was torn down just a few years ago, and some of the house's 
original windows have been covered over. Dutch eaves have been 
added as well. It 
is just before the fork at Big Hill Road, and 
is 
locally known as Florrie Thompson's old house, on the way to 
G—Wellsville; 23GT. 
That was Gatson's place. 
There was a black who lived 
there on a subsistence kind of a lifestyle; he died a few years 
ago. Again, what's very interesting about that . . . [is] some 
people choose a lifestyle, and money's not the goal of 
it. His 
son 
is a professional 
in California who many times tried to 
encourage him to come out and live 
in his house, with all 
those 
amenities that a modern house gives you, and Gatson enjoyed his 
walking back and forth to Vincentown and living 
in his cabin, and 
he 
loved catfish. 
We passed a house Brad knew well, and, though it had changed 
hands 
in recent years, he was able to point out and describe the 
outbuildings and activities that had been associated with them 
when blueberries were commercially grown by that family ten or so 
years before. A copse of woods had been blueberry fields; there 
had been a goldfish pond 
(yard decoration) G—Wellsville; 23GT 
close to the road 
in the front garden, and shacks where Puerto 
lived had lain behind it. There had been a 
d, 
during Prohibition, a still down by the 
een big garden parties held there, with the 
Hispanic and black workers; fifteen or twenty 
one ethnic group or the other had also worked 
ing the family. Everyone in the family, 
working farmers. In the house interior were 
inlaid oak floors that had a pattern Brad's 
is grandfather had made. It had locally made

We 
G—Vincentown 
every year f

chatted a bit about local calendar customs 
; 23GT as we drove. Brad's family has a cedar tree 
or Christmas. cut a day or two before Christmas 
re working in the cedar swamp, and that would be the 
ee. Unless we had a flocked Christmas tree, and then 
long—needled pine, and we'd whip Ivory Snow and put 
ee. 
Halloween in the area G—Vincentown; 23GT involved children pairing 
up or going in small groups based on friendship and/or kinship, 
and going from house to house, where they would be 
invited in, 
and remain silent, nodding or shaking their heads in response to 
"yes" or "no" questions designed to reveal their identities. 
Around here you'd go 
into everyone's house, and get trick or 
treats. And as a kid I guess I've been 
in every house 
in 
Vincentown. . . . You came in, 
and there were even some instances 
where you had to -- oh, for instance if Grammy Brown wasn't 
feeling well, and 
in 
the back parlor and couldn't be bothered by 
the breeze at, 
at the door, you had to go back in and say trick 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 24 
or treat and see 
if 
she can guess you. Because you knew everyone. 
. . . Now I've noticed also, with my grandmother, with the 
changing times and the razor in the apple business, 
if you don't 
know the people, the treat seems to be given outside the door. 
If 
you do know the people, "Come on 
in, 
let's take a picture," and 
-- yeah, you came 
in 
the house. . . . And the question was, 
"Do 
we know you?" And 
if you shook your head "yes," you came in and 
they guessed . . . of course you were silent; you couldn't --
they'd know your voice right away. And 
it was hard enough: they 
knew your height and mannerisms. And you had 
-- some people were 
special 
instances. Grammy Brown, for instance: that's the one my 
uncle worked for. After you got done [trick or treating] you had 
to get in the car and go out and see Grammy Brown. That was 
important, to go out there, because she wanted to see the kids, 
and not too many people would go outside of town to that place. 
And we went out to Florence [Thompson]'s also. She kind of knew 
who we were. 
. . . [They would first ask, ] "Do I know you?" And if there 
were four or five people guessing . . . generally there would be 
at least two or three people in the house, and usually older, 
older teenagers who weren't trick or treating but were staying 
home for this time, and then the mom and dad. They would ask --
well, everyone might ask, "Do we know you?" to find out who knows 
them and who doesn't know them. And then maybe, "Do you live 
around here?", they would ask, or try to narrow it down. And then 
they would look at eyes every once 
in a while, through the mask. 
And they'd say, 
"I 
know who you are!" And usually 
if you got one 
you could get the whole bunch, because usually people tended to 
go around with cousins. Or people from a church: that was a big 
deal. Sometimes the youth groups would go around together, and 
people of the same age 
in a church. Or sometimes you'd go around 
with just your good friend for this year. . . . 
We were coming into G—Wellsville; 23GT at this point: a tiny 
farming community, where we tried to see Pauce and Grace Wells, 
acquaintances of Brad's family who live on Retreat Road in 
Vincentown and farm blueberries. Pauce (Edward)'s father is one 
of the original members of Tru—Blu. Brad explained that you can 
tell who are the old families in the area by 
looking at the 
numbers assigned to their names in Tru—Btu's files, which were 
assigned in sequence as people joined. The Wellses were out, but 
Brad pointed out drainage ditches G—Wellsville; 23GT on their land 
which he explained were a precaution against flooding, to keep 
the water from standing around the berry bushes and rotting the 
roots. I saw ditches around homes, too, and asked if people dug 
them around their houses (thinking of Adolph and Stephie 
Mackner's in Browns Mills, with their sump pump 
in the basement). 
Brad said either they did that, or built their houses on the 
fields where the ditches already had to be. 
It seemed to be a 
chicken or egg situation. He suggested we ask people about "the 
different thinking" of drainage ditches: 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 25 
At one time, as we'll see over here on the right at Frelinger's, 
blueberries were planted down 
in a bog, thinking they needed the 
natural boggy area: they grew almost side by side to cranberries. 
Well, 
later I think 
it was found that higher land was very good 
for blueberries: their roots go down to the water, and then you 
don't have as many diseases. 
We were coming up to Leisuretown on the right -- locally 
called "Seizuretown" or "Senile City," but without deep 
resentment, because the working class status of most of 
its 
residents mitigates the aggravation caused by the look and 
attitudes and demands of the community 
in the eyes of the 
growers and cable TV linemen who have mentioned it to me --
tplacenames; insider/ outsider] G—Leisuretowne; 23GT and Brad 
commented that the Leisuretowne had leveled the only sledding 
hill G—Leisuretowne; 23GT 
in the area, which was missed by 
local 
people. He pointed out a blueberry field in a bog, where a lot of 
snapping turtles G—Wellsville; 23GT "go back and forth for breeding 
purposes." These bog blueberry fields are generally older than 
fields on higher ground, planted after the benefits of higher 
ground were discovered. Blueberries were traditionally fertilized 
G—Southampton Twp.; 23GT , Brad thinks, with chicken manure. 
Foodways G—Southampton Twp.; 23GT traditionally included more 
pork than beef. We have heard some references to hog killing 
being more common than cow killing. "The fertile soil people, I 
think, from what I can understand, were generally raised on beef, 
and Pine Barrens people fattened pigs, probably because the kind 
of grass that you can grow in the Pinelands is not that fertile 
or thick to support a cow." 
We were now on Sooy Place Road /Big Hill Road, which Brad 
thinks was a stagecoach road, going by the tavern at Sooy Place 
in the late nineteenth century. 
Brad had been discussing 
differences between the businesses of cranberry and blueberry 
cultivation earlier, and we returned to the topic briefly. 
Historically cranberrying was begun by New England Quakers who 
had done it 
in Connecticut and other states along the coast where 
bogs are still found today. Here Haines, for example, 
is a Quaker 
name, and they started about 1850 or 1860. 
It has been a more 
capital—intentive type of farming than blueberrying, not because 
of the need for headlands, for woods were cheap then, but because 
of the number of people needed to dig out the bogs, the cost of 
surveying and dam—building, needed to create a connected network 
of bogs whose water flowed from one to the next. The Whites, 
another leading cranberry family, seem to have perfected the 
technique of flooding the bogs, which makes harvesting the 
berries easier because the berries float; benefits the plants by 
soaking their roots; and helps when done during a frost, to 
protect them against freezing. 
The whole occupation takes a lot 
more space and labor than blueberries; 
it was much easier (and 
still 
is) to be a small blueberry farmer with a few rows or acres 
that you work yourself, and sell through the co—op. 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 26 
Blueberry and cranberry people have their homes and sheds 
in 
what Brad called 
the fringe towns -- Vincentown, Pemberton, and 
Medford G— 23GT, and their fields in "the woods." This traditional 
pattern involved bringing the berries in 
to the town where there 
was a large labor supply. The name "Piney" 
is 
locally associated 
with those who instead live 
in the woods all year round 
["Pineys," insider/ outsider] G—Vincentown; 23GT: 
The name "Piney" seems to have come from the people that lived 
in 
the woods all year round, and took on more of a regional 
characteristic than those people that lived 
in the town and had 
the benefit, maybe, of a grange or a church sewing circle: of 
more of a community. But even out here 
in the Pine Barrens you 
have places like Chatsworth G—Chatsworth; 27GT that were little 
communities in themselves. A Piney, then, I guess, would be 
someone that was not related to that close—knit community but 
that lived alone. 
TX06: 
We did go to one isolated house, Johnson Place, 
[Vernacular architecture] G—Possum Trot; 23GT, where his 
grandparents had grown up. 
It had been a small settlement of 
three or four houses (now only one), on a sand road off Sooy 
Place Road, near a place called Peachfield because there was a 
peach orchard back a ways from the road. 
It 
is now owned by Mrs. 
Walter Hitchner, widow of the author of The Iron—Hearted, of 
which she gave us several copies. It is an evangelical story of 
early settlement in the region, specifically in the author's 
family. 
The Hitchners apparently ran some sort of church retreat 
at one time, and were associated in some way with a Mrs. LaDuke 
in this capacity; this and the area are described in a historical 
book called Possum Trot, Brad thinks. The house 
is a log cabin, 
one story two room with a boxed tightwinder stairway and a loft, 
restored by the Hitchners so that the original construction is 
visible. Joseph and I will return with Brad and some of his 
relatives who grew up in the house to do an oral history 
interview and a detailed photographic study. 
TX07: 
As we drove, I asked Brad about the kinds of bonds that 
related families and individuals between townships in the area. 
He pointed out that it was more useful to look at voluntarism and 
interdependence than at kinship networks, because 
I don't think you can talk about blood lines, because any group 
of people who lived on top of one another for so 
long are going 
to be cousins 
if you go back far enough. And that's a very 
traditional, homogeneous settlement of Europe everywhere before 
indistrialization has hit us. What kept the . . . people together 
was . . . a need for everyone to band together to give or service 
each other. And the people to talk to would be my grandmother 
Thompson and the early organization of ther ambulance [folk 
medicine] G—Vincentown; 23GT. . . . She lent the money to the 
emergency squad to get . . . the ambulance. It was during the 
war, and 
it was hard to get an ambulance: they did rummage sales, 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 27 
cake sales, everything to get the . . . ambulance. They needed 
fifteen hundred dollars; my grandmother had 
it and lent 
it to 
them until they could get the money. And they went over to 
Burlington County Hospital, and she says she knew the lady over 
there and she got it for five dollars more than the people in 
Burlington, who were going to buy the ambulance. And the woman 
let them have it [instead] because there wasn't one for the 
entire Pine Barrens, and these women were going to service the 
Pine Barrens. And she has stories of leaving the cranberry bogs 
and going after people to take them to the hospital for babies, 
'cause . . . that was the first time this high tech started 
hitting the Pine Barrens. And she keeps saying that somebody 
accused her of going to the county seat without shoes on. 
C"Pineys," insider/ outsider], G—Vincentown; 23GT. That she went 
over there barefooted. And she said, "That comes from I was 
working in the cranberry bog and I had to get out -- I wore shoes 
over to Mount Holly!" Which 
is kind of funny, I think. We're very 
sensitive to people saying we're something else because of what 
we've done. And that ambulance, let's see, started in Vincentown, 
and Red Cross came out and trained people to give first aid. And 
the men were, 
in Vincentown, very instrumental. But women 
in 
the 
Pine Barrens seem 
to have had to take on several roles. If there 
was a truck that needed to be driven [women's work and 
activities] G—Vincentown; 23GT, whoever was there would drive the 
truck: 
it didn't matter, male or female. Same way with the 
ambulances: 
if someone needed to go out, whoever was there went 
out. I think that's very important. 
TX08: 
We then drove down south to Chatsworth to visit with 
Brad's third or fourth cousin 
Alva Buzby, now in the 70's or 
80's, 
longtime owner of Buzby's store. On the way down, we fell 
to talking again about land and its worth in the context of 
various traditional uses [land uses] G—Chatsworth; 27GT and 
G—Vincentown; 23GT. Brad explained that someone who owned a sawmill 
needed to own lots of woodland with cedar swamps in 
it 
in order 
to make the mill pay: people evaluated land 
in terms 
if the uses 
made of 
it. 
What the land was worth was the resources that you reap from the 
land. So you needed a good deal of 
land to run a sawmill. To get 
the cedar swamps and whatever, and that often came with other 
tracts. And after you leveled the land of 
its cedar trees, 
it 
sometimes went back to tax sale, sometimes was cleared for 
grazing: whatever you were into. 
CC: Because pine and charcoaling and gathering wasn't worth the 
money? 
BT: Well, that was much earlier. Charcoaling went with 
eighteenth—century furnace activities; coal, at the turn of the 
century, outdid the capacities of charcoaling. So then what you 
had was cattailing, cranberrying, blueberrying, . . . 
Brad's grandparents at one time had 900 acres of woodland, 
stretching from Johnson Place to Hedger House north of Chatsworth 
for their sawmill. This and other land 
in the Thompson clan has 
been sold, 
inherited through marriages in and out of the family, 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 28 
and back and forth between branches of the family itself. 
As we passed The Hedger House, now a restaurant, Brad talked a 
bit about its history. There was a small, old Pine structure, 
about half of a sixteen foot square with a peaked roof, behind the 
restaurant, which has been called "the Hedger house" for reasons 
Brad's not sure of (he thinks it was a tollbooth or something 
along those lines) for a long time. He added: 
Before that was a bourgeois place to stop off, and a doctor's 
income tax deduction for a losing business, 
it was a bar, very --
dangerous bar to go 
into: 
lot of fights there, locals would have 
a fight or whatever. Blacks would stop there on their way home 
from blueberry picking and get a bottle of wine at the day's end. 
We returned from this to the topic of blueberry picking 
techniques and jobs [blueberries] G—Vincentown; 23GT. Brad 
explained that as a youngster his job would be to pull 
the flats 
out of the fields for the old ladies. 
Then the overseer, the black overseer, who was responsible for 
bringing the busload of people to the farm, would help my brother 
give out the tickets or the tokens for the flats of blueberries 
on the back of the truck, and be 
in charge 
if anybody got out of 
line. And then of course all 
the old ladies took care of me, and 
I called them Aunt Sally, Aunt Maisie, Aunt whoever. And I can 
almost remember them calling me Master Brad at times. I can 
remember that. And they'd call my mother Miss Shirley: Miss 
Shirley and Master Jack. . . . I had no sense of violence from 
the black population until the late sixties, when we saw rioting 
on the television, and we were beginning to get streetwise to 
violence in the city. 
. . . The man who brought the bus out, I 
remember my parents saying that we weren't allowed to visit him, 
because his house would get torched 
if they saw white people 
going 
in 
it. And I wonder if that has anything to do with him 
exploiting the people in the city or in the country. He was shot 
one night in a bar, and my family buried him. And they were the 
only white people to attend Preston's funeral. And he worked not 
only for my parents but my grandmother Thompson, brought people 
out to the city. . . . So the old ladies, we would let them sit 
on a cranberry box [while picking], and kind of bend over. And 
other people made out better time bending over or getting on 
their knees. . . . picking the berries by hand. 
After meeting briefly with Mrs. Buzby, Cathy Pepper, the 
Postmistress, and with Al Morrissey, a young carver and decoy 
maker [carving] G—Chatsworth; 27GT, we drove south to Batsto, and 
north again toward Brown's Mills. I asked about Quaker culture 
surviving in Medford. G—Medford; 18GT. Brad said that a lot of 
architecture is still to be seen, but that the older residents of 
Medford have largely moved out due to the influx of upper middle 
class people to downtown Medford [social change, demography] 
G—Medford; 18GT. Many of the Medford Quaker families are now in 
Mount Holly. 
TX09: 
As we drove north on Route 206 through the Hammonton area, 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 29 
we discussed the truck farming G—Hammonton; 11GT and 
its relation 
to berrying. Sunday afternoons his family used to pile 
in the car 
and drive down this way to see what the farmers were doing: when 
the peach trees were in bloom; what the pepper people were doing. 
Farming was a pervasive interest and concern: "in your blood," as 
his father says. Vegetables were also shown at the farm fair, 
along with the gladiolus bulbs and peaches that are major crops 
in the area, which happened in the summer: 
And the farm fair Queen was a big deal . . . each high school, I 
think, put up a candidate. . . . Susan Cliver was 
in 
it one 
time. That was one of our packers in downtown Vincentown. You'd 
go on Saturday night and see her get crowned, and you'd buy a 
basket to sit on 
if you wanted to sit. Or you stood in the back 
and watched . . . And they'd have a question: you'd be asked a 
question, and I think a dressing competition: you had to wear a 
fancy dress. But that was part of the criteria: how you answered 
the question. I only remember one question, and Susan Cliver 
would be a good one to ask about this, or her mother. They asked 
her who had the most dramatic impact on her life, her mother or 
her father. I think that's what the question was. . . . I can 
remember her talking about it the next day. I think that that was 
a very unfair question, because no matter what she would 
say 
she was slighting one person or the other. 
G—Vincentown; 23GT 
[festive occasions]. 
He mentioned that Mrs. Hazel Poinsett of Buddtown, who has Quaker 
background, always wore a nice dress with a colored bib apron 
over it when she came into Vincentown. He got the impression from 
the way she talked about it that "that was what a lady did when 
she went to town" according to Mrs. Poinsett's upbringing.

TX01: Today I made a number of visits 
in Medford G—Medford Twp.; 
18GT , beginning with town planner Tom Scangarello and continuing 
with Recreation Director Eileen James at the municipal building, 
cranberry grower and concrete company executive Alvin Brick 
Senior, and Medford Historical Society member Mrs. X. 
While I 
was waiting for Scangarello, I had an 
interesting talk with his 
secretary Lee, from G—Medford Lakes; 17GT. She commented that this 
community has 27 lakes and a lot of natural wildlife remaining: 
raccoons still trundle across the roads and get into people's 
garbage; deer browse in 
ill—fenced gardens. There are beavers, 
water rats, and a large raccoon and muskrat population. (animal) 
She saw a kinship between the current experience of animal 
and human longterm residents: both, she feels, are trapped by 
encroaching urbanization. The irony of the community's current 
land use patterns and tendencies struck her as she talked on, as 
I nodded and took notes, not questioning or commenting much: she 
noted that because Medford Lakes 
is 
good farmland, 
it 
is a prime 
site for development: there are no trees to clear; no stumps to 
spend time and money rooting out. The land 
is ripe for housing to 
go right in, 
and it 
is economically much easier for developers 
than buying and clearing woodland. 
This gives her a feeling of 
helplessness and some sorrow, as well 
as claustrophobia and fear 
of the future of her home. 
Conservation. 
She has seen tremendous urbanization in the past ten years: 
the change 
is profound enough that she no longer really 
recognizes the community as the one she grew up 
in. Yet she 
commented that, from the perspective of an urbanite moving out 
there, 
it 
is spacious and countrified, though to her it 
is 
cramped and spoiled and hemmed in. 
This difference in 
perspective between residents came forth, like her other 
comments, spontaneously, without my raising the topic of "space 
and place" -- one of many instances of Pine lands residents' 
awareness of the idea that both are 
in the eye of the beholder. 
Insider/ outsider. 
Tom Scangarello is the author of the Medford Master Plan, 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 31 
which has won special recognition as a model municipal plan under 
the Pinelands Commission's general mandate, though it predates 
the Commission by a year or more. He 
is a native of Tom's River, 
and has some awareness of region—wide history, land use patterns, 
and 
local concerns. We spread out a topo map to start with, 
dealing with the Mt. Holly Quadrangle and the Medford Lakes 
Quadrangle. 
He characterized Medford Township as made up of 
agricultural farmland, 
lake communities, and woodland 
communities. North of Himmelein Road G—Medford; 18GT, about one 
third of the township, 
is truck farming, dairying, and a bit of 
blueberrying; the major landholders are the Bricks, who lease 
blueberry fields from dairy farmers Dietz and Watson; these dairy 
lands themselves; and horse farms, such as Circle K Ranch on 
Route 70, which have facilities for public horseback riding 
G—Medford; 18GT as well 
as breeding thoroughbreds and English 
riding horses. 
The richest land 
in the township is 
in truck 
farming G—Medford; 18GT, 
in the northwestern section of the 
township. This is traditionally in the hands of old Quaker 
farming families like the Bricks and the Haineses, some of whom 
still 
live there: this tends to be the area in which the oldest 
residents live. 
History. 
The next area going south 
is composed of 
lake communities: 
Lake Pine, Taunton Lakes, Deer Lake, which were originally 
settled in the early 20th century as summer resorts, after the 
farm region was already well settled. There are two generations 
of settlement now in these communities, and the homes average 
around 25 years old. The third area is that surrounding and below 
the borough of Medford Lakes, which is woodland communities and 
much larger lots of owned land. Newer residents, recently from 
Cherry Hill and Philadelphia, are living here, and the homes 
average about ten years old. Recreation, architecture. 
Ethnic population in Medford Township is Quaker, Italian and 
Polish Catholic, and WASP. The populations tend to be mixed 
throughout the area, and peoples tend to mingle as much 
in town 
as out of town. 
Age groups and income brackets tend to be 
geographically mixed also. Centennial Lake G—Medford Lakes; 17GT 
and Braddock's Mill G—Medford Lakes; 17GT are populated largely by 
people with inherited wealth, while the area south of Pipers 
Corner G—Medford Lakes; 17GT tends toward nouveaux riches. These 
two areas are differentiated in that the nouveau riche are much 
less involved in community life than those with "older" money: 
one does not see them at sporting events with their kids, for 
example, as one does those in Taunton Lakes and Deer Lake. 
Centennial Lake and Braddock's Mill each have clubs for 
residents, and tend to keep to themselves. 
Ethnicity, 
recreation. 
Social 
life in the lake communities centers upon children: 
there are all 
kinds of events and activities for kids organized 
by the communities and by the dept. of recreation for the borough 
of Medford Lakes: volleyball and softball leagues G—Medford Lakes; 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes

(plant) 
Ethnic and Church life G—Medford; 18GT is dominated 
demographically by Roman Catholics "and by every kind of 
Protestant .... the only things that aren't here are ... Jewish 
... 
and Unitarian." In Medford Lakes is a Protestant Community 
Church, "and that takes in everybody except Catholics." It's a 
small church that was Catholic until the Catholics built one "ten 
times bigger." Scangarello claims he 
is the only Italian in 
Medford. There 
is a Polish and Italian tendency to be Catholic, 
but he knows several who go to the Protestant Community Church. 
There are perhaps twelve black families in the township, and no 
Jewish people that Scangarello or his secretary know of. It would 
be difficult, they think, for a black family to move into Medford 
Lakes because there is much more prejudice there than in Medford. 
There are some Korean and Japanese families; he does not know how 
many. All 
he has run 
into are well acculturated, and speak like 
Americans.

Conservation. 
The Master Plan 
is based on areas of growth, 
intermediate 
growth, and nongrowth, and has been under revision and updating 
for ten years. The Pinelands Commission established there three 
types of areas according to environmental conditions which 
required some revision: 
in some cases, the Township's 
requirements were environmentally stricter; 
in others, the 
Commission's, and 
in all 
cases the stricter set was followed. 
(Parenthetically, this results in Scangarello's office being 
unable to pave the driveway around the farm buildings in which 
they are housed, because according to PC standards they had too 
much paving on the site already. He gave me a rather wry look as 
he apologized for the gravel.) There were some areas in Shamong 
and Medford Twps. which would have developed at "a very moderate 
pace" 
if 
the stricter standards of the Medford plan had not 
superseded the Pinelands Commission plan. The Commission's large 
number of applications from developers were approved in the past 
6-7 years, and those houses are now being built. "They had very 
little regard for .... the municipalities' capacity to handle 
that growth in terms of 
... police, fire, trash, and so on and so 
forth. 
Government. 
So now the municipality is faced with catching up with that 
growth; however there is no new money coming into the town from 
those new developments. So that the town feels they're strapped: 
you know, "How do we do this?" 
One of the virtues of planning is 
you, you never do that: 
... 
you moderate your growth coupled with 
that infrastructure and that money, so that you don't get ... so 
that you can't handle it. But that's exactly what's happened in, 
in 
those two towns. [see ACCO05 for full tape of this interview.3 
In the view of some local municipal boards, there exists a 
condition of "double jeopardy": they have the Pinelands 
Commission's environmental legislation to contend with on the one 
hand, and their own municipal budgets on the other. One area, for 
example, has very overcrowded schools since the new developments 
approved by the Commission have gone in, 
but there 
has been an 
enormous amount of difficulty in getting the Commission to 
approve a site for a new school to be built. Scangarello 
explained that he has had to explain in writing to the Commission 
why the site preferred by the community school board is a 
suitable one, and why some alternate sites are not acceptable. 
There are zoning conflicts, characterization of ecological area 
conflicts, and other problems alluded to by a general exasperated 
laugh. One problem is that if the Commission does not satisfy 
itself that all 
alternate sites are unacceptable, they may get 
pressured by 
landowners who would have liked to sell their land 
to the school. So he has to present them with seven sites and 
show why they have eliminated six of them in order to get the one 
they want. 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 34 
Scangarello gave a tentative recommendation of Rev. Richard 
Say of the Protestant Community Church as someone who may be 
aware of ethnic organizations or community affairs 
in Medford 
Lakes. He feels that one of Medford's great features is that it 
lacks these: the integrated life of the area, with most 
organizations and activities open to all, delights him. He 
recommended Eileen James of the Recreation Dept. of Medford as a 
source person on sports. On gardens and gardening G—Medford; 18GT 
he recommended a 70—year—old man 
in charge of gardening for the 
town, probably its hardest worker: Harry Sutton. James and Sutton 
can be reached through 654-2608, the town municipal planning 
office on Main Street. 
We drove together to this office, where Scangarello 
introduced me to Mrs. Gladys Cortazzo, who gave me a copy of the 
Master Plan, some maps that go with it, 
and an introduction to 
Eileen James. 
TX02: 
Mrs. James and I sat and talked in her basement office for 
over an hour while she told me all 
kinds of things about 
recreational 
life 
in Medford: programs for kids and families in 
the woods and 
in the parks; children's pastimes on their own 
in 
town; weddings and family and church picnics in the town park; 
and two important annual parades. 
My tape recorder batteries 
were low and lost part of the information on children's games and 
parades, but my memory seems pretty detailed and I have worked 
from that for those two sections; the rest of what follows is on 
ACCO05, side B. 
Recreation, (celebration), G—Medford; 18GT. 
The Wilderness Ways Program is a two—week program offering a 
total 
of five days 
in the woods for kids: this is the biggest 
recreational program in the Medford municipal system. It includes 
a 2—mile bike ride, for ages 7-15, to the small airport, and 
includes lunch and a plane ride; a walk 
in the Pakim Pond area 
woods G—Pemberton Twp., near New Lisbon; 21GT; and a canoe trip. 
Sometimes there 
is swimming. Parents supervise this and most of 
the program's activities. There is also an overnight camping 
trip. For this, the kids prepare their own menu and are 
responsible for packing a prescribed list of supplies. They help 
cook their meals on gas stoves provided by the Medford Dept. of 
Recreation. The emphasis is 
on 
low expense and high protein: 
peanut butter sandwiches, spaghetti, cereal and eggs and juice. 
There are usually about 15 kids in any given session, and 
it 
is 
offered four times every summer. 
(foodways) 
The Junior Women's Club runs a park program for three two— 
week sessions each summer, with arts and crafts, nature, music, 
and games scheduled each day. There is storytelling as well, and 
coloring with crayons. This is for grades 1-5, and, she guesses, 
involves 2-300 kids per session, 
in the Medford Park. The program 
is funded and the paperwork done by James and her staff; the 
hiring and running by the club. One of the major games G—Medford; 
18GT involved there 
is the water slide: they spread out plastic 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 35 
sheeting or big plastic bags and run water on them, and the kids 
run up to a strip of the plastic, jump onto it, 
and slide along 
on their feet or knees or backs. 
There is also a preschool program that meets at one of the 
local schools. These younger children have a snack provided for 
them by the program, and their days usually consist of art, 
games, stories, and playing outside. There are musical 
instruments and paints for them to use as well. They often meet 
in a school cafeteria. The program is three days a week for five 
weeks. Thursdays are usually devoted to a special theme: a Fourth 
of July parade, with flags and red—white—and—blue decorations as 
their art/ craft, and a talk about patriotism and American 
revolutionary history; the fire department, with firehat making 
and a visit from a fireman and the chance to climb around on the 
truck, with some discussion about how the siren is not a scary 
noise but a noise that means help 
is coming to someone; a visit 
from a policeman, ditto; a First Aid volunteer, ditto. 
Education. 
The first week ... was a Fourth of July parade. And the 
children wore red white and blue that day if they could,... and 
they will 
[parade] just in the school grounds, and I will provide 
them with flags, of which we have a hundred and some, and they 
all 
go around -- and they have balloons, and the whole theme of 
that week is being patriotic and thinking the fourth of July 
is 
coming and 
it 
is our, you know, our country's birthday, more or 
less.... 
Some of the parents come to watch;... 
it was publicized 
in our local newspaper, and we have pictures of 
it, 
of the 
children carrying flags .... 
[they have] the juice and pretzels 
... 
and ... their papers [and pictures] might have been red white 
and blue ... 
and each teacher could make up whatever they wanted 
to, 
so each child did not make the same thing, but specifically 
the theme was the Fourth of July. The second week I believe the 
theme was ah, fire prevention: 
... memorizing the telephone 
number and how to call 
the fire if you were alone, how to call 
the fire department ... 
and the firemen speak with the children 
.... 
Quite a few of them might have made fire hats . . . out of 
red construction paper, and whatnot; they have little axes; 
different things -- something pertaining to the fireman's coming 
that week. 
The contact numbers for the volunteer fire departments (there are 
two involved) and for the first aid and ambulance squads are 
listed in the Citizen's Directory for Medford Township, on file 
with project materials. 
Voluntary organizations. 
For first aid week, the children make up kits with band aids 
and cotton balls and other small first aid items. They bring 
these to the talk, and they go through the ambulance. In 1982 the 
trash truck came too, but the system has changed to mechanical 
pickup now, so this 
is harder to do now. Basically, all 
this 
is 
heavy socialization and adult—to child lore of a community— 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 36 
oriented kind, teaching information and attitudes and values that 
have to do with citizenship and the feeling of being part of a 
community that helps individuals. 
Virtually everybody I talked 
to today was aware of this stance in the community, enjoyed 
it, 
was proud of 
it, and felt it was unusual and valuable. 
On Wednesday evenings in the park across from the library, 
the recreation department shows family rated movies, and a lot of 
families come to this with children up to ten or eleven; 
occasionally teenagers come too. I asked Mrs. James if any 
farmers or cranberry growers or horse people let the children 
come to their farms, or came 
in to tell them about their 
particular type of farming. She said they couldn't transport the 
kids (why, I didn't find out) and therefore had no way to get 
them out to the farms, but she liked the idea of having farmers 
come 
in, 
and seemed to mentally file it for future investigation. 
The teenagers in town are much more on their own: the vast 
majority of the municipally organized activities are for families 
and younger kids. She cited bicycle riding as a common teenage 
sport, and just walking, and golf G—Medford; 18GT as big teenage 
activities that they pursue on their own or through voluntary 
clubs. With much less approval she also cited motorbiking or 
cycling and video parlors as pretty common. She sees a clear 
connection between involvement in these two activities and 
vandalism and petty theft, and cited a few specific cases in 
which her own son had known or been with kids so 
involved before 
he discovered golf. About the video games, she said that 
virtually all 
the families she knows have a few video games at 
home; 
it's the parlors she dislikes and fears. There 
is one 
in 
the mall where she often shops, and she has told her children it 
is off limits: she'll drop them off to buy a pair of jeans, for 
instance, and tell them she'll pick them up 
in two hours, but 
they're to 
look for jeans, not go 
into the video places. 
Crime, 
children. 
Joe Macleer (ph. 654-1463) is a school art teacher in 
Medford Lakes who runs the sports program, and maybe the whole 
recreation program, for that community. She notes that a lot of 
people in that area would love to come to Medford's recreation 
programs, but because they pay taxes separately, they have such 
services on a separate basis. 
Sandlot baseball G—Medford;18GT is a big thing, sometimes 
municipally organized. There are neighborhood teams, and self— 
chosen kids' teams, baseball clubs, and camps that offer some 
training as well. Sometimes street teams play each other in a 
sort of "world series" style playoff championship type of thing, 
but this does not sound as 
if 
it 
is centrally coordinated; I only 
got a very sketchy picture. 
The rec. dept. also organizes an art program, soccer, and 
tennis. There 
is swimming only at a couple of private membership 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 37 
clubs in the area, and a lot of people would like to have 
something more publically accessible; the lake in the public park 
is polluted and has been closed to swimming for about five years. 
Pollution. 
She characterized the township as very family—oriented, 
reminding me of Scangarello's mention of parents coming to sports 
events with their kids. She pointed out that most of the dept's 
activities are supervised by volunteer parents, including the 
camping and other wilderness activities. In spring or fall there 
are a lot of family sports going on: volleyball, tennis. In 
summer there are lots of picnics and campouts in Wharton State 
forest, and big family reunion picnics and church picnics, often 
with squaredancing or sports, 
in the town park. 
G—Medford; 18GT. 
(celebration) 
The park has lots of areas in 
it with both tables and 
cookout facilities (charcoal grills, I expect, or fireplaces 
under stone or concrete—floored shelters with a roof and 
supporting posts, though I haven't checked this out) and tennis 
courts or ball diamonds or open grassy areas for games, and these 
areas can be reserved for groups at no charge. A lot of the 
Quaker and WASP families in the area, the Mormon church, and the 
squaredancing group often reserve space for annual picnics, and 
an extended family reunion can easily involve 100-150 people. The 
common foods G—Medford; 18GT tend to be cold ham and chicken, 
potato chips and other snacks, Jello salads, green salads, potato 
salads, soft drinks or beer, and hot dogs, hamburgers, and 
various things to grill or barbecue; some folks go for sea foods. 
It's a big tradition around here. Civil weddings (performed by 
the judge) are often scheduled in the park, and lots of people 
have wedding pictures taken 
in the small wooden gazebo you can 
see from Main Street, right across from the municipal planning 
building. (People were eating lunch 
in 
it out of brown paper bags 
when I walked by, and there are a couple of pictures of this on 
file.) 
(foodways), (celebration) 
There are two major parades every year in Medford, Memorial 
Day and Halloween. The Memorial Day parade goes back at least 
eighty years, probably to the founding of the day as a national 
holiday, because Eileen James knows a man in his nineties who 
told her that they always used to give the kids ice cream at the 
end of the parade when he was a kid, just as they do today. The 
parade involves all 
the fire trucks and police cars; the 
ambulance; the cub, boy, and girl scout troops; people with 
antique cars; people 
in Western saddles and cowboy costumes on 
horseback (though actually there are a lot of English riding 
events and English—trained horses in the area, and why Western is 
considered the only appropriate mode for parading Eileen couldn't 
think); and veterans and civic organizations. They usually invite 
three clergymen from different churches, and each clergyman says 
a prayer at one of the cemeteries visited along the parade route. 
(It's hard to find clergy to do this sometimes because there are 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 38 
so many family reunions on Memorial Day, and lots of clergy have 
prior arrangements to be at something like this, or some other 
event. It's a terrifically busy time recreationally, with tons of 
private family and friends' stuff going on.) 
Originally, the parade concluded with the distribution of 
popsicles to all the children who participated in the parade; 
today it's 
ice cream in 
little commercial dixie cups. I asked if 
there was none for the adults, and she said 
if they tried to give 
it to the adults in the parade, or to all the spectators, they'd 
be feeding virtually the entire town. I'm not sure how this 
combines with all 
the other events people are apparently engaged 
in on this day. It's an 
interesting ending, though: the 
municipality sponsors this one, I think, and pays for the 
ice 
cream, with maybe some help from the Rotary, which 
is very active 
here. 
So 
in a way 
it winds up with the 
local government 
dispensing largesse (pleasurable, not necessities of 
life; 
festive food) to the youngest active participants in celebrating 
the war dead. This is a staunchly Republican area, I am told, and 
very patriotic.... it's just intriguing to me that ice cream and 
cemeteries and flags all 
go together in such a tightly woven 
celebration of such great stability over time. Apparently, 
Memorial Day parades are big all 
over the Pinelands, maybe all 
over South Jersey. I never even heard of one 
in Chicago, or 
Eugene, Oregon, or Boulder, Colorado, where I have spent various 
years. 
The Black and Irish kids 
in my Chicago neighborhood had a 
high old time at Halloween, with a huge bonfire of filched tires 
and gates and scrap wood, 
like the kids 
in outport Newfoundland, 
and 
lots of cheerful vandalism, but there was nothing like the 
community involvement of the Medford Halloween parade. It 
is an 
evening affair, beginning after dark, about 8 p.m. on the 
Saturday before Halloween. It has, 
like the Memorial Day parade, 
a prescribed route, but this one 
is shorter and more centralized. 
It starts on a small street near the western end of Main Street, 
where bleachers are set up for a judges' stand -- costume judges, 
and perhaps other types of judging as well. Anybody who wants to 
be 
in this parade can do so, and lots of mothers go pushing baby 
strollers, maybe with their wee tots dressed in Halloween 
costumes or with the strollers decorated in some fashion. A lot 
of civic organizations and high schools in the area build floats, 
with either a Halloween or a children's theme, as Eileen James 
called them -- parents' themes might be more folkloristically 
accurate, since they are often from storybooks read to children 
by parents, like Alice in Wonderland or Disney characters. 
Candy 
and gum are tossed from all 
the floats to the children, who 
scramble about picking it up. 
There may be some involvement of the fall queen chosen by 
the area's high schools, though E.J. wasn't sure: there's a big 
high school football homecoming week right before Halloween, and 
she 
is, I gather, either the homecoming queen or some kind of 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 39 
fall queen, chosen by vote on the basis of popularity. 
The 
parade and, I think, this voting involves the lake communities of 
G—Medford Lakes; 17GT as well 
as G—Medford; 18GT. 
Again, all the 
fire companies and volunteer organizations and scouts tend to 
take part as well, and march together. Sometimes more folks are 
in the parade than there are watching it. 
I got contacts for both parades -- the Rotary has more to do 
with the Halloween parade -- but we will all 
be away that weekend 
and may not be able to be there to cover it. I suspect there 
is a 
community desire to avoid razor—in—the—apple dangers associated 
in modern local 
legend with Trick or Treating inherent in this 
Halloween parade business, but on the other hand Medford seems to 
be the sort of place where you would find lots of folks wanting 
to be 
in a civic parade, so maybe they just like 
it better than 
Trick or Treating. Or maybe they also do that, the night before. 
It would be worth pursuing. 
TX03: 
After getting a look at a photo album showing children on 
a campout and getting a copy of the local Citizen's Directory 
brochure, I went out to do a little photographing. I came out 
onto Medford's main street, 
in the business district, and took a 
good look at it. 
Its houses had already gotten Carl Fleischhauer 
and Elaine Thatcher's attention when they drove through a couple 
of weeks before, and certainly it 
is rich in character. The homes 
were tall, stately, peaked—roofed, clapboarded, porched, with 
lacelike brackets on their posts' joints with the porch roofs, 
cut out of thin boards. 
Architecture, G—Medford; 18GT. 
In front of one of these, a man was mowing his lawn and (as 
Carl had asked plaintively for pictures of people doing things 
like mowing lawns, saying they are the rarest kind of pictures in 
most of AFC's studies, I asked if I could photograph him. 
When 
he heard that I was from the Library of Congress and was working 
on 
local history and culture, he was affable and willing to be 
photographed. He pointed to the For Sale By Owner sign that stood 
on his front lawn, and commented that he had lived there for many 
years, though he came originally from elsewhere, and liked 
Medford a lot, but he wanted to modernize and the town ordinances 
insisted that his house stay oldlooking. He was especially 
aggravated about having to keep the lacework brackets, which, he 
said, "most people wouldn't bother with." 
Aesthetics, 
government. 
The sun was shining and there was color everywhere: the 
lawns bright green with trees and flowerbeds; the stores housed 
in freshly painted clapboard buildings or clean brick. There was 
a small cedar gazebo surrounded by 
lawns and marigolds directly 
across from the planning building (which 
is 
itself a large old 
house, painted a dark marine blue). Two women sat peacefully 
eating lunch and chatting in 
the gazebo, and I used the telephoto 
lens to take a couple of pictures without getting close enough to 
invade their space. 
Next to the gazebo was a store in another 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 40 
old house, again surrounded by flowerbeds in bloom, with a straw 
wreath on 
its door and broom corn G—Medford; 18GT tied to 
its porch 
posts. Lace and gingham curtains were looped back with ribbon at 
its windows, and the sign advertised hand made dolls and other 
crafts. As I photographed the outside, a woman going in said 
hello and I explained what I was doing. 
She was Joan 
Fredrickson, a local garden club member, and she was immediately 
friendly and helpful 
in suggesting gardeners and craftspeople I 
might talk to. I jotted down their names and hers 
in my notebook, 
thanked her, explained I had a pressing appointment, and dashed 
off to find a bite of lunch before my 
interview with Alvin Brick 
Sr. 
A few doors south on Main Street, I found the Medford 
Village Deli, 
looking small and nicely crowded, 
its walls filled 
with new wooden shelves and its shelves filled with Italian 
foods: dry pasta, tomato sauce, bread, olives, pickles. 
Its 
dairy case, set next to a big bay window looking out on the 
street, was full of 
local 
and Pennsylvania brand butters and milk 
and cheeses: brands I had never seen or heard of, with some 
labels that looked as 
if they had been designed at least thirty 
or forty years ago: 
line drawings of cows, washed with 
watercolors; cherubic farm children in sunhats; stylized field 
flowers. 
A deli case and a cutting board, with shelves below, 
were tucked into a corner behind the cash register, and a man, a 
woman, and a younger man were busy with various slow—paced tasks 
there. The older man made some conversational comment about the 
two cameras slung across my shoulders, and suggested I take 
Greg's picture as he made my corned beef on rye. Greg was 
amenable, and I did, and took some interior shots as well. They 
joked about being 
in the national archives, and were pleased 
about the photography, especially when I offered them prints. It 
was their opening day, they told me, and they suggested I take a 
picture of the outside of the building, as 
it was a stage stop 
built about 1850. They were polite, friendly, and the sandwich 
(what I noticed of 
it, for I downed it 
in phenomenal haste as I 
prepared for my meeting and drove to Alvin Brick's office) was 
delicious. 
(foodways), 
interiors, marketing. 
Thus far, I was simply astounded by two factors in the 
interactions I had had: one, the friendly approachability of the 
people, and two, their positive, immediate response to the name 
of the Library of Congress and the idea of a local history and 
culture project. (This had become my phrase for self—introductory 
purposes, and 
it seemed to work fine.) There was none of the 
hesitancy or distrust I had come to expect, working in the core 
area of the Pinelands: no requests for identification; no tales 
of bitter encounters with reporters who tried to make them look 
foolish and backward. They were proud of their community, 
patriotic and positive about Washington and the government, and 
pleased that interest was being taken 
in their region and way of 
life. Apparently, Eileen James's "You're not considering Medford 
a part of the Pine Barrens, are you?" had a lot of community 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 41 
self—concept behind it: 
the Pineys and the Barrens are someplace 
else; something else. John McPhee did not go there; I heard no 
recriminations about the man who listened to "the biggest liar 
in 
Chatsworth," or about television reporters who wanted to portray 
all Pineys as being unschooled and dirty, with mice eating from 
the dishes on their kitchen tables, 
like those who had filmed 
Fred Brown's house. My 
introduction to Medford left me feeling 
that it was less self—conscious than Chatsworth, on the whole; 
had had less experience with reporters; and had security in 
its 
municipal self—esteem. 
Fieldwork. 
Medford also has more businesses called "Medford such—and— 
such" than any other community I have seen 
in the telephone book 
listings -- perhaps another indication of civic pride. 
TX04: 
I had to do a little back street searching to find the 
Medford Concrete Company, 
in spite of having gotten directions by 
phone from Alvin Brick when I made the appointment. I found it 
behind Kirby's Feed Store (owned, as I verified later, by the 
family that founded Kirby's Mill, on the other side of Route 70, 
in the 18th century). It was a silent, empty looking little 
complex of buildings off a residential street overshadowed with 
big sleepy oaks, 
its dusty workrooms full of stilled machinery, 
weeds twining around its walls, birds singing 
in the back yards 
on either side of 
it. I finally found Alvin Brick Sr. 
in an 
upstairs office, visiting with an 
insurance salesman who got up 
courteously and departed when I came in. Mr. Brick was ensconced 
behind an enormous desk, flanked and backed with fish tanks that 
bubbled quietly as we talked. He 
is primarily a cranberry grower, 
a father and son of growers, and reminded me much more of the 
quiet, somewhat hurt men I had worked with around Chatsworth and 
Hog Wallow and Tabernacle. 
Landscape, G—Medford; 18GT. 
We began with the topographical maps, and he showed me who 
owned which cranberry and blueberry fields 
in the region; what 
lakes used to be cranberry bogs; which fields were now in 
production and which were not. These have been marked on the topo 
map set in my possession and that in the project office. His son 
Alvin Jr., a Ph.D. 
in Environmental Science from Cornell 
University with a reputation for passionate ecological and 
farming commitments, was out harvesting cranberries on their 
primary active bog, near the West Jersey Cranberry Meadow on the 
Medford Lakes Quadrangle map. 
Betsy Carpenter had recommended 
him as a fascinating person, much involved in figuring out 
methods of biological control for pests and disease in berry 
agriculture as an alternative to spraying. 
(Some people, e.g. 
Betsy, Tom Scangarello, and Alvin Sr., consider him a bit 
extremist about this, but his anti—spray feelings are shared by 
Francis Mick and laborer Bill Wasiowich.) 
The Bricks also 
maintain a blueberry field in the southern tip of the Mt. Holly 
Quad, which they lease from Dietz and Watson, and a low—producing 
cranberry bog just east of the Jackson—Medford Road and west of 
Lake Mishe—Mokwa in the Medford Lakes quad, which they would sell 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 42 
for development if they could. 
On this bog 
lives Mr. Brick's 
father, Jay Rogers: the family 
is Quaker (though not particularly 
devout or traditionally minded according to him); he recommended 
his father as a good oral historical 
informant. 
(plant), 
conservation, pollution, farming. 
Alvin Brick Sr. sounded glum about the family's cranberry 
lands. Their primary holdings had originally been zoned for 
industrial—residential development before the creation of the 
National Reserve, and had been worth about $1,000 an acre 
if they 
had sold them; now, they have been zoned for forest preservation 
because the land is very environmentally sensitive, and are worth 
"virtually nothing." He feels that this gives the family a 
hemmed—in, optionless feeling that reduces their incentive to 
work the lands. 
If they had not had other options, 
like the 
concrete company he now puts most of his own energy into, they 
would have been pretty well bankrupted by the Pinelands Act. He 
says that many families are finding that their younger generation 
does not want to continue farming, or can't, or there 
is no one 
to do 
it. " After years of thinking, 'Well, 
if anything happens, 
I can sell 
it and have enough --' whatever "enough" 
is for 
different people -- but when you legislate that away, 
it's 
hard for me to see how fair it 
is." 
Government. 
Apparently, the developability of the land was a sort of ace 
in 
the hole for this and perhaps other farming families until the 
Pinelands Act. This comment reminded me of Denny Doyle at Tru—Blu 
Cooperative's explaining that farmers were given a choice 
regarding the future of their land when the Act was passed: they 
could open it to development now, or close it to development 
permanently; no 
in betweens. 
Many left their land open to 
development now, not because they wanted to develop it, 
but 
because it so upset them to think of leaving their kids with no 
options, depriving them of the right to do what they liked with 
the 
land when it came to them, that they saw immediate zoning for 
development as the lesser of two evils. It was the self— 
determination of future generations, not development per se, that 
they were choosing for -- and that at what Denny felt was often 
great emotional cost and general frustration. That's certainly 
what Mr. Brick was expressing. 
We wound over the topos, covering the location of other 
families' bogs, and he described a little about his dry 
harvesting method, G—Medford Lakes; 17GT using the Western dry 
harvester, and gave me a 1982 newspaper article with pictures and 
a more detailed description of Francis Sharpless's use of the 
same machine. This article is on file in xerox form with other 
project documents. He says Dietz and Watson's dairy farm is 
basically a tax writeoff -- a bitter comment, I thought, for they 
are newcomers to the area who may be doing better out of the land 
than longterm farming families are 
in his view. He 
leases one 
blueberry field from them. Insider/ outsider. 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 43 
He showed me which of the lake communities' 
lakes used to be 
cranberry bogs until 
10 or 20 years ago: Taunton Lakes, 
Centennial Lake, the southern half of Lake Stockwell, and Mimosa 
Lake. 
He said that Medford was surrounded by dairy farms 
in his 
childhood, thirty to forty years ago; his own family's dairy farm 
near Tabernacle was the last to close. 
As an 
illustration of a 
recurrent theme 
in his thought about regional change, he said 
that people had asked anxiously where they were going to get 
their milk when Bricks' dairy closed. The area adapted, adjusted, 
shipped milk 
in from the rich Wisconsin lands where you can get 
as much milk from one county as you can from all 
of New Jersey. 
He has confidence in the productivity of the USA overall, and 
does not fear a food shortage from the conversion of agricultural 
lands to housing and industry, as some other local farmers have 
told me they do. 
Medford's dairy and truck farms to the north of Himmelein 
Road are Quaker lands traditionally and, to a large extent, still 
are. 
I asked about Quaker life. 
He has belonged to one of the 
two meetings in Medford all 
his life, but his memories of 
distinctively Quaker custom and belief are either vague or 
private: he simply said they weren't all 
that devout and said 
little when I asked about family practices and values. He did 
mention that Mr. Edward Haines, associated with the Medford 
Memorial Community Center, still uses some of the old Quaker 
speech G—Medford; 18GT. 
Religion. 
He started off after a while on a story about his 
grandfather's experience with land speculators from Philadelphia 
who wanted to buy his farm: walked up to the house, with the farm 
in full production, with vegetables and cows and pigs and 
chickens, offered him a good price, and he sold it. Then the 1929 
crash hit and all hopes for development faded, and after a few 
years they came and asked him if he'd take it back, and he did. I 
taped this, though he leaned way back 
in his chair on the other 
side of the big desk and spoke very quietly, and 
it's a soft 
recording. 
See ACC006. 
History. 
One of the reasons Mr. Brick's family didn't use the Quaker 
speech is that his mother was raised Methodist, though she turned 
Quaker when she married his dad. He described himself as a 
"birthright Quaker," a term I recognized as meaning that one 
is 
born into the faith rather than converted to 
it, 
though I don't 
know if there's any status differentiation in the minds of 
local 
Quakers, or which would be higher status if there is. 
(The "God 
has no grandchildren" proverb of the evangelicals who insist that 
only personal conversion confers religious identity may well not 
be present among Quakers as an 
idea.) 
When the Ben Franklin Bridge went in 
in 1926 land 
speculators came in and got options on most of the land between 
there and Camden, and his grandfather's experience was replicated 
many times. Route 70 was built in 
1930-31, and everyone in 
the 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 44 
late twenties was expecting it to be solid city through this 
area: 
it was the Depression that kept the region rural. There was 
a twenty to thirty year gap 
in building and development in the 
area between that and post World War II. Even now, he feels 
Medford has changed very little since his own childhood: very few 
new homes 
in central Medford. He 
listed the few homes he 
remembers being built. In contrast, the lake communities have 
been built practically from the ground up within his lifetime. 
Until around 1940, the Bricks' cranberry harvest was picked 
by whole Italian families, who had finished harvesting the 
vegetable and grain on their own farms around G—Waterford; 30GT and 
G—Atsion; 22GT. It was a bit of cash income for them, and they used 
to stay 
in sheds built for them (first out of pine boards; 
later 
of concrete blocks) on the bogs themselves, bringing mattresses 
and blankets and cooking pots along. There were huge brick 
fireplaces with flat iron plates on top and ovens on each of 
their four sides for families to use at a central cooking 
location, and they baked bread G—Medford Lakes; 17GT and cooked 
lots of pasta and tomato sauce, and sang and told stories in 
the 
evenings. 
Ethnicity, (foodways). 
He was warmed to talking by the time I left, and we could 
probably have gone on, but I was pressed for time, so I left 
after an hour and a half or so and headed on across Route 70 to 
Kirby's Mill G—Medford; 18GT where the Apple Festival would be held 
in a few days. Sue Samuelson had asked me to take some 
photographs of the mill and grounds before the festival. I pulled 
up and went in to find a man and woman in their fifties or 
sixties working away with hammers and tape and signs, unpacking 
boxes of greeting cards with apple designs, putting up displays, 
tinkering. They were Mrs. X and Tom Chavis of the Medford 
Historical Society G—Medford; 18GT. Dr. Chavis is 
in aerospace 
research, but at the moment he was 
in shirtsleeves and old 
slacks, a carpenter's apron round his waist and a hammer in one 
hand. Mrs. X, brisk and friendly and knowledgeable, immediately 
began to show me around the mill and explain its history. 
She had founded the Apple Festival five years before, and 
chaired its organization ever since. She'd gotten the idea after 
holding a show of 
locally made quilts 
in the Mill, which is a 
spacious and beautiful 18th century cedar building, as a way of 
doing something at the mill, and something that would be 
different from the other fall festivals around the area. She 
allows only early American and, as of 1982, Victorian crafts to 
be demonstrated, displayed, and sold there: no balloons, no 
cotton candy, no electric rides. They get approached by people 
who want to sell things like these, but Mrs. X is adamant, and as 
about ten thousand people showed up 
last year, her tastes and 
feel for the festival's spirit and structure seem to have struck 
a popular chord. I went outside after we'd visited for a while, 
to take some exterior shots of the mill buildings and their 
setting. 
(celebration)

TX05: 
By the millstream, under a big tree by a bridge, two young 
black men were fishing and chatting. One came up the bank as I 
was walking that way, and greeted me kindly with "Hey, how you 
doing?" I smiled and said hello, and a few minutes later he 
commented from the bank that they were fishing with live crickets 
G—Kirby's Mill; 18GT. Taking this as an invitation to be curious, I 
answered, "This I've gotta see," and came down beside them 
cameras and all. Without bothering with introductions, they 
simply included me 
in the conversation that had been going when 
I'd come: they'd been to a bar in Mt. Holly that day where a man 
had shown them a stuffed marlin mounted on the wall, and tried to 
convince them that it was a baby porpoise. You could tell 
it 
wasn't because of the big fin running down its spine, Melvin 
said; he felt pretty hurt and insulted by this attempt to put one 
over on them. They had been 
in the Air Force together at Fort 
Dix. Peter was fishing while Melvin held the little plastic bag 
of crickets and handed them to him one at a time. (animal), 
recreation, (foodways), ethnicity. 
Peter was fishing for bluefish G—Kirby's Mill; 18GT; there are 
also pickerel 
in that stream, he said. He was fishing with an 
ordinary casting rod and filament line with a plastic bobber, 
casting in a deep hole right next to the bank. I was surprised 
that he could talk away so close to the fish and still be hauling 
them in, for he caught about six 
in half an hour, and never 
waited more than a minute for a nibble: he pointed out that his 
shadow was not falling on the water, and that this, not sound, 
was the fishes' cue to flee. "To catch fish," he observed, "you 
got to think like a fish." 
He cast his line slowly out about two yards, and drew it 
toward the bank with three fingers of his right hand, reaching 
down below the end of the pole; then he 
let 
it lie still. The 
bobber wobbled and dipped as a bluefish nosed the cricket. "He's 
tasting it," Peter explained. "Just like you, 
if 
he tastes 
something and he doesn't like the taste of 
it, he'll spit it 
out." Melvin added that the odor of the crickets was already 
in 
the water from several that had already been eaten by other fish 
there, for sometimes there are two or three bluefish—sized bites 
to a fat cricket. This was drawing the fish to the spot. The fish 
took the hook, Peter set 
it with a light jerk, and reeled him in: 
a fish blue and gold, flat—bodied, the size of Peter's hand. 
I'd 
often caught them in Michigan, on the Great Lakes; my dad always 
called them perch. He tossed him into a large white plastic 
bucket half full of water from the millstream, where one bluefish 
already swam in hysterical circles. They were pleased with his 
size. 
Melvin reached into the plastic sandwich bag he held tightly 
shut, and took another cricket, handing it to Peter. 
Peter 
showed me how he hooked the crickets, through the anus and up 
into the belly. His verbal explanation was as delicate as 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 46 
possible, probably because I was a lady: you hook them "here 
in 
the back." It was vital that the hook not touch the cricket's 
brain, or he wouldn't move about in the water and attract the 
fish. He was using small brown crickets, not big black ones, 
though he had a plastic lure 
in the shape of a black cricket that 
he wasn't using. He had no tackle box with him: just two poles 
and the bucket and the crickets, which Melvin said they'd bought 
at a bait store, though sometimes people catch their own. 
Fishing with live crickets is kind of unusual around the 
area, Peter said: 
lots of folks like to watch them and ask 
questions about it. 
He learned it 
in Louisiana, where he grew 
up, f 
i 
sh i 
ng for catfish. He f 
i 
shes for catfish in streams around 
Brown's Mills G-Brown's Mills; 21GT, where he now lives with his 
wife and young son. Peter is forty, but he 
looks twenty-three, 
acts twenty-three: only the peace about him has the feeling of 
that many years' development. When he mentioned catfish, Melvin, 
who isn't all 
that keen on fishing himself (says he could never 
be that patient), told me how Peter had caught a simply enormous 
catfish (holding his hands about sixteen inches apart) somewhere 
in the Pines a few months before. He had taken the fish home and 
put 
it 
in his deep freeze, and started calling up friends: "Come 
over and see the fish I caught!" Peter was grinning and fishing 
quietly, watching sometimes the bobber, sometimes the ducks 
landing and paddling on the water near the opposite bank. 
Peter loves the ducks. He 
lived in Philadelphia for a while 
and he has relatives there, but he would never move to the city 
again. 
He says the kids growing up around here have a much 
better equipment for living: 
like 
if they drop the bomb, those 
kids could survive where a city kid couldn't. 
His two-year-old 
nephew came to visit him a while ago, and Peter took him to a 
field of flowers, and the little boy was afraid to walk on the 
field: he was used to concrete and didn't know what to make of 
this strange surface. 
To Peter, that's terribly sad. 
Insider/ 
outsider. 
He was patient and pleased about having me take pictures of 
him holding up fish and hooking crickets, and I wrote down his 
name and address so that I could send some copies. I can't find 
my notes now, having separated them from the rest of the notebook 
because I was out of room in 
it, 
and had had to scatter my notes 
on this chat on assorted pages within it. 
It's my first and last 
time trying that strategy. 
Fieldwork.

TXO1: 
This morning early, I interviewed planner Stuart Brooks 
of Ragan Design Group, a Medford-based consultant for Evesham 
Township. He 
is young, articulate, and a suburbanite: he 
describes himself as culturally a member of northern Evesham, 
where he 
lives with his wife and perhaps a young child or two. He 
speaks with a quick pace, with no distinctive regional accent. He 
was trained as a landscape architect, and says he believes in 
planning with people as opposed to planning for them. His 
knowledge of the area focuses tightly upon land use patterns and 
development issues, but on these issues he has detailed and 
farsighted perceptions that range from regional policies and 
tendencies to what he called Weltanschauung among particular 
local 
residents and social groups. 
G-Evesham; 16GT, he said, has distinctly different north and 
south regions: 
its southern half 
is 
legally and ecologically part 
of the Pinelands, while its northern half is not. The southern 
half of the community shops, drives, and "looks toward" the towns 
of G-Atco; 32GT and G-Berlin; 3OGT while north Evesham "looks toward" 
Philadelphia. The south section has pines and ericaceous plants, 
a lot of standing water, and no open fields: 
it's woods. "a 
different world," he said. 
The Pinelands Commission has closed the southern end of town 
to growth. This suits the township fine, he said (meaning, I 
surmise, the people he works for as a consultant) because it 
makes the southern half of the city "more exclusive." In the 
south, you find older houses, and narrower, older roads with 
winding lanes and sharp turns, because they were built when there 
was less money and equipment around to get obstacles like streams 
and bogs out of the way, and roadbuilders tended to go around 
them where now they just move them. Roads are narrower, with 
fewer sidewalks and shoulders. Road names in the north tend to be 
"point A-Point B Road" type names, usually using names of towns 
they connect. In the south they are older names, often the names 
of mills the roads go to, or of families who own land over which 
the road passes or to which it goes. (There's a "Bill's Lane" 
about half a city block long that goes to farmer Bill Evans's 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 48 
house, for which I've done a PNAME entry.) 
Folk speech and 
naming. 
Tracts of 
land can still be bought in parcels of anywhere 
from a half acre to twelve acres, and so there is more individual 
autonomy about lifestyle: 
in the northern half, where neighbors 
are close by, people will complain and/or laws exist to keep you 
from having chickens or rackety machinery or junk or having weeds 
instead of a lawn. A lot of the residents in the southern half, 
though, 
like those 
in the north, have moved eastward from Cherry 
Hill, Camden, and Philadelphia within the last decade or two, 
bringing suburban concepts of what they want their community to 
be 
like: they want open farmland around them, but not farmers 
with pesticides and tractors; they want woods, but they also want 
to use nitrogen fertilizers on their lawns, and may not know or 
care that their use 
is 
illegal because the fertilizer gets into 
the aquifer and changes the Ph of the water, and hence the 
ecology of the woods. The lawn imperative is strong in 
local 
folklife. 
Conservation, pollution, 
insider/ outsider. 
Brooks stressed that these in—movers seem to feel that 
Evesham is their community: 
its history is their history; 
its 
character is theirs to shape according to their desires. They are 
a majority here now, and 
in fact are involved in a lot of voting 
and planning -- that is, 
one finds individuals on boards and at 
meetings who have been here ten or fifteen years and consider 
themselves typical of the primary group whose interests should be 
represented in municipal decisions. Older farming families, 
Italian Catholic, Anglo Protestant, and Quaker, have largely sold 
their land; those that remain do not have the kind of established 
money and social organization to make their desires and interests 
heard. Those farmers who remain do not come to the foreground to 
voice land use concerns at zoning and planning meetings; it 
is 
perhaps culturally atypical for farmers in America generally to 
do so, though I think there are always local specifics that 
affect who shows up at these things and who does not. He returned 
several times to the 
irony of the 
local situation, where you have 
suburban people moving in 
in great numbers (Evesham's population 
was doubling every year for a while, though it's reaching 
"critical mass," he said, and growth is tapering off now) who 
want to have farmlands around them, but they are making decisions 
that "push agriculture out" of the area without realizing the 
ultimate results of what they are doing. They think of their 
community as a suburban one, and make decisions that suit 
suburban values: nice lawns; stores and roads and services; 
cleanliness, good education for their kids, not too much noise. 
They do not make decisions that take into account the tractors 
and pesticides and odors and needs for large tracts of private 
land without roads going through it that go 
into keeping those 
picturesque farms in existence. Farmers are not reporting 
problems with vandalism, 
littering, or trespassing 
if 
they are 
having them -- perhaps, Brooks and I thought, because they don't 
consider it their community any more. He pointed out that the 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 49 
township laws are stacked against farmers because the abuses they 
suffer are culturally appropriate for the majority of the 
population: they are abuses that arise easily and frequently 
within suburban land use patterns, and "people aren't going to 
find themselves guilty." 
Government. 
To Brooks, the culture of the Pinelands is primarily 
explained by 
its ecology. The north part of town, where the soils 
are nutrient—filled clay, was originally Quaker farms: apple 
orchards and field crops. The southern section and the "barrens" 
of which it 
is ecologically a part are largely infertile for 
field crops except for cranberries and blueberries. The 
settlement pattern, when it was dependent upon such 
considerations, reflects this, and its core, the old community of 
G—Marlton; 16GT, 
is 
in the fertile soil 
region. (plant) 
The locations of farms still 
in operation in the region, 
along with 
what they grow and who owns them and how they relate 
to current and planned residential/ commercial development, are 
marked on the project office topo maps and on my set, covering 
the south part of the Clementon quadrangle and the north part of 
the Moorestown quad. Most of the farms 
in the township have been 
sold to 
land speculators G—Evesham; 16GT for development. The older 
farmers who remain are surrounded, with drainage problems from 
the new developments around them: storm rainwater, for example, 
runs into new areas where it has never been a problem before; 
sand and the small amount of salt used on the roads in winter 
fills farm drainage ditches and clogs them. This is especially a 
problem typical of farms near developments built 
prior to about 
1975, when environmental concerns began to affect engineering 
design, and people began putting detention basins 
in to catch 
storm runoff and sand. 
Water. 
Evesham is diversified, he said: 
it does not have a 
homogeneous "suburban" culture, though he gave some examples of 
values and tendencies in which he considers it "like anyplace 
else" or "like suburbanites everywhere in America" or "like most 
Americans." It has also passed through three distinct phases 
in 
its building and design tendencies, self—perception as a 
community, and general visual character. Originally a Quaker 
farms' service center, with shops and roads determined by the 
needs of a farming community, 
it developed by about 1960 into a 
suburb of Philadelphia, with lots of approved sites for 
development. During this second period, for example, a 7-11 store 
was built at the main intersection of the old community of 
Marlton, where Old Marlton Road and Locust Road cross. After 
about 1975, this would never have been permitted: preservation, 
historic and ecological, began to 
loom larger in municipal 
decisions. (I could use some clarification on who makes these 
decisions: should have asked.) Since that time as well, 
buildings, such as the public storage building at the corner of 
Marlton's new main intersection where Green Tree Road crosses 
Route 70, are designed to be visually pleasing, with "adequate 
Cartwright--$3 Fieldnotes 
page 50 
but not excessive" parking; trees around them; townhouses instead 
of spread—out bungalows. The concept of there being such a thing 
as too much paving is recent in Evesham planning and building. It 
is the in—movers who have brought this idea into the offices 
where decisions get made. 
Insider/ outsider. 
There are no "homegrown" local 
landowners with family money 
and social organization in this area, he said, because it 
is a 
field crop area -- field corn, soybeans, rye, barley, and wheat, 
all mostly for livestock feed -- and field farming has never been 
profitable in New Jersey; 
it's been declining all over the state 
for at least fifty years. The profitable crops in this region are 
strawberries, asparagus, and other specialty cash crops, and 
cranberry and blueberry agriculture, and there doesn't seem to be 
much of that. Route 503 from Chatsworth to Batsto, forty or so 
miles east, 
is the area where you find a lot of berry agriculture 
and (hence?) some growers who are politically informed and 
involved, 
like Stephen Lee Jr., Garfield and Mark DeMarco, and 
Bill Haines. Here, farmers seem to have had a real economic need 
to cash 
in 
on the escalating land values, and they have not 
gotten together to plan, bargain, or make decisions about land 
sales and uses. Bill Evans, the last big farmer in the township, 
did not have a network of other farmers to join with to do 
anything about the development as 
it grew around his land, and 
now, with King's Grant planned unit development (a huge one) 
being built a few miles east of him and traffic already choking 
the roads that loop around his remaining property on 
its w,ay 
to 
and from the lake communities in Medford Lakes Township, he 
is 
being asked to 
let a road go right through his back yard. This 
is 
the kind of situation that has been avoided in other areas where 
farming families with money and organization between them have 
gotten together to exert some control over development. 
G—Moorestown; 16GT, for instance, has old money and cooperation 
between farming families that has probably kept land off the 
market somehow. 
(plant) 
New development, changes in municipal 
laws, and general 
official culture changes always seem designed to serve newcomers, 
and yet the newcomers don't perceive themselves as newcomers: 
their identification with local history sometimes causes them to 
go to amazing amounts of trouble to avoid renaming roads or 
tearing down significant buildings. For example, the house on the 
Eves Plantation for which the town 
is named is 
in the middle of a 
new commercial development, but, 
instead of tearing it down, time 
and trouble was spent in arranging for it to be renovated and 
restored for use as an office. The road system there follows the 
old stage coach road to Moorestown. Similarly, people are 
concerned with keeping the character of Marlton, and attempts are 
being made to have it put on the national register of historic 
communities. If this succeeds, there will be some tax benefits 
that go with it, but the primary motives are attitudinal, not 
financial. Marlton, 
like Medford, 
is unlikely to ever be a 
practical, everyday, boot laces and potatoes kind of resource for 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 51 
local people to shop 
in because their particular kind of historic 
preservation tends to preclude things like supermarkets and 
drycleaners being right in town: these are on the highway 
outside. Inside the town the stores carry specialty items: they 
tend to be picturesque little places with high prices. Brooks 
commented that a new bakery had opened recently 
in one such area 
in which one can't buy a loaf of bread: tortes and apple pastries 
at a dollar or more apiece, yes; bread, no. 
It takes a pretty 
affluent and mobile population to be able to support that kind of 
retailing. 
Medford has half a dozen antique stores, too. 
(foodways) 
The olde village quality of both communities makes the 
displacement and decline of 
its agricultural families' 
lifestyle 
ironic to me. 
In Medford, you can still find a few of the older 
farmers congregating around the park bench in front of Johnson's 
clothing store, or at Kirby's Feed Store, or the barber shop 
between noon and three 
in the afternoon: these stores are a sort 
of 
loop for them, familiar, relevant to their needs, unlike the 
spruce little delis and florists around them. 
In Marlton, even 
that bit of behavioral 
legacy (as Brooks called it) 
is gone, 
making the careful preservation of the architectural 
legacy 
remind me of the song, "Whose Garden Was This?" 
As Denny Doyle, 
manager of Tru—Blu Cooperative, observed, many of the Pinelands' 
newer residents want to 
live 
in rural settings without living 
rural 
lives, and there are so many of them now, vocal and 
educated and politically active, that it 
is getting harder and 
harder for anyone else to 
live a rural 
life 
in the areas they 
have moved into 
in 
large numbers. If the character of the old 
agricultural communities was being "preserved" in terms of 
living 
cultural resources, there would still be old men hanging out on 
the park benches and 
in the stores. There would be more 
consideration of agricultural needs in municipal and regional 
planning. As 
it 
is, 
recreation and scenic preservation, valued 
and enjoyed by newer residents, are objects of preservation --
not farming, and not farmers. Yet the fields and the farm stands 
and the cows and the silos that are considered historic and 
scenic are created by, sourced in, dependent upon agriculture. 
There is a certain self—destructiveness about preservation 
policies that ignore agriculture. Brooks commented, as have a lot 
of blueberry and cranberry growers I've interviewed recently, 
that agriculture is not really among the things being protected 
under the Pinelands management plan. Realistically speaking, this 
neglect is bound to undercut the overall stability and viability 
of 
its culture and also, mutatis mutandis, 
its ecology. 
Aesthetics, conservation. 
The farmers that are surviving pretty well 
in Evesham 
Township at present are those who do direct retailing, rather 
than selling all their crops through a broker; who advertise and 
let people pick their own vegetables or strawberries or 
something; who are willing to put themselves in the public eye, 
which is culturally pretty atypical for farmers; who have well 
run farm stands staffed by their wives and/ or children or some 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 52 
other retail 
labor force; and who have diversified operations. 
Tony Russo's family 
in Tabernacle was one example Brooks 
mentioned of a farming operation that has adjusted well 
to having 
the System in 
its back yard, and having to deal with it and learn 
to use it successfully. We both smiled over mental pictures of 
the Russos' highway—side farm stand G—Tabernacle; 25GT with its 
rear area with big wooden sliding doors, the floor the proper 
height for a truck to unload crates of fresh produce onto; 
Grandmother in her black shawl 
in her wooden rocker, cleaning 
vegetables for retail sales; 
lots of grown kids working away at 
the same task, while just in front of all this dusty, farm 
activity are spotless, shiny retail counters and open coolers and 
freezers, with little packages of health food brand nuts and 
dried fruits on a small brass rack, and a computer cash register 
to ring up the sales. The Russos' place also has a ground level 
section just inside the front door that Iooks and feels and 
smells farmy: big bags of feed and fertilizer; rakes hung up on 
the wall for sale; hoses; bushel baskets and pecks of sweet 
potatoes and pears and peaches and onions. It's as 
if the front 
and the rear reflect farming culture, and the central section 
reflects ruburbia, and somehow the symbolic domains are 
juxtaposed in a way that works, reflecting the adjustment made 
in 
concrete matters such as those Brooks identified. 
Marketing. 
Ethnically, Evesham is Anglo, Italian, Mexican, and 
(increasingly and recently) Asian G—Evesham; 16GT. Roman Catholic 
churches are predominant, and there is a parochial school 
in 
town. There are lots of Protestants of various sorts. This info 
is detailed on two sets of survey data he xeroxed for the 
project, showing breakdowns by residential type, family unit, 
income, ethnic and religious identity for a one—mile and three— 
mile radius around the town. There's no heavy industry around: 
occupations are mostly office work, retail sales, and social 
services. There are lots of commuters to Philadelphia and Cherry 
Hill, for on the maps it 
is easy to see that Evesham is 
at the 
narrow end of a "funnel" of urbanization that pours southeast 
from Philadelphia. There are few job opportunities in Evesham for 
high school kids, though: there are paper routes, and lots of 
very organized sports and competitive athletic things to get 
involved in, and there are lots of video game arcades G—Evesham; 
16GT, but not much else for kids to do. There are some people in 
Evesham who might occasionally go to Atlantic City for the night, 
but the casino business has not drawn a significant number of 
people there for work, though 
if 
the casinos really boom, that 
may start to happen. I plan to call around and try to find a 
clergyman to talk to about church life: who talks to whom; 
whether there's a local church council; ditto for voluntary 
organizations, who's here and what they're up to. Ethnicity, 
religion, children. 
There's a lot of planning going on for facilities and 
services for the elderly, building on the church structure of the 
community. At present, Evesham is rather in transition between a 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 53 
traditional cultural 
system, 
in which families and churches took 
care of old people, to an offically organized system. A lot of 
older people are living 
in rental housing, and rents are getting 
higher, and some of them don't have transportation. There are 
three planned "life care" units slated to go close to the local 
hospital, and the municipality has bought a bus that older people 
can call and make appointments to be driven to various places. In 
the future, he thought maybe some housing or financial assistance 
might be arranged to solve the problem of inflationary rents for 
retired people on fixed incomes. There 
is at present no civic 
center for crafts, meetings, or get togethers for senior 
citizens: a YMCA or someone's large parlor might have served this 
purpose some years ago. Some of the Catholic churches have Bingo 
G—Evesham; 16GT one or more nights a week, and the Wylie Mission 
Church has a nonprofit live—in community for the elderly. The 
life care centers will 
be run for profit, though they're aiming 
at a middle class market, and won't be 
luxury priced. 
The trash dump for Evesham is 
in the Pines region, but, 
like 
a lot of other municipal dump sites, the new state solid waste 
management program is causing closure. All 
trash is supposed to 
go to Florence Township in Burlington County (outside the 
Pinelands) now, and people in Florence aren't too happy about 
that. Several townships are starting recycling programs to deal 
with the situation. 
Re—use. 
Like the majority of people we've all 
listened to 
in 
the 
region, Brooks had some experience with and comments about the 
Pinelands Commission. In one case he was involved in, a tract of 
land with a lake on 
it 
(a manmade lake, 
like all 
the lakes 
in 
South Jersey) was being subdivided. The traditional cultural 
approach to the problem of the lake would have been to create a 
small burn, or dump the soil moved 
in the forest land. Instead, 
the Commission required that the fill be dealt with by excavating 
a big four—foot—deep detention site, which created a great deal 
more ecological disturbance than the traditional methods would 
have. There have also been a number of cases he has been involved 
in or heard about in which sites with different degrees of 
environmental sensitivity and proximity to development were 
subject to 
identical regulations: wetlands buffer zones to 
protect their ecology from development impact are often required 
to be the same size, regardless of the relative sensitivity or 
developed—ness of the wetlands themselves. Site—specific analysis 
is hard to come by, because the Commission is understaffed and 
lacks the expertise and time to do them -- but also people 
sometimes feel that the Commission just doesn't listen, and 
is 
unwilling to accept even very sound, practical, well engineered 
alternative solutions when they are offered by people who do have 
the time, the knowledge of a site, and the expertise necessary to 
do that kind of evaluation. The Commission's central raison 
d'etre is to protect the aquifer, and they have planned 
thoroughly for development and preservation based on water 
levels; other topics 
apparently haven't had the benefit of as 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 54 
much attention. We keep hearing people say they're frustrated by 
dealings with a Commission that is spread too thin, 
is 
responsible for more than it can do well, sometimes wastes a lot 
of time and holds up a lot of processes, and wants to make 
municipalities responsible for things like scenic and 
archaeological resource management that they're not equipped, 
financially or 
in terms of expertise, to cope with. 
Government. 
I was struck, here as at other points in the interview, by 
point after point at which the views of a young suburban planner 
and those of an elderly cranberry grower like Francis Mick were 
in accord. Their assessments of the state's failure to manage its 
recreational 
land adequately, to get enough facts before making 
decisions about agricultural 
land and landowners, and of the 
specific impacts of suburbia/ ruburbia on rural Pinelands 
folklife are remarkably close. Denny Doyle of Tru—Blu and Brad 
Thompson of the Thompson blueberry family in Vincentown were 
pretty close to these two 
in their comments on these topics as 
well. All have been notably prone to talk about specific 
experiences, laws, and instances 
in discussing big abstract 
issues like government, farming, and culture change, too: 
abstract thought is there, and strong feelings too, but the talk 
about them is anything but abstract. People have had plenty to 
say and a lot of people so far seem to be saying the same kinds 
of things, sharing the same frustrations and fears about the 
future of the region, aware of the same kinds of problems. We're 
finding diversity too, but Medford's historical society folks and 
recreation director are unique in my experience at this point in 
that they seem peaceful and happy and secure in their community. 
Predominantly, people aren't expressing that kind of feeling: 
they're worried, faced with real present problems and clear 
future ones. It's the specificity and concreteness of the worry 
and the frustration that I find important and striking. 
TX02: 
FIELDWORK ISSUES 
This afternoon I came back from my interview with Stuart 
Brooks thinking long and hard about the project, 
its methods, and 
its goals. As has been our general team tendency, I intended to 
get right to work writing field notes on the interview, rather 
than talking with the other team members: we have yet to have a 
session, formal or informal, when we trade experiences and 
perceptions of the region 
in any thorough or deliberate way, and 
our conversation has tended to focus on non—project topics or 
practical details of camera operation, map marking, errands, and 
logs. So I came 
in expecting that no one would feel 
like talking 
about the issues I was trying to think through. However, Mal 
and 
Tom arrived a few minutes after I did, and we wound up talking 
for an hour: 
it turned out that they were thinking along similar 
lines. What are our ultimate goals? Are we 
in fact doing research 
designed to meet those goals? What do people seem to think about 
us doing research in their lives and communities? What kinds of 
factors in our goals and methods will make a difference in how 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 55 
welcome project workers will 
be when it comes time to do the 
extended case studies? Does anyone have any feedback from local 
gossip about impressions of us and of the project? What themes 
seem to be emerging so far in 
local thought about the region? Are 
we asking enough questions and getting enough concrete details on 
the whats and whys of these themes? Is the actual concern of the 
project with accountability to the communities of the Pinelands 
enough to satisfy those communities, or have informants seemed to 
want more from us 
in terms of focus on their concerns than we are 
able to give? Do the project workers feel that they have enough 
team coordination or communication, or are we working more or 
less with independent knowledge of our regions and topics? Should 
anything about this change to make the work and the workers 
better in any way? 
I found that Mal had called Mary to ask about the structure 
and goals of the project, feeling that he needed clarification. I 
remembered that Sue had taken a call from him the night before 
during which he asked that question, and she had called out to us 
that he wanted to know what the structure and goals were. We'd 
laughed, because none of us felt that the project had clear 
structure or well—defined goals in practice. While we knew that 
we were still 
in our vacuum cleaner stage of data collection and 
survey, and that the goals on paper were clear, the actual sense 
of direction and focus and purpose has not been as clear as we 
think 
it should be. This was one of the main themes of our talk 
in the project house kitchen today. We talked over the goals 
stated on paper: documentation of folklife and recommendations 
for land use planning. I said I felt we needed to do some 
thinking to make sure we actually attained both of these goals: 
in the area of documentation, I am concerned that Joseph's 
photographic data may not wind up forming an informationally 
rich, culturally revealing, detailed, 
integrated part of the 
project's archivable results, because he thinks like an artist 
and not like an ethnographic photographer, and because he 
is 
unwilling to correlate visual with verbal data when working with 
another project member. He likes to shoot independently, so that 
one cannot , for example, go through a detailed work process with 
an 
informant explaining and demonstrating, and expect Joseph to 
be there documenting the process. I am also concerned that my own 
fieldnotes (if not anyone else's) have been so general 
in their 
foci and sense of purpose that the data most relevant to the 
project's ultimate goals 
is not always as clear and organized as 
perhaps it should be. When I talk to a postmistress or a woodsman 
or a black fisherman, I have come home and tried to record as 
many aspects as possible of the whole interaction; looking back, 
I now think that in many cases, subtleties about the individual's 
sense of place; detailed facts about his land use habits or 
experiences; his comments about environmental 
legislation or 
social change as he has experienced it, should have been stressed 
and detailed more. Someone else reading my notes might well not 
be able to catch what that person felt and why he felt it on the 
very issues we want to be the most revealing about in our 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 56 
regional documentation. 
Tom and Mal shared my concern that the project actually meet 
its goals, which we all 
think are good ones: 
important in the 
eyes of our informants, and central to the actual future, as well 
as the present, of the region. Tom saw regional concerns (that 
is, what people around here think 
is 
important for the state and 
the Pinelands Commission to 
learn from our reports) as the 
context of the project, and folklife as 
its content within that 
frame of reference. I saw the reverse: 
if I were working 
independently here, I might well think more along those lines, 
but my sense of the Center's purposes, to which I want to 
contribute appropriately as a Center researcher, make folklife 
the context and local concerns a part of that frame of reference. 
Elaine argued that local concerns are not our affair at all: that 
we are here as observers, and that a cornerstone of our 
"objectivity" as researchers is to stay distanced from local 
concerns. Mal was a bit closer to Tom's position and mine: that 
we can and should document and describe those concerns as part of 
the regional 
life and character we are here to study, though he 
has run 
into fewer people who will tell a fieldworker their 
concerns than I have, and expected that we wouldn't necessarily 
be able to get at them much. 
Tom and Mal and I also discussed what factors are involved 
in ensuring that our fieldnotes do what they're supposed to do. 
Elaine said that we should just write everything down, keep 
asking questions, not turn off the recorder when we interview. 
Mal 
pointed out that that's not enough: 
it helps ensure 
completeness, but we cannot humanly document everything, and who 
we talk to and what questions we ask have to be thought through 
in terms of goals and foci. I thought privately, though the 
conversation was in full swing and I didn't wedge the comment in, 
that we could use periodic talks between team members as a group 
to help us refine these goals and methods as we go along, and as 
we gain a sense of regional tendencies and themes. I'd love to 
know more about what Sue and Jens and everyone else have been 
doing, and what they have learned; where they are confused; what 
kinds of feelings and thoughts they've been hearing from 
informants, what social relations they're finding in the areas 
where they're working. I'd love the practice myself at putting 
things into words: often, a comment from an 
informant or another 
project worker articulates something I've noticed but not 
perceived clearly enough to write well about it. Having to get 
comprehensive and summarize for other fieldworkers would help me 
write better notes for the project, and probably help me do 
better fieldwork too, improving my feel for what to ask about and 
how; what issues are likely to be sensitive to whom; what social 
networks to expect in the areas outside my survey territory when 
I start doing thematic work. I've made the suggestion of having 
dinner as a team once a week with the explicit purpose of 
discussing what we've been doing that week and what we plan to do 
next, trading suggestions and bouncing perceptions off each 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 57 
other, but so far it hasn't happened. I don't have the authority 
to call such a meeting, so I feel that the best I can do for now 
is to start conversations like this one from time to time; to ask 
about other people's fieldwork and thoughts when we get a chance, 
and ask for input on things myself. 
This conversation did not resolve much, but it aired a lot: 
we know now that three of us care about making sure we have 
coherent and well—supported data that can be used later by the 
Center for making land use management recommendations, or 
recommendations for the protection or interpretation or 
celebration of cultural resources. We know, too, that three of us 
feel that a generalized folklife focus 
is a bit too broad to 
ensure that we actually do that and do 
it well: 
it scatters our 
energies and our sense of focus to the point where specific 
topics that are central to at least one of the project's stated 
goals (or even to all three) may wind up being handled in 
too 
vague or scattered a manner to be useful. I think that, even 
though we have specific thematic areas to cover, the project 
could do with some periodic team sessions to coordinate data and 
perceptions of the region, and all 
our research and writing could 
do with more directed, clearly grasped efforts to gather and 
present the data that is going to serve those three major goals. 
I think that a lot of American folklore/ folklife scholarship, 
sometimes including my own, has tended to describe local 
life 
without always explaining the events, the laws, the ecological 
and economic factors that shape it. Here, I find that it 
is 
precisely these kinds of factors that berry growers, woodsmen, 
planners, housewives point to and want to tell me about. They 
don't just tell me how they feel about, say, a retirement 
community or a new planned unit development, or about canoers. 
They tell me specifically why they feel 
the way they do: they 
talk about a particular zoning change and how it affected their 
own 
land or family; about lawn fertilizers used 
in the retirement 
community or stream channelization by the developer of the 
planned unit that affected agriculture or water supply or 
wildlife. It seems to me that the norm for my discipline would be 
to describe and analyze what they feel, their attitudes and 
perceptions about insiders and outsiders, who's a newcomer and 
who's a Piney, without going into detail about areas like these. 
Yet if I am to document folklife and sense of place, I am leaving 
out a crucial area of how people think, and why folklife is the 
way 
it 
is, 
if I don't talk about zoning and ecology and land 
prices and who's on various governmental committees. I suspect 
that one response, 
if I do, will be: "That's not folklife; that's 
sociology, or political science, or economics." 
But it's part of 
the way people talk about folklife here; 
integral to what they 
say when I ask folklife questions. As a researcher with 
professional ethics, I will have to describe these things and 
attend to them with the same thoroughness I give to work 
processes or recipes or yard measurements, but how to do it 
is a 
good question. I think these kinds of details are of direct 
relevance to the project's goals, but I am not sure they are part 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 58 
of the project's methods. I worry, because if I write or talk the 
wrong way about these details, I may not sound as 
if 
I'm doing 
what I was hired to do; I may not sound like a folklife 
researcher. How I put things seems to be pretty crucial. 
The final concern I raised in this conversation, though we 
didn't really discuss it beyond the simple statement of the 
issue, 
is that I've had an awful 
lot of 
informants -- socially 
diverse informants -- express strong positive feelings about the 
project when they feel we are listening carefully to their 
concerns, and strong negative feelings about previous research 
which chose its own foci, unrelated to what people in the area 
think should be researched and written about. I've had several 
experiences in Chatsworth, Tabernacle, Vincentown, and the areas 
between them when an 
informant summarized what they'd heard about 
us or about me from someone they knew. I think that if we give 
people the impression that we are not particularly interested in 
writing about the fact that their taxes have tripled since the 
state has bought so much ratable land out from under Pinelands 
municipalities; about the nitrogen fertilizers that are being put 
on 
lawns and upsetting the Ph of the streams and aquifer and 
affecting berry agriculture; about vandalism of farmland and 
woods by tourists, some of the major gossip networks in the area 
may report bitterly that we're just one more bunch of researchers 
pursuing our own goals, and doors will be closed to us when it's 
time for the extended case studies. I would like to see these 
issues, and the facts relevant to them, 
included to some extent 
in our reports, though we can certainly handle them in the 
language and context of folklife documentation. I think this 
is 
the sort of nuts—and—bolts detail that make "local sense of 
place" and patterns of folklife more than just interesting things 
to read about: they offer insight into concrete issues that can 
have something done about them, and help show some causal and 
contingent relationships between the local folklife and ethos and 
the big, "government—sized" decisions that have been made 
in 
the 
past and will be made in the future

TX01: TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH TOWN PLANNER FOR SHAMONG TOWNSHIP, 
MR. LYNN HEINHOLD. SURVEY. 
I phoned Mr. Heinhold by previous arrangement, when he had 
set aside some time to talk, and went through what has become for 
me my basic set of questions for these survey interviews. My 
interviews with Stuart Brooks of Evesham, Tom Scangarello of 
Medford, and town clerk Winnie Haines of Tabernacle and his wife 
Mary have all 
developed in more idiosyncratic directions, as we 
got onto topics of special interest to them or to me, and 
explored particular facets of the individual communities they 
knew about. I am therefore going to organize this set of 
interview notes as a basic guide to my own methods in survey 
fieldwork, so that the questions I asked and their sequence can 
be taken as representative of my core modus operandi 
in case 
anyone ever wants to know what it was like. Some of the answers 
digress in what I think are also interestingly common directions: 
the way 
in which one topic leads to another here 
is worth 
treating as an example of common patterns in thought on these 
topics. 
Q. What are some of the major interest groups that you 
interact with or have to take into account in planning? 
A: 
1. Housing development G—Shamong; 22GT residents who have 
been 
in Shamong for ten years or less form one very vocal group: 
they are accustomed to more municipal services than they get 
here, and tend to voice wishes for them -- or, occasionally, 
resist them. This gets detailed later. 2. "Old timers" 
in truck 
and berry agriculture G—Shamong; 22GT are much quieter and tend not 
to turn up at municipal planning meetings. Newer residents only 
really turn out 
if 
an issue 
is 
up for consideration that directly 
affects their own development (but it's interesting to me that 
they KNOW when these issues come up. Do the farmers know? I 
should find out about this, say from Tony Russo.) There are 
usually about five people at a township committee meeting 
G—Shamong; 22GT. 3. Developers. The township doesn't seem to wind 
up dealing with them directly very much, as far as Heinhold could 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 60 
assess, because they have to go to the Pinelands Commission for 
clearance to do anything first.(At present, the rule 
is that 
there must be 3.2 acres per house, unless the development is 
going to have a small chemical sewage treatment system of 
its 
own.) 
Government, insider/ outsider. 
Q: Who are some of the old families in the area? What kinds 
of 
land use are they engaged in? 
A: The Abrams family consists of several brothers who have 
farms 
in the township. Both the Millers and the Abrams (this 
would be Fred the Elder and Fred the Younger Miller; see my RLOGs 
008-012). Everett Abrams was on the zoning board until a short 
time ago. 
Q: Who else is here? 
A: Twenty years ago the population of Shamong itself was 500 
people; now it's 4500 -- mostly from Philadelphia and Cherry 
Hill. 
Q: What are some of the occupations and ways of using land 
that are common among the newer residents? 
A: Basically, the older residents live off the land to some 
extent and the newer people don't. The price of farmland is 
connected with this: 
it's prohibitive unless you inherit it. 
Developers can and will pay a lot more per acre than people who 
want to farm the land could ever manage: say, $5,000 per, as 
opposed to $1,000 at the most. 
Q: What ethnic groups are here? 
A: WASP, Italian, and Irish heritage immigrants have come 
in 
the 
last twenty years. Economically, they tend to be very 
dominantly "middle management types." A lot of people have been 
transferred to this region by the firms they work for (though to 
me , Christine Cartwright, that doesn't account for them living 
in Shamong rather than Philly/ Cherry Hill). Lots of people 
in 
wholesale 
and manufacturing. The average house price around here 
is 
in the $75-110,000 range, so you only get folks with that kind 
of money. 
Ethnicity. 
Q:What used to be where these homes now stand? What kind of 
land are they built on, and how did 
it change hands? 
A: Farmers have tended to sell their woodland, not their 
productive ground, unless there is no heri (inheritance) 
G—Shamong; 22GT. Also, home buyers (that is, developers' market) 
want wooded settings rather than open farm ground for their homes 
because a relatively small parcel of ground around the home seems 
more secluded from neighbors if 
it 
is wooded than 
if 
it 
is open. 
(I would add that it probably also feels more like the kind of 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 61 
ethos people probably have in mind when they decide to move out 
here -- fits their dreams of the Pine Barrens better. But 
interestingly, Denny Doyle -- I think 
it was Denny -- pointed out 
that farmland is attractive to developers because you don't have 
to spend time and money digging trees out of 
it before you can 
build on 
it. So what we have here 
is an interesting, 
if slightly 
puzzling, juxtaposition that ought to be sounded out with a 
developer in the course of this study.) 
Q: What kinds of churches are 
in the area? 
A: The oldest is the Indian Mills Methodist Church G—Indian 
Mills; 22GT, near the general store. A new one 
is Shawnee Baptist 
Church, and it 
is the biggest and most active church. 
Plans are 
underway for a new Roman Catholic church 
in Tabernacle (which I 
have heard mentioned by Medford planner Tom Scangarello, Winnie 
and Mary Haines, and a couple of people who'd just kind of heard 
about it). There's also a new nondenominational church 
in Atsion 
G—Atsion; 22GT. 
Lutheran, Jewish, Roman Catholic, and Quaker 
residents of Shamong currently go to Medford to go to church. 
Q: What about clubs and voluntary associations? 
A: There are hunting and gardening clubs and a Veterans of 
Foreign Wars lodge; they came to the township and asked for a 
piece of 
land to build a lodge on and we gave 
it to them, and 
then later they asked for a liquor license and we figured if they 
had the license they could recoup the money the had had to borrow 
to get the land and the building together, and it's worked out 
very well. It's a nice place to meet. There's a Rotary, sports 
association, and a grange G—Shamong; 22GT. 
Q: 
Do you know anyone I could talk to 
in the fire company or 
the emergency squad? 
A: Paul Miller is president of the Indian Mills fire 
company. (He gave me the phone number.) The emergency needs (e.g. 
ambulance) are met by the emergency volunteers at Medford Farms. 
Q: 
Are there any other townships that Shamong has a lot of 
family ties, or work ties with -- a lot of traffic back and 
forth? 
A: Family ties exist with Medford and Tabernacle. There's a 
really heavy rush hour traffic that pours southeast out of Cherry 
Hill and Philadelphia through Medford and the lake communities 
and 
into Shamong. 
(This sounds more suburban than anything else 
anyone has said to me about life 
in these communities -- sounds 
like the route out of downtown Chicago up the north shore of Lake 
Michigan, where my folks lived when I was young, except that 
there it's pretty well solid concrete all the way, and here it's 
not.) 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 62 
Q: Who do you think might know some good gardeners and 
woodsmen we could contact? 
A: Mostly people who grew up here know about gardening: 
newer residents fall under the Pinelands Commission's rulings on 
not cutting down trees, and since they live on wooded lots they 
can't really grow very much; 
it's too shady. Oakshade Nursery 
(ph. 268-1502) might know some woodsmen. 
Q: What kinds of recreation go on a lot? 
A: Mostly what you see 
is soccer, baseball, girls' softball. 
Q: What about in the woods? 
A: There's hiking, camping, four wheel drive vehicles and 
motorcycles. 
Q: What about parks? What do people do there? 
A: There are no town parks. As for family reunions (I'd 
explained about Medford's penchant for family reunions 
in 
the 
park, which I'd heard about from its recreation director, whom 
they have to see to reserve space there), since most people own 
3/4 of an acre, they'd be 
likely to have gatherings like that at 
home. 
Q: How about yard sales? (I should have asked about roadside 
and home businesses as part of this too.) 
A: There are some times when a development will have a yard 
sale all 
together, and people take advantage of the attraction of 
more buyers by the group publicity. Other than that developmnents 
rarely if ever do anything together.

TX01: This evening I telephoned Mrs. Alice Tomlinson of Medford, 
on the recommendation of Leah Haines, who answered the phone at 
the Medford Memorial Community Center when I called. 
Mrs. 
Tomlinson and her husband Ephraim, she said, could tell me about 
Quaker traditions G—Medford; 18GT 
in the area, and also about 
Medford itself, because Mr. Tomlinson was mayor up until about 
four years ago. They asked me to come this evening because they'd 
be busy later in the week, so I went out to their home about 
eight—fifteen, hauling a Nagra, two cameras, a microphone kit in 
a huge duffle bag, a clipboard, and my shoulder bag. I arrived on 
their doorstep looking like I had everything but the kitchen sink 
with me. 
Mrs. Tomlinson met me at the door, 
immediately friendly and 
outgoing, bent with age, whitehaired, smiling, 
in a colorful 
skirt and a black cardigan sweater. Their house 
is huge and 
rambling and over 250 years old, at 51 Union Street, 
in what has 
within their lifetimes turned from farmland to town street. It 
is 
a red brick building, with wide lawns around it, 
and a dignified 
white sign on the front door says Ephraim Tomlinson, Counselor at 
Law, for he has his office, replete with a couple of secretaries 
and a xerox machine, 
in one of the back bedrooms upstairs. Mrs. 
Tomlinson showed me all 
over the house, half before the interview 
and half after. 
"I collect things," she said simply. 
Architecture, yardscapes. 
I'll 
say she does. 
There is a Wapiti's head -- similar to 
an elk, with about a five foot spread of antlers -- low on the 
living room wall, with a green and red felt conical hat perched 
on 
its head that says "Ephie" 
in 
red letters across its brow: a 
gift from a civic group when he stepped down as mayor. There is a 
basket made from an armadillo's shell strung from a red rope that 
also bears brass goat bells hanging by the fireplace. There are 
clock and knickknacks on the marble topped dressers and tables, 
crocheted seatcovers on the wooden chairs, pillows on the couch, 
old photographs framed on the walls and the piano where the music 
would go. There are plastic orchids mounted on tiny plastic oval 
backings on either side of a china plate that someone painted for 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 64 
her, with her name and the date, when she retired as a 
schoolteacher, on the wall of her bedroom. Her sewing room 
contains a music box -- an old Victorian one, I guess, made of 
mahogany, with a hand crank, and brass disks that you put on, 
like a miniature carillon. There is a cider press and baskets and 
more crocheting and more handmade old pillows. There are two 
lovely black silk Quaker bonnets of her grandmother's and two 
fawn silk and linen shawls, and a child's red velvet and lace 
bonnet. Ephraim is 
interested 
in family history and genealogy, 
and has huge thick volumes on the history of the county, and a 
filing cabinet out of which he pulled such treasures as the court 
records of the Boston trial 
of one of his ancestors, which 
resulted in her being beaten across the bounds into Massachusetts 
for her Quaker beliefs, and a xerox of the painting of Washington 
crossing the Delaware, 
in which he pointed out an ancestor who 
was apparently sitting on a knothole in the boat so Washington 
wouldn't get his feet wet. 
Interiors, history. 
We covered the past and present activities of the Grange 
G—Medford; 18GT and the Rotary G—Medford; 18GT; foodways at Grange 
suppers, which Mrs. Tomlinson cooks for; some ecological 
issues, 
for Mr. Tomlinson worked hard for ecological zoning while he was 
mayor; traditional farm family values and illustrations thereof; 
and a lot of rambling history. I will detail this on the RLOGS 
CCO14-17. 
The greatest frustration of the evening was that Mrs. 
Tomlinson kept directing my attention away from herself, putting 
her husband in the spotlight and getting uncomfortable whenever I 
turned to her. She used her hands, her eyes, and verbal commands 
to me to pay all my attention to him, saying that she didn't have 
anything to say, which was anything but true from my point of 
view. I will obviously have to go back when he 
is not there to 
avoid running on the shoals of this dynamic in their 
relationship. 
Women, men. 
The one time she interrupted him, she said only a sentence 
or two, and then said to him, 
"I 
interrupted, Ephie. I didn't 
mean to," and was quiet. Mr Tomlinson never objected, verbally or 
nonverballly that I could see, to 
interruption, and was 
in fact a 
pretty slow talker, with a soft voice and no overt assertiveness 
in his manner. It 
is Mrs. who has the liveliness, and actually 
the more coherent trains of thought. But she wanted to defer to 
him, and 
it was simply too threatening for her to accept the 
spotlight. 
Even before he came, she stopped 
in her discussion of 
childhood on her father's farm (no mention of her mother!) to 
say, "I'd better stop talking now; Ephie'll be home soon and 
he'll tell you a lot better than I can." 
Whenever she was alone, 
and occasionally when she commented, her voice was eager and 
clear and she was as friendly and welcoming as could be. "You 
make yourself at home, dear, come back any time," she smiled to 
me at the door as I left, and also on the phone before she even 
met me. 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 65 
Her touch is visible 
in the small objects around the house, 
and the decorations at the door: there 
is a basket of seashells 
and dry flowers and squashes, a wreath made like a flat ladies' 
garden party hat, and some tall grasses decorating the front 
porch. It 
is a busy, cosy, old house and she 
is a busy, cosy old 
lady, out to Bingo one night and Rotary another. His touch 
is 
visible in the heavy old furniture, the piles of books and 
papers, the law business and 
its trappings, some of the prints on 
the walls. The house looks more like a partnership of equal 
voices than their management of the interview would perhaps lead 
me to believe. They both seem happy and 
in 
relatively good 
health, though Alice, again, 
is healthier and probably younger. 
She mentioned to me, showing me family photos, that the 
missing leg that keeps her husband on crutches (he doesn't like 
wearing his artificial 
leg) came from being run over by a train 
when he was eight. He didn't have the 
leg off until after they 
were married, because it wouldn't heal. They also have a brain 
damaged son with a cataract in one eye ("you can see the cataract 
in 
the photograph," she said as she told me about him) who now 
tion of him" and placed him there, and he's happy, going to 
school and working in special settings. They had him at home for 
a long time, but there was nothing to interest him here. Their 
other son died of spinal meningitis, measles, and scarlet fever 
all 
at once when he was eight, and they still mourn, I think, 
from the way they spoke of Joey. 
There is among the family 
photos in her husband's bedroom (where there is also a bed for 
their son living in Camden) a photo of Ephraim as a small boy, 
climbing a ladder in a garden, "when he still had his legs." It 
is probably important to them because of the legs; that is what 
she pointed out in the picture. 
They were in some ways an anomaly and a new window on the 
area and 
its politics and sentiments and social groups: they said 
things I haven't heard before. For instance, Mr. Tomlinson thinks 
Medford has improved while the other communities of the region 
have (except for Haddonfield and Moorestown) declined. I don't 
know anyone else that has said Medford is 
improving, but then he 
was 
its helmsman during the crucial years of growth. He 
is not 
from here, but says he's been accepted. (See Elaine Thatcher's 
notes on her interview with another "accepted" leader, Floyd 
West, on this question.) They also said that the newcomers have 
chosen to fit in with the oldtimers' way of 
life, while to Tom 
Scangarello and Stuart Brooks, Medford has been overrun with what 
Brooks called "sportique" stores and community ethos and self 
concept to the point where farmers can't really see it as their 
community any more. Yet his folks had the dairy farm where a big 
shopping center is now (its name 
is on tape and it's mentioned in 
some of our project literature), and he says he won't go there; 
can't stand to go there. The loss of the farm, of the old 
baseball field, of the grange are painful. The loss of 
land and a 
way of life that was on 
it and of 
it are painful too. 
I can't 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 66 
totally figure out this ambivalence. 
Mrs. Tomlinson brought the bonnets and shawls down to show 
me; she gave us some literature on 
local Quaker history; she 
speaks to school groups about history; Leah Haines, she said on 
the phone, 
is always giving her name to people. Ephraim helped 
found the Rotary here; he got the library going; he was 
instrumental 
in keeping the trees in Medford so numerous, and 
knows his ecology of the Pines and cares about things like 
keeping photosynthesis and natural filtration of storm runoff 
through the sandy soil going 
in the Pines. 
They are friendly and 
would welcome a followup visit and picture taking of their 
incredible home, and I found them comfortable to be with.

These notes continue my notes FCC1023, which explain how I 
came to phone May Berringer in the first place. An acquaintance 
of hers had heard our presentation at the New Jersey Folklore 
Society on Oct. 23, and felt that the environmentalist point of 
view was underrepresented in my own presentation, so I asked her 
for a recommendation of someone she felt I should listen to, and 
she gave me May's name. So I phoned as soon as we got home from 
the presentation, and this is the gist of May's comments. All I 
really did was explain how I came to call her, and say "oh, 
that's interesting," and "It sounds like you really have been 
involved in these issues for quite a while," and other responsive 
remarks, so the flow of her thought is self—directed. 
The information recorded here 
is sensitive: personal names 
are mentioned and individuals maligned, so care must be exercised 
in the use made of this document to avoid causing local tensions 
-- or incurring charges of slander. The individual quoted is May 
Berringer of East Sooy Road, Woodland Township, New Jersey, phone 
(609) 859-2723. 
Ms. Berringer has lived 
in this area about 30 years. At 
first she was 
in favor of having a larger governmental authority 
come 
in when she built her home here in the early fifties. She 
watched how local officials were "hellbent on development": 
Woodland's planning board members had "no education or 
experience," and were being railroaded by developers. She has not 
been all 
that happy with the methods employed by the larger 
governmental authority -- the Pinelands Commission -- now that it 
is here, and feels that it has gone off track from its original 
goals due to political pressure, especially since the current 
governor, Kane, replaced Byrne, whose administration brought the 
PC into existence. Kane is more in favor of development than of 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 68 
conservation, and the Commission now seems to be more interested 
in compromising with local officials (e.g., townships) than it 
used to be. For instance, she says that some Pinelands 
"villages," such as Chatsworth, were not supposed to be allowed 
to expand more than a mile (or was 
it half a mile? I forget) 
beyond their center, but Whiting's G—Whiting; 51GT has expanded way 
beyond that limit, and the Commission isn't "drawing the line." 
Woodland Twp. has not complied with this requirement very well, 
either. Woodland has had three master plans, and the one 
it has 
now (the 1976 model) 
is 
"a development plan" that gives a lot 
more leeway than she'd like to see to urbanization: in fact it 
"rewards speculators for development" (I don't know how). She 
feels that some attempt has been made to preserve the local 
culture and way of 
life (that is, 
the "Piney" way of 
life) , but 
she doesn't think 
it CAN be preserved: 
it 
is going to change, 
come what may. (She defines a Piney as a gatherer, and argues 
that there are very few Pineys left.) 
In 1977, a developer had the permits and was starting a 
major development in Woodland: 1,000 acres total, 500 of which 
were 
in the preservation zone. 
It was to be a senior citizens' 
community of 5,000 people. "We fought it," she said, "and we 
won." Now the PC says that a developer whose work was stopped by 
the creation of the national reserve had until January 1983 to 
file a hardship waiver, which would allow him to go ahead and 
build 
if 
it meant he was going to 
lose his shirt if he didn't. 
This particular developer didn't file one, but now they've 
extended the deadline, and she's pretty worried that he just 
might 
Berringer ran for mayor of Woodland at one point, and 
it was 
Garfield DeMarco, chairman of the Republican Party for the 
township, who fought her. She claims he got her off the school 
board, too. She views him as very pro—development, and has 
attended meetings at which she says he called environmentalists 
Communists. She says that, from her perspective, the Pinelands 
Master Plan does not have tight enough controls on growers: 
farmers are allowed to use any kind of herbicides or pesticides 
or other chemicals; to out down cedar swamps; to 
increase their 
cultivated acreage; to build homes for their employees and family 
members. Any area that is considered farmland is given "double 
credits," and therefore certain growers could conceivably make 
millions of dollars if they ever chose to cash in their credits. 
(This refers to the development credit system, on which I am 
embarrassingly vague as yet.) The idea 
is that, 
if 
the 
developmental credit bank ever gets off the ground in Burlington 
County, the county freeholders will buy a person's credits for 
his land 
if he 
is 
in financial hardship. She agrees with Jim 
Tripper of the Environmental Defense Committee in New York City, 
who argues that it 
is not necessary to compensate people for 
their losses 
if you put environmental controls on their land and 
land use; 
if zoning changes or stricter legislation is passed, 
it 
is not something to demand compensation for. 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 69 
She says that the State of New Jersey has always been a 
major environmental offender, especially when it comes to 
managing its 
lands. The Atsion Lake development is a case often 
pointed to by environmentalists in this regard. It 
is a sensitive 
wetlands are, but it 
is state—owned, and an artificial sand beach 
has been created for swimming and sunbathing; modern facilities 
with poor septic systems have been put in, which allow sewage to 
drain into the lake. 
It violates Pinelands Master Plan rules on 
how close development can be to wetlands. Another example of 
state offense is New Lisbon State School on Route 72 G—Four Mile; 
27GT. Its sewage system is faulty and old and has been 
in need of 
overhaul for years; 
its sewage drains into Burr's Mill Brook, and 
downstream from it, cranberries are being harvested using that 
polluted water full 
of raw sewage. She and others have yelled at 
the state for years to do something about that sewage system. The 
state correctional facility nearby wanted to expand its buildings 
and take more people, but that was one battle they won: the 
evironmentalists' coalition wrote to Governor Kane and protested, 
and the institution withdrew its application. 
Mark DeMarco, Garfield's lawyer brother, has been Woodland's 
solicitor for the whole 27 years she has lived here; she 
associates this fact with Garfield Demarco's having been chairman 
of the Pinelands Environmental Council, which preceded the PC. 
Its Master Plan was "a developer's dream" that allowed for one 
house per acre, regardless of wetlands or any other ecological 
consideration. Funds for that council were cut off by the state, 
but Burlington and Ocean Counties put up the funds to keep it 
going. It was only an advisory committee and had no power to 
enforce its recommendations, and spent a lot of taxpayers' money 
paying a staff and surveying and mapping the region. She feels 
that G. DeM. maintained indirect influence 
in the council even 
after he stepped down as chairman. She regards him as basically 
opposed to regional planning: a fighter for independent decision 
making by 
landowners, and himself a "land speculator" who bought 
a lot of acreage. 
As an example of DeMarco family machinations and land 
speculation in Woodland Township, she cited a case 
in which Mark 
DeMarco brought up a new zoning plan in which 27 acres would be 
rezoned from preservation to residential medium density; 
it 
turned out that he owned most of that acreage himself. Mark 
DeMarco also owns land between the ocean and the heart of the 
protection area, and, she says, has talked about cashing in on 
the transport of offshore oil 
if 
it 
is found off New Jersey, 
hoping to be the one to build and own the wharves and equipment 
and buildings needed in that event. I haven't heard anyone else 
mention this. 
She also argues that cranberry growers tend to claim all the 
land they own as headlands for their bogs, but one grower 
owns 
little half—acre plots 
in the middle of Chatsworth that can't 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 70 
possibly be headlands for anything, and they pay the low headland 
tax rate on that property, depriving the township of fair 
revenues. This situation was, she feels, engineered by the 
grower, who had family connections in government. 
She says 
that some of the growers' political allies have become 
disenchanted with them after finding out about this and other 
related matters, and that there are some who are changing their 
registration to Democratic "just as a slap 
in the face to them." 
She claims that Marvin Matlack, a school board member whom she 
says 
is becoming a "folk hero" 
in Chatsworth, has reversed 
positions and now holds her point of view. She alleges that one 
grower comes to Chatsworth on election days to make sure "his 
people" vote; that he spends all 
day at a house across from 
Buzby's Store, and intimidates people at the polls. 
She also 
says that he 
laughs at her in public meetings. 
On a more environmental note, she commented that the rivers 
are suffering from overuse by canoers. People living here do not 
want recreational 
land holdings increased, and she objects, 
like, 
she thinks, many others 
in the region, to the presence of 
thousands upon thousands of tourists who are not regulated at 
all.

TX01: Content: general thoughts on recreation and agriculture as 
they affect the sense of place and relationship to the ecology 
in 
some of my 
informants' 
lives and thought. 
Also insider/ outsider 
themes. 
The dual focus on recreation and agriculture looks 
very promising, given the focus we have for the project. 
Several 
of my 
interviews so far have dealt with both subjects, and the 
juxtapositions that have emerged have been fascinating and, I 
think, are leading toward some pretty deep insights into how this 
place works -- or how parts of 
it work -- where nature and 
culture interact. So far, though I have more focused interviewing 
and thinking to do before the picture comes clear, I have noticed 
an 
intriguingly consistent set of patterns in the way socially 
diverse people talk about the land and the region from the 
general perspective of work and of play. 
The most immediately noticeable pattern is that, 
in talking 
with town planners Stuart Brooks G—Evesham; 16GT and Tom 
Scangarello G—Medford; 18GT; ex—dairy farmer and ex—mayor and 
grange member Ephraim Tomlinson and his wife G—Medford; 18GT; with 
Denny Doyle of Tru—Blu Blueberry Cooperative Association G—New 
Lisbon; 21GT; with recreation planner Eileen James G—Medford; 18GT; 
with cranberry grower Francis Mick; and with developer and berry 
grower and deer hunter Kenneth Yates of G—Tabernacle; 25GT, a dual 
sense of relationship to the 
land itself, especially its forests, 
emerges. They have all 
spoken of the "wilderness" and the land 
itself -- cultivated and wild, but not built on -- as a living 
thing with muscle and bone; almost with a heart and mind. It 
is 
an organic system in their minds, as 
it 
is 
in the scientific 
ecological perspective. They all 
seem to talk about working with 
it, 
understanding it, playing in 
it, harvesting it, as 
if they 
are secure 
in the confidence that it 
is bigger than they are, 
old, stable, balanced in and of itself. Their fear is unanimously 
directed toward the influence of a culture which does not relate 
to the land in this manner: which sees it as a blank page to be 
written upon 
in brick and concrete, or as a pristine wilderness 
to be framed, enshrined, to which human desires and needs must 
bow. There 
is a subtle but, I think, strong similarity and 
connection in the ways in which these diverse people have talked 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 72 
about the Pinelands Commission on the one hand, and suburban 
sprawl on the other: they see similarity between the worldviews 
expressed in these two patterns of perceiving and acting in 
the 
Pinelands, opposed though their ideologies seem to be. 
Conservation. 
These individuals have expressed the view, 
indirectly but 
clearly, that the Commission and the outside developers and 
entrepreneurs share the common desire to do things TO the 
Pinelands or FOR them, rather than WITH them. 
Man 
is the actor 
in their play; the Pinelands are the scenery and the setting. For 
my 
informants listed above, the Pinelands are active rather than 
passive; the ecology has dynamics of 
its own, and must be --
well, danced with, not stepped on. 
Eileen James's idea of 
recreational planning involves a lot of focus on letting the kids 
get out in the woods and learn just by being 
in them, and from 
listening to people explain and show them creatures and leaves 
and plants and places. It's as 
important for her -- and 
in the 
same socializing, preparing—for—citizenship kind of importance --
as teaching them about firemen and first aid. 
Francis Mick and Denny Doyle get passionately excited 
talking about how the land responds to proper handling; sad and 
angry over instances of mismanagement, when it 
is asked to do 
things it cannot do, when its fragility is not guarded or 
its 
strength and resilience used. 
Kenneth Yates gets frustrated 
about the fact that in areas where the 
land could easily support 
homes, no homes are allowed to be built because of over— 
generalized, non site—specific zoning; he gets just as upset 
about the legal 
requirement for a septic system type that he 
thinks is flawed and will pollute the land, or about the 
management of deer herds which allows for too much killing --
especially the killing of halfgrown fawns. Broken beer bottles 
along the rivers, the vandalism of farm equipment in Yates's and 
Haineses' blueberry fields, are all 
part of the same invasion: 
the invasion of people who think organically by people who think 
mechanistically; of countrythink by citythink. 
This 
is not my independent analysis of what's thematic in 
the views of community and ecology held by various groups within 
the area, but my effort to distill the essence of what these 
individuals I have talked with have expressed thematically; their 
definition of the crucial differences between "us" and "them." 
They tend to focus on instances which highlight this difference 
when talking about past and present lifestyles typical of the 
communities in which they live, regarding both interpersonal and 
people/ land relations. "We" know how the ecology works here; we 
work with 
it appropriately, leaning on 
it where it 
is resilient 
and strong; protecting it where it 
is fragile. "We" go ahead and 
use herbicides when they don't mess up the Ph of the aquifer, 
knowing that here we can safely lean on the natural system to 
increase the productivity of our land, where "they" put nitrogen 
fertilizers on their Kentucky Bluegrass lawns because they don't 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 73 
know and don't care about either the land as working land, with 
an agricultural job to perform for the whole country with which 
they are interfering by changing the Ph of the water supply. "We" 
know the old sand mines where you can ride a motorcycle around in 
the soft sand and dirt and have a whale of a time without hurting 
a thing; "they" bring four-wheel-drive vehicles down working sand 
roads and rut them up to the point where nothing and nobody else 
can get through. "We" always canoed on the rivers, and drank 
their water, and used it to flood our cranberry bogs; we shot 
wild ducks for food, not sport, and we would never have dreamed 
of 
leaving beer bottles strewn all 
over the banks, or breaking 
fences, or starting fires; "they" do all 
these things, caring for 
the pleasure of the moment, consuming and spoiling beyond the 
land's ability to recover. "We" the people have always wanted to 
preserve and protect the place which is our home and gives us our 
livelihood; "they" the Commission are so busy protecting tourists 
and tree frogs (the two protectorates most often mentioned, and 
with the most bitterness) that they are stopping us from doing 
what has always been done here, while letting the Pines be 
changed beyond recognition and damaged beyond recovery. "I was 
trying to preserve it, protect the land from erosion, and they 
stopped me," was the gist of one man's reaction when the 
Commission prevented his filling in 
an old gravel pit in his back 
yard. 
"I would put in a good septic system if they'd let me; they 
insist on one that I've seen leak time and again," said Kenneth 
Yates. The Commission strikes these people as a citythink force, 
like the outside developers: perhaps less predatory and better 
intentioned, but just as uncomprehending of the relationship 
between land and people, just as unwilling to 
listen to 
traditional knowledge and site specific analyses, just as 
uninterested in democratic decision-making, just as prone to 
impose its vision of what is best for the land upon others, even 
if they argue that they share its goals and could improve its 
realization of them. 
(animal), government. 
Recreation is a key element in 
land perception that ties 
suburban sprawl and the Commission together in the eyes of some 
of the people I've interviewed: both perceive the Pines as 
recreational space, and that is the overarching definition of the 
ecology as a resource. The same emotional quality, the same 
specific kind of frustration, seems to be expressed when Francis 
Mick talks about the tourists who fill the rivers with their 
canoes and beer bottles, and when he talks about the Commission's 
land use legislation. He canoes; he hunts; he stood by the Wading 
River and caressed the mossy side of a cedar and spoke of the 
stream as he remembered it, drinkable, quiet, fully alive, with 
an aesthetic appreciation and attachment that was anything but 
anti-recreation or anti-preservation. It 
is the shallowness of 
the way the land has been perceived, and therefore handled, that 
puts the fear and the grief into his voice. 
If these people I have quoted got together to present one 
recommendation, I think its thrust would be that the Park Service 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 74 
and the Commission should learn themselves, and try to teach the 
recreational users who live 
in cities or have recently moved here 
from cities, to deepen that perception of place to 
include three 
more facets. 
1. 
It 
is working land, to be kept strong and 
healthy to produce food and commodities that benefit everyone. 
Therefore, the number of people allowed to use it recreationally 
should be controlled as well 
as building, and more rangers are 
needed to stop littering and the destruction of agricultural 
equipment through carelessness or vandalism where recreational 
land and agricultural land border one another. 
2. 
It 
is a 
natural/ cultural system, where traditional ways of handling the 
land are as vital a kind of 
information for the accomplishment of 
its preservation and protection as 
is scientific knowledge. 
Therefore, these traditional methods and perspectives should 
become part of tourist brochures and rangers' guidelines for 
recreational users, along with information on what mushrooms are 
poisonous and where the scenic spots are. Tourists should be told 
whose land to stay off of and why; they should be told where the 
producing farms are, and what they contribute to the national 
crop of each food they grow, so that they might perceive the land 
as a natural/ cultural complex, to be appreciated as a unity. 
3. 
It 
is community land, with a long heritage of close relationships 
-- social, affinal, genetic, and occupational -- between many of 
its residents, with a traditional complex of values that involve 
intimate knowledge of land and place: who owns what bit of 
land, 
what will grow where, who 
is the most knowledgeable about certain 
sites and micro—ecosystems. Therefore, the area could be 
presented and preserved and protected with some of the same 
attitudes as have been taken by the tourist industry toward the 
Pennsylvania Dutch country, replacing -- 
if possible -- the 
various stereotypes of the Piney, and the (I think probably more 
common) ignoring of culture as one of the things to be 
appreciated here by visitors. 
The patterns of recreation traditional 
in the area show some 
of the same major motives and themes that show up 
in 
local 
perceptions of 
it as working land. Patriotism is one: baseball, 
the all—American game, 
is old and pervasive in this area, and it 
is truck farmers and berry growers who have mentioned it most 
often and with the most affection. They sometimes speak of 
themselves as working for their country, 
improving America's 
resources and her standing in the international community by 
increasing her productivity and the security and health of her 
people. Henry Mick worried about national hunger if current 
trends in the usurpation of farmland for other purposes continues 
as he sees them now; Alvin Brick and Brad Thompson repeatedly 
placed their own families' fortunes in the context of national 
food prices and economic patterns. Keeping the Pines a green 
resource for America is certainly not a goal they kick at. Rae 
Gerber, whose family has been 
in truck farming around Tabernacle 
for a long time, even worried that her own desire to see the area 
remain green was selfish. It 
is early 
in the fieldwork process to 
hazard guesses about regional thought, but I'm prepared to say 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 75 
that lack of concern with the national 
interest is not what's at 
the heart of Piney resentment of or noncompliance with 
legislation brought in by the Pinelands Commission since their 
back yards have become part of a national reserve. 
Another common theme 
in the play patterns of the 
agriculturalists I know is that feel for the land as having areas 
of strength and resilience that can be pushed and leant on, 
as 
well 
as fragilities that must be respected if things are not to 
fall apart. Where the water table 
is 
low, people will put in a 
ball field or a house; where there is already a sand mine, people 
will 
ride dirt bikes. But socially and ecologically, they avoid 
damaging the fragile: you knew whose land not to trespass on, 
Denny Doyle pointed out; you knew how many deer you could take 
without depleting the herd, said Kenneth Yates; you knew how to 
harvest birch whips and grapevine so they'd come back thicker the 
next year, said Harvey and Dolores Webb. 
It may give people an 
upsetting sense of conflict to associate "the American people" 
they are feeding with the suburbanites who would like access to 
their agricultural 
land for recreation or building; to associate 
the Commission which is, 
they often feel, taking away their right 
to sovereignty over the land they have bought with their own 
money or inherited from their own families, 
into which their own 
sweat has dripped, 
with the American government whose 
humanitarianism and moral superiority they celebrate in Memorial 
Day parades. 
The people I have talked with seem to realize that these 
dimensions are absent from the land perceptions of recent 
migrants from the cities and of governing bodies for the national 
reserve. They know that commuters do not work with the 
land, do 
not need to understand it for their daily bread, simply because 
their work is elsewhere and of another kind. The Pines are rest 
and recreation space for them, and therefore perceived in those 
terms, without the balancing and enriching perception of them as 
working land. They are aware, too, that new residents often 
appreciate in artifactual form the very lifestyles they displace 
and oppose in performative form: they buy old farm implements as 
antiques, but help to pass township ordinances that make it 
harder to exist as a farmer. 
The old and the new, the us and the them, tend to overlap in 
some lives. When I was out at the Micks' cranberry harvest, two 
of their young hired hands drove up 
in fancy sports cars, and 
after the work was done, changed into white swim trunks and 
sunglasses and went swimming and fishing in the reservoir, 
prompting Francis to comment on the incongruity of their two 
identities: "They don't look 
like bogmen at all 
now, do they?" 
Dave Kalm, family friend and annual harvest helper, 
is an 
insurance agent and a sophisticated photographer as well as a 
bogman and clammer. Here the recreational life, and possessions, 
and garb, are of "them" and the new; working life, the skills of 
cranberry harvesting, the black rubber waders worn, the lunches 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 76 
brought and shared, were of "us" and the old. I think that people 
who have moved to the Pines within the 
last ten years or so 
in 
that great exponential population explosion in the region due to 
urban flight, are perceived largely 
in terms that bind recreation 
and newness and them—ness together, because "we" see "them" 
relating to the place we share, our home turf, largely 
in 
recreational contexts. "We" are out checking our bogs, and "they" 
go by 
in hordes of canoes. "We" are on our way to the feed store, 
and find that "they" have replaced half the old places with 
antique stores and delis -- recreational, nonessential, nonrural, 
nontraditional. In other cases, the relations may well 
be 
reversed: people playing baseball together on an old team may 
well belong to social groups separated in their working lives 
into "us" and "them" as perceived from one or more standpoints. 
It 
is patterns of work and play together that define "us" 
in 
terms of our treatment and understanding of the 
land; work and 
play divorced define "their" lack of understanding, the deepest 
reason for their violations, of the union. 
What of Eileen James, and the communities of people who have 
moved here from the cities since about 1372? What is "us" to 
them? Is the woman who told me that farmers are "anachronistic 
and selfish" for wanting to keep farming representative of a 
widespread view? Is 
it a matter of the esoteric/ exoteric factor 
working its distortions on people's perceptions across the us/ 
them barriers? When the Pines are perceived as a haven in which 
to raise one's children, far from the madding crowd in which one 
works, 
is there a sense of organic unity 
in the relations 
practiced between nature and culture, or are idealized 
perceptions out of step with reality? Do people expect the Park 
Service and mother Nature to preserve and protect while leaving 
them 
free to abuse and destroy? Who ARE those people strewing 
beer bottles along the Wading River, slashing tractor tires, 
demanding that Stephen Lee prove the land is his upon which they 
are 
littering, 
rather than saying they are sorry and picking up 
their litter? What do new Evesham and Shamong residents think of 
their farming and berry growing neighbors? 
Why are there only 
three or four people at your average town meeting in Shamong? 
What are the new residents pushing for where they do turn up 
in 
great numbers at town meetings in Medford and Evesham? If the 
farmers are not there (as they are said not to be), 
is 
it for 
reasons like those voiced by Kenneth Yates and Denny Doyle: that 
their words have been ignored by the officials and distorted by 
the media in the past, and they are sick and tired of the losing 
battle for a voice 
in the future of their region? Is 
it apathy? 
Is 
it helplessness? Is 
it that they'd rather play baseball or 
fertilize their fields while the planning committee is meeting? 
Do 
ideals and reality conflict in 
►ocal agriculturalists' 
reactions to governmental management of their region -- do they 
want to be patriotic, but deeply resent the "national 
interest" 
taking precedence over their regional and familial and personal 
priorities for their land? Do people show consistency or conflict 
in 
the way they handle and perceive the ecology when they are 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 77 
dirt biking or growing blueberries, building ballparks for free 
or developments for $180,000 a lot? Is there an attitude of "My 
little development won't make a difference" that fails to see the 
larger results and implications of their personal choices? Or is 
it truer to say that people have a more intimate and detailed 
knowledge of the land and 
its capabilities than does the 
Commission, upon which they are basing alternative plans for its 
protection and its development? Is 
it the same place whether one 
is working or playing, or do people code—switch in 
interpreting 
the landscape depending on the context and activity? Obviously, 
context and activity make an important difference across groups, 
as they affect the major modes in which people relate to place. 
But what about within individuals? I have seen some code— 
switching, especially in the Yateses' juxtaposition of historical 
society pulls toward the past and developmental pulls toward the 
future; fighting in their working lives for what they bewail 
in 
their recreational 
lives. 
Is 
it common? Does it affect us/ them 
perceptions between those who were born here and those who were 
not; those who work the 
land somehow and those who commute to 
office jobs? Is 
it more a matter of 
individual temperament than 
of social class or occupational role? Hell, I don't know. I'll 
try to light a few candles on this vast dark territory in the two 
weeks remaining.

PFP83—FCC1103 
Yesterday afternoon was the final result of a three—stage 
process 
in getting to know Dennis G. Doyle, manager of Tru—Blu— 
Berries Cooperative Association G—New Lisbon; 21GT (see FNOTES 
CC1019, 0927). I first met him when Brad Thompson took me by the 
cooperative office on our tour of the area, and Denny talked to 
me for about fifteen minutes about farming in the area, and some 
of the legal 
and social changes that have affected it 
in recent 
years. The second time was on my 
initial effort to do a formal 
interview with him: I had called and asked for an 
interview, and 
he offered me lunch and THEN an interview, wanting to have an 
opportunity to assess the project before involving himself with 
it. 
His first concern was with the readership: who was going to 
see what I wrote? What was the real purpose of the project? Were 
we associated with the Pinelands Commission, and 
if so how? 
Rightly or wrongly, I took the line of 
least resistance with 
Denny, and, as he 
is a natural 
leader, I let him lead. 
He drove 
to the restaurant, chose the table, ordered the food, paid the 
bill, and guided most of the conversation. I was almost 
intimidated by him (as I in fact told him), because he 
is one of 
the strongest personalities I have ever met, with keen gray eyes 
and the look of a high—level executive about him. Denny 
is a 
farmer and a woodsman and a gentleman, a clear thinker with civic 
concerns and valuable insights into the region's social and 
natural systems; he 
is also a company manager who can and does 
battle it out with farmers dissatisfied with the price paid by 
the cooperative for their berries, without backing down and 
without losing his temper. He sees his role as manager of the 
cooperative as a kind of civil servant's position: someone whose 
responsibility it 
is 
to help and protect the farmers who belong 
to Tru—Blu, getting information for them on pests and herbicides 
and fertilizers and machinery, finding good markets for the 
berries, promoting their sale, and making sure that the farmers 
get paid right away for their fruit, so that they can pay their 
hired hands and keep their farms going, even 
if the Cooperative 
has not been paid yet by the buyer. This attitude toward his job 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 79 
is 
rooted, I think, 
in the attitudes of the region that produce 
volunteer fire companies and emergency squads; the knowledge that 
one 
is part of a family, part of a community, 
in which 
help and individual responsibility for the common good 
often a matter of course.

The Coop is just off the New Lisbon road, four miles north 
of Four Mile Circle, surrounded by oaks and scrub trees. The 
houses of New Lisbon begin across the street from it, where a 
road goes west toward Pemberton. The oaks overshadow it; brown 
leaves were brushing the roof of the warehouse and office as I 
drove up. I had brought a six—pack of beer and some pretzels with 
me as a gift, and I lugged them, the reel—to—reel tape recorder, 
the enormous green bag full of tape and microphones and power 
cords and mike stands, my shoulderbag, a notebook with my 
interview schedule, and -- figuratively -- the kitchen sink 
in 
with me as I came through the door of Tru—Blu. 
Fieldwork. 
"My God, what's all that equipment?" asked Joe, the 
assistant manager." "What have you got there, Michelo 
been 
in the Pine Barrens too long!" he joked to Denny 
sitting at a long pine desk, with ledgers, charts, an 
spread out before him; Denny was at his desk 
in the c 
windows. The secretary had left for lunch as I drove 
because it 
is 
the off season, the cooperative was emp 
for Joe and Denny. (In season, 
it 
is pandemonium: tru

people shouting,

is helping wi 
recording of each grower's contribution to the Tru—BI 
crop; stockboys are hired and work 
is crazy for every 
it 
is peaceful, and Denny's feet are up on the desk as he works 
on some papers, the phone cradled against one shoulder. We are 
friends now, after an initial meeting, 
lunch, and a letter from 
me, and a couple of phone calls; they know that I am listening to 
what they want to say about the region and 
its land management, 
and that I care about them and can be trusted not to take 
advantage of their trust. The smiles and the joking are warm as I 
come 
in, 
casually putting the Michelob with their coffee supplies 
and chatting about the plethora of ethnographic equipment.

which we occupied, and I set up the microphones while Denny 
talked about the steps he thinks the Commission should take to 
fulfill 
its original goals. 
Architecture, interiors, history. 
Primarily, he said, the main need was for the Commission to 
change its attitude toward local people: for a restoration of 
trust in the goodwill and good sense of the community, and a 
renewal 
of commitment to working with people to attain the goals 
they share: to keep development down and big developers out; to 
protect the way of 
life and the communities that are here 
in 
their integrity; to keep the region's ecology and character 
intact. This, Denny 
is pretty sure, 
is a widely shared priority, 
but the Commission has left that original goal far behind, and 
is 
more involved 
in harrassment of homeowners than 
in protecting the 
region. 
Conservation, government. 
We began with land politics, because it was the issue most 
pressing upon Denny in the context of the interview situation, 
and continued our talk while I set up the equipment. I asked him 
whether he thought I should recommend to the Commission that they 
institute an elected board of 
local people, say one from each 
township, to review and site visit development and building 
proposals; he thought this was already being done by the township 
planning boards. But he 
liked the idea of an appeals court for 
Pinelands Commission decisions on these matters. There is already 
a zoning appeals board, and he has told people angry about PC 
decisions to go take their case to 
it, 
but he thought maybe such 
a local board might be a better recourse. 
I waited to turn the tape on until I had explained what I 
wanted to do, hitting the 
high points of 
the list of questions 
I had brought with me: childhood in his family; roles in the 
family; recreation; what makes a good blueberry grower; what some 
of the new skills and coping abilities needed 
in blueberrying are 
since things have changed so much in the Pinelands; what is 
different about the way kids are raised today 
in growers' 
families from the way he himself was raised, now that farmland 
prices have become prohibitively high, suburbs or recreational 
land are all 
around, and the value of their family land has 
dropped to nothing. He began, on tape, with home life 
in his 
childhood. He was raised right around here, on a blueberry farm, 
and most of the family, especially the men, began working very 
young. He 
is the eldest son: his elder sister carried most of the 
burden of the household chores, and he carried most of the 
farmwork, along with their mother and father. There are six kids 
in 
the family altogether. 
Denny skated quickly over life 
in his family during his 
childhood, and focused upon his life with other kids 
in the area 
(his home community remains unnamed by request). The first thing 
he noted about childhood was an absence of the awareness of 
boundaries: kids roamed freely. There were about six boys and 
five girls his age 
in the area, and the swimming hole at the 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 81 
creek, and the woods, were their hot spots: the equivalent, he 
said, of the movie theatre for city kids. Their interests were 
there: summer, swimming; fall, hunting; winter, 
ice skating; 
spring, when they got to be twelve or thirteen, motorcycles. 
Recreation. 
Both of us grinned over this part. Denny had mentioned to me 
before that he had loved riding motorcycles when he was younger, 
and I was prepared for vivid memories with a lot of good feeling 
-- perhaps related to his reasons for joining the Air Force 
later, since cycling and piloting a small plane have a good bit 
in common experientially. I'd asked about canoeing, baseball, 
dirt biking, when I gave him a general synopsis of what I wanted 
to 
learn about, but this was the one he picked up on first and 
most vividly: 
We started very young. Of course, through the absolute problem of 
mothers, and us riding 
motorcycles up and down hills and coming 
home with our bumps and bruises, ah, some fathers not liking it 
at all, other fathers saying, "You'll 
learn your own lessons; 
take it." We made out very well that way: none of us really got 
hurt seriously. From there it went to, we raced, you know, 
in 
sanctioned races. That was really, probably, the most exciting 
thing that most of the boys did. 
Hunting was a major tradition and still 
is; Denny has eight or 
ten hounds, and his father and grandfather and great grandfather 
did too. From this, and from his extensive camping trips with 
other kids, he has an impressive knowledge of the woods. He 
described for me the proper techniques for starting and putting 
out campfires, and how to get unlost G—Pemberton Township; 21; 
Woodland Township; 26GT once you're lost 
in the woods, described 
in detail on the RLOGS, 024-026. He also, of course, knows 
blueberries: the species, the grades, the fertilizers, the 
growers and their lands and families, the market, the pests and 
diseases, and the processing once they are picked and prepared 
for retail sale. More than anything, Denny knows himself and he 
knows people. 
Dogs, (animal), cognitive maps. 
When we were about half an hour into the interview, we heard 
an elderly male voice calling Denny from the wide open doors of 
the warehouse, and a grower came 
in 
looking for a piece of 
equipment to repair something. Denny greeted him, and I said 
hello: there was no chance for introductions, for, 
in spite of 
the microphone stand and tape recorder set up on the desk, he 
made no comment and asked no questions. He and Denny were deep 
in 
conversation about what he needed in a moment, and Denny walked 
out with him to find 
it for him. While I waited, I looked around 
the warehouse. Beside me on the wall was a poster, fairly new, 
laid over an older and more yellowed version of the same words in 
a different typeface, explaining the gradation standards of Tru— 
Blu Berries. They have four grades of berries, differentiated by 
the number of berries it takes to fill a measuring cup, and by 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 82 
their perfection of form: the bloom must not be off the skin; 
there must be no "rain breaks" or fissures due to water 
absorption in the skin. The berries are packed in pint 
containers, and 
it 
is specified on the poster that the cellophane 
must be squarely placed, and the rubber band put on straight; the 
berries must be mounded up 
in the middle of the box and the 
corners be full; and the berries used to "top off" a container 
must under no circumstances be better or bigger than the berries 
underneath. Tru—Blu will serve as distributor/ broker for star 
grade berries, which are the smallest and those whose bloom has 
been rubbed off or that have fissures in them, but the name Tru— 
Blu cannot be stamped on the containers. 
Technology, aesthetics. 
This kind of detailed quality control 
is one side of the 
Tru—Blu operation's general ethos; the other side 
is the terrific 
caring that Denny gives the growers as a community, and the 
democracy with which 
it makes its corporate decisions. Every 
grower has one vote, whether he has four acres of berries or 
eighty, and, as Brad Thompson, son of a family that belongs to 
Tru—Blu, said, "it's a beautiful way to 
live." There 
is a bit of 
jealousy, or envy, of the cranberry growers' good fortune in 
having Ocean Spray as their buyer; the blueberry industry 
is not 
as strong or as assured of a market, and Denny has to do a lot of 
searching for buyers, and bargaining over prices and when payment 
will 
be made. Some years, 
like this one, there are more berries 
than can be sold. They are working now on increasing promotion 
for frozen blueberries, through the American Blueberry Growers' 
Association. Denny knows the cranberry growers, both regionally 
and organizationally: when I mentioned during our lunch a couple 
of weeks before that Newfoundland had a lot of wild berries, he 
knew the approximate production figures for the island's wild and 
cultivated crops of both species off the top of his head, from 
attention to meetings and national and international figures. 
Marketing. 
We talked woodsmanship and farming during most of this 
interview, as we had talked politics over lunch. When we had 
spent about two hours, Denny 
took me round the Cooperative, 
taking the tape recorder from me and slinging it over his 
shoulder when he saw that I was in pain from carrying it. We 
walked out through the front doors of the shed and around the 
northeast side of the warehouse, on the raised concrete platform 
on which it rests -- built the right height for sliding packing 
crates off truck beds and onto the concrete, as 
is the case at 
the Micks' packing house (see FNOTES CC0330). Along the wall, 
sheltered from the rain, are cedar and plastic frames for holding 
flats of pint containers full 
of blueberries. They are about six 
inches deep and about two feet square, the length and width of a 
packing crate, and they are "airstacked" for shipment: a special 
method which allows air to circulate all 
around the berries and 
keep them fresh. 
(See RLOG for details of use.) At the back 
corner of the building is the scale, where the berries are loaded 
into the plastic flats or pallets for weighing (which eliminates 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 83 
differences in the weight of various wooden flats). It 
is hooked 
up to a computer housed in a well—locked wooden shed beside it. 
The cooler room is directly beside the scale, with a door opening 
onto that part of the loading dock, so that 
berries can be moved 
smoothly from truck to cooler 
in harvest time. 
In the front room 
of the warehouse are stacks of flat, do—it—yourself cardboard 
flats, of a somewhat different design than the plastic and wooden 
ones: they have lips that extend about two inches over the top of 
each side, protecting the berries against bruising in this way 
rather than with crossboards on top, and are only about a foot 
square. Growers come to Tru—Blu to get their flats as well as to 
drop off their berries, pick up their money, pass on tips about 
equipment and processes that work well, and to get advice about 
such things. 
Architecture, technology, marketing. 
At four—thirty, Joe came 
in 
to tell Denny that he was ready 
to 
lock up and go home. I was packing up equipment as we chatted 
by then, and Joe stayed with us as we walked out to my car, 
parked on the hard packed sand 
in front of the coop office. I 
asked them if I could take a couple of pictures of them to go 
with the interview tapes. They were camera—shy, as I am myself, 
but smilingly agreed to 
let me do 
it. We settled on a spot under 
an oak tree in back of the office where the light was nice, 
because the fluorescent bulbs and green walls in the office would 
make unsightly photographs, and the warehouse was too dark. Denny 
had relaxed a good deal by now, and was less the hard—line 
executive than the woodsman, farmer, at the end of a workday and 
among friends; he slipped the gold wire rims off his nose for the 
photograph, so our image of him does not catch the look he brings 
to business dealings. Joe, also relaxed in his billed cap, a 
little younger and more open of face than Denny, kidded him as he 
patiently bore with me, telling him that I was really going to 
put this head and shoulders portrait on a centerfold in Playgirl 
-- a joking metaphor for the real fear of being photographed by 
somebody from the 
federal government, I think, but I just joked 
back, telling him to give me a break and that I was going to get 
him next, which, of course, I did. 
We parted quickly, with the 
understanding that they will get a copy of my final report. That 
kind of accountability is almost conditional to the interview 
having taken place at all. 
Denny, like Francis Mick, 
is one of those people who 
has made quite an 
impression on me, and to whom I feel a sense of 
accountability, because he has talked with me of things that are 
crucial to his own life. He has trusted me; 
he has taught me 
about his region and shared his lifeblood with us, 
all 
of us 
my associates, the readers of our final reports, the Center, 
even, 
in a sense, the public. For his sake, for Francis and Henry 
and Haines Mick; for Mrs. X of the Pinelands Garden Club and the 
Medford Historical Society; for Stuart Brooks, the Evesham 
planner; for Lou and Nellie Stackhouse in New Gretna; for the 
Webbs; for Deacon Jim Bigham and Pastor John Becker of Landmark 
Baptist Church; for the little lady from Leisuretowne that I met 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 84 
today; for the cable TV repairman who accepted a ride from me 
when the rear wheels fell off his truck at the Red Lion Circle; 
whatever the consequences of our study may be will 
be personal: 
in effect and 
in cause. They will perceive me as the agent, of 
good or of evil 
or of no change, where they hoped for it or 
feared it, 
if 
response or consequence comes about from the 
project that affects their lives. I am glad that Denny insists 
upon seeing the final report; all 
the most insightful people I 
have spoken with have taken time and care to decide whether or 
not they want to be associated with the project, and 
it seems to 
go with an awareness of the possible consequences that publicity 
and governmental action -- even ethnographic writing -- can have, 
and often have had for others here and elsewhere. I think half of 
Chatsworth would run John McPhee out of town 
if they had known 
then what they know now about the consequences of his book for 
their community: tourists, reporters, and exoteric views of 
themselves which were insulting as well 
as distorted. As I think 
now about the writing of the final project report, I have that 
accountability in mind. They do not ask partisanship of me, but 
they do ask the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth 
. . . a clarity and completeness of vision beyond my scope: 
perhaps beyond the scope of any human being

21GT, G-Medford; 18GT, FOODWAYS G-Medford; 18GT; 
The Pinelands Garden Club G-Medford; 18GT held a special 
meeting of some ten or twelve members today at the home of Mrs. 
X, 
so that Elaine Thatcher and I could interview the members 
about gardens and yard art. I had set this up by phone with Mrs 
X a couple of weeks before, having met her and asked about 
gardens and garden clubs when I went to photograph Kirby's Mill, 
and she had done all 
the calling and organizing for us, as well 
as hosting the meeting. She phoned a couple of days ahead to ask 
if we could bring some slides to show, and found a friend who had 
a projector and screen 
that she could bring for us to use, so we 
came prepared to gladly learn and gladly teach: 
in about half an 
hour's worth of brainstorming the evening before, we had put 
together two lists of questions, a pad of drawing paper and a 
stack of pencils so they could draw their yards for us, and 
Elaine had assembled a short slide talk on yardscapes in the 
Pinelands. We knew we were welcome; reciprocity was built into 
the interview itself; and we knew the people coming were there by 
choice, doing something not unlike what they normally did 
together. 
Fieldwork. 
We drove over Highway 70 and down Main Street in Medford, 
out through several winding roads, through brown oak leaves 
flying in the wind and circling over our heads. It was cloudy and 
cold, the first classic November day we have had. When we drove 
up the lane that winds through oak and pine to the house, Mrs. X 
came out the kitchen door and called to us to park around the 
back of the barn. "Oh, you're not garden club girls!" she 
exclaimed when I rolled down the window. She came down to the 
driveway then, and directed us with extra warmth and courtesy. 
The house seemed large but unimposing on the outside, 
like 
Mrs. X herself: no fuss and feathers, but definitely upper middle 
class. She 
is a South Georgia woman (at least most recently, 
though her voice sounds Yankee or midwestern to me), 
in her 
fifties, with gray-blonde hair cut bluntly above her shoulders, 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 86 
and no makeup on her strong, fine—boned face. She introduced us 
to the first few women to arrive, reassuring us not to worry 
about Henry, the enormous St. Bernard lying by the kitchen door. 
We came into a house smelling warm and fresh with woodsmoke and 
just—baked cookies, which were lined up 
in neat rows on a big 
tray on the small kitchen table. Iron pots and kerosene lamps, 
baskets, and all sorts of antique kitchen things hung from hooks 
above the cabinets and on the walls all 
around; there were old 
rag rugs on the floor, the same soft gray—blue. The dining room 
was resplendent with a china tea set sparkling under a big 
crystal chandelier, and crowded like a museum with Victorian 
dolls 
in children's chairs, a spinning wheel with a basket of 
wool 
and a carder beside it, a huge cabinet with panels of 
pinpricked tin, a sideboard full 
of china, and two or three 
baskets of 
large, painted, white porcelain eggs (or something 
that felt like porcelain; I neglected to ask what they were made 
of). The living room was even more like a Victorian museum: glass 
kerosene lamps and embroidered sofas, marble—topped mahogany side 
tables, a player piano that she and her husband restored and set 
in order themselves; heavy brocade curtains on big bay windows; 
softly chiming clocks; a fire 
in the big brick fireplace. We set 
up our equipment as fast as we could, arranging photographic 
lights 
and microphones, and chatted with the women as they 
arrived. 
(plant), (animal), (foodways), interiors. 
The group consisted all 
of women between thery—five and 
seventy, middle and upper middle class, and all 
but one had 
recently moved from an urban area. There was one (I think her 
name was Lillian ) in her seventies, from Leisuretowne, 
in a 
dress; Elizabeth Woodford, who runs a private wildlife sanctuary 
nearby, 
in 
red slacks and a black sweater, with her white hair 
cut short; Cathy Hoffman, who looked about 35, 
in a brown 
corduroy suit; Jeannette Johnson, another strong personality, in 
a gray—blue woolen dress, her hair up 
in a graceful bun; Cleone, 
in a suit, with a professional haircut and a bright, friendly, 
outgoing style. Some wore lots of makeup; some wore none. Most 
brought some kind of cookies or pastries to add to the 
refreshments Mrs. X had fixed: there was tea at one end of the 
table and coffee at the other; chocolate chip and peanut butter 
cookies, homemade; Danish pastry cut into finger slices; little 
miniature sweet rolls from a bakery, 
in paper cups; and tiny 
sandwiches of potted ham and egg salad on white bread with the 
crusts out off. They set these things on the dining room table as 
they came 
in. 
Clothing. 
We spent perhaps an hour and a half interviewing the group, 
which really consisted of 
listening to and sometimes guiding 
their conversation. Elizabeth Woodford dominated the discussion, 
both by her own choice and by theirs, for they seemed to think 
that we wanted to know about using local plants in yardscapes, 
rather than about what they do with their yards per se, and she 
is considered the expert on the use of native plants. I was 
intrigued by their attitude toward this: the area presents 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 87 
special soil 
and water problems for gardeners, and lots of things 
will not grow. Elizabeth Woodford has taught them, as other 
garden club speakers in the area apparently do as well, to view 
their gardens in terms of the natural constraints, and learn to 
enjoy them rather than fight them. Woodford said, and they all 
agreed, that if you put fertilizers and sweeteners like lime into 
the soil, you'll have a good garden for a while, but you will 
have ruined the balance of the ecosystem and after a while you 
just have a mess: a hodgepodge of factors in your soil conditions 
that make for nothing but trouble, for you as a gardener, and for 
the soil 
itself. 
So they are putting pine needles on their lawns 
instead of grass seed; using native plants 
in their gardens; 
choosing a low—maintenance garden (as Cathy Hoffman called it) 
that lets nature take its course. 
(plant), 
The lady from Leisuretowne has a different set of 
constraints to cope with: all 
residents are expected to have a 
lawn and keep it 
in good condition. The yards are small, and few 
people put statues of deer or stable grooms or rabbits 
in them: 
personally, she feels it spoils them, because they are too small 
to carry such statuary with a good effect. There 
is also little 
topiary: fences are forbidden in the community, and high shrubs 
are not used as a boundary either. All 
the houses are one story 
("which is nice for the elderly," she pointed out), and of about 
the same type: a small, square bungalow. The sidewalks are 
planted with small trees, and the yards fit the image of the 
community as a whole: safe, small, bland, very conformist. 
I saw Leisuretowne briefly about a month ago, when I drove a 
repairman in whose crew had been working there when his truck 
lost its back wheels on the highway. Its "front door" 
is a 
guarded driveway that leads 
in between tall trees off the north 
side of Route 70, between Four Mile and Red Lion, at Huntingdon 
Drive. There 
is a traffic light and a rather sophisticated 
entrance—exit system from the highway, though 70 
is only a two— 
lane blacktop and not a freeway. It looks wealthy and exclusive 
on the outside, with its 
little cedar guardhouse and 
its 
uniformed guard, and the first few feet look pretty wealthy after 
that, where the tall trees continue and green grass rolls, but as 
one gets back into the residential streets, 
it becomes more 
modest: small homes, many with aluminum siding and prefabricated 
windows; small 
lawns without much differentiation between them. 
It looks like a community in which the homes were all 
built by 
one contractor, at one time, and of course that is exactly what 
it 
is. I was not surprised to hear about the lawn rule, though 
if 
it 
is true that nitrogen fertilizers are illegal here, the rule— 
makers have caused an awful 
lot of 
lawbreaking. Lillian added 
that pets are discouraged, though not forbidden, and they have to 
be 
leashed, and 
if 
you walk them you must clean up their 
excrement. She likes the safety of the community: no fear, she 
said happily, of being mugged 
if you want to walk 
in the park. 
She likes the activities: there's plenty to do and people to do 
it with, 
including a nature club G—Leisuretowne; 21GT that takes 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 88 
trips to sod farms G—Leisuretowne; 21GT and the woods, and has 
speakers come 
in monthly to talk about birds or animals or plants 
or something. 
Voluntary organizations, architecture. 
The ladies ("the girls," as they call each other) stood 
around chatting brightly over their tea and pastries for a half 
hour or so when Elaine wrapped up her group interview, and Mrs. X 
turned on 
lights in the back bedrooms so that her friends and I 
could see the antiques. I had been moving photographic lights 
around and taking pictures of the kitchen and dining room as they 
had talked, and would have photographed the small bedrooms with 
their high beds and crocheted spreads, the trundle bed, and the 
refinished antique chests of drawers, but there were too many 
ladies chatting and looking and balancing china cups on china 
plates, so I just chatted and ate until we were ready to show 
slides. They enjoyed seeing the slides, and came up with some 
interesting insights and reactions, so we turned the tape on to 
catch it all. Cleone suggested that they'd like a picture of us 
interviewing Elizabeth Woodford, but it wound up just a posed 
group photo by the fireplace. (I found it interesting that they 
wanted a photo of us interviewing HER, specifically: she 
is the 
"that's the person you really ought to talk to" person for this 
group. I leave the bulk of discussion on this and other issues of 
the interview to Elaine's notes and the tape logs. 
Interiors. 
TX02: 
COMPARISON OF STYLES OF HOSPITALITY EXPERIENCED IN 
FIELDWORK ACROSS CORE REGION OF PINELANDS 
This interview got me thinking about styles of hospitality 
as I have encountered them around the core region, 
in Tabernacle, 
Vincentown, New Lisbon, Chatsworth, and Medford, where most of my 
work has been. At Flora Thompson's in G—Vincentown; 23GT and Rae 
Gerber's in G—Tabernacle; 25GT, both farm families with blueberries 
and field crops, I have been offered lunch, which was fixed 
casually, by setting out small plates of sliced cheese, ham or 
cold meat loaf, 
lettuce, tomatoes, dark bread, mayonnaise and 
margarine, 
and maybe a bowl 
of home—canned fruit, with hot or 
iced tea, and everyone makes his own sandwich whenever he decides 
to start: no saying grace; no waiting for everyone to sit down. 
In both homes, too, the woman waits on the men and on me as a 
guest: things are set out by the woman, and plates refilled and 
taken to the sink. A glass of water might be offered with hot 
tea, but no other options crowd the guest. When Mr. Gerber wanted 
more tea, he asked his wife 
in his dry, joking manner: "Are you 
going to get me more tea, or shall I take yours?" 
Homemade pie 
or cake 
is hoped for and, often, gotten. 
I don't think there's 
much nibbling between meals. Rae asked me to stay for lunch 
in an 
easy, spur—of—the—moment manner, because we hadn't finished our 
interview and her husband was hungry and asking for lunch; Mrs. 
Thompson was expecting me when Brad, her grandson, brought me by 
on the tour we took through the area, and she went ahead and ate 
before we arrived because she got hungry. The style of 
lunch has 
been casual, relaxed and lingering but not, by any stretch of the 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 89 
imagination, a major or formal meal. 
(foodways) 
Sunday dinner at the Webbs' home 
in G—Chatsworth; 27GT, 
however, was a major if not a formal affair: a full Southern 
chicken dinner, with rice boiled with chicken scraps, sweet corn, 
cornbread, greens, sliced tomatoes, mashed potatoes and gravy, 
fried chicken, and an iced yellow cake and iced, sweet tea, all 
spread out on a sheet—covered board on sawhorses in the sunny 
garden after church. A whole clan was there for that: brothers, 
sisters, grandchildren, in—laws. Yet the casual, serve—yourself, 
come when you're hungry and leave when you're satisfied code of 
table manners held as was the case at the Gerbers' and the 
Thompsons'. The tea and pastries of the garden club meeting 
G—Medford; 18GT was, 
in fact, the only experience I have had 
in the 
Pines of unnecessary eating. The Yateses got me a cup of tea 
after our three—hour interview, but had none themselves; the 
Tomlinsons did not think of tea or snacks when I interviewed 
them. This may well have to do with the fact that I have been 
working a lot with farming families and people of farm 
backgrounds like the Tomlinsons, and over and over again people 
have commented on the importance of not wasting things, of using 
everything. It 
is a strong point of differentiation for several I 
have interviewed, between old timers and newcomers: city people 
are perceived as wasteful, littering, unaware of the work that 
goes into farming and accustomed to an abundance of material 
conveniences. Snacking may be rather alien to farm life, though I 
know too few families to say for sure. The garden club, though it 
may have been purely for the special occasion, was quite a 
contrast: 
little dishes of after dinner mints were all 
around the 
living room, and it was only eleven or so when all those cookies 
and pastries and sandwiches were set out: fun food, not meal 
food. After Newfoundland's obligatory teas at all 
interviews, 
with cake and biscuits and Cheez Whiz and jam and canned milk and 
margarine and homemade bread, I was not prepared to associate 
overconsumption with city folk and higher incomes.

TX03: 
FOLK MEDICINE, NUTRITION, AND HEALTH G—Tabernacle; 25GT. 
HEALTH: The farm people I have worked with have had a 
certain healthy look to their skin and hair that speaks of good 
nutrition as well as fresh air and exercise, noticeably different 
from the tone of skin and hair among the commuting families and 
those recently moved from the cities, but the farm people have 
been 
in more physical pain. Denny Doyle and Henry Mick have 
painfully bad backs; Rae Gerber has a cataract; Mr. Gerber has 
heart trouble and emphysema (though he 
is eighty—five and 
it 
is 
hardly surprising that he should have some health problems). One 
of their sons has chronic kidney stones. Eyeglasses are pretty 
common. Teeth seem healthy, though, and Mr. Gerber, frail and 
bent and unsteady on his feet though he 
is now, has never broken 
any bones in his frequent falls on the concrete floor of their 
packing house. There 
is certainly enough calcium in their diet. 
Cartwright--83 Fieldnotes 
page 90 
FOLK MEDICINE:G—Tabernacle; 25GT 
Rae mentioned today that 
eating wild greens G—FOODWAYS; Tabernacle; 25GT is still common 
in 
her family and has been for generations. An Italian woman in 
Hammonton mentioned that she knew someone who always took 
dandelion wine as a spring tonic G—Hammonton; 11GT, and the spring 
greens probably have something of the same sociomedical status 
(certainly they do 
in Newfoundland). 
Rae's family gathers 
pigweed, dandelion, young pokeweed shoots, and other plants 
listed in RLOG CC030 or 031 for this purpose. She also uses aloe 
vera as a remedy for burns, cuts, and scrapes, and keeps several 
plants growing in pots 
in the pantry. 
While I was there today, Mr. Gerber came 
in rather shaken up 
from his work out 
in the packing shed, saying that he had fallen. 
He had hit his knee and the bridge of his nose on the concrete 
floor, and both were bleeding a little. Rae told him to sit down 
in his special armchair by the window, and fetched a clean cloth 
and a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the kitchen. She cleaned his 
wounds with the alcohol, and 
in a few minutes rubbed them with a 
broken leaf of the aloe, commenting that it helps cuts and 
scrapes to hurry up and heal. (She also mentioned that her 
daughter, who gets a lot of cold sores, used up almost all 
her 
aloe plants and finally bought a bottle of aloe juice at the 
drugstore, so 
it 
is 
locally available and commercially recognized 
as a home remedy. It's common 
in Oregon's counterculture as a 
burn remedy, and 
in some forms of naturopathic medicine in Texas 
as a laxative and internal purifier, but I've never heard of 
it 
being used on cuts before.) 
She spoke casually with her husband about the fall, and 
both seemed to make light of 
it; 
he was out working again in a 
minute, though she wanted him to sit still for a while, and he 
did say he was still shaking, though whether from the cold or 
from nerves, he wasn't sure. Work takes priority over comfort 
and, 
to some extent, over health: 
it 
is necessary to self 
respect, intrinsic to self—concept and to one's feeling of having 
a legitimate role 
in the farming family. 
Doctoring people is women's work, I think, while doctoring 
farm animals seems to be men's: Alvin Brick remembered he and his 
dad doing surgery on their dairy cows out in the barn [VETERINARY 
MEDICINE] G—Tabernacle; 25GT, G—Medford; 18GT. I am not sure where 
pets fall 
in this division of 
labor, but I expect that if they 
are house pets they are women's responsibility and, 
if working 
animals like foxhounds, men's. Mr. Henry, who raises dwarf 
rabbits 
in Presidential Lakes, doctors his rabbits himself. The 
administration of food and medicine seem to go together: the 
household cook 
is also the household first aider. Perhaps on one 
of the spring case studies, more might be learned about the role 
of the volunteer emergency squads in traditional health care 
systems.
