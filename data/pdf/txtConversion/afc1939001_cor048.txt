[Letter from John A. Lomax to Harold Spivacke]
Livingston, Ala. 5/26/1939.
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
1. I am writing today asking the Washington Express office to release the records. It must
have looked to you like an attempted hold-up.
2. My blank records are here waiting for me having been forwarded from Merrivale, La. My
brain got skittery from too much fast travelling and I had to get a check-up from you. My
apologies to you for both slips.

3. From Drew, Miss., on yesterday, I Expresed you a second batch of records. Please find
enclosed receipt.
We are finding some new stuff and re-recording some of the last of the old. The gang work
songs, sung in wild abandon, seem definitely gone. I can't find 'em anymore after only 2
years. And the old spirituals are following: Chief causes, I think, the radio and education.
Thank you again for your helpful promptness and unfailing kindness.
Always sincerely, John Lomax
