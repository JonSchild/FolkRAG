Dan McCarthy's Advice. 
Is you listen to me I 
will sing you a 
song 
Of something that happened to me, . 
I 
went to the theatre a 
short time ago, 
All the pretty girls for to see. 
Now, the first that came out on the stage, 
Was a 
young girl in her teens, 
And she wore spangled clothes, 
And went around on her toes, 
And she roped me behind the scenes. 
So now, kind friends, take my advice, 
And keep away from the girls in their teens, 
\For you will find them old enough to chew hay, 
When they get you bahind the scenes. 
It's the devil's own place, as you will find, 
But that's as you may think, 
Where the girls will tickle you under the chin, 
And it will cost you a 
dollar for a 
drink, 
Yes, and they use all kinds of circus slang, 
"Stag the terrier with the striped jeans." 
Oh, they roped me in with the rest of the gang, 
When they got me behind the scenes, 
Honest Irish Lad. 
Sung with great success, in all the leading theatres of New York, by 
DAN INIcCAnTilv, the celebrated Irish comedian, vocalist, and dancer. 
Mueic by T. F. KERRIGAN 
the greatest Irish union bag pipe player in 
the World. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FISHER, 21 '
Vesey Street, N. Y. 
My name is Me2\.Tamara, 
And I 
came from County Clare, 
In the darling little Isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, 
And the brooks and rippling rills, 
Are Nature's sweetest music all the day. 
Our little farm was small; it could not support us all. 
So one of us was forced away from home. 
And I 
bade them all good bye, 
With a 
tear drop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
Cnoncs. 
I'm an honest Irish lad, 
And of work I'm not afraid, 
If it's pleasure to you I 
will sing and dance, 
Yes, I'll do anything you say, 
If you will only name the day, 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York, 
I 
tried hard to get work, 
Yes, I 
traveled through the streets from day to day, 
And I 
went from place to place, 
With starvation in my face, 
But I 
know I 
have one kind friend, 
Who a 
helping hand will lend 
To a 
poor boy and help him on at home, 
And I'll bring my mother here, 
And my little sister, dear, 
And never from them more again I'll roam. 
I 
will try and do what's right, 
I 
will work both day and night, 
Yes, I'll try and do the very best I 
can, 
And God will bless the heart 
That will take a 
poor boy's part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man. 
HONEST IRISH LAD. 
(Continued). 
When I 
ask for work they want no help, they say, 
Yet still I 
wandered on, 
In hopes I 
would find one, 
Who would give a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But I 
find it's all the same, 
And I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And I 
often times have wished that I 
was dead. 
( 
Otorus. ) 
(Chorus.) 
Written and composed by Jons M CVEIGH, and sung with immense 
success by DAN McCAnniv, the great Irish vocalist and dancer.

Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place, 
For any poor bard-working boy. 
But it's little better here, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
Cnonus. 
Just because I 
am Irish they would give me no work, 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, in good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Ain t 
it bard now,I ask you,that such things should be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast upon them ? 
In America's troubles in'days long ago, 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a 
hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of re-t 
away up in the skies 
That is ever' pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there, 
(Chorus.) 
Words by THOMAS M AGUIRE, and sung to the air of " Little Robin, Tell 
Bitty I 
am Coming,'with great success, by DAN MCCARTHY. 
Come, gather kinds, and listen, 
And a 
story to you I 
will tell, 
You, no doubt, have heard of Erin's great heroes, 
Who 
in the latest of battles have fell. 
But the greatest of things that have happened, 
And may never happen no more, 
Is the escape of the six Fenian prisoners, 
Away from Australia's shore. 
CHORUS. 
Let us hope then the day is not distant, 
When the Irish shall rise up in bands, 
And sever the bonds that unite them, 
And make of themselves a 
free land. 
When these good men were sentenced in Ireland, 
Their country for trying to save, 
They were sent to the shores of Australia, 
And there made the proud Saxons' slaves, 
And they served out ten years of their life time, 
And they vowed that they would serve no more, 
So they escaped on the good ship Catalpia, 
And sailed for America's shore. 
(Chorus.) 
When the good men escaped to the whaleship, 
The authorities thought them to stay, 
So they sent out their warship Georgetta, 
Before they had time to away. 
" 
Now, we want you to deliver those prisoners, 
Or on you we will fire if you lag." 
And they answered, " If on us you fire, 
You will be insulting our American flag." 
AN END SONG. 
Written, composed, and sung by DAN MCCAUTFEY, with great 
success. 
Oh, sinners, stop your wickedness, 
Come join our band and pray, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
If you don't the Lord will burn you up, 
On our next judgment day, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
Now, hell, you know, is deep, and Hell is wide, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
It aint a 
got no bottom, and it aint a 
got no sides, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I'll be dar, yes, dar, 
Oh, I'll be dar, 
And victory's crown of glory I'll be sure to wear, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
Oh, Henry Ward Beecher is getting cracked, 
in this beautiful world on high. 
He carries Plymouth Church around on his back, 
In this beautiful world on high. 
Yes, and he wears his shirt outside of his coat, 
In this beautiful world on high, 
And he buttons his pants around his throat, 
In this beautiful world on high.

A 
comic Irish refrain, sung, with great success, by DAN McCArrny. 
Oh, from Middletown to Watertown

And from Watertown to Middlotown

Oh, from Middletown to Watertown, 
And from Watertown to Middletown 
Yes, from Middletown to Watertown 
Is fifteen miles.

The Devil's In New Jersey. 
Words by CHARLES BURNS, and sung with great 
success by 
DAN McCaniur. Music by T. F. limutmaN,the Piper. 
As I 
rose up last Sunday, boys, 
I 
was feeling a 
kind of merry, 
Says 
I'll have a 
jolly time, 
So I 
crossed over to Jersey by the ferry, 
But never again will I 
do that same, 
For the consequence was frightning. 
Now, what can you expect of a 
man, 
Filled up with Jersey lightning? 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you may talk of this, and you may talk of that, 
And you may talk of places noisy, 
But, by the—no, 
will not swear, 
But the devil is in New Jersey. 
I 
ran in mud up to my eyes, 
For I 
never yet was lazy, 
When a 
big policeman scooped me in, 
And he swore that : was crazy. 
I 
was surrounded in a 
cell, 
With big mosquittoes flying. 
And when morning came, from the loss of blood, 
Sure I 
thought that I 
was dying. 
(Chorus.) 
Next day I 
went before the Judge, 
And he looked on nv-
.; with pity, 
He says, "Young man, the sentence is, 
One hour to leave the city." 
I 
did net wait tc hear the rest, 
And 
can bet I 
was not noisy, 
For when : stepped in New York I 
cried, 
" 
May the devil shoot New Jersey. 
(Chorus.) 
THE DEVIL'S IN NEW JERSEY, 
(Continued.) 
Now when I 
got home I 
found my wife, 
Along with a 
big club awaiting,. 
She said to lay her hands on me 
That her tender heart was breaking, 
We had it up and down the floor, 
And at last I 
cried for mercy, 
When she cried, " You sucker, go anywhere, 
But, for God's sake keep from Jersey." 
(Chorus.) 
On the 13th of October, In The 
Middle of July. 
A COMIC IRISH REFRAIN. 
Sung with tremendous success, by DAN MCCARTHY. 
Oh, it was on the 13th of October, 
In tho middle of July, 
Oh, the forenoon wasn't wet at all, 
And the afternoon was dry—what do you soy ? 
I 
espied a 
lovely damsel, 
Down under an old oak tree. 
Ah, the devil a 
word I 
said to her, 
And she said the same to me. 
Donovan's Dance. 
Written and sung by DAN McCann:1Y. Music by T. 
F. 
KERRTGAZI. 
I 
was down last night to Donovan's dance, 
Where the boys and girls did sing and prance. 
Such a 
noisy gang I 
never did see, 
And never in my life had I 
such a 
spree, 
Old Donovan himself was managing the floor, 
And old Casey, the piper, was sitting at thc door, 
When Mrs. Moriarty, while a 
pedling out the boor, 
Run against old Casey and knocked him out of the cliii 
CHORUS. 
There was lots of fun for all the boys, 
And lots of rum and lemon pies, 
There was pipes, tobacco, punch and tea, 
And we danced like the devil 
Until the break of day. 
There was One-legged Dougherty a 
sitting on a br,rre, 
With long Gill Riley and cross-eyed Farrell, 
And Miss 01Rooney's sister, Jane 
Was dancing a 
jig with Daniel Kane. 
Then One-legged Dougherty—lie got tight, 
Heaped on the floor and wanted to fight, 
And we fired him out before he had a 
chance, 
Sure we had the devils's own time at Donovan's dance.

lonely stranger, 
All the way from Pennsylvania, 
When I 
work, my life is in danger, 
I'm a 
noble sinecure. 
Iii•Yah. 
I

And in my pockets I

I'm a 
holy terror to this nation, 
Yes, I'm the Pennsylvania tramp, 
CHORUS. 
Measuring is my occupation, 
And hunger give's me many's the cramp, 
Work and me are no relations, 
For I'm the Pennsylvania tramp. 
From New Haven to Wee hawkin, 
That's- the road, boys, don't be talking, 
On my back I've an army wallI!ng, 
Ladies come and pity me—Hi-ITah. 
Barn or wood-shed, that's my bed-room 
When the weather is cold or 
Stealing chickens—that's the rarqiet, 
For I'm the Pennsylvania tramp. 
Oh, Pm a 
man that's never greedy, 
You will never find me seedy, 
I'll rob a 
clothes if I 
am needy, 
I 
am an old professional. 
Hi-Yan. 
I'm on the hunt for money, 
Poverty is my highest lamp, 
And a 
maid with stamps, boys, 
That's the honey for I, 
The Pennslvania tramp.

Words and Ilusio by W. H. Dzi.zueirrs. 
They had been boys together, 
Some fifteen years ago; 
Were fond of one another, 
Good friends, in weal or woe. 
But the iron hand of destiny 
bivided them, and so 
10-day they meet as strangers, 
Dear friends of long ago. 
Dame fortune met the lucky one— 
Smiled on him—gave her store; 
But shunned the bold and plucky ono, 
Who sailed the ocean o'er; 
The riches that came to him 
Was not his, alas! ah, no 
He risked—lost—and losing, loot 
Dear friends of long ago. 
In the Park of a 
noble City, 
Struts a 
lordly millionaire; 
And his heart is moved to pity 
For another, strolling there. 
It is morning, and the lucky one 
Is out to catch the air, 
While the sad, imporish.)d, plucky one, 
beelis work ,411 uui' tare. 
Good morning, lord and master! 
Said the poor man, bending low, 
I 
am hungry, and would work, sir, 
If I 
had the work to do. 
I 
have worked my passage over 
From cold England's selfish shore, 
And I'm looking for my friends, sir, 
For the f,iends I 
knew before. 
What is your name ? " Tom Roland," Sir. 
" 
Tom Roland, here's my hand, 
And all of John Day's fortune, sir, 
Is now at your command." 
" 
Why bless your heart! you're wealthy, Tom, 
Your Uncle—now laid low— 
Willed all his wealth to you, Tom— 
Dear friend of' long ago." 
" 
You remember Alice Brown, Tom, 
She lives, and loves you still; 
Come, shake hands with her brother, Tom," 
'• Bill Brown—you bet I 
will." 
And I 
was out for an appetite, Tom,

THE FLAG WE LOVE 
THE BEST. 
Sung by EDWIN B
ARRY, at Harrigan ez Hart's Theatre Comique, amid 
roars of applause. 
Strange sayings are the rage, on the street and on the stage, 
And many glorious maxims you will find; 
But there's one more than the rest 
Seems to linger in my breast, And very oft comes stealing 
o'ermy mind; 
I'll sing a 
song to-night of a 
motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, or to anyone that's poor, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Now there's many a 
man, who great riches does command, 
But his praises and his honors they are small ; 
But when he's dead and gone, they will speak of him and 
mourn, 
And say how good that he has been to all. 
And while upon this earth, struggling hard through life, 
No one would assist him in his plans ; 
But the stories they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can. 
The workingman to- day with his poor and scanty pay, 
Striving very hard his family to maintain ; 
'While the rich they stay at home with the riches that they own, 
The poor may ask assistance all in vain. 
When humble is your lot in the wretched laborer's cot, 
Don't pass them by, but take them by the hand, 
Don't turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Written by TOM H ARPER. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 18'15, by A. J 
- 1511RK, in the otlice of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
And sung with great success by lieurEu & bTANILL, 
Air—" Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane. 
WHEN the war it first broke out, Oh den we run away ! 
And joined the ranks of General Sherman true, 
And with the white folks dar we fought and lost our legs 
In protecting the red, the white and blue ; 
But now we have come home find everything has changed, 
Old Massa and old Missus gone to rest; 
But old Massa always tin& us to try and do what's right, 
And protect the flag he loved the best. 
CHORUS. 
But now we have come find everything is changed, 
And we too soon will pass away to rest; 
But we shall never forget our dear old Southern home 
Where we fought for the flag we love the best. 
We ever shall remember what old Master told to us 
Of that noble man whose known both near and far; 
Who fought for liberty and proved himself to be 
A_ hero in peace and in war, 
We mean that noble man brave General Washington, 
Whom all true sons of freedom will ever bless, 
ITe gained our independence and made a 
nation free, 
And this is the flag he loved the best. 
But now ;cre have come home. etc.

RIDING ON THE RAILWAY, 
Written by D. A. KELLY. 
Sung by COLLYER & KELLY. 
While riding on the railway cars the other day, 
A 
very funny incident happened by the way;_ 
A 
woman, with a 
large market basket on her arm, 
Got on at a 
way station, convenient to a 
farm. 
She put the basket under a 
seat, and then she raised her vail, 
And turning to me, asked Is this the Morning Mail? 
I 
told her that it was, and settled for a 
nap, 
When sudderdy in my face I 
felt a 
most tremendous slap. 
CHORUS. 
In the railway to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, which I 
now will show to you. 
I 
turned to the lady, and inquired the cause. 
You dirty loafer! she says to me, Its very well you knows; 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, to treat a 
lady so. 
Says I, Madam, what I'm guilty of Fm sure I 
do not know. 
She sat down in her seat, then rose again in haste, 
And says, Is there a 
gentleman will save me from this baste? 
Or bring me a 
policeman, for sure as eggs is eggs, 
I'll have this brute arrested for tickling of my legs. 
In the railway etc. 
The color rose to my cheeks, I 
swore it wasn't so, 
And asked if anyone would for the Conductor go. 
The Conductor he arrived, asked for an explanation. 
The old lady told her story, without any hesitation. 
The Conductor tried to calm her— she was at fever heat— 
She wouldn't listen to him till he pulled from under the seat 
Her great big market basket, and then, how very shocking I 
Discovered a 
big rooster, who'd been picking at her stocking. 
CIIORUS. 
In the railway, to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, as I 
now have shown to you. 
Murphy's Great Walk. 
Written by JAS. RICHMOND for, and sung by, PAT ROONEY, 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
Arrah, my name is Isaac Murphy, 
And Ph have ye all to know 
That I 
was born in China, 
Near the county of Mayo. 
I 
can walk six months and never stop, 
I 
can run faster than a 
train; 
Faith, I 
am soon going over to England, 
To bring the belt Rowell took back again. 
CHORUS. 
I'll walk the first hundred miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brows, 
And the fourth upon my nose. 
The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I 
am the boss. 
I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a 
half, 
Or around the world in a 
hundred hours— 
When I 
told O'Leary he gave me the laugh. 
I 
can walk for a 
year without any sleep, 
And keep waltzing around on the track; 
It would take me ninety minutes, just, 
To walk from here to Germany and back. 
I'll walk the first hundred, & c.

Oh, how soon we are forgotten 
In this busy world of ours, 
Though we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flowers. 
Ev'ry loving deed and action 
is remembered but a 
while; 
And the thanks are oft as heartless 
As a 
flirting maiden's smile.

Tho' we often strew the pathway 
Of our friends with choicest flow'rs, 
We are very soon forgotten

Though we aid our lame companions, 
Who are plunged in deepest strife. 
Ev'ry tender word that's spoken 
To a

Has a

In this bustling world of care.

Give the workingmen their pay, 
When McGee goes in for Senator, 
On next election day.

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
To learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
CHORUS. 
Swim out says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over-hand says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh I " chaw roast- beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back- dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim ; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorus. 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
I'll ne'er forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

Oh my heart is gone but my gall remains, 
A 
charming girl went through me ; 
She took my cash, for I 
was too fresh, 
And she gave me a 
terrible skin. 
I 
was on the booze, I 
lay down to snooze 
The first time she beheld me, 
And she worked the fake, for the graft was great, 
And I 
seen her in my dreams. 
When she went through me; (Sym.) 
And she knew me! ( Sym.) 
She worked me for my wealth. 
And didn't leave a 
nickel! (Sym.) 
She surprised me ! (Sym.) 
She paralyzed me I (Sym.) 
And she played me for a 
gilly all the while. 
CHORUS. 
That Italian gal, no I 
never shall 
Forget the day she worked me. 
I 
will let her be, for she roasted me— 
I'm just as fresh as she. ( Dance) 
Oh that poison face got me off my base, 
And she played me for a 
gilly; 
And said I 
was no good, and my name was mud, 
Tra-la-lee, George, look for work, 
Then I 
pulled a 
pop and she took a 
drop, 
Then she did not seem so giddy. 
She winked her eye and gave me the guy, 
And she tickled me under the chin. 
She's as handsome 
As a 
handcart ! 
With her head stuck in 
Picking cinders! 
She's a 
daisy ! 
She's terrible lazy ! 
And she played me for 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
an ash barrel— 
(Sym.)

a

GOD BLESS YOU, COLLEEN. 
Words and Music by HARRY KENNEDY. 
Sung by the Favorite Balladist, Miss ALICE D'ERINA. 
The shores of dear Erin recede from my sight, 
As swiftly our bark glides the waters so bright ; 
And eager I 
look, with a 
sorrowful gaze 
Upon the dear land where I've passed all my days. 
My thoughts turn to home, and the dear faces there, 
And for my dear Kathleen I 
breathe a 
fond prayer, 
And say, as the land quickly fades from my view, 
God bless you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true. 
CHORUS. 
God bless you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true, 
True to the heart that beats only for you; 
Think of me, darling, when from you I 
stray, 
God bless you, Colleen, when I'm far away. 
A 
tear dimmed my eyes, as with feeling oppressed, 
I 
stiffied the sob that arose in my breast ; 
And thought of the long days of sorrow and pain, 
Before I 
could see thee, my darling again. 
That night in my dream I 
returned to my home, 
And through the green meadows with Kathleen did roan, 
But making the old words come back anew, 
God bless you, Colleen, I 
know you'll be true. 
God bless you, etc. 
GOOD NEWS FROM HOME.

Good news from home, good news for me, 
Has come across the deep blue sea. 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
And since we parted, long ago, 
My life has been a 
scene of woe ; 
But now a 
joyful hour has come, 
For I 
have heard good news from home. 
Cnonus. 
Good news from home, good news for mo, 
Has come across the deep blue sea, 
From friends that I 
have left in tears, 
From friends that I've not seen for years. 
No Father 's 
near to guide me now, 
No Mother's tear to sooth my brow, 
No Sister's voice falls on mine ear, 
No Brother's smile to give me cheer; 
But though I 
wander far away, 
My heart is full of joy to-day, 
For friends across the Ocean's foam, 
Have sent to me good news from home. 
Good news from home, &c. 
When shall I 
see that cottage door, 
'Where I've spent years of joy before ! 
'Twas then I 
knew no grief or care, 
My heart was happy there ; 
Though I 
may never see it more, 
Or stand upon my native shore ; 
Where'er on earth I'm doomed to roam, 
My heart will be with those at home. 
Good news from home, &c.

I 
took my Nelly for a

And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride, 
Nelly Ray, & c. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy 
shall lie. 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brightest

WHAT legi as f 
friends always bless us, 
When golden success gilds our way, 
How they smile as they softly address us 
So cordial, good lammed and gay. 
But, oh if the sun of prosperity 
has set, then how quickly they frown, 
And cry out in tones of severity, 
Kick the man, don't you see he is down?

So let all your hearts be honest and true, 
And do unto others as you'd have them to do; 
Sickness and sorrow nav fall unto you,

You wander about through the town 
Yoar friend became very near sighted 
And don't seem to see you when down.

Is free from the world's selfish rust,

All hail to the friend whose devotion 
Will lift up a

Written and sung by HARRY CLARKE, Irish and Character Vocalist. 
His name was Jeremiah McCarty, the loafers called him 
Mick, 
In his button hole he carries a 
pop and he wears a 
walking 
stick, 
Ills hair is the color of an onion, his eyes are very weak, 
He's the darling of the ladies and you ought to hear them 
squeak— 
Cnonus. 
Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, oh, there's our darling Mike, 
I'll meet you round the corner when the burns are on the 
strike, 
I'll give you a 
ride in a 
wheelbarrow, I'll take you to a 
party, 
The darling of the ladies is Jeremiah McCarty. 
For a 
necktie he wears his father's suspenders, and he sleeps 
down stairs in the cellar, 
lie 
looks just like a cigar sign with a Chinaman's 
umbrella, 
his boots are made of cowhide, for his drinks he never 
pays, 
He stands upon the corner and this is what he says— 
Cnonus. 
Mary Ann, Mary Ann, wh I 
don't you skip the gutter, 
Take a 
five cent bowl of soup and then you will feel better, 
Take a 
run around the corner, tell Bridget Moriarity, 
That the darling of the ladies is Jeremiah McCarty.

He combs his hair about twice a 
year, he wears a 
horse's 
collar, 
His mother she keeps a 
peanut stand, she is worth about a 
dollar, 
He lives by peddling fish all day, he has a trombone 
voice, 
You ought to hear him sing " My Mary Ann," I'm sure he 
thinks its nice. 
CHORUS. 
But it's bad, it's the worst that ever you heard at all, 
You'd think it was a

But still he says he's the ladies pet, is Jeremiah McCarty

How oft when we hear of misfortune, 
Befalling a 
friend or a 
foe, 
If in joy or regrets we express it, 
That's the way of the world you all know; 
I 
thought I 
would speak of a 
subject, 
Interesting each village and town, 
That is iron-heeled capital striving 
To put the poor workingman down. 
CHORUS. 
Let capital shake hands with labor, 
Let the poor have the bread that they earn, 
For surely they need every penny, 
Is a 
lesson quite easy to learn; 
Remember the poor love their children, 
So give them a 
smile, not a 
frown, 
Live, and let live, be your motto, 
Oh! don't put the poor workingman down. 
That money is the root of all evil, 
-Why all of us likely's found out, 
The richer class think that the poorer, 
Should of pleasure know nothing about; 
The honest poor always will labor, 
They don't ask a 
title or crown, 
Why begrudge them sufficient to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc. 
So now in conclusion I'll mention, 
That life being dear to its all, 
The poorer class must have existence, 
So   
don't push them close to the wall 
Now hope that in future, the richer 
On the poorer will smile and not frown, 
Who ask but enough just to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc

But take the next ship that is coming this way ; 
I'm waiting to welcome and comfort you here, 
And Molly, I

And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
think she's an angel that dropped on the earth, 
With her soft sunny smiles and her sweet laugh of mirth; 
And I've oft thoughts of fear that she'll sometimes be gone, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
I'll meet her next Sunday by fair Avondhu, 
When I'll ask her to love me and marry me, too; 
And rove in the grove till the twilight comes on, 
And that's what I'll say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And that's what I'll say to my own Eileen Bawn.

The shamrock H ome. 
Dedicated to JOHN RAYNOR, the rising Irish Coinique, by BEN Commis, 
Sung by JNO. REILLY. 
In Erin's Isle—the shamrock's home, 
A 
darling fond and true, 
A 
lilly fair, with golden hair, 
And cheeks of the brightest hue. 
I 
soothed her sorrow, bade farewell, 
Munnurred, ' Katie, think of me," 
Grasped her father's hand and left 
To cross the stormy sea. 
Katie, darling, think of me as always by your side, 
And never fear, my colleen dear, 
I'll return for you, my bride. 
Cuoitus. 
Katie, mine, when the winter wind is snarling, 
The love of my colleen will cheer me always. 
Think of our parting sorrow and starting, 
I'll remember you, too, in the long summer days. 
I 
often think of the happy days, 
When Kate and I 
did roam, 
By the old mill that's running still, 
Where the waters dance and foam, 
It was there I 
met her in the evening, 
Throwing pebbles at the tide, 
H 
uneward bound, what happy moments, 
She was by my side , 
I 
am thinking of her all day, 
Long My Cushla Gm Machree, 
And dreaming of her lovely face, 
It fills my heart with glee.

SOMETHING IN THE CITY. 
Sung with great success by WILL H. MORTON, with Harrigan 
and Hart's Combination. 
I 
live up town in Harlem, 
Every morning out I 
crawl, 
Perhaps I 
come to town, 
Perhaps don't come at all. 
My movements are uncertain, 
And curious folks I 
pity, 
For they would like to know quite well, 
What I 
do in the city. 
Spoken—My neighbors can't find out what I 
do for a 
living; 
they have all come to the conclusion, however, that I 
do--
CHORUS. 
Something in the city, 
Something in the city, 
They don't know quite, they think they're right, 
Something in the city. 
(Repeat.) 
Some say that I'm a 
banker, 
Or deal in foreign wares, 
Some say that I'm a 
broker, 
Among the Bulls and Bears. 
Some say that I'm a, lawyer, 
But all the maidens pretty, 
Think that I'm a 
preacher, or do 
Something in the city. 
Something, etc. 
Perhaps I 
meet with Smith, 
We talk about the weather, 
Up comes Brown (you all know Brown), 
We have a 
drink together. 
When I 
am gone, Brown says " who's he?" 
" 
That's Johnson, very witty," 
"What does h do?" " Bless me if I 
know, 
spoken—Oh, yes! he does— 
Something in the city. 
Spoken—It's been remarked in my Deghborhood that I 
was 
in the lottery business, and the young ladies they all say I'm 
on the press. 
But they are all wrong. 
Now I 
tell you confi-
dentially what I 
do for a 
living. 
Every time I 
go down town, 
I 
do—well— 
Something, etA 
RING THE BELL SOFTLY 
SOME one has gone from this strange world of ours, 
No more to gather its thorns with its flowers, 
No more to linger where sunbeams must fade, 
Where, on all beauty, Death's fingers are laid.. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet, 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
CECORUS. 
Weary with mingling life's bitter and sweet, 
Weary with parting and never to meet; 
Some one has gone to the bright golden shore 
Ring the belt softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Some one is resting from sorrow and sin, 
Happy where earth's conflicts enter not in. 
Joyous as birds, when the morning is bright, 
When the sweet sunbeams have brought us their tight. 
Weary with sowing and never to reap, 
Weary with labor and welcoming sleep, 
Some one's departed to Hc:•ven s 
glad shore I 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, ,t.c. 
Angels were anxiously longing to meet 
One who walks with them in Heaven's bright street; 
Loved ones have whispered that some one is blest, 
Free from earth's trials, and taking sweet rest. 
Yes! there is one more in angelic bliss, 
One less to cherish, and one less to kiss, 
One more departed to Heaven's bright shore! 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door: 
Ring the bell softly, there's crape on the door. 
Weary with mingling, &a.

Blow Gently, Winds, Blow Gently. 
As I 
wander through the fields 
Where the sweet flowers are growing, 
Or down in the meadow where the streamlet is flowing. 
I 
sing that my love may come safe back to me. 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, 
While my love is on the sea. 
For, oh! he is coming, coming back to me. 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, 
While my love is on the sea. 
Though the sky is fair and calm 
Above, in sunlight brightly glowing; 
And through the softly waving trees the mildest breeze 
is blowing, 
Far, far, upon the Ocean, ah ! what storms may there 
not be. 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, 
While my love is on the sea ; 
For oh! he is coming, coming back to me. 
Blow gently, winds, blow gently, 
While my love is on the sea.

Bobbing Around.---No. 1. 
In Augmt last, on one fine day, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
When josh and I 
went to make hay, 
We went bobbing around, 
Says Josh to me let's take a 
walk, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Then we can have a 
talk, 
As we go bobbing around. 
We walked along to the mountain ridge, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Till we got near Squire Slipshop's bridge, 
As we went bobbing around. 
Then Josh and I 
went on a 
spree, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
And I 
kiss'd Josh, and Josh kiss'd me, 
As we went bobbing around. 
Then Josh's pluck no longer tarried, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around. 
Says he dear Patience let's get married, 
Then we'll go bobbing around. 
Now I 
knew he lov'd another gal, 
A bobbing around, around, around, 
They call'd her long legg'd crook'd shin, curly 
tooth'd Sal, 
When he went bobbing around. 
So after we got into church, 
A 
bobbing around, aroun-, arouna, 
I 
cut and left Josh in the lurch, 
Then he went Lobbing around. 
So all you chaps what's got a 
gal, 
A 
bobbing around, around, around, 
Do thinic of long legg'd crook'd shin, curly 
tooth'd Sal, 
When you go bobbing around. 
Bobbing Around.---NO. 2. 
Good evening white folks, here I 
am, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
Just listen to this colored man, 
For I've been bobbing around. 
Whenever I 
promenade the street, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
Something new I 
always meet, 
As I 
go bobbing around. 
Our dandies now do dress so strange, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
One would think they were deranged, 
To see them bobbing around. 
You'd laugh to see them walk the street, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
With Shanghai coats down to their feet, 
As they go bobbing around. 
Our ladies too they look so queer, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
With their bonnets behind their ears, 
As they go bobbing around. 
Their long- tail dresses take the lead, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
Sweeping machines we no more need, 
Since they've been bobbing around. 
The Temperance men have passed a 
law, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
But made it worse than it was before, 
For it keeps you bobbing around. 
You must get a 
jug and fill it full, 
Bobbing around, around, around, 
And when you're dry you take a 
pull, 
To keep you bobbing around.

There was McNamara. and Underwood,

They were the four associates of bould Jack Donahue.

Billy's Appeal to His Ma. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Presented YO FIELDS and H ANSON. 
Give my boxing-gloves to brother, mammie, when I'm dead, 
When the sexton puts me under in my little bed; 
If the job is like to throw him when the string he jerks, 
Get some little boy to show him how the old thing works. 
[Repeat last line. 
Mamma, buy me a 
bran new Ulster, hire a 
Pullman car, 
Give me a 
bath of Florida water, I 
see the gates ajar ; 
Give me a 
dose of paregoric—there's nothing about me mean, 
Give the sexton half a 
dollar to see that my grave's kept green. 
[Repeat last line. 
Give my chewing gum to sister, I 
don't want it any more, 
On my lips it raised a 
blister that was awful sore ; 
Sing to me the Last Rose of Summer—mamma, don't you cry, 
For in the clouds I'll raise a 
racket, in the sweet by and by. 
[Repeat last line. 
Sprinkle my body with powdered sugar, smear me over with 
tar, 
Cover my form with peacock's feathers—I 
want to be an 
angel, ma; 
Let me bite the old torn cat's tail off, she can't ketch no mice, 
Let me go bathing with the girls—it's naughty, but it's nice. 
[Repeat last line.

BOY LOST. 
Missing from Philadelphia about the 3rd of next month, 1780, 
a 
tall complexioned young man, about five feet six inches 
of age; height, thirty-seven years; had on when last seen a 
pair of swallow-tailed sealskin trowsers, with sausage stripes; 
fashionable mutton- chop waistcoat, with ca3t iron trimming; 
double barreled frock coat, with tripe collar and tobacco lining; 
watertight canvas boots, with patent leather tops, laced up at 
the sole; is deaf and dumb of one eye, and hard of hearing with 
the other; 
is slightly pockmarked at the back of his head; 
stoops upright when he walks crooked: a 
slight impediment in 
his look, and wears a 
Grecian bend on his upper lip ; 
whiskers 
cut off short inside; was carrying an empty carpet box in each 
hand, and a 
wooden bag in the other, containing screw steam-
ers, railway tunnels and blacking. 
Was born before his young-
er brother, his mother being present on the occasion. 
Any one giving such information as will leave him where he 
is, will be prosecuted as the law directs.

Sweet Voice at the Door. 
Originally sung by SHEPARD A: W HITNEY. 
The summer sun was shining fair 
As I 
tripped o'er the lea, 
A. damsel fair with golden hair 
And eyes too blue to see, 
The birds were singing sweeter 
Than they'd ever sung before, 
And echoing to the warblings of 
That sweet face at the door.

Then I 
felt so happy when I 
saw ( Break.) 
My Nellie sitting at the door, (Break.) 
Oh, music haunts my memory, 
And gently steals me o'er, 
I 
know I 
never shall forget 
That sweet voice at the door. 
Long years have come and gone since then, 
And gently passed me o'er, 
But still my loved one sits and sings 
Her sweet songs at the door. 
But when I 
dream of other days 
I 
love them as before, 
I 
know I 
never shall forget 
That sweet voice at the door.

W e 
Came From Ireland 
WHEN ERIN FIRST ROSE. 
Written by BEN COLLINS for the W HITNEY'S. 
Oh, here we are this evening, 
An Irish pair so true, 
We're just from Tipperary, 
Across the ocean blue. 
We'll sing and dance to please you, 
Our style you see is grand, 
We're as happy as two thrushes, and 
We came from Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
Then watch our easy motion, (Break.) 
We have just come o'er the ocean 
To sweet America, 
We're gay and free as the little birds, 
And we'll have you to understand, 
We are two Irish Paddy's, and 
We came from Ireland. 
We 
left our native country 
While the birds were singing gay, 
To meet you here this evening 
We've braved the stormy sea, 
We left our friends behind us, 
And as we waived our hand, 
We softly murmured to them all, 
We're leaving Ireland. 
(Chorus.) 
By the FIELDINGS. 
WHEN Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood, 
God blessed the green island, and saw it was good: 
The Emerald (
A 
Europe, it sparkled and shone, 
In the ring of the world, the most precious stone. 
In her sun, ln her soil, in her station thrice blest, 
With her back toward Britain, and her lace to the West; 
Erin stands proudly insular, on her steep shore, 
And strikes her high harp, ' mid the ocean's deep roar. 
By the groans that ascend from your forefather's grave, 
For their country thus left to the brute and the slave; 
Drive the demon of bigotry home to his den, 
And where tyrants made brutes, now let Erin make men. 
Let her sons, like the leaves of the shamrock unite, 
A 
partition of sects, from one foot-stalk of right, 
Give each his full share of the earth and the sky, 
Nor fatten the slave where the serpent would die. 
Alas! for poor Erin, that some are still seen, 
Who would dye the grass red, from their hatred to green; 
Yet, oh when we're up, and they're down let them live, 
Then yield them that mercy which they would not give. 
Arm of Erin be strong, but be gentle as brave, 
And uplifted to strike, be still ready to save 
Let no feeling of vengeance prenme to defile, 
The cause of, or man of, the Emerald Isle. 
The cause it is good, and the men they are true, 
And the green shall unite with the Red, White, and Blue. 
And the triumphs of Erin her daughter shall share, 
With the full swelling chest, and the fair flowing hair. 
Their bosoms heave high for the worthy and brave, 
But no cowards shall rest in that full swelling wave; 
Men of Erin awake, and make haste to be blest, 
Rise arch of the Ocean, and que 
of the West. 
Written and sung with marked success by the" Irish Emperors," FAVO. 
and SHIELDS. 
We came from dear old Ireland, 
Where the apple praties grow, 
Way over across the ocean, 
In the County of Sligo. 
We left our wives, God bless them, 
Which made our hearts feel sore, 
But now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home once more. 
CHORUS. 
We're going home, 
We're going home, 
For now we're tired roaming around, 
So we're going home again. 
[Repeat Chorus 
Oh, take us back to Ireland, 
Where we were bred and born, 
Way out among the shamrocks, 
So early in the morn. 
We think we see the dear ones 
Coming down the lane ; 
When we get back to Erin's Isle, 
We'll never roam again. 
We're going home, &c.

Time has quickly taken flight 
In the soft 
When in Heaven with the Angels 
Shall we, clearest, meet again, 
Will we climb the hill together 
To the land that knows no pain? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart,

There we'll meet to never part.

THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE, 
Duet sung with great success by the W HITNEY'S, In their original 
sketch, " Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When I'm far away from thee ? 
Will you still be true my darling, 
When I'm sailing o'er the sea, 
Keep the vows of love we plighted 
When we bade our last farewell, 
That you'll keep me in remembrance, 
Tell me, darling, only tell ? 
CHORUS. 
Whisper softly, sweetly, darling, 
Say I 
will be true to thee, 
Though for years we may be Parted, 
Promise to remember me. 
Tell me love, will you remember 
When the roses cease to bloom? 
And December, bleak and dreary, 
Takes the place of gentle June. 
Though we may be parted, darling, 
By the cruel hand of time, 
Promise that you will be true, love, 
'Till I 
come to call you mine.

There's greatness for us all, 
And say because they're doing well,

There's only room for one, 
But I 
am never one but number two.

" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FistiEn's, 98 "Il'as 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say.that we recommend 
it to our youn g 
lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough. 
of it done without any furtherneeessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initia.L the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "ilirting." 1,, 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat 'ffitle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FisiiErt, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesktate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

American Fortune-Telling Cs:rds.—This is theeold-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs. Din. 
monds and Spades--and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
mad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arransed in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. Tee 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S.

iCourthig Cards.—This Serieb of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such e. way as to be non-co.nmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ntlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
