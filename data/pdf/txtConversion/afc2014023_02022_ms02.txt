Recording Title (informant or event): Mr. Jack Marucci 
Location of Interview: LSU FIELDHOUSE COMPLEX, Mr. Marucci’s Office, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 
 Recording Equipment: Marantz PMD 660 
 Format: WAV. 
  
Length of Interview: 55 min 8 sec 
 
 
 Note: Mr. Marucci’s full-time job is Director of Athletic Training at LSU; We interviewed him about his company, 
Marucci Sports, which makes world-famous baseball bats. This interview is somewhat post-modern, in that Mr. 
Marucci told his story while going through a slide-show of photographs, rendering the narrative less chronological.  
He also played YouTube videos of his company.  The video’s audio is recorded as part of the interview. Because of 
the nature of the interview, it was harder to get a coherent story about “the work.”  However, we collected, in 
pieces, the story of the work—as far as he would communicate.  He wouldn’t talk about “the secret sauce.”  
Finally, in this instance, it is hard to separate “the work” from “the fame,” since the fame of the bat is what drove 
the business.

00:03 
Interview begins straight-away with Mr. Marucci explaining that he will 
tell his story by going through a slide-show of photographs on his 
computer.  [He has agreed to share these photographs.]  In 2002, his son, 
Gino, asked to have a wooden bat for Little League, instead of the typical 
metal bat.  Because the major companies didn’t make wooden bats small 
enough for children, Mr. Marucci fabricated a wooden bat suitable for 
his son in a backyard shed in Baton Rouge. He says that the woodshop 
class he took at his hometown school in Uniontown, Pennsylvania was 
“the best class I’ve taken.”  He found some wood stock, and purchased a 
“cheap lathe,” imagining that he would make only one bat for his son.  
However, other parents wanted to purchase wooden bats for their 
children, so the business began to grow. At this time, he was working for 
the LSU football team as an athletic trainer.  He had to go to St. Louis for 
certification credits related to his work at LSU and ran into a player he 
had known when working at Florida State named Eduardo Perez, who 
was then playing in the major leagues.  Mr. Perez asked for Mr. Marucci 
to make him a couple of bats.  Mr. Marucci though he would use the bats 
only for practice. 
 
3:59 
When Mr. Perez first saw the bat, he rubbed on it and says, “Holy cow, 
this thing is really nice…I’m going to use this thing tonight.”  The bat 
wasn’t properly licensed at that time to be used in major league baseball, 
so the bat was sneaked into the game.  Mr. Marucci worried that the 
event could “blow up,” since the bat had only been used by a child prior 
to this. Mr. Marucci then changes the subject to explain a picture of his 
child in a number 21 jersey, in honor of Kliment(?) who was #21 with the 
Pittsburgh Pirates.

Mr. Marucci got the shed from Canada; it came in a kit which he had to 
assemble. (The man who helped him build it, Jay Chambra, now has a 
son, Chris, playing for LSU.)  To make the bat, Mr. Marucci says he went 
to “The University of Google.”  He would get “billets” (short, thick pieces 
of wood) and started working on his formula. 
 
6:48 
The topic  briefly shifts to the description of an article in Men’s Health, 
which was titled “Hitmaker.”  He returns to the main narrative, saying 
that he located a young bat company who would send him six pieces of 
wood stock at a time.  He then started cutting bats, and took them to 
Matt Mock, who was a National Championship winner in ’03 as 
quarterback for LSU.  Mr. Mock was his “go-to” person for advice on the 
taper of the bat.  A typical block of wood is about 37 inches long with a 
2.82 inches girth. 
 
8:02 
Maple is his Number One choice for wood.  He has purchased a wood 
mill, on an Amish farm, in Pennsylvania, which furnishes all the wood for 
the bats he makes today. He would hang one bat up and model the next 
bat after it, working freehand.  Then he discovered a “boning process,” 
where he presses the wood a little harder.  A photograph shows him 
using a cow femur. The boning process compresses the wood. 
 
10:01 
He describes a photo with Eduardo Perez, the first adult major league 
player who sneaked a bat into the game.  He mentions a picture of Barry 
Larkin on ESPN; Larkin is a “Hall of Famer or a potential Hall of Famer” 
who got the first hit with the bat, and it was also sneaked into the game. 
 
10:45 
He describes an early logo on Eduardo Perez’s bat which says “bone 
rubbed,” and has the figure of a little bone carved into it.  His logo is a 
water decal—the same used on children’s models.  He has now found a 
way to make the logos on computer printers. 
 
11:37 
He tells the story of Albert Pujols from 2004: “So as the story goes, 
Raymond Ramirez, who’s another very famous player with the Red Sox. 
The Red Sox always had a long time beating the Yankees. They always 
said it was the curse of Babe Ruth, that’s why they couldn’t beat them. I 
think 1918 was the last time they were able to win a world series. So I 
get a phone call from Manny, we’re playing Georgia, and he says, `Hey, I 
need three bats for the playoff run. We’re going to play the Yankees.’  I 
spent the night hand cutting three bats for him. So I send them up there, 
and next thing you know, I see them on TV being used—we’re not 
licensed yet—in one of the biggest games, ever. The Red Sox are down 
three games to none in the playoffs. If you won four, the Yankees just 
had to win one more, and the series was over. The odds were very, very, 
very low that the Red Sox were going to come back and beat them. They 
had to win four in a row, and there was no way they were going to do 
that. So I’m watching the game, and sure enough, they’re using these 
bats.” Orlando Cabrera was the player using the bat in the game. On his 
bat it says “CB” for “curse buster.” [The Red Sox won the series that 
year.]  In a meeting years later, Cabrera told Marucci that he had shaved 
the bat with scissors to think out the handle. 
 
14:40 
He describes the vinyl cutter he uses to make the logo.  He makes the 
logo through a computer program, which feeds into a mini-printer.  He 
demonstrates the logo on bats that he found—one in Seattle and one in 
Milwaukee on eBay.  The bats have a hand-stamped “born on” date.

Part 2: 
 
Jack Marucci 
1:28 
In the beginning, it took him several hours to make a bat; he eventually 
got it down to about 1 hour 50 minutes.   
 
1:50 
In 2004, Marucci brought in two partners, Kurt Ainsworth, who played 
for the Orioles, and Carlos Beltrand, who played for the New York Mets.  
Beltrand talked up the bats to other players, and it became widely used.  
They got licensed in 2005.  Ainsworth also built a backyard shop, which 
was bigger with a bigger lathe.  The two worked in his shop. 
 
3:32 
Marucci redesigned the logo to be more on an angle and with cleaner 
lines.  It is the logo used today. 
 
3:53 
Marucci describes the miniature ballpark in his backyard for his son and 
friends to play whiffle ball. He eventually moved houses to across the 
street, saying “he moved the shed over” a half-mile from the original 
house.  He describes many of the players who use the bat, including 
Albert Pujols who hit his 500th homerun with a Marucci bat.  The 
company now has 18-20 investors. 
 
5:36 
The company is expanding to make batting gloves of high-quality leather.  
They’ve also done bats for charity and for different nightclubs.  They’ve 
come up with their own humidor to protect the bats from moisture, so 
they can perform the same in all climates. They’ve tied in with Duck 
Dynasty to produce camo bats. 
 
7:09 
Because they are so particular about the bats, they have a “lot of 
excess.”  They may get a dozen acceptable bats out of 40 attempts.  The 
“leftovers” are sold as souvenirs.  A bat is acceptable when it is “really 
trimmed down” and excess and waste are eliminated. 
 
8:15 
President George Bush called Marucci bat “one of the greatest American 
stories.”   
 
9:22 
When asked by Jon Donlon if aluminum bats are made in a similar way, 
Mr. Marucci responds that they are “pulled in a certain way,” but he 
doesn’t know much about it. 
 
9:32 
He describes a photo of his shed, which stands today, with more aging on 
it.  It has gone through a “couple of hurricanes.”  He talks about his son, 
who is now playing baseball for the University of Houston, but has no 
interest in playing professionally.   
 
10:03 
Mr. Marucci describes the current bat-making process: When a player 
requests a certain model, he draws the model using AutoCad and CNC 
(computer numeric control).  [Interestingly, these are the same 
computerized tools used by Shavarsh in his jewelry making.]  The wood 
(which comes from the sawmill in Pennsylvania) is placed into a 
computerized machine, to cut it to the exact specs.  They make about 
150,000 wooden bats per year.

“The coat hanger is just a memory,” he says, referring to the days of 
hanging a bat from a hanger and hand-crafting a one modeled off it.  He 
says that the bats are made the same way, except for the CNC.  The 
wood is gotten from Pennsylvania, where they now have two mills.  The 
logs are cut into four-foot sections and then debarked and cut into 
squares.  The wood is then dried in a kiln.  One maple log produces about 
nine pieces of wood.  [He then digresses into more players who have 
used the bats to hit homeruns.] After the logs are kilned, they are 
FedExed to Baton Rouge. The kiln drying is a 9-10 day process. Then the 
squares are cooled, rounded, and packed in a pallet—about 200 per 
pallet—and shipped.  Once in Baton Rouge, the pieces of wood are 
weighed and graded.  “We know what weights and what qualities will 
make what particular bat.” 
 
14:45 
When asked how the bats are graded, he says “there’s a formula on that 
I can’t really give you.  It’s like the Coke recipe, a secret sauce.”  
However, the formula is what allows them “to find the best bats.”  They 
categorize the bats by weights and grades: “Then what we do is put it in 
a situation where we, for example, we know Albert Pujols, or whoever it 
is, this is his weight. So when he puts an order in, we know where to go 
in the section of the warehouse. We cut his bats, like I said we maybe cut 
forty or sixty bats for a dozen. That’s a lot of excess, but that’s what 
separates us.”

After the cut, the wood is again hand inspected.  A piece of wood will 
“probably go through about eleven sets of hands before being shipped 
out.”  When the wood comes off the CNC, it is hand sanded, hand 
sprayed, and painted.  They still do the boning procedure.  After the bat 
is painted, they decal them, put another coat, and laser engrave with a 
laser engraver.  Then they seal the bat one more time with a lacquer 
[they have developed their own lacquers and stains and produced 
through other companies], and then vacuum seal the final product so no 
moisture corrupts it.  “We’re the only company that does that.”  Then 
they pack them up and ship them out. 
 
2:30 
Marucci plays a video and talks over it, describing the grading and they 
are helping Albert Pujols pick out a piece of wood. The video is located at 
this web address: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mKPgPV9uGo.  
The goal is to make the wood as hard as possible.  The audio plays with 
the voice of Albert Pujols saying that his goal is to have a “good balance.”  
The video shows the process of making the bat: Albert picks out the 
wood, it is lathed, boned, sanded, laser cut, painted, and decaled.

Marucci plays another video, a story done by CBS This Morning, located 
at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkwYW4s2lEU.  The program 
aired on April 2, 2012.  This video also tells the story of Marucci bats, 
showing the shed where the bat-making first started and the 
development of the business, and includes interviews with players who 
use the bat.  Talking over the video, Marucci says that today, they “have 
the most bats used by players.”  He notes an article in USA Today that 
mentions the Marucci bat has surpassed the Louisville Slugger. He also 
mentions that they made souvenir bats for Charlie Rose and the other 
people on CBS This Morning.   
 
 
11:30 
He shows a final video segment done by Larry King, located at: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rYDwbKDXY8.  This 2 ½ minute 
video is another telling of the Marucci story from its beginnings to today. 
Marucci says “people know the story, but they don’t know the story.” 
 
 
14:13 
When asked to describe what a really great bat is, he replies: “What it is, 
is something that’s balanced very well, something that’s hand crafted 
with every little bit of detail in it—if it’s their number stamped in on the 
bottom, if it’s the date the bat was manufactured by hand—it’s hand 
polished, and when you pull it out of the bag, it’s like a piece of furniture. 
You almost don’t want to hit with it because it looks so good. And then 
once you hit with it, it’s the sound. It’s a very loud, cracking noise that 
you know that the ball will travel further than most bats, because of the 
density of the wood. You can just hear it in batting practice.”

When asked how a player chooses a bat, Marucci says that they’ll know 
based on what they’ve grown comfortable with. 
 
0:40 
They’ve created a finish which has become an official color for Major 
League baseball.  Only four-five colors are allowed. Things like weight can 
be customized.  The average is 31.5 ounce , 44 inch bat.  When a player 
gets up to bat, he/she can choose any bat.  But most players have their 
own model.  He points out a bat that is flexible and can bend.   
 
2:05 
He says that his favorite bat is his son’s—the first bat he made.  He has it 
at his house, but it isn’t on special display. 
 
2:27 
He says that the helmets are done by engineers through Kurt Ainsworth 
(now CEO of Marucci Sports).  They’ve created their own design and are 
doing research.  Helmet safety is their next big adventure.  “Our journey 
to get a helmet that has maybe sensors in it is something that we can 
look at.”  He is tying into his work as Athletic Trainer at LSU, using his 
medical knowledge. Curtis Cruz is heading up the sensor project.

He says that because they have their own wood mills, they don’t have to 
be so concerned about running out of resources.  The wood mills are 
owned separately by Jack, Kurt Ainsworth, and Joe Lawrence.  “That’s 
what happens to a lot of bat companies; they don’t have a resource. So 
we have that as a resource to keep the wood company going. That’s a 
huge step for us. As you saw Kurt in the video say, without that we 
wouldn’t make it as a wood bat company. So we secured that, and then 
had the foresight to say, `alright, this is what we’re going to need to do.’” 
He believes the quality of Amish craftsmanship is a big part of their 
success.  One sawmill is located in Louisburg, Pennsylvania, and another 
is located near Erie, Pennsylvania. 
 
4:25 
He gives a bit of history about the Louisville Slugger, which has been 
around for 125 or 126 years.  Adirondack and Rawlings are other big 
companies.  At present, there are about 40 licensed bat companies. Jack 
gives Kurt a lot of credit, along with Joe Lawrence. He also gives the 
players a lot of credit.  Because the players were the salesmen, Marucci 
Bats never had to do marketing.   
 
6:16 
He concludes the interview by saying that his son plays baseball for 
University of Houston, but the University uses Rawlings bats, not Marucci 
bats.  His son is glad to be independent and will probably pursue a 
different career.  He might want to play professional ball, but Jack 
doesn’t know if Gino has the talent.  He’s just glad that Gino got a 
baseball scholarship to go to college.  He has a great opportunity there.
