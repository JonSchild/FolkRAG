[Letter from Rolla A. Southworth to Florence Kerr,
August 29, 1939]
August 29, 1939
Mrs. Florence Kerr Assistant Commissioner Federal Works Agency Work Projects
Administration 1734 New York Avenue, N.W. Washington, D. C.
My dear Mrs. Kerr:
On August 16, Dr. Spivacke, Chief, Division of Music, Library of Congress, wrote Dr.
Carita Doggett Corse, State Director, Federal Writers' Project in Florida asking for a report
on the experience of the persons to be assigned to record Florida folk songs, using a
recording machine loaned by the Library of Congress. Dr. Corse's report has satisfied
Dr. Spivacke, and he has sent additional records for the machine and suggested that an
extension of time for use of the machine in Florida would be granted if a request were
made through official WPA channels, after it was known that the Florida Writers' Project
would be continued under the new program. Accordingly, may I ask that you make such
a request of Dr. Spivacke? The Florida folklore recording expedition, now in the field, is
gathering a rich assortment of folk songs and folklore, according to a report by Mr. Alton
Morris, editor of the “Southern Folklore Journal,” who surveyed the expedition's findings
on Friday, August 25. The extension of time for use of the machine should extend from
September 1 to, at least, October 1.
Thanking you for your co-operation in this matter.
Sincerely, Mrs. Rolla A. Southworth, State Director Division of Professional and Service
Projects Federal Works Agency Work Projects Administration
