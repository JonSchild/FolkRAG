BILLY TAYLOR. 
Billy Taylor was a 
brisk young fellow, 
Full of fin] and InA 
And Irs mind lie di I 
discover, 
To a 
lady fair and free. 
Four and twenty brisk young. fellows, 
Dres
.
,1 they were in rich array ; 
And ! hey took poor Billy Taylor, 
Whom they piess'd and sent to sea. 
Then his true love follow'd after, 
thider the name of Rieliard Carr ; 
Her lilly hands were soon daubed over, 
With the filthy pitch and tar. 
Now behold the first engagement, 
Boldly she fights among- I 
he rest, 
The wind it blew her jacket open, 
And discovered her milk- white breast, 
When the captain smiling viewed it, 
Said " what wind has blown you here /11 
'Sir, I 
come to seek my true love, 
Whom you press 'd 
and I 
love dear." 
'If you've come to seek your true love, 
Tell roe his name I 
pray ;' 
Sir, his name is Billy Taylor, 
Whom you pressed and Sent to sea.' 
'If his name is Billy Taylor, 
He is both cruel and severe: 
For rise up early in the morning, 
And you'll see him with his lady fair.' 
With that she rose up next mornin' 
Early by the break of day: 
And there she saw Billy Taylor, 
Dancing withAis lady gay. 
She then called for a 
sword and pistol, 
Which were brought at her command, 
And quickly shot bold Billy Taylor, 
With his true love in his band, 
When the captain came to know it, 
He much applauded ‘vhat she had done; 
And immediately made her first lieutenant, 
Of the glorious Thunder Bomb. 
nush'd is the clamorous trumpet of war, 
Hus 
hush'd is the trumpet of war ; 
The soldier's retired from the clangor of arms, 
The drum rolls a 
peaceful hurrah. 
mg cheering to think on the past, 
Ms cheering to think we've been true, 
'Tis cheering to look on our stars and our stripes. 
And gaze on our white, red and blue. 
Hurrah for the white, red and blue, 
Hurrah for the white, red and blue, 
'Tis cheering to look on our stars and our stripes, 
And gaze on our white, red and blue. 
Here's a 
sloth for the brave that are dead, 
Here's a 
sigh for the brave that are dead, 
And who would not sigh for the glorious brave, 
That rest on a 
patriot bed ? 
Ms glory, for country to die, 
'Tis glory that's solid and true ; 
*Tis glory to sleep ' fiend' our st ars and our stripes, 
And die for our white, red and blue. 
Hurrah for the white, red and blue, 
hurrah for the white, red and blue, 
"ris glory to sleep ' neatn our star: and our stripes, 
And die for the whit°, red, and blue 
There's freedom of thought and of deed, 
Here's Freedom in valley and plain. 
The first song of freedom that rose on our hills, 
Our sea-shore re-echoed again. 
"ris good to love country and friends, 
'Tis good to be honest and true: 
'Tis good to die shouting on sea, or on shore, 
hurrah for the white, red, and blue," 
hurrah for the white, red, and blue, 
Hurrah for the white, red, and blue, 
'Tis good to die shouting, at sea or on shore, 
" 
Hurrah for the white, red, and blue 1" 
Poor Bessy was a 
sailor's wife, 
And he was off to sea! 
Her only child was by her side, 
And who as sad as she ? 
"Forget me not, forget me not, 
When you are far front me; 
And whatsoe'er poor Bessy's 
She ‘vill remember thee I" 
As it was told to me; 
When Willy with a 
gladsome heart, 
Came home again from sea. 
He bounded up the craggy path, 
And sought his cottage door; 
But his poor wife and lovely child, . 
Poor Willy saw no more I 
"Forget me not, forget me not," 
The words rung in his ear; 
He asked the neighbors one by one, 
Each answered with a 
tear! 
They pointed to the old church yard, 
Anti there his youthful bride ; 
With the pretty child he loved so well, 
Were resting side by side I

THE HUNTERS OF KENTUCKY. 
Ye gentlemen and ladies fair,. 
Who grace this famous city, 
Just listen, if you've time to spare, 
While I 
rehearse a 
ditty ; 
And for the opportunity 
conceive yourselves quite lucky, 
For 'tis not often that you see 
A. hunter from Kentucky. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Kentucky 
the hunters of Kentucky 
We are a 
hirdy free-born race, 
Each man to fear a 
stranger; 
Whate'er the game we join in chase, 
Despising toil and danger; 
And if a 
daring foe annoys, 
Whate'er his strength and forces, 
We'll show hint that Kentucky boys 
Are alligator horses. 
Oh, Kentucky ! 
I 'spose you've read it in the prints. 
How Packenham attempted 
To make old Hickory Jackson wince— 
But soon his schemes repented ; 
For we with rifles ready cocked 
Thought such occasion lucky, 
And soon around the general flocked 
The hunters of Kentucky. 
Oh, Kentucky I 
ttc. 
You've heard, I 
s'pose, how New Orleans 
• 
is famed for wealth and beauty— 
There's girls of every hue, it seems, 
Front snowy white to sooty ; 
So Packenhatn he made his brags, 
If he in fight was lucky, 
He'd have their girls and cotton bags 
in spite of old Kentucky. 
' 
Oh, Kentucky ! (te:. 
THE HUNTERS OF KENTUCKY. 
[CONCLUDED.] 
But Jackson he was wide awake, 
And wasn't scared at trifles, 
For well he knew what aim we take 
With our Kentucky rifles; 
So he led us down to Cyprus swamp— 
The ground was low and mucky, 
There stood John Bull in martial pomp, 
And here was old Kentucky. 
Oh, Kentucky] Are. 
A bank was raised to hide our breast 
Not that we thought of 'dying, 
But then we always like to rest 
Unless the game is flying; 
Behind it stood our little force— 
None wished it to be greater, 
And every man was half a 
horse, 
And half an alligator. 
Oh, Kentucky I 
dre. 
They did not let our patience tire, 
Before they showed their faces— 
We did not choose to waste our fire, 
So snugly kept our places; 
But when so near to see them wink, 
We thought it time to stop 'em; 
And 'twould have done you good, I 
think, 
To see Kentuckians drop 'ern. 
Oh, Kentucky] tte. 
They found at last ' twas vain to fight, 
Where lead was all their booty; 
And so they wisely took to flight, 
And left us all our beauty. 
And now if danger e'er annoys, 
Rementher what, our trade is; 
Just send for us Kentucky boys, 
And well protect Yon, ladies. 
Oh, Kentucky I &c.

BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL. 
It was on the seventeenth, by break of day, 
The Yankees did surprise us; 
With their strong works they had thrown up, 
To burn the town and drive us. 
But soon we had an order come, 
Au order to defeat them; 
Like rebels stout, they stood it out, 
And thought we ne'er could beat them. 
About the hour of twelve that day, 
An order came for marching; 
With three good flints, and sixty rounds, 
Each man hoped to discharge them. 
We marched down to the Long Wharf, 
Where boats were ready waiting; 
With expedition we embark'd. 
Our ships kept cannonading. 
And when our boats all filled were, 
With officers and soldiers.; 
With as good troops as England had, 
To opptee who dare control us 
And when our boats all filled were, 
We row'd in line of battle; 
Where showers of ball like hail did fly, 
Our cannon loud did rattle. 
There Copp's Hill battery. near Charlestown, 
Our twenty-fours they played; 
And the three frigates in the stream, 
Thoy very well behaved. 
The Glasgow frigate elear'd the shore, 
All at the time of landing; 
With her grape-shot and cannon-balls, 
Ico Yankee e'er could. stand them. 
And when we landed on the shore, 
We draw'd up all together; 
The Yankees they all mann'd their works, 
And thought we'd ne'er come hither; 
Bat soon they did perceive brave Howe,. 
Bravo Ilowo, our bold eomander; 
With grenadiers. and infantry, 
We made them to surrender. 
Brave William Howe on onr right wing. 
Cried " Boys, fight on like hunder; 
You soon will see the rebels flee. 
With great amaze and wonder." 
Now sonic lay bleeding on the ground, 
And some fell fast a 
ruining; 
LI 1 
BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL.—[CoNCLUDW. 
O'er bills and dales, and mountains high, 
Cursing, t• Zuunds t

coming." 
Bravo Howe 
is so considerate, 
As to guard against all dangers; 
lie allowtd each half a 
gill a 
day, 
To rum we were no strangers. 
They began to play on our left wing, 
Where Bigot, he commanded; 
lint we returned it back again, 
With courage most undaunted. 
To our grape-shot and musket-balls, 
To whic • they were but strangers; 
They sought to come with tIV01 .11 in band, 
But soon they found their danger. 
And when their works were got into, 
And put them to the flight, sir; 
They pepper'd its, poor British elves, 
And show'd us they could tight, sir. 
And when their works we got into, 
With some hard knocks and danger ; 
Their works we found both firm and strong, 
Too strong for British Bangers. 
But as for our artillery, 
They gave all way and run ; 
For while their ammunition held, 
They gave us Yankee fun. 
But our commander, be got broke, 
For Ida miscond net, sure, sir; 
The shot he sent for twelve-pound guns, 
Were made for twenty-fours, sir. 
There's some in Boston pleased to say, 
As we the field were tahing ; 
We went to kid their countrymen, 
While they their hay -were making. 
For such stout wings 1 
never saw,* 
To hang them all I'd rather ; 
By making hay with musket balls, 
Lordllowe cursedly did bother. 
Bad luck to him by land and sea, 
For he's despised by many: 
The name of Bunker 11111 he dreads, 
Where he was flogg'd most plainly. 
And now my song is at an end, 
And to conclude toy ditty ; 
'Tie only Britens i; norant, 
That I 
most sin ct rely pity. 
As for our king and William Howe, 
And General Gage, if they're taken; 
The Yankees will h ang their beads up high.. 
On that fire hill, call'd Beacon.

OUR FIFER-BOY. 
Ara:—" ITAr 
BIRD, or, Dying Californian." 
While the battle hot was raging, 
And the shot and shell did fly, 
And smoke around our rigging curling, 
Then I 
heard a 
piercing cry. 
Close beside me lay our fifer; 
From his bosom spouted blood ; 
There he lay pierced by a 
bullet ; 
Dying in a 
crimson flood. 
Shipmates, said he, tell my father, 
Tell him I 
died like a 
nom, 
Died in battle for my Country, 
While blood, around, in torrents ran. 
Tell my mother, gently tell her, 
Lest the news should break her heart; 
Tell her that her son will meet her 
Where we never more shall part. 
Oh ! how sad I 
am to leave her 1 . 
How she'll mourn about toy loss I 
Her Charlie never more will greet her, 
Never more the ocean cross I 
Tell my sister, (Ilenven bless her'!) 
That her, brother is no more, 
Hand in band, no more we'll ramble 
On Old Hudson's pleasant shore! 
Tell my brother, im the army 
On Potomac's sunny shore, 
That our navy is victorious, 
And we'll be so evermore I 
Here he paused—and ceased from talking, 
Gently yielded up his breath ; 
heavenly smile lit up his features, 
And his-eyes were closed in death 
GOD WILL CARE FOR MOTHER NOW, 
A IR 
Who will care for Mother now." 
Weep no more, 0 nobly fallen 
Banish sorrow from thy heart ; 
Hark ! the angels, round thee hov'ring, 
Words of peace and joy impart. - 
Seel they bid you join their number, 
Wreath bright laurels round thy brow, 
Murm'ring, softly as they crown thee: 
God will care for mother now. 
Crioncs. 
Weep no more, 0 
nobly fallen! 
Let not sorrow cloud thy brow; 
Holy Angels round thee whisper: 
God will care for mother now. 
When that mother, sad and lonely, 
Mourns her loved and cherished one, 
When in agony she murmurs: 
Give me back my darling son! 
When she's crushed and bowed with trouble, 
And her heart is filled with fears; 
Then, the angels sweetly whisper : 
God will wipe away her tears. 
Weep no more, &c. 
Oh I 
how sweet those words of comfort 
To the dying soldier's ear 
'Who so anxiuosly is asking: 
" 
Who will cherish mother here, 
When I 
reach that land of glory, , 
r And before toy Maker bow?" 
Sweetly comes the whispered answer: 
God wilt care for mother now. 
Weep no more, &c.

Oh I 
Brigham, Brigham Young, It's a 
miracle how he survives; With his 
01-111; 
aij----a r.--4—m; 
-w • 
roaming rams and his pretty little lambs, And his five-and-forty wives. 
His number forty-five is about sixteen, 
Number one is sixty-and-three; 
And they make such a 
riot, 
flow he ever keeps them quiet, 
Is a 
down-right mystery to me. 
For they clatter and they claw, and jaw, jaw, jaw, 
And each has a 
different desire, 
It would aid the renown 
Of the best shop in town, 
To supply them with half they require.— Cho.

BRIGHAM YOUNG.—[CoscLuDED.] 
Old Brigham Young was a 
stout man once, 
Though now he is thin and old; 
And I 
grieve to state 
lie is bald on his pate, 
Which once had a 
covering of gold. 
For his youngest wives don't like white wool, 
And his old ones won't have red; 
So with tearing it out, 
Taking turn and turn about, 
They have torn all the hair from his head.—Cimaus 
Now his girls sing psalms all day, 
And his boys they all sing songs; 
And among such a 
crowd 
He has it pretty loud, 
For they are as musical as Chinese gongs. 
But when they advance, for a 
Mormon dance, 
lie is filled with the greatest surprise, 
For they're sure to end the night 
With a 
Tabernacle fight, 
And scratch out one another's eyes.—Cnoaus. 
There never was a 
home like Brigham Young's, 
So curious and so queer; 
If his joys are double, 
He's a 
treble lots of trouble, 
And it gains on him year by year. 
Yet he sits in state, and bears his fate, 
In a 
serve-me-very-right sort of way; 
If there's one wife to bury,— 
There's another one to marry, 
And there's something goes wrong everyday.—Cno. 
Now if anybody envies Brigham Young, 
Let them go to the Great Salt Lake, 
And if they have leisure 
To examine their pleasure, 
They will find it's a 
great mistake. 
One wife at a 
time, so says my rhyme, 
Is enough for the proudest Don ; 
So ere you strive 
To be lord of forty-five, 
Live happy,—if you can,—with one.—enottus.

THE GHOST OF POLLY ROCK AND HER 
TWO BANTLINGS. 
When I 
was but a 
tiny boy, 
And sailed on board a 
privateer, 
Three dreadful ghosts did me annoy, 
And to my sight did oft appear! 
A woman tall, who, on each arm, 
A 
little pale-faced bantling bore, 
And cried, " 01 we'll do no harm, 
For we, alas I 
are no more l" 
'The captain of your ship," she cried 
'My love and truth did sore betray: 
And these poor babes with me have died, 
Who might have lived another day?* 
'Dear ghost,' I 
said, ' all this is hard, 
If Captain Rock be such an elf, 
While I 
am watching on my guard, 
I 
think you'd better tell himself. 
She took the hint—down slid the ghost 
To where the Captain slept below; 
She drew the curtains to the posts, 
And pale she gazed as drifted snow t 
'I'm come,' she cried, ' bold Captain Rock, 
To plague thy heart our ghosts are come, 
Full cold I 
am as marble block, 
And eke the youeg ones, Sal and Torn." 
'Dear Polly Rock,' the Captain said, 
And trembled much as he thus spoke; 
'I never beard that you were dead, 
And fear, my love, that you but joke.' 
To prove her truth they vanished straight, 
And at their heels a 
fiery flame ; 
The Captain roared out for his mate, 
Drank off his grog— and slept again.

I 
D.13,F,Afu'IED MY BOY WAS HOYLE AGAIN. 
Lonely, weary, broken-hearted, 
As I 
laid me down to sleep, 
Thinking of the day we parted, 
When you toid no tint to weep ; 
Soon I 
dreamed that peaceful Angt.:Is 
Hovered o-er the battle- plain, 
Singing songs of ity anti gladness, 
And my boy was home again. - 
C1101t1.73. 
How well I 
know such thoughts of joy, 
Such dreams of bliss are vain ! 
My heart is sad, my tears will flow, 
Until my boy is home lig-LOLL 
rears were changed to loud rejoicings, 
Night was turned to endless day, 
Loving birds were sweetly singing, 
Flowers blooming in light array; 
Old and young seemed lig•ht and cheerful, 
Peace seemed everywhere to reign, 
My poor heart forgot its sorrow ; 
For, my boy was home again / 
How well I 
know, (Ix. 
But the dream is past: and with it 
All my happiness is gone: 
Cheerful thoughts of joy have vanished, 
I 
must still in sorrow mourn ; 
Soon may peace with all its blessings, 
Our unhappy land reclahn, 
Then my tears will cease their flowing. 
And my boy be home again! 
How well I 
know, (te. 
Bring my brother back to me, 
When this war is done; 
Give us all the joys we shared, 
Ere it had begun ; 
Oh ! bring my brother back to me, 
Never more to stray ! 
This is all my earnest prayer, 
Through the weary day. 
CHORUS. 
CHORUS. 
Bring him back, bring him back, 
With his smiling, healthful glee; • 
Bring him back, bring him back, 
Bring my brother back to we ! 
All the house is lonely now, 
And my voice no more, 
In the pleasant summer eves; 
Greets him at the door. 
Never more I 
hear his step 
By the garden gate, 
While I 
sit in anxious tears, 
Knowing not his fate.' 
Bring my brother sack to me, 
From the battle strife; 
Thou who watchest o'er the good. 
Shield his precious life! 
When this war has pased away, 
Safe from all alarms; 
Bring my brother lo me again, 
To my longing arms!

Our Jimmy has gone for to live in a 
tent, 
They have grafted him into the army ; 
He finally puckered up courage and went, 
When they grafted him into the army. 
I 
told them the child was too young : alas I 
At the Captain's fore quarters, they say, he would pass, 
They train'd } dill up well in the infantry class— 
So, they grafted him into the army.

Jimmy, farewell ! your brothers fell 
Way down in Alabartny; 
I 
thought they would spare a 
lone widder's heir, 
But they grafted him into the army. 
Dressed up in his unicorn, dear little chap I 
They have grafted him into the army : 
It seems but a 
day since he sot in my lap; 
But they grafted him into the army : 
And these are the trousers, he used to wear— 
The very same buttons—the patch and the tear— 
But Uncle Sam gave him a 
bran new pair, 
When they grafted him into the army-. 
0, Jimmy, farewell ! & c. 
Now, in my provisions I 
see him revealed, 
They have grafted him into the army; 
A picket beside the contented field, 
They have grafted him into the army. 
He looks kinder sickish—begins to cry, 
A big volunteer standing right in his eye ! 
Oh ! what if the ducky should up and die, 
Now they've grafted him into the army.

ALL WE ASK IS TO BE LET ALONE. 
As vonce I 
valked by a 
dismal swamp, 
There sot an Old Cove in the dark and damp, 
And at every body as passed that road 
A 
stick or a 
stone this Old Cove throwed. 
And venever he flung his stick or his stone 
He'd set up a 
song of " Let me alone." 
"Let me alone, I 
loves to shy 
These bits of things at the passers-by— 
Let me alone, for I've got your tin 
And lots of other traps snugly in— 
Let me alone, I'm rigoin' a 
boat 
To grab votever you' ye got afloat— 
In a 
veek or so I 
expects to come 
And turn you out of your ' ouse and 'mike— 
I'm a 
quiet Old Cove," says he, vith a 
groan; 
"An I 
axes is—Let me alone." 
Just then came along, on the self-same way, 
Another Old Cove, and began for to say.— 
" 
Let you alone I That's coming it strong !— 
You've ben let alone—a 
darned sight too long— 
Put down that stick I (you may well look sheered); 
Let go that stone ! 
If you once show fight, 
MI knock you higher than an'' kite. 
You must have a 
lesson to stop your trieks, 
And cure you of shying them stones and sticks, 
And I'll have my hardware bad( and 
m y 
cas h, 
And knock your scow into tarnal smash, 
And if ever I 
catches you round my ranche, 
I'll string you up to the nearest branch. 
The best you can do is to go to bed. 
And keep a 
decent tongue in your head ; 
For I

KINDLY WORDS AND SMILING FACES. 
Though our way is dark and dreary, 
And we toil from day to day; 
While the heart is sad and weary, 
At our home there shines a 
ray.

Kindly words and smiling faces, 
Gentle voices as of yore; 
Loving kisses and embraces, 
Ever wait us at the door.

Here we never look in vain ; 
For the soothing tones that wake us 
Back to joy and peace again.

INDEPENDENCE DAY. 
Squeak the life and beat the drum, 
Independence day has come, 
Let the roasting pig be bled, 
Quick twist off the rooster's head, 
Quickly rub the pewter- platter. 
Heap the nut cakes, fried in butter; 
Set the cup g 
and beaker-glass, 
The pumpkin and the apple-sauce. 
Send the keg to shop for brandy: 
Maple sugar we have handy. 
Independent, staggering Dick, 
A noggin mix of swinging thick; 
Sal put on your russet skirt, 
Jonathan get your boughten shirt, 
To-day we dance to tiddle diddle— 
There comes Sambo with his fiddle. 
Sambo, take a 
dram of whiskey, 
And play us Yankee Doodle friskey. 
Moll, come leave your wicked tricks, 
And let us have a 
reel of six. 
Father and mother shall make two— 
Sal, Moll, and I 
stand all a 
row ; 
Sambo, play and dance with quality, 
This is the day of blest equality-.

INDEPENDENCE DAY. [coni.unr.n. 
Father and mother are but men, 
And Sambo—is a

Come foot it Sal—Moll, figure in, 
And mother, you dance up to him. 
Now saw as fast as ever you can do, 
And father von cross over to Samber. 
Thus we dance and thus we play, 
On glorious Independent Day. 
Encore Verses. 
Rub more rosin on your bow, 
And let us have another go— 
Zoundsl as sure as eggs and bacon, 
Here's ensign Sneak, and uncle Deacon, 
Aunt Tidal), and there's Bets behind her, 
On blundering mare, than beetle blinder, 
And there's the squire, too, with his lady: 
Sal, hold the beast, I'll take the baby-
Moll, bring the squire the great arm-chair, 
Good folks we're glad to see you here,— 
Jonathan get the great case bottle, 
Your teeth can pull its corn-cob stopple. 
Ensign—Deacon, never mind, 
Squire drkk until you're blind— 
Thus we drink and dance away, 
This glorious Independent Day.

THE PILLAR OF GLORY. 
Hail to the heroes, whose triumphs have brighten'd 
The darkness which shrouded America's name I 
Long shall their valor, in battle that lighten'd, 
Live in the brilliant escutcheons of fame. 
Dark where the torrents flow, 
And the rude tempests blow, 
The stormy clad spirit of Albion raves; 
Long shall she mourn the day, 
When in the vengeful fray, 
Liberty walk'd like a 
god on the waves. 
CHORUS. 
Long shall she mourn the day, 
When, in the vengeful fray, 
Liberty walk'd like a 
god on the waves. 
The ocean, ye chiefs, ( the region of glory, 
Where fortune has destined Columbia to reign,) 
Gleams with the halo and lustre of story, 
That curl round the wave as the scene of her fame— 
There, on its raging tide, 
Shall her proud navy ride, 
The bulwark of freedom, protected by Heaven ; 
There shall her haughty foe 
BOW to her prowess low, 
There shall renown to her heroes be given. 
Long shall. dce. 
The pillar of glory, the sea that enlightens, 
Shall last till eternity rocks on its base; 
The splendor of fame, its waters that brightens, 
Shall light the footsteps of time in his race. 
Wide o'er the stormy deep, 
Where the rude surges sweep, 
Its lustre shall circle the brows of the brave; 
honor shall give it light, 
Triumph shall keep it bright, 
Long as in battle we meet on the wave. 
Long shall, & c. 
Already the storm of contention has hurl'd 
From t 
he gr.,sp of old England the trident of war ; 
The beams of our stars have illumined the world, 
Unfurl'd our standard beats proud in the air— 
Wild glares the eagle's eye, 
Swift as he cuts the sky, 
Marking the wake where our heroes advance; 
Compass'd with rays of light, 
Hovers he o'er the fight— 
Albion is heartless, and stoops to his glance. 
Long shall, cte. 
THE DEAD AT BUENA VISTA, 
AIR :—" Burial of Sir John Moore." 
Nobly be stood in the midst of the fight, 
With the flag of the west waving o'er him ; 
And its star-spangled folds were the pride oi his sight 
With the foes of his country before him. 
Where the battle was fierce o'er ti e 
rugged ravine, 
lie thought not of pause or surrender; 
But foremost and first of his ranks be was seen, 
The nation's unshrinking 
efender. 
At wild Buena Vista the foe he had met. 
To contend for his country and glory; 
And twice o'er the fight, ere the red sun had set, 
lie fell on the battle- field gory. 
" 
Oh, give to my sire my weapons," he cried, 
"I have used them as duty commanded— 
Press ye on to the fight," he repeated, and died 
As his soul for his country expanded. 
They buried him there on the field of the fray, 
With the funeral guns o'er him booming; 
To sleep till conducted in silence away, 
Where the soil of Kentucky was blooming. 
They mourn'd for the fallen at Ashland's retreat, 
On the joyless return of the morrow; 
And the heart of the nation in unison beat, 
With the throbbings of filial sorrow. 
His relics they bore from their war crimson'd bed 
That his bones might his birth-sod encumber ; 
And many a 
tear for the hero was shed 
O'er the last hallow'd place of his slumber, 
An army of friends form'd his burial train, 
And with funeral garlands they crown'd him; 
And they laid him to rest, and they let him remain 
With the flag of his country around him

THE DOWNHILL OF LIFE. 
i• 
In the downhill of life when I 
find I'm declining, 
May my fate no less fortunate be, 
Than a 
snug elbow chair can afford for reclining„ 
And a 
cot that o'erlooks the wide sea; 
IVE•h an ambling pad pony to pace o'er the lawn, 
While I 
carol away idle sorrow ; 
And blithe as the lark that each day hails the dawn, 
Look forward with hope for to-morrow. 
With a 
porch at my door, both for shelter and shade too, 
As the sunshine or rain may prevail, 
And a 
small spot of ground for the use of the spade too, 
With a 
barn for the use of the flail. 
A cow for my dairy, a 
dog for my game, 
And a 
purse when my friend wants to borrow; 
I'd envy no nabob his riches or fame, 
Or the honors that wait him to-morrow. 
From the bleak northern blast, may my cot be completely 
Secured by a 
neighboring hill. 
And at night may repose steal on me more sweetly, 
By the sound of a 
murmuring rill. 
And while peace and plenty I 
find at my board, 
With a 
heart free from sickness and sorrow, 
With my friends will I 
share what to-day may afford, 
And let them spread the table to-morrow. 
And when I 
at last must throw off this frail covering, 
Which I've worn for years three-score and ten ; 
On the brink of the grave I'll not seek to keep hovering, 
Nor my thread wish to spin o'er again ; 
• 
But my faue in the glass 
serenely survey, 
And with smiles count each wrinkle and furrow; 
As this -worn out old stuff, which is thread-bare to-day, 
May become everlasting to-morrow.

AS TIIROUGH THE WORLD YOU GO. 
Now if you'll all attention give, 
A 
song I'll try and sing, 
For those just starting life alone, 
I 
think 'twill be the thing; 
To 
give advice whene'er I 
can, 
You'll never find me slow, 
So 
the title l've selected is, 
" 
As 
through the world you go." 
Cl/ORM—As 
thro' the world you go, my boys, 
As 
through the world you go, 
Do all you can to be an upright man, 
As 
through the world you go. 
Be with your lot contented, boys, 
Never covetous be, 
And always think that " honesty 
Is the best of policy." 
VI-gotten wealth will seldom 
Bring comfort we all know, 
So mind you're always honest, 
As through the wor!d you go. 
Do unto others as you would 
That they -d 
do unto you. 
Treat those above you with respect, 
Be to your equals true. 
To those that are beneath you, 
A good example show, 
And thus you'll be a 
useful man 
As through the world you go. 
As thro', 
Always mend in yourself the faults 
In others you may see, 
Never he mean but think ' tis almost 
As bad as to be too free; 
No man can reach perfection, 
Of course we all well know, 
But be as new it as you can, 
As through the world you go. 
As thro', &c. 
The man that does as I 
have said, 
Will ne'er have cause to fret, 
And when life is near ending, 
Can look back without regaet. 
He dies respected and beloved, 
Which to you all will show, 
'Tis best to be upright and fair, 
As through the world you go. 
As thro',

THE MEN OF CHURITBUSCO. 
They'11 point them out in after years, 
The men of Churubusco fight! 
And tender h 
at ts will name with tears, 
The gallant spirits quench'd in night. 
When each who under Winfield fought, 
And kept the field alive ; 
Was equal, in the deeds he wrought, 
To any common five. 
They'll point them out, those vet'ran's then, 
As far beyond till common men ; 
And each to each, with stern delight, 
iVill name the Churubusco fight. 
They'll sing their praise, when they're no more, 
The men of Churubusco fight! 
And when their latest march is o'er— 
As one by one is lost to sight—. 
Then girls will ask his friends to spare, 
From off that hoary brow, 
A shred but of the scattered hair 
Which waves so richly now. 
And loiterers by the inn-side hearth 
Will panse amid their tavern mirth, 
And, filling, fear since he has pass'd, 
They drink " To Churnbusco's last!" 
They'll paint their deeds in statned hall— 
The deeds of Churubusco fight! 
And, on the smoke-dried cottage wall, 
Will smile their pictures, brave and bright, 
Who fought with stalwart Scott of yore, 
That glorious field to win— 
When every warrior bosom bore 
Five hero hearts within! 
They'll legends tell of heroes, then, 
Far, far beyond all modern men! 
And still in song will grow more bright, 
The deeds of Churubusco fight!

Though tempests howl along the main,

With cheerful hearts the shore we reach 
Our friends delighted greet us, 
And tripping lightly o'er the beach, 
The pretty lassies meet us. 
When the full flowing bowl enlivens the soul, 
To foot it we merrily lead them ; 
And each bonny lass will drink off her glass 
To America, Commerce, and Freedom. 
Our prizes sold, the chink we share, 
And gladly we receive it ;

To relieve the distress'd, clothe and feed them,

In this land of Commerce and Freedom. 
ALWAYS PERSEVERE, 
Composed by ALBERT LBIGHTON 
In story books of Whittington, 
A 
legend oft is told, 
ilow he, poor lad, become Lord Mayor, 
Possessed of lots of gold ; 
'Tis easy to define how he 
Suceeded, for ' tis dear, 
The secret of success in life 
Is always persevere. 
CITOREE. 
For while there is life there's hope, boys, 
Have courage, never fear ! 
Success will crown your efforts if 
You always persevere. 
I 
like to see a 
fellow try 
To prove himself a 
man, 
And ne'er give way, but bravely meet 
Misfortune while he ,can. 
Though fortune for a 
time may frown, 
Upon us as we steer 
Through life, all care will venish if 
We only persevere. 
For while, cEc. 
A faint heart never yet was known 
A. lady fair to win, 
For too much bashfulness I've found 
Is looked upon as sin.. 
Go in, be nothing daunted, boys. 
And cast aside all fear, 
I'm sure 'you'll be successful if 
You always persevere. 
For while, &c. 
Then jog along together, boys, 
Upon life's thorny road, 
And ne'er give way to sorrow, for 
Each man must bear his load; 
But try to help each other 
The short time you are here, 
And cry when trouble meets you. 
I'll always persevere.

SOFT GLIDES THE SEA. 
Soft glides the sea, 
Bounding and free, 
Dance the blue waves, as they rush to the shore; 
O'er vale and height 
Gleams the moon bright, 
Gaily the Mariner plies the swift oar, 
Singing awhile, ' Ere the sun lights the main, 
Laud of my birth, I 
shall greet thee again." 
Night wears away; 
Sullen and grey 
Frowns the dark sea ; o'er the wild restless deep 
lightning's red flash, 
Thunder's loud crash 
Now quiver and peal—` Go, Mariner, weep; 
Haply I 
deem, though the sun lights the main, 
Its rays to thy land shall not greet thee again.' 
Tempests are fled ; 
Morning hath shed 
Light from her eye and balm from her breat h; 
All things rejoice ; 
Heard is the voice 
Of the Mariner now singing praises of home, 
The ship's gallant prow presses on through the main, 
And he treads on the land of his fathers again. 
THE HEAVING OF THE LEAD. 
For England when, with fav'ring gale, 
Our gallant ship up channel steer'd; 
And scudding under easy sail, 
The high, blue western laud appear'd. 
To heave the lead the seaman sprung, 
And to the pilot cheerly sung, 
" 
By the deep, Nine, 1" 
And bearing up to gain the port, 
Some well-known object kept in view, 
An abbey-tower, an harbor- fort, 
Or beacon, to the vessel true— 
While oft the lead the seaman flung, 
And to the pilot cheerly sung, 
" 
By the mark, Seven !" 
And as the much-loved shore we near, 
With transport we behold the roof 
'Where dwelt a 
friend, or partner dear, 
Of faith and love a 
matchless proof; 
The lead once more the seaman flung. 
And to the watchful pilot sung, 
"Quarter less five!"

I SAW A BOBBY GRIN.

Air,—" I 
heard a 
Spirit Sing." 
I'm sure 'twas not a 
fancy, and 
I'm sure ' twas not a 
dream; 
And I'll ne'er forget the couple which 
By me that night was seen. 
It was near the Mall at Clifton, when 
The nights were drawing in, 
A 
sly Cook these words were saying, 
And I 
saw a 
Bobby grin. 
Take it dear, take it dear, 
'Tis a 
plate of nice cold mutton, 
Take it dear, take it dear. 
The stars were just appearing, and 
The lamps had just been lit, 
And the Bob'.3r seem.d 
delighted with 
The Cook to chat a 
bit. 
She was fat as any porpoise, he 
As lean as any shark, 
How she kissed him as she whispered, 
To her _Bobby in the dark. 
Take it, dear, &c. 
He soon devoured the mutton, and 
Then bade his love good-night, 
And she watched him from the railings. 
Until he was out of sight. 
I 
shall think where'er I'm living, 
When the days are drawing in, 
Of that fat Cook, and the Bobby, 
And the mutton, and the grin. 
Take it dear, &c. 
THE HERO OF CHAMPAGNE. 
By 
Taowniunc.n. 
Ant :—Moet and Shandon. 
Good evening friends, pray how do you do ? 
I've come to see you once again. 
Last time I 
came into this 
My drink it was sparkling Champagne, 
To recognise ma you all seem slow. 
0:1! I 
oh I (
It I 
oh ! 
I'm Champagne Charlie Pd have you to know, 
011 ! I 
oh I 
oh ! I 
oh? 
CHORUS. 
Yes, I'm ' Champagne Charlie,' broken down, 
Fortune s 
,ems on me to frown, 
But still I 
hope to be :
wain, 
A g:orious hero of Champagne. 
Not, long ago. I 
a 
fortune had, 
But to gain renown went it rather fast, 
In fact the pace was killing, 
And my friends all said it could not la:A, 
But still I 
with pride ahead did go, 
Oh ! & c. 
And now you can see it's brought me to woe. 
Oh ! dr,c. 
Yes, lin, dtc. 
Now when I 
think of days gone by, 
And of the great renown I've gained, 
it makes my heart beat high with pride, 
Nearly everything after we was named. 
" 
Champagne Charlie hats was once all the go, 
Oh 
Worn by roughs of the East, and Swells of the Row," 
Oh! &c. 
Yes, I'm, 8:c. 
Now if fortune is as fickle as they say, 
Perhaps s.te'll smile on me again, 
And n'tik- me as of old, my Boys, 
A I 
o)le hero of Champagne. 
So I'll utver give way to despair, oh no, 
But always be cheerful where'er I 
go, 
Oh ! ttc. 
Yes, rm, AC.

YE 
3, I HAVE DARED TO LOVE THEE. 
Yes, I 
have dared to love thee, 
Cold and senseless thou2,11 I 
seem ; 
And sweet have been the phantasies, 
Of this my heart's first dream. 
The sun does not a 
brighter beam 
On all creation pour; 
Than that which now lights up the mind, 
Where all was dark before. 
Alike he shines on hill and dale, 
On valley, mount an.1 sea ; 
And as lie is to one of these, 
Thou art even that to me. 
'Twits not thy beauty that enthrall'd, 
And yet thy form is fair; 
The painter's eye would love to dwell 
On all the graces there. 
It was thy mental loveliness, 
That bound my soul to thine; 
And made me dream of happiness. 
Oh, can it e'er be mine ? 
Thy magic tones have lured me, 
Into paths before untrod ; 
And led my wandering spirit back, 
A captive to its God. 
Yes, still this lonely heart must love, 
Even I 
knew not how well; 
Until the bli-ht of sickness 
On thy youthful beauty fell. 
I 
thought ' twos admiration, 
And esteem I 
felt before;

Then chide me not, if I

Thou heist made me love thee lovely, 
Then can I 
help loving thee. 
THE BLIGHTED GARDENER, 
OR, ' CABBAGES AND TUIINIPT0DS: 
Sung by HADRY RICKARDS. 
I 
once kept a 
garden where the vegetables did grow, 
But my fate is a 
hard ' nn, you'll say when you know 
How I 
loved a 
fair damsel. whose like I 
ne'er saw, 
So graceful and so beautiful, that, I 
loved her far more than 
all— 
CHORUS. 
My cabbages and my turniptops, 
My celery and my brokelo; 
0 
I'll never love, no, I'll never lova 
None but sweet Mary Jones. 
Her parents kept a 
beer shop, Mary served at the bar, 
And used to draw custom from ever so far, 
With her eves bright as diamonds, and hair black rvs jet, 
She made me feel so funuified, and entirely forget all about— 
My cabbages, ti:e. 
When I 
stood at the bar, I 
would heave a 
deep sigh, 
And when she looked at me, I'd wink one eye; 
I 
one day pluck'd up courage, looled as wretched as could be, 
Said ' I 
love you, sweet Mary 0 ! will you have me ?' and all— 
My cabbages, •Szc. 
Out of the Bar-Parlor rushed a 
sailor pell mell, 
Turned me out of the house, and shook me as well I 
The naughty boys jeer'd me, with mud I 
got splashed, 
Then they followed me home, yes, and smashed all— 
My cabbages, cte. 
Well she married that sailor, she's now a 
gay wife, 
She's left this poor gardener all wretched for life, 
My sufferings and misery there'sno one can tell, 
I'm a 
melancholy Horticulturist, and here bids farewell to all—

A BALLAD FOR TIIE 4Th I

By A.

II. 
D UGANNE. 
AIR:—" Twenty years ago." 
Oh I 
how the Past comes over me— 
llow the Old Days draw nigh: 
Tramping along in batalia— 
Marching in legions by, 
With the drums of the Old Time beating, 
And the Old Flag waving high I 
And down from the mountain-gorges, 
And up from the woodlands low, 
Mustering for Liberty's Conflict— 
Eighty-five years ago I 
Out of the streets of Lexington 
I 
see the red-coats wheel; 
And back from the lines of Bunker, 
Where Continentals kneel 
And pray, with their iron musketry, 
I 
see the red--
coats reel ; 
And reddening all the greensward, 
mark the life-blood flow 
From the bos mi of martyr'd Warren— 
Eighty-five years ago! 
Harken to Stark, of Hampshire ; 
"Ho 1 
comrades all 1" quoth he— 
" 
King George's Hessian hirelings, 
On yonder plains, ye see! 
We'll beat them, boys ! or Mary Stark 
A widow this night shall be F' 
And then like a 
clap of thunder, 
He broke upon the foe, 
And he won the battle of Bennington— 
Eighty-five years ago! 
Down from the wild Green Mountains 
Our fearless eagle swooped— 
Down on Ticonderoga 
Bold Ethan Allen stooped 
[I] 
*dm-
EIGHTY-FIVE YEAR3 AGO. [CONCLUDED.] 
And the royal red-cross banner 
Beneath his challenge drooped 
And the stout old border fortress 
He gained, without a 
blow, 
"In the name of the Great Jehovah!" 
Eighty-five years ago ! 
Out from the resonant belfry 
Of Independence Hall, 
Sounded the tongue of a 
b2azen bell, 
Bidding good patriots all 
To give the Oppri.sed their Freedom, 
And loosen every thrall; 
And the voice of brave John Hancock, 
Preached to the people below, 
The Gospel of Independence— 
Eighty -five years ago ! 
And out from Sullivan's Island, 
From dark palmet to fen, 
I 
hear the roar of cannonrv, 
And the rifle-shots again ; 
And the voice of valiant Moultrie, 
And the shouts of Marion's men! 
And I 
see our stricken banner 
Snatched from the ditch below, 
By the hand of Sergeant Jasper— 
Eighty-five years ago! 
So, the Old Days come over me— 
The past around me rolls ; 
And the spell of a 
glorious History 
My yearning sense controls, 
And I 
sing of the Grand Example 
Of old and loyal souls, 
When the land we love lies bleeding, 
And we hear her hearts's wild throe, 
Let us think, of the Old, Old Union— 
Eighty-five years ago!

FORTY YEARS AGO. 
'Tis now same forty years ago, 
A man was in his prime ; 
And forty years ago to him 
Was then a 
merry time. 
His heart was happy, light, and free, 
But time has brought him low ; 
Still he can with pleasure speak 
Of forty years ago. 
He gave to those who sought his 
The poar ne'er left his door; 
And shelter to the iriendless gave, 
For relief he gave in store. 
But age has now passed o'er his head, 
lie's sew. each friend laid 
; 
And all his youthful days are tied, 
Full forty years ago. 
Now all my once lo Ned friends are dead, 
The old man breathed a 
sigh; 
And am left alone to weep, 
Of happy days gone by. 
Now everything to me seems strange, 
This laud I 
scarcely know ; 
For all thil1 , 4 now are changed 
Since forty years ago. 
CONE LET US BE HAPPY TOGETHER. 
Come and let us be happy together, 
For where there's a

And the heart be as light as a

Who knows not the way is a

If wronged, never dream of resentment, 
Get rid of such folly at once, 
Listen to me ! 
To be kind is the way to meet kindness, 
If not, what's the use of regret. 
Rail not at the world for its blindness, 
But pity, forgive and forget. 
Our old friends no doubt will be true friends, 
The longer we love them the more. 
But shut not your eyes against new friends,

THE STOLEN CHILD. 
Alone on the heather a 
fart- child was straying, 
Whose innocent features was brightened with joy; 
And as 'mid the flowers he careless was pla:,ing, 
3Iy heart yearned with love and I 
spoke to the boy. 
'Young stranger whence art thou I ' his blue eyes upturning, 
Ile answered, •' My home is you tent on the plain ; 
And ere the eve closes I 
must be returning, 
Or they will not let me roam hither again." 
"Do thy paints await thee?" he paused and the gladness 
That mantled his brow was o'ershadowed in gloom, 
"I saw them but once ;" and he added with sadness, 
They tell me that both are asleep in the tomb. 
The gipsy is kind, but my mother was fonder, 
She sang me so sweetly to rest in her arms ; 
But now she is gone, and her darling must wander 
Though the soft 'words sl e 
whispered my bosom still warms." 
"And soon will I 
seek them where both are reposing, 
And take my best flowers to plant by their side ; 
That summer, when all their bright tints are unclosing, 
May bless the green turf with their beauty and pride." 
Rebounded away, while my tears were fast falling, 
To think how the gipsy such love had beguiled; 
I 
saw him no more but the sad tale recalling 
I 
often remember the poor stolen child. 
THOU ART GONE FROM IYIY GAZE. 
Thou art gone from my gaze, like a 
beautiful dream, 
And I 
seek thee in vain by meadow and stream ; 
Oft I 
breathe thy dear name to the winds floating by, 
Bat thy sweet voice is mute to my bo-orn's long sigh. 
In the stillness of night, when the stars teldly shine, 
My heart fondly holds a 
communio•I n itit thine; 
For I 
feel then art near, and where'er I 
may be, 
That thy spirit of lo ve keep a 
watch over me. 
Of the birds in thy how'r, companiors I 
make, 
Ev'ty simple wild-flower do I 
prize tor thy sake; 
In deep woods ad dark wilds now a 
pleasure impart, 
For their solitude suits my sad sorrow-worn heart. 
Thou art gone from mygaze. yet I 
will not repine. 
Ere long we shall meet in the home that's now thine; 
For I 
feel thou art near, and where'er I 
may be, 
That thy spirit of love keeps a 
watch over me.

THE OLD WOMAN AND HER CATS. 
A very old woman once liv'd by herself, 
In a 
garret so monstrously high, 
Her cupboard was 
well stored was each shelf, 
And in a 
sly pocket ha • I 
plenty of pelf, 
To get a 
drop of liquor when dry. 
But the rats and the mice through the boles, 
Came into the cupboard in shoals, 
So free exercising their gums, 
On cheese-parings, candle- ends and crumbs. 
And though it a 
strange thing may seem, 
They wasli'd their tails in the cream, 
Which was shocking bad manners you'll say, 
Alas, and alack a-day; 
CHORUS. 
A 
curious moral I 
make, 
Listen great and small, 
Better have some crumbs for the mice to take, 
Than to have no crumbs at all. 
Plagued out of her life, ah, what could she do ? 
She collected of cats fifteen, 
And went to bed with them all in her view, 
There was black, white, and tabs', and tortoiseshell, too, 
With their gooseberry eyes so green, 
But the candle was scarcely out, 
They made such a 
confounded rout, 
Seizing the victuals, and tearing, 
Clawing, and spitting, and swearing, 
Broke cups, plates and dishes, all her store, 
Lap'd the cream up and inolrow'd for more, 
Which was shocking bad manners you'll say, 
Alas and alack a-day, 
A curious moral I 
make, &c. 
They made such a 
noise, she awoke with afright, 
Not dreaming the cause of the din, 
Groped out her tinder-box, and then struck a 
light, 
And the very first object- that came in her sight, • 
Was—her bottle broke, and spilt all her gin ; 
She look'd in the cupboard in despair, 
But the devil of anything was there, 
Except plates and dishes broken small, 
Cups, saucers, and cream jug, and all. 
Each eat looked as savage as a 
cur, 
As if he could easily swallow her, 
Which was shocking bad mariners you'll say, 
So the poor old woman run away.

THE SOLDIER'S FUNERAL, 
Hark! to the shrill trumpet calling, 
It pierces the soft summer air; 
Tears from each comrade are falling, 
For the widow and orphan are there; 
Bayonets earthward are turning, 
The drum muffled voice breathes around, 
Yet he heeds not the voice of the mourner, 
Nor wakes to the soft bugle's sound. 
Sleep, soldier, tho' many may mourn thee, 
And weep o'er thy cold form to day; 
Soon, soon will thy kindred forget thee, 
Thy name from the earth pass away; 
The man thou hast loved as a 
brother, 
Some friend in thy place shall have gain'd; 
Thy dog shall keep watch for another, 
Thy steed by another be reined. 
Tho' many now mourn for thee sadly, 
Soon joyous as ever they'll be; 
Thy bright orphan boy will laugh gladly, 
As he sits on some brave comrade's knee. 
But there's one who'll be true to her duty, 
Who will mourn for the lost and the brave, 
As when first in the bloom of her beauty, 
She Wept o'er her loved soldier's grave.

The aim of the author of " Dn W ITT'S CONNECTICUT COOK Bona " has 
been to strtp the art of cooking of all useless preparations, and all the un-
meaning jargon of the cuisine; and to write in a 
plain, common-sense way, 
giving only directions that have been tried and tug found wanting. 
Every 
mode of Cooking and Preserving described in these pages are the results of 
actual personal experience; and have never failed to produce the best tasting 
as well as the best looking dishes that can be placed on the table. 
Let any 
housewife follow the directions, and our word for it; Good digestion will 
surely " wait on appetite."

The Partizan's Oath: 
THE TROOPER'S REVENGE. 
No war for freedom was ever carried oil in which that 
noble goddess saw so little to deplore on the part of her 
votaries as in the glo6 us one of the American Revolution. 
Not one drop of blood was uselessly shed. 
It is this splen-
did epoch which this capital romance vitalizes. 
The bold, 
brave sons of liberty make the green woods ring with their 
rifle shots. 
The air seems tremulous with the booming of 
the bell of liberty. 
No one can read this work without 
being thrillingly interested in its striking pictures.
