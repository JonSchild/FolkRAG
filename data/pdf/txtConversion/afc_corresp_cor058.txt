[Letter from Alton C. Morris to Stetson Kennedy, July

July 10, 1940
Mr. Stetson Kennedy 1514 East Monroe Jacksonville, Fla
Dear Stetson:
I do not believe that we can use the drawings of the Nanigo street dance, even though I
am confident it would aid materially the appreciation of your article. The cost of drawings
of this kind is prohibitive. I feel, however, that your aricle is a colorful one as it is and will
prove very interesting to our readers.
There is a matter which I should like to discuss with you concerning the duplicates of the
material which we collected jointly last summer. I am at present working on my dissertation
and find it absolutely imperative that I have this material within the shortest moment
possible. The records, after I receive them, will have to be sent to Columbia University,
where a musicologist will make a transcription of them. His work is at the present time held
up because of the absence of this material. You can readily see that unless I can get this
material right away I shall be unable to complete my work for the doctorate in the time
which has been allotted me by the University of Florida.
I shall, therefore, appreciate greatly your eliciting the aid of Dr. Corse in procuring these
duplicates at the earliest convenience.
With sincere regards to you and your good wife, I am,
Sincerely yours, Alton C. Morris
