Project Detail 
This project is supported by the Archie Green Fellowship of the American Folklife Center at the 
Library of Congress. 
The purpose of the Immigrant Women Artists Oral History Project is to examine the occupational 
folklife of first-generation immigrant women artists living in Oklahoma and the networks of 
support that allow them to pursue their vocations in a 
new environment. This series of interviews 
examines not only the cultural and occupational traditions that these artists nurture in straddling 
multiple cultural identities, but also the translation of an artist's occupational life between 
multiple cultural and physical spaces. 
Legal Status 
Scholarly use of the recordings and transcripts of the interview with Madihah Janjua is 
unrestricted. The interview agreement was signed on December 12, 2020.

About Madihah Janjua... 
Madihah Janjua grew up in a 
family focused on science/engineering and medicine with little 
exposure to art at home or in the all-girls school she attended in Pakistan. After high school, 
however, she enrolled in fashion school in Pakistan, learning to draw and discovering her real 
passion lay with fine art. Having made a 
previous trip to Oklahoma to visit her uncle, she 
returned a 
second time and earned a 
BFA at Oklahoma City University. Initially focused on 
realism, Janjua's style has gradually morphed into a 
more expressionistic and occasionally pop 
art treatment of feminist themes. In her hijab series, she draws parallels between the suppression 
of women in the West and East. Her explorations of the nude female body, pregnant or 
menstruating, as the sum total of a 
woman's identity draw strong emotional responses from her 
viewers. 
In this interview, Janjua describes how, despite her family's educational privilege, her housewife 
mother never got to use her degree in botany. She remembers reaching out to other Pakistani 
students while in college, but not being able to connect with them. Despite her warm reception 
from a 
small group of galleries and artists, she explains how her physical appearance, her fluency 
in English, and her biculturality have been a 
catch-22 for her career, discouraging galleries from 
actively promoting her as an immigrant woman artist because she doesn't seem "Pakistani 
enough."

This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder with the Oklahoma Oral History 
Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Today is December 12, 
2020, and this is a 
remote interview with Madihah Jar jua for the Library c 
f 
Congress' OcciApational Folkl fe Prcject funded by the Archie Green 
Fellowship. I'm in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Madihah, you're in Oklahoma City. 
We'll be talking about your work as an artist who's equally [fluent] in 
Pakistani and Western culture and how it rE jlects your hi-cultural identity. 
Where were you born, and where did you grow iAp? 
I 
was born in Malaysia. I 
was actually born in Kuala Lumpur at a 
university 
hospital. I 
was raised sort of between Pakistan and the United States. I 
spent 
[some] of my teenage years and young adulthood in the UK, so sort of all 
over, if you will. We moved [from Malaysia] when I 
was about two, we 
moved to Pakistan. That's where my parents are from. When I 
was six, I 
moved to the US for the first time. I 
was only here for a 
short time; then we 
decided to move back. My 
brothers decided to stay here, but I 
moved back 
to Pakistan with my mom. When I 
was ten, I 
moved back here again and 
enrolled in school, and I 
was living with my brothers. My mother decided I 
was too young to be living without [my] parents, so [I 
went back and forth 
over the years]. Then I 
decided that I 
would really like to be in one place for 
an extended time, at least, you know, go to school and make friends and be 
in one place instead of having to go back and forth because it was disrupting 
my social life, so I 
decided to finish high school in Pakistan. Then when I 
was eighteen, I 
decided I 
wanted to move somewhere where I 
didn't really 
know anyone and start from scratch, so I 
moved to the UK, and I 
was there 
for six years. Then ten years ago, I 
decided to move to Oklahoma to go back 
to college and figure out what I 
wanted to be when I 
grow up. I've been here 
since then.

Okay, well, that's a 
big chunk cf time, so we'll kind c 
f 
go back and talk 
about some things that happened. What was the attitude towards art in your 
parents' home? What did your parents do for a 
living, and then what was 
the attitude towards art in your home? 
My dad was a 
doctor, and he also taught postgraduate students. He was a 
PhD. [I 
come] from a 
very, very heavily academic background. My mom 
has a 
master's in botany. Art was not a 
priority in the house. It was looked at 
as frivolous, waste [of time]. There was no benefit of art in your career and 
you as a 
human being. There was just no benefit. It was considered 
entertainment at best, and so I 
really had no exposure to art. There was no 
discussion [about it]. We didn't have any art hanging on the walls. We ... had 
bare walls. I 
think the only thing we really had was a 
couple of pictures in 
our formal living room, and that was it. We had nothing else on the walls, 
except for mirrors maybe. Art was just not a 
huge priority in our family. A 
part of it is sort of the Southeast Asian culture. There are renowned artists in 
Pakistan where I 
grew up, but it was discussed abstractly as, "These are 
some great artists, but that's what they did. That's not what we do." 
(Laughter) 
So even in terms cf, like, I 
don't know, you know, when you're young and 
things catch your eye, whether it's like a 
pot or a 
rug or anything like that, 
you don't really necessarily have any aesthetic memories from your parents' 
home cf kind cf becoming aware cf the beauty cf something, because we 
don't have to dc fine art necessarily as, you know, like paintings on the wall, 
either, or something. 
Right. My mother definitely did not have a 
distinct style. We didn't grow up 
very well off, and so it was more what was affordable. Focus on aesthetics 
really didn't exist, so no, I 
didn't grow up with an appreciation for things 
around me. It was more looked at from a 
utilitarian purpose for the most part 
and a 
front so that it looked like we were doing well, when reality, [there] 
was a 
hodgepodge of things. When my parents lived in Malaysia, and they 
lived in other places prior to Malaysia outside of Pakistan, they did do well 
back then. They had accumulated things, and they held on to those things. 
[They used those as] a 
facade to show the world that, "We are well [ off] and 
are well traveled," but when it came to artistic expression, that just didn't 
exist in [any] style in our home. It didn't exist [in any form] of art [ either]. 
My mom is a 
very creative person, which is very unique to me. She's very 
resourceful. She knows how to upcycle things and make them useful, but 
that creativity did not have an aesthetic to it. It [only had] a 
utilitarian 
purpose. "How can I 
upcycle or recycle something so that we can utilize it 
without throwing it in the trash," but not from a, "Is this beautiful? Is this 
5 
something that I 
admire when I 
look at? Does this inspire me?" That was 
really not the priority.

[00:07:28] 
Little Thunder 
Janjua 
So when you first came to Oklahoma, your first trip to the US, that is, am I 
right that you came to Oklahoma when you were around 
five, that first trip? 
Yeah, so the first trip, I 
was six years old. We actually went to California 
first. We were there for a 
little bit, and then we came to Oklahoma. I 
have 
uncles here in the US, so we stayed with them. I 
remember going to school 
very briefly in California.... When we went to Oklahoma, I 
did not enroll in 
school because my mother decided at that point she was going to take me 
back. She did not want to have me here. My uncle at that point had just been 
laid off. She did not want to be a 
burden on him, especially since my 
brothers were going to stay here. My aunt's actually a 
schoolteacher, so I 
did shadow her. I 
did see the culture in schools at that young age, even 
though eventually I 
would enroll in school here when I [would come back in 
a 
few years]. I 
did get to experience some of that culture, learn the 
differences, and learn just how different the academia is, the setup is in the 
US versus in Pakistan. 
What are some c 
f 
those d,.; ferences? 
... Back home, the education standard is a 
lot higher, and I 
don't 
[necessarily] mean that in a 
negative way. It's just that the [curriculum] in 
Pakistan and the education system's a 
little bit different. Like [in the US we 
go by freshman, sophomore, senior, etc., but in Pakistan we go by grades.] 
The things I 
learned in sixth grade were things you learn here in high school. 
I 
did notice that there was—school felt easier here, but at the same time, I 
had to learn about US history that [was all new to me]. There's also 
religious studies [(Islam)] that you have to be enrolled in just because that's 
part of your curriculum back home. Actually, I 
went to private schools back 
home, so I 
was in an all-girls Catholic school. (Laughs) I 
was taught by 
nuns, and so I 
had the best education I 
could've possibly had.... I 
do think 
that prepared me from an academic standpoint. [But] within those 
environments, art is not encouraged, and it's not about creativity. It's really 
about how well you can memorize things, how well you.... Critical thinking 
is not a 
big part of it, versus here in the US. At least at a 
younger age you're 
[encouraged to think critically]. 
When you're testing, it's more about what you're understanding, versus how 
well you can memorize something, versus back home, it was all about, "Can 
you memorize this poem word for word and then do a 
detailed description 
6 
and basically write down the equivalent of a 
small thesis about those 
poems?" You [also] had to learn a 
regional language. We spoke multiple 
languages. We spoke English, Urdu which is the national language [of] 
Pakistan. Then there's regional languages, because the province I 
grew up 
in, you had to at least take [the relevant] regional language. The big 
difference was having to learn the multiple languages. Even though I 
was 
not great at it, it was a 
requirement [along with] having the religious [studies 
while] going to an all-girls Catholic school, and then just the education 
standard of it being so much tougher back home. Math was so much harder. 
Geography was so much harder. We focused more on world geography, 
versus in the US, it was more just American geography and very high level 
of, "This is what the rest of the world looks like." History [back home] 
covered world history. It didn't just cover history of Pakistan. Those were 
some critical... differences that I 
identified pretty early on. 
[00:10:16] 
Little Thunder 
Janjua 
[00:12:31] 
Okay.... So on your second trip to Oklahoma, you're a 
little bit older now. 
I'm wondering fy ou had any encounters either with public art or maybe art 
someplace that you saw that sort c 
f 
got you thinking a 
little bit more about 
art. 
Probably not in a 
direct sense. I 
went to Lawton, and so it was a 
very small 
school. I 
was the only Pakistani girl. You know, it was such a 
different 
culture. The school that I 
went to in Pakistan was very militant in a 
way, 
versus when I 
was living in the US, you don't wear uniforms. There's not 
really a 
requirement of your nails being short and your hair being [worn] in 
a 
certain way. That gave me a 
freedom that I 
had never quite encountered in 
a 
school before. It... definitely made me feel more creative than I 
had ever 
encountered before. I 
think my parents would say it made me more 
rebellious when I 
returned because I 
had encountered a 
level of freedom I 
had never [experienced] in a 
school environment. I 
don't recall much 
creativity, but I 
recall more social aspects that I 
just wasn't exposed to back 
home. I 
went to a 
prom.... That's not something that we grew up with. I 
know the schools now back home definitely have proms, and the culture has 
changed. Back when I 
was growing up, we didn't have that. Just seeing the 
clothes and the colors and the lights, it just exposed me to a 
whole new 
culture, and it taught me that things don't have to be so structured and 
regimented. I 
think that was probably the start of something for me. It took a 
few years before that evolved into me having any exposure to art and 
actually appreciating it. 
Little Thunder 
Well, you did kind cf change direction in terms cf the way you thought about 
a 
career lifter you were in high school, I 
understand, back home. What 
7 
influenced that change, and what decision did you make about where you 
wanted to go to further your education? 
Janjua 
[00:15:35] 
So when I 
was in high school, when I 
was close to graduating, you know, 
everyone I 
knew had a 
plan. They knew what they wanted to be. They knew 
what they wanted to do. My 
parents wanted me to be a 
doctor because that 
was what you did. Both my brothers are engineers. They were like, "Okay, 
so that means you'll be the doctor. Someone has to go into the medical 
field." (Laughs) I 
absolutely did not want to do that, but I 
didn't know what 
I 
wanted to do. I 
felt very lost because you're taught at such a 
young age 
that you already should have a 
plan.... Before you even get to high school, 
you should have a 
plan, and our education system back home is definitely 
built that way. By sixth grade, you have to decide what your major is going 
to be, which meant you either chose science... economics, or... art. I 
did not 
do well in [the science] courses. I 
opted for art, but art is not the same as art 
in the US. It just meant I 
took a 
lot of accounting... statistics, and economics, 
and that was considered, I 
guess, a 
lower level than a 
science or biology 
course. 
Then when I 
graduated ... my parents kind of asked me, "What do you want 
to do?" They assumed I 
was going to be ready to enroll in university and I 
had a 
plan. They were like, "Well, you can't go to med school because you 
opted for art. You're stuck because you didn't take the right courses in high 
school." A 
close friend of mine at the time decided she was going to go to 
fashion school. I 
said, " Sure, this makes sense. I'll be close to a 
friend." 
(Laughs) You know, I 
was a 
rebellious teenager at that point. I 
knew this 
would probably upset my parents, and so that was the path I 
took. Fashion 
school exposed me to a 
whole new world. The clothes were not the most 
exciting part. The designing was not the exciting part. It was the first time I 
was introduced to drawing... painting, and printmaking. I 
was exposed to 
renowned artists in Pakistan, and that's something I 
just never encountered 
firsthand. I 
still have sketches from my very first semester, and they are just 
awful and funny because they are stick figures because I [had] no concept of 
the human figure. 
Within a 
year, it's night and day because it was the only thing that I 
truly 
just delved into, and it sucked me in in a 
way that nothing else had in my 
entire life. I 
found myself wanting to explore that realm more and more and 
understand and learn techniques, and at that point it was just techniques, 
right? I 
didn't have the intelligence to understand art is more than just the 
techniques and what you can do with it. It's an entire language in itself. I 
was just so fascinated that that really was the starting point for me that said, 
"Okay, now I 
know what I 
want to do. This is a 
path. It's not clear where 
this will go down the line, but I 
know that this is the path I 
want to take 
8 
moving forward. I 
want to learn more." I 
was in fashion school for a 
year 
and a 
half. Then I 
decided I 
don't really like the fashion industry and that's 
not what I 
want to do, so I 
dropped out. I 
decided I 
needed to take a 
moment 
and pause and really assess myself as a 
human being. 
I 
was eighteen [when I 
dropped out]. Every decision I 
had made in my life 
was based on what I 
had been raised with, what you're taught to think, 
versus what I 
should be thinking. I 
think art really made me realize that if 
this whole new experience that I'd never encountered in my life could make 
me feel this way, what are other things that I 
have not encountered because I 
just wasn't exposed to them? So I 
chose to move to the UK because I 
didn't 
have [any family there]. It would be completely turning a 
new leaf. No one 
would support me. I 
would have to figure it out on my own, and I 
knew 
there was a 
ton of great art in the UK 
that I 
could go explore. Living in the 
UK as an eighteen-year-old with no money is really hard, but it definitely 
helped me. It helped shape me as a 
person, and that's really where I 
think so 
much changed for me in my life at that point. 
[00:17:55] 
Little Thunder 
Janjua 
[00:18:58] 
Little Thunder 
Janjua 
So it was kind cf hard to go to a 
museum or go see whatever, money-wise, as 
I'm understanding you, but you did manage to go a 
few places. 
Yes, I 
would make it a 
point to go to museums and explore, but I 
just didn't 
have the comprehension that I 
needed. I 
mean, I 
studied art history in 
college, but it was so new that I 
just didn't have the intelligence and really 
the knowledge because information is one thing, but that information 
evolving into knowledge is a 
whole different thing. It wasn't knowledge for 
me yet. I 
didn't know how to quite process it, but I 
knew I 
enjoyed it. I 
knew 
that it was a 
place I 
felt the most comfortable, I 
felt the happiest, and I 
wanted more. It was sort of like a 
thirst. I 
was insatiable about it. It was a 
starting point where I 
knew, "I 
want to do something with this, but I 
don't 
know what." 
So how did you end iAp back in Oklahoma then? 
So after six years of being in the UK, I 
decided, "I 
think it's time to go back 
to college," because at that point I 
realized that I'd done all the traveling I 
wanted to do. I'd had a 
great time, but I 
really needed to focus on my future. 
I 
have a 
brother that lives here, so I 
figured I'd come here and go to college 
and take it from there. When I 
moved here ... I 
did an inventory of my skill 
set [and] of what I 
like to do. Really, it always ended up being, "I 
want to do 
something in art." I 
continued to draw while I 
was in the UK. I 
continued to 
paint and focus on that aspect, so I 
felt like it was a 
good starting point and it 
9 
was probably a 
smarter decision. I [enrolled in] a 
community college, and I 
decided to just get a 
visual arts degree [just to see where this can take me]. 
Now I'm actually learning about art history, [and] some of that information 
is solidifying into knowledge for me. That further reiterated to me that this is 
really what ... speaks to my soul. It brings my heart joy. Now I'm learning 
more [only] to realize it's more than just [ a] skill set. There's more you can 
do with it. You can spend your entire life dedicated to it, and you can never 
stop learning. That just added to the excitement of it. That really solidified 
to me that this is the path that I 
really want to take. Then I 
ended up going to 
Oklahoma City University. I 
graduated with a 
bachelor's in fine arts and a 
minor in art history. It really was the best time of my life. I 
learned and 
evolved as a 
human being, as an artist. My 
skill set expanded, but also my 
work evolved in ways that I 
never thought was possible. 
[00:21:09] 
Little Thunder 
Can you explain a 
little bit in what ways you felt like your work kind cf 
moved 
forward? 
Janjua 
Of course. It kind of goes back to my upbringing of we were ... taught skill in 
a 
more traditional sense, right? When I [think of] my parents, if they look at 
art, they look at how close to realism you are. There's no [consideration for] 
abstract because that's... looked at as you're not good enough. It's 
[considered] as child's play, as opposed to you're not confined by the rules 
of what someone who thinks they know [what] art is.... I 
think I [started] 
from that mentality. I 
didn't realize this early on in my career, but I 
did 
realize further down that I 
focused a 
lot on technique early on. All I 
wanted 
to do was be the best at what I 
was doing. I 
focused so much on 
technique... on realism. Then I 
kind of moved into things a 
little 
more... abstract... trying to kind of get away from [just techniques]. I 
noticed 
the more I 
moved away from it, the less it became about just a ... skill set, the 
more it became about what I 
was trying to say. 
Then it... evolved into, "What am I 
trying to say? What is the purpose here," 
because being able to be an artist is a 
privilege in itself. You have the power 
to communicate across languages. That's a 
barrier that most of us would kill 
to surpass. Once that realization occurred, my work evolved, and it moved 
away from this focus on realism. I 
could only speak about things I 
knew. Of 
course, the concepts that I 
was trying to explore, they also evolved [over 
time]. Initially, I 
was, I 
don't want to say angry, but definitely I 
had some 
internalized resentment of just my upbringing and the culture back home, 
and how I 
felt that I 
was robbed of the opportunity to learn this early on in 
life and see where I 
would have been further down. Maybe if I 
had that skill 
set earlier on, I 
would have been further on in life, I 
suppose, so some of that 
10 
anger and resentment showed in my work. Then as I 
worked through those 
feelings, I 
realized that everything happens for a 
reason.... 
After a 
certain point in your life, you have to take responsibility for your 
own behavior and your own actions. You can't use your past as a 
crutch and 
say, "This is what's defining me," because you have the power to define 
yourself. So my work started [changing], as well.... I 
did this hijab series 
for a 
long time. A 
lot of what I 
focused on was around feminism as a 
whole, 
women as a 
whole. The thing I 
could identify with most was not just the 
objectification of women but also just the fact that women are treated as 
background noise. That was really where the core concept was.... I 
did this 
series that I 
focused on for many years, and I 
did multiple concepts under 
the hijab series. A 
hijab, which is, you know, a 
religious covering that 
women wear, my approach to hijab is not to take away from the fact that 
some women wear hijab and it liberates them, while for some it has the 
opposite effect. 
[00:25:10] 
I 
was looking at it from [my perspective] growing up, watching women who 
were forced to cover themselves up because they were taught their bodies 
were sinful. Especially from young age, children, young girls who were 
barely five or six were starting to be told that, "You need to start covering 
yourself, and you need to be timid and coy. You need to be contained 
because your existence in some ways is a 
sin." Even though my mother 
didn't feel that way, I 
saw it so much around [me. I] saw it within the 
community. I 
saw it within the culture. That's really something that always 
negatively impacted me because I 
realized that I 
could never live by myself 
back home because I 
would always be scrutinized for it. A 
woman's 
successes are always brushed aside because the idea is, "What is the point? 
Why go to college? Why be successful? You're going to get married 
anyway and have children." That's really your identity. Your only identity is 
that you're meant to be a 
wife, [a 
vessel]; you're a 
mother. I 
held onto a 
lot 
of that. 
That was something that really stayed with me because my mother [fit that 
mold]. She [has] a 
master's in botany, but my dad did not really want her to 
work, so she didn't work. She was a 
housewife, and I 
knew she was 
resentful of it because he was successful and she wasn't.... All the years of 
college and hard work didn't mean anything. It was just a 
piece of paper at 
the end of the day. I 
think that her anger sort of transitioned into me. I 
really 
wanted to focus on women. A 
lot of that was also just me processing it and 
figuring out what that meant to me. Then when I 
moved to the US, there 
[was] just this assumption that [it] would not [be the same] here. It's all 
about equality; women are equal to men. You're just as liberated here as 
men are. [Then came] the realization that the discrepancies in the way 
11 
women are treated here exist, but it's a 
lot more nuanced. It's almost 
conniving, and ... there's layers to it. You don't realize it until you actually 
take a 
step back and really look as an outsider looking in. I 
think that it 
made sense to ... talk about [it]. 
The hijabs here still made sense to me because while it was me talking about 
my background living in Pakistan, it was not just that. It was also talking 
about what I 
was encountering here. It was almost a 
cathartic transformation 
to say it out loud that it's not just back home. Yes, it's more in your face and 
confrontational in Pakistan [or] Southeast Asia and non-Western countries, 
but it's also very much prevalent here in the West. It's just cloaked... better. 
It's dressed up. It's, you know, lipstick on a 
pig essentially is how we 
present it. It's still very much an issue here, and sexism is very much an 
issue here, amongst other things, of course. I 
really focused on one thing 
because this was ... me trying to [connect] the two cultures that I 
had been a 
part of, trying to identify my Eastern heritage with the Western influence 
that I 
had been in because, I 
mean, at this point, I've been [immersed] in 
both cultures. I've been in the West probably longer than I've been in the 
East at this point and trying to combine those two to find my own voice in 
the process.

So I 
think that's kind c 
f 
a 
nice segue into something that you spoke about, 
which was sort c 
f 
being judged as an artist, the way that dress and 
appearance, for example, played into you identfying as a 
bicultural artist 
but sort cf not quite fitting into the box that people imposed on you as being 
an artist who, you know, had immigrated from Pakistan here. Can you talk a 
little bit about those kinds cf stereotypes and sort cf, I 
don't know, boxes 
that people are trying to fit immigrant women artists into sometimes? 
Absolutely.... I 
was raised with English as my first language. Because I 
went back and forth, I 
didn't really have a 
strong accent, and I 
spoke English 
fluently.... I'm 100 percent an immigrant woman. I'm not a 
first-generation 
Pakistani American. I 
am an immigrant; I'm naturalized US citizen. That's 
something that most people really struggle with, so when I 
would do shows, 
the first thing I 
would get is, "Oh, you don't look Pakistani," and, "You 
don't sound Pakistani." There was this level of disappointment I 
would 
always identify in their voice. Then they would almost question, "So are you 
mixed, or...." Then they would [ask], "Oh, are you second generation? Are 
you first?" They looked at me as not being Pakistani enough because I 
didn't fit into the stereotype when you think of a 
Pakistani artist. I'm 
supposed to have a 
strong accent. I'm supposed to be darker. I'm supposed 
to have the features that make me look [more] Southeast Asian, [as per their 
standards]. That's not accurate because I 
am Southeast Asian. My 
parents 
12 
are Southeast Asian. I'm not mixed, and we have a 
lot of diversity within 
Pakistan and within Southeast Asia as a 
whole.... 
I 
did notice that [when] I 
looked at other artists, other Southeast Asian 
artists, that were a 
lot more successful because they did sort of fit those 
boxes because they looked like they were more Southeast Asian. They had 
an accent.... There's this fetishization, if you will, of [being foreign and 
being labeled as] exotic. I 
have noticed that when people don't know me, 
[after] I've done artist talks, I've had people come up to me and say, "You 
don't sound like a 
Southeast Asian. You don't even like express yourself 
like a 
Southeast Asian woman. You very much feel like a 
local, but you 
bring this sort of background, and obviously your point of view is different." 
I 
think they struggle with that because, again, I 
don't fit this box that they've 
created and the stereotypes.... I 
think that has impacted me career-wise 
because if you fetishize a 
culture or an identity [and] if you're paying for an 
experience and that's not what you're getting because that's what your 
expectation is, you're not really [going to be] interested in investing in it 
further. 
That's kind of what I 
identified was really the issue for me. I 
just wouldn't 
fall into that box, and so once I 
realized that, it definitely made me take a 
step back. I 
was less likely to do shows just because of that. I 
didn't want to 
do artist talks because I 
got tired of the [same responses]. I 
mean, the 
amount of times I 
got asked, "Are you first generation? Are you second? 
Are you mixed?" I 
mean, it is offensive to me at this point because it says 
that I 
don't fit your box of what you identify my race as. That, after a 
while, 
just got exhausting, and it definitely made me take a 
step back from wanting 
to do any artist talks anymore. It's harder to sell, as well, is what I've 
learned just with galleries. Larger galleries, if they're claiming someone is a 
Pakistani artist, they're less likely to pick someone like me. They're going to 
pick someone that looks and sounds more Pakistani than me, and that's not 
ideal, unfortunately.

Can you talk a 
little bit about—and that is one facet that you ran into with 
the some c 
f 
the Oklahoma galleries. Can you talk about some other aspects 
c 
f 
the Oklahoma art scene? What struck you when you initially were doing 
gallery shows and, you know, meeting other artists and having the 
opportunity to express yoursef through your art? What was your impression 
cf the Oklahoma gallery scene? 
I 
think it's a 
little bit cliquey. I 
mean, I've met some great artists. I 
do want 
to clarify this. I've met some great people that were very supportive and 
encouraging. As a 
whole, I 
did identify that the Oklahoma art scene as a 
whole and the galleries themselves, they tend to focus on specific artists and 
13 
because that's a 
brand. You're not selling the art. You're selling the brand. I 
understand that. That's kind of part of this world, but the brand that they're 
selling.... [For example], if you do Western art or you do [caricatures] or 
whatever your style is, it's coming with the brand. I 
didn't really fit into 
that. I 
mean, my work did, but I 
didn't fit into that. I 
did notice that when 
they tried to sell my work, they focused more on the work and less on me as 
an artist because it's harder to sell someone when, I 
guess, I 
sound like 
everyone else, even though I 
have different experiences and I've lived on 
different continents and I 
am....

Little Thunder

[00:38:22] 
A 
global citizen. 
Right. I'm an immigrant woman living in Oklahoma. It was harder for them 
to sell me, and unless you fit sort of that clique, it's harder.... Living in 
Oklahoma... you [have] to know the right people to be able to really bolster 
yourself and your work. Otherwise you wouldn't get the momentum that 
you needed. I 
know some fabulous artists that had the same issues that I 
did 
because they just weren't great at the persona that sells a 
specific type of art. 
You have to have a 
brand, a 
very clear, defined brand, and that brand needs 
to align with the gallery that's trying to sell you. Galleries love selling [a 
brand with a] focus on minority art ... whether it's indigenous art or 
immigrants, but that also has to come with a 
brand. Whether that means you 
look a 
certain way, sound a 
certain way, dress a 
certain way, it has to come 
with the brand. I 
don't necessarily fit that mold, and so it made it harder to 
sell me. I've had the luxury of working with some great galleries in 
Oklahoma, and I've had some wonderful opportunities, but long term it's 
just not sustainable because they're not going to prioritize me just from the 
fact that I 
don't have the brand that they would like to sell. 
How about your experiences with museums, or have you had many cf those? 
What's been the reception from museum people? 
I 
have not had any, and it's just because I 
haven't made the effort. My focus 
was just on art galleries as a 
whole, and I 
didn't feel like I 
was ready to 
progress to the level of reaching out to museums and have those 
conversations. There was no effort made on my part, so I 
can't fault them 
for not having any communication with me. (Laughter)

Have there been any other networks that have been important to you? How 
about other immigrant women artists or just d,.) ferent communities 
throughout Oklahoma that might be, I 
don't know.... 
Even within immigrant women, I 
don't know a 
lot of Pakistani artists. I 
did 
make an effort when I 
was in college specifically. I 
tried to reach out to 
other immigrant artists, especially Pakistani artists, and I 
got almost no 
response. It was just crickets on their end, and I 
understand. As an artist, the 
job never ends, and it's a 
very busy life. I 
do totally—I'm cognizant of that. 
I 
did not find a 
lot of support within that, and I 
don't fault them for that. I 
do 
have artists that had supported me here and that would recommend me for 
shows or reach out to me if there were opportunities. There are artists here 
that are absolutely wonderful and do provide the support that's needed. It's a 
small, small group, a 
small community of people that do that, that don't look 
at other artists as competition, which is something that I 
didn't quite 
[anticipate]. I 
was surprised that that sort of culture and mentality is that it's 
a 
competition when really it's not. We all have our different voices. We all 
have different messages. We have different styles and work. It's not a 
competition. We all support—your work will always speak for itself. 
There's a 
small group that thinks like I 
do, and they always, you know, 
provided that support and, like I 
said, would reach out with opportunities. I 
did have that for a 
long time, as well. 
What was one c 
f 
your more memorable shows? 
This was a 
show I 
did for [Artspace at] Untitled, and I 
did the artist talk for 
them. It was still part of the hijab series, but this was not the final [work]. 
This was just these [individual] women on their own. Most of the hijab 
series I've done, especially at the [end] of the series, became more about 
groups of women versus just individuals. When I 
did the show at Untitled, it 
was about individual women. I 
think that show was important to me because 
at that point I 
didn't realize it, but later down the line, it occurred to me that 
it was more about me as a 
person. I 
was exploring my own identity when I 
was [working] on that show, and sort of the isolation that comes from being 
an immigrant woman in Oklahoma, struggling with the identity issues that I 
have, not fitting into that mold. That's really when I 
identified a 
lot of these 
long-term career obstacles that my identity has caused. 
That show became ... a 
memorable show in many ways. Like I 
said, so many 
people reached out. They were just surprised to hear my side of the story 
and hear my experience and my focus on why I 
wanted to even do the series, 
the hijab series, and sort of discussing the oppression of women as a 
whole, 
globally, and the support that came from that it. Yes, there were parts of it 
where, like I 
said, people [expressed], "You don't sound Pakistani," and all 
15 
that, but there was also a 
ton of support within that, as well. It was just a 
very memorable show from the fact that I 
was more focused on myself as a 
woman, versus just my experiences and what I 
was representing and my 
work on behalf of other women I 
had encountered. That was life-changing 
for me. 
[00:42:45] 
Little Thunder

You mentioned where the show took place. 
Oh, Untitled, it's a 
gallery close to downtown in Oklahoma City. 
Okay, Oklahoma City, yeah. Well, I 
just love some cf the pieces I've seen cf 
yours, of course all online. Can you talk a 
little bit about your figurative 
paintings cf women and your nudes? Are you working in—what media are 
you working in? I 
just love the sculpturality cf even your paintings, actually. 
They have a 
bit cf that feeling. 
Right. So when I 
started the series, I 
initially focused on just the female 
figure, but I 
really tried to strip them of their identity because that's what the 
focus was, that, you know, your identity is just the fact that you're a 
woman. 
It's not who you are. It's not what you believe in. It's not your loves and 
your likes and your dislikes. I 
did these figures, and initially I 
started with 
these very rudimentary... mixed media paintings. Then I 
focused on 
sculptures where it was sort of a 
determination of, "What is the least amount 
of information I 
can provide to define that these are women without giving 
anything else, still [eluding] the fact that they are hijabis?" As I 
did these 
black sculptures and I 
produced about two hundred of these figures, they 
were really meant to be displayed outside. I 
laid them out in a ... park-like 
environment and ... on top of a 
hill. [When] you saw them from a 
distance, 
and you just saw black figures that looked like they were wrapped and they 
were bound.... 
What I 
was trying to do, again, was to focus on the fact that, one, minimal 
information that defines them as women; two, to kind of express what it 
feels like to be these women. Where you are bound, your identity is stripped 
from you, and you're given an identity: your female figure is your identity. 
Your femininity is your identity. You're a 
mother. I 
think when I 
finished 
that piece and I 
moved to the larger paintings where I 
started doing groups 
of women and made them even more abstracted and stripped them more of 
their features, it kind of evolved from the figures... and sculptures 
themselves. It was less about them being bound but also the fact that they 
were supposed to just be mothers. In the figures, they're either pregnant or 
they're menstruating because those are all things that define a 
woman. 
Reproductive organs at that point is just what's defining her, and that's 
really what I 
wanted to focus on. This is what a 
woman means just globally. 
16 
Initially when I 
did the sculptural series, it was more focused on women 
where I 
grew up, women that wore the hijab in poor communities where 
they're completely stripped of any choice. 
The choices are given to them, and they're taught, "Those are your choices. 
That's the choice you're making even though we're handing them to you." 
When I 
focused [on] the larger mixed media [paintings, I 
was also 
addressing the] women here in the United States [so] the hijab was 
irrelevant. The same struggles are within the Western world that we identify 
in the Eastern.... These women here, they're expected that you're going to 
be a 
mom and that's your identity. If you're not a 
mother, somehow you 
failed as a 
woman. I 
just wanted to reiterate that because it became more 
real to me as I'm getting older and I'm a 
woman living in the US. It drove 
the point home that you're not free of that level of oppression, no matter 
where you live. You think you're free, but you're not. It's still something 
that you take with you wherever you are. Unless larger changes don't 
happen, we're always going to live in this sort of cloaked but very oppressed 
world. 
[00:47:28] 
Little Thunder 
Janjua 
Yeah, I 
think that comes through really beaut fully. Are there some you've 
talked a 
bit about some c 
f 
the disadvantages, but are there some advantages 
to your biculturality in art? 
Absolutely.... I 
definitely look at my experiences as a 
privilege. Every day 
I 
look at—the fact that I 
grew up in so many different environments gave me 
a 
perspective that most people will never encounter. It makes me definitely a 
lot more open minded to things. I 
make it a 
point to not surround myself in 
an echo chamber and ... to surround myself with people that do bring another 
perspective because I 
just have to understand why someone feels the way 
they do and how can I 
better understand them. I 
don't think I 
would have 
had that if I 
hadn't had the upbringing that I 
did. Even though I 
grew up in a 
very conservative society, my parents were fairly open minded, and even 
though we were not artistically inclined, my parents definitely taught me to 
think for myself. They did teach me critical thinking, having the exposure 
that I 
did and seeing poverty in a 
way that I'd never seen before. You think 
[of] poverty in the US, [but] I've seen poverty in a 
way that, I 
mean, we 
can't even comprehend here. 
Also seeing oppression in a 
way that most people [may] never encounter and 
thinking, of course, the general consensus is, "Oh, you're moving to the US. 
You're free of those restrictions, and you can be yourself and evolve [into] 
who you wish to be," [but] realizing that depends on who you are, where 
you're from. Are you privileged in some way, shape, or form, whether 
you're of a 
specific race or ... gender ... ? I 
think it definitely has made me a 
17 
lot more empathetic. I 
think that's really what coming from two different 
cultures does, is it makes you open minded. That open mindedness just 
makes you a 
lot more empathetic. Most people, they fail to experience 
[empathy] because if you've been shown one perspective your entire life, 
you lack the creativity to put yourself in someone else's shoes. It's one thing 
to try and do that, but that takes some serious creativity. I 
think that being 
bicultural has definitely given me these invaluable set of tools, [so] I 
consider myself very, very privileged. 
[00:50:26] 
Little Thunder 
What's the best compliments or one cf the compliments that stands out that 
you've received on your work? 
Janjua 
[00:53:01] 
When I 
did my capstone show in college, I 
had [multiple men reach out to 
me] when they saw the paintings in person because it's one thing to see the 
paintings in pictures [versus in real life].... Most said that, "I 
was surprised, 
yes," and say that they had an emotional response to the paintings. I 
wanted 
to create a 
line of communication, [and they really wanted to] understand 
because they could feel there was some turmoil but they wanted to [know] 
why. That is something that I 
can't put a 
price tag on. It's all I've ever 
wanted, is that line of communication to express why we feel the way we do 
and how can we change that. It made me realize that we do have this social 
responsibility in a 
way. Not every artist is required to do that, but I 
felt that 
there was a 
social responsibility, that I 
had a 
moral responsibility to have 
that communication with these people that were reaching out to me. 
It made me realize art is far more powerful than I 
had ever realized, and kind 
of going back to the privilege of being in the US and being able to explore 
this realm of art that I 
didn't even know I 
had access to or I 
could do and 
what I 
can do with it. I 
was able to communicate with someone that I'd 
never met in my life that walked into a 
gallery, looked at a 
piece of work, 
and then walked up to me and had a 
conversation about it, and expressed 
that they had an emotional response to it. That's something that will always 
be with me. It has definitely encouraged me and has made me more aware of 
my work, which is why I 
decided that any work, any other shows I 
do, it's 
important that that I 
am able to provoke some sort of response, if nothing 
else, that that response is simply a 
question. That's what I 
would like, is that 
someone looking at any work that they're viewing, [regardless of] if it's a 
show, even if it's online, [does] it [provoke] a 
question. Then I 
feel like I've 
done my 
job. 
Little Thunder 
Well, you mentioned that, you know, these past four years and some (f 
the 
legislation that's come out here in the US, and the social justice and racial 
18 
justice movements that have been forced I 
guess to just... precipitated by acts 
c 
f 
violence and other things that the Black Lives Matter movement and some 
cf these other things that have come to the foreground during the pandemic, 
and they've kind cf fueled your desire to maybe start doing some art again. I 
wonder f you can talk a 
little bit about that. 
Janjua 
[00:56:50] 
Absolutely. We kind of talked about just my evolution as an artist when I 
started was more about the technical aspect of it, and then that transitioning 
to what am I 
actually saying. With the hijab series, there was an evolution 
that happened to that series, as well. I 
focused on, in a 
way, a 
one-
dimensional subject. That evolved. I 
started looking at it not just from an 
Eastern perspective but from a 
Western perspective, as well. Then looking at 
the current political environment, it has definitely made me think, and I 
have 
been working on concepts of what I 
would like to focus on. Being an 
immigrant woman, there's these internal conversations I 
have about what 
it's like to be just in the professional world. When someone gets handed a 
resume with my name, I'm not going to be prioritized. I 
understand that. 
That's just how it is. I 
hate saying this this way because it's so unfortunate 
that I 
have to say this out loud, but I'm passing, which means someone who 
looks at me doesn't quite realize I 
am an immigrant woman or I'm Pakistani. 
They may think I'm Hispanic, but more than likely, most people feel like 
I'm mixed. I 
don't experience the kind of racism off the bat that someone 
that's not passing experiences, and that is a 
privilege. As much as it 
shouldn't be, it is. It's upsetting, and it's heartbreaking that that is 
the ... reality. I 
have experienced racism just because of my name. I 
have 
experienced people.... When I 
did a 
lot of the hijabi series, I 
think people 
thought I 
was something else. Then they talked to me, and they realized I 
hadn't just moved yesterday. With the Black Lives Matter movement, I 
mean, I 
was aware of the level of racism just as an immigrant woman, but I 
didn't realize the systemic and institutionalized racism that's so ingrained 
into people that they are completely blind. They just don't even have the 
ability to see how that system is benefiting someone that is not of color. It 
has driven me to really explore my work and kind of move away from [a 
single-faceted approach]. 
I 
mean, feminism is always going to be an issue, but we have to always 
focus on the house on fire first. I 
think that's something that has been on my 
mind. I 
have been working through certain concepts and trying to see how 
best I 
can have that conversation with people.... I 
can verbally have that 
conversation with people in my 
life. Through my work, I 
would [also] like 
to start having some of those conversations. If I 
can make someone think for 
one moment, I 
feel like there's some power in that, and so I 
would like to 
start focusing on that.... That's the next path I 
want to take, is really sort of 
19 
focus on just the plight of people of color as a 
whole and specifically for 
Black lives within the US because this is a 
Western country. The entire 
world is looking at us thinking, "This is the United States. We're a 
progressive, developed nation with liberal values, and we are progressive," 
and that is not the case. We're really behind times in so many ways. 
I 
see certain cultural parallels in the US that I 
saw growing up in Pakistan, 
and that really blows my mind. Caste system is really an unfortunate reality 
of Southeast Asia. To me, it's ... the absolute same concept. You give 
someone no tools to succeed and then criticize them for failing and then 
criminalize them and scrutinize them. It's a 
cruel reality, and it's deliberate, 
and it's political. While as people we can only do so much, it is really the 
responsibility of lawmakers and legislators and politicians to make those 
changes. We have to voice our—we have to say something because, you 
know, silence is complacency and we are a 
part of the problem then. I 
definitely want to focus on that in the next body of work that I 
work on. 
Feminism will still be part of that because, realistically, people of color, 
and... specifically women of color, are always going to suffer a 
little more 
just because we've got multiple things working against us, unfortunately.

Within every community. 
Correct. 
Have you thought about another state being more conducive to working full 
time as an artist? I 
mean, what keeps you in Oklahoma, aside from maybe 
practical, you know, practical reasons? (Laughter) 
I 
have thought about moving. I 
actually did not plan on staying in Oklahoma 
long term. I 
thought I'd graduate and move out. Then when I 
graduated, I 
just could not sustain myself as an artist. I 
just didn't have the right brands. I 
wasn't being able to sell shows the way I 
should have been selling. I 
have 
noticed, you know, the patrons that follow specific artists, they like to stick 
with the artists that they usually purchase from, and so I 
didn't have those 
dedicated patrons. I 
chose the non- art career as my day job, and so it's kind 
of hard to walk away from a 
career that offers benefits and insurance. I 
would like to move out of state if possible, but I 
think a 
lot of that is going 
to just be driven by if either I 
can find the right opportunity or I 
can keep my 
day job with remote capabilities and then move to a 
different state that has 
[more opportunities]. Oklahoma cost of living is lower. That meant as an 
artist that [is sustainable] .... Kind of why I 
decided to stay as long as I 
have 
is, I 
always assumed I'd have a 
day job and then continue working in the 
evenings as an artist and still keep focusing on projects, but it's just not 
20 
panned out the way that I 
was hoping for. Just economically, it's such a 
massive challenge. 
Yes, down the line if there was an opportunity, I 
absolutely would look into 
it. I 
have mixed feelings about that sometimes because I 
kind of talked about 
not being in an echo chamber. Being in Oklahoma, which is a 
very red state, 
if we can start having more of those conversations and sway even one 
person, I 
feel like there's purpose there. That's something that does stay 
with me, that I 
do think about [often]. It's sort of internal, like, back and 
forth of, "Is that worth staying?" (Laughs) ... You do because someone that 
doesn't realize that they live a 
life of privilege just because of something 
they were born with, even if they grew up in poverty, they have a 
level of 
privilege that they just have assigned to them at birth. If I 
can have them 
realize that privilege, then I 
think it might be worth being here and having 
those conversations, versus larger cities and more blue states where it is an 
echo chamber and a 
lot of people already know that. It's important to not be 
in that environment because you're just bullshitting yourself and everyone 
already agrees with you. You're not making a 
change. 
[01:03:24] 
Little Thunder 
Yeah, you're wanting to stay where the work can make a 
d,,) ference. 
Janjua 
Right. 
Little Thunder 
What has been, like, a 
highlight for you so far in your art career? 
Janjua 
Well, this. (Laughter) It has been really nice. 
Little Thunder 
I'm so glad because you've said some great things. 
Janjua 
Yeah, this interview kind of came out of the blue, and it's been a 
privilege. 
The fact to even be considered for something like this and to be part of [US] 
history in a 
way is flattering and encouraging. The fact that I'm an 
immigrant woman living in the US, I'm a 
Pakistani American, and that's 
being memorialized, there's weight to that. It's a 
good reminder of why I 
decided to go down this path to begin with. It's... [encouraging], and it's 
also a 
nudge of, "I 
need to keep doing this. I 
can't stop." 
[01:04:33] 
Little Thunder 
How c 
ften do you go home to Pakistan, well, where your parents live? 
(Laughter) You have two homes. 
Janjua 
Yeah, my mother still lives back home. I 
have actually not seen her in many, 
many years. I 
have not been back home in probably fifteen years. I 
would 
21 
like to go back at some point, but it's a 
very expensive trip and it's just one 
of those trips that you can't just hop on a 
plane. If I 
go, it'll be for at least a 
month. It's hard to do that with the day job and also trying to, you know, 
still work on art in the evenings and sustain myself as a 
human being. It's on 
my mind. It's something I 
absolutely want to do and need to do, but it's just 
a 
huge challenge, unfortunately, right now. 
[01:05:28] 
Little Thunder 
Thank goodness for telephones, anyway. 
Janjua 
Yes. (Laughter) We definitely speak a 
lot, yes. 
Little Thunder 
Well, I'm looking forward to keeping in touch with you and 
following your 
career. Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you'd like to add? 
Janjua 
I 
think we covered quite a 
bit. I 
think it's important that [I 
add a 
note for] 
any other person in my shoes that is trying to be a 
part of the art world. I 
[was at] a 
disadvantage because when I 
was growing up, we were taught that 
[art] was not a 
priority, so I 
also didn't have the fire behind me to keep 
going the way I 
should have. I 
think that it's [critical] because I've done that 
with my day job. I've continued and moved forward and progressed in that 
world, even though that's not the world that feeds my soul, and it's not the 
world that I 
feel like I'm making a 
difference. I 
really hope that anyone 
that's in my shoes or is in a 
similar situation understands that you've got to 
have that fire behind you to keep going because it is worth it. It absolutely 
is, not just for your own evolution and growth, and for the fact that you can 
make a 
difference, and you have something to say, and you can change the 
world in a 
small way. That's so powerful, and I 
really hope that people 
realize that, especially if someone's an immigrant or even if...they're just a 
minority. It's important to realize that. I 
definitely wasn't given that skill set 
growing up or [the] motivation for this, but it's definitely a 
journey. I 
definitely have to have those conversations with myself to keep going, but it 
is worth it. When I 
do shows [and] a 
piece... goes off [to a 
new home] and 
someone has a 
conversation with me about it.... 
To me it's fascinating that I've done pieces that I 
don't think about and 
someone has reached out to me years later [to talk] to me about it ... in detail. 
I 
may not have even put as much into that piece because I 
was in the 
moment and I 
was focused on a 
single facet, while it had a 
completely 
different effect on the person who's looking at it every day in their home, or 
they looked at it in the gallery [and projected] whatever the situation may be 
in. I 
think there's a 
kind of power in that that I 
can't quite describe because 
it gives it a 
sense of responsibility. It's not the kind of power that makes you 
feel, oh, you know, "I 
can do things." It's the kind of power that gives you a 
sense of [doing the right thing]. That's important, that whatever you do, 
there's good intent behind it. Maybe that intent is just working through your 
22 
own emotions and your own feelings, but there needs to be some sort of 
intent, and it needs to be ... deliberate to a 
certain extent. Even if it's not, 
understand that it's going to impact people. Just be aware of that. 
[01:09:06] 
Little Thunder 
All right, well, thank you so much for your time today, Madihah. 
Janjua 
Absolutely. Thank you so much for this opportunity. This was absolutely 
wonderful. This was a 
great conversation. 
Little Thunder 
I 
really er joyed it, too.
