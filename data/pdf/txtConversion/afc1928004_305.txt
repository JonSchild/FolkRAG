Old Adam was a 
hero, 
His like you'll never find, 
Although he was the first man, 
He was the last one of his kind ; 
For every sip that wet his lips 
Was pure cold water, sparkling free, 
An honest man, with an honest grip, 
Son of Temperance, S. 0. T. 
CHORUS. 
Then come and join the noble band, 
Humanity, salvation; 
Push along, sing the song, 
Set the whole world free. 
Help every man who walks the land 
To a 
proud and lofty station; 
Join hands all ye Sons 
Of Temperance, S. 0. T. 
Don't talk about your whiskey, 
To aggravate a 
man, 
Who's signed the temperance pledge, boys, 
And resolute I'll stand; 
The bowl defy until I 
die, 
To drink I'll Dever bend the knee, 
No blush or shame to mar the name— 
Son of Temperance, S. 0. T. 
Then come and join, Sz-c. 
The little birds that warble; 
So cheerful they sing, 
Just after sipping Adam's ale, 
From nature's lovely spring, 
While flowing from a 
mountain side, 
An example for the world to see. 
Take m advice and join the band,

RIGAN and HART.

Sweet Potteen, you deceiver, 
I 
love you just as well, 
Since the day when first I 
met you, 
You threw o'er me a 
spell; 
You're winning, you're enticing, 
As soft as Asia silk, 
I 
love you, oh my darling, 
As the baby loves its milk. 
CHORUS. 
Then drink to your neighbors, 
Drink to your friends, 
The dew from the mountain stream; 
It once you took a 
drop, 
Upon my soul you'd never stop, 
A 
drinking of the sweet potteen. 
Old B9.echus, you deluder, 
With all your coaxing ways, 
You've enslaved me liked a 
spider, 
When brought within my gaze; 
Wid whiskey I'm so frisky, 
From my head down to my toes, 
I'd praise you, oh my darling, 
To your friends or to your Les. 
Then drink to your, &c,

ED. HARRIGAN'S greatest Negro sketch of the age.

FISEIER, 93 Nassau Street, New York. 
'Twas down to Aunty Jacksons, 
Dar was a 
big reception, 
Of high toned aristocratic coons, 
Full of sweet affection; 
Such singing, and such dancing. 
We made de ceiling shake, 
But de cream of all de evening, 
Was walking for dat cake. 
CHORUS. 
Gentle on de toe, we darkies step out so 
Easy and so gracefully, around de room we go, 
Be wenches captivate, we all persumbulate, 
High toned colored people. 
A 
walking tor dat cake, 
All forward form, Oh, in de gay quadrille; 
liord! how we perspire, 
No use, we can't keep still; 
Stop de music do, oh do for goodness sake, 
I 
feel so shy, I'll really die, 
A 
walking for dat cake. 
Dar's Miss Clementina Brown, 
Oh ! did'nt she hug dc groom; 
Wid an alligator slipper shoe, 
Dat would cover half do town. 
You ought to see her gliding; 
Slic kept us all awake, 
Oh I

fashionable sliding der.

Dey fell into de washtub, 
A

Dere was major general Slocum, 
He was de ladies' choice, 
Be gemmen said for monstrous feet. 
Dat nuffin could he ware, 
Wid his military wheeling, 
Be prize he said he'd take, 
He busted through de ceiling,

DUFFY TO THE FRONT, 
HARRIGAN'S great- song, as sung in his play of "MALoNE'S 
NIGHT OFF." 
Copyright 1876, by A. J. FISHER, 98 Nassau Street, New York 
Cornelius Duffy, the people's choice, 
A 
substantial, solid man, 
Will represent our government. 
And surely lead the van; 
His head is full of learning, 
His constituents all agree, 
He'll hold the chair and rule it there. 
Far up in Albany. 
CHORUS. 
Then rise your voices every one, 
The enemy we will hunt, 
We'll rule New York, ah that's the talk, 
When Dufly's to the front. 
You can drink your lager on Sunday then, 
And speak your mind at will, 
You can fight all night, till broad day-light, 
The police can't keep you still; 
Your influence will be powerful, 
Led by a 
man of ability, 
When Cornelius Dufly's to the front, 
Far up in Albany. 
Cnoaus. 
So rise your voices every one, 
The enemy we must hunt, 
Let's draw our swords, and carry the ward, 
And put Duffy to the front. 
Oh Itahans then we'll have to go 
Way back to Italy, 
And live upon red herrings, bones, 
And maccaroni tea; 
The city must be clean and white, 
The cream ox gentility, 
When Duffy's to the front, my boys, 
Far up In Albany. 
So rise your voices every one, 
The enemy we must hunt, 
On election day we'll clear the way, 
And put Duffy to the front.

HELL GATE BUST UP. 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN, and 3ung by BILLY CARTER. 
Copyright 1876, by A. J. FISHER, ss Nassau Street, New York. 
Dar was a 
big explosion, 
Of a 
million old time rocks, 
ft killed a 
million suckers, 
A 
swimming around de dock; 
Oh nverything was shakey, 
it broke overy ' in mill's slate, 
When ten billion pounds of water 
Busted at 
gate; 
Move - '
ay from powder, 
it out for your late, 
Or '
twill send you up to glory, 
Dis busting of hell gate. 
Dutch went up with Irish, 
Republicans and Democrats; 
It killed every feline Thomas, 
And buried all the rats, 
It threw up old time dumplings, 
Cut up half the State, 
Sent Astoria up to Venus, 
Dis busting of hell gate; 
Vesuvius aint a 
maker, 
ranks arc sure to break, 
hove up all the Ocean, 
Dis busting of bell gate. 
All iovers seperated, 
Real Estate was high, 
Biggest kind of kicking, 
Way up in de sky ; 
Met Charley Ross up in de moon, 
You ought to see me skate, 
Got milk in de milkey way, 
Clear up above bell gate.

CONEY ISLE, 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
At lo German Saratoga, 
Way down at Coney Isle, 
I 
thought I'd go in swimming, 
Just for to see the style 
Of the different kinds of Mermaids, 
And hear them yell and screech, 
While flopping in the water, 
At Coney Island beach. 
There was ladies and babies, 
As happy as could be, 
Dutch tailors and Dutch brewers, 
A swimming in the sea. 
Dry goods clerks in bathing, 
Looking like a 
barber's pole; 
All de Dutch from Mackerelville, 
Like porpoise they did roll; 
The shop girls look like naaids, 
Floating from the shore, 
Young man newly married, 
Trying to drown his mother-in-law. 
There was drummers and bummers, 
As dirty as could be, 
Taking in their maiden wash, 
A swimming in the sea. 
All the biggest ponislaz..11, 
The fattest and the lean, 
All the water in the ocean 
Could'nt wash them clean. 
Barnum's big fat woman 
Swam our to a 
boat, 
All the buoys in the water 
Would'nt make her float. 
There were Hannahs and Johannahs, 
Maria's and Marie, 
Treading clams, the little lambs, 
While swimming in the sea. 
There was a 
lot of preachers, 
Who came horn Brooklyn town, 
Went in to wash their sins away, 
But wickedness wont go down; 
It floated like the garbage, 
And kept within their reach, 
There's a 
good deal from Brooklyn, 
Hangs heavy on the beach. 
There were ladies and babies, 
As happy as ean be, 
Eat chowder at Mike Norton's, 
After swimming in the sea.

DANCING IN THE BALLET'. 
Written and sung by En. H ARRIGAN. 
I 
was once the queen of the ballet so gay, 
The greatest artist ever seen on the stage; 
In the art Terpsichore, a 
sweet beauty in fact, 
I 
set the whole town in a 
rage. 
Engaged by Jarrett and Palmer each week, 
To do the solos in the Crook; 
I 
would fascinate your dears, 
With my loving, languishing look. 
CHORUS. 
Dancing in the ballet, 
The beautiful Parisian ballet, 
I 
was the queen, La belle Pauline, 
Dancing in the ballet. 
My name on the bills was Silvina Malki, 
My real name was Johannah McGee; 
So fluent I 
speak the French language, oh my, 
That's warbled in Tip- per-rare- e. 
The young men would call me a 
dazzler so sweet, 
Delightful, entrancing they'd say, 
2:ow I'm forced to make shirts for the supers I 
meet, 
Considered by all en passe. 
Dancing in the ballet, lc. 
I 
was so bewitchingly, graceful and neat, 
in slow movements Tny . overs, .ts there I 
exeell, 
Mountains of bouquets and flowers so sweet, 
Was thrown to this pretty gazelle. 
The young girls would say, what a 
beauty and sigh, 
As around on my toes I 
would spin; 
iD the back line of ballet, I'll stop till I 
die, 
Because I'm so dreadfully thin. 
Dancing in the ballet, Szc. 
When standing amidst the coryphees there, 
I 
make such a 
sweet-looking fairy-like queen' 
Could stand on the end of a 
needle, 
And turn or float in cloud in the air. 
My dresses were made and brought out from Paris, 
Most gorgeously trimmed round with gold; 
Now I'm in the back line of the ballet, 
Simply because I 
am old. 
Dancing in the ballet.

When love's afloat in Cupid's boat 
Its beauty's summer's dream. 
Gliding down the stream,

My joy you know is with my beau, 
When gliding down the stream. 
The stars we tried to count them, 
Bright shining over head, 
Sweet Venus kept a 
twinkling, 
'Twas then my Harry said— 
If you say yes when I 
propose, 
So nervous did he seem, 
The little stars kept urging me 
While gliding down the stream. 
Gliding down the stream, kc. 
Now all his conversation, 
While gazing at the moon, 
Was sweetest little darling 
Next Sunday aftenmon: 
I'm going to ask your mama 
To grant my life long dream; 
So we shall always side by side, 
Be gliding down the stream.

Price 35 cts. 
We marched behind the Branigan's band on the great St. 
Patrick's day, 
With fifes and drums, a playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh! we marched so gaily down the street, 
And every one we meet says don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's band. 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward march away I 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array, 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand. 
Like heroes bold, the young and old will march with the Bran-
igan's band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs, they're waving towels, to catch our soldiers 
eyes; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash, when the Mar-
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's band; 
Oh! don't their hearts go pit-a- pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, 
He's the daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, &c. 
Oh, we had a 
ball in Emteald Hall, and an illegant supper 
too,— 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat for 
you, 
With pickled stews, and hullabaloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets and cheese, and some potheeu for the boys of the Brant-
gang band; 
Oh! it's then we sung, and danced a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's band. 
Mark time, keep step, &c.

But soon he passed away ; 
And silence reigns around the place, 
Where things were once so gay.

To play upon the old banjo, 
At home in Alabam.

Then you should come and see us 
As we march down Broadway;

And then they beat retreat ; 
It's no use, boys, they give it up, 
They know we can't be beat!

E're my love for thee shall falter, 
Or my faith forgotten be; 
All things else on earth may alter, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee, &c. 
Joyfully when first I 
found thee, 
Bowed my soul at love's behest; 
Now when sorrows gather round me, 
Thou alone can'st make me blest, 
Be my heart thy throne for ever, 
Let all tears forgotten be; 
Weal or woe es-trange us never, 
Still I 
love thee, love but thee. 
What should make thee, &cc.

LATE TELEGRAM SONG. 
As Sung Originally by Mr. FRANK LEWIS. 
I 
am going to sing a 
little song, if you'll listen unto me, 
I 
have all the late dispatches that have come o'er land and sea: 
There are some will make you sob and cry, and others make you laugh 
The many funny messages sent through my telegraph. 
The Fenians have conquered Holland, old Turkey's taken sick; 
They've made an Indian Princess of our good old friend Queen Vic. 
They're impeaching gr. Belknap, because his Agents tried 
To find how long 'twould take to starve a 
soldier, ere he died. 
Dom Pedio's caught the measles from off the Prince of Wales; 
Ward Beecher has joined the Mormons, so quietness prevails. 
Fred Grant has killed old Sitting Bull, he's earned his monthly pay: 
He left his Pop in Washington, he couldn't stay away: 
The Italian nation have come o'er, they would rather work thanbeg ; 
They spend their time in emptying out each Dutchman's lager keg. 
Boss Tweed has been discovered, a 
strange thing you will say; 
He was shoveling garbage from the scows to fill up New York Bay, 
The working men are still crushed down beneath reformei's power; 
They manage just to starve themselves on 20 cents an hour. 
Prince Bismark has a 
Baby, he's now left in the lurch; 
The ladies sweet of Boston town, have bought the old South Church. 
Billy Wickham shaved his whiskers off, Dan Drew his debts has paid, 
Dr. Dix has learned the Can-Can along with Whitelaw Reid. 
Ben Butler's lost his larboard eye, so he can see no more; 
'Twas found in Mike Norton's chowder pot, on Coney Island shore. 
Harry Hill has joined the T A. B. ' s, along with Peter Dwyer; 
The cow has broken loose again that caused the Chicago fire. 
Count Johannes and Doctor Landis have got into a 
fight; 
As to se:: which of the two can play the ghost of Hamlet right. 
Sammy Viden soon will married be and have some babies born; 
He proposed to Susan Anthony, Tennie Claflin and Kate Thorn, 
Mr. Belzebub's arrived in town to visit uncle Sam; 
And what his busir-eas is I'll tell in my next Telegram. 
THE WASHINGTON BALL. 
Dedicated to my friend TOMMY TURNER, of the 3 
Turner Bros. 
AS 
Sung by FRANK LEWIS, originally, at Fox's American Thea-
tre, Philadelphia, with great success. 
A 
comical story I 
am going to tell you, 
And I 
know it will please if you listen to me. 
I 
attended a 
party in Washington City, 
And I'll mention a 
few of the sights I 
did see. 
was a 
Ball that was iven to Moody and Sankey, 
Of which Mayor Wickam the fign res dld call. 
Mysel f, Governor Tilden, and 13arnum's What s 
It, 
'We formed the first set, at the Washiigton Ball. 
We ah took c_ snifter when each dance was over, 
'Till getting excited, they quick came to blows. 
Tho British Ambassador went for Dora Pedro, 
And received for his trouble a 
bang on the nose. 
Mr. Senatoi Thurman, he then got entangled 
With sweet Mrs Tilton, while arranging her shawl; 
And our great Tony Pastor, he bursted his boiler. 
Too fat for to dance, at the Was'iington Ball. 
Vice President Ferry he then did get merry : 
He borrowed a 
dime from a 
fierce looking chap ; 
He said, from his stealings, he soon would repay • t. 
When an Agent he was made by Mr. Belknap. 
Tennie Claflin was seen squeezing Blair in the corner ; 
Mr. Beecher shed t 
ears as he kissed them all; 
Bessie Turner took a 
cocktail, she said 'twas to warm her, 
And that started the fight at the Washington Ball! 
Miss Kate Fields gave a 
Lecture on Nursing the Baby, 
She said Brigham Young was the best of them all; 
She grasped Lester Wallack by the tip of his whiskers, 
And she shook the black dye from hi_ monstacheaud all. 
The Congressmen, drunk, they lay under the table 
In a 
knot, tied together, both little and tall; 
Mr. Moody gave Sankey a 
kick in the stomach, 
Just to keep up the fun, at the Washington Ball 
COL Fred. Grant drew Hs sword for the first time in battle, 
He lobed when the fight -Its going to begin; 
He said many a 
scrimmage he had in Chicago, 
When he went there so boldly, his young wife to w:n. 
Boss Sheppard then ran in to stop all the fighting; 
Mrs. Marsh, she threatened to blow on them all. 
She arid she'd report them to the Smelling Committee! 
And that put an end to the Washington Ball.

Behold before you here to-night, two double-breasted inokes;

When we worked upon the levee, way down at New Orleans; 
We had some very happy times, and seen some j 
oyorts scenes, 
We used to juggle cotton bales, upon the steamer's decks, 
And when the work was over, why, ' tis then we'd feel 
Par Ex. 
If you watch, &c. 
But perhaps we are intruding, upon you're precious time, 
It so don't be ofle tied, nor consider it a 
crime; 
For we always labor hard to please, and do not wish to vex, 
So we leave It to your judgment, if these coons are not

And be with hope content; 
While marching on to victory, 
In the Irish regiment!

Acrooss the raging sea;

am, an Irishman, 
And to work I'm not afraid; 
While my son does carry the Pick, my boys, 
And I

There's a

And it points direct 4o 
me ; 
How the little spark is shining, 
From whomever can it be ? 
It gets brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray ; 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CHORUS. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me; 
And send a 
loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your helms on me; 
And speed the loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me, 
Oh ! superstitious dread, 
How many idle fancies, 
You conjure in my head ; 
When those we love are absent, 
How wantonly you play; 
Every shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark, &c. 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months, no more, 
Since a 
letter in the candle, 
Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger, 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the same, 
How welcome it shall be.

SALLY BLESS MY SOUL. 
new song of " The Great Two," DPCSKANTY & CUM-
MINGS. 
I'd like to know the reason why, 
As I 
go down the street 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet; 
I 
asked my cousin Sally once, 
Why it was they smiled so sweet? 
She says, you are a 
perfect dunce, 
'They are laughing at your feet. 
CHORUS. 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief, 
My anguish to control, 
And said, when I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh! Sally Bless my Soul.. 
Of all the talents I 
possess, 
These feet they are my pride ; 
They are good sized, and cost me less 
To walk with, than to ride; 
They always take/ me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go; 
But Sally filled me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
I 
blushed, Arc. 
Now, I've resolved to search this town 
For smaller shoes to try; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer by; 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
vow, 
And dress up in thg style ; 
And when I 
meet my 
-love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile. 
CHORUS. 
Then joy will take the place of grief, 
My anguish I'll control, 
And sing, 'till I 
get out of breath, 
Oh! Sally Bless my Soul.

Close the shutters—Willie's dead, 
Whom we loved so dear— 
Like a 
dream his spirit fled 
From our home, now sad and drear; 
When the spring-time flowers were blooming, 
And the happy birds sung sweet, 
Angels called him to their home, 
Up in Heaven where we shall meet. 
CHORUS. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead; 
Hope with him has fled 
From our home, now sad and loni 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead ; 
Gone in childhood's bloom— 
Pillow'd now his little head 
In the cold and silent tomb. 
O'er his grave the daisies blossom, 
Where his little form is laid; 
And the murm'ring streamlet plays 
'Neath the willow's quiet shade. 
Close the shutters, kc. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead; 
Death has claimed him now; 
Never more his smile will shed 
Sunshine on poor mother's brow. 
She is almost broken-hearted, 
And our home is sad to-day; 
Life has lost its hope and joy, 
Since our Willie's gone away. 
Close the shutters, kc.

CHEESE."

CARTEL in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington 
Written by GEO. COES for, and originally sung with great 
success by, BILLY CARTER. 
Beans, beans! Boston baked beans! 
Served up for breakfast on Sunday morn, 
With codfish balls, brown bread, coffee and cream— 
Is a 
dish that is fit for a 
Queen—sure your born. 
Whenever you go to Boston town, 
Get somebody to show you round; 
For fifteen cents you can get your fill 
At Beverly's, for they grow there still, 
Smoking hot upon the plates, I dearly love those 
"Yankee dates. 
Oh give me beans, beans, etc., (repeat first four lines.) 
Hash, hash, mysterious hash! 
In a 
second class hotel you never miss hash ; 
Hash, hash, beautiful hash ! 
Its a 
bard crowd to tackle, but easy to catch ; 
travel'd this country through and through, 
This famous conundrum is always new. 
Talk of scrambled eggs, crumbs or crust, 
But mysterious hash is more robust ; 
Reed birds, quail, champagne and ice, 
Canary birds stuiT'd is all very nice— 
Oh but give me hash, etc., (repeat first four lines, )

SPOKEN. — We'll change the subject, and spring from 
love to Spring. 
Cheese, cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Oh sweet is the perfume that wafts on the breeze, 
In Grobe's Saloon I 
take my ease, 
And revel in lager and Limburger cheese. 
Of all the cheese that e'er was made, 
Limburger throws them all way in the shade, 
Nothing will make your skin so neat— 
Nothing will make you feel so sweet; 
Talk of love in Cupid's bowers, 
Talk of the Balm of a 
Thousand Flowers— 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! but give me the cheese, Limburger cheese! 
Oh sweet is the perfume that wafts on the breeze, 
In Grobe's Saloon I 
take my ease, 
And revel in lager and Limburger cheese!

Who said you Dutch gallout,

He took me to the station house, 
And I

Was waiting for the Duke.

By perhaps another day, 
So you will, then, dearest mother, 
Put my little shoes away.

Her mother was his early love, 
Her sire his boyhood's friend, 
And when they pass'd away, their child, 
The old man vow'd to tund. 
She was the sunshine of his home, 
A 
rose so bright and fair, 
With all her mother's loving ways, 
Her eyes and golden hair, 
Her eyes and golden hair. 
What wonder to his lonely heart 
Crept back the love',of old, 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold; 
But autumn may not wed with spring, 
He cherished it untold. 
One day there came a 
seemly knight, 
To woo her from his side, 
The old man smiled upon him, 
For her sake, his joy and pride, 
His joy and pride. 
But fickle was the knight and false, 
(A story threadbare old.) 
He woo'd ter for a 
little while, 
Then wed for lands and gold. 
A 
blighted flower can bloom no more, 
The old man wept one day, 
As murmuring the name she lov'd, 
His darling pass'd away,' 
to murmuring the name she lov'd,

When first the sound of battle came, 
We gaily marched away, 
For when we heard our country call, 
We could not but obey; 
For truth and right the first to fight 
And never known to flee, 
Our fathers recognize their sons, 
The gallant Ninth are we.

A 
hundred years ago we stood in fight arrayed, boys, 
And boldly met the foe, for truth and liberty: 
Our voice is living still, and we should be obeyed, boys, 
Who gave our lives to make you free a 
hundred years ago. 
A 
little band of earnest men, 
Who knew no law but right; 
We just a

Set Freedom's torch alight,

Written by Jour( FIELDING. Sung by the World's Premier ' Irish

'Twas on the Fourth of last July, 
This is the truth and not a 
lie, 
That Dan McGowan and Mary Maloye, 
In wedlock were united ; 
And as they had some cash on hand, 
Says Dan, our w edding will be grand; 
More power to you, says Mary Ann. 
Now who shall be invited: 
The Clanceys, Fagins, and the Doyle. 
Mnrphys, Dngins, and the Gores,

The Delivers, and a 
hundred more. 
Cuonns. 
'Pon me word, the President's Ball, 
Or a 
fair at Donigall! 
Finnigan's wake was nothing at all 
compared to tills wedding. 
Music playing, whiskey flying, 
Boys and girls with love a 
dying— 
Children in the corne.s crying— 
At McGowan's wedding. 
Some were playing forty-fives--
More of them were shaking dice— 
And the girls were making pies; 
The bride was telling stories. 
Some were smoking their dudheens. 
And boys a 
hugging their Colleens; 
More were eating Pig's crubeens ; 
Sure all were in their glory. 
Fiddlers playing jigs and reels— 
I 
tell you they were a 
happy lot,— 
until the whiskey made them squeal— 
That was the time that things got hot!

Melah, murder, what a 
time 
Did'nt we see them cut a

Drinking whiskey, sometimes wide.

The birds do sing, and so do I, 
And rise at early morn: 
To reap and mow, to till and sow, 
The land with plough and team, 
There's nought can IRat a

Out in the fields so green.

Out in the green & ids, a 
raking of the hay, 
Out in the green fields, I

And like a

whistle in the morning. 
If corn be ripe, why then we reap, 
And swing the threshing flail, 
And when comes round the harvest home, 
We drink our home-brew'd 
With sunshine bright, our hearts are light, 
The golden ears we glean, 
And merry make, with ale and cake, 
Out in the fields so green. 
SPOKEN.—Ah, harvest-home be the time for country lads to 
enjoy themselves, what with eating and drinking, and dancing 
with the lasses, we have a 
rare merry making--
Out in the green fields, otc. 
Aye—doant I

The faircst of the fair, 
She's rounl and plump, can ride, and jump 
A

her eyes are bright, her step is light, 
As graceful as a 
Queen, 
And doant she love a 
dance wi' 
Out in the fields so green. 
Out in the green

Some like the fashions of the town, 
The gaities of Court, 
Give I 
the chase, the hurdle race, 
And ev'ry country sport; 
I 
do not care, for gas, and gl ire, 
The gayest sight e'er seen, 
I

Out in the fields so green. 
Out in the greell field, etc.

The Utile Flirt.—Contains the Secrets of Handkerchief, 
Glove, and Parasol Flirtations ; the correct interpretation of all Signals, 
superior to the deaf and dumb alphabet, as the notice of bystandere 
is not attracted; the most delicate hints ian be given without danger of 
, 
misunderstanding—also, the Flora language of Love. 
The whole form-
ing a 
rare amusement for young ladies and gentlemen. Read what two 
leading New York papers say of it: 
The N. Y. Evening Mail writes: 
" 
A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. 
FISFIER'S, 98 Nas-
sau street Ca led the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it dopy without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it.' and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "fining." 
The N. ...T.. Eeening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a neat littia 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. OS Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus op randi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do Lot hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

way as to give opportu• 
nity for a 
decidedly puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary ap. 
pearance of a 
child's picture book, gaily printed and colored, it is sr, 
bound that a 
practised manipulator taking it up and flirting at(' leavet 
over, can make it appear to be filled only with one picture, or with blank 
pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of figures. 
One minute the 
pamphlet, quickly thumbed, appears to contain nothing but the portrait 
of Harlequin, in his tesselated suit • the next only Columbine, then 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephistophiles. A little 
practice, and the directions printed with the book will make anybody 
at home in the handling of it."— Phil. Eve. Bull... . Price 30 Cents

Courti, g. Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from do.ng anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, manylives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence v. hich might have been prol
onged 
and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
Cie b 0 
ntiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
1 but may be enjoyed by. evening parties
