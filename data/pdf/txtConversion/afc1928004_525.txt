That go so far away;

Or else to Rockaway. 
There is nothing suits me better,

As to spend a

Up at Jones' Wood.

Waltzing all around; 
Oh, my lovely Sally, 
I'll never leave this town.

-When the breeze would do you good, 
And I'll hug you and I'll kiss you, 
Up at Jones' Wood. 
I'll ask you, lovely Sally, 
If you will be my bride; 
'We will wander arm-in-arm, love, 
By the lone East River side. 
It's then I'll await your answer, 
And be it bad or good, 
And I'll hug you and I'll kiss you, 
Up at Jones' Wood. 
It's there the pretty, etc.

MARY THE WALKER. 
Written expressly for M URPHY and M ACK by FRANK E. 
McNisa. 
Am—Biddy the Ballet Girl. 
I 
am in love with a 
bouncing fat girl, 
Who is known all over creation; 
She beats the life out of Harrigan's Mary Ann, 
Or Dr. Landis for a 
good education; 
A masher she is called on the street, 
In the " Black Crook" she does the statues; 
But lately she has canceled all dates, 
And is off her nut on walking matches. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, her front name she says it is Mary, 
And she is a 
bouncing fat fairy, 
It is no use to talk, she's a 
daisy to walk, 
She has the score-board all marked with long streaks 
of chalk. 
As around on the track she goes creeping, 
And time to the music keeps beating, 
The men they all shout, " Give it up, you're too 
stout!" 
But Mary sticks out to the finis. 
Next Monday night she starts out 
To try and beat Harriman and Ennis, 
And if they don't do better than before, 
I'm sure that their names will be Dennis. 
Next season she goes out with me, 
Then I'll be as proud as a 
lord, 
No danger of my trunk's getting stuck, 
For Mary'll walk off with the board. 
Oh, her front name, etc. 
THE DANCE AT BATTERY PARK. 
Sung by J. E. 
MURPHY of M URPHY and MACK, in his origin% sketch, 
" 
The Wedding Day." 
2Cutic and words copy-right, 1879, and published by E. II. 1/ARDING, 
229 Bowery, N. Y. 
For fun, for sport and merriment, 
After working hard all day, 
Go down to tlx Battery, that's the place 
To drive dull care away. 
They have a 
band of music there, 
Where the boys and girls have a 
lark, 
It's better than Newport or Long Branch, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
CHORUS. 
You'd split your sides a 
laughing 
To hear Crook's Concert Band, 
The boys play concertinas, 
And the girls they look so grand; 
They dance around like fairies, 
And then commence to spark, 
It's better than Newport or Long Branch, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
You never saw such a 
happier lot 
In the course of all your life, 
Young men of twenty with their girls, 
The workingman and his wife. 
They're happy as if they were kings and queens 
They're bound to have a 
lark, 
Would set you -wild, the music would, 
The dance at Battery Park. 
All classes are represented there 
Every Tuesday and Friday nights, 
The best of order is maintained 
And not a 
single fight. 
It is always crowded, yes, 
From six till after dark, 
The pivoters and spielers are always there, 
To dance at Battery Park.

THE WAY WE MARCH. 
Original words and music by JOHN E. 
MURPHY, and sung by Mut,Pin 
and 31AcK. 
Good-evening to you, one and all, 
We ask your kind attention; 
The subject of our song ' tis one 
To you all now -we'll make mention. 
It's about a 
day that's not far away, 
Though it comes but once a 
year, 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
CHORUS. 
The bands will play, and the fifes will play, 
As down Broadway we march away; 
That's the time we'll all feel gay, 
On St, Patrick's Day in the morning. 
Now if on that day we should meet, 
We hope you won't get offended, 
For what we say and do that day 
It never was intended.' 
When we march out we know what we're about, 
That's the time the boys will shout; 
And before it's night we are kicked out 
Of the barrooms in the city. 
The bands will play, etc. 
We learned our marching in the war, 
We fought with George McClellan; 
We was high private in the rear, 
This is the truth we're telling. 
And when we're out upon parade, 
We throw all others in the shade; 
We march along in the Fenian Brigade 
On St. Patrick's Day in the morning. 
The bands will play, eto. 
Original words and music by Jolts E. Mrarmr, and sung by INIertrint 
and MACK with great success. 
We just dropped in to see you, friends, 
And hope you are all well, 
And of our emigration 
To you we'll quickly tell. 
We left our native country 
For to cross the briny sea, 
For to try and better our fortune here 
In sweet America. 
Cllonus. 
Then we can't forget old Ireland, and the Paddies 
evermore, 
And the rosy Irish lasses so enchanting, 
And the merry happy dances we had upon the floor, 
When we kicked away the boards with our dancing. 
There's a 
land that's in this world, my boys, 
We're praying hard to see, 
And we hope it won't be very long 
Before that she is free. 
For her rivers, her hills and her valleys 
Are so beautiful and grand, 
We would like to go back home again 
To our own dear native land. 
Then we can't, etc.

When we sing our tra-la-la-lee 
In the Murphy Sangerbund. 
We rub our voices wid bay-rum, • 
To make them strong and tough, 
And when we all sing for-tay, 
Why on weak tin ears it's rough. 
We sing " Grandfather's on our block," 
And " In the " Sweet by-bye," 
Wid such wild sweetness, that you'd love 
To lie you down and die. 
Then hear the melody, etc.

In all the festive glory 
Of gay flags and banners bright, 
The merry picnic barge is drifting, 
Thro' the starry night; 
And borne across the waters 
Come sounds of music sweet, 
And merry laugh, and joyous shout, 
And pat of tripping feet, oh! 
CHORUS. 
On the picnic barge they dance, 
In the moonlight soft they dance, 
Down the river gliding free, 
To rich music's melody; 
'Round the deck the merry feet, 
In a 
jolly measure beat, 
Whirl and glide, as down with the tide, 
On the barge they lightly dance. 
A vision of rare beauty, 
Floating gently down the stream, 
Thro' plashing waters silvered 
By each brilliant moonlight beam. 
A time for joy and pleasure, 
For merry dance and song, 
A time to tell love's sweetest story, 
While we drift along. 
On the picnic barge, etc.

I 
know you'll have pity 
When you hear what I

Arrah, stag the old guy. 
CHORUS.

Go shoot that hat quick,

A 
charming young damsel 
I

A

Says she, go drop on yourself, 
You ould flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, etc.

How are you to-day? 
They'll hand me a

I'm a 
gentleman then, 
And no flannel mouth Mick. 
For they yell out, eta.

THE WILD IRISH ROVERS. 
Original by MURPHY and MACS. 
We've just come down here for to sing you a 
song, 
And we tell you we're not going to keep you too long; 
If you think that we are, you'll see that's where you 
are wrong, 
For we have to go home in the morning. 
My name is Tim Doolan—and my name is Pat, 
If you want to see dancing, just sand out of that. 
We're both Irish boys, from the crowns of our hats, 
And old Ireland is the land we were born in. 
CHORUS. 
For we're the boys the shillelah to whack, (Break) 
All over Cork county, to Limerick and back, 
We're known as the wild Irish rovers. 
We traveled to Connaught, from that to Tyrone, 
And we walked all the way to the bridge of Athlone, 
Through Dublin and Kerry and Wexford alone, 
We roamed all around through the ckyver. 
We sailed over to France, from that into Spain, 
And we're going to America by the next train; 
filo we'll bid you good-bye, but we'll come back again, 
And we'll still be the wild Irish rovers. 
For we're the boys, etc.

AIR—Forget Afe Not. 
Oh, I'm in love with all the girls, 
The short, the lean, and tall, 
And I 
know that they are gone on me, 
For after me they call; 
There goes the beau ideal of man, 
I 
wish he'd conic this way; 
But I 
surprise them all, indeed, 
When this to them I 
say— 
Cuonus. 
Get thee gone, you naughty girls, 
Ui .strike you with my stick; 
If ever I blow my breath on you, 
I'll make you fearful sick. 
Your mamma she won't know you. 
When you go home to hash, 
So keep away from me, I 
say, 
For I'm not on the mash. 
One young girl, she loved me so, 
She wanted me to elope; 
One hundred thousand dollars had she, 
While my poor bank was broke. 
I 
says, young lady, you must know 
That I 
love single days; 
Yourself or money I 
don't want, 
So this to her I 
says— 
Get thee gone, etc.

In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove.

All came in a

To take the dice and shake them ntiv, 
And try and win the stove. 
CIIORIIS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand clelight to see the sight of those Irishmen so gay; 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life, 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife, 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot hie,. 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
Forward four, allaman, 
At six o'clock in the morning, 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk, 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bottle, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke.

Sitting in the parlor all the while; 
Sure Smith so queer does talk, 
And has such a

Wid pleasure every one begins to smile. 
When Miss Clancy does appear, 
Such curious things you hear: 
" 
Miss Clancy dear, you're looking all serene 
She smiles and bows her head, 
To the piano she lightly treads, 
And all these pretty songs she sings to me:

As sung by Munpny & NAM 
It's very strange indeed in me, 
That go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks I 
hear 
About me ev'ry day; 
wr was but last night upon the street 
My style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " you can have It, pads, 
If you guess what it is!" 
SPOitnic.—As soon as they saw me they shouted: 
"Here it comes!" and as I 
approached they all began 
to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it? 
Heavens! what is it? 
Does it live, do you know? or is it a 
chronic)? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out? 
Oh! for heaven's sake, what is it? 
"Twas in the park, a 
lively mob 
At me did talk and stare, 
"I wonder if it's loaded, 
And if that's all its own hair." 
" 
It lives, it breathes," one chap did sar, 
"It's pulse is all serene," 
Approaching me, " Old Krank," says hA. 
"I'll see that you're kept green'!"

say a word back, Aley

again comes the conundrum— 
What is it? etc. 
They ask how lone I 
walked alone, 
And say " when were you canned?" 
And hint I'd look much better, 
If upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, 
With glove and edhe and 
I 
hear thGan whisper ev'rywhere, 
wonder if it's ripe!" 
What In it

I 
MARRIED BIDDY McCARTHY. 
I 
went down to Goerck street 
To a 
nice little surprise party, 
And the charmer that I 
met there was 
The darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
Now Biddy was the finest girl, 
And the amusement of the party, 
Says I, I'm surely dead in love 
With the darling, Biddy McCarthy. 
CHORUS. 
With me tra-la-lee, now don't you see, 
I'm gone on Biddy McCarthy. 
(Repeat) 
We danced the polka " mazourka," 
Likewise the dizzy lanciers, 
And as we moved around the floor 
We were two darling dancers. 
Says Biddy sure I 
feel afraid 
That I'll have to shake the party, 
I 
says wait awhile until I 
smile, 
And I'll go home with you Biddy McCarthy. 
With me tra-la-lee, etc. 
As I 
went home to Biddy's house 
A 
laughing, talking, chatting, 
I 
met her father at the door 
All out of breath a 
panting, 
Says he, now Biddy where did you get this, 
Did you get him at the party ? 
Oh, yes, your honor, was the reply 
From darling Biddy McCarthy. 
With me tra-la-lee, etc. 
I 
am happy now, I 
have a 
cow, 
Likewise a 
pig and a 
daughter, 
I 
live in a 
cot in a 
shady spot 
Away across the water. 
-My mother-in-law she calls on me, 
She is a 
roaring tartar, 
Her huiband as well is like a 
bull, 
But I 
love my Biddy McCarthy.

Politely hearken fondly, while 
I 
sing of Levi Kassiday, 
N'blazing star of solid style ; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan', 
Wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's a 
few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A-down the street with stately tread? 
And style that dislocates them all, 
Meanders he, enveloped in, 
A 
brand new fresh spring suit of gaul ; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A Don Juba:Ines in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, eta. 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast" in " Pinafore." 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canadaw to San Franciscu, 
another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
For he's a 
man, etc.

MURPHY'S DREAM. 
W ritten by GEORGE Mut:Pitv, and performed by GEORGE and 
JOHN MURPHY. 
George and John Murphy stayed out a 
whole night, 
And the truth is they drank too much beer 
And when they got home they both were so tight, 
That both of their heads felt quite queer. 
"Let's sit down and rest ourselves," George said to 
John; 
" 
Let's try and recollect where we've been ;" 
So they sat down, but; oh, in a 
minute or two, 
They were asleep and beginning to dream. 
Now dreaming is funny—your mind wanders away--
Some dream they are a 
king, some a 
goat; 
Why I 
dreamt t'other night, peculiar to say, 
I 
was an engine on the elevated railroad. 
'But the Murphys they dreamed that in Paris they 
were, 
Looking for a 
first-class hotel, 
In their valises was gold, but how it got there 
Neither of the Murphys could tell. 
29 
MURPHY'S DREAM. 
Continued. 
They dreamt George was a 
Dutchman, and that his 
name was Jake, 
With his clothes tore, and bald-headed at that, 
That John was an Irishman, and from jail he (134 
break, 
That his name wasn't John, but was Pat ; 
Among lunatics surely they thought that they were, 
\Niro they tried to kill, strange it did seem ; 
That they were arrested and caught in a 
snare, 
This the Murphys all saw in a 
dream. 
They dreamt to the gallows they both had to go, a, 
their sentence was they had to die ; 
That 
they mounted the 
scaffold, John quickly, 
George slow, and that neither attempted to cry. 
They dreamt that hanging them wasn't severe, 
But imagined that it would cause lots of fun ; 
That the soldiers and sheriffs all stood quite near, 
To make sure that the murderers were hung ; 
They dreamt that the trap 
fell and that they were 
dead, how strange the sensation did seem, 
But the truth was the beer had got into their heads, 
and caused such a 
ridiculous dream.

BARNEY RILEY'S CHOWDER CLUB. 
Written for JOHN MURPHY by JAS. RICHMOND. 
Barney Riley is a 
popular man, 
In politics he is well known; 
He is a 
great favorite with the ladies, 
So is Christopher Henry Malone. 
It was in the sunimer time and they longed for sport, 
The heat had reduced them all to a 
frame, 
So they started a sort of a 
chowder club for pleasure, 
The first rainy day that Caine. 
CHORUS. 
Barney Riley, Miss McCann, 
Jerry O'Brien and Lizzie McMahon, 
Katie McGuire and Chris Malone, 
Johnnie Dwyer and Maggie McGlone. 
Dennis Mullaley and Alice Ross, 
Of all the pivoters, they were the boss; 
At four they sat down to eat off a 
big washtub, 
And then the stage brought home the merry 
chowder club. 
fhey all declared they never liad such sport 
Since the day that they were born 
As when O'Brien had a 
clam-shell hid in his throat, 
And he'd talk like an old fish horn. 
The chowder was so hot it set fire to Lizzie Kelly's 
mouth, 
And burned the springs of Johnnie Dwyer's legs and 
pants, 
They had so much fun they are going to send 
Seven hundred and one invitations to their sisters, 
cousins and aunts. 
The stage drove home at the rate of half a 
mile a 
year,. 
The boys and girls all were friskey, 
The drivers were so drunk they couldn't hold the reins, 
And the stage was floating in whiskey. 
They were walking on oysters, cake and tambourine 
pie, 
And some of them walking on their head, 
It was a 
funny sight about twelve o'clock at night 
r10 see the chowder party tumbling into bed.

TILE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
W ritten by FRANK E. McNisx expressly for MuErie? & MAcrc. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for steRling things could not be beat, 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun, 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of bay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole row of footlights off from the stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
All kinds of fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple from Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bread of a 
family of very bad rank, 
He stole all the bonds in the Manhattan Bank. 
The Elevated Road he would have .g 
ot 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out West and colored all tramps ; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's Garden he colored the track, 
He even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
And still he wasn't satisfied--
The man that stole the countine 
' 
TE.:•; " t'--.- '1H:, "31-01L_Tel THE COUNTE,Y. 
Continual. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life-time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent. 
The man that stole the country. 
But the villain he was very bold; 
And prison walls could not him hold. 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country.. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots, a 
tub and a 
saw, 
The wenderful man with with the cast-iron jaw, 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went t. l'ireci Orleans and took the fever; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park. 
Stele a 
street car, the driver and all. 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall.

I'll sing to you of a

Who was born with a 
terrible gani; 
lie lived in Cohoes—wore low neck shoe.4. 
And the top of his head was bald, 
lie applied for a 
situation 
As a 
revenue stamp collector; 
He was on the fake and took the cake, 
This guy with the lung protector. 
CHORUS. 
He said he was the president in the sweet by-and-by, 
lie was on the mash and tackled hash ; 
This gawk with the red neck tie, 
He rode the elephant around the ring, they say he 
was very queer, 
He got shot in the head with a 
rotten tomato, and 
then flew off on his ear. 
They say that he lives in this city, 
And he sleeps on the floors of saloons ; 
He lives on sawdust and crackers, 
And his business is juggling spittoons, 
He's known by every barkeeper 
As a 
bum and the worst of them all, 
He thinks he's an elegant bruiser, 
The man with a 
terrible gaul.

There's a 
man lives in this alley with me, 
He's an Irishman from France; 
He's got a 
dizzy daughter, yes, 
That takes in every dance. 
She bleeches her just once a 
week, 
She is the reigning belle; 
Oh, she ain't to blame, this dizzy dame, 
She is Mulligan's daughter Nell. 
CHORES. 
She bangs her hair and her mother's besides 
And a 
blow from her fist would tell: 
At night she will roar and rap on the door, 
(Answer outside) Who's there? 
Mulligan's daughter Nell. 
Oh, she s mashed on a fellow named Tommy 
Flynn, 
He's one of the gang, you bet, 
And lie's in our alley most every night, 
A whistling for his pet. 
He \thistles " Baby Mine " and " Nancy Lee," 
His name he couldn't speli; 
While puffing his sherroot, the gay galoot, 
He's waiting for Mulligan Nell. 
She bangs her hair, etc 
Oh, I 
wish she'd marry this fellow named Flynn, 
The alley would be ours once more: 
And we would not have him rapping then, 
Or kicking the tenement door. 
The landlord says and the neighbors also, 
They never saw a 
girl like Nell; 
For at night she'll roar and rap on the door. 
And she's always raising Cain. 
She bangs her hair, etc.

MURPHY'S LITTLE BACK ROOM. 
a.—Pat Roach. 
Written and sung by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Did you ever here tell of Ted Murphy, 
He came from the County Mayo, 
He kept a 
bar-room in this city, 
In a 
democratic ward here below. 
His distillery was over in Brooklyn, 
In a 
place that they call Irishtown, 
You'd get a 
bucket of ale for five cents, 
He'd trust whin you'd put money down. 
(Repeat.) 
Success to my friend, Teddy Murphy, 
He often gave me two for one, 
I've played forty-fives at his table, 
Drank his whisky, his beer and rum. 
I've counted the cracks in the ceiling, 
Swept the sand off the flure wid a 
broom, 
I've raffled for many a 
turkey, 
In Ted Murphy's little back room. 
There was laborers, canallers, and riggers, 
Who worked on the docks very hard, 
Shovelmen. pipemen, and drivers,

MURPHY'S LITTLE BACK ROOM. 
(Concluded.) 
There was a 
Dutchman kept over opposite, 
Who was jealous of Ted's rushing trade, 
He put up a 
job one fine evening, 
For the police to go make a 
raid 
On the liquors, barrels and glasses, 
In the bar-room wid their clubs they wine, 
And poor Teddy without provocation, 
To the Island for ten days was slut. 
Poor Teddy he lost his influence, 
In the courts and the grand committee, 
He sarved his fall time in the prison, 
Praying each day to get free. 
He took spunk and jumped in the river, 
To swim to the Long Island shore, 
He got a 
cramp in his leg and his stomach, 
He sank to rise up no more,

MICHAEL MURPHY. 
Sung by ED. HARRIGAN, at Theatre Comiquf 
TEN years ago I 
stepped on board, 
A 
ship to England bound, 
My heart and pockets both were light, 
Though I'd not got a 
pound ; 
I 
was but a 
young greesheen then, 
Without deceit or sham, - 
But times and things have altered 
With myself, and now I 
am— 
Clloaus 
Mister Michael Murphy, a 
man of great ability, 
Known and respected too by all the gentility, 
Patronized, by all the nobs amongst the great nobility, 
For Mister Michael Murphy is a 
well known man. 
I 
got some work to crrry bricks, 
At fourteen bob a 
week, 
But soon I 
got the sack because 
They said I'd too much cheek; 
So I 
fell back upon the club, 
And when I 
let them see. 
That I 
was full of book laming, 
They made .a secetary—of. 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc, 
From that they made me President 
Of our new Home•Rule League, 
And I 
soon got acquainted with 
An M. P., Mister Teague ; 
My speechifying was so good, 
I 
soon got into fame, 
And everybody tells me that 
The man to make a 
name—is 
Mister Michael Murphy, etc..

MY LITTLE ONE WAITING FOR ME. 
IN 
the dell where the brooklets gently flowing, 
On the bench 'neath the old willow tree, 
Where the birds their songs are sweetly singing, 
There my little one's waiting for me; 
And she knows well the sound of my footsteps, 
As I 
cross o'er the bridge by the lea, 
And I 
hasten with arms stretch'd to greet her, 
My little one waiting for me. 
And at night when daily toil is over, 
And I'm wending my way toward my home, 
My heart's always beating with p'easure, 
For my little one surely will come; 
As I 
pass o'er that clear rippling brooklet, 
There, watching, I 
always can see, 
On the bench 'neath the old weeping willow, 
My little one waiting for me.

THE NIGHT I LEARNED TO SWIM. 
Words and Music by THOMAS E. 
POWERS. 
Music published by Mils. PAULINE LIEDER, 6o Chatham street, 
N. V., ( owner of copyright.) 
Sung with immense success by the Popular Irish Comedian and 
Vocalist, JAMES O'NEILL. 
One summer's night, ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock, you know, 
To learn me how to swim; 
They tied a 
rope .around my waist, 
And then they heav'd me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drown'd, 
The night " learned to swim. 
CHORUS. 
Swim out, says Pete, arrah ! kick your feet, 
Go " over- hand," says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh, " chaw roast beef" " the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me, 
They daub'd my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim, 
Both my feet were cut from " copper nails," 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Swim out, etc. 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they roll'd me on a 
barr'l 
For two long hours or more ; 
Shure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim jam-jims, 
I'll ne'er forget as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Swim out, etc. 
O'REILLY'S BILL Y GOAT. 
(A RECITATION.) 
O'Reilly owned a 
billy goat 
And a 
great buck goat was he, 
He would buck almost anything 
That he'd happen for to see. 
And if at night he'd roam the streets 
And a 
drunken man he'd meet, 
He'd buck him till he was sick and tired, 
And then his clothes he'd eat-
0'.R.eilly's billy goat. 
He knew every policeman on the beat, 
And he knew if him they found 
That he'd spend a 
short vacation 
Down here in the city pound. 
He ate Mrs. Mullig,an's underclothes 
That was hanging on the line, 
Shure he bucked a 
Dutchman in the belly, 
And knocked him out of time— 
O'Reilly's billy goat. 
But every goat must have his day, 
And this goat's day did come— 
He met a 
butcher's dog one day, 
And the dog for him did run. 
He chased the goat through the streets, 
Shure the dog for him was too smart, 
He chased him till he lost his wind 
And he died of a 
brol en heart— 
O'Reilly's billy goat. 
sow, down here in a 
vacant lot 
In a 
corner quite alone, 
There we buried o'Reilly's goat, 
And over him raised a 
stone; 
And perchance you'd pass that way, 
You'll find these words on it are wpote: 
Sacred to the memory of 
O'Reilly's great buck goat.

THREE VILLAINS. 
By BOBITY NEWCOM13. 
In olden times, as stories say, 
There lived three urchins miles away 
From town or city, where the light 
Revealed the most astounding sights. 
They villains were—these three small boy 
Who sought for older fun than toys; 
They nightly sighed for wealth to come 
To help them from the village roam. 
And every day these villains met, 
And 'neath a 
shady tree they sat 
To plot and ponder how all three 
Could leave their homes and pirates be. 
At last a 
golden chance it came— 
The mother of one, against the rain 
That comes some day, had saved a 
sum. 
Which was found out by Villain One; 
He'd but to turn the mattress up 
To overflow the pleasure cup, 
For lo! behold! fell on the floor 
The mother's precious golden store. 
Then Villain One, with hasty stride, 
Quickly summoned to his side 
The other villains, and 'neath the tree 
Divided the treasure 'tween the three; 
But first to purchase knife and gun, 
A 
pistol, too, for Number One, 
Three belts, some powder, cap and ball, 
And then for town they started all. 
At a 
wayside house they stopped for cheer, 
And noisily drank, in pots of beer, 
Such murderous toasts with boastful sway 
That even the waiters ran away. 
Then Villain One revealed his plan, 
Surrounded by his faithful clan— 
How a 
rakish vessel he'd command 
And thus address his cutthroat band: 
" 
My flag shall be as black as night, 
With skull and crossbones marked in white; 
On every sea I'll call all mine, 
„i‘..nd blood we'll drink Instead of wine; 
THE THREE VILLAINS, 
(Concluded.) 
We'll capture schooners, brigs and yawl, 
And fight until the last man falls. 
Rich Spanish galleons filled with. gold, 
Fine East India ships with wealth untold, 
And now and then a 
ship from Cadiz 
Cargo'd with shawls and silks and ladies." 
And then he whispered: " ' Twixt me and you, 
I'd share the spoil among the crew. 
But first of all I'd choose the best, 
And into the sea I'd throw the rest." 
Then, slouching his hat, with villainous leer 
He drank with an oath a 
bumper of beer. 
And then the Second Rogue spoke up, 
As on the table he brought his cup: 
" 
A knight of the road I'm going to be— 
And a 
big black horse I'll ride so free; 
Stand and deliver!" shall be my cry— 
I'll ride o'er gates full twelve feet high; 
To blow out the brains of farmer or gent 
Will be but a 
joke when on mischief bent; 
I'll wear a 
mask and look like a 
ghost; 
1'11 wake up the inn and then shoot the host; 
Mothers will tremble to hear of my fame, 
And the nursery sleep if they sound my name; 
1'11 break out of prison and murder the jailor; 
While I 
stay on land, you'll be a 
sailor." 
Number Three remained quiet—as the others closed, 
They asked him to tell how he was disposed. 
Be thought for a 
moment, was very reflective, 
And then answered quickly: " I'll be a 
detective— 
And, to show you I 
mean every word that I 
say, 
I'll arrest Knight and Pirate and cart ' em away." 
Then, true to his word (though he helped them to 
fleece), 
He handed them in to the nearest police. 
Next morning, of course, their parents were found, 
And the villains received a 
thrashing most sound, 
And so it is thus, and so it's been ever, 
If a 
thief patch a 
thief, he's voted most clever.

When gloom of life's evening has vanished, 
And calm tranquil light smiles on high; 
For God will assist us, . dear mother.

A 
privilege it is to be horn in this land 
Of the noble, the proud and the free, 
Where each man will offer his heart and his hand, 
To drive out such cruel tyranny. 
Such as was practiced by English rule, 
In thc days of oppression gone by ; 
But like solid men to the front they did come . 
Determined to conquer or die. 
CnoRus. 
Then good people here just take my advice, 
No matter whatever you lag ; 
If you should have the honor to adopt this land, 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
If you take this advice you will surely find 
A 
blessing you'll find in the end ; 
And you will be loved by the good and the kind, 
If to your duty you do well attend. 
But be not. like the men who would gain themselves; 
wealth, 
And to crime they will let themselves drag ; 
But be honest and upright, and above all you do,. 
Pray never go back on the flag. 
Then good people, etc. 
It was under that flag that Benjamin Franklin 
born, 
A 
statesman both noble and true. 
Thou :di poor at the first, yet himself he did raise, 
To be proud of the red, white and blue. 
It was under that flag that George Washington wai-
born, 
The father of this country, 
And with many others he nobly fought,
