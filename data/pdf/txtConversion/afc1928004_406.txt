VISION OF MY DREAM. 
Written by Wally West. Sung only by " Les Grotesque Eeeentriques" 
Haley and West. 
Upon a 
little mossy bank beside a 
rippling stream, 
I 
lay nie down one summer eve and fell into a 
dream. 
I 
seemed to be in Fairyland while voices sweet and clear. 
In delicious strains of music sweet, fell upon my ear, 
Their queen appeared, I 
started, for beside the meadow stream, 
Appeared in all her loveliness, the vision of my dream. 
CHORUS. 
S(.; bewilderingly beautiful this pretty girl did seem. 
I 
felt my heart leap forth to meet the vision of my dream. 
At first so great was my surprise, I 
knew not what to say, 
For the sight of so much loveliness quite took my breath away, 
Then starting up I 
culled a 
bunch of violets from the ridge, 
And placed them ' mongst her curls just as she crossed the 
rustic bridge, 
She thanked me with a 
sweet, sweet smile, her eyes with love 
did beam, 
I 
poured forth all my heart and love, to the vision of my dream. 
Cimut-s. 
So bewilderingly beautifu l etc 
As we onward walked, of love we talked, till 
she said 
twas 
time to go, 
I 
pressed a 
kiss of true love on her forehead white as snow. 
I 
asked her if she'd be my wife, she said she couldn't say. 
lint she'd answer me down by the bridge if id meet her there 
sonie day, 
I 
went, but I 
shan't tell you wh-t - he said there by the stream, 
Next Sunday eve I'm going to see the vision of my dream. 
Cuont 
So bewitchint.s.ly beautiful, .etc. 
Words by Gustavus Peters. 
Music by Francesco Lumb. 
Sung by all the breakneeks. 
Oh, here we are, the very woist of all the dizzy hams, (buff) 
We can't go in the ballet, cause we dont show up good gambs, 
(biin 
1.t.t 
et we are two actors, and •` we're happy as two clams" 
vVe do a 
flip, and a 
funny fall, and you bet we are two hams. 
CHORUS. 
Oh. toy here we a. 
two dizzies, 
. - 
And when you talk about your hams, now don't you 
we'll do, 
Oh my, " you bet your lips, we are the boss ! " 
The only hit weever made, was out in Kalamazoo. 
DON'T YOU WISH YOU COULD. 
Song and dance, composed and arranged by Mr. H. C. Dobson, 
America's greatest banjo master. 
Oh, such a 
beauty, 
I 
ne'er can forget, 
In the park while walking, 
The first time we met, 
Her sunny curls were peeping, 
Beneath her little hood, 
And as I 
tried to catch her said, 
Now don't .-
ott wish you could. 
CHORUS. 
think 
Looking like a 
daisy, 
I 
thought I 
should go crazy. 
When she threw a 
glance at me, 
I 
scarce knew where I 
stood, 
Oh, wouldn't you like to see her now, 
Oh don't you wish you could, Oh! 
You bet our song belongs to us and never was sung before.(bany) 
The words are by Owney Geoghegan, and the music by Lula 
Moore, (bang) 
We sang it once, and only once, 'cause we got no other chance, 
The manager asked us what it was, we said' " breakneck song 
& dance." 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my here we are two dizzies, 
And when you talk about your hams, now don't you 
we'll do, 
Oh my, " you bet your lips, we are the boss !" 
The only hit we ever made. was mit in Kalamazoo. 
The next time I 
met her, 
How we did chat, 
The rain was falling fast, 
And spoiled her little .hat, 
And as I 
tried to kiss her. 
While at the door we stood. 
She winked at me and then she said, 
Now don't you wish you could 
CHORUS. 
think 
I 
called upon her nightly, 
She treated me politely. 
I 
asked her if she'd marry me. 
It was all understood, 
Oh, wouldn't you like to be in my place, 
Oh, don't you wish you could, Oh ! 
Irish ballad, sung by " Les Grotesques Eccentrique " Haley & West 
in their beautiful society sketch, entitled " Down on the old 
Plantation Bitters." 
In Erin's isle, the shamrock's home, lives the darling of my 
heart, 
I 
see her yet, I 
can't forget when Kate and I 
did part, 
I 
soothed her sorrow, bid farewell, then murmured "Kitty think 
of me," 
Then grasped her father's hand, and left them to cross the 
stormy sea, 
I 
whispered. Kitty. don't forget, but to me still be true, 
LII soon return to Innesfell, my colleen, dear, for you. 
Katy, my darling, when tempests be snarling. 
The faith of my colleen, will shield me from harm, 
Pure as the flowers, washed by the showers, 
Katy, my darling, you're prosence is a 
charm. 
ne'er fore-et, when first we met, down by the old oak 
And the sweet things that you told me then, are sounding 
me still, 
You told me Kitty, that you loved me, that you'd given me 
your heart, 
That you would be true unto me, ' till death did us part, 
Oh, Katy, darling, don't forget, but to me still be true, 
I'll soon return to Erin's isle, my colleen, dear, for you. 
mill' 
to 
v, my darling, blithe as a 
starling. 
I'll still try to be though my heart's bowed with care, 
By the bright stars above me, still will I 
love thee, 
My heart's only darling, my sweet Kitty Clare.

Down south iii Louisiana. mong the cotton and the cane, 
This nigger always happy was, he'd never borrow pain, 
I 
never had no work to do, except to hoe the corn, 
Oh, / wish that I 
was back again, tc that place where I 
was 
born. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, down among the cotton, this nigger he was born, 
Down among the cotton, the sugar cane and corn, 
Oh, I 
wish that I 
was back again, in the Louisiana bottom, 
I'd be just as happy as a 
bumble bee, down among the cotton. 
'Twas there this niggerfell in love with little Dinah Brown, 
She was the prettiest yellow wench in all the country round, 
She told me that she loved me once, when we were shucking 
corn, 
Oh, I 
spect she's waiting for me there, in that place where I 
was born. 
Oh, down among the cotton, this nigger he was born,

bumble bee, down among .he cotton.

Cause she has 11.111 a

And given me the slinky, 
She's gone mit another snoozer, 
Who thinks he yos a 
bruiser, 
But I 
know dot he'll abuse her, 
Und dot my heart vottld break. 
For she's so sweet, so quite complete, 
'Lind dresses up in style so very neat, 
She stole my heart away from me, 
Did pretty Deitch Louise. 
She's the sweetest girl I 
ever met, 
But, oh, she vos a 
Very wild coquette, 
Yea I 
think of her my eyes with tears are wet, 
Cud dot always makes me sneeze, 
But, oh, ill surely miss her, 
I 
never more shall kiss her, 
Oh, I 
would be in bliss, her 
Lovely waist to squeeze. 
But now she's given me the shake, 
I 
know dot almost makes my heart to break,

think I'll go and jump into the lake, 
Und 50 I'll end my woes.

Of all the pretty, winsome girls that ever yet were seen, 
My 'Mita with the jet black curls, must surely be the queen, 
She is the sweetest maiden who has ever charmed my eyes, 
And when I 
marry her 
m sure that I 
shall get a 
prize.

In the forcst ' neath the murmuring pines, where first I 
met 
my love, 
Her bright eyes pierced me through and through, I

knelt down on it mossy bank and offered her Ply heart. 
She said she'd give me her's instead, for ' twits pierced with 
Cupia's dart.

MOONLIGHT. 
FLIP FLAP ON MY EAR. 
Written by Wally West. Sung only by Haley & West. 
Of all the pleasant ways to spend a 
charming summer night, 
The nicest is to take a 
sail ' neath Luna's melting light, 
The other eve I 
asked my girl, if she with me would go, 
She answered yes and what we did I 
now will tell to you. 
We were sailing o'er the lake, the moon in beauty shone, 
The birds all sang with light free hearts, responsive to our 
own 
'Unheeded thus time passed away, till the waves began to 
break, 
Reminding us ' twas time to leave, the charming moonlit 
lake. 
Our little bark so lightly rode the white crowned glistening 
waves 
Which glowed beneath the pure moonlight, like coral from 
their caves, 
We sang our love songs, and the sound the echoes did awake, 
-We plighted troth that summer night, out on the moonlit 
lake.

-We were sailing o'er the lake the moon in beauty shone,

Written by Haley & West, expressly for and sung only by Gus Peters 
the original breakneck song & dance man. 
I 
am a 
lively little moke, without a 
thought of care 
I 
sing and dance both night and day with heart as light as 
air. 
I've got a 
girl and she loves me, she's the sweetest ever seen, 
She wears a 
number eleven shoe, she is my fairy queen, 
took her to a 
ball, she was the pride of all, 
This charming little dear, 
But she opened all their eyes, and took them by surprise, 
sor 
When she threw a 
double flip flap on her ear. 
Of all the girls you ever saw she is the boss of all, 
She's got a 
hand just like a 
ham so delicately smalt, 
ller mouth looks like a 
liver split, and dark green are her 
eyes, 
She's got a 
bump upon her back, and her ears are such a 
size, 
As we walk along the street, the gents all smile so sweet, 
We're known both far and near, 
But it ' aint every body knows that I 
stand upon my nose, 
And throw a 
double flip flap on my ear.

THE IRISH GENTLEMAN. 
Written by Wally West. Music by Petruchio Haley. 
I'm an Irishman from Donegal, 
Though I'm sure you'd never guess, 
If I 
had only left you 
To judge it from my dress, 
I'm a 
representative Irishman, 
And I'm here to prove to you, 
That in Ireland, as well as here, 
There are gentlemen full true. 
CHOnt7s. 
I'm proud to say I'm Irish. 
Deny it I 
never can, 
I'm a 
true representative of Erin's green isle, 
And an Irish gentleman. 
We see men come upon the stage, 
Who pretend to represent, 
With peculiar brogue, the character, 
Of a 
decent Irish gent, 
If they'd try it in old Ireland, 
They soon would understand, 
That the Irishmen repudiate, 
Such an insult to our laud. 
I'm proud to say I'm Irish, etc. 
Some paint their faces like a 
Turk, 
And like Chinamen they talk, 
And all elephant with a 
broken leg, 
Seems the model for their walk, 
If they'd go to Ireland. sure they'd find, 
We're just like all the rest, 
There's gentlemen and ladies there. 
That's equal to their best. 
CHORUS. 
FRI proud to say I'm Irish, etc.

AMONG THE VIOLETS. 
Written by Wally West. Sung only by Haley tt West. 
By the streamlet when the violets bloom, 
As once by chance I 
strolled, 
I 
saw .a 
dazzling picture bright, 
Like rubies set in gold, 
I 
found ' twas the coral lips and golden curls, 
Of it charming girl, 
'Whose heavenly eyes, so dazzling bright. 
Had set my brain awhirl. 
I 
offered her my arm, she took it, 
Then we both did go, 
Strolling by the murmuring streamlet, 
'Where the violets grow. 
Ctionus. 
Oh ! we spoke of love, so fondly then, 
As we wandered through the glen, 
She talked so sweetly then completely, 
Charming me as on we went, 
I 
can't forget that happy meeting, 
Down among the violets. 
But earthly joys must fade away, 
And time must take its flight, 
Yet, though the months have passed since then, 
ne'er forget that night, 
'Tis ever sacred to my heart, 
And will be all through life, 
For as we strolled beside the brook, 
She said she'd be my wife, 
And soon she will confide, 
Her darling self unto my care, 
Then all our paths thrdaigh 
Must be blooming ever bright and fair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! we spoke of love, etc. 
Written by Wally West. Music by Petruchio Haley. 
Sung by the Two Dromios of Ethiopian Comedy, Haley tf. West. 
While walking down the street one eve, 
"Twas in the month of May. 
I 
saw a 
charming little blonde, 
Come tripping o'er the way, 
She was the sweetest creature, 
Whom I 
ever did behold, 
With flashing eyes of azure blue, 
And curls that phone like gold. 
As she tripped across the street, 
I 
saw her pretty feet, 
She looked just like a 
fairy, blithe and gay, 
I 
never shall forget, 
The day when first I 
met, 
My darling, fascinating little Mae. 
I 
followed her some distance, 
In Aopes to catch a 
smile, 
And though she never looked behind, 
She knez it all the while, 
Her silence filled my leart with strength 
And really made me bold. 
So much so that I 
dared to speak. 
She turned her head of gold. 
Her smile like Cupid's dart, 
Pierced through this darkey's heart, 
When she spoke to me she stole my heart away, 
I 
never shall forget, 
That day on which I 
met 
My darling, fascinating atle Mae. 
CRAZY NIGGERS. 
Written by Ned Goss. 
As sung by Goss and Fox. 
People all around the town, 
Say we are insane, 
Cause we've got singing, yes we have, 
And dancing on the brain, 
Our feet are always on the move, 
You cannot keep us still, 
For when we hear the music sound, 
It nearly drives us ill. 
CHORUS. 
We're crazy niggers, always singing, dancing, 
Crazy niggers, you cannot keep us still. 
Repeat. 
Crazy as they say we are, 
We're always on the go, 
if there's any harm in that, 
We should like to know, 
People like to hear us sing, 
And watch us while we dance, 
And we'll try and please you all, 
If you'll give us 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
We're crazy niggers, always singing, dancing, 
Crazy niggers, you cannot keep us still. 
Repeat.

Susozor.—" And as the policeman raised the beautiful 
child, cold and damp from the dews of night, one thought 
alone possessed our minds; What if our dear child had 
shared his fate ?—Morning Paper. 
The labor is over and done, 
The Sun has gone down in the West, 
The birds are asleep every one. 
All nature has gone to its rest ; 
But one little sleeper is out in the cold, 
Alone, in the rain and sleet; 
There's no one to greet him with welcome kissa, 
Or list to his coming feet. 
Caoatts. 
Dead! dead! found dead in the street. 
Dead in the cold night air : 
Dead for the want of a 
crust; 
With no one to pity or care. 
The daisy looks up from the grass, 
Just fresh from the fingsrs of night, 
To welcome the birds as they pass, 
And drink in fresh rivers of light. 
But one little sleeper has gone to his rest— 
Has gone to his Iloavenly birth; 
And there,

GLITTER. 
As sung by Miss ELLA W FSNE.a. 
They're not all gems that glitter, no 
Attractive though they seem, 
For tinsel has a 
spurious glow, 
A 
bright but transient gleam; 
The thoughtless oft aro caught by this, 
And most men may be sold; 
Be careful that you don't get dross, 
Instead of shining gold. 
Ctionus, 
Glitter and glare may make people stars, 
But howe'er dazzling bright it may be. 
Glitter and gloss are nothing but dross; 
Pure gold, pure gold, the metal for me. 
Be ye as chaste, as pure as snow, 
You'll not escape the touch 
Of slander's tongue—be guarded- -and 
It v, . 11 not harm you much. 
Be uprigh, just, and always fair, 
Each debt o .badness pay; 
Let deeds, not words, re±:ect your worth, 
And bear the light of day. 
Glitter and glare, ke 
Pure gold with some is very E 
care 
e , 
But wealth's a 
heeting joy ; 
The wealthy, like the poor, oft have 
their share of life's alloy. 
LA each look round, and if he eau, 
Extend a 
helping hand ; 
The peasant thus may vie the peer— 
mite rieliest in the sand.

Theatre, New York. 
I 
ENTERED the Park on a 
beautiful evening, 
To bask in the pleasures that nature had strewn, 
With a 
bounteous hand for the rich and the poor man, 
Where flowers nestle closely in verdure's full bloom. 
A. policeman was there, and I 
asked his peimissi n 
To wander around through the Park with the mass 
Of the people,. he answered yes, walk tit your leisure, 
But be careful young man, and keep off the grass. 
CHORUS. 
Keep off the grass, keep off the grass; 
Mind what I 
tell you, if I 
let you pass— 
Keep off the grass, keep off the grass, 
I'll bid you good evening, but keep oft the grass. 
Now I 
hadn't gone far when I 
met a 
fair charmer— 
A. beautiful, gushing, dear little maid. 
I 
raised my chapeau, and addressed her quite blandly, 
And asked her if with me she'd I 
romem,de. 
She smiled and looked sweet when I 
asked her this question, 
If strolling with me half an hour she would pass, 
So sweetly she answered, " Yes, sir, with pleasure, 
I'll stroll by your side if you keep off the grass " 
Keep k 
if the grass, 14c. 
Boon after we were married, and quickly I 
found out 
That I 
had caught a 
tartar, you bet, 
Although in some things I 
do think she's perfection, 
Yet I 
often do wish that we never had met. 
Last week I 
saw that policeman one morning, 
And f 
told him of my troubles since wedding this lass, 
But he laughed at me, when he repeated his warning, 
"I told you, young fellow, to keep off the grass." 
SPOKEN. — Now, boys, take my advice, whenever you are 
strolling in the Park, and get up a nice little flirtation with a 
pretty girl. 
Just take my advice, and— 
Keep off the grass, ice.

HURRAH FOR THE MINSTREL BAND! 
Dedicated to HARRY SANDERSON. 
Originally sung by FRANK LEWIS 
Music published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, N. Y. 
Price, 10 ctii 
There is not a 
man in the whole Minstrel Band, 
Who would ever go back on a 
friend ; 
Tho dark be his face, yet the black can't efface 
The kind deeds which through life him attend. 
I 
hear the trumpet sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land— 
I 
list to its voice, and it bids me rejoice ; 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band! 
Then Hurrah! then Hurrah! 
Then hurrah for the Minstrel Band! 
I 
will speak first of one who we loved in the past, 
• „ He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave— 
(else Seymour, who never refused his last dime, 
'If he thought you from hunger twould save. 
'
1 hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land— 
The tall Son of York, he died at his work, 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band ! 
And the pride !—and the pride! 
And the pride of the Minstrel Band! 
Brave Unsworth, he stood like a 
Minstrel so true! 
'Till defeated at last by grim death ; 
And Budworth, alas! broke his old banjo string, 
Which he loved ' till he parted with breath. 
I 
hear their dircr
be 
now sounding, sounding, 
In notes loud and clear through the land. 
They lived and they died with the Boys that they lov'd, 
The dear Boys of the Minstrel Band ! 
The Dear Boys 
the Dear Boys! 
The Dear Boys of the Minstrel Band! 
But now I 
must speak of the Prince of them all--
Who is that but our own gallant Dan! 
Let every one mourn for our Chieftan is gone— 
Dan Bryant! the Minstrel and Man I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding, 
‘In notes loud and clear through the land. 
ie lived and he died, both our glory and pride; 
He was King of the Minstrel Band! 
He was King! he was King! 
He was King of the Minstrel Band',. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
To tell how we're longing to hear 
The footsteps that nevermore come, 
The voice that to us was so dear 
For, oh 1 
you are still, still the same, 
Through dark raging seas may divide; 
We sigh, when we hear your dear name. 
To welcome you back to our side. 
CHORUS. 
We'll write you a 
letter from home, 
We dream of you, darling, each night. 
We love you wherever you roam, 
We'll kiss every word that we write. 
We'll write you a 
letter from horn; 
To bear you our love o'er the sea. 
To gladden your heart as you roam, 
And cheer you wherever you be. 
'Tis lonely while you are away; 
For sweet was the joy that you gave 
Oh I 
sadly we pine while you stray; 
Come back o' 
e 
lone weary wave! 
11 write you a 
letter, kc.

UNDER THE ARCH IN THE PARK, 
Dedicated to Miss JENNIE MORGAN. 
Words by W. E. MCNULTY. 
Music by GEO. VON KAMEKE. 
(Copyrighted.) 
Under the arch in the park, 
We were delightfully dreaming, 
Sweet was the song of the lark, 
Sunbeams around us are streaming ; 
He sat with his hand clasped in mine, 
My heart how I 
longed to unmask it, 
Glad to have said " it is thine." 
Had he the courage to ask it. 
CHORUS. 
Birds ,of the air, joy ous and fair, 
Singing from dawn until dark ; 
'Were you asleep, or did you just peep 
Under the arch in the park ? 
Under the arch in the park, 
Shadows around us were falling, 
Hushed was the song of the lark, 
Only the night-birds were calling; 
He whispered in tenderest strains 
But his love, ah ! he dared Hot reveal it, 
A 
kiss would have soothed all his pains— 
Had he the courage to steal it. 
Birds of the air, etc. 
Under the arch in the park. 
Moonlight around us was shining, 
He timidly made the remark: 
" 
Ohl for a 
heart I 
am pining, 
You might give me yours, love," he said, 
" 
I 
promise you never to break it." 
I 
blushed and I 
hung down my head— 
Then he mustered up courage to take it, 
UNCLE TOM'S RELIGION 
Far away from wife and children, 
Still I 
plod my way along, 
Massa Clare has gone to Eva, 
Leaving friendless poor old Tom! 
Yet, with trust and strength in Heaven, 
I 
remain a 
faithful slave; 
When de whip to me am giben, 
I'll think of Him who died to save! 
Shall I 
turn against my brother, 
Raise the hand of cruelty? 
No! we must love one another, 
Den we'll get where all am free. 
Patience here I'll go to glory, 
There is comfort for the slave ; 
When de lash makes dis flesh gory, 
I'll pray to him who died to save. 
Good bye, Chloe, farewell children, 
Poor old Tom you'll see no more; 
Mind, be good and hab religion, 
'Twill bear you to the faithful shore. 
Do not weep nor feel dejection, 
Suffering's over in the grave ; 
But at the glorious resurrection, 
We'll meet with Him who died to save 
UNDER THE DAISIES 
i'VE just been learning the lesson of life, 
The sad, sad lesson of loving, 
And all of its powers for pleasure or pain 
Been slowly and sadly proving; 
knd all that's left of the bright, bright.dream, 
With its thousand and brilliant phases, 
is a 
handful of dust, in a 
coffin hid— 
A 
coffin under the daisies, 
.he beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And thus forever throughout this wide world 
Is love a 
sorrow proving, 
There are still many sorrowful things in life, 
But the saddest of all is loving; 
Yhe life of some is worse than Death, 
For fate a 
high wall oft raises, 
And far better than life with two heartA 
Is a 
low grave stared with daisies, 
The beautful, beautiful daisies, 
TN: snowy, snowy daisies. 
And so 
better we liv'd as we did, 
The summer of love together, 
And that one sat us tired and lay down to re. 2 
Ere the coming of wintry weather; 
For the saddest of love is love grown cold, 
And 'Us one of Its surest phases, 
So I 
bless my .ot, though with breaking heart. 
For that grave enstarr-d 
witit daisies, 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
WE ARE THE MEN FOR THE PLACE. 
Written and sung by HARRY and JOHN KERNELL. 
No doubt you have heard of the Delanies, 
The men who were tall, lank, and lean; 
They were the smartest men ever left Wexford town, 
And the biggest liars that ever were seen; 
They came to America on a 
horse's back, 
And on the ocean with a 
ship ran a 
race. 
I
r:sPOKEN.—And if you want two men that cart walk one hun. 
, 
A 
miles in the short space of twenty-four hours, we are the 
. 
can do it. 
We can sing, dance and outwhistle any other 
1 
from the same county in Ireland; and don't forget that if 
d 
want governors or constables, or two men that can vote 
....ve times in every ward on election day, send for us. 
We 
can clean out a 
first-class lunch table in ten minutes. 
I 
tell 
you we are the bone and sinew of the Democratic party, and 
we can pull more planks from under the Democratic party than 
any other two men from Maine to the Pacific slope, and if you 
intend opening a 
saloon, send for us; if you intend opening a 
a 
jail, you can bet we are the men for the place. 
CHORuS. 
We are the men for the place, 
We are the men for the place; 
With a 
shovel or pick, 
Or two rale Irish Micks, 
We are the men for the place. 
When we came to America, long ago, 
And stepped on your great Union land, 
It was us that started the first hand organ, 
And opened the first peanut stand; 
We were the originals of the ten cent balloon— 
Tom Collins put a 
stamp on your face. 
SPOKEN.—And if you want a 
couple of actors to play in Jack 
Shepard, we are the men for the place.

I'M in love wi h 
such a 
charming little man, 
A 
musican in the military band, 
And I 
love him better far han gold or wealth, 
When I 
see him in his uniform so grand. 
The first time that I 
met him, 
With : ove I 
was struck dumb, 
And my he • rt was in a 
flutter, 
When Charley played the drum. And its 
C
HORUS. 
One, two, three, with his sticks on the drum, 
Rap-a-t 
o-dle-tum-tum, my sugar plum, 
Oh ! my; but I 
tell you it's fun, 
When Charley plays the drum. 
Oh! he often comes to take me for a 
walk, 
And we stray along together side by side, 
And so sweetly and so lovi gly he'll talk, 
And once he ask'd me if I'd be his bride. 
And ev ry Thuisday evening, 
As soon as work is done, 
I 
hasten to the park to hear 
My Charley play the dr,nn. And it's 
I'VE been waiting for more than an hour, love, 
Yes, waiting and watching for thee, 
While hoping and praying you'd come, love, 
And keep true your promise to me; 
For, you told me you'd meet me this evening, 
And listen to what I've to say— 
For, to speak the plain truth, I 
am certain 
I 
can't tell you all in a 
day.

By the lilies that float down the river, 
By the cowslips that grow on the lea, 
By the roses that bloom in the forest, 
I'm waiting, my darling for thee, 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
rin waiting, my darling, for thee; 
I'm waiting, yes, waiting, 
I'm waiting, my darling, for thee. 
For more than a 
year I 
have waited, 
That promise from you to receive; 
So surely you'll not break your word, love, 
And leave me your absence to grieve. 
So I'll watch and I'll wait here still longer, 
In hope of your coining this way, 
When the dim, misty vail of the twilight 
Hat, 
shut out the brightness of day.

STOKES' VERDICT. 
Written and sung by WtniAANt J. 
SCANLoN. 
Ain.—"Never Go Back on the Poor." 
If you 11 listen awhile, Ill sing you a 
song 
About this "glorious land of the free," 
And the " difference" I'll show ' twixt the rich and the poor, 
In a " trial by the jury," you see. 
If you've plenty of " stamps," you can hold up your head, 
And walk out from your own prison door, 
But they'll hang you up high if you ' ve no friends or gold---
Let the " rich" go, but hang up the poor! 
CHORUS. 
In the trials for murder we ' ve had now- a- days 
The rich ones get off swift and sure, 
While they've thousands to pay to the jury and judge, 
You can bet they'll go back on the poor! 
Let me speak of a 
man who ' s 
now dead in his grave---
A good man as ever was born--
:Tim Fisk, he was called, and his money he gave 
To the outcast the poor and forlorn. 
We all know he loved both women and wine, 
But his heart it was right, I 
am sure; 
Though he lived like a " prince" in a 
palace so fine, 
Yet he never went back on the poor! 
Cnonus. 
If a 
man was in trouble, Fisk helped him along 
To drive the ' grim wolf'' from the door ; 
lie strove to do right, though he may have done wrong, 
But he never went back on the poor! 
Jim Fisk was a 
man, wore his heart on his sleeve," 
No matter what people would say, 
And he did all his deeds ( both the good and the bad) 
in the broad open light of the day, 
r•TOKES'" VERDI ur.---Continued.] 
With his grand " six- in-hand" on the beach at Long Branch, 
He cut a " big dash" to be sure, 
But " Chicago's great fire" showed the world that Jim Fisk, 
With his " wealth," still remembered the poor ! 
Cnonns. 
When the telegram came that the homeless that night 
Were starving to death, slow but sure, 
His " Lightning Express," manned by noble Jim Fisk, 
Flew to feed all her hungry and poor! 
Now what do you think of this " trial" of Sto,kes, 
Who murdered thi; friend of the poor? 
When such men get free, is there anyone safe 
If they step from outside their own door? 
Is there one law for the poor and one for the rich ? 
It seems so, at least so I 
say; 
If they hang up the poor, why---damn it!--- the rich 
Ought to swing up the very same way! 
Crioncs. 
Don't show any favor to friend or to foe, 
The beggar or prince at his door, 
The big millionaire you must hang up also, 
But never go back on the poor. 
Oh, shame on this " land of the free and the brave," 
When such sights as this meet our eye? 
The poor in their prisons are treated like slaves 
While the rich in their cells they live high. 
A poor devil, " crazy with drink," they will hang 
For a 
murder he did n't intend, 
But a 
wealthy assassin, with " political friends," 
Gets off, for he's money to spend! 
Cnorxs. 
But if things go on this way, we ' 11 stand id no more; 
The people will rise up in bands ; 
A Vigilance Committee we ' 11 raise on our shore, 
And take the law in our own hands! 
Write Me a 
Letter from Home. 
Lonely I 
sit me and weep— 
Weep as I 
have not for years; 
Why do mine eyes fail to keep 
Back these affectionate tears? 
I 
think of dear ones over the sea, 
Who love me wherever I 
roam; 
Oh ! go to them, tell them for me 
To write me a 
letter from home. 
CrIORGS. 
Ilave they forgotten me now! 
Or do they expect me to come? 
No, no, go and tell then for me, 
To write me a 
letter from home! 
I 
think of the old-fashioned cot, 
I've left it for many a 
year— 
The last words ; God bless you ! I've got 
From Mother and Father so dear: 
they- hoped that my voyage would he 
A 
pleasant one over the foam ! 
Oh! some one go and tell them for me: 
To write me a 
letter from home 1 
CHORUS.—Have they forgotten me now & c. 
WE PARTED AT THE GATE. 
song and dance written for and sung by Charley Sturgec. 
Composed by Rollin Howard. 
Arlie evening breeze is ebbing low 
A. lullaby to- day 
I 
have a 
quest,ion I 
would ask 
Before it dies away. 
The pebbles on the beach are dry 
The tide has sunken low; 
A 
little form is standing near 
Between the ebb and flow. 
CHORUS. 
She's just a 
roguish little dear, 
And it was not very late 
As she whispered " yes !" and sbed a ! e,i1 
As we parted at the gate. 
A little heart that longing waits 
To know what next twill hear, 
A little face that shyly looks 
To st e 
if still I'm near. 
Ah ! little heart that whispered, " Yes," 
Though pouting lips said, " No," 
You thought that you'd be asked again 
Between the ebb and flow. 
A little face half frightened when 
I 
turn to go away, 
Two little hands that shyly reach 
As if to bid me stay; 
A little voice that softly says, 
I 
did not meati,that " No ;" 
A little pride that well was lost 
" 
Between the ebb and flow."

You will tell me little darling 
If you dearly love me yet. 
When the daisie's dot the meadow 
Shall we dearest, meet again 
Will the summer zephyrs kiss us 
When we wander down the lane ? 
Long ago we met and parted 
In the golden pastures bright. 
And since then my little darling 
Time has quickly taken flight 
In the soft &c. 
When in Heaven with the Angels 
Shall we, dearest, meet again, 
Will we climb the hill together 
To the land that knows no pain? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart, 
And I

There we'll meet to never part.

MY NIGHT OFF, 
Written by Sem. SERTREW. 
Arm —" Immensicoff." 
Some like to stroll in Central Park 
To pass the time away, 
Some like to promenading go 
To see the styles so gay, 
And some at home the time employ 
And never venture forth, 
But I'm the boy that's full of joy 
When I 
have my night oft 
Spoken. — Yes, with a 
five cent shine upon my shoes, a 
dollar or two in my pocket, l'nt just about as happy as 
they make ' em, when my work is done and I 
have the 
pleasure of being informed that— 
CHORUS. 
It's my night off, 0, my night off, 
I'm always gay on my night ofr, 
0, that's my style when I 
go forth, 
I'm one of the boys on my night off. 
All dressed up in my pretties now, 
0, I'm a 
happy cove. 
Then off to promenade I 
go 
And take my turtle dove, 
The peanut stands we patronize, 
And then to be immense, 
We walk up by Dehnonico's 
Regardless of expense. 
Spoken. — Yes, 1 
always feel so happy when I am out 
with my sweet girl, Amelia. 
There's nothing mean about 
me. I 
bought her ten cents worth of chestnuts the other 
and gave a 
bootblack $2 
to carry them home for her 
and she said " Why, Montague, how reckless you are with 
your wealth." I 
says, well you know my darling— 
(Chorus). 
My love is such a 
charming girl 
I 
takes her everywheres, 
She isn't pretty, but she's good, 
And never puts on airs, 
Instead of spending money now 
To make a 
show and dress, 
She goes around among the poor 
Relieving their distress. 
,5poken. — Yes, and she's got such a 
nice way of coming 
around you and making you do just what she says, and 
the other night while walking out she seemed so very 
happy I 
asked her what made her so jubilant, she says : 
"I gave a 
poor man something to eat to-day and if you 
could have seen how he enjoyed the food and how the big 
tears rolled down his cheeks when he thanked me, and— 
and—and— there's a 
poor woman with six children that 
lives around the corner and they haven't got anything to 
eat in the house, and I know where there's two little 
orphans ain't got no shoes to wear and it's awful cold 
weather," and then she commences to blubber and says 
[MY 
NIGEIT OFF.— Continued.] 
it's awful, and I 
blubber and say its dreadful, and then I 
hand her my pocket book and then she smiles and then I 
smile, and we both feel so happy that we scream rilOit 
out with joy, and somebody asks me why I 
am so happy 
and I 
tell them. 
(Chorus). 
The other night I 
met some friends, 
Old times we did recall, 
And sung and danced the whole night long, 
'Till sleep came over all, 
I 
dream't the good old times had come 
Once more with us to dwell, 
But when I 
woke up in the morn 
I 
found my dream a cell," 
4oken.—Yes, I 
was sold, my dream ended in a " cell," 
four by two. I 
was then brought before a Judge and 
asked if I 
had anything to say why I 
shouldn't get six 
months for disturbing the peace by singing " The Star 
Bangled Spanner," and in answer to his ' terogatives 
remarked that it

We march down the street with colors gaily flying. 
Our forms and style so neat sets all the girls a

I'll leave to you to guess.

To see her I 
did go, 
I 
know right well that she loves me, 
Because she told me : 
I 
asked her if she'd be mmiv wife. 
She blushed and answered " yes." 
kissed her lips and named the day, 
And that you'll have to guess.

ALL THE WORLD TO ME. 
Written by ROBERT W ORDEN, of W ORDEN k MACK, 
Oh! I 
know a 
grove of stately poplar trees. 
That whisper in the sunlight soft and low, 
And gently lend their branches to the breeze, 
And often there to meet my love I 
go; 
She greets me with a 
loving smile, 
And welcomes me with voice both low and sweet, 
We sit and talk the while, 
And count the daisies growing ' neath our feet.

And Mien the :•,.)• niimer time lints passed and gone, 
And Winter spreads its mantle o'er the earth, 
And the poplar trees are bare and gaunt and Wall, 
marry then in 
pearl of priceless worth; 
For she has promised to be mine, 
Ancl share with me her future life and love, 
I've pledged her oft in rnI, ,,

We'll live as happy it 
the turtle dove. 
She's pure, (AC. 
Poetry by BOBBY N EWCOMB. 
AS sweet as the rose is she, 
So charming in form and in pace, 
Tier eyes they have pierced my heart through, 
And I 
constantly dream of her face. 
He voice is as clear as the lark, 
That sings with the rising of the day, 
Her breath is as fragrant and sweet 
As the white blossomed flowers of May. 
CHORUS. 
As sweet as the rose is she, 
Her eyes they sparkle bright, 
Fairer than all to me, I 
think of her day and night. 
There's none in this world so wide, 
Could be the same to me, • 
As the girl I'd call my bride, 
As sweet as a 
rose is she. 
• 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl who has won all my love, 
I'd willingly sacrifice life, 
To call her my own turtle dove. 
But she laughs in my face when I 
speak, 
And when I 
make love says 
I 
shan't," 
Then tells in e 
I 
must her forget, 
And I 
would, but then really I 
can't. 
As sweet as the rose, 47.c. 
As sweet as a 
rose is she, 
The girl for whese hand I 
have sighed, 
The wealth of the world I 
would give, 
If only to call her my bride. 
I 
hove I 
may yet win her hand, 
That would make me so happy for life, 
If I 
do, when I 
meet you again, 
Then toeihaps I 
will show vou my wife, 
As sweet us the rose, &e. 
Sung with great success, by W ILD Si BRADLEY, of Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway, N. Y. 
I'm a 
widow with a 
large family. 
My husband was killed in the war ; 
He enlisted one day for a 
soldger, 
Faith, they murdered my darling agra ; 
From the Goverment I 
receive a 
small pension, 
Which all my family loes share ; 
Faith, it ain't enough to maintain us, 
For I 
have to sell apples and pears ! 
If I 
was a 
man I 
could labor, 
Sure, what can a 
poor woman do ; 
I 
can't stand all day at the wash tub. 
The reason I'll tell now to you ; 
I'm troubled bad with the Rheumaticks, 
And to put up with, many's the cares, 
And that's the reason you see me 
Out here, selling apples and pears. 
There's a 
great many men I 
could marry--
There's Dennis McCarthy, so fat ! 
There's Patsy Marley, a 
sound boy ! 
Faith, he is a 
good Democrat ! 
But they all do object to the children ; 
To marry me, not one of them cares ; 
So I'll let them all go to the divil, 
And stick to my apples and pears!

rin over head and heels in love, 
With a 
darling, charming, pretty octoroon, 
Who swears by all the stars above, 
That I 
to church shall lead her soon. 
And oft at night when stars shine bright, 
And the silver moon in beauty shinas above. 
We meet and walk, with happy talk, 
In all the pretty innocence of love,

HORUS. 
She's my little ruby (

And really quite a 
beauty, 
Then come with me at sunset to the valley, 
For there at twilight is our trysting tree, 
And there I 
meet the girl I 
hope to marry; 
I'm sure that you folks must envy me. 
Of course she's lots of followers, 
That seek her young affections to engage, 
She knows their hearts are hallower 
Than mine, although she's all the rage. 
Her pretty feet are small and neat, 
And then her waltzing is really quite divine. 
Her eyes shine bright like stars at night, 
Quite melt me with their brilliant dreamy shine.

LITTLE BUTTERFLY. 
As sung by JOHNSON & BBTTNO. 
My song is of a 
nice young girl, 
Whose beauty, style and grace. 
I 
know her name, but I 
won't tell ; 
Oh ! 
such a 
pretty little face, 
Oh dear ! I 
sigh as she passes down 
By the shady side of the lane ; 
And the eyes in my head goes rolling around, 
Whenever she passes by. 
CHORDS. 
For she's just as pretty as a 
little butterfly, 
That flies around in the grasses ; 
For she's sweeter to me than pumpking pie, 
Sugar, bread and lasses. 
This little beauty I 
do declare, 
Is sweeter than a 
bo41 of cream ; 
And the folks all say when she passes by. 
That she is the prettiest ever seen. 
Some day or other she'll be mine, 
I 
can see it in her eye : 
And if that day don't ever come. 
I 
will lay me down and die. 
For she's just as pretty, Ltc. 
LITTLE NELLY RAY. 
I 
LOVE a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut- brown hair; 
Her waist it is so slender, and her feet they are so small, 
Of all the girls I 
ever loved my Nelly beats them all. 
CUORUN. 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, charming little Nell, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle; 
Nelly Ray like birds of May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Nelly Ray. 
Her father keeps a 
farmhouse, in a 
village down in Kent, 
And being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went; 
And while a 
strolling through the fields, as on my way I 
roamed, 
It's there I 
met may Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nelly Ray, (te. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright green grass, 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country lass. 
I 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
sat by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride, 
Nelly Ray, Arc. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy v.'s 
shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brightest 
ray. 
Nelly Ray,

STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM. 
Composed and written by W. 11, DELEILA NTT. 
Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep from dancing ; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly- pop—sweet forget- me-not— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar- plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
1
-es, she's a 
basket full of fruit. 
She's my pretty love, she's my turtle dove. 
Her voice is like the music of a }lute, 
And she's just sweet sixteen.

Milk, honey, strawberries and cream (spa.), 
Like the music of a 
happy dream (

She's a 
darling! she's a 
daisy. 
She's A 
lovely plate of peaches. 
She's a 
dandy—lasses candy— 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Repent C./corns. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By- a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie, she's a 
chicken pie, 
And she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's a 
lemonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapes, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Oh! yes, she's far too sweet to live. 
Is this lolly pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
sweet vision of my dream.

THE LITTLE ONES AT I
-10IVIE. 
As sung with great snecoss by GEo. W . W ANIIALEIL, 
I 
arn thinking now of home among my native hills, 
And thou ,li afar through distant lands I 
roam, 
The memories of the past my heart with longing fills, 
To see the darling little ones at home, 
All ! now their forms I 
seem to see. 
Far o'er the rolling ocean's foam, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
Oh ! 1 
long to ; ee the little ones at home. 
CHORES. 
The little ones at home, the little ones at home, 
I 
lowg to see the little ones at home, 
And hear their voices ringing in merry childish glee, 
Oh ! 1 
long to see the little ones at home. 
LAST TIME. 
Soon shall I 
hear yorr voices in merry childish glee, 
Proclaim the joyous welcome welcome home. 
The moon looks mildly down the same as oft before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light, 
but its beams are not so bright upon this lonely shore, 
As they seemed at home one year ago to night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I 
may chance to roam, 
J 
hear your voices ringing in merry childish glee ; 
Oh ! I 
long to see the little ones at home. 
The little ones at home, etc. 
May onardian angels still their vigils o'er thee keep, 
May heaven's choicest blessings on thee rest, 
Till I 
am safely borne across the stormy deep, 
And meet again with those I 
love the best. 
Soon, soon your faces I 
shall see, 
Never, never more from thee to roam, 
Soon shall I 
hear your voices in merry childish glee 
Proclaim the joyous welcome, welcome houte. 
PARODY. 
Written by Sitf, , 
Allt. -" The -Water Mill." 
Listen to the lager beer all the live long day, 
Buzzing in its little keg, mad to get away, 
Bushing reckless in the glass when you turn the peg, 
Never coming back again to that lager keg, 
Then this reckless lager beer comes to grief at last,

has passed. 
Many are the schooners now, Johnny, you and 
We have got away with, 0, when our lips were dry, 
A 
ntl the happy times we've had with our friends so gay, 
Shaking for this lager beer and seeing who should pay, 
But those happy times are gone I 
am broke at last, 
The keg will never buzz again with the lager that 
has passed. 
Take this lesson to yourself every one of you, 
Always look before you leap, that's the way to do, 
Don't be like this lager keg, rushing to the brink, 
Gobbled by some Dutchman then thirsting for a 
drink 
When you've got a 
good thing now keep it, clinch it 
fast, 
The keg will never buzz again with the lager that 
has passed.

I 
KNOW a 
little maiden, fair and .oung, 
The most bewitching creature in the village; 
Her face is like a 
garden of !lowers newly sprung, 
And 1ie dwells within a 
li tie rustic cot age. 
There may be other maidens just as fair, 
With the same bright, winsome, happy ways; 
But none have eyes half so iovely, 
Such a 
sweet, bewitching gaze. 
Oh, yes; she is a 
beauty, 
So loving, kind anti true, 
And the only girl to suit me, 
WitO her laughing eyes so blue. 
That's why I'm always happy, light and gay; 
Because, you see, my heart with love . s 
laden; 
Cupid came and drove dull care away 
The day I 
met this pretty little maiden.

BIG FAT NANCE. 
Original Act by BRADLEY and W ILD. 
WHITE folks give me your attention, 
While I'll sing to you my song, 
'Tis of my girl I'm going to mention, 
And I

I've been courting her for many a 
day, 
And to her house I

In her stocking feet she stands 6 
feet 4, 
And weighs three hundred and fifty pounds.

Her father feels quite satisfied, 
Next Sunday eve I'll take her arm, 
And to the church we both shall glide.

Kell never go back on George Lapelle, 
Until the very day she dies.

American Forttinc-Telling Cards.—This is rue old-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr nged and printed in series—Els arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spa des—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10, 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
inclosed in handsome case

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
meet a 
want fiequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of C,rls will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of qesstions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two piayers, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when arta 
miters to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the nk-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting."

book, bound in Morocco leather, costing '.wenty-five cents, called the

" Little Flirt," published by A. J. Fisnxit, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modua operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recom-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
