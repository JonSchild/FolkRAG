M: Well, do you remember there used to be so much snow?
W: Not too much here. Not too much in uh Tennessee, but in North Carolina I remember
going to school and uh my mother used to knit stockings for herself, (uh-huh) wool
stockings. That's back when I was a child, you know. (uh-huh) And that was way before
people quit doing things like that. Well, she, after the feet begin to wear out, but they'd
just make good leggings for children, you know, (uh-huh) those stockings, those wool
stockings just turned the snow, and I remember going to school and the snow's so deep
that she'd put those wool stockings on every one of us, so that it, it'd be, make like
leggings, you know, (uh-buh) turn the snow off. It was bad up there. 'S real snowy and bad
in North Carolina, up at Asheville. See, right there in the mountains.
M: Uh-huh. And how deep would it get?
W: Oh, it'd get up to our knees.
M: Hmm
W: Yeah, just every so often we'd be knee deep, and the schoolhouse wasn't too far away
from us, but it was far enough that we had to be protected, you know. (uh-huh) And we'd

get out in it. I can remember that. But now down here, they's just been a few times, when
my children was little, we had a sled, and my husband and I'd get out with them early in
the morning and, and ride down the hill, <gap> to the barn, and uh the snow, uh the snow
would be four or five inches, you know, four or five inch, but we didn't, we never did have
such big heavy snows here. (uh-huh) My son lives in, in Ohio now, and he tells me that
they's three feet of snow on his roof for a month, a month at a time, you know, up there.
M: Uh-huh. I know. I've only seen that much snow on the news. (uh-huh) I've never seen
it here, but I don't think I want to either. (No.) You never got out of school though, did you,
when it snowed that much?
W: Huh?
M: Did you ever get out of school like the children do now?
I didn't hear you.

M: Uh-huh.
W: No, they didn't have such a thing back then. They just taught straight on and, and
if you could get there, you got there, and if you couldn't, you just didn't. Uh I remember
uh, uh the ne-, our teacher lived close to us. She was ari-, an aristocrat, (uh-huh) and
they'd come from up in New York or somewhere and they were highly educated, all the
sisters. They's three sisters, (uh-huh) and a brother or two, and they were highly educated
(deleted) and they came, they came to Asheville to live because there's milder climate, you
know, from New YOrk. Well, they all just worked into schools, you know. They were smart
and they taught school, and uh the children would manage to get there. I don't know how.
I, I remember that, wading through that snow, but they didn't have snow days up there as,
as I remember it. And, of course, that was a long time ago. (uh-huh) I was ten years old
when we moved down here, so that was when I was between six and ten, you see, that uh
all this stuff that I can remember about the country school.
M: What would you do, would there be some games or other recreation you'd have when
it snowed. Say the children in the nieghborhood, what, would you sled or what would you
do?
W: Yeah, my, yes. One boy got his back broken. A neighbor of ours got his back broken
sledding. It was a big steep hill behind our home and uh they, they'd take sleds up there
and, and uh sled. And this boy got his back broken and for years he was, was crippled,
you know.
M: Uh-huh. I can remember L#22-4 is telling about <unintelligible text> death.

W: Well, now, we had a <unintelligible text> boy that they, he was sledding down off that
hill, and he was, he was a twin. They were twin boys, and they were just real cute boys,
you know. And he was sledding, and they, and he was, got too fast and he went into a, a
water
M: Hydrant?
V1113-3
W: Hydrant, yeah, and crushed his brain, you know. Killed him.
M: Hum. They can go pretty fast sometimes.
W: Uh-huh. His twin brother's still living down there,<unintelligible text> boy.
M: Children play dangerously. I can remember a couple of weeks ago, when they had all
that snow, almost every other night, there was a story in the paper about someone getting
hurt. Uh-huh.
W: Getting hurt.
M: Getting hurt bad.
W: Yeah, I know it. That's right. That's the truth. Well, we always, my husband and I were
with our children, and the man on the place. We, we usually had a, a farmhand on the
place. And they would all be right there with these children when they were riding the sled,

so we took care of 'em ourselves, you know, (uh-huh) so they didn't get into any trouble.
But Law, kids do so many wild things. I remember we had an old buggy out there, and they
got to pulling it up on the hill and riding down and, and that was a dangerous thing, you
know, cause that thing could have run away with 'em. But they'd steer(??) it up to the side
and keep it from going too far, you know.
M: Uh-huh. What all did your parents do?
W: What did my parents do?
M: Yes.
W: Well, my father, after he moved to Tennessee, why, he was a, he built ro-, roads.
(hmm) He was a contractor, road contractor. He built roads. He, he worked for the
railroad. Built railroad beds for a long time. But then moto-, then he got to working, making
highways, and uh that was what he did. But uh, and my brother was working with him,
and he, he <gap>, he's <unintelligible text> father. My brother is, you know. (uh-huh) And
uh they were road builders. That was what they did. Contractors. And my husband was
a farmer, and for twenty five years I was County Director of Public Welfare here in the
county.
M: Here in Jefferson County?

W: Uh-huh. Yeah.
M: What kind of work did that involve?
W: Hmm?
M: What kind of work did that involve?
W: Well, you know, you know what public welfare is, don't you?
M: Well, I know what it is today.
W: Yeah. Well, that's the same thing. 'Stwenty five years I worked with 'em and I retired in
fifty, in uh, uh fifty eight, I believe. I had worked with 'em from the beginning of the program
until (uh-huh) that, in ninety fifty eight. But uh it, it's entirely, it's outgrown what we had
back in those days, you know. 'Sa lot of, a lot of, they's quite a difference in the way the
investigations are made about the families and all.
M: Uh-huh. What was the most difficult part of it?
W: Well, uh proving eligibility was mainly it, you know. (uh-huh) You'd have to get out and
visit the home and, and find out about their income and so on like that, and uh that was the
main thing that you, and we were very cautious back then cause the, the state didn't have
that much money, you know, and they had the, the government backed up the state to half
and half, I think. (uh-huh) I believe they gave 'em half of it. But there was no investigation,
Uh we didn't, we were so thorough about our investigations that they <gap>, they didn't,

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms6506
the state didn't send people out to investigate us, you know. So it, it was entirely different
then from what it is now.
M: Uh-huh. Nowadays it doesn't seem like they have time or enough people to really
investigate.
W: I know. I know. I know that's what they claim, but they's things go on right around, you
uh, people will tell you things if, if you know how to get their confidence. They'll tell you
things. Now they, they's a man that came here and painted my house and he was telling
me about uh a woman that lived in a trailor, or uh lived next door to him. I believe it was
next door to him. And her husband, ex-, he was supposed to be uh, uh

gone from home, but he spent the nights in her trailer and, and lived in, he spent the nights
in her home and lived in a trailer just a little piece away. (uh-huh) Well, now we would have
found that out back in our, when we were investigating, (uh-huh) cause we'd uh, we, we
were ta-, ta-, taught to dig in (uh-huh) until you found things out,you know.
M: Uh-huh. Do you remember when TVA came and put in Douglas Lake (uh-huh) what the
reaction of the local people was?
W: Well, they, they blamed it on Roosevelt. Hahaha. These Republicans down in
Dandridge (uh-huh) just got rich from what the, they paid 'em for their land, the farms.
(hmm) All those people along that lake just got gorgeous sums of money, and uh oh, they

afc1986022.afc1986022_ms6506
just blamed it on Roosevelt, though. Blamed it on Roosevelt, the whole thing. But they
hauled, I saw 'em go by our office, they hauled uh springs from that spring factory over
Jefferson City (uh-huh) to put in a cave down there when they were building that dam,
to catch the concrete, those springs back in there? (uh-huh) If that ever did break loose,
it would be something else. It, they did, that cave, the caves on each side of that dam
down there (uh-huh) were filled with springs, and I guess concrete, you know, and when
the springs caught the concrete, I don't know how it was done, but just truck-load after
truckload of springs went by while they was fixing that dam. (hmm) And I, I don't know. Uh
I just wonder sometimes if it'll ever, if it'll ever break loose and. Be an awful thing, wouldn't
it, all this water that's backed up there, you know.
M: It would. It would. I've heard there was a lot of resentment, though, toward TVA back
during tha t time.
W: Uh-huh. Yeah.
M: Was there?
W: But the, but the ones that were, were grumbling bout it were the ones that got rich from
selling their property to the government. They just got fantastic prices for their land. (hmm)
And they, poor old Roosevelt was blamed for everything, you know. Ha! And this is a very
Republican county now. I don't know whether you know that

or not, but it is.
M: Oh, I know it. And so is Knoxville.
W: Yeah, yeah. Very, very Republican county.
M: I don't think there's any way #64-8 <unintelligible text> and about Republicanism. But
someone was telling me there are about as many Democrats in White Pine as there are
REpublicans.
W: Well yes. We've had a, a Democrat, my father was the first mayor of White Pine and uh
he had an awful tim e trying to get the town incorporated. (hmm) You know, a town's not
worth anything unless it's incorporated and, and so he just kept trying that, he was from
the city of Asheville and, and he had been in politics in Asheville, (uh-huh) and so he was
the first mayor in White Pine. So uh we've always, it's always been about half and half up
there, half Republican and half Democrat in the city. (uh-huh) Now, we've had uh, oh, I
guess we've had, nearly all our mayors have been Democrat. Uh this Ballance boy, who
retired last, uh resigned, (uh-huh) he was a Republican. But Mr. <unintelligible text> was
re-, was uh the mayor for years and, and he's a Democrat, (uh-huh) and uh, we, we've uh
we've had several Democrats. I think mostly Democrats have been the mayors of White
Pine. White Pine itself is Demo-, Democratic, I believe.
