The BridgewaterNear a bridgewater a rich man liveth.He had two sons and one daughter dear,And
through life to death, he was resolved thenTo bring them up in the hearts of fear.Unto the seas
these two boys ventured,For to bring home their father gain;An apprentice bound by a firm
indentureFor to cross o'er the raging main.Now, this young man had a fair complexion,He was
neat and handsome in every limb,And on him their sister placed her affection,But un-beknownst
to any of them;Except unto the youngest brotherWho chanced to hear them sport and play.And
this he told unto no other,But to his brother he did say,"Now, perhaps he may be of some low
family,And would like our sister for to have,But we'll soon end him of his wishes,And quickly send
him to his grave."Near a bridgewater all went a-huntingWhere harmless birds do sport and play.In
a lonely wood not much frequented,They did this young man's body slay.When they came home,
their sister asked themWhat they had done with the servant man."We tell you plainly, we were
offended,And for your future a better plan"In a lonely wood near a bridgewater,He'll soon forget our
sister dear.We lost him in a game of hunting,And never more we could him hear."That very night as
she lay sleeping,She dreamed her true love came and stoodBy her bedside, and appearingCovered
o'er in a gore of blood. 2 2 of 2The BridgewaterSaid he, "My sweet, my emris jewel,'Tis a true folly
for thee to pine,Since your two brothers have been so cruel;In such a place you may me find."Then
she rose most bright and early,And traveled all alone, alone,Until she came to the bridgewater.There
she found him killed and thrown.The tears were dried up on his pale cheeks;His eyes were salt as
any brine.She kissed him over and ten times over,Saying, "Oh, this bosom friend of mine!"Three days
and nights she stayed a-weeping,All alone, alone, alone,Until she felt fierce hunger creeping,Which
forced her for to go home.When she came home, her brothers asked herWhat made her look so pale
and wan.She said, "The reason, you've acted treasonIn killing of your servant man."And I suppose
you think I'll conceal this murder,But I'll do no, no such a thing.But for his sake,Both of you have got
to swing."Now they were both confined in prison,And both of them condemned to die.And she her
true love is lamentingAnd yielding up herself to die.
