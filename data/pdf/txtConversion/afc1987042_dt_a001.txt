S:  [First sentence is muffled-cannot transcribe]  So it's not an island now.  They still call it Duck 
Island Treatment Plant, you know, (D:  Right) because this used to be Duck Island.  And I used to
come down here once a year fishing when I had a small boat.  And I had, and I had a canoe.  I 
had a canoe for the last thirty years.  I came down here once a year and put my boat in and fish 
and always catch a few bass here.  Nothing tremendous, but once about maybe fifteen years ago, 
before just really starting to build this, I caught one about five pounds.  That was the biggest I 
have ever caught here.  But over the years it used to be down there you could cast and I used 
braided nylon, or braided linen line with  bait cast and [unclear] reel.  And you would be reeling 
in and you would have toilet paper and everything else on the line, [laughs] you know?  Not just 
toilet paper, I mean you would have everything.  So I had to go home and take a garden hose and
rinse my rod and reel off, you know?  But once a year I would come down and try, because I had 
talked to a biologist and he had told me, I still, I believed him, but I didn't go along with it.  He 
said, "if you catch any fish out on the river, he said, they are edible."  Even though the river was 
considered polluted, you know, (D:  Umhm) but I said, "well", you know, it sounded okay, but I 
still couldn't make myself eat them.  Although they were clean looking fish.  They were a good 
looking fish.  They looked as good as any out of the nice clear ponds that we have around here 
(D:  Umhm) and we have some tremendous ponds around here as far as bass is concerned.  
Trout, it is mostly a put and take proposition.  The state stocks them and then guys go out and 
fish them and take them out, but there are a few ponds where they have holdovers, what they call
holdovers and they do grow to a much bigger size and let's get out and see.  [Can hear the river 
and the boat in the background]  I don't know, I think there's probably too much foliage.  You 
may be able to take some pictures if you want there (D:  Okay) of this particular area.
I haven't been here for awhile, so I really don't know whether (--) Just in case we get out of [few 
words unclear].  (D:  Okay)  I have had some bad experiences.  [Sentence unclear]  I have been 
ripped off a couple of times bad.  (D:  Oh yeah)  I have been jumped a couple of times.
D:  Down in here?
S:  Not right here.  [Lots of traffic noise in background]  Don't think I'm paranoid now, I'm not, 
because there is nobody who is going to jump me again.  
D:  Yeah.
S:  I just was fortunate to get out of it [unclear].  Both times it was at night. (D:  Yeah)  So you 
are not going to be able to see anything.  I thought maybe (--)  Do you want to take a look under 
the rock, (D:  Okay) or do you want to go to the pond?  This is a nice section of the river here.  
See, the water comes down and it swirls around in here.  There's a small island out there and it 
swirls around in here.  Now when the, if the salmon, if they ever let them come up, see, right 
now they are not letting them come up.  They are bringing them up the elevator and they are 
putting them in a [unclear].  I guess they let one or two go without anybody knowing it.  And 
they made it all the way up to, one was caught in Manchester.  I understand [few words unclear] 
one was caught in Lowell, but I heard another one was caught up in Manchester.  I heard another 
one made it up to the (Pemagwaset?), (D:  Umhm) East Manchester.  No, we ain't going to go up 
there, you'd get soaked.   
D:  Okay.  Now we are on the Lowell/Dracut line right now?
S:  This is the Lowell/Dracut line right here, yeah.  And this is as far as Lowell goes with the 
Merrimack River.  Then Dracut, then the next town is Methuen, and the next town is Lawrence.  
And Lawrence is where they have at the Essex Dam, the power company down there built an 
elevator (D:  Umhm) with funds from the government.  (D:  Right)  I don't know [few words 
unclear].
D:  Now if you were going to fish down here and someone said, where you were going, what 
term would you use to tell people where you are fishing?
S:  Right here?
D:  Yeah.
S:  Well, right here I would say down at Duck Island.
D:  Duck Island?
S:  Treatment Plant, yeah.  (D:  Yup)  And down here now, you've got, to catch fish here, you will
have shad, herring, (quonpol), (qubees), bass, a few pickerel, calico bass, small mouth and large 
mouth bass.  Now once (--)  Now see, the Concord River comes in right over there, right across.
D:  Right across.
S:  Yeah.  Now out of the Concord River you will get a few trout that will come down from up 
above from the small tributaries that come into the Concord, that the state stocks, and they will 
come down into here.  (D:  Umhm)  And once in awhile somebody will catch a decent trout 
down here. They are not, they don't come down here to go trout fishing.  They come down here 
to go for bass and catfish.  (D:  Umhm)  And when the run is on they will fish for the shad.
D:  People mainly fish from the shore, or from boats right here?
S:  Mostly from the shore.  (D:  Yeah)  It's, there isn't, see, that's one of the things, they don't 
have any launch pads here.  (D:  Umhm)  They have one up above our dam, so you can fish from
the Pawtucket Dam up to the New Hampshire line.  Well further if you have got a New 
Hampshire license, but there is only one public launch ramp there and that is a very small one.  
That is one of the things that we need all over, is launching ramps for people to put their boats in.
Right of ways, access for right of way.  That is what is necessary.  The biggest thing that is 
necessary is for the people that don't belong to organized sportsman clubs to understand how 
they have to react to land owners.  They can't go up to a guy and say, "can I put my boat in 
beside your house"?  And the guy will say, "no" right off the bat, but he has a reason.  (D:  Yeah, 
sure)  He has been plagued by people that give him a bad time for no reason whatsoever.  (D:  
Yeah)  And so then the next guy that comes, he is sick of everybody.  Now you might be a nice 
guy and would go along with anything that the guy would say, but he has been plagued so much 
by people that have, don't, you know, have no common sense whatsoever.  (D:  Umhm)  So that 
is the kind of, that's the kind of people that hurt it for the regular fishermen. (D:  Yeah)  I have 
been very fortunate and I have met a lot of nice people.  They let me leave my canoe here, or my 
boat, or whatever, but all you got to do is talk to them, be nice to them.  You know, once in 
awhile you are going to meet a guy who is aggressive, but he's probably got a reason for it, you 
know.  He's had somebody give him a bad time.  
D:  Yeah, right.  I have found that you treat people well, usually you get it in return.
S:  Ninety-nine percent of the time.  (D:  Yeah)  [Traffic]  I don't mind talking about fishing and 
hunting, because that is my main hobbies.  Well, let's see.  I will take you down and show you 
the Centraville Sportsmen's Club, which is a good organization, but it has nothing to do with 
what really you want to do, is it?
D:  Well I would be happy to see it though, just the same.  (S:  All right, we'll take a right down.) 
We can certainly talk while we are riding.
S:  Okay.  Well it is the kind of organization that we need more of.  We need people.  Like when 
they send out the forms for the licenses and they should have a little notation on them, do you 
belong to a Sportsman's Club?  (D:  Right)  And they should have a little list there of the 
Sportsmen's Clubs in that vicinity that they could join.  (D: Right.)  You know, name and address 
of them, telephone number, something like that.  
D:  Now before I turned the machine on here, you were telling me a little bit about how the club 
was founded.  Could you tell me again how the Centraville Sportsmen's Club got together to 
begin with?  
S:  Oh sure.  Back about 1947, 48, there were a couple of guys by the name of Danny Pritchard 
and Johnny "the Ice Man", let's see, who was the other guy?  [Laughs]  I can't think of the other 
fellows name right off the bat, but they started a little club that was, they called it the "one that 
got away club".  Just some guys that hung around the barroom.  And from that evolved the 
Centraville Sportsmen Club.  A few guys like George McDermott and myself and Eddie Sylesky,
Buddy McDermott, Johnny Green, decided to start a Sportsmen's Club.  And so we sat around 
and had our first meeting and had a pretty good number of guys.  And at the second meeting we 
had a lot more guys.  And pretty soon a lot of people were interested in it.  (D:  Umhm)  So this 
George McDermott, the first president was Al (Cutash), he has now gone by.  And the next 
president was George McDermott.  George was a real good sportsman and dedicated to 
conservation and stuff like that, knew a little bit more than the average guy about it, because he 
was brought up, his father was that type of a man.  Maybe a little bit of a bandit at times back 
then.  [Laughs]  [Unclear] conservation was [unclear].  (D:  Yeah, yeah)  I think we all were 
when we first started out and we didn't know anything about conservation, you know?  Not 
severely, but I mean once in awhile you would break a law, but after you get involved you 
wouldn't think of breaking a law.  And that goes for the majority of young people that I see.  
When I see them out in the field in the streams, I see a lot of them breaking the laws.  And I am 
not afraid to go up and say to them, "hey", you know, let them know what they are doing, but 
you have got to be careful, because some of them would just as soon whack you as look at you, 
you know?  (D:  Yeah, yeah)  You have got to use a little common sense.  
D:  What kind of laws do you mean, like taking too many?
S:  Yeah.  (D:  Yeah?)  Yeah.  For instance, a big majority of places you are not allowed to shoot 
hen pheasants.  And they will shoot a hen and they don't even know what they are doing.  And 
like in some places now, like in this state here, we have some laws that I don't go along with.  
They break up the laws on trout fishing for example.  You can only keep six trout.  Now this is 
only in certain areas now.  You can keep twelve trout, six of which may be ten inches, or better, 
and six of which may be ten inches, or less, (D:  Right) but you can't keep seven that's over ten, 
or seven over, or seven under ten, see?  (D:  Umhm)  Now that's not too confusing, but it's 
confusing enough for this reason, that when they stock, they usually stock the majority of trout at
each bridge that will be all under ten inches.  (D:  Umhm)  So a guy is going to be fishing there 
and a stream has a twelve trout limit, he's going to catch twelve trout and they are all going to be 
under ten inches, or over ten inches, either one or the other.  So as a rule, as a general rule the 
average guy is breaking the law there.
D:  Right.
S:  Then they come up a couple of years ago with another one.  You couldn't take more than two 
brown trout.  Now around here we have three kinds of trout, not counting your lake trout, that is 
a different type.  You only have them in a very few lakes around here in Mass.  There is brooks, 
brook trout, brown trout, and rainbow trout.  Well I would guess and I don't think that I am too 
far off,  I would say that at least 50% of the fishermen that go trout fishing don't know the 
difference between a brown trout, and a rainbow trout and a brook trout.  So when they catch 
three brown trout they are breaking the law.  (D:  Umhm, umhm)  Now I don't think that this was
done intentional.  I don't think that the Fish and Game Department intentionally made that law to
try and catch people to put a little more money in their coffers.  I don't really think it was done 
for that.  I think it was done because brown trout are kind of scarce.  They use to be the most 
popular fish in this state.  And then a big [unclear] came by and killed them right off.  And so for 
the last, I'll give or take a few years, I will say the last ten or twelve years they have had trouble 
raising them, but they are raising them again.  But they were the bigger, they were the bigger 
trout that were stocked, you know, and they were the fun fish to catch, but I got off the subject.  
You wanted me to talk about the Centraville Sportsmen's Club.  [Both laugh]  (D:  That's right)  I
got off the subject when I am talking about fishing.
D:  How many members are there in the club now?
S:  Right now we have got about six hundred members.  (D:  Wow)  Pretty close to six hundred.
D:  And what communities are they from?
S:  Well, they are from all around.  They are from Lowell, Dracut.  We have them from up in 
New Hampshire.  Oh gee wiz.  We have them from all over.  We have them from down as far as 
Woburn, New Hampshire, out in Pepperell, all surrounding towns.  We have a pretty good size 
membership.  Lowell Sportsmen's Club is a much older club than us.  We have our 39th, 40th 
Anniversary coming up for this club.  
D:  Yeah.  What kinds of activities does the club put on?
S:  Well we have a nice bow hunting range with twenty something stations.  We have a trap field.
We have two fishing ponds.  We have an indoor pistol range and we try to run different types of 
things.  For years I ran the trout pool every year.  That was a little money raiser.  Buy the trout 
from a fellow down the Cape by the name of Howard Robbins, who always treated us like a 
jewel.  And another guy all the way from, what's the name?  I should know the name of the town 
he comes from.  I want to say Hyannis, but it is not Hyannis.  Well, they come from all the way 
down the Cape and  he bring us up whatever we, we averagely range from 1000 to 1500 dollars 
worth of trout, but then if we want a couple of hundred dollars worth, he will come all the way 
up with a couple of hundred dollars worth.  A real nice fellow.
D:  You stock your pond and then (--)
S:  We stock a pond and then we charge ten, or twenty dollars depending upon the size of the fish
and the amount.  Then that money goes towards either buying land, or towards whatever we can 
do to promote hunting and fishing.  I even got these guys in this club to donate for a shad truck 
up in the State of New Hampshire.  (D:  Oh yeah)  Now that is unusual, because the states don't 
work together.  That is something that I could never understand.  They always seemed to buck 
heads instead of working together.  (D:  Right)  Most of the Sportsmen want to work together, 
but for some reason the states can't seem to get, that is political.  In my estimation that is 
political.  The politicians just can't seem to get together.  (D:  Well, sometimes (--))  Like 
Dukakis and Sununu now, it's, they're at odds with that Nuclear Plant.  And that is a shame.  (D:  
Yup, yup)  That is a shame that they are at odds for that.
D:  A lot of times the state departments are reluctant to,  well, they only have so much money and
they don't want to carve it up and send it across the state lines.
S:  No, that's true.  Yeah, but if they worked a little bit more together I think they could, I think 
that they could work things out and make things better for both.
D:  Does the club have any kind of fishing contest, or turkey shoots, or anything like that?
S:  Oh yeah, yeah.  They usually (--)  They got a little bit away from the annual turkey shoot.  We
have an annual banquet and they have a Halloween dance and things like that, you know, fairly 
well. I am not as active as I used to be.  (D:  Okay)  This is the club. This is the old club house 
here when we first bought it.  We got 53 1/2 acres here.
D:  Now what road are we on now?
S:  This is Wheeler Road in Dracut.  (D:  Uh huh)  The pond is down pretty bad as you see.  (D:  
Oh yeah)  Take you in and show you the club house.  (D:  Sure)  [As they get out of the car you 
can hear traffic].  This pond doesn't look like much right now, because it is down so bad it seeps 
underneath the ground as over there, see.  (D:  Oh yeah)  And even his pond is down, but that 
water comes right up to the top here, I mean right up to the top, (D:  Yeah) right up to this green 
grass here.  And in spring (--)  So that is a fairly good size pond.  You would be surprised, you 
can get a couple of hundred guys around here and it is a little crowded, but not too bad.  They 
have a heck of a time, because we put so much trout in such a small area that when we say (--)  
We let them start fishing at seven o'clock.  And we say, okay, and everybody goes at once.  (D:  
Laughs) And I'm going to tell you, just about everybody has a fish on, you know.  And it is 
chaos, believe me.
D:  They fishing flies?
S:  Anything they want.  Anything, any legal, any legal means of fishing we let them fish with.  
We don't care what they use as long as it is a legal means to fish.
D:  That must be exciting.
S:  See these trees here?  (D:  Yeah)  Those are Colorado Spruce.  My youngest daughter and I 
planted those about, those trees are right now, let's see, she was thirteen, about fourteen, fifteen 
years old now.  They are doing pretty good from, you know,  only this little, what do they call 
them, striplings, when we bought, when we planted them.  (D:  Yeah, yeah, they must be)  We 
planted fifty-six.  There are about, I think about twenty-eight to thirty-two of them left.
D:  They must be forty or fifty feet high now.
S:  Yeah, they are up there pretty good.  (D:  Yeah, I think they look pretty good).  The only thing
that bothered me was for a number of years we had guys coming out here Christmas, stealing the
Christmas trees.  (D:  Yes, oh yes)  Like I say, there is only about thirty-two left.  And they 
topped a few.  You can see some of them where they are still small where they topped them, (D:  
Yeah, yeah) but you know they actually grew up.  Even after they topped them they came back 
again.  They came back fairly well.  And we have a little pond on the other side of that, this little 
[unclear] is connected to it.
D:  Now when you have these um, what do you call them?
S:  Fishing derbies.
D:  Yeah.  Do you have them at the same time of year every year?
S:  Yes, usually in the spring, shortly after ice-out, (D:  Umhm) preferably April.  Sometimes we 
still have ice here in April, so we have to wait till March, but then we will usually, we'll usually 
run, I have run them for the retarded children of Lowell.  The mentally (--)  What do they call 
them?  The Special Children, (D:  Right) Special Needs Children and the Greater Lowell Boys 
Club.  And I will tell you, it does your heart good to see those kids catch those fish.  They really 
enjoy it.  [Laughs]  
D:  It sounds exciting.
S:  You know, it never cost us that much.  We spend probably $200 or $300 dollars buying the 
fish and the food for them, (D:  Right) but they really enjoy it.  They have a good time.  [Hear 
traffic]
Oh, it was locked.
D:  Oh, this is a big place.
S:  It is not bad club house, except we have no lights.
D:  The power shut off or something?
S:  Maybe.
D:  How often do you have meetings here?
S:  Once a month, (D:  Yeah) regularly.  Yeah, the power is off.  Yeah, once a month they have a 
regular meeting.  They have uh,  I use to have the week before the [unclear], I use to have the 
Board of Directors [unclear] meeting, but now they have it the week after for some reason.  Oh 
yeah, the power is off.  It must be this part of Dracut.  Our power plant is in the back here.  (D:  
Uh huh) That is the bar.  That is the only thing that they hid on the charter.  It was in the charter, 
no alcoholic beverages.  (D:  Oh yes.  Uh huh)  They kind of got around that a little bit.  I want to
see if they shut anything off here.
D:  Okay, sure.  Do you rent out the club house to other groups at all?
S:  We let certain groups use it.  We don't rent it out.  Ed was always against renting it out.  He 
ran into trouble once in awhile like that.  We let certain groups use it.  Like we let the Boy Scouts
come out here and use the grounds and everything.  Different organizations, depending upon if 
they are non-profit organizations and do, for a good cause.  We try to be as reciprocal as we can, 
you know?  The farmer down there, he used to let us use that [unclear], (D:  Yeah) but he died.  
Now look at the size of those mushrooms up there under the tree.  (D:  Wow, yeah, giants)  I 
know some people that would love those.  I don't know if they are good
ones.  There are some big ones that are good and some big ones that aren't good.  [Both laugh] 
D:  Well I play it safe and leave them all alone.
S:  Well I do too, I don't touch them, but I had a friend that knew them.  His mother and father 
came from Yugoslavia, or some place like that.  (D:  Oh yeah)  And they taught him how to pick 
the right ones, you know.  You are probably not interested in looking at the grounds, huh?
D:  Take a look as we go by here.
S:  Road out there, that just goes out (--)  All kinds of blackberry bushes down here and grapes 
up here.  This road just goes back for about half a mile and there is a couple of fields up there.
D:  Now you said you had a trap shooting range.
S:  Trap shooting range out there and there is another one right over there.  (D:  Umhm)  We got 
two trap shooting ranges. We don't have skeet.  We just have trap.
D:  Right.  And you said there was a bow hunting range too?
S:  Yeah, it starts right over in here and it goes right up there and up through the woods and all 
the way up to the other field and across the other field and around.  They had, they had about 
sixteen positions first and now I think they got something like thirty-two.  Whatever, I am not 
sure, because I don't bow hunt anymore.  I got the arthritis and I, I couldn't pull the bow, I 
dropped it down.  I had a sixty pound pole and I could handle that and it dropped down to 
fifty-five and then down to fifty and I had problems with the arthritis, so I said, I had to stop it.
D:  Is this bow range like a target range?  Is that how it works?
S:  Yeah.  Yeah, they set up targets throughout the woods.  So you are walking along and there is 
your target.  They have them anywhere's from I guess twenty yards up to probably, probably 
eighty yards.  I am not, I'm not right up on that, but I know the archers have a good time down 
there.  And they have these shoots that they, they had the organized [unclear] from all over the 
country.  [Lots of noise from tape]  And they had some shoots and the people come from all over.
And they have a good time.  We usually make a couple of bucks.  (D:  Yup)  Let's see, we won't 
go that way, that one is blocked up.
D:  It is pretty out this way. 
S:  Yeah, this is the town of Dracut.  There used to be tremendous pheasant hunting out here.  We
used to stock pheasant.  We used to raise uh, people used to think we raised three hundred.  We 
had two hundred and sixty, it was always between two hundred and sixty and two hundred and 
sixty-eight birds that we raised.  And you know, we had to stop raising them for one reason.  Too 
many people got to know that we were raising them.  We stocked them all around Dracut.  We 
would take a crate of birds, six birds in a crate and we would stock them.  We never stocked them
near the club.  We always stocked them around and we always stocked them prior to the season 
and we would save a few crates for near the end of the season, but we were really sportsmen like 
about it.  We spread them out as much as we could, gave them a chance to acclimate themselves 
to the area.  (D:  Right)  But you know we had guys, we had guys who would go out and shoot 
them as soon as we released them.  I don't mean our guys either, I mean guys that came from, I 
am not going to name any particular towns, (D:  Sure, sure) but outside of the Lowell,  greater 
Lowell area.  Mostly from down around Boston, I will name that, but they were the type of guys 
that probably only went out a couple of times a year, you know.  (D:  Umhm)  But opening day 
out here in this area you could hardly find a place to park.  It got to that point.  So the farmers 
were a little perturbed and you couldn't blame them.  And then the pay off was, they came one 
year and broke into our pen and killed, I think it was sixty some birds.  (D:  Jeeze)  Unbelievable,
you know, that somebody could do such a thing as that.  (D:  Umhm)  So we stopped, we stopped
raising them.  And you have so much posted land now, there is not that much territory where, and
there's not that many, very few native birds now, but there are native birds in a few of the 
swamps that we have left.  (D:  Umhm) I say native, a lot of them are probably holdovers and 
they got to breed with the wild ones, you know, (D:  right) which has made the survival anyway, 
survival of the fittest as they say, you know.  
D:  Yeah.  (S:  But uh)  Where abouts do you usually go bird hunting generally?
S:  Well, since my dog died I don't do any bird hunting anymore.  They do have these places, the 
state stocks them.  Wildlife Management Areas they call them, WMU's.  I just don't go for them. 
There are plenty of birds there, but you also got a few idiots there.  I shouldn't say that I suppose,
but you are liable to be walking up there and the bird goes up in front of you and the guy is 
standing there and he is going to shoot right at the bird and you are right in his line of fire, you 
know?  So I don't go for that.  (D:  Right)  I do a little deer hunting now and ducking, goose 
hunting, but I do it mostly in New Hampshire.  (D:  Oh yeah)  In New Hampshire you still got a 
lot of land that is not posted.  Like the town of Dracut here, now there is deer around the town of 
Dracut, believe it or not, but you find an area where they are and you go in on that track.  If the 
snow comes, well even if the snow doesn't come, you can still track them if you know a little bit 
(D:  Right) to a point, you know, especially on a rainy day.  But you are tracking them and then 
all of a sudden you are on posted ground, you know, so you are in trouble.  I was stocking three 
of them about two years ago.  The first time I ever got a doe permit too.  I thought I followed 
three right away and they went up behind the clubhouse there.  So I got up behind there and now 
I know I am not supposed to be here, but it wasn't actually posted and I was way in back of the 
clubhouse.  So I knew that was okay, questionable, but I knew it was okay.  (D:  Yeah)  But then 
they crossed our land and they were on Monty's land.  Well I knew Monty's land was posted, so I
just followed them a little ways.  And I remember [unclear] two more came in.  So I was actually
following five deer, but I had to leave them.  You know, that kind of, kind of got me.  (D:  Pretty 
frustrating)  It is, it is.  And of course a lot of the posted land comes from people that move from 
the city out to the country.  Of course in New Hampshire it is ten times worse.  People move 
from New York, Connecticut, all states, and Massachusetts move up there and buy a big lot of 
land, anything from twenty acres to l000 acres and the first thing they do is post their land.  They
don't want anybody around it.  (D:  Yeah)  That hurts.  That's why I've always told people and 
most of the guys that I know, we talk to guys that are starting hunting, young people especially, 
and we tell them to treat those people the way they want to be treated and tell them, if you are 
going on their land and you shoot two pleasant, give them one.  If you shoot a deer off their land,
or you have gone through their land, you shoot a deer, you drag it out, be considerate enough to 
bring them back a roast, or a few chops, or something.  You know, at least offer it too them.  (D:  
Right)  Let them know that you are thinking, you know.  And this does help, believe me it helps. 
Plus another thing, picking up trash.  (D:  Umhm)  Your parking in a spot and you see, you see a 
bunch of stuff, just before you leave pick it up.  Don't take much to keep a garbage bag 
underneath your front seat.  (D:  Yeah)  And pick it up and if the guy happens to see you doing it,
you have made a friend.  Believe me I have made a few friends over the years like that.  Little 
things like that, that count so much.   And I am glad to say that the majority, not all of them, but 
the majority of organized sportsmen, it has been talked to them enough times that they, they stop 
and think before they drive along and throw a coffee cup out the window, or when they are 
fishing throw a six pack of whatever, you know.  Personally I don't need a six pack to go fishing, 
or a shot of booze.  I get, I get as high when I set a hook in a big bass,  (Laughs)  Or see a deer, 
or a pheasant shoot up in front of me I get just as high as the guy taking a double shot of 
whiskey, you know.  I do!  [Laughs]  (D:  Yeah, I believe you)  In fact, the guy that I was fishing 
with, I have been fishing pretty heavily with in the past three years.  We were friends years ago 
and after he retired he started fishing with me.  And I caught the first big bass with him about 
three years ago.  Of course I was shaking like a leaf.  "What the hell are you shaking for"?  [D:  
Laughs)  I said, "what am I shaking for"?  "What do you think I am fishing for?"  I said, "I enjoy 
it!  I said, "I am excited, what the hell do you think"?  He says, "for christ sake you have caught 
l000 bass".  I says, "yeah, I've caught l0,000 bass, probably l00,000 bass, but I said, I still get 
excited when I catch one."  And the bigger he is the more excited I get.  I wouldn't be fishing.  I 
wouldn't like sit there and catch a fish and say, "oh, I caught a fish", you know?  I don't feel that 
way about it.  I feel real good about catching them.  (D:  Yeah)  And then [unclear] pectoral fin 
off.  [Unclear] told me that years ago, that if you want to mark your fish.  So next time I catch 
that fish, I see that right pectoral fin gone, I know I have caught him before.  In fact the biggest 
fish I have caught was nine pounds and two ounces for a large mouth bass, which is a pretty 
good size for around here.  There are not too many people who have caught that size bass around
here.  And so I had it mounted, because he had,  his right pectoral fin only had, they've got like 
five fingers on their right pectoral fin.  I call it five fingers.  (D:  Umhm)  But this one only had 
three left and it was neural, much smaller than the other one, you know, then the left one.  So I 
knew I had caught him before.  But I couldn't tell, I didn't know when, you know?  (D:  Yeah, 
sure)  For awhile I was tagging a fish with a name, they call it a spaghetti tag, yellow tag.  (D:  
Yes, I know what you mean, yeah)  Had my name on it, my telephone number and a number.  
And I use to record the fish.  I would catch the fish and I'd put the tag in and let him go.  And I 
would record the date I caught it, the size of the fish, the length and the weight and the part of the
pond and the name of the pond that I caught it on.  And that was great.  I had a number of people 
who called me up and they thought that they had won a prize.  [Both laugh]  So I'd say, "well you
didn't win a prize, but I can tell you where I caught that fish before and when I released him."  
And I said, "we'll see how much he's grown."  That's about all.  I said, "I mark them so that when
I catch them again, I can tell how much they have grown in a year, or two years, or whatever that
I caught them."  (D:  Yeah)  Well another guy called me one time.  He said, "gee Sherm," and he 
knew me.  He said, "I was cleaning this fish, he said, I scunned it out and he says, there was no 
mark."  He said, "I didn't see anything on it."  And he says, "when I cleaned it," he scunned it and
he peeled it.  And when he pulled the skin off, instead of just filleting it, he pulls the skin off and 
then fillets it.  (D:  Right)  He said, "when I pulled the skin off there was this yellow tag 
underneath the fin, under the skin."  So it had grown over the tag see.  The tag and I stuck it in 
and it would lay right on the (--)  And evidently, it evidently been on there two or three years at 
least, and it had grown right over.  But he said, "that's all I could see on it was Sherm, so he said, 
I knew that it was you."  And so he called me up and told me, but then the guy went out of 
business, so I lost my little thing that you put the spaghetti tag in.  I still got some spaghetti tags, 
but I don't have the little thing to insert it in.  
D:  Who would sell those things?
S:  Well a fella from down in Tennessee [cannot transcribe rest of sentence, next few sentences 
are unclear].
D:  [Unclear] got it through the mail.
S:  Yeah, yeah.  I paid, I used to pay, it was $25.00 for one hundred of them, and the applicator 
and a little booklet to mark them down, you know.  It was interesting. 
D:  Anyone else do that around here?
S:  My friend Lenny did, yeah. (D:  Yeah)  I don't know anybody else that did around here.  
Probably a few guys that did.  They all went out of business, because I sent down to him to get 
some applicator and I never got it back.  And I told another fella that was interested and he wrote
down and he got his check back.  They had evidently gone out of business.  Now this is Lowell 
Textile.  Here is the Pawtucket Boulevard.  
D:  Okay, we are on the northern side of the river now or what?
S:  Yeah.  The north side of the river.  Now right over there the shad come up and they catch 
them pretty good right over there.  That is in back of the University of Lowell.  And there is a 
raceway there.  (D:  Uh huh)  We could drive down there and let you take a look that.  Do you 
want to take some pictures maybe, or something?
D:  Sure.
S:  There is a place down there where we can go.  Let's see, how are we going to get there now?  
That is one way.  [Unclear]
D:  We can go on ahead down the river and come back there later on if you want, if that is easier. 
What is this bridge called right here?
S:  This is Textile Bridge.  (D:  Okay)  Next one is School Street, or, now I am not giving you the
true name of the bridge.  I'm giving you, for instance, Textile Avenue.
D:  Right.  Which one is the Aiken Street Bridge?  Have we past that?
S:  That is the one we just passed back there.  That is back there.
D:  Okay.  (S:  Yeah)  Someone was mentioning that there was often times some shore fishing, 
people fishing off the bridge there.
S:  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  They fish for carp there. We have got some tremendous carp in this river.
D:  Really!
S:  Oh yeah!  When I say tremendous, they will go up to thirty pounds.  
D:  No kidding!  Wow!
S:  Oh yeah.  [Sentence unclear] Oh, I imagine they got some bigger than thirty, but I have seen.  
I saw one that was thirty pounds.  I have seen a number of twenty odd pounders.  (D:  Umhm)  I 
don't fish for them myself.  I am definitely a bass fisherman.  The drivers around here are not 
quite as bad as Boston, but they come close.  [Laughs]  
D:  I was going to say, fishing may be exciting, but driving isn't [unclear].
S:  Oh, you have to keep your eyes on the road every second.  (D:  Yeah)  Well I learned that in 
the Post Office.  Boy, I'll tell you, I don't think there was a day went by when I was driving at the
Post Office that if I wasn't alert every second you would have had an accident the way pull out in
front of you sometimes.  (D:  Umhm)  Unbelievable!  (D:  Yeah)  Now we can take a walk down 
here and I'll show you where they fish for the shad.  I don't fish from up here.  I fish for them 
down in Lawrence.  And they just come in from the ocean down there.  So when they come in 
down there, they are a much stronger fish.  They are a little tired by the time they get up here, 
you know.
D:  Right.  What time of year do you fish for shad?
S:  Usually they come in around April.  Anywhere's from, it depends on the weather a lot, of 
course, (D:  Right) but it depends on the pressures we have in the spring when we have our (--)  
We have a high, high water level like we did this past year, they come in late, but anywhere from
the seventh to the fourteenth ordinarily.   I haven't been down here this year.  I hope we can get in
here.
D:  Are these cars mainly for one of these companies down here?
S:  Well they're mostly from the University I think.  (D:  Uh huh) Well this is all, this is a 
Research Foundation from the University.  This is all University property.  I think we ought to 
find a place down the end here, someplace to park.  So you are from Maine, huh?
D:  Yeah, I live down in (--)
S:  This is the first year since 1946 that I haven't got a New Hampshire hunting license yet.  I am 
going to get it, but I haven't got it yet.  I am seriously thinking of going to Maine.  (D:  Yeah) I 
have only bought three Maine licenses, but I am batting a thousand in Maine.  No, I take it back. 
take it back.  I bought four.  I didn't get one the last time I went out.
D:  Is it a lottery now to get a license there?  How do they (--) Does everyone get a license?
S:  No, it is a lottery for the moose, (D:  Oh yeah, right) but you can get a license for (--)  I don't 
know whether we can park.  I guess I can squeeze through and park over there.  This is okay if 
somebody don't block us in.  Too bad the sun wasn't out.  (D: Woe, tight here)  Why should we 
walk down?  [Laughs]  I don't walk anymore than I have to anymore.  (D:  Right)  Yeah, well, 
that area that you spoke about up in Maine where you are from, the Belgrade area, I think that 
that's the area where they get the biggest bucks in the state too, up in that area.
D:  It is pretty good up there, yup.
S:  Yeah, the biggest bucks in the area come from (--)  I mean every once in awhile there's a three
hundred, I think every year there is one or two three hundred pounders shot up there and a 
tremendous amount of two hundred pounders shot up there.  (D:  Umhm, yup)  Now (--)
D:  Now, we are down on the opposite shore?
S:  We are on the south side now.
D:  And what do you call this area here?
S:  Well, that is the, Aiken Street Bridge is down there.  You can't quite see it, it's just around the 
bend.  (D:  Right)  That section over there, you see that wall over there?  (D:  on the opposite 
shore?)  That's where Beaver Brook comes in, yeah).  (D:  Oh yeah!)  That comes down from 
New Hampshire.  And up here, this is the new ladder that we have here in Lowell.  I was 
surprised, but they put a ladder here.
D:  Fish ladder you mean?
S:  Yeah, fish elevator, I'm sorry.  (D:  Oh really!)  The ladder is up above it, the Pawtucket Dam. 
But they put an elevator here.  So the shad come up here and they lift them over and they go into 
the canal.  Now I may be wrong here, but I think they go into the canal and swing around and 
come out the Western Canal, into the river.  I am not positive of that.  I have not checked into 
that, but at least I know the lift them and they go up stream.
D:  Now this, right in front of us here, where the water is starting to get a little white here, (S:  
Yeah, that's rough water there) is this known by a particular name, this spot down in here?
S:  Yeah.  They used to call it the rocks.  You can't see them, but there are all rocks out here.  And
all down in here, this is all rocks.  Well you can see the rocks over there, you know?  This is all 
rock here.  They just call it the rocks below, below the School Street Bridge, or the Textile 
Bridge, (D:  Uh huh) in back of the Textile School.  This is where they fish for the shad, right 
here in this run.  They call it the shad run now.  (D:  Umhm)  I don't know whether these glasses 
will help or not.  Let's see.  [Sentence unclear]  (D:  Yeah)  There are guys who fish in here.  (D:  
Huh?)  When they're fishing here, they fish all the way from just down below the end of the 
fence there, in that water there, from the shore.  No boats here as you can see.  You would never 
have any boat out there.  And up here, they use what they call a shad dart with a lead, some of 
them use a weight with it, but they're lead weights anyway, just colored, red and white, yellow 
and gold, different colors, all kinds.  Chatreuse, it would be in different colors, whatever the guy 
prefers. 
D:  You call it a dart?
S:  Yeah, shad darts.  (D:  Yeah)  It's got a single hook on it, a little lead weight and they go from,
oh, from a thirty second of an ounce, up to an eight of an ounce.  And they cast them up stream 
and let them go along like this.  They go like this, jig them.  (D:  Umhm)  And as it drops back, 
usually that's when the fish hits.  And as you go like this, you feel them and you set your hook, 
(D:  right) and you bring them in.
D:  So people would walk down the shore from east of us here?
S:  Yup.  Yup.  And they walk from here right up to the elevator almost, (D:  Oh yeah) as far as 
they can.  It is late in the season now.  I don't think anybody is fishing for them.  I don't know if 
there is any shad out here or not, I doubt it.  (D:  Yeah)  I doubt it now.  But in the Spring they 
start lifting them down there in, I think June.  Sometime in June they start lifting the fish up.  It 
doesn't take them long to get up here.  This past year so far I believe they lifted something like 
16,000, the last report I had was l6,000 some odd shad.  (D:  Wow!)  And I am sure that just 
about ninety-nine percent of them made it up to here.  And then the rest of them, they put them 
up above.  They go on up as far as  Manchester, because I know they've been catching them up 
as far as Manchester, New Hampshire.  Now that is a good run.  Now the advantage of having 
them get up above there [unclear], which means that they go to the ocean to spawn.  They go to 
the ocean to feed rather and grow up.  And then they come back here to spawn.  When they 
spawn up there, their little fish come all the way down again.  So the state started this program.  I
can't tell you when, a long time ago.  And it became very successful.  It was a very successful 
fisheries as they call it.  And then they started the Atlantic Salmon thing.  And that has not been 
what they call successful yet.  But I think it will be and I think there has been a lot more salmon 
come back then they realize.  I have seen a tremendous amount of Salmon down here compared 
to the amount of Salmon they have picked up in the ladder.  Some reason they are not coming 
into the ladder the way they should.  I think there is a tremendous amount of salmon that come 
up and go out.  Of course we had a tremendous amount of things that cause the salmon not to 
come back.  Just the fact attrition alone just from the natural predators, but then we have the 
commercial fishermen.  That does a lot.  I'm only, this is only second hand, (D:  Sure) but I had a 
friend of mine that told me he was down in Gloucester and he saw a boat come in, a fishing boat 
and it had five cases of salmon in it.   Now you are talking about, I'm guessing, approximately 
about one hundred pounds of fish in that big box.  So there was five of them there.  Now how 
many fish are in a box?  I don't know, but you know, that hurts.  Now that was just one boat.  
How many other boats do it?  (D:  Yeah)  You know, they should put a moratorium on them and 
say, "hey, no salmon".  Don't allow them to catch them.  When they get them in the nets though, 
they're [unclear], they are going to catch them in the nets, I suppose they are going to lose half of
them anyways.  But if they made them throw them back, there would be a few survive, half of 
them.  I don't know just how many would survive.
D:  Yeah, right,  but what is this construction that is going on on the opposite bank here?
S:  Well evidently they are building a new wall, see.  This is a little bit of flood control I think,  
(D:  Oh yeah) for one thing, but it is also to keep the erosion, you know, (D:  right)  because 
when the river comes high (--)  Like this past year we had flooding conditions all along the 
Merrimack.  All the way down, down to Methuen and Lowell here too, what they call little, we 
used to call it Little Canada.  I don't know what they call it now.
D:  That was down in here?
S:  Yeah.  (D:  Oh yeah!)  Well that was all flooded over in there, real bad.  The water was way 
over the, see the walls down there?  It was way over the walls.  It was up in here.
D:  So Beaver Brook again is right over in there?
S:  Yeah.  It comes out there.  There is the mouth of Beaver Brook there.  (D:  Oh yeah)  It comes
down from Beaver Lake way up in Dery, New Hampshire.  (D:  Umhm)  Quite a ways from here.
Probably forty odd miles from here.  As the crow flies, as the river goes it would probably be 
twice that, because you know, it bends unbelievable.  
D:  Right.
S:  Now the next stretch of river, from this bridge here, from the Textile Avenue Bridge, to the 
Mammoth Road Bridge, that is only probably three quarters of a mile.  It is solid rocks and there 
is not too much water there.  This water here, you see, is coming from the canal, what they call 
the Western canal.  Above the falls there is a canal that comes in and comes down through the 
system, through, Lowell has a system of canals.  And it comes out, one of them comes out here.  
The others come out down, further in downtown Lowell, down by the Bridge Street Bridge.  
There are several waste ways down there, this side of the bridge and the other side.  They went 
through and they furnished the power for the mills, the Boott Mills (D:  Right) Corporation, as 
far as I know, still own most of it, (D:  Umhm) the control of it.
S:  We can take a ride up.  I haven't even looked at that fish ladder myself.  (D:  Okay)  We can 
see if we can find a spot and take a look at that new fish ladder.  (D:  All righty)  See what it 
looks like, there is a lot of construction going on up there.  Has been now for a couple of years.  I
just don't know exactly what they're doing, but they have been tearing that road up (D:  Yup) for 
a long time now.  We can find a place to park someplace and walk over to it and take a look.  (D: 
Okay, sure).  And then I will show you the boat ramp up there, the public boat ramp.  Then there 
is another boat ramp for the, you have to belong to a boat club to get into that.  (D:  Uh huh)  
Then we will go up as far as the line.
D:  Okay.  [Long pause]  So what happened to Little Canada anyway?
S:  Well, [laughs] a lot of people got flooded out pretty bad. Methuen was worse.  People from 
Methuen were flooded out real bad.  It was bad over here in some places.  Same as all places, 
when the water recedes the people go to work and try to clean up the place.  Try to get some low 
interests loans to pay for the damages.
D:  Yup.  Okay, on this side you got a foot or so.  These are university dorms over here?
S:  Yeah, here and all across the street.  It is quite a, quite a big place now.  (D:  Umhm)  Used to 
be called Lowell Textile School and finally became the University.  It is quite a place, it is known
all over the world.  Lowell was once the Textile Industry of the nation.  (D:  Right)  I don't come 
down here fishing.  They don't say anything, but I just, I don't know, I just don't care for the area.
And I am a bass fisherman anyway.  After I do a little bit of early fishing down there in 
Lawrence and I get my fill of the shad fishing and I go down there because I can also catch a 
salmon.  Although they have made it illegal to keep one down there.  I don't mind that part.  At 
least you can catch one and then release them.  You can keep them above the Lawrence, the 
Essex Dam up here, if you catch one up here.  But they don't release any up here so that you can 
fish for them.  [Laughs]  
D:  Oh, I see.
S:  I don't understand that part.  I don't say I don't understand it, I do, they want the (--)  This guy 
is going the wrong way.  [Whistles]  
D:  Did you grow up here in Lowell, Sherm?
S:  I was born in Quincy (D:  Yeah) and I moved here when I was six (--)  Well I moved  to 
Dracut when I was six years old. Then I spent the rest of my life in Lowell, except in the four 
years in the navy out in the South Pacific.  I have enjoyed Lowell pretty well.  It is a nice little 
town.  It is as good as any town in the country.  It is the same as every town in the country.  You 
know, you get out of it what you put into it.  (D:  Right)  I have got a million friends here in 
Lowell, which makes me feel good.  I guess I probably only met three people in my life that I 
wouldn't consider friends.
D:  Well that is a pretty good record.
S:  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.
D:  Boy, that is amazing!
S:  Only three of them.
D:  Were you in the navy during the war?
S:  Yup.  (D:  Yeah)  Yeah, I joined just before World War II.  I got out a couple of months after 
World War II.  Now this is the Textile Bridge.  Look to the left there, see all the rocks down 
there?  There is hardly any water.
D:  Right.  So we are back on the northern bank again here?
S:  Yeah.  We are on now what they call the Pawtucket Boulevard.  (D:  Umhm)  I am going to 
put my hat on.  (D:  There you go)  This is Ray's Flies, a friend of mine ties flies, (D:  Is that here
in town?) Ray Gagnon, yeah.  (D:  Oh yeah!)  He is a good fly tier.  In fact he lives right down 
here at 12 1/2 Third Avenue.  And he is as good a fly tier as there is around.  And he will tie just 
exactly what you ask him to.  (D:  Uh huh)  If he doesn't have what you want, you got something
special, you tell him how to tie it and he will tie it.  Now this is the Mammoth Road Bridge, or 
School Street Bridge, some people call it.  (D:  Yeah)  Now the ladder is right up here on the left. 
I doubt if we are going to find a place to park.  Let's see.  Why don't we park right here (D:  
Okay) and walk towards it, it's not too far.  (D:  Sure)  I think we can park right here out of the 
way, nobody is going to bother us.  This looks like they want you to head in here.  (D:  Okay)  
Just lock it.  Why don't you read that piece that Eric Sawtelle wrote? 
D:  Yeah, I would like to.
S:  You might be interested in writing to him.  Like you say, you are just in Massachusetts though
right now.  You are not (--)
D:  Well I would be interested just for my personal information too.
S:  Well, like I told you, I am pretty proud of that Charter that we wrote up in the Centraville 
Sportsmen Club.  I am also proud that I am a Founding Father and Charter member of that club.  
Up here the Greater Lowell Fly Fishers, a very active fishing club.  And the, and Salmon 
Unlimited, which is a great club up in New Hampshire, up in Greenland, New Hampshire.  
D:  Oh yeah?
S:  Yeah, but I am not active anymore.  I am just a dues paying member, but (--)  Now this is, this
is all you got of the river coming down here, see.  (D:  Yeah)  Not too much water right. See, 
now very little water coming there.  Now there is what I told you was the western canal, see it 
over there.
D:  Directly across there on the other bank?
S:  See where the break water, the little break water is out there  with the cans?  Right in there, 
that is the Western Canal.  
D:  Right.  Oh, I see.
S:  It goes in there and then it goes down through Dummer Street, crosses School Street and 
down through Dummer I think, it goes right down the main part of town.  And a section of it 
swerves off and goes out there where we were, where the elevator is.  In fact four young kids just
drowned down there last week.  
D:  Oh yeah.  Is there much fishing that happens around in here?
S:  Oh yeah.  We have some pretty good tournaments on the river. A lot of bass masters, different
bass organizations have (--)  In this river we have got some tremendous fish.  We've got a good  
concentration.  I would say the largest concentration of small mouth in this part of the country.  
Tremendous amount of small mouth.  Down below and up above, but you got large mouth, small 
mouth, pickerel, quibee, or sunfish, brim as they call them down south, yellow perch, hornpout, 
pickerel, calico bass, hornpout, different varieties of, I call them hornpout or catfish.  There is 
three or four different varieties at least.  Eels, two different kinds of eels I am sorry to say since 
they put the elevator in down there.  We now have the lamprey eel up here.
D:  Oh really.
S:  I don't think they last up here.  They just come up here and then head back.  I don't think they 
mate up here.  They may, I am not sure.  I haven't seen them mating up here.  Now from up in 
New Hampshire every once in awhile we get uh, [unclear] that comes down here.  A northern, I 
caught a northern thirty years ago at the mouth of Brook, but I haven't heard of anybody catching
a northern around here, but I heard them catching pike once in awhile.  And you will get different
varieties of trout, but not many, it is rare.  It is rare that they catch a trout, but I'd say the 
predominant fishing here is carp and suckers, carp more predominant fish, but a tremendous 
amount of bass.  Not a tremendous amount of big ones, but there are big ones here, it is just that 
they are a little harder to catch.  (D:  Umhm, umhm) [Laughs]  We will go up here now.  Oh 
jeese, I don't know, they  don't want us to walk over this.
D:  It looks like not.
S:  We'll walk around the side.  (D:  Okay)  I forget that you are taping and I once in awhile slip.  
[Laughs]  I guess you could cut that out, huh?
D:  What's that now?
S:  I said, once in awhile I've slipped and said a word or two that is not suppose to be on tape.  
[Laughs]  
D:  Yeah, I probably will to.  Don't worry about that.
S:  Well maybe we can talk to somebody here and find out what the heck is going on [Laughs] 
here besides a lot of confusion.  (D:  Yeah)  Boy, I tell you, they sure have confused this area for 
the last two years now with the construction.  (D:  Oh yeah)  They started at least two years ago 
on this elevator, it was in terrible condition.  They put a new one in as far as I know.  I don't 
know how far up we can get here.  We might bump into somebody that might want to talk to us, 
but I doubt it.
D:  Well that is okay.
S:  I guess that we are not going to walk up on the inside.  We ain't going to walk up there either.
D:  This is far enough.  We can see the ladder down here.
S:  Now this is the new ladder, see.  You see like what I said there, the main floor of the water(--)
Of course when the water is high there will be plenty of water here.  You know, evidently they 
are going to come in around there and then go up the ladder this way.  
D:  Oh yeah.  Now is that powered by any kind of pumping system?
S:  No, no.
D:  It is all natural.
S:  I think so.  Until they get squared away here you are not going to be able to get a good look at
it evidently.  (D:  Right)  Now in the spring the water is coming over here.  It is just as high here 
as it is there.  (D:  Wow)  The water will be right even with the top of those boards.  And this past
year it was way over the boards and still even here, you know.  (D:  Wow)  It was up quite a bit.  
Well the big flood we had back in '36, it knocked out the Bridge Street bridge.  They had to stop 
the traffic going over it, because the supports were that bad.  (D:  Umhm, yeah)  We had 
everything coming down the river that year.  There is a tremendous amount of fish that hang 
around.  Like right now we could go over there and catch a couple of fish right in that little pool. 
There will be a couple of small mouth bass, a couple of large mouth bass.  
D:  What, right down here on this side?
S:  Right over in there, yeah.  (D:  Really?)  Right where the water is falling off the dam in there. 
(D:  Umhm, umhm)  There would be a few fish there.
D:  Now what is that blue building across the shore there?
S:  That is a boat house.  (D:  Yeah)  That is a private boat house.  All these boats here they 
belong to that.  I think it is the Lowell Boat Club, Lowell Motor Boat Club, Lowell Motor Boat 
Club, I believe.
D:  Oh yes, okay.
S:  Now the uh, there is another one up the river here.  We will see that on the way up after we 
get up a little further.  I will show you the next stop will be the public launch.  (D:  Okay)  And 
they have a nice little small park there.  Not too much parking room when they have a 
tournament.  A little crowded.  (D:  Okay)  Now this is as much to see about the ladder.  Is this 
guy coming down to see us or what?  (D:  Nah)  Now let's wait a minute, see if he can give us 
some information.  Maybe he wants to come down and kick us out of here, but maybe we can 
talk to him.  We, there is no signs about saying no walking either, you know.  Maybe he can tell 
us what is going on.  I would like to know myself.  [Laughs]  
D:  What is that white thing on the bank down in there?  Is that that little stage area that the 
regatta has?
S:  I think that is part of it.  (D:  Oh yeah)  Yeah, I am not sure.  [Talking to someone else]  How 
are you doing?  (Unknown voice:  Are you going out?)  Yeah, probably.  You can introduce 
yourself Dave.
D:  Hi, I am Dave Taylor.  I work for the Library of Congress.  We are just doing some research 
here in Lowell about different traditions that are carried on.  I am with Mr. O'Brien here today 
talking to him about fishing and uses of the river.  We were just wondering what you guys were 
up to here today.
Unknown voice:  Yeah this is a pipe line we are putting in.
D:  Oh yeah.
S:  Oh, it is a pipeline.
Unknown voice:  Yeah, it is a sewer pipe.  It is a intercepter.
S:  Oh, for the intercepter?
Unknown voice:  It is an intercepter. 
S:  This has been going on (--)  Not you guys, not this particular thing, but this has been tied up 
now for about three years since they started with the elevator here. 
Unknown voice:  Fish ladder, yeah.
S:  Yeah, they started with that.  And ah, Jesus Christ, this road has been unbelievable.  
(Unknown voice:  Yeah, it has, I know) Terrible.  I didn't know what was going on here.  I said to
my wife, it has to be something to do with the water here.
Unknown voice:  No, this is just a sewer.  It is all going down to the new treatment plant.
S:  Yeah, well, that is good.  I say it is good.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know whether the 
treatment plant (--)
Unknown voice:  Well it is all (--)
S:  They can't handle anymore than they got now.  [Laughs] 
Unknown voice:  I know.  It is all in an effort to clean the river bed.
S:  Well that is good.  [Cannot hear conversation due to noise in background]  
D:  So that was the fish ladder, as much as we could see of it.
S:  That was the fish ladder, yeah, what we could see of it.  [Laughs]  
D:  How long has that been erected down there now?
S:  Well I think they completed this last year.
D:  Oh yeah.
S:  Well like he said (--)  I couldn't get to see it this spring, because they had all this construction 
going on.
D:  Right.
S:  Came down here the other day, had my wife up at the hospital.  Her mother is up there now.  
And I said, uh, gee, I don't have any idea what they are doing.  Must be something to do with the 
water pipes, because they were digging down so deep.  Digging down so deep, because they 
were putting those big intercepter tanks in there, or pipe lines.  That's a big pipe, right?  (D:  
Yeah)  Now this is what they call the Sampson Pavilion.  We had a heck of a guy by the name of 
Charlie Sampson.  He was an editorial writer and worked for the Lowell Sun, (D:  Yeah) which is
our best and only newspaper.  [Laughs]  It is a good newspaper.  That is what they call Sampson 
Pavilion.  (D:  Uh huh)  They will have the Regatta here and they have the band there.
D:  This is nice over here.
S:  Yeah.  This is not bad at all.  This is the boat ramp over here.  I'll drive over and show you in 
a moment. (D:  Okay, oh yeah)  It is not much.  And then you park your trailer over here.  See, 
there is one guy out (D:  Right) evidently.  (D:  Oh yeah)  It is not a bad boat ramp, it's a good 
boat ramp, but we need more of them around.  
D:  Yeah.  Is this the only one along the stretch here?
S:  It is the only one here, yeah.  (D:  Wow!)  Yeah.  Well there is one up above, but it is private.  
It is for the boat club members, yacht club.  I don't know if it is a yacht club, or a motor boat club
right up the road.  I will show you where it is.  (D:  Okay)  We had the March of Dimes fishing 
derby here for the benefit of the March of Dimes of course.  And there was a kid fishing here for 
carp.  (D:  Umhm)  Now they fish different for carp then they do for bass, or pickerel, or 
anything.  And he had corn, which is also a good bait for trout.  A lot of people wouldn't use it, 
but it is quite a bait for trout.  [Laughs]  
D:  You mean a kernel of corn?
S:  Kernel of corn, yeah, that's right, just corn Kernel corn on a hook.  And he was fishing.  And 
it is a good bait for carp and suckers, carp especially.  And he was fishing here for the carp and 
he caught, I just forget the weight of it, but it was about a three pound pickerel, which is a very 
decent pickerel around here now a days, because I think pickerel were the first fish to be hurt by 
the acid rain.  We don't have anywhere's near the number of pickerel we use to have.  And we 
don't have anywhere's near the size of the pickerel we use to have in the ponds anymore.  And I 
think that they were more allergic to the acid rain then any fish going, because they are a 
different type of fish.  They are slender, you know.  And I am only guessing, I don't know 
nothing about it.  It is just from what I have seen and observed over the years of fishing, but the 
kid caught that pickerel and he won the first prize for the category, which was, I think it was 
$500.00.  
D:  Wow!  [Laughs]  Not bad for a kernel of corn.
S:  Oh, that was (--)  And there is nothing I like better than to see a kid win the contest, or catch a
big fish (D:  That's great) when nobody else is catching a fish and the kid catches one, you know.
[Laughs]  But for him to win the contest over all of those guys who think they're great fishermen,
you know.  The majority of fishermen they think they are the best there is.  You could talk to 
them and might have forgotten more then they will ever know, but they are the best fishermen 
there is.  And you know (--)  [Laughs]  That's the way some sportsman are.
D:  Well that is a good story.  [Laughs]
S:  You want to hear a good story about kids?  I will tell you a good story.  I was fishing down in 
Lawrence a few years ago and this kid (--)  The water had dropped down quite a bit and the main
channel right underneath the bridge you could walk out to it and fish cast right across the 
channel.  I walked down this cast, this kid was eight, ten feet to my right.  And I saw him cast out
and he casted right across the canal, the channel and he had a shad dart.  He was fishing for shad.
And he hooked up on the other side.  Well as he hooked up he dropped his rod tip so his line hit 
the water. Well just as he did that a big, I say big, I mean big, a big sturgeon surfaced and he hit 
the dorsal fin of that sturgeon.  And when he hit he came right out of the water from his head to 
the back of his dorsal fin.  (D:  Yeah)  I will tell you the thing had to be about nine feet long.  We 
saw about six feet of it then, you know.  The kid says, "Holy Jesus, did you see that!"  [Both 
laugh]  I said, "yeah, he's on your line!"  And the kid thought he was on his line.  And you talk 
about being excited.  I was almost as excited as he was.  (D:  Wow!)  We will take a ride in here 
(D:  Okay) to the boat ramp.  And I said to the kid, you know, I said,  "nobody is going to believe
you when you tell them you had a nine foot fish on the end of your line with a shad dart."  That is
a little bitty lure, you know.  And I said, "nobody is going to believe you."  So I said, "you go 
home and tell your father he is going to wash your mouth out with soap."  [Laughs]  And so I 
said, "I will give you my name and address and you tell your father to call me, or anybody else 
that don't believe you, because I was right here and I will tell them that you had the fish on.  He 
didn't really, but just the same.  And I will tell you, I believe that that kid will be a fisherman for 
the rest of his life.  You know, I don't know how much fishing (--)  He evidently had fish before, 
because I could tell the way he was casting he knew what he was doing.  He was only, you know,
ten years old, give or take a year or so.  And you know, that is quite an experience.  I, goodness 
sake, I had been sixty years before I saw a sturgeon.  And this old timer that hangs around down 
at the river, he knows the river better than anybody, Joe Silva.  Just the year before that he had 
taken me up, we we'd be talking and he was telling me about that sturgeon.  And I said, "gee, I 
have never seen one Joe."  Oh I have seen sturgeon, but I mean I have never seen one in the 
water around here.  And so he took me up on the bridge and he looked down the pool and he 
said, "look at that', and there was one down about six feet.  But this one here, that one had to be 
nine feet long.  Like I say, I didn't see the whole thing, but what I saw of it, you know, it was 
monstrous!  I don't think you could have put your arms around it.  That is how big it was.  (D:  
Wow)  So that kid was really thrilled.  Do you want to get out and look at this or what?  There is 
nothing really to look at.
D:  Well, I have walked around here a little bit (S:  Did you?) so we can go along.
                                                                  S:  See, this is the Merrimack Valley Inboard Regatta.  
Oh no, that's, this is a Motor Boat Club, not a yacht club.  I guess it's a, well it welcomes rowing,
sailing and everything, (D:  Oh yeah, okay) but you have to be a member.  (D:  Uh huh)  They 
don't allow just anybody to go and (D:  Right) put their boat in here.  (D:  Nice facility)  Oh it is, 
but it should be made public.  [Laughs]
D:  Yeah.  Is Joe Silva still alive?
S:  Yeah, yeah, he is down the river quite often.
D:  He lives in Lowell does he?
S:  No, he lives in Lawrence.  [Pause]  Well now we're coming to, can't get too not much further, 
we will be, we'll go as far as the Tyngsboro Bridge, there's no need of going beyond that.
D:  Okay.  What do you call this bridge right here?
S:  This is the brand new bridge. This is the [starts to sing], I know what it is.  Oh boy, isn't that 
awful, I can't think of the name of it and I know it.  (D:  It will come to you)  I think it is named 
after a councilor I think, that I knew.  Oh my goodness.  [Laughs]  Oh my goodness.  I have only 
been over it once.  It is out of my neck of the woods, you know.  (D:  Oh yeah, yeah)  My 
goodness, I should know it.  That is a shame.
D:  I just noticed that we just passed a road, an Old Ferry Road there.  (S:  Old Ferry Road, yeah)
Was there a ferry here at one time?
S:  Well, possibly at the end of the road there might have been a ferry down here.  Yeah, very 
well could be.  (D:  Yeah)  Of course you are talking sixty, seventy, eighty years ago they use to 
have all kinds of that type transportation, because there wasn't much of anything else outside of 
horse and wagons and few 1910 lizzies, you know?  Out to Lakeview, Lake Mascupic, the next 
town in Dracut, it's a small pond, Lakeview and they use to have a steamer out there. (D:  
Really}  A big one and it sunk in the twenties.  Sometime about the time I was born.
D:  Was that their transportation on boats?
S:  Yeah, well they use to just have an excursion around the lake. (D:  Oh yeah)  My goodness, 
the thing use to just get up to steam and it would be around the lake.  [Laughs]  The lake was 
only about a mile across and a mile wide.  (D:  Yeah)  So it doesn't take long to go around it, you 
know.  I don't know, probably the circumference was probably no more than four miles.  So by 
the time they went around it they were just about getting up to steam, but somehow or other it 
sunk.  I don't know what the cause was, whether they hit bottom, or blew up a steam engine, or 
what the heck they had.  [Laughs]  But I know as kids we use to like it, because we use to go 
over there and fish where the steamer was sunk,  it was always good bass fishing.  It made good 
stuff for the bass to hang around, you know?  They call that structure fishing now.  We use to say,
well, we know where the bass hang out.  Points and land, rocks and debris.  (D:  Uh huh)  In fact 
for years we use to put (--)  Christmas, we'd throw the christmas out so that they would sink 
through the ice (D:  Oh yeah!) and we know a spot that would be a good spot to fish.
D:  The trees would attract the fish?
S:  Now I see in the Bass Masters and different catalogs, they have these things, make believe 
trees that you can buy to sink them in the lake and know where they are and the fish will be 
hanging around there.  They say if there are thirty fish hanging around a certain area, put one of 
those down and there will be four hundred fish, or three hundred fish, or something like that 
hanging around area.  (D:  Yeah)  I think that is a little exaggerated, but there is no doubt about it,
it will help.
D:  Yeah.  I see we have just crossed the line into Tyngsboro here, right?
S:  Yeah, so you are beyond Lowell now, I forgot about that.
D:  That is okay.
S:  There is really nothing up here outside of the next spot is  the Tyngsboro Country Club.  
There is really nothing up here, is there?  Vesper Country Club is the next one.  A lot of fishing, 
we do a lot of fishing up there, but that is private.  I can't treat you in there.  We come up the 
river and there is Tyngs Island they call it.  There is a little water that comes around it.  It is like 
Duck Island use to be.  (D:  Yeah)  Like a little river comes around here, the main body of the 
water comes down here and the river comes around.
D:  The Country Club is on Tyngs Island?
S:  Yes.  On both sides too.  They have a fabulous country club here, fabulous golf course, a real 
nice golf course.  You have to be a member I guess.  It is not public.
D:  Yeah, yeah.
S:  Years and years ago I use to play a little golf.  I was fortunate enough to have a couple of 
friends that invited me up.  I played it, I think I played it twice.  I know I played it once,  I think 
it's twice, I'm not sure.  (D:  Yeah)  Yeah, there is no need of going up here, there is not that much
up here.  Got to go quite a ways to see the Tyngsboro Bridge.  Well I can't think of much of 
anything else.  Here, this is part of it here.
D:  Oh yes, I see and that is the island that crosses the bridge here.  (S:  Yeah, yeah)  Do you 
remember if anyone ever built small fishing boats to use on the river here in the past?
S:  Small fishing boats?
D:  Or any kind of boats to use around here?  Was that ever done, any boat building?
S:  No, I don't know anybody that did any boat building around here.  Outside of a few different 
guys that might have a built boat of their own, built a row boat, you know, a few people who that
are [coughs] quite handy doing things like that.  (D:  Right)  Some people can do anything.  I had
a friend Johnny Green.  I tried to take a Merrimack Canoe apart once.  That was molded 
fiberglass.  That was nice.
D:  Ribs?
S:  Yeah, I was trying to think of the kind, cedar ribs.  (D:  Oh yeah)  And I never would have 
been able to complete it if it wasn't for Johnny Green.  He could build a boat.  He helped me take
it apart, he had all the clamps.  I never realized what a job I was getting into.  I had to replace the
gunnels in the canoe.  I would have been better off to go and buy another canoe.  [Laughs]  
Johnny Green bailed me out.  Off hand I don't know if any boat builders.  There probably is one 
or two around, but I just don't know them.  
D:  You're friend, Ray Gagnon, does he, are there many other people who make flies and sell 
around here?
S:  Oh yeah, oh yeah.  A lot of, there are a tremendous amount of fly fishers.  Well I belong in 
this, they call it the Greater Lowell Fly Fishers.  (D:  Right)  And I would say at least half of the 
members in there are, what they call, fly tiers.  (D:  Umhm) And good fly tiers too, the majority 
of them are good fly tiers.  Ray would be, I would consider Ray a professional definitely, 
because he and of course some of the other guys would be offended if I didn't call them 
professional to, because they are good.  But Ray has been tying them for years and I have caught 
a lot of fish with his flies.  I don't do a lot of trout and salmon fishing now.  Oh, I loved the 
salmon fishing up in New Hampshire, but like anything else, politics tried to stop the [unclear] 
program up there.  And so for the last few years the fishing has been terrible, but it will be good 
again next year.  The organized sportsmen finally I think, made them realize what an important 
fishery it was.  Just like this salmon fishery here in the Merrimack River and the Shad program, 
these are very important things.  What the legislators that have anything to do with it.  When I 
say legislators, I am not blaming all the politicians.  The ones that get involved with making the 
decisions whether or not to spend the money.  They don't know all the little side effects.  For 
example, a guy like myself just an average, maybe below average as far as income and 
everything is concerned, spend a lot of money to go fishing.  They don't realize how much 
money is involved that the economy brings in from fishing.  A tremendous amount!  Now even 
down there from the Essex Dam down all the way to the ocean, you don't need a fishing license 
right now.  It's a controversy that nobody wants to stick their neck out and say that the tide water 
mark is down in Haverhill, or that it is up in Methuen.  It's not, it is way down in Haverhill 
someplace, but even if they were a little wrong, they should say this is it and that's it.  And 
anywhere below here you don't need a license, but anywhere above here you need a license.  (D: 
Umhm)  But there is a tremendous amount of people that have gone fishing for the shad just here
alone and they have only come up here the last two years, three years at the most.  (D:  Umhm)  
There has been a tremendous amount of licenses bought, but then when the guy buys a license he
has got to go and buy a different type of a line and different types of lures.  Now when he goes 
fishing with those things he doesn't buy two or three lures, he has to buy twenty or thirty.  And 
the first time he goes fishing he usually uses, loses twenty or thirty of them.  And he has got to 
go buy twenty or thirty more, you know.  [Laughs]  And then they stop and get something to eat, 
whereas they wouldn't have.  Like when I use to go to Lawrence all the time Salmon fishing, 
when it was legal to fish for salmon, I went down there a lot and fished for the shad and the 
salmon.  Bring my wife down and we would stop at the Cedarcrest and eat down there.  And 
sometimes you buy the gas down there instead of here,  (D:  Right) but you are adding to the 
economy.  And like up in New Hampshire they didn't realize how many people were coming up 
there and spending big bucks up there, I mean big bucks when you would see the amount of 
people that were up there.  Some days just out on Little Bay alone I would see two hundred 
boats.  (D:  Wow!)  That don't sound like much, huh?  Those two hundred boats, I would guess if 
they spent a minimum, a minimum of two thousand dollars that day up there, that is a minimum. 
I am being very easy you know.  That was only in Little Bay.  That is not talking about all the 
way from Pepperell Cove to the mouth of the ocean all the way down to Lamprey River.  (D:  
Umhm)  God almighty!
D:  I was talking to a fella one time about things like this and he said, "you know, for every 
pound of fish that a sport fisherman catches he spends fifteen dollars on other things".  Like you 
are saying, your food (--)
S:  And he was being conservative.  [D: unclear]  Oh definitely, oh definitely.  Oh yeah.  I have 
caught a lot of big fish and the fella who use to be the sports writer in town, he made me a well 
known fisherman and probably considered a better fisherman than what I am, some people, you 
know.  But I do do a lot of fishing and I have caught a lot of big bass, more than the average guy 
I guess. I've caught about eight bass at over eight pounds.  Around here not too many eight 
pounders caught, I will tell you.  (D:  Yeah, yeah) And a lot of people think that every time I go 
fishing I catch bass.  Well last year I didn't get skunk once and this year I didn't get skunk once, 
but a couple of times I only caught one about that big, but at least I wasn't skunked.  [Laughed]  
But you don't catch them.  Now this year here, we have had a good year Lenny and I.  We have 
caught a tremendous amount of bass, we haven't caught too many big ones.  One seven pounder, 
a couple around six and a good number of four and five pounders, but we have caught a lot of 
them, but we haven't caught too many big ones this year.  (D:  Umhm)  You don't catch fish every
time you go fishing.  Anybody who says he does is full of baloney.  (D:  Yeah)  Thing about 
fishing is you pick your friends and you go with your friends and you plan your little trip, 
whether it is local, or outside of the state, or whatever.  You pick your friends and plan your trip 
and you go fishing and if the weather is good, fine, that is a bonus.  And if the weather isn't good,
that is too bad.  Then if the fish are biting, that is the bonus.  (D:  Umhm)  That is the bonus 
when you catch the fish, you know.  (D:  Yeah, yeah)  Let's see, is there something else that we 
can do that we've missed?  I think we have covered pretty near everything.
D:  No, I think we have covered the river pretty well here.
S:  Fairly well, as well as I can give it too you.  (D:  Yeah)  I don't fish the river a lot.  I've fished 
at a few of the tournaments just to participate in the thing for the March of Dimes and the club 
functions.  It's really the only reason I fish it.  There is a tremendous amount of fish in the river.
D:  Are there places on the river that have names, like fishing holes, or spots that you wouldn't 
necessarily see on a map that fishermen would know about?
S:  Well yeah, like Duck Island Plant and I am sure that certain guys they have a certain rock 
they call this special rock.  And down here they call it the race way, where we were, where the 
elevator is.  (D:  Oh yeah)  They call that the race way.  And that is a race way there, it comes out
of where the elevator is.  So they call that the race way.  And that is the favorite spot for shad, but
also down along down stream from where we were along the mills, I will take you down there 
and we will go across (D:  Okay) that bridge there and you will see those mills down there.  And 
they have some [unclear]  They catch them there where the raceways come out.  The shad come 
and they hang around those raceways.  See, those raceways, that is the water coming from up 
stream, comes down through the canals and comes out down there.  Well these fish are imprinted
for that water.  (D:  Umhm)  So they smell that water and they know that that is the water they 
want.  So they head into the raceways, but they can't go beyond the turbines that are in there.  
Some of them get lost in the turbine and get killed in there, (D:  Right) but I don't know how bad,
or how many, but they try to go in there and they stop trying to go up further, because they are 
imprinted for water.  Salmon and shad and I guess the [unclear] and the herring [unclear] and 
herring are one in the same.  Now we are going to go over Beaver Brook here.  (D:  Okay)  This 
is where Beaver Brook goes into the river.  (D:  Right underneath this branch here?)  There is 
Little Canada over here.  (D:  Oh yeah!) Right here, there is Beaver Brook right here. 
D:  Oh, I see.  Now people fish in that?
S:  Oh yeah.  They fish on both sides of this.  The mouth of any river is good fishing if there is 
and fish in the area.  (D: Right) You always fish the mouth of any river, both sides of it, all 
around it when you are fishing.  Any place, whether you fish in a lake, or a river and another one 
intersects you always fish that spot.  And then out there you see those islands, that's the first 
place you would go to fish is around the islands.  
D:  Oh yeah, yeah.  What bridge is this we're crossing here?
S:  This is the Aiken Street Bridge.
D:  Oh, yes, okay.
S:  Now we were up there around the corner was the raceway.  (D:  Right)  Now down here, see 
the cement walk right there?  (D:  Yeah, [unclear])  They fish all the way up and down there.  (D:
Oh yeah!)  You see Aiken Street Bridge where they fish off the bridge with bow and arrows for 
carp.  And they also fish with line and sinker.  About a hundred pound test line.  And they catch 
these carp and they pull them all the way up and they get them up there.  Sometimes you will see
the kids with a great big carp laying there.
D:  What do they do with them?
S:  Well I think most of them they throw them away, but there are some people who eat them.  
Now these Laotian people and everything, they know how to cook them.  (D:  Yeah)  And if you 
know how to cook a fish, every fish is edible.  (D:  Sure)  Now there is another canal that comes 
in down there.  Nothing for you to see, just a canal coming in.  I don't know which one that is.
D:  Is there any kind of fishing that goes on in the canals here?
S:  Yes, there is.  The kids fish for hornpout.  I guess the hornpout come down through there.  
And then sometimes, somehow, or other the salmon get into the canals.  They evidently come 
down stream when they plant them up in Tyngsboro, or further up in Nashua, or wherever and 
they come down and they go into the Western Canal.  And so they get down through one canal 
system here, which is too bad, because that is where we loose a lot of the so called smolty, the 
fish are in a smolty size when they release them, (D:  Right) which means that they are imprinted
where they are released to come back to that area.  At a certain age they drop them in like that.  
And when they come down here they get into the canals and a lot of them get lost. 
D:  Yeah, I see we are passing by the Wannalancit Mill.  What street is this we are on now?
S:  French Street.  (D:  French Street?)  French Street Extension.
D:  Okay.
S:  French Street Extension, it goes right up to Moody Street.  The other side of the lights is 
French Street and this is considered the French Street Extension.  (D:  Umhm)  Now do you want
me to take you back to your car, or back to your place where you were.
D:  Sure, [few words unclear] that way.   
S:  Well I am not sure where your car is, I got an idea.
D:  Okay.
S:  What street are you on, parked on?  On Market Street?
D:  Oh, it's beyond that.  (S:  Shattuck?)  I could probably (--)  (S:  Dutton Street?)  You want to 
take a left in front of this Merit (S:  And then a right) Station and then there is a left turn and 
there is a big parking lot across there.  (S:  Okay)  Do you know where I mean?  I think that is 
where it is.  Take this (--)  Wait a minute.  It's behind those old mill buildings there.  Do you 
know that parking lot?
S:  Behind those old mill buildings?  Oh, okay.  You go down Dutton Street and take a left.  
Okay, I know where you mean.  [Coughs]  
D:  Does Ray Gagnon work full time?
S:  Oh Ray is retired.  He drives wheels, meals with wheels, or something like that (D:  Oh yeah, 
yeah!) for the elderly, or handicapped, or whatever.  And I guess he's bartending over at the place
on Lakeview Avenue and Colman Street.  I can't think of the name of it.  (D:  Oh yeah)  Part 
time, part time a little bit.
D:  Do you think he would be interested in talking to me about flies sometime?
S:  Oh sure.  Positively, positively.  I will give you his number.  (D:  Okay)  He is quite a talker 
too.
D:  Oh good, okay.  You are no slouch yourself.  [Laughs]
S:  Well you are talking hunting and fishing, you're talking right up my line.
D:  Yeah, yeah.
S:  I am happy when I am hunting, or fishing.
D:  Yes.
 
S:  I just wish more people would be willing to give a little more than they take (D:  Right, I 
understand) when they are fishing, you know.  Just a little time (--)
D:  Now you want to turn left here where that sign is.
S:  Yeah, right in that sign, Lowell National and State Parks.
D:  Yeah, right here.  (S:  Yeah)  Oh, what happened here?
S:  Looks like somebody hit the fence.
D:  I would say.  [Laughs]  Hit it pretty good too.
S:  I would say that machine there probably did it.  Don't know if one car did that.  Who did that?
[Background voice unclear]  I would guess that machine there made a mistake.
D:  Just go straight down here.
S:  Straight down, okay.
D:  Right here, I am sorry.
S:  You down at the end?
D:  I forget where I put it now.  You can pull right in here.  I can see my car over there.
S:  You can see it, okay.  Now this is handicapped, so I ain't pulling in here.
D:  Okay, well go around. 
S:  Are you on the other side?  Well I'll go right around, we will find it.
D:  Have you been through any of this new Park stuff yet?
S:  I am ashamed to say I haven't, no.  I have been waiting for my wife to feel better.  (D:  
unclear)  Up that way?
D:  Yeah, so I understand, yeah.  (S:  I've been waiting for my wife to feel better to take her 
down)  You can drop me right here.  This is fine.
S:  No, I will take you right up along where your car is, it don't make any difference.  
D:  Just pull in right here, this is good.
S:  Okay.
D:  I want to give you some stuff that I brought along to show you anyway.
S:  I just want to make sure that I got your (--)  Yeah, I have it all here.  I don't have Ray's 
number here.  I will have it for you.
D:  Would it be in the phone book?
S: Oh yeah, it will be in the phone book.  Ray Gagnon, 12 1/2 Third Avenue.
D:  Okay.  This is just a little flyer [rest of sentence unclear].
S:  Yeah, you probably, when you talk to him ask him if he wants to talk (--)  Tell him I took you 
out and showed you about the river.  You might add a little more to it.
D:  Sure.
S:  But he has quite a place where he does his fly tying in his house.  Christ, he has tied up in his 
house.  You know, he has got 
everything in there.  He has a little fly tying table and he has got walls of fly tying material and 
everything.
D:  Can you think of anyone else who would be good to talk too, who knows a lot about the 
river?
S:  About the river, gee, let's see.  There is a few people that should know a lot more about the 
river than I do.  Jimmy Lorrey would know a little bit more about the things than I do.
D:  How do spell him [unclear]?
S:  L-O-R-R-E-Y.  I am not sure where Jimmy lives now, but he is a postmaster in Tyngsboro, 
Mass.  (D:  Okay)  So you call up Tyngsboro Post Office and ask for Jim Lorrey.
D:  And he is quite a fisherman then, is he?
S:  Well yeah.  He is more of a hunter, but he does do a little fishing.  He is not much of a 
fisherman, but he knows a lot about the river, because he got involved, he was quite political.  
And he got involved in a lot of projects.  So he might know a few things that are going on that I 
don't know about.  In fact, I am sure he does.  I am trying to think of somebody else.  Larry Stott,
he works for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, but I don't, I doubt if you would get a hold of him.  He 
was the head of the Salmon Project.  One of the head ones on the Atlantic Salmon Project, you 
know, but you want mostly people in Lowell, in the area.
D:  Pretty much.  Yeah, we are sticking within the city limits.
S:  If I think of somebody I will call you.  I can get you at this number (D:  Yup) and leave a 
message for you.
D:  Get one of my cards here, here we go.
S:  Okay.
D:  I just wanted to explain what we are going to do with the tape here.  We have been 
interviewing a lot of people in Lowell about all kinds of aspects about what it is like to live here. 
About different traditions like hunting and fishing, but also about life in the different 
neighborhoods.  And now people personalize their yards and their neighborhoods.  And all kinds 
of things to get a better understanding of what Lowell is about.  And often times we tape record 
interviews as we have been doing today. Take photographs.  And these materials we make a cope
and take them to the Library of Congress in Washington and also another copy stays here in 
Lowell at the Mogan Cultural Center, which is now in the works I understand.  And these 
materials will be available for researchers who are interested in knowing more of what goes on 
here.  And I want to thank you for spending your morning with me and taking the time.
S:  I am only too happy to do it for conservation and fishing and yeah, I like that idea.  [unclear] 
you [unclear] you have shown me you are more interested in more than just the fishing part of it. 
A very out spoken person and he is running for councilor this year and there is his name right 
over there, Tarsy Poulis
D:  Oh yes.
S:  Have you heard of him?
D:  Yes I have.
S:  Well there is a good guy to talk too.  And I will tell you why he is a retired mailman.  Not 
because of that, but because all his life he has been especially, I will say the last twenty years 
anyways, this section over here is known as the Acre.  Now years ago I would say it was mostly 
Irish and Greek.  Now not many Irish and there are a few Greek and it is more Puerto Rican, 
Spanish, Loatian and whatever, you know, ethnic groups.  But this guy is the same as everybody 
else, except that he is dedicated and he can be wrong in points just like you and me and 
everybody else.  But he is doing what he thinks is right and his is trying to make a better 
neighborhood and he has tried for a long time.  A lot of people don't like him because he is very 
outspoken.  And like I said, he can say the wrong things, but most of his thoughts are for the 
good of the community.  This is very important.  Nobody is perfect, everybody makes mistakes, 
especially when they got a certain things on their mind, you know.
D:  Right.
