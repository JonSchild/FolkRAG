There's a 
charming little widow, 
'Who keeps a 
candy store 
Where the little children by their chewing gum; 
She sells taffy for a 
penny— 
Her name is on the door, 
There's music in the face of Widow Dunn. 
She's from the County Kerry, 
Her husband was a 
Tip, 
And in the English army beat a 
drum; 
A-singing Holy Moses ! 
Can't she give it lip— 
Such a 
voice has the Little Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
Aileen Allanna 
Starry Banner 
Slavery Days, boys— every one; 
She'd warble aisy—surely plase ye; 
Such a 
voice has the Little Widow Dunn. 
Repeat Chorus.

You should hear her at a 
party 
Sing " Brennan on the Moor," 
Just as stately as the Duke of Wellington ; 
She rises up the ceiling 
And shakes the parlor floor, 
Oh, everybody loves the Widow Dunn. 
She's a 
pretty little body, 
Just like a 
'
ristocrat, 
Wid eyes rolling over full of fun ; 
And she'd drink a 
glass of lager 
Just like a 
Democrat, 
It's pleasure for to meet the Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
Savourneen Deelish— Mother's Last Wish ! 
The Battle Over—Murphy's Won 
Do You Love Me—Moriarty ! 
That's sung by the Little Widow Dunn. 
Aileen Allauna, etc. 
Oh. she plays the concertina, 
Self-taught, without a 
book : 
She never told a 
lie, like Washington— 
She'd turn your head complately 
Wid a 
sly, bewitching look, 
Such a 
banshee is the Little Widow Dunn. 
She's so very fond of children, 
She sings them all to sleep, 
And gives them lollypops and sugar plums, 
Continued. 
At every neighbor's funeral 
She'd dross iu black and weep; 
Such a 
tender crature is the Widow Dunn.

The Little Duddeen—She's My Fairy Queen 
In the Ballet—Oh, Mary Bun I 
Keep My Grave Green—Sweet Evangeline! 
They are sung by the Little Widow Dunn. 
Aileen Allanna. etc. 
She'd read the " Ledger " stories; 
Wrote by Sylvanus Cobb; 
The " Daily News," the " Herald," and the " Sun ;" 
And at every passing stranger, 
She'd give her head a 
bob— 
So familiar is tha Little "Widow Dunn. 
She has a 
cure for measles, 
The chicken rash, and croup. 
And every summer morning in the sun, 
I
N,1 the neighbors babies 
Are sitting on her stop, 
Such a 
fairy is the Little Widow Dunn.

I'm a 
darling they say among the girls, 
The dear little creatures I 
love, 
As walking they go, sweet kisses they throw 
From my third story window above. 
When they roll up their dear little eyes. 
I 
would fall from the window and die; 
And all of the boys who envy my joys, 
Say, Danny, they give you the guy, 
Oh, G-irly-Girly! 
Will anyone name the clay ? 
Dolly and Kitty, and Mary so pretty— 
For gracious sake! take me away; 
Oh, Girly-Girly ! 
With love I

wen, 
Wid propriety in society, 
I 
walk among the fine gentlemen. 
Nicoll, the Tailor knows me, 
I 
open a 
basket of wine; 
To take out the straw to pad my coat more, 
I'm home in my bed about nine. 
When I 
walk for a 
day's exercise, 
The goggles are over me eyes ; 
I'll wrest13 and fall over top of them all 
Wid any man under my size. 
Oh, Girly-Girly, etc. 
My collars, the Dave Levrick style, 
Fresh from the laundry at Troy ; 
Oh, every old maid, who works at the trade, 
They say let him go, he's a 
boy. 
To Salt Lake I 
must emigrate, 
Great Caesar ! but I'll fascinate 
Every young girl with a 
bang or a 
curl, 
That swings on her father's front gate.

KENTUCKY ROSE.' 
With the compliments of the author of the words and musk, 
W ALTER BRAY. 
As sung with great success at HARRIGAN & HART'S Theatre 
Comique, 514 Broadway, N. Y. 
Oh, the rose of Kentucky and me, 
Long ago old mosso set us free ; 
I'll tell you what did happen in her good old mother's cabin 
To the rose of Kentucky and me. 
On the banks of the Ohio River, 
Where the winters are so cold the darkeys shiver; 
One night about eight, we joined the married state. 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
C 
Honus. 
On the banks of the river, that old muddy river, 
She lived on the banks of the river ; 
And one night about eight, we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
When they tried to win my Rose away from me, 
My wife alone she said she'd be ; 
Yet their vanity she flattered, and their hearts she always shat-
tered 
When they tried to play that game on me, you see. 
Her voice filled this darkey full of glee, 
She's as merry and as busy as a 
bee ; 
Illove when I 
look at her, she's black, but that's no matter, 
She's just the shade I'd have my darling, be. 
On the banks of the river, etc. 
Since I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife, 
We have lived together, free from care or strife; 
And it's natural to suppose, we had a 
little Rose, 
For so sweetly flowed the summer of our life. 
Yet the winter of our days will come, alas! 
When spring, summer and autumn, too, will pass ; 
Hand in hand we'll glide away, and I'll bless the happy day 
When I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife. 
On the banks of the river, etc. 
THE OLD WOODEN ROCKER. 
Written and composed by FLORENCE HARPER. 1. 
Music published by SPEAR St DEHNHoFF, 717 Broadway N. Y., 
Price 40 cents. 
Copyright 1878, by Harrison Millard. 
M sung by DICK DORNEY, the great Contortionist. 
There it stands, in the corner, with its back to the wall, 
The old wooden rocker so stately and tall ! 
With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom, 
For no one now uses that back parlor room. 
Oh, how well I 
remember in days long gone by, 
When we stood by that rocker, my sister and 1; 
And we listen'd to the stories that our grandma would tell, 
By that old wooden rocker we all loy'd so well. 
CHORUS. 
As she sat by the fire she would rock, rock, rock, 
And we heard but the tick of the old brass clock ; 
Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
/f this chair could but speak, oh, the tales it could tell, 
How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell ; 
'Nettth the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and true, 
lie cherished his freedom, the red, white and blue. 
It could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a 
bride ; 
This is why we all love it, this old chair grim and tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stands by the \\Tall. 
As she sat by the fire, etc. 
But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
her children have follow'd her, ycs, one by one, 
They have all gole to meet her " in the sweet by- and- bye," 
And all that is .eft is dear sister and I. 
Never more will NV2 hide her gold specs or her cap ; 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap ; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim aud tall, 
The old wooden rocker that stood by the wall. 
As she sat by the fire, etc.

Oh, Cranky. Sankey, Murky and Sang, 
Kinkey, Blinkey, Winky Bang, 
Could eat like any orang outang, 
Was a 
hungry man from Harlem. 
He eat a 
sheep he eat a 
ram, 
A bushel of pickles and half a 
ham, 
A pound of pork and a 
ton of jam, 
A 
shin of beef from Amsterdam ; 
He shut his jaw wito a 
terrible crash, 
And took in a 
couple of tons of hash, 
For his mouth it was a 
terrible gash, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He eat a 
horse, he eat a 
dray, 
He eat a 
train of cars one day, 
But the engine uncoupled and ran away, 
From this hungry man from 1Ihrl‘m. 
He eat his shirt, he eat his hat. 
Ile took in a 
bushel of mutton fat, 
A 
poodle dog and a 
Thomas cat, 
He reached for a 
camel, and swallowed a 
gnat. 
Then he hollered for shrimps and took a 
sneeze, 
And filled up his teeth on a 
barrel of fleas, 
And sweetened his breath on Limburger cheese, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
He'd a 
weakness for old ancient boots, 
Stockings and other kinds of fruit, 
Pigs head and gin he'd persecute, 
This hungry man from Harlem. 
One day he got so hungry, 
He drank up the beer in a 
brewery, 
With a 
barrel of glue, but it didn't agree, 
So he determined to kill himself felo de se, 
Then he swallowed a 
drug store, bottles and all, 
And hollered New York from Summer till Fall, 
And committed suicide by sitting down on a 
shoemaker's 
awl, 
This hungry man from Harlem, 
BEANS. 
This beautiful production was composed while ingurgitating 
a 
quantity of this very delicious Boston fruit. 
In Boston City lived a 
nice young man, 
He was awfully fond of beans; 
His salary was small, but his appetite large, 
And he lived beyond his means. 
He had beans for breakfast, beans for dinner, 
And cold baked beans for tea ; 
Says he, how I 
wish I 
was a 
great big bean, 
How happy I 
would be. 
He'd stand and gaze for hours and hours; 
In the window of a 
bean-i-
ree; 
, 
The most dog gondest cur for beans 
That ever you did see. 
His mother said when he was young; 
He'd never eat cakes or creams, 
But was sure to wake up in the middle of the night, 
Crying mammy, I 
want my beans. 
This bean destroyer is now content, 
He's got a 
bully job; 
He's head bean-slinger in a 
dining saloon,' 
He is, so help me Bob. 
Where his rich, sonorous voice is heard, 
Now daily as he screams, 
At the top of his voice, with his mouth chock full 
beaus, beans, beaus.

BARBARA FRIETCHI.E. 
Written by JOHN G. 
WHITTIER. 
Recited by the Great VON BOYLE. 
UP 
from the meadows rich with corn, 
Clear in the cool September morn, 
The clustered spires of Frederick stand, 
Green-walled by the hills of Maryland. 
Round about them orchards sweep, 
Apple and peach-trees fruited deep, 
Fair as a 
garden of the Lord, 
To the eyes of the famished Rebel horde, 
On that pleasant day of the early fall, 
When Lee marched over that mountain wall-
Over the mountains winding down, 
Horse and foot into Frederick town. 
Forty flags with the silvery stars, 
Forty flags with their crimson bars, 
Flapped in the morning wind; the sun 
Of noon looked down and saw not one. 
Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then, 
Bowed with her four score years and ten, 
Bravest of all in Frederick town, 
She took up the flag the men hauled down. 
In her attic window thc staff she set, 
To show that ONE HEART was loyal yet. 
Up the street came the rebel tread, 
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead. 
Under his slouched hat left and right 
He glanced; the old flag met his sight. 
" 
Halt !"—the dust-brown ranks stood fast, 
" 
Fire !"—out blazed the rifle blast ; 
It shivered the window, pane and sash— 
It rent the banner with seam and gash. 
BARBARA. FRIETCHIE. 
Continued. 
Quick, as it fell from the broken staff, 
Dame Barbara snatches the silken scarf; 
She leaned far out on the window sill, 
She shook it forth wtth a 
loyal will. 
" 
Shoot, if you must, this gray old head, 
But spare your country's flag," she said, 
A 
shade of sadness, a 
blush of shame, 
Over the face of the leader came; 
The noble nature within him stirred 
To life at- Barbara's deed and -word 
" 
Who touches a 
hair of you gray head, 
Dies like a 
dog 1 March on !" he said. 
All day long through Frederick street, 
Sounded the tread of marching feet— 
All day long that free flag tossed 
Over the heads of that rebel host ; 
Ever its torn folds rose and fell 
On the loyal winds that loved it well ; 
And, through the hill-gaps, sunset *light 
Shone over it with a 
warm good night. 
Barbara Frietchie's work is- 
o'er, 
And the rebel rides on his raids no more 
Honor to her 1 
and let a 
tear 
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier. 
Over Barbara Frietchie's grave, 
Flag of Freedom and Union wave 1 
Peace and order and beauty draw 
Round thy symbol of light annaw; 
And ever the stars above look down 
On thy stars telow at Frederick town. 
THE LOST GOAT. 
Words and music by Tim ROGERS, and sung by him with great 
success at the Novelty Theatre, Brooklyn. 
I 
am much abused man and terrible broke up, 
Now listen to me and my trouble I'll tell ; 
I 
had a 
fine goat, he was fit for a 
queen, 
And was as big as a 
cow, and his name was Bill. 
I 
left him last week on the hillside a 
grazing, 
Eating sweet lilies, and timothy hay ; 
And some dirty loafer with talking and coaxing, 
Induced my poor billy goat far, far away. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my 
have you seen billy, 
My dear little billy goat, cushla machree;? 
Some dirty loafer with talking and coaxing, 
Put salt on his tail and coaxed him away. 
Now where shall I 
go ahar, do tell me that, 
I've been walking all day, I 
am as weak as a 
cat; 
I 
am hungry and played out, I'll give ye a 
note, 
If any of you tell me where I'll find my goat. 
Gentlemen, tell me, oh, do for my sake,

MERRY SAILOR LAD. 
Sung (in character) by Miss CLARA MOORE. 
OH, I'm a 
merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and free; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
Where the bounding billows rear their heads, 
To play with the tempest cloud ; 
(Hurried music.) 
To play with tempest cloud 
And the storm's deep voice come o'er the main, 
In murmurs hoarse and loud. 
Oh, I'm a 
merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and feee ; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea ; 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea. 
CHORUS. 
Huzza ! huzza! my heart beats glad, 
Who would not be a 
sailor lad ; 
Who would not be a 
sailor lad, 
Who would not be a 
sailor lad ? 
I 
love to tread the vessel's deck, 
Amid the howling gale, 
And listen to the sea gulls' scream, 
And to the thunder's wail. 
And to the thunder's wail, 
And to the thunder's wail.

Hurried flash MUSI

And watch tne vivid lighting play 
Around me bold and free, 
Around me bold and free. 
Oh, some may love the dull tame shore, 
But an ocean life for me.

merry sailor lad, 
With a 
heart both light and free, 
I 
dearly prize my gallant ship, 
I 
love the deep blue sea ; 
I

I 
love the deepiblue sea.

Respectfully dedicated to LITTLE MINNIE, by E. 
F. 
II. 
I 
know a 
little darling, 
She lives not far away ; 
Her eyes are bright and sparkling , 
She's always light and gay. 
Her cheeks are red as roses, 
While her chin with dimples part 
Oh, she's a 
little daisy, 
And the sunshine of my heart. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
We often wander thro' the woods 
In the gentle twilight glow; 
And there we whisper of our love, 
While walking to and fro. 
We 
sit beneath some shady tree, 
And there we talk and spark ; 
Oh; she's a 
little treasure, 
And the sunshine of my heart. 
Oh, Now I 
feel as happy, 
As a 
king upon his throne; 
For she has told me truly 
That she will be my own. 
So we will live together, 
Never more to part; 
And she will be forever 
The sunshine of my heart.

MORE LIKE Ills DAD. 
Originally sung by NED BARRY. 
They say as the cock crows, the young one will learn, 
At least it's been so in my case ; 
For ever since I 
can remember, I 
know, 
I 
always have been a 
scapegrrce. 
At garroniug people I 
took a 
delight, 
And when I've played some little game, 
Whenever I've gone hoate and acquainted my (lad, 
lie's always been sure to exclaim--
CHORUS. 
You get more like your dad every day, 
You get more like your dad every day ; 
When some trick l've played, he will say you young 
jade, 
You get more like your dad every day. 
I 
Was barely fourteen when I 
started a 
pipe, 
And also to court I 
began ; 
I 
went to saloons and called for my beer, 
And fancied myself quite a 
man. 
I 
remember the first time my friends saw ma home, 
I 
had to be carried to bed ; 
Instead of chastising, my dad only smiled, 
And said as he shook his old head— 
You get more, etc. 
I 
am now most addicted to flirting aud fun, 
In fact I 
make love to excess ; 
And have promised to marry so many dear girls, 
At last I've got into a 
mess. 
There are Susan and Annie, and Florence and Kate, 
Who've all had a 
promise from me ; 
And when I 
told father he roared with delight, 
And cried with a 
slap on his knee— 
You get more, etc. 
A :HUNDRED YEARS AGO. 
Written by CHARLES ARCHER. 
Sung by NED BARRY. 
The songs and poems ev'ry night, 
You hear upon the stage ; 
80me artists sing and some recite, 
Of every clime and age. 
So, if the favor you'll confer 
Attention to bestow ; 
l'd like to speak of the men that were 
One hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, 
A 
hundred years ago, 
I'd fain refer to the men that were 
One hundred years ago. 
Sweet Erin's famous to this day, 
For whiskey, love, and mirth; 
'Tis the home of hospitality, 
That gave St. Patrick birth. 
The home of Robert Emmet true, 
And O'Connell, well, we know, 
That Irish Patriots wern't so few 
A hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, etc. 
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO, 
Continued. 
Old England bad her heroes brave, 
Whose names shall ever stand, 
With gallant Nelson's on the wave, 
Lord Wellington's on land. 
And France can boast Napoleon, too, 
Cambrou with hair like snow, 
And Ney who fought at Waterloo, 
Near a 
hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago. etc. 
America should ne'er forget 
The men she held so dear ; 
Thank God! their names are living yet, 
And will for many a 
year. 
Mad Anthony Wayne, and General Lee 
The terror of the foe ; 
George Washington, none great as he, 
One hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, etc. 
The trials of that gallant band, 
I 
need not stop to tell ; 
They struggled hard, they freed the land, 
And the flag we love so well. 
The stars and stripes shall ever wave, 
Nor ever be laid low ; 
While we've men as true, and hearts as brave, 
As one hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, etc.

KEEP your eyes upon us, children from the South, 
We're as merry as the little birds singing on the

Our hair's so tight we cannot shut our mouth, 
And we're always just as happy as can be. 
Then, dancing, laughing, jumping all the day, 
Music makes us foolish as the chickens in the hay; 
Then, singing, shouting, to pass the time away, 
We're two happy little children from the South. 
When us darkies we give a 
fancy ball, 
They watch us Diggers as we promenade the hall ; 
Singing, dancing, we can beat them all. 
For we're two happy little children from the South.

NO SMOKING ALLOWED. 
Sung by NED BARRY, with great success. 
The poets have sung about women and wine, 
But smoke is the theme of this ditty of mine, 
I 
look on my pipe as a 
trusty old friend, 
Who's faithful whatever luck fortune may send ; 
Wherever 1 
travel, north, east, west or south, 
I've always a 
pipe or cigar in my mouth, 
For when I 
am smoking I'm up in a 
cloud, 
But of course never go where no smoking's allowed. 
CIIORUS. 
No smoking allowed, what a 
terrible sell, 
When they put out my pipe I 
am put out as well, 
No smoking allow, what a 
terrible sell, 
When they put out my pipe I 
am put out as well. 
One day by express on the Great Eastern line 
I 
started lo visit an old friend of mine, 
I'd lig,hied my pipe and was watching the curl 
Of the smoke when there popped in a 
pretty young girl. 
I 
cried smoking car, the train was just off, 
Of course I 
could not make the dear creature cough. 
So I 
put down my pipe and submissively bowed 
To my fate which I 
felt was no smoking allowed. 
I 
looked at the ceiling I 
fear with a 
frown, 
Then looked at the lady, of course she looked down, 
I 
offered the paper, of weather I 
spoke, 
And talken about steam, thought I 
thought about smoke. 
S3 charming a 
damsel I'd ne'er seen before, 
But soon I 
admired her fifty times more ; 
One small remark proved she with sense was endowed, 
Said she, go on smoking, sir, smoking's allowed. 
In comfort the rest. of the journey was passed, 
I'd met with a 
sensible woman at last, 
And now we are married, I 
oft say in joke, 
Our doubts and our sorrows have ended in smoke, 
She knows that those ladies who smoke cannot bear, 
Have husbands who takes pipes and glasses elsewhere, 
So ladies pray try to get used to a 
cloud, 
And don't join the cry of no smoking allowed:

M. H. FOLEY in " Uncle Ike's Jubilee." 
A 
HAPPY colored man am I, just three score years I've 
seen, 
I

The gospel train will come along, bound for the other

COUGH, JOHN 
.uki-H, AND MAKE THE BABY 
LAUGH. 
As sung by NED BARRY, with great success. 
You see that I'm a 
married man, at least I 
think you ought, 
By eighteen months of wedded bliss some trouble I've been 
taught, 
Pm father of a 
bouncing boy who's always wide awake ; 
And I've to cough to keep it quiet until my jaws they ache. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I'm the happy parent of a 
crying doll 
I'vc 
bought rattles, India rubber tooth- rings, sugar- sticks, and every-
thing else I 
could think of, but it is impossible to keep the child 
quiet, except in one manner ; and that is why my wife is al-
ways crying out— 
Citolles. 
Cough, John, cough, John, cough, and make the baby laugh, 
Cough, John, cough, John, and make the baby laugh, 
Why don't you keep it still ? it's crying makes me ill, 
Cough, cough, cough John, and make the baby laugh. 
Some call the baby pretty pet, and ask us out to tea, 
Where I've to act the part of nurse, and dance it on my knee ; 
My wife she sits down with the rest to have a 
good blow out, 
But as the blessed infant squalls, to me she's sure to shout— 
Cough, John, etc. 
I 
never get a 
wink of sleep, for when in bed at night, 
The baby's sure to waken up, and cry out with affright ; 
My wife commands me with one word, and then begins to snore 
While I've to hug that wretched child about the chamber floor

I DON'T LIKE A CUR AT MY HEELS. 
Words and Music by FRED. BOULARD.

Publishing Co., 32 Beekman Street, New York. 
As suit by NED BARRY, with great success. 
I 
like honest pluck in this warfare of life, 
No matter whoever I 
meet ; 
I 
like a 
man boldly to say what he thinks, 
And not fill me with hollow deceit. 
It may not be pleasant at all times to hear 
The truth plainly told in your ear ; 
Yet ' tis better to know you're prepar'd for the worst, 
Than tremble like children with fear. 
Clloitus. 
do like a 
man that will boldly stand up, 
And tell me at once what he feels, 
can fight with the lion that roars in my face, 
But I 
can't bear a 
cur at my heels. 
t 
like to be told of my faults like a 
man, 
And I 
ne'er knew the man who had none ; 
Hard words may be used, yet I 
like him the most, 
Who has pluck all my faults to make known. 
If wrong I 
can cure the foul slander at once, 
Aud destroy every venomous part ; 
Yet I 
reel when a 
Judas, who smiles in my face, 
Gives a 
stab at my back in the dark. 
I 
do like a 
man, etc. 
So behind a 
man's back always mind what you say, 
if you can't do him no good, do him no harm ; 
If you don't like back-biting, don't do it yourself, 
And your good name will spread like a 
charm. 
We all have to live, so let's try and make life 
A good open field for the race, 
And if you have cause of complaint ' gainst man, 
Go tell him right straight to his face. 
I 
do like a

I SAY PETER, DON'T YOU LOOSE YOUR 
TEMPER. 
W ritten by G. 
V. 
PAGE, and sung by NaD 
BARRY. 
I 
am the very mildest man, 
You'd meet for many a 
day, 
I'd go through life devoid of strife, 
in a 
meek and gentle way. 
But my wife, aggravates me so 
With rage, she makes me hot, 
By trying to make out, that I, 
Have a 
horrid temper got. 
SPOKEN.— And that's enough to make anybody mad, 
now, naturally I 
have a 
most peaceful nature, butter 
wouldn't melt in my mouth (it never gets the chance 
lately, for all the butter is bosh,) but my wife has a 
knack of provoking me, and when I have arrived at 
boiling point, she mildly observes— 
CHORUS. 
I 
say, Peter I 
don't you lose you temper, now then 
Peter ! promise me you won't 
You may lose your watch, lose your chain, lose your 
purse, or lose the train 
But don't you lose your temper, Peter I 
ducky, darling, 
don't 
At home the children, always howl, 
The chimneys always smoke, 
The rooms are always filled with soot, 
Which goes beyond a 
choke (joke). 
The cistern's always running dry, 
The ceiling running wet,

The clocks are always running down 
And I 
always run in debt. 
SPOKEN, —HOW would you like 
it, eh? morning, 
noon, and night, something going wrong. Now, I 
sutler 
from a 
bunion (I 
may say a 
John Bunyan, for it makes 
my walk a 
Pilgrims Progress.) 
Well, whenever I 
com-
plain of anything my wife dances on this bunion, and 
mildly observes--
I 
say Peter, etc. 
My wife pulls such a 
lengthy face, 
Domestic ills about ; 
That, for the way she serves me in, 
I 
thought I'd serve her out. 
I'd give her cause to sigh, and cry, 
Some temper she should show, 
And as she often got me out, 
Why out I 
meant to go. 
SPOKEN.- 011t on the spree, I 
mean, and I 
did, 
too,

thing, train included, home with the milk, wife on the

sick friend," " Don't tell me, you midnight ranger ! 
won't live with you, I'll go home to 'ma, 
I'll have a 
seperation !" " You can have what you like" said I, 
but— 
CHORUS. 
I 
say, Sarah ! don't you lose your temper, I 
say, Sarah 
promise me you won't; 
I've lost my watch, lost my chain, lost my purse, and 
lost my train, 
But don't you lose your temper, Sarah ! ducky, darling

THE GREAT MEN THAT IRELAND HAS SEEN. 
As sung by the Great Motto Vocalist, NED BARRY-. 
Now since I 
appear here, before you once more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile, 
Tho' years now have passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cling to the dear native Isle ; 
And I'll sing of old Ireland, the land of my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
Whose deeds of renown, shall shine round each heart, 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CH0RUS. 
Then here's to the sons of old Erin Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green. 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all history does show 
\Vas a 
statesman, whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
Be died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
And then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foeman would quake, aye, and tremble and shake, 
When his war horse would enter the field ; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moore, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
lint though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We have men that would die for their country to- day, 
And a 
Parliament wish of their own ; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancour or spleen, 
But when honor demands them, they valliantly fight, 
Like the great men that Ireland has seen. 
W HAT COULD YOU WISH FOR MORE ? 
As 
sung by NED BARRY. 
It is a 
doleful story I 
am going for to tell, 
About a 
fair young damsel who lived in Clerkenwell, 
Here parents were not honest or particularly poor, 
They got their Tommy on the cross, 
And what could you wish for more ? 
CHORUS. 
Then what could you wish for more, my boys? 
What could you wish for more ? 
Oh, now a 
story I 
will tell of a 
damsel and swell, 
And what could you wish for more ? 
This damsel's name was Mary Ann, though most folks called 
her Poll. 
In face and form she was as fair as any rag- shop doll, 
Her lovers could be counted at twenty to a 
score, 
nit in love she fell with a 
gay young swell, 
And what could you wish for more ? 
In course ofc • time they married, from then no joy they kncw, 
He whacked Tier with a 
poker and he whacked her with a 
shoe, 
Each day they fought till one was stretched all senseless on the 
floor, 
They found their pokers just the weight and what could they 
wish for more ? 
Each day they raved and yelled and screamed, 
Till both became quite hoarse. 
And then they went before the judge and asked for a 
divorce, 
His honor said such cases he had often heard before, 
So he parted this fond loving pair, 
And what could they wish for more? 
The swell resolved on suicide, but hadn't got the pluck. 
He tried to walk into the river, but in the mud he stuck, 
Then Polly went and fished him out, 
And dragged him to the shore, 
And they both lived happy after that, 
And what could they wish for more ? 
WE ARE GWINE AWAY. 
Written by C. II. SHEFFER, and sung with great sutcess by 
FoLEY & SHEFFER. 
On, good evening white folks, one and all, 
We ask your attention for awhile;

We hope you'll like our old plantation style, 
Down on the Mississippi, where we were bred and 
born. 
CHonus. 
But now -

We ain't got long to stay. 
So fare you well white folks, one and all. 
How often we'd go up on the deck, 
'Twas then the moon was shining bright; 
We sang dar our good old nigger songs, 
And den we jump and dance with all our might, 
The white folks used to laugh, and clap their hands 
so loud, 
They'll make us sing and dance again, 
Then didn't we feel proud. 
CHORUS. 
But now we're gwine away, 
We ain't got long to stay, 
So fare you well white folks, one and all.

THE SQUIRE AND MARIA. 
As sung by NED BARRY. 
A 
Squire went a-courting, a-courting of a 
maiden, 
A 
maiden, young and handsome, the Squire he was 
old ; 
A 
Squire went a 
courting, courting of a 
maiden, 
The maiden she had golden hair, the Squire had the 
gold ; 
He'd gold at his banker's, gold in every pocket, 
His snuffbox eighteen carat, his cigar case made of 
gold; 
The girls name was Maria, and the iich old country 
Squire, 
Took a 
fancy to Maria—the truth it must be told. 
CHORUS. 
Said the Squir.) to Maria " Your charms I 
do admire, 
You've have set my heart on fire, I 
love you tho' I'm 
old," 
" 
Oh ! Squire," said Maria, " you're something I re-
quire—" 
She had one eye on the Squire, and the other on his 
gold. 
The Squire he was seventy, the maiden she was seven-
teen— 
That's about the age, they say, that girls begin to 
love. 
The Squire be was seventy, the maiden she was seven-
teen, 
The Squire called Maria, " His little turtle dove." 
Now a 
young chap, called Josiah, was courting of Maria, 
But never to the Squire, Maria ever told 
How she doated on Josiah—for understand Maria, 
Knew the rich old country Squire had a million 
pounds of gold. 
For the Squire, etc.

The Squire said, " Maria, whatever you require 
You shall have, dear Maria, if you'll name the wed-
ding day." 
The Squire thought to try her, Maria she was fly ' cr 
Than the Squire or Josiah, so to him she did say— 
" 
Tho' it may cause me sorrow, I'll marry you to mor-
row, 
A wedding dress I'll borrow," so the Squire she 
cajord, 
Then the Squire. gave Maria—he did her so admire— 
An order on Squire for a 
million pounds of gold. 
And the Squire, etc. 
Next day, in gay attire, Maria and the Squire 
A 
parson did require, to make them into one ; 
Then home they did retire—Maria and the Squire, 
But the Squire did expire in the middle of the fun. 
Then Maria said, " Go wire a 
message to Josiah 
And tell him that the Squire is defunct, and lying 
cold," 
And the next day young Josiah was married to Maria, 
And the festive gay Josiah got the mflion pounds of 
gold. 
CRORY:S. 
Said Josiah, to Maria, " you settled that old Squire," 
Maria said, f` Josiah, the Squire was too old ; 
Believe me, dear Josiah, I'm glad he did expire, 
All I 
wanted from the Squire was his million pounds

GET THEE GONE , 
MAN. 
Written by NED Goss. 
AIR.— Isle De Blackwell. 
Oh, a 
curious story I 
wish to relate, 
That happened way over in Michigan state ; 
It's of a 
young damsel I'll now tell to you, 
That lived with her parients in Kalamazoo. 
Of course they were wealthy, of money had much, 
Her father was Irish and her mother was Dutch, 
Whenever I'd call on her the old man would frown, 
Spoken.—And say: 
Get thee gone; man, get thee gone, man, 
And you bet the man would get thee gone. 
Oh, this damsel was handsome, the fairest e'cr seen, 
Her nose it was red, and her eyes it was gre?n ; 
Her teeth they were freckled, she'd a 
wart on her ear, 
And then such a 
great mouth for Millwaukee beer. 
She'd a 
hump on her back like a 
big cam-mi-mile. 
She was cross-eyed in both feet, to see her you'd smile, 
When e'er I'd call on her the old man would shout, 
Get thee out, man; get thee out, man, 
And you bet the man would get thee out.

BABY MINE. 
One of the greatest hits made by Goss &: Fox, at the Theatre 
Comique, New York. 
Written expressly for them by CHARLES GLIDDEN. 
I'VE a 
baby in Kalamazoo, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
He can skip the tra-la-la-loo, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
He swings on our back gate, 
Tackles peaches by the crate, 
On a 
fishball he can skate, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
He can eat a 
barrel of cake, 
Baby mine. 
He makes faces at the women, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
In a 
soup bowl he goes swimming, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Out of the ash-pan we do yank him, 
In his high chair we do plank him, 
Oh, heavens how we spank him, 
Baby mine—by mine; 
His face would cave a 
bank in, 
Baby mine. 
At the table he is queer, 
Baby mine—baby mine; 
stuffs the pan-cakes in his ear, 
Baby mine—baby mine. 
Rubs molasses on his nose, 
Spills the mustard on his clothes, 
He jabs the hash between his toes, 
Baby mine—baby mine, 
And we wash him with a 
hose, 
Baby mine,

HERE SHE GOES AND THERE SHE GOES. 
Originally sung by NED B RR V, at the Theatre Comque, Broad-

Brown, 
They asked papa to give consent, but he only gave 
frown; 
Now Tom and his Ameli 
town, 
And married be, although 
Brown ; 
The very morning of their 
would stay, 
I 
know they only wished 
away. 
SPOKEN. —I 
knew the boy loved the girl, and the old 
man didn't love the girl worth a 
cent. 
The old man 
was a 
kind of sporting man, and so, I 
says, Brown, old 
boy, I 
want to lay you a wager. 
What is it ? says 
Brown. 
I 
want to bet you five dollars you can't swing 
your arm with the pendulum of that clock five minutes. 
Done 
says he, I 
take the bet. 
What have I got to 
do ? 
All you have got to do is to follow me and go 
like this— 
a 
for some good chance to run 
said that they'd elope to 
it was against the wish of 
flight, old Brown at home 
CHORUS. 
Here she goes and there she goes, bib a-de-bob, bib-a-
de-bob, 
Here she goes and there she goes, and that is the way 
to do it. 
Old Brown he set to work at once and soon began to 
puff. 
I 
cried old Brown. I 
think that you'll soon say you've 
had enough ; 
I 
never laid a 
bet, said he, but what I 
mean to win, 
I'll bet another ten, said he, that I 
will not give in; 
Continued. 
Old Brown was fat, the weather warm, and never once 
he stopped, 
And there upon his heated face there stood the shining 
drops. 
SPOKEN. —
And I 
stood in the corner laughing; and 
old Brown still kept up the same old game— 
Here she goes; etc. 
Mrs. Brown who heard me laugh, came into the room 
to see, 
Oh ! goodness gracious, Brown, said she, what can the 
matter be ? 
Why, Brown, you must be going mad, of that there is 
so 
no doubt, 
To stand in front of that old clock and swing your arm 
about; 
I'll go and fetch the doctor, Brown, if you go on this 
way, 
But all they could get out of Brown, and this is what 
he'd say— 
Here she goes, etc. 
Old Brown he won the wager, but lost his daughter by 
the game, 
She married Tom in town that day. and back for for-
giveness came ; 
'Twas useless when the job was done for Brown to then 
say nay, 
So he took the joke, my friends, in quite a 
jolly way ; 
He gave a 
party to his friends and °filmes tells with glee, 
While sounds of laughter echo from the jolly company. 
SPOKEN--Yes, says the old man, I 
shall never forget 
the time I 
went— 
Here she goes, etc.

I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
'Tis a 
letter that I've treasured many years 
Oh ! how often I 
have read those fading lines 
And over them there's traces of my tears. 
She sent me her blessing in that missive, 
To see me was her constant holy pray'r. 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
Is a 
lock of my angel mother's hair. 
CHORUS.

letter that I 
keep with tender care, 
The little lock of gray in this old letter, 
is a 
lock of my angel mother's ha:r, 
I've a 
letter that was written long ago, 
That was sent to me across the stormy sea ; 
When ' niong strangers I 
was wand'ring far away, 
And longing home again to ever be. 
But under ,
_leath the sod my mother's sleeping, 
She's free from earthly trials and its care, 
But ever next my heart I'll keep her letter, 
And the lock of my angel mothers hair. 
I've a 
letter that was sent, etc.
