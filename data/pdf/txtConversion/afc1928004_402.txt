CHARLEY FLYNN-. 
Sung by M ARRY BEICSETT_ 
I'LL ask consideration, friends., 
And I 
will let you know 
That I 
am saluted by the gang 
Wherever I 
may go. 
1 
live- in eighte-
en. " carrot " style; 
I 
drive a 
trotting mare; 
I 
smoke Flora de five per cent. cigars, 
And singe'my curly hair. 
CHORUS. 
Charley Flynn, Charley Flynn, 
Wears the latest style of collars, 
chancy Flynn, Charley Flynn, 
Worth one hundred thousand dollars. 
When I 
go out to walk, 
My shirt as white as chalk, 
The gang say clear the way, 
For here comes Charley Flynn. 
I'm known in all the social clubs, 
I 
live on oyster stews, 
I 
can pivot on a 
three cent piece, 
And dance the Lanciers too. 
And oftentimes I 
make a 
speech, 
Of course on politics, 
And when I 
say a 
little too much, 
I 
get a 
shower of bricks. 
Charley Flynn, etc. 
WE ARE THE MEN FOR THE PLACE. 
Written and sung by HARRY and JOHN KERNELL. 
No doubt you have heard of the Delanies, 
The men who were tall, lank, and lean; 
They were the smartest men ever left Wexford town, 
And the biggest liars that ever were seen; 
They came to America on a 
horse's back, 
And on the ocean with a 
ship ran a 
race. 
SPOKEN.—And if you want two men that can walk one hun-
dred miles in the short space of twenty-four hours, we are the 
men can do it. 
We can sing, dance and outwhistle any other 
men from the same county in Ireland; and don't forget that if 
you want governors or constables, or two men that can vote 
three times in every ward on election day, send for us. 
We 
can clean out a 
first-class lunch table in ten minutes. I 
tell 
you we are the bone and sinew of the Democratic party, and 
we can pull more planks from under the Democratic party than 
any other two men from Maine to the Pacific slope, and if you 
intend opening a 
saloon, send for us; if you intend opening a 
a 
jail, you can bet we are the men for the place. 
CHORUS. 
We are the men for the place, 
We are the men for the place; 
With a 
shovel or pick, 
Or two rale Irish Micks, 
We are the men for the place. 
When we came to America, long ago, 
And stepped on your great Union land, 
It was us that started the first hand organ, 
And opened the first peanut stand; 
We were the originals of the ten cent balloon— 
Tom Collins put a 
stamp on your face. 
SPOKEN.—And if you want a 
couple of actors to play in Jack 
Sheppard, we are the Inen for the place. 
We are the men, etc,

CAPTAIN CUFF. 
As sung by Wm. SCANLAN, with great success. 
Some folks go in for whiskey, 
Some for most unpleasant dogs; 
Some fellows have a 
fancy 
For the most outrageous togs. 
I'm very gone on linen, yes, 
And wouldn't give a 
dollar 
For life, without a 
splendid show 
Of snow-white cuff and collar. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentleman, for my great desire for 
linen, I 
have achieved the great and glorious title of — 
CHORUS. 
Captain Cuff I 
Captain Cuff! 
You can tell me by my collar; 
Captain Cuff, Captain Cuff, 
Though I'm not worth one half dollar; - 
I'm awfully stiff in style, 
My cigarette I'll puff; 
Then hi 
hi I 
clear the way, 
Here comes Captain Cuff. 
Sometimes a 
common fellow 
Of the lower order class, 
Will dare make some rude remark, 
Or mock me when I 
pass. 
And lots of vulgar little boys, 
They know me well enough, 
And oft salute me as I 
pass, 
‘rith what cheer, Captain Cuff. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
With darling eyes upon me, 
Through life I 
gaily march. 
My style shall be the stiffest; 
My motto shall be starch. 
Should my cuff and collar glory, 
Be ever gone and fled, 
You'll know that Captain Cuff's gone wrong, 
And his washerwoman's dead. 
Captain Cuff, etc. 
A recitation delivered all over the United States by W M. 
SCANLAN, in Wm. SCANLAN'S original sketch, entitled 
PREPARING FOR THF STAGE. 
As performed by SCANLAN k 
CRONIN, the celebrated Versatile 
Sketch Artists, Vocalists and Dancers. 
One summer day, long, long ago, 
When I 
was a 
li Ale fellow, 
A piper wandered to our door, 
Grey-headed, blind and yellow. 
And ah! how glad was my young heart, 
Though the sky and earth looked dreary, 
When I 
saw the stranger and his dog, 
Poor Pinch and Keoch O'Leary. 
And when he stowed away his bags, 
Crossed barred, green and yellow, 
I 
thought and said in all Ireland's ground, 
There's not so fine a 
fellow— 
And Fenian Burke and Shaun McGee, 
And Eily, Kate and Mary, 
Rushed in with panting heart to see, 
And Welcome Keoch O'Leary, 
Well, Keoch and Pinch slept well that night; 
And in the morning early 
He woke me up to hear him play, 
The wind that break the barley. 
Then he stroked my flaxen hair, 
And murmured Mack you deary, 
And how I 
wept when he said farewell, 
And think of Keoch O'Leary. 
Well, twenty summers have gone past, 
And June's red sun was sinking, 
When, a 
man, stood by my door, 
Of twenty sad things thinking. 
A 
little dog came up the lane, 
His steps was slow and weary, 
And at his tail a 
lame man limped: 
'Twas Pinch and Keoch O'Leary. 
Keoch 
But ali 1 
how wobegone— 
His form is bowed and bending. 
His fleshless hands are thin and wan, 
And time is ever blending 
The color of his thread bare bags; 
And Pinch is twice as hairy, 
And thin-spare as when last I 
saw, 
himself and Keoch O'Leary. 
(The old man enters). 
God's blessing here! the wanderer cried. 
Far, far! befell black viper; 
Does anybody here about, 
Remember Keoch, the Piper? 
yes, yes! I 
said; the old man wept 
As if his heart was breaking. 
And where avie maehree, he cried, 
Is all the merry making 
I 
left here twenty years ago ? 
My. .'0,1e I 
sighted might weary; 
Enough to say, there's none but me, 
To welcome Keoch O'Leary. 
Woe I 
woe! the wanderer cried, 
And wrung his hands in sorrow. 
Pray lead me in, asthore rnachree, 
And I'll go home to- morrow; 
My peace is made I'll calmly leave, 
This world so lone and dreary, 
And you can have my pipes and dog, 
And pray for Keoch O'Leary. 
With Pinch. I 
watched his bed that night, 
Next day his prayer was granted. 
He died, and Father James was called, 
And the requiem mass was chanted. 
The neighbors came, we dug his grave 
Near Eily, Kate and Mary. 
And there lie sleeps his last sweet sleep. 
God rest you, Keoch O'Leary, 
Written by W ILLIAM SCANLAN, and performed by the great

No. 50 Fourth Street, Cincinnatti, Ohio. 
The subject to- night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you proves untrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share: 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN.—I explained the matter to her the other evening, 
and when I 
had finished, she looked into my face this way, and 
said, that's nothing— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last WeetC, 
You may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said what do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
And the last words I 
could hear whilQ there was— 
CHORE'S. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
No matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
I'll follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And my burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
SPOKEN.—Yes; I 
shall haunt her day and night if its only to 
hear her say— 
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
Written by Wm. SCANLAN for W ILL H. 
M ORTON. 
While sitting at home by the fire one night 
Thinking of past events, 
I 
surmised how a 
man could fight the hard times, 
If he'd save his dollar and cents. 
No matter how much for his labor he got, 
If to save he'd only contrive, 
In the course of time, if he felt so inclined, 
His coach and four he might drive. 
CHORUS. 
Then save all the money you can, my boys, 
No matter how much it may be ; 
A 
dollar when wanted, ( if course you can't doubt it) 
Is a 
good thing to have you'll agree. 
How often in life, as we journey along, 
A man we will meet on the way; 
He'll ask you to lend him a 
dollar, please— 
" 
I'll return it some future day." 
" 
My friend," you will say, as ,you turn away, 
" 
I'm sorry : but really, I'm sure. 
If I 
had a 
few cents I 
would give it to you. 
Your appearance tells me you are poor. 
Then save, etc. 
You take a 
young man who goes round with the boys, 
And spends all he earns for their fi'm; 
He's the best in the WO lcl %, bile his money he throws 
Across the bar for their segars and rum ; 
But when he goes broke, they'll quick turn their backs, 
Unnoticed they'll all pass him by! 
If you doubt what I've said to- night in my song, 
To satisfy yourself go and try. 
Then save, etc. 
Now you take a 
young man who saves his money, 
He's envied by those who have none; 
They'll turn up their nose as by them he'll pass, 
Their envy and spite he has won. 
Why? Because he has sense and keeps far away 
From those who to vice him would lead; 
He accumulates wealth, good habits and health, 
And never fears want or need 
Then save, etc.

No doubt you will wcnder why I 
dress so gay, 
Always in fashion this swell of the day. 
My clothes they are cut in the latest of style, 
And the darling young ladies on nie fondly smile. 
My way is so winning, full of exquisite grace, 
Why they really do laugh when we meet face to face. 
The gents they all look with derision at me, 
Because I 
am always dressed up to a 
T. 
CHORUS. 
While pivoting, waltzing in the grand dance so gay, 
At sweet Saratoga or Far Rockaway. 
Oh I 
the darling young ladies say I 
am a 
dear, 
Why none's half so charming as Clarence Lavere. 
On a 
nice afternoon if the weather is fair, 
To my barber's I 
go to curl up my hair, 
Brushoff my clothes fix myself all serene, 
For I 
always endeavor to look bright and clean. 
I 
am a 
good hand at billiards and like my good wine s 
A card player, well I'm considered quite fine. 
I 
never borrow trouble, always feel well, 
And a 
good joke I'm always quite ready to tell. 
While pivoting, etc 
At a 
quarter of two I 
must be ofi Broadway, 
, 
To meet a 
young lady I 
saw the other day 
Her pa he is rich—so at least I've been told— 
And all I 
desire is to grab at his gold. 
Then to the sea- beach in summer I'll go, 
Cut such a 
dash, ah what a 
show. 
There in the ball- room to promenade and dance, 
With any young lady I 
meet there by chance. 
While pivoting, etc.

Broadway. New York. 
Price 35 2ents. 
Well there, now! did you ever ? 
Ma says I'm dreadful bold, 
Because when men come ccurtmg, 
I'm ot resery'd or cold. 
Now, gents, pray tell me, would you have me 
Make a 
face that's wry ? 
Or when you ask me once to kiss you, 
Like a 
fool to cry ? 
SPOKEN.—No, no I 
I'm sure you would rather I'd say 
CHORUS. 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Bless me, Bob, don't be so shy; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Once more only love to try; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
the height of true love's bliss; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
No joy equals love's fond kiss. 
Bob says not to mind mother, 
When she was young like me 
She ne'er tho't men a 
bother, 
Or married would not be; 
And so I 
thought if men would follow, 
I'd not say them nay. 
Nor for my mother, or any other, 
Bid them turn away. 
SPOKEN.-But I've made up my mind that when the right one 
comes along, I'll say  
think that tob means business, 
Tho' not much yet he's said, 
But truly, from his actions, 
I 
think he means to wed. 
Now should he ask me if I'll have him, 
I'll not bid him wait, 
And say the sea holds plenty fishes, 
For oft we lose our bait. 
SPOKEN.-Oh, yes, I 
tell you, these giddy girls who keep 
saying, " There's just as good fish in the sea as ever were 
caught!" they forget that sometimes they lose their bait. 
Not 
for me! 
Oh, no! 
I'll continue saying  
Keep on kissing me, etc.

Milk and honey, Oh! its funny— 
I 
cannot keep from dancing; 
For I 
love a 
girl—she's a 
pretty pearl— 
A 
lovely belle supreme— 
She's a 
lolly- pop—sweet forget-me-not— 
And her voice is so entrancing, 
She's my honeycomb, she's my sugar- plum, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Yes, she's a 
basket full of fruit, 
She's my pretty love, she's my turtle.dove. 
Her voice is like the music of a 
flute, 
And she's just sweet sixteen. 
CHORUS. 
Milk, honey, strawberries and cream (sym.), 
Like the music of a 
happy dream (sym.). 
She's a 
darling! she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
lovely plate of peaches, 
She's a 
dandy—'lasses candy— 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Repeat Chorus. 
I'm enraptured, I 
am captured, 
By a 
lovely lump of sweetness. 
She's an oyster pie,- she's a 
chicken pie, 
And she haunts my every dream. 
She's a 
little maid, she's aleMonade, 
And the pink of perfect neatness. 
She's a 
box of dates, she's a 
bunch of grapes, 
She's strawberries and cream. 
Ohl yes, she's far too sweet to live, 
Is this lolly pop, is this candy shop, 
And her loss I 
know that I 
would grieve— 
Sweet vision of my dream.

Have you ever been to the opera 
When the darling young ladies were there, 
It was there I 
met one evening 
A 
lady so charming and fair. 
Her eyes were as bright as the stars 
That twinkle and shine up above, 
And I'll ne'er forget the evening 
That first I 
met my love. 
C 
HORUS. 
She's as fair as a 
lily, 
Gentle as a 
dove; 
Looks like a 
little star 
Twinkling above. 
I 
love her dearly, 
I'd die for her sake; 
There iS none hi this wide world 
Like my love Katie. 
If you over should see this young lady, 
In love with her you'd surely fall; 
She's always dressed up in fashion, 
In size she's not small nor yet tall. 
She is just as pretty as a 
picture, 
You'd travel for miles to see, 
And I 
don't mean to flatter myself, but 
She's awfully gone on me. 
She's as fair, etc. 
If it's my luck to marry this creature, 
For ever how happy I'll be; 
To sit at home of an evening 
With a 
nice little boy on my knee, 
To hear him call me his papa. 
Well, enough I 
think I 
have said, 
The rest I 
shall tell you some evening 
After Kite a&I I 
are wed.

Ohl I'm a 
noble soldier brave, 
Just from the war where the banners wave; 
I'll fight as long as I 
can see, 
Or stand behind a 
barn or tree. 
You bet I 
am a 
handsome man, 
And when I 
went away, 
It nearly broke the ladies' hearts; 
But now they often say, 
Oh my! they cry, Oh! who is.he ? 
SPOKEN.—Don't you know him ? 
Oh yes, he is— 
CHORUS. 
Captain Spike the musketeer, 
The pet of all the ladies dear, 
A 
gallant soldier of renown, 
The gayest man in all the town. 
Don't speak of Hildebrandt Montrose, 
You'll make the red come off my nose; 
Hold on, I 
want to speak to you, 
Of something now that is quite new, 
I 
met a 
charmer the other day, 
Outside a 
Broadway car, 
My hat I 
raised and sweetly asked, 
If she was going far; 
Oh my I 
she cried, Oh! who is he?

am—

RIDING ON THE RAILWAY. 
Written by D. A. KELLY. 
Sung by COLLYER & KELLY. 
While riding on the railway cars the other day, 
A very funny incident happened by the way; 
A woman, with a 
large market basket on her arm, 
Got on at a 
way station, convenient to a 
farm. 
She put the basket under a 
seat, and then she raised her vail, 
And turning to me, asked Is this the Morning Mail? 
I 
told her that it was, and settled for a 
nap, 
When suddenly in my face I 
felt a 
most tremendous slap. 
CHORES. 
In the railway to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, which I 
now will show to you. 
I 
turned to the lady, and inquired the cause. 
You dirty loafer I 
she says to me, Its very well you knows ; 
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, to treat a 
lady so. 
Says I, Madam. what I'm guilty of I'm sure I 
do not know. 
She sat down in her seat, then rose wain in haste, 
And says. Is there a 
gentleman will save me from this baste? 
Or bring me a 
policeman, for sure as eggs is eggs, 
I'll have this brute arrested for tickling of my legs. 
In the railway etc. 
The color rose to my cheeks, I 
swore it wasn't so, 
And asked if anyone would for the Conductor go. 
The Conductor he arrived, asked for an explanation. 
The old lady told her story, without any hesitation. 
The Conductor tried to calm her—she was at fever heat— 
She wouldn't listen to him till he pulled from under the seat 
Her great big market basket, and then, how very shocking! 
Discovered a 
big rooster, who'd been picking at her stocking. 
CHORUS. 
In the railway, to the north, let it hail, rain, or snow, 
Along the iron railway, like lightening we go. 
That a 
man should be blamed for what he does not do 
Is certainly very hard, as I 
now have shown to you.

Of John Reilly's Buck Goat I 
will tell, 
And the troubles which he did cause. 
It would take a 
whole yob-
Juin to tell 
The way in which he transgressed the laws. 
He was the terror of the whole neighborhood, 
Divil a 
one would come near him at all. 
A 
policeman, who swore fight him he would, 
He ate up coat-tails and all. 
Ca 
ORITS. 
Bad luck to that Goat--
The dirty old bloat! 
He ate Reilly's pants, 
And swallowed his coat; 
He ate forty candles, 
And twenty pump-handles, 
And ready for more 
Was John Reilly's Buck Goat. 
The people all rose up one night, 
Swore the Goat they would kill upon sight 
Next day, in a 
body, after taking their toddy, 
They went for the Buck Goat to fight. 
The Goat met them as they came down the street, 
He let fly with both his hind feet: 
When the battle was over the Goat was in clover, 
For he was the king of the strait.

'Th. Goat felt so proud 
Of bating the crowd, 
He ate a 
shoemaker, 
By the name of Pat Dowd; 
Be 
ate the leather, the lasts, 
An.d the twenty-four pails, 
And,finished with a. keg 
Of ten-penny nails. 
Then up stepped brave,Miehael McNalley, 
Who coriaered the Goat in an alley. 
-They fought forfour hours, &II cithen,,by the powers, 
Divil a 
thing was .there left of McNally. 
It was then that I' threw off my coat, 
And swore I 
would murder the Goat, 
Who took a

And that was the end of the Goat.

PRETTY LITTLE TOMMY, 
Written and sung by BRN DODGE: 
One afternoon as down the street I 
rambled, 
My attention was attracted by a 
crowd 
Of people, who with open mouths were list'ning 
To some language, which to me seemed very loud; 
It issued from a 
chap upon the corner, 
A 
fellow who was overstocked with cheek, 
He'd a 
little rubber toy which he was selling, 
And he said it was a " Tommy with a 
squeak." 
SPOKEN.—He pulled a 
string, causing the little rubber 
toy to move its arms and legs ma ridiculous manner, and 
at the same time to utter a 
very peculiar little squeak; then 
the gentleman would turn round to his audience and say— 
CHORCS. 
Will you buy a 
little Tommy with a 
squeak, squeak, 
squeak, 
Pull it for a 
week it will squeak, squeak, squeak; 
Buy a 
little Tommy with a 
squeak, squeak, squeak, 
Pretty little Tommy with a 
squeak. 
I 
purchased one, it was so very funny 
That I 
couldn't keep it hidden out of sight, 
At home we had a 
little boy in trowsers, 
Who had suffering been, and crying all the night; 
And the cause, I 
found, of all his youthful sorrow 
Was, he'd had the stomach-ache for near a 
week, 
But he laughed so loud, the pain at once departed, 
When I 
let him take the " Tommy with a 
squeak." 
Will you buy, etc. 
For some time I 
have sojourned in this city, 
And of course I 
have been looking out for fun, 
I've desired with the girls to get acquainted, 
But they " turn me the cold shoulder "—every one; 
There is one by whom I 
have been captivated, 
And though to gain her notice I 
did seek, 
She somehow frowned on all of my advances, 
Till I 
showed the little " Tommy with a 
squeak !" 
SPOKEN.—That " broke the ice," for she turned around 
with an angelic smile and murmured— 
Pretty little Tommy, etc. 
Now advice in this matter I 
will give you, 
And I'm certain you.will find it true indeed, 
If you try, and cannot win a 
girl's affections, 
Buy a 
little rubber toy, and you'll succeed; 
For if when to plead your cause you would endeavor, 
Should the lady blush and hang her head so meek, 
She'll quickly smile and whisper yes so sweetly, 
When you show the little " Tommy with a 
squeak !" 
Will you buy, etc.

In your path through life each day, you will meet upon the 
way, 
Fellow mortals upon whom this world cloth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or by circumstances crushed and striken down; 
young men with blighted names, who once had noble aims, 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save, from a 
dark, dishonored 
grave, 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
sneer, 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone; 
You know not what's in store, for the loved ones you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own, 
The shop girls on the street, with as much respect should meet, 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny hand, 
They too have hearts and feelings—yes, and souls; 
Their family is as dear to them as any here, 
Though their clothes may be all ragged, torn and old, 
23 
Dejected and forlorn, yet, still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful hom3 and gold. 
They are all to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak a 
gentle word in soothing tone; 
You know not what's in store, for those whom you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own, 
Don't despise the wretched poor, whom perhaps grim want 
may lure, 
To steal the bread their starving children crave, 
Be not the one to blame, you yourself would do the same, 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once like 
you, 
Respeeted and beloved by one and all, 
Who no doubt through care and strife, or some sorrow of their 
life, 
Have fallen, but rot quite beyond recall. 
And the poor outcast forlorn, don't pass them by with scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone: 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of sin and shame, 
Remember you have children of your own. 
All LING'S TRUE LOVE. 
Written by R. 
J. 
PIGOT, for CHARLES KONOLLMAN, the 
popular comique, and sung by lum with immense success. 
(Air—" Lover's Telegraph.") 
In Baxter street there lived a 
man, 
A Chinaman, I 
mean, 
Who was dead in love with a 
black and tan. 
A 
coon named Susie Green ; 
This Chinaman, by name Ah Ling, 
Would fight all day for Suse, 
lie went to see her every night, 
To drive away the blues. 
One night Ah Ling went to her house, 
To ask her if she'd go, 
With him unto the Chinese ball, 
But Susan answered no ; 
Says Ling ' What is the reason, Sue, 
That you won't go with me ?" 
"My husband said if I 
shou1,1 go. 
He'd br( ak my head," sobbed sit. 
Poor Ling it almost broke his heart, 
To think that he should lose, 
The lovely one whom he adored— 
His own beloved Suse; 
Says he to her, " We'll Inn away, 
And doss the sea so blue," 
They sailed away—the ship got lost, 
,And that was the last of the two." 
UNFORTUNATE CUSS. 
Sung by J. D. hoomE. 
I'm an unfortunate cuss as ever you did see: 
I 
loved a 
gal, her name it was Sal, but she didn't love me; 
For she had another fellow, and he was a 
regular beat, 
He was chief engineer of a 
peanut stand, and he sold them on 
the street. 
But if ever I 
catch that fellow, there's one thing I 
can tell, 
I'll make him look blue, that's what I'll do, and he'll wish he 
was in—well, 
Jerusalem, or some other place, or that he had never been born, 
For I'll knock out his eye with a 
cranberry pie, and give him a 
bust in the horn. 
She's fat, ragged, saucy, and tall, and she wears a 
big water. 
fall; 
She's a 
healthy dead beat, and me she did cheat, but I'll get 
square for all. 
I 
bought her a 
new set of teeth, and I 
gave her a 
camel's-hair 
shawl ; 
She looks very neat, all but her big feet, and them she'll never 
make small. 
For she goes out every night, walking with this feller. 
Ice-cream and pig's feet, every night he will treat, down in a 
lager-beer cellar. 
But I'm bound to be revenged, for to me he's done plenty; 
I'll go and get tight, and I'll kick up a 
fight, on his eye I'll put 
a 
big shanty. 
I'll make her give back them teeth, and everything that I 
bought her. 
She tries to be gay, and she's old enough to chew hay, and be-
, sides she's a 
fisherman's daughter. 
She ought to go peddling fish, and live on pump water; 
She wont have any teeth to chew up her hash, and I 
don't 
think that she ought to. 
So:when she meets this pea- nut peddler, she can tell him what 
I've done; 
If he comes around here, I'll bite off his ear, and then I'll have 
lots of fun. 
So I 
think the best thing she can do, is to start for Salt Lake 
city; 
I'll give her a 
dollar a 
week, and all she can eat, if she will kilt 
herself just out of pity.

My name it is Stokes, and at Putney I

And on Tower Hill I've a

I 
am a 
dry- salter in quite a 
large way, 
A 
very dry salter I 
think I 
may say. 
I 
always am down in the city at nine, 
And unless I 
come home in the evening to dine, 
My dear little wife really makes such a 
fuss, 
So I 
soothe her by catching the Five o'clock ' Bus. 
CHORUS. 
For the five o'clock ' bus, there are thirteen of us, 
And we start from the bank in the five o'clock ? bus. 
For the five o'clock ' bus, there are thirteen of us, 
And we start from the bank in the five o'clock ' bus. 
The five o'clock riders are all city gents, 
Who talk about shares and the new three per cents, 
Each day the same lot of old gentlemen ride, 
And the five o'clock ' bus carries thirteen inside; 
One evening when starting—depict our dismay, 
When our old conductor quite slily did say, 
" 
Would any gent here like a 
lady to nuss? 
For there's one wants to go by the five o'clock ' bus." 
For the five o'clock ' bus, etc. 
The old buffers smiled, and the old buffers frowned, 
And then came some chaff about handing her round, 
For the five o'clock ' bus was so full, don't you see, 
It was plain she must ride on some gentleman's knee; 
The lady was pretty, and young, it was clear, 
And so we all said, " Come and sit here, my dear! " 
She giggled and blushed, and she might have done wuss, 
For she sat on my knee in the five o'clock ' bus. 
For the five o'clock ' bus, etc. 
I 
chatted and talked to the girl all the wavy, 
And slily arranged I 
would meet her next day, 
But when I 
alighted and rung at the ber 
I 
found the young woman was waiting as well; 
I 
shook in my shoes with a 
horrible doubt, 
I 
feared she had come there to let it all out, 
But my wife, when she saw us, said, " Very odd, Gus, 
Here's our new servant come by the five o'clock 'bus." 
For the five o'clock 'bus, etc. 
Now I 
never can look that young girl in the face, 
For if she but tells, I 
shall get in disgrace, 
I 
am chaffed all the way, till I 
reach my abode, 
For somehow the story's got known on the road; 
Then old city gentlemen, be careful, please, 
And don't let a 
young lady sit on your knees, 
Or you'll have to put up with the chaff and the fuss, 
How about the young girl and the five o'clock ' bus. 
For the five o'clock 'bus, etc,

AWFULLY AWFUL, 
Written and composed by G. 
W . 
HUNT. 
Sung by LYDIA TUOMPSON. 
They tell me I 
am too bashful by far, 
Arid, sometimes, I 
think they are right, 
But so awfully naughty the masculines are, 
No wonder one feels in a 
fright; 
I've been led to believe men were born to deceive, 
So when they, their compliments pay, 
In language absurd. I 
don't hear a 
word, 
But, first, as a 
caution I 
say. 
Cuonus. 
Go away, get along, go along, get away 1 
You don't say what you mean, or mean what you say, 
Go away, naughty boy, go ever so far, 
You are so awfully awful, you are! 
When I 
go to a 
ball, and one asks me to dance. 
At the finish I 
soon slip away, 
For I 
know Mr. Noodle, if he has the chance, 
Is sure to have something to say; 
So I 
stop the sad man, as soon as I 
can, 
In case he'd be going too far, 
Perhaps what he'd tell me, he has told two or three, 
For such sad Don Giovanni's they are. 
Go away, etc. 
I 
dread Christmas time, whene'er it comes round, 
Tho' it's awfully jolly, I 
know, 
But so many young men, again and again, 
Lead me under the mistletoe; 
Oh! and would you believe, on last Christmas eve, 
I 
found a 
young man at my feet, 
With an offer of marriage, a 
mansion, and carriage, 
Of course, I 
soon beat a 
retreat.

Will you keep me, love, in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
While other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinicing of the days that Lave been, 
There's one little wish I

At the break of dawn, 
From a 
sleep never troubled by drialtiiiigf 
Atid greet with delight; 
The glorious sight, 
Of the sun with its early bethriing. 
A 
meal filet' I 
make, 
That a 
giant might take', 
For of good things' I 
know I'm a 
lover; 
I 
saddle my horse, 
The country to cross, 
And away on my nag to the cover,

Yo, ho 1 Tally ho!

Over bush, over brake and thro' briar; 
Then whop can there 134, 
So happy alid free; 
As a 
jolly old country squire'. 
The bedewed ground yields, 
As we dash thro' the fields, 
With vigor and life both bounding; 
The mare, with a 
snort, 
Seems eager for sport, 
As *he huntsman's horn is resounding, 
We both sniff the air, 
Such a 
jovial pair, 
Its a 
regular hunting day, boys. 
An old one is found, 
We are off with a 
bound, 
Yoieks 1 
tally hol and away, boys, 
Yo, ho, etc. 
Then hark I

The old fox must die, 
Tanhoy I 
yo, ho 1 
boys, hie over; 
Gates and hedges we clear, 
And our horses we cheer, 
As we all dart away from.the cover. 
Then thro' branches and bush, 
Fearing nothing we rush, 
Over meadows—thro' woodland go tearing. 
At the death to be in, 
And his brush, boys, to win, 
Not a 
fig for the danger caring. 
Yo, ho, etc. 
If your life you'd enjoy, 
And you'd still be a 
boy, 
Copy me, and be up in the morning; 
And don't be abed, 
With a 
dull sleepy head, 
And spend half your lifetime In yawning. 
Buy a 
rattling horse, 
His back jump across, 
you haven't got one—why then get it; 
Rise up with the sun, 
And 
het ten to Poe, 
That you never will ay you regret it.

A

But gaze on her and sq'squeeze her hand.

And asked her if she would name the day, 
To make o'one of us t' two.

" 
What claim have you, sir, to my hand?" 
Then l'looked like this, you understand— 
No doubt all of you d'do. 
I 
may not, etc. 
I 
said, " I 
don't claim anything, 
I 
merely wish the belle to ring;"

But answered in tones so s'sweet and bland—

I

She can have her choice as to 
where she'll live, either Shoreditch or Trafalgar Sq'Square, or 
some other watering place, I'm not selfish. 
She mustn't say, 
if I

I 
hate that. 
And if I

THE MINSTREL'S DREAM. 
An original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense 
success. 
One eve while sitting in my chair before my fire so bright, 
Its rays dispelled the midnight gloom, and lightened up the 
night, 
My thoughts reverted to the past, and brought before my gaze, 
The shadowed forms of minstrels great, the kings of by-gone 
days; 
I 
saw the people laugh and cry, as alternately they gave— 
The merry pun, the mirthful joke, the ballad sweet and grave, 
They formed a 
quaint procession, as they passed before my 
sight, 
The minstrels of our former days, thus conjured from the night. 
I 
saw George Christy shake the bones, sweet mnsic from them 
drag, 
And how the audience it would roar, as he told each merry gag, 
Saw " Daddy " Rice in ecstaey, those legs of his to throw 
The father of the minstrels—he who danced the first " Jim 
Crow ;" 
Heard Mulligan, with towering form, pathetic ballads sing, 
When Long John opened once his mouth, ' twas down the house 
he'd bring, 
Stevie Rogers gave his excelsior clog, the greatest ever seen, 
And other well-known faces came to fill my minstrel's dream. 
Nelse Seymour showed his giant form, and passed me by and 
smiled, 
A 
friend to eyery one in need, the minstrel's favorite child, 
35 
How oft I've heard his merry laugh, a' he made the night pass 
o'er, 
Give out the joke which ever set the audience in a 
roar; 
He scarcely disappeared when came the minstrel king and 
man, 
The glory of the boys in black—the mer/rlaughing Dan, 
As Bryant passed me by, his face with radiance seemed to 
beam, 
Ile cast a 
brilliant halo upon my minstrel's dream. 
Young Jerry, of the Bryants, too, with bones and tamborine, 
Recounted every great success in minstrelsy he'd seen, 
Billy Manning, of Chicago fame, then passed me swiftly by, 
And Unsworth gave his great stump speech, in which he the 
world defied; 
Jimmy Bradley danced his unequalled jig, familiar to us all, 
Billy Pastor sang his comic songs, and was many times recalled, 
Eph Horn, the last bright face I 
saw, he threw a 
radiant gleam 
Upon the spirits who had gone to fill my minstrel's dream.

JOCKEY CLUB BOUQUET. 
Words by ROBERT W ORDEN, of W ORDEN & MACK. 
One evening in July, 
When the sunset gilt the sky, 
And the little birds were warbling 'mid the trees; 
I 
met a 
maiden fair, 
With wavy golden hair, 
Who seemed to lend a 
perfume to the breeze. 
Her eyes of dreamy blue, 
Her cheeks of brilliant hue, 
And a 
merry song she warbles all the day; 
Her name she would not tell, 
And as I 
loved her well, 
LI 
christened her my Jockey Club Bouquet. 
CHORUS. 
It's true I'm deep in love, (
break) 
I'll win the girl, by Jove, (break) 
For she's promised to be mine, 
Before the Winter time, 
And don't I 
wish to see the wedding day; 
For her name she will not tell, 
And as I 
love her well, 
v ve christened her my Jockey Club Bouquet. 
She is as gentle as a 
dove, 
And bashful as her love, 
And says that I'm an impudent young man; 
And when I 
ask a 
kiss 
From this charming little miss, 
She tries to hide her face behind her fan. 
But if my wooing thrives, 
And the wedding day arrives, 
And to the church with me she'll gaily trip away; 
Why, if the fun you'd view, 
I'll introduce to you— 
My charming little Jockey Club Bouquet. 
It's true, etc, 
MY LOVE SHE IS A 
FAIRY QUEEN 
Sung by Miss Limn] HOLLYWOOD. 
My love she is a 
fairy queen— 
About her face no paint is seen; 
Iler pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall ; 
Her ankle, too, so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat; 
Were I 
a 
bee upon her lip, 
I'd stay all day and sip, and sip. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she never flirts—she's no coquette ; 
She never scolds, nor does she fret; 
She's some on style, and full of fun ; 
" 
You bet your life," she's number one. 
I 
took her to a 
show one night, 
I 
almost knew 'twould please her quite; 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
flow Dice I 
felt I 
scarce can say ; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose ; 
A man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
inile to my love ho gave a 
smile. 
Oh, she never flirt?, 4:4 . 
To see my love, next day I 
went— 
To pop the question was my intent; 
Alas 
poor me, I 
felt quite sore 
To hear she'd gone in a 
coach and four; 
Her mother squealed and I 
did squall i 
She'd took her trunk and waterfall ; 
I 
seized my hat—to the show I 
ran, 
put she'd eloped with a 
circus man t 
Oh, she never flirts, Sfc, 
TUMBLING ON THE SANDS. 
Composed by HARRY WooDsoN, and sung by the GIRARD BROS. 
Good evening to you, one and all, good evening, 
We're glad to see your smiling faces here, 
We've just arrived from Alabama this morning; 
To sing and dance, and make ourselves feel quer; 
We also come to tell you of a 
pleasure, 
Which both of us two niggers think is grand, 
And that is on a 
starry moonlight evening, 
The fun you have while tumbling on the sands. 
CHORUS. 
It's a 
pleasure that we colored folks delight in, 
A 
better one you never can demand; 
It makes yrou lively as the lightning, 
The fira you have while tumbling on the sands. 
We now think you for your kind attention, 
And ask you all to come some day, 
We'll try our best to gain your approbation, 
In the acrobatic biz we do display; 
Before we go, we want you to remember 
There's nothing half so nice in all the land, 
For a 
jolly time to exercise your muscles, 
As the fun you have while tumbling on the sand. 
It's a 
pleasure, etc.

DESCRIPTIVE SONG. 
Sung originally by FRANK LEWIS, at the Holliday Street 
Theatre, Baltimore, Md. 
In New York they had a 
carnival which did not come off well, 
Like man, things in that great town, " King Rex" was but a 
" 
sell ;" 
Mr. Barnum will ten thousand give, if he can run across 
And find the mystery of the age—the long-lost Charley Ross. 
They say that three beds you must have if iquor you will sell, 
The law of the Excise reads you must keep a 
large hotel; 
You dare not to a 
laborer a 
glass of lager give, 
In fact a 
workingman has now no earthly chance to live. 
You know there's been a 
mighty strike throughout our own 
dear land. 
And brothers fought with brothers brave, when as foemen they 
did stand; 
'Twas not against the soldiers the strikers stood at bay, 
But the railroad kings who grind them down to seventy cents 
a 
day. 
We ask for peace and friendship, and hope none will destroy 
The flag that now protects our land— both woman, man and 
boy; 
We also ask that rich men all a 
fair day's pay will give, 
For it's only right a 
workingman should have a 
chance to live. 
Our great Beecher he a 
sermon preached, a 
few short years 
ago, 
That men should guns to Kansas take, to shoot down every 
foe; 
T 
thought it a 
strange doctrine (scarcely Christian, by the way,) 
That he should think the laboring man, who gets but a 
dollar a 
day, 
Should live on bread and water, with his wife and children 
dear, 
While he himself does drink his wine, and thousands gets a 
year; 
Let him try bread and water once, and a 
new sermon he will 
give, 
He'll say it's right a 
workingnan should have a 
chance to live. 
Conversational Duet and Dance. 
Composed by 
ROLLIN HOWARD. 
As sung by the FOY SISTERS. 
BERTHA.—Coming through the fields to-day, 
A 
charming sight to see ; 
The violets seem to scent the air, 
And that a

That name first made mc fall in love 
With a 
bit of a 
coquette; 
Who could help it, or would rove 
From little Violet.

I

Felt pleased when he called oae " love" 
And little Violet. 
Duet, Chorus, &c. 
BERTHA.—Lucky accident, fair maid, 
This meeting, now, with you.

OH my heart is filled with joy, 
I 
scarce know what to say, 
About my darling blue-eyed Nell, 
I 
think of night and day; 
'Twas on a 
Sunday that we met, 
Among the sweet grape vines, 
And the little birds were singing forth, 
Their sweet harmonieus rhymes 
CHORUS. 
I 
feel just as happ: as a 
little rose bud, 
That blooms down in the shady dell, 
The sun shines from the sky so bright, 
On toy darling little blue.eyed Nell. 
We met last night as usual, 
And we greeted each with smiles, 
I 
popped the question o 
her, 
Then I 
knew she would be mine. 
Now oft I 
think of days gone by,1 
When first in love I 
fell, 
With this charming little creature, 
Now my darling blue-eyed Nell.

Words by JOHN M. 
TURNER. 
Sung by J. D. ROOM& 
Good evening folks, I 
have just dropped in 
To play for you, and to swing my chin; 
If I 
don't suit, just call 
Police!" 
And bind me over to keep the peace, 
Or lay me up on the mantel piece. 
My song relates to a 
youth named Slade, 
And biting pies was this young man's trade; 
He could bite any pie that he ever yet saw, 
Whether baked in the oven or served up raw, 
Fricasied pie from the hardware store. 
CHORUS. 
For he was a 
youth without reproof, 
He'd gobble a 
pie with a 
Mansard roof. 
A 
pie- us man was this youth named Slade, 
With a 
specialty act in the pie-biting trade. 
Pies one foot thick were nothing to him— 
he'd open his jaws and in they'd skim; 
Canned tripe pie just suited his taste, 
And a 
Washington pie he ne'er would waste, 
For he would stow it away in haste: 
DIA baker's pies he did most despise. 
Because he said they were stuffed with flies. 
His principal act was to stand on his eye, 
And catch in his mouth a 
home-made pie, 
For this young man was terrible fly. 
For he was a 
youth, etc. 
This mournful tale I 
must now conclude; 
If I 
stay longer you'll think me rude. 
But before I 
go I 
must here relate, 
That biter of pies' deplorable :ate, 
Which happened precisely as I 
state. 
He made a 
match, to his friends surprise, 
To bite through ninety plates and pies; 
But those big pies were stuffed with sand, 
And they gave him a 
walk in the promised land; 
Zo he's got a 
date you will understand. 
For he was a 
youth, etc. 
STILL THEY COME, 
Sung with immense success, by HARRY MONTAGUE. 
(Music of this popular song can be obtained from SPEAR & 
DEHNHOFF, 717 Broadway, New York, Harry Montague's sole 
publishers.) 
I'm a 
victim of fate, now my woes I'll relate, 
You'll really be sorry for me, 
For when sorrow I 
sup, next day I 
get up, 
Then I 
have it for dinner and tea. 
Some folks take their ills, one by one, just like pills, 
But I 
usually swallow the box. 
First it rains, then it pours misfortunes by scores, 
And calamities follow in flocks. 
CHORUS. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Troubles and bothers, one after the other, 
Still they come, still they come— 
There's nothing but trouble for me. 
I 
wish I'd been dead on the day I 
got wed, 
'Twould have saved me a 
terrible life, 
For nobody knows what I 
could disclose 
Concerning the friends of my wife— 
There's my mother in-law, and her sisters a 
score, 
And relations a 
wonderful share. 
They come, and they stay, and they won't go away 
For no matter how „many are there. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Uncles and cousins, and aunts by the dozen. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Boarding and lodging with me. 
once thought I'd enjoy, a 
sweet baby boy, 
To cheer me, and cause me delight. 
I 
didn't mind two, and with four I 
could do, 
And I 
thought that with six I 
was right ; 
I 
put up with my fate when the number was eight, 
But the tenth brought me sorrow and woe, 
For now she begins—just think 1 
to have twins, 
Although I 
may try all I 
know. 
CHORUS. 
Still they come, still they come— 
Doctors and nurses, and babies; I 
cusses ; 
Still they come, still they come— 
A 
very large family for rue. 
By HARRY BENNETT. 
I AM fond of courting, also of sporting, 
I 
often go courting the girl I 
adore; 
Her hair she does crimple, her cheek has a 
dimple, 
Her nose has a 
pimple five days out of four; 
Her first name is Mary, her last name is Cary; 
She never gets airy, the dear little sprite; 
She's pretty, she's witty, the belle of the city, 
And walks like a 
kitty, with step prim and light. 
CHORUS. 
Have you seen Mary, light as a 
fairy ? 
Never contrary, sings like a 
canary 
From old Tipperary; she works in a 
dry, 
And never gets weary, my sweet Mary Ann. 
Her voice is soprano, she plays the piano, 
The " Star-Spangled Banner" is the song she sings • 
Her style would amaze ye and set ye all crazy, 
With the songs of this daisy the neighborhood rings; 
Her appearance is dashing, she dresses in fashion, 
She's the darling for mashing the boys ev'rywhere. 
We're soon to be married, too long we have tarried; 
Four years she has carried a 
lock of my hair. 
Have you seen Mary ? etc.

A DANDY and a 
lady's man has come before you now, 
A man of taste and culture, for ' tis written on my brow ; 
In Irish circles I'm the pet of all the ladies fair, 
And I 
always meet with favor and a 
hearty welcome there. 
The reason must be obvious, I 
don't make use of slang; 
I 
use well chosen language, which surprises all the gang. 
You'll often hear the ladies say, " Now hasn't he the tone ? 
He ought to be a 
counsellor, George Constantine McKeown." 
I'm in the book and picture trade, T 
canvas every day; 
And tho' the times are very hard, I 
always make it pay. 
The literature of Ireland I 
have at my command, 
And when I'm talking up a 
trade my style is great and grand; 
I 
tell them how brave Sarstield fought and kept the foe at bay, 
And how the women held the fort at Limerick town that day 
I 
get them all excited, for I 
am no dunce or drone; 
You'll hear them cry, " I'll take four books, George Constantine 
McKeown." 
You ought to hear me make a 
speech about election time; 
I 
overflow with eloquence, with anecdote, with rhyme ; 
My attitudes are picturesque, and I 
can plainly show 
That I'm the Irish orator, the Celtic " Cicero." 
Some try to imitate me, but their show attempts are vile; 
They cannot catch my lofty tone, my grand imperious style. 
Let spurious imitators fall, for equals I 
have none; 
1 
am the great original, Georgef_knistantine McKeown.

The smartest of them all, 
And round the area windows

His music was so lively, 
All the latest airs front France, 
The servant girls could not keep still, 
The music made them dance.

Plays her many a

When I 
was a

was brimful of fun, 
For all sorts of tricks I 
was noted 
From morning till evening I 
never was done, 
On rollicking pleasure I 
doted. 
I 
tried ever' game. and when winter time came, 
With joy I 
was all in a 
flutter, 
Then out on the ice, Oh, I 
tell you ' twas nice, 
I 
went skating on one in the gutter. 
CHORUS. 
Skating on one, skating on one, 
Oh, boys, there was never such glorious fun; 
All other pleasures of youth I 
would shun, 
And go skating on one in the gutter. 
I 
beat all the boys with my far-fetching stride, 
In fact I 
was never artistic; 
While backward and forward so graceful did glide, 
I 
thought every motion majestic. 
I 
cared not to skate on the rink or the park,' 
You may believe its the truth which I 
utter, 
The best of all pleasures from daylight till dark, 
Was skating on one in the gutter. 
Skating on one, etc. 
To join in the sport I 
would loiter from school, 
And gain the great wrath of my master; 
Sometimes on the ice I 
would get a 
great fall, 
And go home for a 
piece of shin plaster. 
And oft through the day, I 
would steal soft away, 
With a 
hungry boy's balm, bread and butter, 
To meet my companions, so noisy and gay, 
And go skating on one in the gutter. 
Skating on one, etc.

Lend a 
hand to one another, 
In the daily toil of ; 
When we meet a 
weaker brother, 
Let us help him in the strife. 
There is none so rich, but may, 
In his turn, be forced to borrow, 
And the poor man's lot to- day, 
May become our own to-morrow. 
Lend a 
hand to one another, 
When malicious tongues have thrown 
Dark suspicions on your brother 
Be not prompt to cast a 
stone. 
There is none so good but may 
Run adrift in shame and sorrow, 
And the best of men to- day, 
May become the worst to-morrow. 
Lend a 
hand to one another 
In the race for honor's crown; 
Should it fall upon your brother 
Let not envy tear it down. 
Lend a 
hand to all, I 
say, 
In their sunshine and their sorrow, 
And the prize we've lost to-day 
May become our own to-morrow. 
MEN OF EDUCATION. 
Song and Dance by HARRY and JOHN KERNELL. 
DoN'T talk to us of your high-toned men ; 
With their fluent conversation, 
For with us boys none can compare, 
We are the greatest in the nation; 
We are known by all, both great and small, 
Two Irishmen from Donegal, 
And we'll have ye know, both one and all, 
We're men of education. 
CHORUS. 
We are Irishmen both heart and hand, 
We have just come here to this free land, 
And we'll have you all to understand 
We are men of education. 
Now the mayor of the town he is our best friend. 
And we drink with him every day; 
He is going to run us for Congressmen, 
And you bet we'll make it pay; 
Muldoon is envious of our fame, 
And Roger O'Malley has changed his name, 
And the ladies are wanting to know the names 
Of the men of education: 
We are Irishmen, etc.

Where the summer winds are murm'ring o'er the lea; 
You will think of me in kindness, as life's weary road you plod, 
When my spirit rests from pain man sorrow free. 
The sands of life are slowly ebbing, darling, with the tide, 
And soon these bones will mingle with the clay ; 
In the winter of your sorrow you will think of how I 
died, 
And you'll miss me, Chloe, when I'm laid away.

You will tell our little children that their father dwells above; 
How the angels led him up the golden stair, 
You will tell them how I 
lov'd them, with a

WE'VE just arrived in town to-night, 
Our story for to tell, 
We don't care much if we ain't white,

We're always welcome where we go,

And always wear a

When our plantation work is done,

Our hearts chock full of glee; 
Let politicians rave and blow, 
Let Horace Greeley spout, 
We care for neither friend nor foe, 
We're the happiest darkies out,

And thus we pass each night and day. 
Take dull care by the snout, 
And make him scoot some other way, 
From the happiest darkies out. 
Just watch, A

We go to a 
fancy colored ball, 
And dance a

We fascinate the wenches all, 
By the movement of the heel.

Working for the people's cause, 
Selected for our elegance 
To regulate the city laws.

EIORUS. 
We dress so neat it is a 
treat 
To see us marching hand in hand; 
Heads erect—you can't expect to see 
A 
sight again so grand; 
With a 
brand new shirt, free from dirt, 
We're the finest in the land, 
With a 
brand new dice we look so nice, 
We are Irish aldermen. 
Our influence is powerful 
Through the city and State; 
We can put you in the park 
To keep the flies out of the gate; 
Our wardrobe is fastidious, 
Cut out in the latest style, 
We captivate the ladies, and they always 
Greet us with a 
smile.

THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGG, 
A 
true illustration of life, written expressly for FRANK LEWIf 
by BOBBY NEWCOMB, America's Character Artist 
When I 
was of age my father he left 
To me quite a 
snug little sum; 
He says—" Now, my boy, good sense please employ, 
And remember you've reached twenty-one." 
My friends when they heard of what nad occurred, 
How they hastened to borrow or beg ; 
For 
dew a 
high kite, and they said, when in sight— 
" 
He's the goose with the golden egg." 
To my utmost surprise I 
attracted all eyes, 
And people inquired my name, 
Who a 
few months before, pronounced me a 
bore, 
And of my dress and my features made game. 
They'd laugh when I'd joke, with me dine, drink or smoke, 
To my face they were dumb as a 
keg; 
But when I'd turn my back, how they'd laugh and th( y' 
clack, 
At the goose with the golden egg. 
The girls all so fair, admired my hair, 
l'eLwas auburn—before it was red; 
They spoke of my style, drooped their eyes when I'd smile, 
And mamas marked me tit to be wed. 
Their daughters thGy sighed, and sonic their hair dyed, 
I 
was loved by Jane, Martha anti Meg; 
My presents they took, and they all tried to hook— 
The poor goose with the golden egg. 
But a 
day came at last, I'd been living too fast, 
Run in debt and my money all flown; 
Where'er I 
would call, they'd let me wait in the hall, 
And the message I'd get—" Not at home." 
They'd giggle arid jeer, where'er I 
appeared, 
Pass me by with a 
nod or a 
sneer; 
For the goose it was dead, and the egg turned to lead, 
I 
had bought my experience dear. 
Now my subject of rhyme may just be in time. 
For the world I 
don't care a 
peg ; 
But what I 
would say—I 
was once in my day, 
A poor goose with a 
golden egg.

And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah ! the cruel spoiler came—"

to misery and shame."

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tie old.. 
sat and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr-nged and printed in series—H.- arts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades— and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and K for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
towers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but tue directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we • 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Inclosed in handsome case

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means ot 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Idany young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diftl. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of C.Irds will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of q 
Lestions and answers. will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
u. adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
