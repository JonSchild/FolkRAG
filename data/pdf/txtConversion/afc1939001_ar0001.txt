XII 1939 * FROM THE REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT IN CHARGE, Mr. ALAN LOMAX
* From the Annual Report of the Librarian of Congress for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30,
1939, pp. 218–225.
Interest in the work of the Archive of American Folk-Song has grown steadily in recent
years as part of a developing consciousness of the significance of a native culture.
Recently, however, this interest has been intensified and the Archive has experienced a
correspondingly rapid growth both in the direction of acquisition of new material and in
demand for this material from a wide variety of sources.
Since last year's report was written, 1,103 field recordings and commercial records of
folk and pseudo folk-songs have been accessioned along with a considerable body of
field notes, photographs, moving-picture films, and other pertinent material. It can be
estimated that the Archive comprises over twenty thousand items of American folk-
music, representing most of the types of tunes to be found on this continent, and in some
cases, at least, defining important types. General use of acetate blanks, along with better
field equipment and field-recording techniques, has resulted in an improvement in the
acoustic characteristics of these field recordings until some records compare favorably
with commercial records made under ideal acoustic conditions. Not only has the Archive
grown in sheer size and in terms of improved recording technique, but the range of its
material has been greatly expanded. Sidney Robertson, Alan Lomax, John Lomax, and

Herbert Halpert have explored fields of foreign minority music with recordings of Finnish,
Serbian, Russian, Polish, Portuguese, Cuban, and Mexican songs and dances. There
has been a rapid development, too, of a feeling for the documentary record. In addition to
extensive field notes, movies, photographs, etc., every possible 64 opportunity has been
taken advantage of to record, along with the songs, what the singers, themselves, had to
say about them. In this way the songs are set in a context of the speech and opinion which
is their normal environment.
In later portions of this report a somewhat detailed statement of the Archive's collaborative
work with numerous individuals and institutions outside the Library will be set forth, but
it is important here to note how the Archive during the past year, has sponsored and
implemented five extremely fruitful recording projects carried on by other govenment
agencies. Recording equipment, materials, and criticism have, in a given instance, been
furnished a field worker from a governmental agency in return for which his field recordings
were deposited in the Archive. The agency then received a set of duplicates of the
records. This plan has been carried out successfully with the Farm Security Administration
of the Department of Agriculture, the Writers' Project, the Folk Arts Committee, the
Music Project and the Recreation Project of the WPA, with the cooperation of the Radio
Broadcasting Division of the Department of Interior, which has furnished both the labor and
the equipment for making the sets of duplicates. The same type of relationship has been
established with many local collectors, who have generously guided Archive recordists
to singers they had discovered. Finally, it must be added that commercial recording
companies, notably the Columbia Recording Company, have generously presented the
Archive with selected groups of records that had bearing on the Archive's field of interest.
It is to be expected that the future growth of the Archive will continue in the direction of
further such collaborative projects.
On the side of service, activity has been largely confined to response to inquiries
about folk-songs and to playing records for a great many visitors. Although a certain
number of duplicates have been made with the help of Mr. 65 Shannon Allen of the
Library of Congress
1939 Annual Report http://www.loc.gov/resource/afcss39.ar0001
Department of Interior, in response to requests from singers or folk- f lorists who furnished
material, a great many more requests for duplicate records have come in than could be
handled because of lack of equipment and of staff. Three notable exceptions can be
noted, however. The British Broadcasting Company requested help from the Librarian
of Congress in the preparation of three thirteen-week programs on American music
broadcast over its nation-wide government hook-up. John A. Lomax chose the records,
furnished the commentary, and songs or fragments of songs were dubbed off Library
originals for the records finally used on the programs. In the same way through the
National Broadcasting Company a set of dubbings was made for the French Broadcasting
Company to be used in a governmental program on discovering America, prepared by the
distinguished French radio commentator, M. Berger. Finally, the Columbia Broadcasting
Company has asked the Archive's collaboration in preparing and presenting a twenty-
four week program on American folk-music for The American School of the Air for 1939–
1940. This program is now in progress under the direction of the assistant in charge of
the Archive. Work in the field during the year is briefly summarized in the paragraphs that
follow:
Michigan, August to November 1938 — 249 Twelve-inch Acetate Records
A two and a half month reconnaissance survey of folk-music in Michigan brought into
the Archive a group of about a thousand songs, lumberjack, lake sailor, Irish, Southern
Negro, Finnish, Serbian, Polish, Canadian French, German, Hungarian, and Croatian. Dr.
Ivan Walton of the University of Michigan, Dr. E. C. Beck of the Michigan State Teachers
College, and Mr. Howard Newsome, Director of the Federal Writers' Project of Michigan,
were of assistance in locating singers.

After ten days spent in Detroit recording a few of the many types of foreign minority music
still orally current there, notably records of Serbian diple and douduc players, I visited
briefly a few of the fine lumberjack singers Dr. Beck had located near Mt. Pleasant. It

1939 Annual Report http://www.loc.gov/resource/afcss39.ar0001
was then arranged for me to join Dr. Walton, the authority on lake sailor songs, at Beaver
Island, Michigan. There he introduced me to two remarkable Irish singers, Dominick
Gallagher and Johnny Green. The latter, one of the most amazing ballad singers who
has turned up in America, recorded over a hundred come-all-ye ballads—forecastle,
lumberjack, lake sailor, Irish, popular, etc. Since that time he has written that he has
recalled a hundred and fifty more. The Beaver Island singers were all Irish and ended their
songs in the fashion described by Barrie as “parlando rubato.” Indeed, wherever a lake
sailor or lumberjack of fifty years or over was recorded this type of ending was noted.
A visit to Posen, Michigan, brought the Library an interesting collection of Polish ballads
and fiddle tunes. Many of the latter had been learned from local fiddlers when the Polish
settlers arrived and now among young people are passed under Polish names as Polish
tunes. Here, as all over Michigan, even including Detroit, a great revival of interest in old
dance forms was in evidence. Local bands were expected to be able to play national
music, jazz, and American square-dance music.
The Upper Peninsula of Michigan proved to be the most fertile source of material. After six
weeks of recording a mass of lumberjack, Finnish and French folk-songs, I felt that there
was material enough in the region for years of work. Near Newberry, Munising, Greenland,
and Ontonogan, it was comparatively easy to find lumberjack singers. Everywhere through
the Copper Country and south of it, Finnish singers generously furnished me with more
material than I had time to record. An d in Champion and Baraga I found French ballad
singers who still enjoyed ballad fests that lasted all night long.

New York City, December 25, 26, 1938—15 Twelve-Inch Acetate Records
With the help of John Hammond, organizer and mainspring of the New Masses swing
concert at Carnegie Hall, and the Allied Recording Company, who lent their machine for
two days, I was able to make for the Library recordings of five of the most remarkable
Library of Congress

Negroes in American music: Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, and Jimmie Johnson,
the “boogie woogie” pianists; Pete Jimmie Johnson, the blues pianist and composer; and
Saunders Terry, the blind harmonica player from North Carolina. These recordings were
documented in the fashion described above and represent the very finest performances of
these Negro folk-artists.
New York City, May, 1939—80 Twelve-Inch Acetate Records
Captain Dick Maitland, aged 82, of Sailor's Snug Harbor, in two days of singing filled
nineteen records with his version of the clipper ship shanties. Not only were his melodies
what Joanna Colcord calls “a generation older than most of those in print,” but Captain
Dick explained in his terse and seamanlike fashion just how each shantey was used
aboard ship.
Aunt Molly Jackson, formerly of Clay County, Kentucky, and a sort of walking encyclopedia
of the oral traditions of her people, recorded her singing biography for the Archive on some
sixty-one records. Story led to song and song to story. There are representatives of every
type of tune sung in the mountains—English ballads, feud ballads, banjo tunes, fiddle
tunes, sacred tunes, love songs, etc., with an exhaustive discussion of each type by Aunt
Molly, who can tell stories as well as she can sing.
California Folk-Music Project, San Francisco, California — 72 Twelve-Inch Acetate
Records
This project, which operates as a part of the WPA of California, under the 68 sponsorship
of the Library of Congress and the University of California has completed 160 recordings,
of which only a part have been copied for deposit in the Archive of California Folk-
Music, Photographs of singers and of folk musicians during performance have been
made, working drawings of the great variety of folk instruments found in California have
Library of Congress
1939 Annual Report http://www.loc.gov/resource/afcss39.ar0001
been completed, and a catalog of the material has been maintained. Sidney Robertson,
supervisor of the project, says in part:
Because almost no exploration of the field of traditional music has ever been undertaken in
California, it seemed advisable to define the intention of the project in the widest possible
sense. “California” folk music has therefore been understood to mean any traditional music
—song or dance tune—now current in California; a few items from other states which
dealt with California life or history have been included. The plan was to take a rapid cross-
section of traditional music among the minority groups as well as among the folk of Anglo-
Saxon antecedents, with the expectation that in relatively few instances would enough
material be recorded for research. However, miners' fiddle tunes and songs stemming
directly from the pioneers have turned up in far greater number than expected; in addition
three good ballad singers, one from Iowa, one from Wisconsin and one from Kansas,
the last two in California for more than thirty years, have added excellent material. The
Armenian folk songs from the mountainous region of Van, and the Gaelic songs from the
Hebrides are unique recordings. Much interesting Portuguese music from the Azores and
a certain amount of Spanish-California material are included.
To date 75 disks, about 250 titles, have been recorded by Americans whose native
language is English. It includes some music not strictly traditional such as Barbary Coast
ragtime, which is, however, necessary to any study of the oral tradition.
The music of various minority groups contains 85 disks and 360 titles so far. It includes
some Dalmatian instrumental music of great interest, a little Sicilian, Norwegian, Spanish
(from the Asturias), Costa Riquen? Negro and Mexican music. There are in addition
religious folk songs by Russian Molekani, and some Icelandic hymns and boat songs.
There are seventy titles in the Spanish-Californian group and eighty in the Portuguese.
Expedition of the Folk Arts Committee of the Works Progress Administration in the
Southern States, Spring, 1939— 419 Twelve-Inch Acetate Records
Library of Congress
1939 Annual Report http://www.loc.gov/resource/afcss39.ar0001
Mr. Herbert Halpert of the Federal project of New York City did a remarkable piece of field
work for his two co-sponsors—the Library of Congress and the Folk 69 Arts Committee
of the WPA—in his three months in the South. His itinerary, planned in collaboration
with the Music, Writers, and Recreation Projects of the WPA, carried him across a great
part of the region southeast of the Mississippi. The tunes recorded represent most of
the types of folk tunes current in the South-English and Scottish ballads, indigenous
ballads, dance tunes, white spirituals, Negro spirituals, work songs, blues, game songs,
creole songs from New Orleans, and Cuban songs from Florida. Much of the material
was thoroughly documented by workers on the Arts Projects and this documentation was
supplemented by Mr. Halpert's interesting questionnaire, the answers to which were in
great part recorded with the songs. Mr. Halpert visited the informants who had supplied
Mellinger Henry, Elihu Sutherland, Richard Chase, Professor A. P. Hudson, George Pullen
Jackson, and other folk-lorists with material, and recorded their valuable variant texts and
tunes. Throughout his trip the workers and supervisors of the Federal Writers' Project and
the Federal Music Project assisted him; in Wise County, Virginia, Emory Hamilton and
J. T. Adams; in Mississippi, Miss Eri Douglas, Miss Jerome Sage, Miss Sybl Macdonald,
Gene Holcomb, and Abbott Ferriss; in New Orleans, Mrs. Jeanne Wogan Arguedas; in
Jacksonville, Miss Zora Neale Hurston; on the Edisto Island, South Carolina, Chalmers
Murray. Mr. Halpert says in part:
The trip accomplished several things. There is first the solid fact of well over a thousand
items collected representing most sections of the South and a large number of the types of
material found there. Secondly, a useful service was performed by recording many of the
folk-song informants from whom texts without tunes had been published. In some cases,
too, private collectors with unpublished collections have had some of their songs recorded,
thus enabling more satisfactory publication should they achieve that state. Third, important
efforts of the Federal Arts Projects of the WPA towards the scholarly investigation of
American cultural materials is here concretely expressed. The success of the expedition
indicates how profitable this widespread activity on the part of the government agencies is.

JOHN A. LOMAX, THE SOUTH, FEBRUARY TO JUNE—142 DISKS
Musically and acoustically this is one of the best groups of records accessioned in the
Archive. The Honorary Consultant and Curator of the Archive, John A. Lomax, and Mrs.
Ruby Terrill Lomax made a criss-cross trip of 6,502 miles through the South, recording
Mexican and cowboy songs in south Texas, Negro section gang songs from Weirgate,
Texas, Negro gang songs in the penitentiaries, and road gangs of Texas, Arkansas,
Mississippi, Florida, and South Carolina, Negro spirituals, game songs and ballads in
Alabama and South Carolina, and white ballads, hymns and spirituals in Louisiana, Texas,
and South Carolina. “Much of the material was new to me,” writes Mr. Lomax, “though
in many instances we recorded variants of folk-songs which I had previously recorded
from other singers.” Many local people were helpful in locating material: Dr. Richard of the
State Teachers College in Kingsville, Texas; Sister Joan of Arc of Our Lady of the Lake
College in San Antonio; Herman Weaver, in Merryville, Louisiana; Rudy Pickens Tartt, in
Livingstone, Alabama; Genevieve Chandler, in Murrell's Inlet, South Carolina; and Ben
Robertson in Toccoa Falls, Georgia. Among the many singers who furnished fine material
Frank Goodwyn, Beale Taylor, Henry Truvillion, Doc Reed, Vera Hall, and Emma Floyd
certainly should be mentioned.
SPECIAL SKILLS DIVISION, FSA ADMINISTRATION—159 TWELVE-INCH ALUMINUM
DISKS
Under the supervision and guidance of Charles Seeger, at the time director of music in
the Special Skills Division of the Resettlement Division, numerous songs were recorded in
various parts of the country for use in the work of that agency. The recordings were made
during 1936 and 1937 by Sidney Robertson, Margaret Valliant, Lawrence Powell, Charles
Seeger, and others. They were duplicated, cataloged, and indexed by Mr. Seeger, and in
1939 the originals were 71 deposited permanently in the Archive, while a set of duplicates
was retained by the Special Skills Division of the Federal Arts Program for use in their field

service work. The material is extremely varied in scope-foreign minority songs from the
lake states, lumberjack songs, Negro spirituals, southern mountain hymns, banjo tunes,
ballads, fiddle tunes, etc.
Margaret Valliant has facilitated the acquisition of 20 twelve-inch acetate recordings she
made in the Southwest in the spring of 1939 for the Farm Security Administration. A
number of records have been made in the Archive from the singing of visitors who knew
interesting material: Blaine Stubblefield, Frank Melton, Ferdinand Morton and others. Over
a hundred duplicates have been made from time to time for special purposes, and in this
work Shannon Allen of the Department of Interior's Radio Broadcasting Division has been
most cooperative. The helpfulness of RCA Victor, Columbia Phonograph Company and
Decca Record Corporation has greatly facilitated the commencement of a bibliography
of commercially recorded folk-music. Special acknowledgment must also be made to
Jack Capps, R. P. Wetherald, John Hammond, Art Satherley, Frank Walker, and J. Mayo
Williams in this respect.
