G. H. MAODERMOTT'S "AWFULLY LOOSE" SONGSTER, 
BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 
M n. GEO. H. 
M ACDEEXOTT is of Irish extraction, and was born 
in London, Feb. 28, 1S15. 
He received a 
good collegiate educa-
tion, and, against his parents' wishes, adopted the sea as a 
profes-
sion, in which he remained several years. 
Becoming tired of the 
monotony of a 
sea-faring life, and having obtained great success in 
several amateur performances in his short stays on land, he at 
length determined to go on the stage permanently. He made his 
first professional appearance in Dover, England, as walking gen-
tleman, and made a 
very great failure through stage fright. 
The 
fact that the management had no person to take his place was the 
only reason he was not ignominiously discharged. 
His second ap-
pearance was in "Brand o' the Brae," in which he secured a 
great 
triumph. 
His popularity increased from this point, and being rec-
ommended to a 
London man-kger, he made his first appearance in 
the British metropolis at the Crecian Theatre, playing first heavy 
and burlesque. 
He discovered this to be his forte, and the follow-
ing year was employed to enact 
Blue Beard" at Covent Gaiden. 
Since this time his career was uniformly successful; and at the 
height of his popularity he Vas engaged by Mr. Samuel Colville 
as leading comedian for America of the Julia Mathews organiza-
tion. 
At the break up of this company he made a 
short starring 
tour to Philadelphia, Washington, and Baltimore, and was then 
engaged permanently by Mr. Josh Hart for the new E. {
.
•,•le Thea-
tre, New York. 
At this house Mr. M AZDEEMOTT'S ta!ents were 
justly appreciated, and he became a 
great favorite_ Among other 
roles in which he has successfully a*Ppeared is that of "Piermi 
Shell," in the exquisitely humorous burlesque of "Rosernt Shell," 
written by Mr. SYDNEY ROSENFELD.

THE TICKET ON THE SHAWL----[CozieLuarit.D1 
I 
bought the shawl without delay, 
Most girls, you know, like some display; 
That garment I 
so wished to don, 
So in the shop I 
put it on; 
Of course, I 
felt it no surprise 
To notice every body's eyes 
Attracted by my purchase, no, 
felt quite sure it would be so. 
Oh dear, cka. 
were startled, I 
declare, 
V.ten I 
beard a 
lad cry out, " Look there 
Why, I 
say, Bill, lor' bless ray eyes, 
Don't she know how to advertiser 
Then Bill replied, " Well, I 
must say, 
The lady does look rather gay, 
She really is a 
charmer, Ben, 
And precious cheap at two pounds ten." Oh dear, Axt. 
walked as far as Temple Bar, 
When a 
girl said, - Oh. miss, there you are; 
I 
must confi.ss you do look nice, 
But you shouldn't ticket up the price." 
A 
cabman cried out, " Miss, good luck, 
I 
likes a 
girl wot's got good pluck, 
I'll buy you for a 
wife, miss, when 
I 
saves as much as two pounds ten." 
Oh, dear. 4. 
I 
felt a 
kind of strange alarm, 
But a 
gent politely touched my arm, 
Saying, " Let me your attention call 
To this ticket pinned upon your shawl?" 
I 
nearly fell, but he caught my arm, 
And his soothing words had such a 
charm; 
We married, and I 
bless the hour when 
He met me marked up 
two pounds ten." 
And now I 
am a 
happy wife, 
Surrounded by the joys of life, 
I 
often tell of where and when 
Ile saw me marked up "two pounds ten.'

Copyright, l875, by G. H. ILICDERSIOTT. 
[I hereby teCT71 pubtishers against publishing this song, and sh2lt presese: 
any infringement on this copyright.] 
I'VE been dining and wining to- day, you can see 
In a 
style that's deucedly loose ; 
And to (To on the spree now I know wouldsua 
For I 
mustn't go home. 'tis no use. 
So I 
do feel so gay— so reckless and gay, 
My spirits so lively and spruce, 
That I 
fancy that I 
shall go on the Sy, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose. 
SPOKEN.—The fact is I've had a 
jolly good row with the 
Mis.sus, and I 
feel rather excited, not tight, you know, tint— 
I 
de feel so awfnlly loose—so loose! 
I 
do feel so awfully loose; 
I 
fancy that I shall go on the fly, 
For I 
do feel so awfully loose. 
I 
was walking and talking along Broadway, 
As I 
felt so uncommonly loose : 
While laughing and chaffing with every belle, 
The excitement must be my excuse. 
All at once I 
descried a 
girl by my side, 
My heart went pit- pat like the deuce ; 
I ,could nqt zee her face, but her style and her grace 
Soon made me feel awfully loose. 
SPOKEN.—There was something familiar about her, but she 
was closely veiled. 
My curiosity was aroused; I 
determined 
to know her, regardless of consequences, for— 
(I) 
7 
AVVI ULLY LOOSE.—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
I 
did feel so awfully loose—so loose! 
I 
did feel so awfully loose; 
I 
fancied that she would exactly suit me, 
For I 
did feel so awfully loose. 
To woo and to coo I 
embraced every chance, 
In a 
style that was dreadfully loose ; 
I 
pressed her to go to the Argyle to dance, 
And really would take no excuse. 
I 
vowed ' twould be bliss if she'd grant me a 
kiss, 
And to raise her veil tried to induce; 
" 
What is this !'' on my life! 
I'd been courting my wife.1 
Oh, I 
did feel so awfully loose! 
SPOKEN.— Yes, it was the Missus. She knew I 
was dining out; 
disguised herself, and had watched all my little goings on. She 
looked at me in her own peculiar way, and as she looked at 
me— 
CHORUS. 
I 
did feel so awfully loose—so loose! 
I 
did feel siPawfully loose; 
'Twas all up with me, I 
could easily see, 
Oh, I 
did feel so awfully loose! 
What 
e 
said and what / said, may be easily guessed, 
For we both felt remarkably loose; 
The dispute grew so warm that I 
thought ' twould be best 
To leave her, by way of a 
truce. 
So I 
left her behind, and comfort I 
find 
In imbibing the generous juice; 
I 
shall get it hot, but I 
don't care a 
jot, 
For to- night I 
am out on the loose. 
SPOKEN.—" Oh, wait till I 
get you home !" she said. 
So I 
think the best way to avoid a 
curtain lecture is to avoid going 
home; so I 
mean to make a 
night of it. 
For— 
I 
do feel so awfully loose, etc.

MY LOVE OF BYGONE YEARS. 
Words by F. LANGBRIDO E. 
Composed and sung by G. H. 
MACDERMOTT. 
I 
WANDERED in the gloaming, 
Beside the strearnlet's flow, 
And my thoughts kept fondly roaming 
To scenes of long ago; 
The forms my young life cherished 
I 
saw through happy tears, 
And her—long, long since perished— 
My love of bygone years. 
CHORUS . 
My first, lore, my last love, 
My only dear ! 
You came from the Past, love, 
To greet me here. 
You looked in my eyes, love, 
You kissed my brow— 
I'm tranquil and wise, love, 
And hopeful now. 
We parted in life's morning, 
In dreariness and pain, 
For there came a 
whispered warning, 
We might not meet again ; 
Yet I 
smoothed her golden tresses, 
And strove to calm her fears 
With words and fond caresses— 
My love of bygone years. 
My first love, etc. 
So the stately vessel bore me 
To regions strange and new, 
And full soon the grief fell o'er me— 
The warning came too true ; 
I 
was forced from life to sever 
The hope that life endears— 
She was lost to me forever, 
my l
ove of 
bygone years. 
My first love, etc. 
Yet to-niaht, when in the gloaming, 
Beiiie the streamlet's flow. 
My thoughts kept fondly roaming, 
To scenes of long :too; 
The forms my young life cherished, 
I 
saw through happy tears, 
And her—long, long since perished— 
My love of bygone years. 
My first love, etc,

M ACDEP.MOTT. 
THERE'S a 
language in the eyes which has 
For lovers wond'rons powers, 
And poets say there's language in 
The stars and in the flow'rs ; 
But there's another language too, 
Which all can understand ; 
And its words of friendship, trust, and love, 
Are told in the " grip of the hand!" 
Cli0Rus. 
Then give me a 
grip of your hand, my friend, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand; 
As one man to another, 
As a 
friend, and as a 
brother, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand. 
say to him who bravely works, 
Despising praise or blame; 
And strives by earnest, honest means 
To win his way to fame ; 
To patriots, and to statesmen too, 
Who work for their native land, 
And not for pension nor for place, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand. 
Then give me a 
grip, etc. 
I'd say to the poor and humble man, 
Who earns his daily bread, 
Who loves his home and strives to keep 
His wife and children fed, 
Who learns in self-denial's school, 
Temptation to withstand, 
And like a 
man his duty does, 
Give me a 
grip of your hand. 
Then give me a 
grip, etc. 
I'd say to every honest heart, 
To each good man and true; 
I'd say to every Yankee tar, 
To every life- boat's crew ; 
To the soldier— to the doctor, who 
By a 
poor man's bed will stand, 
Without reward, his pain to soothe, 
Give me a 
grip of your band! 
Then give me a 
grip, etc.

THE HAPPY FATHER OF THREE. 
A PATHETIC EPISODE. 
Words by F. 
LANGBEIDGE. 
Composed and sung by G. IL M ACDERMOTT. 
COME, hush-a- by, dearest of dears ! 
Ah! what's to become of poor me'? 
I've only been married two years, 
And this little chap's number three. 
If at such an astonishing rate 
Our family's always increased, 
It's clearly our terrible fate 
To have twenty-seven at least. 
CHORUS. 
Come, old fellow, mayhaps, if you'll swallow your pap, 
Your mind less excited may be ; 
And, my dear little chap, if you won't take a 
nap, 
Whatever's to happen to me 7 
lie's a 
fine little fellow, of course— 
Now, don't begin kicking, I 
beg— 
Such lungs, and as strong as a 
horse— 
There, that's pretty well for a 
leg. 
Beef, bread and potatoes are dear, 
But babies uncommonly cheap; 
The worst of this little one here 
Is somehow, he won't go to sleep. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Jane's snoring—just listen to that— 
While I 
shiver out in the cold ; 
I'll wake her, and give her the brat— 
But no! she might happen to scold.

Come, old fellow, ete... 
Come, hush-a-by, there's a

The clock's striking three, what a 
fix 
I'm getting uncommonly wild— 
They're going to call me at six! 
Of getting the ghost of a 
nap 
My chances appear rather blue; 
Mild measures have failed, so, old chap, 
I'll try what a 
slapping will do. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
stop howling—be quiet, you wretch 
The neighbors are sure to complain; 
'Shut up, or a

And now, ma'am„ I'm going to bed— 
Here take him, and sit on him, do!

Oh! he won't drink his pap, and he won't take a

And the clock's struck a

So long as you take him from me.

SPEAK UP, MY DARLINGS. 
Words by F. LANGBIZIDGE. 
Composed and sung by G. II. MAcpEamorr. 
My hair's get!ing thinner just here, girls, 
My figure tills rapidly out, 
And I've had this last winter, I 
fear, girls. 
The least little warning of gout; 
Now all these small matters combined, girls, 
Suggest a 
connubial life, 
And I've pretty well made up my mind, girls— 
I 
have, though—to take me a 
wife. 
CEIORES. 
here's an offer, 
An opening sublime—. 
Speak up, my darlings— 
But one at a 
time. 
My wife must be jolly and cosy, 
In figure compact and petite. 
With cheeks that are luscious and rosy, 
And trim little ankles and feet ; 
I'll have nobody languid and lazy, 
To loll with a 
novel, and yawn; 
"My wife must be fresh as a 
daisy, 
And up with the lark and the dawn. 
Girls, here's an offer, etc. 
She must know how to sew on a 
button, 
Be learned in puddings and pies. 
And when I 
grow tired of cold mutton, 
D:sh up in some cunning disguise ; 
And returning, perchance, from the city, 
My temper not specially nice: 
She must sing me some dear little ditty, 
And banish the blues in a 
trice. 
Girls, here's an offer, etc. 
There. darlings. I've touched very briefly, 
On matters with interest rife, 
•rl , things that will weigh with me chiefly 
In eiloosing a 
partner for. life; 
I'm sure there are plenty to fit me— 
You'll own my refinirements are small— 
And I 
wish that the law would permit me, 
SNeet darl:ng;, to marry you al.

SHE DECEIVED TIER JOHNNY. 
Words by H ABRY H UNTEM. 
Composed by -W ALTER REDMOND. 
Sung by G. II. MACIDERMOTT. 
I ONCE loved a 
maiden—yes, dearly loved her, 
And to this young maiden I 
made an offer; 
She said she would have me and be my dear wife, 
But I 
never was had so before in my life.„ 
CHORUS.. 
For she smiled, and she kissed me, and made a 
great fuss, 
And said, " My dear Johnny, there's none shall part us!" 
But when that conductor of her's came in view, 
She said, " Go to Putney, and I'll go to Kew!" 
No one in the world was so happy as us, 
'Till one day she took a 
ride on a 
Kew ' bus; 
And then the conductor she took for a 
beau, 
Oh! who would have thought she'd conduct herself so! 
When she smiled, etc. 
They married, but Bus.s.y got tired of his fair, 
And said, my in-cu-bus you are, I 
declare; 
So one day he took this unfortunate gal, 
And dropped her down into the Surrey Canal. 
Though she smiled, etc. 
Now, when Bussy had done 
he wished he had not, 
And fainted and swooned away on the spot; 
And all that was found next morning, alas! 
Were his books and his number, lyiag dead on the

"FOOLS AND THEIR 
MONEY'S SOON 
PARTED." 
Written and composed by G. W. ItuNT. 
Sung by G. 
II. 
MACDERMOTT. 
YOU'LL excuse my appearing in this shabby lot, 
But the garments I 
wear are the best I 
have got; 
They once were the fashion, as smart as e'er worn, 
21-otv fit for a 
scarecrow, all tattered and torn ; 
Just three years ago I 
came in for some cash, 
Like others before me—" went in " for " the dash !" 
I 
lived like a 
lord, the lot soon did spend, 
A short tho' a 
merry time— this is the end. 
CHORE'S. 
Ah! once I 
had cash, then I 
was rash— 
Cut such a 
dash—soon went to smash; 
:Now you may see I'm all up a 
tree, 
Yes, fools and their money's soon parted. 
I 
then used to toddle to ball- room or rout, 
If I 
now showed my nose they'd no doubt turn me out, 
And those I've befriended in sunshiny day, 
Now give me the cut, or pass over the way; 
This hat I 
have doffed to many a 
fair maid, 
Now the brim wouldn't stand it, of the roof I'm afraid, 
And these gloves, ahem ! Dent's best, once fit for a 
don, 
Now there's no kid about '
ern, I 
can scarce keep 'ent on. 
Yes, once I 
had, etc. 
I'd a 
gold- headed cane which I'd—aw—flourish about, 
But it's some time ago since that went—up the spout ; 
An eye-glass which an air of importance would lend, 
Long ago I—for safety left that with a 
friend! 
(1) .

FOOLS AND THEIR MONEY'S SOON 
PARTED."—Concluded. 
In a 
hansom I'd then travel thro' many a 
saeet, 
Now I 
tramp it not handsome about my poor feet ; 
These boots once such a 
fit, of the best patent leather, 
They scarce now can body and sole keep together. 
Alt, once I 
had, etc. 
This sleeve still for me possesses a 
charm, 
When I 
think of the darlings I've had on my arm 
Yes, this coat it could tell a 
good tale I 
believe, 
But one tail I 
find's given notice to leave; 
The wind thro' my Sydenhams often will steal, 
And nothing but holes in their pockets I 
feel ; 
They've clung to me well, so I'll still hold them dear, 
Tho' to- day I 
discovered a 
rent—in the rear! 
Ah, once I 
had, etc. 
And as for the garment I 
wear next my skin, 
To be severity with that, after years would be sin ; 
I 
could once " sport my linen " so spotlessly white, 
But now I 
am thinking it's best out of sight! 
So, boys, should some cash ever come in your way, 
&iek to it in case of the rainy day; 
Take care of yourself and don't be too free. 
Or some morning you'll find yourself right up a 
tree. 
CHORUS. 
When you have cash, never be rash, 
Don't cut a 
dash, or you'll go to smash; 
Then, just like me, you'll be all up a 
tree, 
If you and your money's once parted.

DON'T MARRY YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW 
Words by A. W. FRENCH. 
Music by H ARRY PERCY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
OF 
all the troublesome creatures 
That cling to a 
married man's life, 
There is none with such terrible features 
As the " Ma" of your own little wife. 
Her head is filled with suggestions 
For the good of connubial bliss, 
She'll kill you outright with her questions, 
Tetke my advice just in this, 
CHORUS. 
Don't marry your mother-in-law, 
Keep out of the reach of her paw, 
You had better be dead 
With a 
slab at your head, 
Than to marry your mother-in-law! 
Should your home e'er seem lonely and dreary, 
Your wife will then send for her sure, 
" 
It's so nice for Ma to come, Charley," 
Says your darling; you must it endure. 
And if your dear wife prove deficient 
In matters known to womankind, 
Her mother will post her in all things, 
And drive you well out of your mind. 
Don't marry, etc. 
She'll keep you all day in hot water, 
And worry you almost to death, 
Till you wish in your heart that her daughter 
And herself had never drawn breath ! 
She'll make your much hoped for Elysium 
A 
desert of unendinci, strife, 
So keep these few words in your vision, 
When you take to yourself a 
young wife. 
Don't marry, etc. 
SQUANDERING COIN. 
Sung by G. II. MACDERMOTT. 
I'm one of those fellows who's always all there, 
My maxim's to act if I 
can on the square; 
Of money I'm flush—pounds, shillings and pence 
I 
hurl to the winds, and don't care for expense; 
My horses, my hounds, and my clubs and my wine, 
And jewels for women both costly and fine 
To me are but nothing, and bank- notes but trash, 
To a 
swell whose main object is squandering cash. 
CHORUS. 
Squandering coin from morn till night, 
Squandering coin is my delight, boys; 
In spending your cash now with me join, 
My great amusement is squandering coin. 
At morning I 
rise and go out on the spree, 
For a 
lark never ceases with fellahs like me, 
And only when I 
am asleep in my bed 
That I 
really am quiet, can it truly be said; 
Whatever's expensive directly I 
try, 
At three shillings a 
dozen my oysters I 
buy ; 
On the races I 
bet, and don't care what I'm at, 
And you'll soon squander thousands on folly like that. 
Squandering coin, etc. 
I've tried speculation, drink naught but champagne 
At Baden my hundreds I've staked on the main ; 
I've run up accounts at both Hobby's and Poole's, 
And squandered alike among sharpers and fools. 
But still I'm so rich that whatever I 
spend, 
My fortune's not likely to come to an end; 
I 
never smoke cheaper than shilling cigars, 
And at music halls always stand treat for the stars. 
Squandering coin, etc. 
But stop—I 
have hit it— Eve thought of a 
way 
To get rid of my cash in a 
very quick way ; 
No matter how couch any man may possess, 
A 
wife will soon spend it in jewels and dress. 
So, boys, as I 
cannot get rid of my pelf, 
I'll marry, and then let my wife help herself; 
For what you don't give her she's sure to purloin, 
Get married—your spouse will soon squander the coin. 
Squandering coin, etc.

"Make up your mind what you're aoina to be ;

As 
venture to say, 
That you'll hit on the match of Policeman J. 
Who'd be a 
sailor, a- tossing at sea ? 
The penny- steamboats has sickened ; 
And her Majesty's ships, wherever they're bound, 
They stops for the purpose of running aground. 
Who'd be a 
soldier, a-standino- at ease 
To be pickled and ate by the Ashantees— 
Fed like a 
pauper, and worked like a 
horse 7 
Not if I 
knowed it—I

Look at me now, etc. 
Lazily lounging along the street, 
Setting the heart of the girls " on the beat ;" 
Grouped with the swells in the park or the row, 
Shunning all places and folks as is low ; 
Dazzling all eyes with my elegant looks, 
Loved by the housemaids, adored by the cooks; 
Welcomed to mutton and nabob sauce— 
These are the pleasures of life on the force. 
Look at tile now, etc. 
Whenever a 
terrible murder's done— 
A very mysterious piece of fun, 
I 
set to work without any ado, 
And of course succeed in getting a 
c'ue; 
This is my method of moving atona—

For Scotland Yard approves this course,

I

Where the gaslamps glare, and the damsels smile

Collars him tight, without remorse,

THE LITTLE CANTANKEROUS CAT. 
Written, composed and sung by G. H. M ACDERMOTT. 
OH, ladies and gentlemen, listen, I 
pray, 
To the history shocking I 
now will convey ; 
Some six months aao I 
made Susan my wife, 
And I've ever since lived in a 
whirlwind of strife. 
She'd a 
beautiful face, she'd a 
chignon so light, 
She'd a 
figure so trim, and her eyes were so briaht; 
I 
was struck with her air, but it soon appeared that 
I 
had wedded a 
little cantankerous cat. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, ' twas only tWs morning she knocked me down flat, 
And danced a 
breakdown on my best Sunday hat: 
Oh, beware, yon young men, when I 
tell you of that, 
And don't marry a 
little cantankerous cat. 
She's a 
sweet little creature to look at I 
know, 
But I've got a 
black eye from her last little blow; 
She can kick like a 
troop horse, can spar like Tom Sayers, 
And when in a 
rage, oh ! my eye, how she swears ; 
She has pulled my two ears till I'm quite in despair, 
My head is despoiled of the best of its hair ; 
While as to her scratching, I 
won't speak of that, 
For you know she's a 
little cantankerous cat. 
Yes, ' twas only, etc. 
People all envy me with my pretty young wife, 
Oh ! I 
wish they could have just three weeks of my life; 
She has broken six broomhandles over my back, 
No.. an hour do I 
pass without catching a 
crack; 
Well, I 
must put up with my lot I 
suppose, 
And it's some satisfaction to speak out my ;voes 
But I'd go to the gold coast if I 
thought that by that 
I 
could but say farewell, my cantankerous cat. 
Yes, ' twas only, etc.

[1 hereby warn publishers against publishing this song, and shall prosecute 
any infringement on this copyright.] 
I 
MAKE my bow to you, friends, how 
Do you do at the West'? 
Bright Wenus (Venus) she rose from the sea, 
But I 
rose out of yeast; 
My dad's a 
brewer known to fame, 
As Quassia, Swipes & Co., 
But I 
go by a 
grander name, 
And that's " the Bowery Beau." ( DrALoGuE.)* 
CHORES. 
The Bowery Beau—the Bowery Beau, 
I'm a 
beat and a 
beau from my top to my toe; 
Tho' raised in the Bowery, I'd have you all know, 
The Bowery's no place for the Bowery Beau. 
I've learnt to "pally vous Francais," 
I've also learnt to dance; 
And tho' my French is of the kind 
They do not speak in France, 
It's good enough, and " quantum stuff" 
For a 
cove who's got rhino; 
So Broadway belles, and Bowery swells, 
Receive the Bowery Beau. (DIALootrE.) 
The Bowery Beau, etc. 
Altho' my dad allows me but 
Five hundred dollars a 
year; 
I'm happy if I 
can but strut, 
And like a 
gent appear; 
I 
swear my dad's a 
millionaire, 
When ' mongst the swells I 
go, 
And gives myself a 
million airs, 
Not bad for the Bowery Beau. (DIALOGUE.)

LET the red- coated huntsman follow the hare 
With the hounds over hill and dale; 
Let the boatman row on the running stream, 
Or o'er it gracefully sail ; 
Let the sportsman go forth with his dog and gun, 
Or doze over rod and line— 
Give me a 
good dinner, good company too, 
And plenty of walnuts and wine. 
CHOKES. 
To youth there is bliss 
In a 
fair woman's kiss, 
And the pleasures of love are divine; 
But I'm an old sinner, 
And love a 
good dinner, 
With plenty of walnuts and wine. 
The pale- faced teetotler's envenomed abuse 
Is levelled ' gainst " Bacchus " in vain ; 
I've cheered up my heart with a 
bottle before, 
And hang it, I'll do it again, 
And the craven who loves not a 
full, brimming glass, 
Or emperor- like wouldn't dine, 
I'd feed on the husks of the kernel-robbed nut 
Till he wept for his walnuts and wine. 
To youth there is bliss, etc. 
What to me are the painters' arid poets' delights, 
The glories of battle and breeze ? 
Let other men fight for the glories of life, 
And leave me its pleasures and ease ; 
By plentiful presents of walnuts and grapes 
The woman I 
love became mine; 
Our furniture's walnut—our children are born 
— With birthmarks of walnuts and wine. 
To youth there is bliss, etc 
In sparkling bumpers of generous wine 
I'd drink to truth, beauty, and worth, 
For they and the vine and the walnut tree 
Are the treasures of old Mother Earth; 
And when I 
am laid in her bosom at last, 
I'll sleep ' nea,th the shade of a 
vine, 
Whose clustering tendrils shall gracefully spell 
My epitaph, " Walnuts and Wine." 
To youth there is bliss, etc.

AIR.—" 
The Cure." 
Good night; a 
stave I'll try to sing— 
Your call I 
can't refuse; 
I've come to see this little hall— 
My purpose to amuse. 
A 
bright girl I 
did love one time— 
Her name was Hattie Bean ; 
Quoth I, " Dear Hat, wilt be my wife 7" 
" 
Not much !" said she. 
SPOKEN.—" Reason?" said I. " Just ' cause," said she, 
" 
you're green !" 
CHORUS. 
I'm green! I'm green! 
Oh, ain't I 
awful green! 
" 
I'm green, am I ? 
And so I 
am! 
I've plenty of green-backs." 
This threw a 
new light on my case; 
She went in then for " whacks," 
A fry at Dorlan's—then we hied 
To her mansion, all serene. 
" 
Now, hat, once more—wilt be my wife ?" 
" 
Guess not," said she. 
SPOKEN.—" Reason 1" 
said I. " Just ' cause," said she, 
" 
you're green !" 
I'm green, etc. 
I 
took her to a 
dollar store, 
And made the greenbacks fly; 
My " fourteen dollar suit" I 
wore, 
(1) 
Her " pull-
back " caught each eye. 
I " squoze " a 
fair young damsel's hand, 
She cried, " What do you mean 7" 
" 
I 
love—" " Oh, git !" 
SPOKEN.—" Reason 3" 
said 
I. 
"Just ' cause," said she, 
" 
you're green I" 
I'm green, etc. 
I 
next went out upon a spree, 
Drinking " hot whisks" and " cobblers ;" 
My head grew light as any cork, 
My tongue ran like a 
g,,obbler's.. 
" 
See here, young sport, 1'11 run yer in: 
You're acting all- fired mean !" 
" 
Pull down your vest, and let me be !" 
" 
Ger long !" said he. 
SPOKEN.— " 
Reason?" said I. " Just ' cause," 
said he, 
" 
you're green !" 
I'm green, etc. 
Next morn I " brought up" at the " Tombs ;" 
The judge looked stern and cruel; 
" 
What is the charge ?" " Drunk as a 
fish !" 
" 
give him wholesome gruel! 
harder phiz I 
never saw— 
Ten dollars— thirty days !" 
" 
Hold on, old hoss! 
Say, what d'yer mean 1 
What for 1" said I. 
SPOKEN.—" Reason ?" said 
I. 
"Just ' cause," said he, 
" 
you're green !"

KALU-LU, 
THE MONARCH OF ASHANTEE. 
Words by EL rETITT. 
Composed by J. H. YouNo. 
Sung by G. II. MACDEIIIIUTT. 
M
ERE once was an Ashantee monarch whose name 
The greatest respect from his subjects would claim, 
Its mention an African tiger would tame, 
And the birds and the beasts would forget to die game 
The chameleon his color would change if he heard 
The sound of his voice when lie uttered a 
word; 
his subjects would fall on their trembling knees, 
Saying, cook us and eat us, or do as you please. 
CIIORUS. 
For this is the terrible historee, 
Of an ancient monarch of Ashantee ; 
A nioger who was fond of a 
stew, 
Was King Kalu-lu-lu, Ka 
Among African ladies a 
terrible rake, 
The wives he had married and eaten would make 
A respectable Mormonite shudder and quake, 
Or pickle his own in the great Salt Lake , 
But altho' he'd a 
relish for women and men, 
he'd a 
weakness for plump little children of ten ; 
The boys he called veal, and the girls he called lamb, 
And sometimes he cured them as bacon and ham. 
For this is, etc. 
Now, otle fatal day, a 
man who was white, 
Was eaten and found so dic.estive and light ; 
In flavor and quality really so nice, 
That he'd only eat white men whatever the price. 
He didn't much care for a 
Turk or a 
Greek, 
But a 
good fat Englishman lasted a \week; 
So he sent to his butcher, and ordered a 
few, 
To be sent to the kitchen of Ka 
For this is, etc. 
(I) 
KALU-LU, 
THE MONARCH OF ASHANTEE.— 
Concluded. 
Now, though ' twas a 
difficult thing to kidnap 
A sufficient supply, yet they managed to trap 
Enough missionaries from chapel and church, 
And geographers sent on the Livingstone search. 
And tho' the geographers proved rather tough, 
And required a 
good stewing, they captured enough, 
Including a 
Paddy, whom Ka 
Desired to be cooked as an Irish stew. 
For this is, etc. 
Now, when Paddy found out that he couldn't be saved, 
But was bound to be eaten, he ranted and raved, 
And swore he would trouble the dirty mud, 
Which Kalu-lu-lu presumed to call blood. 
That he'd get in his system, and bring down his fat, 
Till Kalu-lu-lu should be changed into Pat ; 
Thep he died, and the King when he sat down to dine, 
Pronounced him flavor remarkably fine. 
For this is, etc. 
Now the fatal effects of that Irish stew, 
Began to work out in King Kalu-lu-lu; 
For whether Pat's curse his system deranged, 
Or so many white men his whole body had changed, 
I 
cannot explain, but tho' black as the night, 
King Kalu-lu-lu now began to tern white: 
And so white, tho' his color he tried to get back, 
That a 
white man beside him would almost look black. 
For this is, etc. 
Now his subjects thought matters so strange, and so odd. 
That they killed him and ate him, and made him a 
god -; 
They *eared up an altar, took a 
few hundred lives, 
And made a 
great feast of his children and wives. 
Yet somehow the curse of that Irish stew 
Worked out in the eaters of Kalu-lu-lu : 
And each nigger descendant from 5 
1.:Ie 71p to prince, 
has been skew- bald or pie- bald, or white ever since. 
For this is, etc.

Tins world's ever turning, and life is a 
swing, 
Where we all get our ups and our downs, 
W e 
could laugh and be jolly, if Fortune would bring 
Many more of her smiles than her frowns. 
Yet I 
think, as all beings must live out their life, 
That. the best style of living is mine ; 
I 
can take my own share both of quiet and strife, 
And the kicks and the ha' pence combine. 
CHORUS. 
In private I'm only Bill Cooper, 
And fond of my billiards and beer; 
But at night on the stage I'm a " sooper," 
And call myself Percy de Vere. 
I 
seem but a 
seedy old codger, no doubt, 
As from tavern to tavern I 
roam ; 
But when Shakespeare may call on B. C. to come out, 
William Cooper is always at home. 
Though my hat may be shabby, my boots down at heel, 
And my garments suggestive of age, 
I 
am told my appearance is highly genteel, 
When I've put on my dress for the stage. 
In private, etc. 
In deep tnelo-dramas I'm frequently seen, 
Though I 
own that I 
never get heard ; 
Or with virtuous peasants I 
dance on the green, 
But I'm never permitted one word. 
In the pantomime opening I 
put on a 
mask, 
And I 
am always the first they knock down ; 
When the opening is ended I 
finish my task, 
And go on to be kicked by the clown. 
In private, etc. 
Yet soopers have cares like the rest of mankind, 
And our life has its tragical side ; 
When the curtain conies down and we're hidden behind, 
There's an end of our spangles and pride. 
We have wives to be fed, we have rents to be paid, 
And the little ones cling to their dad ; 
It is hard on myself and my likes, I'm afraid, 
In the winter when business is bad. 
(1) 
In private, etc. 
BILL COOPER THE " SOOPER."— Concluded. 
I'll keep up my spirits, whate'er may betide, 
And cry long live our national stage; 
And I'll say to myself with an accent of pride, 
I 
am one of the lights of the age. 
Folks may croak as they please, till they're black in the face, 
About art and the drama's decline ; 
But the stage cannot possibly come to disgrace 
W hile it boasts as much talent as mine. 
In private, etc. 
BOB HOPPER THE COPPER. 
Sung by G. H. MACDERMOTT. 
I'm a 
Bobby, I 
am, and I 
know my work, 
Aly duty I 
never, I 
never will shirk; 
I'm a 
good ' tin to run in, a 
good ' un to swear, 
At that game a 
Bobby's eternally there, 
And if you get copped by day or by night, 
this copper's the cove who can hold you tight. 
CHORUS. 
We do it up proper, 
We do it up proper, 
We do it up proper, we're always right; 
Bob Hopper the copper, 
Bob Hopper the copper, 
Bob Hopper the copper can hold you tight. 
A policeman's life is the life for me, 
True blue is the color we wear you see, 
And the reason we wear it, ' twixt me and you, 
Is because we can swear till all is blue; 
The small, small boys we put in a 
fright, 
We give ' em the blues when we hold ' em tight. 
We do it up proper, etc. 
A policeman's staff is the tool for me, 
We lay it about with such fiendish glee, 
For we Bobbies can always go on the strike, 
And hit where we please whenever we like, 
And whoever declares we are not in the right, 
We cop 'em at once and we hold ' ern tight. 
We do it up proper, etc. 
A policeman's grub is the food for me, 
And the price of a 
policeman's booze is free, 
And a 
peeler's love is a 
marvellous she 
As belongs to the area-stoker-a-cee, 
And when into supper we drop of a 
night, 
Whate'er we lay hands on we hold it tight. 
We do it up proper, etc.

MAJOR K .

PEPPER. 
Written and composed by G. W. M INT. 
Sung by G. n. MACDERMOTT. 
IF 
I 
seem somewhat excited, 
I—I 
trust I'll be excused, 
For myself and hospitality's 
Been outrageously abused; 
My Ancreline—my only child, 
One whom I've fondly hoped, 
has driven her father frantic, wild! 
For the hussy—she's eloped! 
SPOKEN.—Eloped! that's the word. 
Bolted, sir, bolted! " Guns 
and trumpets !" to think that my child should steal off—from her 
father's house ; but it's all that villain Jones—the villain's name 
is Jones, sir. 
You may have heard the poltroon's name before, 
but by the blood of the ancient Peppers—my name, sir, is K. 
N. Pepper, sir ! Major K. N. Pepper, and I 
can tell you, sir, 
I'm a 
reglar hot ' un—I say, by the sanguinary fluid of all the 
Peppers, I'll strangle that Jones if I 
catch him ! 
CHORUS. 
Oh, where's that Jones ? if I 
catch that Jones, 
I'm sure there will be slaughter ; 
Take all I've got—I 
don't care a 
jot, 
(plaintively) But don't take an old man's (laughter. 
Fool that I 
was, I 
let my child 
This coxcomb introduce, 
And from that fatal moment, yes, 
lie played the very deuce; 
lie had what foolish folks would call 
A 
fascinating manner—bah ! 
he'd sing " mamby-pamby " love- songs, while 
My child played the pianner, ugh ! 
• Srmax.—The designing humbug—oh, yes, he could sing— 
with his light tenor, as he called it—my girl said he could go 
up to K 
with it—I 
wish he'd gone down to the devil before I'd 
seen his baboon face, and there I'd sit with my cigar while they 
played and sang, till 1—perhaps dropped asleep. 
What they 
played then, Heaven knows ! I 
like an old fool thought there was 
no harm in it, but now— now I 
see the confounded idiot I 
was— 
me—me—K. N. Pepper, deceived—duped—fiddled! 
Oh ! 
Where is that Jones, etc.

MAJOR K . 
N . 
PEPPER.—Concluded. 
My girl got so affected, and 
So sad and queer her tones; 
That if I 
asked a 
question— 
She'd mix it up with " Jones ;" 
She had Jones for dinner, Jones for tea, 
'Till she lost her appetite ; 
But to leave her poor old dad for Jones 
Was—was—no—not exactly right. 
SPOREN.—You'll pardon me if I can't— quite—master my 
feelings, I'm sure ; but this is a 
terrible blow on a 
poor old 
lone man! ' twould have been bad had she ran off with a 
Fitz-
clarence, or a Fitznoodle, or a 
Norfolk Howard, but with a 
" 
Jones !" 
Oh, ye shades of the defunct Peppers, this is much 
too much! but— 
Where is that Jones, etc. 
(tenderly). But yesterday I 
waited 
To receive her morning kiss; 
She did not come as usual, 
Why, what could be amiss 7 
Before me laid a 
letter 
Which chilled me to the bones; 
" 
She hoped I 
would forgive her, for 
She'd run away with Jones !" 
SPOKEN.— Guns and trumpets! here am I 
defeated! 
I—who 
have often led my men on to a 
glorious victory—my child cap-
tured under my very nose. 
Forgive her! 
Sever—never— 
never! she prefers Jones to her poor old doting father. 
She 
may want bread first—she may starve—and yet, when I 
think of 
how I've loved her—how to hear her voice was to me the sweet-
est music, and her pretty face the brightest vision that could 
haunt one's house—how—she—she's played at—at horses with 
the tails of my coat, and—and— whipped my poor—old— legs 
with the toasting fork, and told me to " Gee hupp,"—and how 
she grew into a fine, true English girl—the image of her 
dear mother—and how she would nurse her old dad when the 
gout set in— so tenderly. 
But that's all torn from me ! 
She's 
stolen from me by a—a—puppy! a—a— monkey! a—a—what 
I 
call—an idiotic of- shooter— if I 
only meet that juvenile ba-
boon, damme, I'll dislocate his confounded neck for him ! 0—curse

THERE are beauties in France, there are beauties in Spain, 
Beauties in England as well ; 
But of all the beauties I 
ever beheld, 
My pretty Kathleen is the belle; 
She is not a 
princess, she is not a 
queen, 
Or " star of most brilliant array !" 
She's only a 
maiden who works all day long 
At a 
milliner's store in Broadway.

And wander where I 
will, 
I 
still am ever sure to stray 
To that fair maid who plies her trade 
At a 
milliner's store in Broadway. 
One Monday, you know, I 
thought that I'd go 
To Hoboken just for the day ; 
I'll never forget, ' twas there we first met, 
She looked so delighted, so gay; 
Whilst playing at " kiss in the ring," on the grass, 
Her handkerchief at me she threw; 
She ran, then I 
caught her, I 
brought her safe back 
And kissed her—yaw—yaw—wouldn't you 1 
And wander, etc. 
We chatted, we talked, we quietly walked, 
All Nature's bright beauties to see ; 
With hearty good will we climbed Castle mu, 
And indulged in a 
ninepenny tea; 
'Twas over this meal the maid did reveal 
Her sweet occupation in life ; 
How I 
prayed that this queen would forsake "the machine," 
And come to my heart as my wife. 
And wander, etc. 
From that very day, I'm delighted to say, 
We lov'd and we coo'd like two doves, 
'Till one lovely night, when the stars shone bright, 
We told one another our loves; 
Her parents, she said, agreed we should wed,

A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS—POMPEY and LISA JANE. 
[Scene, full stage garden. 
Set cottage R. H. Od E. A small 
box or barrel on stage to sit on. 
Enter POMPEY to introductory 
music. 
Sits on barrel or box, and lights a 
small pipe.] 
POMPEY.—Just come down to see the apple of my eye, that 
dear, sweet, bewitching little yellow gal, Lisa Jane! 
Talk 
about your Venuses and such trash! 
You ought to see her. 
Why, she's so sweet, that she can't go out in the fields with-
out a 
veil, for fear of the bees lighting on her, she looks so 
much like a 
walking rose. 
Then she says I'm her darling. 
Hi! I 
feel like a 
sunfish just caught. I 
can't keep still. 
I 
think I 
must be in love. 
That's her cottage, where she lives 
with her ma and pa. I 
wonder if she's home. 
Oh, my I 
how 
I 
would like to see her; yet my heart beats as if I 
had a 
loco-
motive and train of cars inside my shirt-front. 
[LISA JANE sings inside cottage.] 
Am—" Old Kentucky Home." 
The sun shines bright in my old Kentucky home, 
'Tis summer, the darkies are gay; 
The corn-top 's 
ripe, and the meadows are in bloom, 
And the birds make sweet music all the day. 
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor, 
All merry, all happy and bright; 
Bimeby hard times comes a-knocking at the door, 
Then my old Kentucky home " good night!" 
[FomPEy listens attentively. 
LISA JANE, at the end of the 
1st verse, backs out of the cottage. POMPEY joins in the chorus, 
without being discovered by LISA JANE until the end.] 
CHORUS. 
Weep no more, my lady, weep no more to-day, 
For we'll sing one song for my old Kentucky home 
For my old Kentucky home far away.

wrong of you 
[Biting her apron corner.] 
POMPET.—Fact! that's what I 
came down here for. 
Took 
the gravel train early this morning and walked. 
LISA JANE.—Oh, stop your fooling now. 
POMPEY.—Tell me, now, you don't like any other fellow, do 
you? 
LISA JANE.-0h, go 'long! 
POMTET.—Do 
you care for fat Jake? 
LISA JANE. — Now who's been telling you 'bout him? 
POMPEY.— There! I 
knew you didn't care for him. 
Or slim 
Jim ? 
LISA JANE.— Oh, behave! how you like to tease I 
POMPEY.— I 
thought I 
was the only one. 
You don't know 
how happy you make me, when you talk like that. 
[The first strain of galop is played very softly. 
LISA JANE 
and POMPEY strike positions, and stand perfectly still and lis-
ten. 
At second strain, played very loudly, a 
burlesque around 
the stage, both going in opposite directions, until the song begins. 
At second strain of the sang they work to the back of the stage; 
and at third strain of the song they schotti.sh down to the front 
again.

" THAT LADY SEEMS TO KNOW YOU, 
GEORGE ." 
Words by SAMUEL N. 3.IrrciTELL. 
Music by J. TANNRICBAITM, 
The Music 
of this song is published by wnrrz, Ssrrrn & Co., 293 axe 300 
Washington St., Boston, Mass. 
Price 40 cents. 
THE band was playing in the park 
One August evening fine, 
And crowds of promenaders gay 
Were marching by in line ; 
The fellows in full force were there, 
The girls were plenty, too, 
And with flirtations, chats, and such, 
All had enough to do. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
was harnessed to my love, 
Who now and then would say, 
Cl That lady seems to know you, George, 
Who is she, tell me, pray 7" 
The ladies, bless the gentle doves, 
All seemed to bow to me, 
Which, with Louisa by my side, 
Did not at all agree ; 
And one, believe it, nudged me hard, 
I 
did not know her name, 
Or even the direction which 
The little damsel came. 
But I 
was, etc. 
I 
told my love that it was rude, 
For we'd ne'er met before, 
And then I 
said, " I'm sure she's not 
The style that I 
adore." 
Besides, I 
thought her impudent 
For doing such a 
thing, 
And then the band struck up the air 
My darling loved to sing. 
But I 
was, etc. 
I 
scarce had got the sentence out 
When, lo, behold I 
there stood 
A 
maiden throwing kisses just 
As fast as e'er she could ; 
She aimed them all at me I 
knew, 
For in her roguish eye 
I 
saw ' twas her intention then 
To toss them on the sly, 
(1) 
But I 
was, etc. 
41 
" THAT LADY SEEMS TO K N OW YOU,' 
GEORGE ?"—Concluded. 
Apologize again I 
must 
To my Louisa fair, 
Lest she should think that I 
for her 
Did not the slightest care; 
I 
told her jokingly I 
thought 
The kisses flew too high 
For me or any other chap 
To catch them on the fly. 
But I 
was, etc. 
This rather vexed the little one, 
She wanted to go home, 
She was " so tired and sleepy that 
She could no further roam ;" 
But ' ere we reached her domicile, 
A 
girl bewitching sweet, 
Said, as she passed aside us, " George, 
Next Sunday night we meet." 
But I 
was, etc. 
GERTIE, MY DARLING, W ELY DID YOU DIE ? 
Words by SAMUEL N . 
M ITCHELL. 
Music by J. TANNENBAUM. 
The Music of this song is published by CORY Bnos., 120 Westminster St., 
Providence, It. I. 
Price 35 cents. 
THEY have laid her to rest ' neath the willow, 
By the side of her mother and child; 
In summer birds sing sweetly o'er her, 
In winter the winds whistle wild ; 
Her form was as fair as the fairest, 
Her eyes were as blue as the sky, 
Oh, Gertie, my darling, my loved one, 
Why did you, why did you die ? 
CHORUS. 
Her form was as fair as the fairest, 
Her eyes were as blue as the sky, 
Oh, Gertie, my darling, my loved one, 
Why did you, why did you die ? 
Her lily white hands they were folded, 
A 
rose- red was placed on her breast, 
her coffin was strewn with camelias 
The day that they laid her to rest; 
Her sweet, gentle voice, how we miss it, 
And also her kind loving smile, 
Oh, Gertie, forever you've left us, 
Oh, why was it not for a 
while 7 
Her form, etc.

TIME ALONE WILL PROVE.—ICoscLuDrs.1 
That marriage is a 
lottery 
You'll own beyond a 
doubt; 
And woman is that sort of thing 
No fellow can make out; 
The men who choose a 
wife in hatta 
Too often find they're sold; 
But when they get a 
good one, they 
Have found a 
mine of gold. 
CHG.—Time alone will prove, IL 
Too often we believe in those 
Who make the finest show, 
And take their glitter all for gold 
Before their worth we know; 
The gilt wears off, we find them out, 
And somehow they suggest 
The olden shows at country fairs, 
The outside is the best. 
Cao.—Time alone will prove, kte. 
New schemes are starting every day 
There's something new appears, 
Long legal eases, too, that seem 
As though they'd last for years; 
How all these things may chance to fed 
The wisest do not know. 
So be content to wait and see 
What time alone can sb--Av 
Cso.—Tirne alone will Fove, Ava. 
The Tichhorne case. now 701;12 ca., 
Creates a 
stir and fuss, 
It bothers all the legal minds 
And sadly ptrzzles us. 
Is he the man! well, if he's not, 
His is a 
clever move; 
lirow would you be Parpristd 
to hear ) 
But time alone w ill prove. 
Cno.—Time alone will prove, dm 
; 
41 
TOIL ! 
TOIL ! 
HURRAH for honest labor, 
Hurrah for honest pleasure, 
Hurrah for honest men where'er they be, 
For riches do not crave now, 
And each day a 
little save now, 
And toil from morn till night, boys, cheerily. 
CHORUS. 
Toil, toil, toil until you prosper, 
But never stop to loiter on the way ; 
Though the past we can't recall. 
There's a 
future for us all 
Depending on the labors of the day. 
Now when I 
say be saving, 
I 
do not mean be craving, 
For craving ofttimes leads into strife; 
To obtain wealth you must seek it, 
And when you've found it keep it, 
But don't deny yourself the means of life. 
Toil, toil, etc. 
If you have ups and downs, boys, 
Your melancholy drown, boys, 
For hard and honest labor have you still 
Then by hard and hearty striving, 
Once more you'll be arriving 
Upon the lofty summit of the hill. 
Toil, toil, etc. 
45 
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE BOUND TO BE 
RIGHT. 
THERE are thousands of people who think they're so smart, 
That are far too clever by hal f, 
Who oftentimes think they are performing on us, 
When against them we all turn the laugh; 
They are too wide awake, and you'll make a 
mistake, 
If you let them get out of your sight. 
Don't let them have you, but try to have them, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
CHORUS. 
So always endeavor to be wide awake, 
And trust no one out of your sight, 
Take care of your health, take care of your wealth, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
Advertisements show in the papers each day, 
That a 
firm has got money to lend, 
A 
hundred or so on your own note of hand, 
If you're hard up to them never send ; 
For it's only a 
swindle got up by some rogue, 
Who gets all he can, then takes to flight. 
So from them keep apart, you can do the laugh, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
So always endeavor to be wide awake, etc. 
Now if you get tired of a 
bachelor's life, 
I 
hope now, young men, you'il take care, 
For to mate this arrangement with your better half, 
To your home no relations are there ; 
For you'll find that your mother-in-law will want to be 
At your house from morning till night. 
When such is the case, close the door in her face, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
So always endeavor to be wide awake, etc.

THE STAGE STRUCK IRISHICAX. 
Am," What Can the Matter Be." 
Stage struck whin a 
boy, I 
wint to school gaily, 
Didn't care for the birch, tho' I 
tasted it daily, 
At school-time I 
ranted and whirled my shillelahb 
And I 
always was playing the fool. 
SrosEN—Says my master: 
Oh dear, what will become of him, 
Dear, dear, what will become of him, 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
He's quite a 
disgrace to my school. 
SPOREN.—One day my master called my name out, " Dicky. 
my boy," said he, " howld up your head, and let me hear you re-
pate that piece I 
towled you to learn." " Yis, yis," said I, but 
the fact was I 
seldom paid any attention to what he said, so I 
just gave him what came first, and I 
bawled out lustily, " My 
name is Norval, on the Gramphian Hills, my father feeds his 
flock, he was a 
man, take him for all in all, what said the fool of 
Beggar's offspring is this a 
dagger I 
see before me. 
Give me 
another horse, bind up my:wounds, I 
do remember an apothecary, 
but no more lek my father, than I 
to Hercules. 
O, my pro-
phetic soul, my uncle, of all men else have I 
avoided thee, to be, 
or not to be, that is the question. 
l'm weary of couje,Jures, this 
must end. 
St NG—I 
shall, quoth my master, with rage his les" 
This is no place to give me sauce in 
Instead of a 
horse, I'll give you a 
horsing, 
So he bound me quite fast to a 
stool. 
47 
THE STAGE-STRUCK IRISHMAN.—(CoNcLroza).) 
SPOKEN—Says /IC at every stroke— 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
Dear, dear, what will become of him, 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
He's quite a 
disgrace to my school. 
SPOKEN.—After he had flogged me until he was tired. "Young 
man," says he, " as there is not a 
bit more of the birch left, I 
shall not flog you any more at present." " Thank ye, sir," sez I, 
" 
then as I 
may not have another chance again, I'll just take the 
liberty of telling you a 
bit of my mind," so I 
seized my shillelah, 
mounted a 
form, and held forth thus: " Most potent, grave and 
reverend seignior, my very noble and approved good master, that 
you have wronged me, doth appear in this, you have disgraced 
me by a 
vile blow, had not a 
dagger done a 
nobler service. 
I've 
been your faithful slave too long. I 
have set my life upon a 
cast, 
and I 
will stand the chazard of the die. Richard's himself again. 
I 
go 
lie who moves one step to follow me dies upon the spot." 
SUNG—This said, I 
marched out with the air of a 
Rolla, 
The master jumped up and determined to follow, 
But I 
got the start, and I 
beat him quite hollow, 
And I 
left the old fellow to cool. 
SroKEN—And as I 
marched off I 
heard him saying: 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
Dear, dear, what will become of him, 
Oh, dear, what will become of him, 
He's quite a 
disgrace to ray school.

shave my father every day, 
He makes me lather him, 
Because he says that is the way, 
To keep my hand in trim; 
The lumps and bumps upon his face,

Or leave a

Sometimes a

Comes in to get a 
shave, 
And then says dad, -Look sharp, my lad,

As white as a

As plain as a

As tight as a

As heavy as lead; as light as a

As steady as time; uncertain as weather.

SHE WOULD, 
YOU KNOW ; SHE WAS JUST 
ABOUT THE AGE. 
On! once I 
dearly loved a 
girl, her name was Sarah Greene, 
No rarer girl, no fairer girl, than Sarah shall be seen. 
Seventeen years old, need you be told, for a 
sweetheart she'd a 
rage, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she's just about the 
age. 
CHORUS. 
But then, of course, she would, you know, 
She would, you know she would, 
But then, of course, she would, you know, 
She's just about the age. 
She lived a 
little way from town, it wasn't very far, 
And with her lived a 
cross old chap, altho' he was her pa. 
One day when her papa was out, I 
went to ber's to dine, 
And in my pocket, for a 
treat, I 
took a 
glass of wine. 
For she liked wine, she would, you know, etc. 
We sat and talked a 
little while, and after we had dined, 
I 
for a 
little drop of wine felt mightily inclined
; 
When her father he knocked at the door, and she to me did 
rush, 
And pushed me in the cupboard, and oh! I 
saw her blush! 
But then, of course, she would, etc. 
Her father sat and talked to her for half an hour or more, 
And she sat leaning all the while against the cupboard door, 
When the wine flask in my pocket broke and made a precious 
mess, 
Ran under the cupboard door and round her new silk dress, 
For she wore silk, she would, etc. 
Her father saw the flowing wine, and said, " Sarah, what is 
that ?" 
She said, " Some jam and pickle jars are broken by the cat." 
He opened then the cupboard door, saying much like damn, 
And I 
was in a 
pickle, as well as in a 
jam. 
And the old man swore, he would, etc. 
He pulled me out and punched my head, then with 
ood humor 
he 
On hearing I 
was not bad off', invited me to tea. 
Since then I've married Sarah Green, and yearly to 
My Sarah will present me with a 
little girl or boy. 
But then, of course, she would, etc. 
my joy,

SIX MAGNIFICENT BRICKS. 
As sung by JOUNICY ROACH. 
MYSELF and my friends once, thinking there'd be no harm, 
Went for a 
walk down town, arm-in- arm, 
The night it was dark, the street it was very calm, 
When we went out for a 
spree. 
Said Jones, now do what I 
tell you, boys, hurrah, hurrah, 
Louder still, for that ain't half a 
noise, hurrah, hurrah. 
Now we'll strike up the bagpipes all the way and let tine people 
see, 
That we six magnificent bricks have made up our minds' forAt. 
spree. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, ah, au, fole da doodle dum, 
ah, ah, fole da doodle dum, 
ah, ah, foie da doodle dum, 
Fole da doodle dum da. 
Through Broadway, up Grand street, and down the same, 
Just like jolly cocks sure enough on we came; 
A lot more fellows all joined in our little game, 
As we went out for a 
spree. 
here we stopped for a 
minute to bawl, hurrah, hurrah, 
The others replied at once to the call, hurrah, hurrah ; 
Then we struck up the bagpipes once again to let the people see, 
That we six magnificent bricks had made up our minds for a 
spree. 
Ah, ah, ah, etc. 
Going along we went down a 
narrow street, 
A party of coppers out marching we did chance to meet ; 
They took us to the station house just by the way of a 
treat, 
To heighten the joy of our spree. 
But we were determined to keep up our pluck, hurrah, hurrah, 
So we gave another by way of good luck, hurrah, hurrah ! 
Then we struck up our bagpipes in our cell, to let the coppers 
See, 
That we six magnificent bricks had made up our minds for a 
spree. 
Ah, ah, ah, etc. 
The other chaps locked in the station began to shout, 
Inspector he couldn't make out what the row was about; 
He ordered the coppers again to turn us out, 
And not come in there for a 
spree. 
We wet e 
shoved out of the station house door, hurrah, hurrah, 
So just for joy we gave one cheer more, hurrah, hurrah; 
So home we went with the bagpipes to let the people see, 
That we six magnificent bricks had made up our minds for a 
spree. 
Ah, ah, all, etc.

THE SHA.UGHRAUIT. 
Words by GEO. CoopER, 
AIR.—" Pat Molloy." 
THERE was a 
brave young Irish lad, the pride of all the land, 
For dancing and for rattling sport the chief of all the band; 
The girls they smiled upon him, too, and sighed when he pass.. 
ed by, 
And shyly glanced upon him from the corner of their eye! 
Unto his master, leal, and true he never swerved an inch, 
A 
noble friend he proved to be at each unlucky pinch; 
He followed him beyond the sea when tyrar y 
was rife, 
This darling boy would save him, and would shield him with 
his life! 
CHORUS. 
Am.—Chorus of " Regular 
Then it's hip hurrah for Irish lads and 
Their hearts are kind—you'll alwa 
true! 
For their native land they'll brave

They charm the girls, and boldly deal destruction to the foe.

When the Shaughraun's master came 
To green Erin's land of fame, 
From the perils of prison so (hear, 
The priest so good and kind 
Sheltered him where none could find, 
And this noble Irish lad was ever near. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
But when prison walls so cold 
Did his master's form enfold, 
To the rescue so nobly he sped; 
No bolts and bars can bind 
Those who fight for home, you'll find, 
And the hirelings found an empty cage instead. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
Ara.—" Killarney." 
Lore had won the Shaughraun's heart, 
Pierced it with a 
fatal dart ! 
From his girl he ne'er could part 
Till the life within had flown; 
Her's the smile that shone afar 
Like the lovely morning star,

Ant.—" Tim Finnegan's Wake." 
But when they all thought the Shaughraun dead, 
A 
handsome " waking " they gave to him, 
And they laid him upon a 
feather bed; 
There was Mickey and Pat and Ted and Tim! 
And the whiskey it flowed in the sweetest way,

That Conn was a

BIG RUBBER BUSTLE. 
Banjo Solo by ED. HARRIG.421. 
I'LL sing of my girl, my lovely girl, 
She could play seven up and rounce, 
One fault she had, she had eyes like a 
shad, \ 
She couldn't set still but she'd bounce. 
I 
shall never forget the first time we met, 
With a 
wash-tub she was having a 
tussle, 
She fell on the ground and bounced out of town; 
The gal with the big rubber bustle. 
I 
searched far and near till I 
found out my dear, 
She was stuck on the end of a 
steeple, 
High in the air she was hung by the hair, 
Making snouts down at the people. 
A rope I 
soon found, fetched her to the ground, 
It used up a 
great deal of muscle ; 
To the preacher we sped, I 
was bound to wed, 
The gal wid the injun rubber bustle. 
When we got to the place she was red in the face, 
The preacher ses now den I'll tie her ; 
On her bustle she dropped, frou,Th de skylight she popped 
Like a 
base ball de boys call a 
flyer. 
She lit on a 
cloud and went out of sight, 
To get into heaven she'll tussle, 
She made a 
mile at a 
jump, at every thump 
She got on dat big rubber bustle.

finest., moat poetical. MOSt ardent apostrophes to Home, Liberty, Luton, in-
dependence, will be found in this book. 
While specimens are given of the patriotic 
epics of other lantht, our selections are mainly taken from the lyrics of our own great 
poets—poets who have poured out their burning phrases like molten lava streatna, 
filling every American youth's heart witu the idea 
" 
That the rude whirl Wi nil and the torrent's roar 
But bind W M to his nati,e hills the more."

This book I 
Itroislies a 
much needed collection 01 the most justly popular pieces

for oratorical practice and display in Private as well as Public Schools, Academies 
and other institutions of education.

This most amusing book hod udes in its pages a 
great number of the best humorous 
pieces in the language. They are of all shades of fun, Iron, the most delicate play-
fulness to the roost broadly farcical, but all full of the very spirit of harmless jollity. 
While some of the pieces are those old stsudard recitations that never tire or stale by 
repetition, many ° Olds are full of the new and fresh , and original humor of the tilneC.
