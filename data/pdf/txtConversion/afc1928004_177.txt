THE FADED COAT OF BLUE. 
By J. H. ArNAUGHTON. 
The music of this song is published by IL S. MACKIE, 82 State Street, 
Rochester. 
Price 35 Cents. 
My brave lad he sleeps in his faded coat of blue, 
In a 
lonely grave unknown lies the heart that beat so true, 
lie sank faint and hungry among the famish'd brave, 
And they laid him sad and lonely within his nameless grave. 
CHORUS, 
rTo more the bugle calls the weary one, 
Rest, noble spirit! in thy grave unknown ! 
I'll find you, and know you, among the good and true, 
When a 
robe of white is giv'n for the faded coat of blue. 
He cried—" Give me water and just a 
little crumb, 
And my mother she will bless you through all the years to come ; 
Oh ! tell my sweet sister, so gentle, good and true, 
That I'll meet her up in heaven, in my faded coat of blue." 
No more the bugle calls, & c. 
lie said—" My dear comrades, von cannot take me home, 
But you'll m irk my grave for mother, she'll find me if she'll come, 
I 
fear she'll not know me, among the good and true, 
When I 
meet her up in beav'n in my faded coat of blue." 
No more the bugle calls, & c. 
Long, long years have vanished, and though he comes no more, 
Yet my heart will startling beat with each footfall at my door, 
I 
gaze o'er the hill where he waved a 
last adieu, 
But no gallant lad I 
see, in his faded coat of blue. 
No more the bugle calls, &Lc. 
No sweet voice was there, breathing soft a 
mother's prayer, 
But there's One who takes the brave and the true in tender care. 
No stone marks the sod o'er my lad so brave and true, 
In his lonely grave he sleeps, in his faded coat of blue. 
No more the bugle calls the weary one, 
Rest. noble spirit! in thy grave rinknown. 
I'll find you, and know you, among the good and true, 
When a 
robe of white is giv'n for the faded coat of blue.

I WAS SIGHING IN MY SLEEP. 
Written and Composed by H. MAcCAtertiv. 
The Music of this song is Published by White, Smith & Perry, 298, 
300 Washington Street, Boston. 
Price 40 Cents. 
I 
was sighing in my sleep, love, 
When a 
bright pearly tear, 
Came a 
trickling down my cheek, love, 
For my dream was very drear; 
I 
dreampt thou'd learned to doubt me, 
I 
felt thine eyes were cold; 
For they shed no joy about me, 
As 
in loved days of old. 
CHORUS. 
May the adage then hold true, dear, 
That reverses all our dreams; 
And the darkest clouds of night, dear, 
At morn be love's bright beams. 
I 
was sighing in any sleep, love 
And dreampt the love had flown, 
That in our bright youthful days, love, 
Had made thee all my own ; 
Then I 
tried to find the light, love, 
That was even in those eyes, 
But tears had dinim'd the sight, love, 
And left me naught but sighs. 
May the adage then, &o. 
I 
was sighing in my sleep, love, 
But brushed away the tear, 
Quickly with it went the grief, love, 
That filled my soul with fear: 
For the storm was o'er, and stars, love, 
Twin stars began to shine, 
I 
awoke and found thy eyes, love, 
Were gazing into mine. 
May the adage then, &o. 
ANITA. 
The following Ballad is founded on a 
tragic and affecting incident in 
the retreat of an Italian chieftain, across the Apennines, with his 
beloved wife Anita and a few faithful followers. 
His little band 
scattered, himself hunted down by land and sea, he found a 
momentary 
refuge at Rimiui, where Anita died from exhaustion. 
But he could 
not stay to perform his last office of affection—and tore himself away 
from her unburied corpse, which was cared for by the rude peasantry 
of the district, who scarce recognized in the poor wasted form the 
great chieftain's wife.

Thou dost not speak to me, mine own, 
The love-light's dim within thine eye, 
Thy beating heart has stiller grown, 
Alas! I 
know thou too must die; 
In fight the soldier braves his death, 
The sailor his upon the foam, 
But oh! let woman's latest breath 
Be drawn 'mid weeping friends at home. 
CHORUS. 
Anita, Anita, heaven is thy only home, 
Anita, Anita, heaven is thy only home. 
In every fen the foemen ride, 
Their seamen sail on every wave; 
I 
may not kneel, love, by thy side, 
Or lay rue in thy lonely grave. 
The stranger's hand will strew thy bed 
With all the sweet flowers of the year!— 
The stranger's hand will strew thy bed 
With all the sweet flow'rs of the y( ar. 
Farewell! my last sad prayer is said, 
No longer may I 
linger hero. 
Anita, Anita, ite.

FOR THAT'S TOO THIN„ 
Written and sung by TONY PAsron. 
If a 
lassie says she loves you, 
Then puckers, up her chin, 
Why, tell her, go to thunder, 
For that's too thin. 
If a 
politician boasteth 
lie's ever honest been, 
Why, tell him drop upon himself, 
For that's too thin. 
If a 
churchman says be honest, 
Ilimselt upon the skin. 
Why, tell him go to Blazes, 
For that's too thin. 
If a 
butclmr sells, for lamb, 
Some mutton, tough as tin, 
Just tell him . to go bang himself; 
For that's too thin. 
If a 
neighbor comes to borrow, 
And his breath exudeth gin, 
Why, tell him to dry up—the fool., 
For that's too thin. 
If your wifey gives you coffee 
Not sweetened worth a 
pin, 
Exclaim " She's sweet upon herself, 
For that's too thin." 
if a 
fellow treads upon your toes, 
Asks pardon with a 
grin. 
Why, tell hint to go—" shoot himself, 
For that's too thin." 
If a 
doctor says he'll cure you,. 
For fees extends his tin, 
Why, tell him " quack for beetle worms, 
For that's too thin." 
If a 
woman shrieks, affinity, 
And lives in deeper sin,. 
Just tell her what the matter is, 
" 
That that's too thin." 
If a 
lad his poverty proclaims, 
And squanders piles of tin, 
Just say, " You know how ' tis yourself, 
But that's too thin." 
If a 
conductor takes your fare. 
And tries the thing again, 
Just say, " My friend, go shake yourself, 
For that's too thin." 
If when you go to take a 
smile. 
Some bummer says " I'm in," 
Just tell him " Alastle hash in h-1, 
For that's too thin." 
And so a 
thousand little tricks 
You'll meet in daily din,. 
Which, if you only fathom, 
You'll learn are all " too thin."-
HEAR ME SAY MY LITTLE PRAYER.

O'er the dark and stormy waters 
Fell the fast and chilling rain ; 
And the vessel, speeding onward, 
Braved the fierce and angry main. 
Sheltered in the pleasant cabin, 
Spoke the little one so fair, 
"Come and kneel beside me, mamma, 
Hear me say my little prayer." 
CHORUS. 
Sweetly fell the loving accents 
Ofthe little child so Mir— 
" 
Come and kneel beside me, mamma, 
hear me say my little prayer." 
While without the storm was beating, 
Kneeling by the mother's side, 
Little snow-white hands uplifted, 
Prayed, the mother's joy -and pride. 
Oh ! her face so",ealin and trusting, 
Seemed a 
gentle angel's there, 
While her rosy lips repeated, 
" 
Hear me say my little prayer." 
Sweetly fell the loving accents, •Ste. 
Darkly, sadly dawned the morrow; 
Never more those lips so sweet, 
To that pale and weeping mother 
Words of joy and love repeat. 
Far above the wreck and tumult, 
In the land so bright and fair, 
Angels hear the mother's darling 
Sweetly say her little prayer. 
Sweetly fell the loving accents, :lc.

Come, for my arms are empty I 
Come, for the day was long!

Oh, how my heart beats 
Whenever I 
hear his rat-a-tat-tat-tat. 
[Repeat 
No music so sweet, with joy my heart beats, 
When I 
hear my love knock at the door. 
He has not yet proposed, 
But I 
think he will soon 
My mirth I've to hide with a 
frown, 
For I 
know the dear fellow 
has often began, and as oft in confusion broke down, 
lie has vowed to be mine, 
in fact we've both vowed 
Each other to love and adore. 
Ah, where's the girl, whose heart beats not fast 
When she hears her love knock at the door. 
Oh, how my heart beats, Stc.

THE STREAM AND THE WILLOW. 
Words by J.

CARPENTER. 
Music by STEPHEN GLovsa. 
Sung by ALICE DUNNING LINGARD and Miss D. LINGARD. 
Sister ! if the gift were ours 
To change ourselves to birds or flow'rs, 
And we have read in legends old 
Such pow'rs were given to maidens bold, 
Tell me which you'd choose to be 
A stream, a 
flow'r, a 
bird or tree : 
Tell me which you'd choose to be, 
A stream, a 
flow'r, a 
bird or tree. 
Ours is but a 
fancy's dream, 
Yet how sweet to be a 
stream, 
Knowing nothing but repose 
From morning's light to ev'ning's close ! 
Oh ! how sweet is fancy's dream ! 
How sweet is fancy's dream ! 
011! how sweet is fancy's dream ! 
How sweet, how sweet is fancy's dream. 
I 
would be some tranquil stream 
Flowing 'neath the summer beam, 
Murmuring a 
quiet song 
To the valley all day long; 
Sleeping in the moon's pale light---
Singing ever through the night ! 
Sleeping in the moon's pale light ; 
Singing ever, singing ever through the night 
Ours is but a 
fancy's dream, 
Yet how sweet to be a 
stream, 
Knowing nothing but repose 
From morning's light to ev'ning's close ! 
Oh ! how sweet is fancy's dream ! 
How sweet is fancy's dream ! 
Oh ! how sweet is fancy's dream ! 
How sweet, how sweet is fancy's dream.

STREAM AND THE WILLOW.—CoNcLuDED. 
If thou wouldst a 
streamlet be, 
I 
would form some willow tree; 
That I 
might not leave thy side 
But weep forever in thy tide: 
Cr, perchance would shelter those 
Who envied thee thy sweet repose! 
Or, perchance would shelter those 
Who envied thee thy sweet repose! 
Ours is but fancy's dream 
Thou the willow, I 
the stream, 
We will never parted be 
Like the stream and willow tree I 
Oh ! how sweet is fancy's dream 
how sweet is fancy's dream! 
Oh how sweet is fancy's dream! 
How sweet, how sweet is fancy's dream. 
Like the streamlet and the tree, 
We will never parted be; 
Thou shalt weep when I 
am low, 
But my love for thee shall flow: 
And the memory of me, 
The stream that still shall flow for thee! 
And the memory ot me, [for thee. 
The stream that still shall flow, that still shall flow 
Ours is but fancy's dream 
I 
the willow thou the stream, 
We will never parted be 
Like the stream and willow tree! 
Oh ! how sweet is fancy's dream! 
How sweet is fancy's dream ! 
Oh! how sweet is fancy's dream! 
How sweet how sweet is fancy's dream,

HOW DELIGHTFUL I 
VALgg, 
Words by A RTHUR SKETCHLEY. 
Music by J. T. lioLtor. 
Sung by ALICE DUNNING LINGARD. 
Oh how delightful, Oh how entrancing, 
From this drear thraldom soon to be free. 
With wildest joy then, my heart is dancing, 
Dancing so gaily now with glee. 
From morn till night, imprisoned here 
Passed we our days in gloom and fear. 
No joys to cheer us, no delight, 
All was dreary, nothing bright. . 
Now how delightflul, how entrancing 
From this drear thraldom soon to be free, 
With wildest joy, then. 
My heart is dancing, now with glee ! ! Ah 
Dancing so gaily now with glee ! Ah I

My heart is dancing now with glee! 
Oft when dark shadows are o'er us creeping, 
And check the throbbing of youthful hearts ; 
Hope like sunbeam watch near us keeping. 
Breaks thro' the gloom, and joy hnarts. 
No longer shall we droop and pine 
In dreary hours our life away. 
Wien clouds are darkest oft doth shine 
Softly and brightly hopes ray. 
Yes how delightful, now how entrancing 
From this drear thraldom soon to be free, 
WiCi wildest joy, then. 
My heart is dancing, now wit'i glee ! Mi ! Ah 
Dancing so gaily now with glee ! Ah! Ah !

WINNING THE GLOVES. 
Sung by W ILLIAM H . 
LINGARD. 
LITTLE Fan was a 
flirt, and young Harry in vain 
Had striven for courage his heart to explain ; 
He thought that she loved him, yet day after day, 
When it came to the point he had nothing to say : 
He sighed when she smiled, when she flirted he frowned, 
As out of his sight, with a 
laugh and a 
bound, 
Little Fanny would trip with a 
heart light and gay, 
Singing " Fetters to-morrow—but freedom to- day!" 
Little Fanny would trip with a 
heart light and gay, 
Singing " Fetters to-morrow—but freedom to-day!' 
it happened that Fanny, that sweetest of loves, 
One day was in want of a 
new pair of gloves, 
And going where Harry had fallen asleep, 
She thought it no harm if she just took a 
peep. 
"Yes, there sleeps my bashful young gentleman now, 
I 
want some new gloves, and I'll have them I 
vow!" 
She then on the impulse proceeded to act, 
When Barry awoke—she was caught in the fact. 
" 
Dear Fanny," he cried, " now you can't get away, 
Crying ' Fetters to-morro w'—i've caught you to-day." 
The words to his lips came at Cupid's command, 
" 
I'll give you the gloves, in exchange for the hand; 
You know hand and glove' is a 
saying as old 
As the forfeit you claim!" 
Say, was Harry too bold ? 
Besides, if a 
maiden has courage to kiss, 
Should her beau such a 
good opportunity miss? 
She blushed her consent, said, " Perhaps you are right, 
Mind the size—six three quarters—and let them be white." 
Thus easily caged are the wildest of doves, 
So maidens be careful in winning the gloves!

UNDER THE DAISIES. 
By 
H. 
MILLARD. 
Sung by MISS D. LINGARD. 
I've just been learning the lesson of life, 
The sad, sad lesson of loving, 
And all of its powers for pleasure or pain 
Been slowly and sadly proving : 
And all that's left of the bright, bright dream, 
With its thousand and brilliant phases 
is a 
handful of dust in a 
coffin hid— 
A 
coffin under the daisies. 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And thus forever throughout this wide wo 
Is love a 
sorrow proving, 
There are still many sorrowful ti 
But the saddest of all is 1 
The life of some is wor 
For fate—a 
higl 
And far bett 
Is a 
1 
rid, 
rings in life, 
ving; 
se than Death, 
wall oft raises, 
r 
than life with two hearts estranged, 
ow grave stared with daisies, 
he beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies. 
And so ' tis better we lived as we did 
The summer of love together, 
And that one of us tired and lay down to rest 
Ere time coming of wintry weather; 
For the saddest of love is love grown cold, 
And ' tis one of its surest phases, 
So I 
bless my lot, tho' with breaking heart, 
For that grave enstarred with daisies. 
The beautiful, beautiful daisies, 
The snowy, snowy daisies.

Let me sing a 
song of the olden time, 
Let me dream a 
dream of the past, 
While the stars are bright in their golden light. 
And the night shades are gath'ring ffist, 
I 
would weave a 
chaplet of cypress leaves, 
And gem it with cypress flowers, 
And crown the grave where the wild flowers wave, 
O'er the friend of my happier how's. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am sad to-night, though the stars are bright, 
And my cheeks have lost their hue, 
For mem'ry brings on her raven wings, 
Sad dreams of the fallen true. 
For mem'ry brings on her raven wings, 
Sad dreams of the fallen true. 
Sad echoes are floating upon the air, 
The wind is sobbing a-loud, 
And the daisy and violet blooming sweet, 
Are my brave soldier's only shroud, - 
But I'll weave a 
chaplet of cypress leaves, 
And gem it with cypress flowers, 
And stars are bright, in their golden light, 
And the night shades are gath'ring fast. 
I

And your peace and calmness destroy, 
Conquer'd you are then surely,

For wounded only slightly,

Therefore, gentlemen, be not deceived, 
It is best from Cupid to flee, 
fie is one that is not to be blieved, 
Or you must his victim soon be. 
But spite of all this danger, 
You can't resist his art, 
Too lovely is this ranger, 
Sweet is the death by his dart.

My brain it almost reels ;

The silver on her heels, 
I

What's that I

No, no, I 
was mistaken ; 
My heart to you appeals 
To help me find my charmer with 
The silver on her heels. 
I'll wait another hour or two, 
Perhaps she may regret : 
That she has left me here alone 
To worry and to fret ; 
Then I 
will seek her let her be 
Where e'er that mind conceals; 
I'll know the sound fin sure I 
will, 
Of the silver on her heels, 
Vu know the sound I'm sure I

Of the silver on her heels.

Our woods and groves and sunny skies, 
And all the haunts by love made dear, 
No longer charm your restless eyes, 
You go despite my falling tear; 
When foreign scenes and faces new, 
Your heart beguiles from thoughts of me, 
Remember, love, that I 
am true, 
I 
wait for thee, I 
wait for thee; 
Remember, love, that I 
am true, 
I 
wait for thee, I

The wings of time move slowly o'er, 
My lie now desolate and drear, 
But hope still beams when dark clouds lower, 
And mem'ry soothes with fancies dear; 
I 
wander thro' the groves alone, 
Your absence brings long days to me, 
A.11 night In prayer to heaven's throne, 
I 
wait for thee, I 
wait for thee; 
All night in prayer to heaven's throne 
I 
wait for thee, I 
wait for thee. 
The days and years go swiftly by, 
The star of hope no longer gleams, 
Life light and love fade from her eyes, 
And gone for aye are her fond dreams, 
The angel who is true to all, 
Found her at last on bended knee, 
Her pale lips moaned the loving call, 
I 
wait for thee, I 
wait for thee; 
Her pale lips moaned the loving call 
I 
wait for thee, I 
wait for thee.

ROW TO CURE A. DRUNKARD. 
Written, Composedand Sung by W M. LIOIZACE LINGARIL 
The silver moon was shining. all the stars they twinkled clear, 
All nature had retired to rest, and nothing cculd you hear; 
When across the daisy'd meadow, a 
voice it came along, 
" 
We wont go home till morning," was the burden of tbe song. 
'Twas a 
dry goods merchant of Xew York, returning from the fair. 
With runny an old acquaintance, he had got quite tipsy there; 
Thu' he loved his dogs and horses, his children and his wife, 
Yet far above them all he loved a 
spree as Lis life. 
His wife 
as broken-hearted, as he rolled in through the door, 
And fell his length, full five feet ten, quite tipsy on the floor. 
Says she, " no longer this shall last, for I 
think I've found a 
plan, 
To pay him out all for the past, and cure a 
drunken man." 
She called in all the neighbors, they all sympathised, be sure, 
And all agreed to aid the wife, when she proposed the cure. 
The merchant he laid senseless, while they pursued their plan, 
And this is how they fancied they could cure a 
drunken man. 
In a 
winding.sheet they laid him, with a 
shroud around his head, 
And they packed him in a 
coffin, then closing down the lid,' 
In mourning they all sat around, tables rattled like a 
drum 
As they drank a 
pleasant journey on his way to kingdom come. 
To their delight, in great affright, the merchant raised Iris head, 
Amazed he cried, " Am I 
alive or numbered with the dead?" 
With us you're in the other world." in solemn voice they cried, 
" 
Then give us a 
drop of something hot, I've had nothing since I 
died." 
"You're dead," said they. " What matter that, I 
keenly feel the 
thirst, 
And since I've gone, why here I've come, so of course I 
know the 
wo at ; 
The man that in the other world took his bourbon and his beer, 
Will never fail, if near it, to take his quantum here." 
So let's enjoy life's pleasures, we've pains enough, I'm sure, 
A 
glass or two won't kill a 
man: it often proves a 
cure, 
To banish care and sorrow, so should you feel it hero ; 
atist be advised, and drown them in a 
glass of good old beer.

Now they talk of Ifa ,s 
dr, Co, 
And their noted bitter beer, 
And how it gladdens up the 
And gives the spirits cheer. 
'Tis bo.-ih and foolish nonz.ense, 
I 
say to everybody; 
If they like mire, would enoy their life, 
Why let them take to toddy. 
For whisl.zey toddy, boy3, will ba -ish melancholy ; 
While bitter beer is tiller cheer—so give me whiskey toddy. 
Then hurrah for Nvhiskey toddy 
Let all that beverage sup, 
For in taking that sweet spirit down 
You keep your spirits up. 
While bitter beer's a 
cold chap, 
That has not half the body, 
To keep the soul alive, d'ye see, 
Like good cld whiskey toddy. 
For whiskey toddy, ooys, (tc. 
In b'tter beer no friendship's Lund, 
If s;), you'll own ' as cold, 
While everybody says in toddy 
A wa .

A liquor store dealer was fined 
For fiel.ing ( after hours) in Ids lobby ; 
But the magi,trates they let him off 
When they heard 'twas only toddy. 
For whiskey toddy, boys, cke.

If your & fir love frown on you, 
And fcr love gives back but scorn, 
Would you turn her kind and true, 
Rise you early on some morn. 
In the merry month of May, 
Ere from off the flow'rbig thorn 
Dewdrops bright have dried away, 
Dewdrops bright have dried away. 
Give you love instead of scorn, 
And be ever kind and true. 
Give you love instead of scorn, 
And prove ever kind and true. 
Ere the blush has left the sky, 
Then no other creature nigh, 
You must pluck for her a 
spray 
Without shaking out the dew, 
As you're tearing it away, 
For if this you neatly do, 
She'll most surely from that morn 
Give you love instead of scorn—ah 
Give you love instead of scorn, 
And be over kind and true, 
Give you love instead of scorn 
And prove ever kina and true.

It wasn't then invented.

YOU A ND I, 
Music and words by CLARIBEL. 
Sung by A LICE D LINICE!IG LINGARD.-
We sat by the river, you and I, 
In the sweet summer time, long ago, 
So smoothly the water glided by, 
Making music in its tranquil flow ; 
We threw two leaflets, you and I, 
To the river as it wandered on, 
And one was rent and left to die, 
And the other floated forward all alotze, 
And oh ! we were sadden'd, you and I, 
For we felt that our youth's golden dream 
Might fade, and our lives be sever'd soon, 
As the two leaves were parted in the stream. 
'Tis years since we parted, you and I, 
In that sweet summer time, long ago, 
And I 
smile as I 
pass the river by, 
And I 
gaze into the shadow depths below. 
I 
look on the grass and bending reeds, 
And I 
listen to the soothing song, 
And I 
envy the calm and happy life, 
Of the river as it sings, and flows along,. 
For—oh how its song brings back to me, 
The shade of our youth's gollen dream, 
In the days ere we parted, you and I, 
As the two leaves were parted on the stream.

Sung by ALICE DUNNING LINGARD. 
All nature sweetly smiles around, 
In all the air is heard the hum 
Of joyous The, and from the ground 
The flowers tell that spring has come, 
The swallow gossips in the sky, 
The humming bee is on the wing, 
And gentle breezes drifting by, 
From southern climes sweet odors bring. 
The wood resounds with song of birds, with song of birds 
The brook is sing-ing, sing-ing in the vale. 
And tinkling bells of browsing herds, of browsing herds 
Are echoed back from hill and dale. 
The apple blOssoms lightly dance, 
The meads are spangled o'er with dew 
And reveling in the sun's bright glance 
The cloudlets play in fields of blue, 
In fields of blue, in fields of blue. 
(Laughing) Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, ah 
Tra la In tra la la trim tra In la tra In la, 
My heart is like the sweet spr:ng time 
-Upon a 
golden flood adrift; 
For youth and hope are in their prime, 
And love makes youthful blood run swift, 
No cloud obscures my future sky,. 
My sails are 131 wn by zephyrs sweet ; 
A fairy land is flitting by 
And Love is smiling at my feet.

Let thy sweet touch linger on each gentle tone, 
And with words of feeling speak to me alone.

All its rich cords sounding through those anthem swells, 
Not with rapid cadence, not with rushing pow'r, 
But softly, softly falling, like a 
summer shower. 
CTIORUS: 
Falling, falling softly, 
Like a 
summer shower. 
Thus I 
still would hear thee, calm and dear and low, 
Wave on wave still deepning, bid thy numbers flow, 
Till the strain come o'er me with a 
charm divine, 
And thy soul of music enters into mine. 
_Let thy sweet words linger with their balmy power, 
And softly, softly falling like a 
summer shower.

A YOUNG GIRL OF THE DAY. 
Comic Song and Chorus for Female voices. 
Compoaed and Sung by Wm. llonecn LINGARD. 
I've often heard and so have you, 
Some people rave and say. 
How different years ago were girls 
To those of the present day ; 
For my part I 
don't care a 
straw 
At what old maids may say 
Of the style of dress and winning ways, 
Of the young girl of the day. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, a 
model of fashion you here see in me, 
So happy and free, where'er I 
may be, 
Young girls who'd be stylih, take pattern by me, 
No matter what old maids may say— say. 
Some men there are who run us down. 
And say we dress to gay : 
But when they go to their clubs at night 
'Bout that they've naught to say. 
But I 
would like to see the man 
Who to my face would tell, 
Who thought himself superior 
To a 
dashing pretty belle. 
Oh a 
model of fashion, etc.

Sung by ALICE DUNNING LINGARD. 
Oh take me to thy heart again, 
I 
never more will grieve thee, 
All joys are fled and hope is dead 
If I 
indeed must leave thee. 
Forgive the wild and angry words, 
This wayward heart bath spoken, 
I 
did not dream those cherished chords 
So lightly could be broken. 
Then take me to thy heart again, 
I 
never more will grieve thee, 
All joys are fled and hope is dead 
If I 
indeed must leave thee, 
If I 
indeed must leave thee. 
I 
think how very sad and lone, this 
Life would be without thee, 
For all the joys my heart bath known 
Are closely twin'd about thee. 
Oh teach me to subdue the pride, 
That wounded thee so blindly, 
And be once m 
ire the gentle guide 
Who smil'd on me so kindly. 
Oh, take me to thy heart again, dx, 
ON A RAINY DAY. 
Music by OPERTI. 
Sung by Win. HouncE 
Oft times the world may laugh and jeer at what I'm going to say, 
That is, provide yourselves, my friends, in case of a 
rainy day; 
For if you don't when you grow old, on what I 
say depend, 
can't help yourself, ' tis hard to find a 
friend. 
CHORUS. 
So now be careful and be wise, and like me stow away, 
A 
little pelf to protect yourself, in case of a 
rainy day. 
Be not extravagant nor mean, have just what YOU require, 
Be kind and provident to all, it is my heart's desire; 
When I 
see my fellow creature is trodden down with strife, 
To help him on the road is a 
proud time of my life, 
So now be careful. Ste. 
" 
Waste not, want not," my motto is, a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
And here's another I'd prescribe : 
touch nothing out of reach:" 
For " hocesty's best policy," so honest people say, 
And just remember, t 
bough but small, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c, 
"A pin a 
day is a 
groat a 
year," which proves that the smallest mite, 
Put by will soon accumulate, and show my words are right ; 
So persevere when in your ;\ oath, and then when old you'll say, 
I 
care not low the world treats me, I 
thought of a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, Sc.). 
I'm bale, I'm jolly, you can see, and I 
like my friends to call. 
Tho' the best of friends I've ever found was my pocket after all ; 
For that old friend sticks to me still thro' thick and thin, I 
say, 
If you would be advised by me, put by for a 
rainy day. 
So now be careful, &c. 
" 
A friend in need's a 
friend indeed," but bow often when your poor, 
Those friends will pass you one by one, and on you close the door; 
So let your motto be like mine, what'er the world may say, 
Look out for number one, that is. put by for a 
rainy day. 
So new be careful, Sze.

The freedom to use my tongue pleased me no doubt. 
For a 
woman, you know, would be nothing without, 
I 
went towards the mill without any delay, 
And conned o'er the words I 
determined to say,-
But when I 
came near it, I 
found it stock still! 
" 
Bless my stars," then said I, " scold him rarely I 
will." 
"

The miller to market that moment was gone, 
But the mill it was left to the care of his son ; 
Now though I 
can scold well, as any one can, 
I 
thought ' twere a 
pity to scold the young man! 
I 
said, " I'm surprised you can use me so ill,

A MAJOR IN THE NINTH. 
Comic Song and Chorus for Gentlemen. 
Written and Sung by Wm. nORACE LINGARD. 
I've just popp'd in not to intrude. 
But to relate, don't think t»e rude, 
The history of one who knows 
The world's inancenvcrs, its friends and foes. 
What care I 
for hard times 0, 
Oh ! I 
Oil ! Oh ! I 
Oh ! 
Laugh and be jolly is my motto, 
Oh! 
Oh! I 
Oh! 
CHORUS. 
Captain Jinks was once my name, 
" 
On the beach " it gained me fame. 
But, dear boys, my theory shall be, 
A Major in the Ninth for we. 
When out on drill I 
heard them say, 
In case of War they'd. run away, 
I 
simply reply like all the rest, 
Of peace or war we know which is best. 
In case of a 
rupture never fear, 
We shall be in the front not in the rear, 
For though volunteers 3 
ou'll find us all there 
Oh! I 
oh! I 
Oh ! 
Captain Jinks, ctc. 
Extremes in dress we often meet, 
Some dress gay and others neat, 
For lots of people I 
do know, 
Who cire.,;s too fast or else to slow. 
This is nobbv I 
hat YOU know, 
Oh ! high-o ! Oh ! high-o! 
For tho world believes in outside show, 
Oh ! high- o! Oh ! high- o !

TAKE THE WORD OF A MAN ABOVE SIXTY. 
Written by IVILLTAm, II. 
LINGARD. 
Things have so changed since I 
was a 
boy, 
That I 
think a 
few words I 
may perhaps say, 
Of the wonderful changes which have been made 
In the customs and manners of this present day. 
Since I 
was a 
boy—ha! there's no such things now— 
Ere fourteen years old they- act as though fifty, 
They think they are men, while yet schoolboys, I 
vow, 
So just take the word of a 
man above sixty. 
Boys will be boys is what used to be said, 
Boys wont be boys we now must bemoan ; 
Ere they're out of their teens they act swells abroad, 
When they used to find innocent pleasure at home. 
Girls are as bad—in my younger days 
They were taught to be useful, frugal and thrifty ; 
A 
far better plan than that pursued now, 
So just take the word of a 
man above sixty. 
There's nothing to beat that jolly old coach, 
To think of it makes me feel young again ; 
On that you could enjoy the fine country air, 
Which you can't in a 
dusty and smoking old train. 
You felt hearty and hale on the top of the coach, 
By four prancing horses thus drawn along swiftly ; 
The pleasure of that you young ones don't know, 
So just take the word of a 
man above sixty. 
Then people dressed to their stations in life; 
Of home they thought first, of dress perhaps next ; 
But now you can't tell the poor from the rich, 
Except the poorer they are the louder they dress. 
Expenses increase to keep pace with their dress, 
Which can't be done, they find very quickly— 
That dress causes half of the crimes in the papers, 
So just take the word of a 
man above sixty.
