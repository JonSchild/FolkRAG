BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 
IIAP.RY SrAxwoon, the man who makes humorous " chin music" to 
the accompaniment of the banjo, entered this existence at Coburg, Cana-
da, a 
son of American parents. 
Wishing to be on time during his stay on 
this wondrous sphere, he essayed the trade of a 
watch-maker, but, as he 
himself expresses it, on account of his eye- sight, he " couldn't see it." 
We next find the young man from " over the border" at work in the 
establishment of the New-Haven Clock Company. In the Elm City the 
young clock-maker connected himself with an amateur minstrel troupe, 
of which the late A. C. Stone was also a 
member. 
Taking to the road 
under the title of " The American Burlesque Opera Troupe," they inau-
gurate their season one winter's night in 1860, at North Haven, Conn., to 
" 
good house." The next " stand " was at Guilford, and the sum total 
of the receipts $ 8. 
After the performance harry walked home, a 
distance 
of twelve miles, carrying a " grip-sack " tall of wardrobe in one hand, and 
a 
banjo encased in a 
green baize bag in the other— the management having 
become bankrupt. 
Perhaps his dreams or future greatness in minstrelsy 
were for a 
time as clouded, but not more so, than when he made his first 
appearance on Broadway, one evening in 1802, under the cognomen of 
Harry Spencer: with what success may be conjectured when it is known 
that the ambitious banjoist was " fired out" into Crosby street, followed 
by a 
shower of old shoes, stuffed clubs, etc., having make a 
failure dire and 
dreadful. 
His first engagement with a 
legitimate organization was with Duprez 
& Green, in 1863, with whom he remained the entire season, doing banjo 
solos, and, with Lew Benedict, the first double essence ever performed on 
the minstrel stage. 
In the summer season of 1864, he played a 
short engagement at lino-
ley's, Brooklyn; the same autumn joining Skiff & Gaylord, with whom he 
remained three years, a 
portion of the time occupying the tamborine end. 
His succeeding engagements were with the leading companies of the 
country, and need but a brief recapitulation: Lloyd & Bidaux, five 
months; Kelly & Leon, 720 Broadway, N.Y., six months; joined Cotton & 
Sharpley for a 
travelling tour, and, on the withdrawal of Ben Cotton, play-
ed on the bone end with Sam. Sharpley as tarabo. 
Next fulfilled an eight 
months' engagement at the Adelphi Theatre, Boston, under the manage-
ment of John Stetson, followed by a 
tour of the principal variety theatres 
in the leading cities. 
Appeared with Newcomb & Arlington, in New 
York, at she opening of their season. 
Travelled 'with Welch, Hughes & 
White for the succeeding, summer's tour, opening in the autumn at earn-
cross & Dixey's Opera House, Philadelphia; completing an eight months' 
season with Emerson & Maguire, in San Francisco, returned to New York 
and opened with them at 720 Broadway. Commenced a 
year's engagement 
with Dan Bryant, at his beautiful little minstrel palace, New York. 
Opened simultaneously at the Grand Opera House and Olympic Theatre, 
New York, in the winter of 1874, and, at the present writing, is picking 
the old cremona at the last named establishment, interpolating his music 
and song with those smart allusions to the topics of the hour and the 
follies of the times, which have made Harry Stanwood and his banjo famous 
all over the land.

THE CREAM-COLORED HORSE. 
As sung by Malay STANWOOD, 2,000 times, with wonderful success. 
Am.—" The Flying Trapeze." 
LISTEN to me, I've a 
sad tale of woe, 
A 
heart-rending story that you must all know, 
Of a 
beautiful girl who had me for her beau ; 
To marry we both did agree, 
Our vows were most solemnly plighted, 
And I 
was so happy of course, 
Like a 
cabbage, my hopes she then blighted 
For a 
man on a 
cream- colored horse. 
enones. 
He rode round the ring with the greatest of ease, 
Shot through the hoop like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Stood on his head while his toe he would seize, 
And flip-flapped all over the ring. 
I 
took Liza Jane to the circus one night, 
To witness this daring equestrain flight ; 
She applauded so loudly, they all thought she was tight, 
Goodness ! how jealous I 
got 1 
Says I, " Liza Jane, do be quiet," 
Says she, " you are not my boss." 
Then she hollered for two quarts of pea-nuts 
For the man on the cream- colored plug. 
cnonus. 
Still the gawk rode around the ring with vehemence, 
Shot through the hoop like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Stood on his head while his toe he would seize, 
And flip- flapped all over the ring. 
He came out again with a 
flop and a 
whirl, 
When he came right side up, he winked at my girl ; 
I 
had a 
great notion my cane then to twirl 
At this man in spangles and tights. 
She threw him a 
kiss back so quickly, 
For my feelings she had no respect ; 
And as he rode ' round the circle 
I 
wished that he might break his neck. 
SPOKEN.—But lie 
fJr, 
CHORUS. 
He rode round the ring, with utmost ease, 
Broke paper in the hoop, didn't touch knees, 
Stood on his bald head, and neck- tie would seize, 
This man on the skim- milk mule. 
(1)

THE CREAM-COLORED HORSE.—Continued. 
When we got home, we'd a 
terrible row, 
I 
called her false-hearted, she'd broken her vow, 
Says she, " quit my sight, I 
am done with you now, 
I'm engaged to the star of the ring, 
I'll be called on the bills 
Senorita,' 
We will travel together of course, 
I'll do a 
flip-flop on his eye-brow 
As he rides on his cream- colored horse." 
on onus. 
Don't touch him, harm him pot, the Epizootic he's got, 
The horse talks one way, the feller does not ; 
My song is now ended 
go to my cot, 
Please excuse that eccentric old mule. 
THE CHESTNUT MAN. 
Written expressly for FUREY STAN WOOD by the late J. B. MURPHY. 
On, listen to the doleful strain, 
That I'm a-going to sing you, 
About a 
tall Italian, and 
A 
gal that him did cling to; 
He kept a 
stand upon Broadway, 
hot roasted chestnuts selling, 
And the stamps he took in every day, 
his pockets all were swelling. 
There was a 
maiden short and fat, 
With feelings soft and tender, 
And she fell in love with the chestnut man, 
Because he was so slender, 
And he loved her with all his might, 
And called her " ducky honey," 
And sold her chestnuts every night, 
And wouldn't take any money. 
One day this maiden went for to go 
For to see her Italian lover, 
When she fell in front of an omnibus, 
And quickly was run over; 
When the chestnut man beheld the sight, 
And knew she was a 
corpus, 
He swallowed a 
quart of chestnuts down, 
And died of cholera morhus 
(2) 
'FAIR KATRINA, AND CARROTTY DEN. 
Written expressly for H ARRY STANWOOD, by the late J. 
B. 
MURPHY. 
On, list to me while I 
relate, 
The sad, untimely, cruel fate 
Of a 
galliant youth with carrotty hair, 
Who loved a 
German maiden fair. 
His name I 
cannot mentu-en, 
But the neighbors called him Carrotty Ben 
And through the country far and wide, 
All knew Katrina Kroutzeuklyde. 
CHOR US . 
Then list to the mournful tale I 
tell 
Of a 
love-sick youth, what him befell, 
how false Katrina, fat and fair, 
Deceived poor Ben with the carrotty hair. 
'Twas at a 
German pic-nic ball, 
That Carrotty Ben in love did fall, 
With the false Katrina, fat and fair, 
And waltzed and polka'd with her there, 
He told his love, and with a 
smile, 
She answered in Teutonic style : 
" 
Mine boy, I 
loves you, more as good," 
And so the matter was understood. 
So list, etc. 
Now Carrotty Ben without (rood sense, 
Rushed in and went to much expense ; 
He bought Katrina silks and rings, 
And lots of other curious things ; 
But on the day they were to wed, 
She fell down stairs and broke her head ; 
Then Carrotty Ben he felt so queer, 
lie drank a 
barrel of lager beer. 
Then list, etc. 
Now Carrotty Ben resolved to die, 
So he built a 
balloon and soared so high; 
Then out he jumped with a 
fearful lurch, 
And fell on the spire of a 
country church. 
The steeple run him through and through, 
And Ile sticks there still where all can view ; 
The sun has dried him very plain, 
And they use him now for a 
weather-vane. 
CHORUS. 
Now this was the tale I 
had to tell 
Of Carrotty Ben, what him befell; 
So lovyers all whatever you do, 
Beware the wiles of a 
German Jew. 
HARRY STANWOOD'S MABEL 
WALTZ. 
With different verses, sung by FtAnny STAxwoon. 
Oir ! 
my Hunkey Dory has gone West, 
! 
my Hunkey Dory, she was one of the best. 
How my heart does beat, under this ragged vest, 
For Hannah illioughlin, please give us a 
rest. 
Once I 
had a 
little dog, 
lie was so terribly small, 
That every time he'd wag his tail, 
You'd see no dog at all. 
Lord Byron was a 
naughty man, 
have you all to know, 
For further particulars inquire of Mistress 
Harriet Beecher Stowe. 
Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard, 
To get a 
drink of water, 
But when she got there, the cupboard was bare, 
And so was the Rat-catcher's daughter. 
How doth the little busy bee, 
Delight to bark and bite, 
And bow it gives me great delight 
To sing myself hoarse all night. 
COOKING IN DE KITCHEN. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
I 
NEVER shall forget, as long as I 
remember, 
A pretty little yaller gal, I 
met her last September; 
She smiled on me so sweet, she set my heart a-twitchin', 
This nice little yaller gal a- cooking in de kitchen. 
CHORUS . 
Oh, my, she was so bewitchin', 
This handsome little yaller gal a-cooking in de kitchen; 
My eye, she set my heart a-twitchin', 
This fascinating nigger wench a- cooking in de kitchen. 
The look she gave to me none could be prouder; 
I 
eat up all the sassingers and swallowed down de chowder, 
1 
put a 
bottle in my pocket just as I 
was wishin' 
To have a 
little spree with de damsel in the kitchen. 
Oh, my, etc. 
I 
commenced to get tight—the yaller gal got tighter, 
In come a 
six foot fig, he thought he was a 
fighter, 
I 
hit him in the bugle, and into him was pitchin', 
When he knocked me into a 
kettle of soup a-boiling in de kitch-
en. 
Oh, my, etc.

THINGS MIXED. 
As sung by HARRY STAN WOOD. 
Am.—" Mabel Waltz." 
I 
BOUGHT my girl a 
Thomas cat, 
She gave it the name of Julia; 
I 
told her that she mustn't do that, 
For it wasn't that kind of a 
kitten; 
She swore that she would be revenged, 
She'd go and cut her wizen; 
So she took a 
dose of suicide, 
And then committed arsenic. 
The boy stood on the burning deck, 
With his baggage checked for Troy; 
His hat flew off, and broke his neck, 
And his name was Mrs. McGinnis. 
Adam was the first man, 
As everybody knows, 
lie never paid any tailor's bill, 
For he he never wore no clothes. 
Captain Jinks and Pat Malloy 
On the beach at Long Branch. 
Benjamin Butler and General Grant 
Doing a 
double clog dance. 
The Grecian Bend is all the rage, 
It's the style they spend their stamps on; 
The next man to be president 
Is Elizabeth Cady Stanton. 
DICTIONARY ON DRAUGHT. 
DANCE, the boatman, dance, 
Dance all night till breind daylight, 
And go home with the girls in the morning. 
CHANGE CARS. 
Mingle in the mazes of the dance, thou knight of the oar, 
while the resplendent luminary of the day has withdrawn his 
light from the earth, till the bright Aurora gilds the eastern 
sky with golden light, and then with thy characteristic gallantry 
accompany the fair and unsophisticated participants of thy 
pleasures to their paternal mansions.

Give me a 
toothache, 
or sore eyes, in preference to such kind of pies. 
The farmer 
takes his gnarliest fruit, ' tis wormy, bitter, and hard to boot; 
they leave the hull to make us cough, and don't take half the 
peelings off. 
Then on a 
dirty cord they're strung, and from 
some chamber- window hung; until they're ready to be made 
in pies. 
Tread on my corns, or tell me lies, hut don't pass me 
dried apple pies.

STANWOOD'S SONG OF SONGS. 
Sung by ILutnY STANwoon, with great success. 
I 
ONCE did love a " YaIler Gal," 
They called her " Charming Sal ;" 
She was the " Mother Dear " 
To the " Peanut Gal," 
She used to go " Out a-Sin?in' " 
In the " Merry Month of May," 
Along with the " Nice Yount • Man," 
They called him " Peter Gray." 
" 
The Bold Dragoon" and " Sairy Sykes" 
Went out to have some fun, 
Along with " Old Bob Ridley," 
To the " Battle of Bull Run ;" 
They went to the •` Limerick Races," 
Where they all drank good " Old Rye ;" 
And all go " Rolling Home in the Morning, Boys," 
"When the Swallows Homeward Ply." 
" 
Where is my Boy To- night 1" 
Says my dearest " Nancy Till." 
He's along with " Old Joe Bowers," 
Down. by that " Dear Old Mill." 
Then on the " Raging Canawl " 
" 
Gently glides the Bonnie Boat," 
And " You mustn't Despise a 
man 
Because he wears a 
Ragged Coat." 
" 
Lightly row the Boat," 
" 
Jamie's on the Stormy Sea," 
Along with " Captain Kidd ;"

When I 
met with " Polly Perkins?" 
" 
I 
likes a 
good drop of Beer," 
And so does " Johnny Schmoker," 
And the " Yankee Volunteer." 
I 
suppose you all know " Pat Maloy," 
The " Boy with the Auburn Hair," 
Who, along with " Mollie Bawn," 
Sat in the " Vacant Chair ;" 
" 
Kiss, but never tell," says she ; 
" 
I 
felt I 
can't tell how:" 
" 
0, Glory Halladu-jerum," 
" 
Why don't they do so now 1"

THE CHICAGO LOVERS. 
BANJO SOLO. 
Composed and sung by ILARRT STA:415'00D. 
OF 
a 
hearthending trag-e-dy, 
A story I 
will tell, 
Concerning a 
maid named Sa-ri Jane, 
And a 
youth called Sam-u-el; 
They loved each other ten-der-ly, 
And the Chicago people said, 
That now this cruel war was o'er, 
" 
These lov-i-ers should be wed." 
One day, as Sam was taking a 
walk, 
By the West Side fields, it seems, 
lie spied his charming Sa-ri Jane 
Walking with his rival, Jeems, 
So he jumped and raved upon the grass, 
And his golden red locks he tore, 
Saying, " Fare you well, my Sa-ri Jane, 
You ne'er shall see me more." 
Then he ran down by the river side, 
But being out of breath, 
He fell down on a 
big clamshell, 
And scraped himself to death ; 
When Sa-ri Jane she heard of this, 
She gave a 
piercing squall, 
Tied au Oshkosh grindstone round her neck, 
And jumped in the raging eanawl.

Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Just once more before I 
go , 
Tell me truly, will you miss me, 
As I 
wonder to and fro ? 
Let me feel the tender pressing 
Of your ruby lips to mine, 
With your (limp e 
hands caressing. 
And your snowy arms entwine. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro. 
Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
We may never meet again ! 
We may never roam together 
Down the dear old shady lane 
Future years may bring us sorrow, 
That our hearts but little know, 
Still of care we should not borrow ; 
Come and kiss me ere I 
go. 
Ah, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro. 
A COLORED CAMP ISIEETISG SONG. 
Written by Wm. H. DELERANTY and sung by DELERANTY and IIENGLER. 
I TOOK a 
stroll one afternoon, 
Sweet chil lren hear dis tale, 
'Twas in the latter part of June, 
Children, mark dis tale. 
I 
sat me down beside a

Children, hear me thro', 
I

That dream I'll tell to you.

Simi low, sweet children, 
The angels soon will come, 
Sim:, low, sweet children— 
They're coming to take me home. 
This an angel said to me. 
We're coming to take you home, 
Where all are happy, all are free— 
Coming to take you home, 
A 
Golden chariot then came down, 
Children, mark dis tale, 
lid dere was angels white and brow., 
Sinners, mark dis tale. 
Sing low, etc. 
Angels twined about my hair 
Fhwers wet, with dew, 
A wrath of roses fresh and fair, 
Sweet children hear me thro'. 
Soon they robed me all in white, 
Oh' the blessed Lamb. 
They set me in the chariot bright, 
Beside the blessed Lamb. 
Sing low, etc, 
Then I 
woke up from my dream, 
Den I 
hove a 
sigh, 
There ! was beside the stream, 
And tears was in my eye; 
I 
took it for a 
warning sent, 
So Din prepared to die. 
Don't faiere for me. I'm well content, 
And I'm prepared to 
Sin ,, low, etc.

THAT'S TTT.
P. KIND OF A GAWK I AN. 
Written and Composed by Wm. H. DELEHANTY. 
On my name is Timothy Harmless, 
From a 
land that's wide and wild, 
I'm a 
regular mule in harness, 
And a 
wild- cat when I'm riled ; 
Yes, a 
Buffalo Bill, by jingo! 
All the way from Huberdarn, 
But I 
ain't much on the lingo, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
CHORUS. 
But how is this for harmless, 
While I 
sling my harness, 
Yes I'm from tie rural district, 
I'm a 
Cincinnati ham, 
And I 
came to see the Elephant, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
I'm a 
jayhawk from the country, 
As you all can plainly see, 
Tho' I 
ain't no Mace-O'Baldwin, 
Nor a 
Heenan-Morrisey ; 
While I 
don't use knife or pistol, 
And I'm happy as a 
clam, 
I 
can make an eye look crystal, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
But how is this, etc. 
While I 
walked down the street k-day, 
Rigged up in awful style, 
I 
met a 
gal primped up so gay— 
And couldn't help but smile; 
We went into a 
restaurant, 
Had oysters, gin and jam, 
I 
let her put up every cent, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
ani. 
But how i 
tl, etc.

IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU FEEL THAT WAY. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
silAN'T forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
Her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
CHORUS, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left me 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the ices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as tho', etc. 
We met again ozle afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own; 
She blushed and said, go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
felt as tho', etc. 
The old man said that we might wed and so he crowned our 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass away, 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt a-P 
tho', etc.

,A. VIRGIN, ONLY 19 YEARS OLD. LcoNcLuDED1 
Her fingers were taper'd, her neck like the swan, 
Her nose was a 
turn-up, and her voice not too strong; 
In three weeks we were married, and the wedding bells told 
That I'd married a 
virgin—yes, a 
virgin, only 19 years old! 
The wedding-party broke up, and we retired to rest, 
But my hair stood right up when my bride she undress'd ; 
For a 
eartload of padding my young bride did unfold, 
A 
thing rather peculiar, very peculiar, for 19 years old I 
First, she took off her right foot, about a 
foot wide, 
Then she unscrewed her left ear and laid it aide, 
Then she pull'd out her right eye, on the carpet it roll'd; 
Thinks I, here's a 
virgin—what a 
virgin, only 19 years old I 
Next she unscrewed her right leg as far as the knee, 
Then pull'd off her fingers, I 
counted just three; 
Then on her left shoulder a 
large lump I 
did behold, 
So I 
said, there's a 
virgin—yes, a 
virgin, only 19 years old 
When she wiped off her eyebrows I 
thought I 
should faint, 
And scraped from her thin cheeks a 
cartload of paint ; 
When she pull'd off her black wig then her bald pate soon told 
That she was an old virgin, an old virgin, more than 19 years oia 
When she pull'd out her false teeth, I 
jumped up in terror, 
For her nose and her chin very near stuck together, 
From the chamber I 
stepp'd it, never more to behold 
This virgin not nineteen,—no, not nineteen, but 99 years old! 
Now, young men, take warning, e'er to church you go, 
Be sure your wife's perfect from the top to the toe, 
Or you'll pay for your folly, and like me be sold 
By sonic patch'd-up old virgin, cruel old rirgin,lymt 99 years old

WOULD I WERE MOST ANYTHING. 
Written and sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
On, would I 
were a 
bird, 
I'd rather be a 
bear, 
And in a 
big menagerie, 
For folks at me to stare ; 
I'd dance on my hind feet, 
Then asleep appear to be, 
And when they'd tickle me, 
I'd growl in the key of G. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
fish, 
I'd rather be a 
swallow, 
I'd fly so fast along the shore, 
I'd beat the lightning hollow ; 
And when the boys would come with guns, 
To shoot me on the wing; 
I'd wink at them with my off eye 
And " Shoo Fly " I 
would sing. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
giant, 
I'd act upon the stage ; 
In tragedy I'd play Hamlet, 
For you know it's all the rage; 
In dress like an Indian Tobacco sign, 
With moccasins number sixteen ; 
To froth at the mouth I'd chew brown soap, 
And eat up all the scenes. 
Oh, would I 
were a 
cat, 
I'd rather be a 
dog, 
A 
little two ounce black and tan, 
As frisky as a 
frog ; 
But best of all I'd rather be, 
The one to please you all ; 
And hoping I 
have done so now, 
Good- night. till again

WE ALL HAVE FUN AT THE MATINEE. 
Written and sung by H ARRY ST.ANWOOD. 
I TELL you a 
little about the fashions, 
That you see upon the streets ; 
You'll see the dandy quills go dashing 
Past each pretty gal they meet, 
With pants so tight they can't sit down, sir, 
Low-cut vests they look so neat, 
Alpine hats with great big crowns, sir, 
And number seventeens on their feet. 
Hail Columbia, right side up side, 
Don't you wish you was me; 
I'm Captain Jinks of the horse marines, 
We all have fun at the matinee. 
Last week I 
went to the skating rink, 
To see the style and have a 
skate; 
I 
soon got acquainted with a 
pretty little gal, 
Her name was Matilda Gate fote sate, 
We talked and skated around the Rink, 
But soon got hungry and took a 
stew ; 
I 
said my stamps were in my other vest, 
But the man said, " Played out,that won't do." 
Hail Columbia, etc. 
I'm leaving thee in sorrow, Annie, 
On the four o'clock train I 
leave the place ; 
I'm a 
wandering refugee, 
I 
can whip Joe Coburn or Jem Mace. 
We parted by the river side, 
That happy day I 
can't forget, 
You tried to borrow a 
ten dollar note, 
But I 
couldn't see it ; no, you bet. 
CHORUS. 
Hail Columbia, right side up side, 
Yankee Doodle in the chair, 
feel just as happy as a 
big sun-flower, 
Three of a 
kind beats two pair.

THE MILWAUKEE SUICIDE. 
As sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
THIS song that I'll sing you is of a 
young maiden, 
Whose parents were healthy and wealthy, I'm sure, 
And how her relations did sadly neglect her, 
And all of the hardships she had to endure ; 
Her name was Amanda Augusta Belinda 
Paulina Victoria Mary Jane Brown ; 
Her father kept books for the Poor House inspector, 
While her mother sold peanuts in Milwaukee town. 
A 
noble young freedman haa cast his affections 
Upon this sweet damsel so beauteous and fair, 
And oft had they met in the little back parlor, 
In the tenement house where resided this pair ; 
But the course of true love was ne'er known to run smoothly, 
For one day the old man fiercely rushed to the room— 
He upbraided his daughter, and kicked out Alfonso, 
Which caused the young lovers much sadness and gloom. 
Alfonso went sadly up to the oil regions, 
Resolved to gain riches and buy real estate, 
Then return to Milwaukee, and wed the young maiden ; 
But be was unlucky, and met a 
sad fate; 
Ile garroted a 
stranger and went through his pockets, 
And took all his ducats and shekels of gold; 
But the Vigilance Committee, without judge or jury, 
They seized and hung up our young hero so bold. 
When the horrible news reached the town of Milwaukee, 
Old Brown he went crazy, and paid up his bills; 
Her mother sold out all her peanuts at cost, 
And then strangled herself with a 
box of blue pills, 
While the maiden she frantically rushed to the druggist's, 
And hastily swallowed twelve glasses of gin ; 
To the banks of the Erie Canal she feebly staggered, 
heaved several sighs, and then calmly dropped in.

" SONG OF THE ITTIRALD PERSONALS." 
Written and sung by HARRY STAN WOOD. 
On, for a 
few minutes pray grant your attention, 
As I 
wish some most comical facts just to mention, 
Though perchance you may think my good sense may be peril-
led 
By trying to make any fun from the Herald; 
At what I 
shall state some folks may look solemn; 
The part I 
shall read you will be the first column ; 
But explaining the subject is wasting your time, 
So here goes the Personals done up in rhyme. 
" 
Frank, come—Pm in trouble—or address Station D." 
"Now, John, mind the dog; I 
am dreaming of thee." 
" 
If this should by chance catch the eye of Miss Jane, 
She may learn what on paper we cannot explain." 
" 
I'm delighted to hear all passed off so merry, 
Dear Sally. 
Conic up to the Hamilton Ferry." 
"Jones has come back—be is a 
bully good fellow." 
"Mr. Smith, please return Mrs. Brown's umbrella." 
" 
Will the lady in black state her name and her age 
To the gent who sat next her in the Fifth avenue stage 7" 
"Jerry X., won't you please send me word of some sort l" 
",Friends may call in on Sunday should their whiskey run short." 
" 
Young man dressed in gray may return the cigars 
He removed by mistake from Third avenue cars." 
" 
Phcebe, meet me at Kelly & Leon's to-night, 
To see Nelse Seymour kick his leg high as a 
kite." 
" 
For adoption—a 
sweet little girl and her brother, 
Two orphans without any father or mother." 
" 
George is spending his money, I 
think, rather freely." 
"Jeff Davis sends love to his friend Horace Greeley." 
Kind friends, I 
leave off for fear I 
should offend, 
For the Personals never will come to an end ; 
I 
must go, as these lines have fulfilled my ambition, 
And write something myself for to- morrow's edition.

From Ireland was transported, and deprived of his liberty. 
There was McNamara. and Underwood, Bill

The likes of Bold Jack Donohoe was not in this country, 
For maintaining of the people's laws he fought so manfully. 
Sure he had rather roam the wide world through like a 
wolf or 
kangaroo, 
Than to live in British slavery, says Bold Jack Donohoe. 
Cho.—With me bele, AT. 
Then never shall it yet be said, that O'Donohoe the brave, 
Shall submit to British slavery, or ever be a 
slave; 
And when he closed his aching eyes to bid this world adieu 
Crying, all good people, pray for the soul of Bold Jack Donohoe. 
Cho.—With me bele, &c. 
MARY OF THE WILDWOOD. 
A 
BALLAD. 
ONCE in days departed 
Dwelt a 
lovely maid, 
Pure and simple-hearted, 
In the forest shade. 
Mary of the wildwood, 
Birdling blithe and free, 
Angel of my childhood, 
Still I 
dream of thee.

THE EUCHRE PARTY. 
A LITTLE STORY. 
JOIIN QUEEN, E. D. Gooding, Billy Carter, Sam Sharpley, 
Billy %Vest, Dr. Powell, Frank House and Harry Stanwood were 
sitting in a 
friend's house one evening, when one of the company 
proposed a 
game of Euchre; they all agreed, but Stanwood, as 
he had never played a 
game of cards, said he wished to be in-
structed. 
As luck would have it, lie played so Nvell, he was 
told by Dr. Powell, that it was a wonder to him why a 
little 
baby couldn't play Euchre. 
Stanwood said that a 
baby couldn't 
play Euchre, becau•le he couldn't ' go it alone." 
John Queen 
then said, '
supposina the mother 
takes it up' " " Well," says 
Stanwood, " that would be different; but,—providing thQ mo-
ther 
turned it down,' and held the 
right bower,' and 
let it go,' 
of course the child takes the trick." 
CONUNDRUM — What makes a 
chicken cross the street ? 
AN-
SWER.—Because it wants to get on the other side. 
(New.) 
By BOBBY NEWCOMB, written expressly for TIABBY STANWOOD, and sung 
by him with great success. 
A YOUNG roan lived in Jersey City, 
Number eleventeen hundred and fifty; 
A 
doctor store he kept so grand, 
And a 
business done quite thrifty, 
Until he met with a 
lovely gal— 
They called her smiling Jane— 
As she went by his shop, with a 
bird-like hop, 
And she drove him quite insane. 
At last he thought he'd speak to her, 
And walked up to her brightly; 
He says, " My love you are a 
dove." 
She says, " Oh, yes, sir, slightly." 
lie says, " Are you in for a 
man of my size ? 
With my drugs and medicines take me." 
Then she gave him such a 
grab that he turned quite drab, 
And they settled to be married on a 
Wednesday. 
Of course that day he went to church, 
But waited in vain for his loved one; 
lie went home to his store with his heart quite sore, 
And he waited until the clock struck one; 
lie walked up and down, on his face was a.frown, 
For he knew that his life was cursted; 
Eat a 
pound of sponge, in the bath-tub did plunge, 
And swelled like a 
bladder, and bursted. 
Ladies and gentlemen, one and all, 
Take a 
warning from this if you can, sirs ; 
But, as for myself, I'm safe on the shelf, 
'Cause they can't come it over a 
necromancer; 
But the poor young girl's fate I 
have not told ; 
It gives me quite a 
cold shiver ; 
She bought a 
pair of razors, and blew out her brains, 
And throwed herself into the river.

" HERE IT IS." 
BANJO CURIOS ITI ES . 
Sung by HARas STAN WOOD. 
FIRST VERSE. 
On, the times have grown very stiange, 
It's strange that it should be so ; 
And we all go in for change, 
For change is all the go; 
" 
There's a 
change in the things that I 
loved," 
I 
loved a 
maiden tall, 
But she chanced her love for a 
shiftless cove, 
One that had no change at all. 
For he spent all his change at a 
ball. 
SECO ND STANZ A. 
I 
went for to have some fun, 
And a 
skate on Central Park, 
But the cars got stuck in the snow, 
And they kept stuck there till dark; 
I 
started to walk down town, 
But I 
slipped and fell on my ear ; 
I 
frozed my toes and bunged my nose, 
And my eye-teeth ached with fear, 
And I 
won't get well in a 
year. 
THIRD ALTERATION. 
They've taken the bill boards down, 
For their board bills were too high; 
They can't live on the town, 
So they'll " pine " away and die ; 
Each leaned against his post, 
Till they all grew very lean, 
'Twas against their grain, but they didn't complain— 
They were old and weren't so green ; 
Oh ! would that it wouldn't have been. 
FOURTH VAS IFI CATION. 
Oh! I 
dreamed of my love last night 
In the lane, when the clock struch nine ; 
With my rival I 
had a 
tiaht. 
And he knocked me out of time; 
A policeman heard the row, 
And I 
climbed on a 
lumber pile, 
But he knocked me down and broke my crown, 
Because he said I 
was high ; 
When I 
woke it was all in my eye. 
(1) 
"HERE IT IS."—Continued. 
FI FTH INTERLUDE . 
Oh! beautiful isle of the sea, 
I 
shall never see you more; 
'Twas a 
capital C 
to me; 
The " ile" in the lamp on shore, 
But the ile has got so low, 
It don't give light any more, 
And the isle so bright has sunk out of sight, 
And the lamp did break on the shore, 
While the breakers loudly did roar. 
SIXTH AND LAS T HYPERBOLE. 
" 
Mother, oh 
sing me to rest," 
The rest I'll forget to sing; 
" 
Little bird, fly to your nest," 
And let the old banjo ring— 
The ring had a 
diamond set, 
And shone as bright as a 
star; 
My mother she sang " till the dim woods rang ;" 
"Johnny's come home from the war," 
But I 
never was off so far. 
SUSAN SMEARKASE. 
As sung by H ARRY STANWOOD. 
a 
broken-hearted foreigner, from Cheyenne I 
came, 
I'm a 
watchmaker in a 
crowd, and Slim Jim is my name; 
I 
courted a 
maiden whose name was Smearkase; 
I 
asked her to have me—her reply it was, yeas. 
CHORUS . 
She was beautiful as a 
catfish, her hair was sky blue, 
Was pretty little Susan Smearkase. 
Oh, how do you do I 
This maiden she had a 
gray-headed papa, 
Who would not accept me as his son-in-law: 
And to make matters worse, the bald-headed galoot 
Busted his fist all over my snoot. 
She was beautiful, etc. 
I 
had him arrested, but what was the use '? 
It only heaped on my head more abuse; 
The judge discharged him, but called me a 
beat, 
And gave me six months to work on the Nicholson pavemcnt 
in the street. 
She was beautiful, etc. 
When Susan beard I 
was anchored in jail, 
She swallowed a 
velocipede, run a 
foot in her nail, 
Hung herself on a 
clothes-horse, and when last was seen, 
Was bathing her moot in a 
glass of benzine. 
She was beautiful, etc.

THE DECEITFUL FLORENTINE . 
Sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
Ain.—" The Raging Canawl." 
THERE was a 
fair young mariner, 
%Vim sailed upon the sea ; 
His ship it was a 
ship of war, 
A 
lieutenant was he. 
He was a 
man of gallant mien, 
And not unknown to fame; 
Of high Italian parentage, 
O'Reilly was his name. 
This noble young Italian man 
Made love to Annie Lee ; 
He said that he did worship her, 
And she did worship he. 
But Annie Lee thought sailor men 
Were said to fickle be ; 
And she cried, " 0 ! noble Florentine, 
I 
ask a 
pledge from thee." 
Then spoke this noble Florentine, 
" 
My love is ever warm ; 
Take this ere button I 
bare cut 
From off my uniform, 
For why, it is the only one 
Our noble President 
And merry noble Commodore, 
Permits us to present." 
With these deceitful words he spake, straight-
Way he sailed across the sea, 
And stopped awhile in Limerick, 
A 
town in Italy ; 
And there forgetting all his vows, 
And of his former flame, 
He married an Italian girl, 
O'Connolly by name. 
When Annie Lee received the news, 
She gave a 
frightful start, 
And said, " You naughty, naughty man, 
Methinks you've broke my heart." 
And then she took a 
pistol up, 
But for a 
ball of lead ; 
Down deep into the deadly tube, 
His button rammed instead. 
(1)

THE DECEITFUL FLORENTINE.—Continued. 
She shot herself; now maidens all, 
Oh! listen unto me ; 
Don't trust too much a 
Florentine, 
Whose name is O'Reilly. 
Don't trust to sailors, and if you 
Would save your sinful souls 
Be careful when and where, 
You make such awful button holes. 
PETER STOREY. 
Sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
OLD Uncle Jake Scrucher Alucher, 
In the shin I 
got the tizer riser. 
Old Uncle Jake, go fetch Doctor Glory, 
In come Peter Storey, captain of the old propeller. 
Look out for Peter Storey, 
Long dead and gone to glory, 
Take care l's there before you, 
Keep dark and toe the mark, 
And look out for Peter Storey—do jog along. 
Old Uncle Bill, double-breasted in the back, 
A shoulder up the hill, 
Old Uncle Bill, what makes you look so solmcolly 7 
Take care, collur'd man, don't you care to come anigh me 
Knock-kneed and double jointed, 
Shoulder- shod and double-breasted, 
Parrot-toed and web-footed, 
Pot Pie, mind your eye, 
And look out for Peter Storey—do jog along. 
Do, little sis ; what's the matter, little sissy 7 
Cold chills run down the back of the chair, 
Do, little sis ; what's the matter, little sissy ? 
Collu red gemmen of the town are getting mighty tickler about 
you, 
Look out for little sissy, 
By-and-by she lick her missy, 
That's all—come and kiss me, thick lip—what a 
Ht, 
And look out for Peter Storey—do jog along.

MULDOON, THE SOLID MAN. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E.

in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. H ARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Written and sung by ED. H ARRIGAN in his popular sketch of" Who owns 
the Clothes Line " 
I AM a 
man of great influence, 
And educated to a 
high degree, 
I 
came here when small from Donegal, 
In the Daniel Webster, across the sea; 
In the Fourteenth Ward I 
situated, 
In a 
tenement house with my brother Dan ; 
By perseverance I 
elevated, 
And went to the front like a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
Go with me and I'll treat you dacent ; 
I'll set you down, and I'll fill the can; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
At any party or any raffle 
I 
always go as an invited guest; 
As conspicuous as General Granite, boys, 
I 
wear a 
rosebud upon my breast; 
I'm call'd upon to address the meeting, 
Without regard to clique or clan; 
I 
show the constitution with elocution, 
Bekase you know I'm a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
For oppositions or politicians, 
Take my word I 
don't give a 
damn; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
I 
control the Tombs, I 
control the Island, 
My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East river air; 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jarsey, 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's day, 
I 
march away like a 
solid man. 
For oppositions, etc.

W E 
crave your condescension, 
And we'll tell you what we know

From the seventh ward below; 
And our Captain's name was Hussey— 
A 
Tipperary man— 
He carried his sword like the Russian Duke, 
Whenever he took command. 
CHORUS . 
We shouldered guns, ' 
And marched, and marched away 
From Jackson Street 
Way up to Avenue A. 
Drums and fifes did sweetly, sweetly play, 
As we marched, marched, marched in the Mulligan Guards. 
When the band play'd Garryowen or the Connemarro pet, 
With the rub, dub, dub, we marched in the mud— 
To the military step— 
With the green above the red, boys, 
To show where we came from ; 
Our guns we'd lift, 
With the right shoulder shift, 
As we marched to the beat of the drum. 
We shouldered, etc. 
When we'd get 'Wine at night, boys, 
The divil a 
wink we'd sleep; 
We'd all set up and drink a 
sup 
Of whiskey, strong and neat. 
Then we'd all march home together 
As slippery as lard; 
The solid men would all fall in, 
And march in the Mulligan- Guard. 
We shouldered, etc.

POETICAL HASH. 
Banjo Solo. 
Sung by HARRY STAN WOOD. 
White folks, listen to me. while I 
sing to you a 
song, 
It isn't a 
very short one, nor it isn't very long. 
And whou you've heard my story, I 
haven't any doubt, 
'Twill make you melancholy when you know what it's about. 
My father was a 
carpenter, for which I 
am not to blame, 
And when I 
think of mother dear, the tears fall like the rain 
From Greenland's Icy Mountains, to the Gulf of Mexico, 
Blow you Winds of Morning, blow, blow, blow. 
AlMOSS the stormy, briny sea, along the sea-girt shore, 
Where many a 
gallant bark is lost, and the splashing waves do 
roar. 
An Indian Maiden on the Lake, she paddles her own canoe, 
With an Indian rubber overcoat,— a 
hoop do dooden doo. 
Young Henry was far out to sea, as you may understand, 
He took his pocket handkerchief and waved it in his hand. 
She gave three shrieks for Henry, and then began to cry. 
Will you walk into the garden, said the spider to the fly. 
At the foot of yonder mountain, there flows a 
limpid stream, 
'Mid the fairest of Palaces that ever yet w"as seen. 
Young Mary laid her down to rest, and loudly she did shout, 
Good morning, Mr. Jenkins, does your mother know you're out. 
With a 
Moral. 
Come all you men and maidens, wherever you may be, 
Never leave your humble cot to cross the raging sea. 
Think of the fate of Henry, who from his love did fly. 
With a 
big-a-pig—a 
little pig—a 
root— a 
hog—or die. 
HOW ARE YOU OFF FOR STAMPS P 
New by-words now are all the go, 
From ev'ryhody's mouth they now; 
You'll hear tuem in the house, or out, 
They're even in the baby's mouth; 
You'll hear them spoke by old and young, 
In fact they're told by every tongue. 
But the latest one that's out they say, 
Is " How are you off for stamps to day I" 
If you go out walking in the street, 
Some friend of yours you're sure to meet, 
nola shako your hand and at you wink, 
he'll say. ' 01(1 Friend, let's take a

You can't refuse a 
glass of beer, 
With a 
friend you've not seen foray 
You drink, and next you hear him say, 
"how are you off for stamps to-day?" 
The ladies all have beard it too, 
They never let anything pass that's new; 
And once the word is in their mouth, 
No power can stop its coming out; 
They'll shy all around with a 
smiling face, 
And put on their queenly grace; 
" 
What a 
pleasant day tor a 
ride," they'll say 
"how are you off for stamps, to-day 1" 
Now, if perchance you've got a 
wife, 
And one you love as dear as life, 
Every week you buy a 
bonnet new, 
And perhaps a 
new silk dress or two; 
To please her now, you think you've tried, 
But &till she's never satisfied. 
"I want a 
new Grecian Bend," she'll say, 
"How are you off for stamps to•day I" 
If into church you chance to stroll, 
The parson's praying for your soul; 
lie vows if you don't (10 just so, 
You'll never go up, but down below. 
Of heathens in Africa he'll speak, 
And how much money he sent last week 
As the plate goes round, you'll hear him sa

But now, kind friends. I'll say good night; 
I 
hope my song has hit you right. 
To please you all I've done my best, 
Now I'll let the subject rest;

Music by JOHN Buenix. 
The Music of this song is publiahed by G. D. RusFiEL & Co., 126 Tremont 
street, Boston, Mass. Price 40 cents. 
On, I'm the smartest Yankee girl that ever you did see, 
And though I'm from the country, I'm as cute as cute can be, 
Though but sixteen, don't think I'm green, you'll be mistaken 
there, 
Though fresh from meadows yet I 
have no hayseed in my hair. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I 
desire to particularly 
impress upon your minds, especially the gentlemen, that— 
CHORUS. 
Though but sixteen, don't think me green, you'll be mistaken 
there, 
Though fresh from meadows, yet I have no hayseed in my 
hair. 
I 
milk the cows, I 
cook, I 
churn, and thus I 
pass my life, 
And chaps that live right in the town all want me for a 
wife ; 
They've plead in vain, but every swain has found it is no go, 
Because, I 
don't mind telling you, I 
want a 
city beau. 
SPOKEN.-It may seem odd that I 
should refuse them all, 
but then you know I've a good reason ; I'm flying for higher 
game, and once more I 
beg of you to remember that— 
Though but sixteen, don't think me green, etc. 
The man I 
want must be six foot, and have a 
black mustache, 
A cluster pin, a 
diamond ring, and cut a 
military dash ; 
He must have no faults of any kind, in fact, a 
perfect brick, 
And if there's such a 
one in front, he can't apply too quick. 
SPOKEN.— I 
don't wish to be thought forward, but business is 
business—and— 
Though but sixteen, don't think me green, etc.

Composed and sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
Am.—" Out in the Street." 
IN 
Penn Yan village there once did dwell, 
A 
clerk in an ear-spoon shop ; 
lie thought he could make a 
barrel o' money 
When the cannons began to pop, 
So he bought all the bodies of played out nags 
That had suddenly come to grief, 
And went into a 
contract with Uncle Sam, 
To furnish the army with beef. 
The green-backs rolled in, and he salted them down, 
Wore fine clothes, and a 
stylish hat ; 
And he built up stores, and shops and sheds, 
And became an aristocrat. 
Then he went sparking an " upper ten " gal, 
Pretty blonde hair and teeth, 
But she wouldn't have a 
word to say to a 
man 
That was dealing in dead horse beef. 
Now, when he found out his affections was crushed 
To his butcher stalls he rushed very blue, 
And took home a 
basket of dead horse beef, 
And a 
gallon of Spauldin ,'s glue, 
And when he'd swallowed everything down he fell, 
Kicked the bucket and came to grief; 
And the coroner's jury allowed he was pizened 
By eating of Epizooty beef. 
How can you keep fish from smelling l ANSWER.-Cut their 
noses off, and they'll never smell any more. 
The man that perpetrated the above, got hit on the neck so 
hard that he was scattered all over the room, and it took a 
box 
of matches to find him. 
NEW RECIPE TO THICKEN THE HAIR. — Two ounces of molas-
ses; two ounces of glue ; two ounces of mucilage; two ounces 
of kite paste. 
Mix the ingredients together and apply the en-
tire mixture before going to bed. 
It will make the hair very 
thick. 
Perfume to taste.

BANJO SOLO— " MY DARLING MARY JANE." 
Sung by HARDY STANWOOD. 
Oh, white folks, now I'll sing a 
song. 
It's neither old nor new, 
But while I 
pick the banjo strings 
I'll vaunt it out for you. 
It's all about and just because 
I 
loved, but all in vain, 
A girl that weighed three hundred pounds, 
And her name was Mary Jane. 
CHORUS 
She was the only girl I 
ever loved, 
My darling Mary Jane. 
She run off with a 
Jersey man, 
Never to come back again. 
She was as handsome as a 
hollyhock, 
Her vanity I'll expose, 
She'd onion eyes and carrot hair, 
And such a 
turnip nose. 
She had a 
gumboil on the end, 
That looked in shape and form 
Like a 
strawberry struck by lightning 
Just after a 
thunder storm. 
She was the only girl, &c. 
Her hair it was a 
lovely red 
You could not help admire. 
When she got mad it rose right up 
Just like a 
ball of fire. 
She dressed it in the latest style, 
A waterfall it's called. 
She wore it right on the top ot her head 
To cover a 
spot that's bald. 
She was the only girl, &c. 
I 
would not care not half so much 
It my poor heart was slain. 
By any other feminine 
Except my Mary Jane. 
Oh when I 
catch that Jersey man 
I'll bounce him like a 
ball, 
I'll pin his ears to the back of his neck, 
And swallow him boots and all. 
She was the only girl, &c.

MARY'S WONDERFUL LAMB. 
By the highly educated Tutor of the Grip Sack Seminary. 
MAror possessed a 
diminutive sheep, 
Whose external covering was as devoid of odor as the con-
gealed acqueous vapor which occasionally presents insur-
mountable barriers to railroad travel on the Sierras, 
And everywhere that Mary peregrinated, 
The juvenile Southdown was certain to get up and get right 
after her. 
It tagged her to the Alphabet dispensary one day, 
Which was in contravention of established usage; 
It caused the other youthful students to cachinate and sky-
fungle 
To perceive an adolescent mutton in an edifice devoted to the 
dissemination of knowledge. 
And so the preceptor ejected him from the interior ; 
But he continued to roam in the immediate vicinity, 
And remained in the neighborhood until Mary 
Once more became visible. 
" 
What causes the juvenile sheep to hanker after Mary so I" 
Queried the inquisitive children, of their tutor. 
" 
Why, Mary bestows much affection upon the little animal 
to which the wind is tempered when shorn, you must be 
aware," 
The preceptor with alacrity, responded. 
" 
How fast they build.houses now l" said H.; " they began 
that building last week, and now they are putting in the lights." 
" 
Yes," answered his friend, " and next week they will put in 
the liver." 
TERRIBLE CASE.-Mr. Tony Hart's dog, " Bones," won't eat 
meat, raw or cooked, in any form. 
He is dead. 
W HAT time is it when a 
clock strikes thirteen ? 
ANSWER.— 
Time to get it fixed.

Ma - ry 
Jane be - gan to 
work on Tho-mas - ' s Machine. 
No sooner had I 
bought it than to work she did begin, 
And all day long I 
had to hear that horrid whirring din; 
L 
gently reprimanded her, and told my Mary Jane, 
If I 
heard that noise too often, it would surely turn my brain. 
You must know that I'm an author, and by writing make my bread. 
And to write well you want silence, and a 
cool collected head; 
- 
So as any noise disturbed me, you can understand my spleen, 
When I 
had to write and listen to the whirr of that machine. 
Cko.-0h, Mr. Thomas, &c. 
At first I 
swore a 
little swear, and then I 
swore a 
big, 
And then I 
jumped about with rage, and almost danced a 
jig; 
But it never had the least effect, she worked away like steam, 
Sometimes she'd do a 
flounce or tucker, then she'd do a 
seam. 
A 
feeling the reverse of love, almost akin to hate, 
At last came o'er me, and I 
said, my love, we'll separate; 
I'll take my books and papers to some spot calm and serene, 
Where I 
cannot be annoyed by Mr. Thomas's Machine. 
Cho.-0h, Mr. Thomas, dre. 
It's two months since I 
left her, and I 
certainly must say, 
I 
regret the cause exceedingly that made me go away; 
So mind you all take warning now, by what you've heard and seen 
And don't be over anxious for a 
Thomas's Machine. 
For if it hadn't been for that, my wife would even now 
Be residing with her husband, and we'd ue'er have bad a 
row; 
And I 
never should have purchased it, if this I 
had foreseen, 
So you see that I 
have cause to hate a 
Thomas's Machine. 
Cho.—Oh, Mr. Thomas, &c.

ORIGINAL PARODY ON. " NORA O'NEIL," 
Sung by H ANBY STANWOOD. 
Oh, I'm lonely to-night, love, without you, 
And I 
sigh for one glance of your ear. 
Oh, snre there's a 
charm, love, about you, 
You never go back on your beer, 
I 
met you out walking last Sunday, 
Deny it you can't, Miss O'Neil, 
I 
loaned you a 
nice dollar Greenback, 
To get your stockings halt soled and heeled. 
Oh I 
the nightingale sings in the kitchen, 
But it can't sing a 
good song and dance. 
I'd sooner hear your sweet voice ringing 
Down at the Beach at Long Branch. 
My father Sold charcoal on Sunday— 
The policeman be then took him in— 
My name it is Paddy McFadden 
And that's where the laugh comes in. 
Oh, Nora, sweet Nora O'Neil, 
You can't tell how sick I 
have been, 
I 
went out with Jenny McLaughlin, 
And got drunk as an owl on Benzine. 
I 
think, love, so often about you, 
But I 
dont think you love me a 
bit, 
So give me your gold watch and chain, love. 
And then I 
will get up and git. 
ASK MY MOTHER AND LET YOU SNOW. 
NEXT SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 
A pretty little girl came courting me, her name was Sarah 
Broome; 
She wanted me to marry her, and. thought I 
was a 
loon, 
She said: " I 
was a 
nice young man, and we might be well off 
soon." 
But I'll ask my mother and let you know next Sunday after. 
noon. 
CHORUS. 
The ',... indn ,!ss of this pretty little girl I 
never can forget, 
That wanted me to marry her, but I 
cannot see that yet. 
One afternoon, Miss Sarah Broome took me out for a 
walk, 
She kissed me and caressed me, and. so lovingly did talk, 
She wanted me to fly with her that night by the light of the 
moon, 
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, &c. 
She made me a 
present of a 
watch and chain, likewise a 
bran 
new hat, 
For Sundays, when I 
walked with her, that I 
might cut it fat, 
But when she found I 
would not fly with her, she wanted the 
presents hack, soon, 
But I'll ask my mother and I'll let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
Out of revenge, with one she 
They both came back for the 
to fight; 
lie said: In a 
field if he had 
But rn ask my mother and 
afternoon. 
The kindness, &c. 
knew, she ran away that night, 
watch and chain, and wanted me 
me, that he would kill me soon I 
I'll let you know next Sunday 
The kindness, &c. 
If there's any young girl, that's here to-night, would like to be 
my wife, 
Let her step forward, and I'll do the 'oc::t. 
her, through life; 
And if she's in a 
hurry, why, we might be married soon; 
But ru ask my mother and 
let you know next Sunday 
afternoon. 
The kindness, 490:).

Salt water, you know, is very wet, 
Oh, Nicodemus! 
You know you are my only pet, 
And your absence will cause me to fume and fret. 
They will feed you on salt junk 
And nasty soft-boiled peas; 
Think of this well, Nicodemus, 
Ere you cross those watery seas, 
Those windy, watery seas.— Cho. 
Of pumpkins boiled you'll get no more, 
Oh, Nicodemus! 
Convince yourself of this before, 
You can't run away, there's no back-door. 
"

The captain he will say; 
You'll have to hold on by your eye-brows, 
Or you'll be blown away 
Straight down to Botany Bay.—Cho. 
It is no use your talking io me, 
Said Nicodemus; 
For I 
intend a-going to sea, 
Out to China for Soueliong and Congo tea. 
That's a 
profitable cargo, 
In fact, you can't get better; 
Direct " Hong Kong," Australia, 
Where you send me a

You send to me a

THE RUSTIC DAMSEL. 
COMIC BANJO SONG. 
Written by W ALTER H OWARD, and sung by HARRY STANWOO D. 
A LONG time to come, I 
remember it well, 
All alone in the workhouse this beauty did dwell, 
With her father and mother she lived all serene, 
Her age it was red and her hair was nineteen. 
Now she had a 
lover, who close by did dwell, 
A 
bow-legged rustic and hump-backed as well, 
lie said, " fly with me now by the light of yon star, 
For you are the eye of my apple you are," 
But this beautiful maiden said gently, " be wise, 
My father would scratch out my nails with his eyes. 
If you love me so, you'll not 'bring me to disgrace," 
Sobbed the maiden, as she buried her hand in his face. 
So, so she refused him, he knocked down this maid, 
She suddenly opened the knife with his blade ; 
He next cut the throat of this damsel so fair, 
Then dragged her along by the head of the hair. 
Now just at this moment, the old man appears, 
And he gazed on the sight with eyes in his tears ; 
He knelt down beside her, and her cold face be kissed, 
Then rushed with his throat at the murderer's fist.

QUEER SIGHTS. 
H ARRY STANWOOD'S 1566 Banjo Song. 
I'VE come out to try and to please you, 
To-day I've been around town, 
And curious things I 
have seen then, 
I 
have noted a 
few of them down ; 
This morning I 
gobbled for breakfast 
A 
dozen nice slap-jacks you see, 
But if the slap-jacks had gobbled up me 
What a 
queer looking sight that would be'? 
Down by the market I 
wandered, 
To bear the bustle and noise, 
The folks running this way and that way, 
Such crowds of men, women and boys; 
A 
butcher was cutting a 
calf up, 
So handy he seemed for to be, 
But if the calf was cutting the butcher up 
What a 
gay looking sight it would be'? 
Next I 
went down by the depot, 
Not tired of travelling yet; 
I 
went into Gates' lager beer shop 
Some lager and pretsels to.get; 
A 
big Dutchman was eating a 
herring, 
So fat and so jolly was he, 
But if the herring was eating the Dutchman, 
What a 
queer looking sight it would be I 
Soon I 
felt somewhat hungT5-, 
It being just the hour of noon 
To get toe a 
small bit of dinner 
I 
went in an eating saloon ; 
There a 
woman was frying a 
beefsteak, 
So fat and so greasy was she, 
But if the beefsteak was frying t.!e tromin, 
What a 
hot looking sight it wolCd

BANJO SOLO—" COMING THRO' THE RYE." 
Sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
Old Mother Hubbard she went to the cupboard 
To save her poor dog's health, 
Mary said to her little lamb, 
You know how it is yourself. 
The boy that would a-wooing go 
Was in the cold ground laid. 
Oh, Johnny, I 
hardly knew you since 
You joined the free lunch Brigade. 
Champagne Charley is my name, 
While rolling home in the morn, 
Maggie sitting:by my side 
I 
tell you den I 
was gone. 
Oh put me in my little bed 
I 
just want forty winks, 
I'm lonely since my mother died 
And so is Captain Jinks. 
The forty thieves have stolen my heart, 
Musquitos stung my ear, 
The soldier leaned upon his sword 
Then wiped away a 
tear, 
On the Beach at Long Branch 
I 
walked with bonny Jean 
They were hanging frogs in Canada 
For the wearing of the green. 
Hark I 
hear an angel sing 
A-coming through the rye, 
Mother mayI go to swim 
To root hog or die. 
The spider coaxed the little fly, 
His royal nibs telt queer, 
Trying to see the new Post Office 
Then walked off on 1is ear. 
THE BUGABOO,, 
As Sung by JERRY BARRINGTON. 
COME all ye tender-hearted boys, wherever you may be, 
And I'll tell you of the dangers upon the dark blue sea, 
Of the dangers and the hardships, my boys, that I 
went 
throuab,* 
When I 
shipped as cook and steward my boys, on board of the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
The day when first I 
joined her she lay in James street canal : 
She was large and stout and beautiful—forget her shape I 
never 
shall : 
The captain wore a 
large straw hat, knee breeches and a 
body 
coat so blue,* 
Arrah, boys, he'd made a 
fine figurehead for to ornament the 
Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We soon weighed anchor and set sail to plough the raging surf, 
We were bound for the bog of Allan to get a 
load of turf. 
We sailed until we passed the back of Richmond barracks so 
true,* 
When the gallant 84th fired a 
royal salute of bricks at the cap-
tain of the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
We sailed three years when a storm arose, and the sea ran 
mountain high, 
The thunder rolled, the lightning flashed and lit the dark blue 
sky, 
So the second mate gave orders to lower the sails and clew,* 
While the captain down below was smoking in his bed—he set 
fire to the Bugaboo. 
*Repeat. 
When the captain found what he had done, he loud for help did 
shout, 
Ile called up through the chimney-top for the helmsman to 
come and put it out ; 
But the helmsman was fast asleep, and to his post untrue,* 
And the fire burned so bard through the middle of the turf, 
they couldn't save the Bugaboo. 
*Rypeat. 
When fifteen thousand miles from land in latitude fifty-four, 
The fire it burned so hard one night, that it couldn't burn any-
more; 
So the captain he gave orders to lower the boats and save the 
crew,* 
While 1,000 rods of tut f 
and 50,000 men were smothered in the 
*Rep at 
Bugaboo.

My name is McNamarra. 
I'm an American cit-i-zan; 
I'm proud you know, 
Wherever I

I'm a

There's one thing, rue boys, I'd have you know, 
And I've come to tell ye that, 
It's the seventeenth of March, 
Whin, as stiff as starch, 
I

For it's down Broadway I

The people shout whin I

And parade with my old hat. 
That hat was made in Dublin, 
In the year of ninety-eight ; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begin 
To say it's out of date. 
It's travelled the wide world over, 
From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
Is on St. Patrick's day. 
For it's down, etc. 
Thin give three cheers for the hat I 
wear, 
Before it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day, 
The day we celebrate. 
And when you see me on parade, 
I'll raise me hat to ye, 
ill invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my company. 
SHE IS A LOVE. 
Written expressly for 'Imam STANWOOD. by BOBBY Nnweomn, and sung 
by him with great success. 
A LITTLE Sono' I now vill sing, 
About a 
girl so fair, 
That I 
met walking out one day, 
She had such lovely hair ; 
She said she was an English blonde, 
Imported just, was she, 
And said, I 
was the style to suit. 
She'd fell in love with me. 
cnottus. 
My little love she is a 
dove, 
Just like an angel from above; 
The sweetest little charmer I 
ever did see, 
She don't love anybody else but me. 
She said she'd like to have ice cream, 
We walked in a 
saloon ; 
The waiter brought the frozen food, 
Which disappeared quite soon, 
When all at once she said to me, 
" 
It tastes quite cowey, truly," 
I 
said, `• Oh, no, it is not so, 
To me it does taste bully." 
My little love, etc. 
Now she had almond finger nails, 
Her eyes your heart they'd melt; 
As a 
pea-nut eater I 
am sure, 
My girl she'd wear the belt; 
And when I'd take her to a 
ball, 
Her feet the floor would hide ; 
So all the dancers that was there, 
Would have to stand outside. 
My little love, etc. 
She used to have the Grecian Bend, 
To make both ends meet she'd try ; 
And when she'd twist her head to (lance, 
She'd make the shoe pens fly. 
Her hand was soft just like bread, 
Her mouth curled to her ear ; 
Her back was crooked, 
Her waist looked like a 
ke-r of beer. 
Mv iitt:e lov;,, 
etc. 
Sung by HARRY STAN WOOD. 
Oh white folks listen to my song, 
To these in y 
little rhymes ; 
It's all about thInLs as they are, 
in these here troublesome times. 
But nothing worries me at all, 
And that you all must know ; 
I 
spend iny time in Singing, 
While I 
pick on the old Banjo. 
CHORUS. 
Happy Nigger Joseph is my name. 
Happy Nigger Joseph is my autograph. 
Did you ever see the Devil with his big wcoden shovel 
Digging up spuds with his night cap on. 
Happy Nigger Joseph is my signature. 
Happy Nigger Joseph is my cbgnomen. 
High di•Idle diddle, the cat's in the fiddle, 
And the cow jumped over the moon. 
I 
feel in love with a 
nice young girl. 
Johanna was her name ; 
She was a 
bully littie girl with a 
big glass eye, 
And she walked a 
little lame. 
I 
whispered love in her wax. ear, 
Bought her oysters by the keg ; 
And besides an awful Grecian Bend, 
She wore a 
wooden foot. 
CHORUS. 
Happy Nigger Joseph is my name. 
Happy Nigger Joseph's got enough. 
Ding dong gilly on your own benzine, 
To meet Johnny Booker at the Bowling Green, 
Steady in your long tailed blue. 
When the swallows homeward flew. 
When my days' work's done I 
have my fun, 
With the wickedest man in New York. 
Now this young girl was just sixteen, 
As gentle as a 
camel •, 
With eyes as Llack as driven snow. 
And a 
mouth like the Jersey 'funnel. 
She looked so gay and dressed so neat, 
While walking down the street, 
With Bismark shoes its large as mine, 
Oh wasn't she a 
healthy dead beat. 
CHORUS. 
Happy Nigger Joseph is my name, 
I'm well sApplied, you bet 
There's a 
rose in the garden for you, young man, 
I 
can't hold the plow but r11 do the best I 
can. 
Don't you go. Tommy, don't you go, 
Stay at home, Tommy, don't you go. 
The steeple in the clock has just struck one, 
Oh, Kaiser, doll t 
you want to lmy a 
dog. 
SQUINTY DAN, 
LBANJO SOL0.1 
11.1 tell you of a 
nice young man, 
And of a 
maiden gal; 
The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she long-legged Sal. 
They fixed down on Centre Street, 
And loved each other well ; 
And it's of a 
dismal history, 
That now I'm going to tell. 
Now Squinty Dan he had red hair, 
And looked two ways for Monday; 
He peddled clams around the street, 
On every day but Sunday. 
But Sundays Squinty Dan would go 
To court long-legged Sal, 
And take her to ride in his clam-barouche 
On the banks of Gowanus canal. 
He used to feed her on clam-soup, 
Clam-chowder, and clam-pie, 
And send her lots of long- necked clams, 
For her to roast and fry. 
Till the neighbors' gals, through jealousy, 
Male up a 
horrid plan 
To freeze the love in the bosom of 
Her darling Squinty Dan, 
When Squity Dan heard the news, 
He climbed to a 
chimney-top ; 
He pulled a 
pound of powder out, 
And down he let it drop. 
It flashed up with a 
fearful roar, 
And blowed him so far on high ; 
He never came down—and that is the last 
Of this mournful his-to-ry.

HARRY STANWOOD'S LATEST SQUIBS. 
W HY does a 
little dog turn around twice before he sits down 
once ? 
ANSWER.—Because one good turn deserves another. 
STANWOOD knows a 
man who works at his trade ( moulder in 
a 
feather foundry), in Grafton, Canada, who is so mean that he 
stole the wool off a 
lost lamb in January. 
ANTHONY SHREWSBURY of Valejo, (California), is so thin he 
can dive down into soda water bottles and bring up the corks 
that get pushed in 
lie has got a 
brother whose legs are so 
thin they look like number 11 on a 
door. 
THERE is a boy in Boston with a glass eye, and when he 
plays marbles, he takes out the eye and uses it for a 
glass alley. 
A PIANOFORTE teacher in Fredonia, N. Y., can finger the keys 
quicker than a 
cockroach can get over a 
second class bar. Hon-
est. 
WHY is a 
man who marries a 
hotel keeper's daughter, like a 
captain who has a 
barrel of soft-soap on his ship 7 Axswca.— 
Because he has got a 
soft thing on board. 
STAN WOOD knows a 
lazy fellow who objects to hold 10 pounds 
of Berlin wool for his sister to wind, but goes next door and 
holds 125 pounds of Farmer Acorn's daughter, and never makes 
a 
kick.

If I'm not mistaken ' twas Charles H. Day.

WEBSTER'S BUSINESS MAN 
treats upon every topic incidental 
te the experience of a 
business man. 
While its main design is to instruct the 
reader in the details of commercial correspondence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader. 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank-
ers and their dealers, inasmuch as hundreds of thousands a persons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body of the work has been appended:-
1. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mer-
cantile men at home and abroad, as a 
peculiar and distinetive language not 
familiar to the general reaoier. 
2. A table of moneys in which mercantile accounts are kept in various 
foreign countries, information all important to dealers in imported merchan-
dise: and 
3. several forms of important documents not to be found in a 
majority of 
tvorks upon book-keeping. 
This work has been submitted to the perusal of several of our most eminent 
bankers and traders, and has invariably met with their approval.
