SPEAKERS
Bart Mizee, Terry Mizee, Jared Schmidt, Kurt Mizee
Jared Schmidt 00:00
You were explaining your family background.
Bart Mizee 00:03
Yes. So I was born in 1949.
Jared Schmidt 00:09
Okay.
Bart Mizee 00:09
And I have three siblings. Two were born in Holland, and the younger one was, was born here in
the States as well. My parents came after five years of war occupation, living in the
Netherlands.
Jared Schmidt 00:32
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 00:34
Sponsorship was required at the time and an individual in California sponsored them coming to
the states here. And part of that was an obligation to work a timeframe for them.
B
B
B
Â© 
Jared Schmidt 00:50
Mkay.
Bart Mizee 00:51
And when that expired, they decided, or had, that California wasn't the place they, they wanted
to live. And so, they came north. I'm not sure, exactly, if there were connections, or if they just
heard about others who had come from the Netherlands who lived in the general area here.
Jared Schmidt 01:00
Mhm. Okay.
Kurt Mizee 01:19
The sponsor was actually a dairy farmer.
Bart Mizee 01:19
In... Yes, that's correct.
Jared Schmidt 01:23
Okay. So, then, were they dairy farmers then, in Holland, or?
Bart Mizee 01:26
No. Actually, my dad was a manager of rural estate and he managed the second largest estate
in the country.
Jared Schmidt 01:36
Okay.
Bart Mizee 01:37
And, part of the reason for their going was, was that he had not much chance of rising above
that.
B
K
B
B
B
Jared Schmidt 01:47
Okay.
Bart Mizee 01:47
And, and he had interest to see other parts of the world.
Jared Schmidt 01:53
Mkay, so they moved from, you said, California up here, then, and...
Kurt Mizee 01:56
They did.
Jared Schmidt 01:57
Okay, was sponsored by dairy farmer, right?
Kurt Mizee 01:59
In California.
Jared Schmidt 02:00
In California, okay.
Bart Mizee 02:00
In California. Yes, yes.
Jared Schmidt 02:02
Where, I heard they had the happy cows down in California.
Bart Mizee 02:05
[Slightly mischevously] Well...[All three laugh]
B
K
K
B
B
Jared Schmidt 02:08
Careful what you say on the record about that one? So then, when did they settle up in
Tillamook?
Bart Mizee 02:14
Actually, lived in Forest Grove [Oregon]
Jared Schmidt 02:19
Okay!
Bart Mizee 02:20
for a few years. And he worked for Carlton Nursery for a time and they owned a piece of
property, where they raised rhododendrons and azaleas in particular.
Jared Schmidt 02:33
Okay.
Bart Mizee 02:35
And, uh...
Kurt Mizee 02:36
In Netarts [Oregon].
Jared Schmidt 02:37
Oh, Okay.
Kurt Mizee 02:38
Which is where I live now.
Jared Schmidt 02:39
Okay, great. Okay. Yeah. Well, my, my girlfriend's family is from Forest Grove. So, you say
B
B
B
K
K
Okay, great. Okay. Yeah. Well, my, my girlfriend's family is from Forest Grove. So, you say
that...
Bart Mizee 02:44
Oh really?
Jared Schmidt 02:45
Yeah. The Jansen family.
Bart Mizee 02:48
Well, I'd have to get some help to recall. But...
Jared Schmidt 02:51
Right, right, right. It's all good.
Bart Mizee 02:54
Anyway, so they had the opportunity to purchase that, that piece of land there between Netarts
and Oceanside [Oregon].
Jared Schmidt 03:05
Okay.
Bart Mizee 03:06
And he took over for some, some work at Diamond, I think was plywood already at that time.
Jared Schmidt 03:20
Okay.
Bart Mizee 03:21
And, and worked there for a number of years. And, I don't remember exactly enough of those
particulars, but at any rate, decided to, to go on his own, then.
B
B
B
B
B
Jared Schmidt 03:39
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 03:40
And time. And, so, yeah, like Kurt, mentioned, presently, he is living on that piece of property.
Jared Schmidt 03:53
Okay. That they originally...?
Bart Mizee 03:56
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 03:56
Okay.
Bart Mizee 03:56
Yeah. And yeah, when, when, when they would come over, at that time frame, coming from
Forest Grove to Tillamook, here, this was a short time after the Tillamook Burn. And I still have
recollection of the, those trees that were burned
Jared Schmidt 04:16
Okay.
Bart Mizee 04:16
and burned down and it looks totally different than than today.
Jared Schmidt 04:21
When was the burn? I don't, I'm not familiar with this.
Kurt Mizee 04:24
B
B
B
B
K
Kurt Mizee 04:24
1930s? 1936, maybe was the first one?
Bart Mizee 04:28
Maybe the first one yeah, this was, this time again was that was early '50s.
Jared Schmidt 04:33
Okay.
Bart Mizee 04:33
That we were traveling through there so there was yeah.
Jared Schmidt 04:35
Okay.
Bart Mizee 04:35
There was...
Kurt Mizee 04:38
Maybe you want to take a break for a minute because she's got leave actually in just a few, so
if you want to get...
Jared Schmidt 04:42
Okay, yeah! So then Terry, so, are you originally from a dairy farming family as well? Or did you
marry into one?
Terry Mizee 04:49
This is it.
Jared Schmidt 04:49
This is it! [All four laugh] Are you from originally, then, or?
K
B
B
B
K
T
Terry Mizee 04:54
Yeah, I was born in the house up the road.
Jared Schmidt 04:56
Oh, okay, that's what your...Kurt pointed out the house up the road you're born in. Yes.
Kurt Mizee 04:59
Yes. Oh, yeah and, and Grandma.
Terry Mizee 05:03
And grandma, yes, yes.
Jared Schmidt 05:05
Yes. Okay, great. So you, this is always, you've always been with the farming, the dairy
farming?
Terry Mizee 05:10
So this was a separate farm. The end of the road up to the house that my folks live in was a
separate farm. So this was three different farms. When I, when I was a child this was a farm, a
separate farm. This house belong to, and there was a barn down here.
Jared Schmidt 05:18
All of this was smaller farms?
Terry Mizee 05:18
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 05:18
Mkay.
T
K
T
T
T
Kurt Mizee 05:30
Okay.
Terry Mizee 05:31
There were three barns on this road and three houses. Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 05:33
Really?
Terry Mizee 05:33
Yeah. So, one at the end of the road, one where they are, and then this house, and the farms
below it.
Jared Schmidt 05:39
Okay. And then your family bought...
Terry Mizee 05:41
Bought them.
Jared Schmidt 05:41
Bought them out, or...?
Terry Mizee 05:43
Yes, yes.
Jared Schmidt 05:43
Okay.
Terry Mizee 05:44
Yeah.
K
T
T
T
T
T
Jared Schmidt 05:44
So then did you grow up milking cows as well, then, or?
Terry Mizee 05:46
Absolutely.
Jared Schmidt 05:47
Absolutely.
Terry Mizee 05:47
Feeding calves, milking cows. I was just telling Bart, before you came down here, I said, "Yeah. I
would ride my bike down here and through the cow trails to, to get the cows now they come
down on the four wheelers." [A four wheeler drives by, all four laugh]
Jared Schmidt 06:02
Case in point as one drives by!
Terry Mizee 06:04
Case in point!
Jared Schmidt 06:05
Right on, and yeah, there you go!
Terry Mizee 06:07
So, so yeah, we, my sister and I, both milked cows.
Jared Schmidt 06:16
Mkay.
Terry Mizee 06:16
T
T
T
T
T
Terry Mizee 06:16
Fed cows.
Kurt Mizee 06:17
Before and after school.
Terry Mizee 06:18
Before and after school. Fed um, or, made hay, bucked bales, drove tractor.
Jared Schmidt 06:25
You did it all?
Terry Mizee 06:26
We did it all.
Jared Schmidt 06:27
Okay, so how many had a cow do you remember you had at that time?
Terry Mizee 06:30
Maybe only 60?
Jared Schmidt 06:33
Okay, compared to, what was it, you have 180, or?
Kurt Mizee 06:35
180, and we've been as high as 260. So...
Jared Schmidt 06:39
Okay, how was that? What's it like to watch the transition as the your farms have expanded? As
you've seen the incorporation of technology? Like, Kurt showed me the milker robot. I'm just
imagining, like, now you saying you had to wake up early and milk by hand versus this carwash
T
K
T
T
T
K
looking thing.
Terry Mizee 06:58
We never actually milked by hand because my dad was very progressive in the dairy business.
We had the first milking parlor we, you know. We, we've always been a little jump ahead of
everybody else, which Kirk continues to do. [Laughs] But, but yes, we definitely we did the
milking in the morning. And with that few cows, you didn't have to do it as early.
Jared Schmidt 07:07
Oh really? Okay.
Terry Mizee 07:25
I remember the milk going into the milk cans.
Jared Schmidt 07:30
Mhm.
Terry Mizee 07:30
And the milk cans being put into a cement cooler, with cold water in it, and loading those,
putting them on, in the picku, and taking them down to the Creamery, and unloading them
onto a conveyor belt that took them in. [Jared laughs] Dumped them, brought them back
around, and he loaded them up again [Laughs].
Jared Schmidt 07:47
In the Tillamook Creamy, or?
Terry Mizee 07:48
Yes, yes.
Jared Schmidt 07:49
Okay, this is before the consolidation of them all, right, or around that same time?
T
T
T
T
Bart Mizee 07:53
Yes, yes, it was before that.
Jared Schmidt 07:55
Okay, I heard all, I've heard all the stories of the consolidation efforts.
Terry Mizee 07:58
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 07:59
Okay. That's cool. So this is all very much a part of who your, your life and your identity then,
or?
Terry Mizee 08:04
Yes. And my dad actually drove a truck, milk truck, for the Creamery, and my mom did a good
deal of the milking that we didn't do. So, that was all part of...It was very much a family farm
then, with, I believe we had one employee.
Jared Schmidt 08:23
Mhm.
Terry Mizee 08:25
And, as, as it got bigger and the technology advanced, for me, it became a little less of a family
farm. I don't feel the need to to help out these guys have got it covered. [All laugh] Thank
goodness.
Jared Schmidt 08:39
Yeah, right?
Terry Mizee 08:41
Yeah. So yeah.
B
T
T
T
T
Kurt Mizee 08:47
[To Terry as she leaves] You have to run. I might still be here by the time you're done.
Bart Mizee 08:52
She she, since that period, though, has been an entrepreneur with, with a friend.
Jared Schmidt 09:01
Mkay.
Bart Mizee 09:01
And ran a tea shop for, what? 12 years.
Jared Schmidt 09:06
Okay, that explains why you have all the
Bart Mizee 09:07
16.
Terry Mizee 09:07
16.
Jared Schmidt 09:08
You've had all the tea cups out there. I saw when I walked in.
Terry Mizee 09:10
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 09:11
I was quite impressed by your collection!
K
B
B
B
T
T
Terry Mizee 09:12
[Laughs] We had La-Tea-Da Tea Room and Gift Shop.
Jared Schmidt 09:15
Oh, that was, okay! That was yours tea shop. Okay. Yeah. [The store closed recently]
Terry Mizee 09:18
Not for the last three years. It was sold and, but for 16 years we had it.
Jared Schmidt 09:20
Okay. Okay. I assume there was always fresh cream on the tables for the coffee?
Terry Mizee 09:27
Sure. [Jared laughs] Not raw, fresh. [Terry laughs]
Jared Schmidt 09:32
Yes. Yeah. Not out of the little container, things. Fresh from the creamery, right?
Terry Mizee 09:36
Yeah.
Bart Mizee 09:36
Yeah.
Terry Mizee 09:37
I won't be gone too long. [Leaves]
Jared Schmidt 09:38
Sounds good! So this is originally her farm, then, is that?
T
T
T
T
B
T
Bart Mizee 09:43
Yes, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 09:43
Okay, so then you, did you go to school, you born in the States, you said. How did that all, how
did you ultimately end up on this farm, then?
Bart Mizee 10:00
How much do I include there? I started off school down in, in Southern Oregon.
Jared Schmidt 10:11
Okay.
Bart Mizee 10:12
And, uhh, that was a period of the Vietnam War.
Jared Schmidt 10:23
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 10:24
And, in the overall, it came to a point of a lottery and set it at 200. And the friend of mine that I
was working with...Well, actually, at first, after high school, I went to barber school, worked my
way through college.
Jared Schmidt 10:34
Mhm. Oh, cool. Mhm.
Bart Mizee 10:47
So, anyway, I was living with, with him. And, anyway, he was just under the number and I was
just above the 200.
B
B
B
B
B
Jared Schmidt 10:55
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 10:56
And, so, anyway, I ended up then, after a year of school at Salk, and then in Portland moving to
Utah. Utah State has a dairy program.
Jared Schmidt 11:16
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 11:16
And that's where I got my training, basically, down there. And then after that, we moved back
to the farm here. About '75.
Jared Schmidt 11:24
Okay, was that when you met Terry them?
Bart Mizee 11:27
No, actually. I remember her still. When we were young, I can't remember how long, but,
anyway, riding the school bus, at least on the way home together, not not the morning. But I
can still picture my mind, clearly, she and her sister climbing with their lunch buckets, onto the
bus and stuff. And, and, and then, actually, it was her freshman year of high school. The first
gathering of students, it was a dance, or, anyway, a get together time and that's when we first
connected it. And at an older age, then.
Jared Schmidt 12:12
Nice.
Bart Mizee 12:13
Yeah, we've been together since.
Jared Schmidt 12:14
Then ever since there's been. Yeah, good. And then and that's what you have. when did you
B
B
B
B
Then ever since there's been. Yeah, good. And then and that's what you have. when did you
have Kurt, then?
Bart Mizee 12:21
After we came back from Utah. His older brother was born down there.
Jared Schmidt 12:26
Okay. Then what year were you born, Kurt?
Kurt Mizee 12:30
1977.
Jared Schmidt 12:31
Mkay. And then you grew up here, or were born raised here then, as well, or?
Kurt Mizee 12:34
Born in the Tillamook hospital.
Jared Schmidt 12:36
Okay!
Kurt Mizee 12:36
Lived here, other than two years at community college and two years at university. So...
Jared Schmidt 12:41
Where do you go to community college?
Kurt Mizee 12:43
Linn Benton Community College [Albany, Oregon].
Jared Schmidt 12:44
B
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 12:44
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 12:44
And then Oregon State University [Corvallis, Oregon].
Jared Schmidt 12:47
Mkay. What did you study?
Kurt Mizee 12:47
I, my girlfriend, at the time that I was engaged to, was finishing up and I figured out I could
wrap it up that year with a general agriculture degree and head back to the farm and get
started on life. So, anyway, so yeah, then, then came back to the farm in '99. I spent the first
three-and-a-half years studying animal science and then move to general agriculture degree.
Jared Schmidt 13:18
Back to this farm?
Kurt Mizee 13:19
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 13:20
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 13:20
And, and moved on to the place that my dad's folks had, between Netarts and Oceanside.
Jared Schmidt 13:30
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 13:31
So, pretty, pretty fortunate to have a place like that to move back to after, after getting out of
K
K
K
K
K
So, pretty, pretty fortunate to have a place like that to move back to after, after getting out of
school and...
Jared Schmidt 13:39
Yeah!
Kurt Mizee 13:39
Remodeled the house that my grandfather, and, and my dad and uncle largely built. I mean,
they built it all, but...
Jared Schmidt 13:48
Really?
Kurt Mizee 13:49
From pouring the blocks by hand, to building the walls that have planar ends from the mill that
he worked at.
Jared Schmidt 13:55
That's cool.
Kurt Mizee 13:57
So, yeah, it's neat, neat to have history both there and, and here at the farm, so.
Jared Schmidt 14:01
It seems like that's very much a trend, or, a very shared idea of this, this historical, this farm
has been held for your family for generations. These houses have been held for your family for
generations, that seems very
Kurt Mizee 14:14
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 14:14
much because it, also...When I was driving in I saw a sign that said a century farm, right?
K
K
K
K
much because it, also...When I was driving in I saw a sign that said a century farm, right?
Kurt Mizee 14:18
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 14:18
So this is is a century farm, right?
Kurt Mizee 14:20
Right. Since 1918, our family has farmed his ground.
Jared Schmidt 14:23
Okay. Could you explain a little bit more of what is a century farm? What's that mean to you to
work a century farm?
Kurt Mizee 14:29
Yeah, I mean, essentially, I mean, a century form, you know, as you'd guess, once you hit 100
year mark, then, you know, the governor basically says congratulations, and you get a sign,
and they shake your hand.
Jared Schmidt 14:42
That's really cool!
Bart Mizee 14:43
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 14:43
It's, it's, I mean, it's something that, I can remember in high school, thinking, "Man, by the time
we hit the century mark, I'm gonna be old."[All three laugh] Most days...
Jared Schmidt 14:53
And here you are? [All three laugh]
K
K
K
B
K
And here you are? [All three laugh]
Kurt Mizee 14:55
I don't feel old. But, you know, I, my wife took a video the other day and I was like, "Have I had
that much gray hair for a while, or?" you know, so...Anyway, but for us, I mean, what it means,
here is, for me, I recognize that the success that I have, or that I'm able to capture here, is in
large part because of sacrifices, and investments, and those sorts of things made by previous
generations.
Jared Schmidt 15:26
Right.
Kurt Mizee 15:27
So, A, you can't take a lot of credit for things going well.
Jared Schmidt 15:34
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 15:36
Certainly, you can contribute to it. But that contribution, then, is for the future. Not, and so
every management decision is based off of, how do you proceed in a way that is long term, not
immediate?
Jared Schmidt 15:37
Mhm. Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 15:50
So, and, and even in transitioning between generations. So, you know, really, Dad and I are the
first father-son to work together on this farm, because it's been an in-law basis, right?
Jared Schmidt 16:04
With the Mizee family, right?
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 16:06
Well, so Josie, Josie to Fink to Mizee, so...And, and I think there's a different dynamic, there.
Jared Schmidt 16:16
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 16:16
You know, when you're, when you're working with your in-law versus what you've grown up
with your whole life. Som and then maybe that served us well. I mean, it's, it's rare to see any
business go four generations, really.
Jared Schmidt 16:29
Yeah!
Kurt Mizee 16:31
So, I think there's been some strength in that, but, I mean, that's sort of my take on it. I don't...
Bart Mizee 16:37
No, I concur with, with a lot of that. To have the good fortune to have family, you know, of her,
her folks caliber and, and stuff and...Oh, my father-in-law, he's a [Pounds table, chuckles] pretty
special guy.
Jared Schmidt 17:06
Yeah.
Bart Mizee 17:07
He's still, still alive living up there.
Jared Schmidt 17:09
Oh really?
Bart Mizee 17:10
K
K
K
B
B
B
Bart Mizee 17:10
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 17:10
That's cool.
Bart Mizee 17:11
The both of them.
Kurt Mizee 17:12
Mows of the grass around the farm and really comes out to figure out what we're up to next.
Jared Schmidt 17:17
Check in and tell you what you're doing little wrong, or?
Bart Mizee 17:19
No.
Jared Schmidt 17:20
Okay.
Bart Mizee 17:21
Just for interest in to see what's, what's going on.
Jared Schmidt 17:23
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 17:24
Only, and very, I mean, generation to generation has been very supportive
B
B
K
B
B
K
Jared Schmidt 17:28
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 17:28
of what the next generation wants to do.
Jared Schmidt 17:30
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 17:32
When we put the milking robots in, he was shaking his head a little bit. And after watching the
first couple of milkings, especially on a just new heifer that had never seen the machine before.
He was, he was handing out brochures to the guys at the coffee shop. [Kurt and Jared laugh]
Jared Schmidt 17:37
Brochures of like, "This is what we need to do now"?
Kurt Mizee 17:51
No, like, this, you gotta see this, like, this is amazing. And so...
Jared Schmidt 17:55
That's cool. Yeah, Terry was saying her father was, there, was always very more progressive in,
in the farming. That's the Fink? Is that last name?
Bart Mizee 18:02
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 18:02
That's the road that we're on?
Bart Mizee 18:03
K
K
K
B
B
Yes, that's correct.
Jared Schmidt 18:04
Oh! I pieced that together [All three laugh]. I was like, "Hold on a second! They named the
road..." Okay. Cool. And so they're were always progressive and that's something you kind of
picked up on and passed on, or?
Bart Mizee 18:13
Well, tried. But, like I said, he was a hard act to follow.
Jared Schmidt 18:15
Yeah. [Laughs]
Bart Mizee 18:20
Yeah, 'cuz he, the variety of stuff that he's been involved with over the years is, is amazing.
Jared Schmidt 18:27
Yeah.
Bart Mizee 18:28
He could talk for days and, and give you information. But, yeah, it's, it's, it's been, it's been
definitely a pleasure and a benefit to, to have that kind of a scenario to, to work with.
Jared Schmidt 18:48
The have the three generations.
Bart Mizee 18:49
Mhm.
Jared Schmidt 18:49
That's really cool. I didn't know there so many generations of your family. Is that something
that's, not, is that common or atypical for this region to have that sort of, like, familial passing
B
B
B
B
that's, not, is that common or atypical for this region to have that sort of, like, familial passing
on?
Kurt Mizee 19:04
There's, there's a fair bit. As, as dairy farming has gotten, you know, less and less financially
viable.
Jared Schmidt 19:14
Right.
Kurt Mizee 19:15
And the same or more amount of work, younger generations aren't quite as ready to jump on
the bandwagon, I don't think. But, here, there's, there's been a long history of family farms
being passed along, most of those are of Swiss descent, which is what the Fink and Josie side
are. So, I'm half-Swiss, half-Dutch.
Jared Schmidt 19:39
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 19:42
But we're, we're moving away from that a little bit. There are, there is a pretty good group of
younger farmers right now. So that's encouraging to see. But yeah, I mean, I think that's, that's
the goal, and really, to get in to farming, anymore, unless you've got family doing it's almost
impossible
Jared Schmidt 20:03
With the cost of land and
Kurt Mizee 20:05
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 20:06
equipment, and...
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 20:06
Just access to it.
Jared Schmidt 20:07
Right.
Kurt Mizee 20:07
And, and now, competition against corporate buyers and those sorts of things.
Jared Schmidt 20:12
Yeah, yeah we're seeing that back in rural Minnesota of conglomerates, just consuming and
consuming.
Kurt Mizee 20:18
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 20:18
Well, speaking of that, how many acres is your, your, your century farm? How many? Or how
big is it? You were explaining some of the rivers and that we're on an island an. I'm sorry, I
can't get over that idea of being on an island, yet [Kurt and Bart laugh] Maybe it's because I'm
from the prairie. I'm not used to islands. Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 20:33
So, this farm is, is about 125 acres. About five of that is, is just buildings to house the animals
and that sort of thing. We are six feet above sea level, [Jared laughs] we have a Army Corps of
Engineers certified 50 year levee around us and two other farms. So, we're at the, the edge of
where the Trask and Tillamook Rivers come together and meet the Tillamook Bay.
Jared Schmidt 21:03
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 21:05
So, at this farm, we're pretty much exclusively grass. And where we make grass silage, feed for
K
K
K
K
K
So, at this farm, we're pretty much exclusively grass. And where we make grass silage, feed for
the cows out of that or graze. You know, just kind of depends on what's available for feed that
year. So...
Jared Schmidt 21:23
Right.
Kurt Mizee 21:24
But, we've been, we've never not grazed the cows here since 1918. So, we're doing that. We
also have another smaller farm across town with a barn where we have some young stock and
then we mostly raise feed there for the cows here.
Jared Schmidt 21:38
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 21:39
So, that's as far as the size of the operation. There's about 300, 350, depending on when it is,
animals total.
Jared Schmidt 21:53
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 21:54
180 cows milking. But we do export the calves from six months of age until close to calving.
Jared Schmidt 22:05
Mhm. Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 22:06
They go across the state and are raised by a custom grower over there. So... But otherwise, we
take care of everything here, so.
Jared Schmidt 22:14
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 22:14
Mkay. How many cows did you [Bart] have when you started the farm then? Because he's at
180, and now, what was it, been exponentially growing, or?
Bart Mizee 22:21
[Pondering]
Kurt Mizee 22:34
While he's trying to remember, I can tell you that when I came back from college, we were at
180. And we we
Bart Mizee 22:39
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 22:39
Pretty steadily grew that to about 260.
Jared Schmidt 22:41
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 22:42
And then about 10 years ago, when we decided to make the switch to robots, and, and move it
back to more family operation, or at least something that family could basically take care of.
Jared Schmidt 22:53
Right.
Kurt Mizee 22:54
We decided to go back to that 180 count number, so. Okay, so you downsized a bit.
Bart Mizee 22:59
I wanted to say around 120.
B
K
B
K
K
K
B
I wanted to say around 120.
Jared Schmidt 23:01
Mkay. About when you were...? Mkay. Mkay, that's cool. Yeah, just because I was asking you
[Kurt] earlier, when we're out there on the farm, or the barns, you know, what is the size of the
farm? Or, you know, how many head of cattle is average, or typical, for Tillamook, is it, it's
about middle, I think you said, or?
Bart Mizee 23:04
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 23:22
Yeah, middle to getting to be kind of the lower end at this point. So I would say that probably
closer to 300 is probably at a more mid sized dairy in Tillamook now. And there's some
extremes. There are some that are, you know, in the 50 count range, and there's some that are
way over that, so.
Jared Schmidt 23:38
Mkay. Why is that? Are we seeing the, just more pressure for more milk is needed across for
the creamery or for the country? Or
Kurt Mizee 23:45
yeah, I mean, it's largely just based on their some economies of scale and people trying to
provide for that generation wants to come home and you just, you have to have more flow.
Jared Schmidt 23:53
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 23:53
And, really the, the milk price that we're paid right now hasn't really changed much since dad
took over.
Jared Schmidt 23:59
Okay.
B
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 23:59
So, you know, those efficiencies are the only way to really survive. I mean, obviously, if that
price has stayed the same, and fuel and every other input has gone up dramatically.
Jared Schmidt 24:10
Mhm, yeah.
Kurt Mizee 24:12
That, that makes the numbers tougher to crunch.
Jared Schmidt 24:14
Right, yeah. Mkay. That's interesting. Mkay. And then, um, you said when you brought back to
the, the robots, I'm really curious about that. Was that your idea of putting in the robot was
your that was? [Bart points at Kurt] You point! [All three laugh] You point the blame at Kurt!
[Jared laughs]
Bart Mizee 24:33
Well, it was familiar.
Jared Schmidt 24:35
Okay. What did you pick about all that?
Bart Mizee 24:40
I'm not sure, in the beginning, exactly. Again, amazing.
Jared Schmidt 24:46
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 24:47
But, yeah, we didn't. We didn't have anything much to go by.
K
K
B
B
B
Jared Schmidt 24:54
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 24:55
Because we were the first ones in the area.
Jared Schmidt 25:00
To do that?
Bart Mizee 25:00
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 25:01
In the Western US.
Jared Schmidt 25:02
Oh, really?
Kurt Mizee 25:03
Yeah. The next closest robots were east of the Mississippi, so.
Jared Schmidt 25:06
You guys are trailblazers. No, no pun intended on the basketball team, there.
Kurt Mizee 25:09
Or a glutton for punishment. [All three laugh]
Jared Schmidt 25:11
Why do you, why do you say a glutton for punishment?
B
B
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 25:13
Well, so, the robots, actually, that we have, now, the model, we couldn't even see it because it
hadn't, hadn't started producing it yet.
Jared Schmidt 25:22
Ooh.
Kurt Mizee 25:22
So, it was a brand new model. So we have the first two we put in we're number six and seven in
the entire United States.
Jared Schmidt 25:27
Wow!
Kurt Mizee 25:28
So, but it was clearly a better model. We ended up doing a lot of r&d for the company,
basically, for the first two years [Jared and Kurt laugh].
Jared Schmidt 25:38
You were the guinea pigs?
Kurt Mizee 25:39
That was a little, painful, so. [Jared laughs] But, so, I guess a little backstory, here. So we had
been looking at robots, and it looked like something that was viable to milk the cows, you
know, consistently and do it in a quality manner. And I was at a show in California to meet with
one of the vendors. And, while I was down there, my wife and daughter were killed in a car
accident.
Jared Schmidt 26:13
Oh. I'm really sorry, Kurt.
Kurt Mizee 26:14
K
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 26:14
And so, this is my high school sweetheart. And we had been together for 13 years at that point.
Well, married for 13 years, together for 20.
Jared Schmidt 26:23
I'm sorry.
Kurt Mizee 26:25
So, then it was a, it was a matter of if I was going to remain a dairy farmer and raise my son,
who was five at the time, how do we make that happen? And so, this was the direction we
headed in. And really, so the accident was in February, in April, we went to Canada and toured
robots. In June, we signed the contract. And by December, we were milking.
Jared Schmidt 26:50
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 26:52
And it was a, you know, we, failure is not an option scenario.
Jared Schmidt 26:57
Rght.
Kurt Mizee 26:58
Because this was how we were going to move our four generation farm forward. In, in light of
that tragedy, so. Anyway, so that's, we, we took it on with maybe a different attitude than most
and, and, and it's, it's been, I don't think, at this point, we would do it any other way.
Jared Schmidt 27:25
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 27:26
In terms of what it's done for quality of life. And for the the cows themselves, so.
K
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 27:31
Quality of life for you, for you all and for the cows.
Kurt Mizee 27:33
Yeah, both.
Jared Schmidt 27:34
Okay. Because you were saying earlier, before the robots, it was up at three o'clock in the
morning, and now you're like, "I can get up at seven or something."
Kurt Mizee 27:40
Yeah. And I mean, when the kids were younger, I, you know, so I, I remarried almost eight years
ago. And, and my wife had two teenage daughters. And so, I would actually take the kids to
school in the morning, and then come, and that's, you know, that's sort of unheard of in the
dairy world.
Jared Schmidt 27:59
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 27:59
So.
Jared Schmidt 28:00
Yeah, you mentioned that. I was very surprised to hear that, because that's all stories I,
growing up with kids who also were dairy farmers. That's, well, you're actually able to play
sports? [Jared and Bart laugh]
Kurt Mizee 28:12
Yeah, and so that was, a, you know, that's, that doesn't take all the work away and, and I've
actually elevates the level of management that's required.
Jared Schmidt 28:20
Mhm.
K
K
K
K
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 28:21
But it gives you a flexibility that you don't have otherwise. So if you're in the middle of making
feed or there is a soccer game or volleyball game, you know, you can actually still have a life. I
mean, you know, people people say that you farm for the lifestyle, but, you know, dairy
farming, I mean, the lifestyle kind of stinks. [Laughs]
Jared Schmidt 28:41
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 28:41
I have kids 24/7-365.
Jared Schmidt 28:43
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 28:43
And, and it doesn't, you know, there's not, it's not a financial benefit. So, even in terms of being
able to hire more people, so, how do you, how do you overcome that and how do you make it,
you know, return back to a quality of life that is worth having, and be able to spend time with
your family and all that. So this is, this is the road that we went down.
Jared Schmidt 28:49
Mhm. Yeah. [To Bart] How do you feel about the quality of life with the robotics and everything?
Bart Mizee 29:11
Yeah. Well, again, that the, the stage of my dairying, what with Kurt coming into it at that
timeframe and stuff, that...I wasn't the guy to be the leader at that point, so is easier to step
back and, and just be be a part of and help things, you know, come together and to make,
make those things work for everybody. And I think we, for the most part, done that fairly well,.
Jared Schmidt 30:02
Yeah. With the robotics, have you seen it increase the amount of milk that you're able to collect
K
K
K
B
at all? Or how's that influence
Kurt Mizee 30:09
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 30:10
overall dairy aspect of that?
Kurt Mizee 30:12
Yeah, pretty dramatically. So we, when we looked at, at doing it, we, we basically figured that
at 2011 labor rates, we could return the investment within nine years.
Jared Schmidt 30:26
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 30:27
And that's all that we really counted on, so. But we've seen cows actually lasting a full lactation
longer.
Jared Schmidt 30:35
Oh, really?
Kurt Mizee 30:36
So, you know, that, that by itself. You know, a cow, basically, has to get to two years in milk
before she even starts to return on her initial investment to raise her. So, if you can add
another year, economically, that's helpful. In addition to that, they were getting pregnant
faster. So, you know, they were, that's an indicator of, of essentially the happy cow.
Jared Schmidt 31:06
Right.
Kurt Mizee 31:06
K
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 31:06
I mean, she's doing well. And then, with all of those things happening, we were still able to
increase production, pretty dramatically. And...
Bart Mizee 31:19
Take, yeah, genetics and so in how those were brought into figuring out all these things, and
the result of that, yeah, so. All plus stuff.
Jared Schmidt 31:31
That's awesome.
Kurt Mizee 31:31
So it's, sort of bell shaped curve, a skewed bell-shaped curve for lactation cycle of a cow.
Jared Schmidt 31:39
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 31:40
And so, if you can actually milk her more on the front end, so, give her the opportunity to take
that pressure off, you know, here they can milk five times a day if they want to.
Jared Schmidt 31:51
Right.
Kurt Mizee 31:52
Because it's a completely voluntary system.
Jared Schmidt 31:53
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 31:54
And that will lead to a higher production and longer production plane for that cow. In addition
to that, because we're feeding each and every cow, the right amount of energy in the robot. So,
B
K
K
K
K
to that, because we're feeding each and every cow, the right amount of energy in the robot. So,
they get a high energy grain, there's largely wheat and corn, we can meet the needs of that
cow. So she, we support her,and her ability to produce that milk as best as possible. So, really,
it's uh, you know, that the cows are producing more and lasting longer. I mean, that's, that's a
pretty ideal scenario
Jared Schmidt 32:32
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 32:33
for the cow and for us. So, I think we can just care for them better. And then you add to the fact
we've got, you know, 120 plus data points for that cow in a day. Our ability to stay on top of
keeping her healthy is dramatically better.
Jared Schmidt 32:49
Yeah. That's...What does that, [To Bart] what is that like from going from your generation as
the dairy farmer and seeing this robotic influence? How does that, what it is, what does it make
you think, how does it make you feel about seeing that change?
Bart Mizee 33:06
Well, it's not every day that you feel joyful about it [Bart and Jared laugh]. But no, by and large.
Yeah, it, it makes sense. I mean, it's easy enough to, to take those parts and do and, yeah.
Some days you have to give a little more attention to, to these parts and such, but, it isn't the
regimented. Yeah, when I was doing it, it was to a point where it was, you know, milk machines
on at four in the morning and dragging home, probably closer to eight o'clock at night, and
stuff, so.
Jared Schmidt 33:59
Mkay.
Bart Mizee 33:59
Yeah, and then, and then to, yeah, to see the, like Kurt was talking about, the capabilities the
cow of, of giving, allowing her those, those things that she, she needs and can, can benefit
from in health and, and all that. Yeah, that's that's all positive stuff.
Jared Schmidt 34:21
Yeah, it seems really innovative and very cool. Like it, Kurt was showing me the volunteer
K
B
B
Yeah, it seems really innovative and very cool. Like it, Kurt was showing me the volunteer
aspect of it as opposed to well, it's nine o'clock, I have to do this, like, hold still. [All three
laugh] I bet there's a lot less getting kicked going on now.
Kurt Mizee 34:38
[Laughs]
Bart Mizee 34:38
Yeah, well, yeah. I think the whole atmosphere is, can be more relaxed in that sense.
Jared Schmidt 34:44
Okay. Have you seen a lot more robotics taking off in Tillamook County, like your system here,
or?
Kurt Mizee 34:49
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 34:50
Or is it still kind of catching up?
Kurt Mizee 34:51
No, I mean, there's, there's, I think four other systems in the county right now, and I know of at
least three more farms that have opened bids out, so.
Jared Schmidt 35:02
Mkay, to do the robotic system?
Kurt Mizee 35:04
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 35:05
Okay. That's interesting. I just didn't realize how few there were and that that was actually
K
B
K
K
K
Okay. That's interesting. I just didn't realize how few there were and that that was actually
really what was happening. Do you think that's going to be more of the future of dairy farming?
Is this, or is it more for your guys' size of farm, or?
Kurt Mizee 35:20
So, another quick rabbit trail here. So I, three years after we took on the robots here, I actually
took over the dealership for Western Oregon and Western Washington.
Jared Schmidt 35:33
Mmm.
Kurt Mizee 35:33
And I just sold it last summer.
Jared Schmidt 35:35
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 35:36
But in that time, we sold 23 robot projects. So that's, and they're writing and 24th right now. So
that's 1,700 cows.
Jared Schmidt 35:47
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 35:47
So, it's definitely capable of bigger farms, but it's a pretty big paradigm shift for a dairy farmer
to stand back and let the machine do its thing and trust that it's getting done. And, and that's
really the, I think, the biggest hurdle for most farmers is that ability to, to accept the new way
of doing things.
Jared Schmidt 36:17
Yeah.
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 36:17
I mean, essentially, even, you know, the machinery changed, and some of those sorts of things.
But basically, from, from the time that this farm was founded until 2011, we did things the
same way.
Jared Schmidt 36:29
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 36:30
We brought the cows to a place and we put the machines on or harvested the milk, you know,
one way or another, at that spot at the time that was convenient for us.
Jared Schmidt 36:39
Right.
Kurt Mizee 36:39
And then we let the cows go back out to eat. And so it's a whole, it's a whole shift, for sure. And
Jared Schmidt 36:46
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 36:46
and how things are done, and it works well. But, again, are you trusting enough and...
Bart Mizee 36:56
And, for me, I haven't jumped in on the trying to keep up on new technology, and such.
Jared Schmidt 37:05
You mean you don't have an app on your phone, like Kurt does for it?
Kurt Mizee 37:11
He does, but he might not have accessed for a while. [All three laugh]
K
K
K
K
B
K
He does, but he might not have accessed for a while. [All three laugh]
Bart Mizee 37:18
No, we have, we have other younger individuals and I can easily fill my time with stepping back
and taking care of those things that are kind of pushed aside or, or maybe not as desirable,
whatever. Anyway, just to help smooth, all that, so works together.
Jared Schmidt 37:41
Mkay.
Bart Mizee 37:41
And that's, that's more or less my role nowadays.
Jared Schmidt 37:44
So it's more hands off farming, it seems like, or, is that maybe too broad of a statement?
Bart Mizee 37:50
No, no, there's still a lot of it is, is simple stuff that is hands on [All three laugh].
Jared Schmidt 37:55
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 37:57
But it gets passed over easily, or because the busyness on something else and, and so,
somebody has to take care of that. And it's, it's critical that those things do happen, so.
Kurt Mizee 38:12
And while he's not doing it, we, you know, it does require more of the employees in terms of
their, their ability to digest what's going on and to fix, maybe, those mechanical issues.
Because, if something goes wrong, there's a call out system. And so we have a long call
rotation, which, I think dad's been off for for a couple years now. So, I think gratefully [All three
laugh]. So, my employees have to be able to respond and, and fix that issue. I mean, if it's a
serious issue, we can call a technician but that expensive, right? So,and then, and then just
B
B
B
B
K
how the whole system functions and, and making use of that data to make those management
decisions and, you know. So it's it's just a different environment all the way around. And I, they
would say that it's, it's better for them, too, they appreciate. I mean, they, the first guy gets
here at six o'clock in the morning, I mean, and then everybody's gone by six o'clock at night
and they have a split shift, so, it's a pretty good...
Bart Mizee 39:17
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 39:17
That sounds nice.
Kurt Mizee 39:18
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 39:19
And then how many employees do you have on the farm?
Kurt Mizee 39:23
Two, well, two-and-a-half nonfamily.
Jared Schmidt 39:26
Okay. Keyword nonfamily?
Kurt Mizee 39:29
Yeah. [Jared laughs] Yeah, my son works here when he's not in school, and my wife does some
the calf feeding and, so.
Jared Schmidt 39:38
Okay, that's cool. I was wondering, now, you showed me a little bit about the, how the
mechanical system, or the robot system works. I was wondering if you could explain how it
functions. What is the step-by-step of that,just briefly, or...
B
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 39:51
Sure.
Jared Schmidt 39:51
Because like the, I was fascinated by the collars and how the data points and all of that.
Kurt Mizee 39:55
Yeah. So, yeah, so I guess we'll start with the collars. So, each cow wears a collar that, that has
a, an individual code assigned to it and, and it also is reading her activity level. So it's got a
pedometer in it.
Jared Schmidt 40:10
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 40:10
And then it also has a microphone in it that's listening for the popping sound that a cow's jaw
makes when she chews. So, we're getting, essentially, what they call rumination counts, but,
like chomps per hour sort of indications.
Jared Schmidt 40:23
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 40:23
So, and we can use that to monitor health and everything else. But that caller has her ID. So, as
she walks into this individual stall, and it's just basically a set of gates kind of around her to
keep her protected from the other cows. It locates the cow, it reads her identity, it gives her, it
starts to distribute a specific amount of feed for what that cow needs. And it knows how fast
she'll milk so it will, it will feed her at a rate that keeps her eating the whole time she's in there.
Jared Schmidt 40:23
[Laughs]
Kurt Mizee 40:24
K
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 40:24
And that helps calm her down.
Jared Schmidt 40:40
Makes sense [Laughs]
Kurt Mizee 40:47
There is a, so this, this set of gates is next to a wall, basically, and from the other side of the
wall this arm comes in underneath the cow and it has a set of counter rotating brushes on it,
have a sanitizer solution. And that does a couple passes and cleans off the cow, but that also
stimulates her. So, this whole process is, takes about 90 seconds which is the amount of time
that it takes a cow to let down her milk.
Jared Schmidt 41:24
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 41:26
So, once she's clean, the brushes move out of the way. It has a four plane laser that scans the
udder. It already knows the last 30 teat positions. But the udder changes, depending on how
long it's been since her last milking so it locates those teats precisely, the cup flips up, the
milking cup, and goes on to each teat individually. And then it will milk her out and as, as each
teat, each of the four quarters finishes milking it will pull that one off. Once she's done it
rescans and applies iodine to the teats to keep her clean until the next milking. And so, in
about six-and-a-half-minutes, she will have given about four gallons of milk.
Jared Schmidt 42:17
Really?
Kurt Mizee 42:18
So, and she'll do that, you know, three times a day. So, our our cows average about 10 gallons
of milk per day.
Jared Schmidt 42:26
Okay.
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 42:27
And the high cows are 20 plus gallons a day, so.
Jared Schmidt 42:32
That's amazing.
Kurt Mizee 42:32
Yeah. And, and all the, you know, this is a fairly high, fat high protein milk. So it's about four
and a half percent fat.
Jared Schmidt 42:43
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 42:44
And a little under three and a half percent protein. But that's because we're making cheese out
of it.
Jared Schmidt 42:49
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 42:49
And so, you need those components to make cheese.
Jared Schmidt 42:52
Mkay, right.
Kurt Mizee 42:53
And that's actually what we're paid on.
Jared Schmidt 42:54
You're paid on...?
K
K
K
K
K
You're paid on...?
Kurt Mizee 42:55
The fat and protein level.
Jared Schmidt 42:56
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 42:57
In addition to the volume, but it's, it's a formula based around that, so.
Jared Schmidt 43:01
Is that how it was when, before the robots, too? Or has it always been with the Creamery
involvement, or?
Bart Mizee 43:08
Yeah, basically.
Jared Schmidt 43:09
Mkay.
Bart Mizee 43:10
I mean, as far as those components being, yeah, critical to, and of course volume.
Jared Schmidt 43:16
Right.
Kurt Mizee 43:17
And, and where the robots make the difference is, we can actually see that, that level per cow.
So, we actually used to have a tester come once a month and pull a sample from every cow.
And then we would get her fat and protein level and quality indicators and all that sort of thing.
K
K
B
B
K
But, depending on whether she was off that day, or a little extra feed, or whatever, you know,
that's, it's it's sort of dicey data.
Jared Schmidt 43:40
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 43:40
But now we're getting that three times a day.
Jared Schmidt 43:42
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 43:43
And so we know exactly which cows are profitable. And we can actually export that to a
spreadsheet that has the Tillamook pay price, and we can know how much money that cow is
returning every second she's in the box.
Jared Schmidt 43:55
That's is just, yeah. Kurt can atest, I geeked out really hard when I was watching the system go.
[Kurt laughs] I had never seen anything quite like that before. Like it knew were to, I was
imagining him having to hook it up, but...
Kurt Mizee 44:09
Well, and I mean, what's kind of, you know, there's robotics in it and everything now, right,
but...
Jared Schmidt 44:15
With my recorder [[All laugh].
Kurt Mizee 44:16
But if you're flipping a burger or painting a car, it does the same repetitive action. I mean, this,
this thing, actually, the the cow might jump around a little bit, she might kick it, especially if it's
her first time and she doesn't know what's happening yet. So this thing can take some abuse
K
K
K
K
and has to react and respond pretty quickly.
Jared Schmidt 44:35
I suppose.
Kurt Mizee 44:35
And, and our, our expected downtime. We only run about 5%, free time on the machine.
Jared Schmidt 44:43
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 44:44
So, anything more than about two hours of that machine down any given time of the day, 365
days a year, is a problem.
Jared Schmidt 44:51
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 44:52
So, pretty, I mean, really, the technology is, when you think about that, it's done that for almost
11 years, that's pretty impressive. Yeah.
Bart Mizee 45:01
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 45:01
That's the same one that you bought originally, from 2011?
Kurt Mizee 45:03
Yep.
K
K
K
B
K
Jared Schmidt 45:04
Wow.
Kurt Mizee 45:05
Yup.
Jared Schmidt 45:05
Okay. Yeah, because as soon as that one cow was done, another one tried to come in, right?
Kurt Mizee 45:10
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 45:11
But it said no to her.
Kurt Mizee 45:12
Right. So yeah, if, if it's been too soon since her last milking, it will refuse her. So essentially,
the gate opens back up and she walks out the other end without having been milked. And so
that's, you know, two things. One, you can over milk a cow. But the other thing is, it just eats
up time on the machine that, you know, so we're trying to optimize that.
Jared Schmidt 45:33
So it's not like a cow that just happens to keep, like, getting fed, just keeps walking in, and...
Bart Mizee 45:37
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 45:37
[Laughs] It's not a buffet. You know, we have mostly Holsteins, but I've seen Jerseys that, that
will just literally make circles into a robot just to see if they can make it happen again, so.
[Jared and Bart laugh]
K
K
K
B
K
Jared Schmidt 45:49
I would like to, I would enjoy seeing that [Kurt and Bart laugh] Like a little buffet of grain, that's
really funny. So you have what kind of cow, you said you have...
Kurt Mizee 45:57
Holsteins, generally. And then there's, there's a couple Jerseys, a couple Ayershires that are
largely leftover from 4H and FFA projects from the kids, so, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 46:10
Mkay. So you said the machine can, the robot can work 24 hours. Do the, the cows just keep
getting milk 24 hours a day? Or is it, does say, like, the robot clocks out at a certain time, too?
Kurt Mizee 46:20
No, everything just keeps on running. So, generally, there's a slow time of the day, which is
about one o'clock until about three o'clock in the morning.
Jared Schmidt 46:29
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 46:29
And it just, the cows just aren't as active. So, this time of year, we actually allow them to start
accessing pasture and midnight.
Jared Schmidt 46:38
Hmm.
Kurt Mizee 46:38
And once they know that it's time to start going to pasture, and that they have to milk it before
they can go to pasture that will keep the robot busy during what's normally a slow time. So, just
strategies like that, that we try and employ to, you know, keep the system as at capacity as
possible. But yeah, it, so, even, we shut down three times a day to wash the line, and the
system, and everything else. And that, that's the only real shut-off time and that's about 20
minutes each time it shuts, off so we lose about an hour there. The other thing that has to
happen is the milk truck has to pick up.
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 47:17
Mhm. Mkay, I was gonna ask about the milk truck
Kurt Mizee 47:22
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 47:23
and the milk process with that.
Kurt Mizee 47:24
That picks up daily. And, but he comes in and he hits a button that sends the milk coming from
the robots to a small, what they call a buffer tank, and it's stored there while he picks up the
milk and the tank that holds the milk is washed.
Jared Schmidt 47:42
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 47:43
And once that process is done, then it automatically drains into the tank and we start this
whole cycle again for another 24 hours.
Jared Schmidt 47:49
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 47:50
So, but it is all automated, again,and it all happens with a series of air valves and, you know,
that sort of thing, so.
Jared Schmidt 47:57
How many gallons of milk a day it is does your farm, then, give to the, you know, send to the
creamery?
K
K
K
K
creamery?
Kurt Mizee 48:05
Well, we usually talk pounds with milk.
Bart Mizee 48:08
Yeah, yeah.
Jared Schmidt 48:08
Whichever, whichever works easiest, yeah.
Bart Mizee 48:11
Because that's how, yeah.
Kurt Mizee 48:12
Yeah. I guess we're shipping around 13,000 pounds of milk a day right now.
Jared Schmidt 48:18
How many how many was that?
Kurt Mizee 48:19
13,000, so.
Jared Schmidt 48:22
I can't even imagine 13,000 pounds of milk, just seeing that, what's that like. So they come
once a day or multiple times, you said, the trucks?
Bart Mizee 48:32
We're on a one day, everyday pickup. I don't know exactly how it is. The norm would have been
every other day.
K
B
B
K
K
B
Jared Schmidt 48:42
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 48:42
But I don't know what those numbers are. Right today for the for the factory. I'm not sure.
Jared Schmidt 48:49
And then how long is this, this your farm been involved with the Tillamook Creamery?
Bart Mizee 48:57
Well, there, there were, I'm not sure how many separate creamerys in the county.
Jared Schmidt 49:04
Right.
Bart Mizee 49:04
And there was a period, back when there was a division and, I can't remember, exactly, the
dates of when, when that all finally came back together again.
Jared Schmidt 49:32
Yeah, I know the, I know the year. I know it's in the back of my mind somewhere buzzing
around.
Kurt Mizee 49:38
Basically we've shipped to a local processor.
Jared Schmidt 49:41
Right, since is always.
Kurt Mizee 49:42
Yeah.
B
B
B
K
K
Yeah.
Bart Mizee 49:42
Yes.
Jared Schmidt 49:42
Okay.
Bart Mizee 49:43
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 49:43
And then you've been involved with the Creamery, itself, since that really solidified? As far as
one entity kind of thing, right?
Bart Mizee 49:49
Um, well, no longer than that.
Jared Schmidt 49:52
Okay.
Bart Mizee 49:53
Because even when things were separate, you're still Yeah,
Jared Schmidt 49:56
Mkay. What's that like working with this, like, billion dollar company as a century farm? It's just
a lot of dyanimcs, like, century farm - billion dollar company.
Kurt Mizee 50:10
Yeah. So, both grandpa and dad have served on the board down there at different times for a
significant amount of time. It, as the company grows, and one of the things that I've tried to
pass on to the CEO is that it's going to be more important to route people in the culture of
B
B
B
B
K
Tillamook, and what it looks like the dairy farm because, you know, there's offices in the
Portland area now.
Jared Schmidt 50:44
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 50:44
And some people don't even. I mean, we, so, one of the tours that we more routinely give is
operations and field staff from the Creamery, will bring people from the Portland area, out
marketing people and that sort of thing to just see what it's all about. So to, you know, the
culture of a company, as it grows, will change, but trying to keep those things rooted in, you
know, the...
Bart Mizee 51:13
Historic values.
Kurt Mizee 51:14
Yeah. And even as, as people have come to farm here, you know, it's changed things. It, I
mean, this is, this valley is really regarded, this co-op is regarded as, as really the best place to
milk cows in the country.
Jared Schmidt 51:33
Mkay.
Kurt Mizee 51:33
I mean, from a, from a brand perspective, and what that brand's been able to do for the
farmers. So, if people are looking to milk cows somewhere else, this is sort of the, the bucket
list, right?
Jared Schmidt 51:47
Yeah. This is the coup de gras.
Kurt Mizee 51:50
Yeah. But, but that, that changes the, the makeup of, you know, who's here and what they
K
B
K
K
K
Yeah. But, but that, that changes the, the makeup of, you know, who's here and what they
understand from, you know, the history of 100 years versus, you know. I mean, our our
neighbors have been here for I think 30 years now. And, you know, some people will say they're
still not locals, right? So it's...I mean, I...
Jared Schmidt 52:12
As somebody who moved here from the Midwest...
Bart Mizee 52:13
Yeah, yeah, there you go.[All three laugh]
Jared Schmidt 52:16
So,I understand.
Kurt Mizee 52:19
So yeah, it's I mean, it's, it's a source of pride that that people have accepted the product and
recognize the quality.
Jared Schmidt 52:28
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 52:29
Because, that, there's a lot of work that goes into making a truly quality product at, from the
farm level on up. I mean, if, you know, my, my dairy foods professor at Oregon State said, you
know, garbage in, garbage out. And so, if we're not doing our job here to, in really focused on
quality, then the rest of it sort of falls apart.
Jared Schmidt 52:51
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 52:54
But, but being able to hold that, keep the culture connected to the farms and the farmers is,
that's going to be the challenge moving ahead, for sure.
B
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 53:03
Yeah. What's that like to be part of that legacy? Because it sounds like you've been, your
family's been involved with the Creamery for quite a while, or the creamery like culture. What's
that like to be a part of that?
Bart Mizee 53:14
No, I think there's a lot of pride for those who have been, for some time that, in, in that, and
that, they've really come to understand and, and want to be in that realm. I will say that, you
know, pretty much when I was first back here, we did have a Minnesota veterinarian who did
our our work here for us. And quite a character.
Jared Schmidt 53:55
We have that tendency.
Kurt Mizee 54:00
Yeah, when I travel, when I fly somewhere, I mean, I wear my Tillamook t-shirt, almost
exclusively just to see who has what to say.
Jared Schmidt 54:08
I was gonna ask about when you when you're out and about or sorry, oot and aboot, for the
Minnesotans [Kurt and Bart laugh] as you go on about what's it like to see the Tillamook brand,
the Tillamook logo? Because, I, my parents, whenever they see Tillamook cheese, they'll send
me a picture, or my sister's wedding shower they had Tillamook cheddar. And everyone kept
ask me if I tried this stuff yet. And I'm like, ''Guys, I live there. I know." [All three chuckle]
Kurt Mizee 54:33
Yes.
Bart Mizee 54:34
Oh, I think, yeah, plenty of pride that we are as small as we are, and yet the impact we've
gained, now, in the last few years, you know, across to the the other sea coast.
Jared Schmidt 54:54
Mhm.
B
K
K
B
Kurt Mizee 54:57
I mean
Bart Mizee 54:57
Yeah...
Kurt Mizee 54:58
it was it was common, you know, even 10 years ago for people to come to town and, and to
load up a box and ship it to friends, right? I mean, that was, because that was the only way you
could do it. But, you know, I mean, my brother lives in New Jersey and, you know, friends all
across the eastern seaboard that, you know, are just so grateful that they can get the product
now readily. And so, yeah, that's, that's been fun to see. And, and, you know, and, I mean,
speaking of traveling, I mean, you can go somewhere and get a quality dairy product now
[Laughs], when you're from here, and you have to go somewhere, and, and, you know, I mean,
it's just part of our diet, so [All three laugh] What you end up with something that you're not
quite as enthused about when you leave the grocery store.
Bart Mizee 55:48
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 55:48
So, you know, and, and, you know, I've been in Hawai'i and seeing people at the, you know, the
supermarket looking at the dairy case, and I'm like, "Oh, you should try that Tillamook one, you
know, that's, you're gonna be happy you did" kind of thing, so.
Jared Schmidt 56:02
Yeah. You have a horse in that race, as well, yeah.
Kurt Mizee 56:05
Yeah. So, anyway, so yeah, it's neat to see for sure. And, and I mean, there's, it, for us here, it's
hard to believe that you know, people haven't had the chance to have something that good.
Jared Schmidt 56:24
Mhm.
K
B
K
B
K
K
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 56:24
I mean, I, I think most people's dogs and cats here won't eat anything else other than [Kurt and
Bart laugh]. He couldn't even give them a piece of something else, so.
Jared Schmidt 56:32
Our neighbor, does, has that. He knows exactly which type of cheddar his beagles like the best
[Kurt and Bart laugh]. He's done tests. It's this one. It's like, I forget exactly, but he's he's tried
it. Like which Beagle liked which cheese more? They won't eat the other one, like you were
saying, so I, I've seen that. For real, he has a fanny pack that he puls a little cheddar out [Kurt
and Bart laugh]. That's pretty funny. Well then, speaking of that, do you guys have a particular
favorite cheese from Tillamook? I always try to ask everybody which what's your favorite
cheese from there, i you have one.
Kurt Mizee 56:48
Yeah.
Bart Mizee 57:04
I, I can't really say that I that I do.
Jared Schmidt 57:10
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 57:14
Kind of depends what it's paired with, you know.
Jared Schmidt 57:16
Right. Yeah. What's the mood?
Bart Mizee 57:18
But yeah, and that, that, too. Yeah, I don't know
K
K
B
B
B
Kurt Mizee 57:22
I mean, I like the smoked black pepper, quite a bit.
Jared Schmidt 57:27
That is a good one.
Kurt Mizee 57:29
The one, they were calling Cape Mears, and I don't know what, what they're calling it...
Jared Schmidt 57:33
English Style Sweet Cheddar.
Kurt Mizee 57:34
Yeah, that's it.
Bart Mizee 57:35
Yup.
Jared Schmidt 57:35
That's, that's our favorite, too, so [Laughs].
Kurt Mizee 57:37
Bribe with cheddar? I'm gonna crumble something off and, you know, have it with crackers or
whatever. I mean, it's a little aged, and, yeah, that's, that's pretty tough to beat. So, I mean,
you know, yeah, that the regular cheddar, you know, day-in and day-out is sort of the
workhorse around the house. But yeah, if I'm going to, if I'm going to take some...So if I'm going
bird hunting on the other side of the state, I mean, that's, that's probably one I'll grab to get a
gate open or something like that you know, so. Yeah. Yep.
Jared Schmidt 57:39
Hey, it works. Right?
K
K
K
B
K
Bart Mizee 57:40
Big [Pounds table].
Jared Schmidt 57:44
Yeah, that's awesome. So then your, your milk, then you mentioned, is it expressly for the
cheese? Or does it go to the ice cream as well? Or how does that?
Kurt Mizee 58:16
It, I mean, that, it's all blended at the plant.
Jared Schmidt 58:19
Right.
Kurt Mizee 58:19
So, it's hard to know exactly.
Jared Schmidt 58:21
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 58:22
But, yeah, most, most of the milk here is for aged cheese is, is the preferred use, just because
it takes...So,just like wine, if you have a good product, or if you have a not good product, it
won't age well.
Jared Schmidt 58:40
Right.
Kurt Mizee 58:41
And so.
Jared Schmidt 58:42
B
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 58:42
Garbage in, garbage out, like you said.
Kurt Mizee 58:43
Yeah, exactly. And so, that's.
Jared Schmidt 58:44
I'm gonna steal that, by the way.
Kurt Mizee 58:45
Yeah, you're good. Have at it.
Jared Schmidt 58:48
That's excellent. Well then, one last thing I want to ask is before I let you go, before I
skedaddle. What do you think the future of dairy farming in Tillamook County, in this part of the
country looks like? Is it more robotic? Is it more conglomerating? Or family? What is, what do
you think?
Kurt Mizee 59:04
So we're in this interesting process right now where they've decided that they're going to cap
the growth of the co-op back where we're at, actually where we were at, as of March to keep
this community, for one thing, similar to how it looks now.
Jared Schmidt 59:24
Okay.
Kurt Mizee 59:26
And to provide some, some value assurance to the farmers. So, it's sort of this big unknown
right now what that is going to look like over the next you know, even 10 years. But, I'm
hopeful that, that will allow a profitability for the farmers that allows them to stay. And also to
take care of the land that we've got here that, you know, I mean, we do get a lot of rain and,
you know, there's, there are challenges associated with that. So, um, there's a ton of, well, A,
it's hard to find people to work. But, even more, so when you're talking about farm labor that is,
you know, long, early, late hours, that sort of thing. So, and if you couple that with agriculture,
which has traditionally been exempt from overtime,
K
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 59:51
Mhm. Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 1:00:28
because of the seasonal, you know, fluctuation that we have, is now required to pay overtime.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:35
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 1:00:35
So, all those things are going to change what farming looks like, and technology is going to
help, you know, clear that hurdle.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:46
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 1:00:47
So, you know, hopefully, that all ends up being better for the farm families, so we can continue
to sustain them here.
Jared Schmidt 1:00:58
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 1:00:59
I mean, I think it will, you know, if we play our cards, right, it will continue to be the, the place
to be for dairy farmers and, and hopefully, avoid some of the consolidation that's going on in
the rest of the country.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:14
Right.
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 1:01:15
Because we've seen a pretty good attrition in terms of the numbers of, of actual farms. So, we,
when I came back from college, I think there was a little over, there was like 185 farms
shipping milk to Tillamook, and we're down in the 60s now.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:34
Really?
Kurt Mizee 1:01:34
So, and that's, you know, only been since '99.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:39
You guys are, so you're one of the surviving farms really?
Kurt Mizee 1:01:44
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:01:46
What do you think the future then look like, then, for, Bart? What do you think it looks like?
Bart Mizee 1:01:53
Yeah, I'm, I'm hopeful for those things that, like Kurt mentioned, but...I was just gonna say, for
us, we've had, on several occasions, with a, a new employee there was some sort of a hiccup
early on. And we were able to step forward and, and be helpful and, and such. And that really
generated some pretty strong loyalty.
Jared Schmidt 1:02:38
Mhm.
Bart Mizee 1:02:39
And so, that's been something that's, that has been good. But, again, like, all those things are
changing, so much, and, and...Don't know, [Kurt and Bart chuckle] I just don't know.
K
K
K
B
B
Jared Schmidt 1:03:01
As long as you keep in the game, right?
Bart Mizee 1:03:02
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:03
Yeah. And this is what your son is, maybe, hopefully going to do, or your grandson? Hopefully
he'll be a dairy farmer too, or?
Kurt Mizee 1:03:09
Well, as of right now, he's...
Jared Schmidt 1:03:10
On the record, what is he going to do, right? [All three laugh]
Kurt Mizee 1:03:14
So I, I, when, when it was first, just the two of us after his mom and sister passed away, I told
him when you graduate eighth grade, we'll go on a trip, and we're gonna go to Florida Keys,
we're gonna go fishing.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:27
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 1:03:28
And he remembered [Laughs]. I had forgotten, but he remembered we were going on this trip.
But part of that trip was to say to him, that if you don't feel compelled to do this, there's no
pressure. Because it is a, it's a hard job. And even if you love it, it's a hard job. And if you don't
love it, it's, it's nearly impossible. So, right now he's got other interests and, and is not looking
to study agriculture or anything that way.
Jared Schmidt 1:03:56
B
K
K
K
Jared Schmidt 1:03:56
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 1:03:57
That's not to say that, you know, one of my best friends until he was 25 wasn't planning to
come back. So, my goal is to, to have it here for him if it's something he wants to do.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:12
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 1:04:13
And I would love to farm with him. But there's absolutely no pressure to do that if he doesn't
want to. He's, he's, you know, he's showing cows at the fair. And he's, you know, a district FFA
officer and, I mean, he loves agriculture, and he's involved in it. But I don't know that that's his
passion.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:29
Mhm.
Kurt Mizee 1:04:31
So, we'll see. For right now we've got to the summer and next to, to enjoy working with him and
have, you know, for generations here on the farm, on a daily basis.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:43
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 1:04:43
And that's pretty cool.
Jared Schmidt 1:04:44
Yeah. That's gotta be pretty special.
K
K
K
K
Kurt Mizee 1:04:46
Yeah. And then, then we'll just see what happens, so,.
Bart Mizee 1:04:49
Yeah, he can, he can find out if he [with laughter] chooses what it's like not to
Jared Schmidt 1:04:55
Yeah.
Bart Mizee 1:04:56
to be close to that, but, yeah.
Kurt Mizee 1:04:59
And sometimes it takes getting away to realize that it is right what do you want to do and
that's. But, I mean, you know, my, my brother and my sister, neither one of them are involved
with the farm and, and so, you know it's just a matter of deciding that and figuring that out, so.
Terry Mizee 1:05:14
No, no [Terry returns through front door and a dog enters with her, sitting down beside Kurt]
Jared Schmidt 1:05:16
The dog wants to come in. Looks like the dog found her way in, it's way [Bart and Jared laugh]
Bart Mizee 1:05:28
Oh [Laughs].
Terry Mizee 1:05:30
Did you get it all?
Jared Schmidt 1:05:30
Yes, well, I was just gonna say that's all I have for questions, right now,unless you all want to
add anything else. We were just discussing the future of dairy farming just now, and they gave

add anything else. We were just discussing the future of dairy farming just now, and they gave
me the, all the information,all the,all the insides. So if you have anything else you'd like to add
anybody, or?
Terry Mizee 1:05:51
Not...
Jared Schmidt 1:05:52
That's okay.
Terry Mizee 1:05:53
No, I, when you look at indeed how it's changed. I was thinking as I was coming down the road
my dad was sitting out on the deck and they used to talk about when they needed to take the
cows to a different pasture how, you know, they took them over the bridge and back towards,
basically, I think it was back, more where Kiersten is now, back...
Kurt Mizee 1:06:19
Kind of off Bay Ocean Road
Terry Mizee 1:06:20
Yeah.
Kurt Mizee 1:06:21
and up the hill.
Terry Mizee 1:06:22
Yeah, yeah, back that way. And they would walk them, and out Whiskey Creek, they'd walk
them clear out there, which is, you know, miles really.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:30

And then come back, and, because they didn't have ways to haul them then.
Bart Mizee 1:06:36
They didn't have a fifth wheeler to...
Jared Schmidt 1:06:37
No, to just load them up and take them wherever you want to take them in. Yeah, it was
definitely definitely different time. Different world. Yeah.
Terry Mizee 1:06:46
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:46
Now with robots [Laughs]
Terry Mizee 1:06:47
Yeah. It's great life, but it's not an easy one, necessarily. That's what Kurt was just saying, too.
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:06:59
Well sounds good. Well, with that, if anybody has anything else they'd like to add, I'll, I'll stop
the interview right there, if that's okay?
Kurt Mizee 1:07:06
Yeah.
Jared Schmidt 1:07:06
