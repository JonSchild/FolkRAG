[Letter from John A. Lomax to Harold Spivacke]
Brownsville, Tex. 4/26/1939.
Dear Mr. Spivacke:
1. Send me, please, University Station, Austin, Texas, a “To Whom it may Concern” letter
of introduction that will serve to get me by Governors, wardens, and such like. One signed
by you will suffice.
2. A dozen small-sized blanks records for gifts to singers would help me over many rough
places.
Thanks. Yours, John A. Lomax
