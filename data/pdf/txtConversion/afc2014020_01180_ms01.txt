4th generation owner of Jekanowski family farm with Brother Paul in Hadley, Massachusetts. We are 
taking over the family’s farm main crops tobacco and potatoes 
June 17th he turned 38 
Started working in tobacco when old enough to drive the tractor out in the field. When I was able to 
steer it I started working in the fields. Instead of hiring a babysitter it was easier for my parents to keep 
watch on us. About 5 at the time 
 
1:40 Have done everything from planting it to the final packaging and selling of it. Not much has 
changed over the years. Some of the equipment we use is considered primitive. But there is no way to 
mechanize the process any more. 
2:26 We grow broadleaf tobacco. Over the years the acreage has changed. In 50’s-60’s we had about 20 
acres. In 70’s and 80’s demand went down so we dropped down to between 8-10 acres. Now we are 
back up to about 12 acres. We’ll stay there for the foreseeable future. Demand seems like it is kind of 
steady 
3:32 Demand is still going up but year to year we don’t know what the demand will be so we diversify 
into other crops.  
4:09 We sell our tobacco to a broker in Connecticut. We’ve dealt with him and his father and now his 
granddaughter. Ultimately our tobacco ends up in the Dominican. The Fuentes in particular. 
5:00 The buyers come throughout the season and check on the progress. One thing about our buyer is 
that we have always had a good relationship with him. Probably could have gotten more money in the 
90’s when the price skyrocketed but we stayed with him. Other buyers came through at the time and 
offered more but they are gone now. We’ve stuck with our buyer. He takes care of us and we take care 
of him. Security 
6:21 I’ve done every aspect that there is in tobacco. The month of August is the most hectic because the 
harvest takes place them. Have to be careful not to damage the leaf. 
7:16 Firing the tobacco only happens with shade tobacco. Charcoal helps it dry down. We let it dry down 
naturally by opening the shed’s doors. Early in the season once they are open they stay open unless it 
gets windy or a storm is coming. It is a quick process to open and close them. Later on as the tobacco 
dries down it gets more brittle. If there is a strong north or south wind we will close one side and leave 
the other open. We are always mindful of the weather and the wind. Have to keep the tobacco from 
shattering. 
9:27 After we harvest and hang it in the sheds it usually takes about a month and a half or two months 
before we can take it down, strip it and bale it. Once we are done harvesting tobacco we go to squash 
and potatoes. After potatoes are in we go back to tobacco. 
10:18 Take down in the middle to late October. Depends on how fast it dries down. Some years it takes 
longer than others. If it is a damp fall it will take longer to dry down.  
10:58 All our sheds are right here in the fields. About all of them were built in 1938. That year a 
hurricane came through and demolished most of the sheds. Here in Hadley there was one carpenter 
who had forms and jigs and he could build a shed quickly. He built most of the sheds in the area.  
12:11 When the sheds were knocked down by the hurricane it was our grandmother who took out a 
mortgage to rebuild the sheds. And they were built better after the hurricane. The Hurricane came 
when the harvest was finished up and the sheds were full. One day the storm came and it was so 
intense and the sheds were not built as well, some without foundations or piers. They’d pile stones 
every 15 feet and that is what they’d build it on. Once the wind came, a lot of those sheds were knocked 
over. 
13.37 Two of our sheds have 10 Bents. One has 8 one has 9 and one has 12. The twelve acres will fill all 
of those sheds. 
14:10 The most workers we have are in August about 10-15 people. We usually get students and local 
kids but we do have a few full time employees. Mostly people we know or we get through word of 
mouth. Our harvest is usually just in the afternoons 4-5 hours a day. 
15:30 Smell gets better as the tobacco ages but it is all sort of routine to us. We are usually later than 
other farmers because the potato harvest takes us till the middle of October. Our tobacco is taken down 
later. It is colder by then and it is harder to get damp days to work with the tobacco so we use a boiler to 
dampen the leaves. Mixing the steam with the tobacco smells really good. 
16:41 The boiler is parked outside of the shed. It is on wheels so we can move it from shed to shed. The 
hose goes in the shed and someone can point the steam to where it is needed.  
17.25We do have some leeway in harvesting but we don’t want the tobacco to get to big. We know 
when it was planted so we go by that when we harvest. But taking it down – it could stay in the shed all 
winter but still we want to sell it and get the income from it. We are usually taking it down in November 
and December so we rely on steam. By then it is tough to get warm humid days. 
18:18 We leave about a half a dozen plants in the field and we’ll get enough seed to last us about five 
years.  
18:34 We don’t use any service to test for germs or viruses. We usually know. Viruses on a plant don’t 
travel into the seed.  
19:05 Originally my great grand parents, grandparents and my father into the 80’s used Havana tobacco. 
That dropped to the wayside and the buyers wanted broadleaf. That is all they want now. The State of 
Conn. has an experimentation station. The scientist there is always developing breeds and strains of 
tobacco that are insect and disease resistant. Every couple of season we use their newest variety. The 
one that came out about 10 years ago works well for us and the buyer likes it. 
20:50 I worry about it right from seed to delivery. 
21:10 Tobacco is about 50% of our income. We lump potatoes butternut squash, asparagus and cabbage 
into another 50%. We only need 12 acres of tobacco but we have 40 acres of potatoes, 10 of squash, 
asparagus and cabbage so we only need 12 acres of tobacco and 60 acres for the rest. But tobacco is a 
high risk crop. Anything can happen to it. Hail, disease, viruses have been our biggest concern. It is a 
gamble but it can pay off. 
22:49 I will stick with farming. I think that there is always going to be a demand for some tobacco. 
23:01 Our buyer encourages us and the way he talks about the industry he is always looking for new 
places to sell tobacco. It is a tough business but I think that there is a future in it as long as the 
government doesn’t tax it too much. Then people will say it is not worth it anymore.
