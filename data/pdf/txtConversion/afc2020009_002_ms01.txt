JOHN PROBUS, Silversmith
Katy Clune  0:00
Alright, so the tape is rolling. We can go ahead and get started. It is Thursday, March 4, 2021, 
Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell here at Replacements Limited with, would you please introduce 
yourself?
John Probus  0:36
John Probus, silversmith.
KC  0:39
And John, I'm going to start out by asking a couple just, biographical questions. When and where 
were you born?
JP  0:47
I was born in Louisville, Kentucky 1963.
KC  0:52
And tell us a little bit about how you found yourself being silversmith for Replacements Limited. 
What was, sort of, your schooling and early career?
JP  1:06
Well, when I first started, I started working for a jeweler in Kentucky. They had three jewelry 
stores. They had a silver exchange, and they also had a silver refinery. And that's where I started. 
I started working part time when I was going to high school.
KC  1:24
And that was around Louisville you said?
JP  1:26
Yeah, that was Louisville, Kentucky. Yeah. And that was 1980. And that's when I started.
KC  1:33
And what is a silver refinery?
JP  1:36
A silver refinery is where we take the old scrap--- this is back when the, the Hunt brothers tried to 
corner the market, and tried to buy up all the silver. They almost did. And people were buying 
and selling scrap silver, like candelabras. And flatware sets, you know. They were selling it 
because the market went up to like, almost $40 an ounce. And that's when I got my start. I started 
working part time, I was going, I was going to high school.  And a gentlemen--- his father 
worked for this company and got me on this company. And we started work, I started working
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
there at the refinery. Purifying silver, selling it to the investors. We would take the silver, and we
would smelt it, put it in these big pots, and it's smelted into bars, and then we'd purify it, through
the pure, purifying system. And we poured into bars, and then we'd sell to investors. And that's
how I started back in 1981.
KC  2:40
You mentioned the Hunt brothers. Who are they? Is that just the people who owned that....?
JP  2:46
No, they they--- you know, they were back in the early 80s. You know, they, these Hunt brothers,
they were millionaires and they were trying to buy up all the silver. Corner the market and drive
the price up to where they can pretty much ask their own price on the silver. So that's when I
actually got into it. You know, a buddy of mine, his father was working for the company and got
me on. And I started working for the refinery. Milton Silver.
KC  3:16
What did your parents do for a living?
JP  3:18
My dad worked for a printing company. My mom she was a homemaker. My dad worked for a
printing company, working--- working a printing press.
KC  3:27
And---- we're getting a lot of natural sound on this interview. I thought I just heard a phone ring.
How long were you---- what was the name of that first shop and refinery that you were at?
JP  3:44
It was Buschemeyer's Jewelers in Kentucky. Like I said, they had three jewelry stores. And then
they had the refinery. And then they had, also had the silver exchange where they bought and
sold silver flatware, hollowware like tea sets and stuff like that. And then, when I--- after I had
started I worked for a while for the refinery, and then I went I transferred over to the restoration
department where I started silver restoration
Julia Gartrell  3:55
So this rush on silver, is this happening all over the country? Or was it localized?
JP  4:22
Well, I mean, yeah, there was you know, I mean, that was, you know, they tried to corner the
market, you know, back in 80s the Hunt brothers
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  4:29
So every  major city would have this kind of processing going on?
JP  4:34
Yeah, I mean, silver---- well the silver market went up crazy. I don't know if you keep up with
the silver market now. But I mean, it has its peaks. You know, where it, where it goes up, you
know. And a couple, just a couple years ago it went up to like 40 something dollars an ounce. I
don't know what the reason for that was, I mean, because I don't keep up with the market like I
used to. And I was just a little kid. You know, so I just needed a job.
KC  4:58
And so you learned on the job?
JP  5:01
Yeah. Yeah, I train with that. Like I said, the company that used to work for,  Buschemeyer's,
they were, they were a jewelry store. They had like three jewelry stores, silver exchange, and the
silver restoration, you know, the silver refinery. And I trained, you know, they, they let me to go
to different places, and I pretty much trained,  pretty much everything.
KC  5:30
And what about---- how did the move from, how did you find yourself specializing in the
restoration aspect?
JP  5:39
Well, there was a guy named Robert Gerard he is the one that taught me the craft. And he told
me,  you know--- because I was, I was moving around, you know, because I experienced, you
know, I work with jewelry, doing jewelry repair and stuff like that. And he told me well, there's
not very many people in silversmiths. And if you come over and work with me, he said, you'll
never need a job. So I went with him and started doing silver re--restoration. I've been doing it
ever since. And fortunately, you know, he was right. I never had to go look for a job.
KC  6:10
So your education was really with him, in restoration?
JP  6:14
Yeah, I mean, he was a silversmith and very talented.
KC  6:18
What was his story?
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JP  6:19
Ah, he was a silversmith, you know, and very talented silversmith. And he'd been doing it for
years. And I, you know, he kind of took me under his wing and started teaching me the craft.
And I've, you know, kind of worked for him, for him as his apprentice, you know, for like seven
years. And then he pretty much taught me the craft of silversmithing.
KC  6:41
Did he have other apprentices?
JP  6:45
Yeah, he worked with another guy. Name was uh, Bud Moore, he was an older guy. And actually,
he kind of taught Bob Gerard and then Bob taught me. So it's like the three of us.
KC  7:01
And how--- tell us about that. Like, is there a story you can share? Just how was it, like, being an
apprentice with Rob, for that long? I mean, seven years?
JP  7:15
Well, I mean, you know, I mean---- we got to be pretty good buddies. He was, he was an older
gentleman. And he pretty much taught me, you know, everything I needed to know about silver
restoration. I don't know if you're familiar with silver restoration. There's a lot to it, you know,
soldering, you know. And we do a lot of work, you know, with, you know, candelabras, and
punch bowls, and teapots. And he pretty much taught me everything I knew, you know I needed
to know far as restoration goes.
KC  7:47
Before we get to Replacements do you have...?
JG  7:49
Yeah, I would love to hear about that shop. So how did, how did stuff come in the door? Did
people come in saying "this was my great grandmother's punch bowl" and the handle broke off....
JP  7:59
You mean back when the, when the silver market?
KC  8:01
Yeah what were people coming in and saying?
JP  8:03
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Yeah, back then now, you know, I mean, we done, we've---- a lot of our work, the majority of
our work was doing hospitals. Because x-rays, x-ray film, when they take an x-ray of your body,
you know, the x-ray film, you know, actually it's got silver in it. So a lot of our silver come from
the hospitals. We will go to the hospitals, and we would take their x-rays, we'd take it back to the
shop. And then we had a wash plant, you know, where we washed the film, get the silver off.
And that's where we got a lot of our silver. We'd--- in fact, that's where we got most of our silver.
And then, like I said, when that market went up, you know, people started hawking, you know,
grandma's flatware, and and all that stuff. But the mar--- majority of it comes from from
industrial, and hospitals.
JG  8:57
Is silver considered a finite resource?
JP  9:01
A what? It's a precious metal.
JG  9:03
Are they still mining it?
JP  9:04
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's there's mines out there. For a while they closed them down because the
market dropped a lot with---- I mean so low that it wouldn't work, you know, refining. But now
that the markets up, now they're refining it.  Or actually you know, they're---- got mines going.
JG  9:25
So, you were talking about the process of working on the repairs in that shop. You mentioned
soldering. Can you just describe that process?
JP  9:34
Yeah, I mean, we get we get people that bring in like, punch bowls or something that's been
dropped and it's got a big dent in it. And so we take out the dents, and lot of times, some of the
pieces that we get are old pieces. They've been in the family for 150 years and now the silver's
worn off and they want to refin---- refurbished. So we strip it down, take it down to the base
metal, and then put new silver on it. Make it look new again. And that's basically you know----
like tea pots, coffee pots. We do all restoration, resilvering....
JG  10:16
Would people come in with their stories behind the punch bowl, "like oh, I had too much punch
and I dropped it"?
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JP  10:21
[Laughs]. You know, I've heard all kinds of stories. You know, we, we get some stories in here,
sometimes. But yeah, I mean, a lot of times, it'd be housekeepers, you know, they'd, uh, be
cleaning a piece and then they'll be cleaning, being--- be a little bit too aggressive. And might,
you know, tear off a piece and then they bring it in to us to fix it. A lot of times the handle'll fall
off. We have to reattach it.
KC  10:51
So after being at Buschemeyer's for seven years, what was next?
JP  10:55
Oh, I ain't worked there---- I mean, that was, that's when I first started. I mean, that was back in
1980, '81. And after---- and I'd worked with Buschemeyer's for like 18 years. And then they went
out of business. And so, Replacements bought all their inventory, all Buschemeyer's inventory.
So a couple guys came from here to Kentucky to pick up all their inventory. And I was still at
work at Buschemeyer's. They were bout, bout ready to close the doors. And the guy here, he
asked me what I did. For Buschemeyer's, I told him silversmith. He said, "Well, why don't you
come to Replacements in North Carolina, you know and be interviewed?" And I did. And that
was '98. So when I, I came here in '98, and I've been here ever since. They've been to me.
Company's a real good company to work for.
JG  12:05
And what was that transition like? Was it scale-wise a bigger environment?
JP  12:11
Me being from Kentucky all my life, it was scary. I mean, I came here by myself, you know. And
I had just went through a divorce, you know, and I'm--- I was looking for a change, you know. So
I came here. And it was, it was a--- it was really scary for the first year or so. And then after that,
you know, I mean, now---- I went, I left the company just a couple years ago, and went back to
Kentucky. I thought well, you know, I'll go back and see how things, you know.... And I tried, I
didn't like it. This was home. So I come back here. So I've been here. So, I've been working.
Now North Carolina is my home.
KC  12:47
When you left did you leave to find more silver work in Kentucky?
JP  12:51
No, I kind of like wanted to retire.
KC  12:53
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
Yeah.
JP  12:54
My kids was getting older, and my kids are still in Kentucky. And they're older. And I just
wanted to go and you know, go back to Kentucky, and you know, try to be with them. See my
grandkids, spend some time with grandkids. And it's like, I get back, you know, and they're all
grown up, my kids are all grown, and they got their own lives. And I'm thinking, well, I was
seeing them just as much when I was in North Carolina, as I was, you know, now. You know,
being back in Kentucky. So I came back, you know, I just thought well, I mean, I'll come back.
You know, I'll go to Kentucky and visit like four or five times a year. And that's all I need.
KC  13:37
Did you go to college?
JP  13:38
No.
KC  13:39
So your education is totally in silver?
JP  13:43
Yeah, most--- you know, all of it was. Yeah, my education, I don't think I could have got a better
college education. Because I mean, you know, I talk to people that goes  to college all the time.
You know, and they don't know nothing, you know. But I had hands on training, you know, with
the apprentices that, being an apprentice. And so yeah, I mean, I worked with the, like I said, I've
worked with jewelry, you know, refining, you know, purifying silver, making bars, and pretty
much... If it's got anything to do with silver I know pretty much everything there is to know
about silver.
KC  14:18
Have you had apprentices?
JP  14:20
I've got like, maybe about eight or nine in there now. You know, and they're, you know---- that
I've trained over the years. When I came here in '98, they didn't have a silversmith. And I pretty
much trained all these people. You know, they've got some good talent in there now. You know, I
mean, these---- like I've said, I've been here like 22 years, 23 years, and we got some talent that's
been working under me that whole time. So they're---- we got some good guys in there. It's really
good.
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  14:55
What do you think it takes to be good at this work?
JP  14:59
Detail, you know, and---- pretty much I mean, after a while, you know, you get, you learn what,
you know what the customer expects. You know, when you're working on a customer piece. And
you know, after you've been doing it for 40 years, you know, you pretty much know what a piece
is supposed to look like. I mean, they bring pieces in, it's totally wiped out and destroyed, you
know. And you just try to reconstruct it and make it look good. You know? And, you know, we I
mean---- we, we get good reviews from customers.
KC  15:30
Pretending it's not COVID do you have customer interactions directly at Replacements? Are you
more sort of....
JP  15:41
No we go when the, when the, you know, when it's---- before all this started, you know, we had
the showroom open, and people could bring in restoration work.  We would go and give prices.
Yeah, we talk to customers all the time in the showroom.
KC  16:02
And maybe walk us through a little bit of the actual work at hand, like, explain the process of
taking out a dent. And, you know, with respect to not divulging trade secrets, but giving more of
us a sense of the act of labor.
JP  16:24
We do so many, we do 1000s of restoration pieces a year. You know, and, you know, walking
through one piece... I mean, for instance, you know, if they bring a teapot in with it, we've got
special tools in there to take dents out. Of teapots. And there's a lot of times when----  I mean,
over the years, I mean, we've got tools, I mean, we've got a lot of tools. In some cases, you know,
we don't have a tool. So we have to make the tool.
KC  16:58
And are you are you involved in that kind of.... development?
JP  17:00
Yeah, we do. Yeah, we pretty much do everything. You know, I mean, if, you know if we we----
if we they bring something in, you know, like a trumpet or something like that, that needs to be
repaired or something..... And then and then the handle, it's got a dent in it. So we have to make a
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
tool to go, go up in that and pull that dent out. You know, so if we don't have that tool, we'll
make one. So we make a lot of tools in there too.
JG  17:25
Did I see in a video that you also can fabricate reproductions of certain things?
JP  17:32
Yeah. I mean, can you be more specific?
JG  17:36
I think I saw a video of a spoon being---- like a slotted spoon that was....
JP  17:40
Yeah, I mean, if you know, there would be a lot of times a lot of umm---- and we do a lot of that
too, conversion pieces. People need a slotted spoon and they don't have a slotted spoonn, they'll,
they'll bring or they'll call and they'll order the spoon from us. A tablespoon. And we'll, we'll cut
because we got to waterjet that we can cut certain pieces out with that waterjet. So yeah, we do
manufacturing of pieces too.
JG  18:08
I'm curious, so you came to Replacements. And there was no silversmith, you're the first one....
JP  18:14
They, yeah, they had a couple guys in there that did---- because the company is not that old, you
know. So yeah, they didn't, they didn't have silversmith. And yeah, they they had a couple guys
doing, like minor restoration, you know, and stuff like that. They didn't have anybody doing
soldering, doing plating. And I pretty much brung that to the company.
JG  18:41
So you got the opportunity to build the shop up?
JP  18:44
Yeah, I mean, it was---- it's been fun. Well, yeah and the supervisors, you know, I mean, they,
you know---- I'd tell them what I needed, and they always gave it to me. So, yeah, we've, we've
built a good, you know, restoration department in there.
JG  18:58
Are there tools and technology that are different from when you started in the 80s? Did they have
waterjet back then?
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JP  19:06
No, they're doing stuff in there and you know, with the waterjet and the lasers that just blew
my---- I mean, you know, I mean, I'm still I mean.... that you can't do, I mean. You know, we got
lasers in there. They're, you know, they, you know, they're really---- I don't know what the word
is, but they're really good about conversion pieces. Which I didn't do that many conversions. You
know, all's I done was restoration work when I came here. And then they, the supervisors, you
know, they started experimenting, conversions and stuff like that. And now, that's a big part of
the business now is the restoration. I mean, the conversions
KC  19:12
And how do you feel about the state of being a silversmith in general, like the fact that you say
you've got eight or nine people learning the trade?
JP  20:02
Well, I mean, I consider us all restoration specialists. Silversmith, you know. And restoration
specialist because that's what we do mainly is restoration. I mean, we can, you know---- the
majority of our work, a lot of silversmith they make and manufacturer, you know, pieces. But we
might we mainly do restoration. And that's what we do. And that's what we're good at, you know,
is restoring pieces.
KC  20:31
Do the people who come to you to work, do they bring training and education with them? Or is
it.....
JP  20:38
Most of them, you know, they've learned here being at the company. I mean, so we've got, there's
a couple guys I worked with, in there now that's been in here---- I mean, I came in '98, 22 years
ago, 23 years ago, and we've got a couple apprentices in there, that's been in there for 20 years.
And they're really good.
JG  20:59
So the business is healthy. Have you seen the types of things you're taking in change over the
years?
JP  21:09
As far as restoration no, it's pretty much the same. I mean we get it all, you know, we get, you
know, damaged trays, you know, or dented trays, or, you know, dented teapots and stuff like that.
And you know it's pretty much the same, you know, all this restoration. I've seen pretty much
everything that needs to be restored at one time or the other. You know, but no, I mean, it's all
pretty much the same.
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  21:33
It's interesting, because in some other repair industries, we've noticed that there's been a decline
in, in, just in the business, but it's interesting that people still value and bring these objects in for
repair.
JP  21:49
Yeah, that's really surprising, because I, you know, I think, you know, over the last couple years
that we we're getting busier. You know, which is good. You know, a lot of the smaller companies,
because Replacements Limited is a big company. You know, I don't know if you're familiar with,
you know, anybody else doing what, what we do here. But uh, naw but all the smaller companies
like the ones I--- that I used to work for, you know, they're, you know, they're, they're all out of
business. So now, that's why, you know, when somebody goes out of business, you know, now
they're starting to send stuff to us, that's why we stay busy.
KC  22:23
Would you still encourage a young person to become a silversmith, because they'd always have
the job? Like Rob did for you?
JP  22:32
Yeah, I mean.... yeah, but I mean, it's, it takes a lot of work, though. You know, you got to be,
you know, be pretty dedicated. You know, and working all the time, you know, a lot of these
young people they don't, they really don't want to work. So, yeah, I mean, if I see somebody
that's really, you know, eager and willing to learn, yeah. I would advise them to be a silversmith.
KC  22:58
What do you enjoy about this profession?
JP  23:02
Pretty much the people I work for, and the people I work with, you know. It's been a joy, you
know, working for this company. I mean, you know, they, they pretty much brought me here,
they didn't have too many--- you know, they didn't have nobody doing the silver restoration that I
was doing. So they pretty much let me, you know, do and grow and teach them you know. How
to become, you know, silversmiths. So, I, you know, I love the company. I mean, it's a good
company to work for.
KC  23:37
Is there an achievement, or a project that you're especially proud of?
JP  23:42
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
I've done work for, I mean, I mean, you know, there's over the years, you know, I've done work
for, you know, celebrities. And, and, done other--- there was a lady I will mention, she called
and, you know, and everything in her house was destroyed, house. And the only thing she had
left---- her husband had passed away. And I don't think he was, he died in the fire, but he, he had
passed away. I think a year or two before the fire. And so everything was destroyed, except for
she had an old baby cup that was his. And she sent it to us to see, you know, if we could do
anything with it. I didn't know the story at the time. And it was I mean, it was pretty much gone,
you know, and she asked me, you know, I mean, when we told her, you know, that it can't be
restored she said, you know, "I mean that's the only thing I have left of my husband and could
you do something with it?" So I mean, we took, well it took a lot of work and we restored that
cup and that was one of the more prouder things that I did. You know, 'cause she had call, called
back and she left a message. It was, message was left on the weekend and she was crying about
how good of a job that we done on her husband's cup. But normally, if it's, you know, if it's
destroyed, you know, it would cost more than--- but just the story about it. You know, we went
ahead and done it for this lady. And she was really thrilled. So that's one of the the better stories.
I mean, well, I've got a ton of stories, but that was....
KC  25:18
Give us another one.
JP  25:22
Well, I mean, we, you know, I mean with the, the Hurricane Katrina, the one down in the
[inaudible]. I mean, we got pictures of people sending tea sets in, you know. And it was, and
they've been--- it was a family heirloom. We told them, you know, that it was destroyed. Can't
be--- so we restored that. And they were really proud of that, so.
KC  25:49
Is there---- I imagine you must have to know about the history of when these things were
produced? Was there like a boon time for silver home accessories that a lot of these objects kind
of originate from, like a certain---- like when was it in vogue?
JP  26:14
Some of the most interesting pieces are around turn of the century, you know. The older pieces,
that's one, that's what I like. But I mean, now, the majority of the pieces are just crap. You know,
they're just junk. You know, they're flash plated, you know, they just manufacture 'em in
numbers. Flash plate 'em, and then send them out. You know, but they don't make silver like they
used to back in the '40s, '30s. You know, that was when it was really good quality stuff around
the turn of the century too. You know, that's uh, but most of that stuff was plated back then.
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  26:51
Are you a collector?
JP  26:53
I used to be at one time.
JG  26:55
What did you like to collect?
JP  26:56
Oh, gosh, I collected everything silver. I mean, I'd go out to flea markets and find silver, old junk
silver and restore it.
JG  27:08
Re-sell?
JP  27:09
Pardon?
JG  27:09
To re-sell?
JP  27:10
Yeah, some of it I resold and some [inaudible] I'd just put away. And then over the years, I just
got rid of it. I thought then I was gonna do something with it someday and then never did. So I
went ahead and sold it, especially when the market went up.
JG  27:25
We like to ask people if they have any other creative hobbies that they like to do. That's kind of a
hobby to go to flea markets and collect silver. Are there any other outlets you have in that area?
JP  27:38
Naw, I'm stupid with everything else.  The only thing I know is silver. I mean, I've done silver
my whole life, you know, ever since I got out of high school. And that's all I know. So no, I don't
have no hobbies, you know.
KC  27:54
How do you like working with your hands? I mean, it's like a hard question, because it's all
you've ever done, but....
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JP  28:00
It's all I know. Yeah, yeah working with my hands. Yeah, that's all I know. I couldn't imagine
doing anything else though. I started so young. I couldn't imagine being anything but a
silversmith. I enjoy it. And it's ah, given me a good life.
KC  28:23
Any advice for any young prospective silvermiss---- silversmiths?
JP  28:33
No, I mean, if you like it, you know. If you know, if you enjoy, you know, being---- cleaning
silver and stuff like that, you know, it's.... you know, that's the down part about being a
silversmith, you know, 'cause you got a lot of, you know, cleaning silver and prepping silver and
getting it ready and all that, you know. I mean, that's the down part about, you know, being a
silversmith is just cleaning pieces to get it prepped and be read--- you know, plated and all that.
That's the down part of being a silversmith.
KC  29:03
And the glory part of being a silversmith is, like, listening to that voicemail from the woman.
JP  29:10
Yeah, you know, and, you know, a lot of people, you know, we get a lot of respect. You know,
silversmiths. Because I mean, especially with people like that, you know. That they don't think
there's anybody else that can do those, you know, that work anymore? Because there's not very
many silversmiths. And, you know, so it's satisfying to know that these people do appreciate ya.
KC  29:33
And are you finding that you're still learning new skills?
JP  29:36
Oh, yeah, you learn stuff every day, you know? Now, you know, I've been doing it so long I
mean, it's few and far between. But the things that I am learning is that, you know, is you
know---- like the conversion pieces, you know. 'Cause we get all these new equipment come in,
you know, with the lasers, the waterjet, you know, they didn't have that stuff back in 1980. You
know, and see that the stuff that--- these, these things put out, you know, it makes you wonder.
You know what I mean? What's it going to be in another 100 years, you know?
KC  30:10
And conversion actually means like, replicating from nothing?
JP  30:14
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
No, um, we replicate.... Conversion means, you know, if we take a, like a knife, you know. Just a
basic knife, you know, and somebody don't have a soup ladle. So we can take that knife blade out
and put the soup ladle in and laser it in, and you can't even tell.
KC  30:35
Gotcha.
JP  30:36
You know, not all, you know, soup ladles. You know and other pieces as well, you know, soup
labels. We've got like, 50 different pieces that we can do.
KC  30:52
Do you find yourself having to do historical research to like know how, you know, that
manufacturer would have done that curve? Or detail? Or do you have so much information right
here that you don't really need to be detectives?
JP  31:06
We've got, yeah we've got---- the research department in there can pretty much find out anything
that you need. So you know, there's a lot of people that---- there's 400 people that work there. So
if we need, if we, if we don't have the information, they can usually find it.
JG  31:21
You can see why it's hard for the little guys to keep up in a way.
JP  31:25
Yeah.
JG  31:25
You have all these incredible resources.
JP  31:26
Yeah, cause they got a lot of research, you know, that, you know.... We do a lot of work, you
know, we do a lot of--- we've got some pretty skilled people in there.
JG  31:27
Do you--- do you keep an archive of the repairs you do?
JP  31:45
Over 40 years [inaudible]. I mean....
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  31:47
It'd be like....
JP  31:48
Yeah, I mean, I---- you know, they take photos all the time in there. And if something comes in,
you know, and it's really, really bad I've got pictures on my phone. Some pieces that came in in a
fire, you know, that I restored.  And, so yeah, we do---- I mean, if it's a really bad piece, you
know, we'll, we'll take pictures of it, and then we'll archive it. Use it for PR or whenever
KC  32:18
You know it's interesting, we've talked to some repair people who are able to leave, like a mark
on, you know, the inside of a big upright bass or sign inside of a chimney that they've plastered,
but your job is to have your hand be completely invisible, basically. Except, you know, you
restore it to perfection, but you can't really like put your personal mark on it.
JP  32:45
Not, not notice---- not nowhere it's going to be noticed. You can put your own personal marking
on the inside. But if you don't make the piece, you know I don't see the point in that. You know,
you can't take the [inaudible] for somebody else's work. I mean, it's like patent infringement or
something like that. You don't want to do that.
KC  33:08
We---- this is another question we always, we like to hear people's different answers. Do you
have a favorite tool?
JP  33:18
Probably a torch. You know, we do a lot of soldering in there. You know. And without that, you
know, we can't, we can't do our job without a torch. You know, it's where we do all the soldering.
You know, if something's broke off---- a tea.... I mean like, something broke off like a lead or
something like that. It has to be soldiered. We can't we can't do our job without you know,
without a torch. No silversmith can. So that's, that's what we need.
JG  33:55
Essential piece of equipment.
JP  33:57
Yeah.
KC  34:00
Any other questions?
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
JG  34:07
One just escaped my brain. Is there anything, any other stories or any other parts of your job that
you would like to share that we haven't covered?
JP  34:15
No, that's pretty much it. I mean, I pretty much told you my whole life story. But yeah, I mean, I
you know, over the years, I've had a lot of fun. In learning the craft and teaching the craft. I'm
hoping to have another few more years and then....
KC  34:32
Yeah I think you're the, you're the person with the m--- who's taught the most, I think that we've
talked with. And the fact that you've nine folks in your shop.
JP  34:42
You've mean in silver? Yeah.
JG  34:44
In general.
JP  34:45
Yeah, I mean, there's---- there's no other silver company like ours now. You know, and now, all
of them like I said, most of the smaller ones, you had two or three. And they all---- you know
most of, the most of the old, the guys who got older over the years and retired, and they didn't
teach nobody, nobody come behind them. You know, you might see, you might, you might find,
you know, 10-15 around the country, silversmiths, that actually....
KC  35:15
Do you talk to each other?
JP  35:16
Nuh uh.
JG  35:19
Why not?
JP  35:20
Well, I mean, I---- you know, I don't know. I mean, not that I have anything against them. I just
can't learn anything from 'em. You know. I tried to talk to one a few years back, and he was kind
of offended. But, but I, you know, I didn't have---- it's like I don't know, he was like, he had a
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
problem. He was, I don't know, he just didn't like---- he didn't, for one he didn't like, the
company [Replacements]. Didn't like the size of the company. And I don't think this guy's in
business anymore.
KC  35:54
Yeah.
JP  35:54
You know, a lot of them, you know, they, they, they see us doing so much business.
KC  35:59
Right.
JP  36:00
That you know, they don't want to really have any contact with us.
KC  36:05
And obviously, the size of the company, is what enables you to have so many apprentices
because some of the shops that we've talked to, you know, they earn money over their expertise.
So they don't really want to share it unless you stick with them forever.
JP  36:23
And that's what they---- when I first came to this company, the guy that I came here, he was a
supplier, you know. And he said, John, if you go there, don't teach them everything, you know.
You know, and which---- I think I messed up [laughs]. These guys already know. Over 20 years,
you know, they figure everything out. And I'm glad I did.
JG  36:24
Well t seems important to keep that knowledge.
JP  36:47
Yeah, they, they were yeah---- they were afraid for themselves.
JG  36:50
Right.
JP  36:50
You know, secure their jobs. But I mean, now, you know, we got--- I'm glad I did, what I did.
afc2020009_002--John Probus interview conducted by Katy Clune and Julia Gartrell
KC  37:02
Well, thank you for chatting with us.
JP  37:03
It's okay.
JG  37:04
Yeah, thank you so much.
JP  37:05
I hope you all got something from it.
JG  37:08
Absolutely.
KC  37:08
We-- yeah.
JG  37:10
It's really interesting.
KC  37:11
I'll turn off the tape.
