Interview with Beacham McDougald, afc2016037_04022 
July 12, 2017 
Interviewed at the Laurinburg Chamber of Commerce in Laurinburg, North Carolina, 
by Sarah Bryan and Will Bryan for Folklife of the Funeral Services Profession 
Beacham McDougald: Okay. To start, just a little family history. My great¬ 
grandfather, M. A. McDougald, better known as "Ma'com"1 — even though his name 
was Malcolm, people called him Ma'com —born in 1827 here in North Carolina. And in 
the little community of Antioch, which is between Red Springs and Raeford, was where 
he was living. And I know as early as 1856 there was a retail establishment there known 
as McDougald and Currie. And it specialized in hardware, furniture, and undertaking. 
At the outbreak of the Civil War, the business probably dissolved, and he became a 
soldier in the Confederate Army. He was married, he had a son who died in 1856 of 
snakebite — and that was Peter. He had a daughter, Annie, and had one other son. Will. 
And then in the Civil War, I know by his records, he went as far south as Summerville, 
South Carolina, and as far north as Saint Petersburg [Petersburg], Virginia. After the 
War, or just prior to the end of the War, the railyards were moved from Wilmington to 
Laurinburg, in hopes of preventing them from being ravaged by the Yankees, or the 
Union forces. And in 1865 when the War ended, he moved his family from Antioch to 
Laurinburg, because the railroad was looking for men skilled in cabinetmaking, and 
that was his skill. And he joined the railroad company when they built railcars and so 
forth, and his cabinetmaking skills were really highly prized. And one of his coworkers 
was Edwin Buchanan, and ironically, Edwin Buchanan ended up marrying his 
daughter Annie. And along the way he had a son, Dan, who was born—his name was 
Daniel Archibald—and then in 1870, my grandfather, Malcolm John, or better known as 
John to him. Papa to everybody else in the family. And Papa did not do like his brothers 
Will and Dan. He went off to the railroad, and became a railroad engineer. Will and 
Dan talked my great-grandfather Ma'com, "Let's get back into retail business." So they 
built a store in what was then downtown Laurinburg, and started a furniture, 
hardware, and undertaking company. Ma'com could build the coffins, and Will and 
Dan could as well. Dan was more of the personality of the group. He was an actor, he 
played in local vaudeville productions and local theater, called the Laurinburg Opry, or 
Opera House. And they started the company and just called it M. A. McDougald. Near 
the end of the nineteenth century, there was a fire that totally wiped out downtown 
Laurinburg. All of the buildings were made of wood, and once the fire started, there 
was no stopping. And the company moved to the north side of the railroad tracks into 
temporary building, and they started making plans for the next thing. So in 1903, they 
started building a building at the corner of Main and Railroad Streets here in 
Laurinburg. It was a beautiful three-story structure that is currently being renovated. 
1 Malcolm McDougald's first name was pronounced "Ma'com" — like Macon, as in 
Macon, Georgia, except for the last letter. 
[00:05:00] And it'll be kind of ironic that an old undertaking parlor and furniture 
store is going to be reborn as a brewpub. But I think they would approve. During those 
early days, funerals were, in the rural areas of North Carolina, were probably quite a bit 
different than the urban areas. People were more spread apart, and when a death 
occurred—you've got to remember, this is late nineteenth century—there were no 
official recordings. There were no death certificates. Somebody might mention in a 
newspaper article—and we did have a newspaper that was a once-a-week publication, 
and they would mention that someone died, and if it was someone known by the editor 
and writer, Mr. O. L. Moore, he had a flowery way with words that could really bring 
an obituary alive. And the old Laurinburg Exchange, which was the newspaper from 
that era, I just love to find them on microfilm and read some of the stories, just because 
of the language they used in those times. Ah, but as death customs occurred —we did 
not have a hospital, and people would always, either they'd die maybe in an accident, 
they'd pass, or they would die at home in the care of the family. And at that time, 
undertaking was basically, "Well, you bring us two pieces of string" — and everybody 
knew. The family would come in with a string, which was the width of the shoulders, 
and another string which was the length of the body from the head to the toes. And M. 
A. would go and build a coffin to fit, and the family would take the coffin. They would 
probably go to a church or family cemetery, some friend of the family would do the 
rest. Funeral was held, and that was it. It became the custom in those days that a person 
that died at home, their body did not leave the house until it was taken to the cemetery 
to be buried. So, in the wintertime you could say that there was more time for people to 
wait, because of the cold weather, than there was in the summer — which, you would 
probably want to have everything done and completed in 24 hours. During the early 
parts of the twentieth century, we started getting caskets from casket companies, and 
the focus shifted from building caskets to caskets coming in, and since we also had 
furniture and did upholstery and stuff like that, my grandfather and my father and my 
great-uncles all remembered lining the caskets. The caskets they would receive were 
just boxes, and they were all different sizes and lengths. Strikingly, a lot of the caskets in 
those days were children's caskets, because childhood deaths were very common. We 
had two hearses, horse-drawn hearses: one full-size one was black, and it was for 
adults; another one, almost full-size, was white, and it was used for all the children. 
Gradually over time, that tradition changed and the white hearse went by the wayside, 
and everybody preferred the black hearse, because it seemed to be mourning, 
regardless of whichever way, rather than the purity symbolized by white for children. 
And in 1909, my great-grandfather, Ma'com, M. A., he died, and at that time, the three 
brothers—Will, Dan, and John—decided, there's this thing that's becoming more 
popular called embalming. 
[0:10:15] So John being the youngest, they elected him — even though he was 40 
years old —"You're going to Cincinnati, and you're going to learn how to embalm." So 
he went to Cincinnati School of Embalming in 1910, and at that time it was a six-week 
course. And he finished it, came back, and became the first licensed embalmer in a large 
area around here. I was told stories that funeral homes from 25, 30 miles away would — 
if a family needed a delay—they would take a body and place it on the train that was 
coming to Laurinburg, and since the funeral home was probably 100 feet from the 
railroad track, we always knew when the train arrived, and they knew that we needed 
to come get a body off the train. So it would be taken up to the embalming room on the 
third floor, where the preparation work was done, and then shipped back to the funeral 
home on the next trip. Papa, or my grandfather John, was the embalmer, so his part 
mainly was embalming. And he recalled a lot of stories where it was just—he would go 
to work sometimes, and never hardly get home. But he had a family of nine children, 
and one niece that they adopted after her parents died. 
The flu epidemic of 1918 was truly a defining moment in Scotland County; and I 
discovered this by accident, I had never heard of it. When I was in college I was doing a 
college research paper on World War I, and I went back to old newspapers, and I was 
pulling them out and reading them, and there would be letters that were sent home 
from the soldiers overseas that described the conditions on the battlefield. And my 
research paper basically was about the soldiers and the people back home, not the big 
events or the strategies of the war. And then when I started getting toward October, I 
started noticing something. They called it the Spanish flu. They called it the gripe. 
Stories indicated that it came into America through the ports — Charleston, Wilmington, 
Norfolk, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Boston—and it was brought by people 
returning from overseas, where it had supposedly started in Europe. October was the 
peak month here in Scotland County. Records don't exist, but the oral history from my 
grandfather to my father was that he knowingly knew that over 200 people died in the 
month of October 1918, most from the flu. During that time, he embalmed almost 80. 
The rest of the time it was just, you know, "WeTl sell you a casket. You'll have to do it." 
Even today those kinds of numbers in Scotland County would devastate anyone. But 
you've got to remember, back then Scotland County probably had a population of 
about six or 7,000 people. So everybody knew someone who had it. The one thing I even 
noticed in studying, there was a man that lived up north of Laurinburg—you know 
when you're going back home, where you stop at the stop sign, the house just to the 
left—his name was Joe Ward. And Joe passed of the flu. He was a very prominent 
person. And his wife. Miss Jeannie, was pregnant. 
[00:15:00] A daughter was born. She is Jeannie Ward Nadeau, and she is still alive. I 
talked to her last fall. She's a wonderful lady. But, you know, she lives now in the 
Winston-Salem area, where her children are. But it's just interesting, I would talk— 
When I heard about Joe Ward, I said, "I know that family." I went and talked to them, 
and they gave me more clues to look out. And there was a Gilchrist farm, and they were 
very prominent farmers. And the sharecroppers that lived with them, the African 
Americans, were also black and Gilchrists. And the story was they sent the black 
Gilchrist family in to select a casket, to have their loved one embalmed, and the white 
Gilchrist family was going to pay for everything. So, we talk about the segregation that 
occurred in those days; there was still a lot of, I like to say, human compassion, where 
people cared for one another. And that proved to be a good illustration. 
As the end of October came in this area, um — Well, to get there, let me jump back. You 
know back in those days, people did not shower or bathe daily like they do today, but 
they did change clothes. My grandfather at one point, in October, recalled [text message 
chime] that he went over a week without changing clothes or bathing because he was so 
busy. (Laughs) I can't imagine that today! Well, November rolled around, and the flu 
deaths began to diminish. And what happened, the flu was gradually moving 
westward in the United States, and if you watch that trend, it just kept spreading west. 
Some people had it later. And the end of World War I came on November 11, but it was 
hardly noticed here, because the flu had pretty much ended. We lost more people in the 
flu than we lost in World War I. Seeing the flu go was the big change. 
The early '20s— Well, let me see, no. In 1914, before the flu epidemic, my grandfather 
and his brothers decided they were going to advance a little bit, and they ordered a 
motorized hearse to replace the horse-drawn. Well, that's like saying, "I'm going to put 
in a crematorium because I'm going to replace ground burial," or embalming and 
burial. There were still some people that preferred the horse-drawn hearse. "Hey, but 
we got this one that doesn't need a horse!" "We still want the horse-drawn, it's 
tradition." So from 1914 for the next, I think, five to ten years, there was an option with 
more people going to the horse-drawn — I mean the motorized hearse. Motorized hearse 
had to be replaced very frequently. It seems like mechanics were not like what they are 
today, where you can drive a ten-year-old car. Back in those days, when you had a 
three- or four-year-old car, it was probably getting ready to fall apart. But it became 
what is known, as what my grandfather said, the second motorized hearse in the state 
of North Carolina. The first one, they were all sent down from Ohio or Michigan, 
wherever it was, Illinois, and it was on a train, and the train stopped in Winston-Salem 
and left one at Vogler and Son Funeral Home first, and the next day brought it to us, so 
we got the second one. (Laughs) 
[0:19:55] Funerals at that time were still done primarily in the home. A story I 
wrote, "The Way It Was: 1933," which I took from a story — The old McNeil home, 
which is up in the Sandhills, someone passed there. My father and Papa got up in the 
middle of the night and drove a vehicle with a casket on it — back then the caskets were 
pretty much all the same size, and they knew the family—to the house, and there they 
began the embalming process. The family was deciding that, well, we've got to have the 
funeral at such-and-such day, because So-and-So has got to get here from this town, or 
so-and-so. And if you think back in the '20s, that's when they really started paving 
roads, but most of the rural roads around this area were still dirt roads. Transportation 
was by rail. And the closest railroad to the McNeil house was probably 12 miles away, 
but once you arrived at your destination—you've got to remember, in those days more 
people had horse-drawn wagons than they had cars. So the funeral was delayed about 
four or five days for the family to get in. But the decedent was embalmed at the house. 
Once the embalming was done, there were friends of the family that went in, and the 
women would dress the women, and the men would dress the men. That was just 
tradition. And the funeral home, everybody talks about years ago, you can borrow a 
chair from the funeral homes; funeral homes were required to have a lot of folding 
chairs, because when a funeral was held in the house, people had to have a place to sit. 
And you wonder — funeral home fans? Yeah, in the hot summertime, okay. They don't 
have air conditioning, much less electricity. It's hot, so let's have some fans. So, I always 
say, there's a reason funeral homes were notorious for having folding chairs and funeral 
home fans. And that began in the Deep South in the summers of the early years. 
And the interesting thing about Scotland County is that we are mostly in the Sandhills 
of North Carolina. Here in Laurinburg we're pretty much solid ground. We have clay, 
good topsoil. Someone once told me, said, "The worst thing about Laurinburg is that 
they built Laurinburg on top of the best soil in the region, and left the poor Sandhills for 
the farmers." Well, digging a grave in the Sandhills was always a trick, because sand 
doesn't hold, and you may dig a hole that seems to be the right size, and overnight the 
sides cave in, so you have to go back and dig it again. And my father recalled one time 
where he was telling the minister, he said, "Now, don't get close to the grave." And the 
minister said, "Well, I am going to place my hand on the casket." My father reminded 
him, said, "It's very dangerous." Well, the minister walked up to the edge of the grave, 
and the ground gave way, and he went down under the casket. So. (Laughs) Stories like 
that. I'm sure that shocked a lot of people at the time, but it happened. But you know, 
people in those days were more inclined to let things be, mistakes and learning 
experiences, than we are today. The funerals in those days were also always well- 
attended, because radio was in its infancy, television didn't exist, and the churches were 
the central gathering places. And everybody knew everybody by which church they 
went to. And churches were scattered throughout the rural areas of the countryside. 
[00:25:02] So when someone in church died, it was like the loss of an extended 
family member. People came together for it. And there was always the big feast, of 
food. And then over the years, as you know, we went through several things; we went 
through the Great Depression, where people had no money. And that was when we lost 
our beautiful three-story building, because it wasn't the funeral business that we lost 
the money on, it was everybody in those days bought furniture on credit, and we 
depended on them paying us in order to pay our bills If it came to the point that they 
couldn't pay us because they had no money, we couldn't pay, so we had to lose the 
facility. And we moved into a house next to the Scotland County courthouse, called the 
old Hammond House. And this was in 1933. We were there for five years, and in the 
meantime we built a nice new facility, which was a funeral home exclusively, about a 
block away, on [Beech?] Street. They moved into there in 1938. My grandfather was still 
living. My father was, had finished mortuary college, or embalming school as he called 
it, in 1935. My father's sister Tina, Christine, who was a few years older, she had been to 
college and learned bookkeeping skills, so she was the one that looked after the money. 
And there was always extra help to come in and help do whatever was needed. The one 
that I remember most, that came in in 1953, was Sam Mclnnis. He was like a second 
father to me. But I'll go back to the early days. World War II metal rationing meant, 
obviously, metal caskets were not popular at that time, so there were no metal caskets. 
There were no metal vaults anymore. Everything had to be done with the use of as little 
metal as possible. So it became a different trick during World War II. And there would 
be telegrams — and I collect, I have some of them stored away somewhere—when a local 
person was killed overseas, we would receive a telegram from the military, US Army, 
Navy, or whatever branch of service, that the body of — and they'd list the person—will 
arrive at what port, and be put on a train, and should be in Laurinburg at such-and- 
such a date, which was, I notice, to get the body from the train. And, of course there 
were—sometimes every body wasn't returned, because if you go to France where the D- 
Day invasion occurred, all they had time to do then was bury them on the spot. But 
there were those that were brought back. [Clears throat] My father said that World War 
II was a very trying time, because we had just come through the Great Depression, and 
we entered the war, and some of our finest young men here in the community died in 
World War II. World War II was not, by any means of the word, the poor man's war. 
Everybody, regardless of their status in life, as long as they were physically able, 
fought. My father was crippled with polio when he was 18 months old, so he was not 
eligible for the military. Two of his brothers, they were railroad engineers, so they 
needed them here in the country shipping munitions. And he had an older brother who 
was a veteran. And he went to Europe. 
[0:30:10] After World War II, funerals changed more to — well, I would say before 
World War II—1938, my father said, was the last year my father said he embalmed a 
body at home. And after that, all the embalmings were done at the new funeral home, 
which had a designated embalming room. And nearly everybody that passed was 
embalmed. They were placed in a casket. At that time most of the caskets were made of 
wood, and had a felt covering over them. And as the war ended metal became 
available, and more people started opting for metal caskets. There were still some cloth- 
covered woods, but metal seemed to be the preferred trend. And a very few people 
started wanting something made out of some wood like oak, or pine, just because they 
liked that wood. But it was rare. And burial vault use came into being. When I started, 
most of our funerals were, you take the person, you put them inside of a wooden—put 
the casket inside a wooden box, put the lid on the wooden box, and cover it up. It was 
mainly just because people didn't want to see dirt thrown on Mama's casket. But you 
knew that just a few years later the wooden box was going to give away and the grave 
was going to sink. I went to many a cemetery refilling graves after a few years. (Laughs) 
But anyway, growing up in it, it was interesting, because we not only had a funeral 
home, but because a hearse had a large back-end, that funeral homes started being 
called on to provide ambulance service. So the hearse could have a red light put on the 
roof, and it became either a convalescent or an emergency. And somewhere in the 
1950s, Scotland County started a rescue squad, and the rescue squad was all volunteers, 
and they took an old bread truck and rebuilt the inside to hold the equipment they 
needed, and the rescue squad cooperated along with our ambulance service to get to 
wherever they needed to go, whether it was a wreck or anything like that. And 
fortunately, in 1968, the county—the state of North Carolina made new regulations for 
ambulance service, so we were able to get rid of the ambulance service, which was 
never making money. I can remember at that time an ambulance trip — I mean, picking 
up somebody at home here in Scotland County, I mean in Laurinburg, and taking them 
to the hospital, was five dollars. If they lived in the county it was ten dollars. But you've 
got to remember, in the 1960s five and ten dollars were a lot more money than they are 
now. It was quite a bit different. But it was good. I got my driver's license in the 1960s. I 
never drove the ambulance, but I was put in charge of getting graves dug, putting up 
tents and things of that nature. I was 15 years old when I dug my first grave, and I think 
I was probably in my thirties when I dug my last grave—all by hand. So. (Laughs) My 
father was one of the people that, he told me if I was going to get into this business, and 
I wasn't sure I really wanted to, he said, "I'm'on give you a business job where you start 
at the top and you end at the bottom." I'm sitting here thinking, "That doesn't sound 
too attractive. What is that?" "Digging a grave." So I was taken out in the country 
where a grave was going to be dug, and they marked off the three-by-eight space, and 
they said, "Now, when you turn the shovel upside-down, and it comes up this high on 
the blade of the shovel, you've dug it deep enough." And all the dirt had to go on one 
side. It was easy digging at first, because most of the place was topsoil, and topsoil 
wasn't hard. But then you hit clay. And that's what the pickaxe was for. It was a whole 
lot easier digging in the winter, when you broke a sweat you were cooled down, than in 
the summer where there's nothing to do but get hot and sweaty. 
[0:35:50] Uh, I don't know why I stuck with it! I went off to college and I said, no, 
everything I knew about funeral service was hard, grueling work, long hours; and my 
initial experience in college, I said, "I'm going to major in chemistry and go to 
pharmacy school." And I was interrupted, 1973, my mother fell ill, and my dad asked if 
I would please take a sabbatical—I was finished with my junior year of college—stop, 
come home, and serve my apprenticeship, take another year, go off to mortuary college, 
and get a license, and then go off to college. Well, for love of family, I did. My mother 
had heart valve replacement. While I was home she had a very difficult struggle. You 
think, in 1974, heart surgery was not what it is today. And I went off to mortuary 
college in September of '74. She died in October of '74. Ah, my life was shattered. I was 
a lot closer to my mother than I was to my father. Ah, I went back and I finished 
mortuary college just on will alone, not desire to be in mortuary college. It was a 
difficult decision. When I got out I passed the national board, was licensed by the state, 
and I became the person in the embalming room, where my dad finally [?] that to me 
and he ran the front. Um, I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do. It was difficult because 
my mother was always the one to go to for information, for support, for guidance. And 
I decided, "No, I don't want to do this. I want to do something else." So I returned to St. 
Andrews University, which is here in Laurinburg, as a part-time student, and thought I 
would continue chemistry. But when you take two years off of chemistry, you forget so 
much—kind of like, you know, if you don't speak Spanish regularly, you lose it. So I 
said, well, my next love, I always enjoyed listening to my father and others talk about 
history. So I changed my major to history. And two years at St. Andrews was a 
wonderful experience, and it was during that time that, doing the research for papers 
and everything, I said, "I'm clear in my mind, and I'm going to be in funeral service." 
So that's when I started. And there was a 40-year-gap between me and my father, and I 
started seeing some things that people were telling me that were different than the 
values he had. And I finally sat down with him, I said, "Pa, we need to make some 
changes." Well, he —"Well, this has always worked this way." I said, "Give me a 
chance." And we started making some gradual changes in the way things were done, 
and they were well received. And it was such as upgrading the funeral home facility; it 
wasn't going to be a drab-looking facility, like the days when black was the 
predominant color. This was just, everything was a drab earth-tone color. 
[00:39:57] I said, "We're going to add some color. We're going to start offering a little 
better things than these ways. We're going to have different cars. We're going to 
upgrade a lot of things." And it turned out to be successful. And I remember in 1982 he 
said, "You just take control of it." He also gave me 24 percent of the business, and he 
kept full control, but he gave me the freedom to do things. And at that time, cremation 
was starting to creep in. And I kept saying, you know, "There's some people out there 
want cremation, and it's not enough yet to afford a crematorium," but he was deadly 
opposed to cremation. It was just not right. So we always used somebody else for 
cremation. And our business started growing. And then when my aunt had passed, that 
did the bookkeeping, passed in '77,1 became the bookkeeper, and at that time, before 
computers, you opened up a general ledger and you recorded everything by hand. I felt 
like I should have been a CPA. But not only was I embalming, waiting on families, 
keeping books, but also found, there's no time off. Got married in 1980, and I basically 
told them, I said, "I've got to have some time off sometimes. My wife and I want to go 
some places." And things started changing, but I still felt like if I wasn't there at the 
funeral home working, I was not approving what he wanted me to do. So I stayed, 
probably worked I would say average 60 to 70 hours a week. And when my father died, 
it was, my sisters and I, two sisters, we inherited the funeral home, and I ended up 
buying out their share around 2000. And we had adopted our children, two children, 
twins, in 1987, and we wanted time to be with them. They were finishing high school 
about that time. Just then, but in 1997, two years after he passed, we put in a 
crematorium. At that time the cremation rate was 13%. And then I saw it gradually 
increase over the years, and more people were opting for things that were different 
from what tradition had in the past. There were a lot of secular people that were not 
attracted to any particular church or anything like that. And I started reading and 
studying more on a funeral officiant—that is, talking with the families, giving them 
information. Rather than just calling in a minister who will read scripture or say a 
prayer that means nothing, trying to deliver some kind of a service that was of value to 
them. And I got called on many times to do that for families, because they had no 
church. Sometimes they did not believe. There always would be somebody in a family 
who was a believer, and I would ask the family, I said, "Now, what Tm going to do is 
talk mainly about the person, share some of the moments y'all have shared with us with 
everybody. But how would you feel if I closed it with a prayer?" "What?" I said, "Well, 
you've got some children over here, some cousins, so forth, who attend church. And a 
prayer may offer them a little bit of comfort." "Well, okay. Just don't make it long." Or 
something like that. So that became more and more evident. 
[0:45:40] And cremation gave way to more and more options. "We'll have the 
funeral when our child gets back from Europe," or "when the family's going to gather 
at our traditional family reunion in August," or something of that nature, "we want to 
have a service then." So rather than, person passes, two days later there's a funeral and 
a committal, now became more, we can do it when it's convenient. People never cease 
to amaze me, the options they would want to do with the cremated remains. One 
person who just had me pick up and cremate kept being anxious, "When can we get the 
ashes back?" I said, "Well, soon as I finish the cremation, but I have to wait and get all 
these papers signed," and so forth. Well, I delivered it to them, they said, "Well, can you 
show us how to do this?" I said, "Okay." They took me out to the back garage, and 
there, the decedent, who was a hunter, had a device you use to refill shotgun shells. He 
was a big hunter. They said, "All his friends going to come over, and we're going to 
blast him through shotguns. So where do you put the pellets?" I picked up the little 
funnel so they could pour everything down in there, and although it wasn't part of my 
doing, I said, "When are they going to have the ceremony? Because I want to see it. I 
want to be here." "Well, we don't need you here." "No, I want to be here." And it must 
have been a 150-gun salute. But all the friends kept firing, and you would see puffs of 
white smoke come out the barrel and everything, and they kept firing away and all that 
stuff. And I'm sitting there thinking, you know, it's so atypical, but it provided value, 
and that's what they wanted, and that's what he had requested. You learn to turn off 
this little thing of being surprised with what anybody will say and do. I remember one 
that said, "Well, we took his ashes home, and we flushed them." "Okay." (Laughs) 
Kind of not my ideal way of a tribute, but okay. Scattering at the beach was always a 
popular thing. I have a lot of times when I have some, and they just say, "Will you just 
scatter them when you go to the beach?" We would always go down and rent a 
pontoon boat for the family, and I would have some ashes, and I would get over near 
the marshes and scatter them there because it provided food and nutrition for the oyster 
shells. So they could come back as mother of pearl. But it's just all—a wonderful, 
personal experience, some of them linked heavily with faith, and some of them linked 
with lifestyles. I enjoyed it thoroughly. 2013 I had to have triple bypass surgery, and I 
realized I had to slow down. Three years later, about three years later, I sold the 
business, retired, and now — still the funeral director in me. I went to a friend's funeral 
this morning, I went to a friend's funeral yesterday It's more than just something to do. 
You develop an emotional attachment with a lot of people. And there are people that 
said, "Whatever happens, wherever you are, I want you to be there, because you've 
been there for three or four generations of our family." 
[00:50:02] And there are a lot of people who meant a lot for me through life, so to 
me, being there for them when their time comes, and their family knows that I'm there, 
that's personally rewarding. It's all about feelings. 
I feel, particularly some, that if I wasn't there, that I'd done wrong. I can recall who — 
well, been more than one, but they don't' call the funeral home, but they call me on my 
cell phone, and ask me what to do. And I refer them to the funeral home, and I say, "But 
I will be there for you." And one even said, "They're going to take care of my brother, 
but I want you to work the service." So I did. I mean, not compensated or anything like 
that, but it's just my little gift to the family. I'm not bragging about myself, but it's just 
something that once, it's ingrained in you so far, that you stick with it. But today, since 
we've lost our son in 2011, and we have had his daughter in our care since she was a 
year old, in 2005, we now have a 12-, soon-to-be-13-year-old, that's making retirement 
everything except what we expected. (Laughs) So. That's life. Okay. That's about all my 
knowledge and then some. (Laughs) 
[00:52:18 Break in recording to change camera batteries] 
Okay. The question was, what are the qualities of a good death-care professional? It 
really varies by what position a person wants. There are those who are good at 
following instructions and doing what you want them to do. And they're very good at 
technical. And then there are those that I say think on their feet. The ones that think on 
their feet are the ones who are creative. There are some that, as I explained the 
differences in changing customs, would shock other people, because, "That's not the 
way we do it!" My father, as good a funeral director as he was, could not function in 
today's world. There are a lot of things that happen in funeral or memorial services that 
change by the moment, and you have to be very attentive to them. And if it's something 
that's, somebody just stands up to say something because they want to share a story, 
you know, grab the wireless mic and say, "Does anybody else want to share 
something?" And it's just one service I had before I retired, the family said, "Just pass 
the microphone around." And we did. And it was one of the best services I've heard in 
a long time, because we had people from a large, broad spectrum giving different views 
of the person's life that were all precious to them. I mean, that's — You know, here you 
have a teacher who, like us, is raising a grandchild, and she's very artistic and creative. 
You've got people from the community that are artistic, that knew her strong points 
there. Her work with the church—people who knew her strong points with the church. 
her strong faith. It's just amazing, the stories that you can do with things like that. But 
you've got to be attentive to that. You've got to have people who can communicate. 
[00:55:02] It's not about taking a prepared form, and saying, "Now, John Doe, what 
was his address? What is his Social Security number? Where was he born? His mother 
and father's names?" That's what I call cookbooking. I always start out, and I believe 
the best way to approach people is, "Sarah, share with me a little bit about your 
grandmother. I want to know what kind of person she was. I want to know what were 
the important things for her in life. I want to know what she liked to do. Let's talk about 
that for a little while." And you'll find out, then, you're bonding, because—I'm 
paraphrasing—"Sarah, you told me your grandmother left Cuba and came to the 
United States. That had to be a big transition in life." Sarah begins to tell me about her 
changes in America. Well, you see. I'm keeping all this in my head. I haven't picked up 
the pencil yet. That's —that's what's important. And it doesn't have to be someone 
who's made a big transition like that. It could be someone who grew up, dropped out of 
school, went to work in a textile mill, and their life was textile mill, go home, go to 
church. 
[VIDEO drops out at 00:57:00 to change camera battery.] "Tell me about their friends, 
what they liked to do?" 
[Break in recording] 
[00:57:12] Okay, we're talking about people from all classes, everybody has an 
interesting story to tell. I always thought it was a coincidence that in 2000, Steve 
Hartman from CBS News and Les Rose, his photojournalist, just happened to drop in 
on me to do a story, and the program they did for CBS News was "Everybody Has a 
Story." And I think that's what a lot of people in funeral service are missing. Everybody 
has a story. And we're the ones that are going to help you tell it. And I'll admit, there 
are people that, they say, "I really don't want to do that." That's fine. There are people 
that are going to say, "We just want to have Mama cremated, and we'll take care of 
everything else." That's fine. But I want to hear about your mama. You know, I don't 
care if there's no other services, let me just hear about her. Because to me, being a 
natural curious folklore historian, I love to hear about people's lives, and I like to hear 
what forces they went through that shaped them to be what they are. And that's where 
I get my writing from, is the impact people made upon me. I think about the woman 
whose service I went to today. She lived in Rock Hill, South Carolina, was originally 
from here, and I think she was Miss Laurinburg in 1951. So that goes back a ways. And 
all I would hear, someone in her family would die, and I'd get a telephone call, "Hi, 
Beacham. This is Norma Joyce." "Hey." And I would hear her voice telling me all about 
her family, about that person and everything. And she was always trying to figure out, 
what can I do to help them, and all of that. Norma Joyce on the phone for several years 
sounded like one of the most caring, angelic people you would ever meet. And then we 
had a service one day in her family, and I was standing out at the graveside where 
everybody was talking, after the committal service, and I heard a voice. 
[00:10:10] I said, "That's a voice I've heard on the telephone." I looked around, and I 
walked up, I said, "You've got to be Norma Joyce." Probably talked to her for three 
years on the telephone and never met her, and there she was. She was always wanting 
to do what was right. Not selfish, what was right. And when I picked up the paper 
yesterday and I saw that she had passed, and a funeral home in Rock Hill was bringing 
her here for a graveside service, I wanted to be there. Because she was that special. But I 
think there are people in funeral service that need to be good business managers. It's, 
they, to me, if I were to be the one in charge of the finances and making sure everything 
is paid, don't put me out meeting the family, if that's my specialized position. I'm going 
to be the bookkeeper. There are people that are good embalmers, but don't have 
personality. Keep them in the preparation room. There are people who can take care of 
the details and the paperwork involved in the cremation. That may be their strong 
point. But the ones that truly make a difference and make a value in the service are 
those who can communicate, the one who can get the information out, not just that she 
loved to vacation at the beach—to get the stories about the beach, to get the funny 
stories, because there are times in life we have serious moments, and there are times we 
have happy moments, and there are times that we have some joyous moments. And I 
always feel that it's good to blend them all, but try to get the ones, particularly those 
stories, that people will laugh out loud, because a funeral—as is said, we all know we're 
not getting out of this world alive—a funeral doesn't have to be sad. It's helping the 
transition. It's helping us remember the true memories. Sitting there, there have been 
services that I've been to where the minister is up there, basically preaching a service of 
salvation, and telling about somebody, and I keep thinking, "They're not talking about 
the same person I know." I always said the funeral is that time where you're 
transitioning, where you're learning to end the relationship you had and cherish the 
memories of that relationship. So it's not a time to make false promises. It's not a time 
to, as one minister I just heard started a graveside service, said, "I didn't know So-and- 
So, so I don't know whether she's gone up or gone down, but I suspect she's gone 
down." I'm sorry— the compassionate person in me wants to choke somebody. But that 
still goes on. And I can think of a lot of struggles, knowing that person that died. She 
had a rough life. Her mother died when she was young. Her father remarried, second 
wife had nothing to do with her. You know, we all fall into traps like that. And I think 
despite the traps she fell in, she persevered, she lived. But knowing what I went 
through with our son, with losing him to drugs, once somebody gets on drugs, they 
don't have control of their life anymore. 
[00:01:05] And I'm not one to condemn them for that. I'm saying we need to 
understand the motive for something like that that happened. Because the opioid 
epidemic in America is very real. And I know, because I've lived it. The son that I talked 
to and tried to reason with, it never got through to his heart because it was blocked by 
the drugs. And I think a lot of the deaths that people die because of drug abuse, or 
something like that, that we need to show compassion and understanding for the 
family. And that is the role of the funeral professional to lead. That is also the role of 
any minister to understand. We all worship differently, and the main thing is, always 
leave a door open for hope. I look at it, I say, "My Jesus was on the cross, and he turned 
to one beside him who was no telling how bad of a person, and he said, 'Today, thou 
shalt be with me in Paradise/" So. The funeral director, the minister, that truly 
understand that analogy is the one that needs to be the one meeting people. Okay? 
Sarah Bryan: Thank you so much, Beacham. 
Beacham: Okay.
