WILLIAM P. KNORR ^ 
Kremmling 
1863 — 1934 
Born in Germany, lie came tu America in 
1882. He engaged in mining and freighting 
in the Breckenridge and Montezuma areas. 
In 1900, he married Corinne Guyselman, and 
purchased a ranch on the Blue River from her 
father. Judge Guyselman. He continued to 
operate and expand this ranch until his death. 
A pioneer in the introduction of Hereford 
cattle into this area, he was always active in 
the Blue Valley Stockgrowers’ Association, 
serving some years as its President. He was 
also a County Commissioner at one time. The 
original ranch, together with other ranches, is 
still in operation and being managed by his 
sons, Ted, George, and Karl. 
103 
the San Juan Basin in 1885, one of the four 
sons was six-year-old Frederick Wilson. An 
early cattleman of the Animas Valley, he was 
always progressive and interested in new live¬ 
stock developments. He founded the Fanners 
Supply of Durango, an organization dedicated 
to “Service to Agriculture” and he was a 
leader in the industry for 45 years. The busi¬ 
ness continues to grow on the same sound 
principle. Frederick Kroeger left his mark, 
straight and clear. The brand he inherited 
from his father, the LU, is now used by the 
fourth generation of this well-known pioneer 
family.

April 7, 1858 — July 30, 1921 
He was horn and educated in Ulster Coun¬ 
ty, New York. In 1881, he went to Buffalo 
County, Nebraska, where he entered the mer¬ 
cantile and hanking business. In 1892, he be¬ 
came associated with Swift & Company of 
Chicago. For yours he managed their land and 
livestock interests in Nebraska, Colorado, New 
Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. In 1897, he located 
in Juckson County, Colorudo, where Swift & 
Company operated extensively under the name 
of The North Park Cattle Company. He con¬ 
tinued with Swift & Compuny until its ranch 
holdings were liquidated. In 1913, he purchased 
his own ranch at Hooper, Colorado. This prop¬ 
erty included the Medano and Zapata ranches. 
It totaled 100,000 acres, including leased land, 
und ran several thousand head of Hereford 
cattle. George was married, in November of 
1892, to Rosu E. Ogilvie, of Gibbon, Nebraska. 
They had five children: Earl O., Howard K., 
Albert L., Margaret L., and Lyman G.
