START
INF Oh, the usual childhood games: hopscotch, basketball, baseball uh kickball, uh we
played dolls and dressing up um we used to like to hunt snakes and uh catch bugs.
FW Explain how hopscotch was played.
INF Well, uh we used up to 8 numbers. And we would either use a peice of glass or a
small pen and we would throw from one block to the other and try not to step in that block.
Well, I was fortunate enough to have a doll house that was built for me out in my back
yard. And the girls, little girls would come over and uh we'd bring our dolls over and we
played. Take the clothes off and give them a bath and feed them. Two or three days later
the food was really smelling.
FW <unintelligible text>
INF Well, some days it was pretty good and a some days it wasn't. Between five and
seven. Well, that was my first time going out to school and that was a big adventure.

No. I did get a chance to go a lot of places at that age more so than I was when I was
older because they had special rates for children and this meant a big savings for my
family.
Not too much. Not to my knowledge. I don't think so.
Well, really I don't know. I really couldn't say.
FW <unintelligible text>
INF Well, the last one that says not It, they were the one that had to tag someone else,
make them It. And this went on and on and on until
0071 p. 2
INF we got tired.
No, we would have to say Not It real quickly and the last one that said it, they were It.
Usually we would either draw straws or the last hand on the bat, if it were baseball or we
would put, you know, make fists and do it in that fashion.
Basketball. Well in my childhood, I was the only child period. So it was a lot of boys in my
neighborhood and this seemed to be the thing and uh the majority of the faimily at the time
when I was growing up, either it was just one child or either it was only one girl so we had

to play with the boys. And I think it was about 4 girls out of the whole bunch, so we played
with the boys.
Rough. Yeah, you know, that's all. You had to rock them and sock them. Oh; I was pretty
rough to be a girl.
Yes uh let me think. Gee whiz, can't uh... Oh uh one we used to play was Down the
Mississippi river boat goes push. We used to play that. Well, that was the rhyme Down the
Mississippi river boat goes push. And the ones behind you would push, you know, they
had to come into the rope just as you said push and whoever was first they would say it
and then the one that was behind had to push when the river boat goes push. And then
they had one that would say, One Two and then the next one would come along and say
3, 4 and you couldn't lose time, you had to keep up. Well, uh we had one we would say uh,
Oh dear, this is so hard to think of. Um, I really can't think of anymore not, you know, not
in rhyme, to think of the whole rhyme. We had one that you would say the names of the
month. And then we had one that you would tell the name of your lover.

Oh, gee whiz. I saw part of it last night because I came in on the late part. Uh, I did see
one. This has been about two weeks ago uh Cinamon was captured and they tried to
break her and make her tell why she was uh stealing some things from the state. And um
her companion tried to get her free and eventually they did. And then, oh yes. I remember
last week's too. It was about this fellow who had made this germ culture from this deadly
bacteria. Yeah. Um and their their mission was to destroy the bacteria and which they did.
Well, um you know they fellow, Greg Morrison had um made all the substitutes through
this uh duck that they had cut in the wall. And uh in this lab, you know, like in a <gap>
you know, work with the arms. Well this fellow would push the arms and of couse they
would pick up the substitutes instead of the real thing and they would push them. And um,
I can't think of the real sharp nosed guy's name, but uh he was the guine pig. And uh they
thought that he was really being affected by the uh bacteria, but he wasn't because it had
been substituted. And it looked like a culture, but it wasn't. And you could tell the culture
was destroyed and the man uh his whole set up was destroyed.
Well, I sit there and watch a lot of things with the children. I'm not particularly interested
in them. And that's That Girl and Bewitched. And on Monday nights I like to look at Big
Valley. That is one of mine.
WDS oo7l p. 4
INF No. I have gone to some of the children's matinees out at Shady Grove; nothing
for myself. My children love those things. Well, they like musicals, like they went to see
the Sound of Music three times. And um they like live plays. I mean because during the
summer when I can take them to the children's shows they like to go. And they're going to
be quite costly when I take them to see Charlie Brown.

No. We can't have pets in the house.
No. I owned a police dog when I was a child. And he died from old age. Oh, ever since
I could remember, you know, from being a little tot. And when he died he was about 12
yeards old. We had to put him to sleep. Well, I didn't go.
Well, no. He was more like my protection because um. I loved him I'm not going to say
I wasn't a little devil, because I used to do quite a few things and uh I could never get a
spanking with him around. Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it at all.
I went to Payne and Lovejoy. I went to Brown and Langley and I went to Cardoza.
I started there at the age of four. And uh let's see. I went up to the fourth grade because
they were too crowded. So I had to do the fifth and sixth grade over at Lovejoy. Oh, I
loved to go to Payne school. That was in my neighborhood and it was around my friends
although makig new friends was always a new adventure, it ?.
Well, that was more a of a general thing.. I think it was a uh, I would say to me it was a uh
a deciding point. The courses that I took helped me to decide what I wanted to do. You
know, for senior high and how I wanted to prepare myself.
