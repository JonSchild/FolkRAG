David RiceThe Wind That Sweeps o'er the Wild Moor.Alternative title: Mary of the Wild Moor.'Twas
a cold stormy night in the winterAnd the wind blew across the wild moorPoor Mary came along
with a baby in her armsAnd she stood on her own father's door."Oh [,?] father, dear father," she
cried,"Come down, please, and open the door,For the babe in my arms will perish and dieBy the
wind that sweeps o'er the wild moor."Oh, why did I leave this dear spotWhere once I was happy and
free?I am now doomed to roam without parent or home,And no one to take pity on me."The old man
being deaf to her cries,Not one  [tone?] sound ? of her voice reached [?] his ear,But the dogs they
did bark and the village bells tolledBy the wind that sweeps o'er the wild moor.Oh, what did the old
man thinkWhen he came to the door in the morn[,?]Poor Mary was dead, but the babe still lieClosely
pressed in the sad mother's arms.The old man in grief pined awayAnd [?] ? [???] [?] And no one, they
say,[?] has lived [there?] until this day ? And the cottage to ruin has gone.
And the child to its mother [?] soon
The [villages?] [villagers?] point at the spotWhere the willows droop over the door , Saying, "There
Mary died , once the gay village bride,By the wind that sweeps o'er the wild moor .
