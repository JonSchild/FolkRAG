Shady Grove
SHADY GROVE
Vernie Allen Shafter, 1940
Shady Grove, my little love Shady Grove, I'm bound Shady Grove, my little love Shady
when the sun goes down.
Wish I had a big black horse Feed him feed him on Little nigger boy to feed him while I'm
gone.
Shady Grove, my little love Shady Grove, I'm bound Shady Grove, my little love Shady
when the sun goes down.
Wish I was a turtle dove Fly from vine to vine You have got my sweetheart And I hope
you're satisfied.
Shady Grove, my little love Shady Grove, I'm bound Shady Grove, my little love Shady
when the sun goes down.
Wish I was a little goldfish Swimmin' on the bank of the sea Dive to the bottom and never
to rise For no one cares for me.
Shady Grove, my little love Shady Grove, I'm bound Shady Grove, my little love Shady
when the sun goes down.
