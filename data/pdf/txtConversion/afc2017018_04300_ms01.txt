I: 
All right. Ready? 
P: 
I’m ready. 
I2: 
I’m going to record there, record there—and the way you touch this, that’s fine, but be careful about 
that. 
I: 
Okay. S. SB. Thank you for joining us today and agreeing to do this interview with us about the work 
that you do  [68.57] as a personal care worker. I know everybody calls personal care workers different things. 
It’s sort of the big generic name that we use is personal care assistant or PCA for short, so I’ll probably be 
using that even though you might call yourself something different. So, how do you refer to call the work that 
you do? 
P: 
Home health aide, I guess because that’s what they—from the agency, that’s what they call us. So, that 
sounds perfect [laughs]. 
I: 
Okay. So, if somebody says, S, what do you do for a living? You say, “I’m a home health aide?” 
P: 
I’m a home health aide. Yup. 
I: 
All right. Well, let’s just start. We want to hear your story. Tell us about how you got into this work. How 
long you’ve been doing it. Why you got into it. What draws you to it? 
P: 
Okay. I’ve been doing this for almost 9 years. It’ll be 9 years in July. I started out looking for something 
that was kind of in the medical field. I had just graduated from a medical-assistant program and was trying to 
look for something with flexible hours because I also had a child and was trying to fit in work and child and 
everything. This came up, and I thought it looked exciting and interesting, and I’ve always loved working with 
the elders, and so I got into it thinking I could just try it out, and now 9 years later, I’m still doing it [laughs]. It 
still gives me the flexibility to maintain my life and taking care of my children, and then also helping others. So 
[67.6].  
I: 
So, 9 years later you’re still doing it. What keeps you in the most? I know the flexible hours. Those are 
golden. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. A lot of it I just really, I like what I do a lot. I like my clients. I really do. I haven’t had a 
particularly [laughs] difficult, difficult client that I’ve had long term. I keep getting clients moving from one to 
another and they make my work easy, basically, and their families. Yeah [laughs]. 
I: 
Can you tell us—for a lot of people they don’t really understand what a personal care worker does—
what a PCA does? Can you describe for people what your job involves? What do you do for your clients? 
P: 
Well, a lot of people don’t know. When I say home health aide they look at me like I’m a housekeeper 
or [laughing] something. I don’t think they really realize. We go into a person’s—wherever they’re living. It could 
be their home or an apartment. It could be an assisted living facility and they just need extra care and help 
them to make their day easier, and that depends on the person what that is. But we’re there just to make their 
life easier whether it’s just sitting with them and talking with them because they don’t have anybody else to talk 
to or going in and cleaning or cooking for them or grocery shopping. We’re also there to—like an extra set of 
eyes because if they have children that are not in the area or they don’t have a lot of visits, just somebody else 
to, you know, keep an eye on them and make sure that their health is staying the same or if it’s getting worse 
or better or whatever that may be. 
I: 
So, do you also provide physical care?

P: 
Yes. I have. The client that I currently have, there is not a lot of physical care. She is healthy and sassy 
and likes to kind of [64.39] do her own thing, and I just help her along the way. I’ve had clients that are 
basically bedridden. At that point, there’s a, you know, there’s the time to consider them going into a facility, 
and then my job is done with them, but when they’re recovering from a surgery or something that has taken a 
toll on them, yeah, there’s the extreme care where they can’t get outta bed, and so you do everything for them. 
You bathe them, you feed them, you, you know, try and move them around as much as possible. 
I: 
And how many clients do you have at any given time? 
P: 
I like to have one [laughs]. I do—in the beginning I did a lot more than that because I was still kind of 
feeling out—I mean it’s the first time that I’d done a job like this before [63.39]. You know, I was trying to get 
my hands into it as much as possible and learn it, and so I had, you know, probably three or four at that point. 
But right now, I have one that I focus on, and I like that. I like just having one, so. 
I: 
And what is it about that that you really like? 
P: 
[Sigh] I don’t know. I don’t feel as spread thin if I have just one, and I can focus. You know, I can’t get 
confused with the different clients or anything. I can give her my full attention, and you know, if she needs extra 
hours, I can give her extra hours.  
I: 
And about how many hours a week do you work? 
P: 
[Sigh] I work about between 10 and 15 hours a week. 
I: 
Okay. And how long have you had this one client? 
P: 
I’ve had her—I actually had her when I first started 9 years ago, and then it was actually her husband 
that we were caring for, and then he passed away and now it’s just her. And so, I actually trained with her 
when I first started, and had her, and then went on to other clients, and came back to her again probably 4 
years ago. So, it’s been about 4 years. 
I: 
For quite a while. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
So, you when help somebody over that span of time, you develop a relationship. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Can you talk about that a little bit? 
P: 
Yeah. It’s difficult, you know, because she is—we are close. I mean I’m in her home all the time, and 
with personal care I mean you can’t—you have to form some kind of bond and trust there, and I do—she is 
part of my life even thought it’s work she’s part of my life that [61.30] I appreciate, and it’s sometimes hard to 
define that line because you have this special person. But you can’t talk about [laughing] this special, you 
know, you can’t talk about it with, you know, family or anything, you know, because—well, they don’t let you, 
so. But she is—she makes me laugh, and she really does make it easy to go into work every day. I mean it’s 
not like work. It’s like a member of the family almost. 
I: 
It’s interesting to describe it that way. I’ve heard personal care workers talk about sometimes the 
difficulty in establishing boundaries, and you work for an agency, correct? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Yeah. So, they have policies, procedures? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18

P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You must get like a plan of care. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
With a list of what you’re supposed to be doing for your client, right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
But it sounds like you do a lot more besides just what’s on that list. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
There’s more to it than just the black and white task list. 
P: 
Right. Yeah. And there’s a lot of the—the client that I have—it’s not just me seeing her. She also has 
other [60.15] aides in as well, and they all, you know, all of us are very close to her, and she makes it easy to, 
you know, she’s very likable. And she was just—I was with her today, and she was just talking about one of the 
other aides she had. She has these like sweatshirts or jacket things that she puts on, but she doesn’t have 
enough pockets in them for everything, so one of the aides took home her sweatshirts and sewed pockets on 
them [laughs] and brought ‘em back, you know. And she was telling me, you know, she’s so thankful that she 
did that, you know, and she just wants to repay her, but you know, she can’t. And there’s no way for her to 
figure out how to do that other than saying thank you. Even though she wants to—the client wants to do more 
because of the, you know, the policies and everything. So, sure. 
I: 
Boundaries. 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. 
I: 
So, what is the most challenging thing about your job? 
P: 
[Sigh] the most challenging thing is—well, I guess the most obvious thing would be if you have a client 
that doesn’t want you to be there. That’s not the case for me at this moment, but I have had clients who don’t 
want you there, and that’s, you know, that makes you not want to be [laughing] there. Naturally, not want to be 
there either, and you know, that makes your work hard. I’ve had clients that are not necessarily elderly, but we 
take on because they’re recovering from a serious injury or like a hospitalization that [58.15]—they’re a little bit 
older, but not into 80s and 90s that we usually do. Like 60s or 70s, and that’s also difficult because they don’t 
think that they need help either, and they’re younger, and you know, they’re not used to having somebody walk 
around them all the time. 
I: 
Can you think of a—does a story stand out in your mind? 
P: 
I had one younger client who her husband wanted her to have 24-hour care. She had been injured, and 
was walking with a walker, and just trying to build up strength to get back her—she was very active previously, 
and just trying to get back to that. And her husband was a little bit older and didn’t trust himself to do it. So, 
they took on 24-hour care, and she didn’t want us [laughing] there, and he wanted us there. So, there was a 
fight between them, and you know, slowly after a few days she got used to us there, and she was okay with 
that. And it ended up to be more of, you know, you have to learn how to work with those kinds of people. You 
know, she didn’t want us standing over her all the time, so we didn’t. We just kind of sit back and let them have 
their own space. You don’t need to be sitting right next to her [56.44] all the time or holding her hand, you 
know. When she did need care, you just kind of followed her to—if it was to the bathroom and she did 
everything—showered and everything on her own, but it just became a matter of changing, you know, her care. 
It’s not like you’re gonna do care on some 90-year-old person that can’t walk. That was a little more difficult to 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18
3
understand, but in the end, she appreciated it, and she was—by the time care was done she was not as angry 
about having people in her home [56.03]. 
I: 
So, every client’s different—some are young, some are old, some want you there, some don’t. And so, 
you never really know what you’re going to get when you walk through that door, right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And you have to kind of size it up and figure out how to deal with that particular person. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. I do. I had another client that was one of the other difficult ones, and she was 
definitely that way because I walked in and she did not want me there. And I heard that she’s not—she’s 
resisting care. I didn’t realize to the extent, so I walked in like I was the happiest person. I was gonna make this 
lady love me, and it was gonna be completely different, and it wasn’t [laughs]. You know, she—it ended up she 
had her moments where she was happy that I was there - if the attention was directed off of her or if the 
attention was directed off of me—if we were watching TV, or she had a dog that she liked to play with, so if her 
attention was focused on something other than us, she was okay. But, yeah, that was definitely trying to figure 
out what was going to try to make her happy and what was gonna trigger her [54.41]. Yeah. 
I: 
So, how do you—when you go in and you face unexpected things, let’s say—you get certain 
information from the agency about the client, right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
About what kind of needs they have, but you walk in and you find that they actually need more care 
than you thought or there are a lot of other people living there that you didn’t know about— 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Has that kinda a thing happened? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. I had one client that I just saw one time, and her—she lived with her son, and her 
son was very hard to get along with and was not appreciative of his mother being there at all. So, anyone that 
came in, he didn’t really appreciate them coming in either, so it’s hard [pause]—it’s hard when you have a 
family member in the house at the same time, and that particular client it was very hard because he made it 
hard for me to work because everything I did was wrong to him—and they (the agency) didn’t tell me that 
[laughing]. They said, “The son is living there,” and then that was the end of the story. So, when I got there and 
after you know, even a couple of minutes of conversation with him I realized that this was going to be a lot 
more difficult than what I thought [53.04]. So, yeah, I had to just tune him out at that point. There was no other 
way to do it. If I had to give his mother the care that she needed to have, he couldn’t be part of it. So, I just kind 
of blocked him out, and did what I had to do. 
I: 
That’s how you dealt with it? 
P: 
That’s how I dealt with it. 
I: 
You said you only went there one time. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Why is that? 
P: 
I don’t know. I think I was just filling in, and I don’t think that it was—I don’t think it was a permanent—I 
don’t think we had that client for very long. I think that when I went, it was just to fill in for somebody else.

I: 
Has there ever been a client that you couldn’t deal with or that when you got there, you felt like they 
needed more care than you were capable of giving or you were kind of out of your skill level? 
P: 
No. There really hasn’t. I know going through training—because of training we went through all those 
skill levels. I mean from, you know, the most care to the least care, and some of the ones that needed the most 
care I thought, you know, at that point it was above what I could possibly do even though they were [laughing] 
training me to do it. Physically, I don’t think I could have. Picking up a person that weighs twice as much as 
me. I just—I couldn’t. There’s no way that I could have done it, but, you know, through the years walking in to a 
client I usually know [51.21], and they usually ask if the person has some like catheter care or something like 
that. They will make sure the aide knows how to do that and makes sure you’re prepared. They won’t let you 
go in and be completely blindsided, so. 
I: 
Can you say something more about the training that you received? 
P: 
The training was—it’s all written down and broken into I believe five days, I want to say, as far as going 
out into the field and working - I think it was two different aides that I did the training with, and it was basically 
just following them along, and for long days [laughing]. 
I: 
Do you feel it adequately prepared you? 
P: 
For some of it, it did. A lot of the more intensive things—a lot of the more, you know, the medical 
aspects of it, it didn’t. I mean it’s something that you would have to do over and over again. Like again, the 
catheter care. I don’t deal with catheters very often, so for me to walk into a house right now and somebody 
needs that, I don’t—I couldn’t do it. And we do now—my agency has switched, so the agency that I actually 
hired on with merged with another agency, so now it’s a different one. So, now this new larger agency has 
annual training where there’s an actual skills lab that we can go to, and we have to go through all this with 
oxygen tanks, catheter care, Hoyer lifts, what else was on there? Just general transfers to refresh us every 
year, so that’s a good thing [49.02]. 
I: 
And what would you find—what do you think are some of the most important things you bring to the job 
and to the client? What’s the value of what you bring to the client? 
P: 
I guess just a sense that they can live on their own, and you know, helping them to be able to do that 
and not have to go into a nursing home because I mean if you think about myself put in their position, you 
know, I don’t want to. If I could stay in my home for as long as I could I would, and we want to help them be 
able to do that. The client that I have now was recently in the hospital and went into a rehab facility, and she 
just wanted to go home. That was her only thing—I just want to go home, and so she—I don’t know how—she 
bounced back so [laughing] quickly, but she did. And now it’s my job and the other aide’s job to help her stay 
there, and she’s thriving. So, she’s doing great there, so. 
I: 
Can you think of one story that you feel is sort of the success story? You know, you had a client that 
you could help, and you went home feeling really good about what you’ve contributed to this person being in 
her own home? 
P: 
I had a very long-term client that was in her home probably longer than she should have been, and 
there were only two aides. It was me and another aide that she would have, and she was again another—we 
were very close, and I would think that would be a success because she—I don’t know—she just stayed in her 
home for longer than she [laughing]—maybe that’s not a success because she stayed longer than she should 
have, but— 
I: 
But she was able to do that because—

P: 
She was able to do it, yeah. Her kids were not even in the state. They were on the other side of the 
country. This—we were the only people that she had so she appreciated us as much as we appreciated her 
[46.12]. 
I: 
[Inaudible]. 
P: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
You did great. 
P: 
Thanks. 
I: 
Are you feeling a little more relaxed? 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Good. 
P: 
[Laughs]. 
I2: 
Doesn’t this feel like a relief right now? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
Okay. Good. 
I: 
Yeah. So, just keep ignoring him. We’re old friends chatting. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Haven’t seen you in years and years and years— 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
You’re filling me in on—I’m so interested in your work. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
[Laughing]. And you have kids? Two kids, three? 
P: 
I do. I have two. 
I: 
How old are there? 
P: 
Seven and 11. 
I: 
Boys? Girls? 
P: 
Two girls.  
I: 
What are their names? 
P: 
A and M. 
I: 
Nice. 
P: 
They’re fun [45.11]. 
I2: 
Just changing batteries. So, I’ve been going through a bunch of [inaudible], and it’s because I didn’t 
have this cord, so now I do, but that still needs to get charged up.

I: 
Okay. Are you happy with your new [inaudible]? 
I2: 
So wonderful. It makes such a big difference in quality. May I ask you to light the left side of your hair 
because there’s one loop coming up, go ahead. Awesome. Perfect. Do that one more time. There’s some 
strays on this side. 
P: 
They’re going crazy. 
I2: 
Your hair looks awesome. 
I: 
Yeah. No, your hair is—this is going crazy [group laughter]. This we keep restrained [group laughter] 
and let it out at night. 
P: 
It’s not even humid yet. Wait ‘til it gets humid [laughing]. 
I: 
No. That’s the first thing I do when I get home is I let it out—I let it go free. 
P: 
[Laughs]. My little niece has super, super curly hair. She’s 5 years old, and she’s super sassy, so we 
say the curlier the hair, the sassier she is ‘cause then in the summer they get really tight curls, and it’s so cute 
[43.58]. 
I: 
My hair is full of products right now. 
I2: 
Do this swipe one more time. 
P: 
Do the swipe. 
I2: 
Perfect. Perfect. And is that where you’re gonna sit? Like that way? 
P: 
I can. 
I2: 
You can move around a little, but I’m gonna focus on where you are now. 
I: 
Yeah, the shirt looks great with the lemon. 
I2: 
Yeah. I noticed that. 
I: 
[Laughing] 
P: 
Oh, yeah. I did that on purpose. 
I2: 
I am—should I get started? 
I 
Yes, please. 
I2: 
Cool. Actually, let’s just be quiet for a little bit. I’m going to record some [inaudible] noise. Okay, and 
now we’re going to start recording video as well. Do one more swipe. Your hair looks awesome. I’m just trying 
to get rid of some— 
P: 
Or should I just put it back? 
I2: 
Yeah. If you could do that, make sure it’s in the center in back and not on your shoulders. 
P: 
Is that gonna work? 
I2: 
Yeah. Your hair looks great. Yeah. Relax [inaudible]. You look awesome. Don’t worry about that. 
P:

I2: 
I just wouldn’t interrupt the recording for it, so yeah, both of you sound good, and I’m ready. 
I: 
Okay, S, we’re gonna switch gears just a little bit. I’m gonna throw out some scenarios for you. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
You talked a little bit earlier about never really knowing what you’re going to find when you walk into a 
house, and you’re there by yourself most of the time, right? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, it’s not like you can yell for help or ask somebody else for advice or, you know, how do you think we 
should handle this? You’re kind of on your own figuring it out, so let me throw out just a few scenarios that you 
may or may not have encountered. And let us know if you’ve encountered then, and if you have, how that 
made you feel, and how you dealt with it, okay? 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, have you ever felt unsafe? 
P: 
[Pause] no. I really—no. I really haven’t. 
I: 
That’s good. 
P: 
Yeah [laughs]. 
I: 
That’s real good. Have you ever encountered a client or a family member, for that matter, who was 
inappropriate? Sexually inappropriate or used offensive language or anything like that? 
P: 
Mm mmm. No. I’m trying to think of—no [laughing]. 
I: 
You’re fortunate [group laughter]. Have you ever had clients who had belief systems or cultural 
traditions quite different from your own? 
P: 
No [laughs]. 
I: 
This is going to be a short interview. 
P: 
[Laughing] I know. Nope. 
I: 
Have you ever been injured on the job? 
P: 
Mmp mmm. 
I: 
No. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Have you ever been worried about that or worried about injuring a client? 
P: 
I think you always worry about [40.08] injuring a client. If you’re, you know, if you’re transferring them—
this is the biggest thing that comes to my mind. I had a client that was in a wheel chair, and every day we got 
him ready and into his wheelchair and to the kitchen table, then from the kitchen table and transfer him to the 
toilet, or just transfer into showers, there’s always that fear when you first get them off that. What if you do slip? 
I had another client that was the same, and he was very large, and had a Hoyer for this purpose, but you could 
not bring that into the bathroom, so it was just you and him in the bathroom. At that point, yeah, it’s a little 
nerve wracking, but because I’ve done it enough times, you know, I am constantly communicating with the 
client about how he’s feeling. If he is weak at that point, you don’t push it, but you have to communicate with 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18
8
them. You can’t just—especially with him, I couldn’t just say it’s okay, and just pick him up and put him in there 
because he had to help me do it. So, at that point, yeah, it’s a little nerve wracking [38.37]. 
I: 
Has there even been a time when you needed to call for help or there was something going on with the 
client that needed immediate attention? 
P: 
No [laughs]. 
I: 
How about this one? 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
I’m guessing that you engage in really intimate care with your clients? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And I’m sure some of them are at least at first uncomfortable with that or, you know, protective of their 
privacy or don’t feel comfortable with you giving them a bath— 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
--helping them, you know, change their underwear or whatever. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, how do you make them feel more comfortable? 
P: 
[Sighs] I had one—after you just said that I just realized I had one client that was a male, and he was 
okay with other aides—other female aides—giving him a shower, but he was not okay with me giving him a 
shower, and I’m not sure why he singled me out [laughs], but he didn’t want me in the bathroom with him. And 
he actually locked himself into the bathroom at one point when I was there and he was very agitated. His wife 
was there too, and was trying to calm him down, and tell him, you know, it’s okay, and it just—it got nowhere. 
Luckily, he made it out safe, and [laughs] no injuries. But, you know, as far as—you have to have some sense 
of modesty, and you have to, again, think about if you were in their shoes, and you know, if you were 
undressed in front of somebody, you know, or trying to get them dressed, what you would do to try and cover 
yourself. And it’s just a matter of, you know, covering them as you can or talking about, you know, family or the 
weather, something other than what’s going on to try and, you know, put them at ease [36.18]. 
I: 
Yes. I’m guessing there are a number of times when the client might feel embarrassed? 
P: 
A lot of—when I find that a client becomes embarrassed is if we weren’t caring for them in that capacity 
before, and then we start to at some point. So, if we go into a house and we’re caring just, you know, meals 
and housekeeping and companionship, and then their house starts declining, and it turns into more toileting 
and showering, at that point the dynamic has changed. And you know, you’ve got to tell them that it’s okay. 
And my client right now that I have, I am—recently I’ve been asking her because we don’t help her shower. 
She does it on her own, you know, if you need help showering, that’s what we’re there for, and we have to 
keep reminding her because we’ve never—she’s never had us do that before. So. 
I: 
So that raises another issue. How do you deal emotionally/personally with the fact that your clients do 
decline? They need more and more help, or they start, you know, might be developing dementia, and clients 
that die? You know, so you see them progress through these—anyway, how does that affect you? 
P: 
You know, it’s hard, and it’s unfair to say, but some clients affect me more than other clients just based 
on how much time I’ve spent with them, but—and the family too has a lot to do with it. Some clients that I’ve 
had I’m not—I don’t see the family, and I don’t know who they are, and I’m not close with them, and other

clients it’s the opposite. You see the family all the time, but it’s just—you have to understand that it is—it’s 
going to happen, and that’s part of the job. I mean you are—this is the last part of their life, and you’re just a 
part of the last part of their life [33.54]. It’s hard, and it’s sad, and you know, you mourn that loss, but then you 
have to keep going onto the next person.  
I: 
And how about clients with dementia? 
P: 
I’m trying to think if I’ve had an ongoing client with dementia, and I don’t [pause]—I don’t know that I 
really have. Some of the clients that I’ve had are starting to enter into that a little bit. It’s harder for me to 
watch—it’s easy for me to handle, and just to be patient with them and everything. It’s harder for me to watch 
the interaction between their family ‘cause a lotta times their family doesn’t understand, and they get very 
frustrated that, you know, mom isn’t remembering things or, you know, it’s like I want to tell their [laughing] 
family that their family should have some dementia training, you know, because the person with dementia 
doesn’t know and doesn’t, you know, there’s nothing you can do but make them comfortable. And we have so 
much dementia training through our agency. We just had another meeting last week about it that I’m not 
uncomfortable with it, but I am when the family comes in to see some of the interactions that go on. 
I: 
So, that raises another aspect of your job and that is you’re not really there just for the client. It seems 
like you offer—you have to interact with family, obviously, and you offer them support, and maybe respite. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, it’s not just about the one person. 
P: 
Right. Yeah. And a lotta times it isn’t—I had a client that it was him and his wife, and his wife actually 
I’m still very good friends with, but she needed—she was his full-time caregiver, and she needed that respite. 
She needed 2 hours a day to go and do whatever she needed to do, and we got along very well, and you 
know, when her husband was declining she, you know, she was there bouncing ideas off of me, and I was 
trying to help her. Not just me, but other, you know, the nurses in the agency and everything [31.05] to have 
that support group for her, you know. When he went into a facility, it was just as important, you know, as 
getting him there because toward the end he wasn’t—he didn’t really understand. So, yeah, sometimes it’s 
more important to be there for the support system, you know, to let them know that it’s okay to do this, you 
know, if the client’s at that point where they don’t know the difference. 
I: 
So, can you tell us a little bit about the labor conditions—the wages, the hours? 
P: 
Well, the hours are—they’re all over. I mean [laughing] the hours are 24-7. I mean, really, we, you 
know, I don’t work—we have certain shifts divided, and certain people like working overnights, but I don’t. 
But— 
I: 
But you do, do it? 
P: 
I don’t, no. We do have one weekend a month where we’re on-call, and even that you can sign up for 
what shift you want to be on-call. So, you’re not on-call for 24 hours a day, and the agency is really good with 
knowing that I do not want to work overnights. And we have enough people where that hasn’t been an issue, 
yet. There’s people that like to work overnight because you get paid a little bit more to do it, so you know, to 
find that coverage is not that difficult. The pay isn’t wonderful, I would have to say [laughs]. You know, it’s not a 
draw to people I don’t think. 
I: 
Do you mind sharing how much you get? 
P: 
I get paid $11.72, which is, right now, it’s about 50 cents more than what they’re hiring aides in at right 
now. So, you know, 9 years later it’s not [laughs], you know, it’s not anything exciting by any means.  
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18

I: 
And how does a person make ends meet on that kind of salary? 
P: 
Yeah, well, you know, they don’t. You know, I have a husband that works, and he’s the one that brings 
in the income, and we’re fortunate enough to take the money that I make and just store it away, basically, and 
not have to use what I make. But I know there’s aides that they are the bread winner of the family, and so they 
need these hours, and they need the money, and I don’t know how they do it [27.50]. And recently too after I 
found out about the hiring in [laughing]—about how little I’m getting paid more than people that are, you know, 
getting hired in, I’ve started looking at, you know, other ways that I can just make more money because even if 
I pick up extra hours, it’s still not, you know, I could make more money quicker doing something else. So, 
recently, again, that’s become, you know, an issue that I’ve been doing this for 9 years, and I like it, and I like 
my client, and I’m not about to quit my job, but if I add on another job to kind of help with funding that would 
be— 
I: 
So, if you added on another job would you do the same kind of work or something different? 
P: 
No. Probably something different because I don’t know. I don’t actually know how much the other aides 
at the other agencies get paid, and I was told that our agency is one of the higher paying agencies in the area. 
So, I don’t think I would do—and it would seem unfair to do that same kind of thing when I have, you know, 
when I’m already doing it. 
I: 
So, just logistically, you said the hours are kind of all over the place. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, how do you schedule a life around hours? Are they consistent hours? 
P: 
They are. Right now, for me they’re consistent. I work, you know, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and 
every other weekend, and I can count on that. 
I: 
And they’re not split hours like a couple hours in the morning, and then a couple hours in the— 
P: 
No. Nope. Nope, they’re not, so you know, it allows me to be able to pick up more shifts if I wanted to 
pick up more shifts, too, which I don’t mind especially with the client that I have. If I leave I know the aides for 
her will cover me, and then if they go on vacation or something, then I can cover them. And that’s the only way 
I can really manage my [laughing] life. I have some set schedule, and actually, the client that I have is very 
flexible with her hours that if I have something that I can’t reschedule, you know, I ask her if I can come in a 
little later and leave a little later or earlier, and other aides do that with her too, and she’s okay with that [25.05]. 
I: 
So, you’ve mentioned other aides a number of times. The client you have now, it sounds like round the 
clock. 
P: 
She doesn’t. She has just twice a day in the morning and at night. 
I: 
Okay. Have you developed—do you have friendships with the other aides? 
P: 
No [laughs]. We don’t see each other. I mean—there’s never an overlapping shift with this particular 
client because it’s 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours at night, usually. 
I: 
Well, maybe other friends that aren’t with the agency, but that do similar work as yours? 
P: 
Not really. No. You know, I’ve one friend that I’ve made from this agency only because she lives right 
next door to—not right next door to me, but in the same area as I do, and then that’s how we kind of connected 
was through that. But otherwise, you know, I see familiar faces at meetings and everything, but outside of work 
we all have very different lives. I mean it’s a very eclectic [laughing] group of people.

I: 
It sounds like it. We’re gonna take a little break. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
Mmm. It’s great. 
I: 
How are we doing? 
I2: 
Good. 
I: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
Very good. 
I: 
Things you’re dying to ask? 
I2: 
No. I just wanna challenge you a little bit, do you mind? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
Are you ready for this? 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
And we can do this back on camera in a second, but like I just wanted you to think a little bit about this. 
There are a lot of things that in your work that you intuit, and those things are not natural for a lot of people that 
are not in your field, and I think that as you’re talking to us, of course, but like you’re also talking to this other 
audience, think about some of those anecdotes or some of those observations or some of those work 
experiences that a lay person wouldn’t know about. This could be something as simple as what if our PCA was 
talking about how she entered a home where her client would use the N word [22.32]? And she had like a 
personal problem with how to care for this person, but then also had that conversation, and that balance of 
culture and care, and all that stuff. So, that’s something that you may probably just be like—yeah, you were like 
an older person, I get it, but to a lot of people that is like something they can relate to. That’s one example, but 
there’s so many other examples. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
And you told us that you work and do another job and that’s great, but like we interviewed PCA who 
was caring for a woman who—and when she was scared she would grab really tight and would cause like 
bruises on her arms—the PCA’s arms. So, you know, like for you that’s like oh, yeah, of course.  
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
So, I challenge you to think about some of those things a little bit. By the way, I’m not probing for bad 
things.  
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
I’m just probing for parts of this job that you expect but aren’t as expected for everyone else. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
Sorry. 
I: 
Does that make sense? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18
12
I: 
So, we could give you like a minute just to sort of think about that, but do stories come to mind [21.12]? 
It sounds like you have had extraordinarily good clients [laughs]. 
P: 
I really have. No. I really have. 
I2: 
Yeah. That’s great. That’s part of the story. 
P: 
Ooh, man. I don’t know.  
I: 
You know, you said in the—that you completed this survey, and you wrote a little essay in there, which 
was quite moving. You said some really nice things in there about why you do this work and how important you 
think it is. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
We’re gonna—this next, last section, we’re going to get into the politics and the social value placed on 
it, and you know, it’s a good opportunity to talk about how meaningful you think this work is not just to you but 
to society. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
You know, what contribution you’re making. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
We have it all—I’d probably say this on tape, but we have—well, I am saying this on tape—it’s 
estimated that we’re going to need 32,000 more workers—direct care workers—by 2020. That’s a year and a 
half away [20.02]. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Yeah. Where are we going to get 32,000 more PCAs? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Well, there’s a reason people aren’t getting into this field, and how can we change that? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And how can we make them a wanna-be personal care worker, and be able to make a living wage at it? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, to K’s, point, it seems like a lot of this just comes naturally to you, you know. You’re naturally a 
patient person, or you automatically say, oh, yeah, of course, we’re just gonna try to put ourselves in their 
shoes [19.18], but somebody else on the outside is probably going, “There’s no way I’d do that job. Why would 
I ever do that job? I couldn’t do that job.” 
P: 
[Laughing] okay.  
I: 
So, you almost have to kind of spell it out for them. 
I2: 
I’m very close. Are we ready? 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
Breathe. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18
13
P: 
[Deep breathe] okay. 
I2: 
[Laughing] okay. 
I: 
There were a couple other aspects of your job—the job conditions that I just wanted to ask about. Do 
you need to worry about liability at all? Are you concerned about liability or is that something your agency 
handles for you? 
P: 
[Sighs] that’s something the agency basically handles—liability. Yeah, yeah. Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, I’d like to shift gears again, and talk a little bit more from a social standpoint—a society 
standpoint—about the work that you do, and as a society we don’t place really high value on personal care 
workers or the work that they do, and I wonder if you’ve felt that or you think that? If you’ve ever had anybody 
say anything like, “You know, you’re just a personal care worker,” or you’ve heard it referred to as “just” a direct 
care worker? 
P: 
Uh-huh. 
I: 
What’s your reaction to that? 
P: 
You know, I understand where people are coming from— 
I2: 
I’m so sorry. I’m sorry. Can you please ask that question one more time? Sorry about that. 
I: 
That’s okay. You’ve given me an opportunity to ask it better. 
P: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
Okay. S, we’re gonna switch gears. We’re gonna talk about this from the societal standpoint. Personal 
care workers in general are not valued very highly by our society, and I think part of it is because maybe we 
don’t value older adults very much—as much as we should in our society, and we don’t—part of it is we don’t 
understand what personal care workers actually do. You’re working in the home, privately, and you know, I’ve 
heard people say, “Well, how hard can it be to cook a meal or to clean a bathroom or to go grocery shopping 
for somebody or just sit there and be a companion?”  
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And, you know, I think don’t understand everything you do in terms of helping somebody with 
loneliness, mental health, but also dealing with physical needs, like going to the bathroom, and taking a 
shower, doing the kinds of things they need to be able to do to stay in their own homes independently. So, I 
don’t have an explanation as to why in general we don’t value the work, but have you felt that at all? Have you 
heard that, and what’s your reaction to it? 
P: 
I can see how people would think that because it’s not—it really isn’t difficult work. I mean it’s not 
[15.31] necessarily physically or mentally demanding in comparison to other jobs, but you know, I think about 
having somebody in the home. I think about, you know, my parents. If I—if they come to a point where they 
need in-home care, I think I can picture which aides I would want there and which ones I wouldn’t. And that in 
itself is important to me because you want somebody—somebody has to be in there that you trust, and you 
know, who you get along with, you know. It is a big deal. For a lot of the clients, too, they do deal with 
depression, and that’s dementia and depression, and to have somebody there makes a huge difference on 
their health. And it’s important just in that aspect I think. 
I: 
So, you started off that answer by saying, it’s not that hard. It’s not physically or mentally demanding, 
and I just know there are so many people that would disagree with you. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18
14
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
I mean a lot of people might say, yeah, “You know, how hard can it be? You know, you don’t need to go 
get a master’s degree for this,” but then there are people who will say, “Wow. There is no way I would do that 
work. I could never, ever do that work. You know, I wouldn’t want to be helping somebody to the bathroom or 
cleaning up after them or…”  So how do you respond? So, I think what I’m trying to say is that what may come 
easy to you, and you kind of just, you know, take it for granted that you have some skills that other people don’t 
have. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
You’re doing some work that other people wouldn’t wanna do. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. Yeah. And that’s true, and I guess—and especially this day and age with the people that 
are aging and need the care, and their children presumably who are supposed to be taking care of them, they 
don’t, I guess, know how to. I mean you’ve had Mom be this persona for your whole life, and now to have to 
take care of her, some people don’t grasp [12.47] how to do that. And that’s understandable, and that’s fine, 
and—or Dad. If I had to take care of my dad as a, you know, personal care giver, I don’t know that I would 
want to do that either, and that’s why it’s, you know, important to have somebody else come in who knows kind 
of what they’re doing, and it allows the family to, you know, have their own life, and there’s, you know, not so 
much pressure on them to have to take care of their parents or. 
I: 
If you could change anything about your job, what would you change? Or is there anything that you 
would change? 
P: 
I’ve always said higher wages. I think we do evals once a year through the agency, and I think every 
single year I think they ask the same question, and I put [laughing] the same thing because that’s really the 
only—really the only thing that I would change. 
I: 
So, you feel the work is worth more than what you’re getting? 
P: 
I do. Yeah. I do. 
I: 
Are there other things—are there ways in which we can help change the way in which we value the 
workers and the work that you do? Pretend for a minute that I’m the president of the United States or the 
Governor, what would you say to me about—how would you describe personal care work and the value that it 
brings to society? 
P: 
Oh, [pause] um I think it’s important—I think the only way to understand it is to put yourself in their 
shoes and understand that people are living longer and longer these days, and they need care. You can’t just, 
you know, push ‘em off to the side or push ‘em in nursing homes. I mean that’s not—for a lot of people that’s 
not even an option. I mean it’s also expensive, and I understand that too, with, you know, people not turning to 
personal care aides, and that might be part of the problem too. But [9.59]— 
I: 
Part of the problem is what? What is it you’re—I didn’t quite understand what you were saying. 
P: 
Where was I going with that? I don’t even know. 
I: 
The cost of care. 
P: 
Oh, the cost of care—it’s expensive to hire personal care aides, and maybe that’s why people don’t do 
it, or they don’t find the need to, you know, put any thought into or funding or anything into this because it is 
expensive. 
I: 
Now, pretend that you’re the President for a minute. You’re the Governor— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18
15
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
--of Michigan, what would you do to get 32,000 more home care workers— 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
--in the next year? 
P: 
Oh, man. I don’t know. I don’t know how you—I don’t know how you change people’s persona or 
people’s minds on this field. I don’t know [laughs]. 
I: 
Do you have advice? Do you have advice for other people who might be thinking about joining this 
field? 
P: 
[Pause] I don’t know. I mean my advice I guess would be to try it, and it’s not gonna hurt to try it. Some 
people don’t like it [8.16], and that’s fine. You don’t want somebody [laughing] here that doesn’t like what 
they’re doing, but to give it a shot because it does—it’s one of the most rewarding careers probably. 
I: 
So, we’re about out of time, and you’ve been terrific, and I want to thank you for this interview and for 
the work that you do because it is so important. Do you have any final thoughts/stories you want to share? Any 
final—is there anything we could be doing different? 
P: 
[Laughs] 
I: 
Or did we miss a question? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Was there something that--? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
No? 
P: 
I don’t think so. 
I2: 
Let me ask you a question. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
You said some great points. You talk a lot about you and your colleagues ever, you know, [inaudible] 
we’ll ask about higher pay. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I2: 
And you also raised another great point that geriatric care is very expensive. Taking both those ideas 
together, do you think that there should be a shift [7.06] in funding towards PCA work? And if so, how could 
that be justified on a public forum? I can ask that in different words if you want? 
I: 
Do you want me to repeat it? 
I2: 
Maybe, if you could just respond to that point as your general comments or maybe not. 
P: 
[Pause] I don’t know [laughing]. I don’t have an answer to that [laughing]. 
I: 
Let me just restate it. See if this helps at all. So, right now most of the long-term care funding goes 
towards nursing homes and Medicaid funding goes towards nursing homes. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18
16
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And so, there is a general cry from advocates to shift a lot of it—shift that money to home care. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
The other thing that happens is we understand there’s a shortage. We talk about the need to train elder 
care workers in geriatric care. Most of the conversation centers around the need for more geriatricians—more 
doctors. 
I: 
Mmm hmmm 
P: 
Most of the conversation centers around the need for more geriatricians, more doctors, more nurses for 
the geriatric training, more social workeres, more [inaudible [ 5.38]. Rarely, rarely do they say, “Yeah. We need 
to pay attention to those direct care workers. We need to make sure we have enough of them, and that they 
get the training they need. It’s kind of, in my view, shocking, but I think to get to K’s question, right now the way 
our financing system is set up is we’re geared towards institutional care. And the way our society’s set up, we 
have this bias towards licensed professional that I think hinders this ability to support direct care workers. So, 
what would you say about that in terms of where should the resources be going, and attention—you know, 
direct care workers are expensive, but doctors and nurses and social workers in nursing homes are a lot more 
expensive? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
Right? 
P: 
Right. Right. 
I: 
So, I don’t know, just some thoughts on that, maybe. 
P: 
[Pause] I don’t know. I have—when you talk about nursing homes and assisted living facilities, I have 
such a negative picture in my mind because it’s how many beds to how many people working there, and it’s 
not good care. I mean you just point blank you can’t—unless it’s a one-on-one situation like in home health, 
where you can give them all of your attention and all of your care to one person, you know, that’s—it’s just a 
better quality of life. You know, the nursing homes—they’re so stretched even with funding I don’t feel like—
they’re not even paying their [laughs] staff, you know, and they have, you know, multiple people to take care of. 
So, it is important just health-wise for the person you’re caring for. I think it’s just better for them to be at home. 
I: 
To be at home. 
P: 
Mmm hmm, yeah. 
I: 
And there’s such a disparity between the amount of money that you make and the amount of money 
the nurse makes, for example. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
I’m guessing you think they’re equally as important? 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
People contribute to the care in very important ways. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And I’m not really asking this any better than you did, but [laughing]— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Sarah Bigby. West Olive. 4.24.18
17
I2: 
No, yeah. It’s a tough thing. 
I: 
It is a tough issue. 
P: 
I know. Yeah, and I don’t know what to say. I don’t know what to say. 
I: 
It is a tough issue, and it’s why people ae struggling to address the issue because it’s complicated and 
it is tough. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
But there’s this sort of big question about where should the resources be going? Should they be going 
to home care? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
And what’s the most effective care for the money, you know. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
What’s going to help people stay in their home the most in a healthy way. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, you’re part of the equation. 
P: 
Mmm [laughs]. 
I: 
This is the national discussion right now, right here. Unless you can think of a better way to phrase 
that? 
I2: 
We just had to ask you because you could have given us the solution. 
P: 
[Laughing] [group laughter] well, that’s what I thought you were looking for, and I was like I’m not—I
