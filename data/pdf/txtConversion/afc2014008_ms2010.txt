kj s

seventies and I explored the implications of what our shared traditiona repertoires
 
seemed to mean to us, I myself began to come to grips with a thought that had never
 
occurred to me before.  How totally remarkable it i
s that folklore -
-
 whether song or
 
story, rhyme or proverb -
-
 actually does manage to survive over centuries when it i
s
 
so ordinary, when it i>apParentlY so dull and shop-worn, when it receives SOMOM 
so l
ittle conscious or organized or official attention.
 
Let me take you through an example that I used to use in my introductory
 
folklore classes.
 I
ts total triviality is actually what makes it so interesting.
 
Suppose you and I were walking out one evening just after sunset, perhaps going across
 
the campus for supper.  We don't know each other very well, and there are lots of silence
 
between us that are beginning to become a l
ittle awkward.  Both of us are beginning to
 
cast about for something to say.  But the western skies are wide and beautiful and
 
compel our attention, and we can walk along compan onably looking at them in silence.
 
Finally, a glimmer of a star appears, the first of the night to come.  What might pop
 
into your head to say?  
 
Starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight
 
I wish I may, I wish I might, have the wish I wish tonight...
 
I very much doubt there i
s a person in this room who didn't think this before
 
I said it.  This i
s because we share, at leastX in part, a common identiy, because we
 
are of the same large group or gamily of human beings.
 If you did not think of this
 
rhyme, you are no better nor worse than anyone e
lse, you are simply of a different
 
family.  And if I k
r w your identity, I could stil ring your chimes, as they say, with
 
a different formula.
 
Now isn't this extraordinary?  Think about it for a minute.  Here we sit
 
in a room, maybe a hundred of us, from many places across the nati m, gathered
 
together serendipitously for this one night only, many of us never to see each other
 
again, and still every brain in this room clicks through the miracle of almost
 
instantaneous seriatim neurological synapses that we call memory and comes up with

willing to
 
base my future intellectual work on the premise that it is joined to a number of other
 
similarly undislodgeable cultural items that go a long way to making up m y  cultural

 In other words, you could probably define a 20th century middle American (
not
 
a very easy thing to do, by the way) by postulating that he/she is a person who knows
 
starlight starbright and the tune of the Bear Went Over the Mountain and For He's a

schematic diagram through which one s fundamental postulates, one's basic understandings
 
of the way the world works and the way life is, are all made clear, both to oxxx oneself
 
and to others.  We all desperately need to know and to be reminded occasionally who we

such fun to collect.
 
In some way or other, then, I believe that starlight starbright has something
 
to say about me and who I am -

what I do.  I will never stop wondering about the power of folklore, the mystery of
 
the incredible stability-in-the-midst-of-changing of those bits and pieces of communicat
 
and how they signal in such a delicate way the cultural condition, and how their accurat
 
analysis can be a key to the mystery of cultural differences.  Folklore -

one's common stock of tales, proverbs, superstitions, symbols, rhymes, songs, dances,
 
riddles, blessings, curses, rituals, ceremonials, beliefs, legends, place names, and

across time and space.

n
 
traditions will cont i1ally change about just as your common circumstances contihually
 
change about.  But overall, it seems to me that the comdition of a folkloric—
-
--i
 
can -
-
 and often does -
-
 s
ignal the condition of a culture in the plainest of ways.
 
Let me give you an example of a folkloric event I experienced that had gone through
 
enormous changes but had still survived and wa'still recognizable and was s
till bearing
 
witness to what i
t was going through.
 
I
t was a long t
ime ago, 1
975 to be exact; according to the ancient Chinese
 
calendar, it was the Year of the Rabbit.  I happened to be teaching in an anthropology
 
department in a greater Los Angeles college at the time and happened to read in the
 
newspaper about the l
ocal Chinese-American parade through Chinatown that heralded in
 
the beginning of that year.  I
've never been able to forget the description.  The
 
-5 -
parade was led by a phalanx of Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle  policemen.
 
Next came a United States Marines military band and color guard, with massed s
tars
 
and stripes held high.  Then there was an open sedan, almost completely hidden by a
 
bevy of costumed Playboy bunnies, who cooed and coiled around the Grand Master of
 
the Los Angeles Chinese-American News Years Day Parade -
-
 Hugh Hefner, the Big Rabbit
 
himself -
-
 who sat in the back seat waving to the spectators.  Followsing him, on foot,
 
was an untidy straggle of passionate and plainly furious Chinese matrons, holding up
 
home-made signs protesting (
the reporter was told) the outsiders' joke, and shouting
 
their anger in a variety of local Chinese dialects.  The ultimate peace of the affair
 
was guaranteed by a concluding display of yet more Los Angeles motorcycle officers.
 
There was no more. Th
 C
±  tX5 t t  LLI
 
Colleagues and friends had varying opinions on the event.  No one particularl)
 
defended what had happened, but many said in effect, "Well, if that's what '
they' want,
 
who are we to say '
they' shouldn't get it?  The thing must have been sponsored by
 
local Chinese-American business interests, and those folks must have l
iked it, though
 
the more o
ld-fashioned traditional, Chinese plain'y didn't.  Won' t i
t be interesting to
 
see which faction comes out on top?  Maybe we ought to put a couple of graduate students
 
on to it?"  And I got a depressing vision of squads of anthropology students sitting
 
about being terribly interested in the decline of ancient Chinese customø and tabulating
 
all its potentially variant outcomes s like some super-hyper cultural horse race.  And
 
I think it was then that I discovered that what I really was was a public sector folklor i
.
 
I think I had been one all along.  I have never been able to see how people
 
can actively think of folklore outside the public arena.  By its every definition, by
 
its inherent provenience, by its name itself, folklore simply is non-private; it i
s knowr
 
at least to more than one; it i
s not original nor individualistic.  It i
s incorrigibly
 
of, by, and for the group, be the group l
arge or small.
 
Months, though, after the Los Angeles Chinese-American parade, I found I was
 
still worrying over the episode, still feeling obscurely guilty.  What had actually
 
-6 —
 
happened there?  What v4 m& or unspoken messages had been received by the Los
 
Angeles Chinese community?  Why had they apparently felt that their especial
 
long-time cel$brational ways -
-
 their dragon dances, their banging brasses, their
 
special red costumes, their throwing lettuce about and all the rest of it -
-
 were
 
no longer interesting, wi worthy of replication, fulfilling, amusing, compelling
 
or even -
-
 God help us -
-
 profitable?  Perhaps they weren't even safe?  Chineseness,
 
\
,a4  c
ihf
 
they seemed to be saying, amwt be expressed publicly in up-to-the-minute American
 
terms.  Joking was surely more appropriate than seriousness.  Good Americans could
 
prove themselves such by self-ridicule and placatory displays of mainstream vulgarit
 
In later months, looking at similar celebratory events in other groups from
 
tribes to townships, I became ever more acutely aware that the act of public self-
presentation was a critical moment for minority (
and majority) communities, a time
 
when a huge number of important decisions had to be made.  In a way, every component
 
had to be agreed upon separately on each occasion:  what parts of the o
ld to keep,
 
which bits of the new to incorporate, what emotional tone should dominate, what over
 
message conveyed, how might the young, the old, the conservative, the avant-garde,
 
the rebellious) best be accomodated?  Each event was a l
iving cultural and social
 
self-portrait, almost always somewhat nervously projected, with a Cautious eye to
 
the beholders.
 
In some celebrations, self-parody triumphed, and mutual mis-understandings
 
and destructive stereotypes became seriou

f not even dangerously, crystallized.

 I believe
 
4L A
 e
 
was not only a turning-point in my own l
ife, but an important period in the developmi
 
of public sector folklox .,, The l
egislation creating the American Folklife Center,
 
-7
 
later to be Placed at the Library of Congress, was before the Congress.  The
 
Smitheonian Institution was deep in the planning of what was to be the most breath-
Vt  takingly original cultural event of the century -
-
 the l976
ctennial Festival
 
of American Folklife on the National Mall.  Those of us in this room who participate
 
in that incredible twelve-week-long assemblage, where for the first time i

a seriously considered attempt was made to recognize all the cultures in

ç j

were forever affected.  We will never 1W be the same again, and a good thing
 
too, I think.
 
There were so many festivals and galas and celebrations and old-timers days
 
&;
 
and ethnic and tribal bashes of all descriptions going on during tLe
.  f
 that I
 
recall a meeting that was initiated by a group of concerned folklorists
 1
977
 
to discuss whether or not this was a truly healthy situation.  As though we could do
 
anything about it.  As though the festival phenomenon was a professional folkloric
 
initiative.  Admittedly the 1976 Smithsonian extravaganza was an influential event,
 
planned and conceived by professional folklorists, anthropologists and ethnomusicolo
 
It was supposed to -

 and did
'
-
-
 set l
ots of how-to-do-it patterns, some of which
 
survived and some of which didn't, but it represented just the foamy crest of the
 
fundamental wave.  There were much deeper things going on.  Please remember that
 
you simply cannot make people do things they don't want to do over the long haulglmWN

During this same period, the National Endowment for the ArtsA d
 e
cided to take
 
seriously its responsibility to put some public money into the support of folk arts
 
as well as fine arts, and I had the good luck to get in on the early part of the action
 
Boy, did I learn a lot.  I learned that money -
-
 as I had always thought -
-
 was truly
 
a most deceptive and treacherous commodity; it did 4t even make a very reliable incenti
 
Many a time after an advisory panel of experts had voted not to fund an activity, we
 
discovered that the people went right on ahead and did i
t anyway.
 (
One panel, in awful
 
frustration about a really dreadful project, asked if we could vote an applicant some
 
money if he/she/they would just promise earnestly never to do the thing at all.)  Many
 
a time, after the Folk Arts staff had cArefully negotiated with an applicant group to
 
help them develop a scheme that we could fund under our guidelines, we found l
ater that
 
the entire event had been a disaster, because they hadn't really had our ideas in mind
 
anyway and thusAcarried them out sloppily or
 
Guidelines and policies, I began to realize, are as much determined by the
 
people who apply under them as by the people who formulate and administer them.  The
 
whole institution of a granting agency turns out to be a carefully and delicately
 
balanced and, in many respects, unspoken agreementx between the general public (
who
 
put up the cash) and the workers in a particular f
ield. I
n other words, the balance
 
of the power i
s s
till back there in the folklore and back there with the folks.

I kind of l
iked figuring this out, because I had been feeling for a l
ong
 
time that what was really going on down at the bottom -
-
 somewhat obscured by our
 
contentious, yeasty, egalitarian, pushy-shovy society -
-
 was a fundamental reaction
 
e
v
'
 
against the drive to sameness .k
 -
 -
 J by the overpowering energies
 
of burgenoning electronic computerization and electronic media.
 
The world had been cautiously walking up towards the great date of 1
984
 
and when we got there we had not l
iked what we saw.  We had looked at the world of
 
tomorrow, and we didn't think it was a
ll that special.  And I really believe that
 
W c
 
the people who
were l
iving in the United States at that time, a
long with the rest
 
of the world, began to back-pedal.  They began to say, stop.  We are not a
ll of a
 
single piece.  We are all of different pieces -
-
 individually and collectively.
 
You must speak to us as individuals and as special, even if temporary, collectives.
 
There are particular beauties .
about us as individuals and as collectives that must
 
be cherished and cared for.  We all belong to different collectives, and we a
ll have
 
to get in to the action.  In the Endowment, I began getting calls from people who
 
identified themselves as Ruthenians and as Irpinians (
I had to look them up in the , 
Encyclopedia).  But they were highly exercised over the fact that they were constantly
 
being lumped into festivals and programs as Ukranians or Italians.  We're different
 
from them, they said. We're special.
 
The National Endowment for the Arts began with enormous hesitation to present
 
National Heritage Fellowships to the l
iving exemplars of outstanding artistic traditions
 
We were terribly worried about doing this; we took, indeed, four years of repetitive
 
and agonizing panel debate to work out the f
irst tentative program.  We were afraid of
 
everything. We were afraid that the artists who were not selected would be angry with
 
the artists who were.  We were afraid that we would be sowing dissension rather than  
pride.  We worried we were incorrectly s
ingling out the individual from the group.
 
We worried we might not be using the correct criteria for judging the art.  We worried
 
and worried ,

So far I can assure you that our fears appear to have been groundless.
 
For one thing, we had forgotten about one of th  major patterns of our culture: the
 
periodic recognition of the individual through birthday celebrations, lottery winnings
 
and queen for a day programs.  All of our possible competing artists, as far as I can
 
tell, simply think: well, next time probably it will be my turn.  I can also tell you
 
this: of all the ways to fund folk artistry developed by the Folk Arts Program, this
 
has been far and away the most popular with the general American public.  What the Na-
tional Heritage Fellowship program seems to do is to make nationally visible the
 
artistry particular to one of our participating ethnic or vocational or religious groups
 
groups that we don't want to disappear into the mainstream, groups that thrust up
 
particularly skilled and creative indivivals to stand as their representatives, groups
 
that we always hope will continue adding their special unique genius to our future.
 
We l
ike, we savor, in many important ways we revere) our capacity to include differentnes
 
,t
rA
  
That capacity may actually turn out to be a vital factor in our i
U Wl survival;
_
_
 
And without sounding mystical, let me tell you that I don't think it was any
 
accident that the National Fellowship program got itself together and appeared at this
 
particular moment in history.  Nor was it any accident that the Folk Arts Program
 
itself took form in that most improbable host agency, the National Endowment for the
 
Arts which had been created e
ssentially to preserve and advance the f
inest of the f
ine
 
arts, the l
ikes of the American Ballet Theater, the Metropolitan Museum of Arts and

 a development no one woUld have thought possible twenty years ago.
 
I think that the development of public sector folklore was a cultural
 
corrective action that was as inevitable as the present-day continental drift or the
 
r
ee h
 r
'5o
.
 r
 
melting of the glaciers thousands of years ago.  People sometimes talk to me about
 
the "power" the Folk Arts Program has with i
ts three million dollars of grant money to
 
give out annually.  Such people are not up on present day population f
igures -
 or the
 
s
ize of most Washington agencies.  Myself, I feel l
ike a small wooden chip -
 okay maybe
 
a medium sized chip -
-
 floating down a river.  Only by the accident of coming up
 
against a fortuitously aligned series of rocks and branches can the chip I ride ever
 
begin to change the course of the river.  The power is still out there.  The power
 
is still in the folklore.  And to the degree to which you keep in touch with it and
 
love it and try to understand it, to that degree will you yourself be the stronger.
 
Let me say, before I close, a few especial words to the especial groups
 
in my audience tonight.  There are some folklorists here from both the public and the
 
academic sectors.
 Let me say to both groups:  we are important, we folklorists.  We
 
are not powerful, but we are important.
 I
t is time that we realize that what we say
 
matters, that what we say has impact and meaning in the world.
 I
t is time we took
 
ourselves seriously.  Ours is a dangerous but rewarding profession, because of the
 
strength of the materials with which we deal.  Our main problem i
s that none of is
 
knows enough, because there is so much to know...
 
I believe that those working within the public sector are responding to a
 
genuine cultural imperative.
 It i
s our responsibility to rise to that imp
rative
 
and to do our work the very best way we can conceive, seeing to it that the channels
 
of the future are kept broad enough so that all the varying parts of the stream -
-
o
ld, young, unheard of -
-
 get heard, and get heard at the top of their powers.  Those
 
of us in the academic sector have the responsibility of keeping faith with the truth
 
as it can be known across history.  And we also have the enormous responsibility of
 
training.  We must l
earn, I believe, to think about our students in new ways, not
 
simply as extensions of our own experiences, but as builders of the future.
 I
t i
s not
 
impossible to reconcile scholarship ad and hope.
 
Thwre are other people here who represent the interested public, individuals
 
who cared enough about the notions of tradition and culture to come here for a week's
 
discussion  or an evening's l
ecture.
 Let me recommend a special responsibility to you:
 
m
 -12 -
I
 
of learning how to be a good folklore audience; by which I mean respectful, caring,
 
txi i critical, and knowledgeable of the cultures that surround you and of which you
 
are a part.  Bear in mind that you may be dealing with somebody' e
lse's essentials,
 
somebody else's starlight, starbright.  We must go gently here.
 
But all of us together can do the primary thing.  We can all of us learn
 
to keep forever looking around us, moving over, making room, leaving some sociable
 
space, enduring some sociable silences, making sure that everybody i
s there, seeing
 
to it that every people have the possibility of remembering and preserving and changing,
 
if and as and when they want to, their own essentials.  That i
s the bottom l
ine.
 
Everything e
lse is decoration -
-
 important, but step two, not step one.
 
Let me try to make this all come together just a bit more sensibly by
 
telling you one last story that might stay with you a l
ittle while as it has stayed
 
with me.  Several years ago, a Sioux lady from Montana came to see me in my office
 
a
long with an ancient Sioux e
lder.
 I didn't know anything about Sioux anything.  But
 
I tried to l
isten carefully
 
1.
  
-

and speak respectfully and behave as I thought a public servant should behave.  F
inally
 
we ladies completed our particular business, and, just as we were getting ready to end
 
our conversation, the old gentleman said to me out of the blue .w(the first thing he
 
had said, really) ' his opaque eyes turned towards the window:  "Did you ever see a
 
tipi city?"  And there was a long pause.
 
It was late in the day and I was awfully tired and everybody e
lse had gone
 
home and I had this crazy feeling that I had been somehow transported into a Saroyan
 
play'. but I hadn't ever seen a tipi city, and I told him so.  "Oh, you ought to have
 
seen a tipi city," he told me, his old face shining with recollection.  "My father
 
showed me one time.  He woke me up in the middle of the night when I was just a l
ittle
 
boy, and he took me by the hand, and we walked all night long, all through the night.
 
And then i
n the first l
ight of morning, I saw a real tipi city shining as far as the eyc
 
could see.
 I
t was so beautiful, all white and pale -
-
 hundreds and hundreds of t
ipis...
 
And you know the wonderful thing about a tipi city?  You couldn't ever get lost in a
 
tipi city!  My father showed me.  If there were six poles or e
ight poles showing at the
 
top, that meant one tribe or the other.  And if there was a fox tail hanging from one
 
pole, that meant one clan, and if there was a turkey wing, that was another.  Once you
 
learned how it worked, you couldn't ever get l
ost in a t
ipi c
ity.
.. 
"
 And his t
ired
 
face beamed hopefully across the office.
 
I escorted the old gentleman and his young friend out into the Washington
 
streets, in which no turkey wing nor fox tail would ever indicate where they were,
 
in which so many of my felloW citizens would always be l
ost, hoping once again that the
 
disciplines that I have so long both joined and supported would rouse themselves in
 
their fu l
l vigor to interpret, mediate, and help preserve the human symbols that have
 
meant so much to human kind.  We don't know everything about how to do it, that i
s true,
 
but we do know something, we do know enough to go on with.  For this year i
s the year
 
of the Dragon, and in a few years, it will be the year of the Rabbit again
  
= 
According -to the ancient Chinese calendar, 1975 was the Year of the
 
Rabbit.
 I happened t
o be teaching in an anthropology department in a Los
 
Angeles college at the time and happened to observe the local Chinese-America
 
parade that heralded in the beginning of that auspicious year.
 It was an
 
instructive experience.
 
A phalanx of Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle policemen led off,
 
roaring their unmufflered engines and curvetting about over the sidewalks.
 
Next came a Marine military band and color guard, their massed American flags
 
high.  Then an open sedan, almost completely hidden by a bevy of costumed
 
Playboy bunnies who cooed and coiled around the Grand Master of the Los AngelE
 
Chinese-American New Years Day Parade —  Hugh Hefner, the Big Rabbit himself -
 
who sat in t
he back seat waving to the spectators.  Following him, on foot,
 
was an untidy and passionate straggle of Chinese matrons, holding up home-madE
 
signs protesting (
I was t
old) the outsider's joke and shouting their anger in
 
a variety of local Chinese dialects.  The ultimate peace of the affair was
 
guaranteed by a concluding display of yet more Los Angeles motorcycle officers.
 
There was no more.
 
Colleagues and friends had varying opinions on the event.  No one
 
particularly defended what had taken place but many said in effect, "Well,
 
if that's what '
they' want, aho are we to say '
they' shouldn't get it?  It
 
must have been sponsored by local Chinese-American business interests and
 
those folks must have liked i
t though the more old-fashioned traditional
 
Chinese p
lainly didn't.  Won't i
t be interesting to see which faction comes
 
out on t,
-)
p?" And I got a depressing vision of squadrons of anthropology students
 
sitting ab
 out being t
erribly interested in the decline of ancient Chinese custom
 
and tabulating all its potential variant outcomes like some super-hyper cultural
 
horse race.
 
2
 
' I
 
Months later I found I was still worrying over the episode, still feeling
 
obscurely guilty.  What had gone so terribly wrong?  What spoken or unspoken
 
messages had been received by the Los Angeles Chinese?  Why had they apparently
 
felt that their especial long-time celebrational ways were no longer vivid,
 
interesting, worthy, dramatic, fulfilling, amusing, or even just plain profitable?
 
Chinese-ness, they seemed to be saying, must be expressed publicly in up-to-the-
minute American terms; joking was surely safer than seriousness; good Americans
 
could prove themselves such by self-ridicule and placatory displays of mainstream
 
vulgarities.
 
In looking at similar celebratory events in other small groups from tribes
 
to townships in subsequent months, I became ever more firmly convinced that
 
the act of public self-presentation was a critical moment for minority communities,
 
a time when a hupt number of important decisions had to be made.
 In a way,
 
every component had to be agreed upon separately on each occasion:  what parts
 
of the old to keep, which bits of the new to incorporate, what emotional tone
 
should dominate, what overall message conveyed, how might the young, the old,
 
the conservative,  the avant-garde best be accommodateal  Each event was a living
 
up-to-the-minute cultural and social self-portrait, almost always somewhat
 
nervously projected, with a cautious eye to the outside beholders.
 
In some celebrations, self-parody triumphed, and mutual mis-understandings
 
and destructive stereotypes became dangerously crystallized.
 In others, a few
 
tentative mutual reassurances surfaced, and it began to seem that, just as all
 
immigrants and country people were not happy peasants nor singing/dancing
 
throngs, neither were all middle-class majority folks brainless boobs or yahoos.
 
For one thing, we were all attending each other's celebrations. At Old Settlers'
 
Days or Portuguese festas, all of us insiders and outsiders seemed to me to be
 
looking for something interesting, something outside and extra to our ordinary
 
lives, or why had we taken the trouble to come?  All of us wanted to experience
 
3
 
/
 
and learn; all of us were educable.  Maybe these omnipresent cultural displays
 
could turn out to be a domain where the insights of anthropology and folklore
 
would prove to be of some special mediating use.
 
All these experiences and thoughts were still churning about in me when
 
the National Endowment for the Arts, a federal granting agency, invited me to
 
direct its Folk Arts Program some years later.
 I accepted with possibly
 
unbecoming alacrity.  My predecessor had defined the
 4
 an advisory
 
group of scholars and savants was in place.  We were finally going to be able
 
to put some money where our mouths had been; but first we needed to announce
 
publicly what we imagined we were going to do.
 Our initial brochure commenced
 
bravely:
 
The folk and traditional arts are those that have grown through
 
time within the many sub-groups that make up any nation -
-
 groups
 
that identify themselves as sharing the same ethnic heritage, language
 
occupation, religion, or geographic area.
 Every Iroquois, :
-Louisiana
 
Cajun, and Mennonite represents a people who have developed a
 
distinctive expressive system, a body of important works of art, and
 
an assembly of respected practitioners of those art forms, all cherished
 
and valuable.
 
Our responsibility, we said, was:
 
the encouragement of those community or family-based arts that have
 
endured through several generations and that carry with them a sense
 
of community aesthetic.
 
We woule meet this responsibility by;
 
identifying, assisting, and honoring local men and women of artistic
 
skill and traditional authority;
 
servicing the traditional communities in which such artists flourish
 
by providing support for their cultural activities; and

 Pm
 
enrich the lives of all Americans by i
naking. more visible the
 
sophistication, the vivacity, and the meaningfulness of our
 
multi-cultural heritage.
 
Five years later this formulation is still satisfying, still, in its
 
implications, maybe just a little bit thrilling.  Here it is, written down on
 
paper in an official document:  the United States has agreed that the encourage-
ment of its so-called small cultures is a matter of national importance.  The
 
establishment of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, the
 
Office of Folklife Programs at the Smithsonian Institution, and the Heritage
 
Preservation in the Department of the Interior are further evidences of this
 
' 4'
 
determination and of the long-awaited weakening of the melting-pot philosophy
 
within the federal government.
 These last years have seen real changes.
 
Within the Arts Endowment, during the five years that the Folk Arts
 
Program has been in existence, some two and a half million dollars have been
 
spent annually on projects in support of the Program's goals.
 These monies
 
have gone to tribes,  libraries, schools, artists associations, museums, and

artisans in concerts, festivals, and residencies;  to exhibit their work in
 
all kinds of public facilities; and to record and document their art for media
 
distribution and for preservation in local archives and libraries.
 Smaller
 
amounts of the Program's funds have been spent to set up apprenticeships through
 
which skilled artists can pass along their special knowledge and skills, and
 
to establish the National Heritage Fellowships, individual awards for senior
 
traditional artists who have made major contributions to their particular
 
art form.
 
5
 
A final effort has been the setting up of a network of graduate folklorists,
 
anthropologists, and ethnomusicologists attached to state agencies of various
 
kinds (
departments of cultural development, arts agencies, historical societies,
 
universities) all of them engaged in full time public sector work of the kind
 
just outlined.
 As of the present writing, there are some thirty-five such
 
positions in existence, scattered across the entire continental United States
 
and reaching out to Alaska, Hawaii and Guam.
 They do not pay as well as they
 
should, but the work is indisputably fascinating.
 
Five years is a very short period during which the effect of this kind .
of
 
activity can be judged.
 Though it may seem frivolous to say so, the fact is
 
that we've had only money to work with and never enough of that, and giving
 
money turns out to be a clumsy, slippery, pettifogging sort of way to make
 
anything interesting happen.
 Sometimes I feel as though we were trying to
 
repair a hi-fl system with a baseball bat.
 Still, we can report that a few
 
of our principles (
requirements, suggestions, notions) seem to b"
e viable, even
 
useful, maybe even proven.
 
For example, there is parity. 
This idea has been developed into an axiom,
 
a great advantage because the axiomatic does not have to be discussed all the
 
time.
 In our first brochure, we declared (
e
 f± h rJ' that the authentic and
 
venerable art forms traditional to any of our sub-cultures are in Principle
  
equivalent to any other, including those of the majority culture.
 In other
 
words, Comanche flute music and German lieder must be considered, in principle,
 
aesthetic equivalencies and of the same order of importance.
 This position is
 
difficult to refute without seeming undemocratic and in fact met with generally
 
interested agreement by most elements of the larger arts world.
 Consequently,
 
we have been able to move calmly towards helping redress at least some of the
 
inequities that actually exist in the non-theoretical world.
 
6
 
During a period when broadcasts in languages other than English have
 
been decreasing and when small record companies have been going bankrupt,
 
we have been able to help enliven the air with a few alternate sounds.
 For
 
example, the Zuni nation has produced twelve half-hour radio programs of
 
their traditional narratives recorded in the Zuni language for local broadcast.
 
In southwest Louisiana an even longer series of radio programs presents Cajun
 
speakers telling traditional Cajun stories to Cajun audiences, while in Alaska
 
the singing of the  pik people of St. Lawrence Island has been recorded on a
 
series of cassette recordings for local distribution along with a small
 
accompanying booklet containing the words of the songs and general information
 
concerning Yupik repertoire and style.  And in Memphis, Tennessee a reunion
 
and concert of Memphis-based old-time Black gospel quartets will soon take
 
place,  to be followed by an LP disc of their music, primarily for local
 
distribution.
 
All these projects are based on the principle of feedback, which is probably
 
the most consistent feature of our work.
 The notion of feedback should be
 
seen as an orderly development out of the situation in which native people all
 
over the world have found themselves, with too many of their possessions gracing
 
museums and archives in other continents, and too little of the information they
 
had offered being returned to them in any useful form.
 
Most anthropological and folkloric investigators now routinely provide
 
copies of all materials recorded to their host communities.
 But in a media
 
world, contact sheets and field notes are simply a part of the record, a bare
 
beginning.  A.Chitimacha basket properly displayed, lit, photographed, and
 
presented in a full page, full-color slick-paper reproduction in an art magazine
 
can look just as elegant as any museum's prize Chippendale chair; a group of
 
Albanian-Americans improiizing harmonies in a local  cafe,  if properly miked
 
and well recorded, can be as sonorously thrilling as any madrigal ensemble.
 
7
 
But the presentational effort has to be made, and local presentation in a
 
totally professional style has to be planned into any project from the beginning,
 
or it will somehow not occur.
 
Some of the most interesting projects the Folk Arts Program has contributed
 
to were initially planned exclusively for feedback purposes.
 Touring companies
 
made up of the finest, most elegant performers of a particular ethnic or
 
regional group have been booked across the country into ethnic communities that
 
had been cut off from the older parts of their heritage or where there were
 
only a few traditional performers who were getting little local validation of
 
their art.
 The tour performances aimed in part t
o increase these local performers t 
self-esteem by attracting wider audiences to their art form and by enabling
 
A
 
them and their audjences to develop artistically through being in first-hand
 
contact with the finest musicians, singers and dancers of their particular ethnicity.
 
Irish, Greek,  Italian, Appalachian, Yiddish, French, Ozark, Sephardic and
 
Mexican tours featuring exclusively traditional performers have criss-crossed
 
the United States in the last few years, purposely booked into local community
 
halls as opposed to, say, university campuses,
 It is difficult to pinpoint the
 
exact result of these ventures, but there are many more audience requests than
 
tours to respond to them, and, at least in the Irish community, many more young
 
people are taking up the older styles than before.
 
Mick Moloney, organizer of three consecutive Irish tours, points out that
 
until ten years ago Irish traditional arts had been kept alive almost exclusively
 
by first generation immigrants; and if the sons and daughters of those traditional
 
artists identified with Irish cultura at all, it was with the commercialized
 
hybrid forms popularized by the media.
 Now, in New York City alone, there are
 
over 5000 young Irish Americans, all in their teens, taking weekly lessons from
 
senior artists in traditional Irish music and dance.
 Several have gone to
 
8
 
Ireland from a variety of American cities for the annual competitions in
 
traditional music and dance there, and they have won all-Ireland championships,
 
causing major consternation in the home country.  Moloney feels that, though
 
other factors were undoubtedly at work In the recent Irish renaissance, the
 
tours performed two essential functions -
-
 validating traditional Irish culture
 
by presenting it under federal sponsorship, and bringing it to a wider audience
 
across the country.
 
An editorial digression might be useful at this point.
 Some culturologists
 
•
,
 
have expressed concern upon hearing of developments such as those described,
 
They seem to feel that the federal government is taking an unhealthy
 
hand in minority affairs by promoting the older traditional art forms and
 
messing about with "normal" cultural processes.
 Somehow there is a sense that
 
the muscular
 federal arm is forcing cultural conformity on people by
 
holding out the carrot of federal grants.  My own view is quite the Opposite:
 
I feel that our efforts are increasinR cultural autonomy by inc
asing the
 
available range of interesting cultural choices that an ethnic or regional
 
community has before them.
 Looking specifically at the Irish-American picture
 
since the revival of traditional Irish music and dance, I cannot see that there
 
PtC.fg
t
 
has been one whit less on the part of the Irish-American community in Joyce,
 
1
4
 
Synge or Dunsany, nor has one fewer tankard of green beer been consumed on
 
St. Patrick's Day.  Most ethnic,  tribal, and regional people seem to like all
 
the aspects of their culture, if they're just left to it, and move happily
 
back and forth between classic, popular and folk.
 The problem is, or has been,
 
that the classic and popular arts have support systems that the folk (
traditional)
 
have developed only lately, and in small part.
 
There, are two additional ideas in our l
ittle bag of tricks that might be
 
of interest to cultural activists.
 The first is the emphasis on authentic
 
models. 
We have from the beginning insisted upon authenticity as a primary
 
1
1
 
9
 
criterion because it represents, in ways that only the most exhaustive analyses
 
can ferret out, the vital conservative core of any people's being, the burning
 
heart of radiant energy that will ensure forever that until the last Inupiaq
 
or Ukranian or Ashanti or Down-easter dies there will always be -
-
 thank God -
-
some element of their cultural uniqueness left alive in the world.
 
Theirs is no dead weight from the past, no useless cultural lumber.  When
 
interpreted by senior artists who are themselves the embodiment of the tradition,
 
these skills point directly at the heart of the matter as it stands at present,
 
in addition to giving us clues as to what may come next.
 It is possible, of
 
course, for a skilled craftsman to copy, point by point, an authentic object,
 
creating a replica that cannot be told from the original.  What that same
 
craftsman cannot do is to foreshadow, as the great authentic artists generally
 
4 a
.
dwf
lAewn 
—
 
the future.
 It is for this reason that we are now funding a documentary
 
film that will present four decades of continuity and change in the art and
 
life of the Navajo, most especially their silversmithing and weaving.
 The
 
inclusion of footage of crafts methods shot by film-maker/anthropologist John
 
Adair in the 1930's will allow contemporary Navajo artisans to comment on and
 
demonstrate the processes of technological and aesthetic change.
 This is a
 
rare event.  We will hope to profit from it.

Ordinarily, senior traditional artists -
-
 our authentic models --,Saipan,
 
every one the same sad wish.
 They want to teach their own children and grand-
children their particular art form.
 They want to be in the schools.
 One would
 
think that would be an easy wish to gratify, but in practice it has been the
 
most difficult thing we have tried to do.  Neither Foxfire nor the entire
 
anthropological establishment has been able to breach the societal wall that
 
surrounds the education of our children.  We've done better to go round the
 
other way.
 We have honored, directly and personally, particular senior artists
 
10
 
through the National Heritage Fellowship program, an equivalent of the National
 
Cultural Treasures program of Japan.  We have hoped that federal accolades
 
given to such extraordinary artists as Philip Simmons (
Black ironworker from
 
Charlestown, South Carolina), Bill Monroe (
inventor and popularizer of blue
 
grass music) and Georgeann Robinson (
reviver and exponent of Osage ribbonwork)
 
could validate in a meaningful way both the art forms and the artists, allowing
 
the eventual breaching of just a few cracks in the educational battlements.
 
It all takes t
ime.  We've learned this before.  Appalachia, after all,
 
has been the center of folkloric research since the mid-nineteenth century
 
when the English folklorist 1 Cecil Sharp, hiked through the mountains, pencil
 
at the ready, writing down the traditional songs of Britain that had survived
 
in this new land.
 Through the years scores of investigators have followed him
 
until we now know more about Appalachian regional culture than that of any
 
other part
 of the United States.  As a result, the Folk Arts Program
 
has more solid applications from the southern mountain chain than from
 
t.

that has received the most money from the federal Folk Arts Program has
 
any other
 
state
 
been
 
the state of Tennessee.
 
The distribution of federal monies into Tennessee has had some particularly
 
practical results  Specifically, lots of local musicians and artisans are in
 
relatively good shape:
 their repertoires are fresh,  their skills are polished,
 
and they're ready to display their music and their wares alike,  During the
 
1982 Knoxville Worlds Fair they got a chance, somewhat surprisingly,  to do just
 
that, in what the New York Times .
called the "class act" of the Fair.
 There was
 
a whole section of the fairgrounds set aside for traditional arts and artists;
 
and when, after six months,  it all finally had to come to an end,  there was a
 
week of embracing and tears between white and black, f
latiander and mountaineer.
 
These were all country people, hillbillies, local yokels of a million bad comic
 
11
 
strips.
 But they had testified in such vivid ways to the interest and
 
importance of their art forms and their ways of life that in future months
 
the incoming Governor of Tennessee would put out a call in his inaugural
 
address for a "Tennessee Homecoming".
 "Let each of Tennessee's three thousand
 
communities," he declared, "copy Alex Haley and search out its community roots.
 
Turn off the television and start interviewing your grandparents on the front
 
porch while you still can...."  But it did take time
., and it will take time.
 
Our final strategy is framing, perhaps the most debatable of cultural
 
interventions.  Framing occurs when you suggest to a local artisan that what
 
she is doing is not taking care of a specific local need (
e.g. making something
 
to carry water in) but producing an art object with value above and beyond
 
the functional requirements.
 The problem here is that the artistic act is
 
thereby placed in an uncharted realm in the artisan's terms,  What, after all,
 
makes it an "art object" as opposed to something solid and practical -
-
 it is
 
color, shape, regularity, irregularity, technique, pattern, material -
-
 just
 
s
 c
.*tm. 4s
 
what?
 Some cuut1iutj  Indian t,i1ipr, have determined that Maria Martinez' San
 
Ildefonso pottery was made valuable by the fact that it was black, and they have
 
therefore painted their own pottery black,  to no especial response from the
 
buyers' market.
 It is a risky i
nanouevre, and must be carefully plotted.
 
In the Folk Arts Program, we spend a lot of time framing, saying in
 
effect, "Hey you didn't know it, but what you're doing isn't just basket
 
making or embroidery or fiddling, it's art!" It sometimes makes us nervous.
 
On bad days we think of framing as "the ultimate co-option of the innocent by
 
a society that is determined to make a buck out of everything it touches,
 
turning every act into a packageable and saleable commodity.
 On good days we
 
hope that we are providing smaller cultures with a defense mechanism whereby
 
they can protect their art forms and carry them into the future..."

I wrote those lines three years ago,
 They are still true.  A few months
 
ago a Sioux lady came to see me along with an ancient Sioux elder.  We ladies
 
completed our business, and just as we were getting ready to end the conversation,
 
the old gentleman said to me, out of the blue, his opaque eyes turned towards
 
the window, "Did you ever see a tipi city?"  And there was a long pause.
 
I hadn't ever, and I told him so.
 "Oh, you ought to have seen a tipi city",

time.
 He woke i

light of morning, I saw a tipi city -
