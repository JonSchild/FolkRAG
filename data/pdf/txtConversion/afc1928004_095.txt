Biography of Flughey Dougherty. 
The subject of our sketch first saw daylight on 
July 4th, 1844 (in Philadelphia). as Hughey says, 
" 
in time to celebrate the great national haday." 
Hughey first appeared as a 
jig-dancer with a 
por-
tion of the Old Virginia Serenaders at the Adel-
phi Hall, corner of Filth and Adelphi streets, 
Phil. 
His debut was a 
complete success, and 
Hughey, flushed with success, sought other fields. 
He then appeared at Southwark Hall, dancing 
with the lamented Jo' n Diamond. He then ap-
peared at Sandford's Opera House ( now Carncross 
and Dixey's) tor several years. 
Hughey's star 
was now in the ascendant, and he travelled through-
out the country, delivering 
his famous stump 
speech, which has made him so popular. 
Any one 
who has sat and listened to that " speech " will 
bear testimony that it is the finest oration of non-
sense coupled with sentimentalism ever 
heard 
within the 
IA a'Is where " burnt, cork " reigns. 
Hughey has appeared with Sam Sharpley's Min-
strels, Sktff and Gaylord, Frank River's Melodeon, 
and was the reigning favorite at the Morris Broth-
ers, B 
ston. 
At last he held the managerial reins 
in company with Wild Barney and Mac, and the

troupe was in all respects the finest one seen for 
many years. 
Hughey is now connected with Du-
prey and Benedict's Minstrels, where he amuses 
the thousands who flock nightly to hear this anions 
troupe. 
Everywhere he has been received with 
shouts of applause, an] he has estab'ished himself 
as a 
favorite throughout the United States - Mr. 
Dougherty in deportment is the ideal of a 
getle-
man, able to converse upon any subject, and, iii 
fact, a 
very sociable eomnanion. 
He has a 
great 
many warm friends, and has a 
happy way of keep-
ing them. 
Mr. Dougherty is unmarried, having 
twice refused the hand of Queen Vi toria. 
To 
".linger longer" is useless.

Thro' the &irk night, and thick falling snow, 
Trembling and fearful alone to and fro, 
St 11 waiting and honing with tear moist-ned eve, 
That some one w uld see her nice apples and buy, 
Will no kind soul ' mong the thick passing thong, 
Ever pity the poor helidess girl so ! orlorn, 
Oh no in the cold blast this night she may lie, 
Left all alone uncared for to die. 
Will no one heed my feeble cry, etc..

And the lazy roan finds no excese for his sin, 
If he lives to thrf,e.core and has nothing raked in.

Dame Nature her treasures refnses to yield, 
Whuie th sties and tliorns fill his cup to the brim,

The smith st the anvil ne'er tir ,s

Though ° filmes he thinks that it comes very

He has found that ' tis patience the harvest cloth 
bring, 
While he's singing and pounding and raking it in. 
Though thousands of stitches he'll take each day, 
The tailor knows in the end it will pay. 
No chances he loses while time's on the wing, 
But always keeps stitching and raking it in. 
Since fashion her banners unfur"ed to the breoze, 
Of greenbacks it takrs a 
big harveq of sheaves 
To buy all her notions, extravagant thing, 
Tho' he toil night and day, it would beggar a

With Wecian it captures our ladies in bend, 
With velocipetks maniacs make of the men : 
The pocket once portly grows languid and thin, 
For she rakes fifty out where we rake twenty in.

Grow in the field, and not in the grove.

CHORUS. 
In the sky the bright stars glittered, 
On the grass the moonlight shone, 
From Aunt Dinah's quilting party 
I 
was seeing Nellie home. 
When the autumn tinged the greenwood, 
Turning all its leaves to gold, 
In the lawn by the elders shaded, 
I 
my love to Nellie told. 
On• the star- bespangled dome, 
How I 
blessed the August evening,, 
As we stood together gazing, 
When I 
saw sweet Nellie home. 
In the sky, eta. 
White hairs mingle with my tresses, 
Furrows stealing on my brow, 
But a 
love-smi e 
cheers and blesses 
Life's declining moments now.

Closer to my bosom come, 
Tell me, dost thou still remember 
When I 
saw thee; sweet Nellie, home?
