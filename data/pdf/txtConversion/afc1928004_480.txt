Murphy's Dream. 
Written by GEORGE M URPHY, and performed by GEORGE and Jontl 
M URPHY. 
George and John Murphy stayed out a 
whole night, 
And the truth is they drank too much beer, 
And when they got home they both were so tight, 
That both of their heads felt quite queer. 
" 
Let's sit down and rest ourselves," George said to John ; 
" 
Let's try and recollect where we've been ;" 
So they sat down, but, oh, in a 
minute or two, 
They were asleep and beginning to dream. 
Now dreaming is funny—your mind wanders away— 
Some dream they are a 
king, some a 
goat, 
Why, I 
dreamt Cother night, peculiar to say, 
I 
was an engine on the elevated railroad. 
But the Murphys they dreamed that in Paris they were, 
Looking for a 
first-class hotel, 
In their valises was gold, but how it got there 
Neither of the Murphys could tell. 
They dreamt George was a Dutchman, and that his name 
was Jake, 
With his clothes tore, and bald-headed at that, 
That John was an Irishman, and from jail he did break, 
That his name wasn't John, but was Pat ; 
Among lunatics surely they thought that they were, 
Who they tried to kill, strange it did seem ; 
That they were arrested and caught in a 
snare, 
This the Murphys all saw in their dream. 
They dreamt to the gallows they both had to go, as their 
sentence was they had to die ; 
That they mounted the scaffold, John quickly, George slow, 
and that neither attempted to cry. 
They dreamt that hanging them wasn't severe, 
But imagined that it would cause lots of fun ; 
That the soldiers and sheriffs all stood quite near, 
To make sure that the murderers were hung •, 
They dreamt that the trap fell and that they were dead, how 
strange the sensation did seem, 
But the truth was the beer had got into their heads and 
caused such a 
ridiculous dream,

Don't Marry a 
Man if He Drinks. 
Music of this Song to be obtained at norace Waters' Music Store, 
No. 481 Broadway, New York, 
YOUNG 
ladies, pray listen to Inc, 
And. keep just as quiet as mice, 
While I 
sing you a 
song, it is not very long, 
Which contains quite a 
piece of advice. 
Spoken—It is this: 
No matter what people may say, 
No matter what somebody thinks; 
If you wish to be happy the rest of your days, 
Don't marry a 
man if he drinks, 
Dont marry a 
man if he drinks. 
lic3 may be so handsome and gay; 
And have such a 
beautiful voice; 
And may dance so divinely you'll feel in your heart 
That he must be the man of your choice. 
If his accen ts are tender and low, 
And sweeter than roses and pinks, 
And his breath quite a 
different thing, you may know 
Your exquisite gentleman drinks. 
'Tis no matter, &a 
Just think of the sorrows and cares, 
The heart-rending sighs and the fears, 
Of the words aud the blows, and the cruelest woes, 
And then think of an ocean of tears. 
Think of Toodles, the drunkest of men, 
His attitudes, hiccoughs, and winks— 
And then think what a 
dignified pair you will make, 
If you marry a 
man and he drinks. 
'Tis no matter, &a 
Young ladies, look well to your hearts, 
Don't throw them away on a 
sot; 
Or a 
man who is given to treating his friends, 
Whate'er be his station or lot. 
Though his pride may uphold him 
Yet sooner or later he sinks; 
Then if you would be happy the rest of your days, 
Don't marry a 
man if he drinks. 
‘'Tis no matter, & o.

DON'T pine away throughou the day, 
Nor grieve about the morrow; 
The man who takes a 
load of care 
Is sure to gain some sorrow. 
W le thro' the Path of Life you go, 
Shrink not beneath a 
cloud, 
But show yourself a 
solid man, 
. And rise above the crowd! 
CITORIIS. 
(let your head above the crowd, 
And with courage be endow'd; 
Never seek for care, but, with laughing alr, 
Meet the world so stern and proud! 
If you seek for love or fame, 
Or a 
grand and an I 
lofty name, 
Make a 
gallant fight for the end so bright—. 
Get your head above the crowd ! 
In ev'ry struggle we endure 
In ev'ry game we're playing 
Of chances we are never sure 
And things oft look dismaying 
3ut we should never falter then 
Tho fate seems cold and proud 
flur motto should be: " Do and Dare !" 
Till we rise above the crowd. 
Get your head, tit. 
When Washington his battles fought, 
He let no trouble blind him, 
But gained the freedom which he son„ht, 
And glories left behind him; 
He did not mourn a 
day's defeat, 
But thro' the dangers plow'd; 
It was his glory and his aim 
To rise above the crowd. 
Get your head, 4i.c,

Dutch Song and Dance. 
Written and sung by JOHN RUSSELL. 
My name is Jacob Snider, 
I 
keep a 
bier saloon; 
Sell lager bier and cider, 
And have free lunch at noon. 
But bums they do come in there 
And buy one glass of bier, 
You ought to see them tackle that lunch, 
And see it disappear. 
They eat up all my crackers, (Symph.) 
And beg all my tobacco. 
You ought to see them eat, oh my! 
But now I 
think I'll fix them—I've got a 
kidney stew, 
It's made of second- handed pants, some tooth brushes and 
glue. 
(Dance.) 
Now there's a 
little rooster— 
On his back he has a 
hunch— 
I 
know he will come to-morrow 
And eat up all my lunch. 
But when that glue gets cold in him, 
Won't there be lots of fun I 
It will glue his stomach up so tight 
And kill that son of a 
gun.

Ohl we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is or, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in tm, past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow. 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would fall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain; 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Mn like a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall see 
again. 
Oh! they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget; 
All the vows we pledged together, 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Aui! the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
So, thro' all the future years, 
I'll love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would.

TERRIBLE TIMES FOR SHEENEYS. 
Written and Sung by SAM DEVERE. 
Copyright, A. J. 
FISHER, 18'78. 
To Saratoga's Grand Hotel, 
The Sheeneys one day all flew pell mall, 
But the clerk he told them to go to — well 
He had no rooms for Sheeneys. 
Ther. all the Sheeneys got terrible sore. 
They made a 
kick and the clerk he swore, 
He' i 
bounce them all right out of the door. 
'Twas terrible times for Sheeneys. 
CHORUS. 
Now Moses and Levi and Isaac all stand, 
On Chatham Street, looking for greenys. 
Set a 
country man afloat 
With a " hand-me-down " coat. 
That's elegant graft for the Sheeney's 
There was Moses in the clothing line, 
And Isaacs too who sold snyde wine. 
They swore the clerk wic- a 
dirty swine. 
'Twas terrible times for Sheeneys. 
There was Jacobs who kept the jewelry store. 
Along with two or three hundred more. 
Got full of Dutch beer and kicked and swore. 
'Twos terrible times for Sheeneys. 
Solomon the butcher so big and stout 
And Levi who lad three balls hung out ; 
All yelled for revenge with a 
terrible shout. 
"I' was te:rib!e times for Shecneys. 
Mr. Cohen who sold old stcond-hand clothes, 
And Abraham with the terrible nose, 
Cried out—" For vy is de reason of dose." 
Oh, terrible times for Sheeneys. 
Put a 
Headstone O'er Poor Mother's Grave. 
Oh, Willie, dear Willie, our mother is dead, 
Our mother whom we loved so dear; 
She's sleeping to-night in her cold, cold grave, 
No more will she be with us here. 
How happy we were when by the fireside, 
With mother we'd sit all alone; 
And what stories she'd tell to both you and I, 
Tint now she has left our dear home. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, mother has gone to Heaven above, 
And there's one thing of you I 
would crave; 
As children should do for a 
mother s true— 
Put a 
headstone o'er her beloved grave. 
How often, when sickness kept us in our beds, 
Not a 
friend in the world could we find 
lIslf so good as our mother, who'd sit by our side, 
And to us be so gentle and kind. 
Yes, morning and night, she'd watch our sick brows, 
Never thinking of rest; 
But now she has left us alone hero to weep, 
And gone to the land of the blest. 
Yes, mother has gone, stg.

Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
be meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been proionged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of qeestions anl answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact melees further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
