Roberta Hill:  I am Roberta Hill. I am Oneida. I am a poet and fiction writer and scholar, and the 
poem is called “These Rivers Remember.” 
 
[Roberta Hill reads “These Rivers Remember”] 
 
RH:  My commentary is this: Songs, singing, music, dance were incredibly important to Native 
people throughout the whole hemisphere. And if colonization had paid more attention to 
Native life and Native ways of doing things, all of us would be singing, and we’d be very 
interested in each other’s songs. Everyone would have their own song, and maybe several 
songs, depending on their experience. And so this was a singing hemisphere. 
 
This particular poem relates to the sense of visibility and persistence and resistance and 
acknowledgement because the Dakota have been involved in remembering and commentaries 
of this particular incident that is referenced in the poem, which is the Dakota War, 1862 to 
1865. And the reasons for the war—the Dakota declared war—were that their people were 
hungry. Because the annuities they were to have from the treaties—the treaties in exchange 
for land gave them some supplies and those supplies were not forthcoming. One particular 
agent denied them their food. And so the young warriors’ families, and the warriors were 
starving, and so they started to strike the invading settlements, trying to find food. 
 
I’ll just go through the comments that I’ve written in the back of the collection in which this 
poem is published. It’s in Cicadas: New and Selected Poems from Holy Cow Press. And as I’ve 
written about “These Rivers Remember,” the poem refers to Dakota villages and ways of life 
before white settlement. It refers to the Dakota-U.S. War of 1862.  
 
The Science Museum Park Project incorporated lines of the poems written by poets from 
communities of color into a small park on Robert Street in St. Paul. When they did that and 
when we lived there—when I lived there with my family—in 1987 through 1997 or 96, there 
were many projects for reconciling the white population that was there and the populations of 
people that had moved into the Twin Cities and into Mankato, particularly, and with the Dakota 
people whose reservations were south, farther away from those areas. We have to remember 
that in this period of time, of the U.S.-Dakota War, the U.S. annulled the treaties that were the 
basis of the Dakotas agreeing to land loss. And so, the warriors had struck up went in to fight. 
As a result, over 1,600 Dakotas, people, were rounded up and put into a concentration camp at 
Fort Snelling. So, the result of that was that 303 Dakota warriors were supposed to be hanged 
at Mankato. Only 38 were, which is the largest mass hanging in the U.S. And so this poem 
reflects the persistence and the resistance and the need for memory and the idea that the 
Earth itself has memory and helps people remember. When you walk upon her, there are times 
when you will feel a kind of a memory come into you.  
 
As I learned more about the Dakota War, I had the great gift of meeting with Dr. Chris Mato 
Nunpa, who taught me the Dakota words and corrected my spelling and provided translations 
of Dakota words. So, Bde-wa’-kan-ton-wan is the name of one of the fires of the Isanti Dakota 
and it means “dwellers by mystic lake.” The Dakota word I-mni-za-Ska translates as “white 
cliffs” and it is the name for St. Paul. Kangi Ci’stin’na means “little raven” and it refers to the 
warrior and chief who was called Little Crow, and was considered the leader of the conflict. 
After the war, during the wartime, as the U.S. calvary came in and began to kill off the Dakota 
people and drive them away, Little Crow, or really his real name is Little Raven, was looking for 
some food and was trying to gather some berries, and he was shot in the back and died. Ha-ha 
Wa’-kpa is one possible translation for “river of the falls” and it refers to Saint Anthony Falls, 
which I don’t think exists anymore, because there’s a bridge there and people coming, you 
know, traffic coming, into the Minneapolis area don’t see the falls anymore. And Maka coka-ya 
kin or Makoce coka-ya kin is the confluence where the Minnesota River meets the Mississippi. 
And Dr. Mato Nunpa explained the phrase or word can also be translated to mean “the center 
of the universe.” This fits in with the notion that the Dakota came from the stars. As many 
Native people believe, we come from the stars. Recent astronomical knowledge has increased 
our understanding that our very substances come from stars and nebulae and from the 
explosions that stars produce. So, the confluence itself is a sacred place, which is also called 
Bdo-te, and it was translated as “Mendota.”  
 
So, the reason I selected this poem was because of the recent events in St. Paul, Minneapolis. 
And I lived there for a number of years and found the place really very beautiful. And the sense 
then that there was this tremendous displacement of Native people and the resurgence and 
return of Native people and their reconciliation of trying to help people understand that they 
were also victims of the people coming in for settlement. There were a number of events and 
there still continues to be events that reclaim this memory, that reclaim the memory of the 
concentration camp at Fort Snelling, and reclaim the idea of the largest mass hanging in the 
U.S., of the 38 Dakota warriors who were really trying to help their families and protect their 
families and get food to their families. The Indian agent that denied people the food said at one 
point “Let the Dakota eat grass,” and so the warriors killed him and stuffed his mouth with 
grass to show that they understood what he was saying, that he was talking about letting them 
starve to death—possibly for his own advancement and greed. And so the memories of this is 
just one memory of many Native experiences in the country, of places that are special and 
sacred to Native people but end up then being lost because of colonization and settlement. The 
reason I selected it was because of the connection it has to Minneapolis and St. Paul. So, if 
you’re interested in more about the Dakota War, the U.S.-Dakota War, there’s many, many 
books written about it and more and more history written about it from the Dakota 
perspective, so I encourage you to find out more about it.
