PRIMROSE AND PRARIE FLOWER. 
Written by ARCHIE DELMANING expressly for LeSTER & ALLEN, and 
sung by them with great success all over the country, and by 
request at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE, Broadway, N. Y. 
The reason why we're dancing here, 
We will explain to you; 
We love two charming, pretty girls, 
To whom we will be true; 
The beauty that they both possess, 
Vie with the rose and pink; 
To-night we meet by the babbling brook, 
Where the wild birds, dip and drink. 
CHORUS: 
Oh, my, when we hear sweet music play, 
We love to dance and sing; 
It fills our hearts with great delight, 
To hear the heel taps ring; 
Their beauty is surpassed by none, 
We know you'd think the same; 
They dwell 'mid flowers rich and rare, 
Down yonder shady lane. 
[Break]. 
[Break]. 
We met one evening in July, 
In love's sweet peaceful bower; 
'Twas there and then we. called them both, 
Primrose and Prairie Flower; 
And since that time we've often met, 
'Twich blossoms white and pink; 
And told our love 'neath the stars above, 
Where the wild birds dip and drink. 
Let me look at an Oyster Stew

__Twelve Rafferty Blues, 
Written and sung with great success by LESTER & ALLEN. 
I 
once heard tell of a 
nice young man 
his name was Sammy Greens; 
He used to work in a 
Drug store, 
Painting pork and beans; 
He was so awful stylish, 
You ought to see him flirt; 
His neck- tie was a 
bed- quilt, 
And he had a 
pillow- ease for a 
shirt. 
He'd stand upon the corner, 
With a 
tooth- pick in his mouth; 
lied put you in mind of a 
dizzy swell, 
A (In: 1v from the South; 
His salary, seven dollars a 
year, 
lie wore a 
red straw hat; 
lie used to sleep on the roof of the river, 
To catch wind to try and get fat. 
It would break your heart to see him mash, 
He talked to every wench; 
He said his father was a 
tailor, 
And his mother was French; 
He died last week his mustache, 
And then went and sold his halt ; 
To take a 
colored gal named Snow, 
Down to the Irish fair. 
THE BARBER'S BRIDE, 
Written by PAUL ALLEN, and sung by LESTER. S: 
ALLEN in the 
various Variety Theatres in various parts'of the country. 
There was a 
young girl 
Name Lillie McNally, 
She danced in the first part 
And sang in the Bally; 
She fell in love with a 
barber 
And asked him to marry, 
He had corn beef on his mustache, 
And his name was Harry. 
He said she was too fresh, 
It made her feel sick; 
She shot him with a 
cannon, 
And stabbed him with a 
brick; 
He recovered, got her arrested, 
Then rode her on a-rail; 
He was fined fifteen years, 
Under twelve million bail. 
They were married in a 
graveyard, 
Ten minutes after dark; 
Now they are knitting stockings, 
For birds in the park; 
They are as happy as democrats, 
They don't live together; 
He got a 
divorce, 
'Cause she tickled him with a 
feather.

Funny Remarks of the Dying Boy. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
Comical Recitation by LEsTER S7 ALLEN, the Kings 4 .f Broaaway 
Mother give me an onion sandwich, 
Sell my appetite, for I 
can't eat; 
Hire a 
regiment of Italians, 
To shave the bunions off my feet ; 
Dye my hair the color of Ireland, 
Give my old clothes to some of the bums; 
it's a 
pity to die without a 
butcher, 
To cut the corns from off my gums. 
Tell my father he is a 
pauper, 
He is spittoon inspector of a 
Into bank; 
His clothes is pasted to his back from hushing, 
He vill die like me, a 
rank; 
Tell my friends they were no good. 
They tried to play me for a 
fool; 
am sorry I 
stabbed the sexton's d 
tiediter. 
For doing a 
song and dance in Sunday School. 
Put some pie and beef- stew in my coain, 
A bottle of ink and some clam-chowder; 
I'll look like a 
masher when I 
get to Heaven, 
I'll paint my cheeks with red or shot-gun powdet 
Mamma, don't the angels like candy? 
For when I 
reach that beautiful shore, 
I'll telegraph to you for a 
hundred dollars, 
And open an ice cream and candy store, 
MORAL. 
Little Joe skipped to another climate, 
lie tried to walk a 
tight rope on a 
spool of thread 
His parents now are in jail for being honest, 
Poor little joe has eat his last niece of bread.

LITTLE SOLOMAN JANGLES. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND, and sung by LESTER & ALLEN 
with great success. 
Air—Mary Kelly's Beau. 
o: 
Little porous plaster Jangles Esquire, 
Has bunions on his ear; 
His neck- tie is a 
pair of pants, 
He is inspector of state beer; 
He picks up buts to eat them, 
His breath would pull a 
car; 
He ain't changed his shirt in seven years, 
In his nose there is a 
banjo or guitar. 
CHORUS: 
Little Soloman Jangles, 
The worst of all the bums; 
Can bite cast-iron with his teeth, 
And walk upon his gums; 
He is the daisy lusher. 
He never will say no; 
He has signed two years' contract now, 
In Florida shoveling snow. 
His cheek is as hard as iron, 
He'll drink kerosene oil or blow out the lamp; 
He is got a 
barrel of medals, 
For being the champion tramp: 
He has been sentenced to be hung four times, 
For killing a 
German tailor; 
And every time he did escape, 
By getting stuck upon the jailer. 
WHAT I'D DO. 
Written by PAUL ALt..EN, and sung with great success by LESTER 
ALLEN, at TONY PASTOR'S THEATRE. New York. 
Candidates runniv for office tell, 
The voters they will prove true; 
Now if I 
was ruler of America, 
I'll tell you what I 
would do; 
I'd make Dr. Tanner President, 
To cut down expenses to one meal; 
And Grant would be the Treasurer, 
For you know he'd never steal. 
Put John Kelly for Vice-President, 
He'd make millionaires of the Tammany Ring; 
I'd put Blaine and Roscoe Conkling, 
Making shoes up in Sing Sing; 
I'd put Beecher in some female college, 
And let him practice what he'd preach; 
And Ben Butler inspecting the rotten navy, 
Or counting the breakers at Manhattan Beach.. 
I'd put Sammy Tilden in the Custom House, 
The robbers out he'd sweep; 
Garfield Superintendent of the Police, 
He'd hire Chinese to work cheap; 
I'd put Dennis Kearney cleaning the streets, 
Hancock and English would be in their joy; 
I'd make Garfield go back upon the Canal, 
And use Arthur for a 
telegraph boy.

Parody on Leaving the Old Folks. 
Written by BILLY LESTER, and sung by PAUL ALLEN, Esq. 
I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, to go I 
know not 
where, 
I 
am leaving it in sorrow and disgust; 
I've eight million in my pocket I 
stole from Viola 
Clifton, 
To try and get a 
date I 
know I 
must; 
I've a 
pocketful of gags and encores I 
bought from 
Sarah Bernhardt, 
I've been a 
tramp for over seven years; 
I 
could start a 
penny lodging house under the Fifth 
Avenue Hotel, 
And let people sleep in the drums of my ears. 
Cuollus: 
Then I 
am leaving now the Poor-House, I 
am trans-
ferred to the Coliseum, 
For trying to guy a 
couple of musical mokes; 
If I 
catch Niles & Evans stealing Eddie Booth's 
Dialect, 
I'll make them a 
present of John 'P. Kelly's jokes. 
Adam and Eve, From Lulu and Bud Granger were 
with a 
fly by night, 
They played to eighty cents in Kankakee; 
They done a 
nice big four act with the Arnold 
Brothers from Texas, 
And statue essence with the .1 
called Andy McKee 
Hyde & Behman done a 
waltz-jig along with Billy 
Emmet, 
Poor Paul Allen couldn't dance, his foot was sore; 
But yet he is a 
darling, be is mashed on Charlotte 
Banks, 
He is the pretty boy that came from Baltimore.

Hours of Pleasure. 
Published by permission of GEO. M OLINEUX, Brooldys„ 
'Twas at a 
ball I 
first met my girl, 
The fairest in the land; 
She had pearly teeth and a 
dimpled chin, 
And a 
little slender hand. 
She skipped around in mazy waltz 
As graceful as a 
fawn ; 
When the dance was o'er I 
asked Irene 
To walk out on the lawn. 
CHORUS. 
We sat by the brook and the stars shone bright, 
And we whispered words of love on that summer night. 
So we walked and talked till it grew quite late, 
But I 
know she has my heart; 
Then I'll bless the day when we get wed, 
And from her I'll never part. 
Next eve we met, near a 
running stream, 
And I 
walked close by her side; 
I 
told her then how I 
loved her so, 
And she said she'd be my bride. 
How happy I'll be all the while 
When Irene is my wife. 
We will have a 
cot by a 
babbling brook, 
And we'll settle down for life. 
We sat by the brook, & c. 
HORSESHOES.

Written by Jerry Cohan expressly for Billy Carter, and 
sung by him with great success. 
Copyrighted by A. J. Fisher, 1880. 
Since horseshoes are in fashion why a 
horseshoe song I'll 
sing, 
Its the latest superstition, the most fashionable thing, 
But the only ones '
cept horses who wear them as a 
rule, 
To do them any good must be the jackass or the mule. 
The ladies wear the horseshoe on their fingers,ears and hair, 
The men wear horseshoe pins and canes, it's horseshoe 
everywhere, 
They hang them on the masts at sea to keep away the gales, 
There's horseshoe clocks and bootjacks, horseshoe tracks 
and horseshoe nails. 
They put a 
horseshoe at the gate to keep the witches out, 
Thin people carry a 
horseshoe for luck to make 'em stout, 
And fat folks keep the horseshoe for luck to make them thin 
Yet the bummer sells the horseshoe to the junkman to get 
gin, 
The gambler carries the horseshoe his victim for to skin, 
And the victim carries a 
horseshoe to take the gambler in, 
The fisherman carries a 
horseshoe to help him make a 
haul, 
And if he catches only horseshoe fish he has no luck at all. 
They bake the bread in horseshoe pans, and mould the 
butter, too. 
They nail the horseshoe in the trunk to make the old 
clothes new, 
They hang 'em on the church door and for good luck to 
'em pray, 
And the preacher carries a 
horseshoe to keep the girls away 
The temperance mail he carries it to protect him from the 
rum, 
And in hopes he may keep always drunk it's treasured by 
the bum, 
If you want to see a 
horseshoe fly just tickle a 
mule and 
get struck. 
I've sung myself quite horse shoe see, so I'll wish ) ou all 
good luck.

A 
blazing star of solid style; 
From Coney Isle to Zululand, 
From sweet Cohohohoes to Newfoundland, 
Roam where you will a 
man you'll never find 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
CHORUS. 
For he's a 
man, understan, wid a 
very fine eye for a 
nice 
young girl, 
And a 
primo judge of Dublin wine, 
And creamy cream of the style, do you mind, 
Wid a 
rose like his nose, 
Of a 
color as bright as the red blue say, 
Oh, it's on the street, there's few you'll meet 
Like Levi Kassiday. 
A.-down the street with stately tread, 
And style that dislocates them all, 
NIeanders he, enveloped in 
A brand new fresh spring suit of gaul; 
Upon his arm hangs Julia Ann, 
Sweet lady bird of this daisy man, 
A. Don Juhannes in his mind is he, 
This Levi Kassiday. 
(Chorus.) 
When voices sweet were handed round, 
Levi was not behind the door, 
An over strung bass voice has he, 
He sang the " mast" in " Pinafore" 
From Asiah to Kalamazu, 
From Canada w 
to San Franciscu, 
Another one of it you'll seldom meet 
Like Levi Kassdav ( 
Chorus.)

Sweet Maggie Gordon you are my bride. 
Come sit you down upon my knee,

Why I

Neither have I

But I 
will hire some jolly sportsman, 
To carry o'er my love and I.

They are only jealous, 
And to that you agree, 
So if you like the fashion,

DANCE ME ON YOUR KNEE 
Sung with great success by Miss Minnie Leg 
When I 
was very young how fond I 
was of childish joys; 
I 
loved to play among the girls, but better with the boys; 
It was pussy in the corner, tag and ineminie, 
And when my ma put me in bed I 
would steel out on the 
sly. 
I 
dared not make the slightest noise when getting back in. 
bed, 
The biggest boy would boost me in my window overhead; 
I 
would go to sleep and dream I 
was a 
lady young and 
gay, 
And when my ma would take me up to her I 
used to say: 
CHORUS— 
Dance me on your knee, mother, dance me on your knee; 
Clasp your arms around my *aist, it wont hurt me. 
Hold me tight, don't let me fall, I 
won't be afraid at all, 
Dance me, mother, dance me on your knee. 
DANCE ME 
ON YOUR KNEE.—Concluded. 
Tut when I 
wore long dresses first the little boys I 
shook, 
As my ideas developed the bigger ones I 
took. 
Instead of childish games it was parties, social balls and 
drives, 
Where'er I 
went I 
had my favorite escort by my side. 
But when I 
tire of one young man, another soon I 
take, 
For there's a 
way of knowing how to give the boys a 
quiet 
shake. 
And when I 
wish to call one back a 
smile would win the 
day— 
I 
need but look upon his face and coaxingly this say: 
Dance me on your knee, &c. 
I 
want to find a 
lover that will undertake the task, 
And understand just what I 
want, and never have to ask. 
If such can recommend himself I 
pray don't backward be, 
But be sure you're brave and strong enough to dance me 
on your knee. 
There's many a 
wish a 
young girl has she don't like to 
express, 
There's many a 
time we answer no, and heartily mean 
yes. 
I 
always warn the fellows when we are sitting all alone, 
Be sure don't rumple up my clothes, when you dance me 
on your knee. 
Dance me on your knee, & c.

I'm over head and heels in love, 
With a

Who swears by all the stars above,

And oft at night when stars shine bright, 
And the silver moon in beauty shines above. 
We meet and walk, with happy talk, 
In all the pretty innocence of love.

She's my little ruby (

Then come with me at sunset to the valley, 
For there at twilight is our trysting tree, 
And there I 
meet the girl I 
hope to marry; 
I'm sure that you folks must envy me. 
Of course she's lots of followers, 
That seek her young affections to engage, 
She knows their hearts are hallower 
Than mine, although she's all the rage. 
Her pretty feet are small and neat, 
And then her waltzing is really quite divine. 
Her eyes shine bright like stars at night, 
Quite melt me with their brilliant dreamy shine.

By G. L. STOUT. 
EVA sleeps 'neath the willow, our darling's at rest; 
They folded her tiny hands above her breast, 
And from her white forehead, so marble and cold, 
Then tenderly parted her ringlets of gold. 
Where lingers the shadows at close of the day, 
'Neath the sods of the valley they laid her away. 
Eva, dear Eva, our treasure, our love, 
Singing hosannah with angels above. 
Cuoitus. 
Under the violets forever she sleeps, 
Where the pale moon and stars nightly over her weep. 
Eva, dear Eva, our treasure, our love, 
Singing hosannah with angels above. 
We bow to thy mercy, thou giver of all, 
Who tenderly watches the small sparrows fall. 
But 'tis hard that the angel thou give us in trust, 
In our warm love should wither and crumble to dust. 
But in infinite mercy you gave us to see 
how pure and unspotless an angel could be.

Singing hosannah with angels above.

And practice makes them true ; 
But the one that I've invented, 
You'll find it good and new •,

Afloat on life's great stream, 
But he'll never run the engine 
Unless he has the steam.

Then keep the fires a

You'll find the wheel will turn, 
You'll seldom meet with accidents 
IC the motive power you learn. 
Upon life's steam gauge keep an eye, 
Don't fall asleep and dream, 
For you'll never run the engine 
Unless you keep up steam. 
Look at the home where rich sunshine 
:Nlakes every thing so bright, 
Then gaze upon that poor man's hut, 
Where all is dark at night.

'Tis hard to run life's engine far, 
If he hasn't got much steam.

Columbus many years ago, 
Did ask the Queen of Spain, 
To fit him out with men and ships, 
To sail the unknown main ; 
Some instinct told him there was land 
That never had been seen ; 
Now we run America, for 
Columbus gave us steam. 
Then keep the fires, &c. 
Then haughty England made a 
yoke, 
And brought it to this land, 
But soon found out ' twould never fit 
That brave and fearless band. 
For the engine was commanded 
By 'Washington and Greene, 
And we owe our independence to 
Their patriotic steam.

When I 
was r. boy, a 
mischievous elf, 
I'd a 
very bad habi' ol 'helping myself; 
My motile' put everything out of my way, 
And well I 
remember these words she would say:

You're inclined to be a 
little forward, 
Now don't be so rude.

went every day, of course, to my school. 
I 
romped with the girls, and would not let them be,

You may look, etc. 
When I

And although she loved me, she was rather too staid. 
I 
dared not embrace her, or ask for a 
kiss, 
If I 
did, the reply from my love would be this: 
You may look, etc 
When we were engaged, r 
laid, No one could blame, 
So her scruples in that way 1 
soon overcame.

now want a 
kiss, you will not hear her any 
You may look, etc.

With a 
hump-backed bunion on her nose, 
And brick bat colored hair.

love my life, 
And she was gay you bet, 
But a 
Dutchman used to play for her 
On a 
yellow clarionette. 
CHORUS. 
He said he loved her much, 
And spoke Italian Dutch, 
And every time I 
caught him there, 
You bet I 
made him dust, dust, dust. 
He played for her night and day, 
And murdered Old Dog Tray, 
And paralyzed the people for 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Clothilda was the maiden fair, 
And Fritz the Dutchman bold, 
lie told her of his bully home 
And of his wealth untold. 
He played for her one afternoon, 
And got up to K 
flat, 
He blowed the brains out of his head, 
And spoilt his Sunday cravat.

YELLOW CLARIONETTE. 
(Continued.) 
CHORUS. 
This caught the maiden dead, 
For it almost turned her head, 
He asked her if she'd go with him, 
They to the parson fled. 
He married her on sight, 
I 
found it out that night, 
I 
drank twelve quarts of oyster soup, 
And went to bed quite tight. 
When I 
came to on the next day, 
I 
thought my heart would break, 
I 
tried to starve myself to death, 
With a 
whortleberry cake. 
I 
grabbed an iron boot jack, 
And I 
tried to cut my throat, 
I 
went alone to a 
beer saloon 
For a 
wooden overcoat. 
CHORUS. 
I 
saw the gal last week, 
And she's got lots of cheek, 
She plays a 
K 
flat clarionette, 
With that hump-backed freckled beat. 
She says old man don't fret, 
I've got two boys you bet, 
And they are marked down 
To the middle of the nose 
With a

As originally sung by Goss and Fox, 
Polly dear, I've just come here, 
To ask yon to be mine, 
I 
love you true, you know I 
do, 
I 
hope I 
am in time, 
Oh won't you hush, you make me blush, 
You ought'nt tell so soon, 
You know I 
love ymt dearly, and 
F,a. you alone I'll bloom. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet Polly Blossom, won't you bloom for me, 
And make my heart as happy as a 
possom on a 
tree, 
Sweet Polly Blossom you've got me in your thrall, 
I 
never will be happy till I 
claim you stem and all. 
I 
He] 
Sound the fiddle beat de bones, 
And let the music ring, 
There's going to be a 
wedding soon, 
'Well marry in the spring. 
[She] I 
really think, my heart will sink, 
lot as happy as a 
coon, 
I'll never dirt with ooys again. 
Together we will bloom. 
Sweet Polly Blossom won't you bloom for me, 
And make my heart as happy as a 
possom on a 
tree, 
Sweet Polly Blossom, -you've got me in your thrall, 
I.

Sweet Laughing Eyes,

Air: " Pretty as a 
Picture." 
Oh, I 
feel so glad, I 
shall go mad, 
I 
pray you don't come near me, 
For I 
fell in love with such a 
dove, 
Of my heart she is the queen. 
As she sweetly smiled she set me wild, 
With love I 
shall go crazy; 
For I 
scarcely knew just what to do, 
Her smile was so serene, 
Like a 
little dove in clover, 
And before I 
knew it this darling she had won use ; 
She's the fairest, she's the rarest, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
CHORUS. 
With sweet laughing eyes, like the sunrise, 
She looked so fair, bewitching, 
And the world to inc now seems to be 
So full of laughing eyes. 
With this little pet I 
met 
In golden mild September, 
How my heart it beat, she looked so sweet, 
Oh, I 
never can forget; 
And so now you see, she's the world to me, 
Her loving smile enchains me, 
And her eyes of blue they pierce me through, 
I 
wish the time was set. 
She's a 
little dove in clover, 
But will her love be true? I 
often sit and wonder. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
starling, 
She's a 
little dove in clover over there. 
With sweet laughing eyes, 
Oh de Old Folks am Gone. 
OLD MAN PLANTATION CHARACTER SONG. 
Sung by Barlow, Wilson, Primrose and West's Minstrels. 
Far, far in many lands I've wander'd, 
Sadly and lone, 
My heart was ever turning southward, 
To all the dear ones at home ; 
Here ; after all my weary roaming, 
At early dawn, 
I've come and find the cot still standing, 
But, oh, the old folks are gone. 
CHORUS. 
Here I 
wander sad and lonely, 
In the dear old home, 
Those that I 
loved so well and fondly— 
All, all the o_d folks are gone. 
Here's where I 
frolic'd with my brother, 
Under the tree, 
here's were I 
knelt beside my mother, 
From care and sorrow free ; 
Still sing the little birds as sweetly, 
At night and morn, 
Still runs the little brook as fleetly, 
But 0, the old folks are gone. 
Here I 
wander sad and lonely, &.c 
Down where the old banana's waving, 
They're laid to rest, 
Where Swanee's peaceful water's laving 
The green turf o'er their breast ; 
But there's a 
home I 
know, where parting 
Never can come; 
Oh, for that home I 
must be startinc*, 
There's where the old folks are ;one.  
Here I 
wander fiad and lonely, & c. 
OLD RECOLLEC rioNs. 
FAR back in the sweet past my mem'ry's oft Nvandered. 
To the spot that I 
loved neath the old shady trees; 
Where oft with my books o'er quaint stories I've pondered, 
Or to dream- land was wafted by mid- summer's breeze. 
I 
recall with a 
sigh the bright days of my childhood, 
When ' neath the old trees with my comrades I 
strayed, 
And heard the birds singing sweet songs in the wild- wood, 
Or watched the bright brook as it flowed throug , the glade 
But, ah ! the bright days of my boyhood are fleeting, 
The faces of dear ones are passing away; 
It makes my heart sad when I 
think of our meeting 
'Neath the old shady trees, every bright summer day. 
Long years have gone by, and my comrades have left me, 
Their voices no longer are beard in the glade; 
But I 
see the old trees that I 
loved in my childhood, 
With their wide-spreading branches, and welcoming shade, 
As I 
pause by the brooklet, old menfry's steal o'er me, 
My heart it grows sad—the hot tears will not stay; 
For the many dear friends that I 
loved in my boy-hood, 
Are gone from my sight, and are passing away. 
Chorus.—But, oh!, dr.o.

SON G AND DANCE. 
Written and composed by Tom HARPER, the original ONE LEGGED 
SONG AND DANCE MAN. 
On the banks of the river Ohio, 
In a 
quiet flowing glade, 
Where the soft and gentle river flows 
In sunshine and in shade ; 
It was there I 
saw a 
maiden fair, 
Eyes jet and breast like snow, 
And in meeting her has caused me great despair— 
Down by the Ohio. 
Beneath the trees she lay reclining (Break.) 
Her two bright eyes like stars were shining (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
And as I 
gazed upon tier form, 
I 
lost my heart, you know ; 
I 
won't forget the girl I 
met 
Down by the Ohio. 
I 
took courage to kiss her little hand, 
When she started like a 
fawn, 
And blushed like the rose of early morn 
That spreads all o'er the dawn. 
I 
said and would she be mine, 
She slowly answered, " No," 
And left me standing all alone 
Down by the Ohio. 
And as I 
gazed, 8zc. 
Only the Way on the Stage. 
Composed by FRED. J. MACKLEY and sung by HENRY GRAHAM. 
If you will listen to me, some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage: 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quite old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed all smiles, 
Placed his hand in his pocket and drew forth his wages, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man, by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad 
To see that man punished for the crime he committed. 
The jury looked stern, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that.rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it was played on the stage. 
in the next scene I 
saw a 
clergyman _rom Brooklyn, 
Who was dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one from Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed ; 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine sermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that they practiced each sermon they preached, 
But it was only the way it wi,s ,ilayest on the stage.

PARODY ON PITCHER OF BE] ' 
As sung' by I 
TARRIGAS 4k. H ART in the Mulligan Guard's Pienk.. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND, 
I 
ant a friend to the Millionaire, when he is drunk, 
Though from a 
Millionaire I 
am far away; 
My Pa he is rich, he owns a 
wood's and a 
ditch, 
And gets seventy-five cents every day. 
Ire spends money free for coffee and tea, 
,\ ad often it does turn his brain; 
To see himself drinking water because he is poor, 
And the rich drink from their bottle of champagne 
CHORUS: 
Then each week in the night, each year in the month, 
It will snow, it will blow, or it will rain; 
'While the rich is draining beer-kegs on some lonely street, 
Willie the poor man is drinking champagne. 
The poor go to Long Branch for the good of their healt Ii 
The Herald and the Sun is the proof; 
They smoke ;','42.00 cigars, go in bathing in silks, 
While the rich have to sleep on the roof. 
Its a 
shame poor factory girls can't wear diamond ring:, 
If she catches a 
mash at a 
ball, he is insane; 
he'll buy her a 
doughnut and a 
three cent lemonade, 
And imagine she is drinking champagne.

Then take my advice, sleep on a 
cake of ice, 
if you're got a 
bad reputation, rub out the stain; 
The Queen of Cincinnati has to drink milk,

Bummer Flowers. 
Sung with immense success at Harry Miner's by En. FAVOR, of I
, Avori 
and SHIELDS. 
See how fast from Heaven, mother, 
Falls the feathery flakes of snow, 
Weaving white and pure a 
mantle 
For the fruitful earth below. 
Ere they melt I 
leave you, mother, 
Leave for ever this world of pain ; 
For something tells me I 
shall never 
SF 
summer flowers again. 
CHORUS. 
Do not weep, dear loving mother, 
Sad am I 
to cause you pain ; 
But something tells me I 
shall never 
See the summer flowers again. 
How I 
loved alone to wander, 
In the happy days long flown, 
O'er fields and meadows fair to gather 
Bright-hued blossoms freshly blown. 
Soon beyond the rippling river, 
Winding onwards o'er the plain, 
The buds may burst, but I 
shall never 
father them for you again.

'Twas an evening in midsummer, 
When the stars did gently peep, 
Reclining in the meadow, 
I 
tried to doze asleep ; 
When a 
vision of surpassing beauty, 
Then passed me by too soon, 
With form so slight and step so light, 
Where the little roses bloom. 
CHORUS. 
IIer name she would not tell me, 
'Twas love then that befell me, 
For the sweetest girl I 
knew ; 
Arm in arm we wandered gaily, 
liy the light of the silvery moon ; 
She said I'll meet you love again ; 
Where the little roses bloom.

When the Flowers have gone to Roost. 
By CHARLES It. DOCKSTADER, and sung by " The 2 
ITALEys." 
Where the Watermelons grow, 
The wind in the key of Z 
doth blow; 
Where the gurgling riplets ramble, 
O'er the mossy, jack-stones; 
Meet me with thy glossy smile, 
Blushes fan thy granite brow; 
Sylph-like glide thy cowhide foot steps. 
Goodness, hello my Annie. 
Citonus: 
When the flowers walk in their sleep, 
And the night-mare trots the deep; 
Race back home and help us eat, 
Boston Baked Beans, my Annie. 
When thy young heart, pure and free, 
Beats dead, beats alone for me; 
Music, Mickey, INlikey, oh! 
Thin be jabez, Annie; 
Och, du hist verrikkt mein kinct, 
Pigeon-toed are thy footsteps; 
hear the hydrant how it gurgles, 
By the Tan Yard, Annie. 
Cuonts: 
When the flowers walk in their sleep, 
And the willows sob and weep; 
Gently heifers softly creep, 
Oh be gosh, my Annie.

Where was Solomon Isaacs when the 
Loafers Stole the Geese. 
I'm a 
quiet Hebrew man, 
My business I 
know well, 
And if you wait a 
little while 
My troubles I 
will tell. 
It's about a 
gang that hangs around, 
And me they always teaze ; 
And if I 
only turn my head 
.From the cellar they steal my geese. 
CHORUS. 
Where was Soiomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
What was he about when they cracked him in the snout ? 
Where was Solomon Isaacs when the loafers stole the geese ? 
They kicked me all around the place, 
Until my head was sore; 
They wasn't satisfied with that, 
They want to give me more. 
My wife went almost crazy then 
From hollering out " Police! 
There goes a 
gang of robbers there, 
They stole my husband's geese !" 
Where was Solomon Isaacs, 
To the court next day I 
went, 
My wife Rachel and I. 
The judge says " What's your business here, 
What makes that woman cry ?” 
I 
said, Oh, judge, good Mr. Judge, 
just listen if you please: 
A gang of giraffes hangs round my store, 
And they always steel my geese."

When the purple lilacs blossom, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will the robin and the bluebird 
Greet us with a

Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet.

In the soft and gentle twilight, 
Where we often, love, have met, 
You will tell me, little darling, 
If you dearly love me yet. 
When the daisies dot the meadow, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will di@ summer zephyr kiss us 
When we wander down the lane ? 
Long ago we met and parted 
In the golden pastures bright, 
And since then, my little darling. 
Time has quickly taken flight. 
In the soft, &c. 
When in Heaven with the angels, 
Shall we, dearest, meet again ? 
Will we climb the hill together 
To the land that knows no pain ? 
In that home no wail of sorrow 
Breaks the pure and loving heart, 
And I 
hope, my little darling, 
There we'll meet to never part.

Thinking of Home. 
Written and sung by M YLES M ORRIS, in his great Nautical Specialty. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1880. 
Many a 
night on the silent deck, 
have I 
gazed on the stars above, 
And I've looked abroad on the tranquil sea, 
fill my heart was filled with love, 
Thinking of home and the dear ones there, 
Till I 
felt the tear drops flow, 
Breathing in silence a 
fervent prayer, 
For the friends of long ago. 
CHORUS. 
Many a 
night, yes many a 
night, thinking of home ; 
Many a 
night, yes many a 
night, thinking of home. 
Father and mother and sister dear, 
Come to me in my waking dreams, 
And I 
hear a 
voice and I 
see a 
face, 
Which to me like an angel seems. 
Ah, did I 
not give her my parting vow, 
And the broken ring to keep ? 
Spirit of beauty, hear me now, 
As I 
sigh upon the deep. 
Many a 
night, &c. 
But proudly the flag of Columbia waves 
Wherever the salt seas flow, 
To the frozen deep or burning clime 
Her sons will gladly go, 
Doing and daring in her dear name 
All that man can do or dare, 
Thinking of home I 
have longed for fame 
For the sake of the kind hearts there. 
Many a 
night, & e.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ztlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momen 
tone 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. As 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolongeciand enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age. 
HII11PTY D 
14 PTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
Ft is a Eac simile of a Trick practiced by alt 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written, that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HUMPTY DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
succession of 
figures. 
One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in. his tesselated suit ; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
