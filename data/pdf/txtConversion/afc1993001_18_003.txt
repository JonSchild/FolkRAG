INTRODUCTIo:i
 
The Ethnic Heritage and Language School Project guide-
lines called for each fieldworker to study one eti r
nic
 
school in depth,  rather than do a survey of several schools.
 
However,  I discovered that a system of fourteen Polish
 
Saturday schools is currently operating in the Chicago area
 
under the "umbrella" program of the Polish Teachers Association
 
in America,  Inc., which directs the educational component
 
of the schools.
 The Polish Teachers Association in America
 
(hereafter PT
)  program includes several different types
 
of classes,  not all of which are offered at any one school.
 
I originally chose the main school of my study, Gen. Casimir
 
Pulaski School, thinking that it did offer all aspects;
 
but I later added a visit to Father Kolbe School to observe
 
kindergarten classes and classes for non-Polish 5peak1r
 
children.
 
Thus this report is an introduction not only to one
 
Polish school, but to a coordinated system of schools.
 
The report will discuss the program of the PTAA in general,
 
its history, goals,  and operation,  as well as how two of
 
the schools carry out this program.
 
The PTAA was extremely cooperative.
 I had extensive
 
interviews with two PTAA administrators.
 Wiktor Barczyk,
 
Chairman of the PTAA Education Committee,  gave me initial
 
background on the entire subject,  and accompanied me on all
 
school visits,  as well as giving generously of his time to
 
1
 
answer additional questions.
 Helena Ziolkowska, PT2
 
President and Kolbe School Principal, also gave generously
 
of her time in interviews,  helping with translation,  and
 
answering questions.
 
In addition,  I visited the PTAA office,  two of the
 
schools, observed the schools' participation in Polish
 
Constitution Day Parade,  attended the graduation banquet
 
for Pulaski School's seniors, and visited the Polish Schools
 
Day picnic.
 I conducted several other interviews by phone.
 
During visits to Pulaski and Kolbe Schools, principals,
 
teachers,  and parents gave us a warm welcome.
 The PTAA
 
has also donated a selection of their textbooks to the
 
Ethnic Schools Project.
 
I would also like to mention the invaluable help of
 
my husband, George Medakovich, who contributed three Satur-
days to the Project.
 He carried all the heavy
 
reel-to-reel equipment and handled all on-site classroom
 
recording.
 
Although the time allotted for the project was short,
 
a great deal of information was gathered.
 There was just
 
not enough time to digest it all, and I would suggest on
 
future projects allowing equal time for research and for
 
consideration and writing.

EEFORL THE POLISH TEACHERS ASSOCIATION:
 
AN HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION TO POLISH EDUCATION IN CHICAGO
 
Po l
ish immigration to Chicago began in the 1350's,  and
 
with Polish people came the desire to establish Polish
 
churches.
 Nost Poles are Catholic,  and historically being
 
Polish and being Catholic were most often synonymous.
 I am
 
not conversant with the immense literature on the Catholic
 
Church in America or on Polish-American Catholicism.
 However,
 
-1%

.S
 
it seems important to note that the Catholic Church vat  the
 
time of original Polis
mmigration and for many years afto
 
was dominated by Irish and German clerics.
 The Catholi
 
hierarchy often did not have much sympathy for the estabil, .
 
ment of ethnic parishes,  in particular Polish parishes.
 
Thus, •a significant part of the history of the development
 
of Polish communities in the
 
within the Catholic Church.
 
recent book Polish Catholics
 
United States is that of conflict
 
Indeed, Joseph Parot,  in his
 
in Chicago:
 1850-1920, seems to
 
feel that there was a similar split a m o n g  Polish Catholics
 
themselves:
 on the one hand, those who felt that religion,
 
i.e.  Catholicism, came first and Polishness second;  and those
 
who wanted national parishes, and felt that Polishness in a
 
sense came before religion--or at least that the two were inex-
tricably intertwined.
 
These trends eventually resulted in the establishment of
 
different types of Polish Catholic parishes in Chicago.
 
Polish parishes were run by Polish Roman Catholic religious
 
orders, most notably the Resurrectionist congregation,
 
2
 
and Polish Archdiocesan parishes, directly subordinate to
 
the Archdiocese.
 Poles also attended mixed ethnic parishes,
 
where English was the main language of the parish.  Yet
 
another result of the conflicts among Polish Catholics
 
was the establishment of the Polish National Catholic Church,
 
which separated completely from the Roman Catholic Church
 
in the early 1900's, creating the American Catholic Church's
 
only schism.
 I have not been able to ascertain what the
 
Polish National Catholic Church's efforts in terms of educ-
ation and Polish language and heritage education in particular
 
have been.
 It would certainly be interesting to compare
 
the different types of parishes and their schools over the years.
 
As Polish parishes were created, schools were established
 
in conjunction with the parish churches.
 So many appeared
 
all over the country that in 1948, Rev. Francis Bolek described
 
them as a Polish American School System. These schools were
 
staffed by teaching sisters, •fathers and brothers of various
 
religious orders.
 Rev. Bolek gathered figures for the entire
 
United States, finding that in 1930 over 300,000 children of
 
Polish descent were studying Polish language and culture in
 
their parish schools.
 However, in 1948 this figure had de-
creased to 200,000 nationwide, and by the end of the 1950's,
 
in Chicago at least, may have ceased altogether  (
personal
 
communication from Edwin Cudecki, Chicago Polish-American
 
educator).
 
According: to Bole':, the Polish American School "system"
 
was at its peak in 1930, when two-thirds of the Polish parishes
 
in the United States supported parish schools.
 There were
 
560 schools nationwide.
 
These parish schools were facilitated greatly by t
iie
 
Polish teaching orders of nuns, notably the Felician Sisters,
 
and by the educational activities of the Resurrectionist
 
Fathers.
 In Chicago at the end of the nineteenth century,
 
there were 11,500 students enrolled in Polish parochial schools;
 
St. Stanislaus Kostka parish school had 4,000 students.
 
(
7. Krolokowski, 1981).
 Krolokowski very briefly describes
 
these schools in the earliest years as being primarily prep-
aration for literacy and religious training, though after
 
1900 the curriculum became more stabilized and thorough.
 
The 1930's, however, as recounted both in written sources
 
and personally by graduates of Chicago-area Polish parish
 
schools, seems to have been the watershed for these schools.
 
There never really was a "system" in the sense of unified
 
teaching methods, curriculum and texts.  Each school stood on
 
the organizational ability of its staff.
 The religious orders
 
supplied new teachers.
 But since no organized system existed,
 
each school apparently succont
hed one by one to larger pressures.
 
Several reasons for the decline of Polish parish schools
 
have been advanced.
 The Depression may have hit them hard,
 
as parents were forced to remove their children from parochial
 
schools and send them to the free public schools.
 Bolek con-
tends that subsequently children would not return to the
 
L
L
 
parish schools, preferring the "atmosphere" of the public
 
schools.
 Bolek also feels that resett1 itn of Polish families
 
in neighborhoods which were not primarily Polish also contrib-
uted to this trend.
 
During the 1930's two other pressures on the Polish
 
parish schools may have contributed greatly to the decline
 
of the schools.
 Apparently the Catholic Archdiocese, which
 
had to some extent encouraged or tolerated ethnic parishes,
 
began to put more pressure on local churches to rid themselves
 
of "foreign" asosciations,  stressing the common factor of
 
Catholicism over ethnicity.
 There was also pressure in general
 
on immigrants to join the American "melting pot."
 
I spoke with two Chicago-area Polish-American educators,
 
both about fifty, both second-generation, who were educated
 
in the Polish parochial schools in the 1930's and  '
40's.
 
Frances Drwal is a native of Posen, a suburb on Chicago's
 
southwest side, which was founded by Polish immigrants an ,
 
named for the town of Poznan in Poland.
 Ms. Drwal attended
 
schools run by Felician Sisters in Posen.
 She heard but did
 
not learn fluent Polish at home  and at school,  but she does
 
not remember studying in Polish at school.
 
'
Is. Drwal later became a teacher of Russian and English
 
reading specialist, teaching in the public schools.
 She also
 
became fluent in contemporary Polish language through studying
 
in Poland and has taught Polish.
 
A contrasting view of Polish parochial education at about
 
the same time was offered by Edwin Cudecki, now Director of
 
Foreign Language Instruction for the Chicago Board of Education.
 
5
 
i
e grew up speaking Polish at home,  in the main Polish neigh-
borhood in Chicago on the near Northwest Side of the city,
 
near Hilwaukee and Division Streets.
 He was sent to a
 
Polish parochial school run by Resurrectionist Fathers in
 
his parents'  parish, about eight blocks from his home.
 This
 
in spite of the fact that one block away was a Polish Roman
 
Catholic parish  (not run by a Polish order),
 
away an "English", or mixed-ethnic parish.
 
-'
f
r.
 
and two blocks
 
Cudecki recalls a seemingly arbitrary use of Polish
 
language in school.
 Older sisters seemed to teach the
 
youngest children, and they spoke mostly Polish.
 As children
 
got older,  they were taught by younger nuns who might use
 
Polish or English.
 Specifically he recalled the Baltimore
 
Catechism being taught in both English and Polish, Bible
 
study taught only in Polish, and other subjects in English,
 
or at the whim of the individual teacher and her language
 
preference.
 He also attended a high school run by Resur ec-
tionist Fathers, graduating in 1949.
 
Mr. Cudecki has relatives who attended Polish parish schools
 
through the end of the 1950's; Polish and English were both
 
used in their schools too.
 However, he himself does not recall
 
any specific Polish language instruction;  it was simply assumed
 
that all students were bilingual.
 And Polish seems to have
 
disappeared from all the parish schools after the 1950's.
 
What kind of Polish language was being used in the parish
 
6
 
schools?
 Pirst of all,  the Polish language spoken by the
 
2ar1y i
m m i g r a n t s  was not uniform.
 In the laQO's Poland did
 
not exist as an independent nation;  it was divided in the
 
late 1700's among Russia,  Prussia and Austria.
 Many Polish
 
speakers from these countries did not identify themselves as
 
'
Polish" but as "Russian Poles" or "Austrian Poles."
 The
 
olish immigrants in Chicago spoke a variety of rural dialects,
 
since most were peasants.
 Regional grammatical constructions
 
and archaic word usages persisted through several generations
 
of American-born children,  creating a language sometimes referred
 
to as "Chicago Polish."
 The American-born nuns and priests
 
teaching in the parish schools knew this "American" Polish.
 
A Polish Saturday school teacher commented that the
 
only American-born parish priests who speak Polish are now in
 
their 60's,  and were probably educated in the Polish parochial
 
schools of the  '30's.
 They speak mostly "Chicago Polish",
 
which is sufficient for their service to the parishes.
 
However, when a new generation of immigrants from Poland
 
started arriving after World War II,  speaking contemporary
 
Polish and often a literary version at that,  language became
 
a point of conflict within the Polish community.
 This great
 
influx of Polish refugees, coming in the late 1940's and  '50's,
 
arrived at a time when the Polish parish schools were in decline.
 
But instead of rejuvenating the Polish aspect of the Polish
 
parochial schools, these new immigrants sent their children both
 
to parochial schools for their regular education,  and
 
7
 
started new Polish Saturday schools where their children learned
 
Polish language, customs and traditions.
 
Why did the existing schools not meet their needs for
 
f
lP o li sh
!  education?
 
born teachers in the
 
contemporary Polish.
 
Language was one barrier.
 The American-
Polish parochial schools did not speak
 
one post-war immigrant said that the
 
American Polish grammar and archaic words make her "wince. 1'
 
The new immigrants thus did not feel that the nuns could
 
give their children an adequate education in Polish language.
 
Polish customs and traditions, too, as taught in the parochial
 
schools were Polish-American traditions, which had evolved
 
over the one hundred years of Polish settlement in the U.S.
 
These too were often strange or archaic to the newly-arrived
 
Poles.
 
Another important reason for the new Saturday schools
 
was the fact that these were political, not economic, immigrants.
 
The parents felt a strong bond of patriotism to their homeland,
 
and wanted their children to feel that bond as well.
 They
 
needed to have schools where their children could learn contemp-
orary Polish language and history, taught by the trained
 
professional teachers among the new arrivals.
 
The difference in attitude toward Polish language which
 
was evidenced by its treatment in the parish schools and the
 
new immigrants' schools carries over in many aspects of inter-
action between the different segments of the Polish community
 
today.
 In the parochial schools, Polish was used but not
 
8
 
actively taught.
 In the new schools, study of Polish language,
 
including advanced reading and writing skills, is a major
 
emphasis.
 
This ,--
is only one way in which old and new immigrants'
 
perceptions of what it means to he Polish and how that should
 
be expressed conflict.
 Over the years this conflict has been
 
a continuing theme, which has now acquired yet another dimension
 
with a still more recent influx of new economic immigrants
 
from Poland since the lat 1960 1s, ,
who hold yet another viewpoint.
 
The theme of generational conflict will be discussed below
 
in connection with several different aspects of the Polish
 
Saturday schools.

HISTORY OF THE POLISH TEACHERS ASSOCIATION IN A
iIERICA,  INC./
 
ZRZESZENIE NAUCZYCIELI POLSKICN N ANIFYCE
 
Poland was invaded in 1939 by the Soviet Union at the
 
beginning of Norld War II.
 The founders of the Polish
 
Teachers Association in America,  and a great many teachers
 
and parents who are currently active in the PTA
.41 schools
 
were adults or young children in Poland at that time,
 
and lived through the war, often losing family, home, and
 
finally country.
 
After World W r II,  a great many Polish people found
 
themselves in two main geographic locations outside Poland:
 
displaced persons  (refugee)  camps in Germany,  and temporary
 
camps for housing personnel associated with the Polish Army
 
in England.
 During the war,,
-the Polish Government
. in Exile
 
established itself in England, and the Polish Army associated
 
itself with the British Army and fought with them.
 After
 
the war, the Polish Army was demobilized in England from
 
soveral fronts,  including Italy and Africa.
 
In both Germany and England,  schools were set up by
 
Polish teachers.
 In Germany, the schools were set up so
 
that children could continue their regular Polish education,
 
based on the premise that they would someday be returning
 
home.
 In England, ,
a sort of bilingual school system was
 
developed,  so that students could not only study their
 
regular Polish subjects, but also prepare,  in English,
 
to pass the British school exams.
 The schools hoped to
 
give students the choice of matriculatin
- in either the
 
10
 
British or Polish universities.
 Polish 1anguace, culture
 
and history were taught in Polish;  all other subjects were
 
taught in English.
 
Wiktor Barczyk, chairman of the ?T
 Education Committee,
 
was in the Polish Army during the war.
 He had a degree in
 
languages from the University o  Vienna, and taught
- nimse1
 
English in the army.
 After the war he took advantage of the
 
British offer for Polish soldiers to attned school, and
 
took a teaching credential at the University of London.
 
He was then asked to work for the Polish Ministry of Educa-
tion in London, and had experience in these Polish-British
 
schools as an administrator and classroom teacher.
 There
 
were even boarding schools set up for Polish students,
 
segregated by sex, modeled on the British schools.
 
Many Poles made their way to the United  States after
 
World War II after the Displaced Persons Commission o
 
the U.S. Congress opened the way in 1943.
 Thousands settled
 
in Chicago during the late 1940's and 1950's.
 
In this new wave of immigration, the first since the
 
great period of immigration from Poland in the late nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries, there were many teachers
 
and professionals, •as well as families with children.
 They
 
found in Chicago existing Polish churches, and social and
 
fraternal organizations, but developed new ones to meet their
 
needs.
 Six new Polish organizations were formed in the late
 
1940's in Chicago.
 
however,  the new immigrants
 elt a need for schools
 
which would continue the Polish aspect of education for their
 
children--polish language and traditions.
 This need, as
 
discussed above, could not be met by the existina Polish
 
parish schools.
 
.
ucational activities of various sorts
 
began quickly.
 
The exact history of this early period is not clear;
 
e  ew existing accounts conclict.
 However,  it  seems
 
that teachers first gravitated to each other on a social
 
oasis,  aeeting sor Pol ish  ol days and private parties.
 
An early activity was lectures for young people as well
 
acults on current events and other topics of general interest.
 
Around 1951, the "Circle of Polish Teachers and Gradu-
ates Abroad"  (also translated as "Polish Teachers and
 
School Alumnae Circle in Exile" )
 /
lKolo  ychowawcow i
 
tychowankow Polskich Szkol na Uciiodzctvri & was formed.
 The
 
Circle formed a Pedagogical Section which began teaching
 
classes in ?Oi
h language and history about 1952.
 These
 
classes eventually evolved into General Pulaski School.
 
Thirty-two pupils originally met for these classes in the
 
building of the Alliance of Polish women; other Polish org-
anizations also donated space.
 The Circle gave financial
 
help to the classes.
 The Pedagogical Section also sponsored
 
lectures.
 In 1956,
a Parent-Teacher Organization was formed.
 
Various educational organizations seem to have disin-
tegrated and reformed during the late 1950's.
 In 1961,
 
the "Polish Teachers Association in the United States of
 
North America" was established, with  7
1odimierz Nerchun as
 
12
 
as its first president.
 In 1962, this group unit c1  7
ith the
 
"Circle of Polish Teachers and Graduates of Polish Schools

is last consolidation, a stable working organ -
zation seems to have finally emerged,  although
 
the PTAA
 
formally counts its beginnings from 1953  (they celebrated
 
their Silver Jubilee or twenty-fifth anniversary,  in 1973).
 
Tne new organ 4.zac on immediately set to wor  on a nui: :T
 
tasks, which were given to various working commlttee:.
 
The r tasks included work on textbooks, publications,
 
verifying teaching credentials of newly-arrived teachers,
 
starting new schools, and sponsoring lectures.
 
THE NO K OF THE POLISH TEACHERS ASSOC AT1ON IN

E ICA
 
Polish Teachers Association membership is open to all
 
teachers and administrators in the Polish Saturday schools.
 
Two representatives from each school, the Parent-Teachers
 
Association President and the Head Teacher, make up the
 
PTAA Board, which meets regularly.
 Membership fees are
 
$3.00 pcy year, which does not begin to cover organizational
 
costs.
 
In or der  to zur :r

and ncly sup:crz its aj2j --
iated schools, the PTAA raises money.
 The main fund-raising
 
event of the year is  the Day of Polish Schools picnic, held
 
in late June.
 All the Polish schools are invited, and a
 
$3.00 donation is asked for admission.
 There is a mass,
 
a program by students,  food available all day,  and a band
 
for dancing.
 The picnic is held in a nice grove owned
 
by the Polish National Catholic Church,  situated next to
 
O'Hare Airport.
 The picnic is also a traditional time for
 
individuals and organizations to give donations--sometimes
 
quite substantial--to the PTAA.
 For example,  the Polish
 
National Alliance annually contributes one dollar per child
 
to each school;  and the Alliance of Young Polish U
iomen gives
 
about $2000 each year to the PT A.
 
The PTAA maintains an office in the Polish Veterans
 
Building at 6005 W.  Irving Park Rd. on Chicago's Northwest
 
side.
 This office is used for meetings and houses the PT
 
library.
 
14
 
The PTAA library contains about 2000 volumes for
 
ueacners' use.
 The books are primarily in Polish and include
 
Polish literature, history and other Polish subjects, as well
 
as child psychology and educational methodology.  The lib-
rary also has a few subscr iptions to journals dealing wit
 
Polish-American topics  (
for example, Polish- nerican Studies).
 
A smaller library of books which students may boroow is also
 
maintained.
 A small store of equipment and teaching aides,
 
slide and film projectors, posters, slide/tape presentations,
 
and so forth are available for loan to the schools.
 
The PT
's activities cover a wide range of services
 
to the Polish Saturday schools, and include the following:
 
1
.
 offering assistance in starting new Saturday schools;
 
2.
 Propagating the Polish language, including producing
 
a pamphlet on "Why and How to Organize Polish Schools"
 
(
out of print);
 
3
.
 Organizing special contests-
for young people who are
 
studying Polish language, and open to Saturday schools
 
public, and parochial schools.
 During the 1960's two
 
essay contests were held.
 One commemorated  the Poli
 
millenium in 1966, the other Copernicus' anniversary.
 
Currently the main contest sponsored is the poetry
 
recitation contest, which has been held -sporadically
 
over the last ten years, most recently in 1980 and 1982.
 
These are quite ambitious events which require a number
 
of volunteers to raise money (about $3500)  to sponsor
 
the event, and serve as organizers and judges.
 The
 
contests have been vary well received,  and students have
 
enthusiastically participated.

The Polish-1 merican Educators is a group of teachers
 
who are of Polish descent,  but may or may not teach
 
Polish language or subjects.
 The PTAA attends their
 
meetings, but some administrators feel unat their goals
 
are not really very similar.
 
5.
 The PTAA also cooperates rather extensively with similar
 
teachers' organizations in Canada and England.
 
The
 
Polish Government in Exile still exists in England,  and
 
Polish schools have continued to be active there since
 
World War II.
 Each year the PTAA exchanges reports with
 
these organizations,  and all have developed curriculum
 
materials which they exchange.
 Included in the curriculum
 
materials contributed to the Library of Congress through
 
this project are texts developed in Canada and England.

Polish Teachers Association in America Schools
  
There are currently fourteen Polish Saturday schools
 
in the Polish Teachers Association network.
 Some are older,
 
estai l s1 ed schools, other are very new.
 Pulask  and
 
±OSC1USJ 0  sC f
lOOiS  in Chicago are both about thirty years
 
old, while
 
five o  the
 ourteen have opened witA n the 
as
 
years.
 
Two other schools have opened
 
with PTZ
 consul-
tation in  I
innesota and Houston,  Texas.
 
In 1980, total enrollment  n the PTAA scnools was around
 
2000 students.
 In 1981-32 it had increased to 3000.
 This
 
growth in interest is attributed by PTAA administrators to
 
two main
 actors:
 the election o  the Polisu Pope; and
 
the new visib ility of the Solidarity effort in Poland and
 
the worldwide public support and sympathy which has resulted.
 
The adm inistrators felt that these positive
 actors
 
helped to counteract negative stereotypes of Po
sunesG,
 
especially as embod ied in the "Polish joke" and the ima;s o
 
the "dumb Polack."
 In contrast, a young graduate of Pulaski
 
who was interviewed felt that the Polish Pope was not an
 
important factor; more important,  she thought, might be the
 
solidarity movement.
 
It would be interesting to find out who the new students
 
are and why they actually enrolled.
 It could conceivably
 
be related to other factors,  such as increased immigration
 
of young parents from Poland.
 Also, have American-born
 
and new Polish immigrant families both become more interested
 
in Polish school in the last two years, and why?
 
All the Polish Saturday schools are named for famous
 
Polish f
j gres.
 The two earliest were named for the
 
first well-known Polish- mericans,  Revolutionary War
 
soldiers Casimir Pulaski and Thaddeus Kosciusko.
 
Other schools are named after figures from World War II,
 
Suc h  as Father 2
1aksimi1ian Kolbe and General Anders, who
 
led a section of the Polish Army which fought with the
 
Allies.
 Copernicus, Paderewski,  Sienkiewicz, •and Chopin
 
Schools are named for well-kno w
n scientists and artists;
 
Maria Konopnicka School commemorates a much-loved
 
The names chosen for the schools underscore :
the in
 
dent, national orientation of the schools,  as opposed to
 
religious affiliation.
 No schools are named for saints,
 
or for the parishes which house them.

 This often

may be able to afford to support their schools a little more

 Rents also var-

depending on the individual parish.
 I believe that all
 
the PTAA schools are currently housed in parish school buildings,
 
though none is formally affiliated with a parish.
 
An unusual example of a close organizational affiliation
 
with a Polish fraternal society is Maria Konopnicka School.
 
Konopnicka is currently the largest PT
LAA school, with 500
 
students,  and is located in the Five Holy Martyrs Parish,
 
seat of the  (Polish)  Bishop Alfred Abramoviicz.
 The school
 
has affiliated with the Polish Roman Catholic Union, which
 
requires that all families in the school belong to the

Teachers in the PT
 System
 
The PTAA offers a variety of services to the teachers
 
in the Polish schools.
 When a teacher arrives from Poland,
 
the PT
 will verify the teaching credential,  and put
 
the teacher on a waiting list.
 They have quite a waiting list,
 
but not everyone on the waiting list is really interested
 
in participating.
 
The PT
. A also o iers teacher training and in-service
 
seminars.
 Education Committee Chairman W. Barczyk constantly
 
attends classes in various schools each Saturday and offers
 
suggestions,
 He also holds biannual 'seminars" in which
 
Ti10  are the PTAA Teachers?
 
The teachers are of course an indispensable part of
 
the Saturday schools.
 t
7hy are they motivated to give up
 
their free Saturdays for a nominal sum, not to mention
 
the unpaid time for preparation,  grading, and any other
 
commitments they make to special projects?
 
Approximately 90 1, of the teachers in the Polish
 
Teachers Association schools are Polish-born and Polish-
educated.
 (These statistics are not regularly kept).

hold a Polish teaching credential from a teachers'  college
 
or advanced degrees from a Polish university.
 
i
lany teachers were moved to beccme involved in educa-
tional activities soon after their arrival in the U . S.  
 in
 
the early 1950's, and were instrumental in forming the
 
various organizations which finally became the PTAA.

In Poland, teachers are put "on a

to help support
 
themselves and their families.
 At the same time, they miss
 
their profession,  "miss children awfully," and want to teach,
 
no matter ho w  little the pay.
 Some say "they only feel like
 
people on Saturdays."
 The most dedicated teachers "always
 
find their way to the Polish Teachers Association" and beg to
 
work, according to the PTAA President, i
Irs.  Ziolkowska.
 
Some may feel strongly that they are wasting their
 
training and talents if they do not teach.
 If they are
 
younger women at home with small children,  they may feel that
 
they I
TdorT
 t want to rust at home."
 
As noted above, teachers'  salaries are minimal,  from
 
$6 to $8 per teaching hour.
 '
or many teachers Saturday
 
scliocl classes amount to volunteer work for their communities,
 
because they must frequently pay baby 
sitters more than they
 
earn.
 :rs.  Zioikowska recalls working in Saturday schools
 
in the mid-1960's for $6.30 per day,  and paying a babysitter
 
$10.00.
 Today the same ratio often holds for teachers with
 
young children.
 
Satisfactions in teaching thus include the desire to
 
practice a loved profession; but teachers also want to he
 
part of efforts to preserve Polish language and culture.
 When
 
they meet children who went through Polish schools, and those
 
children feel that they learned something, and understand
 
and are proud of their Polish background, then their teachers
 
can feel that they have really accomplished something and
 
it is all worth it.
 
The teachers range in age from 25 to 60's.
 Some are
 
22
 
new in the Saturday schools, some have been teaching since
 
the early 50's.
 Some of the newly arrived teachers may
 
have trouble in adjusting to teaching American-raised children,
 
whose attitude toward teachers is not the same as in Europe,
 
where great respect and deference is Shown.
 The PTAA
 
occasionally holds sessions to address these problems, and
 
plans to hold a summer seminar in the future.
 For the most
 
part, however, the principal will offer suggestions.
 
There has been a continuing supply of new teachers from
 
Poland who help to keep the most contemporary Polisn language
 
n the schools, since the post-war immigrant teachers are
 
unfamiliar with changes in the language in Poland in the last
 
twenty to thirty years.
 The Polish-born teachers teach
 
classes of children who come to school speaking some level
 
of Polish, and all instruction is done in Polish.
 
There are also classes for children who do not speak
 
Polish at all, termed "English-speaking classes."  These
 
classes make up onl y  a small part of the total number of
 
Saturday school students.
 PTAA administrators say that this
 
is due, in part, to a lack of qualified teachers who are fluent
 
in both English and Polish.  The

.
Also,,children using Polish essentially as a second language
 
we-
re not at the same level as a Polish class the same age.
 
25
 
The first books used in the schools were obtained
 
from Poland, and Polish publications continue to be used.
 
However, the Polish hooks were not addressed to the needs
 
of the Polish school classes mentioned above.
 
Parents
 
also objected to the content of some his to r y  books and
 
language readers with historical content, which they fit
 
contained "Communist propaganda."  So books had to be sought
 
from other sources for these subjects.
 Some textbook
 
development began in Chicago, as well as in Polish schools
 
in  Canada and England who were facing the same problems.
 
Early attempts at textbook development seem to nay
 
mostly "cut and paste" versions of objectionable Polisl
 
books, taking out the unacceptable parts and rewriting the
 
necessary material.  Walter Rrolokowski has also speculated
 
that nuns in the parochial schools may have done the same
 
thing, for the same reason--to adapt Polish books to the
 
needs of American children.
 
Eventually the PTAA decided that there was a great need
 
for textbooks which simply were not available, and groups
 
of teachers organized to wr ite them.
 The first textbook
 
developed by the PTAA was Polska Mowa (
Polish Language)
,
 
a
 
two-volume introduction to Polish for older children or
 
adults with no knowledge of the language.
 The book was
 
put together by a committee of teachers and published in 19G6
 
in conjunction with the celebration of the Polish millenium.
 
The all-volunteer committee worked about a year 01
1 the
 
26
 
project.
 They considered the work "a donation to our ethnic
 
group, to our culture," as  r. Barczyk put
 
in order to print Polska Z
iowa, each of the authors con-
tr U
. uted a loan.
 A doctor gave then an additional $1000
 
loan, •and
 iktor Barczyk  (without his wife' s knowledge)  put
 
up his home as collateral for the remaining needed money.
 
However,  after the book was published,  everyone was paid back.
 
Polska i
lowa is now in its eighth edition, with 80,000 copies
 
in print.
 It is used in Chicago by different types of Polish
 
classes, both in the Saturday schools and in adult evening
 
classes.
 Polish schools in other English-speaking countries,
 
Canada, England, and Australia, use the book as well.
 
Subsequently Teacher's Manuals for both volumes of
 
Polska i
lowa, in Polish, were published.
 The PTAA points
 
out that there is now a need for the Manuals to be translated
 
into English,  for use by parish school nuns and priests.
 
I would also think that they would be useful for any other
 
American-born teachers who may become involved with Polish
 
schools in the future or even teach night school classes.
 
Other texts developed through early PTAA efforts
 
Include grammars for some grades;  type-written format materials
 
about Copernicus and a Trip to Poland; tapes to accompany
 
Polska Mowa I; and books for Polish language and Mathematics
 
in Polish for use by the Chicago Board of Education.
 
The main efforts of the PTAA in developing textbooks,
 
however,  seen to have come since the formation of the Educ-
27
 
at
-ion Committee in 1975.
 The Education Committee was
 
created expressly to direct efforts to stanaard ze curr -
culum in the various POi± h schools and to develop needed
 
textbooks.
 
out 197
 many f
famil
es began to i
rove out o  tne Po l
isn
 
Triangle area and form Saturday schools in their new,
 
mostly suburban,  locations.
 With this movement, a need arose
 
to standardize curriculum so that students could move easily
 
from one school to another.
 It was also felt that the quality
 
of a child's education depended too much on the individual
 
teacher and that teacher's hooks and m
a
t
e
r
i
a
ls.
 
i
:nuS •
cne
 
Education Committee efforts to standardize curriculum also
 
would help to standardize the quality of education that
 
students received.
 
The Education Committee first developed a Curric
 
Program which includes the following types of classes
 
Kindergarten
 
3 years of elementary school  (for Polish-speaking children)
 
4 years of high school  (for Polish-speaking children)
 
Classes for children who do not speak Polish
 
Classes for adults
 
S1ng na, music, dance and theater prograi
 
The Polish schools differentiate in their class
 
organization between children who come to school with some
 
fluency in Polish (though command of the language varies
 
widely)  and those who come knowing no Polish at all.
 
The first ty e Of class is designated "Polish-speaking,'
 
while the second type is called "English-speaking".
 Of
 
course, children in "Polish-speaking" classes usually speak
 
English too.
 And one teacher referred to the "English-
speaking" classes as "non-speaking" classes, meaning that
 
they didn't speak Polish, not that they didn't know how to
 
talk..
 
For the Polis h-s p e aki ng  classes, the Education Committee
 
has developed an extensive curriculum plan for each year,
 
grades 1-12, for Polish language, history and geography.
 
The plan suggests lesson plans for each Saturday of the
 
school year, and each teacher has a large notebook wit--
h
-
his/her copy.
 It gives the teacher explicit guidelines about
 
what material, to cover and how quickly to cover it.
 However,
 
S 4
 milar guidelines for English-speaking classes have yet
 
to be developed.
 
An extensive English-speaking curricul
u
m plan Ia not
 
really necessary, since children are put in these classes cn i
 
for a few years, then transferred to the Polish-speaking class
 
when they can keep up.
 Ideally stu den ts are
 trans
ferre
d
 
into Polish-speaking classes within two years.
 A plan for
 
the first two years of the Eng 1 ish - s eaking classes would
 
probably prove useful.
 
The PT
 has donated a copy of this curriculum plan
 
to the Ethnic Schools Project, and it should be very useful
 
in a more extensive analysis of their curricul u
m materials.

number of textbooks and secondary materials since 1975.

hen-a new book is being developed,  a script or typevritten

 This script is tested for a year

such as the Polish Battle Hymn, Polish traditions, and an
 
English version of "Polish Historical Excerpts."  Mr. Barczyk
 
makes copies of these materials available to the Saturday
 
school teachers, who can use them as lecture outlines or as
 
study materials for older students.
 
This is not a complete listing of all the materials used
 
in the PTAA schools.
 For more information refer to the
 
curriculum materials donated to the Ethnic School Project,
 
and to the list of textbooks available/price list which is
 
attached to this report.
 
"Extracurricular" Curriculu:
  
The Education Committee's Curriculum Plan includes
 
in theory singing, music, dance and theater instruction.
 
In practice, what is available in any given school depends
 
on the teacher available to teach these subjects.
 In
 
addition, these subjects are not mandatory.
 Students may
 
participate, but they must stay an hour later or come an
 
hour later in their school day for the class.
 Activities
 
include, at various schools, drama club, choir, dance groups
 
or instruction, poetry recitation, and the like.
 
I could not get an exact idea of how these activities
 
are regarded within the sphere of the schools' activities,
 
and teachers
 
and I am sure it varies over the years.
 Some parents seemed
 
to feel that these were "nice" activities but not really
 
as important as the rest of the curriculum; others that only
 
children who were "talented" would want to participate;
 
others that it would be ideal for all to participate but
 
there are never enough teachers for all students to do so.
 
These attitudes are an interesting contrast to some
 
second- and third-generation ethnic groups who do not empha-
size language learning but express ethnic learning
 - 
through encouraging their children to participate in artistic
 
activities such as dance groups.  A much more in-depth look
 
at the variety of "extracurricular" subjects and attitudes
 
toward them is needed before any solid comments can be made.
 
hISTORY O  GENERAL CASIhIIR PULASKI SCI-

,COL/POLSKA SZKOLA
 
im. GEN. KAZIMIERZA PULASKIEGO
 
General Pulaski School is currently located in the
 
St. Wenceslaus Roman Catholic Parish School building,  at
 
3435 N.  Lawndale, Chicago.
 The Principal is Jozef Zurczak,
 
and Witold Pawlokowski is the President of the Parent-
Teacher --Association and the School Board.
 Pulaski Schon
 
is the oldest of the Polish Saturday schools in Chicago.
 
Accounts of Pulaski School history vary somewhat, but
 
the School marks its beginnings from 1951.
 Pulaskits
 
twenty-fifth anniversary was celebrated in 1976.
 Pulaski
 
School grew out of classes sponsored by the Pedagogical
 
Section of the Circle of Polish Teachers and Graduates
 
Abroad, beginning with thirty-two students meeting in a
 
building belonging to the Polish Women's Alliance.
 
The first principal of Pulaski School was Zgymunt
 
Wygocki.
 Historical accounts  (in the Silver Jubilee books
 
of both Pulaski School and the PTAA)  include names of prin-
cipals and teachers over the years, who could probably be
 
contacted for more information.
 A Parent-Teacher Association
 
was formed in 1956.
 
Pulaski School first met in various locations in the
 
Polish Triangle area, around Division and Milwaukee Streets
 
on Chicago's Near Northwest side.
 In 1959,  the school used
 
the Anderson Public School building on Division St.,  and in
 
34
 
1960 moved to the Holy Trinity Parish School building on
 
Division between Cleaver and Noble Streets.
 Holy Trinity is
 
one of the two oldest Polish parishes in Chicago.
 Pulaski
 
School remained in this facility until 1978.
 
During this time the number of students grew from
 
the original thirty-two to 200 in 1955.
 in  1961 there were
 
850 students, and in that year the first high school class
 
was formed.
 Because of the school's growth,  extra classrooms
 
were needed.
 For awhile,  some of the classes met nearby at
 
St. Stanislaus Kostka,  the other of Chicago's oldest Polish
 
arishes.
 However,  the priest and sister/principal of the
 
Darish school did not support Pulaski's use of the building;
 
30  the Polish Veterans offered the use of their building on
 
:
cod St.  for the High School classes.
 
Ln 1970 Pulaski had 1000 students.
 But about this time,
 
ma oC oia ces came to t:e old Polish neighborhood.
 The city
 
of Chicago was building expressways through the city, and one
 
went through the heart of the neighborhood.
 It was only with
 
combined community effort that the two great Polish churches,
 
Holy Trinity and St. Stanislaus Kostka, were saved from demo-
Many Polish residents were moved out by urban renewal,
 
with promises that they could return to the low-income housing
 
which was to be be built.
 But after the housing was built,
 
the projects became predominantly black;  the Poles never returned.
 
Now the area is predominantly Hispanic, but some Polish
 
businesses remain,  as well as the churches.

Pulaski School does not offer the entire range of classes
 
listed under the PTAA "umbrella" discussed above.
 Classes
 
are available only for children who come with some knowledge
 
o f Polish;  grades 1-3 and four years of high school are offered.
 
About ten percent of the students are from the St. Wenceslaus

i.e.  they also live in the immediate neighborhood),
 
and others come from other parts of the city or from suburbs,

attend suburban schools nearer their homes,  several reasons
 
keep some students commuting in -to the city.

some come to attend the same school other children in the
 
family attended;  some come because Pulaski has a high school,
 
and they want to attend the same school all twelve years.
 
Pulaski School Administration
  
Educationally, Pulaski School subscribes to the PTAA
 
curriculum guidelines.
 Administratively,
 however, Pulaski
 
like all the PTAA schools,  is independent.
 
Pulaski is run by a School Board and the Parent-TeacLier
 
(PTA)
 
Association.
 All parents with children at Pulaski are auto-
matically members of the Parent-Teacher Association,  and
 
some "old" parents, whose children have graduated, also
 
remain involved.
 The PTA is responsible for fund-raising
 
for the school.
 Two fund-raising dances are held each year,
 
at Christmas and Easter.
 
School officers are elected once a year:
 a President,
 
three Vice-presidents, Secretary, and Treasurer.
 In addition,
 
about twenty-three people are elected to a committee which
 
does most of the support work needed,or brings in extra
 
people as necessary.
 
ost of the money that keeps Pulaski going come from
 
tuition.
 Parents pay $75 per child pei
ear;  $85 for two
 
children from the same family; and $90 for three children.
 
So parents pay a minimal fee for Polish school.
 Yet tuition
 
raised $14,000 last year, •a sizable part of the $15,000-
$18,000 operating budget of the school.
 Two dances are con-
sidered to be all the fund-raising necessary.
 
37
 
Pulaski also receives some money from the PTi
 from
 
funds which are donated to the PT
A school system.
 (
See
 
PTAA section).
 The Polish National Alliance donation
 
mentioned above,  $1 per child to each school,  amounted to
 
$350 for Pulaski last year.
 
t
1hat are the school's expenses?
 Teacher's salaries
 
and rent are the main ones.
 Teachers are paid very little,
 
due to the limited budget.
 Teachers at Pulaski receive
 
$100 per month for teaching five hours  (two sessions)  per
 
Saturday.
 The Principal receives $125 per month.
 
Pulasici rents classrooms from St. '
Jenceslaus,
 
at $45 per month per classroom.
 The rent was recently raised
 
from $35 per month per classroom.
 The monthly rent at
 
this time is $427, about $4000 per year.
 
Other,  smaller expenses add up to.
 At Christmas,
 
St. Nicholas  (the Polish "Santa Claus")  visits the school
 
and distributes small gifts to the children.
 At the
 
annual Christmas show presented by the students the school
 
pays for refreshments.
 Occasionally material for costumes
 
for children's performances must be purchased.
 (
In this
 
regard, however, Pulaski says it is fortunate.
 Because it
 
is an old school, a store of costumes has been built up
 
which belong to the school.)
 
The school pays for awards which are given to students
 
at the end of the year for good behavior,  attendance, and
 
accomplishment.
 Diplomas are provided by the school.
 The
 
diplomas for graduating high school seniors are beautifully
 
38
 
printed in both Polish and English,  so that should the
 
student need to show the diploma it would not need to be
 
translated.
 (
See the collection of auxiliary materials
 
donated to the project by the PTAA).
 Although the PTA
 
has developed standardized diplomas,  Pulaski has had its
 
diplomas also printed with the school name on them.
 
For the graduating high school senior,  the school
 
also arranges a banquet, provides small gifts for the
 
students,  and pays for some invited guests.
 The small gifts
 
and awards in the past might have been books,  records or
 
medals.
 Now a medal has been decided upon, and a special
 
"Pulaski School" medal with the head of Pulaski on it is
 
being struck.
 This year's seniors did not receive this
 
medal, as it was not yet ready.
 
Lae School Board meets the first L
ionday of
:
 ne -L
i
on ' , 
in the parish hall at 7:30 PM.  The Board authorizes
 
expenditures; in some cases, officers have authorized emer-
gency expenditures and the Board approves them (
or not).
 
If there is a school problem, the Principal attends.  The
 
Board meetings are not open to all parents;  they used to be
 
invited, but it did not work out too well.
 Pulaski also
 
has had problems getting parents to attend an annual Parents
 
l
Iseting.
 Now this meeting is combined with Board elections,
 
and about 150 people attend.
 The terms of the officers
 
elected are for one year, but they can easily be renewed,
 
"for as long as you wish to spend a lot of time with no pay,"
 
39
 
as Pulaski Vice-President  ;
illiam Bogdanowicz put it.
 
;hen a principal is needed,  the teachers elect the
 
new person.
 The Board then approves, or vetoes, the selection.
 
Pulaski School has chosen to remain unaffiliated
 
with any outside organization,  such as the Polish National
 
Alliance or Polish Roman Cathoi c Union, because 'they would
 
want to tell us what to do."
 They have never gone to outslde
 
sources for mon v, with the exception of donations once
 
solicited from local businesses.
 That attempt was not very
 
successful,  and they dropped the idea.
 They try to live
 
within their budget,  and accept only donations.

iktor Barczyk very kindly accompanied us on all our
 
school visits.
 He met us both days at Pulaski School at
 
the beginning of the school day, visited all the classrooms
 
with us, .explained to me what was going on while George
 
i
ledakovich recorded the classes, and introduced me to a l
l
 
the school personnel.
 Everyone was most gracious and helpful.
 
Pulaski School meets in the parish school building of
 
Uenceslaus parish.
 Physically, Chicago Roman Catholic
 
parishes are massive arrays of buildings, often including
 
a church, school buildings, auxiliary buildings such as
 
living quarters for teaching nuns and the pastro.
 St. Wen-
ceslaus, like many other parishes, occupies an entire bloc::,
 
not counting the church which is located nearby.
 
The buildings themselves are solid brick structures.
 
The school has a basement and two stories above.
 Teaching
 
nuns are t
h e mainstays of the parish schools hut I do not
 
know what order teaches there.
 
I have visited a number
 
schools, and was struck by the particularly elaborate
 
religious decorations of the St. Wenceslaus classrooms.
 
Each room seemed to have altars to the Madonna or Madonna
 
and Child, .
as well as numerous other religious reminders,
 
sayings, and decorations.
 
in the hail, located in the basement of the school,
 
Pulaski has a small storeroom where they keep their library
 
41
 
and store of materials and textbooks wh1Cn are sold to
 
students.
 The-
--
hall is used as a place for parents to social-
ize while waiting for their children.
 Only a few seemed
 
to wait, however; they talked, read the newspaper, and
 
played with younger children with them.
 School supplies,
 
coffee, Polish import coo
+
s,  and  homemade
 paczki  (
a kind
 
of jelly doughnut)  are sold.
 
There are ten classes in session both before and
 
after noon.
 The morning session meets from 9:00-11:30
 
and the afternoon session from 12:00 to 2:00.
 Grades
 
1-3 meet in two sections, one group before and one group
 
after lunch.
 Two of the high  school classes meet before
 
lunch, and the other two after lunch.
 Students who par-
ticipate in the "extracurricular" activities either stay
 
after the morning session or come early before the afternoon
 
session.
 
Over the two days we visited Pulaski, we observed
 
a first, second, third, fifth, and eighth grade classes
 
as well as second year and third year high school classes.
 
During these visits we tape-recorded and photographed the
 
classes.
 
One theme we noted in all the classrooms at Pulaski
 
was discipline.
 This was also stressed by parents and
 
administrators as one of the goals of the teaching method.
 
This means that classes are quiet, even first grade; chil-
dren quietly raise their hands to answer questions, then
 
stand by their desks to give their response.
 
42
 
However, teachers in the youngest grades could also be
 
affectionate with their students.  We visitors were some-
thing of a distraction in the elementary grades  we visited,
 
but the high school classes ignored us.
 
We were also told that various kinds of teaching activ-
ities are used in the classrooms, such as tapes, slide-tape
 
programs, and films, but these were not used the days we
 
were there.
 In all of the classes the students sat in
 
rows of desks Lacing the front of the r
o
o
m ;
 the teacher
 
stood at the front and directed very structured activities.
 
In the first grade class, I was greeted by the teacher
 
(
a woman in her forties who is the only Pulaski teacher to
 
hold both Polish and American teaching credentials) with,
 
"Oh, so they send someone who doesn't speak Polish to the
 
Polish schools".
 She explained during the visit that although
 
her students speak Polish at home, her classes are essentially
 
teaching Polish as a second language.
 The influence of
 
English at school and on TV is too pervasive for Polish to
 
compete.
 
The class was working on differentiation of the sounds
 
"b" and "p", reading a sentence off the board.
 Students
 
were asked to come up to the board and correct mistakes in
 
the sentence.
 The teacher said that they were working on
 
basic literacy skills in Polish, reading and writing.
 
The second grade class was taught by a younger teacher,
 
recently arrived from Poland, who spoke next to no English.
 
43
 
There were 17 children in the afternoon second grade class,
 
including one Down's child.
 (
The Down's child came with her
 
two siblings.
 She is not disruptive but the teacher seemed
 
a little at a loss about how to include her in the class.)
 
The lesson was on Father's Day (dzien Ojca), also cele-
brated in Poland.
 The teacher stood at the front of the
 
class and led discussion about fathers.
 Students came to
 
the board to write down sentences the class was making up.
 
Then the class copied the sentences they have constructed
 
and corrected off the board; the teacher supervised them to
 
make sure that they copy correctly.
 
The children use script exclusively; printing is not
 
taught, and the second graders were already comfortable
 
writing.
 (This is Polish custom, •and I understand it was
 
also followed in the Polish parochial schools.)
 
The teacher explained that the next week she would
 
work on reading, both texts they have worked on, and sight-
reading.
 At the end of the year, she collects their writing
 
exercise books for grading, and displays the best ones.
 
The third grade class teacher was Mrs. Zurczak.
 She
 
is 70, and seems very grandmotherly in her classroom manner.
 
We came in in the middle of a lesson in which the children
 
were taking different characters and reading a story.  The
 
students were eagerly waving their hands for the parts
 
they wanted, and barely paid our entrance any attention.
 
After the reading session, •the children wrote indiv-
idual short themes on what they had read.
 Composition is
 
begun in the third grade.
 The children seemed to have
 
mastered script.
 Then there  was  a short dictation.  As
 
we le: t, the children sang a song, standing by their desks.
 
The fifth grade class was studying Polish history,
 
using the PTIul textbook.
 Fifth graders start history as
 
a separate subject.
 There were three girls and three boys
 
in this afternoon session.
 (
The afternoon sessions are
 
generally smaller than the morning ones;  students prefer to
 
come in the morning).
 This class seemed very distracted
 
by our presence, and we did not stay long.
 The teacher
 
was a young woman.
 The topics for the day were written on
 
the board, and the teacher was trying to get discussion
 
going; the students were not being very cooperative.
 
We observed Mrs. Maria Kozuchowska's eighth grade
 
class twice, in order to see both a Polish language and a
 
history lesson.
 The history class was discussing occupied
 
Poland during World War II.  The lecture topics were on
 
the board, and the teacher used several large maps in her
 
lecture.
 One was a large printed map of Europe, but she
 
had hand-drawn two smaller ones with more detail of Poland.
 
When we observed her English class, Mrs. Kozuchowska
 
was lecturing on Maria Konopnicka, the poet.
 She was using
 
a PTAA script which is being tested.
 The teacher explained
 
the poems, then students read from the script.
 She then
 
answered questions and explained vocabulary.
 
Mr. Barczyk showed us Mrs. Kozuchowska's lesson plan
 
book.
 This document  (
pre-printed books prepared by the PTAA)
 
included attendance, roll, lesson plans according to the
 
PT A curriculum guidelines, notes on what was covered each
 
45
 
and
. homework assignments.
 Mr. Barczyk showed me that she
 
had kept her book up to date.
 (A sample is included in the
 
materials donated to the Project by the PTAA).
 Homework
 
assignments for the next week were written on the board.
 
:
:rs.  Kozuchowska is a veteran Polish schools teacher
 
and has also collaborated on some of the textbook development.
 
The third grade of high school  (11th grade,  though they
 
do not call high school grades 9-12)  which we visited was
 
taught by Dr. Maria Kras, who holds the Ph.D.  from
 
Jagellonian University in Krakow.
 Jagellonian is the oldest
 
and most respected Polish university and Pulaski is very
 
proud to have Dr. Kras on the faculty.
 She is also doing
 
graduate work here and teaching at Loyola University.
 
The class was also working on Maria Konopnicka's
 
poetry.
 There were seven students in the class.
 They
 
read poems,  then Dr. Kras explained the meaning
 
on a student to explain it.
 The students were u:
 
text printed in Warsaw for use in Polish schools.
 
The last class we visited at Pulaski was a second year
 
high school  (i.e.  10th grade)  class taught by Maria Neumann.
 
Mrs. Neumann has been at Pulaski for seventeen years, and is
 
a dedicated teacher.
 She apologized for her heavily accented,
 
sometimes halting English, but she explained to me her activ-
ities with her students over the years with few problems.
 
Mrs. Neumann showed us her personal library of materials
 
gathered over many years for the use of her students.
 Five
 
floor-to-ceiling metal cabinets crammed full of hooks on
 
Polish literature, history,  art,  dictionaries,  and
. encyclo-
46
 
pedias have been collected.
 She has begged, bought and
 
accepted
 
books to
 
posters.
 
donations from individuals who wanted to give their
 
the school.
 She also has teaching aids such as
 
A few times she sponsored her class in t
h e Chicago-
wide netro History Fair, a project run for h
h school
 
history classes on the same principle as science fairs.
 
Public and private schools all over the Chicago area partic-
ipate, and I was impressed that a Saturday school class would
 
get involved.
 
The class we observed with Mrs. Neumann was on art
 
history, with a discussion ranging from Chopin to Cubism.
 
I was fortunate to have with me for part of this class
 
an outside Polish-speaking observer, Frances Drwal.  Ms.
 
Drwal is mentioned earlier in this report in the section
 
on the Polish parochial school system, which she attended.
 
She speaks contemporary Polish and is herself a teacher,
 
and told me that the class was doing college level worL.
 
She considered their Polish to be fluent and "unaccented. ,
, 
She. also felt that Mrs. Neumann was a teacher who loved her
 
material very much, and that this showed very clearly in
 
her presentation.
 
A true teacher, 1
45. Drwal told the class afterwards
 
how impressed she was and how she wished this type of school
 
had been available when she was younger.
 
As. Drwal's evaluation of this classroom greatl
 
enhanced my appreciation of the students' accomplishments.
 
In order to evaluate the level of class material, the fluency
 
and accents students have mastered, a Polish speaker should
 
47
 
observe the classrooms.
 
Although no testing was going on during our visits,
 
we were told that tests are part of the basis of students'
 
grades.
 Teachers are given their choice of testing styles.
 
Students'  notebooks and homework are also regularly collected
 
and graded and form part of the final grades.
 
During our first visit to Pulaski, we also attended
 
a "
!other's Day program which was put on by some of the
 
elementary age students, who work with the "extracurricular'
 
teacher.
 The program included poetry recitation,  songs,
 
and awards to a few mothers.
 
A number of people at Pulaski had Solidarity buttons
 
on their lapels.
 I was even given one when I came into
 
one of the classrooms.
 Earlier, •at the Polish Constitution
 
Day Parade, .
1 also noted that the PT
 float was decorated
 
in su port of Solidarity.
 
THE SENIOR BANQUET
 
Pulaski
 
I also attended the banquet for graduating high school
 
seniors, held at the Oaza Palm Terrace on 2
iilwaukee Ave.,  in
 
the old Polish neighborhood.
 It was very nicely organized,
 
with a table at the front for the graduates  (seven this year),
 
fairly short speeches, presentation of a "certificate of merit"
 
from the Cook County Superintendent of Schools  (doesn't mean
 
anything but it's 
.a nice gesture), and presentation of
 
medals and diplomas.
 Mrs. Neumann, the "homeroom teacher",  also
 
gave short speeches recognizing a special achievement of each
 
graduate.
 
43
 
Parents
 
Parents are the core o
:  the Polish schools.
 Parents
 
feel the need for them, they organize them,  they bring their
 
children to them, and they make the children keep with it
 
over the years.
 School administrators and students all insist
 
that parents are the key to the Polish Saturday schools.
 
Parents'  i
otivatjons
  
The Polish Saturday schools in Chicago were begun by
 
parents who came to the U.S. as displaced persons after t
'orld
 
War II, and the schools have continued to reflect largely
 
their needs and concerns.
 All the parents I spoke to were
 
of this generation, and all were also both Pulaski parents
 
and PT.IA or Pulaski School administrators.
 
I
any of the current Pulaski School parents, however,
 
are younger Polish immigrants, who have arrived since the
 
late 1960's.
 These parents came predominantly for economic
 
rather than for political reasons,  and have different motiva-
tions for sending their children to Polish school.
 I did
 
not speak with any of these parents, who seemed to speak
 
mostly Polish.
 A Polish speaker is really necessary to
 
explore their reasons further.
 However, the parents I did
 
speak with mentioned several areas of difference between them-
selves and the more recent immigrants.
 
Although each "generation" of parents seems to have
 
different reasons for sending their children to Polish school,
 
there are also individual emphases within each group.
 I
 
have only touched on the nuances involved in these issues.
 
49
 
Yet another "generation" of parents involved in the
 
PT
 schools  (though not at Pulaski)  are American-born
 
parents who do not speak Polish in the home, whose children
 
attend the English-speaking classes  (see Kolbe School section
 
for more information on these parents).
 
The main issues involved in the Polish schools, however,
 
focus around language maintenance or language learning, and
 
on education in subjects related to Polish culture,history,
 
and traditions.
 "Being Polish," speaking Polish, and par-
ticipating in Polish ethnic organizations are variously
 
valued by different generations and individuals.
 
The main concerns of the founders of the Saturday Schools
 
focused on language maintenance.
 These parents speak Polish
 
at home with their children, but wanted them to become lit-
erate in Polish and to know Polish literature.
 They felt
 
that a formal educational environment would be better than
 
trying to teach these subjects at home.
 Also important,
 
but perhaps a bit less so to parents who focused on language
 
maintenance, was formal education in Polish culture and
 
history.
 nother parent, however, indi ca ted the reverse �
 
he
 
wanted his children "to learn the heritage and history...
 
oh, and to keep up the language."
 
Since the children who enter Pulaski already speak Polish
 
to some extent, and the main thrust of the curriculum is
 
geared to increasingly sophisticated command of the language,
 
language learning and other Polish subjects are inevitably
 
intertwined.
 In fact, before the Education Committee estab-
lished guidelines for the curriculum which called for
 
50
 
separate classes in history and geography from fifth grade on,
 
these subjects were äI  taught within the Polish language
 
classes.
 
More recent immigrants have brought different viewpoints
 
towards "Polishness" and Polish education into the schools.
 
Post-war immigrant parents, for examp1e,  prefer that all
 
classes begin and end with a prayer, although there is no
 
other religious instruction involved.
 The newer immigrants,
 
who grew up in the contemporary Polish school system completely
 
separated from the church, are not used to prayers in school
 
classrooms.
 They are also not as likely to send their chil-
dren to parochial/schools; unused to religious involvement
 
in education, it seems an unnecessary expense.
 
The post-war generation parents also felt that the
 
newer immigrant parents had only more recently developed
 
an interest in the Polish schools; that their first concerns
 
had been to come to the U.S., get a job and start the children
 
learning English.  i
laintaining Polish language was not a
 
first priority.
 This is of course a very different situation
 
from those immigrants who came because they did not want
 
to live in Communist Poland, and as refugees felt a strong
 
need to express and maintain their sense of national identity
 
and to pass this on to their children.
 
51
 
Frequently they
 
value highly college
 
also perceive Polish
 
are well -educated professionals, and
 
education for their children.
 They
 
school as a way to "upgrade," and
 
add another dimension to their children's basic education.
 
These parents are proud of Poland's history, accomplish ments,
 
and contributions and want their children to share that pride.
 
These differences in perspective were eloquently
 
expressed by Helena Ziokowska, PT?  President:
 
"People who came to this country from Europe in early
 
'
50's and late  '
40's were survivors of World War
 
were very patriotic.
 And to them survival meant
 
Polish and to keep the Polish language and faith
 
II, and they
 
to be
 
and trad-
itions...If these people were able to transfer their mot-
ivations and feelings to the next generation, then these
 
children have children now and they send
 
schools.
 But not all of them succeeded.
 
childrenj went to Polish schools because
 
them to Polish
 
Some of  L
he
 
they had to, and
 
once they got married,  sometimes to people of different
 
nationality, they didn't pay that much attention...
 
But people who come from Poland right now are of dif-
ferent stock.
 Thirty years of Communist infiltration did
 
the job.
 L
Iany of them don't feel that they should keep up
 
the Polish tradition.
 Not everybody but quite a big per-
centage assimilates very quickly.
 They don't talk Polish
 
at home... It's very sad .
.. I don't feel sorry-for them, I
 
feel sorry for their children because they end up nct )nowing
 
nn-thin7
 
52
 
As I
Irs. Ziolkowska points out, there is also a new
 
group of potential Polish school parents appearing--Polish
 
school graduates who are beginning to establish their own
 
families now.
 It was noted that several marriages have even
 
resulted from acquaintance in Polish school. 1 It would be
 
interesting to follow these graduates to see if they send
 
their children to Polish school.
 And if they do, do they
 
continue their parents' main concerns, do they fit more
 
closely with other American-barn parents' concerns, or do
 
they form a separate group with new and different concerns?
 
The founding generation of the Polish schools immigrated
 
over a fairly brief period of time, and its children are
 
almost grown.
 The youngest members of this generation, who
 
were young children
. themselves when the war started, are
 
now in their 50's and their oldest children are in high school.
 
At Pulaski there seems to be a mix of post-war and recent
 
i m
migrant parents.
 But as the post-war generation's children
 
graduate from the Polish schools, the demographics of the
 
schools will have to change.
 It will be very interesting
 
to follow the Polish schools to see how they adapt to the
 
needs of the next generation of Polish- A
merican children.
 
The post-war parents cited new interest both from new
 
immigrant parents and American-born parents in recent years.
 
As mentioned earlier, total enrollment in the PTAA schools
 
increased by 1000 students between 1930 and 1982.
 It might
 
53
 
be helpful in trying to predict future directions foi
 
the Polish schools to talk in depth to parents from these
 
groups to find out what their perceived needs are and
 
what directions they would like for the Polish schools to
 
take.
 It seems reasonable that if the Polish Saturday
 
schools are to continue after the founding generation ceases
 
to be involved, new directions are inevitable.
 
It would be especially interesting to note whether
 
American-born parents find a way to increase participation
 
for English-speaking students in these schools  (
now only
 
10-l5a system-wide)
 
2
irs.  Ziolkowska explained that American-born parents
 
had not been much involved with the Polish schools.
 She
 
felt that the schools were begun by a collaboration of
 
people with similar interests, who have focused on survival
 
and developing their concept.
 "Tay back in the '50's no one
 
from outside that circle wanted to join the schools.  Nobody
 
was interested.
 Polish was not in fashion.. .It was a rather
 
closed group, and it was fine for t
h e time. . .
TTe d d no -'
-
-
-
put out ads. .
.
.because we have problems with the physical
 
facilities .
.. we cannot get too many classrooms, af
id we try
 
not to charge too much.
 And if you have larger classes
 
and if you have more educated people, people who have to
 
speak :nglish, you have to pay them more.
 
t
'
 She feels that
 
American children  (
o  polish descent)  are not interested
 
in Polish 
w
 
 schools, but  ould rather have their weekends free.
 
54
 
Time and Effort
  
Parents who send their children to Saturday school pay
 
a small tuition fee; but they are often making a considerable
 
sacrifice of time and effort.
 Saturday may be the parents'
 
only free day for shopping -
-.
.
and errands, and coming to
 
Pulaski is a 40-60 mile round trip for suburban families.

motivation from the parents as well as the children.
 
Parents also attend occasional Parent Teacher neetin s
 
and special shows which the children present at holidays.
 
The big events are at Christmas and Easter.
 Some parents
 
become quite involved and donate a lot of time to helping
 
out with fund-raising activities, organizing the children's
 
performances, and serving on the School Board.
 Others with
 
less time to give just manage to get the children there.
 
Several parents complained that their whole Saturday is
 
shot; they usually try to plan other L
activities like music
 
lessons or Scout meetings for the kids on the same day in
 
order to make as few trips around town as possible.  The
 
school tries to minimize trips by planning rehearsals for
 
special shows during regular school hours.
 
Parents' monitoring of homework, like their commitment
 
to speaking Polish in the home, seems to vary.
 Comments by
 
administrators indicated that students with more help and
 
encouragement with homework at home generally were higher
 
55
 
Some parents involve the ir children in other ethnic
 
organizations such as dance groups, Scouts, and fraternal
 
organizations.
 Others don't seem to stress this, and children
 
are involved in activities like cheerleading, etc.
 
College education for their children seemed to be a
 
high priority of the parents I spoke to, who were themselves
 
college graduates.
 Cuttings in the scrapbook of successful
 
graduates indicated pride in their further educational
 
achievements.
 
It would be very interesting to ascertain what
 
di ferences there are between families whose children
 
graduate from Polish school  and families who would prefer
 
:
hat their children continue, but children resist the
 
arental pressure and drop out.
 
56
 
Students
  
All of this time and effort is aimed at providing
 
education for the children.  What gets them to give up their
 
free time on Saturdays to go to school?  What keeps them
 
there for up to twelve years?
 
I spoke to a number of students at Pulaski, mostl
 
from the eighth grade and the second and third year high
 
school classes.  A pattern quickly emerged:
 their parents
 
make them go for a few years, then the children themselves
 
either just "get used to it," get really interested, or drop
 
out.
 
Certainly many more children start Polish school than
 
graduate.
 The high school especially requires a great deal
 
of effort because the material becomes more challenging.
 
Helena Ziolkowska thus characterized the Polish school
 
high school graduates:
 "Only dedicated and motivated students
 
really survive and go through high school.
 But once they
 
finish you really can converse with them fluently.., they have
 
good knowledge of literature, can write a good paper."
 
When I asked
 two
 
older  classes why they
 
were in Polish school, I got very dissimilar answers,
 
although both groups interpreted the question as "why are
 
you studying Polish language;" they did not comment on the
 
other aspects of their Polish school experiences.  An eighth
 
grade class
 stressed being there to learn Polish in order
 
to have a foreign language skill.
 These students wanted to
 
get credit for a language in college (though not all colleges
 
will do this); and to get ahead in business or a career with
 
NOTE:

Text flows coherently from page 56 to page 58.
 
58
 
a second language.
 Those who spoke out were very goal-oriented;
 
Polish language w
a s
 going to be useful for getting ahead
 
in life.
 
Another high school class had a very different outlook.
 
Perhaps two-thirds of the class members had visited Poland,
 
and all had relatives there.
 The usefulness of being able
 
to speak Polish with relatives and get around in Poland
 
had been forcefully and personally brought home to students
 
during their visits.
 No other reasons for learning Polish
 
were mentioned by this class.
 
T
7hen the school administrators found out that I wanted
 
students'  reactions, they very kindly made a few minutes
 
available to me at the end of several classes for discussion
 
with the students.
 iost of my comments from students c
' T
 
from these sessions, which were somewhat strained.
 The
 
students did not seem to feel comfortable even when I asked
 
them to come up to the front of the room and just talk to
 
me rather than answering questions from their seats.
 Conver-
sations with students whom I caught in passing were much more
 
relaxed,  and I would suggest informal talks in school during
 
breaks or making appointments to visit students at home
 
for more information in this area.
 
I had no way of contacting students who dropped out of
 
Polish school to get their point of view, but I did meet one
 
such family at the Pulaski School Graduation Banquet.
 I sat
 
at a table with a woman who had come to see a friend's daughter
 
59
 
graduate.
 Two of her children were also with her, and one,
 
a girl about twelve, had attended Polish school for awhile.
 
The family speaks Polish,  and the mother's English
 
is usable but not fluent.
 The girl told me that she did
 
not want to give up her Saturdays to go to school when she
 
had to go to school all week.
 She preferred to go on trips
 
or just "hang out'7 with her friends.
 The mother would like
 
for the children to go to Polish school, but can't make them
 
go.
 The oldest child in the family,  another daughter, had
 
gone to Polish school for a few years,  and can read Polish.
 
i
ly acquaintance said she had not learned to read,  but did not
 
seem too upset by this.
 
For a detailed description of one Pulaski high school
 
graduate's experiences in Polish school, see section on

 She too was
 
forced to attend Polish school, then got interested and stayed

i 'J
 :
ive Saturdays,  and even as a second
 
situation well enough to exploit
 
er parents'  desire for her to attend--she demanded a go-go
 
skirt and boots if she agreed to go that year.
 But in assessing
 
what has stayed with her since, Ms. Witkowski stresses not
 
her language ability  (which parents and current students
 
stressed)  but knowledge of Polish history and culture, and
 
the self-confidence and pride in being Polish which resulted.

FATHER

I
 made one visit to Father Hoihe School to see the
 
other parts of the PT
 "umbrella" program which are not
 
offered at Pulaski School:
 kindergarten and classes for
 
Engl sh-speak ng ch ildren.
 Father Kolbe School is located
 
in St.  Constance Roman Catholic Parish Scnool building on
 
t
ile  ar nor -'
Cnwest corner of  the city of  Chicago,  at- 5341
 
W.  Strong.
 Not far away rrom St.  Constance IS  tne Copernicus
 
Center, a new Polish neighborhood center and educat ona1
 
foundation.
 
Father i
larcin Borowczyk is the priest at St. Constance.
 
Father Borowczyi, who is in his 60's,  is part of what may be
 
the last generation of Polish-speaking Polish-american priests.
 
He speaks fluent"Chicago Polish", •and gives sermons and hears
 
confessions in Polish.
 
When Father Borowczyk learned some years ago that a
 
number of his parishioners were traveling long distances to
 
take their children to Polish school, he went to the PTAA
 
and invited a school to make its home in his parish.
 Father
 
Kolbe School opened in 1974.
 Forty-six families are parish-
ioners, and ninety-seven are from outside the parish, out
 
of the total of one hundred and forty-three families.
 
There are about 250 students.
 
Since Father Borowczyk considers the school a parish-
sponsored activity, parishioners pa y a littl e less tuition:
 
$70 per child per year/$30 for two children from the same
 
family/$90 for three children.
 Non-parishioners pay $10
 
more per child.

 Then we went to observe the two
 
English-speaking classes, which meet only during the morning
 
session.
 
The two English-speaj
'I-ing classes include a begi nning
 
class, whicil has students
 
also with a range of ages.
 
had to leave school early
 
M 
ages 5-12,  and a more advanced class,
 
One of the regular teachers had
 
this year,  and her class was taug.-i
l
k
:
 
M 
62
 
by a substitute.
 Both English-speaking class teachers had
 
si:ii ar histories,  and in fact had been good friends for many
 
years.
 Josephine Nocula,  substituting in the beginning class,
 
and Anna Grzeskiewicz were born in Europe  (but not in Poland)
 
and came to the U.S. about age 5.
 They grew up speaking
 
Polish at home, but did not attend the Polish Saturday schools.
 
They both teach in public schools, as well as teaching English
 
as a Second Language to Polish immigrants three evenings
 
a week.
 One is single, but the other has four children.
 
In both classes, the tone of the class seemed different
 
from the tone of similar level classes in the Polish-speaking
 
program.
 There seemed to be a "freer" feeling;  children were
 
not required to be absolutely silent and did not always
 
stand by their desks when answering a question.
 Whether
 
these seeming differences reflect t
1 e individual teachers'
 
styles, or their American  (as opposed to Polish)  teacher
 
training, .
or because the children are not used to the Polish
 
style of discipline in the classroom,  I could not tell.
 
In the primary class,  students were coloring and
 
answering questions about the pictures they were working on.
 
The teacher used the books also as the basis for asking
 
questions which used vocabular and reinforced grammatical
 
structures.
 While we were there she spoke in English
 
except when working on a particular sentence.
 The class was
 
learning nominative and objective cases that day.
 
If
l the older class,  the teacher also spoke primarily
 
in English.
 First that day students presented scrapbooks
 
63
 
of clippings on Polish topics which they had assembled.
 
presentations were in English.
 The students also talked
 
about what they had gotten out
 
The next part of t
ile class was
 
Polish sentences.
 The teacher
 
of Polish school that year.
 
a game of "telephone" using
 
took a few students out of
 
the room to give them the phrase,  then the students rushed
 
back to their groups and passed the sentence around.
 The
 
first group to repeat the correct sentence "won."
 Again,
 
this activity struck me as very different, with students
 
running and noisy,  from the kinds of things we observed in
 
the more sedate Polish-speaking classes.
 
The students in the English-speaking classes were
 
mostly,  if not all,  from "mixed marriages" where one parent
 
is Polish.
 The children do not speak Polish at home, but
 
often had heard it from older relatives.
 I do not know if
 
there were any families represented where neither parent
 
knew any Polish.
 I was given a few minutes at the end of
 
the younger class to ask the students why they were there.
 
The students answered freely, again in contrast to the much
 
quieter, more controlled students I spoke with at Pulaski
 
(who were also, however, older).
 
The students told me that their parents wanted them to
 
learn Polish, generally because there was a family member
 
who spoke Polish,  such as a grandmother or relatives in
 
Poland.
 One little boy mentioned that his grandmother was in
 
a nursing home and his father couldn't always go to see ncr,
 
so 1-
,
Le wan.-ca someone else to be able to visit her and
 
64
 
speak Polish.
 Another said that when relatives from Poland
 
came, or they went to v s -t, the Parents wanted tiem to know
 
the language.
 
In the second level English-speakjr
 class there were
 
two older studen-bs, around twelve perhaps, who had been in
 
the class for two or three years.
 A boy mentioned that he
 
i
laci been put in a Polish-speaking class before, but '
Lt was
 
too difficult and he hated it.
 Now both students were be nc
 
put into the Polish-speaking classes next year, and they were
 
looking forward to it,  although they weren't sure they would
 
be able to keep up.
 
;hen possible, the school tries to
 
transfer chi ldren into the Polish-speaking classes within
 
two years.
 
In the a ternoon we visited the kindergarten class,
 
taught by a young  (around 30), trained kindergarten teacher
 
recently arrived from Poland.
 She knew no English.
 The
 
class was not divided into specific time segments, but the
 
teacher obviously knew how to work within the attention span
 
of this age group  (generally four and five).
 She had a
 
variety of activities and kept the children moving from one
 
to another smoothly.
 The students drew; played games i
 
the middle of the floor  (including reciting poetry from
 
memory);  sat on the floor under the Polish alphabet and
 
worked on letter/sound recognition; played with American
 
toys (
blocks)  and Polish toys (
a Polish puzzle with scenes
 
of family life).
 The children were never out of control,
 
65
 
but
 em
.p:za is or
. quiet and staying in seats,  in evidence
 
in even the first grade classes, was not seen here.
 
The children also spoke Polish to the teacher, but :ncLisk
 
o each other.
 This may support what the teachers state,
 
that even cf
lilaren coming

and attends £arshal1 Law School in downto m C icago in une

 She grew up in South C1 cago,  a neign oriiooct on

close to zne steel mills.
 Her Lather wor::ed  n a  a ery,
 
and sent her to a parish school run by Felician Sisters.
 
Later she attended a Dominican high school in the South Snore
 
neighborhood, which was by then  (and remains now)  largely black.
 
She lives with her parents and younger brother  (also a
 
Polish school student)  in South Kolland,  a southern suburb
 
which has attracted many

Polish was spoken in her home,  and her grandmother, who

itkowski was thirteen,  spoke Polish
 
to them.
 But the Felician Sister

Since the r

 The little ones learned dancing,
 
games and singing.
 When I
IS.  t
litkowski was about seven, her
 
parents sent 1

Th s was about 1963,  ana ?u as 1 was uoca -ced lf
l t
ile H
T-
`
 
-y parish school building at Division and Cleaver.
 
Witkowski remembers learning to read and write
 
from books printed in Poland--some the same as her cousins
 
in Poland used.
 She started to learn stories in the second
 
grade,  and history and geography were introduced as regular
 
subj ects in the fifth grade  (as they are now).
 Everythinc
 
was condensed,  so -cna-c they could cover as mucn as possi le.
 
1

; A
. scnool,  however, became much more complex.
 History was
 
not  augnt separately, bu  most y  urougn
 uterature.
 
68
 
Teachers had to write and xerox materials.
 Students
 
were expected to memorize the lessons verbatim and be able
 
to recite them in class.
 But  1
s.  Jitkouski feels that this
 
teaching method was effective:
 "You learned the language."
 
She feels that her brother, eleven y e ars  younger and a secoa:d
 
year higl
a  scioo
 student at Pulaski,  is not get 
t ng as tho-
rough an education as she did, even with the same t
chers.
 
I
-e does not have to memorize everything;  instead he has '
Co
 
rephrase what he has read.
 
Since she was a year behind her regular school grade
 
in Polish school, i
is. Witkowski decided to push two years
 
together in her last year of high school,  in order to finis'-
both Polish school and parochial school in the same year.
 
That year s
i e studied up Uf
ltii Tnani sg v1ng on her own,
 
working on the material from the third year.
 This consisted
 
largely of historical novels,  such as Henry Sienkiewicz'
 
Quo Vadis, which she read whenever possible in English.
 At
 
Thanksgiving she took oral  examlnations with her teacner,
 
2
.
irs. Neumann, and the principal.
 She was very busy that year,
 
finishing her senior year in high school,  taking two years
 
o  Pol1s.i sc ool,  and working part-ti me.
 
Her fourth year of Polish high school covered mode-
-r
-
from 1913 to the present,  though they did
 
not get much beyond World War II.
 
:
is. Witkowski remembers that going to Polish school
 
was made a zam 1y outing,  especially when s ae  was younger.
 
After school was over, the family often ate lunch at a res-
taurant called the P0i
h Vi l
la, and had an outinc in
 
the Loop  (downtown Chicago).
 Later two other families
 
from their neigi
orhood sent children to Pulaski, and all
 
three families would go to the Prudential Building, or out
 
for ice cream.
 Later they car pooled.

'
Titkowski still
 
makes the trip tc Pulaski on Saturdays to bring her younge
 
bro t
her to school.
 
Very early she apparently learned that her parents really
 
wanted her to go to Polish school.
 She rement
hers bargaining,
 
in the second grade, for a go-go skirt and boots if she went
 
to Polish school.
 She didn't like it very much for the first
 
few years, but later she changed and became motivated.
 She
 
could not pin down a time or reason for this change.
 But
 
between sixth and seventh grades she visited Poland, and
 
that clinched her motivation.
 Now all this Polish stuff
 
wasn't just on paper--it was real people and real places.
 
She hated one of her early teachers, ,

 Now she appreciates the discipline the teacher
 
used, and is very close to her.

However, when i3.  Witkowski was put out of class,  she would
 
hide in the cafeteria.
 She felt that she "got away with
 
murder."
 In class,  they stood by their desks to answer
 
questions.

'itkowski felt that going to Polish school helped
 
counteract some of 1
--he negative things she p c ed up a ou:
 
e1ng Polish in t
u e general environment.
 In grade school
 
she spoJ e Pol ish, wore glasses and had "
_
-
-raids, when  t was
 
"not  'in'  to be ethnic."
 She had only one girlfriend who
 
was with her in Polish school and parish school too.
 She
 
didn't grow up in a particularly strong Polish neighborhood,
 
she felt.
 
Her
 high school was predominantly black.
 
There
 
was a lot of trading of ethnic slurs,  in a joking sort of
 
way, and she had black
 riends.
 
She is concerned about her brother  acing similar
 
negative stereotypes in the school he attends and the
 
neighborhood; he has had to deal with other kids calling
 
him "dumb Polack" and so forth.
 Even though it is more 'in
 
to be ethnic these days,  it would seem that older attitudes
 
change slowly.
 
iS.
 it owsk  has been active in other Po±isn organ1zat ons.
 
In high school she participated in a dance group  (again on
 
the near Northwest side, near Pulaski,  a long trip to make)
 
for a couple of years in her mid-teens.
 She is a member
 
of the Polish National Alliance,  the Polish Toraen's Alliance
 
and the Sea League of America.

iktor Barczyk was born in 1919 in the twon of
 
esowyce
 
an Sales a,  Poland.
 :
Iesowyce is a small industrial town
 
where coal mining is the main industry.
 Silesia has belonged
 
to both Austria and Poland at di ferent times over the last
 
700 years.
 kany Silesians are bilingual in German and Polish,
 
and 2
1r. 3arczyk grew up speaking both.
 Silesia was part of
 
Austria during the partitions o  Poland,  1795-1919, and
 
was returned to Poland about the time hr.  3arczvk was born.
 
r.  3arczyi  graduated  rom the Universaty a: Vienna wat.i
 
a degree in languages
 (Italaan and Latin).
 He also had a
 
background in Hebrew and Greek.
 He T

during World War II, and was evacuated to Great Britain
 
where the Polish Government in Exile was established.
 During
 
the war t h
e Polish Array fought with the British Array.
 
Barczyk picked up English and  became a liaison o

between the Polish and British forces.

Some div  icesof the Polish Army :ouc h-b on Italian and
 
African fronts.
 After the war, all divisions were demobilized
 
in England.
 The demobilization included a great many de
:-c
1ents.
 
:n Enoland, the Pol sh families lived in camps, where
 
schools were established for them.
 Hr. Barcz k took a
 
degree in education at
 
the
 
University of London,  coert
 
of the British government,  so that he could teach in British
 
SCnOOls.
 He taught in a British high school for one semester,
 
and then was requested to join the Polish i
uinistry of Educ-
ation
 
in England to kelp administer the Polish Schools.
 
hni e working for t he ?olisn L
ilnis-cry of Eaucaticn,  no
 
met his wife Zophia.
 She is from the Warsaw area, and had
 
been a head nurse at a large Warsaw hospital.
 Towards the
 
end of the war she was arrested and spent the last
 
the war in a concentration camp.
 After the war She
 
eventually came to England, and tried to use the time t
 
study.
 She and Wiktor met and married in London, where
 
their oldest daughter was born.
 
Eventually t
iie Barczyks took advantage of the British
 
o
er  (given to all British soldiers and extended to the
 
Polis  Army)  of transportation if they desired to relocate.
 
Tne Barczy s came to America, where hr. Barczy
 irst
 
went to i

 then tried work ng for t
.ie Polisa Cour er
  
newspaper in Hilwaukee.
 He didn't
- li a it,  and came to
 
Chicago.
 He applied at Honeywell Corporation for a
 's
 
job to keep him going while l
ie went to Northwestern University
 
for awhile.
 Honeywell instead hired him as an accountant
 
becausa o
:  his a  ar:anca as a ga

ent
 
to
 
Northwestern for two years though he did not obtain
 
another degree.  hr. Barczyk has now been with i
-
honeywell
 
for thirty years.
 
They have given him further training
 
in enginoerins and computer science and offered interesting
 
and well-paid work, most recently as a new product ievelc msnt
 
coordinator.
 Honeywell has also encouraged :
Ir. Barczyk
 
work, and in December of 1981 honored him with
 
a $500 award for his
 
volunteer services  (

 Then he
 
helped to organize a sc.aool at St. Stanislaus,  and served
 
as principal and teacher there.
 Again, he taught Polish to
 
English-speaking adults.
 But he soon had to quit because
 
his job required a lot of travel.

Instead, he became i n vol ve d  in administration and
 
curriculum development,  and helped write Pclska --

 He has written many supplementary materials on
 
Polish culture which he u s e s  in teaching adult evening classes

Helena Zioikowska is t1e President of the Polish Teachers
 
Association in America,  and t

.
..
 She gave generously of her time to n
.elp me under-
stand tne Polish schools and the people be h
ind tiera.
 
:
Ie ena Z ci owsi:a was corn if
l  193i in t
i e village o
 
Zaryts, naear Rabka,  in the Gorale region of Poland,  the
 
sout
.  central highlands.
 
Her father was a farmer, and she
 
was one of ten children.
 She graduated from Jacjellonian Un-
iversity  (one of Poland's most respected)  in Krakow,  in 195G,
 
and was a lecturer there for a few years before her marriage.
 
She holds the  l
aster's in Philology,
 
specializing in I
 
tics and dialectology;  she wrote her thesis on the dialect
 
of her own Rabka area.
 She is the only one of her famil
 
L
¼ I
 
attend t1e university,  though everyone else had some
 
sort of advanced training except the brother who took over
 
the farm.
 
After T
;orld
 
J
ar II the Polish borders were closed to
 
the West until 1956; when they opened,  'the flock of bachelors
 
from Chicago started to arrive."
 Her husband-to-be' s broth-
 
was married to her o w
n cousin, and decided to play matcbmaker
 
for l
-l
e ena.
 The prospective husband, Roman, took a boat
 
to Poland to meet her in 1959, met her at 5:00 P
hI and
 
proposed at 7:00 
 A
ll the next- morning.
 They were married a
 
few weehs later.
 The young couple retur ned to the U.S.
 
79
 
Their C
 idren were born in 1961 and 1962.
 :rs.
 ±olkowska
 
became a citi:en in 1964.
 
:
irs.  Z o1kowska happend to also have many other relatives
 
in  he
 since some branches of her family had immigrated
 
to the U.S.  at the turn of the centurr.
 She has an extended
 
family in :
Iinneapolis, and she says it is strange f
 h r
 
or  e 
v en sne vIsIts them because "they have Poi sh faces, but
 
they don '
 t speak Polish."
 She has one married
 
sister -
4.
-
-
'
-:
1
4  ca 0 ; the rest of her o r
n and her husband's families
 
are in Poland.
 
Zio1hovsha s chi dren both attended Polish school
 
as veil as parish school.
 Her daughter Anna finished ivr
 
junior year at Northwestern University in Evanston,  Illinois 7 
and son Daniel completed his sophomore year at the Universit:7
 
of Illinois/Champaign_urbana this year.
 Both left i
:
 
lately
 
after school was over to visit family in Polan
 
(Other Chicago Polish f a
milies will not travel to Poland at
 
this time.)
 
i
irs.
 i
k w k
s involvement with Polish Saturday
 
schools began in the early ±9GOTS wnen her children were
 
sma l, but sae wanted to do something w tn her tra ining.
 
She worked both as a full-time and substitute teacher in the
 
Polish schools, though this did not even pay for itself,
 
since she had to pay baby-sitters more than she earned.
 
After her children were older, i
irs.  Zlol:owska got
 
a 1
iaster's degree in Library Science f
1
from Rosary College,
 
a local Catholic coll ege
.  She then
 went
 to ,
,,
7
 ork f
for
 
the American Hospital Association, where she was a librarian
 
30
 
for seven years.
 She then took a four-month leave of absence
 
which stretched _
Jn -Co four years.
 She has packed those four
 
years with community service and vcitm ecr ac
 uL
 as .cr
 
the Polish co m
munity.
 
In her home Nrs.  Zio kowska has three desks, one for
 
each of her"jobs."
 One is for her Polish Teachers Association
 
work; another is for her work as financial secretary of her
 
Polish National Alliance lodge.
 She was involved with
 
the Polish Youth Association, the Polish Scouts, through
 
her daughter for many years.
 She sings
Polish choir
 
at her parish church,  St.  Ladislaus in Chicago.
 She has
 
also performed as a solo singer,  and cut a :ew records in
 
the 1960's,  including some dance music and C h
ristmas caro T
h.
 
Another of :
irs.  Ziolkowsha's interests is the Legion
 
of Young Polish Nomen, which raises money for charitable
 
causes
 y recru t ng "de:outantes"
 rom ?ol sn fama l
ios.
 
These young women raise money for the annual Legion event,
 
the Red and Nhite Bali, where they participate as debutantes.
 
The a
air raises quite respectable SU mS
 or tn
.e r charauaes,
 
as much as $20,000 a year.
 Some is given to hospitals,
 
some to the Polish Teachers Association,  and for many
 
years
 
the Legion also supported a professorship at the University
 
C.
" Chicago.
 Sometimes scholarships for women are awarded.
 
The Legion has helped the 2T \ by paying
 
for t
h e printing o
 
a textbook,  and donates about $2000 each year.
 
Nrs.  Zioikowska feels that since she got involved
 
w1
1  the Polish Teachers Asso
wit
-1
1
Iation as an aemin strator
 
in 1973,  she has been working full-time on a volunteer basis.
 
31
 
There are continual meetings with other administrators.
 
Ongoing proj
ects
 include textbook development,  even s
 
honoring individuals important to the schools  (they are
 
planning to honor Polish National Alliance President Aloysius
 
.
iakewski), the bi-annual poetry recitation contest, and
 
others.
 However,  she felt a real need to do this,  for
 
he felt that she was  wasting" her university training and
 
nills by not being involved.
 She felt an obligation to
 
ecome involved.
 However, with all her volunteer work,  she
 
:
as resisted donating her time to put the PT
 library in
 
.-der.
 She says this 13  too big a job and feels that the
 
PTZ
 should find the money far an honorarium  or a trained
 
person to do the work.
 
2
.
irs.  Ziolkowska is interested in all aspects of the
  
p01 4
 sh community in the Chicago area, as is evident in her
 
varied activities.
 As PTAA President for the past two years,
 
she has tried to update some of the workings of the organi-
zation to fit present needs of the Polish schools.
 
However, she intends to resign her positions with the
 
?T
 this summer and return to full-time work as a
 librarian.
 
She feels that she has given enough o  her pro: essicnel
 
skills on a volunteer basis to the community, and would
 
like some i
: nancia± compensation as we l
l as emotional satis-
faction for her work.

Zurczak did not retrain as a teacher in the U.S.
 He was 39

 This could be accor

The recognition component or tne project may aLso :ac l tate

Two or tnese stem primarily from money.
 First,  the sch ools

their classes.
 The solution which they presently have is
 
to use parish schools,  for the parishes are generally t

most sympazhet c  o tneir er:orts.
 Still, many paris1es have
 
not welcomed them, and schools sometimes feel that they
 
are 2C

 Teachers and pastor
 
may be sensitive about other groups using the ir ciassrooms,
 
creating tension.
 It would be ideal for the Polish schools
 
to have their own buildings, though this solution is probably

have been based on a great deal of personal sacrifice from
 
a relatively small group of educators.
 People involved in
 
this intense kind of volunteer work cannot keep it up forever.
 
Also, if American-trained education pro fes s io nal s  within the
 
Polish community become involved, it may--be more difficult
 
for them to justify totally volunteer service.

et there is a growing demand in government and business
 
for for
 language shills, a demand wn ch
 
graduates can help meet.
 
The Illinois Consultation on
 
a group which includes ethnic
 
ethnic school administrators,
 
schools and universities, and
 
Ethnicity
 
ethnic school
 
in Education,
 
community representatives,
 
educators from public and private
 
other interested people, has
 
helped to sponsor two initiatives aimed at meeting this need.
 
Both have failed.
 
One effort was to ootain formal accreditation through
 
the Illinois State Board of Education for "ethnic language,
 
Saturday and religiou
chools."
 The Board considered the
 
issue, but in 1979 decided to extenc
ecognition on1 7,
7 to
 
schools which meet at least five hours a day,  176 days per year.
 
However,  the Ill. Consultation on Ethnicity in Education
 
considered it a partial victory that the Board would even
 
consider tne issue.
 
The other effort was to mandate tests in school districts
 
throughout the state which would allow students to get high
 
school credit for foreign language knowledge t
iirough examina-
tion;  students would have been eligible for up to two years of-
credit.
 This program was based on a Chicago Board of Education
 
program already in place.
 (
For more detailed information on
 
this progr a
m,  see Philip Franchine's article -
in  merican Education.)
 
90
 
The  prograri is adminis ared by the Chicago Boarc
c
 
foreign Language Division, headed :
OV Edwin Cudecki.
 i
ir.
 
"bilingual"
 
Cudecki himself is a graduate of vpolish
 parish schools in
 
Chicago,  and recognized t
h e accomplishments of ethnic Saturda
 
schools.
 Through this program a student can receive one
 
year of  iigh  SC
OOi  foreign language credit through proficienc -
testinc.
 However, the student must then continue to study
 
the language one more year through tne :
llgn school.
 If t
 
student's school does not offer tae language,  the Board of
 
- ducat -on will supply a tutor.
 Thirty-three languages
 
are available;  the most frequently requested are Spanis
 
Polish, French, Assyrian and Korean.
 The proficiency tests
 
for these languages were provided in some instances
 
frc:
 
of charge by ethnic sc hools;  others were co u issioned
 
the Board.
 It is a heavy administ ra tive  load to carry these
 
tests, and the Board does not feel it could offer a second
 
year's credit testing on these grounds.
 
The bill to extend this program to the state was spon-
sored by Representative Hyron Kulas, a Ukrainian from Chicago,
 
and passed both the House and Senate only to be vetoed,
 
in September 1981, by Governor Thompson.
 The grounds for the
 
veto were that the bill would place another mandate on
 
local boards, and infringe "on a school board's authority
 
to establish graduation and course r
e a u i r e
m e
n t s ,
 which should
 
be established by each local board."
 
The ethnic schools have been v
e r:T
 disappointed at the
 
failure of these efforts.

SUGG:STIONS FOR  URTHER PE5:ARcI

Throughout the report I have indicated areas  ihich I
 
felt would bear more thorough investiration.
 were are
 
suriaarized some of the most important.
 
The first requirement for someone seriously interested
 
n looking at this school community is a  luent command o
 
Polish.
 School administrators,  teachers and parents either
 
speak little English or would probably prefer to speak Poli
 
Also, Polish is necessary for analyzing classwork and curriculum.
 
During this project only a few people in each "category'
 
could be contacted,  giving only an introduction to the
 
range of attitudes found within the Polish schools.
 A ques-
tionnaire could be a very appropriate method of gathering
 
a wide base of information and identifying the scope of
 
ISS UeS  involved.
 Questionnaires
. could be developed for the
 
following groups:
 PTAA administrators; principals;  school
 
board administrators;  parents;  teachers; high school stud nts;
 
grade school students.
 Questionnaires would probably be
 
better in Polish except for the students.
 Interviews could
 
then give more texture and depth to the issues identified
 
through the questionnaires.
 
The PTAA and schools were very happy to cooperate with
 
the project and would probably see several benefits to
 
further investigation.
 They appreciate receiving recogni-
tion from the general public for their years of hard work
 
more or less hidden within the Polish community.
 They also
 
92
 
would like more contacts with outside resources.  Further
 
study of the schools might also result in art
s on their
 
v
ior  written in Eng f
lsn, while they tnemse ves have concen-
trated on writing textbooks and a few short historical articles,
 
in Polish.
 Statistics on some issues which they have not
 
kept records on might also prove enlightening to the PTAA.
 
Follow-up interviews should
 
cross-section of types
 
but of the generations
 
the recent immigrants,
 
of people
 
involved:
 
include not only a wide
 
involved with the schools
 
the post-war/founders,
 
and American-born.
 I suggest trying
 
to meet with individuals and families away from the school,
 
where time is usually very short.
 
For further investigation o  t
ile early bilingual p0 7ish
 
parochial schools, a potentially fascinating but comp]-e:,
-
topic, there is extensive literature on the development
 
of the Catholic Church in Chicago  (
the U.S.'  largest Arch-
diocese), including the ethnic parish policies of the Arch-
diocese.
 Records of parish schools are probably available
 
in parishes or local archives.
 Josepli Parot has an
 
excellent bibliographical section including manuscript and
 
archive holdings in Polish Catholics in Chicago.
 
There are also, fortunately, still many individuals
 
alive who were students and/or teachers in t
h e Polish
 
parochial schools.
 The last generation:to  raduaté from these
 
schools is now in their 40's and 50's; and older folks who
 
attended the schools a generation earlier are also still
 
93
 
alive.
 There are even some very o d nuns,  in their SO's
 
and 90 1s, who taught in the schools still living.
 
In examining the history of Polish schools and Polish
 
education in Chicago,  it is 1nterest ng to note tnat  nsre
 
is not a complete break between the Polish parish SCJIO O I
 
"system" and the Saturday schools.
 Individuals from the
 
two schools have interacted in significant ways affecting
 
the Saturday schools.
 Further investigation should look
 
at the influence of the Polish parish schools on the
 
priests/graduates of the system who now rent to the Saturday
 
schools.
 The PTAA mentioned several times that much depends
 
on the goodwill of parish priests in maintaining their
 
schools in affordable locations.
 What is the background
 
of priests who are sympathetic and priests who are not,
 
and how do their attitudes reflect earlier experiences in
 
the Polish parish schools?
 
Furthermore, although there is a relatively low per-
centage of "English-speaking classes" in the PTAA system
 
at this time, and there has been no outreach to this popu-
lation, the first textbook which the PTAA felt necessary to
 
develop was Polska Mowa. 
Polska Mowa is for older students
 
who are beginning Polish language study.
 Mr.  Barczyk spoke
 
of teaching older English-speaking classes in the mid-60's
 
so there was an interest and need then, which was addressed
 
by the Polish schools.
 What has been the history of classes
 
for English-speaking students within the Polish Saturday schools?
 
94
 
The theme o  inter-generational tension between members
 
of different "waves of immigration" has appeared several
 
times in this report.
 I feel that the issue is basic not
 
only to understanding the history and development of Polish
 
education in the U.S.,  but to many other issues of ethnic
 
life within communities who share this pattern of successive
 
waves of immigration separated by time.
 
These tensions come to the fore especially when demo-
graphic changes occur.
 Such a demographic change is taking
 
place within the Polish schools now, as the children of the
 
founding generation begin to graduate.
 Hore recent immi-
grants, and perhaps American-born, parents are participating
 
in the schools.
 The viewpoints of each of these groups,  as
 
well as the range of attitudes found within each group,
 
should be looked at.
 
The question:of attitudes on the part of "Americans
 
of Polish descent"  (a common term within the Chicago Polish
 
community)  is particularly complex.
 Are American-born
 
parents who are currently sending their children to Polish
 
school primarily those who themselves grew up with some
 
knowledge of Polish, but due to "mixed marriages" or somc
 
other reason have not taught the children?
 Has the "eth::
 
revival" of the 1970's had any effect in counteracting the
 
rejection of ethnic identification which man f
ramiiies went
 
through for so manyyears
 Has the election of a Polish Pope
 
and the Solidarity movement encouraged second,  third or
 
fourth-generation Polish families to "reclaim their Polis m ss?'1
 
95
 
It is possible, too, that various efforts in "Polish
 
education" from different segments in the community might
 
consider combining forces in the future.
 I recently dis-
covered that a community group of Americans of Polish descent
 
has presented a proposal to the Archdiocese of Chicago for
 
a "Polish magnet school" within the Chicago parochial schools.
 
This group seemed to
. be aware of the Saturday schools, but
 
felt that goals were different.
 If their proposal is no:
.
 
accepted by the Archdiocese, working with the Saturday schoolz
 
might be an alternative.
 
According to Helena Ziolkowska, the Polish  claim a
 
population of three-quarters of a million, both Polish-born
 
and of Polish-descent, in the Chicago area.
 She estimated
 
that about one-third of that number might be children and
 
young people, about 250,000.
 The Polish Saturday schools
 
have 3
,000 students enrolled.
 So according to her very rough
 
estimate, only a small fraction of the "Polish" population
 
is involved in the Polish schools.
 
A necessary corollary to finding out who is involved
 
in ethnic community affairs and why, is examining who is not
 
involved.
 Unfortunately, this is much more difficult, and
 
a methodology has not yet been developed.
 that are the
 
real numbers and motivations involved?  None of the statis-
tics now kept enable us to address these questions, since
 
they focus on last name,  second language spoken in the home,
 
or ethnic organization affiliation.
 All of these are unrel-
iable indicators of strength of ethnic identification.
 
96
 
A fe w  other issues of interest which have o n ly  been
 
mentioned in the report include:
 
--the international network of Polish schools outside
 
Poland, both in English-speaking countries  (U.S., Canada,
 
England, Australia)  and others such as Argentina.
 
--what roles are played in the Polish
 
community by the
 
various organizations such as the Polish National Alliance,
 
the Polish Roman Catholic Union,  and the Polish American
 
Congress,  and what ties the Polish schools have with
 
these organizations.
 
--why efforts to obtain some hind of main-stream recognition
 
for the ethnic schools in Illinois have proved not yet
 
oolitically viable,  and have failed.

ducation).
 The Polish community supports
 
not just one school b
ut a network of f
ifteen which serves students i
n many
 
areas of Polish settlement throughout t
he sprawling Chicago metropolitan area.
 
The schools are coordinated by an umbrella organization of professional Polish
 
educators, the Polish Teachers Association i
n America,  i
nc.  Three other schools
 
i
n other p
arts of t
he country are offshoots of t
he Polish Teachers Association's
 
work.
 
These schools are generally referred to i
n E
nglish as Polish L

Schools or Polish Saturday Schools.  A

luently, and have a
 
command of t

These schools were e
stablished i
n t
he early 1
950's by Polish r
efugees
 
who chose not to return to Communist Poland after World War 1
1.
 However,
 
ethnic e
ducation was a concern i
n C
hicago l
ong before, and t
here existed
 
f
or many years a k
ind of Polish education system w
ithin the p
arochial  schools
 
of Polish p
arishes.
 These schools were not t
he forerunners of t
oday's
 
Saturday schools, for t
hey were established for another generation of young
 
people.
 B
ut a brief consideration of t
he parochial  schools sheds some l
ight
 
on changing attitudes t
oward ethnic e
ducation w
ithin t
he Polish community.
 
BEFORE THE POLISH TEACHERS ASSOCIATION:
 The Polish P
arochial  S
chools
 
For a majority of Poles, being Polish has h
istorically meant being
 
Catholic.  After Poland was d
ivided up among Russia, Prussia and Austria
 
i
n 1
795, Poles c
lung to religion as an i
mportant ethnic marker.  When t
housands
 
of Poles i
mmigrated to Chicago i
n t
he l
ate 1
800's, they sought to establish
 
p
arishes which were Polish i
n character.
 Many churches were b
uilt, and with
 
t
hem schools were established.
Footnote:
 There were two types of "Polish
 
p
arishes."  Some were r
un by Polish religious orders, notably t
he Resurrectionis
 
F
athers and the Felician S
isters.
 There were a
lso Polish p
arishes under the
 
d
irect jurisdiction of t
he Archdiocese.
 This development r
eflected a split
 
i
n community t
hinking:  was i
t most i
mportant to be Catholic and t
hen Polish?
 
Or were Polish nationality and Catholicism i
nextricably i
ntertwined?  Parot, 1981.
 
The Resurrectionists and Felicians are still active i
n some of C
hicago's most
 
prominent Catholic schools.) /
 
I
n t
hese parish schools, many of which had only students from Polish-
speaking homes, Polish l
anguage was part of the curriculum.
 I
n t
he absence of
 
central d
irection of t
he curriculum, each school was free to set i
ts own use
 
of or i

 Therefore schools seem t

The post-war refugees were often educated professionals, who spoke a
 
contemporary l

 A

hese factors contributed to
 
d
ifferences between Americans of Polish descent (
note: a frequent t

To a great extent, too, World War 1

 The founders of the
 
Polish Teachers Association i

who are c
urrently active i
n t

children i

found t
hemselves  i

t
he Polish Army was demobilized i

I
n both German and E
nglish camps schools were set up by Polish teachers.
 
I
n Germany, t
he premise of the schools was that t
he children would be returning
 
to Poland, a

Many teachers who worked in these camp schools later became involved
 
in establishing Polish Saturday schools in the countries where they
 
eventually settled:
 the U.S., England, Canada, Australia, and Argentina.
 
These camp schools may also have directly provided models for the early
 
Saturday schools;  even Polish teachers' organizations formed in the camps
 
were models for later groups.
 
Many Poles made their way to the United States when the Displaced
 
Persons Commission of Congress opened the way in 1948.
 Thousands settled
 
in Chicago during the late 1940's and 1950's.
 They found in Chicago
 
many existing Polish churches, and other social and fraternal organizations
 
which met some of their needs.
 And since many families with children were
 
among them, they sent their children to Polish parochial schools, like the
 
earlier immigrants.
 But they also felt a need for a supplementary kind of
 
Polish education which did not already exist in Chicago.
 
Why did the existing parochial schools not fully meet their needs?
 
Language seems to have been a central concern.
 The newly-arrived immigrants
 
wanted their Polish-speaking children to become literate in the contemporary
 
Polish language.
 But the American-born teachers in the Polish parochial
 
schools did not speak modern Polish.
 One post-war immigrant said that the
 
American Polish gram mar and archaic words sometimes make her "wince."  This was
 
partly a result of the informal nature of the use of Polish language in
 
parochial schools curricula.
 
Ano4-t e( important need for the new immigrants was rooted in the cir-
cumstances under which they  emigrated.
 They were political refugees, not
 
the economic immigra'js of the earlier generations.  Early immigrants, too,
 
came from a divided Poland, and thought of themselves as "Russian Poles,"
 
or "Austrian Poles;" nationalism was not a strongly developed concept among
 
them.
 The post-war arrivals felt a strong bond of patriotism to Poland,
 
so briefly united as an independent nation between the wars, a bond reinforced
 
by the fact that they could not return.
 They wanted their children to
 
understand their feelings about Poland and being Polish.
 To accomplish
 
this goal,  schools of a new sort were necessary,  schools where their children
 
could learn contemporary Polish language and history,  taught by the trained
 
professional
 teachers among them.

Formation of the Polish Teachers Association in America,  Inc.  
During the 1950's,  the new in-i
r
nigran
kept largely to themselves as they
 
thrashed out directions for the Polish education of their children.  Various
 
activities such as lecture series began almost at once.
 Teachers first
 
gravitated to each other on a social basis and eventually established
 
working organizations.
 The first such seems to have been the "Circle
 
of Polish Teachers and Graduates Abroad"  (in Polish,
 
The Circle began offering classes in
 
Polish language and history about 1952; these classes eventually evolved
 
into General Casimir Pulaski Polish School.
 
Several educational organizations formed and reformed before consolidating,
 
in 1962,  into the Polish Teachers Association in America,  Inc.,  incorporated
 
as a not-for-profit orgnaization in the state of Illinois.
 A stable
 
working organization thus emerged, although the Polish Teachers Association
 
formally counts its beginnings from 1953  (footnote:
 according to the Silver
 
Jubilee Souvenir Book, 1978).
 
THE WORK OF THE POLISH TEACHERS ASSOCIATION
 
The Polish Teachers Association (hereafter referred to as the PTAA)
 
is a professional organization whose membership is open to all teachers born
 
and educated in Poland, as well as foreign-born teachers of Polish language.
 
The PTAA provides a network of guidance and services to fifteen Polish
 
Saturday schools in the Chicago metropolitan area, and three in other
 
parts of the country (note: list will be appended).  The Chicago area
 
schools alone serve more than three thousand students and over 120 teachers.
 
Each school in the network is administratively independent, but most
 
follow the extensive curriculum guidelines which have been developed by
 
the PTAA.
 These guidelines were developed in order to standardize and
 
thereby upgrade the education students were receiving in the Polish schools,
 
as the number of schools grew rapidly during the 1970's.
 
The main goal of the PTAA is to propagate the Polish language.
 In support
 
of this goal, the organization supports Saturday schools and assists in
 
starting new ones.
 The PTAA develops curriculum materials for use in the
 
schools,
 - 
7
 
There are also several types of related activities sponsored by the PTAA.
 
Most notable are contests stressing achievement in the Polish language.
 
In the 1960's, two essay contests were held.
 During the 1970's,  semi-annual
 
poetry recitation contests were begun which attract enthusiastic participation
 
from Polish Saturday  schools, public and private high school Polish classes,
 
and area colleges which teach Polish.
 (
Footnote:
 In 1982
., about
 co
 
students participated.)
 
The PTAA cooperates with similar teachers' oragnizations in Canada and
 
in England,  including exchanges of reports and textbooks.
 
As a Polish organization, the PTAA cooperates with a variety of other
 
Chicago-area Polish institutions,  such as the Polish American Congress,
 
Polish Scouts, Polish National Alliance, Polish Roman Catholic Union,
 
and the Legion of Young

PTAA SCHOOLS
 
There are currently fifteen Polish Language Schools in the Chicago area
 
affiliated with the PTAA.
 Two are older, established schools; Pulaski and
 
Kosciuszko Schools are both about thirty years old.
 Others are very new,
 
for six of the fifteen have opened within the last five years.
 Three other
 
schools have opened with PTAA consultation in Minnesota, Houston, Texas,
 
and Worcester, Massachusetts (the latter beginning with the 1982-83 school year)
 
The original center of Polish settlement in Chicago was located on the
 
near northwest side of Chicago, at Division, Milwaukee and Ashland Boulevards
 
8
 
the so-called Polish Triangle
 Early Polish language school activities
 
were also held in this area.
 Kosciuszko and Pulaski schools both met in the
 
vicinity, and until the 1
970s were the main Polish Saturday schools.  However,
 
this neighborhood was fundamentally changed by the building of the John F,
 
Kennedy Expressway through the area,  With great difficult Chicago Polonia
 
saved the two oldest Chicago Polish churches, both magnificent buildings,
 
from being razed, but the character of the neighborhood did not survive.. Low-
income housing was built, and Polish residents began to move out.
 The neigh-
borhood •
is now primarily Hispanic, although many
. Polish churches and other
 
organizations remain there.  New immigrants from Poland also settle there ) 
but generall  move out as they become economically established.
 
As families moved out of the old neighborhood, it became increasingly
 
difficult for students to return to the neighborhood to attend Saturday school,
 
Some families had reservations about how safe
 
dropped
 
The significant numbers of Polish families settling in new communities,
 
mostly far northwest Chicago neighborhoods and suburbs on the northwest and
 
west sides of the city, made the founding of new Polish schools feasible.
 
In the late 1
960s schools were established in Hammond, Indiana (
just across
 
the Indiana-Illinois state line from Chicago), and in Cicero, Illinois,
 
a near west suburb of the city.
 Nine new schools were opened during the
 
1
970s, and since 1
980 two new Chicago-area schools have opened and three
 
in other parts of the country,.
 
In 1
980, total enrollment in the PTAA schools was around 2000 students.
 
In 1
981-82 enrollment had increased to 3000.  Part of this growth can prob-
ably be attributed to the steady growth of the newer, smaller schools.
 PTAA
 
administrators suggested two other factors as well:
 the election of the
 
'"
44
 
Polish Pope; and the new visibility of the Solidarity effort in PolarldV'the
 
9
 
and artists; Maria Konopnicka School commemorates a much-loved Poetj
 
Maksymilian  and Pope John Paul II are definitely
. Polish in symbolism
 
worldwide public support and sympathy which has resulted.
 
The administrators felt that these positive factors helped to
 
counteract negative, stereotypes of Polishness, especially as embodied in
 
Polish jokes and the image of  the "dumb Polack."  These stereotypes
 
and generally negative feelings about being Polish, they felt, prevent
 
Poles and Americans of Polish descent from participating in the Polis
 
schools.
 
However, the schools have no hard data on why their enrollment has
 
increased.
 Increased immigration of young parents from Poland may also be a
 
factor.  The reasons why families are sending their children to these schools
 
in record numbers are not yet fully understood.
 
The names chosen for the Polish Saturday schools underscore the independent,
 
national orientation of the schools.  All are named for famous Poles.
 
The two earliest schools were named for the first well-known Polish Americans,
 
Revolutionary War soldiers General Casimir Pulaski and General Thaddeus
 
Kosciuszko,
,  Other schools  are named after figures '
famous from World War II
 
such as recently-canonized St. Maksymilian Kolbe and General Anders.
 Copernicus,
 
Paderewski, Sienkiewicz, and Chopin Schools are named for well-known scientists
 
St.
 
rather  than religious
 - there are no schools named for other saints or popes.
 
PTAA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION
 
Each PTAA school maintains its own independent school administration.
 
The PTAA provides only educational services plus whatever organizational
 
suggestions may be requested by the school, or by parents  who are organizing
 
a new school.

Each school is individual in th —type of organizational affili a ti ons  
j
r  
rrangements it has with the parish housing it; how much rent is
 
paid; how teachers are paid; what the Board struct ure is;  an d so  forth.
 
With fifteen schools the arrangements are quite diverse.
 
Teachers are paid from six to eight dollars an hour.
 This often depends
 
on the location of the school and the kinds of families involved.  Established
 
suburban professional families may be able to 
fe d' 
support their schools
 
more generously than a school with many recent immigrant families still
 
struggling to establish themselves.
 Rents also vary, depending on the parish.
 
Almost all the schools use parish school buildings, although most .
do ñot have
 
a formal affiliation with the parish.
 
(Footnote:  An unusual example of a close organizational affiliation with
 
a Polish fraternal society is Maria Konopnicka School.
 Konopnicka is
 
currently the largest PTAA school, with 500 students in 1981-82, and is located
 
n the Five Holy Martyrs Parish, seat of the (Polish) Bishop Alfred Abramowicz.
 
The school has affiliated with the Polish Roman Catholic Union, which requires
 
that all families in the school belong to the Union.
 Because the PRCU supports
 
and books are provided for free;
 
the school, tuition is only  25 per year"  yet the school was able to spend
 
%6000 on fieldtrips in 1
981, which other schools cannot afford. )
 
Some PTAA schools have affiliated with the Polish National Alliance,
 
another fraternal organization.
 The PNA does not insist that all families
 
in the school belong  but a core of 25 families must first form a lodge.
 
Then the PNA contributes $5.00 per child/lodge member to the school.
 Emilia
 
Plater School in Mount Prospect,, -
-Illinois, John Paul II School in Lombard,
 
Illinois, and Kazimierz  Wielki in Hammond, Indiana are among PNA affiliate
 
schools.
 
Most PTAA schools prefer not to affiliate with another organization
 
which might try to  exercise some control over school affairs.

TEACHERS IN THE PT A SYSTEM
 
Currently ninety percent of the teachers in the PTAA schools are
 
Polish-born and Polish-educated.  Many  attended both pedagogical high school
 
and teachers! .
- college in Poland; others hold advanced degrees from Polish
 
universities.
 PTAA administrators explained that in Poland, teachers are
 
highly respected and proud of their profession.  However,  teaching is poorly
 
paid and teachers generally continue teaching careers because they enjoy their
 
work.
 
There are about 1
20 teachers in the Chicago-area Polish schools.
 The
 
continue the tradition of low pay for teaching; after gas and childcare
 
expenses are taken into consideration, many have almost nothing left from
 
their small salaries.
 (Note: Helena Ziolkowska related how, during the
 
1
960s, she received $6 per day as a Polish school teacher--and paid her
 
babysitter $
10.)
 They also manage to find the time to grade papers and
 
prepare lessons.
 Obviously these individuals have a strong commitment to
 
the schools.
 
Several reasons motivate teachers.  Many find that this is their only
 
professional outlet in the United States.
 Some must take manual labor job
 
to support themselves and are unable to retrain to teach in American schools.
 
But they miss the satisfactions of their profession.
 It is hard to no longer
 
work in a respected profession, and self-respect suffers.
 Some teachers
 
say that '
!
they only feel like people on Saturdays."
 
Others feel strongly
 
that they should not waste specialized training and talents.
 Some younger
 
women at home with small children find Saturday school a convenient part-time
 
job.
 
Teachers range in age from 25 to 70.
 Experience in the Saturday schools
 
ranges from newcomers to 25 years.
 The many younger Polish teachers who have
 
immigrated in recent years help to keep the most contemporary Polish language
 
.
1
2
 
in the schools, since teachers who immigrated after World War II are by now
 
out of touch with changes in the language in Poland over the last thirty
. years.
 
There are a few teachers who are also native speakers of English, who
 
immigrated as  young children or were born in the U.S.  These teachers often
 
hold American credentials and teach in public schools as well.
 In Polish
 
schools they teach the "English-speaking" classes.
 (Footnote:  Classes for
 
"English-speaking"children make up only
, 1
0-15-per cent of the Saturday school
 
classes.  PTAA administrators say that this is due in part to a lack of
 
qualified teachers fluent in both English and Polish.  The PTAA depends on
 
Polish-born teachers; even Saturday school graduates are not considered
 
fluent enough in Polish to be able to teach the higher grades, though some
 
do teach beginning levels.)
 
The PTAA is very concerned with upholding standards within their schools.
 
When a teacher indicates interest in teaching in the Saturday schools,  the
 
PTAA will verif  the teaching credential and put the teacher on a waiting list.
 
To aid their teachers  the PTAA also sponsors teacher training and in-service
 
seminars.  The Association has also co-sponsored courses which helped some
 
of their teachers gain an American teaching credential.
 
CURRICULUM
 
-
 Ethnic schools have unique curriculum needs.
 Language and other texts
 
developed for use in the home country do not relate to the experience of
 
children growing up in the U.S.; while books developed for students with no
 
knowledge of a language are inappropriate for children who speak the language
 
at home.  Thus ethnic schools are forced to adapt books which are not suited
 
to their needs, or to write new ones.
 
For many years  Polish school teachers relied primarily on their own
 
libraries and ability to gather and develop their own materials.
 (Note: An
 
outstanding example of this effort is Pulaski high school teacher Maria Neumann,
 
who has filled five floor - to-ceiling cabinets with books --Polish dictionaries,
 
1
3
 
encyclopedias, history  art history, literature and so forth--all donated,
 
begged or bought over the years.
 
However 1 in the mid-1960s the PTAA realized that there was a need for
 
specially-developed texts to relieve somewhat the strain on their teachers.
 
The first major effort, written by a team of teachers, was Polska Nowa
  
(The Polish Language a two-volume introduction to Polish language for older
 
children or adults with no knowledge of Polish.
 A teacher!s manual, in Polish,
 
accompanies the book.
 
Polska Mowa has proven extremely popular.
 Now in its eighth edition,
 
80,000 copies have been sold.
 It is used not on1,j in Polish Saturday schools
 
in the U.S., Canada, England,  cnd Australia, but in colleges and high schools
 
which teach Polish language.
 
For the most part, however, there simply is not enough manpower or money
 
available for the schools to develop needed materials, so they adapt
 
from already available books.  Both history books and language readers have
 
been put together in this way.
 
History is
 a particularly sensitive subject.
 Some parents have
 
objected to the presentation of Polish history found in some books published
 
in Poland, which they felt contained t
tC O
U
f
list  propaganda."  So a four-
volume History of Poland was developed by the PTAA  for use in Polish-
speaking classes, grades  five through eight.  For the English-speaking classes,
 
the PTAA obtained the use of a booklet written in Chicago as part of the
 
celebration of the Polish millenium in 1
966.
 
Some textbooks are obtained from Polish teachers', groups in England
 
and Canada  where text development is also on-going.
 Some texts from Poland
 
are also used.
 This is particularly true in the high school classes  which use

With the opening of many new  Polish schools in the 1
970s, the PTAA began
 
to see the need for a standardized  curriculum as well.
 This would both aid
 
teachers and let students move more easily between schools if they needed to.
 
Also students! education would not rely so heavily on the resourcefulness of
 
the individual teacher.
 
In 1
975 an Education Committee was formed to develop curriculum guidelines
 
and oversee textbook development.
 The Education Committee formalized an outline
 
of the types of classes to be offered through the Polish language schools.
 
These included:
-
kindergarten
 
8 years of elementary school for Polish-speaking children
 
4 years of high school for Polish-speaking children
 
classes for children who do not speak Polish
 
singing, music, dance and theater program
 
The Polish schools differentiate in their class organization between
 
children who come from Polish-speaking homes with some fluency in Polish
 
(though command of the language varies widely) and those who come knowing no
 
Polish at all.
 However, the schools were founded to serve students from
 
Polish-speaking homes, and the main thrust of the schools remains to teach
 
in Polish.  Children who do not speak Polish are "mainstreamed" into
 
Polish-speaking classrooms as soon as their language ability permits.  For this
 
reason, too, no long-term English-speaking curriculum has been developed.
 
(Note?:
 Classes for children from Polish-speaking homes are designated
 
"Polish-speaking" while those for children with no prior knowledge are termed
 
"English-speaking",  Of course, children in "Polish-speaking" classes usually
 
speak English as well. )

For the Polish-speaking classes ) the Education Committee has developed
 
an extensive curriculum plan for each year of the elementary grades
 
1
-8, in Polish language, history and geography.
 The guide suggests lesson
 
plans for each Saturday of the school year.
 
The Curriculum Plan also includes instruction in singing, music, dance
 
and theater.
 In practice  what is available in any given school depends
 
on what teachers are available.
 In addition these subjects are not mandatory and
 
students must give an extra hour each Saturday in order to participate.
 
Activities include, at various schools, drama club, choir, dance groups,
 
poetry recitation and the like.
 
Teachers feel that these "extracurricular activities" help to keep
 
students interested in attending Saturday school,
 since these activities
 
are fun while the regular classes can be a drudge.  Language skills and other
 
academic subjects are considered to be the main focus of Polish school;
 
the "fun" things may be a "carrot" for some of the students.
 - 
(Note:  These attitudes are an interesting contrast to some second-
and third-generation ethnic groups who do not emphasize language learning
 
but express ethnic education through encouraging their children to participate
 
in activities such as dance groups and choirs.)

Two schools were visited as part of this study, in order to observe
 
most of the elements of the PTAA "umbrella" curriculum plan.  Descriptions
 
of their operation will serve as examples of how Polish schools actually
 
function.
 
GENERAL CASIMIR PULASKI SCHOOL
 
Polska sko a ir
n. Gen. Kazimierza Pulaskiegp, or the General Casimir
 
Pulaski Polish School, is the oldestPolish Saturday school in the Chicago area.
 
Currently the school uses the St. Wenceslaus Roman Catholic parish school
 
building located at 3435 N. Lawndale, in1Chicago.
 
Pulaski School marks its beginnings from 1
951, but for the early years
 
the history of the school and the PTAA are nearly synonymous.  Originally
 
classes were sponsored by the Pedagogical Section of the Circle of Polish Teachers
 
and Graduates Abroad.  The first class had 32 students.
 
Pulaski School met in various locations in the Polish Triangle area from
 
the early 5O's to 1
978, when it moved to St. Wenceslaus.
 Its longest residence
 
was at the parish school of Holy Trinity, one of the oldest Polish Catholic
 
churches in Chicago, where classes were held from 1
960 to 1978.  The school
 
grew rapidly.  There were 200 students in 1
955, 850 students in 1
961 (when
 
high school classes formed), and 1000 students in 1
970.
 In 1
981-82, 350
 
students were enrolled.
 
Pulaski offers grades 1-8 and four years of high school for Polish-
speaking children only.
 (Footnote:  Of the fifteen Polish language schools,
 
only four have high school  classes.)
 
The parish school hall in the basement of the building is used by
 
Pulaski for school assemblies and parents> waiting room; the classrooms are
 
on two upper floors.
 On a regular Saturday school day,  there are usually
 
several parents in the hail, helping with school business, visiting or
 
reading the paper.
 Coffee and home-made pastries are available.

There are ten classes in session both before and after noon.  Grades
 
1-8 each meet in two sections, while two of the high school classes meet
 
before noon, and two in the afternoon.
 Students who participate in the
 
extracurricular activities either stay late or come earlier than their
 
class session.
 
The professed goal of the school is to teach the Polish language.
 
To this end, all  grades stress language skills.  All classes are conducted
 
entirely in Polish.
 In the primary grades,  1-3, reading and writing
 
are the main subjects (note: as in Poland, children are never taught to
 
print; they learn to write script immediately),
 Some Polish history and
 
traditions
 
the class.
 
literature
 
are introduced, but mainly through legends and stories told to
 
In the intermediate grades, Polish language skills are continued,
 
introduced, and Polish history and geography as separate
 
subjects are included.
 The high school grades stress the study of
 
Polish literature and history.
 
Although
: ail thé students speak some Polish, command of the language
 
varies greatly.
 Everyone admits that the students are all most comfortable
 
in English.  The first-grade teacher felt that she essentially presents
 
Polish as a second language.
 If a student persists with Polish studies,
 
however, and graduates from Polish high school, he or she is expected to
 
have a fluent knowledge of spoken and written Polish and also be able to
 
write well.  The high school classes cover high school level material in
 
Polish.  The school is particularly proud of its high school graduates.
 
What the students actually retain from their Polish school experience
 
may be different from what the school hopes to achieve.  A graduate of
 
Pulaski in the early 1
970s felt,  ten years later, that her fluent working
 
knowledge of Polish language was not the most important thing she had gained.
 
More important for her was learning something about Polish history and
 
1
8
 
traditions which counteracted negative stereotypes about being Polish,
 
giving her pride in her family and background and the self-confidence to
 
accept all parts of her life.
 
One theme noted in all the classrooms at Pulaski, and mentioned
 
as well by parents and teachers, was "discipline."  This meant that
 
classes are quiet, that students stand by their seats to give their
 
responses.
 In Polish and other European educational systems,  a certain
 
distance between teacher and students is traditionally part of how students
 
express respect for the teacher.  This tradition is, ideally, maintained
 
at Pulaski.  However, teachers were affectionate with the youngest  and
 
cordial with older students.
 
(Footnote:
 PTAA administrators mentioned that Polish-trained teachers
 
sometimes needed to adapt teaching styles  somewhat for their American-
raised students.
 However, the question of teaching style  and the concept
 
of discipline in the classroom is- very slippery  and difficult to define).
 
Teachers at Pulaski range from young, recent arrivals from Poland
 
to Mrs. 2urczak, wife of the principal, who recently celebrated her fiftieth
 
year in teaching, including many years in the Polish Saturday schools.
 Only
 
the first grade teacher, Mrs.
 ,  holds both Polish and American
 
teaching credentials.  One of the high school teachers, Dr. Janina Kras,
 
holds the Ph.D. from Jagellonian University, Poland!s oldest and most-
respected institution of higher education.

P
ULASKI PARENTS
 
Parents are the core of t
he Polish schools.
 Their need f
or t
hem
 
and
 
f
uels t
he organizing of new schools "the dedication to bringing c
hildren
 
every S
aturday.
 
The main concern of t
he rM' a r
ents
 
was t
hat t
heir Polish-speaking children become l
iterate i
n Polish.  They felt
 
t
hat a formal educational environment would be better than t
rying t
o teach t
hese
 
subjects a
t home.
 A
lso i
mportant was formal education i
n Polish h
istory and
 
cu  t
ure.
 
The relative i
mportance of t
hese f
actors, however, probably varies
 
from f
amily to f
amily.
 The commitment t
o speaking Polish at home, a
nd to
 
helping s
tudents with Polish school homework a
lso varies.
 
Post-war i
mmigrants a
lso perceive t
he attitucks
 of t
he more r
ecent
 
i
mmigrants  towards Polish education t
o be very d
ifferent from t
heir own.
 
A
lthough many newly-arrived f
amilies do send t
heir children to P
olish school,
 
many do not.
 Helen Z
iolkowska expressed i
t this way:
 
People who came to t
his country from Europe i
n early '14
0's and '
50's
 
were survivors of World War I
t, and t
hey were very patriotic.  And to them
 
survival meant to be Polish and to keep the Polish l
anguage and f
aith and
 
t
raditions.. Jf these people were able t
o t
ransfer t
heir motivations and feelings
 
to t
he next generation, then t
hese children have children now and t
hey send
 
t
hem to Polish schools.
 But not a
ll of t
hem succeeded.
 Some of t
he children
 
went to Polish schools because they had to, and once they got married, some-
t
imes to people of d
ifferent nationality, they d
idn't pay that much attention..
 
B
ut people who come from Poland r
ight now are of d
ifferent stock.
 Thirty
 
years of Communist i
nfiltration d
id t
he job.  Many of them don't f
eel  that
 
t
hey should keep the Polish t
radition.
 Not everybody but quite a b
ig percen-
t
age assimilates very quickly.
 They don't talk Polish at hom'..tt's very sad..
 
I
 don't feel sorry for t
hem,  I feel sorry for t
heir children because t
hey end
 
20
 
not k
nowing anything about t
hemselves.''
 
A
lso, as Mrs. Z
iolkowska points out, there i
s a new group of potential
 
Polish school parents appearing--Polish school graduates who are e
stablishing
 
t
heir own f
ami I
 i
es.
 It was noted t
hat several marriages have even r
esulted
 
f
rom acquaintance i
n Polish school.
 
I
nevitably, as t
he post-war i
mmigrants' children f
inish h
igh school
 
(
the youngest of these children are mostly i
n h
igh school a
lready), t
he demo-
graphic makeup of t
he Polish schools w
ill change.  More recent Polish i
mmi-
grants and f
amilies who are American of Polish descent w111 1be t
he mainstay of
 
t
he Polish
 -
 - 
a
lso change.
 
Parents who send t
heir children to S
aturday school pay a small t
uition
 
f
ee; b
ut t
hey are often making a considerable sacrifice of t
ime and effort.
 
S
aturday may be the parents' only f
ree day for shopping and errands, and coming
 
to Pulaski  i
s a 14
0 -6
0 m
ile r
ound-trip for suburban f
amilies.
 Getting the k
ids
 
t
here every week requires dedication and motiv ation from the p
arents as well
 
a
s t
he children.
 
P
arents a
lso attend occasional Parent-Teacher meetings and special holiday
 
shows which the students present.
 The b
ig events are at Christmas and E
aster.
 
Some p
arents become quite i
nvolved and donate a l
ot of t
ime to helping out w
ith
 
f
und-raising activities, organizing t
he children's performances, and serving
 
on the School Board.
 Others w
ith l
ess t
ime to g
ive just manage to get the
 
children to school.
 
Several parents complained that t
heir whole S
aturday i
s t
aken up; they try
 
t
o p
lan other activities l
ike music l
essons or Scout meetings for t
he same day
 
so as to make as few t
rips around town as possible.  The school t
ries to help

inimize t
rips by p
lanning r
ehearsals f
or special shows during school hours.
 
Some p
arents  i
nvolve t
heir children i
n other ethnic organizations such
 
as dance groups, Scouts, and fraternal organizations.
 Others a
llow t
heir
 
children t
o become more i
nvolved i
n non-ethnic activities, such a
s cheerleading
 
and s
chool sports.
 
College education for their children seemed to be a h
igh p
riority of
 
Pulaski p
arents.
 Cuttings i
n the Pulaski scrapbook a
lso i
ndicated p
ride i
n t
he
 
f
urther educational achievements of t
hd graduates.
 
PULASKI STUDENTS
 
To attend Polish school  i
s a major commitment of t
ime and extra effort
 
on t
he part of the students.  Many students, especially those i
n t
he suburbs,
 
have l
ong commutes.  Many make an extra effort i
n order to attend P
ulaski
 
School  i
n particular, t
hough another school may be c
loser.
 Some come to
 
continue a f
amily tradition of attendance t
here, or because t
hey do not want
 
to transfer to another school, or because Pulaski has a h
igh school and they
 
can f
inish a
ll  twelve years i
n the same school.
 
But certainly many more children S
tart Polish school  than graduate.
 
The h
igh school especially r
equires a great deal of effort as t
he material
 
becomes more challenging.
 
Helena Z
iolkowska characterized t
he Polish h
igh school graduates:
 "Only
 
t
he dedicated and motivated students really survive and go through h
igh school.
 
But once t
hey f
inish you really can converse with t
hem f
luently .
.. t
hey have
 
good k
nowledge of l
iterature, can write a good paper."
 
Stude6ts at Pulaski seemed to agree on why t
hey attend; at l
east at
 
f
irst;
 "My parents make me."  However, t
hey explained, students e
ither just
 
"get u
sed t
o i
t," and quit f
ighting t
he i
nevitable; or they get really i
nterested
 
or t
hey eventually drop out.
 I
n some cases i
t seemed to depend on how much
 
22
 
p
ressure t
he parents could exert.
 Very l
ikely t
here i
s a delicate b
alance
 
i
n each f
amily between t
he w
ishes of p
arents and children.
 
O
lder P
ulaski s
tudents r
aised two d
ifferent r
easons for attending.
 One
 
group was t
here to l
earn Polish l
anguage i
n order t
o have a second l
anguage for
 
u
se i
n college, career or b
usiness; a foreign l
anguage would help t
hem get
 
ahead i
n l
ife.
 Other students who had v
isited relatives  i
n Poland, as many
 
had, had personally experienced the u
sefulness and satisfaction of being able
 
to speak Polish with f
amily and get around i
n another country.
 For t
hem,
 
this ability was sufficient r
eason to continue  t
heir study of P
olish.
 
PULASKI S
CHOOL ADMINISTRATION
 
E
ducationally, Pulaski School subscribes to t
he PTAA curriculum guidelines.
 
Administratively, however, Pulaski  i
s i
ndependent, l
ike the other PTAA schools.
 
Pulaski's administrative structure i
s much l
ike other American schools;
 
t
here i
s a School  Board and a Parent-Teacher Association.
 A
ll parents with
 
children at Pulaski are automatically members of t
he Parent-Teacher Association.
 
A few "old" parents, whose children have graduated, a
lso remain active.
 I
n
 
addition to officers, t
he PTA e
lects a committee of people who do most of t
he
 
support work.
 
Most of Pulaski School's budget i
s r
aised from t
uition.
 I
n 1
981-82
 
p
arents paid $
75 per child per year; $
85 for two children from t
he same family;
 
$
90 for t
hree children.  Tuition r
aised $
14,000, a s
izable part of t
he budget.
 
Additional f
unds are r
aised t
hrough two dances held by the Parent-Teacher
 
Association.  Pulaski, l
ike a
ll  the other PTAA schools, receives some support
 
f
rom donations channeled through the Polish Teachers Association.
 
The main expenses of t
he school are rent and t
eachers' salaries.
 Rent
 
costs about $
4000 a year.  Teachers receive $
100 per month and t
he principal
 
$
125.
 Smaller expenses i
nclude small St. N
icholas g
ifts for t
he children at
 
Christmas, expenses for some student presentations
., awarc, d
iplomas, and a

When a student has committed twelve years of Saturdays to Polish
 
school, what in the final analysis does she take away?  Patricia
 
Witkowski, now a law student and an employee of the Illinois Depart-
ment of Human Rights, shared her feelings about Polish School.
 She
 
grew up in South Chicago, a neighborhood on the far southern end of
 
the city, twenty-five  miles from the Polish Triangle.
 Each Satur-
day from the time she was three she made the trip, with her parents,
 
to Polish school.
 (And although the family lives even further away,
 
in southern suburb South Holland, her brother attends Pulaski
 
School.)
 
?olish was spoken in the Witkowski home, and Ms. Witkowski a .
o
 
ded Polish parochial schools.
 In her parochial schools, hcwever,
 
Polish was not used or encouraged.
 
fluent
 
Ms. Witkowski has continued to use herVknowledge
 of Polish
 
language as
 secretary of her lodge of the Polish National Alliance,
 
and in translating news releases for other Polish organizations.
 
But though parents, teachers and administrators stress that the goal
 
of Polish school is to teach Polish language, Ms. Witkowski did
 
not stress her knowledge of Polish as the  most important result of
 
her years in Polish school.
 
Instead she talked about the difficulties of growing up ethnic,
 
speaking Polish and wearing pigtails "when it wasn't 'in' to be ethnic."
 
In the face of many messages and images from mainstream society
 
about "dumb Polacks," Polish jokes, and other negative stereotypes,
 
she felt that it was easy to be defens ive about being Polish.
 Polish
 
school, however, counteracted for her the negative stereotypes by
 
27
 
providing "a sense of history,  culture, ethnic identity... (
the feeling
 
that) .
.. hey, I belong to a group of people and they are important."
 
Like many Americans in our complex society,  she felt that she
 
has
 "neat little compartments," one of which is being Polish.
 Polish
 
school gave her self-confidence to deal with problems which seemed
 
to bother her friends who were not given a strong sense of Polish
 
history.
 As she got older,  she could accept and find strength in
 
"being different."
 
Ms. Witkowski has been active through the years in many Polish
 
community organizations, including a high school dance group, the
 
Sea League of America, and the Polish National Alliance; and in
 
events such as the Bobby Vinton telethon and demonstrations for
 
in support of the Solidarity union in Poland.

Witold Pawlikowski is President of the Pulaski Parent_T eac
ho 
Association, and William Bogdanowicz is Vice-President.
 Their person
 
histories are similar and since they are perhaps shared by others
 
involved in the Polish schools, are here described  together.
 
Both were born in 1931 in Poland.
 During the war their families
 
were deported to Siberia when the Soviet Union invaded Poland.
 After
 
great hardships,y
g menof the families succeeded in enlisting in a
 
Polish Division recruited in the Polish camps in Siberia; family
 
members  were allowed to go with them to the Middle East.  After the
 
war, these divisjd ns  
were demobilized in England "many families later
 
made their way to the United States.
 
28
 
Mr. Pawlikowski served in the U.S. Army before settling in
 
Chicago in 1957.
 He now works for the Federal Energy Regulatory
 
Commission as an engineer.
 He married the former Yolantha Zurczak,
 
whose parents both teach in the Polish schools  (as principal and
 
teacher at Pulaski School); their daughter Beata attends Pulaski
 
High School.
 
Mr. Bogdanowicz works in computing for International Harvester.
 
He has three children, who all attend or have graduated from
 
Pulaski School.
 
Jozef  urczak
  
Jozef Zurczak is principal of Pulaski School.
 Before becoming
 
principal he taught elementary grades for a number of years.
 
Mr.  Zurczak was born in 1910 in Houlthausen, Germany, an area with
 
a substantial Polish minority.
 He later moved to Poland, where he
 
graduated from teacher's college and taught school, and was also active
 
in Polish Scouts and choir.
 His wife Maria, also a teacher, and he
 
had two children before World War II broke out.
 
An officer in the Polish Army, Mr. Zurczak was taken prisoner
 
and spent much of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.
 
After the war he was reunited with his family and began teaching in the
 
displaced persons camp schools for Polish children.
 In 1949 the
 
family came to the U.S.  Mr. Zurczak worked for a meat company, the
 
telephone company, and other jobs before retiring from the First
 
Federal Bank.
 
In the late 1960's and again in the mid-70's, the Zurczaks both
 
taught in the Polish schools.
 When he began to teach,  said Mr.  Zur-
czak, it was a "real holiday.
 In the beginning nobody asks how much
 
you pay."  As for many other Polish teachers, it was his only chance
 
to practice his real profession. At 72 the oldest teacher in the
 
Polish schools  (
followed closely by his wife, age 70), Mr.  Zurczak
 
remains a vibrant teacher whose rapport with children is evident in
 
the classroom.

NEEDS OF THE POLISH SCHOOLS
 
The Polish Teachers Association schools have identified several
 
needs of immediate importance.
 One of the most urgent is to obtain
 
8
f
 
some kind recognition for their efforts from the mainstream American
 
education system.
 
Recognition would greatly aid the
hoo1s
 
in attracting new
 
students as well as retaining current students and encouraging them
 
to continue through high school.
 
In Illinois, there have been several efforts by the PalishTschools,
 
as well as by
 
accreditation
 
and graduates
 
a coalition of ethnic educators, to obtain state
 
or foreign language credit for ethnic school students
 
in public and private high schools and colleges.
 
Most have failed.
 This is a source of puzzlement and anger:
 
3
]-
"For as long as twenty years, at every annual meeting of various
 
P.T.A. Boards, angry parents demand that their children's Polish
 
language knowledge be formally recognized by the Chicago area public
 
and Catholic high schools.
 It is really hard to explain (to them)
 
why it cannot be done."
 (
Footnote:
 Helena Ziolkowska,  "Polish
 
Saturday Schools in the Chicaoo Area:
 Their Growth and Development,'
 
paper presented at the Illinois Foreign Language Teachers Association
 
Meeting,  1982, Chicago, Illinois).
 
Only the Chicago Board of Education has responded.
 It sponsors
 
a program of testing whereby students may obtain one year of foreic
 
language credit  (
33 languages are offered), on the condition that
 
they continue to study the language for one more year within the
 
public school system.
 (
Note:
 Where necessary, the Board of Education
 
For further info, see P. Franchini in American Educ. 
will even supply a tutor..
 But the Polish schools feel that this
 
does not go far enough, when their students may enter high school
 
with the equivalent of several years of high school level Polish
 
language study.
 
Polish and other ethnic schools also wonder why they have so much
 
difficulty receiving credit when they are supplying a resource much
 
in demand by government and business.
 In 1979, the report of the
 
President's Commission on Foreign Language and International Studies
 
reported an alarming decline in foreign language study in the U.S.
 
and called for steps to remedy a serious lack of a pool of people
 
trained in foreign languages.
 Public and private schools, in times
 
of rapidly waning resources, may not be able to meet the need.
 Thus
 
the ethnic schools feel that their resources in this area are overlooked.
 
32
 
Two other pressing problems for the Polish schools are space
 
and textbooks,  since funds for both are limited.
 The need for solid
 
but affordable space has been largely met by renting Catholic school
 
buildings.
 This Solution is often unsatisfactory,  since the Polish
 
school must depend on the parish.
 Past experience has shown that
 
this relationship can be tenous; this insecurity makes  them long to
 
own their own buildings.
 
Textbooks are a common problem for many of the ethnic schools.
 
The need is great for textbooks designed specifically for their needs,
 
but volunteer time is limited, even from the most willing.
 In
 
order to develop quality textbooks, more time is necessary than
 
that available in the evenings or on weekends, sandwiched in between
 
work and family commitments.
 So the ethnic schools are beginning
 
to think of turning to mainstream educational resources such as
 
granting agencies and textbook publishing houses for support.
 
This step may be a slow one, however, for there are suspicions
 
that mainstream resources are not really available to them or that
 
undesirable strings might be attached to outside aid.
 The notion
 
of paying professionals, even those among them rto do this work,
 
also has little support in a community with a strong tradition of
 
volunteer service.

POLISH SATURDAY SCHOOLS IN CHICAGO
 
Patricia Witkowski grew up in South Chicago, a neighborhood on
 
Chicago's far southeast side.
 From the time she was three, Patricia
 
made a once-a-week, fifty-mile round trip to a neighborhood then known
 
as the Polish Triangle, just northwest of downtown, to attend Polish
 
Saturday School.
 
Patricia grew up speaking Polish at home.
 She also attended parochial
 
schools in predominantly Polish parishes, but there the Polish language
 
was not encouraged.
 Growing up in the 60's, she was speaking Polish and
 
wearing pigtails "when it wasn't '
in' to be ethnic."  Faced with countless
 
messages and images stressing the negative stereotype of the "dumb Polack,"
 
Patricia easily felt defensive about being Polish.
 
5
o g
oing to Polish Saturday School was worth the aggravation of another
 
day of school.
 Polish school counteracted the negative stereotypes
 
encountered elsewhere, and provided "a sense of history, culture,  ethnic
 
identity.  .
.
.
 [and the feeling thai
 
.
.. hey,  I belong to a group of people
 
and they are important.
 This feeling gave Patricia confidence to
 
deal with the problem of "being different" that seemed to bother friends
 
who had not been given a strong sense of Polish identity.
 
Patricia has been active through the years in other Polish organizations,
 
including a high school dance group, the Polish National Alliance
 
(
where she served as Polish language secretary of her lodge), and the Sea
 
League of America
 (
where she served as a translator).
 She certainly
 
values her fluency in the Polish language, a noteworthy accomplishment for
 
someone raised in the United States.
 But more than anything e
lse, she says,
 
the Polish Saturday Schools nourished a sense of self-worth as a Polish American.

Witold Pawlikowski was just a small boy in 1939 when the Soviet Union
 
invaded Poland and occupied his hometown.
 His father disappeared without
 
a trace, and the rest of the family was deported to Siberia.  After many
 
months of great hardship, some young Polish men were recruited out of the
 
Siberian camps to join the Polish army and take their families with them.
 
In this way, the Pawlikowski family reached the Middle East.  After the
 
war, they joined the demobilized Polish Army in England.
 Later they emigrated
 
to the United States, where Witold served in the U.S. Army.
 In 1957,
 
he settled in Chicago where he completed his education as an engineer.
 
As a result of his childhood experiences, Mr. Pawlikowski felt
 
strongly that his child should know her Polish heritage of language, history,
 
and traditions.
 He wanted her to not only be able to speak the language
 
at home, but to know Polish grammar and read Polish literature.  He and
 
his wife Yolanthe, the daughter of two teachers active in Chicago's
 
Polish Saturday Schools, cajoled and supported their daughter through twelve
 
years of Polish school.
 Beata Pawlikowski is a graduate of Pulaski
 
Saturday School/High School.
 
The Witkowski and Pawlikowski families are members of Chicago Polonia,
 
a strong and viable ethnic community.
 They and many like them in Chicago's
 
diverse ethnic groups feel compelled to retain and pass on to their children
 
the traditions, values, and symbols that are part of their ethnic identity.
 
Indeed, metropolitan Chicago is a mosaic of ethnic communities.  Many
 
are well-established and experienced in blending old country traditions
 
with those encountered in the United States; other newly-arrived immigrants
 
are just beginning this process.
 
3
 
Chicago ethnic groups educate their children as ethnic Americans in
 
many ways, from family training, to church and lodge activities, to formal
 
ethnic schooling.
 Ethnic heritage schools are found in at least twenty
 
communities, and perhaps many more.
 Chicago Polonia, one of the largest
 
ethnic groups in the area, claims over 3/4 of a million people of Polish
 
descent, and supports a network of fifteen Polish Saturday Schools.
 
The Saturday schools are coordinated by an umbrella organization of
 
professional Polish educators, the Polish Teachers Association in America,
 
Inc.  (
PTAA).
 These schools--generally called Polish Language Schools
 
or Polish Saturday Schools--meet on Saturdays and offer instruction in
 
Polish language and history for students from kindergarten through high
 
school.  Polish High School graduates speak Polish fluently and have a
 
command of the written language,  literary traditions, and Polish history.
 
Students also gain a sense of confidence and pride in being Polish
 
American.  Maintaining these schools i
s a community effort which requires
 
so much energy that it is obviously a labor of love, one of absolute
 
importance to those involved.
 
Polish schools strive to transmit a positive sense of ethnic identity
 
through knowledge of a particular set of ethnic symbols.
 As in many
 
ethnic heritage schools, language and language acquisition is perhaps
 
the key symbol of ethnic identity.
 In the wake of the ethnic revival of
 
the 1970.'s, many ethnic communities have more clearly articulated this goal.
 
The Saturday schools were established in the early 1950's by Polish
 
refugees who did not return to Communist Poland after World War I
I.
 These
 
immigrants were for the most part well-educated professionals, raised in
 
a newly-reunited Poland with a strong sense of Polish nationalism.  They
 
wanted their American children to value their Polish identity and actively
 
4
 
sought ways to accomplish this goal.
 
Yet, ethnic education had been a concern in Chicago for many years.
 
A kind of Polish education system had sprung from within the parochial
 
schools of Polish parishes, where Polish-speaking nuns and priests
 
taught the children of turn-of-the-century immigrants.
 Poland had not
 
existed as a nation for a hundred years, so the immigrants' sense of group
 
identity was tied to ethnicity and regional origin rather than nationality.
 
They did not actively seek to organize. Polish schooling, yet a whole
 
generation of Polish Americans grew up speaking "Chicago Po li sh
.!
 
EARLY POLISH EDUCATION IN CHICAGO
 
At the turn of the century, when the great wave of immigration brought
 
thousands of Poles to the Chicago area, Poland did not exist as a nation.
 
In 1795, Poland had been partitioned among Russia, Prussia and Austria,
 
and ethnic Poles referred to themselves as "Russian Poles," or "Austrian
 
Poles."  They often clung to their Roman Catholic religion as an important
 
ethnic marker.
 
Thus language, ethnicity, regional origin  and religion, rather
 
than nationality, were the distinctive characteristics of this early group
 
of Polish immigrants.  They were mostly peasants with little formal
 
education who came for economic reasons, working hard so that their
 
children might struggle up the ladder of American mobility.
 Part of that
 
struggle was education, and education for many of these children began in
 
Polish parochial schools.
 
In Chicago, Poles sought to establish Catholic parishes that were
 
"Polish" in character.  Many churches were built, and with them schools were
 
established.
 In these parish schools, where many or all of the students
 
came from Polish-speaking homes, and the teaching nuns also spoke Polish,
 
Polish language was part of the curriculum perhaps more by default than
 
by design.
 Each school was free to set its own use of Polish language,
 
and schools seem to have varied widely.
 Depending on the school or even
 
the individual teacher, students might study only religious subjects
 
or a wide range of the curriculum in Polish.
 Thus the "Polish" nature
 
of instruction in these parish schools seems to have arisen from the fact
 
that teachers and students were all of Polish descent, rather than from
 
an explicit desire to impart to students a mastery of the Polish language
 
or articulated values from the traditions of Poland.
 
Polish instruction in parochial schools began to decline in the
 
1930's, although it persisted for another twenty years.
 The Depression,
 
pressures from the Archdiocese (
historically dominated by Irish and Geiinan
 
clerics hostile to parishes that clung to an ethnic interpretation of
 
Catholicism) to rid the parishes of "foreign" association, and
 
pressure on immigrants to assimilate contributed to this declir
'
.
 
Polish immigration to Chicago was halted in the 1920's by restrictive
 
U
.S.  immigration laws.
 Isolated from Poland for almost thirty years, the
 
Polish community evolved their own Polish American traditions.
 "Chicago
 
Polish" arose as American-born children learned to speak the Polish language based
 
on the various regional dialects spoken by their parents and teachers.
 
The post-World War II immigrants were surprised to find many "archaic"
 
and dialect words and grammatical structures preserved in the speech of
 
the established Polish American community.
 
The thousands of new immigrants who flooded the country from the refugee
 
camps of Europe were to have a profound impact on the nature of Chicago
 
Polonia (
FN:
 and in fact on many established American ethnic communities
 
with roots in Eastern and Central Europe,  such as the Lithuanians, Germans,
 
Serbs, and so forth).
 
Post-World War II Refugees and the Saturday Schools  
The new refugees, who came from a Poland briefly reunited between
 
the world wars,  had been raised with intense feelings of Polish nationalism.
 
These feelings were reinforced by the knowledge that they could not go back
 
to Poland.  They felt disinherited, which engendered a deep need to keep
 
alive things Polish and to pass on pride and knowledge of what i
t meant
 
to be Polish to their children raised in the United States.
 
Many of the new refugees were educated professionals, and for them knowledge
 
of the contemporary, standard Polish language was an important attribute of
 
being Polish.
 They wanted their children to speak the language and learn
 
Polish history and national traditions in a more structured way than parents
 
could provide in the home.
 Their symbols of "being Polish" differed markedly
 
frpm those of the established Polish American community.
 
Thus arose the need for a new kind of "Polish" education not supplied
 
in the parochial schools.  Many of the new arrivals did send their children
 
to Polish parochial schools for their regular education, but they also felt
 
a need to create special Polish schools that concentrated on Polish education.
 
In the 1950's, as "Polish" education in parochial schools declined, the Polls,
 
Saturday schools evolved.
 
World War II experiences shaped the development of the Chicago Polish
 
Saturday schools.
 The founders of the Polish Teachers Association in America,
 
and a great many of the teachers and parents currently active in the Polish
 
schools, were adults or young children in Poland during World War I
I.
 After
 
the war, many Poles found themselves in two main geographic locations outside
 
Poland:  displacedpersons (
"d.p." or refugee) camps in Germany; and temporary
 
camps in England for those associated with the Polish Army.
 (
FN:
 During
 
the war, the Polish Government in Exile had established itself in
 
England, and the Polish Army fought with the British Army.
 When the war
 
ended, the Polish Army was demobilized in England.

In b
oth the German and English camps, s
chools were set up by P

teachers.
 In Germany, the premise of the s
chools was that the children
 
would be returning to Poland, and s
o the regular P
olish curriculum was used.
 
In England, a sort of bilingual school system developed, so that students
 
could continue their studies in either English or Polish universities.  To
 
this end, Polish language, culture and history were taught in P
olish; all oth
 
subjects were taught in English.  This division of curriculum foreshadowed
 
the Saturday schools; in Chicago s

the "Polish Triangle," where Ashland, Division, and Milwaukee Avenues
 
meet on the near northwest side of Chicago.
 
The schools met in the Polish Triangle until the early 1970's,
 
serving thousands of students.
 Pulaski,  for example, had 1000 s
tudents
 
in 1970.
 
However, the neighborhood was fundamentally changed by the construction
 
of the John F
.  Kennedy Expressway.
 Chicago Polonia saved two magnificent
 
Polish churches from being razed, but the character of the neighborhood
 
did not survive.
 The city built low-income housing, and Polish resident
 
to move out.
 The neighborhood is now primarily Hispanic, although Polish
 
churches, organizations, and businesses remain.
 New immigrants from Poland
 
also settle in the neighborhood, although they too have found a larger
 
niche furthe,r north on Milwaukee Avenue.
 Newer arrivals terdto move further
 
out to other city and suburban neighborhoods as they become economically
 
e
stablished.
 
As families moved out of the old neighborhood,  it became increasingly
 
difficult for students to attend Saturday school there.
 Some families had
 
reservations about safety in the area, and enrollment soon dropped.
 
But the significant numbers of Polish families settling in new
 
communities, mostly in the far northwest Chicago neighborhoods and in the
 
northwest and western suburbs, made the founding of new Polish schools
 
possible.
 In the late 1960's, schools had been established in Hammond,
 
Indiana (
just across the Indiana-Illinois state line from Chicago) and in
 
Cicero, I
llinois, a suburb just west of Chicago.
 During the 1970's,
 
nine new schools were opened, and since 1980 two new Chicago-area schools
 
have started.
 
In 1980, Polish Saturday schools enrolled around 2000 students.
 By
 
1981-82, enrollment had increased to 3000.
 Part of this increase can
 
9
 
probably be attributed to the steady growth of the newer,  smaller schools.
 
Polish Teachers Association in America (
PTAA) administrators suggested
 
two other factors as well:
 the election of a Polish Pope, and the
 
struggle of the Solidarity Union in Poland and the worldwide
 
public support and sympathy that has resulted.
 
The administrators felt that these positive factors helped to
 
counteract negative stereotypes of Polishness,  such as those embodied in
 
the image of the "dumb Polack" in Polish jokes.  These stereotypes, along
 
with the generally negative feelings about being "ethnic," they felt, prevent
 
many Poles and Americans of Polish descent from participating in the Polish
 
schools.  However, the schools have no hard data on why their enrollment
 
has increased, and increased immigration of young parents from Poland
 
may be an important reason.
 
All Polish schools are named for famous Poles, underscoring the indepen-
dent, national orientation of the schools.
 The two earliestschools were
 
named for the first well-known Polish Americans, Revolutionary War Generals
 
Casimir Pulaski and Thadeusz Kosciuzko.
 Other schools are named after
 
popular figures from World War II such as St. Maksymilian Kolbe and Goner, ,.
 
Anders.  Copernicus, Paderewskj, Sienkiewjcz, and Chopin Schools are named
 
for famous scientists and artists; Maria Konopnicka School commemorates
 
a much-loved poet.
 St. Maksymilian and Pope John Paul I
I schools (
there
 
are several named after the Pope) are definitely Polish in symbolism rather
 
than religious—there are no schools named for other saints or popes.

GENERAL  CASIMIP
.  PULASKI  POLISH  SCHOOL
 
General  Casimir  Pulaski  Polish  School  offers  classes  from
 
the  first  grade  through  high  school,  and  is  one  of  the  four
 
Polish  high  schools  fed  by  the  more  numerous  grammar  schools.
 
Pulaski  School  met  in  various  locations  in  the  Polish
 
Triangle  area  from  the  early  1950's  to  1978.
 The  school
 
presently  uses  the  St.  Wenceslaus  Roman  Catholic  parish  school
 
building  located  at  3435  North  Lawndale  in  Chicago.
 The  school
 
grew  rapidly  from  200  students  in  1954,  to  850  students  in  1961,
 
(when  high  school  classes  formed),  to  1000  students  in  1970  (j ust
 
before  the  dispersal  of
 the  schools).
 In
 1981 -82,  350  students
 
were  enrolled.
 
The  parish  school  hall  in  the  basement  of  the  building  is
 
used  by  Pulaski  for  school  assemblies  and  a parents'  waiting
 
room;  the  classrooms  are  on  two  upper  floors.
 On  a regular
 
Saturday  school  day,  there  are  usually  several  parents  in  the
 
hail  helping  with  school  business,  visiting  or  reading  the  paper.
 
Coffee  and  home-made  pastries  such  as  puczki  are  available.
 
Ten  classes  are  in  session  both  before  and  after  noon.
 
Grades  1-8  each  meet  in  two  sections.
 Two  of  the  high  school
 
1
1
 
classes  meet  before  noon  and  two  meet  in  the  afternoon.
 Students
 
who  participate  in  so-called  "extracurricular  activities"
 
(singing,  poetry  recitation,  and  dancing)  either  stay  late  or
 
come  earlier  than  their  class  sessions.
 
The  primary  goal  of  the  school  is  to  teach  the  Polish
 
language.
 To  this  end,  all  grades  stress  language  skills  and
 
all  classes  are  conducted  entirely  in  Polish.
 In  the  primary
 
grades,  first  through  third,  reading  and writing  are  the main
 
subjects.
 (As  in  Poland,  children  are  never  taught  to  print;
 
they  immediately  learn  script).
 Some  Polish  history  and
 
traditions  are  introduced,  primarily through  legends  and  stories
 
told  to  the  class.
 In the  intermediate  grades,  Polish  language
 
skills  are  continued,  literature  introduced,  and  Polish  history
 
and  geography  taught  as  separate  subjects.
 The  high  school
 
grades  stress  the  study of  Polish  literature  and  history.
 
Although  all  the  students  speak  some  Polish,  command  of  the
 
language varies  greatly.
 Everyone  acknowledges  that  the  students
 
are  all  most  comfortable  speaking  English.
 One  first-grade
 
teacher  felt  that  she  essentially  presents  Polish  as  a second
 
language.
 If  students  persist  with  Polish  studies,  however,  and
 
graduate  from  a Polish  high  school,  they  are  expected to  have  a
 
fluent  knowledge  of  spoken  and  written  Polish  and  also  be  able  to
 
write  well.
 The  high  school  classes  cover  high  school  level
 
material  in  Polish.
 The  school  is  particularly  proud of  its  high
 
school  level  graduates.
 
12
 
Discipline  is  one  theme  stressed  by  parents,  teachers,  and
 
school  officials.
 In  Polish  and  other  European  educational
 
systems,  a certain  distance  between  teacher  and  students  is
 
traditioanlly  part  of  the  way  students  express  respect  for  the
 
teacher.
 This  tradition  is,  ideally,  maintained  at  Pulaski.
 
This  meant  that  classes  are  quiet,  and  that  students  stand  by
 
their  desks  to  give  their  responses.
 However,  teachers  were
 
affectionate  with  the  youngest  students  and  cordial  with  the
 
older  pupils.
 
Teachers  at  Pulaski  range  from  young,  recent  arrivals  from
 
Poland  to  Mrs.  Zurczak,  who  in  1982  celebrated  her  fiftieth  year
 
in  teaching,  including  many  years  in  the  Polish  Saturday
 
schools.
 Only  the  first  grade  teacher,  Mrs.  Helena  Sromek,  holds
 
both  Polish  and  American  teaching  credentials.
 One  of  the  high
 
school  teachers,  Dr.  Janina  Kras,  holds  the  Ph. D.  from
 
Jagellonian  University,  Poland' s  oldest  and  most-respected
 
institution  of  higher  education.
 
Like  each  school  in  the  network,  Pulaski  maintains  its  own
 
independent  school  administration.
 A Parent-Teacher  Association
 
elects  a school  board.
 Tuition  covers  the  majority  of  school
 
expenses,  with  remaining  funds  coming  from  contributions  by
 
Polish  organizations  (channeled  through  the  PTAA)  and
 
fund-raising  efforts  by  parents.
 Parents  are  very  active  in
 
running  the  school;  they  serve  on  the  School  Board,  sew  costumes
 
1
3
 
for  school  presentations,  and  hake  for  the  yearly  fund-raiser.
 
Some  Polish  schools  have  chosen  to  affiliate  with  other
 
Polish  charitable  organizations  (such  as  the  Polish  National
 
Alliance or  the  Polish  Roman  Catholic  Union)  which  then help  to
 
support  the  school.
 Pulaski,  like  the majority  of  the  Polish
 
schools,  chooses  to  remain  unaffiliated  in  order  to  maintain  full
 
control  over  school  affairs.
 
Each  Polish  school  makes  its  own  arrangements  for  housing,
 
usually  renting  from a parochial  school,  and  negotiates  rent  and
 
teacher  salaries.
 With  fifteen  schools  in  the  network,
 
arrangements  are quite  diverse,  reflecting  among  other  factors
 
the  economic  situation of  school  parents  and
 how
 inor
-
the  parish  is  toward  the  Saturday  school
 
The  Polish  Teachers  Association  in  America  addresses  shared
 
concerns  of  the  schools.
 One  major  concern  is  the  unique
 
curriculum needs  of  ethnic  schools.
 Language  and other  texts
 
developed  for  use  in  the  home  country do  not  relate  to  the
 
experience of  children  growing  up  in  the  United  States;  while
 
books  developed  for  students  with  no  knowledge  of  a language  are
 
inappropriate  for  children  who  speak  the  language  at  home.
 Thus
 
ethnic  schools  are  forced  to  adapt  books  which  are  not  suited  to
 
their  needs  or  write  new ones.
 
For  many  years,  individual  teachers  tried  to  fill  the  gap  as
 
1
4
 
best  they  could.
 In  the mid-1960's,  the  PTAA began  to  sponsor
 
the development  of  appropriate texts.
 Their  first  project  was
 
Polska Mowa (The  Polish  Language), an  introduction  to  Polish
 
language  for older  children  and  adults.
 Now  in  its  eighth
 
edition,  Polska Mowa is  used  not  only  in  Polish  Saturday
 
Schools  in  the  United  States,  Canada,  England  and  Australia,  but
 
in  college  and  high  school  Polish  language  classes.
 
Later projects  focused  on  developing  readers  in  literature
 
and history  for  elementary  and  junior  high grades,  since  high
 
school  classes  can  often  use  high  school  texts  from  Poland.
 
History texts,  however,  are  a very  sensitive  subject,  since  texts
 
from  Poland written  since  the  Communist  take-over  are  considered
 
unacceptable.
 With  this  in mind,  the  PTAA developed  a
 
four-volume  History of  Poland. 
Texts  are  also  exchanged  witi
 
Polish  schools  in other  countries,  where  similar  efforts  take
 
place.
 
As many new  Polish  schools  opened  in  the  1970's,  the  PTAA
 
also  saw the  need  for  a standardized  curriculum  ,
 to
 aid
 
teachers  and  let  students  move more  easily  between  schools  if
 
they needed to.
 This  effort  reflects  the  desire  to  create  an
 
educational  experience where  students  really master  the  language,
 
rather  than  just  having the  opportunity to  spend  time  in  a
 
Polish-oriented  environment.
 
The  PTAA  has  established  guidelines  for  the  types  of  classes
 
'
5
 
to  be  offered:
 kindergarten;  eight  years  of  elementary  school
 
r Polish-speaking  children;  four  years  of  high  school  for
 
Dlish-speaking  children;  classes  for  children  who  do  not  speak
 
:ng,  music,  dance  and  theater  program.
 
-
 -
i
 guidelines  for  each  year  are  being  developed.
 
The  PTAA  also  provides  other  services  which  benefit  all  of
 
the  schools.
 The  group  functions  first  as  a professional
 
organization  for  all  teachers  of  Polish  descent,  even  those  not
 
teaching  in  Polish  schools.
 The  PT
A  sponsors  related  activities
 
to  promote  Polish  language  teaching,  notably  popular  essay  and
 
poetry  recitation  contests.
 In  1982,  a poetry  recitation  contest
 
attracted  enthusiastic  participation  from  800  students  from
 
Polish  Saturday  schools,  public  and  private  high  school  Polish
 
classes,  and  area  colleges.
 The  PTAA  also  exchanges  reports  and
 
textbooks  with  similar  teachers'  organizations  in  Canada  and
 
England.
 
The  PTAA offers  a small  lending  library  of  teaching  aids  to
 
the  Polish  SAturday  schools  including  pictures,  slide-tape
 
programs,  and  equipment.
 The  organization  supports  the
 
activities  of  many of  the  other  Chicago-area  Polish  institutions.
 
In  turn,  Polish  organizations  as  well  as  individuals  contribute
 
to  the  PTAA.
 Funds  are  channeled  to  the  various  Polish  schools
 
from  a major  annual  fund-raiser,  the  Day of  Polish  Schools
 
Picnic.

PTAA Teachers
 
Today  90%  of  the teachers  in  the  Polish  schools  were  born
 
and  educated  in  Poland;  most  hold  specialized teacher training  or
 
advanced  degrees.
 In  Poland,  teaching  is  a highly-respected  if
 
poorly-paid  profession.
 In  Chicago,  many of  these  teachers  find
 
themselves  unable  to  retrain  to  teach  in  American  schools  and
 
must  take manual  labor  jobs  to  support  themselves.
 Being  unable
 
to  work  in  their  profession  is  a blow to  their  self-esteem,  and
 
so  immigrant  teachers  seek  out  the  Polish  schools.
 
There,  they  are  their  real  selves.
 Some  say  that  "they only
 
feel  like people  on  Saturdays."
 Others  feel  strongly that  they
 
should not  waste  specialized training  and talents.
 Some  younger
 
women  at  home  with  small  children  find  Saturday  school  a
 
convenient  part-time  job.
 
Motivation  must  be  considerable  to  keep  teachers  in  the
 
schools  when  there  is  little  pay  left  after  gas  and  childcare
 
expenses.
 One  teacher  noted  that  during  the  1960's  she worked
 
for  $6.00  a day  and paid her  babysitter  $10.00.
 Salaries  now
 
range  from  $6.00  to  $10.00  per  hour.
 
Teachers  range  in  age  from  25  to  70.
 The many  younger,
 
newly-arrived  teachers  help  to  keep  the most  contemporary  Polish
 
language  in  the  schools.
 A few teachers  who  are  native  speakers
 
17
 
of  English  and  Polish,  raised  in  the  United  States,  teach  the
 
"English-speaking  classes
 
The  PTAA  is  very  concerned  about  upholding  standards  and
 
verifies  credentials  for  teachers  who  apply for  positions.
 The
 
organization  also  sponsors  teacher  training  and  in-service
 
seminars  and  has  co-sponsored  courses  to help new  arrivals  gain
 
an  American  teaching  credential.
 
Parents
 
Parents  are  the  core  of  the  Polish  schools.
 The  parents'
 
need  for  Polish  education  for  their  children  fuels  the
 
organization  of  new schools  and the  dedication  to  bringing
 
children to  school  every  Saturday.
 
Post-war  immigrant  parents  wanted  their  Polish-speaking
 
children to  become  literate  in  Polish  and  know  Polish history  and
 
culture.
 They  felt  that  a formal  educational  environment  would
 
be  better  than trying  to  teach  these  subjects  at  home.
 The
 
relative  importance of  these  factors  varies,  of  course,  from
 
family to  family,  as  does  the  commitment  to  speaking  Polish  at
 
home  and to  helping  children  with  Polish  school  homework.
 
Parents  who  send  their  children  to  Polish  school  pay  a small
 
tuition  fee,  but  often  make  a considerable  sacrifice  of  time  and
 
effort,  giving  up  their  only  free  day  for  shopping  and  errands.
 
18
 
Getting  the  children  to  school  requires  dedication  and motivation
 
when  it may be  as much  as  a 60-mile  round  trip  for  suburban
 
residents.  (The  schools  recognize  these  difficulties;  at  the  1982
 
Pulaski  High  School  graduation  banquet,  a young  woman who  lived
 
in  a distant  suburb received  a special  award  for  perfect
 
attendance).
 Parents  also  support  the  school  through volunteer
 
activities,  and  attend  special  programs  at  the  school  at
 
Christmas  and  Easter.
 
The high  priority  set  on  education  in  Polish  school  families
 
is  reflected  in  their  desire  to  send  their  children  to  college.
 
Clippings  in  the  Pulaski  scrapbook  also  indicate  pride  in  the
 
further  education  achievements  of  their  students.
 
PTAA  Students
 
Students  in  the  Saturday  schools  seem to  agree  on  why  they
 
attend,  at  least  at  first:
 "My  parents  made me,"  is  a frequent
 
comment.
 Giving  up  Saturday  leisure  time  activities,  and  having
 
an  extra  day of  school  and more homework  is  hard  for  the
 
students.
 Those  who  stick  with  it  either  "just  get  used  to  it"
 
and quit  fighting  the  inevitable,  or  really get  interested.
 But
 
the  parents'  motivation  is  often  the  deciding  factor.
 
Polish  school  is  a challenging  experience,  especially  in
 
high  school,  when  the  material  catches  up with  the  actual  age
 
group  and  students  use high  school  level  texts  from  Poland.
 
19
 
"Only the  dedicated and motivated  students  really  survive  and
 
go  through  high  school,"  says  one  school  administrator  of  the
 
Polish  high  school  graduates.
 "But  once  they  finish  you  really
 
can  converse  with  them  fluently ... they  have  good  knowledge  of
 
literature,  can  write  a good  paper."
 
Older  students  raise  two  different  reasons  for  attending  the
 
schools.
 One  group came  to  learn  Polish  language  in order  to
 
succeed  in  college or  career.  Other  students  who  had visited
 
relatives  in  Poland,  as  many had,  cited the  usefulness  and
 
satisfaction  of  being  able  to  speak  Polish with  family  and  get
 
around  in  another  country.
 
The  Future  of  the  Polish  Schools
 
The  Polish  schools  have  operated  primarily  within  their  own
 
communities.
 In  the  1980's,  however,  some  of  their  major
 
concerns  are  in  regard to  relationships  with  the  larger  society.
 
The  schools  would  like to  be  recognized by  the  Illinois  State
 
Board of  Education  so  that  their  students  would  receive  credit
 
for  their  achievements  in  Polish  language,  a move  that  would
 
benefit  students  in  all  ethnic  heritage  schools  in  the  state.
 
State  recognition  would greatly  aid  Polish  and  other  ethnic
 
schools  to  attract  and retain  students,  and  encourage  students  to
 
continue  into  the  ethnic  school  high  school  programs.
 
Polish  and  other  ethnic  schools  realize  that  they  are
 
20
 
helping  to  supply  a resource--bilingual  people--that  is  much  in
 
demand by government  and  business.  These  schools  help  to  fill  the
 
gap  left  by declining  foreign  language  study  in  American public
 
schools.
 Ethnic  school  officials,  teachers  and  parents  are
 
frustrated  that  recognition  of  their  efforts  is  coming  so  slowly.
 
Yet,  the  fact  that  the  issue  arises  at  all  is  an  indication
 
of  the  increasing  sophistication  and  fuller participation by
 
ethnic  communities  in  the  larger American  society.
 
Will  the  Polish  Saturday  schools  continue  to  serve  the
 
needs  of  Polonia?
 As  the  generation  that  founded  the  Polish
 
Saturday  schools  graduates  their  youngest  children  from high
 
school  in  the  early  1980's,  the  future  is  uncertain.
 
Third-  and  fourth-generation  Polish  American  families  have
 
not  strongly  supported the  Saturday  schools  in  the  past.  The
 
post-war  immigrants  perceive  the  attitudes  of  the most  recent
 
arrivals  towards  Polish  education  to  be  different  from  their  own.
 
Past  PTAA  President  Helena  Ziolkowska  expressed  it  this  way:
 
"People  who  came to  this  country  from  Europe  in  early  40's
 
and  50's  were  survivors  of  World War  II,  and  they  were very
 
patriotic.
 And  to  them  survival  meant  to  be  Polish  and to  keep
 
the  Polish  language  and  faith  and  traditions.. .If  these  people
 
were  able  to  transfer  their  motivations  and  feelings  to  the  next
 
generation,  then  these  children  have  children  now  and  they  send
 
2
1
 
them to  Polish  schools.
 
"But  not  all  of  them  succeeded.
 Some  of  the  children  went
 
to  Polish  schools  because  they had  to,  and once  they got
 
married,  sometimes  to  people  oof  different  nationlality,  they
 
didn't  pay  that  much  attention.. .But  people who  come  from  Poland
 
right  now  are  of  different  stock.. .Many  of  them  don't  feel  that
 
they  should  keep  the  Polish  tradition.
 Not  everybody but  quite
 
a big  percentage  assimilates  very  quickly.
 They  don't  talk
 
Polish  at  home.. .it's  very  sad...
 
"I  don't  feel  sorry  for  them,  I feel  sorry  for  their
 
children  because  they  end  up  not  knowing  anything  about
 
themselves.
 
Atd  this  i

 perhaps  the  most  important  contribution  of  the
 
oi±s
 ch
---'
at  it  helps  young  people to  develop  a positive
 
nse  of  self-identity  that  includes  being  Polish  American.
 
Being  ethnic  in  the  United  States  is  a pervasive part  of
 
American  society,  one  that  does  not  disappear  readily  even  over
 
several  generations.
 As  this  fact  becomes  more  widely  ack-
nowledged,  we  need  to  seek ways  to  help  people  accept  and  use
 
their  ethnic  identity positively.
 Polish  and other  ethnic
 
schools  provide  a useful  skill-knowledge  of  a foreign  language
 
--which  can  in  itself  be  a source  of  pride  and achievement.
 
But  we  are  also  struggling  with  the  problem of  having  thousands
 
22
 
of  Americans  go  through  life  coping  with  profound  ambivalence  and
 
self-doubt  because  they  have  been  told  that  "being  ethnic"  is  not
 
a positive  part  of  "being  American."
 Ethnic  schools  strengthen
 
the  fabric  of  American  life  if  they  are  helping  young  people  to
 
accept,  validate  and  integrate  their  varying  heritages  into  their
 
concepts  of  "being  American."

Polish Saturday Schools  in Chicago
 
by Nargy McClain
 
Patricia  Witkowski grew up in South Chicago,  a
 
neighborhood  on Chicago's far southeast side.
 From the
 
time she was  three,  Patricia made a fifty-mile  round  i
 
each week to  a neighborhood then known as the  "Poli
 
Triangle, "
 just northeast of downtown Chicago,  to a
 
Polish Saturday school.
 
Growing up in the 19 6 ø
,,  Patricia spoke Polish at home
 
and wore pigtails  "when it wasn't  'in'  to be ethnic.
" 
She
 
also attended parochial schools in predominantly Polish
 
parishes,  but there the Polish language was not encouraged.
 
The teachers were Felician sisters,  a Polish orde

taught in English and scolded in Polish.
 
Faced with Polish jokes and other images which
 
stressed the negative stereotype of the  "dumb Polak,
"  
Patricia easily felt defensive about being Polish.
 So
 
going to Polish Saturday school was worth the aggravation
 
of another day of school.
 Polish school counteracted the
 
negative stereotypes encountered elsewhere and provided
 
"a sense of history,  culture,  ethnic identity.

feeling that)  hey,  I belong to a group of people and
 
they are important."
 That feeling gave Patricia the

At the turn of the century,  when the great  waves of

area,  Poland did not exist  as a nation.

Isolated from Poland,  the Polish community evolved distinctive
 
Polish American traditions.
 A unique  "Chicago Polish"  dialect
 
arose as American-born children learned to speak the Polish
 
language based  on the various regional  dialects spoken by
 
their parents  and teachers.
 Immigrants arriving after World
 
War II were surprised to find many archaic words and
 
grammatical  constructions preserved in the speech of the
 
established Polis1
American community.

After World War 11/ thousands of new immigrants flooded
 
the country from the refugee camps of Europe.
 Thes.'new
 
arrivals were to have a profound impact on the nature of
 
Chicago Polonia.
 They came from a Poland briefly reunited
 
between the world wars,  and had been raised with  a strong
 
sense of Polish national identity.
 Now they were refugees who
 
could not return to Communist Poland.
 Their strong love
 
of country,  fueled by a sense of being disinherited,  gave rise
 
to a deep need to keep alive things Polish and to pass on to

History of Chicago's Polish Schools
 
Chicago' s Polish schools have their roots in the
 
upheavals of World War II.
 The founders of the Polish
 
Teachers Association  (PTAA)  and a great many of the
 
teachers and parents currently active in the Polish
 
schools were adults or young childr
n in Poland during
 
World War II
 After the war many Poles found themselves
 
•.n either Displaced Persons camps  (also known as DP,  or
 
refugee camps)  in Germany or in temporary camps in
 
England for those associated with the Polish army.
 
ate:
 During the war,  the Polish government in ,Exile
 
established itself in E
 g
 
the Polish Army fought
 
alongside the British Army: 
'
When the war ended the
 
Polish Army demobilized in
England.)

Personal  relationships formed in the camps  were
 
often  Longlasting,  carrying over to the immigrants'  new
 
homes.
 Polish  teachers who set up schools in the camps
 
later helped establish Polish Saturday schools  in the
 
countries where they finally settled;
 the United States,
 
England and Canada.
 Polish teachers'  organizations formed
 
in the camps were modeIs.Io
 later groups.
 
-
 
Under the Displaced Persons Act,  thousands of Polish
 
re±ug es came to the United States in the late  1940"s and
 
-
 
1950 V5  
Existing Polish American institutions met many
 
needs of the new arrivals,  but the parochial sc hoo ls,  
where the heritage of Poland's turn-of-the-century rural
 
traditions predominated,  could not.
 For Poles educated
 
in a united Poland between the two world wars,  knowledge
 
of the contemporary,  standard Polish language was an
 
important attribute of being Polish.
 They wanted their
 
children to speak the language well and learn Polish
 
history and national traditions in a more structured way
 
than the home could provide.
 The parochial schools could
 
not teach modern Polish nor insti11  t4
 contemporary
 
sense of Polish national identity.
 
So while many new immigrants sent their children tc
 
paroch
 schools for their regular education,  they also
 
began to create special Polish schools.  In the  1950 s,  as
 
Polish cultural education in parochial schools dec\ '

the Polish Saturday schools emerged.

Case Study:
 General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
General  Casimir Pulaski Polish School offers
 
classes from first grade through high school.
 It is one
 
of four Polish high schools fed by the more numerous
 
Polish grammar schools in the Chicago area.
 In Polish,  its
 
name is Polska skola im.  Gen.  K.

attests to the strength of the need it met.

beginnings with 200 students in 1954 it grew to

 In 1970

students attended.
 As families left the Pç 'ish Triangle,
 
many Pulaski students went to the nbwly-' ormed,  smaller
 
schools in other neighborhoods and suburbs.
 In 1981-82
 
50 students were enrolled in the school's twelve grades.

 They felt that

better than trying to teach such subjects at home.
 The
 
relative importance of these factors varies,  of course,
 
from family to family,  as does the commitment to speaking
 
Polish at home and to helping children with Polish-s

 One of the high school teachers,
 
Dr.  Janina Kras,  holds a Ph. D.  from Jagellonian
 
University in Krakow,  Poland's oldest and most-respected
 
institution of higher learning.
 
Because Polish language skills are the heart of
 
Pulaski's mission,  the school seeks teachers who have
 
recently come from Poland and know the most up-to--date
 
language.
 The school is aware that languages change,  and

 Thus continuing the
 
European tradition of classroom discipline is one of the
 
goals of Pulaski School.
 Classes are quiet and students

 Teachers remain

The Polish American community has several  large
 
fraternal organizations which help to support various
 
community cultural efforts.
 Some Polish schools have
 
chosen to affiliate with these organizations,  such as the
 
Polish National Alliance or the Polish Roman Catholic
 
Union,  which then contribute to the school's maintenance.
 
Other schools feel that the resulting financial  support
 
also means
 giving up some decision-making powers

addresses the shared concerns of the Polish schools in the
 
Chicago area' s fifteen-schdol network.
 One of the most
 
pressing issues is the unique curriculum needs of ethnic
 
schools.
 Language and other texts developed for use in
 
the home country do not relate to the experience of
 
children growing up in the United States,  while  books
 
developed for students with no knowledge of a
.
. .
rãnguage are
 
76
 
inapprrpriate for children who speak the language at home.
 
1 7Therefore,.
 n 
­ ic schools are forced to adapt books which
 
are not suited to their needs or to write new ones.
 
For many  years individual teachers in the Polish
 
Saturday schools had to resolve the problem of  teaching
 
materials on their own.
 Some were remarkably successful.

A seventeen-year veteran teacher at Pulaski sigh Schooi,

Mrs.  Maria Neumann,  proudly opened a closet door

The Future of  the Polish Saturday Schools
 
The Polish schools serve primarily their own ethnic
 
community.
 In the leaø's,  however,  one of their major
 
concerns is their relationship with the larger society.
 
The schools would like to be recognized by the  Illinois
 
State Board of Education so that their students  would
 
receive credit  for their achievements in a second language.
 
State recognition would be a great help to Polish and other
 
ethnic schools in attracting and keeping students.
 
Polish and other ethnic schools realize that they are
 
helping to supply a resource--bilingual people--that is
 
much in demand by government and business.
 Thes,, 4choo1s
 
help to fill the gap left by declining foreign-
anguage
 
education in American schools.
 Ethnic school  officials,
 
teachers and parents are frustrated that recognition of
 
their ef±
rts  is coming so slowly.
 Several proposals to
 
the State Board of Education over the past ten years have
 
been rejected.
 Yet,, t
 c
 a
 -
he issue arises at all
 
is an indication .±{ethnic communities'  increasing
 
willingness to make a public case for recognition of their
 
contributions to the larger American society.
 
Will the Polish Saturday schools continue to serve
 
the needs of Polonia?
 As the generation that founded the
 
Polish Saturday schools graduates their youngest children
 
from high school in the early  1980's,  the fuEure is
 
uncertain.
 Third- and fourth-generation Polish American
 
families have not st ongly- -supparted the Saturday schools
 
the-p
.'.
 4
'/although there are signi
f
icant  numbers of
 
more recent  immigrants from-Poland
 post-war  immigrants
 
perceive the attitudes of thes
.e.-recent arrivals  toward
 
Polish education to be different from their own.
 As
 
PTAA ,
President  Helena Ziolkowska noted:
 
"People  who came to this country from Europe in
 
the early
 4Os and  '50s  were survivors of  World
 
War II,  and they were very patriotic.
 And  to them
 
survival  meant to be Polish and to keep the Polish
 
language and faith and traditions.
.
.
.  If these people
 
were able' to trans.f r their motivations and feelings
 
to the next generation,  then these children have
 
children  now and they send them to Polish  schools.
 
But not  all of them succeeded.
 Some of the  child-
went to  Polish schools because they had to,  and
 
once they got married,  sometimes to people  of
 
different  nationality,  they didn't pay that  much
 
attention.
 
en
 
But people who come from Poland  right now  are of
 
different  stock..
.
.  Many of them don't feel  that they
 
should keep up the Polish tradition.
 Not  everybody,
 
but quite  a big percentage,  assimilates ye y
 
quickly.
 They don't talk Polish at home  .  .. it's
 
very sad. .  .  .1 don't feel sorry for them,  I feel
 
sorry for their children,  because they end up not
 
knowing anything about themselves.
 
I have a duty to give what  I received to the next
 
z3
 
2
 
generation.
 Language,  culture,  history,  tradition,
 
national  pride enrich your life.
 But more than that,
 
if you know who you are and where you come from,  you
 
know what  you're worth.
 
Conclusions
 
Perhaps  the most  important contribution of  the Polish
 
schools is that they help young people develop  a positive
 
sense of self-identity that  includes being Polish -
 
American.
 Being ethnic in the United States  is  a
 
pervasive part  of American society,  one that does not
 
disappear readily even over several generations.
 As this
 
fact becomes more widely acknowledged,  we need to seek
 
-
- -
ways to help people accept
id use their ethnic  identity
 
positively.
 Polish and other ethnic schools provide a
 
useful skill--knowledge of a second language--which can
 
in itself,/be a source of pride and achievement.
 B
.
.u-t' we "
 
are also sjruggling
 with the problem of having thousa
s
 
of Americans go through life coping with profound
 
ambivalence and self-doubt  because they have been told
 
that  "being ethnic"  is not  a positive part of  "being
 
-
 
American
 Ethnic schools strengthen the fabric of
 
American -
life as they help young people to accept,
 
validate,  and integrate their varying heritages  into
 
their concepts  of being American.
 
Acknowledgements
 
I extend  my deep appreciation to the Polish Teachers
 
Association in America,  Inc.  and its staff,  and to General
 
Patricia Witkowski grew up in South Chicago, a neighborhood on
 
Chicago's far southeast side. From the time she was three Patricia made
 
a fifty -mile round trip once a week to a neighborhood then known as the
 
"Polish Triangle, - northeast of downtown Chicago,  to attend a Polish
 
Saturday school
 
Patricia grew up speaking Polish at home.  She also attended
 
parochial schools in predominantly Polish parishes, where  the Polisn
 
language was not encouraged. Growing up in the  1
960s,  she was speaking
 
Polish and wearing pigtails "when it wasn't  'in'  to be ethnic."
 
Faced with countless messages and images which stressed the
 
negative stereotype of the "dumb Polack," Patricia easily felt
 
defensive about being Polish.  So going to Polish Saturday school was
 
1
worth 
I
the aggravation •
counteracted the negative stereotypes encountered elsewhere and
 
Alliance
 
provided "a sense of history,  culture, ethnic identity . . . [and the
 
feeling that] hey,  I belong to a group of people and they are
 
important." That feeling gave Patricia the �onfidence to deal with the
 
problem of "being different" that seemed to bother friends who had not
 
been given a strong sense of Polish identity.

translator). She values her fluency in the Polish language, a
 
noteworthy accomplishment for someone raised in the United States. But
 
more than anything else, she says, Polish Saturday school nourished a
 
sense of self-worth as a Polish American.
 
Witold Pawlikowski was just a small boy in 1
939 when the Soviet
 
Union invaded Poland and occupied his hometown. His father disappeared
 
without a t
race, and the r
est of the family was deported t
o Siberia.
 
After many months of great hardship some young Polish men were
 
recruited out of the Siberian camps to join the Polish army;  they t
ook
 
they families with them. In this way the Pawlikowski family reached the
 
Middle East. After the war they joined the demobilized Polish Army in
 
England. They later emigrated to the United States, where Witold served
 
in the U.S. Army. He settled in Chicago in 1
957. There he completed his
 
education as an engineer.
 
Because of his childhood experiences Mr. Pawlikowski felt
 
strongly that his child should know her Polish heritage of language,
 
history, and traditions. He wanted her to speak the language at home
 
and to know Polish grammar and read Polish literature. He and his wife
 
Yolanthe, the daughter of two teachers who take an active part in
 
Chicago's Polish Saturday schools, cajoled and supported their daughter
 
through twelve years of Polish school. Beata Pawlikowski is a graduate
 
of the General Casimir Pulaski Polish School.

The Witkowski and Pawlikowski families are members of Chicago
 
Polonia, a strong ethnic community. They and many like them in
 
Chicago's diverse ethnic groups feel compelled to retain and pass on to
 
their children the traditions, values, and symbols that are part of
 
their ethnic identity.
 
Chicago ethnic groups educate their children a
s ethnic Americans
 
in many ways, from family training to church activities,  lodge events,
 
and formal ethnic schooling. Ethnic-heritage schools are found i
n a
 
least twenty Chicago communities, and perhaps many more. Chicago
 
Polonia, one of the largest ethnic groups in the area, claims o
ver
 
750,000 people of Polish descent and supports a network of fifteen
 
Polish Saturday schools.
 
The Saturday schools supported by Chicago Polonia are coordinated
 
by an umbrella organization of professional Polish educators, the
 
Polish Teachers Association in America, Inc. (PTAA). The schools,
 
generally called Polish language schools or Polish Saturday schools,
 
meet on Saturdays and offer instruction in Polish language and history
 
for students from kindergarten through high school. Polish high school
 
graduates speak Polish fluently and have a command of the written
 
language, literary traditions, and Polish history. Students also gain a
 
sense of confidence and pride in being Polish American. Maintaining
 
these schools is a community effort which requires a great deal of
 
energy.

Early Polish Education in Chicago
 
At the turn of the century, when the great wave o
f immigration
 
brought thousands of Poles to the Chicago area, Poland did not exist as
 
a nation. Poland had been partitioned in 1
795 among Russia, Prussia,
 
and Austria, and ethnic Poles referred t
o themselves as "Russian
 
Poles," or "Austrian Poles." They often clung to their Roman Catholic
 
religion as an important ethnic marker.
 
Language, ethnicity, regional origin, and religion, rather t
han
 
nationality, were the distinctive characteristics of this early group
 
of Polish immigrants. They were mostly peasants with l
ittle formal
 
education, who came to the United States for economic reasons, working
 
hard so that their children might struggle up the ladder of success in
 
America. Part of that struggle was educational, and education for many
 
of these children/
 began in Polish parochial schools.
 
Poles in Chicago sought to establish Catholic parishes that were
 
Polish in character. They built many churches and established schools
 
with them.  In the parish schools, where many or nearly all of the
 
students came from Polish—speaking homes and the teaching nuns also
 
spoke Polish, the Polish language was part of the curriculum almost
 
more by default than by design. Each school was free to determine its
 
own use of the Polish language, and schools seem to have varied widely;
 
depending on the school or even the individual teacher, students might
 
study only religious subjects or most of the curriculum in Polish. The
 
Polish Instruction ia the parish schools seems to have ste
ed from the
 
5
 
fact that the teachers and s
tudents were all of Polish descent, r
ather
 
than from an explicit desire to impart to students a mastery of the
 
Polish language or a need to instill articulated values related to the
 
traditions o
f Poland.
 
Polish instruction in parochial schools began to decline in t
he
 
1
930s, although it persisted for another twenty years. During the
 
Depression pressures from the Archdiocese (historically dominated by
 
Irish and German clerics hostile to parishes that clung to an ethnic
 
interpretation of Catholicism) to r
id the parishes of "
foreign"
 
association and a general pressure on immigrants t
o assimilate
 
contributed to the decline.
 
Polish immigration to Chicago was halted in the 1
920s by
 
restrictive United States immigration laws. Isolated from Poland for
 
almost thirty years, the Polish community evolved their own
 
Polish-American traditions. "Chicago Polish" arose as American-born
 
children learned to speak the Polish language based on the various
 
regional dialects spoken by their parents and teachers. Immigrants
 
arriving after World War II were surprised to find many "ar
 
and grammatical constructions preserved in the speech of th€
 
established Polish -American community.
 
The thousands of new immigrants who flooded the country from the
 
refugee camps of Europe were to have a profound impact on the nature of
 
Chicago Polonia. The new refugees coming from a Poland briefly reunited
 
between the
, world wars had been iaised with intense feelings of Polish
 
6
 
nationalism. These feeling were reinforced by the knowledge that they
 
could not go back to Poland. They felt disinherited, which engendered a
 
deep need to keep alive things Polish and to pass on t
o their children
 
raised in the United States pride and knowledge o
f what it means t
o be
 
Polish.
 
Many o
f the new refugees were educated professionals. For them
 
knowledge of the contemporary, standard Polish language was an imprtant
 
attribute of being Polish. They wanted their children to speak the
 
language and learn Polish history and national traditions in a more
 
structured way than they could provide in the home. Their symbols a
t
 
being Polish differed markedly from those of the established
 
Polish-American community.
 
There arose a need for a new kind of Polish education not supplied
 
in the parochial schools. Many of the new arrivals sent their children
 
to Polish parochial schools for their regular education, but they also
 
felt a need to create special Polish schools that concentrated on
 
Polish education. In the 1950s, as Polish cultural education in
 
parochial schools declined,  the Polish Saturday schools emerged.
 
History of Chicago's Polish Saturday Schools
 
World War II influenced the development of the Chicago's Polish
 
Saturday schools. The founders of the Polish Teachers Association in
 
America
 
PTAA)• and a great many o
l the teachers and parents currently
 
7
 
active in the Polish schools were adults or young children in Poland
 
during World War II. After the war many Poles found themselves in
 
either in Displaced Persons Camps (also known as "DP" or refugee camps)
 
in Germany or in temporary camps in England for those associated with
 
the Polish Army.1  Schools were set up by Polish teachers in both the
 
German and English camps. The premise of the schools in Germany was
 
that the children would b
e r
eturning to Poland, so the regular Polish
 
curriculum was used. In England a sort of bilingual school system
 
developed, so that students could continue their studies in either
 
English or Polish universities; Polish language, culture, and history
 
were taught in Polish and all other subjects in English. That division
 
of curriculum influenced the Saturday schools —in Chicago students
 
attend parochial or public schools for their  regular  education and
 
Polish school for  Polish  subjects.
 
Many teachers who worked in the camp schools later helped
 
establish Polish Saturday schools in the countries where they settled:
 
the United States, England, Canada, Australia, and Argentina. Polish
 
teachers' organizations formed in the camps were models for later
 
groups. Relationships formed in the camps were also often longlasting,
 
carrying over to the immigrants'  new homes.
 
Many Poles made their way to the United States when the Displaced
 
Persons Commission of Congress opened the way in 1948. Thousands
 
settled in Chicago during the late 1940s and 1
950s. Many of their needs
 
1During the wa0r the Polish Gover
ent in Exile established itself in
 
England; the Pu sh Army fought with the British Army  When the war
 
ended the Polish Army demobilized in England.
 
8
 
were met in Chicago by existing Polish churches and other social and
 
fraternal organizations. The new arrivals soon began to develop
 
supplemental Polish cultural programs, however, both for adults and for
 
the children.
 
Two Saturday schools emerged in the early 1
950s: General Casimir
 
Pulaski Polish School and Thadeusz Kosciuzko Polish School. Both are
 
still in operation, o
ffering a program of Polish education through the
 
high—school level. The schools met in the Polish Triangle, where
 
Ashland, Division, and Milwaukee Avenues meet on the near northwest
 
side of Chicago, until the early 1970s. They served thousands of
 
students; Pulaski, for example, had 1
,000 students in 1
970s. The
 
neighborhood changed fundamentally with the John F
. Kennedy Expressway,
 
however. Chicago Polonja saved two magnificent Polish churches from
 
being razed, but the character of the neighborhood did not survive. The
 
city built low—incnne housing and Polish residents began to move out.
 
The neighborhood is now primarily Hispanic, although some Poli
 
churches, organizations, and businesses remain. New immigrants from
 
Poland do settle in the neighborhood, but many find it more comfortable
 
further north on Milwaukee Avenue. As families moved out of  the old
 
neighborhood, it became increasingly difficult for students to attend
 
Saturday school there. Some families had reservations about safety in
 
the area. Enrollment soon dropped.
 
The significant numbers of Polish families settling in new
 
communities, mostly in the far northwest Chicago neighborhoods and in
 
the_ northwest . and western suburbs  necessitated the founding of new
 
9
 
Polish schools.  In the late 1960s
. schools were established in
 
Hammond, Indiana (
just across the Indiana-Illinois state line from
 
Chicago) and in Cicero, Illinois, a suburb just west of Chicago. Nine
 
new schools were opened during the 1970s, and two new Chicago-area
 
schools have started since 1
9 U.
 
In 1
980 Polish Saturday schools enrolled around 2
,0UU students.
 
Enrollment had increased to 3,000 by 1981-1982. The steady growth of
 
newer, smaller schools may have contributed to the increase. PTAA
 
administrators suggested two other factors that may have influenced the
 
marked growth in enrollment:  the election of a Polish Pope and the
 
struggle of the Solidarity Union in Poland, which has generated
 
worldwide public support and sympathy.
 
All Polish schools are named for famous Poles, underscoring the
 
independent, national orientation of the schools. The two earliest
 
schools were named for the first well known Polish
 
Americans —
Revolutionary War generals Casimir Pulaski and Thadeusz
 
Kosciuzko. Other schools are named after popular figures from World War
 
II, such as St. Maksymilian Kolbe and General Anders. Copernicus,
 
Paderewski, Sienkiewicz, and Chopin schools are named for famous
 
scientists and artists, while Maria Konopnicka School commemorates a
 
much-loved poet. The names of the St. Maksymilian and Pope John Paul II
 
schools (there are several named after the Pope) definitely have
 
Polish rather than religious significance;  there are no schools named
 
for other saints or popes.

Case Study: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
General Casimir Pulaski Polish School offers classes from first
 
grade through high school. I
t is one of the four Polish high schools
 
fed by the more numerous Polish grammar schools in the Chicago area.
 
Pulaski School met in various locations in the Polish Triangle
 
from the early 1950s until 1978. It then moved t- - - - - and presently
 
uses the S
t. Wenceslaus Roman Catholic parish school building located
 
at 3415 North Lawndale S
-e-r€et(2- ' ie school grew rapidly,  from 200
 
students in 1
954 to 850 in 1
961 (when high school classes formed) and
 
1
,000 in 1970 (
just before the dispersal of the schools?).  In 1
981-1982
 
350 students were enrolled.
 
The parish school hail in the basement of the building is used for
 
school assemblies and as a parents' waiting room; the classrooms are on
 
the two upper floors. On a regular Saturday school day there are
 
usually several parents in the hail helping with school business,
 
visitng, or reading the paper. Coffee and homemade pastries such as
 
ponczki —round pieces of dough which are fried, glazed, and sometimes
 
filled with jelly —are available.
 
Ten classes meet in the morning and in the afternoon. First
 
through eighth grades all meet duirng both the morning and afternoon
 
sessions. In addition, two of the high school classes meet before noon
 
1
1
 
and two meet in the afternnon. Students who participate in
 
extracurricular activities, such as singing, poetry recitation, and
 
dancing, either stay late or come earlier than their class sessions.
 
Classes and Curriculum: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
The primary goal of the school i
s t
o teach the Polish language. To
 
this end, all grades stress language skills and all classes are
 
conducted entirely in Polish. In first through third grade reading and
 
writing are the main subjects. Some Polish history and traditions are
 
introduced, primarily through legends and stories told to the class.
 
Polish-language skills are stressed in the intermediate grades, along
 
with literature. Polish history and geography are taught as separate
 
subjects. The high school grades emphasize the study of Polish
 
literature and history.
 
Although all of the students speak some Polish, command of the
 
language varies greatly. Everyone acknowledges that the students are
 
all most comfortable speaking English. One first-grade teacher felt
 
that she essentially presents Polish as a second language. If students
 
persist with Polish studies, however, and graduate from a Polish high
 
school, they are expected to speak and read Polish fluently, and be
 
able to write well. The high school classes cover high-school level
 
material in Polish. The school is particularly proud of its high-school
 
level graduates.
 
1
2
 
Discipline is one theme stressed by parents, teachers, and school
 
officials. In Polish and other European educational systems maintaining
 
a certain distance between teacher and students is traditionally part
 
of the way students express respect for the teacher. Continuing that
 
tradition i
s one of the goals of the Pulaski School. Classes are quiet
 
and students stand by their desks to respond. Teachers remain
 
affectionate towards the youngest students, however, and cordial with
 
older pupils.
 
Teachers: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
Teachers at the Pulaski School range from young, recent
 
immigrants, like - --
-
--to Mrs. Zurczak, who celebrated her fiftieth
 
year of teaching in 1982. Only the first grade teacher, Mrs. Helena
 
Sromek, holds both Polish and American teaching credentials. One of '
 
high school teachers, Dr. Janina Kras, holds a Ph.D. from Jagellonian
 
University, Poland's oldest and most—respected institution of higher
 
education.
 
School Administration: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
Like each school in the network, Pulaski maintains its own
 
independent school administration. A Parent Teacher Association (
PTA)
 
elects tbe
-achool board. Tuition c'overs the majority of school
 
1

expenses, with the remaining funds coining from contributions by Polish
 
organizations (channeled through the PTAA) and fund—raising efforts by
 
parents. Parents are very active in running the school. They serve on
 
the school board, sew costumes for school presentations, and bake for
 
the yearly fund—raiser.
 
Some Polish schools have chosen t
o affiliate with other Polish
 
charitable organizations, such as the Polish National Alliance or the
 
Polish Roman Catholic Union, which then help to support the school.
 
Pulaski School,  like the majority of Polish schools, has chosen to
 
r
emain unaffiliated to maintain full control over school affairs.
 
School Administration: Polish Saturday Schools
 
Each Polish school makes its own arrangements for housing, usually
 
renting from a parochial school, negotiates rent, and determines
 
teacher salaries. With fifteen schools in the network, arrangements are
 
quite diverse, reflecting the economic situation of school parents and
 
the support offered by the parish, among other factors.
 
The PTAA addresses the shared concerns of the schools. One major
 
concern is the unique curriculum needs of ethnic schools. Language and
 
other texts developed for use in the home country to do not relate to
 
the experience of children growing up in the United States, while books
 
developed for students with no knowledge of a language are
 
1
4
 
inappropriate for children who speak the language at home. Therefore,
 
ethnic schools are forced t
o adapt books which are not suited t
o their
 
needs or t
o write new ones.
 
For many years individual teachers in the Polish Saturday schools
 
tried to resolve the problem of acquiring useful teaching materials as
 
best they could.  In the mid-1960s the PTAA began to sponsor the
 
development of appropriate texts. Their first project was Polska Mowa
  
(The Polish Language), an introduction to the Polish language for older
 
children and adults. Now in i
ts eighth edition, Polska Mowa is used
 
not only in Polish Saturday schools in the United States, Canada,
 
England, and Australia, but in college and high school Polish language
 
classes.
 
Later projects focused on developing readers in literature and
 
history for elementary and junior high school grades. High school
 
classes can often use high school literature texts from Poland. History
 
texts, however, are a very sensitive subject, since texts from Poland
 
written since th
'e Communist takeover are considered unacceptable. With
 
this in mind, the PTAA developed a four—volume History of Poland.
 
Texts are also exchanged with Polish schools in other countries where
 
similar curriculum—development efforts have taken place.
 
As many new Polish schools opened in the 1970s, the PTAA also saw
 
the need for a standardized curriculum, to aid teachers and allow
 
students to move more easily between schools if they needed to. The
 
PTAA has  established guidelines for the types of classes to be of
 fere4:
 
1
5
 
kindergarten; eight years of elementary school for Polish-speaking
 
children; four years of high school for Polish-speaking children;
 
classes for children who do not speak Polish; and a singing, music,
 
dance, and theater program. Detailed curriculum guidelines for each
 
year are being developed. The PTAA's e
fforts to develop appropriate
 
texts and standardized curriculum reflects their desire to create an
 
educational experience through which students really master the
 
language, rather than just having the opportunity t
o spend time in a
 
Polish-oriented environment.
 
The PTAA also provides other services which b
enefit all of the
 
schools. The group functions as a professional organization for all
 
teachers of Polish descent, even those not teaching in Polish schools.
 
The PTAA sponsors activities to promote Polish-language teachin
 
notably popular essay and poetry recitation contests. In 1
982 a
 
recitation contest;'attracted enthusiastic participation from 800
 
students from Polish Saturday schools, public and private high school
 
Polish classes, and area colleges. The PTAA also exchanges reports and
 
textbooks with similar teachers' organizations in Canada and England.
 
The PTAA offers a small lending library of teaching aids t
o the
 
Polish Saturday schools, including pictures, slide-tape programs, and
 
equipment. In addition, the organization supports the activities of
 
many of the other Chicago-area Polish institutions. Polish
 
organizations and individual Poles contribute in turn to the PTAA.
 
Funds from a major annual fund-raiser--the Day of Polish Schools
 
Picnic —are channeled by the PTAA'to the many Polish schools.

Teachers: Polish Saturday Schools
 
Ninety percent of the teachers in the Polish Saturday schools were
 
born and educated in Poland; most hold specialized teaching certifcates
 
or advanced degrees. In Poland teaching is a highly respected i
f poorly
 
paid profession. Many of the teachers in Chicago find themselves unable
 
to teach in American schools and must take other jobs to support
 
themselves. Being unable t
o work in their profession is a blow to their
 
self-esteem, so immigrant teachers seek out the Polish schools. There
 
they can be themselves; some say that they only feel like people on
 
Saturdays. Others teach because they feel strongly that they should not
 
waste specialized training and talents. In addition, some younger women
 
at home with small children find Saturday school a convenient part-time
 
job.
 
Personal motivation must be high to keep teachers in the schools.
 
The salaries of
ten have not covered much more than the cost of gas ad
 
childcare. One/ teacher noted that during the 1
960s she worked for $6 a
 
day and paid her babysitter $10. Salaries now range from $6 to $10 per
 
hour.
 
Teachers range in age from 25 to 70. The many younger, newly
 
arrived teachers help to keep contemporary Polish language in the
 
schools. Those raised in the United States, who are native speakers of
 
English and Polish, teach the classes for English speakers.
 
1
7
 
The PTAA is very concerned about upholding standards and verifies
 
the credentials of teachers who apply for positions. The organization
 
sponsors teacher-training and in-service seminars, and has co-sponsored
 
courses to help new arrivals qualify for American teaching credentials.
 
Parents: Polish Saturday Schools
 
Parents are the core of the Polish schools. Post-war immigrant
 
parents wanted their Polish-speaking children to become literate in
 
Polish and to know Polish history and culture. They felt that
 
establishing a formal educational environment would be better than
 
trying to teach such subjects at home. The relative importance of these
 
factors varies, of course, from family to family, as does the
 
commitment to speaking Polish at home and to helping children with
 
Polish-school homework.
 
Parents who send their children to Polish school pay a small
 
tuition fee. They also often make a considerable sacrifice of time and
 
effort, giving up their only free day for shopping and errands. Getting
 
the children to the school requires dedication and motivation when it
 
may be as much as a 60-mile round trip for suburban residents. (The
 
schools recognize these difficulties. At the 1982 Pulaski High School
 
graduation banquet a young woman who lived in a distant suburb received
 
18
 
a special award for perfect attendance.) Parents also support the
 
school through volunteer activities and attend special programs at the
 
school at Christmas and Easter.
 
The high priority set on education in Polish school families i
s
 
reflected in their desire t
o send their children to college. Clippings
 
in the Pulaski school's scrapbook attest to its pride in the
 
higher-education achievements of the students.
 
Students: Polish Saturday Schools
 
Students in the Saturday schools seem to agree on why they
 
attend, at least initially. "My parents made me" is a frequent comment.
 
Giving up Saturday'
 leisure-time activities, having an extra day of
 
school, and being expected to complete more homework is hard for the
 
students. Those who stick with it either "
just get used to it" and quit
 
fighting the inevitable, or really get interested. The parents'
 
motivation is often the deciding factor.
 
Polish school is a challenging experience, especially in high
 
school, when the material catches up with the actual age group and
 
students use high-school-level texts from Poland. "Only the dedicated
 
and motivated students really survive and go through high school," says
 
1
9
 
one school administrator of the Polish high school graduates. "But once
 
they finish you really can converse with them fluently .
 .
 .
 they have
 
good knowledge of literature, and write a good paper.
 
Older students raise two different reasons for attending the
 
schools. One group attended to learn the Polish language to enhance
 
their success in college or in a career. Other students who had visited
 
relatives in Poland, as many had, cited the usefulness and satisfaction
 
of being able to speak Polish with their family and get around in
 
another country.
 
The Future of the Polish Saturday Schools
 
The Polish schools have operated primarily within their own
 
communities. In thL 1980s, however, one of their major concerns is
 
their relationship with the larger society. The schools would like to
 
be recognized by the Illinois State Board of Education so that their
 
students would receive credit for their achievements in the Polish
 
language, a circumstance that would benefit students in all ethnic
 
heritage schools in the state. State recognition would greatly aid
 
Polish and other ethnic schools in attracting and retaining students.
 
It would also encourage students to continue through the high school
 
programs offered by the ethnic schools.
 
20
 
Polish and other ethnic schools realize that they are helping to
 
supply a resource —bilingual people —that is much in demand by
 
government and business. These schools help to fill the gap left by
 
declining foreign-language education in American schools. Ethnic school
 
officials, teachers, and parents are frustrated that recognition of
 
their efforts is coming so slowly. Yet, the fact that the issue arises
 
at all i
s an indication of the increasing sophistication and
 
participation by ethnic communities in the larger American society.
 
Will the Polish Saturday schools continue to serve the needs of
 
Polonia? As the generation that founded the Polish Saturday schools
 
graduates their youngest children from high school in the early 1
980s,
 
the future i
s uncertain. Third- and fourth-generation Polish-American
 
families have not strongly supported the Saturday schools in the past.
 
The post-war immigrants perceive the attitudes of the most recent
 
arrivals towards P lish education to be different from their own. As
 
past PTAA President Helena Ziolkowska says:
 
People who came to this country from Europe in the
 
early '40s and '50s were survivors of World War II, and
 
they were very patriotic. And to them survival meant to
 
be Polish and to keep the Polish language and faith and
 
traditions .
 .
 .
 .  If these people were able to
 
transfer their motivations and feelings to the next
 
generation, then these children have children now and
 
they send them to Polish schools. But not all of them
 
succeeded. Some of the children went to Po l
ish schools
 
because they had to, and once  they go t married,
 
sometimes to people of different nationality, they
 
didn't pay that much attention .
 .
 
But people who come from Poland right now are of
 
different stock .
 .
 .
 .  Many of then don't feel that
 
they. should keep the Polish. tradition, .
 Not everybody,
 
but quite a big percentage, assimilates very quickly.
 
They don't talk Polish at home .
 .
 .  it's very sad
 
2

•
 .
 I don't feel sorry for them, I feel sorry for their
 
children, because they end up not knowing anything
 
about themselves.
 
Conclusions
 
Perhaps the most important contribution of the Polish schools i
s
 
that they help young people develop a positive sense of self-identity,
 
which includes being Polish American. Being ethnic in the United States
 
i
s a pervasive part of American society, one that does not disappear
 
readily even over several generations. As this fact becomes more widely
 
acknowledged, we need to seek ways to help people accept and use their
 
ethnic identity positively. Polish and other ethnic schools provide a
 
useful skill —knowledge of a foreign language----which can  in  it
sell
.  cc  a
 
source of pride and achievement. But we are also struggling wi tc
i  t
 
problem of having thousands of Americans who go through life coping
 
with profound ambivalence and self-doubt because they have been told
 
that "being ethnic" is not a positive part of "being American." Ethnic
 
schools strengthen the fabric of American life if they help young
 
people to accept, validate, and integrate their varying heritages into
 
their concepts of being American.

Polish Saturday Schools in Chicago
 
by Margy McClain
 
Patricia Witkowski grew up in South Chicago,  a
 
neighborhood on Chicago's far southeast side.
 From the
 
time she was three,  Patricia made a fifty-mile round trip
 
each week to a neighborhood then known as the  "Polish
 
Triangle, •  just northeast of downtown Chicago,  to attend
 
Polish Saturday school.
 
Growing up in the I960's,  Patricia spoke Polish at home
 
and wore pigtails  "when it wasn't  'in'  to be ethnic.
 She
 
also attended parochial schools in predominantly Polish
 
parishes,  but there the Polish language was not encouraged.
 
The teachers were Felician sisters,  a Polish order,  who
 
taught in English and scolded in Polish.
 
Faced with Polish jokes and other images which
 
stressed the negative stereotype of the  "dumb Polak,
 
Patricia easily felt defensive about being Polish.
 So
 
going to Polish Saturday school was worth the aggravation
 
of another day of school.
 Polish school counteracted the
 
negative stereotypes encountered elsewhere and provided
 
"a Sense of history,  culture,  ethnic identity
—land the
 
feeling that]  hey,  I belong to a group of people and
 
they are important."
 That 'e,ling gave Patricia t
 
confidence to deal with the problem of  "being different"
 
that seemed to bother friends who had not been given a
 
I
 
strong sense of Polish Identity.
 
Patricia has been active through the years in various
 
Polish organizations,  serving at times as Polish-language
 
secretary.
 She values her fluency in the Polish language,
 
achieved through twelve years of Polish Saturday School
 
study and a noteworthy accomplishment for someone raised in
 
the United States.
 But more than anything else,  she says,
 
Polish Saturday School nourished her sense of self-worth as
 
a Polish American.
 
Witold Pawlikovaki was just a small boy in 1939 when
 
the Soviet Union invaded Poland and occupied his hometown.
 
His father disappeared without a trace,  and the rest of the
 
family was deported to Siberia.  After great hardships,  the
 
Pawlikovakis and other Polish military families were sent to
 
Iran.
 After the War they eventually made their way to
 
England,  where the Polish Government in Exile had spent the
 
war,  and then to the United States.
 Witold served in the
 
U. S.  Army,  then settled in Chicago in 1957 and completed his
 
engineering education.
 
Because of his childhood experiences of uprooting and
 
loss,  Mr.  Pawlikovaki felt strongly that his child should have
 
a good education --'the one thing that can't be taken away
 
from you'--and that she should know her Polish heritage of
 
language,  history,  and traditions.
 He wanted her to speak the
 
language at home and to know Polish grammar and read Polish
 
literature.
 He and his wife Yolantha,  the daughter of two
 
teachers who take an active part in Chicago's Polish Saturday
 
schools,  cajoled and supported their daughter through twelve
 
years of Polish Saturday school.
 Like Patricia Witkowski,
 
Beata Pawlikowaki is a graduate of the General Casimir Pulaski
 
Polish High School.
 
The Witkov kj and Pawlikovaki families are members of
 
Chicago's strong Polish American community,  or
 1Polonja,
 as
 
Polish communities outside Poland term themselves.
 They and
 
many like them in Chicago's diverse ethnic groups passionately
 
desire to pass on to their children the traditions,  values and
 
symbols of their ethnic identity which have shaped their own
 
lives.
 
Chicago ethnic communities educate their children as
 
ethnic Americans in many ways,  from family training to
 
church activities,  lodge events and formal ethnic
 
schooling.
 Ethnic heritage schools are found in at lea t
 
twenty of Chicago's eighty-plus ethnic groups,  and
 
perhaps many more.
 Chicago Polonia,  one of the largest
 
ethnic groups in the area,  claims over 750, 000 people of
 
Polish descent,  and in 1982 sUppported a network of
 
fifteen Polish Saturday Schools.
 
An umbrella organization of professional Polish
 
educators,  the Polish Teachers Association in America,  Inc.
 
coordinates the Saturday school, network.
 The schools are
 
generally referred to as Polish language schools or Polish
 
Saturdays schools,  (or,  more informally,  simply as
 Polish
 
school").
 They meet Saturdays and offer instruction in Polish
 
language and history for students from kindergarten through
 
high school.
 Polish high school graduates speak Polish
 
fluently and have a command of the written language and
 
literary traditions,  as well as  Polish history.
 Students also
 
gain a sense of confidence and pride in being Polish America .
 
Maintaining these schools is a community effort accomplished
 
with relatively little money and a great deal of energy.
 Over
 
and over again,  teachers and parents testified that these
 
efforts are a labor of love,  one of absolute importance to
 
those involved.
 
Early Polish Education in Chicago
 
At the turn of the century,  when the great waves of
 
immigration brought thousands of Poles to the Chicago
 
area,  Poland did not exist as a nation.
 Poland had been
 
partitioned in 1795 among Russia,  Prussia and Austria,
 
and ethnic Poles referred to themselves as  "Russian
 
Poles,
 or  "Austrian Poles. w
 Language and the Roman
 
Catholic religion,  not nationality,  marked the Polish
 
people.
 
So in the United States,  early Polish immigrants
 
defined themselves by language,  ethnicity,  regional origin
 
and religion.
 They were mostly peasants with little formal
 
education,  who came for economic reasons,  working hard so
 
that their children might struggle up the ladder of success
 
in America.
 Education was an important rung on that
 
ladder,  and education for many of these children began in
 
Roman Catholic parochial schools.
 
Polish immigrants sought to establish Catholic
 
parishes that were Polish in character.
 They built many
 
churches and established schools with them.
 In the
 
parish schools most of the students came from Polish-
speaking homes and the teaching nuns also spoke Polish.
 
Each school was free to determine its own use of the
 
Polish language,  and schools seem to have varied widely;
 
depending on the school or even the individual teacher,
 
students might study only religious subjects or most of
 
/
 
the curriculum in Polish.
 Thus the  "Polish"  nature of
 
instruction in these parish schools seems to have arisen
 
from the fact that teachers and students shared a common
 
language,  rather than from an explicit desire to impart
 
to students a mastery of the Polish language or a need to
 
instill articulated values related to the traditions of
 
Poland.
 
Instruction in the Polish language In parochial
 
schools began to decline in the 1930's,  although it
 
persisted for another twenty years.
 During the
 
Depression,  pressures from the Archdiocese  (historically
 
dominated by Irish and German clerics hostile to
 
parishes that clung to an ethnic interpretation of
 
Catholicism)  to rid the parishes of  "foreign"
 
associations,  and a general pressure on immigrants to
 
assimilate,  contributed to the decline.
 
(Note:
 on the struggle between ethnic religious orders and
 
the Archdiocese for control of ethnic parishes,  see
 
Kantovjcz,  "Polish Chicago:
 Survival Through Solidarity,
*  
in Ethnic Chicano.
 
Polish immigration to the United States was halted in
 
the 1920's by restrictive immigration laws.
 Thirty years
 
passed before another significant wave of immigration Occured.
 
Isolated from Poland,  the Polish community evolved distinctive
 
Polish American traditions.
 A unique  "Chicago Polish"  dialect
 
arose as American-born children learned to speak the Polish
 
language based on the various regional dialects spoken by
 
their parents and teachers.
 Immigrants arriving after World
 
/
 
5
.
 
War II were surprised to find many archaic words and
 
grammatical constructions preserved in the speech of the
 
established Polish American community.
 
After. World War IX,  thousands of new immigrants flooded
 
the country from the refugee camps of Europe.
 These new
 
arrivals were to have a profound impact on the nature of
 
Chicago Polonja.
 They came from a Poland briefly reunited
 
between the world wars,  and had been raised with a strong
 
sense of Polish national identity.
 Nov they were refugees who
 
could not return to Communist Poland.
 Their strong love
 
of country,  fueled by a sense of being disinherited,  gave rise
 
to a deep need to keep alive things Polish and to pass bn to
 
their children raised in the United States pride and knowledge
 
of what it means to be Polish.
 
History of Chicago's Polish Schools
 
Chicago' s Polish schools have their roots in the
 
upheavals of World War II.
 The founders of the Polish
 
Teachers Association  (PTAA)  and a great many of the
 
teachers and parents currently active in the Polish
 
schools were adults or young children in Poland during
 
World War II.
 After the war many Poles found themselves
 
in either Displaced Persons camps  (also known as DP,  or
 
refugee camps)  in Germany or in temporary camps in
 
England for those associated with the Polish army.
 
(Note:
 During the war,  the Polish government in Exile
 
established itself in England;  the Polish Army fought
 
alongside the British Army.
 When the war ended the
 
Polish Army demobilized in England.)
 
I
 
47
 
Personal relationships farmed in the camps were
 
often longlasting,  carrying over to the immigrants'  new
 
homes.
 Polish teachers who set up schools in the camps
 
later helped establish Polish Saturday schools in the
 
countries where they finally settled:
 the United States,
 
England and Canada.
 Polish teachers'  organizations farmed
 
in the camps were models for later groups.
 
Under the Displaced Persons Act,  thousands of Polish
 
refugees came to the United States in the late 1940's and
 
1950's.
 Existing Polish American institutions met many
 
needs of the new arrivals,  but the parochial schools,
 
where the heritage of Poland's turn-of-the-century rural
 
traditions predominated,  could not.
 For Poles educated
 
in a united Poland between the two world wars,  knowledge
 
of the contemporary,  standard Polish language was an
 
important attribute of being Polish.
 They wanted thei
.
 
children to speak the language well and learn Polish
 
history and national traditions in a more structured way
 
than the home could provide.
 The parochial schools could
 
not teach modern Polish nor instill the contemporary
 
sense of Polish national identity.
 
So while many new immigrants sent their children to
 
parochial schools for their regular education,  they also
 
began to create special Polish schools.  In the 1950's,  as
 
Polish cultural education in parochial schools declined,
 
the Polish Saturday schools emerged.
 
Two Saturday schools were established in the early
 
1950's:
 General Kazimierz Pulaski Polish School and
 
Tadeusz Ko8cju
ko Polish School.
 Both are still in
 
operation,  offering a program of Polish education through
 
the high -school level.
 The schools met in the Polish
 
Triangle,  where Ashland,  Division and Milwaukee Avenues
 
come together on the near northwest side of Chicago,
 
until the early 1970's.
 They served thousands of
 
students;  Pulaski,  for example,  had 1
, 000 students in
 
1970.
 
This area was an important Polish neighborhood for
 
many years,  boasting numerous Polish parishes within
 
walking distance for any local resident.
 The building of
 
the John F.  Kennedy Expressway in the 1950's,  however,
 
changed the character of the neighborhood fundame n ta ll y .
r
 
Chicago Polonia fought bitterly and successfully to save
 
two magnificent Polish churches,  but Polish residents
 
slowly began to move out as lower-income housing was
 
built.
 The neighborhood is now primarily Hispanic,
 
although some Polish churches,  organizations and
 
businesses remain.
 New immigrants from Poland do settle
 
in the neighborhood,  but even they have found a more
 
comfortable niche further northwest along Milwaukee
 
Avenue.
 
As families moved out of the old neighborhood,  it
 
became increasingly difficult for students to attend
 
Saturday school there.
 Some families had reservations
 
about safety in the area.
 Enrollment soon dropped.
 
But many Polish families settled near each other in
 
new communities,  mostly in the far northwest Chicago
 
ighborhooda and in the northwest and western suburbs.
 
When they could no longer attend the old schools,  they
 
established new ones.
 Nine new schools were opened
 
I
 
during the 1970'a,  and two since 1980.
 These joined
 
earlier outlying schools established in Hammond,  Indiana
 
(just across the Indiana-Illinois state line from
 
Chicago)  and in Cicero,  Illinois,  a suburb just vest of
 
Chicago.
 Most of these schools offer only eight grades.
 
The older schools continued to operate,  but they
 
too moved to new locations,  following the resettlement of
 
Polish families farther northwest within the city of
 
Chicago.
 Pulaski and Kosciuszko Schools are among the
 
four schools that offer twelve grades,  and students come
 
from surrounding suburbs to continue Polish high school.
 
Polish education remains in demand.
 In 1980,
 
Polish Saturday schools enrolled around 2, 000 students.
 
By 1981-82,  enrollment had increased to 3, 000.
 The
 
steady growth of newer,  smaller schools may have
 
contributed to the increase.
 Increased immigration of
 
young parents from Poland may account for some new
 
students.
 This period,  too,  saw the election of a Polish
 
Pope and the struggle of the Solidarity Union in Poland.
 
The international honor and support awarded to these
 
representatives of Polish culture,  PTAA administrators
 
reported,  has been reflected in more positive attitudes
 
toward Polish Americans,  and may have influenced the
 
marked growth in Polish school enrollment.
 
The fact that all Polish schools are named for famous
 
Poles underscores the independent,  national orientation of
 
the schools.
 The two earliest schools were named for the
 
first well-known Polish Americans -- Revolutionary War
 
generals Kazimierz Pulaski and Tadeusz Kosciuszko.
 Other
 
schools are named after popular figures from World War II,
 
such as St.
 f
laksymjljan Kolbe and General Wiadjalaw
 
Anders.
 Copernicus, Paderewaki,  Sienkjewjcz and Chopin
 
schools are named for famous scientists and artists,  while
 
Maria Konapnlcka School commemorates a much-loved pc t.
 
The names of the St.  f
laksymjljan Kolbe and Pope John Paul
 
II schools  (there are several named after the Pope)
 
definitely have Polish rather than religious significance;
 
there are no schools named for other saints or popes.
 
Case Study:
 General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
General Casimir Pulaski Polish School offers
 
classes from first grade through high school.
 It is one
 
of four Polish high schools fed by the more numerous
 
Polish grammar schools in the Chicago area.
 In Polish,  its
 
name is Polska skola im.  Gen.  K.  Pulaskieqo  
Pulaski School's rapid growth during the 1950's
 
attests to the strength of the need it met.
 From its
 
beginnings with 200 students in 1954 it grew to 850 in
 
1961,  when high school, classes formed.
 In 1970,  1
, 000
 
students attended.
 As families left the Polish Triangle,
 
many Pulaski students went to the newly-formed,  smaller
 
schools in other neighborhoods and suburbs.
 In  1981-82,
 
350 students were enrolled in the school's twelve grades.
 
From the early 1950's until 1978,  Pulaski School met
 
in various locations in the Polish Triangle.
 The move in
 
1978 to the parish school facilities of St.  Wenceslaus
 
Roman Catholic Church,  3415 North LawndaJ.e Street,  took the
 
school further northwest within the city of Chicago.
 The
 
new neighborhood,  close to the  "new Polish Triangle,
 a
 
thriving community of nevly-arrived immigrants,  had many
 
1"
 
I
 
Polish families.
 Although St.  Wenceslaus W S S  founded by
 
Bohemian immigrants,  the current priest and many
 
parishioners are Polish.
 Ten per cent of Pulaski School's
 
students also attend the St.  Wenceslaus parochial school.
 
St.  Wenceslaus occupies an entire city block in a
 
quiet,  well-kept residential neighborhood of two- and
 
three-flat apartment buildings.
 The large,  substantial
 
brick buildings surrounded by plenty of space for playing
 
fields for the parish school's students.
 
Each Saturday at 8:30,  the parish school  aga in
 
bustles with activity,  as parents gather in the school's
 
basement hail before their children run off to Pulaski
 
School's morning sessions.
 Some wait here for their
 
children to finish,  parking infants in baby seats on the
 
tables while they conduct school business,  visit or read
 
the paper.
 Coffee and homemade pastries such as paczki--
a kind of Jelly doughnut--are available.
 
Ten classes are in session in the morning and ten in
 
the afternoon.
 The larger grades,  first through eighth,
 
meet in two sections--morning or afternoon.
 The high
 
school classes have fewer students,  so two classes meet in
 
the morning and the other two in the afternoon.
 Students
 
who participate in the arts classes,  which include singing,
 
poetry recitation,  and dancing,  either stay late or come
 
earlier than their class sessions.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
The primary goal of the school is to teach the Polish
 
language.
 To this end,  all, grades stress language skills
 
/

and all classes are conducted entirely in Polish.
 In first
 
through third grade,  reading and writing are the main
 
subjects.
 (As in Poland,  children are never taught to
 
print;  they immediately learn s c ri pt'.
 Some Polish history
 
and traditions are introduced,  primarily through legends
 
and stories taught to the class.
 The intermediate grades
 
continue Polish-language skills and literature and begin
 
Polish history and geography.
 The high school grades
 
emphasize the study
, of Polish literature and history.
 
Most of Pulaski's students come from homes where at least
 
one parent speaks Polish and the language is part of  the home
 
environment.
 Although all students come to Pulaski speaking
 
some Polish,  command of the language varies greatly.
 Everyone
 
acknowledges that the students are all most comfortable
 
speaking English.
 The first-grade teacher,  f
irs.  Helena
 
Sx-ouiek,  felt that she essentially presents Polish as a second
 
language.
 If students persist with Polish studies,  however,
 
and graduate from Polish high school,  they can speak and read
 
Polish fluently,  and write well.
 The high school classes
 
cover high-school level material in Polish.
 The school is
 
particularly proud of its high-school level graduates.
 
"Only the dedicated and motivated students really survive
 
and go through high school,  says Helena Ziolkovaka,  PTAA
 
President,  of the Polish high school graduates.
 "But once they
 
finish you really can converse with them fluently... they have
 
good knowledge of literature,  and write a goad paper.
 
The arts classes are called  "extra-curricular
 
activities,
*  because they are considered to be outside
 
the main curriculum of academic subjects.
 But the school
 
acknowledges their importance as enjoyable activities
 
I
 
that attract students and help keep them involved in the
 
school.
 
Students
 
Polish school parents and teachers recognize that
 
attracting and keeping students involved is vital to the
 
success of the schools.
 Activities such as extramural
 
school sports and other leisure time pursuits are
 
powerful competition to another day in school  and extra
 
homework.
 
Students at Pulaski seemed to agree on why they
 
attend,  at least initially:
 "My parents made me.
 
Those who stick with it either  "just get used to it"  and
 
quit fighting the inevitable,  or really get interested.
 
The parents'  motivation is often the deciding factor.
 
Older students raised two main reasons for keeping
 
on with their studies.
 One group wanted to learn the
 
Polish language to enhance their success in college or in
 
a career.
 But many students had visited their relatives
 
in Poland,  and these cited the usefulness and
 
satisfaction of being able to speak Polish with their
 
family and get around in another country.
 As Patricia
 
Witkowski described her trip to Poland at age 13,
 
"Suddenly it wasn't just all this Polish stuff--it was
 
real people and real places.
"  
Polish school is a challenging experience,  especially
 
in high school,  when the material catches up with the
 
actual age group and students use high-school  level texts
 
from Poland.
 But those who complete Polish high school,
 
'3
 
often in tandem with demanding college preparatory
 
classwork,  find the satisfaction great enough for
 
considerable sacrifice.
 Some,  in order to graduate with
 
their class,  finish two years of Polish high school in
 
one.
 And at the Pulaski High School graduation banquet,  a
 
young woman who commuted sixty miles each week from a
 
distant suburb received a special award for perfect
 
attendance.
 
Parents
 
Parents are the core of the Polish schools.
 Their
 
motivation for their children to attend Polish school is
 
the prime reason that most students begin and stay with
 
it.  Sometimes it becomes a battle;  the family member with
 
the most determination wins.
 But as older students
 
continue their Polish studies,  parents support them
 
through the increasing difficulties of scheduling and
 
commuting to activities and meeting increasing academic
 
demands.
 
Post-war immigrant parents wanted their Polish-
speaking children to become literate in Polish and to
 
know Polish history and culture.
 They felt that
 
establishing a formal educational environment would be
 
better than trying to teach such subjects at home.
 The
 
relative importance of these factors varies,  of course,
 
from family to family,  as does the commitment to speaking
 
Polish at home and to helping children with Polish-school
 
homework.
 
The high priority that Polish school families set on
 
education is reflected in their desire to send their
 
1
+
 
children to college.
 Clippings in the Pulaski Scho o l
 
scrapbook attest to Its pride in the higher-education
 
achievements Of its students.
 
Parents at Pulaski School pa y a modest tuition fee of
 
$75 per year,  $85 for two children from the same family,
 
Or $90 for three.
 They also support the 
 
sc hoo l b y
 
volunteering services for administration and fund-raisi ng ,
 
and attending special programs a t Christmas and Easter.
 
Perhaps even more important,  parents also sacrifice
 
considerable time and effort,  giving up their 
 
on l y
 
day for shopping and errands.
 Saying,  "MY Saturday is
 
shot anyway, "  they may arrange other classes for their
 
children such as music lessons or Polish Scouting meetings
 
for Saturday as well.
 Saturday is dedicated to the family.
 
Teachers
 
Teachers at Pulaski School range from young,  recent
 
Immigrants to Mrs.  Zurczak,  who celebrated her fiftieth
 
year in teaching in 1982.
 Only the first grade teacher,
 
Mrs.  Helena Sromek,  holds both Polish and American
 
teaching credentials.
 One o f the high school teachers,
 
Dr.  Janina Kras,  holds a 
 
Ph .D.  from Jagellonian
 
University In Krakow,  Poland's oldest and most -respected
 
ins ti t u tion
 
Because Polish language skills are the heart of
 
Pulaski's m1selon,  the school seeks teachers who have
 
Ir e c e n t l y  c o m e  f rom Pol and
TT
i

language.
 The school is aware thata r
ls
a,nguages change,  and
 
even teachers educated in Poland,  after they have been in
 
the United States ten or fifteen 
 
!
 
with the most current developments.
 These new teachers,
 
like their colleagues,  have teaching certification from
 
Poland.
 The school prefers teachers with certification
 
for elementary grades who specialLze in language arts,  and
 
hold a degree in Polish language.
 But when these
 
specialties are not available,  a good teacher with a
 
degree in another field may find a place as well.
 
Discipline in the classroom is an important theme
 
stressed by parents,  teachers and school officials.
 In
 
Polish and other European educational systems,  a certain
 
distance between teacher and students is traditionally part
 
of the way students express respect for the teacher.
 Some
 
Polish parents perceive the American classroom style as
 
"lax" and believe children do not learn as well n the
 
public schools because of this teaching style.
 Better
 
discipline is cited as a reason for enrolling children in
 
parochial rather than public schools.
 Thus continuing the
 
European tradition of classroom discipline is one of the
 
goals of Pulaski School..
 Classes are quiet and students
 
stand by their desks to respond.
 Teachers remain
 
affectionate toward the youngest students,  however,  and
 
cordial with older pupils.
 
School Administration
 
Like each school in the network,  Pulaski School
 
maintains its own independent school administration.
 A
 
Parent-Teacher Association elects the school board,  which
 
negotiates for space,  sets teacher salaries and pays the
 
bills.
 
Tuition covers the majority of the school, budget,
 
I
 
' (
'p
 
around $14, 000 a year.
 Remaining funds come from
 
contributions by Polish organizations  (channeled through
 
the Polish Teachers Association)  and fund-raising efforts
 
by parents.
 Parents'  cont ributions--service on the school
 
board,  sewing costumes for school presentations,
 
organizing and baking for the yearly fund-raiser--are
 
essential  to keeping the school running.
 School
 
administrators stress the difficulties of raising even
 
relatively modest amounts of money and the personal
 
sacrifices of all
. involved.
 
The Polish American community has several  large
 
fraternal organizations which help to support various
 
community cultural efforts.
 Some Polish schools have
 
chosen to affiliate with these organizations,  such as the
 
Polish National Alliance or the Polish Roman Catholic
 
Union,  which then contribute to the school's maintenance.
 
Other schools feel that the resulting financial support
 
also means sharing giving up some decision-making powers
 
to the larger organizations.
 Pulaski School has chosen
 
to remain independent,  maintaining full control over
 
school affairs as well as full financial responsibility.
 
The Polish  Teachers Association in America,  Inc.
 
the Network of Polish Schools
 
The Polish Teachers Association in America,  Inc.
 
. ses the shared concerns of the Polish schools in the
 
Chicago area' s fifteen-school network.
 One of the most
 
pressing issues is the unique curriculum needs of ethnic
 
schools.
 Language and other texts developed for use in
 
'
-
7
 
the home country do not relate to the experience of
 
children growing up in the United States,  while books
 
developed for students with no knowledge of a language are
 
inappropriate for children who speak the language at home.
 
Therefore,  ethnic schools are forced to adapt books which
 
are not suited to their needs or to write new ones.
 
For many years individual teachers in the Polish
 
Saturday Schools had to resolve the problem of teaching
 
materials on their own.
 Some were remarkably successful.
 
A seventeen-year veteran teacher at Pulaski High School,
 
Mrs.  Maria Neumann,  proudly opened a closet door to reveal
 
five floor-to-ceiling bookcases holding an extensive
 
library of Polish literature and reference books that she
 
has accumulated for her students.
 In another classroom,
 
hand-drawn,  wall-size maps of Poland illustrated historical
 
changes in territory.
 
To address the need for textbooks and teaching
 
materials,  in the mid-1960'2 the PTAA began to develop
 
their own.
 Their first project was Polska Howa (The
 
Polish Lanquaqe), an introduction to the Polish language
 
for older children and adults.
 Nov in its eighth edition,
 
Polska N wa is used not only in Polish Saturday schools in
 
the United States,  Canada,  England and Australia,  but in
 
college and high school Polish language classes.
 
Later projects focused on developing readers in
 
literature and history for elementary and junior high
 
school grades,  since high school classes can often use high
 
school literature texts from Poland.
 History texts,
 
however,  are a very sensitive subject,  since texts from
 
Poland written since the Communist takeover are
 
jg
 
Considered unacceptable.
 With this in mind,  the PTAA
 
developed a four-volume History of Poland. 
Texts are
 
also exchanged with Polish schools in England and Canada
 
where similar curriculum-development efforts have taken
 
place.
 
Like so many other activities in the Polish schools,
 
creating the textbooks is a labor of love.
 Professional
 
educators from the organization volunteer their time for
 
extensive commitments,  since writing a text can take
 
several years.
 
In the 1970's,  as the Polish school network expanded
 
rapidly,  the PTAA began work on a standardized curriculum
 
to aid teachers and allow students to move more easily
 
between schools.
 The PTAA established guidelines for the
 
types of classes to be offered:  kindergarten,  eight years
 
of elementary school and four years of high school for
 
Polish-speaking children;  introductory classes for
 
children who do not speak Polish;  and a singing,  music,
 
dance and theater program.
 Detailed curriculum guidelines
 
for each year are being developed.
 
The PTAA offers a variety of support services to its
 
member schools.
 It sponsors activities that promote
 
Polish-language teaching,  notably popular essay and
 
poetry recitation contests.
 In 1982,  a poetry recitation
 
contest attracted enthusiastic participation from 800
 
students from Polish Saturday schools,  public and private
 
high school Polish classes,  and area colleges.
 The
 
organization maintains a small lending library of
 
teaching aids,  including pictures,  slide-tape programs
 
and equipment.
 
1
'?
 
Polish community organizations often work together,
 
and the PTAA supports the activities of many other Chicago-
area Polish Institutions.
 One concrete manifestation of
 
community solidarity is the Polish Constitution Day Parade
 
in May.
 Among the floats decked out in Poland's colors--
white and red--march students bearing the Polish language
 
school standards.  From each flag the school' s namesake--
Pulaski,  Chopin,  Paderewskj--watches over its charges.
 
The Polish Teachers Association in America was
 
originally organized as a professional organization for
 
all teachers of Polish descent,  even those not teaching
 
in Polish schools.
 This continues to be an important
 
function.
 The organization sponsors teacher in-service
 
seminars,  and has co-sponsored courses with the Chicago
 
Board of Education to help new arrivals qualify for
 
American teaching credentials.
 
The PTAA also serves as an accrediting body for
 
teachers who apply to work in the Polish schools.
 The
 
group is very concerned about upholding standards.
 It
 
first verifies the applicants'  Polish credentials,  then
 
places their names on a waiting list.
 In spite of low
 
pay and inconvenient hours,  there is usually a waiting
 
list for positions in the Polish schools.
 In Poland,
 
teaching is a highly respected if poorly paid profession.
 
Many teachers newly-arrived in Chicago are unable to learn
 
English well enough to recertify to teach in American
 
schools.
 Being unable to work in an often-beloved
 
profession is a blow to their self-esteem,  ao immigrant
 
teachers seek out the Polish schools.
 
Pulaski' s principal,  Mr.  Jozef Zurczak,  understood
 
I
 
the feeling completely:
 "They say that they only feel
 
like people on Saturdays.
.
.
.  They m i s s  their profession,
 
they miss working with children. "
 Others feel very
 
strongly that they should not waste specialized training
 
and talents:
 "I can't ask an engineer or a mechanic to do
 
it, "  says Helena Ziolkowska.
 "I' m the one with the
 
training and it is my responsibility to use it. "
 Some
 
younger women at home with small children,  often Polish
 
school graduates,  find Saturday school a convenient way to
 
keep up with previous involvements.
 
Personal motivation must be high to keep teachers in
 
the schools.
 Salaries often have not covered much more
 
st of gas and childcare.
 One teacher noted
 
the 1960' s she worked for $6 a day and paid
 
er babysitter $10.
 Salaries now range from $6 to $10
 
per  hour .
 
Ninety per cent of the teachers in the Polish
 
Saturday schools were born and educated in Poland.
 They
 
range in age from 25 to 70.
 The newly-arrived help to
 
keep contemporary Polish language in the schools,  while
 
bilingual teachers raised in the United States teach the
 
classes for children from English-speaking homes.
 
The Polish Teachers Association provides a
 
constellation of services that supports the educators
 
and schools of the Polish schools network.  PTAA
 
efforts in all areas--textbook development,  curriculum
 
standardization,  and teacher accreditation and
 
development--reflect their high standards as profeasionals
 
and their determination to provide an educational
 
experience through which students really master the
 
I
 
language.
 
The Future of the Polish Saturday Schools
 
The Polish schools serve primarily their own ethnic
 
community.
 In the 198ø' ,  however,  one of their major
 
concerns is their relationship with the larger society.
 
The schools would  like to be recognized by the Illinois
 
State Board of Education so that their students would
 
receive credit for their achievements in a second language.
 
State recognition would be a great help to Polish and other
 
ethnic schools in attracting and keeping students.
 
Polish and other ethnic schools realize that they are
 
helping to supply a resource -- bilingual people--that is
 
much in demand by government and business.
 These schools
 
help to fijl the gap left by declining foreign-language
 
education in American schools.
 Ethnic school officials,
 
teachers and parents are frustrated that recognition of
 
their efforts is coming so slowly.
 Several proposals to
 
the State Board of Education over the past ten years have
 
been rejected.
 Yet,  the fact that the issue arises at al
 
is an indication of ethnic communities'  increasing
 
willingness to make a public case for recognition of their
 
contributions to the larger American society.
 
Will the Polish Saturday schools continue to serve
 
the needs of Polonia?
 As the generation that founded the
 
Polish Saturday schools graduates their youngest children
 
from high school in the early 1980's,  the future is
 
uncertain.
 Third- and fourth -generation Polish American
 
families have not strongly supported the Saturday schools
 
in the past.
 And although there are significant numbers of
 
more recent  immigrants from Poland,  post-var immigrants
 
perceive the attitudes of these recent arrivals toward
 
Pol
h  education to be different from their own.
 As past
 
/
 or
n  .
.
i L p e
 
the early  '40s and  '50s were survivors of World
 
War II,  and they were very patriotic.
 And to them
 
survival meant to be Polish and to keep the Polish
 
language and faith and traditions.
.
.
.  If these people
 
were able to transfer their motivations and feelings
 
to the next generation,  then these children have
 
children now and they send them to Polish schools.
 
But not all of them succeeded.
 Some of the children
 
went to Polish schools because they had to,  and
 
once they got married,  sometimes to people of
 
different nationality,  they didn't pay that much
 
attention....
 
But people who come from Poland right now are of
 
different stock.... Many of them don't feel that they
 
should keep up the Polish tradition.
 Not everybody,
 
but quite a big percentage,  assimilates very
 
quickly.
 They don't talk Polish at home..
.
.  it's
 
very sad.... I don't feel sorry for them,  I feel
 
sorry for their children,  because they end up not
 
knowing anything about themselves.
 
I have a duty to give what  I received to the next
 
Z3
 
2
 
generation.
 Language,  culture,  history,  tradition,
 
national pride enrich your life.
 But more than that,
 
if you know who you are and where you come from,  you
 
know what you're worth.
" 
Conclusions
 
Perhaps the most important contribution of the Polish
 
schools is that they help young people develop a positive
 
sense of self-identity that includes being Polish
 
American.
 Being ethnic in the United States is a
 
pervasive part of American society,  one that does not
 
disappear readily even over several generations.
 As this
 
fact becomes more widely acknowledged,  we need to seek
 
ways to help people accept and use their ethnic identity
 
positively.
 Polish and other ethnic schools provide a
 
useful skill--knowledge of a second language--which can
 
in itself be a source of pride and achievement.
 But we
 
are also struggling with the problem of having thousands
 
of Americans go through life coping with profound
 
ambivalence and self-doubt because they have been told
 
that  "being ethnic" is not a positive part of  "being
 
American.
"  
Ethnic schools strengthen the fabric of
 
American life as they help young people to accept,
 
validate,  and integrate their varying heritages into
 
their concepts of being American.

POLISH SATURDAY SCHOOLS
 CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
 
Margy McClain
 
Patricia
 ir ows i grew up in South Chicago, a neign'oorhood on
 
Chicago's far southeast side. From the t
ime she was three, Patricia made
 
a fifty-mile round trip each week to a neighborhood then known a
s the
 
"Polish Triangle," just northeast of downtown Chicago,  to attend Polish
 
Saturday school.
 
Growing up in the 1
960s, Patricia  spoke Polisd at home and wore
 
pigtails "when it wasn't '
in'  to be ethnic." She also attended parochi
 
schools in predominantly Polish parishes, but there the Polish langua
 
was not encouraged.  The teachers were Felician sisters, a Polish ord€
 
They t
aught in English and scolded in Polish.
 
Faced with Polish jokes and other images which stressed the negative
 
stereotype of the "dumb Polak,"  Patricia easily felt defensive about
 
being Polish. So going to Polish Saturday school was worth the
 
aggravation of another day of school. Polish school counteracted the
 
negative stereotypes encountered elsewhere and provided "a sense of
 
history, culture, ethnic identity .  .  .  [and the  feeling that] hey, I
 
belong to a group of people and they are important." That feeling gave
 
Patricia the confidence to deal with the problem of "being different"
 
that seemed to bother friends who had not been given a strong sense of
 
Polish identity.
 
Patricia has been active through the years in various Polish
 
organizations, serving at times as Polish-language secretary. She values
 
her fluency in the Polish language, achieved through twelve years of
 
PolLsh Saturday school study and
 
raised in the United States. But
 
Polish Saturday school nourished
 
Polish-American.
 
a noteworthy accomplishment for someone
 
more than anything else, she says,
 
her sense of self-worth as a

Witold Pawlikowski was just a small boy in 1
939 when the Soviet
 
Union invaded Poland and occupied his hometown. His father disappeared
 
without a trace, and the rest of the family was deported to Siberia.
 
After great hardships, the Pawlikowskis and other Polish military
 
families were sent to Iran. After World War II they eventually made their
 
way to England, where the Polish government in exile had spent the war,
 
and then to the United States. Witold served in the United States Army,
 
then settled in Chicago in 1
957 and completed his engineering education.
 
Because of his childhood experiences of uprooting and loss, Mr.
 
Pawlikowski felt strongly that his daughter Beata should have a good
 
education —"the one thing that can't be taken away from you" —and that
 
she should know her Polish heritage of language, history, and traditions.
 
He wanted her to speak the language at home and to know Polish grammar
 
and read Polish literature. He and his wife Yolantha, the daughter of two
 
teachers who take an active part in Chicago's Polish Saturday schools,
 
cajoled and supported their daughter through twelve years of Polish
 
school. Like Patricia Witkowski, Beata Pawlikowski is a graduate of the
 
General Casimir Pulaski Polish High School.
 
The Witkowski and Pawlikowski families are members of Chicago's
 
strong Polish-American community or "Polonia," as Polish communities
 
outside Poland term themselves. They and many like them in Chicago's
 
diverse ethnic groups passionately desire to pass on to their children
 
the traditions, values, and symbols of their ethnic identity which have
 
shaped their own lives.
 
Chicago ethnic communities educate their children as ethnic
 
Americans in many ways, from family training to church activities, lodge
 
events, and formal ethnic schooling. At least twenty of Chicago's
 
eighty-plus ethnic groups, and perhaps many more, support ethnic heritage
 
schools. Chicago Polonia, one of the largest ethnic communities in the
 
area, claims over 700,000 people of Polish descent living in the Chicago
 
area. In 1
982 the Polish community in Chicago supported a network of
 
fifteen Polish Saturday schools.
 
An umbrella organization of professional Polish educators, t
he
 
Polish Teachers Association in America, Inc., coordinates the Saturday
 
school network. The schools are generally referred to as Polish language
 
schools or Polish Saturday schools, (or, more informally, simply as
 
Polish school). They meet on Saturdays and offer instruction in Polish
 
language and history for students from kindergarten through high school.
 
Polish high school graduates speak Polish fluently and have a command of
 
the written language, literary traditions, and Polish history. Through
 
the schools students also gain a sense of confidence and pride in being
 
Polish-American. Maintaining the schools is a community effort
 
accomplished with relatively little money and a great deal of energy.
 
Over and over again, teachers and parents testified that these efforts on
 
behalf of the schools are labors of love and extremely important t
o them.
 
Early Polish Education in Chicago
 
"
I 
At the turn of the 1
9th century, when the great waves of
 
immigration brought thousands of Poles to the Chicago area, Poland did
 
not exist as a nation. Poland had been partitioned in 1
795 among Russia,
 
Prussia, and Austria, and ethnic Poles referred to themselves a
s "Russian
 
Poles," or "Austrian Poles." Language and the Roman Catholic r
eligion,
 
X
V
, 
rather than nationality, marked the Polish people
 
a
 
fueled by a sense of being disinherited, gave r
ise to a deep need to keep
 
alive things Polish and to pass on to their children raised in the United
 
States a pride and knowledge of what it means to be Polish.
 
History of Chicago's Polish Schools
 
Chicago's Polish schools have their roots in the upheavals of World
 
War II. The founders of the Polish Teachers Association in America, Inc.
 
(PTAA) and a great many of the teachers and parents currently active in
 
the Polish schools were adults or young children in Poland during World
 
War II. After the war many Poles found themselves in either Displaced
 
Persons camps (also known as DP or refugee camps) in Germany or in
 
temporary camps in England for those associated with the Polish Army. I
 
Personal relationships formed in the camps were often longlasting,
 
carrying over to the immigrants' new homes. Polish teachers who set up
 
schools in the camps later helped establish Polish Saturday schools in
 
the countries where they finally settled: the United States, England, and
 
Canada. Polish teachers' organizations formed in the camps were models
 
for later groups.
 
Thousands of Polish refugees came to the United States in the late
 
1940s and 1950s under the Displaced Persons Act. Existing Polish-American
 
institutions met many needs of the new arrivals, but the parochial
 
schools, where the heritage of Poland's turn-of--the-century rural
 
traditions predominated, could not. For Poles educated in a united Poland
 
between the two world wars, knowledge of the contemporary, standard
 
Polish language was an important attribute of being Polish. They wanted
 
their children to speak the language well and learn Polish history and
 
national traditions in a more structured way than the home could provide.
 
The parochial schools could not teach modern Polish nor instill a
 
contemporary sense of Polish national identity.
 
'During World War II the Polish government in exile established itself in
 
England. The Polish Army fought alongside the British Army and, when the
 
war ended, the Polish Army demobilized in England.
 
6
 
So, while many new immigrants sent their children to parochial
 
schools for their regular education, they also began to create special
 
Polish schools. In the 1950s, as Polish cultural education in parochial
 
schools declined,  the Polish Saturday schools emerged.
 
vi 
Chicago's Polish community e
stablished two Saturday schools in the
 
early 1
950s: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School and Tadeusz Kosciuszko
 
Polish School. Both are still in operation, offering a program of Polish
 
education through high school. The schools were located in the Polish
 
Triangle--where Ashland, Division, and Milwaukee Avenues come together on
 
the near northwest side of Chicago —until the early 1970s. They served
 
thousands of students. For example, Pulaski had 1
,000 students in 1
970.
 
The Polish Triangle was an important Polish neighborhood for many
 
years, boasting numerous Polish parishes. The building of the John F
.
 
Kennedy Expressway in the 1950s, however, changed the character
 
neighborhood fundamentally. Chicago Polonia fought bitterly an
 
successfully to save two magnificent Polish churches, but Poli;,
 
residents slowly began to move out as lower-income housing was bul-IC.  iae
 
neighborhood is now primarily Hispanic, although some Polish churches,
 
organizations, and businesses remain. New immigrants from Poland settle
 
in the neighborhood, but even they have found a more comfortable area
 
further northwest along Milwaukee Avenue.
 
As families moved out of the old neighborhood it became increasingly
 
difficult for students to attend Saturday school there. Some families
 
felt unsafe.  School enrollment soon dropped.
 
Many Polish families who left the inner c
ity settled near each other
 
in new communities mostly in far northwest Chicago neighborhoods and in
 
the northwest and western suburbs. When they could no longer attend the
 
old schools, they established new ones. Nine new schools opened during
 
the 1
970s and two have opened since 1
980. They joined earlier outlying
 
schools established in Hammond, Indiana (
just across the Indiana-Illinois
 
state line from Chicago) and in Cicero, Illinois, a suburb just west of
 
Chicago. Most of the schools now offer only eight grades.
 
'

The older schools continued t
o operate, but they too moved t
o new
 
l
ocations, following t
he r
esettlement of Polish families farther
 
northwest within the c
ity of Chicago. Pulaski and Kos
"'ciuszko are among
 
t
he four schools in Chicago t
hat offer all twelve grades, s
o s
tudents
 
come from surrounding s
uburbs t
o continue Polish high school.
 
Polish education r
emains in demand. In 1
980 Polish Saturday schools
 
enrolled around 2
,000 students. By 1
981-1982 enrollment had increased to
 
3
,000. The steady growth of newer, smaller schools may have c
ontributed
 
t
o the increase. The continuing immigration of young parents from Poland
 
may also account for s
ome new s
tudents. In addition, the election o
f a
 
Polish pope and the s
truggle of the Solidarity Union in Poland has
 
encouraged more positive a
ttitudes t
oward Polish-Americans, and may have
 
influenced the marked growth in Polish school enrollment.
 
The fact that all Polish schools are named f
or famous Poles
 
underscores the independent, national orientation of the schools. The two
 
earliest schools were named for the first well-known
 
Polish-Americans —Revolutionary War generals Casimir Pulaski and
 
Tadeusz Kosciuszko. Other schools are named after popular figures from
 
World War 11, such a
s S
t. Maksymilian Kolbe and General WXadislaw Anders.
 
The names of some r
ecall famous scientists and artists, such
 
a
s Copernicus, Paderewski, Sienkiewicz, and Chopin, while Maria
 
Konopnicka School c
ommemorates a much-loved poet. The choice o
f the names
 
-St. Maksymilian Kolbe and Pope John Paul II (
there are several named
 
after the Pope) definitely have Polish rather than religious
 
significance; there are no schools named for other saints or popes.

Pulaski's rapid growth during the 1950s attests to the strength of
 
the need it met. Beginning with 200 students in 1954, it grew to 850 in
 
1
961, when high school classes formed. In 1970 1
,000 students attended.
 
As families left the Polish Triangle, many Pulaski students went to the
 
newly formed, smaller schools in other neighborhoods and suburbs. Some
 
350 students were enrolled in the school's twelve grades during the
 
1
981-1982 school year.
 
From the early 1
950s until 1
978, Pulaski school met in various
 
locations in the Polish Triangle. The move in 1
978 to the parish school
 
facilities of St. Wenceslaus Roman Catholic Church, 3415 North Lawndale
 
Street, took the school further northwest within the city of Chicago. The
 
new neighborhood, close to the "new Polish Triangle," a thriving
 
community of newly arrived immigrants, housed many Polish families.
 
Although Bohemian immigrants founded St. Wenceslaus, the current priest
 
and many parishioners are Polish. Ten percent of Pulaski's students also
 
attend the St. Wenceslaus parochial school. St. Wenceslaus occupies an
 
entire city block in a quiet, well-kept residential neighborhood of two-
and three-flat apartment buildings. Ample space for playing fields
 
surround the large, substantial brick buildings of the parish school.
 
Each Saturday at 8
:30 A.M. the parish school again bustles with
 
activity, as parents gather in the basement hail before their children
 
run off to Pulaski's morning sessions. Some wait there for their children
 
to finish, setting infants in baby seats on the while they conduct school
 
business, visit, or read the paper. Coffee and homemade pastries such as
 
paczki, a kind of jelly doughnut, are available.
 
Ten classes meet in the morning and ten in the afternoon. The larger
 
grades, first through eighth, have two sections; one section of grades
 
one through eight meets in the morning and the other in the afternoon.
 
The high school classes have fewer students, so two high school classes
 
meet in the morning and the other two in the afternoon. Students who
 
participate in the arts classes, which include singing, poetry
 
recitation,  and dancing, either stay later or come earlier.

Classes and Curriculum: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
The school's primary goal i
s t
o teach the Polish language. To this
 
end all grades stress l
anguage skills and all c
lasses speak exclusively
 
in Polish. Reading and writing are the main subjects in first through
 
third grades. The younger s
tudents l
earn some Polish history and
 
traditions, primarily through legends and stories. The intermediate
 
grades r
efine Polish language skills, c
ontinued l
iterature, and begin
 
Polish history and geography. The high school grades emphasize the study
 
o
f Polish literature and history.
 
Most of Pulaski's s
tudents c
ome from homes where a
t least one parent
 
speaks Polish and the language i
s part of the home environment. Although
 
all s
tudents come t
o Pulaski speaking some Polish, command o
f t
he
 
language varies greatly. Everyone acknowledges that the students are all
 
most c
omfortable speaking English. The first grade teacher, Mrs. Helena
 
Sroiuek, felt that she essentially teaches Polish a
s a second language. If
 
s
tudents persist with Polish studies and graduate from Polish high
 
school, they can speak and read Polish fluently, however. They write
 
well, t
oo. The high school classes c
over high school level material in
 
Polish. The school i
s particularly proud of its high school graduates.
 
I
 
"
Only the dedicated and motivated students really survive and go
 
through high school," says Helena Zio kowska, PTAA president. "
But once
 
they f
inish you really can converse with them fluently .
 .  .  t
hey have
 
good knowledge of literature and write a good paper."
 
The arts classes are called extracurricular activities, because
 
they are considered t
o be outside the main curriculum of academic
 
subjects. The school acknowledges their importance a
s enjoyable
 
activities that attract students and help keep them involved in the
 
school, however.

Students: General Casimir Pulaski High School
 
Polish school parents and teachers recognize that attracting and
 
keeping students involved is vital to the success of the schools.
 
Activities such as extramural school sports and other leisure t
ime
 
pursuits are powerful competition to another day in school and extra
 
homework.
 
Students at Pulaski seemed to agree about why they attend, at least
 
initially:  "My parents made me."  Those who stick with it either "
just
 
get used to it" and quit fighting the inevitable, or really get
 
interested.  The parents t motivation i
s often the deciding factor.
 
Older students raised two main reasons for keeping on with their
 
studies. One group wanted to learn the Polish language to enhance the
'i.
 
success in college or in a career. Other students had visited their
 
relatives in Poland, and cited the satisfaction of being able to speak
 
Polish with their family and get around in another country. As Patricia
 
Witkowski described her trip to Poland at age thirteen, "Suddenly it
 
wasn't just all this Polish stuff--it was real people and real places."
 
Polish school is a challenging experience, especially in high
 
school, when the curriculum matches the actual age of the students, who
 
use high school level texts from Poland. Those who complete Polish high
 
school, often fulfilling demanding college preparatory classwork at the
 
same time, find the satisfaction great enough for considerable sacrifice.
 
Some finish two years of Polish high school in one to graduate with their
 
class.
 
Parents: General Casimir Pulaski High School
 
Parents are the core of the Polish schools. Their motivation for
 
their children to attend Polish school is the prime reason that most
 
students begin classes and stay with them. Sometimes it becomes a battle,
 
and the family member with the most determination wins. As older students
 
1
1
 
c
ontinue their Polish s
tudies, parents support t
hem through t
he
 
increasing difficulties o
f scheduling, commuting, and meeting increasing
 
academic demands.
 
Post-war immigrant parents wanted their Polish s
peaking c
hildren to
 
become l
iterate in Polish and t
o know Polish history and culture. They
 
felt that e
stablishing a formal educational environment would be better
 
than t
rying to teach such subjects a
t home. The relative importance of
 
these factors varies, o
f c
ourse,  'from family to family, a
s d
oes the
 
commitment to speaking Polish a
t home and t
o helping children with
 
Polish homework.
 
The high priority that Polish school families set on education i
s
 
reflected in their desire to send their children t
o college. Clippings in
 
the Pulaski school scrapbook attest t
o i
ts pride in the higher e
ducation
 
achievements of its students.
 
Parents at Pulaski school pay a modest tuition fee of $
70 for one
 
child per year, $85 for two children from the same family, or $90 for
 
three. They also support the school by volunteering their s
ervices for
 
administration and fund-raising activities, and by attending s
pecial
 
programs a
t Christmas and Easter.
 
Perhaps even more important, parents also s
acrifice c
onsiderable
 
t
ime and effort, giving up their only day free for shopping and errands.
 
Saying, "My Saturday i
s shot anyway," they may arrange other c
lasses,
 
such a
s music lessons, for their children, or attend Polish scout
 
meetings a
s well. Saturday i
s a family day.
 
Teachers: General Casimir Pulaski High School
 
/
 Teachers at Pulaski school range from recent immigrants t
o
 
Mrs.  urczak, who c
elebrated her fiftieth year in teaching in 1
982. Only
 
the first grade teacher,  Mrs. Helena Sromek, has both Polish and
 
1
2
 
American teaching credentials. One of t
r
ie high school teachers,  Dr.
 
Janina Kras, holds a Ph.D. from Jagellonian University in Krakow,
 
Poland's oldest and most-respected institution of higher learning.
 
Because Polish language skills are the heart of Pulaski's mission,
 
the school seeks teachers who have recently come from Poland and know the
 
most up-to-date language. The school is aware that languages change, and
 
even t
eachers educated in Poland are out of touch with the most current
 
developments after they have been in the United States ten or fifteen
 
years. The new teachers, like their colleagues, have teaching
 
certification from Poland. The school prefers certified teachers who
 
specialized in language arts and have a degree in Polish language for
 
elementary grades. When teachers with a language specialty are not
 
available, a good teacher with a degree in another field may f
ind a place
 
in the school as well.
 
Classroom discipline is an important theme stressed by
 
parents, teachers, and school officials. In Polish and other European
 
educational systems, maintaining a certain distance between teacher and
 
students is traditionally part of the way students express respect for
 
the teacher. Some Polish parents perceive the American classroom s
tyle as
 
lax and believe children do not learn as well in the public schools
 
because of it. Better discipline is cited as a reason for enrolling
 
children in parochial rather than public schools. Continuing the
 
European tradition of classroom discipline is one of the goals of Pulaski
 
Bchool. Classes are quiet and students stand by their desks to respond.
 
Teachers remain affectionate toward the youngest students, however, and
 
cordial with older pupils.
 
School Administration: General Casimir Pulaski High School
 
Like each school in the network, Pulaski school maintains its own
 
independent school administration. A Parent-Teacher Association elects
 
the school board, which negotiates for space, sets teachers' salaries,
 
and pays the bills.
 
1
3
 
Tuition covers the majority of the school budget, around $
14,000 a
 
year. The remaining funds come from c
ontributions made by Polish
 
organizations (channeled through the Polish Teachers Association) and
 
fund-raising efforts by parents. Parents' c
ontributions —service on the
 
school board, sewing costumes for school presentations, organizing, and
 
baking f
or the yearly fund-raisers--are e
ssential. Administrators s
tress
 
the difficulties of raising even relatively modest amounts o
f money and
 
the personal sacrifices o
f a
ll involved.
 
The Polish-American community has several large fraternal
 
organizations which help to support various community cultural e
fforts.
 
Some Polish schools have chosen t
o affiliate with these organizations,
 
such a
s the Polish National Alliance or the Polish Roman Catholic Union,
 
which then contribute t
o the school's maintenance. Other schools feel
 
that t
he resulting f
inancial support also means giving up some
 
decision-making powers t
o the larger organizations. Pulaski school has
 
chosen t
o remain independent, maintaining full c
ontrol over school
 
affairs and assuming full financial responsibility.
 
Administration: The Polish Schools Network
 
PTAA addresses the shared concerns o
f the Polish schools in the
 
Chicago area's fifteen-school network. One of the most pressing i
ssues I
 
the unique curriculum needs of ethnic schools. Language and other texts
 
developed for use in the home country do not relate to the experience of
 
children growing up in the United States, while books developed for
 
s
tudents with no knowledge o
f the language are inappropriate for children
 
who speak the language a
t home. Ethnic schools are forced, therefore, to
 
adapt books which are not suited to their needs or t
o write new ones.
 
For many years individual teachers in the Polish Saturday schools
 
had t
o resolve the problem of teaching materials on their own. Some were
 
remarkably successful. Mrs. Maria Neumann, a seventeen-year veteran
 
t
eacher a
t Pulaski high school, proudly opened a c
loset door t
o r
eveal
 
1
4
 
five floor-to-ceiling bookcases holding an extensive library of Polish
 
literature and reference books that she has accumulated for her students.
 
In another classroom hand-drawn, wall-size maps of Poland illustrated
 
historical changes in the nation's territory.
 
The PTAA began to develop its own textbooks and teaching materials
 
in the mid-1960s. Its first project was Polska Mowa (The Polish,  
 
/'anguag ) r n introduction to the Polish language for older children and
 
adults. Now in its eighth edition, Polska Mowa is used not only in Polish
 
Saturday schools in the United States, Canada, England,  and Australia,
 
but in college and high school Polish language classes
.
 
Later projects focused on developing literature and history readers
 
for the elementary and junior high school grades, because high school
 
classes can often use high school literature texts from Poland. History
 
texts from Poland written since the Communist takeover are considered
 
unacceptable, however. The PTAA has developed, therefore, a four-volume
 
History of Poland. Texts are also exchanged with Polish schools in
 
England and Canada, where similar curriculum-development efforts have
 
taken place.
 
Like so many o
ther activities in the Polish schools, creati:
 
textbooks is a labor of love. Professional educators from the PT
 
volunteer their time. It is an  extensive commitment, since writing a
 
text can take several years.
 
In the 1
970s, as the Polish school network expanded rapidly, the
 
PTAA began work on a standardized curriculum to aid teachers and allow
 
students to move more easily between schools. The PTAA established
 
guidelines for the types of classes to be offered: kindergarten, eight
 
years of elementary school, and four years of high school for
 
Polish-speaking children; introductory classes for children who do not
 
speak Polish; and a singing, music, dance, and theater program. The
 
association is developing detailed curriculum guidelines for each year.
 
1

The PTAA offers a variety o
f support s
ervices t
o its member schools.
 
It sponsors activities, notably popular essay and poetry recitation
 
c
ontests, that promote Polish language teaching. A poetry recitation
 
contest in 1
982 attracted enthusiastic participation from 800 students
 
from Polish Saturday schools, public and private high school Polish
 
classes, and area colleges. The organization also maintains a small
 
lending l
ibrary of t
eaching a
ids, including pictures, slide-tape
 
programs, and equipment.
 
Polish community organizations o
ften work t
ogether, and t
he PTAA
 
supports the activities o
f many other Chicago-area Polish institutions.
 
One c
oncrete manifestation of c
ommunity solidarity i
s the Polish
 
Constitution Day parade in May. Among the floats decked out in Poland's
 
r
ed and white colors s
tudents march, bearing Polish language school
 
standards. From each flag the school's namesake —Pulaski, Chopin,
 
Paderewski--watches over i
ts charges.
 
The PTAA was originally organized a
s a professional organization for
 
all teachers of Polish descent, even those not teaching in Polish
 
schools. The organization sponsors t
eacher in-service seminars, and has
 
c
o-sponsored courses with the Chicago Board of Education to help new
 
arrivals qualify for American t
eaching credentials.
 
The PTAA also serves a
s en accrediting body for teachers who apply
 
t
o work in the Polish schools. The group i
s very c
oncerned about
 
upholding standards. I
t verifies the applicants' Polish credentials,
 
then places their names on a waiting l
ist. In spite of low pay and
 
inconvenient hours, there i
s usually a waiting list for positions in the
 
Polish schools. In Poland teaching i
s a highly respected, i
f poorly paid,
 
profession. Many teachers newly arrived in Chicago are unable t
o learn
 
English well enough t
o get r
ecertified to t
each in American schools.
 
Being unable to work in the profession they often love is a blow t
o their
 
self-esteem, so immigrant t
eachers s
eek out the Polish schools.
 
1
6
 
/
 
Pulaski's principal, Mr. Jozef Zurczak, understands their
 
motivations completely: "They say that they only feel like people on
 
Saturday's.  .
 .
 .  They miss their profession, they miss working with
 
children." Others feel very strongly that they should not waste
 
specialized training and talents: "1 can't ask an engineer or a mechanic
 
to do i
t,
 says Helena Ziolkowska.  "I'm the one with the training and it
 
is my responsibility to use it." Some younger women at home with small
 
children, often Polish school graduates, find Saturday school a
 
convenient way to keep up with previous acquaintances.
 
Personal motivation must be high to keep teachers in the schools.
 
Salaries often do not cover much more than the cost of gas and
 
childcare. One teacher said that during the 1960s she worked for  6 a
 
day and paid her babysitter $10. Salaries now range from $8 to $
10 per
 
hour.
 
Ninety percent of the teachers in the Polish Saturday schools were
 
born and educated in Poland. They range in age from twenty-five to
 
seventy. Newly arrived teachers help to keep contemporary Polish language
 
in the schools, while bilingual teachers raised in the United States
 
teach the classes for children from English-speaking homes.
 
The PTAA provides a constellation of services that supports the
 
educators and schools of the Polish schools network. Efforts in all
 
areas —textbook development, curriculum standardization, and teacher
 
accreditation and development--reflect the association's high standards
 
as professionals and its determination to provide an educational
 
experience through which students really master the language.
 
The Future of the Polish Saturday Schools
 
The Polish schools serve primarily their own ethnic community. In
 
the 1980s, however, one of their major concerns is their relationship
 
with the larger society. The schools would like to be recognized by the
 
Illinois State Board of Education so that their students would receive
 
1
7
 
c
redit f
or t
t
T
leir achievements in a s
econd l
anguage. State r
ecognition
 
would b
e a great help t
o Polish and other ethnic schools in a
ttracting
 
and keeping students.
 
Polish and o
ther e
thnic schools r
ealize t
hat t
hey are helping t
o
 
supply a resource —bilingual people--that i
s much in demand by government
 
and business. These schools help t
o f
ill the gap l
eft by d
eclining
 
foreign language education in American schools. Ethnic school o
fficials,
 
t
eachers, and parents are frustrated t
hat r
ecognition of their e
fforts is
 
coming s
o slowly. Several proposals t
o the State Board of Education over
 
the past t
en years have been rejected. Yet t
he fact that the i
ssue has
 
arisen a
t all is an indication of the increasing willingness on the part
 
of e
thnic communities to make a public case for r
ecognition o
f t
heir
 
contributions to the larger American society.
 
Will the  Polish Saturday schools c
ontinue t
o serve the needs o
f
 
Polonia? As the generation that founded the Polish Saturday schools
 
graduates their youngest children from high school in the early 1
980s,
 
the future i
s uncertain. Third- and fourth-generation Polish-American
 
families have not supported the Saturday schools s
trongly in t
he past.
 
Although there are significant numbers of more recent immigrants,
 
earlier immigrants perceive the attitudes t
oward Polish education o
f
 
these recent arrivals t
o be different from their own. As past PTAA
 
president Helena ZioLkowska noted:
 
People who came t
o this country from Europe in the
 
early '
40s and '
50s were survivors of World War II, and
 
they were very patriotic. And t
o them survival meant t
o
 
be Polish and t
o keep the Polish language, and faith,
 
and traditions. .  .  .  If these people were able to
 
transfer their motivations and feelings t
o the next
 
generation, then these children have children now, and
 
they send them to Polish schools.  But not all of them
 
succeeded. Some of the children went t
o Polish schools
 
because they had to, an once they got married,
 
sometimes to people of different nationality, they
 
didn't pay that much attention. .  .
 
But people who come fom Poland right now are of
 
different stock. .  .  .  Many o
f them don't feel that
 
they should keep up the Polish tradition. Not
 
everybody, but quite a big percentage, assimilates
 
1
8
 
very quickly. They don't t
alk Polish a
t home .
 .
 .  i
t's
 
very sad. .
 .
 .  I don't feel sorry for them, I feel
 
s
orry for their children, because they end up not
 
knowing anything about themselves.
 
I have a duty t
o give what I received t
o t
he next
 
generation. Language, culture, history, tradition,
 
national pride enrich your l
ife. But more than that,
 
i
f you know who you are and where you c
ome from, you
 
know what you're worth.
 
Conclusions
 
Perhaps the most important c
ontribution of the Polish schools i
s
 
that they help young people develop a positive sense of self-identity
 
that includes being Polish-American. Being ethnic in the United States i
s
 
a pervasive part of American society, one that does not disappear readily
 
even over several generations. As this fact becomes more widely
 
acknowledged, we need t
o seek ways t
o help people accept their ethnic
 
identity and use it positively. Polish and other e
thnic schools provide
 
a useful skill —knowledge of a second language--which can, in itself, be
 
a source of pride and achievement. We are also s
truggling with t
he
 
problem o
f having thousands o
f Americans go through life coping with
 
profound ambivalence and s
elf-doubt because they have been told t
hat
 
"being ethnic" i
s not a positive part of "being American."
 
Ethnic schools strengthen the fabric o
f American l

Patricia  Witkowski grew up in South Chicago, a neighborhood on

Patricia grew up speaking Polish at home. She also attended
 
parochial schools in predominantly Polish parishes, where the Polish
 
language was not encouraged. Growing up in the 1
960s, she was speaking
 
Polish and wearing pigtails "when i
t wasn't 'in'  to be ethnic."
 
Faced with countless messages and images which s
tressed the
 
negative stereotype of the "dumb Polack," Patricia easily felt
 
defensive about being Polish. So going to Polish Saturday school was
 
worth the aggravation of another day of school. Polish school
 
counteracted the negative stereotypes encountered elsewhere and
 
provided "a sense of history, culture, ethnic identity .
 .

 [and the
 
feeling that ]
 hey, I belong to a group of people and they are
 
important." That feeling gave Patricia the confidence to deal with the

Alliance (in which she served as Polish-language secretary of her
 
lodge), and the Sea League of America (for which she served as a

translator).  She values her fluency in the Polish language, a
 
noteworthy accomplishment for someone raised in the United States. But
 
more than anything else, she says, Polish Saturday school nourished a
 
sense of self—worth as a Polish American.
 
Witold Pawlikowski was just a small b
oy in 1
939 when the Soviet
 
Union invaded Poland and occupied his hometown. His father disappeared
 
without a trace, and the rest of the family was deported to Siberia.
 
After many months of great hardship some young Polish men were
 
recruited out of the Siberian camps to join the Polish army; they took
 
they families with them. In this way the Pawlikowski family reached the
 
Middle East. After the war they joined the demobilized Polish Army in
 
England. They later emigrated to the United States, where Witold served
 
in the U.S. Army. He settled in Chicago in 1
957. There he completed his
 
education as an engineer.
 
Because of his childhood experiences Mr. Pawlikowski felt
 
strongly that his child should know her Polish heritage of language,
 
history, and traditions. He wanted her to speak the language at home
 
and t
o know Polish grammar and read Polish literature. He and his wife
 
Yolanthe, the daughter of two teachers who take an active part in
 
Chicago's Polish Saturday schools, cajoled and supported their daughter
 
through twelve years of Polish school. Beata Pawlikowski is a graduate
 
of the General Casimir Pulaski Polish School.

The Witkowski and Pawljkowskj families are members of Chicago
 
Polonia, a strong ethnic community. They and many like them in
 
Chicago's diverse ethnic groups feel compelled to retain and pass on t
o
 
their children the traditions, values, and symbols that are part of
 
t
rieir ethnic identity.
 
Chicago ethnic groups educate their children as ethnic Americans
 
in many ways, from family training to church activities, lodge events,
 
and formal ethnic schooling. Ethnic-heritage schools are found in a
 
least twenty Chicago communities, and perhaps many more. Chicago
 
Polonia, one of the largest ethnic groups in the area, claims over
 
750,000 people of Polish descent and supports a network of fifteen
 
Polish Saturday schools.
 
The Saturday schools supported by Chicago Polonia are coordinated
 
by an umbrella organization of professional Polish educators, the
 
Polish Teachers Association in America, Inc. (PTAA). The schools,
 
generally called Polish language schools or Polish Saturday schools,
 
meet on Saturdays and offer instruction in Polish language and history
 
for students from kindergarten through high school. Polish high school
 
graduates speak Polish fluently and have a command of the written
 
language, literary traditions, and Polish history. Students also gain a
 
sense of confidence and pride in being Polish American. Maintaining
 
these schools is a community effort which requires a great deal of
 
energy.
 
Early Polish Education in Chicago
 
At the turn of the century, when the great wave of immigration
 
brought thousands of Poles t
o the Chicago area, Poland did not exist as
 
a nation. Poland had been partitioned in 1
795 among Russia, Prussia,
 
and Austria, and ethnic Poles referred t
o themselves as "Russian
 
Poles," or "Austrian Poles." They often clung t
o their Roman Catholic
 
religion as an important ethnic marker.
 
Language, ethnicity, regional origin, and religion, rather than
 
nationality, were the distinctive characteristics of this early group
 
of Polish immigrants. They were mostly peasants with little formal
 
education, who came t
o the United States for economic reasons, working
 
hard so that their children might struggle up the ladder of success in
 
America. Part of that struggle was educational, and education for many
 
of these children began in Polish parochial schools.
 
Poles in Chicago sought to establish Catholic parishes that were
 
Polish in character. They built many churches and established schools
 
with them.
 In the parish schools, where many or nearly all of the
 
students came from Polish-speaking homes and the teaching nuns also
 
spoke Polish, the Polish language was part of the curriculum almost
 
more by default than by design.

depending on the school or even
 
Each school was free to determine its
 
and schools seem to have varied widely;
 
the individual teacher, students might
 
study only religious subjects or most of the curriculum in Polish. The
 
Polish instruction in the parish schools seems to have stemmed from the
 
R
 
fact t
hat the teachers and s
tudents were all of Polish descent, r
ather
 
than from an explicit desire t
o impart t
o students a mastery o
f the
 
Polish language or a need t
o instill articulated values related t
o t
he
 
traditions of Poland.

o r
id the parishes of "foreign"
 
association and a general pressure on immigrants t

contributed to the decline.
 
Polish immigration t
o Chicago was halted in the 1
920s by
 
restrictive United States immigration laws. Isolated from Poland for
 
almost t
hirty years, the Polish community evolved t
heir own
 
Polish-American traditions. "Chicago Polish" arose a
s American-born
 
children learned t
o speak the Polish language based on the various
 
re-ional dialects spoken by their parents and teachers. Immigrants

arriving a
fter World War II were surprised to f
ind many "archaic" and
 
and grammatical constructions preserved in the speech of the
 
established Polish-American community.
 
The thousands of new immigrants who flooded the country from the
 
refugee camps of Europe were to have a profound impact on the nature of
 
Chicago Polonia. The new refugees coming from a Poland briefly reunited
 
between the world wars had been raised with intense f
eelings o
f Polish
 
T
 
nationalism. These f
eeling were r
einforced by t
he knowledge that t
ney
 
could not go back t
o Poland. They felt disinherited, which engendered a
 
deep need t

f what i
t means t
o be
 
Polish.
 
Many o
f the new r
efugees were educated professionals. For t
hem
 
knowledge o
f the contemporary, standard Polish language was an imprtant
 
attribute o
f being Polish. They wanted their children t
o speak the
 
language and learn Polish history and national traditions in a more
 
s
tructured way than they c
ould provide in t
ile home. Their symbols of
 
being Polish differed markedly from those of the established
 
Polish-American community.
 
There arose a n
eed f
or a new kind of Polish e
ducation not supplied
 
in the parochial schools. Many of the new arrivals sent their children
 
t
o Polish parochial schools for their regular education, but they also
 
felt a need to create special Polish schools that concentrated on
 
Polish education. In the 1
950s, as Polish cultural education i
n
 
parochial schools declined, the Polish Saturday schools emerg
 
History of Chicago's Polish Saturday Schools
 
World War Il influenced the development of the Chicago's Polish
 
Saturday schools. The f
ounders of the Polish Teachers Association in
 
America (
PTAA) and a great many'of the teachers and parents currently
 
d
t i ve  in the Polish scnools were adults or young children in Pola:
 
during World War II. After the war many Poles found themselves in
 
either in Displaced Persons Camps (also known as "DP" or refugee camps)
 
in Germany or in temporary camps in England for those associated with
 
the Polish Arrny.1
 Schools were set up by Polish t
eachers in both the
 
German and English camps. The premise of the schools in Germany was
 
that the children would be returning to Poland, so the regular Polish
 
curriculum was used. In England a sort of bilingual school system
 
developed, so that s
tudents could continue their s
tudies in either
 
English or Polish universities; Polish language, culture, and history
 
were taught in Polish and all other subjects in English. That division
 
of curriculum influenced the Saturday schools —in Chicago students
 
attend parochial or public schools for their "regular" education and
 
Polish school for "Polish" subjects.
 
Many teachers who worked in the camp schools later helped
 
establish Polish Saturday schools in the countries where they settled:
 
the United States, England, Canada, Australia, and Argentina. Polish
 
teachers' organizations formed in the camps were models for later
 
groups. Relationships formed in the camps were also often longlasting,
 
carrying over to the immigrants' new homes.
 
Many Poles made their way to the United States when the Displaced
 
Persons Commission of Congress opened the way in 1948. Thousands
 
settled in Chicago during the late 1
940s and 1
950s. Many of their needs
 
iDuring the war the Polish Government in Exile established i
tself in
 
England; the Polish Army fought with the British Army. When the war
 
ended the Polish Army demobilized in England.

were met in Chicago by existing Polish churches and other social and
 
fraternal organizations. The new arrivals soon began to develop
 
supplemental Polish cultural programs, however, both for adults and for
 
the children.
 
Two Saturday schools emerged in the early 1
950s: General Casimir
 
Pulaski Polish School and Thadeusz Kosciuzko Polish School. Both are
 
still in operation, offering a program of Polish education through the
 
high-school level. The schools met in the Polish Triangle, where
 
Ashland, Division, and Milwaukee Avenues meet on the near northwest
 
side of Chicago, until the early 1970s. They served thousands of
 
students; Pulaski, for example, had 1
,000 students in 1
970s. The
 
neighborhood changed fundamentally with the John F
. Kennedy Expressway,
 
however. Chicago Polonia saved two magnificent Polish churches from
 
being razed, but the character of the neighborhood did not survive. The
 
city built low-income housing and Polish residents began to move out.
 
The neighborhood is now primarily Hispanic, although some Polish
 
churches, organizations, and businesses remain. New immigrants from
 
Poland do settle in the neighborhood, but many find it more comfortable
 
further north on Milwaukee Avenue. As families moved out of the old
 
neighborhood, it became increasingly difficult for students to attend
 
Saturday school there. Some families had reservations about safety in
 
the area. Enrollment soon dropped.
 
The significant numbers of Polish families settling in new
 
communities, mostly in the far northwest Chicago neighborhoods and in
 
the northwest and western suburbs, necessitated the founding of new
 
9
 
Polish schools.  In the late 1
960s schools were established in
 
Hammond, Indiana (
just across the Indiana-Illinois state line from
 
Chicago) and in Cicero, Illinois, a suburb just west of Chicago. Nine
 
new schools were opened during the 1
970s, and two new Chicago-area
 
schools have started s
ince 1
980.
 
In 1
980 Polish Saturday schools enrolled around 2
,000 s
tudents.
 
Enrollment had increased to 3
,000 by 1981-1982. The steady growth of
 
newer, smaller schools may have contributed to the increase. PTAA
 
administrators suggested two other factors that may have influenced the
 
marked growth in enrollment: the election of a Polish Pope and the
 
struggle of the Solidarity Union in Poland, which has generated
 
worldwide public support and sympathy.
 
All Polish schools are named for famous Poles, underscoring the
 
independent, national orientation of the schools. The two earliest
 
schools were named for the first well known Polish
 
Americans--Revolutionary War generals Casimir Pulaski and Thadeusz
 
Kosciuzko. Other schools are named after popular figures from World War
 
II, such as St. Maksymilian Kolbe and General Anders. Copernicus,
 
Paderewski, Sienkiewicz, and Chopin schools are named for famous
 
scientists and artists, while Maria Konopnicka School commemorates a
 
much-loved poet. The names of the St. Maksymilian and Pope John Paul II
 
hools (
there are several named after the Pope) definitely have
 
L
ish rather than religious significance;  there are no schools named
 
for other saints or popes.

Case Study: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
General Casimir Pulaski Polish School offers classes from first
 
grade through high school. It is one of the four Polish high schools
 
fed by the more numerous Polish grammar schools in the Chicago area.
 
Pulaski School met in various locations in the Polish Triangle
 
from the early 1950s until 1978. It then moved t- - - - - and presently
 
uses the S
t. Wenceslaus Roman Catholic parish school building located
 
at 3415 North Lawndale Avenue. The school grew rapidly, from 200
 
students in 1
954 to 850 in 1
961  (when high school classes formed) and
 
1
,000 in 1970 (
just before the dispersal of the schools?). In 1981-1982
 
350 students were enrolled.
 
The parish school hall in the basement of the building i
s used for
 
school assemblies and as a
 
the two upper floors. On a
 
usually several parents in
 
parents' waiting room; the classrooms are on
 
regular Saturday school day there are
 
the hall helping with school business,
 
visitng, or reading the paper. Coffee and homemade pastries such as
 
ponczki--round pieces of dough which are fried, glazed, and sometimes
 
filled with jelly —are available.
 
Ten classes meet in the morning and in the afternoon. First
 
through eighth grades all meet duirng both the morning and afternoon
 
sessions. In addition, two of the high school classes meet before noon
 
1
1
 
and two meet in the a
fternnon. Students who participate in
 
extracurricular activities, such as singing, poetry recitation, and
 
dancing, either stay late or come earlier than their class sessions.
 
Classes and Curriculum: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
The primary goal of the school i
s t
o teach the Polish language. To
 
this end, all grades s
tress language skills and all classes are
 
conducted entirely in Polish. In first through third grade reading and
 
writing are the main subjects.  Some Polish history and traditions are
 
introduced, primarily through legends and stories told to the class.
 
Polish-language skills are stressed in the intermediate grades, along
 
with literature. Polish history and geography are taught as separate
 
subjects. The high school grades emphasize the study of Polish
 
literature and history.
 
Although all of the s
tudents speak some Polish, command of the
 
language varies greatly. Everyone acknowledges that the students are
 
all most comfortable speaking English. One first-grade teacher felt
 
that she essentially presents Polish as a second language. If students
 
persist with Polish s
tudies, however, and graduate from a Polish high
 
school, they are expected to speak and read Polish fluently, and be
 
able to write well. The high school classes cover high-school level
 
m
iterial in Polish. The school i
s particularly proud of its high-school
 
1
2
 
Discipline is one theme stressed by parents, teachers, and school
 
officials. In Polish and other European educational systems maintaining
 
a certain distance between teacher and students is traditionally part
 
of the way students express respect for the teacher. Continuing that
 
tradition i
s one of the goals of the Pulaski School. Classes are quiet
 
and students stand by their desks to respond. Teachers remain
 
affectionate towards the youngest students, however, and cordial with
 
older pupils.
 
Teachers: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
Teachers at the Pulaski School range from young, recent
 
immigrants, like  
to Mrs. Zurczak, who celebrated her fiftieth
 
year of teaching in 1982. Only the first grade teacher, Mrs. Helena
 
Sromek, holds both Polish and American teaching credentials. One of the
 
high school teachers, Dr. Janina Kras, holds a Ph.D. from Jagellonian
 
University, Poland's oldest and most-respected institution of higher
 
education.
 
School Administration: General Casimir Pulaski Polish School
 
Like each school in the network, Pulaski maintains its own
 
independent school administration. A Parent Teacher Association (
PTA)
 
elects the school board. Tuition covers the majority of school
 
1
3
 
expenses, with the remaining funds coming from contributions by Polish
 
organizations (channeled through the PTAA) and fund-raising efforts by
 
parents. Parents are very active in running the school. They serve on
 
the school board,  sew costumes for school presentations, and bake for
 
the yearly fund-raiser.
 
Some Polish schools have chosen to affiliate with other Polish
 
charitable organizations, such as the Polish National Alliance or the
 
Polish Roman Catholic Union, which then help to support the school.
 
Pulaski School, like the majority of Polish schools, has chosen t
o
 
remain unaffiliated t
o maintain full control over school affairs.
 
School Administration: Polish Saturday Schools
 
Each Polish school makes its own arrangements for housing, usually
 
renting from a parochial school, negotiates rent, and determines
 
teacher salaries. With fifteen schools in the network, arrangements are
 
quite diverse, reflecting the economic situation of school parents and
 
the support offered by the parish, among other factors.
 
The PTAA addresses the shared concerns of the schools. One major
 
concern i
s the unique curriculum needs of ethnic schools. Language and
 
other texts developed for use in the home country to do not relate to
 
the experience of children growing up in the United States, while books
 
developed for students with no knowledge of a language are
 
1
4
 
inappropriate for children who speak the language at home. Therefore,
 
ethnic schools are forced to adapt books which are not suited t
o their
 
needs or t
o write new ones.
 
For many years individual teachers in the Polish Saturday schools
 
tried t
o resolve the problem of acquiring useful teaching materials as
 
best they could. In the mid-1960s the PTAA began t
o sponsor the
 
development of appropriate texts. Their first project was Polska Mowa
  
(The Polish Language), an introduction to the Polish language for older
 
children and adults. Now in its eighth edition, Polska Mowa i
s used
 
not only in Polish Saturday schools in the United States, Canada,
 
England, and Australia, but in college and high school Polish language
 
classes.
 
Later projects focused on developing readers in literature and
 
history for elementary and junior high school grades. High school
 
classes can often use high school literature texts from Poland. History
 
texts, however, are a very sensitive subject, since texts from Poland
 
written since the Communist takeover are considered unacceptable. With
 
this in mind, the PTAA developed a four-volume History of Poland.
 
Texts are also exchanged with Polish schools in other countries where
 
similar curriculum-development efforts have taken place.
 
As many new Polish schools opened in the 1970s, the PTAA also saw
 
the need for a standardized curriculum, to aid teachers and allow
 
students to move more easily between schools if they needed to. The
 
PTAA has established guidelines for the types of classes to be offered:
 
1
5
 
kindergarten; eight years of elementary school for Polish-speaking
 
children; four years of high school for Polish-speaking children;
 
classes for children who do not speak Polish; and a singing, music,
 
dance, and theater program. Detailed curriculum guidelines for each
 
year are being developed. The PTAA's efforts to develop appropriate
 
texts and standardized curriculum reflects their desire to create an
 
educational experience through which s
tudents really master the
 
language, rather than just having the opportunity to spend time in a
 
Polish -oriented environment.
 
The PTAA also provides other services which b
enefit all of t
t
ie
 
schools. The group functions as a professional organization for all
 
teachers of Polish descent, even those not teaching in Polish schools.
 
The PTAA sponsors activities to promote Polish-language teaching,
 
notably popular essay and poetry recitation contests. In 1
982 a poetry
 
recitation contest attracted enthusiastic participation from 800
 
students from Polish Saturday schools, public and private high school
 
Polish c
lasses, and area colleges. The PTAA also exchanges reports and
 
textbooks with similar teachers' organizations in Canada and England.
 
The PTAA offers a small lending library of teaching ai.:
 
Polish Saturday schools, including pictures, slide-tape programs, and
 
equipment. In addition, the organization supports the activities of
 
many of the other Chicago-area Polish institutions. Polish
 
organizations and individual Poles contribute in turn to the PTA
-A.
 
Funds from a major annual fund-raiser--the Day of Polish Schools
 
Picnic —are channeled by the PTAA to the many Polish schools.

Teachers: Polish Saturday Schools
 
Ninety percent of the teachers in the Polish Saturday schools were
 
born and educated in Poland; most hold specialized teaching certifcates
 
or advanced degrees. In Poland teaching is a highly respected i
f poorly
 
paid profession. Many of the teachers in Chicago find themselves unable
 
to teach in American schools and must take other jobs to support
 
themselves. Being unable to work in their profession is a blow to their
 
self-esteem, so immigrant teachers seek out the Polish schools. There
 
they can be themselves; some say that they only feel like people on
 
Saturdays. Others teach because they feel strongly that they should not
 
waste specialized training and talents. In addition, some younger women
 
at home with small children find Saturday school a convenient part-time
 
job.
 
Personal motivation must be high to keep teachers in the schools.
 
The salaries often have not covered much more than the cost of gas and
 
childcare. One teacher noted that during the 1
960s she worked for $6 a
 
day and paid her babysitter $10.  Salaries now range from $6 to $
10 per
 
hour.
 
Teachers range in age from 25 to 70. The many younger, newly
 
arrived teachers help to keep contemporary Polish language in the
 
schools. Those raised in the United States, who are native speakers of
 
English and Polish, teach the classes for English speakers.
 
1
7
 
The PTAA is very concerned about upholding s
tandards and verifies
 
the credentials of teachers who apply for positions. The organization
 
sponsors teacher-training and in-service seminars, and has co-sponsored
 
courses t
o help new arrivals qualify for American teaching credentials.
 
Parents: Polish Saturday Schools
 
Parents are the core of tne Polish schools. Post-war immigrant
 
parents wanted their Polish-speaking children to become literate in
 
Polish and to know Polish history and culture. They felt that
 
establishing a formal educational environment would be better than
 
trying to teach such subjects at home. The relative importance of these
 
factors varies, of course, from family to family, as does the
 
commitment to speaking Polish at home and to helping children with
 
Polish-school homework.
 
Parents who send their children to Polish school pay a sma1
 
tuition fee. They also often make a considerable sacrifice of t
ime and
 
effort, giving up their only free day for shopping and errands. Getting
 
the children to the school requires dedication and motivation when it
 
may be as much as a 60-mile round trip for suburban residents. (The
 
schools recognize these difficulties. At the 1982 Pulaski High School
 
graduation banquet a young woman who lived in a distant suburb received
 
1
8
 
a special award for perfect attendance.) Parents also support the
 
school through volunteer activities and attend special programs a
t the
 
school at Christmas and Easter.
 
The high priority set on education in Polish school families i
s
 
reflected in their desire to send their children to college. Clippings
 
in the Pulaski school's scrapbook attest to its pride in the
 
higher-education achievements of the students.
 
Students: Polish Saturday Schools
 
Students in the Saturday schools seem to agree on why they
 
attend, at least initially. "My parents made me" is a frequent comment.
 
Giving up Saturday leisure-time activities, having an extra day of
 
school, and being expected to complete more homework is hard for the
 
students. Those who s
tick with it either "
just get used to it" and quit
 
fighting the inevitable, or really get interested. The parents'
 
motivation is often the deciding factor.
 
Polish school is a challenging experience, especially in high
 
school, when the material catches up with the actual age group and
 
students use high-school-level texts from Poland. "Only the dedicated
 
and motivated students really survive and go through high school," says
 
1
9
 
one school administrator of the Polish high school graduates. "But once
 
they finish you really can converse with them fluently .
 .
 .  they have
 
good knowledge of literature, and write  good papers."
 
Older students raise two different reasons for attending the
 
schools. One group attended to learn the Polish language to enhance
 
their success in college or in a career. Other students who had visited
 
relatives in Poland, as many had, cited the usefulness and satisfaction
 
of being able to speak Polish with their family and get around in
 
another country.
 
The Future of the Polish Saturday Schools
 
The Polish sct-i
ools have operated primarily within their own
 
communities. In the 1
980s, however, one of their major concerns is
 
their relationship with the larger society. The schools would like t
o
 
be recognized by the Illinois State Board of Education so that their
 
students would receive credit for their achievements in the Polish
 
language, a circumstance that would benefit students in all ethnic
 
heritage schools in the state. State recognition would greatly aid
 
Polish and other ethnic schools in attracting and retaining students.
 
I
t would also encourage students to continue through the high school
 
programs offered by the ethnic schools.
 
20
 
Polish and other ethnic schools realize that they are helping to
 
supply a resource —bilingual people--that is much in demand by
 
government and business. These schools help to fill the gap left by
 
declining foreign-language education in American schools. Ethnic school
 
officials, teachers, and parents are frustrated that recognition of
 
their efforts is coming so slowly. Yet, the fact that the issue arises
 
at all is an indication of the increasing sophistication and
 
participation by ethnic communities in the larger American society.
 
Will the Polish Saturday schools continue to serve the needs of
 
Polonia? As the generation that founded the Polish Saturday schools
 
graduates their youngest children from high school in the early 1
980s,
 
the future is uncertain. Third- and fourth-generation Polish-American
 
families have not strongly supported the Saturday schools in the past.
 
The post-war immigrants perceive the attitudes of the most recent
 
arrivals towards Polish education to be different from their own. As
 
past PTAA President Helena Ziolkowska says:
 
People who came to this country from Europe in the
 
early '40s and '
50s were survivors of World War II, and
 
they were very patriotic. And to them survival meant to

traditions  .  .  .  .  If these people were able to
 
transfer their motivations and feelings to the next
 
generation, then these children have children now and
 
they send them to Polish schools. But not all of them
 
succeeded. Some of the children went to Polish schools
 
because they had to, and once they got married,
 
sometimes to people of different nationality, they
 
didn't pay that much attention .  .  .
 
But people who come from Poland right now are of
 
different stock .  .  .  .  Many of then don't feel that
 
they should keep the Polish tradition. Not everybody,
 
but quite a big percentage, assimilates very quickly.

a haps the most important contribution of the Polish schools i
s
 
that they help young people develop a positive sense of self-identity,
 
which includes being Polish American. Being ethnic in the United S
tates
 
i
s a pervasive part o
f American society, one that does not disappear
 
readily even over several generations. As this fact becomes more widely
 
acknowledged, we need t
o seek ways t
o help people accept and use their
 
ethnic identity positively. Polish and other e
thnic schools provide a
 
useful skill--knowledge of a foreign language--which can in i
tself be a
 
source o
f pride and achievement. But we are also s
truggling with the
 
problem of having thousands o

with profound ambivalence and self-doubt because they have been t

that "being ethnic" i
s not a positive part of "being American." Ethnic
 
schools s
trengthen the fabric of American life if they help young
 
people t
o accept, validate, and integrate their varying heritages into
 
their c
oncepts of being American.

4iktor Barczyk of the PTAA introduced me to the schools and accompanied
 
me on several occasions. Helena Ziolkowska, past PTAA President, not
 
only gave generously of her time during the project but has read
 
subsequent drafts of my report with a critical eye. James Ylisela
 
offered valuable suggestions in drafting this final version.
