Not until Lomax went t

TRIBUTE FOR BESS LO MAX
 
HA WES
 
Mr. FELL, Mr. President, i
t I
s with
 
the greatest pride that I
 r
ise t
oday t
o
 
s
alute an outstanding American who,
 
for the past 15 years, has s
erved this
 
Nation by her com mitment t
o the a
rts.
 
Her s
ervice has enriched a
ll our l
ives.
 
I
 am speaking of Bess Lomax Hawes
 
whO will be honored on January 31,
 
1992 by the National Endowment f
or
 
the Arts, where she has worked with
 
much d
istinction these past 1
5 years.
 
On January 31, Ms. Hawes will r
eceive
 
the accolades of her colleagues a
t the
 
Endow ment and f
ro m members of the
 
Nations' Counci
l on the Arts as she r
e-
t
ires
'
 f
ro m the agency.
 
Mr. President, Bess Lomax Hawes
 
was born I
n Austin, TX i
n 1
921. Her
 
f
a t
her. John Lomax, grew up I
n the
 
l
ate 1800* I
n west Texas on a
 spur o
f
 
the Chisholm Trail. He grew up adniir.
 
I
ng the songs, t
ales, and other l
ore o
f
 
the hard-working cowboys o
f the Lone
 
Star State. John Lomax went on to
 
become a professor of English a
t the
 
University or l
'estui, a b
iuikts, the d
l'
 
r
ector o
f the Archive o
f American
 
Folkaong a
t the L
ibrary o
f Congress,
 
and a p
ioneer i
n collecting American
 
folklore. He championed the worth
 
and d
ignity of American f
olk artists.
 
He was a
 great d
iscoverer and preserv-
er of that part of our national charac-
t
er that i
s uniquely American.
 
John Lomax passed on h
is l
ove o
f
 
folk art to h
is f
our children; and Bess,
 
the youngest, and her o
lder brother
 
Alan, made careers out o
f that admira-
t
ion  f
or  grassroots  America.  Alan
 
Lomax collected and preserved the
 
best o
f American f
olk art, sharing i
t
 
with the Nation through r
ecordings,
 
radio, publications, and l
ater t
elevision
 
that made great American f
olk artists
 
such as Jelly' Roll Morton, Huddle
 
"Leadbel
ly" Leadbetter, and Roscoe
 
Holcomb * valued part o
f our national
 
heritage.
 
Bess Lomax Hawes r o possessed
 
the foresight t
o we that he future of
 
American culture and l
ife l
ay i
n the
 
minds, bands, and voices of ordinary
 
Americans. She had the wisdom t
o
 
bring this t
o the a
ttention of a
 broad
 
audience. As a
 member of the A
lmanac
 
Singers,  a
long  with  her  husband,
 
Butch Hawes, Woody Guthrie, Pete
 
Seeger, and o
thers, she p
ioneered the
 
f
olk song revival that a
ttracted mil-
l
ions o
f Americans to Afro- and Anglo-
American song. he a
b
ored "Charl
ie
 
on the MTA" which was r
ecorded by
 
the Kingston Trio and beca me an
 
American song favorite. She produced
 
f
i
lms l
ike "OeoigIa Sea I
sland S
ing-
e
rs," "Pizza Pi s
sa Daddy-O" on b
lack 
childrens  
 and "Say, Old Man,
 
Can You Play the Fiddle?" on a Mis-
souri 
 
 l
iving in California. In
 
1
972. with Bessie Jones, she coauth
-
ored "Step i
t Down: Chun m Plays,
 
Songs and Stories Foui the Afro-
American Heritage." That work I
s s
till
 
a
 s
tandard of f
olklore l
iterature.
 
But,  Mr.  President, perha p
a her
 
most profound, f
ar-reaching and l
ong-
l
asting contributions t
o Amer
 
l
c
a
z
i
 Cul-
ture would come l
ater
. In 1
115 and
 
1
978, Bess Haves' work on the Smith-
sonian Bicentennial Festival of Ameri-
can Folkilfe p
layed an Important role
 
i
n setting the s
tage f
or a
 new national
 
e
ffort t
o I
dentify, am
ist, and eefebrate
 
the extraordinary d
iversity of Ameri-
c
an f
olk art. In 1971, she j
oined the
 
National Endowment f
or the Arts and
 
developed I
ts I
nitial e
fforts at support-
i
ng American f
olk arts i
nto a full-
f
ledged  d
iscipline  progra m  at  the
 
agency. Through her v
ision and per-
sonal dedication, a
 national network of
 
support f
or f
olk arti
sts was c
reated at
 
the State and l
ocal l
evels. Her I
dea of
 
a progra m to re
cognize our Nation's
 
most outstanding t
raditional artists
 
beca me r
eality when, i
n 1982, the Na-
t
ional Heritage Fellowships were c
re-
a
ted. Ten years l
ater, they r
emain the
 
Nations h
ighest honor f
or our f
olk
 
a
rtists.
 
Mr. President, the e
fforts o
f the
 
Lomax f
amily t
o make American f
olk
 
expression a central part of our na-
t
ional l
ife a
lready spans nearly the
 
entire 1
0th c
entury. And Bess Lomax's
 
work w
ill surely l
ive on f
ar I
nto the
 
2
1st c
entury. She has helped change
 
the f
ace of American l
ife. She has r
ec-
ognized and helped t
ens of thousands
 
o
f our Nation's f
olk artists, thereby
 
enriching our own perception of our
 
s
elves a
s Americans.
 
Mr. President, I
 appreciate this op-
portunity t
o present a brief profile of
 
a woman who has devoted herself t
o
 
the arts, who has preserved and gained
 
r
ecognition f
or an important s
egment
 
o
f our national cultural heritage. She
 
has im measurably improved our whole
 
world through these contributions. I
 
am c

o Bess Lomax Hawes

The p

"Better  b

The r

 For t

o h
is y

t t

o h
is position t
he knowl-

 professional oboist and c

A graduate of t

Music  a
t  t

Gnam held t
he principal oboe chair i

he

he expects t

I'm

Gnam s
ays, explaining h
is ability t

Q
How d
id you g
et i
nvolved i

a
rts ad ministrator a

s a

I
 r
ealized v
ery e
arly i
n my c
areer a
s a
 chamber
 
musician —in 1
962 o
r s
o —that you c
annot
 
s
imply p
lay your i
nstrument. You have t
o
 
have management. And p
rofessional manage-
ment costs about 20 p
ercent o
f your f
ee. Take
 
2
0 percent f
rom t
he u
sual $
500 f
ee f
or a

end up s
ubsidizing your own a
rt f
orm —which
 
i
s what most chamber g
roups do e
ven t
o t
his

So out o

ecause s
he knew I
 had
 
an administrative a
s well a
s a p

background and was concerned about what
 
was happening i

decided t
hat I
 could t
ake a
 portion o

and do s

At t

Do you expect t

No. At t

Absolutely, t

f t

f g

performance  opportunities,  and  f

'm an

s
 
t

I
t definitely  i

.  The  g

'm t

specially  of  t

o

I

's i

ecause i
t

I

ose an ensemble
 
o

And e

Q
So, i

ense i
t
's more important t
hat
 
t
he Endowment g
ive s

han t
hat
 
i
t g
ive a
 c
ertain amount?
 
That's g
enerally t
rue, but not entirely. The
 
small  g
roups —chamber music, j
azz, n
ew
 
music e
nsembles —and s
olo r
ecitalists have a
 
v
ery hard t
ime g
etting booked by p
resenters
 
who o
ften don't want t
o t
ake chances. But
 
t
hese musicians c
an't make a l
iving p
laying
 
i
n a l

oom and p
racticing. They r
eally
 
have t
o be hustlers, t
elling p
resenters. "We're
 
t
errific.  Here's our r
epertoire l
i

where we've p
layed. Here a
re our r
eviews."
 
And e
ven when t
hey g
et booked, a
s I

t
hey don't e
arn v

hey n
eed
 
our s

he
 
r
ecognition.
 
Q
You  mentioned  f
inding  a
lternative
 
means o
f g
etting f
unds. What do you
 
have i
n mind?
 
We i
n t
he Music Program have b
egun an
 
enormous amount o
f a
ctivity w
ith t
he Ford
 
Foundation, t
he  Rouse Company, ARCO,
 
Exxon, t
he Rockefeller Foundation, t
he C

Michael  Paul  Foundation.  Xerox,  and
 
o
thers. There i
s g
reat potential f
or more
 
corporate s
upport, but s
omebody has t
o go
 
out a
fter i
t
. You have t
o convince corpora-
t
ions i
t i
s going t
o b
enefit t
hem, t
he a
rts
 
o
rganization, and t
he c
ommunity.
 
My p
redecessor, Ezra Laderman. and I
,
 f
or
 
e
xample, i
nitiated a p
rogram o
f composer
 
r
esidencies.  We  went  t
o t

Foundation and Exxon w
ith t
he i
dea, and

"There i
s
 s

My f
irst i

i
s
 t
o c

t
hat would h
ighlight

got t
he Meet t
he Composer o
rganization i
n
 
on i
t t
o ad minister t
he p
rogram. This y
ear
 
s
even composers i
n r
esidence a
re w
ith major
 
o

hrough t
his p
rogram (which r
e-
c
eives $50,000 f
rom t
he Endowment and
 
$
350,000 f
rom e
ach o
f t
he o
ther s
ponsors).
 
Next y
ear and t
he f
ollowing y
ear. I
 hope
 
t
here will be many more s
uch r
esidencies.
 
The Endowment's important r
ole, t
hough,
 
was not p
rimarily a
s a f
under. I
t was a
s t
he
 
i
nitiator o
f t
he p
roject. Without u
s, t
he whole
 
t
hing might n
ever have happened. I
t
's not
 
how much we g
ive. T
ime and again, once a
 
partnership l
ike t
his has gotten s
tarted, t
he
 
r
atio o
f o
ther s
upport t
o ours has become
 
t
en-to-one o
r twenty-to-one.
 
Another d
imension t
o t
his composers' p
ro-
g
ram i
s t
he possibility f
or expansion and e
n-
l
argement on t
he l
ocal l
evel.  Composers
 
s
hould b
ecome i
nvolved not only w
ith t
he
 
s
ymphony o
rchestra, but a
lso w
ith t
he whole
 
co mmunity —working  with  choral  and
 
c
hamber g
roups,  g
iving  t
hem advice on
 
contemporary p
rogramming, doing guest ap-
pearances  w
ith  t
hem, and working w
ith
 
s
tudent musical ensembles.
 
Q
Do you have any additional i
deas t
hat
 
will put your personal s
tamp on t
he
 
Program now t
hat you a
re t
he d
irector?
 
I
 hope t
o s
tart s
ome n
ew p
rograms t
hat w
ill
 
g
ive musical g
roups new exposure. As I
 s
aid,
 
I
 don't s
ee any need f
or n
ew c
ategories i
n
 
t
he d
isciplines o
f music, but t
here i
s s
t
ill a
 
g
reat n
eed f
or h
elp i
n g
etting n
ew music on
 
r
adio and t
elevision.
 
My f
irst i
dea— which i
s s
t
ill i
n t
he f
orma-
t
ive s
tage —is t
o c
reate a
 TV s
eries. I
t would
 
consist o
f t
hree o
r f
our s
egments on public
 
TV, and would b
e j
ointly f
unded by a
 f
ounda-
t
ion, a
 c
orporation, t
he Music Program, and
 
t
he Lndownent  Media Arts l
rogia i
n I
 h
e
 
s
eries would h
ighlight chamber music, choral
 
music, j
azz, new music, and composers. The
 
g
roups f
eatured would come f
rom a
round t
he
 
country —not  f
rom  t
he  L
incoln  Center-
Kennedy Center environment. Maybe we'd
 
have chamber music f
rom Santa Fe, choral
 
music f
rom Minnesota o
r S
t. Louis, j
azz
 
f
rom Detroit o
r New Orleans o
r Atlanta.
 
The American composer would b
e a k
ey
 
component, t
oo. The composer would have
 
an i
nterview during t
he p
rogram, a
s would
 
t
he p
erformers. Maybe t
here would be a
 part
 
devoted t
o r
ehearsal, and another part s
how-
i
ng young p
eople's p
resentations. The whole
 
p
rogram, a
s I
 envision i
t, would b
e a
 k
ind o
f
 
Charles Kuralt "On t
he Road w
ith American
 
Music."
 
This i
s important t
o me b
ecause I
 t
hink
 
most Americans have come t
o a
ccept t
he
 
media a
s t
heir way o
f f
inding out what's
 
going on i
n t
he world, what's important i
n
 
t
he world. Every day we s
aw what was hap-
pening i
n t
he Falkland I
slands during t
he
 
war t
here. I
t would b
e g
reat t
o have f
ive
 
minutes e
very day devoted t
o t
he a
rts.
 
Q
What about t
he danger o
f spending t
oo
 
much money on TV —of complaints t
hat
 
money devoted t
o v
ery expensive media
 
p
rojects s
hould be going d
irectly t
o t
he a
rtists
 
and a
rts o
rganizations?
 
That i
s a v
ery s
hort-sighted v
iew. At t
he
 
moment we p
rovide, f
or s
ome o
rganizations,
 
two p
ercent o
f t
heir entire budget. I
f we t
ook
 
half o
f t
hat —one percent, s
ay —and u
sed i
t
 
f
or media and e
ducational p
rojects, we would
 
b
e doing t
he whole f
ield i
nfinitely more
 
good. There a
re exa mples we c
an l
ook t
o both
 
i
n music and outside o
f music. Look a
t golf.
 
There wouldn't be t
he people t
hronging t
o
 
t
he t
ournaments i
f i
t weren't f
or TV. Music
 
has had i
t
s t
elevision moments, t
oo, o
f course.
 
Charismatic f
igures l
ike Leonard Bernstein,
 
I
saac S
tern, and l
tzhak Perlman have done a
 
l
ot, t
hrough media exposure, t
o popularize
 
s
erious music. But what popularity music
 
has t
oday i
s s
t
ill p
retty much confined t
o t
he
 
s
ymphonic and opera f
ields. We n
eed t
o work
 
on w

ame k
ind o
f a

or
 
o

ields o
f music.
 
Q
You mentioned new educational p
roj-
e
cts. Do you have s
omething s
pecif
ic i
n
 
mind?
 
Yes. Any educational p
roject t
he Endow-
ment b
ecomes i

n has t
o b
e v
ery
 
well-defined and small-scale b
ecause o
f t

l
imited dollars available t

 do t

i

f

A Federal agency advised by t

National Council on t

As many of you may already know,  Bess Hawes will soon retire
 
after 15 years as head of the Folk Arts Program.
 Her commitment
 
and passion for the traditional arts have been evident from her
 
first days here,  and she has served the agency and the field with
 
distinction.
 She leaves  in place a vital support network,
 
particularly with the state arts agency folk art apprenticeships,
 
and the highly respected and much cherished National Heritage
 
Awards.
 Traditional artists all over America are in her debt.
 
In addition to her professional success,  she has earned the
 
admiration and affection of her colleagues  in the field,  and I
 
know that her friends are many here.
 Bess has been a steadfast
 
presence around this place for 15 years,  and her dedication to
 
the traditional arts she loves symbolizes the spirit that moves
 
us all in our service to the public and the arts.
 We will miss
 
her,  and I know that all of you will want to wish her a fond
 
farewell.
 
I am appointing Dan Sheehy,  long-time assistant director,  to the
 
position of Director of the Folk Arts Program.
 Dan has been with
 
the Endowment since 1978,  and he has served as Assistant Director
 
of the Folk Arts Program for the past 10 years.
 Before coming
 
here,  he worked with the Smithsonian Institution,  and over the
 
years,  he has  remained active both as a performer and as
 
presenter at the annual Festival of American Folklife.
 He brings
 
to the position a background as a musician,  teacher,  and training
 
as an ethnomusicologist.
 With his understanding and appreciation
 
of the traditional arts and his wide range of experience,  Dan is
 
the logical choice for the position,  and I know that you will
 
want to pass along your congratulations to him.
 I am always
 
pleased when I am able to select someone who has  risen through
 
the ranks as Director for a program.
 
Bess  approves,  too.

Chairman
 
As many of you may already know,  Bess Hawes will soon retire
 
after 15 years as head of the Folk Arts Program.
 Her commitment
 
and passion for the traditional arts have been evident from her
 
first days here,  and she has  served the agency and the field with'
 
distinction.
 She leaves  in place a vital support network,
 
particularly with the state arts  agency folk art apprenticeships,
 
and the highly respected and much cherished National Heritage
 
Awards.
 Traditional  artists  all over America are in her debt.
 
In addition to her professional success,  she has earned the
 
admiration and affection of her colleagues  in the field,  and I
 
know that her friends are many here.
 BeSs has been a steadfast
 
presence around this place for 15 years,  and her dedication to
 
the traditional arts she loves symbolizes the spirit that moves
 
us all  in our service to the public and the arts.
 We will miss
 
her,  and I know that  all of you will want to wish her a fond
 
I am appointing Dan Sheehy,  long-time assistant director,  to the
 
position of Director of the Folk Arts Program.

• Bess Hawes, a r
esident of Tower
 
Villas s
ince 1
976, r
ecently r
etired
 
after 15 years as director of the
 
Folk Arts Program of the National
 
Endowment for the Arts.  Following is
 
an edited version of the story by
 
Eric Brace that appeared in the Style
 
Section of The Washington Post on
 
F
eb. 1
6, 1992, commemorating her ac-
complishments in the folk art f
ield.
 
+  Bess Lomax Hawes has spent prac-
t
ically her whole l
ife immersed in
 
folk lore -
 music and dancing, s
ing-
ing and stories, costumes and carv-
ings.  She was born into the r
ight
 
f
amily in the f
irst place.  Her fath-
er was folk song collector, John
 
Lomax, who taught his children to ap-
preciate the works of ordinary
 
people.  "
Father focused on the
 
authentic," says her brother, Alan.
 
"Authenticity was the focus for all
 
of us."
 
+  Bess r
ecalls her childhood years
 
in Dallas as a "
romantic" family
 
l
ife.  "We'd go on picnics, eat fried
 
chicken and watermellon, swim in the
 
springs, and then s
ing all the way
 
home.  We were always s
inging.
 
Mother sang beautifully, but father
 
was just a good s
inger."
 
+  Her mother taught her the songs
 
of her family from Virginia and the
 
Carolinas, and by helping her father
 
and brother with their 1
938 book,
 
"Our S
inging Country," Bess' enthusi-
asm grew.  After graduating from Bryn
 
Mawr, she went to work in the music
 
division of the New York Public L
ib-
rary.  Here, she was in contact with
 
Pete Seeger, who had also worked on
 
"Our Singing Country," and who was
 
then spearheading a folk r
evival in
 
New York.

+
 "
I was asked to join the Almanac
 
S
ingers full t
ime," Bess said.
 
"
Others in the group included Pete
 
Seeger, Lee Hayes, Pete Hawes,
 
Millard Lainpell, Woodie Guthrie, and
 
i
t was then I met my husband Butch,
 
Pete Hawes' brother, who was s
inging
 
with us then.  We would have s
inging
 
parties or hootennanjes on Sunday
 
afternoons.  Leadbelly would come
 
occasionally; Burl Ives would come;
 
Josh White would come; but they
 
didn't perform with us on a r
egular
 
basis -
 they had bigger f
ish to
 
f
ry."
 
+  She and her husband moved to
 
California where three children were
 
born.  In s
inging to them, Bess found
 
her r
eal calling -
 teaching people
 
to s
ing and play the guitar.  "
I
 
began playing guitar and s
inging in
 
nurseries which gradually evolved
 
into more teaching.  i knew a lot of
 
good songs and I could get people to
 
s
ing, so they came to my c
lasses and
 
we'd have a wonderful t
ime all even-
ing.  That was about the s
ize of it."
 
+  But the scope of her teaching
 
was somewhat larger, her brother Alan
 
says.  "
She taught the whole state of
 
California to s
ing and play guitar.
 
She developed a way to teach 7
0 or 80
 
people at a t
ime."
 
+  Bess and her s
ister, Shirley
 
Duggan, often travelled together.
 
Once, while visiting an i
sland off
 
Panama, they were g
iven a traditional
 
welcome, the ladies all l
ined up to
 
s
ing their song of greeting, and Bess
 
s
at down and wrote out the music as
 
they were s
inging.
 
+  Bess' daughter, Naomi Bishop,
 
says people still come to her, all
 
MAR/APR 1992
 
these years later, saying, "You're
 
Bess Hawes' daughter?  She taught me
 
how to play guitar," or "
She taught
 
me how to s
ing."  But Naomi r
ecalls
 
that she herself went through periods
 
of absolute mortification that she
 
had a mother who played the banjo.
 
The guitar was f
ine, so was the
 
mandolin, but the banjo?  No one's
 
mother played the banjo!"
 
+
 "Our l
ife didn't seem extraordi-
nary," says son Nick Hawes.  "There
 
was nothing to which we could compare
 
it.  People ask me how I know so many
 
songs; I know songs the way k
ids
 
today know what happens to Bert and
 
Ernie on '
Sesame Street.'  It's what
 
we did all the t
ime -
 sat around
 
s
inging and telling stories."
 
+  After the death of her husband
 
in 1971, Bess spent more t
ime teach-
ing folklore and folklife at Califor-
nia State University, Northridge.  At
 
the invitation of Ralph Rinzler, then
 
director of the Smithsonian's Office
 
of Folklife Programs, she came to
 
Washington to work on the folklife
 
feativals of 1975 and 1976.
 
+  Bess then accepted an offer from
 
the National Endowment for the Arts
 
to develop its Folk Arts Program.  "
I
 
thought it might be interesting to
 
see what could be done if you had any
 
money to work with,"  she says,
 
"because we never had any money in

+  Bess is proud of the programs
 
she developed -
 the folk arts
 
network between the states and the
 
federal government, the apprentice-
ship programs bringing together
 
artistic masters and those who wanted
 
to learn, and the National Heritage
 
Fellowships, which have been r
eceived
 
by nearly 150 r
ecipients s
ince 1982.

I feel mildly defensive of the

I think you

the people's money."

 THE VOICE
 
+  "
Bess is a heroine," says Joe
 
Wilson, director of the National
 
Council of the Traditional Arts.
 
"
She brought a vision to the f
ield of
 
folk art that it needed."  "
It's
 
government at its best," says her old
 
f
riend Pete Seeger.  "
People just
 
don't comprehend that so many art
 
forms are r
eally here and r
eally
 
alive and part of our fabric," says
 
Dan Sheehy, her longtime assistant
 
and successor.  "
What Bess has done
 
is to hold them up for national
 
attention."
 
+  Bess herself explains folk art
 
as an identifier, as a public state-
ment of what a hell of a f
ine thing
 
it is to be a L
ithuanian or a Greek
 
or a Comanche Indian."
 
+  As she leaves the Folk Arts
 
Program in the hands of those she has
 
taught and inspired, she says there's
 
still so much out there that needs to
 
be brought to l
ight -
 new traditions
 
in voice, music, dance, costumes,
 
carving, "but I think this office is
 
in good shape -
 otherwise I
 wouldn't
 
be leaving.  But they won't be r
id of
 
me.  I
'll probably f
ind myself doing
 
pretty much what I
'm doing now, in
 
one form or another."
 
+
 I
t was r
ecalled that early in
 
the interview Bess had pointed out on
 
a large map of the United States how
 
folk art of all k
inds had progressed.
 
F
irst, a f
ew programs down through
 
Appalachia and a couple of things out
 
West.  But then she pointed to pins
 
and f
lags from Florida to Alaska and
 
Hawaii, and waved an arm to somewhere
 
off the map, where the farthest
 
corner of the Pacific might be.  "We
 
still don't have the Marianas," she
 
says, "but we will."
 
• Of that we're sure!  Happy Retire-
ment, Bess.

St. Patrick's Day at Tower Villas
 
• Even though the beer wasn't green,
 
the Tower Villas' St. Patrick's Day
 
party was a great success.  In addi-
t
ion to the beer, the bill of fare
 
included pretzels, cookies (
some were
 
green) and Irish coffee, made with
 
Irish whiskey, of course.  About 70
 
r
esidents attended and a big bash was
 
had by all.  Thanks to John McDonald,
 
at least one r
eveler was heard to pro-
c
laim the Irish coffee "
the best I
 
ever tasted."

• The organizational meeting was held on mar. 5 to draw up sub-committees, in-
cluding sub-group assignments, and to r
eview the work program for the past and
 
coming year.  Sue Durham (
1610) will again serve as Chair.
 
• The committee now has three sub-committees:  Grounds, chaired by Mary Lou
 
Durham (
906); Security, chaired by Martha Wilson (
1014) and Recycling, chaired
 
by Connie Collins (
408).  There will be two ad hoc committees -
 one dealing
 
with r
edecorating the main lobby and residents' elevator lobbies, chaired by
 
Martha Wilson; the other dealing with r
efurbishing the elevator interiors,
 
chaired by Paul Burbage (
213).
 
• The work r
elated to r
edecorating the lobbies is well under way; in fact, the
 
ad hoc committee is now at the stage where bids are being reviewed.  As the work
 
gets nearer to completion, r
esidents will be kept advised of decisions, e
ither
 
through the VOICE or by notices in boxes at the desk.  Work on refurbishing the
 
elevators i
s just beginning, but it will cover such aspects as compliance with
 
the current code, disability, legislation, etc.

ENGINEMUING co mITTEE
 
Worst Case Scenario
 
It's a dark and stormy
 
night.  L
ightening hits
 
Tower Villas r
epeatedly.
 
F
ire starts on the 1
7th
 
f
loor.  F
ire engines arrive.
 
The f
ire chief asks how many
 
people need to be helped on
 
17.  Our answer -
 WE DON'T
 
KNOW.  OUR DEMOGRAPHIC
 
SURVEY IS INCOMPLETE I
 I
!
 
• The Tower Villas convounity in
 
which we l
ive i
s equivalent to a
 
small village.  It's about the s
ize
 
of Chevy Chase, Maryland, where I
 
used to l
ive, which then had about
 
250 f
amilies spread out horizontally,
 
while Tower Villas has 252 units
 
stacked vertically.  We don't usually
 
think of ourselves as a village -
 we
 
l
ive in Arlington, but we also l
ive
 
in the community of Tower Villas.  We
 
govern ourselves in many r
espects,
 
but we need more Cof
linunity-minded-
ness.  We have a multi-million dollar
 
budget and an even greater equity in
 
where we l
ive -
 an equity we must be
 
alert to protect.
 
•
. We are governed by a duly elected
 
Board of Directors from among our-
s
elves, which is aided by other vol-
unteers serving on various committees
 
and subcommittees.  In order to oper-
ate Tower Villas for the benefit of
 
all, your Board needs to know who
 
forms this community and a f
ew basic
 
facts about each person who l
ives
 
here.  Thus, every few years we need
 
to take a "
census."  The last such
 
demographic survey was taken in 1980.
 
• In January we distributed new
 
demographic forms and hoped to have
 
the r
esults to you in this i
ssue of
 
the VOICE, but a considerable number
 
of r
esidents are r
eluctant to r
es-
pond.  The Board thought it obvious
 
as to the "
need to know" some basic
 
facts about our population.  The
 
above l
ightening/fire scenario i
l-
lustrates but one.  Here's another:
 
The wading pool plumbing
 
needs f
ixing.  How many
 
potential waders l
ive in
 
Tower Villas?  Is it econo-
mic for all with r
espect to
 
the whole budget to spend
 
$100, $1000, $5000 on this
 
amenity?  Or should we r
e-
place the wading pool with a
 
Jacuzzi, which might be used
 
by more r
esidents?
 
• The Board, which r
epresents you,
 
needs the basic facts from the survey
 
forms to make r
easoned judgments on
 
the budget and the maintenance and
 
upkeep of Tower Villas.  Almost 100
 
(
!) units have not returned the front
 
desk emergency forms, and 140 (
!)
 
have failed to r
espond to the talent
 
search inquiries.  The rate of r
eturn
 
for the yellow confidential form is
 
also poor, with 140 outstanding.
 
• With this non-participation r
ate
 
-
 approximately 40% -
 the r
esults
 
thus far received, if published,
 
would be highly speculative -
 we
 
cannot reasonably extrapolate for 4
0%
 
of the potential data!  To those who
 
have r
esponded, many thanks for your
 
c
ivic mindedness in doing so.  For
 
those who have not, for whatever
 
reason, please r
ethink your position;
 
it's in your best interest.  We would
 
like to give the results of the
 
census in the next issue of the
 
VOICE.

Know Your Building and It's People
 
• Your Engineering Committee is
 
again in operation and expects to
 
continue to help with Tower Villas
 
problems.  We have picked up an
 
additional new member -
 Joe Orth,
 
villa 1505 -
 and some high-powered
 
advisors, so we are looking forward
 
to another successful year.
 
• As you know, the Tower Villas
 
community in which we l
ive i
s equiva-
l
ent to a small village and as such
 
has much the same facilities and in-
f
rastructure problems.  A tour of the
 
building will r
eveal that in the gar-
age area we have a pump r
oom, which
 
s
erves as our water works; an elec-
t
rical room, which serves as our pow-
er station, where we have a sub-
station with transformers and switch-
ing gear, and an electrical distribu-
t
ion system.
 
• We also have a telephone exchange
 
r
oom, our own f
ire alarm system and
 
t
rash compactor, and on the 1
9th,
 
f
loor, boiler room and a
ir condition-
ing equipment that provides the heat-
ing, cooling, hot water, air distri-
bution and environment control for
 
year-round comfort, or discomfort.
 
• Last but not least, we have a
 
t
ransportation system, "
vertical" to
 
be sure; road ways, public square and
 
grounds.
 
• This, at an estimated r
eplacement
 
value of some $40,000,000, is a s
ize-
able investment.  It presents all of
 
us, including staff and contractors,
 
with a formidable challenge to main-
thin and keep it r
unning at a level
 
of which we can be proud.
 
• So learn as much as you can about
 
i
t's operation so you can do your
 
part to make it better, and we pledge
 
to continue to help where we can and
 
to answer your questions, if any.

FIFTY SIMPLE THINGS
 
Stamp Out Styrofoam
 
• Styrofoam is a polystyrene foam
 
made from benzene (
a known carcino-
gen), converted to styrene and in-
jected with gases that make it a foam
 
product.  The gases used are CFCs
 
which "
eat" ozone molecules and fur-
ther deplete our essential ozone
 
layer.  The alternatives to CFCs
 
aren't much improvement.  One is
 
HCFC, 95% less damaging, but still a
 
threat to the ozone layer.  Others
 
are pentane and butane which contri-
bute to urban smog.
 
• Polystyrene foam is completely
 
nonbiodegradeable; it just won't go
 
away!  F
ive hundred years from now
 
that foam cup from which you drank
 
your coffee this morning will still
 
be somewhere here on earth.
 
• Because of its structure -
 
containing so much air -
 all styr o --
 
foam takes up far too much space for
 
its weight, i
.e., enormous amounts of
 
precious space at already overflowing
 
landfills.  Polystyrene foam is dead-
ly to marine l
ife.  It f
loats on
 
ocean surfaces, breaks up into pel-
lets r
esembling food to sea animals.
 
For instance, when sea turtles eat
 
styrofoam, styrofoam's buoyancy keeps
 
them from diving, clogs their systems
 
and they starve.
 
• SIMPLE THINGS TO DO:  S
ince there
 
is no such thing as safe polystrene,
 
just don't use it. Avoid egg cartons
 
and picnic supplies made of it.  Pic-
nic with paper plates and cups and
 
ask for them at fast food
 
restaurants.

ERARy
 
Mike Harris
 
• I
 would l
ike to share with the
 
folks in Tower Villas, particularly
 
the many opera buffs l
iving here, an
 
experience i had r
ecently as a member
 
of the Washington Opera Company.
 
• Ever s
ince I heard Enrico Caruso
 
s
ing "Vesti la Giubba," I f
antasized
 
that one day I
 would perform in an
 
opera.  Seventy years later I had my
 
opportunity.  I auditioned for
 
"
Cavalleri Rusticana" and "
Pagliacci,"
 
two of E
.C.'s favorite operas, and
 
after my r
endition (
from the Latin, to
 
penetrate and disturb), the music
 
director took me aside and quietly,
 
but f
irmly, warned me that if ever I
 
sang one note of music within one mile
 
of the front entrance of the Kennedy
 
Center, he would have me f
logged.  I
 
accepted that, being a music lover
 
myself.
 
• He said, however, that he needed
 
some peasant types and he f
elt I could
 
f
ill the bill.  (
Debbie concurred,
 
which I took as a shot.)  So I became
 
a supernumerary.
 
• Supernumeraries, commonly known as
 
"
supers" or "
extras," are l
ifetime
 
members of the "Theater of the
 
Unheard."  Supers are not permitted to
 
speak or s
ing.  They may, on occasion,
 
mumble, or growl and look f
ierce, but
 
their primary function is to f
ill the
 
empty spaces on stage, wear weird
 
costumes and carry spears, or in
 
Italian operas, bottles of Chianti.
 
• Supers have no idea of what is
 
going on in center stage when the
 
opera is sung in a foreign tongue.
 
But by watching the principals, they
 
sense the mood of the scene and r
es-
pond accordingly with oohs and aahs or
 
glazed looks.  Some supers try to up-
stage other supers by s
creaming too
 
loudly or shoving people aside during
 
a mob scene, but these ego pushers are
 
Page 9
 
held in low esteem by the more d
iscip-
l
ined, who roundly condemn
 - 
behavior.  Supers have pridE
 
• We were twenty -
 mostly p
Lotes
 
s
ional or retired r
esidents of the
 
Washington area, who love opera and
 
are willing to endure eight r
ehear-
sals, eight performances, exiguous
 
pay, and gooey makeup to prove it.
 
During the performances we stood in
 
the wings l
istening to the principals,
 
enjoying every note.  The children's
 
chorus was incredible, never missing a
 
cue and s
inging like angels.  But
 
off-stage they acted l
ike normal kids,
 
i
. e
., 
 rough-housing a bit in the
 
dressing room.  Some old guy (
I'm not
 
saying who) turned them in to the
 
stage mothers and one father, the
 
latter saying, "
Is that all?"
 
• All in all we supers were treated
 
by the principals, the music director,
 
and the stage director, as if we be-
longed.  Not so the stagehands.  They
 
called us "
stupid-numeraries "  We
 
seemed to be always getting in their
 
way and asking stupid questions, l
ike
 
"How come Pagliacci enters in a Model
 
T Ford?"  "Yes," they answered, "we
 
know he should enter in a mule cart
 
but a Model T is more predictable "
 
In retrospect, it was a stupid
 
question.
 
,
 
• Highlights?  The curtain calls,
 
gray-haired men and women standing,
 
clapping and bravoing l
ike mad.  They,
 
too, must have heard E
.C. s
ing.  (
E.C.
 
rates a standup.)
 
• We are fortunate to have a world
 
c
lass opera company nearby.  Next year
 
the house will resonate with the
 
glorious sounds of "Othello,"
 
"Turandot," and the "Tsar's Bride,"
 
among others.  Will we try it again?
 
Maybe.  Playing it dumb turned out to
 
be a lot of fun.

riend with a warm handshake and
 
exchanging a f
ew cordial words.
 
Before the church services began Mike
 
helped to bring into the church a
 
guilded f
igurine born on a palanquin.
 
• The last we saw of him he was
 
assisting a l
ittle old lady on her
 
way home after church, solicitously
 
shielding her f
rom the mid-day sun
 
with an umbrella.  Bravos rang
 
throughout the hall.

• The two new arrivals who moved into
 
210 are Erin and Martin Lenki, twin
 
babies of Doctors Shaun and Renee
 
Lenki.  They moved in on Feb. 1
,
 
shortly after their birth on Jan. 3
1.
 
They were greeted with a kiss by Big
 
Brother Robert and Big S
ister Molly,
 
and a welcoming committee of Tower
 
Villas r
esidents at the Front Desk
 
when Daddy Shaun brought them to their
 
new home.
 
• Erin, the f
irst born, weighed 6 lbs
 
2 oz.  Martin arrived a l
ittle later
 
weighing 6 lbs 13 oz.  Both babies are
 
healthy and thriving.
 
• We wish them a fun-filled l
ife at
 
Tower Villas and congratulations to
 
Rene and Shaun.

TIP Wf
l IS IMPORTANT
 
• A two-week vacation in San Diego
 
at the end of January would be great,
 
I thought -
 an escape f
rom snow and
 
s
lush in Arlington.  But a vacation
 
in Southern California the middle of
 
February would have been even better
 
considering the snow of February 13.
 
• San Diego's Zoo is one of the
 
world's largest and best.  And Sea
 
World with performing killer whales,
 
dolphins, sea l
ions, and a water ski
 
show i
s touted as a "must."  But I
 
passed them by; too many other places
 
and things were more appealing to me
 
-
 the Old Town State Historical
 
Park, Seaport Village, the Wild
 
Animal Park in Escondido that is
 
viewed f
rom a 5
0-minute narrated
 
monorail r
ide, the 19th Century ele-
gance of the f
amous Hotel Del Coro-
nado, the Mission San Diego de Al-
cala, the bright r
ed trolly f
rom
 
Center City to the San Ysidro border
 
crossing to Tijuana to name a few.
 
• I
'm a history buff, so the early
 
history of the area I found most
 
fascinating.  I sat at an antique
 
desk in the Mason Street School
 
erected in 1865, the f
irst public
 
school serving all of San Diego
 
County -
 an area 1
4,800 square
 
miles, larger than Massachusetts,
 
Connecticut, and Rhode Island com-
bined.  In those days school was in
 
s
ession all year long, had an average
 
attendance of 35 students —from 4 to
 
1
7 years old —and all e
ight grades
 
were taught in the one small room.
 
-
 Discipline involved specific
 
punishments for l
isted infractions,
 
e
.g., coming to school with dirty
 
faces and hands or wearing long
 
f
inger nails -
 2 lashes; scuffling
 
-
 4 lashes; drinking spiritous
 
l
iquors at school -
 8 lashes, and
 
playing cards at school -
 10 lashes.
 
r
ented two rooms for $2 a month, but
 
wrote that f
leas were plentiful and
 
hungry.  After 11 months, she r
esign-
ed and married the school board
 
president.
 
• San Diego in the last half of the
 
19th Century was colorful, to say the
 
least -
 a honeycomb of saloons, tat-
too parlors, bordellos, gambling
 
halls, grog shops, boarding houses,
 
low-life music halls called melo-
deons, and fancy "parlor houses."  It
 
was populated by droves of footpads,
 
strumpets, card sharps, saloonmen,
 
and r
eal estate speculators.  One
 
madam sent her harlots into the
 
streets to drum up business.  A
 
painted lady in a pink gown would
 
sashay down the street with sugges-
t
ive wiggles and glances.  When a man
 
trailed her, she returned to her room
 
to await developments.  When the man
 
ente red the building, the madam met
 
him and the conversation went some-
thing l
ike this:  "What is her name,
 
s
ir?"  "Well, I don't r
ightly know."
 
"What is her room number?"  Well, I
 
don't know that either."  "Then, what
 
was she wearing?"  "Oh, I know that.
 
Pink!"  "Take the stairs to the third
 
floor and go to the pink room."
 
• Balboa Park is huge, housing many
 
attractions in buildings of Spanish
 
Colonial architecture erected for the
 
1915 celebration of the completion of
 
the Panama Canal and the 1935 Cali-
fornia-Pacific Exposition.  I visited
 
three of the Park's nine museums, in-
cluding the 76-foot domed Omnimax
 
Theater for the thrilling "
experi-
ence" of shooting the r
apids in the
 
Grand Canyon's Colorado River.
 
• But the r
est of Balboa Park and
 
San Diego will be on my agenda when,
 
if all goes well, I spend another two
 
weeks there next year -
 hopefully
 
with better t
iming to avoid Febru-
ary's wintry weather here.

se every moment well!
 I a
lready found
 
out to my r
eal surprise t
hat I have apparently shrunk t
wo entire i
nches s
ince
 
I
 was here l
ast two years ago.  At t
hat r
ate,  I
'll be a m
idget at t
he age of 90!
 
Anyway, they told me to keep c
alm, t
hat t
hey w
ill measure me after weeks of
 
s
tretching and posture exercises and see i
f I haven't grown an i
nch or so.
 
mean,  I knew you shrunk s
lightly a
s you mature, but t
his i
s r
idiculous!
 
I spoke t
o Naomi  today a
nd f
ound out t
hat Amanda's b
irthday, which occured l
ast
 
week had been especially gala.
 N a
nd I had p
lanned jointly to g
ive Amanda a
nother
 
of t
hose American g
irl dolls who are extremely expensive but who ce
xe
zx
 
r
e extremely well made and come equipped w

nteresting accc'trements

i
ncluding n
ightgowns and school satchels appropriate t
o t

nd t
heir own
  
dolls.
 Amanda a
lready had one (
Samantha) but had been admiring another i

c
atalogue (

So  u- t
j
 t
he order
 ki
 went i
n l
ate and  Naomi and I
 were worried because Amanda
 
wanted t
o have her b
irthday at breakfast, s
ince she was going to day camp and would
 
get home l
ate a
nd only just i
n t
ime t
o go t
o a concert f
or t
he evening (
her party).
 
So Naomi f
inally t
yped a note out and sealed i
t and put i
t i
nto t
he mail a day or
 
t
wo a
head saying "Dear Amanda,  I
 w
ill be coming t
o see you on your b
irthday,  I
 
hope, bringing you some presents, but i
t i

iss t

 S
igned A Friend''
 
Well a

s

Cowboy Poetry and Song:  Collecting and Recollecting (
4)
 
When I first accepted the kind invitation of the
 
University of Colorado to come here and make this talk,  I
 
thought it would be a bit of a lark.  In my father's day,  he
 
had lectured about cowboy poetry and songs all through the
 
western states.  I thought it might be fun,  and also  a
 
challenge,  to review for myself what he had done and how he
 
had managed it all that long time ago.  I could maybe make my
 
talk a bit of a testimony to my cantankerous,  complicated,
 
and ever courageous father,  I thought,  and maybe also speak a
 
bit about what has happened since his day and time.
 
But what I had forgotten was just how long ago his day
 
and time was.  In preparing my talk I found myself needing to
 
explain to present-day listeners the situation of people who
 
I never knew directly myself because they were even before
 
me.  So here I am sitting squarely between two separated
 
generations,  armed,  really,  with nothing but a few stories
 
things I
' ve heard second-hand.
 
But  I guess that is the classic folklorist's position.
 
We collect and we re-collect  (recollect?),  people tell us
 
things,  we tell them back -
 we' ve even made up a nine-dollar
 
name for the process -
-
 "oral transmission",  we call it.  This
 
phrase stands for the principal ways through which
 
traditional ideas and materials survive and spread out like
 
some cosmic game of "Gossip" over vast quantities of space
 
and time without ever having to be formally validated or
 
approved of by any institution.  Let's think about that for a
 
minute;  it's important to realize how strong and how totally
 
unstoppable a process it is.
 
Probably everybody in this room,  if I asked you what do
 
you say when you see the first star come out at night,  would
 
have the same response.  But who taught it to you? How did you
 
learn it? Why do you remember it over all these years when
 
2
 
you really don't say it very often? Could you forget it if
 
you tried? Think how many things you would rather know than
 
Starlight starbright.  But there it is irrevocably stuck in
 
your brain,  and taking up valuable room too.  And you learned
 
it through oral transmission -
 somebody said it to you and
 
you remembered it;  your brain caught hold of it,  probably at
 
first hearing,  and refused to let it go.
 
When I was teaching,  one of my students wrote on a quiz:
 
"Oral transmission is a process of mouth to ear
 
resuscitation" and I gave him an A,  because he had captured
 
the vitality of the whole transaction.  You see,  if I am lucky
 
enough tonight to articulate just one or two ideas or phrases
 
that stay with you past the moment,  it will be because you
  
have injected the vigor of the contents of your own head into
 
my remarks,  and bits of the two have sort of stuck together.
 
What we learn,  especially about the past,  is not pale and
 
passive;  it is full of red blood and excitement and meaning
 
and that is why it stays alive in our memories.  But we must
 
summons our energies to meet it so as to remember it,  so as
 
to let these connections take place,  illuminating the present
 
as well as the long ago.
 
I am 73 years old.  I was born in 1921 when my father was
 
54.  By the time I got to know him,  he was more like a
 
grandfather to me.  He was born in 1867 -
-
 one and a quarter
 
centuries ago.
 
American history is really so short.  I remember once at
 
the Library of Congress listening to a 1940 field recording
 
of an old Virginia gentleman singing "The Ram of Derby",  an
 
ancient lying
 
verse telling
 
old gentleman
 
jokey ballad about an enormous sheep,  each
 
a bigger whopper than the one before.  And the
 
singing it stopped and laughed and said "You
 
know,  my grand-daddy always used to say that George
 
Washington helt him on his knee and sung him that old song
 
when he was  just a little un." And I thought to myself,
 
"Well,  you old liar," but  later I realized,  counting back,  it
 
3
 
was  just possible
 within the four generations,  counting
 
mine.
 
And then,  whether he decorated things up or not,  that
 
old gentleman was certainly a better rememberer than I am;
 
indeed, most country folks are.  For me,  the past isn't a step
 
by step progression,  it's a series of pictures,  kind of
 
lightning flashes,  generally out of order but almost always
 
accompanied by the stormy feelings of the child I was.  And
 
that's kind of a western metaphor I hit on there,  isn't it?
 
Westerners,  you know,  like all people who are outdoors a lot,
 
care about the weather and think about it and use it in their
 
everyday language. My father often used to end his cowboy
 
song lectures ctures with a isolated verse whose origin I
 
don't know but  I can still hear his voice saying it:
 
I
' ve been where the lightning,  the lightning
 
Tangled in my eyes;
 
The cattle I could scarcely hold;
 
I think I heard my boss-man say,
 
"I want all brave-hearted men
 
Who ain't afraid to die
 
To whoop the cattle from morning till night
 
Way up on the Kansas line."
 
Oh boy,  that was the stuff to feed the troops.  I remember
 
roars of applause from his young college audiences of the 20s
 
and 30s,
 as I sat there in the dark,  thrilled to be let stay
 
up beyond my bedtime with the grown-ups.  And I remember
 
Leadbelly singing out on our side porch in Austin:
 
When I was a cowboy out on the western plains
 
When I was a cowboy out on the western plains
 
I could rope a streak of lightning
 
And ride a shower of rain.
 
Come a cow cow yicky,
 
Come a cow cow yicky yicky yay.
 
Lots of black singers in Texas in those days  sang cowboy
 
songs;  lots of black Texans worked on ranches.  And,  by the
 
way,  I just sang that verse to you myself to try to begin to
 
give you the feeling that  lots of people actually used to
 
4
 
rear back and sing and many still do,  requiring neither a
 
trained voice,an inStrument,a stage,  a silent audience,  nor
 
an electrical outlet to plug into.
 
Well,  I
' m already getting ahead of things.  Let me start
 
again -
 back with my father,  John A.  Lomax.  He was born,  the
 
last of seven children,  in the Black River country of west
 
central Mississippi in 1867,  a century and a quarter ago.
 
When he was two years old,  his family loaded all their
 
possessions into two wagons,  one pulled by two mules named
 
Jack and Fan,  and the other by two oxen named Bright and
 
Berry,  and they all started out on the five hundred mile
 
trail for east Texas.  They bought timbered land there on the
 
edge of the Bosque River,  near a spot which was to be a
 
fording place on one of the south-eastern branches of the
 
Chisholm Trail.  And they built a two-room log cabin and
 
settled in to raise children and wheat,  corn and chickens,
 
long-horned cows,  cotton,  and horses.
 
In my father's autobiography,  "Adventures of a Ballad
 
Hunter" -
-
 which I recommend to you,  by the way,  it's really
 
a wonderful book -
-
 he described waking up in the night as a
 
little boy and hearing cowpunchers,  camped for the night down
 
by the Bosque River,  joking and singing and telling stories.
 
And I think I remember him telling me how he would sneak out
 
of the house sometimes and creep through the bushes in the
 
dark night until he could get closer and hear them better,
 
but  I can't find that  in his writingsnow,  so maybe I made it
 
up.  But  I do know that at that time he did a really
 
remarkable thing:  he began,  when he was just a little boy,  to
 
write down the words of the songs he heard the men singing so
 
that he wouldn't forget them. We'll come back to that later.
 
He loved to tell stories about his life in Bosque County
 
and he told them well,  but what he used to tell about with
 
the greatest affection,  it seems to me now,  were the
 
tournaments that were then the high point of any local
 
celebration,  bringing together people ordinarily scattered
 
all across Bosque County.
 
L
 
5
 
Tournaments were Texas re-creations of an ante-bellum
 
southern custom in which mounted riders carrying six foot
 
lances would thunder down a two hundred yard track,  each
 
trying to spear all twelve of the small brass rings that hung
 
from poles along the way,  Each rider wore the be-ribboned
 
favor of a local young lady;  each one had curvetted his horse
 
in special tricks before the crowd as his name was called by
 
the master of ceremonies -
-
George Scrutchfield,  The Knight of the Golden Spur
 
Johnny Rundell,  The Knight of the Lost Cause
 
Ed McCurry,  The Knight of the Morning Star
 
Bob Hanna,  The Knight of the Slim Chance
 
The winner,  father said,  crowned his lady love before all the
 
spectators and then together they would
 
started afterwards on the platform back
 
Now,  though father clearly had had
 
ladies,  it was the horsemanship and the
 
riders he talked about most. And it was
 
became so taken with those hard-bitten,
 
lead the dance that
 
of the judges'  stand.
 
an eye for the fair
 
skill of the young
 
possibly then that he
 
skillful,  rowdy,
 
adventurous,  to him really romantic young men,  many of them
 
vanishing up the long trail that he was too young and too
 
burdened with responsibilities to then follow.
 
Now,  it's time to remind you a little bit about that
 
Chisholm Trail and the whole era of the cattle drives and why
 
they happened where they did and faded away when they did.  I
 
hope you won't be insulted.  I may have been living with
 
tenderfeet in the east too long but generally I find that
 
almost everybody needs to be reminded a bit about that hazy
 
and complex period over which Americans have fantasized for
 
so long.
 
Here is how my father,  writing in 1910,  began to
 
describe it:
 
From 1870 to 1890 one million mustang ponies
 
and twelve million head of longhorn cattle
 
were driven up the trails  from Texas to
 
market  in Kansas,  Wyoming,  Montana,  and other
 
a
 
6
 
western states.  The herds numbered usually
 
from one thousand to three thousand,  though at
 
times as many as five thousand cattle
 
made up a single trail herd.  Behind and around
 
and ahead of each bunch of cattle rode a group
 
of men,  mostly very young,  bold,  youthful
 
Vikings of the seas of sage grass through
 
which they pushed their way.  They came to be
 
known as cowboys -
-
 the boys who take care of
 
the cows  (from the Spanish "vaquero" and
 
"vaca".
 
Where did all these cows come from?
 J.  Frank Dobie,  in
 
his great book "The Longhorns" tells us that Columbus,  on his
 
second voyage in 1493,  landed cattle in Santo Domingo and in
 
the next years their offspring were shipped throughout the
 
developing Caribbean,  Cortez himself stocking a hacienda in
 
Cuba and importing cattle from it to his estate in Mexico,
 
which he had named Cuernavaca  (
Cow Horn) .
 In 1540,  the
 
explorer Coronado assembled more than 500 hundred head of
 
cattle,  as well as sheep and hogs,  and drove them along on
 
his great expedition north of the Rio Grande as feed for his
 
troops.  Fighting and breeding bulls were imported to the new
 
world from Spain and exhibited at local mission fiestas
 
throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.  Actually,  wherever
 
the Spanish went,  they took cattle and horses,  a good number
 
of which escaped or were left behind as too exhausted to
 
continue on the long marches throughout the southwest.
 
So,  since the Spanish,  like most colonials,  kept most of
 
their male animals uncastrated,  small populations of wild
 
cattle began to develop across the vast empty grasslands of
 
Texas and Louisiana,  and California as well,  In 1767 a French
 
traveller crossing Texas observed "horned cattle,  originally
 
tame,  that long since became wild and now roam in large herds
 
all over the plain,"  (
actually more accurately all over the
 
brushy country east of the Pecos) .
 They were  frequently
 
7
 
rounded up and sold for hides and tallow;  essentially they
 
were considered game animals.
 
But after the establishment of the Republic of Texas,
 
the ever-increasing colonization of the southwest by English
 
speakers brought with it an increase in large animal
 
ranching,  for newcomers could claim much more land if they
 
declared their intention was to ranch rather than to farm.
 
And Texas was,  according to many,  "the best stock country in
 
the world" with grass that was green almost the year round.
 
Cattle multiplied on the ranches and in the wild until local
 
prices dropped to less than five dollars an animal in the
 
mid-nineteenth century.  And at the same time exploding
 
population markets in the northeast following the Civil War
 
were offering ten times as much for a steer on the hoof.
 
The problem was clear for southwestern ranchers.  The
 
cattle had to be got north and at that time,  there was only
 
one way.  They had to walk.  As they had walked from Mexico up
 
to Texas  in the centuries before,  now they had to walk from
 
Texas to Kansas.  The Kansas Pacific railroad line which had
 
connections into Chicago  (
soon to become "Hog and Steer
 
Butcher for the world")  eventually chose to build cattle
 
shipping stations in Abilene Kansas and by 1880 five million
 
cattle had been shipped to market from Abilene and another
 
five million trailed north to stock the western ranges.
 
Texas,  cattlemen said,  had the best breeding grounds; but the
 
lush summer grasses of Montana,  Wyoming and Colorado were
 
more nutritious for fattening the growing animals.
 
It was all over before the turn of the century.  It only
 
lasted for about twenty years,  really,  from about 1870 to
 
1890 give or take a bit on either end.  As unclaimed lands
 
fell into new and profit-hungry hands,  ranges once open were
 
fenced;  trail routes were cut;  and newly built roads and
 
railroad lines made lengthy drives economically unprofitable.
 
The whole panorama -
-
 the great cattle drives like rivers of
 
living animals,  the fabled longhorn steers who "could walk to
 
Hell and back again",  the young knights of the Slim Chance
 
8
 
and the Golden Spurs,  the frontier towns where the money they
 
earned on the long trail vanished too soon -
-
 all faded away
 
or settled down or maybe just began to seem every day and
 
sometimes a bit grungy even.
 
But it made a great story,  one from which Americans
 
shoot,  from which the people of the entire world
 -
-
 are
 
still drawing excitement,  romance and vitality. And the
 
primary authors of that story -
-
 no matter how much it was
 
changed later -
-
 were the cowboys,  the vaqueros,  the expert
 
herders and animal husbandry men who my father described in
 
the romantic language of his day,  so common and so subtly
 
true,  as "bold youthful Vikings of the seas of sage grass".
 
My brother Alan,  writing from the perspective of 75 years
 
later,  saw the cowboys differently.  "These anonymous,  badly
 
paid hired hands,  who lived hard and usually died poor,
 
served as unpaid irregular cavalry in the long and cruel
 
struggle during which the United States snatched western
 
lands away from its Indians and Mexican inhabitants." When we
 
look back,  it is important,  I think,  to keep both of these
 
perspectives in mind.  And most of all to keep on listening to
 
the cowboys themselves:  their songs,  their recitations,  and
 
thankfully the several autobiographies some left behind. (
"We
 
Pointed Them North" by Teddy Blue(E.C.  Abbott)  is a great
 
one.)
 
I
'll sing you a song though it'll be a sad one
 
Of trials and troubles and where first begun
 
I left my dear parents,  my friends and my home
 
Across the wide mountains and valleys to roam.
 
I travelled out west and I joined a large train
 
Which carried me over valleys and rivers and plains
 
And often of an evening a-hunting we' d go
 
To shoot the fleet antelope and the wild buffalo.
 
That was the voice of Mr.  Alec Moore,  an ex-cowboy
 
and in his eighties when father recorded him in the early 40s
 
9
 
in Austin Texas,where he sold ice cream on a stick out of a
 
small ice chest fastened to the handlebars of his ancient
 
bicycle.  Kind of a come-down for an old cow-puncher but the
 
local children adored him.
 
Today whenever I read a book about that era -
-
 and
 
there's about a billion of them -
-
 it's rare to come across
 
an author who doesn't say something about "the romantic
 
stereotype of the cowboy",  "the west that never was",  "the
 
mythic past of the cattle drives" and things like that.  But I
 
grew up around my father,  who was indeed a romantic of
 
deepest dye -
-
 he used to read aloud to us every night:
 
Shakespeare and Alfred Lord Tennyson and Charles Dickens and
 
his  favorite poet,  Robert Browning -
-
 and his voice would
 
husk up at the sad parts.  And he wrote gushy old-timey love
 
letters to my mother and long after her death courted my
 
stepmother with roses and gallantry,  But he believed in
 
letting the cowboys speak for themselves.
 
Look at his books.  The poetry -
 with occasional music
 
notation added -
 stares stark and bare up from the pages of
 
his two earliest cowboy collections.  There's nothing to do
 
with those books but read the language as it was spoken and
 
as  father wrote it down.
 
I said earlier that he had begun to write down the songs
 
he heard the cowpunchers sing when he was just a little boy.
 
But what  I didn't say then was how almost unheard of such a
 
thing was.  Educated nineteenth century Americans were deeply
 
convinced that all real high culture was essentially European
 
-
-
 well,  Greece got in there a bit and maybe the Egyptians
 
were allowed to have done a few worthwhile things
 But the
 
only intellectual distinctions truly available to Americans
 
came through their absorption of old-world literature,
 
history and values,  most people believed.
 
Walt Whitman,  Emerson,  Melville,  Mark Twain all
 
thundered their defenses of the originality and creativity of
 
the new Americans,  but the new Americans often didn't really
 
believe in it themselves.  And I must remind you that the
 
10
 
inappropriate grant but the enormous number of Americans who
 
wonder in their heart of hearts why in tarnation do we go
 
spending public money on highbrow tom-foolery like we do?
 
It's an old American line of thought.
 
Now my father ran into this intellectual barricade
 
early.  At the age of 28,  he had finally saved enough money to
 
get to the University of Texas,  and he hit the ground
 
running,  as they say,  and managed to compress his A.B.  degree
 
into only two years.  But before he graduated,  he had taken
 
his collection of cowboy poetry to a scholar in the
 
University of Texas English Department.  As he wrote about the
 
episode later:
 
Timidly I handed Dr.  Callaway my roll of dingy
 
manuscript written out in lead pencil and tied
 
together with a cotton string.  Courteous and
 
kindly gentleman that he was,  he thanked me and
 
promised a report the next day.  Alas,  the follow-
ing morning,  Dr.  Callaway told me that my samples
 
of frontier literature were tawdry,  cheap,  and
 
unworthy.  I had better give my attention to the
 
great movements of writing that had come sounding
 
down the ages.  There was no possible connection,
 
he said,  between the tall tales of Texas and the
 
tall tales of Beowulf.  His decision,  exquisitely
 
considerate,  was final,  absolute.  No single crumb
 
of comfort was  left to me.  I was unwilling to have
 
anyone else see the examples of my folly or know of
 
my disappointment.  So that night in the dark,  out
 
behind Breckinridge Hall,  the men's dormitory where
 
I lodged,  I made a small bonfire of every scrap of
 
my cowboy songs.
 
For the time being he abandoned folklore and began
 
making his living as an English teacher at several Texas
 
universities. But he never stopped thinking about it and in
 
fact began learning songs again from his students,  many of
 
1
1
 
them country boys in those great days of the free land-grant
 
colleges.
 
Oh slow up dogies,  qwuit your roving around
 
You have wandered and trampled all over the ground
 
Oh,  graze along dogies and feel kinda slow
 
And don't be forever on the go.
 
Move slow,  little dogies,  move slow.
 
I have circle-hered,  trail-hered,  night-hered too
 
But to keep you together,  that's what I CAN'T DO,
 
My horse is leg=-weary and I
' m awful tired
 
But if I let you get away,  I
' m sure to get fired,
 
Bunch up,  little dogies,  bunch up.
 
Harry Stephens,  a student of my father's at Texas A & M
 
told father he had made that song up night-herding for the
 
Wylie Company in Yellowstone Park.  Father wrote later,  "One
 
day in the spring of 1909,  Harry leaned over the gate of my
 
home and called to me,  '
Professor,  I
' ve come to say good-bye'
 
Grass is a-rising,  and I
' ve got to move on.'" They
 
corresponded for some years,  but never met again.
 
Years later,  the legendary Harvard scholars
 Barrett
 
Wendell and George Lyman Kittredge encouraged him to start
 
over again and endorsed a proposal that he sent off to
 
newspapers across the western states looking for materials
 
that could be put into a "complete collection of the native
 
ballads and songs of the West".The last paragraph of his
 
appeal was characteristic:
 
May I add that the ballads and the like which,
 
because of crudity,  incompleteness,  coarseness,  or
 
for any other reason are unavailable for publica-
tion,  will be as interesting and as useful for my
 
purposes as others of more merit.  It is my desire
 
to collect the songs and ballads now or lately in
 
actual existence and in the precise form which they
 
have popularly assumed.
 
12
 
He believed very literally in the voice of the people
 
and if it was crude or rough it was all right with him.  Of
 
course,  at that time,  publishers wouldn't print all of it,
 
but he took lots of chances,  and in his very first book,
 
"Cowboy Songs",  published in 1910 with a preface by President
 
Theodore Roosevelt,  he ended his manuscript with a fleeting
 
stanza that had been recited to him by a rider on the Diamond
 
A ranch in New Mexico.
 
Oh the cow-puncher loves the whistle of his rope
 
As he races over the plains;
 
And the stage-driver loves the popping of his whip
 
And the rattle of his Concord chains.
 
And we'll all pray the Lord that we will be saved
 
And we'll keep the Golden Rule;
 
But I
' d ruther be at home with the girl I love
 
Than to monkey with this goddamned mule.
 
Now that was pretty daring for those days,  and it was
 
certainly far from the lush romantic language of many of the
 
other period songs and poems he collected and printed-- songs
 
like Home On the Range,  Lasca,  the Red River Valley.  Both
 
poetic styles,  the flowery and the plain-spoken
 -
-
represented for father the authentic voices of these
 
competent,  scantily-educated,  but widely-experienced men who
 
were changing the face of the west he loved.  All his life,  he
 
wanted to give them a bigger voice,  one that would carry
 
beyond the limits of simple "oral transmission"  (my mouth to
 
your ear),  that would give them the broad-scale audience that
 
he thought they deserved,  and that would also provide the
 
whole United States with a creative and passionate vernacular
 
poetry that everyone could not  just enjoy but feel proud of.
 
Father wanted people exposed to the real words,  even if
 
sentimental,  even if rough,  and the real voices,  even if
 
raucous.  And so,  when the RCA Victor Company began putting
 
out those marvellous new-fangled victrolas that could capture
 
sounds and transfer them to incised spiral lines on wax
 
cylinders,  father was one of the  first  4n line,  Armed with
 
13
 
some Harvard Seldon fellowship moneys,  he purchased one of
 
these magical machines,  all equipped with a big flaring horn
 
like the one you can still see the dog listening to on the
 
RCA logo.  By the way,  when you recorded on one of those
 
cylinder machines,  you had to put your face as far down in
 
the horn as you could get it so as to block out as much
 
ambient noise as possible,  and then start to sing.  It was
 
really uncomfortable and kind of unnatural,  and father ran
 
into quite a number of cowpunchers who simply refused to take
 
any part whatever in such a dubious enterprise.
 
Other collectors of course used them too and some of
 
those early cylinders have survived and are at the Folk
 
Archive at the Library of Congress and the Sound Archives at
 
the University of Indiana.  But it was such early times.
 
Nobody really knew what they were doing exactly.  Not long ago
 
my sister  (
 aged 89)  remarked to me,  "You know,  honey,  that
 
exhibit we went to see in Washington with those cylinders in
 
it,  it called to mind one time before you were born when we
 
used to have a big old wooden box out on the sleeping porch
 
back in Austin and I remember one day mother went to open it
 
up and it was  just a big puddle of melted black wax.  It was
 
awful hot that summer,  and of course we didn't know."  .But
 
some of the cyllinders stayed intact long enough for father
 
to play them for musicians who notated the tunes for him  (he
 
couldn't read music) .
 And when "Cowboy Songs" was published
 
in  1910 it was not only John A.  Lomax's first book,  it was
 
the first collection of native American folk songs ever
 
printed along with the music of the songs,  even though the
 
publishers would print the music of only eighteen of the
 
hundred or more tunes he had recorded.
 
What happened to the rest of them? Nobody really knows.
 
The cylinders are long since gone,  the papers have been
 
scattered.  And that might seem kind of careless,  but I should
 
remind you that few people during those early years did their
 
folkloring as a full time profession.  Father started out as
 
an unpaid amateur and when he got himself a wife and four
 
14
 
children to support,  in a desperate attempt to make some
 
genuine money,  he went into banking and did pretty well at it
 
too.  During my childhood he wasn't doing folklore,  he was
 
vice president of the Republic National Bank in Dallas,
 
The crash of 1929 almost destroyed him psychologically
 
and fiscally.  He left his  job and tried to recapture some of
 
his old triumphs,  undertaking lectures on college campuses
 
all over the country.  Already in his early sixties,  he
 
negotiated with the Rockefeller Foundation and the Library of
 
Congress and finally began his last major project -
 to record
 
now the traditional music of the entire south.  Overall he
 
produced six books,  several them in co-authorship with his
 
son Alan Lomax.
 
For folkloring in those days was pretty much of a family
 
affair.  Everybody had to help out
 With a healthy clamorous
 
family to raise,  and without institutional support of any
 
kind,  father became a warm man with a dollar.  I am sure that
 
every now and again he must have hired a secretary but I
 
don't recall seeing one. What I do recall is seeing him
 
forever at his desk,  writing letter after letter,  ten and
 
twenty a day,  in his beautiful Spencerian longhand with a dip
 
pen.  Most are long since gone;  nobody had time to copy them.
 
And I also recall sitting down at the old family
 
Remington typewriter whenever I came home from college and
 
starting in on the typing -
 almost always,  copies of the
 
texts of songs that father and Alan were working with.  There
 
was no xerox machine,  then,  only me,  and any other family
 
member or friend or the odd WPA worker who could be pressed
 
into the never-ending toil of copying,  one word at a time,
 
all the hundreds and hundreds of songs,  notes and
 
manuscripts,  each and every time you needed a copy.  People
 
ask me sometimes where a particular unusual verse in one of
 
father's songs came from and I have a pretty good notion:
 he
 
probably cut it with scissors out of another version somebody
 
else had sent him or that he had collected from another
 
16
 
picture show or heard their own songs coming back at them
 
over the radio.
 
Of course,  most of the old time cowpunchers had done
 
their own bits of improving reality in their songs and
 
stories.  But their songs joined the great stream of oral
 
transmission and were remembered and forgotten in bits and
 
pieces,  put back together again by the next singer,  and then
 
by another until they truly became the composition of the
 
many.  And I myself think that father was so used to this
 
process that he saw his own editing as  just another part of
 
it.  But there were other forces at work too.
 
Cowboy songs were work songs;  they came into being
 
because of the nature of the work to be done. And there are
 
,-
 t
, 4
-
 e
 r1 
two big kinds of songs associated with work __Athe kind that
 
are sung while the work is going on,  coordinating or
 
prolonging the effort.  Most people reserve the term,  work
 
songs,  for that group because the demands of the particular
 
task at hand completely control the song.  The song stops,  for
 
example,  right in the middle if and when the task is done;  no
 
one feels it has to be sung to its end,  assuming that it even
 
has one.
 
And then there are songs about work that are typically
 
sung after the job's all done and it's being thought about in
 
tranquility -
-
 songs that actually glorify the job by telling
 
exciting stories about an accident or a comic event maybe,
 
songs that show how tough and skillful the workers are.  These
 
are more formal poetic constructions;  some people call them
 
occupational ballads.  "The Streets of Laredo" about the dying
 
cowboy who once in the saddle used to go dashing,  once in the
 
saddle he used to go gay -
-
 that's a good one that you might
 
have heard.
 
But because of the nature of trail herding itself,  many
 
cowboy songs combined these two types.  As father always
 
carefully pointed out,  on the day to day level,  cattle
 
droving was a pretty boring proposition.  A trail drive wasn't
 
a race;  the whole idea was to get a lot of cows from one
 
17
 
place to another in as good physical condition as possible
 
because they were going to be weighed,  and you were going to
 
get paid off accordingly,  at the end of the trail,  not the
 
beginning.  So you moved "kinda slow" most of the time,
 
letting the cattle graze as they went.
 
So the long lonely tedious hours  in the saddle often
 
produced long,  lonely songs.  In fact one of the criteria for
 
a good cowboy song was simple length.  "The Old Chisholm
 
Trail:" was of course the hands-down champion in that
 
department.  An old-timer who had  just  sung my father 69
 
verses of that  song without stopping explained that it  "was
 
as  long as the trail from Texas to Wyoming";  father's own
 
collection eventually numbered more than more than two
 
hundred verses.  As it was  indeed the primary song about trail
 
life  it had to be trail-long,  and its  laconic direct
 
detailing of event after event telling you  just exactly
 what
 
happened always makes  it  for me the realest of all of them:
 
Come along,  boys,  and listen to my tale
 
I'll tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail
 
Come a ti yl yippy yippy yay,  yippy yay
 
Come a ti yi yippy,  yippy yay.
 
I started up the trail October twenty-third,
 
I started up the trail with the 2-U herd.
 
Oh my hoss throwed me off at the creek called Mud
 
My hoss throwed me off round the  2-U herd.
 
Cloudy in the west and looking like rain
 
And my damned old slicker's  in the wagon again.
 
The wind commenced to blow and the rain began to fall
 
And it  looked,  by grab,  like we' re gonna lose them all.
 
I jumped in the  saddle,  grabbed hold of the horn
 
I
' m the best damned cowboy ever was born.
 
18
 
Well I don't give a damn if they never do stop
 
I
'll ride as long as an eight day clock.
 
Well we herded and we hollered and we done very well'
 
Till the boss said,  Boys,  just let  'em go to hell.
 
Well we rounded them up and we put em on the cars
 
And that was the end of the 2 U bars.
 
I
' m going down town to get my money
 
I
' m going back home to see my honey.
 
As you can see,  this is a song that was made for the
 
trail -
 it could lope along fast or slow,  any number of new
 
verses could be fit into its scheme of rhymed couplets,  it
 
could be sung by one person or a group,  and it was infinitely
 
expandable,  to fit the length of any ride. A truly classic
 
work song.  And at the same time it told one or more stories,
 
like an occupational ballad,  with as much detail as the most
 
demanding audience could wish for.  One of my grandchildren
 
required it as his bedtime song for years,  not  just because
 
it was so long,  I think,  but because it was so interesting.
 
And he always made me tell him about the dogies.  An old-
timer once defined the word "dogie" for father as a new-born
 
calf "whose mammy was dead and his pappy had run off with
 
another cow".  The baby trail-born calves were indeed a
 
special responsibility of the punchers on the drives;  since
 
mother's milk was not available to these orphans they had to
 
eat grass before their digestive systems had matured.  Their
 
bellies swelled and they staggered along at the end of the
 
herd,  potential prey for coyotes and buzzards.  The cowboys
 
called them little "dough-guts",  and talked and sang to them
 
ancl about them constantly -
-
 "Roll on,  little dogies,  roll
 
on" -
-
 every now and again even picking one up and carrying
 
him horseback for a ways.
 
19
 
As  I was out walking one morning for pleasure
 
I spied a cowpuncher come a riding along
 
His hat was throwed back and his spurs was a-jingling
 
As he approached me,  he was singing this song.
 
Whoopie ti yi yo,  get along you little dogies
 
It's your misfortune and none of my own
 
Whoppie ti yi  yo,  get along,  you little dogies
 
For you know Wyoming will be your new home.
 
For me that was always the great one,  the single most
 
beautiful cowboy song that ever was. And my brother,  Alan
 
Lomax,  has traced its long journey and many changes from an
 
ancient Irish lullaby that the old ladies of Cork say was the
 
one that Mary sang to rock the baby to sleep;  he tells all
 
about it in Folk Songs of North America,  if you want to look
 
it up.
 
For whatever songs the cowboys already knew were grist
 
for their creative mills;  they changed old songs around and
 
borrowed tunes or never bothered with tunes at all,  just sort
 
of hollered or chanted verses ad lib -
-
 who cared? It was
 
like being on a baseball field,  when every player is supposed
 
to put up a line of chatter,  to help keep the action lively
 
and spirits high and,  incidentally,  to keep everyone aware of
 
just where everybody else is.  And there is clear
 historical
 
testimony that American cowmen who sang out got  jobs quicker
 
and kept them longer than the more silent types.
 
The cows seemed to like the singing too,  although I have
 
heard present-day musicians scoff at the idea that cattle
 
have anything resembling musical taste.  But old time
 
cattlemen talked about singing to the cattle in almost the
 
same terms current teenagers use to justify playing music
 
during homework hours -
-
 both groups maintain that music
 
covers up potentially disturbing ambient sounds.  Here's how
 
father said the night herding yodellling sounded -
 not a bit
 
Swiss style,  more of a crooning and calming sound.
 
Whoo -
 00  -
 00  -
-
 00
 
20
 
And certainly all the other peoples in the world who
 
handle large animals,  from the milkmaids of the British Isles
 
to the cattle herders of central Africa,  work their herds
 
while singing.
 
And so Irish tunes turned up in the American cowboy
 
stew,  along with African American and Spanish,  for the
 
cowpunching population was polyglot -
-
 there were southern
 
red-necks,  ex-slaves,  south of the border Spanish speakers,
 
English remittance men,  Mormons,  sod-busters,  New England
 
adventurers.  Father took down both "Home On the Range",  and
 
the classic "Sam Bass" from black trail hands; people used to
 
think that was comical when I said it,  but it was true..
 
And now what has happened to this stream of song,  and
 
what has happened to the cowboys since their brief glorious
 
star burst over the western plains?
 They have survived.  They
 
have changed.
 
Cattle are still raised for beef,  and experienced men
 
and women are still required to handle them;  they do not
 
raise themselves.  They even require occasional herding from
 
point to point,  although I have heard of a ranch in Hawaii
 
where the paniolos  (Hawaiian cowboys)  use mini-motorbikes
 
instead of horses.  I did see a group of young paniolos having
 
a round of beer in a roadside cafe on the big island and
 
poking hilarious fun at one of their number who was solid mud
 
from his Stetson to his boots.  Apparently you can still get
 
throwed,  even off a motor bike.  But today's ranching does
 
seem very like large scale farming.
 
It's even more striking how the songs have survived
 
and changed.  The first and most fundamental change was that
 
people began accompanying them with musical instruments.  You
 
may have noticed I failed to bring along my guitar this
 
evening.  Old time trail drivers didn't either;  when they were
 
singing work songs. they were busy.  I never heard of a
 
cowpuncher taking a guitar on the trail;  there was the rare
 
fiddle stashed in the chuck wagon -
 fiddles are small,  light-
weight -
 but never the auitar,  although many Mexican American
 
21
 
cattlemen undoubtedly played at the ranch-house.  The multiple
 
forms of the guitar developed in Mexico now sound not  just in
 
Hawaii but all around the world.
 
But when cowboy songs began routinely to be sung with
 
accompanying instruments,  they underwent a fundamental
 
change.  It turned them them from work songs into occupational
 
songs,  and that undoubtedly had to happen -
 when the work
 
pattern changes,  there is no longer need for the work song.
 
But then the insatiable demands of the music industry began
 
to be applied and gradually the pickers and grinners took
 
over;  you had to be able to play or at least harmonize to
 
sing a cowboy song in public,  and the way you sang or played
 
it f
l d to fit the current tastes of the professional music-
mongers.  Cowboy singing became less and less associated with
 
southwestern ranches and more and more with Hollywood and Tin
 
Pan Alley.
 
But another fascinating thing happened too.  As I have
 
already said,  not all the cowboy songs were actually sung.
 
Many of them didn't really exactly have tunes but tended to
 
be chanted or recited.
 
Most of the cowpunchers during the trail driving days
 
had been educated,  insofar as they had been,  in the one-room
 
country school houses of the period,  where a single teacher
 
exposed a group of mixed-age children to learning,  armed only
 
with a few readers and a few slates. Oral recitation
 
therefore was frequent,  memorization was highly regarded,  and
 
if you got that far you could take college courses in
 
elocution.  Local entertainments featured the recitation of
 
classic poetry,  or sections from great public addresses,  and
 
original poems that had been composed in honor of the
 
occasion.  So today we know the real names of many cowboy
 
authors;  lots of them wrote poems or songs themselves.  There
 
was nothing special about that in those times.
 
And do you know,  to this day,  there still isn't?  I
 
firmly believe that every single American has at some time or
 
another written at least one poem;  it certainly is one of the
 
22
 
first things we all think of to do when something
 
unimaginable happens.  I understand that the broadcast
 
stations of the nation were flooded with poems written by
 
anguished citizens immediately after the Kennedy and King
 
assasinations.  And even if we're too shy to admit writing
 
poems,  we still love them;  the number of masculine wallets
 
that contain a tightly folded copy of The Shooting of Dan
 
McGrew suitable for taking out and reading aloud or
 
exchanging for a copy of Lasca -
-
 I believe to this day there
 
are still lots of them around.
 
And nowadays,  in line with our tendency to organize
 
things,  you can go to cowboy gatherings and listen to the
 
fellows reciting their poetry,  always from memory.  They go on
 
for days,  these events;  it's like being back in Homer's time
 
where the bards fill you in on what's been going on and
 
remind you of the glories of the past.  The grand-daddy of
 
these remarkable events,  as you probably know,  takes place in
 
Elko,  Nevada,  every January,  smack in the middle of winter
 
when the fellows can take time off from their ranch jobs.  The
 
Oregon poet,  Kim Stafford,  had this to say about it all.
 
I
' ve come to watch all year for that first sight of Elko
 
at dusk,  late January,  that distant neon ruby glittering
 
like a star,  as  I come down south off Doby Summit.  I
 
know I
'll soon be treated to round after round of poems
 
and stories -
-
 voices to teach me the pleasures of
 
solitude and the raw work of hoof and hand.  When the
 
poets get  started,  rhymes in the poems stand like
 
streetlights every half block along Idaho Street,  every
 
little light earned like a season's wage.  An old fellow
 
at Capriola's told me last winter,  "Son,  you can have
 
more fun in Elko by accident than you can anywhere else
 
on purpose,  because you can do anything you're big
 
enough to get away with,  and after a couple drinks you
 
feel pretty damn big in this town!" I knew he'd said
 
that many times.  His  stating of it had the polish of
 
23
 
old leather braid.  And the rhymes I heard at the
 
Gathering,  yes,  I could predict them,  but that didn't
 
dull their pleasure.  When you lift the coffee cup to
 
your u ps for the tenth time on a cold day,  you get so
 
you can predict  its bitter kiss,  but that doesn't make
 
you ever want to stop.
 
I remember one rhyme at the end of a poem about an
 
old dog,  the kind of good dog you remember and brag
 
about.  As the reciter came cantering slower toward the
 
poem's end,  we could see the glow of that last rhyme
 
like moonrise over the horizon and then it was there.
 
And now I walk these hills alone.
 
The tough lady editor beside me ran out of Kleenex then,
 
and I had a little trouble myself.
 
Woody Guthrie would have liked that piece that Kim
 
Stafford wrote.  Father always said that Woody was the best
 
cowboy song singer of the modern times,  and I think I know
 
why.  Woody never worried about seeing that corny old-timey
 
rhyme cantering up over the horizon; he wanted you to face
 
that rhyme in all its human inevitability.  He wanted you to
 
hear and understand the shared humanity of the story it was
 
bringing you.
 
I once had a student who chose Woody Guthrie as the
 
subject of his term paper,  but it turned out that he had just
 
heard about Woody,  he had never heard any of his recordings
 
So I said he had better give them a listen and he did and
 
returned most perturbed.  "I  just don't like his recordings,
 
Mrs.  Hawes;  I sing some of his songs myself and I thought I
 
would like them,  but  I really don't. Now what do I do?"
 
I suggested that he give it another week.  You have met
 
another human being,  warts and all,  when you hear Woody.  He
 
played a totally straight-forward unornamented guitar in a
 
totally straight-forward unornamented way,  sometimes getting
 
on to a chord and not changing it for the entire song.  That
 
takes some stamina to listen to,  I
'll admit,  but after a
 
while you beqin to take to it.  And Woody sang the way cowboys
 
24
 
used to sing,  father said,  without guile or seductiveness -
-
flat out,  tense,  masculine,  earnest,  often strained.  Cowboys
 
used to bawl and holler,  father said.
 
Well,  ny student finally came back and told me that in
 
desperation he had tried playing Woody with the volume turned
 
way low so that it would fade into the background and my
 
student could kind of be exposed to the music subliminally.
 
And he said to me in despair,  "But that didn't work either,
 
Mrs.  Hawes.  Woody just wouldn't let me not listen to him.  I
 
had to turn up the volume and pay attention if I was going to
 
listen at all."
 
That's the great ballad style -
 the narrative voice -
 
that cuts away everything extraneous to the story that's
 
being told and tells it to you in a way that makes you
 
listen. My brother Alan's cross-cultural research shows that
 
this is one of the great vocal styles of the planet and that
 
it has moved around the globe in rough alignment with the
 
herders of big animals,  the horsemen,  the men and women who
 
have daring and important stories to tell. We in the United
 
States are lucky to have hosted it in our western states.  And
 
I think we are also lucky that my father,  along with the
 
other intrepid folklorists of his day and later,  was there to
 
record it in its classic development,  for it is no longer
 
there in the old way nor will it ever be exactly again.  But
 
who knows what musicians and singers of tomorrow may take
 
inspiration from these spare,  beautiful and rugged songs?
 
Today as we struggle to help maintain the variety of natural
 
life around the planet,  we must concern ourselves also with
 
the support of cultural variety while we can still catch the
 
echoes of these varied musical systems and hear them speaking
 
to our hearts.
 
If there is one thing I hope you will remember from this
 
evening it is that the voices and skills of people who are
 
generally not counted as professional artists -
-
 like the
 
cowboys -
-
 are worth paying attention to.  You have in your
 
state several remarkable people who are helping keep alive
 
25
 
and vibrant the traditional repertoires and skills of
 
Colorado;  Bea Roeder,  Ronna Lee Sharpe,  and Kathleen Figgen
 
are working double-time and half-paid in different parts of
 
Colorado to do the kind of thing my father did all those
 
years ago.  They deserve your support and your applause.  A
 
small amount of federal money matched by a small number of
 
state dollars goes to their support.  Stop thinking about
 
taxes for a minute or two and keep these dedicated people at
 
their jobs.  Your children and your grand-children will thank
 
you for it.
