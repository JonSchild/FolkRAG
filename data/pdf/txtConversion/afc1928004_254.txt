what was the difference between Gen. Grant and Stokes, 
brought down the house. 
The dinerence Is that Grant was

by a 
dozen blockheads, and showing in the most emphatic 
manner, the difference between the law for the rich and for the 
poor. — Jersey City Journal.

A fight or a

We're always to be found. 
Shure Old Ireland is the place, 
For a

if you're not mighty shy, 
Shure they'll blacken up your eyes, 
So look out, me boys, 
If you're not on the right side, 
For the divil is to pay 
When sticks they let fly. 
Yes, we are,

PADDIES FROM CORK. 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1t175, by A. J. 
risnLr., in he o1fico of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Written and sung by the GREAT FIELDINGS. 
A 
few years ago. from Ireland we sailed, 
,Upoit a 
big ship that carries the mail ; 
Nine days from the time that we left the Green Isle, 
We were both landed on American Soil. 
'Twas at Castle Garden we first struck free clay. 
To see the City we walked up Broadway. 
As we kept walking, the people would stare, 
Remarking, " Who is that beautiful pair !" 
Cnor.us. 
They're Paddies from Cork ! 
Paddies from Cork! 
Only just landed in sweet New York. 
Each one we meet. 
Says 
There's two Green Horns, 
They're Paddies from Cork !" 
Since we have landed. we've traveled a 
bit, 
And have not seen half this country yet. 
Tye 1,arnt a 
lot, the short time I'm here ; 
Yes, he has learnt to drink Lager Beer; 
Yes, and play Billiards and Bagatelle ; 
And smoke his Cigar just like a 
swell ! 
Some day of this City I 
may be Mayor. Miss, 
Then I 
shall be known as the Mayorcss ! 
We're not from Cork. but the City Dublin ; 
And she to the world has give some c,,nat men. 
In Ireland to-day, in almost any part. 
You'll find many the man equally as smart, 
But the Government that rules won't let them rise, 
So what they possess, of course with them dies. 
Some. who's good fortune is to get to New York, 
Are greeted, when landed, as Paddies from Cork! 
Chorus as before, 
Erin, Shall we See Thee No More? 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875 by A. J. 
FISICER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Written and sung by the FTELDINGS. 
Erin, dear Erin, when again shall we see thee? 
Those dear days of yore, we ile'er can forget, 
When children, your Emblem, 
The Shamrock, we cherished ; 
But now, in a 
strange land, 
We linger and fret. 
enonns, 
Erin, dear Erin, 
Shall we never caress thee, 
Or gaze once again 
On thy green mossy shore ? 
Our hearts they are beating, 
For friendless we wander. 
Erin dear Erin, 
Shall we see thee no more. 
Erin, dear Erin. our heart's fondest treasure, 
Both day and by night, our thoughts are with thee. 
Our Fathers and Mothers, 
God bless and protect them. 
Oh! when shall we ever, 
Their dear faces see?

I

Please give us a 
call, we sell everything cheap; 
You can't miss the house, sure, for the door stands ajar, 
And our sign reads the Mullahay's Bazar.

We sell pins and pails, 
Needles and oat meals; 
Corn starch and nails, 
Cream tarts and fine ales, 
Potatoes and Bay rum.

Our business was poor ' till we put ont.n. sign, 
Reduction in prices—now business is fine ; 
What we drop on prices, sure you lose in weight. 
Others do it, so must we. or lose our tradl. 
'We sell pins, &c. 
When we first started. twas on a 
gallon of gin; 
They called me a

And now I 
am known as a 
Respectable Man!

Written by JOIIN IfIrLDING. 
Sung by the FIELDING5. 
When first we struck this country, 
You never saw such a 
pair. 
We were both green—also very lean; 
And kind cf on' was our hair. 
She wore an old homespun dress,

Big brogues and breeches short I 
We were a

treat for the boys.

We're not so green now as then, boys! 
Not so green now as then ; 
We went through your schools. 
When we were both fools. 
Were not so green now as then I 
They called us Gawks, and Hi Pubes; 
And about fifty more such names. 
We lugged bags full of bricks— 
Some cf you may have done the same. 
In the street we have kicked hats, 
And

We've chased Tom Collins a

And have had corl:s upon the nose!

Sung by the FIELDINGS. 
'
Written by JOITN Firt,-nrso. 
In this character, many songs we sing, 
Of various kinds, and funny things z 
But a 
new subject to light ni bring, 
In our usu'll poetical form. 
The subject is proofs you have every day, 
New changed by many in various ways. 
But in my estimation thereon, the decay, 
This climate for them is too warm. 
CHORUS. 
Snap your fingers at trouble, and wink at care. 
Of this world's pleasur.3s have your share : 
You may die to-morrow, then who will care 
Whether you're happy or not ? 
My father he often did say to me, Den, 
Don't tell a 
lie if you possibly can ; 
Have money, me boy, for that makes the man; 
Experience those to me taught. 
If you have no money what can you do? 
Like a 
ship on the ocean, without a 
crew ; 
Adrift on the boards, no course to pursue. 
This storm I 
one day fought.

THEN WE'LL TO EUROPE GO, 
Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1875, by A. J. 
FIEHER, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
Written and sung by the FIELD-
1\1GS. 
While in company with some friends 
Of ours, the other night, 
And the glorious time we had, 
It filled us with delight ; 
But during the evening, one of mu,' friends 
Was anxious for to know, 
What we thought of Europe ? 
And if ever back we'd go ? 
When Gus Williams walks a 
rope, 
And Tony Pastor is made a 
Pope, 
And all the Ladies have a 
vote, 
And Lager cease to flow; 
When Ned Harrigan and Tony Hart, 
To make a 
living, must drive a 
cart! 
When this occurs, and not till then, 
Will we to Europe go. 
My friends they thought it kind of strange. 
To hear me speak this way. 
They thought it was a 
glorious place 
To pass the time away. 
It rains there both day and night; 
A 
fine day you seldom see; 
The Sun, likewise the Moon and Stars, 
They seem not to be free. 
When Billy Barry is Emperor of France, 
And Frank Gerard has learned to dance, 
And Larry Tooley, should by chance, 
As fat as Stewart grow : 
When Frank Kerns makes a 
leap for life; 
And Monkey George never gets tight, 
And Emma Day marries George Knight 
Then we'll to Europe go.

FIsissm, in the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Was'aLgton. 
Sung by the GunAr FIELDINGS. 
A 
bright May-day morning was joyously dawning, 
The birds carol d 
gaily through hedge-row and tree. 
But my heart 'mid the gladness was weary with sadness, 
For Dermot, dear Dermot. was far, far from me. 
But ah ! what is that, is my fancy deceiving, 
Ah ! no, 'tis his own well known face that I 
see— 
And though fancy deceive us. sure " seeing's believing," 
As he cries " Kathleen, darling, I'm come back to thee." 
And though fancy deceive us sure " seeing's believing," 
As he cries, Kathleen, darling I'm come back to thee." 
Old songs we were singing, sweet memories bringing, 
As we sat side by side at our own cottage door. 
And he promis'cl that never again we should sever, 
For he'd part from dear Erin and Kathleen no more. 
Tho' years have pass'd by, still in fancy's bright day-dreams 
My rnena'ry reverts to that sweet May-day morn. 
When the sunbeams shone brightly, and Ards carord lightly 
To joyously welcome my D.ernot's re 
When the sunbeams shone brightly, and birds carad lightly 
To joyously welcome my Dermot's return.

LITTLE NELLY RAY, 
As song by James McOale, the Engltsh comic, 
I 
LOVE a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rnsy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown 
hair; 
Her waist it is so lender, and her feet they are so small, 
t 
Of idl the girls I. ever loved my Nelly beats them all, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, charming little Nell, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle ; 
Nelly Ray, like birds of May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Nelly Ray. 
CHORUS. 
Her father keeps a 
farmhouse, in a 
village down in Kent, 
, And being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went ; 
And while a 
strolling through the fields, as on my way I 
roamed, 
It's there I 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home.. 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, ctn. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright, green grass, 
And words of love, I 
whispered to this young country lass; 
I 
placed my arms around her waist, af.7 Lea:: by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged 'Lc 'be my bride. 
Nelly Ray, Ne117,, 
Ray, etc. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy wc 
shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the heads of her or me; 
But in our farmhouse we'll be happy night and day. 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brightest 
ray.

PULL DOWN TEE BLIND. 
As S11119: by TONY PAsTon. -
DID you ever make love? If not, have a 
try, 
I 
courted a 
girl once, so bashful and shy, 
A 
fair little creature who by the by, 
At coaxing and wheedling had such a 
nice way; 
Ev'ry ni-ht to her house I 
went, 
In harmless derght our eveninrr3 were spent, 
She had a 
queer saying, whatever it meant, 
For whenever I 
entered her house she would say : 
CITOT: CS. 
Pull down the blind, pull down the blind, 
Pull down the blind, love, come don't be unkind. 
Though were alone, bear this in mlnd, 
Somebody's looking, love, pull down the blind. 
now loving we wer:,. ! low co.zy we'd chat, 
'Bout one thing and rother, and this thing and that, 
With my arm rmfml her waist, how c).sy we sat, 
Like two .little turtle- doves i 
r-hpil on a 
tree; 
Such squeezing and teasing 
il p!e : sing we had— 
wooing and cooing to ma!: our hearts glad, 
With langhin- and eh:If:ling I 
m,tir drove her mad; 
Dut still she was awfully spooney on me. 
SPokEN.—And if that soldiei. would only have left us alone, 
the would never have exclaimed: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
One night, for a 
change, we went. to the play, 
And when we got home she was awfully gay, 
She saw them make love, and so learned the way, 
The piece was " Claude Melnotte," and suited her tine; 
ziIle called me her rose- bud, her duck, and her dear, 
i_he threw her arms round me, while fast fell each tear; 
She cried. oh, don't leave me, for sadly I 
fear 
You don't love me truly, say, will you be mine? 
81 
SPOKEN,— Just at that moment, a 
policeman passed, and she 
said: 
Pull down the blind, etc. 
Our courting days o'er, at last we were wed, 
I 
oft bless the hour when to church her I 
led, 
I 
now cali her Mary, she calls me Ned, 
We're happy and loving, and never know strife; 
We've a 
line handsome lass, and two noble boys, 
Trouble or sorrow, never us annoys; 
Of life we've the sweets, and while tasting its joys, 
I'm thankful I'm blessed with a 
good little vile.

meek smile on her face she'll exclaim:

THE GAY MASQUERADE. 
Sur.g by ELLI W ESNER. 
SOME like garden parties, some like flower shows, 
For doing some spoonim, just " under the rose," 
Some are partial to concerts, or lectures so staid, 
But my weaknes3, 1 
fear, is the gay masquerade.

I'm awfal:y fond of the gay masqtrrade, 
The gay musquera(le, the bright masquerade, 
With sweet pier y 
darlings in costume arrayed ? 
The gay masquerade for rim. 
Some dances are like Quakers' rneciings in style, 
So ' starchy," and formal, one scarce sees a 
smile; 
But to do as one 
wilhout feeling afraid, 
By jove the right place is the gay masquerade.

The gay masquerade for me. 
To say most daring things, ' Us the easiest:task, 
To FOE213 elegant cre..ture whilst wearing a

have made— 
There's no place for firting like the gay masquerade,

I'm awfully fond of the gay masquerade, 
The gay masquerade, the bright masquerade,

THE HAT ME FATHER WORE.

I'M Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea, 
For singing or f)r dancing, bus, I 
think that I'll please ye; 
I 
can sing and (lance with any man, as I 
did in clays of yore, 
And on Patrick's Day I 
love to wear the Hat me father wore, 
CHORDS. 
It's old, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so 
green. 
From my father's great ancestors it descended with gallon— 
It's a 
relic of old da.cency, is the hat me father wore. 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you I 
say, 
And when I 
croEs the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To.be welcomed back to Paddy's Lind with the hat me father 
wore. 
It is old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see. 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome,me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer nie more and 
more, 
And make me Irish heart feel glad with the hat rue father 
wore. 
It's old, etc.

When your hair is silver white,

Locks may lose their Drown and gold; 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will knOw, 
Never, never, winter's frost and chill; 
Summer warmth is in them still— 
Never wiiiter*s frost and chill, 
Summer warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I'm growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair, 
What to us is sliver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below; 
Since I

You have never older grown— 
Since I

You have never older grown.

,IMIT NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL lab 
WELL RUNS DRY 
'FFIEN a 
child I 
lived at Lincoln with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
charm; 
-She would often take me on her knee when tired of ellildish 
play, 
And as she pressed me to her lirecLq I've heard my mother 
say— 
Waste not, v•aat not, 12 a 
maxim I 
would teach; 
Let your watchwordLa" 'dispatch," and practice what you 
• 
preach; 
Do not let your chances, 11::e sunbeams., pass you by, 
For you never miss the waLr till the \veil runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seem'd my only sport, it was my only joy; 
And well do I 
reinembel., when ofttimes well chastised, 
low father sat beside Inc then and thus has Inc a 
lvised. 
Waste not, 4-
;c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, I 
einhark d 
i 
pahl:c 
And found it was a 
rua-zed road bestrewn with care and striff.; 
I 
speculated Lao ishiv. inn losses'A-or,: sovere, 
But still a 
tiny, little voice kept wilisp'rhig in mine car. 
Waste not, 4:c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy, and found, to my surprise, 
My funds, instead of   
yemv 
den did rise, 
I 
grasp'd each chance and always strucl; the iron while ,twas 
hot, • 
I 
r,eiz'd my opportunities and never 9ncs fors—. 
Waste Dot, 3:-(4. 
Im.' married now and happy , I've, a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and hannony, devoid of care and strife; 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have lltde children three, 
The lessons that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee 
Is, waste not. 4.te.

No cne who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable rrom. Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal cf the life of Charlotte Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy T.emplz. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the unfortunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the richest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disapPointmenis and mu resulting from once yiz-1.-.1-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rapt attention to the end.
