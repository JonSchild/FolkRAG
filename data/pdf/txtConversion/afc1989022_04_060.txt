Thursday December 7, 1989: 
I left Salt Lake City about 8:30 AM. 
The weather was cold 
but there was no snow. 
Blanton Owen was waiting for me at the 
airport in Elko, Nevada, when I arrived about 11:15 AM. 
We ate 
lunch, talking over the work that lay ahead, and departed in 
Blanton's plane about 12:00 PM. 
The ride was smooth and I 
quickly realized that in this wide open country fieldwork by 
airplane is the only way to go. 
We covered the miles down to 
Benny Damele's Dry Creek Ranch in about 45 minutes, arriving just 
before 1 PM. 
Before landing, Blanton made several low passes over the 
ranch. 
I took some photographs from the open window [Blanton and 
I had done this before in Utah, so it came easily now even with 
the cold temperatures]. 
The aerial introduction to the place 
also gave me a chance to size up the job and make a plan for the 
afternoon's documentation. 
On the ground, I was introduced to Benny Damele, a small, 
weathered man with a wry smile, who showed us around. 
The 
buildings were typical examples of Nevada Buckaroo ranch 
architecture: there was a stone ranch house, a stone bunkhouse 
and tack shed, a long semi-subterranean horse barn, a large 
chicken coop, as well as the usual assortment of corrals, loading 
chutes, and the like. 
I had decided from the air that the barn 
should have priority and spent most of the afternoon sketching 
and measuring it. 
These flat-roof, partially open barns are 
ubiquitous in Buckaroo country but have successfully escaped 
scholarly attention. 
Blanton took photographs, while Andrea 
Graham, who had met us there with the car, talked to Benny and 
helped by holding the end of my tape measure. 
We finished the 
barn about 4:00 and it was getting both cold and dark. 
Andrea 
and I recorded the dimensions of the main ranch house, a 
rectangular stone structure that had received a front-facing 
gabled extension. 
As darkness fell, and after a glass of wine and some talk 
IAW-TC-F120789 - 
2 
with Benny and his foreman, Bill Eddy, and Bill's wife, Pam, we 
departed. 
Blanton flew on to Eureka alone -- there was some 
concern about getting the plane off the ground quickly -- so I 
drove back to town with Andrea and the project photographer, 
Valerie Parks, who had joined us that afternoon. 
I felt like I 
was catching cold, so I went to bed early, after supper.

Friday December 8, 1989: 
The field team gathered early for breakfast, about 7:30 AM. 
I 
was feeling much better and was excited by the opportunity to 
look carefully at the town of Eureka, a place I had heard much 
about but had not visited. 
Our plan was to spend the day in 
Eureka documenting the material evidence of Italian-American 
activity there. 
My feeling from the beginning was that our Eureka work 
should target as much as possible the experience of the average 
immigrant. 
I was not so much interested in finding the rare 
survival of Old World tradition as I was in documenting the 
buildings that most Italian-Americans inhabited and used, and 
these buildings were likely to be fairly typical American mining 
town buildings. 
As it turned out, I was right. 
After breakfast I had Blanton drive me around for a quick 
windshield survey of the town. 
We cruised all the streets and it 
quickly became apparent that Eureka was a standard western mining 
town with a gridiron plan and a commercial center along main 
street containing the court house, city hall, bars, and principal 
businesses. 
To both sides were the houses. 
Missing, however, 
were most of the industrial buildings -- the smelters, processing 
plants, and so forth. 
Eureka's industrial past has been largely 
demolished, and what we have left is a sleepy little town that 
betrays little of its former urban identity. 
Still, residents 
pointed out to us where the smokestacks had once stood, and early 
photographs showed Eureka in its heyday as a bustling town of 
several thousand where the smoke blackened both sky and people. 
Within this context it was not difficult to identify the 
principal local house types. 
The surviving buildings, coupled with copies of the Sanborn 
Fire Insurance Maps that I found at the county courthouse, 
suggested that the single-family house was the most common type 
of dwelling in the community. 
Within this category the most 
common house type was the one story T-cottage, or cross-wing 
IAW-TC-F120889 - 
2 
form. 
T-cottages are found in mining and railroad towns 
throughout the West and generally date to the 1880-1900 period 
[For a good discussion of the form see Deborah Randall, "Park 
City, Utah: An Architectural History of Mining Town Housing, 
1869-1907" (Master's Thesis: University of Utah, 1985), 83-99; 
and Thomas Carter and Peter Goss, Utah's Historic Architecture: A 
Guide (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1988), 37-43.] 
The John Gibellini House on Matthew Street is a typical example 
of the t-cottage in Eureka. 
Valerie Parks photographed the 
Gibellini House, but since no one was home we could not document 
the plan. 
Other commonly encountered house types in Eureka are the 
side-passage and single-cell. 
In the side-passage type the 
narrow end of the house faces the street, making it an ideal 
dwelling for compact urban neighborhoods [see Dell Upton, 
"Pattern Books and Professionalism: Aspects of the Transformation 
of Domestic Architecture in America, 1800-1860," Winterthur 
Portfolio 19 (Summer/Autumn 1984): 107-150]. 
Side-passage houses 
are found in western mining towns from New Mexico to Montana and 
range in size from small one-story frame cottages to large 
two-story brick mansion. 
In Eureka we documented a typical 
example of the side passage form. 
It was located on Silver 
Street and was a single story high and built of brick. 
No 
history of the house was available but the house and others like 
it were undoubtedly home to many Italian-Americans living in 
Eureka during the late nineteenth century. 
The smallest houses in Eureka were no more than a single 
room and the "Morris House" on Matthew Street, is a good example 
of these modest dwellings. 
According to Louis Gibellini the 
house was built for "Scotty and Dave Morris, who were Jewish 
miners." 
The stonework on the house was probably the work of 
Italian masons in the area. 
My goal was to have by the end of the day data on the 
principal nineteenth-century house types in Eureka. 
The John 
Gibellini House, the Silver Street House, and the Morris Cabin 
filled the main headings, so I spent the remaining time looking 
at less common building types. 
These included the Albert Biale 
House, built in the 1870s for the superintendent of the Ruby Hill 
Mine; the Assay Office, a two level brick and stone building that 
once served as a gathering point for local miners; Fernando 
Breneti's Boarding House, a narrow brick apartment building 
attached to the end of Breneti's hardware store; and Louie 
Gibellini's Blacksmith Shop, a frame shack standing behind 
Louie's bar on Main Street (see field notebook). I finished this 
work late in the afternoon and went almost immediately to bed, 
still feeling the effects of some unknown virus.

Saturday December 9, 1989: 
We arose early again for today we had to make the long 
journey down to Lincoln County and the Delmue Ranch. 
After 
breakfast we loaded into Valerie's car and drove to the airport 
outside Eureka. 
We took off around 9 AM. 
The flight lasted 
about two hours and although the day was bright and sunny the 
ride was extremely bumpy. 
We were packed into Blanton's small 
plane with all our gear -- I was in the back with Valerie -- and 
I thought I was going to be airsick on several occasions. 
We 
landed sometime before 11 AM in Panaca, Nevada, and I was 
relieved to be on the ground. 
I felt better knowing I was not 
alone. 
Everyone, even Blanton, had been bothered by the cramped 
quarters and rough air. 
I thought pilots never got sick!! A car 
was waiting for us when we landed, although we had a hard time 
getting it started after our lunch in Panaca. 
I didn't care, I 
was just glad we were on the ground. 
Panaca itself was 
interesting as a good example of a western Mormon town, so we 
drove around for 10 or 15 minutes looking at the buildings there. 
I took some photographs and noted the presence of several 
excellent examples of Mormon adobecraft. 
We had buzzed the Delmue Ranch on the way in and again I had 
an opportunity to concoct a plan for the day's work. 
Blanton had 
already measured the house and the larger of the two barns, so I 
concentrated on the original barn and the rear of the house, the 
part that stuck back into the hillside that Blanton had left out 
of his initial drawing (See, In a High and Glorious Place: 
Folklife in Lincoln County, Nevada (Reno: Nevada State Council on 
the Arts, 1987). 19) 
I pulled the barn plan and then drew the 
elevation, noting with interest the distinctive plate assembly. 
After the barn, I turned my attention to the rear of the 
house. 
The house itself was stone and had the tripartite plan 
that seems to have been popular throughout northern and central 
Europe, but one which I had not expected to find among Italians 
in Nevada. 
I found myself wishing that I could get over to Italy 
IAW-TC-F120989 - 
2 
and find out what the buildings were like in the Delmue's home 
country. 
I suspected that the Old World parallels must be 
strong, since Joe Delmue's place in Lincoln County was decidedly 
unique in my Nevada experience. 
This wasn't your standard 
Buckaroo Ranch. 
The subterranean part of the house was very 
difficult to measure since there were no real walls -- the whole 
back of the house seemed to be chiseled out of the hillside. 
I 
did the best I could and finished just at sunset. 
Blanton and I 
climbed up to the ridge above the ranch and I was struck by both 
the beauty and the isolation of the place.

Monday June 18, 1990 
Steve Siporin, project coordinator, asked me to spend June 
18th doing reconnaissance survey in Carbon County for the 
Italian-American project. 
I met Steve for breakfast in Salt Lake 
City about 9 AM and we then proceeded to Carbon County in two 
cars; Steve was going to spend the entire week doing fieldwork 
but I was along only for one day. 
My agenda for the visit 
included the following: I wanted to reacquaint myself with the 
place--almost ten years had elapsed since I had spent any 
appreciable time in the area; I felt that Steve and I needed to 
decide definitely which sites were to be recorded; and finally, I 
wanted to contact the owners of each site so that we could 
proceed expeditiously with our documentation when the students 
arrived in August. 
After lunch in the Helper cemetery--which contained many 
well-crafted gravestones bearing the names of Carbon County's 
many immigrant families--we made our rounds. 
As in Nevada, I 
wanted our architectural data to reflect the wide range of 
immigrant building activity in the area. 
This meant that, 
ideally at least, I needed to find examples of buildings 
reflecting the acculturative process as well as those 
representing the older Italian folk tradition. 
Remembering my 
earlier work in the county, I was drawn immediately to the 
Camillo Manina house in Spring Glen. 
The Manina house was built 
back into a bluff outside the town and presented a striking 
resemblance to the hillhouses I had seen in books of northern 
Italian architecture. 
Raymond Winklereid, a businessman from 
Helper, owned the Manina house, and I spent most of the afternoon 
trying to phone him to get his permission to draw it in August. 
[I finally reached Winklereid the next morning. 
He said he was 
ill and couldn't be bothered with our business at the moment, but 
said to call back next week.] 
After the Manina house, Steve and I drove to Helper in order 
to inspect the outdoor bake oven at Catherine and Wille Verde's 
IAW-TC-F061890 - 
2 
house. 
The Verdes had welcomed me into their house ten years 
before, but now both were dead and I was not sure what had 
happened to the oven. 
The house was closed up but the yard was 
tidy and a big garden had been planted on the north side of the 
lot, so we figured that someone was taking care of the place and 
a return visit during the afternoon revealed it to be Lester and 
Edith Verde Pitts, Catherine and Willie's sister, who lived in 
Price. 
I tried to call Edith, but got no answer. 
Another phone 
call to make from Salt Lake next week, I thought. 
Our list of sites to be documented in August now included 
the Manina house and the Verde bake oven, both examples I felt of 
Italian folklife transported to Carbon County by the immigrants. 
But these buildings told only a small part of the story of 
Italian-American material culture in the area. 
Most of the 
immigrants quickly adopted the tangible trappings of the American 
twentieth century mining town and our work, to be accurate, 
needed to include some typical examples of immigrant housing. 
Since the two dominant dwelling types in the area during the 
boom years of immigration were the bungalow and the one-story 
foursquare cottage, I wanted to record at least one building from 
each of these categories. 
I remembered that several stone 
bungalows stood down on Railroad Avenue in Helper, but closer 
inspection showed these to be in extremely poor condition. 
Driving back through town, a line of stone foursquare cottages on 
Welby Street caught my eye. 
These houses seemed ideal for our 
purposes: they represented one of Carbon County's principal house 
types, very likely they had been constructed by an Italian stone 
mason, and as a group they helped articulate the urban qualities 
of Carbon County immigrant life. 
We stopped to look them 
over--they were vacant but still in good shape--and a neighbor 
told us that the Brunos who lived just up the street might know 
something about them. 
While I took some photographs, Steve 
walked up the street to the Brunos. 
Several minutes later I 
followed. 
Knocking at the Brunos' back door, I could see Steve talking 
to two older people who turned out to be John and Yolanda Bruno. 
Both John and Yolanda had come to America from Italy as children 
and had lived in Helper all their lives. 
Not only did the Brunos 
have a great deal to tell us about the history of Helper, but I 
quickly noticed that their house and lot might yield a wealth of 
information as well. 
The house was a bungalow, built in the 
1920s, and out behind it was a garden. 
This garden was different from the ones I was used to in the 
Mormon villages of central Utah. 
I could rows of garlic, onions, 
and peppers--the basic ingredients in Italian-American cuisine, 
and when John Bruno told us that the small shed out back was for 
making sausage and wine, both Steve and I knew we had found the 
right place. 
I asked the Brunos if we could come back in August 
IAW-TC-F061890 - 
3 
and make a detailed drawing of the garden and outbuilding. 
They 
agreed and we made arrangements for the return visit. 
I felt 
that the Bruno lot gave us something very important: an example 
of an American house fronting an Italian-American garden, and the 
site eventually became the main focus of our attention and energy 
during the fieldwork in August. 
The Brunos also gave us information about the row of stone 
cottages. 
They called it the Milano Court--it had been built by 
Italian immigrant Joe Milano--and believed that it had originally 
housed Milano's newly-arriving relatives. 
One of the cottages 
was for sale, so I called the real estate agent and received 
permission to include the Milano Court in our work. We now had 
the Manina house, the Verde bake oven, the Bruno garden and 
outbuilding, the Milano court--all that was left was to check out 
a large stone building that David Taylor of the Library of 
Congress had spied during an earlier reconnaissance visit to 
Carbon County. 
Taylor had asked us to look at the building--he 
called it a bunkhouse--and possibly include it in our work if we 
had time. 
The bunkhouse was in Columbia over in East Carbon, so 
at the end of the day Steve and I made the half- hour or so drive 
down there to check it out. 
We didn't know exactly where this building was--I hadn't 
been there before--so we drove around Columbia looking for 
something that was big and built of stone. 
We had no trouble 
finding it and at once I knew why David had been drawn to it. 
The building was long--it looked to be about fifty feet long--and 
had a broad gable roof. 
There were porches and doors on the east 
and west elevations indicating the presence of small rooms on 
both sides. 
The stonework was competent if not spectacular, but 
the overall structure was impressive. 
We found the owner, Mrs. 
Arvetta Satterfield, who told us that the building had served as 
a bunkhouse for single miners working at the Columbia Steel 
Company mine. 
Greeks and Slovenians as well as Italians resided 
there, according to Mrs. Satterfield, but an Italian, Michael 
Sepi, was responsible for the stonework. 
I knew it would take 
time to draw the building, but felt it was important to our work 
so I made arrangements with Mrs. Satterfield to return in the 
weeks ahead. 
Steve and I drove back to Price just after sundown. 
We ate 
dinner and then backtracked to Wellington and our motel. 
I was 
pleased with our list. 
Not only were these buildings interesting 
architecturally, but they also were representative of the 
Italian-American architectural experience in Carbon County. 
If 
we could get into them all--and only the Manina house remained 
problematic on this count--our contribution to Steve's project 
could be significant.

After breakfast, I called Mr. Winklereid about getting into 
the Manina house. 
He was quite short with me, telling me he was 
ill and didn't want to be disturbed. 
I told him I would send him 
information about our project that week and then call back to 
talk about what we were doing in Carbon County. 
He agreed. 
I returned to Salt Lake City, leaving Steve to get started 
with his fieldwork. 
Arriving at the University of Utah after 
lunch, I wrote letters to the owners of each site that we had 
decided to visit: The Manina House in Spring Glen, the Verde Bake 
Oven in Helper, The Bruno House and Garden in Helper, the Milano 
Court in Helper, and the Columbia Steel Company Bunkhouse in 
Columbia.

Wednesday August 1, 1990 
Steve Siporin, project coordinator, arranged for me to meet him 
in Price wednesday night. 
I didn't get out of Salt Lake City 
until after 8:30 PM, but arrived at the motel at 10:20 PM -- I 
made good time and the sunset was impressive. 
Checking in, I was reminded again that it had been 10 years 
since I worked in Carbon County for the Utah State Historical 
Society. 
I believe it was 1979 or 1980 that I came down and 
spent several days checking the results of an architectural 
survey then being completed by the Society's preservation staff. 
The surveyors showed me the Manina House, the bake oven at the 
Verde House, and several other sites at that time. 
I was glad to 
have the opportunity to systematically document these sites for I 
feared that all except the Bruno House were threatened with 
destruction. 
Before bed, drinking a few beers, Steve and I talked over 
the schedule for the days ahead. 
I wanted to make the best use 
of the time we had for the architectural documentation so I asked 
him to help us out by doing the oral history for our sites. 
He 
agreed to do it--Steve's a good boss. 
I still had not received permission from Raymond Winklereid 
to document the Manina House in Spring Glen. 
That worried me 
because I continued to believe that this was an important site 
for us. 
I decided to call him once more in the morning.

Thursday August 2, 1990 
After breakfast Steve and I drove out to the Camillo Manina 
homestead in Spring Glen. 
The site is owned by Raymond 
Winklereid of Helper, a local businessman who owns a good deal of 
real estate in the area. 
Calls to Mr. Winklereid in June, and 
then again when we arrived on Wednesday night had yielded little 
but "I'm very sick call me later." 
Not having permission to 
enter the house, I was reluctant to press on but I wanted to show 
Steve the site and see if we could find some way of getting to 
Mr. Winklereid. 
We walked up to the trailer that sits on the 
front of the lot and met Mrs. Lavange McNeil, an eighty-five year 
old woman who rents from Winklereid. 
Mrs. McNeil was most 
gracious and offered to show us around. 
We decided to follow her 
on a tour through the old house despite our failure to 
successfully extract permission from Winklereid. 
I had never actually been inside the house, and when we 
entered with Mrs. McNeil I was pleased to see that the interior 
offered as much promise as the exterior. 
The ground floor 
consisted of two rooms, one the kitchen and the other a bedroom. 
To the east was a small connected stable. 
I knew that in Italy 
the lower level of such houses was reserved for livestock and 
finding the straw-filled enclosure next to kitchen seemed to 
support my view that there were Old World antecedents for the 
design of the house. 
Reassured that documenting the Manina house 
was crucial to our work in Carbon County I decided to go ahead 
with the documentation despite the inability to get official 
permission. 
Feeling that Winklereid probably didn't want to be 
bothered but had raised no objections to our work, I drove back 
to Price with Steve. 
At the motel I contacted Mrs. McNeil's 
daughter, Mrs. Tony (Lila) Busetto who lived in Price to make 
sure that we had not alarmed her mother by our visit. 
Also, I 
called Carrol Riddle in Helper to confirm our appointment to 
measure the Milano court. 
Steve and I also checked in with John 
and Yolanda Bruno. 
We would record Manina House and Verde Bake 
Oven on Thursday, the Milano Court and the Bruno's garden on 
IAW-TC-FO80290 - 
2 
Friday, and the Columbia Bunkhouse on Saturday. 
Susan Anderson and Margaret (Bee) Bergold, students in the 
Graduate School of Architecture, arrived in Helper about 10:30 
AM. 
After introductions and a brief discussion of the work plan, 
Susan, Bee, and I returned to the Manina house and began taking 
measurements. 
Steve brought us a (extremely meager) lunch on his 
way to do an interview. 
We finished the Manina house drawing and 
photography about 4 PM. 
From about 4:30 to 5:30 PM, Susan, Bee, and I surveyed 
various sites in Helper and then drove up to Standardville to 
check out a house at Steve's request. 
Steve thought it looked 
unusual and it was; the Standardville house appeared to be a 
cross between a traditional gable-front house and a bungalow. 
While noting the distinctive qualities of the house, we realized 
that our five sites would be more than enough for us to do in the 
time allowed. 
We returned to Helper and met Steve for dinner. 
I 
sketched the Manina plan in my field notebook and retired.

Friday August 3, 1990 
The day was a very busy and productive one. 
I have been very 
impressed by the work of Susan Anderson and Bee Bergold. 
I have 
had to give them very little instruction; they go about their 
work professionally and very quickly. 
We have been able to move 
much more rapidly that I had planned without sacrificing the 
quality of our product because both students have had extensive 
architectural training -- training noticeably lacking in both 
folklorists and historians. 
After breakfast we traveled again to Helper. 
I wanted to 
stop at the old Catherine Verde house and see if we could track 
down the current owner. 
Both Steve [Siporin] and Phil Notarianni 
had expressed interest in having a drawing of the outdoor bake 
oven there. 
Luckily we ran into Lester Pitts, husband of Edith 
Pitts, who is Catherine and Willie Verde's sister and the current 
owner of the property. 
Lowell was very accommodating. 
He gave 
us permission to return later that afternoon to measure the oven, 
since we had to be at the Bruno's at 10 AM. 
We arrived at the Bruno's a little after 10 AM. 
Yolanda had 
been cool on the phone the day before--I thought maybe she and 
her husband had changed their minds about us--but both she and 
John greeted us warmly this morning. 
John's brother Guy Bruno 
was present, visiting from the Bronx. 
We immediately were 
invited in for freshly baked bread--Frazila--which was just right 
with lots of butter. 
Folklore fieldwork always has its 
amenities. 
We sketched out the site plan for the Bruno house and lot 
and began measuring the outbuilding. 
Our work at the Bruno house 
took about five hours, from 10:30 AM to 3:30 PM. 
A short break 
of about thirty minutes helped. 
Susan Anderson proved a 
particularly able fieldworker, being accomplished in the social 
skills. 
I was impressed by her ability to chat up the Brunos and 
even engage them in her work. 
Overall I'm very pleased with the 
students' work, although I must say their drawing abilities 
relegated me to the role of photographer, a position that is a 
IAW-TC-FO80390 - 
2 
little uncomfortable since I've never considered myself an expert 
in this area. 
About 3 PM, while the Susan and Bee were finishing the Bruno 
documentation, Steve and I walked down to the Milano Court to 
begin measuring that site. 
After about half-an-hour interruption 
while a rain squall went through, we went on with the work and 
were soon joined by Susan and Bee. 
After the Milano Court drawing was finished, we returned to 
the Verde's where Mr. Pitts still waited--I think he wanted to 
see what we were going to do. 
We pulled a site plan and then 
Susan and Bee drew the bake oven. 
Several people from the 
neighborhood came to watch. 
We finished at the Verde site about 6:30 PM and everyone was 
exhausted. 
We drove back to price, had several beers at a local 
bar, and then returned to the motel for fieldnotes and the movie 
Godfather I. 
Somehow we all thought it was an appropriate 
gesture, although I think we all fell asleep before it was over.

Today was reserved for the Columbia Bunkhouse in Columbia, 
Utah. 
We left the motel about 8 AM and after breakfast drove the 
30 or so miles out to East Carbon and Columbia. 
Arvetta 
Satterfield was expecting us and had keys to several of the 
bunkhouse rooms. 
It seems that during the 1970s when the 
bunkhouse was closed, the rooms were sold off individually so 
that now there are several owners. 
We joked that this may have 
been one of the first condominiums. 
Mrs. Satterfield owns about 
ten of the rooms. 
She had kindly arranged for one former miner, 
Ivan McCourt, to come and explain the building to us. 
Mr. 
McCourt's commentary was very useful in piecing together the 
history of the building and its various functions. 
The bunkhouse was built in 1922-23 by the Columbia Steel 
Company as part of a larger complex that included a boarding 
house (dining hall) and a bathhouse. 
The stonework was executed 
by an Italian immigrant named Michael Sepi, who (according to Mr. 
McCourt) also was responsible for much of the masonry work at the 
mines themselves, including culverts, portals, and the like. 
The 
boarding house stood across the street to the west and now in 
heavily remodeled form serves as Mrs. Satterfield's house. 
The 
original wooden bathhouse stood to the north, but it was replaced 
in the early 1940s by a large concrete building. 
Although both 
buildings are now gone, the concrete floor of the later building 
remained and we spent some time working with Ivan McCourt to 
reconstruct the plan of this building. 
After sketching the bathhouse and the overall site plan 
(which included the boarding house, the bunkhouse, and the 
bathhouse), Susan and Bee drew the bunkhouse itself. 
We 
concentrated on the west and south elevations and the floorplan, 
finishing about 3:30 PM. 
Tired and hot (the temperature was in 
the 90s), we went down to East Carbon and bought some drinks 
(unspecified) for the ride back to Price. 
On the way we decided to drive over to another mining town, 
IAW-TC-FO80490 -

Hiawatha, in order to compare the buildings there with the ones 
we had seen in Columbia. 
Apparently Hiawatha had a company-owned 
hotel that served in the capacity of boardinghouse / bunkhouse / 
bathhouse and it still stands. 
We took several photographs 
before being stopped by the town sheriff who wanted to know why 
we were taking pictures on company--the U.S. Fuel Company owns 
the entire town site--property. 
We played dumb (it is so hard) 
and were pardoned, but decided that it was time to retreat back 
to Price and the motel. 
We had all been invited for dinner at 
the home of the Nics, an Italian-American family with whom Steve 
had previously worked. 
The dinner was sumptuous; I think I ate 
over 50 homemade ravioli. 
After dinner I was so full that I had 
to lie down for some time before being able to drive home, but 
somehow mustered enough strength to drag myself to the bar at the 
Day's Inn. 
Susan Anderson and I ended up attending the 25th 
Reunion Party of the Carbon County high school class of 1965, 
guests of Ivan McCourt's son Don, whom we had met in Columbia. 
It was a very long day.

Thursday December 13, 1990 
The university quarter just ended and I should be taking a few 
days off, but no--I had to open my mouth about the Delmue Ranch 
and now I'm snowed in at a motel in Fillmore, Utah. 
We shouldn't 
be doing fieldwork in December, but at least there are no snakes 
this time of year. 
Actually, the trip started out well enough. 
The Delmue 
Ranch in Lincoln County, Nevada deserved a set of real HABS 
drawings. 
The Delmue house and barn had such clear Old World 
connections that I felt they could become the centerpieces of the 
exhibit--maybe, but at least there should be a set of drawings; 
so I contacted David Taylor and suggested that I take several 
students back out there and draw it up right. 
He agreed, and 
after a couple of weeks hassling out a contract, we were ready. 
Darla Lindberg-Berreth, a design instructor at the University of 
Utah's Graduate School of Architecture, agreed to help supervise 
the drawings and recruited two first-year students, Steve Simmons 
and Doug Banks, for the work. 
Steve and Doug were initially 
along just for the money, but I believe by the end of the trip 
they had acquired a new appreciation for the buildings 
themselves. 
Maybe. 
Anyway, we could get out of Salt Lake City until after 6 PM 
because of Steve and Doug had had a test that only ended at noon, 
so we left right as the season's first major snow storm hit. 
Blowing snow isn't a lot of fun to draw in, but I felt that if we 
could get out of town and maybe a hour south then we would run 
out of the worst of it. 
Wrong. 
The snow turned into a full 
scale blizzard and we were only able to inch along; the defroster 
just couldn't keep the windscreen clear. 
The snow was about five 
to six inches deep by 10:30 pm and there was no sign of a break, 
so we pulled into Fillmore and ended the day about 100 miles 
short of our original destination, Cedar City. 
We got a motel 
and decided to make a early start, hoping to get out to the 
Delmue Ranch, get our measurements, and beat it back to Salt Lake

City before the next storm, forecast for saturday afternoon, 
hit.

Friday December 14, 1990 
I awakened early to first glimmers of sunlight on the newly 
fallen snow. 
I could tell by the snow accumulation on our car 
that the storm must have stopped soon after we had given up; no 
matter though, because there was a mountain pass between us and 
Cedar City that would have made our going slow and difficult. 
I 
hustled out, it was about 6:30 AM, and started the car. 
Doug and 
Steve stumbled out of their room about 7:00 and we left 
immediately. 
Interstate 15 was now snow-packed, but the morning 
was clear and we made good time to Cedar City, where we stopped 
for breakfast and some lunch groceries. 
The road west, US 56, 
was also snow covered; we made good time over the mountains to 
Nevada and arrived at the Delmue Ranch about 11:30 AM. 
The scene 
was striking: the ranch was covered with new snow sparkling from 
the sun which was now quite high and warming everything it 
touched. 
We bundled up, although we really didn't need our 
warmest clothes. 
Gloves were only necessary when we were in the 
shady north shadows of the buildings. 
Steve and Doug had experience measuring and drawing 
buildings, so they got to work immediately. 
A flip of the coin 
determined that Doug would do the house and site plan, while 
Steve would draw the barn. 
We recorded the barn first: Doug and 
I called out the measurements for Steve, who sketched the 
elevations and various details as he went. 
I helped measure the 
plan and the principal south and east elevations, but then turned 
to photography while Steve and Doug finished up with the details. 
We had a picnic of smoked oysters, cheese, and crackers on the 
rocks above the barn. 
It was about 2:30 PM when we turned to the site plan and the 
house elevations. 
I was astonished to find the work proceeding 
so quickly. 
We were all a bit cold, I guess, and were moving 
quickly. 
The thought too of the approaching saturday storm made 
us work all the faster. 
Still, I feel that we did the job 
thoroughly and professionally, if remarkably briskly. 
I took 
IAW-TC-F121490 - 
2 
more photos of the house while Doug and Steve worked out the site 
plan. 
I had forgotten my compass, so we painstakingly measured 
out the distances between the buildings from several angles so 
that we could place them on the drawings. 
After the site plan was finished, we finally tackled the 
house. 
It was now about 4:00; the intensity of the sun was gone 
and it was getting cold. 
The south and west elevations of the 
house gave us little problem, but the section was another matter. 
I wanted one drawing to show how the house was built back into 
the hillside; after some climbing and poking around, we decided 
to cut the section at a line just to the south of the chimney. 
Doug and Steve figured out as closely as possible where the 
mountain stopped and the house started--I had it slightly wrong 
on my 1989 plan--and I took some interior photos that would 
supplement the measurements when it came time to draw up the 
house. 
About the time we were finishing with the roof, about 
Tony Delmue came home. 
We had a lot of friendly chat and I liked 
Pete Tony a great deal; I had the impression from Blanton that he 
was pretty quiet, but he entertained us with some very funny 
stories over steaming plates of beef stew that Jody had made that 
day. 
Steve, Doug, and Pete Tony played some pool on the table 
that occupied a conspicuous place in the Delmue's living room. 
About 9:00, our work done and our stomachs full, we drove back to 
Cedar City under a sparkling canopy of stars. 
I was pleased that 
we had been able to accomplish so much in single, long day. 
We 
all felt some relief in thinking that we could beat the storm 
back to Salt Lake City on saturday--the forecast of course was 
wrong, the storm never came.
