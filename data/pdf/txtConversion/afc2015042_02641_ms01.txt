Summary of  Interview / Event: 
Benton Brown and Susan Boyle discuss the launch and operation of their affinage, Crown Finish Caves, in 
Brooklyn, New York. From constructing the facility to conducting research and development in their quasi 
mould laboratory, they share the experience of consciously entering into the international legacy trade of 
affinage, one not very well established in the U.S. With early careers in sculpture and environmental 
education, respectively, they discuss the skills they transferred to their current roles; reflect on the long arc of 
learning the legacy trade of affinage, their staff, operational logistics, partnerships with cheesemakers, and; 
their decision to replicate the Parisian model of affinage in which cheese is produced outside the city and 
aged inside the city, close to consumers and retailers. They reflect on the highly sensory labor of affinage and 
the financial, creative and public health opportunities and risks of working with a venerable and beloved, yet 
highly-regulated and sometimes dangerous food—cheese. 
Interview Log: 
0 00 24 Susan Boyle and Benton Brown introduce themselves as founding partner-owners and describe their 
respective roles/tasks within Crown Finish Caves (CFC). 
0 00 54 Benton Brown, the official affineur of CFC, details his work: finding cheesemaker partners, 
overseeing the daily functioning of the caves, invoicing, tasting, receiving and delivering cheeses, designing 
and fabricating cave equipment, installing and maintaining pumps, chillers, filters and compressors, intake 
fans, outtake fans, electrical issues, shelving design, and stainless welding—almost all of which is done in his 
adjacent metal and print workshop. 
0 02 25 Benton and Susan describe the affinage component of CFC. It’s both the pillar of the business a 
discreet component that hovers in the realm of R&D. Susan identifies the particularly fun part of the 
business: determining what washes to use with what cheeses. They discuss experimenting with with hard 
ciders, wines, beers, brines, and a various cocktails of cultures.  
0 03 36 CFC’s inaugural affinage partnership with Parish Hill Creamery in Vermont. CFC received and then 
washed their soft and semi-soft raw milk tomes with a hard cider. Through this partnership, Susan and 
Benton learned the nuances of R&D on the affinage end of cheesemaking. This partnership also helped 
them sort logistical matters, e.g., how long should a cheese stay in the walk-in? When should it be shipped to 
retailers? 
0 04 30 Susan describes CFC’s inception six years ago, in 2010. With their residential and commercial 
buildings in operation, they began thinking about what to do with the three old lagering tunnels (c 1880s) 
beneath their commercial property, Big Sue. [The building was the former Nassau Brewery.] 
0 05 31 Benton interjects and says he’d take the origins of CFC back further to 14 years ago (2002). We 
purchased a large brewery complex and we went through a series of zoning and renovations creating a 
residential and commercial component—the whole time knowing there were these underground components 
we wanted to do something with. For a decade we considered different things while focusing on generating 
income from the rental units.

0 06 04 We reached a point where we were able to work on this underground component, which is unusual 
for property like this. Not many of these underground tunnels remain in existence in New York City. They 
get torn down or sealed up. They’re turned into parking lots. It doesn’t pay to keep the caves [in a 
conventional business sense]. But the tunnels, these properties became our site-specific installation. We’ve 
given this property our lives and the tunnels are the last piece of the puzzle.  
0 06 48 In 2000, Benton decided he wanted to make cheese in the cellars. It seemed like the right 
environment. He took a cheesemaking course in Vermont as preparation/orientation. I learned we would not 
be making cheese on the property due to the lack of animals and milk we had at our fingertips here in 
Brooklyn. And so, we started to go down this path of affinage—the art of aging cheese. We focused on how 
we could do that in these tunnels.  
0 07 21 Benton describes taking affinage classes at Jasper Hill Farm in Vermont and outside of Lyon, France 
at the “train” caves of Hervé Mons [their training caves are located in a former train/railway tunnel, Tunnel de 
la Collonge, a space very similar to CFC’s]. Benton describes his affinage training in France as the most robust. 
From receiving and evaluating all styles of young, fresh cheeses to learning the rigorous safety, shipping and 
storing concerns of affineurs. 
0 08 08 Benton notes a difference between what characterizes CFC and others in the contemporary US 
affinage sector: CFC is located in an urban center where cheese is purchased and consumed, a distinct 
business advantage. Other comparable facilities such as Jasper Hill are in the rural U.S., connected to 
creamery and animals.  
0 08 33 Susan notes their urban base mimics the historic Parisian affinage model in which cheese was 
produced outside the city and aged inside the city. They explain the distinction between their work as an 
affinage/wholesaler and retail shops, with finishing components for direct-to-consumer sales. 
0 11 20 Susan describes CFC’s vision. They observed a need for affinage among smaller creameries/cheese 
producers that had neither the space nor time to age their cheese. We wanted CFC to fill this need and 
support small farms producing cheese. That remains part of our goal as a business.  
0 11 50 Yet, what we’ve learned is that we need to balance that goal with servicing larger producers so we can 
work with smaller producers to increase their volume.  
0 12 17 Benton underscores the shift in perspective from smaller to larger cheesemaker partners.  We have 
learned that it’s not possible to work with smaller creameries exclusively or even for a small percentage of our 
partnerships. Safety becomes a huge component to this business of affinage. When you’re moving 10,000 - 
20,000lbs of cheese, you cannot risk putting a tiny amount of one kind of cheese in the caves that could 
potentially put the whole facility at risk. Like Susan said, it’s a balance of bigger operations helping 
supplement the smaller ones. It’s a classic model. 
00 13 09 Susan touches on federal regulations involving cost-intensive requirements that can be good in 
protecting people but can also be cost-prohibitive for smaller operations. There are some policy changes that 
may potentially make it harder for us to work with smaller operations. The FDA is in dialogue with American 
Cheese Society so ideally it’ll get hashed out so new regulations won’t decimate small US cheese makers. 
0 14 54 Benton describes the physical caves/vaults of CFC. In the 1850s breweries, especially in Brooklyn, 
had underground vaults to ferment lager beer. It is this space that is now used to age cheese. 
0 15 24 Benton details the subterranean characteristics and measurements of the CFC caves/vaults, which sit 
about 30’ below street level.  
0 16 10 Benton and Susan discuss contracting the French company Clauger, which exclusively designs climate 
controlled spaces for yogurt, cheese, and related food processing operations. There isn’t a comparable

company located in the United States. We’re the tiniest project they’d ever worked on yet likely one of the 
most unusual given our adaptive reuse of a space. 
0 16 47 Benton describes the significant hurdles in establishing CFC, including jackhammering large holes 
through the caves’ brick ribs to allow for an appropriate flow of air to aging cheeses.  
0 17 10 The biggest issue with the caves was getting down there. How could we get workers and cheese easily 
in and out of the subterranean space? Susan and Benton installed an elevator shaft to carry pallets of cheese 
and workers. The elevator was preceded by a 30’ long, dizzying spiral staircase. Before that, ladders-only for 
many, many years. 
0 18 39 Establishing the caves also meant managing air flow. They needed an acutely designed hourly 
exchange of ammoniated air (a by-product of cheese aging that must be exhausted from the caves) with fresh 
air.  They acquired and installed HEPA filters [High-Efficiency Particulate Arrestance] and intake fans with 
variable speeds at one end of the cave so affineurs could regulate the rate of air entering. And, they installed 
an extraction fan at the other end of the cave to move ammoniated air out. 
0 19 10 As it turns out, the extraction fan moved so much fresh air through the caves that we had trouble 
growing moulds, mucor, and b-linens on the surfaces of some cheeses. It became too clean an environment. 
As a solution, we put in a check-valve at the end of the cave. What it creates is called “positive pressure” 
connected to door openings and closings. 
0 20 14 Description of the micro-climate chiller on the rooftop, 70-80’ high, used to provide cool air to the 
caves. 
  
0 20 51 The caves provide a perfect environment as they sit empty around 52-55degrees and around 90% 
humidity. But once you put 25,000lbs of cheese in there, it starts to get hot. Our whole system is designed for 
the volume of cheese that the cave can hold and so we do have to push cold climate into the space.  
0 21 24 Benton describes managing humidity in the caves.  
0 22 23 Susan and Benton discuss the skills needed to be an affineur and to run an affinage operation. It’s 
very sensory. You have to refine all of your essential senses of taste, smell, sight, touch for the rind and the 
paste of numerous styles of cheeses. You have to understand what is a defect and what’s not a defect at 
different stages. You’ll learn what feels right. What feels wrong. It’s very experiential. You must constantly 
build up your knowledge through experience.  
0 24 13 The trier tool is unique to affineurs. You use it to pull a plug of aging cheese and taste its paste. The 
trier tool allows a sample to be taken without disrupting the rind so that it seals and the wheel can still be 
“aged out.” 
0 24 47 - Visiting cheese producers. As affineurs we arrive at creameries with checklists, but fundamentally we 
need to trust, and like, the cheesemaker. Because as an affineur, you’re dealing with [purchasing and handling 
and ultimately being responsible for] dangerous product, in a way. You want to make sure everything is being 
done right, and safely. You need to be able to have an open dialogue about things. 
0 25 33 Susan describes different cheesemakers’s styles along a continuum of artistic or scientific. They’re 
looking for a balance of the two so that there’s room for the kinds of conversations and collaborations that 
are needed for good affinage. A cheesemaker’s style informs the type of affinage collaboration possible. 
0 27 25 Art and cheese overlap in many ways. Several cheese producers and retailers, like Benton, produced 
sculpture and art before working with cheese as a medium, of sorts. Susan describes working with their first 
cheesemaker partners. Description of working with and learning from cheesemaker Peter Dixon, Parish Hill.

0 32 05 In our first year of production, thanks to our partnership with Parish Hill, CFC cheeses won awards 
from the American Cheese Society and the New York State Fair. This gave us a lot of credibility. [Award 
winning cheeses: “Vermont Herdsman,” First Place, American Cheese Society. “The Paymaster,” 3rd Place, 
American Cheese Society, and; “Special K,” Award of Excellence from the New York State Fair.] Once we 
won those awards we were off and running. It really helped us on the business-side of things with credibility. 
They’ve now shifted from seeking cheesemakers to having more people knocking on their door. 
0 33 11 Benton and Susan discuss the number of producers they currently work with, the diversity of cheeses 
under affinage for each producers range of cheeses, and the length of time it takes to conduct R&D. It takes 
roughly one year to determine whether or not a cheese will work in their caves and can go into production.  
0 34 11 Benton describes a typical week at Crown Finish Caves. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are affinage 
days. They’re highly active cave days. Tuesday is the cheese receiving day. We process, weigh and put new 
cheeses in the caves and we pull cheese out of the caves for delivery on Wednesday. On Wednesdays, all 
cheeses get picked up for delivery to retailers but it’s also a light affinage day. Thursday is only cleaning. 
There’s no affinage, no packing up orders, only cleaning. We call it “The Big Clean.” All the coats get washed, 
the boots get sanitized. Friday it’s affinage.  
0 37 05 Benton explains in detail what’s involved in receiving and processing cheese several thousand pounds 
of cheese each Tuesday. 
0 39 23 Susan explains how affinage distinguishes cheeses, why CFC’s cheeses are co-branded, and as an 
affinage, how CFC has evolved from reproducing creameries’ styles of affinage for different sales territories 
to producing entirely distinctive cheeses with distinct CFC names. 
0 42 00 Susan describes the official CFC plant opening (licensing), May 2014. 
0 42 46 Susan and Benton offer a quick description of their marriage and business partnership. It requires the 
unique temperaments that can appreciate deep and constant layers of connection. Susan and Benton have 
been married since 2001. 
0 44 43 Susan describes her work prior to purchasing their properties. She worked for Transportation 
Alternatives promoting urban biking and walking, indoor bike parking, green building, and green roofs. She 
incorporated this sustainability ethic into the rehabilitation of their commercial buildings, which now feature 
radiant heating and recycled content. 
0 46 08 Benton had a welding, construction, carpentry, and sculpture background prior to becoming an 
affineur which meant he was the executor of the work. He and Susan formed a general contracting company 
when they purchased the buildings. 
0 47 34 Benton describes their co-workers. They’ve transitioned some of the Big Sue team into the cheese 
company [Big Sue is the name of their residential and commercial real estate company].  
August, Big Sue’s freight elevator operator and maintenance man now cares for cheese. Benton: I’ve got him 
washing, flipping, brushing and doing a fair amount of technical cave cleaning. I sent him to a HACCP 
[Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points] training course through Cornell so it’s been rebirth of his job 
description. 
They discuss Sam, a young cheesemaker who completed an apprenticeship with one of their partner 
creameries. He came to CFC to learn the affinage end of cheesemaking. He has excelled. He now manages 
the cave. Benton: he’s my point person for what’s happening and says, let’s taste this. He asks, where we 
should take this cheese? Should this one go longer? Go shorter? Should we move a cheese to a different part 
of cave? He pays attention to how much space we have left and decides how many boards we need.

Chelsea and Julia are two other CFC employees. They work in sales. They’re exposed to affinage to the extent 
that every CFC employee visits producers to put a face to the products.  
Susan works upstairs in the office (handling the work required for their residential and commercial tenants, 
the administrative and financial components of CFC, and child care. Benton, Susan, and their children live in 
an apartment in their residential building.]  
Benton is everywhere. I’m the conductor, the orchestrator.  
0 51 05 Benton discusses the financial risks of the affinage business. Affinage involves a lot of money. You’re 
sitting on thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars worth of cheese. So you want to make sure 
everything is running right. There’s a risk you could loose it all if something fails or you have an issue with an 
inspector, we monitor pathogens regularly and keeping a record of everything for our safety program.  
0 51 53 CFC’s safety program with the entire work team is discussed. 
0 52 01 Affinage work as a mentality. An affineur isn’t made from reading a book or memorizing facts. It’s a 
frame of mind and awareness of one’s body, one’s movements…Doing this work is just awareness. 
0 53 04 Susan describes needling, a verb and a tool, used to activate blue mold in blue cheese.  
0 53 57 Susan lists some affinage-specific terminology. Affinage itself is a peculiar word in the US. 
0 55 12 On their daughter’s interest in affinage because it’s sensory, it has a sort of inherent appeal to 
children.  
0 56 02  I look for guidance from others—Mateo Kehler and Hervé Mons. When they come to visit, I really 
listen. When they say, ‘It smells right in here,’ I remember that smell.  
0 56 48 Susan describes her feeling of gratitude of working in this field of affinage and cheesemaking with 
Benton. It’s introduced us to a lot of great people in the cheese world—producers, retailers, teachers.   
0 57 41 Benton: I will say this work is so much more complex than I ever anticipated. Not that I thought it’d 
be a walk in the park, but there are so many levels of the business that the weeks are flying by. I’m growing 
old very fast with this existence. But we’re making good growth moves. We’re on the right track.
