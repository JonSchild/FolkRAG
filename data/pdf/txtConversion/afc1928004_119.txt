BILLY GRIMES THE ROVER. 
To-morrow morn, I'm sweet sixteen, and Billy Grimes, the rover, 
lies popp'd the question to my mamma,and wants to be my lover, 
To-morrow morn he says, mamma, he's coining briolit and early, 
To take a 
pleasant trip with me, across the fields of barley 
You must not go, my daughter dear, it is no use a 
talking, 
You must not go across the field, with Billy Grimes a 
Nvalking ; 
To think of his presumption now, the dirty, ugly drover, 
I 
wonder where your pride is gone, to think of such a 
rover. 
Old Grimes is dead you know, mamma, and Billy is so lonely, 
Besides they say, too. Grimes has said, that Billy is the only. 
So I'll be heir to all he's left, and that they say is nearly 
A 
good ten thousand dollars worth,and about six hundred yearly. 
I 
did not hear,my daughter dear,your last remark quite clearly, 
But Billy is a 
clever lad, and no doubt loves you dearly. 
Be ready then, to-morrow morn, and be up bright and early, 
To take a 
pleasant walk with him across the fields of barley. 
And when we'er married, dear mamma, we both shall look so 
neatly, 
I'll wear a 
thousand dollar shawlAwill make me look so sweetly ; 
Tiiis common frock is getting old, and silks will soon be fashion, 
ni turn his pockets inside out, and meet with a 
short, I 
guess 
him. 
I STOOD BY THE SHORE. 
I 
stood by the shore, 'mid a 
weeping and wailing, 
Of friends that were parting, it might be for days; 
They gave a 
loud cheer when the good ship was sailing, 
And wept while the echoes were dying away. 
One bright face was laughing, while tears chased each other, 
It was but an infant whose smile I 
saw there : 
The babe had its home on the breast of its mother, 
But little it knew of its mother's despair. 
That morn to the wars, went the husband and father; 
The tears of the mother fell fast on the child. 
I 
wept, for the drops in my own eyes would gather ; 
I 
spoke, and the infant look'd upward and smiled. 
I 
talked of old homes, and the deeds of proud story ; 
-The wife thought of battles that yet were to come; 
I 
said in my mind, they who fight for our glory, 
Shall never have fear for the loved ones at home. 
Ii 
And spoke not I 
the truth, where's the freeman who'd falter, 
To bear out a 
promise a 
nation has made ? 
If dear to our hearts are our homes and our altars, 
Then those that defend them shall not lose our aid. 
Humanity needs it, her feelings are holy, 
And justice demands that each man plays his part; 
We may not all fight, still the ttigh and the lowly, 
Like freemen can aid in he cause we've at heart, 
FIGHTING FOR IRELAND. 
AIR—" Marching through Georgia." 
A song for poor old Ireland, boys, you'll say is just the thing, 
Freedom is the chorus and you all must join to sing, 
Confusion to her tyrant, let itle a 
queen or king, 
While we are fighting for Ireland. 
CHORUS. 
Huzza! hurrah, we fight for victory, 
Huzza I 
hurrah, old Ireland shall be free, 
We'll hoist the Harp and Shamrock 
On our island in the sea, 
Fight for freedom and Ireland ! 
The red flag of old England will be trampled in the dust, 
Anti while we battle with the foe, in God we place our trust, 
He will aid old Erin, for He knows our cause is just, 
Whet, we are fighting for Ireland. 
Huzza! hurrah I 
we fight, & c. 
We strike to free our country and we'll grasp it from the foe, 
And England with her unjust laws will be her overthrow ; 
Alt I 
the time is nearly here when she will feel the blow, 
And we'll be fighting for Ireland. 
Huzza I hurrah, we fight, (I:c. 
Cast aside your scruples now, the issue must be met, 
And our tyrant rulers soon will have cause for regret, 
Men fighting for freedom were seldom beaten yet, 
Hurrah, then, for liberty and Ireland I 
Huzza! hurrah, we fight, dm 
One effort for the mstery and we shall gain the day, 
I 
line do tv n 
all foes of freedom you see standing in the way, 
Tie vaunted power of England is hastening to decay. 
Let's strike, then, for liberty and Ireland 
Huzzal hurrah, we fight, drc. 
The tyrant shall receive a 
cheek he's never felt before, 
Am! the Euglish Lion soon will give his final roar, 
Tnen ilie shouts of victory will rim* from shore to shore, 
When we've won freedom for Ireland. 
Huzza I 
hurrah, we fight, & c. 
TEE MEDICAL STUDENT,. 
So Miss Edwards is going to marry, 
And they say '
tis a 
capital match; 
But 1 
know quite enough of the parties. 
To affirm it not lunch of a 
catch. 
They say he's a 
medical man, 
(Ilov people their friends will miscall DI 
For as yet he is only a 
student, 
And has patad neither college nor hall r 
Yes, indeed, he's a 
medical" student, 
And he wears such a 
horrid rough coat, 
Fitteet up with those ugly wood buttons, 
Which he fastens quite up to his throat; 
Then his hat cost about four and nine, 
With a 
brim very broad and quite flat, 
:'Tis a 
pity that medical students 
Have Rich Love for a 
gossamer hat.. 
Yes, indeed he's a 
medical studest, 
And because his last bills are not paid,. 
His credit is gone for the future, 
So he bays all his boots ready made 
They are Bluchers, and rather square-toed'. 
Which ill with the fashion aceords, 
But they do. fpr a

'MEDICAL STUDENT. ( CoNcLunEn.) 
In the class he but seldom is seen, 
And at those who attend he will laugh, 
Tis a 
pity that medical students 
Drink so much of that vile half-and-ba1L 
And if he attends any lectures, 
It is`ut because he's inclined, 
33ut he shows himself ,(once in a 
fortnight) 
Just to get his certificate signed. 
.He says he's well up in his Latin, 
Both t 
Celsus.and Gregory too, 
33nt I'm sure he's a 
little too certain, 
And I 
don't much think he'll get through. 
He goes np to the hall in the summer 
And so he's beginning to read, 
Mut he.don't like his practice -of-physic, 
And thinks botany turablig indeed: 
He says the old .saying's quite just, 
Which most of you doubtless have known, 
'That hydrogen means gin and water 
And oxygen pure gin alonel 
And when be has passed ail his -troubles, 
He still from his lady must roam, 
For you know 'tis a 
horrid profession, 
And yon can't catch an instant at home;

You will never repent of the plar

PADDY'S LAND. 
FALSE AMELIA. 
tilind friends, your sympathy pray give, 
To one who's broken hearted, 
truly I 
don't care to live, 
Since me and my girl's parted ; 
Amelia was a 
nice young girl, 
None with her could compare, 
The had dark blue eyes and pearly teeth, 
And glossy let black hair. 
-atrs.—For once sweet Amelia was always my pride, 
I 
now wish I 
never had seen her, 
She has wounded my feelings and thrown me aside 
For a 
dashing young Coinic Singer. 
Now if you'll 
list my friends, 
tell you all, 
How I 
lost my little dear, 
I 
took her to a 
Music Hall, 
Not very far from here, 
1Ve were happy till a 
young man came, 
Who seem'd so full of fun, 
He sang a 
song with a 
break-law name, 
And Amelia's heart he won. 
-,,ken.—How cruel. [For once, etc. 
Now he sang his songs in such a 
style. 
That kept u, all in roars, 
And frequently would Amelia smile, 
And give him great applause ; 
But the thin ," 
that put Toe in a 
rage, 
I 
oft think of now in pain, 
he'd wink at my love while on the Stage, 
And she'd wink back again. 
r7oken.—Yes she would. [For once, .17e.. 
Now when lie snag three songs, 
This comic " Pro" came, and at our table sat, 
So of course I 
quickly let him know,  
That I 
was IVA 
a flat ; 
But when he found Amelia took his part, 
Of course high words arose, 
He shot out his fist. like a 
dart, 
And hit me on the nose. 
Spokert—Which I 
did not relish. [For once, & 
But I 
returned the blow, and with such force 
That knocked him off his feet, 
But of course the waiters took his part, 
And kicked me into the street ; 
And it is about three months ago, 
And as yet I 
have not seen, 
AnVIlling of that comic " Pro," 
Or false Amelia Green. [ For once, ttc, 
Composed by JOHNNY ROACH. 
Come all ye boys of Paddy's land, who are inclined to r, 
To reap the English harvest so far away from home, 
Be sure yetere well provided with comrades bold and trre 
For you have to fight both day and night, 'gainst John 1.711.i ;.;: u 
his crew. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah, my boys, for Paddy's land, 
"rig the land I 
do adore, 
May heaven smile on every child 
that loves that shamrock shore. 
When we left home for Dublin, the morning it being c! , 
And when we got on board the boat, we gave thr 
cheers, 
Saying: Good-bye, my boys, to that dear old land, v.. 
may see it more, 
For we're going to fight, both day and night, all for 
rock shore. 
Then hurrah, my boys, 
'We sailed away from Dublin Quay, and ne'er receive(' 
Until we landed in New York, long side of the dock, 
Where thousands of our countrymen they were all in II, 
And " Fagh a

Then hurrah, my boys, 
Then away we went in merriment to drink bourbon a, 
Each lad he gave his favorite toast for the girl he

Or any man that hates the land, where St. Patrick's s

HAVE YOU SEEN DIY SARAH ? 
Written by GEORGE HERBERT. 
I 
mat a 
charming creature yes, 
In the Strand the other night, 
She glanced at me with charming 
Oh dear me, what delight. 
For her I 
began to sigh, 
I 
thought no one was fairer, 
And she plainly told me that 
Her name was Angelina Sarah. 
eye. 
Spoken.—Yes I 
admired that fair creature at first sight, she 
was gazing intently on a 
fashionable bonnet in a 
Milliner s 
window, I 
strolled carelessly up to her, and said " That's a 
very 
pretty bonnet, Miss—of course she answer'd yes ; I 
said would 
you like it; she answered yes, of course, no woman ever said 
no to a 
bonnet. 
I 
bought it, she wore it for the night, and— 
CHORUS. 
You ought to see my Sarah, 
Sarah, Sarah; 
You ought to see my Sarah. 
For a 
nice young girl is she. 
I 
asked if she was single, 
She quickly answered, yes ; 
She looked just like an angel, 
As her neck I 
did caress.

NAVE YOU SEEN MY SARAH? [coNcLuntn.] 
14 love began to kindle, 
When I 
kissed that fair girl's .
cheek, 
She promised for to meet me, 
This time next Tuesday week. 
You ought to see, drn. 
'When the day arrived to meet her, 
1 
To the spot I 
soon did tear; 
But think of my surprise, 
No Sarah had been there. 
I 
waited for one hour, 
But my deceiver did not come; 
-Oh ! I 
tore my hair and swore 
That I'd been most muelly done. 
Spoken — All that blow nearly broke my heart. 
Sarah the 
one for whom I 
only cared, cruelly deceived me, oh, you women 
what will you have to answer for ? but try and make amends 
by telling me this— 
'Oh, have you seen, &c.. 
If there's any girl to-night, 
Would like me for a 
beau? 
I'll do my best to please her, 
I 
can stitch, and I 
can sew. 
If any girl here wouhl like 
To settle down Tor Me, 
Let her step up on this platform, 
And make me a 
charming wife, 
Silnken. — Now, my dear girls, I 
sum going, going to the first 
bidder, don't be backward, there's dear girls, and if any of you 
will be ney partner, why I'll promise you— 
I'll never more see, dx.

Joe. 
When I 
was only ten years old, I've heard my mother say, 
When I 
was quite a 
baby, I'd such a 
taking way, 
And when I 
was only twelve years old, a 
queer complaint I 
bad, 
They called it kleptomania, and I 
had it very bad; 
The old folks tried their best this ere complaint to cure, 
But no, 'twas all in vain, break out 'twas certain sure, 
But picking oakum cured me, lor' I 
didn't feel the same, 
So I 
turned my pretty talents to a 
different sort of game. 
(Jerks his right thumb over his left shoulder.) 
I 
can do a 
little shuffle, itc. 
I 
can't stand those guns what does the prigging line, 
A 
man what isn't honest he's not a 
pal o' mine; 
For I 
once went on a 
visit to that crib at Holloway, 
I 
didn't like the treatment, so found it didn't pay; 
So now I 
goes to races, I'm known at all the fairs, 
I 
does the country yokels, before they is awares, 
The fakement with the three cards brings the mopesscs about, 
(Winking) My coveys, I 
find honesty the best of games what's out.

JUDY IlicCAZTY. 
A 
Come all my hearty roving blades, 
Some fun you are expecting, 
And I 
will prove without any noise, 
That I 
am not neglecting. 
You've heard the song ot Biddy McGee, 
And how she coaxed poor Paddy, 
Bit another one you'll get from me, 
About charming Judy McCarty. 
Whack fal la, etc. 
At Donnybrook fair I 
met her, 
Along with Michael McCarty, 
He handled her into a 
s 
at with care, 
Then soon I 
followed after. 
I 
asked her up to have ajig, 
She danced it neat and hearty; 
It was then with love I 
felt quite big, 
For charming Judy McCarty. 
W hack fal la, etc. 
I 
asked her woild she be my wife, 
Or, would she be my darling, 
The best of husbands I 
would make, 
And plaze her night and morning ; 
She said she would. and glad she was 
I 
took her from the party. 
That night was spent in devilment. 
Hugging Judy McCarty. 
Whack fa In, etc. 
To go home then we did prepare, 
We 
jogged it all the way, sir, 
We slept together that vroy night 
Until the break of day, sir. 
Next morning to the priest we went, 
Who tied us nate and hearty; 
That night was spent in devilment, 
Hugging Judy McCarty. 
Whack fal la, etc. 
Twelve months after we were wed, 
What do you think she brought. sir, 
But a 
pair of twins as like their dad 
As ever soup's like broth, sir. 
And now 
finish my little song, 
My song so gay and hearty, 
The Irish boys such devils are 
For getting the Young McCarty S.

IRISHMEN ARE NOT AFRAID TO FIGHT. 
Ant :—" Caroline of Edinburg town." 
Old England oft has boasted of her valiant fighting men, 
That when they met their enemies they beat them o'er again ; 
But still she calls on Irish boys whene'er she's in a 
plight, 
For Irishmen, she's well aware, are not afraid to fight. 
When in the Revolution of blest America, 
The patriots fought for their homes and England lost her 
sway; 
The rising of the Colonies gave Johnny Bull a 
fright, 
He loudly called on Irishman to aid him in the fight. 
And in the year of Eighteen Twelve, America once more 
Gave Britain such another scare, the Lion he did roar ; 
Says Johnny Bull, " I 
am not sure who's in the wrong or 
rght, 
But, Erin's Sons, I 
call on you to help me in the fight." 
And when the Indian Sepoys spread desolation o'er, 
Then England in her trials call'd on Irishmen once more 
The dusky rascals conquered were, and scattered left and 
r1 4 
lit, 
For Irishmen, as usual, were foremost in the fight. 
IRISHMEN NOT AFRAID TO FIGHT. [CONCLUDED. 
And when the growl of Russia's Bear was borne upon the air, 
And for the British Lion not a 
penny seemed to care; 
Says Johnny Bull, " I 
am not scared, I'll soon put him to 
flight, 
For haven't I 
got jolly Irish boys, who ne'er refussd to fight ? ' 
Then when in Abyssinia the campaign had begun, 
Old England sent an army out with cannon, sword and gun 
The dusky monarch Theodore was soon put out of sight, 
For, to his cost, the Irish boys were foremost in that fight. 
Old England in her hour of need, whenever it has been, 
Has ever placed her greatest trust in boys who wear the 
green ; 
Although she does, in time of pence, treat Ireland with a 
She knows too well that Irishmen arc not afraid to fight. 
Now It-t 
the tyrant warning take if he would keep his throne, 
Nor dare resist the Irish boys whose valor he has known ; 
For Ireland must and shall be free, each son will show his 
mi ght, 
And when the hour has come you'll find each Irishman will 
fight.

In troth, ma'am, she's left me, and I'll never be a

Not a

Since Molly she has left me all alone for to die. 
Och, boo, leagli 
Oh, the place where my heart was you could aisy roll a

As big as any pavin'-stone, from Dublin to the Devil's Glen,

again, 
And not left me here all alone for to die.

Oh, well do I remember when the winter time was past and 
gone, 
We wandered in the meadow on a 
bright, sunny summer morn , 
I 
was the only man she ever loved, she'd solemnly and truly 
sworn, 
But for all that she left me alone for to die. 
Och, boo leagh 
Then returning home at night, all in the rain and thunder

I 
wrapped her in my frieze coat, for the devil a waist-coat I

But for all that she left me alone to die.

Must I

PADDY'S LAMENT. 
Och hone, and alas I 
for the sons ot ' d 
Erin, 
Long will they rue the unfortunate t, 
They took lave of their butthermilk, pea.. - and herrirl, 
And all to sup sorrow across the salt say. 
Sore it was our intuition to rule the poor craythurs, 
And tactile them to live in respectable style, 
But there's so little 8.11S0 in their baythenish authors, 
The divil a 
thank do we get for our toil. 
Them Know-Nothing chaps have upset all our labors, 
Wid the stupid consate that the country's their own— 
They think they can role it thimselves, hut, be jabers, 
They aren t 
more fit than the man ilk the moon. 
But little I 
dratned we'd be licked by such ninnies, 
En spite of the Murphys, O'Tooles and O'Moores, 
O'Rafferties, Phalons, Oltuorlies and McKirmies, 
That was naturalized by the court in galores. 
'Twas toesilf that %Vas placed by the holes in the windy, 
To see that the boys did not vote the wrong way— 
And ve'd better belave we'd kicked up a 
shindy, 
If we'd seen the laste chance of losing the day. 
Each broth of a 
boy had as clean ii shillelah 
As iver cracked nitts on a 
Know-Nothing's pate--
And the natives looked blue as we flourished them gaily, 
And yelled ourselves bourse for our bold candidate. 
Tis a 
mortherit0 shame how our party was chated 
By the imp they called Sam with his beggarly crew, 
Anil thin not contint that our boys were defeated, 
By their villainous tricks they insulted us too. 
Sure the country's undone, whin the likes of sic!' fellers, 
Are sint to make laws agio whiskey, forsooth ! 
Of our superior janius its plain they are jealous, 
The ignorant boobies—and that's jist the truth. 
Bad luck has come oy-er the sons of ould Erin, 
It's long they'll repent the unfortunate day 
They left their swat; botthernailk, prati,s and herein', 
To govern the haythin ayont the salt say. 
ALICE WHERE ART THOU. 
The birds sleeping gently, 
Sweet Lyra ,gleameth bright, 
Her rays tinge the forest, 
And all seems glad to night, 
The winds sighing by roe, 
Cooling my fever'd brow, 
The stream flows as ever, 
Yet Alice where art thou 
One year back this even, 
And thou wert by my side; 
And thou wert by my side, 
Vowing to love me, 
One year past this even, 
And thou wert by my side; 
Vowing to love me, Alice, 
'What e'er might betide. 
The silver rain falling, 
Just as it falleth now; 
And all things sleeping gently, 
Ah 1 
Alice, where art thou I 
I've sought thee by lakelet, 
I've sought thee on the hill, 
And irk the pleasant wildwood, 
When winds blow cold and chill; 
I've sought thee in forest, 
I'm looking heav'nward now; 
Pm looking heav'nward now 
Oh ! there, mid the starshine, 
I've sought thee in forest, 
I'm looking heav'nward 
Oh I 
there amid the atarshine, 
Alice, I 
know art thou.

And ye, beautiful sounds, borne to me, how ye charm I

THE DREAM OF LOVE. 
Composed by G. 
HERBERT HOTWELL 
The dream of love ! the sweetest dream, 
That e'er can haunt the midnight hour, 
The young maid's hope, the poet's theme, 
The sleeper's bliss, the tangle pow'r. 
Which to the very soul imparts, 
A 
thrill forgotten never more; 
For oh, it brings to youthful hearts, 
A feeling they ne'er felt before. 
Then of all dreams from henv'n above, 
Give me the dream, the dream of love. 
The dreams of love the dreams of love, 
Give me the dream, the dreams of love. 
And that sweet &earn was mine to- night; 
When, oh, bow kind he look'd, then sigled 
And vow'd ' my eyes as stars were bright," 
And how 
1 soon should be his bride." 
But then it seemed be false became, 
And I 
was scorned, and loved no more— 
But why still weep my fancle0 shame ?— 
The wrong is gone, the dream once o'er. 
Then of all dreams from heav'n above, tte.

THE IRISH GIRL. 
One evening, as I 
stray'd down the river's side, 
Looking all around me as an Irish girl I 
spied, 
So rod and cosy were her cheeks, and yellow was her hair, 
And costly were the robes which my Irish girl did wear. 
Her shoes of Spanish leather were bound round with spat glen 
gay. 
The tears came down her crystal eyes, and she began to say 
'Deb, hone, and alas ! astore areen tnachree. 
Wiry should you go and leave me, and slight your own Molly ? 
The first time that I 
se .ny love, I 
was sick and very had, 
All the request I 
ask , was that she might tie my head 
I 
asked her if on 
bad as me could ever mend again I 
For love's a 
sore disorder—did you ever feel the pain? 
My love, she'll not come nigh t»e for all the moan I 
make, 
Nor neither will she pity me if my poor heart should break. 
But was I 
of sonic noble blood and she of low degree, 
She would hear my lamentation, and come and pity me. 
My only love ia fairer than the lilies that do grow, 
She has a 
voice that's clearer than any winds that blow; 
She's the promise of this country, like Venus in the air, 
And let her go where'er she will, she's my joy and only dear. 
Be it so, or be it not, of her I 
take my chance, 
The first time that. I 
saw my love, she struck me in a 
trance. 
Her ruby lips and sparkli. ; eyes have so bewitched me, 
That, was I 
king of Irelaud queen of it. she should be.

THE PILOT. 
Oh I 
Pilot ! 'tis a 
fearful night, 
There's danger in the deep ; 
I'll come and pace the deck with thee, 
I 
do not dare to sleep. 
Go down! the sailor cried, go down, 
This is no place for thee: 
Fear not! but trust in Providence, 
Wherever thou may'st be. 
Ah! pilot, dangers often met, 
We all are apt to slight, 
And thou hat known these raging waves, 
But to subdue their might; 
It is not apathy he cried, 
That gives this strength to me. [Fear not. & c. 
On such a 
night, the sea engulph'd, 
My father's lifeless form; 
My only brother's boat went down, 
In just so wild a 
storm; 
And such, perhaps, may be my fate, 
But still 1 
say to thee. [Fear not, &c.

SWEET KITTY NEIL. 
Words by J. V W ALLER 
Alt, sweet Kitty Neil, rise up from your wheel, 
Your neat little foot will be weary of spinning, 
cone, trip down with me to the sycamore tree; 
Half the parish is there and the dance is beginning. 
The sun has gone down, but the full harvest moon 
Shines sweetly and cool on the dew- whitened valley ; 
While all the air rines with the soft, loving things, 
Each little bird sh.gs in the green shaded valley. 
Each little bird sings in the green shaded valley. 
'With a 
blush and a 
smile, Kitty rose up the while, 
Her eye in the glass, as she bound her hair, glancing; 
'Tis hard, to refuse when a 
young lover sues, 
So she could not choose but go off to the dancing. 
Anil now on the green the glad troops are seen, 
Each gay-hearted lad with the lass of his choosing, 
And Pat, without fail, led out sweet Kitty Neil; 
somehow when he asked, she neler thought of refusing, 
Somehow when he asked, she ne'er thought of refusing. 
OH, NO, SWEET MAID, WE NE'ER MUST PART 
Oh, no, sweet maid, we ne'er must part, 
I 
cannot thee resign— 
I

Can dwell with none but thine ; 
Look on me with your loving eyes, 
Those beauteous orbs so bright 
There's nought can charm away my sighs 
But their entrancing light.

Nor let me sigh in vain; 
fle thou can St my spirits heal

MY GOOD OLD IRISH HOME. 
A IR :—" 
Ary old Kentuelcy Home." 
Och, my heart still yearns for my good old Irish home, 
Through grieving may be all in vain, 
Bad luck till the day -that I 
ever thought to roam, 
By the powers he brought in a 
dozen. 
What a 
daldum they'd have knocked us in, 
If I 
hadn't 'ave had this Darling Old Stick 
War ! was the word, when a 
faction came in, 
For they pummelled me well—they stripped off to the skin 1, 
Like a 
rector 1 
stood, watching the attack, 
And the first one came up I 
knocked on his back I 
Then I 
poked out the eye of Pat Glancy, 
For he once humbuged my sister Nancy I 
In the meantime Miss Kate took a 
fancy 
To me and my innocent Stick 
I 
smattered her sweetheart until he was black, 
Kate tipped me the %% ink we were off in a 
thwack I 
We went till a 
house at the end of a 
town, 
Where we kept up our spirits by pouring some down 
There the whisky began for to warm her, 
I 
got her sung up in a 
come:. ; 
She said her swee: heart would inform on her I 
Twits there I 
said praise to my stick I 
tj 
MY GOOD OLD IRISH HOME. [CONCLUDE -b. 
Kate she drank whisky to such a 
degree 
That for her support she had to lean upon me; 
I 
said I 
would see her safe till her abode 
'Tis there that we fell in the middle of the road. 
Until aroused by the magistrate's orders, 
Devil a 
toe could we go farther, 
Surrounded by policeman for murder, 
Was myself and my innocent Stick. 
When I 
was acquitted I 
jumped from the dock, 
An' all the gay fellers around me did flock ; 
The quarter I 
spint and with Larry I 
wint, 
To Oak street we traveled from Cherry, 
At aich shebeen we'd stop to take a 
small dhrop, 
Be the time we got there we wor merry. 
As the dure we passed through, what a 
sight met me view, 
All me powers of decription % would baffle, 
In a 
sorts of dress, full three hundred or less 
Wor at Micky Maginnis's raffle. 
The factions enraged, were in battle ingaged, 
An' the blood soon began to flow freely. 
But the whole iv the crew couldn't lather us two, 
Thot's meself an' me blackthorn shillely ; 
Me stick got excited it wanted to fight, it 
Longed to take part in the battle— 
It hit Shaughnessy 's Ted such a 
belt on the head, 
That it knocked him stone-blind at the raffle.

TEDDY O'NEAL. 
I 
dreamt but last night, oh, bad luck to my dreaming I 
I'd die if I 
thought 't 
would come truly to pass— 
I 
dreamt, as the tears down my pillow were stealing, 
That Teddy was courting another fair lass. 
Oh. didn't I 
wake with a 
weeping and wailing ! 
The thought of the grief was too deep to conceal. 
My mother cried, " Norah, chIld, what is your ailing?" 
But all I 
could utter was" Teddy O'Neal." 
I've been to the cabin he danced his wild jigs in, 
As nate a 
mud palace as ever was seen ; 
Although it did serve to keep poultry and pigs in 
I'm sure it was always most illegant clean. 
But now all about seems lonely and dreary; 
All sad, and all lonely, no piper, no reel, 
Not even the sun thro' the casement is cheery, 
Since 1 
left that dear darling, oh, Teddy O'Neal. 
Shall I 
ever forget when the big ship was ready? 
The moment had come when my love must depart; 
I 
cried like a 
spalpeen, " Good-bye to you, Teddy l" 
With drops on my cheek, and a 
stone at my heart. 
He said 'twas to better his fortune he's roaming, 
But what would be gold to the joy I 
should feel, 
If he'd only come back to me, honest and loving, 
Still poor, but my own dear Teddy O'Neal. 
I CAN BEAT HIM AT THAT. 
I've just made a 
promise to marry 
A 
youth who to home is inclined. 
And misunderstandings to parry, 
I 
now speak a 
bit of my mind. 
He musn't get cross or unruly, 
Bounce, swagger, or toss off his hat; 
If he does, I 
can tell him, and truly. 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that. 
CHORUS. 
If he does, I 
can tell him, and truly. 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that. 
He shall find that I 
will be respected, 
Have no matrimonial snubs, 
Nor stop at home, sad and neglected, 
While he's at hi i 
parties and clubs. 
As to friends, he may have them by dozens! 
But then, he must mind what he's at ; 
For, if be likes to flirt with his cousins, 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that. 
For, if he does, dr,c. 
I 
shall never be selfish or jealous, 
As many wives are, there's no doubt, 
But he musn't begin gallivanting, 
Or beauing young ladies about. 
My rights I 
shall prize pretty highly ; 
So tell him again, plain and flat, 
If he gives a 
kiss or two slily, 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that. 
For, if he does, die. 
But if he is happy and loving, 
Contented with me and his home, 
Affectionate, fond and approving, 
Nor ever seem wishful to roam. 
But each opportunity seizes 
To sit with me, ccanfort and chat, 
In short, be as kind as he pleases, 
He'll find I 
can beat him at that. 
For, if he does, drc.

Would you let him slide ? 
Or would you marry this dear one, 
I

He's such a

And that is what I'll do-
I 
pray you, &a. 
Sure, Terry O'Rielly, I've waited you know, 
And sure you're not coming, like my own thrue beau, 
I've looked through the windy till each little pane 
Is near hid by my tears like a 
shower of rain, 
Och, hone ! 
Terry, come soon ! 
Or else I'll get married some fine afternoon. 
Sweet Terry O'Rielly-, why keep me sighing, 
If I 
tarry longer, of grief I'll be dying, 
Now, Terry, pray baste, and this heart give relief, 
Or faith, my dear Terry, I'll soon die with grief. 
Och, hone I 
Terry, come soon ! 
Or else I'll get married some fine afternoon. 
Dear Terry O'Rielly I 
ne'er was a 
flirt. 
Still Terence is handsome and he'll gain my heart. 
Sure some one I 
must have, whose kindness will prove 
He's devoted to me, and faith him will I 
love. 
Och, hone I 
Terry, come soon I 
Or else I'll get married some fine afternoon. 
Now, Terry O'Rielly, I 
am tired of sighing, 
I'm tired to death, sure, with fretting and sighing, 
I'll marry to spite you, ma cushla, and part, 
With love for you, Terry, and so break my heart. 
Och, hone ! 
Terry, come soon I 
Or else I'll get married some fine afternoon.

Then, my boys, what can beat the music so sweet 
Of a 
pack of hounds in full ery; 
.Yoicks, tally ho 1 
away we go, 
Across the fields we fly; 
Into hedge and ditch sometimes we pitch.

And a

Some old farmers grunt, and oft cuss the hunt, 
And bar their gates up tight, 
But a 
drop of cogniac, from the rfon'rable Jack, 
Most always puts them right; 
But if that won't do, and they won't let us through, 
I 
call on my bonny old grey, 
Just tip her the word, and the clears like a

When the fox has gone away.

Then hurrah for the chase, the glorious chase, 
And may it for ever stand, 
As firm and strong, and last as long, 
As this old glorious land; 
And Old England's sons have many hard runs, 
And I 
hope for many a

The Iforerable Jack will be up with the pack, 
then the fox has gone away.

BELLE OF THE BALL.. 
THE BOYS OF KILKENNY. 
E'er of thee, my blue-eyed beauty, 
Constant, loving, fond and true; 
Surely, always, it's my duty, 
To think fondly, love, of you. 
While I 
read your loving letter, 
Happy thoughts run thro' my brain, 
Thinking- of a 
brighter future, 
And when we will meet again. 
Come at seven, Sunday evening, 
Please be prompt, make no delay;; 
Pa and Ma will go to meeting, 
And will be some time away. 
Just to-day, while on the Common, 
Startled by a 
female call, 
Turning 'round, I 
saw her coming,. 
The charmer I 
met at the ball. 
Smiling as she came up nearer, 
Blue eyes flashing with delight, 
Then she passed me with a 
whisper,. 
Don't forget next Sunday night. 
Then I 
watched her around the corner, 
Peeping from behind a 
tree, 
On the door which she did enter, 
Name and number I 
did see. 
I've received another letter, 
From this cliFiner of the ball, 
Something surely is the ma. 
ter, 
So I'll read it to you all. 
Sweet Alonzo, dearest darling, 
1 
nnt in an awful fright, 
By mistake I 
toid your rival, 
For to call next Sunda.; night_ 
Now I 
know that she's the flirting 
Coquette beauty or the hall, 
She is married 
five children, 
Now I 
don't think 1 
will call. 
Oh, the boys of Kilkenny are brave roaring blades, 
And if ever they meet with the nice little maids, 
They'll kiss them and coax them, and spend their money free. 
Of all the towns of Ireland, Kilkenny for me. 
In the town of Kilkenny there runs a 
clear stream, 
In the town of Kilkenny there lives a 
pretty (lame, 
Her lips are like roses and her mouth much the same, 
Like it dish of fresh strawberries smothered in cream. 
Her eyes are as black as Kilkenny's large coal, 
Which through my bosom has burnt a 
large hole, 
her mind, like its river, is mild, clear and Imre, 
But her heart is more hard than its marble, Um sure. 
Killiennv's a 
pretty town, and shines where it stands, 
And the more I 
think -of it the more my }wart warms, 
If I 
was at Kilkenny, I 
should then be at home, 
For there I 
got sweethearts, but here can get none. 
I'll build my love a 
castle on Kilkenny's free ground, 
Neither lards, dukes, nor squires, shall ever pull it down 
And if any one should ask you to tell him my name, 
I 
am an Irish exile and from Kilkenny I 
came. 
NELLY DARLING. 
The flowers are blooming, Nelly Darling, 
All (1 the birds are singing on each tree, 
Then come to your lover. Nelly Darling, 
My hive, you know, I'm waiting for thee, 
The sun is sweetly smiling, 
With his face so clear and so bright, 
Then haste to your lover, Nelly Darling, 
Ere the morning will change to night. 
Nelly, dear Nelly, 
Then haste to your lover, Nelly Darling, 
Em the morning will change to night. 
ileet me in the valley, Nelly Darling, 
Whet'' Ore moon shines over the sea— 
Then meet, me near the stream, Nelly 
And tales of love 111 tell unto thee. 
NV hen the twinkling stars are peeping, 
To rue your eyes shine more bright: 
Then meet me in the valley, Nelly Darling, 
And our vows of love we'll pledge to- night, 
Nelly, -dear Nelly, 
Then meet me in the valley, Nelly Darling, 
And our vows of love we'll pledge to-night.

WILL YOU LOVE ME THEN AS NOW 
You have told me that you love me, 
And your heart's thought seems to speak, 
As you look on me so fondly. 
And the life blood tints your cheek., 
May I 
trust that these warm feeling's, 
Never will grow cold and strange, 
And you'll remain unaller'd, 
In this weary world of change ? 
Whet the shades of care and sorrow, 
Dim my eyes and cloud my brow, 
And my spirit thinks within me, 
Will you love me then as now ? 
Though our youth may pass unclouded, 
In a 
peaceful happy home, 
Yet as year on year advances, 
Changes must upon us come. 
For, the step will loose its lightness, 
And the hair be changed to grey; 
Eyes once bright give up the lustre, 
And the hopes of youth decay. 
When all these have passed upon me, 
And stern age ha a 
passed my brow, 
Will the change find you unchanging, 
Will you love me then as now ?

WHY CAN'T PADDY BE A GENTLEMAN. 
Words by GEORGE COOPER. 
I 
was told that Pat couldn't be a 
gentleman ; so I've set myself 
the task, 
That I 
to-night the reason why—of you my friends would ask; 
Hasn't Ireland her colleges that have for centuries stood 
r1'0 teach the people? and you know, the teaching mighty good, 
Haven't Irishmen got heads and hearts? 
Bedad I 
know that's so ; 
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
Spoken.—I 
should like to see it denied. 
Look at the record 
and you'll never ask— 
CHORUS. 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman, a 
gentleman—a 
gentleman. 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman ? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
If Paddy's not a 
gentleman, I'd like to know who is? 
You cannot give a 
reason why—each manly trait is his; 
He's always first to help a 
friend, although his means are scant, 
And tho' he's fond of blarney, he hates deceit and cant. 
His coat may be of common frieze, his heart won't freeze, oh, 
no!
Then why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman ? 
That's what I 
want to know. 
Spoken— If you know, tell me— 
Why can't Paddy, & c. 
Just read the Irish history; and in that same you'll find 
Great deeds of Irish gentlemen ; St. Patrick's one, d'ye mind? 
If great deeds then, enoble men, ah, worrah sure, it's true, 
Pat shows as long a 
list, my boys, as any one can do. 
And don't forget this, ye who sneer at honest Paddy's worth, 
That actions make the gentleman no matter what the birth. 
Acpoken —
Sure, none of you can tell me— 
Why can't Paddy be a 
gentleman ? 
A gentleman, a 
gentleman ! 
Why can t 
Paddy be a 
gentleman ? 
That's what I

I WANT A BEAU. 
I 
want a 
beau, I 
want a 
beau! 
"I'is sweet ( at least they tell me soo 
To waltz, or walk, or sail, or row 
With him you mean to marry ; 
And then, you know, it must he sweet 
To have one kneeling at one's feet, 
And hear him, there, his vows repeat. 
Oh ! I 
should like to marry! 
I 
want a 
bean 
I 
know he loves me, and he came 
This very night to tell his flame, 
And called me a 
very pretty name, 
And asked me if I'd marry. 
I 
blushed as every modest maid 
On such occasion will— and said 
Oh, dear, I 
feel somewhat afraid, 
I 
am too young to marry. 
I

ASK ME NOT WHY. 
Ask me not why my heart with fond emotion, 
Beats for the brave companions of my youth, 
Had they not tended me with love's devotion, 
I 
had not lived, alas, to prove my truth; 
A helpless babe upon the field I 
lay, 
And but for them my life had pass'd away. 
Ere I 
foreet, then, all their loving kindness, 
Bring o'er my heart oblivion to the past ; 
But when you win for me that fatal blindness, 
In mercy let that moment, that moment be my last. 
Chide me no more, were I 'devoid of feeling, 
Would my ingratitude not wake thy feats? 
Worthless would be this moment's fond revealing, 
If I 
could cast aside the ties of long years. 
Thou bast my love; thine is a 
mother's claim, 
To them forget not that thou ow'st the name, 
My mother, my mother dear. 
Era I 
can cease to think of all their kindness, 
Brim.; o'er my Ite:trt oblivion of the past: 
But when you win for me that fatal blindness, 
In mercy let that moment, that moment be my last. 
IRELAND'S REDEMPTION. 
Ant t-- " Limerick Races." 
The people are around, all eager for the fight, sirs, 
Awaiting the great day, and the forth-coining Relit, sirs, 
tIark 
hark I ' tis Freedom's voice and Irishmen obey it., 
Our country must be freed, no longer we'll delay it. 
Then drink to Erin's cause 
And fill your glasses higher, 
Confusion to our foes, 
They soon will feel our fire. 
Our foes are getting wise, 
Politically scheming; 
We'll count it but as naught, 
They will not find us dreaming_ 
They've waited quite too long— 
Denied us all our rights, sirs.; 
No compromises now, 
For Irishmen means fight, sirs. 
Then here's to freedom's cause, 
May Ireland soon be free, sirs, 
And British rulers, knaves, 
e 
sent into the sea, sirs. 
They execute our men 
Who true in their desires, 
Fight for their native land, 
To emulate their sires. 
The day will surely come, 
When such deeds will be punished, 
Olt, grasping tyrant, pause, 
Quite oft we have admonished. 
Old Ireland shall be free, 
In 
spite of England's power, 
Then every Irishman 
Be ready at the hour. 
Let other nations see 
That we deserve our freedom ; 
Our men will not retreat, 
But follow where we lead theta. 
And when the foe is met, 
And should be make a 
stand, sirs, 
He'll find that Irish boys 
Strike with a 
heavy hand, 
Then toast our Island, boys, 
Old Ireland forever ; 
And haste the day when from 
Great Britain we shall sever.

And tell you about that gal who dresses so gay, 
In Central Park I

They say she is tire beauty of Broadway.

THE SONS OF FINGAL. 
Oh, Erin, my country, although thy harp slumbers, 
And lies in oblivion near Tara's old hall, 
With scarce one kind hand to enliven its numbers, 
Or strike a 
rude dirge to the Suns of Fingal. 
Thy trophies of warfare they still hang neglected, 
Cold to the warriors to whom they were known ; 
But the Harp of Old Erin shall still be respected, 
While there lives but one hard to enliven its tone. 
Oh, Erin, my country ; I 
love thy green bowers, 
No music to me like thy murmuring rills; 
The shamrock to ine is the fairest of flowers, 
And what is more dear than thy daisy-clad hills. 
The caves often used by warriors and sages 
Are still sacred held in an Irishman's heart, 
And the ivy-clad turrets, the pride of past ages, 
Tho' mouldering in ruins, still grandeur impart. 
Britannia may boast of her lion and armor, 
As she in glory her old wooden walls view; 
Caledonia may boast of her pibroch and claymore, 
And pride in her philibegs, kilts and her hose. 
But where is the nation can rival Old Erin, 
Or tell me a 
country who such heroes can boast; 
In battle they're brave as the tiger or lion, 
And swift as the eagle that flies round our coast. 
The breeze often shakes both the rose and the thistle, 
Whilst Erin's green shamrock lies husli'd in the vale; 
Securely it stands while the stormy winds whistle, 
And lies undisturbed in the moss of the vale. 
Then hail, fairest island of Neptune's old ocean, 
The land of St. Patrick, my parents, agra; 
Cold, cold. must the heart, be and void of emotion, 
That loves nut the music of Erin-go-bragli

WHEN JACK THE VESSEL LEAVES FOR SHORE. 
When Jack the vessel leaves for shore 
Paid off with guineas shining, 
The perils of the ocean o'er ; 
His arms round Poll entwining, 
He jains his messmzttes in the mirth, 
The brimming glass runs over, 
And many a 
tale the Landsman hears, 
Of what befals the rover. 
And if a 
poor old worn out Tar, 
For aid should be appealing, 
Jack ovehauls his locker soon, 
And hands the balm that's healing, 
No friend that's ever in distress, • 
By him is disregarded, 
And though he finds his pockets less, 
He feels at heart rewarded. 
I'VE WANDERED O'ER THE SEA, LOVE. 
I've wandered o'er the sea, love, 
I've wandered o'er the sea, 
And many a 
tempest braved, love, 
A thousand miles from thee; 
1 
never felt afraid, love, 
To act a 
sailor's part, 
Thy beauty nerved my arm, love, 
Thy promise cheered my heart. 
In many a 
happy dream, love, 
I've seen thy angel form, 
And rose with strength renewed, love, 
Alike for calm and storm. 
A 
guiding-star thou wert, love, 
O'er all the briny foam, 
A 
ray to cheer and brighten, 
The Sailor's pathway home. 
HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS AGAIN. 
Though to-day be gloomy seeming, 
And obscured the sun's bright ray, 
Soon his lustre will be beaming, 
All the clouds will pass away. 
So, however sad your lot be, 
Pre3sing hard on heart and brain, 
You may yet a 
brighter change see— 
Hope for better days again. 
Sit not down the whole day grieving. 
Life is worth a 
struggle still, 
Never cease to be believing, 
Much we CAN do if we will. 
So, however sad your lot be, 
Pressing bard on heart and brain, • 
You may yet a 
brighter change see— 
Hope for better days again.

TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
'Tis bard to lose one's lady love 
And coldly get the sack; 
'Tis hard to lend a 
pound or two 
And never get it back; 
'Tis hard when some relation dies 
And leaves a 
lengthy will, 
To find yourself put calmly down 
For just exactly nil. 
But follow my prescription, die 
It's anything but lively 
To be anything but well, 
When crowds of eager creditors 
Come tugging at your bell; 
And it's pleasant at a 
party when 
Your nerves are going wrong, 
To be asked " as quite a 
favor," for 
A 
screaming comic song. 
But follow my prescription, dr,c. 
It's awfully delightful to 
Be told you're getting stout, 
Or when you've got a 
toothache to 
Be urged to have it out, 
And when you take an omnibus 
It's more refreshing still, 
To find yourself at Highbury 
When bound for Notting IIill. 
But follow my prescription, dm. 
I've suffered many trials in 
The course of my career, 
And found it hard to see my way 
Particularly clear; 
But I've long ago discovered that 
The proper thing to do, 
Is to go and act precisely as 
I've recommended you. 
I 
take my own prescription as 
The only cure for care, 
And I 
find that all my troubles are 
But "trifles light as air." 
A flaxen-headed cow:1)0y, 
As simple as may be, 
And next, a 
merry plough-boy, 
1 
whistfd o 
er the lea. 
But now a 
saucy footman, 
I 
strut in worsted lace, 
And soon I'll be a 
butler, 
Ana wag my jolly face : 
When steward I'm promoted, 
I'll snip a 
tradesman's bill, 
My master's coffers empty, 
My pockets for to till ; 
When lolling in my chariot, 
So great a 
man I'll be— 
You'll forget the little plough-boy 
That whistled o'er the lea. 
I'll buy votes at elections, 
But when I've made the pelt, 
I'll stand poll for parliament, 
And thou vote in myself. 
Whatever's good for me, sir, 
I 
never will oppose, 
When all my ayes are sold off, 
Why then I'll sell my nose. 
I'll bawl, harangue, and paragraph, 
With speeches charm the ear, 
And when I'm tired on my logs. 
Then I'll sit down a 
peer. 
In court or city honors, 
So great a 
man I'll be, 
You'll forget the little plonglidioy 
That whistled o'er the lea.

WAKE US AT DAWN, MOTHER. 
How dear, oh ! how dear, were Our childhood's short hour; 
When the earth seemed a 
beautiful garden of flowers; 
And life glided on, like a 
clear- flowing stream, 
As calm and unruffled as purity's dream ; 
Then days went too swiftly, and at their close, 
Peaceful and happy, we sought our repose ; 
And said, " Dearest mother, we long for the morn, 
Wake us at dawn, mother, wake us at dawn," 
CHORUS. 
The days went too swiftly and at their close, 
Peaceful and happy, we sought oar repose; 
And said, '' Dearest mother, \re long for the morn, 
Wake us at dawn, mother, wake us at dawn." 
how sad do we grow, as time fleeting past, 
Recwis childhood's days, far too happy to last; 
And we sigh, as we think, with hearts full of pain, 
Of days that can never come over again. 
How often at dawn we are weary, awake, 
Oh, for the day when we wished it to break, 
And said, " Dearest mother, we long for the morn, 
Wake us at dawn, mother, wake us at dawn,', 
Then days went too, & c.

THE WIFE'S FAREWELL. 
You'll think of me, husband, when gone from your sight, 
When you never more see me, forget me not quite; 
You'll miss day and night, love, my soft loving tone, 
And your heart wring %s 
ith pain, love, when beitiug alone. 
You'll think of gone days, and grief may wring a 
tear, 
From those eyes that ne'er wept, but I 
shall not be here ; 
To your work you will go, husband, and the smile you oft met, 
Will be faded and fled, love, but, oh! don't forget. 
For your wife, dearest husband is passing away, 
And s 
aring to lands far above the sun's rays.; 
Oh, kiss me, dear children, and with me now pray 
For your mother is going to heaven to day. 
When cold is the form, love, that lies on thy breast, 
And chill is the lips that thine own oft have pressed; 
Oh, sometimes think of me, and come to the spot, 
Where I 
sleep all alone, love, but I 
hope not forgot. 
You'll think, too, when sitting in the vacant chair, 
And sometimes you'll gaze on that gold lock of hair 
And think that its curls were once on the brow, 
That lies in the grave, love, so cold and so low. 
Oh, what are poor children when parents are gone, 
Poor orphans they wander the wide world alone; 
And seldom they think of a 
kind mother's ‘vorth, 
Till to heaven she's departed, and leaves us on earth 
They then miss her care, and her fond leving voice 
And stray unprotected, to folly and vice ; 
From Ow care and trouble no mother to save, 
Till the uhildren at last be with her in the grave.

Loose, loose ev'ry sail to the breeze, 
The course of the vessel improve,

My mistress is constant and kind. 
My sails are all fill'd to my dear,

To the gale that may drive her along.

FAITHLESS EILIDLA. 
I 
wandered once at break of day, 
While yet upon the sunless sea, 
In wanton sighs the breeze delay'd, 
And o'er the wat'ry surface play'd. 
Then first the fairest face I 
knew, 
First loved the eyes of softest hue ; 
And ventur'd fearful first to sip 
The sweets that hung upon the lip 
Of faithless Emma. 
So mix'd the rose and lilies white, 
That seemed uncertain quite, 
To deck her cheek, what flower she chose, 
The lily, or the blushing rose. 
I 
wish I 
ne'er had seen her eye, 
Ne'ev seen her cheek of doubtful dye, 
And never, never dared to sip 
The sweets that hung upon the lip 
Of faithless Emma. 
For tho' from rosy dawn of day, 
I 
rove along and anxious pray, 
'Till night with curtains dark descend, 
And day no inure its gleaming lend ; 
Yet still no cheek like hers I 
find, 
Like hers no eye, save in my mind, 
Where still I 
fancy that I 
sip 
The sweets that hung upon the lip 
Of faithless Emma. 
LITTLE FOOLISH FLUTTERING THING. 
Say, little foolish, fluttering thing, 
Whither, ah ! 
whither would you wing 
Your airy flight, 
Stay here, and sing 
Your mistress to delight. 
No, no, no, _ 
Sweet Robin, you shall not go. 
Where, you wanton, could you be 
Half so happy as with me.

EVENING REPOSE. 
By PRINCE ALBERT. 
How calm and still around me 
Each object now remains; 
The hills that now surround me 
Are breathless as the plains. 
The verdant leaves so tender, 
Their slightest motion stop, 
Nor sighs to Zephyr render 
"Upon the mountain top. 
No twinkling star appearing, 
It's light o'er nature throws, 
All to my heart endearing. 
The evening's calm repose. 
BRANDY. 
Parody on " Old England forever," ea. 
Oh! Brandy, thy virtues they never will yield to 
Champagne or Madeira, or any such slop: 
And whilst I've a 
TANNER, I ever will reel to 
That mansion of comfort— the fam'd brandy shop. 
Once the measures were small, and we'd little for money, 
Yet the act soon pass'd over, ' twas an IMPERIAL start, 
Then get drunk and be jolly, for believe me, dear honey, 
'Tis brandy forever can cheer up the heart. 
Thy flavor nnmix'd, has long been my glory, 
No gin, rum, or bitters, with thee can compare; 
And whilst I've a 
quartern of brandy before me, 
For riches or honors not a 
fig do I 
care; 
For Oh I 
there's a 
spirit within thee contained, 
And life from this bosom more surely shall part, 
Then I 
leave the bottle un til it is drained, 
For brandy forever shall cheer up my heart. 
MY BABY BOY. 
0 I 
softly sleep, my baby boy, 
Rock'd by die mountain wind, 
Thou dreariest not of a 
lover false, 
Nor of a 
world unkind. 
0 I 
sweetly sleep, my baby boy, 
Thy mother guards thy rest, 
Thy fairy clasp, my little joy, 
Shall soothe her aching breast. 
Wake, wake and smile, my baby boy, 
My heavy heart to cheer: 
The winery blast howls on the hills, 
The leaf grows red and sear. 
Oh ! tell me, tell me, baby boy, 
How shall I 
bear die cry, 
When hunger gnaws thy little heart, 
And death lights on thine eye. 
Oh 1 
was it meet, my baby boy, 
That thou such weird should dree? 
Sweet Heav'n, forgive thy father false, 
His wrongs to thee and me.

THE FRIAR OF ORDERS GREY.; 
I 
am a 
Friar of orders grey, 
And down the valley I

I 
pull not blackberry, haw, or hip, 
Good store of venison fills my scrip; 
My long bead-roll I 
merrily chaunt, 
Where'er Lgo no money I 
want, 
And why I'm so plump, the reason I 
tell— 
Who leads a

What baron or squire,

After supper of heaven I

With old sack wine I'm lin'd within ;

THE LIGHT BARK. 
Off, said the stranger, off, off, and away, 
And away flew the light bark o'er the silvery bay ; 
We mast reach, ere to-morrow, the far distant wave, 
The billows we'll laugh at, the tempest we'll brave. 
The young roving lovers, their vows have been giv'n, 
And smiled o'er by mortals but hallow'd in heav'n, 
She was Italy's daughter, I 
knew by her eye; 
It wore the bright beam that illumines her sky. 
Off, &c. 
And she has forsaken her palace and halls, 
For the chill breeze and the light which falls 
O'er the pure wave, from the heavens above, 
And their guiding star was the bright star of love. 
Off, &c. 
THE MAID OF LANGOLLEN. 
Tho' lowly my lot, and tho' poor my estate, 
I 
see without envy the wealthy and great; 
Contented and proud a 
poor shepherd to be, 
While the maid of Langollen smiles sweetly on me. 
My way o'er the mountain I 
cheerfully take, 
At morn, when the song birds their melody make ; 
And at eve I 
return with a 
heart full of glee. 
For the maid of Langollen smiles sweetly on mc. 
Glenarvon's rich lord passes scornfully by; 
But wealth ne'er can make him so happy as I. 
And prouder than even the proudest I'll be, 
While the maid of Laugollen smiles sweetly on me. 
MY FATHER'S OLD FARM. 
Once more I 
return to my clear native home, 
And from the old farm, ne'er again will I 
roam ; 
Twas on this sweet spot, with the reapers so gay, 
When youth seemed as bright as the sun's golden ray 
'Twas here where my days of sweet infancy passed,. 
I 
timed not the hours, for they flew by so fast, 
Those days are now gone— and I 
feel not the joy. 
In viewing those scenes as I 
did whilst a 
boy. 
CHORUS. 
Though sad, sad the heart, yet life still has a 
charm, 
I 
feel as I 
gaze on my father's old farm. 
They bless'd me—I 
left—they bade me be sure, 
With honor return, or return home no more; 
Long years have roll'd by—thoughts of them and this spot, 
Though absent they were, oh, they were not forgot. 
So poor, poor I 
left them, one bright beaming morn, 
With riches returned—like the leaf, they were gone. 
'Twas here I 
was born—my life's early days spent— 
'Bs here I 
will die, where I 
lived with content. 
Though sad, &c. 
DO NOT MINGLE. 
Do not mingle one human feeling 
With these blisses o'er each sense 
While these tributes to me revealing, 
Elvino faithful to his love. 
Ah embrace me— while thus forgiving, 
Each a 
pardon thus receiving; 
On the earth, while we are living, 
We will form a 
heaven of love. 
59 
TIME IS A BLESSING: 
Oh l 
time is a 
blessing sent by God, 
For the use, not abuse, of man; 
And woe to him who shall ever presume, 
To frustrate his Maker's plan. 
The sun hat h 
its time of going down, 
The birds know their hour of rest; 
Then why is it that man should be, 
By his fellow man oppress'd ? 
By his fellow man oppress'd ? 
Oh, why should the hour of toil endure, 
Till the head and the heart grow faint ? 
Is it because the mind of man, 
Is better for such restraint ? 
Need leisure hours be idle hours, 
And tend to corrupt the mind ? 
No I 
brotherly love is the only chain, 
That master and man should bind, 
That master and man should bind. 
Go, ask ye of him whose sunken cheek, 
Proclaims a 
life of care, 
How many hours of the twenty-four, 
He for wife and child can spare ? 
Oh ! long ere he wearily seeks his home, 
His children are gone to rest; 
Little they know of a 
father's love, 
Or the anguish that rends his breast, 
Or the anguish that rends his breast. 
Who will not toil for those he loves ? 
But, alas! human nature is weak; 
And if time be not g
. 
iv'n for mental food, 
Some other resource man will seek ; 
At the hour of ten, at the closing hour. 
When the spirits require relief, 
He rushes to scenes where excitement dwells, 
To drown for a 
while his grief, 
To drown for a 
while his grief.

A tale of the wildest excitement, yet of the greatest

truthfulness. 
The narrative of two young girls that fell 
into the gore-stained clutches of some of the most ferocious 
pirates that ever cheated the yard-arm of its hanging fruit. 
The scenes are terribly thrilling—many positively appalling. 
Fortunately Providence sends an antidote for every bane. 
and the bloody heartless deeds of the ocean desperado-A-ar&j, 
neutralized by the heroic actions of some of the bravest tars • 
that ever shook out a 
reef or sighted a 
gun. , ...
