Bill Grumbles: Mr. Roosevelt, I sure hope you're getting along all right up there in Washington. I know
there's a whole lot going on up there these days and a lot of war activity and I reckon you're pretty
busy, but don't work yourself to death now. That won't do. A fella can just work so long that he plays
out and I'd sure to hate to hear about you playing out on us. Because we expecting a lot of you. I
know it's kind of riding a good horse a long way, but we are getting such good service out of you
[laughs].
Mr. Roosevelt, I do hope that your whole family is well too. I think a lot of them and what I heard of
them they seem like they're mighty fine folks and we're all for them down here. You know down here
in Travis County, I live here out here in Oak Hill and there's a whole lot of war activity out here. Just
a whole lot of it, going on all the time it seems like. We have a real good time watching these here
airships fly over and all that sort of thing. And it goes mighty well I tell you that much. We're proud
of our United States Army. The thing that I heard about with the most fun is that you sent down our
soldiers to ???. I was just itching to get some of our boys over there, Mr. Roosevelt and I think you did
just right.
Now, the Tracey boys and the Brown boys they have all gone over there, I think, I ain't sure. But we
ain't heard from them lately and if they are I sure pity old Hitler. I just tell my wife last night if [laughs]
they must lose the guns them boys take rocks and run them Germans plum off the end of the ocean
somewhere. Because you know them boys are death with rocks and they can knock a rattlesnakes
head off fifty foot off with a flint rock. I'd hate to be a German if they was to take after me [laughs].
So many folks around here Mr. Roosevelt thought that you was scared of old Hitler for the longest,
but course I never did. I always told them like this, I said “Why just like old hound dog was about the
pole cat.” He knows he supposed to shake the daylights out of him, but he just needs go in there and
grab him and get the stink all over him [laughs].
But I tell you, that ??? since we're in this here war I look at it this way, let's get hold of 'ol Hitler and
turn him every way but loose. Because I tell you this much about it Mr. Roosevelt, whether you know
it or not, he's the bottom of this whole thing. It's his stinking thinking that did the whole thing. And
it just makes me tired to think that we dilly dallied along with him so long and let him get away with
it. But we was easygoing wadn't we? We're just like that. We'll take a whole lot off a fellow before
we'll start something with him. But once we get it started we aim to finish it, don't we? You bet your

boots. . . . our Old ??? he was in the last war, he was from right out here in our precinct. And I know'd
him since he was a little 'ol boy never could read and write his name and then he went over there
and he liked to won that war single-handed. He said, “It ain't nothing to fight the Germans. It's just
catching them.” They're awful slick and you have to watch it because they bad about hiding from
you.” And I think you ought to send word to that there army that you got that we're going to have
that to cut up with. It's just a catching them that they going to have to worry about.
Of course, I never did do no warring myself Mr. Roosevelt. I ain't speaking firsthand, I ain't telling
you how to run this here war because I think you know more about it than I do. In fact, I feel sure
that you do. But I think that we ought to kind of surround them like. Come up on them from both
sides. They can't look two ways at once, that's a sure thing. And from what I know about them there
German army fellers, they don't look no way, but right straight at my eye. And I believe that we could
sneak up on them.
Course old Mussolini he ain't nothing. Our Lord have mercy you just stomp your foot at him. You tell
our soldiers, whoever you send down around Italy, just to stomp their foot at him and yell “whoop?”
at him like you do at a dog that's been barking at you. He'll run. Sure he will, he'll tuck his tail, run
right now. He's easy scared off. 'Cause there ain't nothing to him, he's just stuck around the back
door and wait for somebody to throw something out to him. Hell, there ain't nothing to him and we
come up through Italy — I guess you've seen a map of Europe — come up through Italy and then
wheel around and come in from the north up there through Sweden and Denmark, all up there. And
pull in on 'ol Hitler and then get around behind him, see, get around between him and Russian and
run him toward the sea. You could run him off in that there Atlantic Ocean. Sure you could and let
the British stand there and club him as he run the water.
That's a way you could do it. That's my idea. And I tell you this when these old Travis County boys
get up there let them do it. Let them do it. I've seen them, they was some smart-aleck fellas up
here at university, boys up here to picnic on Barton Creek showing out one time. Carrying on and a
hooraying and yelling and making fun of these Brown boys and Tracey boys and the Simpson boys.
They was all up there and swimming and those university boys are making fun of them and our boys
got out and picked up rocks and run them university boys ??? run them about three miles with rocks.
Sure did and they skinned some heads with them rocks. Well, they could do them Germans the same
way, just don't you worry. They will do it. You work on that scheme, that idea that I gave you. Course
now like I say, I ain't trying to run things for you because I believe you know how to do that far best,
but you just figure on that idea that I give you.

I want you to tell Mrs. Roosevelt “howdy” for me. And tell them all up there “howdy” and that we are
thinking about them down here. And that if there's anything we can do, call on us. We've been doing
it for the last hundred years down here in Texas and we're still raring to go. And good luck to you.
