I: 
[1.39.16] Okay. Just a few little instructions. I will tell you that we’re going to do this in three segments. 
They’re all about 20 minutes each. He’ll let us know when it’s time. It’s partly ‘cause it’s good to shift gears, get 
a little break, but also for him to change his batteries. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
You’re gonna tell us a bunch of stories. That’s what we want. We really are interested in the stories. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, this is an opportunity to talk about your work, what you do, but it’s so much better if instead of just 
saying, “Oh, yeah. I give ‘em a bath, and I give ‘em lunch, then I do this, then I do that.” If you can think of 
specific stories that illustrate what you do. 
P: 
Sure. 
I: 
And then, I guess the last thing I’ll say, is that I know you’re going to say a lotta things that I’m gonna 
wanna go, oh, wow. That is so cool or tell me more, you know. I’m gonna refrain because we want to hear your 
voice, not mine. 
P: 
[Laughs]. 
I: 
So, when you say something really cool, I might just go [must have been visual]. 
P: 
[Laughing] okay. 
I: 
Like that. 
P: 
All right. 
I: 
Okay. I’ll be excited inside. Do you have anything to add? 
I2: 
Just touching your scarf, so I’m gonna grab this and put it up here. 
I: 
Okay. I can take the scarf off. 
I2: 
No, no. The scarf looks awesome [1.37.46]. 
I: 
[Laughs] okay, ready? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
Okay. Let me start this. I’m not ready yet. Almost ready. Almost, almost, almost. Okay. I’m ready to go. 
I: 
All right. Here we are, and we are with WM. And I wanna first say thank you to you for the work that you 
do. We believe this work is really valuable, which is why we’re here because we want to hear your stories, and 
we want to share them with others so that other people know what it is you do, and how important it is. And so, 
thank you for agreeing to have this interview with us. 
P: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
I’m going to jump right in and just say, tell us your story. How did you get into this kind of work, when, 
why? 
P: 
Well, it’s an interesting story [laughs]. I got into this business because my mother had this business. 
She worked for years as a nurse with end-of-life, and she worked for home healthcare companies, and she 
saw a need in the community. She started the business. I had started—I mean I worked in automotive, and 
during the recession getting gainful employment from my last layoff was difficult. My mother proposed that I

Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18

come up to northern Michigan and help her in this business. Now, I’ve always respected her job as a nurse. 
I’ve always been interested in caring for people [1.35.43]. I personally didn’t go into nursing, but I had a lotta 
background knowledge just being around people in the health field. So, we moved up here, and we started with 
my mom’s business. And I started more interested in the business side because that was my background. That 
was where I felt comfortable. I felt comfortable with spreadsheets and, you know, billing, and things like that. 
And there came a need—we had a client that had fallen and broken his neck, and we went from just working a 
few hours a day to 24 hours, and mother was like, “I need you to work in the home.” I said, sure, no problem. 
And that’s how I kind of got my feet wet. And then, just with that knowledge, I wanted to learn more about 
proper procedures, things like that. My mother was very good—instrumental at showing me and teaching me 
and training me on, you know, the neck brace, things like that, managing, shower chairs, all that. And the funny 
situation is this client was—well, he had Alzheimer’s, but he was what I’d like to call pleasantly confused. 
[Laughing] I mean he was a wonderful soul, and as I’m fumbling and trying to learn, he was a breath of fresh 
air. He would make jokes, and at one point he had asked me if he had made an honest woman of me 
[laughing] because—while I was giving him a shower [laughs], and he said, “Now, I married you, right?” And 
that just gave me more drive to learn more about the business, and how important it, and things like that. 
I: 
So, how did you learn more about the business? 
P: 
Well, I actually heard about—I’m not sure exactly. My mother had gave me some names. Like I went to 
CPR training, things like that through other companies that she had worked for, worked with, so I started doing 
like in-service training, and then we heard about the BTBQ training, and so we chose to send—there was three 
of us that went through that training all from the same company—from my mom’s company. And that just got 
me more involved in healthcare. I ended up taking a phlebotomy course, and I’m a certified phlebotomist now. 
And I’ve taken some medical billing classes through Northwestern Michigan College, and I just—I think it’s a 
great field. I think that there is an immense need for it. I’ve seen situations and things that were not—I mean 
that just are not applicable and makes you wanna strive more to try to provide a service that is helpful and 
important and meets the needs of the client—not so much the families and the facilities needs, but more for the 
client themselves—the person that we’re in charge of. 
I: 
So, currently you are assisting as a manager for CP? 
P: 
Yes. I am actually co-owner of the Crystal Penny Incorporated Home Healthcare Company, and I do I 
guess administrative jobs, and I also am a PCA in the home. 
I: 
Okay. And you do the billing? 
P: 
Yeah.  
I: 
And you mentioned that you were— 
P: 
Scheduling [1.31.13]. 
I: 
--the scheduling. 
P: 
Yup. And I set up training, and I do payroll, things like that. 
I: 
And how many staff members do you have? 
P: 
Well, we fluctuate because we live in a resort community. We have definitely a busy season, and a 
down season, and during the down season we could have as little as four employees—me included—and in 
the summer as high as 14. 
I: 
And you do the training yourself with your staff? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18

P: 
Some of the training—most of the training is done with my mother. She’s the RN, so we will specifically 
look at the qualifications of our employees that apply, if they’re CNAs, things like that. Then we know that a 
certified nursing assistant has mostly been trained in a facility setting, so we will do kind of like a home training 
at the client that we’re going to place them with as far as understanding the challenges of being in a home 
instead of being in a facility. A lot of it is small bathrooms. 
I: 
What are some of the differences? 
P: 
[Laughing] one of ‘em is small bathrooms [laughing], and facilities—a lot of facilities have like a shower 
room or a bathroom that’s specifically geared for handicapped accessible, and walk-in tubs, things like that. 
And a lot of homes we look at bathrooms that we have to get family members to install grab bars, and we 
usually bring in shower chairs, things like that [1.29.13], and try to maneuver around them. Others are—it can 
be cluttered. The home can be cluttered. There can be throw rugs—that’s a big—that’s a big deal with people 
with walkers, and we have to collect them even sometimes against their own wishes but have to pleasantly 
coerce them into letting go of their beautiful throw rug that they love but they stumble on every day [laughs]. 
And then there’s just the medication—is a challenge in the home as compared to in a facility. Usually in a 
facility their medications are locked up. Medications are distributed by nurses, and they’re monitored to taking 
their medication. A lotta times in the home you’ve got family members who think that their loved one is 
perfectly capable of managing [laughing] their own medicine and come to find out they’re not. So, we try to 
encourage  the use of pillboxes, things like that. And a lotta times we will, like in certain situations if there’s an 
area of the home that can be locked, then we will take the medication and put them there. A lotta times with the 
dementia—forget to take meds, and then you’re all of a sudden you’ve forgot that you took your meds, and 
then all of a sudden you open the cupboard and you see your meds, and you’re like, “Oh, I have to take my 
meds,” and they take ‘em again, and so to decrease that kind of mistake or things like that. Other things were 
just cough medicine, you know, having Robitussin in the household. I was in a situation where I was monitoring 
a gentleman in the bathroom doing his ADLs—his shaving, and he actually had a bottle of rubbing alcohol that 
he used instead of his shave cream. You know, I put it in his hand, and he went to—and I had to stop that from 
that. And then there was another situation when he went to gargle with it, and it came to the point where I 
really, you know, you have to take it away. So, the family who are in and out of the house never thought of that 
as being a danger. You know, they don’t think of—the comment was brought to me that, “Well, he’s a very 
smart man.” Well, of course, he’s a very smart man, but he has Alzheimer’s, and one day that looks like 
mouthwash to him, you know, and so he’s thinking he’s—rinse his mouth with it. So, it doesn’t have to do with 
his intelligence at all. It’s just he forgets, or he forgot he took his meds, and then he wants to take ‘em again, 
things like that. And so, there’s a need to educate also family members in those situations as far as how 
different it is to have, yeah. You’re loved one is in the home, and they’re fine, and they’re not falling, and 
they’re not, you know, doing all these things so you think that that’s just how it’s gonna be forever, but you 
really can’t predict when there is gonna be a fall? When the situation is where they’re gonna think that a 
dishwashing pod is a piece a candy and open it and try to take a bite out of it. You don’t know when you’re 
gonna cross that bridge, and so we try to encourage people to get assistance in the home early so that it’s a 
smooth transition because there’s a lot involved in that, too, for clients. We’ve seen a lot of that—that 
agitation—increased agitation. Family members not understanding why their dad is all of a sudden cussing and 
angry all the time, and things like that. Well, maybe it’s because he gets up in the morning, and he doesn’t 
know where he is? You know, maybe we need to ask the other questions, you know, and that I think is the 
biggest thing with the difference between being in the home and being in a facility. Usually in the facility we’ve 
already got a diagnosis. We already know where we’re at. We already know this is what’s happening [1.24.35]. 
Alzheimer’s, dementia are progressive diseases, so it’s not gonna get better. We’re already here, we’re safe, 
things like that. In the home, family members may think that their loved ones are safe, but they’re not in the 
home 24 hours a day to see where that progression of that disease is going or where it’s headed. 
I: 
So, there’s not a full staff there watching all of the time.

P: 
Exactly. 
I: 
How is it different for the worker, for the PCA because they’re often the only person there, again, with 
no staff standing behind ‘em for backup. 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, it’s a very different situation for the PCA? 
P: 
Absolutely. Absolutely. And in our company, my phone’s on 24-7. Every employee knows if there’s a 
situation to call. We have policies and procedures in place for certain situations where if any of my employees 
feel unsafe, they feel that the participants unsafe, there’s emergency plans that we set up with the families 
because we do go over in our intake and assessments—we go over emergency plans. If we walk in and 
there’s a situation based on the wishes of the client, so we go by the DNR, things like that as far as those 
policies. We had a situation with a client who had a drastic decline. I mean like overnight decline, and he was 
very angry, and very strong. For somebody who could hardly walk, and it was very slow in most areas, one day 
he was extremely agitated, and angry, and he would grab—literally grab your hand like a vice and would not let 
go [1.22.33], and would be yelling at you, but incoherently. And in that situation, I received the phone call from 
my employee. First thing I asked, are you safe? Do you feel safe? And, yes, she felt safe, but she was very 
concerned. She had never seen this kind of behavior before, so I took the time to arrive at the home and try to 
assess the situation—called my mother who is the RN, and actually called the family member, who was in town 
to come over and see. And it simply was a situation where we figured out through all of us communicating and 
talking and going over the logs. I have the girl’s journal in the logs. We don’t do checkboxes because I don’t—I 
can’t get a big picture or the whole picture of what’s happening in the home from a checked box. I wanna know 
how we’re eating, days before things like that. Come to find out that we really narrowed it down to some 
constipation issues, and that he couldn’t verbalize how much pain he was in, and so that was the reaction from 
just being constipated, and we were able to get that cleared up pretty quickly. 
I: 
And then he was— 
P: 
And then he was fine. Yup. He was fine. He was like back to his old self, and we see that with UTIs as 
well, so we try to look for physical reason first before we immediately just say we can’t take care of your loved 
one because they’re too hostile; they’re too aggressive, and it’s too dangerous for my employees to take care 
of your loved one. So, we try to systematically go through and figure out, and the best way to do that is through 
the journaling—is to go back and see. We do write down how many—when was the last bowel movement, and 
those kinda things are documented.  
I: 
And what would you have done if there had been no journal? 
P: 
I have no idea what we would have done. I mean obviously my mother is [laughing] very smart in 
making sure that we journal correctly [1.20.05], but I think it would have been dealt with as a behavioral, as a 
stage—we’re crossing over into a stage of dementia where it becomes—there is aggression, which would have 
been the wrong diagnosis for him because once his situation—his medical situation cleared up, he was 
compliant. He was happy. He was back to his old self. We actually played a game of dominos 2 days later, 
so—and actually his verbal skills came back better than we ever thought because he couldn’t articulate 
anything. But it really had to do with how uncomfortable he was, physically. 
I: 
That’s such a dramatic example of what a difference it makes to have somebody in the house 
observing changes— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--in status. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18

P: 
Absolutely. And we try to pair people. We don’t—and it does no good to have six people taking care of 
one client. Just in and out, in and out, in and out whoever has it. So, I try to schedule people so that we have 
consistency in the home. That you get to know their personality, so that you can—I mean everybody has a bad 
day. Everybody has a good day. Everybody has quirks and things that happen, and if you’re not family with the 
client that you go into the home with and it’s just like a cold call, then you’re gonna be looking at the behaviors 
in a different light than somebody who’s been there for 3 months and knows that, you know, when it’s stormy 
outside, they don’t wanna get outta bed. It doesn’t mean that they’ve crossed into a situation where they can 
no longer get outta bed. We just know that, “Oh, it’s raining outside. It’s a good day to sleep.” [Laughing] and 
they’ll stay in bed. And we don’t force anybody [1.18.03] to get up if they don’t wanna get up. We make sure 
that they get proper nutrition, proper water, proper, you know, toileting, that kinda thing, but there is no, you 
know, oh, well, you have to get up and get to the lunchroom at 9 o’clock, so I’m gonna be very abrasive with 
you and get you up and get your ADLs done so that I can get you to the lunchroom. Like you see in facilities. 
Here you’re in your home, and if you don’t wanna get out bed—as long as you have some orange juice and 
take your medicine and we’ll put the TV on or the radio on, you can stay in bed. 
I: 
So, it’s very relationship-based. 
P: 
Yes. Absolutely. 
I: 
You get to know the person, and know what they like, what their usual routine is. 
P: 
Yes. And that’s like our mission statement is really we wanna keep people in their homes, around their 
familiar things, in a comfort zone, and try to keep their lives as normal as it was before the diagnosis of 
Alzheimer’s. We try to alleviate the fear and the anxiety that is brought on by, yeah, waking up and not knowing 
where you’re at. And just not being able to find the right words or trying to think of other things that [laughs] 
cause agitation with some of our clients. But those are the majority of them—not being able to articulate their 
needs, being able to say the right word, or have that communication. Another thing is that, you know, 
sometimes appetites change, taste buds change, and you know, if you’re somehow being fed something that is 
not agreeable, in the home it’s easy to go ahead and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, or make some 
thing different, or just, you know, change what meal is the heavy meal. We’ve done that before many times. 
Evening it just—"I just don’t want this. This is too much.” And they just push their food away, and it’s not that 
they’re rejecting nutrition or nutrients into their body, it’s just that their system has completely changed. So, 
let’s make lunch the big meal, and let’s make dinner some crackers and cheese, and we’ll watch Jeopardy. 
You know, we have the flexibility. In a facility, they don’t really have that flexibility [1.15.25]. And then they can 
just write refused food, and that is a bad labeling on what’s really happening. You know, because in a facility if 
they don’t eat dinner—refuse dinner, you know, and so that goes to a nurse, and a nurse looks at that from a 
medical point of view, from a clinical point of view, saying that, “Oh, well, we’re getting worse, or we’re gonna 
need medication. You know, because what’s really going on? Instead of it being something as simply as I just 
don’t have appetite, or what I’m looking at on this huge plate is not—it’s too much. You know, so. 
I: 
So, there’s a lot of problem solving and kind of learning how to respond to fluid situations. 
P: 
Absolutely. Absolutely. 
I: 
And can you talk about how you fulfill your mission statement? I mean some of it is just getting to know 
the person, helping them continue to live their usual routine and things like that, but what are some of the 
physical tasks you do? 
P: 
Well, it really depends on the needs of—it depends on the needs of the client themselves, and so being 
a tailor-based care plan for the needs of the client. So, if there is, you know, doctors’ appointments, they have 
a barber they go to, things like that, we accommodate them for those activities. It really is personal to each 
person/individual. We—and we ask our participants. We ask the client, what do you want us to do while we’re 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
5
here? In some situations, depending on where they are, even if they’re in dementia—in a stage 3 dementia or 
Alzheimer’s, if they just want ice cream, and they say, “I want ice cream.” Well, we’ll make a point in the care 
plan to say that this [laughing] person really wants ice cream, and we’ll take ‘em to go to the ice cream parlor 
and get an ice cream, yeah, or take ‘em to the park, or if they like boats, we’ll go to the harbor, things like that 
[1.13.03]. So, it’s a tailored—we’re able to tailor the care plan to the individual. 
I: 
We’re gonna take a little pause right here. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
That went so fast. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I2: 
It’s ‘cause you’re so good. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
Right. I can’t believe that was 20 minutes. 
P: 
Was that 20 minutes? 
I2: 
Twenty-four minutes. 
P: 
Wow. 
I2: 
I’m gonna ask you an off-camera question [laughs]. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
What’s a benefit of a facility? 
P: 
You’re asking the wrong person. 
I2: 
Okay. 
P: 
Well, actually, I shouldn’t say that. I have had to accompany some of our clients, like the gentleman 
who fell and broke his neck. I had to go with him. We took care of him at Munson. We took care of him at the 
Rehab Center. 
I2: 
I’m listening to you by the way. 
P: 
Yeah. And we then brought him home, and I was like a crazy lady. I was with the family saying, you 
have to get him home. You have to get him home because I saw things that were happening in the facility that 
were not just—I mean maybe ‘cause I’m a germaphobe or something, but like the people would come in. They 
wouldn’t change their gloves, or if they came in they would get the hand sanitizer was really more for 
themselves and not for the client. So, I was like, okay, well, we’ve got this 94-year-old [laughing] gentleman 
here, and we’re not practicing good, you know, infectious control. We’re not practicing—and not having the 
ability to really take care of the clients—we did 24-hour care with a client—that client overnight at a facility here 
in town, and it was literally—like the night I was there I felt like I was in a horror movie. People moaning and 
crying out, “Help me. Help me,” and aides going by saying, “You’re in a depends, just go to the bathroom.” But 
this person is asking to be taken to the bathroom because to maintain their dignity, so they don’t have to go to 
the bathroom on themselves, so I don’t have a lotta good things to say about facilities. I would rather have 
somebody [1.10.37] in the home with 24-hour care until they pass away. 
I2: 
Yeah. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

P: 
Absolutely. 
I2: 
Fair enough. 
I: 
Are we good? 
I2: 
Thanks, yes. Sorry about that. 
P: 
That’s okay. I think it’s criminal. 
I2: 
I kind of wish I was recording that one. 
P: 
Yeah, oh [laughing]. Oh, these ones are, yeah. 
I: 
Are you ready to go? 
I2: 
I am just about to be. 
I: 
So, K is using—we’re doing a new thing today. We have two tripods instead of one, so that he doesn’t 
have to be movin’ all over the place [1.10.10], and he can sit there [group laughter], and he might be able to 
like jump in ‘cause he has great questions, and a different perspective. 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
So, he might actually jump in and ask a few things too. 
P: 
Sure. 
I2: 
Okay. 
I: 
Alrighty. So, let’s switch gears a little bit, and I know with homecare one thing that’s different than a 
facility is that a lot of homecare workers don’t have any idea what they’re walkin’ into especially that first time, 
right? It takes some time to get to know the client, the families, but they have to be ready for anything. 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
So, I’ve heard a number of stories of different things that personal care workers have had to face, and 
I’m just gonna throw out some of these scenarios, and you let us know if it’s happened to you, if you’ve had 
these experiences and how you’ve handled them. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
Okay? 
P: 
Mmm hmm. 
I: 
So, have you ever gone into a place and you felt like you just were not prepared enough? You didn’t 
have the skills. It was above your skill level. You didn’t know how to handle the situation. 
P: 
Yes. Yes. I have. 
I: 
Can you tell us about it? 
P: 
Yeah. It was actually my first actual hands on, and it was in a situation where we had a client that was 
injured, and it was our gentleman that had fallen and broken his neck [1.08.28], and we went into—and I 
thought—I was told [laughing] by my mother because he was at the hospital that it was gonna be easy. I was 
just gonna be like a sitter, and it really wasn’t. I wasn’t easy. It wasn’t—I wasn’t a sitter. He would constantly 
wanna get up. He didn’t realize he had a catheter, so he would be jumping outta bed, not pressing a button for 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
7
the nurses [laughing] or anything. He’d be like, “I have to go to the bathroom.” And I tried to say, it’s okay. You 
can go. You have a catheter, and that just was not connecting with him at all. And I felt like I was useless 
because he literally every 5 minutes was jumping to go to the bathroom to get outta the bed, and here he had a 
broken neck, and yeah, I was pressing the button for the nurses, and the nurses weren’t coming, and yeah, I 
felt very overwhelmed and that I was not prepared for this. 
I: 
What were you thinking at that point? 
P: 
Call my mom [group laughter]. Cry. It’s scary because all I could imagine is that here he’s survived this 
fall, and he’s okay, but he has a broken neck, and he’s gonna jump outta this bed and fall and be dead 
[1.07.08], and that was all that was on my mind. But we survived that first night, and it was okay, you know, but 
yeah, it just takes a while. Once I could get through to him, and I was able to maneuver myself, you know, I 
basically sat right next to him on the side and held his hand, and would just talk to him, and we would watch 
TV. When he’d wake up, he’d fall asleep, he’s wake up, and I could get his mind on something other than—and 
I think the reason why he felt he had to go to the bathroom was because he knew—well, he had the sensation 
of the catheter, but didn’t understand what exactly that was. So, in his mind he thought that meant he had to go 
to the bathroom, but it was actually the catheter itself was in there.  
I: 
So, you had to figure out and learn how to deal with that situation. 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
And you tried different things. 
P: 
Yes. Yes. It was a long night [laughing]. 
I: 
But you’ve had him as a client for a while after that, right? 
P: 
Oh, yes. Absolutely. He lived to be 98 years old. 
I: 
So, you had him for how many years? 
P: 
Well, that woulda been—well, my mother started with him before I even started, so I think he was a 
client of my mother’s business for like 9 years, yup. Eight or nine. 
I: 
Wow. So, you got to know him. 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
I mean some people in that situation would say, “Eh, I’m outta here. This isn’t for me.” But you hung in 
there.  
P: 
I did hang in there, and that did cross my mind [1.05.39]—absolutely crossed my mind, and I was just, 
yeah, I was way overwhelmed, but— 
I: 
But you hung in there, and it sounds like you discovered a career that you really enjoy? 
P: 
You know, I actually did because through that whole experience of him going into the hospital, and then 
he went into rehab, and seeing—I mean I saw how—number 1, how elder people are treated. That was a big 
thing for me. Even the doctors were very pessimistic because he had broken his neck, and they’re like, “Well, 
you need to make plans now. He’ll probably only survive about year after a break like this.” And all these 
things, and it was like, no. How can you just give up [laughing], you know what I mean? You can’t just say that 
and say, oh, yeah. And it was wonderful because he did outlast that one year by quite a few years [laughing], 
and so it became like a—I don’t know. It’s kinda like most things in my life. If I find interest in it or I find a 
passion for it, it becomes super important. I wanna learn as much as I can about it. I wanna continue with it,

Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18

and I wanna try to make a difference [1.04.12] for somebody. For either their life or the community or just the 
profession itself. 
I: 
And you feel like you’re doing that? 
P: 
Yeah. I do. I feel like I am. 
I: 
You’re making a difference. What else do you find rewarding about it? If you could tell us what you find 
rewarding about this kinda work? 
P: 
Wow. Just the interaction with people. I think for me I’m kind of a people person anyways, and I will 
take 5 minutes of a joke with somebody who’s normally alone all day over, you know, a bonus check. You 
know, just those little things. Those moments of joy is how I look at it. You get people that—we have clients 
that are depressed, and you can tell they’re depressed, and if for whatever reason I can, you know, get a smile 
or get a chuckle or something, then that’s worth it, you know. That’s worth it to me. 
I: 
Have you ever been in a situation where you felt afraid? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
I am guessing that you develop close relationships with your clients especially those that you’ve had for 
years, how do you feel when they die? 
P: 
Well, it’s like losing a loved one, honestly. It’s hard, but there’s a way you can deal with it. You’re 
preparing yourself for it. I think with our longest client, the one I was talking about earlier, we knew. I knew he 
was kinda on borrowed time. You know, like we’re at 98. We just celebrated our 98th birthday, and I had an 
employee who was pregnant, and he was so cute. He was [laughing] like, is that my child [laughs]? It was 
hysterical, and that’s how he left. He left still in that—he never really went into a situation where he was unable 
to communicate or the things that you see at end stage of Alzheimer’s. I think what they decided—what they 
determined at his autopsy. He had a stroke, and he passed away. So, it’s hard for all the employees. All my 
employees. We’ve lost a lot of clients, but we—my mother tries to have in-services about that a lot, and about 
how you can’t—you maintain a boundary—a professional boundary, but still be able to be loving and caring 
and compassionate [1.01.04]. And it’s pretty important, and it’s not just important for the dynamics of what’s 
happening as your job, but how you deal with the loss at the end of that contract, I guess would be the way to 
say it. In a clinical term, the contracts over, but understanding that you made a difference, you know, it was 
important, and take pride in that, and what we do is those moments of joy. That’s our job, and if we make the 
end life as pleasant and as happy as possible, but it’s hard. Everybody deals with it differently. 
I: 
How about dealing with family members? 
P: 
[Laughs] yeah, well, yeah. Dealing with family members, it’s very difficult. We have a strict policy that 
family members communicate only to me or my mother. We do not encourage or allow family members to 
communicate directly with—I mean in just areas of concern for their loved one, but we’re not saying not to have 
a relationship with the niece or the  nephew or whoever. We can’t, but any kind of changes to the care plan, 
any kind of criticisms, any kind of directions we tell our employees to direct those questions and those 
comments to W or P. And that’s how we deal with it because family dynamics. I’ve seen every family dynamic 
imaginable from sibling rivalries to borderline abusive scenarios. I mean just—and it’s very hard on the—on all 
of us.  I mean even me as the administrator, you know, I get calls from three or four different people that want 
to change the care plan. They wanna do this; they wanna do that. They wanna change this. In fact, we had 
[laughs]. Okay, we had a couple that we had been—my mother had been hired years ago before I started with 
them, and they had specifically done the care plan, and the family dynamics is that together—the wife and him 
had no children, but he had children from a previous marriage. And she had a niece who was her POA, so in 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18

that dynamics there was so many different voices, and so [57.52] many different ideas of how the care should 
be, and how things should work. And we actually were fired twice from that job. 
I: 
Twice. 
P: 
Yeah. And hired back. 
I: 
And fired again? 
P: 
Yup. And hired back, and fired again, and then, yeah. 
I: 
So, what was the end one? Were you fired or rehired? 
P: 
We weren’t fired [laughs]. That was not the terminology that they wanted to use at the end, but at the 
end it had gotten to the point where the Alzheimer’s for the wife was so bad that she was institutionalized, and 
the husband was 10 years older, and he had gotten to the point where he needed skilled nursing. I mean we—
my mother kind of felt that he would do better with the way things were as far as having us there because he 
had some characteristics—some conditions that we knew about, so that like they labeled him as aspirating, but 
it really wasn’t. It was just that he had back curvature so bad, scoliosis so bad that he did not have breath 
strength, so if we just did something as simple as deep breath and cough, we could clear that aspiration, but 
the family decided, and which they are POAs, they decide. They do what they do, and so that at the end it was 
more like we don’t need your help anymore because he’s in a nursing facility, and so that was the end of that 
contract. So, but it was challenging. It really was. 
I: 
I’m sure you’ve had some real positive relationships with families, too. I’m guessing you’ve run the 
gambit. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. The whole gambit, and I don’t wanna say that that last family was not positive. I mean they 
were—it all came from places of love. It was just a different reality of what that, you know, what that meant for 
each family member. So, but, yeah, we’ve had excellent relationships with families. We’ve had families that 
absolutely would even in a situation with a hospitalization would absolutely go to our employees [55.19], and 
want to hear from the employee more so than the doctor [laughing], you know. I mean like, “Okay, so what was 
happening yesterday, and how was this, and what we—and what do you think we should do?” [Laughing] and, 
you know, and my employees all know that any medicine advice has to go through my mother, and we’re pretty 
much—because we’re small, we talk all the time. So, my employees communicate to me. If I haven’t ran 
across it or, you know, researched it or understand it in any way—I call my mother. And then we kinda come 
up with a game plan, and we do universal texting, and so I can do a text blast out to everybody—all my 
employees. One text that says, this is what’s happening with Mrs. So, and so, and this is what we’re gonna do, 
and this is what we’re gonna try to do, and keep this in mind, blah, blah, blah, and send it out, and everybody is 
on the same page at the same time. We also have a process because I’ve had situations where I’ve walked 
into and had no clue to what I was doing. That feeling I didn’t want anybody that worked for me to feel that 
way, and being that I did policies and procedures, and I was a quality engineer, and I wrote operation 
instructions [laughing] for the people on the floors building cars or whatever, I felt we had to have a better 
process. So, we developed a process where I start out at the house, and we do an assessment interview or 
intake.  And then we build a care plan off of that. Then I spend the first 2 days in the home to kind of get the 
feel of the—the lay of the land as I say and get to know what’s going on. And then I personally train people, 
and then I start—and the company takes a hit for it because we don’t get paid for two people to be in the 
home, but to me I’d rather take that 4-hour hit than have anybody walk into a situation that they are—
absolutely can’t deal with, and call me up and say, “I quit.” [Laughing] you know. I don’t want that scenario to 
ever happen, and we get a lotta input for families, and that’s important too. Just as important as taking the care 
plans. We usually take the assessment sheet to a primary care physician, and we have them put it in their file. 
We have them either approve it or makes notes of things that are, you know, they feel should be happening 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
10
[52.41]. We had one primary care physician that wanted us to do PT, and none of us had ever been mentioned 
by a family member or [laughing] anything, but apparently there was an order for physical therapy for balance. 
And so, absolutely I got that note. We absolutely—I went to my mother. My mother got me—what are they 
there? Sheets from physical therapy for elder for balance—exercises, things like that. We got those in the 
home. We set up a schedule so that those were done. Even if it was just marching in the chair kinda things—
exercises that were done in the home. So, it’s important to get a team involved in the process. 
I: 
How about situations where you have very different viewpoints or value systems than the client or the 
families or whether it’s around— 
P: 
Okay. I know what you’re saying. We have in our code of ethics and policies and procedures a whole 
page based on that. We don’t discriminate. We don’t—I’m not gonna send somebody who’s uncomfortable, 
and like let’s say we do a lot of times we take clients to church. So, if somebody wanted to go to Synagogue or 
they wanted to go to whatever, you know, the Buddhist temple or whatever, we do that. And I make a point in 
my interviewing process to cover that [50.38] because I don’t want anybody that won’t or feels uncomfortable 
or thinks like that for those scenarios. 
I: 
So, cultural differences, religious, sexual orientation, all of that I’m sure you— 
P: 
We cover it. 
I: 
You cover it, and so the PCAs know how to deal with that. If they go into a home and the client, you 
know, comes from a very different viewpoint than they do. 
P: 
Yeah. We also—we have a very—with our boundaries, we also cover political. I mean just in this last 
political scenario we had—I have employees that do not share my viewpoint on who they voted [laughing] for, 
and you have to stay professional because your politics are not, you know, I mean it’s not—it’s not appropriate 
to voice your politics with a client or with your coworkers even. I mean that’s your personal—who you vote for, 
you close those little things and vote for—that’s your business. So, we have a very strict rule about discussing 
politics in front of clients, and things like that. But, you know, I’m friends with some of my employees on 
Facebook, and I just have to unfollow them, and [laughing] you know, and just be like, okay. Now, if there’s 
something that is racist, I did have an employee that made a racist comment, and I let it be known that that’s 
not acceptable, and nobody can work for me that has those views. And they don’t work for me, so in a lotta 
ways it’s okay to be friends on Facebook, but I’m still—I can’t, you know, for myself—oh, I keep hitting that 
thing [laughs]. For myself, I can’t have somebody work for me that’s racist, and I can’t have somebody that’s—
we had a lady who was Catholic, and she’s wonderful. Heartfelt, loving, wonderful person, but decided to take 
a client to her church, and the client has dementia so has no idea, you know, just whatever. But the family was 
mortified because she didn’t see anything wrong with it, and she had documented it, and of course the family—
I encourage the family to come read what is happening, and the family read it [47.46], I guess, and immediately 
contacted me. So, of course, immediately I had to stop whatever I was doing and just apologize profusely and 
say that is absolutely against our policies and procedures, and in fact, I have a page on religious freedom—the 
whole point of America is we have freedom of religion and for religion, and your religious beliefs cannot be 
imposed on your client. And so, I took care of it. I had to handle the situation, and my employee was so 
offended by me being upset with her taking the client to Catholic church that she quit. And I was like win: win. 
I2: 
I understand from the perspective of your policies and coaching PCAs on how to manage difficult 
situations where there is a disagreement or, but what about one of the PCAs being discriminated against or 
stigmatized because they have a different opinion or a different political views or different sexual orientation 
or— 
P: 
By coworkers? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
11
I2: 
By their clients. 
P; 
Oh, by the—oh, well, I’ve got a great story for ya. Here’s a story. We have an employee—an African 
American man—and we had a client who was a reverend, and the family was totally like, “Man is perfect. We 
want a man with dad. Dad’s crazy. He’s hard to take care of,” whatever. And so, I had asked does your father 
have some prejudices? Is there any kind of anything, ‘cause I have an employee that I would like to send I 
think would be a good fit? And it’s hard as an employer to bring that up without it being considered 
inappropriate to ask, so do you mind having a black person come to your house? You know, I mean it was 
really hard for me. It was difficult for me to come with that question, but I didn’t wanna put my employee in a 
situation that would be difficult. So, it’s like this—I’m on a [laughing] tightwire rope ‘cause I don’t really know 
how to be politically correct about this, and what are the laws, and so anyways I just asked, and the family was 
totally like, “Oh, no. He’s wonderful, and we’re from Detroit, and it’s all good. Everything’s great. No problem.” 
Okay. Great. So, I set up the client to be there. I had met with him first like I always do [44.43], and he was 
quite the gentleman. He was a wonderful guy, and apparently the reverend has—because of his dementia his 
personality has changed because, yeah, once my employee got there he was using all kinds of the N word, 
and all kinds of the—yes. To the point where the reverend had had an accident and would not allow my 
employee to clean him up, and he actually threw himself on the ground, and so, of course, my employee calls 
me. And I’m like [laughing], I have no idea what to do. So, I have to call my mom. So, here it is midnight shift, 
right, and I’m like wake up, mom. Wake up. And she’s like, “Well, have him call the daughter.” The daughter 
lives down state, and the daughter was the one who hired us. “Call the daughter. Maybe she can talk to him.” 
Okay. So, the daughter tried to talk to the—and of course, they’re mortified. I mean they’re absolutely mortified, 
and so they called the sheriff. The daughter called the sheriff thinking in some way that the sheriff would make 
her dad get up [laughing], let my employee clean him up, and get up off the floor. Well, come to find out the 
sheriff shows up, and the sheriff said, you know, he said—the reverend says, “You can’t make me get up off 
this floor if I don’t want to.” And the sheriff said, “You’re right. I can’t, so if you wanna lay there in your own 
bowel movement all night, that’s on you.” And the daughter is, you know, said, you know, that my employee 
can leave. I had contacted and talked to my employee. He’s like, “No. I just—I don’t think this is—I think this is 
more of a manipulation to try to get the daughter to come back up here.” ‘Cause the daughter had gone back 
home. They put us in place. Daughter went back home. He says, “I don’t really think is —I mean, yeah, I’m all 
kinds of names, but—“ he says, “I just really don’t think that—I’ll just stay if that’s okay?” I said, well, yeah, 
unless he kicks you out, you can stay. And so, after the sheriff left and everything, and after everybody left and 
stuff, and the reverend decided to let my employee clean him up and get him up off the floor and get him 
cleaned up and back in bed. But that was so hard for me. I mean I just I felt horrible for my employee. My 
employee took it better than I did as far as he was like, “Nope. It’s no big deal. It’s not like I haven’t heard that 
word before.” 
I: 
Wow. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Great story. Thank you. 
P: 
[Laughs] you’re welcome. 
I2: 
Thank you very much. 
I: 
We’re gonna take another pause. 
P: 
Okay. I tried not to cuss in that because there was a lotta cussing in that story [group laughter]. It was 
like, okay. I gotta stop. I gotta think of a word. Well [inaudible] thinking a word, try not to cuss.

I2: 
You know how like someone is like having a conversation with you, and they keep checking their 
phone, that’s how I feel like in these conversations ‘cause I have to keep checking like four devices here. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
But I’m listening very closely and thank you so much. That is—that kinda thing is really incredible to be 
able to get people to relate. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, did—I’m gonna capture it over here. I wanna just finish that story out. 
P: 
Sure. 
I: 
Did that employee continue to care for that gentlemen? 
P: 
Yeah. Yeah. Up until the point where he had—I think he had—he had a mini stroke, and the family had 
decided to take him down state and put him in a facility near them. 
I: 
And for the remainder of the time that he was here, did the reverend continue to verbally abuse the 
employee? 
P: 
Not—you know once in a while when he got angry about whatever, it would come out. But my mother 
was very good in that situation because my mother had talked to my employee [40.27]—talked to him a lot 
about how sometimes with these—there was a suspected small mini strokes happening. He did have 
dementia. It was not diagnosed Alzheimer’s, but it was dementia, but my mom thought it was vascular or Lewy-
bodies, which is more of a brain issue, and that you see these dramatic changes in personality, and because 
the family was adamant that he’s been this reverend, he loves everyone, he’s baptized black people in Detroit, 
and this is just not him is probably true. It really wasn’t him, and it was because he was having TMIs, and so 
it’s like—it’s hard to explain. 
I: 
Yeah. How do you explain that? 
P: 
You don’t. ‘Cause you don’t know. I mean not of this is—you can’t really diagnosis Alzheimer’s until an 
autopsy anyways, so you really—you’re just kinda guessing. 
I: 
The brain is such a mystery. 
P: 
It is, and we have other stories about families just mortified about how their—you know, we had a client 
that became lecherous. 
I: 
Oh, my. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Well, let’s talk about that in a second. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
Almost there, almost there. 
P: 
The lecherous— 
I: 
Yeah. The lecherous story. No, I’m afraid of how I’m gonna act when I get dementia. All of a sudden, I’ll 
be [laughs] person— 
P: 
Yeah. I figure I’ll stop cussing. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

I: 
Really? 
P: 
Yeah. Oh, yeah. 
I: 
Maybe I’ll do the reverse. 
P: 
Yeah. Start cussing. 
I: 
Cussin’ all the time. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
[Laughter]. 
I: 
Hear K cussin’ [inaudible]— 
P: 
Yeah? 
I2: 
Oh, that’s funny. Okay. Just changing batteries here, and then I’ll be ready to go. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
We should have like hand-signaled or something like that [group laughter]. 
I: 
Yeah. Did you lose your little note? 
I2: 
It’s in my bag. I’ll get that right now, actually. Yeah. Both times I’ve forgotten that, but. 
I: 
You can just poke me [38.24]. 
I2: 
Sorry about that, yeah. 
P: 
That really craves those batteries, huh? 
I2: 
Long story, but short story, yes [laughs]. There’s an internal battery here that stopped working, and I 
have to order it online. You can’t just buy it in the store. 
P: 
Ah. 
I2: 
And the internal battery is rechargeable, but [laughs]. 
I: 
These are not. 
I2: 
Yeah. These are not, and that’s too bad. 
I: 
I won’t go far I promise. I just wanna make sure these are still. 
I2: 
You’re such a great conversationalist. 
P: 
Oh, well, good. 
I2: 
Thank you. 
P: 
I was like second guessing myself. I was like do I really wanna do this? Yeah, I do. 
I: 
I’m so glad you told yourself yes. 
I2: 
Yeah. This is— 
P: 
I was like, yeah. I wanna do this. Yes [37.23].

I2: 
I just prepared your Ferndale audio by the way, last night. 
I: 
Good, good, good. Thank you. All right. I don’t know what that one’s doing, but I will have—I’ll find out 
later. Okay? 
I2: 
Yes. 
I: 
Okay. This time is going way too fast [group laughter]. I know you have thousands of stories. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
I’m gonna finish up that last section, and then quickly switch gears ‘cause you mentioned a lecherous 
[laughing] person. You know, we’ve heard a lot of stories about personal care workers dealing with racism or 
different beliefs and value systems, and things like that. And in this “Me Too Movement,” what about sexual 
harassment?  
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
Inappropriate sexual behavior. 
P: 
And it happens, and we had a client, prominent family in this town, and he needed help because he had 
suffered strokes. There was no dementia, but I think there probably was, but it was not diagnosed [35.53]. But 
he was having strokes, and he had a hard time with movement on his left side. He had done rehab, all kinds of 
stuff, so he was in his own home, and he needed care, and they wanted 24-hour care. So, when we first 
started it was just day-time care, and mother started in there. And my mother was like [sigh], how do you say—
she was leery because he would say dirty jokes. So, she was like, you know, I don’t know who to put in there 
because, you know, eh, you know, I can tell him, “Now, stop that!” And he laughs, and ha, ha, ha, ha, like he’s 
a naughty boy, and they go on about their day. And so, I told my mom I said let’s do—let’s get some 
information, some literature, and let’s do a little training, and try to have anybody who goes in there feel that 
they can leave at anytime they feel unsafe, they do not have to be touched, all these things. And my mom said, 
“That’s great.” And during this time, we were compiling all this information and trying to get schedules set. To 
have this in-service, I had to do a shift, and of course I’m getting the shower ready, and he put his hand in my 
back pocket, [laughing], and I had the back scrubber in my hand and turned around and I said, look! I said it’s 
you and I in here, and who do you suppose is gonna win [laughing]. Don’t touch me like that. And he giggled 
and laughed, and said, “Sorry.” And we moved on. You know, we got the shower done, and we got him 
dressed, and everything and together. So, we had our in-service. We let everybody know that this, you know, 
that this is who he is. He’s kind of—it’s not like—I mean it was easy for me to say, you know, kind of in a joking 
kind of way with that little back scrubber, by hey!! What’s up? Stop that! And so, we gave everybody the 
permission to leave, first of all, if you feel uncomfortable. You don’t have to engage in any conversation with 
him. If he touches you in an inappropriate way, you can just leave. Call me from outside the house. I mean just 
go outside and call me and let me know and it’s okay [33.14]. So, we got this all together, and things seemed 
to be going really well, and we had a situation where I had an employee in there that was I guess a little more 
receptive to some of the sexual scenarios that were going on there, and so we had—I had one of my 
employees who [went to] relieve my other employee call me, and say, “I don’t know what to say. I don’t know 
what to do. There’s something going on, and I’m not really sure what it is, but it was like I walked in on my 
mom and my dad.” [Laughing]. “It was like, what??” So, I said okay we’ll—thank you—we’ll take care of it. Is he 
trying anything with you? “Well, he makes those dirty jokes, but I just blow him off, and it’s whatever, but no. 
He’s not trying to touch me. He’s not trying to, you know, do whatever.” And so, I thought, well, I’m gonna 
switch it up a little bit, and so because they’re all women that are working with him. So, I put my male 
employee in there, and he called me. And he said, “My coworker, so and so, is allowing him to touch her while 
watching TV, and in a kind of romantic kind of setting.” Now, this is two people [saying this about one of the 
employees], so immediately the call comes from my employee who’s there saying things about my [male] 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
15
employee [laughing]—my male employee about how he is terrible, and you’re gonna get me fired. And I’m like, 
okay, how am I gonna get you fired if I’m you’re boss? So, all of a sudden light bulbs come up in my mind, that 
I have an employee who no longer feels that they’re my employee. That they have somehow crossed a 
boundary and have entered into a relationship kind of in their mind with their client—my client—with a 
participant. It was very confusing, so then she calls my mother. I’m on the phone; I’m in the car at this point 
because I obviously have to take over [laughing] the shift, right [laughing] because this is unacceptable 
[laughing]. Whatever is happening it’s unacceptable. We can’t let this continue, and so I drive there and 
everything. And, yeah, it was very obvious that she felt—she called the client “daddy”. And I said, eh you need 
to go, and so I did the overnight, and I had another employee set up for the morning shift. And my employee 
that I fired showed up for her shift [laughing]. And was just like, “No. I’m here. This is my home,” and I was like, 
you’re home? This is a job. I was like I need to call the police, don’t I. I was totally unprepared for this. So, I’ve 
got the sexual situation from a client and an employee all in the same household, and I was 100% unprepared 
for it. But I got my mom over there. I got the son [laughing] of the participant, who is a lawyer in town 
[laughing], got everybody there to hash it all out. And we did get it cleared up, but that was—it was a scenario I 
never thought I would have—sexual harassment for my employees, but that in a situation where it was almost 
like she was really [sigh]—I don’t know how to explain it. I don’t know if it was because of the mansion that she 
was in, and that, you know, the—I have no idea where her mindset was, but she really felt [28.47] that she was 
a part of the family, that the family loved her, which the son was mortified, and yeah, that she was engaging in 
this relationship—that they were a couple. And where the boundary split I really don’t know when it really 
actually happened, but— 
I: 
That’s quite a story. 
P: 
Isn’t it. It’s not something we want on a resume [laughing], but it happens, so when you talk about 
caring about a client, and developing feelings, I mean you think of it as a maternal kinda thing or a, you know, 
like I wanna take care of this person. Not in a romantic scenario, but I guess if you don’t have healthy 
boundaries in your own person that that’s where those lines blur, and they get real weird. And the fact that he 
was kind of lecherous was maybe she needed that. I don’t know. She took that as advances for a relationship 
as opposed to he’s just bein’ touchy/feely ‘cause that’s what he wants to be. I don’t know. 
I: 
So, you’ve had to draw on some skills that you maybe didn’t know you had or to [laughing] develop 
some skills or—so, I’m gonna switch gears now and take the last few minutes to talk about this work in a 
bigger context with, you know, from a political standpoint, social value. As you know, we have a critical 
shortage of PCAs. 
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
Especially up here in the rural areas, people are just cryin’ for help—the employers, agencies—and part 
of it is, well, we just can’t find the employees, but you also have the turnover, and then you have the 
employees that, you know, shouldn’t be in this line of work. 
P: 
[Laughing] absolutely. Yes. Yes. 
I: 
But I think it’s pretty well known that one of the reasons for the shortage is the poor working conditions, 
like the wages—low wages, low benefits— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--lack of guaranteed hours, lack of training, all of that. Can you talk about that for a moment? 
P: 
Absolutely. In fact, I have some pretty strong opinions about that. Number one, I think that unfortunately 
due to whatever reason—I’m not sure—but people don’t plan for the end-of-life. They really don’t. A lot of 
people don’t even have wills, don’t, you know—they don’t set themselves up. They think they have a good

retirement [25.57]. They think it’s great, but they have no idea about the cost of Alzheimer’s or things like, you 
know, something like that. As far as quality of life in relationship to your monetary or just your resources—what 
resources you have. So, there’s very limited choices. If you don’t have any money, you have to go into a 
facility, you have to rely on your family, you have to, you know, try to make something work. You can go 
through the Commission on Aging, Area Agency on Aging, and those kind of things, but Medicare only pays 
out a certain amount of money per hour. And, in fact, I wanted to go through the voucher program, but there’s 
no way I can take a client for $18 an hour, pay somebody $12 an hour and be a viable company. I have liability 
insurance, unemployment insurance, workmen’s comp. I can’t—there’d be no money. I wouldn’t be able to pay 
my insurance and be a company. So, I think that [24.41] the standard has to be raised up a little bit better. I 
think Medicare needs to pay more for services because they’re kind of the standby. The majority of people that 
I get a lot of calls—I get a lotta calls, and I get a lotta people that when I say what my rates are, and I say this 
is why my rates are this way, and no, I don’t bill through Medicare, they can’t use me. So, that’s number one. 
So, if Medicare is only paying $18 an hour, any agency that goes through Medicare has to pay their employees 
$8 to make any kinda—to be able to cover benefits, to be able to cover insurance, and liability, all that. So, 
that’s what sets it. So, we’re lucky in a sense that we do a lot of private pay, but I have to stay competitive. You 
know, I would love to pay my employees $15 an hour. I would love to do that. I would love to make $15 
[laughing] an hour, but I have to be competitive to the big chains that are around, and the big chains can 
charge less and pay less because they have more clients to be able to make their profits. They have—and I 
mean all over the state of Michigan, you know. Some of them are franchised, and so then the franchise owners 
are still—they use that kind of a turnover on purpose almost to say that, “It’s okay. I don’t, you know, I can pay 
you $10 an hour, and we’ll just keep, you know, instead of giving you a raise, we’ll just get rid of you, and we’ll 
get somebody else in,” and that kinda stuff. So, it’s the dynamics of it. Coming from an engineering point of 
view, there has to be added value at every step for it to be a system change or a—what is—system isn’t the 
word I want [laughing]. A business model change is that you have to have added value at every step, so if 
we’re gonna add value to the wages, then we have to have more education, then that adds value. So, like 
CNAs get paid more than, you know, a volunteer, you know, somebody who has no education at all. But if we 
can regulate it so that the only people who can work in home healthcare as a home health aide, a PCA, a 
CNA, whatever the label you wanna put on it, is that we have to get a little more strict with the people who are 
utilizing private people. If I can go to Craig’s List—okay, let’s say Grandma needs somebody 4 hours a day, 7 
days a week just to help with showers and laundry or whatever, and I can go to Craig’s List and I can get 
somebody in for $15 an hour, I’m gonna do that because if I call up the Crystal Penny, Incorporated, they’re 
gonna charge me $23 an hour. Okay, but they don’t look at the benefits and the liabilities of making that 
choice. The person—well, I’ll tell you a story. When I first started in this company, my mother had contract 
workers. That’s how she ran her business, so I’m getting all the paperwork together. I said, Ma, we should 
probably be a real business because a real business with employees then we can use the long-term disability 
insurance companies ‘cause I had a client that had long-term disability, but they wouldn’t just pay Joe Schmo. 
They need a real business, so I said, let’s do the paperwork. Let’s get this all together, and so I got online, I got 
all the paperwork, and I downloaded everything, and I went through. I mean, oh, crazy stuff [laughs], and on 
this form it said I needed the name of my contract worker and their contract number. So, I called up so and so 
[19.56], and I said, okay. I need your contract number. “What’s that?” I said, well, your contract number. You’re 
a contract worker, right? You carry your own liability insurance? “Well, no. I just—you mean my 1099?” Ah, no. 
I don’t mean your [laughing] 1099. That’s self-employed. I said, no, you have to be—to be a contract worker in 
the state of Michigan, you have to have a contract worker number. None of these—NONE of my mother’s 
employees had contract numbers. I said, Mom, we’re in trouble. I said, do you understand that your liability is 
insane right now. Like you could lose your property. You could lose your inheritance. You could lose anything if 
one person falls—slips and falls in a home that you put them in. And she had no idea, so I had to get a lawyer 
and all that. We handled all that and put it all together. But going through that process, if we could close that 
gap to let people know really what’s at stake by hiring, you know, somebody off Craig’s List, that you could lose 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
17
everything. Everything your parents worked for, everything that—I mean it could be like family money. It could 
be inheritance. It could be whatever. Somebody falls, and becomes disabled because of a fall in your home, 
your homeowner’s insurance is gonna cover a certain amount, but they are free to sue you for everything. And 
if we can close that gap that puts the added value on the profession. 
I: 
Now, how do you close that gap? 
P: 
Regulate. You have to regulate it, or you have to educate everybody. Like literally the main focus on the 
senior newsletter should be you could lose everything you’ve worked for if you hire, you know, Joe Schmo off 
Craig’s List to come and take care of you. 
I: 
So, when you say educate everybody, you mean educate the whole public, all of the legislators, the 
workers? 
P: 
Yeah. Everybody. I think everybody. I think it has to go down [laughing] down the line— 
I: 
[inaudible] 
P: 
Everybody [17.41] because you don’t—I mean I was God-smacked when I found this out. I mean my—I 
mean we don’t have a lot, but what we have is precious to us, so mother’s property, and the property that’s 
been in my grandparents and my great grandparents, and all this stuff. I mean it’s not—I mean it’s like—what 
do they call that, house poor? I mean we’ve got this beautiful property, but it’s worth a lotta money, and if 
somebody was to hurt themselves, that could be gone. They could make us liquidate it. You know, a court 
could say, “Nope. You put this person in this home, and you knew the risks, and you did it anyways, and you 
did not make sure that there was, you know, property liability insurance. 
I: 
Well, so let me understand what you’re saying, though. What kind of regulations are we talking about? 
You’re talking about regulating the profession so that the workers have to be either a contract worker or have 
to have a certain level of training or— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
But regulate the profession itself? 
P: 
Yes. I think so. 
I: 
With liability— 
P: 
Yeah. Liability insurance, and just you’re basic needs because some of the people that are thinking, 
“Oh, this is great. I make $15-$20 an hour, and I take care of three people a week, and I can make my bills.” 
They don’t understand that you have no backup on that. There’s no—there’s no health insurance, there’s no 
retirement possibility, there’s no any of that. 
I: 
So, it puts the worker at risk? 
P: 
Yes. I mean as of right now, positive. You know what  I mean like, oh, yeah. I can do my 1099, and I 
don’t have to pay taxes ‘til the end of the year or whatever, but some may not be educated enough to realize 
that they’re gonna pay taxes, that all of a sudden at the end of the year you’ve gotta come up with $3,000 
because you did so well this year, you know, and are you prepared for that? 
I: 
So, from the private workers standpoint, it’s not illegal. They’re not doing anything illegal? 
P: 
No. 
I: 
But they’re putting themselves at great risk? 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
18
P: 
Absolutely. 
I: 
Of being sued or of having no health insurance. 
P: 
Right.  
I: 
As long as they’re paying the taxes, they’re doin’ things legally. 
P: 
And in situations where you get, you know, even like workman’s comp, okay, so if you’re a private 
person, there’s no workmen’s comp, so you would have to go through the lawsuit process to get compensated 
for missing work because you were injured in a home [14.51]. I mean that’s a long process before you see any 
kind of money. I mean it can happen, sure. You so the—they get their homeowner’s insurance, and you have 
to go through this route, but they’ve got up to 3 years for a lawsuit, and most people with money are gonna 
hand it over to a lawyer who’s gonna purposely prolong it as long as possible because your worker is making 
$15 an hour—has no education, lives in a trailer down the road, and isn’t gonna look at them as a threat. So, 
they’re gonna push off, and they’re gonna play paper games, and meanwhile that person is starving because 
they can’t work, they’re in a situation where they can’t, you know, maybe they can file for assistance or 
emergency relief, but all of that takes time. They’re just not protected. 
I: 
There is so much I wanna ask you right now [group laughter], but once again, we’re almost outta time, 
and I wanna—I mean you’ve already said very well a lot of the things I think that you wanna tell the world, but 
in the last few minutes, how do we fix all of this? What do you wanna say to the policymakers? If I was the 
president—well, let’s not pick the president [group laughter]. If I was the Governor sittin’ here, and had, you 
know, some power over changing this whole situation so that we didn’t have this critical shortage of workers, 
that we could entice people into the field, and they would wanna stay in the field because they’d be makin’ a 
living wage or whatever, what do you wanna tell people? 
P: 
Well, that, number one, it has to be a livable wage. You know, I [laughs] I sketched out for myself a 
value-stream map—something I’m familiar with because I worked automotive—I worked engineering, and to 
have added value at every step, so in this value stream is that—what we need to do is—the way to entice 
somebody is you can’t tell somebody in high school, hey! Be a PCA. Your maximum wage is gonna be like $13 
an hour for the rest of your life. You can’t entice anybody to go into that field with that kind of, you know. I 
mean I wouldn’t have even done that [laughing], you know what I mean. Like, oh, yeah, Yay! $12. Yeah! So, 
what you should do is—and I looked at it as like the nursing industry. Nursing assistants get paid a chunk of 
wage as being a starting job, and then you can go back for a little bit more education and you can get an LPN, 
which gives you a different pay rate, and then you can go back to school, get a little more education because 
now you’re really into it. “Wow. I really wanna do this. I wanna help people. I wanna be a nurse. I’m gonna be a 
real nurse. I wanna be an RN.” So, you go back to school, you get a little more education, and that puts you in 
a different pay bracket. So, they’re added value at every step of that process, and in some way, we need to 
find that for this field. We have to find a situation where you can—a kid who maybe struggles with dyslexia, 
maybe isn’t a great student can get a certificate out of high school to start and be a PCA.  Okay. Yeah. This is 
great, but there has to be that next leap. So, with more education there should be a higher level of a PCA, 
somebody who has more maybe medical background, maybe some more training with other maybe equipment 
or people with special needs like tracks or catheters or things like that, and make that a benefit there, and then 
have a bigger benefit that would be more going into administration, kinda like what I do. I’m doing more of the 
administration part of the job, and that would be learning how to deal with long-term disability insurance claims, 
dealing with payroll, QuickBooks, all those things that makes it a little more where you could work for an 
agency, so you have to show this value stream of where every step has added value to get people into the 
field, and that has to also be equal with lots of payment of what you can make. I also thought about if there was 
a way to be a certified home health aide with a certification that would allow you to do private pay then, but 
legislative you’re now allowed—here’s your card. You can do private pay. Now, you’re eligible to make $25 an 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
19
hour. But you have to have that education [9.46] to get that $25 an hour. Instead of just putting an ad on 
Craig’s List and charging somebody $25 an hour to come into their home with no education and no 
background. So that information of when I go to an interview with a family—bam! Here’s my card. Bam! Here’s 
my liability insurance. Bam! This is my credentials, and I’m worth $25 an hour. That’s how it has to go, but I 
don’t know how to, you know, make that happen, but that’s the value stream that I put in my mind to where 
there’s—the only way you’re gonna get somebody in high school to say, “Yeah. I wanna be. I really love 
working with elder people, and boy I took care of my Grandma, and you know, I would curl her hair every day, 
and I would—and she’d light up when she saw me when I walked into the door,” and those kinda feelings, and 
those kinda people we want, but how do you make that worth it to them? You know, and we’re lookin’ at people 
that most of the CNAs, most of the people who start out in those kind of trades, they don’t look at it as the end. 
This isn’t my career. This is the beginning. This is my step in the door without having to just go and—maybe 
they have kids. Maybe they’re you know—they have challenges, so they can’t. They don’t have the money to 
just go into a 4-year college and get an RN degree right off the bat. So, they have to work while they’re going 
through the process of getting that paper. But, yeah. I think there should be a—I don’t—I hate laws, but there 
should be [laughing] a way that the only way you could do private duty is once you have the credentials to be 
able to be a private duty person. 
I2: 
One second. 
P: 
Sure. 
I2: 
Let’s stop there. That’s 30 minutes, but wanna continue? 
I: 
Uh-huh. 
P: 
What time is it? 
I: 
Well, we’re gonna have to actually—what time is it? Yeah. We’ll stop. I just wanna ask you. 
I2: 
This is not going right now. 
I: 
Okay. 
I2: 
Okay. It’s going now. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
Just one last question. Is there anything that you’re dying to say that you haven’t said? 
P: 
Wow. No, I don’t think. I think I said it all. I mean I’ve said everything. I think it’s an important field. I 
think it’s needed in our community. I mean, what, the boomers are retiring like 60,000 every day or some crazy 
number, and I think people should be able to make good choices and stay in their home. And that should be 
something attainable for everybody regardless what you saved or [6.57] how much you saved or anything like 
that, and I don’t think that the quality of care should be compromised because of your ability to pay. 
I: 
Well, those are great words to end on, and I would love to keep this interview going, but we’re gonna 
get out of time, and you have some great photography to do. 
P: 
Oh, okay. All right. 
I: 
I’m gonna clear out and let him do his thing. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
But you did great! 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018

P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
And I just wanna say thank you again. 
P: 
You’re welcome. 
I: 
For the interview, but also for the important work that you’re doing. 
P: 
Oh, you’re welcome. 
I: 
And I think it’s—we both feel it’s a privilege to talk with you. 
P: 
Well, thank you. No, I’m glad you guys came. I’m glad I said yes, ‘cause I was all like, oh, god. Do I 
wanna do this [laughs]. 
I: 
I’m glad you said yes, so glad you said yes. 
I2: 
Your perspective on a solution quote/unquote, was unique compared to a lot of people we’ve talked to, 
and I don’t know if you agree, C, but— 
I: 
Absolutely, yes. 
I2: 
But I loved that you have a business side—business perspective and a solutions from that side, and 
also from education, and from how people make career choices because typically when we talk to caretakers 
they emphasize that it’s really important, and how—like from their perspective. But you had this holistic, global 
perspective on like how people—PCAs fit in, so thank you so much for that. That is something that I’ve been 
looking for this whole project. 
P: 
[Laughing] well, you are welcome. But, yeah, I think that has more to do with my engineering 
background. 
I: 
And you know, I would love—actually if you don’t—if you’re open to this idea, love to talk with you a 
little more about the ideas you just raised. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No. I totally—I’ve got—I always—I have a pad of paper around me at all times, and I’m 
always jotting down things. 
I: 
You’ve heard me talk in the IMPART meetings [4.31] about, you know, some of the things we wanna to 
including starting a PCA Association, and  one of the goals for doing that is to professionalize it more. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
To have some professional standards and credentials, and you had some, as K said, a unique 
perspective in terms of ensuring that the private duty PCAs have to adhere to the same standards. 
P: 
Absolutely. Yes. 
I: 
Not just the ones that are going through an agency. 
P: 
Yup. 
I: 
So, but we really need that business perspective and these new business models, and I think to start 
that PCA Association, I wanna—I need help. I need people who kind of have some really good ideas on how to 
make this happen, and what the end product should be, right? 
P: 
Right. What it should look like. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Wendy Martin. TC. 6.6.18 
21
I: 
Right. And it should come from the PCA world instead of somebody on the outside dictating, you know, 
what’s going on because you’re the one that understands this world. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
So, if you would be interested in just brainstorming sometime. 
P: 
Absolutely. I have no problem with that.  
I: 
That would be wonderful. 
P: 
Absolutely. I just to do value-stream mapping for the plants. When I was working in manufacturing was 
right during a lean manufacturing—when lean manufacturing started in, and what we had to do was we had to 
streamline, you know, so we had to look at every step in that assembly line and have added value at every 
step. And what we found is that we had so much waste. I mean unbelievable steps that could have been done 
and by one person—we had three people doing it [2.37]. 
I: 
Yeah. 
P: 
You know what I mean? Like, yeah. 
I: 
Yeah. That’s where you start to isolate things, right. 
P: 
Yeah. So, you have to look at—ID, construct situations and scenarios differently because I had to—that 
was like one of main jobs was to make sure that—I mean the people—it was terrible because we laid people 
off. I knew these people were gonna lose their jobs, but in order for the business to continue we had to 
streamline. But I think the good part about that is that you do everything that you do should have added value 
at every step. 
I: 
Well, I like the idea of sitting down with you and trying to deconstruct this particular problem. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And then figure out, okay, what is the value added at each point. 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
You know, I did get a grant—I’m gonna let him do his thing. We did just get a new grant to—it’s a 
planning grant, so we have a year to plan for a high-school PCA tech program. We’re working with the Grand 
Ledge School District to do this. 
P: 
Yeah. I thought I saw something like that. Yeah. I did. Why is it way down in Grand Ledge? 
I: 
Because that’s where I live [group laughter], and I know the school superintendent [laughing]. That’s 
why. 
P: 
No, it’s an inside joke because my whole career from the time I graduated high school—I mean not high 
school, college—well, not really graduated, but when [laughing – inaudible – microphone dropped] but from 
when I left college to where I am now it’s all been I’m—you’re at the right place, but at the wrong time. And now 
I can say I’m at the wrong place at the right time, because I lived in Lansing for 15 years. I worked for Spartan 
Chassis down in Charlotte. I worked for Demmer on the north side of Lansing. Yeah. I was down there, and 
now it’s like, “Oh, yeah. We’re having this training for 3 days in Lansing, and we’re having [laughing].” 
I: 
I know. One of the things we have to do is figure out how to make it more mobile. 
P: 
[Laughing]

Seriously. 
P: 
I told my husband, I was like, yeah. I’m gonna go to Lansing for 3 days for some training. He’s like, 
“What?” I was like, yeah. 
I: 
It is one of our goals to get it more mobile. 
P: 
[Laughing] 
I: 
You know, figure out how to bring to the people. 
P: 
Yeah.
