September 3, 1943, letter from B.A. Botkin to H.M. Bond
September 3, 1943 Dr. Horace M. Bond, President The Fort Valley State College Fort
Valley, Georgia
Dear Dr. Bond:
We have received from Dr. Willis Laurence James 15 recordings which he made while he
was visiting professor this summer. Duplicates of these are being made for your collection.
Since we are ready to close the project, we are endeavoring to locate a number of blank
disks and cutting needles still unaccounted for. According to Dr. James, he has no
knowledge of any but the disks and needles which we sent him and which he has cleared
with us. Our original budget provided for 50 12-inch disks and 4 sapphire cutting needles
for the use of Lewis Jones in March. As we have received only 8 completed recordings,
there are still a number of blank disks and needles to be returned. We should appreciate it
very much if you would look into this matter at once.
May we thank you for your cooperation and for the many excellent recordings that you
have helped add to the Archive of American Folk Song.
With best wishes,
Sincerely yours, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
