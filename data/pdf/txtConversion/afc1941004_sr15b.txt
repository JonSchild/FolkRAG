John Henry Faulk: Mr. Jirosik, what do you think about the implications of Mr. Roosevelt's declaration
yesterday? Or his resolution to declare war? Do you think it involves Germany and Italy?
Joe Jirosik: I do.
John Henry Faulk: In other words, we've got a real world war on our hands.
Joe Jirosik: I think this is going to be a real one.
John Henry Faulk: What do you think about it Mrs. Jirosik, you've got a boy that's going aren't you?
Mrs. Jirosik: Yes.
John Henry Faulk: Well what do you think about this war? Are you for it or against it?
Mrs. Jirosik: Well, I'm for it.
John Henry Faulk: You're ready to see him go, huh?
Mrs. Jirosik: They've got to fight.
John Henry Faulk: Why, why do you think they have to fight?
Mrs. Jirosik: Well, they've been attacked so they've got to fight.
John Henry Faulk: You are behind the war effort, in other words.
Mrs. Jirosik: Yes.
John Henry Faulk: One hundred percent behind Mr. Roosevelt?
Mrs. Jirosik: Yes I am.
John Henry Faulk: Good for you. Mr. Jirosik, have you got any ideas as to which way this war is likely
to spread? Do you know where the fighting is going to be? Where do you think the fighting is going to
be?

Joe Jirosik: Well, as far as Japan's concerned I think most of it will be right there in Manila Bay and up
in there.
John Henry Faulk: Mm, hmm [affirmative]. Reckon they're going to attack the United States?
Joe Jirosik: I don't think so. They might, but it won't amount to anything much.
John Henry Faulk: You reckon they will Mrs. Jirosik?
Mrs. Jirosik: I just don't know.
John Henry Faulk: Well, are you willing to see your son leave the United States to fight?
Mrs. Jirosik: It'd be better to leave, why —
John Henry Faulk: [laughs] Well, yeah, they wouldn't stay at home by himself.
Mrs. Jirosik: It's all right ??? leave too [laughter].
John Henry Faulk: In other words, you believe that an American Expeditionary Force, that is, a force
of soldiers fighting somewhere else is all right?
Mrs. Jirosik: I don't believe in it, unless they have to do it, but if they have to do it why it will have to
be done.
John Henry Faulk: Well what — just Mr. Jirosik I'd like to ask you now if you can sum it up, just what
do you think we're fighting for?
Joe Jirosik: Well, we are fighting those greedy dictators, it's a greedy game that they try to make.
They're trying to take stuffs that don't belong to them.
John Henry Faulk: Who does it belong to?
Joe Jirosik: Well, rightfully just like Czechoslovakia belongs to Czechoslovakia. Poland belongs to
Poland. Holland belongs to Holland, but Hitler's took it all.
John Henry Faulk: Who does Thailand belong to? That's what they're going to fight over. The Dutch
East Indies. They're right stirred up over that, you see?

Joe Jirosik: Well, it surely doesn't belong to the Japanese.
John Henry Faulk: Well, do you think it belongs to the United States? I'm just asking you, you know,
because after all we've got to have some principles to fight for.
Joe Jirosik: Well, I think the United States has got all the principles to fight for. Japan has —
John Henry Faulk: In other words, ??? they're definitely trying to preserve the right kind of life.
Joe Jirosik: That's right.
John Henry Faulk: And . . . what do you think about the United States? Do you think it is the land of
liberty?
Joe Jirosik: I think so.
John Henry Faulk: What about —
Joe Jirosik: It's the best country under the sun.
John Henry Faulk: Well what do you think about it, Mrs. Jirosik?
Mrs. Jirosik: Well, I think it is now and I think that's the reason we've got to fight to keep it that way.
John Henry Faulk: And do you think by war they'll be able to keep it that way?
Mrs. Jirosik: Yes, because I believe they're going to win the war.
John Henry Faulk: They are. Even if it cost your son, you are willing to see him go in?
Mrs. Jirosik: Yes. Well the country wouldn't be any good if we let them have it.
John Henry Faulk: That's right. Well, that takes a whole lot of nerve to say that, especially when you
ain't just hypothetisizing.
Joe Jirosik: I've got a son in the army.
John Henry Faulk: Oh, ???
Joe Jirosik: He served three years and they called him back, he's been back about a year now.
"Man-on-the-Street", Austin, Texas, December 9, 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941004_sr15
Mrs. Jirosik: In the reserves.
John Henry Faulk: Well, he'll go on active duty now.
Joe Jirosik: Wherever he's needed, he's ready to go and I'm willing for him to go.
John Henry Faulk: Well, I think that's a very fine sentiment. But it takes take a lot of nerve to say
that ???
Joe Jirosik: I'd like to go, but they wouldn't have me. My age would bar me.
John Henry Faulk: You'd go though?
Joe Jirosik: I'd go.
John Henry Faulk: The laboring men that you know, the union men that you know here in Austin, do
you think that's the general opinion amongst them? They would all go —
Joe Jirosik: Well, I believe the majority of them would go. But you'll always find men that would rather
stay at home than anywhere else.
John Henry Faulk: Especially when a war is going on anywhere else.
Joe Jirosik: That's right.
John Henry Faulk: Well, Mrs. Jirosik, how long do you look to this war to last?
Mrs. Jirosik: I think three or four years.
John Henry Faulk: It's going to be stretched out all the way around the globe —
Mrs. Jirosik: I think so.
Joe Jirosik: It will finish up sometime in '46.
John Henry Faulk: How come ??? '46?
Joe Jirosik: That's my honest opinion of it.
John Henry Faulk: Yeah, but that's five years though, man.
"Man-on-the-Street", Austin, Texas, December 9, 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941004_sr15
Joe Jirosik: Mm, hmm [affirmative]. ???.
John Henry Faulk: You think the world will be fighting that long.
Joe Jirosik: Oh yes.
John Henry Faulk: What are they going to do for manpower?
Joe Jirosik: Well —
Mrs. Jirosik: Raising more.
John Henry Faulk: They ain't raising them that fast.
Joe Jirosik: Well, that's my honest opinion. I believe it will go that long.
John Henry Faulk: Five years. Well, what do you think, what kind of peace do you think we ought to
write after the war? I mean, say we win.
Joe Jirosik: We're going to win the war, there's no question about that.
John Henry Faulk: You know that?
Joe Jirosik: The United States is going to win the war.
John Henry Faulk: Well, what kind of peace do you think we ought to make with Japan, Italy,
Germany?
Joe Jirosik: Well, of course that would be my honest opinion, you know. I think they ought to set up a
different form of government over there.
John Henry Faulk: Mm, hmm [affirmative]. Should we give them any power to govern themselves at
all?
Joe Jirosik: Well barely. I think they ought to do away with certain countries and do away with the
tongue.
John Henry Faulk: One of them is German, huh?
"Man-on-the-Street", Austin, Texas, December 9, 1941 http://www.loc.gov/item/afc1941004_sr15
Joe Jirosik: One's German. Don't let them speak it anymore. Divide Germany into other little
countries say and give each one of them a slice of it and do away with it.
John Henry Faulk: What about it Mrs. Jirosik? What do you think about it?
Mrs. Jirosik: Well, I think there shouldn't be any Germany anymore. I think they've caused enough
trouble. I think when they whip them they ought to not have Germany any more.
John Henry Faulk: Do you think that Germany's the cause of all this trouble?
Mrs. Jirosik: I do.
John Henry Faulk: Mm, hmm [affirmative]. Well, it's very probable. Well, why do you dislike the
Germans, I'd like to know just frankly why you do ??? —
Mrs. Jirosik: I don't dislike the German people. I know a lot of German people that I don't dislike, but
I remember in the World War that was before the way the thing went. And my children's daddy died
from [mistakes (?)] of the World War and now I've got a boy that's got to go and Germany's the cause
of the whole thing, and I just think that Germany's caused enough trouble that we don't need again.
John Henry Faulk: Is that the way you feel about it Mr. Jirosik?
Joe Jirosik: Exactly. I think that they ought to do away with that one country.
John Henry Faulk: But Japan maybe let them go on being ???.
Joe Jirosik: I don't think there's going to be much to Japan after this war [laughter].
John Henry Faulk: ???
Joe Jirosik: I think the Chinks is whipping them.
John Henry Faulk: [laughs].
