business and Steve knew sales and marketing, making for a good partnership.

Interest in Industry: The Pickards were friends of Steve's wife's parents.  Steve had 
worked in a company that was part of the Book Manufacturers Institute and knew

him to express interest in purchasing the Library Bindery Company.

component of their products.

feet that they outgrew within 2 years.  Moved to industrial park 12 miles from the

facility in Baltimore, Maryland when they merged with Joseph Ruzicka.  Industrial park 
location had higher ceilings, better lighting, and a better layout.

Employees: Relationships with employees important, recognized them as people and 
individuals aside from being workers.

Changes in Business over Time: Industry with 50 outfits now only about 15 companies.  
Competition changed the industry, offering better service and prices for libraries, but not 
all companies could meet those requirements and stay profitable.  $70-$100 million 
revenue industry at one time now down to $28 million, and one company has about $20 
million of that business.  Shrinking library binding budgets led to increased competition. 
 
 
00:34:52 
Interesting Projects: Acquisition of other companies, moving the business and 
integrating companies, the automated binding slip.  Tremendous satisfaction derived from 
work with Library Binding Institute.

number of rebound volumes, kickstarting the business as they acquired it.

budgets.
