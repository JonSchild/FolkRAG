Field Notes 
Pre-Interview 
We arranged to meet at Ryan’s parent’s house up here in Lewiston, after work, as that’s where he works 
on his car two or three times a week. Ryan grew up in Lewiston but lives in the Buffalo area now, and 
works out in West Seneca, so it’s a bit of a hike after work from West Seneca (southeast of Buffalo) to 
his parent’s house. We agreed to meet around 6:30, as that’d give me time to get off work, eat, walk the 
dog and pop over from the village (of Lewiston) out to the town part bordering Ransomville (about a 7-
10 minute drive). Ryan texted earlier in the day to confirm I was able to make it out that day, and I 
confirmed I’ll be there.  
After getting off work and taking care of the dog and house stuff, I set out around 6, heading east out of 
the village on 104 and turning left once I hit Ransomville road, keeping an eye out for their house 
number. As with some areas of Niagara County, cell service can be pretty spotty at times (or if driving/ 
along the niagara river, you also always get switched to the Canadian towers) – and on Ransomville 
Road in between Lewiston and Ransomville turned out to be one of those areas. The house did sneak up 
on me a bit but I was able to slow down in time and turn into their driveway, pulling round the side, and 
after I gave Ryan a text headsup that I was there, got out and got my gear. Ryan greeted me at the side 
and we chatted for a little about the heatwave that’s hitting us (though not nearly as bad as elsewhere), 
his parent’s house (his childhood home) and the woods and fields behind it, before we settled on doing 
the interview outside on the patio as the weather was really nice out and we both were working at 
desks for most of the day.   
After talking about the interview process some more and the weather, we got started. 
Interview 
During the interview, Ryan started out by speaking about his early memories and experiences with 
racing, starting with going alongside his father to the track. Ryan mentioned that his dad started later 
than most when they got involved with racing, as he figured his dad was in his late 30s-40s when he 
started racing at Ransomville (in the Pro Stock) division. Ryan then shared a memory about his first time 
ever behind a wheel, and how he got hooked, and then when he decided to get his start with racing mini 
stocks once he turned 17. A few minutes into the interview however, as is somewhat common for the 
area, a sudden gust of wind and storm blew in off the lake with little warning, knocking over our setup in 
the back (though I was able to catch the tripod holding the audio recorder with my foot and hand). One 
of the things you get used to here though is the weather can change without warning in moments (and a 
really intense storm might last only for a few minutes), especially in the summer. After taking a look at 
the sky, we decided to move onto the covered deck.  
After relocating and resuming the interview, Ryan continued to talk about the mini-stock or 4 banger 
class, how it differed from the enduro class, and the type of work and maintenance that goes into the 
mini stock, including fabricating roll cages for it, going to get parts at junkyards and other cars, and the 
safety equipment. Ryan shared how one of the big changes in the class over the years is how it went 
from many different brands of cars and models to now most drivers at Ransomville running Chevy: but 
at other tracks he said for whatever reason, you have other types of cars that tend to be more popular 
at them. Ryan still runs a cavalier and shares that one of the difficulties of it at this point is finding the 
parts for it – as the cavalier line got replaced by the chevy cobalt.   
Ryan talked about working on the car and coordinating with his dad, similar to how when his dad was 
racing that his dad helped him out on his car. Ryan also talked the difficulties of racing on Friday night 
and working out in West Seneca, and how that affects their preparation especially when there’s traffic: 
that sometimes he won’t get to the track or up in the area until 6 or past 6 depending on traffic, so he’ll 
have to call his dad to head to the track and he’ll race to meet him there. Ryan joked that this was the 
‘race before the race’: just getting up there to be on time.  
Ryan spoke at length in the interview about the camaraderie and community connected to the 4 banger 
and mini stock group of drivers too, talking about the type of advice and help that everyone gives one 
another, and the joy in racing and having a good battle against someone: and the enjoyment he gets out 
of racing. Ryan talked about the role that the smaller purse size (i.e. amount you’d win for a race) has 
also sometimes in decisions made on the track re: how hard to push a car and the strategy in racing for 
points. 
Towards the end of the interview, Ryan reflected on some bad wrecks he had been involved in, including 
one with Steve Matson (April’s husband), who got the brunt of it. In closing, Ryan talked about how he 
got the nickname ‘Mr. Peanut’, as Planter’s was a nickname he had from school and just kind of ran with 
it: and put a Mr. Peanut on his car (the mascot for Planter’s Peanuts), and how it became his nickname 
at the Speedway thanks to Dave Buchanan (one of the announcers at the track).  
Post Interview 
After the interview, Ryan and I chatted for a bit more on his parent’s deck, as he shared one of the 
weirdest wrecks he remembers happening with someone going off the guardrail of a track: I jumped in 
as I told him I remembered hearing the story from Rick Mooney about that incident. Ryan added that 
that same driver ended up rolling the next week and then as they were already pretty up there in age, 
decided to retire from racing. Then we talked a bit about Lewiston and our families, and the upcoming 
exhibit we’ll be organizing at the Castellani. After some more chatting I said my goodbyes and set out on 
the short drive back home.
