Ahen  kapa was  generaliy  used  by  the  natives,
 they  took
 
great
 pains
 to
 stamp  it with  bright
 colors
 and
 a  great
 
variety
 of
 f
igures,
 but,
 I presume  there  is
 very
 l
ittle
 
stamping  done  now.
 I
t  took  some  t
i me  to  f
igure  a whole  sheet
 
with
 such  a l
ittle  stick  as  I send  you,
 nevertheless  it was
 
done,
 and  they were exceedingly  proud of  their  gay malos  and
 
paus
 (
loin  cloths  and  skirts)  for  a considerable  ti me
 after
 
we
 came  here,
 the  latter,
 worn  by  the  females,
 went

The c
loth of Polynesia was made out  of  the  i
nner bark of
 
the
 wauke or paper mulberry plant.
 In Hawaii  i
t  i
s
 called
 
kapa,
 and  was made by the women.
 The quality of
 Hawaiian
 
kapa  i
s considered  to be  the best  in Polynesia.
 
The
 process
 of  making
 this
 fabric  was
 very
 t
ime
 
consuming.
 Only  the  inner bark of  the plant was used.
 After
 
the
 i
nner
 bark  was  separated  f
rom the outer
 bark
 i
t
 was
 
washed and softened  i
n sea water.
 The bark was  then beaten,
 
f
irst
 with a round beater  to  form strips
 of
 cloth.
 These
 
s
trips
 were
 then soaked  in water and softened,
 and
 beaten
 
together
 to
 form l
arge rectangles.
 The  l
arge p
ieces
 were
 
dried  i
n  the sun and bleached.

Pieces
 of kapa  that have been designed with  'ohe ka-pala
 
have some common characteristics.
 The Hawaiian people  were
 
able
 to
 adopt  patterns  they had seen  in western clothes
 to
 
their
 fabrics.
 The  Hawaiians were also
 known
 for
 their
 
designs
 that
 contained
 hidden  meaning--kaona--or
 played
 
tricks
 on
 the eye.
 Looking at  a piece of
 fabric
 i
t
 was
 
sometimes
 d
ifficult
 to  tell whether  the stamped design  was
 
the  foreground or  the background.
 The colors most
 commonly
 
used were b
lack and/or  reddish brown.
 
The  Hawaiian
 people
 used
 kapa  mainly
 for
 garments
 
i
ncluding  the pa'u,
 k
i7hei  and  the m515.
 The  fabric was  also
 
used as bed covers or sheets.
 With  the arrival  of  travellers
 
f
rom
 the west  as well  as  the missionaries,
 the use of
 kapa
 
quickly
 d
isappeared.
 In  less  than a century after  Captain
 
Cook's
 arrival  i
n Hawaii  the manufacture--of bark cloth

An e

f t

sked f
or
 
and r
eceived. At f

The Folk & T

g
ranted.
 
I

 was decided t

everal

eem i
solated, i
t
s s
i
tu-
a
tion was quite advanced c
ompared t
o
 
Swain's. T
ransportation t
o Swain's was
 
"
iffy" and e
xpensive, l
argely dependent
 
on whether t
he Tokelau s

t
here were normally two Twin Otter

Whereas t
