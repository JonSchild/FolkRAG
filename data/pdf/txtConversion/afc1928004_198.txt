WE TARE 'EM IN. 
Am —" 
Gens d'Armes Duet." 
Tw.) policemen on the beat are we, 
Dressed in nice warm winter clothes. 
And we're strictly temperate, you see, 
You can tell it by our nose. 
We watch little boys upon the street, 
And when they to fight begin, 
We take ' em in, (Repeat twice.) 
For they are not strong, you know, 
We take '
em in, (Repeat twice.) 
But the big rascals we let go. 
Woodhull and Cladin good folks condemn, 
For they've blood upon the brain ; 
But, Gorge Francis Train, be comforts them 
And keeps them on good champagne. 
Now if they get out and come to us, 
And wash them of their sin, 
We'll take em in, (Repeat twice.) 
And show them something funny; 
We'll take 'em in, (Repeat twice.) 
And we don't want any blood- money. 
We are much obliged for your applause, 
And we're glad you like our song ; 
But our voices are about used up because 
Our throats are not very strong. 
Some other night when you come this way, 
With your pockets full of tin, 
We'll take you in ; (Repeat Twice.) 
So you should let us off, we think: 
We must away, 
We cannot stay, 
We must obey, 
Our orders say 
That we must go and take a 
drink. 
OLD SIWOZER BEN. 
Fyn been walking around this big city, 
I'm so tired I 
scarcely can jog, 
I 
was hoping some friend would take pity, 
And treat me to one glass of grog. 
Whenever I 
go in a 
gin mill, 
They order nie out there and then, 
And say that I'm drunk and had my fill, 
And they've nicknamed me Old Snoozer Ben. 
Once I 
was in good circumstances, 
And had hosts of friends among men, 
But I 
lost all by taking the chances, 
And bad luck struck Old Snoozer Ben. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
I'm looking for some friends to come, 
It's provoking— I'm choking, 
I'm shaking for one glass of rum. 
When I 
was a 
respectable body, 
Then friends would meet me at the door, 
And insist on my having a 
toddy, 
But they never do so any more, 
They helped me to spend all my money, 
As they had many poor fools they meet. 
But now.a-days they all think it funny, 
To help boot me out in the street.

OLD SNOOZER BEN.—Continued. 
But yet it's the way of the times now, 
I've noticed it time and again, 
If a 
man's down and ain't any dimes now, 
He's as bad off as Old Snoozer Ben. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
In hopes that some old friend I'd meet, 
Only think now— one drink now, 
Can I 
find no friend that will stand treat ? 
I 
feel that I'm fast growing weaker, 
If only I 
had just a 
drop. 
My poor wife, oh! how can I 
seek her 7 
Oh rum— rum, oh! why can't I 
stop ? 
What figures are those that are near me, 
It's the forms of my poor wife and child, 
They are starving at home—oh ! dear me, 
Give me brandy or I 
shall go wild. 
But no, I 
must banish this madness, 
And try to be a 
man among men, 
Our hearts filled with joy and with gladness, 
I 
never will get drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
must bear it—I 
swear it, 
No liquor for me e'er again, 
No shrinking— or drinking, 
So pattern from Old Snoozer Ben.

DON'T SELL MY PAIHIAR RUM. 
A BEAlterirct TESIPErseNcE BALLAD. 
DON'T sell him another drink, please, 
He's reeling already, you see, 
And I 
fear when he comes home to-night 
He'll beat poor mother and me ; 
She's waiting in darkness and cold, 
And dreading to hear him come; 
He treats us so bad when he's drunk, 
Oh ! don't sell him any more rum I 
Don't sell him another drink, please, 
lie's reeling already, you see, 
An 1 
I 
fear when he comes home to-niaht 
he'll beat poor mother and me. 
I 
heard mother praying last night, 
She thought I 
was quite sound asleep, 
She prayed God her husband to save. 
His soul from temptation to keep : 
She cried like her poor heart would break 
So, trying to comfort her some, 
told her I'd beg you to day 
Not to sell father any more rum. 
Don't sell him another, etc. 
Why don't you have something to sell 
That will not make people so sad ; 
That will not make dear mothers grieve, 
And kind fathers cruel and bad 7 
Ali me ! it is hard ; 1 
can see 
You're angry because T 
have come ; 
Forgive a 
poor, sad little girl, 
And don't sell her dear father rum ! 
Don't sell him another, cee. 
MoTHEa, I 
have heard sweet music 
Floating round me as I 
lay, 
Like the songs of angels singing 
From the brieht land, far away ; 
And I 
felt such joy and gladness 
As I 
listened to each strain. 
Mother, do you think they'll ever 
Come and sing to me again ? 
Mother, I 
have heard sweet music 
Floating round me as I 
lay, 
Like the songs of angels singing 
From the bright land, far away; 
Like the songs of angels singing 
From the bright land, far away. 
Mother, I 
have heard sweet music, 
Not like that we sometimes hear ; 
But so full of tender feeling, 
Coming forth so soft and clear. 
As I 
lay so calm and silent 
In the twilight, soft and gray, 
Such a 
mingling of sweet-voices, 
As they came and passed away. 
Mother, I 
have heard, etc. 
Mother, I 
have heard sweet music 
That would melt the hardest heart, 
And to the tired and weary worn 
Would a 
soothing balm impart; 
And I 
felt such joy and gladness 
As I 
listened to each strain ; 
Mother, do you think they'll ever 
Come and sing to me again ? 
Mother, I 
have heard, etc.

NOBODY'S TREASURE. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
Tun snow has been falling and lies white in the street, 
And thro' it are wandering those little bare feet, 
With an old torn dress that tries to enfold 
Her shivering form from the merciless cold ; 
She holds out her hand now chill'd with the blast, 
Hoping to find a 
kind word at last; 
But all pass her by, for they all have a 
home, 
Leaving Nobody's treasure to wander alone. 
CHORUS. 
Nobody's treasure, nobody's treasure, 
No one will miss her, or speak words of love. 
Nobody's treasure, no one will miss her, or speak words of 
love. 
Nobody's treasure, Angels bear nobody's treasure above, 
Angels bear nobody's treasure above. 
The storm has been fierce and deserted the street, 
The snow-flakes still fall and are mingled with sleet, 
She sits on a 
doorstep and bitterly cries, 
But the warmth is within and no one replies, 
She whispers a 
pray'r she learned on the knee 
Of one who's dead and from sorrow free; 
She's no one to miss her, and no words of lore, 
So the angels bear nobody's treasure above. 
Nobody's treasure, etc.

WHAT WOULD MEN DO WITHOUT US. 
I'm going to sing you a 
song, 
Not very short or very bug, 
And as to whether right or wrong, 
I'll tell you when I've done, sir. 
It is about the sterner sex 
Who us girls often will perplex 
And tease, defy, deceive and vex, 
And think it very jolly. 
CHORUS. 
Oh you know it's true, 
You can't deny what I 
tell you. 
Poe doat on us, of course you do I 
You could not do without us. 
When little girls, you often please 
To take and dance us on your knees, 
We pull your whiskers and we tease 
You near to desperation; 
But when we have much bigger grown, 
Just like the tender rose full blown, 
! 
don't you wish we were your own, 
You lords of the creation. 
Oh ! you, etc. 
And when we were wed, what jolly fun, 
We then take care of number one, 
Sharp as you are, you're often done, 
You can't deny it, I 
know. 
We do with you just as we will, 
And sometimes treat you very ill, 
But with all our faults you love us still, 
And will for evermore, sir. 
Oh 
you, etc.

M OTHER, Home and Heaven! 
How dear those words to me! 
The first, she held me to her breast, 
And danced me on her knee ; 
I 
was to her a 
priceless gem, 
She thought me nice and fair; 
And now I 
never can forget 
A 
faithful mother's care.

Mother, Home and Heaven! 
How dear to think of all! 
Before the trumpter descends 
To bid us mind his call. 
Mother, Home and Heaven! 
How sweet to me is home! 
For tl:era we meet with those we love, 
And do not care to roam; 
We have a 
pretty sister's voice, 
To cheer us day by day ; 
We have a 
little baby bright, 
To watch while he's at play. 
Mother, home, etc. 
Mother, Home and Heaven ! 
The last we hope to see ! 
Where angels gather ' round the throne, 
And sing a 
joyous glee; 
Oh may we all assemble there, 
And cast our sins aside ; 
For with the true and righteous ones 
Our aim is to abide. 
Mother, home, etc. 
CHICAGO WAS THE QUEEN. 
Written and performed by A NDY lIcKEE, after the " Chicaga tire." 
Ant.—" She's got the money too." 
You may talk about your cities, 
Chicago was the queen, - 
In all the Western country, 
The faire,t ever seen. 
She suffered last October, 
'Twas by the burning flame, 
To build her up the people seem 
To have it on the brain. 
CHORUS. 
Jump high, shake yourself, (Sym.) 
We're the boys to have the wealth, (Sym.) 
Although we've lost our property, 
Our nerve is just the same, 
In one more year you'll 
See we'll have our Chicago back again. 
Now just before I 
leave you, 
To the ladies I 
would say, 
If my song has pleased you, 
Just cast a 
smile this way, 
For I'm about to go away, 
And bid you all good bye; 
You'll know me when you see 
By my dark bewitching eye 
Jump high, etc.

SADDLE ROCK OYSTERS. 
I WAS as happy as a 
Saddle Rock oyster, 
What's made up in a 
stew, 
And as merry as quail on toast, 
The reason I 
will tell unto you— 
I'm a 
going to see my little Katrina, 
Mit her I 
am in love, 
She's as pretty as a 
big sunflower, 
And as fascinating as a 
turtle dove. 
We met, ' twas in the Bowery, 
On a 
Saturday afternoon, 
The weather it was showery, 
So we stepped into a 
lager bier saloon ; 
It was there we told our tales of love, 
She said she would be mine, 
I 
was a 
happy little Dutchman then, 
As ever came from Bingen on the Rhine. 
You talk about your fascinating Dutchmen, 
Now just observe my style, 
Mit dis hand-me-down coat of mine, 
I 
wear dot all the while ; 
Da ladies dey are all in love mit me, 
Whenever I 
go out, 
Dey wink and make dere eye dot way, 
My gracious, I 
don't knbw what I'm about. 
On Broadway I 
was walking 
The other afternoon, 
One pretty girl she passed me by— 
She ros lovely as the flowers in June, 
She wore a 
hat just, three feet high, 
And two curls down her back dat long-
She had buttons all over her dress, 
Just as big as a 
Chinese gong.

NEW END SONG. 
Am.—" Joe Bowers." 
OLD Mother Proctor, she went to the doctor, 
To save the poor dog's health, 
Mary said to her little lamb, 
You know how it is yourself. 
The boy that would a 
wooing go, 
Was in the level ground laid. 
Johnny I 
hardly knew you, 
Since you joined the lunch brigade. 
Repeat last four lines for Chorus. 
Supposen now that I 
was you, 
And supposen you were me, 
Supposen I 
was somebody else, 
I 
wonder whose brother you'd be. 
Oh! put me in my little bed, 
I 
just want forty winks, 
I'm lonely since my mother croaked, 
And so is Captain Jinks. 
Repeat last four lines for Chorus. 
Oh ! Mary had a 
black and tan, 
As white as Pittsburg snow, 
He'd stand on his head for a 
peck of bread, 
And whistle not for Joe. 
Old mother Hubbard she went to the cupboard, 
To draw a 
pail of water, 
When she got there the cupboard was hire, 
And so was the ratcatcher's datu,Th ter. 
Repeat last four 1,nes for Citf.irus.

AN ADDRESS TO AN OLD WOODEN PIPE. 
So they say you're a 
villain, old friend, 
That, you rob me of sleed and of sense, 
To ruin my strength that you tend, 
And walk off with my hardly earn'd pence. 
That you lead to late hours and bad ways, 
And encourage a 
taste for strong drink, 
One friend in particular says, 
Without hesitation you stink ! 
That you are not a 
beauty I 
fear, 
An old blackened tube at the best ; 
Your odor— decidedly queer, 
And you're seldom if ever at rest. 
I 
do take a 
glass when 
smoke, 
Especially after I've dined ; 
And my friends are most welcome to croak 
if it any way eases their mind. 
I 
think I 
with safety may state 
That you have cost me fourpence a 
day ; 
That I 
sometimes have sat up too late 
And smoked you whilst losing at play, 
Still those tourpence I 
well can afford, 
They make no great hole in my purse ; 
And I 
really don't think, on my word, 
That, the smoke made play any worse. 
Of one thing I'm perfectly sure, 
If my temper should follow my pelf, 
My friends from bad words are secure, 
For I 
take it all out on yourself. 
I 
gnaw at your dirty old stem, 
And I 
shut myself in with a 
cloud, 
And until I've recovered my phlegm, 
I 
do not emerge from my shroud. 
You help me bear sorrow and pain, 
You smooth the rough journey of life; 
You stand by me in sunshine and rain 
And you keep me from anger and strife. 
The longest song must have an end, 
Mine has with this simple recipe ; 
If you want to keep terms with a 
friend, 
Don't endeavor to put out his pipe.

HOW THAT POOR GAL SUFFERED FOR -ME. 
Bann) SoLo. 
Now listen to me and a 
story I 
will tell 
Of a 
sad calamity; 
It happened to a 
gal, her name was Sal, 
And dearly she loved me; 
She left her home on my account. 
To cross the raging sea, 
And it almost bursts my heart in two, 
When I 
think how she suffered for me. 
I 
took her out one Sunday afternoon, 
Just for to have a 
lark; 
Says she, my lore, the ball is up, 
We'll go to the Central Park. 
When we got on the ice she went to strike out, 
But the ice being slippery, 
Her heels flew up, she came down ker slap : 
How that gal did suffer for me. 
For seven long years I 
courted her, 
With all my might and main, 
And I 
swore that none should separate me 
From my sweet Mary Jane! 
But it happened one dark and stormy night, 
To an oyster saloon went she, 
Where she choked to death with a 
soft-shell crab, 
Which ended her suffering for me. 
Her nainsel tuked amang her head, 
That she wad herd no more indeed. 
But afr she'd gang an' win her bread 
Amang te Lalan toun, man. 
She'd leave te sheep, to kyes, an' a', 
Te plaiding kilt for trows so braw, 
And aft' she'd gang tru frost an' snaw, 
A' to to Lalan toun, man. 
An' when she'll come, she'll get some wark 
To build a 
braw house 'mang to park ; 
Te name she'll hae's to mason's clark, 
A' tru to Lalan's toun, man. 
But tat shob she'll no like so wee], 
For up to dam stick stairs to spec], 
More lime," tey'll cry, " you lazy sheet !" 
Tat 'ill no gang doun wool wi' her, man. 
Next, she'll go to work up to Clyde, 
To dye te boney crimson plaid 
Te laty wears, wi' meikle pride, 
A' true te had toun, man. 
An' tere she'll stuck as fast's a 
burr. 
Nor from her work she'll never stir; 
If master spoke, she'll aye cry, Sir, 
An' he'll thought her nae bun, man. 
But te lads ter, ta are so dour, 
Tey'll gloom at her so sulk an' sour, 
Shist cas she'll come before her hour, 
Her master for to please, man. 
Ten a 
charge she'll shin got 'mang te house 
To keep te men at wark fu' douse; 
An' vow but she's both big an' crouse, 
An' thought hersel nae bun, man.

Now, she'll dress her so wonderas gran' 
Amang te Coffee-Room te stan', 
To shake to shentlemen by te han';

MUTTON SINGER. 
BANJO SOLO. 
A 
GAY young man you're gazing on, 
Which you can't help but say, sir, 
He fell in love one afternoon, 
With a 
mutton singer gay, sir, 
She's fair, she'. neat, she's beautiful, 
And she's as graceful as a 
mule, 
She came from college with McCook 
This dashing mutton singer. 
Her feet are flat, one ear's bit off; 
She's a 
captivating dame, sir, 
She's crazy and gone off to preach 
Along with Francis Train, sir, 
She's handsome as you may suppose, 
You'll know her by her broken nose, 
It sounds like thunder when it's blow'd, 
Oh ! where's my mutton singer. 
A 
flat boat ride's her chief delight, 
While with another fellow, 
Her coach and four is a 
mule and ea7t, 
Or a 
busted umbrella, 
She colognes her hair with monkey grease, 
Until we're married I'll have no peace, 
Won't some one kill that homely beat, 
This euphonious mutton singer.

BIG LONG JOHN. 
By LUSE SCHO9LCBAFT. 
BIG long John was a 
Chinaman, 
And he lived in the land of the free, 
He peddled cigarettes on the upperland, 
Way out in Milwaukee. 
He could eat more hash than a 
free lunch cadet, 
And he never was late to his meals, 
He wore a 
long tail from the top of his head, 
Which hung way down to his heels. 
CLIORITS. 
Ching, chin:7„ chum, chow ching a 
ring a 
rue, 
Long John was a 
Chinaman, 
He is a 
barber by birth and a 
butcher by trade, 
I 
tell you he oil from the can. 
He went to San Francisco, 
For a 
Chinee gal to see, 
Feeling tired, he laid down to rest 
Beneath the shade of a 
huckleberry tree, 
He feeling very warm soon fell asleep, 
And he laid his head on a 
plank, 
Along came an Indian with a 
big tomahawk, 
And chopped off a 
piece of his scalp. 
Ching, ching, chum, etc 
Now when he awoke he felt so bad, 
That lie hollered with all his might, 
Put his hand to his head and it made him so sick 
That he died that very same night. 
He was found next day about 12 M. 
By the capta:n of a 
How! Kong crew,; 
He wrote to his sweetheart, Chum Chum Fee, 
That he died from the loss of his cue.

At a

A day that I 
ne'er shall forget ; 
We stroll'd thro' the woods and sonic how lost our way, 
And our hearts, which are not found as yet. 
But I 
think I've fouml his, I 
know he has mine. 
Tho' parted now forever more; 
Yet still in my dreams I 
can see his eyes shine. 
And hear his rat-a- tat at the door.

He has not yet proposed, but I 
think he will soon. 
My mirth I've to hide with a

For I

And as oft ii) confusion bloke down. 
Tie hai vowed to be mine, in fact we've both vowed 
Each other to love ever more; 
AL, whrres there a

Whan she heirs her love knock at the door.. 
Oh, how my heart, 4toa.

A. DREAlt OF THE PAST 
By PHIL II. MownEr. 
To Ma. A. F. 
M OWIUM of Philadelphia. 
I 
sit and think of childhood's days 
Long numbered with the past. 
And swiftly back my memory glhles 
To joys too bright to last. 
The old school-house upon the hill, 
Has long gone to decay. 
And the Master. too, so kind and true, 
Lies mouldering in the clay. 
And as I 
sit tne here anti think. 
My thoughts seem in a 
dream. 
Methinks I 
hear the old mill-wheel 
And the murmur of the stren 
The meadows stretching far away, 
And through the mist I 
see 
The little cot where I 
was born 
Beside the old Elin tree. 
Onward still the time cloth glide, 
My childhood's days are o'er; 
The forest and the rolling hills 
I'll see again no more; 
But memory will glide back at times 
Till death elahns me at last, 
Then I 
will bid a 
last farewell 
To Memories of the Past.

Dedicated to Miss. LEO. GORDON, by PHIL. II. 
M OWIZET. 
Serio Comic. 
All in the merry spring Hine, 
We've wandered o'er the hill, 
And plucked the little daisies, 
Along each rippling- rill. 
I 
whispered if thou wert my bride 
I'd be forever blest, 
When in her soft and silvery Yoke 
She said: ".011, give us a 
rest." 
And on one summer's morning, 
As along the brook we strgyed, 
The birds sang out their joyous lay, 
Deep in the kvild-wood shade. 
I 
promised that, through weal or woe, 
I 
ever would prove true; 
When in accents, low and sweet, 
She whispered—“ Cheese it, do!" 
I 
promised that to foreign shores 
We'd go if she'd be mine; 
We'd dwell in Italy's fair land, 
Or in the flowing Rhine. 
Or if she'd wish it, we might dwelt 
Upon some mountain high, 
When, with a 
winning smile, she cried : 
" 
Oh, go lay down and die."

MARRIED ON WEDNESDAY.—[CONCLUDED] 
She's a 
gal what's most dreadfully partikilar, 
Oh! such a 
stickeler, 
Once I 
tried to tickle her, 
She caught me a 
spank right on the auricular, 
"There's time enough for that," says she. 
I 
like her all the better, for I 
wouldn't give a 
cuss 
For a 
gal that goes a 
tickling, and isn't virtuous. 
Oh! fly away time, 
Oh! isn't prime, 
We'll be married on Wednesdee. 
- 
Oh, such a 
duck, drc. 
I 
went over the water, to a 
fortune-teller there, 
Down in a 
cellar there, 
I 
spoke to a 
fellow there, 
I 
knew that the fellar in the cellar would tell her there, 
She'd be married to a 
chap like me. 
He said that she would be my bride, 
And have twelve babies, but she wasn't satisfied; 
So he promised her four more, 
At the least, before 
She'd be married on Wednesdee. 
Oh, such a 
duck, (te. 
I've furnished a 
house as well as I'm able to, 
Chairs and a 
table, too, 
Pump and a 
ladle, too, 
But she made me buy a 
cradle, too, 
To put in the nurserie. 
Ohl ain't 1 
jolly proud of it, above a 
bit—oh, rather! 
Oh, goodness! only fancy that some day I'll be a 
father! 
With such bliss in store, 
I'll bust afore 
rm married on Wednesdee. 
Oh, such a 
duck, dre. 
Now, single chaps, take my advice a 
bit, 
Much better splice a 
bit, 
Do in a 
trice a 
bit, 
It's far more betterer, and much more nice a 
bit, 
Than all by yourself to be. 
Oh, won't I 
think myself a 
first-rater, 
When I 
take the babies for a 
walk in the peramblater; 
It's enough to make a 
man 
Get any gal he can, 
And be married on Wednesdee. 
Oh, such a 
duck, f&c.

With its old oaken doors so strong; 
With the ivy a-creeping around them,

But the friends of ray childhood are gone now, 
And in the gray church-yard they lie.

They've all gone and left Me so lonely 
And the old house it stands there so drear. 
When I 
look back and think of my childhood, 
Down on my cheek rolls a 
tear. 
The old house it stands there so silent ; 
All about it seems lonely and dreary; 
And the green moss upon the old tower 
Has been growing for many a 
year. 
The old oaken windows are hidden ; 
The ivy hangs on them so long; 
The old walls are slowly decaying,

Where I've not been for many a

The roof and the floor is all rotting, 
And swiftly decaying away.

And over the valley and hill ;

Promenade the street.

A style that's plain and neat. 
But when they flash along in silks 
That .1

Give Inc one who dont put on airs 
And she's the girl for me. 
These stylish fashionable girls 
Will ne'er tnalie a

As he who gets one will find out 
He'll rue it all his life. 
The world thinks style is every thing, 
With it I 
can't agree; 
Give me a

And she's the girl for me. 
She's the girl, Ltc. 
Give me a

And not race round the street 
Give me one who can cook a

Quite happy we will be, 
When I

In the days of General Washington, 
Some ninety years ago. 
Old England tried to whip us, 
But they found it was no go. 
Altho' we hadn't many men. 
Of fighting she got her fill. 
And I 
think she never will forget 
That place called Bunker Hill. 
0 then again in 1512, 
She tried it once again, 
For to whip us Yankee boys 
She came across the main 
She met with Hickory Jackson 
Amid he gave her Yankee Beans; 
And I 
likewise think she wont forget 
A place called New Orleans. 
0 then again in '61. 
Another war we had, 
And many once happy firesides 
For evermore are sad. 
For ninny men beneath the sod 
Are lying still and cold ; 
They died defending our starry flag 
And the Union to uphold.

And young Allen-a-dale softly whisper'd love's tale, 
lit the fair Maid Marian's ear, 
While they'd shout and they'd laugh, and they'd play

Or they'd quaff off the berry brown beer.

Can equal the young in metal and noise, 
We fast old boys. we fast old buys,

We keep a

In the parish entitled Sr. James, 
As jay old sparks we are known, 
And every spark has his flame. 
Yes, rather the girls I

As I 
lounge in the " Row" day by day, 
And many, I'm sure, would aspire, 
To marry me, though I 
am grey. [ We fast, ite.

Keep the last old sports alive,

My wine is a

With the best of hounds 1

But, of course, never look at the play, 
There's nothing but scenery shown, 
The drama is gone to decay. 
'Hind the scenes 'mid bustle and dirt,

For the " ballet" all know how to flirt, 
And so do we fast old boys. [ We fast , &c. 
Though old, Pm able to fight, 
That is, I 
can take my own part, 
My limbs are tough and all right, 
And I 
have a 
plucky old heart. 
And thus, with the rest of my set, 
I'm full of fun, rattle, and noise, 
And hail jolly fellows well met. 
Are we rollicking, last old boys. [ We fast, &c.

DOCTOR GREGORY BOLUS SQUILL. 
Written and Composed by C. J. Pavrrr. 
My friends, you see before you now, 
The famous Doctor Squill, 
And he's the boy to give you joy, 
And cure you when you're ill. 
I've cordials got for aching hearts, 
And linitnents for sprains, 
With pills and draughts to give relief 
And ease you of your pains. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm Doctor Gregory Bolus Squill, 
Lotion, potion, powder and pill ; 
I'm the boy that can make you well, 
Whatever you're ills may be. 
I'm greatly skill'd in each disease 
That mortal man can know ; 
From pleurisy upon the brain, 
To dropsy on the toe ; 
At apoplexy of the arm. 
And fits I'm quite a 
whale, 
A 
cataract upon the nose, 
To cure I 
never fail. 
For I'm Doctor, ecc. 
I've ointments, too, and lotions rare, 
To cure a 
pimply tare; 
My tonic strengthens every nerve, 
It's what they give to Mace: 
My patent sedative contains 
An undiscovered gum ; 
Its just the thing for a 
scolding wife, 
And makes her hold her tongue. 
For Fin Doctor, ecc.

DOCTOR GREGORY BOLUS SQUILL.—CONCLUDED. 
• 
My seeds of health are miracles, 
If you be like to die; 
They'll make you strong and juvenile, 
So only come and buy : 
What ca 
t 
be cured, must be endured— 
A pre .rb stale and old,— 
But I 
c I 
cure, so don't endure, 
Whi 
drugs so rare are sold. 
("poken).—J 
Av it was only a 
week ago that a 
smart 
young female came to me and said : " Dr. Squills, dear, 
won't you give me something for my baby, lie's a- teething." 
—" A 
tea-thing," said ; .‘ which is he, a 
cup or a 
saucer?" 
—" Oh ! I 
mean," said she, c 
he's cutting his teeth, and 
he's so cross, won't you give me something to make him 
sleep."—" Of course I 
will, my dear ; here rake a 
bottle of 
my Quietus yrupina, give him a 
tea spoonful every four 
hours. in cold water. 
Stay, you may make it a 
dessert 
spoonful in warm water every two hours. 
Yet. now I 
re-
flect, I 
think the case demands a 
gravy spoonful, in hot 
water every hour. 
Olt ? blow It. give him a 
ladleful in 
boiling water. 
Let him take it every minute.' 
So oft she 
went. 
I've just received this letter from her to tell me 
how her baby is.—Let me see what she says.—(rea4) 
Dear Doctor.—Your Quietus Syrupina was beau-
titul, baby has been asleep ever since he took the 
first dose, but you must please send me a 
certifi-
cate of death, as he died last night by return of 
post. 
I 
knew the case was hopeless from the first; I 
knew by 
the complexion of the mother .:,hat the child couldn't last 
long. 
Internal complications you know. Rupture of the 
" 
spinal glandinus" being accelerated by weakness of the 
" 
coroa-nut fibre" pn.venting it free circulation through the 
" 
gutta pacha tubing." 
Anal so caused a 
contraction of the 
eye brow. which loosened the funuy-bone, and resulted in

derstand me? beyond even the skill of—

[2] 
Written and Composed by A RTHUR LLOYD. 
My friends say I'm w'wather slow— 
S'saying what I 
mean, you know, 
But Ill endeavour 'fore I 
go 
To make it c'clear to you ; 
A 
little attention I 
must demand, 
Then I 
am sure I'll safely land; 
My meaning n'now you understand— 
At least I 
t'trust you do. 
CHORUS. 
may not, perhaps, express myself 
C'clearly unto you; 
Bat then, of c'course you understand— 
At ' least I 
hope you do. 
A 
girl I 
know, call Patti Gray, 
Says I 
never know w'what to say, 
Altho' I 
see her every day. 
My w'words are always so few; 
Near her I 
scarcely can sit or stand, 
But gaze on her and sq'squeeze her band, 
Li'like this—I 
trust you understand— 
Of course I 
se'see you do. 
I 
may not, dm 
I 
squoze her band the other day, 
Said she was like a 
f 
flow& in May, 
And asked if she would name the day, 
To make o'one of us ftwo. 
She answered haughty and so grand,— 
" 
What claim have you, sir, to my hand?" 
Then Hooked like this—you understand,— 
No doubt all of you d'clo. 
I 
may not, (tc. 
4r4 
I 
said, " I 
don't claim anything, 
I 
merely wish the b 
ll 
to ring ;" 
I 
thought I'd said a 
funny thing. 
Tho' she didn't laugh -- that's ftrue; 
But answered in tones so s'sweet and bland, 
"My heart's engaged, and so's my band, 
And so you can go—you understand ?" 
I 
said, " 1 
th'think I 
do." 
I 
may not, dm 
I'm seeking for a 
wife to-night; 
Tho' not good looking, l'm no ; 
You'll find me honest and upright, 
L'loving, klind, and t'true ; 
She mustn't expect to cl'do the grand, 
For I've no carriages or Ian t 
I; 
I've only myself—you understand ?— 
of course I 
se'see you do. 
A(poken. — I've only got a co'comfortable income enough for 
two. 
So if any lady here is inclined to try in'matrimony, now's 
the time; if she don't like me after we're married, she can ego 
home again.—I 
can't say fairer.—She can have her choice as to 
where she'll live, either Shoreditch or Trafalgar Sq'sgare, or some 
other watering-place; I'm not sslfish. ,•:• iie mustn't say If I 
come home late,—*. You might have come home sooner."—I 
hate 
that.— And if I 
want a 
b'button sewn on a 
shirt, soe mustn't say 
she's out of b'buttons. 
I 
hate people to say they're out of b'but-
tons. 
She mustn't grumble if I 
let a 
friend stay to supper now and 
then, and say there's n'not enough for three.—I 
hate when there's 
not enough for three.— In fact, by what i've said, I 
hope you 
know the sort of w'wife I 
want. 
I 
may not, ttc. 
HAPPY THOUGHT. 
Sitting in my room one morning, 
And reflecting on the past, 
I 
thought ' twas time I 
was reforming, 
For I 
knew I 
was too fast; 
Then and there my error seeing, 
Stop. said I, I 
really ought, 
From that time I 
gave up spreeing, 
Wasn't it a 
happy thought. 
Happy thought, happy thought, 
Why did I 
never think of it before now; 
By experience we are taught, 
Yes, 'tis a 
happy, happy thought. 
Searching for a 
lark at night, too, 
Every obstacle I'd scorn, 
Gradually get very tight, too 
Then I'd be locked up till morn ; 
And that very self-same day to, 
'Fore the magistrate 
brought, 
Who says, " Ten days, sir, and a 
fine too;" 
Fine! said ! happy thought. 
I 
visits often used to pay, to 
A damsel who was straight and tall, 
Never shall forget one day, too, 
When I'd climbed the garden wall, 
With kisses her was going to smother, 
When by her master I 
was caught ; 
" 
Please," said she, " sir, it's my brother," 
'Gad, said I, a 
happy thought. 
People used to call me fast, tho' 
Life I 
now consider slow; 
Larks and sprees for me are past, oh, 
I 
am done with them you know. 
A 
friend with whom I'd often tarried, 
Sometime since my lodgings sought; 
" 
said he, "you should get married ;" 
'Jove, said 1, a 
happy thought, 
Happy thought, happy thought, &c. 
My friend's advice I 
took and married, 
And have got a 
family, 
I 
regret I 
so long tarried, 
For I 
could not happier be. 
P'raps I'm keeping you too long, aye 
Longer than I 
really ought; 
But if I've pleased you with my song, why 
Then I'll say, ' twas a 
happy thought. 
Happy thought, happy thought, ac.

Ladies and gentleman, how do you do? 
I'm Polly Patterson. 
I 
just want to make myself known unto you, 
I 
do, I 
do, 
And for a 
husband upon the look out, 
Is Polly Pattersen, 
And that she will find one there is not a 
doubt. 
Oh, no, Oh, no, 
I 
wish that I 
were wed, I 
wish that I 
were wed. 
For that I 
shall die an old maid, I 
have an awful dread. 
CII0R1JS. 
Then gents, don't silent stand, 
But proffer me a 
hand, 
For the offer of a 
husband 
I 
could not just now vt ithstand. 
What do you think of the fine crinoline, 
Of Polly Patterson ? 
And as to my age. I 
am only eighteen, 
It's true It's true, 
By the world understood to be passable fair, 
Is Polly Patterson, 
So I 
don't mean to give myself up to despair, 
Oh, no, Oh, no, 
But I 
shall try to find a 
husband to my mind, 
One to my charms not blind, who'll loving prove and kind. 
Then gents, &c. 
A 
bonnet is worn of the new spoon-bill shape, 
By Polly Patterson, 
Besides a 
short cloak, with a 
neat little cape, 
You knew, you know, 
A 
flounce round my dress at the bottom I 
show. 
Gay Polly Patterson, 
And I 
smile as I 
gaze at a 
good looking beau, 
Just so, just so. 
I 
think myself divine, when I 
am dress'd out fine, 
And look out for to find a 
youth just to my mind. 
Then gents, &c. 
In the season a 
very nice place is Cremorne, 
For Polly Patterson, 
For when I 
am there I 
am never forlorn, 
Oh, no, oh, no, 
I 
flirt with the youths who engage me to dance, 
Sly Polly Patterson, 
For, of a 
proposal, I 
might have a 
chance, 
You know, you know, 
I 
glide through the quadrille, in polka show my skill, 
Or, in the mazy waltz, on hearts I 
make assaults. 
Then gents, &c. 
Play the pianoforte; and sing like a 
bird, 
Can Polly Patterson, 
So you'd better propose, be no longer absurd, 
Now do, now do. 
If that youth with the love locks who's smiling so free 
At Polly Patterson, 
Will the question but pop, to his suit I'll agree, 
Heigho! heigho! 
Then before I 
go away, permit me just to say, 
Your gallantry display and your addresses pay. 
So gents, dm.

FIRST SHE WOULD, AND THEN SHE WOULDN'T 
"OR; OH, YOU NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY MAN." 
Written and Composed by G. W. H UNT. 
To an evaling party once I 
went, 
And I 
met such a 
nice young girl; 
Dress'd 0 ! so tine and smot heed in scent, 
My head soon felt in a 
whirl. 
I 
asked her " if she'd dance with me," 
She gave a 
langaishing• smile; 
She wouldn't say " No," she didn't say " Yes," 
She'd quite a 
peculiar style. 
CHORUS. 
First she wou!d, and then she wouldn't. 
Thee she smil'd and said " site couldn't ;" 
Then she said '• Oh ' my, you shouldn't 
0 
you naughty, naughty mau!" 
I 
sat down by the fair one's side, 
And handed her wine and cake; 
I 
told her what I'd do and dare, 
For such a 
darling's sake. 
She hung her head and smiled and giggled, 
Her giggle to me was bliss; 
And when we parted on that night 
I 
tried to steal a 
kiss. 
First she would, &e. 
I 
often met her after that, 
And I'd take her here and there; 
-tied 'Wry time I 
got it chance, 
My passion I'd declare. 
I've vow'd to he true on t'e ton of Saint Paul's 
On the Underground rail. Richmond Hill ; 
At layt I 
said " if she wouldn't wed 
By jingo myself I'd kill." 
First she svottld, & 
I 
thought it was " right," and AO I 
had 
The banns put lip'• on spec ;" 
And sent my love a " sweet silk dress," 
Her darling self to deck. 
Upon the weddiu'r morn I 
called, 
My intended in•ide to find ; 
Not dressed at all. and worst of all, 
She had not made up her mind. 
Spoken. — She said she thought— 
CHORUS.— A t 
first she would and then she wouldn't, 
And, then somehow she theught, she couldn't 
And then she said " I 
really shouldn't," 
And I 
was a 
naughty, naughty man. 
Well after that we married were, 
And we're pretty jolly at home ,  
To one thing though my wife objects, 
That's Whell I 
wish to roam. 
She says that " home's the proper place 
For all good in
