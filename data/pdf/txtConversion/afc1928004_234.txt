HOW COULD I REFUSE? 
Written for and sung by Miss KITTY BROOKE. 
ONE evening I 
met at a 
party gay, 
A beau so charming fair, 
Such a 
flowing mustache he did display, 
And raven locks of hair; 
So noble, fine, he danced divine, 
His partner me did choose, 
With such a 
glance asked me to dance, 
Now how could I 
refuse 7 
onoaus. 
Of love at first sight I 
have heard, 
And often too we see, 
Although it might seem quite absurd, 
It was the case with me; 
For I 
felt love's power in my heart, 
It was no idle ruse, 
For such a 
winning beau to have, 
Now how could I 
refuse? 
In a 
garden a 
quiet stroll we took, 
He begged an interview, 
Oh, I'll ne'er forget his pleading look, 
So modest, graceful too 
Forget! by Jove! my early love, 
Said be, it is no use 
So bear me pray; what cotild I 
say, 
Now how could I 
refuse 7 
Of love at first sight, etc. 
Now there's no disguise, I'm your cousin, yes, 
That loved you years ago; 
Here I 
am returned for what, can you guess 7 
Your hand—do not say no. 
My band he pressed as I 
confessed 
My feelings won't abuse; 
We'll never part, you've won my heart, 
For how could I 
refuse. 
Of love at first sight, etc.

Every night when he's in port, 
He's washed and dressed and so, 
lie comes on shore, shoves up 'long side, 
And takes me off in tow; 
And as we stroll along the docks, 
Upon my word I 
feel 
As if I'd like to name the day, 
And wed right off the reel.

said it was nice, La! no 
one knows how 'sham'd I was. 
First we danced, and then we sang, our voices thro' the whole house rang, 
And all enjoyed themselves, but I 
really felt so dreadful shy; 
soon I 
found out I 
was in love, for cousin Fred call'd me a 
dove, 
lie press'd my hand, and then said this, I 
intend to have another kiss. 
Chorus.—He kiss'd Inc once, &c. 
When he'd kiss'd me the second time, I 
heard Big Ben commence to chime, 
The clock struck twelve, and then you know I 
thought it was quite time 
to go ; 
So wished good night to every one, who hoped I 
had enjoy'd the fun, 
So Freddy thought 'twouldn't be amiss just to steal another kiss. 
Chorus.—He kiss'd me once, &c. 
He saw me home, it's really true, and we chatted on as lovers do, 
I 
don't remember all he said, I 
know he ask'd if I 
would wed; 
I 
felt I 
blushed, turned very red, and said, I'll marry you, dear Fred; 
Said he, I 
feel so happy, miss, that we'll seal the bargain with a 
kiss. 
Chorus.—Then he kiss'd me once, & c. 
GENTLEMEN'S VERSION. 
When I 
a-courting first began, I 
really was a 
shy young man, 
For I 
feel in love with pretty Fan, forget that day I 
never can; 
For as we were making hay, she sigh'd and said, 0 
lack-a-day; 
Then I 
blush'd as red as apple pipe while gazing on her ruby lips. 
Chorus.-1 
kiss'd her once, how ashamed I 
was; 
I 
kiss'd her twice, how ashamed I 
was; 
I 
kiss'd her thrice I thought it was 
nice,  
But goodness knows how ashamed I 
was. 
And when I 
saw her pretty feet, and rosy lips like cherries sweet, 
I 
felt as tho' I'd lost my heart, and vow'd from her I'd never part; 
She blush'd, and then hung down her head, and in a 
whisper I 
to her said, 
Tell me, darling, what's amiss, then her pouting lips besought a 
kiss. 
Chorus.—I 
kiss'd her once, &c. 
And when I 
asked her if she'd wed, but goodness knows now, what she 
said, 
My head spun round just like a 
top, and I 
really thought she would drop; 
Her heart was beating like a 
clock, which gave my feelings quite a 
shock, 
At length she stammeed—Yes—and then I 
gave her such a 
kiss. 
Chorus.—I 
kiss'd her once, & c. 
Now I'm a 
happy married man, contented with my little Fan, 
And never shall forget the day, we lost our hearts while making hay; 
I 
dance, I 
whistle and I 
sing, for I'm more happy then a 
king, 
And for the little ones, some people say, Fan and I 
are making hay. 
Chorus.—I 
kiss'd her once, &c.

The first time I 
met Charlie, 
'Twas down at Aldershot, 
Tla4ro wn.s to be a 
grand Review, 
So a 
holiday I 
had got; 
And how the ladies stared at him, 
For he looked so very grand, 
As be stepped right and left 
To Godfrey's charming band. 
Cho.—Oh, Charlie, &c. 
He took me down to Brighton, 
As a 
furlough he had got, 
We really should enjoyed ourselves, 
But the sun was burning hot. 
And Charlie thought he'd like a 
bath, 
While I 
the town went round— 
They had to drag poor Charlie out, 
For he very near got drowned. 
Spoken.—Yes, the foolish fellow, to go in the water as he did 
when he knew he couldn't swim, though be told me that he could 
swim like a 
chunk of wood; but it was nearly all up with him 
Oh, if be had been drowned, it would have broken my heart, for 
I'm so fond of--
Cho.-011, Charlie, &c. 
He's going to have a 
fortune 
From his rich old uncle Downs; 
But he wished me to oblige him, 
With the loan of a 
few pounds. 
And then he says he'll marry me, 
For he's making preparations, 
And the wedding's going to take place 
At one of his rich relations.

way, I make him as welcome as 
the flowers in May. 
The jolly old mill, it stands there still, 
As it did in my father's time, 
Who often used to sing to me 
This little bit of rhyme: 
Remember, my boy, don't turn up your nose 
At poorer people in plainer clothes; 
But think, for the sake of your mind's repose 
That wealth is a 
bubble that comes and goes. 
Co.—For I 
laugh, ,Sre. 
I 
never saw the pleasure yet 
Of dressing very loud; 
I 
think there's little good to get 
By looking very proud— 
Or crossing over, when you meet 
A poor acquaintance in the street; 
I 
may be wrong, but then, you know, 
That's merely the style of the miller—just so, 
Cno.—For I 
laugh, dzc. 
I 
think it just as well to try 
To pay your tailor's bill, 
To pay a 
wrong or injury 
With good, instead of ill. 
In fact, I 
think it best to do 
As you'd see others do to you; 
I 
may be wrong, but then, you know, 
That's merely the style of the miller—just 
Cso.—For I 
laugh, dm.

My hat, a

It's the pink of the fashion, and well becomes me ;

The girls of the period dance with delight 
Whenever the Brilliant appears to their sight; 
Cartes and bouquets I'm receiving each day 
From ladies of fashion, in splendid array. 
Such ringing of bells and neighing of horses, 
In gallant equipage right onward my course is; 
Through squares in the west at my leisure I drive, 
And return here at night just to keep you alive.

Then shout for the Brilliant, you men of champagne, 
And pledge his good health to the very last drain; 
And I'll crack a

The health and the fortune of those here to-night. 
Get ready—present—and fill to the brim; 
Fire away—fill again—ne'er mind the tin; 
Drown sorrow and grief, and drive away pain, 
And I'll toast you all o'er again and again.

I'M A YOUNG GIRL OF THE DAY. 
Written by Thomes KENNICK and sung by Miss Kim- BROOKE. 
Tug newspapers are too severe in what they have to say 
About the fast young gentlemen and ladies of the day; 
Their sneers are tinged with malice, so I 
only at them smile, 
And persevere in dressing in a 
fashionable style. 
SPOKEN.—It's quite annoying to think a 
young lady cannot 
dress in a 
costume she thinks charming, without being sneered 
at by newspapers critics. 
What do they know about a 
lady's 
costume ? (turns round to show dress) How do you like mine ? 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
young girl of the day, 
And though they call me gay, 
It's all in my eye about the cry 
That we're so fast and gay 
Old ladies cry " good gracious me, the girls now- a- days 
Have really such extravagant and sad immodest ways; 
When we were girls we never dressed in such a 
silly way !" 
But bless their hearts, they were as bad as girls of our day, 
SPOKEN.—And those old ladies would give as much for a 
yard 
of Honiton lace as would purchase an entire dress for a 
girl of 
the period. 
I've heard my mother and grandmother tillk about 
their point lace, though I 
could never see the point of their dis-
course unless it was to prove they were more extravagant than 
tiny girl of the period. 
I'm not extravagant, and 
I'm a 
young girl of the day, etc. 
Not long ago the cry came out against our crinolines, 
And to balloons compared us, or to images in screens, 
And then they said we wore our hats upon our noses fair, 
While some declare we don't at all wear our own rightful hair. 
SPOKEN.—My 
advice to young ladies is this: dress to please 
yourself; if you try to please everybody you'll please nobody. 
Do as I 
do, wear what you like, but whenever you can get it 
you may copy my style if you chose, and you know— 
I'm a 
young girl of the day, etc. 
Now fashion keeps the world alive and gives a 
spurt to trade, 
And therefore must do good in spite of all that has been said ; 
I 
I) seeking after novelty the girls of our day, 
Are only like the girls of old who've long since passed away. 
SPOKEN.— If the satirical writers don't like the change let 
them go and live where there are no ladies. 
How long would 
they like that, girls, eh ? who cares for the comical papers. 
If 
the girls were all of my mind they would raise their standard, 
seize the tomahawk and punch cilvility into the Telegraph; 
there would be sonic fun in doing that. 
That would be my 
style, and 
I'm a 
yolint girl of the day, etc. 
— 
DO IF YOU DARE 
Sung by Miss Kr= BROOKE. 
Written by CHARLES MERION. 
I'M one of those who don't object 
At all to hearty fun, 
And never, never mind a 
romp 
Or joke with any one; 
I 
do not often take offence 
At trifles light as air; 
But if young men are forward, why 
I 
say—Do if you dare! 
CHORUS. 
Do if you dare, sir! do if you dare ! 
Mind or you'll find that you'd better take care! 
Do if you dare, sir! do if you dare! 
I'm but a 
female, but do if you dare! 
The way that gentlemen behave 
To us is really wrong; 
They try to quiz our ankles 
As we gayly trip along, 
And then they'll cry, " I'll have your eye," 
Or, " I'll have your back hair." 
My answer to such impudence 
Is but—Do if you dare! 
Do if you dare, sir! 
I've heard of rich old bachelors, 
Who wished a 
wife to get, 
But though I'm single I 
have never 
Met with one as yet; 
If such a 
one should say to-night, 
"My gold and jewels share, 
I'll marry you my dear," why, I 
Should say, Do if you dare! 
Do if you dare, sir! etc. 
But I 
shall tire you if I 
stay, 
So think it only right, 
That for your kindness I 
should wish 
You one and all good night; 
I'm not ambitious, and for work 
I 
never much did care, 
So do not pray cry out encore; 
Now then do if you dare! 
Do if you dare, sir! etc.

And I 
was the rightful heir,

Which, by-the-by, is paste ;

Put in a

And if she would only purchase me,

If she'd refuse to be my wife, 
Then gobbled up she'd be.— Cho.

wish that I 
was the Shah, 
With his twenty thousand wives, 
Oh wouldn't I

To marry the Russian Maria, 
I'd sail about the sea in ships, 
And set the Thames on fire.—Cho.

IS 
THE FUN OF THE FAIR. 
Written by G. FRENCH. 
Sung by Miss K ITTY B
:00KE. 
No doubt you all remember 
Greenwich fair when in it's prime, 
For young and old you would behold 
Flock there at Easter time, 
And how the lads and lasses would 
Jump, twist, turn and stare, 
When they got a 
scratch all down the back, 
With all the fun at the fair. 
CHORUS. 
Who'll buy the fun of the fair, 
And make the folks laugh and stare'? 
The best of any only a 
penny, 
All the fun of the fair. 
You saw the dancing booths and fancy stalls, 
And lottery boxes scores, 
Play acting shows and circuses. 
And various drinking stores, 
Gay round-abouts and swinginglSoats, 
And old Aunt Sally's there, 
But nothing pleases the girls so much 
As all the fun at the fair. 
How often would folks fancy 
When the scratcher hard did press 
Against them, that their clothes were torn, 
Or some part of their dress, 
And then they'd shout and run about 
Here, there, and everywhere, 
How they would laugh to avoid the chaff 
At all the fun at the fair. 
Who'll buy, etc 
There married as well as single 
Would all enjoy the fun, 
And how they'd prattle and with rattle 
Behind each other run, 
When down the back they wouldn't lack 
To scratch you, I 
declare; 
Then all the crowd would shout aloud, 
Here's all the fun at the fair, 
Now all who would be happy, 
And fun would ever know, 
They've only but to purchase 
One of them before I 
go, 
Especially those who'd marry, 
You're sure to make a 
match, 
If you'll buy and only try 
To bring them to the scratch. 
Who'll buy, etc. 
• 
Who'll buy, etc. 
Who'll buy, etc. 
THE MARBLE ARCH. 
As I 
strayed beneath a 
marble arch, one evening in July, 
A 
maiden fair, with golden hair, came gently tripping by; 
he lustre of her diamond eye, shone on me like a 
torch, 
And in a 
whisper soft she said, is this the marble arch 7 
CHORUS. 
Then round her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
pressed her, I 
caressed her, my brain was in a 
whirl ; 
Around her lovely form I 
drew my magic circle, 
I 
kissed her and I 
called her a 
very pretty girl. 
I 
took her to a 
shady spot beneath the spreading trees, 
I 
took hold of her lily-white hand, and fell down on my knees, 
Beloved, cried I, arise, said she, and before I 
had time to speak 
She imprinted one burning kiss upon my blooming cheek. 
Then round her lovely form, etc. 
Good-night, says she, in a 
voice so sweet, and gently squeezed 
my hand, 
My knees began to knock and shake, for I 
could scarcely 
stand ; 
We'll meet again some other night, and then prepare to march, 
But where, cried I, she then replied, beneath that marble arch. 
Then round her lovely form, etc. 
However, since that fatal night, I 
have not seen my queen, 
But I've heard them say she's run away with a 
big fat horse 
marine ; 
A 
ring I'll give her when we meet, but not as you suppose, 
I'll never put it on her hand, I'll stick it through her nose. 
Then round her lovely, etc.

'MOULD LIKE TO BE A PAIRY.—[Coseumsul 
If I 
had fairy wings, you know, 
I'd tease out of their lives 
Old bachelors, and flirting men, 
Who won't make girls their wives; 
I'd hover round their haunts, and show 
The joy a 
wedding brings, 
And try to touch their stony hearts 
With Cupid's fairy wings. 
CHORUS.—I should like to be a 
fairy, 
So graceful, light, and airy; 
How nice to be a 
fairy with 
A 
pair of paper wings. 
I'd try to show the wealthy few, 
The good they might insure, 
With fairy wings of golden hue, 
Amidst our starving poor; 
I'd teach them in sumptuous hotness 
That poverty oft brings 
The poor to lose it's honesty 
Through want of golden wings. 
CHORUS.

So graceful, light, and airy; 
How nice to be a

We've all our different fancies, let 
Them be whate'er they may, 
If we wish to do the heavy, why 
Then for it we must pay; 
So, when upon the " fly," my boys, 
Your sprees and little flings, 
Just bear in mind that bank notes make 
The best of paper wings.

I SHOULD LIKE TO. 
As sung with great applause by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
ALL kinds of fun and frolic too, I 
meet with night and day, 
And yet from all of it I 
have to tear myself away; 
The girls again I 
always meet., are something sweet I 
vow, 
Oh, couldn't I 
enjoy myself if I 
were single now. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, now I'm married and settlel, I 
come across no 
end of chances for real enjoyment. 
When I 
was single things 
were as dull as ditch water. 
It's cruel to be tantalized in this 
manner now a 
fellow's running in double harness, and when I 
see my old single members going out for a 
regular break down, 
that's the time when I 
feel as though— 
CHORUS. 
I 
should like to, I 
should like to, and sorry I 
am to say shan't, 
But the fact is, yes, the fact is, I'm married alas, and I 
can't. 
Some friends of mine they called on me, ' tis just a 
week ago, 
And with them on a 
trip at once, they said that I 
must go ; 
Of course they all seemed greatly vexed, and savage quite to find 
That I 
could not their frolic share, but had to stay behind. 
SPOKEN.—They said, " This won't do, old fellow, you must 
come, for we're going to have a 
genuine flare-up and no mis-
take." " I'm very sorry, my dear boys," was my gloomy re-
ply, " but it really can't be managed—she's in the next room— 
but of course I 
should wish you thoroughly to understand, 
that "— 
I 
should like to, etc. 
One night last week I 
overtook a 
lady tall and fair, 
Oh ! hazel were her beaming eyes, and golden was her hair, 
This fair one I 
a 
little while in doubt and silence eyed, 
But soon we both together got, and walked on side by side. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, this dear little creature and I 
soon got on 
very good terms, and at last she said—" Won't you take rue to 
the theatre ?" " Eh? Ah," said I—" Pm grieved to observe 
that you're asking an impossibility, I am utterly powerless to 
manage it, though I 
really can assure you that "— 
I 
should like to, etc. 
But now I 
must conclude my song and toddle off with speed, 
Or otherwise I 
feel convinced there'll be a 
row indeed, 
For Mary Jane, my vixen wife, is waiting close at hand, 
And rows with her, I 
do declare, are more than I 
can stand. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, ladies, I 
must now bid you adieu; I 
trust you 
will not ask me to sing again, as my wife is so awfully jealous, 
although, as far as I'm personally concerned, you know— 
CHORUS. 
I 
should like to, I 
should like to, and sorry I 
am to say shan't 
But the fact, oh, the fact is, I 
hear my wife coming and can't.

Sung by Miss K ITTIE B ROOKE. 
I ONCE had a 
model lover, 
Quite a 
dandy I 
declare, 
Who had a 
very high opinion of himself, 
But I 
quickly did discover 
That this very model lover 
Had in his heail a 
tenement to let; 
He tried to do the grand, while soliciting my hand, 
And said he'd lots of pretty girls in view. 
CHORUS. 
And one was Isabella, with her gingham umbrella, 
And her father kept a 
barber shop at Weehawken. 
He came one day in a 
hurry, 
And declared he could not stay, 
He was going to the bankers for some cash, 
He'd buy a 
handsome carriage, 
And if I'd consent to marriage, 
We would beat our neighbors all to smash; 
But if I'd say nay he'd not wait another day, 
For another girl was dying for the chance. 
CHORUS. 
And she was as beautiful as a 
butterfly, 
And as proud and so fair, 
Was his pretty little Polly Perkins, 
Of Madison Square. 
He came one day soon after, 
I 
could scarce restrain from laughter, 
When he says, " Love, do name the happy day— 
Do, love, pray some pity show 
But I 
firmly answered No, 
Then he turned with such a 
look of deep despair. 
.CILORUS. 
Oh my, look upon me now, 
Of your victim take a 
slight observation; 
To get rid of all my woes 
I'll hang myself and drown my clothes; 
Then he left me in a 
state of desolation.

" 
MY PAPA SAYS I MAY." 
Written and Composed by ROLLIN HOWARD. Sung by M ISS KITTIE 
BROOKE. 
HE'D an eye as bright as stars of night, 
A 
smile that pierc'd my soul, 
A 
mustache, oh my! that made me quite 
A 
slave to love's control; 
At all the balls and festive halls 
I've reigned with queenly sway; 
Though mother says I 
mustn't, 
My papa says I 
may. 
CHORUS. 
I 
have to live ' twixt doubts and fears 
Ma's cross the live long day; 
Though mother says I 
mustn't 
My papa says I 
may. 
So some fine night just out of spite, 
To end my Harry's bother, 
I'll mitten some ten of my love-sick men, 
And give my hand to my loser. 
Now papa says he admires my choice, 
And I'm his pet they say; 
Though mother says I 
mustn't, 
My papa says I 
may. 
I 
have to live,. etc. 
A wedding sure will be the end, 
With all the fashion's capers, 
But I'll not tell, ' twill be told so well, 
In all the daily papers 
I'll love him, oh dear, wont, I ? well, 
That's right I 
hear dear pa say ; 
Though mother says I 
mustn't, 
My papa says I 
may, 
I 
have to live, etc. 
JENNIE THAT PLAYS THE HARP. 
As sung by Miss Kir= BnooKE. 
MY 
name's Jennie Morgan, a 
lassie you see, 
I 
came from North Wales, where I'm happy and free; 
There's Ivings and Harkins, and a 
half dozen more, 
Each love me so dearly and on me set store. 
CEO HILTS. 
But my name it is Jennie, 
They say I'm so sharp, 
I 
came from North Wales, 
And I 
play the Welsh harp. 
The lad that I 
love more than diamonds or gold 
Is my darling Harry, so gallant and bold; 
He's not far from here, but where I 
shan't say, 
We are soon to be married, for he's named the day. 
But my name it is, etc. 
When I 
was a 
child a 
fire came one night, 
In trying to save me my lad lost his sight; 
He rushed through the fire in danger and strife, 
And now to reward him, why, I'll ha his wife. 
But my name it is, etc.

TURN A LITTLE HANDLE. 
Polly Poplin she worked at a 
Sewing Machine, 
And lived in a 
garret at Bethnal Green; 
At a 
furious rate she would run up each seam. 
For you must know this machine went by steam, 
Spoken—And all she had to do was to— 
CHORUS. 
Turn a 
little handle, feed the needle well. 
Lay the work upon a 
plate, then you can take a 
spell; 
To run a 
seam upon a 
machine that goes by steam, just keep 
it clean, 
And don't go bursting of the boiler. 
One morning when Polly was taking a 
snack, 
Her crinoline rather stuck out at the back, 
The machine started off and before you'd say whack, 
Sewed her up in her crinoline just like a 
sack. 
Turn a 
little handle, &c. 
To stay the machine of course she couldn't, 
To bite of the thread you know she shouldn't, 
To scream she was lazy and wouldn't, 
It sewed up her mouth and then she couldn't. 
Turn a 
little handle, &c„ 
Her landlady's name was Mrs. M'Click, 
At a 
difficult job she never would stick, 
So plying herself with brandy quick, 
It took her twelve months this girl to unpick. 
Turn a 
little handle, &c. 
Now the house it is haunted but causes no fright, 
They've only to put the stuff in over night; 
And it's made into shirts before the daylight, 
So they're making their fortunes, believe me, °Wright. 
Turn a 
little handle, & c.

THE BONNIE SOLDIER LA.DDIE. 
Written by Mr. GEORGE W ARE. 
Sung by Miss limy BROOM. 
MY 
love he is a 
soldier in lands far away, 
A 
light-hearted laddie, so cheerful and gay, 
And when he returns he's going to be wed, 
So I 
love my soldier laddie with his jacket so red; 
lie has fine rosy cheeks, he's a 
brave, handsome lad 
The pride of his mother, the joy of his dad, 
For his ways are so winning, and I'll wait awhile 
For my soldier laddie of the rank and file. 
CHORUS. 
Then with colors flying and banners so gay, 
Along with my laddie I 
will march away, 
For his ways are so winning, and I'll wait awhile 
For my soldier laddie of the rank and file. 
'Tis a 
year since he left and bid me adieu; 
He will not deceive me—he loves me too true, 
And I 
love the laddie, and I'm longing to see 
My soldier returning—then he'll marry me; 
But a 
day seems a 
month, and a 
month seems a 
year, 
When longing for your true lover's voice to hear, 
But his ways are so winning, and he'll soon be back, 
And have lots of treasures for me in his knapsack. 
Then with, etc. 
Ile sent me a 
letter, each word breathing love, 
Comparing my eyes to the bright stars above; 
He speaks of promotion, but. he'll wait awhile 
Ere he's made a 
general from the rank and file; 
But, whether a 
private or a 
K. C. B., 
I 
don't care a 
fig if he still loves me, 
For his ways are so winning, and he'll soon be home, 
Then all o'er the world with my laddie I'll roam.

, 
I 
joined the ranks so martial, 
As you can plainly see, 
Though to " Reviews" I'm partial, 
No " rifle-butt" I'll be. 
At " small sword exercise" I'm great 
Although perhaps you ' 11 smile, 
I 
do the " goose-step" like a " duck; 
In military style. 
Chorus.—How do you like, &c. 
To " sham fights" I'm devoted, 
And always " gain the day;" 
I'm sure to be promoted 
For " merit" not for " pay." 
I've read the deeds of" Wellington," 
But in a

I 
fancy I 
shall " cut him out" 
In military style. 
Chorus.—How do you like, &e. 
And when there's warfare raging, 
There often is, no doubt, 
With manners so engaging, 
I'll put the foe to rout;

girl for use—not dress'd up for show. 
I 
can sing, &o. 
Under the snow the grass is green, 
Though hidden from our eyes awhile, 
The tiny plants are sleeping too, 
Till spring awakes them with her smile; 
They snugly lie till sunshines glow, 
Under the snow, under the snow. 
Our dearest thoughts, our brightest hopes, 
Lie bidden thus thro' winter's frost, 
Though deeply buried in the snow, 
They are not altogether lost; 
They'll come again with spring, although 
Like tlow'rs they sleep, under the snow. 
The' winter seems se bleak and long, 
Tho' snow be falling thick and fast, 
From out the clouds so dark and drear, 
The golden sun will break at last; 
When birds will sing, and tlow'rs will blow 
Tho' they all lie under the snow. 
THE LADIES' DARLING. 
Sung by Miss KITTY BROOKE. 
OF 
all young beaux who the girls most esteem, 
Sure riflemen now in their hearts reign supreme, 
But throughout the band whether youthful or old, 
There's no one like Charley, so gallant and bold, 
For when he's in uniform ( gaiters and all), 
With his rifle and cap, with a 
little round ball, 
To see him march by, the girls they all cry, " Oh, 
Is he not charming, so handsome and tall 'P' 
CHORUS. 
For Charley's a 
gallant and gay volunteer; 
As the pride of his comrades he's fam'd far and near, 
And so handsome and brave, oh, he is such a 
dear, 
They call him the ladies' darling. 
As straight as a 
ramrod he marches about, 
With his elbows turn'd in and his toes pointing out, 
While his waist-belt around him so tightly doth twine, 
He looks like a 
wash in a 
rapid decline; 
His hair up the middle so straightly cloth part, 
And his loves of long whiskaws comb out, oh, so smart, 
That when he draws nigh with glass in his eye, 
No foeman to hurt him could e'er have the heart. 
For Charley, etc. 
He's bold as a 
lion, and makes no pretence 
When he says how he'll fight for his country's defence, 
For he curls his mustache with an aspect so grim, 
I 
tremble to think what may happen to him; 
He says should an army once venture to land, 
If none of his comrades beside him will stand, 
he'll go out alone, our wrongs to atone, 
And woe to the foeman who comes 'neath his hand, 
For Charley, etc. 
To be a 
crack shot be esteems the first thing, 
And he declares he can bring down a 
fly ( on the wing) ; 
So he goes every night on the roof- tiles and flats 
To keep up his practice by shooting the cats; 
Should therefore invasion its terrors impend, 
With confidence all may rely on the end, 
Nor tremble, nor chafe, but deem ourselves safe, 
With sweetheart like Charley our homes to defend. 
For Charley, etc.

APPLES FOUR A PENNY. 
America is my nation, 
Humble is my station, 
A. grocer by situation, 
0 how shall I 
explain; 
Well I 
loved a 
girl called Kitty, 
Who sells apples in the city, 
On me shell not take pity, 
Her love I 
tried to gain; 
I've asked her in marriage 
I've a 
donkey and a 
carriage, 
And I'd take her out to Harlem, 
If she'd but name the day. 
CHORUS. 
But now she goes each morning, 
And thro' the streets she's hauling 
A 
hand-truck, and loudly calling, 
In a 
voice sl loud and high, 
Apples ripe and rosy, 
Here's your fine strawberry, 
Damson plums, aud cherries, 
You can taste before you buy. 
I 
oft at market meet her, 
And with smiles I 
greet her, 
And then I 
wish to treat her— 
As one that I 
love dear; 
And if I 
do tell her 
Of some bargains I 
could sell her, 
A nasty low lifed fellow. 
Says what do you want here. 
And if to her 
speaking, 
Peih. -ps with fond words greeting; 
This filow's always sneaking, 
And ey'ry word will hear. 
And now she goes, ctc. 
I 
made up my mind one morning, 
Upon this fellow calling, 
To tell him of my falling 
In love with Kitty dear, 
Well I 
did repent it, 
For he raised his fist and sent it 
To my nose and bent it, 
What shall I 
do ? oh dear 
For her I'm always fretting. 
The tears my eyes are wetting, 
So I'll drown my woes in betting, 
For I've always in my car— 
So now she goes, &c. 
RACKETY FAN. 
Sung with immense success by Miss K ITTY BIlOOKE. 
My granny often says that Pm 
Enough to drive her mad, 
And judging by my actions, 
I 
should have been a 
lad; 
She says I 
am a 
torment, 
For rest still I 
never can, 
That's why I 
have 2ot the nickname 
Of Rackety Young Fan 
They call me Rackety Fan, 
I'm full of frolic and glee, 
There's no mistake, I 
am 
The identical girl for a 
spree. 
All sorts of funny tricks I 
play, 
The boys I 
like to tease, 
I 
play at hop-scotch, hide and seek, 
And climb too up the trees; 
I'm very good at donkey rides, 
I 
can fight, can sing and sew, 
I'm sure to get the sweetheart too, 
Wherever I 
may go. 
They call me, etc. 
I 
always play the Charley way, 
Whenever I've a 
chance; 
When in the street an organ plays 
You then should see me dance; 
My sister and my cousin Em, 
I've nearly driven mad, 
Because I 
wink at their young men, 
They say it is too bad. 
They call me, etc. 
Although I 
am a 
tom-boy, 
And for mischief I'm all there, 
Still there are many worse than me, 
If to find them you know where ; 
Don't fancy that I'm bad at heart 
Because rough is my tongue, 
As life is short I 
mean to have 
My fling whilst I 
am young. 
They call me, etc.

ON THE PARADE.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Now some like the jetty's, 
And some like the piers, 
Infested by nurse-maids, 
And infants—" sweet dears"— 
And some climb the heights, 
But as I 
am afraid 
Of too much exertion 
I 
keep the Parade. 
Spoken.—If a 
fella goes up a 
hill, he has to come down again 
some time or other. 
If a 
fella does the Beach, it's all" now for 
rowing," or " now for " 
fresh baked shrimps," and" fresh 
boiled buns," and such like confounded bores so I 
keep— 
On the Parade, oke. 
Now some like the sands, 
Some rude fellas there be, 
Who quiz the fair charmers, 
Who bathe in the sea. 
Some " go in" for sailing, 
But of that I'm afraid; 
I 
feel so much safer 
When on the Parade. 
Spoken.—A 
" 
sail in a 
pleasure-boat," pleature--61), excuse me I 
when a 
fella's on shore he knows where he is, but when a 
fella's 
in a 
pleasure (?) boat, he don't know where he is, and feels as if 
he didn't care where he went to; so I 
feel more " at home."— 
On the Parade, dr,c. 
'Tis upon the Parade, 
When the sun's going down, 
One meets with the fairest 
Elite of the town. 
There's one charmer I'd " pop " to, 
But feel most afraid, 
She's the fairest and richest 
Upon the Parade. 
Spoken.—Beautiful creature 
daughter of an Indian banker— 
nandsome girl—with an ugly old governor—the old buffer has a

LADY DlINDREARY. 
As sung by Miss KITTY BROOKE. 
IF 
friends here to- night will listen to me, 
I'll tell you a 
comical history ; 
No doubt when it's over you all will agree 
It's about me and my Lord Dundreary; 
My Lord, you will own, is doing the grand, 
And how he is doing it you can't understand, 
For he brings in the money which rules the land, 
Does the husband of Lady Dundreary. 
CHORUS. 
For novelty now, you'll own, is all the rage, 
They pay a 
good price this sensation age; 
Mr. Buckstone I'm sure would be glad to engage 
Another hit like my Lord Dundreary. 
With mustache and fine whiskers of very black hair, 
If not very novel, you'll own rather rare, 
On the face of a 
lady it looks somewhat queer, 
But not so bad for my Lady Dundreary 
My husband's not here, or I 
know he'd propose 
That as well as his beard I 
shall wear his clothes ; 
If you look at my face, and not at my toes, 
You'll see the portrait of my Lord Dundreary. 
For novelty, etc. 
It's a 
capital joke you all will admit, 
To see how they're cramm'd into boxes and pit; 
Unless you look sharp you can't get a 
seat, 
To see the husband of Lady Dundreary ; 
My lord counts his fingers, at least I've been told ; 
While my lord's doing that why, I 
count the gold, 
And he struts like a 
peacock, looking quite bold, 
Though husband of Lady Dundreary. 
For novelty, etc. 
With a 
glass in his eye, and a 
peculiar run, 
Or to see a 
man sneeze you think it's good fun, 
But a 
much better joke to see the folks run 
To look at my Lord Dundreary ; 
When he reads you a 
letter which leaves you in doubt, 
When finished you do not know what it's about, 
This and a 
sneeze ends the last novelty out 
Of my Lord and my Lady Dundreary. 
For novelty, etc.

NOTHER, HE'S GOING AWAY. 
Sung in " BARNEY'S COURTSHIP." 
Sure, now what are you crying for Nelly ? 
Don't be blubbering there like a 
fool, 
Wid the weight of the grief, faith, I 
tell ve, 
Yell break down the three-legged stool. 
I 
suppose now you're crying for Barney, 
But den't believe a 
word that he'd say, 
He tells nothing but big lies and blarney, 
Sure you know how he served poor Kate Kearney—" 
CHORUS. 
"But mother"—" Oh bother 1" 
" 
But mother he's going away, 
And I 
dreamed Vother night 
Of his ghost al in white, 
Oh I 
mother, he's going away." 
"If he's going away all the better, 
Blessed hour when he's out of your sight, 
There's one comfort you can't get a 
letter, 
For yez neither can read nor write, 
'Twas only list week you protested, 
When he c 
tutted fat Biddy Macree, 
That the siglIt of the scamp you detested, 
Wid abuse, sure, your tongue never rested—' 
"But mother 
Oh, bother :" 
" 
But mother he's going away ; 
And I 
dreamed that his ghost, 
Walled round my bed-post, 
Oh mother he's going away."

THE MOONLIGHT WALE.. 
By J. H. MiLsusN, 
Last autumn I 
went out of town, 
Just for a 
change of air; 
It's very strange but so it was, 
A charmer I 
met there. 
How pleasantly the ev'ning pass'd, 
While listuing to her talk ; 
For I 
first made her acquaintance, - 
When I 
took a 
moonlight walk. 
CHORUS. 
There's nothing half so jolly as a 
moonlight walk, 
A moonlight walk, a 
moonlight walk ; 
There's nothing half so jolly as a 
moonlight walk, 
A moonlight walk for me. 
Qn'te by myself I 
took a 
stroll, 
To view the lovely scenes; 
To read the stars, as some folks say, 
Tho' I 
scarce know what that means; 
I'd not gone far before I 
heard, 
A footstep on the grass; 
On turning round, just by my side, 
I 
saw this damsel pass. 
There's nothing, &c. 
The next night too, I 
saw her there, 
'Twas strange. now, was it not I 
And tho' I 
scarce can tell you how, 
Acquainted we soon got. 
She said " her Pa was Captain of 
The well known Tomahawk 
And like me, to study nature's scene , 
She took that moonlight walk. 
There's nothing, & c. 
Night after night it seem'd as if 
By fate we both were led; 
So long before I 
came to town, 
I 
asked her if shed wed ? 
She blushing, said, " she felt that she 
My pleasure could not baulk 
So promised t 
hot she'd have me, while 
We took our moonlight walk. 
There's nothing. & c. 
Now shortly I 
shall call her mine, 
And we will go away; 
To sonic secluded spot to pass 
The honeymoon so gay. 
And there together all the day, 
Of by- gone times we'll talk; 
And not forget to speak about 
Our pleasant moonlight walk. 
There's nothing, ezo.

THE MERRIEST GIRL THAT'S OUT. 
With laughter and, good humor, why, 
I 
pass my time away, 
So, while l'm here Pll do my best 
To please you with ray lay. 
Then, come along and join my song, 
And raise a 
merry shout, 
To welcome me: for, Pm you see, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
CHORUS. 
Now then, young men, 
Don't be melancholy: 
Just see, like me, 
If you can't be jolly. 
If any thing goes wrong with ma, 
I 
never sulk or pout: 
In fact, I 
am, and always was, 
The merriest girl that's out. 
The gentlemen complain and. say; 
I'm such a 
dreadful flirt: 
But if they will make love to me, 
Their hearts Pm sure to hurt— 
I 
really can't help laughing, 
When I 
hear them sigh about; 
For sentiment it don't suit me ; 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, gao. 
The notes and presents I 
receive, 
Would fill a 
basket quite, 
While bouquets rare, I 
do declare, 
Are sent me every night. 
The notes all speak of broken hearts 
Some mean it, l've no doubt; 
I'm sorry: yet I 
still remain 
The merriest girl that's out, 
Now, then, to.' 
To balls and. parties T 
oft go: 
For, dancing I 
admire, 
And waltzing is a 
thing, I 
own, 
Of which I 
never tire; 
And should my partner squeeze my hand, 
I 
know what l'm about: 
It pleases him, and don't hurt me • 
I'm the merriest girl that's out. 
Now then, &43;

THE TICKET ON THE SHAWL.- [CoNct.upen.] 
I 
bought the shawl without delay. 
Most girls, you know, like some display; 
That garment I 
so wished to don, 
So in the shop I 
put it on; 
Of course, I 
felt it no surprise 
To notice every body's eyes 
Attracted by my purchase, no, 
I 
felt quite sure it would be so. 
Oh dear, &e. 
My ears were startled, I 
declare, 
When I 
heard a 
lad cry out, " Look there ' 
Why, I 
say, Bill, lor' bless my eyes, 
Don't she know how to advertise?" 
Then Bill replied, " Well, I 
must say, 
The lady does look rather gay, 
She really is a 
charmer, Ben, 
And precious cheap at two pounds ten." Oh dear, cte. 
I 
walked as far as Temple Bar, 
When a 
girl said, " Oh, miss, there you are; 
I 
must confess you do look nice, 
But you shouldn't ticket up the price." 
A 
cabman cried out, " Miss, good luck, 
likes a 
girl \vot's got good pluck, 
I'll buy yotf for a 
wife, miss, when 
I 
saves as much as two pounds ten." 
Oh, dear ke-
I 
felt a 
kind of strange alarm, 
But a 
gent politely touched my arm, 
Saying, " Let me your attention call 
To this ticket pinned upon your shawl." 
I 
nearly fell, but he caught my arm, 
And his soothing words had such a 
charm; 
We married, and I 
bless the hour when 
He met me marked up " two pounds ten." 
And now I 
am a 
happy wife, 
Surrounded by the joys of life, 
I 
often tell of where and when 
He saw me marked up "two pounds ten."

UPON THE GRAND PARADE. 
Written by W ALTER GIWENAWAY.

DE Win, 33 _Rose Street. 
Price five cents.] 
Let some folks talk of foreign life, its pleasures and its joys, 
But continental gaiety to me's all empty noise ! 
And rattling, dashing London, too, is quite thrown in the 
shade, 
By Brighton in the season, there tc walk the Grand Pardde, 
CHORUS. 
Upon the Grand Parade, upon the Grand Parade, 
The Grand Parade at Brighton throws our West End 
in the shade ! 
Upon the Grand Parade, upon the Grand Parade, 
Oh! such a 
jolly set you meet upon the Grand Parade. 
What can be more delightful, than the charming morning 
walk, 
Such lots of dashing fellows, with lots of funny talk ; 
Such pretty little speeches, though I'm dreadfully afraid 
There are some naughty fibs oft told upon the Graud 
Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, .tc. 
Now, girls who want a 
sweetheart, that's the place to pick 
and choose, 
There are Dutchmen, Frenchmen, Germans, Turks, Itali-
ans, Greeks, and Jews, 
And nice old English gentlemen, who have a fortune 
made, 
And gay young sparks, with none at all, upon the Grand 
Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, &c. 
If ever I 
get married, oh ! I 
hope that it will be 
To some nice jolly captain, who's been all his days at se.1 ; 
Then I'll persuade him just to stop, and buy his little 
maid 
A charming villa by the sea, and near the Grand Parade. 
Upon the Grand Parade, &e. 
41 
STROLLING ON THE SANDS. 
Of course we all know Ramsgate well, 
That spot to thonsinds dear, 
*Where dashing belles and heavy swells, 
Assemble ev'ry year: 
Some liko to roam along the Pier. 
And view what that commands, 
But my delight, from morn till night, 
Is strolling on the sands. 
CHORUS. 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
Watching all the bathers dip, list'ning to the band; 
Strolling on the sands, strolling on the sands, 
In cool or heat there's nought to beat a 
stroll upon the sands. 
I'll ne'er forget last summer-time, 
I 
spent a 
fortnight there, 
And made the sweet acquaintance of 
A lovely lady fair, 
She'd gone to bathe at Dumpton Gap, 
But, ob ! the naughty quean, 
For once she thought she'd do without 
That vile bathing machine. 
She placed her clothes upon the beach. 
Then in the water played. 
But when she tried to come on shore, 
Oh ! wasn't she dismayed : 
The tide had turn'd, and all her clothes 
Were floating out to sea, 
She'd nothing but her bathing dress— 
In what a 
plight to be. 
I 
fetch'd her mother to her aid, 
And saved all further strife, 
The maiden said, " this great event 
I'll think of all my life." 
We soon became the best of friends 
For all enjoy'd the fun ; 
We're lovers now—and soon we two 
Are going to be one.

WY JOHNNY LOVE IS A SOLDIER.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
My love holds a 
commission, 
In what, I 
will not tell, 
For fear the ladies fair, with him 
Might fall in love as well, 
He wears a 
sash, a 
sword and cap, 
With a 
strap beneath his nose, 
And looks every inch a 
soldier, in 
His regimental clothes. 
Spoken—Espec:ally when he cries : 
Tlur-r-r Imp! stiff as starch, &e. 
Cnoars.—My Johnny love is a 
soldier, &c. 
My Johnny drills the awkward squad, 
And gives command so fine; 
"Turn out your toes," " hold up your nose lu 
As they stand in a 
line. 
Sometimes he looks ferocious, 
Which makes them look so shy, 
And don't they tremble in their shoes 
When he begins to cry : 
Hur-r-r hup! stiff as starch, dr,c. 
CHORMS. — My Johnny love is a 
soldier, &c. 
My Johnny'll be field-marshal, 
Or an admiral some day; 
I 
hope no war may e'er break out 
To take my love away; 
He's popp'd the question, and says, when. - 
In wedlock's banns are we, 
There shall ne'er be war between us 
And his colonel I 
shall be. 
Spoken—And then, of course, I 
shall do the— 
Iiur-r-r hup! stiff as starch, 
Right about face—quick march!

A

And he's awfully fond of

SOMETHING NEW . 
Sung by Miss KITTY BROOKE,. 
MY 
home it is in Newport, 
Of fashion the abode, 
And if I 
have a 
weakness, 
It is for following the mode; 
I'm fond of novels and burlesque, 
Of fun and flirting too; 
In fact I 
don't mind what it is 
If it's only something new. 
CII013 
A 
chignon or a 
bonnet 
With a 
lovely flower upon it, 
Or a 
pair of gloves to wear, 
When I'm on Sunday at the Zoo ; 
A 
short dress, a 
long dress, 
I 
both should like I 
must confess, 
A 
pair of boots, a 
parasol, 
Or any thing that's new. 
I 
have the latest fashions 
From Paris sent direct, 
My style by all who sees me 
Is considered quite correct 
But keeping up with everything, 
It's as much as I 
can do, 
I've got no end of trouble 
To get me something new. 
A chignon or a 
bonnet, etc. 
Some day I 
mean to marry, 
When I 
can find a 
bean 
Who comes up to my standard; 
I'm particular you, know ; 
He must be handsome, young of course, 
And very fond of me ; 
And let me do just as I 
please, 
I'm sure we should agree. 
SPOKEN.—But he must promise to let me have.

Some fellas go in for the army, 
And some fellas go in for trade, 
But I 
havn't such bores to alarm me, 
My fortune was already made. 
And some fellas go in for brain; 
And scribble to turn in a

Those fellas deserve all their gains, 
As for brains I 
could do without any—Ono.

In the Park I

Whenever I

Somehow I'm a

Sometimes to an evening party, 
To keep them alive in I 
peep, 
Whenever they ask me sing 
They're certain to fall fast asleep. 
SPOKEN—I give them " Yankee Doodle," you know, or else 
give them the " Dead March in Saul" on the flute; oh, it's

For which I 
get no I. 0. U.; 
Sometimes I

Which / have to pay when they're due. 
There are mothers, with daughters to marry, 
Somehow take a

They think they're as deep as Old Harry,

ALL AMONGST THE HAY, 
GIRLS. 
As Sung by M ss K ITTY BROOKS. 
I'm a 
young girl as you see, 
And no cares have I; 
None enjoy a 
lark like me, 
Between earth and sky; 
When the beat of day is o'er, 
I 
then haste away, 
And a 
pleasant evening pass 
All amongst the bay. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, there's no doubt about it, I 
leave home with 
the quickness of a 
velocipede and very soon find myself— 
CUOROUS. 
All amongst the bay, girls, all amongst the bay ; 
Chatting with a 
handsome man to pass the time away; 
AU among the hay, girls, all among the hay. 
Don't you think it's very nice when all amongst the hay 
Youth's the time a 
beau to get, 
While cloth beauty last, 
But if you contented rest, 
Until your beauty's passed, 
Can you grumble at your state, 
If you're on the shelf; 
Who have you got to blame I 
ask 7 
No one but yourself. 
SPOKEN.—I 
don't intend to be an old maid and sit with the cal, 
on my shoulder. 
Not I. 
I 
hope to wed a 
young man with 
cheeks like roses, lips like rubies, eyes like diamonds, and above 
all, plenty of money in his pocket. 
That's the sort of a 
person 
I'm looking for. 
AU amongst the hay, etc.

WHO'LL BUY MY VIOLETS ? 
Sung by Miss KITTY BROOKE. Words and Music by Sam BAGNALL. 
LADIES, dear ladies, and gentlemen, too, 
For one single moment pray listen—ab, do, 
To a 
wandering florist, with my little few 
Of sweet- scented beauties to sell unto you; 
I'm far, far away from my own native France, 
Where the gayest and fairest exquisitely dance, 
With garlands of flowers of various hues— 
Will you from my basket, will you please to choose 7 
CHORUS. 
Of my violets, roses, sweet- scented posies, 
All of them sparkling and dripping with dew ; 
Violets, roses, sweet- scented posies— 
Who'll buy my roses all sprinkling with dew 7 
Deserted, au, me, not one single sou, 
Then, charming ladies, I 
ask of you 
To look at my roses and lilies so fair, 
Like diamonds they sparkle and shine in your hair; 
I 
have violets and roses, and pansies as well, 
The blue bells of Scotland, the Scottish blue bells, 
The shamrock so green; I 
have also sweet rose— 
Will you from my basket, will you please to choose. 
Of my violets, etc. 
Will you buy, if you please, if you please will you buy I 
I've come a 
long way, my fortune to try, 
I've come from my France, my once sunny land— 
They make you look handsome, they make you look 
grand; 
I've some for your coats, I've some for your rooms, 
The odor is delicious and all in full bloom; 
If you will not buy them they will wither and die, 
And leave me to wonder and pitiful cry— 
Of my violets, etc.

MOTTOES AND KISSES.-{e-nNCLUDED.1 
If you love me as I 
love you 
No knife can cut our loves in two, 
And so the best thing you can do 
Is just give a 
little kiss. 
To make poor little Cupid blind 
Was very cruel and unkind, 
He's got his lips, so never mind, 
So long as he can kiss. 
Cno.-A kiss for you, &e. 
" 
Oh take, oh take those lips a 
way," 
I 
hear a 
timid maiden say, 
" 
But bring 'em back another day, 
To give another kiss." 
Faint heart fair lady never won, 
So go on as you have begun, 
And if you won't tell any one, 
I'll let you have a 
kiss. 
Cuo.-A kiss for you, &e. 
" 
Oh, come with me to fairy dells," 
We'll build our home of oyster.shells, 
Where no intruder near us dwells, 
To see us give a 
kiss. 
Love in a 
cottage, oh, how sweet, 
Till poverty comes down the street, 
Then out love flies, his wings are fleet, 
He doesn't stop to kiss. 
Cno.-A kiss for you, ike. 
Some folks who would our love annoy, 
Have put poor Cupid ever coy, 
In nickerbockers, naughty boy, 
Because he learnt to kiss. 
I 
hope my song has caused delight, 
And if you kindly think I'm right, 
I'll come again another night, 
And throw another kiss. 
Ctto.-A kiss for you, die.

I MUST GO OUT ON SUNDAY. 
Sung by Miss KITTY B11008E. 
I'm Jenny Jinks the kitchen maid, 
Of hard work not at all afraid, 
Nor yet partielar to a 
shade, 
But I 
must go out on Sunday; 
Six days I'll work with all my might - 
To keep the pots and kettles bright, 
And put the cobwebs out of sight, 
But I 
must go out on Sundays. 
Six days, etc. 
When first I 
went to take a 
place, 
The lady looked me in the .face, 
And said, " Young girl, now state your case, 
And what about your Sundays." 
" 
Marm, I 
can bake and I 
can brew 
And I 
can cook an Irish stew, 
And wash a 
shirt and iron it too, 
But I 
must go out on Sundays." 
Six days, etc. 
" 
Indeed ! why then 'tis plain," said she, 
" 
That you will never do for me;" 
I 
took my leave with a 
curtsey, 
Resolved to have my Sundays; 
A 
dozen places more I 
tried 
Throughout great New York City wide, 
But everywhere the ladies cried, 
" 
We don't give out our Sundays." 
Six days, etc. 
(1) 
I MUST GO OUT ON SUNDAY.—Continued. 
At last to bring the fate to book, 
Sly counsel with myself I 
took, 
And got a 
place with Doctor Hook, 
Who never mentioned Sundays; 
But when came round all days the best, 
In pink and green myself I 
dressed, 
And sailed off gayly to the west, 
Like other girls on Sunday. 
Six days, etc. 
With Corporal Tompkins of the Blues, 
So handsome— six feet in his shoes, 
I 
spent the day— did what I 
chose, 
And planned for future Sundays; 
But fancy when I 
homeward sped 
The family was all in bed; 
Says one, who through the keyhole said, 
" 
That's going out on Sunday." 
Six days, etc. 
Now wasn't this a 
pretty plight? 
No friends at hand, locked out all night, 
And told it only served me right 
For going out on Sundays; 
But worse because I 
kicked the door, 
" 
Police !" was called ; there came up four, 
Who took me to—I'll say no more, 
But it wasn't a 
place for Sundays. 
Six days, etc.
