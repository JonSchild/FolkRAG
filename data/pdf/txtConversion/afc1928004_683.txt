OVER THE RIVER. 
WORDS AID MUSIC BY C H. YALE 
SUNG WITH SUCCESS HT WM. C. CAMERON. 
A 
story I 
will tell, 'tis of a 
dashing swell, 
Who dresses in the fashion's latest mold; 
And when he twists his cane, to see it's very plain, 
He imagines that he's as good as gold. 
And when upon the mash he tries to cut a 
ditA, 
With the ladies that he meets upon the way, 
Some wink at him and chaff, while others at him laugh 
And smile at him, as on the sly they say. 
OVer the river, Johnny dear, 
stlike you with a 
feather, you make me feel so queer 
Skip the gutter, darling, you put me in a 
quiver, 
Tra la lee, my baby, and then go o'er the river. 
His eot.t (, f 
Cle latest cut, his vest i 
of seal skin, 
His neck- tie is of yellow, ; rimmed with red; 
His boots tau al:igators with a 
big store- polish shine, 
And his ten eent diamond pin would kill you dead. 
He flirts with all cok,l,s, ; tad gives them killing 
And often at the park he does appear; 
lie hinks he puts on style, but he causes all to smile

Will you take me to the old home, 
Take me back just once again; 
Let me see my dear old mother, 
Or with grief she'll pine away. 
For I 
know she loves her darling, 
And when but a 
little boy, 
I 
would say my evening prayers, 
She would smile with pride and joy.

CHORUS. 
Only take me to the old home, 
Take me back just once again; 
Let me see my darling mother, 
Let me kiss her once again. 
Won't you take me to the old home, 
To the dear place of my birth 
Let me see the dear old homestead, 
Where I 
knew but joy and mirth. 
Let me see the green old meadows, 
With the weeping willow trees, 
For they'll bow their heads in sorrow, 
If 
lAi‘i beneath their leaves.

Bark, I 
hear the church bells ringing, 
Thcy : tro praying for me now; 
I

For my heart seems ligl.t just now. 
And although fate may decree it, 
That I

Still I 
hope that God in mercy, 
Will look down and grant my prayer.

WHAT ARE Y1L W 
Ti JOHN? 
WRIETEN AND sUNG BY HARRY LLOYD, AT 
VOLES THEATRE. 
When I 
was but a 
little koy, 
And school I 
did attend; 
I 
used to do all in my power, 
My teacher to offend. 
When sent up to the board to do a 
sum, 
I'd draw a 
cow; 
My tcacher in a 
rage she would exclaim-
John, what are you up to now. 
CHORUS. 
! 
John, oh! John! 
What are you doing, you'll be my ruin, 
! 
John, oh! John! 
What are you up to now? 
I 
used to know a 
charming girl, 
And Bella was her name, 
And when I 
asked her to be mine, 
She bowed her head with shame. 
I 
put my arm around her waist, 
I 
asked if she'd allow 
Me to kiss her, when she said— 
John what are you up to now. 
ChoruS. 
But since that time I've married been, 
Have a 
child just six months old; 
And to me some funny stories, 
Why my wife Las often told. 
My mother came to see the child, 
And smoothed its little brow. 
Then smiling said, unto my wife, 
What has John been up to now. 
Chorus. 
Spoken; 
Yes, and its the same old story every 
Chorus.

GUESS WHAT IT IS ? 
WRITTEN AND SVNG BY HARRY LLOYD. 
My friends I'm in trouble, 
Why I 
soon will tell; 
Because I 
dress up stylishly, 
And try to cut a 
swell. 
There's a 
gang upon the corner, 
Who when e'er I 
pass them 
Call me by a 
pet name, 
Guess what it is they cry. 
Cnonns. 
What is it. guess ? what is it. guess? 
Oh ! kill it with a 
stick, 
Strike it • vith a 
tomato 
Or hit it with a 
brick. 
! 
tell me is it alive, 
Oh ! stab it with a 
pickle; 
Squash it with a 
rotten egg, 
Or brain it with a 'tickle. 
Last night I 
went out walking, 
Down O'Donavan street; 
Just as I turned the corner, 
I 
there the gang did meet. 
They hallowed ain't he a 
baby ? 
Stag his giblet's gall; 
Pipe his jackets, get on to his socks, 
He's just come from a 
ball. 
Chorus. 
have them all arrested, 
If they do not stop it quick, 
Or else I'll lay some night for them, 
And paste them with a 
brick. 
For they taunt me, call me Horace., 
Then hit me with a 
card, 
And then they said go bag your head. 
And drown yourself in lard.

LOST AND F0'.440, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY HARRY LLOYD. AT 
VOLES THEATRE. 
In traveling on the railroad, just the other day, 
Reaching the daily paper, to pass the time away; 
And heedless of the rate at which the train 
sped o'er the ground, 
I 
was deeply interested in the column, lost and found. 
A 
lady lost her pocket-book, another lost her ring, 
A 
gentleman lost his watch and chain, and a 
handsome diamond pin; 
A boy hacT lost a 
terrier, and a 
book that v. as well bound 
These are the funny things I 
read in the 
column, lost and found. 
A cow was lost or stolen, a 
lady lest her hair, 
A man had found a 
pair of shoes that Wci'i2 Lut 
fit to wear, 
A boy had found an old plug hat, I 
don't know 
what it cost, 
A lady while taking a 
little wiLlk her bustle she 
bad lost, 
A. dress-maker when on a 
drunk, had lost a 
bi-an new dress, 
Which cost about five dollars, a 
hale nou-o 
or less; 
A gentleman when out hunting. La.! I:)st, a 
large blo-hound, 
These are the funny things I 
read in the 
column lost, and f..,and. 
A man had found a 
freight ear stand:ng on ; lie street, 
A 
setirgeant found a 
polic•i•Inli-1 : ii:opEri.; en his beat, 
A man had lost his little son, it re ily was 
quite shocking, 
A woman was found in an alleyway, while 
pulling up her stocking. 
A man had found a 
package he thought he had a 
prize, 
When he opened it he found a 
dead rat in disguise; 
A woman lost her brains, she dropped them on 
the ground, 
These are the funny things I 
read in the 
column lost and found,

One night I 
was invited, 
To attend a

I 
dressed myself up in my best, 
I 
hurried to the hall. 
All sorts were there, I 
do declare, 
And sweet music it was play'd; 
We had a 
jolly racket 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade I 
CHORUS. 
Hands all around, boys! 
Sweet music it was play'd; 
Arrah! forward four, we welt the Boor, 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade. 
At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade— 
aid Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade ! 
Choral 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
He waxed his moustache up with soap, 
He fairly looked immense. 
His hair was tarred with axel grease, 
He had a 
five cent shave; 
It would make you die when to waltz he tried, 
The night of the masquerade.

And its happy we will be in that dear land of the free, 
Living happy with your Barney McCoy. 
I 
would go with you, Barney (-hiding,

You will never see your Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms. Jr.e. 
I 
would go with you, Barney darling, 
If my mother and the rest of them were there, 
For I 
know we wo..dd be blest in that dear land 
of the West, 
Living happy with your Barney McCoy. 
Then come to my arms, dm 
I 
am going far away, Norah Darling, 
And the ship is now anchored in the bay, 
And before to-morrow you will hear the signal gm, 
So be ready, it will carry us away.

I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But tho old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
Cuonus. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone-to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring. 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
When we played on the turnpike gate. 
Chorus.

PARODY ON EMPTY CRADLF, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name was 
Towser Jenkins. 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the eats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
He wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseing milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties him, 
A policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic 
in his grab, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Crtohus. 
He's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting groin& 
He died this morning while the sun was rising; " 
The flees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizemed. 
Oh! how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at him, 
lie used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseing cats around corn cribs, 
Had bunions on his knees from jumping ditches, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
Where the rats chewed off his whiskers, 
When lie was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Cnonrs. 
He has, gone to hunt for liver, 
Way acrossed the Swanee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise him, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin can's upon his tail, 
Empty is the dog-liouse-TowSer's nizened. 
SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
A.60,41i.o64, 
-14— 
RECITED BY GUS wumms. 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long, 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout, 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman SO old and gray, 
Hastened the children on their way. 
one offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Leat the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery street 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low, 
"I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand. on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
Be guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
Eris young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She -s, somebody's mothcr, boys, yon know, 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand 
To help my mother—yon understand! 
if ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
" 
Somebody's mother." bowed low her hea,d, 
In her home that night, and the prayer she soh" 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
'Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and worn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
A.Agele caught the faltering word, 
And 
Somebody's mother's" prayer was hand.

was young. 
When the autumn days had come, I 
would 
husk the yellow cork. 
In the fields I 
was singing all the day, 
Ind before they made me free I 
had never cause 
o mourn; 
And, around the old place everything waS gay; 
And many and many a 
time when the work of

With 
melody the old plantation rung, 
Ind my heart does often long for the happy 
days of yore,

It was over at old Regan's house, we had a 
jolly time, 
There was lots of dancing, I 
tell you it was fine, 
Oh! the boys and girls enjoyed themselves, for 
they came far and near, 
And all the lads assembled there, to try old 
Regan's beer. 
Old Regan he felt lively for a 
time, 
And a 
happier man I 
don't think could be found, 
He told us that the house was ours, to do just as 
we liked, 
So then we had a 
drink of bear all round, 
Cnouns. 
Oh such singing, and such dancing pon my 
word ' twas really grand, 
And the music sounded just as well as if it was a 
band, 
While Murphy played the fiddle, they danced 
up and down the middle, 
And we never left old Regan till the morn. 
There was Mary Jones and Jerry Flynn got up 
to dance a 
jig, 
Along with Michael Cronin's wife, who looked 
like Murphy's pig, 
The floor they welted beautiful, and went round 
hand in hand, 
But Cronin's wife she danced so much that sho 
could hardly stand, 
Then James O'Brien he got up to sing a 
song, 
But they did not seem to relish it one bit, 
They yanked him out so gently that he thought 
his time had come, 
And the poor old fellow fell into a 
fit. 
Chorus. 
They danced away till broad daylight, the sun 
broke in the sky, 
But McCarthy's wife was so fatigued, she thought 
she'd really die, 
M'Guinness got overpowered on wine and lager beer, 
He felt so good he tried to do a 
pirouette on his ear, 
And poor old Jerry Dolan was found sleeping 
With a 
vice like grip upon a 
china cup, 
And when they danced the last quadrille the 
fiddler fell asleep, 
And that's what wound old Regan's party up.

By my dress you can see I'm a true son of Mars; 
Tho' for fighting and blood-shed I'm not much careing, 
I'll show no white feather it' sent to the wars.

I'm bothered, yes, I'm bothered, 
Completely perplexed; 
I'm the father of a 
little boy, 
I'm not happy, but. I'm vexed. 
I 
have ninety-nine relations, 
And they nearly drive me wild, 
Both one and all, both great and small, 
They want to name the child..

My wife she wants him Michael, 
Her sister wants him Nlatt,

Whilst her aunty wants him Pat. 
Whilst ny tuother wants him Shamus. 
And my faller wants him Paul, 
I 
do declare, I 
don't know what, 
I'll name the child at all.

Sure I 
thought I'd make a

So I 
am here to greet you all, 
And to thank ye for yere welcome to a 
stranger; 
I 
got a 
job of work, 
Since I 
landed in New York, 
But my work is attended with great danger, 
For a 
mason's clerk am I, 
One whose always climbing high, 
And the hod and ladder is my occupation; 
But for politics I'm bound, 
And I'm bound to get around, 
To assist in making laws for this great nation. 
CHORUS. 
Paddy Duffy is my2aame, 
I 
will always be th4same, 
Whether rich or poor, of high or low degree; 
Like Muldoon the solid guy, 
A 
bold specimen am I, 
Of a 
self-made, high-toned gentleman, you see! 
(Dance.) 
One day while on the ladder, 
Oh! I 
never yet got madder, 
Then I 
did upon that very same occasion; 
Some bricks fell from my hod, 
And lit upon the nob 
Of a 
German peddlar of the Jew persuasion; 
Sheeney called hard names to Pat, 
For the bricks had broke his hat; 
I 
was angry, and the truth I 
had to tell, 
Oh ! sez I, you dirty Jew, 
But for your ancestors, like you, 
The Lord would be au i 
ye to- day, and doing well

I'm a 
true-hearted boy from the green shores of Erin, 
That" Emerald" set in the sea, 
Where bounteous nature her best doth appear in; 
And choicest of gifts scatters free. 
Our mountains and valleys with produce abounding. 
Our rivers and lakes filled with life galore, 
Loveliest scenes on all sides there surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, mad Ireland asthore. 
Cnouns. 
Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless around it the rude billows roar, 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Dear Grannuail thy daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in scoan. 
Our hearts ever open to welcome _a

Those in distress never turned from the door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, - 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore.

Firm in our hearts all the wide world o'et4, 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it no never;

Memory gently leads me backward to the shores 
of long ago, 
Bright with many recollections clear to me; 
Happy faces smile upon me mid the breaking 
o'er the strand, 
Of the silvery surges made by memory's sea. 
Childhood's playmates cluster round me, friends 
of manhood's sterner years, 
Who have ceased the weary paths of life to roam; 
But amid the throng of faces there is one I 
treasure most, 
Of a 
mother whom the angels beckoned home. 
CHORUS. 
'Tis the vision of my mother, she who rocked 
me when a 
babe, 
And who guarded me within my cradle nest; 
Earthly riches I 
would part with, just to hear 
her voice again, 
Of that mother whom the angels called to rest.

.She it was who softly murmured loving words 
above my head, 
As she held me ere she laid me down to sleep; 
And through weary hours of danger, every 
effort gladly madok, 
For my comfort, while she oft would o'er me weep. 
Faintly I 
can still remember songs of melody she sang, 
Prayers she offered that I 
might be always blest, 
But at last she left her treasure to the Saviour's 
watchful care, 
For the angels beckoned her to come and rest. 
I 
have passed those youthful hours and have 
grown to manhood's age, 
Still my fancy often bids me backward stray. 
To the sunny days of childhood when the 
hours were sweetly spent, 
With the loved one lying now beneath the clay. 
Childhood's prayers will have been answered 
when at last my life is o'er, 
And I'll deem myself forever blessed, 
Can I 
meet again and listen to the one I've 
treasured del!, 
Whom the angels beckoned home with them to rot

In eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight, 
But for the poor ones they did hunt; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
CHORUS. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone-; 
until we found our enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
So no* me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman, 
For,Paddies door is open for you, 
With a 
warm and welcome hand. 
I 
hope the day is not very far off, 
When old Ireland shall have her rights, 
And that little green banner float in victory, 
Along with the Stars and Stripes.

BE HOME EARLY TO- NIGHT, MY 
DEAR BOY. 
IRMO WITH GREAT SUCCESS BY MISS QUEEN HETHERTON. 
AND LEW BAKER. 
have traveled through life, I 
have seen many things, 
That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'Till dark, and at sunrise in the morn. 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure thro' town, 
I 
was always for pleasure and joy; 
My mother would say when going away, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, + o-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead: 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Cho, 
All young men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend, 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are many things you can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I 
give'twas a 
mother's request, 
Keep good hours at night my dear boys.

The old willow chair now so aged And worn, 
Where grandmother sat years before I 
was born. 
Though covered with dust. and so near as decay, 
Is dear to my heart in it.; treasures to-day. 
There often my mother would rock me to sleep, 
And when I 
was young o'er my fevered cheek weeps 
And then I 
would list to her low fervent prayer, 
While held in her arms, in the oil willow chair. 
It rocked me by day, and it rocked me by night, 
While with us sweet sons tilled my heart with dash% 
And then her dear lips, would repeat a 
low prayer, 
While holding ine safe in the old willow chair. 
I 
do not remember my grandmother 
For when she went home I 
was only a 
child ; 
But mother has told me again and again, 
How calmly she bore all the long years of pale. 
By day and by night, she was happy 014 say, 
In rockin, the hours and the moments away, 
And this is the present she left to our care, 
The best of all treasures her oid willow chair.

It stood in the kitchen, long, long years ago, 
Through many a 
season of sunshine and snow, 
The old will w 
chair that our grandmother made, 
And wl'ere in the slumbers of youth I 
was laid, 
And there in the days I 
now love to recall, 
it was by our circle most treasured oi

relic so rare, 
AU aoyered with webs stands the old willow eluett.

To give my charmer fair.

Half hid her face in shadow. 
But when e're I

They shone like diamonds there; 
She's as pretty as a

twas time to go, we talked so low, 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport ' twas cupid caught, 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
told her so as I 
turned to 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she drooped her bead, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you " au revoir." 
She's as pretty as a

And my heart's a

MAN YOU DOWT MEET 
EVERY 
DAY. 
re a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och! I 
didn't conic here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
C
HORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you don't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •‘ ray spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you conic over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen, 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day-.

How are yous one and all, 
Sure we thot' we'd snake a 
call, 
And tell you all about the widow's party, 
'Twas at Paythogoras Hall, 
We gave a 
break- down ball, 
And invited all the young filks gay and hearty, 
There was handsome Paddy Grace, 
Sure he's now on the police, 
He was put thete by a 
pel-i-tic-al party. 
He came from County Cork, 
To the City of New York, 
He joked and sang and made us all feel hearty. 
CHORUS. 
Ah ! the charming Widow Clancy, 
She was any man's fancy, 
She was a 
fluent talker, and a 
rattling six-day walke4 
And a 
Venus is the charming Widow Clancy. 
McGinn sang Pin-a- fore, 
Till his throat was very sore, 
And " Little Dudeen," sang by Smith so sweetly, 
Crosby sang a 
little ditty, 
The girls all called hint witty, 
And McGuffin done an Irish jig so neatly. 
Flynn sang, " Dancing on the green," 
Also " She's a 
fairy queen." 
Fkod sang " Hold the fort for we're the 
strongest party," 
And Murphy and iirn Lang, 
Done the Lack-a-wan-na Gang, 
Down at the charming Widow Clancy's party. Cho. 
As it was growing late, 
Sure we tho't was time to ate, 
We went in two by two's down to the supper, 
We were hardly seated right, 
When there was a 
fearful fight, 
For McGthIness swore the whiskey was all water, 
All around ' twas hand to hand, 
And they nearly killed the band, 
When in stepped the famous boxer Mike McCarthy, 
He swore by the powers above, 
That he'd just put on the gloves, 
And clear out every sucker in the party. 
Chorus.

Last winter was a 
hard one, Mrs. Reilv did you say, 
Well, ' tis myself that knows it, for it's many's the day, 
Your husband wasn't the only man sat behind the wall, 
There's my old man McGninees didn t 
get no job at all. 
The politicians promised him work om the Boulevard, 
To handle a 
pick and shovel and throw dirt on the cart. 
Ahl six months ago they promised hint work he'd shortly gni 
but believe Ine, my good woman, they are promising hint yet.. 
CHORUS 
Then cheer up, Mrs. Reily and dtn't give way to the blues,. 
You and I 
will cut a 
shine, with new bonnets and new shoes; 
As for me I'm done crying, no more will I 
sigh or sob, 
wait till times get better, when McGuinness gets a 
job. 
The Italians, divil take them, why didn't they stay at home, 
Shure we had plenty of our own class to ate up all our own; 
They come out like bees in summer time and sworn for to stay; 
The contractors they have hundreds for forty cents a 
day, 
They work upon the railroad, they shovel snow and slush, 
but there's one thing in their favor, Italians they 
never do ge' 
No, they always bring th, ir money home, taste no gi 
And that one thing I'd like to say of your old m-
! 
the spring time now is coming we'r 
MeGuiness will go back to hie trade, 
Yon eoould see him clitnbthe lade 
Faith he's the boy can handle 
The boss is always bawling, 
Keep your eyes turned upwa 
Ah 
the old man he is ale' 
The divil a 
word you'd he

Here we are two factory lads, 
From Lancashire we came, 
Our parents in the cotton mill 
Are working now at home. 
But trade was slack, and pay is bad, 
So they sent us here 
To try and show you all the way 
They dance in Lancashire. 
CHORUS. 
We will make the wooden clogs go tap, tap, tar, 
If you'll but give a 
cheer, 
And ' twill give us great delight, 
To show you here to-night, 
How they dance in Lancashire. 
When at night our work is done, 
We dance out on the green, 
The lads and lassies all are there, 
With smiling faces seen. 
Now we've told you all our history, 
If you think us sincere, 
Bestow your kind applause upon 
These lads from Lancashire.

I 
have a 
daughter of great renown, 
In the ballet she dances in a 
theatre up town; 
She's a 
darling to me, and so pretty you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She wears tarletan skirts all covered with tin, 
She's as an angel a 
soul without sin; 
She's a 
dancer, you see, in the tra-la-la-lee, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
CHORuS. 
She waltzes and pivots so neat on her toes, 
As 'round and 'round and 'round she goes; 
Now there's one thing sure I 
can't understand, 
Why her name on the bills should read 
Madam Du Rand, 
She high-tened wants to be, but she's Irish you see, 
And her right name is Biddy McGee, 
(sym.) 
(sYm.) 
I 
taught her the skip, the hop, and the dip, 
To the tune of a 
fiddle around she would trip, 
She's of high degree, and takes after me, 
Doe's this girl of mine, Biddy McGee. 
She's a 
voice like a 
bell, though I 
never could tell, 
'Where she got it, or how, ' tis a 
mystery as well; 
For she's so full of glee, when dancing you see, 
Is this girl of mine, Biddy McGee.

Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS.

temper that don't last very long, 
• nt lb fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don I 
sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true- man. 
Chorus, 
Remember the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country or queen,

On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
.0h! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
-Go yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh ! don't tkey one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chorus, 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and mak 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorws. 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song, 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night.
