[Letter from Harold Spivacke to Carita Doggett Corse,
October 2, 1939]
October 2, 1939
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor Statewide Writers' Project Works Progress
Administration of Florida 40 West Duval Street Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
In answer to your letter of September 25, permit me to tell you that it is not our desire to
place any restrictions on the duplicates in the possession of the Florida Music and Writers'
Projects. It goes without saying that all privileges should be extended to Professor Morris
who has worked with the Archive in the past. In fact, if, when the formal application for
extension of this project is made, you call attention to the fact that Professor Morris is your
consultant, I believe that this will strengthen your case materially.
Sincerely yours, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
