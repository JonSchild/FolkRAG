INTRODUCTION. 
TO THE PUBLI C. 
• 
IN 
bringing before you these Temperance Songs and other 
pieces, which I 
have composed during my leisure hours, I 
do 
so at the earnest request of good and true men in the cause of 
temperance, and my great desire to help the good work all I 
can ; at the same time, conscious of my inability as a 
writer, I 
hope you will pardon any faults, and consider my zeal in the 
cause an excuse for any errors I 
may commit. I 
think and 
feel that every good citizen should do something to stop the 
great and growing vice of rum drinking. 
Every man can do 
some good—no matter how small his ability. 
Therefore, I 
cheerfully and hopefully give my mite, and ask the co-operation 
of my fellow citizens in this great and holy work. I 
have seen 
crime in all its forms traced to rum. 
The high and low give 
way to its cursed influence. 
The bravest and best are alike de-
praved by it. 
I 
have seen its evil effects in both military and 
civil life, and know its blighting effects on all. 
I 
hope the day 
will soon come when drunkenness will he one of the evils of the 
past, and the rumseller, like Othello's occupation, gone; then 
will mankind be what God intended they should be—happy, 
cheerful, and contented, better men and good citizens. 
Hop-
ing this little hook might he the means of doing some good in 
the cause of temperance and morality, 
I 
am your oh't servant, 
PATRICK KELLY 
NEW YORK, OCT. 7, 1874.

DO THE BEST YOU CAN. 
By CAPT. P. 
K ELLY. 
The Music of this song can be obtained at DrrsoN's Music Store, 711 
Broadway. 
THIS life is but a 
game of chance, there's many ups and downs, 
From youth to age the road is hard when fortune on us frowns, 
Toil, sweat, and poverty our lot, cold, weary, pale, and wan ; 
We must endure, and if we're poor let's do the best we can. 
There's many ups and downs, my boys; this life is but a 
span ; 
Should Fortune frown don't be cast down, but do the best you 
can. 
The proud and grand may dress in robes and live in splendid 
ease, 
For wealth can pamper to their taste, bring everything they 
please, 
In coaches Timid with satin roll, and drive a 
costly span ; 
The poor, I 
find, must walk behind, and do the best they can 
There's many, etc 
The world is wide, there's room for all, a 
maxim old and true; 
Then help a 
brother in distress, and give each man his due; 
Be kind to all who need your aid, assist your fellow- man— 
A 
friend in need is one indeed, then do the best you can. 
There's many, etc. 
Old age may steal the fire of youth, my sight pews dim with 
years, 
And sorrow darkens all my joys, my cheeks bedew with tears; 
I'll bear it all without a 
sigh and smile at fortune's ban, 
With cheerful heart will act my part, and do the, best I 
can. 
There's many, etc. 
TEMPERANCE OPENiNG SONG. 
INVITATION TO JOIN. 
Ata.—" Johnny, Fill up the Bowl." 
Dedicated to the Coldwater Army by CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
As temperance men we take our stand, 
hurrah ! hurrah! 
And in the cause work heart and hand, 
Hurrah ! hurrah ! 
For rum vil1 bring you to disgrace, 
Swell your head and bloat your face; 
Then all drink water now; come, fill up the bowl, 
Then all drink water now; come, fill up the bowl. 
Cold water is the drink for me, 
Hurrah I 
hurrah ! 
It gives health and prosperity, 
Hurrah! hurrah ! 
For rum will set your brain on fire, 
And lead you into filth and mire. 
Then all drink, etc. 
Now come up here, my friend, I 
pray, 
hurrah ! hurrah ! 
And sign the pledge without delay, 
Hurrah ! hurrah ! 
For rum will lead to vice and crime— 
So now, my friends, take heed in time, 
And all drink, etc. 
Then come up here and sign to- night, 
hurrah ! hurrah ! 
For every one we do invite, 
Hurrah ! hurrah ! 
Then banish sorrow from your door, 
have peace and plenty evermore, 
And all drink, etc, 
THE EVILS OF INTEMPERANZI,E. 
A IR.—" The Men of ' 82." 
By CAPT. P. 
K ELLY. 
DEAR friends, to you a 
word or two, 
Who drink rum, wine, and beer ; 
The tempting glass now let it pass, 
Come up and join us here. 
CHORUS. 
The cursed bowl it damns the soul, 
And makes a 
hell of life; 
Each murder case to rum we trace, 
The pistol club, and knife. 
How oft we seek black misery 
And ruin in the ctp; 
For all who drink will deeper sink 
In sorrow as they sup. 
The cursed bo-d, etc. 
For many years poor women's tears 
In want and grief are shed; 
Abuse and blows, received from those 
Who should protect and aid. 
The cursed bowl, etc. 
Intemperance will the prisons fill, 
The scaffold does supply , 
The fearful tide of suicide, 
From rum how many die. 
The cursed bowl, etc. 
When men become a 
slave to rum, 
They soon are lost to shame ; 
Good and brave fill the drunkard's grave— 
Their end will be the same. 
The cursed bowl, etc. 
KELLY'S ADVICE TO BUMMERS. 
A IR. -" Independence Day." 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
Now all young fellows on the bum, 
Turrin nadi, turrin nadi, 
Who spend your time in drl'nking rum, 
Turrin nurrin nadi, 
And always ready for a 
nip, 
Turrin nadi, turrin nadi, 
Come sign the pledge and let them rip, 
Turrin nurrin nadi. 
Now bid good-bye to brandy smash, I 
Turrin nadi, turrin nadi ; 
Hot whiskey skins and all such trash, 
Turrin nurrin nadi; 
There's bourbon sour too, let it slide, 
Turrin nadi, turrin nadi ; 
The pledge it is your only guide, 
Turrin nurrin nadi. 
The big bugs they do drink champagne, 
Turrin nadi, turrin nadi ; 
Old soakers take their whiskey plain, 
Turrin nurrin nadi ; 
Now lager beer is only swill, 
Turrin nadi, turrin nadi, 
And like the rest is made to kill, 
Turrin nurrin nadi. 
Blue devils hi cocktails you'll find, 
Turrin nadi. turrin nadi ; 
Hot rum it will destroy the mind, 
Turin nurrin nadi ; 
Take my advice and bck a 
T. A. B., 
Turrin nadi, turrin nadi, 
And make rumsellers hold their gab, 
Turrin nurrin nadi.

THE BOYS ARE NOT SO GREEN. 
AIR.—" Wearing of the Green." 
By CAPT. P. 
K ELLY. • 
MY 
friends, come near and you will hear the news that's go-
ing around— 
King Alcohol will soon be dead and buried under ground ; 
The rumsellers will shut up shop—no drunkards will be seen, 
For drinking whiskey is played out—the boys are not so ()Teen. 
I 
met a 
Father Mathew man—he took me by the hand, 
lie told me how the temperance cause is spreading through our 
land ; 
Bad luck attend their dirty trade, the rumsellers I 
mean, 
For drinking whiskey is played out—the boys are not so green. 
I 
hope the day is drawing- near and soon will come around, 
When drunken men and women nowhere can be found ; 
Then peace and plenty we will have, joy everywhere be seen, 
For drinking Nvbibkey is played out— the boys are not so green. 
Now, ladies, pay attention, a 
word I'll say to you— 
Show your husbands an example, and tell them what to do, 
Tell your brothers and your sweethearts in no rumshops to be 
seen, 
For drinking whiskey is played out, and not to be so green. 
Now burry up and sign the pledge—come here and take your 
stand, 
And be a 
Father Mathew man— come join our gallant band; 
Now, boys, fall in, and give them fits, the runise:lers I 
mean. 
For drinking whiskey is played out, and we are not so green. 
MY FRIENDS THEY HARDLY KNEW ME. 
Ant..—" Johnny, I 
hardly Knew You." 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
A 
NICE young man I 
used to be, a- boo, a-boo, 
A 
nice young man I 
used to be, a-hoe, 
A 
nice young man I 
used to be— 
A poor old bummer now you see, 
For whiskey got the best of me— 
My friends they hardly knew me. 
CHORUS. 
With drunken bums and whiskey plums, 
The rot- gut nearly slew me; 
I'd drink my fill of rum, until 
My friends they hardly knew me. 
On fancy drinks I 
did begin, a-boo, a-boo, 
On fancy drinks I 
did begin, a- boo, 
On fancy drinks I 
did begin, 
Champagne and wine, then whiskey skin; 
Look at me now—Pin all caved in— 
My friends they hardly know Inc. 
With drunken bums, etc. 
When on a 
bust don't care a 
fig, a-hoo, a-hoo, 
When on a 
bust don't care a 
fig, a 
hoo, 
When on a 
bust don't care a 
fig, 
As large as life and twice as big, 
My jaws are like a 
sucking pig; 
My friends will never know me. 
With drunken bums, etc. 
From bad to worse I 
daily went, a-boo, a-boo, 
From bad to worse I 
daily went, a-hoo, 
From bad to worse I 
daily went, 
My credit gone and money spent; 
So here I 
am without a 
cent— 
Mv friends will never know me. 
With drunken bums, etc. 
So now, my boys, I 
bid good-bye, a-hoo, a-hoo, 
So now, my boys, I 
bid good-bye, a-boo, 
So now, my boys, I 
bid good-bye, 
To bourbon cocktails and old rye; 
A 
sober life I'm bound to try; 
Then all my friends will know me. 
CHORUS. 
No more with bums or whiskey plums, 
The rot- gut will go through me; 
From gin and beer my head is clear, 
And all my friends will know me.

THE POOR OLD SPORT, 
AND ALL TH AT. 
AIR.—" A 
Man's a 
Man for a' That." 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
I 
eel' a 
dash when I 
had cash, a 
bank account, and all that, 
Where'er I 
went my money spent—I 
made it fly, and all that, 
And all that ; for all that gay times I 
had, and all that; 
Now I'm done brown upon the town, with nary red, for all that. 
You bet your pile I 
lived in style, big suppers, game, and all 
that; 
On quail and wine I 
used to dine, get jolly tight, and all that, 
And all that ; for all that now things are changed, and all that; 
It's turn about, I 
go without, I 
live on wind for all that. 
Fine horses, too, I 
had a 
few, fast trotters gay, and all that, 
In style and speed I 
took the lead—blood will tell, and all that, 
And all that; for all that I 
made things hum, and all that; 
I 
took the whip and let her rip, two-forty gait, and all that. 
I 
lived too fast, it could not last, run through my pile, and all 
that ; 
I 
tried my luck, and used to buck the tiger, too, and all that, 
And all that ; for all that my money flew, and all that; 
I 
found the same a 
losing game, ' twas ten to one, and all that. 
Look at my nose and seedy clothes, no fine things now, and all 
that; 
They're up the spout, and I'm played out, a 
healthy beat, and 
all that, 
And all that; for all that the boys shake me now, and all that; 
A poor old bum, a 
slave to rum, I 
am going to rack, and all 
that. 
My bumming's o'er, I'll drink no more, but sign the pledge, and 
all that; 
From want and grief it brings relief to sots like me, and all that, 
And all that; for all that I'll drink cold water now, and all that; 
For Kelly says good temperate ways will make the man, for all 
that. 
THF: BOYS WHO TIP THE G LASSES, 
O H I 
Am.—" Green Grow the Rushes, Oh I", 
By CAPT. P. KELLY. 
A 
TEMPERATE man, God's noblest work, 
All others he surpasses, oh! 
In mind and soul, above the whole 
Of those who tip the glasses, oh! 
CHORUS. 
When you feel dry, cold water try, 
It every drink surpasses, oh ! 
And free to all, both great and small, 
Come, drink you, lads and lasses, oh !: 
Our temperance cause is growing strong 
Among all creeds, and classes, oh! 
For rum destroys the hopes and joys 
Of those who tip the glasses oh ! 
When you feel dry, etc. 
We see them falling day by day, 
By drinking rum, the masses, oh! 
•For some men swill, and drink until 
They're stupid as blind asses, oh! 
When you feel dry, etc. 
Then let the work go bravely on, 
In spite of knaves and asses, oh! 
Who trade in sin, and rot-gut gin, 
To poison all the masses, oh! 
When you feel dry, etc.

THE DRUNKARD'S APPEAL. 
Ain.—" Swinging in the Lane." 
By CAPT. P. 
K ELLY. 
Now come, my friends, and sign 
abstain ; 
The cursed vice of drinking rum 
How oft I 
spent my hard-earned 
gin, 
To rob me of my silly brains and 
the pledge from whiskey to 
brings misery and pain ; 
gains for whiskey, beer, and 
steep my soul in sin. 
CHORUS. 
Come up, my friends, and sign the pledge from whiskey to ab-
stain; 
Don't put a 
thief into your mouth to steal away your brain. 
I 
used to drink and sport around, and spend my money free, 
Would leave my poor forsaken wife in want and misery; 
My children without food or fire in anguish to remain; 
Of drinking rum I'd never tire— it rob'd me of my brain. 
Come up, etc. 
I've been a 
poor degraded sot these long and many years, 
And travelled down that fearful road to misery and tears, 
in ragged clothe—no friend to cheer—in winter's snow and 
rain, 
By drinking whiskey, ruin, and beer, which rob'd me of my 
brain. 
Conic up, etc. 
Now I 
have changed my wicked course, and lead a 
sober life; 
I've signed the pledge, and bless the day—I 
feel no want or 
strife; 
Now everything seems joy to me—I'll never drink again, 
For I 
gave up the cursed cup that rob'd me of my brain. 
Come up, etc. 
Then conic, my friends, and sign the pledge, before it is too 
late, 
And leave that cursed cup alone, to shun the drunkard's fate ; 
Come, pledge yourselves as sober men, and the holy cause sus-
tain, 
And ne'er become a

DON'T SELL MY FATHER RUM. 
A B EAUTIFUL TEMPERANCE BALLAD. 
DON'T sell him another drink, please, 
He's reeling already, you see, 
And I 
fear when he comes home to- night 
he'll beat poor mother and me ; 
She's waiting in darkness and cold, 
And dreading to hear him conic ; 
He treats us so bad when he's drunk, 
Oh ! don't sell him any more rum! 
CHORUS. 
Don't sell him another drink, please, 
He's reeling already, you see, 
And I 
fear when he comes home to- night 
He'll beat poor mother and me. 
I 
heard mother praying last night, 
She thought I 
was quite sound asleep, 
She prayed God her husband to save, 
his soul from temptation to keep ; 
She cried like her poor heart would break ; 
So, trying to comfort her some, 
I 
told her I'd beg you to day 
Not to sell father any more rum. 
Don't sell him another, etc. 
Why don't you have something to sell 
That will not make people so sad ; 
That will not make dear mothers grieve, 
And kind fathers cruel and bad 7 
Ali me ! it is hard ; I 
can see 
You're angry because I 
have conic 
Forgive a 
poor, sad little girl, 
.A.nd don't sell her dear father rum ! 
D-n't si•!1 him anolier, etc.

KILLARIZEY..-1_CoNcLuDLD. I 
Innisfallen's ruined shrine 
May suggest a 
passing sigh ; 
But man's faith can ne'er decline, 
Such God's wonders floating by. 
Castle Lough and Glenn Bay, 
Mountains Tore and Eagles' Nest, 
Still at Mucross you must pray, 
Though the monks are now at rest. 
Angels wonder not that man 
There would fain prolong life's span 
Beauty's home, Killarney-, 
Ever fair Killarney. 
No place else can charm the eye 
With such bright and varied tints, 
Every rock that you pass by, 
Verdure broiders or besprints ; 
Virgin there the green grass grows, 
Every morn spring's natal day, 
Bri;ht-hued berries doff the snows, 
Smiling winter's frown away. 
Angels often pausing there, 
Doubt if Eden were more fair : 
Beauty's home, Killarney 
Ever fair Killarney. 
Music there for echo dwells, 
Makes each sound a 
harmony, 
Many-voiced the chorus swells, 
Till it faints in ecstasy. 
With the charmful tints below 
Seems the heaven above to vie, 
All rich colors that we know, 
Tinge the cloud-wreaths in that sky, 
Wings of angels so might shine, 
Glancing back soft light divine : 
Beauty's home, Killarney, 
Ever fair Killarney.

COME HOME, 
FATEfER .. 
W ords and Music by HENRY CLAY -VOR.. 
Father, door father, come home with me now, 
The clock in the stoeple strikes one; 
You said you were coming right home from the shop, 
As soon as your day's work was done. 
Our fire has gone out, our house is all dark, 
And mother's been watching since tea, 
With poor brother Benny so sick in her arms, 
And no one to help her but me. 
Come home! come home! come home! 
Please, father, dear father, come home! 
CHORUS. 
Hear the sweet voice of the child, 
Which the night-winds repeat, as they roam! 
Oh! who could resist this most plaintive of pra..-ers; 
Please, father, dear father, come home 
Father, dear father, come home with me now, 
The clock in the steeple strikes two; 
The night has grown colder, and Benny is worse; 
But he has been calling for you 
Indeed he is worse, ma says he will die— 
Perhaps before morning shall dawn. 
And this is the message she sent me to bring; 
Come quickly, or he will be gone! 
Come home! come home! come home I 
Please. father, dear father, come home! 
Hear the sweet voice, &c 
Father, dear father, come home with me now, 
The clock in the steeple strikes three; 
The house is so lonely, the hours are so long 
For poor weeping mother and me 1 
Yes, we are alone; for Benny is dead, 
And gone with the angels of light. 
And these were the very last words that he said:, 
I 
want to kiss papa good-night. 
Come home ! come home! come home I 
Please, father, dear father, come home 
Hear the sweet voice, ike. 
FATHER'S COME HOME, 
A 
sequel to: " Come Home, Father." 
Yes, Mary, my Mary, your father's come home, 
You waited through all the long night, 
He was deaf to your pleadings, for, reason was drowned-
But, oh! it came back with the light. 
It seems like a 
dream, oh! a 
terrible dream— 
But, alas! now I 
know it was true: 
Poor Benny is dead, but your father's come home, 
Dear Mary, to mother and you. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
no more, through the dark, weary hours, 
Little Mary in sadness shall roam, 
Ah 1 
how glad to her ears are the words which she hears: 
Dear Mary, your father's come home ! 
Please, Mary, tell mother that father's come home, 
And kneels by our little boy's bed; 
And he prays for God's help, that the husband may fill 
The place of the boy that is dead; 
And say, though he left her forsaken to weep, 
All alone to bear sorrow and pain, 
He'll never more cause her a 
pang or a 
tear, 
If once more she will trust him again. 
CHORUS. 
Ohl no more shall the wife watch and. weep, 
All in vain for the loved one to come; 
And all gone are her fears, as the nessage she hears: 
Tell mother that father's come home. 
Yes, Mary, tell mother that father has left 
The drink that has made him so bad; 
You can say he has taken the Temperance-Pledge, 
I 
know it will make her heart glad; 
And tell her he waits to clasp mother and child, 
And vow, on his knees, to be true; 
For father's come home, to his reason, at length, 
Dear Mary, to mother and you! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! no more, to the mother and child, 
Shall the night black and desolate come— 
For, the fire shall be bright, and their hearth shall be light, 
While saying: Dear Father's come home 1

But judge not too harshly, I

But to my transgressions, I've bidden adieu, 
Then, Father, forgive me, I

I've sinned against heaven and thee; 
I 
ask but a 
place in the old cottage home, 
Once more your own Tommy to be. 
The fancies I 
cherished so fondly in youth. 
Long, long, since have vanished away, 
The counsels you gave me, I 
found to be true, 
Then, Father forgive me, I 
pray! 
0

Again and again, I've repented in ica7r, 
And prayed to my Father above, 
My sins to forgive, to remove all my fears, 
He heard me in mercy and love. 
Forgiveness, dear Father, and Mother, I 
crave, 
For the sorrow I 
caused you to know, 
For God in his mercy is able to save, 
Your Tommy from ruin and woe.

LINCOLN'S ADDRESS. 
AIR -" Bruce's Address." 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
W HEN traitors fired on our flag, 
Loudly then did boast and brag, 
The stars and bars would be the rag 
Of Southern chivalry. 
Their cursed work they first begun 
On Sumter's walls, near Charleston, 
Defended by brave Anderson, 
With Spartan bravery. 
Every means they sought and tried 
Our glorious Union to divide— 
Seized our fo.rts, our laws defied, 
To rend our unity. 
They trampled all was good and just, 
Our good old flag trail'd in the dust, 
Our soldiers into prison thrust, 
And Union men to flee. 
Freemen, aroused, armed for the fray, 
To wipe foul treason's stain away ; 
God grant we soon shall see the day 
Brings peace and victory. 
A 
nation mourns her fallen slain, 
Who died for freedom not, in vain ; 
They break the captive's g,alling chain, 
And set, the bondma free. 
THE GRAND POTOMAC ARMY. 
Respectfully dedicated to the Grand Army of the Potomac 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
BRAVE comrades, join me in three cheers, 
And wipe away all bitter tears, 
That wet our cheeks for many years 
In the Grand Potomac Army. 
We give our heart and hand to those 
Who met us in the field as foes, 
Our malice ended with our blows, 
In the Grand Potomac Army. 
Peace and good- will we cherish still, 
In the Grand Potomac Army. 
To all who nobly led the van, 
In freedom's cause to every man, 
To glorious GRANT and SHERIDAlsr, 
Of the Grand Potomac Army. 
To Little Mac, the soldier's pride, 
And gallant Meade, the true and tried, 
Old Fighting Joe and brave Burnside, 
Of the Grand Potomac Army. 
Each honored name will live in fame, 
Of the Grand Potomac Army. 
Now smiling peace has come again, 
No warrior's blood was shed in vain, 
And glory crowns the valiant slain, 
Of the Grand Potomac Army. 
To fallen braves the good and true, 
Each gallant heart who wore the blue, 
A 
laurel wreath we weave for you, 
Of the Grand Potomac Army. 
Each passing year we prize more dear 
In the Grand Potomac Army.

COME all true sons of Erin, now wherever you may be, 
Unite, and work together, boys, the dear old land to free; 
For years we've been in bondage, oppressive wrongs we've bore, 
With sword and pike then rise and strike for liberty once more. 
CHOWS. 
Conic rally round the green flag, come rally round the Green,

With brave Hancock, dashing Kearney, in Meagher's wild brig-
ade, 
With Irish pluck, boys, trust to luck, our good right arm and 
blade.

The time has come for action, now no longer fawn or crave, 
No longer kneel to tyrants base, or be a 
coward slave; 
Rise in your might for fatherland, from mountain, plain, to sea, 
Come, do or die, our battle cry, Erin and Liberty. 
Come rally, etc. 
Remember Robert Emmett, brave Fitzgerald, and Wolf Tone, 
Who died to free our native land from the British throne ; 
Then conic, my boys, united be, true, firm in heart and hand, 
God in His might, defend the right, and free out native land.

W HEN treason was rampant and spread o'er the land, 
Secession defiant, then took a 
bold stand, 
I 
joined the brave army like a 
veteran so true, 
To fight for the Union, the Red, White, and Blue. 
CHORUS. 
Come, fall in, my brave boys, like veterans so true, 
And fight for the Union, the Red, White, and Blue. 
A-scouting we go, over bills, through the wood, 
And sometimes are up to our knees in the mud, 
Without any rations, and barefooted too, 
To conquer or die for the Red, White, and Blue. 
Come, fall in, etc. 
When night comes we station our pickets around, 
Then roll in our, 
blankets and sleep on the ground ; 
The dear ones at home in visions we view, 
While guarding the Union, the Red, White, and Blue. 
Come, fall in, etc. 
We rise in the morning before break of day, 
Eat hard- tack and coffee—we then march away; 
Go after the Johnnies, we're bound to subdue, 
Make them knock under to the Red, White, and Blue. 
Come, fall in, etc. 
I've been in the army for over three years, 
And fought for the Union with brave Volunteers ; 
I've seen some hard fighting, and dangers went through; 
Three cheer3 for the Union, the Red, White, and Blue.

THE GALLANT NINETY-NINE, 
AIR.—" Irish Molly, Oh 
Ly CAPT. P. "CELLI% 
BRAVE comrades, all, come list to me, your spirits I 
will cheer, 
I 
will try and sing the praise of the gallant Volunteer; 
On picket, or at fighting, boys, with spirits gay and fine. 
I 
do declare, few can compare with Gallant Ninety-Nine. 
At Big Bethel and Newmarket Bridge, we tried the rebel pluck, 
At Hampton Roads, our boys were there, and to their colors 
stuck ; 
Our lads on board the " Congress," with valor there did shine, 
Worked their guns like noble sons of gallant Ninety-Nine. 
Our brave boys were at Hatteras, Roanoke. too, and Newbern, 
To Norfolk next, we there did go, to give them another turn ; 
We landed at Cape Henry, on the beach we formed in line, 
The rebs retire from the fire of the gallant Ninety- Nine. 
At Norfolk then we did encamp, for near six months we lay, 
Then to Deep Creek we started off to drive the rebs away ; 
Through rain and mud we march'd along, o'er trees of fallen 
pine; 
Hurrah! they come, with fife and drum, the gallant Ninety- Nine. 
To Suffolk next we then did go, and left our camping-ground, 
And ordered to the front, brave boys, the rebs did us surround ; 
Three weeks we in the trenches lay, in weather, rain or shine; 
In the rifle pits we gave them fits; hurrah, for Ninety- Nine! 
We lost many gallant comrades on the first of May, 
Sad to relate, our loss was great in that bloody fray ; 
Full sixty killed and wounded, fel: out of the line ; 
Come, drop a 
tear to memory dear, the killed of Ninety-Nine. 
Now o'er the tomb the flowers bloom, of our departed braves, 
And sad to tell, brave Hart* he fell, and fills a 
soldier's grave ; 
On the Blackwater ford his men deployed, as skirmishers in 
line, 
A 
rebel sent a 
ball that went through brave hart of Ninety-
Nine. 
The writer's old captain, J. H. Hart, Esq., killed June 16, 1863. 
WHERE THE GRASS GROWS GREEN. 
I'm Denny Blake from County Clam, 
And here, at your command, 
To sing a 
song in praise of home, 
And my own native land! 
I've sailed to foreign couuteries, 
And in many climes I've been, 
But my heart is still with Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my native country, 
And tho' richer land's I've seerk, 
Yet I 
can't forget Ould Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
Poor Pat is often painted 
With a 
ragged coat and hat; 
His heart and hospitality, 
Has much to do with that. 
Let slanderers say what they will, 
They cannot call him mean; 
Sure, a 
stranger's always welcome 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &O. 
He's foolish, but not vicious, 
His faults I 
won't defend; 
His purse to help the orphan, 
His life to serve a 
friend, 
,ive, without a 
murmur— 
So, his follies try and screen; 
For, there's noble hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, dt.

'Tis true he has a 
weakness 
For a 
drop of something pure, 
Lut that's a

That many more endure. 
He's fond of` fun, he's witty, 
Though his wit ' tis not too keen; 
For, there's feeling hearts in Erin, 
Where the grass grows green. 
I 
love my, &e. 
There's not a 
true-born Irishman, 
Wherever he may be, 
But loves the little Emerald 
That sparkles on the sea. 
May the sun of bright prosperity 
Shine peaceful and serene, 
,And bring better days to Erin. 
Where the grass grows green! 
For I 
love my,

THE CUMBERLAND'S CREW. 
Oh shipmates, come, gather, and join in my ditty; 
It's of a 
terrible battle that happened, of late: 
Let each good Union-Tar shed a 
sad tear of pity, 
When he thinks of the once gallant Cumberland's fate. 
The Eighth day of March told a 
terrible story, 
And many a 
brave tar to this world bid Adieu! 
Yet our Flag it was wrapt in a 
mantle of glory, 
By the heroic deeds of the Cumberland's crew. 
On that ill-fated day, about ten in the morning, 
The sky it was clear, and bright shone the Sun: 
The drums of the Cumberland sounded a 
warning 
That told every seaman to stand by his gun. 
An Iron-clad Frigate down on us came bearing, 
And high in the air the Rebel Flag flew ; 
The Pennant of Treason she proudly was waving, 
Determined to conquer the Cumberland's crew. 
Then, up spoke our Captain with stern resolution, 
Saying: my boys, of this monster now don't be dismayed, 
We swore to maintain our beloved Constitution, 
And to die for our Country we are not afraid ! 
'We fight for the Union: our cause it is glorious, 
To the Stars and the Stripes we will stand ever true. 
We'll sink at our quarters, or conquer victorious 
Was answered, with cheers, from the Cumberland's crew. 
Now our gallant ship fired her guns' dreadful thunder, 
Her broad-side, like hail, on the Rebel did pour; 
The people gazed on, struck with terror and wonder: 
The shots struck his sides, and 
glanced harmless o'er; 
But the pride of our Navy could never be daunted, 
Tho' the dead and the wounded her deck they did strew: 
And the Flag of our Union how proudly it flaunted, 
Sustained by the blood of the Cumberland's crew! 
Slowly they sunk beneath Virginia's waters! 
Their voices on earth will ne'er be heard more. 
They'll be wept by Columbia's brave sons and fair daughters! 
May their blood be avenged on Virginia's shore! 
In that battle- stained grave they are silently lying— 
Their souls have for ever to earth bid Adieu I 
But the Star-Spangled Banner above them is flying: 
It was nailed to the mast by the Cumberland's crew! 
They fought us three hours, with stern resolution, 
Till those Rebels found cannon would never avail them; 
For, the Flag of Secession has no power to gall them, 
THE BATTLE-CRY OF FREEDOM! 
Tho' the blood from their scuppers it crimson'd the tide P 
She struck us amidst-ship, our planks she did sever: 
Her sharp Iron-prong pierced our noble ship through: 
And still, as they sunk on that dark rolling river, 
We'll die at our guns! cried the Cumberland's crew. 
Columbia's sweet birth-right of Freedom's communion, 
Thy Flag never floated so proudly before: 
For, the spirits of those that died for the Union, 
Above its broad folds now exultingly soar! 
And when our sailors in battle assemble, 
God bless our dear Banner, the Red, White and Blue! 
Beneath its bright Stars, we'll cause tyrants to tremble, 
Or sink at our guns, like the Cumberland's crew ! 
THE BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM. 
(RALLYING SONG.) 
Yes, we'll rally round the Flag, boys, we'll rally once again, 
Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom; 
We will rally from the hill-side, we'll gather from the plain, 
Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom ! 
CHORUS. 
The Union forever! hurrah ! boys, hurrah! 
Down with the Traitors, up with the Stars ! 
While we rally round tho Flag, boys, rally once again, 
Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom! 
We are springing to the call of our Brothers gone before, 
Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom! 
And we'll fill the vacant ranks with a 
million Feeemen more, 
Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom 1 
The Union for ever! &c. 
'We will welcome to our numbers the boys all true and brave, 
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom ! 
And although he may be poor, he shall never be a 
slave, 
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom! 
The Union for ever ! 6.7c. 
So we're springing to the call from the East and from the West, 
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom ! 
And we'll hurl the rebel crew from the land we love the best, 
Shouting the battle-cry of freedom! 
The Union for ever, &e.

CAPTAIN KELLY'S "BE SURE YOU'RE 
RIGHT, 
THEN GO A-HEAD ." 
The Music can be obtained at DITSON'S Music Store, 711 Broadway. 
THEY say success in life depends, 
By old and young we hear it said, 
With plenty cash and lots of friends, 
You're always right and go a- head. 
CHORUS. 
This maxim always keep in view, 
Fools rush where angels fear to tread; 
Whatever path you may pursue, 
Be sure you're right, then go a- head. 
The bulls and bears will corner gold, 
And water stocks, their shares to spread; 
Then buy up dupes with what they sold, 
Boat all they can, then go a-head. 
This maxim, etc. 
In politics some make their pile, 
And gamble like a 
thorough-bred; 
Bia diamonds wear and sport the style, 
Fast horses drive, and go a-head. 
This maxim, etc. 
The poor man sweats at honest toil, 
And labors hard to earn his bread, 
Works at the forge and tills the soil, 
From morn till eve to go ahead. 
This maxim, etc. 
When a 
poor fellow's broken down, 
His pockets dry and nary red, 
At his misfortunes never frown, 
Give him a 
lift, and go ahead. 
This maxim, etc. 
The game of life will soon be o'er, 
Old Death is trumf)s, and spades are led, 
The deal is up! we play no more! 
Pass in your checks, and go a-head. 
This maxim, etc.

CAPT. 
KELLY'S MEDLEY. 
HLRK! I 
hear an angel sing, 
In the cottage by the sea; 
Give me back my wedding- ring, 
Sally is the girl for me. 
Put me in my little bed, 
Where the foaming billows roll; 
I 
have not got nary red; 
Johnny, come fill up the bowl. 
Let me like a 
soldier fall, 
When the bloom is on the rye; 
Waiter, bring me one fish-ball, 
How is that, old boy, for high 
Susey stole my heart from me, 
And she put it up the spout ; 
Johnny's on another spree, 
That old thing is about played out. 
Mary had a 
little sheep, 
Great on eating mutton- pies ; 
Mother, I 
came home to sleep, 
Wake me up, when Kirby dies.

ADAM'S ALE. 
A 
glass of cold water I'll drink when I 
am thirsty; 
My lungs it will cool, and my spirits will cheer; 
It makes me feel joyful, so healthy and happy I 
Then, fill up the pitcher, and hand it round here. 
Away with your rum, punch, wine, beer, and cider, 
Your gin, rum, and brandy will send you to jail! 
Come all yo r 
old drunkards, and join the Tea-totallers, 
And you'll have an abundance of Adam's good Ale. 
Contented I 
watch, and contented I 
study; 
Contented I 
pray, and contented I 
sing; 
I 
ne er made a 
practice of drinking not toddy, 
For that is a 
vain and ungodly thing. 
For they that drink of it are poor wretched creatures; 
With hunger their poor little children bewail ! 
Oh! come, drunken parents, provide for your family, 
And join the blest band that drinks Adam's good Ale. 
The drunkard's a 
thief, a 
liar, and swearer, 
A robber, and murderer of his own soul; 
He starves and abuses and beggars his family; 
He makes them go ragged, and filthy, and cold 
A robber of God, a 
seducer of neighbor, 
A 
spoiler of Zion and her happy vale; 
Ye poor, wretched creatures, come, give up your folly, 
And join the blest band that drinks Adam's good Ale. 
The drunkard works hard, and he gives his week's wages 
To furnish the landlord with every fine thing; 
Fine beds and fine carpets, and grand, splendid parlor, 
A watch in his pocket, and jewels and rings, 
A sumptuous living, and excellent clothing; 
His wife dressed in silks, her gold rings, hat and veil; 
Look round you, poor drunkard, examine your conduct, 
And, now, make a 
trial of Adam's good Ale. 
This Ale is so cheering, refreshing, and cleansing! 
It makes the whole world rich, healthy and gay; 
It watered bright Eden, and Adam enjoyed it, 
Before he transgressed or corrupted his way. 
Not one single blessing on this side of Jordan, 
More free, meet, or plenteous for man's happy va.e; 
It's granted in showers, sent down by the Powers 
Of Heaven, the Brewer of Adam's good Ale!

THE LOST PATH. 
By THOMAS D.tvis. 
Alit:—" Gra ma chree." 
Sweet thoughts, bright dream.% my comfort be, 
All comfort else has flown ; 
For every hope was false to me, 
And here I 
am, alone. 
What thoughts were mine in early youth ! 
Like some old Irish song, 
Brimful of love, and life, and truth, 
My spirit gusli'd along. 
I 
hope to right my native isle, 
I 
hope a 
soldier's fame, 
I 
hope to rest in woman's smile, 
And win a 
minstrel's name. 
Oh ! 
little have I 
served my land, 
No laurels press my brow, 
I 
have no woman's heart or hand, 
Nor minstrel honors now. 
But fancy has a 
magic power, 
It brings me wreath and crown, 
And woman's love, the self-same hours 
It smites oppression down. 
Sweet thoughts, bright dreams, my comfort be, 
I 
have no joy beside ; 
Oh! throng around, and be to me, 
Power, country, fame, and bride.

THE GIRL I LEFT BEHIND 
E. 
A PRISON SONG. 
By Dn. R. 
D. 
JOYCE. 
I 
sat beneath a 
withered tree 
1Vhen winter winds blew keenly, 
As soon such winds might bring to me 
The red rose blushing sheenly. 
As fate returns life's jovial morn 
And smiling gay re-find me 
The hopes all cross'd, the loved and lost, 
The girl I 
left behind me. 
Like that sere tree whose leaflets shone 
Last Spring, with dewdrops pearly, 
My hopes ont•bloomed at manhood's dawn 
In love's light shining early, 
The leaves are dead, my joys are fled, 
The tyrant's shackles bind me, 
And never more may fate restore 
The girl I 
left behind inc. 
Ent sure a 
man bath other ties 
Than love's light flame pursuing, 
To dry his country's tearful eyes, 
The tyrant's work undoing. 
I 
sowed the seed of that bright creed, 
And scorn the doom assigned me— 
For her alone, I 
make toy moan, 
The girl I 
left behind me. 
They tell me that her early bloom 
Is dimmed Nvith constant weeping, 
Like Ireland o'er her woeful doom 
A tearful vigil keeping_ 
But spite of fears and patriot tears, 
My better hopes remind me, 
I'll see her face, and yet embrace 
The girl I 
1 
ft behind the. 
Yes, sometimes to my prison cell 
Hope collies in arms all gleaming, 
In fancy brings the battle yell 
And green flturs proudly streaming. 
In fancy shows our tyrant foes 
Retreat, no more to bind me, 
And Freedom's reign restores again, 
The girl I 
left behind me.

DEAR LAND. 
When comes the day, all hearts to weigh, 
if stanch they be, or vile, 
Shall we forget the sacred debt 
We owe our mother isle ? 
My native heath is brown beneath, 
My native waters blue ; 
But crimson red o'er both shall spread, 
Ere I 
am false to you, 
Dear land— 
Ere I 
am false to you. 
When I 
behold your mountains bold— 
Your noble lake and streams— 
A mingled tide of grief and pride, 
tVithin my bosom teems. 
I 
think of all your long, dark thrall— 
Your martyrs brave and true; 
And clash apart the tears that start— 
We must not wcip for you, 
Dear land— 
We must not weep for you. 
My grandsire died, his home beside; 
They seized and hanged him there: 
His only crime, in evil time, 
Your hallowed green to wear. 
Across the main his brothers twain

DEAR LAND.—NONCLUDED. 
Were sent to pine and rue; 
And still they turn'd, with hearts that burn'd 
In hopeless love to you, 
Dear laud— 
I
II hopeless love to you. 
My boyish ear still clung to hear 
Of Erin's pride of yore, 
Ere Norman loot had dared pollute 
Her inllepe ,:dent-shore ; 
Of chiefs, long dead, ‘vho rose to head 
Some gallant patriot few, 
Till all my aim on earth became 
To strike one blow for you, 
Dear land— 
To strike one blow for you. 
What path is best your rights tc wrest 
Let other heads divine ; 
By work or word, with voice or sword, 
'L.• follow them be mine. 
The breast that zeal and hatred steel, 
No terrors can subdue ; 
If death should come, that martyrdom 
Were sweet, endured for you, 
Dear land--
Were sweet, endured for you.

THE DEA11 LITTLE SHAMROCK.—[CoscLuntu.] 
That dear little plant still grows in our land, 
Fresh and fair as the daughters of Erin; 
Whose smiles can bewitch and whose eyes can command 
In each climate they ever appear in. 
For they shine thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland„ 
Just like their own dear little Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland. 
That dear little plant that springs from our soil, 
When its three little leaves are extended, 
Denotes from the stalk we together should toil, 
And ourselves by ourselves be befriended. 
And still thro' the bog, thro' the brake, and the mireland, 
From one root should branch like the Shamrock of Ireland: 
The dear little Shamrock, the sweet little Shamrock, 
The dear little, sweet little Shamrock of Ireland.

Ochl North dear I 
I'm waiting here, 
I'm watching still for you, love: 
And while you sleep, the flow'rets weep, 
All shrined in tears of dew, love. 
The silvery moon its bright rays soon 
Behind the hills will fade, love 
But better there her beauties bear: 
For thou her beams would shade, love. 
Och ! Norah dear! 
()eh! Norah dear ! I'm waiting here, 
The stars look cold and blue, love: 
Their twinkling rays have come to gaze, 
To see how bright are you, love : 
The breeze that brings such balmy things 
From all that's bright and fair, love; 
It sighs to sip from thy sweet lip 
The perfume that lies there, love.

A ROVER I WILL BE. 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
I LOVED a 
girl named Mary Jane, 
A 
bonny lass was she; 
I 
tried my best her heart to gain, 
And win her love to me; 
Her ruby lips so bright and red 
Are longing for a 
kiss, 
With eyes that sparkle in her head, 
So full of love and bliss. 
CHORUS. 
For Mary Jane I'll cross the main, 
And plough the raging sea; 
The briny foam shall be my home— 
A 
rover I 
will be. 
But Mary proved to me unkind— 
My heart with grief is torn ; 
No peace or comfort can I 
find, 
I'm wretched and forlorn ; 
They say true love can ne'er forget; 
I 
found it so with me, 
For Mary shook me, and you bet 
A 
rover I 
will be. 
For Mary Jane, etc. 
MY LITTLE DAISY. 
To MY 
KATIE. 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
My bonny girl is like a 
fairy, 
Dear to me, so blithe and gay; 
Her form is fair, step light and airy ; 
Sweeter than the rose in May. 
As dark as raven's wing her tresses, 
Bright as sunlight is her eye ; 
With loving glance to cheer and bless us, 
Beaming like a 
summer's sky. 
Her gentle heart is warm and tender, 
Pure in thourdit and free from guile, 
And mine a 
thrill of joy cloth render, 
As I 
greet her winning smile. 
In Katie lies my hope and treasure, 
For joy and bliss her smiles impart; 
My Daisy is my pride and pleasure, 
As I 
hold her to my heart. 
The Music of this song can be obtained at Drrsox's Music Store, No. 711 
Broadway. 
THIS loving heart of mine 
Will share each thought with thine 
False it will never be; 
Thy winning smile and grace, 
Kind heart and loving face, 
Are light and life to me. 
This loving heart of mine 
Thy image will enshrine ; 
My thoughts are all on thee; 
For each fond vow and kiss, 
We gave to seal our bliss, 
Will bring bright hopes to me. 
This loving heart of mine 
No longer will repine; 
Love whispers in mine ear; 
Should every friend depart, 
Bright joy will fill my heart, 
My cherished bride is near. 
THE DEAR IRISH BOY.

THE DEAR IRISH BOY.—[CoNcLunED./ 
No roebuck more swifter can flee o'er the mountain, 
No Briton bolder 'midst danger or scar; 
He's slightly, he's lightly, he's as clear as the fountain, 
His eyes twinkling love, and he's gone to the war. 
Oho.—Smiling, beguiling, &c. 
The soft-tuning lark, its notes shall cease mourning, 
The dull screaming owl shall cease its night's sleep, 
While seeking lone walks in the shades of the evening, 
If my Connor return not, I'll never cease to weep. 
Cho.—Smiling, beguiling, &c. 
The war is all over, and my love is not returning, 
I 
fear that some envious plot has been laid, 
Or some cruel goddess has him captivated, 
And left me to mourn here, a 
dear Irish maid.

YOU'LL SOON FORGET KATHLEEN. 
Sung by MISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
[The circumstance, which gave rise to this beautiful ballad, occurred 
during the visit of a 
friend of the author to the north of Ireland, and 
was most feelingly related to the author by him. 
It was the parting of a 
young tenant-farmer from his betrothed, on going to seek his fortune 
in some distant land.] 
Oh! leave not your Kathleen, there's no one can cheer her, 
Alone in the wide world, unpitied she'll sigh: 
And scenes that were loveliest, when thou wert but near her, 
Recall the sad visions of days long gone by! 
'Tis vain that you tell me: you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'er return more: 
Far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me— 
You'll soon forget Kathleen, and Erin Go Bragh 1 
Oh! leave not the land, the sweet land of your childhood, 
Where joyously passed the first days of our youth, 
Where gaily we wandered 'mid valley and wildwood: 
Oh! those were the bright days of innocent truth! 
'Tis vain that you tell me you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'er return more 
Far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me— 
You'll soon forget Kathleen, and Erin Go Bragh I

Ant:—" The Wearing of the Green." 
Oh ! friends and neighbors, did you read of that foul miff:

On English ground ?--no blacker deed e'er witnessed 
Mary's son. 
The victim was an Irish child, of gentle heart and mien, 
Whose parents long had been exiled throm:gh loving ot

Through loving of the " Green," 
Through loving of the " Green," 
Like thousands more, they lett our shore 
Through loving of the " Green."

Four Irish children, free from care, played ' neath the sum.

Their hearts were light, their eyes were bright, their 
cheeks like hismore's sheen ; 
And o'er their necks of glancing white, hung ribbons of 
" 
the Green." 
Hung ribbons of " the Green," 
Our country's native 
Green," 
For you " mo stor" your children wore 
Their darling " Irish Green." 
At sight of Erin's color, rose the Saxon's savage brood, 
And soon beneath their cruel blows, lier blood the stones 
imbued ; 
Her sister led herhome to die--hem mother's breast between, 
But God's good angels bore on high this " Martyr of the 
Green," 
This " Martyr for the Groom)." 
This " Martyr for the Green," 
His curse upon the land where died

Oh ! Irish parents, think upon time mother's wailing wild, 
And on the father's stilled sobs above his mordemed child; 
Was not their child as dear to them as hers to England's 
Queen?

THE MURDER OF AILEEN HIGGINS. 
[CONCLUDED 
Yet she has let the murderers clear—through hatred of

Through hatred of the " Green "— 
She never loved the " Green."

But all will pray " God speed the day for raising of the 
'Green.' " 
For raising of the " Green," 
For raising of the 
Green," 
Our Martyrs pray—" God speed the day 
For raising of the' Green.'" 
And you brave hearts of Clanna Gael, who from the 
Western strand 
Gaze wistfully towards Innisfai I, your OWD beloved land ; 
Who trust that soon on Erin's hills your banners will be 
seen, 
When you'll avenge her thousand ills like soldiers of the 
" 
Green," 
Like soldiers of the " Green." 
True soldiers of time " Green," 
Oh I 
good St. Bride, speed o'er the tide 
The soldiers of the " Green. ' 
When o'er your ranks the " Green's" displayed oh I 
never 
boys, forget 
The fate of that young Irish maid— the pattern theft she set. 
She fell (may bards her prakes sing), the high-souled 
young eailin. 
Because she'd to her colors cling—she'd Nut' " take down 
the " Green.' 
She'd not take down the " Green.'' 
She'd neer take do‘vn m 
he ‘' Green.' 
SHE'D NEVER STRIKE HER COUNTRY'S FLAG, 
She died to save the " Green." 
By R. D. W ILLIAms 
From a 
Munster vale they brought her, 
Prom the pure and balmy air, 
An Ormond peasant's daughter, 
With blue eyes and golden hair. 
They brought her to the city, 
And she faded slowly there, 
Consumption has no pity 
For blue eyes and golden hair. 
When I 
saw her first reclining, 
Her lips were moved in pray'r ; 
And the setting sun was shilling 
On her loosen'd golden hair. 
When our kindly glances met her, 
Deadly brilliant was her eye : 
And she said that she was better, 
While we knew that site must die. 
She speaks of Munster valleys, 
The patron, dance, and fair, 
And her thin hand feebly dallies 
With her scattered golden hair. 
When silently we listen'd 
To her breath with quiet care, 
Her eyes with wonder glisten'd— 
And she asked us what was there. 
The poor thing smiled to ask it, 
And her pretty mouth laid bare, 
Like gems within a 
casket, 
A string of pearlets rare. 
We said that we were trying 
By the gushing of her blood. 
And the time she took in sighing 
To know if she were good. 
Well, she smil'd and chatted gayly, 
Tho' we saw in mute despair 
The hectic brighter daily, 
And the death-dew on her hair. 
And oft her wasted fingers 
Beating time upon the bed, 
O'er some old tune she lingers, 
And she bows her golden head. 
At length the harp is broken, 
And the spirit in its strings, 
As the last decree is broken 
To its source exulting springs. 
Descending swiftly from the skies, 
Her guardian angel came, 
He struck God's lightning front her eyes, 
And bore him back the flame. 
Before the sun had risen 
Tim; the lark-loved morning air, 
her young soul left its prison, 
Undefiled by sin or care. 
I 
stood beside the couch in tears 
Where pale and calm she slept, 
And tho' I've gaz'd on death for years, 
I 
blush not that I 
wept. 
I 
check'd with effort pity's sighs 
And left the matron there. 
To close the curtains of her eyes, 
And bind her golden hair. 
[" The Dying Girl" was an inmate of one of the hos-
pitals in Dublin attended by Mr. Williams.] 
THE OLD CAUSE. 
By T. D. SewvAN 
Here's to the old green land once more! 
Here's to the dear old cause again ! 
Good men have pledged the toast beforo 
In deeper floods of redder rain. 
Their fight is fought, their duty done, 
But fill the flashing wine- cup high 
We'll bear the grand old banner on 
Some distance yet before we die! 
Hurrah I 
hurrah ! 
Perhaps it may 
Be our best fortune to behold 
That banner bright 
in Freedom's light, 
Display its Harp of Gold. 
Ha! listen friends and comrades brave, 
They thought our nation's soul had flown; 
They lai ,i 
her in a 
narrow grave, 
Beneath another heavy stone. 
In vain; we've seen her on the height, 
We've met her in the valley green, 
She whispers to our hearts to- night, 
With harp tunes gushing oft between. 
Hurrah ! hurrah 
She wakes the lay, 
That nerved the arm of Brian bold, 
'That fanned to fire 
Fitzgerald's ire 
Upon her Harp of Gold. 
Aye, let the same old strain arise. 
The land they loved to us remains; 
We have the same soft, cloudy skies, 
The purple hills, the verdant plains. 
We have a 
dearer cause than theirs, 
For time has brought us down since then. 
The added wrongs of many years— 
The flowing blood of other men. 
Hurrah ! hurrah ! 
God speed the day 
So long expected and foretold, 
When tones that tell 
Ot joy shall swell 
From out that Harp of Gold. 
Our mountain brooks were rushing. 
Annie, dear ; 
The autumn eve was flushing% 
Annie, dear; 
But brighter was your blushing, 
When first, your murmurs hushing, 
I 
told my love outgushing, 
Annie, dear; 
Alt 
but our hopes were splendid, 
Annie, dear; 
How sadly they have ended, 
Annie, dear; 
The ring betwixt us broken, 
When our VOWs of love were spoken, 
Of your poor heart was a 
token, 
Annie, dear ; 
The primrose flow'rs were shining, 
Annie, dear; 
When on my breast reclining, 
Annie, dear; 
Began our Mi-na-Meala, 
And many a 
month did follow 
Of joy—but life is hollow, 
Annie, dear ; 
For once.. when home returning, 
Annie, dear; 
found our cottage burning, 
Annie, dear ; 
Around it vere the yoemen. 
Of every ill and omen. 
The country's bitter foemen. 
Annie, dear; 
But why arose a 
morrow, 
Annie, dear; 
Upon that night of sorrow, 
Annie, dear; 
Far better, by thee 
Their bayonets defying, 
Than live in exile sighing, 
Annie, dear.

THE LITTLE COLLEEBT.—FONcLuDED.] 
My father had gone to his work on the farm, 
My mother was minding the dairy, 
To go to the fair I 
thought it no harm, 
So tripped it as light as a 
fairy ; 
The lads and the lasses were (lancing with glee, 
Miss Macarty was out with big Harry; 
I 
looked all around, but no where could I 
see 
My swateheart, my own darling Larry. 
Cho.— Then success, &c. 
Then the piper struck up wid a 
beautiful tune, 
Och, the music he play'd was delightful; 
If Larry don't come I'll go mad very soon, 
For indade I 
was getting quite spiteful; 
They kissed in the ring, the buckle they crost, 
My feet I 
could scarcely keep quiet, 
I 
wanted a 
jig, but my partner I'd lost, 
When I 
get him I'll kick up a 
riot. 
Cho.— Then success, ikc. 
Mister Larry in the midst of the fair I 
did spy, 
He was dancing a 
lilt so delicious 
With Mistress Kate Kearney; to myself then thinks 
This conduct is rather suspicious ; 
To trate me so lightly, you'll say 'twas a 
shame, 
When admirers I 
know I 
have plenty, 
To put up with such conduct I'd be much to blame, 
Where he's one swateheart, I 
can get twinty. 
Cho.— Then success, dz-
c. 
If a 
nate Irish boy in the company here 
Will propose then, no longer I'll tarry; 
If he's English I 
don't mind, bekase I've a 
fear 
I'm getting too ould now to marry; 
If he's Scotch I 
don't mind, for I 
now feel inclined 
For his conduct to make Larry whistle ; 
If we wed, our affections they shall be entwined 
Like the Shamrock, the Rose, and the Thistle. 
Cho.—Then success, cte.

A HYMN. 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
SWEET Jesus on the Cross we See, 
In bloody sweat and agony; 
A crown of thorns upon his head, 
By sinful man his blood was shed. 
His sacred flesh is rent and torn, 
Then spit upon with hate and scorn; 
Between two thieves the Holy Lamb 
Poured out his blood for sinful man. 
The sun refused to give its light, - 
Ashamed to view the dismal sight; 
The moon and stars in darkness lay, 
The earth in terror shook that day. 
Oh! precious Lamb, for sinners slain, 
Come, cleanse my soul from every stain, 
Thou robed in sublime majesty, 
In pity, Lord, look down on me. 
A HYMN. 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
GOD IS with us 
All OUT 1110112.1US 
From temptation 
Watches us with 
diere'er we be, 
and actions see; 
s 
every snare, 
tender care 
If the world upon you frown, 
And by sin and woe cast clown ; 
When affliction sore you feel, 
Come to Jesus' feet and kneel, 
Seek forgiveness for the past, 
From the sins that bind you fast 
To the Lamb for sinners slain 
No one ever came in vain. 
When we leave this world below, 
Thy kind mercy to us show ; 
Chief of sinners tho' we be, 
Lord, we put our trust in t 
hoe. 
IN MEMORIAM.

AIR.—" 
The Wearing of the Green." 
By CAPT. P. 
KELLY. 
OUR cruel war is over now, the strife is at an end, 
No more, in hostile ranks array'd, the North and South con-
tend ; 
We are a 
band of brothers now, in peace and unity. 
And everything is settled up just as it ought to be. 
There's noble Grant and Sherman, too, they never yet did yield ; 
Phil Sheridan and Thomas are both masters in the field ; 
Brave Farragut and Porter long have ruled upon the sea, 
And made our enemies submit, whoever they may be. 
Now, God bless our gallant soldiers, and sailor lads so true— 
Defenders of our Country's Flag, we all depend on you ; 
If any foreign foe dare come to land upon our shore, 
We'll send them back a- flying, as we often did before. 
Fill to the memory, comrades, of all who fought and fell 
For Union, Right, and Liberty, the flag we love so well ; 
Their graves are scattered far and wide, on bill and dale they 
rest, 
A 
Nation chants their requiem, the bravest and the best. 
A 
HYMN. 
By CAPT. P 
KELLY. 
OUR Father who in heaven art, 
Oh, Lord ! we pray thy grace impart, 
To us poor sinners here below, 
Thy love and mercy to us show. 
Give us this day our daily bread, 
Thy countless blessings on us shed ; 
From all temptations guide our path, 
And save us from Thy holy wrath. 
Our sins forgive, Oh, Lord ! we pray, 
Keep us from harm— he Thou our stay; 
Give us Thy grace and love divine— 
Through life, Oh, Lord ! all praise be thine. 
And when at last on that great day, 
When earth and sky shall pass away, 
We hope to find eternal rest 
On Thy right hand, among the bless'd.

By CAPT. P .

A 
LONG and happy life is past, 
Gone to his bright reward at last, ; 
He paid the debt all ot us owe, 
And soon or late we have to go. 
He bore his sufferings like a 
saint, 
Without a 
murmur or complaint; 
His heart was pure and free from guile; 
his heavenly face beam'd with a 
smile. 
His heart and hand was ever free 
In deeds of love and charity; 
He passed his three score years and ten 
One of the best and kindest men. 
God's holy law his hope and guide, 
A 
Christian Marron lived and died; 
A loving wife he left behind, 
And children dear, so good and kind. 
Their every wish and constant care, 
That God their father's life might spare; 
But God bath willed it otherwise, 
And called him borne to paradise. 
His righteous soul bath wing'd its flight 
To heaven, we trust, with angels bright; 
Crown him, Oh, Lord, in heaven above, 
With glory and eternal love.

THE PARTING SIGH. 
By Cr. P. 
K ELLY. 
DIIISIC by AXGUSTErS CULL. 
WHEN parting from our friends so dear, 
We feel a 
pang we dare not speak, 
The heaving sigh, the scalding tear, 
Is coursing down our pallid cheek, 
We miss the old, the young, and fair, 
The winning smile and loving heart ; 
When sorrow comes each has his share— 
The nearest, dearest friends must part. 
CHORTJS. 
The fond good-bye and heartfelt sigh 
Will cause the tears to start, 
And sorrow grim the eye will dim, 
And rend the loving heart. 
With joy we hail the glad return, 
And seek each friendly hand to greet, 
With anxious hearts we wait to learn 
From absent friends, and those we meet, 
The fond embrace and loving kiss, 
The welcome smile and friendly cheer, 
All speak of joy and heavenly bliss, 
From thae we love and cherish dear. 
The fond good-bye, etc. 
Death tears a 
dear one from our sight, 
Dark gloom and woe our bosoms fill; 
This lonely heart has felt the blight, 
And sorrow lingers round it still; 
When hungry death my lips shall seal, 
And close my eyes from all that's dear, 
The silent grave my faults conceal, 
Then brighten memory with a 
tear. 
The fond good-bye, etc.
