Anita Endrezze:  This is a poem called “Thirteen Ways of Looking at an Indian” by Anita 
Endrezze. 
 
[Anita Endrezze reads “Thirteen Ways of Looking at an Indian”] 
 
AE:  “Thirteen Ways of Looking at an Indian”—commentary by Anita Endrezze. 
 
Poet Wallace Stevens wrote “Thirteen ways of looking at a blackbird.” I’ve generally followed 
his intent in each section or stanza, sometimes by using a word or two that he’s used and other 
times by following his ideas or structure.  
 
Coyote stories are part of Native cultures in North America. Coyote is a Trickster and appears in 
many of my stanzas. Coyote is a survivor like Native people. He is a resistor even though he’s 
still hunted, his skin hanging on barbed wire fences. There’s a bounty on his pelt the way white 
men took Indian scalps for five dollars during the California Gold Rush era. Or sold Yaquis for 
twenty-five cents each in Mexico to slave on the Yucatán henequen plantations. 
 
In many ways we’ve reinvented the image of “Native” through powwows, music, literature, and 
art. We’re even decolonizing our diets by using more indigenous foods.  
 
Some of us are urban Indians; others live on reservations. Our lives are varied with many 
different experiences. We call ourselves by tribal or national name. Or by pop culture ones like 
ndn. We’re Indian, Native American, American Indian. We’re a mixture of brown, black, white, 
red—a rainbow of people. But no matter the names or self-identification, we survive. In the last 
stanza, Coyote sits next to the persona, promising tomorrow. And more tomorrows. Circles 
within circles. 
 
The poem ends by saying we can’t be defined by labels. Our souls, no matter how we self-
identify, have no boundaries.  
 
The great spiritual leader Black Elk said that we are all one people. Some of you might think: 
No, there are Asians and Blacks and Whites and Native Americans. But think of it this way: 
There is the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, the 
Mediterranean, etc.—but they’re all part of one sea. They are the same sea.  
 
In that way, no matter how many ways you look at or judge or classify individuals, we are all 
one people. We are unique and part of the starry universe.  
 
Recorded Monday, June 29, in the poet’s home near Seattle, Washington. My native affiliation 
is Yaqui.
