April 17, 2014, Mark Wagler talking with Ken Swift in Madison, Wisconsin. Born 
in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, 1952. His background is Caucasian, mostly English. B.S. from 
University of Wisconsin in 1975 in Elementary Education, major in Social Studies, along with a 
Wisconsin license to teach grades K-8. In 2000, got a Masters in Environmental and 
Experiential Education from Bradford University. Always taught in Madison. In 1976-77 he had 
a temporary contract at Van Hise Elementary. Because teachers were being laid off during that 
time due to declining enrollment, he taught only one year, then substitute-taught for three 
years in the district.  
Then he and his wife left the country for several years; when he returned there was still no 
hiring in the school district but he got a job at Wingra School teaching kindergarten and 1st 
grade, for four years, ending in 1987 when the district started hiring again and he got a job 
that fall. Ken had started his class at Wingra, so it was tough leaving a class he had bonded 
with for a week, but he had to make the jump because of his belief in public education. 
Wingra was a tuition-based open classroom private school, a great school.  Ken found himself 
as a teacher there; realized he could be his wacky self. He hadn't really had the grounding to 
be a teacher as a male--not that it is different, but he had to learn to be himself. 
00:04:10  
From 1987-2011, Ken taught in two schools: Marquette Elementary, where he 
started in 4th and 5th grade, and then went back to 1st grade because he had felt he had 
never learned to teach reading and he needed to do that. He realized that 1st grade was his 
age of delight and most interest. So he stayed at 1st and 2nd grade for the rest of his career. In 
1991, Lapham School re-opened as a sister school to Marquette, so Marquette became 3rd 
through 5th grade, and Lapham was pre-k through 2nd grade. So Ken taught in Lapham from 
1991 to 2011. Since 2011, he has gone back to subbing throughout the district, but only 
primary. [sound of microphone being handled]  
Ken decided to become a teacher as an undergrad; it was a pragmatic decision because he had 
to declare a major and he wanted to leave college with a transportable skill. He had an 
interest in children, liked their energy and excitement. Had some exposure to camps and such 
things as a young adult that he had some exposure to children. As a junior, he participated in 
the College Year in India program; he had to figure out a fieldwork project for that year and he 
got the idea to do children's street and playground games, based on the Opies who collected 
children's games in Great Britain. So Ken had exposure to kids on the street in India, has lots of 
stories about that, and in schools as well. That re-affirmed his interest in kids. It was harrowing 
at times because they made fun of him; he became the joke, and also re-affirmed it was the 
direction he wanted to continue.

A typical day: first thing is that you have to be prepared for the day, so Ken 
would always get there early and made sure he had materials ready. He would look at email 
quickly for messages from parents, then go out and greet the kids on the playground, where 
they would be for recess. He'd check in with everyone quickly to see if there was upset; 
especially with young kids you tune into that right away.  Quickly, as you line them up and lead 
them in and get them to the lockers, you get a sense of their spirit. Some kids you always need 
to check in with because their emotional barometers are all over the place throughout the 
day. Certain kids you need to support more. Kids come into the classroom, do the routines, 
put things away, and then they would sit together at tables and do some reading or something 
until they all got together for a group. In the group, lunch count and attendance would take 
place, and toward the end Ken would enter that information into the computer and send it to 
the office; earlier in his career, he'd deliver that information with a phone call or a note. Often 
they would sing a song or two in group; there was a range of things they would do, depending 
on the plans for the day. Then, they'd preview the day [background sounds of pages turning], 
ken would write the schedule on the board and go over unusual things. Kids would share, they 
might do a three-questions activity. Then depending on the specials, they would move into 
Language Arts, reading, followed by their writing.  
All these things were routine expectations for what to do; the kids knew what to do and 
where to be. In Ken's class they always had what were called "special spots" where kids could 
go to work alone. For reading, he would meet with a group in a certain spot, and the kids in 
those special spots would go somewhere else. There was small group work throughout the 
day with math, social studies and science. With writing, it was more individual. He often had 
student teachers, so there was often a second adult in the room, if not a third and fourth 
because he would encourage parental involvement, so he could plug them in at any point in 
the day to support kids in learning. Reading groups were different. This was 1st and 2nd grade, 
so you had some kids learning letter sounds and other kids reading at the 8th grade level, a 
whole range. It was exciting and challenging to teach these young kids, all the time.  
00:14:20  
There were always changes throughout the year. There would be big projects 
that would blow up the schedule. After a while, he wouldn't write the schedule on the board 
anymore, because he would totally diverge from the intended schedule. He would allow 
tangents to happen. He would put general topics on the board, but not times. Certain kids 
would get upset with deviation, so Ken made that a non-issue. Third quarter would be 
devoted to Great Blue, with the kids doing inquiry projects, where they got to choose a topic 
they were passionately interested. During third quarter, that would be most of each day, and 
kids would go to their special spots to work, unless they were collaborating in a team effort, 
usually pairs. Sometimes they would do larger group projects, but it was mostly individuals 
and pairs. The projects might be science, social studies, anything in any realm, which was the 
excitement.  
00:17:45  
Ken loved working with the kids and building relationships. There were so many 
personalities he appreciated. He loved exposing them to new ideas and new cultures, because

he had those experiences as a child when his parents lived in Tanzania, and then on his own, 
with his brother's nudge, traveling on his own. He wanted to experience the world on his own 
without his parents, and the junior year in India provided that. Ken wanted to share those rich 
cultural experiences with his students. Especially India, because it is so full of color and 
excitement; it was often the favorite thing of kids during the year, and for Ken, too.  
What would Ken have wanted to change: he would have liked more openness in curriculum, 
although he can't say that he'd have a better plan for teaching kids skills than the experts' 
plans. But he would have loved doing Great Blue more than he was able to. He found that for 
the kids who struggle to learn to read--15 to 20%--there was one program that really worked. 
He would have liked to have been in a school with teachers who taught more the way Ken did; 
that comfort came from the Heron Network where people taught the same ways, but they 
were all scattered around; it would have been fantastic to be in a school where the Heron 
Network teachers were all together. 
00: 
22:40 Ken has the biggest impact on how he teaches; he realized that at Wingra 
School, that he was the one who could create the classroom, not anyone else. But at the same 
time, he was also impacted by collaborating with other colleagues across the district and 
sometimes in his school. The last librarian at Lapham was a great resource for bouncing ideas 
around. Only several teachers there over the years were people who he could talk about 
curriculum with. Ken's deepest wish for his students was that they would love learning, gain 
confidence, gain skills.   
Throughout the year, Ken has done typical things like the "student of the week" which he 
called "author of the week" where they would write a story and bring their family into the 
class. He would often have a time when the whole class would bring food from their family 
cultures, a big evening. Ken would bring the outside world in from the student's end. And from 
Ken's time living in Tanzania and India, he could bring those cultures into the classroom. He 
took them on fieldtrips in the local community, and they went camping overnight at the end of 
the year. They would go clean up Tenney Park in the neighborhood, and they had an outdoor 
garden at the school Ken would take the kids too.  They would visit their sister classroom at 
Marquette school, and at the end of the year they would join to pick up trash and pull out 
non-native plants in the parks near the schools. 
00:27:15  
What real-world challenges, tools, skills did Ken provide for his students? By 
going out into the community and doing things, in the garden and in the parks, the kids got an 
awareness of their community, and how to do things to better it. Throughout the year, Ken 
would expose the kids to struggles of people—African American comes to mind—and they had 
songs they would sing, one about Rosa Parks and one about Harriet Tubman, that would 
inform them about historical issues that are still alive today. He would have parents come in 
as guests, who had been involved or could share about various struggles of people.  
Getting kids involved really depended on the year, and local issues in the community, city or 
whatever. Great Blue often offered topics that the kids’ own research would bring up. There

was to be a Ku Klux Klan march here one year, and that became the topic of a Great Blue 
article. Topics for Great Blue often came about from what was in the air, what was happening. 
Ken didn’t necessarily set out to build identities in the kids, such as bird watcher or scientist or 
activist, but everyone would know if one student was passionate about a certain topic. For 
some kids, an interest could be all-consuming; everyone had particular interests that they 
would want to write about, but Ken didn’t exactly define it and label it as such. 
 
00:32:15 
Ken has mentioned how there were not enough colleagues at his school who 
were interested in the type of learning Ken was. He was definitely out of the box. The most 
exciting part of the year was collaborating with the Heron Network teachers around the Great 
Blue projects, and later toward the end, they would have major outings with all the kids at the 
Arboretum, doing conferences and sharing ideas and celebrating. Then, they’d do a project at 
the Arboretum to support the Arboretum. [phone rings] The Heron Network found that email 
was key to their communication; they did meet face to face to make plans, but it was a 
challenge. People would realize it was time to start working on the projects and then 
communicate via email; toward the end, it was Ken driving the calendar, reminding people to 
get together and figure out tasks; the conferences took a lot of organization. You had to round 
up presenters—artists, scientists, writers—people from all interests and occupations came to 
present, to inspire the kids to find a project they were interested in pursuing. The Heron 
Network teachers put in a lot of extra time, way beyond the average school day, because of 
their great love for inquiry. It was the most exciting curricular time of year for the class, 
although the India material was also very exciting. 
 
00:37:00  
At Ken’s school, staff meetings were never helpful for what he did. They came 
from top down, and presented issues the teachers had to be exposed to; they did get the 
whole staff together which was good.  He didn’t resent the meetings, but didn’t learn a whole 
lot about them. Ken didn’t regularly eat lunch in the teacher’s lounge, although he would 
force himself to do that once a week. He would usually eat in his room with his student 
teacher, and maybe another colleague they collaborated with. [sound from microphone being 
handled] Ken would always attend the big parties, such as the ones around holidays or end of 
the school year, and he would enjoy those. The Friday afternoons going to a local watering 
hole he attended rarely, but when he did he enjoyed them. He had so much work to do on 
Fridays to prepare for the next week that he rarely felt he could leave at 3:30 to go to an 
event.  
 
While technically he knew the teachers and staff at his school were part of his occupational 
group, in his heart and soul he knew most of them were really not his style. He wishes he 
could have had a school of like-minded teachers. The most communal thing they shared that 
wasn’t imposed on them was the union. When there were bargaining issues, they would 
picket together before school. At the end of Ken’s career, with Act 10 and Governor Walker, 
the union was hugely communal. It brought them together as a staff as much as anything. 
There was a recognition over the years of Ken’s school being a wonderful place to teach; there 
were not big camps of teachers; in some schools, teachers split into big cliques, but that didn’t 
happen at Lapham.

00:43:00  
Staff knew that Ken taught the way he did. They didn’t resent it, but certainly 
didn’t want to join in. Toward the end, for things like going camping, he had to do it with 
others, he couldn’t be the only one or it would stick out. He offered the opportunity to his 
grade level, but people weren’t really up for it. Sometimes people did collaborate, and those 
trips were not as fun because there were masses of kids and parents involved; it didn’t feel as 
wonderful as it did for the tight little classroom. But because Ken did what he did, families 
wanted to be in his classroom. He heard from various people their regret when they couldn’t 
have their kids in his classroom.  
 
They used to do looping, where they’d keep their kids for two years in a row, 1st and 2nd 
grade, and then start again at 1st, but it became very political because only two teachers did 
this; the other teachers didn’t want to. Ken didn’t understand why you wouldn’t want to keep 
your kids for two years. The principal found it so political, she dropped it. 
 
00:46:10  
The stories shared with colleagues in the school were usually about things that 
happened in the classroom, sometimes challenges, sometimes hilarious things, sometimes 
things Ken was trying out curricularly. They especially shared stories about kids or things that 
parents brought in. With the Heron Network, those stories would come out especially when 
they were editing the stories for publication in Great Blue; they would read each other clips 
from the projects which was fun, but often they had to stick to the task and stay focused so 
they didn’t get to share as many stories. But they enjoyed sharing each other’s company and 
looked forward to meeting, and all wished it would happen more. In the community, you had 
to be careful about the stories you told, but at home he shared similar stories—funny things 
that happened in the classroom, challenges. What Ken remembers about teaching is the 
excitement connected to certain times of year: Great Blue, going camping, talking about India.  
 
The kids would take home stories about Hindu gods and goddesses, and parents would get 
back to Ken in a positive way about how they never expected their kids to learn about Shiva 
and Ganesh. The families would get excited by the kids’ interest. That was what Ken loved 
about teaching—the exposure he was able to give kids to things and places they never would 
have had for that otherwise. He thinks he is remembered especially for India, because of the 
sensory exposure he could offer—food, incense, the gods and goddesses, the visitors, the 
images on slides, games. 
 
00:52:20  
Great Blue for Ken was the time of year when kids got to follow their muse. 
They get to choose anything they feel very excited about, to ask questions and try to find 
answers. It took kids so many places—a parent might come and pick up their child to take to 
the Mautz Paint Factory, little field trips for kids that parents would shepherd. It wasn’t always 
just their kid; they might take several kids who have the same interest. It would also inspire 
families to go places on spring break to find out about a kid’s project; a couple of times 
families went to someplace in the country to further research a project.

This is lifelong learning you want to see happen, getting planted in 1st and 2nd grade; it’s sad 
it doesn’t happen enough thereafter. Ken’s students had to follow through on what they were 
trying to find out, and then organize the material in a way that it could be published—
drawings, writing, diagrams, surveys that were tabulated, etc. Ken had a lot of parent help 
because he was working with very young kids. He also had friends of families and 
grandparents come in to help the kids stay focused and organized. Adults would help with the 
typing of the projects. They would write this up for the publication Great Blue, which all the 
students in the Heron Network would publish; it came out 13 or 14 times. 
 
00:56:35  
Ken thinks that over the years, his teaching got better, more effective. He 
learned how to teach reading through Direct Instruction—a totally in the box product, but it 
worked so Ken wasn’t going to fight that. Teaching now is so much more prescribed, and that 
has throttled creativity in the classroom. You have to be doing this activity on this page on this 
day. Not all schools demand that—it depends on the principal—but if you are following the 
letter of the law, you have to do that sort of thing. Ken is worried for new teachers; for 
teachers who need a lot of structure it might work, but for creative teachers who want to be 
more experimental and who want more spontaneous, inquiry-based things to happen, this 
business-model base of education won’t work. Ken mourns the fact that they will probably 
leave the profession, unless it swings back.   
 
In good teaching, there is excitement, questioning, high expectations for the kids and what 
they are able to do, collaboration, small group work, time for individual work, movement and 
noise at times, quiet at times, color and excitement, there’s outdoors and indoors, laughter, 
heaviness sometimes because you need that—management is crucial and kids have to know 
the limits. That has to become routine so that kids know how to behave, how to learn, and 
that they can trust their teacher and be able to say things that expose themselves and their 
concerns, their fears as well as their joys. 
 
01:00:55  
A lot of what Ken learned about how to teach came from himself. It’s tough, 
because teachers don’t often get to see each other teach often; they often don’t take their 
visiting days where they can go to another classroom. The collaboration with the Heron 
Network did give a taste of who these people were and how they taught, just by being around 
them. Particularly in teaching math, presenting new concepts, Ken might see some kids lose 
interest, so he had five “friends” (who were actually Ken himself) who would come at different 
times during the day, so kids would hear different voices. The kids learned to love these 
friends and would ask for them at certain times of the day, but Ken would never have them 
come when kids asked for them; it had to be spontaneous and out of the blue. So the friends 
were Dr. Alamantado, Sir, Mr. Sunshine, Cowboy Ken, and Alphonse Boronski. They all had 
different voices, from different parts of the world and country. Ken would do a certain 
movement, like spin around and they’d be there, and then do the same when they left—
suddenly the kids would be paying attention. It was a way to galvanize their interest and 
change things up enough so that they’d pay attention, and maybe help Ken to kick it up to a 
higher gear. He still uses that technique in substitute teaching—not in every class; it’s harder 
to keep control with it for older kids.

01:04:20  
Ken helps new teachers by making them part of the learning team in his 
classroom. He tells them they have to be asking questions, to get their money’s worth. They 
would meet formally once a week (although they were meeting and talking constantly in the 
classroom); they would come after school to meet with Ken and process things. This was 
important for Ken as a teacher because it kept him on his toes. He wanted to have to justify 
why he was doing certain things. He told them to ask questions even if it felt uncomfortable. 
That was always part of teaching at Wingra School; parents were always walking through your 
classroom checking it out to know if they were going to spend money to send their kid there. 
So Ken got used to having people observe him while he was teaching. Ken would involve his 
student teachers in parent-teacher conferences; they had to communicate with parents, with 
staff members, they had to do everything Ken did. It was a huge help for him, but also gave 
them a real taste of what was happening. [background sound of train]   
 
Ken’s last year, when he knew he was retiring, was very bittersweet; he was conscious that 
the culture of his classroom was ending and he mourned that. It was so much work, such as 
writing comments on report cards, but Ken wrote a lot of comments and parents appreciated 
that. In the ending of this interview, Ken is thinking about the ending of his classroom career 
and how he did mourn the closure of that room, but it was a great run, and certain aspects of 
it enter any classroom where he is subbing because he brings elements with him as he subs. 
 
01:09:48  
Ken wants to add one more thing: he wants to acknowledge Mark Wagler 
[cries]. Mark responds that Ken has been a great anchor in the world as a teacher. Ken: “You 
know, you are the taproot of the Heron Network and your leadership and inspiration has been 
huge for so many people. And even as a papa, and I just…you know, words can’t say it. You 
can see it, feel it.” It’s been a good run, teaching.
