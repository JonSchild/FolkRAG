These pits could be as much as 
200 years old.

In 06 and 07 boughs of cedar cover a corduroy

They will settle

several times, forming a spongy but quite serviceable road.

Bark trimmed off the cedars

piled on top to fill 
in the spaces.

The most important factor in their growth, 
according to Frazee, 
is a continued water supply. 
Their greatest 
natural enemy are the deer, who find them to be a great delicacy. 
The future growth of the forest basically depends upon the 
presence of the one and the absence of the other.

Island and was moved to 
its present location in 
1932. 
There are 
several explanations for the chair on top. 
Some say the previous 
owner opened a gas station in the thirties and used it to watch 
who was pilfering. 
Another 
owner was a steeplejack who used the 
steeple for practice, resting on the chair between climbs.

Clamming. 
The rake design is visible in 
13 and 15. 
In 
12 
the method of attaching the pole to the rake 
is visible. 
Cholly's innovation was to move the pin attaching rake to pole 
further down towards the rake, thereby reducing the torque and 
strain on the pole. 
The length of the pole, as seen 
in 
14 and 
17, 
can be varied (e.g., the 
sections being held 
in place by 
hose clamps). 
20: After pulling on the rake over an area, Cholly moves the boat 
downwards from his starting point by leaning on the pole, at the 
same time giving his arms a rest.
