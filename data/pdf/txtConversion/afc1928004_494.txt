Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1879, by A. J. FISHER, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
TO THE PUBLIC. 
DEAR, PUBLIC.—Once more I 
resume the pen after an 
absence of over three years from America, during which 
time 1 
have traveled and visited the following countries, 
performing in all the leading and first-class theatres, in 
conjunction with Miss Jessie Merton, the charming, viva-
cious vocalist, skater, and dancer: Commencing with 
England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany, Austria, 
Roumania, Hungary, Turkey, France, Belgium, Holland, 
Russia, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and I 
am happy 
to say we were given a 
cordial reception where ever we 
went. We once more offer to your generous criticism a 
collection of new and original songs, which we trust will 
be hailed with delight, and prove as acceptable as our for-
mer productions, it being our aim to publish nothing that 
would cause the blushing cheek to mantle, or offend the 
taste of the most fastidious ; and the songs contained in 
this little volume can be sung by any lady or genlleman 
in whatever class of society they may move. 
We remain yours truly, 
Tom HARPER, America's greatest wonder. 
Miss JESSIE MERTON, vocalist,skater, and dancer.

Hows' That For Sixty-three? 
Old Man song and dance, as performed by the original one-legged song 
and dance artist, Mr. Tom H ARPER. 
Copyrighted, 1S79, by A. 
J. 
FISHER, 24 Vesey Street, N. Y. 
Oh, its more than forty years ago, 
But I 
remember well, 
When I 
was a 
nigger dandy beau, 
And courted Dinah Bell. 
I 
saw her milking a 
brindle cow, 
Beneath a 
shady tree, 
And I 
am just as fond of my Dinah now, 
Although I 
am sixty-three. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I'm sixty-three, and it seems to me, 
I'm just as young as I 
used so be, 
Though I 
like my pipe and my glass d'ye see ? 
And the seat in the chimney corner. 
Oh, my wife will talk of the wedding now, 
And the days when we were young, 
For she's just as well, she'll often vow 
As when the bells were rung, 
She loves to sing. for she knows the ring 
Of her voice is sweet to me, 
And I 
can dance, and I 
like the chance, 
Although I 
am sixty-three. 
(Chorus). 
On the Banks of the River Ohio. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and composed by TOM HARPER, the original ONE LEGGED 
SONG AND DANCE M
. 
On the banks of the river Ohio, 
In a 
quiet flowing glade, 
Where the soft and gentle river flows 
In sunshine and in shade; 
It was there I 
saw a 
maiden fair, 
Eyes jet and breast like snow, 
And in meeting her has caused me great despair— 
Down by the Ohio. 
Beneath the trees she lay reclining (Break.) 
Her two bright eyes like stars were shining (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
And as I 
gazed upon her form, 
I 
lost my heart, you know; 
I 
won't forget the girl I 
met 
Down by the Ohio. 
I 
took courage to kiss her little hand, 
When she started like a 
fawn, 
And blushed like the rose of early morn 
That spreads all o'er the dawn. 
I 
said and would she be mine, 
She slowly answered, " No," 
And left me standing all alone 
Down by the Ohio. 
And as I 
gazed, Ste.

A 
Rose from Mother's Grave. 
Sung by Miss JESSIE MERTON. 
Words by G. COOPER. 
Music by C. A. White. 
Published by WHITP, 
SMITH & Co., 516 Washington St., Boston Mass. 
The sweetest treasure life can give 
I 
clasp unto my heart to- day, 
And childhood's golden moments live 
In dreams that soon must fade away. 
I 
see my angel mother's face, 
I 
hear her voice so true and brave, 
Her smile beams out with hallowed grace, 
From thee, my rose from mother's grave. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, 
That grassy mound where willows wave ; 
Oh precious gem of countless worth, 
My rose from angel mother's grave. 
What memories cluster around it now, 
Like jewels around some holy shrine ; 
Her loving hands are on my brow, 
Her eyes so fondly gaze in mine. 
I 
seem to gather to my breast 
The place and comfort life would crave. 
And dewy tears so fond and blest 
Are thine, dear rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, &c. 
It whispers that she dwells afar, 
And watches o'er her loved ones here ; 
Oh, brighter than the morning star 
Each thought of thee my mother dear. 
Thy loving arms again caress me 
With all the hope and joy they gave, 
While fondly to my lips I 
press 
Thy leaves, my rose from mother's grave. 
Oh, dearest spot of all on earth, & c, 
Squeeze Her Gently. 
Writ ten by THOMAS HARPER. Sung by Miss JESSIE MERTON, with great 
SUCCOS8. 
Some like courting in the rain, 
Others like it in the shade, 
Some, they do not court at all, 
For of it they seem afraid. 
For my part I'm very shy, 
Especially when my irl is nigh. 
I 
squeeze her hand and give a 
sigh, 
I 
cannot tell the reason why. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
squeeze her gently at the door, 
Kiss her once and then once more, 
Sqeeze her hand, and with a 
sigh 
Give her another and say goodbye. 
If you have a 
sweetheart true. 
And she is a 
charming girl, 
And you fall deeply in love, 
While your brain goes in a 
whirl, 
Do not let let her see you sigh, 
Or on me you may rely, 
She'll deceive you by and bye, 
Just take my advice and this you try: 
(Chorus.) 
Now, if, perchance, you married are, 
And you've got a 
darling wife, 
Everything goes smoothly on, 
And you're settled down in life, 
Do not give her her her own way, 
Or you'll see that some fine day 
With some mash she'll run away, 
So take my advice; do, I 
pray. 
(Chorus.)

Good Bire. Lovely Lou. 
AA 
sung by the dashing an accomplished vocalist, Miss JESSIE MEarow. 
Copyrighted 1879. by A. 
J. 
FISHER, 24 Vesey Street, N.Y. 
'Twas early in the month of May, I 
said to my girl Lou, 
" 
Now as I 
am going away, I 
want to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea ?" 
She bowed her lovely head, 
And placed her little hand in mine, 
And this is what she said : 
CHORUS. 
" 
Good bye, good bye, lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, 
And I 
will think of you." 
She said, "To you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought, 
But I'm told you sailors have 
A. wife in every port." 
Says I, "Now Lou, don't look so blue, 
Or deem me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget the girl, 
That I 
would leave behind." 
I 
bade adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted from the shore, 
But something seemed to tell me, 
Tuat I 
never should see her more. 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
That she had gone away, 
So now, as Lou has proved urtrue, 
Why, I 
can only say, 
(Chorus.) 
(Choru8.) 
My Sweet, Forget Me Not. 
Song and dance, as performed by Tom HARPER, the original one-legged 
skater, and song and dance artist. 
My love's a 
little blue-eyed girl, 
Who lives not far from here, 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas 
' 
In early spring last year. 
I 
was rambling through the meadows, 
Down by a 
silvery stream, 
And there I 
first met Nellie dear, 
She is my love's young dream. 
Caonus. 
I 
love her to distraction. 
St1( .11 a charming way she's got, 
She is my darling little girl, 
My sweet, forget me not. 
We chatted on together, 
And I 
helped her o'er a 
stile, 
She smiled so sweetly on me, 
We traveled for many a 
mile. 
At length the stars shone out on hi01, 
And the village clock struck nine, 
'Twa:, then I 
asked her for her hand, 
And caded her Nellie mine.

Coming Home. 
Composed and sung only by Tom HARPER, the only one-legged song 
and dance artist. 
I 
was born in America, where the fields of cotton -grow, 
And the sugar cane, the sweetest in the land, 
Where the girls are always good, and the boys are true and 
brave, 
And when I 
meet them I 
feel grand. 
I 
have traveled o'er the land, 
Many times my heart's been sad, 
But I've tried to make the most 
Of the good old times I've had. 
But the years are going fast, 
And I 
couldn't longer roam, 
And so you see Tom Harper's 
Come back home. 
Cnonus. 
Then get up early in the morn, 
I 
am coming, coming, 
Ring the bells and blow the horn, 
Let me hear the mir.
L.c 
lay. 
Tell the good folks one aid all, 
I 
am coming, coming, 
For I 
am so happy that I 
siE4 all day. 
Now, I 
have been to Ireland, where the shamrock grows 
green, 
And they gave to me a 
welcome hand, 
For they love America, does the gem of the sea, 
The reception that they gave me, it was grand. 
Then I 
went to Germany, likewise to sunny France, 
And how they all did shout when they saw me sing and 
dance. 
But, with all their kindness there I 
couldn't longer roam, 
And so you see Tom Harper's come back home.

FISHER, 24, Vesey street, IC. V. 
Kind friends, if you will listen, 
A 
song to you I 
will sing. 
It's of that great country, 
Where my father was king. 
It's of dear old Ireland, 
Where the shamrock grows green, 
And the boys and the girls, sure, 
Are the bravest ever seen. 
CITORITS. 
For I'm singing and dancing 
From morning ' till night, 
I'm a 
gay Irish lad, 
And full of delight. 
The girls, the dear creatures, 
Do all of them swear 
They're in love with Prince Patrick,) 
The pride of Kildare. 
You've heard of my fathers, 
In days that are passed. 
Were famous for fighting, 
And never were surpassed. 
And I'm their descendant, 
And this you'll agree, 
For a 
true Irish prince, 
Plaise behold one in me.

Sung by J. E. Muninty, of M URPHY A: 
M ACK, as the hit of tL•e season 
in the laughablesketch, entitled • Tbs Secret." 
There-is a 
girl of famous note 
Among the upper nine, 
Considerably comilfo, 
Or something in that line ; 
When but a 
child she answered to 
The sudden name of " Nan," 
But now her high•tuned monnygram 
Is Bidalia Jane McCann. 
CHORUS. 
Bidalia Jane McCann, the elegant Miss McCann, 
There's none so sweet as her, no girl so neat as her, 
Peggy or Julia, Johanna or Kate, like Bidalia Jane McCann, 
The elegant Miss McCann, I'm sure there's not wan, 
That can bate the bon-ton of Bidalia Jane McCann. 
Her education's wonderful, 
She spells and writes by ear, 
She plays the " Maiden's Prairie," 
And sings " Beloved Ear." 
She says, " I 
feel so fatigayed 
I 
don't know what to do," 
Says I, " Bidale, some grub and ale, 
Might help your fatigu." 
(Chorus.) 
She gives a " German" every week, 
And " Irish" too as well, 
She says a 
cork would shade my face, 
So I 
could tend the bell; 
She sings duets all by herself, 
She talks French like a 
man, 
she's very aureroir indeed, 
Is Bedelia Ikne McCann.

STA.NSILL. 
Respectfully dedicated to JOHNSON AZ 
Baum,. 
Kind friends give your attention, 
To please, is our intention; 
So listen while we mention what occurred the other day, 
While we were waking down the street, 
A 
prot,V girl we chanced to meet; 
To see her smile was such a 
treat, so bewitching and so gay, 
We bc-
)th then raised our hats at once, 
For he 112,d caught us with her glance, 
With such beauty we were entranced, this charming fairy 
Queen. 
For Cupid with his dart— [Bleak 
Has pierced this manly heart— [Break 
CHORUS. 
She's the sweetest girl we've seen, 
And her name is Emeline, 
And to win her we will try, 
And should she refuse us both, 
Then we will take an oath 
To live single 'till we die. 
We'll meet again this evening, 
When the sii ver Moon is beaming, 
And the little stars are gleaming, then we will tell our love. 
When we meet her after dr rk, 
Then we stroll around the Park ; 
She thinks it such a 
jolly lark to win from us our love; 
And though we're rivals as you see, 
And she may love him and not love me, 
Till we rind out we'll both agree, and win her if we can. 
Chorus.

STANSILL, in the Sketch 
with the above title. 
JASPER. 
I'm growing old and feeble, my hair am gettin' grey, 
My legs that once was limber am stiff and won't obey; 
My voice has lost its sweetness, the sands of life are run, 
But when I'm dead and buried you'll miss me when I'm 
gone.

What will you do without me now Winter's coming on ? 
Oh! throw your arms about me the same as you've often 
done ; 
Our children dey are married and left us here alone, 
But when I'm dead and buried they'll miss me when 
I'm gone. 
Chorus. 
HANNAH. 
Oh! Jasper don't you grieve so, you'll live for many a 
year, 
But when you talk of dying, you make me feel so queer; 
We'll both go up together and jine de Gabriel's band, 
And den we'll be so happy in dat promised land.

There is a 
fair one living near— 
I 
don't mind telling you 
She's promised for to be my bride; 
Her maiden name is Lou! 
The first time that I 
met her, 
Was down by a 
purling stream; 
And when she turned and smiled on me, 
How happy I 
did seem. 
CHORUS. 
While strolling on the beach, 
By this lovely little stream, 
This vision floated by my sight, 
Just like a 
happy dream; 
I 
never shall forget her, 
With her heart so light and true; 
There's none so fair, I 
do declare, 
As Pretty little Lou! 
I 
smiled on her and raised my hat, 
She blushed and hung her head— 
My heart kept going pit- a-pat— 
I 
scarce knew what I 
said. 
Pray pardon me, then Miss, I 
said, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude ? 
She raised her eye, and wink'd so sly, 
My pretty little Lou.

America the Land of the Free! 
Written and sung by Mn. TOM HARPER. 
RPspectfully dedicated to the Veterans of the ht)th New York 
Regiment Volunteers. 
Oh ! I've lately come from America, the land of the brave 
and free ! 
Where peace and plenty now does reign ; 
And an Irishman, there, is as good as any one, 
Although he may be a 
little green. 
When first I 
crossed the water and landed on their shore, 
They extended then, to me, a 
welcome hand; 
And they said, you're welcome here, your country to us is 
dear, 
And we love you, the Irishman. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for America, the land of the free ! 
Sure that's the place, my boys, where there is no 
slavery. 
Oh! I 
had not been there very long when a 
war broke out, 
And spread its desolation over the land; 
When they called upon the Irishman to help go and fight, 
I 
gave to them, then, a 
helping hand ; 
I 
enlisted in the ranks with many a 
noble man, 
Along with brave Corcoran and his noble crew 
And they marched us down South to what they call Dixie's 
land, 
To fight for the Red, White and Blue ! 
Then hurrah for America, kc. 
There is a 
nation that's been trying to cause America 
trouble, 
Of course, I 
mean the country called Spain ! 
But she'd better mind her business or she soon will see, 
What is her loss will be America's gain; 
For with Cuba annexed unto the United States, 
We'll add to their banner another star ; 
And I 
hope that Ireland soon will, like America, be free 
And you bet, the time is not so very far. 
Then hurrah for America, kc. 
HOME FROM THE WAR. 
Tifton by Tom HARPER, and sung with great success by 
the Author, assisted by Miss JosrE CAXTON, 
SHE. 
Old man, what is the matter, what makes you look so blue? 
Is it anything that this little girl has said or done to you ? 
If so, I 
feel so sorry, to make you look so sad, 
And if you have come home again, I'm sure you should 
be glad. 
Oh no, my child, it's nothing you've said or done to me, 
But I'm all alone in this world, without friend or family; 
And now I've nothing left me but for to pine and sigh, 
And hunt me out a 
resting place to lay me down and die. 
SEE. 
I'm sure you oughtn't to feel so, for I'm an orphan too, 
My father's gone for a 
soldier and donn'd the army blue! 
I 
suppose that he is dead, for we've never receiv'd a 
line, 
And I 
know that he is in his grave way down in Caroline. 
HE. 
It's now about ten years ago I 
left old Aunty Sue; 
I 
ran away for a 
soldier, put on the army blue; 
I 
left here my dear old wife, and Susan was her name, 
And now I 
find that she is dead, I 
wish that I 
were the 
same.

WHO'LL BUY MY PAPERS? 
Written and composed by Tom HARPER, ESQ., and sung 
with great success, by the LA 
VERDES. 
Dedicated to the Newsboys of New York. 
Oh! listen, kind stranger, and gentlemen too ! 
I've come here to sell my papeis to you ; 
All day, through the City, foot sore I 
do roam, 
I'm a 
poor little newsboy, and I 
have no home ; 
Poor Father is dead, and Mother's gone too! 
What, in this world, can a 
little boy do ? 
Shoeless—siipperless—miserable, am I— 
I 
can't sell my papers, for no one will buy. 
CHORUS. 
Come buy ? come buy a 
paper, Sir, You ? 
Here's a 
Herald, or Sun—buy one, Sir, do ? 
And a 
poor boy's blessing, then, will be yours ! 
And you'll keep starvation away from my door. 
To-night, in the snow, I 
could lay me down 
And die there, for nothing I 
meet with but frowns ; 
Forced to go hungry, day after day, 
Oh! Heaven, have pity on me I 
pray! 
And give to us all a 
plenty to-night; 
And keep my heart pure, that I 
may do right; 
Freezing—starving—miserable, am I, 
For I 
can't sell my papers, for no one will buy. 
Come buy, 3z4. 
SHINE YOUR BOOTS? 
Written by Tom HARPER. 
Sung by the LA 
VERDE. 
Dedicated to the Boot-blacks of New York. 
I'm a 
boot-black, here, in this City, 
And I've come to sing a 
ditty, 
Hoping it will excite your pity 
For the boot-blacks throughout our glorious land; 
You'll find that they are honest blades, Sir, 
And of hard work not afraid, Sir, 
Although they're in the boot-black trade, Sir ; 
So give to them a 
helping hand. 
Cnonus. 
Shine ! shine ! shine your boots, 
In a 
style that surely suits ; 
If you'll only shine your boots wiTVi 
You'll find that I'm an honest blade4 
And of hard work not afraid, 
Although I'm in the boot black trade— 
As you can plainly see, Sir. 
We know we often look seedy, 
But it's only when we are needy ; 
And with each other we are never greedy, 
But always try to do the best we can. 
How many men in our mighty Nation, 
Who are holding, now, a 
higher station., 
Have risen from an humbler occupation 
Than blacking boots, throughout the land. 
Shine! Shine! &Pot 
Now, boys, there comes a 
peeler, 
I 
know him well, for he's a 
squealer! 
He'd tell the Judge, up town, that you're a 
stealet, 
So I 
must hurry and finish up my song. 
He tells me to move off his beat, Sir, 
And he kicks me out into the street, Sir ; 
Why can't he me with kindness treat, Sir, 
For, surely, I 
do nothing wrong. 
Shine! Shine!

THERE is a 
girl not far from here, 
Who stole my heart away; 
Her eyes are bright as stars at night, 
So lively and so gay. 
We met 'twas in a 
woodland dell, 
Where berries sweet do grow: 
'Twos there we plighted both our loves, 
And I 
named her my June Rose. 
CHORUS. 
For she's just as pretty as a 
bouquet of flowetre, 
That in the garden grows; 
And she has promised to be mine, 
My lovely sweet June Rose. 
We often meet each pleasant eve, 
And wander through the grove; 
And while the moon is beaming bright, 
We whisper then our love. 
Until the parting hour comes, 
Then from her I 
must go; 
But when she's mine no more I'll part 
From my lovely sweet June Rose.

We met one summer's evening 
When the sun was sinking low, 
In Central Park, down by the fount, 
Where sparkling waters flow. 
She smiled so sweet, and then she blushed 
As I 
was passing by; 
Ilea me to- morrow evening here, 
A

Oh, yes, I

ONE afternoon ni Winter, when the snow was falling fast, 
In turning down a 
by street there a 
maid I 
chanced to pass; 
Her cheeks they looked quite ruddy, at least I 
thought them so 
I 
turned around and spoke to her, while walking in the snow. 
CHORUS. 
Walking in the snow, boys, not going very fast, 
I 
found it very pleasant, and the time so quickly pas8ed. 
I 
love this little darling, I'd have you all to know, 
I'll ne'er forget the day I 
met her, while walking in the snow. 
A 
year and more we courted, without having any strife, 
I 
asked this darling creature if she would be my wife. 
She said to me, my dearest, anon I'll let you know, 
But if I 
do, I'll ne'er forget, our walking in the snow..

It's nice to love it pretty girl, 
And that we all well know ; 
Now I 
have found a 
sweetheart, 
A 
charming little Miss, 
And that is how I 
come to know 
There's magic in a 
kiss.

They sit and pout awhile,

There's magic in it kiss.

Broadway, New York. 
Price 30 cents. 
I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh. the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
On, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again.

Some people don't like it, 
And say you cannot walk, 
While dressed in a

But that is foolish talk; 
They are only jealous, 
And to that you agree, 
So if you like the fashion, 
Get pinned back just like me.

The Raffle for the Stove 
Written, composed and sung with great success by J. E. Monenv, of 
M URPHY k. Macs, at the London Variety Theatre, N. Y., in the 
laughable eketch, entitled " Murphy's Dream," lor IOU 
consecutive nights. 
Music published and copyright 1879, by E. H. Harding, 229 Bowery, and 
sent to any address, post-paid, on receipt of 35 cents. 
Last "Wednesday I 
attended 
A 
raffle for a 
stove, 
In aid of the wife and family 
Of Timothy J. Cosgrove. 
Kellys, Hogans, and O'Briens, 
All came in a 
drove, 
To take the dice and shake them nice, 
And try and win the stove. 
CHORUS. 
Forward four, allaman left, while the music it did play, 
'Twas grand delight to see the sight of those Irishmen so 
gay, 
I 
never laughed so hearty in the course of all my life 
Looking at Plug McCarty, pivotin' with his wife. 
At nine o'clock precisely 
The raffling it begun, 
Tom Kelly he jumped ten foot high 
When sixty-four was flung; 
O'Brien yelled out murder, 
With a 
brick his eye was closed ; 
On that night I 
had to fight, 
While raffling for the stove. 
At six o'clock in the morning 
The raffling it was o'er, 
Tom Kelly he got staving drunk 
And stole away the door; 
Clancy with a 
bott.e, 
Sure he all the windows broke; 
Cosgrove grabbed him by the neck, 
And boys, I 
thought he'd choke. 
Written expressly for, and sung by the MURDOCHS. 
Don't talk to me of kings and earls, 
Wearing crowns and coronets, 
The men who snub our boys and girls, 
But never pay their debts; 
But give me those who work ail(1 strive, 
To gain success at last, 
The man who labors hard to thrive, 
And never lives too fast. 
CHORUS. 
Then cheer him on I 
cheer him on! 
The laboring man for me, 
Cheer him on I 
cheer him on! 
The man of honesty; 
Cheer him on I 
help him on! 
The free- born man of toil, 
The laboring man for me, boys, 
The honor to our soil. 
Giv( him a 
place among the great, 
With those whose names are stainless, 
He'd be a 
blessing to the State, 
How he'd bounce the brainless! 
Their hands are rough their hearts are pure, 
They're down on tyranny, 
The man I'd like, though he be poor, 
The laboring man for me. 
Then cheer him on, etc. 
EVA TO HER PAPA. 
Sung by " M ABEL LEONARD," in her wonderful imper-

When your daughter's ta'en away, 
And your heart is filled with care; 
When with Angels I 
shall pray, 
For your peace and comfort here; 
Shall f

Papa, promise this to me. 
When your little Eva's there, 
Robed like those in spotless white, 
And the conqu'ring palm I 
bear, 
Blessed with love and Heaven's light; 
Shall poor Uncle Tom be free ? 
Papa, promise this to me. 
Wife and children send him near, 
When forever I 
am gone,— 
papa, check the falling tear, 
Think upon my dying song. 
Uncle Tom, oh! make him free I 
Papa, promise this to me 
Written for TONY PASTOR, by FRANk DUMONT. 
ONCE again I 
claim attention, 
While I 
sing these several lines, 
And a 
motto I 
will mention, 
One of course to suit the times. 
Sonic folks we're ever meeting, 
Through the world they go on cheek, 
Yet we know in spite of smiling, 
They are drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
They are drifting down the creek. 
There's a 
friend who once had money, 
Now ' tis gone, he wants a 
lift, 
Make his days of darkness sunny, 
Never let him go adrift ; 
Even Grant, the nation's ruler, 
Distant cousins he will seek, 
" 
Dents' and presents he will never, 
Send them drifting down the creek. 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
He will nevr send them down the creek. 
Politicians too are needing, 
To keep open wide their eyes. 
The people's voice they'll soon be healing, 
That will crush their plots and lies, 
Congress with its shares of railroad, 
MObilier stocks as presents seek, 
Colfax, Ames and all those fellows, 
Send them drifting down the creek ; 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
Send them sailing down the creek. 
In conclusion I 
will mention, 
Should any powers ever strive, 
To tread upon this Yankee nation, 
They'll find the " boys in blue" alive, 
With the menfry of our chieftain, 
George Washington of him I 
speak, 
Columbia rushes like a 
whirlwind, 
And sends them drifting down the creek, 
Down the creek, down the creek, 
l'iend them scattering down the creek, 
I 
LOVE the white girl and the black, 
And I 
love all the rest; 
I 
love the girls for loving me, 
But I 
love myself the best. 
Oh dear, I 
am so thirsty; 
I've just been down to supper; 
I 
drank three pails of apple-jack, 
And a 
tub of apple-butter. 
CHORUS. 
0, a 
little more cider too, 
A 
little more cider too; 
A 
little more eider for Miss Dinah, 
A little more cider too. 
When first I 
saw Miss Snow Flake, 
'Twas on Broadway I 
spied her; 
I'd give my hat and boots, I 
would, 
It I 
could been beside her. 
She looked at me, I 
looked at her, 
And then I 
crossed the street; 
And ther_ she smiling said to ine, 
A 
little more cider sweet. 
0, P 
little more eider too, etc. 
Oh, I 
wish I 
was an apple, 
And Snow Flake was another; 
Oh what a 
pretty pair we'd makes 
Upon a 
tree to -other 
Row bad de darkies all would feel, 
When on the tree they spied her, 
To think how we would be 
When we're made into cider. 
0, a 
little more cider too, etc. 
But now old age came creeping, 
We grow down and don't get bigger; 
And cider sweet and sour then, 
And I 
am just the nigger ; 
But let the cause be what it will, 
Short, small, or wider, 
She am de apple of my soul, 
And I'm bound to be beside her. 
0, a 
little more cider too, etc.

PAPA, dear, come sit by Willie, 
Said a 
little dying boy, 
I 
have not long to be with you 
Ere I 
pass to peace and joy. 
His father hastened to his bedside 
And fondly his little forehead pressed; 
Death, he found, was fast approaching, 
And soon his boy would be at rest. 
CHORUS. 
Farewell, papa, I

When I'm gone don't weep or sigh; 
Do not let this parting grieve you. 
Good-by, papa dear, good-by!

see mamma 
'Midst angels beautiful and bright, 
In robes of radiance and splendor 
Watching o'er my bed at night. 
When your darling boy has left you, 
Let me ne'er cause you grief or pain; 
Though on earth we both be parted, 
We shall meet in heaven again. 
Farewell, papa, etc. 
Oh, papa, I 
see little angels, 
With my twown their coming night 
His father smoothed back his curly locks, 
littered naught, but gave a 
sigh. 
Reclining with his face towards heaven, 
He placed his hands across his breast, 
He offered up a 
dying prayer, 
And passed to happiness and rest. 
Farewell, papa, no:

FRIENDS THAT STAND BY US, 
Written and Sung, with great success, by Wm. COURTRIGHT. 
NOW, then, subjects for songs nowadays are so scarce, 
And to find one I've looked far and near every Lay; 
And the more that I've looked, it seems more like a 
farce, 
For its something like looking fcr needles in hay. 
There's a 
song for the rich, the poor and the sot, and 
The aristocrat's conscience so -weak and so dim, 
But now for a 
song of those friends ne'er forgotten, 
The friends that stood by us through thick and through 
thin. 
We'll first take the babe, as its nursed in the cradle, 
As its papa and mamma cries dear little elf, 
And vigorously uses one end of the ladle, 
I've no doubt you all know how the thing works your-
self. 
Now, boys, should a 
father or mother advise you, 
Pray do not get hot-headed and call it a 
whim, 
For right its their wish you can wager to guide you, 
They're the friends to stand by you through thick and 
through tn.

poor bumble station, 
But you must judge a 
man by his actions and deeds. 
At times when our old starry flag was in danger, 
Uncle Sam wanted brave hearts his battles to win, 
Our foreign friends, boys, were the first to endanger 
Their lives to stand by us through thick and through 
thin. 
Our great war is over, our bright starry emblem 
O'er thousands of freedmen in triumph now wave. 
God bless our brave soldiers, who that flag protected, 
Who gave up their lives, and now sleep in their grave. 
Our southern friends, boys, were true and brave soldiers, 
They stood their ground manly, and tried hard to win. 
And should they be called to expel some invader, 
I 
know they'd stand by us through thick and through 
thin.

when the sun of prosperity's shining, 
And man's growing richer each day, 
When in ease and comfort reclining, 
And golden success crowns his way; 
How friends then will gather around him! 
But if fortune should happen to frown, 
He finds that his former " good fellows" 
Will kick him as soon as he's down! 
When poor and astray, a 
man's in the way; 
He meets all around him a

Then reckless and sad, he " goes to the bad," 
Because he is kick'd when he's down 1

Kiss Me, Love, Before I 
Go. 
(2c -r.pocd by Wm. A. 
H UNTLEY, and sung by DAVE W AMBOLD, of the 
San Francisco Minstrels. 
I 
must leave you, love, to-morrow, 
Leave you here, to roam afar, 
And it gives me pain and sorrow, 
Since I've learned how dear you are. 
Well I 
know you'll not be near me, 
As I 
wander to and fro; 
So, to comfort and to cheer me, 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
CHORUS. 
Sweetest thoughts of thee I'm keeping, 
Smiles of thine should brightly glow; 
Can I 
go and leave you weeping, 
Kiss me, then, before I 
go. 
You will sit here in the gloaming, 
As you have so oft before, 
1-3ut you'll wait in vain my coming 
To the little cottage door. 
For 'mid other scenes and pleasures 
I 
shall wander to and fro; 
If your heart keep mine in treasure, 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
Sweetest thoughts, & c. 
You may never sit beside me, 
Never hold my hand again ; 
Yet your sunny face will guide me, 
In the sunshine, in the rain. 
Where on earth I 
chance to wander, 
Still a 
memory sweet and low, 
Of the faded past I'll ponder— 
Kiss me, love, before I 
go. 
Sweetest thoughts, &c. 
As sung by Jous C. Duos, in San Francisco, Call. 
Gently the moon mounts the sky, 
Stars their nightwatch do keep, 
And why let those tears dim thine eye? 
Thine were not made, love, to weep. 
Look up and tell me you love me, 
Grief nearly breaks my poor heart, 
Smile once again in mine eye, 
Then kiss me, kis me, ere we part. 
CHORUS. 
Good bye, darling, good bye, 
Do not grieve or miss me, 
I 
must go; I 
leave you weeping, 
So good by darling, kiss me. 
Farewell my loved one, my own, 
Oh, but be true unto me, 
Soon will my life bark be thrown 
Out on the tempest at sea. 
I'm going, my darling, I 
love thee, 
Lips speak the love of the heart, 
Smile once again ere I 
go, 
Then kiss me, kiss me, ere we part,

There was 'a man whose name was Dan, 
And a

And every day he was away, 
But he always came home to tea, 
Arid the people knew, that whatever he might do, 
And wherever he might be, 
In India, or China, or in South Carolina, 
He always came home to tea. 
He always owne home to tea, 
Wherever he might be, 
This man call'd Dan, 
This regular man, 
He always came home to tea.

And he sai!ed to a 
city on the spree, 
And he caught a 
shiver, on the river Guadelquiver, 
But he always came back to tea. 
The next day Dan went off to Japan, 
Around by Tar-ta-ree; 
Oh, didn't he spoon, in the mountains of the moon, 
But he always came home to tea.

A 
boat he took from " Tubbie Hook," 
To the Falls of Nia-ga-ree; 
He walked the ridge of Brooklyn Bridge, 
But he always came home to tea. 
He would take the train, and cross the raging main, 
To that savage coast, Jer-see, 
His wife remark'd with pleasure, ' What a 
family treasure,' 
He always comes home to tea.

To Tim-buc-too, with a 
very jolly crew, 
He would dine with a

Then in Tipperary, he would trip it like a

But he always came home to tea I 
Then up Broadway, he'd stop on his way, 
To far-off Flor-a-dee, 
Oh, there he would smile, with a

I 
was once the queen of the ballet so gay, 
The greatest artist ever seen on the stage; 
In the art Terpsichore, a 
sweet beauty in fact, 
I 
set the whole town in a 
rage. 
Engaged by Jarrett and Palmer each week, 
To do the solos in the Crook; 
I 
would fascinate your dears, 
With my loving, languishing look.

My name on the bills was Silvina Malki, 
My real name was Johannah McGee; 
So fluent I 
speak the French language, oh my, 
That's warbled in Tip-per-rare-e. 
The young men would call me a 
dazzler so swyet, 
Delightful, entrancing they'd say, 
Now I'm forced to make shirts for the supers I 
meet, 
Oonsidered by all en passe. 
Dancing in the ballet, &c.

I 
was so bewitchingly, graceful and neat, 
in slow movements slay ,overs, ttS there I 
excel', 
Mountains of bouquets and flowers so sweet, 
Was thrown to this pretty gazelle. 
The young girls would say, what a 
beauty and siek. 
As around on my toes I 
would spin; 
the back line of ballet, I'll stop till I 
die, 
Because I'm so dreadfully thin. 
Dancing in the ballet, kc. 
When standing amidst the coryphees there, 
I 
make such a 
sweet-looking fairy-like queen 
Could stand on the end of a 
needle, 
And turn or float in cloud in the air. 
My dresses were made and brought out from Pari$, 
Most gorgeously trimmed round with gold; 
Now I'm in the back line of the ballet, 
gimply because I 
am old.

For want of a

Arrah! me honey, &c, 
There's snug little bureau, without paint or gilt, 
Made of boords that was left when the shanty was built: 
There's a 
thiee-cornered mirror hangs up on the wall, 
The divil a

Arrah! me honey, &c. 
He has pigs in the sty, and a 
cow in the stable, 
And he feeds them on scraps from the table ; 
They'd starve if confined, so they roam at their aise, 
And come into the shanty whinever they plaise. 
Arrah! me honey, &c. 
Be has three rooms in one—kitchen, bedroom and halt , 
And his chist is three wooden pegs in the wall; 
Two suits of owhi clothes makes his wardrobe complete, 
One to wear in the shanty, that same for the street. 
Arrah! me honey, &c. 
He can relish good victuals as ever ye's ate,

He prefers them when cawhl ( if lie can't get them hot), 
And makes tay in a

There is one who partakes of his sorrows and joys, 
Attends to the shanty, the girls mill the bo3-s ;

Arrah! me honey, & c.

With those who have riches as great as their own; 
But Pat hangs the latch-string outside of his door, 
And will share his last cent with the needy and poor.

These Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
• 
ad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
• 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the IL S.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arrangea 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such '4, way as to be non-co.nmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
astlernen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
trom doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
'tient. 
As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mieht have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
