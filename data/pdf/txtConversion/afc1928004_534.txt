Washington, D. C. 
Parody on " Mary Kelly's Beau," as sung by HARRIGAN & HART at 
the THEATRE COMIQUE. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. 
Little Patsy Kelly, 
A 
dandy very small; 
Sells evening papers, 
On the Bowery for a 
Ball. 
The gang upon the corner, 
Not many days ago; 
Introduced me ye's can bet, 
As Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
CHORUS: 
Dandy Patsy Kelly, a 
Handy Andy lad, 
When I'm strolling with him the mashers get it bad; 
Its naughty, but nicey, I'm still a 
friend to you, 
Go tell it to your Fairies, I 
am Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
He lives in Mulligan's building, 
Just up nine flights of stairs; 
He keeps his Father and Mother, 
And Silks and Satins wears. 
He takes care of his Brother, 
His Sister to Jail did go; 
Oh swell the story all around, 
I'm Patsy Kelly's Beau. 
Down around the bloody Fourth, 
He's a 
Politician tart; 
And after Election day, 
To Congress be will start. 
I 
live upon 5th Avenue, 
Wear a 
Gold Ring on my toe; 
The speilers tells the Daisies, 
I'm Paty Kelly's Beau,

RED HAIRED KATY SO CONTRARY. 
Parody on " Sandy-Haired Mary in our Area," as sung by 
HARRIGAN (3.7 HART. 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT. 
I 
board at Mrs. Reilly's, 
I 
have a 
big back room; 
There's a 
little Italian fairy, 
That has me gone to ruin. 
Her name is Katy Brady, 
And every night at eight; 
Sweet sounds of music, 
By our Red-Haired Kate. 
CHORUS: 
I'm her daisy, she's my love, 
She ain't the only one I 
love, 
She's a 
gem, yes, she is silly, she's airy; 
She's a 
cake, don't mistake, 
She'll be Mrs. Brogan yet, 
Dear Red-Haired Katy so contrary. 
See smiles at every Peeler, 
Traveling on the Street; 
The Ash-man in the morning, 
He has such awful feet. 
The Tarrier keeps the Grocery, 
He swears he will her mate; 
And hugs her, yes, the rascal, 
Contrary Red-Haired Kate. 
I'm her dal” etc.

RED-HAIRED KATY SO CONTRARY—CONTINUED. 
The man who carries banners, 
The old Hibernian Clown; 
He hollers in the alley, 
For Katy to come down. 
It makes me nearly looney, 
To see her start a 
gait; 
To smile upon the Tanier, 
With the Red-Haired Pate. 
I'm her daisy, etc. 
The Junk-man and the Tailor, 
The Beggar for his Bread; 
The Bummer and the Bruiser, 
Have nearly killed me dead. 
A 
crazy Cabinet-maker, 
Has broken me heart complate; 
He elopes with her next Tuesday, 
My darling Red- Haired Kate. 
CHORUS: 
I'm her daisy, she's my love, 
She ain't the only one I 
love, 
She's a 
gem, yes, she's silly, she's airy; 
She's a 
cake, don't mistake, 
She'll be Mrs. Brogan yet, 
Dear Red- Haired Katy so contrary. 
PARODY ON PITCHER OF BEER, 
As sung by H ARRIDAN & H ART in the Mulligan Guard's Picnic. 
Written by JAMES RICHMOND. 
I 
am a 
friend to the Millionaire, when he is drunk, 
Though from a 
Millionaire I 
am far away; 
My Pa he is rich, he owns a 
wood's and a 
ditch, 
And gets seventy-five cents every day. 
He spends money free for coffee and tea, 
And often it does turn his brain; 
To see himself drinking water because he is poor, 
And the rich drink from their bottle of champagne. 
CHORUS: 
Then each week in the night, each year in the month, 
It will snow, it will blow, or it will rain; 
While the rich is draining beer-kegs on some lonely street, 
While the poor man is drinking champagne. 
The poor go to Long Branch for the good of their health 
The Herald and the Sun is the proof; 
They smoke $2.00 cigars, go in bathing in silks, 
While the rich have to sleep on the roof. 
Its a 
shame poor factory girls can't wear diamond rings 
If she catches a 
mash at a 
ball, he is insane; 
He'll buy her a 
doughnut and a 
three cent lemonade, 
And imagine she is drinking champagne. 
CHORUS: 
Then take my advice, sleep on a 
cake of ice, 
If you're got a 
bad reputation, rub out the stain; 
The Queen of Cincinnati has to drink milk, 
While Dennis Kearney is drinking champagne,

TERRY DUGAN'S NIECE. 
Parody on " Mary Kelly's Beau," as sung by H ARRIDAN At H ART in 
Volume 6th, Mulligan Guard's Pie-Nie. 
By RICHARD J. 
Piourr. 
Copyright 1880, by Mrs. PAULINE ', LEDER. 
Come gather round ye laddy bucks, 
An' let yees hould yer whist; 
While I 
describe a 
pretty lass, 
As sweet as e'er was kissed. 
The mashers whin she walks abroad, 
Around her flock like geese; 
With lots of cash, to try and mash, 
Ould Terry Dugan's Niece. 
CHORUS: 
She weighs a 
hundred and a 
spike, 
And hits a 
powerful blow; 
She'll lick her weight in pratee-bugs, 
At least they tell me so. 
She's traveled 'round and 'round the globe— 
Is known from here to Greece; 
'Twould turn your pate, to see the gait, 
Of Terry Dugan's Niece. 
She's such a 
lovely dancer, too, 
She'd break a 
fellow's heart; 
The way she Knickerbocker's 'round 
In such a 
manner " tart;" 
Her Montague's beneath her hat, 
Are plastered on with grease; 
I'll bet me hat, there's nothing that, 
Compares with Dugan's Niece. 
Chorus. 
Sure Terry keeps a 
bucket-shop, 
And owns a 
block or two; 
Of tenements in Cherry Street, 
Excelled in style by few. 
Sure when he dies, his Niece and I, 
Will married be, and peace 
And comfort we'll enjoy forever, 
Alesilf and Dugan's Niece.

LOCKED OUT AFTER NINE. 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN, and sung by TI AnniaAN & HART ID 
VOL 6th 
Mulligan Guard's Pic-Nie. 
I'm stopping at a 
boarding-house - 
Kept by Misses Doyle; 
The rules and regulations 
Are forniust us all the while. 
Two meals a 
day was all we got, 
We set down in a 
line. 
'Twas every man in bed at eight, 
Or locked out after nine. 
CHORUS: 
There was Slotty McGonigal, 
McAllister and 0:Burke, 
A Scandinavian fisherman, 
A Norwegian and Turk. 
The ladies, the babies, 
Were crying all the time, 
Every man in bed at eight, 
Or locked out after nine. 
At a 
rousing demonstration, 
Held up in Union Square, 
Tammany Hall Republicans 
And anti-Tams was there. 
Our boarders congregated 
To see the sight so fine; 
Gilligan wanted it stopped at eight, 
We got home after nine. 
There was Slotty, McGonigal, etc. 
Thero was Slotty McGonigal 
A 
kicking on the door, 
The ladies and the babies 
For Miss Doyle did roar. 
We woke up all the neighbors, 
The tailor Constantine 
Turned out the fire department 
When we was locked out after nine. 
There was Slotty McGonigal, eto. 
There was a 
row next morning, 
Wid all the boarders drunk; 
Miss Doyle she got excited 
And threw out every trunk. 
Hat boxes and valises, 
And shirts from off tho line, 
Came out wid all the lodgers 
Bekase we got home after nine. 
There was Slotty McGonigal, etc. 
Wid vengeance they did roar; 
They rushed for bricks 
And heavy sticks 
To batter down the door. 
'Twas then they got the collar, 
Three long months wid a 
fine, 
Was their conciliation 
For coming home after nine. 
There was Slotty MeGonigal, etc.

Parody on Babies on Our Block. 
Written and sung by Billy Carter with great suoness 
You can talk of ugly babies, 
On onr block it is a 
sight, 
To see a 
thousand babies chaw 
And claw with all their might. 
There is pug-nosed babies, goggle-eyed kids, 
And some of the good old stock, 
It's a 
regular menagerie, 
The babies on the block. 
Mrs. Grady's got a 
baby 
That talked before 'twas born, 
Another by the name of Simpson, 
With a 
nose like a 
Wm. goat's horn ; 
They'll get squalling and bawling, 
And they'd gather in a 
flock, 
Barnum ought to make a 
call 
On the babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Johnny Toothpick 
And Susan Turpentine, 
A 
crying and a 
fighting, 
And a 
singing Baby Mine; 
They'd take the chromo cake and all 
For smashing Grandpa's clock, 
They'd win the prize for swallowing flies, 
These babies on our block. 
11 
PARODY ON BABIES ON OUR BLOCK—CONTINUED. 
There's an Italian kid just two years old, 
With eyes in the back of his head, 
You can guess how the daddy feels 
When the young one's hair is red; 
Some have got no eyes, and some have got no nose, 
And a 
black and tan kid 
With an elephant hoof 
And forty-'leven toes; 
Some's dramatic, some's lunatic, 
One kid has a 
wooden ear, 
Another one, they call Napoleon, 
Drinks his barrel of lager beer. 
They'll rear and tare, 
And pull their hair, 
Until your nerves they shock, 
They'll scream and yell, 
And raise old fun, 
The babies on our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Falseteeth, 
Sitting in a 
custard pie, 
A 
crying 'cause her little brother 
Slugged her in the eye. 
Rise, Sally, rise, knock his eye out with a 
rock, 
For there's a 
hundred times more babies 
Than there's daddies on our block.

The Order of Old Bums. 
Written by Jerry Cohan and sung with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The secret order of old bums, for gall will take the cake, 
They recognize the pass word, it's " What'll you have to 
take ?" 
We likes to drink, we likes to eat, and don't waste drops 
or crumbs, 
Cops and rounders all are on to the order of old bums. 
CHORUS. 
The first degree—charge it to me—then your eye you 
wink, 
The bottle tip, the glass you grip—password—What d'ye 
drink ? 
For the back of your neck and the seat of your pants, 
The landlord gently comes, 
And lands you on the sidewalk in the order of old bums. 
When the little cop is staying, in some door way for a 
snooze. 
The " Bums" are on the war-path laying, 
For a 
lunch, a 
grasshopper, or booze, booze, booze. 
13 
'flit ORDEIt OP aro BUMS.—Continued. 
The watermelon season for a 
change will sometimes suit, 
And when we can't get soft shell crabs why then we'll 
tackle fruit. 
We work the bar for all it's worth till the landlord for us 
comes, 
We furnish politicians from the order of old bums. 
FIRST DEGREE SET TO. 
In the spring time and the summer, 
To the green fields and hen roosts off we goes, 
But in the winter the poor bummer, 
Must hustle in the jail for feed and clothes. I 
suppose. 
SECOND DEGREE SET TO. 
The object of this order is to walk when we can't ride, 
And fill ourselves with lager from the empty keg outside, 
We smoke the best Havana buts, and share 'em with our 
churns. 
And an unprotected clothesline is a Christmas for the 
bums. 
THIRD DEGREE SET TO. 
At election time it is our oyster— 
To the polls we gently, gently stray, 
And of schooners the bum is then a 
hoister, 
As he samples with the keg election day. 
What d'ye say.

Widow Dunn (Parody). 
Sung by Billy Carter. 
Dedicated to Harrington and Hart. 
I 
know a 
big fat widow, 
That keeps a 
livery stable, 
A 
making beds for horses that are sick, 
She's an awful early riser, 
And a 
champion appetizer, 
Like an eight-day clock 
She goes around on tick. 
She's from the country poor-house, 
Her husband was a 
tramp, 
In the English army he did beat a 
drum, 
And for singing tar-heeled Hanna's, 
Or murdering sick pianos, 
There's no marker for the big fat Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is hunky, she is chunky, 
She's as handsome as a 
monkey, 
She's a 
fairy, she's contrary, 
She's a 
lamb, Ir. mean a 
ham, 
She's as tall as any ladder, 
I'd slug her if I 
had her, 
And kick the chest protector off the Widow Dunn. 
3 
WIDOW DUNN ( PARour).—CoNTINuEn. 
She steals the morning papers 
Away from every door, 
She's an acrobactic, break-neck son of a 
gun,-
And at every wake or funeral, 
She goes to sing and dance, 
Such a 
tender creature is the widow Dunn. 
She's freckled, but she's pretty, 
And well developed feet, 
She has one back tooth that weighs a 
half a 
ton, 
And at every passing stranger 
She fires an ancient egg, 
So familiar is the Widow Dunn. 
CHORUS. 
She is moody, she is sankey, 
She's consumptive, she is crankey, 
She's rheumatic, she's lunatic, 
She's a 
bum, she weighs a 
ton, 
She is crazy, she is careless, 
She is toothless, she is hairless, 
Such a 
chromo is the big fat Widow Dunn.

Parody on Full Moons. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sang with great success by 
Billy Carter. 
The noble order of Ancient Bums, 
That ain't got any stamps, 
Are trying to form a 
No-work Club 
With the always-idle tramps. 
They sit in oviThy
. public park, 
Or lay upon the grass, 
And beg a 
chew of tobacco, boys, 
From any one who'l pass. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
Then march down Broadway, 
They pick up stumps and work the pumps, 
They're the terrors of the day. 
CHORUS. 
When the little tramps are begging, 
They say they never begged before, 
They'll sleep in a 
cart or some alley, 
And beg at every basement, basement door. 
They take the road the 1st of may, 
Put lightning on their heels, 
And steal the farmers chickens and corn 
If they don't get three square meals; 
Beat every freight train in the land, 
When they're catched they make 'em sick, 
And when snow falls upon the ground 
To the city double quick. 
The first to eat, the first to drink, 
They're as quiet as a 
mouse when asking 
The Captain of Police for to sleep in the Station House. 
Chorus. 
THE OLD SLAVE'S REQUEST. 
Written and composed by EDWIN TALBOT. Dedicated to MR. EDWARD 
FIARRIGAN, of the Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
OLD MAN CHARACTER BONG. 
Lord I 
am coming up to dis yah glory, 
To follow my Loved one's in the Sky; 
I 
am tired of the sin down below here, 
And I'll tell you the reason why. 
I 
am weak and weary, so sad and weary to-night, 
I 
think I 
hear the Angels call, calling me home to-night; 
And when the sun is setting way far beyond the mill, 
I'll sing the old, old story, and climbing Zion's Hill. 
CHORUS: 
Den come this way children, 
I 
am on my journey home; 
Good-bye old Snow Drop Nancy, 
Farewell old Aunty Chlo. 
Jest hand the instrument down to me, 
I 
mean de old Banjo; 
And I 
will play my last farewell, 
Then Angels carry me home. 
Oh Lord let me be happy, let me walk the Golden Street, 
Where everything is lovely, and the Angels look so sweet; 
I 
want to be up higher, my massa he's gone there, [there. 
And though I'm old and feeble, I'll sing and dance when 
I'll send down blessed tidings when trouble you offends, 
At sunrise every morning, I'll bread from Heaven send; 
Then good-bye now I'm happy, good-bye, fare you well, 
I'm climbing up the ladder, and ringing Heaven's bell.

"Order of Green Cheese.",

Und drink noding but beer.

Then they Chase the Landlord from the Door. 
Written by Edwin Talbot for Pat Rooney and sung by him 
with great success. 
A1R—" Never take the Horseshoe from the Door," as sung 
by Harrigan & Hart. 
Every month the rent is handed to the landlord, 
In the tenement house, where the families congregate, 
Then Mrs. Duffy says that Mrs. Reilly's daughter, 
In the sink threw dirty cabbage and corn mate. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, then they get a 
drinking and a 
slugging, 
It's worse than listening to the Pinafore, 
But when Kelly throws ashes at Terry Monaghans mother, 
Arrah, it's then then they chase the landlord from the 
door. 
Mrs. McNally had sixteen shirts upon a 
clothes line, 
And a 
brand new suit of dresses from the store, 
Young Kelly's son he stole them and he pawned them, 
You can bet she chased the young kid from the door. 
Last night her daughter Mary Ann the speeler, 
Was standing with a 
young man she met before, 
Some one dropped out a 
scuttle full of cinders, 
To chase the dizzy lovers from the door, 
The milk is left up in the hallway every morning, 
From Jacob McCarthy's german grocery store, 
When he tries to collect his bill they give him warning, 
And chase the poor old milkman from the door.

Cheese It, Jimmie, Cheese It. 
Written by Edwin Talbot, and sung with great success by 
Pat Rooney. 
AIR—Bogie Man. 
The boys hanging around the public baths, 
How patiently they wait, 
The policeman tries to keep them quiet, 
And pass them in the gate, 
They push and pull to sneak in twice, 
And get another swim, 
But the copper drops and tells them, 
Young fellow that's too thin. 
CHORUS. 
Then cheese it, Jimmy, cheese it, 
Now lay bones for your chance, 
Don't you see the copper will sneak, 
And slug in the pants. 
Then cheese it, Petey, cheese it, 
I 
tell you he will drop, 
Now go and dry your hair now quick, 
Now sherry here is the cop. 
They put seventeen boys in a 
little room, 
About as big as a 
dry goods box, 
You'll hear them say, my clothes is wet, 
I 
wonder where is rccks, 
They put on their shoes upon the dock, 
Buy a 
bolivar if the've got tin, 
Then dry up their hair and watch the police, 
And work the bath again. 
Jerry Slattery. 
As sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 11379. 
Jerry Slattery was a 
tailor, he was ninety years of age, 
He had a 
son named Micky, a 
play actor on the stage. 
He'd play Romeo with his sister, for diamonds he'd give her 
pork and beans, 
Then little Michael Slattery would tear the bedclothes up for 
scenes. 
He is crazy, he is lazy, he broke his leg last week, 
lie is always singing, always dancing, and playing tragedy in 
his sleep. 
He is always talking of Mary Anderson, he'd support her on 
the stage, 
Sure last night he got so crazy, we had to put him in a 
cage. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's little Michael Slattery stole his father's pants, 
He cut them up for tights to do a 
song and dance; 
When his mother was asleep he cut her hair off for a 
wig, 
Now little Micky Slattery is doing an acrobatic jig. 
He cut off his father's whiskers to play Hamlet and King Lear, 
Took a 
shot gun to his mother and made her walk off on her ear, 
He learned his sister dancing, cut off eleven of her toes, 
Now little Micky Slattery is singing tenor through his nose. 
For he's dramatic, he's lunatic, he is clean gone off his base, 
His father and his mother say he is a 
Celebrated Case, 
He says he takes the cake, as an actor he beats them all, 
Next week he plays Julius Caesar down at Solomon Duff's 
hall. 
Then it's little, &c.

My Mary Ann. 
Sung by LARRY TOOLEY. 
My Mary Ann's a 
bruiser, 
I 
often try to lose her, 
She can not and won't be forced to die. 
She can paralyze a 
chicken, 
She is all the time a 
kicking— 
She's one of the girls that's always on the fly. 
Oh, she's gone on beef and mutton, 
She's a 
perfect glutton, 
She strikes terror to a 
Coney Island clam. 
She beat O'Leary walking, 
And Doctor Talmage talking— 
Such a 
constitution has my Mary Ann. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
greasy, 
She can kick the stuffing out of any man. 
She licked Tom Collins twice, 
I 
had to put her on ice— 
Such a 
constitution has my Mary Ann. 
My Mary Ann is a 
stunner, 
She is a 
perfect bummer,

She's all the time a

Her clothes is out of fashion,

Oh, you'll alw ays find her lushing, 
You can smell her breath from Flushing, 
And the gang all szy she isn't worth a

She used to go with Beecher, 
And she often tried to teach hiiii 
To be a 
little tender on the lamb. 
She's a

The Coons Around Our Block. 
BANJO SOLO. 
JAMES D. 
ROOME'S latest hit. 
Written for him by J. M . 
TURNER. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
If you've been vaccinated, take a 
walk with me to-night, 
I'll show you where the niggers and the Irish had a 
fight. 
Yon see old nigger Johnson hit McCarthy with a 
rock, 
Because McCarthy's kids were singing " Niggers on our block." 
The Fagans slugged he Johnsons, and the Johnson's they 
slugged back, 
And razors and shillalies were used by white and black. 
The 5lood flowed free as water, and it looked just like a 
dock 
Where they whipped the gang of niggers, who were living on 
our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Dusenbury crying with the croup, 
Trying to pick her teeth with a 
brown stone stoop, 
Rise, Sally Bounce, wipe your eyes out with a 
rock, 
Go tie an anchor round your neck,. and then jump off the dock. 
You can hear them in the summer and the winter just the same 
The cross-eyed, spavined, red haired, hump backed, blind, the 
!mit and lame; 
They form in long procession, and they march down to 
the dock, 
The nigs and whites singing 'bout the " Niggers on our block." 
It's 'nough to drive one crazy, they've nearly got me mad, 
They average ninety young ones to just about one dad; 
The mother, too, is busy, for she's adding to the flock 
-o 
join the army singing bout the " Niggers on our block." 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Dead-eye sitting in the sun, 
Crying and wet ;: ng for her daddy number one. 
Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your eyes out with your sock, 
You ain't the only kid who has no daddy o.i the block.

BILLY BARRY'S PARODY MEDLEY. 
Written and sung by Billy Barry, and also sung with great success by 
Hyde & Behinan. 
Ant—My Pretty Jane. 
My watch, my watch, I 
pawned my watch, 
For heaven's sake I 
tell you keep it dark, 
I 
told my darling wife I 
lost it, 
While hunting for stumps in Prospect Park. 
AIR—Babies on Our Block. 
Little Sallie Falseteeth standing in the mud, 
Some one chewing tobacco hit her with a 
cud; 
Rise, Sallie, rise, go home and wash your feet, 
Is sung by all the children with hair upon their teeth. 
Ant—Bell Trio. 
Ring the bells, call in old dices, 
Like politicians, wear old hats, 
And we will go to Hyde & Behman's picnic, 
January tenth on Harlem Flats. 
Ant—Sweet Bye and Bye. 
There's a 
barber shop run by an Irish Italian, 
And the chair he shaves you in is full of tacks, 
He'll cut your hair with an eight-day shovel. 
And shave you with a 
pen-knife or an axe. 
Ant—Scotch Lassie Jane. 
Oh, there lives a 
dizzy dame on the hills of Harlem Flats, 
She makes shirts and takes in scrubbing by the dozen; 
Her mother is a 
doctor, and her father carries the hod 
In a 
bank she says is owned by her first cousin. 
AIR—Bogle Man. 
Nix, nix, nix, the bartender he will drop, 
Don't you try to hang him up, or he will call a 
cop; 
Nix, nix, nix, don't try to shove the queer, 
Go and bathe your feet in mush or he'll slug you with a 
keg of beer. 
Ant—Full Moons. 
When the little bugs are creeping. 
In a 
ten-cent lodging house; 
There you'll find the bums a- sleeping, 
Just as quiet, quiet as a 
mouse.

Subelski's Daughter. 
Written and sung by DAVE Howaan. 
One evening lately I 
run out quickly 
To buy some fish for a 
Friday night; 
I 
went to Subelski's to buy some plunkeys, 
And what I 
saw there was a 
terrible sight. 
There was pike fish, pickerel, and plunkeys, 
And mackerel that had a 
terrible smell; 
A 
pound for two cents, three, or five cents, 
However they eat them I 
cannot tell. 
CHORUS. 
There's Subelski, the political speaker, 
In Tammany Hall, boys, he's got a 
pull 
I'll keep away from Subelski's fish store 
Friday noon, when the store is full. 
Subelski's daughter drinks Croton water, 
But she won't refuse a 
glass of beer; 
She is, like her father, a 
big wind bladder, 
And a 
crushed politician's beyond compare. 
He will run for Assembly or Congress 
On our coming election day; 
I'll put my vote in for Isaac Subelski, 
And he'll get elected to stay away. 
...There's Suoelski, 8ze.

POOR WHITE SLAVE. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
Am—Slavery Days. 
ToruNG slowly, day by day, 'till his life has pass'd away, 
And they give him scarcely room to lay his head; 
Ile drudges, morn and night, to earn his scanty bite; 
All his luxuries are water, scorn and bread. 
They never sing his praise ' cept on election days; 
And they often call him scoundrel, tramp or knave; 
All the world may keep him down with many a 
sullen frown— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
CHORUS. 
No matter where it be still he never can be free; 
The poor will ever have to stoop and crave. 
His coat is ragged, tore, let us kick him from the door— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
Great Beecher tells the poor they are well enough, he's sure, 
If they get but bread and water all the while. 
If ever there is a 
hell they'll chuck him in pell mell; 
He will surely get the _middle of the pile. 
We never look for joy, there's none for you or I; 
Still how our suffering hearts try to be brave; 
How it makes the tear-drops fall when they tell us after all 
We are nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc. 
Those with riches hold full sway for their millions gaineth day; 
It has been our valiant legislator's boast, 
The slaves may put me in, but I'm sure 'twill be no sin, 
r1'0 always work for those who pay the most; 
Yet, still we can forgive, 'tis only while we live, 
When this mortal life 
passing at the grave; 
Then we'll surely bless the day we so often heard them say 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
- , Isio matter where it be, etc.

LORD ARTHUR GOOSEBERRY INCOG, 
NITIO, 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN for CHAS VIVIAN, 
Music by DAVE BRAMAN.

came here 
I 
was christened right away. 
When I 
walk out I 
hear folks shout,

Hi, T

Don't let it slip, I'll give you the tip,

In Houston Street I 
had a 
treat 
At a 
place called Harry II111's; 
I'd a 
drop of beer with a 
chap so queer, 
Who wished me to foot the bills. 
'Twas then I 
became indignant, 
Said " I'm a 
Lord, sir. you must know!" 
I 
heard a 
shout throw Taffy out 
Incognitio 
I'm Lord Taffy, etc. 
At my hotel I'm treated well, 
Oh, in fact, quite royally; 
It's quite a 
lark—they're in the dark 
As to my nobility. 
So I 
register Lord, ah! with a 
biank, 
From London so and so, 
To hear them laugh and say it's Taff 
Incognitio! 
I'm Lord Taffy, etc.

Go take your shovel in your hand, 
Go out and work for me; 
Die or live they have nothing to give 
To a 
poor man's family. 
Give us, &e. 
They bring over their Italians 
And Chinamen from the South, 
Thinking they can do our work, 
Take the bread from out our mouths; 
The white man's children they must starve, 
Shure we will not agree 
To be put down like a 
worm in the ground, 
And starve our family. 
Give us, Jr,c.

Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the German you 
could'nt keep her still.

GLIDING UP THE STREAM. 
By ED. HARRIGAN. 
As sung by HARRIGAN & HART. 
(Air—" Gliding Down the Stream.") 
One year ago my Willie 
Gently took a 
sail, 
As far as Blackwell's Island, 
He couldn't find no bail; 
He'd been h'isting sour mashes, 
Till he got on too much steam, 
In a 
Bellevue ferry vessel, oh I 
He glided up the stream. 
CHOR1JS. 
Gliding up the stream, 
Oh I 
how the snoozers scream, 
With bums afloat on a 
Bellevue boat, 
It's a 
ten day dizzy dream; 
Gliding up the stream, 
To wear a 
suit of Jean, 
Oh I 
what a 
gawk, to leave New York, 
And go gliding up the stream. 
They put him in the baker's— 
My Willie pure as snow, 
And made him count the raisins, 
And stamp down all the dough; 
They cut his curly ringlets, 
Yes, shaved his head off clean, 
To make him look respectable, 
, After gliding up the stream. 
Gliding up, etc, 
When Will came from the prison, 
He floated in a 
tank, 
He landed in Astoria, 
On Long Island's grassy bank; 
He fell down on his benders, 
So bad his eye did gleam, 
Saying, " You'll never catch-ee me no more-ee, 
Gliding up the stream." 
Gliding up, etc.

Old Bacchus, you deluder, 
With all your coaxing ways, 
You've enslaved me liked a 
spider, 
When brought within my gaze; 
Wid whiskey I'm so frisky, 
From my head down to my toes, 
I'd praise you, oh my darling, 
To your friends or to your f

Sung in his new play, •` My Wife's 
Mother." 
Let every man from Paddy's Land, 
Sweet Cork, or Londonderry, 
Castlebar, or fair Armagh, 
Join hands and let us be merry. 
Far down or Tip, 
When potteen you sip, 
Plaze overflow your glasses, 
Let this be your toast, 
Old Ireland's beast, 
Our Bonnie Irish Lasses. 
CHORUS. 
The rosy cheek, 
The coal black eye, 
No girl on earth surpasses, 
The sweet colleen, 
From Erin green, 
Our bonnie Irish lasses. 
France and Italy, Scotland, too, 
Are famed for beauty rare; 
From Russia's snow, to Mexico, 
All have an equal share. 
Geographically, 
In history, 
Ancient or modern classes, 
Beauty's crown 
Was handed down 
For our bonnie Irish lasses. 
Soft and silky is their hair, 
Good natured as a 
dove, 
Ever true, the colleen rhu, 
'Twas she invented love. 
There's a 
story old, 
Of Adam bold, 
While dozing on the grasses, 
Good luck, says he, 
Where'er you be, 
You bonny Irish lasses. 
The rosy cheek, etc.

Music published by Wm. 
Pond, 547 Broadway, New York. 
I'm the lather of a 
family, 
Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly 
They are their mother's joy; 
It's every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop; 
Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
mat, cue, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
They talk about the Murphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Wont down to Coney Isle 
With a 
German music teacher, 
Who filled her with clam soup, 
Then they say, don't give it away, 
What you hear on our front stoop. 
You'd have to run the gauntlet, 
If ye were walking by, 
They'd have your family history 
In the twinkling of an eye. 
They'd turn you gently over, 
While they 
it there in a 
group, 
They'd give to you sweet Ballyhoo, 
While passing our front stoop. 
They send Kate with a 
pitcher, 
For Cincinnati boor; 
Then their conversation 
For a 
mile or two you' l 
hear, 
They talk about the babies, 
The whooping coughs and croup, 
When the moon's out in sight, they say good !
Iliad, 
And go home from our front stoop.

Put forth their welcome hand, 
To the poor of suffering Ireland, 
Time and time again; 
We thank you for our countrymen, 
And Donevan is our name.

From the Emerald Isle 
Across the Sea;

From a 
Noble Family. 
Our ancestors were Noble, 
In the days of King O'Neal 
They fought for Erin's freedom 
In a 
suit of Silver Mail! 
Its Royal blood flows in our veins, 
We're proud of that self-same— 
We introduce ourselves to you— 
Donevan is our name. 
We're the Donevans, 
Oh, Erin! lovely Erin! 
Bright Diamond of the Sea, 
We always sing your praises 
Wherever we may be; 
From the lovely banks of Shannon 
To America we came— 
To look around and settle down— 
And Donevan is our name.

Performed by HARRIGAN & HART. 
Whin we cime out from Cork, 
This day twelve months ago; 
We landed in New York, 
At the Battery here below.

On the freight that wint so slow; 
An' settled down a-farmin', 
In the State of Ohio, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's bothered we are really, 
We never have no rest, 
Since we met with Horace Greeley, 
And the day that we wint West. 
The divil a 
bite we ate 
Till we got to Chicago; 
Nor not a 
wink of slape, 
Oh, how could they trate us so? 
Then we rid upon the stages, 
All 'cross the prairie land; 
And left the State of Ohio, 
For the State of Michigan. 
Oh, it's bothered, eta 
We're tired out complate, 
Wid work and fat-i-gue; 
It's our frinds that we will seek, 
D'yees know thim, now, any of you? 
Sure we would like to find thim, 
If yees would interest 
Yerselves just for a 
moment, sure, 
We're strangers from the West.

My dear little Eileen is sweeter to me 
Than the ordorous flowers of the maythorn tree, 
She has hair golden fair, she has skin like a 
swan, 
Aud what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
My dear little Eileen has a 
heart full of love, 
And I 
scarce think of earth or of heaven above ; 
But the grace of her face from the night to the dawn. 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawl). 
I 
think she's an angel that dropped on the earth, 
With her soft sunny smiles and her sweet laugh of mirth; 
And I've oft thoughts of fear that she'll sometimes be gone, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And what shall I 
say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
I'll meet her next Sunday by fair Avondhu, 
When I'll ask her to love me and marry me, too; 
And rove in the grove till the twilight comes on, 
And that's what I'll say to my own Eileen Bawn, 
And that's what I'll say to my own Eileen Bawn. 
HARRIGAN'S DREAM, 
Dedicated to Messrs. HARRIGAN & HART, 
BY 
ROBElif MCKAY. 
The " Mulligan Guard" turned out in force 
In the " Patrick's-day Parade ;" 
The " Skidmores," too, were also there— 
A 
fine display they made. 
It was remarked by every one, 
As they " Down Broadway" did go. 
There were no finer men in all 
The " Regular Army, Oh." 
CHORUS. 
With banners flying, music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glatscing 
So they marched away. 
" 
The Ould Hat," blocked for fifty cents, 
Again gleamed 'mid the throng, 
And " McNamara," proud's a 
lord, 
Beneath it marched along; 
He heeded not the naughty boys; 
But, from a 
well-filled can, 
Drank frequent healths to Ireland, with 
" 
Muldoon. the Solid Man." 
CHOEVII. 
With banners flying, music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing 
So they marched away. 
Next came " The Gallant Sixty-Ninth"--
Sweet Kitty O'Neil, of course, 
Was there, and looked perfection, on 
A 
cream-complexioned horse; 
And oh, what shouts and joyful cries 
Were heard along the street, 
When, recognized by every one, 
Passed by " Old Uncle Pete." 
CHORUS. 
With banners flying, music playing 
Opera airs from Avenue A; 
Proud steeds prancing, bright eyes glancing. 
So they marched away. 
And then the seedy " Scandal Club," 
The gawks, devoid of guile; 
Passed by then the " N. E. F. C." 
In " Rale McMullin Style. 
And so they went; but then, of course:

The half of them, for I

kmerican Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is thetold. 
eat and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
ese Cards are arranged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each of these into K for King, Q for Queen, 
ad K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of ho U. S.

Courting Cards.— This Serieb of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a 
way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
riflemen  who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
) 
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in tits 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

The Greatest Trick Book of the Age.

PTY D11 MPTY, 
IT PLEASES BOTH OLD AND YOUNG, 
It is a Fac simile of a Trick practiced by all 
the Professors of Magic. 
It is arranged so systematically, and is accom-
panied with directions so plainly written., that, with 
a 
single perusal, any person may become an adept 
in an unfailing source of amusement. 
Read what a leading Journal says of it: 
" 
An ingenious little book of the thaumaturgic order 
has been sent us, called HIPMPTY DUMPTY,' and bound 
in such a 
way as to give opportunity for a 
decidedly 
puzzling trick. 
While presenting the ordinary appear-
ance of a 
child's picture-book, gayly printed and colored, 
it is so bound that a 
practiced manipulator, taking it 
up, and flirting the leaves rapidly over, can make it ap-
pear to be filled with copies of only one picture, or with 
blank pages, or with any one of quite a 
SUccession of 
figures. 
°One minute the pamphlet, quickly thumbed, 
appears to contain nothing but portraits of Harlequin, 
in his tesselated suit; the next, only Columbine ; then, 
nothing but Pantaloon, or Riding Hood, or Mephisto-
pheles. 
A little practice, and the directions printed 
with the book will make anybody at .home in the hand-
ling of it."—Phila. Evening Bulletin.
