. Introduction.
 
Community ethnic language and heritage s
chools are a dynamic national
 
phenomenon.
 Joshua Fishman (
1980) estimates that in the United States there
 
are 6,000 such s
chools attended by as many as 600,000 children.
 I
n every
 
region of the country a
dult members of various ethnic and religious groups have
 
organized s
chools.
 Support of these s
chools requires substantial effort and
 
dedication, a
nd surely i
ndicates a commitment by the adult generation to t
rans-
mit their cultural, religious, and linguistic heritage to their children.
 How-
ever, there a
re f
ew detailed descriptions or analyses of any group's efforts to
 
establish and maintain such an educational environment f
or i
ts children.
 The
 
Ethnic Heritage a
nd Language Schools Project, sponsored by The American Folklife
 
Center, L
ibrary of Congress, is an attempt to document this overlooked phenomen
 
by supporting f
ieldwork in twenty community schools representative of the cul-
tural diversity of America.
 Through a description of the h
istory, f
inancing
 
and a
dministration, curriculum, and personnel of The Islamic School of Seattle,
 
we can examine how one community is striving to provide for the i
ntellectual,
 
spiritual, emotional, a
nd physical needs of its children.
 
2
. Historical background.
 
From three f
amilies and a handful of unmarried s
tudents in the early
 
1960s, the Muslim community of Seattle has grown to between 7,000 and 9,000 in
 
the 1980s.
 In the past decade, the community has experienced i
ts greatest
 
growth, a
ccompanied by a dramatic i
ncrease i
n the number of its school-age
 
children.
 On February 3
,  1
980, a small group of Muslim women f
rom the Seattle
 
area met officially f
or the f
irst t
ime to f
ound a s
chool.
 Upon i
ncorporation
 
of the Islamic School of Seattle on February 214
, 1
980, these Muslim p
arents
 
and e
ducators became the Board of Directors.
 
The s
truggle of the children and their parents over the years to
 
maintain an Islamic life is mentioned repeatedly as having been the impetus
.
 
for the establishment of the Islamic School of Seattle.
 S
tressing "academic
 
excellence within a
n Islamic atmosphere", the School s
eeks "to lead the
 
young muslim a
nd help h
im to deal with life i
n Western society without the
 
slightest necessity for religious compromise."  On the one hand, "it is f
rom
 
a s
trong religious commitment that a system of lasting norms, values, and
 
morality emerges", and on the other, "family s
tability depends on shared
 
beliefs."  Yet, "a child cannot be totally s
ecure unless family a
nd social
 
environment complete each other.
 The Islamic School of Seattle strives to
 
f
ill the gap in s
ocial environment which a public s
ecular s
chool can never
 
f
ill."  The a
ims of such an Islamic e
ducation are a
rticulated clearly i
n
 
"The  Parent
 Handbook," a twelve-page booklet written by the Muslim a
dmin-
istrators and distributed to the School's f
amilies.
 These "School Goals"
 
a
re, namely:
 
S
 
-1-
-2-
1
.  To p
rovide our children with an atmosphere, as close to
 
the Islamic i
deal as possible, in which they can grow and learn as
 
whole individuals, intellectually, spiritually, and physically.
 
2
.  To s
trengthen them to meet and to effectively deal with
 
the challenges of living in the modern American society.
 
3
. To i
nstill  in them a pride in their heritage by enabling
 
them to approach knowledge from a Muslim point of view and by pre-
senting a balanced education with as much emphasis on the Muslim
 
world as on the west.
 
4
. To offer the ultimate in academic excellence so that our
 
children a
re prepared to take an active and dominant role in the
 
world i
n which they live.
 
5
.  To f
oster lasting f
raternal bonds with their Muslim c
lass-
mates.
 
6
.  To enable them to master the Arabic language so that they
 
may have ready access to the original  sources of Islamic knowledge.
 
The pilot project, a modified Montessori preschool and kindergarten
 
"which would provide excellent teaching in an Islamic atmosphere", opened
 
September 2,  1980.
 During its first year, the Islamic School of Seattle
 
shared facilities with the Islamic Center of Seattle, both occupying a house
 
owned by the Center in the city's south end (4919 3
1st Ave.S.,  Seattle, WA
 
98108).
 Children between the ages of 2-1/2 and 5 were recruited by the
 
School's founders "telephoning every Muslim family in Seattle having children in
 
that age range, telling them about the new school, and urging them to enroll
 
their children," Ann El-Moslimany advised.
 For Sr. Ann,
 a parent of three
 
teen-age children, and the other founders this strategy was uncomplicated:
 "we
 
knew all the families in that category," besides, "mothers of Muslim children
 
know our children need the support of Muslim peers and Muslim education" to keep
 
them from being pulled in two directions.
 The success of this initial, lin
 
offering provided encouragement and enthusiasm for acquiring an appropriate
 
facility in order to expand and extend the program to the upper grades.
 
During the spring of 1981 serious consideration focused on the pros and
 
cons of building a school at a new site or buying an existing, older building.
 
Finally, a solidly built, two-story schoolhouse in Seattle's central area was
 
located.
 Originally built and occupied by the Hebrew Academy in 1930,  it had
 
been leased to the city during the 1960s as a public education and youth serv-
ices facility.
 Standing empty during the 1970s, however, this architecturally
 
impressive building at 720 25th Ave., between Cherry and Columbia, had been
 
frequently vandalized and was in sad disrepair when Seattle Muslims purchased
 
it for $350,000.
 "I was in Kuwait when they called me about finding the build-
ing," Sr. Ann reflected.
 "It was a lot of money, all in cash, and due in three
 
weeks.
 I was asked if I thought I could raise the money.
 I didn't know, but
 
upon talking with a family friend who knew more about these things than I did,
 
it was agreed that I should try.
 I telephoned back the decision, the deposit
 
of $50,000 was made, and we raised what we needed, although it was closer to
 
six weeks by the time all the money was raised and the paperwork done."

Before opening for the  1981-82 academic year, the lovely red tile roof
 
was repaired,  two classrooms on the first-floor were renewed with bright paint
 
and new flooring,  and all necessary changes to comply with city and state codes
 
of health and safety were made.
 The major structural requirements were accomp-
lished by hiring contractors,  some of whom were themselves members of the Muslim
 
community, while other necessary work was accomplished by volunteers recruited
 
from among parents, students, and the Muslim community as a whole.
 In the
 
winter, after school had already opened, a third, larger room was renovated for
 
the preschoolers by yet another group of volunteers.
 As funds and resources
 
have become available, repairs and renovations have been scheduled:
 a new
 
gymnasium floor; a remodelled women and young children's lavatory; a rebuilt
 
front stairway; a fresh coat of paint on the building's exterior window sash
 
and foundation.
 Additionally,  skills and equipment have been donated by other
 
community members.
 Jamshid Kavoussi, an artist, handpainted,  in graceful Arabic
 
script, verses from the Qur' an at child's eye level along the building's main
 
hallway and the name "Islamic School of Seattle",  in English and Arabic, on the
 
building's facade,  above the entrance door â€¢
 Diana Akghar, the School's Adminis-
trative Secretary, recalled "another brother, who is in the salvage business,
 
donated dozens of school desks just at the moment when we were planning to pur-
chase some."
 
In December,  1981,  the Washington State Board of Education granted full
 
"state approval"  to the preschool and elementary programs offered by the Islamic
 
School of Seattle.
 In other words, the School was determined to have met "all
 
fire, health, and safety codes,"  and was providing "qualified teachers for its
 
programs."
 At the close of the  1981-82 school year, more than fifty children
 
between the ages of 2-1/2 and 12 were enrolled in the preschool, kindergarten,
 
and grade school programs under the direction of certified teachers assisted
 
by full-time Muslim teaching assistants, Arabic instructors, and volunteers from
 
the Seattle Muslim community.
 
3
. Economic and administrative considerations.
 
Although the Islamic School of Seattle was founded by a small group of
 
Muslim parents and educators from the Seattle area,  support for the purchase and
 
continuing renovation and operation of the School has come from members of the
 
Muslim community throughout the United States and abroad, especially from "the
 
good Muslim men and women" of Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.
 The Arabic word
 
zakat, which literally means "purification," has no actual and precise English
 
equivalent, being most appropriately understood as "poor-due".
 Zakat, the
 
fourth of the acts of worship in Islam,* is thus "the Muslim's worship of God
 
by means of his wealth through an obligatory* form of giving to those in need."
 
Zakat funds may also be spent "in the cause of God, e.g.,  for the construction
 
of mosques, religious schools and hospitals, and for the salaries of those in-
volved in the propagation or study of Islam whose work keeps them from having
 
time to earn a livelihood."
 
Besides the payment of the obligatory zakat,  Islam also urges Muslims to
 
give voluntary charity, to the extent they can afford, to those in need.
 Indeed
 
charitableness is among the most stressed qualities in Islam, because "a Muslim
 
is supposed to be always responsive to human need and distress, and to regard
 
his wealth as a trust from God which is to be used not only for himself and his
 
family but for other human beings in need as well."
 This proper Muslim attitude
 
is clearly set out in the Qur'an, that is:
 
-4-
You will not attain righteousness until you spend out of that
 
which you love.
 And whatever you spend from (
your)  possessions,  indeed
 
God is aware of it.  (
3:92)
 
They ask thee  (Muhammad)  what they should spend.
 Say:  "What
 
is beyond your needs."
 (
2:219)
 
Consequently,  donating to the Islamic School of Seattle must be understood, not
 
as the largess of wealthy individuals, but as an integral act of worship re-
quired of all Muslims in the practice of their faith,  Islam.*
 Sr.  Jodi,  for ex-
ample, wants to designate her family's Zakat al_Fitr*
 to the School.
 She and
 
her husband are students at the University and they have a small daughter who,
 
Insh' allah, will attend the preschool in September,  1982.
 Like most student
 
couples raising a family as well as going to university,  financial constraints
 
are very real.
 Nonetheless,  Sr. Jodi assumes her responsibility as a Muslim and
 
appropriately designates her zakat to the Islamic School.
 
A second and equally important understanding, all Muslims are responsi-
ble for obtaining the knowledge that Allah "has directed us to live":
 "Islam is
 
a complete code of life and it is obligatory for each muslim to seek knowledge
 
of the basic tenets of Islam related to all aspects of individual and social
 
life.
 Muslim children in the U.S.A. are in the hands of their parents and the
 
Islamic community, and it becomes an obligation to educate muslim children in
 
the path of Islam."
 When "the Seattle muslim community is unable to take on
 
this responsibility alone,"  it is Islamically correct to call upon the worldwide
 
Muslim community for assistance.
 But, we would be wrong to interpret such an
 
appeal for assistance as having only monetary aims.
 Husein Saleh, the Arabic
 
teacher in the K-6 program, responded to his obligation:
 "I am not trained in
 
teaching Arabic.
 My wife is a linguist and she has helped me prepare many of
 
the materials.
 My training and interest is in many fields, for example,  I have
 
my Masters in Urban Planning.
 But,  it is my obligation to teach Arabic.
 Each
 
day I ask if they have found another teacher.
 How can I not teach the students
 
Arabic?
 It is our language of our religion.
 It is my duty."
 
With the above in mind, the economic and administrative specifics are
 
treated in the following short, largely descriptive responses to the outline
 
questions .*
 
3
.1 To meet i
ts f
inancial obligations, the Islamic School of Seattle has
 
sought donations f
rom Muslim i
ndividuals and organizations; issued appeals for
 
specific needs at community gatherings; encouraged i
nterested i
ndividuals and
 
groups t
o p
lan fund-raising activities benefitting the School; charged i
ts stu-
dents tuition; i
nitiated educational projects which will provide i
ncome f
or the
 
School fund; and begun planning f
or an endowment fund to ensure the f
inancial
 
well-being and continuation of the School.  In addition to monetary donations,
 
offers of necessary supplies and volunteer labor f
rom Muslim parents, students,
 
and community members have f
requently been responsible f
or "stretching" even
 
further what had been received.  A "community-wide effort was put f
orth to
 
shape up the new school buidling f
or the f
irst day of class" last September,
 
while a s
imilar effort r
eadied the new preschool room f
or i
ts February openin
 
Moreover, "time and t
ime again members of the community have come to our a
id"
 
donating i
tems we need, and "twice our needs have been met even before we
 
asked!  On the very day that we had to place an order f

chairs for the classroom,  Brother Sami Amin, who deals in salvage,  called to
 
tell us he. had 200 to donate.
 On another occasion we decided to announce at
 
Juma'  Prayer service that we needed tricycles and other riding toys.
 Before the
 
announcement was made we were presented with several such toys from a family who
 
was moving.
 Allah is the knower of all thi ng s!I *

.2  The full-time members of the instructional, administrative, and cus-
todial staff of the Islamic School of Seattle are compensated for their serv-
ices.
 The faculty are paid monthly according to the following salary schedule:
 
Director of Elementary,  $1111; Director of Preschool,  $700;  K-i Teacher, $700;
 
Teaching Assistants and Arabic Teachers, $4.75 per hour.
 The teaching staff is
 
augmented by volunteers from the Seattle Muslim community.
 For example,  Samia
 
El-Moslixnany, a college student and daughter of Sr. Ann, has been teaching
 
Islamic art and music classes in the elementary program, while Sr. Jodi has
 
recently begun assisting with reading and spelling reviews in the K-i class.
 
Before her marriage and subsequent move to Indiana last Fall, Zainab Ubaidullah,
 
a member of the Board of Directors and its "Perpetual President", had taught
 
religion to the elementary students.
 Currently, the administrative or office
 
personnel staff includes two positions.
 Diana Akhgar was hired in December to
 
take charge of the day-to-day, on-site needs of the School as its Administrative
 
Secretary.
 Since the Islamic School of Seattle opened two years ago,  Irene
 
Junejo has been driving the School's econoline van.
 As the Parents' Bus
 
Driver,  she is employed directly by a group of parents to provide transporta-
tion for their children along an established route.
 Additionally,  Sr.  Irene
 
drives the van on school fieldtrips (e.g.,  in May when the preschoolers enjoyed
 
a hayride at Aqua Barn & School)  and provides transportation for the women in
 
the School's new "Women's English Program".
 The custodial or service personnel
 
staff has three employees.
 Mohamath Toulas,  father of two of the older elemen-
tary school children,  is the School's Custodian; Mohammad Javaharian and Yaghoub
 
Ebrahimi occupy small, remodeled rooms in the School's basement in exchange for
 
each carrying out the responsibilities of a Night Watchman.
 
The significance of the employment of these individuals is not missed.
 
Indeed,  it was highlighted in a recent fund-raising "news update":
 "An impor-
tant spin-off of the school has been the jobs which we have been able to provide
 
to muslims from within the Seattle community."
 At the time of that newsletter,
 
Muslim employees included  "two pre-school teachers, one elementary teacher's
 
aid, one Arabic teacher, one secretary, one director of our Women's English
 
Program, one school bus driver, and one custodian."
 Two groups represented in
 
this listing are particularly susceptible to employment problems:
 "Muslim
 
women who find it necessary to work  . . .
 are now spared the difficulties of work-
ing in a non-Islamic environment", and members of political refugee groups who
 
have limited knowledge of English and of American society and culture, yet the
 
need to support their families, can work within a more "supportive and familiar
 
environment . 1

.3  During the 1981-82 academic year a $15 non-refundable registration  
fee was charged "to cover the time and paperwork of registration".
 Tuition was
 
collected from all children enrolled in each of the ten-week instructional quar-
ters according to the following formula:

Daycare was also available for each child staying at the School from 7:0O-8:45am
 
or from 3:15-4:30pm at a cost of $1.00 per hour.
 Payments of tuition were re-
quired in full by the end of the third week of any quarter, although deferred
 
payment contracts were available.
 Families with financial hardship have been
 
eligible for partial tuition reductions through funds from the "scholarship
 
fund", a limited resource itself dependent upon donations designated for this
 
purpose.
 While it was hoped that tuition would be able to cover the salaries of
 
the instructional staff (excluding medical insurance payments),  in actuality,
 
such revenue rarely covered more than one-third of that obligation in  1
981-82.
 
3.4 The School currently provides all textbooks used by the children,
 
while the children's families are responsible for the purchase of those work-
books or "consumables" used in support of classroom instruction. 
For exampi-
early in the school year Sr. Ann,  in her capacity as Acting Administrator, w
 
to all the School's parents:
 "We are ready to start our pre-reading program
 
which involves the use of books which the children will keep.
 There will be a
 
charge of
  for the books which your child is using.
 Please send or bring
 
in this amount as soon as possible."
 
3
.5 Apparently, participation by the Islamic School of Seattle in the
 
federally-subsidized School Lunch Program was considered.
 However, the amount
 
of staff time and effort, as well as the presumed difficulty that would be en-
countered in communicating with many of the non-American parents, seemed to be
 
greater than the anticipated benefit to the very, very small number of children
 
who might, in the end, be determined eligible.
 The School has appealed to the
 
Educational Missions of several Middle Eastern and Gulf countries for Arabic-
language teaching, religious, and library materials.
 Subsequently,  some of the
 
items received have been used during regular classroom instruction, particularly
 
in the religion and the Arabic-for-Arabic speakers classes.
 
3
.6 In the past,  subsidies have been provided by the two other local
  
Muslim organizations: 
the Islamic Center of Seattle, and the Muslim Students'
 
Association, University of Washington Chapter.
 The Center provided the School's
 
first "home" in  1980-81 and substantial loans* when the present building was
 
purchased in March,  1981.
 Currently, the Vice-President of the Officers of
 
the Corporation (or, simply, The School Board)  and a parent of a daughter en-
rolled in the Preschool, Faizullah Kakar, is also serving as the Center's Presi-
dent.
 Recently, the Center held a "summer camp benefit" in the gymnasium of the
 
School; now, plans are underway to hold religious "Sunday School" classes in the
 
building's classrooms, which are more suitable for such activities than are the
 
facilities of the community's mosque where the Center has its own headquarters.
 
In September just as the School was opening in its own new building, the local
 
branch of the Muslim Students' Association* contributed $9000 to the School's
 
scholarship fund.
 The School Board designated that this contribution would pro-
vide partial scholarships  (
i.e.,  up to one-half the cost of tuition for any one
 
child during an academic year).
 In this way,  the limited resources would go
 
further,  and the families and children "would appreciate and value the education
 
they had to pay for."

ith additional  resources a trained,  full-time school administrator
 
could be hired; additional grades could be added, extending the present program
 
through high school; an endowment fund would be possible,  facilitating long-term
 
financial planning;  scholarship assistance could be offered to a larger number
 
of children; and further restoration and renovation projects would be planned
 
for the school building and grounds.
 And although the above points are separ-
ately enumerated,  it is more profitable to consider them together, as a whole.
 
The Muslim men and women who are responsible for the well-being of the Islamic
 
School are the first to acknowledge that none of them has training in education
 
or school administration.
 Therefore, the securing of an individual with this
 
expertise, an individual who also shares their Islamic faith, has received sup-
port from the beginning.
 The employment of such an administrator is considered
 
essential  if the School's program is to continue to develop and to secure the
 
support necessary in meeting the needs of the community's children and their
 
families.
 Moreover, released from many of the day-to-day chores and demands in-
volved in running a School, The School Board would then have the time for long-
range planning, policy consideration, and other concerns and projects directly
 
related to the continued growth and development of the educational program.
 
3
.8 At present, the Administrative Secretary and The School Board are
 
functioning as the administrators of the School.
 For example, decisions about
 
the misbehavior of a child, the taking of class photographs, the work of a par-
ticular contractor, etc., are all considered by the Board during its weekly
 
meetings.
 However, many typical day-to-day problems often can be handled more
 
efficiently at the time they occur.
 Likewise, postponement of a decision in an
 
emergency or otherwise urgent situation is frequently impractical, even if it
 
were possible.
 Daily concerns that can safely wait until the weekly meeting
 
may effectively crowd out those that are less immediate, however.
 Time that
 
might have been spent in profitable discussion of a long-range goal,  such as
 
the securing of contributions to establish an endowment fund, can easily be
 
diverted to hearing about an isolated classroom incident involving one or two
 
children.
 Certainly, behavior in the classroom is important, but discipline is
 
more likely to have a lasting affect on the child if handled at the time by the
 
appropriately designated teacher or administrator.
 Moreover, without an indi-
vidual at the School on a daily basis with the authority to make decisions and
 
carry out policy there is considerable latitude for administrative confusion an
 
breakdowns in communication between and among the various constituent groups:
 
teachers, staff, parents, children, community members.
 An administrator having
 
authority, yet responsive and accountable to The School Board, would handle the
 
necessary daily operations of the School while speaking with one administrative
 
voice.
 
3
.9 Meetings of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) are scheduled for
 
one Saturday aferterrioon a month and held at the School.
 Children bring home
 
announcements of these meetings and parents are encouraged "to attend to get to
 
know the other parents and your children's teachers".
 Agenda items for the
 
January 30,  1982, meeting included:
 transportation; the new Arabic teacher; the
 
new elementary school teacher; the new preschool directoress and room; the
 
School's recent accreditation; up-coming P.T.A. elections; and fund-raising.
 
During the school year the PTA's Parents Committee held a series of rummage
 
sales raising more than $1,000 toward the purchase of playground equipment.
 
Participation by parents has been estimated at approximately 1
0-15%,  a level
 
which is viewed as being comparable to that achieved by other similar groups.
 
However, with a student population of under fifty, and the total number of
 
families less than that figure, even a substantially higher participatory level
 
would not produce more than a handful of active members.
 Moreover,  since many
 
-8-
of the School's families come from non-Western countries and they are often un-
comfortable speaking English, the involvement in their children's education and
 
the participatory role expected of them as parents is still unfamiliar.
 None-
theless, parental  involvement is emphasized:
 "We believe a child's learning ex-
perience is complete when the school and home make a cooperative effort.
 The
 
school and the home are extensions of one another; our interests are the same,
 
so our actions need be also."
 Meetings of the Schoci's PTA are chaired by a
 
President elected by the parents.
 Other "key positions"  include Secretary,
 
Treasurer,  Publications Officer,  and Bazaar Chairperson.
 Finally,  involvement
 
in their children's school is stressed in the "Parent Handbook"  as "a responsi-
bility and an opportunity to contribute in a positive way to the future of your
 
children and your community."
 
3
.10 The administration and goverance of the School  is handled by two
 
separate, but related,  entities:
 The Board of Directors and The Officers of the
 
Corporation. 
On the one hand,  "because of the commitment of the founding board
 
members concerning the use of (the)  funds"  raised from members of the Muslim
 
comxnmunity throughout the United States and abroad, especially from Kuwait,
 
Saudi Arabia, and Qatar",  these  "Muslim parents and educators from the Seattle
 
area"  remain the  "perpetual overseers of the assets of the school" as its Board
 
of Directors.
 Since February,  1980,  four Muslim women have been members:  Zainab
 
Ubaidullab, Ann El-Moslimany,  Rafia Khokhar,  and Suzette Kakar.
 On the other
 
hand,  "because the school desires to be responsive to the community it serves,
 
an adm inistrative board is selected from interested community members."  Under
 
the title officers of the Corporation (or,  simply,  the School Board),  it meets
 
"on a weekly basis to establish future policies and priorities as well as to
 
address day-to-day problems."
 It is this Board which is ultimately in charge of
 
all personnel, curriculum, budget,  and building plans.
 Consultation with the
 
School's teaching staff is invited on a monthly basis, while "other individuals
 
are consulted as needed to utilize their expertise in aspects of fund-raising,
 
curriculum,  etc."
 Currently,  six individuals are serving as Officers of the
 
Corporation:
 Abdul-Raouf Mannaa,  President  (2/82);  Faizullab Kakar, Vice-Presi-
dent (
2/82);  Suzette Kakar,  Secretary (2/82);  Ann El-Moslimariy,  Fund-Raising

 The position of Treasurer,  formerly occupied by Abdalla Shamia,  is
 
vacant, and the associated duties are being handled by the Board as a whole.
 
According to Sr.  Diana,  "Finding someone with the time and expertise is not
 
always easy.
 A person who will be good with figures is one who has his own
 
business.
 But he is usually too busy with that, or else working on his Ph.D.!"
 
4. Curriculum.
 
The Islamic School of Seattle is authorized by the State of Washington
 
to offer a complete educational program for children preschool through elemen-
tary-school age.
 During the  1980-81 academic year,  the School offered a com-
bined preschool-kindergarten for children between the ages of 2-1/2 and 5.
 Upon
 
relocating to its own larger, more suitable facility in September,  1
981,  the
 
School was able to enroll older children as well.
 In December,  1981,  two qual-
ified teachers joined the teaching staff to head and teach in the preschool and
 
elementary programs; in April,  1
982,  a third teacher was hired to take charge of
 
the K-i class.
 By the close of the  1981-82 academic year in June, nearly fifty
 
children between the ages of 2-1/2 and 12 were enrolled in the preschool and
 
elementary programs meeting from 9:00am -
 3
:15pm da ily.*

.1 Classes are arranged according to the chronological age of the  
children: Preschool, 2Â½-5; Kindergarten and First, 6-7; and Second through
 
Sixth, 8-12.
 Within this chronological system, however, at least three other  
criteria are used in forming instructional groups:
 ability and readiness; 
-
 
sex; and language background. Using assistant teachers and volunteers, small
 
groups within each of the three classes are formed to provide individual at-
tention for children at different grade and ability levels.  For example,
 
while one group of "pre-readers" worked with Sr. Azhar, Sr. Unimil was able to
 
use flashcards with another small group in vocabulary building.
 In the ele-
mentary program Sr. Mary regularly worked with one reading group while the
 
teachers provided review or new materials to the rest of the class.  With
 
volunteers from the local Muslim community such as Sr. Jodi, additional in-
dividualized instruction is possible.
 In the Preschool Br. Muhammad Nassir
 
Jappee frequently worked with the young boys on their Arabic while Sr. Azhar
 
helped the young girls wash and prepare for the group's morning snack.  When
 
the girls returned, the boys took their turn with Sr. Azhar,  the girls with
 
Br. Muhammad.
 In the Elementary program Br. Husein Saleh teaches Arabic to
 
the children who are "speakers of English" while the classroom teacher works
 
with the "speakers of Arabic" on their English reading and writing.  At the
 
end of the allotted time, usually forty-five minutes to an hour, the children
 
"switch". *  
4.2 The Preschool curriculum includes the following subjects: Arabic,
 
primarily vocabulary building; pre-reading and pre-mathematics, sometimes using
 
Montessori equipment; physical activity, organized games and "free play" in the
 
gymnasium or outside; religion, memorization of Qur'anic verses and discussion
 
of Islamic manners or stories of the Prophets.
 The preschoolers regularly par-
ticipate in the daily requirements of their faith:
 the teachers instruct, help,
 
and show through example the children "to make wudu"  (
i.e., wash for prayer)
 
properly in preparation for salat  (
i.e., prayer or worship).  While the children
 
usually have salat in their own classroom, they are often taken to the gymnasium
 
to participate along with the older children, staff and faculty members, women
 
enrolled in the Women's English Program, and Muslim visitors to the School.
 
In the Kindergarten and Grade School curriculum the following subjects are taught:
 
Arabic--reading, writing, conversation; mathematics;  science; English--reading
 
(
including phonics), writing, conversation; religion; Islamic art and music;
 
social studies from an Islamic viewpoint; and spelling.  Not all of these sub-
jects are taught every day.  For example, during the final quarter Mrs. Crum's
 
class, the 2nd-6th graders, had Islamic art with Sr. Samia on Wednesday after-
noons, travelled to the library with Mrs. Crum Tuesday afternoons, and Sr. Samia
 
met with them for Islamic music Thursday afternoons.  The Kindergarten-First
 
taught by Mrs. Carol Thorne had a similar schedule:
 Sr. Mary Abdi had social
 
studies with an Islamic view point for them Wednesday afternoons; Thursday after-
noons Mrs. Thorne taught handwriting.  During the day's schedule the children
 
also have regular periods for religious activity:
 the day opens with the reci-
tation of the Fatiha; time is devoted to memorizing Qur'anic verses, reciting
 
them individually and as a group; the afternoon includes wudu and salat, often
 
with one of the older boys serving as the imam  (
i.e.,  leader of the service).
 
4
.3 The time scheduled for each subject, or group of subjects, varies. 
For example, the daily religion class in the K-1 is one-half hour, while in the
 
2nd-6th religion class lasts twenty minutes each day.  Wudu and salat add another
 
forty minutes to the time in the afternoon set aside for Islamic practices.  Gen-
erally, the time periods in the elementary program range from thirty to severity-
five minutes.  Arabic instruction from Br. Husein is at least thirty-five minutes
 
-10-
of each school day, excluding the time spent on the language as part of the daily
 
religion class, salat, Fatiha, and surah recitation.  Moreover, during the 1981-82
 
school year the scheduling of subjects changed to reflect alterations in teaching
 
staff and volunteers; availability of audio-visual materials and equipment; and
 
concerns raised by Muslim parents or members of the School Board and the non-
Muslim certified teachers.  Examples of "typical" or anticipated scheduling of
 
the school day are included, along with those for the elementary classes and all
 
of the teachers for the final quarter, approximately end of April to the close
 
of classes on June 11,  1982.
 
4
.4 Textbooks, workbooks, audio-visual materials,  library books, and other  
teaching aids prepared by the individual teachers have been utilized in the academic
 
program.
 Textbooks are provided by the School, although the children are required
 
to purchase their own workbooks.  Earlier in the year instruction in Arabic was
 
regularly provided through "If
 tah Ya Sem Sem", an Arabic-version of the popular
 
children's program "Sesame Street."  Produced in Kuwait,  "If
 tah Ya Sem Sem," or
 
"Open Sesame", for a time "opened the door to Arabic" for the preschoolers, while
 
making the Arabic-speaking children "feel a bit more at home, since the program
 
had familiar sights, sounds, people".  When Mrs. Crum joined the teaching staff
 
as Director of the Elementary Program and a teacher in the K-6th grade  (
later,
 
2nd-6th grades)  she initiated the weekly walks to the public branch library just
 
a few blocks from the School.  A bookmobile regularly visits the School for the
 
Director of the Preschool, Sr. Ummil Khair Ishfaaq, to select books appropriate
 
for her children.  All of the teachers rely on "hand-outs" to re-enforce the r
 
lessons.  For example, Br. Husein prepared sheets with pictures of familiar
 
animals and objects, followed by its name in Arabic,  leaving a space for the
 
children to practice writing the correct identification.
 Sr. Mary found that
 
the children in the K-lst class better remembered and understood the topic of
 
a religion class when she included a supporting exercise, such as a worksheet to
 
complete, or an assignment to "draw and color what we had been talking about".
 
Several of these sheets were collected together in a religious booklet, it also
 
having been made by the children as part of a religion class project.  Mrs.
 
Crum and Mrs. Thorne relied on similar handouts, as well as on colored construction
 
paper, recycled computer print-outs, and assorted materials to encourage the
 
children and to stimulate their minds.  With limited resources, the teachers as
 
well as the children have had to be creative.
 In the Preschool, Sr. U
rnmil has
 
introduced the children to "manipulatives" associated with the Montessori-method
 
of instruction, encouraged the children to explore the objects in the classroom,
 
and played with the children "word bingo" to increase vocabulary skills.
 
4
.5 The curriculum materials come from the following sources: (
1)  those
 
from major publishers in the United States, e.g., the social studies texts are
 
published by McMillan in the series Places Near and Far; (
2)  those donated by
  
other Muslim countries through official government or educational sources, e.g., the
 
Saudi Arabian Educational Mission to the U.S.A. contributed Arabic-language
 
textbooks;  (
3) those developed, published, and distributed by Muslims through
  
their own publishing concerns, bookstores, and organizations, e.g., The Islamic
 
Foundation in Leicester, England, and its "The Muslim Children's Library", a series
 
of small well-produced books to help a Muslim child to "develop a fresh faith, a
 
dynamic commitment, a strong identity, and a throbbing yeÃ ring and urge to struggle--
all rooted in Islam".  Muslim Nursey Rhymes, Assalamu Alaikum (
Peace Be With You),
 
and several others from the series are in use in the Preschool.
 
4.6 Currently, the curriculum is established and supervised by the six -
member School Board of the Islamic School of Seattle.
 In the future, certified
 
-11-
S
 
S
 
teachers and trained educator-administrators who have accepted Islam could be
 
given more authority, might be depended upon more heavily, in the development,
 
implementation, and supervision of the School's curriculum.
 However, without
 
such trained Muslim personnel these tasks have been the responsibility of the
 
Board.
 To help, the Board has sought advice from the non-Muslim certified
 
teachers and other educators; has examined curriculum libraries in this country
 
and abroad; and has considered undertaking publishing the necessary materials
 
itself.
 The first book, tentatively expected to be available in October, 1982,
 
will be a "first-reading book, a combination workbook and reader" for elementary-
school children who are not native-speakers of Arabic, although this book and
 
the others planned for the series could also be used profitably, the Board ex-
pects, with teaching Arabic to young, native-speakers of the language.
 Once this
 
project is successfully underway, at least one Board member would like to see
 
the publishing venture expand to include other areas, for example, social studies
 
texts.
 In emphasizing the need for such publications, Sr. Ann El-Moslimany
 
emphasized:
 "Maybe 30% of the countries the children will be studying are
 
Muslim countries, and they are always presented badly, always.
 I
've never, ever,
 
ever looked at a textbook that presented a Muslim country in a way that I felt
 
was fair."  And how could social studies lessons that were "fair" be incorporated
 
into Arabic readers, for example.  Again Sr. Ann:
 "We feel that we could use
 
characters, especially that the children in our School--or our schools, there are
 
other Islamic schools in the US--would identify with.  Children who have, maybe
 
Pakistani origin, who go back to visit Pakistan and this is a good place to show
 
what these children would see in Pakistan, what ways they would see that are di: -
 
ferent from what they do in the US, and we could do it with the various nationa  -
 
ities, just have a few of these children as the characters in the book."  In ad-
dition to providing books for their and other Islamic schools--books of the
 
"Western- style", books incorporating illustration and other stimulating and inter-
esting techniques of presentation of curriculum materials typical in American
 
texts--the venture should return money from the profits directly to the School
 
fund.
 
4.7 The children are tested and graded on a regular basis. The school
 
year is divided into four quarters or reporting periods.  At the end of each
 
period report cards are distributed to the parents at a scheduled parent-teacher
 
conference.  Each "card" is actually an 8Â½x14, five-page pressure-sensitive form,
 
allowing a quarterly as well as a permanent record of academic development (
i.e.,
 
reading, language arts, spelling, handwriting, mathematics, social studies, science,
 
Arabic language, religion, art and music) and personal development (
e.g., listens
 
attentively, follows directions, shows respect for authority, works independently,
 
etc.) of each child.  An evaluation of "effort" by the child is also possible
 
since a teacher has space under each academic subject to indicate how she or he
 
"compares your child's effort to his or her own ability", whereas "achievement
 
grade" will compare "your child's achievement with other students at this grade
 
level".  The "key" or ranking procedure is the same for both effort and achieve-
ment:
 1
, Good;  2
, Satisfactory;  3, Needs improvement.  At the bottom of the
 
grade form are spaces for comments by the teachers at the end of each marking
 
period and a place to indicate promotion or grade assignment.  Each teacher who
 
works with the child fills in the appropriate items and gives his or her evalu-
ation of the child's work that quarter.  Moreover, parents and teachers are en-
couraged to "request a conference at any time during the year," and an effort
 
is made to have needed interpreters present whenever a language problem might
 
arise.  For example, Mrs. Crum asked Br. Husein to participate in a conference
 
about one of the children when she believed that his presence as a teacher and
 
-12-
an Arabic-speaker would be in the child's,  and his family's, best interest.
 
4
.8 The founders and officers of The Islamic School of Seattle have
 
sought to provide an "Islamic environment" for their community's school-age
 
children, not a school for Muslim children where "all of their subjects, ex -
cept religion, were divorced" from their Islamic faith.  According to Sr. A
l
 
"It's not that we are trying to pretend that the non-Islamic world doesn't
 
exist, but we'd also like to show our kids that Islam is everywhere.  And to
 
let it  (
Islam) pervade every aspect of what they are studying."  Consequently,
 
it is this emphasis on an "Islamic atmosphere" that distinguishes the Islamic
 
School of Seattle rather than the teaching of "unusual" or religious subjects.
 
Islamic religion and Arabic classes are part of the curriculum at every level,
 
"so each child will develop knowledge in these areas along with the basic
 
studies of reading, writing, and arithmetic."  Formal classes in Qur'an, Islamic
 
studies, and Classical Arabic are required of all students in Kindergarten and
 
Grade School.  During school hours, all children are required to participate in
 
salat, taking their places among peers and teachers.  Moreover,  it is expected
 
that:
 
â€¢
 the standards of Islamic behavior  (will) be followed in
 
the school and reinforced at home (
emphasis in original).  Modesty
 
and cleanliness are Islamic virtues, and all children will be ex-
pected to come to school appropriately dressed and groomed.
 
Discipline at the Islamic School of Seattle is geared towards pro-
moting an Islamic atmosphere of well-being and towards training the
 
children to become compassionate and cooperative members of our
 
society.
 Our simple rules are made to encourage each child to carry
 
out his or her duties to Allah, teachers, classmates, and self, as
 
well as to ensure basic health and safety.
 
Finally, parents seeking admission for their children are reminded in "The
 
Parent Handbook" that at The Islamic School of Seattle:
 "Education is pro-
vided within an Islamic framework, and parents should bear in mind that Islam
 
is not only a part of the curriculum, but it is the essence of the school's
 
being."
 
4
.9 Clearly, no one subject or disciplinary orientation "dominates" the
 
curriculum.  Rather, it is the commitment to Islam as a total way of life that
 
provides the framework for the development of a "specialized education program"
 
designed to meet all the children's needs--physical, emotional, educational,
 
spiritual.
 
4.10 Not surprisingly, there are differences of opinion as to the im-
portance of specific subject matter and on the amount of time given to dif-
ferent subjects. For example,
 there has been discussion of extending the
 
schoolday for the older children beginning in 1982-83 "to afford more time
 
for those subjects that we consider most important," according to Sr. Ann.
 
Instruction during the day might be "one-half to the study of Arabic, the
 
other to the English subjects," although resistance from "the two American
 
(
non-Muslim) teachers" is anticipated by the School Board members.
 "To them,
 
of course this isn't so import an t.
 I mean
 they  can
't see  the  importance,
 but  
it is important,  and it's our school," Sr. Ann stressed.  For their part, the
 
American or non-Musl i
m teachers fully support the religious premise of the
 
School, finding it compatible with their own deeply held religious beliefs as
 
Christians.
 However, they have concerns about the amount of time allotted to
 
S
 
S
 
-13-
"the basics"--the core courses required by the Washington State Department of
 
Education--for which, as the certified teachers, they are directly responsible.
 
Yet, even in teaching these basic subjects, both teachers consciously attempt
 
to include religious principles and "the presence of Allah" in their lessons
 
and interaction with the children.  For example, during a morning science class
 
Mrs. Crum helped her 2nd-6th grade class understand the earth's rotation on its
 
axis, the planet's movement around the sun, and the relationship of these
 
activities to day, night and seasonal changes.  Using globe, flashlight, and
 
Irfan as a very steady "sun" holder, Mrs. Crum and the children portrayed the
 
changes and talked about the effects on the children's lives.
 "When the days
 
are longer, I can play outside more," Mubarak realized.
 "The time for salat
 
changes," Rohymah recalled.
 Bringing an interesting and informative science
 
lesson to a close, Mrs. Crum reminded the children that such things were not
 
an accident, but are "part of Allah's plan".
 
Still, the ranking order of the "important" subjects and the "sufficient
 
time" allotted remains a potentially serious area for misunderstanding and even
 
conflict.  For a Muslim, "all of the sources of the Islamic religion, not just
 
the Qur'an, but many, many other things are in Arabic.  For someone to be a
 
well-educated Muslim, you have to know Arabic."  Although the "total immersion"
 
Arabic language plan for the Preschool has not as yet been realized, or the
 
"truly bilingual, Arabic-English" Kindergarten and Elementary program, the
 
School Board remains committed to this ideal as the way to provide Arabic
 
fluency for its Muslim children.  During the final quarter of the 1981-82 school
 
year, the School Board supported some changes in the teaching day to accommodate
 
"more Islam" in the subject areas, particularly in those generally associated
 
with the humanities or social sciences.
 Sr. Samia El-Moslimany began coming
 
to the School in the afternoons to lead the classes in art and music, emphasizing
 
Islamic influences, characteristics, and appreciation.
 In one art project the
 
2nd-6th graders practiced calligraphy, writing the name "Allah", then braiding
 
colored streamers to paste onto the decorative handwriting.
 Sr. Mary Abdi, an
 
Assistant Teacher in the Elementary program, began to assume full responsibility
 
for the social studies portion of the curriculum during this same quarter.
 Often
 
on Fridays Sr. Mary would present "Islamic Social Studies," that is, the lesson
 
for that day would focus on a country from the Muslim world.
 Sr. Diana Akhgar,
 
the School's Administrative Secretary, was a guest speaker in the 2nd-6th grade
 
when the lesson was on Iran.  As Sr. Ann sees it:
 "Samia was able to have the
 
music have something to do with Islam, when it can, and the art, and everything
 
else I"
 
S

.11 The Islamic School of Seattle does not observe the frequent secular
 
and religious holidays typical of American public, and some private, schools.
 
The Parents Manual: A Guide for Muslim Parents Living in North America (
1976:
 
The Women's Committee of The Muslim Students' Association of the US and Canada),
 
a source turned to for advice by many Seattle Muslim parents and educators, has
 
a useful perspective:
 "In approaching the matter of American holiday observ-
ances, we Muslims should remember the fact that we are not living in the coun-
try simply to forget our own Islamic values and identity and blindly to fit into
 
the patterns of the prevailing culture.  Rather we are the pioneers of Islam in
 
this continent, and our task is to maintain our Islam in purity and to take its
 
light to others."  During the traditional Christmas vacation period for most
 
schools, members of the School's staff and volunteers from the Muslim community
 
planned a "Winter Camp" for the children.  Activities during the Thursday morn-
ing-Saturday afternoon period included "camping out" in the school building,
 
-14-
organized games, arts and crafts, a field-trip to the Seattle zoo,  and salat. 
In order to involve the entire family, parents and siblings were invited to
 
evening activities,  "pot-luck" dinners, and evening salat.
 
For Muslims,  'Eid al-Fitr  (
the Festival of Fast-Breaking at the con-
clusion of Ramadan) and 'Eid al-Adha  (
the Festival of Sacrifice occurring at
 
the time of hajj, or the pilgrimage to Mecca) are the major events of the year.
 
During the celebration of the last 'Eid al-Adha Seattle Muslims gathered in
 
the School's refurbished gymnasium for a pot-luck dinner.
 The informal evening
 
included two impromtu speeches, while "a rousing volleyball game topped off the
 
event."  Increasingly, Seattle Muslims are attending community functions at the
 
Islamic School.  For example, The Islamic Center of Seattle held its benefit-
dinner in the School's gymnasium last May, raising more than $500 for camping
 
scholarships.
 
S. Teachers.
 
The teaching staff of the Islamic School of Seattle changed frequently
  
during the 1981-82 academic year. As with any new undertaking, alterations
 
in expectations, changes in plans, and unforeseen circumstances or events re-
quire management, or just plain coping.
 Between December, 1981, and April,
 
1982, five individuals joined the full-time teaching faculty, bringing it to
 
seven.  The teaching staff of the Islamic School of Seattle includes:
 
(
1) Mrs. Ruth Crum, Director of the Elementary Program and the  
2nd-6th Grades' Teacher, became a member of the School's faculty in December,
 
1981.  Mrs. Crum holds a B.A. from Seattle University and Washington State
 
certification in elementary and high school levels.  For twenty years she
 
taught within the Bellevue, Washington, school district, although most re-
cently she spent a year in Peru and three years in Yemen teaching within the
 
local schools, primarily in the ESL program.
 
(
2) Mrs. Carol Thorne, Kindergarten-First Grade Teacher, was
 
hired in April,  1982.  Mrs. Thorne earned her B.A. from the University of
 
Washington, Seattle, specializing in elementary or primary education.
 Be-
fore coming to the Islamic School, Mrs. Thorne taught for several years i:
 
a suburban Roman Catholic school and most recently was a substitute teach
 
in the City of Seattle public schools.
 
(
3) Ummil Khair Ishfaaq, Director of the Preschool and a Teacher,
 
came to head the program in December, 1981.
 Sr. Ummil earned her A.A. degree
 
in early childhood education from Seattle Central Community College.  Before
 
joining the faculty, Sr. Ummil had operated her own successful, Montessori
 
preschool program in her home.
 It was founded as the first "Muslim preschool"
 
in Seattle--predating the efforts of the Islamic School of Seattle--and many
 
children came specifically for the Islamic atmosphere that Sr. Ummil attempted
 
to create.  With financial assistance from the School Board, Sr. Ummil is tak-
ing additional Montessori classes during the summer at a local community col-
lege.
 
(
4) Husein Saleh, Arabic Teacher for Kindergarten and Elementary  
classes, has been teaching Arabic at the School since January, 1982.  Br.
 
Husein is not trained in foreign language teaching, but draws upon his own
 
experiences in learning English as a second language and his wife's expertise
 
as a linguist to help him prepare his lessons.  A native-speaker of Arabic, Br.
 
Husein came to the United States from Jordan four years ago to study for a M.A.

(
5) Muhammad Nassir Jappee, Arabic Teacher in the Preschool, joined
 
the faculty in May,  1982.
 Br. Muhammad grew up in South Africa, learning Arabic
 
as a student in Saudi Arabia.
 Before coming to Seattle, he taught Arabic to
 
English-speaking students in Johannesburgh.
 In addition to Arabic language in-
struction, Br. Muhammad taught calligraphy on occasion to the 2nd-6th graders
 
and assisted Sr. Samia in teaching Arabic songs to the elementary school children
 
for the Islamic Center camp-benefit.
 
(
6) Azhar Ibrahim, Teacher's Aid in the Preschool, is the only
 
member of the present teaching faculty to have started in September,  1981, when
 
the Islamic School of Seattle opened for its second year--the first in its new
 
building.
 Sr. Azhar has her M.A. in Persian studies, and she is frequently
 
called upon to use her background in religion, Qur'anic, and Islamic social
 
studies.
 
(
7) Mary Abdi, Teacher's Aid in the Kindergarten and Elementary  
classes, became a member of the teaching faculty in November, 1981.
 Sr. Mary
 
is an undergraduate student in anthropology, with an interest in elementary
 
education, at the University of Washington, Seattle.  Working with Mrs. Crum
 
and Mrs. Thorne, Sr. Mary assists with reading groups, homework assignments,
 
review exercises, while the teachers work with the other class members.  More
 
recently, Sr. Mary has been assuming the responsibility for social studies
 
and religion classes.
 
In addition to these full-time teachers and aids, the Islamic School of
 
Seattle depends on the services of volunteers from the Muslim community to
 
augment particular areas.  For example, Sr. Samia taught Islamic art and music,
 
Sr. Jodi has helped with reading and spelling, and before her marriage and move
 
to Indiana Sr. Zainab Ubaidullah taught religion.
 In the beginning of the
 
1981-82 school year, native-speakers of Arabic who had children in the Schoo l
 
were enlisted as Arabic teachers in exchange for their children's tuition.

was a temporary solution, one that did not succeed, for the most part.  Teachers
 
have been recruited through announcements in local college and university place-
ment offices, Mrs. Crum and Mrs. Throne were hired in this manner; through an
 
announcement distributed at a recent Muslim Students' Association annual meeting
 
in Bloomington,  Indiana; through a listing with the Washington State Employment
 
Service; and through "word-of-mouth".  Br. Muhammad first heard about the open-
ing for an Arabic instructor while he was on his way to Seattle!  Currently, a
 
teacher trained in language pedagogy has been recruited from Egypt, and the
 
School Board is hopeful that he will be able to join the faculty in the 1982-83
 
academic year.

. Children.
 
When the 1981-82 school year ended on June 11,  1982, forty-seven children
 
between the ages of 2Â½ and 12 were enrolled in three classes:
 Preschool,  23;
 
Kindergarten & First,  10; and Second through Sixth, 14.
 Boys outnumbered girls,
 
but not by much.  More than two-dozen families were sending their children to
 
the Islamic School of Seattle.  These families represented at least six dif-
ferent ethnic or national backgrounds; these families claimed as many as six
 
different native or "home" languages.
 Some of the families were in the United
 
States only temporarily, planning to return "home" when a job or a degree was
 
finished; for others, America had become their new home.  And, unfortunately,
 
for some other families there was no "home" to return to.
 Perhaps a quarter of
 
the children were from Black American or Balalian *
 families--families that had
 
been "American" for generations.  What did these children and their familie
 
have in common?  The acceptance of Islam,  the pride in calling themselve
 
Muslim, the desire to learn the language of their faith, Arabic.
 
7
.1 The children in Mrs. Crum's class know why they come to the Islamic
 
School of Seattle:
 "Our(My)
 arents(father, mother)  send(s) us(me)!"
 
7.2 And these students, aged seven to twelve, are quite certain why it  
is that their parents want them to come: 
"Here I am with other Muslims."
 "At
 
this school I am able to pray."
 "I can learn Arabic.
 I can learn to be a good
 
Muslim."
 "The teachers here are good.
 They are Muslims, like me."
 
7
.3 Response to my question,  "What classes do you like the most?", was
 
immediate and unanimous:
 "Arabic!"  Talking with the children,  several sug-
gested other "favorites", for example,  "recess", which prompted delighted
 
giggles from a class trying vainly to be "serious" while being recorded by
 
the now-familiar visitor.
 This distraction aside, the children's focus was
 
clearly upon those subjects unique to their School:
 studying Arabic, memorizing
 
Qur'anic verses, working on Islamic art projects.  Eager to show me how much
 
Arabic they each had learned,  as well as to hear their voices on the tape, many
 
of the children volunteered estimates of the size of his or her Arabic vocabu-
lary.
 Why do you like studying Arabic? Lawrence, an eight-year old boy quite
 
new to the School:
 "I like Arabic because Allah made this kind of language."
 
Do you practice Arabic at home? 
"Yes.
 It's the language of our religion,"
 
several stressed.
 
7
.4 All but two of the children enrolled in the 2nd-6th grade class had
 
attended one or more schools before coming to The Islamic School of Seattle.*
 
Consequently, many of them could offer comparisons of their experience in those  
schools with being a student here. 
Several of the children had been in school
 
in other countries:
 "At this school we learn English," said Ibrahim, a boy
 
who had previously attended a school in Saudi Arabia.  Mubarak, a Black Ameri-
can or Balalian, emphasized that at the Islamic School he knew that he would
 
receive "right lessons"; Lawrence, another Balalian, was grateful that at this
 
school "there is no fightin' or hittin'".  Rohymah, a Chain refugee* and the
 
oldest girl in the class, observed quietly:  "We come to learn to be Muslims."
 
7
.5 For most of the children in this class, and like those in the other
 
classes, school hours provide the only  (
or nearly so) time to see one another.
 
With the exception of the Chains who have largely been housed together in apart-
ment buildings in Seattle, and some of the families residing in university or
 
college housing units, most of the children and their families are "scattered"
 
-18-
throughout Seattle's many neighborhoods.
 One family even lives in suburban
 
Kent, necessitating a trip of sixty miles each day by car for the father in
 
order to have his children attend school.
 Several of the children attend
 
"Sunday School" at the Mosque,  learning Arabic and religion in classes with
 
some of their classmates, joined by other Muslim children who are not stu-
dents at The Islamic School of Seattle.  And while there is no "official"
 
relationship between the Mosque School and The Islamic School, many of the
 
same people involved in one are involved in the other.  For instance, Sr.
 
Samia teaches Arabic to the children on Sundays, and Sr. Ann proudly reports
 
that "our children are the star pupils!"
 
7.6  Finally, how do the children feel about attending their school,
 
The Islamic School of Seattle? Certainly, they're glad to be there!  During
 
an earlier impromtu discussion, Jamilla and her younger brother Ibrahim both
 
spoke excitedly about only having "a few more weeks and we'll be off proba-
tion!"  Referring to the official "trial period" of six weeks for all new
 
students,  Jamilla and Ibrahim were counting the days until the School would
 
be truly theirs:
 "Just sixteen more days and we'll be real students!" Jamilla
 
enthusiastically reminded her brother.  Asking the children to help me under-
stand what coming to The Islamic School of Seattle means to them, I suggested  
they attempt to think how each of them might describe their School to a new
  
child, a child of their own age1 coming to the School for his or her first  
day-
Jamilla:
 "Coming to the Islamic School would be like coming
 
to a new world."
 
Ibrahim:
 "I would teach him how to pray."
 
Mubarak:
 "I would teach him the Arabic alphabet."
 
Jamilla:
 "We have different subjects."
 
Mubarak:
 "We're Muslims and they're not, but we can still
 
teach them to be good Muslims."
 
Rohymah:
 "I would show the girls how to cover their heads so
 
they would be comfortable."

History of the Islamic School of Seattle
 
From three families and a handful of unmarried students in the
 
early 1
960s, the Muslim community of Seattle has grown t
o between 7
,000
 
and 9
,000 in the 1980s. In the past decade the community has
 
experienced i
ts greatest growth, accompanied by a dramatic increase i
n
 
the number of its school-age children. On February 3
,  1
980 a small
 
group of Muslim women from the Seattle area met officially for the
 
first t
ime t
o found a school. Upon incorporation of the Islamic School
 
o
f Seattle on February 24, 1
980, these Muslim parents and educators
 
became the Board of Directors.
 
The aims of the Islamic education provided by the school are
 
articulated c
learly in the Parent Handbook, a twelve-page booklet
 
written by the Muslim administrators and distributed to the school's
 
f
amilies. The school's goals are:
 
1
. To provide our children with an atmosphere, as
 
to the Islamic ideal as possible, in which they can
 
grow and learn as whole individuals,  intellectually,
 
spiritually, and physically.
 
2
. To strengthen them to meet and to effectively deal
 
with the challenges of living in the modern American
 
society.
 
3
. To instill in them a pride in their heritage by
 
enabling them to approach knowledge from a Muslim point
 
of view and by presenting a balanced education with as
 
much emphasis on the Muslim world a
s on the West.
 
4
. To offer the ultimate in academic excellence so that
 
our children are prepared to take an active and
 
dominant role in the world in which they live.
 
5
. To foster lasting fraternal bonds with their Muslim
 
classmates.
 
6
. To enable them t
o master the Arabic language so that
 
they may have ready access to the original sources of
 
Islamic knowledge.
 
The p
ilot project, a modified Montessori preschool  and
 
kindergarten,  opened September 2
,  1980.  During its first year the
 
I
slamic School of Seattle shared facilities with the Islamic Center of
 
Seattle,  both occupying a house owned by the Islamic Center in the
 
c
ity's south end at 4919 3
1st Avenue South. Children between the ages
 
o
f two-and-a-half and five were recruited by the school's founders,
 
t
elephoned every Muslim family in Seattle having children in that ag
 
range and told them about the new school, urging them to enroll thei
 
children. For Ann El-Moslimany, a parent of three teenage children, and
 
the other founders the strategy was straightforward.  "We knew all the
 
families in that category." The solicitations of the school's founders
 
were positively received, says Sister Ann, since,  "mothers of Muslim
 
children know our children need the support of Muslim peers and Muslim
 
education," to keep them from being pulled in two directions.
 
The success of the school's initial preschool offering provided
 
encouragement and enthusiasm for acquiring an appropriate facility and
 
expanding the program to the upper grades. During the spring,of 1
981
 
serious consideration was given to the pros and cons of building a
 
K
 
school at a new site or of buying an older building. Finally,  a solidly
 
built,  two-story schoolhouse in Seattle's central section was located.
 
The architecturally impressive structure at 720 25th Avenue, built in
 
1
930, was first occupied by the Hebrew Academy.  In the 1960s it was
 
leased to the city as a public-education and youth-services facility.
 
During the 1
970s, however,  i
t stood empty, a target for vandals. The
 
building was in sad disrepair when Seattle Muslims purchased it for
 
$350,000.  "
1 was in Kuwait when  they called me about  f
inding the
 
b"ilding," s
ays Sister Ann.
 
I
t was a lot of money,  ail in cash, and due in three
 
weeks.  I was asked i
f I thought I could raise the
 
money.  I didn't know,  but, upon talking with a family
 
f
 riend who knew more about these things than I did,  i
t
 
was agreed that I should try.  I telephoned back the
 
decision. The deposit of $50,000 was made and we
 
raised what we needed, although it was closer to six
 
weeks by the time all the money was raised and the
 
paperwork done.
 
I
the Muslim community as a whole pitched in on some of the other tasks.
 
4
 
r
enovations have continued a
s funds and r
esources have become
 
available. In addition, skills have been donated by community members.
 
Artist Jamshid Kavoussi handpainted verses from the Qur'an in graceful
 
Arabic script a
t child's eye level along the building's main hallway,
 
and the name "
Islamic School of Seattle" in English and Arabic above
 
the entrance door.
 
I
n December 1
981  t
he Washington State Board of Education granted
 
full state approval t
o the preschool and elementary programs offered by
 
t
he Islamic School of Seattle, f
inding that the school met all f
ire,
 
health, and safety codes and was providing qualified teachers for i
ts
 
programs. At the close of t
he 1
981-1982 school year more than fifty
 
children between the ages o
f two-and-a-half and twelve were enrolled i
n
 
t
he preschool, kindergarten, and grade-school programs. As is the case
 
in other schools, some of the programs include multiple grades: the
 
kindergarten program includes kindergarten and first grades, while the
 
grade-school program encompasses second through sixth grade. The
 
certified t
eachers directing the programs are assisted by full-time
 
Muslim teaching assistants, Arabic instructors, and volunteers from the
 
Seattle Muslim community.
 
Support for the purchase and continuing renovation and operation
 
of the school has come from members of the Muslim community throughout
 
the United States and abroad, especially Kuwait, Qatar
aÃ±cf Saudi
 
Arabia. The Arabic word zakat, which literally means "purification,"
 
has no actual precise English equivalent;  i
t is a Muslim's worship of
 
5
 
God by means of h
is wealth t
hrough an obligatory form o
f giving t
o
 
those in need. Zakat /unds may also be spent in the cause of God f
or
 
the construction of mosques or religious schools and hospitals, and for
 
the salaries of those involved in the propagation or s
tudy of I
slam
 
whose work keeps them f
rom having t
ime t
o earn a l
ivelihood.
 
I
3esides t
he payment o
f the obligatory zakat) I
slam also urges
 
Muslims t
o give voluntary charity,  t
o the extent they can afford,  t
o
 
those in need. Indeed, charitableness i
s among the most stressed
 
qualities in Islam,  because Muslims are supposed t
o b
e always
 
r
esponsive t
o human n
eed and distress. Muslims regard their wealth a
s a
 
trust from God which i
s t
o be used not only for themselves and their
 
family, but for other human beings in need as well. The proper Muslim
 
attitude i
s clearly set out in the Qur'an:
 
You will not a
ttain righteousness until you spend out
 
of that which you love. And whatever you spend from
 
[
your] possessions, indeed God is aware of it. (3:9/)
 
They ask thee [Muhamma d] what they should spend. Say:
 
.
1 They
 
is beyond your needs." (2:2J.)
 -
 
Consequently, donations that have been made to the Islamic School
 
of Seattle must be understood not as the largess of wealthy individuals
 
but as an act of worship required of all Muslims in the practice of
 
their faith. For example, Sister Jodi and her husband are students at
 
the university. They have a small daughter, Insh'allah, who will attend
 
the preschool in September 1
982. Like most student couples raising a
 
6
 
family and going to university,  f
inancial constraints are very r
eal.
 
Nonetheless  Sister Jodi assumes her responsibility as a Muslim and
 
designates her zakat i, t
he I
slamic School.
 
Islam i
s a complete code of life.  Muslims must seek knowledge of
 
the basic t
enets of Islam and relate then to all aspects of individual
 
and social l
ife.  Parents are responsible for their children, and the
 
Islamic community has an obligation,  therefore,  to educate its children
 
in the path of Islam. When the Seattle Muslim community is unable to
 
fulfill this responsibility alone,  it is I
slamically correct for i
t to
 
approach the worldwide Muslim community for assistance. Such an appeal
 
for assistance need not have only monetary aims. Husein Saleh,  the
 
Arabic teacher in the grade school program,  is teaching in response to
 
a sense of obligation.  "I am not trained in teaching Arabic," he says.
 
"My wife i
s a linguist and she has helped me prepare many of the
 
materials. My training and interest is in many fields. For example, I
 
have my master's in urban planning. But, it is my obligation to teach
 
Arabic. Each day I ask if they have found another teacher. How can I
 
not teach the students Arabic? It is our language of our religion. It
 
is my duty."
 
To meet i
ts financial obligations,  the Islamic School of Seattle
 
has relied heavily on donations from Muslim individuals and
 
organizations. The school has encouraged individuals and groups to plan
 
fund-raising activities.  It also charges its students tuition.  In
 
7
 
addition,  i
t has  initiated educational projects which will provide
 
income for its fund and has begun planning for an endowment fund to
 
ensure i
ts financial well-being and continuation.
 
In addition to monetary donations, offers of supplies and
 
volunteer labor from Muslim parents, students, and community members
 
have frequently helped stretch funds  received even further. A
 
community-wide effort was put forth to shape up the new school building
 
for the first day of class last September, and a similar effort readied
 
the new preschool room for i
ts February opening.  In addition, members
 
of the community have aided the school over and over again by donating
 
needed items.  "Twice our needs have been met even before we asked,"
 
notes -
-
-
-
-
-
-
-
.
 On the very day that we had to place an order for
 
additional tables and chairs for the classroom, Brother Sami Amin, who
 
deals in salvage,  called t
o tell us he had two hundred to donate. On
 
another occasion we decided to announce at Juma' Prayer service that we
 
needed tricycles and other riding toys. Before the announcement was
 
made we were presented with several such toys from a family who was
 
moving. Allah is the knower of all things!"
 
In the past subsidies t
o the school have been provided by two
 
other local Muslim organizations:  the Islamic Center of Seattle and the
 
Muslim Students' Association, University of Washington Chapter.
 The
 
Islamic Center provided the school's first home in 1980-1981 and
 
substantial loans when the school's present building was purchased in
 
March 1981. Currently,  the vice-presid nt of the Officers of the
 
8
 
Corporation, one o
f t
he s
chool's two governing bodies, i
s also the
 
Islamic Center's president. Recently the center held a summer camp
 
b
enefit in the school gymnasium. In September, just a
s the school was
 
opening in its n
ew building, the local branch of the Muslim Students'
 
Association contributed $
9,000 to the school's scholarship fund.
 
During the 1
981-1982 academic year tuition was collected from all
 
children enrolled in each of the ten-week instructional quarters
 
according t
o the following formula:

any quarter, although deferred payment contracts were available.
 
Families with f
inancial hardship have been eligible fo
par-tial tuition
 
reductions through the scholarship fund, a limited resource which is
 
dependent upon donations designated for this purpose. While it was
 
9
 
hoped that tui ti o n  would b
e able to cover the salaries of the
 
instructional staff (excluding medical insurance payments),  in
 
actuality such revenue rarely covered more  t
han one-third of  that cost
 
in 1981-1982. Daycare was also available for each child staying at the
 
school from 7

School Administration
 
The administration and governance of the school i
s handled by two
 
separate,  but related, entities: The Board of Directors and  the Officer
 
of the Corporation  Members of the Board of Directors helped to
 
funds from the Muslim community to start the school and remain t
 
overseers of the school's assets. Four Muslim women have been members
 
of the board since February 1980: Zain I
Jbaidullah, Ann El-Moslitnany,
 
Rafia Khokhar, and Suzette Kakar. In addition, because the school wants
 
to remain responsive to the community it serves, an administrative
 
board,  the Officers of the Corporation, has been selected from
 
interested community members. The Officers of the Corporation meet
 
weekly to establish future policies and priorities and consider
 
day-to-day problems. They are in charge of all personnel, curriculum,
 
and budget matters, as well as building plans. They consult with the
 
school's teaching staff on a monthly basis and with other individuals
 
as needed. Currently ,
 six individuals are serving as' Officers of the
 
Corporation: Abdul-Raojf Mannaa,  (president), Faizullah Kakar
 
1
0
 
(vice -president)  Suzette Kakar (
secretary), Ann El-1oslimany
 
(fund-raising chairman abroad), Abdullal
-i Abduljabbar, and Mohammad
 
El Moslimany. The Position of treasurer, formerly occupied by Abdalla
 
Shamia,  i
s vacant;  those duties are currently being handled by the
 
b
oard as a whole.
 
The s
chools' administrative or office personnel s
taff currently
 
includes two positions. Diana Akhgar was hired in December as
 
administrative secretary, t
o take charge of the day-to-day, on-site
 
needs of the school in conjunction with the Officers o
f the
 
Corporation. Decisions about the misbehavior of a child, the taking of
 
class photographs, and the work of a particular contractor are all
 
considered during the weekly meetings of the school officers. Daily
 
concerns considered during the weekly meeting may effectively crowd out
 
those that are less immediate. Time that might be spent in profitable
 
discussion of long-range goals, such as the securing of contributions
 
to establish an endowment fund, can easily be diverted by hearing about
 
an isolated classroom incident involving one or two children. Because
 
there is no individ ual a
t the school on a daily basis with the
 
authority t
o make decisions and carry out policy, there i
s considerable
 
latitude for administrative confusion and breakdowns in communication
 
between and among teachers, staff,  parents, children, and community
 
members.

Irene J u n e -j)
 has  he
 driving  th
 school's  eco oiji e  van  s
 
Islamic School of Seattle opened two years ago.  She i
s employed
 
directly by a group of parents to provide transportation for th
 
children along an established route. In addition,  Sister Irene drives
 
the van on field trips, such as the hayride at the Aqua Barn &
 
School for the preschoolers in May, and provides transportation for
 
those in the school's new Women's English Program. The custodial or
 
service personnel staff has three members. t
1ohamath Toulas,  father of
 
two of the older grade school children, is the school's custodian.
 
Mohammad Javaharian and Yaghoub Ebrahimi occupy small,  remodeled rooms
 
in the school's basement in exchange for carrying out the
 
responsibilities of  night watchman.
 
The significance of the employment of these individuals is not
 
missed.  Indeed,  it was highlighted in a recent fund-raising "news
 
update":  "An important spin-off of the school has been the jobs which
 
we have been able to provide to Muslims from within the Seattle
 
community." At the time of that newsletter Muslim employees included
 
two preschool teachers, one elementary teacher's aid, one Arabic
 
teacher, one secretary, one director of the Women's English Program,
 
one school bus driver, and one custodian. The newsletter also points
 
out that employment at the school offers special benefits to two
 
specific groups:  "Muslim women who find it necessary to work are now
 
spared the difficulties of working in a non-Islamic environment,'  and

Meetings of the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) are scheduled on
 
one Saturday afternoon a month and held at the school. Children take
 
home announcements of these meetings and parents are encouraged t
o
 
attend to get to know the other parents and their children's  teachers.
 
Items on the agenda for the January 30,  1
982 meeting included:
 
transportation,  the new Arabic teacher, the new elementaryâ€”school
 
teacher, the new preschool directoress and room, the school's recent
 
accreditation,  upcoming PTA elections, and fund raising. During the
 
school year the PTA's Parents Committee held a series of rummage sales,
 
raising more than $1,000 towards the purchase of playground equipment.
 
Participation by parents has been estimated at approximately ten to
 
fifteen percent, a level comparable to that achieved by other PTA
 
groups. With a student population numbering less than fifty, and more
 
than one student coming from each family in many cases, even a
 
higher participatory level would not produce more than a
 
andful of active PTA members.

The Islamic School' s teaching staff changed frequently during the
 
1981-1982 academic year. Between December 1981 and April 1982 five
 
individuals joined the full - time faculty, bringing the total to s
even.
 
The teaching staff of the school includes:
 
(
1) Mrs. Ruth Crum, who directs and teaches the grade-school
 
program (second through sixth grade),  became a member of the school's
 
faculty in December 1981. She holds a B
.A. from Seattle University and
 
certification from the state of Washington at both the elementary and
 
high- school level.  She taught for twenty years within the Bellevue
 
[Washington] School District. Most recently she spent
-
'a y
'e'ar in Peru
 
and three years in Yemen,  teaching primarily English -
-ï¿½
as - a-Second-
Language (ES Q  in local schools.

er B
.A. from the University of Washington,
 
Seattle, specializing in elementary education. Before cowing to the
 
Islamic School, Mrs. Thorne taught for several years in a Suburban
 
Roman Catholic school and was a substitute t
eacher for the city of
 
Seattle.
 
(
3) Ummil Khair I
shfaaq joined the staff as director and teacher
 
of the preschool program in December 1
981. Sister Ummil earned her A
.A.
 
(Associate Arts degree) i
n early childhood education from Seattle
 
Central Community College. Before joining the faculty she operated a
 
Successful Montessori preschool program in her home. I
t was the first
 
Muslim preschool in Seattle â€”predating the efforts of the Islamic
 
School of Seattle â€”and many children attended the school specifically
 
for the I
slamic atmosphere that Sister Ummil created. She is currently
 
taking additional Montessori classes during the summer at a local
 
community college with t
he financial assistance of the Officers of the
 
Corporation.
 
(
4) Husein Saleh, Arabic t
eacher for the kindergarten and
 
grade - school classes, has been at the school since January 1982.
 
Untrained in foreign-language teaching, he draws upon his own
 
experiences in learning English as a second language and his wife's
 
expertise a
s a linguist in preparing his lessons. Dr. Husein, who is a
 
native speaker of Arabic, came to the United States from Jordan four
 
years ago t
o study for an M
.A. in urban planning at the University of
 
Oklahoma.
 
(
5) Muhammad Nassir Jappee, preschool Arabic t
eacher, joined t
he
 
faculty in May 1982. A native of South Africa, he learned Arabic as a
 
Student in Saudi Arabia. Before coming to Seattle he taught Arabic to
 
English-speaking students in Johannesburg, South Africa. In addition t
o
 
Arabic-language instruct ion , Dr. Muhammad has taught calligraphy on
 
occasion to the school's second- through sixth-grade students, and has
 
also assisted Sainla El Moslimany to teach them Arabic songs for the
 
Islamic Center Camp benefit.
 
(6) Azhar Ibrahim ,
 t
eacher's aid in the preschool, is the only
 
member of the present faculty to have started in September 1981, when
 
the Islamic School of Seattle opened for its second year. Sister Azhar,
 
who has an M
.A. in Persian studies, is frequently called upon to share
 
her knowledge of religion, the Qur'an, and Islamic social studies.
 
(
7) Mary Abdi, who i
s a teacher's aid in the kindergarten and
 
grade-school classes, became a member of the teaching staff in'
 
November
 
1
981. She i
s an undergraduate student in anthropology at the University
 
of Washington, Seattle and has a special interest in elementary
 
education. Sister Mary works with Mrs. Crum and Mrs  Thorne, assisting
 
with reading groups, homework assignments  and revi w exercises while
 
the teachers work with other class members. More recently she has been
 
conducting social studies and religion classes.

schedule: director of the grade-school program, $1,111; director o
f the
 
preschool p

eacher, $700; and
 
teaching assistants and Arabic teachers, $4.75 per hour.
 
The t
eaching staff i
s augmented by volunteers from Seattle's
 
Muslim c
ommunity. For example, Samia El-Moslimany, a college student
 
and daughter o
f Sister Ann, has been teaching Islamic art and music
 
classes i
n the grade-school program. Sister Jodi has recently begun
 
a
ssisting w

program. Also, before her marriage and subsequent move to Indiana last
 
fall, Zainab Ubaidullah, a member of the Board of Directors and i
ts
 
"
Perpetual President," taught religion t
o the grade-school students.

families were sending their children to the Islamic School of Seattle.
 
These families represented at least six different ethnic or national
 
backgrounds, claiming as many native languages as well. : Some of the
 
families are in the United States only temporarily, -'planning to return
 
home when a job or degree i
s finished. For others America has become

their n
ew h
ome. Unfortunately, for a few there i
s no l
onger a hone
 
waiting. Perhaps a quarter of the children were from black-American or
 
Balalian families. What do these children and their families have i
n
 
common? The acceptance o
f I
slam, the pride of calling themselves
 
Muslim, and t
he desire t
o l
earn Arabic, the language o
f their faith.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
The p
reschool curriculum i
ncludes Arabic, primarily vocabulary
 
building, pre-reading and pre -mathematics (sometime using Montessori
 
equipment), physical activity, organized games, and free play in the
 
gymnasiuur or outdoors. In addition,  the Preschool curriculum offers
 
r
eligion, memorization of Qur'anic verses, d
iscussiju o  L
s1 n
 
manners, and stories of the prophets. Preschoolers regularly
 
participate in the daily r
equirements of their faith: the teachers show
 
them how t
o make wudu (wash) in preparation for salat (prayer or
 
worship). While the children usually have salat,2
ir own
 
classroom, they are also often taken to the gymnasium to participate in
 
prayer along with the older children, faculty members and staff, women
 
enrolled in the Women's English Program, and Muslim visitors to the
 
school.
 
The curriculum for the kindergarten and grade-school programs
 
includes Arabic reading, writing, and conversatjon,ureljgjon, Islamic
 
art and music, social studies from an Islamic viewpoint, and spelling.

learned I
slamic music on Thursdays. The kindergarten program had a
 
similar schedule: social s
tudies from an Islamic viewpoint Wednesday
 
afternoons and handwriting on Thursdays.
 
The k
indergarten and grade-school children also have regular
 
periods for religious activity. The day opens with the recitation of
 
t
he Fatiha (
 
)
.
 Later in the day time is devoted to memorizing
 
Qurtanic verses through collective and individual recitation. The
 
afternoon includes

serving as the iman or leader of the service.
 
The t

For example, the daily religion class in the kindergarten program i

half hour, while the grade-school religion class lasts twenty minutes
 
each day. Wudu

her forty minutes to the time set
 
aside in the afternoon for I
slamic practices. Generally, the time
 
periods in the grade-school program range from thirty to seventy-five
 
minutes. Arabic instruction takes up at least thirty-five minutes of
 
each school day, excluding the time spent on the language as part of
 
the daily r
eligion class, salat

Some o
f the curriculum materials come from major publishers in the
 
United States. The social s
tudies texts are published by MacMillan as
 
part o
f their series Places Near and Far. Other texts are donated by
 
Muslim c
ountries through o
fficial government or educational sources.
 
For instance, the Saudi Arabian Educational Mission to the United
 
States Contributed Arabic-language textbooks. In addition, the school
 
uses texts developed, published, and distributed by Muslims through
 
their own publishing concerns, bookstores, and organizations. The
 
Islamic Foundation of Leicester, England produces The Muslim Children's
 
Library, a series of small well -produced books to help a Muslim child
 
"
develop a fresh faith, a dynamic commitment, a strong identity, and a
 
throbbing yearning and urge to struggle â€”all rooted in Islam ; Muslim
  
Nursery Rhymes, Assalauiu Alaikum (Peace Be with You), and several other
 
books from the series are in use in the preschool.
 
The curriculum is established and supervised by the six Officers
 
of the Corporation. Certified teachers and trained
 
educator-administrators who have accepted Islam may be given more
 
authority over curriculum development in the future; due to the lack of
 
such trained Muslim personnel at the present time, however,, these tasks
 
have been the responsibility of the school officers." In establishing
 
the school curriculum the officers have sought advice from certified

director o
f the grade - sc hool program and teacher of kindergarten
 
through s
ixth grade (later second through s
ixth grades) she initiated
 
the weekly walks to the public branch library just a few blocks from
 
the school. A bookmobile regularly visits the school so that Ummil
 
Khajr [
shfaaq, director of the preschool, can select appropriate books
 
for her children
 
/ All of the teachers rely on ho
outs  to rei nforce
 their lessons.
 
For example, Dr. Husein prepares sheets with pictures of familiar
 
animals and objects, followed by their name in Arabic, leaving a space
 
for the children to practice writing the correct identification. Sister
 
Mary found t
hat the children in the kindergarten class remembered and
 
understood the topic of a religion class better when she iniluded a
 
supporting exercise, such as a worksheet to complete, or an assignment
 
to "draw and color what we have been talking about." Several of these
 
21
 
sheets were collected t
ogether in a religious booklet made by the
 
children a
s part of a religion class booklet. Mrs. Crum and Mrs. Thorne
 
r
ely on similar handouts, a
s well as on colored construction paper,
 
recycled computer printouts, and other assorted materials to encourage
 
the children and to stimulate their minds. Due to limited resources,
 
the teachers and the children have had to be creative. In the preschool
 
Sister Ummil has introduced the children to "
rnanipulatives" associated
 
with the Montessori method of instruction. She has also encouraged the
 
children t
o explore the objects in the classroom and plays "word
 
bingo" t
o i
ncrease vocabulary skills.
 
The c
hildren are t
ested and graded on a regular basis. The school
 
year i
s divided into four quarters. Report cards are distributed at the
 
end of each period to the parents at a scheduled parent-teacher
 
conference. Each  card" i

indicate h
ow he or she compares the child's effort to his or her own
 
ability. The card also shows the "achievement grade," which compares
 
the child's achievement with other students at the same grade level.
 
The "key" or ranking procedure is the same for both effort and
 
22
 
achievement: "good,
 satisfactory," and "
needs improvement." At the
 
bottom of the grade form i
s a space for teachers' comments and a place
 
to indicate promotion or grade assignment. Each teacher who works with
 
the child f
ills in the appropriate items and gives his or her
 
evaluation o
f the child's work during the quarter. In addition, parents
 
and teachers are encouraged t
o request a conference at any time during
 
the year. An effort i
s made t
o have interpreters present during such
 
conferences whenever a language problem might arise.
 
Purposes of the School
 
The founders and the officers of the I
slamic School of Seattle
 
have sought t
o provide an Islamic environment for their community's
 
school-age children, not a school for Muslim children where all of
 
their subjects, except religion, are divorced from their Islamic
 
faith. As Sister Ann explains, "It's not that we are trying to pretend
 
that the non-Islamic world doesn't exist, but we'd also like to show
 
our kids that Islam is everywhere. And to let it [
Islam] pervade every
 
aspect of what they are studying." It is this emphasis on an Islamic
 
atmosphere, more than the t
eaching of unusual or religious subjects,
 
that distinguishes the Islamic School of Seattle. Islamic religion and
 
Arabic classes are part of the curriculum at every level. Formal
 
classes in Qur'an, Islamic s
tudies, and classical Arabic are required
 
23
 
o
f all s
tudents in t
he k
indergarten and grade school-programs. During
 
s
chool hours all children are r
equired to participate in salat   
t
aking their places among peers and teachers.
 
Those s
eeking admission for their children are r
eminded by t
he
 
Parent Handbook that a
t t
he I
slamic School of Seattle "Education i
s
 
provided within an Islamic frameworK, and parents should bear i
n mind
 
t
hat I
slam i
s not only a p
art of the curriculum but i
t i
s the e
ssence
 
o
f the school's being." I
t i
s the commitment to Islam as a total way o
f
 
l
ife t
hat p
rovides the f
ramework for the development o
f the school's
 
specialized education program designed t
o meet all the children's
 
n
eeds â€”physical, emotional, educational, and spiritual.
 
There are differences o
f opinion about the importance of specific
 
subject matter and the amount o
f time given to different subjects,
 
however.  For example, there has been discussion about extending the
 
school day for the older children beginning in 1
982-1983. Instruction
 
during the day could then be divided equally between the study of
 
Arabic and the study of English subjects. Resistance to such a change
 
from the two non-Muslim teachers is anticipated by the school board
 
members. "To them, of course, this isn't so important. I mean, they
 
can't see the importance; but i
t is important, and it's our school,"
 
stressed Sister Ann. For their part,  the non-Muslim teachers fully
 
support the religious premise of the school, finding it compatible with
 
t
heir own deeply held religious beliefs as Christians. They have
 
concerns about the amount of t
ime allotted to "the basics,"
 
24
 
however--the core courses r
equired by the Washington S
tate Department
 
of Education â€”for which, a
s certified teachers, they are directly
 
responsible. Yet, even in t
eaching these basic subjects, both teachers
 
consciously attempt t
o include religious principles and the presence of
 
Allah in their lessons and their interaction with the children. During
 
a morning science class, f
or instance, Mrs. Crum helped her
 
grade-school c
lass understand the earth's rotation on i
ts axis, the
 
planet's movement around the sun, and the relationship of these
 
activities t
o day, night, and seasonal changes. Using a globe and
 
flashlight she and the children portrayed the seasonal changes, talking
 
about their e
ffects on the children's lives. "When the days are longer,
 
I can play outside more," r
ealized Mubarak. The t
ime f
or
 
changes," recalled Rohymah. Then, bringing  an interesting and
 
informative science lesson t
o a close, Mrs. Crum reminded the children
 
that such things are not an accident, but are "part of Allah's plan."
 
The ranking order of the important subjects and the allocation
 
time to different classes r
emain potentially serious areas for
 
misunderstanding and even conflict, however. To be a well-educated
 
Muslim, you have to know Arabic. Although the "total immersion" Arabic-
language plan for the preschool has not as yet been r
ealized, or the
 
"truly bilingual, Arabic-English" kindergarten and grade-school
 
programs, the school officers remain committed to this ideal as the way
 
to provide Arabic fluency for its Muslim children. During the final
 
quarter of the 1
981-1982 school year, the officers supported some
 
changes in the teaching day to accomodate more Islam in the subject
 
25
 
areas, particularly in those generally associated with the humanities
 
or social sciences. Samja El-Moslimany began coming to the school i
n
 
t
he a
fternoons t
o lead the classes in art and music, emphasizing
 
Islamic influences, characteristics, and appreciation. In one art
 
project t
he grade -school children practiced calligraphy, writing the
 
name "Allah" and then braiding colored streamers t
o paste onto the
 
decorative handwriting. Mary Abdi, an assistant grade-school teacher,
 
b
eganto assume full responsibility for the social studies portion of
 
the curriculum during the same quarter. On Fridays she would present
 
social studies from an Islamic perspective on a regular basis, focusing
 
on a c
ountry from the Muslim world.
 
The children aged seven to twelve in Ruth Crum's class know why
 
they go t
o the Islamic School of Seattle: their parents send them. They
 
are also quite certain why their parents want them to go:  "Here I am
 
with other Muslims." "At this school I am able to pray." "I can learn
 
Arabic. I can learn to be a good Muslim." "The teachers here are good.
 
They are Muslims, like me." The response to my question,  "What classes
 
do you l
ike the most?" was immediate and unanimous 
â€” Arabic. Talk
 
with the children, several suggested other favorites, for exanipl
 
r
ecess, which prompted delighted giggles from a class trying vainly t
o
 
b
e serious while being recorded by the now-familiar visitor. This
 
distraction aside, the children's focus was clearly upon those subjects
 
unique t
o their school: studying Arabic, memorizing Qur'anic verses,
 
and working on I
slamic art projects. Eager to show me how much Arabic
 
2
6
 
they each had learned, and t
o hear their voices on the t
ape, many o
f
 
the children volunteered e
stimates of the size of his or her Arabic
 
vocabulary.
 
As t
o why they l
ike s
tudying Arabic, Lawrence, an eight -year-old
 
boy quite n
ew t
o the school r
esponded: "
i like Arabic because Allah
 
made this kind of language." Do they practice Arabic a
t h
ome? "Yes,
 
i
t's the l
anguage of our r
eligion," several stressed.
 
All b
ut two of the children enrolled in the grade school program
 
had attended one or more schools before coming to the Islamic School
 
of Seattle. Consequently ,
 many of them could offer comparisons of their
 
experience in those schools with that of being a student at the Islamic
 
School.  "At this school we learn English," said Ibrahim, a boy who
 
previously attended a school in Saudi Arabia. Mubarak, a black-American
 
or Balallan, emphasized that at the Islamic School he knew that he
 
would receive "right lessons." Lawrence, another Balalian, was gratef
 
i
l
l
 
that at this school 'there i
s no fightin' or hittin'."
 
For most of the children school hours provide virtually the only
 
time to see one another. With the exception of the Chains, who have
 
largely been housed together in apartment buildings in Seattle, and
 
some of t
he families residing in university or college housing
' units,
 
most of the children and their families are scattered throughout
 
Seattle. One family lives in suburban Kent, necessitating a trip of
 
sixty miles each day by car so the children can a 
1
. 
ttend school. Several
 
27
 
of the children participate i
n "
Sunday school" at the mosque, l
earning
 
Arabic and religion in classes with some of their classmates. There
 
they are joined by other Muslim children who are not s
tudents at t
he
 
Islamic school of Seattle. Although there is no official relationship
 
between t
he mosque school and the Islamic school, many of the same
 
people are involved in both. For instance, Sister Samia teaches Arabic
 
t
o the children in the mosque school on Sundays, and Sister Ann p
roudly
 
reports, "
Our children are the star pupils!"
 
In t
he f
inal analysis how do the children feel about attending t
he
 
Islamic School of Seattle? Certainly,  they are glad to be there. Dur
 
one discussion Jamilla and her younger brother Ibrahim both spoKe
 
excitedly about only having "a few more weeks and we'll be off
 
probation," referring to the official trial period of six weeks for a
ll
 
new students. They were literally counting the days until the school
 
would be truly theirs: "Just sixteen more days and we'll be real
 
students!" Jamilla enthusiastically reminded her brother. Asking the
 
children t
o help me understand what attending the Islamic School of
 
Seattle means to them, I suggested they attempt to think how each of
 
them might describe their school to a new child, a child of their own
 
age, coming t
o the school for the first t
ime.
 
Jamilla:
 Coming t
o the Islamic School would be like
 
coming t
o a new world."
 
Ibrahim:
 "I would teach him to pray."
 
Mubarak:
 'I would teach him the Arabic alphabet."
 
Jamilla:
 "We have different subjects."
 
r
i
g
 
28
 
Mubarak:
 We're Muslims and they're not, but we can
 
s
till t
each them to be good Muslims."
 
Rohymah:
 I would show the girls how to cover their
 
heads, so they would be comfortable."
 
History of the Islamic School of Seattle
 
From three families and a handful of unmarried s
tudents in the
 
early 1
960s, the Muslim c
ommunity of Seattle has grown t
o between 7
,000
 
and 9
,000 in the 1
980s. In the past decade the community has
 
experienced i
ts greatest growth, accompanied by a dramatic increase i
n
 
the number o
f its schoolâ€”age children. On February 3
, 1
980,a small
 
group of Muslim women from the Seattle area met o
fficially for t
he
 
first t
ime t
o found a school. Upon incorporation of the Islamic School
 
o
f Seattle on Februar
y 24, 1
980, these Muslim parents and educators
 
became the Board of Directors.
 
The a
ims of the I

The success of the

encouragement and enthusiasm for acquiring an appropriate facility
 
ex anding the program t
o t

981
 
se bus consideration was given to the pros and cons of building a

school at a n
ew site or o
f buying an older building. Finally, a s
olidly
 
built, two-story schoolhouse in Seattle's central section was located.
 
The architecturally impressive s
tructure at 720 25th Avenue, built in
 
1
930, was first occupied by the Hebrew Academy. In the 1
960s i)was
 
leased to the city as a public-education and youth-services facility.
 
During the 1
970s, however, i
t stood empty, a target for vandals. The
 
building was in sad disrepair when Seattle Muslims purchased it f
or
 
$350,000. "
I was in Kuwait when they called me about finding the
 
building," says Sister Ann.
 
I
s
 
It was a lot of money, all in cash, and due in three
 
weeks. I was  asked i
f I thought I could raise the
 
money. I didn't know, bu
Aipon talking with a family
 
friend who knew more about these things than I did, it
 
was agreed that I should try. I telephoned back the
 
decision. The deposit of $50,000 was made and we
 
raised what we needed, although i
t was closer t
o six
 
weeks by the t
ime all the money was raised and the
 
paperwork done.
 
Before opening for the 1
981-1982 academic year, the
 
hool 'S
 
founders repaired the lovely red tile roof of their new building,
 
painted and put new flooring in two classrooms on the first floor, and

trust, from God which i

attitude i

i sazly set out in the Qur'an:

Consequently, donations that have been made

but a

s a complete c
ode o
f life.  Muslims must seek knowledge o
f
 
the basic t
enets of Islam and relate them to all a
spects of individual
 
,
-
and social life. Parents are responsible for their children, and the
 
I
slamic c
ommunity has an obligation, therefore, to educate its children
 
in the path o
f Islam. When the Seattle Muslim community is unable t
o
 
fulfill this responsibility alone, it is I
slamically correct for i
-& t
o
 
approach the worldwide Muslim community for assistance. Such an appeal
 
for a
ssistance
 not have only monetary aims. Husein Saleh, the
 
Arabic teacher in the grade school program, i
s teaching in response t
o
 
a sense of obligation. '
.1 am not trained in t
eaching Arabic," he says.
 
"My wife i
s a linguist and she has helped me prepare many of the
 
materials. My training and interest is in many fields. For example, I
 
have my master's in urban planning. But, it i
s my obligation to teach
 
Arabic. Each day I ask i
f they have found another t
eacher. How can I
 
not teach the students Arabic? I
t is our language of our religion. I
t
 
i
s my duty."
 
To meet its financial obligations, the Islamic School of Seattle
 
has relied heavily on donations from Muslim Individuals and
 
organizations. The
chool has encouraged individuals ad groups to plan
 
fundâ€”raising activities. It also charges its students tuition. In

hoped that tuition would be able to cover the salaries of the
 
instructional staff (excluding medical insurance payments), in

School Administration
 
The administration and governance of the'  hool is handled by two
 
separate, but related, entities: The Board of Directors and the Off

of the Corporation. Members of the Board of Directors helped to raise
 
--
funds 4rom the Muslim c o m m u ni t y  t o  s t a rt  the 5chool and remain the
 
overseers of the  chool's assets. Four Muslim women have been members
 
of the
 ard since February 1980: Zain l
Jbaidullah, Ann El-Moslimany,
 
Rafia Khokhar, and Suzette Kakar. In addition, because the 
S chool wants
 
to remain responsive to the community it serves, an administrative
 
board, the Officers of the Corporation, has been selected from
 
interested community members. The Officers of the Corporation meet
 
weekly to establish future policies and priorities and consider

An important spin-off of the school has been the jobs which
 
we have been able to provide to Muslims from within the Seattle
 
community." At the time of that newsletter Muslim employees included
 
"two preschool teachers, one elementary teacher's aid, one Arabic
 
teacher, one secretary, one director of the Women's English Program,
 
one school bus driver, and one custodian. The newsletter also points
 
out that employment at the 5chool offers special benefits to two
 
specific groups: "Muslim women who find it necessary to work are now
 
spared the difficulties of working in a non-Islamic en ironment," and
 
I

and of American society and culture who need t

can work within a more "

Some of the curriculum materials come from major publishers in the
 
United States. The social
, studies texts are published by MacMillan as
 
part of their series Places Near and Far. Other texts are donated by
 
Muslim countries through offi cial government or educational sources.
 
For instance, the Saudi Arabian Educational Mission to the United
 
States contributed Arabic-language textbooks. In addition, the School
 
uses texts developed, published, and distributed by Muslims through
 
their own publishing concerns, bookstores, and organizations.

Islamic Foundation of Leicester, England produces The Muslim Children's
 
Library, a series of small

throbbing yearning and urge to struggle â€”all rooted in Islam y2 Muslim
 
Nursery Rhymes, Assalamu Alaikum (Peace Be with You), and several other
 
books from the series are in uco in the preschool.
 
The curriculum is established and supervised by the six Officers
 
f the Corporation. Certified teachers and trained
 
educator-administrators who have accepted Islam may be given more
 
authority over curriculum development in the futures due to the lack of
 
such trained Muslim personnel at the present time, ho ever', these tasks
 
have been the responsibility of th, $ chool officers. In establishing

Purposes of the School
 
The founders and the officers of the Islamic School of Seattle
 
have sought to provide an Islamic environment for their community's
 
school-age children, not a school for Muslim children where all of
 
their subjects, except religion, are divorced from their Islamic
 
faith. As Sister Ann explains, "It's not that we are trying to pretend
 
that the non-Islamic world doesn't exist, but we'd also like to show
 
our kids that Islam is everywhere. And to let it [
Islam] pervade every
 
aspect of what they are studying." It is this emphasis on an Islamic
 
atmosphere, more than the teaching of unusual or religious subjects,
 
that distinguishes the Islamic School of Seattle. Islamic religion and
 
Arabic classes are part of the curriculum at every level. Formal
 
classes in Qur'an, Islamic studies, and classical Arabic are required
 
23
 
of all students in the kindergarten and grade school-programs. During
 
school hours all children are required to participate in salat, 
taking their places among peers and teachers.
 
Those seeking admission for their children are reminded by the
 
Parent Handbook that at the Islamic School of Seattle (
'i
cation is

that Islam is not only a part of the curriculum but it is the essence

s
 commitment to Islam as a total way of
 
life that provides the framework for the development of the 5cho01's
 
specialized education program designed to meet all the children's
 
needs â€”physical, emotional, educational, and spiritual.
 
There are differences o
f opinion about the importance of specific
 
subject matter and the amount of time given to different subjects,
 
however.  For example, there has been discussion about extending the
 
school day for the older children beginning in 1982-1983. Instruction
 
during the day could then be divided equally between the study of

"To them, of cours

flashlight she and the children portrayed the seasonal changes, talking
 
about their effects
 
on the children's lives. "When the days are longer,
 
I can play outside more," realized Mubarak. '

History of the Islamic School of Seattle
 
From three families and a handful of unmarried students in the
 
early 1
960s,  the Muslim community of Seattle has grown to between 7
,000
 
and 9
,000 persons in the 1980s. The community experienced its greatest
 
growth, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of i
ts
 
school-age children, in the past decade. On February 3
,  1980 a small
 
group of Muslim women
 
first t
ime to found a
 
the Islamic School of
 
parents and educators
 
from the Seattle area met officially for the
 
school for its children. Upon incorporation of
 
Seattle on February 24,  1
980, these Muslim
 
became the Board of Directors.
 
The Parent Handbook, a twelve-page booklet written by the Musi:
 
administrators and distributed to the school's families, articulates
 
the aims of the Islamic education provided by the school. The school's
 
goals are:
 
1
. To provide our children with an atmosphere, as close
 
to the Islamic ideal as possible,  in which they can
 
grow and learn as whole individuals, intellectually,
 
spiritually, and physically.
 
2
. To strengthen them to meet and to effectively deal
 
with the challenges of living in the modern American
 
society.
 
3
. To instill in them a pride in their heritage by
 
enabling them to approach knowledge from a Muslim point
 
of view and by presenting a balanced education with a
s
 
much emphasis on the Muslim world as on the West.
 
2
 
4
. To offer the ultimate in academic excellence so that
 
our children are prepared t
o take an active and
 
dominant role in the world in which they live.
 
5
. To foster lasting fraternal bonds with their Muslim
 
classmates.
 
6
. To enable them to master the Arabic language so t
hat
 
they may have ready access t
o the original sources of
 
Islamic knowledge.
 
The pilot project, a modified Montessori preschool and
 
kindergarten, opened on September 2
,  1980. During its first year the
 
I
slamic School of Seattle shared facilities with the Islamic Center of
 
Seattle, both occupying a house owned by the Islamic Center in the
 
city's south end at 4919 31st Avenue South. Children between the ages
 
of two-and-a-half and five were recruited by the school's founders.
 
They telephoned every Muslim family in Seattle with children in that
 
age range and told them about the new school, urging them to enroll
 
their children. For Ann El -Moslimany, a parent of three teenage
 
children, and the other founders the approach was straightforward:  "We
 
knew all the families in that category." Those contacted responded
 
positively to the solicitations of the school's founders, says S
i r
 
Ann, since "mothers of Muslim children know our children need the
 
support of Muslim peers and Muslim education" to keep them from being
 
pulled in two directions.
 
The success of the school's initial, limited offering provided
 
encouragement and enthusiasm for acquiring an appropriate facility,
 
expanding the existing classes, and extending the program to include
 
3
 
the upper grades. During the spring of 1
981 the school's founders gave
 
serious consideration to the pros and cons of building a school at a
 
new site or buying an older building. They finally located a solidly
 
built, two-story schoolhouse in Seattle's central section. The
 
architecturally impressive structure at 720 25th Avenue, built in 1
930,
 
was first occupied by the Hebrew Academy. In the 1960s the city leased
 
i
t as a public education and youth services facility. During the
 
1970s, however, i
t stood empty, a target for vandals. The building was
 
in sad disrepair when Seattle Muslims purchased i
t for $350,000.
 
"
I was in Kuwait when they called me about finding the building,"
 
recalls Sister Ann.
 
It was a lot of money, all in cash and due in three
 
weeks. I was asked if 1 thought I could raise the
 
money.  I didn't know, but upon talking with a family
 
friend who knew more about these things than I did, it
 
was agreed that I should try. I telephoned back the
 
decision. The deposit of $50,000 was made and we
 
raised what we needed, although it was closer to six
 
weeks by the t
ime all the money was raised and the
 
paperwork done.
 
Before opening for the 1
981-1982 academic year, the school's
 
founders repaired the lovely red tile roof of their new building,
 
painted and put new flooring in two classrooms on the first floor, and
 
made all the changes necessary to comply with city and state health and
 
safe,ty codes. Although professional contractors, some of whom were
 
themselves members of the Muslim community, completed the major
 
structural work, volunteers recruited from among parents, students, and
 
4
 
the Muslim community as a whole pitched in on some of the other tasks.
 
During the 1981-1982 school year yet another group of volunteers
 
renovated a third, larger room for the preschoolers. Repairs and
 
renovations have continued as funds and resources have become
 
available. In addition, community members have regularly donated their
 
skills and materials.  For example, artist Jamshid Kavoussi handpainted
 
verses from the Qur'an in graceful Arabic script at child's-eye level
 
along the building's main hallway and the name "Islamic School of
 
Seattle" in English and Arabic above the large entrance way.
 
In December 1981 the Washington State Board of Education granted
 
full s
tate approval to the preschool and elementary program offered by
 
the Islamic School of Seattle, finding that the school met all fire,
 
health, and safety codes and provided qualified teachers for i
ts
 
classes. At the close of the 1981-1982 school year nearly fifty
 
children between the ages of two-and-a-half and twelve were enrolled in
 
the school's three sections:  the preschool, kindergarten-first grade
 
class, and the through sixth grade class (the latter two classes
 
constituting the school's elementary program).
 
Members of the Muslim community throughout the United States and
 
abroad, especially Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, assisted the
 
Seattle Muslim community with the purchase of the school and have
 
supported its continuing renovation and operation. The Arabic word
 
zakat, which literally means "purification," has no precise English
 
equivalent. It is a Muslim's worship o
f God by me ,ms of h
i
 o
ltL
 
through an obligatory form of giving to those i
n need. Zakat f
unds may
 
also b
e spent in the cause of God for the construction of mosques,
 
religious schools, or hospitals and f
or the salaries of t
hose i
nvolved
 
i
n t he 1
pr o pa g at i o n .
t
ime t
o earn a l

Besides the payment of the obligatory zakat, I
slam also u
rges
 
Muslims t
o give voluntary charity, t
o the extent they can afford, t
o
 
those i
n need. Indeed, charitableness i
s among t
he most s
tressed
 
qualities in Islam. Since Muslims are supposed t
o b

egard their wealth as a
 
trust f
rom God which i
s t
o be used not only for themselves and their
 
families, but for o
ther human beings in need a
s well. The p
roper Muslim
 
attitude i
s set out i

Never will you attain t

most student couples raising a family and going to school, they
 
experience financial constraints. Nonetheless, Sister Jodi assumes her
 
responsibility as a Muslim and designates her zakat to the Islamic
 
School.
 
I
slam is a complete code of life; Muslims must  seek knowledge of
 
the basic tenets of Islam and relate them to all aspects of their
 
individual and social life. In addition, Muslim parents are responsible
 
for the spiritual instruction of their children. The Islamic community
 
has an obligation, therefore, to educate i
ts children in the path of
 
Islam. When the Seattle Muslim community i
s unable to fulfill this
 
responsibility alone, i
t is I
slamically correct for Seattle Muslims to
 
approach the worldwide Muslim community for assistance.  Such an appeal
 
for assistance may not have only monetary results.  Husein Saleh, the
 
Arabic teacher in the grade school program, i
s teaching in response to
 
a sense of obligation. "I am not trained in teaching Arabic," he says.
 
"My wife is a linguist and she has helped me prepare many of the
 
materials. My training and interest is in many fields. For example, I
 
have my master's in urban planning. But, it is my obligation to teach
 
Arabic. Each day I ask if they have found another teacher. How can I
 
not teach the students Arabic? It i
s our language of our religion. It
 
is my duty."
 
To meet i
ts f
inancial obligations the I
slamic School o
f S
eattle
 
has relied heavily on donations from Muslim individuals and
 
organizations. The school has encouraged individuals and groups t
o plan
 
fund-raising activities. It also charges its s
tudents tuition. In
 
addition, the school has initiated educational p
rojects that will
 
provide income and has begun planning for an endowment fund t
o ensure
 
i
ts financial well-being and continuation.
 
8
 
Two other local Muslim organizations â€”the Islamic Center of
 
Seattle and the Muslim Students' Association, University of Washington
 
Chapter â€”have also subsidized the school in the past. The Islamic
 
Center provided the school's first home in 1980-1981 and substantial
 
loans when the school's present building was purchased in March 1
981.
 
Currently,  the vice-president of the Officers of the Corporation, one
 
of the school's two governing bodies, is also the Islamic Center's
 
president. Recently the center held a summer camp benefit in the school
 
gymnasium. In September, just as the school was opening in i
ts new
 
building,  the local branch of the Muslim Students' Association
 
contributed $9,000 to the school's scholarship fund.
 
During the 1
981-1982 academic year the school collected tuition
 
from all children enrolled in each of the ten-week instructional
 
quarters according t
o the following formula:

The school required tuition payments in full by the end of the third
 
week of any quarter, although deferred payment contracts were
 
available. Families with financial hardship are eligible for partial
 
tuition reductions through the scholarship fund, a limited resource
 
which i
s dependent upon donations designated for this purpose. While
 
the school's administrators hoped that tuition would cover the salaries
 
of the instructional staff (excluding medical insurance payments),  in
 
actuality such revenue rarely covered more than one-third of that cost
 
in 1981-1982. The school also offered daycare for any child from 7

School Administration
 
The administration and governance of the school is handled by two
 
separate, but related, entities: The Board of Directors and the
 
Officers of the Corporation, referred to somewhat confusingly  as "
the
 
board." Members of the Board of Directors helped to raise funds from
 
the Muslim community to start the school and remain the overseers of
 
the school's assets. Four Muslim women â€”Zain Ubaidullah, Ann
 
El -Moslimany, Rafia Khokhar, and Suzette Kakar--have been members of
 
the Board of Directors.
. since February 1980. In addition, because the
 
school wants to remain responsive to the community it serves, it has
 
selected an an administrative board, the officers of the Corporation,
 
1
0
 
from interested community members. The administrative board meets
 
weekly to establish future policies, establish priorities, and consider
 
day-to-day problems. It is in charge of all personnel, curriculum, and
 
budget matters, as well as building plans. Board members consult with
 
the school's teaching s
taff on a monthly basis and with other
 
individuals as needed. Currently, six individuals are serving on the
 
b
oard: Abdul-Raouf Mannaa, (president), Faizullah Kakar
 
(vice-president), Suzette Kakar (secretary), Ann El-Moslimany
 
(fund-raising chairman abroad), Abdullah Abduljabbar, and Mohammad
 
El-Moslimany. The position of treasurer, formerly occupied by Abdalla
 
Shamia, is vacant; those duties are currently being handled by the
 
board as a whole.
 
The schools' administrative or office personnel staff currently
 
includes two positions. Diana Akhgar was hired in December 1981 as
 
administrative secretary, to take charge of the day-to-day, on-site
 
needs of the school in conjunction with the Officers of the
 
Corporation. Decisions about the misbehavior of a child, the taking of
 
class photographs, and the work of a particular contractor are all
 
considered during the weekly meetings of the board. Daily concerns
 
considered during the weekly meeting may effectively crowd out those
 
that are less immediate. Time that might be spent in profitable
 
discussion of long-range goals such as the securing of contributions to
 
establish an endowment, fund can easily be diverted by hearing about an
 
isolated classroom incident involving one or two children. Because
 
there is as yet no individual at the school with the authority t
o make
 
1
1
 
decisions and carry out policy on daily basis, there is considerable
 
i
titude for administrative confusion and breakdowns in communication
 
tween and among teachers, staff, parents, children, and community
 
members. Consequently, when the school reopens in September 1
982 the
 
board hopes to have secured an administrator who would have such
 
authority and yet remain responsible and accountable to board members.
 
Irene Junejo has been driving the school's econoline van s
ince the
 
Islamic School of Seattle opened two years ago. She is employed
 
directly by a group of parents to provide transportation for their
 
children along an established route. In addition, Sister Irene drives
 
the van on school field trips such as the hayride at the Aqua Barn &
 
School for the preschoolers in May and provides transportation for
 
those in the school's new Women's English Program. The custodial or
 
service personnel staff has three members. Mohamath Toulas, father of
 
two of the older grade school children, is the school's custodian.
 
Mohammad Javaharian and Yaghoub Ebrahimi occupy small,  remodeled rooms
 
in the school's basement in exchange for carrying out the
 
responsibilities of security personnel.
 
The employment of these individuals is not insignificant, indeed,
 
a recent fundâ€”raising "news update" called attention to it: "An
 
important spinâ€”off of the school has been the jobs which we have been
 
able to provide to Muslims from within the Seattle community." At the
 
time of that newsletter Muslim employees included "two preschool
 
teachers, one elementary teacher's aid, one Arabic teacher, one
 
1
2
 
secretary, one director of the Women's English Program, one school bus
 
driver, and one custodian." The newsletter also points out that
 
employment at the school offers special benefits to two specific
 
groups. "Muslim women who find it necessary t
o work are now spared the
 
difficulties of working in a non-Islamic environment" and members of
 
political refugee groups with limited knowledge of English and of
 
American society and culture who need to support their families, can
 
work within a more "supportive and familiar environment."
 
Parents
 
The school's Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) schedules one
 
Saturday afternoon meeting a month at the school. Children take home
 
announcements of these meetings, and parents are encouraged t
o attend
 
to get t
o know the other parents and their children's teachers.
 
Meetings of the school's PTA are chaired by a president elected by the
 
parents. Other officers include secretary,  treasurer, publications
 
officer, and bazaar chairperson.
 
The agenda for the January 30,  1982 meeting included:
 
transportation, the new Arabic teacher, the new elementary school
 
teacher, the new preschool directoress and room, the school's recent
 
accreditation, upcoming PTA elections, and fund raising. During the
 
1
3
 
school year the PTA's Parents Committee held a series of rummage sales,
 
raising more than $
1,000 toward the purchase of playground equipment.
 
Participation in the
 
to fifteen percent of the
 
by other PTA groups. With
 
PTA has been estimated at approximately t
en
 
parents, a level comparable to that achieved
 
under fifty s
tudents in the school and
 
several families sending more than one, even universal participation
 
would not produce more than a handful o
f active PTA members, however.
 
Moreover, since many of the school's families come from non-Western
 
countries and are often uncomfortable speaking English, the involvement
 
in their children's education and the participatory role expected of
 
them as parents is still unfamiliar. Nonetheless, the Parent Handbook
  
emphasizes parental involvement: "We believe a child's learning
 
experience is complete when the school and home make a cooperative
 
effort. The school and the home are extensions of one another; our
 
interests are the same, so our actions need be also."
 
Teachers
 
The Islamic School's teaching staff changed frequently during the
 
1981-1982 academic year. Between December 1981 and April 1982 five
 
individuals joined the full-time faculty, bringing the tot al f
icu1tv r
 
seven. The teaching staff of the school includes:
 
(
1) Mrs. Ruth Crum, director of the elementary school program and
 
teacher of grades two through six, who became a member of the school's
 
faculty in December 1
981. She holds a B
.A.  from Seattle University and
 
1
4
 
certification from the state of Washington at the elementary and high
 
school levels. She taught for twenty years within the Bellevue
 
[
Washington] School District. Most recently Mrs. Crum spent a year in
 
Peru and three years in Yemen,  teaching primarily English -a
s-a-second--
Language (ESL) in local schools.
 
(
2) Mrs. Carol Thorne, kindergarten-first grade teacher, was
 
hired in April 1982. She earned her B
.A.  from the University of
 
Washington, Seattle, specializing in elementary education. Before
 
coming to the Islamic School Mrs. Thorne taught for several years in a
 
suburban Roman Catholic school and was a substitute teacher for the
 
city of Seattle.
 
(
3) Ummil Khair Ishfaaq joined the s
taff as director and t
eacher
 
of the preschool in December 1981. Sister Uminil earned her A.A. in
 
early childhood education from Seattle Central Community College.
 
Before joining the faculty she operated a successful Montessori
 
preschool program in her home. It was the first Muslim preschool in
 
Seattle â€”
predating the efforts of the Islamic School of Seattle â€”and
 
many children attended the school specifically for the Islamic
 
atmosphere that Sister Ummil created.
 She is currently  taking
 
additional Montessori classes during the summer at a local
 
college with the financial assistance of the Officers of tL
 
Corporation.
 
(
4) Husein Saleh, Arabic teacher for the elementary school
 
program, has been at the school since January 1982. Untrained in
 
foreign language t
eaching, he draws upon his own experiences in
 
learning English as a second language and his wife's expertise as a
 
linguist in preparing his lessons. Brother Husein, who is a native
 
speaker of Arabic, came to the United States from Jordan four years ago
 
to s
tudy for an M
.A. in urban planning at the University of Oklahoma.
 
(5) Muhammad Nasser Jappee, preschool Arabic teacher, joined the
 
faculty in May 1982. A native of South Africa, he learned Arabic as a
 
student in Saudi Arabia. Before coming to Seattle he taught Arabic to
 
English-speaking students in Johannesburg, South Africa. In addition to
 
Arabic language instruction, Brother Muhammad has taught calligraphy on
 
occasion to the school's second through sixth grade students, and he
 
has also assisted Samia El-Mosliinany in teaching them Arabic songs for
 
the Islamic Center Camp benefit.
 
(6) Azhar Ibrahim, teacher's aid in the preschool, is the only
 
member of the present faculty to have started in September 1981, when
 
the Islamic School of Seattle opened for its second year. Sister Azhar,
 
who J
ias an M.A. in Persian studies, i
s frequently called upon to share
 
her knowledge of relig.ton, the Qur'an, and Islamic history and culture.
 
(7) Mary Abdi, who is a teacher's aid in the elementary school
 
classes, became a member of the teaching staff in November 1
981. She i
s
 
an undergraduate student in anthropology at the University of
 
Washington, Seattle and has a special interest in elementary education.

Sister Mary works with Mrs. Crum and Mrs. Thorne, assisting with
 
reading groups, homework assignments, and review exercises while the
 
teachers work with the other students. More recently,  Sister Mary has
 
been conducting social studies and religion classes.
 
The faculty is paid on a monthly basis, according to the following
 
schedule: director of the elementary school, $1,111; director of the
 
preschool, $700; kindergarten-first grade teacher, $
700; and
 
teaching assistants and Arabic teachers,  $4.75 per hour.
 
Volunteers from Seattle's Muslim community augment the t
eaching
 
staff. For example, Samia El-Moslimany, a college student and daughter
 
of Sister Ann, has been teaching Islamic art and music classes in the
 
elementary school program. Sister Jodi has recently begun assisting
 
with reading and special reviews in the kindergarten-first grade c
lass.
 
Also, before her marriage and subsequent move to Indiana last  I
 
Zainab Ubaidullah, a member of the Board of Directors and i
t
 
"Perpetual President," taught religion to the elementary schou
 
students.
 
Children
 
When the 1981-1982 school year ended on June 1
1,  1982, forty-seven
 
children between the ages of two-and-a-half and twelve were enrolled in
 
the three classes: preschool, twenty-three; kindergarten-first grade,
 
ten; and second through sixth grade, fourteen. Boys outnumbered girls,
 
but not by much. More than two dozen families were sending their
 
1
6
 
Children to the Islamic School of Seattle. These families represented
 
at least six different ethnic or national backgrounds and spoke as many
 
native languages. Some of the families are in the United States only
 
temporarily, planning to return home when a job or degree i
s finished.
 
For others America has become their new hone. Perhaps a quarter of the
 
children were from black or Afroâ€”American fam: :
 1
 
children and their families have in common?  Th
 t
 
the pride in calling themselves Muslim, and the desire to learn Arabic,
 
the language of their faith.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
The preschool curriculum includes Arabic, primarily vocabulary
 
building; preâ€”reading and preâ€”mathematics (sometimes using Montessori
 
equipment); physical activity (organized games and free play in the
 
gymnasium or outdoors); and religion (memorization of Qur'anic verses
 
and discussion of I
slamic manners, including stories of the prophets).
 
Preschoolers regularly participate in the daily requirements of their
 
faith: the teachers instruct, help, and show them through example "to
 
make wudu'  (wash) in preparation for salat (prayer or worship). While
 
the children usually have salat in their own classroom, they often go
 
to the gymnasium to participate in prayer along with the older
 
children, faculty members and staff, women enrolled in the Women's
 
English Program, and Muslim visitors to the school.
 
1
7
 
The curriculum f
or the elementary school program includes Arabic
 
reading, writing, and conversation; spelling; religion;  I
slamic art and
 
music; and social studies from an Islamic viewpoint. Not all of these
 
subjects are taught every day. During the final quarter the second
 
through sixth graders travelled to the library on Tuesday afternoons,
 
studied Islamic art on Wednesday afternoons, and learned Islamic music
 
on Thursdays. The kindergarten-first grade had a similar schedule:
 
social studies from an Islamic viewpoint Wednesday afternoons and
 
handwriting on Thursday afternoons.
 
The elementary school children also have regular periods for
 
religious activity. Each school day opens with the recitation of the
 
Fatiha (
introduction t
o prayer). Later in the morning teachers devote
 
time to helping children memorize Qur'anic verses through collective
 
and individual recitation. The afternoon instruction includes wudu and
 
salat, often with one of the older b
oys serving as the imam or leader
 
of the service.
 
The t
ime scheduled for each subject or group of subjects varies.
 
For example,  the daily religion class in the kindergarten-first grac
 
is a half hour, while religion class lasts twenty minutes each day for
 
the second through sixth grade group. Wudu and salat add another forty
 
minutes to the time set aside in the afternoon for Islamic practices.
 
Generally,  the time periods in the elementary school range from thirty
 
to seventy-five minutes. Arabic instruction takes up at least
 
1
8
 
thirty-five minutes of each school day, excluding the time spent on the
 
language as part of the daily religion class, salat, Fatiha, and surah
  
recitation (a surah i
s a chapter, part,  or book of the Qu'ran).
 
Moreover, during the 1
981-1982 school year the scheduling of subjects
 
changed t
o reflect alterations in teaching staff and volunteers,
 
availability of audio-visual materials and equipment, and concerns
 
raised by Muslim parents or board members.
 
Some of the curriculum materials come from major publishers in the
 
United States. The social studies texts are published by MacMillan as
 
part of their series Places Near and Far. Other texts are donated by
 
Muslim countries through their official government or educational
 
channels. For instance, the Saudi Arabian Educational Mission to the
 
United States contributed Arabic-language textbooks. In addition,  the
 
school uses texts developed, published, and distributed by Muslims
 
through their own publishing concerns, bookstores, and organizations.
 
For example, the Islamic Foundation of Leicester, England produces The
 
Muslim Children's Library, a series of small, well produced books to
 
help a Muslim child "develop a fresh faith, a dynamic commitment, a
 
strong identity, and a throbbing yearning and urge to struggle â€”all
 
rooted in Islam." The preschool uses Muslim Nursery Rhymes, Assalamu
  
Alaikuni (Peace
/e with
 and several other books from the series.
 
The six members.of the administrative board currently establish
 
and supervise the curriculum, but certified teachers and trained
 
educator-administrators who have accepted Islam may be given more
 
1
9
 
authority over curriculum development in the future. Due t
o the lack of
 
such trained Muslim personnel at the present time, however, these tasks
 
have been the responsibility of the board members. In establishing the
 
school curriculum they have sought advice from certified teachers and
 
other educators outside the Muslim faith, examined curriculum l
ibraries
 
in this country and abroad, and considered undertaking their own
 
publishing program. The first book, tentatively expected t
o b
e
 
available in October 1982, will be a combination workbook and reader
 
for the grade school children who are not native speakers of Arabic.
 
Board members feel this book and others planned for the series could
 
also be used profitably to teach Arabic to young, native speakers of
 
the language, however.  Once this project is successfully underway, at
 
least one member of the board would like to see the publishing venture
 
expanded to include social studies texts and other materials.
 
In emphasizing the need f
or such publications, Ann El-Moslimany
 
remarks, "Maybe thirty percent of the countries the children will be
 
studying are Muslim countries, and they are always presented badi.
 
always. I
've never, ever, ever looked at a textbook that presented a
 
Muslim country in a way that I felt was fair." How could social studies
 
lessons that are unbiased be incorporated into Arabic readers? "We feel
 
that we could use characters, especially,  that the children in our
 
school, or other schools--there are other Islamic schools in the
 
U.S. â€”would identify with," responds Sister Ann. "Children who have,
 
maybe, Pakistani origin, who go back to visit Pakistan. And this is a
 
good place to show what these children would see in Pakistan, what ways
 
20
 
they would see that are different from what they do in the U.S. And we
 
could do i
t with various nationalities â€”just have a few of these
 
children as the characters in the book." In addition to providing books
 
for their own and other Islamic schools â€”Western-style books,
 
incorporating illustrations and other stimulating and interesting
 
presentation techniques â€”the venture should also return profits
 
directly to the school fund.
 
The school provides the textbooks and the children purchase their
 
own workbooks. Earlier in the year  Iftah Ya Sem Sem (open sesame), an
 
Arabic version of the popular children's program Sesame Street,
 
assisted teachers t
o present Arabic instruction. Produced in Kuwait,
 
the program made Arabic more accessible to to the preschoolers, while
 
making the Arabic-speaking children feel a bit more at home, since the
 
program contained familiar sights, sounds, and people. When Mrs. Crum
 
joined the teaching staff as director of the elementary school and
 
teacher of kindergarten through sixth grade (later, second through
 
sixth grades), she initiated the weekly walks to the public branch
 
library just a few blocks from the school. A bookmobile regularly
 
visits the school so that Unnnil Khair Ishfaaq, director of the
 
preschool, can select appropriate books for her children
 
All of the teachers rely on handouts to reinforce their lessons.
 
For example, Brother }
Lusein prepares sheets with pictures of familiar
 
animals and objects, followed by the Arabic name, leaving a space for
 
the children to practice writing the correct identification. Sister
 
2
1
 
Mary found that the children in the kindergarten-first grade group
 
remembered and understood the topic of a religion class better when she
 
included a supporting exercise such as a worksheet to complete or an
 
assignment to "draw and color what we have been talking about." Later,
 
several of these sheets were assembled in a religious booklet made by
 
the children as part of a religion class project. Mrs. Crum and Mrs.
 
Thorne rely on similar handouts, as well as on colored construction
 
paper, recycled computer printouts, and other assorted materials to
 
encourage the children and s
timulate their imagination. Due t
o limited
 
resources,  the teachers and the children have had to be creative.  In
 
the preschool Sister Ummjl has introduced the children to
 
"manipulatives" associated with the Montessori method of instruction.
 
She has also encouraged the children to explore the objects in t
he
 
classroom and has played "word bingo"  t
o increase their vocabulary
 
skills.
 
The children are tested and graded on a regular basis. The school
 
year is divided into four quarters and report cards are distributed to
 
the parents at a scheduled parent-teacher conference held at the end of
 
each quarter. Each "card" is actually an 8 1/2 x 14-inch, five-page,
 
pressure-sensitive form. This format permits a quarterly report and
 
permanent record of the academic (reading, language arts, spelling,
 
handwriting, mathematics, social studies, science, Arabic languag
 
religion, art, and mus-ic) and personal (
"listens  attentively,"
 
"follows directions," "shows respect for authority," and "works
 
independently") development of each child. An evaluation of the effort
 
22
 
expended by the child i
s also possible, since teachers have space under
 
each academic subject to indicate how they compare the child's effort
 
to his or her own ability. The card also shows the "achievement grade,"
 
which compares the child's achievement with other students at the same
 
grade level. The "key" or ranking procedure is the same for both effort
 
and achievement:  "good," "satisfactory," and "needs improvement." At
 
the bottom of the grade form is a space for teachers'  comments and a
 
place t
o indicate promotion or grade assignment. Each teacher who works
 
with the child fills in the appropriate i
tems, giving an evaluation of
 
the child's work during the quarter. Parents and teachers are may
 
request a conference at any time during the year. Interpreters are
 
often present during such conferences whenever a language problem might
 
arise.
 
Purposes of the School
 
The founders and the administrators of the Islamic School of
 
Seattle have sought to provide an Islamic environment for their
 
community's school-age children, not a school for Muslim children where
 
all of their subjects, except religion, are divorced from their Islamic
 
faith. As Sister Ann explains, "It's not that we are trying to pretend
 
that the non-Islamic world doesn't exist, but we'd also like to show
 
our kids that Islam is everywhere. And to let it [
Islam] pervade every
 
aspect of what they are studying." I
t i
s this emphasis on an Islamic
 
23
 
atmosphere, more than the teaching of unusual or religious subjects,
 
that distinguishes the Islamic School of Seattle. Islamic religion and
 
Arabic classes are part of the curriculum at every level. Formal
 
classes in Qur'an, Islamic studies, and classical Arabic are required
 
of all s
tudents in the elementary school program. During school hours
 
all children participate in salat,  taking their places among peers and
 
teachers.
 
Those seeking admission for their children are reminded by the
 
Parent Handbook that a
t the Islamic School of Seattle "education i
s
 
provided within an Islamic framework, and parents should bear in mind
 
that I
slam is not only a part of the curriculum, but it is the essence
 
of the school's being." It is this comm itment to Islam as a total way
 
of life that provides the framework for the development of the school's
 
specialized education program designed to meet all the children's
 
needs--physical, emotional, educational, and spiritual.
 
There are differences of opinion about the importance of specific
 
subject matter and the amount of time spent on different subjects,
 
however. For example, there has been discussion about extending the
 
school day for the older children beginning in 1
982-1983. Instruction
 
during the day could then be divided equally between the study of
 
Arabic and the study of English subjects. The school board members
 
anticipate resistance to such a change from the two non-Muslim
 
teachers. "To them, of course, this isn't so important.  I
 
mean, they can't see the importance; but i
t i
s important, and it's our
 
24
 
school," explains Sister Ann. For their part, the non -Muslim t
eachers
 
fully support the religious premise of the school, finding i
t
 
compatible with their own deeply held Christian beliefs. The non-Muslim
 
teachers are,  nonetheless, concerned about the amount of time allotted
 
to "the basics"--the core courses required by the Washington State
 
Department of Education â€”for which, as certified teachers, they are
 
directly responsible.
 
Yet, even in teaching these basic subjects, both teachers
 
consciously attempt t
o include religious principles and the presence of
 
Allah in their lessons and in their interaction with the children.
 
During a morning science class, for instance, Mrs. Crum helped her
 
second through sixth grade class understand the earth's rotation on its
 
axis, the planet's movement around the sun, and the relationship of
 
these activities to day, night, and seasonal changes. Using a globe and
 
flashlight she and the children portrayed the seasonal changes, talking
 
about their effects on the children's lives. "When the days are longer,
 
I can play outside more," realized Mubarak. "The timne for salat
 
changes," recalled Rohymah. Then, bringing an interesting and
 
informative science lesson to a close, Mrs. Crum reminded the children
 
that such things are not an accicent but "part of Allah's plan."
 
Still,  the ranking order of the important subjects and the
 
allocation of time to -
different classes remain potentially serious
 
areas for misunderstanding, even conflict. To be a well-educated Muslim
 
one has to know Arabic. Although the "total immersion" Arabic-language
 
2
5
 
plan for the preschool is as yet unrealized, and the "truly b
ilingual,
 
Arabic-English" elementary school program has not been established,  the
 
board remains commmitted to those programs to generate Arabic fluency
 
among the Muslim children. During the final quarter of the 1981-1982
 
school year board members supported some changes in the t
eaching day to
 
accomodate more Islam in the subject areas, particularly in those
 
associated with the humanities and social sciences. Samia El-Mosliivany
 
began coming to the school in the afternoons to lead the classes in art
 
and music, emphasizing Islamic influences, characteristeics, and
 
appreciation.  In one art project the elementary school children
 
paracticed calligraphy, writing the name "Allah" and then braiding
 
colored streamers to paste onto the decorative handwriting. Mary Abdi,
 
an assistant in the elementary program, assumed full responsibility for
 
the social studies portion of the curriculum during the same quarter.
 
On Fridays Sister Mary would often present social studies from an
 
Islamic perspective, focusing on a different country from the Muslim
 
world each week.
 
The children aged seven t
o twelve in Mrs. Crum's class know why
 
they go t
o the Islamic School of Seattle: their parents send them. They
 
are also quite certain why their parents want them to go:  "Here I am
 
with other Muslims." "At this school I am able to pray." "I can learn
 
Arabic. I can learn to be a good Muslim." "The teachers here are good.
 
They are Muslims, like. me." The response to my question,  "What classes
 
do you like the most?" was immediate and unanimous â€”"Arabic!" In our
 
conversations several children suggested other favorites, for example,
 
26
 
recess. This response prompted delighted giggles f
rom other classmates
 
who were vainly t
rying to be serious while being recorded by their
 
now familiar visitor. This distraction aside, the children focused upon
 
those subjects unique to their school:  studying Arabic, memorizing
 
Qur'anic verses, and working on Islamic art projects. Eager t
o show me
 
how much Arabic they had learned and to hear their voices on the tape,
 
many of the children volunteered estimates of the size of h
is or her
 
Arabic vocabulary.
 
As to why they l
ike studying Arabic, Lawrence, an eight-year-old
 
boy quite new to the school responded: "
IL like Arabic because Allah
 
made this kind of language." Do they practice Arabic at home? "Yes,
 
i
t's the language of our religion," several stressed.
 
All but two of the children now enrolled in the elementary school
 
program had attended one or more schools before coming to the Islamic
 
School of Seattle. Consequently, many of them could offer comparisons
 
of their experience in those schools with that of being a student at
 
the Islamic School. "At this school we learn English," said Ibrahim, a
 
boy who previously attended a school in Saudi Arabia. Mubarak, an
 
Afro-American, emphasized that at the Islamic School he knew that he
 
would receive "right lessons.' Rohynak, a Chain refugee from Southeast
 
Asia and the oldest girl in the class, observed quietly:  "We come to
 
learn to be good Muslims."
 
2
7
 
For most of the c
hildren school hours provide virtually the only
 
t
ime t
o see one another. With the exception of the Chains, who have
 
largely been settled t
ogether in city-owned apartment buildings in
 
Seattle, and some of the families residing in university or college
 
housing units, most of the children and their families are scattered
 
throughout Seattle. One family lives in suburban Kent, necessitating a
 
t
rip of sixty miles each day by car so the children can attend school.
 
Several of the children participate in "Sunday school" at the mosque,
 
learning Arabic and religion in classes with some of their c
lassmates.
 
There they are joined by other Muslim children who are not students at
 
the I
slamic school of Seattle. Although there i
s no official
 
relationship between the mosque school and the Islamic school, many o
f
 
the same people are involved in both. For instance, Sister Samia
 
teaches Arabic to the children in the mosque school on Sundays,
 
In the final analysis how do the children feel about attending the
 
Islamic School of Seattle? Certainly, they are glad to be there. During
 
one discussion Jamilla and her younger brother Ibrahim both spoke
 
excitedly about the school, saying, "a few more weeks and we'll b
e off
 
probation." Referring to the official trial period of six weeks for all
 
new students, they were literally counting the days until the school
 
would be truly theirs. "Just sixteen more days and we'll be real
 
students!" Jamilla enthusiastically reminded her brother. Asking the
 
children to help me understand what attending the Islamic School of
 
28
 
Seattle means to theta, I suggested that they attempt to think how each
 
of them might describe their school t
o a new child, a child of their
 
own age, coming t
o the school for the f
irst t

Jamilla:
 "Coming t

corning t

 "We're Muslims and they're not, but we can
 
still teach them to be good Muslims."

heads, so they would be comfortable."
 
History of the Islamic School of Seattle
 
From three families and a handful of unmarried students in the
 
early 1
960s, the Muslim community of Seattle has grown to between 7
,000
 
and 9
,000 persons in the 1980s. The community experienced its greatest
 
growth, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of i
ts
 
school-age children, in the past decade. On February 3
,  1980 a small
 
group of Muslim women from the Seattle area met officially for the
 
first time t
o found a schooT f._

parents and educators became the Board of Directors.
 
The Parent Handbook, a twelve-page booklet written by the Muslim
 
administrators and distributed to the school's families, articulates
 
the aims of the Islamic education provided by the school. The school's
 
goals are:
 
I
. To provide our children with an atmosphere, as close
 
" -
,
*"
t
o the Islamic ideal as possible,  in which they can
 
grow and learn as whole individuals, intellectually,
 
spiritually, and physically.
 
2
. To strengthen them to meet and to effectively deal
 
V  with the challenges of living in the modern American
 
society.
 
3
. To instill in them a pride in their heritage by
 
//enabling them to approach knowledge from a Muslim point
 
of view and by presenting a balanced education with as
 
much emphasis on the Muslim world as on the West.
 
2
 
4
. To offer the ultimate in academic excellence so that
 
/ our children are prepared t
o take an active and
 
dominant role in the world in which they live.
 
/ 5
. To foster lasting fraternal bonds with their Muslim
 
classmates.
 
6
. To enable them to master the Arabic language so that
 
they may have ready access t
o the original sources of
 
I
slamic knowledge.
 
The pilot project, a modified Montessori preschool and
 
kindergarten, opened on September 2
,  1980. During its first year the
 
I
slamic School of Seattle shared facilities with the Islamic Center of
 
Seattle, both occupying a house owned by the Islamic Center in the
 
city's south end at 4919 3
1st Avenue South. Children between the ages
 
of two-and-a-half and five were recruited by the school's founders.
 
They telephoned every Muslim family in Seattle with children in that
 
age range and told them about the new school, urging them to enroll
 
their children. For Ann El-Moslimany, a parent of three teenage
 
children, and the other founders the approach was straightforward:  "We
 
knew all the families in that category." Those contacted responded
 
positively to the solicitations of the school's founders, says Sister
 
Ann, since "mothers of Muslim children know our children need the
 
support of Muslim peers and Muslim education" to keep them from being
 
pulled in two directions.
 
The success of the school's initia

encouragement and enthusiasm for acquiring an appropriate facility,
 
expanding the existing classes, and extending the program to include
 
3
 
t
rie upper grades. During the spring of 1
981 the school's founders gave
 
serious consideration to the pros and cons of building a school at a
 
new site or buying an older building. They finally located a solidly
 
built, two-story schoolhouse in Seattle's central section. The
 
architecturally impressive structure at 720 25th Avenue, built in 1
930,
 
was first occupied by the Hebrew Academy. In the 1960s the city leased
 
i
t as a public education and youth services facility. During the
 
1
970s, however,  it stood empty, a target for vandals. The building was
 
in sad disrepair when Seattle Muslims purchased i
t for $350,000.
 
"
I was in Kuwait when they called me about finding the building,"
 
recalls Sister Ann.
 
It was a lot of money, all in cash 
,and due in three
 
weeks. I was asked if I thought I could raise the
 
money.  I didn't know, but upon talking with a family
 
friend who knew more about these things than I did, i
t
 
was agreed that I should try. I telephoned back the
 
decision. The deposit of $50,000 was made and we
 
raised what we needed, although it was closer to six
 
weeks by the time all the money was raised and the
 
paperwork done.
 
Before opening for the 1
981-1982 academic year, the school's
 
founders repaired the lovely red tile roof of their new building,
 
painted and put new flooring in two classrooms on the first floor,
 
made all the changes necessary to comply with city and state health and
 
safety codes. Although professional contractors, some of whom were
 
themselves members of the Muslim community, completed the major
 
structural work, volunteers recruited from among parents, students, and
 
the Muslim community as a whole pitched in on some of the other t
asks.
 
During the 1981-1982 school year yet another group of volunteers
 
renovated a third, larger room for the preschoolers. Repairs and
 
renovations have continued as funds and resources have become
 
available. In addition, community members have regularly donated their
 
skills and materials.  For example, artist Jamshid Kavoussi handpainted
 
verses from the Sur'an  n graceful Arabic script at child's-eye level
 
along the building's main hallway and the name "Islamic School of
 
Seattle" in English and Arabic above the large entrance way.
 
In December 1981 the Washington State Board of Education granted
 
full s
tate approval to the preschool and elementary program 
Soffered by
 
the Islamic School of Seattle, finding that the school met all fire,
 
health, and safety codes and provided qualified teachers for i
ts
 
classes. At the close of the 1981-1982 school year nearly fifty
 
children between the ages of
 
the school's three sections:
 
two-and-a-half and twelve were enrolled in
 
the preschool, kindergarten-first grade
 
t-
class, and the through sixth grade clas;

through an obligatory form of giving to those in need. Zakat funds may
 
also be spent in the cause of God for the construction of mosques,
 
religious schools, or hospitals and for the salaries of those involved
 
in the propagation or study of Islam whose work keeps them from having
 
t
ime t
o earn a livelihood.
 
Besides the payment of the obligatory zakat, I
slam also urges
 
Muslims t
o give voluntary charity, to the extent they can afford, to
 
those in need. Indeed, charitableness is among the most stressed
 
qualities in Islam. Since Muslims are supposed to be always
 
responsive t
o human need and distress, Muslims regard their wealth as a
 
trust from God which i
s to be used not only for themselves and their
 
families, but for other human beings in need as well. The proper Muslim
 
attitude i
s set out in the
 
/
 
Never will you attain to the highest degree of virtue unless
 
you spend in the cause of Allah out of that which you
 
love; and whatever you spend, Allah surely knows it
 
well.
 (3:93)
 
They also ask thee what shall they spend. Tell them:
 
Whatever is spare. (2:220)1
 
Consequently, donations that have been made to the Islamic School
 
of Seattle must be understood not as the largess of wealthy individuals
 
but as an act of worship required of all Muslims in the practice of
 
their faith. For example, Jodi Shahabi, a volunteer at the school, and
 
her husband are students at the University of Washington. They have a

small daughter who will attend the preschool in September 1
982. Like
 
most student couples raising a family and going to school, they
 
experience financial constraints. Nonetheless, Sister Jodi assumes h
er
 
responsibility as a Muslim and designates her zakat to the Islamic
 
School.
 
I
slam is a complete code of life; Muslims must seek knowlec
i
 
the basic tenets of Islam and relate them to all aspects of the
 
individual and social life. In addition, Muslim parents are responsible
 
for the spiritual instruction of their children. The Islamic community
 
has an obligation, therefore, to educate its children in the path of
 
Islam. When the Seattle Muslim community is unable to fulfill this
 
responsibility alone, i
t is Islamically correct for Seattle Muslims to
 
approach the worldwide Muslim community for assistance. Such an appeal
 
for assistance may not have only monetary rocult
-g-.,  Husein Saleh, the
 
Arabic teacher in the grade school program,  is teaching in response to
 
a sense of obligation.  .
I am not trained in teaching Arabic," he says.
 
"My wife is a linguist and she has helped me prepare many of the
 
materials. :
M
t
 raining and interest is in many fields. For example, I
 
have my master's in urban planning. But, it is my obligation to teach
 
Arabic. Each day I ask if they have found another teacher. How can I
 
not teach the students Arabic? It i
s our language of our religion. It
 
is my duty."
 
7
 
To meet its financial obligations the Islamic School of Seattle
 
has relied heavily on donations from Muslim individuals and
 
organizations. The school has encouraged individuals and groups t
o plan
 
fund-raising activities. It also charges its students tuition. In
 
addition, the school has initiated educational projects that will
 
provide income and has begun planning for an endowment fund t
o ensure
 
its financial well-being and continuation.
 
In addition to monetary donations, offers of supplies and
 
volunteer labor from Muslim parents, students, and community members
 
have frequently helped stretch funds even further. A community-wide
 
effort was put forth to shape up the new school building for the first
 
day of class last September, and a similar effort readied the new
 
preschool room for its February opening. In addition, members of the
 
community have aided the school over and over again by donating needed
 
items. "Twice our needs have been met even before we asked," notes
 
school secretary Dia
 
the very day that we had to place an
 
order for additional tables and chairs for the classroom, Brother Sami
 
Amin, who deals in salvage, called to tell us he had two hundred to
 
donate. On another occasion we decided to announce at Juma'  [
Friday]
 
Prayer service that we needed tricycles and other riding toys. Before
 
the announcement was made we were presented with several such toys from
 
a family who was moving. Allah is the knower of all things!"

building, the local branch of the Muslim Students' Association
 
contributed $9,000 to the school's scholarship fund.
 
During the 1981-1982 academic year the school collected tuition
 
from all children enrolled in each of the ten-week instructional
 
quarters according to the following formula:

The school required tuition payments in full by the end of the third
 
week of any quarter, although deferred payment contracts were
 
available. Families with financial hardship are eligible for partial
 
tuition reductions through the scholarship fund, a limited resource
 
which i
s dependent upon donations designated for this purpose. While
 
the school's administrators hoped that tuition would cover the salaries
 
of the instructional staff (excluding medical insurance payments),  in
 
actuality such revenue rarely covered more than one-third of that cost
 
in 1981-1982. The school also offered daycare for any child from 7

School Administration

separate, but related, entities: The Board of Directors and the
 
Officers of the Corporatio
 
board.2 Members of the Board of Directors helped to raise funds -

budget matters, as well as building plans. Board members consult with
 
the school's teaching staff on a monthly basis and with other
 
individuals as needed. Currently, six individuals are serving on the

(vice-president), Suzette Kakar (secretary), Ann El-Moslimany

fund-raising chairman abroad), Abdullah Abduijabbar, and Mohammad
 
El-Moslimany. The position of treasurer, formerly occupied by Abdalla
 
Shamia, is vacant; those duties are currently being handled by the
 
board as a whole.
 
The schools' administrative or office personnel staff currently

needs of the school in conjunction with the Officers of the
 
Corporation. Decisions about the misbehavior of a child, the taking
 
class photographs, and the work of a particular contractor are all
 
considered during the weekly meetings of the board. Daily concerns
 
considered during the weekly meeting may effectively crowd  ut those
 
that are less immediate. Time that might be spent in profitable
 
discussion of long-range goals such as the securing of contributions to
 
establish an endowment fund can easily be diverted by hearing about an
 
isolated classroom incident involving one or two children. Because
 
there i
s as yet no individual at the school with the authority to make
 
1
1
 
decisions and carry out policy on daily basis, there is considerable
 
latitude for administrative confusion and breakdowns in communication
 
between and among teachers, staff, parents, children, and community
 
members. Consequently, when the school reopens in September 1982 the
 
board hopes to have secured an administrator who would have such
 
/
 
authority and yet remain responsible and accountable to board members.
 
Irene Junejo has been driving the school's econoline van since the
 
Islamic School of Seattle opened two years ago. She is employed
 
directly by a group of parents to provide transportation for their
 
children along an established route. In addition, Sister Irene drives
 
the van on school field trips1 such as the hayride at the Aqua Barn &
 
School for the preschoolers in May and provides transportation for
 
those in the school's new Women's English Program. The custodial or
 
service personnel staff has three members. Mohamath To las, father of
 
two of the older grade school children, is the school's custodian.

Mohammad Javaharian and Yaghoub Ebrahimi occupy small, remodeled rooms

The employment of these individuals is not insignificant.
 
a recent fundâ€”raising "news update" called attent
 U 
important spinâ€”off of the school has been the job

time of that newsletter Muslim employees included "two preschool
 
teachers, one elementary teacher's aid, one Arabic teacher, one
 
1

secretary, one director of the Women's English Program, one school bus
 
driver, and one custodian." The newsletter also points out that
 
employment at the school offers special benefits to two specific
 
groups. "Muslim women who find it necessary to work are now spared the
 
difficulties of working in a non-Islamic environment" and members of
 
political refugee groups with limited knowledge of English and of

Parents
 
7
 
The scjp

Saturday afternoon meeting a month at the school. Children take home
 
announcements of these
 are encouraged to a
ttend
 
to get to know the other parents and their children's teachers.
 
Meetings of the school's PTA are chaired by a president elected by the
 
parents. Other officers include secretary,  treasurer, publications
 
officer, and bazaar chairperson.
 
The agenda for the January 30,  1982 meeting included:
 
transportation, the new Arabic teacher, the new elementary school
 
teacher,  he new preschool directoress and room, the school's recent
 
accreditation, upcoming PTA elections, and fund raising. During the
 
A
 
1
3
 
year the PTA's Parents Committee held a series of rummage sales,
 
t
o fifteen percent of the parents, a level comparable to that achieved
 
by other PTA groups. With under fifty students in the school and
 
several families sending more than one, even universal participation
 
A
 
would not produce more than a handful o
f active PTA members, however.
 
Moreover, since many of the school's families come from non-Western
 
countries and are often uncomfortable speaking English, the involvement
 
in their children's education and the participatory role expected of
 
them as parents is still unfamiliar. Nonetheless  the Parent Handbook
  
emphasizes parental involvement:  "We believe a child's learning
 
experience is complete when the school and home make a cooperative
 
effort. The school and the home are extensions of one another; our
 
interests are the same, so our actions need be also."
 
Teachers
 
The Islamic School's teaching s
taff changed frequently during the
 
1981-1982 academic year. Between December 1981 and April 1982 five
 
individuals joined the full-time faculty, bringing the total faculty to
 
seven. The teaching staff of the school includes:
 
(
1) Mrs. Ruth Crum, director of the elementary school program and
 
teacher of grades two through six, w e became a member of the school's
 
faculty in December 1
981. She holds a B

certification from the state of Washington at the elementary and high
 
school levels.  She taught for twenty years within the Bellevue

Children
 
When the 1981-1982 school year ended on June 1
1,  1982, forty-seven
 
children between the ages of two-and-a-half and twelve were enrolled in
 
the three classes: preschool, twenty-three; kindergarten-first grade,
 
ten; and second through sixth grade, fourteen. Boys outnumbered girls,
 
but not by much. More than two dozen families were sending their
 
1
6
 
children to the Islamic School of Seattle. These families represented
 
at least six different ethnic or national backgrounds and spoke as many
 
native languages. Some of the families are in the United States only
 
temporarily, planning to return home when a job or degree is finished.
 
For others America has become their new home. Perhaps a quarter of the
 
children were from black or Afro-American families. What do these
 
children and their families have in common? The acceptance of Islam,
 
the pride in calling themselves Muslim, and the desire to learn Arabic,
 
the language of their faith.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
The preschool curriculum includes Arabic, primarily vocabulary
 
building; pre-reading and pre-mathematics (sometimes using Montessori
 
equipment); physical activity (organized games and free play in the
 
gymnasium or outdoors); and religion (memorization of Qur'anic verses
 
and discussion of Islamic manners yI i
cluding stories of the pr
iets).
 
Preschoolers regularly participate in the daily requirements of their
 
faith: the teachers instruct, help, and show them through example "to
 
make wudu" (wash) in preparation for salat (prayer or worship). While
 
the children usually have salat in their own classroom, they often go
 
4
 
to the gymnasium to participate in prayer along with the older
 
children, faculty members and staff, women enrolled in the Women's
 
English Program, and Muslim visitors to the school.
 
/

The curriculum for the elementary school program includes Arabic
 
reading, writing, and conversation; spelling;  religion;  Islamic art and
 
music; and social studies from an Islamic viewpoint. Not all of these
 
subjects are taught every day. During the final quarter the second
 
through sixth graders travelled to the library on Tuesday afternoons,
 
studied Islamic art on Wednesday afternoons, and learned Islamic music
 
on Thursdays. The kindergarten-first grade had a similar schedule:
 
social studies from an Islamic viewpoint Wednesday afternoons. i
 
handwriting on Thursday afternoons.
 
The elementary school children also have regular periods for
 
religious activity.
 .
ch school day opens with the recitation of the
 
Fatiha (
int
duction to pray r). Later in the morning teachers devote
 
time to helping children memorize Qurtanic
 verses through collective
 
and individual recitation. The afternoon instruction includes wudu and
 
salat, often with one of the older boys serving as the imam or leader
 
of the service.
 
The t
ime scheduled for each subject or group of subjects varies.
 
For example,  the daily religion class in the kindergarten-first grade
 
is a half hour, while religion class lasts twenty minutes each day for
 
the second- through. sixth-grade group. Wudu and salat add another forty

minutes to the time set aside in the afternoon for Islamic practices.
 
Generally, the time periods in the elementary school range from thirty
 
to seventy-five minutes. Arabic instruction takes up at least
 
1

thirty-five minutes of each school day, excluding the time spent on the
 
language as part of the daily religion class, salat, Fatiha, and surah
  
recitation (a surah is a chapter, part, or book of the Qu'ran).
 
Moreover, during the 1
981-1982 school year the scheduling of suhj cts

Some of the curriculum materials come from major publishers in the
 
United States. The social studies texts are published by MacMillan as
 
part of their series Places Near and Far. Other texts are donated by
 
Muslim countries through their official government or educational
 
channels. For instance, the Saudi Arabian Educational Mission to the
 
United States contributed Arabic-language textbooks. In addition, the
 
school uses texts developed, published, and distributed by Muslims
 
through their own publishing concerns, bookstores, and organizations.
 
For example, the Islamic Foundation of Leicester, England produces The
 
Muslim Children's Library, a series of small, well produced books to
 
help a Muslim child "develop a fresh faith, a dynamic commitment, a
 
strong identity, and a throbbing yearning and urge to struggle â€”all
 
rooted in Islam." The preschool uses Muslim Nursery Rhymes, Assalamu

The six members oE'the administrative board currently establish
 
and supervise the curriculum, but certified teachers and trained
 
educator-administrators who have accepted Islam may be given more
 
1

authority over curriculum development in the future. Due to the lack of
 
such trained Muslim personnel at the present, time, however,  these tasks
 
have been the responsibility of the board members. In establishing t
he
 
school curriculum they have sought advice from certified teachers and
 
other educators outside the Muslim faith, examined curriculum libraries
 
in this country and abroad, and considered undertaking their own
 
publishing program. The first book, tentatively expected to be
 
available in O
ber 1982, will be a combination workbook and reader
 
for the grade-school children who are not native speakers of Arabic.
 
Board members feel this book and others planned for the series could
 
also be used profitably to teach Arabic to young, native spea)ers of
 
the language,
 â€¢
 -ver.
 
Once this project is successfully under ay, at
 
least one member of the board would like to see the publishing venture
 
expanded to include social studies texts and other materials.
 
In emphasizing the need for such publications, Ann El-Mosliniany
 
remarks, "Maybe thirty percent of the countries the children will be
 
studying are Muslim countries, and they are always presented badly,
 
always. I
've never, ever, ever looked at a textbook that presented a
 
Muslim country in a way that I felt was fair." How could social studies
 
lessons that are unbiased be incorporated into Arabic readers? "We feel
 
that we could use characters, especially, that the children in our
 
school, or other school s---t'ere are other Islamic schools in the
 
U.
uld identify with," responds Sister Ann. "Children who have,
 
maybe, Pakistani origin, who go back to visit Pakistan. And this is a
 
good place to show what these children would see in Pakistan, what ways

they would see that are different from what they do in the U.S. And we

children as the characters in the book." In addition to providi

incorporating illust ations and other stimulating and interesting

The school provides the textbooks and the children purchase their
 
own workbooks. Earlier in the year  If tah,Ya Sem Sem ( en sesame), an
 
Arabic version of the popular children's program Sesame Street,
 
assisted teachers-t
-&-present Arabic instruction. Produced in Kuwait,
 
the program made Arabic more accessible
 the preschoolers, while
 
making the Arabic-speaking children feel a bit more at home, since the
 
program contained familiar sights, sounds, and people. When Mrs. Crum
 
joined the teaching staff as director of the elementary school and
 
teacher of kindergarten through sixth grade (later, second 4hrough
 
sixth grades), she initiated the weekly walks to the public branch
 
library just a few blocks from the school. A bookmobile regularly
 
visits the school so that U
tnmil Khair Ishfaaq, director of the
 
preschool, can select appropriate books for her childre
 
All of the teachers rely on handouts to reinforce their lessons.
 
For example, Brother husein prepares sheets with pictures of familiar
 
animals and objects, followed by the Arabic name, leaving a space for
 
the children to practice writing the correct identification. Sister
 
2
1
 
Mary found that the children in the kindergarten-fi t grade group
 
remembered and understood the topic of a religion cl
s better when she
 
included a supporting exercise 
,,such as a worksheet to complete or an
 
assignment to "draw and color  hat we have been talking about." Later,
 
several of these sheets were assembled in a religious booklet made by
 
the children as part of 
religion class project. Mrs. Crum and Mrs.
 
Thorne rely on similar handouts, as well as on colored construction
 
paper, recycled computer printouts, and other assorted materials to
 
encourage the children and stimulate their imagination. Due to limited
 
resources, the teachers and the children have had to be creative. In
 
the preschool Sister U
inmil has introduced the children to
 
"manipulatives" associated with the Montessori method of instruction.
 
She has also encouraged the children to explore the objects in the
 
classroom and has played "word bingo'  t
o increase their vocabulary
 
skills.
 
The children are tested and graded on a regular basis. The school
 
year is divided into four quarters and report cards are distributed to
 
the parents at a scheduled parent-teacher conference held at the end of
 
each quarter. Each "card" is actually an 8 1/2 x 14-inch, five-page,
 
pressure-sensitive form. This format permits a quarterly report
 
permanent record of the academic (reading, language arts, spelli
 
handwriting, mathematics, social studies, science, Arabic language,
 
religion, art, and music) and personal (

each academic subject to indicate how they compare the child's effort
 
to his or her own ability. The card also shows the "achievement grade,"
 
which compares the child's achievement with other students at the same
 
grade level. The "key" or ranking procedure i
s the same for both effort
 
and achievement:  "good," "satisfactory," and  needs improvement." At
 
the bottom of the grade form is a space for teachers'  comments and a
 
place t

with the child fills in the appropriate i

Purposes of the School
 
)
 
The founders and the administrators of the Islamic School of
 
Seattle have sought to provide an Islamic environment for their
 
community's school-age children, not a school for Muslim children where
 
all of their subjects, except religion, are divorced from their Islamic
 
faith. As Sister Ann explains,  "It's not that
 
that the non-Islamic world doesn't
 
our kids that Islam is everywhere.
 
aspect of what they are studying."
 
exist, but
 
And t
o let
 
It i
s this
 
we are trying to pretend
 
we'd also like to show
 
it [
Islam] pervade every
 
emphasis on an Islamic
 
23
 
atmosphere, more than the teaching of unusual or religious subjects,
 
that distinguishes the Islamic School of Seattle. Islamic religion and
 
Arabic classes are part of the curriculum at every level. Formal
 
classes in Qur'an, Islamic studies, and classical Arabic are required
 
of all students in the elementary school program. During school hours
 
all children participate in salat,  taking their places among peers and
 
teachers.
 
Those seeking admission for their children are reminded by the
 
Parent Handbook that at the Islamic School of Seattle "education is
 
provided within an Islamic framework, and parents should bear in mind
 
that Islam is not only a part of the curriculum, but it is the essence
 
of the school's being." It is this commitment to Islam as a total way
 
of life that provides the framework for the development of the school's
 
specialized education program designed to meet all the children's
 
needs--physical, emotional, educational, and spiritual.
 
There are differences of opinion about the importance of specific
 
subject matter and the amount of time spent on different subjects,
 
however. For example, there has been discussion about extending the
 
school day for the older children beginning in 1
982-1983. Instruction
 
during the day could then be divided equally between the study of
 
Arabic and the study of English subjects. The school board members
 
anticipate resistance to such a change from the two non-Muslim
 
teachers. "To them, of course, this isn't so important. I
 
mean, they can't see the importance; but it is important, and it's our
 
2
4
 
school," explains Sister Ann. For their part, the non-Muslim t
eachers
 
fully support the religious premise of the school, finding i
t
 
compatible with their own deeply held Christian beliefs. The non-Muslim
 
teachers are, nonetheless,  concerned about the amount of time allotted
 
to "the basic
e core courses required by the Washington State
 
Department of Education-
--f-or which, as certified teachers, they are
 
directly responsible.
 /
 
Yet, even in teaching these basic subjects, both teachers
 
consciously '
attempt to include religious principles and the presence of
 
Allah in their lessons and in their interaction with the children.
 
During a morning science class, for instance, Mrs. Crum helped her
 
second_through_sixth -
grade class understand the earth's rotation on its
 
â€¢
_\
 '\
 
axis, the planet's movement around the sun, and the relationship of
 
these activities to day, night, and seasonal changes. Using a globe and
 
flashlight she and the children portrayed the seasonal
 
about their effects on the children's lives. "When the
 
I can play outside more," realized Mubarak. "The ti
 
changes, talking
 
days are longer,
 
for salat
 
changes," recalled Rohymah. Then, bringing an interesting and
 
informative science lesson to a close, Mrs. Crum reminded the children
 
that such things are not an accicent but "part of Allah's plan."
 
Still, the ranking order of the important subjects and the
 
allocation of time to different classes remain potentially serious
 
areas for misunderstanding, even conflict. To be ( we n-educateci Muslim
 
one has to know Arabic. Although the "total immersion" Arabic-language
 
25
 
an for the preschool i
s as yet unrealized, and the "truly b
ilingual,
 
Arabic-English" elementary school program has not been established,  the
 
board remains cornmmitted t
o those programs to generate Arabic fluency
 
among the Muslim children. During the final quarter of the 1981-1982
 
school year board members supported some changes in the teaching day to
 
accomodate more Islam in the subject areas, particularly in those
 
associated with the humanities and social sciences. Samia El-Moslimany
 
began coming to the school in the afternoons to lead the classes in art
 
and music, emphasizing Islamic influences, characteristJ cs  and
 
appreciation.  In one art project the elementary school children
 
paracticed calligraphy, writing the name "Allah" and then braiding
 
colored streamers to paste onto the decorative handwriting. Mary Abdi,
 
an assistant in the elementary program, assumed full responsibility for
 
the social studies portion of the curriculum during the same quarter.
 
On Fridays Sister Mary would of tcn present social studies from an

The children aged seven to twelve in Mrs. Crum's class know why
 
they go t
o the Islamic School of Seattle: their parents send them. They
 
are also quite certain why their parents want them to go:  "Here I am
 
with other Muslims." "At this school I am able to pray." "I can learn
 
Arabic. I can learn to be a good Muslim." "The teachers here are good.
 
They are Muslims, like me." The response to my question,  "What classes
 
do you like the most?" was immediate and unanimous--"Arabic!" In our
 
conversations several children suggested other favorites, for example,
 
26
 
recess. This response prompted delighted giggles from other classmates
 
who were vainly
 
to be serious while be
 recorded by their
 
now familiar visitor. This distraction aside, the children focused upon
 
those subjects unique t
o their school: studying Arabic, memorizing
 
Qur'anic verses, and working on Islamic art projects. Eager to show me
 
how much Arabic they had learned and t
o hear their voices on the tape,
 
many of the children volunteered estimates of the size of his or her
 
Arabic vocabulary.
 
As to why they like studying Arabic, Lawrence, an eight -year-old
 
boy quite new to the school responded: "I like Arabic because Allah
 
made this kind of language." Do they practice Arabic at home? "Yes,
 
it's the language of our religion," several stressed.
 
All but two of the children now enrolled in the elementary school
 
program had attended one or more schools before coming to the Islamic
 
School of Seattle. Consequently, many of them could offer comparisons
 
of their experience in those schools with that of being a student at
 
the Islamic School. "At this school we learn English," said Ibrahim, a
 
boy who previously attended a school in Saudi Arabia. Mubarak, an
 
Afro-American, emphasized that at the Islamic School he knew that he
 
would receive "right lessons." Rohynak, a Cham refugee from Southeast
 
Asia and the oldest girl in the class, observed quietly: "We come to
 
learn to be good Muslims."

For most of the children school hours provide virtually the only
 
t
ime t
o see one another. With the exception of the Chains, who have
 
largely been settled together in city-owned apartment buildings in
 
Seattle, and some of the families residing in university or college
 
housing units, most of the children and their families are scattered
 
throughout Seattle. One family lives in suburban Kent, necessitating a
 
trip of sixty miles each day by car so the children can attend school.
 
Several of the children participate in "Sunday school" at the mosque,
 
learning Arabic and religion in classes with some of their classmates.
 
There they are joined by other Muslim children who are not students at
 
the Islamic school of Seattle. Although there is no official
 
relationship between the mosque school and the Islamic
hool, many of
 
the same people are
 
involved in both. For instance, Sister Samia
 
teaches Arabic to the children in the mosque school on Sundays, and
 
Sister Ann proudly reports, "Our children are the star pupils!"
 
In the final analysis how do the children feel about attending the
 
Islamic School of Seattle? Certainly, they are glad to be there. During
 
one discussion Jamilla and her younger brother Ibrahim
 
b
o
*i
r spoke
 
excitedly about the school, saying, "a few more weeks and we'll be off
 
probation." Referring to the of
 f cial 1 trjal period of six weeks for all
 
new students
iey were literally counting the days un
'ETI
T
he school
 
would be truly theirs. "Just sixteen more days and we'll be real
 
students!" Jainilla enthusiastically reminded her brother. Asking the
 
children to help me understand what attending the Islamic School of
 
28
 
Seattle means to them, I suggested that they attempt to think how each
 
of them might describe their school to a new child, a child of their
 
own age, coming to the school for the first t
ime.
 
Jamilla:
 "Coming to the Islamic School would be like
 
coraing to a new world."
 
Ibrahim:
 "
I would teach him to pray."
 
Mubarak:
 "I would teach him the Arabic alphabet."
 
Jamilla:
 "We have different subjects."
 
Mubarak:
 "We're Muslims and they're not, but we can
 
still teach them to be good Muslims."
 
Rohymah:
 "I would show the girls how to cover their
 
heads, so they would b
e comfortable."
 
History of the Islamic School of Seattle
 
From three families and a handful of unmarried students in the
 
early 1
960s,  the Muslim community of Seattle has grown to between 7
,000
 
and 9
,000 persons in the 1980s. The community experienced its greatest
 
growth, accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of i
ts
 
school-age children, in the past decade. On February 3
,  1980 a small
 
group of Muslim women from the Seattle area met officially for the
 
first time to found a school. Upon incorporation of the Islamic School
 
of Seattle on February 24,  1980, these Muslim parents and educators
 
became the Board of Directors.
 
The Parent Handbook, a twelve-page booklet written by the Muslim
 
administrators and distributed to the school's families, articulates
 
the aims of the Islamic education provided by the school. The school's
 
goals are:
 
1
. To provide our children with an atmosphere, as close
 
to the Islamic ideal as possible, in which they can
 
grow and learn as whole individuals, intellectually,
 
spiritually, and physically.
 
2
. To strengthen them to meet and to effectively deal
 
with the challenges of living in the modern American
 
society.
 
3
. To instill in them a pride in their heritage by
 
enabling them to approach knowledge from a Muslim point
 
of view and by presenting a balanced education with as
 
much emphasis on the Muslim world as on the West.
 
4
. To offer t

The p
ilot project, a modified Montessori preschool and
 
kindergarten, opened on September 2
, 1
980. During its first year the
 
I
slamic School of Seattle shared facilities with the Islamic Center of
 
Seattle, both occupying a house owned by the I
slamic Center i
n the
 
c
ity's south end a

age range and told them about the new school, urging them t

children, and the other founders the approach was straightforward:  '
We
 
knew all the families in that category." Those contacted r

the upper grades. During the spring of 1
981 the school's founders gave
 
serious consideration to the pros and cons of building a school at a
 
new site or buying an older building. They f
inally located a solidly
 
built, two-story schoolhouse in Seattle's central section. The
 
architecturally impressive structure at 720 2
5th Avenue, built in 1
930,
 
was first occupied by the Hebrew Academy. In the 1960s the city leased
 
it as a public education and youth services facility. During t
he
 
1
970s, however, it stood empty, a target for vandals. The building was
 
in sad disrepair when Seattle Muslims purchased i
t for $350,000.
 
"
I was in Kuwait when they called me about finding the building,"
 
recalls Sister Ann.
 
It was a lot of money, all in cash, and due in three
 
weeks. I was asked if I thought I could raise the
 
money. I didn't know, but upon talking with a family
 
friend who knew more about these things than I did, i
t
 
was agreed that I should try. I telephoned back the
 
decision. The deposit of $50,000 was made and we
 
raised what we needed, although it was closer to six
 
weeks by the time all the money was raised and the
 
paperwork done.
 
Before opening for the 1981-1982 academic year, the school's
 
founders repaired the lovely red tile roof of their new building,
 
painted and put new flooring in two classrooms on the first floor, and
 
made all the changes necessary to comply with city and state health and
 
safety codes. Although professional contractors, some of whom were
 
themselves members of the Muslim community, completed the major
 
structural work, volunteers recruited from among parents, students, and
 
4
 
the Muslim community as a whole pitched in on some of the other tasks.
 
During the 1981-1982 school year yet another group of volunteers
 
renovated a third, larger room for the preschoolers. Repairs and
 
renovations have continued as funds and resources have become
 
available. In addition, community members have regularly donated their
 
skills and materials.  For example, artist Jamshid Kavoussi handpainted
 
verses from the Qur'an in graceful Arabic script at child's-eye level
 
along the building's main hallway and the name "
Islamic School of
 
Seattle" in English and Arabic above the large entrance way.
 
In December 1
981 the Washington State Board of Education granted
 
full s
tate approval to the preschool and elementary programs offered by
 
the Islamic School of Seattle, finding that the school met all fire,
 
health, and safety codes and provided qualified teachers for i
ts
 
classes. At the close of the 1981-1982 school year nearly fifty
 
children between the ages of two-and-a-half and twelve were enrolled in
 
the school's three sections:  the preschool, the kindergarten-first
 
grade class, and the second-through-sixth-grade class. The latter two
 
classes constitute the school's elementary program.
 
Members of the Muslim community throughout the United States and
 
abroad, especially in Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, assisted the
 
Seattle Muslim community with the purchase of the school and have
 
supported its continuing renovation and operation. The Arabic word
 
zakat, which literally means  "
purification," has no precise English
 
equivalent. It i
s a Muslim's worship of God by means of his wealth
 
5
 
through an obligatory form of giving to those in need. Zakat funds may
 
also be spent in the cause of God for the construction of mosques,
 
religious schools, or hospitals and for the salaries of those involved
 
in the propagation or study of Islam whose work keeps them from having
 
t
ime t
o earn a livelihood.
 
Besides the payment of the obligatory zakat, Islam also urges
 
Muslims to give voluntary charity, to the extent they can afford,  to
 
those in need. Indeed, charitableness is among the most stressed
 
qualities in Islam. Since Muslims are supposed to be always
 
responsive to human need and distress, Muslims regard their wealth as a
 
trust from God which is to be used not only for themselves and their
 
families, but for other human beings in need a
s well. The proper Muslim
 
attitude is set out in the Qur'an:
 
Never will you attain to the highest degree of virtue unless
 
you spend in the cause of Allah out of that which you
 
love; and whatever you spend, Allah surely knows i
t
 
well.
 (3:93)
 
They also ask thee what shall
 
Whatever is spare. (2:22
 
they c

Consequently, donations that hav
 
of Seattle must be understood not as the largess of wealthy individuals
 
but as an act of worship required of all Muslims in the practice of
 
their faith. For example, Jodi Shahabi, a volunteer at the school, and
 
her husband are students at the University of Washington. They have a

small daughter who will attend the preschool in September 1
982. Like
 
most student couples raising a family and going to school, they
 
experience financial constraints. Nonetheless, Sister Jodi assumes her
 
responsibility as a Muslim and designates her zakat to the Islamic
 
School.
 
I
slam is a complete code of life; Muslims must seek knowledge of
 
the basic tenets of Islam and relate them to all aspects of their
 
individual and social life. In addition, Muslim parents are r
esponsible
 
for the spiritual instruction of their children. The Islamic community
 
has an obligation, therefore, to educate i
ts children in the path of
 
Islam. When the Seattle Muslim community i
s unable to fulfill this
 
responsibility alone, it is Islamically correct for Seattle Muslims to
 
approach the worldwide Muslim community for assistance. Such an appeal
 
for assistance may not have only monetary aims. Husein Saleh, the
 
Arabic teacher in the grade school program, is teaching in response to
 
a sense of obligation.  "
I am not trained in teaching Arabic," he says.
 
"My wife is a linguist and she has helped me prepare many of the
 
materials. My training and interest i
s in many fields. For example, I
 
have my master's in urban planning. But, it i
s my obligation to teach
 
Arabic. Each day I ask if they have found another teacher. How can I
 
not teach the students Arabic? It i
s our language of our religion. It
 
is my duty."
 
To meet i
ts f
inancial obligations t
he I
slamic School o
f S
eattle
 
has relied heavily on donations from Muslim individuals and
 
organizations. The school has encouraged individuals and groups t
o plan
 
fund-raising activities. It also charges its s
tudents tuition. In
 
addition, the school has initiated educational projects t
hat will
 
provide income and has begun planning for an endowment fund t
o ensure
 
i
ts f
inancial well-being and continuation.
 
In addition t
o monetary donations, offers o
f supplies and
 
volunteer labor f
rom Muslim parents, s
tudents, and community members
 
have frequently helped stretch funds even further. A community-wide
 
effort was put forth to shape up the new school building f

imilar effort readied the new
 
preschool  room for i
ts February opening. In addition, members o
f the
 
c o m m unity have aided the school over and over again by donating needed
 
i
tems.  "
Twice our needs have been met even before we asked," notes
 
school secretary Diana Akhgar.  "
On the very day that we had t
o place an
 
order for additional tables and chairs for the c

In addition, to r
emain responsive to the community,  the school has
 
selected an administrative board, the Officers of the Corporation, from
 
interested community members. This administrative board meets weekly to
 
establish future policies, set priorities, and consider day-to-day
 
problems. It is in charge of all personnel, curriculum, and budget
 
matters, as well as building plans. Board members consult with the
 
school's teaching staff on a monthly basis and with other individuals
 
a
s needed. Currently, six individuals are serving on the school's
 
administrative board: Abdul-Raouf Mannaa (
president), Faizullah Kakar
 
(vice-president), Suzette Kakar (secretary), Ann El-Moslimany
 
(
fund-raising chairman abroad), Abdullah Abduijabbar, and Mohammad
 
El-Moslimany. The position of treasurer, formerly occupied by Abdalla
 
Shamia, is vacant;  those duties are currently being handled by the
 
board as a whole.

needs of the school in conjunction with the Officers of the
 
Corporation. Decisions about the misbehavior of a child, the taking of
 
class photographs, and the work of a particular contractor are all
 
considered during the weekly meetings of the board. Daily concerns
 
considered during the weekly meeting may effectively crowd out those
 
that are less immediate. Time that might be spent in profitable
 
discussion of long-range goals, such as the securing of contributions
 
to establish an endowment fund, can easily be diverted by hearing about
 
1
1
 
an i
solated classroom incident involving one or two children. Because
 
there is as yet no individual at the school with the authority t
o make
 
decisions and carry out policy on daily basis, there is considerable
 
latitude for administrative confusion and breakdowns in communication
 
between and among teachers, staff, parents, children, and community
 
members. Consequently, when the school reopens in September 1982 the
 
board hopes to have secured an administrator who would have such
 
authority and yet remain responsible and accountable to board members.
 
Irene Junejo has been driving the school's econoline van s
ince the
 
Islamic School of Seattle opened two years ago. She is employed
 
directly by a group of parents to provide transportation for their
 
children along an established route. In addition, Sister Irene drives
 
the van on school field trips, such as the hayride at the Aqua Barn
 
School for the preschoolers in May, and provides transportation f
 
those in the school's new Women's English Program. The custodial or
 
service personnel staff has three members. Mohamath Toulas, father of
 
two of the older grade school children, is the school's custodian.
 
Mohammad Javaharlan and Yaghoub Ebrahimi occupy small, remodeled rooms
 
in the school's basement in exchange for carrying out the
 
responsibilities of security personnel.
 
The employment of these individuals is not insignificant. Indeed,
 
a recent fundâ€”raising  news update" called attention to it:  "An
 
important spinâ€”off of the school has been the jobs which we have been
 
able t
o provide to Muslims from within the Seattle community." At the
 
1
2
 
t
ime of that newsletter Muslim employees included "
two preschool
 
teachers, one elementary teacher's aid, one Arabic teacher, one
 
secretary, one director of the Women's English Program, one school bus
 
driver, and one custodian." The newsletter also points out that
 
employment at the school offers special benefits to two specific
 
groups.  "Muslim women who find it necessary to work are now spared the
 
difficulties of working in a non-Islamic environment," and members of
 
political refugee groups with limited knowledge of English and of
 
American society and culture, who need to support their families, can
 
work within a more "
supportive and familiar environment."
 
Parents
 
The Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) schedules one Saturday
 
afternoon meeting a month at the school. Children take home
 
announcements of these meetings and their parents are encouraged to
 
attend to get to know the other parents and their children's teachers.
 
Meetings of the school's PTA are chaired by a president elected by the
 
parents. Other officers include secretary, treasurer, publications
 
officer, and bazaar chairperson.
 
The agenda for the January 30,  1982 meeting included:
 
transportation, the new Arabic teacher, the new elementary school
 
teacher, the new preschool directoress and room) the school's recent
 
accreditation, upcoming PTA elections, and fund-raising. During the
 
1
3
 
school year the PTA's Parents Committee held a series of rummage sales,
 
raising more than $
1,000 toward the purchase of playground equipment.
 
Participation in the PTA has been estimated at approximately ten
 
to fifteen percent of the parents, a level comparable to that achieved
 
by other PTA groups. With under fifty students in the school and
 
several families sending more than one child, even universal
 
participation would not produce more than a handful of active PTA
 
members, however. Moreover, since many of the school's families come
 
from non-Western countries and are often uncomfortable speaking
 
English, the involvement in their children's education and the
 
participatory role expected of them as parents is still unfamiliar.
 
Nonetheless, the Parent Handbook emphasizes parental involvement:  "We
 
believe a child's learning experience is complete when the school and
 
home make a cooperative effort. The school and the home are extensions
 
of one another; our interests are the same, so our actions need be
 
also."
 
The Islamic School's teaching staff changec
 
1981-1982 academic year. Between December 1981 and April 1982 five
 
individuals joined the full-time faculty, bringing the total faculty to
 
seven. The teaching staff of the school includes:
 
1
4
 
(
1) Mrs. Ruth Crum, director of the elementary school program and
 
teacher of grades two through six, became a member of the school's
 
faculty in December 1
981. She holds a B
.A. from Seattle University and
 
certification from the state of Washington at the elementary and high
 
school levels. She taught for twenty years within the Bellevue
 
[
Washington]  School District. Most recently Mrs. Crum spent a year in
 
Peru and three years in Yemen, t
eaching primarily English-as-a-second_
 
Language (ESL) in local schools.
 
(
2) Mrs. Carol Thorne, kindergarten-first grade teacher, was
 
hired in April 1982. She earned her B.A. from the University of
 
Washington, Seattle, specializing in elementary education. Before
 
coming to the Islamic School Mrs. Thorne taught for several years in a
 
suburban Roman Catholic school and was a substitute teacher for the
 
city of Seattle.
 
(
3) Ummil Khair Ishfaaq joined the staff a
s director and t
eacher
 
of the preschool in December 1981. Sister Ummil earned her A.A. in
 
early childhood education from Seattle Central Community College.
 
Before joining the faculty she operated a successful Montessori
 
preschool program in her home. It was the first Muslim preschool in
 
Seattle â€”predating the efforts of the Islamic School of Seattle--and
 
many children attended the school specifically for the Islamic
 
a
tmosphere that Sister Ummil created.
 She is currently  taking
 
additional Montessori classes during the summer at a local community
 
college with the financial assistance of the Officers of the
 
Corporation.
 
(4) Husein Saleh, Arabic teacher for the elementary school
 
program, has been at the school since January 1982. Untrained in
 
foreign language teaching, he draws upon his own experiences in
 
learning English as a second language and his wife's expertise as a
 
linguist in preparing his lessons. Brother Husein, who is a native
 
speaker of Arabic, came to the United States from Jordan four years ago
 
to study for an M.A. in urban planning at the University of Oklahoma.
 
(5) Muhammad Nasser Jappee, preschool Arabic teacher, joined the
 
faculty in May 1982. A native of South Africa, he learned Arabic as a
 
student in Saudi Arabia. Before coming to Seattle he taught Arabic to
 
English-speaking students in Johannesburg, South Africa. In addition to
 
Arabic language instruction, Brother Muhammad has taught calligraphy on
 
occasion to the school's second through sixth grade students, and he
 
has also assisted Samia El-Moslimany in teaching them Arabic songs for
 
the Islamic Center Camp benefit.
 
(
6) Azhar Ibrahim, teacher's aid in the preschool, is the only
 
member of the present faculty to have started in September 1981, when
 
the Islamic School of Seattle opened for its second year. Sister Azhar,
 
who has an M.A. in Persian studies, is frequently called upon to share
 
her knowledge of religion, the Qur'an, and Islamic history and culture.
 
1
5
 
(
7) Mary Abdi, who is a teacher's aid in the kindergarten and
 
elementary school classes, became a member of the teaching staff in
 
November 1
981. She i
s an undergraduate student in anthropology at the
 
University of Washington, Seattle and has a special interest in
 
elementary education. Sister Mary works with Mrs. Crum and Mrs. Thorne,
 
assisting with reading groups, homework assignments, and review
 
exercises while the teachers work with the other students. More
 
recently, Sister Mary has been conducting social studies and religion
 
classes.
 
The faculty i
s paid on a monthly basis, according to the following
 
schedule:  director of the elementary school, $
1,111; director of the
 
preschool, $700; kindergarten-first grade teacher, $700;  and
 
teaching assistants and Arabic teachers, $4.75 per hour.
 
Volunteers from Seattle's Muslim community augment the t
eaching
 
staff. For example, Samia El-Moslimany, a college student and daughter
 
of Sister Ann, has been teaching Islamic art and music classes in the
 
elementary school program, and Sister Jodi has recently begun assisting
 
with reading and special reviews in the kindergarten-first grade Ci
 
Also, before her marriage and subsequent move to Indiana last fall,
 
Zainab Ubaidullah, a member of the Board of Directors and i
ts
 
"
Perpetual President," taught religion to the kindergarten and
 
elementary school s
tudents.
 
Children
 
When the 1
981-1982 school year ended on June 1
1,  1
982, forty-seven
 
children between the ages of two-and-a-half and twelve were enrolled in
 
the three classes: preschool, twenty-three; kindergarten-first grade,
 
1
6
 
ten; and second through sixth grade, fourteen. Boys outnumbered girls,
 
but not by much. More than two dozen families were sending their
 
children to the Islamic School of Seattle. These families represented
 
at least six different ethnic or national backgrounds and spoke as many
 
native languages. Some of the families are in the United States only
 
temporarily, planning to return home when a job or degree i
s finished.
 
For others, America has become their new home. Perhaps a quarter of the
 
children were from black or Afro-American families. What do these
 
children and their families have in common? The acceptance of Islam,
 
the pride in calling themselves Muslim, and the desire to learn Arabic,
 
the language of their faith.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
The preschool curriculum includes Arabic, primarily vocabulary
 
building; pre-reading and pre-mathematics (sometimes using Montessori
 
equipment); physical activity (organized games and free play in the
 
gymnasium or outdoors); and religion (memorization of Qur'anic verses
 
and discussion of Islamic manners or stories of the prophets).
 
Preschoolers regularly participate in the daily requirements of their
 
faith: the teachers instruct, help, and show them through example  t0
 
make wudu" (wash) in preparation for salat (prayer or worship). While
 
the children usually have salat in their own classroom, they often also
 
go  Lu  Loe  gymuas LUti
l  Lo  parLicipaLe  in prayer  along wiLn  t
u e  01,:
 
children, faculty members and staff, women enrolled in the Women's
 
English Program, and Muslim visitors to the school.
 
The curriculum for the elementary school program includes Arabic
 
reading, writing, and conversation; spelling; religion;  Islamic art and
 
music;  and social studies from an Islamic viewpoint. Not all of these
 
subjects are taught every day. During the final quarter the second
 
through sixth graders travelled to the library on Tuesday afternoons,
 
studied Islamic art on Wednesday afternoons, and learned Islamic music
 
on Thursdays. The kindergarten-first grade had a similar schedule:
 
social studies from an Islamic viewpoint Wednesday afternoons,
 
handwriting on Thursday afternoons.
 
The elementary school children also have regular periods for
 
religious activity. Each school day opens with the recitation of the
 
Fatiha (
seven verses that must be recited at the beginning of a prayer
 
ritual). Later in the morning teachers devote time to helping children
 
memorize Qur'anic verses through collective and individual recitation.
 
The afternoon instruction includes wudu and salat, often with one of
 
the older boys serving as the imam or leader of the service.
 
The time scheduled for each subject or group of subjects varies.
 
For example, the daily religion class in the kindergarten-first grade
 
i
s a half hour, while religion class lasts twenty minutes each day for
 
the second-through-sixth-grade group. Wudu and salat add another forty
 
1
8
 
minutes to the t
ime set aside in the afternoon for Islamic practices.
 
Generally,  the time periods in the elementary school range from thirty
 
to seventy-five minutes. Arabic instruction takes up at least
 
thirty-five minutes of each school day, excluding the time spent on the
 
language as part of the daily religion class, salat, Fatiha, and surah
  
recitation (a surah i
s a chapter, part, or book of the Qu'ran).
 
Moreover, during the 1
981-1982 school year the scheduling of subjects
 
changed to reflect alterations in teaching staff and volunteers,
 
availability of audio-visual materials and equipment, and concerns
 
raised by Muslim parents or board members.
 
Some of the curriculum materials come from major publishers in the
 
United States. The social studies texts ar ,
 
part of their series Places Near and Far.
 
Muslim countries through their official government or educational
 
channels. For instance, the Saudi Arabian Educational Mission to the
 
United States contributed Arabic-language textbooks. In addition, the
 
school uses texts developed, published, and distributed by Muslims
 
through their own publishing concerns, bookstores, and organizations.
 
For example, the Islamic Foundation of Leicester, England produces The
 
Muslim Children's Library, a series of small, well-produced books to
 
help a Muslim child "
develop a fresh faith, a dynamic commitment, a
 
strong identity, and a throbbing yearning and urge to struggle â€”all
 
rooted in Islam." The preschool uses Muslim Nursery Rhymes, Assalamu
  
alaikum (Peace be with you), and several other books from the series.
 
1

The six members of the administrative board currently establish
 
and supervise the curriculum, but certified teachers and trained
 
educator-administrators who have accepted Islam may be given more
 
authority over curriculum development in the future. Due to the lack of
 
such trained Muslim personnel at the present time, however, these tasks
 
have been the responsibility of the board members. In establishing the
 
school curriculum they have sought advice from certified teachers and
 
other educators outside the Muslim faith, examined curriculum libraries
 
in this country and abroad, and considered undertaking their own
 
publishing program. The first book, tentatively expected to be
 
available in October 1
982, will be a combination workbook and reader
 
for the grade school children who are not native speakers of Arabic.
 
Board members feel this book and others planned for the series could
 
also be used profitably to teach Arabic to young, native speakers of
 
the language. Once this project is successfully under way, at least one
 
member of the board would like to see the publishing venture expanded
 
to include social studies texts and other materials.
 
In emphasizing the need for such publications, Ann El-Moslimany
 
remarks,  "Maybe thirty percent of the countries the children will be
 
studying are Muslim countries, and they are always presented badly,
 
always. I
've never, ever, ever looked at a textbook that presented a
 
Muslim country in a way that I felt was fair." How could social studies
 
lessons that are unbiased be incorporated into Arabic readers?  "We feel
 
that we could use characters, especially, that the children in our
 
school, or other schools--there are other Islamic schools in the
 
20
 
U
.S.--would identify with," responds Sister Ann.  "
Children who have,
 
maybe, Pakistani origin, who go back to visit Pakistan. And this is a
 
good place to show what these children would see in Pakistan, what ways
 
they would see that are different from what they do in the U.S. And we
 
could do it with various nationalities; just have a few of these
 
children as the characters in the book.
"  In addition to providing
 
Western-style books, incorporating illustrations and other stimulating
 
and interesting presentation techniques, for their own and other
 
Islamic schools, the venture should i
l sn r
Ptur  pr f f
ts drpc 1 v t
 
The school provides the textbooks and the children purchase their
 
own workbooks. Earlier in the year If tah ya sem sem (Open sesame), an
 
Arabic version of the popular children's program Sesame Street,
 
assisted teachers in presenting Arabic instruction. Produced in
 
Kuwait, the program made Arabic more accessible to the preschoolers,
 
while making the Arabic-speaking children feel a bit more at home,
 
since the program contained familiar sights, sounds, and people. When
 
Mrs. Crum joined the teaching staff as director of the elementary
 
school and teacher of kindergarten through sixth grade (later, second
 
through sixth grades), she initiated the weekly walks to the public
 
branch library just a few blocks from the school. A bookmobile
 
regularly visits the school so that Ummil Khair Ishfaaq, director of
 
the preschool, can select appropriate books for her children.
 
2
1
 
All of the teachers rely on handouts to reinforce their l
essons.
 
For example, Brother Husein prepares sheets with pictures of familiar
 
animals and objects, followed by the Arabic name, leaving a space for
 
the children to practice writing the correct identification. Sister
 
Mary found that the children in the kindergarten-first grade group
 
remembered and understood the topic of a religion lesson better when
 
she included a supporting exercise, such as a worksheet to complete or
 
an assignment to "
draw and color what we have been talking about."
 
Later,
 several of these sheets were assembled in a religious booklet
 
made by the children as part of one religion class project. Mrs. Crum
 
and Mrs. Thorne rely on similar handouts, as well as on colored
 
construction paper, recycled computer printouts, and other assorted
 
materials to encourage the children and stimulate their imagination.
 
Due to limited resources, the teachers and the children have had to be
 
creative. In the preschool Sister l
Jmmil has introduced the children to
 
"manipulatives" associated with the Montessori method of instruction.
 
She has also encouraged the children to explore the objects in the
 
classroom and has played "word bingo" to increase their vocabulary
 
skills.
 
The children are tested and graded on a regular basis. The school
 
year is divided into four quarters and report cards are distributed to
 
the parents at a scheduled parent-teacher conference held at the end of
 
each quarter. Each "card" is actually an 8 1/2 x 14-inch, five-page,
 
pressure-sensitive form. This format permits a quarterly report and
 
permanent record of the academic (reading, language arts, spelling,
 
22
 
handwriting, mathematics, social studies, science, Arabic language,
 
religion, art, and music) and personal ("listens  attentively,"
 
"
follows directions," "
shows respect for authority," and "works
 
independently") development of each child. An evaluation of the effort
 
expended by the child is also possible, since teachers have space under
 
each academic subject to indicate how they compare the child's effort
 
to his or her own ability. The card also shows the "achievement grade,"
 
which compares the child's achievement with other students at the same
 
grade level. The "
key" or ranking procedure is the same for both effort
 
and achievement:  "good," "satisfactory," and "needs improvement." At
 
the bottom of the grade form is a space for teachers'  comments and a
 
place to indicate promotion or grade assignment. Each teacher who works
 
with the child fills in the appropriate items, giving an evaluation of
 
the child's work during the quarter. Parents and teachers are
 
encouraged to request a conference at any time during the year.
 
Interpreters are often present during such conferences, whenever a
 
language problem might arise.
 
Purposes of the School
 
The founders and the administrators of the Islamic School of
 
Seattle have sought to provide an Islamic environment for their
 
community's school-age children, not a school fQr Muslim children where
 
all of their subjects, except religion, are divorced from their Islamic
 
faith. As Sister Ann explains,  "It's not that we are trying to pretend
 
that the nonâ€”Islamic world doesn't exist, but we'd also like to show
 
our kids that Islam is everywhere. And to let it  [Islam] pervade every
 
aspect of what they are studying." It is this emphasis on an Islamic
 
atmosphere, more than the teaching of unusual or religious subjects,
 
that distinguishes the Islamic School of Seattle.  Islamic religion and
 
Arabic classes are part of the curriculum at every level. Formal
 
classes in the Qur'an,  Islamic studies,  and classical Arabic are
 
required of all students in the elementary school program. During
 
school hours all children participate in salat,  taking their places
 
among peers and teachers.
 
Those seeking admission for their children are r
eminded by the
 
Parent Handbook that a
t the Islamic School of Seattle "
education i
s
 
provided within an Islamic framework, and parents should bear in mind
 
that I

specialized education program designed to meet all the children's
 
needs--physical, emotional, educational, and s

NM
 
Arabic and the s
tudy of English subjects. The school board members
 
anticipate resistance t
o such a change from the two non-Muslim
 
t
eachers.  "
To them, of course, this i
sn't so important. I
 
mean, they can't see the importance; but i
t i
s important, and i
t's our
 
school," explains S
ister Ann. For their part, the non-Muslim t
eachers
 
fully support the religious premise of the school, finding i
t
 
compatible with t
heir own deeply held Christian beliefs. The non-Muslim
 
t
eachers are, nonetheless, concerned about the amount of t
ime allotted
 
t
o "
the basics," the core courses r
equired by t
he Washington S
tate
 
Department of Education, for which, a
s certified teachers, they are
 
directly responsible.
 
Yet, even in t
eaching these basic subjects, both teachers
 
consciously include religious principles and the presence o
f Allah in
 
their lessons and in their interaction with the children. During a
 
morning science class, for instance, Mrs. Crum helped her
 
sec ond-through-sixth-grade
 
axis, the planet's movement around the sun, and the relationship of
 
these activities t
o day, night, and seasonal changes. Using a globe and
 
flashlight she and the children portrayed the seasonal changes, talking
 
about their effects on the children's lives. "
When the days are longer,
 
I can play outside more," realized Mubarak.  "
The t
ime for salat
 
changes," recalled Rohymah. Then, bringing an interesting and
 
informative science lesson to a close, Mrs. Crum reminded the children
 
that i
such 
i things 
1
 
25
 
Still, the ranking order of the important subjects and t
he
 
allocation of time to different classes remain potentially serious
 
areas for misunderstanding, even conflict. To be a well-educated Muslim
 
one has to know Arabic. Although the "total immersion" Arabic-language
 
plan for the preschool is as yet unrealized, and the "
truly bilingual,
 
Arabic-English" elementary school program has not been established,  the
 
board remains commmitted to those programs to generate Arabic fluency
 
among the Muslim children. During the final quarter of the 1
981-1982
 
school year, board members supported some changes in the t
eaching day
 
t
o accomodate more Islam in the subject areas, particularly in those
 
associated with the humanities and social sciences. Samia El-Moslimany
 
began coming to the school in the afternoons to lead the classes in art
 
and music, emphasizing Islamic influences, characteristics, and
 
appreciation. In one art project the elementary school children
 
paracticed calligraphy, writing the name "Allah" and then braiding
 
colored streamers to paste onto the decorative handwriting. Mary Abdi,
 
an assistant in the elementary program, assumed full responsibility for
 
the social studies portion of the curriculum during the same quarter.
 
On Fridays Sister Mary would present social studies from an Islamic
 
perspective,' often focusing on a different country from the Muslim
 
world each week.
 
The children aged seven to twelve in Mrs. Crum's class know why
 
they go to the Islamic School of Seattle:  their parents send th
 
are also quite certain why their parents want them to go:  "Here
 
with other Muslims." "At this school I am able to pray." '
.1 can learn
 
26
 
Arabic. I can learn to be a good Muslim." "
The teachers here are good.
 
They are Muslims, like me." The response to my question,  "What classes
 
do you like the most?" was immediate and unanimous--"Arabic!" In our
 
conversations several children suggested other favorites, for example,
 
"Recess!" This response prompted delighted giggles from other
 
classmates who were trying vainly to be serious while being recorded
 
by their now familiar visitor. This distraction aside, all the children
 
focused upon those subjects unique to their school:  studying Arabic,
 
memorizing Qur'anic verses, and working on Islamic art projects. Eager
 
to show me how much Arabic they had learned and to hear their voices on
 
the tape, many of the children volunteered estimates of the s
ize of his
 
or her Arabic vocabulary.
 
As to why they like studying Arabic, Lawrence, an eight-year-old
 
boy quite new to the school responded:  '
,I like Arabic because Allah
 
made this kind of language." Do they practice Arabic at home?  "
Yes,
 
it's the language of our religion," several stressed.
 
All but two of the children now enrolled in the elementary school
 
program had attended one or more schools before coming to the Islami:
 
School of Seattle. Consequently, many of them could offer comparisons
 
of their experience in those schools with that of being a student at
 
the Islamic School.  "At this school we learn English," said Ibrahim, a
 
boy who previously attended a school in Saudi Arabia. Mubarak, an
 
Afro-American, emphasized that at the Islamic School he knew that he
 
would r
eceive "
right lessons." Rohynak, a Cham r
efugee f
rom S
outheast
 
Asia and the oldest girl in the class, observed quietly:  "
We c
ome t
o
 
l
earn t
o be good Muslims."
 
For most of t
he children school hours provide virtually t

o see one another. With the exception of the Chams, who have
 
largely been settled together in c
ity-owned apartment buildings i
n
 
Seattle, and some of the families residing in university or college
 
housing units, most of the children and their families are scattered
 
throughout Seattle. One family l
ives in suburban Kent, necessitating a
 
trip o

ixty miles each day by car so the children can attend school.
 
Several of the children participate in "
Sunday school" at the mosque,
 
l
earning Arabic and religion in c
lasses with some of their c
lassmates.
 
There they are joined by other Muslim children who are not s
tudents at
 
the Islamic school of Seattle. Although there i
s no official
 
relationship between the mosque school and the Islamic School, many of
 
the same people are involved in both. For instance, Sister Samia

Just sixteen more days and we'll be real
 
students!" Jamilla enthusiastically reminded her brother. Asking the
 
children to help me understand what attending the Islamic School of
 
Seattle means to them, I suggested that they attempt to think how each
 
of them might describe their school to a new child, a child of their
 
own age, coming to the school for the first time.
 
Jamilla:
 "
Coming to the Islamic School would be l

coming to a new world.
 
Ibrahim:
 "
I would teach him to pray."
 
Mubarak:
 I would teach him the Arabic alphabet.'
 
Jamilla:
 "We have different subjects."
 
Mubarak:
 "We're Muslims and they're not, but we can
 
still teach them to be good Muslims."
 
Rohymah:

I would show the girls how to cover
 
heads, so they would be comfortable.
