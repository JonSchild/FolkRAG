[Letter from Harold Spivacke to John A. Lomax; Port
Aransas, TX]
February 7, 1939
Mr. John A. Lomax Port Aransas Texas
Dear Mr. Lomax:
I regret that I shall not be able to give you final word regarding the trip until the latter part of
next week. First of all the Librarian is out of town and I shall not be able to see him until the
middle of next week. Secondly, the machine is not in good working order. Alan reported
that it was perfect when he left, but it stopped dead in the middle of the first attempt to play
a record. It may need only a slight adjustment, or it may be more serious. I shall have it
attended to as fast as possible.
Please don't be discouraged by all this as I shall place the matter to the best of my ability
and I am sure that we will catch that Wet Buzzard yet.
With kindest regards,
Sincerely, Harold Spivacke Chief, Division of Music
HS mr
