16E-B1W. F. CUSTER'S LAST CHARGE
Song CUSTER'S LAST CHARGE learned from Robert and Chas. Walker, copiedit from the Custer's
monument in 1906. The tune is probably been coined fromother songs because there don't seem to
be any original tune to the song asfar as I know.
Across the [Dig?] [Big?] [Horn?] Horn's Crystal [crystal?] Tide [tide?] against the savage SiouxA little
band of soldiers charged, three hundred boys in blue;In front rode blond haired Custer, bold pad ?
of the wild frontier,A hero of a hundred fights, his deeds known far and near.Charge, comrades,
charge, there's death ahead, disgrace lurks in our rear;Drive ? deep, come on, come on, came his
yells with ringing cheer,And before those heroes charged, there rose an awful yellIt seemed as /
thought those soldiers stormed the lowest gates of Hell.Three hundred rifles rattled forth and torn
was human form;The black smoke rose in rolling waves above the leaden storm.The death groans
of the dying braves, their wounded ? piercing cries,The hurling of the arrows fleet did? cloud the
noonday skies.The snorting steeds with shrieks of fright, the firearms deafening roarThe war song
sung by the dying braves who fell to rise no more,O'er hill and dale the war song waved round craggy
[mountain?] side,Along down death's dark valley ran a cruel crimson tide. 2 Page 2 CUSTER'S LAST
CHARGE Our blond haired chief was everywhere mid showers of hurling lead.The starry banner
waved above the dying and the dead.With bridle rein and firm set teeth; revolver in each hand,He
hope hoped with his gallant boys to quell the great Sioux band.Again they charged, three thousand
guns poured forth and their life sent fall ball ?, Three thousand war whoops rent the air, gallant
Custer then did fall,And all around where Custer fell ran pools and streams of gore;Heaped bodies
of both red and white whose last great fight was o'er.The boys in blue and their savage foe alike
lay huddled in one mass,Their life's blood ran a trickling through the trampled [ prarie prairie? ]
grass,While fiendish yells did [rend?] [rent?] the air and then a sudden hush,While cries of anguish
rise again as on the mad Sioux rush.O'er those strewn and bloodstained fields those golden ? golding
redskins fly,Our gang went down, three hundred souls, three hundred doomed to die.Those blood-
drunk braves sparang sprang on the dead and wounded boys in blue,Three hundred bleeding scalps
ran high above the fiendish crew.Then night came on with sabled veil and hid those sights from
view ; The [Dig?] Big Horn Horn's Crystal [crystal?] Tide [tide?] was red as she wound her valleys

through , And quickly from the fields of slain, those gloating redskins fled,But blond haired Custer
held the field, a hero with his dead.
