Right before she departed for a much deserved vacation with her faaily,
 
Bees and I jotted down a f
ray measures of organizational success in the folk
 
arts field.  Here they are:
 
1
)  Multi-generational participation in terms of both artists and audiences;
 
2
)  A sizable number of authentic artists -- in good artistic shape -
-
-
actively participating in t
heir art fortis;
 
3
)  A sizable number of ongoing occasions (
public and private) in which the
 
art form can be displayed, studied, and appreciated;
 
4
)  Appropriate recompense for practicing artists (
this may or r
tay not be in
 
cash).

Dear Ulan,
 
The enclosed letter is by way of a formal composition for your resume file or
 
whatever like purpose you might g
rant to put i
t to.  But I didn't want you to
 
think that I had only those purposely stuffy words for you.  You've been a
 
wonderful panelist and a fine friend, and I hope we will not lose track of
 
each other during the coming y
ears.  I expect it will be a long time before
 
you'll want to come up for air from your fascinating and all-consuming job
 
on the Hill, but r
e mmber I
'a, just down the block, so to speak, and would
 
love to see you whenever you've time.
 
I
'm enclosing a couple of Christmas presents, one, the result of a project
 
started, I think, before you came on the panel.  It was a long haul for the
 
.
Klickitats (
trey took about four years to this project) but they finally made
 
it, and I thought in extremely fine style, so that I feel Food when I see it.
 
it is exactly what they g
ranted to have and t
hey did it themselves.  The other
 
is a
uzi Jones' report on the basketry conference, a pretty book and really
 
interesting.  I always thought this a hare-brainod project, but it certainly
 
turned out fine, another indication of how good it is that there is a yolk Arts
 
panell
 
Love to you, dear Ellen, and a marry Christmas,
 
Affectionately always,

Dear Ellen,
 
In accordance with the general policies of the rational Endowment f
or the Arts,
 
the folk Arts Program relies heavily upon the process of peer evaluation as t
he
 
key step in the awarding of grants.  our advisory panels are rotatinz con`re--
gations of distinguished and knowledgeable scholars, artists, and savants;
 
their independent recommendations to the Chairman ensure that our grants-making
 
process is both honorable and responsive to the current state of the art.
 
The three year limitation on the ter= of any panelist is probably wise, but
 
invariably hard on the Program staff, who come to rely upon senior panelists
 
for general advice and counsel.  As Program Director, I would like to say
 
that your particular contribution for the past three years has been exceptional,
 
and it makes the composition of this letter an especially difficult task.
 
Perhaps your most notable contribution to t
he Panel has been the sophisticated
 
and experienced eye you have cast upon our state programs and our artists in
 
schools projects.  I also greatly appreciated t
he work you did in connection
 
with the various site visits you made on our bahalf and your eloquent repre-
sentation of the Program's position before the National Council and in the
 
public press.  I hope you will consent to c
ontinue helping us in some capacity
 
from tine to time as t
he demands of your new position permit.  I do rely
 
heavily on the counsel of former senior panelists such as yourself.
 
Speaking; both for the Program staff and t
he ongoing panelists, thank you for
 
your wisdom, your fairness, and your dedication during your past three years
 
of service on the Folk Arts advisory panel.  You will be sorely missed.  It
 
has been a real privilege to work with you.

Dear Ms. Chesney.
 
Thank you for your letter of November 29 to our Folk Arts Program.
 
Several weeks ago I had a long discussion of your plans with Jeff Pryor,
 
in which we went over many of the purposes, priorities, and concerns of
 
our program and panelists ,
 and how they lined up with what you are
 
proposing to do.  In ahort, our program aims to assist authentic traditional
 
artists and arts of high quality.  Our panelists tend to give preference to
 
the honoring and presentation of local traditional artists, rather than
 
importing outside artists.  And very important in effectively presenting;
 
artistic traditions in cross-cultural settings (where the audience may not
 
be familiar with the traditional art form) is cultural expertise in helping
 
the audience best appreciate what they me witnessing.
 
Another concern may turn out to be the essentially historical reconstruction
 
setting for the proposed demonstrations.  We
, try to get the message across
 
that traditional arts are not relegated to the past and are not moribund,
 
but rather live on as an important aspect i
n the lives of many.  The 19th
 
century mining camp atmosphere may make it difficult to do this.
 
Finally, I would suggest that you get in touch with Jeff Pryor to review
 
what we cos
teered in our conversation, and then if you have any further questions,
 
feel free to call me at 202/682-5449.  If you call as person-to-perssou collect
 
and leave your name and number, I will return your call as goon as I a
te able.

Dear Mr. Montana,
 
In response t
o your recent letter, the Folk Arts Program received s letter on
 
April 7th of this year from Dr. ?
1aurice M. Martinez, nominating you for a
 
National Heritage Fellowship.  On October 17th, we received a letter from
 
picholas Spitzer, Director of the Louisiana Folklife Program at the Louisiana
 
State Arts Council, supporting your nomination. and on November 8th, a similar
 
letter from Mr. 1
A
.
ichael P
. Smith.  When I reread t
he Spitzer and Smith letters
 
just now, it is clear that both writers knew that you had already been r
+ominsted.
 
I do not know how they knew this and can only/ suppose that Dr. ;
Martinez told
 
them and asked them to write support letters i
f they agreed to his views on
 
the excellence of your art.
 
Mr. Montana, I have never met any of these t
hree people except for Nicholas
 
Spitzer  and have absolutely no way of knowing if they are black or white.
 
The ?
rational heritage Fellowship program is designed t
o do honor to the many
 
important artistic leaders in the many varied cultural traditions that exist
 
in the United States, and any resident of this country can make or second a
 
nomination.  (
please sea t
he enclosed brochures.)
 
Finally, I do not know what leads you to state that Black artists are not
 
receiving ,
rational Endowment for the Arts grants, but your information is
 
incomplete.  The Folk Arts Program has funded Black film--makers and Black
 
artists for a variety of projects during our seven years of existence and we
 
currently have two e
ssinent Black scholars on our reviewing panel.  I am
 
proud of our record in defense of .
Black
. artists, Black art forms. and Black
 
culture.
 
I sh
,all of course honor whatever decision you eventually make, but I hope,
 
upon reflection, you will choose to keep your name available to us.  The
 
Heritage program has. I believe
., done some good, especially in those
 
com  aitias where the senior artists have gone unrecognized and unappreciated
 
by their own youth.  This may not be the situation within the Black
. Indian
 
culture, I would still hope, whether you elect to remain eligible for a
 
?
rational Heritage fellowship or not, that we could work together to see i
i some
 
other part of your prograta night be eligible for federal funding.

Dear nano-Feygl Abraham.
 
Thank you for your letter of November 22 to our Folk Arts Program concerning
 
your plans for the recording of Yiddish folk songs.
 
Your plans may or may not be eligible for funding under our program guidelines,
 
depending on a few things.  We, of course, concentrate our funding efforts on
 
the thoroughly traditional folk arts, which in the case of music would mean
 
traditional songs performed by traditional folk artists in a traditional manner.
 
The line items in your tentative budget for the arranger and relatively large
 
production staff lead me to wonder if the manner of rendition of the songs is
 
precisely in the spirit of traditionality that we describe in our guidelines.
 
Perhaps it is, perhaps not,  it is difficult for me to tell, judging solely
 
from your letter.
 
In regard to your budget, keep in mind that we offer 502 matching
* grants.  That
 
is, we can fund  up to, but not more than, half of the total project costs.  If
 
you have a $16,000 project, you should not request more than $8,000 from us.
 
Also, the projected production costs (record pressing, jacket, and booklet) at
 
$3,300 for 5
,000 albums seems very such on the loin side.  Have you obtained
 
estimates from professional companies?
 
Finally, have you looked into plans for distributing the proposed album?  The
 
manner of distribution will be of great inportanCe to our proiram advisory
 
panelists when they review all the applications.
 
If you would like to discuss your plans by telephone, you may call s
ae person-to-
person collect at 202/682-5449, leave your name and number, and I will return

Dear Mr. f

Thank you for your letter of October 31.  Unfortunately, the National Endowment

Indeed, I do not believe there is a federal agency that does so; most federal
 
money for scholarships goes directly to the universities for their distribution,
 
and there is sadly little to go round in these austere days.
 
I wish I could be of help.  I shall enclose a copy of the brochure that explains
 
what the Polk Arts Program in the National Endowment for the Arts does do, Just
 
for your general interest.  You will see that even in the folk Arts Program ve
 
do not pay for people to go to colloge to study art, only for an occasional
 
appren%iceship with a traditional artist.
 
4th all best wishes for your success in attending the university of your choice.

bear Nick,
 
It's been so long you've probably forgotten all about it by worn, but I did want
 
to thank you for your participation in the panel on state folk arts programs at
 
the NA&AA meeting.  I got lots of favorable comments -- more significantly, several
 
previously uncommitted state people came up and told s
ae they really thought they
 
should got to work on setting a state program iapplace -- would you believe,
 
South R
aekotal  Oklahomal  South Carolinal  Oregon!!!  I really was tickled.
 
As always, your special part of the program ws mooterfully handled, and I think
 
the four of us got some important points across.  Thanks again .
.
_ hope your film
 
vent well and that you got a chance to have some fun at AFS.
 
Affectionatraly always,
 
Bess Lomax Eaves

Dear Catherine,
 
Thanks for your nice letter.  I
'm not the best person to advise you on publications,
 
since I
've published relatively little myself.  I tend to consult ?
fenny Goldstein,
 
whose experience is pretty extensive, also Roger Abrahams; but you malt not feel
 
you know them wall enough.  Let's talk about it at the Library of Congress meeting.
 
There surely will be some people
s there who could give you some up-tp-date advice.
 
My ova impression is that the best places for you to sand your long manuscript
 
are
a the university presses -- the University of Nebraska, the University of
 
Tennessee and the University of Texas seem to be pretty active just judging
, by
 
the mailings I receive.  Don't forget the University of Newfoundland.  That
 
H
aight be the best; people do so love to read about themselves.
 
I don't think you need worry about copyright, both the longer version and the
 
short would be separately copyrighted if published.  By all means go ahead and
 
get a short version to the Smithsonian; it might help sell the longer, it seems
 
to me.  I
'd also recommend that you do soa
ve trimming before you send the manuscript
 
off for a review, tighter is always better.
 
Congratulations for being appointed to the New York State panel.  It's fun being
 
a panelist, isn't it?  And I
'm also happy the quilt exhibit is coming along; so
 
wall.  Don't forget about sending us a heritage nomination or two should you run
 
into a really sterling seamstress.
 
I
'll be looking
; forward to seeing you in Washington at the Library.  We'll have
 
to have a formally scheduled visit perhaps since we start a panel meeting the
 
very day after the conference, and you know what that deans.  Still, we'll get to
 
exchange a hug at least.
 
Affectionately always,

Dear Christina,
 
I am startled to realize that Thanksgiving is nearly upon us, and the issues
 
raised in my letter to you of August 9
, 1983 have still not been resolved.  I
 
understand that state bureaucracies, like federal ones, revolve slowly, but I
 
am concerned that the holidays will soon be here and than there will only be a
 
month until the start date of the next Rhode Island folk arts grant (
2/2/84).
 
During the next two months, my  owe► office will be involved in a major grants
 
review panel and t
he preparation of a tive year plan along with the usual spate
 
of staff holidays.  I am sure RISCA Will be equally enraged.
 
With all the possibilities for confusion during such a busy period, I have taken
 
the step of putting an administrative hold on your 1953 grant (
grant number
 
32-5530-00200) . This simply means that I will be notified when you send in a
 
cash request, so that I can at that time assure myself that the problem of
 
Dr. Winifred Lambrecht's salary and the appropriate disposition
_ of the sut
-M
 
earmarked but not paid her in previous folk Arts grants has been taken care of.
 
Please be assured that this does not mean that the grant is being withdrawn.
 
It is simply another indication of our serious concern over this long--standiug
 
problss and of our determiastion that it not drag into t
he next granting period.
 
I remain convinced that the issues can be resolvedl  It is not as though you did
 
:
not have an outstanding folic arts program+ of which both the state of Rhode Island
 
and the ;
rational Endowment should be very proud.
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Al,
 
Just a note to thank you for your hospitality at the HASAA meeting, and a special
 
word of congratulations for an extremely pleasant meeting.  Everyone thought the
 
physical conditions were more than comfortable, the schedule ran remarkably
 
smoothly, and this boat ride was a gas.  I expect you were proud of hick, too;
 
his presentation at the folk arts coordinator/program panel was masterful and I
 
heard more favorable remarks about the panel of Louisiana artists than any other
 
single feature of the Conference.
 
It was really a pleasure to visit New Orleans again.  Thanks for making it such
 
a warm and sociable occasion.  Be sure to tell all your hardvorkint staff how
 
much their e
fforts were appreciated.
 
Sincerely yours,

I hope you were pleased.

I
 want to let you know t
hat Mr. Lang Rangsith's beautiful carving did indeed
 
reach t
he F
alk Arts Program at the s
tational Endowment for the Arts, and that
 
i
t occupies an honored place in our offices.  We are truly grateful for the gift
 
and delighted to have such a representation of t
he
, Laotian woodcarver's art.
 
I
t has been a p
leasure and an horror for us to have supported Mr. Lang in his
 
t
eaching.  Does he i
ntend t
o continue his work with you?  I hope that he can
 
go on presenting his traditions to young people whether through formal instruction,
 
exhibition or other ;
Reja"a and I hope you will let us know i
f the Folk Arts Program
 
can be of further assistance in this work.  I shall enclose a copy of t
he Folk

I am not sure i
f Mr. Lan, speaks 2nglish, but I would appreciate it, even so, i
f
 
you could present bim with the enclosed personal note.  I t

he carving o
f the dragon t
hat you sent us i
s of the highest

and sculpture.
 
It has been been an honor for the Polk Arts Program to assist with some o

eaching your art to younger apprentices.  Please
 
give q
ty t
hm*s and appreciation also to your teaching assistant, Sitpaseuth

I hope t

in your fine work . You are indeed a master artist.

From: Dees Haves , POIk Arts
 
Subject : Data gathering (Annex V);  Folk Arts
 
As usual, we don 't really fit, and though I
've tried, within the time allotment
 
I just can 't work out how to set this up the way you suggested . So here are my
 
reactions , anyway. I hope they will fit somewhere.
 
1
.
)  Concerning the Data Gathering Clusters. I don 't quite see why Folk Arts and
 
Expansion Arts are lumped together unless it is supposed to be a multi--discipline
 
category.  In that case ,
 where is Iuter-Arts? Personally , I think Polk Arts is
 
sui  
jrenerie ,
 but read on...
 
2
)  Concerning the folk Arts Institutions sub-cate_Oriez (
page 3)
. I would
 
recommend eliminating "Enseobless" . As of now, we do gt
  have any.  "Producers and
 
Presenters" is okay , but you might consider adding; (or substituting) the term
 
"Centers "
,
, 
 more cee mnly used in the field.  Centers produce and present but also
 
house collections and serve as locations for study and informatiou-distribution.
 
3
)  Concer
n
� Valk Arts iustitutions per me. The following institutions are
 
concerned exclusively with folk arts as defined in the Folk Arts guidelines and
 
all are over ten years old.
 
National Council on the Traditional Arts
 
(
formerly, 4
vat' 1
. Folk Festival Aeon.)
 
Ethnic Folk Arts Center
 
(
formerly , Balkan Arts Society)
 
Center for Southern Folklore
 
Washington. DC
 
New York, '
Jew York
 
Memphis , Tennessee
 
Blue Ridge Institute
 Verrum, Virginia
 
4
)  Concerning public agency folk arts institutions. These have developed out
 
of t
he folk arts coordinator program but have grown into independence and are
 
actually public (state or locally based) agencies with two or more full time staff.
 
Because of their origins within the Folk .
'a
rts program ,
 none are over five years
 
old.  They f
unction as sulti-purpose centers, housing fol
ic arts collections and/or
 
libraries , producing festivals , exhibits, and media programs, setting up school
 
residencies for folk artists, providing a full range of technical assistance.
 
x
 
They are extremely important to Folk Arts in terms of charting
 
years, but I do not know i
f or how they sight be included in a
 
Withir
, t
his group, I think of
 
Florida Folklife Center
 
Center for Southwestern Lore
 
Utah Folklife Center
 
*Missouri Cultural Heritage Center
 
(only one year old)
 
out the neat five
 
statistical
.
 
Gainesville, Florida
 
Tucson, Arizona
 
Salt Lake City, Utah
 
Columbia, Missouri
 
survey.
 
I cannot omit the two highly productive federal institutions under this rubric:
 
the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and the Office of
 
Felklife Programs at the Smithsonian Institution.  Both have significant budgets
 
and function, in terms of producing exhibits, festivals, concerts and t
he like,
 
much like the before-me
ntioned state centers.
 
5
)  Concerning "cooperating" organizations.  These are institutions that play
 
significant roles in terms of folk arts but pursue other arts as well.  We do
 
most of our business with such institutions.  There are important folk arts
 
collections ] for example, in many major museums such as the Field Museum and
 
Winterthur; sisilarly we may fund such organisations as the Maine Festival of
 
the Arts or the Institute of the American West to put a high-quality folk arts
 
component into their lar,^
-
_er more general events.  It occurs to r
ye that it might
 
be possible to include these mixed organizations under other of your clusters.
 
For example.
 
ft
fseums 
Museum
. of American Folk Art
 New York City
 
Museum of International Folk Art
 Santa 8e, New Yexico
 
(
They contain major collections but buckets of other stuff as well ----pop art,
 
and naive art, particularly, as well as 18th and 19th century collections,
 
therefore they rarely come to us for funding and tend, quite properly, to go to
 
the Museum Program for their support.)
 
Media Arts
 
Appalshop
 Whitesburg, Kentucky
 
Documentary Educational Resources
 Boston, }
►aasachusetts
 
(
Both organizations produce a lot of folk arts films and projects as well as
 
non-folk arts and non-arts related documentaries.)
 
Commercial
 
*'raditiora2 Arts Services
 Seattle, Washington
 
(
This is our first, and I hope not our last, successful professional booking
 
agency for folk and revivalist artists; Jobn Ullman has developed a computerized
 
booking service that has really served the field well, on the yea
st coast especially.)
 
E ps
asion Arts
 
*Akwesasne 1
-
iuseum
 Hogansburg, l
:ew York
 
Institute of Alaska I
l
lative Arts
 Fairbanks, Alaska
 
(
both of these are native arts organizations that do mostly folk arts projects
 
but a
lso are concerned with contemporary art forms, training in arts administration
 
and the like.  Besides, they don't consider themselves folk arts organizations.)
 
K
 3 -
 
Dance
 
Ar
ran Ensemble
 Los Angeles, California
 
Duquesne Tamburitaans
 Pittsburg, Pennsylvania
 
(
Both organizations are professional troupes presenting stylized and choreographed
 
works developed out of indigenous folk dance.  They fit well into the Dance folk/
 
ethnic category.)
 
t
oost of the above institutions are reasonably venerable (
5--10 years) except the
 
few I
've narked with an asterisk.
 
6
)  ConcerninS feasibility of collectin? trend data.  I believe that even the
 
long-term "pure" folk arts institutions will be incapable of producing such a
 
welter of statistical information on d
emand, and I recommend in the strongest
 
terms t
hat the data element* be pared down to t
e
en or twelve statistically
 
significant pieces of information t
hat any tax-
-exempt organization might be
 
reasonably expected to have on hand and be able to produce on d
enand.  There
 
just won't be any tizee for long periods of self-examination and data amassing.
 
I hopes the above i
e
a at least moderately useful and doesn't seem like Folk Arts
 
coming on as '
 special` once again.  Please don't hesitates to let me know i
f
 
you think additional information could be helpful.

Subject:  Folk Arts Service Organization Paper
 
As we agreed on the phone this morning. Folk Arts really does not have a service
 
organization.  We have simply persuaded tha
n only locally-based national organization
 
we have to undertake an evaluation and technical assistance contract for us.  The
 
National Council for the Traditional Arts, however, remains a producing and pre-
senting organization, as can be seen by t
he funding history since 1978 (
attached).
 
They performed during this period no additional service organization functions,
 
with the single exception of some work done under a contract with the national
 
Park Ssrvics for which they produced folk festivals and concert presentations in
 
various parks as well as performing specified technical, artistic, and managerial
 
assistance duties.  This contract relation began in 1973 and has continued at
 
approximately the $50,000 level since that time.  It is not a consultancy, but a
 
contract for specific services to be rendered.
 
Conc+arniu- the policy sLatament on service organizations, i
t seems clear, vc11  
organized and thorough,  I have had limited experience with the problems being
 
considered under that report but from what I know about them, I believe this
 
report is a
< good instrument for dealing; with them.
 
Please let v
ia know if you need additional informations.

Subject:  Attached article
 
You may recall meeting last summer with a group representing various park and
 
recreation professional associations.  I was out of town at the time, but I
 
believe Dan Sheehy represented Folk Arts at the occasion.
 
I thought you might like to seeA 
one constructive result from the time you put
 
in.  The enclosed article just reached me out of the blue.  I think it is a
 
nice piece of journalism, representing some effort and independent investigation
 
on the part of the reporter and indicating some real interest on the part of
 
the National Recreation and Parks Association, which is one of the major
 
organizations in the field.
 
Thanks again for your steady support.

Dear
 
Thank you for your letter concerning the Heritage Awards.  We have come a long way
 
from the first year (
only two years ago) when Dan Sheehy, Bob Teske and I had to
 
get on the phone and urge nominations from anybody for anybody.  Many coordinators
 
told me at that time that they didn't intend to nominate but preferred to wait and
 
"see what happened".  There were times that first year when I thought we might not
 
be able to pull out a slate worth presenting, but I guess we did.
 
I agree with you that during the Heritage program's two years, the midwestern
 
states, the western states, and European ethnics have been under-represented in
 
terms of their national significance and presence.
 I might also add that Native
 
Americans are even more poorly represented, New England is pretty disgraceful,
 
and Asian-Americans, Alaskans and the entire Pacific area have not so far been
 
represented at all.  Your letter, however, seems to suggest that this unsatis-
factory state of affairs represents some covert prejudice on the part of the panel
 
and the Folk Arts staff.  On behalf of the distinguished scholars on the panels
 
who worked so damn hard over the past three years to come up with the two lists
 
of traditional artists so far presented, I have to reject that conclusion.  The
 
cause of the difficulty, it seems to me, is the historic disproportion of scholarly
 
research and attention to any area of American folklore other than the several
 
principal concerns of the southeast, especially Appalachia and the Black south,
 
English language folk music, and English language tale-types and motifs.
 
Let me elaborate.
 In preparing to answer your letter, I started to do a statistical
 
analysis of the nominations we have received, both geographically and by ethnicity,
 
but soon realized that simple numbers would be misleading in terms of our joint
 
concerns.  A really high number of the nominations for European ethnics, for
 
example, were for non-traditional, often self-taught artists with very little
 
backup or appropriate support material presented.  The same kind of nomination
 
came in for southeastern artists, to be sure, but for every inappropriate contemporary
 
song-writer from Kentucky (
just to give an example) there are five strong, well-
documented nominations prepared by knowledgeable specialists more often than not
 
accompanied by scholarly articles.  The proportions are sadly skewed.
 
I earnestly urge you, as scholars concerned with European ethnic arts, to continue
 
to nominate the finest artists you can locate, and to make those nominations as
 
strong as possible, bearing in mind that the most diligent reviewing scholar may
 
not, because of the state of the field, know as much about how to distinguish the
 
ultimate in Polish pysanky or Ukrainean Easter eggs as you do.  The panel needs
 
A
 
- 2 -
 
more help in making some of these determinations, and we are trying to work out
 
ways to have scholar specialists give us special reviews in the case of the less
 
widely-known traditions.
 I hope also that you will encourage other scholars east
 
of the Mississippi to send in nominations.  You would be shocked at how few we
 
have received.
 
Concerning your specific suggestions, we are always looking for appropriate
 
panelists and would welcome any suggestions (
accompanied by vitae if possible).
 
Please bear in mind that our panelists have to be experienced in one or more
 
art forms (music, dance, craft, tale) as well as in one or more "culture areas,"
 
American Indian, Black, Asian, etc.  I find far fewer folklorists than one might
 
imagine who have this kind of background.
 I am also required by this administration
 
to construct a panel that balances geography, minority status (
Black, Hispanic,
 
Native American), and sex, and that includes at least one person from the business
 
world, a private foundation representative, a trustee and a State Arts Agency
 
director.
 In order to effectively review our projects, we also need someone with
 
museum experience, someone used to putting on festivals and concerts, besides a
 
person with extensive media background (
recordings and film).  Obviously most of
 
our 12 panelists have to be switch-hitters, with more than one desirable characteristic.
 
Putting a professionally respectable panel together and getting it approved is the
 
most delicate job the Folk Arts Program accomplishes each year, and I begin muttering
 
and praying over it a good s
ix months in advance.  Any help you could give would be
 
welcome.
 
Your notion of starting state heritage award programs that would be forwarded on
 
to the national is interesting.  I think Utah may have beat you to the draw, and
 
it might be worth your getting in touch with Hal Cannon to find out how the idea
 
is working out there.  I have to tell you that bringing off a good program of
 
this type is full of pitfalls.  It just is easier to approve projects than people,
 
and please do think about that for a minute.  Heritage awards, no matter how
 
muted the rhetoric, suggest that"x" individual may somehow be more worthy than
 
'
Y"individual.  Within a national perspective, I think we may be able to get away
 
with this and still do what we want to do -- to turn the attention of the United
 
States towards the extraordinary concentration of verying artistic traditions that
 
we host in these fortunate shores.  On a state (
closer, more personal) level, the
 
idea may be more troublesome, more productive of inter-group hostility and anger.
 
Anyway, think it over.  As far as our "encouraging" such efforts on a state level,
 
it seems to me that it would be better for us to respond happily when such an
 
idea reaches us rather than to take the initiative.  But maybe I
'm wrong.  I would
 
appreciate further correspondence on this point.
 
When the workload slackens a bit, I may be able to get you some more actual
 
statistics on the points you raise.  Right now, with only a staff of six (
including
 
me) we're awfully busy.
 Should you ever find yourself in Washington, I
'd be happy
 
to open our files to you for whatever statistical survey you'd like to conduct.
 
Until then, I hope you will continue to think about the Heritage Fellowships and
 
nominate the very most deserving people you can find.
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Dirk,
 
This letter has been an unconscionable time in the writing, and I
'm sorry.
 
Mostly I didn't quite know what to say except that we'd better back up and take
 
another run at your ideas, and I didn't really want to say that.  Finally, I
 
pot in touch with Dr. Lockhart in !
.ubbock and we had a good long talk.  I
'm
 
sending him a copy of this, and maybe the three of us working
; together can
 
finally get these projects properly considered.
 
Let me take they storyboard application first.  The panel will want to see the
 
following:
 
a
.  Evidence: that somebody in Palau wants this to happen.  Bill Lockhart
 
says that Tina Rechuher was involved in the original ides, and that she has
 
offered to have the classes at the Palau Museum.  Could you get a statement
 
from ber to that affect?  It sure would help.
 
b
.  Evidence that there are some master carvers who will cooperate and
 
some young people who will learn.  Some names of possible master carvers and
 
a bit about there would help.  We can't just throw the money out there.
 
c
.  Some kind of further planning information.  It is not clear what kind
 
of "
training" you are giving the waster carvers;, or are you training them at all?
 
Maybe just the interns?  How many interns do you anticipate?  How long will the
 
sessions be?  How many days?  What is the difference between the first three months
 
and the last three months?  Will Dr. Lockhart have to go home then?  Who will
 
continue to supervise the project, or will that be necessary?  What happens
 
after the 6 months?
 
d
.  Turning to the budget, who are the assistants?  Who is t
he assistant
 
corning from Los Angeles and for what purpose?  Is there any way to handle the
 
discrepancy between Dr. Lockhart's salary and the master carvers, interns and
 
assistants?  (
It is probably quite reasonable but the panel is very sensitive
 
about even t
he appeararmt
.e of exploitation.  And we do really try to pet a (
rood
 
chunk of the money back to the folks...)  We will have to redo the budget anyway,
 
because you didn't include your inkind contributions in the total project costs,
 
meaning the whole thin; will come to around $
40,000, a pretty hefty sure for us.
 
Finally, we notice that you put in an indirect cost figure from t
he University
 
but no indication of rate or base.  This will have to be cleared up eventually.
 
Do you think you could get the University to donate that tack in?  Some do and
 
every little bit helps.
 
2
 
I realize this may sound like a humongous arount of work, but it all can just be
 
added into the file, you don't have to start all over.  budget details can be
 
worked out over the phone with our ,
sterling Grants officer, I
ts. Rose :
,organ who
 
has handled ;
problems much stickier than yours.  Call her person-to-
•pe
arszra
 
collect At  202/682-5449 and she'll get hack to you.  Dirk, let me say that in
 
your application, you rade an all-too--common mistake;  you spent most of your
 
efforts trying to establish need.  We pretty much take need for granted around
 
here -- you'd be appalled how little notional attention goes to native arts of
 
any variety.  What we must have is evidence that you're going to meet that need
 
with some really carefully-thought-out actions, and that the local people have
 
been involved in the planning and will be involved in the execution.  I an kind
 
of proud of the fact that this program has said from the very begt*
.ning that we
 
were not out to lay anything on anybody, just to help with some hard cash when
 
the planning seems right and everyboOy is ready to go.
 
All of the above strictures apply also to the second (
tattooing) application,
 
only here it seems to me you have a much worse problem.  In order to m
otet our
 
requirement of some expression of local interest and desire that the project be
 
done, that nice young tattoo artist would have to go and visit every island, it
 
seo s to s
ae, during which time he eight as well go ahead and have his workshops
 
anyway.  Frankly -- and I think this is why 1 have stalled over this letter for
 
so long -- I think you have beat me with this proposition.  I have always prided
 
myself on being able to work the bureaucratic system to produce what the people
 
want, but I haven't found a (
single glimmer of an idea on how to do this one.
 
The gentleman who wants to do the project is not a Micronesian, we have no
 
indication that anybody on all these islands wants him to come and teach theca,
 
we don't ordinarily approve of projects where Augloss go teach natives their own arts
 
anyway, and he owuld have to prove a real need in order for our panel to back it,
 
the islands he wants to go to are outside of the official area of concern for
 
this agency, and damned if I know if I could persuade not only the entire :
yolk
 
Arts panel but the entire National Council an the Arts and our Congressional
 
oversight committee that tattooing; in '
Micronesia is a problem demanding the
 
expenditure of federal dollars.  Frankly, g
ay heart fails a
ce.  I shall take the
 
application fo the Polk Arts panel because it is, in ay cpinton, the right of
 
every American to petition his government, but I don't really have much hope,
 
and I personally believe we should turn out joint intellivences to trying to
 
figure out another way to do this particular job.  '
Grants are not the only
 
ans wer to all problems:, nor the only possibility.
 
well, I do hope we can bulldoze our g
ray through with at least the Palauan project,
 
though time is short.  I
'll keep in touch with Dr. Lockhart, who seems a very
 
nice fellow and whoplivasa in one of my old horse towns!, I have had several
 
interesting meetings with Annie Stone and her husband and Kelp Our
-know, all of
 
whoa were: here for a state arts agerucy shindig, in t

Dear Joe.
 
It was great to hear from you.  It was a pleasure to have you here last summer with
 
Simon St. Pierre, and we will always be grateful for your participation.  Bess has
 
been tied up with a monstrous five--7ear plan required by our administration, so she
 
has asked me to fill you in on funding possibilities for your planar.
 
I feel your i
dea is basically a very good one.  While you're deliberating about
 
applying for a grant, you should take into consideration a couple of things about
 
what we have supported in the past in the way of records.  First of all, the way
 
we got into the record business in the first place was to help out in the area
 
that was most financially prohibitive for the producers of good folk music records,
 
descriptive notes.  So, our advisory panel, the people who vote on the grant
 
applications, will want to know a lot about the content of those accompanying
 
notes and the writer's writing ability.  You could either give us a sampling of
 
your writing, or collaborate with a folklorist or someone like that -- Sandy Ives

Another aroa of concern would be the technical duality of recording.  You would
 
need to send us a tape example of something you had recorded, or you could work
 
with a recordist and submit some of his/hor work.  The other two wain things we
 
would need to know are the contents of the record (
as B
auch as you can) and your
 
plans for distributing it.
 
Another thing -- would you apply through Arts Rochester, and are they a federally
 
non--profit organization?
 
I am sorry I have to hit you with all these questions/requests, but when it cores
 
to spending taxpayers' money, a lot of care and thoroughness go along with it.
 
If you want to talk over your plans by phone, give me a call.  If you call me
 
person-to-person collect at 202/682-5449 and leave your name and number, I will
 
call you back and if won't cost you anything.

Subject:  Conference in Venezuela
 
I very such appreciate your help in getting me to the First Inter-American Congress
 
on Ethnomusicology and Folklore in Caracas.  I found it most instructive.  It was
 
the first get-together on a large scale of professional people from all parts of
 
the Americas working to promote folk arts and folklife, and there was much opportu-
nity for sharing concerns, strategies, successes, and failures.
 
A awmary of the general sentiments and specific recommendations that emerged out
 
of the congress is being put together by the Inter-American Center for Ethnomusicology
 
and Folklore in Caracas, and it will soon be distributed by the OAS Department of
 
Cultural Affairs to all the member nations.  I would be very happy to share it with
 
you when my copy arrives.
 
On the whole, I found that we have much in co=aon with our Latin and Caribbean
 
colleagues -- concern for the health and self--development of ethnic cultural
 
tradition*, a desire to heighten awareness of the beauty and value of indigenous
 
art for m, and attempts to teach the appreciation and practice of folk arts via
 
educational institutions, to name a few.  Strategies to deal with problems in
 
most of the other countries, though, are determined in great part by their highly
 
centralized and ministerial government structures and by their more monochromatic
 
cultural nature,  Their rhetoric often is couched in terms of promoting nationalism
 
and defending the national heritage in the face of cultural encroachment by outside
 
forces, commercial "imperialism" in particular.
 
As you can imagine, all this generated much valuable discussion that I would love
 
to share with any and all interested.

)  The Public Sector section of the American Folklore Society is doing a study
 
of the various state folk arts coordinators and their programs.  This study was
 
undertaken at the request of the Folk Arts Program and solicits information
 
that we need as well as information the section itself wanted.  The results are
 
now being assembled and the entire report will be made available to the National
 
Council on the Arts at the February Council meeting.
 
The methodology simply involves a written questionnaire.  Vie areas of
 
enquiry include:  history of the folk arts program in each state
 
content and emphasis of the program's activities in each state
 
fiscal impact of the program in each state
 
suggestions for program improvement and future plans
 
The final report will contain a history of the entire effort to establish state
 
based folk arts programs tables  (not state-by-state) and an analysis of the
 
data produced.  Thirty-tJo states are participating; (
three have received federal
 
support but are still recruiting their coordinators so have no program to report
 
on).
 
Folk Arts will probably undertake a similar study of the various states that are
 
conducting folk-artists-
-in-schools projects, but will not begin this activity until
 
the coordinator study has been completed and results published, probably in
 
February of 1984.

)  The .
Folk Arts Program will possibly repeat its highly successful Irish and
 
Cowboy tours during calendar 1984, but the applications have: not yet been
 
rcv-lewed by Council, so it might be premature to mention except as initiatives
 
we hope to continue.
 
Folk Arts panel will review in December the first applications received under our
 
state--based apprenticeship program initiative.  We have so far received eleven
 
applications from eleven state arts agencies, all thoughtfully planned and of
 
good quality.  We predict this initiative will prove to be a highly productive
 
and popular venture on the Arts Endowment's part.

Subject:  Program Directors' meeting
;
 
T
dhat with the Five Year Planning process and the required foray against
 
corruption and waste, it appears that the next few months will be extremely
 
busy for program directors.  I
'd like to make a few suggestions for ameliorating
,
 
our lives during the period:
 
1
)  that we continue to have our normal program directors' meetings.
 
Our day-to-day business will not stop during
, November and December and there
 
are day-to-day issues that could well be discussed, in addition to the Plan
 
and the Investigation.
 
2
)  That meetings, when announced, should include an approximate time
 
length.  This would give us a fighting chance of arranging our schedules
 
so that our ordinary program responsibilities could be acquitted.
 
3
)  That no planning meeting where discussion is requested involve more
 
than 12-15 people.  It is very difficult to hear when everyone is spread out
 
over long spaces, and many people are unwilling to talk when there are so
 
many others who might just as well be speaking.  Big meetings should be
 
reserved for announcements, primarily.
 
I do believe the above ideas might make our meetings more productive and
 
morale-building.  Just a suggestion....

Dear Mr. Croton,
 
It was a pleasure to meet with you the other day and to talk over the possibility
 
of a folk arts coordinator position in Los Angeles.  What a great ,
job that could
 
be!
 
I am enclosing a few things that might be of use -
-
-
- a list of places where such
 
a position might fruitfully be advertised, and a stack of position descriptions
 
and position requirements drawn up by various states and localities.  We're not
 
recommending any of the latter, just sending them- along in case they contain any
 
useful i
deas or formulations.  Each area. we find, produces its own individual
 
requirements and description and I
'm so pleased that that's the way i
t is.  This
 
i
s an area where uniformity is pretty deadly.
 
By the way, I realized to my embarrassment after you left that I had not mentioned
 
to you the name of Dr. Jacqueline D
jeD,je, professor of ethnomusicology at UCLA
 
who is currently a m
ember of the Folk Arts panel.  She was born in south Georgia
 
and has taught at Fisk; she knows black rural music quite well and might be an
 
appropriate r
-ember of your advisory group.  She is married to a Ghanaian political
 
scientist, I believe, who also teaches at UCLA.  Should you want to reach her, you
 
could address her at UCLA, where her phone number is 2
13/825--4761.  I think she
 
eight be most helpful.

Dear Ms. Sinavaiana,
 
I am enclosing a number of =aterials that I hope might be of help to you.  But
 
let me first say haw pleased I was to hear from you, and how excited I am that
 
you are developing
; a program on S wan/Pacific Studies.  Besides, it's great fun
 
to run into old acquaintances from my Berkeley days.  Frankly, I can't quite
 
place your husband, but I am sure if we were to meet that we'd have many shared
 
memories of that extraordinary program.
 
1 ax enclosing first a copy of the Folk Arts brochure as well as .
an application
 
form, and a list of grants that we funded during 1982.  Sometimes just looking
,
 
through what a granting agency does do clarifies all the verbiage better than
 
anything else.  Frankly, most of what you want to do would not fit the Arts
 
Endowment.  The National Endowment for the Arts is supposed to try to get money
 
out to support artists and various kinds of arts events -- concerts, exhibits,
 
and so on.  Since the area of folk arts ie pretty specialized, we have been able
 
to gat the Endowment to fund research where it is essential in order to produce
 
a high quality folk arts event or conduct a survey in order to locate appropriate
 
artists or something of the sort.  But the research component has to be clearly
 
ancillary to something that will eventually come out of the activity -- a recording,
 
an exhibit, a festival, etc.
 
The National Endowment for the Humanities, however, does fund research, curriculum
 
development, archives upgrading and all those good things that you mention in
 
your letter.  So I have been in touch with two people in the Humanities -- Dr.
 
Sally Yerkovich (Phil in Anthropology and Folklore from the University of Pennsylvania)
 
and Dr. Donald Gibson, who is director of the Office of State Programs.  They've
 
given me the Publications Program and Research Resources Program guidelines as
 
well as the Overview of the Humanities brochure.  They suggest you try to absorb
 
this material and then write either one or both.  Should you decide to a ply through
 
the Research Program, the person you should contact is Jeff Field, Assistant
 
Director of Research Resources.  The publication material will probably not be
 
useful right now but might be helpful later on.
 
I believe if I were you I
'd try to digest all this stuff and then figure out a
 
number of things you want to do that can be fitted into several of t
he Procrustean
 
beds being offered you.  Write then in an informal letter and send a copy to me
 
and Sally.  We'll try to get back with further reactions and suggestions plus t
he
 
necessary deadline information and all that.

Finally, I will be having a meeting with Yatilda Lolotai, director of the
 
Samoan Arts Agency November 1
.  If I have further ideas or information for
 
you, I
'll gaud it back via her.  I
'm hoping to arrange a visit to Samoa this
 
coming spring.  Please let me know if you think that might be helpful and, if
 
so, just when I could be of maximum use.
 
Are you acquainted, by the way, with the Academy for Educational Development?
 
They have recently sat up a branch office at the University of Guam, but they
 
plan to try to do projects all over the American Pacific.  The directing officer
 
is William Kinder, who is working with Dr. Dirk Ballendorf, Director of the
 
Micronesian Area Research Center located at the University.  I think a note to
 
Dr. Kinder would be a good idea.  He might be of some assistance, and at the
 
least you should be in touch with each other.

Tear T
ar. Peck,
 
I am sorry to have been so long in writing.  It's been pretty busy here.  Let me
 
bring you up to date on where we stand.
 
First, I have listened to both the tapes you gave me -
-- the radio program and a
 
kind of practice tape of the Chamorita songs that you recorded.  I will be
 
copying the former and sanding it off to my brother for a kind of ethnomusicolo-
gical analysis that he does.  I think you and the Rotans will find the results
 
Interesting
,.
 
+
question.  If I could in future arrange to get a really fine quality recording
 
machine and professional recordist out to the Northern Marianas, could a
 
Chassorita session or several sessions be arranged so as to record more songs
 
in group performance?  On Rota, Tinian, Saipan, Guars, other islands?  I think
 
you have a r
:
:usical and poetic form here of real interest, but,it needs to be
 
professionally recorded in greater quantity than you've had time to do.  The group
 
performance was thrilling.  Just think about this and give me your reactions.
 
There isn't any hurry; we need to move deliberately with some good planning
, so
 
that we do this marvellous material full ,
justice.
 
Next, I read through all your poems and many of the newspaper stories and have
 
shown them to a colleague who works in the Literature Program.  His name is
 
Victor Perera, and he will be writing you himself in due course.  He gave me the
 
copy of the Literature guidelines that I enclose for your use.  T
ie advises me
 
the following:
 
a
.  that you consider applying as a poet for a fellowship from the
 
Literature Program in 1984, and/or that you consider applying; for a creative
 
writing fellowship from the Program in 1
935, when they will be accepting
 
applications from both poets and prosists (
to coin a term).  :
vote the deadlines
 
and requirements and act accordingly.  Mr. Parera can advise you if you have
 
specific questions.
 (Address his here -- as in the guidelines.)
 
b.  with or without a fellowship that you consider taking the work you
 
have already done, prose and poetry, and working it into a book manuscript.
 
Both Victor and I think that it could be done and that it could be an important
 
book.  It ought to contain all the elements that we find throughout your pieces
 
your autobiography (
stressing on the Pacific period of your life).  your
 
experiences with radiation testing results including your reactions to Guam as
 
- 2
 
a kind of carrier base for the Viet Naas war, your experiences with your various
 
Micronesian friends on various Kieronesian islands, and the Decline and Fall of
 
the Trust Territory.  You've been at a kind of key position in a whole cluster
 
of important events that nobody paid much attention to at the time.  You should
 
(as you've already done) sake your book more than just a history or an auto-
biography.  It should be the kind of humanistic history that everybody would
 
want to read.  I think it could be a perfectly smashing book.
 
If there is any way I could be of help, just holler.  Victor Perera feels the
 
same s
pay.  Perhaps you would like us to try to help you find an editor, perhaps
 
an went or a publisher, though it is a bit early on for that.  Anyway, ve will
 
not do anything until you decide what it is you would l
ime to happen.  I warn
 
you, making a book is a terrible labor.  I only did one and I redid it completely
 
three tines.  I thought I would never see the end of it.
 
I hope all is well on Rota.  When Rita Enos vets back to the island, give her my
 
warm regards, and tell her I hope her computer is now able to write in perfect
 
Chamorro.  I met many other lovely people on Rota when I visited these three
 
years ago, but I can no longer remember their names.  How disappointing.  I never
 
spent such a pleasant day nor visited more lovely people.  I hope they are all
 
well.

Some time ago Bess asked me to see if I could assist in providing
 
some funding for Dan Sheehy to travel  to Caracas.
 Dan has
 
received a recent  invitation to participate in the first
 
Inter-American Congress of Ethnomusicology and Folklore.
 The
 
OAS would cover his actual expenses once in Caracas but travel
 
funds are not provided.
 
I have checked with USIA to see whether  they could cover his
 
travel but in this instance that was not feasible.
 
The total cost of this effort would be $570,  which is not in
 
the Folk Arts travel budget.
 Bess could afford $200 of these
 
dollars out of her budget,  in addition to the funds that she
 
is using to get him to Tallahassee for another conference,
 
which in effect is reducing the total cost for  the travel.
 
This is to request $370  from the Chairman's  
AeservP to  assist 
.
Dan h
in
 
is travel- 
I think he would bring credit to the agency
 
as a whole and it would be a great broadening experience for
 
him.

Dear George and Martha,
 
Sorry to have taken so long to write you, but I have been digesting s
ay trip,
 
thinning what I could have done better, reviewing all the complexities I ran
 
into on the four islands I visited in the ten days I was in the Pacific,
 
generally trying to !
sake sense out of the trip.
 
I wish I had had some idea beforehand of the problems that were at issue during
 
our meeting.  I still am not sure of what they all were, but as my visit to
 
Saipan went on, it became ever more apparent that there were conflicts that
 
might well have been discussed during our session.  Some of theca can perhaps be
 
aired and ameliorated by correspondence.  I am willing to try.
 
Let me first respond to your specific questions (
as I remember thew at least).
 
1
)  Do all NEA grant applications have to go through the Commonwealth
 
for arts and Cultures (
Saipan)?
 
This depends on the Arts Endowment program you are applying
, to.  Each
 
has its own ground rules.  The Folk Arts Program has no restrictions (except
 
for our experimental state-based apprenticeship program, cf. page 12 in the
 
enclosed brochure).  However, the Artists in Education Program limits its
 
applications for artists residencies to state arts agencies (and the equivalent
 
territorial bodies).  Other programs within the Endowment limit eligibility in
 
other ways -
-- by total annual budget, or length of season, or many other limiting
 
factors.
 
I should have said this at the meeting.  I answered as I did simply because
 
at the time I was thinking only about Folk Arta applications.
 
2
)  Is there assumed within the granting structure a basic salary level for
 
artists, including folk artists?
 
I
've checked with AIR and other programs and have concluded, no, there isn't.
 
We are dealing with a chiarascuro of local laws, union regulations, customs,
 
history.  Generally, the Endowment has stayed out of the salary issue, trying
 
always to tactfully elevate the minimum without inflating the maximum, trying
 
mostly to keep out of trouble because trouble begins with the dollar sign.  Consider
 
the complexities of union salary scales, for example.  In folk arts, we are dealing
 
2
 
with non-union members, most of the time.  Well, I won't go into the issues more
 
explicitly; we've managed to make some gains by virtue of not making the issues
 
as explicit as we could have.  One of those strange situations, where I genuinely
 
believe that local negotiation is infinitely more effective than any outside fiat.
 
3
)  Can US grant money be used to make purchases from sources outside the
 
US?
 
I can't find anybody to say it can't be; generally grant monies are to be
 
expended by the grantee according to his/her best judgment -- it's a very loose
 
system.  It does seen to me that in smaller places where everybody knows what
 
everybody else is doing and has an opinion about it that some degree of discretion
 
might be advisable.  I
'm not talking about secrecy, just trying to work things
 
out so that more people are happier.
 
I
'm enclosing a copy of the Folk Arts guidelines and a copy of the Artists
 
in Education ,
guidelines for your use, also a Guide to the Endowment.  I hope
 
they are some use, and I hope my visit was too, if only to open up a few issues
 
for conversation.  It was a real pleasure to meet you both, and I hope things
 
work wall for you.  Please let me know if I can be of any possible help.

I write to express once again my deep appreciation for the cordial hospitality
 
you and Mrs. Bordallo extended to me during my visit to Guam last month.  I
 
was greatly honored to be included in the luncheon party at Government House
 
in honor of the master weavers at the Arts Council's basketry conference.
 
And the certificate which you signed declaring me a member of the Ancient Order
 
of the Chamorri is one of my most treasured possessions.
 
I also remember with great pleasure the meeting in your office during which you
 
outlined your concept of the Latti Stone of Freedom.  I have discussed the
 
intrinsic meaning and significance of the Latti Stone structure with several
 
members of the Arts Endowment's Design Program and also with the Deputy Chairman
 
for Programs, Mr. Hugh Southern, who is my immediate superior.  When you next
 
come to Washington, I would hope to be able to arrange a meeting for you with
 
the Chairman, Mr. Frank Hodsoll, or Mr. Southern as well as others on the staff
 
who might be of some assistance.
 
As I told you at our meeting, the Endowment is precluded by its enabling legislation
 
from providing "brick and mortar" money, but there may well be other ways through
 
which we could be of assistance.  Planning is one.  The cultural facilities
 
(
auditoria, exhibit spaces, media production facilities, libraries and so on) that
 
would both comprise and cluster around the Latti Stone must be, it seems to me,
 
most carefully planned so as to provide not only the lasting spiritual symbolism
 
that you express with such eloquence but also the flexible, state-of-the-art,
 
forward-looking presentation capabilities that the artists and the citizens of
 
Guam deserve.  I believe there is a preliminary study that outlines at least some
 
design suggestions.  I cannot think of a more exciting and life-enhancing project,
 
and I would hope that the National Endowment for the Arts and the Government of
 
Guam could engage in a joint exploration of the many possibilities that could be
 
projected.
 
I do hope that you will let me know when you next may be coming to Washington,
 
I shall, I believe, be seeing Annie Stone next October in New Orleans, Louisiana,
 
at the meeting of the National Association of State Arts Agencies.  I shall
 
look forward to hearing from her how your great dream is progressing.

Tear Sandra,
 
I
'm terribly sorry it's taken me so long to write.  A lot of work had piled up
 
while I was away, I haven't been feeling too well, I had a trip or two to make --
lots of reasons , all pretty large excuses.  I think often about our pleasant visit,
 
and wish I could come back soon and do it all a bit better.
 
I
'm afraid I didn't manage t
he meeting with the education folks too well --
Mr. Tubuteb and some of the others rather caught me off guard . I
've written
 
hire, also the 1
3abermans, and hope to have clarified some of the difficulties
 
that arose , I shall also be seeing;
 Ana Teregeyo in New Orleans in a few weeks
 
and perhaps we can work out a few ways to improve any bag: feelins�s that may have
 
resulted from c
ry denseness.  In the meantime, I
'm sending you, under separate
 
cover, copies of Making Home Video and t
he Tape Recorded Interview.  I hope you
 
will find theta useful.
 
Please let me know how matters develop.  I an always anxious to help i
f I can.
 
It was really so nice to get to know you; Corey and I enjoyed our visits with
 
you enormously.  With all best wishes and thanks for your hospitality,

Dear Professor McPhetres,
 
I write belatedly to thank you for the magnificent volume on Micronesian history
 
you presented s
ae.  I have found it most informative and I shall put it to good
 
use lending it to s
ay less fortunate friends.
 
It was a genuine pleasure to meet you, and I wish you all good fortune in
 
the development of the Northern Marianas College, an extremely important
 
undertaking.  I hope that, if there is ever any way in which I could b
e of
 
service, you will let me know.  It must be an exciting; venture to start a
 
brand new colleget
 
I am sorry that I didn't get to spend any time with your husband, Samuel, and
 
see how he is handling the extraordinary responsibility of organizing the
 
Trust
  Territory archives.  What a treasure trove for future historians those
 
files must be.  Please give him my warm greetings and best wishes for the
 
success of his work.
 
I hope some day we will meet again.  In the meantime, my very best wishes and
 
thanks again for the beautiful book,

Dear Mr. Tebuteb,
 
I am sorry to have been so long in writing you.  It was such an interesting
 
meeting we had that morning last month -- you and Balbina Kintaro and the
 
traditional Saipanese dancer whose name I hope I have right -- Marguerita
 
Serapo.
 
It is too bad that the earlier basketry project had not been completed and
 
that Elissa Salmi-Saslo was off-island.  It would have been helpful, I think,
 
if we could have looked at the results of that earlier grant.  Mr. Tebuteb, that
 
w
as an unusual grant for us.  The Arts Endowment hardly ever supports the costs
 
of making books; that is'an area that we leave strictly to the National Endowment
 
for the Humanities.  We consider our job to try to support artists and get money
 
to them to create art.  That is why we broke our usual rule and funded the
 
basketry book; we hoped that Elissa Salmi $aslo could explain and document for
 
young Saipanese artists exactly how Balbina Kintaro did her basketry.  This,
 
we hoped, would provide funds for two working artists while helping an oncoming
 
generation learn.
 
It seemed to me the idea to do a book about Saipanese dance was a quite different
 
project.  It couldn't probably be a how-to-do-it manual, and a general
 
descriptive book about dance would be quite outside our possible funding area.
 
I would have to refer it straight away to Humanities, and they would require all
 
kinds of scholarly editing.
 
Finally, I want to try and clarify the issue of who can apply to the Endowment.
 
The National Endowment for the Arts is made up of twelve programs (Music,
 
Literature, Theater, Folk Arts, Visual Arts, Museums, etc. etc.) each of which
 
have their own particular rules and regulations, appropriate to the circumstances
 
that pertain in their particular  fields.  The Folk Arts Program is open.to
 
applications from any non-profit organization (
cf. our guidelines, a copy of
 
which I enclose) with the few exceptions you will notice.
 
k

However, other Endowment programs have other rules, and I understand that the
 
Artists in Education program is and has been for some years open only to
 
applications from State Arts Agencies.  I am sorry I did not know this when
 
a
re P
iet.
 Please address any further querias you have to me, and, whether or
 
not t
hey concern Polk Arts, I will make every effort to see that they are
 
answered.

yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Warvestad:
 
Thank you f
or your letter of September 5 to our Falk Arts Program.  I am
 
sending you a copy of our program brochure that gives a fairly detailed
 
description of our program's grant offerings.
 
One simple suggestion for your needs is our Apprenticeship category.  Under
 
this category, an intermediate or better learner way apply for money to study
 
with a caster traditional artist.  The money is intended to go in great part
 
to the Buster artist as a remuneration for his/her efforts.  We do not pay for
 
international travel nor do we subsidize the learner, except in small amounts
 
for local travel and materials such as cassette tapes to record lessons.
 
However, i
f someone good wants to study with a muster here or in '
Norway, they
 
way apply to us for a grant.
 
Are there not master hardanger fiddle players somewhere in the United States,
 
Washington State, for example?  In the past, we have sponsored bringing a
 
naatwr artist in from another part of the country to give workshops.  We have
 
not supported the bringin- artists in from abroad (
since we are a domestic
 
agency), with almost no exceptions.  The only exception that comes to mind
 
from over the past five years is when we supported artist fees for a Basque
 
tzistu (
flute) player during his stay in the U
.S.  The Basque community paid
 
for his travel, and i
t was clear that there were no other good txistu players
 
available here.
 
Consider my suggestions, read the detailed brochure, and if you have any
 
further questions, do not hesitate to get in touch with me by telephone.  If
 
you call me person-to-person collect at 202/682-5449 and leave your n
ame and

I am sorry to say that I cannot recomm
tend the Palani Vaughn troupe to tour
 
Africa.  With the exception of a few brief demonstrations of traditional
 
hula, than great bulk of his presentation is well in the realm of contemporary
 
popular music, rather than traditional material.
 
However, if you are truly on the lookout for a good Hawaiian ensemble, a
 
group called Ka Pa Hula Hawaii comes highly recommended.  I understand from
 
Elizabeth Tatar of the B
.P. Bishop Ymseum in Honolulu that the director,
 
John Raha`i Topolinsky is excellent, they really put on a good show, and it
 
is the real thing all the way.  They may be able to reduce their group to
 
ten or even eight people to tour.  The director's phone is 808/488-5862, and
 
his horse address is 98-12
"9 Puaalii St., Aiea, Hawaii  96701.  If you want
 
to call him, he is a school teacher and does not get home until after 2

Dear Arawaua Hayashi.
 
Thank you for your letter of September 30 to Chairman Hodsoll and the copy
 
to me.
 
First of all, as to the changing of the dates of your study with Suenobu
 
Tagi l,
 this should be an easy matter to arranger.  once you decide on the
 
best tine for you. simply drop us a letter requesting that your ,
grant period
 
be extended to the outside date of your study.  I do not anticipate any
 
problems in changing the grant period.  Also, if you want to study in two
 
sessions rather than one, I feel this would still be well within the
 
original intent to the grant.  The most important thing to us i
s that your
 
apprenticeship be s successful one.  I suggest that you send it directly to
 
me in the Folk Arts Program, National Endowment for the Arts, 1100 Pennsylvania
 
Avenue, N
J
.W., Washington, DC  20506.
 
As to your second inquiry, I do not have an easy solution.  All I can suggest
 
is that you contact people in Los Angeles to see if they may know of available
 
places to stay or short term work you might do.  At UCI,A, there are Suenobu
 
and the: professor of dance, Juditb 5usilo.  Also, the people at the Japanese-
American Cultural and Community Center, headedeup by :
f
ir. Gerry Yoshitomi,
 
s
way be of some help.  I am afraid I am short on suggestions for you here.
 
At any rate, I wish you the best with your apprenticeship, and if you have
 
any further questions, do not hesitate to get in touch by telephone.  If
 
you call me person-to--person collect at 202/682-5449 and leave your name and

Dear Don,
 
I
'm afraid that m
y response on the Fellows awards will be not only late but
 
troublesome . Please remember that I've never done this before and have been
 
out of the teaching business for nearly seven years.  I f
ear my views may have
 
gotten skewed.  But here gods anyway.
 
Generally , 1 was disappointed.  The overall level was not what I had assumed
 
(
hoped) it would be; certainly there Was no single essay with "winner"
 
written all over it.  This leaves me floundering.  If we can take multiple
 
entries together , I guess I
'd have to plump for Anne Burson whose two workmanlike
 
essays indicate a professional breadth and maturity that could well be recognized
 
by the Society.  But I didn't think either one was that outstanding.
 
I suppose, i
f you held m7 feet to the fire, I
'd order them as follows:
 
1
)  Bhojali,
 - Joyce Flueckiger . Somewhat dispiritedly written, but a
 
responsible pie
rce of scholarship including what are to me the essentials:
 
field work ,
 comparative research , analytical development and conclusions.
 
1 respect her careful attention to both Levi-Strauss and Tropp; I just wish
 
she hadn't gotten so tied up in the specialized Asian scene.  What she had
 
to say could have had an enlarged audience if she had just visualized i
t that
 
Way.
 
2
)  Swan Maidens and Smiths - Anne Burson . This isn't my area, but on the
 
assumption she had consulted the appropriate sources , she's done a scholarly
 
,
job.  Again she writes in a pretty cramped style and I don't know how important
 
the problem is, but she did comae up with a conculsion and that helps.
 
3
)  krappe - Anne Burden.  A nice stray piece of work, better written than
 
the other.
 
;
) Makin& Might hideous - Susan B
. Davis . Plainly the most graceful and
 
accessible essay and I would give it top marks in a course in American Studies
 
but be derasd if I can find the folklore in it really . This gets me back to
 
_ 2 -
 
Professor Don Ward - Fellowe Awards
 
the point of the exeerrciset, I
'm taking this prize as identifying future
 
contributors to the discipline, sad I just don't see that in this particular
 
piece, though it does have charm, an elem "t lacki n in the others.
 
5
)  West African Riddles - Gray-Saul.  Inoxp
 erienced and incomplete.
 
6
)  Slav Devil - Corx% vwska.  Difficult to read and when you're through,
 
not too much has h
eappe utd.
 
I do hope somebody also on the committee has firmer feelings than I do.  I
 
wouldn't mine, if aitbor Flueckigesr or Burden Sot it, nor would I feel upset
 
if we didn't five a prise at all.  Anyway, I hope my reactions are of some
 
use.  I will probably telephone and discuss them with you directly since this
 
letter will be a bit late.

Dear Dirk,
 
I
'm really sorry we had such a fleeting visit when I was in Guam.  I had
 
thought you would be calling the following day, but than I got busy too.
 
Anyway,it was good to see you if only for a moment.
 
I did meet with Dr. Marvin Hontvel-Cohen about lis new project at the University,
 
and only today caught up with Dr. William Kinder, only three days before he
 
leaves Washington for Guam himself!  We had a brief but I hope useful discussion,
 
and I do hope that something can be worked out in connection with your notion
 
for apprenticeships in storyboard carving on Palau.
 
I have written Annie Stone, the new arts council executive director, and urged
 
her to familiarize herself with the work that is going on at the University,
 
especially at MARC.  Prior to our brief call, I
'm not sure she had any notion
 
of how much work you folks are doing -- do you suppose this is a c
lassic town
 
and gown situation?  Anyway, I think she is a thoughtful and concerned and
 
responsible woman, and I hope all goes well.
 
The next time I come I am simply going to say that I want a full day to poke
 
around the University, and maybe we can work in more than our biennial hullo--

'd suggest you get in touch

speak to me or to my associate Bob Ttske, one of us will return your call on
 
t
he federal line at no cost to you.
 
I
'm sorry I can't refer you to any articles or publications concerning Folk
 
Artists in Schools.  There are various such programs around the country, but
 
they differ widely and no overall printed description is available.  Actually
 
a number of these programs will be discussed at one of the Sunday morning
 
sessions at the upcoming meeting of the American Folkl
.ore Society (
October
 
26--33 in Nashville.  See the AFS newsleter for program details))  I hope that
 
one of the outcomes of this discussion will be a decision to produce some
 
kind of written material for people like yourself.  If you by any chance could
 
attend the meeting, you could get a chance t
o speak directly with a number of
 
the state folk arts coordinators who are conducting t

It was a pleasure to meet you on t

applied to the Guam Arts and Humanities Council for some fiscal assistance for

Please keep us in mind if you feel that some part of your activities could be

anyway.
 
I also hope you will continue working with Annie Stone, who, I think, is a
 
fine person and one who could use some help in bridging the gap between
 
administrators and scholars.  She needs the solid information thattyou and
 
the people at MARC could provide, and I think she may be a bit shy in asking
 
for it.  I may have, of course, read the situation wrong; I was there such a

Dear Kelp,
 
I write, outdated though I a
ra sure this letter will be before it reaches you,
 
to thank you again for your many courtesies and for your sound counsel during
 
my recent visit to Guam.  I have been listening to the tapes I dictated each
 
evening, and your name comes up more often than any otherl  I really appreciate
 
your taking so much time and trouble to help Corey and a
ye get around, especially
 
since my visit must have been exquisitely ill-timed for you, what with the
 
beginning of the school year.  I shall try to be more considerate another visit.
 
I also hope that I was a bit of help to you in your complicated job of Chairman
 
of the Arts and Humanities Coun
c
i
l.  I
'm afraid that, as I so often do, I plunged
 
in too quickly and drove too hard, thus failing to recognize some things I
 
should have attended to.  Betasen you and me, Kelp, the main thing I wish I had
 
worked harder on during those slightly frantic three days was getting the uni-
versity and the arts people together.  I a
ye writing Annie today and urging her
 
to follow up and get better acquainted with M MC and with the other university
 
people.  They could be such a help to the entire development of the folk arts
 
program, but they need to be involved, not just have their names on paper.  I
 
think this is an area where you could be a terrific help -
-- kind of acting as
 
go-between.  Scholars have their own sensitivities as you know.
 
Well, I must stop giving people advice, it's a terrible habitl  I have taken
 
your videotape to Joe Psince who will get in touch with you directly, I
'm
 
sure, when he's had a chance to see it.  I hope to get another look at it myself
 
with him.  Thanks again for making the dub of the canoe builders for me; it will
 
come in vary handy.

the authority rightfully theirs.  She depends
_ on her native arts panel, which
 
is made up of native artists, and is terribly disturbed by the thought of not
 
being able to have its advice and counsel.  She would like to discuss the
 
situation with you and hopes that you will raise the issue in the strongest
 
terms with Bob Miller, acting director of the Alaska Arts Agency.
 
The Eskimo Dolls book edited by Suzi, is just a loan (my copy) but I am sure
 
Suzi could lay hands on another for you if you like it as much as I do.

) In re your Washington trip, attached is some of the information on the
 
Samish totem pole.
 (
This is old -- the design is quite different and some of
 
the historical information has been updates.)  dote the dedication is on
 
September 24; it ought to be a blast -- besides including a salmon feed.
 
My contact is Ken Hansen, Chairman, Samish Indian Tribe, Anacortes Washington
 
206/293-6404, a lovely fellow.

Dear Walter,
 
It was so pleasant to see you in Washington at the recent Inter-American
 
conference on crafts at the organization of American States.  My colleagues,
 
Daniel Sheehy and Robert Teske, who attended most of the conference told
 
me that your participation was of the highest order and most helpful.
 
I also wanted to tell you how much I admired the small but most elegant
 
exhibit of Puerto Rican crafts that you set up at the meeting.  As always,
 
with your encyclopedic knowledge of crafts and artisans in Puerto Rico, you
 
presented an exciting and yet well balanced display.  I enjoyed it very much
 
as did many others, I know.
 
Finally, I have a small favor to ask.  Could you possibly send Jaime Gonzalez
 
Oliver my earnest thanks for his gift of a santos carving by the fine craftsman,
 
Domingo Orta, from Ponce?  I have it on a shelf in my office where many people
 
see and admire it.  It was kind of Sr. Gonzalez-Oliver to think of waking a
 
presentation to the Folk Arts Program, and the selection of the three kings
 
carving was most appropriate.  I am only sorry that I do not have his address
 
to express my appreciation directly, but I know you will be my spokee mn.
 
With my warmest personal regards, as always, Walter, I remain,
 
Yours sincerely,
 
beau Lomax Hawes
 
Director

Q-0I
 /
(
.
 
One of the top officials at USIA telephoned to ask if we could suggest
 
any printed or visual material concerning the various disciplines and
 
fields of the two Endowments which might be of interest to individuals
 
and institutions overseas.
 
He would be most interested in seeing anything we think suitable for
 
reprinting or for distribution in other countries.  This can be
 
material either prepared directly by our agencies or by those with
 
whom we deal.
 
If there is anything being planned, he would also like to know so that
 
additional copies can be ordered for the use of USIA overseas.
 
Please let Edythe Jacobs (NEA :
 682-5439) or Margaret Battle (NEH :
 786-o446)
 
know if you have any suggestions or material.

Dear Mr, Chung,
 
In reference to your letter of August 8
, 1983 i
n re the Yeti—Yu atiDe
ese Opera
 
Association, I believe you addressed yourself to the wrong program.  Your
 
quotation concerning "Professional opera musical tyester" comes from the
 
guidelines
; of Vie Opera 1
1usical T
heater Program, not the Folk Arts Program.
 
I shall enclose a copy of our current guidelines for your information.  According
 
to our records, the last Folk Arts grant to Yeh Yu was in 1
991.
 
I have forwardee your communication to the Opera Music Theater Program and I
 
as sure you will be hearing from them directly.

I am writing to request funding assistance in order to convene
 
our Traditional Native Arts Advisory Panel during this fiscal
 
year.
 Based on advice from a recent discussion with Bob Teske,
 
I am requesting travel expenses for a September 1983 meeting

 grant

and per them for two from Fairbanks,  and one each from Bethel,
 
Juneau and Kotzebue.
 Two panelists live in Anchorage.
 
In prior years,  costs of panel meetings have been in our annual
 
budget appropriation from the state legislature.
 This year,
 
though our overall budget is still healthy,  particular items
 
were removed from the budget by the legislature for various
 
political reasons.
 Among budget items cut was non-employee
 
travel,  thus eliminating the funds for convening advisory panels.
 
• lost 40%  of • 
The Traditional Native
 
Arts
 
Panel is the oldest,  most active ASCA panel,  and its role,  unlike
 
that of our other discipline panels,  extends to policy and
 
programmatic concerns in addition to grant review.
 We do have
 
the option of modifying the panel system to a "reader"  system
 
or  "convening" via teleconference,  and we plan to use telecon-
ference for our winter panel meeting.
 However,  the benefits of
 
actually having the panel meet together,  though intangible and
 
not quantifiable,  are invaluable.
 Especially in Alaska, with
 
the geographical distances and with the significant cultural
 
distances among the Native groups  (
Eskimo, Aleut,  Tlingit-Haidi-
Tsimpshian, Athabascan),  the educational process that occurs
 
during panel meetings is extremely important for all involved.
 
The panel's varied expertise and their contacts with local Native
 
communities,  joined with their commitment to the Traditional
 
Native Arts Program,

As you may know,  since March we have had a new Council,  and
 
though it was then too late in the year to repair some of the
 
legislative amputation on our budget,  the members of the present
 
Council recognize the advantages of a panel system and have
 
expressed support of it.
 Thus,  I am optimistic that we may be
 
able to restore travel funds for panels in FY85 after this one-
year hiatus.
 
I appreciate any consideration you can give these requests,
 
and I would be glad to provide any additional information.

Dear Ana:
 
I have finally gotten my travel plans ri med up,  and I'n happy to
 
tell you that I will reach Saipan at 4:34 p.m., Sunday,  August zv
 
on Continental #563 and will be staying until Thursday nornin? at
 
SsG5 a.m. when I
'll be hopping; over to Guam for a few days visit
 
with Annie Benevente Stone.
 P
ly daughter, Corey Genos, has been
 
able to arrange her work schedule so as to core with me again,
 
and she is looking forward to the visit as much as I an.
 
Since Kim Bailey is no longer on the island,  I wonder if it night
 
be possible :
'or someone else on your staff to help r
ye work out a
 
schedule?
 I would like to be of whatever use I can be to you and
 
to the Arts Council,  and I hope that you will just tell me what
 
things you would g
rant me to undertake,  from planning sessions to
 
official visits or anything; else that would be Of use.
 If
 
Rokucho Billy and the A
gsarupow group are on the island, I would
 
enjoy so much visiting •
Kith then ag
-ain.
 And I should like also
 
to rake an appointment with Henry Sablan who has worked with an
 
old friend of mine in California, Dr.  Steven Arvixu; Steve also
 
suggests that it might by a good idea for me to meet with tit
 
Porter,  President of the College of Northern Micronesia.
 I shall
 
write both these gentlemen and augZest that they could call you
 
to say when they might be available.
 I hope this isn't an impo-
sition.
 
mostly, of course,  I should like to have some talks with ,
you
 
about the Endowment and C-PAC and how your own plans are pro-
gressing.
 As of the moment,  I have been unable to get a
 
reservation at the 3yatt-Regency Hotel where we stayed before but
 
I shall keep trying from here.
 Perhaps you could leave a message
 
with the desk there giving me some notion when and where you
 
will be Monday morning;; or,  if this letter arrives in tire,  per-
haps you could phone or cable s
ae.
 I shall try to get a telex o;f
 
to you in the morning as well, so so mehow or other, we shall get
 
in touch.

I am looking forward so r
such to visiting you and your beautiful
 
island again.

P.S.  A Mr.  Thomas Iebuteb from the Department of Education
s has
 
written ne about an  idea he has for a possible Folk Arts project,
 
so perhaps I might be able to speak with him at some point.
 Also,
 
I should see how Eliisa is coming; along :
with her basketry project
 
►or the Department of Education,  so perhaps  I should plan to
 
spend a day,  or at least a half a day there.

 August  9,  1983
 
Some  five years ago,  Dan Sheehy  represented  the Endowment at an
 
international conference on  the culture and cultures of the
 
Americans  t
'
c]at  took place  in  Ecuador and was sponsored by  the
 
Organization of American States.
 His  participation  in  that con-
ference caused much  favorable comment and  resulted  in his  being
 
consulted with ever greater frequency  by  the OAS and by Hispanic
 
embassies and Congressional  offices.
 This continues  to bear
 
fruit -- for example,  as  I mentioned  to you,  both Dan and Bob
 
Teske will be  invited participants  in an  inter-American crafts
 
conference  to be  held during the week of September 12  in
 
Washington,  again sponsored by  the OAS.
 
Now comes  this  invitation  to the Caracas Conference,  a follow-up
 
to the one Dan attended  five years ago.
 (See attached  letter
 
and memorandum from Dan  to me.)
 I can  testify  that the very
 
most  important  Latin American scholars and  folklorists will  be
 
in attendance,  and  that an effective U.S.  representation would  be
 
very well  received  in diplomatic and cultural  terms.
 I feel
 
very strongly  that Dan should go.
 It would be good for him,  for
 
the Folk Arts  Program and  for the Endowment.
 Only his  travel
 
costs are being asked of us -- this  is quite a compliment  in
 
itself and means  they  really want him.
 
What are  the chances  for approval,  in  the  first place,  and some
 
fiscal  assistance,  in  the second place?
 Let's discuss,  or could
 
you possibly  pass  this by the Chairman  for his reaction?

Dcnr Sandy:
 
Since I've only just received your magnificent letter addressing
 
the is sues surrounding the proposed Maine state folklorist posi-
tion,  I feel a bit embarrassed to try to respond in this semi-
public t
ray.
 Your response to Denny's idea is so characteristic
 
that I've decided to conment on it in this,  my own testimonial
 
letter.
 Really,  my dear old friend,  that letter of yours just
 
takes the calve for clear-headedness,  perspective,  proportion,  and
 
what I can only call down-rightners.
 I shall treasure it always
 
and intend to use it as a model of conduct for r
ay own frequent
 
facinL-up-to-the-fact times.
 
As I've often told you, you're really sadly missed in big tired
 
sad bad old Wa h ington.
 For one thing, you made our meetings so
 
much fun.
 Besides,  as a panelist you served to keep us steady
 
on the nark and you wouldn't let us fool ourselves.
 I can't
 
tell you how often. I've remembered your passoniate defense of the
 
great occasion that just happened one time and very probably
 
should never happen again.
 Again,  it's that sense of perspective
 
that most of us lose so easily when dealing daily with the day-to-
day.
 
Anyway,  please know that your twenty-fifth year at the helm of
 
the Society will be celebrated in more hearts than those of the
 
local members of the Northeast Folklore Society and in more
 
places than Orono and Augusta.
 Down here in Wa3 hington,  the
 
whole Folk Arts Program -- Dan, Bob,  Pat, Rose,  and I -- all
 
send you love and greetings and want you to kn ot that W  re
 
looking forward to the fiftieths

Thank you for the extra information about the San

archaeological investigation goes smoothly and that the bole gets properly dug.
 
I
.et at make a suggestion that didn't occur to me when we were talking in my
 
office.  There is a fellow she works for the Pndoc ment as  a Regional Representative
 
named Terry Melton who lives in and works out of Seattle.  TUM address i
s 501

ris phone i
s (
205)322-7465.  He is a good man
 
and a very experienced fund raiser and administrator.  I spoke to hire last wee'?
 
vl
,ien he was in A.C. shout your project, and '
he was very interested.
 If I were
 
you, 1 believe► I would invite hin to your dedication or something.  T
ie's sometimes
 
a bit hard to reach, because his territory is large, and ha ts on the road a lot,
 
but keep trying -- he is a *=art fellow and a good person and I c
oo believe he
 
could be of real help.
 
inst a suggestion.  Again, I hope a
ll goes well.

Dear ^uss,
 
The situation concerning funds for ethnographic f
ilm remains dire.  So dire, in
 
fact, that when a nice lady was I
n here from the Ford Foundation recently saying
 
teat the FT jitht be thinking about addressing some of the problems o
f cultural
 
preservation i
n their stateside funding that they have been working on in Meir
 
Third World programs, I launched i
nto an im assiones i
lea for ethnographic film
 
makers,  It might he helpful if you follaw*d this up with a letter to the Ford
 
Foundation asking i
f they have any current program to :VI V you might apply -
-
and it certainly couldn't hurt.  The lady's name was Linn Cary, Ford Foundation,
 
320 7ast 43rd, New York, NY 10017, 2

,2/573-5312.
 
I simply don't know any other thing to suggest.  however, my view i
s reasonably
 
myopic, in that i
t takes all I can do to keep track of the Folk Arts hudget,
 
much lose see what other people are spending; so do not ;
despair and keep on
 
W ing other people.  If I gear of anything, I s
tall certainly let you know.
 
I
'm taking off for a far—too--quict trip to Pava n, Guam and Saipan the end of the

'm hoping to s
top long enough in Ponape to at least say hello to Damien

To:  Hugh Southern
 
Deputy Chairman for Programs
 
From:  Bess Lomax Raves
 
Director , Folk.
 Arts Program
 
Subject:  Revised Application rormss
 
I have +
several general com ments on t
t:e proposed revisions:
 
1
)
 I associate myoolf with A.B.'s earlier comments on the inappropriateness
 
of using grant application forms to collect general informational data for our
 
own purposes . The Arts rndo,�
naent has long been disstinguisl;ed for its comparatively
 
simple and direct application procedures.  I continue to feel proud of the fact
 
t
isat through us any citizen can petition bis government without having to hire
 
an accountant or a professional grants writer in order to have any chance at all
 
of success.  I further wonder whether this i
s an appropriate t
ime to propose a
 
more complex series of ,
 aperwor"k hoops for applicants to jump t
t~rough.  I !
iad
 
understood that there was a general movement to simplify rather t
han to complicate
 
citizen--federal i
nteractions.
 
2
)  The application form, it seems to u
se, should he limited to information
 
that will help panelists make sensible 4ecisions concerning grants . This s
tay
 
vary from f
ield to field . For example , Folk Art s often asks applicants to
 
provide information as to just what part of a project federal funds are requ ested
 
for.  This is important information for our panel, but might be not at all relevant
 
to the considerations of another program.  These particular supplementary requests
 
will, I predict, inevitat-S
ly creep tack in program by programs no natter `
:
sow the
 
form i
s finally revised.
 
3
)  Folk Arts rattier likes the current form.  Tole i
s partly because
 
familiarity in this case breeds comfort, '
but i
t 's partly '
because i
t's not so
 
awful after all.  We have frequently suggested a few revisions on the fo g
s
 
itself; I eon't knw# w�esther you want any such simple an approach at this time.
 
4
) kvotAd i
t not he poaaitble to direct the energies of the form revisionists
 
towards the final reports?  The fiscal final report fork provides no information
 
whatever , and this i
s when you would really like to know just what t
'iey actually
 
wound up sprhding that money for, and how they really did get their match together,
 
all of which i
nformation a grantee should he perfectly willing to s
3sare.  And i
f
 
t
hhey weren't . I wouldn 't feel.
 at all t
>ad about leaning on them !
-:esvily . Tais i
s
 
— 2 —
 
when our statistical needs s
s
i
iebt be fulfilled at least in cart and I think Vie
 
figures we would end up vith would he far more accurate than t
hose taV
.en from
 
tie application form.

983 Moneys
 
It has been more than rumored that there are unexpended funds in the Chairman's
 
Reserve as well as additional unallocated program moneys.  I thought I would
 
therefore draw to your attention t
hat Folk Arta actually did run out of program
 
money this year.  The attached three recommended grants will appear in the
 
August Council pages for funding out of our 1984 budget:
 
If you could see your t
ray clear to funding one or another of these worthy projects
 
out of the Chairman's Reserve, it would save us some much—needed program money
 
in 1984.  Just a suggestion.

Dear Mo. Ayres,
 
I a
ss sorry to !
lave '
peer
, dilatory i
n responding to your letter 'b
ut it's been a
 
busy summer for me and your proposed project is so very complic ate'.  Since I
 
first looked i
t over, I have spoken both with Dudley Cocke of the Roadside
 
Theater as well as Hank Willett of the AlahAiaa Arts Council . Apparently, at
 
least most of the proposed theatrical groups have already been contacted, and
 
I therefore wonder if you mig`i
t not want to make them and their worn the
 
essential focus of the conference.
 
T
}te kind of theater these four organizations represent i
s an extremely recent
 
phenomenon, and I don't believe i
t i
s a very well understood one.  W
hy is
 
"Red Fox Second Ranging" such an extremely different theatrical creation than
 
"barn of the Moon" or "Creeen Crow the Lilacs" or "Oklahoma !
" for that matter?
 
Is it only the insider versus t
he outsider point of view?  Personally I believe
 
that is only a mm
 ll part of i
t.  W
liy do we all of a sudden have four t
heatrical
 
groups vi
.th such similar p
'iflosophies and ways of working springing up in such
 
different par t
s of tie country?
 
Then, what kind of impact does this new kind of theater have -- ghat do audiences
 
get from their performances , and which audiences -- ingroup or "cutgroup?"  How
 
much solid i
nformation I
s needed to hack up such theatrical presentations, many
 
of which focus an social pro�
:,lewx; and hoar should we approach the infinitely
 
complicated issues of stereotyping ? All four of these theaters deal both positively
 
and negatively with both positive and negative stereotypes in all their productions.
 
It seems to me that if you simply tackle the overall theatrical dimension and
 
how i
t differs from other kinds of oral communication* you have more than enough
 
for a fruitful conference.
 
You pro'N
ably don't especially want a

that you've '
bitten off too big a chunk , and I offer t

An for your request that I recosasseend music specialists , my feeal

will have to add aggreat number of musicians and musical performances to represent
_  
the musics fairly . Certain ethnomusicologists could discuss the traditions.

 I think you

I an enclosing several copies of the Folk Arts brochure and a

he essential
 
i
nformation that you'll run into again (

'd recommend t
hat you or Marc or w1hoeeer sits f
lown
 
around miff-August or so (if you're going to apply for the October 1 deadline) and
 
write me an informal letter covering the following points:
 
a
.  what you want to do"for example," put Dewey and s group of musicians
 
into the elementary schools i
n different parishes *
*it`s a day long program that wo
 
would cons ist of a general concert and visiting the music classes and explaining
 
the instruments and the musical style.etc. etc.  This i
s .
dust an example that I
  
made up out of s
ay head;you must figure out your own plan.
 
b
.  a tentative budget i
ncluding on estimate of how much money you will
 
need from the Endowment and t
rop* you plan to raise t
he matc'
'iing funds.
 
This information will allow Den Sheehy or me to got hack in touch With you and
 
help you with the application form; besides writing t
tse letter will help you
 
because doing i
t makes you get c
l
own to business and plan things out before you
 
tackle filling i

Just a juicy note to thank you for lending along a copy of the nice gars letter
 
you wrote Sister Mildred Barker on the occasion of her receiving the national
 
Heritage award . She came escorter4 b
y a small group of Shalker brethren and
 
turned out to be a total charmer with a voice like t
he sweetest of birds and a
 
aevastAting s
enile.  She was perfectly marvellous and I thinV
, -- I hope -- we
 
gave her a good time.  We certainly learne' a lot from her.

both the French section and the Heritage section i
n devastating heat and went

wire really did i

I also got your letter about t
2he possthility of a state folk arts program being

1hemever you are able to

near Fete,
 
Pareewith a newsletter that might lave escaped your notice.  I have an uncomfortable
 
feeling that I was to send you some other material but I can't remember just what
 
i
t was.  I do keep working at it '
gut t
he old brain just doesn't seem as retentive
 
as It once was.  I vieb I thought it was due to being overfilled with ideas...
 
I
'm also enclosing an object that has been identified with reasonable sureness
 
so "Pete's ties."  It turned up on the piano and 4aomi and John, more sharp—eyed
 
than I, identified it.  If they were wrongs for heaven's sakes, wear it in good
 
health anyway or turn it over to a deservirg tielese citizen,
 
Again, I
t uas meat to have you at the Heritage program.  I hope you were pleased
 
with it too.  I kept on worrying about how it ran an hour long and then remembered
 
how many FmCty and Tony shows I
've watched when they ran
_ hours over and those folks
 
are pros.  By the way, we're beginning to look for additional nominations.  There
 
are still some fines people already nominated that wo ove not gotten around to, but
 
there are plenty more than we know about I know.  Please keep reminding people to
 
send in nominations.
 
Monday after the ceremony I got s call as soon as I got i
nto the office from a
 
dear old lady from hoone, N.C. Oho anrounced that she played dulctmore and sang
 
old songs and that toy dicks had called her and told her to get in
, touch with me
 
because "they're looking for folks in that line up in Washington and it fs a good
 
thing and she ought to get in on it." So I guess he had a good time anyway.  I
 
wish you `
gad had a chance to hear him tell stories in his own time and milieu
 
out on the mall,  He didn't like to vork
. on the festival stage, he'd just sit
 
down urdeer a tree somewhere and the first thing you Inow there would be  a whole
 
crowO around him...
 
Dove always to you and Toshi.  Mope to see
: you soon and thanks again.  Your
 
affectionate emceeing roally helpee the show
* go so well.

Bear Nancy,
 
T an horrified to realize that I
've never written ever a lie* nor chatted with
 
YOU by phone since our trip to the rorth Carolina potteries when you were such
 
a cordial and helpful hostess and guide , I guess I just assumed you must realise
 
hat a marvellous time we all had and how educational and helpful a trip it was
 
lugh Southern still talks of i
t and you can't imagine how interesting it was
 
for hits to actually s
ere and experience a segment of the arts world where there
 
were artists who didn't have any idea the Endowment existed and weren't especially
 
overwhelmed when they found out that it did2
 
As for me, I have all my beautiful pots spread out still on my dining room table
 
vlere T admire them to my  hearts content.  Both my daughters have visited and
 
admirers them, and I will he passing along some orders, especially for cups like
 
the ones I got (smaller size, the kind of mug that sort of widens out at the bottom
 
and has three lines around i
t about half way up).  Seriously If ever you drive up
 
I would be delighted to buy a dozen or two of those cups i
n any and all colors.
 
I
've rarAly had anything i
n my '
louse that more people have asked me about.
 
Too were much missed at the Heritage ceremony, which went off, I think, pretty
 
well, though the whole performance was much quieter than last year's.  Lucinda
 
Te mer, Lanier Yeaders and Lem Ward did not come -- Lucinda because she i
s 981 0 
Lanier because of his mother's illness, and Lem hard because of his own difficult
 
battle against diabetes (poor man, he bas had one leg amputate?, and one fears
 
he will suffer Lee Hayes' fate) . Cheever did come to represent the family and
 
another black quilter d
emonstrated as *
cell an a '
4aryland bird carver, so the
 
traditions at least were available.  The exhibit in the 1
15
u s
eum was much better
 
@hats last year`s, and the program overall ran pretty smoothly.  We've rust
 
finished reviewing the whole event and Lave a number of changes to suggest for
 
next year, none of which will affect that panel ouch, I don't believe.  I do think
 
perhaps I might gently suggest that we maybe could avoi? nominating people in
 
their late nineties.  It's `
peen awfully awkward to keep the press off of Me. Toomer,
 
and neither she nor her family have such cotmprebension of what's ,
going on C
aere, as
 
far as I can W
e out.
 
Again, d
'ear Fancy, my heartfelt thanks for your hospitality and for devoting so
 
mach time to us that weekend.  It was ruck a golden visit somehow, very dear in
 
my recollection.  I hope you're feeling better and that you're not letting the
 
Smithsonian work you too hard.
 
Affectionately always,
