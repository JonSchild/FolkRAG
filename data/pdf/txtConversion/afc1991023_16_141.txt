Branch; 49GT. See also PFP83-CM0001-004, PFP83-RM0014-016, and 
PFP83-BJC216395-06 and 11. 
For photos of cedar logs once they 
are delivered to the sawmill see PFP83-CM0005-006. 
For 
documentation of cedar delivered to Joe Reid to build boats see 
Tom Carroll's logs 
OA-1: 
Steve turns logs around so butts (heavier ends) can be 
placed at cab end of truck. 
IA-2: 
Steve removes cable from logs just hoisted on truck. 
2A-3: 
Steve shoves same logs 
into place. 
3A-4: 
Steve pulls cable to wrap 
it around net group of 
logs. 
Cliff operates the winch controls from the other side of the 
truck. 
See below, #5A-6. 
4A-5: 
Steve adjusts cable at end of logs. 
5A-6: 
Cliff operating winch. 
6A-11: 
Cliff operating winch. 
To the side of the truck lie 
logs 
that will 
be hoisted onto the load later when truck is moved down 
the corduroy road. 
11A-14: 
As load gets higher, Steve must climb on top to adjust 
position of logs and remove hook and cable in order to pull cable 
to the next set of 
logs. 
Here he performs those operations. 
14A-16: 
Underexposed shots looking west from loading location 
down the road we drove in 
to get to the loading area. 
16A-17: 
Cable has been adjusted to center of 
logs once the 
logs 
are hoisted to 
lean on the truck bed. 
Here Steve looks for the 
best location for this set of 
logs. 
17A-19: 
Logs parallel and close to the truck can have cable put 
right in the center and can then be hoisted right up. 
19A- 
Logs with cable caught underneath them. 
20A-21: 
Steve guides logs into place. 
21A-22: 
Cable pulled a good distance away from truck (up to 150 
feet). 
Note dense brush. 
22A-24: 
Steve watches as Cliff winches in a number of 
large 
logs. Steve must gauge correct speed because Cliff cannot always 
see obstacles in the 
logs' path. 
24A-28: 
Loading of 
large 
log toward the top of the load. 
28A-34: 
Cliff hands 3-4 inch diameter logs to Steve to place at 
top of the load. 
These will be used for fenceposts.

This 
is a continuation of BM0215661-02 and 01. 
00: 
Cliff pushes log toward corduroy road. 
Logs are turned end 
over end to get them to the side of the road where they can be 
hoisted on to the truck easily. 
O1: 
Logs lined up along the side of the road for pick up on the 
next workday. 
Cliff and Steve throw branches on the road, the 
final 
layer of a corduroy road. 
02-16: 
Steve and Cliff cut trees. 
Cliff stands behind the tree 
while Steve notches it on one side and cuts through on the other. 
As the tree begins to fall Cliff helps by pushing it. 
Before 
cutting they check to make sure the wind is favorable. 
As you 
can see the trees are chosen so that they fall 
into an area 
already cleared and toward the road. 
17-20: 
Steve and Cliff begin to trim the branches off the trees 
once they are on the ground. 
21-22: 
A line of trees that have just been cut. 
I am standing 
at the road. 
23-26: 
Cliff picking up and throwing branches onto the road, 
after which he pauses briefly before continuing. 
27: 
(Description accidentally deleted; cannot find hard copy--SS) 
28: 
Steve walks from one place to another on 
logs. 
He did this 
often, and 
it 
is not easy. 
Again think of the amount of energy 
necessary to just walk around 
in a swamp covered with logs and 
brush, 
let alone work there with axe and chain saw blades. 
29: 
Steve trims a log. 
30: 
Steve walking on a log with measuring stick 
in one hand and 
an axe in the other. 
31-36A: 
Steve measures logs while Cliff cuts them into 16 foot 
lengths.
