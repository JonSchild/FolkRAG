The Lily of the West
THE LILY OF THE WEST 5106 B2
Grady Wiley Arvin, 1941
I started out to Texas Some pleasure for to find I met a fair young maiden Most pleasing to
my mind
Last night as I was walking Down by a shady grove I spied a noble chieftain Premending
with my love
Last night as I was waltzing With a dagger in my hand I caught him by the collar I made
him gently stand
I stabbed my desperado I stabbed him in the breast I stabbed my knife in Mary The Lily of
the West
Long came an officer And carried me on to jail Money wouldn't go in a murder case So
they locked me up in jail
Now for six long years in prison I'm bound a sure to go And if I die in prison I have but one
request Just write upon my tombstone The Lily of the West.
