"Dear Mr. President", Tucson, Arizona, January or February 1942
AFS 6450A
W. R. Vorris: Mr. President, as an ordinary businessman engaging in production for our local industry,
I'm interested, along with other businessmen, in the production for an all-out war. We're glad here in
Tucson that you have put such a man as Mr. Nelson in charge of wartime production. It will mean, in
the end, that the victory that we should have and that is a victory not only for war, but for the peace
which follows.
We, here in Tucson, are away off side, but in the midst of this war with every bit of energy that we
can get together. We want you to stand by the guns just as our men are doing in the front. This is W.
R. Vorris, printing executive of Tucson, Arizona. That enough? [said to interviewer]
