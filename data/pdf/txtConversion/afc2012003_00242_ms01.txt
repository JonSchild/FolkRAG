About Mary Rawls… 
 
Mary Frazier Rawls was born in San Francisco, California in 1927. For a time her father, 
using the stage name of Jack Williams, was known as “The Human Fly” and would climb 
tall buildings for pay. He would also paint store and restaurant windows to support the 
family. As the Depression hit, he began moving around more and continued to paint signs 
but also began the transition to performing various acts in different venues. At the age of six, 
Mary recalls her father teaching her the carrying perch act. He also taught her mother how to 
juggle, and her two younger brothers would do a boxing match to add to the family’s act. As 
they moved from town to town the family would perform on the streets to help support 
themselves.  
 
Mary was around the age of fifteen when the family joined their first show. Mary performed 
a high wire act for much of her circus career and transitioned to concessions after retiring 
from the wire. She married Harry Rawls, also in the show business, around 1947, and they 
worked for several circuses through the years including Cole and Walters, Carson and 
Barnes, King Brothers, and Kelly Miller.  
 
The Rawls and their eight children traveled the country with various circuses but made their 
home in Hugo, Oklahoma.

Today is June 30, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Juliana 
Nykolaiszyn. We’re in Hugo, Oklahoma, for a second afternoon with 
Mary Rawls. This is regarding the circus community of Hugo, 
Oklahoma. So thank you for having us again, today. 
 
Well, you’re more than welcome. Whatever I can remember, I’ll help.  
(Laughs) 
 
Well, when we were here before, you spoke about your father being a 
painter, painting windows. 
 
Yes. 
 
And then, at one point, you all decided to buy a house in Macks Creek? 
 
Yes, and we bought that house sight unseen. I think Dad was beginning 
to feel his age. He was trying to get a home for us that wasn’t on wheels 
before he passed. So he bought this house and all he bought it from was 
a picture. They had a picture of this house. Well, he put down fifty 
dollars on it. I think we paid six hundred and fifty dollars and it had, I 
think, five acres of land that went with it. When we got there to look at 
the house, it didn’t resemble that picture at all! There was no driveway, 
there were no windows, and the door was off of the hinge. (Laughs) So 
my dad pulled our vehicle over to the side of the road and we had a vote, 
because whenever there was a serious something to decide, we had to 
make a vote. Well, Momma didn’t want anything to do with it. She said, 
“I’m not going to live in there! I don’t want that!” Corky, my brother, 
Corky, the middle child, he was with Mom. Dad and I were the only 
ones that really wanted to stay there and do something with that place. 
Johnny hadn’t made up his mind yet, and we were all badgering Johnny 
to come on one side or the other. (Laughs) Finally, we got him on our

side.  
 
Then Dad and the boys got out with a shovel and they made a driveway, 
because it didn’t even have a driveway. It was a ditch like that (gesturing 
steep slope) and you had to have a driveway to get up in there. We drove 
up there with our truck and trailer, and we went inside the house and half 
the floor was gone. There was practically no floor. I swear it looked like 
pigs had been living in it—I mean real pigs! (Laughs) So my mom was 
just—it blew her mind away, but he had said, “Well, this is it. We better 
do the best we can with it.” Well, we had some furniture stored in 
Indianapolis, Indiana, where we had been living before in a house we 
rented. So Dad and Corky took off to go and get our furniture, and Mom 
and Johnny and I were left there. It’s out in the country, it’s all dark 
woods, and the nights are black as coal. We were working in the house, 
a little repair, a little hammer and nails, here and there. Then we would 
get ready to go up to our trailer, to go to bed. (Laughs) Some way or 
other my brother, Johnny, had a BB gun. So Momma’s carrying the 
lantern, I’m in the middle, and Johnny’s bringing up the rear with the 
BB gun, in case any of the bad guys or the spooks come out of the 
woods to get us! (Laughs) The nights in Missouri at that time of the 
year, are just as black as coal. You can’t see ten feet ahead of you so, 
that’s the way we did.  
 
Well, the next thing we had to do, of course, was build an outhouse. 
That outhouse, I swear, it wasn’t any wider than that (gestures about two 
feet)! (Laughs) It just looked like a telephone booth. We finally started 
hammering nails on that. If you’ve ever tried to drive a nail into a green 
oak board, you have really picked yourself a chore. We were all out 
there. Momma’s inside, trying to do things inside. All the rest of us were 
out there trying to nail up boards on this place, and Dad bought raw 
lumber. It wasn’t cured, and you really have to drive hard to get those 
nails into that thing. Then, you have to cover that with tar paper and then 
those tarry things that are supposed to look like bricks, I think you’ve 
seen them before, cover it with that. Well, we managed to do that.  
 
The house had, let’s see, there was a kitchen stove that was a wood 
burning stove. My mother hated that stove. She could not get a fire 
going in that stove! I never had any problem with it at all. She would 
always call me, “Mary, it’s time to start the stove.” I learned how to 
chop wood out there and bring the wood in, put it in the stove and get 
the fire going, and then we started cutting down trees. Have you ever cut 
down a tree with a two-man saw? Well, it is no fun! (Laughs) My 
brother’s on one side, I’m on the other, and we’re going like this 
(gestures going back and forth). I was a natural. By this time, I was 
dressing like a boy. We about had the house just about livable.

I was out there one time, chopping wood. I guess I was about fifteen or 
sixteen years old, maybe a little older, and this old man comes up out of 
the woods. He lived way down in the gully and he came up there, and he 
started talking to my dad. He saw me chopping wood and building it up 
for the fireplace. He said to my dad, “If you’d like to get shed of that 
girl, I’ll take her.” (Laughs) My dad laughed and said, “No, I don’t think 
I can let her go just yet.” He talked in the same kind of lingo that the 
man did. We got real acquainted with some people up on the hill, who 
ran a gas station. The big deal was to get to go up to Lilly’s place. We’d 
walk up there sometimes, and there was a man two houses down from 
us. He had a cow and he milked the cow and made his own butter. My 
father was regressing, because what time he had at a home, he was 
raised on a farm and his grandmother raised him. He says he’s going to 
get a churn so my mother can churn butter. Well, that didn’t go over 
very well with my mother because she’s out here with this thing 
(imitates churning motion) churning, churning, churning. We never did 
get any butter out of that thing! (Laughs)  
 
Finally, he said, “Well, we’re going to have to have a horse in order to 
bring these logs up from the backwoods,” where we were cutting down 
these trees and so forth. He went where they had a flea market kind of a 
sale that wasn’t quite the same as it is nowadays, but he bought an old 
nag, a blind-eyed, old horse. (Laughs) We’re trying to play farmer and 
not one of us knew anything about playing farmer. My mother was more 
and more disgusted all the time. We stayed there until spring, and then 
we got a date to go play fairs.  
 
We hit the road and went playing fairs. They used to have the big, circle 
race track and then they had the infield, and then there was this huge 
grandstand on the other side. Well, they had performers there and in 
between races they would have an act. At seven o’clock in the evening 
they’d have an entire program, but it was a pain in the neck, because a 
lot of these were sulky races. Have you ever seen a sulky race? Oh, boy!  
(Laughs) They are fun, but they are a pain because they’ve got these 
little horses all aligned with their sulky’s. There’s a big, tall house up on 
blocks, up here, and they’re watching it down and the horses all have to 
start at the same time. If one of them starts out ahead, “That’s a failure! 
That’s a failure! Bring them back! Bring them back!” and you’re waiting 
in your costume and wardrobe out in the boiling sun for them to go 
ahead and do their thing around there so you can get your act on and 
over with. (Laughs) That’s part of playing fairs.  
 
Well, we went out to Nebraska and Kansas with the fair dates. There 
were a lot of fairs out there. I’m doing a tight wire act with an umbrella 
and here comes that western wind and it blows your umbrella all the way 
off into the infield, and you’re out of luck with your umbrella. So I was

glad when the fair season was over. We spent a number of years on the 
fair season, and in between times of course, we showed in vaudeville, 
we showed in night clubs, and then circuses. We weren’t too much on a 
circus when we were small, but Dad got us a job with the Buck Owens 
Show and we went down there [Florida]—that’s where I met Harry. But 
before that, we were out in Kansas and we were with Bud Anderson’s 
All American Wild West. I think I showed you that picture of Big Chief 
Keys and his old battle axe. (Laughs) That’s where we met them, and I 
met this Chuck Fuller and his mother played the organ. His father was a 
clown and he was a clown and we dated a little bit, but it didn’t amount 
to anything. Every time they got too serious I said, “I’m sorry, I’m not 
into it just yet.” (Laughs)  
 
So from there, we came back here. We finally came back to Hugo. We 
pulled into the trailer park. We had gotten a job with Herb Walters, with 
his Cole and Walters Circus, and we stayed there for several years. But 
that’s after Harry and I met. We got married and we had a kid or two by 
that time. We spent, I guess, about three years with Herb Walters. That’s 
when we parked out here at the fairgrounds, and all the other show 
people parked out there, too. We had a sad thing out there. The tents 
were all canvas and when it rained they would leak, terrible. So they 
would take and coat them with paraffin before the season started. This 
man that was doing that—it wasn’t Herb’s show. It was another show. 
He was out there, and they heat the paraffin up over a camp fire until it’s 
pouring hot. Then, they sweep it onto the canvas with a broom. Well, 
this guy somehow managed to tip that paraffin over and it killed him. 
Nowadays, you don’t have to do that. You’ve got your plastic tents and 
you don’t have to do that.  
 
Another thing that happened on Herb’s show—he had a son-in-law. We 
had the tent spread and it was raining like a son of a gun and they [the 
tents] will belly out and hold the water in the tent. If you don’t get rid of 
that water, it’ll pull the stakes up and knock it down. (Laughs) So Harry 
goes in and he gets his gun. It’s a powerful weapon, evidently, and he 
pulls it up there and shoots! He put, you know, just like a little bullet 
hole in it. He blew the whole tent over and it came down, the big top!  
(Laughs) He never did live that down. (Laughs) I think I’ve got that 
cover, but I can’t get it into sequence, because I have these pictures like 
movies in my mind, but to put dates on them or times and so forth, it 
eludes me. It’s so long ago. Since I had my heart operation, I don’t 
remember as well. They just had me so sedated. It took me three months 
to get over the sedation. 
 
Did your parents keep the house at Macks Creek for very long? 
 
No, when Dad passed away—Momma never did like the place anyway.

We just held onto it for a long time and finally, somebody was willing to 
buy it. We put it up for sale and the real estate man that we traded there 
with the first place, well, he sold it. It was divided out in parts. My dad 
did some for Johnny and some for Corky and some for myself and so on, 
but we all just agreed to go ahead and sell it. 
 
Why had he picked there to begin with? Why there? 
 
The Lord only knows. I think he wanted to hide from the public, hide 
from the world, and everything else. He wanted to have his family right 
there and didn’t want to be bothered by anybody. (Laughs) He was the 
only one that felt that way. (Laughs) When I got pregnant with David, 
we went back there. We had just gotten back off of a fair route, and I 
started having labor pains. Harry was out with my dad painting signs. It 
hadn’t been a good season. We needed every dime we could get, and we 
were pretty well broke. So Momma took me to the hospital and David 
was born there. Of course, we couldn’t pay the bill. We didn’t have the 
money to pay the bill. You could have a baby for fifty bucks in those 
days, but we didn’t have fifty bucks. So Harry was raised in this school 
down here in Searcy, Arkansas, a boy’s school run by Catholic priests. 
So he wrote to one of them, and he got the fifty dollars to pay the bill at 
the hospital so I could come home.  
 
A bad thing happened to me in that hospital, because I had stitches. I had 
torn up pretty good at the birth. So they have a heat lamp that they were 
supposed to put on you to bake those stitches. Well, the nurse didn’t 
have access to the heat lamp so she took off my bed lamp that was 
hooked to the back of the table, and it got really, really hot and it fell on 
my stitches. So I was really kind of incapacitated for quite a little while, 
while that all mended. Well, Momma came and got me and brought me 
home. We were sitting there and all the boys wanted to see what the 
baby looks like and this, that, and the other. Just about the time I’m 
ready to unwrap the baby and show it off, we get a telephone call. The 
hospital has called us. We brought home the wrong baby. They gave us 
the wrong baby. Of course, I was breast feeding. I had already fed the 
baby, and it was a bottle baby! I thought, “Jiminy Christmas!” If I ever 
had a chance to sue anybody that was wide open! You didn’t think about 
suing people for something like that in those days. In fact, it takes a lot 
of money to sue somebody anyway.  
 
So the nurse from the hospital made a mad dash over with that baby and 
traded me for the baby I had. And, you know, they never told the mother 
what happened, the mother of the other baby—they never told her. I 
heard later, by the time that little boy was six or seven years old, she 
heard it somehow or another and she was suing the hospital. I never did 
find out how that went, but David was almost something else.

(Laughter) Her baby’s name was David, too. My David had reddish-
blonde hair, not very much of it, but some. The other baby had dark hair. 
So when they called me and they said, “You’ve got the wrong baby,” I 
started unwrapping the baby, because all I did was uncover its face so 
the boys could see what their nephew looked like and said, “This baby 
has got dark hair!” (Laughs) That’s after the phone call. So that was 
quite an experience. In fact, our telephone was on—there were eight 
people, what do you call it? 
 
A party line. 
 
Party line, right. And there were eight people on there, and because we 
were circus people and the phenomenon of the whole neighborhood, 
every time our phone rang, everybody on the line would click, click, 
click, click, click! (Laughs) They all knew about the change of the baby 
and so forth. We had two shows call up, two hires; one up in New York, 
the Jimmy Cole, and one down in Florida. We were answering the phone 
so when we went up to Lilly’s house, that’s at the gas station the person 
says, “Well, which one are you going to? Are you going to Florida or 
New York?” (Laughs) We were all just dumbfounded, because we didn’t 
realize that everybody was listening in. So that was our period there. We 
were going to be farmers—ha, ha, ha! (Laughs) 
 
Did they even have time to put in a garden? 
 
My dad went and bought a whole bunch of stuff. (Laughs) He was going 
to have strawberries up there. He was going to get this whole field 
cleared out, and he was going to plant strawberries. Well, that didn’t turn 
out very well because we got a date to go on the road. Well, who’s going 
to watch the strawberries? (Laughs) No, we didn’t get anything, but 
years later, Harry and I went through there to visit, because we were 
showing in another town just beyond Macks Creek. We stopped there 
and some guy had bought the property, he built a really nice house, he 
had a nice garden, he was planting trees and everything, and we just 
asked him if we could come up and look around. We told him we used 
to live there and so forth, and he was very friendly and nice. He had 
done a lot more with that property than what we were able to do.  
(Laughs)  
 
Once you had David, how soon did you go back to performing? What 
month was David born in? Was he a winter baby? 
 
Yes, he must’ve been, because we were off the road.  
 
If he was a winter baby, then you would be performing again by the time 
the show came out in the spring?

Oh, yes, yes. By the time I had three kids—I had David, Bobby, and 
Margie had just been born, and we got down to Florida. We had been 
telling Bobby, who was just a little guy then just barely able to talk, as 
we drove our truck into the end of our winter quarters, all about the 
elephants. Of course, we call them bulls. I said we were going to see the 
bulls. We drove up in there and Bobby’s all big-eyed, “Bulls! Bulls!” 
that’s about all he could say was “bulls!” (Laughs)  
 
Harry had gone in to see the boss and then he came back to the truck, 
very sober faced, very stern looking. I said, “Oh, boy, we didn’t get the 
job.” I said, “What’s the matter? We didn’t get the job?” He said, “Just 
be quiet. Just be quiet.” He drove us up to the city park and he parked 
there, and he told the kids to go out and play in the park. He told me that 
my dad had died. I didn’t have the money to go home, but he borrowed 
money for me to take the train and go home to my dad’s funeral. At that 
time, it snowed something terrible! You couldn’t get through to Macks 
Creek, to the area we lived in, and my brother Johnny came and drove 
me to the house. They weren’t going to let him through because the 
roads were blocked off with the ice and the snow and everything, and he 
told them, he said, “I’ve got to get through. My dad just died. We’ve got 
to go there for the funeral.” So they let us through. They took the road 
block down and let us go by.  
 
My brother, Corky, who at that time was still in uniform, he got a hold 
of the Catholic priest that was in there at Camdenton and said, “Now 
look, we have to bury my dad. I don’t want a long speech or anything 
like that. Just keep it brief.” So the poor priest was terrified, because 
Corky was a big, husky guy. So the poor priest, he did the best he could 
with the limited amount of what he could do and that was right at the 
gravesite. It wasn’t in the church. My father wasn’t Catholic but my 
mother was. So that’s how he got buried. There is such a wealth of 
memories and they all get mingled in your mind sometimes. 
 
You’re doing fine. 
 
Well, what’s the next question? 
 
While you were up on the wire performing, would you be thinking about 
anything in particular, or were you just focusing on keeping the next 
step on the wire? 
 
Oh, I wasn’t focusing on the step, but I was focusing on the audience. 
Here I am! Like me! Smile! (Laughter) I was a princess! I was on the 
tight wire! Everybody’s looking at me! That’s part of it. (Laughs) No, 
you’re not thinking about where you are stepping because that all

becomes just automatic habit. Like driving a car, you know exactly what 
to do because you drive all the time. You don’t think about it, you just 
do it. And that’s the way it was with that. 
 
Would you focus on anyone in particular in the crowd? 
 
I focused one time on the whole crowd because part of my act I have a 
beautiful, white evening gown with a flowing skirt and all that. I always 
made my entrance in that kind of an outfit. Well, we were playing a 
school, up in New York for Jimmy Cole. They announced me, and I step 
out there and I’ve got a tiara on and all these girls in the audience—most 
of them are high school students, “Ooohhh!” like that, and it froze me 
for a second. For a split second I was just frozen because, “Hey, they 
mean me!” (Laughs) Then I get up on the wire and I do the waltz in the 
gown and so forth. Then I would come back and the gown had special 
snaps so you could just yank it this way and it’d all fall off of you, and 
you were in your short costume that you could actually do your work in. 
But I’ve never forgotten that moment. That was a great moment!  
(Laughs) 
 
 I wondered if every crowd was the same. 
 
Well, yes, for the most part because in those days, TV wasn’t as popular 
as it is now. They didn’t have the movies, the CDs, or anything like that, 
so that kind of live entertainment was really appreciated. You’d get good 
crowds. We would play a series of schools up in New York for Jimmy 
Cole in the wintertime, and then we’d go on the road with the show or 
fairs in the summertime. The audience enjoyed what you were doing so 
much and that gives you a good feeling. They’re really happy. They like 
this. You’ve got a clown that goes out there, he’s a tramp clown, he goes 
out there, and he stumbles over his foot and he falls on his nose and 
everybody laughs like, “He’s happy! He’s happy! He’s making people 
happy!” That comedy sounds a little phony, but for me, that’s the way it 
was. I did my Spanish web and I came out in a black velvet cape, and I 
would take and swirl around and put my feathers out and take the cape 
off, and then I’d climb the web up and come down. I’d get a big hand. 
Everybody’s giving me a big hand. It’s a great feeling. You just can’t 
believe the feeling you get. I don’t know. They’re happy. They’re happy 
and that makes me happy, too. (Laughs) 
 
Was there much difference between the afternoon performance and the 
evening performance? Would you do the same thing? 
 
No, it was the same. There wasn’t a change. If somebody got sick or 
something like that, there was no change. It went on ding, ding, ding, 
ding—just like that. So you knew when your time came. You knew by

acts to go. I can change a diaper before I go.” (Laughs) You’ve got the 
liberty act, you’ve got the bull act, by the music, when the Roman Rings 
come on—you know whatever act is on in the big top from your trailer 
because of the music. Everybody has their own particular type of music. 
If it’s a speed up kind of event or a waltzy thing, you know what it is. 
 
So you didn’t have to stay within the tent itself while the show was going 
on? 
 
Oh, no. It was a bad thing to hang around by that back door in your 
wardrobe, I mean, unless the back doors were closed. They closed the 
back doors, or big curtain. You’ve got to have room for the elephants to 
go in. You can stand around there and talk, but you better not be right in 
that back door. You’ll be in trouble. That’s a no, no! (Laughs) The act 
that is in there deserves that courtesy too, because the audience is 
supposed to be watching the act that’s going on. They don’t want to 
watch people standing, running around in costumes in the back door. 
No, you had your rules, but everybody just seemed to automatically 
know what the rules were so you didn’t worry about it. 
 
Would you ever stop and watch the whole performance yourself? If your 
kids were well taken care of somewhere else, would you just stay in and 
watch the whole thing? 
 
No, because I was always in most of them, one way or the other. I did 
the swinging ladder. I did web. I did loop-de-loop. I did cloud swing. So 
I would be in and out of there several times. You’ve got to change 
costumes for each one so you don’t really have time for that. 
 
And you change in your trailer or was there a changing tent? 
 
Oh, no, in your own trailer, because I’m talking about small shows. I’m 
not talking about the Ringling Brothers or anything like that. I never was 
on any of those, thank goodness! (Laughs) The circus life was—it’s hard 
to describe and it must seem weird to town people, but you become a 
whole family. It’s like living in a real small town where you know all of 
your neighbors. You’re almost cloistered, in a way. Of course, your 
performers all gather in the back yard, and I think I explained that to you 
before. There were different groups, the working men and the front door 
people and the sideshow people, and then there are the performers in the 
big top. The matinee was always at two o’clock, and the night show was 
always at eight o’clock. They changed that drastically, later on. After the 
night show was over, everybody would take turns, having kind of a little 
picnic at their trailer. You would take turns. Somebody would have the 
food, this one, then the next one, the next one, and so forth, and you just

sit there and chew the rag and talk about old times and what for and so 
on. 
 
Relax a little bit. 
 
Yes, just laugh it up. (Laughs)  
 
Were most of your friends associated with the circus or were they town 
people or a little bit of both? 
 
Well, in the earlier years, it was the circus people, because you were an 
oddity to town people. They viewed you with a little bit of either fear or 
skepticism or sometimes just despise you altogether. When most people 
had a house in a town or in a city and they lived there all the time and 
they knew all their neighbors and here come all these gypsy-like people, 
following a tent, and performing. So you get cloistered. You get 
cloistered. That’s one of the things I like so much about Hugo.  
 
When we came to Hugo, we were welcomed. I mean, this was a great 
town for all of us, all the show people altogether. At one time or another, 
there have been over forty-five circuses wintered here, because they 
were welcome. They found out that we weren’t going to steal them 
blind. We weren’t going to ignore them, and so forth. We managed to 
circulate, and they found out we went to church and ate off of plates like 
they did and that sort of thing. (Laughs) Anybody who was footloose 
and fancy free was a vagabond and not trustworthy. They were afraid of 
you. They didn’t mind coming to watch you circus, but they didn’t want 
anything to do with you personally. If you look back you can understand 
that, because there are people that had bad people on a circus, just like 
there are bad people in a town. They go in and they may steal something 
and that sort of thing, and the people were afraid of us because we were 
vagabonds. And actually, we were vagabonds, but not the kind that they 
thought. 
 
Since you’ve retired, do you consider yourself a towner? How do you 
refer to yourself? 
 
I have found it rather difficult—I’ll have to admit—more so after my 
husband passed away. We were rather active in the town. We used to 
have a Kiwanis Club here, and I worked at the Kiwanis Club. I was in 
the ladies’ church societies, and Harry became president of the Lion’s 
Club. I became president of the Kiwanis Club, but I had to resign 
because coming out on the road in the summertime, there was nobody 
there to be in the Kiwanis Club. So I said, “You need to get a president 
that can be here all the time.” Well, they accepted that just fine so I 
could come and be in the Kiwanis Club when I was home in the

wintertime. The whole town accepted us. The first guy, I think, that had 
a circus here, used to run a grocery store. He had money and he 
bankrolled the circus. There was another one and he was a dentist here. I 
think his son’s still a dentist. He had an office uptown and he liked the 
circus. So he was a backer. You know, provided some money to get you 
over and so on. It just went from one thing to the other. The circus has 
generally found that this was a good town that would accept them. No, if 
I could turn the clock back, I’d do it all over again with joy, but time 
marches on. 
 
Let’s talk a little bit about when you moved from the trailer into the first 
house here in Hugo, as a married couple with children. What that was 
like? 
 
Well, our first house was over on North G Street, and we paid $3,500 for 
it. It took us a year or two to pay it off, because we had to pay it in 
payments. As I look back now, it really wasn’t much of a house, but I 
thought it was a castle—a house with running water, because we carried 
water in a milk can. The kids had to go to the water wagon and fill up 
our milk can to have water in the house. I just thought it was great, 
because we had a living room and we had a bedroom for all the kids. 
They had to be stacked high, but there were all the kids—and a bedroom 
for us and it had a dining room and it had a kitchen. You have no idea 
how much that kind of space means! (Laughs) The kids were only a few 
blocks from the school that they had to attend. That’s when the Fourth 
Ward school was there. So it was nice for us and of course, we would 
still be on the road and go out in the summertime. There was a real nice 
lady that lived over on the corner and she would look after our house—
not go in it, she’d just call us if anything bad was going on about the 
house. It took us a long time to pay for that house and we lived there—
gosh! How long? Quite awhile. Let’s see, who was born there? I think I 
had the last two kids from that house, yes. 
 
I would imagine that it felt like you had a whole lot more space. 
 
Oh, yes, yes. And you had privacy, too. In a trailer up at the front end 
over the hitch, you’ll have a sofa and you’ll have the door. If it’s big 
enough, you may have a little table that comes out, but other than that, 
the next place you’ve got your kitchen, stove, and your sink. And you’ve 
got your breakfast nook over here. Then, in the back of the trailer, 
you’ve got the double bed. Well, sometimes, the double bed has got to 
be made into a bed big enough for all the kids so, you’re sleeping in the 
little kitchen area. It turns around and makes a bed. As you get more 
kids, then you get the back room to yourself and you put the kids in the 
breakfast nook because it will all collapse down. You put mattresses in 
there and then you put a big board in between so that they’re like in a

bassinette, or a big bedroom. That Bobby John, you put him to bed, and 
he didn’t like to be touched so he’d start (imitates baby crying) and I’d 
say, “What’s the matter? What’s the matter, Bobby?” “He’s touching 
me!” Well, naturally, when there are four of them in there, somebody’s 
going to be touching somebody! He’d have a fit about that!  
 
But as time went on, there were twenty-eight foot trailers. I can 
remember one, the roofs used to be plastic. The sides were vinyl and the 
roof was canvas. We got into a windstorm one time, and it blew the roof 
off of the thing, and you can’t stop and get it fixed. In the first place, you 
can’t afford it, so you’ve got to fix it yourself. So Harry and I were 
repairing the roof. We rolled the canvas and we’d do a little bit each day, 
roll up the canvas, patch the roof, and go on to the next town. Roll up a 
little more canvas and patch the roof and go on to the next town. Then, 
we’d have to coat it with stuff to make it waterproof. Well, that was no 
easy thing to do either because you didn’t have time enough on a show 
to get the whole job done so you do part of it, and you do part the next 
time and the next time. That trailer was a Zimmer. It was the first trailer 
we had. It took us forever to pay for it!  
 
Lilly up at the grocery store loaned us the money to get the trailer. We 
had to have a down payment of two hundred dollars, and Dad went to 
the bank at Macks Creek and then he went to the bank in Camdenton. 
Turned him down, no luck, we had nothing. You didn’t have any kind of 
property that you owned or anything like that. So Lilly said, “I’ll tell you 
what,”—because we got to be real good friends with her and she said, 
“I’ll give you the two hundred dollars,” because we had a date on a show 
and we were headed out there and we didn’t have a place to live. When 
we got that Zimmer trailer that was another case that I was really 
thrilled, moving from a cracker box on wheels to a Zimmer trailer. 
Zimmer was a nice trailer in those days.  
 
I thought it was just great. Of course, when Willy came to live with us 
too, it wasn’t quite so great because he talked and he talked and he 
talked—all the time! If you didn’t listen, he’d poke you and say, “Did 
you hear that? Did you hear what I said?” He had this tale that he was 
telling you that you could care less about. He would ramble on and on 
and on and on. He had diabetes and he was a drinker. I told Harry, I said, 
“This isn’t going to work.” I said, “He’s drinking too much.” So finally, 
I put him on a diet. He worked the novelty stand at that time while I was 
still a performer. He’d come to the trailer after the tear down, when the 
show was tearing down, and I’d stop him at the door of the trailer and I 
would grab all of his money away from him, because if I didn’t, he’d 
drink. One night he came in and I had to search his hat, his hat band, his 
pockets, and everything to make sure I got the money. Well, he came in 
this one night and I said, “Is this it? Is that all?” (Imitates Willy

mumbling) I said, “Do you have any more money any place?” (Imitates 
mumbling) He had three silver dollars stuck underneath his tongue in his 
mouth! There’s always some guy on the show that will sell whiskey, and 
so I took that out of his mouth and put it away for him. I didn’t keep it 
myself, but I put it away for him.  
 
Then, I drove the car and Harry drove the truck and trailer. Willy was 
getting in the car with me and I had the kids in the back seat. I was 
looking for a map, and I went for a map and he had a bottle hidden in the 
glove compartment. I took the bottle and I poured it all out the window, 
like that. (Gestures) He said, “Mrs. Smart. You think you’re Mrs. Smart! 
That was a smart thing to do! You’re Mrs. Smart!” And he kept 
mumbling that all the way to the next town. (Laughs) I ditched his 
whiskey. He wore size fifty-eight trousers, and I took him down to size 
thirty-four by keeping him on a diet. He didn’t have near as much 
trouble with his asthma or anything and his diabetes. So one way or 
another, I won that battle. (Laughs) 
 
Willy was your father-in-law? 
 
He is my husband’s step-father. 
 
Step-father, okay. 
 
Of course, he had no place to go. He and Harry were always together, 
and so after we’d been married awhile, I fell heir to him. Willy was a 
good soul. He was a good soul. He just had this problem. He was nuts 
about the kids. He just loved the kids so you put up with it. 
 
As you traveled from city to city, did you remember much about the town 
you were just in? 
 
Well, no, not really because you follow the arrows to the lot, you’re on 
the lot, you set up. You may have gone to the grocery store or you may 
have gone to the Laundromat, but other than that, you don’t see much of 
the town. You get up and do your stuff, tear down the next day, and you 
go on to the next town so you don’t really get that acquainted in the 
town. Occasionally, somebody will come along that is not afraid to death 
of you and will start a visit and become kind of a friend, but it wasn’t 
much letter writing or that sort of thing. I mean, you’re here today and 
gone tomorrow so what’s the use? (Laughs) 
 
I just wondered if you got used to the geography. Like, which cities were 
where and whatnot. 
 
Well, in a fashion you do, but like I say, with me, my memory is so bad.

We used to go to New York every winter, because Jimmy Cole was a 
wintertime show and he booked all these high schools where they did 
performances there. Other than that, why, you didn’t really pay 
attention. One town was just like another after awhile. A lot of it had to 
do with how nice the people were. Some were good and some were not 
so good, but it didn’t really stick in your head very much. 
 
So you didn’t really have a favorite venue that you played for, then? 
 
You mean a route? 
 
Yes. 
 
Well, you don’t want to repeat the same towns over and over again. 
Now, you may play a series of towns this year and then maybe two years 
down the road, you might play those same towns again, but it’s a might. 
It all depends on what your agents can book. 
 
When it comes to picking a partner to be married to, was it easier if they 
come from a circus family too? 
 
Well, that’s a strange story, too, because we were showing in fairs and I 
met this farmer. I think I told you about him before. I was sort of 
engaged to him when we went down to Sebring, Florida to join the Buck 
Owens Show. That’s where I met Harry. Well, I didn’t think too much 
of it because I was still kind of enamored with the guy in Nebraska. He 
finally came around. Evidently, he liked me, but he was very bashful. 
Oh, he was so bashful! He’d finally come over and asked if I would go 
to church with him. Well, I found out he was a Catholic. I said, “Well, 
yes, I’ll go to church with you.” So we went to midnight mass. That was 
our first date. Then, I think I told you also, about the date at the soda-
pop night club. They didn’t sell whiskey, but if you brought your own, 
that was no problem of theirs. We got out there and got the Coca-Cola 
sitting down, sitting down in the chair, the music is going, and I’m 
ready—boy, I’m ready to go dancing! He said, “I forgot to tell you I 
don’t know how to dance.” So I danced the whole evening with his 
friend instead of him. (Laughs)  
 
We just became friends. I mean, there wasn’t any sweetheart thing about 
it, we just became friends. Then, he came and asked my dad if I could 
work in his whip act, holding the papers. Dad looked at him and kind of 
studied him. Harry was afraid of Dad. (Laughs) He said, “Well, if you 
promise not to hit her, I’ll let her try it.” So I began holding papers for 
him. The Buck Owens Show was half circus and half Wild West, and he 
worked in Wild West. He was a rope spinner, and he was a whip 
cracker, and he did the trick riding and so forth, and so he let me work in

his act.  
 
Well, he took me out to breakfast one time and we walked downtown 
and had breakfast. Of course, we were all stone broke. My folks were 
broke, the whole show was broke, and I didn’t think he had any money 
so I ordered real cheap. He orders ham and eggs and everything else like 
that and I thought, “Hmm, I made a mistake here. I should’ve ordered 
what I wanted!” (Laughs) But anyhow…he was cute. (Laughs) There’s a 
picture of him up there. (Gestures to the opposite wall) That’s when he 
was older, of course. 
 
I would think it would be easier for a marriage to work if both came 
from a circus background. 
 
Yes, and then another clincher was we were both of the same church 
belief. 
 
That’s true. Did you ever have to help in the cookhouse? 
 
I was the cook. One time, the cook blew the scene or he got fired and I 
had to do the cooking. This was on the Clyde Beatty-Cole Brothers 
show. I cooked for two weeks. I did all right. They seemed to like the 
food okay. (Laughter) They said I was a lot cleaner than the previous 
cook. (Laughs) 
 
Did you get to pick the menu or was it chosen for you? 
 
Well, it’s pretty much chosen for you, because it has got to be the kind 
of food that’s available in the town you’re in. It has to be something that 
you can cook ahead and keep hot and so on. So it’s not like fried chicken 
or anything like that. It’s a big pot of this or a big pot of that and so on. 
You’ve got things that you need. There’s somebody that does the buying 
for the cookhouse. The cook doesn’t do it. The cook makes the list and 
somebody else does the buying. I did that for a couple of weeks there, 
and I also did that for a short while on another show. I’ve also run the 
hot dog stand and the pie car. After I got to the point where I wasn’t in 
the show itself, I ran the novelty stand.  
 
I just learned how to get on Facebook. I’m not real thrilled with my 
ability on the computer, but I had two guys on there; one was Dave 
Donahue and he came on this Facebook. Well, I didn’t know him 
because when he was on the show with me, his name was Kilowatt. He 
was the electricity man. He was the one who plugged all the trailers into 
electricity, and he set the electricity all up from the generator and so 
forth. If somebody hadn’t told me it was Kilowatt, I would have never 
known who it was. He put a picture up there and he didn’t look anything

like he used to. (Laughs)  
 
There was another one I had on my novelty stand. Oh, I used to get so 
mad at him! He was tall and he was skinny. He had long, black hair. He 
thought he was God’s gift to women, and he had absolutely no qualms 
about anything. We would hit the lot and he’d go to a house across the 
street or near the lot and ask them if he could come in and take a bath. 
He’d go in and take a shower. And surprisingly, he was often invited in 
to where he could take a shower! When it came time to put that darn 
novelty stand up, which I had to do by myself, I drove the stakes and put 
the tent up, he was supposed to be there to help me. Well, he never 
showed up until the last stake was driven. You have to get it all ready in 
the morning and come show time, you’ve got to be out there when the 
crowd starts coming in if you’re going to do any business, because 
you’ve got to pitch all your stuff ahead of time. They don’t buy it then, 
but you’ve got to pitch it then. They go into the big top and the kid’s 
momma says, “That’s all right. I’ll get you one when we come out.” 
You’ve got to build that up. Ricky was never there! He was never there! 
He was always late! He was my inside butcher. He had to carry the toys 
into the big top and wave them around underneath the kids’ nose and so 
forth, but he was always late. 
 
I just got him on Facebook and he put his picture up there, and I didn’t 
recognize the picture at all. His tagline was, “Monkeys on a Stick.” 
Well, now, nobody but somebody like Ricky would remember that. We 
had the little fur monkey on a bamboo cane and so forth. Well, you can’t 
even get those anymore. They don’t make them anymore. They don’t 
ship them anymore. When he said, “Monkeys on a Stick,” I said, “Oh, 
for crying out loud! That’s Ricky!” (Laughs) He was tall, skinny, and 
this long, black hair. He looked like one of those—what did they call 
them in those days? The ones that were all protesting against everything 
in the United States, what do you call them? 
 
A hippie. 
 
Hippie, exactly! Hippie! (Laughs) Now, he’s round faced, moon faced, 
little heavier weight and so forth, and he wants to be my friend. (Laughs) 
Dave Donahue, the Kilowatt, he’s going to be here in August. He got 
married. He sent a picture of him and his bride, and he wanted to know 
if he could come and visit. I said, “Sure. C’mon over. I’d be glad to see 
you!” (Laughs) But I’m not very good on the computer at all. I get lost 
on it sometimes and can’t get out of it and get back. 
 
Sounds like you’re doing pretty good. (Laughter) 
 
Well, and all my kids are on it and I used to just email. Then they kept

Finchum 
 
 
saying, “Why don’t you get on Facebook?” Well, I’m a private person 
and I’m not too sure about getting my face out there on that computer, 
and so I hesitated a long time, but they finally got me on Facebook. I’ve 
got Margie and Bobby and Chris and Mike all live over in Durant. So I 
kept in contact with them that way. I’ve got all the kids.  
 
It is funny because when Harry and I were married, I didn’t really have 
the freedom and the opportunity to make too many close friends in town. 
I have some from my church now. We have a meeting that goes on in 
the basement of that church down there on the corner of Second Street. 
Anyway, it’s called a support group and it’s for widows and widowers to 
come and be a part of where somebody else knows what they’re going 
through and so on. Anyway, I became a part of that and I have made 
many friends from the Catholic Church. Of course, our church used to 
be full and now it’s about half empty. There are not many people there. 
I’ve gotten very closed in since my husband passed, because we went 
everywhere together. When we did anything, we did it together. It’s kind 
of hard for me to kind of go out and do things by myself. I just feel sort 
of lost. It was hard at first. David made me this little house, and I’m very 
happy with the house, and I know he’s right next door if I really need 
him or something. So I’m content. I’m content. 
 
[If there’s nothing more you want to add at this time we’ll say thank you, 
again, for sharing your circus memories with us.]
