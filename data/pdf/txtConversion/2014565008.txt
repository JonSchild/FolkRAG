TThe countries of the world to be found,
Will be represented on the Exposition ground,

For they realize a great thing to be represented in
‘The Panama Canal and Exposition swim.

Such a great display you've never sighted

It’s enough tomake the other countries frightened;
They are now too late to get in

The Panama Canal Exposition swim

I you've left your little babe at home,
‘And you think the folks will talk about you some,
Just you imitate the three wise monks and plang
‘yourself right in
‘The Panama Canal and Exposition swim.
When you're feeling sad and lonely, biue
‘The Panama Swim,

‘Thinking there is nothing in the world that you
brace up and laugh—ha! ha! and get in
‘The Panama Exposition swim.

If you're afraid that you'll be broke,
Why just bring along some things that you can
Roll up your sleeves, look around and get a job

‘and work right in
‘The Panama Canal and Exposition swim,
‘And you're ready now to leave, believe me,
‘When your good old money now isin the sea,
Come, brush up, get home and let them all know
You've been in the great Exposition swim.
