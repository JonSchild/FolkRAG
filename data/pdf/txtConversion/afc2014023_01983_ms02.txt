Introduction 
Eugene  
Brown, Sr. 
00:38 
Brown grew up in Savannah, Georgia. Graduated from  
high school, then attended Georgia Southern University. 
Taught school for a year and a half in Savannah. Worked 
part-time on the side in a clothing store. 
 
01:42 
Liked the clothing business. Took full time employment with 
a company that had clothing stores in “Historically Black 
College and University” (HBCU) communities. Company 
transferred him to Baton Rouge to open up a new branch 
store. Baton Rouge is home to Southern University. After 
four years, Brown bought them out.

02:51 
New store, Fashions Limited, located downtown Baton 
Rouge. Later changed the name of his business to Brown 
and Brown Custom Clothiers moving from ready made 
clothing to custom tailored clothing. 
 
03:21 
“I’ve always had a passion for clothing, even in my younger 
years.”  During his youth, Brown would use his earnings 
from summer jobs to buy tailor made clothing for back to 
school wear. “It was the way we pretty much did things. It 
was not elite, but certainly everyone didn’t do it...there was 
nothing special about me…I had a number of friends, I 
mean, that’s what we did.” Although everyday school 
clothes, it was more the fact of getting something made.

00:00 
“You were able to go and pick out exactly what you liked 
and get it made the way you wanted to get it made. Like I 
said, that’s what we did. It was kind of the folkway of where 
we grew up within our culture.”  
 
00:48 
Tailored school clothing tradition among Brown’s school 
friends. Reaction of classmates: “To some degree envied, 
for sure, but not ridiculed.” Brown’s mother early on would 
take him to the better stores downtown to buy his suits for 
church. Kept two suits for church. Early exposure to fine 
clothing helped foster Brown’s interest. “It was a special 
time. I was very fortunate in my upbringing.” 
 
02:56 
Always used the same tailor. Jewish gentleman by the 
name of Paderewski. 
 
03:10 
Brown bought jeans and kakis to wear with custom-made 
(school) shirts. Also kept two pair of tailor-made pants for 
special occasions.

05:12 
“When they talk about a community raising a child, that  
was especially true back then.” At school Brown was 
pushed by his teachers who wouldn’t take “no” for answer. 
In the days of segregation, State of Georgia would send 
aspiring Black teachers to top tier colleges and universities 
out of state for training. Many of Brown’s teachers in school 
were educated in this manner. “My teachers were the best 
of the best because of where they got their degrees from.” 
Brown’s brother has been president of several universities. 
 
10:07 
Father died early on. Brown raised by mother and her 
brothers and sisters. Brown named after his uncle who  
was a businessman. 
 
11:08  
Several of Brown’s friends worked for the prior mentioned 
men’s clothing chain store with locations in HBCU areas. 
That prompted Brown’s interest in applying there. “The 
grace of God first. OK. Grace and favor.” Secondly, “in my 
family you were just taught to think outside the box.” 
 
12:53 
At the age of 23, Brown sent from Savannah to Baton 
Rouge to open men’s clothing store at the corner of Florida  
Avenue and Riverside Mall. “Everything was different 40 
years ago. Today (Brown given store manager position at 
such a young age) that would not have happened.” 
 
14:29 
Somewhat informal training, but “I got an education in the 
clothing business that I could not have gotten at any formal 
institution in the United States.” Learning took place 
through experience, trial and error, some teaching. 
 
15:48  
Building a customer base in Baton Rouge as a Black man 
from elsewhere working for a Jewish-owned business. 
Brown was goal oriented. Taught from childhood about the 
benefits of hard work and dedication. “Everyday, thank 
God, I’m here putting the key in the door. Never do I get up 
and say, ‘My goodness, I got to go into work today.’” 
 
17:23 
Background as an athlete enables Brown to process fear 
properly and not let it overwhelm him.

18:31 
As manager Brown did all the buying for the new store at 
the market in New York City. Tells story of attempt “to wow 
them” at his new location. Miscalculated by buying double 
breasted suits ahead of the fashion curve in Baton Rouge. 
Men’s clothing styles in that era, prior to the advent of  
mass marketing on TV, started on both coasts then 
progressed inland. Miscalculation almost put him out of 
business. Taught Brown a lesson. Back then necessary to 
give styles some time before bringing them to Baton 
Rouge. Today with mass media must be on top of styles. 
 
21:10 
Brown talked about generational connection with his 
customers. Now serving second and third generations.  
“We develop a relationship.” 
 
22:07 
In the earlier years Brown’s customers had not been 
exposed to custom tailored clothing. Buying off the rack 
was the norm. 
 
23:06 
In Brown’s early days at his store downtown customer 
tastes for color were very pronounced. “If you wanted a 
lime green suit, we had one.” 
 
23:27 
End of second segment.

00:00 
Review of Brown’s history as discussed thus far. 
 
00:54 
Business decision to buy the store outright when parent 
company in Brown’s view, although closely knit together 
and somewhat of a family, “no longer wanted to 
compensate me and to make available the opportunity for 
me to be compensated as I should be.”   
 
02:10 
Brown opens Fashions Limited. Kept the same product 
lines with some variance. No longer regional. With new 
business Baton Rouge specific. Focus on local clientele in 
Baton Rouge.

04:00 
Folklife of dress in Baton Rouge. “Definitely helped shape 
it,” states Brown. Particularly with a one-store location, 
“people really believe in you rather than what you’re selling 
so you have to make sure that what you do is on point and 
they can trust you…I have your best interest at heart. I’m 
not just trying to make a sale.” Seek to help the customer 
create the aura or appearance he is trying to create.  
Brown related, you have to know, as well, something  
about people and where they are in life and what they are 
doing, because their clothing has to fit that. 
 
07:00 
How to put customers at ease when they might have to 
step out of their mold. “We try to reference someone they 
can identify with that’s in the mainstream to see that this is 
acceptable and this is where they should be.” Otherwise, 
the customer might not completely buy into it. 
 
08:42 
Was or is there a Baton Rouge look? No, it was more  
about trying to fall within the framework that was going on 
nationally. Given exposure in movies and on TV, “we had 
to be within that framework of what they were seeing 
without being too fashion forward.” 
 
10:00 
When Brown first started in Baton Rouge seven or eight 
men’s clothing stores were in operation. Fashions Limited 
four years running before closing. Then Brown opens 
Brown and Brown Master Clothiers going after the custom 
tailored clothing market. Decision influenced by plethora of 
chain stores in the area that began selling both men’s and 
women’s clothing. 
 
11:45 
Transition into custom tailored clothing represented niche 
market relatively unexploited. Brown’s perspective was to 
offer custom tailored clothing at an affordable price 
because the norm was (is) high end, high priced. (Note: 
Whistling tea kettle audible in the background starting at 
11:14.) 
 
12:29 
End of third segment.

00:00 
Parents did not have things laid out with a silver spoon. 
Brown had to learn how to take advantage of opportunities. 
“Blessed in that there have been opportunities and I had 
the insight and understanding as to how to seize them.”  
Many business decisions have turned out well. Speaks to 
notion of calculated risk. Importance of thinking outside the 
box. Don’t necessarily have to do things as others have. 
Need to be creative in your thinking. “We have been 
blessed to be able to do that, and I’m just thankful for it.” 
 
02:55 
Had a customer base already. Matter of educating them as 
to what exactly Brown and Brown was doing. “I would like 
to think they all during their formative years, they knew 
someone who bought custom clothing.” Custom clothing 
out of reach because of price. “We felt like we could make 
it affordable, and that’s what we did.” 
 
05:01 
Brown and Brown still maintained some off the rack 
suitings for those customers who preferred that option over 
a custom made suit. 
 
06:02 
If the customer opts for a custom made suit over a ready 
made suit, in Brown’s opinion they will never go back to an 
off the rack suit because of the comfort and being able to 
get exactly what they want. 
 
07:22 
Brown commented about all the variables that go into the 
ritual of fitting a customer for a custom-made suit. “It would 
be hard to miss us with a color or style of fabric because 
the size of our offering of fabrics, I must say myself, is 
somewhat amazing.” 
 
09:22 
End of fourth segment.

Interviewer breaks interviewees comments down into a 
matrix. The expressive occupational culture; the folklife of a 
clothier.

02:07 
As a business entity, Brown commented on wanting to be 
“an integral part of a community and an integral part of a 
family’s life.” Has now had the opportunity to cloth fathers, 
sons, and now grandsons spanning three generations. In 
doing so the business touches many facets of family and 
community life extending out to rituals which include 
marriages, anniversaries, and funerals. When someone is 
nattily attired, Brown’s hope is that people will say, “I bet 
that came from Brown and Brown.” Whenever a garment 
goes out the door, “you always want to put your best foot 
forward.” Important that Brown and Brown continue to have 
a recognizable place in the community. 
 
05:09 
Brown talked about the importance of having his son in the 
business. Brown would have been a plumber like his father 
had his father lived longer. “It’s something for me to be able 
to pass on something to my son or to have something that 
is really larger than the both of us in that we are building 
something that will hopefully continue on and we’ll be able 
to pass on for generations. It was both important and 
special to me to have him (Eugene, Jr.) be a part of this.” 
 
06:47 
Appreciation expressed by the interviewer for the time 
taken. Brown responded: “...hopefully we’ve been able to 
shed light and participate in your work and endeavor in a 
positive manner, and we just thank you for the opportunity.”
