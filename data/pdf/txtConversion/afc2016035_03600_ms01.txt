Louis Alvarez interviewed by Paul Vance, Setare Arashloo, and Barrie Cline

Louis Alvarez: 
Paul Vance: 
Perfect. All right, so I guess we're going to start with the easiest one. Please tell 
us your name and your job title. 
My name is Louis Alvarez, and my jobtitle? 
Yup. 
I am currently a shop steward at Roosevelt Island, employed by EJ Electric. I 
work for [00:00:30] a business agent called Kenny Forsberg, who is a business 
agent for midtown Manhattan, because Roosevelt Island is considered part of 
Manhattan. I'm also ... 
Okay, many hats. 
... an officer of Local 3. I've been an officer for about four years now. I first 
started in the examining board, and now I am currently on the executive board 
of Local 3. I'll see you on Monday. 
[00:01:00] Okay. Oh, man. The pressure's on. You work for a business agent, can 
you explain that a little bit? 
Yeah, okay, I can explain that. Business agents are an extension of the business 
manager. Business agents are responsible to handle the union relationship 
[00:01:30] with the owners and the contractors. They overlook their jurisdiction 
and make sure that all the work is being done accordingto our bylaws and our 
constitution. They have people, they can't man their jurisdiction by themselves, 
so there are stewards who are hired by the business manager and by the 
business agents, and [00:02:00] they are an extension of the business a gent and 
the business manager. 
A steward, what he does, is he represents the men on the job. He protects the 
jurisdiction of Local 3, and he also protects the contractor's interests, as well. 
Okay. What was your third hat that you wore, the third job that you ... 
Not my third, but I'm also an electrician on the job. The [00:02:30] stewards, 
they work as electricians out in the field. I'm also an officer of Local 3, I'm on the 
executive board of Local 3. 
Can you explain that a little bit more? 
Louis Alvarez: 
Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
Sure. Well, there's five executive board members in Local 3. We are, according 
to the bylaws of Local 3 and the constitution of the IBEW, every local has 
officers. They have a president, [00:03:00] they have a vice-president, they have 
exam board officers, and they have a treasurer, recording secretary, and of 
course, executive board. Executive board is basically kind of like the governing 
body of Local 3. We take actions on all different types of things that may come 
up that affect the union as a whole, as a whole entity. We represent all 29,000 
members of the local. 
[00:03:30] You're doing this on top of ... 
Doing this on top of my regular day job. 
... being an electrician. 
Yeah. I have to go to the local, to the union hall several times a month. 
According to the bylaws, we have to attend at least two executive board 
meetings a month. We also are involved with participating withdrawal cards, we 
swear people in, we give people their cards, we reinstate members back into 
[00:04:00] the local, we handle all types of things that affect the union, yeah. 
Do you live in the city? 
I live in Long Island City, Queens. Born and raised. 
You were raised here, okay. What's your background? 
As far as what? 
Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
You said you were from, are you from this neighborhood, Long Island City? 
I was born and raised on the other end of Long Island City that borders Astoria. 
[00:04:30] I lived there basically my whole life. Born in '67, my parents were 
there since 1963. My mom died in the same apartment that she arrived from. 
My parents immigrated from Colombia, along with my four older brothers. I was 
born in '67, and I was raised in that apartment until I was old enough, until I 
went away to college, and then basically I was out of the house from that point 
on. 
Was anyone in your [00:05:00] family a part of the local, or in construction, or... 
No, no. My father was not a tradesman, he was a printer by trade. My mom was 
a housewife. None of my older brothers were in construction. Yeah, that's not 
true, my next oldest brother was a plumber at the time. I could have gone that 
route, but I had two older relatives who are [00:05:30] still with the union who 
were young, one was an apprentice and the other one was a mechanic, at the 
time, and they were heavily, heavily involved with Local 3. When I was 17 years

old, in high school, they were already selling me on the idea to get into Local 3 
because I had no idea what it was. The only thing I learned about it was from 
them. I asked around, and I realized what [00:06:00] a great opportunity it was, 
because it was a great union, as it is today, with good benefits, and it was a 
career. I wasn't sure if I was going to do it right after school. I always had it on a 
back burner. I went to college for two years, and then, after college, I dropped 
out, and after two years I ... 
What did you study? 
Business administration. I went to SUNY Farmingdale, and then I decided that, 
you know what? I'm not going to do that. I didn't [00:06:30] know what I was 
going to do. I had taken the fire department test. 
Did you have any other jobs prior to ... 
I had a few jobs, yeah. I drove fora while, after college. I decided I was going to 
quit college one day, I picked up the paper, I picked up the help wanted. I 
looked in the help wanted ads, and I made a few phone calls, and I went for an 
interview that same day. That same day, I went for an interview at a sheet metal 
compa ny. 
I could have gone in the direction, too, I could have been a union sheet metal 
worker, [00:07:00] because I drove, they hired me. I started the next, and I just 
never went back to school. I could have gone that route, as well, because as I 
was driving for the sheet metal company, I did that for like eight months, I 
became friendly with a lot of the guys on the job. They were telling me about 
their union. Even some of those guys told me, when I told them I had an option 
to get into Local 3, they were all like, "Do the electricians." 
You said you had a lot [00:07:30] of opportunities to join other local, was it easy, 
at the time, to ... 
Get into the local? 
Because you just hear about all these lines and stuff. 
It was, no. Back when I got in, the long lines that you would have to wait for to 
get your application was no longer. It was the same exact process that we go 
through today. You had to send inthe request forthe application, and you had 
to wait to get the application, and then you had to follow the steps. I got 
[00:08:00] in the way everybody else gets in today. We had the same quota, 
2,000 people on the first day, and then they would just stop it. If you didn't get 
your application in on the first day, you were done.

Actually, I could have gotten into the local a year earlier, when I started that 
sheet metal job, around that time. I wanted to get into the local, and I had just 
missed the deadline by like a week. Yeah, it didn't happen. 
[00:08:30] Working in the sheet metal ... 
Compa ny. 
... company, did any of those skills help, like, migrate over into? 
I was only driving, so yeah, I became a much better driver. Back then, we didn't 
have cell phones. Back then, it was the big, giant brick cell phones, and you had 
to be like an executive to drive around one of those. We had beepers. 
[00:09:00] The beepers wouldn't even give you the phone number. The beeper 
would go off, and you would go to a public phone, and call up the shop, and find 
out what it was that they wanted. I learned how to drive, and yeah, I learned 
how to get around, navigate around the city. It was a good experience. I liked it. 
Was that like yourfirst time navigating around the city? 
Driving, yes. I grew up in Queens, I would take the subway if I had to go 
anywhere. I had a car at an early age, but I never [00:09:30] really, there was no 
need to drive around, like in some parts of Brooklyn or the Bronx. I never had 
any reason to go to those spots. Everything was basically local or upstate. 
Can you remember and describe what yourfirst day of work was like? 
Oh, I can tell you my very first day of work, oh yeah. I had a road atlas, and they 
gave me an address of East Broadway. I didn't know that there was a West 
[00:10:00] Broadway, there was a Broadway, and there was an East Broadway. 
West Broadway and East Broadway are very short, and I couldn't find this 
freaking address for the life of me. I kept driving down Broadway, I couldn't find 
the building. 
I called the up. This is my first day, I called up the shop, and he really needed, I 
forgot what it was that I had for the workers, but they really needed it. It was 
the end of the workday, they left. Before that happened, I called up the shop, 
and the guy, the dispatcher [00:10:30] that was workingfor Aabco Sheet Metal 
at the time, I can't remember his name, he said, "If you don't get to this job, 
you're fired. I swear to God, you're fired if you don't find ..." 
Now, I nevergot to the job or anything, and then, all right, so I head back to the 
job. I'm like, "Ah, fuck, I'm fired. It's my first day at work, and I'm done." 
This is at the sheet metal...

This is a sheet metal company. When I get to the shop, he was fired. [00:11:00] 
He got fired. For, all the reasons, that to this day I don't know why, but I know 
he screwed up something really bad. He was gone. A guy called Tom Brady then 
became the dispatcher, who happened, we got along so well. Tom Brady was a 
great guy, and we became very friendly, but I came back, and I thought I was 
gone, but he was gone. 
Oh, good. You were just like ... 
Did you tell him off and say, "In fact, you are gone." 
Yeah, yeah. It was like, "Wow. [00:11:30] Somebody was looking after me." 
Was it a similar situation on your first day as an electrician? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Like, the same kind of vibe? 
Today's February 24th, right? You guys never put the date down, by the way. 
Today's February 24th, 2017. Yesterday was my anniversary, and it was 28 years 
ago that I started my very first day in Local 3 for Forest Datacom. I went to 
[00:12:00] this building on 388 Greenwich Street. It's this huge office building, 
right in Tribeca, like a couple of blocks away from Robert De Niro's studio. First 
time I was ever in Tribeca, too, it was really cool. 
I get to the job site, and I get on the Ala mac, and I go up to 12th floor or 
something like that. I get off the elevator, I had my electrician's tools, and I was 
all excited, because I was going to be an electrician, and I wanted [00:12:30] to 
work as an electrician, you know, learn electrical stuff. I was really upset 
because I found out that they're a data company, and they were a data 
company, and they weren't doing any electrical work. It was all telephone work. 
I get off the elevator, and I find my sub-foreman, and his name was George [Ca- 
lal-la[ 00:12:50]. He used to teach telephone at the union. He used to teach the 
telephone skills at the union, and he was the meanest [00:13:00] son of a bitch. 
He was so mean. 
I'll never forget, I had an earring in my ear, and he goes, "Who are you?" I'm 
like, "Louie Alvarez, I'm here, I'm a TA1." He was like, "Take that earring out of 
your ear!" I had to take my earring out, I was shaking. I was like, "All right, what 
do I do?" He was like, "Grab that broom, go in that office, and sweep it out." I'm 
like, "Ah, fuck." 
Did he give you a reason why? 
Because he was just a dick.

Ah, really? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Just so he could get that [crosstalk 00:13:30]? 
He used to [00:13:30] treat apprentices really, really bad. We became friends. I 
realized after a while he wasn't a bad guy. It was a love-hate relationship 
because sometimes he'd come down really, really hard on me, and then 
sometimes he was just really sweet and would take care of me. 
How old were you at the time? 
22. 
Oh, wow, so [crosstalk 00:13:51]. 
Yeah, 22, yeah. 
You said there was like a difference, in your mind, between the telephone 
[00:14:00] and the electrical side of it, and you were disappointed, kind of. Why 
I was so disappointed. For nine months I was bitching, and moaning, and 
complaining. Look, I learned a lot of stuff. 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
As a matter of fact, I learned to color code, which was great, and I learned how 
to punch down a telephone cable, which is, you know, it's not easy. When you 
learn the color code, then you'll know what to do, and you'll know how to take a 
900 par-a-cab-le[ 00:14:25] apart and fan it all out, and you'll learn to put that 
onto [00:14:30] phone blocks. To this day, the color code is still used in phone. 
They've changed the designs a lot, a nd I don't do it a nymore, but the color cod's 
the same. 
For a long time, I was bitching, and moaning, and complaining. At the time, the 
apprentice director's name was Buddy Jackson. We would have our monthly 
apprentice union meetings. For a whole bunch of times, I got up right after the 
meeting, and I [00:15:00] would approach him, and I would complain to him and 
tell him that I wanted to get transferred, that I wanted to be an electrician. I 
didn't want to do data. 
The whole year wasn't even over with time to get rotated. There's about nine or 
ten months. We were in the winter, it was winter time, and I finally got in 
rotation, so I get rotated. I'm really excited. I get my job ticket. The guys on the 
job, the crew that I worked with, they threw a little party for me. They took a

collection, [00:15:30] they gave me a card with money and everything, and they 
got me drunk, and all this good stuff. The next day I go to the job, it's directly 
across the street. 
At the time, in Battery Park, the only area that was built up was up to where the 
four main office buildings are, where the atrium is and everything. One of thems 
the American Express building. From that point north, it was all empty lots. It 
was just one big, [00:16:00] empty lot, except for Stuyvesant High School. It was 
a deck job. Guess where I got sent? 
Right across the street, [crosstalk 00:16:09] ... 
Right in the middle of the winter. 
... day. [crosstalk 00:16:12]. 
Yeah, yeah. It was for a company called Commerce Electric, and we were doing 
a lot of the work in the street right outside of the building. It was cold, and it 
sucked, and yeah. 
Can you describe your current [00:16:30] job site? 
Current job site where I work now? 
Yeah, yeah. 
I'm working on Roosevelt Island at the Cornell New York Tech Project. There's a 
total of four buildings that just went up. I'm employed by EJ Electric, we had a 
couple of contracts there. There's a total, between all the contractors that are 
there, there's about 150 electricians. 
Oh, wow. 
Yeah, and it's a great site. 
It's 150 electricians, but [00:17:00] all separated different shops? 
Separated different companies, yeah. 
Yeah, so each ... 
The one company's got like 50, another one's got like 30, another one's got 20, 
yeah. 
Is there something about your job site that you're at now that you enjoy?

Yeah, I love it architecturally, it's beautiful, the buildings are gorgeous. Yeah. It's 
this big, eco-friendly, [00:17:30] high energy-efficient project, as well. They've 
got thermal heat, and they've got solar panels going up. The buildings are put up 
energy efficient. It's pretty neat. Architecturally, it's nice. It's close to home, 
that's another thing. I got to see the project come right out of the ground when 
it was just a hole in the ground, not one piece of steel was up or anything. I got 
to see a project from when it was just a hole in the ground to, I'm going to be 
there, I think until [00:18:00] the very last piece of molding is put in. 
Wow, that's a lot. What type of work do you find yourself doing at this particular 
job site, now? 
What type of work? 
Like, are you doing anything specifically there? You, specifically. 
The contractor that I'm working with, we're doing what we call [Core and shell 
00:18:23] shell. The Core and shell of the building is the structure of the building 
[00:18:30] before any customers go in and do a build-out. It's the whole outside 
of a building, and the core of the building, there's like where the elevators are 
and everything, and then the electrical service into the building, and the fire 
alarm system we're doing, as well, and all of the lighting that's not in any 
customer's space. We're doing all of that work. 
Wow. 
It's a lot of conduit work, a lot of wires, and putting up fixtures. 
Are [00:19:00] you specifically doing more conduit work, or are you doing ... 
All conduit work, yeah. 
You are? 
Yeah, yeah. 
Can you explain how you learned the skills that you had as an electrician? You 
started out as doing data, but did you have any prior knowledge in [crosstalk 
00:19:26]? 
No, no. I had as little knowledge as most of our apprentices [00:19:30] have 
when they get in the business is, a lot of the apprentices come in not even 
knowing how to swing a hammer. I already had a little bit of construction skills 
under my belt when I got in, it's not like I hadn't been ... Never on a big project 
like that, because I was ... My brother, I hel ped my brother in the summer, one 
summer, as a plumber. We used to go to houses and stuff, and the company 
that I worked for, and things around the house, as well.

My older brother was [00:20:00] always very mechanically inclined when it 
came to construction, and tools, and stuff. I kind of led by his ... 
Shadowed him? 
Yeah, yeah, because I found that I had the skill forthat, as well. I think it runs in 
the family, because my younger brother never had any electrical skills, and he's 
a heck of a great mechanic. Funny story, you guys, we were just here at my 
apartment, and I was showing you artwork that my oldest brother did. 
[00:20:30] Was he the plumber? 
No, the oldest brother was an artist. But, I'll never forget this. When I separated 
with my wife, he was living on Java Street at the time in Greenpoint, so I moved 
in with him. He had this big, big studio. We took a little section, and we put up 
studs, and we put up these partition walls. A couple of friends of mine came 
over to help me, and they had way too many beers, so they weren't really 
working that well, and my brother, [00:21:00] out of frustration, he just, he took 
the screw gun, and he and I were working together, and that was the first time 
he and I ever worked with tools together because I never really saw him 
working with tools. I could tell you that he picked up that screw gun, and it was 
probably the first time he ever used it, and it was like he was a pro. Just, zip, zip, 
zip, zip. 
Some people just don't have it in them. They can't get a screw in the wall. He's 
bangingthem out like nothing. I think maybe that just kind of runs inthe family, 
[crosstalk 00:21:30]. 
Do you think [00:21:30] that? 
Yeah, yeah, I think that. 
I mean, like... 
I believe that, sure. 
How long have you been working in electric? 
I think some people are born with some type of intelligence or whatever, and I 
think in my family, because my brothers, not to brag, but we're all pretty decent 
mechanics. One of my brothers does plumbing as well as, he's in electric work, 
does plumbing on the side. Like I said, my younger brother never had any 
construction skills, and he just got in the trade, and he's a good mechanic. 
Do you think you learned more from [00:22:00] being on a job site, or did they 
have like, class work and stuff like they do now?

Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
Yeah. Well, no, it wasn't as good as you guys, they have it now, that amazing 
training center. We didn't have hands-on training when I was an apprentice. The 
only thing that was hands-on was the motor control work that we did. 
Everything else you learned was on the job. I always picked up on stuff. I never 
really had a hard time. 
Were you ever [00:22:30] scared of working in a particular location, or with a 
tool, or something like that? 
Never. 
Never? 
Never ever did I feel any fear to do anything that anybody gave me to do. Not 
even afraid of failing. Somehow, I always went, and to this day, I go in not 
knowing that I don't know. That's okay. Obviously, you're going to be put in a 
situation, you're going to be put in with somebody who knows. You're going to 
learn [00:23:00] from that person. To this day, I'm not afraid of starting anything 
new, of starting a ny task, a nd I just pay attention, and I learn what I got to learn. 
You're still learning. 
There's always new stuff to learn. I did fiber-optic for like 2.5 years, and I'd 
never touched that stuff before, but I was hooked up with these great 
mecha nics, a nd they were good teachers. If you had a good relationshi p a nd you 
get along with the person who you're with, whether you are an apprentice and 
he's a mechanic, or you're a mechanic and he's got more skill in there. If you get 
along [00:23:30] with the person and you guys hit it off well, there's no reason 
why he's not going to want to share that information and that knowledge with 
you, because that's just human nature. 
Can you tell me about some of your co-workers now? Do you have a particular 
partner that you're working with? 
No, right now I'm mostly solo. I'm also, I cannot be put on a task where it's very 
time-consuming. 
As a stewa rd ? 
As a steward, because at any moment I could get a phone call from one of the 
[00:24:00] other job sites where I have to run out and take care of something. I 
get a phone call from the business agent, I have to take care of something. At 
any moment, I could be pulled off of that project. When I'm given something to 
do, it's something that, they'll put somebody with me where he could just 
continue with the job if I have to leave.

Can you walk me through like a typical day for you? Since you are a steward, it 
seems to differ a little bit from what a [00:24:30] regular mechanic would like ... 
Yeah. A typical day is, I go to work. We do our stretching in the morning. 
Do you? Do you [crosstalk 00:24:37]? 
Yeah, we do, yeah, yeah. EJ Electric has a policy where on their time, on 
company time, right before the day starts, or right when the day starts at seven 
o'clock in the morning, we all muster up right outside the shanty ... 
That's not through the contractor? 
Huh? 
I worked on a job where it was the contractor... 
It's not through the GC, no. We're working for Turner right now, and they don't 
do it on my site. EJ [00:25:00] has a new policy. 
Oh, really? 
Now, I don't know if they do it on all the other job sites, but they do it on mine, 
and it's totally cool, because I think it's great. 
What kind of stretches? 
[crosstalk 00:25:12] 
We have a whole routine, which is great. We stretch our legs, our lower back. 
We stretch our arms, our shoulders, our wrists, our neck, do a stretch, neck, you 
know. We have a great routine that we follow, same exact routine every single 
day. It's pretty cool. It's about 15 minutes [00:25:30] long, and the contractor's 
paying for this. It's on his time, it's not on our personal time. 
We do that, we stretch out and everything, and then whatever it is that I could 
be of assistance to somebody else, I'll tag up with that person. Like I said, I'm 
not beholden to complete that task. I may have to ... 
If you have a call. 
For whatever reason, I may have to leave, yeah. 
Then, do you work on another job site for a little bit? 
No, no, just that one in particular. [00:26:00] I can only work for EJ, so I can't 
work for another contractor physically.

Oh, so you're going on calls for other... 
If the foreman on the other job site has something, an issue that may have 
come up that day, he'll call me, and then I'll walk over, and then we'll talk about 
it. If we have to talk to a worker, then we talk to a worker. If a worker calls me 
and he's got an issue, I'll come over and talk with him. Sometimes it's safety 
issues, or whatever it may be. 
What [00:26:30] is it mostly? 
A lot of it is safety, a lot of it is safety, but we're not safety officers, so you have 
to know how to try and handle that. Because safety policy is, the responsibility 
falls on the contractor, not on the local. Although we train people on safety, and 
we pay for workers, our members, to do an OSHA 10 class, or [00:27:00] for 
supervision to do an OSHA 30 class, we'll train them. Their safety responsibility 
on the job site is the responsibility of the contractor. We just try to address it 
and bring it to their attention so they can fix the problem. 
Or, there could be a jurisdictional issue where another contractor or another 
trade is trying to do our work because they think that they can get away with it. 
Or, [00:27:30] the general contractor that you're working with is trying to hire a 
non-union contractor to do a portion of the work, and we have to step in, 
especially if it's a PLA job, because usually PLA contract states that all of the 
work has to be done by the signatory union that sign off to that PLA. 
Sorry, would you mind, because not everyone who listens to this would 
understand, like a short definition of a PLA? 
PLA is a project labor agreement. It's usually an agreement [00:28:00] between 
the building trades and whichever customer that you're working for. Customer 
could be a customer of one particular project that's going up, or it could be a 
huge project, like, say, the Hudson Yards project, or it could be Brookfields. 
Brookfields owns a lot of property throughout Manhattan, it could be a PLA 
agreement with Brookfield, or it could be the school construction authority. 
Every single contract is a different PLA. A lot of the language [00:28:30] is cookie 
cutter from one to the other, but every individual project, they may tweak it a 
certain way, one way of the other. Usually, they're kind of cookie cutter, though. 
The project labor agreement, what it is, it's that the building trades, in order to 
ensure that that project is going to be, that the manpower are going to be by 
the building trades unions. Building trades are, [00:29:00] it's like an 
organization of all the different labor unions throughout the city that belong to 
the building trades. The PLA goes out to all the individual local unions, and if 
their business manager or whoever their principal officer is, whether it be their 
president or their business manager, agrees to the terms of the PLA, he will then 
sign on to that PLA. Every local union has to agree to that PLA if they want their 
workers to follow [00:29:30] those rules.

Now, you have this agreement, which all of the rules that are in PLA may not 
follow all of the rules of those individual local unions. There may be some 
discrepancies, or there may be some concessions that are made, but these are 
all things that are negotiated so we're sure to be on that job. For instance, Local 
3 on a PLA, we're the signatory union to do the electrical [00:30:00] work there. 
If we're the only union signed onto that PLA that does electrical work, that 
means that all of the electricians that are on that job, for whatever contractor it 
may be, has to be from Local 3, or Local 1 with the plumbers, or local 638 with 
the steam-fitters, and so on. 
That's basically in a nutshell what a PLA is, which is great, because there's 
specific rules that people have to follow. I was able to [00:30:30] address certain 
issues on the job. They tried to hire a company that was going to put in these 
motor controls for the windows, and the motor controls were low voltage. 
These guys were non-electricians, they were installers of these motors, and they 
were goingto try and install the cable. We were like, "No, no, by New York City 
electrical code, that's the job of an electrician." I don't care who you hire, along 
as it's a signatory contractor that's on [00:31:00] this PLA, because you guys 
agreed to the PLA, so you can only have Local 3... 
Were the window guys from New York? 
The window guys were like, they were like this non-union shop. They weren't 
even installing the windows, they were just installing these little motors, which 
they couldn't even do that. 
Mm-hmm (affirmative), I see. 
They couldn't even be on a project because they were non-union. 
Is there a certain demographic that makes up your job site right now? Is it 
mostly A, is it MU, or... 
It's mostly A, and apprentices, [00:31:30] and mechanics. The mechanics that 
get A rate, yeah. 
I have ... 
Except one of the projects that are on my project, it's a PLA, an 80-20 PLA. 80-20 
is like, they get 80% of the full rate, but within that, it's a residential project. 
Within that project, we have workers from the new division that we just 
[00:32:00] formed to tackle the residential problem that we're having, that 
we're losing a lot of work to non-union. We have a new division with these 
workers, called RWs or RE electricians. 
You have different PLAs on the same site?

Louis Alvarez: 
Yeah, yeah. Several, several. Yup, every single project there's four contractors 
on, and with every contractor there's a separate PLA. 
Is there a type of work that you find [00:32:30] yourself to excel at? Since you 
started off doing data work, do you ... 
Electrical work I excel at. Basically, fit-out work, which is like basic circuitry and 
stuff I excel at, but I have dabbled in a lot of different things. Throughout my 
career, they'll say I'm kind of like a jack-of-all. There's things that I've never 
touched. 
Still. 
I've worked on large conduit, like four-inch conduit, [00:33:00] but I would 
never tell anybody that I am proficient at doing concentric bends large conduit. 
When it comes to smaller conduit, I can bend it pretty well. I did fiber-optic for a 
couple of years. I also held a license for a few years, as well. I'm a New York City 
master electrician. I had to give up my license. I gave up my license a few years 
ago when I became an officer of Local 3, especially on the executive board, 
because then there's [00:33:30] a conflict of interest, but I held a license for a 
company called Allan Briteway. I would attend a lot of inspections and stuff like 
that, and I worked as a project manager in their office for five years, which was 
a great experience, too, because I got to see our business from a different 
perspective, as a person in the office, as a project manager as opposed to being 
a foreman out in the field. Also worked as a foreman, as well. 
Being a jack-of-all-trades type, [00:34:00] is there any specific skills that you find 
necessary to have to complete your jobs and stuff throughout the day? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you got to be well-organized. You have to be well- 
organized, and you got to know your task for the day, and you have to try to 
complete what you started out to complete. I always like to tell people, start 
with the hardest thing in the morning. Yeah, [00:34:30] there's one thing that I 
think that a lot of electricians should know, and that's more code, New York City 
code. Because I held a license, I also got involved with the code classes that we 
have at the local. We teach our members how to be more informed on the New 
York City electrical code. I was one of the crew that helped develop that class. 
I'm still involved with it in a certain way. 
I'm, not very well-versed, [00:35:00] but I'm probably a little bit better-versed in 
the code than a lot of the guys out there. It's important to know the code 
because it tells you how to install things the right way and according to the law, 
because New York City electrical code is the law. The analogy I like to use is like 
this. You can be a real good car-driver, you know? A real great car-driver, 
[00:35:30] be an excellent, and you have great instincts, you know how to avoid 
accidents, you know to think what people are doing beforehand. You could do 
figure eights, you could drive fast, you could weave in and out of traffic. If you 
Lou 
Page 14 of 26 
Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
Paul Vance: 
Louis Alvarez: 
Seta re Arashloo: 
Louis Alvarez: 
don't know the traffic laws, if you don't know the traffic laws, you don't know 
the speed limits, you don't know that you can't do certain things because 
they're illegal, you're dangerous. 
That's kind of like the same thing with the code. If you don't know how to install 
something [00:36:00] by code, you could possibly be doing an illegal act that 
needs to be repaired or corrected at some point. That's a loss of money, and 
that's an embarrassment to the local, because we're supposed to be well- 
trained electricians, and it's an embarrassment for the company that you work 
for. 
Where does the code come from? Kind of like, where do these laws get started? 
Is it [00:36:30] from trial and error, or is it like ... 
Yeah, trial and error. It's a lot of science behind it, too, as well, because 
electricity, it's physics. It's basically to protect equipment and people, to prevent 
fires. That's there's an electrical code. Nation electrical code, and then every 
jurisdiction has their own version of the code, as well, as we do in New York 
City. It's to prevent fires, to prevent accidents, prevent people from getting 
electrocuted, [00:37:00] places burning down, equipment blowing up, and 
things falling on your head. 
It was something that evolved since like the 1900s. It's been evolving ever since. 
We had, we call it the Ed Koch book. That was a code that existed for a while, 
and not until 2001, right after 9/11, did things start changing big-time in New 
York [00:37:30] City and throughout the nation. We revamped our code, and we 
took the national standard, and in New York City, we add our amendments, 
because there's some things that we're a little more stringent on than the 
national electrical code. We've revised it every so many years. It hasn't been 
revised since 2011, which is the current. 
How often do they revise it? 
It's supposed to be every three years, but it hasn't been revised since 2011 right 
now. It [00:38:00] takes a while to revise. 
Has your job ever felt creative to you? 
Has it ever felt creative? Yeah, sure. A lot of times you run into situation that 
you have to figure out a problem. It could be anything. It could be an 
obstruction in the way, something that was not foreseen on a drawing, and 
you've got to work around it. You have be creative and be a problem solver. Of 
course, yeah. 
Now, [00:38:30] if you're thinking of more like an artistic way, there are things 
on a job that we do and that we take a lot of pride in, like say, for instance, 
when guys are tying in a circuit panel, a breaker panel, and you have all these

wires that just came into it. A lot of men take a lot of pride in shaping all of 
those wires in there very nice, and neat, and very professional, with sharp 
angles, and make it look neat, and take a lot of pride in that. It takes a little 
more time, but when a customer walks around and he sees that [00:39:00] 
quality work, there's a saying that quality remains long after the price is 
forgotten, because he knows he's paying for some quality work. When you see 
beautiful conduit work, as well, it takes a lot of skill to do that, but aesthetically, 
it's beautiful, and you know you're getting quality stuff. Yeah. 
Do you have a favorite tool? 
A favorite tool? 
Yeah. 
My pliers. 
Cool. Have you ever customized them, or do you have any specific ... 
Pliers [00:39:30] and the screwdriver. That's an electrician's two main tools. 
What kind of screwdriver? 
I like to use a multi-head, because I could swap it around with the Phillips or the 
different sizes, yeah. 
Have you ever passed down a tool or have any tool passed down to you? 
Yes, an electrical tester. When I got into the local in 1989,1 had a cousin who 
was doing construction, non-union, but he moved to Colombia, and he gave me 
an electrical tester. [00:40:00] To this day, I still have the same tester. 
No way. 
I was thinking about giving it to my nephew that just got in last month, but his 
brother's goingto get in in September, so I didn't want to give him one and then 
not the other. I think I'll probably have to hold onto that. Yeah, I still have it to 
this day. 
That's great. 
Yeah. 
What has it meant to be a union member to you? 
To be a union member? It's like a part of a big [00:40:30] family. To be a union 
member, you belong to an organization that's protecting your best interests. It's

amazing. I think everybody should be unionized in whatever they do. It's a 
shame that union membership throughout the country has been dropping, 
especially since Reagan was president. It means a lot to me, because it's my life. 
I could have gone out and maybe started my own business, [00:41:00] and gone 
out on my own and stuff, but ( Lou's phone rings)... Sorry. 
I love the brotherhood, and I love the camaraderie. I say brotherhood, we have 
sisters too, but brotherhood, the sisterhood. I love the camaraderie between 
my fellow union members. It's just great to feel that. It's like you're part of this 
big family, that everybody's out to help you, for the most part. [00:41:30] We all 
have a common goal, and it's the betterment of the worker. I like it so much. 
I've been involved for a while. 
Do you have a tradition that you ... 
Huh? 
Do you have a tradition that you enjoy about... ? 
A tradition? 
Like a Local 3 tradition, or something like that? 
Well, I don't know, let's see. 
Like coffee, union meetings ... 
Oh, I got you. 
[crosstalk 00:41:59] 
[crosstalk 00:41:59] 
[00:42:00] Ritual, like a ritual? 
Is there an event or something that you ... 
I have, I belong to a few clubs. There's one of the clubs that I actually came up 
through, and it's the Hispanic club, which is called the Santiago Iglesias 
Educational Society. It's one of the clubs that I belong to, which I think clubs are 
very important for the Local. It's where I learned to become more active in my 
community, and to give back to the Local. I learned, [00:42:30] it's like a 
fraternal organization, but there's sisters in it too, so that may be the wrong 
word. 
I love going to my club meetings. You mentioned coffee break, coffee break is 
awesome in the morning. It's a great ritual, because it's just a nice little break in

the morning. It's cool to sit with the guys that you're working with that day, and 
you just shoot the shit and learn about each other's lives and stuff. 
Do you have like a coffee break story that you tell [00:43:00] to your friends or 
something? 
No, I don't know, man. Anybody just talks about anything, you know, whatever 
comes to mind. Sometimes when you're having a problem, like say with your 
house, or construction, or you're doing a repair, you're going to add a deck or 
whatever it is. Sometimes you just throw that question out there, somebody 
may have had the same experience, and so you learn from everybody else, and 
then you learn what hobbies other people are into. 
We've got guys that are great musicians, we've got guys that are artists, they 
can paint. [00:43:30] You get guys, we have this one guy that loves board 
games. One of my coworkers loves board games. Not electric games, but board 
games, he just, he goes. He's a fanatic, he loves ... He actually started a group 
where they meet at a bar like once a week and they play board games. You 
meet people that have all these different facets ... 
Do you have hobbies? 
Huh? 
Do you have hobbies? 
My hobby is just, right now, at the moment, I think it's welding. 
Oh, really? 
Yeah, but I switch around. I have a new hobby like every six months. [00:44:00] 
Right now it's welding, and I'm actually taking a welding class. I've already made 
a couple of pieces, before I got into the welding class I made a couple of 
projects. 
With the union, or is it... 
No, it's just on my own. Oh, the class I'm taking is with the union right now. 
Oh, really? 
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Oh, nice. 
It's a skill that we offer.

If you want to give advice to a young apprentice or someone who just has 
started as an electrician, what would that be? 
Like I said before, don't be afraid [00:44:30] of doing anything. You need to be 
cautious, you know, electricity could kill you. You got to be cautious, a nd you've 
got to be concerned about your safety, but don't be afraid of tackling any 
project or try to solve any problem. Because once you show fear, that in itself is 
going to defeat you, right there. You're going to fail. 
Fear and having respect for something is two different [00:45:00] things. Just 
going, and try to learn as much as you can. Especially today with YouTube, you 
can learn so much on YouTube. Just try and be as good as you can, whatever 
project that you're working on. Try to be a well-rounded electrician by learning 
all different tasks on the job site that you're doing. Don't get stuck doing the 
same thing all the time. Hope that when you get rotated after every year you go 
to a shop that's doing some kind of different type of work, [00:45:30] and just 
learn as much as you can, yeah. 
Was there ever a point where your job felt particularly meaningful? Was there 
ever a job site that you finished, or a task that you did, that you did ... 
Like, real meaningful? 
I mean, or like, maybe something every day, you're like, "I love my job because I 
get to do this every day." 
I remember once I worked for two [00:46:00] weeks on the Williamsburg Bridge 
on a necklace sliding on the cables. I was in heaven for two weeks. 
Yeah? 
If you do something like that, you get paid high time, you get safety pay, extra 
pay. You get time and a half. I used to say to myself, "I would do this for straight 
time." 
Why is that? What is it that [crosstalk 00:46:22] ... 
Because I had the adventure of climbing up those cables on the bridge and 
actually standing on the very tippy-top of the tower [00:46:30] of the 
Williamsburg Bridge, all the way at the very, very top, standing there. It's a lot 
bigger than you think. It's not like a little thing or you're going to fall off, it's a lot 
bigger. Walking up and down those cables, and repairing the lights and 
everything, cool stuff. Very cool. 
That's a view not many people get to have ever in their lives. 
Yeah. 
Lou

Louis Alvarez: 
Something that was very meaningful though, when I was working, I'll tell you 
this to add to that question. [00:47:00] After 9/11,1 was doing fiber-optics at the 
time, that's when I was doing the fiber work. I was working with [U-O-Cane 
00:47:08], and we had the Verizon account, and we did a lot of work down by 
ground zero. Yeah, and we get paid good money, but you also felt like you were 
part of the whole cleanup, and you were helpingthe city. 
You were helping. 
Yeah, sure. Not only that, but some of us, we'd also volunteer [00:47:30] and 
help at the dig-out. Yeah, sure, I was on the pile a few times. I volunteered to be 
on the pile with firefighters, and cops, and other construction workers, on my 
own time, and then go, and help, and remove debris. I was up on top of the pile 
with firefighters that were actually digging with their hands, with little shovels, 
and hand-digging debris, and I was part of that whole big bucket line, the line. 
Then, we would pass debris. Then, [00:48:00] the whistle would blow every now 
and then because they would think that they found somebody, like a body part 
or something, and everything would go silent. I never actually got to see a body 
getting pulled out, but then we'd resume our dig. It's pretty meaningful. 
Did you have access to that because you were an electrician? 
Yeah, because I was doing fiber work. What happened is that a lot of the fiber 
was going into Tower One, I think it was. There was like these main hubs there. 
[00:48:30] When anybody usually gets a fiber-optic run, they run two lines, they 
run a redundant line, because like what happened at 9/11, a lot of the lines are 
severed, but they had another, they had a redundant line that came in from 
another direction. Some people lost service, but a lot of people did not lose 
service because of that backup. 
Now, you have these companies that really depend on these fiber networks that 
lost [00:49:00] their main. Now we had to rush and replace a lot of this fiber, 
and repair a lot of the manholes down there. We were working in manholes 
right at 9/11, right there. 
Can you say a little more about an electrician's role at that time? I remember 
hearing something about that, that electricians had been coming in, early on. 
Not along with first responders, but early on. 
[00:49:30] Local 3 lost 17 brothers, we lost 17 brothers in the two towers. I 
almost lost one of my cousins. He was a steward in one of the buildings at the 
time, but he happened to be in the basement, I believe, when the planes hit. He 
could have very easily been doing work at one of the top floors, and we would 
have lost him. We were going crazy. We thought he was dead until he finally 
was able to communicate. We lost four brothers from the IBW from Local 12-12, 
who were in the television division.

[00:50:00] Yeah, so it was traumatic for us, as well. A lot of firefighters died, and 
a lot of other people died, as well, but we lost our few, also. Local 3 played a big 
role in helping with the emergency lights and with the power that needed to 
come back up. Construction workers don't get enough credit for the work that 
were there. The first responders were the first responders. They were doing 
their job. Their job was to be first [00:50:30] responders. They were brave. They 
were doing their job. We also lost people, as well, and we were also a very 
important part of rebuilding of getting all of that shit out of there, fixing what 
needed to be fixed, at the time, temporarily, and rebuilding new. 
Have you ever been given a compliment on something that you've done? 
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't remember anything, but... 
I mean like, [00:51:00] by like ... Okay. Do you overtake work home with you, or 
is it somethingthat... 
When I was project manager, I would bring work home with me, yeah. This table 
right here would sometimes be full of blueprints. Yeah, so yeah. Yeah. 
Do you think the work that you [00:51:30] do now as an electrician is going to 
be somethingthat is going to stay in sync, or is it going to change? Do you find 
the work that you're doing changing? 
Well, it's always changing. It's always evolving, the electrical technology. 10 
years ago we didn't have as many LEDs as we do now. Everything has LED lights 
now, electronic ballast, like everything is [00:52:00] computer chips and less 
relays. Everything's computer-based and electronic-based. The technology just 
keeps changing. 
Is there anything in particular that you see that... 
There's stuff that I look at now I'm like, "I don't know what to do, I don't know 
how to install this. I don't know what to do with this," because I'd never seen it 
before. There's always, even the tools that we use are constantly changing, as 
well. That bender that you were using today, [00:52:30] like that, when I was 
coming up in ... That style of bender is only maybe about 10 years old, it's not 
that old. 
What's the bender that you're using? 
A side-winder, yeah. Yeah. 
Was it one that has like the ... 
I was just taking picture ...

but I'll answer it with this. Yeah, if the labor laws could change more in our 
favor, and if we had more laws protect the union work in the city, that would be 
pretty awesome. 
That would be on top [00:53:30] of the list? 
[crosstalk 00:53:30]? Yeah. 
Hm? 
What would be on top of the list for [crosstalk 00:53:34]? 
Well, right now I'm scared to death of losing Davis Bacon and Right to Work 
coming into effect nationwide. That would be detrimental to unions. 
Could you explain for [crosstalk 00:53:48]? 
Yeah, it would do a lot of damage to unions. I'm afraid of that happening. I hope 
that doesn't happen. 
What is that, exactly? Can you ... 
Right to Work law [00:54:00] is basically this. We call it Right to Work for Less, 
but Right to Work is this. If there was a Right to Work law in New York state, 
which there isn't. If there was, and you were being represented by a union, and 
you didn't feel like being a member of that union and pay dues into that union, 
you don't have to, but that union is collectively bargaining on your behalf 
[00:54:30] still. You are benefiting and getting the same benefits as the brother 
that's next to you. At that moment, you're not a brother any more. You're a 
scab. You're benefiting from the person that's paying union dues, because their 
organization is representing you as well as the dues-paying members. 
What happens is that now a lot of people, for whatever reasons, because they 
just won't feel like paying dues, or because they can't, financially, they're

strapped, and maybe that's one of the things that they don't have [00:55:00] to 
pay for, well, what happens? Less money goes to the union. The union, they're 
not effectively funded, and they can't effectively do their job to represent all the 
members. They'll have less staff, and it's harder. That's a way of killing unions. 
The Davis Bacon act is a law that was passed during the ... Help me out here, 
please? The, FDR's time. The New Deal. 
New Deal, yeah. 
[00:55:30] The New Deal, and it was a law that it basically states that all 
government contracts that go out have to pay the prevailing rate of the area. 
With New York City, Local 3 sets the prevailing rate for electrical work. We are 
the better rate, and we have the best benefits. Any government contracts that 
go out, a non-union guy could bid on that job, but if a non-union guy gets that 
job, he has to pay his workers the prevailing [00:56:00] rate of the union, 
because we set the prevailing rate, because we're the highest rate. They have to 
pay their workers our benefits and our rates, our wages. That keeps the 
standard up high. 
If you didn't have Davis Bacon, which means now any contractor that bids on a 
government contract could go in and put a low-balled price in. He could put in a 
very low price, and pay their workers a shit rate. No benefits, [00:56:30] if they 
wanted to, and that's another way of killing unions, because it evens the playing 
field, and I'm afraid of losing that. 
Do you feel like you're compensated enough as a ... 
Yeah, yeah. I feel, I think we have great wages and great benefits. I have no 
complaints with it. The fact that we're even getting a raise in this new contract 
is great. 
Awesome. 
I'm very proud of the money we make. We don't make the money that a banker 
makes, [00:57:00] or a guy working in finance on Wall Street, but we make a 
decent livingwhere you could afford a nice house, you could afford a nice car, 
you could afford to feed your family and live in a decent area, a decent house. 
It's a very respectable living. 
Have you ever been injured on the job? 
Yeah, I've had minor injuries. I've [inaudible 00:57:19] my wrist, I pulled my back 
out a few times, but nothing earth-shattering where I had to miss a lot of time. 
Is there [00:57:30] anything that inspires you?

To what? 
I mean, to do the work that you do, to wake up in the morning, to [crosstalk 
00:57:40] ... 
Listen, like any job, sometimes it sucks getting up in the morning. 
I mean, like, but... 
Sometimes you get inspired by the other guys. If you're working on a project 
that you're excited about, you want to see it to its completion, all the guys that 
are into it as well, they could inspire you to do a good job. If you're working for a 
good [00:58:00] foreman ... Sometimes you work with guys that just are such 
great mechanics, and they inspire you to better yourself. You want to be as 
good or better tha n them. 
Have you ever worked on another Williamsburg Bridge type of spot? 
Yeah, yeah. I worked on the Brooklyn Bridge. 
Oh yea h, a nothe r bri dge? 
Yeah, yeah. I've worked on the Brooklyn Bridge, as well, in 1991. I was an 
apprentice at the time, but I got my MU [00:58:30] card on that time. I wasn't 
allowed to do a ny high time, but I did work a lot on the bridge. I also worked on 
the Henry Hudson Bridge, underneath the bridge, as well. That was pretty cool. I 
got high-time for that, and that was a fun ... And, on the George Washington 
Bridge. I did all the controls for the sprinkler lines on the George Washington 
bridge, yeah. A little bit on the [Throgsneck 00:58:53], but that was just a few 
times. 
Is there a reason they keep on sending you to all these bridges? 
Yeah, yeah. That was a company called [Climber 00:58:59] of Electric, [00:59:00] 
and they're still around, and they would get, and they still do, they get a lot of 
public work. They get a lot of public projects, and they do stuff like that, like 
bridges, they do subway work. Yeah, it was cool. It's cool work. A lot of it was 
working with rigid. 
Oh, yeah? 
I got to work with rigid a lot, and some guys don't ever get to work with rigid 
much, because they're not exposed to it. 
With what? 
Rigid ?

Rigid conduit is the type of conduit that I was showing you today [00:59:30] that 
has the threads on it. It's a very thick wall, and you can use it... It's got the 
galvanization on it, so it doesn't rust. Yeah, that's rigid conduit. 
You were saying that they mostly use it for outside, but sometimes [crosstalk 
00:59:42], 
Sometimes indoors, when the code requires it. 
Like a fire alarm or something like that. 
Like fire alarm, or fire pumps, or sometimes the code it specified that certain 
areas have to have it, or sometimes a customer may specify that they want it in 
their contract, and they'll pay for it. [01:00:00] Yeah. 
Thank you so much. I was wondering one last thing, if there was anything else 
that you would want to add, knowing that this is a bit of a time capsule or a 
snapshot of your work, and your work in Local 3? 
A story? 
Anything else you might want to add, or that you'd like to close with? 
All right, if this is a time capsule, and maybe somewhere down the road, 50 
years from now, somebody will be [01:00:30] listening to it, I'm going to get a 
little political right now. We are, under this current administration, with this 
president who I will name as president number 45, because I won't even refer 
to him by name. If you want to guess who it is, just look up to see who the 45th 
president was, or the president that followed Barack Obama. How he won was 
really upsetting for everybody. [01:01:00] The platform that he ran on was very 
upsetting for everybody. One of the things that I'm petrified about is, like I 
mentioned before, Davis Bacon, the new supreme court judge that he's going to 
pick who's going to be conservative, and Right to Work laws. 
We're very afraid that because Congress is all Republican, as well, and they all 
[01:01:30] normally vote anti-union than pro-union on a lot of their legislations, 
as proven from state to state. We're very afraid that he's going to pass 
legislation or he'll sign off on legislation that is going to be detrimental to unions 
and the labor movement throughout the country. Hopefully that doesn't 
happen, and hopefully [01:02:00] in two years we'll get to overturn Congress, 
and put some Democrats back in there, and hopefully in four years, if he doesn't 
get impeached before that because he's so crooked, hopefully in four years we'll 
knock him out of that spot as well. Yeah. 
Thank you. 
Yeah. Thank you.
