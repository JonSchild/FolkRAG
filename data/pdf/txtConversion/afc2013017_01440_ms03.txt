A math poem written by Janet Rowney, as mentioned in her interview: 
 
Math used to be so wonderful because it was black and white. 
 
There was a right answer.  Everything else was wrong. 
 
You learned the steps you needed to take.  You got the right answer.  
You were happy. 
 
Even if you were wrong, you knew your goal: the right answer. 
 
So you went back, followed the steps again, and eventually got: the right answer. 
 
And you were happy. 
 
I learned the "how" before the "why", but I went back to understand concepts 
more thoroughly because: 
 
1) I got the right answer. 
2) Getting the right answer made me happy. 
3) I liked feeling happy. 
4) I associated learning as much as I could about math with - being happy. 
 
And there was life. 
 
And it wasn't black and white. 
And sometimes goals weren't clear. 
And even if they were, you didn't know the steps to get there. 
 
But when things got bad... 
 
There was always math. 
 
Where there was a right answer. 
 
And if you followed the steps, you could get the right answer. 
 
And you felt happy. 
 
Sigh. 
 
And that is what the brilliant Dr. Fuson missed in her research. 
 
With Math Expressions, we have all lost happy.
