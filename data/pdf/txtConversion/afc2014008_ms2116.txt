THAT WHICH ENDURES
 (rewite from transcription of 11/11/95
 
speech)
 
What  is  "that which endures"?
 Naturally I have been thinking
 
about this  for the last few days,  for we have been in an
 
awfully complicated meeting with a lot of ideas floating
 
around and a lot of interesting problems that  I never even
 
thought about before,  frankly.  So I don't have any real  final
 
ideas,  just a few notions to float out here along with a
 
bunch of little  stories,  vignettes  from my experience,  with a
 
few words  in between to try to explain what  I got out of
 
them.  And maybe  some of the  sum of it will make a kind of
 
sense.  And I thought  I would start with a story that my
 
father liked to tell.
 
My father was born in  1867,  and he used to say this story was
 
probably pretty old when he  learned it.  It was about an old
 
country fellow who came home from church one morning,  and
 
told his wife about the new preacher in town,  and his report
 
went:  "Well,  this new fellow,  he spoke the unspeakable and
 
he  said the unsayable, and he unscrewed the  inscrutable.  But
 
you know what,  Martha,  he never did say wherein."
 
And during this
 nference we have been saying the unsayable,
 
speaking the unspeakable and yesterday,  in that marvellous
 
media session,  we did some unscrewing of the  inscrutable,  but
 
we haven't really been talking about the wherein -
-
 which is,
 
of course,  art.
 
Now this  is very characteristic of conferences in general,
 
and I think the planners of this particular conference are to
 
be complimented on the fact that there has  so far been any
 
mention at all of the  subject that brings us all here. When I
 
used to work for the Endowment,  I went to meeting after
 
meeting in which the topic was art,  but art was rarely part
 
of the conversation and frequently never came up at all on
 
the  floor or in the  speeches.  This  is because,  you see,
 
Americans are such great technicians.  We love to think about
 
how to do it,  no matter what  "it"  is.  (I now must edit
 
myself.  What  I had intended to say was that Americans of
 
European backgrounds are marvellous technicians and such
 
folks tend to talk excessively about how to do things and
 
relatively little about what they are doing)
 
Artists,  on the other hand,  are not  "how" people,  they are
 
"what" people and they
 are out doing the "what" as hard as
 
they can go.  In fact,  I believe that  is why we have artists
 
around,  and why they are such awkward people to deal with so
 
much of the time.  They are doing things without consideration
 
of "how" except  in terms of their own individual  "how"
 
problems,  which of course they have to take up themselves.
 
Essentially they are  focussed on  "what"
 
So that  is  "what" we are dealing with.  That  is what  is
 
enduring -
-
 art and trouble.  Those are the two things  I
 
thought of right away when  I saw this title -
-
 art and
 
trouble.  Nothing stops them.  We change them,  we fool with
 
them,  we make different ways  for them to evidence themselves,
 
but they are constant  in the human experience.
 
When I was  in my teens,  I was going to college in
 
Philadelphia and I used to come down to see my folks  in
 
Washington D.C.  every couple of months.
 One time  I came and
 
the WPA -
-
 the whole Works Progress Adminiustration wasnm't
 
there.  It was a big place;  it employed lots of people,  and it
 
was gone!  The desks,  the chairs,  the telephones,  the electric
 
fans,  the  file cabinets.
 They were  just gone.  They still
 
turn up every once in a while in Washington in someone's
 
garage or cellar;  a little piece of the WPA washes to the
 
surface and gets put  into an archive.
 
But the entity was gone.  It was a real  shock.  I didn't know
 
things disappeared like that.  Years  later when I got a job at
 
the BNational Endowment  for the Arts,  the very first day I
 
walked into what was to be the Folk Arts Program  (it was  just
 
an empty little room with a desk and a stenographer's chair
 
that had about a five  foot high pile of correspondence)  I
 
asked "What am I supposed to do?" And they said,  Take care of
 
that." And I sat down and thought to myself,  "Bess,  you;' d
 
better work fast.
 You; d better think what ytou want to do
 
and get on with it,  girl,  because this place  is going to
 
explode on you too one of these days.  One of these days,  you
 
are going to come to work and it  is not going to be here."
 
Thinking that way right  from the very first day informed
 
everything I did with a sense of "you only have this chance
 
for a little while".  So,  if it doesn't work that way,  let's
 
try it this way.  Let's work as  flexibly and as steadily and
 
as purposefully as we possibly can and try to get as much
 
done as possible because this whole place is  liable to blow
 
up one of these days.  Everything does.  There  isn't anything
 
constant but art and trouble.
 
There is a folklorist who wrote a very interesting paper in
 
which he pointed out that amongst the people  in the United
 
States who communicate basically in English,  there are two
 
different  clusters of traditional tales that  center around
 
two different main characters.  He thought both the characters
 
and the  stories  represent two different ways Americans  like
 
to think of getting things done.
 
One of those characters is Paul Bunyan and,  like John Henry
 
in  some ways,  he got things done by virtue of power and
 
muscle,  size and energy.  He made the Great Lakes by stomping
 
a bug that was biting him and he made the rivers  flow
 
backwards and he blew the  forests down.  He was the epitome of
 
raw power.  The other group of stories have to do with Brer
 
Rabbit and also,  by the way,  the  Jack and the Beanstalk
 
fellow about whom similar stories are told.  They are the same
 
kind of leading character because they are not very big,  in
 
fact they are small and get things done by virtue of being
 
witty,  cunning,  fast moving and able to change directions
 
very quickly but  still keep going for what they want.
 
So when I began at the Endowment,  another thing that came to
 
my mind was that paper,  and it was plain to see that  I wasn't
 
one of the Paul Bunyan kind.  I had less than $50,000  for my
 
first years budget and that knocked me right out of the Paul
 
Bunyan class.  So I was going to have to be a Brer Rabbit.
 
At this conference  I have  looked around this room and heard
 
different people talk and spotted some Paul Bunyans and some
 
Brer Rabbits and I suspect that the Foundation world is a
 
compound of groups that are using these two different
 
strategies,  Both of them are,  of course,  very good in terms
 
of getting things done.  I do not claim one is better than the
 
other. Which strategy you use has to do with the relative size
 
you are and the relative gifts you have to offer and what
 
kinds of power you can bring to whatever your particular
 
problems are.
 
But to return briefly to the WPA situation,  after it  fell,  I
 
noticed it was gone and I am sure a lot of other people
 
noticed it was gone too.  But the  sun came up the next morning
 
and the moon rose that night,  and things wen't on happening.
 
Art didn't  stop and trouble didn't  stop;  they just got
 
organized differently,  especially in that the art occurred in
 
different places  so that  it was  seen or heard by different
 
people.  This made for changes
 
Maybe those changes would have occurred if the WPA had stayed
 
alive,  I don't know.  But  I do know that,  as Bella Lewitzsky
 
pointed out  so vividly in her talk,  the enormous black hole
 
that was  left by the disappearance of the WPA was very
 
quickly occupied by a number of forces that had helped
 
engineer its collapse,  because government doesn't  stand for
 
vacancies.  I was concerned to sense a number of people here
 
thinking the Endowment  is now effectively out of the picture
 
so we will have to manage by working out various  coalitions
 
of smaller groups.
 That  is a good Brer Rabbit  strategy,  but
 
I would point out that  it will operate  in opposition to some
 
Paul Bunyans,  politically speaking,  who are preparing to move
 
into the vacancies that will occur should the Endowment
 
collapse.
 
One of the things  I believe needs to happen is that the
 
conversation should stop centering so much on the Arts
 
Endowment and turn to discussing what  is  important about
 
federal participation in the arts anyway?
 What would be the
 
ideal way of organizing federal activity? Shall we recommend
 
re-creating the Endowment  in gentler times? Or what? We need
 
to have some ideas.  Otherwise we may well be  left with a
 
black hole that will be very very difficult to defend.
 
Now if you notice,  I have with the best of intentions been
 
talking almost exclusively about the "hows"  instead of the
 
"whats".  I can't help it;  it  just bubbles out of me.  I am a
 
standard European American and I love technology;  I love to
 
think about how to do things.  I have been telling you a
 
little bit about how to be a Brer Rabbit and how to be a Paul
 
Bunyan and I haven't told you about what at all.  But now let
 
me propose a "how" that we can actually turn into a "what" if
 
we  just go and do it.
 
I think we must  say that,  in the world of the arts,  it  is
 
time to stop talking about multiculturalism and be
  
multicultural.  We go on and on and on discussing it and we
 
don't  "be"  it primarily because it  is  such hard work.  It
 
really is.  Being multi-cultural  is very difficult not because
 
of a lack of good intentions but because it  is hard to
 
understand other peoples and other peoples have a hard time
 
understanding us.
 
My brother in law was  in the Merchant Marine during World
 
Watr II,  and he got  stuck waiting for a shipment  in a bleak
 
port  in North Africa,  really just a bunch of sheds,  not a
 
cafe,  not a store,  nothing.  So he made  friends with a little
 
Arab boy,  a son of a local  laborer.  The child spoke a couple
 
of English words and Pete  learned a couple of Arabic words
 
and they played finger games and drew things  in the sand,
 
amusing each other and trying to be friends.
 
One day the little boy said,  "I write English".  Pete said,
 
"Oh,  wow,  can you?  I' ll get you a piece of paper and you show
 
me." So he got out  some paper and a pencil and the little boy
 
made four staggering capitals,  writing right to left -
-
 P,  I.
 
H.  S.  It  spelled SHIP when you looked at  it.  There it was!
 
SHIP!  The  little boy had copied it  from the sides of the
 
anchored freighters,  and he did it  just  fine.  He was making a
 
good solid Arab try at a cross-cultural experience,  using all
 
the  skills he knew  (working harder than Pete was at the time,
 
actually.)
 
And he was  right -
-
 he could spell SHIP.  But because he was
 
going from right to left  instead of left to right,  he
 
couldn't build on what he thought he knew -
-
 he couldn't
 
spell PUSH for instance.  But he was working so hard.
 
That SHIP comes  into my mind all the time when I am talking
 
with people from other cultures,  because  I always need to
 
remind myself deep inside that things  I think I understand
 
could be backwards.  I could be operating just the wrong way
 
around,  and so could the people who are trying so hard to get
 
together with me.
 
Now,  my dear friends,  when you really understand that,  when
 
you get that  into your heads permanently,  you are going to
 
drop this terrible metaphor we use -
-
 the model of the
 
grantor and the  supplicant,  the  lord and the peasant who is
 
coming in to get  funding.  You are not going to think that way
 
any more. You are going to realize instead that you are
 
working with people conjointly on a problem connected with
 
art  into which you can put  in some money,  perhaps,  but,  they
 
have to put  in some things too.  It  is a reciprocal
 
relationship you have  set up there,  and I urge you to try it,
 
to use it as a model.
 
I was thinking yesterday that at this meeting we are actually
 
talking about philanthropy.  We are working within this
 
culture's philanthropic system and suddenly it hit me that we
 
are only talking in terms of our own;  we don't talk about
 
anybody else's  system of philanthropy,  do we?
 
Now peoples other than western Europeans take care of their
 
educational systems and their health systems and their arts
 
too,  and so they have developed ways of doing all that.  But
 
we rarely think to bring other ways into the discussion.  I
 
know,  just  from visiting a little bit,  that most American
 
Indian tribes,  for example,  have a philanthropic system that
 
is very reciprocal.  They have potlatches and giveaways and,
 
when you give somebody something,  they are obligated to give
 
something back.  Now that puts a different  spin on how we
 
should be giving money in the  Indian world,  doesn't  it? Maybe
 
we are putting burdens on people.  Maybe they want or need to
 
accept those burdens,  but maybe the discussion of the
 
transaction ought to be different,  which is what  I am
 
suggesting here.  Maybe we ought to think  (
though in all
 
honesty I have to point out to you that here comes another
 
"how"  instead of a "what")  about other systems that might
 
work better.
 
Whether you are a Paul Bunyan or a Brer Rabbit,  I would like
 
to see you to take on a problem or two,  not  just an
 
institution.  One of the strongest advantages of the old Folk
 
and Traditional Arts Program was that our field was so
 
underinstitutionalized we didn't have to spend most of our
 
energy working with institutional complexities.  Most of you
 
are  stuck with them,  but you can begin to reduce their size a
 
bit.
 
Try thinking in terms of problems  for a change.  How about
 
doing something to try to take care of the very real needs of
 
the performing arts? They need rehearsal spaces,  they need
 
publicity materials,  they need all kinds of things right
 
across the board from New York to California.  And visual
 
artists need marketing knowhow and supplies.  How about  some
 
kind of a cheap warehouse where people could buy not-for-
profit-priced photographic materials,  or clay,  paint and
 
canvas?
 
There was  once an old blind lady named Emma Dusenberry.  She
 
lived in Mena,  Arkansas and she was born blind and she sang.
 
By the time any folklorist  found her,  she knew hundreds and
 
hbundreds of songs all the way through.  She sat there with
 
her blind eyes  looking out at whatever she saw in her head,
 
and she was  just a river of song.  One time somebody asked her
 
how she came to know so many songs,  and she said,  "Well,  you
 
know when  I was a little girl  I decided I was going to learn
 
every song in the world.  Every single one.  And so every song
 
I heard,  I learned it,  and I learned and I learned and that
 
is how I know these  songs." The  folklorist  said to her,
 
"Well,  Mrs.  Dusenberry,  did you succeed in learning all the
 
songs  in the world? Did you ever get there?" She said,  "No,  I
 
had to quit.  They kept on making up new ones."
 
I think that  is the beauty of the work we are involved in.
 
The artists and the troubles are out there enduring,  and they
 
keep on making up new ones  for us,  so we'll always have
 
something exciting to do and to get together about and to
 
join hands on and to have a wonderful time with.  So finish up
 
your meeting in great  spirits,  go home,  add just maybe one
 
what to your hows and maybe one problem to your institutional
 
list and remember what you' ve  learned these  last three days.
 
And if you ever want to talk about  it  all,  just call me on
 
the telephone.
 
THAT WHICH ENDURES
 (rewite  from transcription of 11/11/95

What  is  "that which endures"?
 Naturally I have been thinking
 
about this  for the last  few days,  for we have been in an
 
awfully complicated meeting with a lot of ideas floating
 
around and a lot of interesting problems that  I never even

a few words  in between to try to explain what  I got out of

sense.
 
I thought  I would start with a story that my father liked to
 
tell.  My father was born in 1867,  and he used to say this

I think we must  say that,  in the world of the arts,  it  is
 
time to stop talking about multiculturalism and be
  
multicultural.  We go on and on and on discussing it and we
 
don't  "be" it primarily because it  is  such hard work.  It
 
really is.  Being multi-cultural  is very difficult not because
 
of a lack of good intentions but because it  is hard to
 
understand other peoples,  and other peoples have a hard time
 
understanding us.
 
My brother in law was  in the Merchant Marine during World War

H.  S.  It  spelled SHIP when you looked at  it.  There it was!
 
SHIP!  The  little boy had copied it  from the sides of the
 
anchored freighters,  and he did it  just  fine.  He was making a
 
good solid Arab try at a cross-cultural experience,  using all
 
the  skills he knew  (working harder than Pete was at the time,
 
actually.)
 
And he was right -
-
 he could spell SHIP.  But because he was
 
going from right to left  instead of left to right,  he
 
couldn't build on what he thought he knew -
-
 he couldn't
 
spell PUSH for instance.  But he was working so hard.
 
That SHIP  comes  into my mind all the time when I am talking
 
with people from other cultures,  because  I always need to
 
remind myself deep inside that things  I think I understand
 
could be backwards.  I could be operating just the wrong way
 
around,  and so could the people who are trying so hard to get
 
together with me.
 
Now,  my dear friends,  when you really understand that,  when
 
you get that  into your heads permanently,  you are going to
 
drop this terrible metaphor we use -
-
 the model of the
 
grantor and the  supplicant,  the  lord and the peasant who is
 
coming in to get  funding.  You are not going to think that way
 
any more.  You are going to realize instead that you are
 
working with people conjointly on a problem connected with
 
art  into which you can put  in some money,  perhaps,  but they
 
have to put  in some things too.  It  is a reciprocal
 
relationship you have  set up there,  and I urge you to try it,
 
use  it as a model.
 
I was thinking yesterday that at this meeting we are actually
 
talking about philanthropy.  We are working within this
 
culture's philanthropic system and suddenly it hit me that we
 
are only talking in terms of our own.  We never talk about
 
anybody else's  system of philanthropy,  do we?
 
Peoples other than western Europeans also take care of their
 
educational systems and their health systems and their arts
 
too,  and so they have developed ways of doing all that.  But
 
we rarely think to bring those other ways  into the
 
discussion.  I know,  for example,  just  from visiting a little
 
bit,  that most American Indian tribes have a philanthropic
 
system that  is very reciprocal.  They have potlatches and
 
giveaways and,  when you give somebody something,  they are
 
obligated to give something back.  Now that puts a different
 
spin on how we should be giving money in the  Indian world,
 
doesn't  it? Maybe we are putting burdens on people.  Maybe
 
they want or need to accept those burdens,  but maybe the
 
discussion of the transaction ought to be different,  which is
 
what  I am suggesting here.  Maybe we ought to think  (though in
 
all honesty I have to point out to you that here comes
 
another "how"  instead of a "what")  about other systems that
 
might work differently.
 
But whether you are a Paul Bunyan or a Brer Rabbit,  I would
 
love to see you to take on a genuine problem or two,  not  just
 
an institution.  One of the  strongest advantages of the old
 
Folk and Traditional Arts Program was that our field was so
 
under-institutionalized we didn't have to spend most of our
 
energy working with institutional complexities.  Most of you
 
are  stuck with them,  but you can begin to reduce their heft a
 
bit.
 
Try thinking in terms  of problems  for a change.  How about
 
doing something to try to take care of the very real needs of
 
the performing arts? They need rehearsal  spaces,  they need
 
publicity materials,  they need all kinds of things right
 
across the board from New York to California.  And visual
 
artists need marketing know-how and supplies.  How about  some
 
kind of a cheap warehouse where people could order not-for-
profit-priced photographic materials,  or clay,  paint and
 
canvas?
 
There was once an old blind lady named Emma Dusenberry.  She
 
lived in Mena,  Arkansas and she was born blind and she  sang.
 
By the time any folklorist  found her,  she knew hundreds and
 
hundreds of songs all the way through.  She sat there with her
 
blind eyes  looking out at whatever she  saw in her head,  and
 
she was  just a river of song.  One time somebody asked her how
 
she came to know so many songs,  and she said,  "Well,  you know
 
when I was a little girl  I decided I was going to learn every
 
song in the world.  Every single one.  And so every song I
 
heard,  I learned it,  and I learned and I learned and that  is
 
how I know these songs." The folklorist  said to her,  "Well,
 
Mrs.  Dusenberry,  did you succeed in learning all the songs in
 
the world? Did you ever get there?" She said,  "No,  I had to
 
quit.  They kept on making up new ones."
 
I think that  is the beauty of the work we are involved in.
 
The artists and the troubles are out there enduring,  and they
 
keep on making up new ones  for us,  so we'll always have
 
something exciting to do and to get together about and to
 
join hands on and to have a wonderful time with.  So finish up
 
your meeting in great  spirits,  go home,  add just maybe one
 
what to your hows and maybe one problem to your institutional
 
list and remember what you' ve learned these  last three days.
 
And if you ever want to talk about  it all,  just call me on
 
the telephone.
