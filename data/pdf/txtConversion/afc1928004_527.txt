in te Office of the Librarian of Congress, a! Washinjton, 
Title and music composed.by PADDY MURPHY'. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea ; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country, it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle ! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile 
A 
fig for her foes, where-ever they may be ; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land. 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin. 
True Irish Gent. 
Words and music by PADDY M URPHY. 
Copyrighted and published by F. A. NORTH, Musk Publisher, 
Philadelphia Pa. 
It's a 
shame on the stage how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to me. 
How the gentry in front will stand such insults, 
And receive such block-heads with glee. 
But if they went to old Ireland they'd make their mistake, 
For our boys in style are well dressed, 
And in manners as well to you I'll now tell, 
Sure they stand in this land with the best. 
CHORUS. 
For singing and dancing, and all kinds of fun, 
And if ever to old Ireland you went, 
From their head to their toes they wear stylish clothes— 
I 
speak of a 
True Irish Gent. 
Some make up their face and look just like fools, 
And walk like a 
dog with three legs ; 
But if they went to old Ireland to show them such fun, 
They would pelt them with stones and bad eggs. 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen, too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope that we'll see that little isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue. 
Vor singing and dancing, &Cq

The Dear Old Flag of Green. 
Written for PADDY and ELLA M URPHY by BARNEY FAGAN. 
How proudly floats forth our noble flag of green— 
That emblem of purity— in solitude serene. 
With rapture and delight the Irish bosoms heave ; 
To earth its oppressors our martyrs yet will cleave 
No taint of dishonor at that banner ever hurled, 
Since first its proud foulds to the breeze were unfurled. 
May the bright suns of heaven cast their beams on that 
spot, 
And let a 
day of freedom be the Irishmen's lot. 
CHORUS. 
Then let your shouts re echo, far, far across the sea, 
All loyal sons stand ready to see that isle set free ; 
Quickly swell your ranks, and let your war cry be : 
Death to the tyrants ; on, on to victory ! 
With pride we can look on the noble deeds and fame 
Of Irelands trusty warriors—immortal be their names. 
Foremost in the strife amid the shot and shell, 
The glorious din of battle- cry our patriots help to swell 
Their praises resound throughout our noble land, 
On every battle field their deeds of bravery stand. 
With courage true as steel and eager for the fray, 
Right manfully they strive to help gain the day. 
Then let your shouts, & e. 
All honor to the heroes now lying ' neath the clay, 
The memory of their valiant deeds never shall decay. 
Unfurl to the breeze the flag they love so dear, 
Proclaim to its foes they'll yet have cause to fear. 
Loud above the din of the roaring cannon's peel, 
The steady tread of cavalry, the clanging of the steel, 
Will be heard the cry of victory, as it resounds from 
shore to shore, 
Old Ireland's sons will wake to find their bondage chains 
no more. 
Then let your shouts, &e. 
LOOK AT THE CLOCK, 
Sung by JENNIE ENGL. 
YOUNG ladies tarry, think e'er you marry, 
.1 lesson pray take from that I 
sing, 
For though black slaves are of course unknown here 
We wives you'll find are the slaws of the ring, 
Our husbands nightly, most unpolitely 
With their companions abroad will roam. 
Of us ne'er thinking, they go off drinking, 
While we are crying our eyes out at home. 
CHORUS. 
Think, think, how slowly the moments 
While you're enjoying your pipe and gl 
Think, think how slowly the moments pass, 
Now gentlemen pray mind what I 
say, 
And look, look at the clock. 
Now thus to leave us, and so deceive tit, 
I'm sure you'll own is a 
monstrous sin, 
For there's no knowing where you are going, 
Or what bad company you may get in, 
For when you tell, deceitful fellows, 
That at your club you have passed the night. 
At that casino you're often seen oh, 
You must acknowledge now that is not right, 
Think, think, & c. 
Then when returning we're soon discerning, 
That in your manner there's something que;T, 
You whisper S.a mon but that's all gammon, 
It's somethirg stronger than that I 
fear, 
It must be really, for when awaking, 
A 
noise you're making for a 
cup of tea, 
You didn't ought to want Soda water, 
Through eating Salmon you must agree, 
Think, think, a

I'll take my dud3 and tote 'em on my back when the Glendy

The sights way down at New Orleans I 
tell you are mighty 
rare, 
The steamboats along the levee are bound to make one stare, 
The engine rocks, the smoke goes up, the wheels turn round

I'll take my duds and tote 'em on my back when the Glendy 
Burk comes down.

Put your arms around me, Ida, 
Slumber sweetly on my breast, 
Let my bosom be a 
pillow 
For your little head to rest; 
Tell me if your heart is honest, 
Whisper that you will be true, 
And remember, Ida, darling, 
I 
am ever true to you.

Put your arms around me, Ida, 
Dream of future joy and bliss, 
Tell me if your heart is honest, 
Give me, darling, one sweet kiss. 
In your eye there's beauty, Ida, 
Virtucs,'s painted on your check, 
And your gentle voice and manner 
Tell me you are kind and meek; 
When you smile there's not an angel 
That can look as bright and fair, 
And none other, Ida darling, 
Has such lovely, silken hair. 
Put your arms around me, &c. 
When I 
first beheld thee, Ida, 
Tripping gaily o'er the lea, 
Then I 
said you were a 
jewel 
That would love and comfort me; 
Tell me if I've rightly guessed it, 
Do not think my words amiss, 
Say that you are mine forever. 
Give me, darling, one sweet kiss. 
Put your arms around me. &e.

Dear one, speak to me again, 
In those tones so pure and sweet, 
Angry words but give me pain, 
Make me sad whene'er we meet. 
Do not leave me now in scorn, 
Is my pure love all in vain ? 
Are those vows false that were sworn? 
Darling, love me once again. 
CHORUS. 
Dear one, speak to me again, 
In those tones so pure and sweet, 
Angry words but give me pain, 
Darling, speak to me again. 
Darling, in thy tender heart 
lbst some fond love still abide? 
-
1),nr, one, say not we must part, 
Let me zAill be near thy side. 
has it all been but a 
dream ? 
Say not yes, and give me pain ; 
Let some fond hope o'er me gleam, 
Darling, love me once again. 
Dear one, speak, &c. 
Dear one, do come back to me, 
Say, oh ! soy you'll love me still ; 
Then you'll my poor heart relieve, 
And my hopes of pleasure fill. 
Then will dark clouds pass away, 
Bearing with them all my pain, 
Night to me will then be day, 
Darling, love me once again. 
Dear one, speak. & c.

DAISY. 
'Words and Music by Wiar IL TRI3H3LE, 
Sung by him in his 
Mystic Changes. 
'Twas on one pleasant afternoon, 
in the merry month of May, 
I 
saw a 
pretty maiden, 
So beautiful and gay ; 
She was walking careless along, 
Viewing the sglits and scenes, 
Her face does hannt me in my thoughts, 
.:tlso in my dreams. 
Cuoaus. 
She's as pretty as a 
little butterfly, 
She's set this darkey crazy; 
I 
can't forget the day I 
met 
My pretty little Daisy. 
(Dance.) 
I 
met her soon after that, 
'Twas on a 
moonlight night,. 
I 
vowed to her my affection, 
My heart beat with delight; 
She smiled and said she loved me 
And said she'd be ray wiie, 
She is all the world to me, 
She's as dear to me as life. 
She's as pretty, etc-
The Breakneck Micks. 
Written by JonN G. 
SPARKS. 
Dedicated to BILLY ROBINSON, the only 
rival of SHEEHAN & JONES. 
We just come out before ye now, 
McKlink it is our name ; 
Our occupation is painting white vest., 
We arrived on the cattle train. 
We were with the circus fourteen nights, 
Doing tight-rope tricks, 
Just watch us now and we'll show you how 
To be two breakneck micks. 
CHORUS. 
Fall on your neck, walk on your eye, 
Do a 
ballet dance on lict bricks •, 
So pike us all and stag the gall 
Of the only breakneck micks, 
We throw a 
triple somersault 49 feet high, 
Wrestle with a 
lion in his cage ; 
We beat Signor Flyn and Mons. McGin 
Leaping through knives from the gallery to the 
stage. 
We were born in Hoboken, near the county Meath, 
Our heads are as sound as bricks, 
So when we are away we know you'll say, 
Five cheers for the breakneck micks. 
Fall on your neck, &c. 
A 
Hundred Years Ago. 
Written by CHARLES ARCHER, expressly for, and sung by, EDWIN BARRY 
with great success. 
The songs and poems ev'ry night, 
You hear upon the stage ; 
Some artists sing and some recite, 
Of every clime and age. 
So, if the favor you'll confer 
Attention to bestow ; 
I'd like to speak of the men that were, 
One hundred years ago. 
CHORUS. 
A 
hundred years 
A 
hundred years ago. 
I'd fain refer to the men that were 
One hundred years ago. 
Sweet Erin's famous to this day 
For whiskey, love and mirth ; 
'Tis the home of hospitality, 
That gave St. Patrick birth. 
The home of Robert Emmet true 
And O'Connell, well, we know, 
That Irish patriots wern't so few 
A 
hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, & c. 
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. 
Continued. 
Old England had her heroes brave, 
Whose names shall ever stand, 
With gallant Nelson on the wave, 
Lord Wellington on land. 
And France can boast Napoleon, too, 
Cambrou with hair like snow, 
And Ney who fought at Waterloo, 
Near a 
hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, &c. 
America should ne'er forget 
The men she held so dear ; 
Thank God I 
their names are living yet, 
And will for many a 
year. 
Mad Anthony Wayne, and General Lee, 
The terror of the foe ; 
General Washington, none great as he, 
One hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, &c. 
The trials of that gallant band, 
I 
need not stop to tell; 
They struggled hard, they freed the land, 
And the flag we love so well. 
The stars and stripes shall ever wave, 
Nor ever be laid low; 
While we've men as true, and hearts as brave, 
As one hundred years ago. 
A 
hundred years ago, &c, 
OLD MAN.—FOR sixty years together we've been, 
And never a 
day of sorrow seen, 
We're always as you see us. 
Merry, full of glee; 
OLD Wom's.—Through life we've had the up and down: 
Ill hick met without a 
frown, 
Our sorrows we would always drown. 
With cheer and jollity. 
CHORUS. 
Don't let troubles come too fast, 
If you wish to make life last, 
Look upon the bright side, 
You'll find it the better plan. 
When we were young and in our prhne, 
We used to like to have a 
good time, 
And even now, we're not behind, 
The young folks at their play. 
We like to see each one enjoy, 
The time allotted girl or boy, 
But pray you don't your live's destroy, 
For soon we're called away. 
Don't let troubles, xt. 
Written and sung by JOHN W HITNEY, of the W HITNEY'S, with great 
success in their character sketch, '" Rehearsal in the Parlor." 
Oh, here I 
am, an Irish man, 
As you can plainly see, 
I 
have to work from morn till night 
To support my family. 
I 
left my dear old native land, 
Oh, yes, that dear ould sod, 
And its here I 
am in America, 
Carrying the hod. 
Cnonus. 
Oh, its mortar and bricks 
I 
have to carry fr,:m morn till night, oh, 
NO 
sooner than I 
mi to the top, 
Than then I'm down below. 
My friends fir. y 
knoI.- both near and far, 
No matter where I 
trod, 
That there's not a 
man in this whole wide wm-id 
Can bate me carrying the hod. 
At night when I 
am through my work, 
Right to my home I 
go, 
My wife she meets me with a 
smile, 
My children do also, 
It's take a 
chair and do sit down 
And rest yourself dear dad, 
For we know your tired and worn out, 
From carrying the hod.

Edwin Barry's " Whoa, Emma!" 
Written by T. S. LONSDALE, and sung by EDWIN BARRY. 
Some folks call me a 
Laundress ; 
Soap- suds, Old Starch mid Blue, 
Because I'm a 
Good Templar— 
And take in washing, too ; 
They all may call me names like that— 
Or anything they choose, 
If they will only stop my wife 
From going on a " booze." 
SPOKEN—But that is quite impossible, I'm afraid—she has 
a 
kind and indulgent husband—and all he says to her is— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Emma ! Whoa, Emma ! 
Emma, this will never do ! 
Whoa, Emma! Oh, Emma! 
Emma, I'm ashamed of' you. 
One time she was quite temperate, 
Just sip a 
glass of wine, 
Whenever we had friends around 
At good old Christmas time. 
But now she drinks just like a 
fish, 
(In fact just like a 
whale). 
If you should ask her what she'll take, 
SPOKEN— She'll reply, " I 
don't mind; anything will do--, 
just— 
A small drop in a 
pail." 
EDWIN BARRY'S " WHOA, EMMA !" 
Continued. 
SPOKEN— I 
would let her swim in it at home—but when 
she goes out in the street, and lies down in the road-
17 
Oh, Emma ! & c. 
Each morning she is up by six, 
And flies off to the " Pub," 
Before she does a 
stroke of work, 
Or gives the clothes a 
rub. 
When she returns, of course I'm up, 
And all our children straight, 
But she is always out again 
Before the clock strikes eight, 
SPOKEN—To 
have another half pint ; and when she returns 
I, like a 
fond and affectionate husband, say— 
Oh, Enima ! & c, 
Our business it will go to smash 
If she don't turn me up, 
I'll keep no home or laundry, 
But drink the " bitter cup," 
And go and sell the furniture, 
While I've the privilege, 
And with the coin I'll have a 
day, 
Likewise I'll break the pledge. 
SPOKEN—I'll get gloriously inebriated myself and join the 
old lady, and as we go along arm in arm, we can both say— 
Oh Emma!

MRS. MURPHY'S SLEIGHING PARTY. 
: Dame Durden. 
AssungbyToNy P AST OR. 
Entered according to the Act of Congress, in the year 1s74, by A. J. 
FISITElt, in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 
MRS. MURPHY kept a 
grocery store, upon the boulevard, 
And one night for myself and friemls, a 
great feast she 
prepared, 
I 
never shall forget that time, it was a 
wintry night. 
When we engaged that four- horse sleigh, Rnd started with 
delight. 
SPOKEN.—Yes! we all arranged to have a 
jolly time, 
Mrs. Murphy supplied the hash, awl we found the whisky. 
So I 
went among my acquaintances to make up the party. 
And a 
finer lot of boys and girls never started on a 
trip to-
gether, such hugging anq loving as there was in that sleigh, 
I 
can scarcely describe. These are the names of the crowd. 
CHORUS. 
There was Sam and Mick, and Pat and Dick, and Bill, with 
the carroty hair, 
There was Sue and Sal, and Bridget and Nell and Lucy, so 
pretty and fair, 
First Sam kissed Sal, then Dick kissed Nell, 
And Bill with the carroty hair, kissed Lucy so pretty and 
fair, 
But I 
with Kitty, the charming girl, of hugging I 
took my 
share. 
We started in the greatest glee, a 
merry laughing party, 
We kissed and joked, and joked and kissed, and sung with 
voices loud, 
Till just beyond the Central Park, we overboard did go, 
Our drunken driver for a 
lark, he pitched us in the snow. 
19 
SPOKEN. --And of all the screeching that ever you heard, 
our gals beat it by chalks. 
It seem'd as if by mutual con-
sent, all the men folks went into the snow- drift, and the 
gals after them. 
Sally Cassidy made a 
tenstrike with her 
bustle on Sam Jones' nose, while Sue Snyder stuck fast in 
the bank wrong side up, doing the manual exercise with 
her garters. 
Mickey Kelly and Lucy Jones got tied to-
gether in a 
sailor's slip knot, it took , us ten minutes to un-
ravel them. 
As for me, I 
struck Sally Smith so hard with 
my corporosity, I 
drove her down intothe drift like a 
spile 
and we thought for some time, she'd have to lay there 
till spring and get thawed out, 
But at last we got fixed all 
right again for another start, and off we went, both 
Sam and Nick, & c. 
To Mrs. Murphy's house we got, and straightway all went 
We eat her hash and fish-balls up, we drank her beer and 
gill, 
In fact a 
jollier crowd, was never seen before, 
Than we, when starting to go home, from Mrs. Murphy's 
door, 
SPokEs.—Yes, you can bet your stamps there wasn't a 
gal 
or fellow belonging to that party, but was fifty above proof. 
We got " spilled out of the sleigh two-by- two. 
Sam fell 
into Florence's water trough; -while Sue spent the night in a 
frog pond, singing Home Sweet Home. Dick was found 
in the middle ,• f 
Harlem Lane, trying to strangle himself 
with Bridget Delany's pompadour. 
Nick got entangled 
in Lucy's hoop-skirts, and as for myself and Kitty, we shall 
never forget the time, when we went sleighing 
With Sam and Nick, &c.

THE MURPHY TWINS. 
21 
Wten by JOHN SHEEHAN, and sung by the famous guEEnAx 
.t JONES in their original sketch entitled " The Arrival 
of the Murphys." 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We just arrived this morning, 
At the Castle Garden pier; 
We are looking out for Mulberry Street, 
Where lives our brother Pan, 
lie is an American citizen, 
Likewise an alderman. 
Ci 10IZUS. 
We are the Murphy twins, 
From the County of Kildare, 
We have just arrived this morning, 
At Castle Garden pier; 
We crossed the stormy ocean, 
To become American citizens, 
Where could you find an Irish pair 
Could beat the Murphy twins. 
The morning we left Kildare, 
Our mother she did say— 
Hold up your heads me children, 
For you are going to America; 
You may become aristocrats, 
Or Democrats, you know, 
But don't forget old Ireland, 
Wherever you may go. 
We are, ete. 
Murphy's Dream. 
Written by GEORGE Mtmrny, and performed by GEORGE and Joni\ 
M URPHY. 
George and John Murphy stayed out a 
whole night, 
Arid the truth is they drank too much beer, 
And when they got home they both were so tight, 
That both of their heads felt quite queer. 
' 
Let's sit down and rest ourselves," George said to John ; 
" 
Let's try and recollect where we've been ;" 
So they sat down, but, oh, in a 
minute or two, 
They were asleep and beginning to dream. 
Now dreaming is funny—your mind wanders away— 
Some dream they are a 
king, some a 
goat, 
Why, I 
dreamt Cother night, peculiar to say, 
I 
was an engine on the elevated railroad. 
But the Murphys they dreamed that in Paris they were, 
Looking for a 
first-class hotel, 
In their valises was gold, but how it got there 
Neither of the Murphys could tell. 
They dreamt George was a Dutchman, and that his name 
was Jake, 
With his clothes tore, and bald-headed at that, 
That John was an Irishman, and from jail he did break, 
That his name wasn't John, but was Pat ; 
Among lunatics surely they thought that they were, 
Who they tried to kill, strange it did seem ; 
That they were arrested and caught in a 
snare, 
This the Murphys all saw in, their dream. 
They dreamt to the gallows they both had to go, as their 
sentence was they had to die ; 
That they mounted the scaffold, John quickly, George slow, 
and that neither attempted to cry. 
They dreamt that hanging them wasn't severe, 
But imagined that it would cause lots of fun ; 
That the soldiers and sheriffs all stood quite near, 
To make sure that the murderers were hung ; 
They dreamt that the trap fell and that they were dead, how 
strange the sensation did seem, 
But the truth was the beer had got into their heads and 
caused such a

M AXWELL. 
WHEN only a 
year in this country, 
And a 
month in this wonderful town ; 
Strange things I 
have seen and stranger things heard 
Which to me appeared queer I 
must own; 
I 
don't want you to think I'm perfection, 
Nor I 
wouldn't be indeed if I 
could, 
Yet whenever I 
go among the rich or the poor, 
Th re is some one to say I 
am no good. 
Cnorms. 
Poi the boys in the street they cry out 
In a 
way can't be misunderstood; 
Will you ever go home to old Ireland; 
Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
When first I 
arrived in the city, 
lo a 
first-class hotel sure I 
went; 
Straight up Broadway I 
rAnbled, 
To view all the sights I 
was bent; 
Into a 
neat little gin-mill I 
wandered, 
Like a 
r. al Irish gentle an should; 
Whe the puppy that sto 
behind the bar, 
Says you can't hang me up, you're no good. 
For the Boys, At, 
Says I 
do I 
look .ike a 
hangman,: 
Or any of that rascally crowd; 
Who in Ireland for less than a 
shillin-r, 
To take a 
man's lif would be proud 
No, indeed, now my friend, you don't know mg, 
Thougbpoor I 
might be and need food, 
Yet there is not a 
man in the country, 
I3egorra could say I 
am no good 
For the Boys, &c. 
When at home I 
was a 
bit of a 
boxer, 
And could hold my own with the rest, 
And in many an off hand encounter, 
I 
was known to have come out the best; 
Yet I 
hardly reached Castle Garden, 
Scarcely knew, be dad, where I 
stocd, 
When a 
shaver shot up to my shoulder, 
says Murphy, lay down, you're no good. 
For the Boys, ch. 
This saying at first did surprise me, 
But now I 
am used to it all, 
And along with the rest of the gang, 
I 
can daily be seen at the hall; 
Now when the poor and the sick need assistance, 
By you all it is well understood, 
There is not a 
man in the ward 
Will say Murphy, lay down you're no good. 
For the boys in the street, they all shout. 
In a 
voice can't be misunderstood, 
There goes Mr. Murphy the solid man, 
Dare any of you say he's no gcod.

ONE in this bright world to me is fair, 
Voice like an angel and dark flowing hair. 
Sweetly does life give moments of bliss, 
Sealing our love with an angelic kiss. 
Swiftly the moments are passing away, 
Quickly the dawn of life is turning gray; 
But every moment, as life is growing old, 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
Cnottus. 
Better than gold with sweet thoughts I 
love thee, 
Nothing can ever unfold, 
Better than gold with feelings untold ;-
Darling, I 
love you far better than gold. 
When your dark eyes are beaming in mine, 
Firing my heart like the nectar of wine, 
Thou art ever the same unto me, 
Filling my bosom with love's ecstacy, 
Wafting my soul to the realms of the blest, 
Passing and leaving love's wild unrest; 
Then if you love me why treat me so cold? 
Whom my heart praises far better than gold. 
Better than gold. etc. 
Would you still love, through trouble and woe ? 
Follow my footsteps wherever I 
go? 
Ever to thee my poor heart will cling, 
Loving and trusting whatever may bring. 
Let ill betide or lay at thy door, 
Still I 
will love thee the same eve.rmore. 
All the sweet secrets my heart can unfold 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
Better than gold, etc.

Beckey Gildersleeve. 
Written by CHAS. SANDERS. Sung by GRAHAM & JONES with great success. 
Sweet was the girl I 
met last Sunday 
While walking through the park to take the evening air, 
She smiled when I 
passed her, 
My heart went with her, 
I 
knew that I 
had won 
This little Deitcher girl so fair, 
Oh, she sent me a 
note 
On which was wrote— 
Her name was I3eckey Gildersleeve, 
Her fader he was rich, 
IIer mutter keeps a 
bier serloon 
Behind McCoomb's Ditch, 
I 
am going to meet this German girl 
Next Sunday afternoon, 
I'll treat her to a 
dozen bier's, 
And catch her very soon. - 
(Break.) 
(Break.) 
I'll put on me Sunday clothes 
And won't I 
look gallus, 
With my swallow- tail coat, 
Double-breasted in the back, 
I'll pay five cents on the steam locomotive 
And to her house I'll ride on the railroad track ; 
I 
expect there will be a band, ( Break.) 
At the depot when I 
land. 
To escort me to my Beckey's house, 
Und then her folks will see, 
Or else a 
half a 
dozen clubs 
Be waiting there for me. 
And if I 
don't get her consent, 
I 
know I 
turn a 
loon, 
And cut my throat with a 
bar of soap; 
That will end me very soon.

It's of this little dear I 
will tell you, 
With a 
dashing style that is very rare. 
'You should ee her for she is bewitching, 
When she is dressed up in her suit of light blue, 
And looking up says "now, ain't I 
pretty ?" 
Tell me sweetness, oh ! tell me, ain't it true?" 
CHORUS. 
When she stands before her mirror, 
And I 
her try to please, 
Then I'll tell her that I 
love her, 
And then she'll coax and tease, 
Then she'll look up with a 
smile, she's so witty ! 
If you love me, -MI me, ain't your darling pretty." 
The other morning we went out walking, 
And took a 
promenade upon the green, 
And I 
only wish you could have seen us, 
Such a 
gay sight never before was seen. 
I 
tell you the lads they all me envy, 
And I 
so very unconcerned do seem, 
Yes, I 
think I 
heard " oh ! ain't she pretty?" 
A 
dozen times upon that vilage green. 
Chortm, 
But still these happy days are passing, 
And soon will be the day she'll be my bride, 
Oh! how dear I 
love the little darling, 
As through the future happy years we'll glide. 
To see her you'd envy and not pity, 
For all my cherished hopes I've centered there, 
The first thing you'd say " oh! ain't she pretty," 
With her flowing locks of bright golden hair.

The Careful Man. 
Written, composed, and sung with immense success by HARRY M ON' 
TAGUE, the " Artist Comique." 
There was a 
man who boasted that from trouble he could 
keep ; 
He always followed out the motto—" Look before you leap ;" 
Ile took such strong precautions that the people soon began 
To own there nciver v.- as, cr could be, such a 
careful man. 
CHORUS. 
He was a 
careful man, he WarS a 
careful man ; 
Where'er he went ' twas his intent 
To be a 
careful. man. 
In June he wore an overcoat, to guard against the storm, 
And left it off in winter, in case it should turn warm. 
He never rode in coach or cab, for fear the horses kicked ; 
He always sewed his pockets up to sop their being picked. 
lieNvai a 
careful man, &c. 
He always eat quite sparingly, for fear that he'd get stout, 
And had his bed made on the floor, for fear that he'd fall out; 
He never knew the time of day—it may appear a 
silly thing— 
And he never would wind up his watch, in case he'd break 
the spring. 
He was a 
careful man, &c. 
You'd never see him smoke at all, neither day nor night, 
For fear while puffing his cigar he set himself alight ; 
fie never goes to balls or parties anywhere in town, 
Because one night by chance he slipped and pulled his part-
per down. 
He rarely lived in one place long—his nature was to roam— 
At last 1, went to Brooklyn, and has since made that his 
home ; 
He joined a 
local vestry, which pleased his friends so much 
They soon induced him to become the parson of their church. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
Ile preached on every topic, and it was his constant aim 
To astonish his congregation and earn himself a 
name. 
Now, not long since he thought he'd go and see New York 
by night, 
So he took two detectives along with him to show him all the 
sights. 
He was a 
careful man, & c. 
He saw so much of loveliness, and of beauty frail but fair, 
And a 
handsome young creature made love to him—a 
blonde 
with golden hair •, 
But for fear that he'd be led astray he went down upon his 
knees 
Beside this lovely damsel, and—began to say his prayers ! 
For Ile was a 
careful man, & c.

Paddle Your Boat Along. 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
This world we live in is just like the sea, 
Travelers over its waters are we ; 
Try to be lappy where'er you may be, 
if the wind should blow steady and strong. 
It's no use to grumble, to growl or complain, 
You can't stop the wind nor you can't stop the rain, 
After a 
storm we have sunshine again— 
So paddle your boat along. 
CHORUS. 
Always try to be happy and gay, 
Let this world jog on as it may; 
Always do right and never do wrong, 
As you paddle your boat along. 
There are people we meet who always seem glad, 
Others who always seem solemn and sad. 
They want all the good but won't share the bad ; 
Now I 
think that decidedly wrong. 
There are good things enough in this world for us all, 
If we be content with a 
share of the small, 
Tho' little our lot, some have nothing at all, 
So paddle your own boat along. 
Always try to be happy, & c. 
Don't be down-hearted, though breakers may roar, 
Or if your boat be cast on the shore ; 
You are sure to get into smooth water once more 
If you pull steady and strong. 
Don't pull too slow nor yet pull too fast, 
But always make way for a 
friend to get past. 
The harbor of safety you'll reach well at last, 
If you paddle your boat along. 
Always try to be happy, & c. 
Allow me to See you Homo. 
Sung by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comique, New York. 
They say I'm a 
desperate flirt, 
A gay and a 
festive young man ; 
I 
admit it and boldly assert 
I 
will have all the pleasure I 
can.
 •, 
I 
admire pretty faces and feet, 
And whenever chance leads me to roam, 
If a 
sweet pretty girl I 
should meet, 
I 
insist upon seeing her home. 
CHORUS. 
Allow me to see you home, 
That is if I 
don't intrude, 
No matter how far, so pretty you are, 
I 
hope you'll not think that I'm rude : 
Oh do let me see you home 
You sweet little scrumcious maid, 
You've nothing to fear you sweet little dear, 
Come along and don't be afraid. 
Sometimes the fair creatures say " yes r 
And often decidedly " no ;" 
'Tis then I 
endeavor to press, 
Until they allow me to go; 
Then I 
secretly wonder how far, 
Sometimes it's a 
duced long way. 
I 
then think what fools we men are ! 
But still I 
continue to say 
Allow me to see you home, &c. 
One night I 
was had for a 
mark 
And felt just a 
little bit small, 
'Twas a 
girl that I 
met in the Park, 
A 
beautiful figure so tall ; 
She allowed me to stand her champagne, 
And pay for a 
cab to her door, 
Then advised me to run home again 
As she did'nt want anything more. 
SPOKEN.—Pretty thing to tell a 
fellow after standing supper, 
paying cab fare eight and a 
half miles ; told me to run home 
again ; bounced in and shut the door in my face. 
I 
declared 
that should be the last girl I 
should see home, but I 
scarcely 
got twenty yards from the house when I 
met another fair 
creature. 
I 
said " Ahem, rather late to be alone, miss." 
No answer, so I raised my hat and said, " I 
beg pardon miss 
Allow me to see you home, & c. 
Always Speak a 
Kind Word when you Can, 
35 
Sung by E DWIN BARRY, at Harrigan & Hart's Theatre Comiquc, amid 
roars of applause. 
Strange sayings are the rage, on the street and on the stage, 
And many glorious maxims you will find •, 
But there's one more than the rest 
Seems to linger in my breast, And very oft comes stealing 
o'ermy mind ; 
sing a 
song to- night of a 
motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand, 
To the beggar at your door, or to anyone that's poor, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Now there's many a 
man, who great riches does command, 
But his praises and his honors they are small ; 
But when he's dead and gone, they will speak of him and 
mourn, 
And say how good that he has been to all. 
And while upon this earth, struggling hard through life, 
No one would assist him in his plans ; 
But the stories they relate_ when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind word when they can, 
The workingman to-day with his poor and scanty pay, 
Striving very hard his family to maintain ; 
While the rich they stay at home with the riches that they own, 
The poor may ask assistance all in vain. 
When humble is your lot in the wretched laborer's cot, 
Don't pass them by, but take them by the hand, 
Don't turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can.

THE BEAUTIFUL SNOW, 
The author found at last—Ann Rvx.4.-s's moruEn 
OH! the snow, the beautiful snow, 
Filling the sky and the earth below; 
Over the house-tops, over the streets, 
Over the heads of the people you meet, 
Dancing, flirting, skimming along. 
Beautiful snow, it can do nothing wrong, 
Flying to kiss a 
fair lady's cheek; 
Clinging- to lips in a 
frolicsome freak, 
Beautiful snow from heaven above. 
Pure as an angel, gentle as love. 
Oh ! the snow, the beautiful snow, 
Ilow the flakes gather and laugh as they go, 
Whirling about in their maddening fun, 
It plays in its glee w;th every one— 
Chasing, hughing, hurrying by. 
It lights on the lice and it sparkles the eye. 
And the dogs with a 
bark and a 
bound, 
Snap at the crystals that eddy around; 
The town is alive and its heart in a,dow, 
To welcome the coining of the beautiful snow, 
how wildly the crowd goes swaying along 
liaili 
each other with humor and song; 
How the gay sledges like meteors flash by, 
Bright for 
moment, then lost to the eye ! 
Ringing, swinging, dashing they gs. 
Over the crust of the beautiful snow— 
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky, 
As to make one regret to see it lie, 
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of t_ 
Till it blends w,th the filth in the horrible street. 
Once was as pure as the sno 
but 
fell; 
Fell like the snow- flakes from ' leaven to hell, 
Fel to be trampled as lilt 
2a the street, 
Fell to be scoffed, tc be spit on and beat, 
i,FirOn!f, dreading to die, 
37 
So:.fl ng my ,- oul to whoever would buy, 
Dealing in shame for a 
morsel of bread, 
Haling- the living and fearing the dead, 
Merciful Goa I 
have I 
fallen so low ? 
And yeti was once like the beautiful snow! 
awe I 
was as fair as the beautiful snow, 
With an eye like a 
crystal a 
heart like its glow; 
Once I 
was loved for my innocent grace— 
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face. 
Father, mother, sister, all. 
God and myself I 
have lost by my fall, 
Th veriest wretch that goes shivering by, 
Will mmke a 
wide sweep lest I 
wander too nigh; 
For all that is on or above me I 
know, 
There's nothing as pure as the beautiful snow. 
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow, 
Should fall on a 
sinner with nowhere to go ; 
lok strange should it be when night comes again. 
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain. 
Fainting, freezing, dying alone. 
Too weak for prayer, too weak for a 
moan, 
To be heard in the streets of the c 
azy own; 
Gone mad in the joy of the snow co,ing down; 
To be and to die in my terrible woe, 
With a 
bed and a 
shroud of the beautiful snow. 
Helpless and foul as the trampled snosv, 
Sinner, clespa]r not ; Christ stoopedi low 
To rescue the soul that is lost in its sin, 
Lind raise it to life and enjoyment again, 
Groaning. bleeding, dying for thee 
The Crucified HUng, on the accursed tree, 
His accents of mercy felt soft on thine ear— 
ls there mercy for me ? will he heed my prayer? 
Oh God ! in the stream that for 2.tiners ( lid flow, 
Wash me, ad I 
shall be whiter than the beautiful snow.

Grandmother's Chair.

Copyrighted. 
My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, she had left a 
hundred pounds, 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
But when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm-chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You can then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life. 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I

I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair.

One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair?

See that my Grave is Whitewashed 
Every Summer. 
Written by JAS. McAvov expressly for the SPARKS BROTHERS, and sung 
..by them with tremendous success, 
When I've cashed in my checks, little Rosebud, 
When I 
am six foot under the turf, 
I 
forgive you, but you played me for a 
gilly, 
You worked me for every nickel I 
was worth. 
Oh, you said I 
could look, but mustn't touch, 
And you put me in such a 
dilemma; 
But there 13 one little snap I 
want to fake up between us— 
That is, see that my grave is whitewashed every summer. 
CHORUS. 
071, the days will come to your poison face. 
Think of how you backcapped me when I 
was living. 
Clean the snow off, when I'm planted, with a 
shovel, 
darling, 
And decorate my grave with turkeys' breasts, Thanks-
giving. 
Don't get cranky when I 
ask you to remember, 
When you used to give me taffy on the stick, 
And with your funny gags you paralyzed me— 
But, my darling, you can't say I 
ever kicked. 
I 
will meet you in the happy land of Canaan, 
Tra-la-lee, skip the sewer, for you are my baby; 
Plant huckleberry trees in the next lot to where I'm 
planted, darling, 
And see that my grave is kept shady. 
Oh the days will come, &c.

Oh my heart is gone but my gall remains, 
A 
charming girl went through me; 
She took my cash, for I 
was too fresh, 
And she gave me a 
terrible skin. 
I 
was on the booze, I 
lay down to snooze 
The first time she beheld me, 
And she worked the fake, for the graft was great, 
And I 
seen her in my dreams. 
When she went through me; 
And she knew me! 
She worked me for my wealth. 
And didn't leave a 
nickel! 
She surprised me ! (Sym.) 
She paralyzed me! ( Sym.)

Forget the day she worked me. 
I

I'm just as fresh as she. ( Dance) 
Oh that poison face got me off my base, 
And she played me for a 
gilly; 
And said I 
was no good, and my name was mud, 
Tra-la-lee, George, look for work, 
Then I 
pulled a 
pop and she took a 
drop, 
Then she did not seem so giddy. 
She winked her eye and gave me the guy, 
And she tickled me under the chin. 
She's as handsome (Sym.) 
As a 
handcart ! (Sym.) 
With her head stuck in an ash barrel— 
Picking cinders! (Sym.) 
She's a daisy ! ( Sym.) 
She's terrible lazy ! (Sym.)

Oh, my wife will talk of the wedding now, 
And the days when wc were young, 
For she's just as well, she'll often vow 
As when the bells were rung, 
She loves to sing. for she knows the ring 
Of her voice is sweet to me, 
And I

Kind friends, if you will listen, 
A 
song to you I 
will sing, 
it's of that great country, 
Where my father was king. 
It's of dear old Ireland, 
Where the shamrock grows green, 
And the boys and the girls, sure, 
Are the bravest ever seen. 
Cllonus. 
For I'm singing and dancing 
From morning ' till night, 
I'm a 
gay Irish lad, 
And full of delight. 
The girls, the dear creatures, 
Do all of them swear 
They're in love with Prince Patriek.0 
The pride of Kildare. 
You've heard of my fathers, 
In days that are passed, 
Were famous for fighting, 
And never were surpassed. 
And I'm their descendant, 
And this you'll agree, 
For a 
true Irish prince, 
Plaise behold one in inc. 
Composed and sung only by Tom HARPER, the only ouc-legged song 
and dance artist. 
I 
was born in America, where the fields of cotton grow, 
And the suo-ar cane, the sweetest in the land, 
Where the girls are always good, and the boys are true and 
brave, 
And \lien I 
meet them I 
feel grand. 
I 
have traveled o'er the hind, 
Many times my heart's been sad, 
But I've tried to make the most 
Of the good old times I've had. 
But the years are going fast, 
And I 
couldn't longer roam, 
And so you see Tom Harper's 
Come back home.

Now, I 
have been to Ireland, where the shamrock 
green, 
And they gave to me a 
welcome hand, 
For they love America, does tile gem of the sea, 
The reception that they gave me, it was grand. 
Then I 
went to Germany, likewise to sunny France, 
And how they all did shout when they saw me sing and 
dance, 
But, with all theirkindnes there I 
couldn't longer roam, 
And so you see Tont Harper's come back home.

Last night I 
was out rather late - 
"r was only an innocent spree— 
My wife for my coming did wait, 
When sleeping I 
thought she would be ; 
I 
found her in temper and tears; 
" 
Oh," she cried, " it's a 
sin and a 
shame!" 
And she scratched both my eyes and my cars; 
But I 
told her I 
soon would explain. 
Cnonus.--The " Club " had a 
meeting to-night, love, 
Of bus'ness we had a 
great sight love; 
Don't think for a 
moment I'm tight, love, 
l've only been down to the " Club." 
My boots I 
left down in the hall, 
And softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark— 
Cuonus.—The " Club" hind, etc. 
She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
Ana said she'd go back to her Ma; 
While I 
on the mantel-piece leaned, 
And tried to enjoy my cigar. 
I 
promised to buy her a 
dress 
If she 'd 
let me alone for awhile ; 
Then I 
gave her a 
sweet little kiss, 
And I 
saw her beginning to smile.

thought it a 
favorable opportunity to 
!.ssure her once more, as a 
positive fact, that—

Before ye stands an Irishman 
Troubled with enlargement of the gall, 
Sure I 
was four days in America, 
Boys, when I 
joined in Tammany Hall. 
And they put me up for Senator 
Against a 
man named Terry Hughes, 
I 
broke his heart—I 
carried the ward— 
I 
got the votes of all the Irish Jews. 
CHORUS. 
For I 
am Senator Michael Duffy from Sligo, 
I 
am a 
gentleman of talent and fame, 
And for to make a 
political speech all the Senators I 
can teach, 
Oh, for Senator Michael Duffy has got the brain.

I'll Bet You a 
Dol'ar You Don't, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY. 
Does any one know what I'm going to say ? 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
If I 
lose the wager, will any one pay, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Gay bachelors say they shall never take wives, 
For as each in his way to be happy contrives, 
They mean to keep single the rest of their lives. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
Find an Irish election without any row, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't, 
Or a 
sin l 
who objects to a 
mistletoe bough, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some years of experience teaches me this— 
That from seven to ninety both Mrs. and Miss 
May refuse you this ancient excuse for a 
kiss. 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar they don't. 
You may see vaccination a 
thing of the past, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
And heavy taxation abolished at last, 
I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
You may see old John Bull dwindle down to a 
calf, 
And his provender nothing but foreigners' chaff. 
You may see all the ladies too quiet by half, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar you don't. 
Some ignorant croakers wear visages long, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
And say that to visit amusement is wrong, 
. 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't ? 
Though to succor distress they can never afford, 
Above human vices they always have soared, 
Still somehow they know every move on the board, 
Will you bet me a 
dollar they don't? 
A 
married man often tries to prove cock- o'- the-walk, 
But I'll bet you a 
dollar he don't. 
If he tries to sleep when his wife wants to talk, 
I 
shall bet him two dollars he don't. 
So all you young girls, please attend to this verse, 
And go and get married for better or worse, 
And two little armfuls you may have to nurse, 
Won't bet a 
dollar you don't.

One summer's night ten years ago, 
The gang and brother Jim, 
Brought me down to the dock you know, 
'to learn me how to swim. 
They tied a 
rope around my waist, 
And then they heaved me in, 
To tell the truth, I 
was nearly drowned, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Swim out says Pete, arrah kick your feet, 
Go over-hand says brother Jim, 
The gang did shout as they dragged me out, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
Oh I " chaw roast-beef, the beef is tough," 
The gang sung out to me; 
They daubed my face with lumps of tar, 
I 
looked like a 
Chinee. 
I 
made back- dives and somersaults, 
Along with Shorty Tim ; 
Both my feet were cut with copper nails, 
The night I 
learned to swim. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
was chock full of salt water, 
Brought to a 
liquor store, 
There they rolled me on a 
barrel, 
For two long hours or more. 
Sure they made me drink some brandy, 
I 
had the jim-jam-jams, 
ne'er forget, as long as I 
live, 
The night I 
learned to swim.

I'll walk the first hundred miles on my head, 
The second on my toes; 
The third I'll walk on my eye-brows,

The fifth and last I'll walk on my ear, 
Then the Atlantic I 
walk across, 
Sure the Philadelphia Bladder says, 
Of all walkers I

I 
can walk from here to Australia and back 
In about three days and a

Or around the world in a

When Grandmama is Gone. 
Sung by Miss IDA BRUNIMELL. 
In her old arm chair she's sitting, 
As in years of long ago; 
She is knitting, knitting, knitting, 
Gently rocking to and fro, 
And a 
darkened thought steals o'er me, 
Like the shadows on the lawn, 
Of the lonely days before me 
After grandmama is gone. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! when grandmama is gone, 
When grandmama is gone, 
And her prayers and tears and toils for us are o'er : 
Who will cheer us day by day 
All along our pilgrim way, 
To the beautiful, the ever shining shore, 
Years ago a 
dear companion 
Promised her, a 
blushing bride, 
To protect, to love and cherish, 
E'en till death should them divide. 
O'er a 
low mound ' neath the willow, 
Summer roses long have blown ; 
They will blow above another 
After grandma= is gone. 
Neith the hill the sun is sitting, 
And the twilight shadows come ; 
Still she's waiting, waiting, waiting, 
Till her AlaAer calls her home ; 
And I 
weep for friends departing, 
While they're going one by one; 
I 
shall have one more in heaven 
After o-rand,nama is gone.

Man, Know Thyself. 
Sung by HARRY BECKWITH. 
Let each man learn to know himself, 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his neighbor; 
How lenient our own faults we view, 
And conscience voice adaptly smother, 
But oh how harshly we review 
The self same errors in another. 
CHORUS. 
Let each man learn to know himself, 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his neighbor. 
And when you meet an erring one 
Whose deeds are blameable or thoughtless, 
Consider, ere you cast tie stone, 
If you yourself be pure and faultless. 
Or list to that small voice within, 
Whose whisp'ring,s oft make men confounded, 
And trumpet not another's sin, 
You'd blush deep if your own were sounded. 
Let each man, &c. 
Or in self-judgment, if you find 
Your deeds to others are superior, 
To you has Providence been kind, 
As you should be to those inferior. 
Example sheds a 
genial ray 
Of light that men are apt to borrow, 
So first improve yourself to-day, 
And then improve your friends to-morrow

Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
If you've been vaccinated, take a 
walk with me to-night, 
I'll show you where the niggers and the Irish had a 
fight. 
You see old nigger Johnson hit McCarthy with a 
rock, 
Because McCarthy's kids were singing " Niggers on our block." 
The Fagans slugged he Johnsons, and the Johnson's they 
slugged back, 
And razors and shillalies were used by white and black. 
The '.. lood flowed free as water, and it looked just like a 
dock 
Where they whipped the gang of niggers, who were living on 
our block. 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Dusenbury crying with the croup, 
Trying to pick her teeth with a 
brown stone stoop, 
Rise, Sally Bounce, wipe your eyes out with a 
rock, 
Go tie an anchor round your necic ard then jump off the dock. 
You can h 
ar them in the summer and the winter just the same 
The cross-eyed, spavined, red haired, hump backed, blind, the 
ban and lame ; 
They form in long procession, and they march down to 
the dock, 
The nigs and whites singing ' bout the " Niggers on our block." 
It's'nough to drive one crazy, they've nearly got me mad, 
They average ninety young ones to just about one dad ; 
The mother, too, is busy, for she's adding to the flock 
'o join the army singing bout the " Niggers on our block." 
CHORUS. 
Little Sally Dead-eye sittinrr in the sun, 
Crying and wet.„'.nr for her daddy number one. 
Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your eyes out with your sock, 
You ain't the only kid who has no daddy on the block.

Driginally sung with thunders of applause throughout the Eastern cities 
by the" Irish Emperors," FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
Here we are, two Lackawanna spooners, 
While we're here cast your eyes upon us; 
We unload coal boats from Harlem to Gowanus, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace, 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race, 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
CHORUS. 
When we go home, our families we embrace, 
We ate our meals with elegance and grace ; 
We'll lay aside the shovel, for we long to have a 
race 
We're the two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all live down in John McSauley's building, 
Last election day we cast our votes for Tilden; 
And they all do say we're the solidest in the building, 
The two selected spooners of the gang. 
We all get shaved in the one barber shop, 
By the one man, his razor, and his strop ; 
We all get the lather from the one brush and cup, 
The two selected spooners of the gang.

lead a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet pace. 
CHORUS. 
A 
quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness. that's the life for me. 
I 
like to have my social sing, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
I 
love my wife, I 
love my friends with whom the time to pass; 
A 
reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
'Twill make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and wise. 
A 
quiet little home, &c. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you can 
To earn a 
name that will become an honest working man; 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll find 
A- life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind. 
A 
quiet little home, &c. 
Hours of Pleasure.

'Twas at a 
ball I 
first met my girl, 
The fairest in the land; 
She had pearly teeth and a 
dimpled chin, 
And a 
little slender hand. 
She skipped around in mazy waltz 
As graceful as a 
fawn ; 
When the dance was o'er I 
asked Irene 
To walk out on the lawn. 
CHORUS. 
We sat by the brook and the stars shone bright, 
And we whispered words of love on that summer night. 
So we walked and talked till it grew quite late, 
But I 
know she has my heart; 
Then I'll bless the day when we get wed, 
And from her I'll never part. 
Next eve we met, near a 
running stream, 
And I 
walked close by her side; 
I 
told her then how I 
loved her so, 
And she said she'd be my bride. 
How happy I'll be all the while 
When Irene is my wife. 
We will have a 
cot by a 
babbling brook, 
And we'll settle down for life. 
We sat by the brook, &c.

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fisnsn's,-OS1Tas

it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of 
flirting." Unfortunately, there is enoug,h 
of it done without any furtherr ecessity of explaining "how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called " 
flirting • 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: ' We have lately seen a 
neat itttle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlem en

Cards.—This Series of Cards Las been arrangccl 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such s. way as to be non-co.nmittal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
-z.tlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
, 
ment. AS a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which mistt have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the cliff 
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
Tte sentiments conveyed therein need net be 
adopted by the parties to th e 
game 
as th ei
r 
own, 
unl
ess i
t accords with 
the stato Of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
