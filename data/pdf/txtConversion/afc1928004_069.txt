THE 
THORO'BRED 
SONGSTER. 
THORO'BRED. 
Written by H. /ammo, and sung by E. P. 
DIXEY with great 
applause. 
Atr.—Dog's Meat Man. 
Now, attention all, to a 
song from me, 
It a 
hit at matters and things shall be ; 
But first let me tell you my name is Ned, 
And like my subject, I'm a 
Thoro'bred. 
Very much, now, of the thoro'bred clan, 
I 
might say mucher a 
thoro'bred man; 
Gay as they make ' ern from the heel to the head, 
A whole team myself, and a 
thoro'bred. 
Chorus. 
Gee up, gee whoa, glang glang 
Up to the score well go slap bang; 
Never mind the weather, but push on ahead, 
And I'll bet you you'll pass for a 
thoro'bred. 
We've thoro'bred horses, we've thoro'bred dogs, 
We've thoro'bred cats, and we've thoro'bred hogs; 
We've thoro'bred donkeys, and thoro'bred goats, 
And political hacks—thoro'bred turn- coats. 
We've thoro'bred sports, we've thoro'bred dupes, 
Thoro'bred actors and thoro'bred supes, 
Upon the world's great stage all rushing ahead, 
Each in himself and his way a 
thoro'bred. 
Gee up, gee whoa, &c. 
6 
DIXEY'S SONGS. 
We've thoro'bred dandies, in bob-tail coats, 
With choker collars about their throats ; 
Moustache, kid gloves and patent-leather boots, 
All smoking long nines, or paper cheroots. 
We've thoro'bred ladies, with swabs of hair 
All over their heads, from abroad somewhere, 
Five hundred or more a 
year, it is said, 
It takes for repairs on a 
dear thoro'bred. 
Gee up, gee whoa, &c. 
Of thoro'bred more I 
might sing you about, 
But the truth of my theme you folks may doubt; 
However, I'll mention ' fore I 
close my song, 
To be a 
thoro'bred you must come out strong; 
Mount any hobby that you think will pay, 
Work it yourself, and some airs display ; 
And I'll bet you a 
dollar, you'll come out ahead, 
And pass anywhere for a thoro'bred. 
. 
Gee up, gee whoa, &c. 
MISS FLORINDA JONES. 
WRITTEN BY 
ANGELO. 
Music published by Marsh & Co., 1317 Chestnut street. 
Of Miss Florinda Jones it is 
That I 
now sing about; 
The gayest of the gay girls round 
She is, without a 
doubt; 
'Tis said her Dad has Greenbacks made 
By dealing in old bones; 
And now he ''way up town somewhere, 
A brown-stone mansion owns. 
Chorus.—Oh you should know Florinda Jones 
The girl I 
sing about, 
The gayest of the gay girls round, 
She is without a 
doubt. 
DIXEYIS SONGS. 
Now Miss Florinda feels herself 
And cuts some capers queer, 
When out upon the promenade 
She daily does appear; 
Lor' me, what airs the gal puts on, 
When noticed by the beaux, 
The pave then scarcely wide enough 
You really would suppose. 
Oh you should see, &c. 
The back part of her head sustains 
The biggest kind of knob, 
And from it hangs ' way down her back, 
A 
stray curl like a 
bob; 
She wears a 
saucer for a 
hat, 
Which rests upon her nose, 
And drags a 
trail some yards behind, 
As o'er the curb she goes. 
Oh you should see, &c. 
She loves to show her pretty feet 
In boots with monstrous heels; 
That's why she so holds up het dress, 
As long the pave she steals; 
She's been to Saratoga Springs, 
The summer months to spend; 
And twists herself all sorts of shape, 
To walk the Grecian bend. 
Oh you should su, & c. 
She very seldom put on airs 
Before her Dad struck bones; 
And seldom, too, she pass'd me by, 
This same Florinda Jones; 
Now when we meet, one w9rd or smile 
Does she e'er condescend, 
But gives her great long trail a 
whirl 
And moves off on a 
bend. 
Oh you should see, &c.

DIXEY'S SONGS. 
TOMMY DODD. 
As Sung by Dixey. 
I 
lead somewhat an easy life, 
Like most men about town; 
But still I 
must submit to you 
I'm somewhat of renown; 
A speculative turn of mind, 
It may seem rather odd, 
I 
have a 
weakness, and it is 
A love for " Tommy Dodd." 
Chorus.—I'm always safe when I 
begin, 
Tommy Dodd, Tommy Dodd; 
Glasses round, cigars as well, 
Tommy Dodd, Tommy Dodd; 
Now. my boys, let's all go in, 
Tommy Dodd, Tommy Dodd; 
Head or tail, I'm safe to win, 
Hurrah for Tommy Dodd! 
In town, now, if you meet a 
friend, 
You cannot let him pass; 
Of course you must do something, 
You then propose a 
glass; • 
Now if I 
meet a 
chum or two, 
1 
nail them with a 
nod: 
Propose to each a " full grown dose," 
But submitting " Tommy Dodd." 
I'm always safe, &c. 
You've no idea the run of luck 
Which I 
have found the rule, 
Attends you, if you go in "hot," 
Of course remaining " cool." 
A purse is just in case of need, 
For you can ride rough-shod,. 
And live like any fighting cock, 
If you're up in " Tommy Dodd." 
I'm always safe, &c. 
DIxEY'S SONGS.

A 
friend of mine three daughters had, 
He asked me home to tea; 
I 
played and sung, when, by and by, 
They all " spooned" on to me; 
I 
couldn't court the lot, you know, 
For that would seem so odd; 
Bo I 
proposed that they'd decide, 
By way of " Tommy Dodd!" 
'I'm always safe, &c. 
NOT FOR JOE. 
New version, sung by Dixey. 
Joseph is my proper name, 
For short they call me Joe; 
I 
own I 
once was somewhat green, 
But that was long ago; 
I'm better posted now, I 
am, 
And want you all to know 
I 
shake my head, and thumbs my nose, 
At all who come at Joe. 
(Spoken)—You bet I 
do; then I 
sings— 
Not for Joe, not for Joe, 
If he knows it, not for Joseph, 
Not for he, not for Joe, 
Not for Joseph, oh my, no! 
I 
used to call all hands to drink, 
When I 
to taverns went; 
matter'd not, I'd leave none sit, 
But free I 
money spent; 
That's now played out, I'll have you know, 
Except when with a 
friend 
Who does the genteel thing with me, 
Then I 
a 
quarter'll spend. 
(Spoken)—This callin' up fellows you never seen 
before, or doesn't know, may pay the bar, but it 
doesn't pay Joe— Ohl no! 
Not for Joe, &c. 
DIXEY'S SONGS. 
A. candidate for office once 
Made promises to me, 
If I'd spend my stamps to get him in, 
Rewarded I 
should be; 
Says I, my boy, I've been there once, 
Excused I 
beg to be; 
You always, when election's passed, 
Forget the likes of me. 
(Spoken)—Yes, how they smile on you on ' lection 
day; but I 
tells ' em " I've voted"—after they 
treats. 
Not for Joe, & c. 
They can't get me on thimble rig, 
Nor any other game; 
Nor put on me stuffed.pocket-books, 
Oh no ! that's not my name. 
They can't get me in where it says 
"Coal office" on the door.' 
Where you go back and get for coal, 
4-11-44! 
(Spoken)—No, sir, I 
know the numbers. 
Not for Joe, &c: 
LORD LOVELL'S VELOCIPEDE. 
Air—" Lord Lovell." 
• 
Lard Lovell he stood by the garden gate, 
With his shining Velocipede, 
And whispered farewell to his Lady Bell, 
Who wished for his lordship good-speed. 
Speed, speed, speed, 
Who wished for his lordship good speed. 
"When will you be back, Lord Lovell ?" she said, 
* 
But he gave to her question no ifced— 
Placed his feet in the stirrups, and galloped away 
On his famous Velocipede. 
Pede, pede, pede, 
On his famous Velocipede. 
DIXEY'S SONGS. 
Then Lady Bell cried, in frantic alarm, 
"What a 
monster my lord is, indeed, 
To ride thus away from his loving young wife, 
On that horrid Velocipede!" 
Pede, pede, pede, 
On his famous Velocipede. 
Lord Lovell returned broken-hearted and sore, 
Broken-hearted, and, alas! broken-kneed; 
For he struck or. a 
post, nearly gave up the ghost,, 
And smashed his Velocipede ! 
Pede, pede, pede, 
And smashed his Velocipede. 
MORAL. 
Remember the fate Lord Lovell has met; 
Let this be your warning and creed: 
Stay at home with your wife for the rest of your life, 
And beware the Velocipede.. 
Pede-pede-pede, . 
And beware the Velocipede. 
CAPTAIN JINKS. 
New Version. 
You've heard me oft' before declare, 
The name 'of Captain Jinks I 
bear; 
Quite famous I'm now ev'ry where, 
Since I've been in the army. 
A 
battle I've ne'er been in yet, 
Ne'er been in yet, ne'er been in yet; 
But still I 
am the ladies' pet, 
And a 
Captain in the army. 
(Spoken)—Yes, there's no rubbing that out— 
Pm Captain Jinks of the horse marines, 
With lots of cheek but little means, 
And In most things quite up to beans, 
Since I've been in the army. 
12 
DIXEY'S BONGS. 
Full dress I 
don when I 
go out, 
No matter where, at ball or rout; 
Quite dignified I 
strut about, 
A style they've in the army. 
Thus it is ' mid crowds so gay, 
'Mid crowds so gay, ' mid crowds so gay, 
I 
oft-times hear young ladies say, 
That's Captain Jinks of the army. 
(Spoken)—Yes, the dear creatures, they know— 
I'm Captain Jinks, &c. 
Landlords and tailors I 
do brown, 
In this and many another town: 
For with the stamps I 
ne'er come down, 
Since I've been in the army. 
I've seen that dodge played with success 
Played with success, played with success; 
I've learned the ropes some, too, I 
guess, 
Since I've beep in the army. 
(Spoken)—Yes, 'twould be all right, when I'd 
tell 'em— 
I'm Captain Jinks, &c. 
I 
joined, of course, the horse brigade, 
Because I 
loved the gay parade; 
But fight you couldn't me persuade, 
Tim' I'm Captain in the army. • 
Of powder I 
can't bear the smell, 
Can't bear the smell, can't bear the smell; 
Both flying balls and bursting shell 
Are in the way in the army. 
(Spoken)—Yes, but don't you tell any of my 
lady acquaintances so, for— 
I'm Captain Jihks, &c. 
BONES says he was at a 
fire the other night, and 
they saved everything in the house except the 
piano. 
When asked why they didn't save that, he 
replied, " De engines couldn't play on de piano."

ON THE BEACH AT CAPE MAY. 
WRITTEN BY E. N. EIACIIM, ESQ. 
Music published tor R. Wittig & Co., 1021 Chestnut St., Philx. 
On the beach at Cape May, on an August day, 
Smoking a 
segar to pass the time away, 
List'ning to the waves as they beat against the 
shore, 
I 
saw a 
lovely form I 
ne'er had seen before. 
She wore a 
handsome Gabrielle, her waterfall was 
high, 
lier eyes were large as saucers, her nose turned to 
the sky; 
Oh, she was lovely to behold, she stole my heart 
away, 
This fair bewitching creature, that I 
met at gay 
Cape May. 
Chorus. 
On the beach at Cape May, on an August day, 
I 
saw this lovely charmer who stole my heart away; 
Now I 
feel so blissful, the happy moments glide, 
The- day is quickly coming when she shall he my 
bride_ 
I 
asked her if she'd take a 
walk, she smiled and 
said, I 
will; 
She said it, too, with such s. grace, methinks I,hear 
her still: 
And as we walked along the beach together arm 
in arm, 
I 
thought then if she'd marry me, I'd keep her 
from all harm. 
felt just thott all over, I 
cannot tell you how, 
She turned on ite her lovely eyes, I 
thought I'd 
faint, I 
vow; 
And smilingly, she said to me, with such a 
pretty

you're out.

DIXEY'S SONGS. 
We afterwards did bathing go, and now comes my 
mishap, 
In venturing out beyond the rest, a 
wave struck 
her "ker slap;" 
It carried her unto the shore, and safely she did 
land, 
My feet from under me did slip, I 
dove into the 
sand; 
The people all began to laugh as from the waves 
I 
rose, 
Both eyes were shut and filled with sand, and 
bleeding was my nose: 
I 
tried to stand erect, but fell down all the more, 
Until a 
gent compassion took, and led me to the 
shore. 
On the beach at Cape May, •ke. 
Now all you gents, you bucks, I 
mean, remember 
what I 
say, 
If you a 
sweetheart badly want, I 
recommend Cape 
May. 
A 
wife to win and wear, it is the place beyond a 
doubt, 
But first before you go, be sure your mother knows 
you're out; 
And if by chance you bathing go, don't venture 
out too, far, 
Just think of me, eyes filled with sand enough to 
make a 
bar; 
But try again, let people laugh, no matter what 
they say, 
A 
jolly, laughing, merry set, you'll find at gay Cape 
May. 
On the beach at Cape May, ttc. 
W HY is kissing a

Iork ? • 
Because you can't get enough of it at a 
time.

OH! WOULD I WERE A FLY. 
As sung by Dixey. 
Oh! would I 
were a 
fly, to buzz about all day; 
Oh! wouldn't I 
live high, without a 
cent to pay; 
And in store windows I 
would bask it in the sun, 
And lick molasses candy, Oh, wouldn't that be fun! 
I'd never mind the taxes, no matter how they'd 
rise; 
For while there's stamps on everything, there's 
none upon the flies. 
Chorus.—Oh! would I 
were a 
fly, 
To buzz about all day, 
Ohl wouldn't I 
live high! 
DUCEY'S SONGS.

Oh! if I 
were a 
fly, a 
buzzing I 
would keep, 
And hunt until I'd find some bummer chap asleep; 
So jolly it would be upon his nose to light, 
Or drop into his ear and there I'd buzz and bite. 
And if away he'd drive me, I 
would come back 
again, 
For flies are mighty lively, when plagueing sleepy 
men. 
Oh! would I 
were a 
fly, &c. 
Oh! if I 
were a 
fly, Pd on a 
gin glass light, 
Then I 
would sip, and sip, and never once get 
tight, 
Nor fear to be arrested, or through the streets to 
reel, 
For a 
fly can sip his toddy, and ne'er a 
headache 
feel: 
Oh, then how I 
would puzzle with no fear of hu-
man woes, 
• 
And never have a 
pimple or strawberry on my nose. 
Oh! would I 
were a 
fly, &c. 
Oh, if I 
were a 
fly, from place to place I'd roam; 
I'd have no rent to pay, I'd have no care at home; 
For unlike married men, then I 
would laugh at fate, 
And have no wife to scold me if I 
should stop out 
late: 
No falsehood I 
should try, or no excusive dodge, 
By telling Mrs. Fly that I 
was at the lodge. 
Oh! would I 
were a 
fly, &c. 
Oh! if I 
were a 
fly, some pretty girl I'd seek, 
And, just beneath her eye, I'd perch upon her 
cheek; 
And I 
would linger there, and fellers passing by 
Would all be sure to envy the happy little fly. 
If with a 
gal a 
feller a 
game like that e'er tries, 
She'd smack him in the snoot, or else she'd scratch 
his eyes. 
Oh! would I

The mother was most wild, 
She'd found a 
golden future for 
Her darling little child. 
But Polly would refuse him then; 
The madame took a

And swept her precious darling to 
The quiet of her room.

Twelve feet there were between,

To show me he would not be led, 
He broke the string—he would not come, 
And far away from me he tied. 
Since then I've hunted all Around, 
It does my very heart annoy— 
I 
fear he's taken to the pound, 
Or been sold to some butcher boy.

Whoever brings my dog to me,

nice reward; 
I 
know he's not at liberty 
To come home of his oivh accord.

Compels me now to sing; 
So listen, if you've time to spare, 
I'll at it have a

'Twas taught at Saratoga Springs, 
Which will it recommend— 
It transforms belles quick into ( beaux) bows, 
And's called the Grecian Bend.' 
Chorus.—No matter when or where you move, 
To style you must attend; 
With hands right placed twist up your waist, 
And walk the Grecian Bend. 
Our dears have Grecian on the brain, 
Including Grecian curls; 
No doubt in school they next will teach 
All Grecian to the girls. 
So when one Greek another meets, 
On war you may depend, 
With backs forced up like Kangaroos, 
They'll walk the Grecian Bend. 
No matter when, &c. 
Our little boys have caught it, too, 
And by it something gain; 
They pictures sell of bending belles, • 
Which will the style explain. 
In kitchen, parlor, on the street, 
And ball-rooms, too, no end, 
This folly has assumed some shape, 
And starts folks on a 
bend. 
No matter when, Ike.

How long this Grecian' will reliiain, 
I'm sure I 
do not know; 
But this I 
say, ' twill have its day, 
Then up like smoke quick go.

Which I

For exercise as well as health, 
Just try the Wash-tub bend.

Because you're treated handsome, and if you only

Gets cuttle-tish and chickenweed, and lots of bully

And to some charming creature you can breathe 
your love in song, 
And warble out your roundelays, right to her sweet

Then shell call you pretty names—you'll live in 
her boudoir— 
Now if you had to be a

As sung by Dixey. 
dir.—"The Days when we went Courting.* 
Oh ! when I 
led a 
bachelor's life, 
A long time ago, 
Oh, happy time ! my mind was then 
Both free from care and woe. 
No wife had I 
to think about, 
No little squalling brat, 
My life was one of gaiety, 
But now ' tis far from that. 
Chiffus.—Though now ' tis past, there was a 
time 
When I 
no care did know; 
'Twas when I 
led a 
bachelor's life, 
A long time ago. 
Those were the days when, with my friends, 
I 
think some eight or nine, 
We'd to the Schuylkill Falls repair, 
And there on catfish dine. 
We'd there, too, sit and quaff our wine, 
And drive dull care away, 
And never think of getting home 
Until the break of day. 
Though now, &c. 
But, bless my heart, how things are changed Ir 
Would you believe it, now, 
I 
never can go out to dine, 
Without there being a 
row ?

rumpus soon, 
And heaves a 
long-drawn sigh; 
Whene'er, without her, I 
go out, 
She begins awfully to cry

Entices me to roam, 
Why in the name of goodness, Fred, 
Can't you stay at home ?

Unless I'm by her side ; 
To rid me of this tyranny 
In vain I've often tried.

THE COM1CAL DARICIE. 
As sung by Dixey. 
I'm a 
comical darkie, d'ye see, 
At least you will say by'n by; 
For I 
can, in the hop of a 
flea, 
Change a 
gooseberry into a 
fly; 
Pm a 
wondrous philosopher, too, 
I 
can make out the moon to be cheese, 
And all of the stars that you see, 
I 
can prove to be nought but dried peas. 
You may stare at these things if you like, 
And into the truth of them pry, 
But I 
tell you there's not in the world 
A more comical darkie than I. 
Quite strong and quite stout I 
am built, 
Nothing can ever hurt me; 
I 
can do, too, whatever I 
choose-, 
No matter now what it may be. 
I 
can carry the world in my arms, 
And of its weight never complain ; 
I 
also can swallow a 
church, 
And spit it right up again. 
You may stare, &C. 
()nee up in a 
balloon I 
was sent, 
Observations to take in the sky ; 
How far do you think that I 
went? 
Why, up more than ninety miles high. 
The balloon caught fire by the way, 
On a 
rainbow -down slid I, 
And drank a 
whole hoffshead of beer, 
For I 
was confoundedly dry. 
You may stare, &c. 
I 
once to a 
jumping match went, 
It's every word true that I

I 
jumped up so wonderous high

On a

Where an old man dwells, so some people say, 
Through cutting of sticks of a

Up went the balloon, quickly higher and higher, 
Over housetop and chimney top, tower and spire ; 
I 
knocked off the monuments too, very nigh, 
And caught hold of the top of St. Paul's going by.

All among the little stars, sailing round the moon ; 
Up in a 
balloon, up in a

It's something awful funny to be up in a 
balloon. 
DIXEY'S SONGS. 
Up, up I 
was borne with terrible power, 
At the rate of ten thousand five hundred an flour; 
The air was so cold, the wind blew loud, 
I 
narrowly escaped being choked by a 
cloud; 
Still up, up I 
went till surrounded by stars, 
And such planets as Jupiter, Venus and Mars; 
The Big and the Little Bear loudly did growl, 
And the Dog Star, on seeing me, set up. a 
Up in a 
balloon, &c. 
I 
met shooting stars, who were bent upon sport, 
But who shot in a 
very strange manner, I 
thought; 
And one thing beat all by chalks, I 
must say, 
That was when I 
got into the Milky Way. 
I 
counted the stars, till at last I 
thought 
I'd found out how much they were worth by the 
quart: 
An unpolite Aerolite, who ran ' gainst my car, 
:Wouldn't give e'er a 
light to light my cigar. 
Up in a 
balloon, &c. 
Next a 
comet went by, ' midst fire like hail; 
To give me a 
lift I 
seized hold of his tail; 
To where he was going I 
did not enquire; 
We'd gone past the moon, till we couldn't go 
higher; 
Yes, we'd got to the furthermost—don't think I 
joke, 
When, somehow, I 
felt a 
great shock—I 
awoke! 
When, instead of balloon, moon and planets, I 
saw 
I'd tumbled from off my bed on to the floor I 
Up in a 
balloon, &c.,. 
CHORUS. 
And there was no balloon, there was no balloon, 
Neither were there planets, and there wasn't any 
moon, 
So, never sup too heavy, or, by jingo, very soon, 
You're like to fancy you are going up in a 
balloon.

MISS FLORA GUSHING. 
A 
SAD BUT TRUE TALE. 
Air—Raging Kanawl. 
Miss Flora Gushing was by all acknowledged 
fashion's Queen, 
And many a 
scene of splendor grand was by her 
. subjects seen ; 
As she went, so the nobs all went—whate'er she 
did was well— 
She joined the Saratoga ring, and soon became 
the belle. 
Her form and face were faultless, her name with-
out stain, 
Her dress was locomotive-like, it had so long a 
train.; 
But dire misfortune seized the girl, and caused her 
mournful end • 
Disease it took her o'ff right straight; 'twas called 
the Grecian Bend. 
She grew much worse, yet she received not pity, 
but abuse; 
And though she never had looked fast, they said 
she then looked loose; 
Her parents were in deepest grief—their hearts 
with pain were rent— 
Yet still the girl with Grecian Bend kept following 
her bent. 
At last when she found that her ways her friends 
and parents troubled, 
And that her form lost half its charms, although 
she thought it doubled, 
Ehe said henceforth she'd stand erect— which when 
she tried to do, 
She'd grown so stiff that, by my word, the damsel

THE YOUNG CARPENTER. 
In this city I've heard people say 
There once livid a 
dashing young blade, 
With the girls he was flirting and gay, 
And a 
carpenter was by his trade. 
Till at length by Cupid he got nail'd, 
By Hymen got glued to his dear. 
With his axe, axe, axe, chisel, chisel, chisel, 
Axe, axe, axe, chisel, chisel, 
Axe, axe, and gimlets, ' tis clear, 
In matrimony was this young carpentier. 
Now Chip's wife she had an old lovier 
A 
lovier what plough'd the salt sea ; 
Now he, naughty boy, left his mother, 
And a 
nautical man now was he. 
So when he came home he embracicl her, 
At the sight Chip fell right down with fear. 
With his axe, &c. 
With jealousy wild went this young carpentier. 
Then he went up stairs to his tool-chest, 
And then he did open the lid, 
He turned out every one of his tools; 
Right down to the bottom, he did ; 
From the downermost part he selected 
An instrument sharp and severe, 
'With his axe, &c. 
"Revenge I" then he cried, did this young carpal. 
tier. 
So he followed his wife down the street, 
He followed her down a 
dark lane, 
Then he followed her right round a 
square, 
And back by the same street again: 
He stabbed her somewhere round the corner, - 
Her screams were appalling to bear! 
With his axe, &c. 
He chopped her to mincemeat, did this young

Come listen to my ditty, 
And you my case will pity, 
Address'd to ladies pretty, 
Their tender hearts to prove. 
'Tis all about soft love, 
Which hearts of flint can move. 
A passion long been raging, 
Sweet, when its first stage in, 
But dangerous to engage in.

I 
sing the charms of love,

Which hearts of flint can move. 
If you wish to better your station 
By a 
hazardous speculation, 
Or slippery embarkation, 
You've only to fall in love. 
When first you go a 
courting, 
Your cash you must be sporting, 
A trap that woman's caught in, 
For naught like cash will move. 
You may try " My duck, my dove," 
And all such stuff in love,

When you jealous prove 
P R 0 V E—Prove. 
It plays the deuce in love, 
Ranting, tearing, roaring,

No more soft adoring,

With one Mr Shove. • 
If you wish, &e.' 
If you've plenty of money,

A case .they call crim. con., sirs, 
And fix your head upon, sirs, 
The emblem of false love.

So I

Then mind, friend Muggs, you ain't too late 
To go with us a

To Mr Spout, with my best clothes, 
And borrow'd what you might suppose 
To rig me out for fishing.

Then off we trudged through dust and sun, 
The perspiration off me run , 
Thinks I, I 
hope this ar'n't the fun 
Of going out a 
fishing. 
At length we reached the river side, 
And soon upon the glittering tide 
Our floats, like little boats, did ride, 
As floats do, when you're fishing. 
I 
felt a

tugg'd again, 
And pull'd away with might and main, 
When up I

When Snooks (you know he's such a

Soused in the stream to our surprise 
As though to spoil our fishing. 
You've heard about too many cooks, 
And as we strived to land old Snooks, 
We stuck him full of little hooks, 
With which we had been fishing. 
At length our friend on shore we brought, 
He puff'd and blow'd, you would have thought 
A 
full grown porpoise we had caught, 
When we were out a

What next to Jimmy Higgs befell 
When we were.out a

The sun was hot, the grass was green, 
lie sat him where the cows had been, 
And such a 
sight was his nankeen, 
When we were out a

Perched me up for fishing. •

In woodland, marsh, or bog, 
That creeps the ground or flies the air,

His eyes on top o' his head.

HOW THE MONEY GOES. 
Air.—Lazy Club. 
• 
We find throughout this earthly ball 
The " one thing needful" governs all; 
Big and little, dunces, scholars, 
Nothing's done without the dollars. 
That money flies, the poet sings,' 
On paper or on golden wings; 
It mares one look straight do vna his nose, 
To see the way the money goes. 
The ladies, by their love of' dress, 
Cause mankind's pockets deep distress; 
Fashion's follies each' one follows, 
Which plays the deuce now with our dollars. 
Your wife- just chucks you ' neath the .chin, - 
Hats, gowns and shawls are order'd in; 
Daughters must fix up for beaux, 
And that's the way the money goes. 
And then, again, the fast young boys, 
Who will indulge in tavern joys, 
And round the bar are daily found, 
Where bitters, wine and beer abound,— 
Whisky cocktails not a 
few, 
Fancy slings and juleps too, 
Till, drunk, they stagger home to doze, 
And that's the way the money goes.

The dollars have, in summer, wings, 
The ladies all must see the Springs; 
Traveling charges, hotel bills, 
Steamboats, railroads, and other ills. 
In winter, parties and balls abound, 
Or in a 
sleigh, you sport around, 
Stay out all night,—though hard it snows, 
And that's the way the money goes. 
No wonder money is so scarce, 
While market charges are so fierce ; 
'the price of pork brings great distress, 
And baker's loaves grow daily less. 
In meat's high price there's no decr9ase, 
In turkeys, fowls, or game or geese;

HOW THE MONEY COMES. 
Ain—Lazy Club. 
You've heard the song bow money goes, 
But how it comes, who knows ? 
Who knows? 
Why, every Yankee mother's son 
Can tell you how " the thing" is done. 
It comes by honest toil and trade; 
By wielding sledge and driving spade, 
And building ships, balloons and drums ; 
And that's the way the money comes. 
How does it come ? Why, as it goes, 
By spinning, weaving, knitting hose, 
By stitching shirts and coats for Jews, 
Erecting churches, renting pews, 
And manufacturing boots and shoes; 
For thumps, and twists, and cuts and hues, 
And heads and hearts, tongues, lungs and thumbs; 
And that's the way the money comes.

EloW does it cotne ? 
The way is plain— 
By raising cotton, corn and cane; 
By wind and steam, lightning and rain; 
By guiding ships across the main ; 
By building bridges, roads and dams, 
And sweeping streets and digging clams, 
And whistles, hi's, and ho's 4nd hum's ; 
And that's the way the money comes. 
The money comes—how did I 
say ? 
Not always in an honest way; 
It ,comes by tricks as well as toil; 
But how is that ? 
why, slick as oil, 
By putting peas in coffee bags; 
By swapping watches, knives and nags, 
And peddling wooden clocks and plums; 
And that's the way the money comes. 
flow does it come ?—wait, let me see,

It very seldom comes to me; 
It comes by rule, I 
guess, and scale, 
Sometimes by riding on a 
rail; 
But oftener that's the way it goes 
From silly belles and fast young beaux; 
It comes in big, nay, little sums, 
And that's the way the money comes.

When mirth and wine went free, 
Among a 
hundred crinolines 
As gay as e'er you see. 
Her robes were rich, her jewels fine.— 
I 
sought the hand of Kitty, 
To take a 
turn upon the floor, 
She answered, rather witty :—

We balanced, changed and swung, 
,And ever when a 
set was out, • 
Some charming- song was sung. 
And strange to say, my arm I 
found 
About my Kitty's waist.; 
She turned her head, and with a 
frown, 
Sang out to me in haste— 
Oh! don't, Mr Johnsing, &e.

And some would rest their feet; 
I 
drank a 
toast to all the fair,

And thought it not amiss 
To press upon her ruby lips

THE FROG AND THE FISHERMAN. 
[The chorus is intended to be an imitation of tlau 
croaking of frogs, 
Ker-chunk, ker-lunk, ker-chunk-a-lunk, 
and is repeated after each line : 1 
A 
frog once sat on a 
stump in a 
pond; 
Ker-chunk, ker-lunk, ker-chunk-a-lunk. 
Of flies this jolly old froggy was fond; 
Ker-chunk, etc. 
Of " skeeters" a 
heap he could eat a 
meal, 
Ker-chunk. 
But always after, he'd hungrier feel. 
Ker-chunk. 
He sat on an anxious seat, you may bet, 
Ker-chunk. 
For, 'twas almost dark, and a 
meal he must get; 
Ker-chunk. 
All at once a 
splendid great fly flew by, 
Ker-chunk. 
By thunder ! I've lost it,why wasn't I 
spry 
Ker-chunk. 
But no ; here it comes, I'll catch it this try," 
Ker-chunk. 
And he made a 
snap at a 
fisherman's fly, 
Ker-chunk. 
" 
Blast yer eyes! yer brute," the fisher, he cries, 
Ker-chunk. • 
" 
I'll teach yer to snap at my hackle flies," 
Ker-chunk. 
And he gave the poor frog, who hung kicking in air, 
Iier-chuuk. 
DIXEYIE1 SONGS. r 
A whack on the head, it was hardly fair, 
' 
Ker-chunk. 
Then he threw the mangled remains away, 
Ker-chunk. 
And continued his search for a 
nobler prey, 
Ker-chunk, ker-lunk- ker-chunk-a-lunk. 
MORAL. 
0 
man or frog, if from trouble you'd keep, 
Ker-chunk. • 
No matter how hungry, look sharp ere you leap, 
Ker-chunk, ker-lunk, ker-chunk-a-lunk.

MY UNCLE TOBY, 
-40.—' Things 1 
Dont like to See." 
My old uncle Toby was such an old tyke, 
If you'd rummage creation you'd not find his like - 
Bless your soul, he were up to all manner of things-, 
lie could cripple wild rabbits, and clip a 
crow's 
wings, 
And nibble the magpies that perched on the rails, 
By sprinkling salt on their innocent tails.. 
What a 
pity old Toby is laid in the ground r 
Were be here, he'd enlighten you all, I'd be bound. 
He could spell, write and cipher, chew carrots also? 
Swig ale and eat bacon, write verses and mow; 
Sing psalms, play the fiddle, and roll on the green, 
And for larking with milkmaids, his like was ne'er 
seen. 
He was clever in all things, both little and big, 
Be could out-mag Aunt Sukey, and comb her old 
wig. 
What a 
pity, etc. 
He was master of music, a 
thrasher of oats, 
An out-and-out glazier, a 
mdnder of coats; 
He could make globes and noggins, build hay-ricke 
and sheds, 
Locked hoops like a 
good one, and dealt in pig 
heads, 
Pipes, salmon and pepper, red herrings and snuffs, 
Ducks, ginger and lap-dogs, and prime apple-
puffs. 
What a 
pity, &c. 
He likewise sold treacle, twine, cork-screws and 
corks, 
Hops, mustard and horse- shoes, 
cock-sparrows 
and forks ; 
He wet' noted for grinding, and lugging teeth out, 
Be could take off a 
Quaker, make sermons and 
spout; 
He could brew, leap and whistle, and thatch a 
pig-sty, 
Knit stockings, fry pancakes, and bung a 
chap's 
eye. 
What a 
pity, &c.
