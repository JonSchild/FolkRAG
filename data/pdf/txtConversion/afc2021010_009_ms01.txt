Steven “Steve” Honaker (b. 1961, Fairmont, West Virginia) has been a rural mail carrier out of the 
Morgantown, West Virginia Post Office since 1992. His current route, which he has been delivering to for 
over 7 years, is about 50 miles with over 500 boxes. Honaker currently drives a Honda CRV as his mail 
vehicle. In this interview, he talks about his relationships with his customers and the gifts they often leave 
for him, how automation and the delivery of Amazon packages has changed the job, comradery with his 
coworkers, and changes in the weather he’s noticed over time.  
I was put in touch with Steve by my friend Molly Born, who is a childhood friend of one of Steve’s 
daughters. Steve had recently recovered from COVID-19, and we conducted the interview remotely. After 
the recording, Steve told me a story about five donkeys who hang out by one of the mailboxes he delivers 
to. He also mentioned delivering mail one day to a box where little girls were standing outside of it, doing 
a “Blues Clues” mail dance. Steve’s daughter Laura is also a rural mail carrier out of the Morgantown 
Post Office, serving the Maidsville, West Virginia area.

EH: So it is February 6, 2022, and I'm interviewing Steve Honaker. Did I say that correctly? 
 
SH: Yes! 
 
EH: (laughs) Okay. Why don't you introduce yourself and tell me your name, the year you were born, 
where you're from, and where you are today? 
 
SH: Okay, my name's Steve Honaker. I was born in 1961 and I have just lived here in Fairmont, West 
Virginia mostly my whole life. We've moved away for a few times but not much. Did I get all of it? 
 
EH: Yeah. Yeah!  So tell me about how you first got interested in becoming a rural mail carrier? 
 
SH: Well we live out in the country and have a rural mail carrier, so probably just seeing him travel back 
and forth and drop off the mail. We didn't really have much contact with him because you know, people 
in those days, we didn't get very many packages or anything like that. But we'd see him driving by and 
he'd always wave and he seemed like a friendly pretty happy guy, so we--I had some other jobs in 
different states--came back here and just needed a job and it seemed like a pretty good thing to do, so I 
think we looked up, I'd been hired in '92. Yeah, so right then you had to--they put an ad in the paper that 
said they needed rural carriers. And they had a test--it's like a big room where there's like probably 100 
guys in there all taking this handwritten paper test that asks you like basic questions and I remember a lot 
of it was about calculating postage, like if you had a 6-pound package and postage was so and so. I'm 
terrible about math, but in their example, they said the postage stamps were like 50 cents. Well it's pretty 
easy to do math with 50 cents, right? (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
SH: I did another test for a different location and the sample was like 45 cents. Where there's no way I 
can multiply 45 but I can multiple 50 pretty easily. So I did okay on that test and they called me up in 
Morgantown so I started working there in '92. 
 
EH: And are you still out of the Morgantown Post Office? 
 
SH: Yeah. With the rural carriers, it's real hard to change to a different location. So I'm pretty much just 
gonna, pretty much have to stay in the location you were hired at. 
 
EH: So how long is your route and how many boxes do you serve? 
 
SH: It's about 50 miles and there's I think there's a little over 500 boxes. So it's 500 families. So it's a lot. 
The routes vary a lot and some of the routes go up to 100 miles in Morgantown. I think in other areas 
even longer. But yeah, that's about how many people are on it. Some of it's like dirt country roads that 
you'd be afraid to take your car up, but other parts of it are in relatively nice, paved neighborhoods, so. It's 
just a whole, it's surprising how you can leave Morgantown and see all the different types of places 
people live just in a real close compact area.

EH: Mmhm, yeah, so... 
 
SH: There's housing developments that are right beside farmlands, you know. 
 
EH: So is that considered a high-density route? 
 
SH: Not really. They do the, I don't know how much details you want to go into. Density is like if you 
have more than 12 boxes a mile or less than 12 boxes a mile, and mine has less than 12 boxes a mile.  
 
EH: I see. Yeah, tell me about the terrain on your route for someone who has maybe never been to 
Morgantown or West Virginia, what's the landscape look like? 
 
SH: Okay. I leave the post office. My route, I don't get on the interstate any. Some routes have to travel 
on the interstate to get to where their actual delivery area is. So I'll drive just out a 2-lane paved road, it's 
kinda busy. There's like a cement plant and gravel trucks and stuff you have to watch out for. But then 
like wherever there's a side road, I have to go out that side road, see? So within a few miles I have to go 
out this side road that goes down to, it's a narrow 2-lane road, you know, it's almost hard for 2 cars to get 
by, but it's paved! And I go past a nature preserve--it has real pretty forests and everything. And I actually 
travel all the way down to the river, right where I turn around, there's an access point where people go on 
the rail trail so I can pause and look out across the river for a little bit and zoom back up to the paved road 
and then basically that's what it is. You just go out the main artery and then do all the side roads off to the 
side. So some of those are nice roads. Some of them are terrible!  
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
SH: Really, they are! And then I travel like, the elevation change makes a big difference like in the 
winter. So I travel up probably like a thousand feet higher than Morgantown. So there can be no snow at 
all in Morgantown and you travel up on this higher--we call them mountains, they're really just hills. You 
travel up there, you can be getting in like 6 inches of snow. So you know, there could be a big difference 
just in that difference in elevation. And you just have to, like sometimes if it's real snowy, you can just 
look at it and say, well I can't get out that side road, you know, so you can just bring that mail back later. 
But then as I get on the different paved roads, I've got some that are unpaved roads. One goes right down 
near a pretty creek where people go trout fishing and stuff. So I drive along that little trout stream but then 
I have to climb up this really steep hill that's unpaved. And sometimes it's a little scary getting up that hill, 
honestly! But I can make a loop around. I have a Honda CRV that I drive. I use my own personal vehicle. 
And I think because those few roads are so rough, the post office probably won't provide a vehicle. You 
know, some of the routes the post office provides vehicles for. They just use the regular city carrier trucks 
or they have a van they use now. But it's pretty much every kind of road you can think of from roads with 
like trucks driving on it to like little neighborhood roads where there's like housing developments with 
just really nice little houses, and I just go up each little drive, not each driveway, each little road, and 
deliver all the boxes, loop around, come back, get back on the main road. And at the end of the 50 miles, 
I'm back at the post office. 
 
EH: So it's sort of a little loop. 
 
SH: Yeah.

EH: Oh what was I gonna say. Has the route changed at all since you first started? 
 
SH: They put in more housing developments mostly, though the rural areas, they stay about the same but 
sometimes they might just--there might be like a big cow field. They'll sell that cow field and they'll start 
putting in homes and they can put in like a home every month and that really adds up a lot. In that case 
specifically, what we can do is like if different routes become available, we can change to a different 
route. So like, I got off that route. (laughs) Where they were building houses every month. 
 
EH: Oh I see! 
 
SH: I left that route! (laughs) 
 
EH: Do you know how many rural routes are out of the Morgantown Post Office? 
 
SH: Hmmm...there's probably at least 25 that are all about the same size as mine. Then they have some 
that are called auxiliary routes that are shorter, so they have a few of those auxiliary routes and the routes 
are all different lengths. They have like a calculation process where they determine how long the route is 
and how much you should get paid. So if you're on a long route and you're a little bit work out, if a new 
route becomes available, you can change. So I've changed routes several times while I've worked there. 
Some people though, whatever route they're assigned to, they just stay with that one route the entire time. 
I couldn't do it. I know one guy retired not too long ago. He'd been on the same route for 40 years.  
 
EH: Wow. 
 
SH: And obviously, he knew every detail about everyone on that route after 40 years. I haven't done that. 
I've changed routes. I just got burned out on them. 
 
EH: Mmhm. Probably nice to switch things up a little. 
 
SH: I thought so. 
 
EH: So how long have you been doing your current route?  
 
SH: Probably at least 7 years. I've stayed with it a good while. It's a pretty good route. I like the country 
part where you drive along the trout stream and all that. I'd rather do that, where some people like to just 
go to a more densely compact neighborhood and just get everything finished altogether. But I'd rather 
have a little driving back and forth in between. I don't mind driving out roads like that. 
 
EH: Yeah, tell me about your customers and some of the people that you've gotten to know. 
 
SH: I'll try. You know I don't have a very good memory and I don't want to say anything too negative, 
okay? 
 
EH: Yeah (laughs).  
 
SH: (laughs) So I won't mention the people that frustrate me, but there are a few, right? (laughs) But I was 
just thinking the other day, one time I was driving down--I had a package to deliver and their driveway 
was kind of steep and muddy. I drove down and I couldn't get out even in my 4-wheel drive car, so I'm 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022

trying to think of what I'm gonna do. I hear this old tractor come putting up the road. It comes down the 
driveway. I'm like hey! Oh man, what, is there some way--at the time, people were better about pulling 
out. I said, "Is there anything you can do to help me?" He said, "I knew you were going to get stuck as 
soon as you pulled down this driveway." (laughs) So he just hooked his tractor up to me and pulled me up 
that hill.  
 
So a lot of times like if I'll have trouble or something like that, people will go out of their way to help me. 
And I've got to know people a little bit. I'm not as good as some other carriers about chatting with people. 
But you know, you kind of develop like a little relationship and you kinda trust people and you hope they 
trust you to get things done.  
 
One story--I was, at one time when you delivered food stamps, they had to be signed for and it was a real 
problem because the day that those food stamps came out, you might have like 50 packages of food 
stamps you had to get signed for individually. And I was real late on this route and I saw a lady that was 
standing off to the side by her mailbox. I said, oh I know she needs her food stamps. So I just went off to 
the side and I said, here I'm not going to be back to your mailbox for hours, but you can sign for these 
now. So she signed for them. I went around my route and I came back and that lady was still standing 
beside her mailbox and I'm like, oh you know, what's up, what do you need? She gave me this, a couple 
pieces of Chef Boyardee pizza and she said, I knew you were gonna have a bad day out here so I (laughs) 
took my food stamps--she bought these Chef Boyardee pizzas, and she made me a couple slices of pizza. 
That was so nice. 
 
EH: Aw. That's very sweet. (laughs) 
 
SH: Yeah. And a lot of people are real nice about things like that, you know, and friendly. I kinda like 
that part of the whole job. The part about especially working at the Post Office, I just hate that, but it's just 
like a breath of fresh air to get out of that where you can get out of your car and drive around and drop 
stuff off for people. As long as it's not too many things to drop off. (laughs) 
 
13:14  
 
EH: Right. Do people leave you other things--gifts or food or money or anything like that? 
 
SH: Well mostly it's just like people leave like boxes, like brownies or someone might leave a coke in 
there or something like that. And when I first started, I had a really rural route. It was like a lot of really 
poor families out there. And they would leave me little things like that, like the piece of pizza, you know, 
she was there in person so that was no problem. But they'd leave me things, and I'd think, aw man, I can't 
take that. And I'd leave a note saying I can't take that. And one guy stopped me and he said, you know in 
a way you're kinda of, you know, they want to give that to you and if you don't just accept it, then it kinda 
makes, it kinda messes the whole thing up. It makes them feel bad if you don't accept it, right? So I just 
always try to leave a little note that says thank you if they leave me some little thing like that. But it is 
always sweet. But mostly it's just, I just like people when they're friendly and easy to get along with. Most 
people are. Some people, you get some controversies with people. One of the big things is nobody wants 
their mailbox to get hit by something--I don't know what. And people have these mailboxes that have 
been there for 5 years and they're afraid they're gonna get hit, so they'll put them real far off the road so I 
can't reach them, right? And I'll have to fight with them and get them to move their mailbox out to a 
location where I can reach it, you know? Little things like that. But that's about the only thing I get upset 
about (laughs).

EH: Yeah. 
 
SH: Because you can't really get mad at anyone because you're gonna be back there tomorrow, right? It's 
not like you can just ignore people or stay away from them. You're gonna be there again if it's not a 
package dropped off, something to sign for, something like that, you're gonna be back there again soon. 
So I just try to be friendly to everyone. 
 
EH: Yeah, that's true. How did you learn the craft? 
 
SH: They just dump it on you. Well, they've gotten a little bit better in the past 20 years. But they just--I 
had no idea how it worked. I just knew from my childhood--that guy drove around in his Ford Bronco and 
put mail in people's boxes. That's what most people understand about it. And then I went to the post office 
and there's this one guy that was training me and he had a Ford Bronco too. And he's like okay, we have 
this, like these shelves with a little slot and one slot goes to each family. And in those days, it was a 
wooden set of shelves that must have been from like the 20s I bet. And you have to go through all these 
piles of mail and put each letter in each person's individual slot, right? And that's really time consuming. 
Then you have to look at all their packages and put them in order. Get everything organized in an orderly 
fashion and like you should have a pile where the first piece of mail you're going to deliver is on top of 
the pile. You put that in and go to the next and then when you get to the bottom of the pile, you're at your 
last box, right? Well we went out and he's just flying out this route, putting mail in each box, no problem. 
And I said, how do you know which boxes are which--they don't have markings on them! And he said, 
you'll learn that, don't worry about that. You'll learn that. You can't learn that! Because the first day you 
go there, you might have 10 boxes in a row that aren't marked and you don't know which person got mail, 
which person didn't get mail. So I was just at a loss. I go back to the post office--the doors were all 
locked, there was no one there, and I'm just sitting in the parking lot with all this, people's outgoing mail--
I had no idea what to do with it. So I put it in the outgoing mail slot, and I wasn't even scheduled to work 
the next day but I came back in and I said, I've got this equipment and stuff, and they're like, well you 
need to learn that route. What I really needed to do was mark all the mailboxes. Once I did that, I was 
able to get through it okay, but oh, those first month or so was just terrible. It just took forever. But it's 
still really hard to learn a new route. And the people that are substitutes now, see I was really just 
assigned to his route for a good while. Then I had two other routes I learned, so I just had those three 
routes. But now, they'll just--they might someone in from a different post office and say, here's a route, go 
out and deliver it! And I don't know how they do it nowadays. I make sure on my route that either I get 
the customer to mark all the mailboxes, or I'll just take a magic marker and write on the door what the 
number is so someone knows which mail goes in which box. And you know, it's like real basic things like 
if there's, if the mailbox is not marked, right, then don't put any mail in it. Right? So a lot of the stuff they 
do is just so basic, you know, like putting the mail in order so you can get to it easy. And you know, we're 
doing those techniques like from who knows where--Ben Franklin--and then right beside us they've got a 
big, computerized parcel sorter that's flying through stuff, a million packages a second or something, you 
know. It's just funny how you have a combination of old techniques and new techniques together. But it 
works pretty well. Like I said, my first months or so were terrible and I'm real bad about learning new 
routes, because you have new customers, you're not sure where their houses are, you're not sure you 
know, if someone moved out a couple years ago--you don't know that. So I'm not very good at learning 
new routes.  
 
EH: How has your work changed over time?

Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022

SH: There's a lot more of it for us because they do some things with the automation, like at one time all 
the letters were just sorted out by these 4 people that sat in the back of the post office and said, that's route 
5, that's route 4, that's route 3, right? But now the mail will come where it's been sorted by these 
computers into like just individual people, so it's all--the letters are all in a pretty good order, so that 
makes it a lot easier, but when they calculate up how much we get paid for our routes, they say, well, 
we're not going to pay you as much for that, so they cut our pay a lot because getting those letters in order 
was so much easier for us, but it's actually not as much easier as they say, right? So it seems like we do a 
lot more work now, especially once the Amazon parcels started because with Amazon, with the free 
shipping, there's a person on my route, at least, I think it's twice a month, he gets two huge boxes that are 
dog food. And that pretty much fills up the entire back seat of my car. And if you get a couple other 
people that do that, then your car is completely full! So you have to set those big parcels aside to your 
regular mail route and then go deliver those big parcels, see. So with all the Amazon extra parcels, I 
imagine probably almost 50% of the work I do is just Amazon parcels. That's how many Amazon parcels 
we get. We just get hundreds of 'em a day for each route. So it just takes so much more time sorting 
through those packages. You know, I said they do that--they call it an evaluated route. The evaluations 
that we have, they did like 5 years ago. So they're from before Amazon really caught on and they're from 
before all the COVID mail started. So we're just working like 10 hours a day every day. It's really a lot 
more work with all the Amazon parcels. But you get to know certain people pretty well because there's 
certain people get most of the Amazon parcels. Luckily everyone hasn't caught on to that yet.  
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
SH: (laughs) 
 
21:58  
 
EH: So you learn things about people, delivering their mail? 
 
SH: I try not to be nosey or anything, but you know, people talk to you and discuss things and you'll 
realize, like those 2 people they live next door to each other, but they're not good friends, so you make 
sure you don't get their mail mixed up! (laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) Right. 
 
SH: Then family members and all. The guy I mentioned earlier that worked for 40 years on the same 
route, he would, he'd have a package for someone and he'd say, oh, they're never home. I'll leave them at 
their daughter's house. So he knew to do that. And I'll do that with other people that I've, you know, got to 
know or I've talked to, like if someone has some reason, I can't get the parcel to their house I can just 
leave it at a certain neighbor's house, you know, things like that. So, I try not to get too nosey into 
people's things. Sometimes things just come up, you know, I don't know if this is a good story, but one 
lady--she was moving to Florida, right? And I said, well are you gonna come back? Because a lot of 
people go to Florida for a month and come back. I said, are you gonna come back? And she said, "I'm not 
sure. I'm going down to get the treatments. If they don't work, I might not be back." And I'm like "Oh no! 
Why did I bring that up?" 
 
EH: Whoa! (laughs) 
 
SH: (laughs) Right? One poor lady I had a package that had to be signed for, and I didn't know much 
about it, you know, I just brought it up for her to sign for it. She started bawling. I'm like oh my gosh, I'm 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022

sorry, what's wrong? It was her husband's ashes from where he'd been cremated? Oh I felt so terrible. 
(laughs) 
 
EH: Wow. (laughs)  
 
23:45  
 
SH: But those are bad stories. Other times, you know, like you obviously know when someone has a baby 
because nowadays, before a baby comes, they start getting the car seats from Amazon and then they order 
the diapers and you can tell they'll start out getting the baby diapers and a couple months later they'll get 
the bigger diapers and then hopefully they grow out of the diapers and you can stop delivering them! 
(laughs) 
 
EH: (laughs) Yeah! When will your route be re-evaluated? 
 
SH: I have no idea. Did you go to that conference [the Kentucky Rural Letter Carriers Association winter 
meeting]? 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. It seems like it's coming up soon. 
 
SH: What they're gonna do is, somehow, they're going to use some kind of computer count of the mail 
that we have, which I don't see how that will work, and then they'll do like--we have these scanners, 
right? And so the scanners will like, they'll know when we went to someone's house. And they say they're 
accurate enough that they can tell like when you get out of your car and walk a package over, walk a 
package back, because, I don't know. I think we get like 2 minutes per package in that evaluation, which 
you know, that's okay if you're just putting a package in someone's box, but if you have to drive a quarter 
of a mile up some dirt road, get out, fight someone's dogs to drop off a package, then you know, it's all 
supposed to even out. Well supposedly they're just gonna base all of our pay off this computer data, so 
you can imagine, I'm not very--I'm worried about that. (laughs) I really am. 
 
EH: Yeah, there seemed to be a lot of questions about how that was gonna work. 
 
SH: Because it's completely opaque, I guess would be the thing. We have no idea what they're doing with 
that. You know, they say they have these task forces but they had task forces when they did that sorted 
out mail, they call it DPS where the mail's sorted. And we lost all kinds of time then. I like to look at it 
like you think there's like the mail handlers, there's city carriers or rural carriers--you would think you'd 
all make about the same amount now, but we work way more hours than the city carriers and we make 
way less money.  
 
EH: Really? 
 
SH: Oh yeah. The city carriers get paid by the hour! You know, what's wrong with that? And if they work 
over their 8 hours, they just get overtime, right? Where we, they did this evaluation and as part of that 
evaluation they kind of work in that you're probably gonna work an hour a week extra on my route. My 
route was like an hour a week extra. So I get that hour every week whether I work it or not. You see? But 
I always work it! And I'm not the slowest person there, you know? So it just seems like we're not keeping 
up with the city carriers. And I personally, I don't see why they can't just pay us by the hour, you know? 
 
EH: Right, right. Yeah, that's interesting.

SH: In the past, that whole evaluated system was kind of an incentive system to work faster, right? But 
then they kinda started saying, well these rural carriers, they're getting paid 9 hours a day but they're only 
working 8 hours--we need to find a way to whittle that down. And then once the whole Amazon thing 
started, that just really killed us. (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah, right, right. And that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. 
 
SH: Unless they would open like a thing where Amazon would deliver their own packages. 
 
EH: Yeah, right. 
 
SH: Which is possible but I think the way that that works is when we deliver these packages out on the 
rural parts of the county, there's no way an individual person would be able to do that. They're gonna--if 
Amazon delivers their own packages, they're just gonna do it downtown and then the rural people are still 
gonna get their packages to deliver. Because when the packages come from Amazon, they don't come 
through like the normal postal system. They just have an Amazon truck that stops at the post office and 
drops off the mail--and then they have to sort it out to each route there. So I think Amazon would just take 
the parcels that go downtown and they'll handle those, and bring us the ones that are hard to deliver and 
you know with their, with Amazon's date and everything, they know which packages are hard to deliver 
and which ones aren't. Right? So then we'll get all the bad ones! (laughs) But I'm really worried about the 
thing where they're going to use the computers to calculate our pay. Another thing is like, the way I 
understood it, they're going to recalculate it like every 26 weeks? Must be like every 6 months, something 
like that. So you might get paid a little bit more during the Christmas season, and then they'll pay you less 
during the rest of the year, which is you know, I would rather have like a yearly thing, right? It's hard to, 
it's hard to budget things if you might get paid a lot less half the year than the other half of the year. So I 
don't know. They're taking a really complicated system we have now and it sounds like it's going to be an 
even more complicated system to pay us. But it's a more complicated system that we don't understand at 
all the part with the computer--the scanners and all that. I'm 60 now, so hopefully a few years from now 
I'll be able to retire.  
 
So, but oh you mentioned having relationships with people on my route, right? I don't know if I can bring 
something else up but a lot of the thing is like, you have a relationship with the people you work with! 
Because we're, it's really hard to change to another post office, so we're pretty much stuck with the 
people, those 20-some people, really more because there's the regular carriers then there's the substitute 
carriers, there's auxiliary carriers, things like that. You know, more like an old-time job where people 
would be stuck in one place together, where now it seems like they come and go a little bit more than they 
used to. But we're just kinda all stuck in there and you know, you get to know people really well and one 
thing I'll mention--one of the people that I work with is my daughter! 
 
EH: Oh cool! 
 
30:47 
SH: I know! Back when I started like in '92, she was probably like 3 years old, 2 or 3 years old. So we 
had her before I started, then after I started I had my second daughter. But my first daughter Laura, she, I 
don't know! She likes the idea of it, so whenever she had a chance, she took the test. When she took the 
test, I think she had to drive to Pittsburgh to take it, so they made it a little bit harder to find out how to 
get the job because now you don't get a thing in the paper. You have to like go online and you have to 
find which division, which job you're signing up for. And then you have to find what post office you're 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022 
11 
 
signing up for. You know, it's kind of a complicated process to find out how to get the job. But she went 
through all that and next thing I know, there she was working at the post office and now she works like 
about 10 feet away from me every morning, for a few hours you know, and then once you get all your 
mail sorted out, everyone leaves and you don't see them again. 
 
EH: So is she a city carrier or a rural carrier? 
 
SH: No, she's a rural carrier too! Yeah! 
 
EH: Oh nice! 
 
SH: I know. I wish she would talk to you, but she's not interested at all. 
 
EH: (laughs) 
 
SH: I know. Her, she's real quiet. She doesn't like to talk to people. But her route it is one of those 100-
mile routes and it's really bad dirt roads. She drives a Honda CR-V like me. Those CR-Vs are really good 
at going in the snow and they're real maneuverable. So a lot of people use CR-Vs. But she has a few less 
people because she has so many miles to drive. You know it's kind of a balance--if you drive more, you 
have less boxes. But she just likes it! She just gets out there and zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! I don't 
know if you've ever heard of a town called Maidsville? It's just like a... 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
SH: ...a tiny. It's not even a town, you know, it's just like a place where there's a few houses together. And 
she says, talks about being the queen of Maidsville because everyone sees her coming up, and "Hey, there 
goes the mail lady!" She's in a hurry so she always zips, zips, zips. 
 
EH: Mmhm. Everyone wants their mail. 
 
SH: It's kinda nice--it's nice to work with you know, your daughter there like that and you get to see her 
every day. I keep telling her, I wish she'd get a better job. She enjoys it! 
 
33:16  
 
EH: Mmmhm. 
 
SH: Yeah, some people really like it! 
 
EH: Yeah. Yeah, so the people that you're sorting the mail with every day, you've worked with them for a 
long time? 
 
SH: Sure, sure. I have a picture where one lady I work with named Donna, you remember when they used 
to have Bring Your Daughter to Work Day? 
 
EH: Yeah. (laughs) 
 
SH: We have a picture of me and Donna standing there and we've got our daughters with us. They're like, 
probably like 7 or 8, you know. Of course now they're grown up and have kids and everything. Me and 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022

Donna are still plugging away! Right? And then some people that I've known real well, they move on, 
they retire, so. 
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
SH: We're not really a family, but a lot of times, even just those 3 or 4 hours in the morning, that might be 
more than you see someone that's in your real family, right? 
 
EH: Yeah, right. 
 
SH: I don't know if you've ever had a job like that or if you work like that now where you're around 
someone really close. 
 
EH: Mmhm, mmhm. Yeah, it's nice. It's always good when you have some friends.  
 
SH: Mmhm. 
 
EH: Friends at work. 
 
SH: So it seems like old-time jobs would be more like that. You'd start, you'd have your whole career and 
then you'd retire. I don't think that's how all jobs are now, but the post office still is. 
 
EH: Yeah, that's cool. What vehicles have you had over time besides your CR-V? 
 
34:56  
 
SH: Oh! Okay, I started I had a 2-wheel drive Toyota truck, right? Standard transmission and when we'd 
drive these vehicles--if we ever meet, I want to show you my car--how I sit in that car, because I sit right 
in the center. And I have my feet on the driver's side working the controls and I am sitting in the middle 
and then I lean out to put the mail in, right? But I'm sitting right in the center with both of my feet on the 
driver's side. But sometimes it's easier to put your right foot in the passenger side--just drive with your 
left foot, you know? Which is no problem if you have an automatic transmission. But I did it with a 
standard transmission for some unknown reason! I don't know how on earth I did that, right? But that 
little 2-wheel drive truck, I would have to put chains on it a lot just to get going. And it did okay, but I 
think I got like 250,000 miles on that truck. And then I moved up to a 4-wheel drive Tacoma, but still a 
standard, so it was impossible to work that clutch, but I did it for a few years. And then I (sneezes) sorry. I 
finally got the manual transmission--that just helped out so much. So I had like 4 Toyota Tacomas and 
each one of those ended up with over 200,000 miles on them. Personal use also. And then I got started on 
the CR-Vs and they really go in the icy snow just about as good as the 4-wheel drive trucks did. They're 
all-wheel drive. And the brakes are even better. So I just put like, whenever it gets, usually sometime 
around December I'll put real snow tires on my car. A lot of people put studded tires on their CR-Vs and 
it does pretty good. You know, I've done the route enough now that I know like certain people's 
mailboxes are in a bad ditch. Don't even try to get close to those, right? So you know, when you drive the 
same roads every day, you get an idea where the slippery spots are and I think I haven't got stuck so bad I 
had to get pulled out for several years, but we're all real good at like if you get stuck a little bit, we know 
how to get out, you know, we've got the--I've got some of those little tire cable things I can put on if it 
gets real slippery and just get out there and dig the snow out and get our cars out pretty much ourselves! 
Because you can't help getting stuck every once in a while, you know. It's like if you're driving on a 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022 
13 
 
snowy road, you think, well I made it okay! If you're a mail car, you've got to get to the steepest, iciest 
hill, you've got to stop, lean out, put someone's mail in their box, then start out again, you know? 
 
EH: Mmmm, yeah, yeah. 
 
37:56  
 
SH: So I've been using the CR-Vs since then. They did fine and then it got to where over the years 
Christmas would get so busy that I got one of those cartop carrier things that I would put on top and 
usually when I got the snow tires, I'd put that cartop carrier on there for the extra parcels and now I use 
that thing every day. We have so many more parcels than we used to, it's just unbelievable. When I leave 
the post office, my car will just be packed from the floor to the ceiling with packages. It's either that or 
come back and make a second trip and nobody wants to make a second trip after you're finished for the 
day, right? (laughs) 
 
EH: So yeah, is it hard to know where the parcels are for each box? Do you have a system of 
organization? 
 
SH: Yeah, it's impossible.  
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
SH: You mean as far as dropping them off at the right houses or keeping them in order? 
 
EH: Yeah, just like keeping them in order in your car to orient to the route. 
 
SH: Yeah, I'm real careful. Sometimes it doesn't look like I'm real careful but (sniffs) when I wind them 
up, I kinda put them in a beginning to end order. Then I'll put the end parcels in my car first, right, so 
when I get done the first parcels are on top. And a lot of us have started--Amazon printing on their 
addresses is so tiny that we'll take a magic marker and write the address larger so we can see it, you know, 
when our eyesight gets a little bad. So now I've got to where I'm pretty good about pulling up to the first 
house, the first parcel will be on top, the first mail will be on top of the pile, and the hope is as I go down 
that--usually like I'll hit the brakes too hard or something and they'll just all get scrambled up! (laughs) 
 
EH: Oh no! (laughs) 
 
SH: The packages will get scrambled up. So the whole day is just constantly reorganizing things or 
looking for packages and people will come out and say, "Hey do I have something?" And I'm like, it's in 
here someplace, it's just gonna take me a minute to find it! (laughs) But they all laugh at that, they don't 
mind. But those are the vehicles I've used. The Honda CR-Vs they really do good. A lot of the carriers 
though, they get specially made Jeeps that have right hand drive, which I would love to do but those 
things are like 60,000 dollars.  
 
EH: Wow. 
 
SH: I know. I can get like 4 Honda CR-Vs, right, and the CR-Vs are really reliable. But I'm kind of 
jealous of the Jeeps. My daughter has one of the right hand Jeeps, but she doesn't use it. She just leaves 
her CR-V at the post office, and she'll drive her Jeep back and forth, and then she'll use her CR-V to 
deliver mail. Because she doesn't want to tear up an expensive Jeep, right? 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022 
14 
 
 
EH: (laughs) Even though it's right side drive? 
 
SH: Yeah! It would be easier, but she's used to doing the CR-V. And I'm used to it but it does, it does hurt 
your back. Like I had to have a back operation at one point because it was just hurting so much to 
constantly be leaning out the left hand side, you know 500 times a day, leaning back and forth. So it does 
hurt your back and shoulders, so a lot of people get a rotator cuff thing, or get problems with their back up 
high. A couple of people have had operations up there. That's a big problem. Really that's worse than--
they always talk to us about lifting heavy packages, but to me it's more the leaning out your car 500 times 
a day does more damage than lifting something. 
 
EH: Yeah, the repetitive motion. Yeah. 
 
SH: Yeah.  
 
EH: Yeah, have you seen noticeable changes in weather since you first started in '92? 
 
42:05  
 
SH: Oh yeah. When I started there were a lot of times where like the snow would be up over people's 
mailboxes. I'm not kidding. And partly it's because when they plow the snow, they plow it up beside the 
mailboxes, but you would have to move like drifted snow away from their mailboxes to get in there 
because the snow was so high! And it would be icy like for weeks on end. And like I had the 4-wheel 
drive Toyota trucks and I would have to use chains a lot. And I remember a couple times like even in my 
Toyota truck with chains trying to go down a road and it would just stop going because the snow was so 
high that it'll lift up your vehicle. It gets under your vehicle, lift up to where your wheels don't grab, so 
you have to back up. We haven't had a winter like that for a long time. I remember when I was little 
seeing people drive trucks on the Monongahela River because it would ice up so much that people would 
drive trucks down there! 
 
EH: Wow. That's crazy! 
 
SH: You couldn't imagine getting ice that thick now, right? 
 
EH: Yeah, no. 
 
SH: And that's just since I've been around. I don't know if it's just a cycle, but right now winters aren't as 
bad as they used to be, which I appreciate! It's still icy. You have to watch out for the ice, but yeah that 
real deep snow. We have them every once in a while, but it doesn't seem like it's as bad as it used to be. 
 
EH: Do you listen to the radio or books on tape or anything like that? 
 
43:40  
 
SH: Pretty much I just live by the podcasts now. I listen to all those and you know, just the normal ones--
nothing too weird. But that really helped out a lot because you know, music, I like music but especially 
music on radio, that's just impossible right? And some of the, some people can listen to certain radio 
stations all day long. I can't do that! (laughs) 
 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022 
15 
 
EH: Yeah! (laughs) 
 
SH: There's certain radio stations a certain type of person can listen to for hours on end and I can't do that, 
but I like to listen to National Public Broadcasting and I listen to them usually in the morning and I kinda 
drift off at the Classical hour and I'll starts listening to my podcasts. There for a while I would listen to 
books on tape some, and I would listen to old radio shows. Like you can get a CD that has like hundreds 
of hours of old radio shows on it and I would just put one of those CD in my car player and just listen to 
those while I was delivering mail. You know, they're like from the 30s, 40s, 50s. 
 
EH: Like Gunsmoke--like that kind of thing? 
 
SH: Oh yeah. Gunsmoke's a great one. For some reason I had like a challenge. I listened to every episode 
of the Jack Benny Show. And he has hundreds and hundreds of episodes. But you know, I've got several 
hours a day where I'm just listening to stuff. So I listened to every Jack Benny Show, which was neat 
because it goes through like World War II and all that, you know, and they make a lot of mention of 
World War II in those old shows. And then Gunsmoke's newer than that. But it's, Gunsmoke and Dragnet, 
you listen to those and you listen to like where they try to do--this doesn't have anything to do with the 
rural carriers--but like they'll try to do like dramatized podcasts now where they're trying to act out a 
show and they just have no idea. You know, compared to Dragnet, right? You listen to Dragnet, you're 
just hanging on every word trying to see what's gonna happen next, or Suspense or Escape--those are all 
really good ones. But I went through... 
 
EH: Yeah. Oh go ahead. 
 
SH: Have you listened to those old radio shows?  
 
EH: Well, when I lived in DC there was The Big Broadcast on Sundays and they would do an episode of 
Jack Benny, and episode of Gunsmoke, an episode of Dragnet. I think Dragnet was my favorite. 
 
SH: Yeah. 
 
EH: But yeah, we did get into some BBC radio dramas--like Lovecraftian, and they do it right. 
 
46:24  
 
Some of the other ones I've listened to are kind of corny but this one was very suspenseful and kept our 
interest on a long drive, so. 
 
SH: Yeah! 
 
EH: I'll send it to you if you're interested. 
 
SH: Sure! I like the BBC ones. I don't listen to the BBC as much because they're more protective of 
theirs. Like the old Gunsmokes and all you can download those from that archive.org, there's no problem 
getting all those. But the BBC ones, they're a little more protective of their rights, I think. They're harder 
to get hold of those. But I can't think of all the ones I've listened to. But then, now I more listen to 
different podcasts like science podcasts, things like that. I listen to Marc Maron. You probably have 
listened to him, haven't you? 
 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022 
16 
 
EH: Yeah, yep. Cool. 
 
SH: (laughs) I was hoping you'd have a little garage--you'd be sitting in there like him. (laughs) But you 
have a nice little room there. 
 
EH: No, just my office. (laughs) Yeah. 
 
SH: Good. 
 
EH: What would you say is your favorite part of the job? 
 
SH: Probably just, honestly just being by myself and doing what I'm supposed to do, just putting the mail 
in the boxes, and going up to people's houses and used to it was more like, you drop something off and 
someone would be there, you used to be able to say hi and all. But now we're just such, we have so many 
packages. We just have hundreds of packages a day. So unless they really want, seem like they want to 
talk to you, I'm just like, "Hey, here you go." I've just got to go because I've just got so much work to do, 
you know. So I don't like that part. But as far as what I like, you're kinda on your own, you know, if you 
get stuck in a ditch, you work for a half hour or so and get yourself out. If you go to deliver a package, 
like oh no, I missed a package, you just take 10 minutes and drive back and drop it off and go back and 
just no one there to say "Oh, why did you miss that package? What's wrong with you? Why did you do 
that?" right? So I like that part, just being on my own and working. But then I like a little bit of being with 
the people that I know and like at the post office. And the customers that I like. So mostly I'd say, 
probably just you're a little more independent than I would picture some jobs, you know. Or other jobs 
I've had in the past, right? So. 
 
48:54  
 
EH: Have you ever had any concern over your safety on the route? 
 
SH: Well, other than just like maybe traffic issues, things like that. I'm not, I've never had any problem 
(coughs). Sorry. I still have that cough!  
 
EH: Yeah. 
 
SH: I've never really had problems with people on my route, probably because I'm a guy and all. And you 
know, for someone that I don't like I just, there's one, well, there's one guy that seems to go out of his way 
to cause problems, right? So I just, he has dogs that he lets loose on me, things like that. So I just zoom up 
in his driveway, lean out the window, lay his package on the edge of his driveway, zoom back, and take 
off before I even see him, right? So I just kind of avoid those people, where other people I'll more try to 
say hi to, chat with them and all. Some people have, especially the, a couple girls you know, the 
customers have I'd say harassed them, you know? So, they have had a problem with that. Seems like 
mostly the girls. But it's more like, you know with 500 people on your route, more than 500, because 
there's just 500 families and each family has several members in it. You might get some kind of crazy 
person there, you know? And you are like, on some of the routes like my daughter's, you're miles away 
from anyone.  
 
EH: Right, right.

Interview with Steven Honaker – 2/6/2022

SH: But they all seem to have handled it well. There's one lady especially--I'm going to try to get her to 
talk to you.  
 
EH: Oh cool! 
 
SH: She might do it. Most people, I don't think they would be interested. But I'll mention it to her 
specifically.  
 
EH: That would be cool. 
 
SH: Whenever you're finished, I want to ask you what would be the best way for them to contact you, or 
for you to contact them. 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah, definitely! 
 
50:53  
 
SH: Okay. 
 
EH: Yeah, I'll give you my contact info. 
 
SH: As far as being problems, it's mostly just safety due to the traffic issues, things like that. And partly 
because if you're in any kind of an accident, which I've been in a few, the post office just immediately 
says you've done something wrong. There for a while, they would say if there's any accident, it is your 
fault. You did it. We've told you not to get in an accident, you got in an accident, it's your fault, right?  
 
EH: Oh no. Yeah. 
 
SH: That's more problem than the actual something might happen. But on my route as far as the gravel 
trucks go down my route a lot. This is like a side note, but the weight limit on 2-lane ordinary paved roads 
is higher than the weight limit on the interstate. So they could take the gravel truck down the interstate, 
but they're overloaded, so they drive down this little 2-lane paved road. But I just keep an eye on my 
rearview mirror when I'm there and if I see any kind of gravel truck, I just, like a rabbit, I just dart off into 
someone's driveway or something to let that gravel truck go by. So that's as far as physical danger, you 
know, traffic problems. But most of my route is country roads, which I'm pretty comfortable on. And as 
far as like from other people, I haven't had any problem, but other people have had a problem with 
customers harassing them about different things. 
 
EH: Do you mark your car with rural carrier signs or lights or anything? 
 
SH: Oh yeah. We're required to have a marking of some kind and I just got some magnetic signs that they 
blow off pretty badly, but I've just got some magnetic signs. And I have some like bright flashing lights 
on top and I've made sure, especially with the gravel trucks, I got some really, really bright flashing 
lights. I've had people pull over when I was behind them because they thought I was some kind of police 
vehicle. 
 
EH: Oh yeah! 
 
53:06

SH: But I got really bright flashing lights. One time I was making a left-hand turn and someone hit me 
from behind. Another time I was parked and someone backed up into me. So even with those bright 
flashing lights, you know, if someone's determined to (laughs) ignore you, they will. 
 
EH: Yeah, right. Exactly. 
 
SH: But that's--I'm a pretty safe driver. Those are about the only times I've had any problems with getting 
hit. Which if you think you drive 50 miles a day, especially the whole stop and go aspect of it, because we 
have to stop right in the middle of the road, and you know, people are looking at their phones or 
something. So I've been pretty lucky.  
 
EH: That's good. Well, is there anything else you would like to share or that we haven't talked about? 
 
SH: Oh, I'll probably think of something as it goes along, but I can't think of it right now. (laughs) 
 
EH: Well thank you so much for talking with me and I can stop the recording and we can chat about 
maybe getting in touch with some other carriers you know. 
 
SH: Okay. Sure! 
 
EH: Thanks so much! 
 
SH: Well, it was nice to meet you! It was nice to talk to you. 
 
EH: Yeah, you too!
