PEANUTS, 
SUNG FOR TWO YE&RS BY B. C. HART, AT THE 
THEATRE COMIQIIE, CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
Tho' woman are a 
blessing, 
They often us deceive; 
Deception's found in every one, 
From our first mother, Eve. 
A 
maiden fair, with ginger hair, 
Who caught my heart, she tried, 
Eloped with another man 
Who at the corner cried— 
CHORDS. 
Peanuts, peanuts, 
Warm your hands, 
And eat your full of 
Peanuts, peanuts. 
Smoking in the car, 
I 
never thought that Milly, 
Would ever be so silly, 
To elope with a 
peanut man. 
One night I 
thought I'd treat her, 
To the theatre we went; 
The peanut man he stood outside, 
She seemed on mischief bent, 
Says she to me, now Billy dear, 
I'll just go to the door, 
She left me for to see peanuts, 
And I 
never saw her more. 
Chorus. 
Spoken; No she ran away with that infernal Pea-
nuts, and all that remained was a solitary lump of 
coke, which looked me up in the face as if it would 
say— 
Chorus.

°NMI TWORYI ZIC ZALL ZON. 
BY B. C. MEET. 
When I 
was a 
little girl, 
A 
game we used to play; 
The plerrant moments it recalls, 
I 
remember to this day. 
Jumping rope, and hie spy. 
It catches, we would shout, 
But the one that pleased me best of all, 
Was one, two, three, I'm out. 
Spoken; Yes, ladies and gentlemen, while at school 
I'll never forget those endearing games we used to 
play, this one in particular, 
CHORUS. 
Onery, twoery, zig, zall, zon, 
Fillesy, fallesy, nicklesy, John, 
Queery. quarey, English, nary, 
Sprinklum, spranklurn, buck, I'm out. 
And as I 
grew and older got, 
In company I 
did go, 
Of course, quite natural, fell to my lot, 
To catch a 
charming beau 
His name was Gaorge, a 
nice young man, 
To please he was not slow, 
He wanted to marry. my answer was, 
We'll see how the old song does go. 
Spoken. I 
says, Georgey, if the song says marry, 
all right. so I 
commenced at Georgey, Georgey, 
Chorus. 
I'm singing here to amuse you all, 
All classes I 
try to please, 
My du, da day, and many more, 
And the one which they call sneeze. 
But if you think I'll sing any more. 
Though, you may applause and shout, 
And many cry aloud encore, 
I'll count and see who's out. 
Spoken. 
Yes, gentlemen, we will go back to the 
school days °nod more, and see who gets out, you or 
me, now— 
Chorus.

STOOD IT LIKE A 
LAMB. 
AN ORIGINAL SONG, BY B. C. HINT. 
AIR; GRIMES' CELLAR DOOR. 
Some people talk of bygone days, 
But we all do know, 
That things ain't as they used to be, 
Some twenty years ago. 
The girls used put me to bed, 
As happy as a 
clam, 
But still I 
don't care a 
cent, 
I 
stood it like a 
lamb. 
Oh! yes, those days, 
Those good old days, 
With me and Sarah Ann, 
When we slid down the cellar door, 
I 
stood it like a 
lamb. 
At last the days rolled quickly by, 
We both did older grow; 
Sally and I 
did often play 
Hide and seek and lay low. 
She began to scare of me, 
As I 
grew to be a 
man, 
Says I, don't be frightened at 1116, dear, 
We'll stand it like a 
lamb. 
At last I 
am a 
married man, 
As happy as can be; 
The girls they don't come near me now, 
What's the reason I 
can't tell. 
I 
go around enjoy myself, 
Come home, say, here lam; 
My wife don't squeal or say a 
word, 
She stands it like a 
lamb. 
Chorus.

BOLIVAR BILL, 
AS SUNG BY B. C. HART. 
Bolivar Bill was a 
pea-nut man, 
And he'd a 
lovely daughter; 
Her eyes they looked like oyster shells, 
And her nose was as flat as a 
quarter. 
She was graceful as a 
cord of wood, 
Her feet was filled with bunions, • 
Her mouth was like the Maumee river 
Her breath was sweet as onions. 
CHORUS. 
Ta, ta, ta, ta, my baby dear, 
I'll meet you in the park, if you'll treat to lager beer, 
Now don't you think you see that you are rather queer, 
I 
think the best thing you can do, is 
Waltz off on your ear. 
'When dressed up in the latest style, 
We looked just like a 
clothes rack; 
With a 
horse's tail fnr a 
waterfall, 
And a 
dish-rag for a 
pin-back. 
With government shoes about nineteen, 
And a 
brick bat for a 
locket; 
A 
tin pan for a 
diamond ring, 
And a 
ham bone in her pocket. 
Chorus. 
She fell in love with a 
nice young man, 
And she tried his heart to slaughtel; 
His hair was green, his teeth was loose, 
And he peddles chalk and water. 
His nose looked like a 
big mushmelon, 
Puffed out from drinking booze; 
His feet looked like two salted hams. 
And his name was Over Shoes. 
Spoken.—Yes, and when he'd go up on Sundays to 
to see her, and she'd shake him, he used to say— 
CHORUS. 
Ta, ta, ta, ta, my lady dear, I'll meet you in the Park 
If you'll treat to lager beer, 
I'll fill you up with white clam shells, 
And I'll get you drunk on booze; 
The snide of all the ladies is Peaster Overshoes.

M,MANUS THE GAWK, 
RECITED BY B. C. HART. 
The theatre was full, and so was the actors, 
McManus was billed to appear; 
in a 
left handed, barefooted, left handed jig, 
For he was the Pompey round here. 
The bar-room was perfectly crowded with loafers, 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would eat when the lunch 
was give out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, and 
Shouted a 
loud hurrah ! 
When McManus kem out with young Oliver Twist, 
They gave him the cough, and yah ! yah ! 
Says he, ' I'm a 
prince," says a 
woman , " yer lie ! 
I 
know yer, yer one of the gang. 
And yer owe me for washing," that touched his gaul. 
And his breast on his head he did 'hang, 
A 
brick ! yes, it was, I 
saw McManus start, 
And something was wrong, I 
well knew. 
To see how he carromed upon the dark red, 
Continually dropping his cue. 
At last, he the footlights approached at a 
rush, 
And fellow free-lunchers he said, 
If I 
have not drawn bourbon enough here to-night, 
The fault is my wealth not my head. 
It's many the time I've made you all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer. 
When I 
walked O'Donnell a 
mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here, 
You insult me to-night and say I 
am sober, 
For yes, I'm a 
ham left alone. 
I'll tell yer the reason I'm sure you will treat, 
Y've a 
mother-in-law dead drunk at home. 
THE EMPTY SLEEVES 
VT MICHAEL SCANLAN. 
RECITED BY B. C. HART. 
(A soldier seeking employment in one of the public 
departments, being asked " who were his backers," 
pointed to his empty sleeve.) 
You ask me by whose favored names, 
I 
sue for grace to earn my bread? 
Good sir, I 
base my humble claims, 
Not on the living, but the dead! 
My story's one of honest blood; 
I 
cannot spin fine threads nor weave 
Fair lies into apparent good; 
My backing is my empty sleeve! 
When Peac3 fled cowering, thro' the land, 
And War had drawn his vizor down, 
When Fratricide with blade and brand 
Went roaming, red-lipped up and down, 
I 
clutched my rifle from the wall, 
Nor paused to beg some Magnate's leave, 
And followed Freedom's bugle call, 
'My bounty was this empty sleeve ? 
Oft have I 
paced the moonlit snows, 
The foenian's challenge in mine ear, 
And with each dawn of battle rose 
Unawed, tho' Death was standing near; 
Where shrieking carnage madly tore 
Our serried ranks from morn till eve, 
When Rapidan ran red with gore, 
'Twas there I 
won my empty sleeve! 
I. 
THE EMPTY SLEEVE. 
CONTINUED. 
Indorsement ! see across my cheek-
A 
saber slash at Malvern Hill— 
Blood-red and deep ! does that not speak 
More eloquent than palsied guile ? 
And this—'twas on a 
death long charge--
Plumb thro' the breast ! Feel and believe! 
Dumb honors those not worn at large— 
Reserves to back my empty sleeve! 
But nature cast my soul too wide, 
To fit the politician's plan, 
I 
fought with patriotic pride, 
And voted like an honest man ! 
But glory is a 
withered bough, 
The ballot brit a 
make-heleive ! 
Two knavish hands are better now 
Than honor and an empty tz,eeve! 
One hour of throbbing war outweighs, 
With all its mad sublimity; 
A cycle of these plotting days 
Where cunning crowds out chivalry— 
When like a 
beggar one must wait, 
With honor's sears, from ni ,•rn till eve, 
That shoddy at his golden gate 
May patronize the empty sleeve ! 
Oh ! happy they whose souls went forth 
Upon the battle's rushing breath, 
The fair hands of the glowing 2.';ortli 
Bestrewed their royal roads to death! 
And better sleep in hallowed earth 
Than, scattered thus, to mope and grieve, 
The low esteem for manly worth, 
E'en gloried with an empty sleeve ! 
Base thoughts avaunt ! l'll stand erect, 
For all the dead march by my side ! 
Mp soul shall hold its self-respect 
E'en tho' my country's thith has died, 
E'en tho' the privilege of place 
Is me denied, I 
still believe 
There's beauty in the war- scarred face, 
And honor in the empty sleeve.

THE TRAMP. 
ILEGTTED BY FRANK LITM. 
Lawns sit down a 
minute, a 
stone's got in my shoe, 
Don't you commence your cusin,' I 
ain't done 
nothin' to you; 
Yes, I'm a 
tramp. 
What of it ? 
Folks say we 
ain't no good, 
But tramps has to live, I 
reckon, though 
folks don't think that we should. 
Once I 
was strong and handsome, had plenty 
of cash and clothes, 
That was afore I 
tippled, and gin got into my nose, 
Down in the Lehigh Valley me and my people grew, 
I 
was a 
blacksmith, cap'n—and a 
good one, too; 
Me and my wife and Nellie. 
Nellie was just sixteen, 
She was the pootiest creeter the valley had ever seen. 
Beaux ? why, she had a 
dozen—had 'em from 
near and far, 
But they were mostly farmers, none of 'ern suited her, 
There was a 
city stranger, young handsome, and tall, 
Dam him—I 
wish I 
had him strangled agin that wall, 
He was the man for Nellie—she didn't know no ill; 
Mother, she tried to stop it, but you know 
a 
young gal's will, 
Well it's the same old story—common enough you'll say, 
lie was a 
soft-tongued devil, and got her to run away, 
More than a 
month or after, we heard from the 
poor young thing. 
He'd gone away and left her without a 
wedding ring, 
Back to her home we brought her, back to her 
mothers side, 
Filled with a 
raging fever, she fell at my 
feet and died, 
Frantic with shame and trouble, her mother 
began to sink, 
Dead—in less than a 
fortnight—that's when 
I 
took to drink, 
Gimme one glaaa, Curnel, and then I'll be on my way, 
ru tramp till I 
find that scoundrel, if it takes 
till Judgement Day,

GOOD FOR NOTHING NANCY, 
AS DONE BY MISS AMELIA DEAN. 
Folks call me good for nothing Nancy, 
But I 
don't know why they should, 
I 
never does much harm, although, 
I 
never does much good. 
They try to keep me quiet 
But you know they never can, 
For I'd rather romp than work, becos, 
I'm good for nothing Nan. 
Citoims. 
For I'm good for nothing Nancy, 
So the people say; 
Hard work is not my fancy, 
I'd rather be at play. 
They try to keep me quiet, 
But you know they never can, 
I'd rather romp than work, 
Because I'm good for nothing Nan. 
I 
gits up in the morning, 
And I 
goes and lights the fire, 
And has a 
talk across the way 
Along with old Sophia 
I 
then goes out to meet the boys, 
And gives them plenty of cheek; 
And has a 
game of whipping top, 
Hop Sc ,tch, and hide-a-seek. 
The landlord's son the other day, 
Come here to get his rent; 
As I 
was chucking up some mud, 
Right on his hat it went. 
He told me that he'd lock me up, 
I 
gave him such a 
whack, 
And in the row his Sunday clothes 
Got torn right off his back. 
Chorus.

A GOD AFTER ALL, 
AT THE BOARD OF EXAMINERS FOR PRIZE DECLAMATIONS, 
MISS AMELIA. DEAN, WAS AWARDED THE FIRST PRIZE OF 
$100,00 FOR THE RECITATION OF THE FOLLOWING. 
We laid in a 
cold cell Mr. Judge, all night long, 
Jimmie and me, waitin' and wishin' for the 
morning's dawns 
Cause we couldn't sleep, Mister Judge, in 
that cold damp place. 
And Jimmie was most scared to death, by the 
wild, mad race 
That the rats kept runnin' all through the:dark night; 
That's why we're glad, Mr. Judge, to see the daylight. 
Please, Mr. Judge, we are not very bad little beys, 
And the policeman what took us said we're 
some mother's joys, 
He was wrong, Mr. Judge, and should only have said 
That we are two little outcasts, and our mother is dead, 
And there's no one to care for us, at least here below. 
And no roof that shelters us from the rain and 
the snow. 
A 
preacher once told us that way up in the blue, 
There was a 
God that was watching all that 
little boys do, 
And that He loved little children, and His love 
was free; 
—15— 
A GOD AFTER ALL, 
CONTINUED. 
But I 
guess, Mr. Judge, He don't love Jimmie or me; 
For I 
prayed, and I 
prayed till I 
was most out 
of breath, 
For smething to eat, and. to keep Jimmie from death. 
And that's why we're here, Mister Judge; for 
you know, 
There was no help from above, I 
must find it below; 
'Twas no use beggin' and be told in God I 
must trust. 
For I'd begged all the day and got never a 
crust; 
And there was pcor Jimmie, holdin' his 
cold little feet, 
And cryin' and moanin' for somethin to eat. 
So I 
went to a 
house that was not very far, 
And saw, Mr. Judge, that the back door was ajar: 
And a 
table was settin' right close to the door, 
Just loaded with pies, about twenty or more. 
So quickly I "slipped in and grabbed one to my breast— 
The policeman then caught us, and you know the rest. 
Discharged, did you say, Mister Judge ? 
both Jimmie and I 
And—we ain't got to be jailed ' cause I 
took a 
pie ? 
And we can eat what we want?—how funny 'twill seem— 
Say, Jimmie, pinch me, for I— I 
think it's a 
dream, 
And you'll give us work, summer, winter and fall— 
Say, Jimmie I 
I 
think there's a 
God after all.

SOMEBODY'S MOTHER. 
RECITED BY GUS WILLIAMS, 
The woman was old and raged and gray, 
And bent with the chill of a 
winter's day; 
The streets were white with recent snow, 
And the woman's feet were aged and slow. 
At the crowded crossing she waited long. 
Jostled aside by the careless throng 
Of human beings who passed her by, 
Unheeding the glance of her anxious eye. 
Down the street with laughter and shout. 
Glad in the freedom of " school let out," 
Come happy boys, like a 
flock of sheep, 
Hailing the snow piled white and deep, 
Past the woman so old and gray, 
hastened the children on their way. 
None offered a 
helping hand to her, 
So weak and timid afraid to stir, 
Lest the carriage wheels or the horses feet 
Should trample her down in the slippery street 
At last came out of the merry troop, 
The gayest boy of all the group; 
He paused beside her, and whispered low. 
" 
I'll help you across if you wish to go ?" 
Her aged hand on his strong young arm 
She placed, and so without hurt or harm, 
He guided the trembling feet along, 
Proud that his own were young and strong; 
Then back again to his friends he went, 
His young heart happy and well content, 
" 
She's somebody's mother, boys, you know. 
For all she's aged, and poor and slow; 
And someone, sometime, may lend a 
hand. 
To help my mother — you understand ! 
If ever she's poor and old and gray, 
And her own dear boy is far away." 
"Somebody's mother." bowed low her head, 
In her home flint night, and the prayer she sal. 
Was; " God be kind to that noble boy, 
Who is somebody's son and pride and joy." 
Faint was the voice, and V, orn and weak, 
But Heaven lists when its chosen speak; 
Angels caught the faltering word, 
And " Somebody's mother's" prayer was heard,

TAR ON THE HEEL. 
Br JAB. T. KELLY, FOR KELLY & O'BRIEN, AND PERFORMED 
BY THEM wrrn GREAT SUCCESS. 
While running down the street one afternoon, 
For to catch a 
butter-fly, 
I 
jammed my heal into a 
big spittoon, 
Oh ! how is that for high. 
Kiser don't you want to buy a 
dog, 
Or a 
sixteen karat pin; 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows, 
With a 
bunion on her shin. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! my. you can't catch me, (Break,)

Oh! how is that for low.

MLA 
GARFIELD'S GRAVE. 
TO THE CITIZENS OF CLEVELAND, OHIO. 
With steady step, and muffled drum," 
The cortege passed along; 
And dreaded silence reigned supreme 
Amid the mighty throng. 
The somber tolling of the bells, 
Reminded us in time we must 
Just like our President, 
Return from dust to dust. 
Men with heads uncovered, 
Would matter Guitads name; 
And the wishes of each one, 
I 
am certain were the same. 
And if from jail he once were free, 
No power on earth could save 
The man that sent our President 
To his untimely grave. 
We saw the streets in mourning, 
Which ever way you would go; 
And every one their sympathy 
In some way tried to show. 
Many a 
wife and mother, 
A 
fervent prayer has said, 
And taught it to their little ones 
Before they went to bed. 
And when the sufferer was laid 
In his last resting place, 
Then came an aged colered man, 
With the tears running down his face, 
He bought a 
little bouquet, 
With a 
card marked Uncle Dave, 
He said it was all he had to give 
For Master Gartield's grave. 
How sad it is, indeed, to see 
His patient hopeful wife, 
And and gray haired mother, 
For him she would give her life, 
How different their feelings were, 
While about him they did stand; 
When honored with the highest place, 
There is in our free land. 
Let us hope that his successor, 
Will be as fit to rule, and be a 
man 
That can't be made the politician's tool, 
So peaceful rest the ashes of our soldier, 
True and brave, and our nation's tears 
Will moist the earth on James A Garfield's Grave.

LAKE SHORE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY FILLNX LUX 
I 
am going to sing a 
funny song, 
And the subject is not very long, 
It's all about the funny sights, 
On the lake shore on a 
Sunday night, 
Such droves of people I 
declare. 
From five till ten, are walking there, 
All other streets deserted quite, 
For the Lake Shore on a 
Sunday night. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! if you doubt then what I 
say, 
Go yourself most any day, 
Go yourself and see the sights, 
On the lake shore on Sunday night. 
There are bachelors gay sporting away, 
Laughing and talking with maidens gay, 
And old maids you will often find 
With little poodle dogs behind, 
Oh! don't they one another squeeze, 
It's when they feel the evening breeze, 
If the stars could speak tell tales they might, 
Of Lake View Park on Sunday night. 
Chong, 
I'll tell you what me most annoys, 
It is to see so many naughty boys, 
Running around with common cigars, 
When they should be home with their 
pa's and magi 
And young girls scarce sixteen years old, 
Running around them so bold, 
And doing things that isn't right, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night, 
Chorus. 
Young widows tired of single life, 
Wishing to become again a 
wife, 
Are trying with many a 
wicked leer, 
To catch a 
stylish husband dear. 
And gay young sports a 
strolling along, 
Singing " Maggie Gordon" or some love song, 
With sweethearts under their arm so tight, 
On the Lake Shore on Sunday night. 
Ckersa.

MY OPINION STILL 
SUNG BY FRANK JONES. 
You see before you a 
specimin 
Of an independent nigger. 
A 
happy-go-lucky son of a 
gun, 
No matter come what will. 
I 
always said if the colored folks 
Had stuck to the old plantation, 
They'd have been better off to-day, 
And that's my opinion still. 
The world gets wiser every day, 
At least the people say so, 
Humanity is struggling 
Their purses for to fill. 
I 
always said if the rich man, 
Would change place with the poor man, 
He'd know the value of a 
loaf of bread, 
And that's my opinion still. 
Now Beecher had a 
terrible time, 
In that beautiful city of Brooklyn, 
The Tiltons and Moultons with Bessie to 
Would make a 
healthy pill. 
They ought to go to Salt Lake city, 
And there get reconstructed, 
For they've always been a 
public bore, 
And that's my opinion still. 
Now boys I 
guess I've said enough, 
On this august occasion, 
I'd sooner have your friendship, 
Than carry your ill will. 
I 
thought when I 
began to sing this song, 
I'd have to sing another, 
But whether I 
am right or whether I'm wrong, 
It's my opinion still.

MULCAHEYIS WIFE IS DRUNK. 
RECITATION. 
BY JAS. RICHMOND, FOR KELLY & 
O'BRIEN. 
The town is full of excitement, 
They dress in their Sunday clothes, 
It cannot be a 
holiday, 
What's the matter no one knows, 
Business is suspended. 
The people all converse, 
It cannot be a 
funeral, 
For I 
see no coach or horse, 
The police all act suspicious, 
See the Mayor come this way, 
There must have been some trouble, 
For not a 
soul feels gay. 
Haste and make inquiries, 
Courage boy, have spunk, 
Colonel what's the matter ? 
Why Mulcahey's wife is drunk.

ALL BROKE UP. 
COMIC BANJO SOLO. 
WRITTEN & SUNG BY CHAS. OLTDDZW. 
COPYRIGHT 1881, BY MRS. PAULINE LIEDZI. 
When I 
was a 
lad about sixteen, 
I 
travelled with a 
circus and sold ice cream; 
I 
polished up the handle of the elephants trtutk. 
And slept in a 
cage with a 
big sick monk. (Break) 
I 
done my work in such a 
rage, 
They made me ruler of the monkey's cage; 
I 
fed them on the European plan, 
And they got so weak they could not stand. 
When the show would commence, I'd watch for beat*. 
With a 
club I'd sail round under the seats; 
My legs got crooked and my back got bent, 
Watching for kids sneaking under the tent. 
(Break. 
I 
said " what, never," to a 
mule in fun, 
And got kicked through the roof of the big bass dm*, 
It wasn't the fall that made me kick, 
But stopping quite so sudden made me sick. 
They brought me to, with a 
kerosene pump, 
And the doctor said I 
was off my chump, 
They laid me out on the trick mule's back, • 
And I 
went through the roof when he took up 
the slack. 
(
Break.) 
Came down head first, and went clean through a 
dray, 
The horse got frightened and he ran away; 
My voice got broke and my face got scarred. 
And now I'm door-tender in a 
big grave yard.

I 
know a 
little girl, the best in all the world, 
Her equal is not living in the land; 
She promised to be mine, she's happiness divine, 
And said that I 
could have her heart and hand. 
I 
met her on the street the other day, 
I 
tell you she looked grand, 
When I 
saw her I 
thought I'd faint away, 
Such a 
feeling I 
couldn't understand.

I 
tell you honey she's just grand, 
You can bet your bottom dollar, 
She's the finest in the land. 
Her folks are satisfied that she should be my bride, 
So now we will get married right away. 
We invite you one and all to come and make a 
call, 
Whenever you come along our way, 
We'll take down the fiddle and bones, 
And make the banjo ring; 
And dance as we often did before, 
That good old Mississippi wing.

HARP AND THE SHAMROCK GREENS 
SUNG BY T. WALSH, OF WALSH & DEMPSEY. 
We are Irishmen born, and proud for to own it, 
We love that dear island so green; 
'Tis acknowledged by all the home of the bravo. 
And its daughters are fair to be seen. 
In battle, her sons stand bold and undaunted, 
As oft they have proved when put to the test; 
Their life's blood they'd give defending the banner, 
That floats o'er the beautiful isle of the West. 
Caonus. 
Success to the boys that comes from dear Erin, 
They are braver than lions, the best ever seen, 
In battle they prove themselves loyal and daring, 
And true to the harp and the shamrock so green. 
In peace they're the jolliest boys in the wide world, 
To the poor their roof they would share, 
With a 
hearty God speed to those that's in need, 
Should they visit that dear isle so fair. 
And soon may that bright little gem of the ocean, 
Rank with all other nations in this world 
that is free, 
Proud hearts will beat light for the land they 
love best, 
Then Paddy contented and happy will be.

To dance a

And her statue she will bring, 
And I'll be there if I

IT WAS THE CAT, 
--3 1— 
RECITED BY KELLY & O'BRIEN. 
The boy stood on the edge of a 
razor, 
Trying to have his toes; 
He was throwing bricks at his little sister, 
And balancing eggs upon his nose. 
His father's lead pipe was all cut up, 
To make bullets for the Fourth of July; 
But when his father found it out, 
He made him a 
present of a 
lovely black eye, 
Little Mikey swore he'd be revenged, 
And kept up to his belief; 
So he killed the cat for supper one night, 
And told the family it was corn beef. 
They all took sick and nearly died 
From the ugly grease and fat, 
And when the doctor asked who done it, 
He said, " be heavens it was the cat." 
Little Angey, that's Mikey's sister, 
Clothed in silken rags; 
Stood silently a-whispering 
Stale, but original gags. 
Mikey seized her by the wish bone, 
Because there war a 
rise. sir, 
He exclaimed without a 
flash pan, 
All on account of Eliza.

PAT MAY BE FOOLISH. 
CORRECT EDITION. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth, 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Pat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock growl. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tears, 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
field, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Chorus% 
Remember the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come test him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
Is not fit for a 
country or queen.

Shure I'm a 
high-toned 'ristocra, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I 
take the stand, 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
CHORUS. 
He's well educated and toney. 
His influence is great, 
Shure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Malonsy. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool, 
But if the boys make fun of ins. 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land, 
fio if you want an honest friend. 
Then Maloney is the man.

When I

It was death in every tone. 
They have told you some false stories, 
You believed them all they say ; 
You are false, but I'll forgive you,

You are false, but I'd forgive you, 
But forget you I

Turn aside, how can it be? 
You have left nie for another, 
You have turned from me away ;

You are false, but I'll forgive you,

Of a 
pretty Irish girl, her teeth as bright as pearls, 
And such rosy cheeks, I 
never saw before; 
Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars 
at night, 
Sure she is the only girl that I adore. 
She is like the birds of May, singing all the day, 
And her like I'm sure that you have never seen; 
Mary Ellen, that's her name, she lives down in the lane, 
And I 
call her my pretty Irish Queen. 
CHORUS. 
My pretty, my pretty, my pretty Irish Queen, 
Her eyes they are so bright, they shine like stars

Mary Ellen that's her name, and she lives down 
in the lane, 
And I

• 
You should see my pretty pearl, as she's skipping 
to the welL 
With her little water pail upon her arm, 
With her lovely flowing hair, arrah, with her 
none can compare. 
And all the Irish hearts she does charm. 
Next Sunday night at eight, down by the garden gate, 
ni present her with a 
wedding ring; 
And happy'll be the day, when to the church 
we will away, 
And I'll marry my pretty Irish Queen.

In eighteen hundred and sixty one, 
The war it first broke out; 
The poor unfortunate Irishmen 
Were scattered all about. 
The rich man would not go and fight, 
But for the poor ones they did hutt-; 
Then hand in hand to Dixie's land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
Cnouus. 
Then give a 
cheer for we Yankee boys, 
For the enemy we must hunt, 
So hand in hand to Dixie's Land, 
Went the Irishmen to the front. 
When we got on board the train, 
We had not been long gone; 
Until we found our enemy; 
Were about ten thousand strong. 
We sent back telegraph despatches, 
And such time was never made, 
When Gen McClellan our little Mac, 
Led on the Irish Brigade. 
Chorus. 
So now me Yankee comrades, 
Don't harm an Irishman, 
For,Paddies door is open for you, 
With a 
warm and welcome hand. 
I 
hope the day is not very far off, 
When old Ireland shall have her rights, 
And that little green banner float in victory, 
Along with the Stars and Stripes.

IT DON'T BELONG TO ME. 
'When I 
was but a 
little child I 
used to go to school, 
And there I 
was so very good, they thought I 
was a 
fool; 
Because I 
never claimed a 
thing that didn't belong to me, 
For I 
was just as honest and as truthful as could be. 
While walking cut the other day by a 
police man 
I 
was stopped, 
He says young man this piece of gold just from 
your pocket dropped; 
But as I 
never carried one, and had but little coin, 
Like an honest boy I 
did reply the purse it is not mine. 
CHORUS. 
No it don't belong to me, it don't belong to me, 
You had better inquire of somebody higher, 
it don't belong to me, 
I 
never saw the purse before, it can't be mine you see, 
know nothing whatever about the purse, 
it don't belong to me. 
My wages being very small I 
live in humble style, 
But with the girls I 
lardy dah, among the great and fine 
I 
tell them almost anything, for I 
have plenty cheek, 
But little they think I 
do the swell upon fire 
dollars a 
week. 
The other day I 
bought a 
pie, I 
placed it in my hat, 
I 
saw a 
lady on the street, I 
knew she'd stop to chat, 
My hat blew off, the pie fell out, the little boys 
laughed with glee, 
'11.t when they brought it back I 
said it don't 
belong to me. 
Chorus. 
I 
occupy an attic room in a 
street away up town, 
And in the next there lives a 
girl her name is 
Nelly Brows, 
Whenever I 
get a 
chance to talk or pass the time away, 
I 
have a 
little gossiping in a 
quiet sort of way. 
As I 
came home the other night oh ! what a 
dreadful scene, 
The landlord rushing after me saying, Bill, 
what does tis mean, 
Miss Brown has left behind this infant as you see, 
Says I, you quite surprise me, sir, but it don't 
belong to me.

ONLY THE WAY ON THE STAGE. 
By Fred J. Mackley. 
Sung by Henry Graham. 
If you will listen to me some facts I 
will mention, 
Concerning the past and the present strange age, 
And in them, my friends, to you I'll relate 
Some things I 
saw one night and played on the stage. 
I 
came to this city with one or two friends, 
And went for a 
stroll, they seemed quite amazed, 
When we read on the bills of the Bowery Theatre, 
And found a 
new drama was played on the stage. 
The first scene I 
saw was a 
street in New York, 
There a 
poor woman begging, she quiet old in age, 
Those sad means she tried to keep her from starving, 
A 
very sad lesson of life's book a 
page ; 
But a 
policeman passed by, his face seemed in smiles, 
Placed hishend in his pocket and drew forth his wagest, 
And he gave part to help this poor wretched woman, 
But ' twas only the way it was played on the stage. 
The scene it then changed from a 
street to a 
court room, 
There a 
prisoner on trial for a 
crime very sad, 
He'd murdered a 
man by the people respected, 
And the court room was crowded with people so glad, 
To see that lean punished for the crime he commuted, 
The jury looked stsrn, and the judge in a 
rage, 
And they hung that rich man for the murder of Fisk, 
But it was only the way it wai played on the stage. 
in the neIr scene I 
saw a 
clergyman from Brooklyn, 
Who was,dancing a 
hornpipe, and seemed quite the rage, 
Another one fiom Jersey was playing the violin, 
The audience in front with wonderment gazed. 
For just at that minute a 
party named Tilton 
Then gave a 
fine aermon on the morals of the age, 
And I 
thought that that they practiced each 
sermon they preaels44, 
Dit it was only the w.ty it wae played on the stage.

I'm an old man now, as you can see,

But of all I

For he ain't fast 'ceptin' he am hit,

But he am faithful, good and kind, 
And that am more dan gold.

Nor cuts up any shines,

For me that poor soul pines;

At ten o'clock, precisely, 
We had to close the door; 
It was crowded to suffocation, 
And it could not hold no more. 
There was ninety-seven couples 
Round the hall did promenade-
2/1d Ireland was represented 
At Kerrigan's Masquerade! 
Kerrigan was dressed, I 
do declare, 
Regardless of expense, 
He waxed his moustache up with soap, 
Ile fairly looked immense. 
Ins hair was tarred with axel grease, 
He had a 
five cent shave; 
It would make you die when to waltz he tried,

The night of the masquerade.

My name is O'Brien from Harlem, 
An Irishman as you can see, 
can sing like a 
thrush or a 
starling, 
Or the little bird up in a 
tree. 
But the gang that stands there on the corner 
Are trying the steps and the dance, 
And they shout out whenever I'm passing, 
There's O'Brien with his high water pants. 
CHORUS. 
They tell me to go over to England, 
And pay a 
short visit to France, 
And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And call them the high water pants. 
Last week I 
went to the theatre, 
Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nager came out with a 
banjo. 
He played up a 
highland clog dance, 
And he gave out a 
gag and con-nun-drum, 
'Bout O'Brien with his high-water pants. 
Oho 
One night I 
strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a 
friend Paddy Brock, 
We tho t 
we'd just drop into Geoglian's. 
To try some of his rye and rock. 
When the gang all cried, there's Dan O'Leary, 
The bar-tender shot me a 
glance, 
Rowld your tongues," then said he to the loafers, 
That's O'Brien with his high-water pants.

Now since I 
appear here before you once more, 
I'll endeavor to gain your fair smile, 
Tho' years now have passed since I 
left the old shore, 
I 
still cling to the dear native isle. 
.11A1 I'll sing of old Ireland, the land of my birth, 
I 
will sing of the great men that's been, 
;Those deeds of renown shall shine round each heart 
They were great men that Ireland has seen. 
CHORUS. 
Then here's to the sons of old Et 
Go Bragh, 
May the memory of their names still be green, 
On sea, or on coast, let us drink off this toast, 
To the great men that Ireland has seen. 
O'Connell you know, as all history does show, 
Was a 
statesman; whose equal was few, 
At the great Parliament, he did often represent, 
That the wrongs of old Ireland were true. 
And Emmet the martyr, he fought for our cause, 
Like a 
laurel his name it keeps green, 
He died for his country and Liberty's laws, 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
,k_nd then we had Sarsfield who conquered each foe, 
And never was known for to yield, 
The foemam would quake, aye, and tremble and shake, 
When his war horse would enter the field; 
And then as for poets there is no land I'm sure, 
Where such brilliant genius has been, 
There was Grattan and Lover, and famous Tom Moore; 
Those were great men that Ireland has seen. 
Cho. 
But though those great men have now passed away, 
Old Erin shall not be alone, 
We hove men that would die for their country to-day, 
And a 
parliament wish of their own; 
But may God guide and guard them to do what is right, 
May they harbor no rancor or spleen, 
But when honor demands them they valiantly fight, 
Like the great men that Ireland has seen.

THE PATTER OF THE SHINGLE. 
RECITED BY JOE HART. . 
When the angry passion gathering 
In my mother's face I 
see; 
And she leads me to the bed-chamber, 
Gently lays me on her knee. 
Then I 
know that I 
will catch it, 
And my flesh in fancy itches, 
As I 
listen to the patter 
Of the shingle on my breeches. 
Every tinkle of the shingle, 
Has an echo and a 
sting, 
And a 
thousand burning fancies 
Into active being spring. 
And a 
thousand bees and hornets, 
Beneath my coat-tail seem to swarm, 
And 1 
feel the patter 
Of the shingle, oh! so warm. 
In a 
sudden intermision, 
Which appears my only chance, 
I 
say strike gently, mother, 
Or you'll split my Sunday panls. 
She stops a 
moment, draws her breath, 
The shingle holds aloft, 
And says, I 
had not thought of that, . 
My son just take them breeches off. 
Holy Moses and the angels, 
Cast your pittying glances down, 
An you, good family doctor, 
Put a 
good soft poultice on. 
And may I 
with fools and dunces 
Everlastingly mingle, 
if I 
ever say another word, 
When my mother wields the shingle.

I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild. 
And the stream e'er flowed by- the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes bloW 
And we played ' neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster hen rd us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring, 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
When we played on the turnpike gate.

A 
ROW OF TENEMENT HOUSES. 
SUNG BY NILES & EVANS. 
AIR: BLUE ALSATIAN MOUNTAINS. 
In a 
row of tenement houses, 
Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young andlair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
! 
he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy, 
So she called her yaller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his trouses, 
For the dog to chew .bat day.

Over the floor we gracefully slide, 
In the Boehton dip and the Ilobokes glide,

In the ball soon envy me,

At the Finegin Corterie.

When the gong for supper is rang, 
You will find us in the van; 
She brushes the soup from my whialnem 
With her ten cent Japanese fan.

But the turkey give to me, 
When we ate our fill we'll dance until 
The end of the Corterie.

CHICAGO IN SLICES, 
SUNG BY FRANK RUM. 
I 
have been to the north and been to the south, 
In traveling a 
man may a-far go, 
To the jumping off place before you will find 
A 
city to compare with Chicago. 
If you never have altered 'your name in your life, 
Or never did up to a 
bar go, 
Or never run away with another man's wife, 
They won't let you live in Chicago. 
Some folks send by Adams express, 
And others put faith in old Fargo; 
But if you won't to go to the devil direct, 
Just enter yourself for Chicago. 
The city with fast gals and gay gamboliers, 
Is as full as a 
ship with a 
Cargo, 
And it's truthfully said that the very best men, 
Fight chickens and dogs in Chicago. 
The infants they feed on whiskey direct, 
And for liquor they to their ma's go; 
And the muly cows give, as some might expect, 
Whiskey punch in the town of Chicago, 
They won't let the ministers live in the town, 
For on him they will put an embargo, 
Unless he drinks wine with all his young friends, 
And then he may stay in Chicago. 
The men they play at faro and poker, 
And the most of them to tho war did go; 
And they sang that good song of the bonnie blue flag. 
All night in the streets of Chicago. 
Some might say their morals are bad, 
Or that they too far below par do go, 
But the devil a 
moral the folks ever had, 
Who live ha the town of Chicago.

THAT'S HOW YOU GET SERVED 
WHEN YOU'RE OLD 
SUNG BY FRANK VIM. 
The Music of this song can be had at Mrs. Pauline 
Lleder's Exten-ive Music Publishing House, No, 09 
Chatham Street, N. Y. and will be sert post 
paid, to any address, on receipt of pace, 
25 cents in postage stamps. 
One day in the street, I 
just happened to meet, 
An old friend whom I'd not seen for years, 
The old man was sad tho' to meet me was glad, 
And his eyes as we spoke filled with tears. 
I 
said, John, be brief, what's the cause of your grief I 
To me your misfortunes unfold; 
said he, in poor me, you a 
sample may see, 
Of how a 
man gets served when he's old. 
CHORUS. 
Each day growing older, I 
get the cold shoulder, 
By youngsters thrust out in the cold, 
Who jeeringly say, that I'm in the way, 
That's how you get served when you're old. 
When young I 
was praised, and my wages was raised; 
No labor then I 
ever did shirk; 
And my master would then point me out to the men, 
As the one who best stuck to his work. 
Now I'm feeble and weak, he'll to me hardly speak, 
Unless it's to grumble or scold; 
They simply make fun of what I 
have done, 
That's how you get served when you'ae old. 
C 
horuE 
My 
wife poor soul she is nearly seventy-three, 
How to keep her from want I 
don't know; 
If I 
beg, I 
intrude, and by police are pursued, 
And if to the Commissioners of Charities we gO, 
To seek for relief they but add to our grief, 
You must go to the Island we are told, 
Part husband. from wife, to be paupers for life, 
That's how you get served when you're old.

WHEN I 
SMOKED MY FIRST CIGAR, 
COMPOSED AND RECITED BY WALTER MACIL 
Copyright 1851 by Mrs. Pauline Lieder. 
12 was just behind the woodshed, 
One glorious summer day; 
Far o'er the hills the sinking sun, 
Pursued its western way. 
And in my lone seclusion, 
Safely removed afar 
From all earth's confusion, 
I 
smoked my first cigar. 
Ah bright the boyish fancies, 
Wrapped in the wreaths of blue, 
My eyes grew dim my head was light, 
The woodshed round me flew, 
Dark night closed in around me, 
Rayless without a 
star, 
Seim death I 
thought I 
had found. 
When I 
smoked my first cigar. 
I 
heard my fathers smothered laugh, 
It seemed so strange and far; 
S 
knew he knew, I 
knew he knew, 
ra smoked my first cigar,

PARODY ON EMpTY CRADLE, 
WRITTEN AND SUNG BY CHAS. GLIDDEN. 
Once I 
owned a 
yellow dog his name was 
Towser Jenkins, 
A butcher cut his tail off with a 
cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mark on all the cats in town, 
And when he spotted one he'd never leave her, 
He wore his legs off stumpey, 
Chaseing milk carts round the country, 
But the little house is empty where we ties him, 
A policeman spotted Towser, put sonic arsenic 
in his grub, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to look for rats in the happy hunting grounds 
He died this morning while the sun was rising; 
The flees have all turned out to hunt up a 
new 
lunch route, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
Oh! how that dog would grin, when a 
tramp 
would look at hit*, 
He used to put bay-windows in their breeches; 
Wore the hair all off his ribs, 
Chaseing cats around corn cribs, 
Had bunions on his knees from jumping ditches, 
On his nose he had two blisters, 
Where the rats chewed off his. whiskers, 
When he was asleep they'd paralyze him. 
But now he's gone and dusted, 
And his chest prstector's busted, 
Empty is the dog-house Towser's pizened. 
CHORUS. 
He has gone to hunt for liver, 
Way acrossed the Swanee river, 
No more in the sewer we'll baptise him, 
No more he'll homeward sail, 
With tin can's upon his tail, 
Empty is the dog-house-Towser's pizened.

MAN YOU DON'T MEET 
EVERY DAY. 
I've a 
nice little cabin that's built with mud, 
In the beautiful County Kildare, 
I've got acres of land, and men at command, 
And I 
have always a 
shilling to spare. 
Och! I 
didn't come here, boys, in search of a 
job, 
But just a 
short visit to pay, 
And as I 
walk through the streets, people say 
that I 
meet, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
CHORUS. 
Then call for your glasses, just have what you want, 
And whatever the damage I'll pay; 
Bhoys be airy and free when you're drinking wid me, 
For I'm the man you dcn't meet every day. 
When I 
landed in Glasgow, what a 
sight met 
my eyes, 
As I 
first put my foot on the shore; 
There was Felix O'Donough, blind Barney McGurk, 
And a 
round two or three dozen more. 
Och ! murther! you ought to have seen them 
all stare, 
And then they did all run away; 
Says I, •‘ my spalpeens, do you think I'm a 
ghost, 
Because I'm a 
man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus. 
I'm in love with a 
nice little girl in town, 
And we're going to be married to-day, 
And if you come over a 
twelvemonth from now, 
A 
right welcome to all I 
will pay. 
And I 
think I 
can show you a 
little spalpeen„ 
Who then will be able to say— 
To my friends round about, while yointing me out, 
There's the man you don't meet every day. 
Chorus.
