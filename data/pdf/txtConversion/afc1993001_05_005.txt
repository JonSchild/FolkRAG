THE CHINESE LANGUAGE SCHOOL IN SAN ANTONIO TEXAS

I.  Rationale for study In the Spring of 1976 I organized and
 
conducted a three-day conference, "Strategies for Inter-Ethnic
 
Communication*"  The conference was supported by a Grant from
 
the Texas Committee for the Humanities, and was held in San Antonio,
 
Texas.  During that conference I set Lily Bailey, principal of the
 
San Antonio Chinese Community School.  At that time we agreed that
 
both of us would benefit from a joist study of the school and its
 
relationship t. the San Antonio community.  When the Folklife Center
 
initiated the Ethnic Language School Project this Spring (1982), I
 
contacted Lily and we both decided this was the time to attempt
 
a fellow-through study of the San Antonio Chinese School.
 
After actual work on the study began I learned that Lily was
 
as longer principal of the school.  Moreover the present personnel
 
at the school were not open to working with Lily on this particualr
 
project.  Initial disappointment has been replaced by wonder: it
 
the history of the school and at the complexity of the Chinese
 
community (and its relationship) to the school.
 
This report contains no description of classes being conducted.
 
It does contain an account of my attempts to get permission (denied)
 
to describe the present classes; of first hand accounts of students'
 
experiences at the school from its conception in 1927 until 1980;
 
of Lily Bailey's description of the school from 1971 until 1980,
 
of the history of and present sake-up of the Chinese community in
 
San Antonio; and, of a variety of vicarious description of the
 
present school.

.  Persons interviewed. This report is based upon six formal,
 
taped interviews; four untaped interviews (one untaped by request,
 
one because of logistic impossibilities, and two because of their
 
spontaneous nature); and several untaped telephone conversations
 
with two different persons.
 
2.1.  Taped interviews. Rose Wu is the matriaich of the Chinese
 
community in San Antonio.  She is firmly established within the
 
recognized elite society of the city at large.  John Leung is a
 
generation younger than Rose; John and his wife Dora are both in
 
their sixties.  Mary Eng (and her husband Joseph) are of the same
 
generation as John and Dora Leung.  Sam Ng and Houchi Dung are of
 
a younger "generation-sets than the Leungs and the Engs, Sam and
 
Houchi being in their fifties.  Sam is a member of the same "Toi San"
 
group of Chinese as the older informants; Houchi is a member of the
 
Taiwanese group.  Joanna Leung, daughter of John and Dora, is the
 
youngest informant--in her twenties.
 
I should note a few peripheral items, which would otherwise
 
not pertain to the subject of this report.
 
Lily Bailey accompanied me on four of these interviews.  Her
 
participation during the interviews was discreet.  She was particularly
 
adept at leading the interviewees to fruitful topics.  In the interviews
 
with John Leung and Sam Ng her own comments on the school curriculum from
 
1971 through 1980 reinforce the information she gave as in untaped:
 
situations.
 
Other persons who appear in these four taped interviews ares
 
Do r
a (wife of John) in the John Leung interview; Joseph (husband
 
of Mary) in the Mary Eng interview; Jane Sturtevant, secretary for

Sam Ng, in his interview; a public health nurse (who does not talk,
 
but does enter the room) in the Houchi Dung interview; and David Trujillo,
 
fiance of Joanna Leung, in her interview--(Sam Ng also enters the
 
restaurant during this interview and exchanges greetings).
 
Rose Wu was interviewed in her home; Houchi Dung in his office
 
at the Medical Center.  Aside from a couple of instances when we thumb
 
through photo albums close to the microphones ,the fidelity of these
 
tapes is crisp and clear.  John Leung and his daughter Joanna were
 
b
oth i
nterviewed i
n the Leung r
estaurant.  Music i
s p
laying i
n the
 
background and periodically an ice machine turns on and off.  Sam
 
Ng was interviewed in his insurance office--a converted garage at
 
the rear of his house, on a busy street.  Traffic noise occasionally
 
interfere with the conversation on the tape.
 
2.2.  Untamed interviews. My initial interview was with Lily Bailey
 
at her house.  Lily requested that the interview not be taped.  She
 
hoped at that time (as she did during the first few weeks of the
 
research) that if her own role in the project were minimized the
 
present administration of the school would consent to participating
 
in the study.  Because such participation did not occur and because
 
we were unable to schedule a taped interview at a later date, I have
 
transcribed all of Lily's contributions during the other interviews.
 
While this documentation procedure is certainly not as satisfactory as
 
an actual taped interview, it does isolate Lily's contributions for
 
easy reference.
 
During the initial interview with Lily she outlined a series
 
of other interviews she had arranged for me.  I relied solely on
 
these initial contacts at the beginning of the research.  Later
 
I interviewed other contacts I had--but these interviews were solely
 
of an informal nature.  Lily did not know for W
e at this first
 
SA Chinese -
 L
i
.
 
interview that we would be unable to visit the school itself--thus
 
she did not tell as of the problem.
 
The second untaped interview was with Bill Ng--one of those
 
interv
s Lily arranged and participated in.  Bill wished to be
 
interviewed at his store--an oriental shop in the middle of the
 
Mexican Market, El Mercado, in downtown San Santonio.  Since the
 
market is extremely crowded and noisy, I made no attempt to record
 
the interview.
 
Two other interviews were not recorded.  Both were sp%taneoua and
 
I was forced to make notes as soon after the interview as possible.
 
Ewing Chinn, a professor of philosophy and a collegue of mine at
 
Trinity University, heard of the study and cornered me in the Faculty
 
lounge.  He then told of his experiences attending a Chinese language
 
school as a child in San Francisco.  John Leung, Jr., who has done
 
some of the professional photography work for this project told me
 
in my office late one day of his experience as a student of Lily Bailey.
 
We did not have the recording equipment set up at the time.
 
2
.3.  Tele hone interviews. On the same day she arranged our first
 
interview, Lily also arranged for me to visit the langt e school.
 
However Ruth Lew, the woman I was to visit, telephoned the day of
 
the appointment to cancel it.  That was the first of six different
 
telephone conversations I had with Ms. Lew.  I have made notes on
 
the conversations; I have yet to meet Ruth Lew.
 
The President of the Chinese Community Council is a man named
 
David Lew.  I conversed with David on the telephone one time.  He
 
vehemently denied me permission to attend the school.
 I have made
 
notes from that conversation.

.  The San Antonio Chinese community. The comments in this section
 
are included only insofar as they contribute to the understanding
 
of the language school and its relationship to the Chinese community.
 
I have made no attempt to systematically describe the make-up,
 
historically or synchronically, of the Chinese Community.  I have
 
included in the documentation a couple of popular summaries of the
 
Texas (including San Antonio) Chinese communities; both published
 
by the Institute of Texan Cultures and both containing initial
 
bibliographies for future study.  However, during the interviewing
 
I did notice certain comments on the make-up of the Chinese community
 
which either clarified the present situation of the language school
 
or contained references to the history of the community which were
 
at variance with the documentation in the Institute studies.
 
3.1.  History. The first Chinese language lessons were offered
 
in the early twenties through the outgrowth of Sunday School lessons
 
at the Chinese Baptist Church.  About 1927 a group of ten Chinese
 
businessmen bought a building on San Saba street, in downtown
 
San Antonio.  Language lessons were formalized and expanded.  Shortly
 
after that a second group of Chinese opened another language school
 
in a building already owned by some Chinese Free Masons.
 
None interviewed seemed to know when the Free Masons' lessons
 
stopped; all agreed that in the middle fifties an urban renewal project
 
forced the sale of the San Saba building, which in turn terminated
 
formal language lessons.
 
No Chinese language lessons were offered consistently until
 
about 1970, when the group associated with the San Saba school opened
 
classes on Saturdays at Trinity University.  In 1972 a new building
 
SA Chinese -
 6
 
was purchased on the far North side of town, on Rhapsody Street.
 
Weekend classes continued on a large scale until 1980, when Lily
 
Bailey resigned as principal of the school.  At present minimal
 
classes are held for a couple of hours each Sunday.
 
All of these various language classes have been supported by
 
Chinese descended from the earliest settlers in San Antonio--those
 
from the Southern China area of Toi San.  Lily Bailey and Bill Eng
 
explained that these Southern Chinese spoke a dialect known as the
 
Toi San dialect.  It did not (and still does not) have the prestige
 
of the other main Southern Chinese dialect, Cantonese (ale, spoken
 
in Hong Kong).  Lily mentioned that Cantonese has its own literature;
 
Toi San does not.  According to Bill, most of the first Chinese
 
to settle in the United States were from the Toi San area, and
 
settled mostly in the Middle and Southern parts of t
)
United States.
 
Later immigrants,,­-who spoke Cantonese, settled on the East and West
 
coasts of the United States.  Not until after the first Japanese
 
invasion of China were there many immigrants from Northern China,
 
where Mandarin is spoken.
 (At present, the official ] guage of
 
Mainland China is Mandarin.)  The Toi San people, in general, were
 
and are associated with the peasantry; the Cantonese and Mandarin
 
with Middle and Upper Middle clas.
 
Throughout the course of this Study I was aware of mixed feelings
 
of acceptance and rejection this basically P01 San group in San Antonio
 
feel; in their relations with South Texans in general and with other
 
Chinese in particular.
 
In commenting on the group's identity in San Antonio, Rose Wu
 
observed that the Chinese had always mingled with the rest of the
 
S
 
SA Chinese -
 7
 
community;  she pointed out that they were invited to make a dragon
 
for the early Battle of Flower parades and they are still being asked
 
to do so.  However Mary Eng spoke openly of racial prejucice in
 
Shreveport, Louisiana (where Chinese were segregated into the same
 
schools as were Negroes) and gave one extended anecdote relating
 
her prolbems in finding a neighborhood in which to build a house
 
in San AntoniO-without running into racial prejudice.
 (Lily Bailey
 
mentioned to me once that she had heard once that the San Saba school
 
was started because the Chinese children in San Antonio had to attend
 
Negro school during the day, but their parents wanted them to play
 
with other Chinese after school.)  And Rose Wu, herself, relates with
 
considerable pride the role ihe took in State legislative action
 
that allowed all Chinese, whether naturalized citizens or not, to
 
own private (real estate) property.
 
Coupled with this ambivalence about acceptance is an apparent
 
ambivalence about emotional roots; with San Antonio or with China.
 
At the end of his interview, John and Dora Leung and Lily Bailey
 
were talking about how deep the roots in San Antonio were.  As John
 
put it, "In San Antonio...the Chinese come and stay in San Antonio."
 
However in a later interview with Sam Ng, Sam mentioned that his main
 
purpose in learning Chinese was to allow him to return to China to
 
work and to live.  Mary Eng talked of her earlier desire to be a
 
missionary to China.  Lily agreed that this motivation was pervasive.
 
She explained--more to Sam Ng than to me--the meaning of an old
 
Chinese proverbs
 
The Chinese people have a sayings "No matter how
 
tall the tree is, the leaves always come down to the
 
roots."  That means, when you are a Chinese, no matter
 
how far the country is, where you go to work, you still
 
V
 
SA Chinese -
 8
 
come back to the original dirt.  To be buried.  So that's
 
the way we have in our minds.  Even when we were young.
 
Wten you memorize the classical verse, there is one like
 
that.  The leaves will come back to the roots.
 
Houchi Dung echoes this ambivalence when talking about his own
 
emotional ties.  He feels that his two boys will both become completely
 
Americanized; marry non-Chinese Americans. and eventually lose their
 
Chinese identity.  However Houchi and his wife both hope to return
 
to Taiwan within ten years, and live there the rest of their lives.
 
Overall the ambivalence has never seemed to be other than
 
expected.  The Chinese community's involvement in social activities
 
has shQvn a healthy balance of cultures.  John Leung is modest about,
 
Lily Bailey proud of, his various presidencies: with the Chinese
 
American Community Association (an intercultural organization);
 
with the Chinese Baptist Church (monocultural), and with the
 
Chinese Community Council (monocu].tural(.  And Mary Eng seems
 
quite pleased with her mixture of all Chinese and Chinese-with-
San Antonio group affiliations.
 
3
.2.  Present. The most obvious and also the most important difference
 
between the Chinese community,-of the thirtyies (that supported
 
the San Saba school) and the Chinese community of today (that supports
 
the Rhapsody school) is the ethnic complexity of the present community.
 
In 1927 all Chinese in San Antonio were from southern China and
 
spoke Toi San.  Today the Toi San speakers constitute only one of
 
two neclei for the Chinese community.  And neither nucleus attracts
 
a clear majority of the Chinese community.  At the end of the
 
interview with Rose Wu, Lily Bailey commented on th4s present-day
 
diversity:
 
S
 
SA Chinese -

You see [
in Rose's] time, all the Chinese that would come
 
.
.. over to San Antonio.  Stay here.  They feel part.
 
[Today they just] feel acquainted.  And another things
 
Too many outside people.  That move from San Francisco.
 
That move from Taiwan, Hong Kong move over here.  They
 
don't want to feel.  And this other group, the grocery
 
store and people like that, feel like they are inferior.
 
But they are not.  Because their children all have more
 
education.  They and the people that come from Taiwan and
 
Hong Kong.
 •. . .
 We have, now, including the outside
 
people, we have about three thousand people here.  But
 
some from Puerto Rico, and some from Vietnam.
 
Twice during this explanation, Rose Wu interrupted with comments
 
of agreement.
 
In the middle fifties this "inside" Toi San group--the group
 
Lily referred to as "the grocery store and people like that" group--
decided to organize the Chinese Community Council, apparently of
 
and for the Toi San group alone.  The Council consisted originally
 
of nineteen membersi today the Council still has nineteen members
 
on its executive beard.  For the Toi San group, membership on this
 
19-member board appears to be important.  John Leung was the Council's
 
first President.  Lily Bailey was elected a member of the Council
 
in 1971 and still serves on the council in 1982.  When Lily explainec
 
to me who we were to interview, she told me that all except Bill Eng
 
had served on the Council.
 (Houchi Dung also has not served on the
 
Council.)  This council was responsible for the sale of the San Sabe
 
school and for the purchase of the Rhapsody school.  Fifteen years
 
elapsed between the sale of the former and the purchase of the latter.
 
During those fifteen years little, if any, language instruction
 
took place.
 In my attempts to discover what did take place during
 
those fifteen years, I discovered nothing but wonderment and silence.
 
Sam Ng finally explained my inability to penetrate the darkness
 
by stating that nothing happened a
*It's simple,Scott.  If you don't
 
want something to get done, give it to a committee-"
 
SA Chinese -
 10
 
When I first contacted Lily Bailey about this study she suggested
 
I contact Houchi Dung.  Houchi is a medical
, doctor and an associate
 
professor of Anatomy at the University of Texas Medical Center in
 
San Antonio.  Born in Taiwan, Houchi went to Medical School in
 
Louisville, Kentucky, in the late fifties.  He moved to San Antonio
 
in the late sixties.  A staunch support of the Communist regime in
 
Mainland China, Houchi was invited to visit the mainland in 1973.
 
The visit so depressed Houchi that his political views changed im-
mediately.  Upon his return to the United States he began to organize
 
and eventually founded a San Antonio chapter of the Taiwan Benevelent
 
Society.  This new organization began to immediately attract some
 
of the newer members of the Chinese community jn San Antonio.
 
The differences between the two groups, the Taiwanese and the
 
Toi San, are many and deep.  Houchi was insistent in avoiding any
 
discussion of the Toi Sara group, dismissing them withs
 
It's really very simple.  People who are interested in that
 
place [Rhapsody School] are not high caliber or heavyweight
 
people from Chinese community here.  Of course,  just like
 
every other minority, you need a place to identify. .. . .
 
I learned the situation very quickly and decide there is
 
no need to associate with that place.
 
Houchi was the last person I planned to interview.  In response
 
to his queries about how the study had gone, I confessed my frustration
 
at being unable to actually visit the school.  His reaction was that
 
I had done no worse than he would have done.  His own inability to
 
become integrated wholly into the Chinese community in San Antonio was
 
apparent, but he claims not to be bothered by it.
 
"My problem," he told me, "is that they think I am Communist."
 
His analysis may be correct.  But the day after the interview I r
e
turned S
 
to Bill Eng at the El Mercado to take some pictures.  When Bill learned
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
SA Chinese -
 11
 
that I had talked to Houchi, he gave me a rather lengthy and passionate
 
anti-Taiwan talk.  While his dislike was for cultural, not political,
 
reasons, he obviously did not dismiss Houchi Dung for being communist--
rather for being Taiwanese.
 
Within the Toi San Chinese a generational, linguistic gap
 
has occurred--similar to that of most immigrant populations.  The
 
grandparents speak only Chinese, the grandchildren speak only English.
 
Lily Bailey, John Leung, and Joanna Leung all commented on the phenomenon.
 
All agree that communication does occur across the generational -
linguistic gap.  All also surmise that with the passing of the
 
grandparent generation, the need for even a passive knowledge of
 
Chinese will cease.
 
Still, one charming vestige of the generational custom was
 
discussed at some length by Joanna.  She, her two sisters, and
 
her brother all have "official* Chinese names, bestowed upon t
.em
 
by their grandparents.  Joanna went to some length in discussing
 
the four names, their meaning in English, and their significance
 
to the entire family.  She is obviously pround of the names.
 
(
An obvious counterpoint to this anecdote is the similarly lengthy
 
discussion in my interview with John Leung, in which he and Dora
 
recall, fondly, how John and all his siblings were given English
 
and Christian names by the minister's wife at the Chinese Baptist
 
Church.)
 
Whatever the present complexities of the Chinese community
 
in San Antonio, those I have interviewed do seem pleased with their
 
lives in the city.  John Leung stated toward the end of his interviews
 
SA Chinese -12
 
There is no China Town, there is no central part where
 
they live.  Everybody's spread out.  But then the only
 
gathering they do is going to the club meetings, and
 
council meetings, and things like that.  And the functions
 
that they have.
 
And Dora added:
 "or weddings, or babies' one month old parties."
 
3
.3.  Personal. In the taped interviews, untaped interviews, and
 
telephone conversations occasional, personal comments would occur.
 
While duly noting and documenting such comments, I made (sometimes
 
mental, sometimes actual) notes to myself to delete at a later date.
 
However, when I approached the various (that is, all) people involved,
 
I was invariably told not to delete or omit anything.  This lack of
 
help in the editing process bothered me.  Again, Bill Eng came to
 
my rescue.  "Why are you bothered?" he asked.  "If people said anything
 
to you, they knew it was for permanent record.
 If you decide to edit,
 
you may not be editing as much as censoring."
 
For the record, then, separate documentation will give details
 
about the personal lives of and comments about most of the people
 
involved in the study.  Rose Wu has some delightful anecdotes about
 
her childhood in Arizona and her decision to move with her husband
 
to the "mudhole" which was Sari Antonio in the early thirties.
 
John Leung talks about his and Dora's wedding in San Antonio--either the
 
first or second Chinese wedding in the city.  Mary Eng discusses in
 
great length her childhood in Louisiana, her childhood visits to
 
China, and her money-gathering efforts through a racially prejudiced
 
South during the Japanese invasion of China.  Sam Ng talks about
 
his family and his various businesses.  Bill Eng tells about his
 
leaving the restaurant business in 1957 and about his wife's backgroun
 
in Hong Kong.  Houchi Dung gives an extended discussion of his
 
S
 
S
 
SA Chinese -
 13
 
conversion from one Chinese political ideiology to its opposite,
 
talks abut his one visit to Mainland China and subsequent two visits
 
to Taiwan, and candidly talks about his family (and his wife's family)
 
both in Taiwan and in the United States.  And Joanna Leung talks about
 
her siblings, about college (with a delightful anecdote concerning
 
her genetic background-.a discussion between her and a classmate in
 
a biology class, where Joanna thought the question referred to her
 
academic background in biology), and--with her fiance joining in--
discusses the problems of  planning a wedding in the United States
 
between a Mexican-American and a Chinese-American, and how they plan
 
to raise their children with a Tr -Cultural heritage.
 
In the interview with Sam Ng, Lily Bailey talks about the
 
difficulties she had in memorizing the tables she needed to use
 
with an abacus.  Not on tape, but important for this report, Lily
 
told me about her childhood in the Philippines, about her attempts
 
to learn (and to master) all three Chinese languages/dialects
 
(Toi San, Cantonese, Mandarin), about her marriage to a very tall
 
Indiana man with a Ph.D. in Classical Chinese, and about the move
 
from Indiana to San Antonio in the late 1960's.
 
3.4.  Chinese Baptist Church.  During the course of the interview with
 
John Leung, Lily Bailey made an important observations
 "Most of the
 
meetings are at big restaurants or to the school.  Or to the Church.
 
And it's all connected.
 It's the only church."  The Church she
 
referred to, almost as an afterthought, was the Chinese Baptist
 
Church.  This Baptist Church, along with a couple of references
 
to other Chinese Baptist churches, appears as a unifying thread
 
throughout the various interviews.
 
SA Chinese -  14
 
Lily mentioned to me at one time that now that she is no longer
 
principal of the language school, she has been able to become more
 
active in the Chinese Baptist Church again.  She also mentioned
 
in the Sam Ng interview that she had given free Chinese conversation
 
lessons to some Americans who wished to become missionaries to China.
 
As mentioned above, John Leung and his siblings were all named
 
by the minister's wife at the Baptist Church.  Both John and Dora
 
lamented that their strong participation in the Chinese Baptist
 
Church has suffered as a consequence of their decision to convert
 
their grocery store into a restaurant ten years ago.  Now that the
 
restaurant is established, they suggested (on tape) that they really
 
should get more involved again.  They also wondered, at one point,
 
if the Chinese Language School really had not developed out of
 
the Church.
 
Rose Wu, whose husband was one of the first teachers in the
 
Sari Saba school, stated (in a later interview) that indeed the first
 
lessons had grown out of a Sunday School class at the Chinese Baptist
 
Church.  Joanna Leung mentioned that the main reason she attended
 
Chinese language classes (at Trinity) was to be with her peers from
 
the Church--which she attended more for social than religious
 
purposes.
 
Mary Eng talked about her youth in Shreveport, Louisiana, and
 
how the Baptist Church was an integral part of that childhood.
 
She also mentioned her early desire to be a missionary to China.
 
Even Mouchi Dung, the Taiwanese  utsider, was baptized in a
 
Baptist Church in Taiwan.
 (Although, he is quick to say, he is not
 
a member of a Chinese Baptist Church now--or any church for that
 
matter.)

 Chinese Language Schools in San Antonio. Although the data have
 
been fragmentary and anecdotal, for the most part, it has been possible
 
to extract from the various interviews, taped and otherwise, a rough
 
"oral history" description of the six different language schools
 
that have existed in San Antonio since the middle twenties.  While
 
the linguist in me has been totally disappointed in this research,
 
the sociologist, folklorist, and resident of San Antonio have been
 
amply rewarded.
 
1
.1.  Chinese Battist Church.  Rose Vu, the matriarch, the person
 
John Leung immediately said I should talk to about the history of
 
the school, was adamant in -her interpretation that the first language
 
lessons were an outgrowth of Sunday School classes in the Chinese
 
Baptist Church.  "Mrs. Murray taught," she said.  "It was first
 
started at the Baptist Church, which was upstairs in a building,
 
over a restaurant and a bar."  Lily Bailey was delighted at the
 
recollection:
 
Most of the people say San Saba [was the first school],
 
but I remember talking to one or two people.  They say
 
started over a bar.  They they [other people] laugh -.at
 
me, you know.  Toi Mei was very old toe.
 I think she told
 
me because her husband was very active.
 
#
.2.  San Saba.  All agree that the San Saba school was the first
 
to have its own building and its own full time teachers.  In the
 
publications from the Institute of Texan Cultures, picture of the
 
San Saba school are prominent.  When I first walked into John Leung's
 
restaurant, his wife Dora had an old album which she (and Lily)
 
thought was from the first years of that school.
 (We subsequently
 
learned that the album was from the Chinese War Refugee Relief drive
 
and that the persons involved (as well as the building) were from
 
SA Chinese -
 16
 
the San Saba group.)  John and Dora Leung asked if I could get a
 
copy of a picture of the San Saba building which was hanging on
 
the wall of a Mexican restaurant on the near North Side of town.
 
(The owner of that restaurant, Can oe Pena, has cooperated.  When
 
he was a child, his father took him down to the San Saba area
 
(the picture in question is dated 1964) to take pictures of the
 
neighborhood before urban renewal destroyed it.  Can oe had often
 
wondered if that was the Chinese school.  He seemed glad to learn
 
it was and to allow us to make copies of the picture.)
 
The information on the San Saba school has come from three
 
primary sourcess  Mary Eng and Rose Wu were both in San Antonio
 
at or near the time the school started; John Leung and Sam Ng both
 
attended the school--John in the thirties and Sam in the forties;
 
and Lily Bailey had heard stories about the school during her twelve
 
or thirteen years in the city.
 
Both John Leung's father and Sam Ng's grandfather were among
 
ten Chinese businessmen  who each contributed about $500
 each for
 
the purchase of the building on San Saba--a location that Mary Eng
 
described as in the west neighborhood (to San Antonio people that
 
is synonymous with Mexican) near grocery row.  John Leung articulated
 
the founding this ways
 "There was about ten...businessmen, Chinese
 
businessmen, here in town that decided that we need a Chinese school
 
for the youngsters here, see.
 '
Cause all the kids were growing up
 
and no one was speaking Chinese."  According to Mary, from the
 
school's conception and through the forties the teachers and the
 
school itself were closely tied in with  the Chinese Baptist Church-

As mentioned earlier the building itself served purposes other
 
than than that of a school alone.  Birthday parties, weddings, Chinese
 
New Year parties, and "Double Ten" (October tenth--the date of Chinese
 
Independence Day) parties were also held in the building.  Mary Eng
 
also remembers a Drum and Bugle Corps that met in the building.  She
 
and her husband Joseph also sponsored a student center in thebuilding--
the center expanded into a Youth Club during the war years in the
 
forties; a meeting place for the numerous Chinese soldiers and Air Force
 
personnel associated with San Antonio's five military installations.
 
The taped interviews indicate some confusion about whether the
 
teachers were volunteers or were hired.  Mary Eng and Lily Bailey
 
thought no one was hired until about 1971.  But Rose Wu, John Leung,
 
and Sam Ng all agree that the San Saba teachers were paid.  They
 
were all hired, Sam said, but some were real, REAL, teachers and
 
some were just hired.  According to Rose Wu, her husband Ted was the
 
first teacher at the San Saba school, but after the two of them
 
were married, he quit teaching and went into business.
 
Both John and Sam went to school every weekday from L
h3O
 until
 
630 p.m., then they would go home and do the homework from the
 
American school.  The Chinese school required no homework.  They
 
both studied some Chinese history and culture; but mostly language.
 
Reading and writing were learned from regular Mainland China textbooks.
 
About every two months, the school would have an open house for parents.
 
Writing samples were displayed on the walls, plays were given, debates
 
were held.  As John put it, "Our parents were very proud."
 
The real core of those San Saba lessons, though, appears to
 
be the study of Classical Chinese.  John explained that after six
 
i
wChinese
TL1
—
  
- 18
 
years in the school he began to study the classical; which was
 
all 
i*
 
"It's been so long,  I forgot.
 I'm being truthful," he told
 
Lily Bailey, laughing as he did so.
 I asked both John and Lily,
 
and later Sam,  if any of them could remember any of the content
 
of those classical lessons.  They all said they could not.
 I asked
 
if any of the contents of those classical works had been translated
 
into English, so their children--or even they themselves--would have

them.
 
Sam recalled these lessons fondly, however.
 "We really
 
studied hard.  A lot of memory work.
 But I can't remember any
 
rof it.—  ;
i*
 
Joanna Leung dismissed the whole study of the classical
 
Chinese withs  "Sam and Da *j studied Mandarins the classical Chinese."
 
Whatever the content,  or method of teaching,  or hours of school,
 
I
the San Saba school appeare d to thrive for its roughly thirty years
 
of existence.  At one point in his interview, John Leung turned to
 
Ba iley and saids
 
S

implied and Lily Bailey supported with reported rumors only, racial
 
segregation may have forced the Chinese into furnishing a place for
 
their children to gather after school.
 
The racial problem is debatable.  The need to gather after
 
school is not.  Most of the Tol San people were in the grocery
 
business, and each grocery store was basically a family store.
 
As a consequence, both parents worked early morning until eight or
 
so in the evening.  The older children could, of course, work in
 
the store after school.  The younger ones needed a place to gather
 
with some type of supervision.  During the Mary Eng interview,
 
Lily Bailey explained to me:
 "They had no activities, nowhere to
 
go.  So therefore they all had to go to the Chinese school."
 
Sam Ng stated that basically the school served a baby sitting function.
 
But underneath it all was the idea, expressed by John Leung
 
above, that the founders of the school were worried that their children
 
were not learning Chinese.
 
While both John and Sam stated that they were forced to go,
 
by their parents, both agreed they had fun and looked back on those
 
years fondly.  Sam regretted that his playful nature with a particular
 
teacher had him expelled from the school permanently after ten years
 
of attendance.
 
One special motivating force should be mentioned, since it
 
does occur in the literature of other language schools.  Sam stated
 
that he and his brothers were expected to learn Chinese so that once
 
they grew up and became engineers or professionaf
ly trained in a
 
practical skill they could return and offer their expertise to the
 
devopment of China.  This same motivation was not expected of his
 
SA Chinese -
 20
 
sisters.
 "I think the way it started.  The reason I think it started
 
just like my parents, my daddy, see, he wanted us to go back to China."
 
When I asked Sam if his father expected to return himself, he answered,
 
"Only to visit."  When I asked if he or any of his brothers did go back
 
to work, he said no.
 
But the San Saba school's days did come to a close.
 "Urban
 
Renewal" bought the place out, according to the usual rhetoric.
 
Early in our interview process, misled somewhat, I believe, by
 
the fact that the pictures showed the San Saba building still standing
 
in 1964, we thought the building has been sold in the middle sixties.
 
Lily turned to me during the Mary Eng interview and started to explains
 
"Hemisphere started buying the property so they, uh, sold it."
 
Mary interrupted hers
 "No.  They sold it before then, before 1968."
 
But Mary could reconstruct no better than that.
 
Several interviews later Lily posed the question to Rose Wu:
 
"When was the San Saba school sold?  Some people told me 1952.
 
Yesterday I hear 1958.  And I heard also one said 1954.  But I know
 
it was in the middle fifties."  Rose answered; not too definitively,
 
"The expressay bought San Saba about twenty-five years ago."

1.3.  Masonic School.  Not long after the San Saba school began,
 
a second language school began.
 I have referred to this second
 
school as the Masonic School; most refer to it as the "other" school.
 
In responding to Lily Bailey's question about why the second school
 
started, Rose Wu said,
 "Oh, gossip started that school.  Someone
 
thought the San Saba school was making money."
 
When Lily told Sam Ng that I have had an interview with Bill Eng,
 
Sam laughed and said; "Oh, he went to that 'other' school.  The rich
 
kid's school."
 
S

Bill Eng's own good humored and low-key explanation is as
 
follows.  During the early Toi San days in San Antonio there were
 
no Chinese lawyers, so the two biggest 'families', the Lees and the
 
Ngs formed organizations, or associations, referred to as Tongs
  
to handle business matters.  There were, in San Antonio, a few
 
'
Tong' fights, but certainly no Tong wars.
 
After the Ng Tong founded the San Saba school, the Lee Tong
 
decided to hold classes in the building in which they held most
 
of their meetings, the Free Mason building on the corner of Houston
 
and Laredo in downtown San Antonio.
 
They had old fashioned teachers; many grades in one room.
 
The school lasted from the late thirties to the middle forties.
 
Sam had. only one teacher, Lee Sat Ping.  They met wee ays from
 
1
s00 until 8
.00 p.m.; Saturdays 9
:00 until noon.  Lee Sat Ping was
 
hired full time.  They had about 20 to 30 students,  Bill went to
 
the school for seven or eight years.
 
Each child brought a Chinese book from his own home (the parents
 
could choose the book) and the teacher would help the child read
 
t
} book.  They also studied brush writing and, later, Classical
 
Chinese.  And, no, he could not remember any of the classical Chinese,
 
either.  All he could remember was that they memorized words and
 
repeated them to the teacher.
 
L
.
.Il  Interim Classes. Apparently one major reason for forming the
 
Chinese Council was to handle the business transactions conncected
 
with the sale of the San Saba building, in the middle fifties.
 In
 
any case, the money from the sale of the building lay dormant until
 
the purchase of the Rhapsody property in 1971.  During those fifteen
 
SA Chinese -
 22
 
years, no one seems to be certain about whether or not Chinese 1anguag
 
classes were held or not.
 
Sam Ng was a member of the Council during that fifteen year
 
period and all he remembers for Vqre was that a man named Joe Chew
 
initiated the steps to begin teaching classes on Saturdays in rented
 
space at Trinity University.  Both Rose Wu and Mary Eng claim that
 
classes were held during that intervening time.  Rose has no idea
 
where they were held, but feels sure that classes were held.  Mary
 
Eng says that in 1955,
 she is almost certain, classes were held at
 
the Chinese Baptist Church--her mother-in-law was the teacher.  Mary
 
also remembers making a float for a parade in the late fifties
 
with students from the Chinese language classes.  The float was built
 
at her houses she does not know where the classes met.

k
.5.  Trinity University. Joe Chew did begin the classes at Trinity
 
and was principal of the Chinese language school.  What really occurred
 
in those classes seems confusing even to Lily Bailey: in my Interview
 
with Sam Ng she tried to explain this ways
 
Joe had several teachers, agree to teach, like Chinn.  He
 
has a grocery store...Elaine, she promise to t
each, but Joe
 
open up the school there was no teacher.  That's how they
 
got me, to fill up the three classes into one.  Because
 
they had Elaine Chinn, Ed Mock's wife, and Joe Chew's wife
 
and somebody else.  Five classes.  Well then, when school
 
started, enrollment and everything else, nobody showed up.
 
And so that's why they called me.  And then they mix the
 
other three classes.  So I taught the Cantonese class and
 
his wife taught the older group.
 
At another time Lily told Mary Eng that Mandarin classes were
 
started, by Lily, at Trinity in 1971--that until that time Mandarin
 
had not been taught in any of the San Antonio schools.  In the
 
interview with John Leung, Lily explained to me that they had
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
SA Chinese -
 23
 
met for two years, at Trinity, but only during the summer.
 "Two
 
days a week and Saturdays for about two hours."
 
Both Lily and John thought that John Leung, Jr., had attended
 
both years at Trinity.  But when I talked to John Jr., he said he
 
had only gone for about one month, one summer.  He thought Mrs. Bailey
 
was a good teacher, but he wanted to study calligraphy or painting
 
(at which Lily Bailey excells) but she only showed them how on one
 
occasion.  He thought that the Chinese Readers, which were of a
 
"See Dick Run" level were humiliating.  He really enrolled in the
 
course so he could learn conversational Chinese, in order to com-
municate with his grandmother.  When he asked his folks if he could
 
quit, they said yes.
 "I'm really interested, now," he said.
 
"But not then, I was only 12 years old and didn't know."
 
11
.6.  Rhapsody, 1972-1980. Lily Bailey served as principal of the
 
Chinese Language School from 1972 until 1980.  While she gave me
 
the names of over a dozen students for interviewing, all of the
 
students were out of town--either having moved away or attending
 
co]lege.  At the last minute, Joanna Leung returned from college to
 
get married.  She agreed to an interview.
 
Unfortunately, Joanna could remember little of the school days--
she could not even remember if all of her classes (she attended for
 
two years) were held at Rhapsody or if some were held at Trinity.
 
She did not remember anything about the classes themselves.  All she
 
knew for sure was that she must have gone when she was in elementary
 
school, because she remembers several things from her middle school
 
days and Chinese school "is not part of those memories."  She also
 
went because she thought it would please her parents:
 "They are
 
SA Chinese -
 24
 
pro-ethnic.  They went to school when they were young and it was
 
a good thing.  So .
.. they made me go."  Her main reason for going,
 
as mentioned earlier in the report, was to spend more time with her
 
friends, especially a cousin, from the Chinese Baptist Church.
 
Apparently the Trinity school did well enough that the Chinese
 
Community Council decided to take the money from the sale of the
 
Sari Sabe school and invest in new property.  According to Rose Wu,
 
language instruction was not as important a factor as tax purposes;
 
by investing the San Saba money they would be moøe, arily ahead.
 
Rose was opposed to the particular site chosen--it was too far north
 
in the city for those children living in the south side of town.
 
But, she said, "The younger people wanted it, so I went along."
 
Lily, Rose, and Mary Eng, among others, added some of their own money
 
to that of the San Saba trust for the purchase of the Rhapsody
 
property.  Each year, the Chinese Community Council sponsors an
 
eggroll booth at the summer Texas Folklife Festival and raise enough
 
money to pay the taxes on the new property and building.
 
Joe Chew was elected Vice President of the Community Council
 
in 1972.  That created a vacancy in the Principalship of the language
 
School.  Lily became principal.  Soon after, Joe Chew left the
 
United States and returned to Taiwan.  During the following eight
 
years enrollment (and attendance) in the classes ranged from a low
 
of sixty to a high of 220.  Adults, as well as children attended
 
the classes.  Chinese speakers of Cantonese and Toi San came to
 
learn Mandarin.  And a small group of Anglos attended classes for
 
two years; to become missionaries.

Lily Bailey principalship of the language school appears to
 
have been absolute, and thoroughly professional.  She was a member
 
of the national Chinese Language Teacher's Association.  She has
 
furnished me copies of school newsletters and bulletins from the
 
Chinese Baptist Church, which document content of the courses to
 
some extent.  She clearly developed a balance of conversational
 
and written materials.  In the interview with John Leung, she
 
explained several times her own methods of teachings mixing recitation
 
with brush writing, displaying writing samples during parties at
 
the Rhapsody building, and developing competition among the various
 
classes--an explanation that prompted John to turn to me and says
 
"That's the difference of a good teacher or...and a...just r
un of the
 
mill."  In a private conversation, Lily explained to me that she ordered
 
some materials from San Francisco (bibliographic information is included
 
with this report) and wrote some materials--the latter she gave to the
 
school when she resigned in 1980.
 
k.7
.  Rhapsody, 1980-1982. Sometime in 1980, Lily Bailey resigned
 
as principal of the language school.  Her explanation to me was that
 
she got tired of all the disatisfaction, built up over the years.
 
Houchi Dung's explanation was that she was forced out--that he had
 
encouraged her to resign years earlier.  Sam Ng's explanation was
 
that she got a "raw deal."
 
All three admit that the resignation was unpleasant, harmful
 
to the enrollment at the school, and the result of petty infighting
 
and politics on the part of the Chinese Community Council.
 
Clearly the most  personally frustrating element in the study
 
of the Chinese language school has been my inability to study "The School."
 
SR Chinese -

Houchi Dung assures me that had I been able to work with the p
r
i
n
c
ipiS
 
involved with the school itself, I would not have learned as much
 
about either the history of the school or the complexity of the
 
present Chinese community.  While such assurances help to soothe
 
my frustration, they may not necessarily be true.  What is true, is
 
that I was able to talk to only two people involved directly with
 
the present school, and I was able to do that only by telephone.
 
Lily Bailey arranged early in the project for me to visit the
 
language school on Sunday, April 18, 1982.  At 2:00 P
.M. on that day,
 
the students would be working on a dragon, which they would use in
 
the upcoming Battle of Flowers Parade.  At 10*00 A.M. on the day
 
of my appointment, Ruth Lew phoned to cancel the photography session.
 
In fact, she seemed surprised that I had intended to take photographs.

She did ask that I phone back, and gave her number.
 
The following day she phoned again (I was not in) and left a
 
message that she would "like to explain things."  I did not reach
 
her until two days later.
 
the school itself had not
 
resigned-- that it was now
 
In that conversation she explained that
 
had a principal since Lily Bailey had
 
run by a committee of three persons.  She
 
did not name any of the three.  She said that the three were not
 
qualified, but were willing to "do it."  She also volunteered that
 
later in the month, the television program PM Magazine would air
 
some film they had just taken at the School.
 (The local ABC station
 
later donated a copy of the footage to this project.)  And she
 
suggested that I telephone David Lew, president of the Community
 
Council to get permission to attend the last session of thD school,
 
which would be meeting on the following Sunday.
 
SA Chinese -
 27
 
I was able to reach Mr. Lew by phone later that evening.  He
 
was extremely upset at my call.  He cnuld not believe Ruth Lew had
 
asked me to call; he was shocked when I said I wanted to talk to Ruth
 
because she was a teacher at the school (
"Ruth is a teacher?  Who
 
told you Ruth was a teacher?  She's not a teacher at the school.");
 
he said he would not give me permission nor deny me permission to
 
attend the Sunday class, because he could not without the entire Council's
 
approval, and the Council did not meet again until June.
 
If I understood him correctly, Lily Bailey had asked the Council's
 
approval earlier and the Council had told Lily to proceed with the
 
project, but it was to be Lily's project--not the Council's.  Then
 
he went into a big tirage against all people who werIin such a hurry
 
to get things done,  people wanted to make a dragon without council
 
approval, people wanted to make television film without council
 
approval, and now people from Washington D
.C. wanted to study the
 
school without Council approval.  I assured him that I
, as the local
 
representative of the people in Washington, only wanted to study
 
the school with the Council s approval.  And if that were impossible
 
because of scheduling difficulties, we wanted to do it with his
 
approval.  He reiterated his position that I could ask the Council
 
in June; that he had no tower to give approval himself.
 I reiterated
 
my position that I had a deadline that precluded waiting until June.
 
David ended the conversation with another tirade against people
 
who were always in a hurry:
 "And that's their problem, not mine."
 
I feel that I could  have gone out to the School the following
 
Sunday.
 I also felt that would allow me to to win a small battle
 
and lose a bigger war--if war is what had developed.  Then I decided
 
that if I went, war would develop.  So I opted not to go.
 
SA Chinese -

One month )
iter I decided to phone Ruth Lew and at least give
 
her the option of a final interview.
 I offered to give the School
 
a copy of the PM Magazine film and to give her copies of some slides
 
I had taken of the dragon in the Battle of Flowers Parade.  She
 
graciously accepted both offers.  She inquired if she might be able
 
to see a copy of the final report I was writing (I promised her
 
she could.)  She apologized for the lack of support I had encountered.
 
She did not volunteer for a personal interview.
 I did not compromise
 
her position by asking her for one.
 
My only means, then, of guessing at the current status of
 
the curriculum at the school is from viewing the PM Magazine film
 
and from interpreting notes gleaned from my first interview with
 
Lily Bailey, with amplification by Lily in the John Leung and
 
Sam Ng interviews.
 
The PM Magazine film makes no mention of langlEge classes.
 
A few Chinese characters are being drawn on the blackboard by
 
Ruth Lew and Ben Jin is showing a student a book.  But the impression
 
given to and by the television crew was that the school has placed
 
its emphasis on cultural activities other than language--particularly
 
upon dances.
 
In the intiial interview I had with Lily Baily, she explained
 
that the school at present had no principal; it is run by three
 
directors; it has three teachers (only two of whom she namedz
 
Ben Jin, who speaks no English, has retired from the restaurant
 
business, and teaches Toi San, and Mrs. Hoh, who teaches Mandarin
 
to seven or eight students.  The school has 5
5 student enrolled,
 
only seventeen or eighteen of whom attend the regular weekend classes.

In the interview with John Leung, Lily told John that the school
 
had no principal and met only on Sundays.  She reminded John that
 
the Council itself had no President in 1980 and 1981; David Lew
 
had been elected just this year.  This time she stated, again,
 
that Ben Jin was teaching Toi San, Mrs. Hoh Mandarin--but added
 
that Jimmy Eng was teaching Cantonese to three students.
 
However in the Sam Mg interview she stated that the three teachers
 
were "Dr. Lees wife, Ruth Lew, and Mrs. Hoh"--and that the seventeen
 
children who attended regularly were either children or grandchildren
 
of these three teachers.
 
Three people were presented as teachers in the PM Magazine film;
 
Ruth Lew, Ben Jin, and Jimmie Eng.
 
Apparently, then, since 1980 the enrollment of the
 
school has dropped from about 200 to about 50.  And apparently,
 
also, confusion on the Council itself and confusion in the school
 
have occurred during the same two-to-three year period.  Whether
 
Lily Bailey's resignation has been a cause or an effect of this
 
decreased support of the school is not clear.  John Leung summed
 
up the situation this ways
 "Even now, with Ms. Bailey not at the
 
school, the students have dropped so much because they don't have
 
the teacher up there, you know."
 
Clearly the vitality of the San Saba school is missing'the
 
present Rhapsody school.
 In his interview John was describing
 
to me the huge upstairs ballroom and meeting room of the San Saba
 
school; proud of how lavishly furni ed the entire building was.
 
Then he and Lily lamented how slowly all the lavish furnishings
 
have disappeared over the years.
 "And now the chairs are missing,"
 
she said to John.
 
SA Chinese -
 30
 
In trying to explain the decline in support of the present
 
school, John and Lily agreed that the biggest difference between
 
the 30's and the 80's was the dearth of activities for children then
 
compared to the proliferation of activities now.  Lily even went
 
into an extensive explanation of why she will not even let her
 
two boys, both of whom are over six feet tall, go out for high school
 
athletics.  Such non-essential activities interfere with the boys'
 
real purpose in schools study.
 
Rose Wu made the most complete attempt to articulate the difference
 
in support between the two schools: the basic unity of the Chinese
 
community has disappeared with  the influx of "outsiders"--people
 
today are "disacquainted."  Teachers are too expensive.  TV, Radio, and
 
school clubs interfere.
 "You can't repeat the 1930's," she said.
 
5
.  Future My own grasp of the potential of the school is lost
 
in the fog that hides the '
true make-up of the 3
,000 or so Chinese
 
living in San Antonio.  When I asked them what they thought the
 
potential of the school was, Lily said a good teacher would bring
 
enrollment back up to 200; Sam Ng said rather quietly that he
 
didn't know; John Leung just shrugged; Rose Wu said that as long
 
as two students were enrolled they'd keep the school--"for tax
 
purposes."  Houchi Dung said there was too much in-fighting, too
 
much politics for the health of the school.  He would, he said,
 
encourage people to go if they wanted to study Chinese.
 "But who
 
want to go?  The problem is, children can only play with Chinese."
 
And later, "It would be hard, under present financial situation,
 
to provide good language training in that place."  But, he added,
 
something is better than nothing.

Ewing Chinn, my colleague at Trinity, furnishes, perhaps, the
 
best long distance perspective.  He did seek me out to give his
 
views as a former student of a similar school in San Francisco.
 
His comments are striking because they were spontaneous, yet
 
fit in with the prevailing wisdom found among those of us who have
 
studied the assimilation of languages into dominant cultures:
 
After twelve years of school, Ewing made his parents stop sending
 
him.  He felt guilty because he skipped class more than he attended
 
it.  His teachers could have made it more interesting, perhaps--
they appeared to be teaching out of a sense of duty, duty to
 
the culture at large rather than to particular students.  Perhaps,
 
but most likely not, the renewed interest in ethnic heritage might
 
make language schools more possible now.  Still his observation is
 
that first generation people do not assimilate; second generation
 
people do; and third generation people are only passively interested
 
in their heritage--language learning is too much work.

THE CHINESE LANGUAGE SCHOOL IN SAN ANTONIO, T
hXAS
 
1
.  Rationale for study. In the Spring of 1
976 I organized and conducted
 
a three-day conference, "
Strategies for Inter-Ethnic Comrainication."
 
The conference was supported by a Grant from the Texas Corrinittee for
 
the Humanities, and was held in San Antonio, Texas.  During that con-
ference I net Lily Bailey, principal of the San Antonio Chinese
 
Corrrnunity School.  At that time we agreed that both of us would benefit
 
from a joint study of the school and its relationship to the San Antonio
 
coninunity.  When the Folklife Center initiated the Ethnic Language
 
School Project this Spring (
1982), I contacted Lily and we both agreed
 
this was a good opportunity for a follow-through study of the San
 
Antonio Chinese School.
 
After act
ii 1 work on the study began I learned that Lily was no
 
longer principal of the school.  Moreover the present personnel at the
 
school were not open to working with Lily on this particular project.
 
Initial disappoinULent has been replaced by wonder:  at the history of
 
the school and at the complexity of the Chinese corm-unity (
and its
 
relationship) to the school.
 
This report contains no description of classes being conducted.
 
It does contain a brief account of n
rj att
pts to get permission
 
(
denied) to describe the present classes; of first hand accounts of
 
students' experiences at the school from its conception in 1927 until
 
1980; of the history of and present make-up of the Chinese corm
-unity
 
SA Chinese -

in San Antonio; and, of a variety of vicarious descriptions of the
 
present school.
 
2
.  Persons interviewed. This report is based upon six for m
al, taped
 
interviews; four untaped interviews; and several untaped telephone
 
conversations.
 
2
.1.  Taped interviews. Rose Wu is the matriarch of the Chinese com-
munity in San Antonio.  She is firmly established within  the recognized
 
elite society of the city at large.  John Leung is a generation younger
 
than Rose; John is in his sixties.  Mary Eng is of the sarre generation
 
as John Leung.  Sam Ng and Houchi Dung are of a younger "generation-
set" than John Leung and Mary Eng.  Sam and Houchi are in their
 
fifties.  Sam is a n nber of the sane "Toi San" group of Chinese as
 
the older informants; Houchi is a marnber of the Taiwanese group.
 
Joanna Leung, daughter of John, is the youngest informant--in her
 
twenties.
 
Lily Bailey accorrpanied ma on four of these interviews.  Her
 
participation was discreet.  She was particularly adept at leading
 
us to fruitful topics.  In the interviews with John Leung and Sam Ng
 
her own comrents on the school curriculum from 1971 through 1
980
 
reinforce the infor m
ation she gave ma in untaped conversations.
 
Other persons who appear in these four taped interviews are:
 
Dora (
wife of John) in the John Leung interview; Joseph (
husband of
 
Mary) in the Nary Eng interview; Jane Sturtevant, secretary for
 
Sam Ng, in his interview; a public health nurse (
who does not talk,
 
SA Chinese -
 3
 
but does enter the room) in the Houchi Dung interview; and David
 
Trujillo, fiance of Joanna Leung, in her interview (
Sam Ng also enters
 
the restaurant during the Joanna Leung interview and exchanges grcct-
ings).
 
Rose Wu and Mary Eng were both interviewed in their homes.
 
Houchi Dung and Sam Ny were interviewed in their offices.  John Leung
 
and his daughter Joanna were interviewed in the Leung restaurant.
 
2
.2.  t
Jntaped interviews. My initial interview was with Lily Bailey
 
at her house.  Lily requested that the interview not be taped.  She
 
hoped at that tine that if her own role in the project were minimized
 
the administration of the school itself would consent to participating
 
in the study.  Because such participation did not occur and because
 
we were unable to schedule a taped interview at a later date, I have
 
transcribed all of Lily's contributions during the other interviews.
 
While this documentation procedure is certainly not as satisfactory
 
as an actual taped interview, it does isolate Lily's contributions for
 
easy reference.
 
During the initial interview with Lily she outlined a series of
 
interviews she had arranged for i
re.  I relied solely on these initial
 
contacts at the beginning of the research.  Later I interviewed other
 
persons I knew--but these interviews were solely of an informal nature.
 
Lily did not know for sure at this first interview that we would be
 
unable to visit the school itself--thus she did not tell me of the
 
problem.

The second untaped interview was with Bill Ng---one of those
 
interviews Lily arranged and participated in.  Bill wished to be
 
interviewed at his sotre--an orients 1 shop in the middle of the
 
Mexican Market, El Mercado, in downtown San Antonio.  Since the
 
market is extremely crowded and noisy, I made no attempt to record
 
the interview.
 
T
ho other interviews were not recorded.  Both conversations were
 
spontaneous and I was forced to make notes as soon after the interview
 
as possible.  Ewing Chinn, a professor of philosophy and a colleague
 
of mine at Trinity University, heard of the study and cornered i
re in
 
the Faculty Lounge.  He then told of his experiences attending a
 
Chinese language school as a child in San Francisco.  John Leung, Jr.,
 
who has done some of the professional photography work for this project
 
told t
ie in my office late one day of his experiences as a student of
 
Lily Bailey.
 
2
.3.  Telephone interviews. On the sane day she arranged our first
 
interview, Lily also arranged for i
re to visit the language school.
 
However Ruth Lea, the woman I was to visit, telephone the day of the
 
appointment to cancel it.  That was the first of six different
 
telephone conversations I had with Ms. L e
a.  I have made notes on
 
the conversations; I have yet to mact Ruth Lew.
 
The President of the Chinese Community Council is a man named
 
David Lew.  I conversed with David on the telephone one time.  He
 
vehemently denied i
re permission to attend the school.  I have made
 
SA Chinese -
 5
 
notes from that conversation.
 
3
.  The San Antonio Chinese community. The comments in this section
 
are included only insofar as they contribute to the understanding of
 
the language school and its relationship to the Chinese community.
 
I have made no attempt to systematically describe the make-up,
 
historic lly or synchronically, of the Chinese Community.  I have
 
included in the documentation a couple of popular suirnaries of the
 
Texas (
including San Antonio) Chinese corrinunities.  Both nonographs
 
are published by the Institute of Texas Cultures and both containing
 
initial bibliographies for future study.  However, during the inter-
viewing I did notice certain comments on the make-up of the Chinese
 
community which either clarified the present situation in the language
 
school or contained references to the history of the community which
 
were at variance with the documentation in the Institute studies.
 
3
.1.  History. The first Chinese language lessons were offered in
 
the early twenties through the outgrowth of Sunday School lessons at
 
the Chinese Baptist Church.  About 1
927 a group of ten Chinese business-
man bought a building on San Saba Street, in downtown San Antonio.
 
Language lessons were formalized and expanded.  Shortly after that a
 
second group of Chinese opened another language school in a building
 
already owned by so m
a Chinese Free Masons.
 
None interviewed seemed to know when the Free Masons' lessons
 
stopped; all aujeed that in the middle fifties an urban renewal projec
 
SA Chinese -
 6
 
forced the sale of the San Saba building, which in turn terminated
 
formal language lessons.
 
No Chinese language lessons were offered consistently until
 
about 1970, when the group associated with the San Saba school opened
 
classes on Saturdays at Trinity University.  Trinity is centrally
 
located in San Antonio--just north of downtown.  In 1972 a new building
 
was purchased in a suburb on the far North side of town, on Rhapsody
 
Street.  Weekend classes continued on a large scale until 1980, when
 
Lily Bailey resigned as principal of the school.  At present mini m
al
 
classes are held for a couple of hours each Sunday.
 
These various language classes have been supported by Chinese
 
descended from the earliest settlers in San Antonio--those from the
 
Southern China area of Toi San.  Lily Bailey and Bill Eng e laine
 
that these Southern Chinese spoke a dialect known as the To! San
 
dialect.  It did not (
and still does not) have the prestige of the
 
other main Southern Chinese dialect, Cantonese (
also spoken in
 
Hong Kong).  Lily r
rentioned that Cantonese has its own literature;
 
Toi San does not.  According to Bill, r
rost of the first Chinese to
 
settle in the United States were from the To! San area, and settled
 
r
rcstly in the Middle and Southern parts of the United States.  Later
 
i
nrnigrants, who spoke Cantonese, settled on the East and West coasts
 
of the United States.  Not until after the first Japanese invasion of
 
China were there many i
rrniigrants from Northern China, where Mandarin
 
SA Chinese -
 7
 
is spoken.
 (At present, the official language of Mainland China is
 
Mandarin.)  The Toi San people, in general, were and are associated
 
with the peasantry; the Cantonese and Mandarin with Middle and Upper
 
Middle class.
 
Throughout the course of this study I was aware of mixed foclings
 
of acceptance and rejection by this San Antonio Toi San group toward
 
South Texans toward other Chinese.
 
In corrrnenting on the group's identity in San Antonio, Rose Wu
 
observed that the Chinese had always mingled with the rest of the
 
coimunity; she pointed out that they were invited to make a dragon
 
for the early R ttle of Flower parades and they are still being asked
 
to do so.  However Mary Eng spoke openly of racial prejudice in
 
Shreveport, Louisiana (
where Chinese were segregated into the sane
 
schools as were Negroes) and gave one extended anecdote relating her
 
problems in finding a neighborhood in which to build a house in
 
San Antonio---without running into racial prejudice.  And Rose Wu,
 
herself, relates with considerable pride the role she took in State
 
legislative action that allowed all Chinese, whether naturalized
 
citizens or not, to own private (
real estate) property.
 
Coupled with this ambivalence about acceptance is an apparent
 
a
mbivalence about emotional roots; with San Antonio or with China.
 
At the end of his interview, John and Dora Leung and Lily Bailey were
 
talking about bow deep the roots in San Antonio were.  As John put it:
 
"
In San Antonio .
 .
 .
 the Chinese ooire and stay in San Antonio."
 
However in a later interview with Sam Ng, Sam mentioned that his main
 
purpose in learning Chinese was to allow him to return to China to work
 
and to live.  Mary Eng talked of her earlier desire to be a missionary
 
to China.  Lily agreed that this return-to--China motivation was
 
pervasive.  She explained —more to Sam Ng than to i
re--the meaning of
 
an old Chinese proverb:
 
The Chinese people have a saying:  "No matter how
 
tall the tree is, the leaves always cone down to the
 
roots."  That means, when you are a Chinese, no matter
 
how far the country is, where you go to work, you still
 
come back to the original dirt.  To be buried.  So that '
s
 
the way we have in our minds.  Even when we were young.
 
When you memorize the classical verse, there is one like
 
that.  The leaves will come back to the roots.
 
Houchi Dung echoes this ambivalence when talking about his own emo-
tional ties.  He feels that his two boys will both become completely
 
Americanized; marry non-Chinese Americans and eventually lose their
 
Chinese identity.  However Houchi and his wife both hope to r
 :
 
Taiwan within the decade, and live there the rest of their li o.
 
Overall the ambivalence has never seemed to be other than ex-
pected.  The Chinese community's involvement in social activities has
 
shown a healthy balance of cultures.  Pose Wu, Mary Eng, John Leung
 
and Sam Ng have all served as officers in both all-Chinese and non-
Chinese civic and social organizations.

.2  Present. The most obvious and also the most important difference
 
between the Chinese community of the thirties (
that supported the San
 
Saba school) and the Chinese community of today (
that supports the
 
Rhapsody school)  is the ethnic complexity of the present corrrnunity.
 
In 1927 all Chinese in San Antonio were from southern China and spoke
 
Toi San.  Today the Toi San speakers constitute only one of two neclei
 
for the Chinese coiuiiiunity.  And neither nucleus attracts a clear
 
majority of the Chinese community.  At the end of the interview with
 
Pose Wu, Lily Bailey cai
irr nted on this present-day diversity.
 
You soc [in Pose's] ti m
e, all the Chinese that would
 
come .
 .
 .
 over to San Antonio.  Stay here.  They
 
feel part.
 [Today they just] feel acquainted.  And
 
another thing:  Too many outside people.  That move
 
from San Francisco.  That move from Taiwan, Hong Kong
 
move over here.  They don't want to feel.  And this
 
other group, the grocery store and people like that,
 
feel like they are inferior.  But they are not.  Be-
cause their children all have more education.  They
 
and the people that come from Taiwan and Hong Kong.
 
•
 .
 .
 .We have, now, including the outside people,
 
we have about thL o
c thousand people here.  But some
 
from Puerto Rico, and some from Vietnam.
 
Twice during this explanation, Rose Wu interrupted with comments of
 
agreement.
 
In the mid1  
e fifties this "
inside" Toi San group--the group Lily
 
referred to as "the grocery store and people like that" y
.ruup--decided
 
to organize the Chinese Community Council, apparently of and for the
 
Toi San group alone.  The Council consisted originally of nineteen
 
members:  today the Council still has ninteen members on its execu-
tive board.  For the Toi San group, membership on this 19-member
 
board appears to be i
irportant.  John Leung was the Council's first
 
President.  Lily Riley was elected a member of the Council in 1
971
 
and still serves on the council in 1982.  When Lily explained to me
 
who we were to interview, she told me that all except Bill Eng had
 
served on the Council.
 (
Houchi Dung also has not served on the
 
Council.)
 This Council was responsible for the sale of the San Saba
 
school and for the purchase of the Rhapsody school.  Fifteen years
 
elapsed between the sale of the f oin e r  and the purchase of the latter.
 
During those fifteen years little, if any, language instruction took
 
place.  In my a t tempt s  to discover what did take place during those
 
f i f t e e n y e a rs,  I discovered nothing but wonderment and silence.
 
Sam Ng finally explained my inability to penetrate the (
9A -kness by
 
stating that nothing happened:
 "
It's simple, Scott.  If you don't
 
want something to get done, give it to a c o m m i tt e e.
" 
When I first contacted Lily Bailey about this study she suggested
 
I contact Houchi Dung.  Houchi is a medical doctor and an associate
 
SA Chinese -
 11
 
professor of Anatomy at The University of Texas Medical Center in San
 
Antonio.  Born in Taiwan ! Houchi went to Medical School in Louisville,
 
Kentucky, in the late fifties.  He moved to San Antonio in the late
 
sixties.  A staunch supporter of the Corrrnunist  regi m
e in Mainland
 
China, Houchi was invited to visit the mainland in 1973.  The visit
 
so depressed Houchi that his political views reversed i
nn diately.
 
Upon his return to the United States he began to organize and eventually
 
founded a San Antonio chapter of the Taiwan Benevelent Society.  This
 
new organization began to immediately attract some of the newer members
 
of the Chinese corrmunity in San Antonio.
 
The differences between the two groups, the Taiwanese and the
 
Toi San, are many and deep.  Houchi was insistent in avoiding any dis-
cussion of the Toi San group, dismissing them with:
 
It's re
a
l
ly very simple.  People who are interested in
 
that place [Rhapsody School] are not high caliber or
 
heavyweight people from Chinese community here.  Of
 
course, just like every other minority, you need a
 
place to identify.
 
I learned the situation
 
very quickly and decide there is no nccd to associate
 
with that place.
 
Houchi was the last person I planned to interview.
 In response to
 
his queries about how the study had gone, I confessed my frustration
 
at being unable to actually visit the school.  His reaction was that
 
I had done no worse than he would have done. His own inability to beco m
 
integrated wholly into the Chinese co miunitY in San Antonio was apparent,
 
but he clai m not to be bothered by it.
 
"My problem, " he told me, "is that they think I am ComTunist. ,
, 
His analysis m y be correct.  But the day after the interview I returned
 
to Bill Eng at the El Mercado to take so m pictures.  When Bill learned
 
that I had talked to Houchi, he gave me a rather lengthy and passionate
 
anti-Taiwan talk.  While his dislike was for cultural, not political,
 
reasons, he obviously did not dismiss Houchi Dung for being connunist--
rather for being Taiwanese.
 
Within the Toi San Chinese a generational, linguistic gap has oc-
cured--similar to that of most im-n
igrant Populations.  The grandparents
 
speak only Chinese, the grandchildren speak only English.  Lily Bailey,
 
John Leung, and Joanna Leung all co mented on the phenomenon. All agree

John Leung, in which he and Dora recall, fondly, how John and all his
 
siblings were given English and Christian names by the minister's wife
 
at the Chinese Baptist Church.)
 
Whatever the present corr lexities of the Chinese coimiunity in
 
San Antonio, those I have interviewed do seen pleased with their lives
 
in the city.  John Leung stated toward the end of his interview:
 
There is no China Town, there is no central part where
 
they live.  Everybody's spread out.  But then the only
 
gathering they do is going to the club meetings, and
 
council meetings, and things like that.  And the func-
tions that they have.
 
And Dora added:
 "or weddings, or babies' one month old parties.
"
 
3
.3.  Personal. In the taped interviews, untaped interviews, and
 
telephone conversations occasional, personal corr m
ants would occur.
 
While duly noting and documenting such coiiiuents, I made notes to de-
lete at a later date.  However, when I approached the various (
that is,
 
all) people involved, I was invariably told not to delete or omit any-
thing.  This lack of help in the editing process bothered t
ie.
 Again,
 
Bill Eng cane to r
r
ry rescue.  "Why are you bothered?" he asked.  "
If
 
people said anything to you, they knew it was for permanent record.  If
 
you decide to edit, you may not be editing as much as censoring."
 
For the record, then, separate documentation will give details
 
about the personal lives of an comments about most of the people in-
volved in the study.  Rose Wu has some delightful anecdotes about her
 
SA Chinese -
 14
 
childhood in Arizona and her decision to move with her husband to the
 
"
r
rudhole" which was San Antonio in the early thirties.  John Leung
 
talks about his and f
l
o
r
a
's wedding in San Antonio
 
—
either the first or
 
second Chinese wedding in the city.  Mary Eng discusses in great length
 
her childhood in Louisiana, her childhood visits to China, and her
 
nuney-gathering efforts through a racially prejudiced South during the
 
Japanese invasion of China.  Sam Ng talks about his family and his
 
various businesses.  Bill Eng tells about his leaving the restaurant
 
business in 1957 and about his wife's background in Hong Kong.  Houchi
 
Dung gives an extended discussion of his conversion from one Chinese
 
political ideology to its opposite, t1  
ks about his one visit to
 
Mainland China and subsequent two visits to Taiwan, and candidly talks
 
about his family (
and his wife '
s family) both in Taiwan and in the
 
United States.  Joanna Leung talks about her siblings, about college
 
(
with a delightful anecdote concerning her genetic background--a dis-
cussion between her and a classmate in a biology class, where Joanna
 
thought the question referred to her academic background in biology),
 
and--with her fiance joining in--discusses the proble m of planning a
 
wedding in the United States between a Mexican-American and a Chinese-
American, and how they plan to raise their children with a tn -cultural
 
heritage.
 
In the interview with Sam Ng, Lily Bailey talks about the diffi-
culties she had in memorizing the tables she needed to use with an
 
abacus.  Not on tape, but important for this report, Lily told i
re about
 
SA Chinese -
 15
 
her childhood in the Philippines, about her attempts to learn (
and to
 
master) all three Chinese languages/dialects (
Toi San, Cantonese,
 
Mandarin), about her marriage to a very tall Indiana man with a Ph.D.
 
in Classical Chinese, and about the nove from Indiana to San Antonio in
 
the late 1
960's.
 
3
.4.  Chinese Baptist Church. During the course of the interview with
 
John Leung, Lily Bailey made an important observation:
 Most of the
 
meetings are at big restaurants or to the school.  Or to the Church.
 
And it's all connected.  It's the only church."  The Church she referred
 
to, a
1mst as an afterthought, was the Chinese Baptist Church.  This
 
Baptist Church, along with a couple of references to other Chinese
 
Baptist churches, appears as a unifying thread throughout the various
 
interviews.
 
Lily mentioned to me at one time that now that she is no longer
 
principal of the language school, she has been able to become more
 
active in the Chinese Baptist Church again.  She also mentioned in the
 
Sam Ng interview that she had given free Chinese conversation lessons
 
to some Americans who wished to become missionaries to China.
 
As mentioned above, John Leung and his siblings were all named
 
by the minister's wife at the Baptist Church.  Both John and Dora
 
lamented that their strong participation in the Chinese Baptist Church
 
has suffered as a consequence of their decision to conve r
t their gro-
cery store into a restaurant ten ye rs ago.  Now that the restaurant
 
is established, they suggested (
on tape) that they rczf
l  
ly should get
 
SA Chinese -
 16
 
r
rore involved again.  They also
 ndered, at one point, if the Chinese
 
Language School rrnl  
ly had not developed out of the Church.
 
Rose Wu, whose husband was one of the first teachers in the San
 
Saba school, stated (
in a later interview) that indeed the first lessons
 
had grown out of a Sunday School class at the Chinese Baptist Church.
 
Joanna Leung mentioned that the main reason she attended Chinese lan-
guage classes (
at Trinity) was to be with her peers from the Church--
she attended the church more for social than religious purposes.
 
Mary Eng talked about her youth in Shreveport, Louisiana, and
 
how the Baptist Church was an integral part of that childhood.  She also
 
mentioned her early desire to be a missionary to China.
 
Even Houchi Dung, the Taiwanese outsider, was baptized in a
 
Baptist Church in Taiwan.
 (
Although, he is quick to say, he is not a
 
member of a Chinese Baptist Church now--or any church for that matter.)

.  Chinese Language Schools in San Antonio. Although the data have
 
been fragnentaxy and anecdotal, for the most part, it has been possible
 
to extract from the various interviews, taped and otherwise, a rough
 
"oral history" description of the six different language schools that
 
have existed in San Antonio since the middle twenties.  While the lin-
guist in i
re has been totally disappointed in this research, the soci-
ologist, folklorist, and resident of San Antonio have been amply re-
warded.

.1.  Chinese Baptist Church. Rose Wu, the matriarch, the person John
 
Leung imrediately said I should talk to about the history of the school,
 
SA Chinese -
 17
 
was adarrent in her interpretation that the first language lessons were
 
an outgrowth of Sunday School classes in the Chinese Baptist Church.
 
"Mrs. Murray taught," she said.
 "It was first s- rted at the Baptist
 
Church, which was ups1-d  
rs in a building, over a restaurant and a bar."
 
Lily Bailey was delighted at the recollection:
 
Most of the people say San Saba  was the first school
 
but I rerrernber talking to one or two people.  They say
 
started over a bar.  Then they  other people  laugh at
 
me, you know.  Toi Mei was very old too.  I think she
 
told me because her husband was very active.
 
4
.2.  San Saba. All agree that the San Saba school was the first to
 
have its own building and its own full time teachers.  In the publi-
cations f 
r
um the Institute of Texan Cultures, pictures of the San Saba
 
school are prominent.  When I first walked into John Leung '
s restaurant,
 
his wife Dora had an old album which she (
and Lily) thought was from the
 
first years of that school.
 (We subsequently learned that the album
 
was fiQn the Chinese War Refugee Relief drive and that the persons in-
volved (
as well as the building) were from the San Saba group.)  john
 
and Dora Leung asked if I could get a copy of a picture of the San
 
Saba building which was hanging on the wall of a Mexican restaurant on
 
the near North Side of town.
 (
The owner of that restaurant, Carlos
z
 
Pena, has cooperated.  When he was a child, his father took him dowr
 
to the San Saba area (
the picture in question is dated 1964) to take
 
pictures of the neighborhood before urban renewal destroyed it.  Carlos
 
SA Chinese -
 18
 
had often wondered if that was the Chinese school.  He seemed glad to
 
learn it was and to allow us to make copies of the picture.)
 
The infor m
ation on the San Saba school has co m
a fran throc pri-
mary sources:  Mary Eng and Rose Wu were both in San Antonio at or
 
the ti m
a the school started;  John Leung and Sam Ng both attended
 
school--John in the thirties and Sam in the forties; and Lily Bailey
 
had heard stories about the school during her twelve or thirteen years
 
in the city.
 
Both John Leung's father and san Ng' s grandfather were among ten
 
Chinese business m
an who each contributed about $500 each for the pur-
chase of the building on San Saba--a location that Mary Eng described
 
as being in the west neighborhood (
to San Antonio people that is syn-
onyrrous with Mexican) near grocery row.  John Leung articulated the
 
founding this way:
 "There was about ten.. .
businessmen, Chinese business-
man, here in town that decided that we need a Chinese school for the
 
youngsters here, see.
 '
Cause all the kids were growing up and no one
 
was speaking Chinese."  According to Mary, from the school's conception
 
and through the forties the teachers and the school itself were closely
 
tied in with the Chinese Baptist Church.
 
As mentioned earlier the building itself served purposes other
 
than that of a school alone.  Birthday parties, weddings, Chinese New
 
Year parties, and "Double Ten" (
October tenth--the date of Chinese
 
Independence Day) parties were also held in the building.  Mary Eng also
 
SA Chinese -
 19
 
remembers a Drum and Bugle C0LpS that met in the building.  She and her
 
husband Joseph also sponsored a student center in the building.  The
 
center expanded into a Youth Club during the war years in the forties.
 
This Youth Club served as a meeting place for the nunerous Chinese
 
soldiers and Air Force personnel associated with San Antonio's five
 
military installations.
 
The taped interviews indicate sa
ne confusion about whether the
 
teachers were volunteers or were hired.  Mary Eng and Lily Bailey
 
thought no one was hired until about 1971.  But Rose Wu, John Leung,
 
and Sam Ng a
ll agree that the San Saba teachers were paid.
 "They were
 
all hired," Sam said, "but some were real, REAL, teachers and some
 
were just hired."  According to Rose Wu, her husband Ted was the first
 
teacher at the San Saba school, but after the two of them were married,
 
he quit teaching and went into business.
 
Both John and Sam went to school every weekday from 4
:30 until
 
6
:30 p
.m., then they would go hone and do the homework from the American
 
school.  The Chinese school required no ho m
ework.  But John and Sam
 
studied Chinese h
istory and culture.  But mostly they stiic1ied language.
 
Reading and writing were learned from regular Mainland China textbooks.
 
About every two months, the school would have an open house for parents.
 
Writing samples were displayed on the walls, plays were given, debates
 
were held.  As John put it, "Our parents were very proud."
 
The real core of those San Saba lessons, though, appears to be
 
SA Chinese -
 20
 
the study of Classical Chinese.  John explained that after six years in
 
the school he began to study the classical; which was all I
re
.rrDry work,
 
and none of which he could remember today.
 "It's been so long, I
 
forgot.  I
'm being tru
 ul " he told Lily Bailey, laughing as he did
 
so.  I asked both John and Lily, and later Sam, if any of them could
 
remember any of the content of those classical lessons.  They all said
 
they could not.
 I asked if any of the contents of those classical
 
works had been translated into English, so their children--or even they
 
themselves--would have access to the meaning.  Lily said that her
 
husband, Roger, has translated a few of them.  But no one seems to be
 
interested in publishing.
 
Sam recalled these lessons fondly, however.
 "We really studied
 
hard.  A lot of memory work.  But I can't remember any of it.  Really,
 
I just went there to play."
 
Joanna Leung dismissed the whole study of the classical Chinese
 
with:
 "
Sam and Daddy studied Mandarin; the classical Chinese."
 
Whatever the content, or method of teaching, or hours of school,
 
the San Saba school appeared to thrive for its roughly thirty ye rs of
 
existence.  At one point in his interview, John Leung turned to Lily
 
Bailey and said:
 
We had two classes, Ms. Bailey, had too many students,
 
had two classes.  Later on it was made into another
 
class for the younger ones.  Then they separated into
 
SA Chinese -
 21
 
Beginners and Older ones, see?  We had two teachers
 
then.  This was about eight or ten years, later.  We
 
had two teachers.
 
Of particular importance to the establishment and maintenance of
 
an ethnic language school is the motivation:  the motivation of those
 
who establish the school and those who attend it.  The San Saba school
 
was est h l
lshed out of a variety of motivations:  As Mary Eng implied
 
and Lily Bailey supported, racial segregation may have forced the
 
Chinese into furnishing a place for their children to gather after
 
school.
 
The racial problem is arguable and sensitive to discuss.  The
 
need to gather after school is not.  Most of the Tol San people were
 
in the grocery business, and each grocery store was basically a family
 
store.  As a consequence, both parents worked early morning until
 
eight or so in the evening.  The older children could and did, of
 
course, work in the store after school.  The younger ones needed a
 
place to gather with sate type of supervision.  During the Mary Eng
 
interview, Lily Bailey explained to i
re:
 "They had no activities, no-
where to go.  So therefore they all had to go to the Chinese school."
 
Sam Ng stated that basically the school served as a baby sitting function.
 
But underneath it all was the motivation, expressed by John Leung
 
above, that the founders of the school were worried that their children
 
were not learning Chinese.
 
SA Chinese -
 22
 
While both John and Sam stated that they were forced to go, by
 
their parents, both agreed they had fun and looked back on those years
 
fondly.  Sam regretted that his playful nature with a particular
 
teacher had him expelled from the school permanently after ten years
 
of attendance.
 
One final motivating force should be mentioned, since it does
 
occur in the literature of other language schools.  Sam stated that
 
he and his brothers were expected to learn Chinese so that once they
 
grew up and became engineers or professionally trained in a practical
 
skill they could return and offer their expertise to the development
 
of China.  This sane motivation was not expected of his sisters.
 
"I think the way it started.  The reason I think it started:  just
 
like my parents, my daddy, see, he wanted us to go back to China."
 
When I asked Sam if his father expected to return himself, he answered:
 
"Only to visit.
"
 
When I
 asked if he or any of his brothers did go back
 
to work, he said no.
 
But the San Saba school's days did co m
a to a close.
 "Urban
 
Renewal" bought the place out, according to the usual rhetoric.  Early
 
in our interview process, misled somewhat, I believe, by the fact that
 
the pictures showed the San Saba building still standing in 1964, we
 
thought the building had been sold in the middle sixties.  Lily turned
 
to ma during the Mary Eng interview and started to explain:
 "Hemisphere
 
started buying the property so they, uh, sold it."  Mary interrupted
 
her:
 "No.  They sold it before then, before 1968."  But Mary could
 
SA Chinese -
 23
 
reconstruct no better than that.
 
Several interviews later Lily posed the question to Rose
 
was the San Saba school sold?  Some people told me 1952.  Yester-
day I hear 1958.  And I heard also one said 1954.  But I knew it was
 
in the middle fifties."  Rose answered; not too definitively:  "The
 
expressway bought San Saba about twenty-five years
 . "
 
4
.3.  Masonic School. Not long after the San Saba school opened a
 
second language school began.  I have referred to this second school
 
as the Masonic School; most refer to it as the "other" school.  In
 
responding to Lily Bailey's question about why the second school
 
started, Rose Wu said:  "Oh, gossip started that school.  Someone
 
thought the San Saba school was making money."
 
When Lily told Sam Ng that I had had an interview with Bill Eng,
 
Sam laughed and said; "Oh, he went to that '
other' school.  The rich
 
kid's school."
 
Bill Eng' s own good humored and low-key explanation is as follows.
 
During the early Toi San days in San Antonio there were no Chinese
 
lawyers, so the two biggest '
families,' the Lees and the Ngs formed
 
organizations, or associations, referred to as Tongs to handle business
 
matters.  There were, in San Antonio, a few '
Tong' fights, but certainly
 
no Tong wars.
 
After the Ng Tong founded the San Saba school, the Lee Tong decided
 
to hold classes in the building in which they held most of their
 
r
rcctings, the Free Mason building on the corner of Houston and Laredo
 
SA Chinese -
 24
 
in downtown San Antonio.
 
They had old fashioned teachers; many grades in one room.  The
 
school lasted from the late 1930's to the middle 1940's.  Bill had only
 
one teacher, Lee Sat Ping.  They mat weekdays from 4
:00 until 8
:00 p.m.;
 
Saturdays 9
:00 until noon.  Lee Sat Ping was hired full time. They had
 
about 20 to 30 students, Bill went to the school for seven or eight
 
years.
 
Each child brought a Chinese book from his own home (
the parents
 
could choose the book) and the teacher would help the child read the
 
book.  They also studied brush writing and, later, Classical Chinese.
 
And, no, he could not remember any of the classical Chinese, either.
 
All he could re
nember was that they merrcrized words and repeated them to
 
the teacher.
 
4
.4.  Interim Classes. Apparently one major reason for forming the
 
Chinese Council was to handle the business transactions connected with
 
the sale of the San Saba building, in the middle fifties.  In any case,
 
the money from the sale of the building lay dormant until the purchase
 
of the Rhapsody property in 1971.  During those fifteen years, no one
 
seems to be certain about whether or not Chinese language classes were
 
held.
 
Sam Ng was a member of the Council during that fifteen year period
 
and all he remembers for sure was that a man naited Joe Chew initiated
 
the steps to begin teaching classes on Saturdays in rented space at
 
Trinity University.  Both Rose Wu and Mary Eng claim that classes were
 
SA Chinese -
 25
 
held during that intervening tine.  Base has no idea where they were
 
held, but fools sure that classes were held.  Mary Eng says that in
 
1955, she is almost certain, classes were held at the Chinese Baptist
 
Church.  Mary drove in a car pool until her mother-in-law arrived from
 
China in that year.  Mary also remembers making a float for a parade in
 
the late fifties with students from the Chinese language classes.  The
 
float was built at her house; she does not know where the classes mat.
 
.
5.  Trinity University. Joe Chew did begin the classes at Trinity and
 
:s principal of the Chinese language school.  What really occurred in
 
those classes seems confusing even to Lily Bailey:  in my interview
 
with Sam Ng she tried to explain this way:
 
Joe had several teachers, agree to teach, like Chinn.  He
 
has a grocery store .
 .
 .
 Elaine, she promise to teach,
 
but Joe open up the school there was no teacher.  That's
 
how they got ma, to fill up the three classes into one.
 
Because they had Elaine Chinn, Ed Mock's wife, and Joe
 
Chew's wife and somebody else.  Five classes.  Well then,
 
when school started, enrollment and everything else, nobody
 
showed up.  And so that's why they called me.  And then
 
they mix the other three classes.  So I taught the
 
Cantonese class and his wife taught the older group.
 
During a conversation with Mary Eng, Lily stated that Mandarin
 
classes were started, by Lily, at Trinity in 1971--that until that time
 
SA Chinese -
 26
 
Mandarin had not been taught in any of the San Antonio schools.  In
 
the interview with John Leung, Lily explained to me that they had
 
met for two years, at Trinity, but only during the summer.
 "T
ho days
 
a week and Saturdays for about two hours."
 
Both Lily and John thought that John Leung, Jr., had attended both
 
years at Trinity.  But when I talked to John Jr., he said he had only
 
gone for about one month, one summer.  He thought Mrs. Bailey was a
 
good teacher, but he wanted to study calligraphy or painting (
at which
 
Lily Bailey excels) but she only showed them how on one occasion.  He
 
thought that the Chinese Readers, which were of a "
See Dick Run" level
 
were humiliating.  He really enrolled in the course so he could learn
 
conversational Chinese, in order to carmunicate with his grandmother.
 
When he asked his folks if he could quit, they said yes.
 "I'm really
 
interested, now," he said.
 "But not then, I was only 12 years old and
 
didn't know."
 
4
.6.  Rhapsody, 1972-1980. Lily Rn
iley served as principal of the
 
Chinese Language School from 1972 until 1980.  While she gave me the
 
names of over a dozen students for interviewing, all of the students
 
were out of town.  Some had moved away.  Others were attending college
 
away from San Antonio.  During the last week of my research, Joanna
 
Leung returned from college to get married.  She agreed to an interview.
 
Unfortunately, Joanna could remember little of the school days--
she could not even remember if all of her classes (
she attended for
 
two years) were held at Rhapsody or if some were held at Trinity.  She
 
SA Chinese -
 27
 
did not remember anything about the classes themselves.  All she knew
 
for sure was that she must have gone when she was in elementary school,
 
because she remembers several things from her middle school days and
 
binese school "is not part of those memories."  She also went because
 
'ht it wo u
ld please her parents:  "They are pro-ethnic.  They
 
chool when they were young and it was a good thing
.  So.. .
they
 
i
de me go."  Her main reason for going, as mentioned earlier in the re-
)
rt, was to spend more time with her friends, especially a cousin, from
 
i
e Chinese Baptist Church.
 
Apparently the Trinity school did well enough that the Chinese
 
Camiunity Council decided to take the money from the sale of the San Saba
 
school and invest in new property.  According to Pose Wu, language in-
struction was not as important a factor as tax purposes; by investing the
 
San Saba money they would be monetarily ahead.  Rose was opposed to the
 
particular site chosen--it was too far north in the city for those chil-
dren living in the south side of town.  But, she said, "The younger people
 
wanted it, so I went along."  Lily, Pose, and Mary Eng, among others
 
added some of their own money to that of the San Saba trust for the pur-
chase of the Rhapsody property.  Each year, the Chinese CaTrnunity Council
 
sponsors an eggroll booth at the surr
irrer Texas Folklife Festival and
 
raises enough money to pay the taxes on the new property and building.
 
Joe Chew was elected Vice President of the Cormminity Council in 1972.
 
That created a vacancy in the Principalship of the language SchooL  Lily
 
becam
rincipal.  Soon after, Joe Chew left the United States and returned
 
SA Chinese -
 28
 
to Taiwan.  During the following eight years, enrollment (
and attendance)
 
in the classes ranged from a low of sixty to a high of 220.  Adults, as
 
well as children attended the classes.  Chinese speakers of Cantonese
 
and Toi San cane to learn Mandarin.  And a small y
roup 0- Anglos attended
 
classes for two ycc
irs; to become missionarieE
 
Lily Bailey's principalship of the langu
 
been absolute, authoritarian, and thoroughly professional.  She was a
 
member of the national Chinese Language Teacher's Association.  She has
 
furnished i
re copies of school newsletters and bulletins from the Chinese
 
Baptist Church, which partially document the content of the courses.
 
She clearly developed a balance of conversational and written materials.
 
In the interview with John Leung, she explained several times her own
 
methods of teaching:  mixing recitation with brush writing, displaying
 
writing samples during parties at the Rhapsody building, and developing
 
competition among the various classes--an explanation that prompted
 
John to turn to i
re and say:
 "That's the difference of a good teacher
 
or.. .
and a 
.
.. just run of the mill."  In a private conversation, Lily
 
explained to i
re that she ordered some materials fr o
m San Francisco
 
(
bibliographic information is included with this report) and wrote
 
some materials--the latter she gave to the school when she resigned in
 
1980.
 
4
.7.  Rhapsody, 1980-1982. Sometime in 1980, Lily Bailey resigned as
 
principal of the language school.  Her explanation to i
re was that she
 
got tired of all the dissatisfaction, built up over the years.  Houchi
 
Dung's explanation was that she was forced out.  The pressure was so
 
SA Chinese -
 29
 
intense that he had encouraged her to resign years earlier.  Sam Ng's
 
explanation was that she got a "raw deal."
 
All three admit that the resignation was unpleasant, harmful to the
 
enrollment at the school, and the result of petty infighting and politics
 
on the part of the Chinese Corrrnunity Council.
 
Clearly the most personally frustrating element in the study of the
 
Chinese language school has been my inability to study "The School."
 
Houchi Dung assures me that had I been able to work with the principles
 
involved with the school itself, I would not have learned as much about
 
either the history of the school or the complexity of the present
 
Chinese community.  While such assurances help to soothe my frustration,
 
they may not necessarily be true.  What is true, is that I was able to
 
talk to only two people involved d
irectly with the present school, and
 
I was able to do that only by telephone.
 
Lily Bailey arranged early in the project for me to visit the
 
language school on Sunday, April 18, 1982.  At 2
:00 p.m. on that day,
 
the students would be working on a dragon, which they would use in the
 
upcoming Battle of Flowers Parade.  At 10:00 a
.m. on the day of my
 
appointment, Ruth Lew phoned to cancel the photography session.  In
 
fact, she seemed surprised that I had intended to take photographs.  She
 
did ask that I phone back, and gave her num ber.
 
The following day she phoned again (
I was not in) and left a message
 
that she would "like to explain things."  I did not  reach her until
 
two days later.  In that conversation she explained that the school
 
itself had not had a principal since Lily Bailey had resigned--that it
 
SA Chinese -
 30
 
was now run by a committee of three persons.  She did not name any of
 
the three.  She said that the three were not qualified, but were willing
 
to "do it."  She also volunteered that later in the month, the television
 
program PM Magazine would air so m
e film they had just taken at the
 
School.
 (
The local ABC station later donated a copy of the footage
 
to this project.)  And she suggested that I telephone David Lew,
 
president of the Community Council to get permission to attend the
 
last session of the school, which would be meeting on the following
 
Sunday.
 
I was able to reach Mr. Lew by phone later that evening.  He was
 
extre m
ely upset at my call.  He could not believe Ruth Lew had asked
 
me to call; he was shocked when I said I wanted to talk to Ruth because
 
she was a teacher at the school (
"Ruth is a teacher?  Who told you Ruth
 
was a teacher?  She' s not a teacher at the school."); he said he would
 
not give me permission nor deny me permission to attend the Sunday class,
 
because he could not without the entire Council's approval, and the
 
Council did not meet again until June.
 
If I understood him correctly, Lily Bailey had asked the Council's
 
approval earlier and the Council had told Lily to proceed with the
 
project, but it was to be Lily's project--not the Council's.  Then he
 
went into a big tirade against all people who were in such a hurry to get
 
things done:  people wanted to make a dragon without council approval,
 
people wanted to make television film without council approval, and
 
now people fran Washington D
.C. wanted to study the school without
 
SA Chinese -
 31
 
Council approval.  I assured him that I
, as the local representative
 
of the people in Washington, only wanted to study the school with
 
the Council's approval.  And if that were impossible because of
 
scheduling difficulties, we wanted to do it with his approval.  He
 
reiterated his position that I could ask the Council in June; that
 
he had no power to give approval himself.  I reiterated r
rw position
 
that I had a deadline that precluded waiting until June.  David ended
 
the conversation with another tirade against people who were always
 
in a hurry:
 "And that's their problem, not mine.
 
I feel that I could have gone out to the School the following
 
Sunday.  I also felt that would allow i
re to win a small battle and
 
lose a bigger war--if war is what had developed.  Then I decided that
 
if I went, war would develop.  So I opted not to go.
 
One month later I decided to phone Ruth Lew and at least give her
 
the option of a final interview.  I told Ruth of my intention  to give
 
the School a copy of the PM Magazine film and to donate copies of some
 
slides I had taken of the dragon in the Battle of Flo w
ers Parade.  She
 
graciously accepted both offers.  She inquired if she might be able
 
to see a copy of the final report I was writing (
I promised her she
 
could.)  She apologized for the lack of support I had encountered.
 
She did not volunteer for a personal interview.  I did not compromise
 
her position by asking her for one.
 
My only means, then, of guessing at the current status of the
 
curriculum at the school is from viewing the PM Magazine film and
 
SA Chinese -
 32
 
from interpreting notes gleaned fran my first interview with Lily
 
Bailey, with amplification by Lily in the  John Leung and Sam Ng inter-
views.
 
The PM Magazine film makes no mention  of language classes.  A few
 
Chinese characters are being drawn on the blackboard by Ruth Lew; and
 
a man identified as Ben Jin is showing a student a book.  But the
 
impression given to and by the television crew is that the school has
 
placed its emphasis on cultural activities other than language.  The
 
emphasis seems to be particularly upon dances.
 
In the initial interview I had with Lily Bailey, she explained that
 
the school at present had no principal.  It is run by three directors.
 
It has three teachers.  She named only two of them.  Ben Jin, who
 
speaks no English, has retired from the restaurant business.  He
 
teaches Toi San.  Mrs. Hoh teaches Mandarin to seven or eight students.
 
The school has 55 students enrolled, only seventeen or eighteen of whom
 
attend the regular weekend classes.
 
In the interview with John Leung, Lily told John that the school
 
had no principal and net only on Sundays.  She reminded John that
 
the Council itself had no President in 1980 and 1981; David Lew had been
 
elected just this year.  She stated, again, that Ben Jin was teaching
 
Toi San, and Mrs. Hoh Mandarin.  But she added that Ben Jin was teaching
 
Cantonese to three students.
 
However in the Sam Ng interview she stated that the three teachers
 
were "Dr. Lee's wife, Ruth Lew, and Mrs. Hoh"--and that the seventeen
 
SA Chinese -
 33
 
children who attended regularly were either children or grandchildren
 
of these three teachers.
 
Thrcc people were presented as teachers in the PM Magazine film;
 
Ruth Lew, Ben Jin, and Jimmie Eng.
 
Apparently, then, since 1980 the enrollment of the school has
 
dropped from about 200 to about 50.  And apparently, also, confusion
 
on the Council itself and confusion in the school have occurred during
 
the same two-to-three year period.  Whether Lily Bailey's resignation
 
has been a cause or an effect of this decreased support of the school
 
is not clear.  John Leung summed up the situaiton this way:
 "Even now,
 
with Ms. Bailey not at the school, the stndents have dropped so r
r
nich
 
because they don't have the teacher up there, you know."
 
Clearly the vitality of the San Saba school is missing in the
 
present Rhapsody school.
 
In trying to explain the decline in support of the present school,
 
John and Lily agreed that the biggest difference between the 30's and
 
the 80's was the dearth of activities for children then compared to
 
the proliferation of activities now.  Lily even went into an extensive
 
explanation of why she will not even let her two boys, both of whom
 
are over six feet tall, go out for high school athletics.  Such non-
essential activities interfere with the boys' real purpose in school:
 
study.
 
Rose Wu made the most complete attempt to articulate the difference
 
in support between the two schools:  the basic unity of the Chinese
 
community has disappeared with the influx of "outsiders"--people today
 
are "disacquainted."  Teachers are too expensive.  TV, Radio, and
 
school clubs interfere.  "You can't repeat the 1930 1s
, 1
1 she said.
 
5
.  Future. My own grasp of the potential of the school is lost in
 
the fog that hides the true make-up of the 3
,000 or so Chinese living
 
in San Antonio.  When I asked them what they thought the potential of
 
the school was, Lily said a good teacher would bring enrollment back
 
up to 200; Sam Ng said rather quietly that he didn't know; John Leung
 
just shrugged; Rose Wu said that as long as two students were enrolled
 
they'd keep the school--"for tax purposes."  Houchi Dung said there
 
was too much in-fighting, too much politics for the health of the
 
school.  He would, he said, encourage people to go if they wanted to
 
study Chinese.
 "But who want to go?  The problem is, children can only
 
play with Chinese."  And later, "It would be hard, under present
 
financial situation, to provide good language training in that place."
 
But, he added, something is better than nothing.
 
Ewing Chinn, my colleague at Trinity, furnishes, perhaps, the best
 
long distance perspective.  He did seek me out to give his views as a
 
former student of a similar school in San Francisco.  His comments are
 
striking because they were spontaneous, yet fit in with the prevailing
 
wisdom found among those of us who have stiit9ied the assimilation of
 
languages anto dominant cultures:  After twelve years of school, Ewing
 
made his parents stop sending him.  He felt guilty because he skipped
 
class more then he attended it.  His teachers could have made it more
 
SA Chinese -
 35
 
interesting, perhaps--they appeared to be teachng out of a sense of
 
duty, duty to the culture at large rather than to particular students.
 
Perhaps, but r
rst likely not, the renewed interest in ethnic heritage
 
might make language schools more possible now.  Still his observation
 
is that first generation people do not assimilate; second generation
 
people do; and third generation people are only passively interested
 
in their heritage--language learning is too much work.

-Rationale-for study 
In the 1Sring of 1976 I organized and conducted
 
a three-day conference, "Strategies for Inter-Ethnic Carrnunication."
 
The- o
onfereic
s s
i
b f
ted  r-a rant fran the Texas-carmittee-for—
 
the Humanities, and was held in San Antonio, Texas.  During that con-

 ntaped interviews. My initial interview was with Lily Bailey
 
at her house.  Lily requested that the interview not be taped.  She
 
hoped at that time that if her own role in the project were minimized
 
the administration of the school itself would consent to participating
 
in the study.  Because such participation did not occu
nd because
 
we were unable to schedule a taped interview at a later date, I have
 
transcribed all of Lily's c
xzitributions during the other interviews.
 
While this &ciientation procedure is certainly not as satisfactory
 
as an actual taped interview, it does isola t
e Lily's contributions for
 
easy reference.
 
During the initial interview with Lily she outlined a series of
 
interviews she had arranged for n.  I relied solely on these initial
 
contacts at the beginning of the research.  Later I interviewed other
 
persons I knew —but these interviews were solely of an i foi il nature.
 
Lily did not k
ixxi for sure at this first interview that we would be
 
unable to visit the school itself —thus she did not tell i
re of the
 
problem.
 
The second untaped interview was with Bi n Ng —one of those
 
interviews Lily arranged and participated in.  Bill wished to be
 
interviewed at his sotre--an oriental shop in the middle of the
 
Mexican Market, El Mercado, in downtown San Antonio.  Since the
 
market is extremely crowded and noisy, I made no atteipt to record
 
the interview.
 
Two other interviews were not recorded.  Both conversations were
 
spontaneous and I was forced to make notes as soon after the interview
 
as possible.  Ewing Chinn, a professor of philosophy and a colleague
 
of mine at Trinity University, heard of the study and cornered i
rE in
 
the /tcultY
/uncJe.  He then told of his experiences attending a
 
Chinese language school as a child in San Francisco.  John Leung, Jr.,
 
who has done same of the professional photography work for this project
 
told i
re in my office late one day of his experiences as a student of
 
Lily Ri1ey
 
YTelephone interviews. On the sane day she arranged our first
 
interview, Lily also arranged for i
re to visit the language school.

an I was to visit, telephone the day of the
 
appointment to cancel 14. That was the first of six different
 
telephone conversations I had with M. Lew.  I have made notes on
 
the conversations; I have yet to meet Ruth Lew.

to China.  Lily agreed that this return-to-China motivation was
 
Pervasive.  She explained —more to Sam Ng than to ma— the maanina of
 
an old Chinese proverb:
 
1

The Chinese people have a saying:  "
No matter how

the way we have in our minds.  Even when we were young.

Overall the ambivalence has never seemed to be o ther than ex---'
 
pected.  The Chinese community I
s involvement in social activities has
 
shown a healthy balance of cultures.  Rose Wu, Nary Eng, John Leung
 
and Sam Ng have all served as officers in both all-Chinese and non-

between the Chinese oontru

inity of the

that supported the San

for the Chinese catrnunity,
And neither nucleus attracts a c1e r
 
majority of the Chinese ooninunity.  At the end of the interview with
 
Pose Wu, Lily Bailey carnented on this present-day diversity:

agreenent.
 
In the
 this "

referred to as "the grocery store and people like that" group--decided
 
to organize the Chinese C

 When Lily explained to i

who we were to interview, she told i
re that all except Bill Eng had

served on the
 
/
Duncil.
 (
Houchi Dung also has not served on the
 
Council.)  This $ouncil was responsible for the sale of the San Sal
-
,
 
school and for the purchase of the Rhapsody school.  Fifteen years
 
elapsed between the sale of the former and the purchase of the latter.
 
During those fifteen years little, if any, language instruction took
 
Place.  In my attatpts to discover what did take place during those
 
fifteen years, I discovered nothing but wonderment and silence.
 
Sam Ng finally explained my inability to penetrate the darkness by
 
stating that nothing happened:  "
It's siir le, Scott.  If you don't
 
want sa
'
rething to get done, give it to a corrinittee."
 
When I first contacted Lily Railey about this study she suggested
 
I contact Houchi Dung.  Houch
.i is a nedical doctor and an associate
 
SA c
es
J
/'
 
professor of A1atorr!y at The University of Texas Medical Center in San
 
Antonio.  Born in Taiwan, Houchi went to ) dical .chool in Louisville,
 
Kentucky, in the late
 &tes
 He i
roved to San Antonio in the late
 
sixties,
-. A staunch supporter of the Caiinunist  regime in
 and
 
China, Houchi was invited to visit the mainland in 1973.  The visit
 
so depressed Houchi that his political views reversed imrediately.
 
Upon his return to the United States he began to organize and eventually ,,
.
,
 
C
 
founded a San Antonio chapter of the Taiwan Berei
ent Society.  ThiT
 
new organization bega(10 i
 i
y,attract some of the newer n
t
h
 
of the Chinese conmunity in San Antonio.
 
The differences between the two groups, the Taiwanese and the
 
'
Ibi San, are many and deep.  Houchi was insistent in avoiding any dis-
cussion of the Toi San group, dismissing them with:
 
It's really very sinpie.  People who are interested in

Houchi was the last person I planned to interview.  In response to
 
his queries about how the study had go
ne, I confessed x
r
r' frustration
 
at being unable to actually visit the school.  His reaction was that
 
all have "offici a
 1 "
 Chinese names, best
jowed upon them by their grand-
-!"—
 
parents.  Joanna went to sane length in discussing the four names,
 
djei
.r meanings in English, and their s
ignificance to the entire family.
 
She is obviously proud of the names.  (
An obvious coun ter point to this 
anecdote is the similarly lengthy discussion in r
ry interview with
 
SA Chinese -
 13
 
John Leung, in which he and Dora recall  fondly  1
XM John and all his
 
siblings were given English and Christian narres by the minister's wife
 
at the Chinese Baptist Church.)
 
Whatever the present carplexities of the Chinese community in
 
San Antonio, those I have interviewed do se e
n ple
ed with their lives
 
in the city.  John Leung stated toward the end of his interviai:
 
There is no China t
own
there is no central part where
 
they live.  Everybody's spread out.  But then the only
 
gathering they & is going to the club neetings, and
 
council rr
ectings, and things like that.  And the func-
tions that they have.
 
And Dora added:  "or weddings, or babies' one
..rronth-old parties."

For the record, then (s e

ch
ildhood in Arizona and her decision to move with
 
"mudhole" which
 was San Antonio in the early thirties.  John Leung
 
talks about his and Lra's wedding in San Antonio —either the first or
 
second Chinese wedding in the city.  Mary Eng discusses in great length
 
her childhood in Louisiana, her childhood visits to'
 
1China, and her
 
noney-gathering efforts through a racially prejudiced South during the
 
/
 
Japanese invasion of China.  Sam Ng talks about his family and his
 
/
 
various businesses.  Bill Eng tells about his leaving the restaurant
 
business in 1957 and about his wife's background in Hong Kong.  Houchi
 
Dung gives an extended discussion of h±s conversion from one Chinese
 
political ideology to its opposite, ta ks about his one visit to
 
Mainland China and subsequent two  
7sits to Taiwan, and candidly talks
 
about his family (
and his wife '
sjfamily) both in Taiwan and in the
 
United States.  Joanna Leung t Jcs about her siblings, about college
 
(with a delightful anecdote Concerning her genetic background —a dis-
cussion between her and a hlassnate in a biology class, where Joanna
 
thought the question referred to her acad nic background in biology),
 
and--with her fiance )oining in—di ccusses the problems of planning a

A
 
John Leung, Lily Bailey mad
n i
npDrtant observation:  "Most of the
 
meetings are at big restaurants or to the school,,
\ ,
Jr to the ,Øurch.
 
y
 
And it's all connected.  It's the only church."  The Church she referred
 
to, almost as an afterthought, was the Chinese Baptist Church.  This
 
Baptist 4 urc
 with a couple of references to other Chinese
 
Baptist c
d-x
es,; appears as a unifying thread throughout the various
 
interviews
 
Lily mentioned to i
re at one time that now that she is no longer
 
principal of the language school
 
/
'she
 been able to become more
 
active in the Chinese Baptist Church again.  She also mentioned in the
 
Sam Ng interview that she had given free Chinese conversation lessons
 
to some Am
ericans who wished to becxxre missionaries to China.
 
As mentioned above, John Leung and his siblings were all named
 
by the minister's wife at the Baptist  1urch.  Both John and Dora
 
lamented that their strong participation in the Chinese Baptist Church
 
has suffered as a consequence of their decision to convert their grc
,
 
cary store into a restaurant ten years ago.  Now that the restaurant
 
is established, they suggested (
on t
ape) that they really should get

more involved again.  They also wondered, at one point, if the Chinese

Language School really had not developed out of the plurch.
 
Ise Wu, whose husband was one of the first teachers in the San

had grown out of a

The information on the San Saba school has care fran three pri-
mary sources:  Mazy Eng and Pose Wu were both in San Antonio at or near
 
the time the school started;  John Leung and Sam Ng both attended the
 
school---John in the th±re! s and Sam in the_. e* ies; and Lily Bailey
 
-
 
had heard stories about the school during her twelve or thirteen years
 
in the city.

Both John Leung '

Th
 
Chinese businessmen who each contributed about $500 each for the pur-''
 
chase of the building on San Saba —a location that Mary Eng c

as being in the west neighborhood (

they could not.  I asked if any e- t
he-e
t
t
 f those classical
 
works had been translated into English, so their children —or even they
 
themselves-- w

C -
-  As Mary Eng implied
 
and Lily Bailey supported, racial segregation may have forced the
 
Chinese into furnishing a place for their children to gather after
 
school.
 
The racial problem is arguable and sensitive to discuss.  The
 
need to gather after school is not.  Most of the Toi San people were
 
in the grocery business, and each grocery store was 1sically a family
 
store.  As a consequence, both parents worked early morning until
 
'\
 
eight-er-so-4m-the evening.  The older children could and did, of

]t'fJ Joe Chew did begin the classes at Trinity and
 
was principal of the Chinese language school.  What really occurred in
 
those classes se ts confusing even to Lily Baile
J in my interview
 
with Sam Ng she tried to explain this way:
 
Joe had several teachers /agree to teach, like Chinn.  He
 
has a grocery store .
 .
 .
 Elaine, she pranise to teach,
 
Joe open up the sc h
oo] there was no teacher.  That's
 
how they got ma, to fill up the three classes into one.
 
Because they had Elaine Chinn, Ed M ck '
s
, and Joe
 
Chew '
s wif
arx1 sariebody else.  Five classes.  Well then,
 
when school started, enrollment and everything else, nobody
 
showed up.
 And so that's why the  ca
 
y  1

e ma.  And then
 
they mix the other three classes.  So I taught the
 
Cantonese class and his wife taught the older group.
 
During a conversation with Mary Eng, Li
ly stated that
, Mandarin
 
classes were started, by Lily, at Trinity in l97l
hat until that time
 
-

Mandarin had not been taught in any of the San Antonio schools.  In
 
the interview with John Leung/'Li
ly explained to me that they had
 
t for
 Trinity, but only during the
 r.  "
 days
 
a week and Saturdays for about two hours."
 
Both Lily
 and  John thought
 that John Leung, Jr., had attended both
 
o
 
years at Trinity.  -uf when I talked to John Jr., he said he had only
 
A
 
gone for about one nonth, one sunrn

he wanted to study calligraphy or painting (

fortunately, Joanna could remember little of the school days---
she could not even remember if all of her classes 4she
 
t  years)
e held at Rhapsody
, or if some ware held at Trinity.  She
 
did not rerr nber anything about the classes themselves.  All she knew
 
for sure was that she n
u
.ist have gone when she was in elementary school,
 
because she remembers several things fran her mi1rile school days and
 
Chinese school "is not part of those 1
L uries."  She al-
se, went because
 
she thought it would please her parents:  "They are pro-ethnic.  They
 
went to school when they were young and it was a good thing.  So f
t .
.
they
 
t

made me go."  Her main reason f o r  going, a s  m e n t i o n e d  earlier in the r e-
p o r t,  w a s  t o  spend m o r e  time with her f r i e n d s,  especially a cousin, fran

Apparently t

 Li
ly Bailey resig ed as
 
principal of the language school.  Her explar
i ticzi to i
re was that she
 
got tired of a

Dung's explanati o
n was that she was forced out.  The pressure was so
 
latter she g
'to the school when she resignea
d
 
-
 . r
'id wrote
 
intense that be had encouraged her to resign years earlier.  Sam Ng' s
 
explanation was that she got a "raw ceal
  
. "
 
All three admit that the resignation was unpleasant, harmful to the
 
enrollment at the school, and the result of petty infighting and politics
 
on the part of the Chinese CaTinunity Council.
 
Cle rly the most personally frustrating el t nt in the study of the 
Chinese language school has been my inability to study '
lhe 7 t
hool. I
t
 
Houchi Dung assures me that had I been able to work with the principles
 
involved with the school itself, I would not have learned as such about
 
either the history of  the school or the canpiexity of the present
 
Chinese carinunity;  While such assurances help to soothe my frustration,
 
they may not necessarily be true.  What is true
 that I was able to
 
talk to only two people involved directly with the present school, and
 
I was able to &)
 only by telephone.
 
Lily Bailey arranged early in the project for i
re to visit the 
language school on Sunday, April 18, 1982.  At 2
:00 p.m. on that day,,-
-"  
the students would be working on a dragon, which they would use in the
 
upcoming Battle of Flowers Par
e.  At 10:00 a
. . on the day of my
 
appoiritrr
ent ,
h Lew phoned to cancel the photography session.  In
 
fact, she seared surprised that I had intended to take photographs.  She
 
did ask that I phone back /
i gave her number.
 
The following day she phoned again (
I was not in) and left a massage
 
that she would "like to explain things."  I did not  reach her until
 
two days later.  In that conversation she explained that the school
 
itself had r
iot had a principal since Lily Bailey had resigned —that it
 
was now run by a ccamittee of three
 rsons.  She did not name any of
 
the three.  She said that the three were not qualified, but were willing
 
to "do it."  She also volunteered that later in the month, the television
 
)
 
program F
!4 Magazine would air sare film they had just taken at the
 
/School.
 (
The local ABC station later donated a copy of the footage
 
'
 
to this project.)  And2 she
uggested that I telephone David Lew,
 
president of the,
,4tmtuJnity/ouncil to get permission to attend the
 
last session of the schcol
w ±ctr
 ± be
eeting Z the following
 
Sunday.
 
I was able to reach Mr. Lew by phone later that evening.  He was
 
extrarely upset at my call.  He could not believe Ruth Lew had aske
 
C
A
 
He to callf he
as shocked when I said I wanted to talk to Ruth
 bec ause
 
'
2
 
she was a teacher at the school (
"Ruth is a teacher?  Who told you Ruth
 
was a teacher'  She's not a teacher at the school.")()be said he
 uld
 
not give i
re permission nor deny i
re permission to attend the Sunday class,
 
because he could not without the entire /cuncil's approval, and the
 
/ouncil did not meet again until June.
 
If I understood him correctly, Lily Bailey had asked the /)uncil'S
 
approval earlier and the
 
i
nc i
l had told Lily to proceed with the
 
project  but it was to be Lily's project  not the Council's.  Then he
 
want into a big tirade against all people who were in such a hurry to get
 
things done:  people wanted to make a dragon without council approval,
 
people wanted to make television film without council approval, and
 
now people fran Washington D.C. wanted to study the school without
 
p
ouncil approval.  I assured him that I
, as the local representative
 
of the people in Washington, only wanted to study the school with
 
the  ouncil's approval.  ftA
f that were impossible because of
 
scheduling d
ifficulties, we wanted to do it with his approval.  He
 
reiterated his position that I could ask the f uncil in June; that
 
he had no power to give approval himself.  I reiterated my position
 
that I had a deadline that precluded waiting until June.  David ended
 
the conversation with another tirade against people who were always
 
in a hurry:  "And that's their problem
, not mine."
 
I feel that I could have gone out to the  ch
ool the following
 
Sunday.  I also felt that '
would allow me to win a snail battle and
 
lose a bigger war —if war is what had developed.  Then I decided that
 
if I want, war would develop.  So I opted not to go.
 
one month later I decided to phone Ruth Lew and at least give her
 
the option of a final interview.  I told Ruth of my intention  to give
 
the School a copy of the PM Magazine  
film and to donate copies of sate
 
slides I had taken of the dragon in the Battle of Flowers Parade.  She
 
graciously accepted both offers.  She inquired if she might be able
 
to see a copy of the final report I was writing (C pranised her she
 
could.)
 apologized for the lack of support   had encountered.
 
She did not '
volunteer for a personal interview
 I did not compromise
 
her position by asking her for one.
 
My only means, then, of guessing at the current status of the
 
curriculum at the school is frczu viewing the PM Magazine film and

 that the seventeen

Apparently, then, since 1980 the enrollment of the school has
 
dropped fran about 200 to about 50.
 als i confusion
 
I

 A
 
on the k unci

/
 A
 
the sane two-to-1three year period.  Whether Lily Bailey' s
 
  resignation
 
\
 
has been a cause or an effect o
 edecreased-support of the shool '
 
is not clear.  John Leung summed up the situaiton this way:  "Even now,
 
with Ms. Bailey not at the school, the students have dropped so much
 
because they don '
t have the teacher up there, you know."
 
Clearly the vitality of the San Saba school is missing in the
 
present Rhapsody school.

In trying to explain the decline in support
 e
-j the present school,
 
John and Lily agreed that the biggest difference between the

the 8Q.
! di s the dearth of activities for children then compared to
 
the proliferation of activities now.  Lily even went into an extensive
 
explanation of why she will not even let her two boys, both of whom
 
are over six feet tall, go out for high school athletics.  Such non-
essential activities interfere with the boys' real purpose in school:
 
study.

just shrugged; Rose Wu said that as long as two students were enrolled
 
they'd keep the school--"for tax purposes."  Houchi Dung said there
 
was too much in-fighting, too much politics for the health of the
 
school.  He would, he s
aid, encourage people to go if they wanted to
 
study Chinese.  "But who want to go?  The problem is ,

 later, "It would be hard, und r present
 
financial situation, to provide good language training in that place,."
