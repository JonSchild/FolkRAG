[Brandy Nālani McDougall reads “This Island on which I Love You”] 
 
Brandy Nālani McDougall:  Aloha mai e nā kūpuna, nā aloha ʻāina, nā mamo, nā hoa. Aloha mai 
kākou. ʻO Brandy Nālani McDougall kēia. ʻO Kula ma ka mauna o Haleakalā ma Maui a Kama 
kuʻu kulāiwi aloha, a noho au ma ʻAiea ma Oʻahu a Lua. Aloha everyone. My name is Brandy 
Nālani McDougall and I was raised on the slopes of Haleakalā in the town of Kula on the island 
of Maui. I live now in ʻAiea on Oʻahu. 
 
I wrote the poem, “This Island on which I Love You,” as a love poem to show the refuge of love 
and family amidst the ongoing trauma of U.S. militarization and settler colonialism in Hawaiʻi 
and the experience of having to bear witness to the violent devastation of our lands and 
waters. The island in the poem is of course Oʻahu, the most populated island in our paeʻāina, 
our archipelago, and also the most militarized, with over twenty-five percent of the island 
occupied by military bases, firing ranges, housing and other installations. Even in areas not 
occupied by the military, however, you may still be subjected to loud aircraft drills, unexploded 
ordinances, and toxic contaminants in our soil and waterways. Aside from militarization, 
overdevelopment from tourism and luxury properties for the very wealthy which sit vacant 
most of the year, have created severe infrastructural problems in Waikīkī and other parts of 
O’ahu. When we have a heavy rain or a storm on Oʻahu, there is simply not enough green land 
to hold the water in places that are overdeveloped places like Waikīkī mean that the rain 
washes trash, pesticides and other chemicals down toward the ocean creating brownwater that 
is unsafe for swimming as well as brownwater that is toxic for marine, plant, and animal life.  
 
In this way, I chose in this poem to make everyday intimate experiences of our ʻohana visible to 
show that we are vulnerable alongside the ways that we must live with another member of our 
ʻohana, our island, being subjected to horrible violence. At the same time, I hope that the poem 
also shows our persistence as a people to continue to love and hope, to continue to protect our 
āina, and following our island’s lead in acknowledging its strength and healing.
