Simpkins' Party. 
Words and Music by JAMES RUSSELL, .
and sung by THE RUSSELLS with 
great success in their original " White and Black Changes." 
Miss Simpkins gave a 
party you must know, 
And of course we were invited for to go. 
There were many people there that would make you almost 
stare, 
To see them dance upon their heel and toe. 
The fiddle and the banjo soon did play, 
Which made us feel so happy and so gay. 
There was lots of singing, too, which now in our heads runs 
through; 
We'll try our best and sing them o'er to you. 
SPOKEN. 
1ST SWELL—Well, Augustus; how did you enjoy yourself 
at the party last evening ? 
2D SWELL— I enjoyed myself very much. 
But did you 
take notice of that deaf and dumb man that came in ? 
1ST SWELL—Yes, I 
took notice he didn't have much to 
say. 
2D SWELL—Yes, but I 
took notice he heard me when I 
asked him to drink. 
1ST SWELL— He wasn't deaf to that. 
2D SWELL—Well, he would have been if he had to pay 
for it. 
HT SWELL—Well, ieaving all joking aside, there were only 
two songs sung that I 
cared anything about, and they were 
the Irish song and the ballad. 
Now, if you will sing the 
ballad I'll try and sing the Irish song. 
NI 
2D SWELL—Yes, I'll sing the ballad ; but you can't sing 
Irish. 
1ST SWELL—Why can't I 
sing Irish ? 
2D SWELL—Because you haven't been long enough in 
Cork! 
[Exit. 
1ST SWELL— I'll give you an imitation of an Irish lady 
singing a 
song at a 
party, and with all due respect to her sex 
she sang a 
song (cue for music) which went something like 
this: 
Sings. 
"BOLD JACK DONAHUE ." 
Come all you true born Irishmen, wherever you may be, 
Attention pay to what I 
say, and value it if you do, 
While I 
relate the matchless fate 
Of bold Jack Donahue. 
CHORUS. 
Ha, ha hailye come ha, lay me down lindsayback muchah-
mulgay, 
Lay me down lindsayback muchamulholligan, 
Skillkenny ho, ho; fly away leatherhead bullybackboo. 
He left old Ireland for to go and plow the raging sea; 
He went away so very gay, with heart as light and true, 
The ship was tossed and all were lost 
With bold Jack Donahue. 
Ha ha hailye, &c. 
!ST SWELL—That's what the Irishwoman sang, and while 
I 
was there a 
colored gentleman came in, and he was asked 
to sing a 
song; so he obliged them by singing a 
ballad, en-
Ltitled 
"LAY MY HEAD BENEATH A ROSE." 
Composed expressly for, and sung by, JouN RUSSELL, of THE Russaus, 
by N ED STRAIGHT. 
Darling, fold me to you closer, 
As you did in days of yore ; 
Press your lips upon my forehead, 
Ere I 
see the golden shore. 
Life is from me fastly fleeting, 
Soon I'll be in sweet repose; 
When I'm gone I 
ask this favor, 
Lay my head beneath a 
rose. 
CHORUS. 
Lay me where sweet flowers blossom— 
Where the dainty lily grows; 
Where the pink and violets mingle, 
Lay my head beneath a 
rose. 
Darling one, when first I 
met you, 
When I 
pledged you hand and heart, 
There were roses on your cheeks, love, 
And we vowed we ne'er would part. 
One more kiss, for I 
am going 
Far beyond all earthly woes ; 
Let my grave be like your cheeks, love, 
Covered with the blushing rose. 
Lay me where sweet flowers, &c. 
When the Flowers Fall Asleep. 
Composed by ROLLIN H OWARD, and sung with great success by Joiirt 
RUSSELL, of THE RUSSELLS. 
Where the water lilies grow, 
And the zephyrs gently blow, 
Where the waters softly flow, 
Meet me, darling Annie ! 
When the whippoorwill cloth call, 
And the dew drops softly fall, 
While the moon shines over all, 
Kiss me, darling Annie 
CHORUS. 
When the flowers fall asleep, 
And the moon shines o'er the deep, 
Tell me I 
your heart may keep, 
Then, my darling Annie! 
Harken to the turtle dove, 
Cooing from its nest above, 
List'ning to the tale of love, 
Whisper'd unto Annie! 
How he envies me the bliss, 
Pressing such a 
form as this, 
How he wishes he might kiss 
Your sweet lips, my Annie ! 
When the flowers, &c. 
While the little stars do shine, 
Place your snowy hand in mine, 
Whisper softly, " I'll be thine," 
Now, my darling Annie! 
From the clouds the moonbeams break, 
Show'ring silver o'er the lake, 
Lisening to the vows I 
take, 
From you, darling Annie! 
When the flowers, & C. 
South Carolina Wenches. 
Written and sung by THE RUSSELLS with great success. 
You see before you now two peculiar sort of nigs, 
Aunt Hannah and Aunt Chloe, 
For dancing in the ballet or shuffling in the jigs, 
There's where it is our glory. 
But when we lived in Florida how happy we were then; 
We had a 
good old massa and he was the best of men. 
CHORUS. 
Old aunt Hannah and aunt Chloe 
Is happy as can be; 
Old aunt Hannah and aunt Chloe 
Were born way down in Florida. 
(Dance.) 
Them good old days are gone, and they'll never come 
no more 
To the children of this nation, 
When we would sing and dance on the old kitchen floor, 
And raise a 
big sensation; 
you could hear us darkies laughing almost a 
mile around, 
When all was still and silent on the old plantation 
ground. 
Chorus and Dance. 
The Two Servant Girls. 
Written by T. 
REAGAN, of McCoNNIN & REAGAN, for THE RUSSELLS. 
We're two neat servant girls, Mary Flynn and Kate Burke, 
Not far from this spot in a 
hc,tel we work ; 
It's full of play-actors and all such like boys, 
And from morning till night there's the devil's own noise. 
CHORUS. 
With dancing and singing from morning till night, 
And to imitate each one it is our delight ; 
Kind friends, pay attention, we've not long to stay, 
And the doings of play-actors we will now give away. 
There's two song and dance men, sure, in Room No. 9, 
With their feet they keep belting the floor all the time ; 
Their legs look like pipe-stems, with tight skinny pants, 
So we'll now imitate them while we have the chance. 
With dancing, &c. 
Now we don't want to tarry 
we are willing to marry ; 
Young men, won't you have us ?—now here's a 
good chance; 
We are young and good-looking, and can do all your cook-
ing, 
And all kinds of jigs we will learn you to dance. 
With dancing &c. 
Dandy Colored Swells. 
AN ORIGINAL CLOG ACT. 
,Written by JAMES RUSSELL, of THE RUSSELLS, and performed by them 
with great success. 
Here we are, two dandy colored swell, ' 
Always happy and so gay; 
We're in love with all the charming little belles 
That we chance to meet upon our way. 
CHORUS, 
When the little birds are singing, 
Pretty Sally, do not tarry ; 
We are waiting, charming Carrie, 
For to meet you, darling loved ones here tu-night. 
(Dance.) 
Last evening, as the sun had just set, 
And the little stars were twinkling from above 
It was then we met our darling little pet, 
And of course we at once fell in love. 
Chorus and dance. 
We asked them for to name the wedding day, 
And they blushed and answered with a 
sniile; 
.Next Sunday, they said, in such a 
pleasant way, 
That we couldn't help smiling all the while. 
CHORUS. 
When the marriage bells are ringing, 
Pretty Sally, charming Carrie ; 
And the darkies they'll be singing, 
For to celebrate our happy wedding day. 
(Dance.) 
Two Italians. 
Written by HUGH FAY, and sung with success by THr_ Russaus. 
We are two Italians, you see—that's all right, 
We work in the gas house one day and one night; 
Them Irishmen wanted us for to f1 ,11 t. 
SO 
of course we had to swim 
CHORUS. 
We handle our pick and our shovel, 
And we mind our own business, you see; 
That pays better than picking them chestnuts, 
For two Italians are we—that's so. 
Now we are going to work of the Park 
From seven of the morning until it is dark; 
We feel just as happy like a 
little lark, 
For two Italians are we—that's so. 
We handle our pick, &c. 
As soon as our day's work is over 
We take our hand-organ and seek 
Through the streets of this city all over, 
And earn a 
few dollars a 
week—that's so. 
We handle our pick, &c. 
Gay Fifth Avenue. 
Words by M. H. Losscx, and sung with immense success by the great 
Gus M ILLS. 
TO MY FRIENDS, THE RUSSELLS. 
We fashionable belles of Union you know I'm one, 
Are gazed at by the swells, and it is such fun. 
As through the Park we drive, 
Dressed in fashions gay in style, 
By all the swells we're eyed 
Along the gay Fifth avenue. 
CHORUS. 
For we dash along in first-rate style, 
We ladies of the ladies' mild ; 
'Tis that by whiskered swells the while 
We fashionable belles. 
The man that marries me must have no lack of cash, 
For I 
shall always be inclined to cut a 
slash. 
My carriage I 
must have, 
And horses to the while. 
And they must run, not creep, 
Along .eifth avenue. 
For we dash along in first-rate style, 8ce.

Jacob Snider. 
Dutch Song and Dance. Written and sung by JoHN RUSSELL. 
My name is Jacob Snider, 
I 
keep a 
bier saloon; 
Sell lager bier and cider, 
And have free lunch at noon. 
But bums they do come in there 
And buy one glass of bier, 
You ought to see them tackle that lunch, 
And see it disappear. 
CHORUS. 
They eat up all my crackers, (Symph.) 
And beg all my tobacco. 
You ought to see them eat, oh my! 
But now I 
think I'll fix them—I've got a 
kidney stew, 
It's made of second-handed pants, some tooth brushes and 
glue. 
(Dance.) 
Now there's a 
little rooster— 
On his back he has a 
hunch— 
I 
know he will come to-morrow 
And eat up all my lunch. 
But when that glue gets cold in him, 
Won't there be lots of fun i 
It will glue his stomach up so tight 
And kill that son of a 
gun. 
Chorus and Dance.

The Irish Widows. 
THE RUSSELLS' greatest success, performed only by them in all the prin. 
cipal theatres throughout the United States. 
Good evening, kind friends, one and all, 
We came for to sing you a 
song, 
We'll try our best for to please you, 
And we promise we'll not keep you long. 
We came a 
great way across the ocean, 
Your kind faces all for to see, 
To tell you of all our misfortune, 
For two lonely widows are we. 
CHORUS. 
Fl o—h 
o— 
All alone! 
For two lonely widows are we. 
(Music.)

511 
(Dance.) 
If any of you want for to marry, 
And settle completely for life, 
Now it's Michael or Dennis or Larry— 
Come step up and pick out your wife. 
We'll cook and we'll do all the scrubbing, 
Boil your eggs and your coffee and tea, 
We'll be easy and quiet and loving. 
For two lonely widows are we.

Darling one, when first I 
met you, 
When I 
pled.2:ed you hand and heart; 
There were roses on your cheeks. love, 
And we VOW'd we Ile'er would part: 
One more kiss, for I 
am going, 
Far beyond all earthly woes; 
Let my grave be like your cheeks, love, 
Covered with the blushing rose.-- Cho.

A DANDY and a 
lady's man 1ia come before you now, 
A man of taste and culture, for ' tis written on my brow ; 
In Irish circles I'm the pet of -all the ladies fair, 
And I 
always meet with favor and a 
hearty welcome there. 
The reason must be obvious, I 
don't make use of slang; 
I 
use well chosen language, which surprises all the gang. 
You'll often hear the ladies say, " Now hasn't he the tone ? 
He ought to be a 
counsellor, George Constantine McKeown." 
I'm in the book and picture trade, I 
canvas every day; 
And tho' the times are very hard, I 
always make it pay. 
The literature of Ireland I 
have at my command, 
And when I'm talking up a 
trade my style is great and grand; 
I 
tell them how brave Sarsfield fought and kcpt the foe at bay, 
And how the women held the fort at Limerick town that day ; 
I 
get them all excited, for I 
am no dunce or drone; 
You'll hear them cry, " I'll take four books, George Constantine 
• McKeown." 
You ought to hear me make a 
speech about election time; 
I 
overflow with eloquence, with anecdote, with rhyme; 
My attitudes are picturesque, and I 
can plainly show 
That I'm the Irish orator, the Celtic " Cicero." 
Some try to imitate me, but their show attempts are vile; 
They cannot catch my lofty tone, my grand imperious style. 
Let spurious imitators fall, for equals I 
have none; 
I 
am the great original, George Constantine McKeown. 
Sung by W ILLIAM SCANLAN with great success. 
Air—" Mulcahey's Gone Away." 
Come listen to me one an' all, 
To what I'm goin' to say, 
It's all about a 
neighbor o' mine, 
Who lives across the way; 
He's the owner of a 
big coal cart, 
An' he likewise drives the same, 
An' he got a 
great big billy goat, 
Who's very much to blame. 
CHORUS. 
For whin he'd jump, he'd hit you a 
thump, 
Unless you'd quickly slope; 
Oh, the terror of the neighborhood— 
Is Gilfillen's big buck goatl 
I'll tell you of the damages, 
That he's done all around, 
He wint into Mrs. Higgins' house, 
And her Sunday gaiters found; 
He began to ate, when she gave a 
bawl, 
Oh, I 
tell you there was a 
row, 
He sint her rollin' over the stove— 
She needs no bustle now. 
For whin he'd jump, eta. 
Now it was here this afthernoon, 
He came into my yard, 
While I 
was plantin' flowers, 
And he sthruck me ruc:hty hard;

She'll sing and she'll dance to the old mill clack, 
And the song that she sings " Will my love come back," 
Till her old grandpa with his long white hair, 
Laughs aloud till the tears down his cheeks run clear; 
And the lads in the village they know right well, 
What a 
charmer exists in that rustic dell. 
I

Or a

I 
sighed. " Pretty Polly, what a

And she said, get along, or I'll tell Grandpa." 
She's just like an angel that sweetly sings,

Still she would not calmly listen 
To the loving words I

But blushed and murmured, "stop that, mister,"

did meet her, 
In a

And I

Ere she'd time to tell me not, 
And I 
quickly did discover 
That she was not now afraid, 
When I 
acted as a 
lover 
Soon great progress then I 
made. 
Married life she said she'd like it, 
And she'd gladly marry me: 
So a 
bargain we did strik 
it, 
And my wife she'll shortly be, 
And when arrives the happy day 
When I 
squeze her she won't say— 
Chao. — Georgie, Georgie, do give over, 
Georgie now you frighten me; 
We'll spend our future days at Doter, 
But I

THE DAYS OF '49. 
Sung with great success by Wnzvat COURTRIGHT. 
YOU'RE looking now on old Tom Moore, a 
relic of former days, 
A 
bummer, too, they call me now, but what care I 
for praise; 
For my heart is filled with the days of old, and oft' do I 
repine 
For those days of old, those days of gold, those days of '49. 
I 
had comrades, too, a 
saucy crew, hard cases I 
must confess; 
But still they were brave and true, my boys, as hunters from 
the West; 
They'd stand the pinch, and never flinch, and never fret nor 
whine, 
But like good old bricks, they stood the kicks, in the days of '49. 
There's Monte Pete, I'll ne'er forget, for the luck that he 
always had; 
He'd deal for you both night and day, or as long as you had a 
scad. 
One night a 
pistol laid him low, ' twas his last lay out in fine, 
For it caught Pete sure, dead in the door, in the days of '49. 
There was Poker Bill, he was one of the boys, he was always 
in for a 
game, 
And whether he lost, or whether he won, it was always to 
him the same. 
28 
He would ante a 
slug, or rush the buck, or go a 
hat-full blind; 
But in a 
game with death, poor Bill lost his breath, in the days 
of '49. 
Thei e 
was Buffalo Bill, he could outroar a 
buffalo bull, you bet; 
He'd roar all night, and he'd roar all day, and I 
guess Bill's 
roaring yet. 
One night he fell in a 
prospect hole, t'w as a 
roarin' bad design, 
For in that hole Bill rolled out his soul, in the days of '49. 
There was Galous Jake, a 
butcher boy, so fond of getting tight, 
And whenever he got on a 
spree he was spilin' for a 
fight. 
One night he ran against a 
knife in the hands of old Bob Cline, 
So over Jake we held a 
wake, in the days of ' 49. 
There was old lame Jesse, a 
hard old cuss, and he never 
would repent, 
He never missed a 
single meal, and he never put up a 
cent. 
But poor old Jesse, like all the rest, did at last to death resign, 
And in his bloom he went up the flume, in the days of '49. 
Of all the comrades I 
had then, not one remains to boast, 
I'm left alone in my misery, like some poor wandering ghost; 
The boys they all say I'm a 
fraud, and call me a 
travging sign, 
Saying, there's Tom Moore, a 
bummer sure, of the days of 49.

A 
Contradiction. 
" 
The mill will never grind again 
With the water that has past." 
A 
maxim of the olden time 
That will forever last. 
This theme, in verses written, 
Preaches a 
sermon to all ; 
But critically weighed with wisdom, 
How does the lesson fall ? 
The mIll upon a 
slope doth stand, 
It bears an antique shape; 
Waters from the mountain-land 
Seem happy to escape, 
And, rushing by the old mill's wheel, 
Causing it to grind, 
Bound madly on the vale beyond, 
A 
level there to find. 
The race now o'er, with calmness 
Into a 
lake the water flows, 
And, mingling with the tranquil flood, 
Seeks peace in sweet repose. 
The bright sunbeams then visiting 
This realm to Somnus given, 
The tiny globes in vapors rise 
To space above in heaven. 
Once in air, they congregate, 
Fantastic clouds to be, 
And, wafted by the summer breeze, 
Float off most gracefully. 
Soon the mountain tops are reached, 
Ere they cling for rest; 
Each rugged peak is hid from view, 
Each in vapor dressed. 
At morn the clouds would fain ascend, 
And leave this dreary plain; 
But, chilled through by the frigid air, 
Condensed, they fall in rain. 
As the pearly drops alight, 
They dance about with glee, 
For are they not of earth again, 
Just as they used to be ? 
They prance, they skip, and race along, 
O'er pebbled brook and rill— 
When lo! they reach familiar ground, 
And pass the same old mill. 
In doing so they turn the wheel, 
With sparkling spray o'ercast, 
Thus proving that the mill does grind 
With water that has past. 
Philosophically the lesson's taught, 
Bidding us beware, 
Although a 
chance unheeded pass, 
Not to incite despair. 
Labor on with redoubled zeal, 
Lost hours to redeem, 
And teach your conscience thus to feel, 
That things are what they seem. 
Opportunities appearing lost, 
And numbered with the slain, 
By providential agencies 
Will surely come again. 
Now bear in mind, although the Fates 
Your hopes continually blast, 
Kind Nature's mill will grind again 
With watet that has past.

There's a 
Sweet Pace at the Window. 
BY 
IIARRY BURNS. 
There's a 
sweet face at the Window, 
And it's looking o'er at me, 
Till its glances soft and loving 
Fills my soul with ecstacy, 
And its pretty eyes are blending 
Like the moon-lit sky when blue 
With its radiance transcending 
Like the rainbow's lovely hue. 
CHORUS. 
There's a 
sv‘eet face at the window, 
See it glancing through the pane. 
And my heart is sadly waiting 
Till I 
see it once again. 
There is music softly flowing 
From those sweet lips thro' the air 
And my heart with love is glowing 
For that sweet face over there, 
And its melody is sounding, 
Till I 
feel its joyous thrill, 
And my spirit quickly bounding 
To its music sweet and still. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
Yes, your eyes of dark blue flashing, 
Sends me feeling so divine, 
You who are so handsome, dashing, 
That I 
love to call you mine; 
And your sweet face at the window, 
How it haunts me in my dreams! 
Then how sad when I 
awaken 
Finding life not what it seems. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc. 
'Tis your sweet face at the window 
That is ever in my view, 
And it fills me o'er with gladness, 
For my thoughts are all for you; 
Yes, my thoughts are always flying 
To the one I 
love so dear, 
And my heart is sadly sighing 
For that sweet face over there. 
There's a 
sweet face, etc.

Why sh uld we for e'er be pining, 
While there's sun-shine in the heart,.

Bright clouds, sunny days, 
Happy moments pass away,

Evening's twilight gently glitter,

O'er the stile where lovers listen, 
Why should we be ever weary„ 
While there's sun-shine in the heart. 
Fancy with her magic finger, 
O'er our brows will fondly linger, 
And our heart, the sweetest singer, 
Tells us that we ne'er shall part.

And our sorrows we'll be hiding,

THERE'S ONLY ONE. 
By HARRY BURNS. 
IN 
all this wide world with its dazzle and glow 
There's only one heart that I 
love here below; 
There's only one spirit looks kindly i 
n 
mine 
And tells me its motions are true and devine; 
Only one pair of sweet, dark loving eyes, 
That lifts my poor soul from this filth to the skies. 
There's only one name that I 
love for to say; 
There's only one thought in my heart day by day; 
There's only one sweet loving face that I 
see, 
And it haunts me with pleasure wherever I 
be; 
Whenever it's absent it fills me with pain, 
Oh 
then how I 
long for its presence again. 
But tell me, sweet heart, will you always be true 
And cherish sweet thoughts for the one who loves you? 
Or will you, like others, be cruel and cold, 
And forget those fond words you so often have told; 
Fond words that my heart breathes with joyous delight. 
And fills me with bliss even morn. noon and night. 
Sweet darling, 
pray, take my poor heart in store, 
And tell me your love wilt be true evermore; 
But why should I 
ask when your eyes silent speak 
And tell me so plainly the wish that I 
seek; 
In all this wide world. wherever you be, 
You're the same happy, darling sweet creature to me.

A 
BIT OF MY MIND. 
I'M not of a 
quarrelsome nature at alk 
But a 
peaceable sort of a 
man, 
And I 
always avoid a 
dispute or a 
brawl., 
That's to say, if I 
possibly can: 
Still if people behave in an insolent way, 
Or to argue or fight are inclin'd, 
Why I 
first listen calmly to all they've to say, 
Then I 
pive them a 
bit of my mind.. 
CHORIIR. 
A. bit of my mind, a 
bit of my mind, 
If friends or relations should e'er prove unkind, 
You cannot conceive the relief that I 
find, 
If I'm able to give them a 
piece of my inind. 
When a 
wild little urchin of seven years old, 
I 
was under a 
pedagogue's rule, 
And the first time I 
got into trouble, I'm told, 
Was for smashing a 
window at school; 
I was promised the cane. aa a 
11\ aka o% mask 
Which I 
told them was not very kind, 
But I 
didn't much care tho' they flogg'd me by force, 
For I 
gave them a 
bit of mind. 
A 
bit of my mind, tke.„ 
I've been sadly deceiv'd by my inthnate friend, 
Tho' I 
treated him just like a 
prince, 
For he took all the cash I 
could manage to lend, 
And I've never set eyes on him since; 
Still I 
wrote him a 
letter, indignant and strong, 
Full of all the bad names I 
could find, 
And it pleas'd me to think, tho' his conduct was wrong, 
That I 
gave him a 
bit of my mind. 
A 
bit of my mind, (Lc. 
So if ever I'm injur'd or treated amiss, 
My behavior is always the same, 
And I've one satisfaction at least which is this, 
That I 
don't think I'm greatly to blame. 
If my wife should elope with a 
rival to-day, 
(Tho' I 
might not at first be resign'd,) 
I 
should feel myself better. I'm happy to say, 
U I 
gave them a 
bit of my mind.

THE COLORED SWELL, 
Written expressly for FRANK BENNETT, by W. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
You may talk of your la de da fellows, 
Your Hilder Montrose and that kind, 
But in me see the prince of all swell-os, 
None grander than me can you find. 
I'm deucedly fond of the ladies. 
And the ladies are all fond of me; 
Like a 
bee in a 
garden of daisies, 
I 
flatter myself I'm that bee. 
CHoitus 
I'm swell of the belles, you bet. 
The pride of the girls, their pet; 
Oh, dear, how they smile at my exquisite style, 
I'm the swell of all swells, you bet. 
Now, a 
rich uncle lately departed, 
lie's gone to that home, bright and fair, 
But he made out his will and started, 
And I 
was his only heir. 
So the few thousand pounds that he left me, 
I'm rapidly turning to cash, 
Now, I'm doing the thing rather hefty, 
Yes, doing the grand with a 
dash. 
I'm swell, ttc. 
Now, my rule is to honor propriety, 
Smoke " Vanity Fair" cigarettess, 
Drink wine in the best of society, 
Be loved and caressed by the pets. 
The darlings. they all dote upon me, 
Say that I'm too sweet to live, 
They hoax, and they coax and they chaff me, 
And they'll kill me with love, I 
helieve.

I've an aged mother, and a

They earn jointly enough to

They live in a

fashionable street, and eat my meals when I

After allowing them a

It's copied by my rivals, 
Who haunt me all the while. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, it's very annoying to have a

idiots dogging you about, trying to find out your tailor, to make 
your acquaintance, etc.

THE COT IN THE CORNER. 
OCH hone, wirrastew, how hard is our lot, 
The landlord has turned us out of our cot, 
To us in this world 'twas the happiest spot, 
On the hill-side beyant in the corner; 
The roof was thatched over with bright yellow straw, 
And the walls were as white as the snowflake agra, 
Oh it was a 
fine picture a 
painter might draw, 
From the boreen beyant in the corner. 
It was purty without, it was tidy within, 
On the shelves, shone like silver, our plate made of tia, 
Which cast some reflections when sunlight stole in, 
On the dog and the cat in the corner; 
Of bacon, galore, we had many a 
flitch in, 
The wide-mouthed chimney, that yawned in the kitcnen, 
Oh ' twould make your mouth water, and eager to pitcn 
To the hames that hung high in the corner. 
And there by the fire my mother would knit, 
And close to her side my ould father would sit, 
What stories he'd tell when his dudeen was lit, 
While he smoked away in the corner; 
When supper was over the neighbors dropped in, 
Aud by the turf fire each roasted his shin, 
While the boys and the girls ne'er thought it a 
sin 
For to hug and to kiss in the corner. 
When Jimmy, the piper, walked In on the floor, 
The young people all made a 
rush for the door 
Dragging Jimmy along to the barn and sure 
They placed him high up in the corner; 
Then at it they went, dear, with hearts light and gay, 
And danced the night hours into the young day, 
'Till Jimmy got drunk an' no longer could play, 
Fr be lay pipes and all in the comer. 
THE COONS FROM ALABAMA. 
Written by S. S. Pettit and sung with great success by Pettit/ 
White. 
We are two coons raised from the ground, 
As good and sound as can be found. 
We are always sure to be around, 
The sights all for to see, 
We're from the sunny southern south, 
You see we're full of life, 
What one can't do the other can, 
between us there's no strife. 
CHORUR. 
We are gay and festive as you can plainly see, 
Always full of fun so happy light and free, 
"We'll do the best we can no matter where we be, 
We're the coons from Alabama. 
(Repeat.) 
We have to work out all the day, 
The people say we are too gay, 
But when from work we get away, 
You bet we can't keep still, 
So after working the whole long day, 
They keep us on till dark, 
That's the time we have our fun, 
For we go out on a 
lark.

THE FUNNIEST MAN IN THE RING, 
Subject to Illustration, 
By COL. CLAUDE DEH •VEN. 
THE throng have assembled, the canvas is full, 
The brass band has played twice or more. 
The crowd are impatient the show to begin, 
As the ring master comes out from the door 
And enters the circle, ( as they only know how.) 
And announces the rider in turn, 
Likewise the jester who makes a 
low bow, 
And the rider starts off on his run. 
Swift as thought 'round the ring flies the stallion of gray, 
The jolly old clown close behind, 
The ring-master's whip continualy cracks, 
Making one dizzy, and seemingly blind. 
The music stops short, the horse ends his run, 
The feats great applause quickly bring, 
But wait for the clown to ' get in his work," 
And then a 
good song he will sing. 
The funniest of jokes he rattles off fast, 
As though he ne'er told them before, 
His grammar is good, elocution the same, 
Now hark, how the audience roar; 
Miss Flora Malimsey drops her bit: Grecian bend, 
Josh Talbott's suspender has broke, 
Off by himself sits the old village squire, 
Who laughs like a " solid old bloak." 
The vast canvas resounds with shouts and applause, 
At jokes and bon mots of the clown, 
A 
lively commotion is quickly kicked up, 
At the funniest man in the town; 
Then comes the song, the best of the act, 
For the word's and the tune's just the thing, 
All are attention to " pick up the snap," 
Of the funniest man in the ring. 
This is the rare old ring jester whom many have seen, 
A 
man of great wit and renown, 
Who makes people laugh wherever he goes, 
lie's the funniest man in the town. 
Long may he live to bring joy to the heart, 
May his sunshine fore'er light the town, 
A 
true friend of all who " act on the square," 
Is this jolly oil fellow— the clown.

KILLARNEY, 
Written by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Sung in ED. HARRIGAN'S Irish Drama, " Shamus O'Brien." 
Oh, Irish boys and girls, draw dear, 
We'd whisper soft to ye; 
The way we love, like turtle doves 
Upon a 
bush or tree. 
Between there's no conceit, 
Oh, it really is a 
treat, 
To sit beside the flowing tide, 
Of the lakes of sweet Killarney. 
CHORUS. 
Killarny, (
sym.) Killarney, och hone, 
Oh, beautiful Killarney. 
They say America's mighty great, 
And has its brooks and lakes, 
A 
man might live in royal state, 
Be fed on ducks and drakes; 
But here we'll be content, 
As long as we have our rent, 
And stay at home, and never roam 
From the lakes of sweet Killarney. 
Killarney, etc. 
The little spec that's on the sea, 
They can it Ireland, 
It's large enough to shelter we, 
And for it we do stand; 
For the Lord above is just, 
At some future day we must 
Rule every mile in that happy isle, 
Where flows the sweet Killarney.

'Use longing for the good ole times we used to hab of yore 
When we labored in de cotton and de corn, 
And eb'ry night de darkies gather'd ' round de cabin door 
To de calling ob de mellow bugle horn; 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring, 
De ole fiddle and de bones made music too, 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
Caoltus. 
We would dance and we would sing to de banjo's happy ring, 
De ole fiddle and de bones made music too. 
And eb'ry charming yaller gal would to her lover cling, 
While all our hearts were honest, kind and true. 
Our ole plasm used to like defun and laugh'd to see de reels 
Dat the boys and girls were always sure to dance, 
And when the ' picaninny nigs ' would turn upon dar heels 
De ole man would join dem in dar merry prance ; 
Tho' he used to give us blows when among de cotton rows, 
lie was kind to us when daily toil was o'er, 
And eb'ry one dat worked upon the old plantation knows 
His heart was bigger dan our sunny shore. 
(Chorus). 
We have heard he joined de army after sending us away 
And was killed in battle down in Tennessee, 
And SOMC One else has told us dat dey heard ole missus say 
lie was sleeping ' neath de ole Palmetto*tree; 
If de last report is so, all of us would gladly go 
And shed upon his grave a 
friendly tear, 
For eber since we left him we have felt the keenest woe, 
Dar's nothing for de worn out darkey here.

BANJO SOLO. 
Wrtiten by ROY LESLIE for BILLY CARTER. 
I'll sing a 
song of a 
nice young man, 
Who thought himself a 
masher, 
lie told the girls he was clerk in a 
bank, 
But the truth he was a 
hasher, 
Ile would work from sunrise in the morn 
Until his lunch was over, 
Then he'd dress himself up 
In a 
ten dollar suit and he'd go out on the mash, sir. 
Cuouus. 
Ile was born in the Fall, 
This man with a 
gall, 
So loud he would bawl 
For hash through the hall, 
lie laid over them all 
And he'd run them to the wall 
And he never would fall, 
This curly headed hasher. 
One day when the matinee was out, 
Ho met a 
charming lady, 
lie called her his love and turtle dove 
And then she called him baby, 
Some time after this to his hotel 
Went this charming lady, 
And she saw her mash a 
slicing his hash, 
On her head he spilt some gravy. 
CHORUS. 
When he saw his mash 
He dropped with a 
crash 
A plate full of hash, 
From the room he did dash 
As quick as a 
flash, 
lie shook his mash 
As quick as a 
flash, 
This curly headed hasher.

A IR— " Kiss Me Again.
" 
ONE in this bright world to me is fair, 
Voice like an angel and dark flowing hair. 
Sweetly does life give moments of bliss, 
Sealing our love with an angelic kiss. 
Swiftly the moments are passing away, 
Quickly the dawn of life is turning gray; 
But every moment, as life is growing old, 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
CHORUS. 
Better than gold with sweet thoughts I 
love thee, 
Nothing can ever unfold, 
Better than gold with feelings untold ; 
Darling, I 
love you far better than gold. 
When your dark eyes are beaming in mine, 
Firing my heart like the nectar of wine, 
Thou art ever the same unto me, 
Filling my bosom with love's ecstacy, 
Wafting my soul to the realms of the blest, 
Passing and leaving love's wild unrest; 
Then if you love me why treat me so cold? 
Whom my heart praises far better than gold. 
Better than gold, etc. 
Would you still love, through trouble and woe ? 
Follow my footsteps wherever I 
go? 
Ever to thee my poor heart will cling, 
Loving and trusting whatever may bring. 
Let ill betide or lay at thy door, 
Still I 
will love thee the same evermore. 
All the sweet secrets my heart cad unfold 
Tells me I 
love you far better than gold. 
Better than gold, etc. 
"'BLESS YOU, MOLLIE DEAR."'

Beautiful Snow. 
Written and composed by Brt.t. DEVERE, and recited with rounds of ap. 
plause by DAN COLLYER. 
Oh the snow, the beautiful snow„ 
That flies in your face wherever you go, 
That's twisted and twirled in the dreary street, 
Till it blinds your poor eyes and freezes your feet. 
Its all very fine, this " beautiful snow," 
If you've a 
blunt in your pocket, and somewhere to go; 
But the poet was born in the summer, I 
know, 
That finds something pretty in " beautiful snow." 
Beautiful, is it ? 
Humph, " beautiful snow." 
The thermometer just three degrees below, 
Your " benjamin hocked," not a 
cent in your " hick," 
And " beautiful snow" till you can't see a 
brick 
In the sidewalks around in a 
dreary town, 
And that beautiful snow is still coming down. 
If I 
had a 
room with a 
fire all aglow, 
I 
could envy the " Guy " that wrote " Beautiful Snow." 
Beautiful, is it ? " Beautiful snow," 
When it falls on a 
sinner with nowhere to go. 
It seems to me now (I'm a 
practical man, 
And no lovesick damsel or innocent lamb; 
Therefore it cannot be expected, you know, 
To stand on my head about " beautiful snow." 
It seems to me, though) that the poet should go 
And bury himself in his " beautiful snow." 
"Beautiful snow from the heavens above, 
Pure as an angel, gentle as love." 
I 
wish they would keep it in heaven, not throw 
So much down on earth of that " beautiful snow." 
" 
Gentle as love," how can they say so? 
See how it sticks ; it never will go ; 
March, April, May might come and might go, 
And still we'd be blest with that " beautiful snow."

AIN'T YOU AWFUL, 
Written and Composed by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
Arranged by R. 
STEIRLY. 
Published by E. II, HARDING, 288 Bowery, New York: 
I 
TOOK my love one evening, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' the silent arbors gleaming, 
Where cupid has control. 
I 
wanted to tell her, 
How dearly I 
adored her; 
But Oh ! she wouldn't listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly implor'd her, 
Oh I 
love, oh ! love, why don't you heed tnek, 
How can you treat me so. 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turn'd away her head, 
Aud this was all she said. 
Oh! ain't you awful, 
It's wrtm,g you know, to love me so, 
Yes you are awful, 
Your like I 
ne'er did see; 
Oh! ain't you awful, 
It's wrong you know, to love me so, 
Dear me you're horrid, 
Why don't you let me be. 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said rd like to see her, 
Say yes and ease my mind, 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention; 
She said mamma woull scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention, 
Come love I 
cried we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind, 
Oh no, oh no, she said, 
Don't ask me now to wed, 
What would the people say, 
If we should run away? 
Oh! ain't you swim% 
She talk'd on useless matters. 
Till my patience was in Waal, 
Just : 
3 
a 
woman clatters, 
Whe.i silent she should be, 
I 
begg'd her to listen, 
And drew her close beside MC ; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes delieil me, 
And soon she told me with a 
inuii0 
That she did not care for me, 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain. 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said.

PAT AND THE WIDOW. 
IRISH SONG. 
IN Ballinaha wanst there dwelt a 
fair widdy, 
Renown'd thro' the country for beauty a
-nd wit, 
Tho' coorted by many she cared not for any, 
For.Pat wid a 
love-shaft her bosom had hit. 
Oh the glance of her eye sure it bother'd the county, 
I Twos bright as the dew on the fresh morning grass, 
And her smile so inviting, set all the boys fighting, 
And kindled the envy of many a 
lass, 
And her smile so inviting set all the boys lighting, 
And kindled the envy of many a 
lass. 
But Pat was unhappily given to dhrinking, 
And widow O'Grady objected to this, 
For Pat when in whisky was apt to get frisky, 
And folks said he often made off wid a 
kiss. 
Be that as it may, sure the widow spoke plainly, 
And tould him this drinking he'd have to give o'er, 
For she never would marry him while she had to carry him, 
Drunk and insensible home to I:is door, 
No, she would never marry him while she had to carry him, 
Drunk and insensible home to his door. 
So what did he do but he made her a 
promise. 
On Irish ground never to taste spirits more, 
But a 
week after that, and to widow saw Pat, 
And he drunk in a 
boat an ,l 
asleep on his oar. 
As sung by the RICHMOND SISTERS. 
I 
know a 
little Colleen, 
I 
dearly love her well, 
And often in the twilight, 
I 
meet her in the dell ; 
She's fairer than the starlight, 
I'm going to see her soon ; 
She promised here to meet me, 
At the rising of the moon. 
CHORUS. 
For her voice it is soft and light, 
[Break. 
Her golden hair, in ringlets bright, 
[Break. 
And while I'm waiting for her 
I'll sing a 
merry tune; 
She promised here to meet me 
At the rising of tit& moon. 
The ring is bought, the day is named, 
The knot will soon be tied, 
And ere another week is past, 
I'll make my love a 
bride ; 
We'll get old Dan the piper, 
His merry pipes to time. 
And we'll dance away the evening, 
At the rising of the moon. 
For her voice, drz. 
[Danee. 
I'LL sing to you of a 
red-headed gal, 
Who lived in dis yer town, 
She was de boss waiter in a 
big hotel, 
Dat was kept by a 
man named Brown. 
She had carroty red eyes and pink blue hair, 
And they called her bungo Sal, 
And she fell in love wid a 
captain with whiskers, 
WIK, run on de raging canal. 
He courted her with all his might, 
And loved her full well, 
And treated his darling every night, 
To peanuts upon the half shell. 
He took her out to ride one day, 
his darling bungo 
When the mule took the tooth-ache and pitched dem in— 
De middle of de raging canal. 
But the captain he proved false to her, 
His darling bungo Sal, 
And she met him in his Sunday clothes, 
In company with a 
tin-ware gal. 
When Sally found her love was false. 
It nearly broke her heart, 
And she stabbed herself one fine day, 
With the shell of a 
crab apple tart. 
Now the tin-ware gal went crazy then. 
Tore her hair and rung her hands, 
And drowned her in self defence, . 
In one of her large dish pans; 
And the captain with the whiskers distracted went. 
And since has never been seen, 
So he cut off his whiskers and died with the croup, 
For the wearing of the green. 
Sung by the FOY SISTERS. 
Passing 'neath thy window dearest, 
Joy it did impart. 
For thy lovely face appearedst, 
Ah! then I 
lost my heart ; 
Alas! alas ! ' neath thy window, 
Alas! alas ! alas! neath thy window, alas! 
'Tis thee that forever is seeking, 
This heart in its tenderness speaking 
Of thee, that night oft I 
dreamed, 
Thou foundst it, so it seemed, 
Alas! alas! neath thy window, 
Alas! alas! alas! 'neath thy window, 
Alas! I 
have lost, I 
have lost my heart, 
I 
have lost, I 
have lost my heart. 
You have lost beneath my window, 
Your precious heart, alas! 
'Tis an accident most woeful, 
How could it come to pass? 
Alas! alas! ' neath my window, alas! 
Alas! alas! 'math my window, alas I 
'Tis the man of heart I 
am seeking, 
Truly and honestly speaking 
If it came across my track, 
Surely I 
would send it back.

Alas! alas! 'neath my window, alas! 
Ah! I

-THE REPENTANT DRUNKARD. 
An Original Mom) SONG. 
Sung by W A.YNE LOVELY, in 
their Sketch of Southern home before the War. 
Sung with 
immense success. 
One hundred nights in succession. 
Good evening, kind friends, it's how do you do ? 
As a 
miserable drunkard I 
now appear before you ; 
My clothes are all torn, my fraine speaks decay; 
As I 
travel through life, I'm drunk every day. 
I 
once had a 
home, two children to love, 
Through cold and hunger God took them above; 
I 
would not support them, but left them alone, 
And thought it far better a 
drunkard to roam. 
Now, to all hard drinkers, I'll say a 
kind word— 
If you have a 
good home, be not a 
wand'ring bird; 
Shun all these bad vices, to your family prove true, 
And you'll find that the world will think better of you. 
But the day of repentance has now come to pass, 
I'll finish my song, with the drunkard's last glass; 
I'm sure I'll feel better, out of misery and pain— 
Good-night, my dear friends, I'll not drink vain I 
THE COT AT THE HILL. 
Composed by HARRY OSBORNE and sung with great success by 
FINNY W 
ENTWORTH. 
Oh, how often my mind retraces joy past, 
When childhood and youth knew no care, 
How I 
rambled with Kate, the pride of Newlas, 
Plucking wild flowers to wreath in her hair. 
How oft did our playmates stare at us and prate, 
In that ancient old town near the mill, 
When returning from rambles with beautiful Kate. 
Seeing her home to that c ,t 
at the hill, 
I 
remember how often her eyes they would beam, 
When I'd tell her a 
sweet tale of love, 
How my mind was enraptured with youth's happy dream, 
Oh how blest by our ruler above, 
Then oh shall we part from ach other at last. 
Leave that love we bear fade with wili; 
Oh no I 
would seek for to moulder and pasa 
In a 
grave at the foot of you bill

LOCK DAT LION'S JAW. 
As originally sung by Goss and Fox. 
We'll lock dat lion's jaw. 
We'll lock dat lion's jaw, 
We'll lock dat lion's jaw, 
When we get on Canaan's shore, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on, 
We'll get home by and by, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on. 
We'll get on Canaan's shore, 
Sunday morning, 
Hold your light, Monday morning, 
Hold your light, Tuesday morning, 
Hold your light on Mount Calvary. 
Hold your light, Monday morning, 
Hold your light, Tuesday morning, 
Hold your light on Mount Calvary. 
We'll hold old Jonah down, 
We'll hold old Jonah down, 
Well hold old Jonah down, 
When we get on Canaan's shore, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on, 
We'll get home by and by, 
Little children can't you hold on, hold on, 
We'll land on Canaan's shore, 
Sunday morning. 
Hold your light, Monday morning, 
Hold your light, Tuesday morning, 
Hold your light on Mount Calvary. 
Hold your light, Monday morning' 
Hold your light, Tuesday morning, 
Hold your light on Mount Calvary.

" 
AIN'T I PRETTY ?" 
Song and bailee, written and composed for Chancy Sturges, 
Words by it. P. Chase, Music by Rollin Howard. Published 
with a 
beautiful Lithographic title, by Harris, B'way, 
N. Y. City, and Troy N. Y. 
In a 
little cot by the brookside, 
Dwells a 
sweet one with lovely golden hair, 
It's of this little dear I 
will tell you, 
With a 
dashing style that is .very rare. 
You should : ee her for she is bewitching, 
When she is dressed up in her suit of light blue, 
And looking up says " now, ain't I 
pretty ?" 
Tell me sweetness, oh ! tell me, ain't it true?" 
CHORUS. 
When she stands before her mirror, 
And I 
her try to please, 
Then I'll tell her that I 
love her, 
And then she'll coax and tease, 
Then she'll look up with a 
smile, she's so witty! 
" 
If you love me, tell me, ain't your darling pretty." 
The other morning we went out walking, 
And took a 
promenade upon the green, 
And I 
only wish you could have seen us, 
Such a 
gay sight never before was seen. 
tell you the lads they all me envy, 
And I 
so very unconcerned do seem, 
Yes, I 
think I 
heard " oh ! ain't she pretty?" 
A dozen times upon that vilage green. 
Chorus, 
But still these happy days are passing, 
And soon will be the day she'll be my bride, 
Oh I 
how dear I 
love the little darling, 
As through the future happy years we'll glide. 
To see her you'd envy and not pity, 
For all my cherished hopes I've centered there, 
The first thing you'd say " oh ! ain't she pretty," 
With her flowing locks of bright golden hair. 
Chorus.

A SMILE WAS ALL HE G-AVE ME. 
Written and sung by Bobby Newcomb. 
Not long ago, I 
was the beau 
Of a 
pretty girl, named Mary; 
With a 
face so sweet, and a 
slyle so neat 
And a 
step just like a 
fairy. 
We courted long, our love was strong: 
How I 
wished that she would have me! 
But when I 
did the qtkestion pop: 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
CLEOBUS. 
And she was so fair, I 
do declare, 
How I 
wished that she would have mei, 
But when I 
did the question pop : 
A 
smile was all she g 
tve me. 
I 
sent her notes, I 
sent her flowers, 
I 
took her out a- riding: 
How quick time flies when love and sighs 
Are with the hours gliding! 
A 
rival was my only fear: 
And I 
couldn't think, to save me, 
That when I 
asked her who he was, 
A 
smile was all she gave me. 
At last, a 
note, I 
got one day, 
And dreadful news it carried, 
Inviting me to come and see— 
Herself and rival married! 
Now off I 
went, on death was bent, 
Resolved that none should save me— 
But I 
am not dead, though she got wed, 
And a 
smile was all she gave me.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is me old-

published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
nese Cards are arr.nged and printed in series—Harts, Clubs, Dia-
naonds and Spades—and each or these into K 
-for King, Q for Queen, 
and K 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
tour rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many ot the an , 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
,been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. Many professional Fortune- Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to thorn from all parts of the U. B.

Courting Cards.— This Series of Cards has been arranged 
46 meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result a 
this dilemma, many 
lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
