SUNNY CAL 4147 60B1
Jack Bryant Firebaugh, 1940
You've all heard the story Of old Sunny Cal The place where it never rains They say it
don't know how.
They say, “Come on, you Okies, Work is easy found Bring along your cotton pack You can
pick the whole year round.
Get your money ever' night Spread your blanket on the ground It' s always bright and
warm You can sleep right on the ground.”
But listen to me Okies I came out here one day Spent all my money getting here Now I
can't get away.
