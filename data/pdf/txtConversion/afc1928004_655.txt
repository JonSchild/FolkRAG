NEW CaCK IN OUR KITCHEN. 
'BITTEN AND SUNG BY J. C. MURPHY. 
An; 
THERE'S A 
LETTER IN THE CANDLE,. 
There's a 
new cook in our kitchen, 
And I 
know that she's no good; 
For the way she burns the vitles up, 
rind distroys all the wood. 
She's a 
robust great big Irish girl, 
And weighs three hundred pounds; 
saw Beecher trying to hug her, 
But he couldn't reach all round. 
CHORUS. 
Big cook, little cook pray listen unto Me. 
Please hurry up dinner, I 
must start soon you Seel 
Give me whet you got before it is too late, 
And if the hash it isn't done, give me 
some raw beef stake, 
The landlady's got her dander up, 
The cook's burnt up the bread; 
The dish-rag's in the coffee pot, 
It almost kills me dead 
Fried potatoes in the sugar bowl: 
And the beets all over the butter, 
But the cook keeps working just the same, 
As if nothing was the matter. 
Chorus. 
The devil's in the kitchen now, 
The cook's burnt up the ham, 
The chambermaid is in the row, 
And got hit with a 
pan. 
Our dinner flying round the room, 
There goes the oyster fry. 
Who threw that dam big biscuit, 
'at struck me in the eye. 
Choral.

Our Little Alice is Gone.

Our little Alice now is dead, 
Put her in her little grave; 
Our hearts with grief was very deep, 
But see—the vituels we save.

Johnny's Little Dog. 
Tie the bull dog in the wood shed, 
Little Johnny's passed away; 
Give my checkered pants to sister, 
She may fill them up some day.

Her Little Hand. 
I 
took her little baud in mine, 
Embraced her beauteous form, 
I 
swore I'd shield her from the beast, 
And from the world's cold storm. 
She cast her little eyes on me, 
While tears did wildly flow, 
And with her little mouth she said, 
Gosh hang it, let me go.

eood Advice. 
I 
advise you all to aid, 
No matter where you meet 
One of our crippled soldiers, 
A 
hobbling long the street. 
Their valor has brought forth 
To this country much affplause, 
They fought beneath our good old flag, 
And for our country's cause.

TPE HONEST WORKING MAN, 
BY J. C. MURPHY. 
AIR; 
COULDN'T STAY, AWAY. 
Our country's in a 
dreadful fix, 
At present, now you'll own; 
There's sad, distress, and sorrow, 
In every workman's home. 
Our fathers have been trying, 
And have done all they can, 
To lower, disgrace, and trample on 
The honest working man. 
CHORUS. 
So workmen don't surrender, 
Don't work like slaves for them, 
But make them yet remember 
The honest working man. 
Repeat. 
In the morning when the wealthy 
Lay wrapped in sweet repose, 
The poor man from his slumber rises, 
And oft to work he goes. 
His limbs are tired and weary. 
But what matter's that to them; 
Tiredness must never come 
To the honest working man. 
Who built those noble vessels, 
That sails the ocean wide; 
That travels far and near, my boys, 
Those flyers of the Clyde. 
Far, far, across the ocean, 
In many's the distant land, 
The skill is often envied 
Of the honest working man. 
It often has been written, 
Columbia rules the waves, 
But it never has been written, 
That she has so many slaves. 
So let us unite together, 
And we'll have no fathers then, 
But have the rights that do belong„ 
To our honest working man.

Little Willie's Dead. 
WRITTEN AND KING BY J. C. MURPHY. 
Little Willie had a 
purple monkey, 
Climbing up a 
yellow stick, 
And Willie licked the paint all off, 
Which made him deathly sick. 
No more he'll pull the pussy's tail. 
And make it cry for fun. 
No mote he'll shoot his sister 
With his little wooden gun 
The pussy's tail it sticks out straight, 
The gun is laid aside, 
The monkey don't slitub up the stick 
Since Little Willie's died. 
So lay away those little britches, 
Do not mend one single hole, 
For Willie never more will wear them, 
For now he climbs the golden pole. 
00' 
Mr. Morton's Dead. 
Mr. Morton's dead, jam him in a 
coffin, 
We don't have such a 
chance for a 
funeral often, 
Rush him round right to the cemetary, 
And chuck him ints a 
bole, with his uncle Jerry. 
The Pawn Broker. 
Here lies the remains of oln Ten per cent, 
The more he made the less he spent, 
The more he made the more he craved, 
If he ain't darned we'll all be saved. 
MURPHY'S MOTHER 
MOTHER IN LAW. 
yARODI ON, TAKE THIS LETTER TO MY MuTHER. 
w7HTTES AND SUNG BY .7. C. MURPHY. 
I'd feel better if my wifes mother 
Was at the bottom of the sea; 
The love is tart we bear each other, 
The old rhionoceros she hates me. 
Oh! how I'd like to bite her leg off, 
Oh ! how she can scratch and claw; 
No one knows the pain I 
suffer, 
With my old crank of a 
mother-in-law. 
I'd feel better it' my wife's mother 
Would take the lock-jaw, and let me be; 
Oh how I 
would like to smother 
My mother-in-law, for she's N. G. 
The cross-eyed, crooked-shanked, old crumuging, 
She never was known to hold her jaw; 
Who will pity a 
lone lost orphan, 
Left in the hands of a 
mother-in-law. 
I 
once was fat, but now look at me, 
I'm as thin as she back of a 
cross-cut saw; 
No chills or fever could ever attack me, 
With the same affect as my mother-in-law. 
1'11 go jump the frozen ocean. " 
There I'll wait till there conies a 
thaw, 
No, by gum, I'll change my notion, 
That might suit my mother-in-law. 
I 
d 
feel better if my wife's mother, 
In a 
wilad gale would get blown away, 
I 
know my gizzard would then feel easy, 
Then my wife and myself at home could stay. 
But the red-headed, dryed-up, old baboon, 
She's determined never to shut her jaw; 
If I 
should die some day sudden, 
I'd blame it all on my mother-in-law.

Into its coffin slid.

And joined the other kid.

Willie's Ball. 
Little Willie's mother bought him a 
little ball, 
Little Willie smashed the looking glass, 
That was hanging on the wall. 
Little Willie's mother heard the pieces fall, 
Now little Willie will never toss that little ball. 
Little Willie's ma threw the ball away, 
Little Willie he got mad and to his ma did say,

little bell, 
You and the ball, ma, can both go to ( breakfast.)

She looks just like an angel, 
That came down from above.

Gone again, keep a

Gone again, keep a

My Linda am the sweetest gall, 
That ever you did see; 
She says there ain't no other nig, 
That's half so sweet as me. 
Her nose it am a

Her cheeks am cherry red, 
And when she'd dance the flewey, 
She kills the wenches dead. 
Chorus. 
She's handsome as a 
holly-hawk, 
A 
charming mushroon blonde, 
With gimlet eyes and freckled feet, 
And weighs five hundred pounds. 
She's graceful as an elephant, 
That flys from flower to flower, 
The nigs they say she's homely, 
But I 
think their grapes am sour.

A 
CARD OF GINGER BREAO. 
BUNG BY J. C. MURPHY. 
The stars was shining silvery bright. 
The moon had gone to bed; 
When Sal and I 
to the baker's went, 
To buy some ginger bread. 
For many an hour in her sweet oower, 
• I 
there recline my head; 
And I 
seen something on her lip, 
'Twas a 
card of ginger-bread. 
A 
handkerchief, I 
said, conic here, 
My Sallie's cold and dead, 
She choked herself one rainy night, 
While eating ginger-bread. 
We buried her behind a 
barn, 
Just where the fence was red, 
And I 
erected for her tomb, 
A 
card of ginger bread.

He shot Billy Twig in the middle of the wig,

DANCE ME ON TAR KNEE, 
PARODY. 
SUNG BY J. C. MURPHY. 
When I 
was but a 
little boy, 
My mother says to me, 
Be careful Johnny, where you go, 
When you get in your teens. 
Some young girl may entice you, 
And cause you to leave poor me, 
And the next I'll hear about you, 
You'll be dancing on her knee. 
Cnouns. 
So dance me on your knee, my darling, 
Dance me on your knee; 
Put your head upon my breast, 
It pleases me, you see. 
Squeeze me tight, don't let me fall, 
For I 
am not afraid at all. 
So dance me, darling, dance me, 
Dance me on your knee. 
I 
met a 
daisy on the street, 
She slyly winked at me; 
My mother's words came tr, my mind, 
Says 1, daisy, let me be. 
. 
She threw a 
kiss across the street, 
She won my heart you see. 
That night she had me sure enough, 
A 
dancing on her knee. 
Ch OMB. 
Her mother happened in one night, 
And when she seen me there; 
Her voice cried out like a 
big giraff, 
As she gently raised a 
chair. 
Git, says she, you bet, says I, 
II was glad to get scott free, 
You'll never catch me there again, 
A 
dancing on her knee.

OUT OF WORK. 
SUNG BY J. C. MURPFIY. 
For hours along the crowded street, 
With aimless steps I 
trod, 
Without a 
home or hope in life, 
With scarce a 
hope in God. 
This cruel night is fitting close 
To such a 
crushing day; 
The earth is, oh ! so dreary cold, 
And Heaven so far away. 
The friendless rouse no anxious thoughts. 
The busy throng sweeps on; 
I've strayed beyond the city's lights, 
The twilight's gray has gone. 
My useless arms have failed to win, 
A 
crust, a 
place to stay; 
Earth has no work, no room for me, 
And Heaven is far away. 
0, great wide world ! 0, frowning sky, 
So cheerless and so vast, 
I 
dare your keen and cutting sleet, 
Your piercing, bitter blast; 
Rage, howl and lash this living spark 
From out the tortured clay, 
That feels existence dark, all dark, 
And Heaven so far away. 
How dark and black beside my 
feet, 
The sluggish river rolls; 
It beckons as a 
demon might 
To lure unhappy souls. 
Its slimy voice is whispering, 
Here, rest in peace for aye, 
0, God ! the river is so near, 
And Heaven is so forever.

SHE'S GONE TO BE AN ANGEL. 
BUNG BY T. C. MIJRPEY. 
Ifl sing you a 
little song, 
And tea you a 
story that's strange; 
About a 
wicked young gall, 
Her front name was Sal. 
She drove me mad, crazy, deranged, 
We first met on the street, 
She fell all over my feet, 
She poligized gently. 
, 
Saying—Excuse my awkward feet, 
Crionus. 
She's gone to be an angel, 
Pushing clouds up in the skies, 
If ever she reaches that holy land, 
I 
never want to die. 
If ever she joins the angel band, 
There'll be a 
eromotion sure, 
They'll raise a 
base ball sturbance, 
On Hallalula shore. 
She Simg a 
little song, 
As she put her arm in mine, 
'Twas Silver threads amongst the gold, 
And I 
thought it awful fine. 
But I've changed my mind since then, 
I 
think it bass and corse, 
Like the captain of a 
canal scow, 
Twas rusty, rough and hoarse 
Chorus. 
She took me to her home, 
Her mother fired me out, 
With clubs they pummelled about thy head, 
And for help I 
loud did shout. 
They busted my new suspenders, 
Six fat policemen came, 
And I 
three months served in the work house, 
Beamse I 
could find no bail.

SUNG BY J. C. KURPEiY. 
! 
white folks listen now, 
Come listen to my ditty; 
I 
just came to your town, 
Unto your busy city. 
Fm a 
country girl quite free. 
My maiden name is Tilly, 
And I 
just come out to see, 
If I 
can find my Billy. 
He came to us one day, 
His trousers needed mending; 
Oh! he could dance and sing, 
Beat any circus man a-bending. 
But now he's gone away, 
And left his little Tilly, 
f 
sigh for him all day, 
IT die without my Billy. 
S. 
To the one that brings him back, 
I'll pay ten dollars in a 
flutter, 
In silver, or green-backc. 
Or a 
check on old Ben 
Just tell him, that his owli, 
His dear, his darling Tilly, 
fins took to drinking beer, 
a-use she can't find her Billy. 
I 
saw a 
pigeon making bread; 
I 
saw a 
girl composed of thread; 
I 
saw a 
towel one mile square; 
I 
saw a 
meadow in the air; 
I 
saw a 
rocket walk a 
mile; 
I 
saw a 
pony make a 
file; 
I 
saw a 
blacksmith in a 
box; 
I 
saw an orange kill an ox; 
I 
saw a 
butcher made of steel; 
I 
saw a 
penknife dance a 
reel; 
I 
saw a 
sailor twelve feet high; 
I 
saw a 
ladder in a 
pie; 
I 
saw an apple fly away; 
I 
saw a 
sparrow making hay; 
I 
saw a 
farmer like a 
dog; 
I 
saw a 
puppy mixing grog; 
I 
saw three men who saw these too, 
And will confirm what I 
tell you,

The papers are rehashing the old Berry story, and 
they don't conclude it in accordance with facts. This 
is the correct version; A 
celebrated comedian arranged 
with his green grocer, one Berry, to pay him quarterly 
but Berry once sent in his account long before the 
quarter was due. 
Thereupon the comedian in great 
wrath called upon the grocer and said to him; 
" 
I 
say here's a 
pretty niull, Berry; you've sent in 
your bill, Berry; 
before it is due, Berry. 
Your 
falher, the elder, Berry; would not have been such a 
goose, Berry; but you needn't look so blue, Berry; 
for I 
don't care a 
straw, Berry; and if you come here 
again before June, Berry; I'll kick your rasp, 
Berry; 
n.util it is black, Berry.

THE SAINT'S DREAM., 
SUNG BY I. C. MURPHY, 
Ons night, asnld St. Peter slept, 
He left the door of Heaven ajar, 
When through a 
little angel crept, 
And came down with a 
falling star. 
One summer as the blessed beams 
Of morn approached my blushing bride, 
Awakened from some pleasing dreams, 
And found that angel by her side. 
God grant but this, I 
asl no more— 
That when he leaves this world of pain, 
He'll wing his way to that bright shore, 
And find his way to Heaven again. 
00 
T. PETER'S REPLY. 
Full eighteen hundred years or more 
I've kept my gate securely tied; 
There has no " little angel" strayed, 
Nor no one been missing all the while. 
I 
did not sleep, as you supposed, 
Nor leave the door of Heaven ajar. 
Nor has a 
little angel left, 
And gone down with a 
falling star. 
Go ask the blushing bride and see 
If she don't frankly own and say. 
That when she found that angel babe, 
She found it in the good old way. 
God grant but this I 
ask no more, 
That should your number still enlarge, 
You will not do as done before, 
And lay it to old Peter's ch,Lrge.

And everywhere that Charley went,

Which happened to be near, 
And when the teacher booted him out, 
He walked off on his ear. 
iteturning home, he met a

And at this cow did fly, 
lie tossed him up rive hundred feet., 
Now how is that for high.

When Chancy heard his darlings fate, 
Scarcely a

The gospel train am coming,

hear her close at hand; 
I 
hear dem car wheels rolling, 
And a 
rumbling through de land. 
I 
hear de bell and whistle, 
It's coming round de curve, 
It's straining every muscle, 
And a 
busting every nerve. 
CHORUS. 
Den get on board, little children, 
Get on board, little children, 
Get on board little children, 
Dere's room for many more. 
It's nearing now de station, 
Oh ! sinners don't be vain; 
But come and get your tickets, 
Get ready for de train. 
I 
think it will make a 
little halt, 
And stop upon the line, 
And give you all a 
chance to go, 
But she will make her time. 
No signal for another train, 
To follow on this line; 
Oh ! sinner's you're for ever lost, 
If you get left behind. 
The fare am cheap and all can go, 
The rich the poor am t 
here, 
No second class on board this train, 
No difference in the fare.

THE TOM CAT. 
RECITATION. 
RECITE') BY J. C. MURPHY 
THE DOG AND CAT. 
The Thomas eat sat on a 
pump, 
Whence no cat yet had fled, 
And the slippers flying through the air; 
Were threatening his head. 
Yet beautiful and bright he stood, 
As born to stand a 
bang, 
creature of the feline blood, 
Who don't give a 
clang. 
Old shoes flew on, he would not go, 
Because he knew just how to dodge 'em. 
And the shoes would miss that cat, 
No matter how they'd lodge ' ern. 
He whispered low; I'll hold the pump, 
If yet nay head is stun, 
He knew he didn't want to stay, 
He was too lame to run. 
' 
Speak fellers, once again," he cried, 
" 
If I 
may yet be gone—" 
A 
shower of brick-bats then replied, 
And still the cat held on. 
Then came a 
crash of thundering sound, 
The eat, where was he? 
There he was lying on the ground, 
With a 
brick-bat on his knee. 
BANJO SOLO, 
SUNG BY I. C. NORPHYt 
There was a'alan he had a 
dog a 
bob tail honery cuss, 
And that ere dog got that ere man in many an 
ugly muss, 
For the man was on his mussel, and the dog 
was on the bite, 
And to hit that dog on animal, would raise a 
dog on fight. 
There was a 
woman she had a 
cat that fought 
as fourteen pounds, 
All other cats got up and slid, when that ere cat 
was round; 
Thirty nine Elm street was the place where she 
could be seen, 
A 
wrestling the eat at 6 
A. M. out upon the green. 
The man and his dog came by one day but 
scarcely got in sight, 
When the bull dog growled ferociously all 
anxious for a 
fight, 
The man cried go, it was enough, a 
sign that 
never fails, 
That dog he went straight for that cat, with 
head teeth and toe nails, 
The clog he tried to chew the cat, but the cat he 
wouldn't be thawed 
He lit right on the bull dog's back, and clawed, 
and chewed, and chawed; 
lie sent his teeth in doggy's flesh, golly, how 
the hair did fly, 
But the dog was chuck full of grit, and never 
yelled ki-yi. 
The man he swore most awfully, as he gathered 
a 
big brick bat, 
But the neighbors they now interfeared, and 
took sides with the cat; 
The cat he chewed the bull dog's tail, which 
made the bull dog howl, 
The man said he bit below the belt and made a 
claim for foul. 
His lip hung down, so did his jaw, when foul 
was not allowed, 
The cat it soon had killed the dog, which greatly 
pleased the crowd, 
The woman yelled, get out of this, as she 
grabbed an old gun, 
Its contents cought in the coat tail, duck shot, No. 1.

BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY. 
RECITATION. 
RECITED BY J. C. MURPHY. 
In speaking of a 
persons faults, 
Pray, don't forget your own; 
Remember, those with houses of glass, 
Should seldom throw a 
stone. 
If we have nothing else to do, 
But talk of those who sin, 
'Tis better we commence at home, 
And from that point begin. 
We have no right to judge a 
man 
Until he's fairly tried, 
Should we not. like his company, 
We know this world is wide. 
Some may have faults, and mho has net, 
The old as well as the young, 
Perhaps we nisy, for what we know, 
Have fifty to their one. 
I'll tell you of a 
better plan, 
And I 
find it works full well, 
To try my own defects to cure, 
Before of others tell. 
And though I 
sometimes hope to be, 
No worse than some I 
know, 
My own short comings bid me let 
The faults of others go. 
Then let us all when we commence, 
To slander friend or foe; 
Think of the harm one may do 
To those w little know. 
Remember, curses, sometimes, 
Like our chickens, roost at home, 
So don't speak of other's faults, 
Until you. have none of your own. 
GRAND DISSAVING VIEWS 
AIR; CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
SUNG BY J. C. MIIRP1114 
While thinking of some past events, 
At home the other night, 
And sitting by my cheerful fire, 
Which then was burning bright, 
At length the fire began to fade, 
The shades then o'er it grew. 
I 
fancied I 
was future seeing, 
Some grand dissolving views. 
Some views there were that gave me joy, 
While others gave me pain, 
And may I 
never see them in reality again. 
So give me your attention, 
And I'll quickly tell to you, 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in 
Those grand dissolving views. 
The first a 
view of sad distress, 
A 
truly wretched case; 
The family of a 
workingman, 
Want, stares them in the face, 
The mother and her children, 
Huddled round a 
scanty fire, 
Of embers rather threatening, 
Every moment to expire, 
• 
At length the father enters, 
He hangs his honest head, 
While silently he hands to each, 
Their share of poor house bread. 
Through poverty he has to steal, 
Though doomed to jail he knew, 
A 
sad but truthful picture in 
This grand dissolving view. 
The next scene was a 
police court, 
Two prisoners in were led, 
One was a 
well-dressed swindler, 
The other a 
boy that was ill fed. 
He had stolen food, confessed his guilt, 
For pardon did entreat; 
He said I 
am an orphan boy and nothing haul to eat 
i>ix months hard labor was his doom, 
The tears rolled down his face. 
While he who'd stolen money, 
Got off with his good grace. 
He paid the counsel with the spelt 
'Twits money pulled him through, 
While justice blind in silence smiled, 
On this grand dissolving view.

SHE DIED ON THE STREET/ 
SUNG BY J. C. NIFRPHY. 
Dark was the night and the snow it was falling, 
Streets all deserted, the wind bleak and chill, 
Those who were happy were silently sleeping, 
Death in. its mantle could not be more still. 
Hark to a 
noise—heavens, some one is crying! 
Some one to-night is suffering, I 
fear, 
"Help me, oh ! help me, 0 ! Lord I 
am dying, 
Must I 
die friendless is noboby near.

CHORUS. 
Starving and crying, friendless and dying, 
Wandering about, but no friend could she meet; 
Cold winds a-teasing, her poor heart a-freezing, 
Heaven relieved her, she died on the street. 
Once I 
was young and as pure as a 
dew-drop, 
Often my parents were asked for my hand; 
Oh ! no—no, sever, they could not part with me, 
Mother thought I 
was the best in the land. 
When they were dying, Mr me they were praying, 
Heaven have mercy, I 
cannot help cry, 
I 
sent them both to their grave's broken-hearted, 
Now on the street a 
poor outcast I 
die. 
Chorus. 
Where, oh ! where— oh ! where is my Mary ? 
Long years have gone since I 
Darted from thee; 
Why did I 
leave you in grief and temptation, 
Death come to me and my mind will be free. 
Man go away and sit down to repentance, 
To see your poor Mary it's no use to crave, 
Iihe now roams in. heaven where God will protect her 
Her body lies deep in a 
lone pauper's grave.

dropping, 
Now Noah caught a 
lot of every kind of beasses, 
And all de shows dat's traveling, it beat dem all 
to pieces, 
He had a 
Morgan colt, and a 
lot of Jersey cattle, 
And drcve dein board de ark when de thunder 
it did rattle. 
Den such another fall of rain, it come so awful heavy, 
De river rise immediately, and busted in de lebby, 
lie people all was drownded out sept Noah, and 
de miters, 
And men he hired to run de boat, and me to mix 
the bitters. 
De ark it kept a 
moving, a 
sailing, and a 
sailing, 
De lion got his dander up and like to broke de paleing, 
lie serpents hissed, the panthers yelled, and 
with all their fussing, 
You couldn't hear the mate to save your life 
a 
bossing and a 
cussing.

THE ORIGIN OF THE BANJO. 
CONTINUED 
Now Ham, the oldest nig a 
runin' on de packet, 
Got lonesome in de barber shop, and couldn't 
stand the racket, 
For to amuse himself, he steemed some wood 
an' bent it, 
And soon he had a 
banjo made, de first dat 
was invented, 
He wet de leather, stretched it on, made bridge, 
and screws and apron, 
And fitted it a 
proper neck, it was very long 
and tapern, 
He took some tin and twisted him a 
thimble for 
to ring it, 
And then the mighty question was, how was he 
going to string it, 
De possum had as fine a 
tail, as sure as I'm a 
singing, 
The hair is long and good and strong just fit for 
banjo stringing, 
Dat nigger shaved dem off its short as wash-day 
dinner grasses, 
And sorted from de size, froin little E 
to basses. 
He strung her, tuned her, struck a 
jig, ' twas 
never mind de weather, 
She sounded like forty-leben bands a 
playing 
all together, 
;ionte went to rating, some to dancing, Noah 
ca!le(1 de figners, 
And Ham he sat and kn ,)cked de tune, de happiest 
of niggers. 
Now since dat time it's mighty strange, dere's 
• 
not de slightest showing, 
Of any hair at all upon de possum's tail a 
growing; 
And curious to dat nigger's ways his people 
never bossum, 
For wharever you find de nigger 6i:re's de nigger 
and de possum.

I 
am thinking of the day when but a 
little child, 
I 
wandered o'er the meadows to the hill, 
Where the sweet flowers grew, and forever 
growing wild, 
And the stream e'er flowed by the mill. 
But the old mill house has gone to decay, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
And the miller he lies sleeping where the 
gentle breezes blow 
And we played 'neath the turnpike gate. 
CHORUS. 
For the turnpike gate is the pride of my heart, 
I 
loved it and so did darling Kate, 
When she sits beside me now, there's a 
smile 
upon her brow, 
That reminds me of the turnpike gate. 
And the old school house has gone to decay, 
Where the schoolmaster heard us recite, 
And those happy, happy days have faded 
from our view, 
When our little hearts were filled with delight 
And when school was out we would wander to 
the spring 
Where I 
drew for you pictures on your slate; 
And those happy childhood days they'll come 
again no more, 
:When we played on the turnpike gate.

have traveled through life, I 
have seen many things, 
That surprised me in every form; 
I 
have been at the plow, I 
have been at the spade, 
'Till dark, and at sunrise in the morn. 
But at night I 
would go for some pleasure thro' town, 
I 
was,always for pleasure and joy; 
My mother would say when going away, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
CHORUS. 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy; 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
Be home early, to-night, my dear boy. 
One night I 
left home, and my poor mother was sick, 
In fever of torture and pain; 
She says, my dear boy, take the motto I 
give, 
I 
may not give it to you again. 
But when I 
returned from my 
night's fun and joy, 
I 
heard my poor mother was dead. 
'Twas then a 
cold chill through my body did run, 
When I 
thought of the last words she said. 
Cho. 
All yount• men that are here, take a 
word of advice, 
To your father and mother attend; 
For a 
good mother's love it must not be forgot, 
When she's gone you've lost your best friend, 
Don't spend all your money to gamble and drink, 
There are many things you can enjoy; 
Take the lesson I 
give'twas a 
mother's request, 
Keep good hours at night my dear boys.

Some beautiful 'memory hidden, 
That nestles alone in its resting Place,

'When life was gay and young, ' 
But now it is faded and withered and dead. 
Oh! beautiful songs unsung.

Beautiful songs unsung, 
Sorrowful songs unsung, 
Oh ! nestle alone in thy secret place, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsling. 
There are songs unsung, there are tales untold., 
Whose memory never can perish, 
For the hearts that know them are hearts of gold, 
And they keep them to love and to cherish, 
Tho' some are sombre, and sad and drear, 
To the lives of the saddened they're clunb, 
They are set in tears, and never can die, 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung. 
Chorus. 
There are songs unsung, there are words of love, 
That in kindness and truth were spoken, 
But now are the links of a 
glad wild dream, 
Cherished and loved yet broken. 
And, oh ! to the heart that knows them so well, 
They've the sweetest of thoughts among, 
For they seem like a 
life that was kiss'd by dcdatia. 
Oh! sorrowful songs unsung.

true-hearted boy from the green shores of Erin, 
That" Emerald" set in the sea, 
Where bounteous nature her best doth appear in; 
And choicest of gifts scatters free. 
Our mountains and valleys with produce abounding. 
Our rivers and lakes filled with life galore, 
Loveliest seenes on all sides there surrounding, 
The home of the shamrock, onld Ireland asthore.

Hurrah for that bright little spot on the ocean, 
Harmless' around it the rude billows roar; 
True Irish hearts love with fondest devotion, 
The home of the shamrock, ould Ireland asthore. 
Dear Grannuail thy daughters are peerless, 
Fair and as fresh as the morn, 
Ever in battle thy sons they are fearless,' 
Death do they hold but in scoan. 
Our hearts ever open to welcome a 
stranger, 
Those in distress never turned from the door, 
And for our country we'll brave every danger, 
The home of the shamrock, old Ireland asthore. 
Chorus. 
I 
love the bright green, and I'm proud, boys to wear it 
To it I'll ever be true, 
All loyal Irishmen that feeling share it, 
Deeply indeed as I 
do. 
Distance or climate that bond cannot seven, 
Firm in our hearts all the wide world o'e4„ 
The land of St. Patrick, forget it no never; 
The home of the shamrock, mild Ireland asthore.

They tell me to go over to England,

And there to bring out my new fashions, 
And eall them the high water pants,

Along with my first cousin Dan, 
We hired a 
seat down in the parquette, 
Behind the big man in the band. 
When a 
nosier came out with a 
banjo, 
He played up a

And he gave out a

'Bout O'Brien with his high.water pant..

strolled down the Bowery, 
Along with a

THE BLUE ALSATIAN,MOUNTAINSc 
BY CLABABELL. 
MUSIC BY STEPMIN ADAM 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Dwelt a 
nfhiden young and fair; 
Like the careless flowing fountains 
Were the ripples of her hair. 
Were the ripples of her hair; 
Angel mild, her eyes so winning. 
Inger bright her happy smile, 
When beneath the fountain spinning. 
A-de, A-de, Ado, 
Such songs will pass away; 
Tho' the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Many spring-times bloomed and passel. 
And the maiden by the fountains, 
Saw she lost her hopes at last, 
She lost her hopes at last. 
And she withered like a 
flower, 
That is waiting for the rain; 
She will never see the stranger, 
Where the fountains fall again. 
A-de, A-de, A-do, 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains 
Ever watch and wait alway, 
A-de, A- de, A-de. 
The years have passed away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway. 
By the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Came a 
stranger in the spring, 
And be lingered by the fountains, 
Just to hear the maiden sing, 
Just to hear the maiden sing; 
Just to whisper in the moonlight, 
Words the sweetest she had known, 
Just to charm away the hours, 
Till her heart was all his own. 
A- de, A-de, A-de, 
Such dreams must pass away, 
But the blue Alsatian mountains, 
Seem to watch and wait alway.

In a

Lived a 
damsel young and fair, 
Her papa wore the trousers 
When her mamma wasn't there. 
Maiden with a 
dimpled eyebrow, 
With a 
voice so young and'fair, 
Maiden with a 
yaller bull-dog, 
That followed her everywhere. 
Each day, each day, each day. 
Some family would move away, 
For that row of tenement houses 
Never seemed to please or pay. 
To that row of tenement houses 
Came a 
granger in the Spring, 
Just to talk of sheeps and cowses, 
And to hear that maiden sing. 
Just to hear that maiden sing, 
Oh! he spoke about his barnyard, 
Of his chickens and his hog; 
But she thought he was giving her taffy. 
So she called her yeller dog. 
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! 
That granger he ran away, 
But left the bosom of his tronses,

PAT MAY In FOKISH. 
CORRECT EDITION. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they will, 
Against the dear land of my birth, 
But I 
will maintain she always will be, 
The grandest old spot on the earth. 
Some say with a 
sneer, we are cowards at heart, 
Fit for nothing but drinking potheen, 
But I 
throw back the villainous lie in their teeth 
They're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat he may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat's got a 
temper that don't last very long, 
Tat is fond of jollity, as everybody knows, 
There never was a 
coward where the shamrock grows. 
If ever he weeps at the voice of distress, 
Don't blame him, his heart is too warm, 
His family over the ocean, perhaps, 
Must weather black poverty's storm. 
Don't sneer at his sorrows, or laugh at his tee" 
Assist, at least, if you can, 
Remember that Pat on many a 
held, 
Has proved that he is a 
true man. 
Chortle. 
Remember the Celts and the Saxons are bound, 
By the ties of pure brotherly love; 
Come teat him again, and you'll find him as true 
As the stars in the heavens above.. 
And always give honor where honor is due, 
Let hands join'd in friendship be seen, 
For he who despises a 
man for his name, 
' Is not fit for a 
country or queen.
