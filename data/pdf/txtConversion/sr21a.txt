The Roving Gambler/Erin's Green Shore
The Roving Gambler
AFS 1610 A1
I am a roving gambler, I gamble down in town, Whenever I meet a deck of cards, I lay my
money down. I have been in Washington, many more weeks than three, When I fell in love
with a pretty little gal, and she fell in love with me.
She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with her fan, She'd whispered low in her
mother's ears, “I love that gambling man.” “Oh doctor, oh dear doctor, why do you treat me
so, To leave your dear old mother, and with a gambler go.”
“Oh mother, oh dear mother, you know I love you well, But the love I have for this
gambling man no human tongue can tell. I've gambled down in Washington, I've gambled
down in Spain, I'm going down in Georgia to gamble my last game.”
“I hear the train a coming, a coming round the curve, A whistling and a blowing, it's
straining every nerve. Oh mother, my dear mother, I'll tell you if I can, If you ever see me
coming back, I'll be with gambling man.”
Erin's Green Shore
AFS 1610 A2
One evening so late as I rambled, On the banks of a clear purling stream. I sat down on
the bed of primroses, And so gently fell into a dream. I dreamed I beheld a fair female,Her
equal I ne'er saw before. As she sighed for the wrongs of her country, As she [strayed?]
along Erin's green shore.

I quickly addressed this fair female, “My jewel, come tell me your name. For in this country
I know you're a stranger, Or I would not have asked you the same.” She resembled the
goddess of liberty, And of freedom, the mantle she wore. As she sighed for the wrongs of
her country, As she strayed along Erin's green shore.
“I know you're a true son of [Grannu?], And my secrets to you I'll unfold. For here in the
midst of all dangers, Not knowing my friends from my foes. I'm the daughter of Daniel
O'Connell, And from England I lately came o'er. I've come to awaken my brethren, That
slumber on Erin's green shore.”
Her eyes were like two sparkling diamonds, As the stars of a clear frosty night. Her cheeks
were two blooming roses, And her teeth of the ivory so white. She resembled the goddess
of freedom, And green was the mantle she wore. Bound round with the shamrock and
roses, That grew along Erin's green shore.
