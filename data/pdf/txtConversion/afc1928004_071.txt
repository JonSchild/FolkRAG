LITTLE MAGGIE MAY. 
The Spring had come, the flowers in bloom, 
The birds sung out their lay ; 
Down by it little running brook, 
I 
first, saw Maggi e May : 
She had a 
roguish jet-black eye, 
Was singing all the day : 
And how I 
loved her ! none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
CI Olt 
S : 
My little witching Maggie, 
Maggie sin.inir all the day. 
Oh ! how I 
love her ! none can tell, 
My little Maggie May. 
Though years rolled on. yet still I 
loved 
With heart so light and gay, 
And never will this heart deceive 
My own dear Maggie May. 
When others .thought that life was gone 
And death would take away, 
Still by my side did linger one. 
And that was Maggie May. 
My little witching, &c. 
May Heaven protect me for her &Ike: 
I 
pray, both night and day, 
That I 
ore long may call her mine, 
My own dear Maggie May. 
For, she is all the world to me, 
Althoul...,11 I'm far away : 
I 
oftimes think of the running brook, 
And my little Maggie May. 
My little witching, ST.e.

THOU BAST LEARNED TO LOVE ANOTHER. 
Thou bast learned to lore another— 
Thou bast broken every vow— 
We have parted from each other, 
And my heart is lonely now. 
I 
have taught my looks to shun thee, 
When coldly we have met, 
For another's smile hath won thee, 
And thy voice I 
must forget, 
Oh I 
is it well to sever 
This heart from thine for ever, 
Can I 
forget thee ? never! 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met in scenes of pleasure, 
We have met in halls of 'Aide, 
I 
have seen thy new found treasure, 
And I've g:Ized upon thy bride. 
Thy looks were stern and altered— 
Thy words ran cold and high, 
How my traitor courage faltered, 
When I 
dared to meet thine eye. 
Would I 
ne'er had met thee, 
Fahi, fain, would I 
forget thee, 
'There folly to regret thee; 
Farewell, farewell for ever. 
We have met and and we have parted, 
Yet I 
uttered scarce a 
word, 
Like a 
guilty tliirg I 
started, 
When thy well known voice I 
heard. 
I 
have marked the timid lus:re, 
Of thy downcast happy eye, 
I 
have seen thee gilze upon her, 
Forgetting I 
was nigh. 
Oh, woman's love may grieve her, 
And woman's pride will leave her, 
Life is fled when love deceives her, 
Farewell, farewell for ever.

KIND TO DARLING SISTER NELL. 
Be kind to darling sister Nell, good lady, when I'm dead ; 
Let not a 
shade of sorrow han, , above her infant head; 
Her tender heart will yearn for love, her soul with grief may 
stir; 
But trea t 
her gently as thine own, be very kind to her 
0.1! treat her g-euLly as thy own, he very kind to her. 
cnouus. 
Good lady, hear an orphan's prayer, and treat her gently as 
thine own ; 
For, how can darling sister Nell live in this cold world alone ? 
How sadly would she tread along the ragged path of years, 
Without a 
father's cheering voice to soothe her childish fears, 
Without a 
mother's faithful care and watchful eyes of love, 
To guide her in the path of truth, and to the home above ? — 
To guide her in the path of love and to the home above ? 
Good lady, &c. 
De kind to darling sister Nell : oh ! tell me, ere I 
go: 
Will ever that poor trusting heart a 
pang of anguish know ? 
And will her orphan tears of grief for pity plead in vain ? 
And will she mourn that we are gone, while she must here 
rein am n ? 
And will she mourn that we are gone, while she must here 
remain ? 
Good lady, &c.

I'D OFFER THEE THIS HAND OF MINE. 
Music by L. Thayer Chadwick. 
I'd offer thee this hand. of mine, 
If I 
could love thee less, 
But hearts as warm and pure as thine 
Should never know distress ; 
My fortune is too hard for thee, 
'Tvould chill thy dearest joy,, 
I'd rather weep to see thee free, 
Than win thee to destroy. 
I'd offer thee, &c. 
leave thee to thy happiness, 
As one too dear to love, 
As one I 
think of but to bless, 
As wretchedly I 
rove; 
But oh, when sorrow's cup I 
drink, 
All bitter though it he, 
how sweet ' t' N 
ill he for me to think, 
It holds no drop for thee. 
I'd offer thee, &e. 
And now my dreams are sadly o'er, 
Fate bids them all depart, 
And I 
must leave my native shore, 
In brokenwss of heart; 
Then oh, dear one, when far from thee, 
ne'er know joy again, 
I 
would not that one thought of me 
Should give thy bosom pain. 
I'd offer thee, &e. 
HAVE NO XOTHER NOW. 
I've no mother now, I'm weeping— 
She has left me here alone.; 
She beneath the sod is sleepIng— 
Now, there is no joy at home. 
Tears of sorrow long have started, 
her briolit smile no more I'll see— 
And the loved ones, too, have parted; 
Where, oh, where is joy for me ?

LOVE'S YOUNG DREAM. 
Oh 1 
the days are gone, when Beauty bright 
My in7art's chain wove ; 
When my dream of life, from morn till night, 
Was love, still love. 
New hope may bloom, 
And days may come, 
Of milder, calmer beam, 
But there's nothing half so sweet in lila 
As love's young dream! 
No, there's nothing half so sweet in life' 
As love's young dream. 
Tho' the bald to purer fame may soar, 
Wheit wild youth's past, 
Tho' he win the wise, who frown'd before, 
To smile at last; 
He'll never meet 
A 
joy so sweet, 
In all his noon of fame, 
As when first be sung to woman's eal.,. 
His soul-felt flame. 
And, at every close, she blusli'd to hear 
The one lov'd name. 
Oh! that hallow'd form is ne'er forgot. 
'Which first love trac'd; 
Still it lingering haunts the greenest spot 
On mem'ry's waste. 
'Twas odor fled 
As soon as shed; 
'Twas morning's winged dream 
'Twas a 
light that ne'er can shine again 
On life's dull stream ! 
.0h 'twas Het that ne'er can shine again 
Ota life's dull stream! 
11A.RIE: I HEAR AN ANGEL SING. 
Hark! I 
hear an angel sing_ 
Angels now are on the wing; 
And their voices, singing clear, 
Tell us that the spring is near. 
n'est thou hear them, gentle one ? 
Dost thou see the glorious sun 
Rising higher in the sky, 
As each day, as each day it passes by ? 
CHORUS. 
Hark! I 
hear an angel sing_ 
Angels now are on the win , • 
And their voices, singing clear, 
Tell us that the spring is near. 
;rust beyond yon cliff of snow, 
silver rivers brightly flow; 
Smiling woods and fields are seen, 
Mantled in a 
robe of green. 
Birds, and bees, and brooks and flowers, 
Tell us all of vernal hours. 
There the birds are weaving lays 
:For the happy, happy spring-time days. 
Bark! I 
hear, &a. 
Look! oh, look! the southern sky 
Mirrors flowers of every dye, 
Children, tripping o'er the plain ; 
Spring is coming back again— 
Spring is coming I 
shouts of glee: 
Singing birds on bush and tree, 
And the bees; their merry hums; 
For the spring- time comes, it comes, it comes! 
Hark! I

Oh! if I 
had some one who'd love me, 
My troubles, my trials who'd share, 
One to lave and a 
little reprove me, 
And lessen my heart of its care, 
Oh ! if I 
had soma one who'd love me, 
To cherish and comfort me too, 
The bright shining stars then above me 
Would prove a 
great happiness too. 
For 'tis love that's the bliss of creation, 
Only love that's in nature sublime, 
To the highest or lowly of station, 
Love to all is a 
feeling divine.

Oh! if I

My troubles, my trials who'd share, 
One to love and little reprove me, 
And lessen my heart of its care. 
Oh! if I 
had some one who'd love me, 
Then nature more lovely would beam, 
The flowerets' sweet perfume then round me, 
Would hail and gladden the scene. 
Oh! if I'd some one who'd love me, 
Whose heart and whose soul could be mine, 
Then I'd praise the blest p 
iwers above me, 
For my life thus made truly divine, 
For ' tis love that's the bliss of creation.

SHE NEVER BLAM D HIM, NEVER. 
She never blam'd him, never •, 
But received him when he came, 
With a 
welcome kind as ever, 
And she tried to look the same— 
But vainly she dissembled, 
For whene'er she tried to smile 
A tear unbidden trembled 
In her blue eye all the while. 
She knew that she was dying, 
And she dreaded not her doom; 
She never thought of sighing, 
O'er her beauty's blighted bloom— 
She knew her cheek was alter'd, 
And she knew her eye was dim; 
But her sweet voice only faulter'd 
When she spoke of losing him. 
'Tis true that he had lur'd her. 
From the isle where she was born, 
'Tis true he had inued her, 
To the cold world's cruel scorn— 
But yet she never blani'd him 
For the anguish she had known; 
And tho' she sel loin mun'd 
Yet she thougut of him alone. 
She sigh'd when he caress'd her, 
For she knew that the must part ; 
She spoke not when he pres'd her, 
To his young and panting heart— 
The banners wav'd around her, 
And she heard the bugle's sound ; 
They pass'd and strangers found her 
Cold and lifeless on the ground. 
NO ONE TO LOVE. 
No one to love, none to caress, 
,aining alone through this world's wilderness; 
Sad is my heart, joy is unknown; 
For, in my sorrow, I'm weeping alone, 
No gentle voice, no tender smile 
Makes me rejoice, or cares beguile. 
CHORUS. 
No one to love, none to caress, 
Roaming alone through this world's wilderness, 
Sad is my heart, joy is unknown; 
For, in my sorrow, I'm weeping alone. 
In dreams alone, loved ones I 
see, 
And well-known voices then whisper to me: 
Sighing I 
wake, waking I 
weep;

MEETING OF THE WATERS. 
There 'is not in the wide world a 
valley so sweet 
As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet 
f, 
0.1 I the last ray of feeling and life must depart, 
Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my heart. 
Yet it was not that nature had shed o'er the scene 
Her purest of crystal and br,glitest ot green ; 
'Twos not the soft magic of streamlet or hill— 
Oh ! no— it was something more exquisite still. 
'Twas that friends the beloved of my bosom were near, 
Who made every dear scene of enchantment more dear, 
And who felt how the best charms of nature improve, 
When we see them reflected from looks that we love. 
Sweet vale of Avoca! how calm could I 
rest 
In thy bosom of shade, with the friends I 
love best, 
Where the storms that we feel iu this cold world should cease, 
And our hearts, like thy waters, be mingled in peace. 
REMEMBER THEE. 
Remember thee! yes, while there's life in this heart, 
It shall never forget thee, all lorn as thou art ; 
More dear in thy sorrow, thy gloom, and thy showers, 
Than the rest of the world in their sunniest hours. 
Wert thou all that I 
wish thee,— great, glorious, and free—. 
First flower of the earth and first gem of the sea,— 
I 
might hail thee with prouder, with happier brow. 
But, oh ! could I 
love thee more deeply than now ? 
No, thy chains as they rankle, thy blood as it runs, 
But make thee more painfully dear to thy sons— 
Whose hearts, like the young of the desert-bird's nest, 
Drink love in each life-drop that flows from thy breast!

Where the wind-harps will whisper o'er the blest, 
Like the song of some Angel ill our dream.

Let her sleep, let her sleep, 
'Let her sleep 'neath the willow by the stream:

For, the Spring- time is coming with its flowers, 
When the wild-rose will blosom o'er her breast, 
As the song- birds will while away the hours.

Let the dead and the beautiful rest, 
Where the long drooping willow branches wave; 
While the moon, slowly sinking in the West, 
Leaves the stars keeping vigils o'er hcr grave.

WAITING FOR A BROADWAY STAGE. 
As up Broadway I 
strolled, one day, 
Ta see I 
t,a stj les pass by, 
A 
pretty iittle girl I 
very soon met, 
And she had such a 
roguish eye. 
Tier littie short skirts in points hung down, 
tha , style's all the rage 
She was 'looking up and down with a 
pretty little frown, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage, oh 
CHORUS. 
She was just about the girl that's all the rage; 
Sweet sixteen was just her age 
I 
met her on the corner 
it was there that first I 
saw her, 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage. 
She saw that I 
was looking at her, 
When a 
sweet littie smile, like a 
beam, 
Just played round her face and, with such ease and grace 
Why like a 
little Angel she did seem. 
Bu: I 
kept getting like any one in fear, 
for, my he-rt felt like a 
bird that's in a 
cage: 
How I 
wished I'd never seen that handsome little queen 
Waiting for a 
Broadway-stage oh I 
She was just, tke. 
But as the ice

As the stage, tha• she required, soon came oy, 
When she said in tones s 
D sweet perhaps some time we'll

As up the steps her little form aid fly 
But I 
never sine have seen her, so I 
wander in despair, 
For, it seems tha.. since she left me -twas an age, 
But I 
never shad forget that little girl I 
met,

KATIE'S SECRET. 
The sunlight is beautiful, Mother, 
And sweetly the flowers bloom to-day, 
And birds, in the branches of hawthorn, 
Are caroling ever so gay 
And down by the rock in the meadow. 
The rill ripples by with a 
song; 
And, Mother, I, too, have been singing, 
The merriest all the day long. 
Last night, I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
Last night, I 
was weeping alone: 
The world was so dark and so dreary, 
My heart it grew as heavy as stone; 
I 
thought of the lonely and loveless, 
All lonely and loveless was I: 
I 
scarcely could tell why it was, Mother, 
• 
But, oh ! I 
was wishing to die. 
Last night, I 
was weeping, dear Mother, 
But Willie came down by the gate, 
And whispered: 
Come out in the moonlight, 
I've something to say to you, Kate. 
Oh I 
Mother, to him I 
am dearer 
Than all in the wide world beside; 
IIe told me so, out in the moonlight, 
And called me his darling, his bride. 
So now I 
will gather my roses, 
And twine in my long, braided hair. • 
Then Willie will come in the evening, 
And smile when he sees me so fair. 
And out, in the moonli edit, we'll wander, 
Way down by the old hawthorn-tree 
Oh! Mother, I 
wonder if any 
Were ever so happy as we.

Fair, fair, and golden hair, 
Sang a 
lone mother while weeping ; 
Fair, fair, and gulden hair, 
Under the willow she's sleeping. 
Under the willow no songs are heard, 
Near where my darling lies dreamine• ; 
Naught but the voice of tqillie far-off bi d, 
Where life and its pleasures are beaming. 
Fair, fair, 
Under the willow, by night and day, 
Sorrowing ever I 
ponder; 
Free from its shadowy, gloomy ray, 
Ah! never again can she wander. 
Fair, fair, &e. 
Under the willow I 
breathe a 
prayer, 
Longing to linger for ever 
Near to my angel with 2olden hair, 
In lands where there's sorrowing never.

Shell we never more behold thee, 
Never hear thy winning voice again,

When the wild flowers are scattered o'er the plain 
We have roamed and loved ' neath the bowers, 
When thy downy cheeks were in bloom ; 
Now I 
stand alone '
midst the flowers, 
While they mingle their perfumes o'er thy tomb. 
Shall we never more, &c.

BONNY ELOISE, THE BELLE OF THE MOHAWK 
VALE. 
Sweet is the vale where the Mohawk gently glides, 
On the clear winding way to the sea, 
And dearer than all storied streams on earth besides, 
Is this bright rolling river to me. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Bale of the Mohawk Vale. 
Oh, sweet are the scenes of my boyhood's sunny hour, 
That bespangle the gay valley o'er, 
And dear are the friends seen thro' memory's fond tears, 
That have lived in the blest days of yore. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue-eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Belle of the Mohawk Vale. 
Oh, sweet are the moments when dream'n7 I 
roam, 
Through my loved haunts now mossy and grey, 
And dearer than all is my childhood's hal!owed hem°, 
That is crumbling now slowly away. 
But sweeter, dearer, yes, dearer far than these, 
Who charms when others all fail, 
Is blue-eyed bonny Eloise, 
The Belle of the Mohawk Vale.

LOVE AMONG THE ROSES. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by W. H. DELEHANTY. 
Music by E. N. CATLIN. 
IL was on one Summer's evening, 
In the merry month of June; 
I 
beheld a 
damsel sitting 
'Mid flowers' sweet perfume. 
She had a 
novel, reading:, 
Just as I 
was passing by, 
And as she turned another page, 
I 
saw the brightest eye ; 
A bewitching smile was on her face. 
As charming as the posies: 
I 
felt the smart of Cupid's dart: 
'Twas love among the roses. 
MORI:S.—Now, I 
hate to tell, but then I 
must; 
Within her heart I 
place my trust; 
She was sitting in the garden, 
Where the little butterfly reposes: 
And how we met, I'll ne'er forget, 
'Tv,-as love among the roses. 
I 
passed her house next evening, 
The clock had just struck eight, 
And I 
saw my future happiness; 
She was standing by the garden-gate. 
She smiled as I 
approached her, 
And I 
begged her to excuse; 
May I 
view those pretty flowers 
She murmured: If you choose. 
I 
spoke about the violets, 
Then finally made proposes: 
Thro' the garden we walked, of happiness talked; 
'Twas love among the roses. 
Now, I 
hate to tell, 
I 
confess I 
love Matilda; 
Matilda, that's her name; 
And there is a 
charm about her, 
Which I 
never can explain. 
She dresses up to fashion, 
To her style there is no end, - 
And, of course, she must look dashing; 
For, she wears a 
Grecian Bend. 
But she's left her home, and where she's gone, 
Most every one supposes; 
For, as dear as life is may little wife; 
'Twas love among the roses. - 
Now, I 
hate to tell, cte.

THE WIDOW, 
IN THE COTTAGE BY THE SEA-SIDE 
Just one year ago to-day, love, 
I 
became your happy bride, 
Changed a 
mansion for a 
cottage, 
To dwell by the river side ; 
You told me I'd be happy, 
But no happiness I 
For to-night I 
am a

In the cottage by the sea.

Alone, all alone by the sea- side he left me 
And no other's bride I'll be; 
For in bridal flow' is he deck'd me, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
From my cottage by the sea-side, 
I 
can see my mansion home, 
I 
can see those hills and valleys, 
Where with pleasure I 
have roamed ; 
The last time that I 
met him, 
Oh, how happy then were we, 
But to-night I 
am a 
widow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
Alone, all alone, & c. 
Oh! my poor and aged father, 
How in sorrow he would wail, 
And my poor and aged mother, 
How in tears her eyes would swell, 
And may poor and enly brother, 
Oh, how he would weep for me, 
If he only knew his sister 
Was a 
widow by the sea. 
Alone, all alone, &c. 
I 
am going far away,

With this our darkey band, 
To travel all this wide world over ; 
And when I

I 
will settle down to rest, 
Away down in my Old Cabin Home. 
Here is my Old Cabin Home, (ie. 
When old age comes on, 
And my hair is turning gray

And o'er the moor that's sedgy ; 
With heavy thoughts may mind is 
Since I

Whene'er I 
turn to view the place, 
The tears cloth fall and blind me, 
When I 
think on the charming grace 
Of the girl I 
left behind me. 
The hours I 
remember well, 
When next to see cloth move me, 
The burning flames my heart cloth tell, 
Since first she own'd she lov'd me. 
In search of some one fair and gay, 
Several cloth remind me ; 
I 
know my darling loves me well, 
Though I 
left her behind me. 
The bees shall lavish, make no store, 
And the dove become a 
ranger 
The fallen water cease to roar, 
Before I'll ever change her. 
Each mutual promise faithfully made, 
By her whom tears cloth blind me, 
And bless the hours I 
pass away 
With the girl I 
left behind me. 
My mind her image full retains, 
Whether asleep or waking ; 
I 
hope to see my jewel again, 
For her my heart is breaking. 
But if ever I 
chance to go that way, 
And that she has not resign'd me, 
I'll reconcile my mind and stay 
With the girl I 
left behind me.

The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
The river murmured to the sea: 
The dew-
drops kissed the blushing rosa, 
rho gentle winds did sigh; 
One word broke nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was: Good-bye! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! tell me that you love me yet, 
For, oh! the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again! 
We parted by the river-side: 
A 
tear-drop trembled on your cheek, 
In vain to tell my love I 
tried, 
My heart was sad, I 
could not speak. 
I 
promised that I 
would be true 
So long as I 
would live; 
The parting kiss I 
gave to you, 
Was all I 
had to give. 
Oh! tell me, &a. 
We 
parted by the river-side: 
And I 
have roamed a 
distant clime, 
My heart has not forgot its pride; 
For, I 
have loved you all the time. 
And I 
am faithful to you still, 
While I 
believe you true; 
Afar or near, let come what will, 
I'll love you, you, only you. 
Oh I 
tell me, eice.

I'd a 
dream to-night as I 
fell asleep— 
Oh ! the touching sight makes me still to weep— 
Of my little lad, gone to make me sad; 
Aye, the child I 
had, but was not to keep. 
Mother, mother, mother, never mourn. 
Mother, mother, mother, never mourn. 
AS 
in heaven high I 
my child did seek, 
There in train came by children Mir and meek; 
Each in lily white, with a 
lamp a- light ; 
Each was clear to sight, but they did not speak. 
Mother, mother. mother, never mourn, 
Mother, mother, mother, never mourn. 
Then, a 
little sad, came my child in turn, 
But the lamp he had, oh ! it did not burn
Re ; 
to clear my doubt, said, half turned about, 
" 
Your tears put it out; Mother, mother, never mourn."

ON THE BEACH AT LONG B1\4
CIa. 
As 
sung by the GREAT LiliGARD. 
On the Beach at Long Branch, one fine Summer's day, 
I 
had a 
novel reading to pass the time away, 
And so interested was I 
in the plot— 
A Gent stood there bedside me—still I 
saw him net — 
Till, at last, by chance, my eyelids I 
did raise--
I 
found him on me looking with enraptured. gaze— 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, handsome Grecian nose, 
Teeth of pearly whiteness—quite the pink of beaux. 
• 
CffORO'S. 
eTwas on the beach at Long Branch, one fine Summer's day, 
I 
met this handsome man who stole my heart away; 
Now I 
feel so happy as blissful moments glide, 
The day is quickly coming when I 
shall be his bride! 
As like one awaking from some happy dream, 
We glances did exchange—his eyes with love did beam— 
Ere much time was over, we began to chat— 
And hours passed away—still he beside me sat— 
And with ways so winning he did love impart— 
My spirits rose as high as the early morning lark. 
He told me that he loved me, vowed that all his life 
Would be to him worthless, unless I'd be his wife. 
'Twas on the beach, &e. 
He said that if I'd marry, all troubles we would drown, 
And live in blissful ignorance of all the cares of Town. 
With soft persuasive power lie told me of his love, 
Vowing to be true, by all the Powers above! 
He asked me if I'd marry, pressed me then to say— 
Till, to his wishes yielding, I 
named the nappy day. 
Ile said his cup of bliss was filled quite to the brim,-
He'd live alone for me, and I 
alone for him! 
Spoken.—And I 
can assure you, Ladies and Gentlemen, he

ent moment I've no Otias0 to regret that

THEY TOLD ME NOT TO LOVE HILT. 
They told me not to love him, 
They said that he would prove 
Unworthy of s) rich a 
gem 
As woman's priceless love. 
But I 
believed them not, oh ! no, 
I 
knew it could not be, 
That one so false as they thought 'tin/ 
Could be so dear to me. 
They told me not to love him, 
They said he was not true, 
And bade me have a 
care, lest I 
Should do what I 
might rue; 
At first I 
scorned their warning— for 
I 
could not think that he 
Concealed beneath so fair a 
brow 
A heart of perfidy. 
But they f 
rced me to discard him! 
Yet I 
could not cease to : ove, 
For our mutual vows recorded were 
By angel hands above. 
He left his boyhood's home, and sought 
Forgetfulness afar; 
But memory stung him—and he fought, 
And fell in glorious war. 
They told me to discard him, 
They said he meant me ill, 
They darkly spoke of friends that lure, 
And smile, and kiss, and—kill. 
I 
all unheeding heard them—for 
I 
knew it could not be, 
That one so false as they thought him 
Could be so dear to me. 
He dwells in H-aven, now, while I 
Am doomed to this dull earth: 
Oh! how my sad soul longs to break 
Away, and wander forth. 
From star to star its course would be, 
Unresting it would go, 
Till we united were above, 
Who 
severed were below.

KITTY WELLS. 
You ask what makes this darkie weep, 
Why he like others am not gay, 
What causes the tear to flow down his cheek, 
From early morn till close of day. 
My story, darkies, you shall hear, 
For in my memory fresh it dwells, 
It will cause you all to drop a 
tear 
On the grave of my sweet Kitty Wells. 
CTIORIIS. 
While the birds were singing in the morning, 
And the myrtle and the ivy were in bloom, 
And the sun on the hill was a 
dawning, 
It was then we laid her in the tomb: 
I 
never shall forget the day, 
That we together roamed the dells, 
I 
kissed her cheek, and named the day 
That I 
should marry Kitty Wells. 
But death came in my cabin door, 
And took from me my joy and pride, 
And when I 
found she was no more, 
I 
laid my banjo down and cried. 
While the birds, &c. 
I 
often wish that I 
was dead, 
And laid beside her in the tomb. 
The sorrow that bows down my head 
Is silent in the midnight gloom. 
The spring time has no charm for me, 
Though flowers are bloomin,; in the dells, 
For that bright form I 
do not see, 
'Tis the form of my sweet Kitty 1V2115.

Childhood's days now pass before me. 
Forms and scenes of long ago; 
Like a

Calm and bright as evening's glow; 
Days that knew no shade of sorrow, 
When my young heart, pure and free, 
Joyful hailed each coming morrow, 
In the cottage by the sea. 
CHORUS. 
In the cottage by the sea, 
In the cottage by the sea, 
Joyful hailed each coming morrow.

Fancy sees the rose-trees twining 
Round the old and rustic door, 
And, below, the white beach shining,

I'M LONELY TO-NIGHT. 
Words and Music by G. W. II. GRIFFON. 
I 
am lonely to-night, in my sad little chamber, 
While the stars sweetly shine upon all I 
hold dear : 
They are gone from their home with the bold fearless ranger, 
There's a 
void in my heart ; for, they arc not here. 
Oh! why did they leave me alone and deserted, 
To risk their dear lives on the blood-sprinkled plain! 
Should they never return, this poor heart will soon wither, 
And never know joy or comfort again. 
cnouus. 
I 
am lonely to-night, I 
am lonely to-night, 
While the stars sweetly shine upon 
hold dear I 
I 
am lonely, I 
am lonely to-night. 
I 
am lonely to-night, but ere Spring-birds shall warble 
Their matinal song in the wild forest-tree, 
And the bright limpid brook with sweet music shall babble. 
My heart will grow li:rliter, while thinking of thee ! 
Then fleet by dull hours, and bring back the loved ones, 
Who parted from frixj s 
with a 
tear moistened eye; 
For, then, this sad heart will no longer be lonely, 
But joyous and happy as the mild azure sky. 
I 
am lonely, &e, 
HOME SWEET HOME. 
'Mid pleasures and palaces, though we may roam, 
Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home; 
A charm from the skies, seems to hallow us there, 
Which, seek through the world, is nc'er met with elswhere 
home, home, sweet, sweet home, 
There's no place like home. Repeat. 
I 
gaze on the moon, as I 
trace the drear wild, 
And feel that my parent now thinks of her ; 
She looks on that moon from her own cottage door, 
Through woodbines whose fragrance shall cheer rile no more, 
Home, home, sweet, sweet home, &c. 
An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain, 
0, give me my lowly, thatched cottage again; 
The birds singing gaily that came at my call, 
Give me them with the peace of mind, dearer than all.

Kiss me, mother, kiss your darling, 
Lean my head upon your breast, 
Fold yonr loving arms around me,

Scenes of life are swiftly fading, 
Brighter seems the other shore:

And that I

In the soldier's honored grave.

SWINGING IN THE LANE, 
Words and Music by CHARLES CARROL SAWYER. • 
How oft we talked of childhood's joys, 
Of tricks we used to play 
'Upon each other, while at school 
To pass the time away ! 
But, oh ! how often have I 
longed 
For those bright days again, 
When little rosy Nell and. I 
Went swinging in the lane I

But yet I'd give the world to be 
With rosy Nell again, 
I 
never, never will forgot 
Our swinging in the lane 
The boys and girls would often go 
A- fishing in the brooks, 
With spools of thread for fishing-lines, 
And bonded pins for hooks; 
They, sometimes, wished me with them, but 
They, always, wished in vain ; 
I'd rather be with rosy Nell, 
A-swinging in the lane. 
But yet Pa, &c. 
But soon a 
cloud, of sorrow came— 
A strange young man, from town, 
Was introduced to rosy Nell 
By Aunt Jernima Brown. 
She stayed away from school next day— 
The truth to me was plain— 
She'd gone with that there city chap, 
A-swinging in the lane 1 
But yet I'd, &e. 
Now all young men with tender hearts, 
Pray take advice from me: 
Don't be so quick to fall in love 
With every girl you see; 
For, if you do, you soon will find. 
You've only loved in vain; 
She'll go off with some other chap, 
A-swinging in the lane I

In the meadows a-making hay,

Far away to the golden west,

A mother took leave of her boy that day;

could hear her sob and cry, 
As I 
followed her back to her dreary home, 
But never a

But you see that they needn't come wooing to me ;

As she spoke of her lad who was far away: 
For she guessed. that I 
loved him, too ; 
She turned. to me fondly, and whispered low 
I 
was worthy her sailor-boy.

In the lawn by the elders shaded,

Words by DEXTER SMITH.. 
Music by H ENRY TUCKER. 
When the day was growing late, Willie met me at the gate, 
Ere the stars Caine to twinkle in the sky, 
Ere the nightiugale was heard, or the evening zephyrs stirred, 
Where the brook sang sweet songs as it ran by. 
But no song snswe , t 
to me, as my Willie's voice can be, 
When he whispers, " Meet me, Josie, at the gate." 
So I 
gladly met him there, where the roses bloomed so fair, 
When the day was 
so quickly growitk: hate. 
CHORUS. 
There's no song so sweet to me, as my Willie's voice can be, 
When he says, " Meet me, Josie, at the gate," 
So I 
gladly met him there, where the roses bloomed so fair, 
When tho day was so quickly growing late. 
Willie now is far away, and alone I 
often stray, 
To the gate where we pirted, that sweet hour, 
Yet I 
know his heart istrue. as the sunshine and tlae dew, 
To the petals of the fragrant summer flower. 
As he whispered in my ear, something sweet for me to bear, 
I 
was glad I 
was asked his brid , to be, 
Though I 
did not whisper " yea," still I 
did not answer " nay," 
For my thoughts in my face he sure could see. 
There's no sang, 80.

SHE DANCED LIRE A FAIRY. 
relate to you, public, the source of my woes: 
They're worse than hard blows, for, nobody knows, 
When is ith love your yQuill2." heart like a 
cauliflower grows, 
And the girl don't care two-pence for you. 
The case it is mine, I'm sorry to say, 
Through a ( ri,d when I 
think, my heart heaves, 
Whom I 
taught to dance in an exquisite way, 
And sing twice as well as Sims Reeves. 
CHORUS. 
She danced like a 
fairy, and sang like a 
bird, 
She did, on my word ; but, rather absurd, 
She doated on Charley, a 
man that you've heard, 
And so she skedaddled from me. 
Then, her father sold. goods on a 
second hand plan, 
he'd, when he began, no meat in the pan, 
But, from little to big, he 1),,came a 
great man, 
And he, now, has a 
hand-me-down shop. 
Coats, trousers and waistcoats, for him she would turn, 
And convert the old shirts into new, 
When business was done, then her step she would learn, 
And dance in a 
suit of light blue. [She danced, &:13 
The first time that I 
met her, 'twas at her Pa's shop; 
1 
outside did stop, then inside did pop, 
Half-a-sovereign bright in her little palm drop, 
Said: Have you got a 
suit to fit me ? 
She showed an assortment, hats, coats, boots as well, 
And, at last, I 
chose these like a 
man; 
She said I 
looked handsome, in love with me fell, 
From that time our courtship began. [She danced, (K7c 
On each Saturday-night, I 
my clothes would redeem, 
It's just like a 
dream, so strange does it seem, 
Just to think we, on Sundays, looked like King and Queen, 
When from" Uncle's" I'd borrowed my clothes. 
He'd lend me my chesterfield, just for the day, 
And, on Mondays, I'd take him them back, 
The money spent on her, bat to my dismay, 
One morning she gave mo the sack. [She danced, & c. 
But sweet Charley, got clothes from the same shop ag me, 
And, soon, I 
could see, with me 'twas U P. 
He made friends with her father, and with them took tea, 
And he sang th,,m . his last comic songs. 
His soft winning ways her affections did win, 
And then he took her feelings by storm, 
Ile then brought her out, and he thus took me in, 
For with him she now does perform. [She danced, Szc.

POOR LITTLE LAURA. 
Words by G EO. COOPER. 
Music by HENRY TUCKER. 
Under the gas-light, while the snow falls, 
And the chill night- wind wearily calls : 
When the lone beggar creeps to his shed, 
And the rich miser lies in his bed: 
Hear little Laura making her moan, 
Poor little orphan-child weeping alone: 
" 
Pity me, stranger, help me, I 
pray— 
Father and mother have sent me away 1" 
*Under the gas-light, Laura's asleep, 
While the snow's mantle round her cloth creep: 
Louder the night-wind—no help is near, 
No one to calm her, no one to cheer— 
But, in her dreaming, wanders she nolv 
Where the bright Angels will smooth her fair brow, 
Well: for, the life-tide's ebbing so fast, 
All earthly suffering soon will be past. 
Under the gas-light, rescue is near 
Poor little Laura hush every fear! 
kind hands have borne thee, far from the storm,

Dearer, far dearer love shall be thine, 
Through tears, the Future so brightly will shine, 
Now, amon≤-, strangers, rest thy worn feet,

WILLIE, WE HAVE MISSED YOU. 
Words and Music by STEPHEN C. 
FOSTER. 
Oh I 
Willie, is it you, dear, safe, safe at home ? 
They did not tell me ,true, dear; they said you would not 
come. 
I 
heard you a.t the gate, and it made my heart rejoice; 
For, I knew that welcome footstep, and that familiar 
voice, 
Making music on my ear in the lonely midnight gloom. 
Oh I 
Willie, we have missed you—welcome, welcome home l 
'We've longed to see you nightly, but this night of all, 
The fire was blazing brightly, and lights were in the hall; 
The little ones were up till 'twas ten o'clock and past, 
Then their eyes began to twinkle, and they've gone to sleep 
at last 
But they listened for your voice till they thought you'd 
never come, 
Oh I 
Willie we have missed you—welcome, welcome home. 
The days were sad without you, the nights were long and 
drear, 
My dreams have been about you, oh 
welcome, Willie 
dear; 
Last night, I 
wept and watched, by the moonlight's cheerless 
ray, 
Till I 
thought I 
heard your footstep, then I 
wiped my tears 
away; 
But my heart grew sad again, when I 
found you had not 
come; 
Oh! Willie, we have missed you—welcome, welcome home. 
The earth has many treasures rare, 
In gems and golden ore ; 
My heart hath one more precious far— 
The ring my mother wore, 
I 
saw it first, when I, a 
child, 
Was playing by her side ; 
She told me then, ' twas father's gift, 
When she became his bride. . 
I 
saw it oft in sorrow's hours, 
Which marked the after years, 
When shining on the soft, white hand, 
That wiped away my tears, 
And oh! I 
saw it once again, 
When, on her dying bed, 
She lifted up her hand in prayer 
And laid it on my head. 
Beside that bed, where fell my tears, 
The ring to me was given; 
She placed it on my hand, and said: 
" 
We'll meet again in heaven !" 
I 
kissed the cheek I 
oft had pressed. 
From which the rose had fled : 
And bowed with grief, stood motherless, 
Alone, beside the dead. 
Among the blest in realms above, 
Where sorrows are unknown, 
Oh ! may I 
meet my mother dear, 
No more to weep alone. 
Her dying words of love and faith, 
I'll cherish evermore, 
Within the heart which holds so dear, 
The ring my mother wore.

Dear Evelina, sweet Evelina, 
My love for thee shall never, never die.

In neat graceful curls hangs her raven black hair, 
And she never requires perfumery there.

Evelina and I, one evening in Jane, 
Took a

The planets shone, for the heavens were clear, 
And I 
felt round my heart most mightily queer. 
Sweet Evelina, &c. 
Three years have gone by, and I've not got a

Although I

The birds were sinning in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The birds were singing in every bush 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And Bessie, the milkmaid, merrily sang, 
For meadows were fresh and fair. 
The breeze of the morning k:ssed her brow, 
And p!ayed with her nut-brown hair, 
But oft she turned and looked around, 
As if the silence scorning; 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning, 
'Twas time for the mower to whet his scythe, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
And over the meadow the mowers came, 
And merry the!r voices rang, 
And one among them wended his way, 
To where the milkmaid sang. 
And as he lingered by her side, 
Despite his comrade's warning, 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning. 
The old, old story was told again, 
At five o'clock in the morning.
