My dear Dr. Spivacke:
As I wrote you Professor Alton Morris has recorded Slavic songs in the vicinity of Sanford,
which we are forwarding to you today, as part of the work of the Florida folklore expedition.
A typed list of the songs was inclosed in the box with the records, as well as the longhand
notes of Professor Morris on each envelope. These records were obtained from the
University of Florida but Professor Morris is willing to give them to the Library of Congress
provided duplicates were furnished the Writers' and Music projects, as in the case of the
other records. Attached is copy of a letter which I received from Professor Morris today.
Sincerely yours, Carita Corse Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor, Writers' Project in
Florida
