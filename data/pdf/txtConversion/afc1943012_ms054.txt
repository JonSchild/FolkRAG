October 8, 1943 Dr. Horace Bond, President The Fort Valley State College Fort
Valley, Georgia
Dear Dr. Bond:
We have just sent you by express a set of duplicates of the records made by Professor
Willis Laurence James. You now have a complete set of duplicates as originally provided
for. Before we can close out the project, however, we must ask you to return all unused
blanks and the cutting needles which Lewis Jones left with you. May we hear from you at
your earliest convenience?
Sincerely yours, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge Archive of American Folk Song
