HAD a 
fanny dream last night. and oh! my, what a

dreamed it was in the year eighteen seventy-six; 
The preselit styles had passed away, anti wonders were not 
few, 
And now I'll try and see if I 
can tell then] all to you.

In eighteen seventy-six, my boys, oh! what a change 
there'll be, 
'Twill surely come io pass, for dreams prove true, they

TONY PA STOR'S 
I 
saw a 
prison where 0111 receut stealers were confined, 
The jailor said they hod to be to calm the public mind ; 
But ere the people knew it, one by one they were set free, 
And how they served two years in one was what bewildered 
me. 
enonce.—In eighteen seventy-six, etc. 
I 
dreamed the women all could vote, and on election day 
I 
saw them trudging to the polls, each bound to have her 
say ; 
And there they mixed with brawny men, and were for 
office run, 
And how 1 
grievet.il 
to think that they had such a 
style be-
gun. 
enont7s.—In eighteen seventy-six, etc. 
I dreamed that law and order was the front of honest 
sway. 
And the eontempt now shown for law had long since 
passed away; 
That rich as well as poor were made to feel justice to all, 
And when a man another shot they pinned him to the 
wall. 
Cnortus.—In eighteen seventy-six, etc. 
The mist of error was played out. for honest people knew 
.„ 
That lawyers left a loop-hoic just on purpose to crawl 
through; 
The juries were quite different, too, from those we've had 
before, 
And could as well indict the " rich," as doom away the 
poor. 
Cuonus.—ln eighteen seventy-six, etc. 
In 1776, my boys, one hundred years ago. 
Our infant country burst its bonds, and grappled with the 
foe, 
And on the great centennial 4th we'll make a 
stir, " you 
bet." 
Well let the whole world know that we've not forgot it 
yet. 
CHORUS—In eighteen seventy-six, etc. 
in eighteen seventy-six, my boys, oh! what a 
time they'll 
be, 
We'll kick up such a 
fuss with our great jubilee; 
We'll show you all, both great and small, some of our 
funny tricks, 
When our one hundred years are up, in eighteen seventy 
six. 
CHORE-S.—Ill eighteen seventy-six, etc. 
In eighteen seventy-six I 
hope you'll be alive and well, 
And I 
may sing again to you, and more predictions tell; 
So now 
leave you, hopiEg Him above, who counts life's 
sands. 
Will in His tender mercies hold your welfare in His hands.

You've heard of organ grinders, and of meat in German 
bands, 
But I 
think you'll say my tale beats theirs, when my case

That we all like old acquaintances, kind friend, you'll 
surely own.

S,he stopped so long before my box. I

That a notice of my show was in the country morning

The fair was over, I 
went to dancing booth close by, 
The moment that I 
entered, a 
sweet voice said, " Oh, my!" 
I recognized that face, that voice, and felt quite in a 
tremor, 
I 
asked her name, she blushed and said, its—Punch and

We danced together lot o' times, my love I couldn't

I 
once kept a

Where the vegetables did grow, 
But my fate is a

You'll say when you know; 
How I

fair damsel, 
Who's like I

So graceful and so beautiful, 
That I

None but sweet Mary Jones. 
Her parents kept a 
beer shop, 
Mary served at the bar, 
And used to draw custom 
From ever so far, 
With her eyes as bright as diamonds, 
And her hair as black us jet, 
She made me feel so fumitied, 
And entirely forget all about— 
CHORUS. 
My cabbages and my turnip-tops, 
My cucumbers and my Brussels sprouts, 
0, I'll never love, no 
never love, 
None but sweet Mary Jones. 
When I 
stood at the bar, 
I 
would heave a 
deep sigh, 
And when she looked at me, 
I'd wink with one eye. 
I 
one day plucked up courage, 
Looked as wretched as could be, 
Said, " I 
love you, sweet Mary, 
0 will you have me?" and all 
Cnonus. 
My cabbages anti turnip-tops. 
My scarlet beaus and my Prussian blues, 
0, I'll never love, no I'll never love,

Turned me out of the house, yes, 
And shook me as well!

TONY PASTOR'S 
Tip in the Monument. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
SOME like to spend their leisure hours 
At Margate or at Rome; 
Some ruralize at Sad well. 
And some rusticate at home. 
But when I 
have a 
week to spare, 
I'll tell you how it's spent, 
I 
take my sweetheart on my arm. 
And see the monument. 
Cnonus. 
Up in the monument touching the sky, 
Up in the monument ever so high ; 
Up in the monument a 
jolly day is spent, 
The cheapest place for courting is the monument. 
We clamber up and reach lite top 
Where seats are always placed, 
And if I'm so disposed I 
put 
My arm around her waist. 
It's ten to one there's no one there 
To spoil the sentiment, 
And so we have it to ourselves 
Up in the in 
Cnoncs.—Up in the monument, etc. 
We fancy we are by the sea, 
And gaze on Billinsgate, 
Where periwinkles proudly strut, 
And eels predominate. 
We see the wilds of hackney Marsh, 
And Tomlatektoo in Kent, 
And see what they've for dinner there. 
From off the in 
Cnoncs.—Up in the monument., etc. 
There welook down on every one, 
From off our isle of sky; 
We cannot spend much money there, 
Because there's naught to buy. 
There dissipation never dwells. 
All's mild and innocent ; 
I 
mean to spend my honeymoon 
Upon the monument. 
Cuoans.—Up in the monument, etc. 
Come 
all who play upon the flute, 
And go to bed at nine, 
Come country cousins, meek and good, 
To this retreat of mine; 
You'll find it is no fleeting joy, 
When you've made the ascent, 
mad, intoxicating bliss, 
That blessed monument.

THRO' squares and street corners 
On my beat how I 
wander, 
Thinking of the one who is dearest to me; 
She lives over yonder. 
Sixteen is the number. 
If she'd be my bride, oh how happy Pd be, 
Her name is Jennie, gentle is her manlier, 
I've long loved her dearly, as no tongue can tell; 
But I 
feel like a 
lost man, 
of late there's the postman 
Obtains all her smiles and good graces as well. 
Why should I 
grieve; how foolish I 
must be, 
Very plainly seeing that she don't care for me; 
But 1

Sang by Toxv PASTOR. 
PM an actor who's seen better days, 
For I 
once was a 
star, I've a 
-notion ; 
l've been tossed about all sorts of ways 
Upon the theatrical ocean. 
But jealousy, spite, and all that, 
hits brought me down to but a 
seedy ' un, 
It's been all eaused by envy— that's flat, 
For I 
once was a 
heavy tragedian. 
CHORUS. 
I've been a 
bright star in my time, 
Though now I'm reduced to a 
seedy ' an; 
In me you may please behold 
Junius Brown, the tragedian. 
20 
TONY PASTOR'S 
You have all seen my name in the bills, 
Which is Junius Antonius Brown, sirs; 
And I 
flatter niyself I 
have caused 
Great excitement in many a 
town, sirs; 
My last " shop was the Garrick, Whitechapel; 
in a " part " that I 
could above any fit, 
My "seven " 
sins, for only six nights 
Was two pounds and half a 
clear benefit. 
Sronrx.—That was money, but what do they offer talent 
now? I was actually offered the other day twenty-five 
per week to play Othello, the clown in the pato-
mime, and do bill-stieking in the morning. Did I 
accept 
it ? 
Blood and blue fire! 
Never! NEvEn! But no mat-
ter. it time may come when -they will be glad to secure the 
services of Brown, the -tragedian. 
Ctionus.—I've been a 
bright star, etc. 
Sinee Kenible, none like me's been seen, 
let naught but bad luck is my portion; 
My friends say I'm better than Kean, 
That my " Richard " and " hamlet's" a 
caution , 
They say my declaiming's a 
trcat: 
In the speech o'er Caesar, by Anthony, 
I 
can do the soft parts low and sweet, 
Likewise I 
can "pile up the agony." 
SPOKEN.—FOr two consecutive weeks was I the leading 
attraction at the Royal Bower, and should have startled 
the world at Drury Lane but for professional malice. I 
inn kept off the boards out of fear. 
They know I should 
render Shakspeare's great characters as they have never 
heen rcndcred betore. 
ly 
reading of the plays is entirely 
different to Maeready, Kean. Phelps, T. C. King, and all 
those fellows. They lawn that—but no matter, a 
time may 
come when they will cringe to Brown, the tragedian. 
Ctionus.—I've been a 
bright star, etc. 
I 
search through the " Era" each week, 
And I " write in " where talent's required, 
But they say they don't know me. (there's cheek, 
Of such insults and envy I'm tir(d.) 
They offer me terms for a " super,": 
Or ask if I'm up to " ul ility;" 
But I'll starve. and remain as I 
am, 
An artiste of wondrous ability. 
SPOKEN.— M E, ME! Junius Antonins Brown, descend to 
the cock in Hamlet, or Bobby in the pantomime. Ye gods 
and small fishes! 
Rather would I 
descend from my pe-
destal of fame and become a 
comic vocalist—but no matter! 
No MATTER! The time may come when they will be glad 
to pile gold at the feet of Brown, the tragedian.

"Iliew Jerusalem r or, Cruel Jane Jeinima. 
Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
A BILL hung in my window once, 
"A furnished room to let," 
A party came and took that room, 
Whom I 
shalt ne'er forget; 
A sanctimonious sort of chap, 
Whose name was Brother _Elam, 
He was a 
saint from Salt Lake City, 
Or, New Jerusalem. 
Cnonus. 
Cruel Jane .Temitna, 
Left her darling Sam— 
She's gone to be a 
Mormonite, 
In New Jerusalem—Oh, dear me! 
He'd bold forth on the joys of being 
A blissful Mormonite, 
While Jane Jeminia listened to 
His words with great delight ; 
He told us, 0! such glorious things, 
Did pious Brother Elam, 
That we thought no place could e'er equal 
New Jerusalem. 
CHORUS.—Cruel Jane Jemima, etc. 
He told us how each happy saint 
Had lots of happy wives; 
I 
thought they'd light. but 0, dear no, 
They led such happy lives; 
They lived on turtle, duck, and green peas 
Fricaseed ehieken and 
For the saints they lived like fighting-cock 
In this New Jerusalem. 
Cnortus.—Critel Jane Jemitna, etc. 
My wife was always at me 
To become a 
Mormon saint, 
Said I, " Don't take me for a 
fool, 
Jemima, ' cause I ;tint.' 
Alas! one night I 
missed her, 
And was told that Brother Elam 
Had taken my jemima off* 
To New Jerusalem. 
Cnonus.—Cruel Jane Jentima, etc. 
She's gone to be a 
saintess 
With that blessed Mormonite, 
. 
And if he's got another wife, 
There's sure to be a 
tight ; 
I 
hope she'll get the worst of it, 
And as for Brother Flaw, 
He ought to be shot with all the lot 
In New Jerusalem.

Sang by ToNY PASTOR. 
WAS an artful dodger once, but now you'll understand, 
I'm a 
most excellent member of the hallelujah Band: 
Our doings are notorious, and here 1 
may reniark, 
We've lately held a 
pie-mile in the grounds of Greenwich 
Park. 
It was a 
glorious morning, and we made a 
jolly start, 
Like angels going to Dixie in a 
covered canine's cart, 
So brotherly and sisterly, of friends about a 
score, 
And such a 
lot of loving lambs you never saw before. 
CHORES. 
Then you may go to Blackpool. Isle of Man, or Harrogate, 
Southport, Scarborough or search through the laud, 
But if you want a 
spree, that a 
saint can only see, 
You must join a 
jolly party in the Hallelujah Band. 
We reached the park at 2 
p. m., and wandering, we went 
On where to find a shady spot that we might pitch our 
tent; 
And soon we found a 
quiet spot, where we could sit un-
seen, 
To smoke a 
pipe, to sing a 
song, or dance upon the green; 
We introduced the eatables, the bottled stout and beer, 
With sundry drops of something short, our sinking souls 
to cheer, 
When Sister Sarah Spriggenbottom begged that Brother 
Prim 
Would sing her " Champagne Charlie," and she would sing 
a hymn. 
Cnonus.—Then you may go, etc. 
Now, when we'd done with Doctor Watts we took a 
turn 
at Bass, 
And drank success to temperance in many a 
flowing glass; 
We pledged each other manfully in wines of every sort, 
The women doing-ditto in a 
drop of something short. 
We 
satisfied the haler mail, then cleared the crumbs away, 
We danced and sang, declaring we laid spent a 
happy day ; 
Then had a game at kiss in the ring, and kissed each 
other's wives, 
And vowed it was the jolliest day we'd spent in all our 
lives. 
CHORUS.—Then you may go, etc.

Winking; or, the Itlisfortun

Winks. 
Bung by TONY PASTOR. 
A SAD young clog was William Winks, 
He had a 
way of sly:I'y wiii 
When e'er a 
pretty girl lo , 
Now 
this was very wrong, I'm thinking. 
As years rolled on this habit grew, 
Until at length great fears possessed him; 
As o'er his winks be lost control, 
His future much oppressed him. 
CHORUS. 
Wink, wink, wink, 
William Winks could not help winking, 
Whether talking, whether thinking, 
Whether eating, whether drinking, 
William Winks could not help winking; 
When away from danger shrinking, 
Heart within him almost sinking,i 
Oft he had to run like winking, 
Poor William Winks. 
He gave heart to Patty Prim, 
And as they walked alone one Sunday, 
lie pressed her so to " name the day," 
She blushed, and whispered " next Monday." 
When Monday came they went to church, 
And all went well until the bride said, 
When asked if she would " take this man," 
" 
No, no! he's winking at my bridesmaid, 
CHORUS.—Wink, wink, wink, etc. 
One summer eve while strolling out, 
A sad misfortune overtook him; 
There rushed across the road a 
man, 
Who seized him by the throat and shook him. 
"NOT POE mot" xOnSITEIL 
Poor Wink i 
gasped out, tho' almost choked,' 
•• Oh! do you wish to take my 
life, sir?" 
.!‘ You barefaced scamp," the man replied, 
• " 
How dare you wink thus at my wife!" 
CHORUS.—Wink, wink, wink, etc. 
Poor Winks then gave the man in charge; 
Before the court next day appearing, 
He stepped into the witness box, 
For his sad tale to get a 
hearing. 
The mayor roared out, " What, wink at met 
To act like this I 
can't permit you; 
This man's discharged, but for contempt 
, Of court, to goal l 
shall commit you." 
CHORUS,—Wink, wink, wink, etc. 
I 
think I've said enough to show 
How much poor William Winks has suffered, 
And I've no doubt that you begin 
To think that you have quite enough heard. 
Young men, take warning by his fate, 
Don't wink too much, you may repent it; 
'or you. like Winks. in course of time, 
May not be able to prevent it.

For the five o'clock ' bus was so full, don't you see, 
It was plain she must ride on some gentleman's knee. 
The lady was pretty and young, it was clear, 
And so we all said, 
Come and sit here, my dear;"

Ronnie Scotland." 
Bung by TONY PASTOR.' 
I'd mixed in good society, but 
Did not like all I 
saw, 
So resolved that when I 
took a 
wife 
I'd have one in the raw. 
It happened while in Scotland, 
In love I 
chanced to drop 
With a 
lass, who with her pa and ma, 
Dwelt on a.mountain's top. 
Cnonus. 
And I 
made her Mrs. Jones, 
Yes, I 
made her Mrs. Jones; 
She came from bonnie Scotland, 
And I 
made her Mrs. Jones. 
I 
brought my bride to town, 
Also her parents, when 
They gave me " muckle puckle," oh! 
And lots of " diuna ken." 
If I 
tried to understand them, 
I 
was sure to make a botch ; 
I 
could " parley Francais" well enough, 
But I 
couldn't " parley Scotch." 
Cnonus.—Like my funny Mrs. Jones, etc. 
The old boy likes his " whisky," 
Oh! and don't he like his snuff? 
But somehow never seems to know* 
When he's got " quantum suff." 
My wife serves me with Scotch-rappee, 
I 
do naught all day but sneeze, 
And she made me wear a 
kilt, 
Till I 
caught cold in my knees. 
CtiOnus.—Oh! that funny Mrs. Jones, etc. 
SPoRrx—Very foolish of her, you know, because, as I 
tell 
her, it don't suit me at all. 
She likes me in it, tho', but 
she's always saying, " Don't stoop so, Charles, stand up-
right." 
I 
say, " I 
can't, my dear, my kilt's too short." 
" 
Tat, mon," she says, " never heed, it's aw richt." " Oh! 
well, my dear, it may be all right, but you know I 
shall 
have:the Lord Chamberlain down on me; that'll be the end 
of it. 
You must understand, my dear, that we don't wear' 
this dress in London, except at court, and there it suds 
as full dress." 
Undress I 
call it. 
My wife is very fond of 
some kind of dried fish that she calls " Berries" and 
" 
Speldrums." As far as I'm concerned, I'd as soon chew 
wax cloth. 
She speaks Gaelic, too. 
She's taught me two 
or three words. " Kem-ar-ush-an-dew ;", that means, " How 
do you do ?'' " Kim-ar-a-ha-ta-hosh-an-poeh;" that means 
" 
flow are your poor feet ?" How's your poor legs„? would 
be more appropriate in my ease. I 
know I 
shall catch cold 
in my calves. I 
want to wear trowsers, but my wife won't 
42 
To 
PASTOR'S 
let me; she says it's not proper to wear trowsers with a

think it's very improper to be without them. How-

And she was not too (Tummy, nor yet too lean, 
Just the sort of girl for a

I'm not going to say that she's a queen, because I

Nor yet a

Her business it's not over grand; you can hear her, might

Then with cabbage-stumps, and orange peel, they'd pelt

But now I 
am dreadfully changed; 
And all my acquaintances say 
That I 
am insane and deranged; 
I

My senses have flown thro' my

And my heart is as hard as my steel.

But she's stolen my pluck and my heart;

But she spurned me, and then what was more,

She married the tailor next door, 
And ever since then I've been mad. 
SPOREN.— Mad! stark staring mad! She married the

had revenge; he took her abroad to Highbury, and there

practiced the Grecian Bend, and then she paid a lot of

Back to her house at once I

can't forget. the view; 
A man in uniform so grand was sitting there in state. 
He and Julia eating dumplings off the self-same plate.

For I'd married a

And did select France for our sweet honeymoon. 
We met there a

his whisker jet black, and so curly his hair, 
And he tried in vain to love to be looking

Now, Monsieur had.been thrifts', and tho' nearly fifty, 
Was single, he'd been a 
great flirt in his life; 
I 
would often sip sherry with him and be merry, 
But never once thought he'd an eye for my wife; 
He spoke broken English, but understood clearly. 
His French was the fancy of Nancy each day; 
'Twos the language, she said, that she loved very dearly, 
And wished Monsieur Bum

So .. popped him the question, and made a suggestion, 
To pay hint so much for a lesson each day; 
But he scoffed at the money in French, very funny, 
And said, ‘• Oh! for nothing me teach her do vay;" 
So I 
gave my consent, and she had his tuition, 
It pleased her quite well, I 
could see by her look; 
And soon she was able, and in a 
position 
To spout and ejaculate just like a

Years ago I

charm. 
But now I 
get so mach of it—it fills my heart with alarm; 
All clay she keeps on singing. my

They've grown so very musieal they nearly drive me mad! 
By friends I'm quite deserted, not one do f 
see, 
For twice a 
week, my wife she holds her musical soiree; 
My house is filled with foreigners, who squall, and bawl, 
and strum, 
Until I 
wish that I 
was deaf. or else the t

My daughter once so beautiful, on marriage now is bent 
With a 
seedy-looking German, and she's asked for my con-

And when I

She merely giggled in my face, and then begAn to sing :

Neglects his work, and fancies an heiress he kvill wed,

And lie's just about the cut for Belgrander, 
To keep game alive it is the plan, 
And he means to go ahead, for he's a Fashionable Fred, 
Yes, Fashionable Fred, the ladies' man. 
The boy in waiting, Joseph, once the smartest and the

Is getting quite unbearable, he's worse than all the rest, 
If I

He smiles upon Me vacantly, and wi & ties " Not for Joe." 
He stops with every organ man that he may chance to 
meet, 
And follows any German Band for hours thro' the street, 
If I threaten to discharge him, as I 
must without a doubt. 
And ask him who he thinks lie is, he'll then begin to shout:

Used to turn a

But she's sold her old mangle and bought a 
piano, 
And married the Marquis of Camden Town. 
One (lay I 
spoke to her, with love did 1 
burn, 
Said I, " You look tired, miss, let me have a 
turn ;" 
She smiled a 
consent, and to work did I 
go, 
how long I 
was at it, I 
really don't know; 
I 
soon felt fatigued, but I 
didn't care, 
I'd have turned for a month her sweet presence to share, 
At last fell on my knees, and while on the floor, 
I 
told her I 
loved her, and would evermore.

Pretty Polly Bangle, 
Used to turn a 
mangle, 
But she sold her old mangle, and bought a 
piano, 
And married the Marquis of White Chapel Road. 
I'd go there every day, and I'd turn for my life, 
At length she consented that she'd be my wife; 
I 
was nappy until I 
was told one fine day, 
Some one else turned her mangle when I 
was away. 
I 
told pretty Polly the tale I 
had heard, 
She said ' twas " redeket us, horful, habsurd ;" 
Said I, " I've your promise, and hope you're sincere, 
For if I've a 
rival, there'll be mangling done here.' "

And married the Marquis of Bloonlingsbury Square. 
After that she appeared to quite change in her manner, 
I•3he sold her old mangle, and bought a 
pianner; 
Now, I 
couldn't turn that, and—alt, me! one day, 
I 
found her house closed, and my love gone away.

TONY PASTOR'S 
They say she's retired from mangling for life, 
That some duke or some marquis has made her his wife; 
So I 
sighs, and I 
mourns, and I 
oft drops a 
tear, 
When I 
think of my 
love, and the mangling done here.

And married the Marquis of Blaekfriar's Bridge.

Charming Arabella, -vs 
Door, 
Sang by Tom-- PASTOR. 
ONelli went down to Margate, just for a 
change of air, 
Was never so amused in all my life while I 
was there; 
There were cockneys, dressed like sailors, who strolled 
upon the sand, 
Some snobs, a 
jolly lot of snobs, who liked to do the grand ; 
There were swarms of pretty girls, and amongst them 
there was one 
Who seemed a 
perfect Venus, whose eyes shone like the 
sun; 
She made the people stare, she electrified the town, 
When she walked along the street, with all her back-hair 
down. 
Ater itack-IlE7t.te 
CHORUS. 
She was a 
charming belle, in love with her I 
fell, 
And I 
really couldn't help it, for I 
felt done brown; 
Enough to kill a 
fellah was charming- Arabella, 
As she walked along the jetty with her back-hair down. 
Each morning in the water see her bathing I'd be sure, 
Of all the pretty bathers none like her could do the cure; 
After that she might he seen without her crinoline, 
A-strolling on the jetty quite as proud as any queen. 
You may guess there would be lots after such a 
girl as 
this, 
But I 
made her acquaintance, which I 
thought the height 
of bliss; 
As we'd promenade together many jealous looks were 
thrown 
At me, and at my charmer with the back-hair down. 
CHORus.—She was a 
charming belle, etc. 
One day we walked the jetty, the wind was rather high, 
Arabella scarce could keep her legs, by Jove! no more 
could I; 
But still we thought we'd stand it, altho"t was hard to 
stand, 
The show of pretty buckles upon that day was grand. 
 41114.1110iall 
— 
Of a 
sudden I 
felt stupefied, with both my eyes did stare, 
To see her hat, back-hair and all, go flying through the 
air; 
When I from my fright recovered, my 
charmer she had 
flow n, 
She hurried from the spot without her hack-hair down. 
Cnortus.—She was a 
charming belle, etc. 
I 
tried my best to find her, asjaughter met my ears, 
Instead of her I 
found her hair, midst most derisive jeers; 
It was her hair that charmed me, oh! false, deceitful miss, 
'Twas fastened to her hat, a 
fact, for here it is. 
(Produces hair.) 
I 
felt somewhat disgusted, and then tried her to find, 
But she'd started off for town, and left her lovely hair 
behind. 
I've never seen her since, tho' I've been in many a 
town, 
But I've had enough of charmers with back-hair down. 
Cifinms.—She was a 
charming belle, etc.

IN 
days gone by I

And patronized the Zoo, 
In love, too, with a darling fell, 
A charming girl named Lou'. 
But neither Zoo, nor charming Lou', 
Shall I 
e'er see again, 
I'm now devoted to the blues, 
My life is full of pain, pain, pain I

I should like to be an alligator, 
Ora curly crocodile, crocodile, dile, dile, 
But I'd rather be an alligator. 
Than be mourning melancholy for my own true love. 
To " do the Zoo', was one of Lou's 
Most favorite of wishes, 
And so we used to go and view, 
The birds, the beasts, and fishes. 
And whilst we watched the love-birds, 
And tho pretty doves a 
cooing, 
We settled that Saint Pancras Church, 
Should shortly - end our wooing, wooing, wooing.
