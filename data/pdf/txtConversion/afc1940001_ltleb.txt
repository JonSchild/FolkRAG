Little Brown Bulls Not a man on the river had MacCluskey to fear, As he swung his gored stick
o'er the big spotted steers. Young, quick, strong and handsome, girded eight foot and three, Said
MacClusky, the Scotchman, "You're the laddies for me." Then up came Bull Gordon when the rollway
was full, And shouted, "Whahush," to the little brown bulls. Short-legged and shabby, girding six foot
and nine, "Too light," said MacClusky, "to handle our pine." Now, 'twas three to the thousand our
contract did call, The skidding was good and the timber was tall. Said MacCluskey to Gordon, "To
skid the day full, I'll just skid two to one of your little brown bulls." "Ah no," said Bull Gordon, "that
you cannot do, Although your big steers are the pets of the crew. I'll tell you, my boy, you'll have
your hands full If you skid one more log than the little brown bulls." Well, the day was appointed
and soon did draw nigh, For twenty-five dollars their fortune to try. All eager and anxious when the
morning rolled around, And the boss and the scaler appeared on the ground. With a whoop and a
holler MacCluskey came in view, With the big spotted steers, the pets of the crew. Saying, "Chew your
cuds well, boys, and keep your mouths full, For today we will conquer the little brown bulls." Then up
came Bull Gordon with his pipe in his mouth, And the little brown bulls with the cud in each jaw. Said
Big Sandy to Gordon, "We've nothing to fear. For we'll never be beat by the big spotted steers." Well,
at sundown that evening our foreman did say, "Turn in, boys, turn in, you've enough for the day." All
numbered and scaled, each man and his team. And we thought that we knew which had knocked
down the bean. When supper was over, MacCluskey did appear With a belt ready made for the big
spotted steers, To make it he'd torn up his best mackinaw, As /he had conducted according to the
law. 2 of 2 Little Brown Bulls Then up jumped the scaler, "Hold on, boys, you're wild! Your big spotted
steers are behind just a mile, You've skidded one hundred and ten and no more, While Gordon has
beat you by ten and a score." How the boys did shout and MacCluskey did swear! And he pulled out
in handfuls his long yellow hair Said, "I'll just kill them and take off their skins, And dig them a grave,
and I'll tumble them in." So here's to Bull Gordon and Big Sandy John, And the biggest day's work on
the Wolf River was done. So fill up your glasses and fill them plum full, We'll drink to the health of the
little brown bulls.
