Alonzo the BraveA warrior so brave and a maiden so brightConversed as they sat on the green.They
gazed at each other with looks of delight;Alonzo the Brave was the name of the knight,And
the maid it was the fair Imogene.Up spoke the bold warrior, "Since now I must go,To fight in a
far distant land,Your tears in my absence well cease for to flow,Some other will court you and
soon you'll bestow,On a wealthier suitor your hand.""Hush, hush thy suspicions," fair Imogene
cried,"Offensive to love and to me,For if you be living or if you be dead,I swear by my honor no one
in your stead,Shall a husband to Imogene be."And if I for duty or riches decideAnd forget my Alonzo
the Brave,God grant that for punishment, falsehood and pride,His ghost at my marriage may sit
by my side,And bear me away to his grave."To Palestine hastened the warrior so bold,His love she
lamented so sore,But scarce had twelve months elapsed and beholdA Baron all covered with jewels
and gold,Arrived at fair Imogene's door.His presents, his riches, his spacious domains,Soon made
her untrue to her vow;He dazzled her wits, he bewildered her brain,He gained her affections, so light
and so vain,And bore her away as his bride.Scarce had the marriage been blest by the priest,And
the revelry then was begun,The tables they groaned 'neath the weight of the feast,Scarce had the
laughter and merriment ceasedAnd the bells in the castle chimed one.It was then with amazement
fair Imogene foundThat a stranger was placed by her side,His air was terrific, he made not a
soundHe moved not; he spoke not, he looked not around,But steadfastly gazed on the bride. 2 2 of

and merriment ceased at his sight;The dogs as they eyed him drew back in affright,And the lights
in the castle burned blue.His presence the Baron seemed to dismay,The guests sat in silence and
fear,When up spoke the bride, while trembling did say,"Sir knight, that aside [?] your armour would
lay,And feign to partake of good cheer."The lady sat silent, the stranger complied,And slowly his visor
he loosed,Oh God, what a sight met fair Imogene's eyes!What words could express her dismay and
surpriseWhen a skeleton's head was exposed!All present then uttered a terrible shriekAnd turned in
disgust from the sight;The worms they crawled in and the worms they crawled out,They sported his
temples and eye balls about,As the spectre addressed Imogene."Behold me, thou false one, behold
me," he cried,"And remember Alonzo the Brave.God grant that your punishment, falsehood and

pride,To take you for perjury, falsehood and bribe,And bear you away to his grave."While speaking
his arms round fair Imogene wound,While madly she shrieked in dismay,He sank with his pray in
the wide yawning ground,And never again was fair Imogene found,Nor the spectre that bore her
away.Not long lived the Baron, or none to this day,Do inhabit that castle of gloom,But chronicles
tell us by orders sublimeFair Imogene suffered the pains of her crimeAs they mourned her terrible
doom.They drank from skulls newly torn from the graveAnd danced round the pale spectres and
sang.Their drink it is blood, while a horrible stainCovered the crest of Alonzo the Brave,And his
loved one, the false Imogene.They say that at midnight three times in each year,When all mortals
in slumber are bound,Arrayed in her bridal apprisals of white,Appears in the hall with her skeleton
knightAnd she shrieks as he whirls her around. ALONZO THE BRAVE
