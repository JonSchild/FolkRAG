Nickerson:  Okay. So, this is Ginger Nickerson. And I am interviewing Alick Lord. 
 
Lord:  Yep. 
 
Nickerson:  On September 21, at the Grow Compost offices in Waterbury, Vermont. So Alick, 
could you tell me, well, I always start by asking people to tell me where they were born and what 
year they were born? 
 
Lord:  I was born in Vermont. Do you want me to get more specific? 
 
Nickerson:  Just the town. 
 
Lord:  I think it was Burlington. The one, that hospital. And my—it’s the door shutting (noise in 
background). 
 
Nickerson:  Oh! Okay. (laughs) So that background noise was the door shutting. 
 
Lord:  Yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  So you were born in Burlington, Vermont. 
 
Lord:  Yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  And what year? 
 
Lord:  Two thousand. 
 
Nickerson:  Okay. Great. Thanks. So could you tell me what your current job is and how long 
you’ve been in this line of work? 
 
Lord:  So my current job is pretty much the laborer for Grow Compost. I don't know how else to 
describe it other than the laborer or tote washer. Well, it used to be tote washer. Hopefully it’s 
changing. But how long I’ve been doing it? I’ve been doing it for probably, I think four years 
now. I know it was when I was fifteen, so three, coming on four years. And what I do is a bunch 
of labor stuff, like I give water to chickens. I wash totes. And a tote is a container that has two 
wheels and can hold trash and usually it’s used for trash, but we use it for food compost. And 
that food is filled up into that tote, and then it’s dumped. And then after it’s dumped, you still 
have the food scraps all on the inside so you need to get that off. Because people can’t really take 
2 
 
that into the kitchens and fill it up, and like it’s health hazard and all that. So I’m the one with a 
power washer cleaning it all.  
 
Nickerson:  And what are other things that you do? Because I know you do a bunch of different 
things here. 
 
0:02:46 
 
Lord:  I make Bioblend. That is a thing that we put on top of the compost. One, to get the smell 
[down], and then two, which is kind of the main one, actually, is the maggots that are crawling 
around in it and they don’t like dry. It’s basically a mix of sawdust and a little bit of peat, a little 
bit of coffee chaff and a little bit of stuff.  
 
I also dump oil, we get oil from companies. And we dump it into a big cube. And then we 
give it to Black Bear [a local biodiesel company] and they make it into biodiesel. 
 
Nickerson:  Biodiesel? 
 
Lord:  Biodiesel, yep. So there’s that. I also clean up around the shop. I also help fix the trucks 
when they’re broken. I organize the tools. I fix up totes when they get broken, because you can’t 
have them leaking all over the kitchen. I do it all. (laughs)  
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Kyle was just telling me that you weld the plastic totes. 
 
Lord:  Yeah. So some of our totes will get cracked and worn down over time. So when you have 
a crack and it’s leaking, then you need to stop it from leaking, because the food juice gets 
everywhere. So what we were able to do was we got this plastic welder. It’s kind of like a regular 
welder. It shoots hot air out of one end, and then you take the plastic, and we found the plastic 
that goes through the tote, that the tote’s made out of. And what it does is it kind of, it doesn’t 
melt it, because it’s not like drippy, like if you lit it on fire it would melt and drip. But it kind of 
like makes it a little mushy and it heats it up to the point where like you can push it up against 
each other, but it’s not runny or melty. And you kind of just take one [piece of plastic] and you 
put it on the other. It’s like welding. And you just weld plastic onto it. 
 
Nickerson:   And tell me about the chickens. What do you do with the chickens? 
 
Lord:  The chickens, there’s many things that I do with the chickens. First I water them and 
collect eggs. And then I also clean out their boxes, which get very dirty. And I also clean out 
their houses and all that.  
 
Nickerson:  And the chickens are eating the compost, right? 
 
Lord:  Yeah. The chickens eat the compost. It’s a little bit of a mixture. They scratch at it, so it 
kind of gets a little mixed up and they eat it. And then they crap and it adds to the whole thing, 
too.   
And then every now and then, you have a fatal injury, like where a truck comes up and 
wasn’t paying attention, and hits a chicken. You add that to the compost, and so on. Animals 
3 
 
come out of nowhere, you know, eat one [of the chickens]. And then, all right, throw it in the 
compost. 
 
Nickerson:  So are you guys selling the eggs? 
 
Lord:  We were at one point, but our chickens here are really old. So eventually, well, some are 
really young. But some of the eggs, we can’t really tell which are from the old ones. But they 
started like smelling a little weird. So we’re not going to risk selling them and hurting other 
people. So we don’t sell the eggs anymore. We used to. We used to sell a lot. We used to sell 
them down at [names a local restaurant]. 
 
Lord:   And we used to sell them at the shop here. 
 
Nickerson:  Oh, okay. So how did you get into this job? 
 
0:07:43 
 
Lord:  A bunch of ways. My brother, he worked here before me. He worked probably I think two 
years here. And then I think his third year, which was kind of a half a year, I joined in. And I 
didn't really start in full-blown, like working every day. But it was a, you know, I think a 15 
year-old’s job. Like work two hours a week, get a good paycheck and go and buy food with it 
and all that. I remember just getting my first hundred dollars and oh, that was so much. And now 
I’m making more than that, I’m like, oh, okay, this isn’t that much. But make it work. 
 
Yeah, I started out just doing a little bit of stuff with my brother. And then my brother went on to 
do something else. So I came into the picture, and I was friends with the boss’ kids. So I was 
hanging out with them on the property. So I was kind of learning the job a little bit on the 
property, because I would see other people doing it. So eventually I’m like, I need more money 
than a hundred bucks. So I started working a little bit more. And then they ended up kind of 
moving away. So I was less hanging out and more actually working.  
 
And then my work ethic kicked in and I ended up being a valuable worker, because I actually 
worked hard and put in a lot of effort. And I kind of liked it. And so I was like all right. So then 
after two years of just kind of not really caring, but working to make money. And then actually 
after a while, then after two years, I’m like, all right. So I started actually working fulltime 
during the summer. And now I’m completely fulltime all year round, so.  
 
Nickerson:  When did you go to fulltime year round? 
 
Lord:  Actually just last year. So kind of last year was my first fulltime year. When I started last 
summer, I was like, okay. Since I had this program with my school that allowed me to work for 
credit. 
 
Nickerson:  Oh, great. 
 
4 
 
Lord:  So the problem was during the wintertime I actually had school, so I couldn’t really do 
anything. So I was like, uh, I got to quit, or I come in and work like two hours a day, not even, 
because it’s an early-starting job and ends early. So by the time I’m getting out of school, they’re 
ending the work here. But since we had the work credit thing, I was able to work through the 
wintertime while I was supposed to be at school. And then, so it was my first winter here, and it 
was pretty brutal with the negative-degree weather. And washing totes. 
 
Nickerson:  Oh, man. Yeah. So tell me what that was like. What were you doing in the— 
 
Lord:  I was still doing everything that I was supposed to be doing. But it just took a lot more 
time. I remember just waking up one day and it being negative, I think, 30 degrees. And I was 
going to go in early at like six o’clock. And I kind of looked at the weather and I saw, because I 
knew it was supposed to be cold. I didn’t know it was supposed to be that cold, but I knew it was 
supposed to be cold. And I looked at the temperature, and I looked outside and there was barely 
any light. And I’m like “nope, I’m not going to go in.” But eventually I ended up coming in, but 
I didn’t go in that early. But there were times that I had to come in at four o’clock, just so we 
could get through the day. 
 
Nickerson:  Four a.m. in the morning. 
 
Lord:  Yeah, four a.m. 
 
Nickerson:  Wow. In the wintertime. 
 
0:12:21 
 
Lord:  Yeah, in the wintertime. I’d come up and we have a light here, since it’s dark at that time. 
I’d plug in the light. I’d get my hose started. And I’d put on like ten layers, walk out there. 
Which the ten layers didn’t do anything, because you’re spraying water on yourself. And I’d bust 
out a couple of totes, and then I’d walk inside and realize I’m just ice, like all down. And I’d 
come in when I’m sick, because I know it needed to be done. So, yeah, it was a tough winter. 
Especially for my first winter. (laughs) But I got it done. 
 
Nickerson:  So you guys work through all kinds of weather conditions. 
 
Lord:  There’s only one weather condition that I noticed that they really are sensitive about, and 
that’s thunderstorms. 
 
Nickerson:  Oh, yeah. 
 
Lord:  Because metal poles and lightning don’t really go together. (laughs) So that’s the only one 
that they are kind of like, “All right, let’s stop washing for a little bit.” And we’ll actually ease up 
on washing. But other than that, totes need to be washed, totes need to go out. So as long as the 
trucks are going, we’re going. 
 
5 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. Yeah. So could you walk me through what you do on a typical day, from 
when you get here in the morning to when you quit— 
 
Lord:  So I’ll probably show up around six or seven. Lately I’ve been coming at seven when I 
want to be at six, but, got to get up. So I come in at six or seven. And I’ll get my uniform on. 
And that usually is, it’s the process where I’m like “all right, I’m at work now. I’ve got to 
actually be awake and get the stuff done.” So that takes about a good 15 minutes to finally [be], 
all right, I’m here.  
 
And I’ll kind of like take another 15 minutes going around and “all right, what’s the day going to 
be like?” I go and I check out the chickens and I come inside and I look around. I go outside and 
I see all the totes that were left over from yesterday, because sometimes I leave other washers to 
see what they didn’t finish. And so I’m like, “all right, what’s the route today? How many trucks 
are coming back? Okay, it’s going to be that.” And then eventually after I’ve done that, I’ll start 
by cleaning, or I’ll do what’s most important for that morning. So, some mornings are different. 
Like some mornings, the trucks come in at eight. So depending on what time I came in, that 
means I’ve got an hour before they come in. Or I’ve got until they come in at like noon. So I’m 
like, how important are the totes? And if the totes are more important, then I go in and I wash the 
totes. But if the totes aren’t that important, I come inside and I clean up a little bit.  
 
And then after cleaning up, and I realize there’s nothing else to really clean—well, there’s many 
things to clean, but only the things I can clean. I go out and I collect eggs. At this point, we’re 
not really selling the eggs, so I kind of feed them to the chickens. They enjoy them. (laughs) 
Then I come back in and I start fixing totes, or I look for something to do. 
  
And then eventually the bosses come in, or the truck drivers come in. And I can either 
wash or I talk to the bosses, I’m like, “what needs to be done?”, and usually they give me 
something to do. Like, “Oh, oil needs to be dumped,” or, “Hey, I actually need help on fixing 
this truck.” Usually Scott [Baughman, one of the co-owners of Grow Compost] takes me under 
his wing and we kind of go around whizzing, and then eventually he gets a phone call or realizes 
he has to do something that’s important and heads off. And then I’m left to either washing totes 
or looking for something to do. 
  
And so it’s on and off like that all day. There’s some days that the bosses don’t come in 
and I’m left to my own devices, which is washing totes and fixing totes and whatever else needs 
to be done. Taking care of the chickens and giving them water, or cleaning their cages and all 
that. 
 
Nickerson:  Tell me about fixing the trucks. 
 
0:17:38 
 
Lord:  Fixing the trucks. I’ve seen a lot of them break down. So there’s one that we recently just 
fixed. It was a Peterbilt. And the brakes on it needed to be redone. Usually what happens is one 
of the people here that really knows what they’re doing starts by taking them out and they’ll tell 
me like what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. So the Peterbilt needed new brakes to be 
6 
 
inspected. So we were taking out the air cans. And I watched them do it, I watched one person do 
it. And after that, there were four that needed to be replaced. So that took like a long time, so that 
was like one day, just replacing that one. And we didn’t even get it all replaced. 
 
 
And then the next day, someone else was working on it. So I kind of gave them tips on 
how the other person did it, because they were having issues along with what the other person 
that I was working with did. And so eventually like by the second one or third one, I was able to 
kind of realize, all right, what the steps were to replacing these air cans, so that I kind of took 
over and helped out a little bit more than just standing and watching. I started actually taking the 
parts off and connecting parts, and connecting them back, using wrenches and all that. So it 
usually starts out me watching at first and then learning, and then doing. So.  
 
Nickerson:  Is that a part of the job that you like? 
 
Lord:  I really never thought, I always thought it was very confusing on how you fix up cars and 
all that. I was like, “oh, I’m never going to be able to do that.” That seemed like it was too 
complicated. And some of my friends, and I know most people sometimes are like very obsessed 
with motors and all that. And I’m like, it’s too confusing, I’ll never be able to do that. But after 
seeing my coworkers and actually me thinking “oh, they know everything about this!” And then  
seeing them struggle a little bit, too, it’s like, “oh, you’re human, too. Okay, so maybe I can 
figure this stuff out. “ And then after working with it a little bit, I’m like “oh, it’s like a big 
jigsaw puzzle.” Like you don't know what those parts are doing, you just know those parts are 
there and they need to be replaced by like a new part, and you know what that part is. So it’s like 
oh, okay, so it actually is not that complicated. And people that actually I thought got it, didn’t 
really get it. So it’s like, all right. So I started to like it a little bit more after that. 
 
Nickerson:  It didn’t seem like such a mystery. 
 
0:20:48 
 
Lord:  Yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. I’m just trying to think which question I want to ask you next. If somebody 
else was thinking about working here, what kind of knowledge or skills do you think would be 
good for them to have? 
 
Lord:  That’s a good question. (laughs)  
 
Nickerson:  Or what kind of knowledge and skills do you feel like you— 
 
Lord:  The one skill they need, I feel like, the one thing that really got me good here, was a good 
work ethic, or just motivation to do what you’re doing because it needs to be done. Because there 
are some days that I come in and I’m like “nope, I don’t want to do this, but it needs to be done.” 
And I’ve seen many people like show up and like, “You’re unbelievable. I don't know how you 
do this.” Because they just couldn’t handle the work. You’ve just got to work hard, and you’ve 
7 
 
got to know that what you’re doing will one day pay off. So you’ve just got to have that 
motivation to be like ‘all right, this eventually will mean something.’  
 
And it’s funny, because it’s the most important part of the job. Like I’m on the low level 
of the people here. Everyone’s pretty much above me. But it’s the most important job.  
 
Nickerson:  Washing totes? 
 
Lord:  Washing totes. It’s almost as important as trucking. I feel like they’re kind of on the same 
level. Because without one, you can’t have the other. But that’s our number one selling point 
right now is, we wash our totes. Kitchens love it. They’re like, “oh, clean totes. We don’t have to 
worry about this nasty-smelling thing that’s just standing there like garbage cans, and all that.” 
So yeah, just a good work ethic and knowing what you’re doing is actually helping the business. 
And skill, knowledge and all, you don’t really need to know that much. I didn’t know that much 
going in, but then I learned a lot coming and doing it. So you don’t really need to have that much 
knowledge. Just know that what you’re doing is important, and just hope that it will pay off. And 
it might, you know. I’m still up in the air, wondering if it will pay off. But I’m hoping. 
 
Nickerson:  What do you mean when you say pay off? What would it look like if it were to pay 
off for you? 
 
0:23:51 
 
Lord:  Well I know it’s a struggling business. I’ve seen this business go. So like I would leave 
for a whole winter and I’d come back and see how it happened. And when I first started out, it 
was just my brother and one other person and the bosses running the business. And their kids 
helping a little bit here and there. And then they hired somebody else. And I’d see that other 
person. And it was just, it was small. It was so small compared to what we have now. They had 
one truck barely going out every day. And then I came in the next summer and there’s more 
people working here, and there’s actually that truck is now going out more than it was, and all 
that. And then just the last winter, not this winter, but the last winter that I had away from here, I 
left the business with one person trucking. And he was probably doing three runs a day with 20 
totes. So that was 60 totes that were coming in and out of here every day. And we had I think one 
person washing. And we had just the boss, the owner, and his wife running it all. And I come 
back the next summer and we have two trucks on the road hauling. I think how much [totes] we 
were getting a day, 60 a day just in one load. 
 
Nickerson:  Wow. 
 
Lord:  Because they would do multiple [runs]. So we went from 60 to 120 [totes a day]. Like we 
doubled, a day. And we had two bosses, we had a mechanic and another tote washer. And I was 
like, “whoa, okay!” So it dramatically jumped. So just seeing it grow like that. So you know, it 
does pay off. It did start small. I saw it start small. So I’m hoping that the small business, will get 
big. And I’m hoping that I’m a part of it. I’m the one that is like, all right, I was there. I saw that 
happen. And that’s my payoff is just being a part of the business growing. 
 
8 
 
Nickerson:  How many totes are coming in to get washed now, either per day or per week? 
 
Lord:  We’re pushing out, I think, on a maximum day we’re doing, I think, about 200. And that’s 
probably two days that we do 200 totes, probably. And on a minimum day I think we’re doing 
80. 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah, yeah. And do you have a sense of why the business is growing? 
 
Lord:  I don’t. I wish I did. Either, I know that there are laws in play now saying that people do 
have to compost and all that. And I feel like Scott and Lisa [Ransom, Baughman’s wife and the 
other owner of Grow Compost] are kind of learning. And they’re learning to get better and they’re 
building their skills. And we’re probably meeting new people and expanding —because I’m 
pretty sure when they started out they knew a couple of people that could help them out. But I’m 
pretty sure we’re meeting more new people, and expanding our [talk?]. And we’re getting known 
a little bit more. We did go from a different kind of industry, a little bit. Like I’ve seen a jump 
from, we were mostly doing compost in the beginning. I would come in the beginning and do 
bagging. Which we don’t do that much anymore. I know in the springtime, we pick it up a little 
bit more [referring to bagging compost]. But we were doing eight pallets full in the beginning. 
Oh, sorry. (clears throat) 
 
Nickerson:  Do you want some water? 
 
Lord:  Is there any water around here? 
28:47 
 
[End Track 1. Begin Track 2.] 
 
Lord:  Have you not been recording? 
 
Nickerson:  [Was not recording for a bit] Fortunately, it wasn’t a lot. It was just that bit at the 
end. I don't know if you want me to ask you that question again? 
 
Lord:  You can. (laughs)  
 
Nickerson:  Is that okay? 
 
Lord:  Yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  You can just give me a shorter answer. If you could describe the place of work, what 
it looks like and smells like and sounds like. 
 
Lord:  (laughs) So you’d get a stinky smell. You would see piles of compost that you really don’t 
understand why the piles are there until you actually work here. And you’d see a lot of workers. 
And you’d see people washing totes. If you were to drive up, you’d see them washing and be 
like, “oh, I’m sorry that you’re doing that.” 
 
9 
 
Nickerson:  And you said you’re wearing— 
 
Lord:  We wear these goofy outfits where it’s rain pants, and you’re on a mat and you’ve got a 
messed up tote holder kind of thing. And you throw your tote up. And everyone’s looking at you 
like okay, this guy’s crazy, or just something. So, yeah. It’s a goofy looking place if you come up 
and you just see things. 
 
 
There was one time that Scott was helping me do my Bioblend. And it gets dusty, so 
we’ve been starting to wear masks. There was one time he put on the mask and he’s helping me. 
And he all of a sudden needed to do something. So he gets on his loader and he doesn’t take off 
his mask. And he’s driving off, driving with a mask. And I looked at my friend, I’m like, “We 
should just put on masks, and then when people come up, be like, ‘You can’t be here, nope!’” 
(laughter)  
 
Nickerson:  Like there’s some kind of contagious disease or something? 
 
Lord:  Yeah. 
 
Nickerson:  I’m just going to go back for a minute. You said something about the totes coming 
from kitchens. So are these mostly from, where are the totes coming from? Are they mostly 
restaurants, or— 
 
Lord:  There’s restaurants. There’s grocery stores. It comes from various things. We have a 
brewery that gives us the kernels or whatever they make beer out of in totes. We get it from the 
ski resort in Stowe. We get them a bunch of places. There’s kitchens, there’s restaurants that we 
get it from, The Wayside. That’s a popular one I know. We get it from Applebee’s. We get it 
from Shaw’s all around. 
 
Nickerson:  Yeah. And some of the other [compost] places might not be washing their totes 
between pickups? 
 
Lord:  No.  
 
0:03:09 
 
Nickerson: But you guys do. 
 
Lord:  Yeah, we wash them. We’re the only one that kind of has that system down. There’s other 
people that are putting bags in them now, I heard. That might be working. I don't know.  
 
Nickerson:  So the other question I’m going to go back to, are if there are dangers or physical 
risks, if you feel like there’s physical risks with this job? 
 
Lord:  No physical risks. Like you’re not going to break a bone. But you know, like I said, if you 
aren’t paying attention, I blast music and just pound it in my ear. There are sometimes where 
they’re just standing right next to me, “Alick! Alick! Alick!” And I’m like, “Oh, what’s up?” I 
10 
 
just like to blast everything out. So as long as you’re alert and paying attention, there’s no 
dangerous scenarios. You’re still going to fall, you’re going to scrape your knees, you’re going 
to cut your hands because you were holding a metal thing and it was sharp on one end. But 
you’re not going to like, I haven’t seen anybody got severely hurt. Yeah. Other than chickens. 
 
Nickerson:  Right. Right. So if you were going to start over, is there anything that you would do 
differently? 
 
Lord:  (laughs) You ask me on the right day, I would say not come. I would do anything 
differently? Even though I already work a lot, I would probably work more in the beginning. 
Because I did like working, I love it, I think I’m turning into a workaholic a little bit. It’s just my 
outside life that kind of keeps me away from it. But I do, I wish I worked a little bit more. 
 
Nickerson:  And do you feel like this job provides a livable wage? For another young person 
who might be interested, somebody else just getting out of high school? 
 
Lord:  Yes. For a teenager, as long as you’re still with your parents and you’re not paying that 
much for rent. If you’re paying a good amount for rent, but not an insane amount, then yeah. I 
paid for my car insurance. I pay a little bit of rent.  I have a credit loan, I have a couple other 
bills, like I have Spotify, because I listen to music. I have a good amount of bills, I know it 
wracks up. So, yeah, I think you could do it. And then I also like to eat a lot out. So I spend most 
of my money on that and I’m able to do it. So, yeah. 
 
0:06:48 
 
Nickerson:  So what advice would you give to someone else who’s just getting out of school 
who’d be thinking about maybe taking a job like this? 
 
Lord:  (laughs) Don’t waste my time. Because I’ve seen so many people come in and just leave. 
I’d tell them bring music. Bring a good work attitude. Be prepared to like work and be proud of 
what you’re doing. And just hope that what you’re doing is good. And just enjoy working. Like 
there has to be a special person that [wants to do this], we’re good at finding them, but they’re 
rare. You’ve got to have that person that’s like, “You know what? Tthis job is actually, it’s 
horrible, but it’s something. It’s fun.”  I enjoy it, you know. But nobody’s crazy enough to say, 
“Oh, this job is perfect, I love it to death.” No, I hate it but I love it at the same time. I can’t 
really explain it. So you just got to be prepared to come in and just love what you’re doing. And 
actually stick to it. You need to be a good worker. You need to be a great worker, apparently. 
Because I’m incredible. So you’ve got to do half of what I do, apparently, to be a good worker. 
 
I’ve been told too many times about that. There’s one dude that literally told me I was 
working too hard for this job and I should join another job making more money. I was like, 
“Nope, I’m good.”  I don't think I’m working that hard here.

Lord:  Just, you know, we’re hard workers in this line of work. Like I said, there’s not that many

There are many dedicated workers here.

appreciate your time.
