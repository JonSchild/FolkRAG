Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 188o, by A. J FISHER, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at IVaskington. 
Thinking of Home. 
Written and sung by -M YLES M ORRIS, in his great Nautical Specialty. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, x880. 
Many a 
night on the silent deck, 
Have I 
gazed on the stars above, 
And I've looked abroad on the tranquil sea, 
Till my heart was filled with love, 
Thinking of home and the dear ones there, 
Till I 
felt the tear drops flow, 
Breathing in silence a 
fervent prayer, 
For the friends of long ago. 
CHORUS. 
Many a 
night, yes many a 
night, thinking of home; 
Many a 
night, yes many a 
night, thinking of home. 
Father and mother and sister dear, 
Come to me in my waking dreams, 
And I 
hear a 
voice and I 
see a 
face, 
Which to me like an angel seems. 
Ah, did I 
not give her my parting vow, 
And the broken ring to keep ? 
Spirit of beauty, hear me now, 
As I 
sigh upon the deep. 
Many a 
night, &c. 
But proudly the flag of Columbia waves 
Wherever the salt seas flow, 
To the frozen deep or burning clime 
Her sons will gladly go, 
Doing and daring in her dear name 
All that man can do or dare, 
Thinking of home I 
have longed for fame 
For the sake of the kind hearts there. 
Many a 
night, Scc.

Timothy Mulvaney, with Farragut. 
Original Recitation, by Mvi.Es MORRIS. 
'Twos during the war—how well I 
remember 
The day I 
enlisted—the fourth of December. 
We sailed from New York next day before light, 
Our crew were all sp'iling, av coorse, for a 
fight. 
Why shouldn't we fight ?—' tis an Irishman's boast 
To fight to the last for the friend he loves most. 
Well, as I 
was a 
saying, our ship went to say, 
And went through the Narrows out into the bay. 
An' soon Staten Island was hid from our view, 
While above and around us was nothing but blue; 
An' we felt blue, also, at dawn of next day, 
When they told us that we were to fight in the bay, 
To engage with the ships whether willing or not, 
An' get for our trouble an ounce of buck shot. 
To stand an' be shot at like bulls in a 
pen— 
I 
wouldn't trate pigs that way, let alone men. 
If they'd give us shilalehs, begorra! we'd fight 
All the day long, an' through the lone night. 
But niver a 
stick would they give us on board, 
They gave each instead a 
pistol an' sword. 
Sez I " What'll I 
do when the fight becomes thick ? 
I'll be lathered completely widout a 
good stick." 
Then said ould Farragut, our vessel's commander, 
Himself could stand fire like a 
fire salamander. 
Sez he : " My brave fellows, we'll soon have a 
fight, 
The enemy's vessels have just hove in sight." 
Part of the crew were below, but he called to them. all: 
" 
Pass up from the lockers the powder and ball! 
Clear the decks, an' get ready for action, 
A 
brush with these fellows will give satisfaction ; 
We'll come to close quarters, an' give them a 
shake !" 
Begorra! my legs were beginning to quake, 
To quake like the divil, wid fright an' wid fear, 
TIMOTHY NIULVANEY, WITH FARRAGUT. 
Continued. 
When I 
found out the enemy's ships were so near. 
The balls were soon whistling, the firing was hot, 
If I 
stay on deck longer I'll be kilt an' be shot. 
So, hastily turning my back on the foe, 
I 
beat a 
retreat to the deck down below. 
" 
Said I: " My brave bouchal, you're safe here at last, 
Divil a 
fut will I 
move ' til the danger is past !" 
A 
large keg of butter conveniently lay 
Near to the spot where I 
wended my way. 
The balls of the enemy fell thick an' fell fast, 
Sez Ito myself: " Sure, I 
hope it won't last, 
An' while they are fightin' I'll sit on this keg, 
Unless a 
stray shot might take off my leg; 
I 
can't well spare either, I 
have only two, 
An' if I 
lose one, yerra ! what'll I 
do?" 
When above the dread noise an' the firm' I 
hear 
The voice of ould Farragut ring out full an' clear: 
"Where's Timothy Mulvaney, that son of a 
gun?" 
Sure I 
thought the ould Admiral said it in fun. 
But niver a 
bit, for he meant what he said, 
For he roared out still louder, " Tim Mulvany, are ye dead ? 
For if yer dead, why not spake, an' tell me yer shot?" 
No answer. 
Said I 
to myself: " Faix, I'm not 1" 
And in the same tone: " Although I'm not dead, 
I 
might as well be, for I'm spacheless instead." 
" 
But captain avourneen," in a 
whisper I 
spoke, 
Just then a 
stray shot from the enemy broke— 
Smash! through the keg, an' the contents were spread, 
Knocking me down, sure I 
thought it was lead. 
It threw me down flat, but I 
rose in a 
sputter. 
When I 
found myself covered all over wid butter, 
I 
tasted, I 
smelt it, ' twas butter, no lie— 
An' I 
got a 
big lump of it into my eye. 
Said my mother,when blessing me: " May you have grace." 
Begorra! I 
got plenty of grease in my face! 
'Twas comfort, not grease, that I 
wanted just then, 
So I 
ran up on deck, an' sez I 
to the men: 
" 
Lather them well !—never stop !—never turn ! 
The balls they are firing were made in a 
churn. 
Don't give them a 
rest—don't you see they are tiring— 
Begorra ! it's only butter they're firing !"

Ireland's Freedom. 
First sung on any stage by MYLES MORRIS, the great patriotic vocalist. 
Dedicated to the Irish member of Parliament, M R. CHARLES STEWART 
PARNELL. 
Hurrah for Parnell and the cause be advances! 
The heart of old Ireland once more is aglow; 
The troubles we meet with the end but enhances 
We're nearing the goal, boys, ah, surely if slow. 
Freedom! see how it shines! Slavery once more declines, 
The rainbow of hope illumines the sky, 
On our loved native ground, can cravens there be found, 
To shrink from the fight when our aim is so high ? 
CHORUS. 
Freedom! see how it shines! Slavery once more declines, 
The rainbow of home illumines the sky ! 
On our lov'd native ground can cravens there be found 
To shrink from the fight when our aim is so high. 
Steadily, still, like the waves of the ocean, 
We seek what our fathers were robbed of of yore: 
On the altar of Ireland we've pledged our devotion, 
And sworn that as slaves we'll be ruled, boys, no more. 
Look at our present plight, caused by the English blight, 
Starving our peasantry here on our plains; 
Sorrows around them cling, wailings but from them spring, 
Deadened their voice in the clank of their chains, 
CHORUS. 
Look at our present plight, caused by the English blight, 
Starving our peasantry here on our plains; 
IRELAND'S FREEDOM . 
Continued. 
Sorrows around them cling, wailings but from them spring. 
Deadened their voice in the clank of their chains. 
Up for the cause boys ! the tocsin is sounding; 
The curse that divided and weakened has fled : 
See into life and full vigor is bounding 
The body they thought, boys, stark, stiffened and dead! 
See o'er the waves appear, resplendent, calm, and clear, 
Liberty's sun, that they hid from our sight, 
Vainly their hate pursued, God with fresh strength imbued--
Still on our side have we honor and right. 
CHORUS. 
See o'er the waves appear, resplenderit, calm, and clear, 
Liberty's sun, that they hid from our sight; 
Vainly their hate pursued, God with fresh strength imbued, 
Still on our side have we honor and right. 
Blest be each name that the holy war wages ! 
Who could the shrine of his country profane? 
The dreams of our patriots, poets, and sages, 
Is left to their sons to uphold and maintain. 
Come, then, as brothers forth, West: East, South, and North, 
join in our serried ranks, the vanguard come swell; 
Raise the old cry again, shout it from mount and glen, 
God and our country !— Hurrah for Parnell! 
CHORUS. 
Come, then, as brothers forth, West:Mast, South, and North, 
Join in our serried ranks, the vanguard come swell; 
Raise the old cry again, shout it from mount and glen, 
God and our country, hurrah ! for Parnell.

Terry Maguire. 
Irish patriotic song, sung with great success by MYLES MORRIS. 
Oh my name is Terry Maguire, I 
am here at your desire ; 
Ould Ireland is my nation, that you very well might know. 
Like every true born Irish lad, I 
love my own dear native sod, 
Her praises I 
will always sing, wherever I 
may go. 
'Tis true I 
wear the corduroy, and carry a 
shillelah toy, 
And faith now I 
can use it, in defence of friend or foe. 
I'll stand up against any man, with ready stick and hostile hand, 
That dare malign the island where the green shamrock grows. 
There's that little isle across the sea, ' tis famed for hospitality, 
Pat never turned a 
stranger that was hungry from his door. 
Your confidence he would not betray, his fault is generosity, 
That's why he wears a 
ragged coat, and oftimes looks so poor, 
lie loves the little girls all, and why not, but he takes his little 
drop— 
His head is light, his heart is warm, he is sensitive also. 
lie would humble be, though proud is he, an enemy to tyranny, 
For he loves the little island where the green shamrock grows, 
Oh good luck to you, America, the land of great prosperity, 
Your North of full and plenty, and your South of sunny fame, 
Your East full of industry, your West with plenty laden— 
May adversity a 
stranger be to Columbia's happy name. 
'Tis the grave of many of Ireland's sons, who were the first 
to fire the guns, 
Defending your bright standard against your country's 
bitter foe ; 
So don't dz.spise the Irish boy, with crownless hat and corduroy, 
That comes from that dear island where the green shamrock 
grows.

Barney's Serenade. 
Writ-,en and sung by MYLES MORRIS, in his great character of Barney 
the Guide. 
Dedicated to ELLA MURPHY, of the MURPHYS. 
I 
am thinking, Norah darling, of the bright days when the 
starling 
Sang its sweet notes as we wandered o'er the lea, 
And the dew was on the clover, with the blue sky bending over, 
When I 
whispered you were all the world to me ; 
And the music of the thrushes, and the roses of your blushes, 
When you laid your little head upon my breast. 
All this world was full of glory, as we told the old, old story, 
While the golden sun sank slowly in the west. 
CHORUS. 
like a 
starling, 
rake my blessing, Norah darling, with your voice so 
And your pouting lips like cherries ripe and red ; 
Sure this poor heart came near breaking, while my fortune I 
was making, 
But I've just come back to Ireland now to wed. 
Oh to me the sweetest bliss is the remembrance of your kisses, 
As you looked up fondly, smiling through your tears; 
And you said you'd true be ever, and you would forget me never 
While your little heart kept thumping with its fears. 
Are you still true to your Barney, with his bit of love and 
blarney, 
As when he said good-bye and kissed you at the door? 
Oh, my love, I 
did not tarry, but I've hastened home to marry, 
For my pockets are now filled with gold galore. 
Take my blessing, & c.

Sung in character by MYLES MORRIS atTony Pastor's Theatre, New York. 
On dusty road, mid city strife, 
No matter where we travel, 
The world's against the poor old tramp, 
He's everywhere a 
rebel. 
The farmer's wife denies him food, 
His very look speaks danger, 
Take pity on the poor old tramp, 
An outcast and a 
stranger. 
CHORUS. 
The house dog's barking at my heels, 
The watchman springs his rattle ; 
The lockup is my bed and board, 
I 
sleep on straw like cattle. 
My hat is old, my shoes well worn, 
My toes all laughing through them; 
My pant-legs crawling to my knees, 
No patches can renew them. 
My threadbare coat with buttons gone, 
Its tail has followed after ; 
Misfortune claims me as its own, 
I 
hear but jeers and laughter. 
The house dog's barking, & c. 
TRAMP'S LAMENT. 
Continued. 
Once I 
was young, and plenty filled 
The old red barn and byre; 
My mother's loving face I 
see, 
My brother, sister, sire. 
My father's manly form was bent, 
When years ago we parted, 
My wife and children all are gone, 
Behold me broken-hearted. 
The house dog's barking, & c. 
A 
burden on the town I've been, 
When years ago I 
counted 
My lands and houses by the score, 
With love and cheer surrounded. 
Misfortune came, no hand to help, 
I 
beg, I 
cannot borrow, 
The poor-house soon will be my lot, 
I 
care not for the morrow. 
The house dog's barking, &c. 
Kind friends, within your happy homes 
Where want ne'er casts a 
shadow, 
Take pity on the friendless tramp, 
Deal gently with his sorrow ; 
Deny him not a 
crust of bread, 
That saving cup of water, 
Nor lose reward in store for those 
Who hope for joy hereafter. 
The house dog's barking, &c.

CHORUS. 
Tramp, tramp, away, oh, sing about your regular troops, your

None to beat the Fusileer, joy and pride of all beholders, 
With their grand and rollicking style,which pleases and endears, 
Famous in the army are the Killarney Fusileers. 
They're the boys for gallantry, sure, the terror of the army, 
Hearts of steel for enemies all, hearts so soft for woman's 
blarney. 
They're the boys so steady and firm, that know no fright or fear, 
On they go in gallant array, the Killarney Fusileers. 
Tramp, tramp, away they go, rattle the drums, the bugles blow, 
Proud and fierce these soldiers gay, the Killarney Fusileers.

Ould Ireland I 
Adore. 
Written by W ILLIAM CARLTON, the Irish Comedian, for NI YLES M ORRIS, 
AIR:—" Harp that Once thro' Tara's Hall." 
Oh Erin's Isle, my heart's delight, I 
long to see thee free, 
Where'er I 
am, by day or night, this heart beats warm for thee. 
I 
am grieved to see thee so oppressed, but what can I 
oo more, 
Oh gra machree I 
weep for thee, ould Ireland I 
adore. 
Oh hard must be the tyrants' hearts that links you to their chain, 
And yet your sons have took their part on many a 
well fought 
plain, 
But yet you bound down as slaves, while we our loss deplore, 
Oh gra machree, I 
weep for thee, ould Ireland I 
adore. 
Now I 
wish to know what we have done, that still we can't 
be free, 
But this I 
know, we had a 
son, who struggled hard for thee, 
John Mitchell was that hero's name, he was known from shore 
to shore, 
Oh gra machree he'd have set thee free, but alas he is no more. 
Now if we were free as once we were, how happy might we be, 
No English landlord then would dare to lord it over thee ; 
We would have our homes, and bread to eat, as once we had 
before, 
Oh gra machree, may we live to see ould Ireland free once more.

The Happy Irishman. 
Sung by MYLES MORRIS everywhere with great success. 
Oh, ' tis happy an Irishman ever will be 
In America—listen, the land of the free, 
Where whiskey is plenty, an' money galore, 
While at home we have ever the wolf at the door. 
If there's plenty to do we're always content, 
An' thankful to heaven for what has been sent; 
Our consciences easy, light-hearted an' free, 
No king on a 
throne is more happy than we. 
An Irishman bears on his broad face a 
smile, 
Estranged though he be from Erin's green isle, 
No country born gossoon ever can be 
More happy than we from the isle of the sea. 
Unlike other people, no sorrow, no care, 
Find in their bosoms, light-hearted they are; 
They're happy an' merry, as merry can be, 
In America, whisper !—the land of the sea.

Name the' Day, Kathleen. 
Sung by Itlyt.Es MORRIS. 
Down by the hedges the hawthorns still blossom, 
Beautiful, lovely and bright with its blooms, 
While down in the meadow the tall grass is growing, 
Breathing a 
lovely and fragrant perfume. 
CHORUS. 
Then hear me, avourneen, a 
minute, my darling, 
I'm goin' to discoorse ye ; come, listen to me: 
I'm tired of waiting, won't you give me an answer, 
An' name the day, my cushla machree? 
Whisper, my darling, I've the purtiest cottage 
On the banks of the Shannon, close by the say; 
I 
built it meself for the loveliest crature, 
And Kathleen, ' tis built out of soft yellow clay. 
Then hear me, &c. 
Oh what would it be if you where not in it, 
To gladden the heart which beats only for thee; 
Then name the day Kathleen, and don't keep me waiting 
Kathleen my darling, my cushla machree. 
Then hear me, &c. 
Years shall pass by, an' silvered your ringlets, 
And time may bring trials an' troubles to thee; 
But Shamus' love will lighten all sorrows, 
So name the day, Kathleen, my cushla machree. 
Then hear me, & c. 
You may drink of the dew that falls from the heavens, 
That glisten like pearly drops ' neath the sun's ray; 
While you gladden the heart of the boy who adores you, 
Then Kathleen, my darling, oh, jist name the day. 
Then hear me, & c.

Norah, I'm Going Away. 
Written by M. J. WILTON. Sung by MYLES MORRIS at the Theatre 
Comique, Washington, D. C. 
Don't sit by the windy so lonely, 
I 
know sad your heart it must be, 
You're sighing, I 
know it, acushla, 
That soon I'll be far o'er the sea. 
The evening falls 
On thirn castle walls, 
Where so oft we used to play ; 
Dry your eyes and kiss me darling, 
Norah, I'm going away. 
Don't grieve when I 
leave thee all lonely, 
Don't say: " He won't come back to me;" 
Don't think that your Dermot is faithless, 
My darling, my cushla machree. 
Then don't ever repine, 
For this heart is all thine ; 
My love for thee never shall die. 
Then cheer up, mavourneen, macushla, 
An' wipe that big tear from your eye. 
I 
know that your loving heart grieveth, 
But don't let this grief break your heart 
'Tis sad that I 
am, sure, to leave you, 
That loving ones ever should part. 
How I 
loved to trace 
In your gentle face 
The future all glowing with joy, 
I 
know you would say: " The world holds no other 
Like Dermot, your broth of a 
boy."

The Rattling Irish Boy. 
As sung by MYLES MORRIS with great success. 
Int a 
rattling Irish boy, 
And my name is Pat McCoy, 
In praise of Erin's isle I 
sing, that country to me dear. 
No matter how fools prate, 
The truth to you I'll state, 
To defend her true born sons, myself it is that's here. 
CHORUS. 
Gay and free all the day, 
Full of life anti joy, 
Land or sea, ' tis all to me, 
I'm the rattling Irish boy. 
The world throughout search all about, 
And beat him if you can. 
The divil a 
one you'll find, I'll Own, 
Like the rattling Irishman. 
The thistle Scotland names, 
The rose ould England claims, 
But to Ireland my country, the shamroek is her joy. 
Oh may the day be nigh 
When her green flag shall wave high, 
Far above ould Englnad's red, says the rattling Irish boy. 
Gay and free, &c. 
Pat's the boy to fight and win, 
And for fun or fame goes in, 
And his love for Free Ameriky none can from him destroy. 
As her page of history shows, 
He stood up against her foes, 
And with her sons the laurels shared did the rattling Irish boy. 
Gay and free, Sze. 
Here's success to Erin's sons, 
Both big and little ones; 
May they obtain those rights which England would destroy. 
We'll free her, boys, ere long, 
And then we'll sing in song, 
Ould Ireland forever, says the rattling Irish boy. 
Gay and free, & c.

MY name is Roger O'Malley, understand, 
And don't begin for to doubt me; 
I 
own my own house, and a 
bit o' land, 
There's no common stock about me. 
I

And left with heaps of lore; 
And came out here to this free land, 
Just pravious to the war. 
CHORUS. 
Roger O'Malley, that's my name 
Quite famous I 
have grown; 
I'm far superior to Muldoon, 
Mulcahey or Malone. 
I'm quite independent in my way, 
High-ton'd and well educated; 
All my taxes I'm ready for to pay, 
And I'm not in the least dissipated. 
I'm as daeent a 
man as you can find, 
Like all my seven generations; 
With a 
good deal of laming in my mind, 
Which I 
use on important occasions; 
I'm far above yer common scraps, 
That fling their names all round, 
And they'll not catch me in any traps, 
For I'm sensible arid sound. 
Roger O'Malley, die.

With a

Sure, in martial aflairs I'm no baby.

Made up in the style you see; 
My walk is grand, and plainly shows 
That there's no such man as me.

It's a 
shame on the stage how they mimic our race, 
In a 
style that's a 
mystery to me. 
How the gentry in front will stand such insults, 
And receive such block-heads with glee. 
But if they went to old Ireland they'd make their mistake, 
For our boys in style are well dressed, 
And in manners as well to you I'll now tell, 
Sure they stand in this land with the best. 
CHORUS. 
• 
For singing and dancing, and all kinds of fun, 
And if ever to old Ireland you went, 
From their head to their toes they wear stylish clothes— 
I 
speak of a 
True Irish Gent. 
Some make up their face and look just like fools, 
And walk like a 
dog with three legs ; 
But if they went to old Ireland to show them such fun, 
They would pelt them with stones and bad eggs. 
For it's there you'll find ladies and gentlemen, too, 
Educated, kind-hearted and true, 
And I 
hope that we'll see that little isle free, 
And the green with the red, white and blue. 
For singing and dancing, &c. 
Sons of Erin's Isle. 
Title and music composed by PADDY M URPHY. 
Copyrighted by A. J. FISHER, 1879. 
We've heard marshal songs and songs of the sea; 
Love songs and comic songs, but they don't suit me. 
We love to sing of Ireland—sweet land of our birth— 
I'm Paddy, her son, and she's my mother earth. 
Oh Erin, my country_ it grieves us to see 
Our enemies prosper, and yet we are not free. 
We fight for other countries as through life we roam, 
When half of our fighting would free our old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for the sons of Erin's Isle! 
Hurrah for the daughters, who on us do smile 1 
A 
fig for her foes, where- ever they may be; 
Three cheers for old Ireland and sweet liberty. 
Then arise, sons of Erin, and prove to the world 
The sunburst of freedom is once more unfurled. 
Be united like brothers, and join hand in hand, 
Then you'll drive the proud Saxon from off of our land. 
Sure the land is the people's, and who dare to dispute 
The word of our maker—for he spoke the truth. 
Then desend from the hill, and arise from the glen, 
And once more the battle of freedom begin. 
Then hurrah, &c.

What is it ? 
COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and music 
Sung with gTeat success by 
M URPHY and M ACK. 
It's very strange indeed to me, that go where'er I 
may, 
So many queer remarks 1 
hear about me every day ; 
'Twas but last night upon the street, my style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " You can have it pards, if you guess what it is !" 
SPOKEN—As 
soon as they saw me they shouted, " Here it 
comes !" and as I 
approach they all began to sing— 
CHORUS. 
What is it ? heavens what is it ? 
Does it live do you know ? or is it a 
chromo ? 
Did it blow out, or did it grow out ? 
Oh ! for heaven's sake, what is it ? 
'Twas in the Park, a 
lively mob at me did talk and stare. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's loaded, and if that's all its own hair," 
" 
It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, its pulse is all serene. 
Approaching me " Old Krank," says he, " I'll see that you're 
kept green! 
SPOKEN—Yes, and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
Look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes the 
conundrum— 
What is it, ea. 
They 2.sked how long I 
walked alone, and say " when were 
you canned ?" 
And hint I'd look much better if upon my head I'd stand; 
And as around the Square I 
walk, with gloves and cane and 
pipe, 
I 
heard them whisper everywhere, " I 
wonder if it's ripe !" 
SPOKEN—Yes, they want to know if I'm natural or artificial, 
and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, and whether I'm 
good raw t .Biat abcni 
111 they wildly ask— 
What is it, &c.

An' tine clause he brought her to make her look gay, 
And she was the sweet creathure so fall o' good nathure, 
An' as fair in act] fathure iz the blossom o' Mary,

Just to get a mile from sweet Mary, 
The pride iv her dad and his dairy, 
Och! she was his delight an' the pear'11 iv his sight, 
An as frishkey an' blithe as fairy, 
But so plase you, sweet Mary lov'd one Paddy Rarey 
Who could dance like a 
fairy an twer'll a 
shtick; 
Tho' his birth was a 
misthry could thrace his ancisthry 
Thro' tie pages iv histhry to " Amonachnic;"

Say'n " before they expell us we'll all take the sack,'D 
One wint home to his garden an' ( cravin yer pardon) 
lie dug up the devil and shoveled him back, 
An' some shouldhered arums an' others sung psarums. 
And many thried charums till their houses they burrn'd, 
And the papers related iv " deaths contemplated" 
Thro' love it was shtated, which wasn't returned

By the beautiful heart killin Mary, 
The pride iv her dad an' his dairy, 
OCh ? she was his delight an' pear'll iv his sight, 
An as frishkey an' blithe as a

So one day to her father, sez Mary, I'd rather 
Be single for life, than that life shud be ruled 
By a 
crawlin ould weaver, and I'd not have the craver 
If the hair of ins head hoong wid diamonds and gold." 
Sez her father, " Daunt raise me, for the divil may saize me, 
If yer ever have Pat I'd as lave see yer dead," 
The he turrn'd like a

The pride iv her dad an' his dairy, 
Och! she was his delight an' pear 11 iv his sight, 
An' as frishkey an' blithe as a

But at last she got betthur and wraut Pat a 
letthur, 
Telling him to forget her, an' bid him good bye ! 
Then she gave a 
great shiver, flue away to the river, 
Axed Iteav'n to forgive her and prepared for to die! 
"Come away from the wather," shouted Ned, "my dear daughter 
And you shall wed Pat an' have all yer dad's tin," 
But it wasn't so aisy, for the spot bein' grazy, 
An' her bent' crazy, she slipped an' fell in, 
CHORUS. 
An' all down to the bottom went Mary, 
In sight of her dad an' his dairy, 
Och I

I 
LOVE TO ROAM, 
Sung with great applauie at the Globe Theatre, Broadway, New York 
by Miles Morris, the celebrated Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
I'M an Irishman, me name is Dan, I 
was born in Ballinderry 
On a 
bright May day in '43, on the other side of Kerry ; 
My mother kept a 
little pig, and me she kept to mind it, 
But like every other little pig, shure it carried its tail behind it. 
CHORUS. 
SO 
I 
love to roam, and left my home, and traveled to a 
far off 
land, 
But altho' I 
cross the ocean, I 
don't forget devotion to poor old 
Ireland. 
Now I 
left behind in Ireland a 
girl I 
love so dearly, 
She was nursery maid in a 
great big house, they paid her ten 
pounds yearly, 
IIer eyes were like the little stars that shine in heaven so 
brightly, 
And like a 
pair of mountain goats, we dance about so sprightly. 
So I 
love to, SLc. 
Now my colleen's name was Mary Jane, her age was two and 
twenty, 
Iliad no money on her to spend, although I've spirit plenty, 
The times were bad my heart grew sad, it was hard to get a 
And if employers gave me work, poor wages they were giving. 
So I 
love to, Sc. 
So to Americky I 
made my way, and friends I 
found warm-
hearted, 
But I 
can't forget old Ireland yet, and from those from whom 
I. 
parted; 
I 
like the boys and I 
like the girls, and I 
like the American 
manners, 
And shure if they want an Irishman, I'll fight beneath their 
banner. 
As sung with thunders of applause everywhere, by M ILES Mounts, 
the popular Irish Comedian and Vocalist. 
I LEARNED my reading and writing at Ballynaggert, 
when I 
went to school, 
It was there I 
first took to fightin' wid the schoolma.ster, 
Mr. O'Toole, 
He and I 
we had many a 
scrimmage, but the divel a 
copy 
I 
wrote, 
For there wasn't a 
gossoon in the village could stand on the 
tail of my coat. 
Crioars. 
Dare stand on the tail of my coat, ah! just tread on the 
tail ormy coat, 
If you're in for a 
row or a 
ruction, just stand on the tail of 
my coat. 
I 
was an illegant hand, too, at courtin', for lessons I 
took 
in the art, 
Till cupid, the blackguard, while sporting dhrew an arrow 
straight through my heart, 
Judy Connor, I 
lived straight forninst her and tender lines 
to her I 
wrote, 
but the divil a 
boy in the village could stand on the tail of 
my coat. 
Dare stand, &c. 
But a 
big trotter, Mickey Malony, tried for to steal her away. 
He had money and I 
hadn't any, so a 
challenge I 
sent him 
next day, 
Next morning we met at Killalley, and the Shannon we 
crossed in a 
boat, 
Oh, I 
lathered him with my shillalah, for he stood on the 
tail of my coat. 
29 
Now my fame is spread over the counthry, folks flocked to 
gaze upon me, 
They all cried out without hesitation your a 
fighting man; 
Mickey Magee, 
I 
fought with the Finigan faction, and I 
hate all the Mur • 
phys afloat, 
So if your in for a 
belly-go-tisther, just stand on the tail of 
my coat. 
Dare stand, &c. 
I've traveled through Lister and Munster, Kilkenny, and 
Connaught likewise, 
It was there when I 
first was a 
youngster, I 
opened this 
pair of brown. ekes; 
It's there you'll sale fire without smoke; for a 
shilling 
you'll buy 50 eggs,

POOR WHITE SLAVE, 
By HARRY BURNS. 
AIR—Slavery Days. 
ToluNG slowly, day by day, 'till his life has pass'd away, 
And they give him scarcely room to lay his head; 
He drudges, morn and night, to earn his scanty bite; 
All his luxuries are water, scorn and bread. 
They never sing his praise 'cept on election days; 
And they often call him scoundrel, tramp or knave; 
All the world may keep him down with many a 
sullen frown— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
CHORUS. 
No matter where it be still he never can be free; 
The poor will ever have to stoop and crave. 
His coat is ragged, tore, let us kick him from the door— 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
Great Beecher tells the poor they are well enough, he's sure, 
If they get but bread and water all the while. 
If ever there is a 
hell they'll chuck him in pell mell; 
He will surely get the middle of the pile. 
We never look for joy, there's none for you or I; 
Still how our suffering hearts try to be brave; 
How it makes the tear-drops fall when they tell us after all 
We are nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc. 
Those with riches hold full sway for their millions gaineth day; 
It has been our valiant legislator's boast, 
The slaves may put me in, but I'm sure 'twill be no sin, 
To always work for those who pay the most; 
Yet, still we can forgive, 'tis only while we live, 
When this mortal life is passing at the grave; 
Then we'll surely bless the day we so often heard them say 
He is nothing only a 
poor white slave. 
No matter where it be, etc.

THE HAT ME FATHER WORE. 
Air--‘4 lama MoLLY 0!" 
FM Paddy Miles, an Irish boy, just come across the sea, 
For singing or f3r dancing, boys, I 
think that I'll please ye ; 
I 
can sing and dance with any man, as I 
did in days of yore, 
And on Patrick's Day I 
love to wear the Hat me father wore, 
CHORUS. 
It's o1d, but it's beautiful—the best you ever seen; 
'Twas worn for more than ninety years in that little Isle so 
green. 
Frotn my father's great ancestors it dcscended with gallore— 
It's a 
relic of old decency, is the hat me father wore, 
I 
bid you all good evening—good luck to you I 
say, 
And when I 
cross the ocean I 
hope for me you'll pray; 
I'm going to my happy land in a 
place called Ballymore, 
To be welcomed back to Paddy's land with the hat me father 
wore. 
It is old, etc. 
And when I 
do return again the boys and girls to see. 
I 
hope that with old Erin's style you'll kindly welcome me, 
With the songs of dear old Ireland to cheer me more and 
more, 
And make me Irish heart feel OW 
with the hat me father 
Wore. 
It's old, etc.

The shamrock Home. 
Dedicated to JOHN RAYNOR, the rising Irish Comique, by BEN COLLINS, 
Sung by Jlio. REILLY. 
In Erin's Isle—the shamrock's home, 
A 
darling fond and true, 
A 
lilly fair, with golden hair, 
And cheeks of the brightest hue. 
I 
soothed her sorrow, bade farewell, 
Murmurred, " Katie, think of me," 
Grasped her father's hand and left 
To cross the stormy sea. 
Katie, darling, think of me as always by your side, 
And never fear, my colleen dear, 
I'll return for you, my bride. 
CHORUS. 
Katie, mine, when the winter wind is snarling, 
The love of my colleen will cheer me always. 
Think of our parting sorrow and starting, 
I'll remember you, too, in the long summer days. 
I 
often think of the happy days, 
When Kate and I 
did roam, 
By the old mill that's running still, 
Where the waters dance and foam, 
It was there I 
met her in the evening, 
Throwing pebbles at the tide, 
Homeward bound, what happy moments, 
She was by my side , 
I 
am thinking of her all day, 
Long My Cushla Gra Machree, 
And dreaming of her lovely face, 
it fills my heart with glee.

WHEN ERIN FIRST ROSE, 
By the F1ELDINGS. 
WHEN Erin first rose from the dark swelling flood, 
God blessed the green island, and saw it was good: 
The Emerald of Europe, it sparkled and shone,-
In the ring of the world, the most precious stone. 
In her sun, In her soil, in her station thrice blest, 
With her back toward Britain, and her lace to the West; 
Erin stands proudly insular, on 'her steep shore, 
And strikes her high harp, 'mid the ocean's deep roar. 
By the groans that ascend from your forefather's grave, 
For their country thus left to the brute and the slave; 
Drive the demon of bigotry home to his den, 
And where tyrants made brutes, now let Erin make men. 
Let her sons, like the leaves of the shamrock unite, 
A 
partition of sects, from one foot-stalk of right, 
Give each his full share of the earth and the sky, 
Nor fatten the slave where the serpent would die. 
Alas! for poor Erin, that some are still seen, 
Who would dye the grass red, from their hatred to green; 
Yet, oh when we're up, and they're down let them live, 
Then yield them that mercy which they would not give. 
Arm of Erin be strong, but be gentle as brave, 
And uplifted to strike, be still ready to save 
Let no feeling of vengeance presume to defile, 
The cause of, or man of, the Emerald Isle. 
The cause it is good, and the men they are true, 
And the green shall unite with the Red, White, and Blue. 
And the triumphs of Erin her daughter shall share, 
With the full swelling chest, and the fair flowing hair. 
Their bosoms heave high for the worthy and brave, 
But no .cowards shall rest in that full swelling wave; 
Men of Erin awake, and make haste to be blest, 
Rise arch of the Ocean, and que 
of the West.

There'd a 
little Irish lady 
Has won from me my heart, 
She's as fair as fair can be, 
An' she's lately came from Ireland, 
Across from the ould dart, 
She's promised she'd wed me, 
Her eyes are blue as heaven's hue, 
She's got the sweetest name,

Ould Erin's pretty posy, 
She's handsome but not vain.

With my little Rosy, 
No, there's not another one 
Half so fair to me, 
Pretty pearl, my fresh girl, 
Love and truth combined, 
Won't it be a 
happy day 
When I 
call her mine. 
If you saw this little daisy, 
She'd surely set you crazy, 
You'd say none were so fair 
With her blush of maiden sweetness, 
She's elegance an' neatness, 
A 
jewel rich and rare, 
When all is done and we are one, 
With joy my heart will beat, 
An' a 
home I'll have so cosey, 
With little Irish Rosey, 
The sweetest of the sweet.

The Man that Stole the Country. 
Written by FRANK E. McNisH, expressly for M URPHY and MACK. 
We'll tell you of a 
terrible thief, 
Who for stealing things could not be beat. 
He'd even steal the grub he'd eat, 
The man that stole the country. 
In his sleep he'd dream of what he'd done, 
And when he'd awake, the son of a 
gun. 
He'd get up and go out and steal for fun, 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
He stole a 
horse, he stole a 
cow, 
A 
stack of hay and a 
cast-iron plow. 
He swiped a 
dog most dead with old age, 
A 
whole my,- of footlights off from a 
stage. 
Last night he came in this very place, 
And took the nose right off a 
man's face. 
\11 kinds cf fish, from a 
whale to a 
perch, 
Even the steeple of Trinity Church. 
A 
pile of timber, a 
liberty pole, 
Stewart's body he must have stole. 
He was bred of a 
family of very bad rank, 
lie stole all the bonds in Manhattan Bank, 
The Elevated Road he would have got 
If it hadn't been riveted to the spot. 
He'd steal the tongue out of your mouth 
While you would be talking; 
He stole the shoes off O'Leary 
While he was a 
walking. 
He stole a 
mule that was dying with cramps, 
Then went out \Vest and collared all tramps ; 
Into a 
shop and sneaked out the boss, 
Over to Philadelphia and nipped Charlie Ross. 
In Gilmore's. Garden he collared the track, 
j-le even tried to steal Murphy and Mack, 
THE MAN THAT STOLE THE COUNTRY. 
Continteed. 
And still he wasn't satisfied--
The man that stole the country. 
To Blackwell's Island he was sent, 
And life- time given to repent 
For things he'd done with bad intent— 
The man that stole the country. 
I3ut the villain he was very bold, 
And prison walls could not him hold, 
And he's around again, so we're told— 
The man that stole the country. 
CHORUS. 
A 
pair of boots a 
tub, and a 
saw, 
The wonderful man with the cast-iron jaw. 
A 
full brass band, and a 
new piano, 
The ballot boxes in Louisiana. 
President Hayes' ulster and beaver, 
Went to New Orleans and took the fever ; 
Came to New York to steal Hell Gate, 
And he'd had it, too, if he hadn't been late. 
He stole a 
whole gang that were out on a 
lark, 
If he hadn't been watched he'd had Central Park, 
Stole a 
street car, the driver and all, 
Then went up and took Tammany Hall. 
ToDk a 
cop right off from his beat, 
Stole all the bears there were in Wall street. 
To steal the City Hall he often did wish, 
He took the false teeth away from McNish. 
He stole a 
house they had just finished building, 
Took Bessie Turner from Theodore Tilton. 
Into a 
school and nipped the teacher, 
He'd had Elizabeth, too, if it wasn't for Beecher. 
Stole some young folks that were playing backgammon, 
Wmt tc the London and stole Murphy and Shannon, 
And still he was not satisfied—

Just Because I Am Irish.

success by DAN M CCARTHY, the great Irish vocalist and dancer.

Oh, I 
came to this country a 
short time ago, 
To better my fortune to find, 
For the old country, sure, is a 
very hard place, 
For any poor hard-working boy. 
But it's little better here, to my sorrow I 
find, 
As I 
search for employment each day, 
And to get it I 
can't; and the reason is this, 
Just because I 
am Irish, they say. 
CHORUS. 
Just because I 
am Iri -
3h they would give me no 
Just because I 
am Irish they cry, 
But where ever I 
go, ill good fortune or woe, 
I 
will still be a 
true Irish boy. 
Donovan's Dance. 
Written and sung by DAN MCCARTHY. Music by T. F. KERBICW,t. 
I was down last night to Donovan's dance, 
Where the boys and girls did sing and prance. 
Such a 
noisy gang I 
never did see, 
And never in my life had I 
such a 
spree, 
Old Donovan himself was managing the floor, 
And old Casey, the piper, was sitting at the door, 
When Mrs. Moriarty, while a 
pedling out the becr, 
Run against old Casey and knocked him out of the chai -2 
Cnonus. 
There was lots of fun for all the boys, 
work, 
And lots of rum and lemon pies, 
There was pipes, tobacco, punch and tea, 
And we danced like the devil 
until the break of day. 
Ain t 
it hard now,I ask you,that such things should be 
In a 
country where all are free men ? 
What have Irishmen done, now I 
plainly ask you, 
That such slurs should be cast upon them ? 
In America's troubles in'days long ago, 
In the battle fields, fiercest arrayed, 
They did nobly fight for their God and the right, 
" 
Just because I 
am Irish," they cry. 
(Chorus.) 
I 
will say little more; I 
don't wish to offend, 
As my aim it is ever to please, 
And this world is a, hard one to the poor,you all know 
With but little comfort and ease, 
There's a 
haven of rest away up in the skies 
That is ever pleasant and fair, 
And God, in His Infinite mercy, I 
know, 
Will admit all good Irishmen there, 
(Chorus.) 
There was One-legged Dougherty a 
sitting on a 
btrrci. 
With long Gill Riley and cross-eyed Farrell, 
And Miss 01Rooney's sister, Jane 
Was dancing a 
jig with Daniel Kane. 
Then One-legged Dougherty—he got tight, 
Heaped on the floor and wanted to fight, 
And we fired him out before he had a 
chance, 
Sure we had the devils's own time at Donovan's dance. 
(Chorus.) 
Words by THOMAS MAGUIRE, and sung to the air of " Little Robin, Tell 
Kitty I 
am Coming;witli great success, by DAN MCCARTHY. 
Come, gather kinds, and listen, 
And a 
story to you I 
will tell, 
You, no doubt, have heard of Erin's great heroes, 
Who 
in the latest of battles have fell. 
But the greatest of things that have happened, 
And may never happen no more, 
Is the escape of the six Fenian prisoners, 
Away from Australia's shore. 
Cuouus. 
Let us hope then the day is not distant, 
When the Irish shall rise up in bands, 
And sever the bonds that unite them, 
And make of themselves a 
free land. 
When these good men were sentenced in Ireland, 
Their country for trying to save, 
They were sent to the shores of Australia, 
And there made the proud Saxons' slaves, 
And they served out ten years of their life time, 
And they vowed that they would serve no more, 
So they escaped on the good ship Catalpia, 
And sailed for America's shore. 
(Chorus.) 
When the good men escaped to the whaleship. 
The authorities thought them to stay, 
So they sent out their warship Georgetta, 
Before they had time to away. 
" 
Now, we want you to deliver those prisoners, 
Or on you we will fire if you lag." 
And they answered, •' If on us you fire, 
You will be insulting our American flag."

Mrs. Mulligan and meself took apartments fine, 
Along the road of the elevated line; 
'Twas the other night, at tin. whia we'd both got into bed, 
That we heard a 
terrible racket right up over head ; 
I 
rushed up to the roof to see what was the row, 
'Whin I 
saw all of our neighbors' cats having a 
pow-wow ; 
I 
wint down to Mrs. Mulligan to have her come and see 
The greatest sight she iver saw since she left old Killkenny. 
There was Murphy's great big Tom Cat,who was as black as jet, 
Making love to Mrs. Finnegan's Puss and Miss O'Hara's Pet; 
There was Miss Fagan's pretty Maltese and Miss Malony'sTom, 
With twinty more upon the roof to have their midnight song; 
Bad luck to yez, says Mrs. 'Mulligan, but we'll put a 
stop to this, 
And see if our nights cannot be spent in quietude and bliss; 
So together we descended to get ready for the throng 
Of all our Neighbors' Pussy Cats, should they begin their song. 
We waited for an hour or more, and divil a 
sound did we hear, 
But a 
me'ow now and then from O'Brien's cat who lived back in 
the rear; 
And just as me eyes were closed for the balance of the night, 
Mrs. Mulligan gave a 
yell that set me all afright 
Saying, Pat, don't you hear the cats again, 0, murther, such a 
squall, 
That I 
hardly knew, whin I 
jumped up, that I 
was myself at all, 
So to the roof we wint again, prepared to make them fly, 
Mrs. Mulligan threw the broom at them, but it struck me in 
the eye. 
0, sez I, now Mrs. Mulligan, don't be taking me for a 
cat, 
But before I 
finished the sintence,another blow knocked me flat; 
I 
thin jumped up, excited, and began to yell wid pain, 
And went for Mrs. Mulligan for not taking better aim ; 
And the cats flew in all directions as they scampered out of sight, 
But Mrs. Mulligan made me sleep upon the roof that night ; 
So I'll move me board and lodging away from these French flats, 
And go to a 
dacent place to live where the neighbors don't 
keep cats.

Ireland's Shore. 
Composed by JOE A. 
BURGESS, and sung with immense success by Miss 
ANNIE BURGESS. Presented to FIELDS and HANSON. 
In a 
little cottage neatly built 
Upon old Ireland's shore, 
Where the shamrock and the thistle grows so free, 
Lives a 
colleen dear so sweet and fair 
Upon that isle so green, 
And her dear face now I 
often long to see. 
CHORUS. 
But she's far away from me across the deep blue sea, 
Could I 
but see her bright sweet face once more. 
And when we met as strangers, 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again; 
She's my darling treasure, 
Pride of Ireland's shore. 
Oh, my love for her has grown stronger 
Since we met on Erin's shore, 
And I 
long to see the land where I 
was born, 
And to tell the love that I 
have cherished 
All those years for her, 
And to hear her kind heart's answer in return. 
But she's far away, &c. 
I 
have seen the Isle so green, 
I've gained my fair colleen. 
Her love so pure is mine forevermore. 
And when we met as strangers 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again ; 
I've my darling treasure, pride of Ireland's shore. 
But she's far away, &c.

I 
LEFT IRELAND AND MY MOTHER BE-
CAUSE WE WERE POOR. 
Written for and Sung by Andy and Annie Hughes. 
(Copyright, by ANDY HUGHES.) 
There's a 
sweet spot in Ireland, that I 
long to see, 
It's my own native birth-place, and its heaven to me, 
Where my blessed old mother lived there all alone; 
With my brothers and sisters 'twas a 
bright happy home, 
We had'nt much money, but my old mother dear, 
Left a 
kiss on my brow and bade me heart have good cheer, 
And the shadows of poverty crossed on our door, 
I 
left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
I 
will never forget on that bright rosy morn, 
When old Ireland I 
left, how my poor heart did mourn, 
And my aged old mother said, be of good cheer, 
Farewell, farewell, Danny darling, good-bye. 
Mother and my brothers and sisters, took me by the hand, 
And bade me do right, when I 
left Ireland, 
And I 
bade them farewell, at our own cottage door; 
And left Ireland and my mother, because we were poor. 
Now, since leaving old Ireland, my poor mother is dead. 
God bless my dear son, were the last words she said ? 
And the ring that me father gave, she sent to me, 
It's a 
far dearer gem, than bright gold ere could be, 
But my brothers and sisters, sure I 
wish they were here, 
For I'm longing to see them, but they'll come never fear, 
We'll make a 
fine home on America's shore, 
Where happy we'll live, yes, although we be poor.

DOCKSTADER, and sung by them with great success 
at all the principal theatres.. 
Far over the sea from the Emerald Isle, 
Just twenty years ago, 
We sailed one day from Dublic bay— 
I'ts Ireland we came from, Na-ho 
They called us greenhorns when we came, 
But that's in days gone by, 
Now I'll wager there's not a 
couple can dance 
Like my old 
man 
and I. 
woman r 
CHORUS. 
For I'm forty-one next Friday week, 
And he's just forty-two, Na-ho! 
Sure a 
jollier couple you never have met 
Than Mr. and Mrs. McGrew. 
On the street when we meet the girls and the boys, 
They shout, Hey there, how de do ? 
Oh, don't they look neat from their head to their feet, 
Look at Mr. and Mrs. McGrew ! 
We've a 
boy and a 
girl that wears elegant clothes, 
At the theatre now they're engaged, 
And there's holes in the floor and no lock on the door 
Since the two of them went on the stage. 
For I'm forty-one, & c. 
Written, composed and sung by Wm. J. SCANLON, in SCANLON & CRONIN'S 
famous sketch, entitled " Life in a 
Tenement House." 
I've got a 
daughter I 
talk to all day, 
But the devil a 
word will she mind what I 
say, 
In spite of advice she'll go far away, 
Sometimes she cannot be found. 
If I 
say stay at home, begorra she'll get mad, 
She'll call me an ould tad, say I've got them bad, 
Inside of an oyster I 
ought to be clad, 
To a 
nannie goat I 
ought to be bound. 
CHORUS. 
Ah, but if I 
catch the man 
That taug,,t, her to dance 
The la-de-da dance, the tra,-le-la dance, 
On the top of his nose I'll make my fist prance, 
And twist off the bot'n of his legs, ha, ha 
;Repeat.) 
At night she'll put on her fol-de-lol-lols, 
Then she'll skip off to her picnics and balls, 
Then on the neighbors she'll make her grand calls, 
Borrow all the clothes that she can. 
For a 
bustle she'll wear my coderie pants, 
My chin-chilly vest, or anything by chance, 
But if I 
catch the lakidie-buck that taught her to dance, 
I'll twist off the both of ihis legs.

G. (
Bull Driver), 
President of the Bummers' Aid Rociety. 
No Bummer must eat more than one hot meat a

ations upon their character, by hinting that they can't drink 
much. 
No Bummer will refuse to drink when asked at any time, 
unless he receives a 
wink from the barman, denoting the be-
v!rage to be fourth-proof camphine, which is liable to affect 
the breath. 
No Bummer will be allowed to sit around the stove over 
fifteen minutes without drinking. 
The meetings of the Bummers are held nightly. 
Any Bum-
mer absenting himself will be fined a 
dozen drinks of " tangle 
foot whisky." 
No Bummer must get too drunk to drink every round, 
under forfeiture of his next morning's " eye-opener." 
No Bummer must leave the house until it is closed for the

[Note.—This rule will in all cases be rigidly enforced, as 
nothing will be allowed to affect the respectability of our su-
blime organization.] 
All played-out and indigent Bummers, having become un-
able to " stand up to the rack," will immediately proceed to 
the nearest cemetery and resign. 
No Bummer must so far forget his honorable position in 
the community as to ask the president to treat.

14 name Is, an 
The Day We Walked O'Leary 
Written by M. J. ENNIS and sung by BONIFACE and ENNIS, the funny 
Irish Comedians. 
Our name it is McCarty, we are six months in this country; 
When we reached New York there was great talk of O'Leary, 
the walking man, 
And as soon as ever we did land our friends they took us by 
the hand, 
And they said they'd back us while we could stand to walk 
the great O'Leary. 
They put us into training then, and off our backs rubbed all 
the skin, 
They made us run, walk, jump and swim, till our hearts were 
sick and sore ; 
Those training days we'll never forget, for they are fresh in 
our memory yet, 
For our undershirts were soaking wet the day we walked 
O'Leary. 
The day arrived—we went on the track, but O'Leary left us 
far behind, 
And then our friends began to growl and ask if we were blind, 
They told us that we sold the race, and that it was a 
great 
disgrace, 
And they nearly ate of us the face when we didn't beat 
O'Leary. 
Our defeat was all the talk, so we challenged him again to 
walk, 
We made up our minds we'd make no balk, but beat him sure 
this time ; 
Six days we stayed upon the track, to do our best we were 
bound to try, 
But they made us sing the " Sweet By and By" when we 
couldn't beat O'Leary. 
Of the gate-money we expected half, but O'Leary he gave us 
a 
laugh, 
And he said we had the cheek of a 
big giraffe to expect any-
thing like that. 
And our backers told us to take a 
rest, and for to take a 
trip 
out West, 
To wipe off our chin, and pull down our vest, and never walk 
O'Leary.

Written expressly for JAMES O'NEIL by ROBERT MCKAY. 
I 
AM a 
jovial Irish lad— 
Ever ready for a 
spree; 
A wake or fair, the divil may care— 
It's all the same to me. 
For wid a 
colleen by me side, 
A blackthorn in n

I

In dear ould Ireland. 
SPOKEN,—Yis, boys, I'm always in for a

The other day as I 
was walking up 
Broadway, I 
stoppe I 
in at a 
menagerie, an' while I 
was lookin' 
at the sea lion a 
man stepped up, and says he, " A 
quare ani-
mal. that ?" " Yis sur," says I, " what do they fade him on?') 
"Oh," says he, " he lives on suction." "Is that so?" says I. 
Ye see he was givin' me a " kid," thinkin' I 
was a 
greenhorn. 
`' That's so," says he, smilin' all over like a 
basket av chips, 
" 
Well, thin," says I, " he must be well kept, for be Heavens 
there's laity av suckers around l" an' I 
walked off singitf—

From the Green Isle on the sea.

Wherever I

I've only just come over, 
But make no mistake dye see, 
Although I've just come over 
Ye .;.. n't come over me.

Thin as I 
walked along the street, 
The boys at me did shout— 
"I'll have the coat!" " Pull down yer vest!" 
" 
Does yer mother know yer out ?" 
I 
stopped at wanst, and thin around 
Like bees they quickly flew, 
An' for an hour or more was ruz 
The divil's hulabaloo! 
SPOREN.—" Why don't ye shoot the hat ?" says one fellow, 
"Hould on," says I, " an' I'll shoot it for ye immagently," I 
took off me caubeen and put a 
ball through it at wanst. (I'm 
afeard it'll never recover.) " Pull down yer vest" says another, 
"I would," says I, " but me uncle' wanted it, an' so I 
lint it 
to him." " Don't give it away," was another's advice; " Divil 
a 
bit," says I, " I 
only lint it to him." '• Does yet mother know 
yer out?" remarked a 
cross-eyed chap with red hair; " Yis," 
says I, " she gave me her blessin' the da I 
came out to Amer-

Kate O'Brien is my name, 
I'll tell you boys from whence I

Old Ireland is the place I 
claim, 
And I'm an Irish girl. 
No Country is more dear to me, 
Than the little isle stands in the sea. 
Where boys and girls are gay and free, 
Deny it if you can. 
Sure old Ireland's the place, 
That there's fame for fun and mirth, 
Its equals you cannot find, 
And search all o'er the earth. 
Good-natured boys and girls there, 
With few of them you can compare, 
Their hearts and minds are free from care, 
That makes an Irish.man.

'Gainst all invaders who did intend

When on his trial he did attend, 
And made the noblest back to bend, 
To the honest Irishman. 
In the high court of justice, 
lie made them all to stare,

In Eighteen forty-eight gone by 
The Irishmen they had to fly, 
For famine stood in every eye 
Along old Grannia's shore; 
Thousands to America did sail 
Leaving their wives and babes to wail, 
They were determined they would not fail, 
But their hardships undergo. 
The Harp that once through Tara's Halls, 
Its cord shall strike again, 
And welcome back the exile 
From across the stormy main. 
May peace and plenty ever be, 
In that little isle stands in the sea, 
Then let the toast be Ireland free, 
And you'll all be happy men.

As sung by Mn 11,4 MORRIS, with Mae EVOY'S Hibgrniewas 
We're standing near our hearth again, 
But roof there's none above; 
The stars are weeping down their tears, 
In grief for us, my love ; 
And the cold is in my heart, Katrine, 
I've nothing now to cheer, 
For I 
cannot call the old times back,

Old Times," to Inc so dear. 
'Tis true the rent was growing up, 
Our bit of land was poor, 
And fever and the hunger came,

We did our best but soon the writ 
Was fastened at the door, 
They bade us leave the home we lov'd, 
The home we'll see no more. 
Oh! the cold is in my heart, Katrine! 
I've nothing now to cheer, 
For I 
cannot call the old times back; 
Old times to me so dear.

DAN.—Good avening, Cornalius. 
COR.—How are you, Dan McCarthy? 
DAN.—Where was you going the other day when I 
saw 
you up town ? 
COR.—I 
was going to the walking match. 
Sir John Astley 
sent me a 
letter by telegraph asking me to keep my eye on 
things for him. 
DAN.—Did you do as he asked you ? 
COR.—I 
tried to, but nearly got in a 
muss over it with the 
doorkeeper. 
He says to me: " You're in such a 
hurry, man 
(Harriman), people will think you're interested. 
DAN.—An' is (Ennis) that all the trouble you had ? 
COR.—Well, he made me feel kind of Leary before such a 
crowd. 
DAN.—(R) 0, well, you got off better than I 
did. 
I 
was 
arrested, and have been locked up ever since. 
COR.—Who arrested you ? 
DAN.—Captain Williams arrested me for assault and bat-
tery. 
He was going to Blake a 
man's jaw for interfering. 
COR.—Oh, oh; what did you do ? 
DAN.—He arrested me for striking a 
match. 
CoR.—I'm glad you're out, but I've been arrested myself, 
for mayhem. 
DAN.—That was a 
tough charge. 
How was it ? 
COR.—I was arrested for biting my nails. 
DAN.—How did you get out of it ? 
COR.—The judge told me that unless I 
got some minister 
or preacher who knew me to vouch for my character, he'd 
send me up to give sparring exhibitions with Joe Coburn ; so 
I 
sent for Senator Bob Hart, and he got me out right away. 
By the way, where have you. been ? 
59 
DAN.—Shure, man (Sherman), I've been to Washington to 
see the President. 
He's ( Hayes) a 
friend of mine. 
COR.—IIave you any influence ? 
I 
have an application in 
as watchman on the Elevated Road—watching the tracks to 
see that no dogs or cattle get on them. 
DAN.—Well, I 
have some influence, and can get you a 
good job. 
COR.—Can you ? 
What as ? 
DAN.—Up in the Park, inspector of goats! 
COR.—You're giving me a 
kid ? 
DAN.— No, I 
am not. 
You're stretching it, but it's a 
soft 
job. 
I 
can get your brother a 
job, too. 
Con.—What to do ? 
DAN.—Keeping the rest of your family from going to Sing 
Sing. 
COR.—You wouldn't do for a 
job like that, as all your 
family's there except yourself, and you'll follow them as soon 
as you get your trial. 
DAN.—You're too sharp. 
I 
see I 
cannot down you, al-
though you are a 
stranger in the city. 
Have you been around 
visiting the different places ? 
COR.—I have some. 
Do you know a 
good way for me to 
make a 
visit to Sing Sing? 
DAN.—I 
do. 
Go up Fifth avenue and steal diamond ear-
rings. 
COR.—I see you're full of it this evening. 
Do you know 
any jokes ? 
DAN.—I 
do, Tim Corneel, I 
do. 
COR.—Well, ask me some, Bunt. 
DAN.—Do you know the weight of a 
fool ? 
CoR.—I never saw you weighed, but I 
give it up. 
What 
is the weight of a 
fool? 
DAN.—A 
simpleton (simple ton). 
Co.— I'm afraid anybody buying you will get short weight, 
Well, let me ask you one. 
What makes a 
hog grunt? 
•MilD 
60 
DAN.—I 
don't know. 
There's no one touching you. 
COR.—Why is your mouth like the sounds of a 
dying man 
coming from a 
hospital ? 
DAN.—I 
give it up. 
Why is your mouth like the sounds of 
a 
dying man coming from a 
hospital ? 
COR.—Because the noise that comes from it makes the 
neople pity you. 
DAN.—I 
had you that time. 
Ha, ha, ha! 
Cou.—What are you laughing at ? 
DAN.—I 
am laughing at nothing.

great 
deal less.

FOREMEN ON TIIE ELEVATED ROAD. 
Here we are, two light-hearted Irishmen, 
We hold our heads as high as any in the land, 
We shun all Irish like Pat Rooney; we want you to un-
derstand 
We're foremen on the Elevated Road. 
Two dollars a 
day is all the pay we get, 
In our gang is Mike the Bite, alias the Weehawken Pet. 
We keep our men to work, and never let them set 
Like the foremen on the Elevated Road. 
CHORUS. 
Then give three hearty cheers for Cornalius and Dan, 
Who can warble a " Come all ye" like true-born Irishmen ; 
We like no interference when in charge of our gang, 
Do the foremen on the Elevated Road. 
Every morn at eight o'clock we get them all together, 
'Tis then we call the roll, in wet or shiny weather ; 
It makes but little difference—they're all as tough as 
leather, 
Are the laborers on the Elevated Road. 
At half-past five at night, ' tis then that we get done, 
To our wives and children home we very quickly run ; 
They say my boy is like his father—the little son of a 
gun, 
Oh, oh, we're proud foremen on the Elevated

A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. FisnEn's, 98 this 
sau street, called the " Little Flirt." We 
cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlem en 
readers, as 
we 
think 
it 
would 
only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining ' how, when and 
where to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the un-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "ilirting."1,7 ts . 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat 'Mile 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-flve cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operand/ of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents 
might afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend It to our young lady and gentlemen readers."

for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many of the an-
swers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

tourliu Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
to meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such P. way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by 
ritlemen who are either too diffi-
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. 
This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes a 
further explanation un-
necessary. 
The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties
