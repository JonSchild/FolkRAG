These gentlemen are natives of Providence, R. I., and 
firgt,bgan their professional career, at Pawtucket, R. I., 
making their first appearance with Forrest's Minstrels, in 
the above town, Apra", 12m, 1864. 
They began their labors at the bottom of the " ladder 
of fame," working dilligently and assiduously, surrnount-
ing many obstacles. 
They are the originals of their pres-
ent line of business, Sketches, Changes, &c., and stand at 
the head of their profession. . 
They - 
have played in all the (principal Cities of the 
United States and Qalifornia, where they have always been 
received with the greatest favor, and acknowledged by 
• press 'and public, as "par excellence." 
On the night of April 12th, 1875, they celebrated their 
ELt 
vzyr a 
ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR PARTNERSHIP. 
They are, at present, organizing a 
Monster Combination, 
to travel ,through the principal Cities of the East, West, 
North and South, to be known as TUE GREAT SHERIDiN 
;IlacK Coarmacanos, and will commence a 
Summer Sea-
son at Wood's Museum, N. Y., May 31st, 1875.

Sheridan & Mack's Grand Combination gave one of their 
inimitable entertainments at Ward's Opera House, last 
evening, to an audience crowding the Auditorium from, pit 
to dome, and we cAn safely say there is no Company trav-
elling that can equal it. 
From first to last it was a 
suc-
cession of new songs, acts and sketches, and the Artists 
3 
:4 
are all recognized as first-class. 
Sheridan and Mack are, 
of course, The Cards, and stand at the -head of all their 
many imitators. 
Their last new and original sketch, writ-
ten by J. F. Sheridan, is the best we have ever seen onthe 
Variety Stage, and they may well claim their superiority 
over all Lightning Change Artists. 
Their changes from old 
age to youth is so astounding, that one-half the audience 
will not believe there are not four persons portraying the 
characters. 
We bespeak for them crowded and fashiona-
ble audiences, during their limited stay among our eiti-
zens.—Portland Press. 
Within the past eighteen years but three Artists have ap-
peared on the New Orleans boards who have shown any 
comprehension of the physiology' of drunkenness, when 
that condition of physical and mental weakness fell into 
the line of their professional rank. 
Those Artists are Miss 
Lucille Western, Mr. John E. Owens and Mr. Bellville Ryan. 
This distinguished trio are transformed into a 
quartette, by 
adding to their roll, Mr. J. F. Sheridan, whose Owen Con-
nelly, in the sketch of Bad Whiskey, is so realistic a 
char-
acter actor as to excite the remark from an auditor, that 
the imitation of drunkenness was " too natural." 
In this 
sketch Mr. Sheridan exhibits a 
dramatic talent which we 
regret he has not more diffusely and seriously cultivated.— 
New Orlean3 Picayune. 
Sheridan and Mack's Grand Combination gave one of 
their superior parlor`enterhainments at the Academy of 
Music, last evening, before a 
very refined and crowded 
auditorium. 
One thing we noticed. 
The many ladies 
which honored the Managers by their presence. 
Unfor-
tunately, for the more meritorious Managers, Ladies hesi-
tate about attending a 
Variety entertainment, for the reel,-
son there are so many inferior and doubtful ones now trav-
elling, and diappointing those who do patronize them; 
but the high estimation ,and reputation of Messrs. SHERI-
DAN & M ACK was generously heralded through the columns 
of the press before they arrived, and the Ladies turned out 
in full force, and they were well repaid for their kindness. 
We predict, for the very strong Combination, a 
great suc-
cess here and elsewhere, and recommend them highly to 
our brethren of the press.—New Orleans Times.

THE GRAND OLD MISSISSIPPI. 
As sung by SHERMAN & MACK. 
Good evening to you, one and all; 
We have just come out to sing a 
little ditty; 
It is about those times has past and gone; 
How we used to work on the grand old Mississippi. 
Oh. the passengers they used to wink, 
And look at us so shy, 
Because we dance and do a 
break, 
And throw our legs so high ; 
But now we have sung our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grand old Mississippi. 
White folks, we can no longer stay, 
Or the folks will think that we have run away; 
But as soon as we reach the old plantation, 
Why a 
song and dance will be our occupation. 
Oh, the CAptain was as good a 
man 
As ever you did see ; 
He used to feed us on hoe-cake, 
And sometimes hominy; 
But now we are through our little ditty, 
We'll go back again to the grand old Mississippi.

PRETTY LITTLE JOE. 
Written by J. F. SHERIDAN. 
Sung by Fluivxm CASZT• 
While walking out the other day, 
Strolling up the street, 
Among the many passers-by 
Whom I 
chanced to meet, 
Was one of the fairest creatures 
That e'er saw the light of day, 
And as she tripped along by me 
My heart she stole away. 
C 
HORITS. 
Like a 
fairy, (symph) 
Blithe and airy, (symph) 
She tripped along so gracefully. 
As homeward she did go— 
lly fascinating, captivating, 
Pretty little Joe. 
As she went on I 
followed— 
She smiled and turned around, 
When suddenly I 
saw her drop 
A 
card upon the ground; 
I 
quickly picked the treasure up, 
Stood transfixed on the spot; 
Just then she hailed a 
passing car, 
And into it she got. 
Like a 
fairy, fix. 
As that car it passed from view, 
It really made me sad; 
But when I 
found I'd her address, 
I 
didn't feel so bad ; 
Now I'm resolved to call on her— 
To win her I 
will try; 
So, kind friends, for a 
little while, 
To you I'll say good-bye. 
Like a 
fairy, Zee.

PLAYING 1100KEY. 
Original with SHERIDAN ct MIca. 
WE'RE as happy, just as happy as can be, 
We're full of fun, my little Sue and me, 
We ran away from school to-day, 
And oh, we had such fun; 
Playing hookey from the school, 
I 
know is against the rule, 
But we don't care, when we got there, 
The school it was begun. 
CHORUS. 
I 
don't care, I 
don't care, 
Do you my little Sue, 
You know I 
don't, you know I 
don't, 
I'm happy when with you. 
(Repeat.) 
first we went and got some cherries in the !pond, 
And I'll bet you they tasted geed, 
And then we went down to the pond, 
And with the ducks did play; 
Then Jimmy climbed an apple tree 
And threw all the cherries down to me, 
But a 
great big dog he chased us, 
Oh, didn't he frighten me. 
I 
don't care, dm.

THERE'S some folks borrow trouble, 
And then they feel so blue, 
They go and throw themselves away, 
And don't know what to do; 
But we're a 
happy couple, 
Who don't make any fuss, 
And in this little song and dance, 
You can bet your stamps on us. 
CHORUS. 
Now don't you be a 
fool, 
But always take things cool, 
Jump 'round, break down, 
Twist your ankle thus, 
Don't you ever be afraid, 
To bet your stamps on us. 
There are some folks kind of airy, 
Who blow and talk quite loud, 
They would not notice common folks, 
They are so very proud; 
But let them blow and put on aim, 
You needu't care a 
cuss, 
For whether school it keeps or not, 
You can bet your stamps on us. 
Now don't you, (fee., 
To keep out of double trouble, 
As through this world you roam, 
Don't let trifles worry you, 
But take things as they come; 
Go right in, through thick and thin, 
If you get in any 1111ISS, 
Just drop a

You can bet your stamps on us.

The little dears can't help it., foe 
We put on lots of style. 
There was a 
dance the other nig:it, 
Of course now we were there, 
We put on all our nice clothes, 
And oiled and curled our hair; 
When the fiddle commenced to plar, 
Then we began to dance,

The nigs they all went crazy,— 
And the gals into a 
trance. 
CHORUi. 
Oh, we did it so neat, 
And looked so sweet. 
When we'd ask the gals to damn; 
They'd look at us and smile, 
We set the poor gals crazy, 
For we put on lots of style. 
Now white folks we must leave you, 
For we've other work to do, 
Some other time we'll come again, 
And sing and dance for you; 
We're going to another ball to-night, 
Now vsouldn't you like to come, 
We must fix up a

When we get there the gals will stare; 
And of course commence to smile, 
We'll set the poor gals crazy 
If we put on all our style.

GOOSE AND INGUNS. 
As sung by Sot, SmrrH RIISSELL. 
Oh, dear! I'm nearly starving,

want something nice to eat, 
I 
fancy myself carving; 
Big pies and joints of meat. 
Roast pork or leg of mutton, 
To me would be of use ; 
And though I'm not a 
glutton, 
Still, I'd polish off a 
goose! 
Cnonus. 
For it is my opinion, 
That stuffed with sage and ingtm., 
No bird that flies is half so nice, 
As a 
goose with sage and ingun. 
I'm very fond of Turkey, 
Spring Chicken is good to take; 
Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A 
dinner I 
could make. 
alike corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
toose! 
For it is my opinion, &o. 
I've liver tried, and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and fried; 
A 
sheep's-head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling, 
And fish-balls joy produce; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy, 
That appertains to goose

MY LOVE SHE IS A 
FAIRY QUEEN 
Sung by Miss ALICIA JOURDAN. 
My love she is a 
fairy queen— 
About her face no paint is seen; 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall ; 
Her ankle, too, so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat; 
Were I 
a 
bee upon her lip, 
I'd stay all day and sip, and sip. 
CHOEUS. 
Oh, she never flirts—she's no coquette; 
She never scolds, nor does she fret ; 
She's some on style, and full ot fun; 
" 
You bet your life," she's number one. 
I 
took her to a 
show ono night, 
I 
almost knew 'twould please her quite; 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say ; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose ; 
A 
man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love he gave a 
smile. 
Oh, she never flirts, dr,c. 
To see my love, next day I 
went— 
To pop the question was my intent ; 
Alas! poor me, I 
felt quite sore 
To hear she'd gone in a 
coach and four; 
Her mother squealed and I 
did squall; 
She'd took her trunk and waterfall; 
I 
seized my hat—to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with a 
circus man. 
Oh, she never flirtg, &c.

Don't Forget the Old Folks at Horne. 
Words and Music by J.

S EAN. 
For the young folks our song is intended, 
Them their duty we wish to remind ; 
We hope they will not be offended— 
'Tis said, with intentions most kind ; 
We know as they spring up from childhood. 
To strange, distant countries they roam, 
And seldom, if ever, a 
thought give 
To the old folks F 
0 
lonely at home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't forget the pt-or old folks at home; 
Remember the old folks at home; 
They nursed you with care— 
Your hardships did bear ; 
Don't forget the poor old folks at home. 
They protected and nursed, aye, and cared for 
You, when so fragile and weak; 
They watched with affection your first smile, 
And taught you to lisp and to speak; 
And now they in turn have grown helpless. 
Old age cruel traces have shown ; 
Is it right to refuse them assistance, 
And leave them forgotten, alone 
Don't forget, &c.

WHAT SHOULD MAKE THEE 
EAT, MY DARLING. 
As sung by SHERMAN & MACE. 
What should make thee -eat, my darling, 
Pork and beans and mutton stew, 
Ham and veal, and roasted turkey, 
Hearts and livers, kidneys too, 
Sour krout, sausages, and limburg, 
Eggs and oysters, bread and crust ? 
If you do not quit your gorging, 
Darling, you will surely bust. 
Beets and turnips you devour, _ove, 
Sweet potatoes take your eye, 
Cucumbers, cabbages and string-beans, love, 
Heavy on your stomach lie; 
Quail on toast and prairie chicken, 
Taste so lovely, so you say ; 
I 
should think so, for you eat, love, 
Sixteen good square meals a 
day. 
Pickled eels feet, stewed canaries, 
Pigs feet broiled in kerosene, 
Elephants stuffed with sarsaparilla, 
Donkeys' ears with pork and beans, 
Beeswax fried in black molasses, 
Oysters stuffed with Arctic whales, 
Or frogs in glue prepared in fine cut, 
Hoopskirts broiled on monkeys' tails.

THE SWELL OF THE DAY, 
Words and Music by J. P. 
SKELLY, 
Sung with great success, by Miss Amen. JOURD1N. 
I 
am a 
swell of the day—as you see— 
All other swells are but models of me; 
You must have heard of the name which I 
bear, 
Surely you must, for I'm known everywhere; 
Girls are enchanted when I 
am in view, 
Gents are bewildered, and gaze at Inc too ; 
Some criticise me and stare, while they say, 
" 
Oh, ain't he nobby, that swell of the day !" 
CHORUS. 
I 
am the swell of the day— 
That's what the people all say ; 
Go where I 
will, they say to me still, 
He's a 
genuine swell of the day. 
Now I 
confess I'm a 
little low down ; 
How can I 
help it, when all thro' the town, 
People are praying for times to improve ? 
Still I'm contented and keep on the incve— 
'Why should I 
grumble when care I 
have none ? 
All my delight is in fashion and fun; 
Friends crowd around me, and wine makes us gay, 
Then they all flatter the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell, &C. 
I 
am accomplished and very refined; 
Once I 
was rich, but my purse has declined; 
Love is a 
stranger, as yet, to my heart, 
But from the ladies I 
ne'tr can depart, 
They are the cause of my joy And despair ; 
None can resist them, so charming and fair; 
Some spooney fellows they drive to dismay, 
But they all cling to the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell, to.

Price 80 Gent. 
There's a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points direct to me; 
How the little spark is shining, 
From whomever can it be ? 
It gets brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray; 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CHORUS. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me; 
And send a 
loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me; 
And speed the loving message, 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me, 
Oh! superstitious dread, 
How many idle fancies, 
You conjure in my head; 
When those we love are abseht, 
How wantonly you play; 
Every shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark, &c. 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months, no more., 
Since a 
letter in the candle, • 
Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger, 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the same, 
how welcome it shall be. 
Bright spark, Sze.

A

In picturesque beauty, unique,

The Old Home Ain't What it Used to Be. 
By C. A. W RITE. 
OH, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the fiddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn; 
Great changes have come to the poor colored man, 
But this change makes hirn sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
No, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes ma sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
In the fields I've worked when I 
thought ' twas ;lard, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side, 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered now and o'er the world they roank 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the cid home, &e. 
Vow the old man would rather lived and died 
In the home where his children were born, 
)3ut when freedom came to the colored man, 
lie left the cotton-field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three score al...I ten, 
And he'll soon have to .ay down and die, 
Tet he hopes to go unto a 
better land,

IT GOES AGAINST THE GRAIN. 
As sung by Miss ALICIA JOUP.DAN. 
Words by HARRY HURTER. 
Music ty CHARLES COOTE, J . 
As we go thro' the whirl of life, 
However much we grumble, 
We must be always on the move, 
And often in a 
certain groove 
Of low estate—but small or great— 
We often get a 
tumble. 
And many things we have to do 
Which go against the grain. 
CHORUS. 
We take the cap and wear it, 
And though very slow to declare it, 
We have to " grin and bear it," 
But it goes against the grain. 
A 
young man courts a 
pretty girl, 
And fancies she adores him ; 
But when he thinks the game is won, 
With some one else away she'll run ; 
Of course, he'll swear he doesn't care, 
Although it nearly floors him, 
And all the while he seems to smile— 
It goes.agabast the grain. 
He'll fit the cap, &c. 
Old maids, who don't deny their age, 3 
Is something over thirty, 
May say they hate the sight of men, 
But still we find them now and then, 
At half a 
chance, return a 
glance, 
And some get gay and flirty; 
Which shows if they still single stay, 
It goes against the grain. 
They fit the cap, &a. 
The vile garroters, when they're caught, 
And that is none too often,' 
Are now rewarded with the cat; 
They very much object to that, 
And if some say it's not the way, 
Their brutal hearts to soften, 
It makes them yell, so we can tell, 
It goes against the grain. 
• 
But they fit the cap, &c. 
Since Nelson's day upon the sea, 
We've changed our style of fighting; 
Still the brave blue jacket lads, 
Cooped inside the iron clads, 
Are just as game and true of aim, 
When wrongs require a 
righting;1 
As every foe must know, although 
It goes against the grain. 
But they fit the cap, &o:

When we walk out the people shout, 
They like to see our fond affection 
And when they smile to see our style.

We almost blush through our complexion, 
We envy not the white folks,

Written and composed by Jons-le WILLIAM VICTORELLI, the great 
musical gymnasts, especially or SHERIDAN .31, MACK. 
SWELL SINGS.—WHILE walking out one evening, 
And strolling down Broadway, 
The moon was shining brightly, 
And everything looked gay; 
Just as I 
cast my eyes up, 
A 
lovely girl I 
saw, 
Standing at the counter, 
Of a 
fancy dry good's store. 
CHORUS. 
Her face it was bewitching, 
Here eyes they were so bright, 
My heart with love was bursting, 
I 
loved her at first sight. 
BEr.rx SINGS.—I'm here to keep my rill- 
mise, 
With a 
young man who last night 
Talked such strains of love to me, 
And squeezed my hand so tight, 
I 
hope he'll not deceive me, 
The clock has just struck nine, 
SWELL SINGS.—Oh, here I 
am my darling, 
And hope that I'm in time. 
Her face,

SWELL.—I 
need not tell you how I 
loved, 
Your pretty face at sight, 
And now to make me happy 
Just name the day so bright. 
BELLE.—Oh, your question is so sudden, 
I 
cannot just now say, 
But if you'll call and see mama, 
No doubt she'll name the day.

GOOD-EVENING friends, I 
hope you're well, 
To you a 
story I 
will tell, 
flow head and ears in love I 
fell, 
With a 
dashing, gay brunette. 
The first time that I 
met her 
She was riding in a 
car, 
A 
gentleman was with her, 
I 
think it was her pa; 
I 
arose, and said, " Will you accept my my sear 
She smiled, and thanked me 
iSrm.) With a 
smile so sweet, 
This dashing, gay brunette. 
We smiled and flirted as oniwe rode, 
I 
followed her to her abode, 
Into her hand I 
slipped a 
note, 
Asking if I 
might on her call. 
Next day I 
got an answer, 
It filled me with delight, 
Stating I 
might call 
The coming Sunday night. 
I 
read and read her letter o'er again, 
pu.) I 
thought -myself the happiest of men, 
Oh my dashing, gay brunette. 
At the appointed time I 
rang the bell, 
'Twas answered by my little Nell, 
Her blushing face at once did tell, 
Watching she had been for me. 
No longer could I 
conceal it, 
So I 
told her of my love, 
And vowed I 
would be true to her 
As the stars above. 
She said that she could love none else but me, 
Eit.) So next week I 
will married be 
To my dashing, gay brunette.

There's a 
circle of young men in this town. 
A 
merry set are we ; 
Our motto is, friendihip—purpose, fun ; 
We're happy, gay and free ; 
A 
cosy club-room we have got, 
In a 
fashionable street ; 
And two or three times every week 
The jolly boys there meet. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, assembled together we sit and talk over 
the topics of the day, and when I 
look around me and see 
a 
dozen of the bc.,st hearted fellows in the world. Fm really 
proud to say, that— 
Cnon-cs. 
I'm one of the boys, one of the boys— 
Always so happy when making a 
noise ; 
I'm one of the boys, one of the boys— 
I'm happy to say that I'm one of the boys.. 
Together we sit, and talk anl 
Music, laughter, song— 
It fills the air for squares around, 
But notl.' -lg e'er goes wrong ; 
Content we are to share alike 
Each other' cares and joys; 
Hand in hand, and true as steel, 
You'll find the jolly boys. 
57 
SPOKEN.—Yes ; if misfortune in any way befalls one of 
us, the others don't forget their unfortunate companion. 
Oh, no! for at his side, to cheer and comfort him in the 
hour of affliction, you'll find— 
One of the boys, &c. 
At billiards, rowing, base-ball, too, 
The boys are number one; 
In fact, in all the sports of life 
We're always in for fun; 
Invitations we receive 
To every fancy ball; 
Dressed up in style the boys you find 
Observed by one and all. 
SPOILEN.—Oh, there's nothing to compare with the pleas-
ure of a 
good round dance, when you have a 
pretty girl 
for a 
partner, and encircling the waist of the fairest in all 
the room, you'll be sure to find—

Why turn away when I

Why cold to-day? once I 
was dear; 
Then thy heart Stirred, and flushed thy brow; 
Never a 
word comes to me now— 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine ; 
Once its replies spoke love divine ; 
Cold as if we never had met ; 
Can it then be heartig can forget ? 
Cnoaus. 
Speak to me; speak— 
Be my heart heard, or it will break 
For one kind word; 
No vows to bind, no pledge I 
seek, 
Only be kind—speak to me, speak. 
One idle day thou did'st deplore 
Some castaway on desert shore ; 
'Twas but a 
tale by poet feigned. 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan, sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone by the bleak sea ; 
My life is drear, I, cast away— 
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day. 
Speak to me, 8ce.

GOING TO THE RACES.,

In a

We're dashing to the races in a

Oh ! that's the stylish way ! 
We pass them all upon the street,

And stop at each hotel to treat, 
For we've the stamps to pay!

And then we bet to win. 
The girls all stare as we go by; 
Oh ! that's the style for us, they cry, 
As past the 'nettled borses 
While thus, we hold them in! 
SPoKEN.—Whoa! Steady there! what are 3.-er bout! Gee

On the " favorite," my lads, we'll take our stand, 
And go you ten to one!

With nags and jockeys " on the brain," 
And drinking healths in bright champagne,

To those who have never perused the sad story of CHAR,. 
!ATTE TEMPLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sym-' 
pathized and wept with her in her sorrows, and glowed 
with indignation at the wrongs which she suffered from 
base, calculating villains, an opportunity is afforded of 
reading one of the most absorbing works ever written, 
proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfor-
tunate Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her inind 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah! the cruel spider came—" 
'This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords n 
striking example that vice, however prosperous in the be-
ginning, in the end leads only to misery and shame."

THE DAUGHTER OF CHARLOTTE TEMPLE. 
No one who has read the touching account of the 
misfortunes of Charlotte Temple, with that absorb-
ing interest which is inseparable nom 'Mrs. Row-
son's writings, can rest satisfied while denying them-
selves a 
perusal ef the life of Charlotte 'Temple's 
Daughter, Lucy Templz. 
It is a 
sequel possessed of all the thrilling in-
terest that characterizes the life of the -smfertunate 
mother, while it exemplifies in a 
wonderful manner 
" 
the visitation of the sins of the parents upon the 
children." 
It depicts sorrows that refuse the balm of sym-
pathy, and consolations which those arcund us 
" 
can neither give nor take away." 
It contrasts in 
living colors the ricIest fruits of virtue and happi-
ness on the one hand, and the bitter end, blighting 
disappointments and rair resulting from once yield-
ing to the seductive influence of passion. 
It points a 
moral that commends it to the atten-
tion of all, and is pervaded by an interest that will 
hold the reader in rape attention to the end.

A 
little book has 1..tely appeared in print at Messrs. Defier & 
Denison's, 98 Nassa- street, called " The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
!MY that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
Ps we think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting.' 
unfortunately there is enough of it done without any Zurther necie3 
fifty of explaining ' how, when and where to do it,' and this little 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorrupted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. '
Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing\ 
25 cents, ealled "The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all cbjec-
ttonable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to ou1, 
young lady and gentlemen readers.

THE APPRENTICE, 
on 
First Book for Mechanics, Machinists & Engineers 
By OLIVER BYRNE. 
12mo., cloth. $ 1.50. 
ENDORSEMENTS OF THE PRESS. 
The highest praise which can be given to this excellent 
elementary work on practical mechanics, consists in the fol-
lowing simple statement of facts; The editor of this journal, 
while teaching natural philosophy and chemistry in the 
Cooper Institute from 1859 to 1864, was in need of a 
text-
book of practical mechanics, adapted to the advanced classes 
who had been trained in mathematics; in his search among 
the many mechanical text- books, there was not one which so 
fully answered his requirements as the above work. 
It was 
therefore adopted and used with perfect satisfaction, and it 
is with pleasure that he receives it now as an old friend from 
the publishers, gives it his most earnest recommendation, 
and wishes it in the hands of all who are still in the fog about 
the units of work, calculation of the power of machinery, 
resistance to motion, strain on material, etc.-1/
anufacturer 
and Builder, July, 1874. 
frhe author of this work is well known as an extensive 
wiiter who has made some valuable additions to American 
technical literature, enumerated above in detail. 
The work 
we are now noticing is a 
theoretical treatise on practical me-
chanics, designed to supply a 
recognized deficiency. 
Most 
of the works on mechanics treat the subject in a 
manner 
which is not available to young men commencing n3 appren-
tices in shops. 
Any young than with a 
fair kw ge of 
arithmetic may, however, use this work to great advantage ; 
it is not only suitable for a 
text-book, but also as a 
work 
of reference. 
Most ambitious young men will make them-
selves so familiar with its contents as to be atle ' to refer 
readily to any portion of the book. 
The author has adopted 
a 
new notation to distinguish units of work from other units, 
which is not without value, and might be advantageously 
introduced into more ambitious works. 
The book is well 
printed on good white paper, and bound in still 'cloth covers.
