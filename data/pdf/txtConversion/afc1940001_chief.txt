Chief Bright SkyIn autumn when evening was spreadingHer pinions of darkness o'er all,In numbers
the Indians came treadingApproaching Niagara Falls.For the love of tradition had taught themThat
one of their tribe every year,At the cast of lot should be chosenTo pass down the falls without
fear.The chieftain had only one daughter;He loved her as loved he his life.Possessing the braveness
he taught her,She fears naught though costing her life.They thought that the chieftain would
surelyHave them to cast lots o'er once more;But nothing unfair did he claim her;She left them and
marched up to shore.A coffin, a canoe and a paddleLie waiting for her to step in.Long farewell
to pony and saddle,Long farewell to forest and kin.And just as the moonbeams was sparklingTo
gather her in its bright beams,She quickly pushed out her boat light,And silently rowed down the
stream.Now out from the banks of the river,A boat was seen skimming the tide.Oh, see how he loves
his daughter;He take of his place by her side.But one weeps alone in the moonlight;On the night
comes a pitying cryFrom a mother who make her heart quiverFor daughter and Chieftain Bright Sky.
