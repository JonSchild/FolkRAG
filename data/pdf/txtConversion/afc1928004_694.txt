scenes of de r 
Erin arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of Ireland's happy days, 
When as a 
nation she stood ti st upon the earth 
But alas ! all now is changed in the land of my birth. 
Yet I 
hold an emblrm as pure and bright as gold. 
And you will say that it is true when my story I 
have 
told, 
How I 
guard this treasure when my heart is sad and 
This small shamrock I 
plucked from Erin's shore. 
CF10111 B. 
Only a 
shamrock from that little isle so green, 
Emblem of truth and love its beauty can be seen, 
Some misconstrue it, while others it adore, 
Tbi shamrock I 
plucked. from Erin's shore. 
Sad memory bringing its troubles to my brow, 
_ . 
When I 
think of Erin and the way she's treated now, 
By a tyrant's hand she's dragged down in the mire, 
Is not that enough to rouse our patriotic fire ? 
I 
have still left to me my love for Irish soil, 
They cannot make Inc forget that dear sweet little isle, 
And while life does remain I'll cherish evermore, 
hi g 
small shamrock I 
pincked from Erin's shore.

Fancy Little Step. 
Perto"me I 
by the one-legged team, the harper Brothers. 
Oh ! we've come out to tell about 
A 
little love affair; 
That occurred to us as we walked out 
To take the evening air. 
About a 
girl we chanced to rued, 
Such charms 1 
can't forget, 
Our admiration was bestowed 
Upon a 
fancy little step. 
CECORUS. 
So easily and Co gracefully she did glide, 
For this little fairy I 
could have died, 
IIer head was bending low, 
As she gracefully on did go, 
With a 
pair of silver tas!3els on her high heeled boots, 
And her fancy little step. 
I 
stepped up to this pretty maid's side. 
And I 
offered her my arm, 
She smilingly acce ted it, 
Not thinking any harm. 
And as we strolled my love I 
told, 
I 
wanted her to be my wife, 
She said she would and soon she'll be 
My dearest—yes— for life.

Ole Zip Eliza. 
As sung by the Harper Brothers, 
Oh! I 
lived in the country, 
I 
fell down in the well, 
A 
snake crawled up my trousers, 
Didn't he give my old leg —. 
Hallelujah, old Zip 'Liza coon. 
George Washington was a 
great man, 
A 
lie he'd nev;r tell, 
But when he got that hatchet 
Didn't he give that cherry tree — 
The great prize fight is over, 
And that you all know well, 
Paddy Ryan clone the best he could, 
But Sullivan gave him —. 
There's a 
hundred verses to our song, 
And you bet we sing them well, 
But before we sing you any more, 
We'll see you all in —,

Coming Home. 
composed and sung only by Tom HARPER, the only one-legged song 
and dance artist. 
I 
was born in America, where the fields of cotton grow, 
And the sugar cane, the sweetest in the land, 
Where the girls are always good, and the boys are true and 
brave, 
And when I 
meet them I 
feel grand. 
I 
have traveled o'er the land, 
Many times my heart's been sad, 
But I've tried to make the most 
Of the good old times I've had. 
But the years are going fast, 
And I 
couldn't longer roam, 
And so you see Tom Harper's 
Come back home. 
Then get up early in thc morn, 
I 
am coming, coming 
Ring the bells and blow tne horn, 
Let me hear the mu 
lay. 
Tell the good folks one ai.d all, 
I 
am coming, coming, 
For I 
am so happy that I 
sir all day. 
Now, I 
have been to Ireland, where the shamrock grows 
greens 
And they gave to me a 
welcome hand, 
For they love America, does the gem of the sea, 
The reception that they gave me, it was grand. 
Then I 
went to Germany, likewise to sunny France, 
And how they all did shout when they saw me sing and 
dance,

And sung with great success by IlAtirsit & STANSILL, 
Air—"Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane. 
WHEN 
the war it first broke on', Oh (len we run away ! 
And joined the ranks of General Sherman true, 
And with the white folks dar we fought and lost our legs 
In protecting the red, the white and blue ; 
But now we have come home find everything has changed, 
Old Massa and old Missus gone to rest; 
But old Massa always taught us to try and do what's right, 
And protect the flag he loved the best. 
CIIORUS. 
But now we have come find everything is changed, 
And we too soon will pass away to rest; 
But we shall never forget our dear old Southern home 
Where we fought for the flag we love the best. 
We ever shall remem ber what old Master told to us 
Of that nobleman whose known both near and far; 
Who fought for liberty and proved himself to be 
A 
hero in peace and in war, 
We mean that noble man brave General Washington, 
Whom all true sons of freedom will ever bless, 
He gained our independence and made a 
nation free, 
And this is the flag he loved the best. 
But now we have come home. etc.

Old Man song and dance, as performed by the original one-legged song 
and dance artist, Mr. To H ARPER. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by A. J. FIEFIEB, 24 Vesey Street, N. Y. 
Oh, its more than forty years ago, 
But I 
remember well, 
When I 
was a 
nigger dandy beau, 
And courted Dinah Bell. 
I 
saw her milking a 
brindle cow, 
Beneath a 
shady tree, 
And I 
am just as fond of my Dinah now, 
Although I 
am sixty-three. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, I'm sixty-three, and it seems to me, 
I'm just as young as I 
used so be, 
Though I 
like my pipe and my glass d'ye see ? 
And the seat in the chimney corner. 
Oh, my wife will talk of the wedding now, 
And the days when we were young, 
For she's just as well, she'll often vow 
As when the bells were rung, 
She loves to sing. for she knows the ring 
Of her voice is sweet to me, 
And I 
can dance, and I 
like the chance, 
Although I 
am sixty-three. 
(Chorus).

1_ 
Old man, what is the matter, what makes you look so blue? 
Is it anything that this little girl has said or done to you ? 
If so, I 
feel so sorry, to make you look so sad, 
And if you have come home again, I'm sure you should 
be glad. 
HE. 
Oh no, my child, it's nothing you've said or done to me. 
But I'm all alone in this world, without friend or family; 
And now I've nothing left me but for to pine and sigh, 
And hunt me out a 
resting place to lay me down and die. 
SHE. 
I'm sure you oughtn't to feel so, for I'm an orphan too, 
My father's gone for a 
soldier and donn'd the army blue ? 
I 
suppose that he is dead, for we've never receiv'd a 
line, 
And I 
know that he is in his grave way down in Caroline. 
IlL 
It's now about ten years ago I 
left old Amity Sue; 
I 
ran away for a 
soldier, put on the army blue; 
I 
left here my dear old wife, and Susan was her name, 
laid now I 
find that she is dead, I 
wish that I 
were the 
same,

SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and composed by TOM HARPER, the original ONE LEGGED 
SONG AND DANCE MAN. 
On the banks of the river Ohio, 
In a 
quiet flowing glade, 
Where the soft and gentle river flows 
In sunshine and in shade ; 
It was there I 
saw a 
maiden fair, 
Eyes jet and breast like snow, 
And in meeting her has caused me great despair--
Down by the Ohio. 
Beneath the trees she lay reclining (Break.) 
Her two bright eyes like stars were shining (Break.) 
CHORUS. 
And as I 
gazed upon her form, 
I 
lost my heart, you know; 
I 
won't forget the girl I 
met 
Down by the Ohio. 
I took courage to kiss her little hand, 
When she started like a 
fawn', 
And blushed like the rose of early morn 
That spreads all o'er the dawn. 
I 
said and would she be mine, 
She slowly answered, " No," 
And left me standing all alone 
Down by the Ohio. 
And as I 
gazed, Ste.

Kind friends, if you will listen, 
A song to you I 
will sing. 
It's of that great country, 
Where my father was king. 
It's of dear old Ireland, 
Where the shamrock grows green, 
And the boys and the girls, sure, 
Are the bravest ever seen. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm singing and dancing 
From morning ' till night, 
I'm a 
gay Irish lad, 
And full of delight. 
The girls, the dear creatures, 
Do all of them swear 
They're in love with Prince Patrick,) 
The pride of Kildare. 
You've heard of my fathers, 
In days that are passed, 
Were famous for fighting, 
And never were surpassed. 
And I'm their descendant, 
And this you'll agree, 
For a 
true Irish prince, 
Plaise behold oue in me.

Who stole my heart away; 
Her eyes are bright as stars at night, 
So lively and so gay. 
We met ' twas in a

Where berries sweet do grow; 
'Twas there we plighted both our lote.s, 
And I 
named her my June Rose. 
For she's just as pretty as a 
bouquet of 
That in the garden grows; 
And she has promised to be mine, 
My lovely sweet June Rose. 
We often meet each pleasant eve, 
And wander through the grove; 
And while the moon is beaming brighl 
We whisper then our love.

And though we're rivals as you see, 
And she may love him and not love me,

SHINE YOUR BOOTS? 
Written by Tom HARPER. 
Sung by the LA 
VERDES. 
Dedicated to the Boot-blacks of New York. 
I'm a 
boot-black, here, in this City, 
And I've come to sing a 
ditty, 
Hoping it will excite your pity 
For the boot-blacks throughout our glorious land; 
You'll find that they are honest blades, Sir, 
And of hard work not afraid. Sir, 
Although they're in the boot- black trade, Sir ; 
So give to them a 
helping hand. 
Cnonus. 
Shine ! shine ! shine your boots, 
In a 
style that surely suits ; 
If you'll only shine your boots with mo, Siry 
You'll find that I'm an honest blade, 
And of hard work not afraid, 
Although I'm in the boot black trade— 
As you can plainly see, Sir. 
We know we often look seedy, 
But it's only when we are needy ; 
And with each other we are never greedy, 
But always try to do the best we can. 
How many men in our mighty Nation, 
Who are holding, now, a 
higher station, 
Have risen from an humbler occupation 
Than blacking boots, throughout the land. 
Shine! Shine I 
tt.c. 
Now, boys, there comes a 
peeler, 
I 
know him well, for he's a 
squealer! 
He'd tell the Judge, up town, that you're a stealer, 
So I 
must hurry and finish up my song. 
He tells me to move off his beat, Sir, 
And he kicks me out into the street. Sir ; 
Why can't he me with kindness treat, Sir, 
For, surely, I 
do nothing wrong. 
Shine! Shine!

What, in this world, can a 
little boy do ? 
Shoeless—supperless—miserable, am I—

Come buy ? come buy a

Here's a

And a

And you'll keep starvation away from my door. 
To-night, in the snow, I 
cOuld lay me down 
And die there, for nothing I 
meet with but frowns ; 
Forced to go hungry, day after day, 
Oh! Heaven, have pity on me I 
pray ! 
And give to us all a 
plenty to-night ; 
And keep my heart pure, that I 
may do right; 
Freezing— starving—miserable, am I, 
For I

Come buy, 390.

IT SUITS POOR PAT. 
Written by Tom HARPER. 
Respectfully dedicated to my 
friend Mn. PAT ROONEY. 
Oh ! my name it is Pat Rooney, 
And from Ireland I 
came ; 
Yes, I've lately emigrated from 
That little Isle so green ; 
To tell you what I 
like the best, 
So listen while I 
sing, 
I'll tell ye of a 
dainty dish, 
That's fit for any king. 
CHORUS. 
Then move not, speak not, until I 
do get through, 
I 
will spake out my mind, and tell you what is true ; 
You may talk about your cabbages, your turnips, and all 
that, 
But I 
love the Irish praties, for they suit poor Pat! 
Some likes 'em biled, with the skins left on, 
And others, in a 
stew ; 
But I 
like them best of all, my friend, 
When they are young and news; 
Junt give to me a 
dozen or so. 
Most any time of day, 
And I'll show you how an Irishman 
With them will get away. 
Then move not, &e. 
Now you may like biled oysters, 
And others, quail on toast, 
And some they like good pork and beans, 
And others a 
good beef roast; 
Well you can take them all, my boys, 
In welcome, too, at that ; 
But leave to me the praties, for 
They always suit poor Pat! 
Then move not, &v.

LITTLE NELLY RAY, 
I 
LOVE a 
little country queen, a 
village beauty rare, 
With rosy cheeks and pearly teeth, and lovely nut-brown hair; 
Her waist it is so slender, and her feet they are so small, 
Of all the girls I 
ever loved my Nelly beats them all. 
ClICRUS. 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, charming little Nell, 
Nelly Ray, Nelly Ray, pretty little belle; 
Nelly Ray like birds ot May, singing all the day, 
I 
never had a 
sweetheart like my charming Nelly Ray. 
Her father keeps a 
farmhouse, in a 
village down in Kent, 
And being on my holidays, to spend them there I 
went; 
And while a 
strolling through the fields, as on my way I 
roamed, 
It's there I 
met my Nelly, as she drove the cattle home. 
Nel13-,' 
Ray, dr,c. 
I 
took my Nelly for a 
walk, among the bright green grass. 
And words of love I 
whispered to this young country lass, 
T 
placed my arms around her waist, as I 
sat by her side, 
And while we were a 
talking she pledged to be my bride, 
Nelly Ray, dr,c. 
And now we've named the happy day, and how happy we 
shall be, 
No thoughts of jealousy shall enter the minds of her or me; 
But in our farm-house we'll be happy night and day, 
And our lives shall pass like sunshine, for I 
have the brightest 
ray. 
Nelly Ray, Ice.

Good-Bye, Lovel3i Lou. 
Written and sung by Gus WILLIAMS, the greatest of all 'vocalists, with 
tremendous success. 
Copyright, 1879, by Louis P. GOULLARD. 
'Twas early in the month of May, 
. 
I 
said to my girl Lou; 
As I 
am going far away, 
I'm going to ask if you 
Will constant be while I'm at sea, 
She bowed her lovely head. 
Then placed her tiny hands in mine, 
And I 
to her then said, 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea, and I 
will think of you. 
Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye lovely Lou, 
Think of me when I'm at sea and I 
will thin1- 
of yon. 
She said, to you I 
will be true, 
To do the same I 
ought; 
Tho' I 
am told you sailors 
Have a 
wife in every port. 
I 
said, " Now Lou don't look so blue, 
Or think me so unkind, 
I 
never could forget 
The girl I 
left behind." 
Good-bye, &c. 
I've one thing, Lou, to tell to you, 
Before the seas I 
roam, 
And that is of the presents 
I 
am going to bring you home. 
An Indian shawl, a 
parasol, 
A 
tiny kangaroo; 
A monkey and a 
parrot, yes, 
And they are all for you. 
Good-bye, &c. 
I 
bid adieu to lovely Lou, 
We parted on the shore, 
And something seemed to tell me 
I 
should never see her More, 
When I 
returned I 
quickly learned, 
, 
That she had gone away; 
Sci pow as Lou has proved untrue ;

SHE TOSSED HER CURLS AT ME, 
Song and Dance as performed by HARPER A:. STAssu.L. 
TWAS a 
Saturday afternoon, as down the street I 
went, 
I 
passed a 
damsel who was fair; 
And as she glided by, I 
was stifled by the scent 
That came from her glossy, curly hair. 
She wore. a 
gaiter boot, the size was number three, 
Which attracted my attention for awhile; 
And. when she saw me looking, she tossed her curls at me,. 
And also cast a 
most bewitching smile. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she tossed her curls at me in a 
manner that was free, 
Did this pretty little damsel so fair. 
I 
shall ne'er forget that foot, nor that natty little boot, 
Belonging to the girl with the glossy hair. 
I 
watched her around the corner, 'till he was out of sight, 
Then waited near the crossing for a 
car; 
xl when I 
took my seat, I 
noticed to the right 
le little one conversing with her pa. 
ew she had been shopping, by the bundles that she had, 
)t what they contained I 
could'nt see; 
when she reached her home, she passed them to her pa, 
nen with a 
smile, she tossed her curls at me. 
Yes, she tossed hor curls, vic.

Price 30 cents. 
I've wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain, 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the good old days are passed and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields, 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
My master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray, 
Oh, let me see that good old home, 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, eta. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land, 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again.

Charming Little Lu. 
Sung only as a 
Song and Dance by Fianits Swam 
'Twas at a 
fancy ball at St. James' Hall, 
With the prettiest fellow in the nation, 
I 
at once did go, thinking there to show 
My dancing skill, and gain his approbation, 
But, strange to say, I 
dared not dance, 
Nor could I 
leave my seat, 
nough poor dear Gussy came to me, 
And thus he did entreat: 
CHORUS. 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
In the mazy polka and the lanciers? 
Charming little Lu, may I 
dance with you, 
And mingle with the merry, merry dancers ? 
When we left the hall, I 
then told him all 
Of my sad determination, 
And, like all the rest, I 
did try my best 
To keel) down all his rash indignation. 
My hair-pins gone, my braids were loose, 
To dance I 
did not dare ; 
My chignon surely would come off, 
And make the people stare, 
SPOKEN.—Of 
course when I 
informed Gussy, dear, that I 
was liable to lose all my back hair if I 
danced, he could not 
do otherwise than say—

ECCENTRIC SONG AND DANCE. 
Composed by JAMES R. 
WALSH. Performed by WALsti and KING. 
Here we are two lively mokes, 
Two genuine southern mokes, 
We came from way down south in Tennessee 
It was there we worked all day 
In the cotton fields so gay, 
'Till old massa went and set us darkies free. 
CHORUS. 
Oh the high times on the old plantation 
We will not forget where'er we go, 
As our hearts are feeling light, 
We have come out here to night, 
On purpose for to let you white folks know. 
When our work was o'er at night 
And the moon was shining bright, 
We'd sit beneath the porch above the door, 
With the bones and tambourine; 
Then we darkies could be seen, 
While we'd break it down upon the kitchen floor. 
Oh the high times, &c.

On a

And to your hone you retire, 
What a 
pleasure it is to have a 
bright bouncing boy, 
Ono whom you love to admire; 
You hug him, and kiss him, you press him to your heart, 
What joy to your bosom ' mill bring; 
Then you place him on the carpet, 
And you'll hide behind the chair, 
And to please him you'll commence to sing:

When the sunshine of youth fades, and age bends us low,—

Then the smiles of our children ever brighten the path,

Will beam like a 
rain-bow in spring; 
By the fire-side at night, 
With our hearts so free and light, 
We will listen while our children sing:

And it fill'd my heart wall misery and woe. 
Dey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a

Oh, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart. 
In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days.

Dey never come again, let us give our praise to Him, 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So eY'ry night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slaiery days. 
Still my mem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dear old cabin floor, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; [bark, 
At night, when all was dark, we would hear de watch-dog 
And we'd listen to de murmur of de wind. 
It seem to say to me, " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd ! 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not

In dem agonizing, cruel slay'ry days. 
I 
am very old and feeble, and our life am nearly done, 
I 
have travel'd in the roughest kind of road; [ last, 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, I

Forget now and forgive, has always been my guide, 
For clat's what de golden Scripture surely says; 
But our mem'ry will turn roun, when our souls day we

THE BANKS OF THE POTOMAC. 
Written by EDWARD HARRIGAN, and sung by him in his beauti-
ful sketch of " The Blue and the Gray." 
On the banks of the Potomac, 
I 
am lonely here to-night, 
Sure I'm waiting for the enemy 
To come out here and fight; 
A.rrah, when this war is over, 
Oh, I 
will bless the day, 
Let me be dead or living, 
I'd praise America. 
But sure I 
can't help thinking 
Of the girl I 
left behind, 
A 
rosy Irish lassie, 
So loving and so kind; 
My dear old grey-haired mother, 
I 
left there all alone, 
I'd feel like young Napoleon, 
When I 
go marching home. 
Oh, a 
soldier's life is tedious, 
When he's laying loose in camp, 
We never have excitement 
Unless we're on a 
tramp; 
A 
short life and a 
merry one, 
Is generally our lot, 
Till we get our life-long furlough, 
From the enemy's heavy shot.

Sung with succees by James O'Nsti. 
The Land League Band turned out last night, 
With un forms of blue and white, 
Their instruments were shining bright, 
The greatest in the land. 
We 11 ve climbed the ladder of Fame, 
On the top wrung cut our name, 
And in fancy letters do tiame 
The Laud League String and Brass Band. 
We marched along upon Sixth Avenue, 
We phlyed the tunes that everybody knew, 
The music it was sweet and each note so true, 
And showed just what the Land League Band could do. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! the ladies and the babies that live on the street, 
Applaud with their baud and keep time wi h 
their feet, 
All the folks at their supper get up from their seat, 
And run to the door when they bear the drums beat, 
Come all you jolly sailor boys and listen unto me, 
While I 
relate a 
dreadful fate that happened on the sea, 
It's of a 
jolly sailor boy, by name Jack Donohue, 
For twenty years before the mast on board the Bugaboo. 
At every party in the town, 
Where all the spielers can be found, 
Wherever they are we're always around 
To show what we can do. 
We went to Brady's house last night, 
The bass horn player put out the light, 
Which nearly ended in a 
fight, 
But was stopped by the Laud League Band. 
Maloney he got drunk on lemonade; 
To walk home Mary Grogan was afraid, 
And the divil a 
one of lig knew the tune we-played. 
And Wiling drunk till daylight there we stayed,

O'er the grassy mound, 
There old massa is a 
sleeping, 
Sleeping in the cold, cold ground. 
CHORUS. 
Down in the corn-field 
Hear that mournful sound; 
All the darkies are a 
weeping— 
Massa's in the cold, cold ground. 
When the autumn leaves were falling, 
When the days were cold, 
'Twas hard to hear old massa calling, 
Cause he was so weak and old. 
Now the orange tree is blooming 
On the sandy shore, 
Now the summer days are coming, 
Massa never calls no more. 
Down in the corn-,field, Sao 
Massa made the darkies love him, 
He always was so kind, 
Now they sadly weep above him, 
Mourning, for he leave them behind.

Oat fancy brings a 
thought to me 
Of flowers sweet and rare, 
With grace and beauty there combined, 
And brightest hues so fair— 
So like a 
maiden that I 
loved— 
It was my happy lot: 
I 
whispered when we parted last— 
" 
011 I 
you'll forget me not/ " 
CHORUS. 
Graceful and as charming as a 
lily in the pond— 
Time has passed so swiftly—for, of her I 
am so fond—, 
Dasies and the roses, too, they grow around the spot 
Where we parted and I 
whispered— 
" 
You'll forget me not! " 
(Dance.) 
We met—I 
really don't know where— 
But still 'tis all the same— 
For love walks in the busy streets 
As well as in the lane: 
I 
gently pressed her tiny hand: 
She glanced at me a 
shot— 
She dropped a 
flower, I 
picked it up— 
A 
sweet forget-me-not 1 
(Chorus and Dance.) 
At last there came a 
happy day 
And something that I 
said 
Just caused her lips to murmur " vest" 
And shortly we were wed. 
A 
little cottage by the brook, 
And a 
tiny garden spot 
Where grows a 
little flower called— 
.A. sweet forget-me-not /

America the Land of the Free! 
Written and sung by MR. Tom FIARPRR. 
Respectfnlly dedicated to the Veterans of the 69th New 'Tort 
Regiment Volunteers. 
Oh ! I've lately come from America, the land of the brave 
and free ! 
Wh, ,re peace and plenty now does reign ; 
And an Irishman, there,. is as good as any one, 
Although he may be a 
little green. 
Wtien first I 
crossed the water and landed on their shore, 
They extended then, to me, a 
welcome hand ; 
And they said. you're welcome here, your country to us is 
dear, 
And we love you, the Irishman. 
CHORUS. 
Then hurrah for America, the land of the free! 
Sure that's the place, my boys, where there is no 
slavery. 
Oh! I 
had not been there very long when a 
war broke out, 
And spread its desolation over the land ; 
When they called upon the Irishman to help go and fight, 
I 
gave to them, then, a 
helping hand ; 
I 
enlisted in the ranks with- many a 
noble man, 
Along with brave Corcoran and his noble crew ! 
And they marched us down South to whit they call Dixie's 
land, 
To tight for the Red, White and Blue! 
Then hurrah for America, k.c. 
There is a 
nation that's been trying to cause America 
trouble. 
Of course, I 
mean the country called Spain! 
But she'd better mind her business or she soon will see, 
What is her loss will be America's gain; 
For with Cuba annexed unto the United States, 
We'll add to their banner another star ; 
Iind I 
hope that Ireland soon will, like America, be free! 
And you bet, the time is not so very far. 
Then hurrah for America, ct c.

With naught to disturb it but the duster or broom.

Eighty years she had sat in that chair grim and tall, 
In that old wooden rocker that stood by the wall.

How poor aged grandpa in fierce battle fell; 
'Neat!' the stars and the stripes he fought bravely and tiara

it could tell of bright days and of dark ones, beside, 
Of the day when dear grandma stood forth as a

The old wooden rocker that stands by the wall.

But poor grandma is gone, and her stories are done, 
Her children have followed her, yes, one by one; 
They have all gone to meet her " in the sweet by and bye, 
And all that is left is dear sister and I; 
Never more will we hide her gold specks or her cap, 
Never more will we tease her while taking her nap; 
Never more will she slumber in that chair grim

Street, Cincinnati, Ohio.

How oft when we hear of misfortune, 
Befalling a, friend or a 
foe, 
if in joy or regrets we express it, 
That's the way of the world you all koow; 
I 
thought I 
would speak of a 
subject, 
Interesting each village and town, 
That is iron-heeled capital striving 
To put the poor workingman down. 
CHORUS. 
Let capital shake hands with labor, 
Let the poor have the bread that they eon, 
ior surely they need every penny, 
Is a 
lesson quite easy to learn; 
Remember the poor love their children, 
So give them a 
smile, not a 
frown, 
Live, and let live, be your motto, 
Oh i 
don't put the poor workingman down. 
That money is the root of all evil, 
Why all of us likely's found out, 
The richer class think that the poorer, 
Should of pleasure know nothing about; 
The honest poor always will labor; 
They don't ask a 
title or crown. 
Why begrudge them sufficient to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc. 
So now in conclusion I'll mention, 
That life being dear to us all, 
The poorer class must have existence, 
So — -- don't push them close to the wall 
Now hope that in future, the richer 
On the poorer will smile and not frown, 
Who ask but enough just to live on, 
Don't put the pour workingman down. 
Let capital, et'

Is found in a

But give me the glori.

Where one can get healthy and brown. 
I

I'll tell you the reason why—

Down, down by the old water mill 
Close by the side o a 
rippling rill, 
In a 
dear little cottage just under the hill, 
That's where I 
met with my darling. 
She showed me an_ ducks and the drakes, 
She showed me the docks and the hens, 
She showed me the shovels and rakes, 
And the dear little ba's in their pens. 
She showed me the birds and the bees, 
And likewise the pigs and the sows, 
She showed me the butter and cheese, 
And also the bulls and thc cows. 
Down, down, &c. 
The ducks they would waddle to greet her, 
The geese made a 
terrible row,

YOU may talk about your dashing blondes, 
And lovely brunettes gay; 
But there's none so fair that can compare 
With my Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
She's only seventeen years old, and has such modest zrace, 
'Twould do you good, indeed it would, to see her smiling face, 
Ann hear her little prattling tongue, 
Would steal your heart away. 
Her feet are small, and she's not tall, 
My Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
CHORUS. 
We first met, ' twas in summer, 
(BREAK.) 
And for life I 
think I've won her. 
(BREAK .) 
You may talk about your dasbing blondes,: 
And lovely brunettes gay; 
But there's none so fair that can compare, 
With my Belle of Pleasure Bay. 
Of course I've rivals by the score, 
Who think that her they'll win; 
They praise her hair but she don't care, 
She's not to be taken in. 
She treats them all with kind respect but says she must refuse, 
For gold nor land can win her hand, from the lover she diet 
choose. 
So soon we'll married be, and then 
I'll bring her here some day. 
Lad than with me, you will agree

written and sung by HENRY CARNEY, with marked success at Tony Pas* 
tor's Theatre, New York. 
You've all heard of the solid men, 
And men of great renown; 
But if you'll listen for awhile 
I'm certain you will own 
That I'm the mo:,1- respected man 
In this great town; and why ? 
It is because when I 
walk out 
You will hear the people cry— 
CHORUS. 
I'm Mr. Johnny Dougherty, the tailor 
A 
man of great renown; 
And everybody knows that to make a 
suit of clothe/ 
I'm the very best you'll find in all the town. 
I've heard them say a 
tailor is 
The'ninth part of a 
man; 
Let them get up and knock me 
Into nine parts if they can. 
Devil a 
one would ever dare 
To box me for a 
foe, 
Vol- I 
can box as well as stitch. 
As very well they know.

Many, young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too diffi•. 
de 
xil ar-too fearful of a 
repulse to venture upon asking the mornentotre 
question. 
The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unladylike encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. Tnis pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unles s 
it accords

the state of their affections which fact makes a 
further explanation un-

Unfortunatly, there is
