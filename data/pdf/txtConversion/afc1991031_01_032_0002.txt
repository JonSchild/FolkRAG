Artifact Log 
See "director's report" by Marshall (1981) for discussion. 
No systematic effort at collection was made. 
Certain artifacts that were small, interesting, and available 
were collected during the daily rounds of field documentation. 
They were presented to the Foundation in Colorado as the nucleus 
of the future collections department of the museum. 
We discussed various ways to log and inventory the miscellaneous 
artifacts; we settled on the mathod used by the Lowie Museum at 
the University of California, Berkeley, as described by Elke Dettmer. 
That system will serve well enough until the museum has a professional 
staff to develop their own techniques.
