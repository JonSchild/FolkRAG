A mutual acquaintance put me in touch with Zack Mullins via Instagram. We had planned on conducting 
this interview in December of 2021, but Zack notified me to let me know that there had been a COVID 
outbreak at the Lost Creek, Kentucky Post Office where he works, and that it would be best to reschedule. 
On Saturday, January 8, 2022, I drove down to meet Zack at the Jackson, Kentucky Post Office, two days 
after a big snowstorm had hit the region. We sat in the break room area of the back of the post office for 
the interview, and I wore a mask for COVID safety. 
 
Zack Mullins (b. 1986, Hazard, Kentucky) is a clerk at the rural Lost Creek, Kentucky Post Office, a 
Remotely Managed Post Office with 400 PO Boxes. Mullins is the only employee staffed at that office. 
His official title is Postal Support Employee, Sales and Service Distribution Associate or PSESSDA and 
he is a member of the American Postal Workers Union (APWU). He was hired in 2019 and only worked 
for about 6 months until the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In this interview, Mullins speaks about the 
relationships he’s developed with his customers, many of whom are elderly, the impact of COVID on his 
work and the community he serves, the importance of mail for him as a kid growing up in remote and 
rural Eastern Kentucky, and privatization of the Postal Service.

ZM: Zack Mullins 
EH: Emily Hilliard 
 
00:00 
EH: Alright. So the date is January 8th, 2021 
 
ZM: 2 
 
EH: What? 
 
ZM: 2022 
 
EH: 2022! Yes! That's right. (laughs) First 2022 interview too. And I'm at the Jackson, Kentucky Post 
Office with Zack Mullins. Why don't you introduce yourself and tell me who you are, where you're from, 
and when you were born. Just the year. 
 
ZM: My name is Zack Mullins. I grew up and was born in Hazard, Kentucky in 1986. I'm pretty much 
like the first person in my immediate family that's worked for the Postal Service, but I've had friends and 
family that's been working for the Postal Service for, oh, a long time. I mean I've known, I have a friend 
that's a clerk in Richmond that's been there for about 7-8 years. I have a cousin that actually has done 
route delivery probably close to 10? And of course I have other friends that are route carriers and clerks 
as well. But the first time I ever, like I said, I tried to get on [at] the Postal Service for a while. I ended up 
getting hired in 2019. During that point in time, didn't know what was gonna start happening in 2020! 
(laughs) When basically, so I had about 6 months of you know, normal postal work, without having to 
deal with a pandemic, a global pandemic around us. So the past 2 years have been handling mail in a rural 
office during the pandemic. It's had its shares of challenges and its scares and triumphs and stuff like that. 
It's been really honestly a fulfilling experience doing all of this for as long as I have. I mean my heart's 
really into it. I'd like to do it for, basically to the point that I couldn't work no more actually. But no, it's 
basically it's really fulfilling to be in the Postal Service and being a part of this age-old institution. It's 
been, like I said, it's had its ups and it's had its downs. I mean the only thing I could ever say that is that 
like this is the kind of job you don't want if you don't want to get close to people. Like I mean, if you don't 
want to become like attached or build up a repertoire [report] with everybody and stuff like that. It's like I 
said overall though, it's also just something that like, you don't want to see the mail die, 'cause a lot of 
people still depend on it this very day, especially in these rural areas. Also just growing up, like I said, I 
was born in '86 so I'm 35 years old. I remember back in, like the closest metropolitan area is about an 
hour and 30, 2 hours away. And if you wanted to get anything cool, you had to rely on mail order 
(laughs). So I've always had a heart with the Postal Service because of what they've done and enriched my 
life for as long as they have and now it's like my turn to return it. But yeah, that's pretty much just the 
short gist of everything, though. 
 
03:08  
 
EH: Nice. Yeah, why don't you tell me what initially drew you to the Postal Service? 
 
ZM: Well, it's honestly, honestly, it's the public service aspect. That's the one thing that people tend to 
forget about Postal Workers is that we're public servants. We're a part of the government, but we're not 
part of the government--just depends on who you're asking. And also it's just the fact is, people always 
have that misconception that taxes pay for the United States Postal Service, which it does not. We haven't 
taken tax money since about the 80s. We've been trying for years to become self-reliant through the sale 
of like stamps and shipping services and stuff like that. But what mostly drawed me to it, like I said, is I

like, I like it, I understand it, it's just one of those things, it's just always really impressive to think of how 
you can get something from point A to point B in such a little process, like you can mostly get it there 
faster than you can by taking a flight. And that's why it's pretty amazing, because the whole logistics of 
everything and the parts and pieces. And like I said, it's the whole cast of characters, it's not just one 
person. It's a lot of like, like I said you meet a lot of people, you learn things and stuff like that. And like I 
said, there's always just something a little bit new you learn every day. Then that's what drawed me to it. 
 
EH: Yeah, take me through a normal day on the job from when you get in to when you leave. 
 
04:33  
 
ZM: So for the most part is is that I do distribution here in Jackson in the morning before I go to my 
office. Normally a truck comes in in the morning, unloads pallets of packages and cages of mail that we 
distribute out through the office. We make sure we scan every package that comes in so that way the 
tracking information is up to date and it's also reflecting where it's currently at because people really do 
follow that tracking information. Once that's done, I will move over and actually case the mail for the box 
section here in Jackson and distribute packages into parcel lockers and the mailboxes if they fit and so on. 
Once that's done, I leave here and I drive south to Lost Creek, which is the office that I'm based out of. 
When I get there, my mail is dropped off in that office so I'll have a bag of like smaller packages, and I'll 
have larger packages sitting in on my sorting table, and also, I'll have trays of mail that I'll have to put up. 
So pretty much first thing in the morning is is getting the packages all sorted out and knowing, so 
basically putting packages in boxes that you can put in there and then leaving notices for boxes that are 
too big. Also second notices when people haven't picked up stuff like that, then you move over to casing 
the mail in the boxes and then also after that there's also tubs of magazines and stuff, which we refer to as 
flats. So put flats up and everything. Once that's done, make initial scans, saying this has all been done, 
everything's updated, and then I will proceed with my day of customer service, stamps, money orders, 
shipping services. And of course, inquiries about where something's at and stuff like that. Then once that's 
done, I will collect the mail out of the blue box, and say that that's been done. Then after that's done, I will 
make my dispatch scans and then I will leave the office, because the carrier will come in after I leave and 
pick up my outgoing mail and take it to here, and then it goes out from here to the next destination. And 
that's pretty much the whole entire day. 
 
06:44  
 
EH: And how long as is your typical day? 
 
ZM: It's 4 hours. It's from 10am-2pm, Monday through Friday. Saturdays is a little different. It's 9am to 
11:45. Saturdays are normally shorter than the rest of the week. But yeah, it's pretty much, that's just, 
pretty much day in, day out, that's exactly the game plan of how I follow everything. 
 
EH: And so it's open, only open 4 hours a day? 
 
ZM: 4 hours a day. A lot of the smaller RMPOs, they got reorganized back in 2013 so that was about 9 
years ago at this rate. So a lot of these smaller offices, these smaller RMPOS got knocked down from 
being like 6 hour offices to 4 hour offices. Some got knocked down even further to be 2 hour offices. But 
that's pretty much it. That's how it's been since about 2013. 
 
EH: Mmhm. And what's your exact title?

Interview with Zack Mullins – 1/8/22

ZM: Postal Support Employee, Sales and Service Distribution Associate. Or PSESSDA. Also commonly 
we're just referred to as clerks. 
 
EH: And are you part of a union? 
 
ZM: I am part of the American Postal Workers Union, the APWU.  
 
EH: Why don't you tell me about some of the relationships you've developed with your customers? You 
were telling me some of those stories before we talked. So yeah, tell me about some of them. 
 
ZM: For me, starting out, I'm a little bit of a different character. I mean I'm not like--it was  a little bit of 
alienation starting out because nobody likes getting somebody new. They get used to who they've had for 
years and then that person gets pulled out and it sort of upsets the balance of everything. So over time, 
people started warming up to me and everything and I've started building bonds. 2 of the big ones that I 
can talk about it, there is a Christian school that is in proximity of my office, probably not even a mile or 
so, they get all their mail brought to my office and normally they send a person over from the school to 
pick up the mail every day. There for a long while it was an older lady named Nancy that was coming 
over and getting the mail, getting the mail and everything. Me and her built up a very good bond. We 
would sit there and talk. Eventually, whenever I saw her show up, I would normally meet her outside and 
put the mail in the car for her. Because like I said, she was probably in her 80s? But yeah, I mean, thing 
was, she was punctual. If it was 11 o'clock, she was getting the mail. And everybody else that showed up, 
I would tell Miss Nancy, I would be like, well at least they're being slackers. They're not coming at 11 
o'clock. Like I said, you're like on the thing. Recently during over the course of the pandemic and 
everything, she was not able to come into the office. But another thing is though unfortunately, though, 
she has, her memory is not as good. But the one thing that she always remembers is to get that mail! 
(laughs) But no, she was a sight. She's still good. I see her every once in a while, somebody from the 
school will bring her over. But no, she is one of my favorite people in the office. 
 
And also there was a gentleman named Tim that took up with me. He was a retired Navy member. Over 
the years, me and him became real good with a bond. Unfortunately at the beginning of last year, Tim 
passed away from cancer and for a while there he wasn't able to get his mail. I would take his mail to him 
and talk, see him every day. I saw him every day up until the point that he started getting very ill. And 
like I said, eventually he couldn't walk or anything like that. And like I said, eventually he succumbed to 
cancer and of course, I, in my respective duty, I attended his funeral and everything and I was still there 
for his family and stuff like that. But he was probably like one hands down, like one of my favorite people 
as well because of that. And like I said, there's just people, like you know when babies are born (laughs) 
and all the other stuff. I mean it's just sort of like, especially when you work out of an office of that size, 
it's very, like I said it's very personable, basically you become like a hub. Like a lot of these offices is 
pretty much like a pillar of the community. They don't have much of anything else, but they got a Post 
Office! (laughs). And everybody in the world congregate at the Post Office. But no, I mean for the most 
part is, it's just like stuff like that. But no, like I said, I'll say it again, it's just not a job you want to have if 
you build bonds with people very easily. That's especially the case in my office. The problem is is that a 
majority, well I say probably close to a majority of the tenants in my office are normally older people. I 
mean they can die from natural causes, of age, I've had a few people die from COVID-19 as well. It's 
pretty, like I said, the most part is, you see a lot of people come in, you see a lot of people go out and you 
never see some people again. And that's pretty much how it all boils down to. 
 
EH: Yeah. Is that a normal thing to take someone their mail if they get too sick?

ZM: It's normally not. I did it outside of my duty. I mean most part is, that was a gentleman, he had no 
other way to get it. You just had to. I mean that I know that it might cause issues for doing it but I mean, 
for the most part is they never got delivery to their address, though. But just like it was also being a friend 
outside of the, I mean I know like I said, there's a lot of like exclamation points and question marks of like 
being like sort of a no-no or anything like that, but I mean most part is it's due diligence and doing your 
job, you know? I mean I don't want, I mean especially in a case like that, I would go out of my way to do 
that, you know? 
 
EH: Yeah, I heard that from other workers, just carriers who see somebody fall and their postmaster 
wants them to keep moving on the route, and they're like, I'm not leaving this person (laughs). 
 
ZM: No, I mean that's exactly, I mean the fact is is there's a drawing, there's just a line in the middle of it. 
The most part is, it's like why can you get in trouble for it--you're delivering the mail. You're getting it 
there. You know? And if you get it there and get it safe, then your job is done. That's how I looked at it. 
I'm pretty sure there'd be other people that tell me I'm totally wrong about it, (laughs) but like, that's how I 
am, you know? 
 
13:59  
 
EH: How many boxes does your office serve? 
 
ZM: My office, my box section is about roughly I want to say about 400 boxes. I'll say that currently I 
probably have in the ballpark of about 250 maybe 270 out of the group rented? That office is pretty much 
the only office that services, like that services the south end of Breathitt County. There used to be an 
office in Clayhole, Kentucky, but it is, it don't have a box section or anything like that anymore. It's more 
just like they sell goods and services but they don't have none of the other features of a normal office. 
 
EH: I see. And do you know how many routes go out of your post office? 
 
ZM: My office does not have any route mail out of it. Only the route mail comes out of Jackson, but yeah, 
normally most RMPOs, especially like smaller ones, there is some that do have routes that come out of 
them but in my case, my office does not. 
 
EH: And what does RMPO stand for? 
 
ZM: I've heard many different names for it. I think the technical name for it is Remotely Managed Post 
Office, or Remote Managed Post Office. What it is is that I may be the only person in the office and in 
hindsight, technically it is postmaster work but they've done away with the postmaster title in those 
offices, so it's just now clerks that run these offices. 
 
EH: I've heard that, yeah. 
 
ZM: So yeah, so basically like the postmaster over Jackson technically resides over Lost Creek, but I'm 
the body in Lost Creek. 
 
15:40  
 
EH: Got it. And so you have other coworkers that are with you in the post office?

ZM: Only when I work in Jackson.  
 
EH: I see.  
 
ZM: In Lost Creek it is all me. Anything that goes in and out goes through me in Lost Creek. 
 
EH: Wow. So what happens if you get sick--are there subs? 
 
ZM: Basically the other, like I said, in most like offices with a hub and spoke design, there's normally 
extra, normally there's about 2 or 3 clerks, maybe more, maybe less, it just really depends on the office. 
Most of the time it would be someone like, a Part-Time Flex or a PTF or somebody like that or maybe 
possibly like another person that works in an RMPO comes in and works with it. 
 
EH: Okay. So I know you only had a few months before the pandemic hit but how has COVID impacted 
your work? 
 
ZM: Well, I'll tell you right now, it's that it basically, the volume exploded after the pandemic started. It 
was not very uncommon for us to be working anywhere from 2-3 times normal, excuse me, amounts of 
mail. I mean for the most part is, when the pandemic first started and the first like general shock of it all 
when everything started, we were about working like peak level packages. Like in the middle of like the 
spring. Like I said, most of the time our heaviest time is normally between November and the end of 
December because of Christmas. But yeah, we were working like near peak level packages when the 
pandemic first started. When things started calming down and things started opening back up, it sort of 
leveled out but it seems like the amount of packages we've been getting never dropped since that point. 
It's still pretty, it's higher than what it was, like I said, it was only about 6 months before it hit, for me at 
least. But yeah, and also, another thing is people just getting sick and passing away from COVID-19 has 
also affected it. I can't think off hand how many box holders I've lost due to COVID-19. 
 
EH: Wow. 
 
ZM: I mean, I know it's probably less than 10 but more than 2.  
 
EH: Wow, that's awful. So there was sort of that initial worry that maybe the virus could get passed 
through the mail. Was that a concern at all? 
 
18:03  
 
ZM: For the most part is, that started happening, that started to come up and everything. I never really 
thought of it to be an issue, just due to the fact of the travel of mail and stuff like that. I mean, it can go 
from like one temperature to another and everything like that and plus also, it wasn't like particulate, you 
know? It wasn't like something you could knock off the package and it would get to you or anything like 
that. Basically it would just soak in and that's it. I mean the Postal Service was quick to react with 
protocol and stuff like that and also the immediate rush of trying to figure out if it was passable in mail 
(laughs). 
 
EH: Mmhm, mmhm. And oh, so the packages--are those like mostly Amazon like online mail or are 
people sending more care packages? 
 
ZM: I mean for the most part is, the mail is just I mean like it's not...it's a little bit of Amazon, it's a little 
bit of Walmart, I mean it's still mostly just a very big like mix of everything coming through. There's still 
AFC 2021/010: Rural Free Delivery: Mail Carriers in Central Appalachia / Emily Hilliard 
Interview with Zack Mullins – 1/8/22 
8 
 
a lot of person-to-person package mailing and stuff like that--that's still pretty prominent. Also Veterans 
Affairs sends a lot of their prescriptions through the Postal Service as well. Other than that, though, it's 
not just one thing that takes up all the volume, though. 
 
19:29  
 
EH: So for somebody who has maybe never been to Eastern Kentucky and might be listening to this, 
could you describe the community that you serve and the landscape and the people? 
 
ZM: Basically my post office is smack dab next to State Highway 15. It's basically in between a valley, so 
there's a mountain on one side of the office and then you go a couple feet and there's another mountain. 
It's a very small community per se but it also services a lot of Highway 476 that goes up for miles into, so 
a lot of people up through there as well. The community, like I said, it's very small. I mean it's not like, 
it's not big I would say by any means, but it's very small like I said. There's a volunteer fire department, 
there's a gas station, the Christian school, and the post office. But no, I mean it's very pretty in the 
summer and the spring but then it's a flat out nightmare when it hits the wintertime! (laughs). 
 
EH: Yeah, we just got a big snowstorm here. 
 
ZM: So yeah, that puts a lot of hamper on the mail but I mean we will go out and through due diligence 
try to get everything to everybody. I mean "rain, sleet, or snow."--it's never been an official motto, but I 
mean it's associated with the postal service, though. 
 
EH: Mmhm. And is there an aspect of your job that you think might be particular to this place in the 
country?  
 
ZM: It's basically being able to talk to people. I mean like you can sit there and be robotic and very 
unpersonable about it, you know, but that's one thing is, is that a lot of people in the postal network in the 
Southeast, in the Appalachians in general, to be honest with you, it's a lot warmer and it's a lot more 
kinder. Because I know that postal workers normally have a notorious rep for being like jerks, you know. 
 
EH: Oh really? 
 
ZM: I mean but that's, there's jerks everywhere in any job. But no, it's mostly the big thing is, you just 
have to know how to network with people. Like I said, it's like getting to know them and stuff like that so 
you can be like, "Well how was the baby's birthday?" or "How's mom and baby doing?" and stuff like 
that. Mostly, there's more personal connections in this, in this area, in the postal--I mean they're probably 
everywhere, but I know that personally in my day-to-day it's like, it's something that if you can't talk to 
people, you're pretty much in trouble. Like you have to be able to speak to people. 
 
EH: And do people know you? I know you're from Hazard so you're a little out of town but do people 
know you and your family? 
 
22:10  
ZM: Oddly enough, there is a few, there's actually a few people that have known me pre-Postal Service 
that actually come to my office. Oddly enough, a lot of the people that know, actually know my father 
(laughs) and that's, a lot of it's because they know my dad because my dad had been a coal miner for 42 
years. So he's made a lot of connections and knows a lot of people and stuff like that. But he, but other 
than that, there was actually a kid that I grew up with, I didn't realize he moved to Lost Creek and he 
came in the office one day and I was totally floored! I was like oh my goodness! But that's pretty much

Interview with Zack Mullins – 1/8/22

about it, though, like I said, the majority of the people that I've met through my job is new acquaintances 
instead of like older ones. 
 
EH: What would you say is your favorite part of the job?  
 
ZM: Actually my favorite part of the job is just giving people their mail! (laughs) I mean for the most 
part, you can't help, I mean maybe it diminishes when you get a little bit older or especially someone that 
didn't rely on mail order growing up. You always just get excited when you get a package or something. 
And also it just sort of like, people being like, oh that came in, that's great, and like being happy and also 
like I said, just giving people their mail, also just making those connections with people. I mean you get 
to hear so many stories and you get to hear so much about their--you get to learn about people's lives. You 
get to see I mean everybody in every shape and walk of life and that's really interesting as well. 
 
EH: Are there, what is maybe the most interesting pieces of mail that you've encountered, or maybe most 
unusual?  
 
ZM: I'll be honest with you, it's like the most interesting mail that I get, whenever you get a piece of mail 
and it actually has a dollar bill in it. Or change. Which is, it just throws you off. You're just like why is 
there money? But yeah, most of the time, that's like non-profits and charity stuff. Most of 'em, that's 
always what, that's always what I find really interesting is just basically whenever there's change and like 
dollar bills just front and center in the mail. It always just sort of like amuses me. Other than that though, 
it's pretty much just run of the mill, like nothing too crazy. 
 
24:36  
 
EH: You don't get packages of baby chicks or anything like that? 
 
ZM: I have had chickens before actually! People are still amazed that we mail chickens. I mean, well right 
now it hasn't been much of an issue because of the cold and they don't like to mail them when it's cold. 
But I mean in the spring and summer time, you can come here and you can probably hear baby chicks. 
Also bees. We've had bees in here. And I had a queen one time and I had it in my office and I was like 
man, I hope they come get it! (laughs) But yeah we had a whole box of bees one day come in. I mean they 
were just basically it was like in a little mesh box. But I mean it was a ton of bees! (laughs) 
 
EH: So you could see them? 
 
ZM: Yeah, you could see them and you could hear them. 
 
EH: Wow. (laughs) Yeah, that's kind of scary! 
 
ZM: Yeah, I think about chickens and insects are about the only things you can like ship that's living in 
the Postal Service. Also crickets and stuff like that we've got through the mail. But yeah, chickens though, 
normally that's pretty much bigger, like in the warmer months of the year, then it dies off going into the 
winter months and then all over again. But yeah, people are just sort of dumbfounded when you're like, 
hey you can mail chickens, you know? (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah, yeah. So one of the things I've found is that there's a lot of musicians and creative types that 
work in the Postal Service. So yeah, tell me a little bit about music or bands you've been in and if there 
might be any connection there?

ZM: Honestly, the most part was growing up, probably like my late teens, early twenties, I was in a 
handful of punk bands and stuff like that growing up. Honestly a lot of the experiences that mostly 
generated the punk band itself was that actually me and a bandmate worked together at FedEx, so I've 
been working in logistics for quite a while actually, maybe off and on. But yeah, so it was really working 
for FedEx that led to that eventually, but I know that there's been a lot of people like John Prine was a 
postal worker and stuff like that. I mean I haven't really done anything lately in music to pull any 
inspiration or idea from. But I know the Postal Service does run through you know, arts and entertainment 
throughout the whole entire thing. I mean everybody's favorite postal worker is Cliff Clavin from Cheers 
(laughs) you know? 
 
EH: Right, yeah--I forgot about him! 
 
27:06  
 
ZM: Yeah, Cliff Clavin. And actually in the Postal Museum, his outfit, his actual postal garb is actually in 
the Postal Museum at the Smithsonian. 
 
EH: Wow, that's cool. 
 
ZM: So yeah, but that's pretty much about all I can really say on that though. 
 
EH: And when you were a kid and getting stuff through the mail, was that music-related stuff, or what 
was it? 
 
ZM: Honestly, it was just a mishmash of everything. It could have been music related, it could have been 
video game related, it could be movies--stuff like that. Like I said, the closest metropolitan area was about 
an hour and 30 or 45 minutes away. And like it just ain't one of those things you just get up and go, "I 
want to drive to Lexington!" (laughs) you know? That's definitely harder when you're younger. But no, I 
mean even to this day I still order a vast majority of my stuff through the Postal Service, especially vinyl 
records and stuff like that through Media Mail. The majority of the records I've gotten in the last few 
years, about probably 60% of it's been delivered or handled by the Postal Service. But yeah, I mean it's a 
lot easier to order it and have it brought to you then it is to try to run out and get it, you know? 
 
EH: So, you said your dad was a coal miner and I wonder if there's maybe an attraction to the Post Office 
because it is a union job? Was that part of what was compelling to you? 
 
ZM: Well mostly what it was is that I've seen what has happened with like management of mines and 
especially we've had the whole entire ordeal in Harlan County and all that other stuff, like my father 
always wanted to make sure that me and my brother never stepped foot in a mine. So that like I said, we 
didn't have to go through what he worked through. He worked 42 years. He was laid off in December of 
2019, the mine in Hazard shut down which was owned by, I can't remember who exactly owned it at that-
-that's another thing is just the turnover of owners in mines in Eastern Kentucky. But no, for the most 
part, I mean, being in the union is a great thing and I mean, but whoever you ask has different opinions of 
the union but I mean unions are responsible for a lot of--working people to this day take [for] granted, like 
the 40-hour work week and you know, paid holidays and stuff like that. I mean because I know a lot of 
people think union's a dirty word, you know. But no, I mean absolutely, I want that representation, I want 
to make sure that I'm working in a safe environment. It's something that like just won’t up and tell and 
close and shut down on you and run away like how many mines have in recent years. So I mean, it's, the 
security is probably the best asset of it all.

EH: Yeah, did you follow some of the you know, when the Postal Service was in the news about 
privatization and closing rural offices, and then just what your thoughts are on the role or the importance 
of rural post offices in rural area. 
 
ZM: Well, I mean for the post part, the whole privatization of the Post Office is just not a good idea. We 
are a public service and it's something not to take for granted and it's honestly, especially in rural mail, 
because you have a lot of people that can't get out or they're too, they're old, and especially like the, let's 
say like a lot of VA prescriptions are mailed through the Postal Service and there's been a lot of talk about 
that as well. But the  closest VA is in Hazard but still that's still a drive, you know, it's still like a 20-30 
minute drive for people. But mostly it's just that like it's, being far out or just being in rural areas, the 
problem is is that the world can't come to us and sometimes it's just really difficult for us to go to the 
world. But for some, for the Postal Service to be there, to bridge that gap for people is important. These 
offices have been pretty much the only thing in a lot of areas for a long time. And without them, the 
amount of hardship and trouble it would create for citizens of that area would be outstanding. It would be 
terrible! And that's one thing I don't what to see happen. I don't want to see these small offices disappear. 
And I know there are sort of overcrowding issues with some of these offices, some areas with smaller 
offices and stuff like that, but I mean for the most part to just sit there and privatize and possibly, you 
know, make the prices so outrageous that nobody wants to use it or anything like that is not gonna help 
anything! I mean I'm hoping that everything's on the right trajectory going forward but I mean rural mail 
is important. I won't say that--I mean all of the mail is important but in these areas, they need to be here to 
help bridge that gap, you know, between them and everybody else.  
 
EH: Right. Is there, or what are the sort of language and terms and maybe even like a work culture that 
you would say is particular to the post office. Are there like names or things you call things that the 
normal person might not know? 
 
33:06  
 
ZM: It's all, like I said, it's a lot of lingo and jargon. I mean for the most part, blue box is the common 
name for the mailboxes or it's a collection box or anything like that. Also like I said, I mentioned earlier 
about flats, which flats is basically a large envelope, but we all refer to them as flats. And of course like 
the mail truck which is an LLV.  
 
EH: What does that stand for? 
 
ZM: Long Life Vehicle. 
 
EH: Okay. 
 
ZM: Currently they're slated to retire the old LLVs and have the new wave of LLVs coming in in the next 
few years. But yeah, the LLV is the technical name of that, of a mail truck, is a Long Life Vehicle. I'm 
trying to think of anything else. Yeah, I do confuse people. I confuse friends and family when I'm talking 
about the mail because I'm using the lingo that we use in here. And of course you have like Priority Mail, 
Priority Express, Media Mail, Parcel Select, all this other stuff, like all these names and levels of mail. 
First Class, Third Class, Pre-sorted Standard, First Class Sorted, you know, stuff like that. There's not a 
whole lot of special lingo, pretty much it's straightforward. I mean we all have to sort of talk the same 
language so there's not any kind of miscommunication. Like you can call basically the language we use, 
you can sit there and call another office and they know exactly what you're talking about. Because like for

example, I've had packages for Lost Creek, Pennsylvania show up at my office. There's actually also a 
Lost Creek in West Virginia. 
 
EH: Yeah, my friends live there. (laughs) 
 
ZM: So yeah, so basically the autofill on online ordering is, it's a catch-22 because sometimes it will fill it 
out for you and then it will fill it out for you wrong. So yeah, I was getting packages for Lost Creek, 
Pennsylvania and I actually had to call them one day and I was like, I have this person's box here. I was 
like, I have this box here. I think it's your box but it's addressed to my office and I give them the name and 
everything and they're like oh yeah, that's theirs. I say, okay, I'm gonna update the zip code on it and I'm 
gonna put it back in the mail and get it to you. I was like, if they ask questions about it (laughs) let them 
know. But yeah, it's just always one of those things you have to be very, basically it just has to be like a 
unified language so that nobody's confused by it, you know? 
 
EH: Are there--what are the stories that postal employees tell to each other about their work? 
 
ZM: I mean for the most part is we just talk about like a lot of the conversation between me and my postal 
friends is just about volume. It's just about how much mail we're getting and stuff like that. I mean we 
don't tend to go too deep into it. We just sit there and talk about what we got, oh we got a lot today or we 
didn't get anything. Stuff like that. I mean really it doesn't get too deep. I mean like I said, it's not a good 
habit to get into, you know? But yeah, that's pretty much about all--the majority of my, like I said, my 
postal friends, they just talk about volume. I mean, that's about it. Because we all pretty much share the 
same experiences in day-to-day operations, so it's sort of like beating a dead horse when you talk about it! 
(laughs) 
 
EH: Right, right. Yeah, what's your least favorite part of the job? 
 
36:29  
 
ZM: Actually my least favorite part oh--that's a good question. There's really nothing I don't--there ain't 
really nothing I don't like. I mean, I like putting up the mail and then some days I don't like putting up the 
mail (laughs). That's where volume comes into play at. But you still, I mean you just get through it. Like I 
said, there's a lot of good days, there's a lot of bad days. But yeah, putting the mail up, too can also be 
difficult at times. (laughs) 
 
EH: Yeah, I bet. Yeah, people have definitely referenced "going postal."  
 
ZM: Yeah, we tend to try to stay away from that statement, actually. It's, yeah, it's sort of, it's frowned 
upon. I don't try to use it, you know. 
 
EH: Okay, let's see what other questions I have here. Do you feel like you're a representative of the 
government? 
 
ZM: I feel like I'm a representative of the United States Postal Service. That's how I look at it. I mean 
that's who I answer to is the Postal Service, and I am, everything, the buildings, the route carriers, the 
vehicles, the people that work in the processing plants, us, we're all the Postal Service. It's not just, it's not 
an idea. It's a whole entire cast of moving pieces that make it happen. And that's how I feel about it. Yeah, 
we're in the government, but technically we're the United States Postal Service and that's the end of it.  
 
EH: Mmhm, mmhm. And how do you stay informed about what's going on?

ZM: Same way everybody else does on the news. I mean also I mean you can sit there, the Postal Service 
has an internal news service that passes stuff to us and stuff like that. But pretty much I find it the same 
way you all do most of the time, is I just find it through there. Also it gets brought in via our internal 
services, but like, if there's, if I want to see like 4 or 5 different takes on an issue, I go directly to the 
internet and find it out that way. 
 
EH: What is your standard uniform? 
 
ZM: Normally slacks and like a polo and stuff. Like I said, you've caught me in out of gear today, cause 
it's cold (laughs). But that's pretty much it, standard stuff like that. I mean the normal, the normal garb of 
a postal worker, you know. 
 
EH: So it's like a light blue official polo. 
 
ZM: Yeah, like a polo and stuff like that and also it just changes around depending on what time of the 
year it is and stuff like that. 
 
EH: And do you get the hats too as a clerk? 
 
ZM: I have a couple hats. [coworker approaches and asks a question] 
 
EH: Oh yeah, it's still going. Okay, let's see. I think we talked through a lot of these. [turns pages] Oh 
yeah, do customers ever bring you things like gifts and you know tips? 
 
ZM: Normally most of the time it's just baked goods. Like cookies and stuff like that, but no. I mean the 
job prevents us from taking not much else, though, you know. Once again, being in public service, the 
first thing you don't want that happens is people thinking that people are getting preferential treatment.  
 
EH: Right. 
 
ZM: So no, most of the time it's just baked goods and stuff like that. 
 
EH: I think those are pretty much all my questions, a lot of these are for carriers.  
 
ZM: Fair. [coworker approaches] 
 
EH: Let's see, do you hope to stay in this position for a long time or do you want to move? 
 
ZM: I want to move up. I want to get more into the system of everything. My heart's like in trying to get 
into supervision and management and stuff like that. I still got a ways to go though, so yeah. 
 
EH: So would that mean becoming a postmaster at another post office? 
 
ZM: I mean for the most part is, the way up for me right now is I would have to transfer into a larger 
office and work there for a little while and get my bearings there and then move in one from there. 
 
EH: I see. 
 
ZM: It's basically working up the ladder.

EH: Uh-huh 
 
ZM: Working in a smaller office there's not much more room for going forward. Basically you're there 
and that's it. But I'd like to be in supervision and stuff going forward. 
 
EH: Nice.  
 
ZM: Yes. 
 
EH: Well is there anything else I didn't ask you about or that you'd like to share? 
 
ZM: Honestly, I think we've hit everything on the head. I mean, I feel happy with it. 
 
EH: Okay, great. Well thank you so much! 
 
ZM: You're welcome, you have a good day! 
 
EH: You too.
