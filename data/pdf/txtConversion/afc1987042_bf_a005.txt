very simple way to do, but (F: mm-hm) it's the traditional plate for the Chirstmas Eve.  (F: 
mm-hm)  And after it's--we put it in a, a--when it's, when you use Portuguese olive oil and 
vinegar, (F: o-oh) and pepper; (F: uh-huh) to go over.  It's like um, like a sauce you put (F:

mm-hm) real crazy.  (F: mm-hm)  Ah-hm, sometimes I-I-I used to go to New Bedford and to buy
them and ah, I think it's the, the place where they, they used to do the, the co--  (F: the sa--where 
they do the salting?)  The salting, yes.  (F: mm-hm)  It's cheaper, it's cheaper.  (F: mm-hm)  And 
lots of people going there, and likes          , i-it's, the people likes codfish, really.  (F: mm-hm, 
mm-hm)  But eh it's nothing like the fre-fresh codfish, I don't care about it.  (F: mm-hm)  Not 
really.  People use-- (F: mm-hm)  You can use to, you can make a marinara same way (F: 
mm-hm) I said for the roast beef.  Ma-marinara, it's a marinara.  It goes for fish, it goes for meat. 
A marinara, it's a marinara.  (F: mm-hm)  So.  In meat I used to do with wine.  (F: mm-hm)  For 
fish I used to do with limes (F: mm-hm) or vinegar, (F: mm-hm) a half and a half.  (F: ah-hah!)  
Water and vinegar.  (F: ahh)  And make sure you put ground        and hot pepper.  (F: oh)  
Special.  (F: oh, it sounds good)  Make a marinara could be a f-f-fresh codfish (F: mm-hm)  or 
any fish.  (F: mm-hm)  And you can fry, you can bake, you can do (F: mm-hm) everything.  
F:
Do you ever fix um a fish called [garupa]?
S:
Yeah.  Called [garupa].  You talking about [garupa].  (F: garupa, yes)  It's a Portuguese 
fish.  (F: yes)  It's very good.  (F: yes)  Very good.  We can make like, I can't say, soup.  In 
Portugal         .  Usual they say um called       .  (F: uh-huh)  Or called [garopa].  [Garopa]            
we can do it in-n different ways.  (F: mm-hm)  We can roast, (F: mm-hm) put in the oven.  (F: 
mm-hm)  We can fry.  Put like just garlic and salt.  (F: garlic and salt, uh-huh)  And--yes--and 
you, before you fry you, you know, eh corn flour.  (F: mm-hm)  You, you, you put in corn 
flou--you involve it (F: mm-hm) in the corn flour (F: mm-hm) and then you fry.  So it's very 
good, very good.  (F: mmmm)  [Garopa].
F:
The man up at the um, s-selling out of the the truck had [garopa] (S: yeah) today, and of 
course I had never seen it before.  He has it flown over from--well, I mean he doesn't--somebody 
flies it over from the Azores once a week.
S:
Yeah.  Everybody it's flying back and forth.  (F: mm-hm)  Not me.  I'm the oldest, I mean 
I never did go back.  I like to but, I didn't.  (F: yup)  [laughs]  I don't know.  Maybe someday I 
will.  (F: mm-hm)
F:
Do your, do your children want to go?  Have they--or have they been?
S:

grandchildren.  One (F: ah-h-h) from each children.  (F: mm-hm)  They are all big.  Taller than

eh John.  John [Da Silva].  Or [Juan] in Portuguese.  (F: uh-huh)  And he did go with his wife 
and the daughter to the Portugal and Azores.  (F: mm-hm)  He loved to go.  Loved to go.  It was 
very nice.  And eh all the--it's my oldest daughter.  She's a social work.  And eh she did go about 
three years--two years ago.  She (F: mm-hm) did go.  She already go twice.  And eh she likes to

M-Maryland.  She works for ah, a company, she's a personnel director.  She's eh, sh--they, we--I 
can say--we have been lucky in this country.  They have been working and studying.  My

you up.
S:

(F: mm-hm) to Maryland.  And she's going to take this for her.  (F: oh-h)  Ah--I, I make this suit. 
This is the skirt with the, the pockets.  (F: oh, it's perfect!)  Oh, yes.  If eh she's going to buy with
this material.  Can you see the material?  (F: mm-hhmm)  In the store, it's going to be about three
hundred dollars (F: mm-hm) or over.  And eh--  (F: oh, so beautiful!)  This one, she's going to 
take this one now; because she, she said she likes to have eh [too much].  She likes to have one 
like this color or off-white.  (F: uh-huh)  So I made this (F: uh-huh) for her.  She choose the style.
F:
You found beautiful buttons, too.  (S: yeah)  I mean, they really complement it.
S:
[interrupts]  Can you see the whole buttons?
F:
[draws in breath sharply]  Hu-u-u-uh!  I've tried to do that.  [laughs]  I've tried to do that.  
(S: see)  Oh my goodness!  Oh-h.  Oh-h.  Just beautiful!  [both talk]  And tiny, tiny invisible hand
sewing.  
S:
If you can see it, it on, on the person it looks better, (F: oh) much better, but [over here] 
it's different.  But um, it doesn't fit me.  I can't try.  [both laugh]  See.  It's (F: aw-w-w) like this    
pockets.  (F: o-o-h)  This one, she doesn't--she knows about this one, but she doesn't know about 
this one.  This one, this one in checks, it's going to be her Christmas gift.  (F:  oh-h, what a--)  We
got--she doesn't wear (F: oh-h) clothes from like Jordan Marsh or stores like that.  (F: mm-hm)  
She have to be--to dress very well.  (F: mm-hm)  And, but she wears everything I do.  (F: oh)  
But and even my, my daughter-in-law, she's eh, she's work for the microwave.  (F: oh that is 
so-o--)  It's like it was (F: --beautiful!) in magazine.  (F: uh-huh)  I don't know if you saw this 
magazine.  It's exact this way.  (F: oh-h)  So I did this. (F: oh-h)  You have the skirt.  The skirt is 
same style.  (F: uh-huh, uh-huh)  It's the, the way they are using now, straight.  (F: mm-hm)  And 
eh--  (F: mm-hm)  And this a, this material cost very expensive; very, very expensive material.  
(F: oh-h it--oh feel that)  [both talk]  (F: yes!)  Y-y-you, (F: yeah) you can feel it.  (F: mm-hm)  
And it's              the kind in velvet.  (F: mm-hm)  And the buttons, so.  (F: mm-hm)  I execute it 
like, I did like.  (F: oh, goodness!)
F:
She (S: see) must be so proud!
S:
In Portugal I was a Portuguese teacher.  And besides this I have a fashion house and have 
girls working for me.  (F: in Portugal)  In Portugal.  So, my, and I work for the Singer Company 
for a few years.  I was going around and around teaching (F: ah-huh) [both talking] [embroiled] 
in the sewing, (F: mm-hm, mm-hm) sewing machines.  (F: mm-hm)  So my dream still was to 
teach someone.  Because it's sad, we go in, we go into any place you can see girls all over the 
place on the streets, isn't it?  (F: mm-hm)  And do nothing.  They don't have nothing to do.           
.  In Portugal, when I was there, I'm from there for twenty years, but all the girls know some 
skills.  They could do something nice.  Sewing.  Do (F: mm-hm) something (F: mm-hm) 
important.  Today it's real a pity.  They can't put a, a button on.  (F: uh-huh)  They can't do 
anything.  So I like very much to teach in some (F: uh-huh) place, someone, to do something like
that.  [laughs]  Because uh believe me, (F: oh my, oh my) it's, it's well done.  (F: oh yes, it is well
done)  See.  (F: goodn--you could not--)  So she doesn't know about this one.  (F: you could not 
buy it that well made)  No.  (F: absolutely not ever)  Yeah, she c-- (F: uh-huh)  To buy a suit like 
this, she's going to pay lot of money.  (F: yeah)  She's a (F: but even so it wouldn't be as well 
made) [both talk] my daughter-in-law, she's a           [controller to the, a controller to the] 
Microwave.  She's driving three, four times a week to go, to New York, (F: uh-huh) and she did 
(F: uh-huh) already [forty-three year].  And, and she loves the suits I do for her because she said 
"Ma, I took this suit, I put in the luggage,  (F: uh-huh)  and my, my, it, when I just took it off and 
that's it, I wear.  I don't have to worry more about it.  It's, I don't, I don't need to worry no (F: 
uh-huh) more (F: uh-huh) anything."  (F: uh-huh)  So.  I'm s--always busy.  [laughs]  
F:
Who taught you to sew?
S:
Pardon me?  
F:
Who taught you to sew?  Where did you learn?
S:
Oh.  I start very early.  My mother was a very--a very nice mother.  And she always was 
thinking about um their childrens' future.  (F: mm-hm)  I have, after, I still was in school and I 
was going a few hours for the, the lady she have girls working for her, too.  And uh doing clothes
for the most eh--oh like people (F: mm-hm) can wear-- (F: yes, uh-huh) and pay for a good 
clothes.  (F: uh-huh) Very prominent people, you know.  (F: yes)  I can say it.  And uh she, my 
mother was eh her--[sighs] she, she was eh her s-mother, godmother.  (F: ah)  That's why she put 
me there.  And I did         .  I learned to sew.  And after even when I was a Portuguese teacher I 
was teaching children, I mean elementary school.  (F: mm-hm)  Besides this I, I ha--I always 
sewing, always sewing.  I sta--I started in money sewing with the [tineasel].  (F: ah-hah)  
[laughs]  I have more upstairs, (F: mmmm) but I'm not going to        when I come home, go up to
(F: mmmm; can we pin that back on you?)  Oh, thank you.
F:
Are there other, are there other traditional kinds of needlework in Portugal?
S:
Many, many.  [loud background noises; something drops]  (F: oops!) [pause: 10 sec. as 
noise continues]  (F: thanks!)  [sighs]  They can knitting, (F: mm-hm) knitting.  (F: uh-huh)  
Doing beautiful shawls, sweaters, eh coats, skirts, everything.  (F: mm-hm)  And eh likes in, in 
special some islands like Pico.  In Pico it's one island.  The, i-, (F: mm-hm) the name it's Pico.  
(F: mm-hm)  Because it's real a pico.  [chuckles]  (F: oh-h!)  A big (F: uh-huh) volcano there.  (F:
uh-huh)  And eh, the girls in my times, they stay home.  They don't go work to any place.  They 
stay home and doing this, like this lace.   It's-- (F: oh, like this)  Yeah.  Wh--
F:

F:

S:

granddaughter, but I don't have it at home.  A beautiful one in white.  Beautiful one.  (F: mm-hm)
I likes she have it when I'm going to, to another world.  [both laugh]  (F: oh, yes, yes)  She has 
something from me.  And eh they, the kids doing theirs and doing crochet.  
F:
[door opens and closes]  Is this Mr. Silva?
S:
Yes it is (F: ah-hah) Mr. Silva.
F:
Hello, Mr. Silva.
S:
He's going to come over.
F:
He wonders who I am.
[Mr. and Mrs. Silva talk in Portuguese for a few seconds]
S:
You can say good afternoon, no.  [laughs; both talk]  My husband speaks less than me.
F:
Oh-h-h.  I'm very ni--I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.  My name is Barbara Fertig.  (Mr. 
Silva:          Silva)  Yes.  Nice to meet you.  And you can tell him then in Portuguese what I'm 
doing here.
S:
Uhm, I already told him before he co--  (F: oh you did)  [speaks in Portuguese for 10 or 
15 sec.; Mrs. Silva and interviewer laugh; door opens and closes]  
F:
Now is this, is this a traditional pattern?  Is this something that--
S:
It's, it's er, er--we have different, different patterns.  (F: uh-huh)  Very different patterns.  
Oh-h, I don't know where I do have more of these--I have a--
F:
[interrupts]  Oh, I bet you've done all of this, haven't you?
S:
Yes, I did this one, (F: yes) too.  This one eh, this one it's different from this one.  (F: 
mm-hm)  Very different.  You can see.  They're, they're all       .
F:
I'm going to take some pictures of those, too, if you don't mind.
S:
No, I don't.  I-I can take this out and show it.  
F:
And I guess I'll ask you, now, although this is very premature--  [telephone rings]  Oh, 
here let me undo you and uh--
[pause in tape]
F:
Um, since you've been here for twenty years you, you may have seen this neighborhood 
change, and I wondered if you had.  Has it changed?  
S:
Yes have changing a lot.  I'm going to be honest.  When I come this country I was a little 
upset the way the streets, the house, they were.  Because I'm going to tell you in the Azores it 
was different.  We have mens sweeping the streets and everything.  (F: mm-hm)  Now it's a big, 
big difference.  I don't know why it's most Portuguese people leaving.  They bought the old 
houses, they fix it, they [turning] like new houses.  They make the gardens.  The streets now--I 
think it's the city [then].  They have people cleaning the streets so I think uh we have now a 
beautiful city.  Beautiful city really.  (F: mm-hm)  But it's having a lot of change, a lot of change. 
The-e-e--I, I hopes the some other people to do things like that.  Now we having an--now 
ah--neighborhood.  They make it, a new [corns] over there where it's a the [Ghetto] shoe.  (F: 
mm-hm)  But in front they are leaving some people from like Cambodians, and-- (F:  mm-hm) 
and I wish somebody did something to take off all this garbage they are putting on the streets 
outside and--  (F: mm-hm)  To do something because it's our city.  What we do, it's for us.  (F: 
mm-hm)  Ah-h-h I, I love to, [chuckles] to see things neat and clean and--  (F: mm-hm, I can tell)
Oh.  (F: I can tell that you do)  Thank you.  [laughs]  Thank you.  So, ah-h-h, it was a big, big 
difference in everything, everything.  (F: mm-hm)  Everything changed.  (F: mm-hm)  
Everything changed.  This house, you remember.  (F: no, no I--)  On Chapel Street-- no? (F: no) 
Chapel Street, special--Chapel Street these back roads was real mess, this house very old.  
M-m-windows, broken windows; (F: mm-hm) the kids throwing stones through the windows.  
See the people live, wasn't living the house.  The, if they know nobody's living the house, they 
broke all the windows.  They used (F: mmm) to--we can't see it around now any more.  No, I 
don't see it.
F:
No.  These were houses that weren't lived in? They had just, people had just left them?
S:
Yes.  (F: yes)  People w-w-was leaving the house, moving for another place or (F: 
uh-huh) for some reasons.  That's it.  It's what are the kids doing.  (F: mm-hm)  I think they're 
kids.  I don't mean kids, kids.  They--sometimes it's crazy people.
F:
And then um, and then new people came from Portugal.  (S: now, yes, now, new people)  
And, and they took those houses (S: this house) with (S: they have been--) the broken windows 
and everything and they fixed them (S: yes) all up. 
S:
If you saw those house you say they're nobody's going to live in those houses.  People are
crazy to buy that.  I was thinking to buy some with my husband because he, my late husband, (F:
mm-hm) he was a carpenter (F: mm-hm) in Portugal.  He could do it.  But, I said "How much 
money we going to expend over here?"  But they were real cheap this time.  Do you believe that 
time that kind house I'm talking about like three, three floors, three tenements, (F: mm-hm) right.
(F: mm-hm)  They could, they were selling this for seven, seven and a half thousand dollars.  
Seven-- (F: oh my!) seven thousand do--seven thousand (F: mm-hm) dollars.  A single house.  I 
remember one house, a single house on Cedar Street, it was sold for two thousand dollars.  A 
single house.  Small, was (F: mm-hm) small, but that people get there, they did the beautiful--
[end of side one]
S:
They bought a new house on Dracut, a beautiful house.  (F: mm-hm)  Because they make 
money on that house.  (F: mm-hm)  You see the house [live]--especially the price of the house 
you can't, can't believe.  (F: mm-hm)  They going to a--
F:
I understand it's very expensive these days.
S:
Very expensive, very expensive.  I bought that house twelve years ago.  (F: this house?)  
This house.  For twenty thousand dollars.  (F: ah-h; well you have a very nice house)  [interrupts]
And somebody told me, somebody told me I was, I was doing a mistake because it isn't worth 
twenty thousand dollars.  I made some, some improvements, but not much.  Now, I think I can 
sell for one hundred fifty.  (F: mm-hm, mm-hm; I'm sure you could sell--)  [interrupts]  Because 
it's everything new, I cou-- (F: mm-hm) plan, plan this, planning and everything (F: mm-hm) I 
put everything (F: mm-hm) new so.  (F: mm-hm)
F:
But would you want to leave here?
S:
[If you want to live here?]  Y-y--
F:
Would, would you want to, to move away from here?
S:
Sometimes I think I should sell the house and go to another place.  But, [interviewer 
laughs] I love this house.  (F: oh, yes it's nice)  And it's a very quiet place.  (F: mm-hm)  It's a 
very quiet neighborhood.  (F: mm-hm)  So, for a while I'm going to stay over (F: mm-hm) here.  
God knows what's going to (F: mm-hm) happen now.  [chuckles]
F:
Where, where would you go?
S:
I don't know.  [both talk]  Sometimes I th-, I think "Could I go to Portugal and live there 
very well?"  Doing nothing with my pension and-- (F: mm-hm)  But I have my children and my 
grandchildrens over here.  (F: mm-hm)  I think I'm going to die very soon when I get [chuckles]  
(F: oh yes) without that.  (F: yes)  We are a very close family, (F: mm-hm) and eh so--  I plan 
sometimes to go to Florida, to go someplace like other people, get retired (F: mm-hm) to Florida.
(F: mm-hm)  But, I don't know.
F:
Is Mr. Silva retired?
S:
No, he's not.  He's not retired.  And the, I still couldn't be retired.  I took the [sudden] 
retirement plan from Wang Laboratories, (F: mm-hm) that's why I'm home and--  I was tired to 
be home and--  I was doing crocheting [interviewer laughs] and other things but I, I, I got this 
part, part-time job and I (F: mm-hm) love it.  I love it.  I like to be involved, I like to be, ah, eh to
be needed.  (F: mm-hm) [chuckles]  I guess people going there, now, when I get there they used 
to talk to the girl was in the cash.  Now they, every people comes to me.  "Mary, could you 
please do this for me, (F: mm-hm) do you please do that for me," because everybody needs to 
sew something.  (F: mm-hm)  Some things are a, needs always.  (F: mm-hm)  Somethings (F: 
mm-hm) even they bought in the store, they come with eh (F: yes) what's, (F: uh-huh) come.  
[radio or tv starts playing] It's hems, it's everything.  (F: mm-hm)  To change old (F: uh-huh) 
clothes for new clothes.  [chuckles]  (F: mm-hm)
F:
Tell me, are there, are there um--I should, I guess--how should I say this.  Um, do you, do
you celebrate the feast of the Holy Ghost here?  
S:
[both talk]  What do you mean?  (F: I mean, do you, oh I'm, well I guess I meant--)  If I 
used to go to the Holy Ghost?  (F: yes)  Yes.  (F: uh-huh)  I uh, matter of fact yesterday I did go 
there to, to mark a table for the New Year's Eve, because I-I (F: oh) can't stay home on New 
Year's Eve.  [interviewer chuckles]  I used to go out for--eh, oo, they going to have a beautiful 
dance, (F: uh-huh) and a dinner, the dinner and eh, and eh--  Th-they serve very well food, very 
(F: mm-hm) good food.  (F: mm-hm)  So I'm planning to go with my family. (F: mm-hm)
F:
And, and do you go out to the feast every year, to the celebration?
S:
Yes, I used to.  (F: mm-hm)  I used to.  (F: mm-hm)  And eh even anoth-another parties 
they usually to, usually to go with the, the        sort of people.  A lot of times they have feasts 
over there, and I used (F: mm-hm) to go.  I used to go.  I love to go there.  (F: mm-hm)
F:
And, in Fayal, did they have um Holy Ghost Society?
S:
Eh-eh-eh yes.  In Fayal we have a, a very special site in the Holy Ghost in Portugal.  It's 
very special.  In Portugal, I mean Azores.  (F: mm-hm)  And eh Azores they, especially in the 
summer they have, you know, this crown of (F: mm-hm) Holy Ghost?  (F: mm-hm)  They have 
eh, they go into the church.  The people have eh--i-it's going buy, buy, buy tickets.  They uh, (F: 
mm-hm) they have, they take eh tickets and the, the Holy Ghost is supposed to go like two or 
three or four people in (F: mm-hm) a year.  Suppose you have one month at the Holy Ghost, 
another month I'm going to your home to take the Holy Ghost to my home.  (F: mm-hm)  You 
have something, you have a table with food that (F: uh-huh) people ser--have, they eat [together],
(F: mm-hm) and they take the Holy Ghost to their homes after they go to another home.  And eh,

part, real Portugal, continental, (F: mm-hm) they, they know that is eh Holy Ghost but they don't

was in their house that there was peace in the family, that nobody argued and so forth.  Is that a--
S:

you.  (F: okay)  Do you remember--that's why I'm in this country.  Whe--it's the volcano in the, in
the Fayal, Azores.  (F: oh, that's right)  A big volcano.  And one night it was four hundred fifty 
tremors.  Ah, ha, h-ha, (F: oh) ha, hachay-- (F: earthquake)  Earthquakes.  (F: earthquakes)  
Earthquakes.  (F: mm-hm)  And eh the time was a President Kennedy.  Kennedy was the 
President.  (F: mm-hm)  That's why everbody have someone in this country.  Oh my God.  Um it 
was possiblity then (F: mm-hm) could come to this country.  Doesn't have to be American or 
something.  (F: mm-hm)  Oh everybody.  That's why my sister come to this country.  And after I 
stay there, so after she make me a petition.  Well, but besides this or I was telling you, when it 
was this, that night we have this all this earthquakes.  The peop--the police in the, the 
government that go--the fire, the fire department, everybody's they go to that, that town to take 
all the people out from there, because it was starting a volc--a new volcano (F: mm-hm) over 
there.  [In the sea, at the sea.]  And eh, all the people--th-th-they was [buses] and cars.  
Everybody have a car have to go there to pick up their people to the city.  One couple, leaving 
their house, right.  And she was eh making bread because this people in the countries make they 
own breads for (F: mm-hm) themselves.  (F: yes)  They were making bread.  And the--it's in 
the--now we can make bread in this stoves, in this-- (F: mm-hm) but that time it's, it's one big 
stove built, and the people put like, like a (F: oh) bakery.  (F: uh-huh)  The, (F: uh-huh) the 
bread. (F: mm-hm)  So they get--it was in October, and it was cold and they were v-very warm 
with (F: mm-hm) all the heat the, the, from the oven, (F: mm-hm) and they said well--but they 
have the Holy Ghost at home that time.  And they said, we are not, we are not going to outside 
because it's too cold!  We can get sick.  (F: mm-hm)  And one corner of the house fall.  And they 
took the Holy Ghost to another corner.  And they move for that corner.  All the corners were 
falling, but they took always the Holy Ghost with them.  It's true, it's, (F: mm-hm) it's a           but
it's true.  So it was at night.  In the morning they still alive.  Nobody's d-dead with this, this thing.
It was very bad but nobody dead.  And it was in the morning and they come outside and they see 
what happened to another people in another house.  But they didn't know they take all the people 
to the city.  They didn't know.  (F: oh)  They came outside and they didn't see anybody.  They 
said just saw all the house down, the church and everything.  They found themselves alone.  And 
they started walking, and one car comes over.  A p--the police car.  T-t-to, to check if somebody 
was back.  (F: mm-hm)  Was this couple with the Holy Ghost in their hands.  That's that.  They 
brou-brought him back to the city.  And that happens to them.
F:
Uh-huh.  And they were the only ones left?
S:
The only one left in that town.  (F: mmm)  Only ones.  They didn't know they was taking 
the people.  They were           peo--some people like eh old people, they saw if they go outside 
and they go for a walk. Some people living another times, they was iron with this, irons with coal
(F: mm-hm) not (F: mm-hm) electrical.  They didn't go outside, [chuckles] they were afraid.  (F: 
yeah, oh)  So, it happens, it was true.  (F: mm-hm)  That's not a--a fairy story.  (F: mm-hm)  It's 
true, really.  Eh-h all the people was out of the house, it come to a big park and it's very far.  (F: 
mm-hm)  Nobody's have nothing to eat.  We just have--some have supper, some dinner, because 
it started eh, it like was like this, not (F: mm-hm) too--not dark, not too--the sun was going down
already, (F: mm-hm) and eh, it start shaking and shaking.  All the city, all the island.  (F: mm)  
And they come to this park, and there are a maybe two old womens they were going, they was 
going to some, going to begging (F: mm-hm) around, they have, have a bag with some bread.  
People like--you get a piece of bread, she's going to another house, another person (F: mmm) 
give another piece of bread.  So this old woman, women was giving to us a piece of those bread 
they were asking for.  (F: ohhh)  Was real very sad.  (F: mmm)
F:
Did you lose your home, during that earthquake?
S:
Ehh, not really.  Have a, a few, a few (F: cracks?) cracks, a few (F: mm-hm) cracks but eh
in the city wasn't as bad as it was in that eh, that (F: in the village) village, village.  (F: mm-hm)  
Everythings go down (F: mm-hm) everything, everything.  When it start the volcano, the volcano
it makes a new island.  We have a new island.  (F: [laughs] you have a new island, wow)  Oh, 
yes.  It, it--because suppose this is Fayal, and it start, start like over here in the sea.  (F: uh-huh)  
The, the, the water comes out and out and was putting the, the sand and all the fumes and all this 
stuff.  It was going the same, was building and building an island.  And this island gets co--uh, to
get, to get [both talk] (F: --connected) connected with (F: uh-huh) another one.  
F:
And at that point your sister decided to come to America?  (S: [whispers] yes; yes)  Did 
she say "That's enough," you know.  "I don't like volcanoes."
S:
Yeah.  I, I, I, I left there first thing, but I did go to another island to stay, because I was 
very much afraid.  (F: mm-hm)  Very much afraid.  So I did go that island, (F: mm-hm) and after 
she started to come to--over here she--my--sending my brother-in-law, he have a, a, an uncle 
over here in this country.  (F: mm-hm)  And he wrote to him and ask him if he want t-to make 
the, this responsibility.  (F: mm-hm)  Send for them and he did.  And they come this isl--this 
country.  (F: mm-hm)  Seven years after, eight years after they did go to visit us and ask me if I 
like to come over.  I just have that sister, so I come over.  (F: mm-hm) 
F:
Did your mother come with you at the time?  I don't remember.
S:
[interrupts]  No.  No, no my mother stayed back; (F: yes) for a while.  (F: that's right, she 
came--)  And she came ah-ah-ah (F: when she was eighty) two years, maybe two years after I 
was over (F: mm-hm) here.  She comes to live (F: mm-hm) with me.  She comes visit, like eh 
visiting the country (F: mm-hm) after my sister.  This time I still wasn't an American citizen, (F: 
mm-hm) but my sister was.  So, she make a petition for her, and she stay with me (F: mm-hm) all
the time.  (F: mm-hm)  [pause: 5 sec.]  And that's my life in this country. 
F:
[sighs]  Um, well it sounds like we've gained quite a good citizen I think.  [Mrs. Silva 
laughs]  Um, are there any other traditions you want to tell me about, or anything else about the 
neighborhood that I might not have asked you?
S:
Not really.  The way they would rai-raise this children, it's very different from the way 
they are raising this country.  (F: mm-hm)  Ah, I never, never--my children did go to the streets, 
just to play in the streets.  (F: mm-hm)  And even in this country I raised my grandchildren, but 
they never, never did go play in the streets.  (F: mm-hm)  I don't believe in it.  (F: mm-hm)  I 
don't.  They play in my yards, in my home, but not in the streets.  And the kids, the girls or boys, 
but girls, especially girls, going to school at six, five, six years.  And ehh, they go and study, they
like to study.  If they don't like to study, they can learn some skills like sewing. That time--now I 
think everything I heard I think it's different, too.  But that time most the girls, most the girls 
going to learn to, how to sew.  (F:  mm-hm)  And eh they have, they make a life from that, (F: 
mm-hm) from this eh (F: mm-hm) thing.  And eh, it's that it--they get married and have children 
all right.  And they don't go to work out, just the husbands work, not the, the wives.  (F: mm-hm)
If they know how to, to, how to sew and go to do something at home for somebody, they (F: 
mm-hm) used to do at home.  But I don't used to wor--over here everybody's going to work; all 
the wives, all the daughters, al--no, we don't do this in the--in our country that time.  (F: mm-hm)
Now I heard it's different, eh.  W-well, I was a Portuguese teacher.  I did go to work out, I did go 
(F: mm-hm) to teach.  (F: mm-hm)  But most--ehh, but it's like the girls went for teachers or, or 
secretaries, or secretaries, or-or-or (F: mm-hm) some, some thing.   But it's not, it's not 
everybody like today.  [chuckles]  It's different, very different. (F: [talks at same time] yes, yes, 
now it is everybody, mm-hm)  They stay home and their husbands have their responsibility, too.  
They are a, a provider.  (F: mm-hm)  It's the husbands.  And they just--they care, the husbands; 
the house, the [clothes], the children, that's that.  (F: mm-hm)  Now everything it's different in 
this country.   When we come this country we can find a very big difference, very big difference. 
I adapted very well, but in--even my children, I was surprised with my children.  When they 
come to this countr--they--you know where they start working?  At this um, you know, 
Hathaway.  They doing--the some mens' shirts.  (F:  oh, the, the Hathaway Shirt Company)  
Hathaway Shirt.  (F: uh-huh)  They did go there.  I was surprised.  They never complained.  So I 
was sorry for them.  They gets tired, they      time to study and I don't want to see them just (F: 
mm-hm) doing (F: mm-hm) their job.  I did go to the um, International Institute.  Was near 
the--do you--Mrs. [Mello] there, do you know--do you remember Mrs. [Mello]?  (F: well, I've 
heard a recording--)  [interrupts]  Yes.  (F: --she made; I never--)  [interrupts]  Yes.  (F: --met her;
mm-hm)  Oh she's a nice, nice lady.  (F: mm-hm)  The Portuguese can say she was their mother.  
And she--I talked to her and I said "Well, my, my girls aren't doing th-, eh--"  She said "Why 
don't you bring them over here?  Bring Stella."  It's the one it's in Maryland, (F: mm-hm) she was
always very smart.  I did go there with her.  And she starts speaking English with her.  And she 
spoke with her.  (F: uh-huh)  And eh, she told me "It's the first one comes from Portugal who can 
speak as good as she does."  (F: oh!)  Because.  (F: uh-huh)  And eh she, she get a job for her.  
She was em to the Skill Center.  (F: mm-hm)  You know the Skill Center?  (F: no, I don't, but--)  
[interrupts]  Ah Skill Center was--there's um--was in the          Street.  There's a Mr. [Dejeunes] is
the, the director in the--oh--  It's an organization to help people who comes from the, the--another
countries.  (F: uh-huh)  [pause: 5 sec.; goes through papers]  Uh well, you just call the Skill 
Center because (F: okay) the people was going there (F: mm-hm) learnin--to--eh using-- they, 
they were paid for that; for being that school.  (F: mmm)  Was a very nice program.  They still 
have but they are helping now more this people comes from this eh--Asian, (F: uh-huh) Asian (F:
uh-huh) people.  (F: uh-huh)  And that's nice because they need it, too, you know.  (F: mm-hm)  
And um--  So, she was there and it was the first step.  She started going up and up, until I can tell
you, she's the Portuguese girl in the, this in the city who have a better job.  Nobody's got a job 
like that.  (F: ah-hah)  She have a very good pay.  (F: uh-huh)  She's--every--  (F: mm-hm)  She 
start in Honeywell.  She work ten years for the Honeywell, and after the people--pe-people going
together in meetings, they was asked to go to work for another companies for more money and 
she's going.  She's thirty-six years old.
F:
And she's--and so she was sixteen when she came here?  Did they come with you?
S:
Llll--ex--they come with me.  (F: mm-hm)  So they have em--they--I come in nineteen 
ninety--nineteen eh, sixty-eight.  So she have eighteen years old.  (F: mm-hm)  Eighteen years.  
[sighs]  That's all I can s--
F:
And she's the eldest?  She's the oldest?
S:
No, no.  The, the--               , (F: uh-huh)  she's the youngest.  (F: oh)  It's two daughters 
(F: uh-huh) [chuckles]             .  [pause: 10 sec.]
F:
Well, I thank you very much.
S:
You welcome.  I hope I could help better, but my English poor.
F:
You've helped a lot.  (S: you know--)  I'm very grateful.
S: 
I s--I, I don't know if I told you, I worked two years in a Great Shoe and I come home, as 
I told you, (F: mm-hm) to raise my grandchildren.  I like my grandchildren to learn Portuguese.  
My daughter-in-law she's I-Irish, but Christina, my, my granddaughter, she's the one speaks 
Portuguese better.  Not now, now she's in school and they go to school and they stop talking 
Portuguese.  (F: uh-huh)  So my English poor because eh I never talk English with them.  I 
always--I can read, I can read anything.  (F: mm-hm)  I can, and I can write better than I can talk 
because I wanted them to learn Portuguese so ten years I stay in this house raising my 
grandchildren.  [laughs]  (F: uh-huh, uh-huh)  So, now.  That's it.  But they know some 
Portuguese.  [both talk at once]  (F: I'm sure they'll come back to it)  And they can talk some 
Portuguese.  (F: I'm sure they'll come back to it)  Oh, yes.  (F: yes)  And sometimes it's very 
needed for the--some jobs.  (F: mm-hm)  Special--they ah--I think we have about eighteen 
thousand Portuguese people in this city.  (F: in Lowell?)  In Lowell.  (F: mmm)  I think it's a lot.  
(F: mm-hm)  We have eighteen about two years ago, I don't know.  It's always coming.  (F: 
uh-huh)  [chuckles]  (F: I understand that, yes)
F:
All right, thank you.  (S: okay, thank you very--)
