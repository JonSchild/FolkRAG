INSANITY. 
Written by JAMES S. 
KELLY, and performed by KELLY k O'BRIEN. 
with great success. 
While running down the street one afternoon, 
For to catch a 
butterfly, 
I 
jammed my head into a 
big spittoon, 
• 
Oh, how is that for high. 
Kaiser don't you want to buy a 
dog, 
Or a 
sixteen carat pin. 
There never was a 'coward where the shamrock grows. 
With a 
bunion on her shin. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, you can't catch me, 
(Break.) 
I 
feel just as happy as .Tack Aberle; 
They call me a 
big bar, of hay. 
Six limes I 
lost my peck, 
Good evening white folks one and all, 
I've a 
gum bile on my neck. 
Oh, here I 
am a 
champion gay, 
Singing, dancing all the day, 
A 
regular Hanky Panky cove, 
I'm all dressed up in my Sunday clothes. 
I 
carry a 
razor in my sock, 
They say my face would stop a 
clock, 
I 
work out here a 
blasting rock, 
Oh, how is that for low. 
I 
put on style with my stand-up collar, 
When I 
sing I 
never holler, 
Yon can bet your bottom dollar 
I 
never miss a 
meal. 
When I 
bear th music playing 
I 
rattle off my heel and toe, 
I'm Erastus lIenry Johnson, 
And I've got tar upon my heel. 
Written and sung by JAMES T. 
KELLY of KELLY & 0 '
Bruns, in the 
great novelty act, " Insanity.' 
I'm a 
ringtail squealer from Japan, 
Mary Ann, Pat McCann 
And little Sally Waters, 
With her seventy-five daughters. 
Playing seven-up in Olean. 
I'm going to take a 
trip to Phily-ma-Clink, 
Phily-ma-Clink, Phily-ma-Clink. 
I'm going to Atlantic City, 
For to sing a 
comic ditty, 
Oh, Sally bless my sowl, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Sall Brown, 
(Symphony.) 
Oh, Browny Sally, 
I'm going to take a 
trip to Coney Isle, 
Biddy Doyle she had a 
bile, 
I'm going to Atlantic Cit, 
To sing a 
comic ditty, 
Oh, bless my sowl. 
We'll raise up the clinkers from the stove, 
By Jove, you're a 
cove, 
I 
can do a 
hundred flippers, 
When I 
wear the golden slippers, 
Mary Ann McLaughlin that's above. 
I'm going out West on a 
farm, 
To hoe the corn sure's your birn, 
And little Tommy Dinkle, 
With his twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, 
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle little star. 
Words and music by JAMES T. 
KELLY, expressly for DAN SULLY, and 
sung by him with great success, also by KELLY SZ 
You talk about your German Band out on a 
rainy day, 
t 
Playing " Mollie Darling," or " Coming through the Hay;" 
With turn up toes and fiery nose they think that they look 
grand, 
But the pride of all the wind jammers is Kelly's Tin-pot 
Band. 
With my ra-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, the music it did p-1-a-y. [Repeat. 
Cnonus: 
The ladies smile when they see our fairy faces, 
We march along together, all go hand in hand; 
As we pass down by their door we play Rory O'Moore, 
For style and execution has Kelly's Tin-pot Band. 
The band was called to order by President McKay, 
To form a 
grand committee for St. Patrick's Day; 
To have your shoes a 
shining to plough the dust and sand, 
For the pride of all the wind jammers is Kelly's Tin-pot 
Band. 
With my ra-ta-ta-ta, ta-ta, the music it did p-1-a-y. [Repeat.

AN IRISHMAN'S DYING REQUEST. 
Composed by JAMES T. 
KELLY, and recited by KELLY & O'BRIEN in 
their original act - Insanity." 
Norah, the gang upon the corner 
Has told me to lay down and die, 
My darling, go and hang up the baker 
For a 
piece of huckelberry pie; 
My breath is getting very weak, 
Once, you know, it Ak as so strong, 
So listen to my dying request, 
For I 
know that I 
will not live long. 
Tell my brother, Herman Fagan, 
The poor man to-day he got one year, 
Tell him when I 
go to Sandusky 
I'm going to give up drinking beer; 
Oh, the happy days we spent together, 
When we used to call each other chumps. 
No more we will parade the Bowery 
Dropping our hats on cigar stumps. 
Tell my red-headed hump-backed sister 
She ought to put herself in hock. 
She puts me in mind of a 
bag of peanuts. 
Or a 
hole in the heel of a 
woolen sock 
"414 
AN IRISHMAN'S DYING REQUEST—CONTINUED. 
Norah, our little dog has fleas, 
We must shake the dizzy pup, 
Come and kiss me when I'm dead, 
For then I 
know I 
won't throw up. 
Tell your father he's a 
darling, 
As a 
lusher he takes the cake; 
Tell him to buy some bad gin and tobacco 
So the gang can enjoy themselves at my wake; 
Tell him to sing the Starry Banner, 
For it I 
carried many a 
night; 
Tell them all I 
came from Cork, 
And that's the reason I'm flying light. 
Norah, part my hair in the middle, 
I 
think my end is drawing near; 
I 
wish you would go to the corner gin mill 
And hang them up for a 
quart of beer. 
Farewell, darling, it's time I 
was dead, 
Good afternoon, oh, what do you say? 
If any one asks why I 
kicked the bucket 
Tell them I 
couldn't stay away.

Words and music by JAMES T. 
KELLY. 
Sung with immense success at Tony Pastor's Theatre by 
KELLY 4.S: 
O'BRIEN. 
-:0:-
Guess who we are you can have us awhile, 
We've cologne on our ulsters and sweet-scented lie; 
We make up our eyebrows with prepared chalks, 
They call us two mossbacks and two big jay hawks. 
We work up in Harlem protecting the Flats, 
And often go gunning for old Thomas cats; 
They gave us three dollars but we stuck out for five, 
And then they said kick it, and see if it's alive. 
We are going over to Europe to play the bazoo, 
Along with Pat Rooney and Mickey McGrew; 
We will show them a 
turn they never saw before, 
And if we don't make a 
hit we'll make the back door, 
And if we fall flat we'll go down to three balls, 
And insure our lives at Walla HaIla Halls; 
We will then go to Italy for an organ and monkey, 
And cross the blue ocean with J. Rial's donkey.

JAMES A. GARFIELD'S GRAVE. 
Written and composed by J. W. KELLY, and sung by K ELLY and 
O'BRIEN', with great success. 
The steady step and muffled drum the cortege passed along. 
A 
dreadful silence reigned supreme amid the mighty throng; 
The somber tolling of the bells remind we must, 
In time just like our President returned from dust to dust. 
Men with heads uncovered would utter GuiteMi's name, 
And the feeling of each one, I 
am certain, was the same; 
And if from jail he once was free no power on earth could 
save, 
The man that sent our President to his untimely grave. 
You saw the streets in mourning whichever way you'd go, 
A.nd every one their sympathy in some way tried to show. 
By many a 
wife and mother a 
fervent prayer was said, 
And taught it to their little ones before they went to lad. 
And wAcn the sufferer was laid in his last resting place, 
There came an aged colored man and tears ran down his 
iace; 
lie brought a 
little bouquet with a 
card marked " Uncle 
Da v 
e ; " 
lie plucked them wild twas all he had for Master Garfield's 
grave. 
How sad it was indeed to see that patient. hopeful wife, 
And gray-haired mother who for him would gladly give her 
life; 
how different were their feelings when around him they 
did stand. 
When honored with the highest place there is in our free 
land. 
Let's hope that his successor will be as fit to rule, 
And be a 
man that can't be made a 
politician's fool; 
Then peaceful rest the ashes of a 
soldier true and brave, 
And a 
nation's tears will moist the earth on James A. 
Garfield's grave.

Good Bye Polly, 
Sung with great success by EDWIN BARRY at the Theatre Comive, 
I 
loved a 
girl named Polly, and thought that she loved me, 
So joined a 
ship to take a 
trip across the briny sea, 
And when the morning had arrived for me to sail away, 
I 
gave the lass a 
parting kiss, and then to her did say: 
CHORUS. 
Good bye Polly, I 
must leave you, 
Let us hope the parting will not grieve you, 
The ship it sails to- day, some thousand miles away; 
So think of me when I 
am on the sea. 
She vowed that she'd be true to me while I 
was away, 
And thinking what she said was right, I 
left her my half pay; 
Then with a 
sigh bid her good-bye, and as they heaved the lead, 
I 
left her standing on the shore, then jumped aboard and said; 
Good bye, Polly, & c. 
I 
saw her in my dreams at night, I 
thought of her all day, 
But did not think that she was false to me, when far away; 
For I 
must own when I 
alone, was lying on my bed, 
I 
often woke up in a 
fright, and these w6rds have said: 
Good bye, Polly, & c. 
Some years had passed when I 
returned, with lots of gold 
in store, 
And just you fancy my surprise, when I 
knocked at the doo.o 
They told me Poll was married, she had been false to me, 
So now no more I'll stP., 
shore, I'm off again to sea. 
Good bye, Polly, &c.

Siuce the Railroads Have Cut Down 
the Fares. 
Written by DEN MORTON and sung by FORD 8: KNOWLES, at Harry 
Miner's New Theatre, Bowery, N. Y. 
The railroad monopolists got into a 
row, 
And the people look on at the fight. 
Jay Gould and Vanderbilt put on the gloves, 
And like bull pups they clinch and they bite. 
The Erie is leary, the New York Central is mad, 
Wall Street Bulls stick their horns in the Bears. 
Sammy Tilden got busted and has to work a 
free lunch, 
Since the railroads have cut down the fares. 
As by old Bowery bummers you're braced on the street, 
They'll ask in a 
voice so distressed: 
" 
Please lend me three cents, a 
ticket I'll buy 
For Kalamazoo in the West." 
Jim Blaine and Conkling about it had a 
row, 
They're now in the Tombs for repairs, 
They sent Conkling to Sing Sing for hugging Sprague's 
• 
wife, 
Since the railroads have cut down the fares. 
Old Beecher now preaches while he stands on his head, 
Yet the Plymouth church girls call him dear. 
He and Bob Ingersoll have doubled up, 
And their working oid kegs for stale beer. 
They are using. John Kelly's chromo as a 
poison for rats, 
Into fits Mayor Grace now he scares, 
They use Captain Williams for a 
street cleaning broom ; 
Since the railroads have cut down the fares.

Empty Is The Stable, Davy's Gone. 
Written by BEN COLLINS. COPYRIGHTED, 1881, by A. 
J. 
FISHER 
Sung with great success by LESTER & W ILLIAMS. 
I 
used to own a 
donkey, a 
bob-tail stubborn mule, 
He was born about the year of '49; 
His head was full of scars from stopping Railroad ears, 
He was ring-boned, spavined, deaf and blind; 
He could kick a 
steam engine, and raise you through 
the roof, 
And send you where Bob Ingersoll belongs; 
He died at half past four, he's gone to that beautifu' 
shore, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
CHORUS: 
Gone to join the angels with spit-curls on his hair, 
Died with epizootic in the head; 
He might have gone to Congress if he only lived, 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
His hoof was like a 
slungshot, he could raise you 
through the roof, 
He'd come into the house and kick you out of bed; 
His feet was full of bunions, he could eat a 
barrel of 
onions, 
And go to sleep a 
standing on hi's head; 
He'd go to a 
saloon, shove his hoof through a 
spittoon 
And kick the bar into the gutter for a 
joke, 
When he laid down and died, every mule in Jersey died 
Empty is the stable, Davy's gone. 
Cnours: 
Davy's left the stable for the promised land, 
His overshoes and saddle are in pawn; 
No more hay he'll ever chew, they've turned him into 
glue, 
Empty is the stable Davy's gone.

I've a 
farm out in the West, it's a 
farm that is the best, 
I've a 
hump-back mule with freckled red hair; 
Then I 
had one Texas steer, with a 
wart on his left ear, 
But he's croaked now and he's climbed the golden stair 
Then my poor old Shanghigh rooster who in battle nobly 
fell, 
With O'Brien's bull dog he fought long and brave; 
And the only thing that keeps me from going out and get. 
ting full, 
Is this feather from my Shanghigh rooster's grave. 
Crtotrus: 
His comb was like a 
tooth brush, his spurs were like an ax. 
His tombstone was a 
sugar hogshead stave; 
ais wife is out in the barn, sitting on two lumps of coal, 
She is mourning o'er my Shanghigh rooster's grave. 
No more he'll stop out late and come home at half-past 
eight, 
Singing Coc-a-doodle-do or good by Jake; 
No more he'll stop a 
brick that was fired at a 
torn cat, 
Or flirt with Bantams Pullets at the gate. 
He'll never crow again or wink at some old hen, 
He was a 
ma,ther and his maiden name was Dave; 
MI the hens are on a strike they haven't layed since 
Saturday night, 
For they are weeping o'er my Shanghigh rooster's grave.

'Twas a 
cold winter's night and the heat was oppressive, 
The rosebuds and the snowflakes covered cabin and stye, 
When Barney flew over the hills to the poor-house, 
And smit:-1E'd in the window where Katie did lie. 
Saving, Kathleen Mavourneen are you sleeping or eating, 
The landlord has tired me, my coat it is thin; 
Soho, Kathleen Mavourneen, you must let me in. 
(Spoken.) And the young girl turned round, and she said: 
Now, Barney, my bueko, you're giving me taffy, 
Do you mane for to say you have no place to snooze, 
You spent eight thousand dollars at the picnic last Sunday, 
With that red-headed, fiery-faced Mary Jane Hughes; 
But take this mosquito bar, and this linen duster; 
The night's bitter cold, and you're coat it is thin; 
For what has a 
poor tramp but her feet to defend her, 
No, Barney, my bucko, I'll not let you in. 
(There, now, go home). 
OH I 
FRED, TELL THEM TO STOP. 
Written and composed by GEORGE MEEN. 
Sang by EDWIN BARRY. 
His latest hit. 
No doubt you have heard of the great fancy fair, 
That used to take place every day; 
Well, I 
thought for amusement I'd take my girl there 
To pass a 
dull hour away; 
We went in you must know, and saw Barnum's show, 
Van Amburgh's menagerie, as well; 
There were round-about swings, and all kinds of things 
Forget the day I 
never shall. 
DIALOGUE. — Yes! when we got in the fair, my girl 
wanted to have a 
ride in the swing. 
I 
said. all right, my 
darling; but directly the swing went a 
little too high, sh9 
lustily cried— 
CHORUS: 
Oh, Fred, tell them to stop, 
That was the cry of Maria; 
The more she said whoa, they said, let it go, 
And the swing went a 
little bit higher. 
'The people that stood round of course they all laughed 
But I 
only said, stop the swing; 
There were four or five others in boats beside us, 
Saying, master don't do such a 
thing; 
Then four or five roughs caught hold of the ropes, 
Maria fell down on her knees; 
And one of them said, the young man's getting red, 
But isn't he having a 
spree. 
l)iAG 
LorE.—And Maria still cried out at the top of her 
voice—  
(Chorm,), 
They soon stopped the swing, Maria jumped out, 
And quickly fell down on the floor; 
They brought her some water, which soon brought 
her to, 
The girl I 
now do adore; 
Should you ever go there, to the great fancy fair, 
Friends, take advice while I 
sing; 
Of the great round-about, it's the best fun that's out. 
And finish the day with a 
swing. 
DIALOGUE.—And when you take a 
girl with you, make 
her promise she won't call out— (Chorus).

I'll take you home again, Kathleen, 
Across the ocean wild and wide; 
To where your heart has ever been, 
Since first you were my bonny bride; 
The roses all have left your cheek, 
I've watched them fade away and die; 
Your voice is sad when e'er you speak, 
And tears bedim your loving eyes. 
Clionus: 
Oh, I 
will take you back, Kathleen, 
To where your heart will feel no pain; 
And when the fields are fresh and green, 
I'll take you to your home again. 
I 
know you love me, Kathleen, dear, 
Your heart was ever fond-and true: 
I 
always feel when you are near, 
That life holds nothing dear but you. 
The smiles that once you gave to me, 
I 
scarcely ever see them now; 
Tho' many, many time. I 
gee 
A dark'ning

On a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Such a 
pretty letter, with its perfume sweet, 
Cupid's with their arrows loving hearts to meet, 
Lots of blots for kisses, and a 
seal of blue, 
Meaning that my love is true to you. 
CHORUS. 
For on a 
bright summer morning I 
pursued my way, 
As happy as a 
robin when he trills his lay, 
That morning such a 
letter from my true love came, 
Commencing with " My Dearest," and concluding with her 
name. 
Now who the letter came from I 
of course must tell, 
A charming little maiden, and her name is Belle, 
She's just as sweet as honey, and she writes to me— 
You see that we are parted, she is far across the sea. 
If you've ever been in love, of course you'll understand 
The feelings of my heart, when loving letters reach your hand, 
How 
you'll stand and wonder what your sweetheart she has said, 
As I 
did, with the one that I 
have read. 
For on a 
bright summer, & c. 
Of course I'm going to answer in a 
true love strain, 
And ask my little darling to return again, 
And soon a 
ship that's sailing o'er the dark blue sea, 
Will bring me such a 
letter, from my sweetheart it will be. 
Then when we are married, I 
will write you all the news, 
Tell you how we get along, and never have the blues, 
What a 
little treasure wife I 
got from o'er the sea, 
Our letters then will spell L- O-V- E. 
For on a 
bright summer. Fcc.

BREACH OF PROMISE CASE. 
Sang by NED BARRY with great success at HARRIGAN & HART'S 
Theatre Comique, N. Y. 
Once I 
loved Matilda Minking, 
Once Matilda she loved me; 
Once we billed and cooed like winking, 
Once engaged to wed were we; 
Now all things are altered sadly, 
Our engagement's all U. P.; 
Matilda served me, oh! so badly, 
Silly old Cupid's up a 
tree. 
SPOKEN.—And I'm up a 
tree, too, for she who might 
have been my spouse, has made me pay for my broken 
vows, although— 
CHORUS: 
Once she loved me to distraction, 
Once she was beloved by me; 
Now she's gone and brought an action, 
Against her lover that used to be. 
Tilly in a 
shocking fashion, 
Flirted hard with ev'ry swell; 
Pilling me with rage and passion, 
So one day I 
said "- Farewell!" 
This, of course, raised Tilly's ire, 
Oh! you should have seen her face, 
Nothing at all would satisfy her, 
But a 
Breach of Promise Case. 
SPOKEN.—She said I 
had basely deserted her, but not 
she would not be trampled upon with impunity, (as if 
wanted to trample on her with anything at all). 
She had 
three hundred and forty-nine love letters of mine, and 
damages she would have. 
Oh! the inconsistency of woman. 
She said she was injured and yet she wanted further dam-
uges. 
She hated the sight of me, although— 
(Chortle), 
21 
BREACH OF PROMISE CASE.—CONTINUED. 
The case was tried, the Court was quite full, 
Everybody was there to see; 
They seemed to think the fun delightful, 
Sport to them was death to me; 
Tilly's lawyer to the jury, 
Bullied me beyond all bounds; 
The verdict was, oh! rage and fury, 
Damages, just one thousand Pounds. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, only a 
thousand; that's all. 
I 
could for, 
get that, and forgive Tilly, but never can I 
forgive that 
odious lawyer of hers, Jawkins, Q. C. 
Not content with 
calling me villain, forger, burglar, assassin and other mild 
epithets, he added injury to insult by reading my letters to 
tbe jury. 
This is one of them: 
Ng own Angelic Darling: 
I 
cannot retire to my lonely couch without once more 
pouring out to you the devotion of this heart that beats for 
thee, and thee alone, my beautiful, my own. 
Oh! what a 
paradise was ours as we stood upon the doorstep this 
evening, oblivious of all save love. 
No! No! I 
cannot re-
tire to my ; onely couch. 
I 
will watch o'er thee; the door-
step on which we stood shall be my couch, the scraper 
pr
essed by your seraphic boot, shall be my pillow. 
Sleep 
on! 
r 
He read that, and everybody laughed. 
Oh! I 
could 
smother him! I 
was so upset, that when the Judge asked 
me a 
question, I replied- (Chorus). 
Now I'm in a 
pretty pickle, 
With the cash I've had to pay; 
My Matilda false and fickle, 
Weds another man to- day; 
So ev'ry swain whom Cupid fetters, 
My advice should take I 
think; 
And always write their spooney letters, 
In Anti-Breach of Promise Ink. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, gentlemen! 
Whenever you write love 
letters, always be careful to use the Anti-Breach of Prom-
ise Ink, which fades (crag in a 
week or two after it is 
written. 
If you do this, you will never have occ(ca,

A 
VIOLET FROM MOTHER'S GRAVE. 
Words and Music by W ILL H. 
For. 
Sung by Wm. McALooN in all the principal Theatres in America, ant 
by O'NEIL & CONROY. 
Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of my childhood's happy days; 
When down in the meadow in childhood I 
would roam, 
But there's no one left to cheer now within my good 
old home; 
Father and Mother they have passed away, 
Sister and Brother are laid beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
CHORUS: 
Only a 
Violet I 
plucked when but a 
boy, 
And often when I'm sad at heart, this plant has 
give me joy; 
But while life does remain, in memorium I'll retain, 
That small violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave.. 
How well I 
remember my dear old Mother's smile, 
As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old arm chair, 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there; 
But now all is silent around the good old home, 
They all have left me in sorrow for to roam; 
While life does remain, there's one thing I'll retain, 
A small Violet I 
plucked from Mother's Grave. 
(Chorus).

As sung by JENNIE M ORGAN. 
Itri.sic to be had of OLIVER DITSON 
130StOD, Mass., Price .mota 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day. 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you., 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me , 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without ma. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me. 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that rise 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me ; 
A.h! no, I 
only fear that day. 
The day when yon'll forget me, 
The day when y0n11 orget rae.

Here She Goes and There She Goes. 
Originally sung by EDWIN BARRY, at Harrigan ee Hart's Theatre Comique 
Broadway, N. V. 
0 
When Tom declared his ardent love for Miss Amelia Brown, 
They asked papa to give consent, but he only gave a 
frown; 
Now Tom and his Amelia said that they'd elope to town, 
And married be, although it was against the wish of Brown , 
The very morning of their flight, old Brown at home would stay, 
I 
know they only wished for some good chance to run away. 
SPOKEN— I 
knew the boy loved the girl, and the old man 
didn't love the girl worth a 
cent. 
The old man was a 
kind 
of sporting man, and so I 
says, Brown, old boy, I 
want to lay 
you a 
wager. 
What is it ? says Brown. I 
want to bet you 
five dollars you can't swing your arm with the pendulum of 
that clock five minutes. Done ! says be, I 
take the bet. What 
have I 
got to do ? 
All you have got to do is to follow me and 
go like this— 
CHORUS. 
Here she goes and there she goes, 
Bib- a-de-bob, bib-a-de"-bob, 
Here she goes and there she goes, 
And that is the way to do it, 
Old Brown he set to work at once and soon began to puff, 
I 
cried old Brown, I 
think you'll soon say you've had enough; 
I 
never laid a 
bet, said he, but what I 
mean to win, 
I 
bet another ten, said he, that I 
will not give in.

HERE SHE GOES AND THERE SHE GOES. 
Continued. 
Old Brown was fat, the weather warm, and never once he 
stopped, 
And there upon his heated face there stood the shining drops. 
SPOKEN—And I 
stood in the corner laughing; and old 
Brown still kept up the same old game— 
Here she goes, &c. 
Mrs. Brown who heard me laugh, came into the room to see; 
Oh! goodness gracious, Brown, said she, what can the mat-
ter be ? 
Why, Brown, you must be going mad, of that there is no doubt, 
To stand in front of that old clock and swing your arms about; 
I'll go and fetch the doctor, Brown, if you go on this way, 
But all they could get out of Brown, and this is what he'd 
say— 
Here she goes, & c. 
Old Brown he won the wager, but lost his daughter by the 
game, 
She married Tom in town that day, and back for forgiveness 
came; 
'Twas useless when the job was done for Brown to then 
say nay, 
So he took the joke, my friends, in quite a 
jolly way ; 
He gave a 
party to his friends and oftimes tells with glee, 
While sounds of laughter echo from the jolly company. 
SPOKEN—Yes, says the old man, I 
shall never forget the 
time I 
went— 
Here she goes, &c.

A 
BOOZER AND A 
LOSER. 
Parody on Mary Ann. 
Written by PAVI, IntsssEn, and sung by him with great success. 
o. 
A new expression that caught me, 
I 
heard it first last night, 
While walking through the busy streets, 
Gazing at the sights; 
A friend of mine came passing bye, 
His face with smiles was beaming, 
But I 
saw the twinkle in his eye, 
When he says to me good evening. 
C1101117S: 
Then when this girl would talk to me, 
I 
really felt so clever, 
I 
do not think that two lamp-posts, 
Our plighted love, could sever; 
Have you seen Olivette? not yet, my pet, 
No, no, never; 
Are you going to the ball this evening, baby? 
Well, hardly ever. 
I 
know not what it really meant, 
They were shouting in my ear; 
But everywhere I'd wander, 
This expression I 
would hear; 
But I 
got on when a 
fellow said, 
Are you going to the ball this evening? 
For I 
fell down two flights of stairs, 
For saying not this evening. 
A BOOZER AND A LOSER—CONTINUED. 
The babies on our block got drunk, 
With a 
lot of other coons; 
My sister, she went on a 
tear, 
With the order of full moons; 
When Christmas comes, the babies will 
Be hanging up their socks; 
Mother-in-law will go on a 
tear, 
With old grandfather's clock. 
CHORUS: 
Then it's boozer here, boozer there, 
Everywhere it's boozer; 
If you get in among that gang, 
They'll play you till you're a 
loser; 
They'll work you up in elegant style, 
I 
tell you it is true, sir; 
You will find out what it is to be, 
A boozer and a 
loser.

iVritten by Mrs. CHAS. A. 
GARDNER expressly for JAS. KEARNEY, as 
sung by him With CLINTON HALL'S STRATEGISTS. 
Of all of the darlings that ever I've seen, 
There's none in this world like my sweet little colleen; 
Her eyes are as bright as the stars in the sky, 
And my heart it keeps thumping whenever she's nigh. 
If there was an island away out in the sea, 
And only room on it for Biddy and me, 
We'd live there alone from December till June, 
With only meself and sweet Biddy Muldoon. 
CHORUS: 
Biddy, Biddy, Biddy Muldoon, 
Open your window and look at the moon; 
I'll knock any man in the middle of June, 
That dares to make love to you, Biddy Muldoon. 
We're soon going back to ould Ireland so green, 
Then she'll be all mine, my own sweet little colleen; 
Her smile is as sweet as the violets in May, 
And the sunshine is cold when my Biddy's away; 
The daylight has gone and the stars are beyant, 
To stay here much longer I'm sure that I 
can't; 
She said she'd be here, by the light of the moon, 
navoureen, acushla, sweet Biddy Muldoon. (Chorug).

I 
am the monarch of Limburger cheese, 
When I 
eat, it's go as you please; 
I 
wear piccadilly's and tight- legged pants, 
And so does my sisters, cousins and my aunts. 
Now I 
think that it's awfully mean, 
To treat a 
girl to ice cream, 
When you've only got a 
half-a-dollar in your pants, 
And she invites all her sisters, her cousins and her aunts.

Ienry Ward Beecher is a

But he'll kiss a

And he'll never tell his sisters, cousins or his aunts. 
I

pedestrian by trade, 
Seven hundred and fifty miles I've made, 
I'll make another lap if they'll give me the chance, 
For to sit on my sisters, cousins and as.;.ats,

Biddy the Ballet Girl. 
Composed by JAS. BRADLEY, and sung with great success by CIIAS. 
REDMOND and GEORGIE BLAKE, at Miner's New York Theatre. 
We are a 
gay laboring pair, 
And we have a 
beautiful daughter 
Who never did care much for work, 
'Twas her mother's own wish that she ought to 
We thought that she fancied the stage, 
So we greeted her final request, 
And now she's a 
gay ballet dancer, 
And ranks along with the best. 
CHORUS. 
On the stage she is Madame La Shortie, 
But her right name is Biddy McCarthy, 
She comes home at night and from matinees 
With large baskets of flowers and little bouquets— 
Oh she is our only daughter, 
And her father's the man that taught her. 
She wears spangled clothes, goes round on her toes, 
The pride of the ballet is Biddy. 
Last Saturday night I 
got paid, 
So I 
thought I'd go to the theatre, 
So I 
took the old lady along, 
And in the parquet I 
did seat her. 
When Biddy came out for to dance 
Our son Danny was up the tier, 
And he cried out " Go in, sister Biddy," 
And they bounced him right out on his ear. 
On the stage she is, &c.

BIG FOOT MARY ANN. 
Written by Wm. W ELSH expressly for BARNEY FERGUSON, and 
sung only by him with great success. 
I'm in love with a 
pretty girl, 
She's a 
darling to me sure; 
For style I'll bet she can't be beat, 
Sweet Mary Ann McClure. 
Oh, that's the cognomen of her, 
The one I 
love so dear; 
And as we walk along the street, 
The boys yell out: " she's queer." 
CEIORIIS: 
She has a 
turn-up nose, 
And on it is a 
dimple; 
Hump-backed, cross-eyed, with warts upon her hands. 
Bow-legged as she goes, 
Lob-sided, and she's simple, 
Oh, isn't she a 
handsome girl, my Big-foot Mary Ann. 
I 
took her up to see the show 
Last Wednesday afternoon; 
A 
young man for to sweep the stage 
Stepped out there with a 
broom; 
A 
little boy cried out, " You supeI" 
" 
Oh, Mike, is it soup?" says she; 
"I'm dead with hunger, now look out, 
And order enough for three." (Chorus). 
I 
took her up the other night, 
To get some oyster stew; 
I 
asked her if she'd have some raw, 
When she ordered twenty-two dozen. 
Three dozen more upon half shell, 
I 
heard her loudly bawl, 
And before we left sure divil the bit 
But she eat up shells and all. ( Chorus).

My grandmother she at the age of eighty-three, 
One day in May was taken ill and died, 
And after she was dead, the will of course was read, 
By a 
lawyer as we all stood by his side, 
To my brother, it was found, Ate had left a 
hundred pound's 
The same unto my sister I 
do declare, 
hut when it came to me, the lawyer said I 
see, 
She has left to you her " Old arm- chair." 
CHORUS. 
And how they titter'd, how they chaff'd, 
How my brother and sister laugh'd, 
When they heard the lawyer declare 
Granny had only left to me her old arm chair. 
I 
thought it hardly fair, still I 
said I 
did not care, 
And in the ev'ning took the chair away, 
The neighbors they me chaff'd, my brother at me laugh'd 
And said it would be useful John, some day. 
When you settle down in life find some girl to be your wife, 
You'll find it very handy, I 
declare. 
On a 
cold and frosty night when the fire is burning bright, 
You cal, then sit in your old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
What my brother said came true for in a 
year or two, 
Strange to say I 
settled down in married life, 
I 
first the girl did court, and then the ring I 
bought, 
Took her to church and when she was my wife, 
The old girl and me, were as happy as could be, 
For when my work was over I 
declare, 
I 
ne'er abroad would roam but each night would stay at home, 
And be seated in my old arm chair. 
And how they titter'd, & c. 
One night the chair fell down, when I 
pick'd it up I 
found, 
The seat had fallen out upon the floor. 
And there to my surprise, I 
saw before my eyes, 
A 
lot of notes, two thousand pounds or more, 
When my brother heard of this, the fellow I 
confess, 
Went nearly mad with rage and tore his hair, 
But I 
only laugh'd at him, and said unto him, Jem, 
Don't you wish you had the old arm chair? 
And how they titter'd, 
GAUGER PILL- GARLIC. 
(Parody on Major Gilfeather.) 
Written by EDWIN TALBOT for, and sung by Andy Collorn, the onti 
Banjo March Player in the world. 
Oh! freckled face Gauger Pill-garlic, 
The bummers and loafers all Cry; 
They say use your head for a 
bucket, 
And smother yourself in mince pie; 
They say you're the worst in creation, 
A 
free lunch you'd tackle without fear; 
A 
station house is a 
great recreation, 
And this is the slang you will hear. 
CHORUS: 
A 
sixer for the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
For working a 
servant girl's pocket; 
He thought he'd go off on a 
racket, 
And drink with the money quite free. 
A 
copper nabbed him by the collar 
And said " give that girl every dollar; 
In Sing Sing I'll give you a 
parlor, 
And you can't crack a 
crib any more.' 
The tramp and the political bummer 
Has a 
nose that from rum brightly shines; 
And never does hard work ever bother them, 
And they're always complaining of the times. 
With a 
tomato can and a 
stick in their pocket, 
On the watch for new kegs of stale beer; 
Oh! a 
bar-room with a 
fire in the Winter 
gives a 
gauger a 
jolly old steer, 
CHORUS: 
Then where is the Gauger Pill-garlic, 
his face it would give you the colic; 
I 
think he's gone off on a 
frolic 
With a 
man by the name of Rooney. 
He's drinking champagne in the poor house, 
And feeding on feather weight hash; 
They say he's gone off with Brother Talmage, 
And with Beecher and Elizabeth to mash. 
Oh! jailers and coppers all know him, 
A 
staff once he was on the press; 
Ten cents for a 
ball he does owe me, 
And be gives me a 
puff of his breath. 
He says he is tired of mashing, 
The girl that he had acted queer, 
He searched for her all over Blackwell's Island. 
And he found her with a 
ball and chain on her ear, 
CHORUS: 
Then cheer up old Gauger Pill-garlic, 
Brace up and get full of stale beer, 
Join a 
circus, hire out as a 
toothpick, 
And sit on the sharp edge of a 
spear. 
Dennis Kearney is looking for labor, 
Parnell he's the ladies' fond dear; 
Old Ireland we'll never forget you. 
The country that we love most dear.

ABSENT-MINDED. 
Written by DAN COLLYER, and sung by him with great success at 
Tony Pastor's Opera House. 
Dedicated to SAM DEVERE. 
"Ever thine own Sam." 
I'm very absentminded, of course it's want of thought, 
But somehow I 
can always do things wrong; 
I 
make such sad mistakes, that my heart it nearly breaks, 
And don't think that I 
shall live so very long; 
A 
girl the other day fell o'er a 
heap of clay, 
And to render some assistance I 
did stop; 
But I 
left the girl for dead, and picked up some clay instead 
And with care I 
took it to a 
doctor's shop. 
Chorus—Do pity me, my sorrows you can see, 
To do the thing that's right I 
feel inclined; 
But I'm very often fixed that I 
get my senses mixed 
Because I've such a 
very absent mind. 
A 
lady in a 
train, placed a 
baby on my knees. 
it flurried me a 
bit beyond a 
doubt; 
The smoke from my cigar made the little baby sneeze, 
So through the window meant to throw it out; 
I 
was trying to be so kind, but still my absent mind, 
It very nearly drove me off my head; 
I 
thought 'twas my cigar, but a 
scream from baby's ma, 
Showed me that I 
had slung the baby out instead. 
I'm quite as bad at home, once it was my wife's desire, 
That I 
would take the kettle from the hob; 
Fill it full of water, and place it on the fire, 
But of course I 
made a 
muddle of the job: 
When I 
brought the kettle back, altho' with soot 'twas black 
I 
placed it on the chair where I 
reposed; 
Still my absence did aspire, I 
placed myself upon the fire 
And I 
toasted something else beside my clothes. 
I've a 
dog, a 
very large one, which many people dread, 
We'd both been out, 'twas raining very hard; 
I 
was so absentminded, I 
placed the dog in bed, 
And myself I 
went and chained up in the yard; 
Things appeared all right, I 
lay there all the night. 
It rained, besides the night was very dark; 
I 
lay just like a 
dog, I 
thought I 
was a 
dog, 
Lnd I 
never knew until I 
tried to bark.

0 :-
Sure I'm a 
high-toned 'ristocrat, 
As you can plainly see; 
I'm known by everybody, 
No matter where I 
may be. 
My influence is wonderful, 
Whenever I 
take the stand; 
And if you want a 
thoroughbred, 
Why Maloney is the man. 
C/10R118: 
For Maloney's a 
man, let ye understand, 
Who is well educated and tony; 
His influence is great, sure he takes the cake, 
There's no such a 
man as Maloney. 
You can see that I'm no fighter, 
And always take things cool; 
But if the boys make fun of me, 
They'll find that I'm no fool. 
I'm up and up with every one, 
There's no better in the land; 
So if you want an honest friend, 
Why Maloney is the man.

W EHMAN. 50 Chatham Street. 
Slang phrases come up every day, 
And we hear them on the street, 
But the latest one that I 
have heard, 
To you I 
will repeat; 
On Fifth Avenue Vother day, 
Some young bloods did begin, 
Saying, " Pipe the gal in the blue silk dress, 
And watch me take it in." 
• 
Citonus: 
Take it in! take it in! 
You bet I'll take it in.. 
In churches, gin mills, thro' the town, 
Oh! everywhere we go, 
Among the sports that are known as fast, 
And the straight-laced known as slow; 
Oh! everyone and everywhere 
They each think it no sin 
To scoop up the thing that they like best, 
And straightway take it in. (Chorus). 
TAKE IT IN. —
C'4 )N 
UED. 
Now the people in this world you meet 
Are various and strange; 
There's some that are free as mountain air, 
Whilst others do arrange 
To draw their purse strings tight, # 
And swear they've got no tin, 
Like the jolly old cuss that keeps this house, 
Who always takes it in. ( Chorus). 
Then there are ladies with faces long, 
Would have you think them good— 
How all temptation in this life 
They always have withstood; 
But if you saw their inner self, 
Tho' they look so meek and prim, 
Just give them a 
chance with a 
nice young man, 
how quickly they'll take it in. ( Chorus). 
Now before I 
conclude my song, 
There's one thing I 
would name, 
And I 
mention it right publicly, 
Without any fear or shame; 
If any of you boys ask me now 
To a 
seltzer, beer or gin, 
You can bet your own dear, sweetest life, 
This darling takes it ix. ( Chorus). 
42 
Farewell. 
'The last tie is severed that bound me to this, 
The struggle is over, and now I 
am free; 
I 
have loved thee so fondly no language could tilt. 
So proudly and coldly I 
bid thee " Farewell." 
The conflict is over, I've conquered at last, 
No longer in sadness I 
muse on the past; 
To my joy I 
have conquered, the conflict is o'er, 
So proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
You may go and be happy—ne'er think of the past, 
You have slighted a 
love that could love to the last; 
You may now pass me by with that cold smile of yore, 
But proudly I 
tell thee I 
love thee " no more." 
I 
bid thee forget me, wherever thou art, 
Though thoughts of my first love may cling to my heart. 
When friends shall prove false, and fortune decline, 
Thou wilt sigh for the love that no longer is thine. 
W HEN you see a 
young couple late at night on the lake 
bank, chewing, biting, and eating each other, just let 'era 
alone. 
They are only fooling, 
A 
HUSBAND got angry with his wife and locked her up. 
At dinner time, to mortify her, he sent her a 
bone by his son. 
The little fellow knocked at the door, saying; " Mother, 
father says here is a 
bone for you to pick." " Tell him he's 
not your father, and there's a 
bone for him to pick."

FACES WE'LL NEVER FORGET. 
As sung by FRANK LEWIS at Hyde 8r. Behman's Theatre, Brooklyn, 
I 
have sung of the topics and the events of the day, 
But now for the present I've something new to say; 
I 
will speak of the men you have heard of and seen, 
Whose name in our memory will ever be green; 
The first is a 
friend in the hour of need, 
Who will stretch forth his hand is a 
true friend indeed; 
When your pockets are empty, he'll stick to you yet. 
He's oae of the faces we'll never forget. 
I 
will speak first of one in our hearts ever dear, 
And I'm sure our whole nation still wish he was here; 
A 
Martyr, a 
President, and worthy of mind, 
The exponent of right and virtue combined; 
He was murdered in Washington some years ago, 
And how deeply our country has felt the blow; 
Though gone from us now, though gone, we find yet 
Old honest Abe Lincoln we'll never forget. 
New York in its day has produced some good men, 
Who are known from this city unto the world's end; 
There's William Cullen Bryant who handled the pen, 
That has silenced the wrath of this world's greatest men; 
There's poor Tweed who died in Ludlow Street Jail, 
Whose life was a 
warning, a 
history, a 
tale; 
There's Fisk who was shot down whose loss we regret, 
These are some of the faces we'll never forget. 
The stage it has likewise produced some good names, 
Who have struggled how hard for honor and fame; 
There's Cushman, Davenport, Forrest as well, 
Sothern and others too numerous to tell; 
There's one who'll remain in our hearts even more, 
Though she's gone from our midst unto Heaven's bright 
shore; 
As dear a 
little maiden the stage has had yet, 
Ella Mayo's sweet face we should nerer forget.

A Quiet Little Home. 
Originally sung at Harrigan & Hart's Theatre Comique, Broadway. 
by EDWIN BARRY. 
I 
lead a 
very homely life in a 
quiet sort of way, 
I 
like well to enjoy, and not feel over gay; 
Fast life does not agree with me at any time or place, 
I've traveled nearly through this world at quite a 
quiet pace. 
CHORUS. 
A 
quiet little home in a 
quiet little way, 
A 
quiet little wife sitting quiet all the day, 
A 
quiet little parlor, a 
quiet cup of tea, 
A 
life of peace and quietness, that's the life for me. 
I 
like to have my social sing, I 
like my pipe and glass, 
love my wife. I 
love my friends with whom the time to pass 
A reasonable hour to rest, an early hour to rise, 
"I will make a 
man both healthy, wealthy, prosperous and wise. 
A 
quiet little home, &c. 
So now, my friends, take my advice, and do the best you cal. 
To earn a 
name that will become an honest working man ; 
Study the comforts of your home, and very soon you'll find 
A life of peace and quietness is best suited to the mind.

quiet little home, &c.

A 
BUNION THAT I 
FOUND IN 
FATHER'S 
SHOE. 
Parody on Flower from Mother's Grave. 
Written and sung by Part, DRESSER. 
I've had a 
toothpick at home that I've had for ninety days, 
The one who gave it does a 
song and dance; 
lie wears a 
high silk hat, and carries an actor's ten-cent 
cane, 
You can tell him by the fringe that's JIl his pants, yes, 
at a 
glance; 
But there's one sweet, little relic that I 
can never forget, 
And the giver has long since slid up the flue; 
Oh, it is not a 
faded flower, nor a 
brandy smash and sour, 
It's a 
bunion that I 
found in father's shoe; yes, it is true. 
CHORUS: 
Treasured in my memory like a 
free lunch route, 
Is this little story. true it's yet; 
But I 
never can forget when he whistled Olivette, 
And the bunion that I 
found in father's shoe, the wind, 
it blew. 
Now I 
thought it would be best to tell you papa went out 
West, 
The little Indians struck him deaf and dumb; 
1,
-.2 was not a 
readjuster, yet he'd go upon a 
buster, 
Get full of sherry cobblers and bad rum just like a 
bum; 
He was formerly a 
sailor, and he sang in Billee Taylor, 
Every word that I 
have spoken friends, is true; 
But he died in Omaha from eating a 
barrel of cold slaw, 
That's where I 
found this little bunion in his shoe; how 
do you do? 
C
HORUS: 
Now my story's almost told, yet a 
tale I 
will unfold, 
Of course, you wish to know what it's about; 
;his is the same old shoe that made Senator Platt feel blue, 
It's the one that kicked old Roscoe Coukling out.

James Gordon Bennett's Carpet Bag. 
Written and sung by America's Favorite Motto and Comic Vocalist, 
CHARLES H. 
D UNCAN. 
I'll sing you a 
ditty that I'm sure you'll say is witty, 
And before I'm done will cause you all to laugh. 
'Tis of a 
man of some renown, and a 
native of this town, 
Connected with an editorial staff. 
Ile went abroad, ' tis said, some damsel fair to wed, 
Whose Christian name, ' tis whispered round, was Mag. 
When be sailed for Liverpool, across the briny pool, 
In his left hand he held a 
carpet bag. 
I 
know ' twill be a 
task, an unpleasant thing to ask 
Your ears, but pray don't let your spirits flag, 
And I'll endeavor to explain, yes, each article will name 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
here was reports of the Brooklyn scandal, and a 
symphony 
wrote by IIandel ; 
Letters from the only girl he ever loved ; 
A 
pair of Harry Miner's dirty socks, wrapped in a 
note from 
" 
Sunset " Cox; 
A 
package of " queer " that some young gounoff shoved ; 
Elizabeth Ti ton's last confession, an article on secession, 
While tied up in Dr. Mary Walker's old suspenders 
Was a document rather suspicious, looking old and quite 
judicious, 
Containing accounts of Senator Conkling's secret benders ; 
Then a 
poem by deacon Smith, without either rhyme or pith; 
A 
new-fangled way to play the game of tag ; 
A 
picture of President Hayes lacing Victoria Woodhull's stays, 
I 
saw within James Gordon Bennett's bag. 
'fhere was the long lost Charlie Ross with Jack Aberle on a 
hoss, 
Making love to Tennie Claflin on the sly; 
Old Ben Butler on a 
stump Potter's committee trying to pump, 
Senator Thurman he was chanting " Root hog or die." 
Owney Geoghan he was caught doing things he hadn't ought, 
Billy Sexton with a 
broken billiard cue. 
l 
le was stirring a 
pot o: soup for a 
girl who had the croup, 
Who rejoices in the name of Duck -foot Sue; 
Muldoon the solid man he had joined a 
Scottish clan, 
Little Mack was holding Bonner's bobtail nag; 
But what caused by brain to whirl was Pastor's Coney Island 
girl, 
Dancing the can-can in James Gordon Bennett's bag,

JANE RILEY'S ALWAYS DRY. 
Composed by EDWIN TALBOT. Sung by BONNIE RUNNELLS. 
Air—John Riley's Always Dry. 
I 
have a 
tine old woman, Jane Riley, don't you see, 
I 
strike her with a 
feather, this Janey she loves me; 
Her throat is like a 
fountain, her honor she won't cry, 
But, you know, hiding all her faults, Jane Riley's 
always dry. 
Cnonus: 
Ginger ale, very stale, 
She would order my Danny to go out and Illy; 
I'm very stout, she would shout, 
I'll keep drinking rock and rye. 
Claret wine, gin so fine, 
She would land down the kettle on the table and cry 
My son Dan, fill the can, 
Her honor, Jane Riley's Dry, 
Its only very lately Jane Riley's nose got red, 
Sure neither paint or whitewash would whiten Janey's 
head. 
It's when I'm only rising, scarce opening my eye. 
I 
catch her sending out the boy, Jane Riley's always 
dry. 
. 
Her mother often told me, when I 
was young and gay, 
The only thing to keep her still, was to let her have 
her way; 
You see I'm nearly looney, just look you in my eye, 
'Tis a 
big drop of the cratur, Jane Riley's always dry.

Music published by F W. HELMICK, No. 
50 Fourth Street, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
No doubt you will wcnder why I 
dress so gay, 
Always in fashion this swell of the day 
My clothes they are cut in the latest of style, 
And the darling young ladies on me fondly smile. 
My way is so winning, full of exquisite grace, 
Why they really do laugh when we meet face to face. 
The gents they all look with derision at me, 
Because I 
am always dressed up to a 
T. 
CHORUS. 
While pivoting, waltzing in the grand dance so gay, 
At sweet Saratoga or Far Rockaway. 
Oh! the darling young ladies say I 
am a 
dear, 
Why none's half so charming as Clarence Lavere. 
On a 
nice afternoon if the weather is fair, 
To my barber's I 
go to curl up my hair, 
Brush off my clothes fix myself all serene, 
For I 
always endeavor to look bright and clean. 
I 
am a 
good hand at billiards and like my good wine, 
A 
card player, well I'm considered quite fine. 
I 
never borrow trouble, always feel well, 
And a 
good joke I'm always quite ready to tell. 
While pivoting, etc, 
At a 
quarter of two 1 
must be on Broadway, 
To meet a 
young lady I 
saw the other day 
Her pa he is rich—so at least I've been told— 
And all I 
desire is to grab at his gold. 
Then to the sea- beach iii summer I'll go, 
Cut such a 
dash, ahi what a 
show. 
There in the ball-room to promenade and dance, 
With any young lady I 
meet there by chance. 
While pivoting, etc.

KENNEDY, at the SAN FRANCISCO MINSTRELS, New N. ork. 
Music, to be had at Mrs. P. 
LIEDER'S Music House, 60 Chatham Street, 
who holds the Copyright. 
Can you so soon forget me, 
You loved me once so well; 
You loved me in the Summertime, 
The Wintertime as well; 
You said you would never leave me, 
My love you would never forget; 
And often in our tales of love, 
I 
called you my dearest pet. 
CHORUS: 
In the evening when 'twas twilight, 
You've often sat beside me; 
Whispering love, my turtle dove, 
Can you so soon forget me; 
I'm fading like the flowers, 
That blushed and bloomed in Sumter' 
Dear is the vision that merrily recalls, 
Can you forget me so soon? 
Then my heart shall feel no trouble, 
My head shall feel no pain; 
Only to see thee, darling, 
And hear thy voice again. 
Just to press thy ruby lips, 
Your sunny face I 
see; 
Don't forget me, darling, 
Can you so soon forget me?

Of all the young swells that you ever seen, 
There's none for to equal us two La Da Das; 
We have just come over from the land of the green, 
Where we left the gang and our Ma Mas. 
We are noted for being two bashful young men, 
Especially where ladies are found; 
If you go into any of the fashionable balls, 
You will hear the word go around. • 
CHORUS: 
Oh, myl ain't they two babies, 
Look at the swells with the glass on their eye; 
Oh, yes, they're the pets of the ladies, 
Clarence and Arthur, now don't they look fly. 
Now Clarence and Arthur, as everyone knows, 
Drinks wine from the keg as fast as it flows ; 
Although we are not lushers that have a 
red nose; 
We go for the bowl as far as it goes. 
We don't care for money although we have none, 
Our parents are very well off; 
We get through on our face, if not on our shape, 
We are Clarence and Arthur the toffs. (Chorus).

Oh, we kept the ball a 
rolling, boys, 
Till the hour of twelve drew nigh, 
Casey took some whiskey, swallow'd glass and all, 
With the laughing I 
nearly died. 
Then we all flew for the kitchen, 
Put the turkey out of sight, 
Little Widow Dunn, by the crowd was sung, 
And they kept it up all night.

You may think that I 
am mad, but I 
only do feel sad, 
And the reason I 
will tell you every one; 
I 
courted a 
nice young girl, and her name was Peggy Doyle, 
And I 
took her to Coney Isle to have some fun. 
She is from the County Down, and she weighs 200 lbs., 
And I 
thought she would be true to me all the while ; 
But if I 
had it to do again, she would never go to 
Swim along with me again to Coney Isle. 
CHORUS 
She had salt water there galore, 
And she swallowed a 
quart or more, 
And the gang upon the beach began to smile, 
Sure they all did wave theii hats, 
And shouted float her Par
t, 
The day I 
took my Peg to Coney Isle. 
Now its when we reabed the pier, we went and had some 
beer, 
And after that we went to have a 
bathe. 
You may talk about the fat woman that travels with Bar-
num's show, 
But you'd ought to see my Peg upon the waves. 
The gang began to guy us, my bosom was on fire, 
And some ot them gave me a 
grand hurrah ! 
When a 
lad with a 
crooked mouth - 
Be heavens shouted out, there's one of the lions 
That escaped the other day. Chorus. 
Now of course I 
did feel mad after listening to that lad. 
A 
rid I 
know he thought himself quite smart, 
But if I 
had him in New York, up near tne Central Park, 
You can bet that I 
would break his heart. 
I 
don't say I'm a 
fighter, a 
cutter or a, biter, 
But I 
always take my own part all the while; 
Arndt musha! bad luck to Peg, 
May she lose one ot htt legs, 
Before I 
take her again to Coney Island.

The Day I 
Bought the Fish. 
Written and sung by DAVE HOWARD in " The Rival Clothes Dealers." 
I 
walked around the street one day 
To buy some fish without any pay; 
You get them very fine, they say, 
But I 
don't care for that. 
The first thing that attracted me 
Was the name of Isaac Boronofsky, 
To say the name it puzzled me 
The day I 
bought the fish. 
I 
asked him the kind of fish he had, 
Pike, pickerel, suckers, smelts or shad. 
You say that again you make me mad— 
'Twas then I 
got afraid. 
'Twas then he struck me with a 
stiff, 
And called me a 
regular Hebrew thief; 
On my left eye I 
put some beef 
The day I 
bought the fish. 
He threw some water on me quick, 
And tried to make me then to speak, 
And he put some ice around my feet— 
He thought he killed me sure. 
When all at once I 
made a 
leap, 
And struck Boronofsky in the teeth; 
His wife hollered out " Police! police r 
The day I 
bought the fish. 
I 
run so quick I 
couldn't stop, 
When all at once I 
made a 
flop; 
Into Croton water I 
took a 
drop, 
I 
thought he had me sure. 
When all at once he made a 
jump, 
To snatch a 
Croton water pump, 
And he struck me right square on the konk 
The day I 
bought the fish.

There Never was a 
Coward Where the Shamrock 
Grows. 
Respectfully dedicated to Fayette Welsh, and sung with great 
success by Edwin Talbot in his Parlor entertainments. 
Let cowardly slanderers say what they may, 
Against the dear land of my birth; 
But I 
will maintain in spite of all foes, 
It's the dearest green spot on this earth. 
Some say we are cowards and fit for naught else 
But drinking our home-made potheen 
But I'll throw back the villainous lie in their face, 
We're as brave as the shamrock is green. 
CHORUS. 
Pat may be foolish and very often wrong, 
Pat 
got a 
temper which don't last very long, 
Pat is full of jollity as everybody knows. 
But there never was a 
coward where the shamrock growk 
Tho' oppress'd and insulted for hundreds of years 
By.the foe who once conquered them, they 
Have left us the courage our forefather's had— 
For that they cannot take away. 
They kept learning from us, stole all we hold dear, 
And crushed us till others cried shame; 
But in spite of it all we have struggled to learn 
That courage and wit are the same, 
ONLY A 
FACE AT THE WINDOW. 
ks sung by W. H HAMILTON, the Premier Baritone, at the SAN FRAN 
CISCO MINSTRELS 
Only a 
face at the window, 
Only a 
face, nothing more; 
Yet the look in the eyes as they meet mine, 
Still comes to me o'er and o'er. 
Only a 
word of greeting, 
Only a 
word, that was all; 
Yet all day in my heart it echo'd 
Like the sound of an angel's call. 
Only a 
smile of welcome, 
Only a 
smile as I 
passed, 
Yet that smile will still be remembered 
As long as my life shall last 
Only a 
woman, you tell me, 
Only a 
woman to thee, 
Yet there's naught that this wide world contain-
Half so dear as this woman to me.

I'm Waltzingham McSweeney, 
A man well known to fame, 
I'm a 
shining light at all the clubs, 
I'm a 
man of pluck and game. 
I'm the best known man on Broadway, 
On account of my form and face, 
And the stylish way I 
carry myself, 
With a 
walk of air and grace, 
I'm the one you can't help notice, 
I'm a 
man of splendid parts, 
I've a 
high-born education, 
I'm decomplished in all the arts 
I 
can swim like Captain Boynton, 
I 
can walk a 
Highland fling, 
I 
can pull a 
boat with Hanlon, 
I'm a 
crack shot on the wing.

CHORUS. 
Waltzingham McSweeney, 
That's the cognomen I 
bear, 
The ladies admire my pretty shape 
And aristocratic air, 
The swells they all get jealous, 
When the dashing girls at me lear, 
For my graceful glide in the ball-room, 
I'm called the gay cavalier. 
I'm a 
great pedestrian walker, 
My record dates far back, 
I'd be sure to beat O'Leary, 
If they'd let me on the track, 
I'm known at all the races, 
My bets are all the boast, 
I 
can always name the winning horse, 
Before he leaves the post, 
All politicians seem to know me, 
They shake my hand with pride, 
For they know my great influence 
In elections turn the tide. 
All the Congressmen and Senators, 
Admire me everywhere, 
And Waltzingham McSweeney, 
Some say will be your Mayor.

Prict-
10 cents. 
Ohl we've parted from each other, 
And our dream of love is o'er, 
That bright dream was too beautiful to last 
And we'll meet as only strangers, 
In the future evermore, 
Our once tender love is buried in tyleo past. 
Tho' I've tried to bear the blow, 
Without sighs or bitter tears, 
And tried to smile when my heart ached with pain. 
Yet the burning tears would Pall, 
In spite of all that I 
could do, 
For the darling one I 
ne'er shall see again, 
CHORUS. 
My dream of love is o'er, 
I 
try to smile when my heart aches with pain; 
But the memory of the past comes up before 
Me like a 
dream, for the darling one I 
ne'er shall sel 
again. 
Ohl they say you love another, 
Who has claimed you for his bride, 
And you wish me to forgive and to forget; 
All the vows we pledged together, 
By the rippling of the tide, 
As I 
looked into your beauteous eyes—my pet. 
Ah! the heart is like the tides, 
That flow and ebb at will, 
I 
would not cease to love thee if I 
could; 
So, thro' all the future years, 
I'll love thee fondly, dearly, darling! 
For I 
could not cease to love thee if I 
would.
