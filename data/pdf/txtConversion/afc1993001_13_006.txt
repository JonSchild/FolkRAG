METHODOLOGY
 
This report incorporates our findings about two ethnic communities in Bir-
mingham, Alabama.
 The Deep South region is generally thought of as primarily
 
rural and almost exclusively populated by Anglo-Americans and Afro-Americans.
 
In fact, there are a number of highly urbanized areas; Birmingham is the "Pitts-
burgh of the South", a center for mining, steelmaking, and metal refining.  And,
 
throughout the small town as well as urban South, sizable and culturally-reten-
tive white ethnic communities can be found.
 In the cases of the two groups we
 
studied--Greeks and Lebanese--the Birmingham communities are the largest in the
 
state, but their relatives, potential marriage partners, and ethnic social net-
works are located in smaller towns and other cities across Alabama, Florida,
 
Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee.  This report will address the two communi-
ties primarily as autonomous social structures.  We will, however, attempt to
 
characterize our observations about the similiarities in the ethnic experience
 
in the Deep South and the parallel responses that this social milieu has evoked
 
in terms of ethnic maintenance strategies.
 
The Greek community studied here is the congregation of Holy Trinity-Holy
 
Cross Greek Orthodox Cathedral in downtown Birmingham.  Although some Greeks
 
attend the local Eastern Rite Catholic churches and other Orthodox churches,
 
Holy Trinity-Holy Cross is the obvious cultural and reliqious center for the
 
area's Greeks and Greek Americans.
 
The fieldworkers selected St. Elias Maronite Catholic Church as the site
 
for the study of ethnic heritage and language education in the Lebanese com-
munity.
 St. Elias is one of two Eastern Rite Catholic churches in the city to
 
which Lebanese belong.  The other is St. George Melkite Greek Catholic Chur Th.
 
Both were founded by immigrant Lebanese.
 The congrecation at St. George w

not included in this study due in part to time restrictions, but also to the
 
highly mixed ethnic composition of its membership--Lebanese, Greek, Palestin-
ian, and Syrian, led currently by an ethnically Greek priest.
 While Lebanese
 
from both churches are active in local Lebanese cultural life, efforts toward
 
institutionalization of ethnic education have been centered at predominantly-

Initi al contacts in the Lreek cominuna ty were securec  from Fr.  fmanuei
 
Vasilakis, priest at Holy Trinity-Holy Cross, and at St. Elias through t
:
 
parish priest, Fr. Richard Saad.
 Each offered his own observations on t
 
ethnic education efforts in his parish, and further
 offered us free use
 
the church library and further contacts among parishioners who have been
 
directly involved in or are supportive of language and ethnic education.
 
Vasilakis  arranged many of the interviews for us personally; Fr. Saad gave
 
a list of contacts and made known his approval of our work.
 (
See Appendix B-
1 for lists of informants.)
 
The fieldworkers also met with Karen Roleri, interviewer for the Greek and
 
Lebanese communities on the NEH-funded "BirmingFind" local history project.
 
Although Ms. Rolen had not explored education in her study of the city's Greeks
 
and Lebanese, she did provide  a supplementary list of older ethnic-community
 
activists and some insights into the composition of the communities.
 (
The
 
"BirmingFind" reports are attached in Appendix F.)
 
All interviews more extensive than casual, drop-in conversation were tape-
recorded and have been indexed and their more important or pertinent sections
 
transcribed.
 (
See Appendix C.)
 The fieldworkers also took auxiliary notes
 
during the interviews, especially when visual materials were presented by the
 
informants.

Further information on the informants can be found in Appendix B.
 
Interviews with the Lebanese informants were arranged by us and took
 
place in their homes, with the exception of James Mezrano, who was interview
 
at his place of business, an interior decorating shop in Mountain Br(
 
bama.  The following sketches briefly describe the informants; more
 
tion is given in Appendix B.
 
Fr. Richard Saad, pastor of St. Elias since 1972; this is his first par-
ish.
 He is Lebanese-American, son of an immigrant father and a sec-
ond-generation American mother.
 He grew up in the large Detroit
 
Lebanese community, but does not speak Arabic fluently.
 He does,
 
however, understand a considerable amount, and speaks well enough to
 
communicate at--in his words--a "superficial" level with Arabic-
speaking parishioners.
 He is the first American-born or American-
trained priest at St. Elias.
 He does not favor opening a parochial
 
all-day school at St. Elias.
 
Josephine Wehby Sharbel, daughter of the founder and first teacher of the
 
St. Elias Arabic School.
 She is 78, the daughter of immigrants, and
 
has spent most of her life in Birmingham.
 Her father was a peddlar;
 
her mother ran a fine  lace and linens shop.  Widow of a member of
 
a leading Birmingham Lebanese family, her children all live in Bir-
mingham and attend St. Elias.
 She is a fluent speaker of Arabic.
 
Elizabeth Boohaker, former secretary at St. Elias under Fr. Abi-Chedid
 
and member of one of the founding families of the Birmingham com-
munity.
 She was born in Birmingham in 1913, but lived two years
 
(
1925-27)  in Lebanon, when her father attempted to return permanently
 
to farming in his native village.
 Her father died en route to
 
Lebanon in 1937 and she took her mother to his grave after World War
 
II.
 She has made several visits to Lebanon.
 She is unmarried and

 We especially researched the history
 
of immigrant communities in the Southeast region.
 These materials are listed
 
in the bibliographies, Appendix A.
 
The "Key Contributor Forms" provided by the project were mailed as a fol-
low-up to the interview, accompanied by :a thank-you letter and a "Questionnaire
 
on Ethnic Maintenance" devised by the fieldworkers.
 The questionnaire wa s
 
designed to reflect the information we received in our early interviews a
nd
 
survey the informants ' ability to isolate and report components of languag
 
and culture which their communities might choose to retain, and to ascerta.
 
the differing values they might place on these various factors in a series of
 
different cultural settings.
 A sample of the questionnaire is included in
 
Appendix C.
 
In the course of our work with these Greeks and Lebanese we observed that
 
they do not clearly differentiate formal from informal education.
 Rather, edu-
cation in the home is seen as requiring education in the church as a necessary
 
supplement, especially for the Americanized and non-Greek- or non-Arabic-speak-
ing, but highly ethnically conscious, parents.
 Parents, elders, the parish
 
priest, Sunday school teachers, and Greek/Arabic school teachers are all
 
jointly responsible for cultural education of the younger Greek and Lebanese
 
Americans.  Further, they do not draw a distinction between language mainte-
nance, religious maintenance, and cultural maintenance.  Most do not wish to
 
rank one above the others.
 Our interviewees' responses to questions about
 
education might be answered with the need for Greek or Arabic classes,  for
 
catechism training (
especially by the Maronites), or ethnic dance,  food, or
 
song celebrations.
 
Thus this report encompasses not only formal but informal education, and
 
the teaching  of not just language, but religious tradition and cultural hen -

tage.
 It attempts to characterize the continuum of cultural retention activi
-
ties carried out in the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross and St. Elias schools, in the
 
Greek and Lebanese homes, and in the various activities of church and commu-
nity social organizations.
 
Our findings are organized under three main headings.
 "Historical Back-
ground" outlines, first, the histories of the parishes and, second, the his-
tories of the language schools, describing the format, content, and pedagogy
 
they have evolved since their founding.  The  four  sections under "Ethnic
 
Maintenance" evaluate these communities' ethnic maintenance struggles and docu-
ment and analyze our informants'  attitudes concerning language and heritage
 
education.  This section is based directly on our interviews and cites exten-
sively from the tape transcripts and our fieldnotes.
 The final "Recommenda-
tions" essay critiques the project and our own work and poses further questions
 
for research on these and other ethnic educational institutions and ethnic com-
munities.
 
This research was carried out by both fieldworkers in complete collabora-
tion.
 Likewise this report is jointly authored.
 However, Conklin, a socio-
linguist, has been primarily responsible for the literature review and analysis
 
of the community reponses concerning language maintenance and McCallum, a folk-
lorist, for the literature and responses concerning cultural maintenance.

Local legend has it that three seafaring brothers were the first Greek
 
immigrants to Alabama:
 the first to Mobile in 1873, the second to Montgomery
 
in 1878, and the third--George Cassimus--to Birmingham in 1884.
 Cassimus is
 
described as a British merchant seaman who, with his two brothers, had hired
 
out on a Confederate gunrunner and came from the Gulf port of Mobile to Bir-
mingham,  first working for the fire department, and later opening up a lunch
 
stand (Petrou 1979:  2
1.
 Despite the controversial legends surrounding the ori-
gins of Alabama's first Greek settlers, most immigrants who left the patrida
  
entered the U.S.  through Castle Garden on Ellis Island (the Kastengardi that
 
is often the setting for immigration narratives), and settled in the U.S.  under
 
less dramatic circumstances  (Christu 1977:  1-2).
 
Greek migration to the U.S. has always followed political developments
 
in the Mediterranean area, particularly during 1880 tc 1920,  the era of (
Ireat-
est migration: the continued tensions between Greece and Turkov,  the Dalkan
 
wars (
1912-1913),  and the flight of Greeks from army conscription or persecu-
tion in Asia Minor (Thernstrom 1980:  431; Sa
.loutos 1964:  20).
 Turbulent inter-
nai politics and unstable leadership--political schisms developed between ro ,
-.
,-
alists and republicans--also contributed to the exodus at this time.
 Most 0
 
the early Greek immigrants to America, 
however,  left their homeland as a
 
result of the poverty resulting from the severe depression of its agricultural
 
economy, especially on the Peloponnesian peninsula from 1882-86 when the Euro-
pean market for raisins and currants,  Greece's principal exports, collapsed
 
(
Patterson 1976:  7
).
 The majority of the earliest immigrants to the U.S.,
 
-
and even up until after World War II, were unskilled single males, the first
 
wave often planning to return with their savings from America  to their Pelo-
ponnesian villages to establish a farm or business,or t
Dsupport their kin,  or
 
to dower their daughter or sister, both strong Greek traditions.
 Many of the
 
Greek immigrants to Birmingham, however,  as well as those who settled else-
where in the U.S. after 1900, were already married, or later returned to Greece
 
to find a bride,  intending from the outset to establish permanent residency in
 
America (Petrou 1979:  4; Patterson 1976: 8
).
 
Most of the early Greek immigrants to Birmingham came from the Pelopon-
nesian area and the islands of Corfu, Samos, and Rhodes, although some second-
wave immigrants,  like C. W. Jovaras, Georgia Kampakis, and others in this study,
 
came into the city from smaller Greek American enclaves elsewhere in the South
 
(Petrou 1979:  4
).
 Reports on the number of early Greek residents in the city
 
are conflicting,  and official U.S.  government immigration and census statistics
 
are deceptive.
 Growing from the 100 enumerated in the 1900 census, Greeks
 
numbered 900 Birmingham and 1200 Ensley residents by 1913  (Petrou 1979: 19).
 
Census data from 1920, however, reports only 485 Greeks in the city  (Birming-
Find).
 The Greek immiurants
, settled in metropolitan Bi.LminQham,  as well as in
 
numerous of the satellite colTmiunities--Ens ev,  Bessemer, Wvlam,  and Pral:
�t City
 
in particular--oriented toward Jefferson County's coal mines and iron and ste..
 
mills.
 In this early phase of the county's industrial development,  labor
 
in short supply,  and southern blacks as well as southern and eastern Europ(
 
immigrants were sought for the heavy, dirty, manual work.
 By as early as 1909
 
there were 500 Greeks in Ensley, many living in the Sherman Heights area, where
 
"9 out of 100 stores were Greek owned," and the majority of the Greek residents
 
were TCI  (Tennessee Coal,  Iron,  and Railroad Company)  employees  (
Petrou 1979:
 
14). 
Except for this major concentration of Greeks in Ensley, there appears

to have been little "ghetto" living, although Greek families generally lived
 
within the same neighborhoods.  Within Birmingham proper, Greeks settled in the
 
Southside, especially on Cullom Street, and in Norwood.
 
Even before World War I, but especially after 1920, Greeks in Birmingham,
 
as elsewhere, began leaving their jobs as common laborers to go into retail
 
businesses, and a Greek American middle class emerged very early in the city's
 
history (Moskos 1980: 17).
 The majority of the Greeks, in the so-called "entre-
prenurial tradition," soon found work in wholesaling and retailing (Christu
 
1977: 10), and a 1908 survey of Greek American enterprises in Birmingham
 
included 125 food-related enterprises:
 sidewalk fruit stands, confectionaries,
 
groceries, drink bottling companies, coffee importers, restaurants and cafes,
 
wholesale produce companies, bakeries, and meat markets  (
Petrou 1979: 11-13).
 
Many of these enterprises were begun on a very small scale, with a small capi-
tal investment, and almost no overhead--as sidewalk food
, stands ; by the
 
early 1900s, Greeks had such a monopoly as street vendors that a 1902 petition
 
to the city council unsuccessfully tried to revoke their retail licenses
 
(
Petrou 1979: 9
) .
 As a profitable sideline to their numerous restaurants,
 
Greeks in Birmingham apparently also comprised the majority of the city's
 
bootleggers during the Prohibition era, importing "Pensacola rye" from Florida
 
and selling it openly to a large and heterogeneous city-wide clientele (Christu
 
1977:  32-33).
 Other early non-food-related Greek-owned businesses included
 
hotels, barber shops, shoeshine shops, laundries, cleaning shops, and billiard
 
parlors.
 
The final wave of Greek immigrants into Birmingham followed the 1965
 
Immigration and Nationality Act, precipitated also by the increasing conflicts
 
between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus, and result
ing in the exodus of 142,000
 
Greeks to the U.S.  during the late 1960s and early 70s.
 These later immigrants
 
Conk 1
1 n/McCalluin-- 14
 
included both men and women who often had received professional and technical
 
training, and tended to come from Athens or central Greece, with no intention
 
of returning to their home Land (Moskos 1980: 9
) .
 The Birmingham community,
 
however, also includes a sizeable number of recent immigrants who have been
 
educated only through grammar school, and have been described by one informant,
 
Josie Graphos, as "Greeks from the steel center side of town,  [
the] blue-collar
 
side, which is very ethnic .
 .
 .
 what I call the '
imports.'"
 (This and all
 
other citations from Graphos from tape log ES82-Mc/C-C7).
 Christine Grammas
 
describes the traditionalist attitude of some of the post-World War II immi-
grants:
 
Those people come to this country because it's a country of oppor-
tunity as everybody knows, and
 
over here.  Well, you can't do
 
going to live an American, you
 
your traditions are different,
 
be Greek.
 That's impossible.
 
yet, they think they can bring Greece
 
it.
 You live in this country, you
 
leave your Greek ways over there.
 
but you cannot transform everybody to
 
Now that's my beef with these new-
cor
ners that come over (tape log ES82-Mc/C-C14).
 
This intra-community split has been characteristic of the Greek experience in
 
Birmingham since at least the 1920s, developing, in part, along class and
 
residency lines between Ensley (working class, recent immigrants)  and Birming-
ham proper (middle class, second- or third-generation immigrants).

The seventh Greek Orthodox congregation in the U.S., Holy Trinity (Agia
  
Triada) Church was founded in 1902 with the organization of a lay committee
 
(Kinotitos), the Lord Byron Society (named in honor of the British poet who

 Reverend Kallinikos Kanellas, an ethnic Greek
 
from Constantinople, Turkey, was its first priest, and the first mass was

celebrated in 1907.
 After a three-year fund-raising drive, during which
 
time the small parish met in rented halls, the Society purchased a former
 
Methodist-Episcopal Church building on 19th Street and Avenue C, South (now
 
Third Avenue, South), and in 1909 the parish, with 100 members, was officially
 
named--"The Greek Orthodox Community of Holy Trinity, Birmingham, Alabama"--
and received a state charter.
 Shortly after the organization of the church,
 
daily afternoon Greek School classes were begun in the "little run-down build-
ing" next door that was also used as a general meeting place  (Christu 1977:  12).
 
An early Greek American mutual aid society, the Young Greeks Progressive Soci-
ety, was also organized in 1909 or 1910 in Birmingham, and by 1911 its member-
ship included 150 young businessmen.
 Its activities ranged from helping new
 
immigrants acquire citizenship, to athletic training and contests, to English
 
language education (
Burgess 1913:  174-179)
.
 When Kanellas left in 1912, he
 
was replaced by Father Germanos Smirnakis, described as "a most learned man,
 
a good linguist, and the author of several books .
 .
 -
 [who also]  lectured
 
every Sunday evening to his people on various subjects--religious, historical,
 
hygenic, etc."  (
Burgess 1913: 171-174).
 A succession of presumably Greek-
born priests appointed to the Holy Trinity parish by the Archdiocese followed
 
Smirnakis and are enumerated in Appendix F-i.
 
At the eve of the Depression, the Greek American community in B
irmingham
 
numbered over 1500,  "yet with this expansion came inter-community [
sic]  ten-
sion," between what seem to have been factionalized parishioners with differ-
ing values relating to ethnic heritage,  language, and education (
Petrou 1979:
 
29-30)
.
 
Dissent within the community began developing in 1926, over the selection
 
process and hiring of an additional teacher to serve what some community mem-
bers thought was an overload of students for only one Greek School teacher.

,
 
At the base of the argument was a long-standing controversy within the Greek
 
AmerIcan community between ecclesiastical and lay community authority in church
 
affairs.
 Nicholas Christu,
 then secretary of the Holy Trinity Church board,
 
who was active in the dissenting group,  commented:
 
Because we want to get these two schools together,  united, the only
 
way we can unite them is to fire both teachers and bring a new
 
teacher or let the parents to vote which teacher they want.
 [
It is]
 
up to them and not the sinvoulion [

This argument continued through 1932, and after unsuccessful efforts at recon-
ciliation, the Birmingham Greek community finally split over the school issue
 
in 1933, when approximately one-third of the Holy Trinity parishioners,  incluc
 
ing most of the members of the local AHEPA chapter,  "withdrew their membershil
 
and formed another parish, that of Holy Cross,  [whose]  aims and purposes bein�
 
of course the same, but in a manner more to their liking"  (The United Greek
 
Orthodox Community "Holy Trinity-Holy Cross" 1956: n.p.).
 
At first, not formally recognized by the Archdiocese, this group was led
 
bv a maie tria tria  [
group of three],  including Christu
 (
Petrou 1979: 22;
 
1977:  15-37). 
The group advertised in the New York Greek newspaper
 
:
._lantis for a priest, and hired Father Dionysios Dimitsanos from Corfu in
 
33.
 Services had previously been held in the Fraternal Hall, but within
 
,
ree months the dissident parish had 150 members and had begun extensive
 
A
id-raising efforts to build its own church.
 This was accomplished in 1934,
 
th the aid of AHEPA and other community members, and the first Holy Cross
 
[Agia Starvoul church was built at North 25th Street between Seventh and
 
Eighth Avenues in Birmingham.
 From the outset, Greek School classes, taught
 
by one of the two teachers originally in contention at Holy Trinity, Mr.
 
Anagnostou, were held in the church buildinQ.

This competition between the two parishes extended throughout the Birming-
ham Greek community, and in 1931, Holy Trinity (
"the original church") bought
 
the properties next door and erected a new educational building.
 In 1935 the
 
dissident parish, Holy Cross, was officially recognized by the Archdiocese and
 
a canonical priest, Fater Milelis, was sent to replace Dimitsanos, who had
 
resigned because of a salary dispute (
Christgu 1977:  30) .
 In 1938 Holy Cross
 
built a new church next door to its old one, again with AHEPA's aid, and began
 
using the former church as an educational building.
 In 1949, after some dis-
agreement about relocation to an area nearer the homes of one community group,
 
Holy Trinity built a new church (the present one)  on its old site  (dedicated
 
and consecrated in 1956), and in the same year Holy Cross built a new Youth
 
Center (dedicated in 1951),  for educational and recreational purposes.
 
Reconciliation efforts began seriously in the 1947.
 Most of the Greek
 
Americans in Birmingham interviewed about the split agreed that it was unfor-
tunate, but rationalized the community factionalism by drawing on Greek pro-
verbial lore.

 Everybody wanted to be chiefs.

That's the trouble.
 That's the trouble with Greeks  (Tape log ES82-
Mc/C-Cl4).
 
It was the social activities of the youth groups of both parishes that finally
 
reunited the Greek American community in Birmingham.
 The factionalism between
 
the two churches had divided the entire community for thirty years, during
 
which time the community's mutual aid and church-affiliated organizations,
 
including the church youth groups, had also split off into separate chapters.
 
In the 1950s, the t-
,A
To church youth groups --Holy Trinity's Elliniki Ortho-
doxy Neolea (
EON)  and Holy Cross'  Orthodoxy Elliniki Neolea (OEN)--began
 
opening their social and recreational functions to one another  (
Petrou 1979:
 
35). 
In 1950 the Greek Orthodox Youth of America  (GOYA), a national orga-
nization aimed at the unification of independent GreekAmerican youth groups
 
across the country, was founded.
 The two local youth organizations, EON
 
and OEN, became separate chapters.
 When Birmingham was chosen, however,
 
in 1953 to host the third annual GOYA convention, members of both EON and
 
OEN joined in its planning, and the occasion resulted in the reunification
 
of Birmingham's two Greek Orthodox parishes.

the reconciled 1500 member-parish "The United Greek Orthodox Community of
 
Holy Trinity-Holy Cross of Birmingham, Alabama," specified that a new priest
 
would be brought in to serve the community, and the usages of both parishes'
 
new buildings were clearly outlined.  The Holy Trinity Educational Building
 
was to be used for joint Sunday School and Greek School classes; the Holy
 
Cross Youth Center was to be used for all parish social functions.
 This
 
mutual use of each parish's former property appears to have continued until
 
the 1970s, when the unified parish sold the property of the old Holy Cross
 
Church, after it had been damaged in a fire.  To "satisfy the newer genera-
tion," Holy Trinity-Holy Cross replaced the old Educational Building with a
 
modern one, named "The Hellenic Orthodox Christian Center," which was dedi-
cated in 1973  (
Petrou 1979: 43).
 (
See Appendix F-1, "Holy Trinity-Holy Cross
 
Greek Orthodox Church Education Building Fund.")
 The fine,  large building,
 
used today, contains Sunday school classrooms, the Greek language school
 
classrooms, a parish library, social halls, a gymnasium/auditorium, meeting
 
rooms, and offices.
 
Today Holy Trinity-Holy Cross is the third largest Greek Orthodox parish
 
in the South, ranking behind Atlanta and Houston, and is the largest congre-
gation and the only cathedral in the state of Alabama.
 Other smaller Greek
 
Orthodox parishes exist in Montgomery, Huntsville, and Mobile, and the
 
a "mission parish" as well, in Daphne, Alabama (Appendix C-3, Field Nc
 
Interview with Fr. Emanuel Z. Vasila
.kis,  14 April 1982).
 Since the 19
 
reunification, the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross parish has had five priests,
 
including Fr. Vasilakis.
 (
See also list of "United Communities" in Apper
.
 
F-b .)
 A variety of church-affiliated groups continue to fill an important
 
aspect of the parish's religious, educational, and social missions--youth
 
groups like GOYA  (Greek Orthodox Youth Association), a nationally -based
 
organization for ages 14 through high school,  and the YAL  (Young Adult
 
League), founded local
`ly in the 1970s for ages 18 to 35; women's social
 
and philanthropic organizations like the Knit-Chat-Chew club and the Philop-
tochos Society chapter;  and Political lobbying groups like the nationally -
organized UHAC  (United Hellenic American Congress).
 (
See also "Community
 
organizations and Activities," below.)
 
At the present time,  the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross roster lists 650 mem-
bers  (approximately 575 families), the majority of whorn
.--approximately 75%
 
according to Vasilakis--are "ethnic Greek," although the parish includes a
 
mix of Lebanese, Palestinian, Russian, Ukrainian,"American," and other non-
Greek nationalities.
 While the problem of marriage outside the Greek Ortho-
dox faith or to a member of a non-Greek ethnic group is still an active
 
issue in the community, it is not as volatile as in times past.
 The issue
 
of the liturgical language, on the other hand,  is a controversial one among
 
parishioners, with the community split between those wanting to further
 
increase the percentage of the liturgy that is in English  (which has increased
 
from 50% Greek/50% English to 35% Greek/65% English since Vasilakis , arrival
 
eighteen months ago)  and those wanting a return to services that are entirely
 
in Byzantine Greek.

Holy Trinity-Holy Cross parishioner C
. W. Jovaras characterized what he
 
also perceives as three factions within the Birmingham Greek American com-
munity in this way:
 
You [
have], you know, people living in different communities--
Ensley, Fairfield, Bessemer, Homewood, Vestavia, Hoover, Mountain
 
Brook--over the mountain, under the mountain [
laughter], outside
 
of Birmingham, and I think that makes a big difference also
 
I can seriously say [we] have "die-hards," "middle-of-the-roaders,"
 
and "I don't care."  You have a good fifty-fifty mix of "die-hards"
 
and "middle-of--the-roaders" in Birmingham (Tape log ES82-Mc/C-C12).
 
The attitudes of each of these three groups--members of whom are repre
 
in our group of informants--toward ethnic heritage,  language maintenan
 
and cultural heritage will be discussed in following sections of this rei
 
The residence of the parishioners are dispersed.  Groups two and three,
 
the most part, have moved, in Fr. Vasilakis' words,  "over the mountain," out
 
of the earlier Greek neighborhoods in the city to the more affluent suburbs
 
that lie south of downtown Birmingham and east of the heavy-manufacturing
 
satellite towns like Ensley.
 These settlement patterns, and their change
 
over time,  are a critical component in our study of the various Greek Schools
 
at the Holy Trinity, Holy Cross, and reunited Holy Trinity-Holy Cross par-
ishes in Birmingham.
 
History of St.  Elias Maronite Catholic Church

to assimilate into the "universal" Latin Rite.
 The Latin bishops directly
 
thwarted Maronite efforts to create autonomous churches and schools and to
 
practice their rituals in the Antiochean style and the Aramaic/Syriac and
 
Arabic languages.
 It was not until the second Vatican Council in 1965 that
 
the integrity of the Eastern Rites became a policy of the Roman church.
 
Catholics are no w instructed to follow the rite of their fathers where a
 
parish of that rite exists.
 
Thus the Lebanese Maronites found themselves in something of a double
 
bind.
 On the one hand they needed to respond affirmatively with a clear,
 
nationally-based sense of ethnicity, if they were to withstand assimilation
 
into the American mainstream.  And on the other they had to convince the
 
American Catholic Church that their demands for separate institutions were
 
based not on national, but on doctrinal differences.
 In St. Elias today
 
the debate continues.
 The priest identifies himself not as a Lebanese, but
 
as a Maronite Catholic.
 However his parishioners see the Maronite Church
 
as the inst±t tiona1 core of their
 
important determinants of the pra
 
education in the parish.
 
The Lebanese community in Birmingham was established in the years fol-
lowing 1890, up until the immigration restrictions in 1924.
 Most migrated
 
first to the Northeast or Great Lakes area cities, and thence to Alabama.
 
The founding Lebanese families in Birmingham originated in the farming vii
 
lages in the area around Zahie, in central Lebanon.
 They came to Alabama
 
attracted by opportunities to enter into itinerant trade among rural resi-
dents and in the growing mining, steel, and iron workers'  settlemcr
.
 
They did not often choose farming, or even industrial wage labor,
 
ethnic community.
 These distinctions are

they intended to return to the old country and because the tenant faf
lner
 
and sharecropping agricultural system prevalent in this region was anti-
thetical to their experience and ambitions as independent small farmers.
 
Rather, most became peddlars, travelling the back roads carrying notiQns,
 
dry goods,  and hand-crafted items on their backs.
 The profit was high, the
 
investment low, only minimal English was necessary, and a route and a stock
 
could be obtained from more established Lebanese who owned shops and orga-
nized routes for newcomers.
 As they became permanent settlers, they often
 
moved from peddling into shopkeeping and wholesale grocery and produce
 
businesses.

:
 into the 1960s St. Elias was one of only two Maronite churches in the
 
Southeast.
 The other, in Atlanta, was much smaller.
 According to Fr. Saad,
 
"Birmingham was the main community" in the region.
 In 1905 the Lebanese
 
also founded the Phoenician Club, a men's social and service organization.
 
It has evolved into today's Cedars Club, a recreational, social, and meeting
 
facility funded by memberships and open to any area residents of Lebanese
 
ancestry and their families.
 
St. Elias was established under the authority of the Antiochean Patri-
arch and he supplied the parish with a series of priests from Lebanon.
 How-
ever, once established, it became a responsibility of the Latin Rite Dio-
cese in all other matters and held financial obligations to the bishop and
 
C nk i n
 call
 
S
 
to the Latin parochial schools.
 St. Elias experienced considerable attri-
tion in its membership over the first 30 years, although it does not appear
 
to have been as high as the estimated 50% reported for Maronite congrega-
tions nationally (Kayal 1974: 125).
 They remained in their original, tem-
porary, and inadequate quarters as the community settled away from the
 
church area into the southwest-side Glen Iris and Idlewild neighborhoods.
 
Finally, in 1939, the church was closed for lack of a priest; appeals t o  the
 
Patriarchate went unanswered for over six months.
 Then the community
 
directly contacted a priest who happened to be visiting his brother in
 
Detroit and obtained permission for Fr. Joseph Ferris Abi-Chedid to cc
 
to Birmingham, rather than returning to his monastery in Lebanon.
 
When Abi-Chedid arrived only 61 members reassembled as the St. Elias
 
parishioners.  The only remaining functioning organization was the Ladies'
 
Altar Society, which raised $311 to add to the church treasury of $7.87, so
 
that Abi-Chedid could reopen the building and begin calling the Maronites
 
together again.
 Abi-Chedid quickly learned sufficient English to read the
 
Gospel and to communicate with the Birmingham business and professional com-
munity.
 He set about to obtain property in the Lebanese neighborhood and
 
managed to have almost a full city block of land donated to the parish.
 In
 
1949 the construction was begun on the present church building at 836 Eighth
 
Avenue South.
 At the time of his retirement and return to Lebanon in 1970,
 
the complex consisted of the church, a parish house, an auditorium/cafeteria,
 
and a four-classroom educational building.
 There were plans for an additional
 
four classrooms and a small convent.
 Each of the buildings was paid for in
 
cash money raised primarily through the Ladies' Altar Society weekly Lebanese
 
dinners, which became a veritable institution for many Birmingham customers.
 
After Abi-Chedid, the church had a series of short-term resident priests
 
and in 1972 the present priest, Fr. Richard Saad, was appointed to St. Elias.
 
r
e 
�q.
 
Saad is the first American-born priest at St.  Elias,  a member of one of the
 
first classes to graduate at the American Maronite Seminary in Washington,
 
D.C.
 Although of Lebanese descent, he is also the first priest not to speak
 
Arabic fluently.
 Saad has concentrated his efforts on  consolidating the
 
membership,  reaching out to Maronites who have turned to the Latin Rite,  and
 
restoring the teaching and celebration of the Maronite Rite.
 With the help
 
of the Ladies' Altar Society, he has begun converting one classroom into a
 
library--one of only two or three such Maronite libraries in the United
 
States.
 
St.  Elias now has 260 active families,  totaling 800-1000 people, most
 
of whom are Lebanese and of Lebanese descent  (
Fr.  Saad:
 "a few non-Lebanese,
 
mostly through marriage;" James Mezrano:
 "seven-eigths Lebanese" with other
 
Catholics who prefer the high-church, older ritual of the Maronite mass).
 
These numbers reflect post-1965 immigration, especially of educated, profes-
sional people displaced by recent conflicts in the Middle East.
 St. Elias
 
is now one of three Maronite churches in the Southeast  (a third,  after Bir-
mingham and Atlanta, has been established in Miami)  and one of 50 churches
 
and five missions in the United States.
 In 1962 the Pope authorized an
 
Apostolic Exarch to the United States, with a mission to unify the American
 
Maronites.
 The Exarch at Detroit became Bishop of the Eparchy  (Diocese)  of
 
St. Maron of the USA in 1971 and the Maronites were removed from the author-
ity of the Latin hierarchy.
 The Eparchy is now administered from its seat
 
at Brooklyn, New York, and oversees not only the churches and missions but
 
the seminary in Washington and a convent in Youngstown, Ohio.
 Nationally,
 
Maronites number over 36,000  (1979 official Catholic Dixectory).

extend his outreach to Maronites in the Nashville, Tennessee, and Mobile,
 
Alabama, areas who now worship in Latin Rite churches.
 St. Elias maintains
 
friendly relations with St. George Melkite church, only three blocks away,
 
and their parishioners sponsor some joint activities.
 St. Elias is the
 
meeting place for the A
merican-Lebanese Alliance, though it occasionally
 
meets at St. George in order to demonstrate its ethnic, non-denominational
 
basis.
 The two major religious festivals celebrated at St. Elias, as well
 
as other Maronite churches, are the Feast of St. Maron, February 9 (Latin
 
calendar February 14), and the Feast of St. Elias, July 20 (Latin calendar
 
July 25).

LANGUAGE SCHOOL HISTORIES
 
History of Holy Trinity, Holy Cross, and Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Greek Schools 
The first language classes in Birmingham's Greek Orthodox community were
 
offered shortly after the founding of Holy Trinity Church, and as early as c
.
 
1907 daily afternoon Greek School classes, taught by Mrs. Stamatina, were
 
held in a "shack" behind the church.
 She was followed by Andrea Kopoulos  [or
 
Mr. Andriakopoulos],  who lived above the Greek School.
 He was also a cantor
 
at Holy Trinity, and early parish records indicate that his salary was higher
 
than that of the priest (
Petrou 1979: 25).
 Its Hellenistic focus was clear
 
in the stated purpose of the first school:
 so "Americanized children  [would
 
be]  secure in Greek thought, legend, and tradition."
 (

197780-1, frames 4 to 6, for copystanded pages from Holy Trinity-Holy Cross,
 
Hellenic Orthodox Christian Center, Dedication Book, Birmingham, Alabama,
 
1972-73.)
 The value of both Greek language maintenance and English language
 
acquisition were recognized as well by the fledgling Greek Orthodox parish
 
in Birmingham and
 its
 initial mutual aid organizations were instrumental
 
in organizing and fundraising for language education.
 In 1910 the Young
 
Greeks Progressive Society was conductinq English jan0ua0e olasses f
r
or the
 
150 young businessmen who consti
.tu -sod its  me moersis - .
 A
orou
 of
 reek  women
 
attended weekly sessions at a school on Highland Avenue  (
Petrou 1979: 23).
 
In 1911 a local chapter of the Pan Hellenic Union was organized in Birmingha
 
with its objective being "to plan and fund the Greek school"  (
Petrou 1979:
 
27)
 
The earliest Greek School classes were held for three hours daily,
 
Monday through Saturday, from June to September, in one room which accomodated
 S
 
Conklin/McCallum--29

S
 
all elementary grades, with the teacher's time being divided among various
 
grade levels.
 As many as 90 students at one time--desks arranged according
 
to age and ability--studied Greek grammar, history, geography, literature,
 
mythology,  folk songs, drama, and dialogue.
 Exercise drills occurred on
 
Saturdays, when religion was also taught and athletics practiced.
 The only
 
available curricular materials were those imported from Greece by the teacher;
 
the teacher often had the only official books and students were required to
 
copy lessons from the blackboard into their tetradia [notebooks]  (oral history
 
interview with Eula Triantos, in Petrou 1979: 24).
 Rote learning, memoriza-
tion, and recitation were the standard learning methods.
 Strict disciplinary
 
measures were the rule.
 Christine Graminas, who attended Greek School classes
 
from 1917 to 1922, describes the curricular materials and pedagogical methods
 
used by Father Nicholas Lambrinides, the revered multilingual teacher who had
 
been trained in Constantinople before coming to America and who is widely
 
remembered, even though he only spent six years in Birmingham:
 
We had only one book: the reader.  All the rest of the subjects he
 
would write on the board.
 Like for history, for instance, and we
 
would copy it, start on scrap paper.
 He demanded that we would put
 
it in a composition book in calligraphy--and I mean without smudges,
 
without misspellings .
 .
 .
 and that way we had the pretty handwrit-
ing and that way we would memorize what we wrote and we'd remember
 
our history and religion topics and geography.
 He stressed geogra-
phy.
 Oh yeah
 He would have the islands made in poetic form and
 
we would point them out as we recited them.  We would point them
 
out and if we made one little mistake we'd get a whack on the hand.
 
He was very strict but we learned.
 He made us learn.
 I knew the
 
Greek geography as if I did, better than I knew the U.S. map.
 And
 
I enjoyed it.
 I enjoyed the Greek School .

Maude Morgan, another second-generation Birmingham Greek, recalls her early
 
experiences in the "Hellenic" classes from c
.1922 to 1928:
 
It was just a little, a house actually, to start with, that they
 
had bought and converted into the Greek School.
 And my mother hap-
pened to be on the Board of Education for the Greek School, so I

had to be, get to be at school on time .
 .
 .
 Actually the curricu-
lum was reading, grammar, writing, of course, and not penmanship
 
writing, but what they used to call orthographia, which was the cor-
rect spelling .
 .
 .
 And correct grammar.
 It started from the six-
year old and went on up to 17 at least.  .
 .
 You know I don't know
 
how long I went to Greek School.
 It seemed like it was forever.
 
And our written examination we had, would write for weeks ahead of
 
time and then all our papei would be hung like on a line, you know,
 
so that our parents could view them .
 .
 .
 We had a lot of reading,
 
we read from our lesson, we were assigned lessons .
 .
 .
 that had to
 
be written and then, too, like I said before, orthographia, which
 
we were assigned a verse or whatever, then we had to write this in
 
class the following day and it had to be correct or else we were
 
punished .
 .
 .
 If you were very unruly, or did something very bad
 
we were sent out to cut the switches off the tree and we were
 
switched on our hands, for doing something really bad, you know.
 It
 
all depended on the teacher, what he thought was so terrible  (tape
 
log ES82-Mc/C-C8).
 (
See photo ES82-BMc-197780-1, frame 13.)
 
Both Grammas and Morgan also recall that under Fr. Lambrinides and
 
subsequent teachers, dramatic technique and the production of Greek patriotic
 
plays, accompanied by Greek songs, was an important focus of the school year,
 
and were often highlighted at the annual graduation exercises, held at the
 
Fraternal Hall, or at Birmingham's old Bijou Theatre.
 Christine Grammas:
 
And of course near the end of the semester he would assign us with
 
a poem or dialogue and we'd perform on stage like actresses.
 Really.
 
If we wouldn't act .
 .
 .
 he wanted us to learn expression.
 And he
 
said, "You get out there and you're supposed to cry when you say
 
these words."
 I couldn't cry.
 He whacked me on my legs with a
 
ruler and I cried and he said, "Now say it."
 I said it.  We loved
 
him, we really loved him, but we were scared to death of him, too
 
(
tape log ES82-Mc/C-C9).
 
After Fr. Lambrinides left Birmingham, he was followed by a succession
 
of Greek-born school teachers, including Skarandavos, Valangous, Nenga,
 
Georgopoulos, Anastasiou, and Fr. Lolokas.  Many teachers during this period
 
also travelled on certain weeknights to the steel mill towns of Ensley and
 
Fairfield to hold Greek School classes for the parishioners in those communi-
ties  (
Petrou 1979: 25).
 
In 1926 controversy began to develop in the Birmingham Greek Orthodox
 
community over the hiring of teachers for the Creek School, its site, and

policy-making decisions.
 The argument culminated in the 1933 split of the
 
community, and the formation of the separate Holy Cross parish.
 This resulted
 
in the establishment of a second Greek School in Birmingham, supported by the
 
fund-raising efforts of the AHEPA chapter number three, and by a Holy Cross
 
ladies'  group, Pistis-Elpis-Agapis [
Faith-Hope-Love].
 Holy Cross offered its
 
own "parochial afternoon school of Greek," taught first by Mr. Anagnostu, and
 
then beginning c
.1942 by the church's rector, Rev. D. N. Sakellarides,
 and
 
after 1949 by Christine Sepsas (born c.1913), first cousin to our informants
 
Christine Grainmas and Alexandra Bonduris  (Holy Cross Hellenic Orthodox Com-

n.p.).  Mrs. Sepsas' mother had also been a Greek School teacher, and it
 
seems that she first took pupils into her home, before affiliating with the
 
new Holy Cross parish.
 Alexandra Bonduris describes Christine Sepsas as a
 
"self-taught natural-born teacher," who was prevented from attending college
 
because Greek custom and family finances would only allow her brother to
 
receive a higher education.
 No longer a Greek School teacher, Mrs. Sepsas
 
apparently has returned to offering classes in her home, teaching English to
 
new immigrants to Birmingham.
 (
See tape log ES82-Mc/C-C14.)
 
One teacher, from the Holy Trinity parish, is also widely remembered
 
today in the Birmingham Greek community.
 Irene Kampakis, mother-in-law of
 
our informant Georgia Kampakis, was graduated from a teachers'  school in
 
Athens, and is described by her former students as being "very learned."  With
 
Mrs. Lorant, she was one of the two teachers of Tasia Fifles  (
born 1932),
 
third-generation Greek American and daughter of Christine Grainmas, who
 
attended Greek School at Holy Trinity in the late 1930s and early 40s:
 
The class was divided; each row was a different grade.  And, you
 
know, that's surprising, because every Greek child was going to
 
Conk lin,'Mc Cal l 
um-

Greek School.
 It wasn't just a handful.
 Every Greek child in my
 
generation, every Greek child was going to Greek School, every day,
 
right after school.  We'd get on the bus, get the tickets from the
 
Birmingham Electric Company, because that's what used to be the
 
streetcar .
 .
 .
 we had to run and get the bus at six 'cause they
 
wouldn't take your ticket after six o
'clock on.
 It was packed.
 The
 
street cars were packed.  We had to stand up and everything, you
 
know.  .

It seems that there were no formal Greek School classes in Birmingham
 
during the war years, and by 1953 the two Birmingham Greek Orthodox parishes
 
had reunited.  By the late 50s and into the early 60s, third-generation Greek
 
American parents like Tasia Fifles were reluctant to make the same kind of com-
mitment to Greek language education for their children that their parents had

By the mid-60s and through the early 1970s, Greek School classes at the
 
united Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Church had decreased to once-a-week evening
 
classes, with a very high attrition rate by the end of the school year.
 Two
 
of our informants  (Georgia Kampakis and Janice Mastoras)  had school-aged chil-

School for a few months, and the experience was "not very beneficial" for

dialect, unpopular here.
 Nichi Jovaras, who immigrated to the U.S. in the
 
1950s, describes his pedagogical methods and how she herself took over some
 
of his students, c.1978 or 1979, and became a Greek School teacher at Holy

For the past four years, Nichi jovaras has taught Greek language classes
 
at Holy Trinity-Holy Cross on one or two weekday evenings; this past semester
 
she taught a two-hour Tuesday evening class to a mixed group of students, but
 
tneir attendance was irregular and attrition rates were high.
 During this
 
time,  and apparently up through this year Theodor (Ted)  Lafakis, also a native
 
Greek speaker, taught some afternoon and evening Greek School classes, with
 
many of the same problems  (Papazoglou 1982: 29).

of English, by Kartina, published in New York in 1952, it is printed in
 
Greek, English "phonetics," and English translation, focusing on exercises
 
for social and business conversation and story and letter writing.
 Her stu-
dents included fourth-generation Greek American children, as well as spouses
 
converted to Greek Orthodoxy through intermarriage, and she described their
 
mixed attitudes toward language acquisition:
 
Now I do have students in that class that would rather not use the
 
English phonetics, but read it in Greek, and they do, but I did
 
find out one thing--the non-Greeks that within a marriage, that
 
that within the Greek faith [through intermarriage]  they're more
 
receptive to learn than the ones that actually are Greek because
 
they apply themselves because that's what they're there for.
 They
 
have an aim within themselves to do something so they are the ones
 
that are really my best students.
 They are learning, because that's
 
what they are applying themselves to do .
 .

 No, we don't have his-
tory, all we're doing is strictly conversation, but, like I said,
 
they do know the alphabet.
 They do know how to read in Greek, if
 
they do want to read it in Greek, but most of them will read in
 
English .

Themis Kannellopoulos, born in 1949 into a trilingual (Greek, French,
 
English) home and educated as an engineer, came to Birmingham in 1979, and
 
during his first year in the Greek Orthodox parish, team-taught Greek School
 
with Mrs. Jovaras on weekday evenings.
 In 1979 or 1980 they split the classes
 
in half, and Themis now teaches a Saturday morning Greek School class at Holy
 
Trinity-Holy Cross for adults only.
 This past semester he had six students
 
in this class:  his wife Sheree, a third-generation Greek American who came
 
to Birmingham from Florida in 1980 when they were married; a student who has
 
not been attending regularly because she has a new baby; an "American" won
 
who married a first-generation Greek; and Terri Grainmas, an ethnic Irish
 
recent convert from Roman Catholicism married to a second-generation Birming-
ham Greek American 20 years her senior.
 Their two daughters have also been
 
attending Saturday Greek language classes with her.
 Terri Grarnmas describes
 
her daughters' ethnic identification, and their attitudes toward Greek School:
 
.  . [
They]  are very close to their background, 
The Greek is def-
inateiy prevalent.
 My children are so Greek-oriented that when
 
they filled out applications for school  [a special public school
 
gifted child program]--they're 12 and 14--and they asked for nation-
ality, they put down Greek . . . And I was in a state of shock.  It
 
didn't occur to me that they would ever consider anything but Ameri-
can, but, you know, the Greek is really ingrained in them . . .

Kanellopoulos'  classes are scheduled to resume, aftcr a hiatus for his
 
students'  and his own vacations, and are expected to continue in the fall,
 
wi th many of the same students, some beginning their third and fourth years
 
of attendance in his class.
 Jovaras also plans to teach again in the fall.
 
According to the commitment of the teachers and the attitude of the prie .
 
toward Greek School classes at Holy Trinity-Holy Cross, there seems no rea.
 
to believe that the level of language education activity will diminish in the
 
foreseeable future.

History of St. Elias Arabic School
  
S
 
The first Arabic language classes were organized at St. Elias in 1915,
 
just five years after the founding of the parish.
 During the early years
 
they were conducted by Khattar Wehby, one of the few well-educated immigrants.
 
(
See photo of 1915-16 class E582-BMc-196408-2,  frame 2, and ES82-BMc-195995-
3, frame 1
; portrait of Khattar and Sultana Mickwee Wehby,  frame 00; and a
 
late 1910s class ES82-BMc-195995-3,  frames 4 and 5.)
 These classes at first
 
took place in a section of the old church and later at a location he obtained
 
for the purpose.  Wehby taught as a volunteer, on top of his business activi-
ties.
 He gave daily after-school classes, lasting several hours.
 Both stu-
dents and the teacher were bilingual in Arabic and English and classes were
 
conducted in both languages.  Their purpose was to make the children literate
 
in Arabic and familiar with Arabic/Lebanese literature and to supplement the
 
cultural education they were receiving in the local Latin parochial schools.
 
These classes were not successful for very long.
 Josephine Wehby Sharbel
 
describes her father's efforts  (
this and all other citations from Sharbel from
 
tape log ES82-Mc/C-C3):
 
He didn't receive cooperation.
 And you know he didn't want any-
thing from them.
 He'd say, "Give me your children.
 I don't want
 
anything.
 Just let me teach them"  .
 .
 .
 Well, it just wasn't sup-
ported.
 I mean, in that they didn't cooperate with Papa.
 Maybe
 
the parents, you know, kind of just drifted away.
 And then my
 
father just got disgusted and he just quit.
 
Wehby pursued his work, starting classes each fall through the 1910s and
 
into the 1920s, but the consistent attrition discouraged him.
 
Textbooks in the Wehby schoolroom were grammars, dictionaries, histories,
 
and poetry and essay volumes that he had brought with him from Lebanon.
 
Conklin/McCajlum- -38
 
Although he himself was trained in Classical Arabic, it was the vernacular
 
which was taught and spoken.
 "We learned the alphabet, we learned to read,
 
to spell.
 We learned poetry and songs"  [
Sharbel].
 Except for the songs, the
 
efforts were directed toward refining the children's language skills.
 Jose-
phine Sharbel recalls that the instruction was:
 
More or less, I would say. conversationa l.
.  And the spelling, and
 
things like that.
 But barely writing.
 Cause I don't think we
 
ever got to the point where we were doing too much writing.
 Spe-
cially not the print.
 I think we were printing more or less.
 
Elizabeth Boohaker and her brothers also attended the Wehby classes for
 
Arabic-speaking children.
 She reports similar results  (this and all other
 
citations from Elizabeth Boohaker from tape log ES82-Mc/C-C4):
 
And the reason
 
and we sang in
 
ing, you know,
 
Now, script, I
 
we learned, we took part in the choir at the church
 
Arabic.
 And we took the books and would start read-
out of the books, the Arabic language.
 Ah, print.
 
can't read, but I can read print.
 
The next serious efforts at language education did not take place until
 
Fr. Joseph Abi-Chedid became priest of St. Elias in 1940.
 (
See photos ES82-
BMc-196408-1, frame 5, and slide ES82-BMc-3, number 17.)
 He came to Birming-
ham intending to open a full-day Maronite parochial school.
 Elizabeth
 
Boohaker recalls his arrival:
 
The people were hungry for a new church.
 In fact he didn't want
 
to build a new church first; he wanted to open a school first.
 
He says--which is true--"without the school you have no parish "
 
The children are going to disperse, they're going to go to other
 
places, they're going to learn other cultures, and you  -
lust won't
 
have, won't have your parish.
 
But the school building was not immediately forthcomino, so Abi-Chedid
 
introduced Arabic classes for the young people during after-school hours  n
'
 
on Saturdays.
 James Mezrano was one of his pupils  (

He tried to teach us Arabic, but his bedside manners were very
 
rough and the children were very scared of him.
 We'd just shake.
 
He was just very stern and strict and, I don't know, we just
 
couldn't learn from him.
 
These now were not Arabic-speaking children or Arabic/English bilinguals, but
 
second- and third-generation Birmingham Lebanese, who had, at best, passive
 
knowledge of the language.
 Mezrano characterizes his own skills as typical:
 
he can understand a considerable amount, but he cannot respond; nor can he
 
read or write Arabic.
 
Even though they  [his generation's parents]  knew Arabic, and we
 
were spoken  by
 them in Arabic, and I understood it, we were
 
never taught to speak it fluently.
 
Abi-Chedid emphasized conversation, pronunciation drill  (physically trying
 
to force laryngeals out of his pupils), the alphabet. 
The classes would
 
begin again and again and fail because the children dropped out after a month
 
or so. 
"I guess that's why I know the alphabet so well;" says Mezrano,  "we
 
went through it so many times."  Although these experiences were not promis-
ing, Abi-Chedid did not waver from his determination to have a school at St.
 
Elias that would replace the Latin parochial educations l
ie was attempting to
 
supplement.
 
At his membership's wish, Abi-Chedid built -
first the new church and then
 
the rectory, and finally in 1958 the prospective school's auditorium/cafeteria
 
and in 1960 the first four of the planned eight classrooms.
 The completed
 
complex would be in the shape of a cross.
 The school was to have eight gr_,(
�, 
and teach all subjects required by the state.
 And, in addition, the Lebane.
 
heritage and the Maronite Rite.
 working with the Ladies'  Altar Society and
 
the Knightsof St. Maron, a special parish organization established for the
 
purpose, Abi-Chedid raised the monies necessary for the first half of the
 
school building which now stands and further established a trust fund desig-
Conklin/McCallum---40
 
nated specifically for the school.
 The school fund totalled $250,000 when
 
he retired from the parish in 1969.
 The school fund was kept separate from
 
all other church accounts, so that it could be hidden from the Latin bishop,
 
who regarded a school at St. Elias as unnecessary competition with the exist-
ing parochial schools and who generally resented the Maronites "outshining"
 
[Mezrano' s term] him.  Abi-Chedid had tied up the money in such a fashion
 
that he felt it was safe from the Latin bishop, then their overseer, but one
 
of his successor priests brought the existence of the fund to the attention
 
of the newly-appointed Maronite bishop.
 A struggle ensued which made the
 
question of Maronite education the most divisive issue in St. Elias' history.
 
Elizabeth Boohaker was church secretary under Abi-Chedid:
 
This money in the trust fund was placed by an organization in the
 
church that was working toward building a school.
 It was a St.
 
Maron organization.  And they put the money in the trust fund so
 
the  [Latin] bishop wouldn't get his hands on it and draw every-
thing out of it .
 .
 .
 When the school came up [
i.e., was built and
 
ready to occupy], you see, we got a new pastor after he [Abi-Chedid]
 
left.
 The new pastor got wind of this .
 .
 .
 and let the bishop
 
know it.  Well, by that time we had our own [Maronite] bishop.
 
And he says, "that's church money, and it should not be a trust"
 
The bishop sued the parishioners for it.
 And they went to
 
court and the court decreed--I don't know how they got up with
 
this kind of decree--that the parish would get $5000 a year out
 
of each trust--there were two trusts--to operate the parish
 
And the bishop got--you know how much he taxes us a year?
 $12,000
 
a year.
 
In effect, the school money was split between the bishop and the local parish,
 
but the parish's portion was to be drawn into the general fund and away from
 
the school project.
 The fund is now virtually depleted.
 And, as our infn
 
mants
 
treasu
 
Thus the parish owns a

vacant.
 In such a situation,  it is unlikely that the school issue would
 
easily disappear from memory.
 And indeed, the parishioners today and the
 
current priest both report that over ten years later it is the key to the
 
factionalization within the congregation.
 The complex relationship between
 
advocacy of the school and the old country/American split is explored in the
 
section on "Institutionalized Education" below.
 
Advocates of the school foresee a full curriculum of public/parochial
 
school subjects and supplementary subjects, including Lebanese history and
 
culture, the Maronite Rite, and the Arabic language.
 Mezrano believes that
 
Arabic should be begun "at an early age--two or three;  I think it would be
 
great for the younger, because it's easier for them to speak at that time."
 
Elizabeth Boohaker describes it this way:
 
Well, they would teach them who they are, you know.
 And where they
 
came from.
 Teach them the history of Lebanon, from the time of the
 
Phoenicians to the time of our present day.  Situation

 Later the parish contacted nuns at the

 waiting to teach and the bishop did not
 
encourage them.  We have a bishop who is not very aggressive.
 He
 
did not encourage them.
 They finally got disgusted and went back
 
to Lebanon [
Boohaker].
 
e and her family and friends have now discussed the question with four
 
Latin nuns of St. Rose of Lima in Birmingham who attend St. Elias and who
 
report themselves willing to learn the Rite and take on the jobs.
 Mezrano
 
prefers to look to Lebanese nuns.
 They are European-educated, he says, and
 
multi-lingual.
 His group's plan would be to send them to Sacred Heart Col-
lege at Cullman, Alabama, until they pass the state teacher certification
 
examination.
 If established, the St. Elias school would be the only Maronite
 
school in the United States.
 
Alongside the controversy about a Maronite parochial school, Arabic
 
language classes have continued to take place at irregular intervals.
 In
 
the 1970s an ethically Lebanese priest from St. George Melkite offered classes
 
at St. Elias.
 Josephine Sharbel attended and enjoyed the classes, but the
 
parish children could not keep up:
 
We had one priest of the Melkite church.
 He was very learned.
 He
 
taught, taught a higher grade, where the young ones could not--you
 
have to start from the beginning.  .
 .
 I went when the priest was
 
teaching.
 Because I knew a little bit higher Arabic and I could,
 
you know, appreciate it and learn it.
 
In recent years there have been classes given by seminarians from
 
Lebanon  nterniiiq under Fr.  Saad.
 One man, who was at St. Elias for three
 
summers,  1978-80, offered Arabic classes twice as part of the "Summer Enrich-
ment Program."  This program for families includes Lebanese cooking, movies,
 
crafts, and other "enriching activities"  [
Saad]. 
James Mezrano attended with
 
his wife and older children.
 He says that:

While the Summer Enrichment Program itself lasted only four weeks, the weekly
 
Arabic classes continued throughout the summer.
 Saad observes that attrition
 
was high:
 perhaps 80 started the class in 1980 and 10 remained at the end
 
(
fieldnotes of interview at University of Alabama, April 27).
 
This summer-Saad has an intern, Mr
- Joseph Koury, who is not a Lebanese,
 
but rather a Lebanese _
�merican who does not meet even the minimum Arabic
 
skills guidelines established by the bishop.
 In order to expose Koury to
 
the language and to renew the Arabic teaching at the school, Saad arranged
 
with an immigrant elementary teacher, Jackie Akl, to offer a children's class.
 
Unlike most of the post-1965 immigrants, the Akl family is highly language -
retentive, behavior which Saad attributes to their plans to return to
 
Lebanon.
 Mrs.  Akl teaches her own daughter at home; she agreed to take on
 
other children in the 6 to 10 age group.
 An announcement in the Sunday bul-
letin drew not only children but a number of adults.

teacher, Michael Wehby,

Both classes meet

 This time is usually devoted to religious
 
instruction, which will be resumed in the fall.
 If the classes continue, they
 
will have to be arranged for another time.
 The adults had hoped for a weekday
 
evening, longer session, but their teacher was not available any other time.
 
Conklin/McCallum--44
 
As Koury and Saad describe the children's class, it now has just over 10
 
children.
 Mrs. Aki is introducing the alphabet, reading and writing, counting,
 
rhymes for word memorization, and other such material, using photocopies of
 
elementary school books she used in Lebanon.
 She assigns homework tasks of
 
rewriting, copying, and translating--which the pupils have completed dili-
gently.
 The seven or eight adults have requested conversational Arabic and
 
tneir time is devoted to speaking, not reading and writing, with the exception
 
of learning the characters associated with the sounds which have no parallel
 
in English.
 Practical conversational phrases seem to be the main emphasis.
 
This appears to be the first course at St. Elias genuinely following the oral
 
conversation approach.
 So far the attendance has been good and enthusiasm
 
high.  Most of the adult students have minor passive knowledge of Arabic,
 
but cannot speak it.
 Saad expects the classes to go on into the fall, if
 
interest continues as at present.

ETHNIC MAINTENANCE
 
Institutionalized Education: 
The Greeks 
S
 
The factionalism over the Greek School in the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross
 
parish that split the community for 30 years no longer dominates this commu-
nity.
 It is thought of as a remote event.
 However, vestigial factors under-
lying the controversy are manifested in parishioners'  attitudes toward ccr
nruni-
nity identity and the value of, rationale for, and problems in sustaininq
 
effective ethnic heritage and language education programs.
 Community op--
about the Greek School--its past history, present status, and prospects
 
the future--do often correlate with factors such as time of immigration, gei
 
ation/age group, occupation, class status, education, city or suburban resi-
dence, native and home language, and ethnic and religious traditionalism or
 
assimilationism, all of which were important elements in the controversy.
 
Terri Grammas, a relative newcomer through intermarriage to the Birmingham
 
Greek Orthodox community, characterizes its composition, as do other infor-
mants, with reference to various of these factors:
 
In the Greek community, to me, there's two factions.
 The Greeks from
 
the old country [
"Greek Greeks," T. G.] that, I don't even know if
 
they've ever become American citizens .
 .
 .
 Most of the Greeks here
 
still have family in Greece or in Cyprus.
 And I think that has a
 
lot to do with it.
 They do really keep up with the news there; it's
 
surprising.  We  [
her husband's family]  don't.
 You know, because we
 
don't have family there .
 .
 .
 I don't really know how the split has
 
come .
 .
 .
 There will always be a lot of conflict.
 They won't change.
 
They won't change their attitudes, ever.
 There is still a group here
 
that is fighting, every inch of the way .
 .
 .
 I would say [
the other
 
group:  "American Greeks," T. G.] has very educated people--lawyers,
 
doctors, teachers.
 The others  [first group]  are restaurant owners,
 
people that have maybe a high school education, not necessarily in
 
this country, but, you know, some of them do.
 But who have been
 
raised very, strictly Greek.
 You know, spoke Greek in the home  (
tape
 
log E582-Mc/C-07).
 
In addition to Teri
:i Grammas'  polarized "Greek Greeks" and "American Greeks,"
 
a third, mediating position rounds out the Greek parishioners'  own picture of
 
Holy Trinity-Holy Cross ethnic identity.
 Christine Grammas speaks:
 
. . . See, it's what you learn at home.
 You've got to go  [with]
 
what you learn at home.
 You see, when my daddy used to see, when we
 
used to see the Greek flag, well, we mar
 ched and we see that Greek
 
flag waving and the American flag right next to it, why, you know,
 
you' d just have all that patriotism in you for both countries.
 
Because they're right there, side by side  (
tape log ES82-Mc/C-C14).
 
Her sister, Alexandra Bonduris, agrees and defines the ethnic identity trans-
mitted by their father:
 
Papa always said,  "You' re an American.
 Don't ever forget you're an
 
American, but never forget your Greek heritage."
 He instilled that
 
in us  (tape log ES82-Mc/C-C9).
 
Clearly, in the Birmingham Greek community, the strong Greek immigrant
 
imperatives for educational and occupational advancement into the American mi
 
dle class are critical in the study of language and ethnic heritage education
 
and are viewed as paradoxical by members of the community themselves.
 Maude
 
Morgan comments on the Greek "entreprenurial tradition" that coalesces with
 
its American counterpart, the work ethic:

C. W. Jovaras characterizes the community's sense of cultural necessity  for
 
the preservation and perpetuation of the Greek heritage:
 
To me, without traditions it's nothing, that's the way I feel.
 And
 
I hope I can instill this to my children.  Without traditions we are
 
nothing.
 You are blank. Well, really.
 That's the key.
 And tradi-
tions have got to be maintained, not only within the church, but at
 
least within the home, the family, and okay.
 So we change and we,
 
uh, you know, look the other way, you know, when we start raping our
 
various other traditions, in the name of liberalism, and modifica-
tion, and understanding.  But certain traditions, if we eliminate
 
that, why we're back to nothing.
 We're nobody (
tape log ES82-Mc/C-
d O).
 
The current status and future direction of the Greek language school in
 
Birmingham must be examined in relationship to its effectiveness in maintain-
ing this cultural imperative and in reinforcing shared community values.  But
 
there is a considerable range of opinion among the parishioners we interviewed
 
about their own ethnic identification and how it has changed over time, as well
 
as about the importance and functions of the language and cultural components
 
in this maintenance effort.
 For the Greek Orthodox community in Birminghan
'
 
we have a relatively large sample of informants--representing a variety of
 
ions about the history and degrees of commitment to the continuation of Gre
 
School classes.
 It is therefore possible to abstract a small generational sam-
ple, both by age and by length of U.S. residency, in order to isolate and
 
analyze the critical sociocultural factors that interact in shaping the evolu-
tion of the community's attitudes toward mother tongue education.
 
Since the first generation of Greek immigrants in Birmingham are now
 
deceased, the city's second generation of "whitehairs"  [
Fr. Vasilakis] ,
 repre-
sented in this study by Christine Grainmas, Maude Morgan, and Alexandra Bonduris,
 
are the baseline from which to examine generational changes in attitudes toward
 
ethnic and language education.  This group of informants is perhaps the most
 
ethnically retentive, although those cultural elements they chcs
 to  reserve
 
Conklin/Mc Callum-- 48
 
are often archaic relics and survivals from Greece at it was at the time of
 
their parents'  immigration to this country.
 Fr  
.Vasilakis sees them as hav-
ing "a fantasy notion" about their Hellenistic roots.
 These women received a
 
grammar school, or, at best, high school, education.
 Since they grew up dur-
ing the post-World War I period, rampant with nativism (particularly in the
 
Deep South), their memories of experiences outside the Greek Orthodox commu-
nity and of "American [
public]  School" are often unpleasant.
 However,  their
 
memories of attending the ten years or so of mandatory daily Greek School
 
classes are, on the whole, most pleasant and these experiences were clearly
 
ive.
 Greek School attendance reinforced cultural values and
 
in the home, as well as enabling them to learn standard Greek
 
pronunciation and grammar, and teaching them to read and write the Greek col-
ioquial language spoken within the rapidly-growing Greek Orthodox community
 
i
.n Birmingham--the regionally-accented or non-standard Greek dialects that
 
.
,(ere spoken by their parents and used within the larger ethnic community.
 
I
:
hristine Grainmas and Alexandra Bonduris stress that learning to read and
 
,
,r
ite standardized Greek was emphasized in the Greek Schooic, because:
 
We already had [
Greek]  conversation at home  .
 .
 .
 All the chil-
dren at that time did, because the parents couldn't speak English at
 
all.
 And if they did, they wouldn't speak to us because they wanted
 
us to learn the Greek (tape log ES82-Mc/C-C13).
 
It is, in fact, the period prior to 1924, when the flow of new immigrants from
 
the homeland ceased, that these women recall most willingly.
 They speak with
 
a great deal of regret about the later transformation of this homogeneous and
 
self-sustaining Greek Orthodox community, with its large extended family net-
works, comprehensive parental authority and strict discipline, and focus on
 
familial and home life.
 Alexandra Bonduris discusses the far-reaching kinship
 
networks that extended from the patrida into the U.S.
,
 and her parents'  roles

in easing the transition for new arrivals--kin or not--into the Birmingham
 
Greek Orthodox community:
 
Everybody came to our house.
 It wasn't then that you'd go out to
 
eat.  Mama stood over the pot all day long cooking and Papa had a
 
fruit store right opposite to Terminal Station and anybody that
 
came over from Europe would stop at the fruit store.
 And it was
 
always he was telling me, "Call Mama and tell her your uncle is here
 
and I am bringing him home for lunch."
 It didn't matter if it was
 
her cousin, her brother, or what, but if he was Greek he was her
 
uncle
 (
tape log ES82-Mc/C-C9).
 
On the whole, this group of second-generation Greek Americans were upwardly
 
mobile.
 These women's husbands, who began working in Birmingham as street ven-
dors, became wholesalers, retailers, and restaurant owners, and their children
 
achieved a better public school education than they had.
 They are proud of
 
and secure in their cultural preservation and transmission activities, mani-
fested in their unself-conscious continuation of home and external ethnic cus-
toms; their children's attendance of Greek School; their own activities as mem-
bers and officers of the Greek School Board and its "P.T.A."; their firm alle-
giance to Holy Trinity (
Christine Grammas:  "the original church") during the
 
period of divisiveness; and their activity throughout the years in Greek commu-
nity social organizations like the Philoptochos Society and the neighborhood
 
Knit-Chat-Chew group; and their parish work as Sunday School teachers, choir
 
teachers, and library volunteers.
 
They describe their own sense of ethnic identity as "Americans born of
 
Greek descent"
 [
Grammas and Bonduris], and their faith in orthodoxy is so
 
strong and their knowledge of its ritual so long-standing, that they tend to be
 
rather liberal on the issue of the choice of language for the liturgy.
 Chris-
tine Grarnxnas doesn't seem to care which language is used; her sister, Alexandra
 
Bonduris, prefers that it be exclusively in the original Greek.  Maude Morgan
 
states her analysis of the historical relationship between the liturgical lan-

Their children, represented here by Tasia Fifles  (daughter of Christine
 
Grammas), were raised in Birmingham during the 1930s and 40s and came of age
 
in the early 1950s.
 They were better educated, as a group, than their parents,
 
and are upwardly mobile and upper-middle class.
 During the post-war years there
 
was little or no new in-migration from Greece into the Orthodox community in
 
Birmingham, although out-migration was beginning to occur,  and Greek Orthodox
 
spouses came into the Birmingham community from elsewhere in the country  (repre-
sented here by Georgia Kampakis, from Charleston, South Carolina).
 Non-ethnic
 
Greek wives  (
i.e., Janice Mastoras)  also converted to the Greek Orthodox faith
 
during this time, and joined in local community activities.
 Greek American com-
munities all across the country were also undergoing this period of homogeniza-
r
--.
-
on and assimilation into the American mainstream. 
These third-generation
 
immigrants, and their peers by extra-community and inte =
faith marriage, appear
 
to be the least ethnically retentive and most ethnically ambivalent of the Greeks
 
studied.
 They have been highly selective about those elements of their ethnic
 
heritage they choose to preserve,  feel the most guilt about their passivity in
 
transmitting it to their children, and have rejected many of those traditions
 
their parents saw as essential components of their own ethnic education, both

at home and in more institutionalized and public settings.
 Not surprisingl',
 
however, it is this group that has been most active in public display event
 
(
such as the annual Greek Bazaar)  exhibiting external ethnic customs, such
 
foodways, dance, music, and drama,to the public at lar , 
Their identification is clearly as Americans, albeit t
iie Greek Urt odox
 
faith.
 Georgia Kampakis answers the interviewers' question about having strong
 
personal and familial ties to Greece:
 
I really don't [
have them].
 The ties that I have are because my
 
children [adopted as infants] were born there, and of course my
 
mother and father [
in South Carolina].
 I think I
'm just a real Ameri-
can.
 I, I love my heritage.
 I
'm very, very proud of it.  But I real-
really don't have La Greek identity], and I don't think my children
 
have either (
tape log ES82-Mc/C-C8).
 
This group of women did not push their children either to learn the language
 
or to go to Greek School, and their lack of assertion with regard to ethnic
 
heritage and language maintenance is a sore spot with them, even today.
 The
 
problems of their move to the suburbs, increasing interaction with and influ-
ence of their children's American public/parochial school peers and conflicts
 
with extra-curricular activities are most often used as a rationale for their
 
leniency as mothers.  They too, however, like their mothers before them, draw
 
a strong correlation between native home language and the effectiveness of
 
Greek School classes.
 Tasia Fifles discusses the decreasing incidence of con-
versational Greek at home:
 
The only difference in the kids that go to school today and us--I
 
mean I learned Greek because my grandmother, my grandfather were liv-
ing.
 They were from Greece.  My father was from Greece, but he spoke
 
English.
 I mean not well, but he spoke English and we could communi-
cate.
 Course I had to learn Greek because of my grandparents.  We
 
spoke in Greek.  When we went to Greek School we knew what the teacher
 
was telling us.
 I mean, you know, if she told us to shut the door,
 
we could go close the door.
 These kids going to Greek School today
 
don't even know how to count to ten, most of 'em.
 It's cold, they're
 
cold.
 It'd be like you walking into the Greek School class and learn-
ing Greek .
 .
 .
 And I think that's the greatest thing about having a
 
Conklin/McCallum-_ 52
 
grandmother and grandfather that were born in Greece  .
 .
 .
 It's
 
gotten worse.
 I mean, I can't speak Greek like I spoke before.
 
it's got an accent, an American accent to it.
 
Our group interview session at Holy Trinity-Holy Cross cathedral also stressed
 
the interrelationships between language education at home and its institution-
alized component in the parish language classes.
 They agreed that the mother s
 
role in language acquisition was as central as that of the extended family
 
elders, and lamented their capitulation to their children's resistance to
 
attending the Greek School:
 
Kanpakis: 
They've lost a lot by not doing that.
 Like Janice  [Mastoras]
 
and I were saying, when our children say, "I don't want to
 
do that," we tend to say,  "Well, that's ok."  Whenever may-
be we should say, "That's not ok.
 You got to do it.
 
Morgan: 
Now, as a mother--my children are grown--my tendency and
 
Daddy's  [her husband, James]  is to go where we want to be,
 
you know, with our friends, whereas then it was more of a
 
togetherness, the mothers were in charge, the mothers came
 
with us, and--not all the mothers, but mothers were
 
appointed almost like what became the P.T.A. in grammar
 
school.
 
Kampakis: 
I think that the mother's role in the Greek home is very,
 
very important.
 
The Birmingham Greek Orthodox community's fourth generation, who grew up
 
in the late 1960s and 70s, during the era of increased ethnic awareness and
 
ethnic revivalism, clearly define  themselves as Greek American.
 While they
 
perceive their ethnic identity as dualistic, they recognize that this is not
 
necessarily negative, and they are in no sense ambivalent about or unwilling
 
to utilize vital elements of both cultures and transform them into a synthe-
sized whole that can revivify the community's collective sense of self-
identity.
 This fourth-generation group is represented here by Terri Gramma5,
 
a recent convert through interfaith marriage, and Sheree Kannepoulos, a native
 
Greek Orthodox who grew up in Florida outside any Greek Orthodox community and
 
came to Birmingham with her Greek-born husband, Themis.
 These women are
 
S
 
Conklin/McCallum-- _
53
 
S
 
ethnically very self-conscious and aware, and care very much about the revival,
 
renewal, and transmission of Greek ethnic herit
 
 
S
 
S
 
They are learning about the community's external
 i
i
 
ways, music, and dance--from older women by participating in parish social or.
 
nizations, and seem to be making every effort to  reinterpret them, in a mean-
ingful way, within their own home cultures.
 This self-conscious effort at
 
ethnic education in the private domain also carries over into the community
 
arena:
 Graxnmas'  children are active members of JOY (Junior Orthodox Youth)  and
 
participants in the parish's semi-institutionalized dance classes.
 It has fur-
ther correspondences with their activity regarding institutionalized language
 
education.
 Terri Graxumas attends the Saturday classes with her two daughters
 
and her native Birmingham
 husband, Nick, who is on the Holy Trinity-Holy
 
Cross Parish Council.
 They are strong advocates of the Greek School:
 
It was not even publicized at that time [c.1977 when they moved to
 
Birmingham] that there was a Greek School.  We felt it was necessary
 
for the kids to learn Greek.
 We still do.
 It's helped them a great
 
deal at school.
 And they'll continue taking it as long as it's
 
offered.
 No matter how proficient they get, you know.  My husband
 
speaks two other languages and English and, you know, we feel it's
 
very important to speak different languages  (
ES82-Mc/C-C7).
 
Christine Grainmas, a second-generation Greek American and a great-grand-
mother, summarizes these generational changes as they relate to institutional-
ized ethnic education, and to the objectives of the Greek School at Holy Trinity-
Holy Cross:
 
I think it was very rewarding to us to live that way because we can
 
pass it on to our children.
 Of course they're not, we're not as
 
strict with our children as our parents were, and my daughter's not
 
as strict to her children as I, you know, was strict to her .
 .
 
But every generation changes--they're getting a little bit more Ameri-
canized in a way--but still, deep down that Greek is in them.
 You
 
just can't get it out.
 It's just there.
 They love it.
 The only
 
thing is that they just can't speak the language (
tape log ES82-Mc/C-
Cl3)
 
Her sister, Alexandra Bonduris,  agress, and states:
 
1 doubt seriously if  [
the Greek School]  will conti-nue unless they
 
make a change.
 Unless there's a resurgence, I don't know . . . and
 
I hope that it doesn't lose out  (tape log ES82 -Mc/C-C14).
 
Crucial to the success or failure of the Greek School at Holy Trinity-Holy
 
Cross are intra-community differences of opinion over definition of the prob-
lems of institutionalized language education in the parish today, and the best
 
means to resolve them.
 Its future prospects must be assessed both in light of
 
the perceptions of the parishioners, and of the parish priest, as well as in
 
view of recent  (1980)  centralization efforts by the Department of Education of
 
the Greek Orthodox Diocese of North and South America.
 It is, among other
 
things, principally over the issue of the two current Greek School teachers,
 
whom Fr. Vasilakis says he "inherited," that there appears to be some ecclesi-
astical/lay disagreement, reflecting,  as well, the ongoing intra-community ten-
sions between length of U.S. residence, class, educational background, and peda-
gogical approach. 
The two current Greek School teachers interviewed during
 
the course of this project,  and discussed most frequently by our informants--
both the parishioners and the priest himself--are Nichi Jovaras and Themis
 
Kannepoulos,
 both post-World War II first-generation immigrants.
 Jovaras,
 
who came to the U.S.  in the 1950s and to Birmingham in 1980, is a working-class
 
woman, educated only through high school
., but a "
Tiaturai-curn" teacher.

aged children, but seems r
iot to be popular with all of her students or their
 
parents.
 In addition, she has "personal and political differences"[Fr.
-Vasi--
lakis] with the priest.
 Kannepoulos, on the other hand, is highly praised I
 
Vasilakis, principally for his advanced education  (as an engineer), "both 1
1,
 
the U.S. and in Greece," for his "detached political and intellectual approach,"
 
as well as for his emphas-is on the classics.

While the parish priest highlights the crux of the Greek School matter as
 
personality differences and dislike of particular individuals in recent years,
 
his analysis of some of its problems also concurs with those of his parishion-

their children to the school, which is in downtown Birmingham, have already
 
been noted.
 In a recent Parish Council meeting over this problem, Fr. Vasi-
lakis told us that "satellites"--smaller language schools out in the suburban
 
communities--had been considered.
 The problem of the parish's school-aged
 
children's competition and conflicts between their Greek Orthodox friends and
 
those at the American public/parochial has likewise been mention by several
 
parents.
 Father Vasilakis also told us,  "in [my]  layman's opinion," that some
 
of the textbooks are outdated and that the curriculum is seriously lacking, a
 
statement with which we agree.
 The Archdiocese, however, announced in 1980 a
 
long-range plan to centralize and standardize the operation of Greek Schools
 
throughout the U.S., with an eight-year afternoon program of Greek language and
 
cultural study, and a publication schedule for complete Greek language texts to
 
supplement those currently available from the Archdiocese (Papazoglou 1982: 28-
29; Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America Yearbook 1982: 93-94).
 
Problems over teacher training and financing for teachers'  salaries, curricular
 
materials, and student tuition, however, must also be resolved if this national
 
program of institutionalized language education is to be successfully imple-
mented.
 Additionally, the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross parish,  as well as the Arch-
diocese at large, must also address the special needs of converts  (non-Greeks)
 
to orthodoxy as well as those of new immigrants to the United States in develop-
ing Greek School curricula that will serve the varying constituences that now
 
Conklin/McCallum--56
 
comprise most Greek Orthodox parishes in this country.
 Finally, as discussed
 
earlier in this report, the problems of parental commitment and student moti-
vation and attendance must also be overcome.
 Parents of fourth- and fifth-
generation Birmingham Greek Americans must become committed to the idea of
 
Greek School classes for their children, as are the parish's converts and more
 
recent immigrants.

Institutionalized Education: The Lebanese
 
1
�

While it did not split their community into two separate parishes, as
 
at Holy Trinity, the issues surrounding parish education were no less criti-
cal for the Birmingham Lebanese than they were for the city's Greeks. 
While
 
the Greeks argued about control of and most appropriate staffing for their
 
school, the problem at St. Elias has been not how, but whether to conduct
 
ethnic education.
 And the conflict originated not among the parishioners,
 
but between a unified parish and the church hierarchy.
 It seems clear that,
 
had the Maronites been as independent in administrative,  financial, and
 
policy-making matters as are Orthodox congregations, there would now be a
 
Maronite, Lebanese school at St.  Elias.
 The money, the will, and even
 
detailed plans for staffing and curriculum were at hand.
 But the parish was
 
not a quasi - independent congregation like the Orthodox churches. 
It was and
 
is under the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, in which individual
 
parishes are not permitted to make major policy or financial decisions with-
out diocesean permission.
 And, to make matters worse, up until the 1970s
 
Under Fr. Abi-Chedid the parish worked as one for the building funds,
 
first for the church and rectory and then for the school.
 Now, with no plans
 
for further expansion, there are far fewer activities at the church because
 
money-making projects are not necessary.
 Fr. Saad, current priest at St.
 
Elias and priest for the foreseeable future, is not an advocate of the school.
 
The struggle around ethnic education has thus shifted from parish versus
 
Conklin/McCallum--59

never be against them.
 I think they have to be a part of, they
 
are a part of us.
 You can't deny that, but to just exist on that --
the dance and the food and the language--then that is, I think,
 
that's surface.
 
Examined closely over several interviews, his ambivalence appears to be
 
more that the balance will tip away from the internal Maronite faith to exter-
nal cultural manifestations of a non-religious nature, rather than that the
 
association of Maronite with Lebanese is incorrect.
 As a priest, his primary
 
concern is with spiritual affairs and the maintenance of the faith.
 He does
 
not wish to see himself in a dual role as the leader of the ethnic community.
 
No doubt this, too, is partly the response of an urban American as contrasted
 
with an old country village priest.
 Perhaps an additional factor is that this
 
Deep South Lebanese Maronite parish has long been isolated and self-dependent
 
and has different expectations of the roles its priest should assume than
 
might a parish in a more densely Maronite area such as the Northeast.
 In
 
part it is an artifact of American Catholicism's mistaking the Maronite Rite
 
for an ethnic-separatist,
 even schismatic, sect.
 
Saad's parishioners do not attempt to make the delicate distinctions
 
between faith and nationality upon which their priest insists.
 As Elizabeth
 
Boohaker puts it:
 "Well, that sort of goes together, being Maronite and being
 
Lebanese.
 If you're Lebanese you're Maronite.
 Because the Maronite is the
 
majority in Lebanon."  For her,  "Well, the church, really, is the real founda-
tion of the [Lebanese]  community.
 Everyone gathers there.
 If you don't see
 
them at all, you see them at church."  James Mezrano, too, directly connects
 
his religious and cultural life:
 
I love it, I love the music, the food, the dancing  it's all--the
 
religion.
 To me it's a great culture.  .
 .
 We  [
i.e., American Le-
banese generally] keep the food and lose all the others  [
elements
 
of culture]  and we're so fortunate that we have the church and
 
our whole life .
 .
 .
 Right now the church is the center of every-
body's life.
 That's what's holding us all together.
 If we didn't
 
Conk i
jn/McCall um- -
 60
 
have the church we'd be like all the other Lebanese communities.
 
I think we're very fortunate in this area, to have two churches
 
[
i.e., two Lebanese churches, St. Elias and St. George Meikite].
 
For these parishioners, furthering the Maronite cause and Maronite education
 
are identical to furthering Lebanese ethnic awareness and cultural mainten-
ance.
 They are simply not separable.
 
The struggle surrounding the St. Elias school must be understood in
 
this light.
 Saad and his parishioners share deep concerns about the educa-
tion Maronite children receive in the Latin schools and the negative impact
 
Latin school attendance tends to have on the level of participation of fami-
lies in St. Elias.
 They are drawn into work for the school's parish instead
 
and the children make friends among their Latin Rite schoolmates.
 Part of
 
the Latin school curriculum is Catholic liturgy, catechism, and custom.
 
Maronite children learn that this "is" Catholicism.
 
Until Fr. Abi-Chedid started to grant first communion to St. Silas
 
youngsters early--at six instead of seven years of age--the Maronite chil-
dren were even studying for and taking their first communion at schooL  :ii  th
 
Latin Rite with their Latin classmates.
 Because the majority o
 
attend parochial school and thus receive extensive religious instruction in
 
school, the Sunday school hour at St. Elias has been devoted largely to
 
"remedial" education in the principles of Catholicism for those who go to the
 
ubiic school.
 The majority of the children in parochial school do no
 
attend.
 Saad has introduced a quarter-hour specifically on Naronitism
 
the last year or so, based on materials developed in the parish by himself
 
and the teachers.
 This fall, for the first time, there will be Maronite
 
curricular materials from the diocesean education department available for
 
children's religious instruction.
 Starting with these as a supplement to

If this approach, centering more on Maronite Catholicism and making
 
clear the specific ritual, dogma, and history of the church, supplemented
 
with certain cultural activities, is sufficient to Fr. Saad, it certainly is
 
not to the St. Elias school advocates.
 It appears that these latter argue
 
for the school from somewhat differing perspectives.
 
Elizabeth Boohaker, daughter of early immigrants to Birmingham, repre-
ents the old country-oriented faction.
 She and her family are extremely
 
onservative, socially and religiously, as well as ethnically.  Much of her
 
oncern with the Latin schools is that they are no longer strict enough with
 
he children.
 She feels that the liberalization of liturgy, lifestyles of
 
:r1 sts and nuns, and approach to social issues in the Latin church have been
 
very cad mistakes.
 Of the Latin nuns she would hope to retain as teachers
 
in a St. Elias school,  for example, she says:
 
But these nuns are still real nuns.
 They are full habits.
 And
 
And that's what we want.  We don't want these nuns who look like
 
me and you and they call themselves nun.
 They're no more nun
 
than I am.
 
She criticizes Saad for having married people at St. Elias who have been
 
divorced and general lack of strictness  (
e.g., permitting women to attend
 
mass with bare heads and arms), although among the American Maronite priests
 
he is "one of the better ones."
 In her own extended family any niece or
 
nephew who marries "outside the faith," i. e., any non-Lebanese and non-
Maronite or -Melkite, is excluded from all family functions.
 Bringing a
 
non-Lebanese Catholic spouse into St. Elias does not make restitution.
 The
 
Boohakers draw  a parallel between excommunication from the family and excom-
munication from the church:
 
They knew at the time they did that that they would lose their
 
privileges of unity to the family .
 .
 .
 What bothers me is thEy
 
knew they were doing wrong.
 It's not wrong to marry somebody
 
like that.
 But we're trying to keep our heritage together.
 
Conklin/McCallum-- 63

The Boohakers are so adamant and conservative that they have chosen to with-
draw their active support from almost all parish activities, because of what
 
they see as religious liberalizations and because of the school.
 They
 
think the church is now "mainly social," not religious.
 This family has
 
been central to all fundraising activities in the past, but "I told them,
 
'You want our family back here, you going to have to start that school going,
 
because the church doesn't need anything else "
 
While James Mezrano very strongly shares Boohaker's concern over the
 
integrity of the family and abhors out-marriage, he comes to his support of
 
the school in a somewhat different fashion.
 A mid-thirties third-generation
 
American, he has no strong ties to the old country.  Whereas Boohaker has
 
two nephews who will return to Lebanon to marry village girls this summer,
 
Mezrano, his family, even his parents have never visited there.
 He is not
 
trying to maintain traditional Lebanese ways in the United States, but to
 
create a sense of place and self for his Lebanese American family.
 He
 
inherited not an intact culture, but a fragmentary one.  While others in his
 
age group opted for assimilation as an escape from "foreignness," he has
 
overcome the ethnic, minority child experience by integrating and promoting
 
his Lebanese heritage.
 He speaks of the privileges he had in Birmingham in
 
comparison to his wife, who grew up Lebanese in a Mississippi town with no
 
ethnic or ethno-religious institutions.
 For Mezrano, the St. Elias school
 
is a means of passing on to his children a fuller cultural experience and
 
sense of place.
 He wants them to have what he did not.
 He describes him-
self:
 
I
'm not that old country and I
'm not that modern.
 But I think we
 
should know who we are, and about our background, and to be proud
 
of it .
 .
 .
 A lot of people my age wish we could speak it  [Arabic],
 
and that's how come we want the school.
 You know, there are a lot
 
Conklin/McCallum ­ 64
 
of young married couples, with children .
1.
.
 We'd just have a
 
fit to have a school down there .
 .
 .
 I would just love for my
 
kids to go to their own church, to their own school, and to par-
ticipate and be around their heritage more and be around their
 
own people more.
 
It is not so much reaction or resistance to external social change that moti-
vates Mezrano, but a positive affirmation of an immigrant experience and cul-
tural heritage.
 
Interestingly, it is Mezrano who is most emphatic about Arabic language
 
retention (
or renewal).
 Boohaker was raised in an Arabic-speaking home and
 
some of her nieces and nephews do speak it.
 However, her brothers' homes are
 
basically English-speaking; the new Boohaker Lebanese brides are multilingual,
 
not their Lebanese American grooms.  Mezrano, essentially a monolingual, tries
 
to use in daily conversation at home all the Arabic words and phrases he still
 
remembers.  Boohaker mentioned many innovations at St. Elias which distressed
 
her but the increasing use of English in the liturgy was not one.  Mezrano,
 
on the other hand, wants to see the entire mass returned to Arabic.
 Because
 
he completely identifies Maronitism with Lebanese heritage, he would eradicate
 
all Westernisms, not just Americanisms.
 
At St. Elias today 95% of the mass is said in English.
 The Holy Conse-
cration is recited in Aramaic and the choir sings "a couple of hymns"  [Saad]
 
in Arabic.
 This is a radical shift from 1940, when Abi-Chedid was coached by
 
Josephine Sharbel so that he could recite his first reading of the gospel in
 
English--he memorized the sounds, not understanding a single word.
 Sharbel
 
is a professional musician and has transcribed numerous Arabic hymns into
 
phonetics for the use of monolingual choir members.
 Prayer bo
 
gual texts and a phonetic rendering of the Arabic, so that par:
 
read along.
 Saad thinks  the switch to Enqf sh is a good move:
 
S
 
Conklin/McCallum-- 65
 
S
 
S
 
S
 
I
'm satisfied with just keeping the flavor of it .
 .
 .
 Aramaic is
 
more important [than Arabic] because it was the liturgical language.
 
Like Latin, it was preserved just for the liturgy and Aramaic was
 
closer to our people because they spoke it at one time.  And also
 
Christ spoke Aramaic.
 So I think there will always be a closeness
 
to that, to that language, because of those associations
 
You know, I have a flavor, a flavor for it too and I can read Syriac,
 
cause that's how we're trained .
 .
 .
 my idea was that if the rite
 
was going to thrive, people had to know what they're doing, espe-
cially the young.
 I think these things are, can be transmitted
 
with a flavor, but in English.
 What they never knew what it was
 
before.
 And the thing about these churches--the Maronite and the
 
Melkite churches--this old way of thinking was that they were old
 
country churches, you know
, for the old people or those who didn't
 
speak English.
 I think we've had to change that if there was going
 
to be any hope for the young people to come.
 To understand what
 
they were doing .
 .
 .
 And it's successful; it can't help but be
 
successful if you approach it like that.
 We have more young com-
ing to our church now than ever before.
 
Saad articulates quite eloquently the linguistic-assimilationist position.
 
Yet he speaks often of this notion of "flavor."  It arises in his description
 
of the Arabic language classes.
 Although he maintains that the language-
learning efforts are largely fruitless in terms of actual linguistic skills,
 
he thinks it is good for parishioners to have the experience of studying the
 
alphabet, and learning a bit about the language.
 He especially approves of
 
their learning vocabulary sets such as greetings, things around the house,
 
foods--"you know, table-talk kind of stuff"--since it puts them in touch with
 
the culture they make in their homes.
 
I don't think it is really going to mean a lot.
 Except to give
 
you a flavor of the identity, which is all right .
 .
 .
 Now there's
 
more than an awareness and a real desire for identity .
 .
 .
 [
It
 
would not be good if] you didn't know what to call the foods your
 
grandfathers ate, you know, and that you eat every Sunday.
 And
 
you know, they're pretty good, you know, there's nothing else
 
like them.
 
Saad, and later Saad and Joseph Koury both, mention the Arabic kinship
 
terms as a specific example of how exposure to the old country language
 
helps the people conceive of their own culture.
 As a child Saad marvelled
 
Conklin/McCallum-- 66
 
at the wealth of kin terms that enabled his parents to denote all members
 
of the family in a single word expression of relationship;
 "I don't know
 
them all myself, but it's fantastic."
 "There's no way" that this concept
 
of the extended family can be expressed adequately in English.
 
Mezrano is confident that the young people in the
 -
 
effective bilinguals and this is one of the outcomes he
 
the school.
 He notes that his five-year old son can recite the non-English
 
sections of the mass already.
 
Left to me, the whole mass could be in Arabic, I feel like we have
 
a prayer book, we can read it, and then we can learn the words in
 
Arabic also.
 You repeat it so m
a
n
y
 times and you hear it and can
 
pick it up.
 
He would send preschoolers to Arabic classes, before they ever started to
 
the regular day school.
 
Although Fr. Saad says that:
 
I don't think we would ever, I would ever build a school.
 I would
 
never want to run a school, cause the Catholic church has gotten
 
out of that I think, and in the place tried to develop good educa-
tional program, good catechistics in the parish .
 .
 .
 No, I think
 
t
±aà k it's fairly resolved now.
 I mean, I say there is still talk
 
about it, yeah, but. I think everyone knows where I stand.
 
he admits that "Now, there's, we have a lot of children now, coming up, and
 
there's more talk, ah, from some."  And there certainly is lots of talk.
 
There is as yet no official committee to organize for the school, but James
 
Mezranc was recently elected to a seat on the Church Council and Elizabeth
 
Boohaker--much to her suprise  (
"Somehow,  I don't know how, cause I
'm on the
 
outs")--as an alternate.
 She says:
 
I think that they're, our church has become sort of a faction thing.
 
Some want it, some don't want it, you know.  And there aren't enough.
 
in there in support of it.
 Of course now that they have to make all
 
these big payments for education [
out-of-parish tuitions to Latin
 
schools] that they make, they've started thinking over again what
 
it could be .
 .
 .
 We talk about it everywhere we go.
 We propagate

a school.
 Cause that's the only way you're going to preserve
 
your parish.
 
Mezrano concludes:
 
I would give anything if they would open it up.
 If Fr. Richard
 
would think the way some of us thinks.
 But he doesn't .
 .
 .
 I
 
don't know.
 I hope we get a school.
 I really feel that if we
 
don't that we'll lose it all.

schools
The Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Greek School and the St.  Elias Arabic School
 
are the most public and formalized expressions of cultural transmission under-
taken by their communities.
 Although they are community-based and quasi-insti-
tutionalized, they rest upon educational traditions which are integrated into
 
the ordinary lives of the Birmingham Greek and Lebanese communities.
 It is
 
the everyday, home and community casual and informal learning which the 
 
are to supplement.
 Parish and community organizations represent a middle
 
ground between institutionalized education and unself-conscious enculturation
 
of children by family and community.
 Planned and casual community social
 
events are one and two steps further removed from explicit teaching/learning
 
situations in the language school setting.
 Even in family life, the element
 
of self-conscious teaching of cultural heritage is often very strong.
 Many
 
of the activities, and sometimes the actual physical environments of Birming-
ham Greek and Lebanese homes are calculated demonstrations of ethnic culture.
 
Using this situational model, we attempt to characterize ethnic heritage
 
and language education that takes f

dialogue between two Greek informants, Georgia Kampakis and Maude Morgan,
 
illustrates their view of community education.
 The Greeks, they say, are:
 
Morgan: 
.
 .
 .
 very traditional people, who, ah, church, religion,
 
and family traditions carried out in the different ages--
I mean in coming to America--and how we've continued what
 
we've inherited here.
 I think that's one of the main rea-
sons  [
for cultural retention] ,
 because our family tradi-
tions are so intertwined with our religious traditions--
even though within our church we have holy traditions,
 
which is altogether different from family traditions--
and sometimes people mistake our family traditions for
 
holy traditions.
 
Kampakis: 
I think it begins with the family, really.
 And then from
 
there it sort of branches out to the Greek School and
 
then the church, and organizations and things like this.
 
But it all begins with the parents, with the mother and
 
the father.
 It did with us.
 
S
 
Morgan: 
I think now it kind of works more through organizations
 
a little more than it did in our first years  [
as a com-
munity].
 And when I was a little girl, of course, the
 
Greek School was very important.
 
Both women express an inseparable relation between the various settings in
 
which community life and learning take place.
 For Morgan, the religious and
 
secular cultures are "intertwined."  Kampakis sees the activities of home,
 
Greek school, and parish organizations as "branches" of the same effort.
 
Interestingly, Morgan notes that, while the components remain the same as
 
in her girlhood, the emphasis has shift :.
 
burden now; the Greek School less.
 The
 
the aspects of culture that are most imperative are somewhat different as t
 
community becomes not  immigrant Greeks,  but a culture of Americans of Greek
 
descent.
 The following examples of community cultural activities and family-
based learning illustrate continuity and change in cultural transmission.
 
They suggest direct effects on the importance, structure, and content of the
 
ethnic schools as the communities evolve.
 
Community cultural activities. 
The high points of the Creek and Lebanese year
 
are ethno-religious holidays that occasion the most intensive experience of all
 
Conklin/McCallum--70
 
aspects of ethnic culture.
 It is during the high holidays such as Easter and
 
saints' days, that the mother tongue is employed most extensively in the
 
liturgy; mother tongue hymns, prayers, and secular songs are revived; a host
 
of expressions relating to the festivals are used by members otherwise mono-
lingual.
 The holidays bring forth feasts of ethnic food, native costumes,
 
banks of flowers, home decorations and ritual objects  (
e.g., the Greek Easter
 
eggs; the Catholic and Orthodox Lenten palms; the Epiphany holy water for the
 
Greek home altars).
 Special rituals are performed, both in the church and
 
within extended families and social networks.
 
These holidays are celebrations and simultaneously intragroup exhibitions
 
of ethnic culture.
 Our informants report the intense level of activity pre-
ceding the important holidays.  Women cook and prepare the family home and
 
decorate the church.
 Greek men set up the lamb pits; Lebanese men prepare
 
their backyard grilling areas.
 The choir rehearses.
 Children finalize their
 
dance routines and pageant lines and dress.
 Non-Greek informants who have
 
married into the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross community comment that it is in par-
ticipating in these preparations that they became familiar with the Greek
 
Orthodox customs.
 
Both the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities also put on more public
 
ethno-cultural events.
 The annual Greek Bazaar attracts participants from the
 
entire Birmingham area.
 Last year 7,000 meals were served and uncountable
 
pastries sold.
 Young people are trained to lead tours of the cathedral, for
 
which they must memorize the Greek terms for all the parts of the building and
 
furnishings.  While this event is calculated to raise money for th
 
and to introduce the Greek community to greater Birmingham, it is
 
tant expression of the Greek community's external ethnic customs, as well as
 
Conk lin/McCalluni--- 71
 
the women's organization that works three days a weeks for six months to pre-
pare all the food for the Bazaar:
 
I think that is one way we keep the Greek customs alive, through
 
that, even though we don't like to admit that people kind of know
 
us for our food .
 .
 .
 Why fight it anymore?  It's really something
 
to be proud of.  And our customs, our dances, too, because our chil-
dren always do dances .
 .
 .
 They [non-Greeks] tell us that they like
 
to come because it's a family-oriented festival.
 And it really is,
 
the kids are all working, the grandmothers, the mothers, some grand-
fathers that are there, fathers, everybody.
 It's a community project
 
really, but it's sponsored by the ladies' group  (
tape log ES82-Mc/C-
C8).
 
S
 
The centrality of intact family and community life is made visible to outsiders,
 
which in turn reaffirms the community's sense of ethnic integrity.
 
For the Lebanese, the weekly public dinners of the 1930s-70s served a
 
similar purpose.
 They put money the building-fund coffers, created an ethno-
cultural activity in which parish members could become highly involved, pre-
sented a wholesome view of Lebanese life to the external world, and reinforced
 
the value of their culture to the community itself.  Birmingham's Lebanese
 
also maintain a private social club, the Cedars Club, where organizations hold
 
meetings, Lebanese young people and adults swim and play tennis, and a vari
 
of activities, more or less ethnically-related, take place.
 We visited th
 
Cedars Club during their weekly bingo luncheon.
 It is open to the public
 
at least 300 people of all ages--mostly women, some Lebanese, and many non-
Lebanese--played bingo and consumed a lunch of Lebanese meat pies, tabouli
 
salad, Lebanese spice cookies, and coffee and iced tea.
 The Women's Auxiliary
 
of the Cedars Club prepared the lunch and hosted the affair.
 
Greek and Lebanese community members also participate in a variety of
 
casual and social activities that are culturally-related.
 There are dance
 
clubs at Holy Trinity-Holy Cross and both Greeks and Lebanese regularly enjoy
 
ethnic music and dance at weddings, festivals, and private parties.
 Until
 
recently there was a Greek music balid of young Holy Trinity-Holy Cross boys
 
,j
j
ilo played for all sorts of events.
 The St. Elias parishioners hire Arabic
 
musicians from New York or elsewhere for major parish events, sometimes even
 
for weddings.
 One of the Greek Orthodox men's organizations sponsored a tour
 
to New Orleans this summer to see the travelling art exhibit "In Search of
 
Alexander."
 Last year a women's group visited the first Greek School in the
 
United States in St. Augustine, Florida.
 The parish is participating in a
 
national fund-raising drive to restore the school building to its original
 
state and to erect a memorial chapel.  (
See photos of activities, Appendix D.)
 
All these sorts of quasi-organized activities reinforce the cultural heri-
tage that these ethnic communities wish to maintain and transmit.
 They form
 
the background to the interest in Greek and Arabic school courses and indicate
 
a continuing curiousity about and awareness of their ethnic heritage.

 Several informants utilize mother tongue proverbs, relate stories from
 
the old country, from the early days in the United States,  from Greek/Arabic

 Sharbel's living room is decorated with paintings and photos of
 
family members, small knick-knacks distinctly Arabic in design, and oriental
 
rugs.
 She and Boohaker wear heavy gold jewelry, especially hoop bracelets.
 
Boohaker's home contains oriental rugs, Lebanese lace tablecloths, photos of
 
Lebanon and family in Birmingham and in Zahie.
 In her basement is a special
 
cooker for Lebanese bread; in the backyard a permanently installed triple
 
gas-fueled grill.
 Every surface and every wall in the Jovaras home displays
 
Greek artifacts.
 They range from replicas of ancient vases to postcards of
 
costumed Greek dancers, to Aegean seascapes rendered in oil, to homeland
 
ary.
 The walls are blue and even the furniture is upholstered in the Gree
 
national colors.
 The apartments of Christine Grammas and Alexandra Bondur
 
are similarly repositories for family and Greek memorabilia.
 Every home we
 
visited had a large photo album of trips to the old country conveniently at
 
hand, and quickly brought forth for our examination.  (
See photos of homes and
 
artifacts, Appendix D.)
 
All of these practices reflect conscious statements of ethnic identity,
 
and strategies for its maintenance.
 In the more middle-class homes the objects
 
Conk iin/McCaJ lurn-- 74
 
are carefully chosen, artistic artifacts of old country high culture, based
 
on that class aesthetic.
 In the more working-class homes, fine art and crafts
 
are intermixed with mass-produced replicas designed for tourist consumutiori.
 
Lookin9 beyond them to less external fo ns of ethnic expression,  it is criti-
cal to analyze ways of "being" Greek of Lebanese, not just exhibiting Greek--
ness or Lebaneseness.
 
One facet of deeper cultural identity is home language use.
 First, what
 
language is used in the home?  In all the homes we visited--save Fr. Saad's
 
rectory a
 semi-public space--Greek or Arabic was in regular use, at least an
 
ters.  Boohaker and Sharbel both use Arabic with family and friends of the.
 
generation, but increasingly make use of English with the younger generation,
 
practically to the exclusion of the ethnic mother tongue.
 
Beyond simple language choice, we were aware of conversational strategies
 
that were derived from the mother tongue culture.
 The Jovaras', like other
 
Greeks we interviewed at the cathedral, tended to speak rapidly, respond
 
quickly to queries, and to interrupt and overlap each other and--to a lesser
 
extent--the fieldworkers.
 There are scattered remarks about the contentious
 
"nature" of the Greeks, e.g.,  "Everybody wanted to be chiefs .
 .
 .
 That's the
 
trouble with the Greeks"  [
Christine Gramluas]; "there will always be a lot of
 
conflict [
Terri Grammas];  "if the Greeks don't have an enemy outside to fight,
 
they just fight with each other"  [C. W. Jovaras].
 The somewhat loud, quick,
 
and assertive style of discourse we encountered indicates that Greek-language
 
conversational norms unconsciously pervade the community's English as well.
 
By contrast, our talks with Lebanese Americans were far slower in pace.
 
There were long pauses between our questions and their responses.

seemed to be careful and deliberate, often clarified with illustrative example
 
stories.
 There were few interruptions, either of us or--in the single dialogue
 
we recorded, of Fr. Saad and Joseph Koury--  of  each other.  While we are not
 
familiar with the discourse styles typical of Lebanese Arabic conversations,
 
the differences from our cn Anglo-English were pronounced enough to elicit
 
immediate comparisons between ourselves of the Lebanese's sense of timing and
 
deliberation.
 
Perhaps the clearest indicator of family life as an expression of cul-
turally-appropriate behavior and of cultural values is the extreme hospital;
,-.
-
with which we were met in these two communities.
 Fr. Vasilakis took it upo
 
himself to carefully question us about the nature and goals of the researci
 
project (
it was he who requested a written description of the project)  and he
 
selected the interviewees based on our initial interview.  Much to our sur-
prise his secretary called one day and informed us that a series of interviews
 
had been arranged and we were to come to Holy Trinity-Holy Cross, where the
 
parish members would report to meet with us.
 Thus our Greek interviews were
 
clearly conducted under the auspices of the parish priest; the interviewees
 
were prompt, interested, and open.
 Subsequently the Jovaras' took it upon
 
themselves to introduce us to "real" Greek life by inviting us to their home
 
for an evening of food, music, and conversation.
 The sisters Grammas/Bonduris
 
asked us to their homes for lunch and conversation, so that they could share
 
their photo albums, Greek artifacts, and hospitality.
 
In the Lebanese homes we were plied with ethnic specialties--even in the
 
rectory, where we talked around Fr. Saad's kitchen table, passing by the for-
mal reception areas.
 Our most serious interview problem was bringing the meet-
ings to an end.
 Fr. Saad, the most apparently de-ethnicized of our Lebanese
 
Conklin/McCallum--76
 
informants, concluded our interview by remarking that while "I don't like  [
St.
 
Elias]  to be called an ethnic community," and while he does not favor a parish
 
school, he does see certain aspects of Lebanese life as part of Maritonism and
 
intrinsic to parish life:
 
Well, the way of life, and the feeling that we have for each other,
 
and the hospitality.
 There's always been Lebanese hospitality.
 
Always been.
 Always proud of that.
 And family life.

Attitudes towa
 
sense of pride in their long literary traditions, and both value "the learn
 
man," as teacher and leader.
 Nicholas Lambrinides, the most admired Greek
 
teacher, and Fr. Abi-chedid of St. Elias are characterized by this term.
 The
 
Lebanese describe themselves as direct descendants of the Phoenicians and the
 
great Arabic cultures preceding Turkish domination.
 The Greeks look back to
 
the classical Hellenistic tradition.
 
These traditions have implications for language and ethnic school curric-
ula and pedagogy, and also for the imperative many in the communities feel
 
toward cultural preservation and transmission.
 Elizabeth Boohaker explains why
 
the St. Elias parish was united behind Fr. Abi-Chedid's plan for a Maronite
 
parochial school:
 
They were very interested in helping the pastor get the school
 
started because that's the only way you're going to preserve any-
thing.
 You'll preserve your heritage and teach your children who
 
they are.
 And of course, we have the proudest heritage there is.
 
We started civilization.  We started Learning.  We started navigation.
 
We started accounting.
 Just name it and it was started by the Phoenicians.
 
While our Lebanese informants all felt the need to allude to their ethnicity's
 
contributions to world culture with at least some brief remark, the Greeks were
 
more self-assured that their Hellenic culture is well-known and respected, at
 
Least by educated Americans such as the fieldworkers.
 The Greeks'  remarks
 
were intended to show how the classical culture taught as a scholarly subject
 
matter in America is part of everyday life for Greeks  (
e.g., as a child, C. w.
 
,Jovaras'  bedtime stories were the Greek myths).
 
However, the Greeks, too, have been grossly misunderstood by their fellow
 
Southerners. 
Fr. Vasilakis reported that he recently attended an ecumenical
 
Christian ministers'  conference, where he was dressed in his black clerical
 
suit with white clerical collar.
 On the third day of the meeting another con-
feree responded to one of Vasilakis'  observations by asking,  "You mean you're
 
The Birmingham Greeks and Lebanese have had to long struggle not only
 
against ignorance, but against overt racism.
 In the segregated South Greeks
 
and Lebanese were considered non-white.
 Our interviews contain frequent refer-
ences to discrimination in employment, housing,  and the schools.
 Here are some
 
representative remarks on the early years:
 
In the South, there weren't too many ethnic groups.
 The oniy--Italians,
 
Greeks, very few Greeks, very few Italians, and the Jewish people.
 And
 
we were looked down, in fact they called us "dagos" in those days
 
[
group laughter].
 They did!
 They called the Italians and the Greeks
 
"dagos."  And everybody would murmur if they wanted to speak to some-
body in their native tongue, they would go secretly to speak so they
 
won't be ridiculed  (Christine Grammas).
 
[Greeks were]  looked down on  [as]  foreigners . . . We had the monied
 
people who settled Birmingham, then we had the foreign people.
 And
 
they looked on them more or less in the same classification as blacks

Alexandra Bonduris exolains that the discrimination eased after World War II:
 
It made a lot of our American boys aware, especially here in the
 
South, because we have a lot of what you would call "redneck" people
 
that didn't know anything beyond their own little area .
 .
 .
 and
 
when they were exposed to the farmlands of Italy, England, Italy,
 
Belgium, and so forth and so on, they realized, "Hey, this is what I
 
do.
 These are people, too."
 I think it exposed them to a lot
 
But Maude Morgan, although she prefers to think things are far better now, still
 
sees vestiges of the effects in her son:
 
[The Greek community at first tried to maintain its own, separate
 
culture and education because]  I think at first it was because of
 
this anti-immigrant.
 I felt this way when I was in grammar school.
 
And I think the War (World War II]  changed everything .
 .
 .
 Now let
 
me say this.
 You know C. J., my younger son, because of the preju-
dices and because--it seemed at a certain time, even after the war,
 
that high school children of different nationalities were not heli
 
into getting into, ah, not better positions, and to hold office i
r
 
some of the clubs, and these areas in the high school life.
 And,
 
they were discriminated against.
 Not the Greek people only.
 But,
 
like I said before, the different groups.  And he would always say
 
when they'd ask him, or he'd say to me, "I'm an American."  Or if
 
anybody asked him he'd say, "Well, I
'm an American.  My mother was
 
born in America."  You know, he was kind of defensive.
 
James Mezrano attributes his aggressive stance toward ethnic heritage and lan-
guage education to discrimination he and his wife suffered as children and which
 
he does not want to have his children damaged by:
 
And I
'm sure they [
his wife's family] had a rough time in Mississippi
 
growing up [apart from an organized Lebanese community]  .
 .
 .
 I know
 
my mother and father did, in this area .
 .
 .
 I think they got so
 
tired of defending having people not understand  [
that they give up
 
their language/culture]--me I consider it ignorance if they do not
 
understand.
 I just feel like they should look at their own back-
ground.
 You know, who are they to judge me? .
 .
 .
 And that's what I
 
tell my children.
 And I tell them if anyone calls you anything bad--
and I tell them what the words are that I think are bad--you have my
 
permission to pick up a brick and hit them.
 I don't like violence,
 
but they do [
have permission].
 And we're in 1982 now and those days
 
are gone, you know, where you have to defend your religion and your
 
heritage and your background.

In 1911 Dr. Elkourie testified before the United States Congress on
 
behalf of immigrants from Greece and Lebanon.
 These two nations had
 
given Western Civilization the beginnings of its culture, he said,
 
and it would be a terrible irony for America, the West's most civi -
lized nation, to refuse Greeks and Lebanese a home because they could
 
not read Enqlish. 
"You owe it to them for no other reason but that
 
of paying a debt."
 
The Birmingham experience strongly contrasts with Naff's  (
1965: 132)
 
description of Lehanese Christian immigrant's experience nationally:
 
Conklin/McCallum--82
 
•
 .
 the Syrians had relatively smooth relations with other Ameri-
cans.
 Hostility toward them was neither specific nor sustained and
 
Syrians were only dimly aware of it.
 
While Naff no doubt overstates the case--immigrants from the Mediterranean area
 
to all parts of the United States can recall instances of discrimination and
 
anti-foreign sentiment--it seems clear that the Birmingham situation was extreme.
 
Up until the 1960s when the Civil Rights Movement brought a de jure end to
 
segregation, dark complexioned Greeks and Lebanese might have been challenged
 
when using "white only" services or facilities.
 Ku Klux Klan and other racist
 
activists continue to use the narrow definitions of "white" Americans that
 
include these peoples among their targets.  And the stereotype of a monolithic
 
black/white South has yet to be overcome, both within the region and nationally.
 
There is little public consciousness of the variety of peoples who make up the
 
American South outside of the particular locales where European ethnics, Asians,
 
or native Americans are settled.
 
According to our findings, the Birmingham Greek and Lebanese communities
 
have been remarkably culturally retentive and continue to express strong ethnic
 
identity.
 Ethnic in-migrants to the Birmingham communities have observed this
 
as well and, like us, believe that this may be due in part to the unusual social
 
and cultural context in which they make their hom es:
 
I think  [
an important reason] was this community being isolated, from
 
the other Greek communities.
 Because when you go into the Carolinas,
 
Virginia, start moving up north, you can go five miles and meet another
 
Greek community, ten or fifteen miles, you're in another Greek commu-
nity.
 So you're not an isolated portion.
 You're really not isolated
 
in those areas.
 Here in Birmingham it's very isolated. And I can see
 
that within the people, becoming more clannish, I guess, and it's
 
because of the isolation.
 And because of your different groups.
 I
 
think that in other communities that were not isolated, I think it
 
became a lot more cosmopolitan, and also more social, and not so much
 
clannish (
C. W. Jovaras, tape log ES82-Mc/C-C12).
 
I think the Birmingham community has always been very aware of itself.
 
I really believe that.
 And I
've heard compliments about them, nation-
ally, you know, throughout my time as a priest .
 .
 .
 They've always
 
Conk liri/McCallum--83
 
stayed close to their traditions and their identity and their church.
 
Haven't gone too far away and had to pull them back, I mean, they
 
know, they have had that awareness.
 And I think that's due to the
 
churches which promote that and to the  [
Cedars]  Club  (
Fr. Saad, tape
 
log ES82-Mc/C-Cl).
 
These Birmingham cases raise intriguing and important questions about the pro-
cess of assimilation/acculturation and the struggle to maintain ethnic identity
 
under conditions of isolation in an inhospitable, sometimes hostile environ-
ment.
 Further study of ethnic heritage and language education, and studies of
 
ethnic maintenance and cultural tranmission in general, should be broadened
 
and deepened by examination of the Southern experience, rural as well as urban.

RECOMMENDATIONS
 
Our fieldwork among the Greeks and Lebanese has been very exciting and
 
informative, yet leaves us feeling that we have just begun to scratch the sur-
face of two extremely interesting histories and experiences.
 The mother tongue
 
schools at Holy Trinity-Holy Cross and St. Elias have led rather marginal exis-
tences for the past few years; there seems to be no reason to believe that they
 
will not continue at least their present level of activity for some time to
 
come.
 Their present status, when viewed in light of their more than 70 year
 
histories, may make them not less, but more interesting for the stated pur-
poses of this research project.
 
While they are not ideal sites for comparative analysis of contemporary
 
teaching methods or curricular materials--the staffs are largely untrained
 
and volunteer; the materials are mostly ad hoc--the very issues and struggles
 
which have surrounded them can tell us a great deal about cultural values
 
and educational attitudes in their respective communities.
 The issues are
 
alive and actively discussed.
 Both proponents  and opponents are informed,
 
analytic, and articulate.
 
Further work in these communities would benefit from expansion and refine-
ment in several directions:
 
1
.
 Broader-cased research objectives, which would place classroom
 
education in the context of related cultural training and main-
tenance activities.
 
2.
 An approach more informed by related research in other disci-
plines, particularly with regard to research methodologies a
 
perspectives which can account for evolution in both the scP
 
and attitudes toward education as the communities change ov,
 
time.
 
3
.  A longer, more flexible timeline, in order to accomodate the
 
schedules of ethnic community classes and cultural events and
 
to permit thoughtful analysis of the data before report writing.
 
Conklin/McCallum--s5
 
We would like to evaluate our experience in Birmingham in the light of these
 
three recommendations and suggest directions for future research in the com-
munities we have studied.
 
Objectives. 
In the section "Other Forms of Education," above, we have sug-
gested some of the ways in which our informants described their own concept
 
of ethnic education.
 In these communities, where the ethnic mother tongue is
 
no longer learned by the children as a native language, language study is,
 
for most, not separable from the other efforts to continue ethnic culture.
 
Rather it is--barring outxnarriage--the single most difficult component in
 
maintenance of cultural integrity, because of the enormous effort required
 
for second language learning.
 These informants seemed to focus their atten-
tion on language teaching for just that reason:
 it serves as an index of
 
individual and collective will to keep their heritage alive.
 
Even self-consciously ethnic community members rang along a continuum
 
with respect to the intensity with which they feel the need to practice cul-
tural transmission.  For some religious practice is most critical.
 For oth-
ers active participation in ethnic foodways, dance, and music are an additional
 
required component.
 For still others, identity is not whole without at least
 
some familiarity with, and perhaps use of, the ethnic mother tongue.
 
Some of these components of ethnic identity lend themselves to teaching
 
on an institutionalized basis.
 This is especially true of language.
 Others
 
can be learned and reinforced in less formal ways--in the home  (
e.g., cook-
ing), or in casual or directed community activities  (
e.g., spontaneous danc-
ing at social events or in semi-organized dance clubs).
 Thus formal and
 
informal education cannot be ranked as more and less serious or important.
 
Their intents--even their intensities--may be the same with the method deter-
Conklin/'McCallum ­  86
 
mined by the nature of the content.

JnJIC
 tonon them the Greek or Arabic language, so they look to the par-
oh for this service.
 
In  order to study the scope and effectiveness of institutionalized eth-
ic education, we must first know what institutionalized education is intended
 
L
enent.  This will enable us to understand the choice of content and
 
o
trictjro of ethnic schools and communities'  attitudes toward education, as
 
to the care-
and thoughtful analysis with which other forms of cultural expression have
 
.
.en approached.  Whereas folklorists are very much alive to all the forms and
 
vels of cultural transmission, most linguistic analysis has been unidimen-
onal:
 a community practices language maintenance if its young people grow
 
up bilingual and it does not if they become monolingual in the mainstream
 
tongue.
 Language, however, should be seen as are other components of culture--
an elusive, complex, and sometimes partial phenomenon, expressed in both direct
 
and indirect ways.
 
In conventional sociolinguistic terms, the Birmingham Greeks and Lebanese
 
have "failed" to retain their mother tongues, since few of the young are
 
actively bilingual.
 Likewise the L
-
Ioiy Trinity-Holy Cross and St. Elias lan-
guage schools are "failures," because their students clearly do not become
 
fluent or even passibly competent with so limited an exposure.
 Yet the
 
courses do provide the "flavor"  (
to quote Fr. Saad) of the ethnic mother
 
tongue.
 This seems highly desirable to many and sufficient to some community
 
members.
 Even limited exposure appears to offer a sense of identity with the
 S
 
Conklin/McCallum--  3
7
 
mother tongue and its culture, and stands--for the communities--as an expres-
ion of their seriousness with regard to cultural integrity.
 
because language maintenance is easily computed in simple arithmetical
 
rms of numbers of speakers, it too often serves as an index of cultural
 
tention, when in fact a far more complicated analysis is required.
 Lan-
age is just one, not the central form of ethnic cultural expression, but
 
has been used as the primary indicator by linguists, anthropologists, and
 
community members alike.
 Language retention is a complex phenomenon and must
 
be analyzed in the context of  a  variety of social and cultural factors,
 
such as those suggested in the table below.
 
Nor should the issue of language maintenance be posed as a yes-no ques-
tion.
 Rather, it too is a complex of factors and must be answered through
 
the analysis of what, why, and how, with which other forms of cultural expres-
sion are evaluated.  What elements of their language does a community choose
 
to preserve or to study in the classroom?  In the home?  Why do these elements
 
satisfy the need for linguistic identity and understanding of the mother
 
tongue culture?  And then--finally--how are they taught?
 
Interdisciplinary study. Although we could only do a rather quick review of
 
the vast literature on ethnicity in the United States, it became clear that
 
the research required a more complex definition of ethnic maintenance and
 
identity than suggested in the brief project guidelines, if we were to under-
stand the history and current attitudes of the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross and
 
St. Elias communities.
 In particular, a situational approach based on viable,
 
current definitions of "assimilation," "acculturation," and integration" would
 
strengthen the conceptualization of the project.

of assimilation in different aspects of culture, as developed by anthropolo-

churches, clubs, theatres, presses, broadcasts
 
religious and/or cultural ceremonies requiring
 
command of the mother tongue
 
e
thnic i
dentity strongly tied to language;
 
nationalistic aspirations as a l
anguage group
 
emotional attachment t
o mother t
ongue as a de-
fining characteristic of ethnicity, of self
 
emphasis on family ties and position in kin-
ship or community network
 
emphasis on education, if in mother tongue or
 
c
ommunity-controled schools, or used to en-
hance awareness of ethnic heritage; low em-
phasis on education otherwise
 
culture unlike Anglo society
 
LINGUISTIC FACTORS:
 
standard, written variety as mother tongue
 
use of Latin alphabet in mother tongue, mak-
ing reproduction inexpensive and second
 
l
anguage l
iteracy relatively easy
 
mother t
ongue with international status
 
literacy in mother tongue, used for exchange
 
within the community and with homeland
 
some t
olerance for loan words, if they lead to
 
f
lexibility of the language in i
ts new setting
 
lack of mother t
ongue institutions, from disinterest
 
or lack of resources
 
ceremonial life institutionalized in another tongue
 
or not requiring active use of mother tongue
 
ethnic identity defined by factors other than language,
 
as for those from multilingual countries or language
 
groups spanning several nations;  low level of nationalism
 
ethnic identity, sense of self derived f

actors such
 
as religion, custom, race rather than speech
 
low emphasis on family or community ties, high emphasis
 
on individual achievement

gists in Africa and as articulated with respect to U.S. immigration by
 
Sengstock (
1974), and of the evolution of ethnicity, ethnic identity, and
 
practice, as proposed in Faires  (1981), would contribute significantly to
 
our analysis of cultural maintenance and language retention, and especially
 
to changing community attitudes toward them.
 
In addition to interviews with informants and observation of classrooms
 
with study of curricular materials, the project could be deepened by use of
 
archival and social historical research methodologies.
 If we are able to
 
continue our work, we would like to look at the churches'  records  (
e.g., the
 
legal documents relating to the split between Holy Trinity and Holy Cross and
 
the lawsuit against St. Elias; the minutes of critical parish meetings where
 
educational policy was decided) ,
 reports in local newspapers and other regional
 
and national ethnic papers available in area archives  (
e.g., the University of
 
Alabama, Birmingham Public Library), and follow up on the connections between
 
these and other parishes of their denominations, especially in the Southeast
.
 
region.  We also lack detailed information on settlement:  ports of entry,
 
routes to Alabama, census and immigration and naturalization data, early travel
 
to and from the old country, marit
 
and marriage trends in the commun

time of immigration, generation in the United States, class identity, occup,
 
tion, level and forms of education (public/parochial), home language retention,
 
religious conservatism/liberalism, political activism with regard to the old
 
country, personal and family ties to the old country, to national ethnic net-
works, to the local community.
 To evaluate these and related issues adequately

would require more background information on community development and more
 
extensive interviews with a broader, more representative sample.
 
The possibilities for linguistic analysis of these communities has only
 
been hinted at in the comments on our data.
 There are interesting questions
 
of dialects spoken by the immigrant families and the standard of speech taught
 
in the schools, narrative and conversational styles which may be related to
 
ethnic mother tongue structures ,  and widely varying usage of American English
 
within and among the speakers.
 Study along the lines suggested by Tannen
 
(
1982) might well prove very fruitful in the analysis of cultural retention
 
in less obvious language behavior patterns.
 
Project structure. The short duration of the project was a severe problem for
 
US.
 Most obviously--because of the parishes'  language school calendars and
 
the late start-up date of the project--it prohibited our visiting actual
 
language class sessions.  We were not able to follow up with interviews with
 
a number of informants whom we had contacted and who would have provided a
 
fuller picture of the evolution of the schools.
 In particular, there are
 
large gaps in our ±
iformation about the Greek schools.
 Prospective informants
 
include young people who attended the classes held in the 1970s, younger
 
adults who were enrolled in the 1960s, and several middle-aged people who
 
attend d HcL': TrinitY.

Holy Trinity-Holy Cross and St. Elias, because the principle holidays fall
 
outside the research period.
 Even during our brief period of interviewing
 
we developed sufficient rapport with our informants that we were invited to
 
public and private gatherings.
 The fieldwork phase was so short, however,
 
that we could not participate in many of them.
 
colLkliri/McCajIum-- 92
 
The time between the final fieldwork and submission of the report was
 
filled, not with thoughtful reflection on our findings, hut the scramble to
 
copy and log tapes, photos, slides, and organize our documentation.
 We would
 
have preferred to have had the leisure to put more careful thinking into this
 
report and to have conducted a more thorough study of the secondary literature
 
and related local documents before trying to evaluate our data.
 The period of
 
just one month between the submission of this report and the seminar seems
 
brief.  We still have a lot of thinking to do.
 
In general, our findings substatiate the hypotheses set out in the project
 
guidelines.
 Our suggestions here serve as refinements of those guidelines,
 
based on this initial research.
 We wish to strongly urge the continuation of
 
the project, on a longer-term and more broadly conceived basis.
 By understand-
ing the "fit" between school structures, content, and pedagogies, and the cul-
tures which create them, and by studying schools in relation to other culturally
 
retentive community and family activities, we will come to understand the
 
woridview which communities share and are attempting to transmit.
 This project
 
has the potential to go far beyond a simple survey of the success and failure
 
of ethnic heritage and language education efforts, to perceive the complex
 
and dynamic cultural values articulated through the e
thnic educational  rocess.

each  day.
 Both  the  students and  the  teacher were  bi 1

Engli sh  and used  the  two  languages  in  cl ass.
 The  cl asses were  to make  the

In  the  summer  of  1982  the  interning seminari an  is a Lebanese-Omer
 
who does not meet  the mini mum Arabic  speaking and reading skill s
 
gui delines establi shed by  the  bi shop.
 To expose  hi s  intern  to  the
 
language  and renew Arabic  teaching at  the  school,  the  pari sh  priest
 
arranged  that  an  immi grant  Lebanese who  is a professi onal  elementary
 
teacher  offer  a chil dren's cl ass.
 Unlike most  of  the  post-1965
 
immi grants,  her  famil y  is hi ghl y  language  retenti ve,  -
a fact  that  the
 
priest  attri butes  to  their  pl ans  to return  to Lebanon.
 Thi s woman,  who
 
teaches her  own  daughter Arabic  at  home,  agreed  to  take  on  other  chil dren
 
in  the  six  to  ten  age  group.
 An  announcement  in  the  Sunday bulletin  drew
 
chil dren  and al so a number  of  adul ts.
 An  additi onal  teacher was  then
 
found  from  among  the  recent  immi grants,  and a
n
 adult  cl ass has al so be gun .
 
Both  c
l asses meet  for  just  one  hour  each week  duri n g  the  Sunday
 
i
\
j2
' chool  peri od between  earl y and  late mass.
 Thi s  t
i me  is usuall y devoted
 
to reli gi ous  instructi on.
 The  chil dren's cl ass now has just  over  ten
 
chil dren.
 The  teacher  is  introducing  the  alphabet,  readi ng and writing,
 
counting,  and rhymes for word memorizati on
 using photocopies of

.
 She  assi gns homework  task
 
Of  rewritin g, copying,  and  transl ating,  which  the  pupil s have  completed
 
d
ili gentl y.
 The  seve
 i ht  adults  in  the  other  cl ass requested
 
conversati onal  Arabic.
 Their  t
i me  is
...de- 4ed to speaking,  not  reading and
 
writing 1 with  the  excepti on  of  learning  the  characters associ ated with  the
 
sounds which  have  no parallel  in  Engi i
 sh.
 Pract ical  conversati onal
 
phrases seem  to be  the main  emphasi s.
 Thi s  appears  to he  the  i
irst  cour se
 
at  St.  El i
 as foll owing a conversati on  approach.
 Sc  far  the  at tendance  has
 
been  good and enthusi asm hi gh.
 Most  of  the  adult  students have minor
 
passive  knowledge  of Arabic,  but  cannot  speak  it.
 The  pari sh  priest
 
expects  the  cl asses  to go on  into  the  fall,  if  interest  continues at  the
 
present' level.
 The  adults had hoped for  a longer  sessi on  or  a weekday
 
evening cl ass,  but  their  teacher was not  avail abl e  except  on  Sunda -.
,-

mornings.
 If  the  adult  cl asses continue,  they may  have  to be  scheduled
 
for  another  t
i me.

Now,  with  no pl ans for  further  expansi on  of  the  school,  the  church,  or  th
 
rectory,  there  are  far  fewer  activities at  the  church,  because
 
money-making projects are  not  as necessary.
 
The  pari sh  priest  argues

that  the  idea of  a school  at
 
St.  Eli as runs counter  to  the American  Catholic  Church's general  movement
 
away from parochi al  educati on,  brought  about,  in  part,  by  the  loss of nuns
 
and  the  hi gh  cost  of  lay  teachers.

 No  doubt  thi s
 too,  is partl y  the  response  of  an

far  removed from
 
the  viJl age  leader  role  of

 Yet
/St.  El ias  is a Lebanese
 
Maronite  pari sh  in  the  Deep  South,  long  isol ated  and self  dependent;  its
 
congregati on may have  broader  expectati ons of  the  roles  its priest  shoul d

 As one  put

If  you're  Lebanese  you're Maronite.
 Because  the Maronite  is  the majority

 And,  -

For  these pari shi oners,  maintaining  the Maronite  faith  and Maronite
 
reli gi ous educati on are  identical  with maintaining Lebanese  ethnic  and
 
cultural  awareness
  
f?it
they are  s
i mpl y 
separable.
 
The struggle surrounding  the  St.  E
l  as  school  must  be  ur
iderstcc
'd  i
n
 
l
i ght  of  the above senti ments.
 The  priest  and h
i s pari shicr
ierE
.  share  deep
 
concerns about  the educati on Maronite chil dren receive  i
n  the  Latin
 
school s and the  effects that  Latin  school  attendance  appears  to have  cr
 
the  level  of participati on  at  St.  E
l ia
 families are  drawn  to do
 
volunteer work  for  the  school's pari sh  instead of  their  own,  and  the
 
chil dren make  friends among  their Latin  R
ite school mates.
 In  addition,
 
part of  the Latin  school  curriculum  is Catholic  l
iturgy,  catechi sm,  and
 
custom,  and Maronite chil dren  learn  that  this  is  the  universal
 
Catholici sm.
 Until  Father Abi —Chedid started  to grant  f
irst  communi on  to
 
St.  E
li as youngsters earl y -
-
 at s
ix  instead of seven  years of  age  -
-
 the
 
\__d
 -
,
 
Maronite chil dren were even  studying for  and  taking  their communi on at
 
school  i
n  the Latin R
ite with  their Latin cl assmates.
 
Because  the majority of  the chil dren attend parochi al  school  and thus
 
receive extensive religious  instructi on during  the week,  the Sunday
 chool
 
hour at St.  E
l iás has been  devoted largely  to "remedi al"  educati on  in  the
 
principles of  Catholicism for  the minority who go  to  the  public  school
 
Most  parochi al  school  chil dren do not  even attend.
 The  priest has
 
i
ntroduced a quarter hour specificall y on Maroniti sm  i
n  the  last  year  or
 
so,  based on materials that  he  and pari sh  teachers have devel oped.
 In
 
fall" 1982,  for  the  f
irst  t
i me,  there will  be Maronite curriculum materi al s

 While
 
others  in  hi s age  group  opted for  assi mil ati on  as an  escape  from
 
"forei gn-ness,"  he  has overcome  the  ethnic,  minori ty - chil d experience  by
 
integrating and promoting hi s Lebanese  heritage.
 He  speaks of  the

who grew up  Lebanese  in  a Mi ssi ssippi  town with  no ethnic  or

about Arabic  language  retenti on  or  renewal.
 The  el ders  in  the  first

homes,  too,  will  be  Engli sh  speaking.
 In  contrast,  the  adults  in  the
 
second famil y,  without  ol d country  t
ies and essenti all y monolingual  in
 
Engli sh,  try  to use  the  few Arabic words and phrases  they still  remember
-
in  dail y conversati on  at  home.
 While many  innovati ons at  St.  Eli as
 
di stressed  the  -
first  Lebanese-oriented famil y,  they di d not menti on  the
 
increasing use  of  Engli sh  in  the  l
iturgy.
 The  latter  famil y,  on  the  other
 
hand,  wants  to see  the  entire mass returned  to Arabic.
 
At  St.  El ias  today ninety - five  percent  of  the  mass  is  in  Engli sh.
 
The  Hol y Consecrati on  is recited  in Aramaic  and  the  choir  sings  "a c

 Thi s  is a radical  shift  from  1940,  when  Father

 One  pari shi oner who speaks Arabi':  ar
id  is  a  professi onal  musici an 1
 
has
 merous Arabic  hymns  into phonetics for  the  use  o1
 
monolingual  choi r members.
 Prayer  books have  bili ngual  texts and a
 
phonetic  rendering of  the Arabic,  so  that  pari shi oners can  read al ong.
 In
 
the  pari sh  pri est' s view  the  switch  to Engli sh  has been  positive  for  the
 
congregati on:
 
I
' m sati sfi ed with  just  keeping  the  fl avor  of  it.
 
Aramaic  is more  important  [than Arabic],  because  it was  the
 
l
iturgical  language.
 Like  Latin,  it was preserved just  for
 
the  l
iturgy.
 And Aramaic was cl oser  to our  people,  because
 
they spoke  it  at  one  t
i me.
 And al so,  Chri st  spoke Aramaic.
 
So  I thi nk  there will  al ways be  a cl oseness  to  that
 
language,  because  of  those  associ ati ons.

 You
 
know,  I have  a fl avor,  a fl avor  for  it
oo,  and  I can  read
 
Syri ac  'cause  that's how we're  traine &(
 .
 My  idea
 
was  that,  if  the  rite was going  to  thrive,  people  had  to
 
know what  they're  doing,  especi all y  the  young.
 I think
 
these  thi ngs are,  can  be,  transmitted with  a fl avor,  but  in
 
Engli s
2(hat  they never  knew,  what  it was before.
 And
 
the  thing about  these  churches ---  the Maroni te  and  the
 
L
L-
Melkite  churches,  thi s ol d way of  thinking --  was  that  they
 
were  ol d—country churches,  you  know,  for  the  ol d people,  or
 
those who di dn't  speak  Engl ish.
 I think we've  had  to
 
change  that,  if  there was going  to be  any hope  for  the
 
young peopl e  to come,  to understand
�hat  they were  going

 Yet  the  priest  speaks often  of  thi s noti on  of  "fl avor.'
 It
 
ari ses  in  hi s descripti on  of  the Arabic  language  cl asses.
 Although  he
 
maintains  that  the  language  learning efforts are  largel y fruitless  in
 
terms of  actual  l
ingui stic  skill s,  he  thinks  it  is good for  pari ahicrer
 
to have  the  exper ience  of  studying  the  alphabet  and  learning a bit  about
 
the  language.
 He  especi all y approves of  their  learning vocabul ar:

I don't  think  it  is reall y going  to mean  a lot,  except  to
 
give  you  a fl avor  of  the  identity,  which  is all  ri ght.
 
Now  there's more  than  an  awareness and a real  desire
 
for  identi ty.
 
[It woul d not  be  good  if]  you  d

The  priest  and hi s  intern,  both  Lebanese-Americans,  cite  the Arabic
 
kinship  terms as  a specific  example  of  how exposure  to  the  ol d-country
 
language  helps  the  people  conceive  of  and  internalize  their  own  cultural

Although  not  directl y cited by any of  our American-born  respondents,
 
part  of  the  problem during  thi s peri od appears  to have  been  staffing
 
di fficulties.
 In  the  late  1960s  the  one  teacher  at  the  Hol y Tri nity-Hol y
 
Cross Greek  School  was an  el derl y woman  from Greece whose  teaching style
 
was not well  received by her  students,  accustomed  to  the ways of
 
American  school s.
 One  student  called her  a "stri ct  di scipline  cl assic
 
Greek  schoolteacher"  in  the  ol d country fashi on.
 She was foll owed  in  the
 
earl y  to mi d -19 7 0s by an  immi grant  from Cyprus.
 A current  teacher
 
1 ersel
 an  immi grant  Greek'  descri bes hi s pedagogical  methods:
 
He was not  for  chil dren.
 He  [shoul d have]  taught  adults.
 
He was reall y  tough  on  the  chil dren,  you  know.
 He
 
thought  he was back  in  Greece,  in  the  ol d school  in  Greece,
 
and chil dren woul d resent  it.
 .
 .
 Well,  I'll  tell  you
 
how  it  started.
 There was  these  three  l
ittl e  girl s"
- -
-
intermarri age,  you  know
--
so  they were  going  to  thi s Greek
 
chool.  Well,  one  day he made  a mi stake.
 In  Greek  [he
 
sai d],  "Look  at  all  these American  ki ds come  to Greek
 
chool . "
 Well  naturall
.
 .
 .
 they di dn't want  to go
 
back.
 And  [my daughter]  says,  "If  they're  not  going  to go,
 
then  I'm not  going  to go."
 So  I sai d,  "If  you're  going  to
 
sit  at  home,  then  I'm going  to  teach  you."  .
 .
 And  the
 
i
 ttl e girl s say,
 "
t4e1 1
 ,
 can we  come  too?"
 And  I say,
 
"Yeah."
 And  that was good,  because  that was one  t
i me  [my
 
daughter]  reall y  learned her  Greek  because,  see,  the  four
 
o+ them together , I had  them  two daxs a week , and I

and  the  coupl e' s  two daughters.

coming of age  in  the early  1950s.
 Thi s generati on,  now the mainstay of
 
the  congre
 t
i on,  was better educated as a group  than  i
ts parents,  and  is
 
so':i all
 pwardl y mobile.
 During  the post-war years  there was
 
l
ittle or no new  immi grati on  from Greece  into the  Orthodox community  in
 
B
irmingham.  Greek  Orthodox spouses came  i
nto  the  Birmingham community from
 
e
l sewhere  i
n  the  country.
 Non-ethnicall y Greek wives a
lso converted to
 
the  Greek Orthodox  faith during  thi s t
i me  and joined  i
n  local  community
 
activities.
 Greek-American communities all  across  the country were
 
undergoing t -
p
od of homogenizati on  and assi mil ati on  i
nto  the
 
American mainstream.
 These  third-generati on  immi grants,  and  their peers
 
by extra-community and  i
nterfaith marri age,  appear  to be  the  least
 
ethnically retentive and most  ethnicall y ambivalent  of  the Greeks studied
 
in Birmingham.
 They have been  h
i ghl y selective about  the elements of
 
their ethnic heritage  they choose  to preserve,  have  felt  the most  guilt
 
about  their passivity  i
n  transmitting  their  heritage  to their  chil dren,
 
and have rejected many of  the  traditi ons  their parents saw as essential
 
components of  their  own ethnic educati on,  both  at  home and  in more
 
i
nstitutionalized and public  settings.
 Not  surpri singly,  however,  it  is
 
thi s group  that  has been most  active  in public di spl ay events  l
ike  the
 
annual  Greek Festival, which exhibits  external  ethnic customs such as
 
foodways,  dance,  music,  and drama, to the  public  at  large.
 T

HER F RMS OF ETHNIC EDUCATION AT ST

The  St.  El i
 as Arabic  School  and  the  Hol y Trini ty-Hol y Cross Greek
 
School  are  the most  public  and formalized expressi ons of  cul tural
 
transmi ssi on  undertaken  by  their  communi ties.
 Al though  they are  commun
 
based and quasi - instituti onali zed.,  they rest  upon  educati onal  traditi ons
 
which  are  integrated  into  the  ordinary  l
ives of
 
I
'
 
( Birming ham Lebane=
.e 
and Greek  communities.
 The  school s are  a supplement  to  the  informal
 
learning  that  takes pl ace  in  the  home  and communi ty  on  a dail y basis.
 
Pari sh  and community organizati ons represent  a mi ddle  ground between
 
instituti onali zed  educati on  and unselfconsci ous enculturati on  of  chil dren
 
by famil y and community.
 Pl anned and casual  community soci al  events  are
 
one  and  two steps further  removed from explicit -
t eaching/learni ng
 
situati ons  in  the  language  school  setting.
 A-&"at  the  least  formal  le d
 
even  in  famil y  1

 A
 
heritage  is very strong.
 Many of  the  activities,  and someti me -
s the
 ctu
 
physical  envi ronments of  Birmi ngham greek  and Lebanese  homes,
 
calcul ated demonstrati ons of  ethnic  culture.
 
The  foll owi ng di al ogue  between  two Greek  respondents  i
llustrates
 
common  view of  community educati on.
 The  Greeks,  they say are:
 
A:
 Very  traditi onal  people,  who  [ have 3L
 
church,
 
Conklin & McCallum,  p.
 
reli gi on,  and famil y  traditi ons  [that  are]  carried out  in
 
the  di fferen t age s.
 I th i
 r
ik  that  
"s one  of  the  main  reasons
 
N or  Greek  cultural  retenti on],  because  our  famil y
 
traditi ons are  so  intertwined with  our  reli gi ous  traditi ons A
 
—
ver
i  though,  within  our  church,  we  have  hol y  traditi ons,
 
which  is al together  different  from -
famil y  traditi ons,  and
 
someti mes people mi stake  our  -
famil y  traditi ons for  hol y
 
tr aditi ons .

 I thi nk  it  begins with  the  famil y,  reall y.
 And  then
 
from  there  it  sort  of  branches out  to  the  Greek 1
11choo1
 and
 
then  the  church  and organizati ons/ and  things  l
ike  thi s.
 
But  it  all  begins with  the  parents4 with  the mother  and  the
 
-
father.
 It  di d with  us.
 
A:
 I thi nk  now  it  kind of works more  through  organizati on
 
a l
ittle more  than  it  di d  in  our  -
f
irst  years  [as
 
community].
 And when  I was a 1
 i
 ttle  girl,  of  course,  t e
 
Greek

(-
Both women  experi ence  an  inseparable  rel ati onshi p  between  the  v
a r i
o u s
 
settings  in whi ch  community  l
ife  and  learning  take  pl ace.
 The  rel igi ous
 
and secul ar  cul tures are  "
intertwined."
 The  acti vities of  home,  Greek
 
Z
hool,  and pari sh  organizati ons are  seen  as  "branches"  of  the  sam e
 
effort.
 While  the  components remain  the  same  as  in  their  chil dhoods,  the
 
-
 
emphasi s has shi fted -
-
 the  soci al  organizati ons bear more  of  the  burden
 
'—I
 
now , he  Greek pchool  less.
 The  learning continuum  is unaltered,  but  the
 
aspects of  culture  that  are most  important  change  as  a community o
 
immi grant  Greeks  becomes a community of Americans  of  Greek  descent.

really  is --

the mothers,  some grandfathers that  are  there,  fathers,
 
everybody.
 It's a community project reall y,  but  i
t's
 
sponsored by  the  ladies'  group.    
 
The  central i
 ty of  famil y and community  l
ife  is made  v
i si ble  to outsiders,
 
which  i
n  turn reaffirms the community's sense of  ethnic  i
ntegrity.
 
For  the Lebanese  the weekl y public  d
inners which  took p
l ace from the
 
1930s  through  the  1978s served a s
i mil ar  purpose.
 They put money  i
n  the
 
buil ding-fund coffers,  created an ethno-cultural  activity  i
n which pari sh
 
members coul d become h
i ghl y  involved,  presented a wholesome view of
 
Lebanese  l
ife  to  the external  worl d,  and rein-
forced  the  value  of  the
 
culture  for  the  community  itself.
 B
irmingham's Lebanese a
l so maintain a
 
private social  club,  the Cedars C
lub, where organizati ons hol d meetings,
 
Lebanese young people and adults swi m and pl ay  tenni s,  and a variety of
 
more  or  less ethnicall y rel ated activities  take pl ace.
 We vi sited the

hospi tal i
 ty with which we were met  i
n  these  two communities.
 The  Greek
:
 
Orthodox priest  took  i
t upon  h
i mself  to carefully question  us about  the
 
nature  and goal s of  the research project,  select ing  those we woul d
 
i
nterview based on  our  i
niti al  i
nterview with  hi m.
 H
i s secretary called
 
one  day and  informed us that  a series of  interviews had been  arranged and
 
we were  to come  to Holy Trinity-Holy Cross,  where  the  pari sh members woul d
 
report  to meet with us.
 Thus our Greek  i
nterviews were  c
learl y conducted
 
under
-  the  auspices of  the pari sh priest.
 The  interviewees were  prompt ,
 
i
nterested,  and open.
 Subsequently some  interviewees  took  it u
p
o
n
 
themselves  to  introduce us  to
 "real"  Greek  li
fe  by  invi ti n g  u s  to  their
 
homes for  food,  music,  and conversati on,  so  that  they coul d share  their
 
photo a
lbums,  artifacts,  and stories
d demonstrate Greek hospitality.
 
Our f
irst  and pri mary contact at  St.  E

l so the  pari sh
 
:riest,  but he  si mpl y provi ded names of  potenti al  contacts.

ncluded  those who di sagree most  strorgl>
 
.h-hi m on  the  issue of opening an a
l 1-day school
.
 In  the Lebanese
 
homes,  too, we were p
lied with  ethnic speci alties.
 Our most  seri ous
 
i
nterview problem was bringing  the meetings  to an  end.
 The  pari sh priest,
 
ever  careful  in  di stingui shing faith from culture,  concluded one  interview
 
by remarking  that,  while he does not  l
ike  St.  Eli as  to be  thought  of  as an
 
ethnic community,  he does see  certain aspects of  Lebanese  l
ife  as part of
 
Maroni t
i sm and  intrinsic  to pari sh  l
ife.
 "Well
,
 the way of  l

feeling  that we  have for each  other,  and  the  hospi tal i

 They were persecuted.
 And they d
i dn't  know the

 . [The  St.
 
E
li as community remained strongly committed  to each other
 
because]  well
,
 I think  in  the northern  c
ities  there was not
 
that much  di scriminati on.
 
See,  people  here were even
 
afrai d to say  they were Catholic at  one  t

 Down South,
 
you know,  that  is a Bapti st country.
 If you  sai d you were
 
Catholic,  why you got  it.
 
My father had to go  to court one  t

 W

 He  sai d.  "Well,  let me  tell

worry about  it.
 I ain't  putting away no cross.

 Sure  enou gh,  he won  the  case. 75  
R':i al  di scri mi nati on  eased after Worl d War  II:
 
It made  a lot  of  our American  boys aware,  especi all y  here
 
in the  South,  because we  have  a lot  of what  you woul d call
 
"redneck"  people  th t  di dn't  know anything beyond  thei r own
 
i
 ttle  area.
 .
 .
 And when  they were  exposed  to  the
 
-farml ands of  Ital y,  Engl and,  Bel gium,  and so  -
forth  and so
 
on,  they  realized,  "Hey,  thi s  is what  I do.
 These  are
 
people ,
 
too
. "
 
I think  it exposed  them  to a lot .
 
But  vesti ges remain:
 
[The  Greek  community at  first  tried  to maintain  its own
 
separate  culture  and educati on  because]  I thi nk  at  first  i
t
 
was because  of  thi s anti -i mmi grant.
 I felt  thi s way when  I
 
was  in  grammar  school.
 And  I think  the war  [Worl d War  II]
 
changed everything.
 
Now  let me  say  thi s.
 
You
 
know my younger  son,  because  of  the  prejudices  and because
 
it  seemed at  a certain  t

today  the  communi ties endure  insults grounded  in  ignorance  and,  from some
 
e
lements,  conti nued resentment.
 It  is  in  thi s adverse  context  that  the

The  Birmingham Greek  and Lebanese  communities have  been  remarkabl y
 
culturall y retentive  and continue  to express strong ethnic  identity
 
despite  their  small  numbers.
 Immi grants  to  the  Birmi ngham communiti es
 
have  observed  thi s  as well  and,  l
ike  us,  believe  that  thi s may  be  due  i
n
 
part  to  the  unusual  soci al  and cultural  context  in which  they make  their
 
home s : ,
 
/
 
I think  Can  important  reason]  was  thi s community being
 
isol ated from  the  other  Greek  communi ties.
 Because when
 
you  go  into  the  Carolinas,  Virgini a,  start moving up North,
 
you  can  go  fi ve m
i les and meet  another  Greek  community,  ten
 
or  fifteen miles,  you're  i
n  another  Greek  communit y.  So
 
you're  not  an  isol ated person.
 You're  reall y  not  isol ated
 
i
n  those  areas.
 Here  in  Birmingham  it's very  isol ated.

CONCLUSION
 
Brief  fiel dwork  on  ethni p- +
guage  and heritage  school s
 n these  two
 
pari shes clearl y  suggests  that-A
U
 of  community - based educati on  offers a
 
valuable  perspective  on  cultural  maintenance  and adaptati on.
 By anal yzing
 
the  "fit"  between  school  organizati ons,  content,  and pedagogies and  the
 
cultures of  the  communities which  create  them,  and,  especi all y,  through
 
study of  communi ty-based school s  in  rel ati on  to other
 
culturall y - supportive  community and famil y activiti es,  we  can  come  to
 
understand  the worl
view  that  a communi ty shares and  is attempting  to
 
transmit.

History of St. Elias Maronite Catholic Church
 
To understand  the impediments to ethnic maintenance facing Maronite
 
immigrants, i
t  is necessary to consider the relationship between the Maronite
 
faith and Lebanese nationality. Maronites are the majority Christians and
 
leaders  in Lebanon today,  and Maronite Catholicism is,  for all practical-
purposes,  the official religion. The identification of "Maronite" with
 
"Lebanese" was tenuous at  the turn of the century,  however —during the period
 
of massive immigration —and remains problematic for the church.
 
_
_
_ 
contempo r a ry

To make matters more difficult,  the American Catholic Church regarded the
 
Maronites —whether "Syrian" or "Lebanese" —as just another ethnic group to
 
a
ssimilate into the "universal" Latin Rite. The Latin b
ishops directly thwarted
 
Maronite efforts to create autonomous churches and schools. They also
 
discouraged them from practicing their rituals in the
 
s
tyle and the
 
Aramaic/Syriac and Arabic languages.  I
t was not until the second Vatican
 
Council i
n 1
965 tiar  acknowledging the integrity of the Eastern Rites became a
 
policy o
f the Roman church. Catholics are now instructed to follow the rite of
 
I
[tir fathers when a p
arish of that r
ite exists.
 
Thus the Lebanese Maronites found themselves in something o
t a douDLe
 
On the one hand, they needed to respond affirmatively with a clear,
 
tionally_based sense of ethnicity,  if they were to withstand assimilation
 
into the American mainstream. On the other, they had to convince the American
 
Catholic Church that their demands for separate institutions were based not on
 
national, but on doctrinal differences.
 
In St. Elias today the debate continues. The priest identifies himself not
 
as a Lebanese but as a Maronite Catholic. His parishioners see the Maronite
 
Church as the institutional core of their ethnic community, however. These
 
distinctions are important determinants of the practice of ethnic—heritage and
 
Arabic language education in the parish.
 
The Lebanese community in Birmingham was established in the years
 
following 1
890. Settlement continued until the i
imni
 
1
924. Most Lebanese migrated first to cities in the
 
and thence t
o Alabama. The founding Lebanese families in Birmingham originit
 
3
 
in the farming villages in the area around Zahie in central Lebanon. They were
 
attracted t
o Alabama by opportunities to enter into itinerant trade among rural
 
residents or in urban areas amidst the growing numbers of mining, steel, and
 
iron workers. They did not often choose farming or even industrial wage labor
 
because they intended to return to the old country. Also the tenant farmer and
 
sharecropping agricultural system prevalent in this region was antithetical to
 
their experience and ambitions as independent small farmers. Most Lebanese
 
immigrants became peddlars, traveling the back roads carrying notions, dry
 
goods, and hand-crafted i
tems on their backs. The profit was high, the
 
investment low, and only minimal English was necessary. A route and a stock
 
could be obtained from more established Lebanese who owned shops and organized
 
routes for newcomers. As they became permanent settlers they often moved from
 
peddling into shopkeeping and wholesale grocery and produce businesses.
 
By 1
915 sixty-five Lebanese families were settled in Birmingham and had
 
established a Maronite Catholic
 
urch with an Arabic school in the afternoons.
 
St. Elias was founded in 1
910 in a converted public school building at 20th
 
Street and Sixth Avenue South. It is named after the church in
 
Wadi- 
el-Arayeche,  the home village of many Birmingham families. Until the 1960s
 
St. Elias was one of only two Maronite churches in the Southeast.
 
St. Elias was established under the authority of the
 
who supplied the parish with a series of priests from Lebanon. Once
 
established, however,  i
t became a responsibility of the Latin Rite Diocese in
 
all other matters, and held  inancial obligations to the bishop and to the
 
Latin parochial schools.

t does not appear t
o have been a
s high a

e

ongregations nationally I V
 t
 
remained I  its original, 
s
ettled away from the c
hurch area into the neighborhoods o
f Glen Iris and
 
Idlewild on the southwest s
ide of Birmingham. Finally, the church closed in
 
1
939 for l
ack of a priest; appeals t
o the patriarchate went unanswered f
or over
 
s
ix months. The community then contacted a priest directly who happened to be
 
visiting his brother in Detroit and later obtained permission f
or Father Joseph
 
Ferris Abi-Chedid to come t
o Birmingham rather than return to his monastery in
 
S
t. Elias. The only remaining functioning church organization was the Ladies'
 
Altar Society, which raised $
311 to add t
o the church t
reasury o
f $
7.87 so
 
that Father Abi-Chedid could reopen the building and begin calling the
 
Maronites t
ogether again. He quickly l
earned sufficient English t
o r
ead the
 
gospel and t
o comm u nicate
 
c
ommunity. He then set about obtaining property in the Lebanese neighborhood
 
and managed t
o have almost a full city block of land donated to the parish.
 
In 1
949 consfruction b

buildings was paid for in cash raised primarily through the Ladies' Altar
 
Society weekly Lebanese dinners, which became a veritable institution for many
 
Birmingham r
esidents.
 
The church had a series of short-term resident priests after Father
 
Abi-Chedid. In 1972 the present priest, Father Richard Saad, was appointed to
 
St. Elias. Father Saad, a member of one of the first classes to graduate from
 
the American Maronite Seminary in Washington, D.C., i
s the first American-born
 
priest a
t St. Elias. Although of Lebanese descent, he i
s also the first priest
 
not to speak Arabic fluently. Since 1972 Father Saad has concentrated his
 
efforts on consolidating the parish membership, reaching out to Maronites who
 
have turned to the Latin Rite, and restoring the teaching and celebration of
 
the Maronite Rites. He has also begun converting one classroom into a
 
library--one of only two or three such Maronite libraries in the United
 
States--with the help of the Ladies' Altar Society.
 
St. Elias now has 260 active families, totaling 800-1,000 people, most of
 
whom are of Lebanese descent. These numbers reflect the post-1965 immigration
 
of educated, professional people, displaced by recent conflicts in the Middle
 
East. It i

The parish organized the first Arabic language classes in 1
915, just five
 
years after its fdunding. During the early years Khattar Wehby, one of the few
 
well-educated immigrants, conducted them. At first the classes t
ook place in a
 
section of the old church and later at another location. Webby taught as a
 
volunteer, giving classes after school for several hours each day. Both the
 
students and the teacher were bilingual in Arabic and English amd used the two
 
7
 
languages in  class. The c
lasses were t
o make the children literate i
n Arabic,
 
familiarize them with Arabic/Lebanese literature, and supplement the cultural
 
e
ducation t
hey were r
eceiving in Latin parochial schools.
 
The classes were not successful for very long. Wehby perservered,
 
starting classes each fall until the 1
920s, but the consistent attrition
 
discouraged him. Josephine Wehby Sharbel describes her father's teaching
 
efforts as follows:
 
He didn't receive cooperation. And, you know,  he didn't
 
want anything from them. He'd say,  "Give me your children.
 
I don't want anything, just let me teach them." .
 .
 .
 Well,
 
i
t just wasn't supported, I mean,  in that they didn't
 
cooperate with Papa. Maybe the parents, you know, kind of
 
just drifted away. And then my father just got disgusted
 
and l
i
e just quit.  (ES82-Mc/C-C3)
 
As t
extbooks Wehby u
sed grammars, dictionaries, histories, and  poetry and
 
essay volumes that he had brought with him from Lebanon. Although
 
trained in classical Arabic, he taught the vernacular language.  "We learned the
 
alphabet. We learned to read, to spell. We learned poetry and songs," says his
 
daughter. Except for the songs,  the efforts were c
iirected toward r
efining the
 
children's language skills. She also recalls that the instruction was:
 
t
1ore or less,  1 would say,  conversational .
 .
 .
 and the
 
spelling and things like that, but barely writing.  '
Cause
 
I don't think we ever got to the point where we were doing
 
too much writing, specially not the print. I think we were
 
printing more or l
ess.  (ES82-Mc/C-C3)
 
Elizabeth Boohaker and her brothers also attended the Wehby classes for
 
Arabic-speaking children. She r
eports a s
imilar experience.

language,  ah, print. Now, script,  I can't read, but I can
 
r
ead print.  ES 2-Mc/C-C4)
 
The next serious efforts at language education did not take place until
 
Father Joseph Abi-Chedid became priest of St. Elias in 1940. He came to
 
Birmingham intending to open a full-day Maronite parochial school. Elizabeth
 
Boohaker recalls r
iis arrival:
 
The people were r
i
ungry for a new church. In fact, be didn't
 
want to build a new church first; he wanted to open a
 
school first. He says--which i
s true--"without the school
 
you have no parish." The children are going to disperse,
 
they're going t
o go to other places, they're going to l
earn
 
other cultures, and you just won't have, won't have your
 
parish.  (ES82-Mc/C-C4)
 
But the school building was not immediately forthcoming, so Father  bi-Chedid
 
introduced Arabic classes for the young people after school and on Saturdays.
 
James Mezrano was one of his pupils.
 
He tried to teach u
s Arabic, but h
is bedside manners were
 
very rough and the children were very scared of him. We'd
 
just shake. He was just very s
tern and strict, and, I don't
 
know, we just couldn't learn from him.  (ES82-Mc/C-C16)
 
Father Abi-Chedid's students were no longer Arabic-speaking or b
ilingual
 
in Arabic and English;  they were second- and third-generation Birmingham
 
Lebanese, with, at best, passive knowledge of the language. Mezrano describes
 
his own skills as typical: he can understand a considerable amount, but he
 
cannot r
espond nor can he r
ead or write Arabic.  "Even t
hough t
hey [
his
 
9
 
generations's parentsj Knew Arabic, and we were spoken to by them in Arabic,
 
and I understood i
t, we were never taught to speak i
t fluently," he explains.
 
(
ES82-Mc/C-C16)
 
Father Abi-Chedid emphasized conversation, pronunciation-drill (
in some cases,
 
physically trying to force laryngeals out of his pupils),  and the alphabet. The
 
classes would s
tart up again and again and s
top b
ecause the children dropped
 
out after a month or so. "I guess that's why I know the alphabet so well,"
 
says Mezrano,  "we went through i
t so many t
imes." (ES82-hc/C-C16) Although
 
these experiences were not promising, Father Abi-Chedid did not waver from his
 
determination to have a school at St. Elias t
o supplement the Latin parochial
 
education o
f the students.
 
At his parish's wish Father Abi-Chedid built first the new church and tnen
 
the rectory. Working with the Ladies' Altar Society and the Knights of St.
 
Maron, a special parish organization established for the purpose, Father
 
Abi-Chedid raised the money necessary for the first half of the school
 
building. Finally,  in 1
958 the prospective school's auditorium/cafeteria was
 
completed and in 1960 the first four of the planned eight classrooms. The
 
completed complex would be in the shape of a cross. The school was t
o have
 
eight grades and teach all subjects required by the state. In addition,  the
 
school would offer instruction in Lebanese h
eritage and the Maronite Rite.
 
To ensure the realization o
f his dream, Father Abi-Chedid established a
 
trust fund designated specifically for the school. It totalled $250,000 in
 
1
969, when he retired from the parish. The school fund was kept
 
all other church accounts, so that it could be hidden from the

This money in the trust  fund was placed by an organization
 
in the church that was working toward building a school. It
 
was a St. Maron organization. And they put the money in the

The parish,  therefore, owns a school complex of which  it makes  ver ,.
 
use. The land adjacent,  designated for the remainder of the school,  stall 
vacant.  In such a situation it is unlikely that the school issue would e
 
1
1
 
disappear from memory.  Indeed, today's parishioners and priest report that,
 
over ten years later,  it i
s the key to the factionalization within the
 
congregation.
 
Advocates of the school foresee a full curriculum of public and parochial
 
school subjects, as well as supplementary classes, including Lebanese history
 
and culture, the Maronite Rite, and the Arabic language. James Mezrano believes
 
that Arabic should be begun "at an early age--two or three. I think i
t would be
 
great for the younger, because it's easier for them to speak at that time."
 
(ES82-Mc/C-C16) Elizabeth Boohaker describes the school she envisions

where they came from. Teach them the history of Lebanon
 
from the time of the Phoenicians to the time of our
 
present-day situation. Teach them their religion, which is
 
the oldest rite in the church. Teach them the family life.
 
And besides, they would get this basic education that
 
is necessary for college or high school.  .  .  .  We were
 
gonna have nuns who would teach them in English, except the
 
Arabic language, and the rite, and the church —the hymns,
 
the prayers, and everything that they would learn in
 
church.  .
 .
 .  Probably they would have included in their
 
classes the Arabic language, as a course. That would be in
 
addition to their regular studies.  (ES82-Mc/C C4)
 
Pupils would be drawn from the 250 or 300 (informants'  estimates vary)
 
children in the parish. Others might come from Latin Catholic families who feel
 
their children "miss all that tradition and heritage" in the Latin church,
 
suggests Mezrano. Financial arguments are made in addition to the cultural and
 
religious justifications for the school: between fifty and seventy-five percent
 
of St. Elias's children attend Latin parochial schools, where they pay
 
out-of-parish tuition. Supplements provided by St. Elias to families who cannot
 
meet  the cost amount to at least  $15,000 per year.  Combined with the surpius
 
the treasury (which advocates see as school money,  despite the court decision
 
this money could go a long way toward staffing a school,  if it is run by nuns ]
 
Even the teaching staff of  the projected school is a much discussed issue.
 
Father Abi-Chedid had first planned to bring eight nuns directly from Lebanon.
 
Later the parish contacted nuns at  the Maronite National Shrine in Youngstown.
 
"We had Maronite nuns  .
 
—
 
. waiting to teach,  and the bishop did not encourage
 
them",  recalls Elizabeth Boohaker.  "We have a bishop who is not very
 
aggressive. He did not encourage them.  They finally got disgusted and went back
 
to Lebanon." (ES82-Mc/C-C4) She and her family and friends have now discussed
 
the question with four Latin nuns of St.  Rose of Lima in Birmingham who attend
 
St. Elias and who report themselves willing to learn the *

jobs. Mezrano prefe rs
says,  and multilingual. His group's plan would be to send them to Sacred Heart
 
College in Cullman, Alabama until they pass the state's teacher certification
 
examination.  If established,  the St.  Elias school would be  the only Maronite
 
school in the United States.

In recent years there have been classes given by seminarians from Lebanon
 
interning under Father Saad. One man, who was at St. Elias for three summers
 
between 1
978 and 1980, offered Arabic classes twice as part of the Summer
 
Enrichment Program. This program for families includes Lebanese cooking,
 
movies, crafts, and other "enriching activities," notes Father Saad. James
 
Mezrano attended with his wife and older children. He recalls that the
 
classrooms were filled.  "We went there very energetic. There's no textbook —you
 
bring your own pencil and paper, and you get there, and you write. You try to
 
write it down and pronounce i
t, and it's very hard to pronounce."
 
While the Summer Enrichment Program i
tself lasted only four weeks, the weekly
 
Arabic classes continued throughout the summer. Father Saad observes that

During the summer o
f 1
982 Father Saad has had an intern, Mr. Joseph Kour.
 
a Lebanese-American who does not meet even the minimum Arabic-skills guidelines
 
established by the bishop. To expose Koury to the language and renew Arabic
 
teaching at the school, Father Saad arranged that an immigrant elementary
 
teacher, Jackie Aki, offer a children's class. Unlike most of the post-1965
 
immigrants,  the Aki family i
s highly language retentive, a fact that Father
 
Saad attributes to their plans to return to Lebanon. Mrs. Akl, who teaches her
 
own daughter at home, agreed to take on other children in the six to ten age
 
group. An announcement in the Sunday bulletin drew children and a number of
 
adults to the course. An additional immigrant teacher, Michael Wehby, was then
 
found,  and an adult class has also begun.

Both classes meet f
or just one hour each week during the Sunday school
 
period between early and late mass. The t
ime is usually devoted to religious
 
instruction. As Joseph Koury and Father Saad describe the children's class,  it
 
now has just over ten children. Mrs. Akl i
s introducing the alphabet, reading
 
and writing, counting, and rhymes for word memorization, using photocopies of
 
elementary schoolbooks she used in Lebanon. She assigns homework tasks of
 
rewriting, copying, and translating, which the pupils have completed
 
diligently. The seven or eight adults in the other class requested
 
conversational Arabic. Their time is devoted to speaking, not reading and
 
writing, with the exception of learning the characters associated with the
 
sounds which have no parallel in English. Practical conversational phrases seem
 
t
o be the main emphasis. This appears to be the first course at St. Elias
 
genuinely following a conversation approach. So far the attendance has b
een
 
good and enthusiasm high. Most of the adult students have minor passive
 
knowledge of Arabic, but cannot speak it. Father Saad expects the classes to go
 
on into the fall,  if interest continues at the present level. The adults had
 
hoped for a longer session or a weekday evening class, but their t
eacher was
 
not available except on Sunday mornings. If the adult classes continue,  they
 
may have to be scheduled for another t
ime.

funds, first for the church and rectory and then for the school. Now, with no
 
plans for further expansion of the school, there are far fewer activities at
 
the church,  because money-making projects are not necessary.  Father Saad,  the
 
current priest at St. Elias,  is not an advocate of  the school.  The struggle
 
around ethnic education has now shifted,  therefore,  from one between the parish
 
and the church hierarchy to one between conflicting factions within St.  Elias
 
tET u..
.
 
Father Saad argues  that  the plan for a school runs counter to the general
 
movement  in the Catholic church away from parochial education brought 1
about 
1
11
 
the loss of nuns and the high cost of lay teachers. More importantly,  however,
 
h
r  -t* Maronitism as a rite, a special tradition of Catholicism,  and resists
 
the equation of Maronitism with Lebanese ethnicity.  In part  it is a question of
 
making clear the doctrinal and ritual integrity upon which the church  is  based.
 
As he explains:
 
People associated the rites  [Maronite and Melkite]  with
 
ethnic communities which wanted their own parishes.  And
 
that is a misnomer, because a rite is a distinct entity in
 
the Catholic church,  and that includes us. We're a Maronite
 
church and they're  [St.  George Melkitel  a Greek Catholic
 
church. And so those will stand, you know. The ethnic
 
thing,  if we depended only on ethnicity,  I think it would

 i  peculiar to
 
lb
 
ambivalence appears to s
tem from a fear that the emphasis will t
ip away from
 
the internal Maronite faith to external cultural manifestations of a
 
non-religious nature, rather than that the association of Maronite with
 
Lebanese i
s incorrect. As a priest, his primary concern is with spiritual
 
affairs and the maintenance of the faith. He does not wish to see himself in a
 
dual role a
s the leader of the ethnic community. No doubt this,  too, is partly
 
the response of an urban A
merican. Perhaps an additional factor i
s that this
 
Lebanese Maronite parish in the Deep South, long isolated and self dependent,
 
and  has different expectations of the roles its priest should assume than a
 
parish in a more densely Maronite area such as the Northeast might.
 
Father Saad's parishioners do not attempt to make the delicate distinctions
 
between faith and nationality upon which their priest insists. As Elizabeth
 
Boohaker puts it,  "Well, that sort of goes together, being Maronite and being
 
Lebanese. If you're Lebanese you're Maronite. Because the Maronite i
s the
 
majority in Lebanon." For her,  "Well, the church, really,  i
s the r
eal
 
foundation of the [Lebanese]  community. Everyone gathers there. If you don't
 
see them at all, you see them at church." (ES82-Mc/C--C4) James Mezrano, too,
 
directly connects his religious and cultural life:
 
I love it.  1 love the music, the food,  t
he dancing --it's
 
all the religion. To me it's a great culture.  .
 .
 .  We
 
[
i.e., American-Lebanese generally] keep the food and l
ose
 
all the others [elements of culture], and we're so
 
fortunate that we have the church and our whole life.  .
 
Right now the church is the center of everybody's life;
 
that's what's holding us all together. If we didn't have
 
the church, we'd be like all the other Lebanese
 
communities. I think we're very fortunate in this area t
o
 
have two churches [
i.e.,  two Lebanese churches,  St. Elias
 
and St. George Melkite].  (ES82-Mc/C-C16)
 
For these parishioners furthering the i
-
laronite cause and Maronite education are
 
identical to furthering Lebanese ethnic awareness and cultural maintenance;
 
they are simply not separable.
 
The struggle surrounding the St.  Elias school must  be understood in light
 
of  the above sentiments. Father Saad and his parishioners share deep concerns
 
about the education Maronite children receive in the Latin schools and the
 
negative impact  that Latin school tends to have on the level of participation
 
at  St. Elias--families are drawn to work for the school's parish instead of
 
their own,  and the children make friends among their Latin Rite schoolmates.  In
 
addition,  part of  the Latin school curriculum is Catholic liturgy,  catechism,
 
and custom,  and  Maronite children learn that this "is" Catholicism. Until
 
Father Abi-Chedid started to grant first communion to St. Elias youngsters
 
early —six instead of seven years of age —the Maronite children were even
 
studying for and taking their communion at school in the Latin Rite with their
 
Latin classmates.

will be readings  from the books, or films and tapes about the rite and Lebanese
 
If this approach -- centering more on Maronite Catholicism and making clear
 
the specific ritual,  dogma,  and history of the church,  supplemented with
 
certain cultural activities--is sufficient for Father Saad,  it certainly is not
 
for advocates of  the St. Elias school. They argue for the necessity of a school
 
from various perspectives. Elizabeth Boohaker,  the daughter of early immigrants
 
to Birmingham,  for example,  represents  the faction of school advocates oriented
 
toward the old country. She and her family are extremely
 
conservative --socially,  religiously,  and ethnically. Much of  her concern with
 
the Latin schools is that they are no longer strict enough with the children.
 
She feels  that the liberalization of the liturgy,  the lifestyles
 
nuns, and the approach to social issues in the Latin church have
 
mistakes. Of the Latin nuns she would hope to retain as  teachers

functions. Bringing a non-Lebanese Catholic spouse into St. Elias does not make
 
amends. The Boohakers drew a parallel between excommunication from the family
 
and excommunication from the church:
 
They knew at the time they did that that they would lose
 
their privileges of unity to the family.  .

their active support from almost all parish activities because o
f what they see
 
as religious liberalizations, and because of disagreements over the school.
 
They think the church is now "mainly social," not religious. This family has
 
been central to all fund-raising activities in the past, but "I told them,  '
You
 
want our family back here, you going to have to start that school going,
 
because the church doesn't need anything else!'" says Boohaker. (ES82-Mc/C-C4)
 
While James Mezrano shares Elizabeth Boohaker's concern over
 
the integrity of the family and abhors marriage outside of the ethnic and
 
religious community, he arrives at his support of the school in a somewhat
 
different fashion. A third-generation American in his mid-thirties, he has no
 
strong ties to the old country. Whereas Boohaker has two nephews who will
 
return to Lebanon to marry village girls during 1982, Mr. Mezrano, his family,
 
and even his parents have never visited the country. He is not trying to
 
maintain traditional Lebanese ways in the United States, but to create a seiis
 
of place and self for his Lebanese-American family, having inherited a
 
fragmentary culture. While others in his age group opted for assimilat
 
escape from "foreign-ness," he has overcome the ethnic, minority-child
 
experience by integrating and promoting his Lebanese heritage. He speaks of the
 
2
1
 
privileges he had in Birmingham in comparison to his wife, who grew up Lebanese
 
in a Mississippi town with no ethnic or ethno-religious institutions. For
 
Mezrano the St. Elias school would be a means of passing on to his children a
 
fuller cultural experience and sense of place. He wants them to have what he
 
did not. He describes his position regarding the school as follows:
 
I
'm not that old country, and I
'm not that modern. But I
 
think we should know who we are, and about our background,
 
and to be proud of i
t.  .
 .
 .  A lot of people my age wish we
 
could speak it [Arabic], and that's how come we want the
 
school. You know, there are a lot of young married couples
 
with children.  .
 .
 .  We'd just have a fit to have a school
 
down there .
 .
 .  I would just love for my kids to go to
 
their own church, to their own school, and to participate
 
and be around their heritage more and be around their own
 
people more.  (ES82-Mc/C-C16).
 
It i
s not so much reaction or resistance t
o external social change that
 
motivates Mezrano, but a positive affirmation of an immigrant experience and
 
cultural heritage.
 
Interestingly,  it i
s James Aezrano who i
s most emphatic about Arabic
 
language retention or renewal. Elizabeth Boohaker was raised in an
 
Arabic-speaking home and some of her nieces and nephews speak the language. Her
 
brothers' homes are basically English-speaking, however, and the new Boohaker
 
Lebanese brides are multilingual, although their Lebanese-American grooms are
 
not. Mezrano, essentially a monolingual, tries to use all the Arabic words and
 
phrases he still remembers in daily conversation at home. Boohaker mentioned
 
many innovations at St. Elias which distressed her, but the increasing use of
 
English in the liturgy was not one. Mezrano, on the other hand, wants to see
 
the entire mass returned to Arabic. Because he completely identifies M
 
with Lebanese heritage.

At S
t. Elias today ninety-five percent o

Consecration i
s recited in Aramaic and the choir sings "a couple of hymns" in
 
Arabic. This is a radical shift from 1
940, when Father Abi-Chedid was coached
 
by Josephine Sharbel so that he could recite his first reading of the gospel in
 
English; he memorized the sounds, not understanding a single word. Sharbel, a
 
professional musician, has also transcribed numerous Arabic hymns into
 
phonetics for the use of monolingual choir members. Prayer books have bilingual
 
texts and a phonetic rendering of the Arabic, so that parishioners can read
 
along. Father Saad thinks the switch to English has been a good move:
 
I
'm satisfied with just keeping the flavor o
f it.
 
Aramaic is more important  [
than Arabic], because it was the
 
liturgical language. Like Latin, i
t was preserved just for
 
the liturgy. And Aramaic was closer to our people, because
 
they spoke it at one time. And also, Christ spoke Aramaic.
 
So I think there will always be a closeness to that, to
 
that language, because of those associations.  .
 .

know,  I have a flavor, a flavor for it too, and I can read
 
Syriac,  'cause that's how we're trained.  .
 .  .  My idea was
 
that, if the rite was going to thrive, people had to know
 
what they're doing, especially the young. I think these
 
things are, can be, transmitted with a flavor, but in
 
English. What they never knew, what it was before. And the
 
thing about these churches--the Maronite and the Melkite
 
churches,  this old way of thinking —was that they were
 
old-country churches, you know, for the old people, or
 
those who didn't speak English. I think we've had to change
 
that, if there was going to be any hope for the young
 
people to come, to understand what they were doing.  .

/
 
Greek migration to the United States has always followed political
 
developments in the Mediterranean area, particularly between 1
880 and 1
920, a
 
period marked by continued tensions between Greece and Turkey, the Balkan Wars
 
(
1912-1913), and the flight of Greeks from army conscription or persecution in
 
Asia Minor-\7/Turbulent internal politics and unstable leadership also
 
contributed to the exodus at this time. Most of the early Greek immigrants to
 
America, however, left their homeland as a result of the poverty resulting from
 
the severe depression of its agricultural economy. The Peloponnesian peninsula
 
was especially hard hit from 1882 to 1
886, when the European market for raisins
 
and currants, Greece's principal exports, collapsed.
/
 
Most of the earliest immigrants to the United States until after World War
 
II were unskilled single males. They often planned to return with their savings
 
from America to their Peloponnesian villages to establish a farm or business,
 
26
 
or to support their kin or dower their daughter or sister, both s
trong Greek
 
traditions. Many of the Greek immigrants to Birmingham, however, as well as
 
those who settled elsewhere in the country after 1
900, were already married, or
 
later returned to Greece to find a bride, intending from the outset t
o
 
establish permanent residency in America
/
 
The majority of the early Greek immigrants to Birmingham came from the
 
Peloponnesian area and the i
slands of Corfu, Samos, and Rhodes. They settled in
 
metropolitan Birmingham, a
s well as in many of the satellite
 
c
ommunities —Ensley, Bessemer, Wylam, and Pratt City in particular--oriented
 
t
oward Jefferson County's coal mines and iron and steel mills.
 
Reports on the number of early Greek residents in the city conflict, and
 
official U.S. government immigration and census statistics are inconsistent.
 
Growing from the 100 enumerated in the 1
900 census, Greek residents in
 
Birmingham numbered 900 and 1
,200 in Ensley by 1913.\ 3 /ensus data from
 
1
920, however, reports only 485 Greeks in Birmingham.
 
In this early phase of the county's industrial development labor was in
 
short supply, and southern blacks as well as  immigrants from southern and
 
eastern Europewere sought for the heavy, dirty, manual work. By as early as
 
1909 there were 500 Greeks in Ensley, many living in the Sherman Heights area,
 
where "nine out of one hundred stores were Greek owned," and the majority of
 
the Greek residents were Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company
 
employees.\1

elsewhere, began leaving their jobs as common laborers to go into retail

community's history in this country.

"the

building. In 1935 the dissident parish, Holy Cross, was officially recognized
 
by the Archdiocese and a canonical priest, Father Milelis, was sent to replace

Cross built a new  church next door to its old one, again with AHEPA's aid, and
 
began using the former church as an educational building. In 1
949, after some
 
disagreement about relocation to an area nearer the homes of one community
 
group, Holy Trinity built the present church (dedicated and consecrated in
 
1
956) on its old site. In the same year Holy Cross built a new Youth Center
 
(dedicated in 1
951) for educational and r
ecreational purposes.
 
Reconciliation efforts betweem the churches began seriously in 1
947.  It
 
was the social activities of the youth groups of both parishes that f
inally
 
reunited the Greek—American community in Birmingham. The factionalism between
 
the two churches had divided the entire community for thirty years, during
 
'
Which time the community's mutual aid and church—affiliated organizations,
 
I
ncluding the church youth groups, had also split off into separate chapters.
 
In the 1950s the two church youth groups —Holy Trinity's Elliniki Orthodoxy
 
Neolea (EON) and Holy Cross' Orthodoxy Elliniki Neolea (OEN) —began opening
 
their social and recreational functions to one another 2> %he

kids. There were old gold coins. People were crying. We
 
realized all the great things that needed to be done for
 
the community co ld  ot be done without the communities
 
pulling together.
 
The first public step toward reestablishing the unity of the Greek
 
American community in Birmingham was taken one month after the GOYA convention
 
with an announcement published in the Holy Trinity Church bulletin that i
ts
 
parish had been invited by Holy Cross, its "sister church," "to unite with
 
them" for the Divine Liturgy celebrating Holy Cross' nameday. Shortly after
 
this announcement local attorneys were retained to counsel both parishes and
 
present a proposal to unify the community. Parishioners from both churches
 
voted on the proposal —Holy Trinity members met in their Educational Building
 
and holy Cross members met in their new Youth Center. On the second vote both
 
committees were unanimously in favor of union

The binding legal contract named the reconciled 1
,500-mem ber parish TH
 
United Greek Orthodox Community of Holy Trinity-Holy Cross of Birmingham,
 
Alabama. It specified that a new priest would be brought in to serve the
 
community and outlined the usages of both parishes' new buildings. The H
 
Trinity Educational Building was to be used for joint Sunday school and Greek
 
school classes;  the Holy Cross Youth Center was to be used for all parish
 
32
 
social functions. This mutual use of each parish's former property appears to
 
have continued until the 1970s, when the unified parish sold the property of
 
the old Holy Cross Church, after it had been damaged in a fire. To "satisfy the
 
newer generation," Holy Trinity-Holy Cross replaced the old educational
 
building with a modern one —the Hellenic Orthodox Christian Center--dedicated
 
in 1973. It contains Sunday school classrooms, the Greek language school
 
classroom, a parish library, social halls, a gymnasium/auditorium, meeting
 
rooms, and offices.
 
Most o
f the Greek-Americans in Birmingham interviewed about the split
 
agreed that i
t was unfortunate, but rationalized the community factionalism by
 
drawing on Greek proverbial lore. As Nicholas Christu said,  "I know division i
s
 
no good and all that, but, on the other side, it bring you progress, too. You
 
have to fight for existence, you know.  .

 .
'\ J 4hristine Grammas recalls,
 
"Everybody wanted to be chiefs. Nobody wanted to be an Indian. That's the
 
trouble. That's the trouble with Greeks." (E582-Mc/C14)
 
Today Holy Trinity-Holy Cross is the third largest Greek Orthodox parish
 
in the South, ranking behind Atlanta and Houston. It boasts the largest
 
congregation and the only cathedral in the state of Alabama. Other smaller
 
Greek Orthodox parishes exist in Montgomery, Huntsville, and Mobile. There is a
 
"mission parish" as well, in Daphne, Alabama. Since the 1953 reunification the
 
Holy Trinity-Holy Cross parish has had five priests, including Father
 
Vasilakis, the current priest. A variety of church-affiliated groups continue
 
to fulfill important aspects of the parish's religious, educational, and social
 
missions. At the present t
ime the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross roster lists 650
 
members, about seventy-five percent of whom, according to Father Vasilakis, are
 
33
 
"ethnic Greek." The parish includes a mix of Lebanese, Palestinian, Russian,
 
Ukrainian, and other non-Greek nationalities as well, however. While the
 
problem of marriage outside the Greek Orthodox faith, or to a member o
f a
 
non-Greek ethnic group, is still an active issue in the community,  i
t i
s not as
 
volatile as in times past. The issue of the liturgical language, on the other
 
hand,  i
s a controversial one among parishioners today. The community is
 
currently split between those wanting to further increase the percentage of the
 
liturgy that is in English (which has increased from fifty percent Greek and
 
fifty percent English to thirty-five percent Greek and sixty-five percent
 
English since Father Vasilakis's arrival eighteen months ago)  and those wanting
 
a return to services that are entirely in Byzantine Greek.
 
History of Holy Trinity, Holy Cross, and Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Greek Schools
 
The first language classes in Birmingham's Greek Orthodox community were
 
offered shortly after the founding of Holy Trinity Church. As early as 1907

The earliest Greek school classes were held from June to September f
or
 
three hours daily, Monday through Saturday. One room accomodated all elementary
 
grades and the teacher's time was divided among students of various grade
 
levels. As many as ninety students at one time —their desks arranged according
 
to age and ability —studied Greek grammar, history, geography, literature,
 
mythology, folksongs, drama, and dialogue. Exercise drills occurred on
 
Saturdays, when religion was also taught and athletics practiced. The only
 
available curricular materials were those imported from Greece by the teacher;
 
the teacher often had the only official books and students copied lessons from
 
the blackboard into their tetradia or notebooks 33/Iote learning, memorization,
 
and recitation were the standard learning methods. Strict disciplinary measures
 
were the rule.

Maude Morgan, another second-generation Greek from Birmingham,  recalls her
 
early experiences in the "Hellenic"  classes from around  1922 to 1928:
 
It was just a little,  a house actually to start with,  that they
 
had bought and converted into the Greek school. And my mother
 
happened to be on the Board of Education for the Greek school,
 
curriculum was reading,  grammar, writing, of course, and not
 
penmanship writing, but what they used to call orthographia, 
which was  the correct spelling . . . . And correct grammar.

exercises a

A succession of Greek-born schoolteachers followed Father Lambrinides's
 
tenure at the Greek school. Many teachers during this period also traveled on
 
certain weeknights to the steel mill towns of Ensley and Fairfield to hold
 
Greek school classes for the parishioners in those communities-
'
%'n 1

controversy began to develop in the Birmingham Greek Orthodox community over
 
the hiring of teachers for the Greek school, its site, and policy-making
 
decisions. The argument culminated with the 1933 split of the community and the
 
formation of the separate Holy Cross parish. This resulted in the establishment
 
of a second Greek school in Birmingham, supported by the fund-raising efforts
 
Chapter 3  of the AHEPA and by a Holy Cross ladies' group, Pistis-Elpis-Agapis
 
Cross offered its own "parochial
 
and then, beginning
 
afternoon school of Greek," taught first by Mr
 
around 1942, by the church's rector, the Reverend D. N. Sakellarides. After
 
1
949 Christine Sepsas taught the classes, first taking pupils into her home
 
and later affiliating with the new Holy Cross parish. Mrs.  Sepsas's mother had
 
also been a Greek-school teacher. Her cousin A1exandr
Bonduris describes
 
Christine Sepsas as a "self-taught, natural-born teacher," who was prevented
 
from attending college because Greek custom and family finances would only
 
allow her brother to receive a higher education. No longer a Greek-school
 
teacher, Mrs.  Sepsas apparently has  returned to offering classes in her home,
 
teaching English to new immigrants  in Birmingham.  (ES82-Mc/C-C14)
 
Another teacher  from the Holy Trinity parish —Irene Kampakis, who
 
graduated from a teachers'  school in Athens —is also widely remembered today in
 
the Greek community in Birmingham and is described by her former students as
 
being .
. 
very learned." She taught Tasia Fifles,  the third-generation,
 
Greek-American daughter s
)  Christi ne 
T Gra m mas,
 
Trinity in the late  1930s and early 1940s. As Fifles recalls:
 
The class was divided —each row was a dif f erent grade.  And,
 
you know,  that's surprising,  because every Greek child was
 
going to Greek 
just a handful,  every
 
I 
Greek child in my generation, every Greek child was going
 
to Greek school,  everyday,  right after school. We'd get on
 
the bus,  get the tickets from the Birmingham Electric
 
Company,
 
ecause that's what used to be the streetcar . . .

Cross Cathedral illustrates the prevailing post-war attitudes as well as
 
generational differences and similarities toward their children's ethnic
 
language education:
 
dorgan:
 Well, why do you not send your children to Greek
 
School? Or have they ever gone?
 
Fifles:
 They didn't want to go.
 
Morgan:
 Have your children ever gone to Greek school?
 
Fifles:
 Never gone to Greek school. I
'll tell you why not.  I
 
would have to do all the transporting. They had so many  other
 
things to and I would have to take them. And I guess it was
 
just,  their interest wasn't that big for me to sacrifice that
 
time at that time. Now, oh yeah, now they want it.  .
 .
 .
 Now
 
they're learning i
t. Now they want to know Greek. But I couldn't
 
tell them that, you know, ten years ago.
 
Morgan:
 They blame the parents for not making them.
 
Fifles:
 And then they would have blamed you for making them
 
go. I used to blame by mother.
 
Morgan:
 When he [my son] went to college, I  never will
 
forget, when he came home, on his first trip back home .
 .
 .
 he
 
turns around to me and he says, "I'll  never forgive
 
you for not making me go to Greek school."
 
Fifles:
 I feel I
've failed my kids,  'cause when they were
 
L
ittle, if I had spoke Greek, spoken Greek to them as they grew
 
u
p ,
 they would know something, and I didn't. And I thought, just
 
bringing  them down here [from the suburbs] for  one hour a day,
 
f
or once a week, what are they  going to learn in that short
 
L
ittle time? .
 .
 .
 But, I thought, well gosh, they don't even
 
know how to count to ten, they're going to have to learn all
 
that, and one hour a week i
s nothing. (This and interview quotes

By the mid-1960s and through the early 1
970s Greek school classes at the
 
united Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Church had decreased to once-a-week evening
 
classes, with a very high attrition rate by the end of each school year. Two of
 
our informants (Georgia Kampakis and Janice Mastoras) had school-aged children
 
during this period, but in each case their children only attended Greek school
 
for a few months and the experience was "not very beneficial" for them. The

t
o the the suburbs,  to competition over their children's free time between
 
parish-related schools and clubs and the extra-curricular activities of the
 
parochial or public schools, to their children's increasing interaction and
 
identification with their peers in "American" school, and, perhaps most
 
importantly, to decreasing parental authority and increasing maternal leniency,
 
for which these mothers assume a great deal of responsibility, even guilt.
 
Although it was not directly discussed by any of our American-born
 
informants, part of the problem during this period appears to have been
 
s
taffing difficulties.
 In the late 1
960s the one teacher at the Holy
 
Trinity-Holy Cross Greek school was an elderly woman from Greece whose teaching
 
style was not well received by her students, accustomed to the ways of the
 
American schools. Nichi Jovaras called her a "strict, discipline [sic], classic
 
Greek schoolteacher" in the old country fashion. She was followed in the early
 
to mid-1970s by Dr. Michaels, an immigrant from Cyprus and speaker of the
 
Cypriot dialect, who was also unpopular here. Nichi Jovaras, who immigrated to
 
the United States in the 1950s, describes his pedagogical methods and how she
 
herself took over some of his students in 1
978 or 1
979, becoming a teacher at
 
Holy Trinity-Holy Cross:
 
He was not for children. He [
should have taught] adults.
 
He was really tough on the children, you know. He
 
thought he was back in Greece, in the old school in Greece,
 
and, you know, children would resent it .  .  .  and nobody
 
wanted to go to Greek school. So then one day they asked me
 
i
f I wanted to teach .  .  .  because I had children, you
 
know.  .  .  .  Well, I
'll tell you how it started. There was
 
these three little girls —intermarriage, you know —so they
 
were going to this Greek school with Mr.  [
sic] Michaels.
 
Well, one day he made a mistake. In Greek [he said], "Look
 
at all these American kids come to Greek school." Well
 
naturally .  .  .  they didn't want to go back. And Donna
 
40
 
[
Nichi Jovaras' youngest daughter] says,  "If they're not
 
going to go,  then I
'm not going to go." So I said,  "If
 
you're going to sit at home, then I
'm going to teach you.'
 
•
 .
 •  And the little girls say, "Well, can we come too?"
 
And I say,  "Yeah." And that was good, because that was one
 
t
ime Donna really learned her Greek because, see,  the four
 
of them together, I had them two days a week, and I make
 
them do things. I make them learn, and they [learned],
 
l
ike, "I want to go outside and play" and "Here's a
 
beautiful tree," children's conversation." (ES82-Mc/C-C12)
 
Nichi Jovaras has now taught Greek language classes at Holy Trinity-holy
 
Cross on one or two weekday evenings for the past four years. This past
 
semester she taught a two-hour Tuesday evening class to a mixed group of
 
students, but their attendance was irregular and attrition rates were high.
 
During the same period, and apparently up through this year,
 
Theodor (Ted)
 
Lafakis  also a native Greek speaker, taught some afternoon and evening GreeK
 
è
ii5ol classes, experiencing many of the same problems.34 In her class of older
 
students last semester, in which everyone knew the Greek alphabet, Jovaras used
 
Methods of English, which her father employed when he taught her brother Greek.
 
It is printed in Greek, English "phonetics," and English translation, and
 
focuses on exercises for social and business conversation as well as s
tory and
 
letter writing. Her students included fourth-generation Greek-American children
 
and spouses converted to Greek Orthodoxy through intermarriage. She describes
 
their mixed attitudes toward language acquisition as follows:
 
Now I do have s
tudents in that class that would rather not
 
use the English phonetics, but read i
t in Greek, and they
 
do. But I did find out one thing--the non-Greeks that
 
within a marriage,  that [are] within the Greek faith
 
[
through intermarriage], they're more receptive to learn
  
than the ones that actually are Greek, because they apply
  
themselves because that's what they're there for. They have
 
an aim within themselves to do something, so they are the
 
ones that are really my best students. They are learning, 
because that's what they are applying themselves to do.  •
 
• No, we don't have history, all we're doing is strictly
 
conversation, but, like I said, they do know the alphabet.

o
 y Cross for adults only. This past semester he had six s
tudents in
 
this class: his wife Sheree, a third-generation Greek-American who came t
o
 
Birmingham from Florida in 1
980 when they were married; a student who has not
 
been attending regularly because she has a n
ew baby; an "American" woman who
 
married a first-generation Greek; Terri Grammas, an e
thnic Irish and r
ecent
 
c
onvert from Roman Catholicism, married t
o a second-generation Greek-American
 
from Birmingham who i
s twenty years her senior; and the Grammas's two
 
daughters. Terri Grammas describes her daughters' e
thnic identification, and
 
their attitudes t
oward Greek School:
 
[They]  are very close to  their background.  The Greek is
 
definitely prevalent. My children are so Greek-oriented
 
that when they filled our applications for school  [a
 
special public school,  gifted-child program]--they're
 
twelve and fourteen--and they asked for nationality,  they
 
put down Greek . . . . And I was in a state of shock.  It
 
didn't occur to me that they would ever consider anything
 
but American, but, you know,  the Greek is really ingrained
 
in them.- . . . (But]  one of them is rebelling against it
 
[Greek School class]  - . . the younger one. Where the older
 
one comes and enjoys it —she has more of a knack for
 
languages than the other one.  (ES82 - Mc/C-C6)
 
Kanellopoulos describes the books he uses in the Saturday class:
 
I went through a lot of books from there  [Greece]  and fou ­
ones that,  in my opinion,  are good books so I . . . tak ,
, 
the history of the 1821 revolution, Iliad and Odyssey, i
:
:
::
 
some history of that era also,  and,  uh,  since I know what
 
they know, what I do is I read a chapter and rewrite in a
 
way that would be understood by the people . . . . I was
 
42
 
writing little things,  little essays,  I guess,  in English
 
or in Greek, and they would have to translate it  to the
 
other language. And I teach them some grammar and
 
syntax —syntax i
s very important. It's very simple. There
 
were very few rules.  .
 .
 .  What we do is basically, my plan
 
was to try to teach the people, uh, every time we meet a
 
number of new words and that's how we s
tarted out. And then
 
after some time, you know, enough words, presumably, have
 
been learned from both phrases [
sic], and [
they] make
 
little essays using those words.  .
 .
 .  (ES82-Mc/C-C9)
 
Kanellopoulos's classes, which will resume after a hiatus for h
is
 
students'  and his own vacations, are expected to continue in the fall with many
 
of the same students, some beginning their third and fourth years. Jovaras also
 
plans to teach again in the fall. Taking into account the commitment of the
 
teachers and the attitude of the priest toward Greek school classes at Holy
 
Trinity-Holy Cross,  there is no reason to believe that the level of language
 
education activity will diminish in the foreseeable future.
 
Ethnic Maintenance: Greek Institutionalized Education
 
The factionalism over the Greek school in the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross
 
parish that split the community for thirty years no longer dominates this
 
community; it is now thought of as a remote event. Vestigial factors underlying
 
the controversy are manifested in parishioners' attitudes toward community
 
identity and the value of, rationale for, and problems in sustaining effective
 
ethnic heritage and language education programs. Community opinions about the
 
Greek school —its past history, present status, and prospects for the
 
future —often correlate with factors such as t
ime of immigration, age group,
 
occupation, class status, education, place of residence, native and home
 
language, and ethnic and religious traditionalism or assimilationism, all
 
43
 
which were important elements in the controversy. Terri Grammas, a relative
 
newcomer to the Birmingham Greek Orthodox community through intermarriage,
 
characterizes i
ts composition with reference to several of these factors:
 
In the Greek community,  to me, there's two factions. The
 
Greeks from the old country [
"Greek  Greeks," as she calls
 
themj  that, I don't even know i
f they've ever become
 
American citizens.  .
 .
 .  Most of the Greeks here still have
 
f
amily in Greece or in Cyprus, and I think that has a lot
 
to do with it. They do really keep up with the news there.
 
It's surprising. We don't, you know, because we don't have
 
family there.  .
 .
 .  I don't really know how the split has
 
come.  .
 .
 .  There will always be a lot of conflict. They
 
won't change. They won't change their attitudes, ever.
 
There is still a group here that is fighting, every inch of
 
the way.  .
 .
 .  I would say [
the other group: "American
 
Greeks" has very educated people —lawyers, doctors,
 
t
eachers. The others [
first group] are restaurant owners,
 
people that have maybe a high school education, not
 
necessarily in this country, but, you know, some of them
 
do; but who have been raised very strictly Greek--you know,
 
spoke Greek in the home. (ES82-Mc/C-C7)
 
In addition to Terri Gratninas's polarized "Greek Greeks" and "American Greeks,"
 
a third, mediating position rounds our the Greek parishioners' own picture of
 
Holy Trinity-Holy Cross ethnic identity. As Christine Grammas explains:
 
See, it's what you learn at home. You've got to go  [with]
 
what you learn at home. You see, when my daddy used to see,
 
when we used to see the Greek flag--well, we marched and we
 
see that Greek flag waving and the American flag right next
 
to it. Why, you know, you'd just have all that patriotism
 
in you for both countries. Because they're r
ight there,
 
side by side. (ES82-Mc/C-C14)
 
Her sister, Alexandra Bonduris, agrees,  "
Papa always said,  '
You're an American.
 
Don't ever forget you're an American, but never forget your Greek heritage.' He
 
instilled that in us.
 (ES82-Mc/C-C9)
 
44
 
Clearly, the strong Greek immigrant imperatives for educational and
 
occupational advancement into the American middle class are critical in the
 
study of language and ethnic heritage education among Greeks in Birmingham
 
and are viewed as paradoxical by members of the community themselves. Maude
 
Morgan comments on the Greek "entrepreneurial tradition" that coalesces with
 
its American counterpart, the work ethic:
 
The Greek people are hardworking people and they're
 
always trying to better themselves, trying to progress
 
in whatever they're doing, and they want something
 
better for their children .
 .
 .
 .
 And, for example, my
 
husband was an established produce man, not from the
 
very beginning. When he first came here--he came here as
 
an orphan when he was fourteen and, of course, he went
 
into the restaurant business like so many others have.
 
But when he really went into business for himself,
 
went into the wholesale produce business, and, eve
 
though my children were in high school and went on
 
college while he was still in this business, he dio
 
want this for them. He didn't like the hours of the
 
business. He didn't like not being able to do things
 
because of the hours, to participate in other things
 
socially. And now, what is so funny, my older son is
 
graduate of Vanderbilt University. And he was an Eng
 
major, and he'd gotten part of his master's degree f
 
English and history and then went off to Korea. When
 
came back [he went]  in the restaurant business.  [Laughs.
 
He's the one who owns the restaurant.  .
 .
 .  But, it was
 
so funny.
 .
 .
 .  Like I said, we wajired something
 
better for them.  (
ES82-Mc/C-C8)
 
C
. W
. Jovaras characterizes the community's sense o
f cultural necessity for
 
the preservation and perpetuation of the Greek heritage:
 
To me, without traditions it's nothing;  that's the way I
 
feel. And I hope I can instill this to my children.
 
Without traditions we are nothing. You are blank. Well,
 
really —that's the key. And traditions have got to be
 
maintained, not only within the church, but at least
 
within the home, the family. And, ok, so we change and
 
we, uh, you know, look the other way, you know, when we
 
start raping our various other traditions in the name of
 
liberalism, and modification, and understanding. But
 
certain traditions, if we eliminate that, why  we're
 
back to nothing, we're nobody.  (ES82-Mc/C-CIO)
 
45
 
The current status and future direction of the Greek language school in
 
Birmingham must be examined in relationship to its effectiveness in
 
maintaining this cultural imperative and in reinforcing shared community
 
values. But there is a considerable range of opinion among the parishioners
 
we interviewed about their own ethnic identification and how it has changed
 
over t
ime, a
s well as about the importance and functions of the language and
 
cultural components in this maintenance effort. For the Greek Orthodox
 
community in Birmingham we have a relatively large sample of informa nt,
 
representing a variety of opinions about the history and degrees
 
commitment to the continuation of Greek school classes. It is
 
possible to abstract a small generational sample, both by age and }v
 
of United States residency, to isolate and analyze the critica
 
sociocultural factors that interact in shaping the evolution 0!
 
community's attitudes toward mother-tongue education.
 
Since the first generation of Greek immigrants in Birmingham are now
 
deceased, the city's second generation of "whitehairs," as Father Vasilakis
 
calls them, represented in this study by Christine Grammas, Maude Morgan,
 
and Alexandra Bonduris, are the baseline from which to examine generational
 
changes in attitudes toward ethnic and language education. This group of
 
informants is perhaps the most ethnically retentive, although those cultural
 
elements they choose to preserve are often archaic relics and survivals from
 
Greece as i
t was at the time of their parents' immigration to this country.
 
Father Vasilakis sees them as having "a fantasy notion" about their
 
Hellenistic roots. These women received a grammar school, or at best, high
 
school education. Since they grew up during the post-World War I period,
 
46
 
rampant with nativism (
particularly in the Deep South), their memories of
 
experiences outside the Greek Orthodox community and of "American [public]
 
school" are often unpleasant. Their memories of attending ten ye
 
mandatory Greek school classes on a daily basis are, on the whol
 
pleasant
 
customs
 
pronunciation and grammar. It also taught them to read and write  .
 
colloquial language spoken within the rapidly growing Greek 0rthod
 
community in Birmingham. Christine Graimnas and Alexandra Bonduris s
tres
 
that learning
 
Greek s
chool,
 
the children at that time did, because the parent ,
 
couldn't speak English at all. And if they did, th :
 
wouldn't speak t
o us because they wanted us to 1e:ir:
 
Greek.

On the whole, this group of second-generation Greek Americans were
 
upwardly mobile. These women's husbands, who began working in Birmingham  is
 
street vendors, became wholesalers, retailers, and restaurant owners, and
 
their children achieved a better public school education than they had. They
 
are proud of and secure in their cultural preservation and transmission
 
activities. This is manifested in their unselfconscious continuation of home
 
and external ethnic customs, their children's attendance of Greek school,
 
and their own activities as members and officers of the Greek school board
 
and its PTA. Further evidence of their sense of Greek identity includes
 
their firm allegiance to Holy Trinity during the period of divisiveness,
 
their activity throughout the years in Greek community social organizations
 
like the Philoptochos Society and the neighborhood Knit-Chat-Chew group,  and
 
their parish work as  Sunday school teachers,  choir teachers,  and library
 
They describe  their own sense of ethnic ident-ity as "Americans born of
 
Greek descent," and their faith in Orthodoxy is so strong and their
 
knowledge of its ritual so long - standing that they tend to be rather liberal
 
on the issue of the choice of language for the liturgy. Christine Grammas
 
does not seem to care which language is used. Her
 sister Alexandra Bonduris
 
prefers that it be exclusively in the
 original Greek. Maude Morgan analyzes
 
the historical relationship between the liturgical language and
 
institutionalized language education efforts as  follows:

age in the early 1950s. They were better educated as a group then their
 
parents,  upwardly mobi le , and up per-middle 
there was little or no new immigration from Greece into the Orthe
 
co mmunity in Birmingham,  although  out-migration was beginning to occur and
 
Greek Orthodox spouses came into  the Birmingham community from elsewhere in
 
the country. Non- ethnic Greek wives,  such as Janice Mastoras,  also
 
converted to the Greek Orthodox faith during this time and joined in local
 
community activities. Greek-American communities all across the country were
 
I
undergoing 
ri
 
mainstream. These third-generation immigrants,  and their peers by
 
extra- community and interfaith marriage, appear to be the least ethnically
 
retentive and most  ethnically ambivalent of  the Greeks studied.  They have
 
been highly selective about  the elements of their e
thnic heritage they
 
choose to preserve,  have felt the most guilt about their passivity in
 
transmitting it to their children, and have rejected many of  the traditions
 
their parents saw as essential components of their own ethnic education,
 
both at home and in more institutionalized and public settings.  Not
 
s
urp risingly, however,  it is this group that has been most active in public

very proud of it. But I really don't have  [a Greek
 
identity],  and I don't  think my children have either.
 
Greek women from the 1950s generation did not push their children
 
learn the language or to go to Greek school, and their lack of
 
with regard to ethnic heritage and language maintenance is a sore
 
spot with them even today. The  problems of their move to  the suburbs,
 
increasing interaction with and influence of  their children's American
 
public/  parochial school peers,  and conflicts with extra- curricular
 
activities are most often used as a rationale for their leniency regarding
 
cultural transmission. They too,  however,  like their mothers before
 them,
 
draw a strong correlation between native home language and the
 
effectiveness of Greek school classes. Tasia Fifles discussed the
 
decreasing incidence of conversational Greek at home:

The Birmingham Greek Orthodox community's fourth generation, who grew
 
up in the late 1960s and 1
970s, during the era of increased ethnic awareness
 
and ethnic r
evivalism, c
learly defines i
tself as Greek-American. While
 
they perceive their ethnic identity as dualistic, they recognize that this
 
i
s not necessarily negative. They are in no sense ambivalent about or
 
unwilling t
o use elements of both cultures and transform them into a
 
synthesized whole that can revivify the community's sense of self-identity.
 
This fourth-generation group is represented by Terri Gra mas, a recent
 
convert through interfaith marriage, and Sheree Kannepoulos, an Orthodox
 
Greek who grew up in Florida outside any Greek Orthodox community and came
 
to Birmingham with her Greek-born husband Themis. These women are ethnically
 
self conscious and aware. They care a great deal about the revival, renewal,
 
and transmission of Greek ethnic heritage and language traditions. Both are
 
learning about the community's foodways, music, and dance from older women
 
by participating in parish social organizations, and seem to be making every
 
effort to reinterpret them in a meaningful way within their own home
 
cultures. This selfeonscious effort at ethnic education in the private
 
domain carries over into the community arena: Grau as' children are active
 
members of JOY (Junior Orthodox Youth) and participants in the parish's
 
semi-institutionalized dance classes.

Their efforts at ethnic education have further correspondences with
 
their activities regarding institutionalized language education. Tern
 
Gra
as attends the Saturday classes with her two daughters and her husband
 
Nick, a native of Birmingham who is on the Holy Trinity-Holy Cross Parish
 
Council. They are strong advocates of the Greek School:
 
It was not even publicized at that time [c.  1
977 when
 
they moved to Birminghaml  that there was a Greek school.
 
We felt it was necessary for the kids to learn Greek. We
 
still do.  It's helped them a great deal at school. And
 
they'll continue taking it as long as it's offered, no
 
matter how proficient they get, you know. My husband
 
speaks two other languages and English and, you know, we
 
feel it's very important to speak different languages.
 
(ES82-Mc/C-C7)
 
Crucial to the success or failure of the Greek School at Holy
 
Trinity-Holy Cross are differences of opinion within the community over
 
definition of the problems of institutionalized language education in the
 
parish today and the best means to resolve them. The future prospects for
 
such education must be assessed both in light of the perceptions of t
 
parishioners and of the parish priest, as well as in view of recent
 
centralization efforts by the Department of Education of the Greek Orthodox
 
Diocese of North and South America.  It i
s principally over the issue of the
 
two Greek school teachers, whom Father Vasilakis says he "inherited,"  t
hat
 
there appears to be some ecclesiastical/ lay disagreement. The disagreement
 
reflects ongoing tension in the community generated by the length of United
 
States residency,  class, educational background, and pedagogical approach
 
of the two teachers —Nichi Jovaras and Themis Kannepoulos —both post-World
 
War II, first-generation immigrants. Jovaras, who came to the United States
 
in the 1
950s and to Birmingham in 1
980, i
s a working-class woman, educated
 
pragmatic, conversational approach may be well suited for elementary-aged
 
)
opular with all of her students or their
 
personal and political differences" with the
 
)
riest, by his account. Kannepoulos, on the other hand, is highly praised
 
by Father Vasilakis, principally for his advanced education (as an
 
engineer), "both in the United States and in Greece," for his "detached
 
political and intellectual approach," as  well as for his emphasis on the
 
classics.
 
While the parish priest highlights the crux of the Greek school matter
 
as personality differences and dislike of particular individuals, his
 
analysis of some of the school's problems also concurs with that of his
 
parishioners, discussed earlier in this report. The geographic spread of the
 
parish members and their difficulties in transporting their children to the
 
school, which is in downtown Birmingham, have already been noted.  In a
 
recent Parish Council meeting over this problem, Father Vasilakis told us
 
that "satellites" —smaller language schools out in the suburban
 
communities--had been considered. The problem for students of choosing
 
between their Greek Orthodox friends and activities and those at the
 
American public/parochial school has likewise been mentioned by several
 
parents. Father Vasilakis also told us that some of the textbooks are
 
outdated and that the curriculum is seriously lacking, a statement with
 
which we agree. The Archdiocese, however, announced in 1980 a long-range
 
plan to centralize and standardize the operation of Greek schools throughout
 
the United States into an eight-year, afternoon program of Greek language

complete series of Greek language texts to supplement those currently
 
available from the Archdiocese. Problems over teacher training and financing
 
must also be resolved i
f this national program of institutionalized language
 
education i
s t
o be successfully implemented nonetheless. Additionally,  the
 
Holy Trinity-Holy Cross parish, as well as the Archdiocese at large, must
 
address the special needs of converts (non-Greeks)  to Orthodoxy, as well as
 
those of new immigrants, in developing Greek school curricula that will
 
serve the varying constituencies that now comprise most Greek Orthodox
 
parishes in this country. Finally, as discussed earlier in this report, the
 
lack of parental and student commitment, with the flagging attendance which
 
results, must also be addressed. Parents of fourth- and fifth-generation
 
Greek-Americans in Birmingham must become committed to the idea o
f Greek
 
school classes for their children, as are the parish's converts and more
 
recent immigrants.

most public and formalized ex
 
by their communities. Althoug
 
institutionalized,  they rest upon educational traditions which are
 
integrated into the ordinary lives of the Birmingham Greek and Lebanese
 
communities. The schools are a supplement to the informal learning that
 
takes place in the home and community on a daily basis. Parish and community
 
organizations represent a middle ground between institutionalized education
 
and unselfconscious enculturation of children by family and community.
 
W 
Planned and casual community social events are one and two steps further
 
removed from explicit  teaching/ learning situations in the language school
 
setting. Even in family life the element of selfconscious teaching of
 
cultural heritage is often very strong. Many of the activities, and
 
sometimes the actual physical environments of Birmingham Greek and Lebanese
 
homes,  are calculated demonstrations of ethnic culture.
 
The following dialogue between two Greek informants,  Georgia Kampakis and
 
Maude Morgan,  illustrates their view of community education.  The Greeks,
 
they say are:
 
Morgan:
 Very traditional people, who, ah,  church,
 
religion and family traditions carried out in the
 
different ages.  I think that's one of the main reasons
 
[for cultural retention],  because our family traditions
 
are so intertwined with our religious traditions--even
 
though, within our church, we have holy traditions,
 
which is altogether different from family traditions,
 
and sometimes people mistake our family traditions for
 
holy traditions.
 
Kampakis:
 I think it begins with the family,  really.
 
And then from there it sort of branches out to the Greek
 
school, and then the church and organizations and things
 
like this.  But it all begins with the parents,  with the
 
mother and the father.  It did with us.
 
Morgan:
 I think now it kind of works more through
 
organizations a little more than it did in our first
 
years  [as a community]. And when I was a little girl, of
 
course,  the Greek school was very important. (This and
 
above interview quotes - ES82-Mc/C-C8)
 
Both women experience an inseparable  relationship between the various
 
settings in which community life and learning take place. For Morgan, the
 
religious and secular cultures are "intertwined." Kampakis sees  t
-he
 
activities of home, Greek school,  and parish organizations as  "brarich(�
 
the same effort.  Interestingly, Morgan notes that, while the component
 
55
 
remain the same as in her girlhood, the emphasis has shifted--the
 
organizations bear more of the burden now;  the Greek school less. The
 
learning continuum i
s unaltered,  but the aspects of culture that are most
 
important are somewhat different as the community becomes a culture of
 
Americans of Greek descent rather than a community of immigrant Greeks.
 
The high points of the Greek and Lebanese
 
year are ethno-religious
 
holidays. I
t i
s during the high holidays such as Easter and saints' days
 
that the mother tongue is employed most extensively in the liturgy. In
 
addition, secular songs are revived and a host of expressions relating to
 
the festivals are used by members otherwise monolingual. The holidays bring
 
forth feasts of ethnic food, native costumes, banks of flowers, home
 
decorations, and ritual objects such as Greek Easter eggs, Catholic and
 
Orthodox. Lenten palms, and the Epiphany holy water for the Greek home
 
altars. Special rituals are performed, both in the church and within
 
extended families and social networks.
 
These holidays are celebrations and simultaneously intragroup
 
exhibitions of ethnic culture. Our informants report an intense level of
 
activity preceding the important holidays. Woman cook, prepare the family
 
home, and decorate the church. Greek men set up the lamb pits. Lebanese men
 
prepare their backyard grilling areas. The choir rehearses. Children
 
f
inalize their dance routines, pageant l
ines, and dress.
 
Both the Maronite and Greek Orthodox communities also put on more
 
public ethno-cultural events. The annual Greek Bazaar attracts participant-s
 
from the entire Birmingham area. Last year 7
,000 meals were served and
 
extern al
 
Uncountable pastries  sold. Young people are trained to lead tours of  the
 
cathedral,  for which they must memorize the Greek terms for all the parts of
 
rhe building and furnishings. While this event is calculated to raise money
 
for the church and to introduce the Greek community to greater Birmingham,
 
i
r  is also an important expression of the Greek communit y's external ethnic
 
customs,  as well as  its deeper values.  Georgia Kampakis,  president of the
 
Philoptochos Society,  the women's organization that works  three days a week
 
for six months to prepare the food for the bazaar says:
 
i think that is one way we keep the Greek customs alive,
 
through that,  even though we don't like to admit  that-
people kind of know us for our food . . . . Why fight it
 
anymore?  It's really something to be proud of. And our
 
customs,  our dances,  too, because our children always do
 
dances . . . . They [non- Greeks]  tell us that
. they like
 
to come because it's a family- oriented festival. And it
 
really is —the kids are all working,  the grandmothers,
 
the mothers,  some grandfathers that are there,  fathers,
 
everybody.  It's a communit y project
.  really,  but it's
 
sponsored by the ladies'  group.  (ES82-Mc/C-C8)
 
The centrality of family and community life is made visible  to outsiders,
 
which in turn reaffirms the community's sense of ethnic integrity.

weekly bingo luncheon. I
t i
s open to the public and at least 300 people of
 
all ages —mostly women, some Lebanese, and many non- Lebanese--played bingo
 
and consumed a lunch of Lebanese meat pies, tabouli salad (made from bulgur
 
wheat, and vegetables), Lebanese spice  cookies, coffee, and iced tea. The
 
Women's Auxiliary of the Cedars  Club prepared the lunch and hosted the
 
affair.
 
Greek and Lebanese community members also participate in a variety of
 
casual and social activities that are culturally related. There are dance
 
clubs at Holy Trinity-Holy Cross, and both Greeks and Lebanese regularly
 
enjoy ethnic music and dance at weddings, festivals, and private parties.
 
Until recently there was a Greek music band of young boys from Holy
 
Trinity-Holy Cross who played for all sorts of events. The St. Elias
 
parishioners hire Arabic musicians from New York or elsewhere for major
 
parish events, sometimes even for weddings. One of the Greek Orthodox men's
 
organizations sponsored a tour to New Orleans this summer to see the
 
traveling art exhibit "In Search of Alexander." Last year a women's group
 
visited the first Greek school in the United States in St. Augustine,
 
Florida. The parish is participating in a national fund-raising drive to
 
restore the school building to its original state and to erect a memorial
 
chapel.
 
All such quasi -organized activities reinforce the cultural
 
heritage that these ethnic communities wish to maintain and transmit. They
 
form the background to the interest in Greek and Arabic school courses and
 
indicate a continuing curiousity about and awareness of their ethnic
 
heritage.
 
Ail o
f our informants can readily provide a long list of examples of
 
y practices stemming f
rom their ethnic background. Not only are they
 
conscious of the many aspects of their cultures which they are passing down
 
through family life, but they also can describe the ways in which they are
 
teaching them. Every informant mentions ethnic music and dancing. All the
 
women mention c
ooking instruction. Josephine Sharbel t
ells of teaching the
 
Lebanese national anthem and other Arabic songs to her children and
 
grandchildren. James Mezrano explains how h
e employs a

tablecloths, and photos of Lebanon and h
-
 family in Birmingham and in
 
Zahle.  In her basement i
s a specia  cooker  7or Lebanese bread;  in the
 
backyard, a permanently installed, triple, gas-fueled grill.
 
Every surface and every wall in the Jovaras home displays Greek
 
artifacts. They range from replicas of ancient vases to postcards of
 
costumed Greek dancers, Aegean seascapes rendered in oil, and homeland
 
statuary. The walls are blue, and even the furniture is upholstered in the
 
Greek national colors. The apartments of Christine Grai
as and Alexandra
 
Bonduris are similar repositories for family and Greek memorabilia. Every
 
home we visited had a large album of photos from trips to the old country
 
conveniently at hand, which was quickly brought forth for our examination.
 
All of these practices reflect conscious statements of ethnic identity
 
and strategies for its maintenance. In the more middle-class homes the
 
objects are carefully chosen, consisting largely of artistic artifacts of
 
old country, high culture. In the more working-class h
omes fine art and
 
crafts are intermixed with mass-produced replicas designed for tourist
 
consumption. Looking beyond the artifacts to less obvious forms of ethnic
 
expression, i
t is important to analyze ways of "being" Greek or Lebanese,

 In  dli
 
homes we visited, except Father Saad's rectory which is a semi-public space,
 
Greek or Arabic was in regular use, at least among the residents themselves.
 
English augmented with Greek when speaking to their daughters. Boohaker
 
and Sharbel both use Arabic with family and friends of their generation, but
 
increasingly make use of English with the younger generation, practically to
 
the exclusion of Lebanese.
 
Beyond simple language choice, we were aware of conversational
 
strategies that were derived from the mother-tongue culture. The Jovarases,
 
like other Greeks we interviewed at the cathedral, tended to speak rapidly,
 
respond quickly to queries, and to interrupt and overlap each other, as well
 
a
s the fieldworkers to a lesser extent. There are scattered remarks about
 
the contentious "nature" of the Greeks, e
.g., "Everybody wanted to be
 
chiefs.  .
 .
 .
 That's the trouble with the Greeks" [
Christine Grammas];
 
"There will always be a lot of conflict" [
Terri Grammas];  "If the Greeks
 
don't have an enemy outside to fight, they just fight with each other"  t
C.
 
W
. Jovarasi. The somewhat loud, quick, and assertive style of discourse we
 
encountered indicates that Greek-language conversational norms unconsciously
 
pervade the community's English as well.
 
By contrast, our t
alks with Lebanese-Americans were far slower in pace.
 
There were long pauses between our questions and their responses. Answers
 
seemed to be careful and deliberate, often clarified with illustrative
 
stories. There were few interruptions, either of us or of each other. While
 
we are not familiar with the discourse styles typical of Arabic conversation
 
among Lebanese,  the differences from our own Anglo-English were pronounced
 
enough to elicit our comments on the Lebanese sense of timing and
 
deliberation.

Perhaps the clearest indicator of family life as an expression of
 
culturally appropriate behavior and cultural values i
s the extreme
 
hospitality with which we were met in these two communities. Father
 
Vasilakjs took it  upon himself to carefully question us about the nature and
 
goals of the research project, selecting those we would  interview based on
 
our initial interview with him. Much to our surprise, his secretary called
 
one day and informed us that a series of interviews had been arranged and we
 
were to come to Holy Trinity-Holy Cross, where the parish members would
 
report to meet with us. Thus our Greek interviews were clearly conducted
 
under the auspices of the parish priest. The interviewees were prompt,
 
interested, and open. Subsequently the Jovarases took it upon themselves to
 
introduce us to "real" Greek life by inviting us to their home for an
 
evening of food, music, and conversation, so that they could share their
 
photo albums, Greek artifacts, and hospitality.
 
In the Lebanese homes we were plied with ethnic specialties. Our most
 
serious interview problem was bringing the meetings to an end. Father Saad,
 
the most apparently de-ethnicized of our Lebanese informants, concluded our
 
interview by remarking that while he does not like St. Elias to be called an
 
ethnic community, and while he does not favor a parish school, he does see
 
certain aspects of Lebanese life as part of Maritonism and intrinsic to
 
parish life. "Well,  the way of life, and the feeling that we have for each
 
other, and the hospitality. There's always been Lebanese hospitality, always
 
been. Always proud of that, and family life."

The Southern Experience
 
Birmingham's Greek and Lebanese communities have several commonalit-
Both are practitioners of Eastern rites of Christianity,
 '
-
very ritualistic and "high church" by American Christi
 
standards —especially for the Deep South, where E
'rotesr w
 :
 -
 
and Pentecostals are in the overwhelming majority.
 
The Greek Orthodox cathedral,  like the Maronite church, functions as
 
something of an outpost for the faith. Holy Trinity-Holy Cross i
s the
 
oldest, largest Greek Orthodox community in Alabama, and still the third
 
largest in the South. St. Elias remains one of only three Maronite
 
communities in the entire Southeast. The two parishes were founded within
 
three years of one another.
 
Immigration began for both communities in the 1
880s, typical for
 
populations from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean. Both the Lebanese
 
and the Greeks emigrated because of declining income from their tiny farms.
 
They were uneducated, with the exception of a few individuals who became key
 
leaders in the parishes and the parish schools. Because of the history of
 
federal immigration and naturalization law, they also grew in parallel ways.
 
Attitudes toward education in both communities are derived f
rom a great
 
sense of pride in their long literary traditions, and both value "the
 
learned man" as teacher and leader. Nicholas Lambrinides, the most admired
 
Greek schoolteacher, and Father Abi-Chedid of St. Elias are characterized by
 
63
 
this term. The Lebanese described themselves as direct descendents of the
 
Phoenicians and the great Arabic cultures preceding Turkish domination. The
 
Greeks look back to the classical Hellenistic tradition.
 
These traditions have implications for language, ethnic school
 
curricula, and pedagogy, as well as for the imperative for cultural
 
preservation and transmission felt by many community members. Elizabeth
 
Boohaker explains why the S
t. Elias parish was united behind Father
 
Abi-Chedid's plan for a Maronite parochial school:
 
They were very interested in helping the pastor get the
 
school started because that's the only way you're going
 
to preserve anything. You'll preserve your heritage and
 
teach your children who they are. And of course, we have
 
the proudest heritage there is. We started civilization.
 
We started learning. We started navigation. We started
 
accounting. Just name it and it was started by the
 
Phoenicians.  (ESS2-Mc/C-C4)

forefathers'  contributions to world culture with at least some brief remark,
 
the Greeks were more confident that their Hellenic culture is well known and
 
respected, at least by educated Americans. Their remarks were intended to
 
show how the classical culture taught as a scholarly subject in America is
 
part of everyday life for Greeks.
 
The Birmingham Greeks and Lebanese also shared a long struggle against
 
overt racism. Greeks and Lebanese were considered non-white in the
 
segregated South. Our interviews contain frequent references to
 
discrimination in employment, housing, and  schools. Here are some
 
representative remarks on the early years:
 
In the South,  there weren't too many ethnic groups. The
 
only [ones were]  Italians, Greeks--very few Greeks,
 
very few Italians--and the Jewish people. And we were
 
looked down,  in fact they called us  "dagos"  in those
 
days  [group laughter]. They did!  They called the
 
Italians and the Greeks  "dagos." And everybody would
 
murmur if they wanted to speak to somebody in their
 
native tongue,  they would go secretly to speak so they
 
won't be ridiculed.  (Christine Grammas - ES82-Mc/C-CIO)
 
[
For the first Lebanese]  it was a very hazardous life
 
because they went out into country and sold to these
 
people who,  back in those days aliens were nil, you
 
know. They were persecuted. And they didn't know the
 
language and might say the wrong word . . . . [The S

Alexandra Bonduris says  that the discrimination eased after World 
Wdr il:
 
It made a lot of our American boys aware, especially
 
here in the South,  because we have a lot of what you
 
would call "redneck" people that
 didn't know anything
 
beyond their own little area . . . and when they were
 
exposed to the farmlands of Italy, England, Italy,
 
Belgium; and so forth and so on,  they realized,  "Hey,
 
this is what I do. These are people, too." I think it
 
Maude Morgan, although she prefers to think things are far better ,
 
[The Greek communit y at first tried to maintain i
ts own
 
separate culture and education because]  I think at first
 
it was because of this anti-  immigrant. I felt this way
 
65
 
when I was in grammar school. And I think the war  [
World
 
War  II]  changed everything.  .
 .
 .  Now let me say this.
 
You know C
. J
., my younger son, because of the
 
prejudices and because it seemed at a certain time, even
 
after the war, that high school children of different
 
nationalities were not helped into getting into, ah, not
 
better positions, and to hold office in some of the
 
c
lubs and these areas in the high school life. And, ah,
 
they were discriminated against. Not the Greek people
 
only, but, like I said before,  the different groups. And
 
he would always say when they'd ask him, or he'd say to
 
me, "I'm an American." Or if anybody asked him he'd say,
 
"Well, I
'm an American. My mother was born in America."
 
You know, he was kind of defensive. (ES82-Mc/C-C9)
 
James Mezrano attributes his aggressive stance toward ethnic heritage and
 
language education to discrimination he and his wife suffered as children
 
n Mississippi growing up [apart from an organized
 
Lebanese community].  .
 .
 .  I know my mother and father
 
did, in this area .
 .
 .  I think they got so tired of
 
defending, having people not understand. Me, I consider
 
it ignorance i
f they do not understand. I just feel like
 
they should look at their own background, you know, who
 
are they to judge me? .
 .
 .  And that's what I tell my
 
children. And I tell them if anyone calls you anything
 
bad--and I tell them what the words are that I think are
 
bad —you have my permission to pick up a brick and hit
 
them. I don't like violence, but they do [
have
 
permission]. And we're in 1982 now and those days are
 
gone, you know, where you have to defend your religion,
 
and your heritage, and your background.(ES82-Mc/C C16)
 
Petrou reports on the harassment of the Birmingham Greeks, including being
 
asked to sit in the black sections of segregated restaurants, being unable
 
to buy houses in desirable residential sections, and a 1
902 Suit  brought
 
against Greek street vendors in which it was argued that their fruit stands
 
were "nuisances" and that they themselves were "abominable and filthy. "35 The
 
Birmingham Greeks responded both by turning inward, i
.e., creating
 
employment in their own businesses and supporting each other in various
 
66
 
services, and by turning outward, trying t
o enhance the image of the Greeks
 
t
o the larger public and actively combating discrimination. In 1922 several
 
men from Holy Trinity travelled to Atlanta to meet with other southern
 
Greeks and decide on a response to discriminatory practices and attacks by
 
the Ku Klux Klan. They returned to found Chapter 3 of AHEPA,  following the
 
lead of the communities in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina.
 
The Lebanese also took care of their own under adverse conditions and
 
struggled t
o alter the racist attitudes and behaviors of those they lived
 
among.  In 1
907 they responded to Alabama Congressman John Burnett's
 
proposals made at a Birmingham civic club that "non-whites" be excluded from
 
immigration. Dr. H. A. Elkourie, a local Lebanese spokesman, wrote a series
 
of articles to local newspapers in which he argued that the Lebanese were
 
"law-abiding,  '
thoroughly Americanized' members of the white race." The
 
Birmingfind study reports that Dr. Elkourie became a national spokesman
 
against the English literacy requirements that were proposed as a basis for
 
excluding Mediterranean immigrants:
 
In 1
911 Dr. Elkourie testified before the United States
 
Congress on behalf of immigrants from Greece and
 
Lebanon. These two nations had given Western
 
Civilization the beginnings of its culture, he said, and
 
it would be a terrible irony for America, the West's
 
most civilized nation, to refuse Greeks and Lebanese a
 
home because they could not read English. "You owe i
t t
o
 
them for no other reason but that of paying a debt."
 
Up until the  1
960s, when the Civil Rights Movement brought a de jure
 
end to segregation, dark-complexioned Greeks and Lebanese might have been
 
challenged when using "white only" services or facilities. Ku Klux Klan •
I:
 
other racist activists continue to use the narrow definitions of "whit
 
Americans that include these peoples among their targets. And the ster
r,
 
67
 
of a monolithic black/white South has yet to be overcome, both within the
 
region and nationally. There is little public consciousness of the variety
 
of peoples who make up the American South outside of the particular locales
 
where European ethnics, Asians, or Native Americans are settled.
 
According to our findings, the Birmingham Greek and Lebanese
 
communities have been remarkably culturally retentive and continue to
 
express strong ethnic identity. Immigrants to the Birmingham communities
 
have observed this as well and, like us, believe that this may be due in
 
part to the unusual social and cultural context in which they make their
 
homes:
 
I think [an important reason] was this community being
 
isolated from the other Greek communities. Because when
 
you go into the Carolinas, Virginia, start moving up
 
north, you can go five miles and meet another Greek
 
community, ten or fifteen miles, you're in another Greek
 
community. So you're not an isolated portion. You're
 
really not isolated in those areas. Here in Birmingham
 
it's very isolated. And I can see that within the
 
people, becoming more clannish, I guess, and it's
 
because of the isolation, and because of your different
 
groups. I think that in other communities that were not
 
isolated, I think it became a lot more cosmopolitan, and
 
also more social, and not so much clannish. (C. W.
 
Jovaras -
 ES82-Mc/C-C12)
 
I think the Birmingham community has always been very
 
aware of itself. I really believe that. And I
've heard
 
compliments about them, nationally, you know, throughout
 
my time-as a priest.  .
 .
 .  They've always stayed close
 
to their traditions, and their identity, and their
 
church; haven't gone too far away and had to pull them
 
back. I mean, they know, they have had that awareness.
 
And I think that's due to the churches which promote
 
that and to the [
Cedarsj Club. (Father Saad -  
ES82-Mc/C-C1)

Recommendations
 
Our f
ieldwork among the Greeks and Lebanese has been very exciting and
 
informative, yet leaves us feeling that we have just begun to scratch the
 
surface of two extremely interesting histories and experiences.
 
classroom education in the context
 
training and maintenance activitie
 
2
.  An approach more informed by t
i
u
 
other disciplines, particularly with regard  to rese
 
methodologies and perspectives which can account fo
 
evolution in both the schools and attitudes towar:
 
education as the  communities chan
 
3
.  A longer, more flexible timelii:
 
schedules of ethnic community classes and cultural
 
events and to permit thoughtful analysis of the dat:i
 
before report writing.
 
Some of the components of ethnic identity lend themselves to r
.
eachin
 
on an institutionalized basis. This is especially true of language. Others
 
can  be learned and reinforced in less formal ways--in the home or in casual
 
or directed community activities. Thus formal and informal education cannot
 
be ranked as more and  l
ess s
erious or important. Their intents--even their
 
intensities--may be the same. The method used is determined by the nature of
 
the content. Third-generation Greek- and Lebanese-American women can teach
 
their children to cook ethnic foods, so they do so. They cannot teach them
 
the Greek or Arabic language, so they look t
o the parish for this service.
 
b9
 
To study the scope and effectiveness of institutionalized ethnic education,
 
we must first know what institutionalized education is intended to
 
supplement.
 
The question of language maintenance has rarely been treated to the careful
 
and thoughtful analysis with which other forms of cultural expression have
 
been approached. Whereas folklorists are very much aware of all the forms
 
and levels of cultural transmission, most linguistic analysis has been one
 
dimensional: a community practices language maintenance if its young people
 
grow up bilingual and it does not if they become monolingual in the
 
mainstream tongue. Language, however, should be seen, as are other
 
components of culture, as an elusive, complex, and sometimes partial
 
phenomenon, expressed in both direct and indirect ways.
 
Although we could only do a rather quick review of the vast literature on
 
ethnicity in the United States, it became clear that the research required
 
more complex definition of ethnic maintenance and identity than suggested
 
the brief project guidelines, if we were to understand the history an'i
 
current attitudes of the Holy Trinity—Holy Cross and St. Elias Communities.
 
In particular, a situational approach based on viable, current definitions
 
of "assimilation" and "integration" would strengthen the conceptualization
 
of the project. The notions of varying rates of assimilation in different
 
aspects of culture, as developed by anthropologists in Africa and as
 
articulated with respect to United States immigration by Mary Sengstoc
 
and of the evolution of ethnicity, ethnic identity, and practice, as
 
70
 
proposed in Faire -37, would contribute significantly to our analysis of
 
cultural maintenance and language retention, and especially to changing
 
community attitudes toward them.
 
The short duration o
f the project was a severe problem for us. Most
 
obviously —because of the parishes'  language school calendars and the late
 
start-up date of the project--it prohibited our visiting  actual language
 
class sessions. We were not able to conduct interviews with a number of
 
informants whom we had contacted and who would have provided a fuller
 
picture of the evolution of the schools. There are large gaps in our
 
information about the Greek schools in particular. Prospective additional
 
informants include young people who attended the classes held in the 1970s,
 
younger adults who were enrolled in the 1
960s, and several middle-aged
 
people who attended Holy Trinity and Holy Cross schools during the t
ime of
 
their separation.
 
We were also unable to attend the major community cultural events at Holy
 
Trinity-Holy Cross and St. Elias because the principle holidays fell
 
outside the research period. Even during our brief period of interviewing we
 
developed sufficient rapport with our informants that we were invited to
 
public and private gatherings. The fieldwork phase was so short, however,
 
that we could not -
participate in many of them.
 
In general, our findings substantiate the hypotheses set out  in  the
 
project guidelines.  Our  suggestions  here  serve  as  refinements  of
 
those guidelines, based on t
his initial r
esearch. We wish  to  strongly urge
 
the continuation of the project, on a longer term and more broadly conceive
 
7
1
 
basis. By understanding the "fit" between school structures, content, and
 
pedagogies, and the cultures which create them, and by studying schools in
 
relation to other culturally supportive community and family activities, we
 
will come to understand the woridview which communities share and are
 
attempting to transmit.
