Welcoming Home Living Beings 
 
 
 
Today, we welcome home beloved Living Beings  
 
 
 
 
 
No one alive today has seen them at home, except in dreams 
 
 
No one we ever met saw them at home, except in dreams 
 
 
 
Yesterday, they were stolen, many generations ago 
 
 
 
Yesterday, they were prisoners in private houses 
 
 
 
Yesterday, they were locked in university basements 
 
 
 
Yesterday, they were poisoned and smothered in museums 
 
 
 
Yesterday, they were branded with numbers and price tags 
 
 
 
Yesterday, they were violated by prying hands and eyes 
 
 
 
Yesterday, they were tortured and deprived of all that nourishes 
 
 
 
Yesterday, they were alone, many generations ago 
 
 
 
Today, we welcome home beloved Living Beings 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They come home to us, their many relatives 
 
 
 
They return after surviving a long, hard war 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They never were meant to be warriors 
 
 
 
They were created with holy purpose 
 
 
 
 
As teachers and doctors  
 
 
 
 
As visionaries and guides 
 
 
 
 
As children and parents 
 
 
 
 
As artists and lovers 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They were created to balance our minds 
 
 
 
 
To settle the Spirits 
 
 
 
 
To solve difficult cases 
 
 
 
 
To make a peaceful way 
 
 
 
 
To make themselves beautiful  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
They were created by Creation and loving human hands 
 
 
 
 
As pots and baskets and boxes 
 
 
 
 
As claws and feathers and teeth 
 
 
 
 
As hides and furs and antlers  
 
 
 
 
As hooves and shells and baleen  
 
 
 
 
As pouches and bundles and gourds 
 
 
 
 
As drums and rattles and bells 
 
 
 
 
As clay and cedar and paint 
 
 
 
 
As grasses and reeds and pollen 
 
 
 
Today, we welcome home beloved Living Beings 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We, their many relatives, have known them all our lives 
 
 
We, their many relatives, have missed them all our lives 
 
 
 
We feed their memory with sacred foods 
 
 
 
We nourish their memory with sacred waters 
 
 
 
We keep them in our circles 
 
 
 
We seek them in the darkest places 
 
 
 
We sing the songs they sing 
 
 
 
We dance the dances they dance 
 
 
 
We pray the prayers they pray 
 
 
 
We dream the dreams they dream 
 
 
 
Tomorrow, after we welcome home our beloved Living Beings 
 
 
 
 
 
It will be as if they never left home or us, their many relatives 
 
 
It will be as if they never left home or us 
 
 
It will be as if they never left  
 
 
It will be as if they never  
 
 
It will be as if 
 
 
It will be 
 
 
It will be as if there were no yesterday 
 
 
It will be tomorrow
