BEAUTIFUL SNOW DROPS. 
As sang by GEORGE ROBINSON. 
BEAUTIFUL snow drops: beautiful snow drops I 
Coming when earth is so drear ; 
Sweetest of blossoms, peeping in gladness. 
Telling summer is near; 
Calm in the tempest, lowly and cheerful, 
Smiling in sunlight and rain ; 
Dear to my childhood, oft have I 
sought thee 
Far over valley and plain. 
CIIORUS. 
Beautiful snow drops! beautiful snow drops! 
Coming when earth is so drear; 
Sweetest of blossoms, peeping in gladness, 
Telling that summer is near. 
Beautiful snow drops! beautiful snow drops I 
Fade not, 0, fade not away ! 
Teach us thy meekness, teach us contentment, 
Whisper that soon 'twill be May. 
Sweetest of mem'ries come to thy bidding, 
Emblems of hearts that we love, 
Cheerful in darkness, hopeful in sadness, 
Constant wherever we rove. 
Beautiful snow drops, etc. 
KISS ME GOOD-NIGHT, 
LITTLE DARLING, 
CINDER RELLA JANE. 
Composed and sung by THOMAS SADLER. 
OH, my soul am broke since I 
am left alone, 
Oh, me, my Cinder Rella Jane, 
Since dis poor little girl, she has no home, 
Oh, Cinder sweet, Cinder, my Cinder Rella Jane, 
But she gone (
music) and left me all alone. 
CHORUS. 
But she's gone, I 
am sure, and I'll never see her more, 
Is my pretty little Cinder Rella Jane. 
She was my first and only love, 
Oh, me, my Cinder Rella Jane; 
She was as bright as de stars up above, 
Oh, Cinder, dear Cinder, my Cinder Rella Jane; 
But she's gone (
music) and left me alone. 
But she's gone, etc. 
I 
will go, yes, I 
will, and I 
will get shipwrecked, 
Ah, me, my Cinder Rella Jane; 
No, I'll go and I'll hang myself by the neck, 
Ah, Cinder, good Cinder,,my Cinder Rella Jane; 
But she's gone, (
music) and left me alone. 
But she's gone, eto. 
As sung by GEO. GALES. 
W ONT you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
Now the song birds have gone to rest, 
As you did in the clays of childhood, 
When you leaned your fond head on my breast ? 
The silvery moon's shining, my darling, 
The little stars twinkle so bright, 
Just give me one kiss ere we part, love; 
Little darling, come, kiss me good-night. 
CHORUS. 
Wont you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
Now the little stars twinkle so bright ? 
Just give me one kiss ere we part, love; 
Little darling, now kiss me good- night. 
Wont you kiss me good-night, little darling, 
And dream a 
sweet dream, love, for me ? 
For you know when we played in the wild wood. 
I 
was always so loving to thee. 
You remember I 
kissed your sweet cheek, love, 
As you placed your sweet hand, dear, in mine, 
And this to me softly did whisper--
Forever, love, I 
will be thine. 
Wont you kiss me, etc. 
Composed and sung by BILLY M CALLISTER. 
I'm dot fattest man vot's 
I 
youst now veigh two hundred pounds; 
In fact I 
am so very stolid 
I 
can hardly get around ; 
I've taken every sort of stuff 
I 
thought would make me thin, 
I 
swallowed shoe tacks und Scotch snuff, 
Und boot legs soaked in gin. 
Yaw, I 
vish I 
don't vos half so fat, 
I 
vould sooner be now like a 
match— 
Thin as de tail of a 
pussy cat, 
Or thinner than a 
scratch. 
There's nothing now I 
can enjoy, 
For yen I 
go to take a 
valk 
If by chance I 
meet a 
poy, 
He says, " McAllister, how is pork ?" 
They bought a 
sausage machine, bran new, 
Und in it I 
vos thrust; 
Before dey could make sausage meat of me 
The old machine did bust. 
Yaw, I 
vish, etc. 
Von day vile dakin home a 
trunk, 
Ill luck, I 
chanced to let it slip, 
Yen it fell upon me all kachunk, 
-Und mashed me like a 
chip. 
They put a 
bellows down my throat. 
Und blew me up so big, 
They burst the buttons off my coat, 
Und made me dance a 
jig. 
Yaw, I 
vish, etc. • 
ONE MORE RIVER TO CROSS. 
Sung by Cues. GOODYEAR, with great success. 
SHOUT, children, you am free, 
One more river to cross; 
Oh, the sogers give you liberty, 
One more river to cross ; 
Oh, four eleven forty four, 
One more river to aross; 
That's the number now that comes no more, 
One more river to cross. 
CHORUS. 
Den a 
wasent that a 
wide river, 
River of Jordan's strand. 
Wide river, one more river to cross. 
Some go to oh.urch for to sing and laugh, 
One more river to cross; 
Dey think they knew all, but didn't know half, 
One more river to cross; 
Some go to church for to sing and shout, 
One more river to cross ; 
In abovit six months dey get kicked out, 
One more river to cross. 
Den a

RIDING IN THE ROW.—{CoNcLuDEDI 
I 
followed her down Rotten Row, 
Rotten Row! Rotten Row 1 
And if her face was pretty, 
I 
determined I 
would know: 
She wore a 
veil, and by her rode 
A 
man with greyish hair— 
Her husband p'rhaps— oh, agony I 
'Twas more than I 
could bear. 
When riding in the Row, &c. 
The pace was fast in Rotten Row, 
Rotten Row! Rotten Row! 
My charmer's horse soon bolted of& 
I 
after it did go; 
She neared some overhanging trees, 
And ere she was aware, 
A branch had caught and pull'd off all 
Her lovely golden hair. 
When riding in the Row, Sto. 
Oh, what a 
scene in Rotten Row, 
Rotten Row! Rotten Row! 
Her golden hair was only false, 
Her own was white as snow; 
Her horse was so amaz'd he stopped, 
And turning round to stare, 
lie saw dishevell'd in the dust 
Her lovely golden hair. 
When riding in the Row, &c. 
I 
hurried off from Rotten Row, 
Rotten Row! Rotten Row! 
Dejected, for my fondest hopes 
Had had a 
crashing blow; 
Since then, the well-known golden rule 
Hast kept me from a 
snare: 
All is not gold that glitters, will 
Apply to golden hair.

CHARLEY THE " MASHER." 
SWELL SONG. 
Words and Music by 
JOSEPTI P. 
SKELLY. 
The music of this song is published by E. 11. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Copyright, 1877, by E. II. 
HARDING. 
I'm Charley the " Masher," a 
swell superfine, 
My garments are made in the latest design, 
I 
wear a 
large diamond and gloves rather small, 
My manner, so graceful, is pleasing to all; 
I'm just like a 
count, or a 
lord, or a 
duke, 
But some vulgar fellows will call me a " fluke ;" 
I'm sure they don't know me, just walk on Broadway, 
And all the young ladies will instantly say— 
CHORUS. 
I'm Charley the " Masher," the gayest of swells 
I 
play the piano and chat with the belles ; 
Wherever I 
go, I'm the girls' " little pet !" 
I'm Charley the " Masher," now don't you forget! 
I 
live at my leisure, do nothing all day, 
At night look for pleasure and go to the play! 
I 
call on Miss Flimsey and. chat for awhile ; 
Dear creature, she's rich, and her pa's only child! 
She's highly accomplished, in fact she's bon ton, 
But there's her big brother, whose name it is John, 
He comes in the parlor and waits till I 
go— 
It's deucedly awkward, but I 
let him know— 
I'm Charley the " Masher," etc. 
I 
wear a 
red rose in my swallow-tail coat, 
And great standing collars encircle my throat ; 
I " hang up" my tailor till fortune is kind ; 
When dress'd up in style many friends I 
can find. 
Of sweet conversation I 
have a 
great flow, 
I'm known ev'rywhere as an excellent beau! 
The wealth and the fashion invite me to dance, 
For Charley the " Masher" their hearts can entrance, 
I'm Charley the " Maher," etc.

I'm always tinking of de dear ole home, 
Down on de Mississippi shore.

FLIPFLAPS FROM TWF: SUNNY SOUTH. 
Written for the W ESLEY& 
As sung by W ELBY and PEARL. 
Ir you will only listen we will sing a 
song 
About the place where we were born, 
And where we were so happy all day long, 
As we worked among the sugar cane and corn, 
And when the dinner horn would sound, 
Then's the time we darks would gather round ; 
And we never can forget all our happy days as yet, 
When we were flipflaps in the sunny South. 
CHORUS. 
And when the dinner horn would sound, 
Then's the time we darks would hover round, 
And we never can forget all our happy days as yet, 
When we were fiipflaps in the sunny South. 
(Dance.) 
Now we've left that dear old place never to return, 
That place we loved so well, 
And we hope we have pleased you all with our little 
turn, 
For more now we cannot tell. 
No more shall we hear the dinner horn, 
To call us all up from the corn ; 
But we never can forget all our happy days as yet, 
When we were flipflaps in the sunny South. 
And when the dinner horn, etc.

IT'S EASY WHEN YOU KNOW HOW IT'S 
DONE. 
Written and composed by JAMES GREEN. 
Sung with immense success by W ELBY and PEARL. 
On, here we are, as you can see, 
Two happy darkeys, light and free, 
Always ready for a 
spree; 
We're dancing all the time, 
And every evening just at dark, 
We go down the street and thro' the park, 
And then you hear the girls remark, 
" 
Oh, what a 
happy couple are they." 
For we're up to all the tricks, as you can see, sir—bang. 
Oh, there never was two darkeys such as we, sir—bang. 
For it's easy when you know how it's done. 
(
dance.) 
We turn fiipflaps and somersets, 
And always do our level best ; 
Now to please you here we try, 
And hope you don't intrude ; 
You'll not see us again to- night, 
For we are in a 
happy plight ; 
Hoping we have pleased you all, 
We bid you all good-night. 
For we are up to all the tricks, do.

think of a - ny thing himself would be a per - feet bore. 
He has servants, tradesmen, carriages, and animals beside, 
From thorough-breds to coach-horses, and hacks to take a 
ride; 
His darling ugly little dogs, his jewelry, his plate-
In fact, he wants for nothing, does this senseless addlepate, 
Who only once, when taken in his yacht beyond the Nore, 
Said that it made him vewy ill, and was a 
perfect bore. 
Cho.-011, yes, a 
perfect bore, a 
horwid nasty bore, 
He said it made him vewy ill, and was a 
perfect bore. 
He has the very best cigars, but never takes a 
puff, 
He lights, and looks at them, and thinks that's quite enough ; 
He seldom takes a 
glass of wine-his friends his bottles drain-
In short, the thing's inanimate, as if it had been slain 
When having ventured on a 
joke, his set were in a 
roar, 
lie thought he never would again, 'twas such a 
perfect bore. 
Cho.-"rwas such a 
perfect bore, oh, weally such a 
bore, 
He said he never would again, %was such a 
perfect bore. 
And thus it matters little where he's led or what is done, 
If that his friends enjoy themselves, he thinks it's jolly fun; 
He has no judgment, can't reflect, appreciate or praise, 
He was unfortunately born, and so must end his days, 
'Without one wholesome thought of joy, past, present, or in store, 
There's nothing in this lovely world, but what's a 
perfect bore, 
CA0.-01), yes, a 
perfect bore, yes, a 
wetched horwid bore, 
There's nothing in this loving world,but what's a 
perfect bore

WAY DO WN IN MAINE. 
Composed and sang by BILLY MCALLISTER. 
IT 
was way down in Maine, 
In a 
place called Kittery, 
It was there I 
met a 
yellow gal, 
So happy light and free ; 
Her eyes were like two codfish balls, 
Her hair like goose's down, 
Her feet they were so terrible big 
They covered up the town. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Twilight in the Park." 
Her father was a 
gay old sport, 
He tried to please her hard, 
He was overseer of lumber 
In a 
Kittery lumber yard; 
Her brother boxed up sardines, 
And oysters by the pint, 
And every time I 
looked at her 
My eyes went out of joint. 
CHORUS. 
DOWN IN DE SHADY GROVE. 
Written by Tnoaris S
LR. 
What kind of shoes does de angels wear 
Down in de shady grove ?

On Jordan's landing I'll soon be,

For I

CHORUS.

Aunt Jemima, etc. 
My old misses promised me,

SOFTLY smiles love's golden summer 
On the valley of the heart, 
Bidding winter, dreary corner 
From the scenes afar, depart I 
Ey'rywhere in radiant glory 
Linger yet the magic hours, 
Whisp'ring still the blissful story 
Over all the paths of flow'rs. 
CHORUS. 
Softly smiles love's golden summer, 
Smiles for you and smiles for me 
Oh I 
gladly, gladly welcome joyous corner, 
Sweet as ever sweet can be, 
Sweet as ever sweet can be. 
Days may leave us, and their going 
Wakens not one sad regret; 
Have we not the sweet foreknowing 
Of the bright hours left us yet ? 
Hope's bright sun still glimmers o'er us, 
Bringing to us fondest bliss; 
Life's one long sweet drean before us; 
What can ever equal this ? 
Softly smiles, etc. 
LITTLE MAUD. 
Oh ! where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
Oh ! where is the voice on the stairway ? 
Oh ! where is the voice in the hall? 
The little short steps on the entry. 
The silvery laugh in the hall ? 
Oh ! where is our dainty, our darling— 
The daintiest darling of all? 
CHORUS. 
Little Maud, Little Maud! 
Oh ! the daintiest darling of all— 
Little Maud, Little .1Iaud ! 
Oh ! the daintiest darling of all 
The peaches are ripe in the garden, 
The apricots ready to fall : 
The blue grapes are dripping their honey 
In sunshine upon the white wall : 
Oh ! where are the lips full of welting, 
That looked up so pouting and red, 
When we dangled the sun-purpled bunches 
Of Isabells over her head ? 
0 Maud, little Maud ! say where are you ? 
She never replies to our call— 
Oh ! where is our dainty, our darling_ 
The daintiest darling of all ? 
Fare thee well then dainty darling little Maud, fare thee 
well ! 
Oh ! the daintiest darling of all— 
In heaven we shall meet thee, dearest darliag little 
Oh ! the daintiest darling of all! 
DON'T PUT THE POOR WORKINGMAN 
DOWN.

Price 35 cents. 
How oft when we hear of misfortune 
Befalling a 
friend or a 
foe, 
If in joy or regrets we express it, 
That's the way of the world you all know. 
I 
thought I 
would speak of a 
subject 
Interesting each village and town, 
That is, iron heeled capital striving 
To put the poor workingman down. 
CHORUS. 
Let capital shake hands with labor, 
Let the poor have the bread that they earn, 
For surely they need every penny, 
Is a 
lesson quite easy to learn. 
Remember the poor love their children, 
So give them a 
smile, not a 
frown, 
Live, and let live, be your motto, 
Oh I 
don't put the poor workingman down. 
(Dance.) 
That money is root of all evil, 
Why all of us likely's found out, 
The richer class think that the poorer 
Should of pleasure know nothing about. 
The honest poor always will labor, 
They don't ask it title or crown, 
Why begrudge them sufficient to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc. 
So now in conclusion I'll mention, 
That life being dear to us all, 
The poorer class must have existence, 
So don't push them close to the wall. 
Now hope that in future the richer 
On the poorer will smile and not frown, 
Who ask but enough just to live on, 
Don't put the poor workingman down. 
Let capital, etc.

HUMBUG IS ALL THE GO. 
As Sung by NED TURNER. 
I've got a 
song, you'll find it's new, 
It's one to suit the times, sirs; 
The subject must be known to you, 
Who listen to my rhymes, sirs. 
I 
don't intend to flatter you, 
Your censure I 
defy it : 
You're all a 
set of humbugs, 
And you know you can't deny it. 
Yes, sir-ee, 
Humbug now is all the go, 
Oh, yes, sir-ee. 
You'll often in the papers see, 
(It's quite the rage of late, sirs ;) 
A tender maiden, young and free, 
Advertise for a 
mate, sirs. 
A gay old brick an answer sends, 
They soon appoint a 
meeting; 
She bleeds him well, and there it ends, 
By humbug he is beaten. 
Yes, sir-ee, 
Now folks should never more grow ill, 
The doctors are so clever ; 
They've patent bitters, draughts and pills, 
To make you live forever ; 
They- advise you to swallow all their stuff', 
And never mind expense, sir ; 
But don't you be so jolly green, 
They are humbugs— nothing else, sir. 
Yes, sir-ee, &c. 
There's dainty damsels flitting round, 
lit satin, silks and laces ; 
With cotton busts and bustles too, 
And paint upon their faces. 
They hook a 
fiat, and are married, 
Then spend their husbands cash, sir; 
lie finds that he's been humbugged, 
She has sweetly sucked him in, sir. 
Yes, sir-ee, ctc.

Fairest of these lovely creatures, 
Dearest of them all to me, 
Is my charming blue-eyed beauty, 
Darling little Laura Lee. 
Some have rosy cheeks we covet, 
Others teeth of pearly white, 
And we often sing in praising 
Flowing ringlets dark or light ; 
There are dimples most bewitching, 
Features beautiful to see, 
And these charms are all embodied 
In my darling Laura Lee. 
Fairest of these, etc. 
There is beauty in her forehead, 
Splendor in her bright blue eyes, 
And her voice is far the sweetest 
Ever heard beneath the skies ; 
Sweetest of all earthly treasures 
Ever sent to comfort me, 
Is my charming blue-eyed beauty, 
Darling little Laura Lee. 
Fairest of these, etc.

TSB YOUNG MAN FAIR, WITH. CURLY 
IIAIR. 
AT
E:—" Under the willow allele sleeping." 
Words by H. J. WurniAmr. 
While walking one morning in Regent Street, 
A handsome young fellow I 
chimed to meet, 
He walk'd up to me with a 
smile so sweet, 
And these words to rue then did say : 
" 
My charmer, you're handsome beyond a 
doubt, 
Pray raise that thick fall, Miss, and do not pout, 
Then, perhaps. on next Sunday, I'll take you out, 
To Greenwich we'll go for the day." 
CHORUS. 
Pair, fair, with curly hair, 
Beard and moustache did alike compare, 
He look'd like an Emperor, I 
declare, 
Beautiful, beautiful swell. 
He promised to wed, and his name was Brown, 
And he'd a 
nice villa in Camden town, 
Then ask'd if I 
hindly could lend a " crown," 
And freely of course I 
complied. 
And when he obtained it, he said: 
" 
My dear, I'm sorry to leave you, but must, I 
fear, 
But to- morrow, at eight. I 
will meet you hero," 
Then hasten'd away from my side. 
Fairofair, eec. 
Now, when he'd departed I 
felt so lone, 
For dearly I 
loved that young man, I'll own, 
Such hearty affection for me he'd shown, 
I 
never thought he would prove untrue. 
I 
hasten'd to where we'd arranged to meet. 
My heart, like a 
pendulum, quick did beat, 
I 
patiently paced up and down the street, 
But still he was nowhere in view I 
Fair, fair, &c. 
Two hours I 
waited, and heard " Big Ben," 
With sonorous tones, strike the hour often, 
He came not, I 
called him the basest of men, 
And nothing my passion could quell. 
The Holborn Casino I 
chanc'd to pass, 
And just going in there, as bold as brass, 
Mauve gloves on his hands, on each arm a 
lass, 
I 
saw this mauceuvering swell! 
Fair, fair, Sze. 
Of course to my feelings I 
gave free vent, 
On " showing him up" I 
was fully bent, 
I 
asked for the five shillings that I'd lent. 
When into deep laughter he fell. 
I 
said for the money I 
would him snip, 
His ting-ers be snapped and he answered " Pooh!" 
You can't, for you haven't an "I. 0. U." 
Oh I 
swindling, tho' handsome young swell! 
Fair, fair, &o.

SPEAK, oh! speak to me again, 
Cause me not unwonted pain; 
Words of love should never cease 
When they bring such heartfelt peace; 
Let me bask within thy smile, 
Let thy songs my heart beguile. 
Let me bask within thy smile, 
Let thy songs my heart beguile; 
Cause me not unwonted pain, 
Let me hear thy voice again. 
Summer will not always last, 
Noon of life will soon be past; 
Like the flow'rs too must fade— 
Pass from sunshine into shade ; 
Wither like the leaves that fall, 
And the earth encompass all I 
Wither like the leaves that fall, 
And the earth encompass all I
. 
Cause me not unwonted pain, 
Let me hear thee speak again. 
As the sun with roseate rays 
Brightly tints the dying days— 
As the moon with soften 'd 
beam 
Silvers up the limpid stream, 
Let thine eyes my radiance be, 
Oh! reflect thy soul on me ! 
Let thine eyes my radiance be, 
Oh I 
reflect thy soul on me! 
Cause me not unwonted pain— 
Ah! ! I 
hear thee speak again!

OLD SNOOZER BEN. 
I'va been walking around this big city, 
I'm so tired I 
scarcely can jog, 
I 
was hoping some friend would take pity, 
And treat me to one glass of grog. 
Whenever I 
go in a 
gin mill, 
They order me out there and then, 
And say that Pm drunk and had my fill, 
And they've nicknamed me Old Snoozer Bea, 
Once I 
was in good circumstances, 
And had hosts of friends among men, 
But I 
lost all by taking the chances, 
And bad luck struck Old Snoozer Ben. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
I'm looking for some friends to come, 
It's provoking—I'm choking, 
I'm shaking for one glass of rum. 
When I 
was a 
respectable body, 
Then friends would meet me at the door, 
And insist on my having a 
toddy, 
But they never do so any more, 
They helped me to spend all my money, 
As they had many poor fools they meet. 
But now- a- days they all think it funny, 
To help boot me out in the street. 
(1)

OLD ONOOZER BEN.—Continued. 
But yet it's the way of the times now, 
I've noticed it time and again, 
If a 
man's down and ain't any dimes now, 
He's as bad off as Old Snoozer Ben. 
CHORUS. 
I'm waiting—I'm waiting, 
In hopes that some old friend I'd meet, 
Only think now—one drink now, 
Can I 
find no friend that will stand treat ? 
I 
feel that I'm fast growing weaker, 
If only I 
had just a 
drop. 
My poor wife, oh ! how can I 
seek her ? 
Oh rum— rum, oh ! why can't I 
stop ? 
What figures are those that are near me, 
It's the forms of my poor wife and child, 
They are starving at home—oh! dear me, 
Give me brandy or I 
shall go wild. 
But no, I 
must banish this madness, 
And try to be a 
man among men, 
Our hearts filled with joy and with gladne.s, 
I 
never will get drunk again. 
CHORUS. 
I 
must bear It—I 
swear it, 
No liquor for me e'er again, 
No shrinking—or drinking, 
So pattern from Old Snoozer Ben.

A vie-timized young man. 
When first I 
went out to a 
ball, I 
met a 
lady fair, 
She'd had some words with her young man, and he likewise was 
there; [immense, 
She danced with me throughout the night, and, thought the chance 
To aggravate and jealous make her chap at my expense; 
When going home he knocked me down, and then away he ran, 
And left me in the gutter there, a. victimized young man. 
Near Oxford street a 
girl to me said, " James, how do you do I" 
I 
said," You have th' advantage, miss, for I 
really don't know you." 
She then commenced to scream aloud, and seem'd with frenzy 
wild, [child I" 
Saying, " Wretch, you have deserted me, and where's the darling 
And there I 
like a 
dummy stood, for satisfied I 
am, 
I 
knew her not, I 
felt I 
wa:, a 
victimized young man. 
A 
crowd bad now collected round, and all were crying shame! 
My hat was smash'd, my coat was torn before a 
policeman came. 
She said, " That is my husband, sir, who leaves me starving ...ere," 
The Bobby said, " Oh I 
man and wife, then I 
shan't interfere." 
When she had turn'd her back to speak, like a 
deer away I 
ran, 
The boys all following pelting me, a 
victimized young man. 
I 
refuge took behind a 
stall not far from Drury Lane, 
The mud and stones about me fell, and shower'd down like rain 
It grew so hot that out I 
got, and once more beat retreat, 
Half mad and smother'd o'er with mud, to the baths in Endell 
Street; 
Like lightning through the door I 
flash'd, and didn't stop to scan 
The money-taker, for I 
felt, a 
victimized young man.. 
Up-stairs I 
rushed, with worry flush'd, and didn't stop to read 
Directions as where I 
should go, I 
was too glad to be freed 
From the boys outside who would deride and follow in my path, 
When all at once I 
found myself in the ladies' swimming bath; 
Some laugh'd, some scream'd, and all like ducks into the water ran, 
And splash'd me till I 
was wet through, a 
victimized young man. 
I 
know not whether they or I 
at first was most surprised, 
I 
very soon was bundled out, and of course apologized; 
An explanation settled all, I 
wash'd and brush'd my clothes, 
Then bail'd a 
cab, and hurried home much better you'll suppose 
I 
never now go out alone for satisfied I 
am, 
That if I 
do I'm sure to be, a 
victimized young man. 
Written by Wm. B. CAVANAGH. 
Snug by BILLY CARTER. 
Bill Cotton a 
vocalist young and ambitions, 
Whose muse was decidedly good and propitious, 
Hla sizli'd for high honors and tuned his banjo, 
And nightly mew plaudits from the gods at the show. 
The fair sex admired him, he made conquests a 
score, 
The artists, too, laughed at his its o'er and o'er, 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
CHORUS. 
The ballet girls adored him and stood in the wings, 
While he tuned his banjo and said funny things; 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills,. 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
His fame kept increasing throughout all the land, 
And scores of new friends he shook by the hand, 
The dailies too praised him in articles long, 
For his manipulations of banjo and song. 
Then resolving to be in the profession a 
beau, 
He called on a 
tailor for a 
suit comme-il faut, 
But the snip would not trust him or measure his limbs, 
For his name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, &c. 
He left his cheap lodgings, to a 
hotel did go, 
Determined to cut all aequaintances low, 
For to mix in high circles the elite of his clan, 
Was the principal hobby of this soaring young man. 
But the landlord being present gave hint a 
sly glance. 
And politely demanded his board in advance, 
Get a 
line from the manager to secure us from ills, 
For your name isn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, &c. 
A bewitching brunette clid his senses entrance, 
ills heart was a 
slave to her enraptured glance, 
He proposed, was refused, so to end all his woe, 
Packed his things up at night, bade adieu to the show. 
And now o'er the sea in far distant climes. 
He wanders on foot plays his banjo and rhymes, 
For his country or home his heart never thrills, 
For his name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, &o. 
TURKEY RHUBARB. 
I 
came here from Turkey because I'd been told, 
The ladies were handsome, so thought I'd be bold; 
Of cash I 
had plenty, and thought to do well, 
Ne'er tireaining that I, Turkey Rhubarb would sell. 
Now I, like the Sultan, the ladies adore, 
So thought I'd hint copy and marry a 
score ; 
I 
only succeeded ill marrying. ten, 
And they have all bolted with some other men. 
CHORUS. 
Turkey rhubarb, Turkey rhubarb, Turkey rhubarb I 
sell, 
I 
came here from Turkey to make you all well ; 
Perhaps you dcn't know me, but my name is Dan, 
I 
am tie celebrated Tut key rhubarb man. 
One of my wives " rounded," declar'd me an elf, 
Said she'd have a 
husband, and all to herself ; 
I 
told her I 
loy'd her, but it was no go, 
She eall'd a 
policeman, and let lihn to know ; 
He look'd with amazement, said I'd got a " cheek," 
And straightway he walked me before the old " beak," 
Who said I'd committed a 
stupendous crime, 
To prison he sent me, and for it long time. 
Turkey rhubarb, &c. 
At the trial I 
pleaded 1 
knew not the law, 
My counsel he tried hard to find out a 
flaw, 
And the hard-hearted iudge, in spite of my grief, 
Said that a 
bigamist was worse than a 
thief; 
A verdict of guilty the jury soon found, 
Alia then I 
fell senseless right on to the ground; 
I 
was doom'd in a 
jail tea years to remain, 
And not see my dear wives, no, not once again. 
Turkey rhubarb, &c. 
You've heard all my troubles, I 
hope you won't laugh, 
Nor tell other tie ple, or else they may chaff; 
Advice I'll now give to all who would roam, 
Don't you do abroad what you would at home; 
Or else when in trouble, perhaps innocent quite, 
All the pity you'll get will be " Sery'd you well right I" 
My love for the ladies was my only sin, 
l'ci do it again, but I've not got the tin. 
Turkey rhubarb, &c.

That nothing you can say or do 
Will make this fellow fret; 
No matter what occurs to me, 
I

If troubles come, I

It's all the same to Sam.

If troubles come, I 
snap my thumb, 
It's all the same to Sam. 
I 
used to mope, and never hope 
But sigh and mope again, 
But now I 
find an even mind 
Will best resist the pain; 
I 
like to speak out what I 
mean, 
And never care to sham, 
I 
don't pretend to foe or friend, 
It's all the same to Sam. 
It's all the same, &e. 
A pretty girl put in a 
whirl 
My brain, some years ago ; 
And she thought I 
should surely die 
Because she answered " No I" 
But I

Though yours I

Make no mistake, my heart won't break,

It's all the same, dce.

youth to the wars ran off because 
I 
wouldn't his love receive; 
He asked me once and " no," 
The dunce could not see was a

Oh! it's nice to make believe, 
So nice to 'take believe, 
Men ne'er guess that no means yes; 
Oh! a

To squeeze out a 
furtive tear, 
When somebody nice is near, 
There's somebody behind us so, 
May softly stolen embrace achieve, 
Shrieking alarms caught in his arms 
We faint—that is, we make believe. 
Oh! it's nice to make believe 
So nice to make believe,

Oh! a

SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS—DRESSED ALIKE. 
[Scene, a 
street. 
Enter AUGUSTUS, who looks around as if 
expecting some one. 
He is dressed as a 
fop.] 
AUGUSTUS.—I 
wonder where she can he? She made an ap-
pointment to meet me here precisely at eight. 
It's past that 
now. I 
wonder if she will disappoint me? No; I 
don't be-
lieve she will, for I 
flatter myself I 
have won that palpitating 
little heart of hers. 
Oh, she's a 
beauty 
Nobody else stands 
a 
show to win her from me. 
Why, she wouldn't look at 
another chap. 
I'm her only beau. 
Where can she be? 
Girls 
are always late. 
Hello! I 
wonder who this is? 
He ooks 
enough like me to be my twin. 
[Enter ADOLPHUS.] 
ADOLPHUS. — She said she'd be here at eight. 
1' hope she's 
not going to disappoint. 
I 
never knew her to break her 
promise. 
Oh, she's just the sweetest little angel out of para-
dise! 
Such eyes-! Such hair! 
And then she loves me so. 
She calls me pet and sugar-plum, and all sweet cognomens 
like these. 
Then the best of it is she won't even look at any 
other fellow. 
[Sees AuousTus.] 
Hello! [Aside.] I 
wonder 
what he's dodging around here for. 
Why, he's got into my 
clothes. 
I'll accost his royal highness. 
How do you do, 
stranger ? 
AUGUSTITS.—I'm lively, thank you. 
What's the news? 
ADOLPHITS.-011, nothing. 
You didn't happen to see a 
pretty little gal passing by here, did you? 
AUGUSTUS.—What sort of a 
gal ? 
Tall, short, slim, stout, or 
otherwise? 
ADOLPHUS. — Well, I 
guess otherwise. 
AUGUSTUS.—No. I 
was looking for a 
little gal myself. 
ADOLPHUS.—Yes; what kind of a 
looking gal is she? 
AUGUSTUS. — Oh, she's not very tall, dark eyes, lovely ring. 
lets, dimpled chin, and pearly teeth. 
She was to meet me 
here at eight. 
ADOLPHUS (
aside).—1 
begin to smell a 
mice. 
AUGUSTUS.—She never failed to keep her appointment

before. I 
guess she'll come along soon. 
[Begins to draw on 
gloves.] 
ADOLPHUS (draws on gloves of the same color).—I 
guess 
she'll be here. 
What's your gal's name? 
AUGUSTUS.—Melinda Jane. 
ADOLPHUS.-0 heavens I 
that's my gal's name! 
AUGUSTUS. —Your gal's name? Do you mean to say you 
know my Melinda Jane? 
ADOLPHUS.— Your Melinda Jane ? 
AUGUSTUS.—Yes; my Melinda Jane! 
ADOLPHUS.—Why, I 
guess not; she's going to meet me 
here at eight. 
AUGUSTUS.—She promised to meet me, too 
ADOLPHUS.—Oh, I 
guess not! 
AuousTus.—Oh, I 
guess yes I 
ADOLPHUS.—Oh, no! 
AUGUSTUS.—On, yes! 
ADOLPHUS.—She says I'm her only beau. 
AuousTus.—She says she'll expire for me. 
ADOLPHUS.—Oh, go 'way, child. 
AUGUSTUS.—Shrimp, depart I 
ADOLPHUS.—She's my gal, anyhow. 
AUGUSTUS.—I 
say she's my gal.

I 
fell in love with a 
pretty girl, 
A. few short years ago. 
All sorts of weather, hail or rain, 
To court her I 
would go ; 
I'd long and sigh with love until 
'Trani time to be ax% ay, 
And When I 
asked a 
parting kiss, 
She always used to say: 
ctIORUS. 
Oh, mother says I 
mustn't, mother says I 
mustn't T 
Oh, George. please. George, not just yet awhile; 
Mother says I 
mustn't, mother says 1 
mustn't 1 
Oh, George, don't, George, not just yet. 
I 's 
waiting" kept, at last, one day, 
I 
thought I'd know my fate, 
I 
sunk upon my knees in quite 
An agonizing state; 
" 
Selina, say you'll have your Gvcorge, 
And when shall we be wed 1" 
I 
longed to hear my love's reply. 
And this is what she said— 
Spoken—Well, George, dear, you're very kind, but we could never 
live on two hundred a 
year, so until you are worth at least five 
hundred per annum, darling— 
Mother Pays 1 
constn't, &IL 
From then I 
went to work, by Jove I 
I 
left no stone unturned, 
Until five hundred pounds a 
year. 
At last I 
really earned ; 
Selina heard bow things had chanced, 
And when we met ope day, 
Sbe seemed so pleasant, and at last 
She lovingly did say — 
Spoken—You remember, George, dear, what I 
saia Veva ;on asked 
me some time age,—well, George, dear, as you have so inaprvved 
circumstances, suppose you ask me now, Georgy. Porgey, darlioat 
all, what say 
Well, said I, upon consideration you're very kind, but— 
Mother says I 
mustn't, dee. 
Give me the girl who loves a 
man, 
And loves him for himself, 
Whose first consideration is, not 
What he's worth in pelf: 
All sordid-minded damsels, who 
May worship golden dross, 
May they be old maids till they die, 
And we'll never feel their loss— 
Spoken—So ladies who don't want to be old maids, mind you, dOsal 
Once too often say— 
Mother says I 
mustn't. &P.

SKEIAT, 
I 
TOOK my love one ev'ning, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control; 
I 
wanted to tell her 
low dearly I 
adored her, 
But oh, she would not listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly implored her; 
Oh, love, oh, love, why don't you heed me I 
How can you treat me so 1 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain; 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
CHORUS. 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Yes, you are awful ; 
Your like I 
ne'er did see ; 
Oh, ain't you awful ; 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me, you're horrid ; 
Why don't you let me be'? 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to hear her 
Say yes, and ease my mind ; 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention; 
She said mamma would scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention; 
" 
Come, love," I 
cried, " we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind." 
" 
Oh, no, oh, no," she said, 
" 
Don't ask me now to wed; 
What would the people say 
If we should run away 7" 
Oh, ain't you awful, etc. 
(1) 
AIN'T YOU AWFUL.—Continued. 
She talked on useless matters, 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
When silent she should be; 
I 
begged her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me; 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said— 
Oh, ain't you awful, etc. 
A HANDFUL OF TURF. 
As sung by ED 
BURTON. 
ITS sailing I 
am at the dawn of the day 
To my brother that's over the sea, 
And it's little I 
care for my life anywhere, 
For ' tis breaking my poor heart will be ; 
But a 
treasure I 
take for old Ireland's sake, 
And I'll pledge all belonging above, 
'Tis a 
handful of turf from the land of me birth, 
From the heart of the country I 
love. 
(Repeat last two lines.) 
Then won't that poor lad in his exile be glad, 
When he sees the bright present I 
bring '1 
And won't then the flowers in their elegant bowers 
Breathe forth the perfume of spring 7 
Oh, Erin, Machree though it's parted we'll be, 
'Tis a 
blessing I 
leave on your shore, 
Though your mountains and streams I 
will see in my 
dreams, 
Till I 
cross to old Ireland once more.

Oh I 
Mollie, darling, the anchor is weighed, 
The ship is now ready to sail o'er the sea, 
Each moment is precious and time trill not wait, 
Oh! Mollie my treasure do listen to me; 
You're going far away from kindred and friends, 
Ott to the land that is far o'er the foam, 
We've no one but you to gladden our hearts 
Don't leave us, Mollie, sweet light of our home. 
CHORUS. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, and leave us alone, 
For dreary our beautiful home then will be. 
We've uo one to care for but you, Mollie dear, 
Don't leave us, darling. Oh ! listen to me. 
Oh! Mollie, my darling, your father is ill, 
But still he has come down to see you depart. 
He stands by your side in our sorrow and pain, 
And tears tell the anguish that lies in his heart,. 
011! come to my arms, let me fold you again, 
Close to the heart that is throbbing for thee, 
Remember the days when I 
sang you to sleep, 
Don't leave us, Mollie, to cross the blue sea. 
Don't cross the sea, Mollie, &c. 
Oh I 
Mollie, my darling, say what will you do, 
Alone in a 
land were but strangers abide, 
No kind words you'll hear of advice, Mollie dear, 
But ah ! many evils will lurk at your side; 
Let me kiss you, perhaps for the last time on earth,• 
For we are old, and our days am but few, 
There's tears in your eyes, I 
see you'll not go— 
Ileav'n pour sweet blessings, dear Mollie, on you.' 
Don't cross the flea, Mollie, &c.

Do not let it pass unheeding, 
Whisper softly, Eloise.

Shall rest on this hour—kiss, kiss me again.

Has held but one passion— oh! kiss me again. 
Don't shrink, Lte.

Close, close, to thee, dearest, untrammeled and free, 
To breathe out my passion, and call thee mine own, 
Ere I

meeting and parting—kiss, kiss me again. 
Don't shrink, &c. 
Oh! kiss me again— this sad world of ours, 
O'er OLIT pathway has strown More of thorns than of flowers 
Let thy lips' gentle pressure thrill to my heart's core, 
Let our breath and our beings but mingle once more; 
For soon these wild throbbings of heart and of brain 
Will be stilled in death's silence—then kiss me again. 
Don't shrink, ite,

am late, 
But are always watching for me, 
Waiting till I 
shut the gate ; 
And when I 
have cross'd the threshold, 
They will beam with rays of joy, 
And the rogue will try to tell me 
That he is my darling boy. 
Little bright eyes, etc. 
Little bright eyes at the window 
Waiting for a 
father's smile, 
Little do you know the feelings, 
Or the hearts you may beguile; 
In the future dim before you, 
Care and trouble may be thine, 
And the tears of woe may glisten 
Where contentment used to shine.

ANGEL voices sweet and fair 
Call me, mother, call me there, 
To that land beyond the skies 
Where the golden hills arise ; 
Gently they are calling me, 
With a 
most delightful glee, 
And they whisper in my ear 
Words of comfort, hope, and cheer. 
CHORUS. 
Angel voices sweet and fair. 
Call me, mother, call me there, 
To that land beyond the skies 
Where the golden hills arise. 
Angel voices at my head 
Bid me leave my snowy bed, 
And ascend with them above 
To the land of peace and love; 
Angels kneeling at my feet 
Sing their anthems soft and sweet, 
And they take me by the hand, 
Pointing to that better land. 
Angel voices, etc. 
Angel voices sweet and fair 
Softly fall upon the air. 
And in groups they stand and wait 
Just aside of heaven's gate ; 
Dearest mother, do not sigh 
When they take me to the sky, 
And beyond the realms of blue, 
Mother, I 
will wait for you.

I 
AM a 
man of easy mind, 
I 
know no care or woe, 
make myself agreeable 
Wherever I 
may go; 
My friends I 
count them by thy score— 
The reason I 
will tell, 
always do things properly, 
And consequently well. 
That's the proper caper, 
When things are done 
That's the proper caper, 
True in all you do, for 
that's the proper caper; 
in proper style, I 
always like to say, 
that's the proper caper; be fair and 
that's the proper way. 
The other day I 
met a 
friend, 
A very nice young man ; 
I 
asked him could he dine with me ; 
Of course he said, 
We dined and wined in sumptuous style 
And smoked our Henry Clays ; 
And when we parted he remarked, 
My friend, I 
like your ways. 
That's the proper caper, etc. 
My sweetheart is a 
pretty girl, 
So lovely and so fair; 
Some day she's going to marry me, 
My future life to share ; 
A 
rich young man was after her. 
But his love she could not see 
She told him he was not the thing, 
She rather fancied me. 
That's the proper caper, etc.

THERE'S a 
land of golden glory 
Waiting for repentant ones, 
And its hills are ever radiant 
With the light of many suns; 
Once within its crystal portals, 
We shall meet to part no more; 
Are we ready for the journey 
Just beyond the other shore ? 
CHORUS. 
Once within its crystal portals 
We shall meet to part no more; 
Are we ready for the journey 
Just beyond the other shore ? 
Precious loved ones now are waiting, 
Will you meet them over there ? 
Do not wait for other warning 
Ere you seek that Eden fair; 
In the home that's far above us 
Love in plenty is in store, 
And there is a 
safety harbor 
Just beyond the other shore. 
Once within, etc. 
Satan tells you not to hurry 
From the fields of sin and shame— 
Tells you that you must not worship 
God, the dear Redeemer's name; 
Do not heed his cunning pleading, 
Listen to his words no more, 
But be ready for the journey 
Just beyond the other shore. 
Once within, etc.

OUR marriage bells are ringing,

The present hour is bringing 
Sweet joy and ecstasy ; 
For she whom I

Come, my darling, come and haste to me, 
Do not tarry, love, I

Dost thou hear the wedding bells ? 
Joyous peals they ring for thee; 
What welcome sounds their music tells— 
I 
fondly wait for thee. 
What care I 
for the world's frowns, 
With the loved one by my side ? 
For through its ups and downs 
Well breast life's stormy tide; 
And though the ctitrent bears us on 
From all t

My love will ever be as strong

Written and composed by W. H. 
DELEIIANTY. and sung by DELEGANTY

I'm happy as the day is 
My mind is never easy, 
No matter whether right or wrong, 
You must not think me rude ; 
For love, it is the burden of my song, 
With joy I'm almost crazy, 
And if perchance I 
sing or fiance, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if perchance I 
sing or dance, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude.

When I 
heard the music sweet, 
My heart with joy filled over, 
And I 
couldn't keep my feet. 
So keep the music ringing, 
As it makes me feel so good; 
And if I 
make one little break, 
You must not think me rude. 
And if I 
make one little break, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
At a 
fancy ball the other night, 
Myself and little Daisy, 
We kept it up till broad daylight, 
We felt so awful good; 
And Daisy looked so fair and bright 
She set the men all crazy, 
And when they'd ask her for to dance, 
She'd say, " I 
wish I 
could," 
Then I 
would say, in a 
careless way, 
I 
hope I 
don't intrude. 
Oh, dear, don't you wish, etc. 
Oh, the happy day is drawino• near 
When I

I 
Am a 
gay and dashing belle, 
As you are all aware, 
I 
love to dress and cut a

With me none can compare; 
I'm always cheerful, light and gay, 
My heart is never sad, 
I 
strive to cast dull care away, 
To keep my spirits glad. 
CHORDS. 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay young belle, 
And well I 
love to cut a 
swell ; 
Among the boys, and girls as well, 
I 
am called the Female Swell. 
The other day I 
caught a 
beau, 
He offered me his arm, 
lie talked so sweet, we walked so slow, 
lie worshipped every charm; 
lie spoke his heartfelt love for me 
In words I 
cannot tell. 
"Pray stop," said I, " for don't you see 
That Pm the Female Swell." 
Oh, yes, I 
am a 
gay, etes. 
As I 
walk down the crowded street 
I 
toss my flowing curls, 
And smile on every gent I 
meet ; 
I'm envied by the girls, 
The little dears they are so shy, 
Their thoughts they dare not tell, 
They are afraid to wink so sly, 
Like me, the Female Swell. •

Copyright, 1875, by FREDERICK BLUME. 
W ELL, there now, did you ever 1 
Ma says I'm dreadful bold; 
Because when men come courting, 
Pm not reserv'd or cold; 
Now, gents, pray tell me, would you have me 
Make a 
face that's wry '? 
Or when you ask me once to kiss you, 
Like a 
fool to cry'? 
SPOICEN,—No, no! 
I'm sure you would rather I'd say— 
CHORUS. 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me, 
Bless me, Bob, don't be so shy ; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me! 
Once more, only, love, to try; 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me! 
'Tis the height of true love's bliss, 
Keep on kissing me, keep on kissing me I 
No joy equals love's fond kiss. 
Bob says not to mind mother, 
When she was young like me 
She ne'er thought men a 
bother, 
Or married would not be; 
And so I 
thought if men would follow, 
l'd not say them nay; 
Nor for my mother, or any other, 
Bid them turn away. 
SPorcE14.—But I've made up my mind that when the rigt 
one comes along I'll say— 
Keep on kissing, etc. 
I 
think that Bob means business, 
Tho' not much yet he's said; 
But truly from his actions, 
I 
think he means to wed; 
Now should he ask me if 
have him, 
I'll not bid him wait, 
And say the sea holds plenty fishes, 
For oft we lose our bait. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, yes! I 
tell you, these giddy girls who kee) 
saying, " There's just as good fish in the sea as ever wer, 
caught!" 
They forget that sometimes they lose their bait 
Not for me! 
Oh, no! 
I'll continue saying— 
Keep on kissing, etc.

I NOW! 
Is the time to shun disease! 
Have you shooting pains in the breast, back and limbs I 
Do you have a 
bad taste in your mouth 7 
Do pimples and blotches disfigure your complexion I 
Do you have dull or racking pains in your head ? 
Do you have sleepless nights 
and a 
poor appetite 
Have you a 
weary, wasted feeling I 
Do you feel tired of living at times ? 
If you have all, or any of these feelings and symptoms, you 
are suffering from indigestion, biliousness, and coming fever 
Your liver wants stirring up and cleansing. 
There is but one certain, sure, unfailing cure for 
all these ailings. 
The great remedy is 
MERLIN'S HEALTH GRANULES. 
Take them as directed and you may laugh at disease. 
You 
will have killed its seeds.
