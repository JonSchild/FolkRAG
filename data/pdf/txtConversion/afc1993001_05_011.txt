Records show that the Czech School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has
 
conducted classes in Czech language and culture for school age
 
children for over one hundred and twelve years.  Students in the
 
1982 session included a family that is the fourth generation to
 
attend the Czech School.
 
The first Czech fam iies set iea in  l
-
-e '
Je1ar Ra
ds area in
 
the early 1850 1s, before the city was even established.  It was
 
natural for these people to set up their own native language school
 
almost immediately, because they came from a land that had a long
 
history of struggling to maintain its own identity and its own lang-
u ge, through centuries of foreign domination.
 
HISTORY OF THE CZECHS IN EUROPE
 
Czechoslovakia is a central european country, composed of two
 
Slavic groups:  the Czechs (85%) populating the western half of the
 
country, and the Slovaks (
15%) populating the eastern half of the
 
country-.  Formed as a republic in 1918, Czechoslovakia has experi-
enced only twenty years of freedom in this century.  After German
 
occupation from 1938 to 1945, it came under the communist shere of
 
influence, and is now considered one of the satelite countries of
 
the Soviet Union.
 
The history of the Czechs started fifteen hundred years ago.
 
In the fifth century, the western part of present day Czechoslovakia
 
was settled by a Slavic tribe led by a man named tech (
Czech).
 
This tribe chose a land that had rich soil, was abundant in wild-
life.
, and had borders that were very hard to defend.
 
The next fifteen centuries brought few periods of freedom.
 
2
 
Its capitol city, Prague; was located in the heart of europe, and
 
was the crossroads of east and west.  The land remained a choice
 
target for invasi:n.  Yet despite strong foreign domination, the
 
Czechs were able :o keep their own national identity and their
 
own language.
 
The period
 greatest emigration to the United States started
 
in the second half of the nineteen t
h century.  Czechs left their
 
homelands seeking economic freedom in the new world.  Some sought
 
political freedo m, others religious freedom, but all knew that this
 
could be achieved through economic freedom.  The Czechs who left
 
europe were litera:e and had occupations.  A high rate of
. literacy
 
existed in their homeland and many were bilingual (
Czech and
. Cerman).
 
Each had a ski l
l,
  trade or occupation, no matter how poor their
 
family had been.  And all came with a strong will to Succeed
.,
 
EARLY HISTORY OF
 E CZECH SCHOOL
 
The first Czech families reached Cedar Rapids in 1852.  This
 
was still a new territory, and these were pioneer families.  All
 
resources were pooled together, and families often shared their
 
homes with newly arrived relatives or another new Czech family.
 
Czech was spoken in the home, and parents taught their children
 
to read and write their mother tongue.  English was learned in
 
the school and in the community.
 
Iowa achieved statehood in 1861.  To promote the settling of
 
its state, it set up the Iowa State Immigration Agency.  This agency
 
actively encouraged its new immigrates to write to their native lands
 
S

S
 
to tell their relatives and neighbors about emigrating to Iowa.
 
The Agency published handbooks in foreign languages on travel,
 
had agents in various european port cities, and had an office in
 
New York so that it c
ould help the new arrivals make direct con-
nections to Iowa.  This network greatly increased the number of
 
Czechs who settled in Iowa.  By the 1870 Census, there were 1
,780
 
Czechs living in LT
hn County who had been born in Europe.
 
As the Czech poru
.lation grew, the ethnic community started to
 
organize itself.  There were several fraternal organizations founded
 
to aid the newcomers and help them cope with loss of life and pro-
perty.  Churches, both Catholic and Protestant, were built.  A
 
Czech language newsDaper was started.  Several cultural organiza-
tions were established, including a reading society with its own
 
Czech library, and a dramatic society.  A savings and loan to aid
 
the Czechs in buying property was also established by the Czech
-
community,
 
Somewhere in the midst of all this community spirit, a formal
 
school for the children was started.  At some point, the effort of
 
teaching the mother tongue shifted from the family to an organized
 
school.  The first mention of this is at an observance of Jan Kus
 
Day, July 6, 1870, when the Reading Society records note that one
 
of the speakers that day was John B. Suster, a teacher at the Czech
 
School.  The actual date of the starting of the school is not known,
 
just that by July, 1870, the school was an established institution.
 
From the Reading Society records and also the Czech newspaper,
 
it is learned that the Czech School is held on Saturday at
hk Sunday
 
during the year, and includes a da i
ly session for fiweweeka d
ing
 
4
 
the summer.  The location of the school varies from sessions held
.
 
in Monroe School and the Reading Society Hall during the years
 
1870 to 1901.
 
By 1890, the enrollment is large enough to consider having its
 
own school building.  A group of mothers join together to start
 
raising funds for a Czech School Building.  The women call them-
selves the D msk  Matice Skoiska (Women's School Board).  Over
 
the next ten years, a building fund is accumulated from proceeds
 
of bazaars and fundraising programs.  Once there is enough for the
 
structure, one of the leading business men in Cedar Rapids, P. W.
 
Severa, donates all of the furniture for the three classrooms and
 
the library
 
.The Czech School Building is formally dedicated on
 
January 1
,1901.
 
CURRICULUM 1870-1930
 
The Czech School is non-sectarian and free.  Children are
 
divided into three grades, based on age and skills.  All learn
 
to read, write and speak the Czech language.  The first grade
 
starts with the gramtar.  The text is published in this country,
 
written specifically for students from Czech families who do speak
 
Czech in the home.  The first grade covers the first section of the
 
book, dealing with the basic alphabet, the three genders, nouns,
 
pronouns, adjectives and verbs.  History is read to the first grade
 
in order to familiarize them with it.  First grade pupils learn to
 
sing Czech songs and to recite poems.
 
Second grade continues with the
y basic gramnar.  Pupils learn

TEACHERS 1870-1930
 
During the course of a year, there were three to six teachers
 
that conducted the classes.  Each grade had a teacher, then there
 
was the music teacher (
usually a viol-inistl, a handwork instructor

for the girls, sometimes a woodworking teacher, and sometimes a
 
dance instructor,

Over the course of

The teachers were not only leading
 
list of teachers is the very
 
chosen to teach the children,
 
citizens of the Czech community,
 
but were native born Czechs who were well educated in the mother
 
country.  Among the teachers were five editors of Czech language
 
newpapers and magazines, a poet, at least two executives, two college
 
professors, and a Dhysician.  As part of the Cedar Rapids Czech com-
munity, these same individuals were very active in the cultural
 
organizations, in the drama groups, in the fraternal organizations
 
and in the different religious organizations.  The children had strong
 
role models to look up to, as well as, just good teachers.
 
It should be noted that the teachers were always appointed to
 
the positions.
 From 1890 to 1905, it was the Women's School Board
 
that did the selection and provided the salaries.
 In 1905, the
 
Czech School Board was formed, the Ustredni Matice.  Teachers were
 
then appointed by that body, as they still are today.

of the Czech School Board.
 
There are many former students now living in Cedar Rapids that
 
attended the Czech School in the Twenties and Thirties.  Many are
 
now retired and have become very active in the Czech community.
 
In fact, these are the very people that are keeping up the tradi-
tions today; they are the leaders of- various fraternal organizations,
 
the athletic groups (the Sokols), social, religious and cultural
 
groups.  Czech businessmen who have renovated their businesses in
 
the old neighborhood and created the successful Czech Village area
 
are former Czech School students.  The Czech Heritage Foundation,
 
with over 800 members, has a board with a high percentage of former
 
Czech School students.  It is very evident that the school has played
 
a major role in keeping the language and the culture of the Czechs
 
still alive for over a hundred years, especially since the last ma o.
 
influx of immigrants was in the 1920's.
 
Students enrolled in the Czech School in the Twenties started
 
to differ from the earlier students because they were growing up
 
more in the American community while still being a part of the
 
Czech community.  The daughter of Martha Kralik, Martha McGrew,
 
who attended the Czech School, still remembers that outside of
 
the Czech community, the students did not discuss the fact that
 
they attended an ethnic school.  As members of an ethnic group,
 
even though they had been born here, and that some families were
 
here for several generations, the members were looked down upon
 
and were considered second class citizens.  Mrs. McGrew is proud
 
of her heritage, and has retained her Czech language ability over
 
the years, even though she married a non-Czech and lived on the
 
10
 
West Coast for most of her married life.
 
Another student from the Twenties was Mildred Libal Drahovzal.
 
As a student, she remembers that Czech School students were teased
 
by American students and called various names.  She disticntly re-
members that she resented going to Czech School the last couple of
 
years.  This attitude did not seem to affect her learning, however,
 
for she is bilingual in Czech and English and speaks both without
 
any trace of accent.  She is also proficient in the written language.
 
Over the years, she has been active in the Czech community, and made
 
a major contribution to many of its organizations.  In addition,
 
she has served the Czech School in three different capacities.
 
First, she has served for many years on the Damska Matice board,
 
including as its president.
 It was the Women's School Board that
 
took care of the physical school building over the years that the
 
structure was used as a school.  She has also been the secretary
 
I
 _ 
of the Ustredni. Matice, the Czech School Board, for several years
 
and has kept the meeting notes, which were always written in Czechs
 
And lastly, Mrs. Drahovzal has served as a teacher in the Czech
 
School for seventeen years.
 
John Vosatka was also a student in the Twenties, but his wife
 
Ruth, was not.  Both were from Czech families, and Czech was their
 
first language.  What is interesting, is the fact that John was
 
sent to Czech School by his parents, but Ruth was taught Czech at
 
home by her mother.  Today, both do speak Czech very well and both
 
read Czech, but where John can write Czech, Ruth cannot.  Mrs. Vosatka
 
attributes this difference to the fact that John attended a
. forn
1
 
school,
, where she was taught by her mother from a reader and

not get much practice writing the language.  Her parents attended
 
a Czech church were the sermons and hymns were all Czech and so
 
were the prayer books, so they assumed that this would be enough
 
to learn the language.  But formal schooling does make a difference,
 
andit was evident in this case.  With their own children, the Vosatkas
 
chose to send them to Czech School.  Today, one of their grandchildren
 
is also enrolled in the school.
 
ClASS STRUCTURE
 
In the 1870's, when the formal Czech School was first organ-
ized in the United States, the school system in the mother country
 
consisted of a basic elementary school of four grades.  All children
 
started this schooling and many finished all four years;
 those
 
who could, attended at least three years if they could not finish.
 
This schooling was available even in the small villages.  Children
 
who stopped after three years were from families where the economy
 
was such that the children had to start earning money at age nine.
 
This basic elementary school system accounted for the high literacy
 
rate of the Czech immigrates.  The next level of education was the
 
Gymnasium.  Children had to go to towns for this level of education
 
and families had to have the money to send them, thuá, the advanced
 
schooling was for more gifted or wealthier children.  The university
 
was the final level of higher education,  Charles University had
 
been founded in Prague in 1348 and provided graduate training for
 
qualified students who passed entrance tests and who wished to go
 
on to study science, mathematics, medicine, law or literature, etc.
 
12
 
The immigrants who settled here decided to provide a curricuim
 
of at least the three basic grades, plus music and
. dance.  It was
 
understood that the pupils attending the Czech School would also be
 
attending the American public school, so the three year program
 
in their native language need concentrate only on language and
 
culture, instead of all subjects of elementary education.  The
 
three year system was also flexible, in that a child need attend
 
the school only for three years and be free to help the family
 
after age nine.
 
Starting at about the turn of the century, children continued
 
to at-
tend the Czech School for more than three years.  Even though
 
the students came from homes where Czech was spoken, the school
 
classes were held on Saturdays and Sundays throughout the year,
 
with a special concentrated summer session of five weeks, and
. this
 
proved not to be enough to meet the proficiency expected of each
 
grade level.  There appeared to be no stigma attached to any pupil
 
who needed to attend the school classes for more than three years.
 
With each succeeding generation, it became more common to have a
 
child attend classes for more than three years, even up to age
 
thirteen or fourteen, when they would be graduating from the Ameri-
can public school.  Graduation from the Czech School was encouraged,
 
no matter how long it took to achieve the desired language proficiency.
 
The Czech School was free.  A token tuition for the summer
 
session was 500 per child, if the family could afford it, but
 
a child could attend even if the tuition was not paid.  Later,
 
after World War II,
. the tuition was raised to $1.00.  In the 1970's
 
this tuition
, was raised to $2.00.

SCHOOL BOARD
 
The Czech School Board (st ednC Matice) was formed in 1905.
 
Once the school building had been built, ongoing support was need-
ed to maintain the program and the physical building.  The School
 
Board was established giving each Czech group that was contributing to
 
the support of the school a vote in the administration of it.
 
here are currently sixteen members on the School Board, each
 
with one vote, who represent various fraternal, athletic and
 
cultural organizations in
 
from non-tuition sources,
 
from these organizations.
 
is the selling of tickets
 
annual Student Program and
 
Cedar Rapids.  Since most financing comes
 
the bulk of the necesary funding comes
 
The only fundraising done during the year
 
to the Ice Cream Social which preceeds the
 
Graduation Ceremony;
 this is held the
 
last Friday evening of the Summer Session.
 
The school budget in the last few years has required approx-
imately one thousand dollars
 
this, the largest percentage
 
1982 session, there were two
 
to support the Summer Session.  Of
 
went for teacher salaries.  In the
 
teachers, each receiving a salary of
 
three hundred dollars, plus twenty cents a mile for mileage to
 
cover their commuting to and from school.  In addition to salaries,
 
all paper, pencils and textbooks are provided for each student.
 
Some new copies of the textbook, a basic gratnmer, were purchased
 
this year to replenish the supply of worn out texts.  The next
 
largest amount is the money spent for bus rentals for the one
 
field trip that the classes take each year.  This year, the cost
 
were minimal because the children were taken on a picnic at a
 
14
 
nearby park.  Other years, the field trip was a more extensive
 
venture.  Two  years ago, the children were taken to visit Spill-
yu le, Iowa, the town where the famous Czech composer, Anton n
 
Dvo ak, spent his time in the United States on a visit here.
 
There are no longer any costs for the maintenance of a
 
school building.
 In the 1950's, the School building was sold.
 
Since then, classes for the Summer Session are held in one of
 
the public schools in the neighborhood of the sou t
hwest side of
 
Ced r Rapids.  The 1982 location was Grant School.  The Cedar
 
Rapids Community School Board is very helpful and each year provides
 
space in one of its school buildings for three classes to be held
 
each morning for the course of the summer term.  The cooperation
 
with the school district is greatly appreciated.  The location
 
is provided, free of charge.
 
In addition to financing, the School Board of the Czech
 
School has full authority over the entire program.  The Board
 
selects the teachers, chooses the curriculum materials, provides
 
any supplemental materials such as dictionaries, maps, paper and
 
pencils, decides on the dates of the Summer Session, the location
 
where it will be held, and decides on what type of field trip to
 
take the children upon.
 
The major changes in the curriculum materials have occurred
 
only twice in the last forty years.  Once the students started to
 
to be from homes where both
 glish and Czech were spoken, the
 
basic grammar was changed to a more simplified edition with a
 
smaller vocabulary.  The Reader was discontinued
 In the 1960's,
 
the grammar text was changed to a second edition of the same work.
 
S
 
15
 
This second edition is in current use.
 It includes a base vocab-
ulary of about three hundred words;
 there is no attempt to deal
 
with anything beyond basic sentence structure.
 
2he decisions concerning the change of the curriculum materials
 
was done by Board members who were students once themselves, but
 
who became aware of the shifting role of the school.  Once it was
 
no longer possible to expect a certain proficiency on the part of
 
the s dents, especially since fewer and fewer were from Czech
 
speaking homes, the Board shifted the priorities of the school
 
from language maintenance of the mother tongue, to just a basic
 
language familiarity and more of a cultural maintenance.  The
 
present day students are introduced to a second language, the
 
language of their cultural heritage.
 
The Board still does choose teachers carefully, based on their
 
language ability.  Native born teachers are still preferred when
 
available.  American born teachers are chosen on their fluency
 
and correct pronunciation;  both teachers in the last few years
 
in this category came from Czech speaking parents, and both knew
 
Czech before they spoke English.
 
Records from Board meetings since 1970 indicate that the
 
Board now meets four times a year:  March, April, May and July.
 
The first three sessions are to make plans for the coming year '
s
 
session, and the last meeting is held after the session to get
 
a progress report and to pay the teachers.  The meetings have
 
been conducted in Czech, and all the notes prior to June, 1982,
 
have been in Czech.  In the last few years, the meetings are in
 
English, but the Czech minutes are read, as written.  In June of
 
16
 
this year, a new secretary was elected, to take over the position
 
Crom Mrs. Drahovzal who was too ill to continue.  The new secretary

i
as no Czech background, and does not speak Czech, so she is keeping
 
the notes in English.  To keep up past traditions, after the notes
 
were read in English, the President, Ed Kuba, did translate the notes
 
Lnto Czech for the members present.  As the times change, the Board
 
siso changes and adapts.
 
PRESENT CRR
 ICUlUM
 
Classes are usually divided into three grades, with each
 
grade having its own teacher and its own classroom.  The 1982
 
Juuimer Session was an exception, having only two classes and two
 
t
eachers, but it was a last minute arrangement because of the
 
serious illness of one of the teachers who had been teaching for
 
the last seventeen years.
 
Children are divided by age and by ability-.  Usually children
 
start at age seven, after they have learned to read and to write.
 
The first grade usually has the seven and eight year olds who are
 
just begining and who have had no previous experience with the
 
Czech language.
 
The second grade has the nine and ten year olds.  Since
 
t
nany of the children come from families where all the children
 
attend as they are old enough, thia middle level covers the
 
children who have been, introduced to t
ime language the year before,.
 
17
 
but who are still very elementary in their skills, and have almost
 
no recall of the prior years vocabulary.  Sometimes, a bright nine
 
or ten year old
., who has not attended before, is put into the
 
second grade when it appears that he or she can catch up to the
 
second level in the first week when the last years lessons are
 
reviewed.
 
The third grade is composed of the most advanced students.
 
They are us
lly eleven through thirteen year olds.  If a stut
h
 
started at age seven and attends the school each year, it is t
'
r
 
third grade that they will stay in for three or four years.  This
 
is where the major amount of language skills and vocabulary can
 
be learned,  The text used for all three classes is the same
 
grammar.  Thus, through repetition year after year, vocabulary
 
is retained.  In the third grade, students cover some basic
 
geography of the homeland, and history of the motherland is
 
learned.
 
Students from all three classes learn Czech songs.  Each
 
day all the students gather together for a half hour to sing
 
together.  In
. the last two weeks, the students practice togëther:
 
for the program that will be presented on the last night of the
 
session.
 
The text, Prvnl Ctanka, (First Reader) is a very basic
 
grammar with a vocabulary.  This is the only text provided for
 
the students and teachers by the School Board.  It is used
, all
 
the way through by all three grades.  There is no workbook or
 
supplemental material.  It is up to each individual teacher to
 
cover what is in the text that is appropriate for each level,
 
18
 
and it is up to the teacher to decide how to present it to their
 
students.  The 3oard does not give any guidelines to them, nor
 
does it set any standards for proficiency for today's students,
 
It is solely up to the teachers if they give any tests or require
 
any levels of accomplishment.
 
The only other items that are used and provided for the
 
teachers are
 song sheets (without the musical scores).  ----
.
ere
 
is one additional item that has been handed down from tea:her to
 
teacher, and that is a poster with the translation of the
 
merican
 
Pledge of Allegiange to the Flag (
Slib Vlajce);  Every mcrning,
 
each class is started with the Pledge of Allegiance in Czech.
 
This is an exact, word by word, translation.  Some of the words
 
are long and very difficult to pronounce in Czech, but all of the
 
children do memorize it.  This custom has been a part of Czech
 
School as long as anyone can remember.  The Pledge was written
 
and introduced to the U. S. in 1893 in the Youths Companion, It
 
was probably adopted for use in the Czech School soon after that
 
and has been used ever since
 The use of this is very interesting,
 
for it indicates the strong feeling that has existed for the Czech
 
immigrants for their adopted homeland.
 
Since the teachers are basically on their own to teach their
 
classes, it might be pertinent to cite what the daily schedule is
 
in each class.  The teacher for the first and second grades for
 
the 1982 session was Leona Kaplan.  After the Pledge was recited,
 
the children were greeted in Czech.  Then together they recited
 
some sayings (later used in the program), the colors, the days
 
of the week, the months,
, and the numbers one through ten.  Next,
 
20
 
f
.
 
of the day before, trying to remember all of the words and their
 
meanings without looking them up.
 It should be noted that Mrs.
 
Kaplan did a good j
ob working with two grades at once,  She has
 
a background of teaching in the public school system for over
 
twenty-five years.  She started her teaching career in a one
 
room country school, and became familiar with teaching children
 
of all ages together in one room and keeping them all working at
 
their individual levels,  The Czech School was lucky to have her
 
as one of the teachers the year that they needed to combine two
 
grades into one classroom.
 
The teacher for the third grade during the 1982 session was
 
Rose Drymi.  This year, the third grade also included some younger
 
students who would
, ordinarily be in second grade;  these were
 
•
 students that had been in second grade last year, and were more
 
advanced and older.  There were also two twelve year olds who had
 
never gone to Czech School before, but who were too old to be put
 
into the class with young children.  Mrs. Drymi is an experienced
 
teacher in the Czech School, this was her twenty-fifth year teach-
ing, so she was very capable handling such a diversified group.
 
The third grade starts its day with the Pledge of Allegiance.
 
After greeting the students in Czech, the students return the greet-
ing.  All students work together.  First the lesson from the day
 
before is covered and reviewed, then the days lesson is read.
 
Students are expected to write the translations into their note-
books
 Pronunciation is also streesed.  Each days lesson covers at
 
least two pages in the grammar.  Students are then asked to go to
 
the board and write sentences, all in Czech,. uain  all their To-
19
 
the -
.wo grades were separated.  While Mrs. Kaplan worked with the
 
first grade, the :econd grade copied the vocabulary
 
from the board, lcoked up the meanings of the words
 
ary, and reviewed the lesson of the day before.
 If
 
all this early, :hey were allowed to get some paper
 
draw whatever the-: wished.  Meantime, the first
 
vocabulary for  hat day.  A list of perhaps six
 
pronouziced correo u
ly, translated and discussed.
 
for the day
 
in the diction-
they finished
 
and colc
•r and
 
grade learned its
 
words was read,
 
Mrs. Kaplan would
 
try to associa-e each word with something that the children would
 
remember.  After this session, while she worked with the second
 
grade, the first z'aders would copy out the new vocabulary wcr
 
in their notebcc s, along with the translation.  Later they were
 
given a list of The Czech words, after the board had been erased,
 
and were expecTed to match up the Czech word with the English
 
word.  Another time, they would be given the Czech word, and
 
uon hearing it ;ronounced, they had to write it out correctly.
 
These tests were Then graded by Mrs. Kaplan.  She would take a
 
momment to discuss each test paper with each student;  mistakes
 
were corrected and discussed.  Basically, the same was done with
 
the second grade, however, they would work with eight or nine
 
words at one time.  Being more advanced, they were also asked
 
to write sentences;  however, they would use the Czech word in
 
an English sentence s About halfway through the morning, the
 
first and second grades would join the third graders in their
 
classroom to s
iiig together.  After they came back, the younger
 
children were given a short break to walk around or play a game
 
in their classroom. Then both grades would go over the lesson
 
S

S
 
cabulary to date and incorporating the new words of the day's
 
lesson.  Each student is asked to read their own sentences.
 
The teacher helps to correct the sentence so that the endings
 
of the the words agree as to gender and number.  The students
 
are ecoected to write the corrected sentences in their notebooks.
 
At the end of the summer session, third grade students recite
 
some of their best sentences as part of the program, and this
 
work is pre araticn for this.  Mrs. Dryml helps to make the
 
classes interesting by having the students participate in various
 
ways:  one day she will have the class use their vocabulary to
 
converse with each other in an impromptu senerio; another day
 
she will have the class work on geography and she will recall 
some of her exDeriences growing up in Czechoslovakia, or discuss
 
history with them.  It becomes a real challange to keep her
 
students learning.
 
The text used in the classes is a basic vocabulary, has
 
only simple sentences, and its content is devoid of any political
 
or religious conctation.  Thus, today the curriculum is really
 
just an introduction to a second language, and the classes just
 
provide some insight into the cultural heritage of the students.
 
TEA kuktS
 
In the one-hundred twelve year history of the Czech School in
 
Cedar Rapids, there have been
, a total of less than seventy teachers.
 
Of these, twenty five have tau
t in the last fifty years •
 The trend
 
22
 
in this second half of its history has been to find qualified
 
teachers and keep them teaching as long as they are able.  This
 
does provide continuity for the curriculum.  The teachers have been
 
able to change and adapt over the years, as their students changed,
 
so there were few problems.
 
The Board, over the years, has maintained a high standard
, of
 
quality when aPPointing its teachers.  Currently, only three teaching
 
positions exist.  The Board still tries to find teachers who are
 
native speakers and who have a certain level of education.  The
 
teachers still are also community leaders, active in ethnic organ-
izations.  When a native born teacher is not available, the Ecard
 
chooses individuals with a fluency in the mother tongue, as well as,
 
excellent pronunciation and a certain level of writing skills.  To
 
date, all U. S. born teachers have been from families where Czech
 
was their first language.
 There is no training program for these
 
teachers.  They either learn from other teachers from past years,
 
or are individuals that do have an English teaching background.
 
Long term teachers have noted the changes in both the cu
rriculum
 
and the students.  Both Mrs. Drymi and Mrs. Drahovzal, teaching twenty-
five years and seventeen years, respectfully, have seen the students
 
change in the level of knowledge of Czech at the start of their en-
rollments.  In the Fifties, there were still some students who came
 
from homes where Czech was spoken, either by the parents together,
 
or by a parent and the grandparents.  In the Sixties, the trend was
 
more that a parent understood Czech, but no longer spoke it;  only
 
the grandparents spoke the mother tongue.  In
. the Seventies, the
 
parents no
. longer even understood the mother tongue;  the grandparents
 
23
 
were the ones who either still spoke Czech, or at least unders cod
 
it.  By the Sixties, it was common for parents to intermarry in c
 
the American community.  They were products of the Forties and
 
Fifties, and it was not popular to identify with an ethnic grouD.
 
Their children usually attended only because of pressure from the
 
grandparents who wanted the future generations to keep up the
 
heritage of their ancestors.
 
The lowest ebb o: enrollment in the Czech School was reached
 
in the late Sixties and early Seventies.  Part of this may have been
 
due to the fact that the post-war baby boom was putting off having
 
children.  A large part was of this was the lack of interest in
 
anything ethnic, and a
pathy in general, by the young adult genera-
tion.
 
•
The revival of interest, of course, came with the focus on
 
history that the preparations for the Bi-centenial started in the
 
U. S. .
 History, especially ones own geneology, became very popular.
 
This escalated even more after the country was introduced to Roots.
 
Today, the teachers note that the students might mention that
 
their family name is Czech, or that their grandparents are Czech,
 
and that they come to Czech School to learn a second language and
 
to learn about their heritage.  The interest is definitely there on
 
the part of the Dupils.  The approach of the students, though, is
 
quite different.  Most now come from schools where the open class
 
concept has been used, or tried
., and the children lack discipline.
 
They must be challenged, their interests must be captured, before
 
they listen and work.  They are much more
. independent than past
 
generations of students, and there is no automatic respect for
 
24
 
the teacher.  Today the teacher must earn it.
 
All three teachers have noticed the change in the independence
 
of the student.  The children come back year after year, only if
 
they want to;  parents nor grandparents can "force" them to attend
..
 
Often during the course of the session, the teachers watch for
 
progress, see what appears to be little improvement (and sometimes
 
little interest), and wonder how it will come out "this year".
 
What will the program I
cok like at the end of the session?  Will
 
any of the children come back next year?  Then the last day comes
 
and so do the surprises.
 
This year, the orcgram went off very well.  All the parents
 
were very pleased, and the community members who attended the program
 
were also pleased.  The children did a fine job.  The Czech School
 
still thrives.  There is again hope for next year.  The teachers
 
breathe a sigh of relief.
 
But this year, the teachers learned some additional things
 
from their students.  First, the third teacher that was very ill
 
and was not able to teach, was missed by the students.  Those who
 
knew her even tape-recorded a message to her.  They wished her
 
a speedy recovery and told her about what was going on this year
 
that she was missing. In the course of the conversation it came
 
out that the third grade students had applied peer pressure to
 
one of their members who was especially disruptive in the third
 
grade, and warned him to either stop it or be "beat up'.  It seems
 
that there is some standard of behavior that even the students them-
selves- desire,
 
The third grade teacher, Mrs. Drymi,
, also learned something from
 
2
5
 
her students.
 This was her twenty-fifth year teaching in Czech
 
School.  On the morning of the last day, her students made arrange-
ment to come to the school at seven thirty to decorate her room for
 
a special suprise party.

It was kept a secret from her.  The other
 
asked to help them keep it secret, but
 
to attend.  one of the students, the
 
oldest boy, baked three cakes for the party.  The oldest girl took
 
care of most of the other details and bought a gift.  The students
 
were all in on it and each helped in some way.
 It was a complete
 
surprise, and a very happy one.  The idea came from the students,
 
and they carried it out.  It shows a lot about how the School an

CH111REN (
CURRENT  TLTa TS)
 
During the course of the session, the children were asked,
 
in the third grade, why do they attend s Most agreed that they
 
wish to learn about their Czech heritage.  Several indicated that
 
they wished to learn a second language, the language of their
 
grandparents.  As had been stated earlier, the children are there
 
because they want to be there.
 
One of the boys in the second grade, Chris Ransom, the grand-
son of the Vosatkas, is attending for the first time.  Last year,
 
his grandparents took him to the Ice Cream Social and the Program.
 
He decided that he would like to go to Czech School to learn the
 
language of his grandparents after he saw the students sing and
 
recite.  His parents
, were surprised.  His mother attended when she
 
was his age, in the Fifties, but had
, mairried a non-Czech.  She
 
26
 
is aware of her heritage, and even understands Czech, but she was
 
not going to automatically send her sons to Czech School,  After
 
Chris indicated on his own that he wished to attend, the older boy
 
was asked if he would like to go also;  he chose not to.  Chris
 
is a good student and learned his vocabulary quickly.  He comes
 
home and practices some of his new words on his older brother and
 
his father, both of whom have no knowledge of the Czech language.
 
Chris is nine years old and will continue attending Czech School.
 
He is proud of his second language ability.  It should be added that
 
Chris had to make a special effort to attend because there was a
 
conflict in time schedules with his regular swimming lessons.  There
 
were several early morning swimming lessons that he chose to miss
 
because he wanted the extra time to spend in Czech School.
 
The students who attend today live in all areas of Cedar Rapids,
 
not just in the southwest neighborhood that has been traditionally
 
the Czech area,  Most of the year, there is no contact with anything
 
Czech,  Their best friends are from the American community.  The
 
Czech influence is part of their lives only to the extent that they
 
wish to include it.
 
David and James Hruska are brothers, currently attending the
 
third grade.  They have a Czech last name, one that is especially
 
hard to pronounce.  It was their parents, that decided to send
 
them to Czech School, at least to start them, so that they would be
 
aware of their heritage.  David is the older
 
.This year, he was
 
old enough to graduate, if he chose to, or he could continue for
 
one more year s He finally chose to continue next year.  He is
 
very interested in
. learning the language, even
. tG the extent that

he has made plans to attend a university where Czech is offered
 
as a foreign language.  In addition to an interest in language,
 
David loves music and plays several instruments.  He has become
 
familiar with all ty-pes of Czech music, including popular and
 
classical.  As part of a fi eld trip
 from the Czech School in
 
1980, David was given a unique opportunity.  The classes took
 
a field trip to Spillvj f
le, Iowa, the town where the famous Czech
 
composer, Anton n  r
o aL
-z, lived and wrote his music while he visitei
 
the U.S.,  On the visit, David was allowed to play the organ that
 
Antonin Dvorak played on.  This was quite an occasion for him,
 
and it has influenced his music since then.  It certainly is an
 
experience which he will never
 
and has different interests.
 
for three more years, and it
 
forget.  James is two years younger
 
He plans on attending Czech School
 
is by his own decision.  Both boys
 
are quite different, but they do share one thing in common, they
 
are the fourth generation to attend Czech School in their family:
 
they are the great-grandsons of Martha Kralik, thecoldest student
 
interviewed for this study.
 
PARENTS
 
The parents have played the greatest role over the years in
 
the whole history of the Czech School.  The school was first or-
ganized after the parents chose to take the teaching out of the
 
home and into a more formal and structured setting.  It was the
 
mothers who banded together and raised funds for the School Building.
 
I- 
'
 1
 
It was the mothers that formed the Dameka Matice Skoiska, sort of
 
28
 
a "
PTA" that also did early fundraising.  Later after a formal
 
Czech School Board was formed, it was the Women's School Board
 
that took care of the physical building.  Mothers took turns
 
coming to school with a bucket and scrub brush to washthe floors.
 
After the School Building was sold, the proceeds from it were put
 
into a trust, and scholarshi ps are still awarded from this money
 
even today.
 Fathers were the ones who did the repairs and the
 
maintenance of the old building, when they had time.  The early
 
years of the Czech School were hard times.  Fathers worked from
 
12 to 18 hours a day, six days a week to earn enough for the families
 
to live on.  They also were drafted and went to war during some of
 
these years.  Their role was just as important as that of the mother,
 
in the life of each child, it was just not so visible.
 
Parents today still clay very important roles in the continu-
ation of the Czech School.  Thday, parents must make time commit-
ments to provide chauffer service to and from school.  Since the
 
families live all over the city, this means a half hour trip to
 
school in the morning, a half hour back home, then two hours later
 
a half hour trip back to school to pick up the student and another
 
half hour back home:  a total of two hours of driving each day
 
for four weeks!
 For those rarents that do not, or cannot drive,
 
it means the added expense for providing another parent or friend
 
to do this driving for them.
 
One of the parents interviewed was Sharon Hr-tska, the mother
 
of David and James,
, and also the secretary of the 1982 Czech School
 
Board.  She indicated that the first two years that her oldest
 
son, David, at-tended the summer session,
, she. did not know how to
 
- 9
 
S
 
S
 
drive, and had to provide a driver for David and pay the expenses.
 
This experience was one of the factors that influenced her decision
 
to learn how to drive.  She has now been driving her sons to Czech
 
School for five years.  She admits that it has been a real com-
mitment on her part.  Both Mr. and Mrs. Hruska made the decision
 
to start their son in Czech School the first year, to let him learn
 
about his heritage.  It should be noted that while Mr. Hruska does
 
come from a Czech family, his wife does not.  But she has taken a
 
real interest in her sons' activities, their heritage, and their
 
personal family history,  3-
he has joined some Czech organizations,
 
and is a representative to the School Board for one of the Czech
 
fraternal lodges.  This year, she has taken the added responsibi-
lity of acting as secretary for the group.  As a concerned parent,
 
she is happy to serve on the School Board because she is concerned
 
about the continuation of the school, as well as, the quality of
 
the education that her sons receive.  She and her husband both
 
monitorthe homework each day, and discuss the school day over
 
supper with the boys.  They involve the boys in a variety of
 
activities, in both the ethnic community and the mainstream of
 
society.  They hope that as the boys grow older, they will re-
member their heritage, but involve themselves in both worlds.
 
There can not be said that there is a'typical' parent of the
 
student today, but there are many shared concerns,  The statements
 
that Mrs. Hruska made concerning the daily monitor of progress
 
during the session, the driving arrangement problems, and the
 
aspirations for her sons' futures, arai, statements that are echoed
 
by other parents today.  It is true that the students themselves
 
are the ones who ultimately decide whether or not they will
 
continue to attend the Czech School, but it is the parents who
 
provide the support services to enable them to do so.
 
SUMMARY
 
The Czech School in Cedar ?
Lapids, Iowa, can be described as
 
a very interesting phenomena,  For over one hundred twelve years,
 
classes have been held for students in a non-sectarian, apolitical,
 
ethnic school to provide for each successive new generation the
 
language and cultural heritage of the mother tongue of their ances -
tors.  The school is conducted by the best teachers that the Czech
 
society can find.  The school is supported by the local community
 
and is totally independent of any other Czech school in the United
 
States:  it just serves its own community,  Over the years, the
 
curriculum reflects the changing values of the Czech community
 
that supports it.  Under the leadership of its School Board, the
 
school survives as a separate, dynamic entity, despite the changes
 
of the community and the students.  Its long history covers times
 
of new immigrants struggling to adapt to a new homeland to times
 
five generations later, after there has been total integration into
 
the melting pot of America.  Yet the unique ethnic identy still
 
survives.  It is the Czech School that has played one of the major
 
roles in maintaining the cultural identity of each succeeding gene-
ration of students.  The Czech School itself was never large.  At
 
the height of the immigrations, it had just over 200 students in
 
the three grades;  at the points of its lowest ebb, it was down to
 
30
 
0
 
3
1
 
just a total of 15 students.  But it was able to change its curricu-
lum, change with the times, and it continues to exist.  By helping
 
to define the cultural identity, the community was able to maintain
 
its identity, thereby, insuring that future generations will con-
tinue to have a unique identity.
 
Czechoslovakia is a Central European country,  composed of two Slavic
 
groups:  the Czechs, who represent eighty-five percent of the population,
 
residing mostly in the western half of the country,  and the Slovaks, who number
 
fifteen percent,  living in the eastern half of the country.  Formed as a
 
republic in 1918, Czechoslovakia has experienced only twenty years of freedom
 
in this century.  After German occupation from 1938 to  1945  it came under the
 
Communist sphere of influence and is now considered one of  the satellite
 
countries of the Soviet Union.
 
The h
istory of the Czechs began f
ifteen hundred years ago. In the 5th
 
The next f
ifteen centuries brought f
ew periods of freedom. I
ts capitol
 
city, Prague, was located in the heart of Europe and was the crossroads between
 
the East and West. The land remained a choice t
arget for invasion. Yet despite
 
many periods of foreign domination, the Czechs were able t
o keep their own
 
national i
dentity and t
heir own language.
 
The period of greatest Czech emigration t
o the United States started in
 
the second half of the 1
9th century. Czechs left their homelands s
eeking
 
economic freedom in the New World. Some ultimately sought political freedom,
 
others r
eligious freedom, but all knew that these c
ould be achieved through
 
2
 
economic freedom. The Czechs who left Europe were literate, had a skill, trade,
 
or occupation, and many were bilingual in Czech and German. All of them arrived
 
with a s
trong will to succeed.
 
The f
irst Czech families reached Cedar Rapids in 1852.  Iowa was still a
 
new territory, and these were pioneer families. All resources were pooled.
 
Families often shared their homes with newly arrived relatives or with other
 
Czech families.  Czech was spoken in the home and parents taught their children
 
to read and write their mother tongue. English was learned in the school and in
 
the community.
 
Iowa achieved s
tatehood in 1
861. To promote the settling of the state,
 
residents set up the Iowa State Immigration Agency. This agency actively
 
encouraged new immigrants to write to their native lands and  suggest to their
 
relatives and neighbors that they emigrate to Iowa. The agency published travel
 
handbooks in foreign languages, had agents in various European port cities, and
 
had an office in New York to help the new arrivals make direct connections to
 
Iowa. This network greatly increased the number of Czechs who settled in the
 
state.  According to the 1870 census, there were 1
,780 Czechs who had been born
 
in Europe living in Linn County.
 
As the Czech population grew the ethnic community started t
o organize
 
itself. There were several fraternal organizations founded to aid the newcomers
 
and help them cope with loss of life and property. Churches, both Catholic and
 
Protestant, were built. A Czech-language newspaper were started. Several
 
3
 
Cultural organizations were established, including a reading society with i
ts
 
own Czech library and a dramatic society. A savings and loan was also
 
established by the Czech community to aid the Czechs in buying property.
 
History of the Czech School
 
At s
ome point during the 1
9th century the effort of teaching the mother
 
tongue shifted from the family to the community and a school was organized.
 
The first mention of the school i
s at an observance of Jan Hus day--July 6
,
 
1870 —when the Reading Society records note that one of the speakers that day
 
was Jot-i
n B
.  Suster, a teacher at the Czech school. The actual date on which the
 
school started is not known, but by July 1870 the school was an established
 
institution.
 
From the Reading Society records and the Czech newspaper one learns that
 
the Czech school was held on Saturday and Sunday during the year and included a
 
daily session for five weeks during the summer. The location of t
he school
 
varied between the Monroe School and the Reading Society Hall during the years
 
1
870 to 1
901.
 
By 1890 the enrollment was large enough to consider establishing a
 
separate school building. A group of mothers calling themselves the Damska
 
Matice Skoiska (Women's School Board) joined together to start raising funds.
 
Over the next ten years the  building fund was augmented by proceeds of
 
bazaars and fund—raising programs. Once there were enough for the structure one
 
4
 
of the leading businessmen in Cedar Rapids, F
.W.  S
evera, donated all of the
 
furniture for the three classrooms and the library. The Czech school building
 
was formally dedicated on January 1
, 1
901.
 
Classes and Curriculum
 
The Czech school was non—sectarian and free. Children were divided into
 
three grades, based on age and skills. All grades learned to read, write, and
 
speak the Czech language. The first grade started with the grammar, using a
 
text published in this country and written specifically for students from Czech
 
families who did speak Czech in the home. They covered the first section of the
 
book, learning the basic alphabet, the three genders, nouns, pronouns,
 
adjectives, and verbs. History was read to them and they also learned to sing
 
Czech songs and recite poems.
 
Second graders continued with the basic grammar. They learned sentence
 
structure, how to make the gender, number, and case of words agree, and how to
 
write compositions. They read for themselves the history that had been read t
o
 
them as first graders and continued singing Czech songs. Their reader included
 
poetry, which they memorized. They studied the geography of their native land
 
and its native dances, which they performed in various programs. Second
 
graders also took part in plays.
 
Third grade students were expected to reach a certain level of proficiency
 
in reading and grammar, as well as history and geography. No student was
 
allowed to receive a diploma and graduate without having satisfactorily proven
 
a proficiency in all the required skills.
 
In addition to the set curriculum of the three grades, children were
 
divided into groups by age and sex and taught etiquette and comportment. Boys
 
learned woodworking and woodcarving. Girls learned knitting, lacemaking, and
 
embroidery. Violin lessons were also available to promising young s
tudents.
 
In the 1870s, when the formal Czech school was first organized in the
 
United States, the school system in the mother country consisted of a basic
 
elementary school of four grades. All children started this schooling and many
 
finished all four years. Those who could, attended at least three years. Such
 
schooling was available even in the small villages. Children who stopped after
 
three years were from families in which the children had to s
tart earning money
 
at age nine. This basic elementary school system accounted for the high
 
literacy rate of the Czech immigrates.
 
The next level of education was the gymnasium. Children had to go to towns
 
t
o acquire that level of education, and families had to have the money to send
 
them; therefore, the advanced schooling was for more gifted or wealthy
 
children.
 
veL
L y  was c
r
ie ti nal  level of higher education. Charles University
 
was founded in Prague in 1
348. It provided graduate training for qualified
 
students who passed entrance tests and who wished to go on to s
tudy science,
 
mathematics, medicine, law, literature, etc.
 
6
 
The immigrants who settled here decided t
o provide a curriculum of at
 
least the three basic grades, plus music and dance. It was understood that the
 
pupils attending the Czech school would also be attending the American public
 
school, so the three-year program in their native language needed to
 
concentrate only on language and culture. The three-year system also provided
 
the option for the child t
o help the family after age nine.
 
At about tne turn of the century children began t
o attend the Czech school
 
for more than three years. The school classes were held on Saturdays and
 
Sundays throughout the year, with a special concentrated summer session of f
ive
 
weeks, but the schedule proved not to be enough to meet the proficiency
 
expected of each grade level. There appears to have been no s
tigma attached t
o
 
any pupil's needing to attend the school classes for more than three years.
 
With each succeeding generation it became more common to have a child attend
 
classes for more than three years, even up to age thirteen or fourteen, when
 
they would be graduating from the American public school. Graduation from the
 
Czech school was encouraged, no matter how long i
t took to achieve the desired
 
language proficiency.
 
The Czech school was free. A token tuition for the summer session was
 
charged---50 cents per child, if the family could afford if —but a child could
 
attend even if the tuition was not paid. After World War II the tuition
 
was raised to $1.00 and in the 1970s to $2.00.
 
Major changes in the curriculum materials have occurred only twice in the
 
last forty years. Once the students started to come from homes where both
 
English and Czech were spoken, the basic grammar was changed t
o a more
 
7
 
Simplified edition with a smaller vocabulary and the reader was discontinued.
 
In the 1960s the grammar text was changed to a second edition of the same work,
 
which is in current use. It includes a basic vocabulary of about three hundred
 
words and there is no attempt to deal with anything beyond basic sentence
 
structure.
 
The decisions concerning the change of the curriculum materials were made
 
by board members,  students once themselves, who became aware of the shifting
 
role of t
he school. Once i
t was no longer possible to expect a certain
 
proficiency on the part of the students, especially since fewer and fewer were
 
from Czech -speaking homes, the board shifted the priorities of the school from
 
language maintenance t
o basic language familiarity and cultural maintenance.
 
Present-day students are introduced to a second language —the language of their
 
cultural heritage.
 
The board still chooses teachers carefully, based on their language
 
ability. Native-born teachers are still preferred, when available. The
 
selection of American-born teachers is based on their fluency and correct
 
pronunciation.  In the last few years two American-born teachers at the school
 
came from Czech- speaking parents, and both knew Czech before they spoke
 
English.
 
Minutes kept since 1
970 indicate that the board now schedules four
 
meetings a year: March, April, May and July. During the first three sessions
 
the board makes plans for the coming year's Summer Session. Their last meeting
 
is held after the school session to get a progress report and to pay the
 
teachers. In the past the meetings have been conducted in Czech and all the
 
8
 
notes made prior to June 1
982 have also been in Czech. In the last few years
 
the meetings have been conducted in English, but the Czech minutes were read as
 
written. A new secretary was elected in June 1
982 to take over the position
 
from Mrs. Drahovzal, who was too ill to continue. The new secretary, Sharon
 
Hruska, is a new board member and the parent of two the students. She has no
 
Czech background and does not speak Czech, so she i
s keeping the notes in
 
English. To keep up past traditions, however, after the notes are read in
 
English, Board President Ed Kuba translates the notes into Czech for the
 
members present. As the t
imes change, the board also changes and adapts.
 
Today classes are usually divided into three grades, with each grade
 
having i
ts own teacher and its own classroom. The 1
962 Summer Session was an
 
exception, having only two classes and two teachers, but it was a last-minute
 
arrangement because of the serious illness of one of the teachers who had been
 
teaching for the last seventeen years.

seven, after they have learned to read and write. The first grade usually has
 
the seven- and eight-year-olds who are just beginning and who have had no
 
previous experience with the Czech language.
 
The second grade has the nine- and ten-year-olds.  Since many of the
 
children come from families where all the children attend the school when they
 
are old enough, this middle level covers the children who have been introduced
 
to the language the year before, but who are still very elementary in their
 
skills and have almost no recall of the prior year s vocabulary. Sometimes, a
 
9
 
bright nine- or ten-year-old who has not attended before is put into the
 
second grade if it appears that he or she can catch up to the second level
 
during tu e  fi rs t  w e e k,  when the last year's lessons are reviewed.
 
The most advanced students are in the third grade. They are usually
 
eleven- through thirteen-year-olds. If a s
tudent s
tarts at age seven and
 
attends the school each year, he or she will stay in the third grade for three
 
or four years.  Students learn most of their language skills and vocabulary in
 
this grade. They use the same grammar as in the previous grades, they repeat
 
the same vocabulary year after year, and cover some basic history and geography
 
of Czechoslovakia.
 
Students from all three grades learn Czech songs. The students gather each
 
day for a half hour to sing together. During the last two weeks of the session
 
the s
tudents practice together for the program that will be presented on the
 
last night.
 
The t
ext, Prvni Citanka, (First Reader) i
s a very basic grammar and
 
vocabulary book. It has only simple sentences, and its content is devoid of any
 
political or religious connotation.\ hjs is the only text provided for the
 
students and teachers by the school board. It is used all the way through by
 
all three grades and there i
s no workbook or supplemental material. It is up to
 
each individual teacher to cover the parts of the text appropriate for each
 
level. It is also up to the teacher to decide how to present the material to
 
thei'
tudents. The board gives them no guidelines, nor does it set any
 
s
tandards for proficiency for today's s
tudents. I
t is solely up to the teachers
 
whether they will give tests or require levels of accomplishment.
 
One additional item has been handed down
 
Since the  teachers are basically left  to their own devices in teaching
 
their classes,  it might be pertinent to cite what the daily schedule is  in each
 
class. The teacher for the first and second grades for the  1982 session is
 
Leona Kaplan. After the pledge is recited,  the children are greeted in Czech.
 
Then they recite some sayings together, along with the colors, the days of the
 
week,  the months,  and the numbers from one through ten.  Next,  the two grades
 
separate. While Mrs. Kaplan works with the first grade,  the second grade
 
copies the vocabulary for the day from the board,  looks up the meanings of the
 
words in the dictionary,  and reviews the lesson from the day before.  If they
 
finish all this early,  they are allowed to get some paper and draw whatever
 
they wish. Meantime, the first grade learns its vocabulary for that day.  A
 
list of perhaps  six words is read,  pronounced correctly,  translated,  and
 
discussed. Mrs.  Kaplan tries to associate each word with something that  the
 
1
I
 
children will remember. After this session, while she works with the second
 
grade, the first graders copy the new vocabulary words into their
 
notebooks, along with the translation. Later they are given a list of t
Ine
 
Czech words and are expected to match up the Czech word with the Englis
 
word. Another time they may be given the Czech word and have t
o write it  out
 
correctly. These tests ware graded by Mrs. Kaplan. She takes a moment
 
to discuss each test paper with each s
tudent; mistakes are corrected and
 
discussed. Basically, the same is done with the second grade, although they
 
can work with eight or nine words at one time. Being more advanced, they are
 
also asked t
o write sentences.
 
About halfway through the morning the first and second grades join the
 
third graders in their classroom to sing together. After they come back the
 
younger children are given a short break to walk around or play a game in their
 
classroom. Both grades then go over the previous day's lesson, trying to
 
remember all of the words and their meanings without looking them up.
 
Mrs. Kaplan does a good job working with two grades at once. She has
 
taught in the public school system for over twenty-five years, starting  her
 
teaching career in a one-room country school where she became familiar with
 
teaching children of all ages together in one room and keeping them all working
 
at their individual levels. The Czech school was lucky to have her as one of
 
the teachers for 1982, when they needed to combine two grades into one
 
classroom.
 
1
2
 
The teacher for the third grade during the 1
982 session was Rose Drymi.
 
This year the third grade also included some younger students who would
 
ordinarily be in second grade, students that had been in second grade last year
 
and were more advanced and older. There were also two twelve-year-olds who had
 
never gone to Czech school before but who were t
oo old to be put in to the
 
class with young children. Mrs. Drymi is an experienced teacher in the Czech
 
school; this was her twenty-fifth year teaching, so she was very capable of
 
handling such a diversified group.
 
The third grade also starts its day with the Pledge of Allegiance. The
 
teacher greets the students in Czech and they return the greeting. All students
 
work together. First, they review the  lesson from the day before and t
rien they
 
read day's lesson. Students write the translations into their notebooks.
 
Pronunciation is stressed. Each day's lesson covers at least two pages in the
 
grammar. Students then go to the board and write sentences, all in Czech, using
 
the vocabulary they already know and incorporating the new words in the day's
 
lesson. The students read their own sentences. The teacher helps to correct the
 
sentence so that the endings of the words agree in gender and number and the
 
students  write the corrected sentences in their notebooks. At the end of the
 
/
 
summer session third grade students recite some of their best sentences as part
 
of the program, so the lessons help prepare them. Mrs. Drymi makes the classes
 
interesting by having the s
tudents participate in various ways. One day she
 
will have the class converse with each other in an impromptu scenario;  another
 
day she has the class work on geography and recalls some of her experiences
 
growing up in Czechoslovakia or discusses history with them.  I
t i
s a real
 
challenge to keep her s
tudents learning.
 
Teachers
 
•ien the school b
egan between three and six teachers conducted the classes
 
ch grade had a teacher. In addition, there was the music teacher (usually
 
Lnist), a handwork instructor for the girls, sometimes a woodworking
 
her, and sometimes a dance instructor.
 During some years the teacher o  -
 
dance or music would also teach a specific grade. In the course of the
 
school's first sixty years approximately forty teachers participated in the i
ts
 
programs. Some teachers taught for many years and others just for a year or
 
two.
 
The roster of teachers
. ±
the high quality of instructors chosen. There
 
were not only leading citizens of the Czech community in Cedar Rapids but
 
native-born Czechs who had been well educated in the mother country. Among the
 
teachers were five editors of Czech-language  newspapers and magazines, a poet,
 
at least two executives, two college  professors, and a physician. As members
 
of Cedar Rapids' Czech community, they were very active in the cultural
 
organizations, drama groups, fraternal organizations, and different religious
 
organizations. Their students had strong role models to look up t
o, as well as
 
good teachers.
 
The teachers were always appointed to the positions. The Women's School
 
Board selected the teachers and provided their salaries from 1890 to 1905. In
 
1
905 the Ustredni Matice (Czech School Board) was formed. Teachers were then
 
appointed by that body, as they still are today.
 
In the lQ*tg-
, history o
f the C
zech s
chool in Cedar Rapids, extending some
 
1
12 years, there have been a total o
f less than seventy teachers. Of these,
 
twenty-five have t
aught in the last f
ifty years. The t
rend during the second
 
half o
f the school's history has been t
o find qualified teachers and keep them
 
t
eaching a
s long a
s they are able, which provides continuity f
or t
he
 
curriculum. The teachers have been able t
o change and adapt over the years, as
 
t
heir s
tudents changed, s
o t
here have been few problems.
 
Over the years the school board has maintained a high standard of quality
 
when appointing i
ts t
eachers. Currently, only three t
eaching positions exist.
 
The board s
till tries t
o find teachers who are native speakers and who have a
 
certain l
evel of education. The t
eachers are also c
ommunity leaders, active in
 
ethnic organizations. When a native-born teacher i
s not available the board
 
chooses individuals with a fluency in t
he mother t
ongue, excellent
 
pronunciation, and a certain level of writing skills. To date, all teachers
 
born in the United S
tates have been f
rom families where Czech was their f
irst
 
language. There i
s no training program for these teachers; they either learn
 
from other t
eachers or r
ely on t
heir own t
eaching b
ackground.

but no longer spoke it;  only the grandparents spoke the mother t
ongue. In the
 
1970s the parents no longer even understood the mother tongue; the grandparents
 
were the only ones who either s
till spoke Czech or at least understood it.
 
By the 1960s it was common for parents to intermarry into the American
 
community. They had grown up in the 1
940s and 1
950s, when it was not popular t
o
 
identify with an ethnic group. Their children usually attended the school only
 
because of pressure from the grandparents, who wanted the future generations to
 
keep up the heritage of their ancestors.
 
The lowest ebb of enrollment in the school was reached in the late 1
960s
 
and early 1970s. Part of this may have been due to the fact that the post-War,
 
baby-boom generation was putting off having children. Lack of interest in
 
anything ethnic and apathy in general among the young adult generation were
 
also contributing factors.
 
A revival of interest in the country's ethnic heritiage occurred with the
 
focus on history generated by preparations for the Bicentennial. Studying one's
 
own genealogy became very popular. The interest in genealogy increased even
 
more after the country was introduced to Roots. 
Today, the teachers note that the students might mention that their family
 
name is Czech, or that their grandparents are Czech. They may also tell people
 
that they attend Czech school to learn a second language and find out about
 
their heritage. The s
tudents are definitely interested. Their approach to the
 
classes i
s quite different today, however. Most now come from schools where the
 
open class concept has been used, or tried, and they lack discipline. They must
 
1
6
 
be challenged, their interest must be captured before they listen and work.
 
They are much more independent than past generations of students and there i
s
 
no automatic respect for the teacher. Today the t
eacher must earn their
 
respect.
 
All three teachers have noticed the change in the independence of the
 
students. The children come back year after year only if they want to; neither
 
parents nor grandparents can "force" them to attend. Often during the course of
 
the session the teachers watch for progress,  see what appears to be little
 
improvement (and sometimes little interest), and wonder "how it will come out
 
this year." What will the program look like at the end of the session? Will any
 
of the children come back next year? Then the last day comes and so do the
 
surprises.
 
This year the program went off very well. All the parents were very
 
pleased, as were the community members who attended the program. The children
 
did a fine job. The Czech school still thrives. There is again nope for next
 
year. The teachers breathe a sigh of relief.
 
The teachers learned some additional things from their students this year.
 
First, the third grade teacher who was very ill and not able to teach was
 
missed by the students. Those who knew her even tape-recorded a message to her.
 
They wished her a speedy recovery and told her about what was going on that she
 
was missing. In the course of the conversation it came out that the third grade
 
students had applied peer pressure t
o one of their members who was especially
 
1
7
 
disruptive in the third grade, warning him to either stop it or be "beat up .
 
I
t seems that there i
s some standard of behavior that even the students
 
themselves desire.
 
This year's third grade teacher, Mrs. Dryml, also learned something from
 
her students. This was her twenty-fifth year teaching in Czech school. On the
 
morning of the last day her students made arrangement to come to the school at
 
7
:30 A.M.  to decorate her room for a special surprise party. I
t was kept a
 
secret from her. The other teacher, Mrs. Kaplan, was asked to help them keep i
t
 
secret, b
.t they invited her and her class to attend. One of the students,  the
 
oldest b
oy, baked three cakes for the party. The oldest girl t
ook care of most
 
of the other details and bought a gift. The students were all in on the event
 
and each helped in some way.  I
t was a complete surprise and a very happy one.
 
The idea came from the students, who also carried it out, which shows a lot
 
about how they regard the school and teachers, even today.
 
School Administration
 
The formation of the Ustredni Matice (Czech School Board) dates to 1905,
 
when the school building had been built and  ongoing support was needed to
 
maintain
 
the program and the physical building.

The establishment of a school
 
that contributed to the support of the school a
 
There are currently sixteen members on the school
 
fraternal, athletic, and cultural organizations in
 
Cedar Rapids. Each member has one vote. Since most financing comes from
 
non-tuition
 
bulk of the
 
sources, the organizations represented on the board account for the
 
necessary funding. The only fund-raising done during the year is
 
1
8
 
the selling of tickets to the Ice Cream Social, which preceeds the annual
 
student program and graduation ceremony; it is held on the last Friday evening
 
of the summer session.
 
The budget for the summer session during the last few years has been
 
approximately $1,000. The largest percentage of the budget goes for the
 
teachers' salaries. The two teachers for the 1
982 session each received a
 
salary of $300 and 20 cents a mile t
o cover their commute to and from school.
 
The second largest amount of the budget is spent on bus rentals for the one
 
field trip that the classes take each year. This year that cost was minimal
 
because the children were taken on a picnic to a nearby park. In other years
 
the field trip has been a more extensive venture; two years ago the children
 
/  went to .Spillville, Iowa, the town where the famous Czech composer
 
Antonin Dvorak spent his time while visiting the United States. In addition t
o
 
salary and field trip expenses, the school also provides textbooks, paper, and
 
pencils for the students. Some new copies of the textbook were purchased in
 
1
982 to replenish some of the worn out texts.
 
There are no longer any costs for maintenance of a school building since
 
it was sold in the 1
950s. Classes for the summer session are now held in one of
 
the public schools on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids. The 1982 location was
 
Grant School. The Cedar Rapids Community School Board is very helpful each year
 
in providing free space in one of its school buildings for, three classes to be
 
held each morning during the course of the summer term
7he cooperation of
 
the school district i
s greatly appreciated by the Czech community.

In addition to financing, the school board has full authority over the
 
entire program.  It selects the teachers, c
hooses the curriculum materials,
 
provides any supplementary materials such as dictionaries, maps, paper, and
 
pencils, and decides on the dates of the Summer Session,  its location, and what
 
type of field trip to undertake.
 
Students
 
The oldest student interviewed about her days at Czech school was Martha
 
Kralik, age ninety. She attended classes between 1898 and 1905. Born in the
 
United States to a Czech family, her grandparents were among the first Czech
 
families to settle in the area in the 1850s. Czech was her first language and
 
the language spoken in her home. She remembers that she and her sister both
 
attended Czech school. They both went to all three grades, participated in
 
various programs and plays, sang, and danced. The girls learned lacemaking,
 
knitting, and embroidery. She described the classes in all three grades as
 
being very formal. Students had to meet high standards set by s
trict teachers.
 
Teachers were respected and liked. The grammar  4
 she' used, Mluvnice Ceska
  
(Czech Grammar), has been passed down in her family. Published in the United
 
States in 1
881, it was written for Czechs in America. It lists a vocabulary of
 
one thousand basic words. The preface i
t
r
 that any student who masters
 
the basics presented in the grammar will have a good knowledge of the Czech
 
language. Martha Kralik clearly remembers that she never graduated from Czech
 
school because she was not able to meet some level of proficiency that had been
 
set at the time. This is very interesting because even today, at age ninety,
 
she speaks a very clear and educated Czech. She is bilingual; her English is
 
very good and spoken without accent. Mrs. Kralik married a newly arrived Czech
 
20
 
immigrant, Joseph Kralik, and they were both very active in the Czech community
 
all of their lives. Martha Kralik served on the executive boards of many
 
organizations and made a real contribution to the ethnic community. She also
 
sent her daughters to Czech school and encouraged their active participation in
 
the Czech community. Her two great-grandsons are enrolled in the Czech school
 
today.
 
Edward R
.  Kuba attended the Czech school in the late 1
910s and early
 
1920s. He was born in Cedar Rapids t
o a Czech family. His grandparents on one
 
side were members of one of the first Czech families to-
-settle-in-the- area in
 
the. 1850s, and one of his grandfathers served in the Civil War. Czech was his
 
first language and it was the language spoken in thetr
' T
home. He attended all
 
three school grades and remembers his teachers, even the violin teacher.
 
Some of his fellow students were from newly
 
'arrived families, others were the second generation t
o attend the school. All
 
of the teachers were native born and were also very active in the Czech
 
community. Picnics were real events. He remembers that the Ice Cream Social was
 
an established event at the end of each Summer Session. Mr. Kuba did gr. :
 
from the school, but remembers that the standards were quite high. He i
-
bilingual, speaking both languages without trace of a y accent. Today, he is a
 
semi-retired business man, still serving the Czech community as a funeral
 
director. Throughout his adult years he has been active in the ethnic community
 
and in the American community in many different organizations. He has
 
maintained his Czech school affiliation by serving on the school board from the
 
1930s to present. As a young man and a new school board member, he remembers
 
that one of his first jobs was to raise money from local businesses for the Ice
 
Cream Social. He recollects that, even in the Depression years, i
t was still
 
2
1
 
possible to raise funds for this event because people always are willing to
 
-.
 -
...
 
share and give something -cw
'ards "the children". He continues his fund-raising
 
activities today. For the last six years he has been the president of the Czech
 
School Board.
 
There are many former students now living in Cedar Rapids who attended the
 
Czech School in the 1920s and 1930s. Many are now retired and have become
 
active in the Czech community. In fact, they are the same people that are
 
keeping up the traditions today —the leaders of various fraternal
 
organizations, athletic groups, and social, religious, and cultural groups.
 
Czech businessmen who have renovated their businesses in the old neighborhood
 
and created the successful Czech Village area are former Czech school students.
 
The Czech Heritage Foundation, with over 800 members, has a board with a high
 
percentage of former s
tudents. It is clear, therefore,
 that the school has
 
played a major role in keeping the language and the culture of the Czechs alive
 
for over a hundred years, especially considering that the last major influx of
 
immigrants was in the 1920s.
 
Students enrolled in the school in the 1
920s started to differ from the
 
earlier students because they were growing up more in the American community,
 
while still being a part of the Czech community. The daughter of Martha Kralik,
 
Martha McGrew, who attended the Czech school, still remembers that, outside of
 
1
'
 
the Czech community, the students did not discuss the fact that they attended
 
an ethnic school. As members of an ethnic group, even though they had been born
 
here and some families had lived in this country for several generations, they
 
2
2
 
were considered second-class citizens. Mrs. McGrew is proud of her heritage and
 
has retained her Czech language ability over the years, even though she married
 
a non-Czech and lived on the West Coast for most of her married l
ife.
 
Mildred Libal Drahovzal also attended the school in the 1
920s. As a
 
student, she remembers that she was teased by American students and called
 
various names.  She distinctly remembers t
-ha
 he reserlted gcLtng. to Czech schoc
 
during the last couple of years. This attitude did not seem to affect her
 
learning, however, for she is bilingual in Czech and English and speaks both
 
without any trace of accent. She is also proficient in the written language.
 
Over the years she has been active in the Czech community and has made a major
 
contribution to many of its organizations. In addition, she has served the
 
Czech school in three different capacities--as a member and president of the
 
Damska Matice (Women's School Board), as secretary of the Ustredni Matice
 
(Czech School Board) for several years, and as a teacher in the Czech school
 
for seventeen years.
 
John Vosatka was also a student in the 1
920s, but his wife Ruth was not.
 
Both were from Czech families and Czech was their first language. John was
 
sent to Czech school by his parents, but Ruth was taught Czech at home by her
 
mother. Today, both speak Czech very well and both read Czech, but while John
 
can write Czech, Ruth cannot. Mrs. Vosatka attributes this difference to the
 
fact that John attended a formal school, whereas she was taught by her mother
 
from a reader and did not get much practice writing the language. Her parents
 
attended a Czech church for which the sermons and hymns were all Czech, as were
 
the prayer books, so they assumed that this would be enough to learn the
 
23
 
language. Formal schooling does appear to make a difference, however. In the
 
case of their own children, the Vosatkas chose to send them to Czech school.
 
Today, one of their grandchildren i
s also enrolled in the school.
 
During the course of the Summer Session the third grade children were
 
asked why they attend the school. Most agreed that they wish to learn abou
 
their Czech heritage. Several indicated that they wish to learn a second
 
language--the language of their grandparents. As has been stated earlier, the
 
children are there because they want to be there.
 
One of the boys in the second grade, Chris Ransom, the grandson of the
 
Vosatkas, is attending for the first t
ime. Last year his grandparents took him
 
to the Ice Cream Social and the graduation program. He decided that he would
 
like to go to Czech school to learn the language of his grandparents after he
 
saw the students sing and recite. His parents were surprised. His mother
 
attended
hen she was his age, in the 1950s, but had married a non-Czech.  She
 
is aware of her heritage, and eve  und
ands Czech, but she was not going to
 
automatically send her sons to Czech school. After Chris indicated on his own
 
that he wished to attend the older boy was asked if he would like to go also;
 
he chose not to. Chris is a good student and learned his vocabulary quickly. He
 
comes home and practices some of his new words on his older brother and his
 
father, both of whom have no knowledge of the Czech language. Chris is nine
 
years old and will continue attending Czech school. He is proud of his second
 
language ability.  It should be added that Chris had to make a special effort to
 
attend because there was a conflict in time schedule with his regular swimming
 
lessons. There were several early morning swimming lessons that he chose to
 
miss because he wanted the extra time t
o spend in Czech school.
 
24
 
The s
tudents who attend today live in all areas of Cedar Rapids, not just
 
in the southwest neighborhood that has been traditionally the Czech area. Most
 
of the year they have no contact with anything Czech. Their best friends are
 
from the American community. The Czech influence i

David and James Hruska are brothers, currently attending the third grade.
 
They have a Czech last name, one that is especially hard to pronounce.  Lt—w
-a --
t
,heir parents who decided to send them to Czech school, at least to start the
 
so that they would be aware of their heritage. David is older. This year he was
 
old enough to graduate, if he chose t
o, or continue for one more year. He
 
finally chose to continue next year. He is very interested in learning the
 
language, to the extent that he has made plans to attend a university where
 
Czech is offered as a foreign language. In addition t
o an interest in language,
 
David loves music and plays several instruments. He has become familiar with
 
all types of Czech music, both popular and classical. As part of a field trip
 
with the Czech school in 1
980 to the home in which Antonin Dvorak lived and
 
wrote his music when he visited this country, David was allowed t
o play the
 
organ that Dvorak played. It was an experience he will never forget and has
 
influenced his music since.
 
James is two years younger and has different interests. He plans to attend
 
Czech school for three more years. The boys are quite different, but they share
 
one thing--they are the fourth generation of their family to attend Czech
 
school  and are the great-grandsons of Martha Kralik,  the oldest student
 
interviewed for this s
tudy.

Parents
 
The parents have played the greatest role over the years in the whole
 
history of the Czech school. The school was first organized after the parents
 
chose to take the teaching out of the home and put it into a more form al,
 
structured setting. The mothers banded together and raised funds for the school
 
building through the Da  ka-Ma
 — k
a (Women's School Boardi. After the
 
-
f
.
r Czech School Board was formed the Women's School Board took care of the
 
physical building. Mothers took turns coming to school with a bucket and scrub
 
C
 
brush to wash the floors. After,
the school building was sold the proceeds
 
kt iqere put into a trust. Scholarships are still awarded from this money.
 
Fathers did the repairs and the maintenance of the old building, when they had
 
time. The early years of the Czech school were hard times. Fathers worked from
 
twelve to eighteen hours a day, six days a week to earn enough for their
 
families. They also were drafted and went to war during some of these years.
 
Their role was just as important as that of the mothers J.n-
 th  life of each
 
child, yet it was just not as visible.
 
Parents today still play very important roles in the continuation of the
 
Czech school. They must make time commitments to provide chauffeur service to
 
and from school. Since the families live all over the city, transportation
 
usually requires a total of two hours of driving each day for four weeks! For
 
those parents that do not, or cannot drive, it means the added bother or
 
expense of finding another parent or friend to do the driving for them.
 
W 
One of the parents interviewed was Sharon Hruska, mother o
f David and
 
James and secretary of the 1
982 Czech School Board. She indicated that the
 
f
irst two years that her oldest son David a
ttended the Summer S
ession she did
 
not know how to drive and had t
o provide a driver f
 or David and pay the
 
expenses. This experience was one of t
he factors that influenced h
er decision
 
t
o learn how to drive. She has now been driving her sons t
o Czech school for
 
f
ive years. She admits t
hat i
t has b
een a real c
ommitment on her part. Both �
Ir.
 
and Mrs. Hruska made the decision t
o start their son in Czech school the firsL
 
year t
o let him learn about his heritage. Mr. Hruska comes from a C
zech family
 
and his wife does not, but she has taken a real interest in her sons'
 
activities, their heritage, and their personal family history. She has joined
 
some Czech organizations, and is a representative on the school board from one
 
of the C
zech fraternal lodges. This year she has t
aken on the added
 
responsibility of acting a
s secretary for the board. As a c
-Quzazaece
'parent, she
 
i
s happy t
o serve on the school board because she i
s concerned about the
 
continuation of the school and the quality of the education that her sons
 
receive. She and her husband both monitor the homework each day and discuss the
 
vehe! � day , uring supper with the boys. They involve the boys in a variety of
 
activities in both the ethnic community and mainstream society. They hope that,
 
a
s the boys grow older, they will remember their heritage but involve
 
themselves in both worlds.
 
There can not be said t
o be a "
typical" parent t
oday, but there are
 
monitoring of progress during the s
ession, the driving problems, and the
 
aspirations for her sons' futures are statements that are echoed by other
 
27
 
parents. It is true that the students themselves are the ones who ultimately
 
decide whether or not they will continue t
o attend the Czech school, but it i
s
 
the parents who provide the support system that enables them to do so.
 
Summary
 
The Czech school in Cedar Rapids, Iowa i
s an interesting phenomenon. For
 
over 1
12 years classes have been held for students in a non-sectarian,
 
apolitical, ethnic school to provide language and cultural heritage instruction
 
for each successive new generation. The school is conducted by the best
 
teachers that the Czech society can find. It is supported by the local
 
community and is totally independent of any other Czech school in the United
 
States.
 
Over the years the changes in the curriculum have reflected the changing
 
values of the Czech community that supports it. Under the leadership of its
 
school board the school survives as a separate, dynamic entity, despite the
 
changes within the community and the student body. Its long history stretches
 
from
 the struggle of new immigrants to adapt to a new homeland i
nI4 a point
 
five generations later when there has been total integration into American
 
/ Oc 
iety. Yet the unique ethnic identity of the community still survives. I
t i
s
 
the Czech school that has played one of the major roles in maintaining the
 
cultural identity of each succeeding generation of s
tudents. The Czech school
 
itself was never large. At its height it had just over 200 students in the
 
three grades; at the points of its lowest ebb it was down to a total of fifteen
 
students. But it was able to change its curriculum, change with the times, and
 
28
 
it continues to exist. By h

community -
was able to maintain its cohesiveness, thereby ensuring that future
 
generations will continue to have a unique identity.
 
CZECH SCHOOL -
 CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA

Czechoslovakia i
s a Central European country, composed of two Slavic
 
groups: the Czechs, who represent eighty—five percent of the population,
 
residing mostly in the western half of the country, and the Slovaks, who
 
number fifteen percent, living in the eastern half of the country. Formed
 
as a republic in 1
918, Czechoslovakia has experienced only twenty years
 
of freedom in this century. After the Germans occupied it from 1
938 to
 
1
945, it came under the Communist sphere of influence and is now
 
considered one of the satellite countries of the Soviet Union.
 
The history of the Czechs began fifteen hundred years ago. In the
 
5th century the western part of present day Czechoslovakia was settled by
 
a Slavic tribe led by a man named 4ech (Czech). This tribe chose a land
 
that had rich soil, was abundant in wildlife, and had borders that were
 
very hard to defend.
 
The next fifteen centuries brought few periods of freedom. The
 
capital, Prague, was located in the heart of Europe and was the
 
crossroads between the East and West. The land remained a choice target
 
for invasion. Yet despite many periods of foreign domination, the Czechs
 
were able to keep their own national identity and their own language.
 
The period of greatest Czech emigration to the United States started
 
in the second half of the 19th century. Czechs left their homelands
 
seeking economic freedom in the New World. Some ultimately sought
 
political freedom, others religious freedom, but all knew that these
 
could be achieved through economic freedom. The Czechs who left Europe
 
were literate, had a skill, trade, or occupation, and many were bilingual
 
in Czech and German. All of them arrived with a strong will to succeed.
 
The first Czech families reached Cedar Rapids in 1852. Iowa was
 
still a new territory, and these were pioneer families. The settlers
 
pooled all their resources  Families often shared their homes with newly
 
2
 
arrived relatives or with other Czech families. They spoke Czech in the
 
home and parents taught their children to read and write their mother
 
tongue. Children learned English in school and in the community.
 
Iowa achieved statehood in 1861. To promote the settling of the
 
state, residents set up the Iowa State Immigration Agency. This agency
 
actively encouraged new immigrants to write to their native lands and
 
suggest to their relatives and neighbors that they emigrate to Iowa. The
 
agency published travel handbooks in foreign languages, had agents in
 
various European port cities, and had an office in New York to help the
 
new arrivals make direct connections to Iowa. This network greatly
 
increased the number of Czechs who settled in the state. According to
 
the 1870 census there were 1
,780 Czechs who had been born in Europe
 
living in Linn County.
 
As the Czech population grew the ethnic community started to
 
organize itself. Czech settlers founded several fraternal organizations
 
to aid the newcomers and help them cope with loss of life and property.
 
They built churches, both Catholic and Protestant, and started a
 
Czech-language newspaper. The community established several cultural
 
organizations, including a reading society with its own Czech library and
 
a dramatic society. Czechs also started a savings and loan to aid
 
newcomers in buying property.
 
History of the Czech School
 
At some point during the 1
9th century the responsibility for
 
teaching the mother tongue shifted from the family to the community,
 
which organized a school. The first mention of the school is at an
 
observance of Jan Hus day —July 6, 1870 —when the Reading Society records
 
note that one of the speakers that day was John B
. Suster, a teacher at
 
the Czech school. The actual date on which the school started is not
 
known, but by July 1
870 the school in operation.

From the Reading Society records and the Czech newspaper one learns
 
that the Czech school was held on Saturday and Sunday during the year and
 
included a daily session for five weeks during the summer. The location
 
of the school varied between the Monroe school and the Reading Society
 
Hall during the years 1
870 to 1
901.
 
/
 
By 1
890 the enrollment was large enough to consider establishing a
 
separate school building. A group of mothers calling themselves the
 
Damska Matice Skolsk4 (Women's School Board) joined together to start
 
raising funds. Over the next ten years the  proceeds of bazaars and
 
fund-raising programs augmented the fund. Once there was enough money for
 
the structure, one of the leading businessmen in Cedar Rapids, F
. W.
 
Severa, donated all of the furniture for the three classrooms and the
 
library. The Czech school formally dedicated the building on January 1
,

Classes and Curriculum
 
The Czech school was non-sectarian and free. Children were divided
 
into three grades, based on age and skills. All grades learned to read,
 
write, and speak the Czech language. The first grade started with the
 
grammar, using a text published in this country and written specifically
 
for students from Czech families who spoke Czech in the home. They
 
covered the first section of the book, learning the basic alphabet, the
 
three genders, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and verbs. History was read
 
to them and they also learned to sing Czech songs and recite poems.
 
Second graders continued with the basic grammar. They learned
 
sentence structure, how to make the gender, number, and case of words
 
agree, and how to write compositions. They read for themselves the
 
history that had been read to them as first graders and continued singing
 
Czech songs. Their reader included poetry, which they memorized. They
 
studied the geography of their native land and its native dances, which
 
they performed in various programs. Second graders also took part in
 
plays.
 
4
 
Third grade students were expected to reach a certain level of
 
proficiency in reading and grammar, as well as history and geography. No
 
student received a diploma and graduated without having satisfactorily
 
proven a proficiency in all the required skills.
 
In addition to the set curriculum for the three grades, children
 
were divided into groups by age and sex and taught etiquette and
 
comportment. Boys learned woodworking and woodcarving. Girls learned
 
knitting, lacemaking, and embroidery. Violin lessons were also available
 
to promising young students.
 
In the 1870s, when the formal Czech school was first organized in
 
the United States, the school system in the mother country consisted of a
 
basic elementary school of four grades. All children started this
 
schooling and many finished all four years. Those who could, attended at
 
least three years. Such schooling was available even in the small
 
villages. Children who stopped after three years were from families in
 
which the children had to start earning money at age nine. This basic
 
elementary school system accounted for the high literacy rate of the
 
Czech immigrants.
 
The next level of education was the gymnasium. Children had to go to
 
towns to acquire that level of education, and families had to have the
 
money to send them; therefore, the advanced schooling was for more gifted
 
or wealthy children.
 
The university was the final level of higher education. Charles
 
University, founded in Prague in 1348, provided graduate training for
 
qualified students who passed entrance tests and who wished to go on to
 
study science, mathematics, medicine, law, literature, etc.
 
The immigrants who settled in the United States decided to provide a
 
curriculum of at least the three basic grades, plus music and dance.
 
They realized that the pupils attending the Czech school would also be
 
attending American public school, so the three-year program in their
 
5
 
native language needed t
o concentrate only on language and culture. The
 
three-year system also provided the option for the child to help the
 
family a
fter age nine.
 
Around the turn of the century children began to attend the Czech
 
school for more than three years. The school classes were held on
 
Saturdays and Sundays throughout the year, with a special, concentrated
 
Summer Session of five weeks. The schedule proved not to be enough to
 
meet the proficiency expected of each grade level, however. There appears
 
to have been no stigma attached to any pupil's needing to attend the
 
school classes for more than three years. With each succeeding generation
 
it became more common to have a child attend classes for more than three
 
years, even up to age thirteen or fourteen, when they would be gridti tin-
from American public school. Graduation from the Czech school was
 
encouraged no matter how long it took to achieve the desired language
 
proficiency.
 
The Czech school was free. A token tuition for the Summer Session
 
was charged--50 cents per child, if the family could afford it —but a
 
child could attend even if the parents did not pay the tuition. After
 
World War II the school raised the tuition to $1.00, and in the 1970s to
 
$2.00.
 
Major changes in the curriculum materials have occurred only twice
 
in the last forty years. Once the students started to come from families
 
which spoke both English and Czech, the school changed the basic grammar
 
to a more simplified edition with a smaller vocabulary and discontinued
 
the reader. In the 1
960s it substituted a second edition of the grammar
 
text, which is used currently. It includes a basic vocabulary of about
 
three hundred words, and there is no attempt to deal with anything beyond
 
basic sentence structure.
 
Board members —students once themselves--who became aware of the
 
shifting role of the school made the decisions concerning the change of
 
the curriculum materials. Once it was no longer possible to expect a
 
certain level of proficiency from the students, especially since fewer
 
6
 
and fewer came from Czech-speaking homes,  t
ho bonrl  sh ifted  the
 
priorities of the school from language maintenance to basic 1ari,
 
familiarity and cultural maintenance. Present-day students are introduced
 
to a second language--the language of their cultural heritage.
 
The board chooses teachers carefully, based on their language
 
ability. Native-born teachers are still preferred, when available. The
 
board bases the selection of American-born teachers on their fluency and
 
correct pronunciation. In the last few years two American-born teachers
 
at the school came from Czech-speaking parents, and both knew Czech
 
before they spoke English.
 
Minutes kept since 1970 indicate that the board now schedules four
 
meetings a year —in March, April, May, and July. During the first three
 
sessions the board makes plans for the coming year's Summ er Session.
 
Their last meeting is held after the school session to get a progress
 
report and to pay the teachers. In the past they have conducted the
 
meetings  in Czech and all the notes made prior to June 1982 were in
 
Czech. In the last few years they have conducted the meetings conducted
 
in English, but the Czech minutes were read as written. They elected a
 
new secretary  in June 1
982 to take over the position from Mrs.
 
Drahovzal, who was too ill to continue. The new secretary, Sharon Hruska,
 
is a new board member and the parent of two students. She has no Czech
 
background and does not speak Czech, so she is keeping the notes in
 
English. To keep up past traditions, however, after the notes are read in
 
English, Board President Edward Kuba translates the notes into Czech for
 
the members present. As the times change, the board also changes and
 
adapts.
 
Today Summer Session classes are usually divided into three grades,
 
with each grade having its own teacher and its own classroom. The 1982
 
Summer Session was an exception, having only two classes and two
 
teachers, but it was a last-minute arrangement because of the serious
 
illness of one of the teachers who had been teaching for the last
 
seventeen years.

Children are divided by age and by ability. Usually children start
 
at age seven, after they have learned to read and write. The first grade
 
usually has the seven- and eight-year-olds, who are just beginning and
 
who have had no previous experience with the Czech language.
 
The second grade has the nine- and ten-year-olds. Since many of the
 
children come from families where all the children attend the school when
 
they are old enough, this middle level covers the children who have been
 
introduced to the language the year before, but who are still very
 
elementary in their skills and have almost no recall of the prior year's
 
vocabulary. Sometimes, the school places a bright nine- or ten-year-old
 
who has not attended before into the second grade, if it appears that he
 
or she can catch up to the second level during the first week, when the
 
last year's lessons are reviewed.
 
The most advanced students are
 
eleven- through thirteen-year-olds.
 
attends the school each year, he or
 
three or four years. Students learn
 
in the third grade. They are usually
 
If a student starts at age seven and
 
she will stay in the third grade fr
 
most of their language skills an
 
vocabulary in this grade. They use the same grammar as in the previous
 
grades, repeat the same vocabulary year after year, and cover some basic
 
history and geography of Czechoslovakia.
 
Students from all three grades learn Czech songs. The students
 
gather each day for a half hour to sing together. During the last two
 
weeks of the session the students practice together for the program that
 
will be presented on the last night.
 
The text, Prvnt gitanka (First,
ader), is a basic grammar and
 
sentences, devoid of any political
 
religious connotations. This is the only text provided by the school
 
board; there is no workbook or supplemental material. All three grades
 
use it. Each individual teacher covers the parts of the text appropriate
 
the level being taught. It is also up to the teacher to decide how to
 
present the material to the students; the board gives them no guidelines,
 
vocabulary book. It has only simple
 
i
 
V
 
C
,
 
8
 
nor does it set any standards for proficiency for the students. It is
 
left solely to the teachers' discretion whether they will give tests or
 
require levels of accomplishment.
 
The only other materials provided for the teachers are song sheets
 
(without the musical scores). One additional item has been handed down
 
from teacher to teacher--a poster with the translation of the Pledge of
 
Allegiance (Su b Vlajce). Every morning the classes start with the Pledge
 
of Allegiance in Czech. This is an exact, word by word, translation. Some
 
of the words are long and difficult to pronounce in Czech, but all of the
 
children memorize it. This custom has been a part of Czech school as long
 
as anyone can remember. The pledge was translated and introduced in the
 
United States in 1
893 in the book Youths Companion. The Czech school
 
probably adopted it soon after that and has recited it ever since. The
 
continued recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in Czech is interesting
 
since it indicates the strong feeling for their adopted homeland that has
 
ex stec
mcrcT Czech 1mmi rjnts.
 
The teacher for the first and second grades for the 1
982 session is
 
Leona Kaplan. After reciting the pledge she greets the children in Czech.
 
They then recite some sayings together, along with the colors, the days
 
of the week, the months, and the numbers from one through ten. Next, the
 
two grades separate. While Mrs. Kaplan works with the first grade, the
 
second grade copies the vocabulary for the day from the board, looks up
 
the meanings of the words in the dictionary, and reviews the lesson from
 
the day before. If they finish all this early, they may get some paper
 
and draw whatever they wish. Meanwhile, the first grade learns its
 
vocabulary for that day.  They read, pronounce, translate, and discuss a
 
list of perhaps six words. Mrs. Kaplan tries to associate each word with
 
something that the children will remember. After this session, while she
 
works with the second grade, the first graders copy the new vocabulary
 
words into their notebooks, along with the translation. Later they
 
receive a list of the Czech words and must match up the Czech word with
 
the English. Another time they may receive the Czech word and have to
 
write it out correctly. Mrs. Kaplan grades the tests. She takes a moment
 
to discuss each test paper with each student, pointing out and explaining
 
9
 
mistakes. She follows the same basic procedure with the second grade,
 
although they can work with eight or nine words at one time. Being more
 
advanced,  t
hey are also a
sked to write sentences.
 
About halfway through the morning the first and second grades joi
 
the third graders in their classroom to sing together. After they come
 
back the younger children get a short break to walk around or play
 
a game in their classroom. Both grades then go over the previous day's
 
lesson, trying to remember all of the words and their meanings without
 
looking them up.
 
Mrs. Kaplan does a good job working with two grades at once. She has
 
taught in the public school system for over twenty-five years, starting
 
her teaching career in a one-room country school where she became
 
familiar with teaching children of all ages in one room and keeping them
 
all working at their individual levels. The Czech school was lucky to
 
have her as one of the teachers for 1982, when they needed to combine two
 
grades into one classroom.
 
The teacher for the third grade during the 1
982 session was Rose
 
Dryml. In 1982 the third grade included some younger students who would
 
ordinarily be in second grade —students that had been in second grade
 
last year and were more advanced and older. There were also two
 
twelve-year-olds who had never gone to Czech school before but who were
 
too old to be put into the class with the younger children. Mrs. Dryml is
 
an experienced teacher in the Czech school; this was her twenty-fifth
 
year teaching, so she was very capable of handling such a diversified
 
group.
 
The third grade starts its day with the Pledge of Allegiance, too.
 
The teacher greets the students in Czech and they return the greeting.
 
All students work together. First, they review the lesson from the
 
previous day and then they read that day's lesson. Students write the
 
translations into their notebooks. The class stresses pronunciation. Each
 
day's lesson covers at least two pages in the grammar. Students then go
 
to the board and write sentences, all in Czech, using the vocabulary they
 
1
0
 
already know and incorporating the new words from the day's lesson. The
 
students read their own sentences. The teacher helps to correct the
 
sentences so that the endings of the words agree in gender and number and
 
the students write the corrected sentences in their notebooks. At the end
 
of the Summer Session, third grade students recite some of their best
 
sentences as part of the program, so the lessons help prepare them. Mrs.
 
Drymi makes the classes interesting by interacting with the students in
 
various ways. One day she will have the class converse with each other in
 
an impromptu scenario; another day she has the class work on geography,
 
and recalls some of her experiences growing up in Czechoslovakia, or
 
discusses history with them. It is a real challenge to keep her students
 
learning.
 
Teachers
 
When the Czech school began it had between three and s
ix teacher ,
 
Each grade had a teacher, and there was also a music teacher (usually
 
violinist), a handwork instructor for the girls, sometimes a woodworking
 
teacher, and sometimes a dance instructor. During some years the teacher
 
for dance or music would also teach a specific grade. In the course of
 
the school's first sixty years approximately forty teachers participated
 
in its programs. Some teachers taught for many years and others just for
 
a year or two.
 
The roster of teachers over the years demonstrates the high quality
 
of instructors chosen. They included not only leading citizens of the
 
Czech community in Cedar Rapids but native—born Czechs who had been well
 
educated in the mother country. Among the teachers were five editors of
 
Czech language newspapers and magazines, a poet, at least two executives,
 
two college professors, and a physician. As members of Cedar Rapids'
 
Czech community, they were very active in its cultural organizations,
 
drama groups, fraternal organizations, and different religious
 
organizations. Their students had strong role models to look up to as
 
well as good teachers.
 
1

The Women's School Board selected the teachers and provided their
 
salaries from 1890 to 1
905. In 1905 the Ustredni Matice (Czech School
 
Board) was formed. Teachers were then appointed by that body, as they
 
still are today.
 
In the entire long history of the Czech school in Cedar Rapids,
 
extending some 1
12 years, there have been a total of less than seventy
 
teachers. Of these, twenty-five have taught in the last fifty years. The
 
trend during the second half of the school's history has been to find
 
qualified teachers and keep them teaching as long as they are able, which
 
provides continuity for the curriculum. The teachers have been able to
 
change and adapt over the years, as their students changed, so there have
 
been few problems.
 
Over the years the school board has maintained a high standard of
 
quality when appointing its teachers. Currently, only three teaching
 
positions exist. The board still tries to find teachers who are native
 
speakers and who have a certain level of education. The teachers are also
 
community leaders, active in ethnic organizations. When a native-born
 
teacher is not available, the board chooses individuals with a fluency in
 
the mother tongue, excellent pronunciation, and a certain level
 
writing skills. To date, all teachers born in the United States
 
from families where Czech was their first language. There is no
 
of
 
have been
 
training
 
program for teachers; they either learn from other teachers or rely on
 
their own teaching background.
 
Long-term teachers have noted changes in the curriculum and the
 
students. Both Mrs. Drymi and Mrs. Drahovzal, who have taught for
 
twenty-five and seventeen years respectively, have seen a change in Czech
 
fluency among the incoming students. In the 1950s there were still some
 
students who came from families which spoke Czech; either the parents
 
spoke to each other in Czech or one parent spoke to the grandparents. In
 
the 1
960s parents tended to understand Czech but no longer speak it; only
 
the grandparents spoke the mother tongue. By the 1970s the parents no
 
longer even understood the mother tongue; the grandparents were the only
 
family members who either still spoke Czech or at least understood it.
 
By the 1
960s i
t was also common for parents t
o intermarry into the
 
American community. They had grown up in the 1
940s and 1950s, when it was
 
not popular to identify with an ethnic group. Their children usually
 
attended the school only because of pressure from the grandparents, who
 
wanted t
he future generations to keep up the heritage of their ancestors.
 
The l
owest ebb o
f enrollment in the school was reached in the late
 
1
960s and early 1
970s. Part of the reason for low enrollment may have
 
been that the post-War, baby-boom generation was putting off having
 
children. Lack of interest in anything ethnic and general apathy among
 
the young adult generation were also contributing factors.
 
A r
evival of interest in the c
ountry's e
thnic heritage occurred
 
when the preparations for the Bicentennial generated a interest in the
 
country's history. S
tudying one's own genealogy became very popular.
 
The interest in genealogy increased even more after the country was
 
introduced to Roots.
 
Today, the t
eachers say that the students may mention that their
 
family name is Czech or 
 
that their 
,
tit.r
t
ell people that they attend Czech school to learn a second language and
 
find out about their heritage. The students are definitely interested.
 
Their approach to the classes i
s quite different t
oday, however. Most
 
students today come from schools in which the open class concept has been
 
used, or tried, and t
hey lack discipline. They must be challenged, their
 
interest must be captured before they listen and work. They are much more
 
independent than past generations of students and there is no automatic
 
respect for the teacher. Today the teacher must earn their respect.
 
All three teachers have noticed the change in the degree of student
 
independence. The children return t
o the school each year only if they

interest), and wonder how it will come out this year. What will the
 
program look like at the end of the session? Will any of the children
 
come back next year? Then the last day comes and so do the surprises.
 
In 1
982 the concluding program for the Summer Session went very
 
well. All the parents were very pleased, as were the community members
 
who attended the program. The children did a fine job. The Czech school
 
still thrives. There is again hope for next year. The teachers breathe a
 
sigh of relief.
 
The teachers learned some additional things from their students this
 
year. The students missed the former third grade teacher, Mrs. Drahovzal,
 
who was very ill and not able to teach. Those who knew her even
 
tape-recorded a message for her. They wished her a speedy recovery and
 
told her about what was going on that she was missing. In the course of
 
the conversation it came out that the third grade students had applied
 
peer pressure to one of their members who was especially disruptive in
 
class, warning him to either stop it or be beaten up. It seems that there
 
is some standard of behavior that even the students themselves desire.
 
This year's third grade teacher, Mrs. Drymi, also learned something
 
from her students. This was her twenty-fifth year teaching in Czech
 
school. On the morning of the last day her students made arrangement to
 
come to the school at 7
:30 A.M. to decorate her room for a special
 
surprise party. It was kept a secret from her. Students asked the other
 
teacher, Mrs. Kaplan, to help them keep it secret, and they invited her
 
and her class to attend. One of the students, the oldest boy, baked three
 
cakes for the party. The oldest girl took care of most of the other
 
details and bought a gift. The students were all in on the event and each
 
helped in some way. It was a complete surprise and a very happy one. The
 
idea came from the students, who also carried it out, which shows a lot
 
about how they regard the school and teachers, even today.

School Administration
 
The formation of the Ustredni Matice (Czech School Board) dates ts
 
1905, when the school building had been built and ongoing support wn;
 
needed to maintain the program and the physical building. The
 
establishment of a school board gave each Czech group that contributed to
 
the support of the school a vote in its administration. There are
 
currently sixteen members on the school board, representing various
 
fraternal, athletic, and cultural organizations in Cedar Rapids. Each
 
member has one vote. Since most financing comes from non-tuition sources,
 
the organizations represented on the board account for the bulk of the
 
necessary funding. The only fund-raising done during the year is the
 
selling of tickets to the Ice Cream Social, which precedes the annual
 
student program and graduation ceremony; it is held on the last Friday
 
evening of the Summer Session.
 
The budget for the Summer Session during the last few years has been
 
approximately $1,000. The largest percentage of the budget goes for the
 
teachers' salaries. The two teachers for the 1982 session each received a
 
salary of $300 and 20 cents a mile to cover their commute to and from
 
school. The second largest amount of the budget is spent on bus rentals
 
for the one field trip that the classes take each year. This year that
 
cost was minimal because the children were taken on a picnic to a nearby
 
park. In other years the field trip has been a more extensive venture;
 
two years ago the children went to  Spiliville, Iowa, the town where the
 
famous Czech composer Antonin Dvorik spent his time while visiting the
 
United States. In addition to salary and field-trip expenses, the school
 
also provides textbooks, paper, and pencils for the students. Some new
 
copies of the textbook were purchased in 1
982 to replenish some of the
 
worn out texts.
 
There are no longer any costs for maintenance of a school building,
 
since it was sold in the 1950s. Classes for the Summer Session are now
 
held in one of the public schools on the southwest side of Cedar Rapids.
 
The 1982 location was Grant School. The Cedar Rapids Community School
 
Board is very helpful each year in providing free space in one of its
 
1
5
 
school buildings for three classes to be held each morning during the
 
course of the summer term, and Czech community greatly appreciates the
 
cooperation of the school district.
 
In addition to providing financing, the Czech School Board has full
 
authority over the entire program. It selects the teachers, chooses the
 
curriculum materials, provides any supplementary materials, such as
 
dictionaries, maps, paper, and pencils, and decides on the dates of the
 
Summer Session, its location, and the type of field trip to undertake.
 
Students
 
The oldest student interviewed about her days at Czech school was
 
Martha Kralik, age ninety. She attended classes between 1898 and 1905.
 
Born in the United States to a Czech family, her grandparents were among
 
the first Czech families to settle in the area in the 1850s. Czech was
 
her first language and the language spoken in her home. She remembers
 
that she and her sister both attended Czech school. They both went to all
 
three grades, participated in various programs and plays, sang, and
 
danced. The girls learned lacemaking, knitting, and embroidery. She
 
described the classes in all three grades as being very formal. Students
 
had to meet high standards set by strict teachers. Teachers were
 
respected and liked. The grammar she used, Mluvnice
esl 4 (Czech
 )
 
grammar), has been passed down in her family. Published in the United
 
States in 1881, it was written for Czechs in America. It contains a
 
vocabulary of one thousand basic words. The preface states that any
 
student who masters the basics presented in the grammar will have a good
 
knowledge of the Czech language.
 
Martha Kralik clearly remembers that she never graduated from Czech
 
school because she was not able to meet some level of proficiency that
 
had been set at the time. That is interesting because even today, at age
 
ninety, she speaks a clear, educated Czech. She is bilingual; her English
 
is good and spoken without accent.

Mrs. Kralik married a newly arrived Czech immigrant, Joseph Kralik,
 
and they both were active in the Czech community all of their lives.
 
Martha Kralik served on the executive boards of many organizations and
 
made a real contribution to the ethnic community. She also sent her
 
daughters to Czech school and encouraged their active participation in
 
the Czech community. Her two great-grandsons are enrolled in the school
 
today.
 
Edward R. Kuba attended the Czech school in the late 1
910s and early
 
1920s. He was born in Cedar Rapids to a Czech family. His grandparents on
 
one side were members of one of the area's first Czech families, and one
 
of his grandfathers served in the Civil War. Czech was his first language
 
and it was the language spoken in the home. He attended all three school
 
grades and remembers his teachers, even the violin teacher. Some of his
 
fellow students were from newly arrived families, others were the second
 
generation to attend the school. All of the teachers were native born and
 
were also very active in the Czech community. Picnics were real events.
 
He remembers that the Ice Cream Social was an established event at the
 
end of each Summer Session.
 
Mr. Kuba did graduate from the school, but remembers that the
 
standards were quite high. He is bilingual, speaking English and Czech
 
without trace of an accent. Today, he is a semi-retired businessman,
 
still serving the Czech community as a funeral director. Throughout his
 
adult years he has been active in the ethnic and community organizations.
 
He has maintained his Czech school affiliation by serving on the school
 
board from the 1930s to the present. As a young man and a new school
 
board member, he remembers that one of his first jobs was to raise money
 
from local businesses for the Ice Cream Social. He recollects that, even
 
in the Depression years, it was still possible to raise funds for this
 
event because people always are willing to share and give something for
 
"the children". He continues his fund-raising activities today. For the
 
last six years he has been the president of the Czech School Board.

There are many former students now living in Cedar Rapids who
 
attended the Czech School in the 1920s and 1930s. Some are now retired
 
and have become active in the Czech community. In fact, they are the same
 
people that are keeping up the traditions today —the leaders of various
 
fraternal organizations, athletic groups, and social, religious, and
 
cultural groups. Czech businessmen who have renovated their businesses in
 
the old neighborhood and created the successful Czech Village area are
 
former Czech school students. The Czech Heritage Foundation, with over
 
800 members, has a board with a high percentage of former students. It is
 
clear, therefore, that the school has played a major role in keeping the
 
language and the culture of the Czechs alive for over a hundred years,
 
especially considering that the last major influx of immigrants from
 
Czechoslovakia was in the 1
920s.
 
Students enrolled in the school in the 1
920s developed attitudes
 
that were different from those of earlier Czech school students because
 
they were growing up more in the American community, while still being a
 
part of the Czech community. The daughter of Martha Kralik, Martha
 
McGrew, who also attended the Czech school, still remembers that, outside
 
of the Czech community, students did not discuss the fact that they
 
attended an ethnic school. As members of an ethnic group, even though
 
they had been born here and some families had lived in this country for
 
several generations, they were considered second—class citizens. Mrs.
 
McGrew is proud of her heritage and has retained her Czech language
 
ability over the years, even though she married a non—Czech and lived on
 
the West Coast for most of her married life.
 
Mildred Libal Drahovzal also attended the school in the 1
920s. As a
 
student, she remembers, she was teased by American students and called
 
various names. She distinctly recalls her resentment of having to go to
 
Czech school during the last couple of years. Her reluctance did not seem
 
to affect her learning, however, for she is bilingual in Czech and
 
English and speaks both without any trace of an accent. She is also
 
proficient in the written language. Over the years she has been active in
 
the Czech community and has made a major contribution to many of its
 
organizations. In addition, she has served the Czech school in three
 
1
8
 
different capacities--as a member and president of the Damska Matice
 
(Women's School Board), as secretary of the Ustredni Matice (Czech School
 
Board) for several years, and as a teacher in the Czech school for
 
seventeen years.
 
John Vosatka was also a student in the 1
920s, but his wife Ruth was
 
not. Both were from Czech families and Czech was their first language.
 
John's parents sent him to Czech school, but Ruth's mother taught her
 
Czech at home. Today, both speak Czech very well and both read Czech, but
 
John can write Czech and Ruth cannot. Mrs. Vosatka attributes their
 
differing skills to the fact that John attended a formal school, whereas
 
she learned her skills at home from a reader and did not get much
 
practice writing the language. The family attended a Czech church in
 
which the sermons and hymns were all Czech, as were the prayer books. Her
 
parents assumed that regular church attendance would provide enough
 
exposure to learn the language. Formal schooling does appear to make a
 
difference, however. The Vosatkas chose to send their own children to
 
Czech school. Today, one of their grandchildren also attends the school.
 
During the course of the 1982 Summer Session I asked the third grade
 
children why they attend the school. Most agreed that they wish to learn
 
about their Czech heritage. Several indicated that they wish to learn a
 
second language--the language of their grandparents. As has been stated
 
earlier, the children are there because they want to be there.
 
One of the boys in the second grade, Chris Ransom, the grandson of
 
the Vosatkas, is attending for the first time. Last year his grandparents
 
took him to the Ice Cream Social and the graduation program. He decided
 
that he would like to go to Czech school to learn his grandparents'
 
language after he saw the students sing and recite. His parents were
 
surprised. His mother attended Czech school in the 1950s, when she was
 
his age, but married a non—Czech. She is aware of her heritage, and even
 
understands Czech She was not going to automatically send her sons to
 
Czech school, however. After Chris indicated on his own that he wished to
 
attend, they asked their older son if he would like to go also; he chose
 
not to.

Chris is a good student. He learned his vocabulary quickly. When he
 
gets home he practices some of his new words on his father and older
 
brother, neither of whom have any knowledge of the Czech language. Chris
 
is nine years old and plans to continue attending Czech school. He is
 
proud of his ability to speak, read, and write a second language. It
 
should be added that Chris had to make a special effort to attend the
 
school because there was a conflict in time schedule with his regular
 
swimming lessons. He chose to miss several early morning swimming lessons
 
because he wanted the extra time to spend in Czech school.
 
The students who attend Czech school today live in all areas of
 
Cedar Rapids, not just in the southwest neighborhood that has
 
traditionally been the Czech area. Most of the year they have no contact
 
with anything Czech. Their best friends are from the American community.
 
The Czech influence is part of their lives only to the extent that they
 
wish to include it.
 
The Hruska brothers, David and James, currently attend the third
 
grade of the Czech school. They have a Czech family name that is
 
especially hard to pronounce. Their parents decided to send them to Czech
 
school, at least to start them, so that they would be aware of their
 
heritage. In 1982 David, the older brother, was old enough to graduate,
 
if he chose to, or he could continue for one more year. He finally chose
 
to continue next year. He is very interested in learning the language, so
 
much so that he has made plans to attend a university where Czech is
 
offered as a foreign language. In addition to an interest in language,
 
David loves music and plays several instruments. He has become familiar
 
with all types of Czech music, both popular and classical. As part of a
 
field trip with the Czech school in 1980 to the home in which Antonin
 
Dvorak lived and wrote his music when visiting this country, David was
 
allowed to play the organ that Dvorak played. It was an experience he
 
will never forget, and one which has influenced his music since.

James, who is two years younger, has different interests. He plans
 
to attend Czech school for three more years. The boys are quite
 
different, but they share one thing--they are the fourth generation of
 
their family to attend Czech school. They are the great—grandsons of
 
Martha Kralik, the oldest student interviewed for this study.
 
Parents
 
The parents have played the most important role throughout the
 
history of the Czech school. Parents first organized the school after
 
deciding to take teaching out of the home and put it into a more formal,
 
structured setting. Mothers banded together and raised funds for the
 
school building through the Women's School Board. After the Czech School
 
Board was formed the Women's School Board took care of the physical
 
building. The mothers took turns coming to school with a bucket and scrub
 
brush to wash the floors. Fathers did the repairs and the maintenance of
 
the old building, when they had time.
 
The early years of the Czech school were hard times. Fathers worked
 
from twelve to eighteen hours a day, six days a week, to earn enough for
 
their families. They also were drafted and went to war during some of
 
these years. Their role was just as important as that of the mothers in
 
the life of each child, yet it was not as visible. When the school
 
building was sold the proceeds were put into a trust. Scholarships are
 
still awarded from this money.
 
Parents today continue to play a vital role in the Czech school.
 
They must make a time commitment to provide chauffeur service to and from
 
school. Since families live all over the city, transportation usually
 
requires a total of two hours of driving each day for four weeks! For
 
those parents that do not, or cannot, drive it means the added bother or
 
expense of finding another parent or friend to drive for them.

One of the parents interviewed was Sharon Hruska, mother of David
 
and James and secretary of the 1982 Czech School Board. She remembered
 
that during the first two years that her oldest son David attended the
 
Summer Session she did not know how to drive and had to provide a driver
 
for David and pay the expenses. This experience was one of the factors
 
that influenced her decision to learn to drive. She has now been
 
driving her sons to Czech school for five years. She admits that it has
 
required a real time commitment on her part.
 
Mr. and Mrs. Hruska made the decision to start their son in Czech
 
school to let him learn about his heritage. Mr. Hruska comes from a Czech
 
family and his wife does not, but she has taken a real interest in her
 
sons' activities, their heritage, and their family history. She has
 
joined some Czech organizations and represents one of the Czech fraternal
 
lodges on the school board. This year she has taken on the added
 
responsibility of acting as secretary for the board. As a parent, she is
 
happy to serve on the school board because she is concerned about the
 
continuation of the school and the quality of the education that her sons
 
receive.
 
Mrs. Hruska and her husband both monitor the homework each day and
 
discuss the day's events during supper with the boys. They Involve their
 
sons in a variety of activities in both the ethnic community and
 
mainstream society. They hope that, as the boys grow older, they will
 
remember their heritage but enjoy participating in both cultural worlds.
 
There is no  typical" Czech school parent today, but there are many
 
shared concerns. The remarks that Mrs. Hruska made about the daily
 
monitoring of progress, driving problems, and aspirations for her sons'
 
futures are statements that other parents echoed. It is true that the
 
students themselves are the ones who ultimately decide whether or not
 
they will continue to attend the Czech school, but it is the parents who
 
provide the support system that enables them to do so.

Summary
 
The Czech school in Cedar Rapids, Iowa is an interesting phenomenon.
 
For over 1
12 years students have attended classes in a non-sectarian,
 
apolitical, ethnic school which provides language and cultural heritage
 
instruction for each successive new generation. The school is staffed  by
 
the best teachers available. Supported by the local community, it is
 
totally independent of any other Czech school in the United States.
 
Under the leadership of its school board the school survives as a
 
separate, dynamic entity, despite the changes within the community and
 
the student body. Its long history stretches from the struggle of new
 
immigrants to adapt to a new homeland to a point five generations later
 
when there has been total integration into American society. Yet the
 
unique ethnic identity of the community still survives. The Czech school
 
has played a major role in maintaining the cultural identity of each
 
succeeding generation of students.
 
The Czech school was never large. At its height it had just over 200
 
students in the three grades; at the points of lowest attendance it was
 
down to a total of fifteen students. But it has been able to change its
 
curriculum, change with the times, and it continues to exist. By defining
 
its cultural identity, the Czech community has been able to maintain its
 
cohesiveness, thereby ensuring that future generations will continue to
 
have a unique identity.
