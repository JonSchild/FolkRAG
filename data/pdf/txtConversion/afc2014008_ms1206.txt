Dear Ruth Thomas,
 
I hope you remember me,  We met twice at my office -
-
 the Folk Arts Program
 
at the National Endowment for the Arts in Washington, D
.C.  I am at home
 
on a week's leave, so 1
'm writing from my home address.
 
I keep finding myself thinking about our conversation concerning Bermudan
 
traditions, especially in the area of childrens' material.  I had wanted
 
to send you a copy of my book, "Step I
t Down" that I co-authored with a
 
Black l
ady, now deceased, Mrs. Bessie Jones, who knew a great number of
 
traditional childrens musical games and who had, moreover, developed a
 
theoretical s
tructure explaining how tightly entwined the games were with
 
the various stages of childhood socialization,  "Step I
t Down" i
s out of
 
print but will be available some time this fall in paperback.  When i
t
 
finally comes out, r
 will be happy to send you a copy.
 
In the meantime I happened to come across a s
tudy guide I did some twenty
 
years ago (
1) to go with a short film on B
lack childrens games in the Los
 
Angeles area,  The film i
s more interesting than the study guide, it seems
 
to me, but I thought you might l
ike to take a look at the latter to see if
 
any of the repertoire rings a bell in your recollection.  I
t would not surprise
 
me at a
ll to find that Bermudan children play many of the same games as the
 
B
lack children I
've worked with in Georgia, Calfornia, and the District of
 
Columbia.
 
But it would be fun to find out for sure.  I have been thinking about the
 
possibility of taking a sort of combined field-trip and vacation to Bermuda
 
for a week or two this coming January or February perhaps,  Do you think if
 
I came I could get permission to observe on a playground after school an after-
noon or two somewhere
 I would delighted to "pay" for the privilege by bringing
 
along the film I did and doing a little informal talk about i
t if you think
 
any Bermudan educators or classroom teachers would be interested.
 (
And i
t
 
wouldn't hurt my feelings if they weren't! Lots of people are s
ort of unaware
 
of the folklore that surrounds them.)
 
I hope I am not imposing.  This may not be the right time to envision any such
 
project, and you may have too much on your plate to respond right now.  I won't
 
be the s
lightest bit upset if that turns out to be the case; I have a l
ot to do
 
right now myself!
 I
t's just that I find I keep on thinking about it -
-
 perhaps
 
stimulated by that nice book on Bermudan history you gave r
ae that Ive enjoyed
 
so much.  Thank you again.
 
sincerel

Dear Ruth,
 
I
 won't take up our t
ime with more apologies except to tell you that I did go
 
down with a v
irus s
hortly after I got back from Bermuda, and i
t took me rather
 
a l
ong t
ime to surface.  And then when I had rejoined the human race, there were
 
the duties f
acing me t
hat had accumulated during my absence.  Please accept my
 
apologies, a
long with Nick's.  You were such a hospitable hostess, so kind and
 
s
o considerate and so helpful., and so interesting.  I hope someday pou will
 
l
et us return the favor.
 
I enclose a copy of the current Folk Arts guidelines and brochure.  On the f
irst
 
page of the guidelines, you will f
ind the Endowment's statement of purpose that
 
might be of use t
o you.  I think i
t i
s well put and of l
asting quality.  I
 will
 
keep my eyes open f
or other similar s
tatements that you might be able to use
 
and will throw a f
ew more things in when I reach the office in the morning.
 
I
've thought of our visit so often.  What an extraordinarily beautiful place you
 
do l
ive i
n, how lucky you are, and how many interesting problems and possibilities
 
face you.  I
 would s
till l
ove to ply my folkloric trade on your i
sland some day.
 
Maybe i
t can s
till work out -
-
 who knows?  I keep trying to get on part time status
 
here, and maybe in a year or two I can got a bit more t
ime blocked out to investigate
 
those problems that seem to me I could possibly be of help with.  By the way, a friend
 
i
s working on the L
ouisiana version of the Goombay tradition; I s
hall send you his
 
book when i
t comes out.  I do hope you can continue to keep that tradition fresh
 
and meaningful and of l
ocal s
ignificance.  I
t i
s truly extraordinary and worth
 
i
nfinitely more than the relatively few minutes of time that most tourists will
 
a
llow i
t.
 
Please tell me if you plan to come to Washington again.  I should so much appreciate
 
a chance to return your marvellous hospitality, and besides, there are so many
 
worthwhile i
ssues we can discuss -
-
 and throw to the winds if we have to!
 
With regards and affection,
