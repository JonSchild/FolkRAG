Sing oh, for a 
brave and gallant bark, 
And a 
brisk and lively breeze; 
A 
little crew and a 
captain too, 
To carry Inc over the seas ; 
To carry me over the seas, my boys, 
To my true love so gay, 
She has taken a 
trip on a 
government ship, 
Ten thousand miles away.

oh, a 
roving I 
will go, 
I'll stay no more on Manhattan shore, 
So ict the music play ; 
T. 
tart by the morning train, to cross the raging main, 
For I'm on the move to my own true love, 
T-Nu thousand miles away. 
My true love she is beautiful, 
My true love she is young; 
Her eyes are blue as the violet's hue 
And silvery sounds her tongue; 
And silvery sounds her tongue, my boys, 
But while I 
sing this lay. 
She is doing the grand in the distant land, 
ev 
Ten thousand miles away. [ So blow,

Oh ! that was a 
dark and dismal day, 
When last she left the strand, 
She bid good bye with a 
tearful eye, 
And waved her lilly hand; 
She waved her lilly hand, my boys, 
As the big ship left the bay, 
And says she, remember me, 
Ten thousand miles awaT. [So blow, etc. 
Oh ! if I 
could but be a 
bos'n bold, 
Or only a 
born-ba-dier: 
I'd hire a 
boat, and hurry afloat, 
And straight to my true love steer. 
And straight to my true love steer, my boys, 
Where the dancing dolphins play, 
And the whales and the sharks are having their larks, 
Ten thousand miles away. [ So blow, etc. 
Oh ! the sun may shine thro' a 
Winter fog, 
The Hudson run clear and bright; 
The ocean's brine be turned to wine, 
And may I 
forget my Leer. 
And may I 
forget my beer, my boys, 
And the landlord's quarter day, 
But I'll never part from my own sweetheart, 
Ten thousand miles away. [So blow, etc

H OLD YOUR OWN. 
Written and Sung by iONY PASTOR. 
If the world it goes against you, 
And you're struggling for a 
bone, 
Why, tiled's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
If a 
lassie gets her back up, 
Stares at you like a 
stone, 
Why. then's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
If your whey should grow snappish, 
And rise a 
hateful tone, 
Why then's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
If, when robbed of a 
true friendship, 
By slander overthrown, 
Why, then's the time, my laddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
If when you have a 
glass too much, 
Your path has slippery grown, 
Why, then's the time, my kiddie buck, 
To grip and hold your own. 
And when you're tossed by wayward luck, 
By each ill- wind that's blown, 
Why, then's the time, my laddie buck. 
To grip and hold your own. 
In all your acts strike like a 
man, 
Let faltering ne'er be known, 
have a 
mind for yourself always 
And grip and hold your own. 
Ana thus through life, where'er you be 
By circumstances thrown, 
Why, just take hold, my laddie buck, 
And bravely hold your own.

OR ANY OTHER GAL. 
Kind folks I 
loved a 
maiden once, 
Her name was Sally Bell, 
how she serv'd this individual, 
Listen, and I 
will tell. 
Oh! she really was a 
beauty, 
Oh, such a 
charming girl, 
A reglar blue-eyed Venus, 
Was my once Ilv'd faithless SaL. 
She had such a 
lovely figure, 
And such a 
graceful walk, , 
And her tongue it was like honey, 
Whenever she did talk, 
But now she's gone and left me, 
That fair deceitful Sal, 
And I 
lov'd her, oh, better by far 
Than any other gal. 
As 17e were walking out one day, 
So happy arm in arm, 
" 
Trete comes my cousin Smith," says nho, 
Now don't feel alarm'd. 
Up came a 
heavy swell with such 
A fem ful stock of hair, 
And shook my Sally by the hand, 
And gave a 
wicked leer. 
Says he, 
Dear, how d'ye do," 
I 
know I 
then look'd blue, 
But before s1ie spoke I 
said, " Sir," 
What's that to do with you, 
Says I, " this is my Sal. 
And stick to her I 
shall, 
Go and find another cousin, Sir-
Or any other gal." 
[11 
MIA 
OR ANY OTHER GAL.--[CONCLUDED. 
You may guess my astonishment, 
When Sal let go my arm, 
And took hold of her cousin's, 
Which I 
thought was rather warm. 
Says I, `• Sal what d'yo mean by this I" 
Says she, " don't be a 
fool," 
" 
It's all right," said her cousin ; 
" 
My dear Sir, take it cool." 
To strike him I 
felt inclined, 
But he was so jolly tall, 
And I 
felt at that moment, 
So particularly small. 
"This is an old acquaintance 
Of mine," says faithless Sal, 
"For you really are too soft for me, 
Or any other gal." 
My ears I 
could scarce believe, 
'Twas such a 
fearful shock, 
At such a 
piece of impudence, 
My brain was burning hot. 
Off arm in arm they walked, 
And when lost to my view, 
I 
thought for a 
few moments, 
What course I 
should pursue. 
I 
thought I'd take a 
dram, 
My misery to drown, 
But the spirits would not keep me up, 
For I 
kept tumbling down. 
I 
passed. that ni4lit in a 
police cell, 
Forget it I 
never shall, 
And I'll never love another soul, 
Or any other gal.

THE SONG OF THE LOWER CLASSES 
We plough and sow, we're so very, very low, 
That we delve in the dirty clay, 
'Till we bless the plain with the golden grain, 
And the vale with the fragrant hay. 
Our place we know— we're so very, very low— 
'Tis down at the landlord's feet, 
We're not too low the grain to grow, 
Bat too low the bread to eat. 
Down, down we go— we're so very, very low— 
To the hell of the deep-sunk mines; 
But we gather the proudest gems that glow 
When the brow of a 
despot shines; 
And whene'er he lacks upon our backS 
Fresh loads he deigns to lay, 
-We're tar too low to vote the tax, 
But not too low to pay. 
We're low, we're low—mere rabble, we know— 
But at our plastic power, 
The world at the lord hug's feet will grow 
Into palace, and church, and tower. 
Then prostrate fall in the rich man's hall, 
And cringe at the rich man's door, 
We're not too low to build the ‘vall, 
But too low to tread the floor. 
We're low, we're low— we're very, very low— 
Yet from our fingers glide 
The silken flow and the robes that glow 
Round the limbs of the sons of pride. 
And what we get and what we give 
We know, and we know our share, 
We're not too low the cloth to weave, 
But too low the cloth to wear. 
We're low, we're low— we're very, very low— 
And yet when the trumpets ring, 
The thrust of a 
poor man's arm will go 
Through the heart of the proudest king. 
We're low, we're low— our place we ktlow, 
We're only the rank and file. 
We're not too low to kill the fee, 
But too low to touch the spoil.

Near a

Where the rippling streamlets flow,

Oft I 
kissed her and caressed her, 
As we danced the hours away, 
Oft I 
told her that I 
loved her. 
But she's dead, my Sadie Ray. 
When at eve the golden sunset, 
Ushered in the moon and stars, 
Arm-in-arm we walked together, 
To the gate of chestnut bars. 
Here we talked of future pleasures, 
here I 
named our wedding day, 
But alas, ' tis long in coming, 
For she's dead, my Sadie Ray. 
Oft I 
kissed her, 65c.. 
In my dreams I 
see her smiling, 
Far above the clear blue sky, 
She is kneeling to the angels, 
Who in groups are standing by. 
Then again, I 
hear her calling, 
" 
Come, my darling, come I 
say, 
There is room here for another, 
Come and kiss your Sadie." 
Oft I 
kissed her, ezc.

THE ONE HORSE SHAY. 
Mistress Bubb was gay and free, 
Fair, and fat, and forty-three, 
And blooming as a 
peoney in buxom May; 
The toast she long had been 
Of Farringclon Within, 
And she fill d 
the better half of a 
One Horse Shay. 
Mistress Bubb said to her lord, 
" 
We can very well afford, 
What 
e'er a 
common council-man in prudence may; 
" 
We've no brats to plague our lives, 
And the soap concarn it thrives, 
So well take a 
trip to Brighton in the One Horse Shay." 
When at Brighton they were hous'd, 
How they revell'd and carous'd, 
Mr Bubb to his spouse he next did say, 
" 
I've ascertain'd, my dear, 
The mode of dipping here, 
From the ostler what is rubbing up the One Hcrse Shay. 
Old Nobbs I 
am sartin' 
May be trusted gig or cart in, 
And shillings for machines we shan't have to pay, 
He'll stand like a 
post 
While we paddle on the coast, 
And return to dress in our One Horse Shay." 
So out they drove all drest, 
So gaily in their best; 
And finding in their rambles a 
snug little bay, 
They uneased at their leisure, 
And paddled at their pleasure, 
And left everything behind in their One Horse Shay. 
[11 
• 
THE ONE HORSE SHAY.--LCortcLumw. 
But while so snugly sure 
That all things were secure, 
They flounced about like porpoises or whales at play; 
Some young unlucky imps, 
Who prowl'd about for shrimps, 
Stole all their little articles, out of the One Horse Shay. 
When our pair was sous'd enough, 
And returning " in the buff," 
Oh there was the vengeance, and old Nick to pay; 
Madam shrieled in consternation I 
Mr. Bubb he swore damnation! 
To find the empty state of the One Horse Shay. 
" 
Come bundle in with me, 
We must squeeze, for °nee," said he, 
" 
And manage this here business the best we may ;" 
So like two dismal dummies, 
Beads and hands stuck cut like mummies, 
They crept behind the apron of the One Horse Shay. 
Mr. Bubb gee-up'd in vain, 
And strove to jerk the rein; 
Nobbs found he had 1 
is option to work or play, 
So he wouldn't mend his pace, 
Tho' they'd fain have run a 
race, 
To escape the merry gazers at the One Horse Shay. 
Now good people laugh your fill, 
And fancy if you will. 
For I'm fairly out of breath, and have had my say; 
The trouble and the rout, 
To wrap and get then out, 
When they drove up to their lodgings in the One Horse Shay.

then been de-ceived, Is 
e - nongh to make a cove wild, ye know. 
Tier name was Selina Belinda Crow, 
And I 
thought her so tender and mild; 
I 
called on her every day ye know, 
And followed her just like a 
child; 
( 
1 ) 
IT MAKES ME SO AWFULLY.—[CONCLUDED.] 
I 
poured out my heart to Belinda Crow, 
Said for her to the end of the world I'd go; 
But she giggled at me and my love, ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild.— Cho. 
I 
bought her a 
beautiful duck one day, 
And a 
basket with eatables piled; 
She said, Tommy, come in the evening, pray, 
And potatoes we'll have with it biled. 
I'll be out all the day, said Selina Crow, 
Come at ten o'clock, then I'll be in, you know. 
That's the night I 
received such a 
terrible blow, 
And it made me so awfully wild.— Cho. 
New trowsers I 
wore that cost fourteen and six, 
Had my hair cut and beautifully iled; 
In the evening I 
called at her house about six, 
As the time I 
thought might be beguiled; 
I 
looked in at the winder, and didn't I 
stare, 
Miss Crow and a 
dapper young man were there; 
They were eating away at my duck, I 
declare. 
Ohl it made me so awfully wild.— Cho. 
I 
rushed on the pair like a 
lion, ye know, 
And I'm sure I 
looked awfully wild; 
Crying, oh! you deceitful, you false young Crow, 
But she turned up her nose, and she smiled; 
Then the young man arose and to me he did say, 
With his mouth full of duck for which I 
did pay, 
That young lady's my wife, we were married to-day: 
Oh, it made so awfully wild.—Cho. 
Said I, You're a 
swindler and cheat, Miss Crow, 
Said her husband, I 
say, draw it mild; 
Then be kicked me right into the street, ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild 
I 
certainly thought they were very unkind, 
And I 
think that they might have enquired if I'd dined; 
I 
get mad even now when it crosses my mind, 
And it makes me so awfully wild.— Cho.

SIGHTS THAT WE SEE. 
As Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
Think of Your Head." 
New subjects for songs are, of course, all the rage, 
New songs I 
must nightly be singing, 
And of course you'll all say, while Fin here on the stage, 
A new one Pm frequently bringing. 
I've got one to- night, which I 
now sing to you, 
Which I 
trust you will find entertaining; 
It is of the sights in the city we see, 
And I 
hope your applause will be gaining. 
Spoken.—The other morning I 
awaked from my peaceful 
slumbers, rose from my virtuous couch, and descended 
from my magnificent apartment, in the garret of my seven-
story boarding house. 
At the foot of the stairs I 
met my 
landlady's daughter, Seraphina Celestina McCarty. 
She 
gently intimated that I 
was late for breakfast, by saluting 
m.e in this manner : 
AIR :—" Meet me, Josie, at the Gate." 
You have come down at last, but allow me to state 
That the boarders all have long gone away, 
And the hash it is played out, 'cause for breakfast your are 
late. 
And this is my mother's washing day, 
Buckwheat cakes all gone too, 
There is nothing left for you. 
You know that the hour is growing late, 
So you needn't loiter here. 
Let me whisper in your ear, 
I'm to meet my darling peeler t.t the gate. 
Spoken.—A nice idea, no breakfast. 
However, I 
put on 
my hat, and started with all the dignity I 
could muster. 
As .I 
Nvent into the street the first object I 
beheld was a 
Dutch Italian organ grinder, with his - frow " handling a 
tambourine, 
lie was turning the mill, while she sang; 
Ain : —" 
Martha, the Milkman's Daughter." 
Dat Dietcher vomans, vot you now exeoose, 
Vas vonee so light as a 
fairy. 
Dough now she vas bigger anti fatter as a 
goose, 
Or a 
sweetzer kase by a 
dairy. 
Dough she valks up un down by de middle of the road, 
3.1it no lager bier for to please her. 
But she likes dat kimmel un dat pretzel prod,

Und I 
told you her name vos Lisa, 
tind she vonce VOS so happy like a 
cockadoodle robin, 
Or de bullfrog a-sunning- in de vater. 
But she's now played out, like. a 
peek of sour krout, 
Vos Lisa, de Dutchman's daughter. 
Spoken.— I 
gave her my last fifty- cent stamp. 
It was a 
counterfeit. so I 
generously asked no change. 
I walked 
up the street, and the first person that struck my view 
was a 
car conductor, on a 
strike, 
lie gave vent to his 
feelings thusly : 
AIR :—" Pulling Hard Against the Stream." 
Here you see a 
car conductor. 
Toiling fourteen hours a 
day, 
Never once, as all acknowledge. 
" 
Knocking down " to make it pay. 
Capital makes \vat. On labor, 
Heart as hard as any Turk, 
Why refuse a 
fair day's wages 
For an honest, lair day's work ? 
So let the workers help each other, 
Sam and Sandy. Hans and Mike, 
And we'll never see another 
Car conductor's strike. 
Spoken.—A 
little further on I 
tripping it to her work, saying : 
AIR :—" Crossing O'er the Ferry." 
Oh, every day as I 
go to 
The shop ill Fulton street, 
Oh. such a 
charming-. 
handsome man 
I 
happen for to meet ; 
He wears black clothes, a 
jet moustache, 
his name, he says, is Harry, 
He looks so gay. I 
know sonic day 
he'll ask me for to marry. 
Oh, he is so handsome ; cash he's got a 
pile, 
Always looks so dashing, dresses in style. 
No one else I 
fancy, but my darling I 
tarry, 
I 
wish he'd hurry up the cakes, and ask me for to marry. 
Spoken.—I 
left her cogitating on her harry. Next I 
met

a

He was " afther tiltin a bit of a

Ora, Pm a 
Castillian from Cork. 
But Fin going to change my condition, oh ; 
Fm going to get in wid de boys, 
And become a 
nate ward politician, oh, 
As a 
candidate, then, I 
will run, 
And in Congrees my life I'll begin again, 
Or as mayor or althorman, then, 
I'll have office for all of the Finegans. 
Whack fal, & e. 
Fpoken.—Leaving the aspirant for political honors. 
I 
came upon a 
group of boys— that useful and interesting 
class called bootblacks. 
Young America, one of them 
was amusing the rest with a 
song, of which I 
only heard 
one verse—thus ; 
Ant.—" Tickled Them in the Right Place." 
Although Fin a 
bootblack I 
never repine, 
But always content with my lot, 
Just put up your boots and Fll give 'ern a 
shine, 
A shine that you'll say is " red hot." 
The brokers front Wall street I 
often pass by, 
And I 
looks them right up in the face, 
For I 
know that gold panics can ne'er trouble me, 
And they often get in a 
tight place. 
Spoken.—Aint dat so, Jimmy ? Look at de other day, 
dere was gold way tip to 63 in the shade, and bymeby it 
came down to 32 1-2 Mulberry street. 
I'm glad I 
ain't no 
Wall street bull or bear. 
A IR :-" Who's for the Park." 
But now my walk was en led, 
And I 
turned into the store, 
Of sights we see upon the street, 
Just then I 
heard no more. 
But as a 
subject for my song, 
At once I 
noted down, 
The sights we any day may see, 
While walking through the town. 
And it's higho sights that we see, 
As we're walking through the city, 
Higho sights that we see, 
Going through the town.

LITTLE SWEETHEART, COME AND KISS ME. 
Words by ARTHUR W . 
FRENCH. 
Music by W. II. BROCKWAY• 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS, 
The Music of this Song is published by -Mum & GOULLAM), 86 Tre-
mont Street, Boston. 
Price 35 cents. 
Little sweetheart, conic and kiss me, 
Just once more before I 
go , 
Tell inc truly, will you miss me, 
As I 
wonder to and fro ? 
Let me feel the tender pressing 
Of your ruby lips to mine, 
With your dim") e 
hands caressing. 
And your snowy arms entwine. 
Ali, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Come and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro. 
Little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
We may never meet again ! 
We may never roam together 
Down the dear old shady lane ! 
Future years may bring us sorrow, 
That our hearts but little know, 
Still of care we should not borrow; 
Come and kiss me ere I 
go. 
Ali, little sweetheart, come and kiss me, 
Conic and whisper sweet and low ! 
That your heart will sadly miss me, 
As I 
wander to and fro. 
'Tis years long since in Cambding Town 
Lived a 
rich man called Brewer, 
He brewed Ale and Stout with great renown, 
And made tie m always power ; 
For anywhere you'd see his name, 
First for Stout, Ale and Porter, 
And he was bleed with an only child, 
Confiding loving (
laughter. 
C1101 .I.CS. 
To disregard the paternal admonistion, 
I 
wretched mortal thought her, 
Each day do I 
ben- ale the fate 
Of BreWer'S lovely daughter. 
'Twas I 
who used to he his clerk, 
To look after cash, Ale and Porter; 
With contrite heart I 
now confess 
I 
looked after none but the daughter. 
I 
can't divulge our goings on 
My modest heart it shocks ; 
To casi noes oft and oft we went, 
We were p:trtial both to hops. 
To disregard her august sire, & c. 
But kissing once the lowly clerk, 
The intagid patient caught her ; 
When he at once then kicked no-, 
out, 
And t. rashed his only daughter. 
Then round the brew-er-i she ran, 
It was in vain they song lit her ; 
The father never more from then 
Cast eyes on his lovely daughter, 
To disregard the antique buffer, & c. 
Full fifteen months had passed away, 
No Ale he'd brewed or Beer, 
He opened then the brewery, 
But his heart it made so queer, 
For at the bottom of a 
large vat lay, 
Amongst refuse of stale Porter, 
A crinoline steel, the busk of a 
stay, 
And toe heels of the boots of his daughter. 
To disregard the parental cure, & c. 
Right in the vat she'd fallen flat, 
And thus she found her Lice, 
The ,premises being so long closed 
Is why they did not see her. 
'Twas strange from when she disappeared 
The fain. rose of the Porter ; 
Ah little did the public know 
It was old Brewer's daughter. 
To disregard the antidilucian pastor, & c.

I SAID I'D FOLLOW HER EVERYWHERE. 
One balmy night in lovely spring to Cremorne I 
did go. 
Reclining ' neath a 
bower with spirits very low, 
A lovely charmer there I 
saw so delicately fair, 
A short neck dress this beauty had, and wavy golden hair, 
hair. 
CHORUS. 
And I 
swore I'd follow her everywhere, everywhere, every-
where, 
She'd ruby red lips, eyes azure blue, this sweet girl with 
the golden hair. 
Then asking might I see her home, I 
gained consent to 
do, 
I 
could have died for the golden hairand the fairy charmer 
too. 
Arriving home she informed me her husband's name was 
Bro wn, 
And asking for him, " Oh," she said, " he's only out of 
town, town." 
In a 
furnished first floor lived at her ease, in the neatest 
house of the row, 
Number 42, in the street in a 
place called Pimlico ; 
No wealth she said, she had in lands, nor jewels rich or 
rare: 
"0 ! fie," said I, " what can you wish for with gold galore 
in your hair, hair ?" 
And I 
swore, &c. 
23 
I SAID, & e.—[CONCLUDED. 
As the night wore on the stars shone out, she was so pre-
cious kind, 
That I 
put my arm just round her waist, she never seemed 
to mind ; 
And then her head dropped gently down on my shoulder 
it nestled there, 
Oh, the angel in hue and a 
cherubim too, was the girl with 
the golden hair. 
And I 
swore, &c. 
I 
fear it is late in a hurry I 
said, I 
rose then to wish her 
good bye, 
Oh, cruel, she said, to leave me thus, pray do not beso shy 
I 
stooped to raise my fallen hat, on the stairs as I 
hurried 
down, 
At the foot I 
was caught on the mat by her darling hus-
band Brown, Brown. 
And I 
swore, etc. 
Oh. dear, I 
saw what a 
fool I'd been, I'd ran in a 
precious 
snare 
Brown justice sought before a court, my innocence 
declare; 
Old judge sat with a knowing frown, at me he much did 
stare, 
The verdict was £ 500 to pay for your freak with the 
golden hair, hair.

swore, &c.

Jane be - gan to 
work on Tho-mas - 's Machine. 
No sooner had I 
bought it than to work she did begin, 
And all day long I 
had to hear that horrid whirring din; 
I 
gently reprimanded her, and told my Mary Jane, 
If I 
heard that noise too often, it would surely turn my brain. 
You must know that I'm an author, and by writing make my bread, 
And to write well you want silence, and a 
cool collected head; 
So as any noise disturbed me, you can understand my spleen, 
When I 
had to write and listen to the whirr of that machine. 
Cho.-Oh, Mr. Thomas, &c. 
At first I 
swore a 
little swear, and then I 
swore a 
big, 
And then I 
jumped about with rage, and almost danced a 
jig; 
But it never had the least effect, she worked away like steam, 
Sometimes she'd do a 
flounce or tucker, then she'd do a 
seam. 
A 
feeling the reverse of love, almost akin to hate, 
At last came o'er me, and I 
said, my love, we'll separate; 
I'll take my books and papers to some spot calm and serene, 
Where I 
cannot be annoyed by Mr. Thomas's Machine. 
Cho.- Oh, Mr. Thomas, itc. 
It's two months since I 
left her, and I 
certainly must say, 
I 
regret the cause exceedingly that made me go away ; 
So mind you all take warning now, by what you've heard and seen, 
And don't be over anxious for a 
Thomas's Machine. 
For if it hadn't been for that, my wife would even now 
Be residing with her husband, and we'd ne'er have had a 
row; 
And I 
never should have purchased it, if this I 
had foreseen, 
So you see that I 
have cause to hate a 
Thomas's Machine.

PORKIE JOE. 
Sung by TONY PASTOR. 
It's about a 
month ago, I 
went to Fairlop fair, 
I 
took Sarah for a 
treat, and we looked a 
nobby pair; 
There was a 
lot of us hired a 
van, I 
should think about a 
score, 
But if we count the kids, there would be a 
dozen more; 
There was Mr. Porkie Joe, who thought I 
was a 
dunce, 
And soon got up his larks, so I 
gave him the tip at once. 
,
(poken—Y 
es, Mr. Flash Joe was too fast from the beginning 
so I 
said to him 
CHORUS. 
You must keep your mawleys off of Sal; I 
don't allow it, 
though a 
pal, 
Hit me, smash me, knock me down, but don't you touch my 
iraL 
We soon were on the road, and everything so gay, 
The horses had their load, and a 
good blow-out of hay, 
We had lots of grub in the van, and I 
enjoyed my pipe, 
After taking a 
swig of the can, and Sarah was eating some tripe, 
But Mister Porkie Joe, he couldn't leave Sal alone, 
So I 
said to him again, in a 
sort of an undertone, 
Spoken— Yes, Mr. Porkie Joe was too fast to begin with, so I 
said to him, Joe, 
You must keep your mawleys, tiTc. 
[11 
27 
PORKIE ,I0E.—[Cosetubm). 
At last we got to t,le fair, and Sarah went in a 
swing, 
And Mister Joe was there, dancing the highland fling, 
Then he bought a 
pea-shooter, a 
whopper, made of tin, 
And every now and then he would drop a 
hot-'un 
We went down a 
shady lane, to take a 
slight repose, 
When Mister Joe he dropped a 
horse-bean on Sarah's nose. 
Spoken—Now, that got my monkey up. 
I 
stood the peas, but 
when Sarah caught the bean on the nose, I 
said, " I 
tell you 
what it is, Mister Joe, I 
shall punch your head, if you don't lave 
Sal alone !" " Why, I 
never touched her," said Joe. " No," 
says I, " but you laid that ere bean on her nose,"—showing 
Sarah's nose, which had swelled up as big as a 
Jersey crab. " So 
you had better take my advice, 
And keep your mawleys, 
At last he said to me, " I 
think just now you said, 
As how, as if as you could go and punch my head," 
And before I'd time to speak, the left Duke he let fly, 
I 
stopped it—with my beak and the corner of my eye; 
Then we quickly formed a 
ring, and went it left and right, 
The police, they collared us both, and locked us up all night. 
Spoken—Yes, we both were locked up and the next morning 
the beak fined us ten bob a-piece. 
Joe said " he was sorry." I 
told him " it would have been better to have taken my advice, as 
I 
said. to him from the first, 
You must keep your mawleys,

NEVER FORSAKE THE SHIP. 
Never forsake. the ship ! 
Her keel drives on through the heavy sea, 
Like a 
ploughshare cleaving the furrowed lea, 
Tossing aimt Uiiglit vreaths of spray, 
Feathery buds of the Ocean's May ! 
Coronals white as the stainless snow 
Shine ir, the NVake, of the vessel's prow ; 
Oh, never were blossoms so pure and fair 
As the vapoury jewels glistening there. 
Never desert the ship! 
The land lies yonder— through cloud and foam— 
Ever steer on for our distant home, 
Though the tightened cordage snap in twain, 
And the creaking timbers shiver and strain; 
Though the sluggish sails may droop and fall, 
Like the heavy folds of a 
funeral pall, 
The breeze \ \
ill awaken, the wind uprise, 
And the brave barque speed under sunny skies. 
Never forsake the ship ! 
Hope may wither and courage fail, 
If faith sustains us, no need to quail ; 
Oh, blinded vision— oh, darkened sight. 
Pine through the gloom of the shrouding night; 
Though the longed- for haven be hid from view, 
Believe that a 
home awaited! you, 
Mariners! pause not to idly deplore 
The rugged path to that promised shore. 
Never give up the ship ! - 
By the sunken rock and the shelving strand, 
Guide her 
on with a 
firm brave hand, 
Sreering away for the ehainless sea, 
Her sails all set and her flag flung free, 
So let us wrestle for freedom or life, 
pl 
NEVER FORSAKE, &C.—[CoNcLuDED. 
Where the hurricane wages a 
generous strife; 
No hidden reef, like a 
treacherous foe, 
Lying in ambush to strike a 
blow. 
Never desert the ship 
Even though perils be brooding near, 
Turn not aside Nvith the recreant's fear; 
No one can tell when the heavens may lower, 
And the fierce storm burst out in its terrible power, 
And the lash of the sea, like a 
slave-driver's whip, 
Fall with its wrath ou the beautiful ship ; 
Set her to rights, men, and keep her afloat, 
Nor slink in your dread to the life-saving boat. 
Never forsake the ship! 
The masts may be shattered, the white sails be rent, 
And the tapering spars, like a 
reed, may be bent; 
Yet elingto the barque though her timbers may yawn, 
And the rudder you steered by be parted and gone, 
The fast holding anchor be wrenched from the chain, 
Amid her beam, from the stem to the stern, riveu in 
twain ; 
Flinch not, doomed comrades ! but terror dispel, 
Though her strong oaken ribs be crushed in like a 
shell. 
Never desert the ship ! 
Heed not the crash that has sundered the deck, 
Remember your oaths, men and stand by the wreck; 
The keel's lying upmost. the mainmast below, 
And the sea- weed's dark tangles are wreathed round 
the prow. 
Gird up your souls, there is glory in death, 
Who would not strive for the martyr's pale wreath ? 
With brow still undaunted and firmly set lip, 
Let a wild cheer ring out, a . d 
go down with the 
ship.

LOVELY NAN. 
Words and Music by C. Maw'. 
Sweet is the ship, that's under sail, 
Spreads her white bosom to the gale, 
Sweet, Oh sweet, the flowing can, 
Sweet to poise the labourin g 
oar, 
That tugs us to Our native shore. 
When the boatswain pipes the barge to man, 
Sweet sailing with a 
fav'ring breeze; 
But, Oh, much sweeter than all these, 
Is Jacks delight— his lovely Nan I 
The needle, faithful to the north, 
To show of constancy the worth, 
A curious lesson teaches man ; 
The needle time may rust, the squall 
Capsize the binnacle anti all, 
Let seamanhip do all it can; 
My love its worth shall higher rise, 
Nor time shall rust, nor squalls capsize, 
My faith and truth to lovely Nan. 
When in the bilboes I 
was penn'd 
For serving of a 
worthless friend, 
And every creature from me ran ; 
No ship performing quarantine 
Was ever so deserted seen— 
None haird me, women, child or man ; 
But thought false friendship's sails were furl'd, 
Though cut adrift by all the world, 
all the world in lovely Nan. 
I 
love my duty, love my friend, 
Love truth and country to defend, 
To mourn their loss who hazard ran ; 
I 
love to take an honest part, 
Love beauty 
a 
spotless heart, 
By manners love tO show the rum n ; 
To sail through life by honour's breeze— 
'Twas all along of loving these 
First made me dote on lovely Nan.

THE BRIGHTON DOCTOR. 
In Brighton once there liv'd a 
man, 
As I 
have heard folks say ; 
And if he doesn't live there still, 
lie must have gone away. 
And he's four feet upon a 
pinch, 
Though scarcely quite so tall; 
And if he hasn't grown an inch, 
must be very small. 
spoken —Yes, there isn't no doubt of that; and though he 
was a 
wery small man, yet he wore a 
wer,' large vig ; and as he 
walked along with his large . ig, and a 
little stick in his hand, 
you would have thought he was a— what you may call a— sort 
of a 
Rum ti turn turn fol ol ol, (tc. 
This little man of mighty fame, 
A doctor was, ' tis true; 
But as I 
never knew his name, 
1 
uannot tell it you. 
The patients came, both far and near, 
To try the doctor's skill; 
And those he didn't know how to cure, 
lie well knew how to kill. 
Spoken.—Yes. and by this means he got a 
wery larg,e number 
of patients ; they came to him in a 
flock, just like so man2,- sheep. 
and hevery one on them vas more worser nor the other; 'out if 
they vas sheep, the doctor he knew wery well how to fleece them. 
When any of them came to him he would look wery grave ; then 
the patient would say, " 01 dear doctor, I'm so 
wery 
hilt ; 
pray, doctor, what do you think is the matter with me 2" 
Why—hum—ha—I 
think you've got a 
sort of a—kind of a—

This little man fell deep in love, 
"With a 
lady tall and ; 
And she, sweet turtle cooing dove, 
Fell deep in love with him.

THE BRIGHTON DOCTOR.--lCoNcLunzo. 
And soon to church he led his bride, 
To make her bone of bone; 
She look -d 
a 
May-pole by the side 
Of him, a 
little mile stone. 
Fp`oken, — They were a

at her, this vay, vhy you thought you vould never come to the

thought you'd never come down so far, for you see she was about 
the height of— (holdiny up his hand as high as possible)—and he 
was about the height—( holding 
it low)—a—just about— 
Rum ti turn, 
But soon the doctor, to his cost, 
Found out he'd got no prize ; 
For she both tongue and nails had got, 
To tease both ears and eyes. 
She caught a 
cold and strange to tell, 
She bit her nails with pain ; 
But the doctor physic'd her so well, 
She ne'er got ill again. 
.qpoken..—No, she never did gct hill no more, 'cause vhv ? the 
last do e he gave her, made a

When done he feasted all his kin, 
In honor of her death; 
But drank so much of Hodges' gin, 
It fairly stopt his breath. 
So then they popLid the doctor too, 
in coffin with his wife ; 
And what is strange, though very true, 
They ne'er came again to life. 
Spoken.—They had a 
very large funeral tho'—aye, and when 
they were buried, their friends herected a

them, and it had a

TILI TURPIN. 
Tim Turpin he was gravel blind. 
And ne.er had seen the skies, 
For nature when his head was made, 
Forgot to dot his eyes. 
So like a 
Christian pedagogue, 
Poor Tim was frweed to do. 
Look out for pupils. for he had 
A 
vacancy for two. 
There's some have specs to help their sight, 
Of objects dim and small ; 
But Thin had .
specs within his eyes. 
Yet could not see at all ; 
NOW Tilll he woo'd a 
servant maid, 
And took her to his arms, 
For he, like Pyrallln, had east 
A wall-eye on her charms. 
By day she led him up and down, 
Where'er she wish'd to jog ; 
A happy wife, although she led 
The life of any dog. 
But just when Tim had lived a 
month 
in honey with his wife, 
A surgeon op'd his Miltro, eyes 
Like oysters, with a 
knife. 
But when his eyes were open'd. thus, 
lie wislikl them dark again; 
For when he looked upon his wife, 
lie saw her very plain ; 
Her face was bad, her figure worse, 
lie couldn't bear to eat ; 
For she was anything but like 
A grace before his meat. 
Now Tim he was a 
feeling man, 
For when his sight was thick, 
lie used to feel for every thing— 
And that was with a 
stick; 
So with the cudgel in his hand, 
That was not light or slim— 
He knock'd at his wife's head until 
It open'd unto him." 
And when the corpse was stiff and cold, 
lie took his slaughtered spouse, 
And laid her in a 
heap with all 
The ashes of her house.

TIM TURPIN. —[CoNcLuDED. 
But like a 
wicked murderer, 
He liv'd in constant fear, 
From day to day, and so he cut 
His throat from ear to ear. 
The neighbors feteied a 
doctor in— 
Sys he, " This wound, I 
dread, 
Caui Inirdly be sewed up— his life 
Is hanging on a 
thread." 
But when another week was gone, 
He gave him stronger hope— 
Instead of hanging on a 
thread 
Of hanging by a 
rope. 
Ah ! when he hid his murderous work, 
In ashes round about, 
How little he suppos'd the truth 
Would soon be sifted out ; 
For when the parish dustman catne 
his rubbish to \vithdraw,— 
He found more dust within that bin, 
Than he contracted for. 
A dozen men to try the fact 
Were sworn the very day; 
And though they all vere jurors, yet 
No conjurors were they. 
Said. Tim unto the jurymen, 
" 
You need not waste your breath, 
For I 
confess myself at once, 
The author of her death. 
And oh ! when I 
reflect upon 
The blood that I 
have spilt ; 
Just like a 
button is my soul. 
Inscribed with double gilt ;" 
Then turning rotund his head again, 
He saw before his eyes. 
A great judgre and it little judge,— 
The judges of assize. 
The great judge took his judgment cap, 
And put it on his head, 
And sentenced Tim by law, to hang, 
Till he was three times dead ; 
So he was tried, and he was hung, 
(Fit punishment for such) 
On Horsham drop, can any say 
Tim had a 
drop too much.

THAT EXCELLENT JUDGE. 
Written and sung by TONY PASTOR. 
"Which I 
wish to remark 
And my langnage is plain, 
For ways that are dark, 
And tricks that are vain," 
The heathen Chinee aint peculiar, 
Anymore than anybody else. 
The excellent judge 
In Brooklyn abides, 
And don't say, oh fudge! 
Till you learn what betides 
The " child-like and innocent victim," 
Whom this excellent judge over-rides. 
A 
citizen mild, 
So I 
have been told, 
As meek as a 
child, 
Or a 
lamb in the fold, 
Was mashed by a 
terrible buffer, 
In a 
manner familiar of old. 
He lodged a 
complaint 
As feeling quite grieved, 
But truly, twas quaint 
How he was received 
By the smiling and excellent judge, 
Who devil a 
bit in " mashing" believed. 
The facts were all plain, 
The judge looked severe, 
Evidence, like rain, 
Made everything clear, 
But whatever induced the queer verdict 
Was never fully made to appear, 
(1) 
The plaintiff was " mashed," 
Oh, yes, without cause, 
The defendant, unabashed, 
Had broken the laws, 
But the plaintiff " hada't ought to complain," 
In fact, he ought to  ' know how things was." 
" 
Defendant " said judge, 
" 
I'm really ashamed; 
From here HI not budge 
Til: something is named 
To satisfy this good citizen 
Whom, just in playfulness, you have " mashed." 
Plaintiff wants justice, 
Defendant wants law, 
Now, rally, must his 
Be pressed up to law 
"Why don't you settle it over a 
drink ? 
What's the use of having any more jaw 2" 
The verdict rendered, 
Was open, you see, 
And yet it surrendered 
To the poor Chinee 
The palm by all enlightened Christians 
In trickery' the great monopoly. 
Though justice is blind, 
Its's plain unto me, 
There is something behind. 
What'er it may be. 
The fa'r goddess, in face, may be sightless, 
But the justice, my friend, you can see 
THE BROKEN -HEARTED BELLE. 
SUNLIGHT OF MY SOUL.

Where dogs and rats, and mice and cats, 
Are all 1;ept in one cage.

For she's married, dx.

And fat as she was fair ! 
And never did I

Would be married, & e.

The kitchen fire was blazing bright,

TIIE HAPPY FAMILY.—{CoNcLuoaD 
Upon the wedding morning,

And choked the chimpanzee. 
And she's married, & c.

Or if they did they would not pay,

That she ha I

To the happy familee.

I'm forsaken for another, one with gold in store ; 
Then farewell father and mother, I 
m 
despised for being poor. 
We have lived and loved from childhood, and vowed we ne'er 
would part. 
Passed many hours in the wild wood but she has nearly broke 
my heart, 
There came a 
wealthy stranger, just from a 
foreign shore, 
He woo'd, and soon he gained her from me for I 
was poor. 
When wed the bells were chiming, as the carriage it pass'd by, 
The lads and ! asses smiling but a 
tear bedimn'd her eye, 
Farewell vain girl, the ocean will part us evermore 
I 
lov'd you with devot.on, but was scorned for being poor. 
I 
shall never more behold- her, nor hear her sweet voice again, 
I've enlisted for a 
soldier, to die on the battle plain; 
May sorrow ne•er distress her, but Iappiness in store, 
And yet loving I 
will bless her, though despised for being poor. 
Sang by TONY PASTOR. 
Oh, Pm a 
sample of a 
used- up man, 
Afflicted with a 
thousand ills, 
I•ean't get fat, do what I 
can. 
Just look as these half-starved gills, 
Ary parents were as thin as I, 
They never had a 
shadow— so people say, 
They W C11% off like a.ptiff, they couldiot die, 
And their boy is wasting away. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, it's a 
pity that I'm so thin, 
I'm sure that I 
shall never get fat, 
I 
look like a 
small-sized clothes pin, 
To find me you must get a 
map. 
The doctor recommended me, 
To drink nothing else but so-long tea. 
But I. busted a 
brewery not tar from here, 
Where they sold (Andaman beer ; 
011, I 
worry and cry, and sob nal fret, 
To see my ft lends grow stout and gay, 
Fat on me 
never get, 
For, oh, I'm wasting away. 
Oh, it's a 
pity, & c, 
All the gals they do me shun, 
And shake me for some other fell, 
They say I 
look like the barrel of a 
gun, 
Could be used for an waken : 
Oh, what will 1 
do ? Oh, where VIII I 
go ? 
In the eye of an needle I 
make my stay, 
I'll never came out, till I 
get stout. 
For, oh, I'm wasting away. 
Oh, it's a 
pity, &c,

THE

TICKET ON THE SHAWL.—[CONCLUDED.] 
I 
bought the shawl without delay, 
Most girls, you know, like some display; 
That garment I 
so wished to don, 
So in the shop I 
put it on; 
Of course, I 
felt it no surprise 
To notice every body's eyes 
Attracted by my purchase, no, 
I 
felt quite sure it would be so. 
Oh dear, &e. 
My ears were startled, I 
declare, 
When I 
heard a 
lad cry out, " Look there ' 
Why, I 
say, Bill, ion' bless my eyes, 
Don't she know how to advertise ?" 
Then Bill replied, " Well, I 
must say, 
The lady does look rather gay, 
She really is a 
charmer, Ben, 
And precious cheap at two pounds ten." Oh dear, & a. 
I 
walked as far as Temple Bar, 
When a 
girl said, " Oh, miss, there you are; 
I 
must confess you do look nice, 
But you shouldn't tiket up the price." 
A cabman cried out, " Miss, good luck, 
I 
likes a 
girl wot's got good pluck, 
I'll buy you for a 
wife, miss, when 
I 
saves as much as two pounds ten." 
Oh, dear, dze_ 
I 
felt a 
kind of strange alarm, 
But a 
gent politely touched my arm, 
Saying, " Let me your attention call 
To this ticket pinned upon your shawl." 
I 
nearly fell, but he caught my arm, 
And his soothing words had such a 
charm; 
We married, and I 
bless the hour when 
He met me marked up "two pounds ten." 
And now I 
am a 
happy wife, 
Surrounded by the joys of life, 
I 
often tell of where and when 
He saw me marked up " two pounds ten."

THE NEW WHACK ROWDEDCYW. 
Arrang..,d 
as a 
Banjo Solo by ToNy PAsToa. 
Now, there are many questions that agitate the mind. 
But the question of them all, I 
guess, is woman's rights, 
you'll find : 
These pretty dears, it now appears, are on a 
big high doo-

And they wound up— stop, oh, -,

Mrs. Blood ? 
Golly, what a 
Congressman ! but what other 
could you expect, when they are going around w 
ith their 
bloody Woman's Rights by P. and downses? Talk about 
Blue Beard and his forty-ieven wives! 
lie ain't nowhere 
against these women Nvho ain't satiAied with gobbling' up 
all the men, but want to smother all their families. or else 
send them to the public nurseries. 
I 
tell you. lads. it will 
be a 
hard old time tor the coming generations, when their 
mammas get mixed in polities, and come home election 
days With a 
swelled head, and when they go to Congress, 
if these women don't get something worse than a 
swelled 
head among them Congress fellows with the whack row-
dedows, they'll be lucky, you bet. 
Now, women claim affection, the blessed little dears, 
And don't they make the men come down with their little 
smiles and tears, 
That's how the elves just wind themselves around our best 
affect ions. 
But what will come if we take home the Woman's Rights 
connections? 
CnOlzus.—With their whack rowdedows, 
Oh, lordy, won't they hatch 'em, 
With the whack rowdedow, 
'low are you, Mrs. Freelove ? 
Spoken.—I 
tell 
you, gentlemen. when a woman is a 
woman all over, she just lays lik•avy damages on the male 
portion of the community ; but jcst let those women once 
become men, all except the handles and I 
tell you it won't 
be no further use to ask, Does your mother know you're 
out ? A woman has got to be a 
woman, if she wants to

Just think of one

Who's going to

That's what I 
want to know. There might 
be a 
big cry-out against it and little cry, too, when Mrs. 
Congressman felt better ; but who'll pay the bills for these 
little whackdedows? 
There's where the lemon wants 
spicing.

THE RAILWAY BELLE. 
I

In the pickling vinegar trade, 
And never had cause for a 
moment's woe, 
Till meeting a 
fair young maid. 
Who served behind a 
first-class bar, 
On the Chatham and Dover line, 
Refreshment room, I 
ought to say, 
But that mistake is mine. 
CHORUS.

My case is very hard, 
She left me as silly as a 
farm-yard goose, 
When she married that Railway Guard. 
Her eyes were blue as the bounding sea, 
Her hair was the colour of gold, 
As blythe as a 
lark, and busy as a 
bee, 
While the twopenny buns she sold; 
Or served the soup so very hot, 
As the bell rang for the train, 
To scald your mouth, or leave the lot, 
But then you couldn't complain. 
I 
try to be merry, tic. 
Lovers she had of every sort, 
From the dustman to the swell, 
YOU may suppose she'd lots of beaux, 
This charming Railway Belle. 
But she served them with the same good will, 
Favourites she had none, 
'Twas" Thank you, sii;," as she filled the till, 
And a 
smile for evdyone.

With favour she looked down on me. 
With joy my heart was cheered,

A rival he appeared. 
All clothed in green, with silver lace 
On the collar of his coat a

At least I'm far from slim, 
I'm five feet six, he's six. feet five, 
All polished neat and trim. 
I 
try to be merry, tic. 
I 
mustered courage to propose, 
And asked her to be mine; 
But she turned up her little nost, 
And said she must decline, 
She was engaged, or perhaps she might, 
Look on me with regard. 
In less than three short months from that, 
She married the Railway Guard. 
I 
try to be merry, &c. 
I 
never travel now by train, 
Since I 
got in that line, 
For memory will almost break 
This tender heart of mine. 
The sight of a 
railway makes me ill, 
The sight of green coats, sad. 
I'm never out at ball or rout, 
For the Guard Waltz drives me mad.

THIS BLOOMING ROSE. 
This blooming rose, at early dawn, 
Expanding to the view, 
I 
plucked the flower, though sharp its thorn, 
Because it looked like you; 
But gazing on thy beauteous face, 
Its likeness fades to view, 
For on the rose thy blush I 
trace— 
Its charms must yield to you, 
THE GIPSEY'S TENT. 
Far over hill and plain, freely we roam, 
Where -
tidture's beauties reign, we make our home: 
Unfurl the gipsey's tent—who shall gainsay, 
None dare our path prevent, roam where we may. 
Still over hill and plain gaily we roam, 
No thought of care or pain reaches our home, 
hark ! the proud eagle's scream—such is our song, 
Free as the mountain's stream, rude rocks among. 
Now by the green hill- side backing WA lie, 
Or by the rippling title care we defy, 
wild as the dashing wave far o'er the sea, 
What though the tempest rave, reckless are we. 
rot to the fealty, still we are true, 
Chaunting our liberty, words and wilds through, 
Who would the shackles wear, home cloth entwine, 
Tribe of the gipsies, neer thfaidem 
tie thine. 
'Twas on a 
Sabbath morn, 
The bells had chim'd for church, 
The yeung and gay were gathering 
Around the rustic porch. 
There came an aged man, 
In a 
soldier's garb was he, 
And gazing on the group, he cried, 
Do none remember me. 
The Veteran forgot 
His friends were changed or gone, 
The manly forms around him there, 
As children he had known. 
He pointed to the spot, 
Where his dwelling used to be, 
Then looking round, and smiling said, 
You now remember me. 
Alas ! none knew him there— 
He pointed to a 
stone, 
On which the name he breath'd was traced, 
A name to them unknown. 
And then the old man wept! 
rm friendless now. cried he, 
Where I 
had many friends in youth, 
Not one remembers me. 
The old m's heart seemed broke ! 
Said he, is this my home ? 
I 
hop'd with friends to end my '_lays 
Alas 
that hope has flown. 
He elasp'd the moss-grown tomb. 
Thou art welcome death, said he 
Forgotten now by all on earth, 
Oh! God remember me. 
SHE'S ONLY SEVENTEEN. 
I'm in love I'd have you know, 
And the feeling's very queer, 
They call her darling little Flo, 
IIer voice I 
love to hear, 
It's sweeter than the blackbird, 
Singing from a 
tree, 
And only her, upon my word, 
I 
love to go and see. 
CHORUS. 
It seems just like a 
dream. 
When first I 
met my queen. 
She's this darkey's honey-comb, 
She's only seventeen. 
Oh the rainbow is pretty in the sky, 
And a 
sun-shower very pretty too, 
Methinks I 
hear you 
reply 
They are very handsome things to view, 
But perhaps to see this girl you would 
Say she's the prettiest of all, 
if by chance you ever should, 
In love with her you'd fall.
