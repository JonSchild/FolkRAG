GREY HORSE BLUES
(Text imcomplete)
Oh, mamma, tell me what in the world is on your mind, Babe, what's on your mind? Evey
time I think, I jest can't keep from cryin'
Hitch up my old grey mare, hitch up my old grey mare, I'm goin' find Corinna, she's in the
world somewhere.
Saddle up my old grey mare, and hitch up my old bugy, too She told me now, she told me
too, She told my sister, she told me too. Now, my boy, where my luck goin' take you.
Needn't look for me on Sunday, cause I'm goin' take Corinna to Sunday school.
