8:42 
How did you get involved in 
this work?  
Family service coordinator at migrant Head 
Start program 8 years. She was a teacher in 
the toddler room. Had to leave for personal 
reasons. Did a lot of coordination with the 
families, the growers and such. That is when 
she met Eileen McManus and Mirna Zapata- 
 
 
When she was out of work, Eileen said she 
had an opening for a project. NY Agricultural 
Center in upstate New York. I got to know the 
growers, farm workers, and community 
members to meet and talk about the needs of 
the farmworkers around health. One was about 
vision and the other was back pain. After those 
projects Eileen offered Marilyn the outreach 
worker job.  
11:27 
What did she like about the 
Head Start Job?  
Working with the kids and the parents and 
helping them to get educated about health and 
such. 
 
 
Marilyn has a bachelor’s degree in education 
from a university in Puerto Rico in 1985 but 
she really wanted to work with little children. 
She never taught in Puerto Rico. 
12:43 
What brought her to the US? 
Lots of siblings in the U.S.. Her family wanted 
her to come and visit. She ended up staying 
and getting married. 
13:20 
Favorite part of being an 
Outreach Worker 
She loves driving and taking people from place 
to place. People say she knows alot but she 
responds that she has a lot to learn 
12:53 
Typical Day 
Changes from day to day. Things can change. 
Last Wednesday - she had only one patient but 
hit a lot of traffic. Arrived 10 minutes late but 
they could still see her patient. She got a call to 
leave the first patient, go back to the site, get 
another patient to urgent care. While she was 
driving back to the site, a nurse called and 
wanted her to do a home visit. The first patient 
needed medication but instead of sending it to 
a pharmacy close to the patient's home, it was 
sent to another town (because it was cheaper). 
She did get to their home visit, but it was late in 
the day.  
 
 
She doesn’t mind when it is a little crazy. She 
loves to travel and you have to get the work 
done.  
17:45 
Where do you drive?  
Middletown, Pine Island, Westchester, 
depending on the needs.  
18:33 
How do you pass the time? 
Talk about family, about sickness, need to see 
a specialist. It is a moment when she can 
educate them about health issues, financial aid 
and more.  
 
 
For example, she is able to tell the patient 
about the doctor they will be seeing. 
Reminding them that she is there to help with 
translation and such. And remind them to ask 
the doctor questions and get clarifications. 
20:48 
Get information from the client 
because you are together for 
so long.  
She can get a lot of information in the car, but 
HIPPA laws keep her from passing that 
information along. It does give her a fuller 
picture of the patient and can use it indirectly.  
 
 
 
Marilyn has great relationships with community 
members, farmworkers, and farmers.  
22:18 
How does she develop a 
relationship over time with, 
say, a patient?  
A patient (or a lot of patients). Most are 
farmworkers. Because of her work at 
Headstart, a lot of families have known her for 
more than 12 years and she still has a 
relationship with them. Most of them reach out 
and help them get appointments, especially 
with specialists.  
 
 
23:53 
Can you tell us about one 
person?  
A single mom with 5 children, (aged 7 to 22), 
Marilyn knows all the children and the mom. 
Each child has their own needs. Younger 
children needed school physicals. Older on 
wanted to go into the army and needed an 
EKG. Passed the information to the recruiter.  
27:03 
Do you serve exclusively with 
migrant farmworker 
populations?  
No, we do uninsured people, unemployed with 
no unemployment. And those who have 
insurance as well.  
27:33 
Where do the patients come 
from 
We are very multicultural: Puerto Rico, Mexico, 
Honduras, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, 
Argentina, Haiti, Russians, Vietnamese, 
Japanese, and Americans. At Goshen site it is 
largely Latino 
28:56 
Do you try to learn about the 
cultures?  
She asks the patients questions about their 
cultures.  
2923 
Greatest accomplishments 
and rewards of the job, what 
about greatest challenges?  
Communication and understanding. She 
speaks very fast with her Spanish. She has to 
think about slowing down. 
30:20 
Do you find that you 
accommodate that they speak 
a slightly different Spanish, or 
use different descriptions?  
It is more when they speak an indigenous 
language. Sometimes she has to the language 
line - it is a phone number you call to get help 
with languages.  
32:10 
Is it available all the time?  
Yes, it is available anywhere we need it.  
 
32:30 
How did you learn to do the 
job?  
She really came with experience from the 
Head Start job. She went to the homes of the 
children during that job as well.  
33:27 
Who did you learn with and 
from?   
OLGA! She is the master. She was a great 
help. So is Rodrigo, he is a great help with the 
computer. Lupe as well. 
34:39 
Have you trained anyone? 
Around 9 people. Trained someone from 
Rockland County, Armenia, and New Paltz. 
There was a group from New Jersey who 
wanted to know how we do our job. They 
followed us for two days. A lot of people use us 
as an example.  
36:14 
Do you all see the same 
patients or different patients?  
We all see different patients. In the old days 
we had a calendar book. Now we use Outlook 
and have a color code. I am purple, Rodrigo is 
orange. Showing what times we are where. 
Everyone is able to see where we are and at 
what time. They always have our cell phone 
number. Almost daily Rodrigo and I touch 
base.  
 
 
Communication is the key. You really have to 
be a good communicator.  
38:40 
How are thing different during 
COVID?  
When COVID started, especially the main 
hospitals, it was loaded with a lot of COVID 
patients and asked us to minimize visits to the 
hospitals to see specialists. We started getting 
a lot of requests for COVID tests.  
 
 
At first the clinic asked who was willing to go 
on unemployment. Marilyn didn’t work from 
April to July. Rodrigo stayed and worked but 
he got COVID during a farm visit. The provider 
was coming in and doing COVID tests and a 
lot of visits. When she came back they started 
slowly increasing specialist visits. But mostly it 
was clinic work. We were not allowed to 
transport patients in the car.   
42:10 
What is happening now?  
Lots of changes. We ask if they have been 
exposed to COVID,  have you traveled, are 
you being treated for COVID (all before we 
pick them up and travel with them). 
 
 
 
Sanitizing the vehicle at least one a week. 
More if needed. Agency provides all the EPP. 
We have extra masks for the patients.   
44:20 
Are you doing more outreach 
digitally, or virtually?  
Not really, still doing it face to face. Less 
patients but still the same. The provider side 
changes, doing more telemedicine for non 
urgent visits.  
 
 
The other thing that you didn't ask me is about 
the paperwork. We have a computer program 
where we put all of the information, which 
helps to count toward getting funding. The 
agency knows what we have been doing with 
the patient, education, transportation, case 
management, etc. In the referral, we have to 
write a note about the referral. We send 
messages to the provider if it is urgent or they 
can look it up when needed.
