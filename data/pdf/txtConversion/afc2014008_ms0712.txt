I walked over t
o the campus this morning.  I thought it would be a
 
great time for a nice long walk in the autumn weather, and besides I hadn't been
 
able to think of a title for my speech.  It isn't really a speech; it's more
 
a bunch of reminiscences and observations and exhortations -- my grandfather
 
on my mother's side was a Presbyterian minister so I always have to exhort
 
somebody.  Anyway, I thought maybe I could think of a title if I walked and
 
I was enjoying the leaves and the colors and reading the sign about how a
 
sorority was f
ormed by three coeds who couldn't get back home to Tupelo for
 
Christmas because the woads were so bad and one of them w

had such a nice name -- Mary Comfort.  And that brought H
m to my mind the great
 
z
iEl  old blues line about -- "She's built for comfort, she's not built for speed"
 
and that made me feel better because I knew I wasn't going to make it in time
 
for the first paper.  But then my mind slipped off to that great concert we
 
heard last night, and finally it came to me that I gould just call this thing
 
2*zNiiKexhoggzWaikxixz:khRzkfLxEaoxtxy-
Rx "A Nice Walk In the Counxtry" and that's
 
maybe the best I can do for now.

I am greatly honored by your invitation to give this
 
year's
 Seeger lecture.
 I' ve always liked G,- k
 
ethnomusicologists,  you know -- partly because they re
 
generally  just  such a lovable bunch and partly because  I know
 
of few other academic disciplines that are both so tolerant
 
and so self-assured as to allow and even encourage the
 
participation of outriders  like myself.  But then,  here you
 
are with the Seeger Lectures to put on,  and Charles Seeger
 
himself was certainly more than a bit of an outrider.
 
Overall one could describe him as
 a scholar of music,
 I
 
suppose,  but then he was also a composer,  an arranger,  an
 
editor,an educator,  a statesman and a bureaucrat,  and he
 
worked a great deal in matters to do with
 how music might
 
properly and effectively be included in the purview of
 
government,  and also how music might itself affect the course
 
of government.  And he had a wicked and witty side too;  his
 
,
!-
-
-son Pete tells me that in the 30s Charles got the feeling
 
that the politics of the day were  just a bit too solemn and
 
i he cooked up a scheme with some musical friends to put out a
 
series of rounds about rich folks,  and he wrote the music to
 
several of them.  including:
 
Oh  joy upon this earth to live and see the day
 
When Rockefeller Senior will up to me and say
 
Comrade,  can you spare a dime?
 
Actually,  it's hard to think of a single aspect of the
 
world of music that Charles Seeger didn't at least express an
 
op-tnion about.  
II first met him in Washington when I was  15,
 
brought up from Texas by my father John A.  Lomax,  to help him
 
and my brother Alan with their new book,  later to be
 
published as  "Our Singing Country".  It was my first big trip
 
into the big world,  so to say,  and my father's distinguished
 
friend,  Charles Seeger,  at that time seemed immensely old and
 
4
 
2  
immensely knowledgable to me.
 There didn't seem to be
 
anything that he didn't know and he was so sharp-minded and
 
precise and sure.  That whole elegant cool New England
 
intellectual style was completely new to me as a youngster
 
and a southerner besides,  and I was a bit intimidated by it
 
and by Charley,  truth to tell.  So I turned to his wife,  Ruth
 
Crawford Seeger,  I suppose because she was younger and a bit
 
more approachable. And she was a wonderful mother besides, CO3
.
,
t.
, i
t
 
and I got in on just a bit of that great mothering that she
 
exuded from every pore.
 
I am sure that Charley would not take it amiss if I
 
reminisce a bit more about Ruth,  for Ruth was a very
 
important Seeger,  she was indeed,  and I think that somewhere
 
in the ultimate history of the Seeger lectures,  someone
 
should say so.
 At the time I knew her in thelate 30's she
 
was transcribing the music for "Our Singing Country" from
 
father and Alan's field recordings and-- with her left hind
 
foot and a certain amount of household help  (
Elizabeth Cotton
 
was yet to come)  -- she was also raising Michael,  Peggy and
 
Barbara  (
Penny  was yet to come too).  The three children were
 
aged somewhere around  five and three and sort of minus one
 
if my memory is correct.
 
One of my tasks at the time was to act as liaison
 
between my father and brother,  at their book and record
 
strewn desks in the
 Library of Congress,
 and Ruth at her
 
home work-station in Silver Spring,  where she was all fitted
 
out with a record player with a massive sixteen inch
 
turntable for the heavy field recordings plus a set of
 
earphones,  an artist's drafting table with T squares and
 
rulers and pots of Carters India Ink with which she created
 
her elegantly calligraphed musical scores.
 And then there
 
was a small desk with a few pencils,  a telephone,  and a
 
notebook in which she kept a tally of the number of times she
 
listened to every single piece of music in the Our Singing
 
C
 
Country corpus.  Occasionally -- as happens not infrequently
 
in the imperfect art of transcribing songs -- disagreements
 
would arise between the book authors and the musical editor
 
over particular texts or even interpretations of evanescent
 
and tricky melodies,  and it was generally my responsibility
 
to transmit messages from one camp of authorities to the
 
other.
 "Bess,  you tell Ruth that no blues singer God ever
 
made would sing  `redder than rouge'  -- it's  `redder than
 
ru(by)'  with a voice break in the middle-- that's why she
 
doesn't hear it right."
 "Now,  Bess,  you go back and tell
 
Alan and your father that I have listened to this song
 
exactly 78 times all the way through,  not mentioning single
 
verses.
 How many times have they listened to it? Get them to
 
tell me that."
 
It was quite an education,  and I was at the same time
 
being allowed the opportunity to observe an extraordinarily
 
talented and gifted woman functionning in a multiplicity of
 
roles that must have been tearing her apart.
 At one point
 
that year all the children got whooping cough and had to stay
 
home from their day-care center and they played,  rolling
 
about like so many puppies on the living room rug noisily but
 
pleasantly enough  (
"Gentle voices,  gentle voices",  Ruth kept
 
singing to them),  until a whoop would start.The victim would
 
trot docilely off to the bathroom to throw up and Ruth would
 
take off her earphones and go into the kitchen to make a
 
little restorative snack for the sufferer,  see to it that he
 
or she got it down,  and then return to the 79th careful
 
listening to
 "Go Down,  You Old Red Rising Sun" or the 112th
 
to "Bonaparte's Retreat Across the Rocky Mountains"
 
And then Charley would come home from work - was it then
 
the Writers Project or the Pan American Union? - and
 
everything would stop.  He would beam largely around upon us
 
all and give Barbara  (
the crib baby)  a special flare of his
 
hand,  a kind of starfish effect that she would always return
 
q-
in kind;  and then special hugs all round and a nice settle-
down by the fireplace with  (
generally)  Peggy on his knee. The
 
rest of us showed off for his attention, but at heart the
 
family action always really swirled around Ruth.
 
Oh dear Ruth.
 She was indeed so dear that the children
 
and even Charley called her "Deo".
 She taught me a lot about
 
how to be a grown-up and a woman and for that I will never
 
forget her,  but she also taught me something else that she
 
possibly wasn't aware of.  She taught me that professional,
 
academically trained,  avant garde, politically  radical,
 
totally up to the minute  musicians like Charles Seeger and
 
Ruth Crawford Seeger could and did stand in awe of the
 
musical achievements of old country ladies,  black stevedores,
 
Mexican field workers,  Ohio canal boat captains,  and all the
 
other amazing casts of characters my father and brother had
 
been for so long re-introducing to their own homeland
 
audiences.  I already sort of knew all this,  of course,  but it
 
was Ruth who diagrammed out for me how smoothly and
 
inevitably a 5/4 meter worked in a Cajun ballad,  how
 
rhythmically complex an apparently routine Kentucky fiddle
 
tune turned out to be,  how a meltingly liquid Alabama field
 
holler really defied standard music notation. And so it was
 
through Ruth and Charles Seeger that I began to realize that
 
the musics I had heard most of  my life on field recordings
 
were,  in their exceptional performances,  as totally excellent
 
as the exceptional performances of any other musical
 
tradition -- even the Baroque,  even the Romantic.
 
For I had been brought up as a classical pianist,  and
 
although I had heard field recordings all my life,  I found
 
myself following  Charles and Ruth through their process of
 
discovery in dealing with my father's and brother's
 
recordings with just a bit of their feelings of genuine
 
surprise.  The senior Seegers had listened widely to the
 
musics of Africa and the far Eastvbut they had not heard the
 
United States,  and thus their entire musical training --
sophisticated and wide-ranging as it was
 bbAW 96
im m -- had
 
not prepared them for the sonorities of north Georgia shape
 
note hymn singing or Mississippi
 work choruses.
 
Hearing Ruth and Charles Seeger professionally and seriously
 
discussing the musical qualities of field hollers and banjo
 
tunes opened a door that I hadn't known  was closed,  and made
 
me literally face the music.
 
For you see,  in the other part of my day,  I was being
 
trained by my father and my brother as a folklorist as well.
 
My particular responsibility at the time -- and at the age of
 
15 it was a mind-boggling assignment,  especially since it was
 
real -- was to help annotate the songs that were being put
 
into Our Singing Country:  that is,  I was to search through
 
other collections of traditional songs and ballads in order
 
to be able to cite parallel texts and tunes from which the
 
history of individual songs might one day be established.
 I
 
read through all the great literary collections -- Child,
 
Sharp,  Randolph,  Belden,  Frank C,  Brown -- and I could see
 
what these great collectors were talking about: there were
 
indeed songs - specific conjoined texts and tunes - that
 
seemed to move independently,  infinitely flexible but somehow
 
invariably recognizable no matter in what guise they turned
 
up.
 
For even the world of music was in many ways confined to
 
print in those days,  and it was because of the
 
unchallengeable authority of the printing press that we were
 
still laboring almost exclusively with concepts from the pre-
electronic past although my own father and brother were major
 
leaders in using the new and developing electronic capacities
 
to capture the actual act of musical performance.
 
But certainly  most folk music lovers of the 30's and
 
40's still thought that it was "the song"-- a conj incd -
f
't. �
4I&t
 
package of words and one or two particular tunes -- that
 
really mattered,  so that we constantly hunted for "good ones"
 
that could encircle the globe and bring us all together and
 
solve all manner of problems andmake us brave and fearless a- 1
 
and  educate us to our beautiful differences. And so we
 
happily chased songs around the countryside and when we
 
caught one we thought nothing of writing a simplified version
 
of it down and publishing it and fixing it up in ways that
 
would make it especially appealing to one kind of taste or
 
another and teaching it to all manner of other people.
 
After all,  that had always been the way of it throughout
 
history,  hadn't  it?  Folk  and  traditional  musics  existed
 
primarily to inspire and feed and nourish the higher musical
 
arts,  didn't they? ) W
ost people still think so,, And A
 
I was
 
a teen-ager working at the Library of Congress,  such eminent
 
composers  as  Aaron  Copland  and  Virgil  Thompson  came  in
 
looking for some  interesting musical  folk idioms perhaps but
 
particularly
 some solid and long-lasting melodies for use in
 
their  symphonic  compositions.  And  I helped  find  the  field
 
recordings  that  they  listened to and later put  to extensive
 
use.  Shoot,  Charles  Seeger  himself  composed  a  symphonic
 
variation  that  wove  together  7 or  8 of  the  many  elegant
 
melodies  folks  had  developed  for  a single  romantic ballad,
 
"John  Riley".
 *fears  later
 t I heard  Leonard
 
Bernstein  say  that  he  thought  the  hardest  single  part  of
 
musical  composition, was  to  latch  on  to  a really  good  and
 
memorable tune.)  No wonder American composers were interested
 
to find an archive full of them!
 
So the composers sat in the Archive of American Folksong
 
jotting  down  the  tunes  of  the  songs  they  heard,
 and
 
professional copyists  copied down any transcribed tunes they
 
could find so that music publishers could copyright them,  and
 
the  people  who  wanted  to  learn  songs  or  teach  them  to
 
children in school  looked inside  folk song books  for sources
 
7
 
of material,  and  folklorists  spent  months  and years  chasing
 
down  the  original
 author/composer  of  particular  songs
 
believing  sincerely that  when they had  found that  out,  they
 
would  know the single  thing  that  was  the  most  important  to
 
know about them.  Remember,  every song was a thing and things
 
have  makers  and  copiers  and  owners  and  big  money-making
 
industries  can  be  built  around  them  and  were.
 But  the
 
recording machine -- well,  that took the song out of the book
 
and the library and the printing press and brought it to life
 
as an event in time and space.
 
But each time a song was recorded it was a new event and
 
these things multiplied and pretty soon each song was kind of
 
a conglomeration of multiple events complete with multiple
 
variations and after a while what on earth was it you were
 
dealing with?
 I remember hearing Charles Seeger say once
 
that the only truly unchangeable and therefore copyrightable
 
thing about a piece of music was the pattern of the grooves
 
cut into a record. And now we don't even have grooves any
 
more and we are still dealing with the challenging  effects
 
of this revolutionary shift of emphasis from print to sound,
 
And of course many people from McLuhan on have commented on
 
this but perhaps not from the perspective I saw it as it was
 
happening.
 
It always was a struggle.  For the early recordists to do
 
their field work,  it was not only ^ 
intellectual but downright
 
physical �Even after the period of the cyllinder and the
 
fearsome horn into which only the RCA dog seemed able to sing
 
with any pleasure,  came the enormous back-breaking "portable"
 
recording machines,  each one run off of 4 to 6 automobile
 
batteries,  and served by weighty boxes of 16 inch discs. At
 
one point in the 40s when Father took the daring step of
 
buying a brand new Ford to take him just once more through
 
the southern backwoods,  he had the garage rip out the whole
 
back seat and install a built-in platform with a special set
 
S, 
of shock absorbers to accomodate the burden.
 And I will
 
spare you my views of the horrors of the subsequent wire
 
recorders,  their huge tangled spools eyed grimly by the most
 
dauntless of  L.C.  sound engineers.
 
But other major consequences kept on rippling out from
 
the central disturbance -- for example the specific singer of
 
a song,  typically recognized in print by a simple footnote,
 
became in recordings a "performin  artist"
 a person of
 
prominence and importance u Indeed in popular music,  the name
 
of the artist came to be far more commercially valuable than
 
the name of the song,  and recording contracts were proof of
 
that,  even saving royalty money by requiring singers to
 
compose their own songs since nobody much care kabout what
 
song they*-r
-e singing anyway.  (
Parenthetically this I believe
 
accounts at least to a degree for the massive decline in
 
quality of the American popular song in recent years; there
 
are lots more good song singers than song writers.)
 
Another major change was the enormous increase in the
 
availability for the general listener of both local American
 
and worldwide musics.  Only fifty years ago -- say in 1943,
 
you could not listen seriously to African-American work song
 
singers or Mexican-American corridistas or Anglo-American
 
shape note congregations unless you travelled to the place
 
where they were actually making the music or visited the
 
Archive of American Folk Songs at the Library of Congress or
 
the Sound Archives at the University of Indiana.  There were
 
some spasmodic commercial recordings but basically it was
 
these somewhat daunting academic archives that held in trust
 
the voices of the varied  peoples of the United States]-- the
 
non-standard,  specialized,  quirky, powerful,  angry,, hopeful
 
people who had broken free from the second-handedness of
 
print and allowed their especial musical talents their
 
especial musical visions and their own voices to be recorded
 
for the benefit of -- God knows who they thought.
 
9
 
I recently listened to some old field recordings my
 
father made and every time he recorded a tune he said,  "This
 
song was sung by Mister so and so of such and such a town
 
recording on thus and such a date for the Library of Congress
 
in Washington." He made it sound so important. Maybe they
 
thought the Congress was going to listen to  hem -- or maybe
 
President Roosevelt. Maybe,  in a way,  that's
 
.uc  what did
 
happen; things certainly aren't the same as they used to be.
 
For whenever I like I can now listeAto the major
 
repertoires of hundreds of different world-wide cultures and
 
almost every small group in every state in the union.(If I
 
had my brother's magical "Global Jukebox" at my personal
 
disposal,  I could not only triple or quadruple this
 
repertoire but  vastly enhance with critically important
 
ethnographic information and film the musics available to me
 
at a fingertip). And all this richness is right there for
 
anybody --awkward to get hold of maybe  and costly, but still
 
it is there and it usen't to be there.  It couldn't be got
 
hold of before.  Thanks to the prevailing recording machine,
 
these musics are no longer within the private purview of the
 
people who happen to live in a particular part of the world,
 
or the people who have troubled to go to that part of the
 
world,  or the people who have announced themselves to be
 
world music students and scholars.
 
And this is a brand new state of affairs. The nature,
 
significance and responsibilities of the work of folklore and
 
ethnomusicology have changed forever. Nothing is a simple
 
one-way street anymore. Everything works differently in
 
imponderable and disconcerting ways. A couple of years ago  a
 
Boston friend told me a story about a Masssachusetts student
 
of African music who had climaxed his studies by spending
 
several years in a particular African nation as a disciple of
 
a particular master tribal drummer. Upon his return to the
 
United States,  the young student determined to try to
 
I
D
 
recreate in all its glory the marvellous music he had tried
 
to learn,  and in the process he transformed himself into a
 
one-man band,  attaching pulleys and levers to his body
 
through which he could sound the bell pattern with his right
 
hand while he led the mama drum with his left foot and
 
handled the shakers by nodding his head and so forth.  It was
 
an enormously complex venture and he was legitimately proud
 
when he could finally bring it all off,  cross rhythms and
 
all. And then  he heard that his old teacher from Africa was
 
coming to town with a visiting troupe.  He delightedly made an
 
appointment to see him at his hotel,  he arrayed himself for a
 
triumphal performance and he played his heart out. And his
 
teacher looked at him affectionately and remarked,  "Oh,  you
 
poor fellow. Don't you have any friends?"
 
Here we see African musical standards being applie
-d--to
 
European musical tactics and what are we to make of that?

and folklorists and ethnomusicologists
 
are no longer lonely explorers into uncharted areas  (
if ever
 
we were).  These days we are engaged in continual
 
conversations with everybody -- musicians,  educators,  deans,
 
concert promoters,  singers,  radio producers,  griots,  record
 
company executives,  community activists, politicians, t gtk_rc,� 
students,  and the Lord knows who all.  The one man band is out
 
for us.
 
Folklorists are perhaps a bit more used to this,  since
 
their work though generally distributed in print has used the
 
alphabet rather than specialized notation methods and *e14 . 
,
s
 
emphasized the English language. And as general literacy
 
became the norm folklorists'  so-called informants could and
 
did read the books in which their material was printed and
 
they were duly critical of the results,  all the way from how
 
the book royalties were handled,  down to the iconography --
"It's neither right spelt nor right setten'  down" as an irate
 
lady remarked to Sir Walter Scott on one historic occasion.
 
i
t
 
So none of us who consider ourselves scholars,  lovers,
 
savants,  of music any longer work alone if ever we did.  But
 
neither are we irrelevant.  In fact I believe that the work of
 
the afficionado,  the dedicated student and the deep lover of
 
particular art forms  (
from inside and outside the culture)
 
may become ever more important and ever more crucial as time
 
goes by.  One of the more troubling assumptions of our period
 
is that any member of any group by simple virtue of that
 
membership  has an inborn and unmatchable intellectual tie
 
with its cultural manifestations. Not so.  It would be so nice
 
if it were that simple, but many - possibly even most -
people both of the majority and of smaller groups are simply
 
not interested.  They have chosen to focus their efforts upon
 
other fields,  and that is well. We don't need everyone to be
 
a cultural authority.  But we do need some,  and it is plain
 
that the kind of perspective essential to the understanding
 
of any art form is developed through intense,  disciplined and
 
comparative study,  no matter if the student is an insider or
 
an outsider of the particular culture.  For both it represents
 
hard self-dedicated work and attentiveness,  the kind of
 
strict professional attention I saw Ruth and Charles Seeger
 
devoting to my father's and brother's field recordings.
 
But what,  in another fifty years,  will be there be for
 
us insiders or outsiders,  or our insider and outsider grand-
children,  to study? When I look at a record or a tape or a
 
c.d.  these days and note the date when the recording was
 
actually made,  I begin to wonder.  They were all made so long
 
ago.  Even the new ones tend to be re-releases.  In fact,  when
 
I talk to young people today about how they should be doing
 
field work,  especially  recording,  they tell me gently that
 
all that kind of thing has already been done. And I laugh,
 
but then could it really be true? Can it really be that the
 
peoples of the world are abandoning their own glorious
 
historical musical achievements in order that their young
 
people can grab a few dimes off of today's amplified pop

Way back in the fall of 1975 I attended my first SEM
 
meeting with the idea of telling the membership that during
 
the summer of 1976 a marvellous event was to take place in
 
Washington,  D.C.  -- a summer-long Festival of American Folk
 
Life during which traditional artists from across the United
 
States would conjoin with traditional artists from their
 
original country or tribe.  At the least,  I said in my naive
 
enthusiasm,  exciting previously unheard musicians would be
 
appearing on the Mall
 and at the best,  some significant
 
interchanges between old and new world musicians might occur
 
that might lead to some re-invigoration of marginal musics.

I was quite unprepared for the general lack of

responding speaker that the events I was projecting  were
 
only of marginal interest to the Society,  that festivals were
 
purely temporal events of no long-term consequence,  that the

musics under the onslaught of national popular musics.  Jeez.
 
How bleak.  How unappealing.  Surely the whole discipline,  I
 
thought,  can't approve.  I mean,  who wants to be someone who
 
only gets to take notes on the relative rate of decay of
 
something?
 Maybe I didn't get it right.
 
And of course I hadn't. Many ethnomusicologists
 
contributed to,  learned from,  and delighted in that vast
 
summer spectacle.  I had many chances to talk with them,  and I
 
came to realize that many had truly deep concerns about the
 
appropriateness of their participation in such events.  Their
 
training had been that scholars should always remain separate
 
from the topic they stud y that they must in every way
 
1
i
 
attempt not to influence the course of its development.  This is, if nothing
 
else, a position that grants a certain dignity to both parties involved - the s
 
students and the studied.  But others had other points of view.
 
For one thing, it is plain to many that culture never is a simple
 
popularity contest, with winner take all.  Within any ongoing population
 
there will always be xx several active artistic traditions -- old-timey,
 
new-fangled, idio-synctatic, original, imitative, archaic -- all concurrent,
 
all jostling for place and a piece of the action, all lively and meaningful.
 
Different forces within and w
:k:
Kkaxtx
:kkR outside the culture support and further
 
different choices within this menu.  Personally, I tend to find that I am
 
a unregenerat
4 moldy fig and I invariably announce that point of view so that
 
it can be taken into account as xI rave on, and nobody seems to mind that much.
 
But I think some of us feel that it is somehow unfair for scholars and
 
savants to express anything but total neutrality in such ongoing cultural
 
struggles.  Aside :
Emxxx from neutrality's making for awfully boring conversations,
 
I think this position over-estimates the actual weight of our opinions. At
 
the Folk Arts Program in the Arts Endowment we found out quickly the limits of f
f
 
outsider views -- even those that are backed by grant monies -- for although
 
our scholarly panel might vote not to fund a project, the local folks very often
 
went right on ahead and did it anyway.  And I have to say that gave me a lot of
 
confidence in the good sense of everyone concerned -- the panel and the folks.
 
In the short term, then, it is rare for scholars and savants to wield xmRxx
 
coercive power.  Our contributions tend to work towards slanting, mediating,
 
highlighting, pointing things out, maybe mushing them up -- but generally we
 
serve inter-connecting functions.  So most of the time we ARRdx$:k needn't worry
 
that our pronouncements are going to change anything in particular or that we
 
will do anything catastrophic by publicly expressing our delight in, concern
 
for, or worries about such phenomena as local musical traditions and artists.

 and I have had that proven to us over and 
over

misfire, subside, explode, and thrive.  And we learned that every form of

d.  Every ethnomusicologist should take on the
 
responsibility of developing some minimal degree of practical
 
entrepreneurship,  learning how to make our special musics
 
broadly accessible.  There are so many ways to do this -- good
 
solid academic ways.
 
I recently read a report from a folklorist who became
 
fascinated with a particular African American religious song
 
tradition practiced in rural areas around his host
 
university.
 He followed it from little church to little
 
church,  mapped out its provenience,  made friends with the
 
folks who sang it and the ministers whose churches hosted it,
 
and after a couple of years developed it into his
 
dissertation topic.
 So far -- so normal. But he also worked
 
out with the practicing groups the following scheme:  a
 
recording was produced from his field work that followed the
 
traditional course of one of their musical sessions but
 
included many of the active singers. He applied for grant
 
money to produce both cassettes and CD's of the result,
 
distributing more than 600 casssettes to group members as
 
partial honoraria and more than 400 complimentary CDs to
 
archives,  historical societies,  college libraries,  non-profit
 
radio stations etc.  in the area.  Publication of the recording
 
was heralded by a public symposium at which both academic and
 
religious leaders spoke and each of the 29 still active
 
musical groups in the region were publicly awarded an
 
honorarium of $250.00 -- the largest single expense of the
 
1
7
 
project.
 Future profits
 (
in terms of royalties which will
 
undoubtedly be microscopic)  are being placed in a trust fund
 
for the Singing and Praying Bands,  as they call themselves,
 
three members of which have been elected as trustees along
 
with the director of the local museum and the project
 
director
 
It is too early to tell the effect of this project upon
 
the music itself -- like many another vivid and electrifying
 
music it comes from a non-standard doctrinal group whose
 
activities are often snubbed by more respectable uptown
 
churches,  and some disa reement over their increased
 
M%.
 A  
prominence
 =eoe ^
��t i
 �^ ems- is to be expected. But overall
 
the project RPPms to me a model of responsible broad-brush
 
inclusive planning,  clearly and positively educational,  in
 
the best sense of the term. The project director recently
 
received a letter written by the son of two of the local
 
singers  (
on stationery from the Wall Street firm where he
 
works) :
 
. .in this age of Afro-centrism - or the adding of
 
value to the history of people of African descent-  (
your)
 
work takes on increased importance. No longer will my
 
forefathers be looked at as wild beasts who are too ignorant
 
to know any better,  but as Africans who adopted Christianity
 
and brought their age-old,  traditional style of worship to
 
this new faith and new land. Be encouraged,  your work is
 
greatly appreciated.
 . . " Now that's a letter to get,
 
isn't it?
 Good as an A any day.
 
I think there are hundreds of such potential projects
 
lying around just waiting for an energetic,  competent,
 
responsible, patient scholar to add his or her expertise to
 
the mix.  Don't worry;  you won't get far if the musicians
 
themselves don't want to work with you or if the project
 
tzit

really doesn't suit the folks.

I want to close with a challenge.  I have recently
 
resigned from the National Endowment for the Arts,  a federal
 
granting agency charged with the following mission:
 "to
 
foster the excellence,  diversity and vitality of the arts in
 
the United States today and to help broaden the availability
 
and appreciation of such excellence,  diversity and vitality."
 
Did you know about that? Did you know that that language is
 
now part of the law of our land.  It still gives me
 
goosebumps. But there it is and it didn't use to be.
 We
 
didn't think about music or art in that way. But now we have
 
a clear statement codified into legalese and well expressed
 
and it says that the work of the musician,  the dancer,  the
 
artist has stature and is a proper matter of national
 
concern.  The arts are right up there with housing and foreign
 
relations and commerce and national defense.
 
Of course they don't get much money. The overall funds
 
the National Endowment for the Arts has to distribute in
 
terms of grants is in the neighborhood of 175 million,  give
 
or take a million or twos  T h
a
t really is peanuts in
 
Washington terms. Bu
I took the peanuts and sorted them out
 
f
t
f-
roughly and came up with some interesting figures - large
 
approximations,  of course.
 
Something over 600 of the 175 M goes out directly to
 
fund arts projects and institutions rather than being given
 
out through state or regional or local arts agencies. Of
 
that,  about 25% goes to various efforts to support what most
 
people call classical music -- opera,  choral,  chamber,
 
symphonic ,even jazz -- a figure of 17 or 18 million dollars.
 
The two Endowment programs that fund all other kinds of music
 
(
along with all other genres of traditional arts)  have
 
devoted at a generous figure perhaps a third of their budgets
 
to funding music projects -- together perhaps $3 million
 
dollars.
 
M 
So, of the total number of dollars made available by the
 
Congress
 for nation-wide support of the arts,  approximately
 
14% goes to the general area of music of which
 
12% goes to "classical" western European music leaving
 
for  
 other musics including:
-
folk
 
as well as such indigenous forms as the blues,  blue grass,
 
gospel,  conjunto,  salsa,  klezmer, et al.
 
It's kind of shocking,  isn't it? 
When I was working at
 
the Endowment,  for the last five or six years I used to feel
 
I was swimming desperately in an indoor pool and that the
 
level of the water -- the level of demand -- kept on 
rising
 
so that there was less and less air between me and the
 
music",  the classical musics of non-western European cultures
 
ceiling and no matter how hard I swam I couldn't push that
 
roof any higher.  I was s
�&
��stuck.
 
zm
 
have valiantly raised the issue of our
 
Lazed
 
academics time and again.  But we must never stop. We must
 
seek new sources of strength, perhaps through alliances with
 
other groups both academic and lay. Throughout this over-long
 
paper I have been emphasizing the changes that I have seen
 
during this half-century.  The simple dyad of author/reader is
 
now only one way of communicating; with recording and
 
television,  communication goes every which way,  the
 
conversation is enormously extended,  much to our mutual
 
benefit,  I believe,  and thus we may find ourselves able to
 
join hands with previously unsuspected allies ) But there is
 
much to do.

Q. wC fl
 
At the 1992 Festival of the Pacific Arts in Rarotonga in
 
the Cook Islands there was a pre-festival conference that I
 
was allowed to attend as observer. One of the participants
 
was an elegant,  dignified and gentle-spoken senior woman from
 
American Samoa who spoke as follows;  (
this is not verbatim,
 
but I take good notes and here is what she said.)
 "I was
 
born and brought up in American Samoa,  but I went to the
 
United States for my advanced education,  and I am now back
 
home working as an educator in my turn. During my
 
undergraduate and graduate career in several American
 
universities,  I took many art appreciation courses,  some in
 
visual and some in the musical arts,  and I loved them. But
 
now that I am back home,  I realize that I never once heard
 
any music other than European in any of my classes. And now I
 
am president of the Community College in American Samoa,  the
 
only institution of higher education there,  andI hope someday
 
to be able to learn about the music of the Pacific Islands."
 
And I found myself 
d embarrassed and
 ashamed.  I
 
hardly knew where to look,  especially since I don't think
 
things are
 
the
 bit better now than when she was
 
receiving he
 r "education"
 Think back to those devastating
 
budget figures )and this in a time when "multi-culturalism" is
  
the watchword and hardly anybody knows what it means. Can't
 
21
 
we grab that multi-cultural ball and do some running with it?  As an
 
organization?  As a discipline?  Suppose we took as a simple common purpose to see
 
to it that no American will ever again go through their education without
 
hearing just one piece of music from a Pacific Island -- China -- Africa --
Alaska -- the other places of the world we all live together in?  Could we
 
not work up a plan for that to send to Washington (
which is a very different
 
place these days) so that nobody agxaR ever again can say what that college
 
president said.  I think a lot of people would support that.  Couldn't we
 
give i
t a try?
 
Thank you again for inviting me.

INTRO FOR BESS,  10/29/93
 
It's  a  great  pleasure  to  have  the  opportunity  to  say  a  few
 
introductory words about Bess  Lomax Hawes,  a person I
've been so
 
close to for so long.  When I sat down this morning to put together
 
these few remarks,  I started thinking about  just how close  I had
 
been to Bess--geographically as well  as emotionally--over the 14
 
years we worked together at the National Endowment  for the Arts.
 
For most of my waking hours on most days during that time,  I wasn't
 
more than about 20 feet away from Bess.
 Now that's close.  And I
  
assure you,  it was a privilege,  an education,  and a iov.  
But  don't worry,  Bess,  I won't qo  into how  in your more annoyed
 
moments  you  would  say  things  like  "professional  grant  writers
  
should  be
 strangled
 in
 their
 cribs"
 or
 how
 "certain  arts
  
administrators should be strung up by their fingernails."
  
I only
 
want to dwell on the happier moments.
 
As  you  may  know,  Bess  comes  from  a  family  of  many  cultural
 
specialists.
 I got to see this fact celebrated in a most unlikely
 
way  at  a certain  time  of  year  for many  of  Bess's  years  at  the
 
Endowment.
 It  was  during  the  annual  hearings  before  the House
 
subcommittee on the Endowment's appropriations.
 When it came to
 
Bess's  turn  to  testify  about  needs  in  the  folk  arts  field,  it
 
turned into a love  fest.
 Chairman Sidney Yates would invariably
 
start  by  asking  "How's  your  brother  Alan?"
 And  sometimes  they
 
would  get  off  onto  how  her  father  John  Lomax  was  a pioneer  in
 
American folklore work,  how her daughter Naomi and her niece Anna
 
were  anthropologists,  how her  son Nick  was  a musician  and  folk
 
music
 consultant,
 how
 her
 son-in-law
 John
 Bishop
 was
 an
 
ethnographic filmmaker,  and so  forth.
 And Bess would  joke about
 
how with so many relatives potentially applying to the Endowment,
 
she was, quote,  "a walking case of potential conflict of interest."
 
By the way, when I took over for Bess in 1992 and had my first turn
 
at  the  table,  before  I could even make  it  up to  the  table,  Mr.
 
Yates asked "So,  are you related to Bess Hawes,  too?"
 All I could
 
think to say was,  "I  feel  like I am."
 
I thought I might give you a biographical introduction to Bess by
 
telling you a little about what happened at her  retirement party
 
about a year and a half  ago.
 A number of us  conspired to bring
 
together tribute and testimony from various points throughout her
 
life,  and it turned into a cross between "This Is your Life" and a
 
multimedia,  potluck resume.
 
Tony Seeger,  Joe Hickerson,  and friends put together a one-of-a-
kind  Smithsonian  Folkways  anthology  of  the  music  of  Bess  Lomax
 
Hawes.
 It  started  in  the  mid  1930s,  with  Bess  singing  an
 
unaccompanied  ballad  she  learned  from  a traditional  singer  her
 
father worked with and she admired so much.
 Then it gave a sense
 
of  Bess's  social  milieu  of  the  late  1930s,  with  Bess,  Charlie
 
Seeger,  Ruth Seeger,  Pete Seeger,  Alan Lomax,  and her father John
 
Lomax  trading  verses  back  and  forth.
 Then  it  followed  Bess's
 
singing career with the Almanac  Singers,  a seminal  group of  the
 
Folk Revival,  and we found an old photo of Bess and the Almanacs
 
when they went to Detroit to sing in support of the auto workers
 
who  were  having  their  share  of  hard  times.
 And  it  ended  with
 
"Charlie  on  the  MTA,"  the  song  she  co-authored  that  reached
 
millions through the recordings of  it by the Kingston Trio.
 But
 
the version on the Folkways tape was the original,  written not as
 
a pop song,  but as a song with a clear social purpose.
 It was a
 
campaign song for a Boston politician whose platform opposed fare
 
hikes on the MTA that might hurt those who most depended on public
 
transportation.
 
Then there were  flowers and notes  from her three children--Cori,
 
Naomi,  and  Nick--whom she  raised  in  the  late  1940s,  1950s,  and
 
1960s.
 And there were letters from her university colleagues in
 
the 1960s and early 1970s who offered a repreise of applause for
 
her  book  Step  It  Down_, _on  Black  folk  song,  coauthored  with the
 
great Georgia Sea Islands singer and loremaster Bessie Jones,  and
 
her films "Pizza Pizza Daddy-O" on Black children's games and "Say,
 
Old  Man,
 Can  You  Play  the  Fiddle?"  on  an  Anglo  fiddler  in
 
California.
 There was even some mention of her master's thesis at
 
UC Berkeley,  written on the "Happy Birthday"  song,  that has to be
 
one of the most in-demand unpublished master's theses ever written.
 
At that point, those of us her knew her from around the early 1970s
 
took up the thread of her career, as she moved from Los Angeles, to
 
Washington,  DC,  following  the  death  of  her  beloved  husband  and
 
long-time partner in song, Butch Hawes.
 In Washington, she became
 
Deputy Director on one of the most ambitious fieldwork and public
 
presentation  projects  in  history,  the  Smithsonian  Festival  of
 
American folklife in the Bicentennial years of  1975 and 1976.
 
On January 1
,  1977,  Bess took all this experience to the National
 
Endowment for the Arts, where whe took over the emerging folk arts
 
initiative from Alan Jabbour, who moved to the Library of Congress.
 
Her first goal was to put the Folk Arts Program on a bureaucratic
 
footing with that of all  the other forms of  artistic expression.
 
She did this in a year flat--lightning speed for government work,
 
belive me--and the Folk Arts Program became official in February of
 
1978.
 
She then started working to create folk arts programs at the state
 
and local laevels,  since most of the needs of traditional artists
 
are local ones and require someone closer to home than Washington,
 
DC to fulfill them.
 In 1977, there was one state folklorist.  When
 
Bess retired in 1992,  there were 50 state folk arts coordinators,
 
all with the mandate of assisting artists, not just studying them.
 
Bess saw the potential  of gaining public recognition for  some of
 
tahe  United  States's  most  accomplished  folk  artists,  and almost
 
single-handedly created the National Heritage Fellowship program,
 
something akin to Japan's Liveing Treasures.
 
We all tried hard that day to give Bess the tribute she deserved.
 
But then,  three weeks ago,  we were upstaged by none other than the
 
President of  the United States,  when Bill  Clinton awarded Bess--
along
 with
 Arthur
 Miller,
 Cab
 Calloway,
 Ray
 Charles,
 the
 
Annenbergs,
 and
 several
 other
 distinguished
 Americans--the
 
Presidential  Medal  of  Arts.
 (Applause)
 When  the  President
 
presented the award to her  in a ceremony at the White House,  she
 
said "I only wish all the wonderful artists I worked with could be
 
here to receive it with me."
 
Those words reminded me of what one of those artists once said that
 
summed  up  so  many  wonderful  feelings  about  Bess.
 His  name  is
 
Camille Macedon--better known as  "King Derby"--a calypso champion
 
and singer of kwelbe songs of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
After a thirty-minute meeting with Bess that stretched into three
 
hours, with Bess giving every bit of helpful advice she could think
 
of,  Derby  turned  to  me  and  said,  "Now  I see why  they named  her
 
Bess--' cause she dee bess!"
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  Bess Lomax Hawes!

MONTGOMERY,  ALABAMA/ALAMOSA,  COLORADO
 9/14-19/93
 
ALABAMA
 
Arrived 5:00 p. m.  in Montgomery,  picked up by Hank,  supper
 
with Erin Kellen and her husband John  (
I think),  a free-lance
 
writer/editor working for the Encyclopedia Britannica.  He
 
also turns out to be a Sacred Harp aficionado,  very irritated
 
with Joe Wilson because he  (Kellen)  made many suggestions as
 
to good ways to present Sacred Harping at the National
 
especially offering to help with the northern Alabama folks
 
and Joe kind of turned it over to a buddy of his in Tennessee
 
whose expertise is dubious,  the Kellens say.  I don't know one
 
way or the other.  Erin is pregnant,  due next spring when she
 
will resign;  she doesn't intend to return to full time work
 
for several years.  Hank will recruit for her position as
 
archivist/folklorist some time in the near future.  Hank and I
 
gossipped a while about Alabama politics et al and so to bed.
 
9/15 to the Alabama Center for Traditional Culture,  visited a
 
bit with Anne Kimzey mostly in re her radio series which is
 
plowing slowly onward  (
see list of shows attached),I think
 
it's interesting stuff and good coverage but it takes her an
 
awfully long time to do each show -- certainly ages more than
 
the Wisconsin Downhome Dairyland shows-- and the actual air
 
times are 6 minutes each for Alabama and 30-60 for Wisconsin.
 
They are quite different in content,  however,  Ann's being
 
brief radio-style spots and the WDD longer more leisurely
 
music shows.
 
The Alabama Folklife Association had a board meeting from
 
12:00 to 2:00 -- a nice group of old friends including Joey
 
Brackner,  Joyce Cauthen  (
re-elected president),  Russell
 
Gulley  (
DeKalb County Fiddlers radio)  and about eight others.
 
They are an energetic bunch,  talking relatively little hooey,
 
and,  astonishingly,  in the fiscal black due to their active
 
publication and t-shirt sales promotions.)  They are planning
 
to produce a series of tapes with and for local musicians,
 
starting,  I think,  with the Sterling Jubilees who Joyce
 
reports are getting on but still in good voice and have no
 
tapes to sell at their concerts.  Hank will keep an eye on
 
this project but Joyce will be the director.The Association
 
is also publishing the ALABAMA FOLKLIFE JOURNAL  (
See attached
 
table of contents;  I was really impressed at the breadth and
 
depth of the planned essays,  assuming their quality).The
 
strength of Alabama overall,  I believe,  is the effort made by
 
the Folklife Association,  the Center and Joey Brackner's
 
program to develop intellectually independent but mutually
 
supportive projects;  they don't seem to waste their time
 
feuding but actually help each other and it's such a
 
pleasure.  Al Head's steady support and good sense plus Hank's
 
negotiating abilities are probably key. My only complaint
 
about Alabama overall  (
and it's shared by Hank)  is that it
 
i
 
seems to me that the rate of work is awfully relaxed and the
 
output pretty small.
 
At 2:00,  the Advisory Board of the Alabama Center for
 
Traditional Culture began.  Hank reported on plans for the 7th
 
annual capitol city shape note hymn sing,  and the Folklife
 
Festival for 1974.  He has come up with a nifty idea,  I think,
 
for the Festival - a special extra stage that will celebrate
 
the whole range of black and white Alabama religious singing
 
styles and repertoires;  his notion is that this is really
 
where Alabama shines and always has - I do believe brother
 
Alan would agree with him.
 Anyway,  it will include black and
 
white shape note,  Dr.  Watts,  spirituals,  unaccompanied and
 
accompanied gospel,  a capella quartets,  long meter hymns,
 
gospel - the whole ball of wax,  and he plans -- get this,  an
 
important idea,  I think - to schedule various groups to sit
 
in the audience from time to time in between their own shows
 
so they can help bear up the traditions that aren't so used
 
to presenting themselves on stage.  I urged him onward as did
 
his board.
 
Said board by the way includes Consuela Lee,  Director of the
 
Snow Hill Institute,  a hundred year old black boarding school
 
turned cultural center. Mrs.  Lee is Spike Lee's sister;  she
 
attracted me before I knew the relationship by complaining
 
that Hank hadn't included spirituals by name in his
 
discussion of the foregoing plan and then -- when Hank played
 
some field recordings to flesh out his idea,  reacting  most
 
strongly to a lining out hymn,  saying -- that's the stuff,
 
that's what we have to get in there.  She is apparently a
 
classically trained pianist of some international reputation
 
who has come back home and seized upon this ancient school as
 
a possible organizing center for music and other types of
 
education. We liked each other right away,  I think,  and I
 
think she could be of real help -- maybe even a panelist? --
needs to be talked with more.
 
Hank also took up a variety of ongoing projects including the
 
column he sends out to rural newspapers  (
cf.  attached list of
 
topics).  He says this is a most successful way of
 
communicating around the state -- his columns are printed in
 
almost every rural weekly -- and he recommends the idea to
 
other rural states.  Finally he presented the attached map of
 
Alabama along with a proposal that there should eventually be
 
8 regional folklorists in Alabama to cover the map.  That's
 
far in the future,  of course,  but I bet you will hear from
 
Hank looking for funds for at least one of these positions in
 
the next year or two.  It occurred to me later that this is
 
exactly the opposite strategy of the one that developed
 in
 
Colorado -- Hank is building from the center out;  Colorado
 
from the periphery in.  I have to say it looks to me as though
 
both strategies were effective in their own areas.
 
COLORADO
 
9/16/93.
 Caught 7:00 a.m.  plane for Atlanta,  changed for
 
Denver,  changed again for Alamosa,  a teensy one room airport,
 
arriving around 2:00 after running to make my connection.
 
(
Pat S.- for future site visits for Colorado:  I was surprised
 
to find the altitude really bothered me when I had to exert
 
myself which was necessary both coming in and going out; my
 
heart just kept on pounding too hard.  Since it's really
 
countryfied around there,  things don't usually work by the
 
clock and I
' d recommend that you advise really easy
 
scheduling.  Even Denver is a mile high and the San Luiz
 
Valley,  where I was,  is almost 8,000 feet;  nobody really
 
ought to run during a short-term visit- silly me.)  I enclose
 
a story on Marie Romero Cash's northern New Mexico churches
 
project that we funded printed in the airline magazine
 
VistasWest;  c.f.  the paperclip.  It also included so many
 
regional folklifish stories that  I brought the whole thing
 
along fyi and toss.
 
I was met at the airport by Kathy Figgen who took me through
 
beautiful down-town Alamosa  (
one street wide)  to two local
 
cafes  (both closed)  until we finally hit a third local joint
 
where I got some green chile rellenos -- marvellous,  and I
 
was starved.  As Kathy drove me there,  talking alternately
 
about the wooden statue of a mythical bird by a young Chicano
 
sculptor that was going up in the elementary schoolyard,  and
 
the local legends about the snow-silvered mountain,  Blanca,
 
towering over us,  and the fact that the Alamosa community
 
college wants her to teach half time next year instead of 3/4
 
time,  and the failure of the local fire department to put out
 
the fire in Eppie Archuleta's daughter's house so that it
 
burned down completely after four visits by the firefighters,
 
and her own interest in
 a local Chilean ballerina who wants
 
to teach flamenco in the master-apprentice program,  I found
 
myself thinking -- this is exactly the same situation I saw
 
in American Samoa. No wonder things coming out of Colorado
 
have been so kind of peculiar.
 
It's a state -- at least the part I saw,  and conversations
 
with other arts people arriving later for the conference
 
sounded awfully similar except maybe for Denver -- consisting
 
of spread-out,  pretty long-standing,  stable,  local
 
populations -- in this case Hispanic,  in other areas,  Anglo
 
(
rancher/farmers)  or Indian -- overlain by more than a
 
scattering of interesting odd-ballers of a variety of talents
 
who have kind of wandered into the area and never moved on.
 
Many in both groups are practicing artists,  and I found
 
really interesting the degree to which they had formed
 
working cooperative arrangements,  in many cases via small
 
local arts agencies such as Adobe de Oro Concilio de Artes
 
(
the Alamosa LAA).
 
The meeting I was invited to was the annual meeting of the
 
Colorado Consortium of Community Arts Councils,  (director:
 
John J. Dandurand 303/623-1845,  a folky fellow but nice.
 
Almost all the people I talked with were friendly towards
 
folk arts,  complimented our three state folklorists for their
 
past help with many issues and in general provided a pleasant
 
antidote to my experiences at NALAA and NASAA meetings.
 
Admittedly,  the theme of the convention was something about
 
heritage  (
I've lost the exact wording)  but the general rep of
 
folk arts appears to be truly high.
 
The overall program certainly emphasized the traditional
 
arts;  see attached program that I highlighted.  The evening in
 
San Luis  (
9/12)  preceded the formal meeting and was a stand-
out.  San Luis is a small village with a progressive priest,
 
Father Pat Valdez,  who has persuaded,  negotiated and probably
 
battered the community into making art their basic concern.
 
They have a visitors center,  a series of spectacular murals
 
on the church and other buildings,  an old convent turned into
 
a bed and breakfast place on the top floor and a small art
 
museum plus gift shop for local crafts on the bottom,five or
 
six working craftsmens studios on the main street you can
 
wander into and a really quite spectacular Stations of the
 
Cross,  a series of half life size bronze statues by a local
 
Hispanic sculptor set into a pathway that climbs a gentle
 
mesa just outside the town and wanders around so that at
 
every statue you see a different breathtaking view of the
 
surrounding mountains.  The Stations of the Cross is already
 
attracting 500 visitors a day during weekends,  divided
 
between art lovers and religious,  and I have no doubt at all
 
it will become a major landmark for visitors.  They do not
 
apparently envision building a hotel;  they hope people will
 
just stop by.
 
We had dinner there at the Parish Hall and were entertained
 
afterwards by Semillas de la Tierra dancers,  a local 20 year
  
old  
folklorico.  They headquarter at Adams State College,  use
 
taped music except for one major performance per year when
 
they hire in a mariachi from Mexico,  and pride themselves on
 
the fact that their director  (
lost his name - Kathy Figgen
 
knows)  goes to Mexico once or twice a year to learn new
 
dances and check out the "authenticity" of their costumes and
 
steps.  There were six dancers,  and I have to say I was very
 
taken with how really well they did,  (
but remember I am no
 
expert here - just usually not taken by such performances)
 
They seemed to me well trained,  dedicated,  enthusiastic and
 
absolutely loving what they were doing.
 
Unfortunately I was sitting kind of off to the side and
 
behind and the announcer used no mike,  so I am not at all
 
sure if any of the notes I jotted down on the accompanying
 
program  (
see the organge An Evening in San Luis)  are the
 
least bit accurate.
 They did two sets of dances wearing two
 
different sets of home-made costumes:  the first from Puebla I
 
think  (
Danza de los Negritos? Danzas de los Gonzales? de los
 
Huahuas?)  and the second from Nuevo Leon  (
Chino Bravo?,
 
Pavido Navijo? Luji - the Crane?,  Teresito? Circo?).  I spoke
 
with two of the women dancers  (
one Irish,  the other two
 
Chicana)  while they were changing and complaining bitterly
 
about how hard it was to dance on a concrete floor.  I
 
promised to send them some information I received from Tap
 
America about a new portable flooring especially designed for
 
foot-sounding.(I' ve called Nikki Daval about this and will
 
send you the info also when she sends it to me.)
 
I also spoke with the lead male dancer/director Geronimo
 
(Jerry)  Olivas later,  suggesting the possibility that they
 
could find or train local musicians,  pointing out one reason
 
live musicians were in short supply was that their jobs were
 
being usurped by tape recorders.  He was interested and may
 
get in touch with you about the possibility of some help with
 
a musicians training program which is what he thinks they
 
need.  He says nobody around can play trumpet and one man
 
knows a little bit of accordion but not enough and everybody
 
needs to learn the right tunes.  Anyway it was a constructive
 
conversation,  and I think got him kind of excited about the
 
possibilities.  I suggested that local musicians might also
 
play for community dances and sort of revive some of the
 
older social life and he thought that would be great.  These
 
are awfully nice folks,  just not many of them and they do
 
have to improvise and double up.
 
Anyway the whole experience made me kind of re-evaluate my
 
negative feelings towards folkloricos;  this group seemed to
 
me in many ways analagous to the appearance at the next days
 
lunch of El Conjunto Nueve Axlan  (
sp?)  a group of 3
 
guitarist-singers plus a guitarron.  The leader is one Freddie
 
Jacques who is also the president of the Adobe D'Oro Arts
 
Council and a member of the Colorado State Arts Council,  a
 
real sweetie,  I thought,  and they sure did sound like home
 
when they sang.  They were singing to entertain just as the
 
folklorico was dancing to entertain; both groups were
 
striving to do what they did really well and with stylistic
 
accuracy;  the main difference of course was that the
 
folklorico was part-time dancing outside their own particular
 
tradition.  I still don't think we should flat out fund
 
folkloricos,  but perhaps we could help steer them;  they are
 
certainly a live force in that small town. Maybe my
 
improvisation of helping them focus on live musical
 
accompaniment could be a useful strategy that would fit in
 
with the general guidelines,  I don't really know.
 I wish you
 
guys who know more about it than I could have seen them.
 
I
 
The lunch I mentioned was a Matanza,  presented in a local
 
park,  cooked by the local arts council folks - cf the recipe
 
book I brought back for you to fight over -  and funded by
 
the Fund for Folk Culture!  I meant to ask Kathy if there was
 
more to the project than just feeding 150 people at a
 
conference but never got the chance.  It was indeed a lovely
 
affair,  the food was great,  the musica warm and real,  and
 
everybody had a wonderful time,  but it did seem like a kind
 
of limited thing to put grant money into.  Posssibly I missed
 
part of it.
 
Back at the meeting,  I attended the three folklorists'
 
presentations on Saturday.  Bea Roeder did a good job of a
 
very extensive slide show,  good photos,  well commented on.
 
Ronna Lee Sharpe had prepared a Masters/Apprentice notebook
 
that was given free to all attendees -- cf my packet.  I have
 
not read it word for word but upon sampling thought it was
 
good and suggest keeping it in the office to show people.  She
 
is mighty industrious and seems to act as the kingpin for the
 
trio.  Kathy gave a brief report mostly confessing a mistake
 
she had made by assuming that master/apprentice dyads could
 
be established in a single visit or by a couple of phone
 
calls.  She had thought when she left on vacation that ten
 
applications for apprenticeships would come in;  only one
 
actually showed and she was really crushed.  I thought it was
 
both brave and educational for her to talk about that problem
 
publicly.
 
Now for two items of really good news.  One:
 The Colorado
 
Arts Council has set up a Folk Arts Project Mini-Grants
 
category in which small organizations can apply on a first-
come,  first-served basis for small amounts of project support
 
up to $500.  They figure they can fund 18 or more each year,
 
and have kept the requirements very simple - a letter of
 
explanation of the project and a budget including some amount
 
of a matching contribution,  soft or hard. A panel committee
 
reviews the requests as they come in over the telephone.(See
 
the one page description in the Master Apprentice book)  V-e-
r-y interesting,  I think and a useful idea for others.
 
The second even more exciting.  I had a 2-3 hour meeting with
 
one Francis "Fabby" Hillyard,  Deputy Director of the Mayor's
 
Office of Art,  Culture and Film  (
280 14th Street,  Denver,  CO
 
80202
 303/640-2693).  She wanted to ask me if anybody had
 
ever set up a city folklorist position,  because she thought
 
Denver needed one.  I urged her onward.  She is a real find,  I
 
think,  would make an excellent lay panelist for somebody,  a
 
ranch-raised Coloradan,  very smart and nice and  down-home
 
when she puts that hat on.  I told her to get in touch with
 
the office and get started on just how other people have
 
handled city folklore programs,  mentioned LA,  Philadelphia,
 
and a few others.  If she doesn't call try her yourselves;  I
 
do believe this is a really talented woman;  she already knows
 
a lot.
 
A
 
i
f, 
A few side notes.*Pete Gomez was one of the local singing
 
trios;  his card bills him as Tequila Sunrise and says he
 
produces D J music for parties,  dances and receptions;  he
 
asked to be remembered to Dan whom he knows.*Bea Roeder
 
reported she met frequently with the Mexican organization in
 
Denver that has applied and been rejected twice for their
 
chili festival,  and when I spoke with the organizer  (
sorry,
 
can't find his name anywhere)  he said she had really tried to
 
be helpful. Not knowing why or even that they had been
 
rejected,  I couldn't be too helpful myself but I tried to
 
calm him down.  Later he said that on looking it over he
 
thought he had sent in a pretty poor application himself,  and
 
he would like sometime to come to Washington and talk the
 
whole thing over.I said good.  He will reapply for a third
 
time.anyway.*In my informal remarks I urged the audience
 to
 
improve the quality of their samples,  talked about the panel
 
as a pot luck supper and suggested they reapply and not get
 
discouraged.  *Finally,  the rosemaling artist told her session
 
that she had gotten rejected by the Colorado program the
 
first time she applied but somebody told her that if you
 
apply four times,  they have to give it to you,  so she just
 
advises everybody  
to keep on trying.
 
Now to Eppie.  I drove out to see her the first day,  and Kathy
 
and I bugged her by phone until she drove in to see the
 
Raices exhibition which includes two of her weavings.She had
 
said she was too tired and old and mean to enjoy it but she
 
had a really nice time,  it seemed to me.
 
Her situation is simultaneously bleak,  desperate,  confused,
 
positive,  maddening,  hopeful and unpredictable.  I do not have
 
the least idea what will happen next,  but E.  Archuleta will
 
eventually get a wool mill going unless she keels over dead
 
first,  and I do not have the least idea which.  She is living
 
in a trailer without running water and two broken windows;
 
her daughters and daughters in law leave all their small
 
children on her everyday to baby sit;  her sons and sons in
 
law can only work for her on
 weekends;  she has no money to
 
pay other labor;  her husband appears to me to have
 
Alzheimers;  she has committed to weave a special tapestry for
 
the Viet Nam womans war memorial for no money during the next
 
month,  (
a general came over while I was visiting to arrange
 
to fly her and a son on an air force bomber up to Washington
 
for the dedication at a cost he estimated at $6,000);  she
 
throws all her mail out unopened unless she thinks it has a
 
check in it so communication is almost impossible;  and she is
 
in debt either $75,000 or $125,000 to the Small Business
 
Association and the bank at something like 14% interest,
 
which both agencies want to renegotiate but they can't
 
because the business isn't up and going.  It's a real folk
 
scene.
 
I will not take you through all the harrowing details,  since
 
I am not at all sure I have them straight.
 However,  one
 
important story.
 Eppie's troubles began when she bought her
 
machinery several years ago and accepted a local friend's
 
offer to install her little factory  on his land at a very
 
modest rental.  The place was up and running and she had
 
orders. but when her picture came out in the National
 
Geographic,  the kind neighbor came to her and said that
 
anybody whose picture was in the N.G. must be a millionaire
 
and tripled her rent.  Eppie responded by moving out.
 
Now,  her machines are real old-fashioned machines - there are
 
several of them,  each about half a box car in size.  It cost
 
her some $5-10,000 just to move them,  and one piece
 
apparently fell off or something and had to be sent to New
 
Mexico to be re-sharpened,  costing $5,000 each way.  Each
 
machine had to be installed on a concrete flooring besides;
 
then the roof of the washing room fell in  and I won't go
 
into the rest of it.  As of now,  she has her factory  on her
 
own land,  bleak as it is,  she has her machines properly
 
installed,  the building is tight and sound and rather
 
impressive inside in terms of good basic carpentry,  but most
 
of the flooring is still dirt and winter is coming. One
 
grandson,  Chris Medina and his sister Dolores  (
Eppie's
 
daughter Norma's children)  have committed to keeping the wool
 
factory going.  Dolores is in New Mexico completing her
 
degree;  Chris,  whom I talked to,  is honchoing the job for his
 
grandma in between taking classes in business at Adams State
 
in Alamosa and catching jobs for spare cash where he can.  He
 
is a smart young man,  and I think means what he says.
 
I made two suggestions that might help:
 1
)  I suggested that
 
Kathy,  Chris and a Hispanic woman from the College that
 
everybody likes form a small Friends of Epppie Archuleta
 
committee that would meet every Friday morning at 9
:00 a.m.
 
for no longer than 15 minutes and just see where things
 
stand.  She has tax problems and insurance problems and cash
 
flow problems.  She is not a non-profit nor can she be until
 
she gets the factory going again when she could set asked an
 
educational part where she could teach  (
she already is),  so
 
there is nowhere to send any money if it can be raised.  But
 
things just don't get done because everybody rushes around
 
helping on their own discoordinated bats,  including Eppie.
 
2
)  I asked E if she knew the woman in northern N.M.  who
 
got the MacArthur award.  She said casually,"Sure,  she sent me
 
some wool to process a long time ago because she does all her
 
work by hand and she can't keep up with her orders and she
 
knows I do good work." I then suggested that she and Mario
 
Ewell or some other negotiator type go on a little journey to
 
visit this lady and see if they can persuade her to give
 
Eppie a contract;  they got $400,000 from MacArthur and the R.
 
Redfield foundation sends them a yearly stipend,  (
the
 
Millagro Beanfield Fund)  so maybe they can spare some to help
 
Eppie get underway.

7olklorist's Quarterly Report
 
3t 15 - November 30,  1993
 
Bea Roeder
 
a period of reorganization and adjustment
 
L
on.
 I am delighted to be at Pikes Peak
 
i
cy McCollum has been most supportive and
 
i
ve me a very light teaching load this
 
r
en me time to plan for next semester's
 
)
re"  class and to learn the ropes.
 
i
s advisory committee,  which met in
 
)
ne expressed an interest in having guest
 
i
lklorist or by the  "folk"--those folk
 
artists or ethnic tradition-bearers who are knowledgeable about
 
some aspect of a particular course and can contribute their own
 
unique perspective as cultural  "insiders."  So far I have given
 
two lectures to geography classes,  and expect to speak to
 
sociology,  nursing,  and philosophy classes next semester.
 
In November I taught a series of three workshops on folk
 
medicine,  with a Sioux guest speaker one week and a Mexican
 
American curandera the next.
 It was a modest beginning;  we had
 
only nine students,  but other workshops in the series had been
 
cancelled for lack of interest.
 The series will be offered again
 
next semester.
 
I have agreed to work with Nancy on an exhibit of multi-cultural
 
traditional textiles from Colorado.
 The exhibit will be next
 
September and October at the Downtown Studio.
 
Garden of the Gods:  The week of September 20th was Native
 
American Week at PPCC,  which counts over one hundred Native
 
Americans among its students.
 A chance comment by a Southern Ute
 
speaker,  Dorothy Naranjo,  about lack of access to the Garden of
 
the Gods,  led me to check with Gene Smith,  head interpreter for
 
several city parks,  including the Garden of the Gods.
 The Garden
 
of the Gods is currently developing a new (the second) Master
 
Plan and making a real effort to get input from all interested
 
parties,  including the Lone Feather Council  (which used to have
 
its annual powwow and encampment at the Garden of the Gods until
 
the City kicked them out some time ago).
 
Gene is seeking Ute help in interpreting the history of the park,
 
for it is known that the Utes came to the springs in Manitou,
 
which they considered sacred,  and wintered in the Garden of the
 
Gods area.
 However,  he did not know whom to contact.
 Dorothy
 
put me in touch with Alden Naranjo,  the Southern Ute tribal
 
historian,  who is willing and even eager to work with Gene.
 A
 
meeting is planned for January;  Gene has asked me to serve as a
 
[volunteer]  consultant on the project.
 
Complications arose mid-November when a woman named Irene Fire
 
Dancer called Gene,  claiming to represent Native American

This quarter has been a period of reorganization and adjustment
 
to a new base institution.
 I am delighted to be at Pikes Peak
 
Community College.
 Nancy McCollum has been most supportive and
 
helpful.
 She wisely gave me a very light teaching load this
 
semester,  which has given me time to plan for next semester's
 
"Introduction to Folklore"  class and to learn the ropes.
 
PPCC:  We formed a campus advisory committee,  which met in
 
October.
 Nearly everyone expressed an interest in having guest
 
presentations by the folklorist or by the  "folk"--those folk
 
artists or ethnic tradition-bearers who are knowledgeable about
 
some aspect of a particular course and can contribute their own
 
unique perspective as cultural  "insiders."  So far I have given
 
two lectures to geography classes,  and expect to speak to
 
sociology,  nursing,  and philosophy classes next semester.
 
In November I taught a series of three workshops on folk
 
medicine,  with a Sioux guest speaker one week and a Mexican
 
American curandera the next.
 It was a modest beginning;  we had
 
only nine students,  but other workshops in the series had been
 
cancelled for lack of interest.
 The series will be offered again
 
next semester.
 
I have agreed to work with Nancy on an exhibit of multi-cultural
 
traditional textiles from Colorado.
 The exhibit will be next
 
September and October at the Downtown Studio.
 
Garden of the Gods:  The week of September 20th was Native
 
American Week at PPCC,  which counts over one hundred Native
 
Americans among its students.
 A chance comment by a Southern Ute
 
speaker,  Dorothy Naranjo,  about lack of access to the Garden of
 
the Gods,  led me to check with Gene Smith,  head interpreter for
 
several city parks,  including the Garden of the Gods.
 The Garden
 
of the Gods is currently developing a new  (the second) Master
 
Plan and making a real effort to get input from all interested
 
parties,  including the Lone Feather Council  (which used to have
 
its annual powwow and encampment at the Garden of the Gods until

historian,  who is willing and even eager to work with Gene.
 A
 
meeting is planned for January;  Gene has asked me to serve as a
 
[volunteer]  consultant on the project.
 
Complications arose mid-November when a woman named Irene Fire
 
Dancer called Gene,  claiming to represent Native American
 
interests and particularly the  "Rainbow Tribe"  (probably as New
 
Age as it sounds).
 She attended one meeting,  made some specific
 
demands and called the press to announce a demonstration against
 
the Garden of the Gods.
 The City is now faced with a new issue,
 
or perhaps two:  how to determine who truly represents Native
 
Americans,  and how to deal with demands for religious use of a
 
public park.
 An inter-denominational Easter Sunrise service has
 
long been held in the Garden of the Gods.
 Will a predominantly
 
conservative city with a strong fundamentalist sector allow
 
Native American sacred ceremonies to be held there?
 If so,  will
 
it also allow New Age nativistic and possibly Wicca rituals?
 
(Manitou is home to at least one Wicca coven.)
 Gene Smith,
 
Eugene RedHawk  (of the local  Indian Council),  and I have spent
 
several hours discussing how best to include representatives of
 
tribes known to have occupied this area and how to deal with
 
individuals who seem either fraudulent in their claims or more
 
concerned with getting publicity for themselves than with
 
achieving the consensus which the Master Plan seeks.
 How ironic
 
that a traditional Native American value--consensus--seems to be
 
being attacked by persons purporting to represent Native
 
Americans!
 
CCA:
 
Master/Apprentice Folk Arts Program.
 Most of my time during
 
August and September went to encouraging likely traditional
 
artists to apply for the M/A grant and consulting with artists
 
who applied on their own.
 Six of the eleven grants awarded went
 
to Eastern Colorado folk artists.
 
Public Presentations:
 on August 26 and 27  I gave presentations
 
in the CEH  "Columbus:  Myth and Reality" program at the Fort
 
Morgan Museum/Library and the Brush Senior Citizen's Center.
 I
 
had started taking slides of Chicano murals in the 1960's,  so for
 
this presentation I pulled together a history of Mexico and the
 
American Southwest as portrayed by Chicano muralists.
 Lorenzo
 
Trujillo and his son and niece also came to Fort Morgan to
 
present Spanish colonial music,  so the small audience got quite a
 
treat.
 Maggie Stephens,  Education Director of the Museum,
 
arranged for me to meet with a local Hispanic quilting family,
 
who showed me their quilts and enthusiastically described how
 
they used to make mattresses,  stuffing them with wool from their
 
own sheep,  and how they had to be untied and washed once a year.
 
In September all three of us gave presentations at the CCCAC
 
annual meeting (see below).
 In October I also spoke to museum
 
professionals at the Mountains and Plains Museum conference in
 
Colorado Springs.
 Their keynote speaker was Rayna Green,  a
 
Native American folklorist who spoke of her work with the
 
Smithsonian and its new Museum of the American Indian.
 
Archiving/data entry:  The three slide presentations mentioned
 
above helped force me to organize my slide and photo collection.
 
As a result,  I have now entered about half of my photos in a
 
Paradox data base.
 When Carolyn Kallomyn called to ask for a
 
photo of a folk artist for the State of the Arts,  I could
 
actually locate it!
 I am still learning how to link files and
 
design queries to access information more efficiently;  in fact,
 
I
've spent about a week in November struggling to understand and
 
achieve "referential integrity" among a number of files.
 The
 
process is slow, but each time I get a request for information,  I
 
work out a few more kinks.
 Next year,  I hope to develop a report
 
that will automatically call up and display all information I
 
have relevant to a given folk artist: address,  etc.,  folk arts
 
grants applied for and received,  any photos, audio or videotapes,
 
articles about them,  etc.
 The difficulties are two-fold:  first,
 
designing tables and other forms that will do the job; and
 
second, getting all the data entered.
 Next semester a PPCC
 
computer lab person will be helping me one hour a week.
 
CCCAC: The Consortium meetings in Alamosa with keynote speaker
 
and past director of the NEA Folk Arts Program,  Bess Lomax Hawes,
 
was instructive and fruitful.
 It is always helpful to gather
 
with so many hard-working and creative local arts council
 
members.
 John Danderand's choice of the traditional arts as the
 
theme for the meeting was most gratifying.
 Bess was a wonderful
 
keynote speaker and a very helpful mentor to her folklorist
 
"children."
 I believe we three folklorists all got guidance for
 
some specific problems  (such as how best to begin presenting
 
folklore and the folk arts in the public schools),  some gentle
 
criticism and a large measure of inspiration.
 
KUVO: Frank White of KUVO has asked me to be a scholar for a
 
program he is planning in late December and January 1st on "Los
 
Dias," a tradition he remembers from the San Luis Valley.
 
Spanish and Mexican custom is to serenade people on their Saint's
 
Day (rather than celebrating a birthday).
 One nice feature of
 
this custom is that everybody has access to a calendar listing
 
saints' days,  so one doesn't have to remember individual's
 
birthdates.
 The saint's day for men named Manuel  (or women named
 
Manuela)  is January 1st,  so it doubles as a New Year's greeting.
 
Musicians gather before dawn and go around to the houses of
 
people named Manuel,  improvising verses  (according to an
 
established formula) to celebrate their birthday and their
 
contributions to the community (or roast their pecadillos).
 
Frank has been -denied NEA grants because he,  like many minority
 
activists,  resists involving a scholar in his work.
 He does not
 
even trust Chicano scholars--he perceives them as having been too
 
acculturated or having had to conform too closely to "the system"
 
in order to get their degrees.
 At any rate,  he made it clear
 
that he was inviting me to serve on his committee in order to get
 
a CEH grant, and made a point of introducing Brenda Romero, a
 
Boulder ethnomusicologist,  and myself as "academic scholars," as
 
opposed to the "real scholar," a musician whom folklorists would
 
term a "community scholar"--untrained academically but with a
 
solid knowledge of the culture and a passion for studying it.
 
Pikes Peak Arts Council
 I joined the Pikes Peak Arts Council,
 
which means that I meet with local arts organizations one day a
 
month.
 It is an opportunity to do a little networking;  so far,
 
either I
've learned something helpful or I
've been able to help
 
someone else at every meeting.
 The Council President surprised
 
me by enrolling in my Folk Medicine workshop!
 
The American Folklore Society Annual Meeting was held October 28-
30,  1993.
 These meetings are powerful stimulants to tired and
 
isolated folklorists from all over the country.
 To mix with over
 
300 active folklorists was in itself a refreshing contrast to the
 
usual reaction:  "You're a what?
 What does a folklorist do?"
 
The conference offered a multitude of answers in 116 paper
 
sessions  (in most of which five speakers presented five different
 
answers),  17 video sessions,  33 panels,  a dozen fora  (forums?),
 
two workshops,  a Native American performance event,  and two major
 
addresses.
 The conference enables us to refresh our memories of
 
academic history and theory;  keep abreast of public sector
 
issues,  developments in our fields,  and what our colleagues are
 
doing;  survey a roomful of folklore publications and buy a few
 
with conference discounts;  and make contact with granting
 
agencies.
 In the latter category,  for example,  I received
 
substantial encouragement to proceed with the idea of presenting
 
a bi-state conference on traditional Hispanic Music of New Mexico
 
and Colorado.
 
I attended sessions ranging from copyright and royalty issues in
 
folklore archives and recordings to folk medicine.
 If you think
 
Council meetings are long now,  consider the precedent of the
 
Iroquois  (whose five-nation confederation is the source,  almost
 
word for word,  of our United States Constitution).
 Iroquois
 
leaders were not content with a mere majority vote;  they
 
continued discussions until a consensus was reached!
 
Elaine Eff,  who was the City Folklorist for Baltimore,  suggested
 
that a city  (or state)  folklorist needs a mandate to study folk
 
life,  not just folk arts,  in order to include such topics as
 
occupational folklore and how urban development affects old
 
neighborhoods.  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania,  may soon get a city
 
folklorist and Fresno,  California,  hired one as of November 1
,
 
1993.
 
I met several other folklorists who teach in community colleges
 
from Florida to New York to California.  Everyone seems to agree
 
that there is no good basic text to introduce students to
 
folklore.
 Should the state folklorists collaborate to write or
 
edit one for Colorado??
 Most amazingly,  I also learned of an
 
English professor at the Air Force Academy who is working on a
 
study of academy cadence counts--and how they are changing since
 
women cadets have been admitted.
 A brief phone conversation with
 
Major Campbell after the meetings  left me reeling under a load of
 
occupational jargon.  Colorado has been settled by peoples who
 
speak different languages and dialects--Cheyene,  Ute,  Spanish,
 
German,  Ukrainian,  Chinese,  Hmong,  etc.
 As if it weren't
 
A
  
5
 
difficult enough to communicate with people who speak different
 
languages, English itself branches into a number of occupational
 
jargons that quickly establish who is an "insider" and who is
 
left out,  from cowboy, miner,  computer whiz, doctor,  lawyer,  or
 
military person to arts administrator.
 
Folklore in Education:
 I
've spoken with Patricio Cordoba,  of
 
Denver's Multi-Cultural Coalition,  attended and spoken at Mary
 
Mashburn's Multi-Cultural Workshop for teachers,  gotten some
 
ideas from Bess Lomax Hawes,  and attended a number of meetings of
 
the Folklore In Education Section at the American Folklore
 
Society meetings in Eugene.
 I
've been collecting sample
 
materials for teachers and generally preparing to gear next
 
semester's "
Introduction to Folklore" class to teachers in the
 
Pikes Peak Region.
 
Song of the Plains: Pat Mendoza culminated two years of oral
 
history research into the Sand Creek Massacre with a book, Song
 
of Sorrow,  and "Song of the Plains: A Colorado Folk Opera," which
 
premiered in November at the Arvada Center.
 He was kind enough
 
to acknowledge me in both the program and his book:  "And special
 
thanks Bea Rader [
sic],  Ph.D.,  Colorado folklorist
 
extraordinaire....  for introducing me to Neva Standing Bear
 
Light-in-the-Lodge and to Connie Buffalo for the last chapter of
 
this book."
 The "folk opera" drew nearly a full house.
 Angel
 
Vigil directed the performance and played a stern Spanish
 
conquistador; Calvin Standing Bear did a fine job of flute-
playing; members of the Colorado Chorale and Lynn Skinner
 
performed well in diverse roles,  and magician Autumn Morning Star
 
played a dignified Cheyenne woman who ended the performance by
 
drawing a dove of peace out of nowhere.  And to think that only
 
three months earlier I had told an opera singer who wanted to
 
apply for a Master/Apprentice grant that I didn't know of a folk
 
opera tradition in Colorado!
 
Mini -Grants: One went to the Lone Feather Indian Council of
 
Colorado Springs for their annual powwow last summer, to help
 
them with the move they wanted to make from Calhan fairgrounds to
 
the more expensive Penrose Stadium in Colorado Springs.
 Another
 
went to the Crook Historical Society to bring in cowboy poets for
 
their big annual event.
 Jan Johnson outdid herself documenting
 
their use of these funds.
 My only regret is that I was in
 
Alamosa for the Consortium and missed the Crook event, which drew
 
large and appreciative crowds.
 
Ten-month contract: Just a reminder that,  since I am now on a
 
ten-month contract, December and June are my months off this
 
year.
 I will be available again on Jan.  2
,  1994.
 In the
 
meantime,  Dave and I are going to Yucatan.
 He has an inter-
national math meeting in Merida; the next week I will attend the
 
Seventh Annual International Congress on Traditional Medicine.

Concerning my trip to Montgomery,  Alabama and Alamosa,
 
Colorado September 14-19,  I was actually working for two
 
different agencies:  the Alabama Center for Traditional
 
Culture and the Folk Arts Program at the National Endowment
 
for the Arts(administered through the National Council for
 
the Traditional Arts).Since I stayed with Hank Willett
 
overnight in Montgomery,  and my hotel bills including most of
 
my meals and local transport in Alamosa were picked up by the
 
Colorado Council on the Arts,  the only chargable costs are my
 
air fare,  the occasional meal tab and taxis to and from home
 
to the National Airport  (
$11.00 each way).
 
I bought two air tickets;  the round trip from Denver to
 
Alamosa  (
$194.60)  is clearly the Folk Arts Program's.  I
 
propose that the other one be simply divided down the middle;
 
my travel agent got me a tremendous value  (
$354.11 round
 
trip)  from DC to Montgomery to Denver back home)  so I believe
 
this will not be too costly for either party. Here is my
 
suggestion:

Concerning my trip to Montgomery,  Alabama and Alamosa,
 
Colorado September 14-19,  I was actually working for two
 
different agencies:  the Alabama Center for Traditional
 
Culture and the Folk Arts Program at the National Endowment
 
for the Arts(administered through the National Council for
 
the Traditional Arts).Since I stayed with Hank Willett
 
overnight in Montgomery,  and my hotel bills including most of
 
my meals and local transport in Alamosa were picked up by the
 
Colorado Council on the Arts,  the only chargable costs are my
 
air fare,  the occasional meal tab and taxis to and from home
 
to the National Airport  (
$11.00 each way).
 
I bought two air tickets;  the round trip from Denver to
 
Alamosa  (
$194.60)  is clearly the Folk Arts Program's.  I
 
propose that the other one be simply divided down the middle;
 
my travel agent got me a tremendous value  (
$354.11 round
 
trip)  from DC to Montgomery to Denver back home)  so I believe
 
this will not be too costly for either party.  Here is my
 
suggestion:
 
COSTS OF SITE VISIT TO COLORADO  (
9/16-19)
 NCTA/FA
 
Taxi to airport
 11.00
 
Shared airfare round trip DC-Denver-DC
 177.00
 
Airfare round trip Denver-Alamosa
 194.60
 
Miscellaneous meals
 27.00
  
409.60
 $410?

Shared airfare round trip DC-Denver-DC
 
Miscellaneous meals
 
11.00
 
177.00
 
29.00 
217.00
 
I enclose copies of airline tickets and a Colorado trip
 
report for NCTA.  If the above isn't clear or contains any
 
errors,  please get in touch.

Dear Bess:
 
It was very good seeing you here in Alabama,  however brief the visit.
 
I hope the rest of your journey was pleasant.
 
I meant to be more specific about the procedure for your collecting
 
reimbursement for your expenses.
 All we need is a signed statement itemizing
 
your expenses and a copy of your airline receipt.
 If your airline receipt
 
is complicated by the fact you traveled on to another destination,  just indicate,
 
on your statement, what part of your total airline expense you feel should be
 
credited to your Alabama trip expenses.
 Our reimbursements are typically made
 
rather quickly.
 
I'll miss you at AFS,  though I' m sure the Ethnomusicology meeting will be
 
lots of fun.
 You'll probably run into Jim and Erin in Oxford.
 
I may be coming up to Washington for an Expansion Arts Panel later in the
 
year.
 Perhaps we can get together then.
 Or,  if perchance I' m elected to the
 
AFS Board,  I suppose I'll be making more regular trips to Washington.
 
Thanks again for all your sage advice,  thoughtful encouragement and warm
 
friendship.
 
All best,
 
HW/jse
 
Hank

And t

 w

Thinking t

 d

You k
now,
 
when I

And s

A

 t
.
 
So when t
he National Endowment f
or t
he A
rts, a g
rant-giving
 
agency, o
ffered me a j
ob a
t t
he end o
f t
he f

t
s
 
p
rogram t
o i

hose a

o small g

w
ithin t
he United S

 was r
eady t
o t
ry i
t
. I
 a
lready had s
ome
 
i
deas and I
 was a
lso t
otally convinced t
hat t
his
 -
was-
--a,
-t
ruly-t.-�+
 
constructive e
ffort. I
 r
emembered hearing t
he anthropologist Edmund
 
Carpenter r
emark t
hat one o
f t
he i
mportant f
unctions
 
anthropologists had undertaken way back i
n t
he beginnings o
f t
he
 
d
iscipline was t
o search f
or t
hose f
actors t
hat were essential t
o t
he
 
p
reservation o
f t
he human species.  This t
ook t
he f
orm o
f a
ttempting
 
t
o d
iscover universals -
- what f
eatures o
f  behavior were p
resent i
n
 
a
l
l g
roups -
- and he said, much t
o everyone's s
urprise, one o
f t
he
 
r
e
latively f
ew t
rue  u
niversals t
urned out t
o be a
rt.  Absolutely no
 
people -
 not t
he Eskimos, not t
he Australian aborigines, n
ot t
he most
 
environmentally p
ressured h
uman berings we k
now o
f -
- n
one o
f
 
t
hem l
ack a

- t
o t
he

So I
 f
elt t
h
is was r
eally t
he p
lace f
or me.  Here I
 could set u
p
 
s
hop i
n an activist agency established b
y  Congress t
o encourage t
he
 
p
roduction and d
istribution o
f a
rt, which I
 had g
rown t
o r
espect a
s a
 
powerful s
chematic o
f t
he v
ital s
tructure o
f a culture.  And t
hen  I
 
f
ound i
n t
he Endowment's m
ission s
tatement t
he f
ollowing l
anguage:
 
"
This nation's governance i
s based on our people's
 
commitment t
o f

f i
magination, t
hought and e
xpression.  Our
 
many aesthef '
c and cultural t

- f
or t
he
 
r
i
ch variety o t
heir beauty and as a s
ymbol o
f t
he d
iverse nature o
f
 
t
he United S

You had multi-culturalism written r
ight i
nto t
he f
undamental
 
s
tatement o
f t
he agency's purpose, even i
f t
hey called i
t d
iversity
 
t
hen. Such l
anguage doesn't appear r
egularly i
n American l
aw; only
 
twice before i

id we ever g

t
he establishment o
f what was t
hen called t
he A

f American
 
Folk Song a
t t
he L

f Congress.
 
So t
here weren't many models t
o go b
y i
n t
h
is new activity.
 
But I
 wasn't l
acking f
or good advice.  F
rom t
he very f
