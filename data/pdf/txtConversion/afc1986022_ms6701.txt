and ah everybody was after it; then another ah person was brought into the picture. He
was seen you know off and on in the picture to make his presence known. Then ah later
in the movie he came out more. And all three of them were after the gold. Then ah the two
fellows who were pardners and in this ah scheme they had going ah ended up killing the
fellow at the end. Ah, it was like a circle. They had a circle and everybody was suppose
to draw on everybody and ah this other fellow the one that was a marksman he gave ah
his friend supposedly a gun which wasn't loaded so therefore he wouldnt have to draw
against but one man and that was the one in front of him and then when the other fellow
found after it was over and he found out about it he you know, he was kind of mad, then
the fellow put him up on top of this cross with his gold and set the two bags of gold right in
front of him, and had a rope on his neck so if he moved he would hang himself and after
he ah this fellow, he was riding off and he stopped bout a hundred yards or so, then he ah
shot the rope and that was thepicture. He just rode on off and the music dramatized the
picture all the way through. I think this is what sold the picture because the music helped it
a lot.
WF <unintelligible text>
INF The latest ah ...A Stranger In Town.
WF <unintelligible text>
INF Well ah, it was on the same principle, it was just a follow up, a poor one at that though.

there, I guess

INF they were tring to put a new character in it. He just didn't work out. He didn't he
seemed more like ah ah Doctor Doolittle type. And they had him playing a role like that.
And you just didn't get anything out of it because he didn't he didn't even appeal. So
therefore, you didn't pay too much attention to the movie cause I took somebody else to
see it cause they wanted to see it. I dozed off cause I didn't dig it.
WF <unintelligible text>
INF No, no. That was before m time.
WF <unintelligible text>

just walked on off. My father he had bought a boxer and after you pay all that money for
that he just, you know, that was his favorite....a thoroughbread boxer. So the other dog, we
just neglected and th whole family wanted this dog, but my father didn't like it ah the dog,
for some reason, he just walked on off one day and nver came back.

INF Well, When I was in school, I drew a lot because ah that's one thing I liked and ah
but the lady who kept us after school, she was an artist, and she had some ah pictures on
exhibition down at the Washington Gallery, pictures down on exhibition down there and ah
well we had nothing to do all day till our mothers got home. <gap> sit up there and draw all
day, so after while you know, you just caught on and ah in school, they would take me out
of class to ah draw something for school or something like that. So from ah elementary to
junior high school this is all mostly what I did you know what I mean
<unintelligible text>
INF because I bad an art teacher who ah had me draw background for the school plays
and stuff like this and take me home and we'd go back and work on school plays and stuff
like that. And I you know me and him would just work close together on art... this is what I
did all day longand they'd get me out of class and everything
WF <unintelligible text>
INF Well ah, it's all always related to art but mechanical drawing. I had a free hand in that
too because ah when to ah Western Junior High, I ah was in this class and ah they said
mechanical drawing and the last work, hit me, drawing, so I went in there and ah and the
teacher said ah well he said he said he liked the way I did it. He said ah.......this is all I did
the whole time. While Everybody else was working on sheet metal, something like that he
said he just wanted me to draw I wouldn't <unintelligible text> him, stuff like this.

INF Well, there wasn't too much to do after school unless you played ball or something
like that you know. Without any money, you couldn't do too much so ah we played ball and
went to ah parties occasionally. Ah,

shewas crazy.
WF <unintelligible text>
INF Ah, youknow how boys are, mischief and everything and we got into a whole lot of
trouble and she would holler, I don't know why you'd have <gap> and you know she would
holler and everything. Once they get old, you realize how people are....essentric.
WF <unintelligible text>
INF Well, quite a few. Some of em, they try to help you, this was I appreciated you know
when you really didn't really care too much about the class therefore you didn't try to do
too much in it. They
<unintelligible text> p.6
INF would try, you know, to keep your interest going in it . Then once you started
understanding the things <unintelligible text> more , you would , ah, be able to appreciate
it more; therefore, your interest would begin and you'd try to achieve something in it. But
ah, if the teacher was dull, then the subject was dull and you didn't get anything out of
