Coquille 
 
Watching the traditional canoe  
 
Like a sheep horn, brown and rustic, the canoe pitches to one side — takes water.  
With an exterior of finality, imaginatively halved, the cedar is quite old. 
Half similar or half alien is a decision. 
 
The curl of the paddle motions on one side and its reverse. 
North and southern contrasts sea faring parallels of the 
equator, akin to our navel above gender, reminiscent of central connections.   
 
A tree crest points to venerable lineage. 
One must accept oscillating internal realms, the tinder of fusion, 
kissing blossoms of recognition. 
 
Light and synthesis is sustenance and growth by these terms. 
What of weighted limbs of the hanged? 
The orphaned children met from a momentous crux of fortune changing hands. 
 
A vigilant helix bends into tomorrow. 
Eastern rise of simple trill funnels into the high idioms of justice. 
There are survivors who know ropes of ideology — the carnage. 
 
Truly wild geese call out a black series of condolences. 
Cadence of connection and rote of mutual landing  
patterned to triangles gathering and deltas. 
 
The geese travel the points between testing each moment. 
Antiquity finds its anchor in turmoil. This is the forfeiture,  
solace, soft compassionate wetlands in the clarity of receding drifts. 
 
It is the rain that mixes into heap of leaves a disciplined humid scent. 
Shimmer of rippling bay reaches for the bow of simple resurgence. 
Brown symbolic float Affinity and certain terms of reparation.
