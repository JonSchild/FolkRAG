Railroader
RAILROADER 5131 A1
Russ Pike Visalia, 1941
A railroader, a railroader A railroader for me If ever I marry in this wide world A railroader's
bride I'll be.
Now I would not marry a blacksmith For he's always in the black I'd rather marry an
engineer That throws the throttle back.
A railroader, a railroader A railroader for me If ever I marry in this wide world A railroader's
bride I'll be.
I would not marry a farmer He's always in the dirt I'd rather marry an engineer That wears
a striped shirt.
A railroader, a railroader A railroader for me If ever I marry in this wide world A railroader's
bride I'll be.
