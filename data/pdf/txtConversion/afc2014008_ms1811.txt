 She did not say where the film was
 
to be had, and I have written to her in vain, asking for a mo'e

 I do not know quite what information is a

but ikxxx I would like it better if you could have introduced me
 
to this fascinating rhythmic child-rearing tradition without
 
depreciating my own, which is not such a poor thing that I don't
 
value it.
 You hurt my feelings referring to "Go in and out the
 
windows" as an old chestnut.
 It was the first tune of which I
 
ever made a conscious aesthetic judgment.
 When I was introduced
 
to it on the graveled playground in Lincoln, Nebraska--and very
 
probably it was hot, though that I couldn't say--I thought,  "This
 
is lovely--this is beautiful music."  It can be dragged, but you
 
don't have to drag it.
 It's a matter of respecting the proper
 
pauses between lines and in the middle of the first three lines
 
I think.
 
I was grateful to learn at last what "balling the jack  c

I once knew a college song in which father, mother, and sister
 
id various disreputable things for a living,  "and the baby balls

 I miss one classification, though.
 No ring game
 
:cr toddlers.
 By toddlers I don't mean that the clothing manu-
acturers call toddlers, which is any child who still needs his
 
viothes cut to allow for diapers or training pants, which is a
 
ear or two after they have become graceful and agile walkers
 
r
id runners.
 Children just learning to walk love "Ring around
 
'he rosey," and I think of this as the youngest ring game.
 They
 
like to bump and they like to see whatever bigger person has
 
etarted the game fall down with them.
 It doesn't matter now,
 
ecause I am past the need of it, but there was a time when I
 
:
iould have been very glad to know another game for very young
 
:reschoolers.
 I got tired of falling down before they did.
 After
 
while I was able to add "here we go looby, looby" (little hand,
 
etc., instead of right and left), and that was a good exhausting
 
:
rling to end with; but it seemed to me that three was the right
 
umber, and none of the games I tried k in the middle slot seeme
 
exactly right.
 Even "Here we go round the mulberry bush" and
 
i
i
'he farmer in the c
iell" seem to be at least four-year-old gay
 
dl, it doesn't matter.

nine bottles of beer on the wall," which goes on and on monotonous.
 
on the same formula and gives the baby nothing to stay awake for.
 
I think the reason I did not use "Rockabye Baby," which I had know:
 
longest of all, is that it seems to call for actual rocking, and
 
just swayed the crib a bit.
 I think I rockabye d the baby in my

 which is from more ordinary
 
informants but represents the modern urban end of black children's
 
rhythms, there are a lot of snatches of tunes--bits from "Trar
ip,
 
tramp, tramp, the boys are marching" and "Yankee Doodle" and
 
"Shortnin' Bread" and "YO U  ought to see my Cindy" and "Sourwoc a
 
Mountain" that come to nothing as tunes because they are developed
 
rhythmically instead.
 There is an example in STEP IT DOWN.
 
"Rabbit and the Possum," p.  212, begins with the beginning of
 
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star," or "Ah vous dirai-je maman,
 
which I am told has a K number because Mozart played around
 
with it.
 It doesn't go on like "Twinkle, twinkle, little star,'
 
and though the development is a tune in its own right, it goes
 
with the snatches in CIRCLE ROUND THE ZERO.
 This tendency is
 
in marked contrast with the completed tunes in THE SINGING ST.

As Brian Sutton-Smith and Roger Abrahams have shown, although the singing game
 
has a
lmost vanished within the white child community, it is still active within the
 
Negro child tradition in urban as well as rural areas.  My own -
-
 and my students'
 
-
-
 observations in Los Angeles indicate that the same pattern i
s in effect on the
 
West Coast:
 that is, black children play singing games and white children, on the
 
whole, don't.  Further, it i
s clear that the repertoire of games played by Negro
 
children across the country is essentially the same -
-
 and remarkably stable.
 
However,  there i
s
 
more

When we were ready to start shooting, I made an attempt to organize the play
 
activity myself.
 It didn't work.  What you will be seeing therefore is quite
 
undirected, not because of any subtlety of field technique on my part, but because
 
the children simply wouldn't direct.  As has been said in another connection, they
 
came to play -
-
 and play is what they did for four solid hours.
 I had known their
 
tradition was important to them, but I had not known how important before.  We ran out
 
of film but they never ran out of enthusiasm.  While we reloaded, they enjoyed a
 
twentieth refreshing round of Punchinello 47 or My Mother Died; while we l
ooked f
or
 
faulty connections in our miles of wires, they joined into yet another ring.
 
There were lots of other things they could have done after all, there were
 
i
gle gyms and parallel bars and sandboxes onto which they would occasionally settle
 
r a few moments, but almost at once they would wheel and re-group, pushing and
 
:
)uting, for just one more taste of the delights of Pizza Pizza Daddy-U, their
 
i
-morning favorite.  One result, incidentally, was that I completely l
ost track of
 
what they were playing when we were shooting; and when the footage was developed I
 
that we had missed Little Sally Walker -

ow, because of t
ime l
imitations, rather than give you historical or comparative
 
a
La, I think it might be most helpful if I enumerated briefly the important elements
 
a
 y a female tradition; the little girls begin t
o
 
arn it during their 6th or 7th year.  By the time they reach puberty, the tradition
 
i
s abandoned -
-
 or perhaps simply transmuted into social dance.  From interviews
 
and casual observation, I have concluded that boys of the same age-span invariably
 
-3-
know the games but do not perform them in public situations such as the school
 
yard.
 In back yards and alleys however, the games are frequently p
layed by mi:ed
 
groups.
 
The primary game f
orm i
s the ring.  The clapping games in which two children
 
face each other and clap hands is actually itself a small ring to which others can
 
be added like a string of beads, or the group can dissolve into a l
arge single ring.
 
Other play forms consist of parallel lines facing each other; or one child f
acing
 
a row of children.  The only game that uses this l
atter f
ormation, by the way,
 
appears to be a recent adaptation,  into a p
lay f
orm, of a l
ocally popular hich schoni
 
f
ootball cheer.
 
l
l action takes p
lace inside the ring or between the parallel l
ines.
 
Characteristically, there is a central figure who initiates the action, and the
 
structure of each game consists of a series of moves which constitute one run-through
 
of the play.  This repetitive structure guarantees that there will he no more or l
ess
 
time f
or any child to have the central role.  Competition, then,  in the sense of
 
winning-losing, is completely absent.  Though individual p
layers may try to outdo
 
each other in improvisational detail, there is no reward expressed in terms of the
 
game action.
 
However, though players may improvise according to their own personal style,
 
they may not alter the fundamental structure of the play.  These are ,
essentially
 
ritualistic performances; as you will see, when one child forgets the correct order
 
t
ile  entire game breaks down.  The players, in spite of their attempts to cooperate
 
and greservo the leader's dignity, simply cannot continue.
 
Stylistically, the major feature is call and response; almost every phase i
s
 
echoed both in singing and movement patterns.  Motor expressiveness i
s e
laborated;
 
musical expressiveness is not.  Though the children clap, quite casually and without
 
apparent effort, in a three against four patters, their clapping style seems to stress
 
-4-
tactile rather than tonal value.
 Their hands are quite rela:ed;  they stroke instead
 
of making an impact.
 
The lyrics of the accompanying songs deal with down to earth situations and
 
use down to earth vocabulary.  Emotionally speaking, they are quite hot:  birth,
 
death, courtship, food, sex, illness, death are their subjects of choice.
 
Parenthetically, the emotional relevance of their play songs must contrast strangely
 
with the vanilla platitudes they find in their textbooks inside the s
chool
 
The last factor to which I want to draw your attention is the degree of body
 
empathy these children share.  They move over, make room, spread out, close together,
 
move in tandem and adjust to each other' physical presence in a thousand subtle ways.
 
Physically speaking, they enjoy group blend to a degree that white society only seems
 
to achieve under the strictest imposed discipline.  As I was standing admiring the
 
-i
utual concern they showed each other in both the structure and style of their play,
 
I asked a nearby teacher how they did in the classroom.
 "Oh, they're bright, a
ll
 
r
fght," she said.
 "What we always say is, we could teach them if we could just get
 
'
Her  to sit down

together as a group, what vital songs they sing."

As s
tudies b
y Brian S
utton Smith and Roger Abrahams have shown, a
lthough
 
t
he s
inging g
ame has a
lmost vanished w
ithin t
he Anglo-American community,
 
i
t i
s s
till active w
ithin the Afro-American child tradition i
n urban as
 
well as r
ural areas of t
he m
idwest, the east and t
he south.
 Observations
 
i
n Los Angeles i
ndicate t
hat the s
ame pattern i
s i
n effect on the west coast;
 
t
hat i
s, b
lack children p
lay s
inging games and white children, o
n the whole,
 
don't.
 Further,  i
t appears t
hat the r
epertoire of games p
layed by N
egro
 
children across t
he country i
s both h
ighly s
table and h
ighly dynamic; new
 
games (
usually r
e-workings or parodies of o
lder ones) appear and d
isappear,
 
b
ut t
heir essential s
tructure and s
tylistic characteristics continue to b
e
 
handed o
n from one generation of school children to the next.
 
The footage i
ncluded i
n t
his f
ilm was taken i
n December of 1
967
 on t
he p
lay-
ground o
f a school  i
n a Los Angeles b
lack ghetto.  The p
layers are a dozen
 
fourth grade g
irls (
9 to 1
0 years o
ld) whose well developed r
epertoire had
 
been earlier brought to my a
ttention by a sympathetic t
eacher.  They had been
 
prepared for t
he experience of f
ilming by being r
ecorded both by t
he teacher
 
and by me, and by a previous v
isit i
n which they had been  '
shot' w
ith an
 
unloaded camera to get them used to t
he new experience.
 
The actual f
ilm was t
aken i
n a p
layground area which had been r
eserved for
 
us for t
he morning so as to m
inimize t
he number of spectators.  We used two
 
1
6mm cameras, one i
n f
ixed position and one hand-held; sound was r
ecorded
 
v
ia an overhead boom m
ike.  The children had had t
he l
ocation of t
he m
ike
 
)
ointed out to t
hem and f
or the entire morning they centered themselves
 
i
thout d
irection under t
he m
ike w
ith a
lmost professional aplomb.  Actually,
 
t
hey r
eferred to the entire session as "the taping" and appeared to i
gnore
 
t
he cameras, except that t
hey t
ended to t
urn their b
acks o
n t
he hand held
 
camera when i
t came too c
lose.
 
A
ll action i
n the f
ilm was undirected, for  i
t t
urned out t
hat t
he children
 
needed no d
irection.  They had come to p
lay, and p
lay i
s what they d
id, whether
 
t
he cameras were l
oaded or not.  Further, t
hey p
layed what they wanted to p
lay,
 
and i
t turned out t
hat what t
hey wanted to p
lay was their own tradition of
 
s
inging games.  The parallel bars, s
and-boxes and so on i
n the p
lay yard
 
r
eceived t
he scantiest of a
ttention for the whole morning; occasionally they
 
would s
ettle onto t
he jungle gym for a few moments, but a
lmost at once they
 
would wheel and r
e-group, pushing and shouting, for just one more round of P
izza
 
P
izza Daddy-0, their current f
avorite.
 For this r
eason, and not because of
 
an especially sophisticated f
ield t
echnique on the part of the f
ilm-makers,
 
t
he organization o
f t
he g
ames s
hown i
s entirely t
he work of the c
hildren
 
t
hemselves.
 
-2-
Specific i
ncidents connected w
ith the i
ndividual games w
ill be d
iscussed
 
l
ater, but a few general observations as to the i
mportant s
tylistic and
 
s
tructural e
lements of this tradition m
ight be of help:
 
F
irst, this seems to be primarily a f
emale tradition; l
ittle g
irls begin
 
to l
earn i
t during their 6th or 7
th year.
 B
y the t
ime they r
each puberty
 
the tradition i
s abandoned, or perhaps s
imply transmuted i
nto social dance.
 
Boys of t
he same age-span seem i
nvariably to know the games but do not
 
perform them i
n public s
ituations such as the school yard.
 I
n b
ackyards
 
or a
lleys, however, the games may be p
layed by m
ixed groups.
 
The primary game form i
s the r
ing.  The c
lapping formation i
n which two
 
children f
ace each o
ther and c
lap hands i
s actually i
tself a small  r
ing to
 
which others can be added l
ike a s
tring of beads.  The o
ther principal p
lay
 
form consists of parallel  l
ines of p
layers f
acing each other.  A
ll action
 
t
akes p
lace i
nside the r
ing or between t
he parallel  l
ines; p
layers do not
 
go "outside".  Characteristically, t
here i
s a central f
igure who i
nitiates
 
the action, and the "plot l
ine" of each game then consists of a series of
 
moves which constitute one r
un-through of the p
lay; t
his i
s r
epeated until
 
the group i
s s
atisfied, or until everyone has had a t
urn at the center r
ole.
 
This s
tructure guarantees that t
here w
ill be no more or l
ess t
ime for any
 
child to have the central power position; competition, then,  i
n the sense
 
of w
inning-losing,  i
s absent.  Though i
ndividual p
layers may try to outdo
 
each other i
n i
mprovisational detail, there i
s no r
eward expressed i
n terms
 
of game action (
another turn a
t t
he central  r
ole, for example).
 
Stylistically the major f
eature i
s call and r
esponse; a
lmost every phrase
 
i
s echoed both i
n s
inging and movement patterns.  Motor expressiveness i
s
 
e
laborated; musical expressiveness i
s not.  Though t
he children c
lap, their
 
c
lapping s
tyle seems to s
tress t
actile r
ather than tonal values.  Their hands
 
are quite r
elaxed; t
hey s
troke i
nstead of making an i
mpact.  This effect i
s
 
emphasized by the degree of body empathy the children s
hare; they move over,
 
make room, spread out, c
lose together, move i
n tandem and adjust to each
 
o
ther's physical presence i
n a thousand subtle ways.
 Physically speaking,
 
they enjoy group b
lend to a degree t
hat white society only seems to achieve
 
under t
he s
trictest i
mposed d
iscipline.
 
I
t was deeply d
isturbing to d
iscover that these same children are a
lso expert
 
s
treet f
ighters.  Within their own c
ircle or between their parallel  l
ines they
 
demonstrated social tolerance and mutual support to a degree i
nconceivable
 
to those used to supervising white children's p
lay; apparently the h
igh social
 
empathy which so d
istinguishes their p
lay i
s somehow thwarted i
n l
ess formal
 
r
elationships, or perhaps by t
he s
tructure of "outside" i
nstitutions.
 
I
t i
s i
mportant to bear i
n m
ind that this tradition i
s a child-initiated and
 
child-directed activity; t
here i
s a m
inimum of adult i
ntervention,  i
f  i
ndeed
 
there i
s any at a
ll.  Most of t
hese childrens' teachers, for example, seemed
 
unaware of the fact that the children were p
laying these games, and those
 
who were aware of i
t had a tendency to d
isapprove.  Within this context, the
 
s
heer survival of these games becomes even more i
mpressive; some of them are
 
hundreds of years o
ld.  From the point of v
iew of demonstrating the antiquity
 
of this tradition,  i
t i
s particularly unfortunate t
hat technical problems
 
prevented the i
nclusion i
n the f
ilm of one of the most w
ide-spread and
 
h
istorically i
nteresting of their games:  "Little Sally Walker".  "Punchinello"
 
and "Head and Shoulders B
aby" a
lso had to be omitted from the f
inal version;
 
except for these three games, however, this f
ilm r
epresents t
he total  r
epertoire
 
of t
his particular group of g
irls.

Though considerations of space forbid any r
eal d
iscussion here of t
he
 
problem of cultural origins, t
his overall tradition appears to present
 
i
n a
lmost schematic form one of the principal ways i
n which European
 
and African e
lements have combined upon American soil.
 I
n terms of l
exical
 
content, over half these games are i
ndisputably British, the o
ther half
 
being most probably i
ndigenous to the United States.  Stylistically,
 
especially i
n terms of musical and k
inesic e
lements, t
hey seem equally
 
c
learly African, or at l
east Afro-American.
 F
inally, the total tradition
 
i
s a
t t
he t
ime o
f tni s  writing (
1969) t
he exclusive cultural property of
 
b
lack American children.

i
t i

s s
trikingly s
imilar to
 
many British nursery r
hymes.
 
I
t i
s worth pointing out especially that, a
lthough t
his song would b
e musi-
cally transcribed i
n a 4/4 or 2/4 meter, t
he children are quite casually
 
c
lapping i
n a 3
/4 r
hythm, a s
tyle of r
hythm p
lay which I have seen on other
 
b
lack p
laygrounds i
n the Los Angeles area.  This i
s considered t
echnically
 
d
ifficult by trained musicians, but apparently t
hese c
hildren haven't
 
l
earned that yet.
 
The child who thrusts herself i
nto the game i
s one of the unofficial  l
eaders
 
of the p
lay group, and this i
s perhaps why her aggressive behavior i
s so
 
r
eadily accepted by t
he other p
layers.  However,  i
t i
s s
till notable that
 
t
he children possess a traditional technique t
hrough which an outsider can
 
so easily be absorbed i
nto t
he original group.  Note, a
lso, how r
elaxed they
 
are about making r
oom for s
till additional p
layers.

By the t

had '
'drunk this'' and "drunk that", with an imaginary bottle t

 I believe this to be a r
e-working o
f a football cheer
 
popular i
n the Los Angeles h
igh schools a few years ago.  The
 
form of the game i
tself i
s quite unusual, suggesting a cheer
 
l
eader addressing a crowd, or a t
eacher talking to a c
lass.
 
The f
irst child l
eading t
his game had surprised me by asking formal permission
 
to be the l
eader; at no other t
ime was my opinion or s
anction sought.
 I
t then
 
emerged during p
lay that she d
id not know the l
ines of the r
hyme i
n t
he proper
 
order.  The f
irst child to point this out,  I d
iscovered l
ater, was the one
 
who had t
aught i
t to t
he r
est of the group; she successfully l
eads i
t for the
 
second r
un-through.  The child wearing t
he grey sweater was new to the school and
 
d
id not p
ick up the t
acit s
ignals by which the p
layers decided to support their
 
l
eader even though she was wrong.  Her i
ll-timed r
emark, "That's wrong" made
 
her t
he t
arget for the group's hostility; my own feeling i
s that t
he p
lay would
 
have broken down anyway, s
ince t
hese are ceremonies r
ather t
han g
ames and must
 
be done correctly.

their s
