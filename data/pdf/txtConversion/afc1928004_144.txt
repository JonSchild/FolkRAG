I 
am a 
jovial collier lad. 
As blithe as blithe can be, 
For let the times be good or bad, 
They're all the same to me ; 
'Tis lit- the of the world I 
know, 
And care hens f , r 
its Ivays, 
For where the dog-,star never glows, 
I 
wear away my days. 
cnonus. 
Down in a 
coal mine. underneath the grort ,d, 
Where a 
gleam of sunshine never can be found; 
Digging dusky diamonds all the season round, 
Down in a 
coal mine underneath the ground. 
My bands are horny, bard and black 
with working in the vein, 
And like tho clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough and plain ; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse in say, 
'Tis not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &c. 
At every shift, bet soon or late, 
I 
haste Inv bread to earn, 
And anxiously my kindred wait, 
And watch for my tel HUD : 
For death that levels all alike. 
Whate'er their rank may be, 
Amid tl,e fire and damp may strike 
And fling his darts at me. 
Down in a 
coal mine, & c. 
How little do the great ones care 
Wto sit at home secure. 
What hidden ean ers colliers dare— 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Ma yhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial colliers' lives. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &O. 
Then cheer up, lads, and make ye ranch 
Of every joy ye can. 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a 
man • 
Bowever fort nine turns about 
We'll sti I 
be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals.

Ain.—"Immensikoff. 
Ha, ha, my boys. aw, how do you do? 
Perhaps you don't know me, 
I'm Felix Brown when I'm iii town, 
I 
hang out at Union Square : 
There's not such another quarter— 
You'll not find anywhere, 
Such dashing swells mid handsome girls 
As you will meet with there. 
Union Square, Union Square, 
You'll not find anywhere, 
Such dashing swells and handsome girls 
As you will meet with there. 
Alt. when the season's in full swing, 
Now that's the time for me— 
Such howling swells and dashing bells 
You every night will see. 
Fond Mae, and Pas. so anxious, 
In glory they come Out. 
And lay such traps for its poor chaps, 
At a 
party, ball or rout. 
Union Square, &c. 
Wander where you will. my boys, 
No matter where you train 
You'll never see I'm certain, 
Another Harlem Lane, 
For where can you see such beauty, 
As you will meet with there. 
On a 
steppin'g horse, no ;), re or course, 
Amongst the fairest of the fair. 
Union Square, &e. 
So now, dear boys, I 
must he off, 
I've soinethin2; on to- night, 
There's Mrs -

And her I 
cannot slight, 
She's guardian to a 
charmer. 
Who has soine thou—s

To live near Union Square.

NO ONE TO DRINK—NO ONE TO SMOKE. 
Written and sung by BILLY Corrort. 
Ala.— :- Driven front Home." 
No one to drink—no one to smoke, 
Except an old bummer, or else an old moke; 
And if you get drunk. Volt must do it alone, 
For in your drowsiness you're as snug as a 
bone; 
No watchman's voice (or eott-liver oil) 
Makes you rejoice, or your cares beguile. 
No one to drink—no one to smoke. 
Except an old bummer, or else an old moke. 
No one to drink, &c. 
No one to dance with, or to theatre go. 
Except that old bun: who sticks to you so; 
A 
lid if you feel sick. and go there alone. 
You feel just as if you'd have sooner stayed home, 
No gentle voice, no loving smile, 
Make you rejoice, except you have a " pile." 
No gentle voice, ite. 
DRINKS TOO MUCH. 
As es:Ing by BILLY Corrox, with great success. 
Now, white folks, here's a 
song for you, 
it may be old an it may be new, 
But this I'll say with a 
right good will, 
I 
learnt it from black Uncle Bill. 
CHORUS. 
Then bear a 
hand for Jersey Bill, 
lie's dead in huh wid Nancy Gill ; 
She .

dark-eyed gal. but this I 
fear, 
She drinks too much good lager bier. 
Now Jersey Bill's a 
gallant nig,

WE'LL GO DOWN TO CUBA. 
As sung by BILLY Corrox, Ethiopian comedian. 
Oh! away down in Cuba, 
Dey've got a 
little muss, 
And I 
think we'd better go 
And settle up the fu s
s. 
Dey're fighting for deir freedom. 
Dey'll get it, mind what I 
say 
For Uncle Sam will help dew, 
Before a 
many days. 
Den come along, boys. don't you be afraid. 
We'll all go down to Cuba with -Uncle Sam's Brigade. 
Oh I 
when we arrive in Cuba, 
Won't dere be some fun. 
De ladies dey will cheer, and 
Welcome us, ebery one. 
With the Stars and Stripes a-flying, 
Dere yell take our stand. 
We'll gibe ole Spain de debil. 
And dribe her from de land. 
Den come along, &c. 
When de muss is settled, 
Coffee will be cheap. 
And we'll hal) all de oranges 
Pat all ob us can eat. 
Shtigar \ill be plenty. 
Enough for ebery man, 
For den tie Ile of Cuba 
Will belong to Uncle Sun. 
Den come along, &c. 
SHARESPERE'S DREAM, 
By T. M Sium.us. 
A IR:—" 
Wearing of the Green." 
A 
victim of Circumstances and a 
Bashful Irishman 
Were seen, one morning, to dance the French Can-Can; 
The Laucagbire Lass was seen a 
Taming of the Shrew, 
With Barney, the Baron, on her arm to help the matter throngh. 
TheGrand Duchess stoops to Conquer, tinder the Gaslight After Dark, 
wral Black-eyed Susan by her side : 0111 i,n't she a 
lark 7 
Shylock keeps in Chatham stre,t a 
Lager-Bier Saloon, 
Where Hamlet and the Orange Girl will spend their Honeymoon. 
The Ticket -
of Leave-Man's troubled, lest he'll be sent to Botany-Bay; 
iIts Waitin ; for the Verdict, and I 
think he'll sue Foul Play; 
The Ghost of Hamlet's Father was heard to raise a 
buzz; 
The Emerald Ring will glitter, when Ireland's as it was. 
The Man wi-th the Carpet-bag was seen to steal a 
silver spoon, 
has Ben Butler fu:. his counsel, and he'll he Caste out soon 
Its mighty o,ld for Tommy Doda lie's always safe to win, 
lie's run away, and married to the beautiful East Lynne. 
The Gentleman from Ireland is In and Out of Place, 
There's No Thoroughfare in Camden where a 
horse can run a 
race, 
Jack Sheppard robbed Othello; Falstaff's .(, t 
a 
cramp, 
The Black Crook and the White Fawn have collected many a 
stamp. 
The School for Scandal's open, Jonathan Bradford has gone in, 
With Coriolanus on his back, to sing him 
O'Linn ; 
The Tempest has subsided, now we'll have a 
Winter's Tale, 
There's something wrong, I'm thinking, with the Rose of Ettrick Vale. 
Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist are true friends now, I'm told, 
That's nothing new however; for, they were friends of old, 
Baal Pry is on His Last Legs: Robert Emmet lost his life, 
King, Richard the III. has run away with the Flying Dutchman's wife. 
A terrible Flash of Lightning was seen on the Jersey shore, 
The Rivals have bad a 
scuffle with the poet Thomas Moore; 
The Forty Thieves are all in jail, for making too much noise: 
The Toodles have run away with one of Julius Cwsar's boys. 
Our American Cousin's married. and Dundreary he has sneezed, 
Dick Turpin courted Jenny Lind and her band be gently squeezed; 
The Tame Cat began to howl ; the Wild Cats grew too fast, 
Shakespere woke up from his dream, and there was Light at Last. 
There v 
as Much Ado About Nothing when Luculluet slew the Mule. 
King Illuebeard's got another wife and now he'll p'a' the fool; 
Rip Van Winkle's gone to sleep, to learn How to pay the Rent, 
He's sorry now for what he done and the money he has spent.

THAT LITTLE BROWN JUG. 
Arranged and sung by BILLY COTTON. 
My wife and I 
live all alone, 
In a 
little brown hut we call our own, 
She loves gin, and I 
love rum, 
Oh, golly ! don't we have lots of fun ! 
OlIOnliS.

Feed her on ice cream all day, 
And go out riding on Broadway 
Ha! ha! ha! &e. 
When I 
go working on my farm 
I 
take my little brown jug under my arm. 
Set it under 1
,4mie shady tree— 
Little brown jug, don't I 
love thee! 
ha! ha! ha! tte. 
If all the gals in this here place 
Were put together in one place, 
Then I'd prepare to drop a

I SHOULDN'T LIKE TO TELL. 
'Twas in the early spring time, 
When bids began to mate; 
That first I 
met young Edward, 
Down by the garden gate. 
Upon the evening stillness, 
his voice so sweetly fell; 
The winning words he whispered, 
I 
shouldn't like to tell. 
In many a 
summer twilight, 
We stoo I 
together there; 
And, oh I 
the bright world never 
To me seemed half so fair 
As when, above the chiming 
Of distant village bell, 
I 
heard that loving story— 
I 
shouldn't like to tell. 
Bright vis:ons of the future, 
Our busy fancies wove; 
As arm-in-arm together, 
We wandered through the grove. 
The boblink's note was sounding 
In copse and shady dell; 
And I 
listened to the story— 
I 
shouldn't like to tell. 
46' 
Out there, one summer evening, 
When stars were shining bright; 
And the moon east all around us 
Her chaste and silver light. 
Beneath a 
broad leaved linden, 
I 
yet remember well. 
I 
gave a 
solemn tromise— 
I 
shouldn't like to tell.

MY LOVE SHE IS A COOK. 
I 
wonder where my Susie is ? 
She said she would meet me here; 
It's been a 
half an hour or more, 
And still she don't appear. 
There's something- must the matter be, 
Or she would not stay away ; 
I 
have not seen her loving face, 
A week ago to day. 
CHORUS. 
0 my love she is a 
cook, 
She has such winning ways; 
And a 
fascinating look. 
0 
yes, I 
love my Susie dear, 
Although she's but a 
cook; 
For she has such winning ways, 
And a 
fascinating look. 
0, Jimmy, you'll excuse me, 
For I 
could not conic last night ; 
My sister's cat was very sick, 
And the dog had got the gripes. 
But don't forget to- morrow, 
About the hour of half- past two; 
And I'll be in the kitchen, love, 
Awaiting there for you. 
CHORUS. 
My Susie she is handsome, 
She is upon my word ; 
She dances like a 
fairy, 
And sings just like a 
bird. 
My Susie says she loves me, 
And I 
know she loves rue too; 
And if she would prove false to me, 
it would break my heart in two. 
DRIVEN FROM HOME.

New York. Price 40 Cents.] 
Out in this cold world, out in the street, 
Asking a 
penny of each one I 
meet, 
Shoeless I 
wander about, thro' the day, 
Wearing my young life in sorrow away. 
No one to help me, no one to love, 
No one to pity me, none to caress— 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam; 
A 
child of misfortune, I'm driven from home. 
CHORUS. 
No one to help me, no one to bless, 
No one to pity me, none to caress; 
Fatherless, motherless, sadly I 
roam, 
Nursed by my poverty, driven from home. 
The flowers that bloomed, that I 
loved to see, 
Seem bowing their heads as if pitying me; 
The music that mingles with voices of mirth, 
From the windows of pleasure and plenty on earth, 
Makes me think what it is to be friendless and poor— 
And I 
feel I 
shall faint when I 
knock at the door; 
Turn a 
deaf ear, there's no one will come 
To help a 
poor wanderer driven from home, 
No one to help me, i&o. 
Oh! where shall I 
go, or what can I 
do ? 
I've no one to tell me what course to pursue; 
I'm weary and footsore, I'm hungry and weak, 
I 
know not what shelter to night I 
may seek. 
The Friend of all friends, who rules earth and sea, 
Will look with a 
pitying eye upon me ; 
I'll wander about. till His messenger comes 
To lead inc to father and mother at home. 
No one to help me, dr*

Gin with us we took, hot trotters I'd got in my hat, 
In the first front centre seat like royalty both of us sat. 
She disliked the pantomine, but was spooney on the clown, 
Said she, " Bill, that chap is a 
pal of mine," but to her I 
was down. 
Cuonts.— Sad, sad, tte. 
Shame, shame on the clown, for he was a 
young married man, 
Shame, shame upon her, for after him often she ran, 
She wanted to be a 
dancer, if he'd bring her out, 
And he promised that he would, poor girl! she's her clothes had 
to " spout." 
What she'd earned as a 
servant-maid she to pay the clown soon 
took, 
And the miseries she has caused this heart would fill a 
ha'p'nny 
book. 
Cuoars.— Sad, sad, eze. 
The last that I 
heard of her and her Joey the clown, 
They played iu the streets, and trudged it from town into town. 
Folks never will thrive if they don't to others act right ; 
If he'd not robbed me of my love she might have performed here 
to-night. 
If you for amusements wish, take advice from me in time, 
You should take your girl to a 
music hall, not to a 
pantomine. 
CHOKUS.—Sad, sad, atc.

THE STYLE IN WEIICII IT'S DONE. 
As Sung by BILLY Corros. 
I 
stand before you once again, 
A few words just, to say ; 
The subject of my song I'm sure, 
We each meet every day. 
Some men live fast and others slow, 
As hi rough the world we run; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
A man shall steal a 
horse, we read, 
And not be " brought to book; 
While another man across a 
hedge 
Is not allowed to look. 
This may seem contradictory, 
Indeed, to many a 
one; 
But so very much depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
The politician speechifies, 
And makes a 
great hurrah, 
Till another man he mounts the stand, 
And points out every flaw. 
He gets the nomination, 
And for Congress he does run ; 
Succeeds and laughs to think he knows 
The style in which it's done. 
Now has it ne'er occurred to you, 
How strange the mystery seems; 
That girls can dash along Broadway, 
Who scarce are in their teens? 
Their pas are poor, but still they dress. 
In a 
style that's number one, 
Da I 
suppose it all depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
I 
think I'll conclude my song. 
Perhaps you'll say 
it's time," 
But I 
hope that I 
have pleased you 
With my little bit of rhyme. 
Some may think it is too short 
A 
nil others it's too long : 
But very mueli depends upon 
The style in which it's done. 
HAVE YOU SEEN LOUISA. 
ir love a 
leetle gal, Louisa is her name, 
I 
asked her for to marry me, but avay from me she ran; 
I 
don't know vere to find hes, have you zeeu her in here, 
Her noze has got a 
Grecian Bend, 
But she years her own hair.

Riding on a

Und a

THE BOYS OF NEW YORK. 
As sung by BILLY COTTON. 
Say, Jack, I've been bothered some lately, 
By the poems that conies from the West, 
About Ileathern Chinees playing poker, 
With Bill Nye and all of the rest. 
But why don't they write of our city, 
About us and our big diamond pins, 
Where we always play keno and faro, 
And commit other such innocent sins. 
This is the town for big buffers, 
Where the elephant can always be seen, 
And pocketbook-droppers are waiting, 
To play tricks upon those who are green. 
If those fellows would like to play poker, 
Let them come here— we'll rope them in, 
And we'll fight them with pops or with bowies, 
For we are the lads for the shin. 
These fellows are great on their lingo, 
As their poets have given a 
proof, 
But we are the boys for a 
skirmish, 
And can put on a 
fine Mansard roof. 
Those fellows know nothing ' bout voting_ 
I'll bet that they cannot repeat, 
If Nve should depend on such duffers, 
Our man would always be beat. 
This smartness may do on the prairie, 
And snoozers may there have a 
fling, 
But if they would visit our city, 
We would teach them to work the old thing. 
WHEN THE CORN IS WAVING 
When the corn is waving. Annie dear,

HANDY ANDY. 
Sung by BILLY Corrox. 
Am..—" Billy Barlow." 
How are yez, me friends? sure I 
hope you're all well, 
My cruel misfortunes to you I 
will tell ; 
I 
was born on a 
Friday, that ill-omened day, 
"He's a 
blundering blackguard," my father did say. 
Och hone ! now ain't it a 
shame 
To be called Handy Andy, when Andrew's my name? 
My blunder, the first, I 
remember it yet, 
I 
was sent to the post office letters to get, 
‘. What name r axed the clerk, as I 
looked at him shy, 
."I'llat's none o' yet' business, ye blackguard," says I. 
Oelt hone, S:c. 
One morning there lay about two feet o' snow. 
Says my boss, " You must clear Millie pavement, ye know, 
Ile meant but the snow, but I 
cleaned it complete, 
By shovelling the bricks wid the snow in the street. 
Oeh hone, &e 
One night I 
was waiter, at a 
party so nice, 
They tould me to put the champagne in the ice ; 
I 
opened each bottle and thought it all right ; 
In the ice- water poured it, and ruined it quite. 
Och hone, &c. 
Says they, " Ye young stupid, see what you have done, 
You've spoiled our champagne. likewise all our fun, 
" 
Go bring in soda water." Says 1, " Enough said." 
Soap and water I 
brought, which they threw at my had.

AS GOOD AS GOLD. 
By J. U. Mn.nuriN. 
Though fond of jssllity sometimes,' 
I 
like a 
quiet life, 
And love a 
coy cy'ning pass'd, 
At hom with my old. wife ; 
She brought Inc neither house nor land. 
wjalill could soon be told, 
But she's a 
fortune in herself, 
And that's as hood as gold. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, she's as good as gold, she is, 
She's just as good as gold, 
And I 
can see she's fond of me, 
For she's as good as gold. 
She does not wear the finest robes, 
Nor dress in silk a 
tire, 
But then if she links fair to me, 
What more can I 
desire, 
Our house is not flits gi andest, but, 
As it keeps oat the cold, 
It pleases me and pleases her, 
And she's as good. as gold. 
Yes, she's, Ctr,a. 
When matters go a 
little wrong, 
And fortune seems to hown, 
If one's a 
wife as good as gold, 
One can't be long cast down ; 
For when I 
reach my home at night, 
She does not fret or scold, 
But always greets me with a 
smile, 
And that's as ;: ood as gold. 
For she's, &e. 
Contented folks are happier, 
Than those who've greatest wealth, 
For goll does not buy happiness, 
Nor can it putsch • so Lezdth ; 
My wife and I

V% hen we have !rrown old, 
To be as hi ppy then as new, 
And that's s

I'M SUCH A WINNING MAX 
As Sang by Miss BLANCHE CFIAPHAN. 
When I 
go on the street to walk, 
I 
look so fine and gay. 
The people stop to look at me, 
I've such .L 
winning way, 
I'm not the one to hesitate, 
But please the best I 
can. 
And all the ladies take to me, 
Fin such a 
winning man. 
Oh look at me, and gaze at me, 
Ill bet a 
double span, 
That all the pretty girls will say, 
He's just the winning man. 
I 
get myself up free of charge, 
For any ball or show, 
And then I 
call on all the b'hoys, 
To tell them T 
shall go, 
Then each one tries to buy me off, 
And I 
get all I 
can, 
Or else I 
go and cut them out, 
I'm such a 
winning man. 
Oh look at me, and gaze at me. 
And beat me if you can, 
I 
know the ladies here will say, 
I'm such a 
winning man. 
A 
young chap once came up to me, 
Says he, " Id like to know, 
flow you charm all the pretty girls, 
And make them like you so." 
Says I, " Young man, go ask your ma, 
Or else your sister Fan, 
And they will tell you why, ' Because, 
He's such a 
winning man. " 
Oh look at me, and 4
.:L7.t' at me, 
And beat me if you can. 
Every body's sister smiles 
On such a 
winning man.

BROKEN DOWN. 
Once I'd money plenty! 
And friends, too, by the score, 
Then fortune smiled upon me 
And no one passed my door, 
Now I'm poor and lonely, 
And not worth fifty cents, 
Now no one seems to know me, 
I'm completely broken down 
CHORUS. 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frcrinif 
No one seems to know me now, 
Because I'm broken down. 
With an ample fortune 
I 
went it rather fast, 
The pace was almost killing, 
And I 
found it couldn't last. 
Too proud to put the curb on, 
I 
thought myself high-bred, 
And now, for want of bread' at times 
I 
have to 
fast' instead.

I 
wanaer, tka. 
The immortal Shakespeare 
Says, 
All the world's a 
stage' 
And every man must ' play his part. 
From childhood to old age; 
And when I 
think of clays gone by, 
How I 
was made the tool 
Of rogues, and sharps, tis then I 
know, 
My part' has been ' the tool.' 
I 
wander, (to. 
Friends could recognize me, 
When Poole he made my coat, 
But when I 
had no ' Note to change,' 
How soon they changed their note 
An object sad and needy, 
I 
wander thro' the town, 
A living paradox am I, 
Hard up,' yet ' Broken Down.' 
I 
wander thro' the world, 
And meet with many a 
frown, 
The time to try your friends you'll find, 
Is when you're broken down. 
••••• 
I'M NOT SO YOUNG AS I USED TO BE. 
My name is Ebenezer Clam, 
I 
am a 
poor old nigger man, 
My time is drawing to a 
close, 
I'm getting rather slow ; 
60metimes I 
feel I 
can't tell how; 
how do you think I 
feel just now? 
Why, I 
feel just as young as I 
used to be 
Forty years ago. 
Oh! white folks all I 
feel so good, 
I 
feel as if I 
would if I 
could, 
But when I 
kinder try to do, 
I 
find it is no go. 
When I 
was young, I'd jump at the chance, 
Soon as the banjo struck up a 
dance ; 
But I'm not so young as I 
used to be 
Forty years ago. 
There's my old wire named Sarah Ann, 
My aninmted wdrming pan, 
I 
love to gaze upon her face, 
As black as any crow; 
I 
remember on our wedding day, 
Dancing the happy hours away ; 
But we're not so young as we used to be 
Forty years ago. 
Now what's the use to fret and sigh, 
Or lying idly down to die ? 
Life ' tis but a 
holiday, 
I'd have you all to know, 
So be like Ebenezer Clam 
For, I'll live as long as you all, 
And tell the young folks all about 
Some forty years ago.

ALL AMONG THE HAY.—[CONCLUDED.] 
She 's 
of bonny girls the queen, 
Born to be admir'd; 
Roaming out one day I'd been, 
Feeling rather tired, 
When as graceful as a 
fawn, 
She stood in my way, 
-With a 
cask of " Barleycorn," 
MI among * he hay. 
CRORUS.—All among the hay, itn 
Of the beer I 
had a 
sup, 
Feeling then " all right ;" 
She said " to the brimming cup 
I 
was welcome quite." 
But she soon did me astouad, 
Begg'd I'd go away; 
"Rakes," she said, " were often found 
All among the bay." 
Cuours.—All among the hay, d:o 
Still for all that I 
could see 
She was shamming cold; 
"Bought off" she should never be, 
I 
would not be " sold ;" 
Bouncing came a 
rival raw, 
But I 
made him " pay," 
Thrasli'd him like a 
load of straw, 
All among the hay. 
Cuoaus.—All among the hay, dro. 
Still I 
press'd, and she " gave in," 
Owning she was wrong; 
He 's 
no man tha 4- cannot win 
Woman with his tongue; 
Soon the bells will peal their notes 
On our wedding day; 
Then I'll sow my wildest " oats" 
All among the hay. 
Cuouns.—All among the hay, ate.

THE HUNGRY ARMY. 
'When I 
was young and in my prime, 
I 
thought I'd go and join the line, 
And as a 
soldier cut a 
shine, 
In a 
lot called the Hungry Army. 
Said the sergeant you are just the chap, 
And placed a 
knapsack on my back, 
They sent me off to Ballarat, 
To fight in the Hungry Army. 
CHORUS. 
Sound the bugle, blow the horn, 
Fight, for glory night and morn, 
hungry soldiers, ragged and torn, 
Just returned front the army. 
March, boys, march, the way is on before us, 
Shout., boys, shout, and join us in the chorus, 
March. boys, march, the foe is still advancing, 
Cheer, boys, cheer, for the new and happy land. 
I 
went to drill on one fine day. 
The wind was rather strong that way. 
It fact it blew us all away, 
This glorious hungry army. 
I've got a 
medal as you see, 
The workhouse presented it to me, 
For hanging- to a 
rotten tree, 
When the wind took the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, &e. 
They cut my hair with a 
knife and fork, 
And curled it with a 
cabbage stalk, 
And fed me on suite cabbage broth, 
To fight in the hungry army. 
They served it out in a 
large tin can, 
A teaspoonful to every man, 
I 
got, so fat. I 
could'nt stand, 
To fight, in the hungry army 
Then sound the bugle, & c. 
They sent me out to drill recruits, 
But they kicked roe with their hobnailed boots; 
Oh, takeI oh, take away these brutes, 
Of this 2.1uriuus hungry army. 
Now kind friends I 
tnu,:t be off, 
I 
think I 
smell the mutton broth, 
Here conies Generals Howl and Scoff, 
The heads of the hungry army. 
Then sound the bugle, &c. 
THE DARING SLACK WIRE. 
Good evening, Inv friends, I•11 hav e you to know, 
I 
went to it circus, a 
sh(;rt time ago, 
While in my box gazing. all about, 
Some fellow by my side like a 
bear shouted out. 
Spoken. — Yes, when I 
saw the fair creature so high up in 
the air, I 
could not help in the midst of toy excitement shout. 
ing out. 
CHORUS. 
Look where she goes, 
My own Sophia, 
Swinging-, by Jove, 
On the daring slack wire. 
Turn hint out, turn him out, turn him out., if you please 
'When two tal policemen poor Jerry ( lid seize, 
They hug, him, they tug him, they pull him about, 
But still from his box he continued to shunt, 
Look where she goes, dr.c. 
The shouting and bawling of poor old Jeremiah, 
Caused Sophia to start as she stood on the wire ; 
Her little foot slipped, and as downward she fell, 
And these were the words that per Jerry did yell. 
Look where she fells, 
My own Sophia, 
Falling, by Jove, 
From off the slack wire. 
Sophia broke her fall, and as she was descending, 
Showers of bouquets at her feet came rending. 
They kiekrd ont poor Jerry, for he was defeated, 
And this was the chorus the company repeated, 
Look where he goes 
Poor Jeremiah, 
Kicked out, by Jove, 
Thro' the girl on the wire.

JIM, THE CARMAN'S LAD. 
My name is Jim, the carman s 
lad, a 
jolly chap am I, 
I 
always am contented, be the weather wet or dry, 
I 
snap my fingers at the snow, and whistle at the rairk, 
I've braved the storm for many a 
day, and can do so again. 
CHORUS. 
Crack, crack, goes my whip, I 
whistle and I 
sing, 
I 
sit upon my wagon, I'm as happy as a 
king, 
My horses always willing, as for me, I'm never sad, 
None can lead a 
jollier life, than Jim, the carman's lad. 
My father was a 
carrier, many years ere I 
was born, 
He use to rise at daybreak, and go his rounds each morn, 
And then he'd tai:e me with him, especially in the spring, 
I'd love to sit upon the cart, and hear my father sing. 
Crack, crack, etc. 
I 
never think of politics, or any thing so great, 
I 
hate to hear their high bred talk, about the church and state, 
I 
act aright to man and man, and that's what makes me glad, 
You'll find there beats an honest heart, in Jim, the carman s 
lad. 
Crack, crack, etc, 
And then the girls all smile on me, as I

I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened Auckna-cloy 
With a 
turn o' the wrist 
My stick I 
twist, 
I 
am my mother's joy; 
I've thravellcd many 
mile, 
r10 win a 
coleen's SMile 
With a 
love o' my brart, for them I'd part, 
And many an hour beguile. 
But now I'm here to tell you all, 
The places 1 
have

And all the very 
In my thruels I 
have seen. 
CHORUS. 
For l'n) a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened Anckna-cloy, 
With a 
turn o' the Is Fist 
My stick I 
twist. 
And Pm my inother's joy.—[.Dance Garry9w013.3 
I've been to " La Bello France," 
Where the girls know bow to dance; 
If I 
left the hogs 
Yet I 
couldn't nit frogs, 
Tho' I've often had a 
chaoce ; 
Don't think that I 
am green, 
For in Germany I've lwrn, 
Where sausages strong*, 
And pretzels long, a 
or more I've seer,. 
Then into Roossia 1 
have rushed, 
The land of furs and capes, 
The men all make the women work, 
And the soldiers look like apes. 
For I'm a 
rovin' Irish Boy, 
I 
was christened A 
uekna-cloy. 
With a 
turn a' my wrist, 
My stick I 
twit. 
And I 
am icy mother's joy. 
To China thin I 
wint 
And got my hearts contint 
Of the briny say. 
And wretch-ed bad tay 
Enough to make me squint ; 
Japan then eame in view, 
Be my sow! I 
saw that too, 
But yellow Jack bigh broke my back, 
That's why I 
look so blue. 
Then sailin' 
stars and stripe', 
I 
reached Columbia's shore, 
And now I 
love the place so well, 
I'll never leave it more. • 
Except the cry will be, 
Come Paddy, join with me 
And brave once more, 
The Atlantic's roar, 
And make culd Ireland free."

THE RETIRED PHYSICIAN. 
Now, white folks, listen unto my song, 
A lovely ditty I'll sing for you, 
I'll sing it so loud, so you all can hear, 
And play it upon de banjo, too. 
It's all about a 
retired physician. 
Whose sands of life had near run out; 
For, the Sunday papers got down upon him, 
And his business all went up the spout. 
Oh! he wrote for Branch's Alligator, 
And paragraphs for the New-York Tribune, 
He cured every ill in human nature, 
And made funny woodcuts for the Picayune. 
He pulled out teeth for a 
shilling a 
dozen, 
Sold wooden legs made of Jersey bark, 
lie was father-in-law to the four cent man, 
That sells enwellopes round the Park. 
He made Brandeth's pills of castile soap, 
Which used to sell very well in a 
crowd 
lie inwebted a 
cylinder escapement shower bath, 
Which used to make him feel so proud. 
But the Sunday Leader exposed him quite, 
And he'll have a 
speedy revenge he vows, 
So he's gone to Brooklyn out of spite, 
And opened an office for stump tail cows.

THE HURDY GITRDY LAD. 
I 
don't feel very happy, nor I 
don't feel very sad,, 
So put me down as middling, although it is too bad; 
For any girl to serve a 
chap, as lately I've been served, 
But no girl shall take me in again, I'll never take their word. 
A 
girl I 
courted for six months, her Christian name was Fanny, 
I 
asked her if she'd have me, and she said she would be glad; 
But at present her intention was to stay home with her mammy, 
And she couldn't think of parting with her dear old darling dad. 
enonts. 
Yes, she said % would break her heart 
To go and leave her mammy, 
She said ' twould break her heart, 
To go and leave her dad ; 
But she's run away from both, 
My false, deceitful Fanny, 
And travels about the country, 
With a 
Hurdy Gurdy Lad. 
Now Fanny wasn't handsome, but I 
thought she was sincere, 
And then she had such winning ways, that made me her revere, 
But a 
hurdy-gurdy grinder, he used to come our way, 
And for Fanny's recreation, for hours he used to play ; 
Ife:d play awhile, then dance a 
bit, and then he'd sing a 
ditty, 
And I 
often gave a 
penny to the dirty half-grown man, 
He said he was an orphan, that eaus'd me him to pity. 
But never thought he'd cheek enough to run away with Fan. 
And as for her, she said, cf:e. 
Her father and mother were very fond of me, 
And often did invite me my Fanny for to see, 
I 
found her father 'brteca, and I 
found her mother rum. 
And on Fanny I 
invested a 
very tidy sum, 
For Fanny was a 
girl I 
always thought so well of; 
When I 
think how she served me, it my peace of mind destroys, 
Now of 01(1 Mother Cummings I'd often heard tell of, 
But I 
never thought she'd run off with the biggest of her boys. 
For she said, itc. 
Now when her father trsld me that Fan had cut her stick, 
I 
felt as if I 
had received a 
blow with half a 
brick, 
For I 
alway thought that Fanny, a 
little more pride had, 
Than to travel about the country with a 
hurdy-gurdy lad. 
I 
hear she's got a 
tambourine, and a 
voice that's loud and ringing 
And often in my wanderings, I 
fancy I 
shall meet 
This hurdy-gurdy grinder. and Fanny doing the singing, 
Giving a 
morning concert to some children in the street. 
For she said, dm 
; 
GOOD EVENING. 
thad been dining rather late, 
The fact I 
think it best to state, 
When I 
strolled out without a 
mate, 
One very pleasant eveniAg ; 
On fitneies bent my steps were led, 
As onward through the streets I 
strayed, 
A 
lovely figure I 
saw ahead, 
Walked past and said, " Good-evening." 
I 
felt a 
disappointed dunce, 
Not a 
word she answered in response, 
Though I 
repeated more than once, 
" 
Good-evening, Miss, good-evening." 
At length she turned her head this way, 
And you can judge of my dismay, 
She was fifty-five if she was a 
day, 
And of course I 
said " Good-evening." 
My disappointment made me queer, 
I 
stepped into an ale-house near, 
Addressed the bar-maid thus : " My dear, 
A 
glass of ale—good-evening." 
With sparkling eyes she an ale soon served, 
What is makes me so unnerved?" 
Close standing by me I 
observed 
My tailor, sir! 
Good-evening. 
His presence spoiled my wish to stay, 
I 
reached the door, then heard her say, 
" 
Please pay before you go away, 
Ten cents, sir, then good-evening." 
" 
Pray, pardon, Miss, I 
beg of you, 
I 
quite forgot," (and that was true,) 
The tailor says, " You often do ; 
Good-evening, Snuze, good-evening."

The fairest face of charming grace, 
That ever I

'Was on Broad'e.ay, the other day, 
While strolling leisurely.

Iler eyes were blue as heaven in hue, 
And her skin like alabaster ; 
But every grace on her sweet face, 
Was marked with sad disaster. 
And 
contend her Grecian Bend, 
Just perched upon her back, 
Drew long trains of brainless swains, 
That followed her in that track. 
But didn't she cut a

She was fair, 'but still her hair, 
Showed pride and self-conceit ; 
And it seemed true and lair to view, 
But it was all counterfeit.

When the false Ipiir from my Fashionable Belle 
Fell down at my feet.

One day there came a

She saw him! screara'cl, then ran away, 
I've never seen her more, sirs; 
But the Chinaman he calls each day,

For bringing her from China.

And though afar through distant lands I

The memories of the past my heart with longing Ha; 
To see the darling little ones at home. 
Ah ! now their forms I

Far o'er the raing ocean's foam,

Proclaim the joyous welcome, welcome home. 
The moon looks mildly down, the same as oft before, 
And bathes the earth in floods of mellow light,

As they seemed at home one year ago to- night. 
Sadly my heart still turns to thee, 
Wherever I

And meet again with those I

Never, never more from thee to roam;

STANDING ON THE PLATFORM. 
Going down to Long Branch, one fine day, 
I 
chanced to miss the train; 
I 
turned my head around, and there I 
saw, 
A 
sight which turned my brain. 
For there I 
saw a 
charming girl, 
The prettiest I'd ever seen: 
Her voice was sweet, her dress was neat, 
She was a 
fairy veen. 
oken.—Yes, she was the prettiest creature that I'd ever met 
in the whole course of my existence, and I 
considered myself very 
lucky that I 
happened to be— 
CHORUS. 
Standing on the platform, waiting for the train, 
I 
met this darling girl, who winked at me so plain: 
Bright blue eyes so sparkling, teeth were pearly white, 
She was just the pink of fashion, and just the girl you'd like. 
Pray, sir, can you tell me how long the train will be, 
Said I, " I'll ask the guard," 
"I thank you for your kindness, sir?" said she 
And looked at me so hard; 
We waited but a 
little while, 
For the train it soon was there, 
And then into one of the cars, 
I 
handed this lady fair. 
Spoken.—I 
was sorry to part with her, but she had to go one 
way, I 
had to go the other, and of course, I 
couldn't detain her 
all day, a— 
Standing on the platform, &e. 
She kissed her hand to me, and said, " Dear sir, 
Farewell, till next we meet." 
And oh! the look she gave me as the train went off, 
I 
assure you was a 
treat; 
Yet oh ! some day, I 
hope to meet, 
This charming creature divine, 
And when I 
do, I'll tell you all, 
About this love of mine.

THE HEN CONVENTION. 
A famous Hen Convention 
Was held in Humbug Green— 
Such a 
show of fuss and feathers 
Ne'er before was seen, 
With Malays, Bantams, Chitagongs, 
And game-fowls, fine and tall; 
But .N1r. Rooster SilaiOlai 
Cut the biggest swell of all. 
It was cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle, 
Flap your wings and crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the highest 
At the Hen Convention Show, 
Says Malay, pulling out his gills, 
"I'm the fairest fowl," 
Says Bantam, '• You're a 
hen-pick'd race— 
lien-hearted, with no soul." 
Says Shanghai, " Your poor Bantams 
Are a 
race of chicken toys," 
says Bantam, ' If you peck at me, 
You'll find I'm one of the boys." 
It was cackle, dm. 
A poultry duel came on straight— 
'Twos Bantam and Shanghai ; 
A crow at first, and then a 
clip, 
And then the feathers fly. 
Young Bantam spurred him flat, 
Amid a 
loud convention crow; 
And Shanghai shanged the lowest 
At the great Convention Show.

CASTrirS IN THE AIR, 
rirst introduced and sung in America by W, F. S. Lames. 
This world is all a 
babble, wherever we may go, 
There's nothing hero bat troubles, hardship, toil and woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we are never free from care, 
And at the best, this world is but a 
Castle in the Air. 
We are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some get wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat ; 
But WO will 410 the best we can, and never let despair 
"Usurp the place between us, and our Castles in the Air. 
There l a 
name known o'er the world, to Englishmen ' tis dear, 
And well may they be prouder him, their native Bard Shake. 
spear°; 
When first his playa came en the stage, he made the world stare 
And yet they were composed, while building Castles in the Air. 
If you take the works of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You 11 find his sayings are so wise, each sentiment so true; 
They'll ma;e you feel while reading them, as if you had been there, 
And yet they were composed while building Castles inthe 
rut yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And though a 
real true Scottish heart, ' twill make the blood to 
thrill, 
And though this world t3 him had been, a 
world full of care; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
His home a 
lowly Ploughman's Cot, yet strife there ne'er was see; 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jean; 
Beside the bank 0' Bonny Doon, near to the town O'Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The Irish bad their poet too, they loved him well I'm sure. 
Ile was a 
true born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moore; 
Of this world's sorrows, we know he had his share, 
Yet Moore was always happy, building Castles in 011 Air. 
Ile sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, wil' cherish yet his songs; 
Ile made the Irish heart rejoice, he bade them ne'er despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, Built bright Castles in the Air.

CrE PARTED BY 1-tt.b RIVER-SIDIL 
We parted by the river-side; 
The moon looked dovrn on you and Ina, 
The stars put on a 
look of pride, 
The river murmured to the sea: 
The dew-drops kissed the blushing roes, 
The gentle winds did sigh; 
One word larche nature's sweet repose, 
The sad word was: Good-bye! 
CIIORt78. 
Oh tell me that you love me yet, 
For, oh 1 
the parting gives me pain, 
Say, tell me that you'll not forget, 
For, we may never meet again! 
We parted by the river-side: 
A 
tear-drop trembled on your cheek, 
In vain. to tell my love I 
tried, 
My 
heart was sad, I 
could not speak. 
I 
promised that I 
would be true 
So long as I 
would live; 
The parting 1ds5 I 
gave to you, 
Was all Iliad to give. 
Oh! tell 
We 
parted by the river-side: 
And I 
have roamed a 
distant clime, 
My Leart has not forgot its pride; 
For, I 
have loved you all the time. 
And I 
am faithful to you still, 
While I 
believe you true; 
Afar or near, let some what will, 
ill love you, you, only you.
