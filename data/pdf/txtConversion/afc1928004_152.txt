UP W ITH THE L ARK IN THE MORNING. 
I 
like to be jully in a 
moderate way, 
But think it a

No " Jull Dog" am I. 
On my eNertion I

And hough I 
have the heart to spend, 
I've still the sense to save.

Nor toss

one, two, three, 
Merry and wise is t e 
motto for n 
e, 
And up with the lark in the morning. 
There's a 
time for pleasure : nd a 
time ior play, 
A 
time to labor and a 
time to be gt.y, 
If 
the sun shines bright, y( u

And I'll tell you the reawn why. 
To-da., we may be bale and strong, 
To-morrow who can tell, 
Without the he dth to earn a

Without a

So I 
never drink hard, (to. 
It I 
had the money that some have got, 
I'd scatter a 
bit in the laborer's cot, 
And the struggling poor, for I 
pity their lot, 
No miserly man am I. 
So I've always a

want to spend, 
I've always a

Will one day equal them.

.TUDGE NOT A MAN BY HIS CLOTHING. 
By AXTON STItAUB. 
The Music of this Song is published by E. U. HARDING, _
238 Bowery. 
Price 10 Cents. 
Judge not a 
man by the cost of his clothing, 
Unheeding the life path that he may pursue ; 
Or oft you'll admire a 
heart that needs loathing, 
And fail to give honor ,N 
here honor is due. 
The palm may be hard, and the fingers stiff-jointed, 
The coat may be tattered, the cheek worn with t 
But greater than kings are labors anointed, [ kr.pe 
You can't judge a 
man by the coat that I.e wears. 
Give me the man as a 
friend and a 
neighbor, 
Who toils at the loom, with the spade or the plough ; 
Who wins his diploma of manhood by labor, 
And purchases wealth by the sweat of his brow. 
-Why should the broadcloth alone be respected, 
And the man be despised who in fustian appears 
While the angels in heaven have their limbs unp otected [Thprot. 
You can't judge a 
man by,,the coat that he wears. 
Judge of a 
man by the work he is doing, 
Speak of a 
man as his actions demand ; 
Watch well the path that each is pursuing, 
And let the most worthy be chief of the land ! 
And that man shall be found 'mid the close ra• ks of labor, 
Be known by the work that his industry rears; 
And the chiefdom when won shall be dear to his neighbor.[Repeat. 
And we'll honor the man whatever he wears. 
CALL HER BACK, AND KISS HER. 
(The music of this piece. arranged for the voice and the pianoforte, 
is published in De Witt s 
Half Dime Series of Choice _Music. 
For sale 
by L. M. De Witt, 13 Frankfort Street. 
Price five cents.) 
There's nothing half so charming 
As a 
happy married life, 
And nothing so alarming 
As a 
vixen for a 
wife; 
But as you make your bed, you know, 
So in it you must De. 
us useless then to make a 
fuss— 
Take my advice, don t 
try. 
CHORUS. 
A woman's sure to go her way, 
But when she's gone we miss her; 
So if you've had an angry word 
Why call her back and kiss her. 
A wife will surely rule the roost, 
Of course tItAts very proper, 
And if she means to rule you too, 
I 
don't think you can stop her. 
Be never cruel, always kind, 
Do nothing that will tease her, 
And if you wish to happy live, 
You'll do your best to please her. 
A woman's sure, d5c.. 
A 
woman's sure to have her way. 
For that we cannot blame her, 
The remedy ! ahi then I 
say, 
Ms kindness that will tame her. 
Be always gentle, never harsh, 
And mind you do not flout her; 
And remember you're but helpless men, 
And cannot do without her. 
A woman's sure, & c. 
That woman is your greatest joy, 
Let every man reflect, 
Don't treat her as a 
wothies toy 
Nor slight her with neglect; 
Yf you possess a 
woman's love, 
What more does any need, 
In sicknesss or in health she'll be, 
A comforter indeed. 
A woman's sure, dr,o

PADDY THE PIPER.. 
When I 
was a 
boy in my father's mud edifice, 
Tender and bare as a 
pig in a 
sty, 
Out at the door as I 
gazed with a 
steady phi; 
Who but Pat Marphy the piper came by ? 
Says Paddy, " Few play this music; can you play r 
Says I, " I 
can't tell, for I 
never did try," 
He told me that he had a charm, 
To make the pipes prettily speak, 
Then squeezed a 
bag under his arm, 
And sweetly they set up a 
squeak., 
With a 
farala, larala be, och! honey, how he handled the drone, 
And then such sweet music he blew, "twould have melted the 
heart of a 
stone. 
" 
Your pipes," said I, " Paddy, so neatly came over me, 
Naked I'll wander wherever it blows; 
And if my father should try to recover me, 
Sure it won't be by describing my clothes, 
The aliusic I 
hear now takes hold of my ear now, 
And leads me all over the world by the nose. 
So I 
follow his bagpipe so sweet, 
And sung, as I 
leap like a 
frog, 
Adieu to my family seat, 
So pleasantly placed in a 
bog. 
With my farala, 
larala loo, how sweetly he handled the drone, 
And then such sweet music he blew, twould have melted the 
heart of a 
stone 
Full five years I 
followed him, nothing could sunder 
Till he one morning had taken a 
sup, 
And slipped from a 
bridge in a 
river just under us, 
Souse to the bottom just like a 
blind pup. 
I 
roar'd out, and bawled out, and lustily call'd out, 
"0 Paddy, my friend, don't you mean to come up 7" 
He was deadus a 
nail in a 
door;— 
Poor Paddy was lald on the shelf 
So I 
took up his pipes on the shore, 
And now I've set up for myself. 
With my farala, larala loo, to be sure I've not got the nack 
To play, farala, larala bo, and bubaroo didaroo whack.

WISH I WAS A FISH.

Sweet Polly Primrose was a 
girl 
Of nineteen summers old, 
I 
Icved sweet Polly better fac

And she was very fond of me;

So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish with a 
great long tail, 
I 
wish I 
was a 
fish with a 
great big tail, 
A tiny little tittle bat, a 
winkle or a 
whale, 
At the bottom of the deep blue sea. OnI my I 
Sweet Polly,was on board a 
ship, 
And bound for Union Square ; 
When the vessel sighted - Tammany," 
It began to pitch and rear; 
Aly love was gazing over 
At the water rolling by, 
When, somehow, she tumbled overboard, 
And never said good-bye. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, dr-e. 
The Captain and his gallant crew 
Jumped overboard to save 
Ily" darling Polly, but in vain 
She'd sunk beneath the wave 
And when they told me of her fate, 
I'd tear my hair and weep. 
And requested I 
might be allowed 
To plunge into the deep. 
So ii wish I 
was a 
fish, &a 
I 
had a 
dream last night that I 
Was down below the wave, 
And there I 
saw my Polly 
In a 
gorgeous coral cave; 
She'd changed into a 
mermaid, 
And she'd such a 
splendid tail, 
She was doily= double t5 huffies, 
In conjunction with a 
whale. 
So I 
wish I 
was a 
fish, &c. 
While she's a 
sportive mermaid, 
so wretched here above: 
So I 
think l'll take a 
plunge and be 
A merman with my love; 
But the precise locality, 
I 
don't exactly know, 
Where I 
may find my Polly 
So perhaps id best not go. 
So I 
wish I 
was a

I 
met shooting stars who were bent upon sport, 
But who " shot" in a 
very strange manner I 
thought; 
And one thing beat all by chalks I 
must say, 
That was when I 
got into the Milky Way; 
I 
counted the stars, till at last I 
thought, 
I'd found out bow much they were worth by file quart, 
An unpolite "Aerolite" who ran 'gainst my car, 
Wouldn't give "e'er a 
light," to light my cigar. Whilst up, ate. 
Next a 
comet went by 'midst fire like hail, 
To give me a 
lift, I 
seized hold of his tail, 
To where he was going I 
didn't enquire, 
We'd gone past the moon, till we couldn't get higher; 
Yes, we'd got to the furthermost!! don't think I 
joke, 
When somehow I 
felt a 
great sheck—I awoke! 
When instead of balloon, moon and planets, I 
saw, 
I'd tumbled from off of my bed to the floor. 
Ziorms —And there was no balloon,—there was no balloon, 
There were not any planets, and there wasn't any moon, 
So never sup too heavy, or by jingo very soon, 
You're like to fancy yen are goin up in a 
balloon.

DON'T STAY OUT TOO LATE AT NIGH I
'. 
Gaily go the moments by, - 
When friends in merriment unite, 
Swiftly hours of pleasure fly, 
When youth and folly tend their flight. 
But while social joys we share, 
Let prudence limit our delight, 
To keep the morrow free from care, 
Don't stay out too late at night. 
'Tis sweet to taste at early dawn, 
The fragrance that the moist earth yields; 
The fresh and balmly breath of morn, 
Rising from the lanes and fields, 
But to be " Healthy, wealthy, and wise," 
The proverb, if translated aright, 
Is early to bed and early to rise, 
And don't stay out too late at night. 
Of grief, tho' each man gets his share, 
Increasing it he's oft employ 'd, 
Many a 
trouble and many a 
care, 
We make ourselves, we might avoid: 
But oh ! in doing all we can, 
To spoil the memory of delight, 
The safest and the surest plan 
Is staying out too late at night. 
Youth, they say, will have its ding, 
But nature has this certain law, 
That age must pay the reckoning, 
If the account we overdraw. 
But to be healthy, wealthy, and wise, 
The proverb, if translated aright, 
Is early to bed and early to rise, 
And don't stay out too late at night.

ACT ON THE SQUARE , 
BOYS. 
By ALFRED LEE. Author of " Champagne Charlie." 
[The muLtttie of this piece, arranged for the voice and the pianoforte, 
is published in De Witt's Half Dime Series of Choice Music. 
For salo 
by R. M. De Witt, 13 Frankfort Street. 
Price five cents.] 
Through being fond of acting right, 
Straightforward, just and fair 
I 
try to make my troubles ligh 
And little do I 
care; 
As happy as a 
king I 
live 
On just what I 
can spare, 
And from experience I 
give 
This hint, act on the square. 
CHORUS. 
Act on the square, boys, act on the square; 
Upright and fair, boys, act on the square; 
Act on the square, boys, act on the square, 
-Upright and fair, boys, act on the square. 
Now in the street a 
thing so bad, 
Which often is the case, 
A 
swellish, foolish looking lad 
Some modest girl will chase; 
Then, square you round, and let him see 
If he annoyance dare, 
You'll give him striking proof to show 
Now to act on the square. 
Act on the square, boys, (to. 
When out one night with noisy swells, 
TIC Haymarket kept alive, 
One Sergeant X with oyster shells 
To pelt they did contrive; 
They nearly got into disgrace, 
But squaring served them there, 
And brightly shone the Bobby's face, 
Who liked to see things square. 
Act on the square, boys, & e. 
I 
never liked a 
round game, nay, 
Round tables can't a-bear ; 
And in a 
circus I 
can't stay, 
SoI live in a

Now brther-,.

TX NOT IN LOVE. 
CROSSING ON THE FERRY. 
Oh I 
please don't laugh when I 
relate 
To you a 
story sweet: 
It's all about a 
charming girl 
That I 
by chance did meet. 
'Twas love at first sight when we 
Those lips so red and cherry. 
Oh I 
what a 
stunning girl it was, 
That I 
met on the ferry. 
CHORUS. 
met, 
Walking through the cabin, passing all the style. 
Smiling on the fair sex, hours to beguile, 
Nothing yet can cheer me; for, I 
can't be merry, 
since I 
met that little dear crossing on the ferry. 
I 
scarcely knew which way to look; 
For, she a 
magnet seemed; 
Electric sparks I 
thought I 
felt, 
So bright her eyes they beamed; 
For, every glance was like a 
lance, 
As in my heart they'd bury: 
Until I 
felt, I 
scarce know how, 
While crossing on the ferry. 
Walking through the cabin, &O. 
Our journey's end at last approached, 
My heart beat slow and fast, 
While passengers ran here and there, 
My love among them passed. 
She turned her head and spoke to me. 
In a 
voice so soft and merry, 
saying 
Write a 
note to Station D. 
Sign, Crossing on the ferry. 
walking through the cabin. Alrn. 
Oeh ! I'm not in love, but I 
feel very queer, 
But I've felt just the same iver sin' you've been here ; 
My heart gives a 
thump, dear, whenever you're nigh, 
And I 
cannot look into the black of your eye. 
hould down my head, and I'm blushing with shame, 
Whenever I 
hear, or I 
think of your name ; 
So what can it be, dear, that troubles me so ? 
You're wiser than me, dear, for sure I 
don't know. 
Och ! a 
killing black eye, sure, I 
know that I 
love, 
And a 
blacker than yours, dear, no other eon prove ; 
I 
know that I 
like, too, a 
straight 11-oinan nose. 
And your own is as straight as the river that flows. 
I 
know that I 
love, too, a 
lily white hand, 
And a 
boy that belongs to a 
volunteer band, 
And I 
see that your hand is as white as the snow, 
And I 
hear that to drill very often you go. 
Och 1 
my mother and father, are decent, ye know, 
My sisters are wedded, my brother also; 
So, why should I 
linger or stand on the shelf ? 
For they're none of them better a 
bit, than myself. 
My pulse beats so slow, and my heart beats so high, 
Find out what's the matter, I'd like ye to thry, 
And if ye find out what's the matter wid ire, 
I'll give you my heart, dear, instead of a 
fee.

First, then, I've had the gout, asthma and lumbager, 
Diphtheria, sciatica, with rheumatism too, 
Prowl/aids, and I've been a 
martyr to the ager 
Korn-night, ddralgia, tic-dollyroo. 
All these affairs, die. 
I've also had the tooth- ache, corns, warts raid bunions, 
Scarietina, concertina, tightness of the chest; 
Pains in the knee-joints—oh, such very funny 'uns, 
My 
sufferings from the measles, too, can scarcely be express'a. 
All these affairs, ci,c. 
Then I've had the colic, spasms, dizziness and swimmings,

Mullygruhs and collywohbles, with delicious trimmings, 
In fact I 
cannot tell you all the sufferings I've gone thro'. 
All these affairs, &c. 
I've had one or two more complaints, that I've forgot to men-

will relate— Non,

Tons of IIolloway's ointment, but I 
found it would not do.

CASTLES IN THE AIR. 
As sang by Gus Wit 
I 
IAMt3 
This world is all a 
bubble, wherever we may go, 
There's nothing hero but troubles, hardship, toil and woe; 
Go where we will, do what we may, we arc never free from care, 
_‘ml at the best, this world is but a 
Castle in the Air. 
We are rocked upon the sea of life, just like a 
little boat, 
And some get wrecked upon the rocks, and never get afloat; 
But we will do the best we can, and never let despair 
Usurp the place between us, and our Castles in the Air. 
There is a 
name known o 
er the world, to Englishmen ' tis dear. 
And well may they be proud of him, their native Bard Shake-
speare ; 
"When first his plays came en the stage, he made the world star° 
And yet they were composed, while building Castles in the Air. 
If you take the works of Shakespeare, and study them well 
through, 
You 11 find his sayings are so wise, each sentiment so true; 
They'll make you feel while reading them, as ify on had been there, 
And yet they were composed while building Castles inthe Air. 
But yet there is another name, to Scotchmen dearer still, 
And though a 
real true Scottish heart, ' twill make the blood to 
thrill, 
And though this world t ) him had been, a 
world full of ' are; 
Yet Burns was always happy, building Castles in the Air. 
His home a 
lowly Ploughman's Cot, yet strife there ne'er was seen, 
So happy and contented had he lived wee his Jean; 
Beside the bank 0' Bonny Doon, near to the town O'Ayr, 
The immortal Bobby Burns, built bright Castles in the Air. 
The Irish had their poet too, they loved him well I'm sure. 
He was a 
trite born Irishman, his name was Thomas Moore; 
Of this world's sorrows, we know he had his share, 
Yet Moore was always happy, building Castles in th.• Air. 
Ho sang the rights of Ireland, he sang against her wrongs, 
And many loving Irish hearts, nil' cherish yet his songs; 
He made the Irish heart rejoice, he bade them meet. despair, 
And for Ireland in the future, Built bright Castles in the Air.

Don't imagine yonA meet with a

Whene'er there's a

THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE.—[CONCLUDED.] 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl up a 
tme, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
girl dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—what some folks call—a 
cake: 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dress'd as a " swell," 
A book with a 
cover that's olden and worn 
Has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar, and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow-flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
Ms a 
wonder their dear necks don't break, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one, for love, nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
When you wed, do not marry the fam'ly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or—that's where you'll make the mistake. 
But—talking of marriage—reminds me, 
We've given the Germans a 
shake: 
They fancied Louise and her cash was for them, 
That's where they made the mistake. 
Don't imagine your milk is not " doctored," 
Nor quite pure is your two-shilling tea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first time you go on the sea. 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a 
drake, 
Don't go and eat mustard, and fancy it's jam, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
With all the advice f 
have given, 
You ought 10 be well wide-awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any more, 
That's where you liSik the 11114AT.

THE DUTCHMAN'S SLATE. 
Ant—" Enoch Arden." 
Kind friends, you was listen, I 
told rrlu one story 
What happened to me, here, one da. 
I 
keep of this city a 
lager-bier saloon, 
And I 
think of that business will pay. 
But my lager run out, and my Switzer-Kase, too, 
And I 
found out, when it has been too late, 
Of you want to make money in this kind of business, 
By dam I 
you must not keep a 
slate. 
My friend, Gasper Mintz, he called on me one day, 
And asked me for em n 
glass of bier: 
Re drink that, and said: It was bully 1 
anudder, 
And then rubs his belly—right here. ‘, 
He called for more lager, and Switzer-Kase, too; 
And then he said: That was first rate 
When I 
ask him for pay, he do so—mit his eye, 
And, told me : Put that on the slate. 
Now, I 
don't like that business : and so I 
was told him, 
One day, when he came mit my store, 
An I 
there T 
saw Gasper a- drinking mine lager, 
And hug7in' my wife mit the docir: 
I 
t . ke him shust so, mit the slack of his breeches, 
And pitch him right out on his head: 
bke down that slate, and I 
break up that business, 
And den, ten tangent! 1 
I 
was mad.

I WILL STAND BY MY FRIEND. 
As we go on through life's career, 
How many have to rough it ? 
While one gives us a 
helping hand, 
A dozen try to buffet.. 
Still let's be faithful where we can, 
A 
helping hand to lend; 
My maxim is, that, come what may, 
I 
will stand by my friend I 
My maxim is, 43tc. 
When well to do in life, 
We all a 
ready welcome get; 
It's " How do you do, to-day, my boy ? 
I'm glad that we have met." 
But, if in our career through life; 
Bad luck does us attend, 
How few will give a 
hand and say, 
I 
will stand by my friend 1 
How few will, eze. 
A friend in need is one indeed; 
His heart and hand he lends; 
How different where we have to say, 
Oh! save us from our friends! 
With many friendship's but a 
name, 
No sympathy they lend, 
They bid good-day, but never say, 
I 
will stand by my friend I 
They bid, &e. 
MY SISTER DEAR. 
From the Opera of MASSANIELLO.' 
My sister, dear, o'er this rude cheek, 
How oft I've felt the tear-drop stealing, 
When those mute looks have told the feeling 
Heaven denied thy tongue to speak, 
And thou hadst comfort in that tear 
Shed for thee, my sister, dear. 
But now, alas! I 
weep alone, 
By thee—by joy, by hope forsaken, 
Mid thoughts that darkest fears awaken 
Trembling for thy fate unknown, 
And vainly flows the bitter tear, 
Shed for thee, my sister, dear.

Talk about your bathing, 
Or strolling on the sands, 
Or some unseen verandah, 
Where gentle zephyr fans; 
Or rolling home in the morning, boys, 
And very nearly tight, 
Could never beat a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
Chorus.-A

I 
like to take my sweetheart, 
"Of course, you would," said he, 
And softly whisper in her ear, 
"How dearly I 
love you!" 
And when you picture to yourselves 
The scenes of such delight, 
You'll want to take a 
ramble 
Upon a 
starry night. 
Chorus.-A 
starry night, 4rte. 
Some will choose velocipede, 
And others take a 
drive, 
And some will set and mope at home 
Half dead and half alive; 
And some will choose a 
steamboat, 
And others even fight, 
But I'll enjoy my ramble 
Upon a 
starry night.

And a 
brisk and lively breeze; 
A 
little crew and a 
captain too, 
To carry me over the seas; 
To carry me over the seas, my boys, 
To my true love so gay, 
She has taken a 
trip on a 
government ship, 
Ten thousand miles away.

roving I 
will go,

T:* start by the morning train, to cross the raging main, 
For l'm on the move to my own true love, 
Ptra thousand miles away. 
My true love she is beautiful, 
My true love she is young; 
Her eyes are blue as the violet's hue 
And silvery sounds her tongue; 
And silvery sounds her tongue, my boys, 
But while I

She is doing the grand in the distant land, 
Ten thousand miles away. [So blow, ow. 
Oh ! that was a 
dark and dismal day, 
When last she left the strand, 
She bid good bye with a 
tearful eye, 
And waved her lilly hand; 
She waved her lilly hand, my boys, 
As the big ship left the bay, 
And says she, remember me,

She 's 
of bonny girls the queen, 
Born to be admied; 
Roaming out one day I'd been, 
Feeling rather tired, 
When as graceful as a 
fawn, 
She stood in my way, 
With a 
cask of " Barleycorn," 
All among the hay. 
CRORUS.—All among the hay, (te 
Of the beer I 
had a 
sup, 
Feeling then " all right ;" 
She said " to the brimming cup 
I 
was welcome quite." 
But she soon did me astound, 
Begg'd I'd go away; 
"Rakes," she said, " were often found 
All among the hay." 
CHORUS.—All among the hay, 3ze 
Still for all that I 
could see 
She was shamming cold; 
"Bought off" she should never be, 
I 
would not be " sold ;" 
Bouncing came a 
rival raw, 
But I 
made him " pay," 
Thrash'd him like a 
load of straw, 
All among the hay. 
Cnonus.—All among the hay, dm 
Still I 
press'd, and she " gave in," 
Owning she was wrong; 
He 's

On our wedding day; 
Then I'll sow my wildest " oats"

OUT IN THE COLD. 
By SAM BAGIs;ALL. 
Gazing on noblemen's mansions of splendour, 
Fill' ii with perfume and shining with gold, 
A thought often strikes me, do great ones remember 
Those that are shivering out in the cold. 
Hungry, dejected, feet unprotected, 
Houseless, homeless—sad to behold, 
Eyes red with crying, care- worn and sighing, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
No one to soothe the sad heart of sorrow, 
None to pity—plenty to scold ; 
None will ask if he lives to-morrow, 
Shivering and shaking out in the cold. 
ITungry, & c. 
What has he done to be so neglected ? 
Why do you thrust lini away from the door ? 
Perhaps he was once most highly respected, 
The answer is simply,—because he is poor. 
Hungry, (
te, 
What is that dark-looking object, before us ? 
A funeral, carried from the workhouse I'm told, 
They're taking a 
poor wretch home to his friends, 
They found him last night out in the cold. 
Hungry, (I7c. 
Friends of the churchyard, none there will scorn him, 
E'en from the best down to the worst ; 
Hell soon be forgotten, no one will mourn him, 
Where he commingles his dust with the dust. 
Hungry, & c. 
Sad scenes of sorrow, each coming morrow, 
Brings in its dull stealthy pace day by day; 
Heaping- fresh troubles on man to his horror, 
Till death seals his doom, aud he passes away. 
Hungry, & c.

I 
am a 
jovial collier lad, 
As blithe as blithe can be, 
For let the times be good or bad, 
They're all the same to me ; 
'Tis little of the world I 
know, 
And care less for its ways, 
For where the dog- star never glows, 
I 
wear away my days. 
CHORUS. 
Down in a 
coarmine, underneath the grow (I, 
Where a 
gleam of sunshine never can be found; 
Digging dusky diamonds all the season round, 
Down in a 
coal mine underneath the ground. 
My bands are horny, bard and black 
With working in the vein, 
And like tho clothes upon my back, 
My speech is rough and plain ; 
Well, if I 
stumble with my tongue, 
I've one excuse to say, 
'Tis not the collier's heart that's wrong, 
'Tis the head that goes astray. 
Down in a 
coal mine, &c. 
At every shift, be't soon or late, 
I 
haste my bread to earn, 
And anxiously my kindred wait, 
And watch for my return: 
For death that levels all alike. 
Whate'or their rank may be, 
Amid the fire and damp may strike 
And fling his darts at me. 
Down in a 
coal mine, ike. 
How little do the great ones care 
Who sit at home secure, 
What hidden danzers colliers dare— 
What hardships they endure! 
The very fires their mansions boast 
To cheer themselves and wives, 
Mayhap were kindled at the cost 
Of jovial colliers' lives. 
Down in a 
coal mine, 86e. 
Then cheer up, lads, and make ye much 
Of every joy ye can, 
But let your mirth be always such 
As best becomes a 
man; 
However fortune turns about 
We'll still be jovial souls, 
For what would nations be without 
The lads that look for coals.

I 
wouldn't exchange the girl I 
love, 
There's bliss in every look. 
To see her dance the polka, 
I

THE CONCERTINA MAN. 
I'm an open-air musician, and something of a 
star, 
To satisfy the public I 
journey near and far ; 
With a 
fiddle and a 
harp each day we meet, 
And play the poplar melodies in almost ev'ry street, 
I 
play the Concertina, and I 
don't mind saying 
That the open-air arrangement is as cheerful as its paying, 
I 
was happy till one day I 
play'd outside her door, 
But now I've done with happiness forevermore. 
CHORUS. 
Her name was Angelina, and she liked the Concertina, 
You really should have seen her when I 
played outside her door, 
I'm sure no love was keener than I 
felt for Angelina, 
But she's cut the Concertina, I 
shall never see her more. 
In a 
house down a 
street not far from this place, 
Lived the object of my love, such a 
figure, such a 
face; 
I 
play'd outside her door, not selfishly for pelf, 
But just to catch a 
glimpse of her lovely self; 
The fiddle and the harp used to grumble and say— 
That love was all bosh and never would pay; 
But I, I'd have travelled North, East, West and South, 
To gain but one sight of that eyes and those mouth. 
Her name was, cte. 
She said she wanted lessons, and I 
gladly taught her, 
And one of Lachenal's instruments, a 
beauty ' twas I 
bought 
her; 
She learnt, I 
wooed, the hours flew by, all, now I'm going to tell, 
flow one day going down to Kew, my hopes went down ab 
well,

I 
loved that girl to madness, yes, horrid Jones, you knew it, 
Such treatment from a 
chum, I 
can't find words to tell, Oh— 
Your conduct's doubly base Jones, in fact a 
violent-sell-o. 
Her name is, dr.e. 
The day was fine she was on board, we took a 
lot of money, 
When Tubbs, the fiddle, says to me, says he " It's rather 
funny; 
The way that Angelina looks at Jones, and Jones at she, 
I 
saw them wink, and if they're not all right its odd to me." 
I 
rush'd at Jones and took him by his ugly nose, just so, 
When Angelina started up, and screamed " just let him go: 
My feeling shall are haltered, and my mind is chang'd for ever, 
I'm Jones', Jones' honly," were the words, so help me never. 
Her name was, &c. 
Oh, agonies of agonies, I 
gave an awful leap, 
And jump'd from off the steamer into the briny deep: 
It was unfortunate for me, the tide was very low, 
I 
could not drown, oh cruel fate to serve a 
fellow so. 
They fish'd me out all muddy, and a 
sadly wiser man, 
Though Angelina's conduct forget I 
never can; 
I 
mean to stick to business, and hope each night to see, 
Tour smiling faces while you join in chorus here with me.

NEVER PUSH A MAN WHEN HE IS GOING 
DOWN THE HILL. 
In this sensation century, 
Good songs are very few, 
The words are little car'd for, 
If the music it is new; 
And subjects they are hard to find. 
But I 
have found one still, 
That's " Never push a 
man because 
He's going down the hill." 
CIIMUS. 
Then help one another, boys, 
Should fortune on you shine, 
Remember, when you give your mite, 
" 
That poverty's no crime I" 
Though little be the offering, boys, 
Give it with good will, 
But never push a 
man because 
lie's going down the hill. 
In this wide world, there's many a 
man, 
With brave and honest heart, 
Who to raise his wife and family 
In business makes a 
start; 
But still his ends don't seem to meet, 
'Work which way he will, 
Fate seems to be against him, 
And—he's going down the hill. 
Then help, & c. 
As we journey on in daily life, 
flow many men we find, 
That Poverty's a 
grievous sin, 
To think they are inclin'd. 
They meet, in sad adversity, 
Some old friend, Tom or Bill, 
And pass him by disdainfully. 
As he's going down the hill. 
Then help, &c. 
Should e'er you meet an honest man 
Struggling on with fate, 
Neer speak words of discouragement, 
Nor tell him 'tis " Too late!' 
Don't sneer as you pass by him, 
But help him with a 
will. 
And perhaps some day you'll meet him 
On the summit of the hill. 
Then help, &c.

WHEN THE BAND BEGINS TO PLAY. 
Written and composed by G. 
W . 
H UNT. 
I'm very fond of music—to me its quite a 
treat, 
Unless it be from German Bands, or Organs in the street. 
Thro' list'ning to a 
band ono day, I 
fairly lost my heart 7 
The leader ' twas who found it and he now with it won't part. 
CITOILT:S. 
Oh ! I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, 
When the band begins to play, when the band begins to play, 
I'm very fond of music, I 
could listen all the day, 
Especially when my Charlie leads the band—Porn, Porn. 
My Charlie is my darling—the beau ideal of loves, 
With his hair so black and curly, and his whitest of.whi to gloves. 
My love stands in the middle, with his baton in his hand, 
And leads the instrumentalists in a 
style that I 
think grand. 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when tho baud begins to play, ecc. 
They play such jolly music—waltz, polka, and quadrille, 
And sometimes play so feelingly, it gives me a 
quite thrill, 
The leader sometimes gives a 
frown, and looks as though he's rash; 
And then they play so soft and sweet, and after comes a 
crash. 
Oh I 
I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, & c. 
sow, where my Charlie's to be seen, I 
don't intend to tell, ' 
For fear that ho might captivate some other belle as well. 
lie's asked me " one small question,"—I 
gave him my reply— 
In about a 
month there will not be a 
happier wife than I. 
Oh! I 
feel so awfully jolly when the band begins to play, &o.

Oh ! Brigham, Brigham Young, It's a 
miracle how he survives; With his 
 • 
roaming rams and his pretty little lambs, And his five-and-forty wivts. 
Ris number forty-five is about sixteen, 
Number one is sixty-and-three; 
And they make such a 
riot, 
How he ever keeps them quiet, 
Is a 
down-right mystery to me. 
For they clatter and they claw, and jaw, jaw, jaw, 
And each has a 
different desire, 
It would aid the renown 
Of the best shop in town, 
To supply them with-half they require.— Cho.

BRIGHAM YOUNG.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
wribam Young was a 
stout man once, 
nougu now lie rs 
And I 
grieve to state 
He is bald on his pate, 
Which once had a 
covering of gold. 
For his youngest wives don't like white wool, 
And his old ones won't have red; 
So with tearing it out, 
Taking turn and turn about, 
They have torn all the hair from his head.—Cnoans. 
Now his girls sing psalms all day, 
And his boys they all sing songs; 
And among such a 
crowd 
He has it pretty loud, 
For they are as musical as Chinese gongs. 
But when they advance, for a 
Mormon dance, 
He is filled with the greatest surprise, 
For they're sure to end the night 
With a 
Tabernacle fight, 
And scratch out one another's eyes.--Cnoans. 
There never was a 
home like Brigham Young's, 
So curious and so queer; 
If his joys are double, 
lie's a 
treble lots of trouble, 
And it gains on him year by year. 
Yet he sits in state, ami bears his fate, 
In a 
serve-me-very-right sort of way; 
If there's one wife to bury,_ 
There's another one to marry, 
And there's something goes wrong everyday.—Cno. 
Now if anybody envies Brigham Young, 
Let them go to the Great Salt Lake, 
And if they have leisure 
To examine their pleasure, 
They will find it's a 
great mistake. 
One wife at a 
time, so says my rhyme, 
Is enough for the proudest Don; 
So ere you strive 
To be lord of forty-five, 
Live happy,—if you can,—with one.—Cnoaus.

The roads of life are very rough 
From infancy to age; 
And Master Smith may prove a muff, 
And Master Jones a

But, whether you are Smith or Jones, 
It's quite as well to keep 
A 
good look out for broken bones, 
And " look before you leap." 
Then will your days, &e. 
Suppose you chance to cultivate 
A 
turn for married life, 
And think your funds are in a state 
To venture on a 
wife; 
I 
fear you'll find that wedded bliss 
Is very far from cheap, 
So my advice is simply this, 
To " look before you leap." 
Then will your days, &T. 
Suppose you lend a 
little cash, 
Or do a 
little bill, 
As people who are rather rash 
Occasionally will; 
If prudence ever takes a 
nap, 
And caution goes to sleep, 
You'll learn at last from that mishap 
To " look before you leap." 
Then will your days, &e.

Viii beat me in an inch of my life. 
I'm afraid for to go home dis evening, 
For I

Behind de door mit a

My \rife she is vaiting for me.

Oh! she looves me, I

Und I 
really ought happy to be, 
But behind de door now, mit big club 
My Katie vas vating for me. 
Her eyes, oh how shall I 
describe dem, 
Dey're like holes dat'vas burnt in a 
rag; 
Her nose looks as if it had busted, 
her mouth looks like a 
coffee bag, 
She says dat I 
often abuse her, 
But abused she vill never more be, 
So behind de door now mit a

Some fellas' think the Doves the spot 
For the creme de la creme, 
And crawl into the monkey house, 
To hear their brothers scream; 
While some declare that Belgrave Square, 
The Eden of the west, 
To meet with swells and dashing belles, 
But by Jove I 
know the best. 
CHORUS. 
Picadillie, for the elegant swells 
And I ' rest of belles; 
Picadillie, 
That s 
where I 
reside when in town. 
Some times I 
do a 
gentle crawl, 
By Jove I've gone that far, 
That I 
have nearly knocked against 
That horrid Temple Bar; 
Once I've hailed a 
Hansom cab, 
Hackman here, come here, 
Oh ! drive me home directly, 
Or by Jove to hail la queer. 
Picadillie, ac. 
Some time into the Burlington, 
Our cads a

Because a

Those common sot t

The dozy Beadle knows me there, 
As he walks up and down, 
He'll call me captain, touch his hat. 
That costs a 
half a 
crown. 
Picadillie, &c 
But tms butterfly existence. now 
With me will soon be past 
For Hymen soon will lead me in 
his sorrows fetters fast, 
I 
shall shortly pop the question, to 
The child of an 31. P— 
rim sure to be accepted, 
So it's all up with me.

BILLY JOHNSON'S BALL.—[CoNcLuDED.1 
There were the Jones-es-es, and the_Brown-es-es, 
And the Smith-es-es a 
score, 
The Spriggins-es, the Scoggins-es, 
And half a 
dozen more; 
In Billy's room, there wasn't room, 
To dance a 
decent jig, 
So he went and took a 
big one 
At " The Tinder-box and Pig." 
Spoken.—An efficient band was provided, consisting of a 
fiddle, 
a 
tin whistle, and a 
Jew's harp and they played—Cno. 
They introduced the baby, 
And we kissed it twice all round, 
Mrs. Johnson was quite "overcome," 
Fell fainting to the ground. 
But they " brought her to" with water, 
And " a 
drop of something in," 
And when " she felt herself again," 
The dancing did begin. 
Cuo. 
In and out and round about, 
Such a 
ball was never seen, 
And every now and then, 
We'd " a 
drop to drink between," 
Billy Johnson he got dancing 
With all the girls he'd find, 
Mrs. Johnson she grew jealous, 
And declared he was " unkind." 
Spoken.—I 
make it a 
rule never to interfere in family quarrels' 
so I 
chose a 
lovely creature in red and yellow, and we glided into 
the—Cno. 
I 
drank " love" to the Jones-es, 
I 
drank " love" to the Browns, 
I 
tried to keep on dancing, but 
'T-was somehow " ups and downs," 
To tell you how it ended, 
I 
really am not able, 
For I 
found myself next morning 
Lying underneath the table. 
Spoken.—I 
felt rather confused till a 
friend reminded me that 
I 
Lad been doing the— Ono.

SONG OF ALL SONGS. 
Words by PRANK VAN H ESS. 
Come listen now, a 
song I'll sing, I 
think ' twill please you quite 
I 
intend to string out in rhyme the songs you hear each night; 
The grave and gay, we'll shake them up, and spin thorn one by 
one, 
Quite curious they'll sound, no doubt, now listen as they run: 
There's " Don't you go, Tommy," because " l'm up a 
Tree," 
" 
Sunny days will come again," " I'm number One," you see. 
" 
I 
will stand by my Friend," I " Act on the Square," 
For the " Lancashire Lass," " Sweet Spirit, hear my Prayer." 
" 
It's nice to be a 
Father," " Rolling Home in the Morning, 
Boys." 
"The bloated young Aristocrat," he makes an awful noise. 
" 
When Sally comes Home, Won't I

MAN MIT AV 
ORT ON HIS NOSE. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
vonce loved a 
sweed girl named Lena, 
Und "you bet" she vas a 
beauty too, 
She vas cross-eyed, but den dot vas noting, 
Und her nose id vas all plack und pine; 
But den love vas plind to such trifles, 
I 
vas stone-plind den I 
subbose, 
For I 
soon found owl Lena had shook me, 
For a 
man mit a 
vort on his nose. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! vy did my gal ever leave me, 
Oh! vat vas de reason of dose; 
Oh I 
vy did my gal ever give me the shake 
For a 
man mit a 
vort on his nose. 
How id came aboud I 
will gwick tole you, 
Of you lisden to vot I 
viii say; 
To a 
bic-nic avay oud at Harlem, 
I 
dook Lena vone fine summer day; 
I 
left her to order some " Lager," 
For I'm fond of dot as you'd subbose, 
Yen I 
game back I 
found Lena kissing, 
A man mit a 
vort on his nose. 
Oh, vy did my gal, &c. 
Ven I 
saw me dot I 
got mad gwickly, 
Und I 
said—" Mister, vot do you mean ?" 
Und he said—" My dear sir, dot's my sweed heart, 
Who for fifdeen years I 
have not seen ;" 
Yen I 
found Lena vas so deceiving, 
I 
got grazy as yOu may subbose, 
Und I 
picked ub a 
stone und I 
fired id, 
Und I 
knocked off dot vort on his nose. 
Oh, vy did my gal, &de. 
THE FELLOW THAT PLAYED THE BANJO. 
I 
dare say you think now that strange it appears. 
To see a 
comedian who is nearly in tears; 
But when my sad story I 
pour in your ears, 
Perhaps you will pity my woes. 
It's on a 
young damsel I 
fondly did doat— 
No charmer more fairer than she. 
She fancied the stage, but could not sing a 
note, 
So she came to take lessons from me—do, to, mi. 
CHORUS. 
To music balls nightly this damsel would go, 
And listen to Robinson, who enchanted her so; 
But now she's got married, and lives in a 
place I 
don't know, 
With a 
fellow who plays the banjo. 
On hearing me sing the " Bohemian Swell," 
She head-over-ears in love with me fell. 
In less than three weeks she knew all her notes well, 
Such attention I 
to her had paid. 
All the new ladies' songs that were published I 
bought; 
I 
bought her stage properties new: 
For she by this time to perfection was brought, 
And soon was to make her debut. 
To music halls nightly, as. 
Now, I 
asked a 
young fellow I 
happened to know, 
He being rather clever upon the banjo; 
And as I 
to the country for a 
week had to go, 
To perform my town duties for me. 
lie promised, and I 
on my journey did start— 
Came back, and found to my dismay, 
That he with his banjo had so charmed her heart, 
That with him she skedaddled away. 
To music halls nightly, cto. 
I 
ne'er saw her more after that night— 
I 
ne'er saw her more, though I 
searched left and right. 
And I 
was laid up seven weeks through the fright, 
The news it so played on my nerves. 
As I 
was out strolling one very fine day, 
I 
turned round to hear music tones, 
Saw this chap with his banjo was tuning away, 
While my darling was shaking the " bones " 
To music halls nightly, &o. 
Against this young fellow a 
grudge I 
do owe— 
Ile did very wrong in serving me 80; 
And also a 
grudge against his banjo— 
And I 
hope it won't keep in tune. 
I 
hope, when he plays, that the bridge will break down 
And knock a 
big hole in the skin; 
And I 
also hope, when they go through the town, 
That they don't get one cent of tin. 
To music halls nightly, a.4.

After the opera's over, 
Belgravia could tell many tales,

I 
KNOW SOIKETRING. 
Written. Composed and sung by Gus Wirwa 
I 
know something which I 
don't mind telling you, 
But keep it a 
secret, now mind, 
Becourse off my wife was to find it out, too, 
I 
know that mit rage she'd go blind. 
It's about a 
young girl what I 
meet th'other day, 
While walking along in the street--
And I 
know off this young girl know'd I 
had a 
wife 
She wouldn't think I 
was so sweet. 
CH013.1.18. 
Now you know what I 
know, and what my wife don't know, 
She don't know what I 
know, and what I 
know you know, 
If you tell her what you know, and also what I 
know, 
Then she'd know what I 
know, what you know also. 
I 
know that this young girl wore lots of false hair, 
I 
could see dat at once at a 
glance, 
I 
know that her feet was much larger than mine, 
I 
found dat out when we did dance. 
She got beauty spots all over her face, 
I 
don't want to make fun at all, 
She'd a 
mole on her cheek as red as a 
beet, 
And it look'd like a 
big cod-fish ball. 
Now you know what I 
know, ctse. 
This girl's hair was red or a 
strawberry blonde, 
Her eyebrows hung down to her nose; 
She'd a 
mouth dat when open looked like a 
mouse- trap, 
It worked on a 
spring, I 
suppose. 
But still she's a 
beauty '
longside of my wife. 
To-raorrow I 
get a 
Divorce— 
And the secret is----well, I 
dont mind telling you--
I 
marry this young girl, of course.

know, ke.

MUM 
SCHOOLICASTER 
Old Teddy O'Rourke kept a 
bit of a 
school 
At a 
place called Clarina, and made it a 
rule, 
If the mind wouldn't mark, faith he'd soon mark the back, 
And he'd give them their own with a 
devilish crack. 
Bil3 scholars were: Jerry, Big Billy, and Ned, 
With Murrough M'Carthy, Old Darby, and Ted, 
Tall Dermot O'Clany, and Dennis O'Shea, 
Faith, all noble boys to drive learning away. 
Sroitm—Well, my boys, says old Ted, as you are all here. I'll just 
be calling !your names over, to see it any of ye are missing. Gerald 
AI'Shee.—I'in not here, sir.— Then where are you, ag-rah ?—I'm astride 
of the door, sir. ,—Then come in, and 
beat you, Corney °Flaherty, 
—I'm here, but my brother Barney ain't. —Then where is your brother 
Barney 7—Faith, sir, he's dead and they're going to wake him.—Poor 
fellow I I'm sorry he's gone home, for he was my own scholar; but do 
tau go and sit down, and don't fall asleep, or 11.1 be after waking you. 
So long life to old Teddy, 
For he's always ready, 
To kick up a 
row or the whiskey th smack; 
With his drinking and eating, 
His birching and beating, 
And. his hubaboo, philaloo, row de flow whack. 
Faith, Ted had a 
nose as big as a 
ton. 
And a 
chin, too! och honey, but they were all one; 
A grin, too, he had, and if there was a 
noise, 
He'd just give a 
squint and frighten the boys; 
A 
fortune he had, too :—his birch and his wig, 
A black, ugly cow, and an old dirty pig, 
A 
pratty plantation, a 
dog and a 
cat, 
And his head that he kept in an old greasy hat. 
SPOKEN.—Phelim O'Maheney, says he, one day, before you sit down, 
rand up, and say your alphabet, so keep your live fingers out of your 
head for a 
few minutes, and begin. 
What letter' 
i's that, sir 7-1 don't 
know, sir.—Arrah, botheration to you, what was it I 
said when I 
saw 
you blacking Pat Mooney's eye 7—Faith, sir, you said: Ah 1 
you big 
blackguard.—Well, never mind the blackguard, but say ah.—Ah.— 
Now, what letter's that 7—Faith, sir, I 
don't know, you ought to know 
better than me.—What makes the honey, and hold your NN hist 7—B.— 
That's a

half moon thing do you call

ask you what 
do I 
do with my eyesl—You ? you squint I—And what else, sir 7—You 
see. —That's a 
good boy. Now go on.—D-E-F-G-II.—Well, -why do you 
stop 7—Because I 
can't go on any further, sir.—What has your mother 
got at the corner of her nose 7—A pimple, sir.—Och, my service t'ye, 
sir; and what else', —One eye.—Devil take you, and don't be getting 
into figures now. Say I, without the one,—I, without the one.—What's 
the next 7—It's something. sir, but I 
don't know what.— W

GIVE A MAN A CHANCE. 
Words and Music by J. Batchelder. 
Pm tir'd of offering advice, 
So will the subject change, 
And try a 
song of different stamp. 
A title far from strange; 
So, while I 
strive to do my best, 
At me pray take a 
glance, 
Just lend your sympathizing ears, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
CHORUS. 
So always, boys, act fair and square, 
Accept what fortune grants, 
And don't be over critical, 
But give a 
man a 
chance. 
It's anything but proper, 
On a 
couple to intrude, 
To spoil a 
fellow making love, 
is very, very rude ; 
Don't interrupt their tete-a-teto, 
By making an advance, 
But walk a 
mile another way, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, etc. 
Suppose a 
fellow can't stump up 
Twenty shillings in the pound, 
Perhaps if breathing time be given, 
The needful will be found; 
Hay to him, " Well, 
wait a 
bit," 
Think of this circumstance; 
And if you don't press over hard, 
You give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, e 
c. 
My song perhaps, may not please you, 
But to do so is my aim; 
To meet your kind approval is 
The summit of my fame; 
But if you do not quite agree 
With what I 
now advance, 
Just be as lenient as you can, 
And give a 
man a 
chance. 
So always, boys, act fair and square, 
Accept what fortune grants, 
And don't be over critical, 
But give a 
man a 
chance.

JUST SUCH A BOOK AS 
WEBSTER'S 
PRACTICAL LETTER- 
BITER 
HAS LONG BEEN NEEDED, 
As most works of the kind were either too verbose, or too trite, tame and 
Inelegant. 
This book hits the happy medium of just suiting the present 
time, and it furnishes examples of every style worthy of imitation, or of being 
copied. 
It is fast superseding all the antiquated Letter-Writers that have 
long outlived their usefulness. 
So gi eat is the sale of this excellent book that 
it may truly be said that since its publication, 
" 
Those write now who never wrote before, 
And those who always wrote, now write the more." 
Webster's Practical Letter-Writer 
CONTAINS 
General Directions for Writing; 
also, Model Letters—Family Letters, 
Children's Letters, Letters of Friendship, Letters of Sympathy, Love 
Letters, Soldier's Letters, Letters of Distinguished Men, Letters of Dis-
ting-uished Women, Letters of Distinguished Authors, Business Letters, 
Letters of Introduction. Miscellaneous Letters, and Model Notes of Invi-
tation. 
Together with Bible Quotations. Choice Prose Sentiments, Select 
Poetical Quotations; also a 
Copious Dictionary of Synonyms, all the 
Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian Words and Phrases usually met 
with; a 
full List of Abbreviations, Mottoes of the States, and a 
Model 
of Printer's Proof Corrections. 
***This book contains 200 pages, bound in boards, with splendid illumi-
nated cover, making the most complete, most perfect, most elaborate, most 
useful, most entertaining, and yet simple Letter-Writer ever produced.
