I: 
[1.26.35] All right. Well, we have today, Mare M, doing an interview about her work as a personal care 
worker. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And, Mare, thank you for doing this with us. 
P: 
You’re very welcome. 
I: 
We’re really excited about being able to talk with you about your work, and I think we’re going to just 
jump right in, and I’m going to ask you just to tell us a little bit about your history as a personal care assistant. 
And I’m calling it a personal care assistant right now or a PCA, but you might refer to it—I know you were 
talking about being a caregiver, and you use different language. 
P: 
Yes [1.26.00]. 
I: 
And I do want to talk about the language, but can you just give us your history as a personal care 
worker or as a caregiver, and how you got into this work, and why you do it, and what it means to you? 
P: 
Okay. I lived in Tennessee for 10 years, and when I was there I found a place where I really felt 
comfortable, and there was a large population of the group that was elderly [1.25.29], and I just absolutely fell 
in love with these [laughing] people just to the point where I wanted to do anything that I could to help them 
and make them happy. And so, one of my friends and I would go and take on dates, and we’d go do activities 
together because typically she didn’t go out. And so, it made me very happy, and my friend, S, she would tell 
me, “Hey. You know, have you thought of this? Have you thought of—hey, let’s go to this.” And so, she kind of 
set me into this mind of serving, and I was just absolutely happy. Just blissfully happy, and she kept showing 
me and teaching me how to be of service to people even when they didn’t know they needed it [1.24.45]. And 
the people at the community that I was belonging to were, “Hey, you need to just, you know, be love; be 
everything that you are.” And it just seemed to make sense. So, when I moved up here I had a really difficult 
adjustment period, and I didn’t know what to do, and I didn’t know what I wanted to do. So, I went to what I had 
been taught, and I applied for a position as a caregiver, and I was meaning to go for one company [laughs], 
and I ended up contacting my employer now—which is Home Instead, and love working for them. I went to the 
interview, and I hit it off really well with the lady, and within I’d say 2 or 3 days they had me working. And I had 
several clients. I had people that I—they give you training. Every quarter you get to go and get more training, 
and so I’ve done the Alzheimer’s Training. I’ve done How to Deal with Depression as a Caregiver, which is 
something that you wouldn’t really think about, but burnout can happen, and it can cause great emotional 
distress. So, they also will make sure like, for example, you get TB-tested, and all of these things that you 
wouldn’t think about typically. So, when I started doing the [1.23.25] the caregiving, I kind of got a little bit of a 
shock because I got put into things that I’d never experienced before. And it doesn’t really bother me when I 
get surprised, it’s just how can I solve this? How can I make this easier? And so, I’ve actually become very 
good friends with one of my clients to the point where I go and hang out with her. We go to coffee and stuff, 
and another one of my clients that contacts me every once in a while, and says, “Hey, how’s it going?” And I 
really like the personal relationships that I’ve built because of my job. And I love what I do because it’s not only 
service, but I get paid for it, which is even cooler, but I would do it without getting paid for it. As much as I’d be 
[laughing] broke, I would still do it. 
I: 
How long have you been doing it? 
P: 
Well, I’ve taken care of people since I was little [1.22.25]. I just—like my brothers. You know, I would 
take care of them and stuff like that, so I’ve been doing it all my life, but actually getting paid for it as an 
occupation, I’d say probably the last 2 years, 3 years, and I love it. I don’t really want to do anything else. 
I: 
So, expand on—you say you love it, what in particular appeals to you about it?

P: 
Well, it’s the service that when I go into someone’s home and particularly, like, I love my favorite client. 
I won’t lie, she’s my [laughing] favorite. She has this cat, and this cat was getting kind of tubby, and so I 
suggested a diet change and a modification of that, and now she’s getting slender of hip again. And that cat 
adores me. She lets me rub her belly, which she doesn’t let anybody else do that. And my friend just thinks it’s, 
you know, she’s just thrilled to death that this cat loves me. I can take care of her house, and I get very 
frustrated when other people don’t see it as their own because when you’re going into someone’s home, you 
are their body. You are their—you do what they can’t [1.21.18], so she can’t sweep her floors. She drops a pill, 
she can’t take that pill. So, she can’t just, you know, randomly go into her pill bottles and find it because her 
hands don’t do what they’re supposed to do. And so, I have to go in and do that cat box. She can’t get down—
she’s in a chair, so she can’t get down and do cat boxes. And I love the aspect of being able to help her, and to 
get her to live in the kind of house that I would want. You know, clean house with everything taken care of 
that’s what I want for that, so I love that aspect. I love being able to help them to a point where they are 
satisfied with their life and that it’s not weird or they have to be like, “Hey, can you?” [Laughs] you know, so she 
has very particular [1.20.29] things that she likes. Like her blinds closed when you walk in the door, and you 
know, likes to watch the evening news and then go to bed. And [laughing] it’s—she’s very particular about what 
she does. 
I: 
How long have you been caring for her? 
P: 
Over a year. 
I: 
Okay. And it sounds like you’ve gotten to know her particular values and idiosyncrasies and daily 
habits. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And how did you discover those things? It sounds like you are very intentional about approaching it with 
sort of like with the Golden Rule, right? 
P: 
Oh, well, I try to live that anyways because like I have a super hero cape. I really do. It was made as a 
gift for me [1.19.50], and when they had the objection—have like humans for empowerment has—it’s a group 
that I have on Facebook that I love, and I put inspirational things in that, and things that’ll help people be 
motivated. So, I try—on the back of it, it has LTN, which means love thy neighbor, and that is what I try to do, 
and what I try to bring to my job, and what I try to bring to my neighborhood. So, when I started learning things 
about her, I just talked to her. You know, most caregivers they come in, they do what they’re supposed to do or 
not. [Laughing] some of them don’t, but you know, you learn because you ask questions. How do you prefer 
this? She likes to have her coffee, for example, nobody else makes her coffee. So, I will—she got a Keurig for 
Christmas, and I will put in there—she takes two ice cubes, she takes this much cream in the bottom of it, and 
she gets it with the dark coffee. That’s her favorite, and I make her these when I come, and it’s like—it’s like 
our bonding moment, you know.  And she’s in a—when I transfer her from her chair to her bed, there’s a point 
where the Hoyer lift hits—where her buttocks hit the bed, and at that very precise moment, she just gets this 
look of bliss on her face, and so I will slow—when I had both hands to use—I will slow it down so that moment 
is extended as long as possible because that’s her favorite part of the day [1.18.14]. And I want to make sure 
that she has that enjoyment because she looks at her walls a lot, and if I can make that a little brighter—if I can 
make that a little better, that’s completely worth it to me.  
I: 
A lot of people are curious about what exactly does a personal care worker, or a caregiver do? You 
know, I don’t think they understand just what a typical day for you providing caregiving looks like.  
P: 
My husband doesn’t even know [laughing] what I do. He doesn’t understand. Well, for example when I 
go to her house, if I’m the 3-hour-shift person in the morning, that means that I have to not only get her up, get 
her dressed, get her breakfast, get her lunch made so that way after I leave she’s able to have her lunch, and

she likes to sleep late. And when you are physically compromised, you’re at everybody else’s mercy. If they 
say they’re going to be there at 7 o’clock whether you want to get up or not [1.17.09], you get up at 7 o’clock. 
And [laughing] I’m trying to stay focused on the question here, but if I’m the 3-hour-block person, then there’s a 
certain series that you have to do. If I’m the 1-hour-block person, that means that I’m there to set up the thing 
for the other person, so that way they have, for example, her brief or they have her clothes set out or they have 
the Hoyer lift in the right place or they have her urinal bottle set so that way they don’t have to do anything 
other than the tasks at hand. I try to make sure that that’s a smooth transition for them. As far as, yeah, as far 
as that goes, when I had both of my hands and I was able to do all of that, when I’d come in knowing that she 
liked to sleep late, I would get all of the floors swept, I would get them mopped, I would get the bathroom 
cleaned, I would get the dishes done if there was any left over, clean the cat box, get all the chores out of the 
way so that way when she was ready to get up I would be able to focus on that. And sometimes picking an 
outfit [1.15.58] that maybe she wouldn’t put together, and say, hey, what do you think about trying something a 
little brave? Let’s go this direction. What do you think? And she would—sometimes she’d dig her heels in, and 
say, “No, I’m not gonna do that.” Oh, come on. You can do it and encouraging her to try different things. Like 
she rarely got to go out with any of the caregivers, and so we would go to the Biggby’s. They have buy one get 
one frees, and so we’d go up to the coffee shop and we’d take turns buying coffee for each other. And that was 
just something we did before my shift, so that was just as friends, and she thought that that was just the cat’s 
meow. And so, it really depends on what she needs for the day, but particularly she’s kind of systematic in 
what she likes. I make her grocery list for her or we take turns molesting the cat. That’s what we call it. It’s like, 
hey, let’s molest the kitty, and you know, we’ll chase her around and get her to come up in the cat—she loves 
it, so [laughs] we’re not really—we’re just playing with her, you know, stuff. But then if I go to another one of my 
clients, the first thing that I would do is greet his puppy because he just let him out to go potty, and then I get 
the dishes set up. Throw out all the trash. Take out the trash. After the dishes would get done, then I’d go down 
and do the sweep and mop of the floor, go down and get laundry started if he needed it, make sure the floors 
get vacuumed, clean the bathroom, and then I would sit with him and talk about and bring him his lunch, bring 
him his water, whatever he needed because he couldn’t stand up without falling over. So, getting him 
transferred into his wheelchair or making sure that I was there to supervise him while he was moving around, 
that was very helpful. If he needed errands run [1.14.08], I would do those for him. Going to the grocery store 
and picking up things on sale, and taking his dog for a walk, or going to the bank, or whatever he needed to 
have done. And then we’d sit there and watch the news together or whatever he wanted to talk about, and he 
did have some different views from mine, and he was kind of vocal [laughing] about that. And— 
I: 
How did you handle that? 
P: 
Well, [sigh] 
I: 
I mean can you give us some examples? 
P: 
Well, he liked to use the N word, and he liked to defend his views on that, and the first time like—I wear 
Black Lives Matter [laughing] on my wrist, so the first time he said that I was like, dude, you know, that’s not 
kosher. You can’t talk like that. And he went off on this tangent about, this is blah, blah, blah, and this is. And I 
was like, you know, if he want’s to be that way, that’s him. And I can’t say I love you if I’m judging that, so I set 
it aside and I let it down, and I know that he had just lost his son, and so that was really hard for him, and 
sometimes he’d just start crying. And I’d just hug him, you know, we’re not supposed to be like super physical, 
but I just, you know, I’d say, do you need a hug? And he’d agree, and so I just I’d hug him because sometimes, 
especially since that made him by himself. That left him alone in his house [1.12.37], and I just felt so much 
compassion for him because I know what that feels like to be that lonely, and so that allows me to have a 
relationship different than I’m guessing other caregivers have, but if they’re anything like me then they probably 
feel that [laughing] same compassion for these people that have different lives than we do, and they live 
differently. That’s just how life is.

I: 
So, you mentioned that there are differences between caregivers, but you talk about being drawn to this 
because you love to serve, and you have compassion for these people, and so I’m guessing that that draws 
you into a personal relationship where the boundaries get a little fuzzy between, you know, what you’re there 
for professionally, and then the personal— 
P: 
Umm-- 
I: 
--friendships that develop? 
P: 
I don’t think so because first and foremost like I said, I’m their body, and so those things have to be 
done, and that’s my responsibility. And the rest of it is kind of like icing on the cake. I mean I don’t call ‘em up 
out of the blue and say, hey, what’s shakin’? Because that wouldn’t maintain that boundary, so it is a fine line. I 
agree with that, but my favorite client, what can I say? You know, if she needs me then—when she was having 
difficulties with her stomach, she would call me [1.11.04] up and say, “I have been sick.” And what she meant 
by that was can you come and change me? And if I was available, oh, yeah, you know. I lived a short distance 
from her, so I’d say, well, all right. Not my favorite thing to do and can’t really deal with that very well. Have had 
physical reactions to [laughing] that before. It’s like whoa, doggy. And I’m joining in the activities, so [laughing] 
but that’s one of the things that actually—that’s the kind of bond, but it’s not, hmm—there is a boundary there 
that I don’t cross. I don’t, you know, she’ll ask me what should I do about this? And like, well, what do you want 
to do about that? Let’s look at your options. Let’s see what you’ve got, and so I try not to impose—I mean I 
can’t help being who I am, but I don’t want them to feel like their views are wrong or that they are incorrect just 
because I don’t agree with them doesn’t mean anything. So, there is—there’s a lot of things I don’t say 
[1.09.54]. 
I: 
Well, I’m wondering, too, because you do work for an agency. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And agencies have policies— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--and procedures, and I’m guessing that you get a plan of care, some instructions on what— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--services you’re supposed to be assisting with— 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--providing, and it must be a little difficult to sort of stick to that list that’s in black and white on paper. 
P: 
Well, that’s the minimum. Like on his, for example, I’m using these two particular clients because 
they’re like [laughing] night and day. But on his it’s very specific about you need to have this, this, this, and this. 
Well, that’s the black and white of it, and the black and white of it is just the basic being their body part. But as 
far as the emotional support, I can’t imagine losing a child. I can’t, you know, I mean I have, but not from his 
perspective [1.08.58], so if he needs to talk about it, that’s another part of my job, but that’s not the black and 
white. That’s more towards the gray, and that’s only if he brings it up, only if he wants to talk about it. That’s 
there. That’s the gray part of my job, but the black and white is the stuff that has to be done. You know, do the 
laundry, do the dishes, do the floors, do the dog walking, do the errands, that’s what I’m there for. But the rest 
of it is where, you know, you have to have a rapport with the people. You’re going into their homes. You know, 
you’re seeing their dirty laundry. You’re seeing the way that they live, the way that they are, and the reflection 
of themselves in what they’re doing. So, it’s—the gray area is more of the emotional support I think, and I 
really—I love to do that part of the job just as much as I like doing the dishes, and I like doing the floors, and I 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Marilyn Martell-Stotler. Grand Rapids.  4.25.18

like making things right for them so that way they don’t have to worry about that. That’s done. It’s over with. It’s 
good. 
I: 
Explain some of the physical needs. You mentioned a Hoyer lift. For those who haven’t heard that term 
before, can you explain? 
P: 
My insurance guy had never heard of it. He had to look it up on the Internet [1.07.42]. Well, there’s 
several different kinds. There’s two particular—Hoyer’s like Q-tip. If you say Q-tip, it could be a cotton swab 
from, you know, CVS or something, but everybody calls ‘em Q-tips because that’s it. And the Hoyer’s the same 
way. It could be made by somebody else, and what it does is—one that I commonly use it has feet that go like 
this at the bottom of it, and then it has a pole that goes up and curves over. Sorry. It curves over, and then it 
has a swiveling handle that comes down, and it has two bars that come off of it like this. So, essentially it looks 
like this [laughs]. Does that make sense? Okay. I know that’s kind of vague for—I’m a hand talker, so it’s 
different. And what that does is it has a sling, and you place it underneath your client, and you crisscross the 
legs because otherwise they’ll end up looking like a frog with their legs all splayed out. That’s not comfortable 
at all [1.06.39], so you make sure that those get crossed over, and that keeps them secure. And then the top 
one where the arms go, supports their back, and you lift them up with the handle, and then you move that 
Hoyer lift so that way you can either take them from their chair to the bed or from the bed to the chair or into 
the shower chair. It helps with the transfer for people that don’t have the mobility to stand up. It’s very easy to 
do, but you have to have two people there in case the Hoyer decides to fall over while you have a client in it or 
if you slip your hand [laughing] and you injure yourself because the grip slipped. But the Hoyer is crucial to 
people that don’t have the standing ability or the mobility level. The Gait belt is the other one. It goes around 
their waist, and it allows you to hold onto them and help move them without—those are the ones that are 
capable of doing. Another example of the Hoyer is the standing one where they put their hands in it, and with 
your assistance they can pull themselves up, and then you can do your transfers that way, especially if they 
can shuffle their feed, you can get them moved pretty easily [1.05.24]. So, that’s three different examples of 
helping with the transfers using tools that are crucial for the job. 
I: 
So that sounds like a really [laughing] critical task that you provide to get somebody from the chair to 
the bed or to the toilet seat or the shower, and then you give them a shower. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
These all seem like sort of pivotal tasks that you do that allows somebody to be at home, and that can 
either—you can either—it’s kind of dangerous. You can either hurt them or yourself or you keep them— 
P: 
Yeah [laughing]. 
I: 
--safe, and, right? 
P: 
Yes. Otherwise, I mean for she or he, both of them would be stuck in their beds. They wouldn’t be able 
to go. They wouldn’t be able to get in the chair. They wouldn’t be able to go to coffee with me, for example, or 
they wouldn’t be able to go to the grocery store, if they didn’t have the Hoyer. It wouldn’t allow them to do that, 
so knowing how to do that—I’ve trained several people on how to do it, and showed them, you know, this is 
how you can arrange this so that way makes it easier for you, makes it easier for them, and it’s a matter of kind 
of doing a rolling when they’re laying down [1.04.05] or when they’re sitting up you have to tuck it all the way 
down, and you know, it gets a little complicated, but once you get the hang of it—but I had to learn that 
[laughing] pretty fast. 
I: 
It sounds like any one of these tasks whether it’s transferring somebody or showering somebody, if you 
know how to do it you can really help somebody. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. I wish I would have had more training to do it. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Marilyn Martell-Stotler. Grand Rapids.  4.25.18

I: 
But if you don’t know how to do it, things could go south, right? 
P: 
Oh, yeah [laughs]. Easy. I’ve had people that have come in that had never seen a Hoyer. Never used it; 
never had any experience, and while I was teaching them, they were blown away. They were—“This is 
complicated.” [Laughing] and it is, but training, training, training, training, training. That’s important—crucial 
[1.03.18]. 
I: 
How are we doing? 
I2: 
Great. I’m just going to change batteries. 
I: 
Okay. Cool. 
I2: 
And go to the next one. 
I: 
So that was 26 minutes. That’s what I had. 
I2: 
Yeah. I just stopped that, but it would tell me a similar time. 
I: 
You’re doing great. 
P: 
Thank you. I hope I’m giving— 
I: 
Yeah. 
P: 
--really answering the questions. 
I: 
Beautiful. 
P: 
Sometimes it’s hard for me to stay focused [1.02.49] because I get so excited about [laughing] what I’m 
doing, so. 
I: 
Yeah, but your passion’s coming through, which is good. So, we’re gonna move into a set of questions 
about, you know, particular—I know you told me some stories on the phone the other day. That kind of blew 
me away, too, like the one about the—a situation that you were in that you didn’t feel prepared for.  
P: 
Oh, yeah. 
I: 
You [inaudible] the floor, and you weren’t sure what to do. 
P: 
That was a meltdown situation [laughing]. 
I: 
Yeah. So, you could tell that story. That’d be cool. 
P: 
Yeah, and the fact that I would have gotten paid the exact same amount as what I get paid for doing the 
easier ones. 
I: 
Right. So, let’s talk about some specific, you know, things that have happened. Like things that were 
difficult or challenging or you were afraid, or you felt threatened or whatever, but then the job conditions like the 
wages. 
P: 
Oh, geez, yeah. 
I: 
C, you wanted to say something? 
I2: 
Yes. I wanted to say that a big part of this project is us humanizing PCAs. There’s a lot of people in 
society who make this world go. Geriatric care is a big part of it -but a lot of people in your field aren’t, you 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Marilyn Martell-Stotler. Grand Rapids.  4.25.18
6
know, heroes on Saturday Night Live or, you know, so anyways, what is effective in humanizing PCAs is 
relatable stories. And when you were talking about the story of how one of—do you call them clients or? 
P: 
Yeah. I call them clients because I don’t want to use their names. 
I2: 
Yeah. Great. 
P: 
[Laughing] you know— 
I2: 
We don’t want that either, so one of your clients was using the N word, how you navigated that really 
difficult social situation, that’s something that someone can like think about and relate to and imagine how 
difficult it would be in that—it is a complaint of your job [1.00.43] that many other people would never have 
thought about. So, that kind of anecdotal stuff is very helpful for our purposes. Would you agree? 
I: 
Yeah. Absolutely. 
I2: 
Is that your phone? 
P: 
That’s my husband. 
I2: 
May I put it on silent? 
P: 
Yeah. 
I2: 
I am ready to go whenever you are. 
P: 
Yes. Quit bothering me. I love you. You’re wonderful. My husband. 
I2: 
Do you recycle batteries? 
P: 
Yes. They do. You can set ‘em on the cabinet, and I’ll put ‘em away. 
I: 
I might circle back to that story, and that would be a good one to segue into other situations that you’ve 
had to figure out how to deal with, you know, on the spot. 
I2: 
I totally agree, and I am ready whenever. 
P: 
I’m putting myself on do-not-distrub. I’m the Bluetooth. For whatever reason it’s still does that. 
I: 
Actually, C, would you just throw this somewhere else. Just in case something goofy happens with it. 
I2: 
Oh, yeah. May I put it right here? 
I: 
Yeah. I just wanted to get it out of earshot. 
I2: 
Oh, yeah, yeah. 
I: 
In case it makes some weird noise. 
I2: 
Oh, I get it. Oh, yeah. It’s amazing. These are very directional mics, so even me turning around and 
doing that is taking sound out, so I’m really excited about it. I’m just nerding out, sorry. 
P: 
[Laughing] you nerd out all you need to. 
I2: 
[Laughing] all right. I’m going to start this one, and I’m going to start recording here, and we are ready 
for you. 
I: 
Okay. Mare, I want to circle back to a story you told just a few minutes ago about a client of yours who 
has some values that you don’t share.

P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And uses some language that you find offensive. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
And I’m curious about being a personal care worker or a caregiver in somebody’s home, you’re there 
alone. It’s not like you can call for assistance or—and you can’t just say, “Sorry. I’m outta here,” right? 
P: 
[Laughing] yeah. 
I: 
You have a job to do. So, how do you do that? How do you handle a situation like that? How did you 
negotiate that one? 
P: 
Well, other than my blood boiling [laughs], that was very—it caught me off guard because I tend to 
hang around with the Amen Corner, like we all do. We want people that are going to reflect back what we feel, 
and when you’re going into somebody else’s home and they are not reflecting back what you feel, that is first of 
all shocking because I wasn’t sure that I heard what he said, and so I inquired [57.48]. I was like why would 
you feel that way? I want to know. I want to understand because that helps me to understand him, and so he 
went off on a pretty good tangent about this and that, and I said, but this also happens in this particular one, 
and that was disregarded. I was completely—so I thought about it for about oh I’d say a good 5 minutes. I just 
kept my mouth shut because I am very passionate [laughing] about things that—I feel very strongly about 
them, and so I have a tendency to be rather combative about things, but when you’re going into somebody’s 
home, you just can’t. You can’t make them feel less than human, and I—that was very difficult to deal with, but 
by the time he had finished his rant and everything, and I just said, well, I’m afraid we’re gonna have to just 
leave that one alone because I can’t feel the same way. And I left it at that, and even though he would bring it 
up periodically when there was a news story that corresponded with or went against what he believed, he 
would comment very adamantly about that, and I’d say nothing because you can’t educate somebody who 
does not wish to: a) make changes, does not what to be different than they are, who feels just as passionate 
about what they do—how they believe as I do about what I believe. So, I just, I can’t. You just have to let ‘em 
be who they are because whether I agree or not he’s still a human, and he’s still struggling, and he’s still trying 
to do what I’m doing. And so, that’s happened to me a few times at different places where their values—one 
was very much a shopper, so a lot of money was spent, and that is beyond my skill level. I’m not poor, but I’m 
not rich either, and so I can go to the store every once in a blue moon, but this was like every day things, and 
just closets full of stuff, and that blew me away. I just couldn’t, and there were things with tags on it, and things 
that were brand new that had never been touched, and I was baffled by that. Like, how could you? If I buy 
something, I’m gonna wear it until it’s [laughing], you know, until it’s thread bare. Until like my pants break 
through at the seams or whatever, but the different lifestyles that you walk into. Not only do you have to mind 
your own manners, but you also have to mind your speech, you have to mind what you’re saying to them 
because knowing that he feels—going back to this guy—knowing that he feels [54.53] this negative towards 
people of color, and knowing that I’m going to face that, that helps me to understand a lot more of what should 
I not talk about. It helped me, but I had to learn that by default [laughing], you know, when he comes up and 
says, you know, the N word, or he says, “That this is, you know, because they do this, or if they would just 
work,” and I’m thinking, dude [laughs], you’re not working either. So, [laughing] you’re not seeing where your 
common ground is, and I just let it be what it is. I can’t do anything else than that, so that’s complicated when 
you’re meeting people with different values. 
I: 
So, one aspect of the work is that you walk into these homes not knowing exactly what you’re getting 
into, what the people are going to be like, and you have to learn, and I’m sure walk into other situations—
unexpected situations where you have to respond. 
P: 
Oh, yeah.

I: 
And I would like to throw out just a few like potential situations, and ask you if you’ve ever experienced 
them or— 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And if so, how you responded. How you feel about it. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
So, for example, have you every walked into a house and encountered a client that had some physical 
needs or social or emotional or mental needs going on that you did not feel prepared to handle? 
P: 
Oh, oh [laughing] yeah. One of my very first clients that they sent me out to—well, the first one that I 
went out to was real easy. He was grocery shopping. Take him out and it was great, and he was very pleasant. 
But the next one that they sent me out to was a total care patient, and I say patient because I’m really kind of 
baffled why this person was not in a care facility, and whatever reason it was to a point where you had to pick 
her nose with a tissue that had been twisted a certain amount of times. You had to clean her ears, but only this 
part, and only in this direction, and only this way. And you had to brush her teeth, but you had to make sure 
that you did three on each tooth [52.23], and you had to comb her hair a specific way. You had to put drops in 
her eyes, and you had to make sure that her lips were moistened, and it was just—it was incredibly intense, 
and I was kind of—there was like two pages of things that you had to accomplish during this 2-hour shift. And it 
was step-by-step, but there wasn’t any supporting, so it would say like you have to clean her nose, but it 
wouldn’t tell you how. So, you had to have—the girl that was training me was like you have to twist the tissue x 
amount of times, and she set up this entire platform with things that would have to be used during the care of 
this particular patient, and I just—by the time I left I was just—I mean when we even transferred her into the 
bed, she had to have this pillow wrapped up this many times set here; this pillow this way; this drink had to be 
right here. This had to—and I—no, nope, nope, nope, nope. I left there, and I immediately called my work, and 
I said, no! No, no, no. I’m crying. I’m upset. I am flabbergasted.  Now, I didn’t react at all while I was doing this 
because: a) I don’t want her to feel bad, b) you know, I’m trying to learn, and by the time I had gotten to c) I 
was see ya later [laughing]. I just—I could not—I could not give the amount of care that was needed because I 
did not have the training, and I was expected to be there for the one evening, and then the next night I was 
supposed to do it solo. And I, no. No, no, no. That particular client would have to have far more training then, 
“Hey, guess what you’re doin’.” That was terrifying. I called my mom up after I’d called my job, and I said I don’t 
know if this is for me. I don’t know if I can do this because this is way more than I expected, and my mom said, 
“You know what, give it a chance with another client. You know, let it be. I’m really sorry that you had to deal 
with this.” Like I went from that person’s house to my mom’s house, and my husband was in bed, that’s why 
[laughs]. So, I come over to my mom’s. I’m like, mom! She’s like, “it’ll be okay. You know, just be patient. You’ll 
find what you need to do,” and after that I’ve not been asked to go back there [49.40]. And that gave me a 
sense of relief because my employer was not only listening to me and my needs but was also—I mean the lady 
liked me well enough. I’m rather personable, I guess [laughs], but she liked me well enough, but as far as the 
care level, that was way beyond my skills. And the pay level for that was the same as any other client, and that 
blew my mind. That just, no. That’s way past that pay scale. That should have been easy $20 an hour [laughs] 
for her, easy, because of all of the work that involved in getting her ready for bed and into bed.  
I: 
Have you ever walked into a situation or had an emergency occur where you didn’t know what to do? 
P: 
Uh, yeah [laughs]. Actually, with my favorite client. She had been feeling a little under the weather, and 
I noticed that she was—she’s typically talkative with me. You know, we have good conversations, and we talk 
about a lot of different things. But she was getting more quiet, and she’d been that way for a couple of days, 
and I’d see her every day, so you know, it kind of became more noticeable by the time the third day roles 
around. And I went in there for the morning shift and she was looking at me, she had regurgitated, and it was

Marilyn Martell-Stotler. Grand Rapids.  4.25.18

all over her face and all over her nightgown, so I got her all cleaned up and everything. And then I touched her 
skin, and hokey toot, like she was burning up, and like I’m not really sure what to do here. So, I called my work, 
and I said this is what’s going on. This is what’s happening. What do I do? And they’re like, “Well, does she 
seem coherent?” I was like barely. She’s not herself at all. So, I ended up calling 911. They brought her there. 
It turns out that she had a wicked infection that was playing havoc on her, and when she’s in her bed, by 
herself, she doesn’t have anybody there. She had to wait until I got there in the morning, and I walked into that. 
And so, it was, you know, I got her cleaned up enough, and the ambulance came and took her away, and that 
ends my shift. You know, ‘cause I’ve already done the chores, and so I had to wait. But I’ve also been in a 
situation where the nurse was there, and she had a medical device that basically kept blood flowing to a wound 
that she had [47.11]. And when the gentleman took—the nurse took the apparatus off, there was this strand 
that was just kind of hanging out there. And I was like, dude, what is that? And he’s like, “I don’t know. I’ve 
never seen that before,” and so we kind of pondered, but it looked like a vein. And so, I know [laughs]. It was 
pretty gruesome at the time, but you know, I’d never seen anything like that. The worst I’ve ever seen is like a 
kid scabbing his knee or something. You know, I’d never seen anything like that, and he hadn’t as a nurse. So, 
you know, this was pretty intense situation, and so he called his boss and he’s like, “I don’t know what this is.” 
Sends pictures, sends videos, and they were like, “Send her to the hospital. That looks like it could be a vein 
that got pulled out by the vacuum.” And so, we sent her away. It turned out it was a blood clot that had come 
out, but still that was—I was like [laughing], crap. This is beyond my skill level, here, but that was back, you 
know, almost towards the beginning when that occurred. And, yeah, now it’s much better, by the way. Her 
wound is healed, almost, so [laughs], but that was scary because I’d never seen anything like that. And if 
you’re looking at wound care for stuff they, you know, have nurses come in, and they take care of the medical 
side. But the non-medical side, that’s—you get to witness a lot of really cool stuff [laughing] that you never 
would see. I would never have put myself, you know, checking out something like that, but it was really cool, 
and really gross at the same time. And, yeah, it was a lot of different, but they don’t prepare you for that. You 
know, when you think of caregiving, you don’t really think of what happens if. It’s just, well, we’ll fly by the seat 
of our pants and hope we can make it through the day without, you know, [laughing] killing anybody. That’s 
kind of—that’d be a good thing. You know, as long as we make it alive we’re good. So, I hope that answered 
that [laughing]. 
I: 
Yeah. Those are great examples. What about—have you ever faced sexually inappropriate behavior? 
P: 
Mmm, not— 
I: 
Or words or jokes or, you know, things that made you uncomfortable? 
P: 
Well, kind of, but mostly it’s another one of those things that—I’ll be like, dude. You know, that’s my go-
to-phrase by the way [laughs]. Everybody’s a dude—male, female. I’m really—I’m a kid of the 80s, so you 
know, the dude was what you called everybody, and so that’s my go-to. Gender neutral as far as I’m 
concerned. And so, I’m like, dude, that’s not kosher. You know, don’t do that. That’s not cool. And mostly if I 
get approached [44.18] with things that are directly at me, they can talk in general, you know, they might crack 
a joke, general. I don’t—I’m not easily offended, but if it’s gonna be directed directly at me, then I will say no. 
I’m afraid you’re gonna have to do that, but I also would talk to my work and tell them, hey, this isn’t—you 
know, I don’t feel comfortable with this. I don’t feel safe with this. You’re gonna have to have a backup person 
here, and they have actually been very accommodating for things like that. If I’m feeling threatened or if I’m 
feeling bad, they’ll either remove me from that place or I will have a companion that will go with me to these 
clients’ houses. And so, that’s reassuring that my employer trusts me enough to know that I’m not gonna be, 
you know, feeding them a line. That I’m going to be telling them, hey, this is an unsafe situation, and 
sometimes—not with me, but I have heard tales where clients have actually been dropped because if they’re 
going to continuously harass people like that, then that’s not allowed. You’ve got to be working in a symbiotic 
relationship, otherwise it can’t proceed. You just can’t work in a situation where you’re gonna feel threatened.

I: 
So, have you ever walked into a situation where there’s—you know there’s a client there that you need 
to take care of, but you arrive and there’s, you know, dogs or other family members or things that you weren’t 
aware of— 
P: 
[Laughs] 
I: 
--kind of before you got there, and then you felt you weren’t sure what to do or how to handle it? 
P: 
I typical am animal-friendly, so I have a menagerie at my house right now. So, animals don’t bug me. 
You know, even if it was a little bit more of an aggressive dog, typically within probably 5 to 10 minutes the 
animal is relaxed with me enough to be hanging out with me, and you know, hey, how’s it goin’ buddy. You 
know, they just feel comfortable around me because I don’t fear them. I never have. I’ve been bitten by dogs. I 
don’t care. You know, go up to junk-yard dogs when I was 3 and my mom was like, “AH!” [Laughing] and you 
know, I just never was afraid of them. Family members on the other hand [laughing], yes. Family members can 
be pretty intimidating because if they see you doing something that isn’t the way mom would do it—I had one 
client that was extremely particular about the way that her mom and dad were cared for [41.45] and meeting 
the expectations while still doing what I needed to do was very challenging. And the interactions with the 
clients are much easier for me to handle [laughing] than the family members. 
I: 
Can you provide some examples? 
P: 
Well, one client that I had had early stages of dementia, and so it was common for her to repeat 
questions, and repeat questions Alzheimer’s, and repeat questions, and that was very difficult for the family 
members to deal with. And she had a great deal of anxiety, and so if she would get stuck on something, it 
would just get bigger and bigger, and bigger in her eyes even though it was not. And having anxiety, I complete 
get that [laughs], so I was very patient with it. I didn’t—I just answered the question again and answer the 
question again because that’s what she needed. She needed the reassurance; she needed the stability; she 
needed to have that there. I learned that because my job trained me, but it’s—you know, I had to take time out 
of my day to go to the training and do that. And although they allow you, you know, the time to go to the 
training classes, they’re quarterly. So, it’s not like you’re going every week to training class. You pick one every 
quarter to do it. So, one may be Alzheimer’s training, one may be depression training, one may be how to deal 
with difficult situations. It really depends on what’s available during that quarter, and so this woman would ask 
these questions. Well, when her husband came home, he had had a stroke, and so he could only speak 
[39.56] yes and no. And it was repetitive for him because he would try to get the intensity of what he was trying 
to describe out in yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, or no, no, no, no, no. And depending on the level of intensity, and 
she could see this person, and they looked like the person she knew, but they didn’t respond her like the 
person she knew. So, in other words, she saw the duck, the duck was, you know, looked like a duck, but it 
didn’t sound like a duck, and so there was a great deal of confusion with her trying to—she would get so 
frustrated because she’d want him to speak to her like he used to, and it just was not possible for him because 
his language skills were impaired by the stroke. So, I learned to communicate with him, trial and error, asking 
yes/no questions. Is this okay if I do this? Would you like me to do that? Would you like me to do this? Here 
are your options. Would you like this or that? So, I had to adjust that, but that still didn’t help with her anxiety 
because she would get so frustrated to the point where we’d be calling her daughter. And that would be 
dealing with [sigh], relatives. The daughter was not pleased that I called her, and I didn’t know what else to do. 
You know, they’re like grabbin’ their phones and calling her. And you can’t just snatch the phone [laughing] 
away from them, so that was difficult. And I loved them. I just loved being with them, but that was—they did not 
feel that I was providing that care that they needed, and basically was not letting them call her. That would be 
my guess, so that was complicated. 
I: 
Hmm. Families are complicated. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Marilyn Martell-Stotler. Grand Rapids.  4.25.18
11
P: 
Very complicated—all across the board [laughing].  
I: 
This is working? 
I2: 
Yes. This is working perfectly. 
I: 
Okay. Good. So, I think this is the last group of questions, right? 
I2: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Unless we wanna do four? 
I2: 
No. This is the last group. Do you think we can keep this round to like a shorter period? 
I: 
We can if we do two more segments. Is that okay? 
I2: 
Okay. Let me change batteries then. Yeah. 
I: 
What time did we start? 
P: 
Eleven ‘cause the clock went off. 
I: 
Oh, right. That’s right. It’s gonna go off in a few minutes at 12. It’s going to ding 12 times. 
P: 
No, it’ll do a little song.  
I: 
Okay. 
P: 
It plays Flash Dance. It plays I Will Always Love You. It plays Somewhere Out There. There’s one other 
one. It plays like four different tunes, and as you go through the day it’ll do that. We moved up here from 
Tennessee. We lived here for a year, and two hens in the hen house [laughing], yeah. 
I: 
Oh, you lived in this house with your mom you mean? 
P: 
Oh, yeah. [Laughing] yeah. We get along fine as long as we don’t live together, and it wasn’t that we 
didn’t get along. It was just that it was intense quite often because we had different ways of doing things, and 
you know, I’ve been on my own since I was 17, so it was very different coming back. And my dad was great 
[laughs] [36.16]. My mom and I—daughters and mothers are always complicated, though. 
I: 
That is complicated. 
I2: 
I’m about ready to start. 
I: 
So, you’re switching out batteries, so what’s better for you, two shorter segments or one? 
I2: 
No. I’m setting it up, so we can do one big, really delicious [laughs]. 
I: 
Okay. So, we’ll do another one that’s 20/25 minutes, and then we’ll finish, and K can do the photo 
shoot. Okay? So, this next section, there’s two main things I want to get into a little bit more, and that would be 
the job conditions, like the wages, the training, the injuries, that kind of thing. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And then conclude with, you know, recommendations for policymakers. What do you want to tell them? 
P: 
You must be trained. You have to have some kind of training because I don’t think that I would have 
been able to refuse that one particular lady—if I had the training, if I would have known what I was doing when 
I walked in there— 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Marilyn Martell-Stotler. Grand Rapids.  4.25.18
12
I: 
Yeah. If they’d given you more time to learn it. 
P: 
Oh, yeah. Yeah. 
I: 
Than 1 day. 
P: 
Yeah. Most of them are pretty much simply you walk in there, you do the cleaning. Whoopi-do. And 
have conversation, and you’re good. I had one lady that was [34.53] very much like that. She had two little 
dogs—pooch and Iggly—[laughing]. Iggly would—this is gonna sound really bizarre, but my mom and dad’s 
dog does it to me too, where the dogs will talk to you, but they talk in pictures. They don’t speak in words, 
obviously, but they speak in pictures, and P will tell you everything that he wants. 
I2: 
Right. 
P: 
But Iggly was the same way. Okay. 
I: 
Okay. I would like to shift gears just a little bit and talk a little bit about the labor conditions of your job. 
You’ve mentioned several things that I want to circle back and ask about including the wages. You were 
describing one case that was pretty high-level care, and you were getting paid the same amount as if you were 
just doing some cleaning or grocery shopping for the person, right? 
P: 
Right. 
I: 
And so, can you talk about the wages, and how you feel about them, and if you’re able to make a living 
doing this kind of work? 
P: 
Make a living, like I said I would do it for free, however, free does not pay bills. And I made just over 
$7,000 last year, and that’s working probably 27-28 hours a week, which is pretty much—I work 3-hour shift in 
the morning, 2-hour shift in the evening, maybe I work a 4-hour shift during the day, and then I’ll work a 2-hour 
shift at night. So, my days are broken up. As far as that’s kind of a—it’s exhausting to the point where 
sometimes I don’t—I asked for a raise. After I’d been there for 3 months, I asked for a raise because I just 
didn’t feel that I was—I wasn’t being compensated. Some of the times I have to leave—like I end up down in 
Lowell area, which is quite a little drive, and sometimes I’d be even as far as Wayland area, and I would ask—
I’d have to ask for gas stipend because that’s a long way to go for, you know $9.50 an hour. That’s what I 
make, and I get that it’s over the $7.25 minimum wage. I get that, but it is intense and exhausting. I would go to 
one client in the morning and one in the evening, and then be back in the morning, and back in the evening, 
and sometimes I’d have a third shift that I’d pick up for another client that needed to be put to bed. And that 
would get labor-intensive, so sometimes I’d be gone, you know 2 hours at a pop, which that doesn’t hardly 
seem anything, but in that 2 hours I’m making sure that they had their meals cooked, that they have their floors 
done, that they have their dishes done, that they have their trash taken out, that they have their dogs walked. 
I’m making sure that all of these things get done. Now, after I get done with my clients, I go back to my home, 
and I have to make sure that my floors are done, my dusting is done, my dishes are done, my laundry is done. 
Although, my husband does my laundry [31.33], so I feel [laughing] relief from that, but I’m doing the same 
thing all day long. It’s just as repetitive, and that is a lot of work. That is a lot of pressure to make sure that they 
are just as satisfied with their homes—sometimes my house gets neglected because I spent so much time 
doing it all day that I just can’t— 
I: 
And you’re not caring for their home, you’re caring— 
P: 
For them. 
I: 
--for them, physically doing things. 
Personal Home Health Care Aides in Michigan, afc2017/018 
Marilyn Martell-Stotler. Grand Rapids.  4.25.18

P: 
Physically, emotionally. Their physical home, their emotional home. You know, opening up their 
windows for them, so that they can get some fresh air in there. One guy was an ex-smoker, and you walk into 
the house and you’d just be like, uhh [laughs]. The heavy smell of stale smoke, and he just wouldn’t open his 
windows. He wanted his air conditioner on or his heater on, and it just—when I would leave there my clothes 
would reek of it, and I’m an ex-smoker. I quit 4 years ago, and that was extremely difficult [laughing] to go, not 
because I was tempted, but just because I think as an ex-smoker I’m more sensitive to it. I can smell cars 
going down the highway that are smoking, and it’s like uh. So, dealing with people that smoke in their homes or 
I had one client that used medicinal marijuana, and that was quite challenging because how do you—my job 
requires, you know, that you be clean. You can’t be out, you know, toking it up, and here’s this person that’s 
smoking, you know, enjoying their medical marijuana and getting, you know, their pain relief, and I have to stay 
in the other room to make sure I do the dishes. Well, the dishes are done, the floors have been done, and so 
I’m just kinda hanging out [laughing] waiting for them to get done, and then when I go back into the room, you 
know, there’s a cloud there, and you know, that panics me sometimes. That’s a little awkward ‘cause I don’t 
know— 
I: 
So, $9.50 an hour, 28 hours a week, $7,000 a year, how do you make ends meet? 
P: 
I’m very lucky to have a husband that works. If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t be able to survive on what I 
make. And if it was just me, I wouldn’t be able to [laughing] survive on what I make ‘cause I can’t [29.15]—I 
make just around or around $800 a month, which is below federal poverty level, and they consider if I’m—if my 
numbers are correct, and if I remember correctly, it’s around $12,000 where they consider that, and $7,000 is 
not anywhere close to that. And if I were even making more money or having more hours—I can’t work the 
more hours and do—I’m tired all the time. 
I: 
Well, and the working more hours I was wondering how you would be able to do that given that your 
days are so broken up. It’s 2 hours here, 2 hours there. I mean how do you plan a life around such a broken-up 
schedule like that? 
P: 
Well, when I could drive, my husband—I would take him to work in the morning, and so I would make 9 
o’clock be my earliest appointment that I could make, and sometimes I’d have to high-tail it out to—back by my 
house. Sometimes I’d have to go out to Wyoming. Sometimes I’d have to go, you know, Kentwood. Wherever 
they’d send me, and so I would consistently have these travel times in between that, but I don’t get paid for 
that. I would only get paid for when I arrive at the client’s home and check in, and so that’s gas that I have to 
cover, and that’s the insurance that—now, I take care of the maintenance of the car. So, I have to do the oil 
changes. My husband takes care of the car payments, so that part I’m good on, but I do all the maintenance 
part. Like making sure that the tires get done or that the oil changes are maintained, and so that comes out of 
my pocket [27.42]. So, when I was driving to these places, sometimes it’d just be like, oh. You know, but they 
don’t have compensation for that. You don’t get to charge the mileage because you’re not with a client, but I 
would get mileage if I took a client, you know someplace. If I went to do errands or something like that, I’d get 
paid for it, but it’s pittance. It doesn’t cover the oil change. It doesn’t cover, you know, the gas to get where I 
have to [in order] to do the things that I need to do. 
I: 
So, you do a lot to keep your clients safe. 
P: 
Yes. 
I: 
It sounds like there’s a risk of injury to yourself, and you had mentioned something about a shoulder 
injury. 
P: 
Yes. Well, I did that in December. I was adamantly defending one person on [handling] the Hoyer, and I 
just was like nope. It has to be one person. We had this conflict, and they said, “Nope. We need to have two 
people there.” And I was so frustrated, and not 2 days after that conversation I was lifting my client from her

chair to move her into the bed and my hand slipped off the Hoyer and I panicked and grabbed it back. And I 
ended up lifting her with two fingers, and then I got even more panicked because like, oh, God. And you know, 
I felt the pull, and I reacted, and I caught it with three fingers, and I ended up lifting my client on this Hoyer, and 
it tore my shoulder, my rotator cuff, and my tendon in the front, and the bicep muscle, so what—they’re gonna 
have to go in and do surgery to repair the damage that I did with this. Now, I don’t regret, you know, [laughing] 
doing what I did, but it’s costing me physically; it’s costing me emotionally. It cost far more than I get paid. You 
know, the monetary compensation is not worth what I’m putting into it physically, and that part kinda stinks. 
I: 
So, that has to affect your ability to do the job. 
P: 
Yeah. 
I: 
Tell us about that. 
P: 
Right now, I am not allowed to lift more than 10 pounds, which means that I can’t use the Hoyer life, 
that means that I can’t roll the client [25.29], that means that I can clean the cat box, but I’m right-handed, so 
getting under her counter to do, you know, I’d have to pull it out and do it with my left hand. So, luckily the 
caregivers that I work with, that are the second person there, they can pick up where I can’t. So, mostly right 
now I’m there for entertainment, and I’ve been limited to one client right now. So, I’m working maybe—let’s see 
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, like eight hours a week right now. And that’s way different than my 27, 
which doesn’t seem like a lot, but it really is because it’s so broken up. 
I: 
And you must be thinkin’ about what happens if this injury lasts a long time or gets worse or, you know, 
or the ability for you to keep doing this as your line of work? 
P: 
Truthfully, I’ve not even thought of [laughing] that because I just—I guess I’m putting a lot of hope and a 
lot of faith in the fact that once it gets fixed, after it gets healed, I’m back to being me again. And that’s one of 
the reasons why we decided on surgery because I’d already done the physical therapy route, and I’ve already 
done the—I’ve done that twice actually—and then I’ve already done the steps for trying to get everything as 
non-invasive as possible to get it done, but if I don’t—If I’m out of my sling for a long time, for example, like I 
am today—I didn’t wear it because it’s not very attractive, and I wanted to say [inaudible] louder [laughing]. So, 
I didn’t—I had to limit that, so when I go home I will be pretty much laid on my couch with my shoulder up with 
ice on it to get the swelling back down again, and so it does cost physically. But again, you know, I go, and I 
hang out with my favorite client, so that’s kind of worth it right now [laughing], to be able to see her and to talk 
with her. So. 
I: 
So, I’m going to shift gears one more time. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And just talk a little bit about the social value that we place on the work that you do—the personal care 
assistants and the work that you do—and you know, as you’re aware, we don’t put a very high value on it. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
People don’t understand what it is you do. 
P: 
No. 
I: 
Or the impact of it, the value of it to the person you’re helping. Can you talk—how do you feel about 
that? What’s your reaction to people who say you’re just a personal care worker or—I mean talk about that. 
P: 
Now, to put this in perspective, my mom was—I was born in 1968, and when my mom left my dad, 
when I was 4, left my father, when I was 4, she couldn’t get credit. She couldn’t do a lot of things by herself

because [22.26] the women’s movement and the women’s rights were shaky at best. And it wasn’t until the mid 
to late 70s before things started becoming more progressive. Now, in the 1950s, if you were a housewife, you 
were expected to have children, raise your children, you know, go to church on Sundays. The ideal Americana, 
and I think that women weren’t allowed to—the husband did all the speaking for the household. The wife was 
just this silent little person. There was [laughs] actually a training for wives that said, you know, when your 
husband—make sure the children are all dressed and cleaned up, and make sure that the dinner is on the 
table, and make sure that he has his favorite beverage by his chair, you know, and his favorite slippers. It was 
all focused towards the man; all about it. Now, that’s just my impression of it, but I feel very much like the 
caregivers that are now are treated the same way. Where we don’t have a voice. Where we can’t say, you 
know, what we want, and that the man in this situation is not hearing us. They’re not understanding that what 
we do is valuable, and that what we do as caregivers is we don’t just take care of the, we allow them to stay in 
their homes until it is medically necessary for them to be put someplace else. And that allows them to have 
independence. That allows them to have freedom. That keeps them from going into the hospital at a twinge 
because the lady with Alzheimer’s would call 911 if something was a skew, and so it prevents all of that. It’s 
more important for what I do to keep people in their homes than for somebody that is putting them into a home, 
and I feel very passionate that if we had the voice, if had that person standing up and saying, “Hey, this is not 
okay. We’ve have got to understand what this is.” Eventually, now you have women that doing careers like, 
you know what you’re doing with the research and everything. It’s just it’s phenomenal—the wait. We have a 
long way to go, but just, you know, being able to get a credit card in your own name without having to have 
your dad’s permission [laughing], you, know, that’s ridiculous that that even took place, but it did. And so, I 
really do feel that if we had a voice that was solid and in the faces of people that can make a grander blanket. 
“Say, hey, this is what we have to—we have to lift this up. We need to train these people. We need to make 
them to where people see them,” and I’m not an invisible that just kinda comes in and does what it is—just a 
caregiver. That’s insulting [laughing], that’s really insulting. I’m not just anything. I am somebody who loves 
what I do, and that it’s important to me to make sure that it’s done correctly [19.21]. 
I: 
It’s important to you, and the value to the client—what it allows them to do. 
P: 
Yeah. They get to stay home. 
I: 
And the value to society? 
P: 
The value to society? We’re like the under-pulse. You know, my parents are in their 70s, and I come 
over—my dad had knee-replacement surgery. I’d come over, and I was sweeping the floors for ‘em. You know, 
that was what my dad primarily did, and so, yes, we take care of our families, but what if they don’t have any 
family. Like the guys that I was telling you about. He doesn’t have family left anymore that can come and help 
him. They don’t have that. It’s not just about family members doing this. This is about people that don’t have 
family, that don’t have somebody else. My favorite client is younger than me. I’m 50, and she’s younger than 
me, and her patients are well into their 70s, and what happens to her when they’re gone? And I think that I’m 
allowing her by what I do just to be as independent as possible, and she still has hope she can get married. 
She still has hope that she can have children, and that’s a relief to her parents because they don’t—they don’t 
have to have that responsibility when they’re, you know, well past retirement age. And that—it’s crucial what I 
do, and I don’t think that keeping us silent is going to benefit anybody. 
I: 
So, you’ve already, I think, said a lot of important things right then and there, but pretend for a minute 
that I’m the president of the United States, or I’m the governor of Michigan, and I need to understand more 
about how do we fix this? You know, you need higher wages to make a living wage, right? 
P: 
Yup. 
I: 
You need for everybody to put higher value—

Marilyn Martell-Stotler. Grand Rapids.  4.25.18

P: 
Yes. 
I: 
--on what you do. You’ve mentioned training a number of times. 
P: 
Training, yes. 
I: 
So, tell me—give me some recommendations. How do we fix this?  
P: 
How do we fix this.  
I: 
Yeah. What would your recommendations be? 
P: 
Well, definitely I would say that if you are going to be employing somebody like me that they have to 
be—I found out that my employer makes way! more than I do. They make well over—almost three times what I 
make for that, and I realize they’ve got, you know, brick and mortar to cover, but I do too. And the wages must 
be higher than $7,000 a year—can’t live on that. You know, I would be homeless if I had to live on $7,000 a 
year. That’s ridiculous. That is well below poverty level, so please, please make us as valued monetarily as we 
should be socially, and socially, you know, when you say you’re a caregiver you get that look. A little bit of a 
sneer, and I would say don’t sneer at me because you’re gonna be old one day too, and you’re going to have 
these issues that, you know, maybe you won’t be able to sweep your floors. Maybe you won’t be able to scrub 
your toilet. Maybe you won’t be able to [16.20] get up out of your bed without assistance. That’s where my 
value comes to the forefront, and that’s why you need to value what we do. You need to see how important we 
are, and as far as the training—training, training, training, training. You never know what you’re gonna run into, 
and it could be medical, it could be non-medical, but whatever it is, you have to have the skill level enough to 
know when do you call 911? When do you say, hey, I need to talk to your case manager? When do you say 
this is beyond that? You have to have some kind of a baseline in order to find out where, you know, how can 
we improve this? How can we make this better, by training. Teach them, you know, where that baseline is. This 
is the basic knowledge we have to do. Have CPR certification classes. Have, you know, first aid classes so you 
know what to do when these situations arise. How do you use one of those defibrillator things [laughs]? I can 
never say that word right. You know, how do you use one of those? How do you make sure that your client is 
going to get the maximum bang for their buck, and still be able to stay in their home? And that’s—it’s so 
important. I mean you wouldn’t wanna just be moved out of your house into someplace else. Don’t let them do 
that either, and the only way you can do that is by training the workforce and making sure that there’s a 
baseline for them to grow from. 
I: 
It is estimated that in Michigan along we’re going to need 32,000 more personal care workers by 2020, 
which is a year and a half away. 
P: 
[Laughing] that’s ridiculously high. 
I: 
Isn’t that crazy.  
P: 
That is. 
I: 
So, how do you—what would you say to potential people? How do we get more personal care workers? 
P: 
How do you get more personal care workers [14.33]. 
I: 
Yeah. What would you say to encourage people to be in this field, even though [laughs] you can’t make 
a living wage. 
P: 
[Laughing]. 
I: 
And you get no respect, you know.

P: 
What would make it worth it to you? 
I: 
Yeah. Right. 
P: 
[Pause] I don’t—like I said a couple times, you can—I would do it without pay even though I can’t make 
a living without, it is—I get such a deep satisfaction knowing that what I’m doing for these people is offering 
them a light that they would not be able to have without me, that I’m giving them an opportunity to maintain 
their worth and their personal values of themselves just by being their body when their bodies give out on 
them. So, I would say it’s worth every—every minute that I get to spend with them is worth it, on such a deep 
level and such an emotional level, that I feel very satisfied with that. Now, if I could just get paid for that value 
[laughing], I’d be even happier, but it is tremendously satisfying for me to be able to see my clients happy in 
their homes and [13.24] comfortable in their lives. 
I: 
So, M, you are a complete inspiration, and I want to thank you for the work that you do. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I: 
Would you—any final thoughts that you want to share with us or with the governor or the people, you 
know, the public, any final thoughts or stories that you want to share before we close? 
P: 
I’m going to have the most interesting stories to tell at the old folk’s home [laughing], and I don’t want to 
go to an old folk’s home until I am medically not able to stay at my house. So, I would use me [laughing]. 
Essentially, I would use me. 
I: 
I would use you too. I would hope to have you. Thank you for this interview and thank you for the work 
that you do. 
P: 
You’re welcome. Glad to do it. 
I2: 
Thanks so much. 
P: 
Thank you. 
I2: 
Wow. That was so great. You asked all—like I didn’t have any input. That was so great. 
I: 
Yeah. I was waiting for you to jump in. 
I2: 
Yeah. You asked the last two questions—was exactly an answer I wanted to hear. I mean thanks for 
the answer. 
I: 
Yeah. You were perfect. 
P: 
Well, thank you. 
I: 
Beautiful. Yeah, and I wanna us to stay in communication because I think there will be—you said it 
several times, that you haven’t had a voice. You need a voice, and you would be a great voice to rally people. 
P: 
I have a problem with being contagious [laughing]. One of the things in the church that I belong to, for 
example if people found out that I was [11.43] going to be there, they would have a higher turnout. Not 
because I’m like all that, but because my passion becomes contagious. People will get around me, and they’d 
be like, “Holy, crap. I haven’t thought of that. You know, let’s do this. Let’s go.” 
I: 
It’s a gift. 
P: 
I’m an excellent cheerleader. I’m excellent at ideas. I’m not so much at the implementation [laughing]. 
It’s just because I want people to feel passionately about what they do, and what they love, and do about this.

I: 
It comes through loud and clear, and it’s a gift. I’m gonna let K take over. 
I2: 
Yeah. I’m just gonna show you some film, and— 
I: 
He’s going to set you up for some great photographs. 
P: 
Excellent. Now, am I going to be able to see this video? Oh, fantastic. 
I: 
Yeah. At some point. K you can answer that better. 
I2: 
So, so the photos of course. The videos—take us a little bit longer to edit and put together. 
P: 
Right. 
I2: 
And so, let me talk about those two components separately. I would love to share images with you that 
are not project images. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
Essentially, I’m after one photo. I’m after one storytelling photo just of you, and that’s what we’re using 
for this project and that’s going to be like the still version of everything. And if you would like I can share some 
of that—other ones. 
P: 
Okay. 
I: 
And I think after their published—after the story ones are published— 
I2: 
Of course, yes. 
I: 
Then they will be available too. 
I2: 
So, yeah. After the story is published, and we choose the final video selections, and the image 
selections, then, yes, of course. We just want to keep some of the imagery a little bit protected because we 
want this project to release some of these photos. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
Along with being almost like visual public-service announcements or like— 
P: 
[Laughs] that’s what I talked about. 
I2: 
This is also like a campaign. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
And the campaign comes along with an art side to this project, and that’s what our big pitch is. 
P: 
Okay. 
I2: 
I’ve done this before two times. One time for the Detroit bicycling community because a lot of people 
were getting hit and killed. 
P: 
Oh, jeez.  
I2: 
And then another time for refugees who’ve moved to Lansing. And both times like these— 
P: 
[Laughing] that’s exciting.

I2: 
--and these videos became—were gallery shows, and we didn’t release them ‘til after the show 
because the show was the release. 
P: 
Got ya. 
I2: 
So, that’s why—we respect you and really appreciate your time, but that might be a little bit of the 
reason we’re going to keep these a little bit hidden until that happens. 
P: 
Oh, I don’t—that’s like—I just mean like eventually am I going to. 
I2: 
Oh, of course. 
P: 
I’m not meaning like, dude, hand it over now [laughing]. No, not at all. 
I2: 
And that’s like our goal, and in parallel to doing these interviews, that’s what we’re working on, that 
component of things. 
I: 
Yeah. And there will be a lot of programming eventually when we have an exhibit. It’s sort of—you 
know, our messaging hasn’t been so great over the last 20, 30 years. People aren’t listening. Policymakers 
aren’t listening.  
P: 
I’ll go places and talk to people [laughs]. I love to travel. 
I: 
We have to communicate in different ways, and this is—a new way of doing it is through art and 
photography and your stories. So, we would love to have a traveling exhibit for example. 
P: 
That’s the cat that I was telling you about [7.49]
