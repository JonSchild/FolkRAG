ORAL DATA OBTAINED 8/18/78 re D. M. AKERS FARMSTEAD 
House built in 1876 by Mrs. D.B. Akers great-great grandfather. 
He was a blacksmith, wheel\£kght, and farrier. Als^fnade tools 
and repaired tools for neighbors. 
He operated a blacksmith shop on the farmsite and shop was located 
lust above the new house, facing the public road. Wien the county 
relocated the road the shop was moved cl°se^°^e ^ sSop had 
and has been converted into a garage and woodshed. The shop ha 
a fixed or stationary forge,with leather bellows. 
w _ Akers mother, nee Quesinberry, usedto weave chair bottoms 
ou; of binders t«ine. She also recalled shearing sheep, ^eing »ool 
and knitting. (She did not mention spinning but there is a large 
spinning wheel, or remnants thereof, in the attic.) Sxu She als 
guilts. 
The old house is being used as family storage. Several fine '‘an¬ 
tique" pieces, such as wheelwrightts traveler, pie safe, bureau, 
etc., are yet to be apportinned among family members when the 
estate from Mrs. Aker*s father is stetttled. 
Relative to work & day labor, Mrs. Akers* mother said,"I did 
every kind of man’s work except mow hay." 
Concerning family discipline, she said, ,,W® wor^ed hf^ TlZT 
we were afraid of ny father... He never whipped me but a look 
from him was enough." 
She also stated that her father operated a stationary hay baJ-ing 
machine? a horse with blinders for turning the sweep which 
powered*the toiler. Also, the toiler served the leal community. 
The present farm has 3U acres. Previously consisted of UO acres 
but sold off six to a neighbor because it was difficult to re 
for farming purposes. 
(NOTE: There are numerous split bottom chairs stored in 
old house and Mrs. Aker’s mother said her c^s were 
made by a "man from across the mountain". Incidentally, 
her chairs and those found at bhe Tasker Martin farm 
appeared to hatee been made by same person.)

Mrs. Akers and mother were shelling a very colorful red-mottled 
bean. When asked what kind, she replied, "I don’t know. The 
Watkins product man brought us the seed'I 
Mrs. Akers also said: "W always have raided our own hogs for 
meat. We feed them mil^ sour milk, and milk byproducts. 
We are currently milking 2 Guernsey cows and 1 Brown Swiss/Jersey 
cross. We separate the cream & milk by skimming off the cream 
by hand. We use to use a separator when we sold cream to the 
daily but new we don’t selltothe dairy. We sometimes sell some 
milk to our neighbors. The fEwr Guernsey’s give a large volume 
of milk but the BrownSwiss/Jersey gives the richer cream." 
Mr. Akers and lU yr old son are farmers. The son wants tb 
continue as a farmer. (They were busy processing hay for a 
brother of Mr. Akd^s to feed his beef cattle.). 
The family shops in Hillville supermarkets rather than in 
the local country stores. They go the Ice al Baptist church 
some twomiles away. 
When the old house site became unsuitable for living purposes 
the new house was built directly opposite, but across the 
little stream^in order to be closer to the public road. New 
the entire family wish they had used the old site because the 
road is "too close" to the new house for comfort. 
Mrs. Akers mother is knowledgeable abcut the famous Hillsville 
murder/shootings, but was only a child at the time of occurence. 
"A neig^hbor lady was at the trial, came by to tell mother about 
it, and-then fainted as she told it." 
Mrs. Akers father served in U.S. Army during World W^r I, in 
France, and Germany. His uniform blouse is still hanging in 
the old house but "he put on the pants and wore them out as 
work pants." Blouse still has infantry button insigns and 
campaign bars on it. 
The same gentleman was alsoa barber, cutting local fellows 
hair. His daughter was cutting her mother’s hair, using an 
old time barber chair but electric clippers. Her father, when 
he became too ill to farm^iittled wooden spoons - "I bet that 
every lady in the community has one of his spoons!" He also 
made axe & hammer handles out of hickory, smoothing their 
sides by scraping with a piece of glass.
