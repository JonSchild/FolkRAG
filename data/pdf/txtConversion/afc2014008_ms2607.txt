sKetch is the moving of the cnhldren's pl.
.y room.
 The
 
reason I moved it was because its only light in your
 
sketch was received from across the enclosed porch, and
 
I felt that the lig t would not be good for study.  Vhat
 
I have considered minor changes, is the arrangement of
 
the bathrooms so that they are entered through only one
 
door fr iu a hail instead of being entered directly frea
 
Lhe bedrooms and canse.
.uently rejuiririg two doors, for
 
most people, the single door is desirable; and I have
 
made the closets shell';

I think explanations are necessary.
 This being a first

are simply not .

hat you want.
 I believe, however,  that
 
you  ill be abis to indicate any undesirable features
 
oy using a colored pencil to write explanatory  critici 1s
 
directly on the blue print.
 I am enclosing two prints
 
so you can mark one up and send it bacic  s me  n
