When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught lo me were quite a 
ell arm 
She 
wild often take me on her knee when tired of childish 
lay, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother 
CHORUS. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch-word be despatch and practice what you preach, 
Do not let your chances like sunbeams pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when ofthnes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me, and thus has me advised; 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, bestrewn with care and strife, 
I 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering in my ear. 
Waste not, want not, drc. 
Then I 
studied strict economy and found to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasped each chance and always struck the iron while twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities and never once forgot: 
Waste not, want not, d:c. 
I'm inTrried now and happy, I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony devoid of care and strife, 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have Rifle children three, 
The lessen that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee; 
Waste not, want not, 'lc.

YOU'VE been to Central Park of course, 
And know the place so well 
I 
need not now describe it, 
But there's one thing I 
can tell: 
It's just the place to go 
To catch a 
darling beau, 
And have a 
sweet flirtation— 
Just for fun, you know, 
Just for fun, ha, ha, ha! 
Just for fun, ha, ha! 
CHORUS . 
Flirting on the Mall, 
Flirting on the Mall ; 
To a 
nice young miss I 
throw a 
kiss, 
Flirting on the Mall ; 
She returns a 
smile— 
I 
advance the while, 
And I 
take her arm without alarm— 
Flirting on the Mall. 
Some go to Long Branch for a 
lark, 
And some to Rockaway; 
But here beside the Central Park 
I 
would prefer to stay ; 
Because I 
think it nice, 
And roguish eyes entice 
Young men like me to fall in 
Thy are so nice, 
Oh, so nice ! ha, ha, ha! 
Oh, so nice ! ha, ha! 
Flirting on the Mall, etc. 
I'm always there on music days, 
And keep my eyes alive, 
To feed upon the passing smiles 
That, grace the walk and drive 
No place there is like this, 
So full of walking bliss ; 
And sometimes when I 
have the chance 
I 
steal a 
kiss— 
Steal a 
kiss, hiss, kiss, kiss (imitate kissing), 
Steal a 
kiss! ha, ha I

THE TIPPERARY MEN. 
OR, THE ROLLICKING IRISHMAN. 
Sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
So, boys, I'm here once more you see, and a 
story I'm going to 
tell ; 
It's something new between, me and you, which an Irishman 
befell ; 
'Twas in the town of Liverpool, in a 
street I 
forget the name, 
But to pass the time in the chorus join, just while I 
sing the 
same. 
CHORUS. 
His name was Pat—just think of that! and beat it if you can; 
There's none so gay, both night and day, as a 
rollicking Irish-
man; 
Whack, whack, whack, hurroo, tiddy I 
dow de dow, 
Whack, whack, whack, hurroo, tiddy I 
dow de dow; 
Oh, at a 
wake or a 
fair we're always there, the Tipperary men. 
Now the weather was cold, and this hero bold about for work 
did seek; 
He got a 
job to carry bricks at eighteen shillings a 
week; 
He bou ,dit, a 
hod for half a 
crown from a 
man named Mickey 
Burke, 
And Pat so gay the very next day at six o'clock went to work. 
His name was Pat, etc. 
They were building a 
house—'twas very high, but Pat didn't 
care a 
jot ; 
To his work got drilled, when his hod was filled, how quick up 
the ladder he'd trot; 
He was going to the top about twelve o'clock, but whether ' twas 
frost or the rum, 
This hero bold he missed his hold, and down he came by the 
run. 
His name was Pat, etc. 
Now, as Pat down did go, be put his hand so, and then a 
loud 
yell he gave; 
He cried, " Och hone!" as down he came; " may the Lord my 
poor soul save !" 
He turned o'er and o'er when he reached the first floor, on his 
feet he then tried to jump, 
But his head first came down, and when near the ground he 
cried,'" Now for a 
thundering bump !" 
His name was Pat, etc.

YE may talk about your " Mulligan Guards," and " Regular 
Army, Oh!" 
I 
never shall forget the day I 
started for to go 
And be a 
bold milishee boy, so happy, gay and free, 
In the gallant " Sixty-Ninth," I 
jined the ranks of Company 
They put me in the " Awkward Squad," wid about a 
dozen 
more, 
Wid a 
musket on me shoulder, sure they made me walk the 
floor ! 
We march'd unto the right and left, until me feet were sore, 
When we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
CHORUS. 
" 
Lift! 
Lift !" the sargint used to say, 
" 
Now ye's have it! can't ye keep it'? 
Turn yer head this way! 
Right about! 
Shoulder arms VI 
An hour every day, 
Whin we were in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
I 
found it very diffikilt to kape the step at all 
Along wid all the others whin paradin in the Hall 
At aich mistake I 
used to make, the sargint be would say : 
" 
Yer as awkward as the divil; doan't ye hould yer goon that 
way !"

THE TIMID AWKWARD SQUAD.—Continued. 
Whine'er he'd spake an ordher but egad! ' twas wid a 
vim ; 
I 
often wish'd, upon my soul, to put a 
head on him. 
But he at least weigh'd twenty stone, while I 
was very slim, 
From marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift ! 
Lift!" etc. 
7 
Whin we're considered compitant, into the company 
They'll put us in the ranks at wanst, and there they'll let us be; 
And undher sargint's orders thin no longer we will plod, 
Shot ldher arms, and counter marchin' in the timid " Awkward 
Squad." 
Whin out into the strate we go to have a 
foine parade, 
We'll be looked upon wid pride, me boys, by every servant 
maid ; 
And wid the sargint on our right no more we'll be afraid, 
Of marching in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift! 
Lift!" etc. 
If ever I'm promoted, and a 
Gineral I 
be, 
I'll make 'em feel me vingeance, all the sargints under me! 
I'll have ' ern rnarchin' leery day, or carryin' the hod, 
For being so uncivil to the timid " Awkward Squad." 
And if they should retallyate or give me any talk, 
I'll rejuce thim to the ranks at wanst, and there I'll make ' ern 
walk ! 
If that ain't punishment enough " like any other gawk," 
Gad, I'll put them in the timid " Awkward Squad." 
" 
Lift ! 
Lift!" etc.

I'LL come when the little stars are shining, 
Where the twilight soft and still ; 
Into night deeper shadows is declining 
All around the plain and bill. 
I'll seek thee among the willows, 
Where I 
first felt love's young dream, 
And renew our delight, while the moon shines bright, 
Down by the old mill stream. 
CHORUS. 
Down by the old mill stream, 
There in the moon's gentle gleam ; 
To-night I'll wait for thee, 
And happy we will be— 
Down by the old mill stream. 
I'll come when the pretty flow'rs are sleeping 
When the song-birds are at rest; 
And I'll bring all the kisses I've been keeping 
For the darling I 
love best. 
I 
long for thy voice to cheer me, 
And the hours so sweet will seem, 
When we sit side by side, while the rippling tide, 
Plays by the old mill stream. 
Down by the, etc. 
— 
We'll hear but the echo of our voices, 
And the streamlets bubbling flow, 
As it rolls on before us and rejoices, 
Seeming glad in the pale moon's glow. 
While night is advancing 
We will linger and our vows of old redeem, 
And the anoels above will smile on our love, 
Down by the old mill stream.

Composed by 3IARCEL DE DONATO. 
You see I 
belong to New York, my boys, 
On dear old Manhattan Isle, 
Famed for its wealth and its beauty, boys, 
Its darling dear girls and their style; 
On Broadway, my boys, or the Bowery 
No stranger e'er met with a 
frown; 
Take my word, I 
belong to the city, 
And hail from the East Side of town. 
CHORUS . 
The East Side of town 
Beats the world up and down 
For pic-nic, party, or ball, 
For boys without fear, 
And good lager beer, 
The East Side of town beats them all. 
,The dandies they dance on the Avenue V, 
In aristocratic soirees, 
Champagne they drink as if it were tea, 
Their pa's and their mamma's to please; 
,They should see the quadrille called the Nine Pin, 
Or a 
real old-fashioned break-down; 
They pivot, you bet, on a 
spangle, 
The girls from the East Side of town. 
The East Side, etc. 
The mechanic you will find there too, 
The industrious laboring class, 
The sewing girl from her labor and toil 
On the sidewalk cloth cheerfully pass; 
She is happy indeed, and little doth need, 
If she has but a 
calico gown; 
We all do agree that if jolly you'd be, 
You must live on the East Side of town.

kiHE WOULD, 
YOU KNOW ; SHE WAS JUST 
ABOUT THE AGE . 
OH! once I 
dearly loved a 
girl, her name was Sarah Greene, 
No rarer girl, no fairer girl, than Sarah shall be seen. 
Seventeen years old, need you be told, for a 
sweetheart she'd a 
rage, 
But then, of course, she would you know, she's just about the 
age. 
CHORUS. 
But then, of course, she would, you know, 
She would, you know she would, 
But then, of course, she would, you know, 
She's just about the age. 
She lived a 
little way from town, it wasn't very far, 
And with her lived a 
cross old chap, altho' he was her pa. 
One clay when her papa was out, I 
went to her's to dine, 
And in my pocket, for a 
treat, I 
took a 
glass of wine. 
For she liked wine, she would, you know, etc. 
We sat and talked a 
little while, and after we had dined, 
I 
for a 
little drop of wine felt mightily inclined ; 
When her father he knocked at the door, and she to me did 
rush, 
And pushed me in the cupboard, and oh! I 
saw her blush! 
But then, of course, she would, etc. 
Her father sat and talked to her for half an hour or more, 
And she sat leaning all the while against the cupboard door, 
When the wine flask in my pocket broke and made a 
precious 
mess, 
Ran under the cupboard door and round her new silk dress, 
For she wore silk, she would, etc. 
Her father saw the flowing wine, and said, " Sarah, what is 
that ?" 
She said, " Some jam and pickle jars are broken by the cat." 
He opened then the cupboard door, saying much like damn, 
And I 
was in a 
pickle, as well as in a 
jam. 
And the old man swore, he would, etc. 
He pulled me out and punched my head, then with f. ood humor 
he 
On hearing I 
was not bad off, invited me to tea. 
Since then I've married Sarah Green, and yearly to my joy, 
My Sarah will present me with a 
little girl or boy. 
But then, of course, she would, etc.

IT HASN'T HAPPENED YET. 
W REN I 
was born, some years ago, ' twas prophesied of me, 
That, if I 
lived to be a 
man, a 
wonder I 
should be; 
But now I've come to man's estate, I 
must say with regret, 
I 
may turn out a 
wonder, but it hasn't happened yet. 
I 
may turn, etc. 
When I was sent to Grammar School where I was taught to 
fight, 
I 
spent my time in writing rhyme, if not in rhyming right ; 
'Tis sorrowful to know it, but my plans are a!1 upset; 
I 
may turn out -a

I 
may turn, etc. 
Last Season, when at Leamington, I 
courted, but in vain, 
A 
fascinating damsel, by the name of Kitty Payne; 
I 
asked her if she'd marry, but she said, " My darling pet, 
Some day perhaps I'll love you; " but it hasn't happened yet. 
Some day, etc. 
As with a 
confidential friend, next morn, I 
broke my fast; 
"By Jove!" he said, " you're settled, Fred, she's done you 
brown at last; 
Here Kitty Payne has run away with little Captain Brett." 
I 
thought my heart had broken but it hasn't happened yet. 
I 
thought, etc. 
Of course, I 
saw the value of a 
sympathising friend, 
And parted when he'd asked me if a 
fiver I 
would lend. 
Says he, " I'll pay to-morrow ; for I 
hate to be in debt 
But I 
find out, to my sorrow, that it hasn't happened yet. 
But I

A much respected maiden-aunt I 
thought had lately died, 
And left me just a 
thousand pounds, a 
house and lands besides, 
All this I 
learnt by telegram; but a 
friend of hers I 
met, 
Consoled my grief by saying that it hadn't happened yet. 
Consoled, etc. 
One evening, when out for a 
stroll, I 
found a 
clumsy thief 
Without my leave was borrowing my pocket- handkerchief; 
He bellowed when I 
kicked him with a 
force he won't forget, 
He thought I 
was the victim, but it hasn't happened yet. 
He thought, etc. 
And new a 
fair good-night to all, my song is nearly done, 
And may success attend us where there's fortunes to be won; 
Let's breast the hill with such a 
will as knows not how to fret, 
And we'll win the goal with honor such as never happened yet.

THE USED-UP MAN. 
Ain.—" 
Lacy Neal." 
OH ! I 
ain't got no home, 
Nor nothing else, I 
'
spose; 
Misfortune seems to follow me 
Where'er abouts I 
goes. 
I 
shouldn't wonder if 
'Twould be my precious luck 
Forever in the mud 
Of misery to be stuck. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I'm a 
used- up man, 
Oh! I'm a 
used- up man; 
But if ever I 
gets up again, 
I'll stick up like a 
man. 
I 
'
spose that when I 
dies, 
From Satan I'll be driven, 
And made to loaf around about, 
Outside the walls of heaven. 
With no one there to take me in, 
Like a 
true friend to greet me, 
And nary one to cheer me up, 
And not a 
soul to treat me. 
Oh ! I'm, etc 
I'd get along like grease, 
If it wasn't for these ere clothes, 
This crownless hat and shabby co t, 
And also my rummy nose ; 
My boots are waterproof, 
Which makes me happy feel; 
For, the water comes in at the toes, 
And goes out at the heel. 
Oh! I'm, etc.

Why cold to-day ? once I 
was dear ! 
Then, thy heart stirr'd and flusb'd thy brow, 
Never a 
word welcomes me now. 
Now thy hand lies listless in mine, 
Once its replies spake love divine! 
Cold as if we never had met ; 
Can it then be hearts can forget ? 
Ah, speak to me, speak ! 
Be my heart heard, 
Or will it break for one poor word I 
No vow to bind, no pledge, I

Only be kind! speak, to me, speak—speak ! 
One idle day thou did'st deplore, 
Some castaway on desert shore; 
'Twas but a 
tale by poet feign'd, 
Yet thou did'st pale, silent and pained, 
And thou did'st moan ; sad, sad to be 
Utterly lone by the bleak sea! 
My life is drear, I 
cast away. 
Give me the tear thou shed'st that day!

SOFTLY O'ER THE RIPPLING WATERS. 
SOFTLY o'er the rippling waters 
Wander strains of melody, 
Whil the sun in glory dying 
Sinks below the golden sea. 
Echoes on my heart are falling, 
Dreams of other days arise, 
Happy dreams of dear ones dwelling 
Far in yonder purple skies. 
CHORUS. 
Hark, hark, the angels whisper, 
As they dwell in holy power; 
Songs of peace to those that sorrow 
In the twilight's tranquil hour. 
Softly over the rippling waters 
Early stars in beauty shine, 
Lovely ar us are twining round me, 
Lovely lips are pressing mine, 
Sad, but sweet is memory's vision, 
Sadder still to bid farewell. 
Who would sigh could we but, linger, 
Never more to break the spell.

THE LIQUOR LAW. 
As revised by JOHNNY ROACH. 
ONE Mick MacGee, from Arranafee, who once was a 
bold sailor, 
oh! 
But growing old, as I've been told, he turned a 
liquor dealer, 
ob! 
To license, Mick would not agree, or pay the excise bounty, oh ! 
But he sould away, both night and day, and beat the excise of 
the county, oh ! 
CHORUS. 
Arrah grammachree, come drink with me, 
The liquor law won't injure me ; 
Arrah gramrnachree, come drink with me, 
The liquor law won't injure me. 
Two policemen bold, as I've been told, heard Mick was selling 
on the sly, 
So off they went, with full intent to get a 
bottle they did try. 
They went in then, dressed like rag- men, and took a 
seat down 
in the shop, 
Asked Mrs. MacGee if so kind she'd be, as to give them a 
bet-, 
tie of the real ould drop. 
Arrah grammachree, etc. 
A 
thought struck her then, that she knew the men, and a 
big 
black bottle she went and got, 
She went into the room saying, " I'll be back soon," and she 
filled it nicely up with slops, 
" 
NI let you see," says Mrs. MacGee, " the liquor I 
sell is the 
real ould stock." 
As she filled it right, she corked it tight, and she got two dol-
lars for a 
bottle of slops. 
Arrah grammachree, etc. 
The police in glee ran off, do you see, and stated the case to 
Kennedy, 
Who opened his eyes at cheating the excise," Go, bring your 
prisoner at once to me ; 
You say she did sell," as he took a smell (Phew), " and what 
did you pay for the bottle you got ?" 
" 
Two dollars," said they, " we had to pay; " " Why, you fool-
ish men, it's nothing but slops." 
Arrah grammachree, etc. 
The police in dread hung down their heads, when they saw how 
nicely they were done, 
Away they went from Kennedy, with the stinking bottle they 
thought was rum ; 
And Mick MacGee and his wife Mary, kept selling away at the 
same old spot. 
And if a 
spy or a 
policeman comes round, she gives them a 
bot-
tle of the real ould stock. 
Arrah, grammachree, etc. gir

THE BROADWAY POLICEMAN. 
Composed by Caen= HOWARD, and sung by EDDIE BILLDY. 
I 
AM a 
Broadway policeman, as you may plainly see; 
I 
was appointed to the force in eighteen seventy-three; 
I 
came from dear old Ireland, the land of the old sod, 
So now behold me here so bold, as I 
march in the Broadway 
squad. 
CHORUS. 
And on Broadway I 
march so gay, all rows and fights I 
stop on 
the way; 
The boys all shout as I 
turn out, " Cheese it! there's a 
cop! 
run away." 
I 
bid good-bye to Ireland, and came across the sea, 
To land on sweet Columbia's shore, where one and all are free; 
When I 
came to this country I 
used to carry the hod, 
Till I 
fell in with an alderman, who put me on the Broadway 
squad. 
And on Broadway, etc. 
When I 
go out on duty I'm always dressed so neat; 
I 
assist the pretty girls with auburn curls across the crowded 
street; 
Then ask of them their number just merely as a 
cod; 
You'd be amazed at the girls I 
raise as I 
march in the Broad-
way squad. 
And on Broadway, etc.

DISSOLVING VIEWS. 
Composed and sung by GEORGE Evans, English Comic, and given by him 
to JOHNNY ROACH. 
Ant.—" Castles in the Air." 
W HILE thinking of sonic past events at home the other night, 
Seated at my cheerful fire, which then was burning bright, 
At last I 
he fire began to fade—a 
shadow o'er it grew ; 
I 
fancied I 
was looking at some great dissolving view; 
Some VieWS there were that gave me joy, while others gave me 
pain; 
Oh, may I 
never see them in reality again; 
So give me your attention, and I'll quickly tell to you 
Some pictures that I 
witnessed in my great dissolving view. 
The first view was of sad distress, a 
truly wretched case; 
The family of a 
workingman, hunger stared them in the face; 
The mother and their children gathered round a 
scanty fire, 
The last sparks even threatening every moment to expire; 
At last the father enters, and hangs his honest head, 
And silently he shares with them his last loaf of bread; 
Though honest, he is forced to steal, and into jail he's throw ; 
This sad and truthful picture is my second dissolving view. 
The next was a 
police court; two prisoners in were led; 
One, a 
well- dressed swindler, and the other a 
boy ill- fed; 
The boy had stolen, and confessed his guilt, and for pardon 
did entreat; 
He said, " I 
am an orphan boy, and nothing had to eat ;" 
Three months hard labor was his doom—the tears ran down 
his face; 
While he who swindled many a 
man walked out with a 
good 
grace ; 
He paid for counsel with his spoil—his money put him through, 
That ends the case, and he gets free in this dissolving view. 
The third it was a 
murder cold, a 
tragic one, I'm sure; 
It was a 
man of manly heart, and a 
good friend to the poor, 
Shot down by an assassin dastardly and cold; 
But shooting men quite unawares is the fashion now, I'm told ; 
The murder of Jim Fisk, I 
mean, a 
man known to you all ; 
In this wide world he played his part, and rolling kept the ball 
I 
hope his spirit's gone aloft, I 
most sincerely do, 
Ever more to rest in peace in this dissolving view.

CLOSE the shutters—Willie's dead, 
Whom we loved so dear— 
Like a 
dream his spirit fled 
From our home, now sad and drear; 
When the spring- time flowers were blooming, 
And the happy birds sung sweet, 
Angels called him to their home, 
Up in heaven where we shall meet. 
CHORUS. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead ; 
Hope with him has fled 
Froom our home, now sad and lone; 
Close the shutters— Willie's dead. 
Close the shutters— Willie's dead; 
Gone in childhood's bloom— 
Pillowed now his little head 
In the cold and silent tomb. 
O'er his grave the daisies blossom, 
Where his little form is laid, 
And the murm'ring streamlet plays 
'Neath the willow's quiet shade. 
Close the shutters, etc. 
Close the shutters—Willie's dead— 
Death has claimed him now; 
Never more his smile will shed 
Sunshine on poor mother's brow. 
She is almost broken-hearted, 
And our home is sad to-day; 
Life has lost its hope and joy, 
Since our Willie's gone away. 
Close the shutters, etc.

M OTHER dear, come bathe my forehead, 
For I'm growing very weak. 
Mother, let one drop of water 
Fall upon my burning cheek; 
Tell my loving little schoolmates 
That I 
never more will play— 
Give them all my toys; but, mother, 
Put my little shoes away. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am going to leave you, mother, 
So remember what I 
say; 
Oh, do it, won't you 7 
please, mother, 
Put my little shoes away. 
Santa Claus he gave them to me, 
With a 
lot of other things, 
And I 
think he brought an angel 
With a 
pair of golden wings; 
Mother, I 
will be an angel 
By perhaps another day, 
.So you will then, dearest mother, 
Put my little shoes away. 
I 
am going, etc, 
Soon the baby will be larger, 
Then they'll fit his little feet ; 
Oh, he'll look so nice and cunning, 
When he walks along the street. 
Now I'm getting tired, mother; 
Soon I'll say to all good- day! 
Please remember what I 
tell you— 
Put my little shoes away. 
I 
am going, etc.

WE TAKE 'BM IN. 
—" Gens d'..4.rnies Duet." 
Two policemen on the beat are we, 
Dressed in nice warm winter clothes. 
And we're strictly temperate, you see, 
You can tell it by our nose. 
We watch little boys upon the street, 
And when they to fight begin, 
We take ' ern in, (
Repeat twice.) 
For they are not strong, you know, 
We take ' ern in, (Repeat twice.) 
But the big rascals we let go. 
Woodhull and Claflin good folks condemn, 
For they've blood upon the brain; 
But, George Francis Train, he comforts them. 
And keeps them on good champagne. 
Now if they get out and come to us, 
And wash them of their sin, 
We'll take ern in, (Repeat twice.) 
And show them something funny; 
We'll take 'ern in, (Repeat twice.) 
And we don't want any blood- money. 
We are much obliged for your applause, 
And we're glad you like our soncT; 
But our voices are about used up because 
Or throats are not very strong. 
Some other night when you come this way, 
With your pockets full of tin. 
We'll take you in ; (Repeat Twice.) 
So you should let us off, we think. 
We must away, 
We cannot stay, 
We must obey, 
Our orders say 
That we must cm and take a 
drink. 
BEAUTIFUL LOVE. 
As sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
LOVE, lose, oh, what is love 7 
love, ' tis that makes man feel so 
peculiar: 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a, Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia 7 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack it's like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, love it is that makes a 
man feel so pecu 
liar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a 
man's but a 
fool when he falls in love. 
Oh, love, when you're in love, to presents, to parties and picnics 
you treat her, 
Oh, love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her ; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to ycur 
bliss, 
You press the dear one to your heart and take from her the. 
parting kiss, 
You bid her good-bye at the door with another sly kiss and two 
or three more. 
Oh, love, etc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
But oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning yourself 
in cold water; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say, please ask father if I 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, etc. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, parties, and balls, perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to lay in the cradle. 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked- for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beautiful twins. 
Oh love, etc.

THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE BOUND TO BE 
RIGHT. 
THERE are thousands of people who think they're so smart, 
That are far too clever by hal f, 
Who oftentimes think they are performing on us, 
When against them we all turn the laugh ; 
They are too wide awake, and you'll make a 
mistake, 
If you let them get out of your sight. 
Don't let them have you, but try to have them, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
CHORUS. 
So always endeavor to be wide awake, 
And trust no one out of your sight, 
Take care of your health, take care of your wealth, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
Advertisements show in the papers each day, 
That a 
firm has got money to lend, 
A 
hundred or so on your own note of hand, 
If you're hard up to them never send ; 
For it's only a 
swindle got up by some rogue, 
Who gets all he can, then takes to flight. 
So from them keep apart, you can do the laugh, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
So always endeavor to be wide awake, etc. 
Now if you get tired of a 
bachelor's life, 
I 
hope now, young men, you'il take care, 
For to make this arrangement with your better half, 
To your home no relations are there ; 
For you'll find that your mother-in-law will want to be 
At your house from morning till night. 
When such is the case, close the door in her face, 
For that's where you're bound to be right. 
So always endeavor to be wide awake, etc. 
SIX MAGNIFICENT BRICKS. 
As sung by JOHNNY ROACH. 
MYSELF and my friends once, thinking there'd be no harm, 
Went for a 
walk down town, arm- in-arm, 
The night it was dark, the street it was very calm, 
When we went out for a 
spree. 
Said Jones, now do what I 
tell you, boys, hurrah, hurrah, 
Louder still, for that ain't half a 
noise, hurrah, hurrah. 
Now we'll strike up the bagpipes all the way and let tise people 
see, 
That we six magnificent bricks have made up our minds for a 
spree. 
29 
CHORUS. 
Ah, ah, ah, fole da doodle duni, 
ah, fole da doodle dum, 
Ah, ah, ah, fole da doodle dum, 
Fole da doodle dum da. 
Through Broadway, up Grand street, and down the same, 
Just like jolly cocks sure enough on we came; 
A 
lot more fellows all joined in our little game, 
As we went out for a 
spree. 
Here we stopped for a 
minute to bawl, hurrah, hurrah, 
The others replied at once to the call, hurrah, hurrah; 
Then we struck up the bagpipes once again to let the people see, 
That we six magnificent bricks had made up our minds for a 
spree. 
ah, ah, etc. 
Going along we went down a 
narrow street, 
A 
party of coppers out marching we did chance to meet ; 
They took us to the station house just by the way of a 
treat, 
To heighten the joy of our spree. 
But we were determined to keep up our pluck, hurrah, hurrah, 
So we gave another by way of good luck, hurrah, hurrah! 
Then we struck up our bagpipes in our cell, to let the coppers 
see, 
That we six magnificent bricks had made up our minds for a 
spree. 
Ah, ah, all, etc. 
The other chaps locked in the station began to shout, 
Inspector he couldn't make out what the row•was about; 
He ordered the coppers again to turn us out, 
And not come in there for a 
spree. 
We were shoved out of the station house door, hurrah, hurrah, 
So just for joy we gave one cheer more, hurrah, hurrah ; 
So home we went with the bagpipes to let the people see, 
That we six magnificent bricks had made up our minds for a 
spree. 
Ah, ah, ah, etc.

IN 
dreams, sweet dreams I 
see again 
A 
spot so dear to me, 
Where those I 
parted from in pain 
Still linger lovingly; 
Where oft in childhood's sunny hours 
I 
fondly lov'd to roam— 
A 
sweet green spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home; 
A 
sweet green spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home. 
There is no place like our native land, 
I 
care not where we stray; 
O'er mountain steep or valley deep, 
On ocean's pathless way; 
My heart yet turns with fondness back 
Across the raging foam. 
To that fair spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home; 
To that fair spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home. 
One hope still lingers in my heart— 
Gives zest to all my joys— 
Once more to see again the home 
Where we were girls and boys; 
A 
mother's form in age bow'd down, 
Still on the earth cloth roam, 
In that green spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish home; 
In that green spot on Erin's shore, 
My dear old Irish borne. 
" 
MAN, KNOW THYSELF." 
As sung by M ASTER GEORGE 
3.1 IINNAT. 
LET each man learn to know himself; 
To gain that knowledge let him labor, 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his ne4thbor ; 
how lenient our own faults we view, 
And conscience's voice adaptly smother; 
But oh bow harshly we review 
The self-same errors in another. 
Let each man learn to know biniseb' ; 
To gain that knowledge let him labor. 
Improve those failings in himself 
Which he condemns so in his neigh bor. 
And when you meet an erring one, 
Whose deeds are blameable or thoughtless, 
Consider, ere you cast the stone, 
If you yourself be pure and faultless; 
Oh ! list to that small voice within, 
Whose whisperings oft make men confounded, 
And trumpet, not another's sin— 
You'd blush deep if your own were sounded. 
Let each man, etc. 
Or in self-judgment if you find 
Your deeds to others are superior, 
To you has Providence been kind, 
As you should be to those inferior; 
Example sheds a 
genial ray 
Of light that men are apt to borrow; 
So first improve yourvlf to- day, 
And then improve you; friends to- morrow. 
.t each man, etc. 
The hour is past to fawn or crouch 
As suppliants for our right; 
Let word and deed unshrinking vouch 
The banded millions' might ; 
Let them who scorned the fountain rill, 
Now dread the torrent's roar. 
And hear our echoed chorus still, 
We're Paddies evermore. 
What though they menace suffering men, 
Their threats and them despise ; 
01. promise justice once again, 
We know their words are lies; 
We stand resolved those rights to claim 
They robbed us of before, 
Our own dear nation and our name, 
As Paddies evermore. 
Look round— the Frenchman governs France, 
The Spaninard rules in Spain. 
The gallant Pole but waits his chance 
To break the Russian chain; 
'The strife for freedom here begun 
We never will give o'er, 
Nor own a 
land on earth but one— 
We're Paddies evermore. 
That strong and single love to crush, 
The despot ever tried— • 
A fount it was whose living gush 
His hated arts defied. 
,[1] 
PADDIES EVERMORE.—{CONCLUDED. 
'Tis fresh, as when his foot accurst 
Was planted on our shore, 
And now and still as from the first, 
Were Paddies evermore. 
What reek we though six hundred years 
Have o'er our thraldom rolled, 
The soul that roused O'Connor's spears, 
Still lives as true and bold ; 
The tide of foreign power to stem 
Our fathers bled of yore, 
And we stand here to-day, like them,, 
True Paddies evermore. 
Where's our allegiance ? 
With the land, 
For which t ey nobly died: 
Our duty ? 
By our cause to stand, 
Whatever chance betide; 
Our cherished hope ? 
To heal the woe3, 
That rankle at her core; 
Our scorn and hatred? To her foes, 
Like Paddies evermore. 
The hour is past to fawn or crouch 
As suppliants for our right; 
Let word and deed unshrinking vouch 
The banded millions' might; 
Let them who scorned the fountain rill, 
Now dread the torrent's roar, 
And hear our echoed chorus still, 
We're Paddies evermore.

How long to me the time will be

And nourish me, and cherish me for life ; 
Oh I

I 
Axt a 
jolly Dutchman, 
From Yarrnany I 
came, 
And if you wants to find me out, 
Fritz Donderbeck's my name. 
The reason I 
came ouf this place, 
Is to told you of a 
spree 
Trot happened to a 
fellow called Hans, 
And an another one—do'ts me. 
Hans and his gal was married, oh, 
I 
bet you five dollars dat was so, 
And all dem fellows from down below, 
Come right away quick to the spree. 
There was Gotleb and Mike, 
And Wigenstein and crazy Ike, 
There was big nose Jake the fool, 
And Openheimer and me. 
Openheimer he got drunk, 
And come down on his head ker-plunk, 
Just as Gotleb got him on his knees, 
They both fell down in a 
plate of Dutch cheese, 
Hoop la, set 'em up again, 
Knock 'em down again, set ern up again, 
Donder vedder set ' ern up again, 
Drunken Dutchmen was we. 
I 
tell you we had lots of fun, 
And plenty lager beer ; 
Fritz Ileuzenbaum, oh, he got mad, 
And tried to bite off my ear. 
I 
got so mad like everydin7, 
Ond I 
grab him by the head, 
Ond I 
stab him with a 
pretzel 
'Till I 
thought he was gone dead. 
We kicked up a 
devil of a 
row just then, 
Row just then, row just then, 
When in came four big policemen 
And wanted to take me. 
THE JOLLY DUTCHNIAN.—Continued. 
I 
said all right, 
We was only fooling because he was tight, 
When they said go ahead 
And give us a 
glass of beer. 
The policemen then, youst for spite, 
Eat so much switzer they all got tight; 
I 
tell you it was a 
hunky old night, 
And we didn't go home 
'Till they put out the light ; 
Each mock, flock, set 'ern up again, 
Knock ' em down again, set ' ern up again, 
Dunder blitzen, set 'em up again, 
Zwei glass of bier for two. 
I 
danced with a 
gal 
At the ball that night ; 
Her name was Katarine, 
The reason dat I 
like dat 
Is because she likes benzine, 
She has a 
gum bile on her nose, 
And a 
bunion on her ear. 
And a 
mond so big, I 
take my oath, 
She can swallow a 
keg of beer. 
Oh, I 
tell you, she's a 
hunky gal, 
A 
hunky gal, a 
hunky gal, 
I 
tell you she's a 
hunky gal, 
And she's going to-rnarry me. 
I 
invite you all to come and see my Katerine, 
Don't stay, for we expect you all to see. 
Katerine can easy be found, 
For she only weighs three hundred pound. 
Oh, don't you wish dot you was me ? 
To have such a 
nice little girl like she, 
Oofety gufe, you know how ' tis myself, 
You know how ' tis myself, (Repeat.) 
Oofety gufe, you know how ' tis myself, 
You know how the old thing works.

No sooner had I 
bought it than to work she did begin, 
And all day long I 
had to hear that horrid whirring din; 
gently reprimanded her, and told my Mary Jane, 
if I 
heard that noise too often, it would surely turn my brain. 
You must know that I'm an author, and by writing make my brean. 
And to write well you want silence, and a 
cool collected head; 
So as any noise disturbed me, you can understand my spleen, 
When I 
had to write and listen to the whirr of that machine. 
Cito.— Oh, Mr. Thomas, &e. 
At first I 
swore a 
little swear, and then I 
swore a 
big, 
And then I 
jumped about with rage, and almost danced a 
jig; 
But it never had the least effect, she worked away like steam, 
Sometimes she'd do a 
flounce or tucker, then she'd do a 
seam. 
A 
feeling the reverse of love, almost akin to hate, 
At last came o'er me, and I 
said, my love, we'll separate; 
I'll take my books and papers to some spot calm and serene, 
Where I 
cannot be annoyed by Mr. Thomas's Machine. 
Mr. Thomas, dte. 
It's two months since I 
left her, and I 
certainly must say, 
I 
regret the cause exceedingly that made me go away; 
So mind you all take warning now, by what you've heard and see"-
And don't be over anxious for a 
Thomas's Machine. 
For if it hadn't been for that, my wife would even now 
Be resiiing with her husband, and we'd ne'er have had a 
row; 
And I 
never should have purchased it, if this I 
had foreseen, 
So you see that I 
have cause to hate a 
Thomas's Machine. 
Cho.—Oh, Mr. Thomas, &e.

GET UP AND SHUT THE DOOR. 
COMIC SONG AND CHORUS. 
AT 
candle light John went to bed, 
In pleasant dreams he smiled; 
The loving spouse that he had wed 
Sat singing to his child ; 
It went to sleep and so did she, 
But she woke up at four 
And found, as frightened as could be, 
She had not shut the door. 
CHORUS. 
" 
Oh, John! oh, John! don't lie here and score, 
I 
forgot when I 
came to bed— 
Get up and shut the door." 
The baby took the colic bad, 
And soon began to scream, 
Though very jolly lungs it had, 
It ne'er disturbed John's dream; 
His wife sat up, half scared to death, 
And shook him more and more, 
Still shouting, " John !" at every breath, 
" 
Get up and shut the door !" 
" 
Oh, John! oh, John," etc. 
" 
It is not as it used to be," 
She said—while she did weep; 
" 
I've seen the time you'd die for me, 
But here you lie and sleep 1" 
The bed fell down, and they fell out, 
The babe did louder roar; 
" 
Thieves ! thieves !" the wife began to shout, 
" 
Get up and shut the door 1" 
" 
Oh, John! oh, John !" etc. 
But John still slumbered on serene, 
And here's the moral true: 
When husbands are first young and green, 
Dear wives, they'll wait on you ; 
But when a 
few years they have seen, 
And honeymoons are o'er, 
You'll find out thus, the men won't e'en 
Get up and shut the door. 
" 
Oh, John! oh, John !" etc.

IIE.—Come to me my Liza Jane, 
And we'll get up and get, 
Take de cabin in de lane, 
And we'll be happy yet; 
SHE.—Ephraim, get your banjo, 
And bring de fiddle too; 
Quit dat Ephraim, ticklin' me, 
And 1'11 quit ticklin' you. 
Oh ! quit dat ticklin', etc.

bear 
Surely you must for I'm known ev'rywhere; 
Girls are enchanted when I 
am in view, 
Gants are bewildered and gaze at me too; 
Some criticise me and stare while they say, 
" 
Oh ain't he nobby, that swell of the day !" 
CHORUS. 
I 
am the swell of the day— 
That' s 
what the people all say ; 
Go where I 
will they say to rue still, 
He's a 
genuine swell of the day. 
Now I 
confess I'm a 
little low down; 
How can I 
help it when all thro' the town 
People are praying for times to improve ? 
Still I'm contented and keep on the move— 
Why should I 
grumble when care I 
have none ? 
All my delight is in fashion and fun, 
Friends crowd around me, and wine makes us gay, 
Then they all flatter the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc. 
I 
am accomplished and very refined; 
Once I 
was rich, but my purse has declined ; 
Love is a 
stranger as yet to my heart, 
But from the ladies I 
ne'er can depart, 
They are the cause of my joy and despair; 
None can resist them, so charming and fair; 
Some spoony fellows they drive to dismay, 
But they all cling to the swell of the day. 
I 
am the swell of the day, etc.

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to-day; 
Life is fading fast away; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes! my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone--alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and gold, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below ? 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc.

THE JOLLY FARMING COUPLE. 
Written and sung by the FIELDINGS. 
W E'RE a 
jolly farming couple, 
Who love a 
country life, 
And during the summer season, 
We work both day and night; 
And when our crops are ready, 
To town we'll bring them down, 
Then you can hear us bellow, 
in any part of town. 
CHORUS. 
Pears and potatoes 
Squash and tomatoes, 
Radishes and cowcombers, 
Letis, inyins and corn ; 
Collyflowers and lakes, 
Cabbiges and bates, 
Watermelons and parsnips 
You will hear us cry each morn. 
At ten o'clock each day, 
Our load it is all gone, 
With our money in our fist, 
To our home we go along. 
We a 
drop of whiskey take. 
Our hearts then to revive, 
And when I 
take too much, 
Shure Peggie has to drive. 
Pears and potatoes, etc.

ARRAFI, ladies small, and gentlemen tall,

And I

THE SWEET LITTLE CREATURE. 
AIR.—" Savourneen Deelish." 
! 
well I 
remember that sweet little creature 
That lives in the cot, at the foot of the hill ; 
Whose smiles and good-humor adorn every feature, 
And close by her cot runs a 
murmuring rill. 
Her cot is adorned with sweet woodbine and roses, 
her mouth, when she speaks such perfection discloses— 
Her breath, too, surpasses the sweetness of roses ; 
I'd give all the world, could I 
once call her mine. 
I 
met her, last night. when my heart nigh forsook me ; 
She blushed like the rose as I 
took her hand— 
And sweetly exclaimed : " Sir, I 
think you've mistook me, 
Or if not, your meaning I 
don't understand." 
" 
Believe me," said I, " love, I 
do not mistake thee, 
You alone have my heart, and I 
ne'er will forsake thee, 
I 
pledge thee my word, if it happy will make thee, 
And all for the honor of calling thee mine." 
She quickly replied : " I've a 
father and mother, 
Whose age now demands my tenderest care ; 
They look up to me—I've no sister or brother 
To help me provide them their day's humble fare. 
But if you're sincere, sir, in what you've repeated, 
Oh I 
come to my parents; oh, you'll be kindly treated, 
And with their consent, when my duty's completed, 
The heart I 
possess I'll reply with my hand."

JOE BLOSSOM. 
Written and sung by the FIELDINGS. 
STANDING with a 
lot of bummers, 
In a 
saloon away up town, 
Drinking beer and breaking tumblers, 
And telling the landlord to chalk it down. 
I 
have no friends, I 
live on lunches, 
And in cellars I 
sleep all night ; 
Oh ! what I'd give for a 
few rum punches, 
Just to set my nerves all right. 
CIIORUS. 
Mister, please give me a 
beverage, 
Some stale beer, or a 
whiskey straight ; 
Mister, just say to me tonic, 
To steady my nerves for mercy sake. 
While you drink your gin and brandy, 
And with pleasure home you roll, 
Three cent nips just suits Joe Blossom, 
Won't some one ask me to take a 
bowl 
My clothes are getting kind of seedy, 
My nose with blossoms are in bloom, 
This mournful eye I 
got this morning, 
From my old lunch pard, Michie Muldune. 
Once he was a 
jolly good fellow, 
But to treat me so makes my heart scald ; 
But he never again shall sleep in my cellar, 
Won't some one ask me take a 
bowl ? 
Mkter, please give me, etc.

THE ITALIAN DUKE. 
BANJO SOLO. 
JUST give me your attention and listen to my ditty, 
While I 
sing about a 
gay young chap lately landed in this city, 
This gay young man was of noble birth, at home he was a 
duke, 
And signed himself Signor Musharoon De Cooke. 
Now this Musharooney when first he landed here, 
Found that his few shillings did quickly disappear, 
So he thought he'd raise his wind and try to make it pay, 
By shovelling snow on Broadway at fifty cents a 
day. 
He saved a 
few dollars, when some one did suggest 
That in a 
monk and organ this nobleman should invest, 
So he started out one morning with the organ on his back, 
To grind around the city, but found things very slack. 
The pennies came in very slow, he could not raise a 
cent; 
Next day he started out again on business quite intent, 
When he spied a 
charming damsel sweeping on the street, 
And thought could I 
but have her, my happiness would be com-
plete. 
He SOOD got to know her, called to see her every night, 
But one evening when calling there, was quickly put to flight; 
A 
big six-footer went for him, and ere he was aware, 
Put a 
mansard roof upon him, then kicked him down the stairs. 
Because the gal proved false to him, be took it much to beat, 
So he started home vowing from this cruel world he'd part ; 
He hung his monk up on a 
strap, then put him by his side, 
While Mushareon swallowed the organ, then laid down and

Her name was Selina Belinda Crow, 
And I 
thought her so tender and mild t 
I 
called on her every day ye know, 
And followed her just like a 
child; 
IT MAKES ME ZO AWFULLY.--[CoNcLuDED.] 
I 
poured out m:f 
heart to Belinda Crow, 
Said for her to he end of the world I'd go; 
But she giggled at me and my love, ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild.— Cho. 
I 
bought her a 
beautiful duck one day, 
And a 
basket with eatables piled; 
She said, Tommy, come in the evening, pray, 
And potatoes we'll have with it biled. 
I'll be out all the day, said Selina Crow, 
Come at ten o'clock, then I'll be in, you know. 
That's the night I 
received such a 
terrible blow, 
And it made me so awfully wild.— Cho. 
New trowsers I 
wore that cost fourteen and six, 
Had my hair cut and beautifully iled; 
In the evening I 
called at her house about six, 
As the time I 
thought might be beguiled; 
.r, 
I 
looked ir at the winder, and didn't I 
stare, 
Miss Crow and a 
dapper young man were there; 
They were eating away at my duck, I 
declare. 
Oh it made me so awfully wild.— Cho. 
I 
rushed on the pair like a 
lion, ye know, 
And I'm sure I 
looked awfully wild; 
Crying, oh! you deceitful, you false young Crow, 
But she turned up her nose, and she smiled; 
Then the young man arose and to me he did say, 
With his mouth full of duck for which I 
did pay, 
That young lady's my wife, we were married to-day; 
Oh, it made so awfully wild.—Cho. 
Said I, You're a 
swindler and cheat, Miss Crow. 
Said her husband, I 
say, draw it mild; 
Then he kicked me right into the street, ye know, 
And it made me so awfully wild 
I 
certainly thought they were very unkind, 
And I 
think that they might have enquired if I'd dined; 
I 
get mad even now when it crosses my mind, 
knd it makes me so awfully wild.— Ch,o.

RILEY. 
As 
Sung by THE FIELDING& 
HE.—OH ! 
Judy dear, I 
feel so queer, 
When e'er I 
think about you, 
Both day and night, you're in my sight, 
I 
cannot live without you; 
A 
pig, a 
cow, a 
sheep I've got, 
A 
house to keep you dryly, 
So say the word, and like a 
shot, 
I'll make you Mrs. Riley. 
Ritidifolol-ritidifolol, etc. 
SHE.—
ow, Mr. Pat, get out of that, 
With your silly botheration, 
For when you talk to me like that, 
You fill me with vexation ; 
Although you've kissed the blarney stone, 
You can't coax me so slyly, 
I'd rather still be Miss Malone, 
Than Mrs. Judy Riley. 
Ititidifolol, etc. 
HE.—I 
know the reason very well, 
To my offer you're no taker, 
You've fell in love with Mickey Ball, 
The wooden-legged shoemaker; 
But let him mind his from this, 
When next I 
catch him hobbling, 
I'll give him such a 
thump of this, (
Shows Stick.) 
By jabers it will spoil his cobbling.

MR.

RILEY.—Continued. 
SHE.—Although he's lame—he's lots of cash, 
And a 
man of great discerning, 
He's got sweet taste. 
HE.—The ugly baste, 
I'll spoil him for his learning. 
SHE.—When I 
am his, without mishap, 
Like doves we'll live together. 
HE.—IIe'll wollop you with his cobbling strap, 
And you'll never want for leather. 
Ritidifolol, etc. 
SHE.—NOW, Mr. Pat, just hould yer gab, 
Your speaking does not please me, 
Some one would think, to see your tricks, 
That love had made you crazy. 
HE.—You've hit the nail right on the head, 
Now don't be acting slyly, 
Take that ! (kisses iler) and in a 
jiffy say, 
You'll be Mrs. Riley,

At coaxing your so clever, 
And since you do so much insist, 
Why I'll be yours forever.

JUDY AND DARBY. 
Written and Sung by THE FIELDING'S. 
On, here we are as you can plainly see, 
A 
happy Irish couple just from across the sea. 
We left ould Ireland four weeks ago to day, 
For the city of New York in the State of America. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, Judy! oh, Darby! 
I 
hope the time we'll see, 
When old Ireland, like America, 
Shall wave the banner Of the free ; 
Oh, Judy! oh, Darby! 
Hurrah for the old sod, 
We'll stick as close together, 
As the turf that's in the bogs. 
'Twas hard to part from poor ould Ireland 
Where we saw the first light of day, 
But the rent and taxes and the famine, 
It drove us all away. 
Oh, Judy ! Oh, Darby ! etc. 
Oh next election I 
run for Congress, 
Arrah, pon me sowl, Darby, that's the time I'll dress, 
Arrah, why not, Judy, I'll make money by the pail, 
Sure I 
never knew a 
congressman but what knew how to stale. 
Oh, Judy I 
oh, Darby! etc. 
But if Ireland bad a 
President, darling, 
And a 
Congress of her own, 
Free from tyrants like America, 
Sure ' tis that we'd make our home. 
Oh, Judy ! oh, Darby! etc. 
TWO GREENHORNS. 
Written and Sung by THE FIELDINGS. 
W E'RE what yees call greenhorns, 
We're only just landed, 
From the city of Dublin, 
Afar over the sea ; 
Though to be called green, 
We will not stand it, 
Tho' foolish we look 
We know all your way. 
CHORUS. 
Tho' our native land ' tis green, 
Oh, that's no reason why 
That we should be called the same, 
Remember that, me boys. 
'Twas not want nor starvation 
That brought us amongst you, 
As from our appearances 
That you can see. 
For at home we had plenty, 
'Tis the truth that I 
tells yees, 
But we longed for to see, 
This land of the free.

COMIC DUET. 
As Sung by TEE FIELDNIGS. 
Ire—Now Mrs. B. come tell to me, 
Why have you stayed away 7 
The fire is out, the house is cold, 
And you've been out all day. 
She—To please you, sir, as you infer, 
The little fact I'll mention, 
I 
was out to- day with Mrs. Stone, 
At the Women's Rights Convention. 
Oh! whack, fal de ral, etc. 
He—What is this Women's Convention ? 
Pray tell me if you can. 
She—Why it is to place the women 
On equality with the man ; 
We are to vote, hold office too, 
All kinds of lines pursue, 
And if the men, stay out all night, 
Why the women can do it too. 
Oh ! whack, fal de ral, etc. 
Ere—When that law's pass'd—what will we do ? 
Pray tell me if your able, 
She—Why stay at home, and keep the house, 
And likewise rock the cradle, 
Poke up the fire, and scrub the floor, 
Clean the knives, the forks and spoons 
lie— My dear, please give me your skirts, 
And you take my pantaloons. 
Oh ! whack, row de dow, etc. 
hie—Now dearest wife, just list to rue, 
One little fact I'll mention, 
I 
will stay home if you will keep 
From Women's Rights Conventions. 
She—No more going out, to see your aunt, 
Or round " Free Lunches' " roam, 
But stay at home with me, my dear, 
lie—And tend to little things at home. 
Oh! whack, fal de ral.

O'ER THE HILLS AND DALES SO GRAND 
Written by E. 
DAVIS, expressly for JENNIE H UGHES. 
I 
CAME from dear ould Ireland with very little money, 
I 
crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see, 
I've heard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate the wonders which I've seen 
Of the hills and dales so grand, that's seen in Paddy's land, 
The boys and girls of our dear Isle, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting, car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's the " Dar,gle" and the " Devil's Glen," in the County 
Wicklow, 
The sweet Lakes of Killarney, in Kerry County too, 
Not forgetting " Blarney Castle," you all know what I 
mea n 
now, 
For there of course the boys all go, to kiss the Blarney stone.

Oysters and wine— 
On Broadway, on Broadway, 
There's such beautiful girls, 
With such sweet, pretty curls, 
Out on Broadway, on Broadway, 
There's where I 
reside when— 
By Killarney's lakes and fells, 
Emerald isles, and winding bays, 
Mountain paths and woodland dells, 
Memory ever fondly strays— 
Marching through the park, 
Marching throtigh the park, 
You hear the drum go rum, turn, tutu, 
As you go through the park. 
Marching through the park, 
Marching through the park, 
You hear the— 
Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Pleasing, teasing, darling girls; 
You love one and all, both great and small, 
Beautiful, beautiful— 
Eyes of the past, looking in mine, 
Thoughts of the past fond and dear, 
Eyes that forever look in mine; 
Dearer by far than— 
Old dog Tray that was ever faithful, 
And though grief could not drive him away, 
He's gentle, he's kind ; his tail hangs— 
Way down upon the Swanee River, 
Far, far away—there's where my heart is 
Turning ever, there's where the old folks— 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen, 
Come back a.2.-ain to the land of thy birth, 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen, Mavourneen,

THAT bye-words of the past are good 
Of course you'll not deny; 
Though most of them have been in song, 
To find one more I'll try; 
The thought, I 
have it right away-
You see my mind's not still— 
The new bye- word is simply this: 
Work, boys, work with a 
will. 
CHORUS. 
Work, boys, work with a 
will; 
Never despair, never stand still, 
But work, boys, work with a 
will, 
Striving to get up the hill. 
You've often seen the little bee 
Improve each shining hour, 
And noticed too how eagerly 
It skips from flower to flower, 
Distilling honey in its hive, 
Was ne'er known to be still; 
Now there's a 
good example, boys; 
Work, boys, work with a 
will. 
Work, boys, etc. 
Perhaps upon the road of life 
Many a 
man you'll find, 
Who needs encouragement in work, 
Though lazy not inclined; 
Speak to him a 
few cheering words— 
Kindness never does kill; 
Your words will have a 
good effect; 
He'll work, yes, with a 
will. 
Work, boys, etc.

DARBY.—I

And with lots of friends to greet us, 
And to potheen freely treat us,

So then farewell to poor ould Erin,

God be with you dear ould Ireland, 
We ne'er shall see thee more. 
Then hurrah for the stars and stripes, 
The stripes, the stripes, 
That gives every man his rights, 
His rights, his rights. 
And for them I

Then how happy we will be. 
Our hearts will both be light and free, 
With a

We will stick as close to one and other, 
As a

We'll dance and sing and drink potheen, 
Washed down with a

treats upon every topic incidental 
to the experience of a

reader in the details of commercial correspondence, the subject matter of these 
specimen letters embrace all points of interest to the general trader. 
Prominence has been given to banking, and the relationship between bank. 
era and their dealers, inasmuch as hundreds of thousands or' persons main-
taining accounts of deposit and discount, are in ignorance of the duties of 
bankers and of the the rights and privileges of the dealer. 
To the body of the work has been appended :-
1. A Glossary of the Technicalities of Commerce, or terms employed by mer-
cantile mim at home and abroad, as a 
peculiar and distinetive language not

2. A table of moneys in which mercantile accounts are kept in various

3. Several forms of important documents not to be round in a
