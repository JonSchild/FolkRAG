BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES 
CHARLES W iLTERS 
was born in Cardiff, South Wales, May 17, 1849, and with his 
parents came to this country when five years of age. 
He 
made his first appearance in the show business in 1865, as a 
tumbler and contortionist, 
After traveling with several circus 
companies he went to the war, and on returning to the profes-
sion, he thought by introducing tumbling in a 
song and dance 
'it would be a 
novelty, and at once acted upon this idea, and 
met with great success all over the western country and re-
ceived a 
large salary for his gymnastic song and dance, (of 
which he is the original). 
He made his first appearance in 
New York at Newcomb and Arlington's Minstrel Hall, Broad-
way and 28th Street, thence to Pastor's Opera House and 
Howard's, Boston, and played engagements all over the Conn-
• 
try receiving great credit, until he met with John W, Sheppard, 
professionally known as 
J. W. MORTON, 
who was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, May 9th, 1849; his father, 
James S. Sheppard ( born in New York City, was a 
theatrical 
actor and also a minstrel manager before John's birth) settled 
in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Morton made his first appearance on any 
stage Oct. 13, 1857, at the age of 8 
years, with a 
traveling 
company on a 
boat built for a 
minstrel show, called the Tam-
bourine. 
Tim Woodruff was a 
member of the company, John-
nie appeared in song and dance as Young Bob Ridley ( which, 
by the way, was written by A. J. Leavitt) and a 
jig. 
For a 
child he was then considered wonderful. 
Morton remained 
with this party eight months, and then returned home and went 
to school until 1864, when he volunteered to do a 
song and 
dance at the National Theatre, Cincinnati, Ohio, for Mr. Geo. 
Edeson's benefit, and meeting with such success that he has 
continued to perform on the stage ever since. 
He engaged 
with Chancy Shay's Quincuplexial Troupe, and then in Pitts-
burgh; he played in all the Western Cities and was the partner 
of Charley Sutton almost a 
year; traveled with Arlington's 
minstrels, and then became the partner of William Ashcroft; 
and together Ashcroft and Morton played a 
long and successful 
engagement at 514 Broadway, Union Square Theatre, and 
Globe in New York. 
Mr. Morton has very few if any enemies; 
he is a 
gentleman on or off the stage, and .- liked and respected 
by everybody. 
Walters and Morton's first engagement together was in 
Pittsburgh, for Fred Aims, then to Baltimore, Chicago, St: 
Louis and Boston, where they made their big hit. 
They are a 
great team together, and it seems as though they were cut out 
for each other. A 
better match never was seen, look more alike, 
agree better, and nearer a 
size and age than any ever yet 
known. 
Sung by W ALTERS & M ORTON. 
MY gal, my gal. Fv{ come for to see, 
Cause Pr- cro4 nothing better for to do. 
I've come to sai my Chloe, dear, 
For to driv away de blues. 
My Chloe deal is a 
mighty Itie gal, 
An' we're gwine for tc marry very soon, 
Den we'll all be merry and have a 
dance, 
By de light oh de silvery moon. 
Cuouns. 
We'll sing, [Svmp I 
and dance, [Snip., 
An' will shout ' till de broke ob de morn, 
Den we'll all go to work 
Down in de cotton field, 
By de sound oh de dinner horn. 
My coal black love she's as lively as a 
cricket, 
Shc can sing, she can dance and shout. 
An'.yon ought tc see dal ole mine prance, 
When I 
drive my Chloe out. 
I 
can wash, I 
can scrub, I 
can hoe de corn, 
Pick de cotton—I 
know am very true, 
I 
can rock de cradle, and sing a 
song, 
And bake de hoecake too. 
We'll sing, (36. 
Now white folks all take our advice, 
And remember what we say, 
Get married all, as we have done, 
For we feel so good to day. 
With Chloe sitting by my side, 
I'm as happy as a 
king, I 
know,, 
So we'll tap the banjo and sing de chorus, 
And bid you all adieu. 
We'll sing, Sck,. 
As sung with great applause by W ALTERS & MORTON. 
OH here we are a 
couple of gay colored darks, 
That are out on a 
sort of a 
spree, 
We ain't very particular about the cut of our rig, 
As you eun undoubtedly see. 
But we'll hoop you up a 
dish 
Of the loveliest style of two mokes with cream colored 
skins, 
For two gayer darkies you never will find, 
Than Gay Torn and Jerry. the twins. 
CHORUS. 
For so happy we feel, [srme.] 
From head to heel, 
For two gayer darkies you never will find, 
Than gay Tom and Jerry the twins. 
But now we've resolved to settle in life, 
That's if two charmers we can find, 
Two darling little wives, that will just suit our taste, 
But they must be both loving and kind; 
So girls open your eyes and go in for a 
chance, 
For it's talent, not beauty, that wins 
And never say no, when you're once asked to dance, 
With Gay Tom and Jerry the twins. 
Fonso happy we feel, 16c.

EBONY JOE. 
Composed by J. W. MORTON. 
Sung by W ALTERS 
MORTON 
OH white folks attention pay, 
And listen to what I 
say, 
I'm a 
loose and careless nig, 
As you perceive. 
I 
can dance and I 
can sing, 
I 
can do the pigeon wing, 
I 
can sling myself 
With all the rest, you bet, 
CHORUs. 
They call me Ebony Joe, ho I [Svmp,] 
Because I'm not slow, don't you see? 
I'm just oil from the can, 
I'se a 
happy colored man, 
And they call me Ebony Joe, 
Oh, dat's my name, 
Oh, to sing is my delight. 
On some quiet night. 
When all the other figs are gathered 'round. 
Oh, I 
sing about my love, 
She's a 
cream-colored dove, 
Kase we'se gwine to get hitched 
For life, in a 
week or two. 
They call me, 
AT A 
SATURDAY MATINEE. 
As sung by W ALTERS & MORTON. 
I'M deep in love with a 
pretty little blonde, 
I 
met one afternoon, 
I 
watched her smile and caught her eye, 
My heart was gone quite soon; 
then essayed to speak to her, 
And thus she answered me: 
Oh is it not a 
pleasant time 
At a 
Saturday matinee. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, yes, I'm caught in cupid's snare. 
I 
am to you, I 
do declare, 
For she is gay and pretty, too, 
As one would wish to see, 
Is this pretty little blonde I 
met just so, 
At a 
Saturday matinee. 
I 
walked with her and saw her home, 
And pressed her hand, oh, my i 
And promised that I'd call again, 
Before a 
week passed by. 
'Twas Thursday night that I 
did go 
To meet this charming blonde, 
I 
then declared to love her true — 
And ever to be fond. 
Oh yes, &c. 
Again I 
went dressed in my best 
This charming blonde to see, 
I 
popped the question boldly out, 
At a 
Saturday matinee. 
She answered yes, but then be sure, 
And you must promise me, 
To take me when I 
to go 
To a 
Saturday Matinee.

OSIAPITODOSIAPINKROOTMORIA. 
As sung by the Monarchs W ALTERS & MORTON. 
OH there is a 
girl I'll tell you of 
Who all you people know; 
When first we met, I 
believe ' twas Christmas Day, 
Oh so merrily she sailed around 
And smiled on me so true, 
I 
golly, boys, she stole—she stole my heart away; 
She looked at me, I 
winked at her 
So loving and so shy, 
And ot all the pretty yaller gals was ever in this town, 
'Twas my Osiaphodosiapinkrootmoria. 
Oh the next time that I 
met with her 
'Twas at the Minstrel Hall; _ 
She wore a 
calico silk, a 
sunflower waterfall, 
A 
little alligator hat that roosted on her nose— 
Oh, gracious me, didn't she wear good clothes! 
Her eyes are bright, they shine at night, 
She filled my heart with pain, 
The one at first sight captured me 
And caused me to sigh, 
'Twas my Osiaphodosiapinkrootmoria. 
Oh the last time that I 
saw this girl 
'Twas at the masquerade; 
I 
danced with her until the ball was o'er, 
I 
asked if I 
could see her home? 
She answered with a 
smile— 
I 
felt as I 
had never felt before— 
She took my arm, we walked along, 
To her house we came very nigh, 
Oh she squeezed my hand and bid farewell, 
As through the gate she slid, 
Did my Osiaphodosiapinkrootmoria.

FLIRTING IN THE TWILIGHT. 
As sung by W ALTERS & M ORTON, With success. 
OH I'm so very fond of roving 
When the stars are in the sky, 
And a 
heart so true and loving 
Often meets me on the sly. 
The sweetest words she whispers— 
And her eyes are sparkling blue, 
And what she tells, I'm very sure 
I'll never tell to you, oh. 
We wander where the shadows fall, 
Her beaming eyes they are my light, 
Of joys we meet it beats them all, 
This flirting in the twilight. 
CHORUS. 
Oh my heart kept going pit-a-pat, 
I 
scarce could tell what I 
was at. 
We wander in the shadows 
But her beaming eyes they are my light, 
Of joys we meet there's none so sweet, 
• 
As flirting in the twilight. 
Oh she called me pet and aeare,st, 
I 
could not tell you half, 
And she said I 
was the nearest; 
Then I 
laughed a 
little laugh, 
12 
My heart is in her keeping, 
For .she has stolen it I 
know, 
She said I'd make a 
very sweet 
And fascinating beau, oh. 
'Twas darkness in the pleasant air, 
Her beaming eyes they were my light, 
I 
kissed before she was aware, 
While flirting in the twilight. 
We wander, &c. 
Oh I 
never shall forget her 
Or her bewitching way, 
Near the place where first I 
met her 
I 
wander every day; 
My arm I 
kindly offered 
And she offered me her hand, 
I 
said I'd make my darling one 
'file happiest in the land, oh, 
We wander in the darkness yet, 
Her beaming eyes they are my light, 
My heart was caught in cupid's net, 
While flirting in the twilight. 
We wander, &C.

MY LITTLE VERBENA, 
L !• r 
AIR.—Hicodemus, by W. Rupert. 
Sung by W ALTERS & M ORTON. 
I'M going to tell you of my girl, 
Oh, Verbena ! 
She'd eyes like diamonds, teeth like pearls, 
And the honey from her lips 
Like the dew-drop gently falls, 
I 
intend to claim her some day. 
And then I'll happy be, and then I'll happy be 
We met at the gay mabelle, 
And we danced so merrily. 
CHORUS. 
Oh little Verbena, my Verbena 
The arst day i,hat we met, 
_I fell in love with you at sight, 
The time Ill never . orgeit. 
ve you now, and always shall, 
As long as ever 
can; 
Don't leave me now, verbena dear, 
For that awful circus man. 
ily love to her I'll ever sing, 
Oh, Verbena ! 
I've purchased her a 
wedding ring, 
A 
bran new parasol 
And a 
set of auburn curia, 
And now I'm sure she'll have me. 
And never more will look 
At the chaps with spangled trunks, 
Who turn flip-flaps, giant swings, 
And jump through paper hoops. 
Oh little Verbena, ,V,c. 
Them circus chaps are awful 'cute, 
Oh, Verbena ! 
And tell things that they hadn't ought, 
And look so awful 'lobby 
As they ride around the ring. 
But don't believe what they say, : 
For you are the world to me, 
That's what I 
think of thee, 
And next Sunday we'll get married,, 
And then we'll happy be. 
(CHORUS. 
(Little Verbena, my Verbena i• 
Then you'll be my bride; 
work and toil, attend to you,, 
And be ever by your side. 
LNo circus chap or tumbler bold, 
Can e'er you from me take, 
For it they tTY I'm very sure 
,They'll make a 
grand mistake., 
_ 
By NED HARRIGAN, for Walters SL 
Morton. 
WE'RE a 
loose and careless pair of figs, 
We're honey from the comb, 
We twist our legs in reel or jig, 
And dislocate the bone. 
Our understanding are immense, 
Just listen to the sound, 
We've got a 
heap of common sense, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
CHORUS, 
So watch this curlicue, [ Symp.] 
Oh ain't it fun for you, [ SvmP.] 
For with a 
bound we bounce around, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
The peculiar vibrations, 
That's just below the knee, 
Causes a 
sensation 
Which creates a-jility, 
It raises dust and makes a 
noise, 
And lays things loose around, 
Here's what knocks— electric shocks, 
That's where we both grab ground. 
So watch this 
To our lady friends we did intend 
To say a 
word or two, 
If nothing more than an-revoir, 
Or gins how do you do. 
But we know they will excuse us, 
And won't give us a 
frown; 
For among the dears we have no fears, 
Of losing any ground. 
So watch this, .tc.

ONE pleasant noon I 
sallied forth, 
My darling one to meet, 
The glittering dew was on the leaves, 
And the sun was shining sweet, 
And as we Fit00(1 within the glade, 
From noise and strife quite free, 
Near by we used to tell our love, 
Beneath the greenwood tree. 
Crion.us. 
Yes, indeed, I 
must confess 
On her depends my happiness, 
Elvira is a 
darling, 
And truly so to me, 
I'll ne'er forget where first we met, 
Beneath the greenwood tree. 
Her name it is Elvira Jane, 
That name sounds sweet to me, 
My wife I 
intend to make this dear, 
If thus to me she'll be. 
As merry moments they pass by, 
Her heart to judge is free, 
I've popped the question to my love, 
Beneath tho greenwood tree. 
Yes, Sze. 
She promised then to be mine, 
We've fixed the happy day, 
I 
shall take her to my heart, 
Just one week next Sunday. 
Down in the littleNtrysting place, 
Our wedding is to be, 
There where first we told our love, 
Beneath the greenwood tree.

To speak to her I

We met about half way, 
Says I 
my dear, what brings you here, 
And what have you to say?

She asked me if I'd wed, [symP.]

FRISKY SALLY GRAY. 
AIR.—M aggie May. 
By .1. W . 
M ORTON. 
THE Spring has skedaddled, July had come, 
And the chickens had ceased to lay, 
DOW11 by a 
puddle in Central Park, 
I 
first saw Sally Gray. 
She had a 
nice, bully, glass-eye, 
And was romping all the day, 
And I 
dearly loved, at sight, this girl, 
Whose name was Sally Gray. 
CHORUS. 
My frisky, frisky, Sally, Sally, 
Romping all the day, oh ! 
I'll bet my life there's not a 
girl 
Can equal Sally Gray. 
As Sal walked out one afternoon, 
About ten o'clock at night, 
She met a 
tall man dressed in blue, 
Who said that I 
was tight. 
He also said I 
was a 
beat, 
My bills I 
could not pay, 
But my purse is in the care of one, 
And that is Sally Gray. 
My frisky, &c. 
In the faro bank for Sally's sake, 
My cash I 
put away, 
That I 
some day to cupid's shrine, 
May take sweet Sally Gray. 
For she's dead gone on me, 
And as time it flies away, 
I 
shall often think of the puddle in the Park, 
Where first I 
met Sally Gray. 
My frisky, &e,

BBIDGET PICKLE. 
At snug by the Monarchs, W ALTERS & M ORTON. 
I 
SUPPOSE you have all been in love 
On some occasion or other, 
So have I, with a 
turtle dove, 
And would have married her, but for her brother, 
Her name is sour, but she is sweet, 
Her cognomen it is Pickles, 
And when I 
ever chance to meet, 
My heart she always tickles. 
CHORUS. 
Bridget Pickle, [SvmP.1 
Thou art so tickle, [ Svmr..] 
*With love's sickle, [Symp.] 
Thou has tickled my heart away from me, 
She'd teeth like cross eyed rows of corn, 
her countenance was vegetation; 
She's turned the heads of every swain, 
And dandelion in creation. 
Her cheek is reddish—like a 
beet, 
Her turn- up nose with talking wiggles, 
With carroty hair and double I 
XX] feet, 
She isn't sour, although she's pickles. 
Bridget Pickle, &c. 
I 
followed her to her parents' house, 
And saw the number on the door, 
I 
silently glided—quiet as a 
mouse, 
To catch a 
glance of her eye once more, 
She looked at me, oh, my ! how sweet, 
It went through my heart like an arrow, 
ill try some day to marry her, 
Tho' all my feelings she's harrowed.

GLASS PUT IN. 
Sung by W ILLIAM ARLINGTON. 
OH my song is of a 
nice young man, 
Who's name was Johnny Glass, 
He was a 
glazier by trade. and the st4mps he made 
As through back streets he'd pass. 
lIestarted in life, with putty and knife, 
And a 
big pane of glass to begin, 
He was fat as a 
hub and fond of his grub, 
And he hallooed out ‘• glass put in." 
He'd rise with the lark, and from daylight till dark, 
He'd trudge through wind and rain; 
By the light of the lamps, he'd count his stamps, 
Next morning he'd be off again. 
'Twas joy to his soul, when he spied a 
hole, 
Or a 
window patched with tin, 
With his eyes rolled up he'd yelp like a 
pup, 
"Do you want any glass put in ?" 
At length he fell deep in love, 
But the fault was not all his own, 
He got shot through the heart with cupid's dart, 
By a 
little Dutch girl half growu, 
With a 
huge large paw she broke his jaw, 
When!his keg was half full of gin, 
As he rolled in the dirt, she cries, where is you hurt ? 
And his answer was " glass put in.;' 
Oh, he made her his frou, but I 
can't tell you how 
They passed a 
honeymoon; 
The pork was oil hot boiling in the pot, 
As he toddled home that noon. 
Years rolled by, three children did cry_ 
Two boys and a 
girl, what a 
sin, 
Oh they christened the last Miss Put in Glass, 
And the boys they called Glass Put In. 
As sung by W ALTERS & M ORTON. 
WHILE walking down the street one day, 
All in the wind and rain, 
I 
saw aretty yaller gal 
A coming up the lane; 
She stopped a 
moment to look around, 
Just then the wind came, whiz ! 
And exposed to me her pretty foot, 
Well, you know how it is. 
CHORUS. 
So listen, now, what I 
tell to you is true, 
She'd a 
catfish mouth, like a 
bursted rubber shoe, 
She's an India rubber yaller gal, 
And wears a 
gingham gown—her maiden name is Liz, 
She threw both feet clean out of sight, 
Well, you know hoW it is. 
offered her my umbarel, 
She thanked me with a 
smile, 
I 
asked how far from there she lived, 
She said ' twas just a 
mile. 
I 
told her I 
would call on her, 
She said, oh, not for Liz. 
11Iy father he would angry be, 
Well, you know how it is. 
That night she ran away with me, 
To the minister's we went; 
He asked me what we wanted, 
And if on marriage we were bent. 
He asked me for the license, then, 
I 
turned around to Liz, 
She smilingly replied to him 
Well, you know how it is. 
So listen, &c. 
So listen, &c. 
JOHNNY KABLUMPS, 
As sung with great applause by W ALTER S 
3; MORTON. 
Oh, look out, fellows, look out, 
And listen to my tale, 
It's not about the walipus, 
Or the hippopotamus whale, 
Nor the jointed crocodile, 
Nor the hump:NI-back camomile; 
But 
sing about my sweetheart, 
And her bewitching smile, 
CHORUs. 
Den it's wake up snakes, [ Symp.] 
For Fse gwine to work my 
jaw, ] St.] 
So just look out for Johnny Kablumps, 
That came from Arkansas. 
Talk about your good things, 
Talk about your bad, 
But were you to see my rosy pink, 
There's no sweeter to be had; 
She's the fairest in the town, 
You would say so could you see, 
Says she loves me with a 
passion, 
And calls me bumble bee. 
Den its wake up, &c, 
Talk about your dancing, 
Just watch her twist her heel, 
And when she gets a 
going, 
Goody, goodness how I 
feel, 
Oh, my heart it flutters then, 
When I 
see her ' witching eye, 
And when I 
squeeze that delicate hand, 
Oh, don't she heave a 
sigh. 
Den it's wake up, &c. 
THE WAY MY DADDY WENT. 
WHITE folks I 
come to tell you, 
Of the days that's past and gone, 
How my daddy used to do, . 
When he was young and strong; 
How when the work was over, 
For the banjo I 
was sent, 
And on the old cabin floor, 
This way my daddy went. 
And when the dance was over, 
And the figs were settled down, 
Sal the good things would bring out, 
And make me pass 'em ' round. 
Then dad brought out the corn juice, 
On a 
gay time they were bent, 
For when once he got warmed up, 
This way my daddy went. 
nose times have passed away, 
Dad's no longer young and strong; 
When he hears the banjo play, 
He thinks of days that's gone. 
He tells the nigs to listen to the 
Happy hours he's spent; 
And when he sees me dancing, says: 
"That's how his daddy went. ' 
The Increase of Thirst. 
I'VE been drinking of late, I've been drinking— 
And tie fact I 
can scarcely deny— 
I've been drinking hot gin and rum-punches, 
But now lin oh iged to go dry! 
Cries the man at the bar: " You're a 
bummer, 
You're something I 
can't understand; 
You've worked like a 
man all the summer, 
And still you've no scrip in your hand. 
It is true you are cheeky and bold, sir, 
All the rum I 
have got you could hold, sir; 
You coirkl drink a 
whole barrel, I'm told, sir— 
Can you wonder the reason you're dry ? 
It is true what you say, Mr. Landlord, 
I 
ought to have scrip laid away— 
A 
great plenty to go on a 
bust, sir, 
And drink cocktails all night and all day: 
But you are like a 
dog in the manger, 
You might treat me, would you but try, 
But to bummers you act like a 
stranger— 
Can you wonder the reason I'm dry? 
For my thirst you don't care a 
thing, sir, 
For the rich man you'll make a 
gin-sling, sir, 
While I 
for my beverage must sing, sir— 
Can you wonder that sometimes I'm dry? 
'Tis true what you say, Mr, Landlord, 
G 
ood liquor is hard to resist; 
just look at that poor, drunken rounder_ 
Few drinks, God knows, he has missed. 
Can you wonder at his weak constitution, 
When be drinks every time that he's asked? 
Soon he'll go to that great institution, 
To the State Farm he'll stagger at last? 
There's his poor wife at home, God defend her I 
With children whose years are quite tender, 
All the bread that they get kind friends send her—, 
Can you wonder they're hungry and dry! 
Can you wonder Pin dry, can you wonder 
When there's so many like me on the beat, 
So many poor thirsty creatures, 
Who \would much rather drink than to eat ? 
There's a 
rounder in the corner sits grinning 
In the broad ° penlight of the night— 
In my pocketsI've not got a 
shilling, 
6r we'd both be exceedingly tight; 
Tle smiles with contempt and derision, 
A 
hot whiskey punch meets his vision, 
But the price of good liquor has risen, 
And still we are forced to go dry. 
Just think while you're drinking your wine, sir, 
That I'm not too prowl to drink rum ; 
While the drinks that you take can't be counted, 
'Tis a 
godsend for me to get one ! 
Go visit the places that I 
take ill; 
Such sights you will never behold. 
When a 
man's broke, his friends all forsake him, 
Though his heart may be made of pure gold! 
While one drink would soon break asunder 
The thirst this poor sufferer is under: 
hear me plead with a 
voice loud as thunder; 
Oh! why will you let me go dry ? 
The original Copy of this song was given to Johnny Roach by 
George Harris, the great English Con:thine. 
I 
sha'n't forget how queer I 
felt when first I 
fell in love, 
I 
had a 
most severe attack through squeezing a 
lady's glove. 
her lovely hand was in it as I 
danced with her so gay, 
I 
thought myself in paradise—it's funny when you feel that 
way. 
Cnottus. 
I 
felt as tho' I'd tumbled into honey, and some one had left am 
all their money. 
The feeling's so peculiar and funny, its funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
took her down to supper, and sat down by her side, 
I 
helped her to the nices, and filled her glass with pride, 
In fact paid such attention, that she viewed me with dismay, 
I 
moved my chair so close to hers, it's funay when you feel that 
way. 
I 
felt as though &-
c. 
We met again one afternoon, and as we were alone, 
I 
plucked up nerve to ask her if some day she'd be my own ; 
She blushed and said go see papa and ask him if I 
may, 
I 
danced the cancan round the room, it's funny when you feel 
that way. 
I 
felt as though &c. 
The old man said that we might wed and so ho crowned ow 
bliss, 
And I 
shall be a 
married man in about a 
month from this. 
It seems as though the time, somehow, would never pass awas 
I 
long to hear those wedding bells, it,s funny when you fee' 
that way. 
I 
feel as though &c.

THE OLD HAT,' 
Written and composed by NED ihumoAN, and sung by 
in his original sketch, entitled INNOCENCE AT HOME 
Am— Going to _Mass lust Sunday. 
MY name is MeNamarra,, 
l'm an American Cit-

I'm proud you know, 
Wherever I 
go, 
I'm a 
true born Irishman ; 
There's one thing, me boys, I'd have you/know, 
And I've come to tell ye that, 
It's the seventeenth of March, 
Whin, as stiff as starch, 
I 
parade with my old hat. 
CHORUS. 
For it's down Broadway I 
march so gay 
Wid Cornelius, Barney and Pat— 
The people shout whin I 
turn out, 
And parade with my old hat, 
That hat was made in Dublin, 
In the Year of ninety-eight; 
'Twas never called in and ye can't begin 
To say it's out .of date.

It's traveled the wide world o
w: 
From Ireland to Bombay, 
And the only time it can be seen 
is on St. Patrick's day. 
Thin give three cheers for the hat I 
wear, 
”efore it is too late, 
And nine more cheers for Patrick's day, 
The day we celebrate. 
And when you see me on parade, 
I'll raise me hat to ye, 
I'll invite ye all to come and call, 
And join my compauy.

BEAUTIFUL 
LOVE. 
As sung by G
EORGE IlAunts, the English comique. 
LO'itl. love, Oh, what is love? • love, ' tis that makes man feel 
so peculiar; 
Oh, love, who does not love a 
Maud, a 
Matilda, a 
Jane or a 
Julia ? 
Love it is, and love alone, that makes the world go round and 
round, 
Love is certain to be known, where a 
woman's to be found. 
When one has the first attack its like raspberry jam, running 
down ones back. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, Icve it is that makes a 
man feel so pe-
culiar. 
Oh, love, beautiful love, a man's but a 
fool when he falls in 
love. 
Oh love, when you're in love, to presents to paities ttnd 
nies yen treat her, 
Oh love, just squeeze her glove, and you feel just as tho' you'd 
like to eat her ; 
But the best of loves must part—then an end comes to your 
bliss, 
You press the deth me to your heart and take from her the 
parting kiss, 
You bid her good-bve,. it the door with another sly kiss and two. 
or three more. 
Oh, love, Sc. 
Oh love, when you're in love every half hour you'd go to court 
her. 
Dia, Oh, love, if she won't love, you talk about drowning your-
self in cold water ; 
If it's all right she'll giggle and say please ask father if J 
may, 
Then you feel so jolly and gay, and tease her till she names the 
day, 
You'll serenade her when she's abed and her dad drops flower-
pots on your head. 
Oh love, &c. 
Oh love, when you've your love out, all the money you have 
you must ladle, 
Servants, dresses, part les, and balls. Perhaps each year a 
cherub 
to hr in the cradle, 
When the honeymoon is past then your eyes are not so blind, 
Your dream was far too good to last and your face grows long 
to find, 
Your looked for happiness begins with a mother-in-law and 
beatiful twins. 
Oh love, J.7c, 
SWF'S ONLY SEVENTEEN. 
Original. HARRIGAN & HART. 
I'M in love I'd have you know, 
And the feeling's very queer, 
They call her darling little Flo, 
Her voice I 
love to hear, 
It's sweeter than the blackbird, 
Singing from a 
tree, 
And only her, upon my word, 
I 
love to go and see. 
C110.RL 
It seems just like a 
dream, 
When first I 
met my queen. 
She's this darkey's honey-comb, 
She's only seventeen. 
Oh the rainbow is :retty In 'to :
icy, 
And a 
sun-shower very pretty too, 
Methinks I 
hear you all reply 
They are very handsome things to -view, 
But perhaps to see this girl you wou11,1 
Say she's the prettiest of J.1, 
If by chance you ever should, 
In love with her you'd fall. 
It seems, &c. 
Her pa I 
went to see, 
And what do you think fie said t 
Wait one year—then he'd agree, 
That she and I 
should wed, 
I 
feel sad now, but never mind, 
I'll wait t.11 the yea: is o'er, 
be so sweet, and twice as kind, 
As I 
ever was beiore.

MY thoughts of a 
girl I 
can't conceal, 
I 
met the other day, 
She'd a 
dainty foot and a 
lovely heel, 
With, oh, such a 
winning way; 
No duck in a 
pond was half so light, 
As she with her careless air, 
The veil she wore was scarlet bright, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my heart pit- pat as she passed me by, 
So beautiful and fair, 
She glanced at ine with her soft blue eye, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
We met again, ' twas in a 
set; 
At the colored waiter's ball, 
As I 
balanced across her eye I 
met, 
I 
really thought I'd fall; 
The music stopped, I 
stepped aside 
To let her pass with care, 
To speak to her I 
really tried, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
! 
my heart, tir, 
Oh what is the use of feeling sad, 
When there's lots of pretty girls, 
In this town yet to be had, 
With plenty 01 silks and curls, 
But she's the only one I 
love, 
I'd tell her if I 
dare, 
she's sweet to me as the turtle dove, 
The girl with the flowing hair. 
Oh! my heart, (

ROGUISH EMALINE, 
Written by Wm. H. 
DELEHANTY. 
l'M as happy as the birds in Spring-time, 
That warble in the air, 
While they hop about from limb to limb, 
For the troubles of the world they little care, 
So, that's the very way I'm feeling, 
The reason I 
will tell, 
I'm in love as you can plainly see, 
With:a captivating roguish little belle. 
CHORUS. 
We first met in the Summer, 
Down by a 
running stream, 
And upon my sacred honor, 
It seems to be a 
dream. 
But I 
love her as you may suppose, 
She's one of sweet sixteen, 
And as pretty as the red red rose. 
Is the roguish little beauty, Emaline, 
Now of all the pretty girls I 
know of, 
There's none so sweet and fair, 
For her eyes are like a 
bright sun-beam, 
And a 
light-brown is the color of her hair. 
- 
41/ 
I 
received a 
billet-doux this morning, 
From one in love I 
ween, 
Which has made me happy all day long, 
'Twas from the little beauty, Emaline! 
We first met, &c. 
In her note she said she wished to see me, 
If the weather it be fine, 
So, this night I'm going to meet my love, 
As I 
live in hopes to make this beauty mine.

BESSY DOON: 
The Sweetest of Them AI 
Written and Composcd by W x. IT. 
DELEITANTY. 
OH! I 
know a 
little maiden, 
By the name of " Bessy Doon," 
And by invitation I 
am going to call; 
And my heart with love is laden, 
Since we met this afternoon, 
When she blushed and said she loved me best of all; 
And she looked just a!,' 
charming--
A 
s

ur a 
psoch rine, ready for to :

I 
couldn't see the harm In—

, her my heart to-day, 
Foril really think she's the sweetest of them all. 
CITORITS 
! fell me why—you wink your eye, 
You roguish little butterfly, 
Or do you know on whom I'm going to call. 
While merrily on every tree 
The little birdies sing to me,— 
Bessie is the sweetest girl of all. 
Now I 
was one of them who thought 
That love was all a 
myth, 
And I 
never gave it any heed at all! 
Cupid s 
quiver struck my heart and 
Wrote a 
verse beginning with— 
Oh ! Bessy is the sweetest girl of all; 
Then I 
felt just as happy 
As a 
big sunflower, 
Nodding in the breezes high and tall. 
Then I 
saw entrancing beauty. 
And I 
felt its tender power, 
For I 
love Miss Bessy Doon the best of all. 
Oh! tell me why, &c. 
011 ! I 
can no longer linger. 
For my time is growing short, 
But I 
hope to meet you all some day again 
And if Bossy is a 
singer, 
Just to have a 
little sport 
cli bring her here to sing a 
sad refrain. 
She will sing a 
sad farewell 
To the ' lobby little chaps— 
That dance in attendance to her call: 
My adieu to every belle, 
For I'll marry soon perhaps, 
Miss Bessy Doon the sweetest of them all. 
Oh! tell Inc why, &c.

I 
KNOW a 
maid who loves me, 
And has my heart in keeping, 
And every clay she proves me 
her love to me is leaping— 
Like dews of summer weeping, 
In tears the bud-rose steeping. 
C110.RUS . 
Sweet Emma's of my life a 
part, 
The sunshine of my eye, 
The love I 
feel within my heart, 
Can never change nor die. 
Buell you chance to meet her, 
Her grace and beauty charming, 
Will make you fondly greet her 
With admiration warming— 
The heart of love alarming, 
But wishes free of harming. 
Sweet Emma's, 
Had'st thou but heard her talking, 
Thine all attention given, 
Or by her side been walking 
That lovely summer even', 
While zephyrs flower breath laden--
Made earth seem part of Heaven. 
But dread the bitter ending, 
If when by her deserted, 
Bereft her sweet befriending, 
'Twere better death had started— 
His round nor leave thee parted, 
Forever broken hearted.

Shake off your slumbers and arise,

The good old man we'll see no more,

He has gone to tbe happy shore,

He's gone and left us darks alone, 
We're all surrounded; 
And Gabriel's trumpet called him home, 
We're all surrounded.

I 
LOVE YOU. 
Sublime Rhyme and Chime.— By Wm. II. DELEHANTIG 
AS I 
strolled out 0116 evening, 
When the silver moon was shin,ing, 
And 
little stars were twinkling, 
Ali in the month of June, 
I 
cnanced to meet a 
beauty, 
So sylph-like, neat and pretty, 
With pouting lips like ruby— 
Beach blossoms in full bloom, 
And as she came up nearer, 
Her sweet face full in view, 
My heart spake like a 
whisper, 
Fair maiden I 
love you, 
CHORUS. 
so-
Oh ? yes, yes, yes, she's all the world to me, 
No, no, no, there's none so fair as she, 
Her bright blue eyes betwiching, 
Had pierced me thro' and thro', 
My heart still breathes a 
whisper, 
Fair maiden I 
love you. 
Tho' strange it may be seeming, 
Her face is ever beaming, 
A 
starlight in my dreaming, 
A 
daisy dipped In dew, 
Ah! could my arms perlieu her, 
like a 
dove would coo her, 
ss 
44z+, 403m6g‘,-;14 
And wed as well as woo her, 
This maiden fair and true; 
And all the wend might envy, 
And wish me ill to do, 
But I 
would still be happy, 
Fair maiden, but with you. 
Oh! yes, yes, yer, 
Ah here I 
have a 
letter, 
What could please me better, 
Now, who can be the writer, 
That hand I 
never knew, 
It says, dear friend, excuse me, 
If as a 
friend I 
choose thee. 
To meet me, don't refuse me, 
This course I 
must pursue; 
I 
can no longer tarry, 
Since first my eyes met you, 
Now, if you wish to marry, 
You'll find me good and true. 
Oh ! yes, yes. yes, (Ccc.

LITTLE DEW DROP. 
Written and Compoed by W M. H. 
DELEIVINT L 
NOW everybody wonders; I'm so happy,_ 
They criticize my gay and airy style, 
But if they new the pretty little beauty 
That thro' at, me the sweetness of her smile. 
Fin sure they Nvould'nt wonder I 
was airy, 
Nor think that I'm in any way to blame 
When I 
say I 
gave my heart up to a 
fairy— 
Yes, "Little Fairy Dew Drops" is her name, 
CHORUS 
Oh ! yes, she's like a 
fairy, 
Blithesome and airy--
Pouting lips of cherry, 
Smiling when we meet. 
Bright eyes when they view me, 
Piercing thro' and thro' me, 
Perfectly under me, 
Dew Drop is so sweet. 
One summer's day we went a 
picking berries, 
So ripe and running wild upon the hill, 
Tiow carelessly we trod upon the daisies 
So anxious were we then the pail to a, 
5v 
And when the pail was full we sat and rested, 
'Twas just because I 
said she needed rest— 
And oh! how very sweet the berries tasted 
With little Dew Drop leaning on my breast. 
Oh! yes, &c. 
I 
told her then my life was very lonesome, 
And bluntly asked her would she be my wife, 
And tho' I 
said, I 
knew I 
was'nt handsome, 
Still, I 
hoped with love to ble;.; her all her life; 
" 
She answered yes," when we were homeward turning, 
ihro' fields where corn was waving high above 
While I 
think to hug or kiss we were a 
learning, 
And no one heard our gentle tale of love. 
Oh! yes, Sze.

LOVELY NANCY BROWN. 
Written by W.m. H DELEJIANTY. 
WHILE walking out one summer day, 
Adown the vale I 
chanced to stray, 
And oh ! the unexpected joy— 
I 
met sweet Nancy Brown so shy. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling and so charming, 
A thousand jetty ringlets--
Hanging glossy down, 
Darling, charming, lovely Nancy Brown-
A 
rose- bud on its tender stalk, 
We met as onward we did walk, 
'Twas fair and sweet and all alone 
But not so sweet as Nancy Brown. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling and so charming, 
Lovely bright eyes laughing 
Never claim n 
to frown, 
Darling, charming, lovely Nancy Brown. 
I 
puli'd the bud-rose from its stem 
And placed in Nancy's hair the gem. 
Then said the rose is sweet and fair, 
But thou art fairer Nancy dear, 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling and so charming., 
Smiling and beguiling 
Blushing-, looking down, 
Dearest, sweetest, lovely Nancy Brown. 
While standing ' neath the apple tree 
Nancy said my wife she'd be— 
Her father in the tree above— 
Fell down and spoiled our blissful love.

She's a 
darling and so charming. 
She's the queen of beanty, 
Virtue is her crown, 
Rarest, fairest, lovely Nancy Brown.

SONG OF JOKES . 
AS I 
walked through the town one pleasant night in spring, 
I 
stood neath the windows to hear the girls sing; 
Oh where, and oh where, has my highland laddie gone 
lie's gone, he's g:one, Os meek as any lamb, 
They took him, yes, they took him to the arms of Abraham; 
Away, away, away down south in Dixie, 
Where the troops are the finest I 
ever did see, 
And the captain with his whiskers, took a 
sly glance at 
Johnny Schinoker, Johnny Schmoker, etc. 
Oh, I 
heard the drum beat and the music so sweet, 
But my eyes at the time caught a 
much better treat, 
For gay and happy, gay and happy, 
We'll be gay and happy still, 
Glory, glory, hallelujah, as we go marching on 
Oh Sallie come up, 
Sallie come down, Sallie come down to 
Maryland, my Maryland, Maryland, my Maryland, 
For ! last thou no feeling to see me kneeling with 
No one to love, none to caress, 
Roaming, alone t 
Iwo' this world's wilderness, 
Oh how can I 
leave thee, how can I 
break apart, 
When sheepskin and beeswax make an awful plaster, 
The more you try to take it off, 
A few days, a 
few days, 
What's the use of sighing, I'm going home, 
To the land of the free and the home of the girl I 
left behind me 
The girl I 
left behind me.

t's those who have never perused the sad story of CRIBLOTTII 
TXXYLE, joyed with her in her early pleasures, sympathised and 
wept with her in her sorrows, &Ad glowed with indignation at the 
wrongs which she suffered from base, calculating villains, an oppor-
tunity is afforded of reading one of the most absorbing works ever 
written, proving " truth stranger than fiction." 
The poet's lines are but a 
just description of the unfortunate 
Charlotte Temple: 
Her form was faultless, and her rafted. 
Untainted yet by art, 
Was noble, just, humane and kind, 
And virtue warmed her heart. 
But, ah I 
the cruel spoiler came—" 
This book, in the language of Mrs. Rowson, " affords a

example that vioe, however prosperous in the beginning, in the 
tra leads only to misery and shame.

The New

A little book has 1 
tely appeared in print at Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison's, 98 Nassa 
street, called "The Little Flirt." We 
cannot 
say that we recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, 
as we think it would only encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately there is enough of it done without any :urther neces-
sity of explaining "how, when and where to do it," and this little „ 
volume would advise and initiate the uncorruuted in practising what 
is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: 
We have lately seen a 
neat little book, bound in morocco, costing 
25 cents, ended " The Little Flirt," published by Messrs. Fisher & 
Denison, 98 Nassau street. 
It gives information of the modus oper-
andi of flirting, and of the meaning of every motion of the hand-
kerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there is nothing at all objec-
tionable in the volume, and its contents might afford some innocent 
amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recommend it to our 
young lady and gentlemen readers. 
The LITTLE FLIRT contains Fourteen Silhouette Illus-
trations.
