B:  I want, I wanted to ask about health and, I'm particularly interested in traditional beliefs and 
practices.  Not just home treatment, but treatment by various specialists [unclear] and all that.  
Interfaces with ah, western establishment [unclear]
T:  Well, here at the M.A.A.  we don't see too much of that.  But I can tell you some of the, well 
just this morning one staff person who came in late and he had called.  Was to take his 
Grandmother to the Monk.  And just before I came in he had arrived.  And apparently she was 
having great difficulty breathing.  But she has now been admitted to the hospital.  And ah, the 
comment was made, "well the Monk didn't help."  And, you know, my feeling is, if the Monk 
makes her feel at ease to enter the western hospital he has helped.  Ah, I know with some mental 
health cases ah, the ah, Solomon Mental Health Center and ah, the Venerable Sao Khon have 
worked together on cases.  Ah, there seems to be no conflict.  Now there might be some issues 
where there might be a conflict, but those that I am aware of ah, there was no conflict there was a
joining together.  We do see some of our ah, students come in and other clients come in ah, where
there's evidence that, you know, cupping had taken place, or coining.  Right.  And ah, we have a 
day care center it's ah, has all American Children, Hispanic Children, Cambodian Children, um 
and ah, we have a Cambodian Aide, who is a mother, two kids.  And ah, one little boy ah, got 
sick, and she pulled out the Tiger Balm.  And this was going to take care of him.  Ah, the then we
have a high schooler who comes in after school to sweep the floors and wash the floors and ah, 
he came in and suddenly felt very, very sick.  And out came the Tiger Balm again before any 
body could do anything.  But, you know, the child had some kind of, either he ate something that
brought this suddenly on.  Or because he was vomiting and so on.  Ah,
B:  The Tiger Balm, what did he do?  Did he rub it on himself or?
T:  On his abdomen.  Because he was feeling sick, yeah.  Yeah.  Now I had you know, if you 
want to use it go, I don't care.  You know.  But ah, just ah, mid-November I, my husband and I 
went on vacation to visit my older son and his wife in Oakland, California ah, and I had been 
bothered with a stiff neck and a soreness and I still have it.  And my daughter-in-law whips out 
the Tiger Balm.  [laughter]  I was so, I said wait till I get back and tell my staff, you know.  But I 
used it and it seems to anesthetize the surface a little bit for a short time.  And it didn't cure 
anything.  But, it relieved the pain so that I could enjoy myself you know.  Or mostly so I could 
sleep at night.  Ah, but ah, so now I have my own little package of Tiger Balm in my purse.  I 
would imagine it would be great because it's like
B:  The Tiger Balm was bought in the stores here?
T:  Yeah, Yeah.
B:  And some other things from Chinese Medicine you have to go to Boston.
T:  Yeah, and I think some of the Vietnamese Doctors that we have, have medications that they 
prepare.  But, I've never really
B:  You mean medical doctors?
T:  Medical doctors, yeah.
B:  Who also use
T:  Use some, yeah, I think the original
B:  Do, you know, who are some of the doctors?
T:  Well, Dr. Nguyen was the first one who was here.  And I think he has some preparations that 
he puts together.  Um, Dr. Tran ah,
B:  Where is he?  Is he down on
T:  He's on Dummer Street.  Again, not far from Joe's, right, right next to ah, the Demoulas Store,
right.  Um, now he used to be on Merrimack Street but he moved into quarters there.  I think they
were larger.  And again very close, one block over is where Dr. Tran has his office.  And as a 
matter of fact you can cut through the Demoulas parking lot through this little alley way and 
you're on Worthen Street.  And that's where Dr. Tran is.  Now the new Dr., when Dr. Tran first 
came to Lowell to take a look.  I think he came from Hartford.  At least he came from 
Connecticut.  And he said my ah, patients  are all moving to Lowell so I've come to take a look.  
And he followed his patients.  Ah, and ah, he came to the M.A.A.  and said I know that it's a 
large Cambodian Community.  I'd like you to help me ah, to recruit a, an office worker nurse, 
who speaks the language.  So that I can communicate more effectively with the patients.  It 
showed he was a very wise business man as well as being a doctor.  And ah, ah, when Dr. Do 
came he also came to the office.  And now we have a Vietnamese Dentist, graduated from Tufts.  
And so her credentials are American.  Um, we've been hoping and we're willing to do what we 
can ah, with the hospitals.  We've talked to the hospitals.  Ah, to try to allow the Vietnamese 
doctors to have access to the services.  Ah, I think, you know, when you think of a patient doctor 
relationship and why the patient goes to the Vietnamese doctor in the first place.  They feel more 
comfortable.  It's a piece of home.  But if the illness is serious enough that the patient must be 
hospitalized.  They have to be turned over to a stranger.  I don't, I don't think that's right.  
B:  They don't understand the customs.  It's touching people.
T:  That's right.
B:  In the wrong spot or,
T:  Yeah.  
B:  Something a western doctor takes for granted as a normal procedure like would really put off,
T:  Well, even if you put the cultural issues aside.  I mean I know that I would feel pretty awful if
a doctor were taking care of me and knew my history and so on.  And suddenly it's very serious, 
you have to go to the hospital and it's a stranger.  Someone I've never seen or met.  So you have 
that trauma piled that anyone would feel.  And on top of that the cultural things.  Ah, we have 
had many calls from the hospital ah, describing, asking us to describe the, a procedure that's 
going to take place.  Because the hospitals have been dragging their heels hiring staff.  They 
insist that the same qualifications have to be there.  They make no allowances that language is 
important.  And so ah, it, it really makes it very difficult for the patients.  Ah, we had two young 
women that came in I believe in the summer of 86.  One had been a mid-wife in Cambodia.  Her 
English was quite limited.  Um, another one had worked in a nursing home in Seattle 
Washington.  And they came East together.  And the one who'd worked in a nursing home.  Sure 
she, everyone has limited English.  But she could communicate quite well in English.  And we 
thought, Oh Boy!  We've got a qualified, she had a certificate from a place in Washington State.  
And ah, the hospital would just be grabbing her up.  No!  We had to go through this long big 
procedure and they weren't interested.  
B:  [unclear].  Hospitals have traditionally not really been, [phone rings in background] 
T:  Right.
B:  [unclear] no matter what culture, anyway, certified or not.  
T:  But the other one was a certified nurses-aide in the United States and still they, they wouldn't 
make allowances.
B:  Is there, is there much home birth?  
T:  Not that I'm aware of.  There's a prenatal clinic at Lowell General Hospital.  The hospital 
that's furthest away.  Ah, so it makes it very difficult.  For a long time Lowell General did not 
have an interpreter in the clinic.  I mean they've just hired somebody not too long ago.  And ah, 
the International Institute in Lowell has an interpreter but, it's a man.  Here this man is taking 
these women and having to interpret things.  Now does he give an accurate picture?  One, 
because he doesn't want to say certain words and things.  And two, can he give an accurate 
picture because it's his client, his patient describing it to him?  Um, my cultural teacher here and 
I went to Middlesex Community College to talk to the teachers in the health professions unit.  To
try to give them some culture.  And when it came to birth, and family planning and that sort of 
thing my, my staff person refused to talk about certain things.  There are certain words he just 
wouldn't use.  And so as he you know, I said to him, O.K., I will do some of this talking and if I 
make a mistake just you know, just nod your head no.  And, you know, his face was red.  His 
head was down cast and it was O.K., if I was saying this thing.  But he couldn't say it.  So, 
[laugh] now there are others where there's no problem.  Ah, one of our recent graduates from our,
our E.S.L. classes.  We have set up in a part time job with the agency across the hall which is 
health works and they have a family planning.  And they have been wanting to hire a Cambodian
lady because they know that they need to service the community.  And ah, Shavun um, was 
game.  She had been a nurse in Cambodia.  She had given I.V.'s course we, she never talked 
about family planning so she's having a learning experience.  And the director said they want to 
train her so they can get her certified para-professional.  Ah, which pleases me very much!  Ah, 
but the line supervisor, the nurse practitioner and the other technicians that she's working with 
have never worked or talked to a Cambodian before.  And so she drops in after work every day 
and she was saying, you know,  "I have trouble understanding them.  They have trouble 
understanding me."  And ah we said, "hang in there."  Then the nurse practitioner and the ah, um,
supervisor came in.  The medical technician came in.  And they said, "we don't know if she 
doesn't understand English.  Can't she come back to school here?"  We said, "no."  She's reached 
her maximum with us.  The next step would be pre-G.E.D.  preparation and getting her G.E.D.  
So they said, "well, we have to do something.  So we don't even know if she understands the 
concept of family planning.  And of course we have to be careful.  Malpractice and so on."  And I
can see their point.  So I said, "look we have some of the materials on different methods for 
family planning written in the native language.  Now why don't we give these to you.  You can 
give them to her.  Tell her how.  And ask her to tell you back in English what she's reading as a 
learning experience."  Well, she happened to see her bosses talking to me.  That afternoon she 
called up.  And it's always more difficult to communicate over the telephone.  Because you don't 
have body language at hand.  Ah, but Shavun had called and said, "what we're they talking 
about?"  I mean she's a smart lady.  So I said, um, went through the thing, and I said, "Shavun, 
it's not your problem.  It's an American problem.  Their ear has to get accustomed to your voice.  
The same way that a parent learns to know what a two year old is saying.  That neighbor down 
the street can't understand but the parent knows.  I know what people are saying.  Their ear has to
learn.  So that they will know."  And, you know, if their talking too fast.  ask them to be, speak 
more slowly.  And we pretty much counseled the, her line supervisor that way too.  Um, now 
there is a gentlemen who was studying to be a doctor in, in Cambodia when the war came.  And 
he is an outreach worker for public health.  But he continues to read medical books.  He's a 
terrific guy.  So I told both Shavun and her supervisors that if there was a question of her ability 
to know the medical content he would speak with her.  And he wouldn't tell them she's incapable 
of learning or, she certainly knows what she's talking about but she can't verbalize it back to you.
But he certainly would tell me.  Since we've known each other for a long time.  And after she and
I had this long conversation on the phone.  I thought there's nothing wrong with this lady's 
comprehension.  We're not even in person.  We're doing it on the phone and she understood every
single nuance that was being put over.  And they really don't have anything to worry about.  If 
they only will be patient.  
B:  Sort of sounds like there's some effort made on health medical establishment to train
T:  Well, very small.
B:  What about the other, what about the other side of the establishment attempting to find out 
about Cambodian customs so that they can understand better how to treat them?  
T:  Well, the Merrimack Valley Area Health Association ah, has, had been asking and now this 
same young man who ah, Nan Hul, who was studying to be a doctor is on their board.  And he 
can give feed back from the community.  To the Merrimack Valley Health Association.  Um, we 
need um, Sally Penreby is on the Department of Mental Health at the State level.  And she's 
Cambodian married to a American.  And she's been doing a lot of work trying to break through 
and get ah, especially for our area here, a special mental health unit.  Southeast Asian Mental 
Health Unit.  And you know, from the time that the planing money came, it's going to be three 
years.  But we hope that's going to be a reality.  That it will eventually be funded.  Um, I think 
when you have something like that you'll have more of an interchange.  Um, public health tries 
to hold cultural sessions ah, for American service providers.  And they tap into, they have a 
network.  Sally's one of the people who frequently is a speaker.  Ah, people from Brighton 
Marine Hospital come and speak on their Southeast Asian Unit and bring some of the culture.  
Um, the Department of Social Services ah, last year had a well, it was only an afternoon ah, 
workshop for local agencies, the Girls Club, the Boys Club, the Y, the Library, the Office of 
Employment and Training they were all invited to come.  And they had a group of panelists.  And
someone started with the history of Cambodia.  Going back to before Angor, Angorwat.  And 
then someone else talked about you know, the problems of the mew arrivals.  And then the 
problems someone  else talked about.  Ah, the problems that come up after the refugees have 
been here awhile.  They have learned to to survive.  They now have food.  They have housing 
and they have ah, heat.  Um, now they're thinking back.  Some of the mental health problems 
that are surfacing, you know, my relative that's still back there.  Ah, I'm sure some of it is similar 
to ah, the, the what is called the survivors guilt.  In hotel fires, things of that type.  Ah, and some 
of it is, the children are becoming American, Americanized and I'm not.  What's going to happen 
to our family unit?  So..
B:  The children are um, I guess are the group [unclear].  I tried to corner four kids in the 
basement of the Temple.  
T:  How old?
B:  Teenagers.
T:  Ah, ha.  
B:  And they were in a fun kind of way, they were poking fun at what was going on upstairs.  
You know.
T:  Yeah.
B:  You know, they were going [making chanting sounds] trying to be cool and stuff.  So I 
wanted to sit down and talk to them.  They didn't, they were very reluctant to do that.  But I think
it's, to be a balance, I really should talk to
T:  Yes, and I think
B:  Do you have any suggestions about where..
T:  Well, I was going to suggest that you might want to talk to Hang Boutcher.  Hang is the
B:  Is he the Temple
T:  He's at the Temple, yeah.
B:  He's the president of [unclear] or the treasurer or something.
T:  Treasurer, right.  Um, now the way I understand Hangs story is that when his family came to 
the United States he was left behind with the Monks.  To complete some studies.  And I don't 
know if it was one of those sacred time periods that you can't leave the Temple until, so many 
days, or so many weeks.  Ah, because he stayed behind too long.  And he's ah, he was ah, one of 
our legal aides in the past and ah, ah, vocational E.S.L.  teacher.  But he finally, he and his wife 
worked, and he had the two jobs.  Ah, they bought a house.  And then her parents came in.  And 
then other members of the extended family.  And I think everyone, you know, I don't know this 
for a fact.  But, I think everyone chipping in to pay the rent.  He could give up working two jobs. 
And he could enjoy his children.  Ah, and I was, we were sorry to loose as a staff person.  But I 
was happy that he was going to have more time with his kids.  Ah, Hang dragged his heals about 
enrolling his daughter in kindergarten.  Because he wanted to push back that tide of, she was 
going to become like American kids.  Um, we finally told him, you know,  now that the child is a
certain age it's against the law to keep her home.  You have send her to school.  And if you 
postpone this you're only going to be hurting her.  Because you're just pushing back time.  You're
not resolving.  You're going to resolve the questions when she goes to school, and when she 
comes home, and how the family deals with that.  That so, don't delay, do it now.  And um, I 
think that he would be able to te, he'd be able to tell you something about the young people.  And
I think he could direct you to some young teenagers who probably are not rebelling, but are 
evolving.  Their American culture combined with their ancestral customs.  
B:  The whole process is very
T:  Yeah, and I, I think you will find that there are different teenagers.  There are the rebellious 
kind who, all teenagers are, right?  They're cutting the apron strings.  And they're doing it, I'm 
going to be cool and I'm going to wear these cloths and so an.  Which upsets their families 
tremendously.  And there are those who are doing it not so dramatically but are evolving and 
blending.  And, and I think you really should talk to both groups.  
B:  [unclear]
T:  Yeah, and I could ask ah, ah, this poor girl, I always, I always go to her, because her family to
me is, is a very special family.  And they're a number of children down to ah, I think the youngest
one is second or third grade.  And ah, the oldest ah, daughter is married, and the oldest son is 
married.  And then comes this girl.
B:  [unclear]
T:  Yeah, you have the whole range, yeah.  And as a matter of fact, it's even broader ranged 
because her father was married before.  And I don't know if he became widowed back, well he 
must have, back in Cambodia.  But he, she has half brothers who are like forty years old.  And 
ah, her father I think understands a little bit of English.  He's legally blind.  Ah, he looks like you 
know, a little old man.  And yet there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in that person, 
tremendous.  And there are times when if, if I have a question about, you know,  we were 
thinking of having a family planning class here.  And the question came up, do we teach the men 
separate from the women?  Do we put them both in the same room, as long as they're husband 
and wife?  Ah, you could talk to a husband and wife together maybe on this.  But, how is the 
husband going to feel about the other lady who's sitting over there, you know?  We ended up we 
never had the class.  Um, ah, but I told this, this girl.  I said, "Rung, would you do me a favor and
ask your father, culturally how should we deal with this."  And the answer came back, you can't 
put the men and women in the same room if you're in Cambodia.  But maybe in America it 
should be tried.  Now this guys like seventy years old.  
B:  Quite an amazing thing.
T:  Yeah, super.  And ah, but I think, you know, if I could get her to agree.  Ah, she is now a 
student at ah, she's in her second year, at Middlesex Community College.  And ah, she's studying
Health Professions.  
B:  [unclear] 
T:  Ah, I'd like to go back to Nan Hul who is not related to Narong Hul, but who is studying to be
a doctor.  And ah, Samoth the lady who's being trained to be a para-professional in family 
planning.  And I said to her, "would there be a problem if Neah to you about some of these 
things?"  That sometimes men and women who are not related, you know, not husband and wife 
don't talk to each other.  And she said, "no, there wouldn't be a problem because I am a 
professional medically.  And he is a professional medically.  And you set culture aside when two 
professionals speak."  And I was very impressed.  I was very impressed.  Ah,
B:  I had read ah, something about the state of Washington on customs [unclear]
T:  Yeah, I think we have a copy here.  
B:  You have no citations, or no references, so I have no idea where the information came from.  
But if I, if there was a, [unclear] if I read through that, I could give you an idea [unclear] there's a
big difference en it comes to sexually related matters [unclear]
T:  Well, I think to from what I've found with ah, ah, talking with different board members, staff 
members, friends, ah, depends on what your station in life was before the war came.  If you were
a city dweller you basically did som, you know, you survived.  Ah, the war.  But you were 
accustomed to going to business, being a teacher, ah, a white collar worked.  That, you may look 
at some of these customs as yes, these are things, you know, we all hang our stockings by a 
chimney kind of thing.  But the real belief of something taking place um, very different from the 
people who say came from small villages in the mountains.  And I think it's the same kind of 
difference that you would find ah, seeing some farm people in the mountains in Tennessee, and 
seeing someone whose brought up in Manhattan.  It really is, you know.  Ah, and that's why I, I 
try to convince other Americans to see it that way.
B:  To see the differences
T:  That's right, our, our country you know, we have differences.  And ah a New Englander and a 
Texan.  We're all Americans but we have differences and we like to do things in a different way.  
And sometimes regionally you, you have to do it because you're accommodating yourself to the 
weather and the conditions of your region.  And it's the same thing for people from another 
country.  But too many Americans, you know,  if you're an Italian you're an Italian.  
B:  Easy way to deal with people.
T:  That's right.  That's right.  
B:  There must be a variety here with different backgrounds.  What about some of the arts and 
crafts and performance, are they represented?
T:  Well
B:  I know there was a study by the Refugee Arts Group.  They did have a survey.
T:  Well, I think that many of ah, our families ah, if they've gone off to the work place it's that's 
consuming their time.  And I was talking with ah, a gentlemen who had worked in the camps and
who had helped develop the voca, some of the vocational hands on training programs in the 
camps.  And we, I incorporated that curriculum into our ah, program here.  To give some basic 
hands on skills training.
B:  What do they do?  Woodworking or
T:  Well, anything, use a hammer, use a saw.  Ah, electro mechanically assembly.  Ah, the divider
in the office was built by students.  Learning to measure.  I mean they don't know about inches, 
they have the metric system.  So, you know, you're starting from ground zero.  And measure and 
cut, some plumbing, ah, in-taking inventory, things of that type.  That would be general to 
anything.  And even if you get a job that you don't know how to repair, you don't need to know 
how to repair a light socket, or to make your own extension cord.  Maybe those are some skills 
that will help you to be more self sufficient at home so you can spend the time doing other more 
productive things.  Um, but this gentlemen was, they were recommending that in the camps they 
don't do the traditional arts.  Because you're going to be earning five cents an hour if you're 
weaving baskets and things of that type.  Yeah, yeah, And I think if you're the way, you know,  I 
might knit in the evening, or I don't crochet I do some embroidery ah, to pass the time, or for 
enjoyment, right, ah
                               SIDE 2
B:  So anyway, I've been [few words unclear].  And we've documented some of their ceremonies.
I guess the most recent was Saturday and Sunday.  [Unclear] was reading stories about the 
thirteen lives of Buddha.  We documented a wedding.  I guess [name unclear].
T:  Oh, Sopeep's wedding, okay.
B:  What's his last name? 
D:  I thought it was [unclear].
T:  Khuth.
B:  It's K.  Okay.  Okay.
T:  Yeah, K-H-U-T-H.
B:  K-H-U-T-H.
T:  Right.  
B:  So in general I've talked to Larry Flynn of course.  And also a Narong, Hul (T:  Narong Hul) 
at the store.
T:  Yeah, good.
B:  He was an interesting man to talk to.
T:  Yeah.  Narong is, was one of the ah, original founders. 
B:  Yeah, and then I talked to Narin Sao.
T:  Yeah, another one.  Did you talk to Michael Ben Ho?
B:  Ah, no.  I forgot his name.  Ah, you think he's someone I should talk to?
T:  Yeah, very different personality and ah, um, his ah, he's like a mover.  (B:  comment unclear)  
All right.  He, he, he's exceedingly bright.  Um, very interested in seeing the community move 
forward.  Um, more of a chance taker in certain areas than some of the others.  Of course he'll, 
he'll take the chance by you know, asking someone else to take the step forward, but he has the 
vision.  
B:  How long have you been with the Cambodian end?
T:  Well, I started officially working in, I started officially working ah, February 1, 1985.  Um, 
and been here ever since.  Ah, the ah, I was interviewed for the job in November of '84.  And that
was like no other interview you'd ever want to have.  Ah, there were four young men and there 
were four elders.  And they all had, the young men pretty much asked the questions and then ah, 
translated what I said to the elders.  And it was kind of intimidating.  Um, and ah, Michael Ben 
Ho and Son Lee Sok and Narong Hul and Narin Sao were the four young men.  Um, and the 
elders, I've seen them, but you know, I don't remember their names.  Because we haven't had that
much contact with them.  And ah, I had not worked with refugees before.  Um, but I had um, 
worked with um, well I had worked with them indirectly um, through my job, ah, working for 
Senator Paul Tsongas, and doing the immigration work. And um, and I was in his office um, in 
75, in the Congressional Office when Vietnam fell, and the interaction.  And so, um, I had some 
background.  But not very much on Cambodia.  
B:  Did that, has the job altered your original ideas about what you [unclear] or what the people 
were like?  [Comment unclear]
T:  No.  I don't, I think it's um, I think it's um, expanded. You know, there's nothing that, that has 
changed, that what I envisioned um, um, things were like.  Things that they went through and so 
on, because I was very active in the Anti-Vietnam War Movement.  Um, so ah, but I've certainly 
learned a lot more about the culture.  Ah, I've, you know, simple things from when they say ah, 
when you ask someone to do something, and they say "yes."  That that doesn't necessarily mean 
yes.  It may mean I don't want to go against your wishes.  Ah, you have to ask more questions.  
I've found that because they tend to be private, they don't like you to ask questions, but there's no
outward resentment.  Um, so I've found that I always start by saying, "I know that you don't like 
me to ask a lot of questions, but in order to help you through the agencies in the United States, I 
need to do this."  And ah, they seem to relax.  Ah, very difficult to get the staff to follow suit on 
that.  Um, someone will come in with a problem of ah, "my daughter disappeared."  All right.  
And it seems to me that the, the, my Cambodian staff person will be talking to the client for 
twenty minutes.  Then he comes and he says, "his daughter disappeared."  And I say, "when?"  "I 
don't know."  You know.  "Was she with a friend?"  "I don't know."  "Where was she going?"  "I 
don't know."  "Well, what have you been asking this father?"  You know?  [Chuckles]  And so 
then we have to go through the whole thing.  And ah, it's not because my staff person is not 
competent, it's cultural.  
B:  Yeah, now that you've mentioned it, thinking back on interviews I've had, I've asked a lot of 
questions.  
T:  Yeah.  Well.
B:  I knew yesterday, [phone rings - few words unclear] the bride's brother didn't want to be tape 
recorded, because he didn't think his answers would be good enough.  That's interesting.
T:  Well when you mention tape recording, also there seems to be ah, difficulty with um, if 
someone is going to take certain action that may be positive, or there might be a negativism to it, 
um, they don't want to be responsible.  And so they have, the first time tape recorded my 
recommendations secretly, with a miniature tape recorder.  So that the person that I was talking 
to could take it back and if anything went wrong it wasn't his fault, it was my fault, I said so.  
And when I found out at the end of the conversation that I had been recorded.  I said, ah, "I don't 
ever want you to do that again.  If you want to record my statements, just say so.  I won't mind."  
Um, [laugh] yeah.
B:  [Few words unclear-phone rings]  That's ethical cannon #1 for our profession.  
T:  I don't know how to disengage this thing.
B:  It's okay.  [Unclear] record someone with knowledge in our field.
T:  Well, um, it was a very sensitive issue.  It had to do with um, the Temple.  And um, when the 
Temple was purchased ah, lack of information, thorough information was given to the 
community, and to the leader who was dealing with ah, the banks and so on.  And um, I, there 
was a confusion between whether or not there was, it, between code and between um, um, 
[pause] I can't think of the word right now.  Um, but the right to have a Temple in the, in the 
space.  Okay. 
B:  Oh, you mean with the city.
T:  With the city.
B:  And that's Chelmsford right? 
T:  Right.  
T:  And they were assured that(--)
D:  With the zoning board?
T:  Zoning, that's it.  That, [someone is moving mike around] that as far zoning is concerned, yes 
they could have it.  But, no one mentioned code.  And so, (B:  the building codes) so the building
was purchased and a great big festival was going to take place, you know, here's the first time we
gather in our meeting hall.  And there were so many people that came from New York, from 
Providence, from Boston everywhere, that the streets couldn't hold the parked cars.  So they were
parking in peoples driveways and in various places, wherever they could squeeze a car, which 
was, which created a, a turmoil.  And the neighborhood was very upset.  And I believe that the 
police were called.  And that's when they found out they didn't have an occupancy permit, and 
the building was not up to code for the use.  So what happened immediately was you know, they 
looked at the leader who had been instrumental in purchasing the building that he didn't do his 
job right.  And I tried to explain that, you know, we had an American bank here that knew the 
purpose.  And we had an attorney that represented them who knew the purpose.  And they're the 
ones who failed.  So, what we did was we got a new attorney [keeps coughing]  I think I need to 
get something to drink.  [Long pause on tape]  So um, so when the building was, was purchased, 
um, code hadn't been mentioned.  And now this was an issue.  And they couldn't use it for what 
they wanted.  Ah, we found a new attorney.  We, my recommendation was um, let's find an 
attorney who's willing to do this at, you know, at a reduced rate especially, and who is, who 
represents a city.  Who is the attorney for a town, or a city, because they would be familiar with 
the codes.  And ah, let's, let's um, go from there.  So I called a number of friends and 
acquaintances and ended up with three or four names.  And then checked these names out with 
other people.  I said, if you were choosing an attorney and these are the four names, which one 
would you choose for this kind of thing?  And from totally different sources the same name kept 
up as number one.  So we approached that attorney.  And he decided that he would do that.  And 
then he led us to an architect.  And the architect then led us to a builder.  And ah, that team could 
argue.  I mean we could get past, if a question was it had to be done because that was the law, we
knew that our team knew that.  If it, if the question was, because of prejudice, no we want you to 
do this in addition, our team could argue this has never been required of a religious institution in 
the past.  And so we really did have a good, a good group.  But it was convincing the community 
to shell out another $25,000.  You know, and you had to go all the way to the point of saying 
well, you can sit on your hands and pay the mortgage and not use the building.  You can loose 
the building.  You can sell the building, or you can come up with the money and have what you 
want.  And, so that's what was being recorded, my recommendation that they should do this.  So 
from then on when I met with what I, for want of a better word, "The Temple Committee", the 
group of elders who were very concerned.  I would immediately say, if you want to record what 
I'm saying.  Please put the recorded right there.  [laughs]  So from then on it was very open.  
They finally stopped using it, as the building progressed and they could move in, you know.  
B:  How was the surrounding community reaction then over the (--) 
T:  Well, one of the things that the ah, I suggested to the board and they talked it out.  And they 
did have a neighborhood celebration.  And it was not for necessarily the whole Cambodian 
Community to come to, but, there were many Cambodians there.  And they invited people in the 
neighborhood, um, some of the religious leaders from churches that were close by, and many 
people came.  And many people made speeches, and said we welcome you.  And that was very 
good.  Um, I, I you know, when something different moves into a neighborhood, there are always
questions.  And this was a great idea, because they could, they could see now what it was all 
about.  And, and if you know that something's different, but you know how it's different, you're 
not as frightened of it, and you don't complain as much.  
B:  Are there people in the community, Cambodian Community moving out toward the Temple 
[unclear]?
T:  Well, um, Mr. Michael Ben Ho bought some property on the same street and had a brand new 
house built.
B:  What, on up the road?  Up the [unclear]?
T:  Right on the same street.  I have been on the street, but I haven't seen the house.  But right on 
Quigley Ave.
D:  Well, that brings up an important question and that's neighborhoodness.  Ah, in terms of the 
Cambodian Community.  So where have they settled?  I know there's (--)
T:  There are, there are maybe three large pockets in Lowell.  They're not all in the same place 
and we know this by, by doing a mailing and sorting by Zip Codes.  Okay.  And the largest group
is in the 01852 zip area, which is in the Acre.  
B:  01852. 
T:  All right.  And I'm not a native of Lowell so I don't know the, the terminology for the 
different sections.  But ah, one of the other Zip Code Areas is across the Merrimack River.  Um, 
off Bridge Street.
B:  It would either be Belvidere or Paw, I mean Centralville or Pawtucketville.
T:  Yeah, it would either be there.  But, I don't know what it's called.  
B:  Yeah, if it's West of, it's Centralville, or it's Pawtucketville if it's right. 
D:  Well I, here's a little map.
B:  Not that I know anything, but I have this map.  
T:  Okay.  Okay.  It would ah, it would be in this area.  In the Pawtucketville Area.
B:  What's the zip there?  And since you know the zips I can [unclear].
T:  I don't know.
B:  Okay.
T:  52, I know.  The others I don't know.  And then in the Lower Highlands there's another group.
B:  Okay.
T:  In the Lower Highlands.  
B:  I just noticed from looking where markets are, Asian Markets and so on (T:  Yeah, that there 
must be enough people around there to make it worthwhile to have a market in the 
neighborhood. 
T:  Right.  Well, I was going to Narin Sao's house one day and ah, his wife was going to show me
how to make the coconut jello with the seaweed, and the coconut milk, and so on.  And I was 
short some of the supplies.  So in the Lower Highlands area I suddenly saw a market that had 
symbols that I knew was Southeast Asian.  And um, it turned out it was a Laotian Market.  And I 
had no idea it was there.  But um, uh, they certainly seemed prosperous.  Um (--)
B:  Ah, there must, I forget, I talked to Joe Antonuccio.
T:  Right.
B:  At ah, you know, that big Southeast Asian Market [unclear].
T:  Right.  
B:  I think it's probably the first eating area.
T:  Well!
B:  It was around '82, early.   I don't know if it's first or not.
T:  Um, I'm not sure that Joe was there in '82, because there was a write up on him in '85.  No, 
unless he was there for three years.  The Phnom Penh Store, which is sort of across Cardinal 
O'Connell (B:  Yeah, [unclear), all right, was um, much much smaller.  And I think he opened up 
either at the same time, or just before Joe.  But then Joe had the big market.  And Phnom Penh 
was the little tiny you know, (B:  Right) mom and pop kind of one room crowded um, but the 
community is large enough to support both stores, because Phnom Penh has expanded.  And then
Battam Bang opened up on Merrimack Street.  And now we've got several more.  Um, we've 
tried ah, to tell the community that it takes so many people to support a certain kind of store.  We
got a lot of information from the Small Business Administration.  But I think that if you had a 
store in Connecticut, or New York, and you see that the stores here are doing well, you're going 
to open up.  And eventually some of them will close, unless the population continues.  Um, ah, 
we've also sort of encouraged them to ah, if you really want to have a market, don't open right 
next door to where it's already saturated.  Ah, go to another section.  Um, have it international.  
Appeal to the college students.  Get a new clientele.  You may get some of your (--)
B:  Is that, is that hard, or easy for the people, the business people?
T:  Well no one's done it yet.  And we we're talking about it the summer of '85.  so.
B:  I remember talking to Narong a couple of times about his store.  He said in the beginning it 
was mostly non-Asian.  And then it just flipped around, so that now most of his clientele, [few 
words unclear] clientele are Asians.
T:  Are Asians.
B:  And he prefers it that way.  Because he feels he's fulfilling a need for them.
T:  Right.
B:  [Unclear] when he sees a need, he has a new element.  
T:  New element.  Ah, one of the (--)  It's interesting, because there's a young girl, I first met her, 
she was a senior at the Greater Lowell Vocational School.  And she asked the ah, the M.A.A. to 
sponsor a Senior Prom.  Um, the M.A.A had done this um, the Summer of, well the Spring 
actually of '86, ah because no parent would allow their high school seniors to go to the 
graduating proms, the dances, you know.  Again the cultural things.  Young men, young women 
can't do that.  Ah, and we sponsored one.  And we had more adults than we had teenagers.  And 
the Girls Club in Lowell allowed us to use their space.  Their beautiful new gym, and then the 
kitchen, and everything downstairs for the food.  And I think the parents realized that this was 
okay.  And there were, you know, M.A.A. staff there.  Larry Flynn and his wife helped out.  Ah, 
so that the Spring of '87 when Kim Son Kao ah, asked us to do it again, I had one helper!  We 
only had teenagers.  We had the group of teenagers who, the committee who did an awful lot of 
the work, and what not, but only one other adult.  And these, and the kids were allowed, Narong 
Hul's sister I believe was allowed to go to her prom.  Ah, so, so it changed.  And I think partly 
we, using the word prom it was something more special than a dance.  
B:  Is there, is there a lot of intergenerational conflict within the Cambodian Community?  
T:  Well, I think you know, in any community where you have the young people are becoming 
part of the, the culture here.  And you know, if your friends are doing it, any teenager, my own 
teenager you know, "well all my friends are doing it, why can't I?"  All right.  And ah, so I think 
some of that is happening and they, and they, the kids want to be accepted.  Um, and the parents 
can see that they're losing them.  You know, um (--)
B:  You mean in terms of the culture?
T:  Of the culture.  And there are some young people um, who realize that.  And they say to the 
parents you know, yes we will, you know, they behave.  They don't just say it.  They behave in a 
manner that the parents ah, are accustomed to between generations.  And those parents are 
allowing more freedom.  You know some do. It's individual.  Just like any other family kind of 
thing.  But I wanted to go back to Kim Son and Narong saying he is happy that now his, he's 
serving his community.  Kim Son entered ah, Middlesex Community College in September.  (B:  
This is?  Oh)  This is, no no, this is the young girl that asked us to do the prom this year.  And 
what she had studied at the ah, at the Vocational School was printing.  And her father was very 
pleased with her and said, "you know, you're going to go learn something about business.  And 
then we'll set up our own printing shop."  And with the number of weddings we have a printing 
shop would do well.  Ah, all kinds of bulletins, notices, ah, other non-profits who have a service 
that they want distributed.  You know, if she bought the Cambodian type she'd have a lot of 
business.  Um, that's when she started college.  Now, she came in two weeks ago.  One semester 
is over.  And she's taken a part time job as a parent-aide at the Y.W.C.A.,  working with members 
of the Cambodian Community who need that kind of a service.  She's just I think ten hours a 
week.  So it doesn't interfere with her school work.  And she said, "I'm changing."  And I said, 
"oh, why are you changing?"  And she said, "if I go into business I help myself.  If I change to 
the health professions I help my people."  So even kids are getting this sense.  So I said, "you 
mean you don't want to go into printing any more?"  And she said, "I like printing, but it's kind of
selfish."  You know that's a nice thing to hear.  Really nice.  Not that all the kids are like that, but 
some of that is transferring down to the next generation.  
B:  What about things like language with the [unclear] thing, [unclear] are being born here.  Are 
they bi, are they truly bilingual?  Are they?
T:  It depends on the families again.  It really does.  Ah, I know families and some of them are 
students in the English as a Second Language classes, who religiously watch Sesame Street with 
their children.  They want their kids to enter a mainstream classroom in kindergarten.  And there 
are others who don't do that at all.  Again, some of our students.  And I was speaking to The 
Rotary Club a couple of months ago.  And the question came up.  You know, you say you have 
students learning English.  Do they practice at home?  And I said, "No.  Most of them don't.  And
I think it's not because they don't want to learn English.  Ah, both my parents came from another 
country and I was born here.  And we were forbidden to speak English in the home, because they
wanted us to maintain our French.  It's not because they were anti-English.  They were 
pro-keeping the native language.  Um, when I was about thirteen my father was going to go for 
his citizenship.  Then we had to speak English because he needed to practice.  [Chuckles]  And I 
think, you know, when you think about it I think that most people from another culture, another 
country ah, go through that process.  It's not that they don't want to become assimilated.  I think 
they want to very much, but they want their children to have some of the culture.  And I must say
that among ah, my mother's brothers and sisters who all were, all came, the whole family came 
to this country when ah, my mom was nine.  Ah, I'm the only child of like thirty odd cousins who
can still read and write in French.  
M:  Now do you think the older Cambodians are afraid that will happen?  Or do they believe 
they'll be able to keep the language and some of the, what they think are important customs 
alive?  
B:  Well, I've seen quite a few young people who are not, you know, the kindergarteners, um, but 
the older teenagers and young twenties.  And I was very much surprised because the country, you
know, there hasn't been a school for a long time for these kids.  These, these young people were 
ten years old when the war came basically.  Ah, that they can read and write in their native 
language.  So parents are doing something.  Ah, many of the, the, maybe, I guess the bulk of ah, 
the Cambodians here, um, were not very highly educated in the home country, because the 
Khmer Rouge saw to that.  So we have ah, some who read and write, but we also have some who
can't read and write.  They lived in the villages.  And those individuals can't teach their children, 
because they can't read and write themselves.
B:  Is there any, are there any formal (--)
T:  Well, I understand
B:  [unclear] organizations and institutions?
T:  Well at one time the M.A.A. ran Saturday morning classes for young people.  And they 
ranged in age from five to sixteen.  Um, one of the teachers who was a teacher in Cambodia, ah, 
felt after a year that parental interest wasn't there, and that's why the children started dropping 
out.  And I think, you know, some of it is, [pause] there are other things to be done on a Saturday 
morning especially if you are a working family.  That's when you go shopping, you know, go to 
the laundromat and things of that type.  Ah, I, I really believe that come the future some of these 
youngsters who are born here, once they're at the college level they will want to learn if they 
don't know now.
B:  Yeah, well that's, wait another generation.
T:  That's right.  
B:  Their children.  And by then it's often maybe not too late, but getting very late (T:  right) to 
go back and find.
T:  Well I found it very interesting when my own children ah, and my oldest one is the only one 
that I gave French lessons to when he was young.  But it's kind of difficult because my husband's
knowledge of French was limited.  And my in-laws, no one spoke it.  Um, but at least he had a 
little bit when he was you know, five, six, seven years old.  When he entered high school, well he
started languages in junior high, ah, he chose French out of the languages available.  And I 
thought that seemed fairly normal.  Ah, ten years later my daughter enters junior high and I'm 
trying to convince her that Spanish is going to be far more valuable.  And, but she chose French. 
She eventually did take both languages.  And ah, has continued with the Spanish in college, and 
is involved in Hispanic affairs in her job.  Um, but young, youngest son who's a senior in high 
school didn't want to take any other language and I don't know why.  [Chuckles]
B:  You have no idea.  
T:  Nope, just French.  And he, (B:  just French) yeah, just French.  Ah, and he ended up ah, 
when he had had well, he was a freshmen, finished his freshmen year in high school.  He went on
exchange program and lived with a French family for a month.  And then his French really 
increased.  And the following summer one of the boys from the family ah, came and spent the 
month with us, so ah.  
B:  I want to ask you about medicine too, and health.  
T:  Okay.
B:  This things just about(--)  These go fast.  They're half hour tapes.  [Unclear]
SIDE I ENDS
SIDE II BEGINS
B:  I wanted, I wanted to ask about the health [few words unclear].  I'm particularly interested in 
traditional beliefs and practices.  No just home treatment, but treatment by various specialists and
[few words unclear]  And how that interfaces with uh, what's been established medical practices.
T:  Well here at the, at the M.A.A. we don't see too much of that, but I can tell you some of the 
(--)  Well just this morning one staff person who came in late, and he had called, was to take his 
grandmother to the Monk.  And just before I came in he had arrived.  And apparently she was 
having great difficulty breathing.  An um, but she has now been admitted to the hospital.  And 
um, you know, the comment was made, "well the Monk didn't help."  And you know, my feeling 
is if the Monk makes her feel at ease to enter the Western Hospital he has helped.  I know in 
some mental health cases uh, the Solomon Mental Health Center, and Venerable Sao Kon have 
worked together on cases.  Uh, there seems to be no conflict.  You know, there might be some 
issues where there might be a conflict, but those that I am aware of, uh, there was no conflict.  
There was a joining together.  Uh, we do see some of our students come in, and other clients 
come in, uh, where there's evidence that you know, "cupping" had taken place, (B: "coining") or 
"coining".  Right.  And uh, we have a day care center.  It has all-american children, and Hispanic 
children, and Cambodian children.  Uh, and we have a Cambodian aid who is a mother, two kids.
And uh, one little boy got sick and she pulled out the "Tiger Balm", and this was going to take 
care of him.  Uh, the, then we have a high schooler who comes in after school to sweep the 
floors, and wash the floors.  And he came in and suddenly felt very very sick.  And out came the 
"Tiger Balm" again before anybody could do anything.  But you know, the child had some kind 
of, either he ate something that brought this suddenly on, or because he was vomiting and so on.  
Uh (--)
B:  Tiger Balm.  What did he, did he rub it on himself, or?
T:  On his abdomen, because he was feeling sick, yeah.  Yeah.  Now I had you know, if you want 
to use it I don't care, you know?  But just mid-November I, my husband and I went on vacation 
to visit my older son and his wife in Oakland, California.  Uh, and I had been bothered with a 
stiff neck and a soreness, and I still have it.  And my daughter-in-law whips out the Tiger Balm.  
[Laughs]  I was so.  I said, "wait till I get back and tell my staff!"  You know.  But I used it.  And 
it seems to anesthesize the surface a little bit for a short time.  And it didn't cure anything, but it 
relieved the pain so that I could enjoy myself, you know, or mostly so that I could sleep at night. 
Uh, but uh, so now I have my own little package of Tiger Balm in my purse.  I would imagine it 
would be great, because it's like (--)
B:  [Few words unclear] in the stores here?
T:  Yeah, yeah.  
B:  Now some of the things from Chinese medicine you have to go to Boston.
T:  Yeah, and I think some of the Vietnamese doctors that we have have medications that they 
prepare.  But I've never really (--)
B:  You mean medical doctors?  
T:  Medical doctors, yeah. 
B:  Yeah, who also use (--)
T:  Use some.  Yeah.  I think the, the original (--)
B:  Who else?  Who are some of the doctors that (--)
T:  Well Doctor Nyguen was the first one who was here.  (B:  Umhm)  And I think he has some 
preparations that he puts together.  Um, Dr. Tran, uh(--)
B:  And where is he?  Is he down (--)
T:  He's on Dummer Street.  Again, not far from Joe's.  Right.   Right next to uh, (B:  he's on the 
other side) the DeMoulas Store.  Right.  Right.  Um, now he used to be on Merrimack Street, but 
he moved into the quarters.  I think they were larger.  And again, very close, one block over is 
where Dr. Tran has his office.  And as a matter of fact you can cut through the DeMoulas parking
lot through this little alley way and you're on Worthen Street.  And that's where Dr. Tran is.  Now
the new, when Dr. Tran first came to Lowell to take a look, I think he came from Hartford.  At 
least he came from Connecticut.  And he said my patients are all moving to Lowell, so I've come 
to take a look.  And he followed his patients.  Um, and uh, he came to the MAA and said, I know 
that's it's a large Cambodian Community, I'd like you to help me to recruit an office worker, 
nurse who speaks the language, so that I can communicate more affectively with the patients, 
which showed he was a very wise businessman, as well as being a Doctor.  And uh, when Dr. 
Doe came he also came to the office.  And now we have a Vietnamese dentist, graduated from 
Tufts.  And so her credentials are American.  Um, we've been hoping and we're willing to do 
what we can with the hospitals.  We've talked to the hospitals, uh, to try to allow the Vietnamese 
doctors to have access to the services.  Uh, I think, you know when you think of a patient/doctor 
relationship, and why the patient goes to the Vietnamese doctor in the first place, they feel more 
comfortable, it's a piece of home.  But if the illness is serious enough that the patient must be 
hospitalized, they have to be turned over to a stranger.  And I, I don't think that's right.  
B:  They don't understand the customs of just touching people.  
T:  That's right.
B:  In the wrong spot.  (T:  Yeah)  Something a Western doctor takes for granted as normal 
proceedure might really put off (--)
T:  Well even if you put the cultural issues aside, I mean I know that I would feel pretty awful if a
doctor were taking care of me and knew my history, and so on, and suddenly it's very serious.  
You have to go to the hospital, and it's a stranger.  Someone I've never seen or met.  So you have 
that trauma piled up that any one would feel.  And on top of that the cultural things.  We have 
had many calls from the hospital describing, asking us to describe the, a proceedure that's going 
to take, because the hospitals have been dragging their heels hiring staff.  They insist that the 
same qualifications have to be there.  They make no allowances that language is important.  And 
so uh, it, it really makes it very difficult for the patients.  Uh, we had two young women that 
came in I believe the summer of '86.  One had been a midwife in Cambodia.  Her English was 
quite limited.  Uh, another one had worked in a nursing home in Seattle, Washington.  And they 
came east together.  And the one who had worked in the nursing home, sure she, everyone has 
limited English, but she could communicate quite well in English.  And we thought, oh boy, 
we've got to qualify when she had a certificate from a place in Washington State.  And uh, the 
hospital would just be grabbing her out.  No, we had to go through this long big proceedure, and 
they weren't interested.  
B:  Well the hospitals have traditionally not [few words unclear] no matter what culture anyway, 
(T:  yeah) certified or not. 
T:  But the other one was a certified nurse's aid in the United States, and still they, they wouldn't 
make allowances.  
B:  Is there, is there much home birth in the community?
T:  Not that I'm aware of.
B:  [Unclear]
T:  There's a prenatal clinic at Lowell General Hospital.  The hospital, that's the furthest away.  
So it makes it very difficult.  For a long time Lowell General did not have an interpreter in the 
prenatal clinic.  I mean they've just hired somebody not too long ago.  And uh, the International 
Institute in Lowell has uh, an interpreter, but it's a man.  And here this man is taking these 
women and having to interpret things.  Now does he give an accurate picture?  One, because he 
doesn't want to say certain words and things.  And two, can he give an accurate picture, because 
it's his client, the patient describing it to him.  Um, my cultureal teacher here, and I went to 
Middlesex Community College to talk to the teachers in the Health Professions Unit, to try to 
give them some culture.  And when it came to birth, and family planning, and that sort of thing, 
my, my staff person refused to talk about certain things.  There are certain words he just wouldn't
use.  And so as he, you know, I said to him, "okay.  I will do some of this talking, and if I make a 
mistake just, you know, just nod your head no.  And you know, his face was red, his head was 
downcast, and it was okay if I was saying this thing.  But he couldn't say it.  But he couldn't say 
it.  (B:  Yeah)  So.  Now there are others where there's no problem.  Uh, one of our recent 
graduates from our, our ESO classes, we have set up in a part-time job with the agency across the
hall, which is Health Works.  And they have a family planning.  And they have been wanting to 
hire a Cambodian Lady, because they know that they need to service the community.  And uh, 
Sarong was [gain?].  She had been a nurse in Cambodia.  She had given IV's.  Of course we, she 
never talked about Family Planning.  So she's having a learning experience.  And the Director 
said they want to train her so they can get her Certified Para Professional, which pleases me very
much, but the Line Supervisor, the Nurse Practitioner and the other technicians that she's 
working with have never worked or talked to a Cambodian before.  And so she drops in after 
work every day.  And she was saying, you know, "I have trouble understanding them.  They have
trouble understanding me."  And um, and we said, "hang in there."  [coughs]  Then the Nurse 
Practitioner and the uh, Supervisor came in, the Medical Technician came in.  And they said, "we
don't know if she doesn't understand English.  Can't she come back to school here?"  We said 
"no, she's reached her maximum with us."  Uh, the next step would be pre GED preparation, and 
getting her GED.  So they said, "well we have to do something."  So we don't even know if she 
understand the concept of Family Planning.  And of course we have to be careful, malpractice 
and so on.  And I can see their point.  So I said, "look.  We have some materials on different 
methods for family planning written in the native language.  Now why don't we give these to 
you, you can give them to her.  Tell her how, and ask her to tell you back in English what she's 
reading as a learning experience."  We she happened to see her bosses talking to me.  That 
afternoon she called up.  And it's always more difficult to communicate over the telephone, 
because you don't have body language at hand.  But Sarong called and said, "what were they 
talking about?"  I mean she's a smart lady.  So I said, uh, went through the thing and I said, 
"Sarong, it's not your problem, it's an American problem.  Their ear has to get accustomed to 
your voice, the same way that a parent learns to know what a two year old is saying, that the 
neighbor down the street can't understand.  But the parent knows.  I know what people are 
saying.  Their ear has to learn so that they will know.  And you know, if they're talking to fast, 
ask them to be more slow, speak more slowly."  And we pretty much counseled the, her Line 
Supervisor that way too.  Um, now there is a gentleman who was studying to be a doctor in 
Cambodia when the war came.  And he is an outreach worker for Public Health, but he continues
to read medical books.  He's a terrific guy.  So I, I told both Sarong and her supervisors that if 
there was a question of her ability to know the medical content, he would speak with her.  And he
wouldn't tell them she's incapable of learning, or she certainly knows what she's talking about, 
but she can't verbalize it back to you, but he certainly would tell me because we've known each 
other for a long time.  And after she and I had this long conversation on the phone, I thought, 
there's nothing wrong with this lady's comprehension.  We're not even in person.  We're doing it 
on the phone and she understood every single nuance that was being put over.  And uh, they 
really don't have anything to worry about.  If they only would be patient.  
B:  So it sounds like there's some effort made on health medical establishment to train [unclear].  
T:  Well very small.
B:  So what about the other, what about the other side of the establishment attempting to find out 
about Cambodian customs so that they can understand better how to treat them?
T:  Well Merrimack Valley Area Health Association has, had been asking and now the same 
young man who uh, Nan Ho who was studying to be a doctor is on their board.  And he can give 
feedback from the community to the Merrimack Valley Health Association.  Um, we need um, 
Sally [Pinrebe?] is on the Department of Mental Health at the state level.  And she is Cambodian 
married to an American.  And she has been doing a lot of work trying to break through and get, 
especially for our area here, a special mental health unit.  Southeast Asian mental health unit.  
And you know, the, from the time that the planning money came, it's going to be three years, but 
we hope that's going to be a reality that it will eventually be funded.  I think when you have 
something like that you'll have more of an interchange.  Um, public health tries to hold cultural 
sessions for american service providers.  And they tap into, they have a network.  Sally is one of 
the people who frequently is the speaker.  People from Brighton Marine Hospital come and speak
on their Southeast asian unit and bring some of the culture.  Um, the Department of Social 
Services last year had a, well it was only an afternoon workshop for local agencies.  The Girls 
Club, the Boys Club, the Y, the Library, the Office of Employment and Training, they were all 
invited to come.  And they had a group of panelist.  And someone started with the history of 
Cambodia, going back to before, [few words unclear].  And then someone else talked about you 
know, the, the problems of the new arrival.  And then the problem someone else talked about, uh,
the problems that come up after the refugees have been here awhile.  They have learned to 
survive.  They now have food, they have housing and they have heat.  Um, now they're thinking 
back, some of the mental health problems that are surfacing, you know, my relative that's still 
back there.  Uh, I'm sure some of it is similar to um, the, what is called the survivor's guilt in 
hotel fires, things of that type.  Uh, and some of it is my children are becoming americans, 
americanized and I'm not.  What's going to happen to our family unit? 
B:  The children are, is the group that I haven't talked to.  I tried to corner four kids in the 
basement of the temple.
T:  How old?
B:  Teenagers, and they were hm, you know, in some kind of way they were poking fun of what 
was going on upstairs [unclear].  (T:  yeah)  They were going [makes sounds], like trying to be 
cool and stuff.  So I want to go sit down and talk to them.  They didn't, you know, they were very
reluctant to do that.  But I think it's, it could be a balance.  I really should talk to [unclear].  
T:  Yes.  And I think [clears throat] (--)
B:  Do you have any suggestions about where [unclear]?
T:  Well I was going to suggest that you might want to talk to Heng Bunchia.  Heng is the (--)
B:  Is he at the temple?
T:  He's at the temple, yeah.  
B:  He's the president, or treasurer, or something?
T:  Treasurer, right.  
B:  Um, now the way I understand Heng's story, is that when his family came to the United 
States, he was left behind with the Monks to complete some studies.  And I don't know if it was 
one of the sacred time periods that you can't leave the temple until so many days, or so many 
weeks.  Uh, because I don't think he stayed behing too long.  And he's uh, he's uh, he was uh, one
of our bilingual aids in the past, and uh, vocational E.S.L. teacher.  Um, but he finally, he and his 
wife worked and he had the two jobs.  Uh, they bought a house.  And then her parents came in 
and then other members of the extended family.  And I think everyone, you know, I don't know 
this for a fact, but I think everyone chipping in to pay the rent, he could give up working two 
jobs, and he could enjoy his children, you know.  Um, and I was, we were sorry to lose him as a 
staff person, but I was happy that he was going to have more time with his kids.  Uh, Heng 
dragged his heels about enrolling his daughter in kindergarten, because he wanted to push back 
that tide of she was going to become like american kids.  Okay.  Um, we finally told him, you 
know, now that the child is a certain age, it's against the law to keep her home.  You have to send 
her to school.  And if you postpone this you're only going to be hurting her, because you're just 
pushing back time.  You're not resolving.  You're going to resolve the questions when she goes to 
school and she comes home, and how the family deals with that.  That, so don't delay.  Do it now.
And um, I think that he would be able tell, he would be able to tell you something about the 
young people.  And I think he could direct you to some young teenagers who probably are, are 
not rebelling, but are evolving their american culture combined with the ancestoral customs.  
B:  Yeah, that whole process is very interesting.  
T:  Yeah.  And I, I think you will find that there are different teenagers.  There are the rebellious 
kind who, all teenagers are, right?  They're cutting the apron strings.  And they're doing it, I'm 
going to be cool, and I'm going to wear these clothes, and so on, which upsets their families 
tremendously.  And there are those that are doing it not so dramatically, but are evolving in 
blending it.  And, and I think you really should talk to both groups.  
B:  [Comment unclear]
T:  And I could ask um, uh, this poor girl.  I always, I always go to her, because her family to me 
is, is a very special family.  And there are a number of children down to, I think the youngest one
is second, or third grade.  And uh, the oldest daughter is married, and the oldest son is married.  
And then comes this girl.  Yeah, we have the whole range.  Yeah.  And as a matter of fact it's 
even broader range, because her father was married before.  And I don't know if he became 
widowed back, well he must have, back in Cambodia.  But she has half brothers who are like 
forty years old.  And uh, her father I think understands a little bit of English. He's legally blind.  
Um, he looks like you know, a little old man, and yet there's a tremendous amount of wisdom in 
that person.  Tremendous.  And there are times when, if I have a questions about you know, we 
were thinking about having a family planning class here.  The question came up, do we teach the 
men separate from the women.  Do we put them both in the same room as long as they're, they're
husband and wife.  Uh, you could talk to a husband and wife together maybeon this, but how is 
the husband going to feel about the other lady who is sitting over there, you know?  We ended up
we never had the class.  Um, uh, but I, I told this girl.  I said, "Robin, would you do me a favor 
and ask your father culturally how should we deal with this?"  And the answer came back, you 
can't put the men and women in the same room if you're in Cambodia, but maybe in America it 
should be tried.  And this guy is like seventy years old.  
B:  [Comment unclear]
T:  Yeah, super.  But I think, you know, if I could get her to agree.  Um, she is now a student at 
uh, she's in her second year at Middlesex Community College.  And uh, she's studying Health 
Professions.  
B:  Well I would appreciate it.
T:  Um, I'd like to go back Nan Ho who is not related to Narong Ho, but who was studying to be 
a doctor.  And uh, and Sarong, the lady who is being trained to be a paraprofessional in Family 
Planning. And I said to her, would there be a problem if Nan talks to you about some of these 
things that sometimes men and women who are not related, you know, not husband and wife 
don't talk to each other about.  And she said, no, there wouldn't be a problem, because I am a 
professional medically, and he is a professional medically.  And you set culture aside when two 
professionals speak.  And I was very impressed.  I was very impressed.  Um. 
B:  I had read something about from the State of Washington on the customs [rest of comment 
unclear].
T:  Yeah, I think we have a copy here.  
B:  It had no, you know, no citations and no references, so I have no idea where the information 
came from.  But it was, by reading through that I can get an idea that there's a big, big difference 
when it comes to sexual relating matters, and [few words unclear].  
T:  Well I think too, from what I found with um, um, talking with different Board members, staff 
members, friends, uh, depends on what your station in life was before the war came.  If you were
a city dweller, and basically did some, you know, you survived the war, but you were 
accustomed to going to business, being a teacher, um, a white collar worker, that you may look at
some of these customs as yes, these are things, you know, we all hang our stockings by a 
chimney kind of thing.  But the real belief of something taking place um, very different from the 
people who say came from small villages in the mountains.  And I think it's the same kind of 
difference that you would find um, seeing some farm people in the mountains in Tennessee, and 
seeing someone who's been brought up in Manhattan.  It really is, you know?  Um, and that's 
why I, I, I try to convince other americans to see it that way.  
B:  To see [few words unclear]  (T:  That's right.  Our country)  It's always [unclear] to see 
[unclear] culture.  
T:  Our country, you know, we have differences.  And uh, a New Englander, and a Texan.  We're 
all americans, but we have differences and we like to do things in a different way.  And 
sometimes you know, regionally you, you have to do it because you're accomodating yourself to 
the weather and the conditions of your region.  And it's the same thing for people from another 
country.  But too many americans, you know, if you're an Italian, you're an Italian.  If you're 
[coughs, cannot transcribe]
B:  Easy way of doing things.  
T:  That's right, that's right.  
B:  Well there must be a variety here [unclear].  What about some of the arts and crafts, 
performance [unclear]?  Are they represented?
T:  Well!
B:  I know there was a study by the Refugee Arts Group.  They did kind of a survey here. 
T:  Well I think that many of our families um, if they've gone off to the work place it's, that's 
consuming their time.  And I was talking with a gentleman who had worked in the camps, and 
who had helped develop the, some of the vocational hands-on training programs in the camps.  
And we incorporated that curriculum into our program here to give some basic hands-on skills 
training.
B:  What were they doing?  Woodworking, or?
T:  Well anything.  Use a hammer, use a saw.  Uh, (--)
B:  [Comment unclear]]
  
T:  Uh, electrical mechanical assembly.  Uh, the divider in the office was built by students.  
Learn to measure.  I mean they don't know about inches.  They have the Metric system.  So you 
know, you're starting from ground zero.  And measure and cut.  Some plumbing.  Um, taking 
inventory.  Things of that type that, that would be general to anything.  And even if you get a job 
that you know how to repair, you don't need to know how to repair a light socket, or to make 
your own extension cor

   TAPE COMES TO END
T:  I said, "don't tell me about borrowing."  I said, "I don't want the tissue back when you're 
through with it.  You are taking it."  And they said, "no, no, when we take things in America we 
call it borrowing."  [laugh] 
B:  That covers a lot of ground.  
T:  Yeah, yeah.
B:  What are some of the
T:  Well, when ah,
B:  Things that are being practiced.  And I mean every, you know, the art.  I'm, I'm being 
inclusive when I say arts.  I'm not taking, I'm including food,
T:  Well, food is wonderful.  [laugh]
B:  Well, I've noticed some Burger King's being brought to [unclear] too.  [laugh]  A lot of 
[unclear]
T:  Right, right and ah, ah, we had, we've had some staffers who you know, every once in a while
we'd chip in and let's get a pizza.  And everyone has a piece and ah, many Cambodians once they
get a slice of pizza, their hooked.  [laugh]  You know, and this one guy, he loved to show each 
[unclear] to get a pizza today.  But, he keeps saying, "I think my wife would like pizza."  But he 
never would go to a Pizza Parlor and order a pizza and take it home.  You know, I don't know 
why.  His English was certainly good enough.  But, I don't know what kept him from doing it.  
But he never did.  He'd say, "well maybe you know, maybe at, someday actually go get a pizza 
for my wife to taste."  
B:  Maybe she'd like it too much or something.  
T:  [laugh]  I don't know.  I don't really think that was it.  I think he just felt strange.  This was, 
this was something very foreign.  It's not like going into the market and taking a can of food off 
the shelf.  You have to ask somebody for something and then they have to cook it for you.  
B:  Is there much experimentation with food and things?  About going to the market and seeing 
things that are strange.  Taking them home and trying out.
T:  I don't know.  I don't know, um, my guess would be that most of the cooking is traditional. 
You know, and there are enough markets where they can get the traditional food.  
B:  So other Cambodian ah, encounter with American food like fast foods
T:  Well, that would be different.  
B:  Rather than going home and making something.  
T:  And cooking a hamburger.  And putting it in a roll and put ketchup on it.  I don't think they 
would do that.  
B:  Right.  
T:  But it's O.K
B:  But, they will go to MacDonalds or Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken.  
T:  That's right.  Um, I, now I know that like Larry Flynn's wife told me one day when she had 
some of these, these um, either older teenagers or early twenties, including the guy who got the 
permanent, all right because that was one of their "boys" in quotes.  Um, that Kathy would make 
a great big pot of spaghetti sauce.  And cook some spaghetti up.  And they loved it.  But no one 
would like take it back home.  Ah, the only time I've been asked for, "how do you make that?"  
was when I brought in ah, ah some ch, some chew, well we call it Choochoo Train Fried Rice.  
It's ah, in Joyce Chens cookbook.  And it's called that.  Um, and it was a different kind of fried 
rice.  Oh, I want my wife to make some like this.  But see that's not too different.  
B:  It's a little closer.  
T:  Yeah.  The only other, I brought in some ah, ah, well a very Chinese cookie recipe made with 
lard and then the batter is rolled out.  And, and in little balls.  Ah, and then you sort of glaze it 
with a beaten egg yoke and sprinkle sesame seeds on it.  All right.  And they are not very sweet 
um, and they liked those.  Can my wife make some of those?  You know, um, but now I had one 
sort of party at my house where members of the staff came.  And I said all right now you're going
to have, you know,  you're going to have Indian Food and you're going to have Chinese Food.  
Those are my favorite kinds of things to cook anyway.  And they liked everything.  But no one 
said, "I'd like to make that at home.  How do you do it?"
B:Have you been experimenting with Cambodian cooking?
T:  Well, I can't get anybody to give me recipe.  You know.  Well, you just take some of this, and 
you buy a package of that, and I'm saying it's not going to come out right.  You know, forget it.  
I'm for precise measurements.  Ah, for the big Folk Festival last July, I ah, said that what I would 
do is I would make this [Cambodian Name] the coconut jello with the seaweed all right.  So I 
asked someone how to make it.  And they gave me this, well you take this can of coconut milk 
and you use about a 1\2, maybe 2\3's.  And then you get a package of the seaweed.  And then you
taste it [laugh].  And then you add sugar [laugh].  So I said, "can I please come to your house and
watch you do it?"  All right, so then I, you know, there were no measuring cups.  Just a tea cup, 
and for the number of cups of water.  It was a bowl.  And I said, "well I'm not going to be able to 
duplicate this at home unless we have a standard measure."  So I looked on, in the cupboard and 
found a bowl that I have an exact copy, all right.  So I said, "please let's measure the water with 
this.  And then I will know."  So I wrote down what I was watching, and stirred the pot.  So that 
my hand could get at least a feel of consistency we were talking about.  And ah, went home and 
tried it out.  And then brought the sample in and asked the students in our E.S.L.  class if they 
would mind experimenting.  And that here this was a test.  It was my test.  And I had to know if I
had passed or failed.  Because I wanted them to give an honest answer.  And not just say, "oh, it's
fine."  You know, [laugh] I wanted criticism.  And we got criticism.  Not enough sugar, not 
enough salt, not enough eggs.  You know, and ah, made some arrangements of the basic recipe.  
And then brought another batch in.  And everyone agreed that was terrific.  So, so I knew I 
finally had the right recipe.  And made the pudding for the festival.  And we sold out.  Americans
wanted to try a square and they liked it.  
B:  Really, that's the same as any folk recipe.  Even your own grandmother followed, didn't tell 
you two tablespoons of this.  It's a pinch of
T:  True.  True.  
B:  You know, shake it twice and  
T:  Well, ah, well even my mother
B:  Because you learn from doing it.  You don't learn by writing it down and reading it either.
T:  Yeah, well I know when I used to ask my mother how she made her pie crust.  And my father 
had fabricated out of a piece of sheet metal a scoop, a flour scoop.  And depending on how full or
how empty it was it was this or that.  And so I never really did learn how to make a pie crust.  
And then I married my husband.  And he started raving about his mom's pies.  And that she made
the most terrific pies.  Needless to say I did not experiment with pie crust then.  Until I guess 
we'd been married about six years and ah, it was a family Thanksgiving.  And my mother-in-law 
was bringing the pies.  And I, we went the day before because we were living out of town, out of 
state as a matter of fact.  And I saw that she bought a package of mix at the super market that she 
was crumbling up in this bowl and adding water too.  And I said, "well if that's the greatest pie 
crust in the world.  I can compete with that."  [laugh]  So after, after seeing it and trying it I 
started making pies.  But you're right you know, it's some of this and some of that.  
B:  I'd say their food tends to be more conservative than our culture.  In terms of what people 
retain at home.  
T:  Too  
B:  Rather than die and all, coming here and adopting wholesale, the whole different food ways.  
Food sense to remain.  They might give up dress and their language
T:  Right.
B:  Medical beliefs maybe, and things like that but, food seems to
T:  Yeah, I think, I think you're right.  Ah
B:  In the end for some groups who have been here for generations it's just symbolic of
T:  Yeah.
B:  You know, "I'm Polish so here's the Kilbasa."  You drag it out on special occasions.  And in 
some cases it's the one remnant of, of the old culture and I'm wondering if that
T:  And I've seen that in, in very sophisticated people that I have know.  You know, ah, the 
kilbasa come out.  The, the egg bread at Easter time.
B:  Pork Pie and Pea Soup and
T:  That's right.  And I'll tell you, I, because when I say that my parents came from somewhere 
else they're French Canadian, and I kept, well, I was considerably older but, I would ask my 
mother, you know,  O.K., how did your mother make the Pea Soup?  And I'd ask my father how 
his mother made the Pea Soup you know, and they were slightly different.  And I kept 
experimenting.  Till I had what I thought I liked best as Pea Soup.  And what came close to what 
my mother made.  Ah, wrote it down, and I'm very consistent about this, I don't know why it is 
but I insist on measuring everything.  And ah, so that it tastes the same.  Unless the recipe isn't 
right and then it's modified until it is right.  Ah, I guess I should say food is my hobby.  [laugh]  
Ah, but ah, I had some Pea Soup at the Folk Festival.  As far as I'm concerned it was nothing like
the kind I make.  You know, it was totally different.  And I liked mine better.  Ah, Meat Pies, we 
have Meat Pies on New Years Day.  It is traditional.  I don't care when you make it.  That's when,
I have a big freezer.  I can make them ahead.  Freeze them, but we always have Meat pies on, on 
ah, New Years Day.  And that's another thing.  Some people put a little potato in it.  Some don't.  
Um, my mother because she had Gall-bladder problem ah, said, you know,  "we don't use all 
pork hamburger.  We'll use two pounds of beef and one of pork because we have to have the pork
flavor.  But I can't have all that pork."  And so, and then, I think it may be because my mother 
liked the flavoring of the meat pies.  But it was too much trouble to make it often.  So she 
invented this dish which we called Canadian Chili.  [laugh]  Which has no Chili in it at all.  But 
it's just the ground hamburger seasoned with cinnamon and clove, cooked up well, and you 
throw a can of Baked Beans in it.  Stir it all up and we love it.  Tastes very different from other 
things but
B:  Do you think there are [unclear] in the Cambodian Community in terms of special foods, and 
foods that may become emblematic maybe down the road?  
T:  Well, I think that the
B:  Are there are a lot of regional variation too?
T:  Well, I've had the little Egg Rolls.  You know, the Spring Rolls they're called by some people. 
Um, from different sources, different cooks.  And there are differences, you know,  ah, I've had 
Fried Rice that tasted very different.  The way one person cooked it and another person cooked 
it.  And I think that's to be expected.  You know, recipes evolve in families as well as a norm.
B:  Very special ceremonies [unclear] 
T:  Well, I don't know exactly what you mean by ceremonies. You know, if you're talking about 
weddings.  If you're talking about a religious festival at the Temple
B:Something they serve on their New Year or
T:  Well
B:  You know, when someone wants to do a special dinner not a run of the mill ordinary 
everyday dinner.  Would that be different?
T:  Well, I think, not because I've been invited to anyone's house for a special dinner. You know, 
I've eaten just, whenever it's there you know.  Ah, um, but when for instance people are getting 
married.  a lot of people um, well some of them rent the Smith Baker Center, and have brought in
either, families have chipped in and cooked or someone local is hired to do that, or there is a 
caterer from Boston.  I think a Chinese family that have come out and done these weddings.  And
the latest thing is going to a Chinese Restaurant and having the you know, so many courses 
served there.  And ah, again it's people who, who have a higher stature make a big point of 
showing that.  By making sure that there are nine courses instead of seven like at so and so's 
wedding.  You know, I mean it's like everybody else.  [laugh]  Ah, and always you have Fried 
Rice because Plain Rice is everyday.  And that's the one thing I know.  So I would imagine on a, 
a, when people are having their, their relatives ah, coming to visit them for the New Year 
celebration ah, they probably would have Fried Rice instead of Plain Rice at their meals.  So, 
what special dishes I really, I really don't know.  It might be, you know, similar to our Christmas 
Dinners, if in some families you only have a Turkey.  In other families it's always Ham.  In other 
families it might be a Goose and or, 
B:  Or in Virginia Oyster Stew.
T:  Yeah, that's right, that's right.  And ah, so in some families it might be traditional to have a 
particular dish that's time consuming to make but special.  That might not appear somewhere 
else.  I can't tell you that.
B:  One thing I think would be interesting for this project to document would be just a typical 
meal.  From the preparation all the way through serving the meal.
T:  Yeah.  Well, when you were at the Temple was Mrs. Chun there?  
B:  Ah.
T:  Or has her name come up?  
B:  I might know her by sight.
T:  She's kind of a, I hate to say heavy set.  For a Cambodian she is.  All right, ah, because so 
many are just so thin and small.  And she's an excellent cook.  And I don't know if it's spelled 
C-H-U-N or C-H-H or if it's an O-E-U-N.  Her husband died
B:  Last summer, O.K.
T:  Last summer right.  
B:  Yeah, I saw, I've met her.  She showed me snap-shots of the funeral.  
T:  O.K.  
B:  I don't know.  She must be related to ah, [unclear] Phen perhaps.  Because I know she's been 
over at the house on East Franklin which would be [unclear] or two.  
T:  O.K., O.K., and she helps ah, at the Temple quite a bit.  And ah, she's the lady who ah, in 
previous ah, New Year's Celebrations, any activities we've, we've had has done cooking for the 
M.A.A.  You know, ah, ah, for the festival, there was no way.  We had to get a different cook.  
And ah, ah, that person, you know, the flavor was different than we, it's traditional that when we 
are doing one of these festivals whether it's New Years where it's mostly for the Cambodian 
people.  Or um, the Folk Art Festival and it's for the american People.  Traditionally the foods 
that we have are the egg Rolls, Fried Rice and the Beef on the Stick.  And the cook we had for 
July ah, uses a lot more ginger in her Beef on a Stick than Mrs. Chun.  O.K., different flavor, I 
can't say that I like one more than the other.  They were both great.  Because I happen to like 
garlic.  And Mrs. Chun's the garlic really gets you, [laugh] you know.  So
B:  Ginger too.
T:  Yeah, yeah.  So it was different.  Equally good, ah, ah, her Fried ice was, I kept, as I doled it 
out, you know,  I kept trying to see.  What's in there?  you know.  That makes it so good.  But 
some kind of little sausage that got chopped into small pieces.  As well as little pieces of chicken 
and shrimp.  Ah, excellent flavor.  Ah, so I think, you know, if you talk to Chun she'd ah, and 
we're good friends.  She's a special lady.  
B:  She seems very nice.
T:  Yeah, she is.  So
D:  Could you let me in by asking ah
B:  Aside from [unclear laughter] aside from anything I've missed.  Which is quite a bit probably.
D:  Ah, what about the outside community?  I mean their perceptions and their, are their 
problems?  
T:  Well, I
D:  With [unclear] person did they find jobs and you know?
T:  Well, as far as job are concerned.  Ah, we have, you know, employers who are happy and sad.
All right.  They are happy when, because of the productivity level of the Cambodian workers.  
They are sad because, frequently they don't call up if they are not coming.  Or they quit the job 
without notice. You know, one of our major employers ah, I think has something like three 
hundred and fifty Cambodians working there.  Ah, and most of them are on second shift.  [phone 
rings in background]  Huge number and
B:  Are those assembly of some kind?
T:  Machine operating.  
B:  Oh.
T:  Basically.  I mean do you give brand names?  [laugh]
B:  Sure.
T:  It's B.A.S.F.  That makes all the audio-tapes and stuff.  And video-tapes and, ah
B:  Easy [unclear] 
T:  [laugh]  Another company ah, down the road from them ah, works in optics and doesn't have 
ant Cambodians and decided that they might like to look into this.
B:  Ah ha.  
T:  And what we found are, course we've, you know, the, the market right now, there are more 
jobs than there are people to fill them.  So companies have had to get competitive and pay a 
higher wage.  If they want to attract the workers.  Ah, so this company that dealt with Optics.  We
basically said, "what's your pay scale for entry level you know."  And especially if we're talking 
limited English.  And they told us what their standard entry level pay scale was.  And I said, 
"unless you up the anti.  You're not going to get anybody, because your neighbor down the street 
is paying a dollar an hour more. You know, no one is going to go for $4.50 if they can get $5.50.  
Well, yes but we, we'd be training in the, and there'd be special skills and you can go up to, you 
know,  $9.00 an hour.  It's today that the rent is due.  Right?  You've got to get it now.  Ah, so we 
never did finalize anything with that company.  But they raised the question on you know, we 
hear that they're good workers.  Are they?  And we said, "  call B.A.S.F.  Production went up 
35%.  Don't take our word for it.  Call them up."  
B:  Yeah.
T:  So ah, so that's the, that's why we get, we'll get
D:  Something like that might cause problems with the non-Asians workers?
T:  Well, I haven't
D:  It's like in a sense showing them up.  
T:  Yes, so I think eventually they get the whole shift with nothing but Southeast Asians.  [laugh] 
D:  Can I just see, don't mind me, [unclear] my tape.  
T:  Yeah, we have had, we have had employers, I've had them say to me, "now I can't say this 
publicly.  But we would like to get rid of these other workers.  We would rather have Southeast 
Asians."  You know, and I say, "you're right.  You can't say that publicly."  
D:  [laugh]  Right.  
T:  You know.  Ah, so we have, we have that kind of thing.  We also have going back several 
years, when the community wasn't as large.  Ah, ah people quit a job um, for reasons that, I don't 
know why they would do that you know.  Why don't you just ask somebody?  Don't just quit.  
Ah, one odd reason was, they don't have a Coke machine.  The other odd reason was, there was a
Spanish person that said, "hey, babe!"  That was an insult.  I said, "you know, did you talk back? 
Did you say, please, that's not according to my custom.  No, just walked off the job.  It's not the 
bosses fault, you know.  [laugh]  And I'm sure that, well I'm not sure but, someone was just 
trying to be friendly.  Ah, but now, ah, one of the things, you know, we tend to see more ah, 
representative of the community and agencies who want to learn about the culture.  Who want to 
have an exchange.  Who want to help in the process of assimilation.  Then we would see the 
people who are negative.  
D:  Right.
T:  Because they're not going to bother coming here.  That's going to happen out in the field.  Ah,
so, so
D:  You would know about it.  It would be for people who come here and talk about it, or 
mention it.  
T:  That's right.
D:  If there's a problem
T:  That's right, um.  We know that ah, and it's been ah, expressed publicly.  That the response by 
the police department to a call for you know, a complaint, children are throwing rocks at the 
house.  Ah, other emergencies ah, they just feel that they are not getting the same kind of 
response.  You know.  And I've talked to people and said well, if the police department is, is 
under staffed and if someone who is, you know, a wealthy American calling from a certain 
address, if it takes twenty minutes before they get a response then there's nothing much you can 
do but to vote for a bigger police force.  But, if that person gets a response in a few minutes, and 
you have to go back the next day and still say, "I didn't hear from anyone."  Then that's not 
proper.  But there have been statements made that the police do not respond.  Ah, City Hall since 
ah, that ah, was done publicly.  The Governor has an advisory committee hold hearings um, here.
Ah, the police department has tried to, the city has tried to help the police department to ah, be 
more responsive.  Hire someone who will be available with bi, you know, bi-lingual capacity for 
the police department.  For emergency services.  Ah, so City Hall has been trying to do things.  
Um, the official response ah, from ah, the Mayor, the previous Mayor, the City Manager it has 
been very positive.  It's been an out reach to this community.  Ah, I think Lowell is probably ah, 
different from many cities.  Because it was built as a city of, well it was built for mill girls, but, 
then it became a city of immigrants.  And they've all had their problems, they've all had ah, their 
growing pains.  And but they've all evolved and they know now for the next group.  
D:  And Lowell officially hospitable.
T:  Yeah.
D:  To the [unclear].
T:  Yeah, now I know that was some, um, ramification in the Hispanic Community when a 
Cambodian was named to the Zoning Board of Appeals.  How come one of us hasn't been 
named?  They're newer.  It should be our turn, O.K.  Ah, that caused a little bit of at least in the 
news papers.  I didn't think it increased any friction in the neighborhood.  Ah, on the other hand 
with the school situation and the Hispanic Children being out placed last year.  And the 
Cambodian Children being out of the normal school ah, buildings.  Ah, have been working 
together.  For equal education for all our children.  So ah, you know, and I keep saying, "well as 
long as your children know that you're working together.  How can your children not get along." 
So ah, there are feelings ah, of apprehension about ah, Hispanics by the Cambodian youth?  
B:  Yeah.  [unclear] by Cambodians?
T:  Yeah.  Ah
B:  Do you feel almost a sense of almost jealously?  
T:  Well, the jealously comes up with, how come the Cambodian got named to the City Board?  
D:  [unclear] I think it's more everyday than that.
T:  Well, there are
D:  Work two jobs you have more.
T:  True.
D:  You have more, you have money.  And you might have a nicer car.  
T:  That's right.
D:  It's a visible symbol of
T:  That's right.
D:  Success.
T:  And when there's a lot of fuss made over the Cambodian student has learned so fast, O.K.  
And what their saying is, "this child has an excuse because he's been here three years.  And his 
parents have been here three years.  You have been here, you were born here, and you still don't 
speak English."  And what I say to my comm, ah, my leaders is, "you can show them the way.  
And they have to be prepared for the next wave.  Whether those are Ethiopians or Afghanises 
they have to show the way.  Yeah."  [phone rings in background]  They think I'm a little odd, but 
that's all right.  You have to be a little odd to work here.  [laugh]  That's my stock answer.  I don't 
know what else, what other specific areas
B:  [unclear]
T:  O.K.  
B:  Let me get back
T:  O.K.  Let me make a note
B:  You taught me to ah, what was her name?  
T:  The high school, ah, the
B:  She's going to the Community College.
T:  The Community College.  Her name is Sithran Chan.
B:  You'll have to spell it.
T:  Yeah, S-I-T-H-R-A-N one word, and than C-H-A-N.
B:  And Chan would be her last name.  
T:  Right.  And we call her, Ran.  Ah, every child in that families first name starts with S-I-T-H.  
And then has a different ending.  Except for the baby.  The one who is like second or third grade 
now.  So I said to Ran one day, "how come all, you know, your brother is, you know, Sith 
Swoon, you're Sith Ran.  We have Sith Not, we have Sith Sook, you know, how come 
everybody's got this?  And she said, "because it had something to do with my fathers name and 
my fathers family."  Then I said, "well, why didn't the youngest child?"  And she wasn't born in 
the U.S., you know, she was born in the camps.  Well, I said, "how come she doesn't have it?"  
She said, "my mother got tired of it."  [laugh] 
B:  Well, one day I'm talking to a man whose name is Sergeant.  
T:  Sergeant.
B:  And
T:  Cambodian?
B:  Yeah, and I was asking [unclear] one time about it.  Well, it's just like in the army.  [unclear] 
said O.K.
T:  [Laughter]  Well, one
B:  Might have been born when American troops were there or something.  And somehow got the
name.
T:  Yeah, it could have been
