[Letter from Edward N. Waters to Carita Doggett Corse,
July 18, 1940]
July 18, 1940
Dr. Carita Doggett Corse State Supervisor Florida Writers' Project Jacksonville, Florida
Dear Dr. Corse:
We are investigating the matter of Mr. Morris's records of Greek folk songs. In a short time
it will be finally settled.
I must ask you now to send us our recording machine by the first of August. It will be
needed up here by then for other work. Please send it direct to the Music Division, Library
of Congress. I hope the extension of the loan resulted in some good recordings.
Sincerely yours, Edward N. Waters Acting Chief, Division of Music
