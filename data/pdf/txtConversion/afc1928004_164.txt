Daily Alta Cakforli:ai, San Francisco, Cal 
Messrs. SHERIDAN & MAcK, ui.0 acter artists, at present with 
Emerson's Minstrels, at the Alhambra, are worthy of more 
than a 
passing notice for the excel!ent manner in which their 
acts are performed, and they icdv deserve the great populari-
ty they have achieved in origin tting a 
line of business in a 
field so thoroughly worked. 
performances differ from 
anYthinkattetiipteti by other performers, and fur the time they 
are on thostage, you can hardy realize it is the same parties 
personating the different characters. 
Their " Old Couple" is 
a thorough artistic - inpersonation, 
and everything they do 
has an elegance and grace with it which cannot fail to please 
overyhody who witnesses their admirable performances, 
New York Cityper, AuLr. 7th, 15.72. 
SHERIDAN & MACK in their ei:tracter duets, have made rapid 
strides towards excellence Eine they last appeared here. 
Their personations of the aged couple u " Look on the Bright 
Side" approximates well nigh unto derfection, as the loud and 
continued pplause of the audience. testified. 
After an „lmost 
instantaneous change of costume, they )( funded on the mimic 
scene as a 
boy and girl, and illustrate. " Playing .
ifookey," 
which although well performed, did not c,qual in artLtic excel-
lence their first effort. " The Little Fraud" was next given, 
and in a 
style of excellence, both as regards make 
singing, 
and acting, that we have seldom seen equaled. 
They were 
twice recalled, and the applause continuing, they gave a 
single 
verse of a 
Dutch duet, which met with favor, 
Washington Journal. 
SHERIDAN & MACK are the best character art its that have 
ever appeared in this city, if their equals exist, which after 
the representation of last evening, may well be doubted. 
Their 
make-ups are perfect, and their acting entirely in keeping with 
the characters assumed, particularly so in the case of Shefidan, 
who plays the female parts and dresses them so perfectly as to 
-
0Ceive the entire audience. 
Their sketches were the ,gein of 
te & ening.

Biographical Sketch. 
I, 
Messrs. SHERIDAN ,K; 
MACK* are natives of Providence, It. 
I., 
and first appeared on the public stage as Double Clog isancers 
under the assumed name of TIIE SLITErt BROTHERS. 
Their par-
ents not wishing them to adopt the stage for a 
profession they 
had to run away from their home. So on one pleasant evening, 
in the month of April, two stage-struck mechanics might have 
been seen lowering their wardrobe ( consisting of a 
pair of clogs, 
knee-pants, ruffled shirt,—home-made—and a 
pair of stock- ie. 
ing,$), out of a 
window at their respective homes. 
The compa-
ny with which they first a-
2, pearcd was Frank Forrest's Min-
strels, and their debut was made at Pawtucket, R. I., on April 
12th, 1864. 
This monster organization, consisting of the only 
Ned Turner, Harry Butler, Dick Prior, and others, concluded 
after a 
three months' tour to lay up for the balance of the man-
ager's existence, so the Sliter Bros. returned to their homes 
crowned with honors, and for awhile were the lions of Provi-
dence. 
Their next attempt was with Chadwick & Webb's 
Minstrels, who after running two consecutive weeks suddenly 
retired, the managers having made reputation enough, went 
into some other business for money. 
The Sliters however, not 
being without some little talent, met a 
good samaritan, in the 
person of Johnny Whiting, the Comedian, who took them to 
New York, and got them an opening at Butler's American 
Theatre, 444 Broadway; here they adopted their real names—. 
Sheriaan & )ink, and advanced very rapidly in their profes. 
5 
cTi 
elen. 
Their next move was to Wood's Minstrels, S1.4 broad-
way. 
Tony Pastor and Sam Sharply, about to start a 
travel-
ing company, engaged them. 
They remained with this com-
pany till some ti:r.e after their opening, at 201 Bowery, and 
were then engaged with Morris Bros. & Trowbridge's Minstrels, 
Boston, Mass. 
They remained with this company over two 
sears, and having made rapid advances in their business, were 
engaged by R. M. ..Ilooley, of the Brooklyn and Seventh Street, 
Philadelphia, Opera Houses. 
At the opening of the great Tammany Hall, New York, they 
were engaged, and as they were no black face acts permitted, 
they there adopted a new line of business—doing song and 
dances and character songs in white faces. 
Messrs. Sheridan 
Mack are the originals of this line of business, and to-day 
stand at the head of their profession. 
They are sought after 
by all our enterprising managers, and have lately returned 
from a 
second engagement in San Francisco, Cal., (where they 
made an enviable reputation,) under the management of Thos. 
Mne-
,tdre, 
the Pioneer Manager of California- 
They are at 
present with Messrs. Maguire A; Emerson's Minstrels, 720 
Broadway, New York, where they are being received nightly 
in their original specialties with unbounded enthusiasm, and 
keknowledmd by the press and public, as par excellence.

THE DASHING, GAY BRUNETTE, 
Words by J. F. 
SHERIDAN. 
GOOD-EVENING friends, I 
hope you're well, 
To you a 
story I 
will tell, 
How head and ears in love I 
fell, 
With a 
dashing, gay brunette, 
The first time that I 
met her 
She was riding in a 
car. 
A 
gentleman was with her, 
I 
think it was her pa; 
I 
arose, and said, " Will you accept my my seat r 
She smiled, and thanked me 
(Snit.) With a 
smile so sweet, 
This dashing, gay brunette. 
We smiled and flirted as oniwe rode, • 
I 
followed her to her abode, 
Into her hand I 
slipped a 
note, 
Asking if I 
might on her call. 
Next day I 
got an answer, 
It filled me with delight, 
Stating I 
might call 
The coming Sunday night. 
I 
read and read her letter o'er again, 
(Srm.) I 
thought-myself the happiest of men, 
Oh my dashing, gay brunette. 
At the appointed time I 
rang the bell, 
'Twas answered by my little Nell, 
Her blushing face at once did tell, 
Watching she had been for me. 
No longer could I 
conceal it, 
So I 
told her of my love, 
And vowed I 
would be true to her 
As the stars above. 
She said that she could love none else but me, 
pant.) So next week I 
will married be 
To my dashing, gay brunette. 
It 
I'M SEVENTY FIVE: 
I'M seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
The merriest old man that's alive, 
I'm seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
And to be jolly I 
contrive. 
All care and sorrow we drive awa) 
We take our toddy three times a 
day. 
CHORUS. 
Then hickity pickity ain't, it glee, 
To laugh and sing and dance like rue, 
Our heads are clear, our hearts are free. 
We're a 
merry old nouple you'll all agree, 
I'm seventy-five, I'm seventy-five, 
The jolliest old man that's alive, 
I'm:seventy-five, I'm seventy-five. 
And to belhappy we contrive; 
I 
remember forty years ago, 
At New Orleans I 
fought the foe, 
I 
went to the polls in my soldier coat, 
• And for General Jackson 
Cast my vote.

SWELL SINGS. — WHILE walking out one evening, 
And strolling down Broadway, 
The moon was shining brightly, 
And everything looked gay; 
Just as I 
cast my eyes up, 
A 
lovely girl I 
saw, 
Standing at the counter, 
Of a 
fancy dry good's store. 
CHORUS. 
Her face it was bewitching, 
Here eyes they were so bright, 
My heart with love was bursting, 
I 
loved her at first sight. 
Bzum SINGS.—I'm here to keep my premise, 
With a 
young man who last night 
Talked such strains of love to me, 
And squeezed my hand so tight, 
I 
hope he'll not deceive me, 
The clock has just struck nine, 
Swiux SINGS.-0h, here I 
am my darling, 
And hope that I'm in time.

Your pretty face at sight, 
And now to make me happy 
Just name the day so bright.

But if you'll call and see mama, 
No doubt she'll name the day.

sixty years together we've been.

We're always as you see us.

If you wish to make life last, 
Look upon the bright side, 
You'll find it the better plan. 
When we were young and in our primer 
We used to like to have a 
good time, 
And even now, we're not behind, 
The young folks at their play. 
We like to see each one enjoy, 
The time allotted girl or boy, 
But pray you don't your live's destroy, 
For soon we're called away.

When we walk out the people shout, 
They like to see our fond affection 
And when they smile to see our style.

And a 
sly meeting stole 
With my sweetheart in the garden,

When there we first did meet, 
And quickly asked her pardon. 
Then she pouted, and said I

This pretty, little belle. (Sy.) 
She stamped her little foot 
And looked so haughty, 
I 
promised not to tell. (STK.) 
Ctiosus. 
She had golden hair and rosy cheeks. 
Eyes like cupid's lances. 
She won my heart that very night, 
With her fascinating glances

When I 
my love did tell,

Written by J. D. KELLY; for SHERIDAN &WADE.' 
ErrEn No. 1. —A VERY strange thing I've happened to see, 
That is a 
young fellow who looks just like me, 
In fact my fac-simile, dresses the same, 
I'm determined to find out who he is and his 
name. 
I 
saw him to day out cutting a 
shine, 
With coat, pants, and vest, hat, and shoes just 
like pine, 
My senses I 
doubted, ne'er thought there could 
be, 
A 
fellow existing so much like me. 
CAMEL 
re's so much like me, yes, he's so much like me, 
In fact, I 
never saw before such a 
fac-simile, 
It may appear quite funny, but at it I 
can't laugh, 
For it's not a 
pleasant thing to have a 
living photograph. 
N(TER No. 2.—I've seen .a 
great deal as life I've passed through, 
But nothing has so much surprised me 'tis true, 
As a 
man who a 
moment ago did inc pass, 
I 
thought I 
was gazing in a 
looking-glass; 
Astonished I 
stood, quite still in the street; 
We starM at each other as our eyes did meet, 
We're as Inuch like each other as pea is to pea, 
Be dresses, looks, walks, so exactly like me. 
Re's so much like. le.c.

LINES Written on Reading The New York 
Clipper Crosswise. 
By Miss M IRE LANE. 
Dedicated to SHERIDAN & M ACZ. 
HOW pleasant 'tis when one has time, 
The papers all to rend, 
And see in the advertisements, 
What, every one may need. 
I 
always read the Clipper, 
Nor think the time a 
loss, 
From top to bottom I 
don't go, 
But always straight across. 
Tony Pastor sings new songs, 
And Polly Daly too; 
A 
gymnast wishing to adopt 
A 
girl of twenty-two; 
A 
ballet-girl desired for 
Astrology to teach; 
To cure neuralgia just try, 
Ofity Gooft's last speech. 
Lydia Thompson was under bail, 
For striking poor old Story; 
Harry Bloodgood appears to-night, 
As Adolphus Morning Glory; 
Charlie Shay will play in Stoneham, 
That lively little town; 
25,0 
Young Weston ran 9, foot-race., 
A 
challenge for Walter Brown. 
Lotta scents her handkerchief 
With Whitney's fine pale ale; 
Ed James supplies the sporting men, 
A 
tine wood-cut for sale; 
Charlie Shattuck sings to-night, 
The Young Girl in the Lane; 
Dave Reed will introduce us to 
His Jennie Jerusha Jane. 
Ten dollars reward for Andy McKee, 
And the girl with the auburn curls; 
Sheridan & Mack will open soon, 
A 
dancing-school for girls; 
You'll find them at the Globe, 
Where their talents soon will tell; 
First appearance in fifteen months, 
Of the New York Swell and Belle. 
Annie Swan has left us, 
But of course is coming back; 
And they say intends to marry 
Bryant's Little Mack; 
Lina Edwin's great success— 
A 
Saturday matinee, 
Stuart Robson's cracked heart, 
I 
know not why. I 
love thee.

The Old Home* Ain't What it Used 6 
Be. 
By C. A. WHITE. 
OH, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The banjo and the riddle has gone, 
And no more you hear the darkies singing, 
Among the sugar cane and corn; 
Great changes have come to the poor colored than, 
But this change makes him sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Among the sugar cane and corn. 
CHORUS. 
NO, the old home ain't what it used to be, 
The change makes ma sad and folorn, 
For no more we hear the darkies singing 
Arn-ong the sugar cane and corn. 
In the fields I've worked when I 
thought 'twas hatd, 
But night bro't its pleasure and rest, 
In the old house down by the river side, 
The place of all the world the best. 
Oh, where are the children that once used to play 
In the lane by the old cabin door, 
They are scattered.now and o'er the world they roank 
The old man ne'er will see them more. 
No, the old home, Ice. 
Now the old man would rather lived and died 
In the home where his children were born, 
But when freedom .came to the colored man, 
He left the cotton-field and corn. 
This old man has lived out his three score and tens 
And he'll soon have to . ay down and die, 
Yet he hopes to go unto a 
better land, 
110W old cabin home, good-bye.'

DRIVING IN. TIE PARK.. 
Words by J. F. SHERIDAN. 
THE other day to pass away the time, 
My friend and I, 
Took a 
drive through Central Park, 
To see the styles pass by; 
The fashionable belles and swells, 
Happy seemed to be, 
All were gay and pleasant 
With spirits light and free. 
While riding on and talking 
Of the different style, 
We saw two ladies walking, 
So at them we did smile; 
They didn't seem offended, 
Nor cast an angry look, 
And as on their way the wended, 
Their handkerchiefs they shook. 
Driving in the park, boys, 
Driving in the park, 
There's nothing half so jolly, 
As a 
good drive through the park. 
When you're feeling lonely, 
And want to have a' lark, 
Tak, a 
good companion, and 
Go driving in the park. 
Next morning in the Herald, 
An advertisement we saw, 
'Twas from the two fair maidens 
We met the day before. 
'Twas first among the personals, 
And meant for us no doubt. 
I'll read it for you—here it is— 
I'm glad I 
cut it out, 
If the gentlemen who in the park. 
Two young ladies did meet, 
Wishes to see them, call at 20 
street." 
Of course' we're going to see them, 
So we'll bid you all adieu, 
We'll come again to-morrow, 
And our meeting tell to you.

About a

A

And winked at me so sly, 
Whilst riding in a

(R4peat Chorus) 
As I 
alone was sitting, 
She through the car came flitting, 
I 
watched her with enraptured gaze, 
As she was tripping by. 
My heart was gone completely, 
Her eyes they beamed so sweetly, 
I 
smiled at her she smiled at me, 
And then she winked her eye. 
Riding in, tta. 
At last we reached the station, 
Which was our destination, 
I 
lost sight of the pretty girl, 
Who stole my heart away; 
But soon I 
mean tolind her, 
And then I 
will remind her. 
About that small flirtation, 
We had the other day.

A 
BIT OF MY MIND. 
I
' M 
not of a 
quarrelsome nature at all, 
But a 
peaceable sort of a 
man. 
And I 
always avoid a 
dispute or a 
brawl. 
That's to say, if I 
possibly can: 
Still if people behave in an insolent way, 
Or to argue or fight are inclin'd, 
Why I 
first listen calmly to all they've to say, 
Then I 
give them a 
bit of my mind. 
Cuontrs. 
k 
bit of my mind, a 
bit of my mind, 
if friends or relations should e'er prove unkind, 
You cannot conceive the relief that I 
find, 
If Fm able to give them a 
piece of my mind. 
When a 
wild little urchin of seven years old, 
I 
was under a 
pedagogue's rule, 
And the first time I 
got into trouble, I'm told. 
Was for smashing a 
win

But I 
didn't much care tho' they flo ,,,t'd me by force, 
For I 
gave them a 
bit of mind. 
. . . 
A 
bit of my mind, ttc. 
I've been sadly deceiv'd by my intimate friend, 
The' I 
treated him just like a 
prince, 
For he too'..: all the cash I 
could manage to lend, 
And I've never set eyes on him since; "-
Still I 
wrOtelim aletter, indignant and strong, 
Full of all the bad names I 
couhl find,-
And it pleas'd me to think, tho' his conduct was wrong. 
That I 
gave him a 
bit of my mind. 
A 
bit of my mind, &o. 
So if ever I'm injued.or.treated amiss, 
My behavior is always the .sarne,.. 
And I've one satisfaction at least which is this, 
•,. 
That I 
don't think I'm greatly to blame. 
If ray wife should elope with a 
rival to-day, 
(The' I 
might not at first be resiLe,0.1,) 
I 
should feel myself 'better. I'm happy to say,

WAITING AT THE WELL 
ON the seat by the well I 
am waiting my love, 
And list for your footsteps so dear, 
The fair stars of ev'ning are shining above, 
A4 I'm waiting to welcome you here. 
The soft wind is wafting the nightingale's song, 
So sweet o'er the meadows to me. 
And the rivulet's stream goes murm'ring along. 
As I 
wait at the well love for thee. 
CHOBtr& 
refoi• thee I 
am waiting, rm waiting hero to-night, 
And for your voice I 
listen in the dell, 
Beside the chestnut tree, and the pale moon's silver light, 
I 
am waiting, yes; waiting at the well. 
Then haste to my side love, the twilight is fading, 
The birds are all nestled to rest, 
And hushed are the sounds of the murmuring river, 
And silent the wind in the west. 
Come forth from thy casement, for thee I 
am pining. 
Oh, come o'er the meadows to me, 
Thi blue sky is smiling, the moon it is shining, 
As 1 
wait at the well love, for thee. 
Yee, for thee, *a 
4.1 
There's Nothing Succeeds like Success. 
IN days that are gone, you'll allow me to state, 
I 
was kick'd thro' the world like a 
foot ball of Fate, 
And fortune kept me a 
long time at her gate, 
(Alt! those were the days of dieress,) 
But still I 
knock'd boldly, and whcn once allow'd, 
To bask in her favor, I 
found quito a 
crowd, 
Of people who cringingly fiatter'd and bowed, 
And willing to worship success. 
CHORUS. 
It's all very well to say Fortune is blind, 
Keep on persevering, and make up your mind 
To go in and win, then you'll certainly find, 
There's nothing succeeds like success. 
When I 
was poor and in want of a 
friend, 
I 
scarcely found one on whom I 
could depend, 
Now there are scores who are willing to lend, 
And favors on me would pour. 
The rosebuds of fortune, by thorns are beset, 
And those who would pluck them discover, and yet, 
If nothing you'll venture, why nothing you'll get, 
So let this be ever your creed. 
Its all very, &c. 
If Fortune is stalling what crowd will appear, 
Their kindness to offer and friendship sincere, 
Yet change but the prospects they'll all disappear, 
When trouble she raps at your door. 
Nothing put off which can be done to day, 
While the sun shines is the time to make hay, 
Exert yourself manfully, make no delay, 
And in time you are bound to succeed, 
It's all very, la. 
It's about a 
little girl that I 
know, 
She's fairer than all the flowers in Spring, 
Is this pretty little girl that I 
know;_, 
She's all the rage, we are engaged, 
flow happy I 
shall be, 
she's in her teens, and just sixteen, 
And says she'll marry me. 
Oh! shedl the rage, we are engage&

The first time I 
saw her 'twas in the Park, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know, 
I 
spoke to her just for a 
lark, 
Thisfpretty little girl that I 
know. 
When she rolled her eye, I 
thought I'd die,-
As she turned and winked at me, 
She wears one curl, does this sweet girl, 
Arittshe's going to marry me. 
Oh! she's, &o. 
She's got lots of money, and so she says— 
This pretty little girl that I 
know— 
She falls into property some fine day, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know. 
Her father's .fast, he deals in gas, 
He's gone for his.iler,dth they say, 
_ 
He's gone for his health, left her his wealth, 
And she's going to marry Inc. 
On! she's, &e. 
When I 
am married to Louist, Jane, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know, 
Louisa, Jane, that is her name, 
This pretty little girl that I 
know.

saw knr to-day; when on my way, 
With a 
fellow about six foot five! 
Oh

sayings now are all the rage, 
We've new ones every day: 
rve heard folks cry, " I'll have your hat!" 
And, " What will mother say!" 
But the latest I'll now give to you, 
Which causes me much strife, 
'For whene'er I'm out the urchins shout— 
"

Whilst strolling there upon the sands,

met, 
It rained in torrents as she did

thought I'd take, 
When a 
chap who played a 
Ede, 
Said—" Please to spare a 
copper, sir,

If you don't I'll tell your wife," 
I'll tell, es*. 
My temper it does agitate, 
Whene'er that threat I 
hear; 
Those urchins—if they don't desist, 
Will drive me to my bier (
beer) 
Kind friends, myself on you I 
throw, 
But pray don't tell my wife, 
If I 
should sing another song, 
Or it may cause more strife.

Don't tell my wife, don't tell my wit's, 
Or it may cause me strife;

Arrived on the Parade, an excitement quir6 I 
made; 
I 
was mobbed by a 
crowd I 
scarce could pass, 
And the little boys all cried, as they around me hied, 
" 
I 
say Bill, look! here's a 
woman made of glass." 
I 
wondered what they meant, as on the pier I 
went, 
And I 
heard a 
peg-top whiskered fellow say, 
"Awl if there were a 
smash, aw I 
what an awful crash, / 
And what a 
lot of glass to sweep away." 
• Oh I 
never, &c. 
Whichever way I-went, all seem'd on laughter bent, 
And said, " What fun !" " Ha! ha!" and " What a 
lark," 
" 
There the glass of fashion goes," said a 
swell with turnet) 
nose, 
And I 
heard another fast young man remark, 
"'Twas nothing more or less than I 
wore a 
glace dress," 
Another said, " I 
had a 
glassy stare," 
When a 
gentlemanly chap did me on the shoulder tap, 
And told me I 
was labelled " Glass—with care," 
Ohl I 
never, Le. 
The truth I 
then found out, and the crowd they gave a 
shout, 
When tho gentleman he offered me his arm, 
And that same day understand, he offered me his hand 
And his heart, and a 
pretty little farm. 
In a 
fortnight we were wed, and ever since he's said 
lie thinks me the fairest of the fair, 
And all his time he'll pass with me, his darling lass, 
And le ireats his dear good-looking-glass with care. 
Oh? I

WHO WILL HAVE ONE FOR A

NO doubt there's many here that may, 
Have met with we before; 
My mission is to make you rich, 
And benefit the poor; 
So come along and round me throng,

To SCi\ 
vd all I'm willing;-
Who'll buy one, who'll buy one ? 
Who'll have this one for a 
shilling? 
Perhaps you think I'm joking, 
Or cheating you somehow; 
To prove that I'm in earnest, 
I'm going to fill one now, 
flat you must be very careful, and 
To watch me you must try, 
For the quickness of the hand, 
Sometimes deceives the eye.

Sometimes I 
stand within a

And sometimes on a

The publb with their pieces part, 
And think that I'm a

But when they peep inside the purse, 
To see what they have bought, 
Although they find some coin, they think. 
It's hardly the right sorL 
Sromr.— Yes, one old boy had the confounded cheek the 
other day to come and tell me he'd only found a 
penny in his 
purse instead of a 
dollar! I 
said, " Buy another, old boy, and 
don't open it till you get home." Ile did and when he got home
