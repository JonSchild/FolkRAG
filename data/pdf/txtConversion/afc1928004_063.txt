PULLING HARD AGAINST THE STREAM. 
IN 
the world I've gained my knowledge, 
And for it have had to pay. 
Though I 
never went to college, 
Yet I've heard that poets say, 
" 
Life is like a 
mighty river, 
Rolling on from day to day : 
Men are vessels launched upon it, 
Sometimes wrecked and cast away." 
CHORUS. 
So then, do your best for one another, 
Making life a 
pleasant dream : 
Help a 
worn and weary brother, 
Pulling hard against the stream. 
Many a 
bright good-hearted fellow, 
Many a 
noble- minded man, 
Finds himself in water shallow ; 
Then assist him, if you can. 
Some succeed at every turning, 
Fortune favors every scheme ; 
Report of the Beardsley Divorce Case. 
Containing all the evidence suppressed by the papers.

Don',, give way to foolish sorrow, 
Let tins keep you in good cheer; 
Brighter days may come to- morrow, 
If you try and persevere ;

Longest lanes must have a

And the tide will turn at last.

SWEET LSABELLA. 
I 
LovE sweet Isabella. 
She loves another fellow. 
I 
often used to tell her, and stamp my UMBERELLA , 
If with another I 
caught her, I'd from this world 
transport her, 
Her life should be much shorter than sun on a 
rainy 
day. 
I 
longed for her my wife to be. 
Through going to 
Paris, it wasn't to be ; 
For, when she sat on a 
Frenchman's knee, it wasn't 
the cheese for me, oh ! no ! 
The Cask of Gold; or, Claude in the Tower. 
Duval was never thrown in a 
more hazardous scrape than this.

CHORUS. 
Oh ! Sweet Isabella! her voice so sweet and mel-
low! 
I 
caught her with a 
fellow, then, with my UMBER-
ELLA, 
I 
fetched him such a 
smeller, and knocked him 
down the celler, 
Because she loved this fellow, and she would not 
belong to me. 
By Marcus's Paris excursion, to spend a 
week's 
diversion, 
I 
now make the assertion, I 
took Miss Isabella. 
She wanted no persuasion, but got up for the oc-
casion. 
We took ourselves from London-Bridge the Exhi-
bition to see. 
Scarce had we arrived 
in France, things went 
wrong, I 
saw at a 
glance, 
She was struck with men who could Parlez-vous 
France, and didn't care " that " for me, oh, no! 
Oh ! sweet Isabella! etc. 
The Exhibition compartments we view'd, then took 
apartments, 
The top-most-garret departments, the Royal Ho-
tel Victoria. 
We dined off roasted puppy- dogs, snails, and beau-
tiful stewed frogs, 
And never knew what we had eat till we found them 
moving " here." 
She began to talk French to the Valet- de- Shot-1g— 
perhaps about me—she was talking so long, 
Running me down, as she could speak tile tongue, 
of French not a 
word could I 
say, oh ! no ! 
Oh! sweet Isabella! etc. 
Isabella I 
you couldn't resist her, just here she raised 
a 
blister, 
Osceola; or, The Red Fawn of the Flower Land. 
A perfect panorama of the Everglades and their dusky braves.

When once for hours I 
missed her, and knew the 
Frenchman kissed her. 
One day, she thought me sleeping; not me ! for I 
was pe epi 
And saw my foreign brother with his arms around 
her waist. 
My blood was up, then with one blow, down the 
celler steps I 
laid him low, 
When she, with her hands, soon let me know she 
loved him better than me, all ! yes ! 
Oh ! sweet Isabella! etc. 
My feelings I 
could not smother, I 
came back to 
my mother; 
She said, George, try another, as they love one an-
. 
other ! 
In Fame° they soon got married, in France they 
never tarried, 
But came to good old England, and opened a 
Rasp-
berry- shop. 
So, if ever a Raspberry-ice you get, I 
hope, poor 
me ! you won't forget 
how the Frenchman my poor life upset, who lives 
in the White- Chapel- road, oh ! dear ! 
! 
sweet Isabella! I 
hope you'll leave the fellow 
With Ins Raspberry-ice so mellow, but with this 
umberella 
I 
could give him another smeller, and send him 
down the cellar, 
Because she loves this fellow, and she won't belong 
to me ! 
Oh! sweet Isabella! etc. 
THE FLYING TRAPEZE. 
ONCE I was happy, but now I'm forlorn, 
Like an old coat that is tattered and torn, 
Left in this wide world to fret and to mourn; 
Betrayed by a 
maid in her teens.

The girl that I 
loved, she was handsome : 
I 
tried all I 
knew her to please ; 
But I 
could not please her one quarter so well 
Like that man upon the trapeze. 
CHORUS 
He'd fly through the air with the greatest of ease, 
A 
daring young man on the flying trapeze ; 
His movements were graceful—all girls he could 
please, 
And my love he purloined away. 
This young man by name was Signor Bona Slang; 
Tall, big and handsome, as well made as Chang ; 
Where'er he appeared, the hall loudly rang 
With ovation from all people there. 
He'd smile from the bar on the people below ; 
And, one night, he smiled on my love; 
She winked back at him, and she shouted Bravo! 
As he hung by his nose up above. 
He'd fly, etc. 
Her father and mother were both on my side, 
And very hard tried to make her my own bride : 
Her father he sighed, and her mother she cried, 
To see her throw herself away. 
'Twas all no avail: she went there every night, 
And would throw him bouquets on the stage, 
Which caused him to meet her: how he ran me 
down, 
To tell you would take a 
whole page. 
He'd fly, etc. 
One night I, as usual, went to her dear bomb, 
Found there her mother and father alone ; 
I 
asked for my love, and soon they made known, 
To my horror, that she'd run away I 
She'd packed up her box and eloped in the night, 
With him, with the greatest of ease: 
The Woodrangers; or, The Trappers of Senora. 
Redolent of the wild forest and its wild and roving denizens.

From tWo stories high he had lowered her down 
To the ground, on his flying trapeze ! 
He'd fly, etc. 
Some months after this, I 
went to a 
hall, 
Was greatly surprised to see, on the wall, 
A 
bill in read letters, which did my heart gall, 
That she was appearing with him ! 
He taught her gymnastics, and dressed her in tights, 
To help him to live at his ease, 
And made her assume a 
masculine name ! 
And now she goes on the trapeze ! 
CHORUS. 
She floats through the air with the greatest of ease, 
You'd think her a 
man on the flying trapeze. 
She does all the work, while he takes his ease 
And that's what's become of my love! 
RIP VAN WINKLE. 
A MEDLEY. 
Ant—" Mynheer Van Dunk." 
IN 
the land of Van Dunk, where they often got 
drunk, 
Lived Rip Van Winkle, the Dutchman : 
He was one of those chaps, who thought of strong 
" 
schnapps," 
lie never could have too much, man— 
He never could drink too much, man, 
Saying, " No teetotaller stuff for me! 
Nor Cruikshank do I 
want to see, 
Or J. B. Gough—not he."

Am—" John Jones." 
One night Rip had been to.a 
sing-song society, 
And thought going home not an act of propriety, 
In schnapps and strong " weed" his last coin he'd 
squandered, 
And on to the famed Kaatskill Mountains he wan-
dered. 
There, a 
pirate crew w;•,re carousing and drinking ; 
Cried the captain to Rip, at his band slyly wink-
ing— 
' 
All hail ! Rip Van Winkle ! you're welcome be-
fore us ; 
Take a glass, arid we'll sing 
Jolly Dogs,' all in 
chorus ; 
Slap- bang, join us, our devilry- revelry, 
Swallow atis liquor till break of the day ! 
Ant—" German Band." 
These bucaneers were ghosts, whose ship 
had long gone to the bottom ; 
They knew, with grog that lushy Rip, 
For a 
victim they had got him. 
He with the spectres skittles played, 
And schnapps eager devoured, 
Till down upon the ground he laid, 
With drinking overpowered. 
He loved drink, and had always been 
The lashiest one in the land ; 
And he fancied the liquor the skipper handed him, 
In the middle of the phantom band. 
Ai—" 
Wonderful Crocodile." 
Along I'll skip, to say that Rip, 
When he woke from his slumber, 
Thought ' twas next day, but passed away 
Had twenty years in number. 
His hair was gray, he d 
fallen away— 
His clothes were rags about him ;

When he come down, and neared the town, 
The Dutchmen all did scout him.

He proved a 
most unlucky chap, 
And learnt, when he reached the town, 
His wife had married another man, 
To whom he owed half a-crown. 
She'd started a 
mangle, and he beard, 
To borrow five pounds, she'd been, 
Of a 
swindling loan society, 
To purchase a 
sewing- machine. 
Oh, it nearly broke his heart, 
And he wished he never had seen 
Them pirate chaps, with their fiery schnapps, 
And that never to sleep he'd been. 
Ant—" Roving Gardener." 
For everything was changed, and so different ar-
ranged, 
That Rip Van Winkle was quite puzzled ; 
OA 
the Kaatskill Mountains' steep, twenty years 
he'd been asleep, 
Thro' the magic potations he had guzzled. . 
OA, yes 
and he was changed as well; 
For him there was no friendly greeting; 
And in a 
week he died, thro' committing suicide, 
By joining of a 
teetotal meeting.

fancy you, 
In history have gained another " wrinkle," 
In the story I 
have told, the legend, strange and old, 
Of' the lushington Dutchman, Rip Van Winkle !

Just listen, if you've time to spare, 
While I 
rehearse a 
ditty; 
And for an opportunity, 
Conceive yourselves quite lucky, 
For tis not often here you see 
A 
hunter from Kentucky. 
Oh, Kentucky ! the hunters of Kentucky, 
. 
The hunters of Kentucky. 
We are a 
hardy, free-born race, 
Each man to fear a 
stranger; 
Whate'er the game, we join in chase, 
Despising toil and danger ; 
And if a 
daring foe annoys, 
Whate'er his strength and forces, 
We'll show him that Kentucky boys 
Are " alligator horses." 
Oh! Kentucky, etc. 
s'pose you've read it in the prints, 
how Pakenham attempted 
To make old Hickory Jackson wince, 
But soon his schemes repented; 
For we with rifles ready cock'd 
Thought such occasion lucky, 
And soon around the general flock'd. 
The hunters of Kentucky. 
Oh ! Kentucky, etc. 
You've heard, I 
s'pose, how New Orleans 
Is fam'd for wealth and beauty— 
There's girls of every hue it seems, 
From snowy white to sooty. 
So Pakenham he made his brags, 
If he in fight was lucky, 
he'd have their girls and cotton bags, 
In spite of old Kentucky.

But Jackson he was wide awake, 
And wasn't scar'd at trifles, 
For well he knew what aim we take 
With our Kentucky rifles ; 
So he led us down to Cypress Swamp, 
The ground was low and mucky, 
There stood John Bull in martial pomp, 
And here was old Kentucky. 
Oh! Kentucky, etc. 
A 
bank was raised to save our breast, 
Not that we thought of dying, 
But that we always like to rest, 
Unless the game is flying; 
Behind it stood our little force--
None wisli'd it to be greater, 
For every man was half a 
horse, 
And half an alligator. 
Oh! Kentucky, etc. 
They did not let our patience tire 
Before they show'd their faces— 
We did not choose to waste our flre-,. 
So snugly kept our places ; 
But when so near to see them wink, 
We thought it time to stop ' em ; 
And %would have done you good I 
think 
To see Kentuckians drop ' em. 
Oh! Kentucky, etc. 
They found at last 'was vain to fight 
Where lead was all their booty ; 
And so they wisely took to flight, 
And left us all our beauty. 
And now if danger e

And we'll protect you ladies.

TILL GE:MEN-EYED KONSLtat. 
A 
HANDSOME young woman was married one day, 
With a 
hey, ho, hy diddle diddle. 
Her husband a 
tiddler was, so they say, 
You could here him practise at home all day ; 
And from home many hours he would be away, 
For all night long he'd play at the play 
A very tine tune on the fiddle. 
A good-looking policeman was there, you must 
know, 
With his long coat, staff, and his rattle ; 
And says he, " I 
should like for to come for to go 
The fiddler's wife my bull's-eye to show, 
And to tell her the wind out my light did blow, 
And see if she's got any cold meat you know, 
For that's the stuff I 
could tackle." 
So into the house he went off his beat, 
Did this hungry button'd-up glutton, 
And the fiddler's wife did greet. 
Say's he, " It's some time since I've been in this 
street, 
have you got such a 
thing :IS a 
bit of cold meat'?" 
And down by the tire he then took a 
seat, 
And she gave hail a 
lump of cold mutton. 
Says he, " Dearest creature, this mutton's divine, 
But I 
should like to wet my old throttle ; 
I'd a 
herring for breakfast, it was salt as brine, 
It's regularly parch'd up this gullet of mine." 
So she went to the cupboard and brought in some 
wine.. 
And the bobby's eyes glisten'd and brightly did 
shine, 
As he eagerly collar'd the bottle. 
Every Lady her own Shoemaker. 
By this valuable treatise any lady can make neat shoes.

Say's he, " Dearest angel, you are kind to me, 
And I 
love you the same as a 
brother ; 
I 
wish from the fiddler you only was free, 
For all night long I 
am dreaming of thee." 
And the fiddler popp'd in, and there he did sea 
His wife sitting down on the policeman's right knee : 
Oh, crikey ! then there was a 
bother. 
The poor old fiddler with rage did cry, 
" 
I 
thought you did only me cherish," 
And the wifa spoke up and said, " Ill tell you for 
why, 
He only came in to light up his bull's-eye." 
But the fiddler said ' twas a 
villainous lie, • 
" 
You may fiddle he but you don't fiddle I, 
For all of us here shall perish." 
Now the poor old fiddler was sadly cut up, 
To be robb'd of his bride and his glory, 
So he han,g'd himself with a 
piece of cat-gut, 
And the policeman his throat v 
ith his staff did cut. 
And as for her, the wicked young slut, 
She drown'd herself in the water butt ; 
So there's an end to my story.

And the crown and the pound were baith for me.

was both happy, gay and jolly, 
Always free from night till morn, 
Now I

Since Rose left me all forlorn. 
She was such a

She's faultless in form, and lovely in each feature, 
But I

Oh, deer, I

Life a

Never gay, but always melancholy, 
Since my Rose deserted me. 
She is young and really very fair, too, 
Such a 
beauty upon my life, 
But she's gone, I 
cannot say where to, 
Doubtless to be another man's wife. 
She dances, sings, and likewise plays the harp well, 
Such genius you never saw before; 
In fact, she's quite " au fait" in everything, sirs, 
Her loss I 
deeply now do deplore ( deplore). 
Oft we sat quite cosy in the kitchen, 
And I 
thought she'd be true to me; 
I 
spoke of love, which she said wtts so bewitching, 
And promised her ne'er to want a 
latch-key.

And the baron's retainers were blithe and gay, 
And keeping their Christmas holiday.

His beautiful child young, Level's bride; 
While she, with her bright eyes, seemed to be 
The star of that goodly company. 
Oh, the misletoe bough! 
"I'm weary of dancing now," she cried, 
" 
Here, tarry a 
moment„ I'll hide—Ill hide ; 
And, Level, be sure thouirt the first to trace 
The clue to my secret lurking-place." 
Away she ran, and her friends began 
Each tower to search and each nook to scan; 
And young Lovel cried, " Oh ! where dost thou 
hide'? 
I'm lonely without thee, my own dear bride."

Was found in the castle—they raised the lid— 
And a

THE PATENT HAIR-BRUSIIING MACHINE.

I WAS once a 
stylish hair-dresser, and about six 
months ago 
I 
kept a 
small establishment, not far from here, you

But I 
never shall forget, how I 
was done so clear, 
While dressing the hair of a 
girl so fair, with the 
patent hair-brushing machine. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! I 
really thought she was the fairest that ever 
I'd seen, 
As she sat on the chair while I 
brushed her hair, 
with the patent hair-brushing machine.

It was seldom I 
was patronized by such a 
dashing 
belle, 
When she came in how my heart did beat, I'm sure 
you cannot tell; 
I 
felt all over alike— in love I 
must have been, 
For this charming young dear made me feel so 
queer, when I 
used the hair-brushing machine. 
She wore a 
handsome blue silk dress, her shawl was 
made of lace, 
her lovely hair hung down her back with such an 
air of grace; 
She really looked divine, her equal I 
never had seen, 
I 
was filled with delight, could have work'd all 
night, at the patent hair-brushing machine. 
She gave me such a 
wicked smile, that gave my 
heart a 
twist, 
I 
took her gently round the waist, and her I 
gently 
kissed; 
She started from the chair, and lor ! how she did 
scream— 
Oh ! you villain, said she, and then whack'd into 
me with the patent hair-brushing machine. 
Then all at once a 
swell rushed in, a 
pal of hers no 
doubt, 
With his stick he knocked me down, then turned 
the place near inside out; 
They took my watch and chain, my cash box emp-
tied clean, 
And to my dismay they had bolted away, with my 
patent hair-brushing machine, 
I 
soon procured an M. P., and in search of them 
we went, 
I

FOOLED IN A

Vother day : 
I 
got into a

lady dress'd so slap, 
She was nursing of an infant that was crying out 
for pap. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, she was a 
charming creature for 
she had such— 
A 
black and a 
rolling eye, she wore a new poke 
bonnet, 
A 
nice little young thing, and just the one to woo. 
I 
said, " What a 
handsome baby !" and the lady 
on me smil'd ; 
I 
said, " T 
would malle a

f 
ther of such a 
child."

never shall forget that look, you 
Call imagine a 
loving look from such an angel with 
A

" 
Would you have any objection to take this baby 
on your knee 1 
I 
have to get out at this station just to speak a 
word 
to a 
friend." 
I 
said, " I 
would with ple“sure," and down the 
stairs she did descend. 
SPOKEN.—And as she did she gave me another 
loving look with— 
A 
black and a 
rolling eye, etc. 
In less than half a 
minute the train was off nein, 
I 
looked and called for the lady, but .citil 1 
cud in 
vain, 
We got to another station when to the porter I 
did 
shout, 
I 
say, be quick and open the door and let me and 
the baby out." 
SPOKEN.—And the first thing I 
did was to look 
about 
the 
carriages, but no mother for 
baby 
could I 
find, so the Conductor said, " You had bet-
ter go to the Station- master, and inform him of the 
circumstance." 
I 
did, and the Station-master said, 
just give me a 
description of the lady," so I 
told 
him— 
She'd a 
black and a 
rolling eye, etc.

had to 
say,

had cake enough 
already, and hard-bake as well, wheu one of the

Reckless what destiny might bring, 
Nought to my soul could give delight, 
Or ease the pain of disappointment's sting— 
Until a 
glorious light 
Shone on my desert way, 
Changing in 
spirit's night 
Into effulgent day-. 
Oh, blessed was that light, 
It raised me from despair; 
But yet so wondrous bright, 
its beams I 
scarce could bear. 
Star like it shone, 
Far, far above my head, 
Bidding my grief begone, 
Yet filling me with dread. 
I 
worshipped it with fevered brain, 
I 
knew such love might aye prove vain, 
And yet despite the torturing pain, 
I 
madly braved its power again. 
So rear was that light 
Which shone on my despair, 
I 
thourdit, though wondrous bright, 
To love it I 
might dare. 
Yes, fond hope whispered still to me, 
In spite of all she may be thine ; 
The humble lackey yet may be 
Destined with the great to shine. 
Thus love prevailed, and still I

cannot lose ;

it was the song my mother sang,

Were fraught with precepts old; 
And every line a 
maxim held, 
Of far more worth than gold ;

That cannot pass away— 
It is my guiding star by night, 
My comfort in the day.

To seek a 
solace there, 
Where only stricken hearts could find 
Meet answer to their prayer.

Whose words my tears beguiled ;

COME, DRAIN Lid.k1 WINE. 
Comn, drain the wine while evening brings 
To life's dull toil a 
welcome truce; 
Of all the joys the poet sings, 
None can beat the . vine's bright juice. 
To-day bath been a 
toilsome day, 
Care hath pressed this heart of mine, 
But I 
will drive my care away— 
Then fill the bowl—come drain the wine. 
AU that joyous nature knows 
Man too quickly far would grasp, 
So she keeps the blushing rose 
Hidden in the rosebud's clasp; 
But as ' twill burst poor nature's shield 
When the genial sun shall shine, 
So let care to pleasure yield ; 
Then fill the bowl—come drain the wine. 
Oh, what is life when clad with grief 
Da.y or night no pleasure bring— 
Alt, what is Lie when bright and brief 
'Tis life ! ' tis life ! ' tis everything ! 
Then bring us wine, and bring us dice, 
And if perchance ill luck be mine, 
I'll ask the goblet's good advice; 
Then fill the bowl—come drain the wine.

As he looks on the young and gay, 
And his grey head moving slow, 
Keeps time to the air hey play ;

Of what is the old man thinking 
As he leans on his oaken staff'? 
'Tis not with a

That the old man sheds a

'Tis not for his strength declining,

And the old man's eyes are dim, 
For it calls no a

From the dance and the merry laugh, 
Of their calm repose he is thinking,

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO, GIRLS, 
Ant—" What would you do, love ?" 
W HAT will you do, love 7 
they have been singing. 
In your ears ringing, this year or two; 
But what you should do, girl., it's my intention 
To politely mention, fair ones, to you : 
Tho' men deride us, they're seldom chiding 
Their own backsliding, you know that's true ; 
Now, I'll tell to you, in certain cases, 
And times and places what you should do. 
What & mould you do, girls, if a 
faithless lover 
You should discover a 
wild rover quite 7 
What, pine in sorrow 1—oh, no, to- morrow 
Get another one, and just serve him right. 
Tho' on Ids knees himself he's throwing, 
Let him be knowing it vihl not do, 
For your hand that he may whistle, 
Give him dismissal, that's what you do. 
What should you do, girls, if a 
cruel mother 
Makes you, for another, give your love up I 
Don't imitate foolish Vilikins and Dinah, 
Oh, no, decline a " cold poisOn" cup ; 
As fine good fish as e'er were caught in 
The sea, and brought in, there's still a 
few, 
So smile as lightly, look just as bricduly, 
And conic here brightly, that's what you do. 
What would you do girls, when a 
miser profters 
His hand, and cotters brimful of gold, 
With lean, spindled shanks, and sunken yellow 
Face, wrinkled, sallow, deformed and old, 
And you loved a 
poor man, say, would you suffer 
That rich old buffer to dazzle you 7 
Oh, no, fair girls, you'd act far wiser, 
And reject the miser—that's what you'd do.

EDMUND left his Ella dear,

_ . The Deotoo of the Desert. 
This book is one of the most powerfully 
exciting 
novels 
ever written. 
The 
scenes are laid in the land of the ride, 
the tomahawk and the scalping- knife, 
Terrible 
adventures crimson almost 
every page. 
Prairie Pete; Or, 
Tito 
Trapper's Avenger. 
Of all the tales of 
wild adventure hi forest and prairie 
this is the most excellent. The reader 
seems to actually hear the yell of the 
demon red- skins, 
sees 
their painted 
laces, and witnesses the lurid flames of 
the frontier log cabin. 
No. 3. Wild B11, the Indian. 
Slayfer. Wild Dill, who is an inveter-
ate hater of 
Indians.

walks out ot the house without a 
brace 
of fine revolvers slung to his waist, and 
woe to the Indians that cross his path. 
No. 4, The Death .Trail. 
Vividly 
are these pages filled with the doings of 
the 
terrible Regulators of Arkansas.

revenge upon her slayer, in the ruined 
, 
wigwam. 
No. 5. Grey- Eyed Lathe. 
livery 
page of tins thrilling book is full of in-
cident. 
The characters are natural, 
the actions life-like and full of daring. 
The hot sun of Sonora fills their veins 
and excites them to deeds of despera-
tion. No book of its class can begi.i to 
compare with it. 
No. 6. Si.e-Shooter Jim,. 
This 
book will find readers as long as there 
exists a 
taste for the wild, the terrible, 
and the sanguinary. It is a truthful 
picture of real life as it exists upon the 
frontiers where the revolver, meets the 
rile, the tomahawk and scalping knife. 
;7. The Wrecker's Victim. 
This Story is terribly interesting. The 
daughter of the i 
ron-hearted smuggler 
and the wrecker is one of the loveliest 
maidens that ever pressed foot on sea-
sand. 
Iler admirers were many among 
the ruffians that surround her—rullians 
more cruel than tInt awful waves 
hat 
dash on the wreck- strewn shore 
by 
which site lives. 
No. S. The Storm Child. The 
dark caverns that honey- comb the storm 
lashed shores of Cornwall witness tern' 
ble crimes in their recesses.

aye, and red-handed pirates, are the ac-
tors who seek by the fiercest means to 
perpetn,te terrible and unholy crimes.

*Noi..9, Captain Bob, the:Moun-
d 
r fain Devil. A 
few years ago there 
dwelt in the almost impenetrable reces-
ses of the Ozark Mountains, a 
wretch 
whose name was a 
terror to fhe inhabi-
tants of the surrounding region. With 
his band of outlaws, Indians and cut-
t 
hroats, he made raids upon the outlying 
plantations, plundered them, and, if op-
position were attempted, arson and mur. 
der were added to the other dark deeds. 
21'o. 10. Wild Bill's _First Trail. 
Is a 
plain recital of the first of the many 
adventures in which this daring Indian 
Fighter, Buffalo Router, Trapper and 
Union Guide, was an actor. The story 
is told by himself, and is very entertain 
sag. 
' 
No. 11. Sam Sutton, the Scalp 
Taker. In this bock figure many of 
the Indians who are now making the 
Great Plains a " dark and bloody 
ground." Sam will be readily recogniz-
ed as a 
real character by all our officers 
who have been stationed in the Indian 
country. 
No. 12. The Crawling Snake. 
'This famous Scout and Indian Scalper , 
went far ahead of the most cunning In-
dian in tricks and stratagems.

watched camp, and knife an Indian in 
the heart of his encampMent.

his blessing and his rifle. When he 
himself is attacked Big Lige comes to

steel—with a 
wit keen as his scalping-
knife. 
A love story runs its silTer 
cord through the blood-stained tissue. 
No. 15. Leatherskin; or, The 
Prairie Guide. This well-hnown Scout 
was an odd mixture of Kit Carson and 
Old Adams the grizzly-tamer; and 
could out- ride, out-shoot and out-fight 
the tallest red-skin that ever took a 
white man's scalp. 
No. 16. Black-Beard. This fero-
cious pirate, who seemed to love crime 
for its own sake, was one at the most 
skillful sailors that ever took his " trick 
at the helm;" and his terrible deeds are , 
listened to with a 
strange interest in the 
fo'castle, when the wind is " blowing 
great guns." 
No. 17. Adelaide, the Avenger ; 
- How a 
young, lovely and innocent girl, 
frdlowed the fortunes of a

the fearful storm, the fair girl follows 
the wretch like the figure of doom.

Trader. Cobb, Robinson and Ben-

vellously well told, and true to life.

Spectre of the Swamp. Fearfully inter-
