Thank you.  I am truly honored to be addressing this
 
particular assembly on this particular day.  You see,  I' m
 
neither an east  coast native nor an Asian American and I
 
originally came to Arlington just to do a six month piece of
 
work for the Smithsonian and then go home,  I never intended
 
to stay,  and it  still surprises me to think I' ve been here 21
 
years.  I guess at bottom I still  feel kind of temporary.
 
So it's very gratifying to be asked to address the city
 
and county workers of the place where  I' ve been living.  It
 
sort of brought up old memories and I hope you'll forgive me
 
for remarking that Arlington when I first  saw it back in 1975
 
wasn't really all that prepossessing.  Wilson Boulevard was
 
nearly impassable at that time because of Metro construction.
 
I remember every morning picking my way gingerly to the bus
 
stop,  skirting the piles of rubble,  teetering along planks
 
laid over open ditches,  noticing how most of the large
 
Clarendon stores had closed down and moved out,  their Wilson
 
Boulevard frontages taken over by small family-style store-
front businesses,  almost all of them Asian-American
 And I
 
kept on being pleased by that part because I had never lived
 
with many Asian Americans neighbors before.
 
But  I also kept on thinking that all those nice  little
 
restaurants and groceries and jewelry stores had probably
 
moved in  just because business was poor and so rents had
 
dropped and there were lots of vacancies.  And I thought.  well
 
they' re are going to do all right for a while and keep
 
business  flowing around here for a year or so until the Metro
 
finally opens up and everything is pretty again.  And then -
-
the rents will go back up,  the nice Asian-Americans and other
 
locally-owned small businesses won't be able to pay the
 
larger amounts and will have to move out,  and the bigger,
 
more standard businesses will take over again.  I' d seen it
 
happen with redevelopment many times before  in many places.
 
But,  do you know,  that really didn't happend here  in
 
Arlington,  at  least  from my perspective.  Twenty years  later I
 
can still visit many of the exact  same stores  I patronized in
 
1975.  and profit by the expert assistance of the craftsmen
 
and women who work in photography,  jewelry,  printing,
 
dressmaking,  retail sales.  I can still enjoy a fabulous
 
Vietnamese,  Japanese,  Chinese,  Indian meal  (along with my
 
chili and barbecue) .
 And just a few weeks ago I read in the
 
Washington Post that the Clarendon area has become "Cool
 
Clarendon -
-
 Adams Morgan with parking".
 
Something really good obviously happened here in
 
Arlington in those years and I think Arlingtonians ought to
 
feel pretty happy about it.  I don't know exactly how it all
 
worked -
-
 I expect a lot had to do with zoning regulations
 
and planning restrictions,  and I'll bet the various county
 
boards had some rough sessions during that period.  But  I do
 
know that  regulations and codes only work when the people,
 
the voting public,  fundamentally support them and
 
fundamentally believe  in them.  And most Americans also
 
believe in being fair,  and they believe that  small businesses
 
are as  important as big businesses,  sometimes more so.
 
And finally it' s also a very old American principle that
 
we  should welcome people who come new to this country and
 
value the  special gifts they always bring with them.  I' d call
 
our country
 "multicultural" if that word didn't  scare people
 
so much.  You know we' ve always have lived this way,  sharing
 
the  1an
 . ifferent  folks.  There never has been a time
 
when only one kind of people lived here;  even pre-history
 
shows different groups of indigenous tribes and settlements
 
occupying North America,  and those people themselves came
 
here across the Bering Straits or else up out of the ground
 
from the nether world as  some of their religious traditions
 
have it.  This continent,  this  stretch of land between the
 
Atlantic and the Pacific oceans,  has always been host to
 
travellers.
 
It  is discouraging that whenever things get a little
 
out of order and people try to figure out why,  some folks'
 
minds
 go on to automatic pilot and they begin to say,  "Well,
 
of course  it  isn't us making trouble,  we're too nice,  so it
 
must be those other folks over there that we don't know so
 
well -
-
 those newcomers,  those immigrants  (forgetting all the
 
time that every single person in the U.S.  has  immigrants
 
hanging all over their family trees.)
 
But,  do you know,  it's  just  like the zoning
 
regulations -
-
 if we didn't really underneath like living
 
with different kinds of people,  if we didn't  really approve
 
of letting people come here,  if we hadn't found there were
 
solid advantages to it,  we  just wouldn't have kept on doing
 
it.  So why not try ,for a change,to think about what  is  so
 
wonderful about  living in a multicultural nation,  since we' ve
 
got one and we always have had.
 
What have different peoples to offer each other,  what
 
have they to gain from each other across cultural barriers?
 
The  first thing is -
-
 the beauty of difference.  If everything
 
is the same,  why bother to look or listen or love? Difference
 
is essential to beauty.  The second thing is the reassurance
 
of similarity.  To feel comfortable,  to feel at ease and
 
approved of,  you need to have something in common.
 
The beauty of differences.  The assurance,  the comfort
 
of similarities.  Catch both of those together and you' ve got
 
a prize.  And really that  is why these celebratory months  like
 
the one we' re enjoying right now are so important  for
 
Americans -
-
 they give us a chance to focus on one group
 
after another of our diverse citizenry,  learning a bit about
 
each one,  and coming to rejoice  in the  similarities and
 
differences each one offers us.
 
Now this  is Asian-American month.  There is absolutely
 
no way that  in the next 3 and a half minutes  I can sum up for
 
you the contributions made by the great Asian peoples that
 
have come to this country.
 
A few things might  stick in your mind,  like recent
 
studies  show that Asians who have immigrated here,  far from
 
taking away jobs,  actually create new ones.  Did you know,  for
 
instance,  that  fifteen of the nation's most  successful high-
tech companies were founded by Chinese,  Filipino,  Indian and
 
other Asian and Pacific ethnic groups?
 This bunch of
 
companies now has a combined revenue of 22 and a quarter
 
billion dollars.  Asian Americans across the country pay out
 
three billion dollars a year in wages alone.  Asian Americans
 
engage with remarkable success  in our institutions of higher
 
learning and make contributions  in every scientific and
 
professional area.
 
But what  I' d really like to emphasize are the amazing
 
artistic contributions that Asian American immigrants have
 
brought with them.  At the National Endowment  for the Arts,  I
 
helped develop the Folk and Traditional Arts Program.  Its  job
 
was to honor,  strengthen and make visible those home grown
 
community-based art  forms that have endured through
 
generations,  that carry with them a sense of community
 
aesthetics and that  serve both to identify and to symbolize
 
the particular group that originated them.
 
Some of the art  forms we supported were informal -
-
 some
 
people would call them folk -
-
 and some were formal -
-
 some
 
people might call them "classical".  But all are traditional
 
to a special people.  Consider for instance,  Hawaiian hula,
 
Laotian weaving,  Japanese
 bonsai plantings,  Hmong
 
embroidered flower cloths,  Thai,  Japanese and Chinese silk,
 
Cambodian court dancing,  the varied instrumental ensembles of
 
Okinawa,  India,  Korea,  Balinese gong orchestras and shadow
 
puppets,  Chinese ceramics
 -
-
 I could go on for hours  just
 
listing the superb artistic creations we' re privileged not
 
just to look at  in museum exhibits and concert auditoria but
 
in the homes and shops of our neighbors who happen to have
 
come from these countries and have brought beloved pieces of
 
their homeland arts with them.
 
And we all have chances to learn to love them too.
 
That's what Asian-American week is for-- sharing and being
 
shared with -
-
 and we will shortly be enjoying some
 
performances from our neighbors and our neighbors'  children
 
from countries many of us may never see.  But we have a piece
 
of them right here!)
 And we will,  I predict,  see and hear
 
some sights and sounds that will be brand new to us.  But
 
remember  just one thing more:  nobody was born loving
 
Beethoven or Picasso or Johnny Cash or Greek columns or log
 
cabin quilts or rap music.  As Rogers and Hammerstein said in
 
a song about  learning to hate,  "You have to be carefully
 
taught".  And so it  is with appreciation and love -
-
 it
 
doesn't come inborn,  it comes  from experience,  from exposure,
 
from taking a class or two,  from listening and looking,  from
 
reading a book,  from talking with other people.
 
It  is my hope that the Asian American month of 1996 will
 
send us all not  just out to dinner in one of our delightfully
 
savory Asian American restaurants but to added experiences  in
 
the many kinds of beauty that Asian Americans have brought
 
into the United States.  Every one of us can  join in this -
-
even if we' re Asian ourselves,  after all,  we can learn more
 
about other kinds of Asian arts than our own.  And wouldn't
 
that be a happy beginning for us all,  as well as a happy
 
ending for my speech.
 
Thank you again for inviting me.
