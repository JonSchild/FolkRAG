DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away, 
But, my darling, you will be, will be--
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes, my darling, you will be, 
Always young and fair to me. 
CHORUS. 
Darling, I 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold, 
Shine upon my brow to-day, 
Life is fading fast away— 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no ionger bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say, 
Oh ! my darling, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes, my darling, mine alone— 
You have never older grown! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old, 
Locks may lose their brown and gold; 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know, 
Never, never, winter's frost and chill; 
Summer warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I'm growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair, 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below; 
Since I 
kissed you, mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you, mine alone, 
You have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc.

BELLE, THE BEAUTIFUL BLONDE, 
W AYNE and LOVELY'S own original song and dance. 
Written 
expressly for them by BARRY CARTER. 
HOW lovely seems this world of ours, with something sweet to 
love, 
I've lately met with something sweet, and gentle as a 
dove ; 
I 
met her first one summer's eve, the stars shone bright and 
clear, 
While music floated on the winds in a 
park not far from here. 
CHORUS. 
My Belle she's a 
beautiful blonde, 
In a 
st,yle others try to excel, 
Yet there's none in this land can compare, 
With my darling, my beautiful Belle. 
Tier laugh is rippling melody so soft and sweet, 
Sym. 
With pretty little tapering hands and pretty feet, 
Sym. 
Beneath her dancing golden curls, 
Her eyes shone bright and clear, 
She's sweet, but better than she looks, 
My pretty little dear. 
By some one we were introduced ; some good old friend of 
mine; 
Her dress is faultless to a 
hair, I 
thought she was divine, 
So bewilderingly, so beautiful, this charmer fair did seem, 
Ever since that night this world to me seems an enchanted 
dream. 
My Belle, she's a 
beautiful blonde, etc. 
I've loved her well since first we met, she loves me just as 
well, 
And says I 
am divinely sweet, my darling blue-eyed Belle; 
But soon we'll wed and settle down, I 
must not tell that here, 
it won't be far from the gay sea-shore, when the dancing waves 
will hear, 
My Belle, she's a 
beautiful blonde, etc.

them, with tremendous success, throughout the United States. 
OH, my heart is filled with sweet angelic rapture, 
Of a 
beauty fair I 
met the other (lay, 
Whilst in the Central Park a 
promenading., 
List'ning to the band of music sweetly play 
Her pretty eyes with merry fun were dashing, 
Like clustering diamonds beneath her golden curls, 
Oh, my heart was gone the moment I 
beheld her, 
She's a 
queen when compared with other girls. 
cnoitus. 
She warbles sweeter than a 
bird. 
Such melody I 
never heard, 
She's a 
fairy, is my Laughing Lilly Lindon; 
And her royal beauty stole my heart away, 
Yet we often meet and wonder in the starlihgt, 
In the park to hear the band of music play. 
Sym. 
Sym. 
Now I'm longing for the happy times that's coming, 
When my Lilly dear and I 
are going to wed, 
You will find when to her I 
introduce you, 
That there's more than truth in every word I 
said ; 
in a 
tiny fairy cottage by a 
streamlet, 
We'll luxuriate like little turtle doves; 
I'll be more than happy when the wedding's over, 
For I'm the only darkie that she loves. 
She warbles sweeter than a 
bird, etc.

Talking is Silver and Silence Is Gold. 
Words and Melody by BURT W AYNE. 
MOTTO SOIVG. 
WE meet with many a 
man now days, 
In every laud and clime, 
Who expresses his opinion of man, 
Says lie's got them all down tine; 
Some men will argue black is white, 
Others care not ‘N 
hat is said, 
No doubt the gold shines, in this man, 
He has a 
still tongue in his head. 
We've read the works of our author's great, 
Shakspeare's poems have been told, 
This adage is what all men want, 
Talking is silver and silence is gold. 
As we wander through our cit les, 
Curious, sights will meet our eyes, 
The expressions of roughs upon the corner, 
Excites your auger and surprise; 
We hear this, with a 
silent thought, 
There's no deference paid to style, 
We pass them by with an unheeding sigh' 
For hard words return a 
smile, 
Although some turn without a 
thought, 
And express themselves quite bold, 
While others proceed, and alway3 heed, 
Talking is silver and silence is gold. 
You may see a 
poorly tressed woman, 
Getting into a 
crowded street car, 
One would think that she was not human. 
Or had any business there; 
She'd been working all day, still that dDn't matter, 
Not one will offer a 
seat, 
Let a 
richly-ditesect lady at any time enter, 
A 
half dozen incr. IN ill spring to their feet. 
Thus you can jthige tie principle of man. 
Be he young or old. 
This adage here, is equally clear, 
Talking is silver and silence is gold.

And the fiddle join the chorus, while the darks all gaily sing,

PATCHOULA. 
LOVELY and fair is my darling Patchoula, 
With eyes tender blue as mid summer's sky; 
She is my 
jewel, my heart's fondest treasure, 
The bloom on her cheeks will the roses outvie. 
She treats coldly my passionate ardor, 
Oh! its then that I 
love her the harder, 
Though she says on her life she'll ne'er be my wife? 
Such a 
dear little witch is Patchoula. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! beautiful, bewitching Patchoula, 
My dear little riddle Patchoula, 
She can fool me at will but I'll think of her still. 
My witching, my darling Patchoula. 
When I 
first saw Patchoula one bright summer morning 
She stood by the side of her own father's gate, 
The smile that she gave me had the spell of a 
charmer; 
'Twas then that I 
knew I 
had met all my fate, 
With her manners so bewitching and simple, 
Her cheeks are so roguish and dimpled; 
'What care I 
for life if she'd by my wife, 
Illy own little darling Patchoula. 
Oh! beautiful, &c.

Think I

love, 
A 
sliding over there. 
Come and kiss me, &c.

MY SUGAR PLUM, 
Words and Music by THOMAS M . 
H ICNOLES, 
I 
AM over head and ears in love, 
The truth I 
tell, with a 
turtle dove; 
She ought to be in the skies above, 
An angel she should be. 
Her laughing eyes, with a 
dimpled chin, 
Her face so white and fair: 
Her look so neat and so complete, 
With a mass of silk like hair—oh I 
Ctionus. 
irettily she dances on her little toes, 
Looks as neat and sweet as a 
little tube rose; 
Charms all the people as up the street she goes, 
She's my sugar plum. 
This lucious little sugar plum 
Was introduced to the one you see. 
At a 
masked ball, where I 
had such fun, 
Everyone was in full glee; 
Thisj oyous night my heart felt light. 
With gleams of future bliss— 
When parting at the dawn of day, 
I 
was rapt in happiness—oh! 
Prettily she dances, Zee.

DELEHANTr. 
IN an Ivy-covered cottage, 
Hidden back of oaken trees, 
Lives a 
lovely little maiden, 
Blythe and happy as you please. 
Where upon a 
low veranda, 
Every summer's eventide, 
I 
sit amid the flowers fair 
Camillia by my side. 
CIIORUM. 
All among the roses, 
Making sweet proposes— 
Lovely, laughing, soul bewitching, 
Sweet Camillia May; 
Captivating, aggravating, 
Never tired of play— 
Flitting like a 
little birdie, 
Happy, light and gay; 
Kill me or I'll die with love 
For sweet, Camillia May.

In the voice of Milly May. 
All among, ite,-
Now forget not to remember, 
When in love you chance to be, 
Try and keep in all your feelings 
Not act foolishly like me; 
For I 
live on, hoping, dreaming, 
Of a 
coming joyous day, 
When I'll make of one Camillia 
Such a 
lovely sweet bouquet. 
All among, 
A 
Written and Composed by JosErn P. SIKELLE. 
Arranged by R. 
STEIRLY. 
THERE is no place so gay as the hall-room, 
When we're dancing in dreamy delight, 
When the cares of the day never greet us, 
In the flush of the beautiful night, 
But the dawn puts an end to our glory, 
And the pleasure we dearly adore, 
We must part from the scene so enchanting, 
And go home looking sleepy and sore. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, we all know there is nothing more delightful 
than to go to a 
ball, and dance all night with a 
pretty girl, and 
eat expensive suppers, and flirt a 
little in a 
qu:et corner, and 
all that you know; but when reflecting on it the next day, one 
eLn't help but think, 
CHORUS. 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, 
And the pleasure we love to recall, 
But you know how we feel in the morning, 
Coming home, coming home from the ball. 
There the ladies are rivals of Venus, 
And their smiles all around us bestow, 
Ev'ry face wears a 
mantle of gladness, 
There is welcome where ever we go; 
"'-
30 
But when morning comes round we are weary, 
And we growl at the pain in our heads, 
And we thint we were foolish for dancing, 
Wnen we should have been home in our beds. 
SPOKEN.—That is just how it is. 
It's all very fine while It 
lasts, but we have to pay for it in the end. 
One will say, " Oh, 
my, I'm so sleepy." 
Some body else will yawn out very loud, 
"Dear me, I 
wish I 
was home." 
Another will complain of 
being chilly, and so on. 
And when we contemplate all this we 
naturally say to ourselves, 
Oh it's all very well to be waltzing, etc, 
All around us the music is floating, 
Light and gay as the bird's happy song, 
And we sigh when the last note is over, 
Tho' we know we've been dancing too long; 
We are lost in the gladness around us, 
And we heed not the hours as they fly, 
Till the light peeping in thro' the window, 
Makes us all bid each other good-bye. 
SPOKEN.— Yes, we must all say good-bye at last, while we 
sympathize with each other in our misery: and go home shiver-
ing in the morning air. 
On the way we all join together and 
give vent to our feelings thus— 
Oh it's all (wry well to go waltzing, etc.

HARDING, 238 Bowery, New York. 
I 
TOOK my love one evening 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' the silent arbors gleaming, 
Where Cupid has control. 
I 
wanted to tell her, 
flow dearly I 
adored her; 
But Oh ! she would not listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly hriplor'd her, 
Oh! love, oh! love, why don't you heed me, 
flow can you treat me so, 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turn'd away her head, 
And this was all she said. 
Oh! aint you awful, 
It's wrong you know, to love me SO., 
Yes you are awful, 
Your like I 
ne'er did see; 
Oh! ain't you awful, 
It's wrong you know to love me so, 
Dear me you're horrid, 
Why don't you let me be. 
32 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said ra like to see her, 
Say yes and ease my mind, 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And Lughed at my attention; 
She said mamma wou1.1 scold her, 
If such things she dared to mention, 
Come love I 
cried we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind, 
Oh no, oh no, she said, 
Don't ask me now to wed, 
What would the people say, 
If we should run away? 
Oh! ain't you awful, &e, 
She tailed on useless matters. 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
Whe.1 silent she should be, 
I 
begg'd her to listen, 
And drew her close beside me; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
smile 
That she did not care for me, 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not my pain. 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said. 
Oh, aint you awful, ..tc.)

OH ! my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn, 
A 
darling face has won nw. 
Such a 
lovely girl, with teeth of pearl, 
I 
met down by the brook, 
She is the prettiest, and the wittiest, 
Her smile has quite undone me, 
I'm her only beau, she told me so, 
When first my arm she took, 
She's as pretty as a

And her voice is just the cage, where the little birds are 
singing, 
She's the sweetest, and the neatest, 
She's as pretty as a

Oh, my heart is gone, and I'm forlorn,

An angel without wings. 
When ' twas time to go, we talked so slow, 
The roses scarce could hear us, 
Then my heart in sport, ' twas cupid's caught, 
Like fishes near the shore, 
When I 
loved her so, as I 
turned to go. 
She fondly lingered near me, 
And she dropped her head, and sweetly said, 
I 
wish you au-revoir, 
She's as pretty as a 
picture, 
And my heart is a 
golden frame, whenever you may find 
her, 
She's a 
fairy blithe and airy, 
She's as pretty as a

! 
very fond of roving 
When the stars are 1

the sky ; 
And a 
heart so true and loving 
Often meets me on the sly. 
The sweetest words he whispers, 
And his eyes are sparkling blue ; 
But what he tells, you may be sure, 
I'll never tell to you. 
Oh! we wander while the shadows fall, 
But a 
pair of eyes are my light; 
Of all the joys it beats them all, 
This flirting in the twilight. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! my heart kept going pit-i-pat, 
I 
scarce could tell what I 
was ; 
We wandered in the shadows, 
But his beaming eyes they were my light. 
Of joys we meet, there's none so sweet 
As flirting in the twilight. 
(Symphqtty, when, dunce i8 omitted) 
Now he called me " pet " and " dearest." 
And I 
could not tell you half! 
And he said I 
was the " nearest" 
Then I 
laughed a 
little laugh!

His arm he kindly offered, 
Then he offered me his hand, 
And said, he'd make his darling one 
The happiest in the land ! 
Tho' twas darkness in the pleasant air, 
Yet his beaming eyes were my light 
He kissed me—ere I 
was aware— 
While flirting in the twilight! 
Oh my heart, &v. 
Now I 
never can forget him, 
Nor his dear, enticing way! 
Near the place where I 
have met hire

My heart is in his keeping, 
He has stolen that I 
know, 
He really makes a 
very sweet 
And fascinating beau! 
So we wander in the darknesS yet, 
But his charming eyes are my light! 
My heart was caught in Cupid's net

CHARMING MRS. THOMPSON. 
As sung by the For SISTERS. 
M RS. THOMPSON. 
WHY does my husband leave me, 
And with false words deceive me, 
Why does his absence grieve me, 
When from home he stays away 
My feelings I 
cannot smother, 
My 
grief tell to another, 
There's nought but strife and bother, 
When from home he stays away. 
—Since our wedding, there has been no animosity 
on either side. 
Mr. Thompson, my husband, will provoke 
rue by saying he is my lord and master. 
Whoever made this 
man my lord and master ? I 
suppose it must have been the 
parson and that little word " Yes." Now I 
have a 
good mind 
to say " Yes" no more, and to say " No," instead. 
What a 
curious little word this is; it draws my lips together ( looks 
into a 
looking glass). 
No- o- o-o ! oh, how it puts my mouth 
out of shape; but nevertheless I 
shall give it a 
trial and try to 
cure him of his j 
-alousy. 
Oh, there he comes; now gentle-
men, please don't look at me, he's awfully jealous. 
(She leaves. 
M R. THOmPSON enters.) (HE 
Sings.) 
Oh, I've got a 
teasing wife, 
Full of trouble full of strife, 
She plagues me every hour of my life, 
Perplexing Mistress Thompson; 
No matter how I 
try to pleas; 
I 
never get a 
moment's ease, 
I 
wish her tongue from noise would cease 
Charming Mistress Thompson.

WRECK OF THE ATLANTIC. 
Oopyright Secure!. 
Written. Composed and Sung with great Success, by T.NfAxwELL. 
I 
AM going to say a 
word of the shipwreck that occurred 
On board the Steamship Atlantic, which no doubt you all have 
heard. 
It is fearful for to tell, of the sorrows that befell 
That ill-fated vessel, and the passengers as well. 
For they danced with:, right good glee—every night when on 
the sea; 
Never dreaming for a 
moment but safe-landed they would be. 
For they all joined together in making fun and mirth; 
To make the voyage pleasanter across the raging surf. 
On the 20th of March, they sailed away from Liverpool, so 
bright, 
With joyful hearts the 
salleC. aiong„ till land was far from 
sight. 
Thinking of friends they loved so dear, and the welcome when 
arrived, 
But alas! for them it was not to be; of their hopes they were 
deprived; 
For on the first of April morn, whilst to Halifax being borne, 
This pale vessel struck a 
rock just before the daylight's dawn. 
Then Captain Williams said: " Lower the boats! save the pass-
engers and crew ;" 
But the ship keeled o'er so suddenly that they had no time to do. 
In lass time than it takes to tell, the Atlantic was a 
wreck: 
The passengers startled from their sleep rushed out upon the 
deck.

Put on the face of everyone of them was a 
picture of dismay. 
And the survivors say they will ne'er forget the cries they heard 
that, day. 
It was then brave officer Brady, with a 
rope around his waist, 
Plunged off the ship into the sea, and to the rock made haste. 
To fasten the rope unto the rock was this brave man's plan, 
When from ship to the island rock through the raging waters 
swam. 
It is hard to thinl- not, a 
woman or child, was saved that dread • 
fill night; 
Put all were consigned to a 
watery grave whilst land was in 
their sight. 
For the water rushed into their berths. drowned them just as 
they were, 
Knelt praying to the Almighty God for him their lives to spare. 
It was hard to perish, and land so near; scarcely three hundred 
yards away. 
Some of them managed to get on deck, but wore quickly swept 
away. 
It was then the cry that, rent the air so very wild and high, 
To God they all resigned their souls, when they knew that 
they must die. 
The scenes of that wreck no one but, the survivors can relate, 
Some with despair like demons were, and some did calmly wait, 
When the fishermen came to their aid, and rowed all alive to 
land; 
Though some were penniless yet proud, when on the ground 
did stand. 
Then they took their last look at the place where they lost their 
friends so dear, 
And consigned them to their resting place that they had been 
so near. 
So let this be a 
prayer for all, wherever you may be 
Oh, God; look down upon them all who now lie in the sea.

BILL SMITHER .
S, 
Banjo solo by ED. HARRIGAN, sung by HARRY STAN WOOD. 
OLD Bill Smithers was a 
masher, 
He lost his teeth from chewing gum. 
He was head centre in a 
caravan circus, 
He manipttlated the big base drum. 
He'd a 
pair of teet like a 
canal boat's rudder, 
His lip hung down like a 
policeman's jaw, 
He'd a 
set of teeth like an alligator, 
They'd cut through hash like an old rip saw. 
Big Dutch doughnuts with Havana wrappers, 
Sleep quiet boys with your window up, 
Assassinate a 
ten cent barber, 
Drink hair oil from a 
custard cup. 
Bill Smithers went 'across to Jersey, 
Lived on gravel and Newark cheese, 
He put his money in his mother-in-law's pocket, 
He got out a 
patent for raising fleas, 
He spoke fifteen different kinds of language, 
He could stick out his tongue like an elephant's tail. 
He could cross the ferry without a 
ticket, 
His boarding house was in a 
jail. 
Blow your fingers on cold mornings, 
Go and buy a 
pair of socks, 
Never wear a 
linen duster, 
Keep your beaver in a 
box. 
Biltiteier was known to play casino, 
He carried sand in a 
public school. 
He slid off a 
roof and fell in a 
sewer, 
Caught the eperzooty from a 
mule. 
He was eat by jes in the month of August, 
Embalirie'd himself in a 
barrel of lard, 
Joined Buffalo Bill on the western prairie, 
And enlisted in the Mulligan Guard. 
Put suspenders on yon i 
trousers, 
Always sleep at the foot of the'bek 
Pay yoirr house rent when you move out, 
Make you sinkers out of lead.

SONG AND DANCE. 
OH, ain't it nice on Wednesday eve, 
The time when lovers meet, 
To have your girl lean on 3 
our arm, 
Oh, my! ain't it a 
treat. 
Just once a 
week a 
call I 
make, 
To see my little one, 
She's just as sweet to me as cake 
Or a 
dainty sugar plum. 
I am keeping steady, steady company, 
Where there is lots of fun, yes, lots of fun for vie, 
I 
visit Jane on Wednesday eve, 
Just when the clock strikes nine, 
Now really, folks, I 
do believe 
:Some day she will be mine. 
Her folks have no objection 
To my calling at the house, 
For I'm high in their affections, 
Just as innocent as a 
mouse. 
Jane blushes, too, all over her face, 
When I 
kiss her at the door, 
In all her blush and smile I 
trace, 
A 
lingering wish for more. 
I 
am keeping, ete. 
Now, young men, all just bear in mind, 
Some charmer you must get; 
Sortie nice young damsel you must find, 
That you can call your pet. 
And call on her just once a 
week, 
You can do it if you try, 
With kisses one and other greet, 
The same as Jane. and I. -

ONCE did love a 
yaller gal, whose name was Susy Brown, 
She came from Alabama, and was the fairest in the town ; 
ner eyes so bright that they shine at night. 
When the moon has gone away: 
She used to call this nigger up, 
Just afore the broke of day. 
With a " Who chit, who dat, who dat. who dat knocking at the 
door."

She was the handsomest gal dat eber I 
did see; 
SLe neber went out walkin' with any colored man but me, 
I 
took my banjo to the house, to play three times or more, 
When I 
heard two or three knocks pretty hard, 
Come bang, ag'in the door.

OH, here we are a

And were out on a 
bit of a 
spree; 
We ain't very parcicular about the style of our rigs, 
As you can undoubtedly see. 
So girls, open your eyes, and go in for a

Now here's a

For such gay darks you never can find, 
As gay Tom and Jerry, the twins. 
CHORUS. 
For so gayly we feel, [Sims.] 
From our head to our heel. 
Such gay colored darks you never can find, 
As gay Tom and Jerry, the twins. 
'Way in our Southern home we'd oft' in trouble be, 
They could'nt tell him from me; 
We're both very sharp and we're out for a

And we're gwine to join the jubilee. 
So look at our feet, don't you think them a

They are matched together like pins: 
We are handsome. 
and gay, so the people all say, 
We are gay Tom and Jerry the twins.

TRUE friendship only is a

For selfishness, a

Self-interest alone prevails, 
From peasant to the Queen ;

And this you'll lind t:w only way,

Look out for thyself, take care of 
For nobody cares for thee. 
Election candidates declare, your inter

Elected their own interest 
They'll study first you'll find; 
And thus it is with all mankind,

And this you'll lind they ( to, 
Enrich themselves nor do they care, 
If they should ruin you.

BECAUSE I 
am a 
countryman. 
And a 
stranger in the city, 
All sorts of tricks they play on me, 
And think their actions witty; 
When I 
go out I 
turn about, 
And peculiar smiles I 
see, 
0 
aint he fresh I 
hear them shout, 
When they take a

SPOKEN.—I

No matter where

I 
don't like personal re

They strike deep into my sensitive breast and make 
me swear. I 
say, dem it, what does it mean ? and echo answers 
dem it, what does it mean ? 
The very day I 
arrived in this city 
I 
asked a 
man at the Grand Central Depot, if he knew where I 
could engage a 
nice furnished room. " Oh," says he, " you're 
after furnished rooms, eh ? Well sir, you're in the wrong neigh-
borhood. 
You don't belong here. 
Well sir, I 
suppose you'll

very peculiar way, 
CHORUS. 
Young renal), your'e too fresh, 
Young fellali, you're I 
oo fresh. 
It strikes me very forcibly, 
Young fellah, you're too freslt. 
One day last week I 
took a 
car, 
And a 
stranger sat beside me, 
Who stole my watch and pocket- book, 
Tho' to prove it he defied me; 
1 
went and saw a 
man of law, 
And I 
begged his best advice, 
My friend said he you're very fresh, 
Why you've just come off the ice. 
SPOKEN.- I 
thought that a very strange expression for a 
man of law. 
I 
told him he must certainly be mistaken, for I 
had 
never been on the ice in my life, " Oh yes, you have." says he, 
" 
metaphorically speaking you have, sir, you have been on the 
ice of innocence, you have lived in an atmosphere of arctic 
virtue free from the burning influence of metropolitan wicked 
ness." 
He wanted io convince me that I 
was an ice man I 
suppose, but as he could give me no satisfaction for the loss I 
sustained, I 
left him, and as I 
came down stairs I 
heard him 
say, 
Young renali, you're too fresh, etc 
I 
took my girl to Central Park, 
And while there I 
grew quite spooney, 
I 
asked if she'd marry me, 
Why says she you most be looney ; 
I 
told her no, it was not so, 
And I 
assure you I'm quite ,

You know I 
love you very much, 
Oh don't let me love in vain.
