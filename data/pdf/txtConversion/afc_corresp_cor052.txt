The WPA Writers' Project of Florida has been recording indigenous folklore in a project
sponsored jointly by the Library of Congress and the WPA. In connection with this project,
they have made a very interesting collection of photographs of the singers and their
surroundings. We can obtain for our Archive copies of these photographs if we furnish
them with the necessary photographic film and paper. I recommend that the Library accept
this proposal. The cost will be about $7.72.
