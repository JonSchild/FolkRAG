At a recent lunch with Herman Viola,  director of the Smith-
sonian Anthropological Archives and Alan Jabbour,  director
 
of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress,
 
it became clear that all three 
of our agencies were concerned
 
with a similar problem:
 how to increase access for Native
 
• their cultural materials
• 
-•  in various
 
federal repositories.
 The materials include:
 
indi-
cating
 
a.
 Sound cyllinder recordings deposited in the Smith-
sonian,  the Library of Congress and the National Archives.
 
only a limited number have been copied onto tape;  therefore
 
the music recorded  (most of it prior to 1920) is inaccessible
 
which collections
were in which archive.
 
b.
 Aluminum and acetate discs containing music and
 
recorded oral literature  (1930 - 1950 mostly).
 Again, these
 
holdings are scattered between the three institutions, with
 
the Library of Congress having the lion's share.
 Because
 
of their age and fragility,  there is an increasingly urgent
 
need to copy more of these recordings onto tape.
 I under-
stand that the sound archive at L.C. is three years behind
 
in their copying orders.
 Further,  because of staff shortages
 
at the Archive of American Folk Song, properly detailed
 
cataloguing has been impossible; since 1941,  they have only
 
been able for the most part to set up simple accessions
 
lists  (e.g. four hours of Kiowa and Cherokee music recorded

Alan Jabbour, Herman Viola and I have almost weekly confer-
ences with Native American tribal representatives who are
 
wandering around Washington looking for various items of
 
their cultural heritage entrusted to the federal government,
 
sometimes generations ago.
 None of us can give these people
 
a clear or complete answer to their legitimate questions.
 
Many of them represent small local tribal cultural archives
 
(a number of which were put up by HEW,  I believe);  they have
 
nothing to put in them.
 Typically,  they don't want their
 
things back;  they just want to buy copies of them,  in the
 
ease of tapes,  or to take photographs of them,  in the case
 
of physical objects.
 
The three of us feel that the place to start dealing with
 
this problem is with the musical materials.
 It seems to us
 
that a project to copy,  catalogue and thus make available
 
to tribal members and scholars alike the historical musical
 
materials of Native Americans would be an excellent start
 
on the kind of inter-agency cooperation that you have stressed.
 
I can see the following agencies actively involved in such
 
an undertaking:
 both the Arts and Humanities Endowments,  the
 
Library of Congress,  the Smithsonian Institution,  the National
 
Archives,  and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
 Each repository,
 
I would imagine, would need special funding in order to locate,
 
catalogue properly and copy their holdings;  the project could
 
be coordinated by either Endowment or the BIA and result in
 
the development of a master list or catalogue across all the
 
federal archival institutions.
 
An additional consideration is that many of the most important
 
collections of Indian cultural materials are in private or
 
state institutions.
 A well-publicized project of this kind
 
on the federal level would be a compelling model for such
 
institutions,  recalling to them their own responsibility to
 
provide more convenient access to these important artistic
 
materials.
 
I do not have the least idea how much this might cost;  it
 
is still in the talk stage.
 If you think the notion worth
 
pursuing,  I should be glad to investigate the problems and
 
needs further and provide you with additional information.
 
My impression is that it would mean serious money,  and that
 
probably a special approach to the Congress for funding would
 
be necessary.
 
An appropriate occasion for a preliminary discussion of this
 
issue might be the next meeting of the board of the American
 
Folklife Center at the Library of Congress on January 25.
 
As you know, you are a statutory member of that board,  as is
 
Livingston Biddle, page 3.
 
the Secretary of the Smithsonian and the Chairman of the
 
Humanities Endowment.
 Alan Jabbour tells me the new Sec-
retary of the BIA has  just been sworn in as a board member.
 
(The new chairman of the board, by the way,  is David Voight,
 
whom I believe you know.)
 Thus,  a preliminary approach to
 
the problem could be discussed at that meeting,  since most
 
of the principals,  or their deputies, will be present.

Dear Liv:
 
THE LIBRARIAN OF CONGRESS
 
W AS HI NGTON, D.C. 20540
 
June 24, 1980
 
Thank you for sharing with me, in your recent letter,
 
your thoughts about the importance of the Federal Cylinder Project.
 
You are quite right in saying that the Library of Congress should-
properly serve as the lead agency in this endeavor.
 At the same
 
time, as the project's title implies, it is "federal" in scope
 
and discharges cultural responsibilities we all share within the
 
federal government--bo 
ose agencies w ich own and have
 
curatorial responsibility for unique cylinder recordings of our
 
American Indian and folk cultural heritage, and those agencies
 
responsible for direct financial assistance to the cultural de-
velopment of the Nation.
 
We have recently compiled a fresh inventory of cylinder
 
recordings containing folk cultural materials in the holdings of
 
the Library, and I am enclosing a copy of it for your perusal.
 
Enclosed also is a sheaf of publicity items about the project; you
 
are quite right in saying that it has proved a popular project in
 
all quarters, from scholars to American Indian communities to the
 
public media.
 
I do appreciate your generous offer to assist in any way
 
you and your agency are able,  to insure that the Federal Cylinder
 
Project is completed.
 These unique recordings must be preserved by
 
careful duplication onto magnetic tape; but beyond that, we have a
 
responsibility to organize and catalog the recordings to make them 
more accessible and useful to researchers, and further, a responsibility
 
to disseminate the results so that they can provide a direct benefit
 
to American Indian and other communities whose cultural heritage the
 
cylinders record.
 If the national Endowment for the Arts could
  
assist tribal cultural groups in raisin  the funds to purchase copies
 
of the recordings , as you su pest , that_wou 
e _
 e a great boon
  
to the project at the dissemination phase  a couple of years hence.
 In
 
the meantime, the task of basic preservation an  cataloging is only
 
partially completed.  We now estimate that finishing this first phase--
including cylinders in the possession of other federal agencies as
 
well as the Library--will require two more years and perhaps $150,000.
 
- 2 -
 
We shall be looking for funding to complete this task from a
 
variety of public or private sources.
 
It gives me great pleasure to know of your interest in
 
the Federal Cylinder Project and your willingness to join in the
 
effort where appropriate.
 If you should ever care to see and hear
 
personally how we are going about our work with early cylinder
 
recordings, please let me know, and I should be delighted to
 
arrange a special briefing for your benefit.
 
With all best wishes,
 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Dan:
 
A F
f ,dtral agency advisf-d by t

NahOnal COUncil On t
he A
rts
 
As we discussed last week,  the so-called "Federal Cyllinder
 
Project"  is,  as you know,  already in progress at the
 
Library of Congress.
 For the past year it has been funded
 
by monies transferred from the Bureau of Indian Affairs
 
(
BIA)  and staffed by personnel assigned from the American
 
Folklife Center,  the Division of Recorded Sound and the
 
Smithsonian Institution.
 Bess Hawes, Director of our own
 
Folk Arts Program who has been personally interested in this
 
project from its inception,  tells me that several reports
 
are available from Alan Jabbour's office detailing both
 
the needs and the progress made thus far.
 A copy of the
 
preliminary survey of 1978 is attached to refresh your
 
memory.
 
As I think you know,  the ;
arts '
.
Endowment would be more than
 
delighted to assist in funding this effort directly if only
 
we could do so without the problem of Congressional
 
prohibition against transfer of funds among agencies which
 
are primarily federally funded.'  Already we are beginning
 
to receive inquiries from Native American tribes who are
 
overjoyed to hear that their federally recorded and archived
 
music,  tales,  and histories are finally being made accessible.
 
l
ie certainly stand ready to cooperate with the Humanities
 
Endowment in assisting  .he dissemination phase of this
 
extraordinarily worthy project.
 All that is needed now
 
is to complete the copying and the scholarly research
 
necessary in order to make the field notes and other
 
peripheral data available along with the actual recordings
 
themselve .
 An investment of two more years and less than
 
$100,000 appears to be required.
 At this stage,  the Library
 
itself has the only facilities and staff
_ qualified to
 
renroduc^ these uniquely significant holdings.
 
BOORSTIN,

I venture to bring this situation to your attention because
 
it represents such an excellent opportunity for federal
 
agencies to provide,  at minimal cost,  materials of extreme
 
importance to our Native American citizenry and to the
 
scholarly community as well.
 It should make all the
 
cooperating agencies many friends and no enemies.
 If the
 
Library of Congress can continue to act as the lead agency
 
in this important endeavor,  and fund the basic copying costs,
 
I can assure you that the Arts Endowment will pick up its
 
part of the responsibility  (
assisting Native American tribes
 
to raise the funds to buy copies .of the materials produced)
 
when the appropriate time comes.
 The Library's out of pocket
 
costs would thus gradually be.repaid.
 
Let us know if you would like further discussion.
 
All best wishes,
 
Ever sincerely,

my contribution to the project was lacking in any way, I have continued to
 
a
ssume the arrangement was satisfactory.  If i
t i
s not, then I feel you owe i
t
 
to me to say so d
irectly and I will e
ither correct matters, or, if that i
s not
 
f
easible, will graciously s
tep down from the position.
 
1
.  Folklife Center Board M
eetings.  The most recent i
s past history, of
 
course, a
nd you d
id apologize to me.  The problem i
s that I am never informed
 
witil the last minute that 1 am expected to make a presentation on t
he Cylinder
 
Project.  Fortunately, Maria briefed me i
n t
ime f
or this spring meeting.
 
2
.  The Washington Star article.  This particularly hurt me, a
s Boris
 
Weintraub i
s a personal friend.  I
 was never notified of the i
nterview, and
 
my d
irectorship was only briefly mentioned near the end of the piece.  I would
 
hasten to point out that, by contrast, when the Smithsonian News  Serv ice  did an  
a
rticle on the Cylinder Proje ct
, you were g
iven advance notification and i
n
 
f
act i
nsisted on proofing and editing i
t yourself before i
t went to press.
 
3
.  The Department of I
nterior visit.  This one bothered the s
taff more
 
t
han me, but i
t i
s typical.  They c
laim that, a
lthough the visit had been on
 
t
he appointment s
chedule, they were g
iven about 1
5 minutes notice to get their
 
a
ct together, which, I understand, was unnerving to t
hem, particularly s
ince the
 
Cylinder Project was supposed to be of great i
nterest to the v
isitor.
 
4
.  The National Public Radio i
nterview.  Again,  I know of this only
 
after Erika p
layed me the f
inal edited recording.  I regret to say that, in the
 
course of h
 er i
nterview, she i
ncorrectly identified the example she was using,
 
having a
ssumed the l
abel on the box to be correct, when i
t wasn't (
possibly the
 
cylinder was i
n the wrong container).  Had e
ither Maria or I been present or
 
had a chance to proof the radio program, we would have caught the error.  I f
eel
 
t
hat such i
ncidents are a personal embarrassment to me and potentially damaging
 
both to the Project and to my professional s
tanding as well as your own.  Why
 
have I
ndian music specialists on your s
taff if they are to be c
ircumvented?  I
 
c
an only hope this program e
scapes l
istening by anyone who knows I am director
 
of the project.
 
S
.  The Winnebago cylinder copying.  You w
ill recall that I spent a good
 
deal of effort promoting Nancy Lurie's i
nvolvement on this, shepherding with
 
Sally Yerkovitch the grant through NEH as well as two s
ite v
isits in the f
ield
 
to a
ssist Nancy.  Several weeks ago Nancy wrote anxiously t
hat she had reached
 
a
n impasse w
ith her i
nformant.  What she needed most urgently (
and she i
s the sole
 
j
udge of this, h
aving worked with t
hese people for decades) were copies of the
 
r
emaining o
lder material, e
specially F
letcher's and Barrett's.  She f
elt that
 
t
he change i
n material would put her i
nformant "back on track" a
nd rekindle h
is
 
i
nto^rest in the project.  I gave the l
etter to Ron, talked with both Ron and
 
Erika about the urgency or the s
ituation, asked how to expedite matters t
hrough
 
t

i

ssumed,

was going to walk through.
 I went i
nto the cage, l
ocated t
he Barrett material
 
and reordered i
t for co ping.  The some 25 cylinders are l
isted as "
Iroquois"
 
but were actually W
innebago, which I had suspected from their s
ong texts,
 
c
orrectly so after spot l
istening.  '
T
hese medicine l
odge s
ongs had been copied
 
many years ago onto d
iscs, were l
isted a
s on a r
eference t
ape, but upon
 
l
istening to t
hat, I couldn't l
ocate them.  I
n any case, these cylinders
 
needed to be recopied with our new machine.  For i
nstance, one cylinder l
isted
 
a
s broken a
nd thus not copied earlier proved to have a
t l
east a third of i
ts
 
program retrievable so that a
t l
east that much could be available to the
 
i
nformant.  Erika had requested that the cylinder copying be l
eft to the e
nd of
 
l
ast week, when s
he would get to them.  By yesterday (
Tuesday), a day before I
 
was to l
eave, I had a
ssumed everything would be i
n order f
or me to transfer the
 
material to cassette f
or Nancy and mail i
t to her, s
o she would have a week to
 
work through i
t before I arrived to help with problems.  I discovered, however,
 
on phoning Ron, that f
or some reason unknown to me s
till, i
nstead of copying the
 
c
ylinders a
s requested, Ron and Erika spent f
ive days, according to him "
tracking
 
down i
nformation" concerning the d
isc recordings made i
n the 1
930s.  Having
 
l
ocated them, they d
iscovered they were i
n mouldy and generally poor s
hape.
 
Ron thought they deserved a medal f
or their efforts.  I don't.  I

 (
Ron does not s
eem to have pursued the o
ther
 
material i
n the meantime, having apparently been diverted to the research
 
d
irection he a
nd Erika had chosen).
 I don't know a

but c
learly a decision was made by the s
taff t

Mrs. Raye Virginia Allen
 
Chairman, Board of Trustees
 
American Folklife Center
 
The Library of Congress
 
Washington, D
.C. 20540
 
Dear Mrs. Allen:
 
At the outset , permit me to congratulate you on assuming the
 
role of Chairman of our Folklife Center Board . I have been impressed
 
with the manner in which Dr. Hand and Mr. Voight conducted the business
 
of the Board during their respective tenures, and I am confident that
 
your term ultimately will be as successful as it promises to be chal-
lenging.
 
In responding to your January 10th memorandum regarding the
 
Tennessee -Tombigbee Waterway Folklife Project, I do wish to note my
 
approval of the cultural and geographical diversification which has
 
characterized the Center 's approach to its first projects over the
 
past two and one -half years.  The policy of securing supplementary
 
fiscal and organizational support for the Chicago , Georgia, Blue Ridge
 
and Nevada endeavors seems prudent and has served the Center well.
 
The extension of this principle to the Tennessee -Tombigbee endeavor
 
would be less disquieting if several attendant considerations were not
 
involved . As a member of the Board, I feel a responsibility to express
 
my concern about the adequacy of management experience within the Center
 
for an endeavor of this magnitude , sensitivity and public visibility.
 
The budget of the project is ten times that of any project heretofore
 
undertaken by the Center , and it exceeds the total FY 1979 Federal
 
Appropriation to the Center by more than $100,000.  A more gradual devel-
opment pattern would appear to be preferable.
 
I might have wished that the first major project of the Center were
 
one which did not bear the tarnish of ecological and natural conservation
 
issues.
 I understand that it was my commitment to the protection of
 
endangered natural species that influenced Mr. Rinzler to abstain from
 
supporting the Board's decision on this project at your November meeting
 
-
2-
in Vermont.  If the Center i
s to proceed with this project, may I
 
urge that it do so with sensitivity to the natural a
s well a
s the
 
cultural conservation i
ssues involved?
 
On the particular question at hand, I am advised by our senior
 
contracts staff that the Smithsonian a
lways attempts to obtain a
 
qualified contractor who i
s capable of securing a performance bond
 
from a U
.S. Treasury-approved surety company.  This procedure would
 
seem prudent in this case - especially in view of the considerable
 
s
ize of the total budget of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Folklife Project
 
a
nd the fact that the F
olklife Center is not yet experienced in the
 
management of projects of this size and complexity.
 
F
inally, I do urge the Board to reconsider its commitment  to  
this project, e
specially in l
ight of the absence from the November
 
meeting of the Agriculture Department representative and both the
 
Arts a
nd Humanities Endowment chairmen, or their representatives.
 
I
t was a
t this meeting that the critical vote was taken.  Should
 
you c
hoose to proceed, permit me to encourage the Board a
nd the
 
L
ibrary's administrative s
taff to do so with due caution a
s this
 
i
s a
n endeavor which a
ppears to be fraught with risks.

AMERICAN FOLKLIFE CENTER
 
Dear Mr. Ripley:
 
THE L
IBRARY OF CONGRESS
 
WASHINGTON, D
.C. 20540
 
January 3
1, 1979
 
Raye Virginia Allen has shared with me your letter
 
to her of January 25.  She will be replying t
o you as Chairman
 
of the Board of Trustees of the American Folklife Center; but
 
she has suggested, and I agree, that it would be appropriate f
or
 
me t
o s
hare directly with you my thoughts about t
he conception,
 
the plan, and the need for the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway
 
Folklife Project.
 
As I sat down t
o compose this letter, I reviewed the
 
various documents which had been prepared last summer for the
 
Board of Trustees.
 In particular, my lengthy memorandum of
 
July 10, 1978, t
o the Projects Committee of the Board (
including
 
you) s
till represents my sense of the need for this project.  I
 
am enclosing another copy of t
hat memorandum, in case the original
 
copy i
s not at hand for you, and I am also enclosing a copy of the
 
project statement sent t
o the Board and to the Department of the
 
Interior in July.
 
It strikes me, as I now reflect on t
hese documents, that
 
your concerns about -
the project on policy grounds echo my own.
 
The Archeological and Historic Preservation Act (
P. L
. 93-291),
 
often referred t
o as t
he Moss-Bennett Act, states c
learly the
 
obligation of the federal government to mitigate the adverse impact
 
of dam and waterway projects on the scientific and cultural
 
resources of the impacted area.  The vision to which I clung, as I
 
developed this project, was of a model project which f
or the first
 
time would use the authority of that preservation act to help preserve
 
the living cultural traditions endangered by the coming waterway.  Such
 
a project both would serve to define "
cultural resources" in a
 
broader and more living sense, and at the same t
ime would link, as
 
they properly should be linked, those forces devoted to cultural
 
preservation and those devoted to natural preservation.  I regard
 
those linkages as a great national challenge for all of us in the
 
- 2 -
 
coming decade.  Thus, when you urge the Center to show sensitivity to
 
natural as well as cultural conservation issues, I find myself in
 
profound agreement with you.
 
In short, I wonder whether our differences on these
 
i
ssues are more apparent than real.
 Somehow I cannot help feeling
 
that this is an issue where our agencies share common interests
 
and the common cause of natural and cultural preservation.
 I
 
should be pleased to discuss further my perception of these issues
 
with you if you wish.

January 31, 1979
 
Dear Mr. Ripley:
 
Thank you for your letter of January 25th.
 I am
 
grateful for your expression of confidence in my tenure as
 
Chairman and your comments of general approval regarding the
 
approach of the Board of Trustees'to field projects.
 
I assure you I am equally grateful for your expression
 
of concern regarding the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Folklife
 
Project.
 As Chairman of the Board, I am anxious to secure the
 
full participation of Board members on p
olicy issues.  Let me
 
address your concerns, and perhaps begin exploring means for
 
easing them.
 
Your first consideration regards the management
 
experience of the Center for the endeavor.  The general
 
strategy we have employed in the Center's development from the
 
outset called for a small versatile professional staff capable of
 
managing various model projects engaged in with assistance from
 
outside sources.
 In the project at hand and in others currently under
 
consideration, our plan has been to engage fulltime project directors
 
who combine administrative experience with professional experience
 
in folklife to carry out the project under the broad supervision of
 
the Center's professional staff.
 
The magnitude of the project was prominently discussed
 
at the two Board meetings during which this project was under active
 
consideration,. both within the Projects Committee and before the
 
full Board to which it was referred.
 It has always been the Board's
 
intent to build on the cumulative experience of the Center's projects,
 
refining professional and administrative techniques as our programming
 
moves toward new and larger initiatives.
 
Related to your managerial concerns is the particular
 
matter of the nature of the contract with the Project Director.
 
The procedure proposed by the Center is specifically authorized
 
in the Center's legislation (
P.L. 94-201, Section 7 (
a), paragraphs
 
7 and 8
),and the contract has been carefully drawn up by the
 
Library's Contracting Officer in close consultation with the Library's
 
General Counsel.
 I am of course confident in the Library's expertise
 
in these areas; the Center has greatly benefited from the administrative
 
assistance of the Library as an institution.
 
(

Regarding t
he second consideration, I appreciate and
 
sympathize with your concern t
hat the project incorporate a
 
sensitivity to the issues of ecological and natural conservation
 
raised by the building of the waterway.  Again, this is a matter
 
which was deliberated at the May and November Board meetings, both
 
with the Projects Committee and with the full Board.
 I agree that
 
any effort on behalf of cultural conservation in the area must take
 
into consideration and complement natural and ecological concerns.
 
The Director of the Center, who developed the philosophy of the
 
project and presented it to the Board, should perhaps present his
 
point of view directly to you.
 I have spoken with Alan Jabbour,
 
and he will write you on the subject.
 
I have asked the staff of the Center to prepare a
 
chronology which highlights the development-of this project, and I
 
am enclosing a copy for your consideration.
 It indicates lengthy,
 
careful procedures in the development of the project and orderly
 
presentation of it to the Board.  You already have the minutes from
 
the May and November meetings which record the discussion that took
 
place then.
 
Finally, let me repeat my appreciation for your
 
expression of concern.
 I think it would be appropriate to share
 
your concerns with the Board at its next meeting.  The Board
 
will meet on Friday, February 23, 1979, at the Library of Congress,
 
and we shall include a place in the agenda for further discussion
 
of the project.
 It would be especially helpful if you were able
 
to attend personally to share your thoughts and reflections with
 
US.
 We s
hall be pleased to schedule the agenda to suit your
 
convenience.
 
Sincerely yours,
 
Raye Virginia Allen

A preliminary plan for the project , drawn up in June of
 
1978, is available . This action mould s

presently inaccessible music of great historical interest.
 
M
ay sense L

April meeting of a committee of Native American sch7lars,
 
assembled by the American PoLklife Center at the Library
 
of G>ngress.  The origLnal plan had been for a two-year
 
project at around $300,000 ;
 my  prediction is that the
 
committee will reranmend a three year project at $500,000.
 
(
Now caches of material keep turning up all the ti m. )
 
The Bureau of Indian Affai

SUBJECT
 Request for Chairman's Grant:
 Federal
 
Cylinder Spin-Off Projects
 
In the Spring of 1979,  the American Folklife Center at
 
the Library of Congress began a project which involves the
 
preservation of wax cylinder recordings of American Indian
 
folk music and folklore.
 The original cylinders were made
 
in the field between 1890 and 1930.
 This Federal Cylinder
 
Project will duplicate the cylinders and will eventually
 
arrange for the distribution of copies to regional and
 
tribal archives around the country.
 
As the project develops,  the need for a number of ancillary
 
projects becomes evident.
 Further funds are needed to
 
update and to further annotate the cylinder recordings so
 
that the materials involved in the project will be ethno-
graphically,  linguistically and musically accurate for
 
future use.
 Although the cylinder copying per se is
 
being done under the auspices of the American Folklife
 
Center in Washington, D.C.,  the additional projects will
 
be conducted in a number of centers throughout the country
 
using local scholars and Native American informants for
 
their completion.
 Ron Wolcott,  one of the ethnomusicologists
 
working with the Federal Cylinder Project,  along with his
 
associates is in the process of preparing a list of the
 
estimated projects involving further documentation of the
 
tapes which will be generated during the copying process.
 
This information should be available within the next week
 
or two.
 
We are currently being requested to fund a project related
 
to the Winnebago materials in the cylinder collection.
 Funds
 
are needed to support a documentation project on the
 
traditional music of the Winnebago Indians in Wisconsin.
 
Most of the original materials about the Winnebago were
 
collected by Frances Densmore who had hoped to publish the
 
2
 
results of her work on Winnebago music as part of the Bureau
 
of American Ethnology bulletins.
 Densmore's as yet unpublished
 
manuscript is still in the Smithsonian archives.
 It includes
 
transcriptions and texts for songs as well as contextual
 
information provided by her informants.
 
A preliminary study of the manuscript and those recordings
 
already copied reveals that there are many more songs contained
 
on the cylinders than Densmore included in her manuscript and
 
which therefore lack any documentation.
 A trial identification
 
session with a Winnebago elder listening to certain of the
 
recordings shows that Densmore's song texts and orthography
 
are faulty and her translations inaccurate.
 Copies of the
 
recordings will be returned to the Winnebago and it would
 
be most desirable to include with these copies the best
 
possible documentation.
 This documentation would then be
 
available to the tribe for their own use as well as to
 
scholars in the field.
 
Dr. Nancy Lurie,  head of anthropology at the Milwaukee Public
 
Museum, has agreed to work through the recordings with her
 
informants to obtain more information about the songs and
 
their traditional contexts,  to correct and update Densmore's
 
information, and to identify songs lacking any documentation.
 
Dr.  Lurie,  through years of close association with the
 
Winnebago,  is the authority on this tribe.
 She has published
 
extensively on the Winnebago culture.
 
I would recommend that a grant of $3,000 be given to Dr.  Lurie
 
to complete the project with the Winnebago.
 This project
 
could then be used as a trial which would serve as an example
 
to use in the face of future requests.
 The general issue
 
of support for projects related to the Federal Cylinder
 
Project is one which is complex.
 The list which is being
 
prepared for us now by the Cylinder Project staff will be
 
of some help in determining the scope of possible requests.
 
I would like to discuss the larger issues involved with
 
the Folk Culture Advisory Panel when they meet in early
 
February.

Dear Sally,
 
I have enclosed a recent letter to me from Nancy Lurie at the Milwaukee
 
Public Museum. Nancy is helping the Federal Cylinder Project by working with
 
the Winnebago at Black River Falls, Wisconsin. She is an authority on this
 
tribe and has excellent rapport with the people going back several decades.
 
As part of the documentation/dissemination phases of the Cylinder Project,
 
we have targeted Wisconsin for some early experiments for the reasons cited
 
in my general newsletter about the Project (
see enclosed). Clearly the in-
volvement of as many Federal agencies in this worthwhile venture i
s desira-
ble, which is why I am writing you. Bess Hawes has already indicated the
 
willingness of her program to help with the dissemination aspects of the
 
Project, the Luis "o Culture Bank being one such effort. It seems to me
 
that the Humanties Endowment could be very helpful in the documentation
  
phase of the Cylinder Project by supporting the sort of program which
 
Nancy and I have proposed for the Winnebago. You will note that the budget
 
she suggests in her letter contains no compensation for her own t
ime--it
 
i
s a labor of love for her, and an excellent opportunity to obtain first
 
hand documentation of an important musical culture about which little is
 
really known.
 
Could we have a phone call about this at your earliest convenience?

No, I haven't forgotten my promise to send you a budget.  I had hoped
 
to get up to Winnebago country to check out details with Wilbur Blackdeer
 
but no luck thanks to demands on my t
ime here concerning t
he CETA program
 
and justifications to be written to argue for permanent staff in t
he 1980
 
budget.
 
My best estimate is about an hour per song--lyrics and new recording
 
whenever possible.  There are about 200 songs i
n all, but in some cases
 
I think Wilbur or others may want to present the whole set where Densmore
 
only made a rather arbitrary selection of, e
.g., f
irst and last in set of
 
four.  So, f
iguring $10.00 an hour for existing songs and maybe as many
 
as 50 new songs:
 
1
.  Work with singers, $10.00 an hour, 250 hours
 
2
.  Tapes
 
3
.  Travel -- just gas, 5 round trips, Black River
 
Falls-Milwaukee, WI. $20.00 @
 
Travel among Winnebago communities
 
4
.  Contingency funds--e.g., besides hourly rate, certain
 
types of information require particular kinds of gifts
 
such as tobacco, yard goods, fruit or meat

$2,500. 00
 
100. 00
 
1
00. 00

I think I will be able to get a good casette recorder t
hrough the
 
Friends of the Museum but have not been able to locate a dealer in Milwaukee
 
who handles Nakamichi or the Sony you recommend.  Any suggestions?  I
'd
 
like to see and try the equipment.
 
Although I hope to get up t
o Black River Falls at least once before
 
t
he snow f
lies, most of t
he work will b
e during t
he summer of 1
980.
 
I hope this estimate i
s acceptable.  Please f
eel f
ree to make any
 
changes.  I had to guess on cost of t
apes for new recording and have not
 
f
igured in your costs of making two each of casettes of music I do not
 
yet have from the total Densmore collection of Winnebago music.

o a
ct as recording engineer. F
irst t
o ar-

where he studied up coun
try r itual
 music
 i
n  Sri L
anka (
he i
s c
urrently working;
 
 
I
 
on a second doctorate at UCLA).  Ron w
as joined by Kirin L

s
tudent of Charlotte F
leth's a
t
. UCLA, who is completing her doctoral disser-
tation on compositional t
echniques in t
he '
Turtle Dance songs of San Juan
 
Pueblo. Erika Brady, a doctoral candidate in f
olklore at I
ndiana Univer-
s
ity, has spent a year and two subsequent summers as a recording engineer
 
at the L
ibrary of Congress , where she received expert training from Robert
 
Carneal in the duplication of cylinder recordings. As of the f
irst of Aug-
ust she has been able to devote her t
ime fully to t
he cylinder project.  I
 
am happy to report that it i
s a most compatible d
ram, and t
hat their par-
t
icular individual assignments are overlapping, mach as we l
e
ad anticipated
 
would be the optimum working arrangement, i
.c., t
he three of them, though
 
sometimes scattered throughout the L
ibrary, r
ire s
till w
ithin c
alling d
is-
tance of each other when the need arises. Thus,  f
or example, when i
n doubt,
 
the engineer can consult with the ethnomusicologist about a certain play-
back speed, for which the ethnomusicologist checks the p
itches against a
 
transcription by the collector, or about t
he content of a g
iven cylinde>,
 
to be checked against catalogs and other documentation.
 
One decision which came out of our .
June consultations was to record a
 
second channel s
imultaneously whilc copying t
he c
ylinder. The s
econd chan-
nel i
s used by the engineer to record pertinent i
nformation, such as the
 
physical condition of the cylinder, speeds used i
n copying, and any other
 
matters concerning t
he progress of the r
ecording. After some experimenting,
 
Erika now feels comfortable with t
his arrangement, and we are hopeful t
hat
 
it w
ill reduce the need to r
etrieve cylinders i
n f
uture years.
 
We selected W
isconsin tribal groups as a s
ort o
f' (

we could monitor to determine what p
roblems (
and t
heir s
olutions) �
aould
 
present themselves in d

ad a

here was no delay to the rest of t

we s
imply ordered high speed duplications from t
he Recording L

which I could take with me to t

of the most traditional members of the B

While progress has been excellent to date, t
here i
s s
ome question about
 
maintaining the momentum we have achieved, f
or we must somehow enlist fur-
ther f
inancial support to continue the project beyond December, when cur-
rent funding will have been exhausted. We have a
ttempted through news re-
l
eases and personal contacts to keep o
ther Federal agencies and Congress
 
informed of the project. The Wisconsin plan, f
or i
nstance, was described
 
in some detail in a letter to each Senator and Congressman from that state,
 
and Ray Dockstader of the American Folklife Center has arranged two suc-
cessful meetings of the staff with a
ides of Congressmen from d
istricts
 
having large I
ndian populations or who serve o
n I
ndian Affairs committees.
 
Some long range questions are s
till to be addressed: for example, once
 
all the cylinders have been copied, s
hould t
he project extend t
o t
ake on
 
early disc recordings of I
ndian music? I
n t
he meantime,  I would l
ike to
 
express our appreciation of your continued i
nterest and support and will
 
keep you abreast of our progress in a future l
etter.

DRAFT
 
eV
 
March 8
, 1983
 
Dear Alan,
 
I write to open f
or formal discussion a situation that you and I have long
 
been acquainted with.  The grant files of the Folk Arts Program date back to
 
1974 and include projects supported by the Music Program under the old Folk/Ethnic
 
Music categories as well.  The vitae, support materials and final descriptive
 
reports -- narrative documents as well as actual products such as recordings
 
and photos --contained in these files are items of real historic and cultural
 
value t
o folklore researchers and the general public alike.  Further, these files
 
are themselves primary documents in the ongoing history of a remarkable federal
 
effort to bolster and support t
he aesthetic concerns of smaller regional, ethnic,
 
occupational, and familial cultures within the United States.  Whereas history is
 
replete with examples of attempts to drown out or stamp out the arts of smaller
 
groups, there are very few examples of how to do the opposite, s
o these files
 
contain a record t
hat will be of real interest, I believe, to future historians
 
of government as well as the general arts world.
 
However, our modest successes -- after all, we are still in business! --
have produced problems, particularly in terms of handling the physical custody
 
of t
he records.  We are running out of space.  Yet I hesitate to consign our
 
old materials to dead storage where at best they would be accessible with great
 
difficulty and at worst might well be lost.  Unlike the grants made by say the
 
IN
 
- 2 -
 
Museums Program or the.Fed/State Programs, copies of Folk Arts grants may not
 
retained by their recipients and, even if they were, they are so scattered as
 
to be extraordinarily difficult to reassemble.
 It seems safest to hand on to
 
them in a centralized
' federal repository.
 
We therefore'propose to transfer these records to the Archive of Folk
 
Culture at the Library of Congress, assuming that you are still interested in
 
receiving t
hem.
 (
Sample copies of our grants for each past fiscal year will
 
be supplied to the National Archives also, in accordance with the agreement
 
previously reached between the Archives and this agency.)
 
The transfer to the Archive of Folk Culture will give the Library of
 
Congress custodial ownership but not ownership of the rights of the materials
 
contained in them.  We understand that, although the grant folders themselves
 
will be kept together as a single collection, recordings, museum catalogues,
 
videotapes and similar materials they may contain will probably be deposited
 
in other sites within the Library under suitable storage conditions.  A note
 
concerning storage location will be placed in the appropriate grant file in all
 
such cases.  All files transferred will be open to the general public.  Files
 
of rejected applications will not be transferred; vitae and other useful data
 
will be extracted but the rejected applications themselves will go into agency
 
dead storage.
 Similarly, sensitive documents pertaining to approved grants will
 
be retained by the agency at the discretion of the Program Director.
 
In procedural terms, we plan to transfer all files generated during the
 
1974-1978 granting period during the spring or summer of 1983.  These files will
 
have been tidied up, duplicate materials discarded or placed in backup files and
 
a computerized finding list for Folk Arts Program and Archive use produced by
 
two folklorists/librarians, Holly Cutting-Baker and Jay Orr.  During the latter
 
part of 1983, Holly Cutting-Baker will prepare one more year's materials -- those
 
from fiscal .
1979 -- for transfer.
 In future years, an annual transfer will take
 
1
  
- 3 -
 
place; fiscal materials will be transferred t
o the Library during calendar
 
1984 and'so forth.
 
I hope this letter sums up all the topics you, Joe Hickerson, and I
 
discussed during our lengthy conference March third.
 If you see anthing
 
amiss or if I have omitted any important factor, please let me know.  Otherwise,
 
perhaps you would send a note of acceptance so that the two letters together
 
can stand as an agreement for the records of our mutual agencies.
 
With all best regards,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

The American Folklife Center's Federal Cylinder Project has begun a
 
special two-year dissemination project, funded by The Ford Foundation, to
 
share tape copies of early wax cylinder recordings of American Indian
 
music and narrative with the communities in which they were made.  Because
 
of your interest and involvement in historical material relating to
 
American Indians, we would like to invite you to a briefing on the
 
dissemination project:
 
Wednesday, May 8, 1985
 
9 A.M. to 12 noon
 
Whittall Pavilion, Jefferson Building
 
Library of Congress
 
During the term of the project we will attempt to contact every
 
tribe for which there are cylinder recordings in the Library of Congress.
 
Project staff will work closely with leaders from each community to
 
determine the most appropriate approaches to the return of the recordings,
 
and will offer consultant assistance in such areas as developing cultural
 
programs and setting up local repositories for the materials.  A special
 
advisory panel, drawn from the American Indian community, will assist the
 
project in its work.
 
You are also invited to attend a reception on Monday, May 6 from 5
 
to 7 P.M. in the East Dining Room, 6th floor Madison Building, Library of
 
Congress, to meet the members of the advisory panel and to inaugurate the
 
dissemination project.
 If you plan to attend these events, or if you
 
would like additional information about the project, please contact
 
Dorothy Sara Lee, director of the Federal Cylinder Project, at 287-9022.

MEMORANDUM
 
TO:  Beverly Kratochvil/International Program
 
FROM:  Daniel Sheehy,  Assistant Director/Folk Arts Program
 
SUBJECT:  Panelist comments on two US/Japan project proposals
 
On the project involving craftsman Nakashima,  quality was not an
 
issue.
 His work is of the highest calibre,  much admired by
 
Americans and Japanese alike.
 Mr.  Nakashima is well-known and
 
well-respected.  His workmanship is very much in a Japanese
 
style.
 One interesting aspect of his work is how the joining of
 
thge pieces  is not hidden,  but rather is  incorporated into the
 
design of the work.
 Generally speaking,  in the minds of the
 
American audience,  he is assocaiated with Japanese aesthetics
 
and Japanese artists.
 
The main question raised was the appropriateness on the project
 
as described for the US/Japan program.
 Mr.  Nakashima works both
 
in the United States  and in Japan,  but apparently is based
 
mostly in the United States.
 The money requested seems to be
 
for the costs of touring in the U.S.,  mainly for the exhibition,
 
catalogue,  and the largest expense,  the curator.
 Is there
 
anything in it for Japan?
 Why not do the tour internationally?
 
They seem to be planning one,  but those costs are not included.
 
On the second project,  the bringing to the U.S.  of the two
 
Japanese Noh and Kyogen performers,  quality was not a question.
 
The artists  are top-notch and an excellent selection for this
 
type of exchange.
 They both have experience working with
 
Americans  in a university setting,  as proposed.
 
The main overall  reservation about the project was the high
 
costs  involved.
 Must all of the back-and-forthing between Japan
 
and the U.S.  be done?
 Are the scholarships  really appropriate?
 
If the University supports the exchange, why not wave their own
 
tuition requirements?
 
The University of Hawaii  is experienced in working cooperatively
 
with Japanese performing artists.
 Previously,  they have brought
 
is kabuki  and noh performers successfully.
 This part would no
 
doubt be done well,  but the request to support five Japanese and
 
four American performers seems expensive.
 
The lecture/demonstratons in Noh and Kyogen on the West Coast in
 
May and June seem reasonable and feasible.
 A somewhat similar
 
symposium was done before in Los Angeles,  and it was quite
 
successful.
 Additional transportation to and from Japan
 
increase the costs considerably,  though.
 
The exhibit of Kyogen costumes in Hawaii  is a good idea,  but the
 
rental costs are higher than the artist fees.
 Also,  the
 
curator's travel to Japan may not be necessary.
 
The lecture/demonstrations to the public in Hawaii  are good.
 Is
 
the $1500 for publicity necessary?
 It may be.
 
The film series component is not justified.
 What are the films
 
that would enhance the rest of the project?
 Are there enough
 
films on Noh and Kyogen to make a series?
 
On the positive side,  the Berberich publication would live on
 
long beyond the events themselves and promises to be of high
 
quality.
 Also,  the English translation of the play texts would
 
greatly enhance their appreciation.
