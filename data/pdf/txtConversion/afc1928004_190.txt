MISS J'ENNIE ENGE L . 
OPINIONS OF THE PRESS . 
M ISS JENNIE ENGEL—This young lady is to finish her engagement 
at the Howard to- morrow evening 
Like its numerous predecessors, 
It has been very successful. 
Miss Engel is extremely popular in 
Boston, and this increases with each successive visit. 
As a 
vocalist, 
she is unexcelled, and in character songs, she stands without a 
rival. 
Some of her songs partake of the humorous and personal, and are ex-
tremely amusing and taking. 
Miss Engel is also a good actress in 
burlesque and comedy, and to her varied talents adds an attractive 
person and a 
fine taste in dress. 
So bright a 
star will shine wherever 
she may be. 
[Boston Post. 
JENNIE ENGEL, formerly of Tony Pastor's, is creating quite a 
sensa. 
tion in New Orleans. The critics declare that, " she singe like a 
verit-
able nightingale," and that " no other artist ever before achieved 
such rapid and merited popularity." [ N. Y. Herald. 
In the Olio performance, Miss JENNIE ENGEL sang us some very 
beautiful songs; and received in return the flattering tribute which 
is ever awarded to her sweet and simple melodies. 
She has won a 
place in the esteem of our play-going public, which is, indeed, most 
flattering to her professional pride. 
[New Orleans Times. 
The bewitching JENNIE ENGEL in her Comic Songs is the sensation 
of the season; and is, in her line, unrivaled and incomparable. 
[N. Y. Sunday limes. 
The pretty JENNIE ENGEL sang even more sweetly than ever, and 
her pleasant voice, burdened with exquisite melody, elicited the 
greatest approval from the auditors. 
[New Orleans Bee. 
JENNIE ENGEL is creating a 
furore, and is nightly encored. 
She is 
one of the best Serb- comic Vocalists inhe business; and has returned 
to Toney's, after playing several successful engagements South, 
where she received the title of the " Queen of Song." 
[N. Y. Mercury. 
M ISS JENNIE ENGEL, well known in theatrical circles, is now at this 
house. She has made a 
decided hit, and draws crowded houses in her 
Serio-comic Songs, which are all new. Her engagement promises to 
be a 
successful one. 
[N. Y. Sunday Nom 
THE HIGHWAYMAN. 
As sung by W M. B. 
CAVANAGH.. 
I 
am a 
gallant hero, 
That never yet was daunted, 
Robbing 0 
for gold, 
For that was seldom wanted. 
Robbing 0, for gold, 
For it was my only folly, 
And I'd rather live alone. 
Than with you, false-hearted Molly. 
Musha tura naddy ah, 
Whack fol de raddy ah, 
Whack fol de raddy ah, 
There's whiskey in the jug. 
As I 
was a 
travelling, 
O'er the famed Kilkenny Mountain, 
I 
met bold Captain Neville. 
And his money he was counting. 
I 
first pulled out my fire-lock, 
And then I 
drew my ripper, 
Crying, stand and deliver, 
For I 
am a 
gay deceiver. 
Musha tura nady ah, eice 
I 
longed to see my Molly, 
And much I 
needed slumber, 
I 
went into my chamber, 
And laid me down to rest.

THE HIGHWAYNAN.—CONCLUDED. 
She came in and drew my pistols, 
And filled them both with water, 
And I 
was led a8eay like 
A lamb unto the slaughter. 
Musha tura nady ah, 
Then early next morning, 
Between six and seven, 
Surrounded by the Peelers, 
And likewise Captain Neville, 
I 
flew unto my pistols. 
But in that I 
was mistaken, 
I 
fired off all the water, 
And a 
prisoner I 
was taken. 
Musha tura nady ah, 
I 
have two li ttle brothers, 
Enlisted in the army, 
One of them's in Cork, 
And the other in Killarney. 
14:they were here to-night, 
Faith ' tis I'd be free and jolly, 
I'd rather have them here to-night, 
Than you, deceitful Molly. 
Musha tura nady ah, 
Farewell unto the banks 
Of the pleasent sweet Killarney, 
Farewell unto you, Molly, 
And your false deceitful blarney. 
Farewell unto you, Molly, 
You're the cause of all my sorrow, 
And I 
will be dead, 
Ere the dawn before to-morrow. 
Musha tura nady ah, 4r.e.

THE NEWGATE STONE. 
When Claude du Val was in Newgate thrown, 
lie carved his name on the dungeon stone; 
Quoth a 
dubsman, who gazed on the shattered wall, 
"You have carved your epitaph, Claude du Val. 
With your chisel so fine, tra la!" 
Duval was hang'd, and the next who came 
On the selfsame stone inscribed his name; 
" 
Alia!" quoth the dubsman, with devilish glee! 
"Tom Waters, your doom is the triple tree ! 
With your chisel so fine, tra In 2" 
Within that dungeon lay Captain Bew, 
Rumbold and Whitney—a 
jolly crew ! 
All carved their names on the stone, and all 
Shared the fate of the brave Du Val! 
With their chisels so fine, t 
ra in 
Full twenty highwaymen blithe and bold, 
Rattled their chains in that dungeon old ; 
Of all that number there 'scaped not one, 
Who carved his name on the Newgate Stone. 
With his chisel so fine, tin la! 
FAKE AWAY. 
In a 
box of the stone jug I 
was born, 
Of a 
hempen widow the kid forlorn. 
•/- 
Fake away 
And my noble father, as I've heard say, 
Was a 
mounts merchant of capers gay. 
Nix my dolly pals, fake away. 
Nix my dolly pals, fake away. 
The knucks in quod did my schoolmen play 
And put me up to the time o' day. 
Fake away! 
No dummy hunter had forks so fly, 
No knuckler so deftly could fake a 
ely. 
Nix my dolly pals, fake away. 
Nix my dolly pals, fake away. 
But my nuttiest lady one fine day 
To the beaks did her gentleman betray. 
Fake away I 
And so I 
was bowled out at last, 
And into the jug for a 
lag was cast. 
Nix my dolly pals, take away. 
Nix my dolly pals, take away. 
But I 
slipped my darbies one fine day, 
And gave to the dubsman a 
holiday. 
Fake away 
And here I 
am, pals, merry and free, 
A regular rollicking Romany. 
Nix my dolly pals, fake away, 
Nix my dolly pals,,fake away. 
NOW FAREWELL. 
Am : " Then farewell my trim-built wherry!" 
Now farewell my scamps and tories, 
Tolls, and popps, and all farewell. 
London—scene of all my glories 
where I 
oft have conic the swell I 
Tyburn, once I 
view'd reflective— 
Come, old man, we'll now kiss hands— 
Welcome to my new perspective— 
Cracking cribs in other lands.

THE DEAR IRISH BOY.—NoscLuDED.1 
No roebuck more swifter can flee o'er the mountain, 
No Briton bolder ' midst danger or scar; 
He's slightly, he's lightly, he's as clear as the fountain, 
His eyes twinkling love, and he's gone to the war. 
Cho.— Smiling, beguiling, &c. 
The soft-tuning lark, its notes shall cease mourning, 
The dull screaming owl shall cease its night's sleep, 
While seeking lone walks in the shades of the evening, 
If my Connor return not, I'll never cease to weep. 
Cho.—Smiling, beguiling, &c. 
The war is all over, and my love is not returning, 
I 
fear that some envious plot has been laid, 
Or some cruel goddess has him captivated, 
And left me to mourn here, a 
dear Irish maid. 
Cho.—Smili g, beguiling, &c. 
YOU'LL SOON FORGET KATHLEEN. 
Sung by M ISS JENNIE ENGEL. 
[The circumstance, which gave rise to this beautiful ballad, occurred 
during the visit of a 
friend of the author to the north of Ireland, and 
was most feelingly related to the author by him. 
It was the parting of a 
young tenant,farmer from his betrothed, on going to seek his fortune 
in some distant land.] 
Oh! leave not your Kathleen, there's no one can cheer her, 
Alone in the wide world, unpitied 
sigh: 
And scenes that were loveliest, when thou wert but near her, 
Recall the sad visions of days long gone by! 
'Tis vain that you tell me: you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'er return more: 
Far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me— 
You'll soon forget Kathleen, and Erin Go Bragh 
Oh! leave not the land, the sweet land of your childhood, 
Where joyously passed the first days of our youth, 
Where gaily we wandered 'mid valley and wildwood: 
Oh! those were the bright days of innocent truth! 
'Tis vain that you tell me; you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'er return more 
Far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me— 
You'll soon forget-Kathleen, and Erin Go Bragh 1

SAINT GILES'S BOWL 
Where Saint Giles's church stands, once a lazar-house 
stood; 
And chained to its gates, was a 
vessel of wood; 
A broad-bottomed bowl, from which all the fine fellows 
Who passed by that spot, on their way to the gallows— 
Might tipple strong beer, 
Their spirits to cheer. 
And drown in a 
sea of good liquor all tear, 
For nothing the transit to Tyburn beguiles 
So well as the draught from the Bowl of Saint Giles. 
By many a 
highwayman, many a 
draught 
Of nutty-brown ale at Saint Giles's was quaft, 
Until the old lazar-house chanced to fall down, 
And the broad-bottom'd bowl was removed to the Crown, 
Where the robber may cheer 
his spirits with beer, 
And drown in a 
sea of good liquor all tear 
For nothing the transit to Tyburn beguiles 
So well as the draught from the bowl of Saint Giles. 
There 3.1elsack and Swiftneek, both prigs from their birth, 
Old Mob and Tom Cox took their last draught on earth; 
There Randal and Shorter and Whitney pulled up, 
And Jolly Jack Joice drank his finishing cup 
For a 
can of ale calms, 
A high wayman's qualms, 
And makes him sing blithely his dolorous psalms 1 
For nothing the transit to Tyburn beguiles 
So well as a 
draught trout the nowl ot Saint Giles. 
When gallant Tom Sheppard to Tyburn was led— 
" 
Stop the cart at the Crown—stop a 
moment," he said, 
He was offered the bowl, but he left it and smiled, 
Crying, " Keep it till called for by Jonathan Wild ; 
" 
The rascal one day, 
sWill pass by- this way. 
" 
And drink a 
full meas tire to moisten his clay 
" 
And never will bowl of Saint Giles have beguiled 
Such a 
thorough-paced s 
coundrel as Jonathan Wild.” 
Should it e'er be my lot to ride backwards that way, 
AL 
the door of the Crown I 
will certainly stay ; 
I'll summon the landlord—PH call for the bowl. 
And drink a 
deep draught to the health ef my soul 
Whatever may bat). 
yr taste of the tap, 
To keep up my spirits when brought to the trap! 
Nor nothing the transit to Tyburn beguiles 
o

WITH HIS FOODLE DOO. 
Once on a 
time, as 'I've heard tell, 
In Wych Street Owen Wood did dwell: 
A 
carpenter he was by trade, 
And money, I 
believe, be made. 
With his foodle doo I

This carpenter he had a 
wife, 
The plague and torment of his life, 
Who though she did her husband scold,

Now Owen Wool had one fair child, 
Unlike her mother, meek and mild; 
Her love the draper strove to gain, 
But she repaid him with disdain. 
With his foodle doo! 41:c. 
In vain he fondly urged his suit, 
And all in vain the question put; 
She answered,—" Mr. 'William Kneebone, 
Of me, sir, you shall never be bone.

JOLLY NOSE. 
Jolly nose! the bright rubies that garnish the tip 
Are dug from t 
he mines of Canary ; 
And to keep up their lustre I 
moisten my lip 
With hogsheads of claret and sherry. 
Jolly nose I 
he who sees thee across a 
broad glass 
Beholds thee in all thy perfection ; 
And to the pale snout of a 
temperate ass, 
Entertains the profoundest objection. 
For a 
big-
bellied glass is the pallette I 
use, 
And the .choicest of wine is my colour; 
And I 
find that my nose takes the mellowest hues, 
The fuller I 
fill it the fuller. 
Jolly nose! there are fools who say drink hurts the sight, 
Such dullards know nothing about it, 
"Es better with wine, to extinguish the light, 
Than live always, in darkness, without it? 
CEASE YOUR FUNNING. 
Cease your funning, 
Force or cunning, 
Never shall my heart trepan ; 
All these sallies, 
Are but malice, 
To seduce my constant man. 
'Tis most certain, 
By their flirting, 
Women oft have envy shown; 
Pleas'd to ruin 
Others' wooing, 
Never happy in their own.

Composed by T. II. BAYLEY. 
"My daughter's an accomplish'd girl, 
Now Mary, that's absurd ; 
'Tis thus she always runs away,

But since she has thus left us, sir,

And prove that such a

You'll very rarely meet. 
Her drawings. Sir,— all Poonah work,

Her Poonah drawings— surely, sir, 
That girl's a

Excuse a 
partial mother, sir.— 
But think how she will please 
Her husband, should she ever wed, 
With Poonah works like these. 
And look, sir, here is her guitar— 
Dear me, it wants a 
string ! 
You're fond of music— after tea 
Prevail on her to sing. 
She ha-; not got much voice. you know, 
But take the nearest chair, 
And stoop your head and you will then 
Distinctly hear the air. 
And here is all her worsted work— 
A pair of slippers. sir — 
l'm sure hell be a 
happy man 
Who wins that gift from her, 
She made that rug—now, do observe, 
How natural the cat! 
She work'd that screen—you must allow 
There's intellect in that. 
And here's her album— bound in blue, 
With clasp, and lock, and key— 
Oh, such sweet lines about—" How doth

We've heard of Esop's fables, when 
At school we got our licks, 
And, I

The bundle made of sticks. 
The moral's stick together, boys, 
Atni that moral's tar from wrong, 
So pull, pull, together is 
The burden of my song. 
CHORUS.—Pull, pull together, boys,

My maxim was the same ; 
By all the Dons and Proctors,

Stretched to their oars, my fay'rite cry

And many a

THE TIN—POT BAND. 
Words by W ALTER BURNOT. 
Music by VINCENT DAVIS. 
My music now is all the rage, 
Not only on but off the stage, 
For this is a 
progressing ago, 
And bands of various kinds appear. 
The German band we all have met, 
With the everlasting flageolet, 
And the organ-grinder's band I 
bet, 
Will be found in most streets far and near. 
But search each land from strand to strand, 
And hunt about on ev'ry hand. 
There's none, not one. so full of fun, 
As the Seven Dials Tin-pot band.

I'm the tip-top man in the Tin-pot band, 
Bang ! bang ! :tint 1 
mighty grand, 
I'm the tip-top man in the Tin-pot band. 
Our noble army of police 
Won't give the street bands any peace, 
But daily plice brass bands increase, 
Altho' they'd lots of brass before. 
Teetotalers have Italian bands, 
Th ,re's nigger bands on Ramsgate sands, 
But there's none can boast such first-rate hands, 
As our Tin-pot band which numbers four. 
But search each land, l&c. [ Bang I

Our band consists of marrow-bones, 
Somc shovels, cleavers, pots of stoneS. 
And ev'ry one who hears us owns. 
We are musicians one and all; 
In Seven Dials we're all the rage, 
A 
cellar-flap is of our stage, 
And we're always ready to engage, 
At an Irish wake or butcher's ball. 
I &C, 
But search each land, &c. [ Bang I

The boys admire my uniform, 
It looks so cool and yet its warm ; 
And of applause I

must go. 
You know the butcher's shop below,

HIS NAME WASN'T LARGE ON THE BILLS. 
Written by Wm. B. CAVANAGIL 
Sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Bill Cotton a 
vocalist young and ambitious, 
Whose muse was decidedly good and propitious, 
He sialed for high honors and tuned his banjo, 
And nightly drew plaudits from the gods at the show. 
The fair sex admired him, he made conquests a 
score, 
The artists, too, laughed at his puns o'er and o'er, 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
CHORUS. 
The ballet girls adored him and stood in the wings, 
While he tuned his banjo and said funny things; 
But sad his misfortune and bitterest of pills, 
His name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
His fame kept increasing throughout all the land, 
And scores of new friends he shook by the hand, 
The dailies too praised him in articles long, 
For his manipulations of banjo and song. 
Then resolving to be in the profession a 
beau, 
He called on a 
tailor for a 
suit eomme-il faut, 
But the snip would not trust him or measure his limbs, 
For his name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, &c. 
He left his cheap lodgings, to a 
hotel did go, 
Determined to cut all acquaintances low, 
For to mix in high circles the elite of his clan, 
Was the principal hobby of this soaring young man. 
But the landlord being present gave him a 
sly glance, 
And politely demanded his board in advance, 
Get a 
line from the manager to secure us from ills, 
For your name isn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet girls, &c. 
A bewitching brunette did his senses entrance, 
His heart was a 
slave to her enraptured glance, 
He proposed, was refused, so to end all his woe, 
Packed his timings up at night, bade adieu to the show. 
And now o'er the sea in far distant climes. 
He wanders on loot plays his banjo and rhymes, 
For his country or home his heart never thrills, 
For his name wasn't large on the regular bills. 
The ballet, girls, Zte.

It happened very queerly, 
I

And as the train was starting, 
My wife called out, " Don't go about to see the sights in town." 
Of course I 
said, " Oh no, dear,. 
Without you ' twould be slow, dear, 
So, by the boat, on Saturday, you may expect me down."

week, they 
oughtn't to allow female women on board. 
The husband's boat, & c. 
We got in conversation. 
I 
stood a 
cold collation, 
We soon got near to Margate pier, the time went quickly by, 
Around her taper waist, then, 
My arm I 
just had placed, when 
I 
heard a 
voice that brought me to my senses instantly. 
Spoken.—" 0 
look, Ma! there's father—ain't it kind of him to bring 
your dress-maker with him on board."

My feelings won't bear painting, 
My wife with rage was fainting. 
I'll draw a 
veil upon a

entreat you, 
Your wives may come to meet you, 
Then take your arm away when you're in sight of Margate pier.

Indeed, I 
speak sincerely, 
I 
think you'd better t

Indeed I 
don't invent it, 
You may think that I 
meant it.

chanced to miss the train.

TURKEY RHUBARB. 
"Written and Composed by ROBERT COOMBS. 
I came here from Turkey because I'd been told, 
The ladies were handsome, so thought l'd be bold; 
Of cash I 
had plenty, and thought to do well, 
Ne'er dreaming that I, Turkey Rhubarb would sell. 
Now I, like the Sultan. the ladies adore, 
So thought ra him copy and marry a 
score ; 
I 
only succeeded in marrying ten, 
And they have all bolted with some other men. 
CIIORUS. 
Turkey rhubarb, Turkey rhubarb, Turkey rhubarb I 
sell, 
I 
came here from Turkey to make you all well ; 
Perhaps you den% know me, but my name is Dan, 
I 
am tie celebrated Turkey rhubarb man. 
One of my wives " rounded," declar'd me an elf, 
Said she'd have a 
husband, and all to herself ; 
I 
told her I 
loy'd her, but it was no go, 
She call'd a 
policeman, and let him to know ; 
He look'd with amazement, said I'd got a " cheek," 
And straightway he walked me before the old 
W ho said I'd committed a 
stupendous crime, 
To prison he sent me, and for a 
long time. 
Turkey rhubarb, &c. 
At the trial I 
pleaded I 
knew not the law, 
My counsel he tried hard to find out a 
flaw, 
And the hard-hearted judge, in spite of my grief, 
Said that a 
bigamist was worse than a 
thief; 
A verdict of guilty the jury soon found, 
And then I 
fell senseless right on to the ground; 
I 
was dooni'd in a 
jail ten years to remain, 
And not see my dear wives, no, not once again. 
Turkey rhubarb, Scc. 
'You've heard all my troubles, I 
hope you won't laugh, 
Nor tell other pe , ple, or else they may chaff; 
Advice I'll now give to all who would roam, 
Don't you do abroad what you would at home; 
Or else when in trouble, perhaps innocent quite, 
All the pity you'll get will be " Serv'd you well right !" 
My love for the ladies was my only sin,

I WANT TO GO HOME TO MANNA. 
Written and Composed by F. W. EgEwroN. 
Sung by MISS JEN.NIE ENGEL. 
I 
once had a 
sweetlieart—tho' her name was Brown, 
She was most decidedly green, 
But when you have seen her, you'll say she's as nice 
A young lady as ever was seen; 
And then she's so tunny, she's just like a 
child. 
She loy'd me, but much better far, 
She lov'd her dear parents for always she cried, 
1 
want to go home to Mamma. 
CHORUS. 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
I 
want to go home to Mamma, 
" 
It's naughty" I 
say " to keep me away, 
When I 
want to go home to Mamma." 
When first I 
beheld her, I 
thought what a 
dear, 
With joy, oh ! I 
nearly went wild, 
But when I 
began, to boo and to coo, 
Why she snivelled out like a 
child ; 
I 
thought she was ill, I 
could not make her out, 
When she jumped up and said, " Oh tat-ta." 
I 
said " pray don't go," when she cried out, " Oh! 
I 
want to go home to Mamma." 
I 
want to go home, &c, 
With lots of persuasion, and coaxing, and fuss, 
The worst job I've had in my life, 
I 
contrived to assure her I 
loved her so much, 
Till she said " that she'd be my wife ;" 
We drove to the church, when oh, what a 
scene I 
She would have the door left ajar, 
The clergyman said, " Will you wed," she shrieked out— 
., No, I 
want to go home to Mammal" 
I 
want to go home, &c. 
At last we were married, Oh ! my, what a 
job, 
To the continent then off we went, 
Pm happy to say, she her nervousness lost, 
When the honeymoon cosey we spent. 
So now she's so diffrent to what she once was, 
We're happy by night and by day, 
Her marriage she says " she will never repent." 
And never do I 
hear her say, ; 
want to go home, dre.

HERE'S A HEALTH TO ALL GOOD LASS:68. 
Here's a 
health to all good lasses, 
Pledge it merrily, fill your glasses, 
Let the bumper toast go round. 
May they live a 
life of pleasure, 
Without mixture, without measure, 
For with these true joys are found. 
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS. 
When the wind blows, 
Then the mill goes, 
Our hearts are all light and merry; 
When the wind drops. 
Then the mill stops, 
We'll drink and sing hey down derry. 
SHARE MY COTTAGE. 
The hawthorn with the woodbine twin'd, 
Present their sweets to thee, 
And every balmy breath of wind, 
Is filled with harmony, 
A truly fond and loving heart 
Is all I 
have for thee, 
Then can'st thou see me thus depart 
A prey to misery ? 
Oh, share, &c. 
Oh, share my cottage, gentle maid, 
it only waits for thee, 
Is gives a 
sweetness to its shade, 
And happiness to thee ; 
There from the splendid gay parade, 
Of noise and folly free, 
No sorrow can my peace invade, 
If only blest with thee. 
Oh, share, & c. 
THE DASHING YOUNG DAIRYMAN. 
AIR 
She danced like a 
fairy." 
Words by H. 
J. 
W YMARIC 
Music by H. DUDLEY. 
My love was a 
dairyman dapper and smart. 
As straight as a (tart, he quite won my heart, 
We vow'd from each other we never should part, 
But how it resulted 1'11 tell. 
The housemaids and cooks to the windows all ran, 
When daily his rounds he would go. 
Te catch a 
small glimpse of that charming young man, 
As sweetly he cried, " Milk below," 
He worked at a 
dairy and cried, " Milk below," 
In tones rich and slow, as round he would go; 
I 
never imagiu'd that he'd serve me so, 
Nor flirt in that manner with me. 
But seldom it is that you find one so young, 
With such a 
smooth tongue the milkmen aniong, 
Then, when for my hand a 
consent be had wrung, 
I 
lent him what money I'd saved. 
He said he intended no more to be " man," 
'But master himself he would be, 
And 'stead of henceforth being yoked to a 
can, 
41e hoped to be soon yoked to me. 
He work'd at a 
dairy, ei.o. 
Now when he became first acquainted with me, 
He'd nightly me see, bring cream for my tea; 
You'd think that a 
man who'd so generous be 
Would ne'er from his word go away. 
I 
thought so myself once, but sorry am I, 
To have to record it of him, 
r. 
He other girls treated ere three months went by, 
And only supplied me with " skim." 
He work'd at a 
dairy, &:4
-. 
u That he was a 
male flirt soon came to my ears, 
'Twas true, it appears, he called all girls ' dears," 
So that I 
should have a 
good ground for my fears, 
To watch him I 
made up my mind. 
The length of his beat I 
soon afterwards found, 
For one day while walking his chalks, 
His cans began leaking as he went his round. 
.And thus he went chalking his walks. 
Ho work'd at a 
dairy, &c. 
1 
Each house that be called at, there quite at his ease, 
The girls' hands he'd squeeze, which did them muck please, 
That losing my temper I 
was by degrees, 
And bade him to see me no more. 
Since that time I 
scorn all purveyors of milk, 
I 
never drink milk to my tea; 
I 
spurn all the whitewash of folks of that ilk, 
1fIone of this " chalk-mixture " for me. 
lie work'd in a 
dairy, Ice.

ANY ORNAMENTS :FOR YOUR FIR.E-STOVES ? 
My hopes alas! have blighted been, 
Most cruelly I've slighted been, 
My love has unrequited been, 
'rho' I 
can't tell why; 
My grief to you I 
will unfold, 
I 
lov'd a 
girl nineteen years old, 
Who round the streets tire-papers sold, 
And would her wares ery. 
Spoken.—Talk about girls ! she was a 
regular topper, and 
the very moment I 
behelu her I 
was quite spooney on her. 
But alas my hopes were doom'd to be blighted by- a 
viper 
that; cross'd my path, and robb'd me of the object of my 
nffeot ions, leaving me alone to mourn my loss. 
And when 
I 
Ihint: ot the happy hours she and I 
have pass'd together. 
my eyes open their flood-gates and the tears come rolling 
down my cheeks, falling on the floor with a 
noise resem-
bling a 
hail-storm ! Oh ! what an eestaey of bliss I 
was in 
the moment I 
used to hear her sweet voice crying— 
Any ornaments for your fire-stoves? 
For your fire-stoves? for your fire-stoves? 
Any ornaments for your fire-stoves? 
Was her daily cry. 
S':e swore that she would stick to me, 
Behave just like a 
brick to me, 
And why she play'd this trick to me, 
Of course .1 
can't tell ; 
To talk of marriage I 
began, 
She seem'd delighted at the plan, 
But, oh ! she wed another man, 
Not half such a 
swell. 
Spoken.—Yes, she gave me the cut direct and married a 
bather's boy. And when I 
cogitate, ruminate, think, study, 
ponder, and soliloquize. on NN•hat we might have been if 
this young shaver hadn't come across us, it drives me to 
distraction. 
When she turned Inc off, and took on with 
him, he ose'l to take all her bard earnings away from her. 
and treat her to trouers amid pease- pudding with her own 
money. Now I 
ally:13-s behaved like a 
gentleman to her, 
and s!e ii,ed to say to me. - Billy. my boy, when we get 
spliced, crit.dicy 
N‘on't we have a 
flare. up ! all the women 
will be jealous when they see as I've got such a 
husband 
as you; they'll pint at me and say, There she is,' while 1 
go crying—

ANY ORNAMENTS, &C.—CONCLUDED. 
Her husband was a 
cruel man, 
To turn quite cool he soon began, 
At last limn her away he l811, 
Amid ne'er more was seen; 
This was a 
settler to the biide, 
Who walk'd down to the river side, 
And there to end her life she tried, 
And did the job clean. 
Epoken,-1 was walking beside the river one morning, 
when my 
eyes fell on tto object which I 
thought I 
had seen 
before. 
I approached, when alt ! what do I behold 
There, in all her beauty lies my faithless lair, she has put 
an end to life by means of poison ! I 
perceive a 
paper on 
the ground, and, thinking it might be a 
letter to the en-
treating forgiveness, I 
raise it, but find it is no letter, but 
a 
Comic Songster ! but see ! she moves ! she actually gasps; 
I 
place my ear in close proximity to her lips! she is about 
to speak ! I 
listen I 
Is she going to crave pardon, or what 
With bated breath I 
anxiously await, when lo I 
her last 
dying words are— 
Any ornaments, &c. 
To tatters, my poor heart is torn, 
I 
feel so lonely and forlorn. 
I 
wish I 
never bad been born, 
And think I 
will (lie. 
I'd jump from off the Monument, 
But threepence would have to be spent! 
Could I 
some easy means invent— 
At once I 
would try. 
Spoken.—W

doctor's shop open, I 
would 
put an end to may miserable exist erce with : 111 mince of 
Epsom Salts, but. alas! they are all closed.

DIY SISTER DEAR. 
From the Opera of M ASSANIELLO.. 
My sister, dear, o'er this rude cheek, 
How oft I've felt the tear-drop stealing, 
When those mute looks have told the feeling ;

The Champagne I 
drank at last g-ot in my head ; 
When I 
started for home ( twas exceedingly late, 
Or early next morning) I 
couldn't walk straight, 
Fell asleep on a

spell, 
Then dreamt I 
was down in a

In a 
Diving, Bell. boys, underne 1th the sea, 
All amongst the fishes. Ito how jolly it must be, 
Along with sharks, and porpoises, mermaids too as well, 
It's something truly jolly to be down in a 
Diving Bell. 
Down, down we descended, the sea to explore, 
And nearly knocked over the Man at, the Nore; 
And all the strange monsters who lived in the deep, 
Came up from their dwellings to have a 
good peep. 
Still down, down we went, accomplished our aim, 
For soon to the bed of the ocean we came, 
King Neptune popped out, whilst the waves loudly roar, 
To enquire the state of the weather on shore.

Diving Bell, (kn. 
Our journey then o'er, to the bottom I 
mean, 
We had leisure to see all there was to seen, 
The k onders we saw, and the strange fishes too, 
Quite beat into fits all the sights in the " Zoo." 
Great hideous monsters, sea serpents, and whales, 
Canto swimming around us and wagging their tails, 
And bent on enjoying our journey from shore, 
Made love to the pretty mermaids by the score. 
In a 
Diving Bell, cte 
We started for home, were enjoying a 
smoke, 
When the chain we were hanging- by, suddenly broke, 
I 
thought I 
was thrown with great force on a

sound just like thunder accompanied the shock.

THE UPPER- TEN. 
Written, Composed and Sung by W. H. Lixo.taa. 
Like famous Jack Brag, that dashing blade, 
Who lived in be-gone days, 
Disg-usted with my father's trade, 
Mysej I 
sought to raise 
High in this fashionable world; 
So when my father died, then 
I 
spent the cash I'd earned by work, 
Amongst the upper ten. 
Spoken—Yes, the gov'nor kept an oil and color store ia 
Fulton Ptreet, but, of course, I 
never talked shop— 
CHORUS. 
When I 
belonged to the upper ten, 
The upper ten, the upper ten, 
Such handsome women and jolly men, 
We swells of the upper ten thousand. 
My style of dres., as you may see! 
Is always quite correct. 
Park loungers stop to look at me, 
My costume to inspect; 
"Whose that man's tailor ?” I 
oft hear 
Remarked by envious men; 
They took me for " ten thousand a 
year" 
Amongst the upper ten. 
When I 
belonged, 891 
But running short of cash I 
tried 
My fortune to recruit, 
By looking round me for a 
wife, 
And soon found one to snit; 
A 
lovely young Fifth Avenue belle, 
Rich, idolized by men, 
Oh, lucky chance by which I 
fell 
Amongst the upper ten. 
And she belonged, kbe 
She spoke about my family, 
'Twas rather awkward ground, 
For in Debrett my pedigree, 
Can not be be plainly found; 
But told her mine -was Norman blood, 
And satisfied, she then 
Said she'd be mine, and with me shine 
rImongst the upper ten. 
And we both belonged, 81s. 
One day, as ,ve bt..th down Broadway strolled, 
By chance met a 
friend, 
Who'd known me and my dad of old, 
His hand he did extend. 
a‘ How's business, what's the price of oiler 
Ile shouted out, and then 
felt it was all up with me, 
Amoncrst the upper ten. 
Spolce*—Tt ruined me; and you shr,uld have seen her, as, 
&the looked into my face, her.eyes flas•tin4 rire,and all,that sort 
of thing, she said— 
I 
thought you belonged, 8c.c.

And how changed, alas! each well-remembered scene, 
Since you and I

Alas! you never more will smile on me— 
And life is now a

I

'While walking one morning in Regent Street, 
A handsome young fellow I 
chane'd to meet, 
He walled up to me wita a 
smile so sweet, 
And these words to me then did say : 
" 
My charmer, you're handsome beyond a 
doubt, 
Pray raise that thick fall, Miss, and do not pout, 
Then, perhaps. on next Sunday, I'll take you out, 
To Greenwich we'll go for the (lay." 
Fair, fair, with curly hair, 
Beard and moustache did alike compare, 
lie look'd like an Emperor, I 
declare, 
Beautiful, beautiful swell. 
He promised to wed, and his name was Brown, 
And he'd a 
nice villa in Camden town, 
Then ask'd if I 
kindly coald lend a " crown," 
And freely of course I 
complied. 
And when he obtained it, he said: 
" 
My dear, I'm sorry to leave you, but -must, I 
fear, 
But to- morrow, at eight, I 
will meet you bere, ,, 
Then hastou'd away from my side.

Now-, 
when he'd departed I 
felt so lone 
For dearly I 
loved that young man, I'll own, 
Such hearty affection for me he'd shown, 
I 
never thought he would prove untrue. 
hasten'd to where we'd arranged to meet. 
My heart, like a 
pendulum quick did beat, 
I 
patiently paced lip and down the street, 
But still he was nowhere in view! 
Fair, fair, Sze. 
Two hours I 
waited, and heard " Big Ben," 
With sonorous tones, strike the hour often, 
Ile came not, I 
called him the basest of men, 
Ant nothing II1V passion could quell. 
The Holborn Casino I 
ehanc'd to pass, 
And just going in there, as bold as brass, 
Mauve gloves on his bands. on each arm a 
lass, 
I 
saw this maumuvering swell!

Of course to my feelings I 
gave free vent,

was frilly bent. 
I 
asked for the five shillings that I'd lent. 
When into deep laughter be fell. 
I 
said for the money I

if you'll list-
 en, I 
will stateWhat I've seen when I've been dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
race-course, 
And a 
crowd assembled there, 
To watch each noble race-horse 
As towards the post they tear; 
I 
dreamt there was no welching— 
But all were acting fair, 
And I 
thought there was no filching 
Or card-sharping, I 
declare 
Well, soon the race it did begin, 
The colors they were streaming, 
And I 
thought each jockey tried to win— 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I KNEW THAT I WAS DIZEASIIING.-LCoNCruDitD.1 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
postman 
Who was hurrying on his rounds, 
Of letters he'd a 
host, man, 
And so nimbly on he bounds :— 
I 
thought it just struck eight o'clock, 
The maid the steps was cleaning, 
And I 
thought he gave a 
gentle knock—, 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming ; 
He was so curiously arrayed, 
The buttons bright were gleaming, 
And some one said he was well paid— 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw an area gate, 
And a 
Bobby standing near,— 
A servant-maid, with mincing gait, 
Come forth to fetch some beer; 
I 
saw him kiss her on the sly, 
So lifelike it was seeming— 
But when he refused some rabbit-pie, 
Then I 
knew that I 
was dreaming: 
A 
row commenced close by there, when 
For police they loud were screaming. 
He came when he was wanted— 
Then I 
knew I 
must be dreaming. 
I 
dreamt I 
saw a 
music-hall, 
And a 
waiter, on his way 
To serve some gent within the stalls 
With something on a 
tray; 
I 
saw him hand politely 
The glass with liquor streaming, 
But he went away without the fee— 
Then I 
knew I 
must he dreaming. 
I 
thought that every comic song 
Was full of wit and meaning,— 
I 
felt convinced that I 
was wrong, 
And knew that I 
was dreaming.

THE LOVING POSTMAN ; OR, HIS HEART 
WEN'r FIT-A-PAT. 
I 
tell of a 
lass, nani'd Mary Day, 
A sery , nt up the West End way. 
Who lov'd a 
postman, I've heard say, 
Who brought the letters to the door, 
How speedily up stairs she strode, 
When she saw bile coming down the road, 
Her countenance such joy it $ ow'd, 
When she answered him at the door. 
CHORUS. 
His heart always went pit- a- pat, 
And hers too, at his loud rat- tat, 
ills heart went always pit- a-pat, 
Whenever hc knock'd at t..e door. 
Joe-Jenkins was the postman's name, 
With Mary he in love became, 
To him hers was his littie game, 
Each day he loved her more. 
The' he call ' d 
forty times a 
day, 
lIe301.1lt muster pluck to say. 
" 
I 
love you dearly, Mary Day," 
lie only press'd her hand at the door. 
Ills heart, 140. 
Now Joe was anything but a 
fool, 
And 
said, when he'd teought out cool, 
'• Why I 
shou'd not wri to there's no rule, 
At once to Mvary Day, 
And say I 
pining am away." 
So he did, and post/el the note straightway, 
And delivered it himself that day, 
With other letters to Miss Day. [ His heart, & c. 
And when that letter Mary read, 
If she stood on her heels or head, 
She hardly knew but up- stairs sped, 
Aiia read it times it score. 
She almost fainted right away, 
For the postman he -went on to say, 
He hoped she'd speak the following day, 
When he came with letters to the door. 
His heart, &e. 
The very next day when he called there, 
lie saw he'd no cause to despair, 
And said, " I 
love you true. In 
fair, 
Anil shall always you adore." 
Then ansiver'd hie shin g 
Mary Day, 
" 
I've only got this much to say, 
I 
love you and will name the day, 
Next time you come in tier door." [H is heart, &a. 
And so they settled it then and there, 
They constancy to each did swear, 
she smootti'd her crinoliee and back hair, 
When he went from the door. 
And they were lvedlied I've I 
eard so, 
The' that may he some years ago, 
Still he causes her no grief or woe, 
They but ii each other do adore. 
And always her heart heats pit- a-pat, 
To bear her spouse's rat- tat- tat, 
And his heart, toe, goes pit- a-pat, 
Whenever he's knocking at the door.
