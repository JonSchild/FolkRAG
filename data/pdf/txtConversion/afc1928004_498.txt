Original, by W ILLIAMS and SULLY. 
Oh, here I 
am, a 
gallus nig, 
travel on my shape ; 
I 
was born in Alabama, 
Down by the old cane brake. 
Old massa used to wollop me, 
And away f in him I 
ran ; 
So, white folks, watch the motion 
Of this lively Black and Tan. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, here I 
am, a 
gallus fig, 
I 
travel on my shape; 
I 
was born in Alabama, 
Down by the old cane brake. 
And when at dancing I 
do go, 
The wenches at me stare ; 
They say he would make quite a 
beau, 
With nice black curly hair. 
And when to dance I 
do begin, 
The wenches round me stand, 
To watch the evolution of 
This happy Black and Tan. 
Oh, here I 
am, &c. 
Now, kind friends I 
must say good-bye, 
For I 
must quickly go ; 
There's a 
little wench a 
waiting, 
A 
couple of doors below. 
She says that I

I 
know it is no sham, 
Beu.use she's captivated with

No Need of Putting On Airs. 
As sung with great success by Miss N ELLIE GERMON. 
Supposing you are the possessor 
Of a 
little more money than I, 
Pray tell me is that any reason 
Why you should hold your head up so high ? 
Is a 
man to be judged by his money, 
His coat, or the proud name he bears ? 
No, indeed ; it is worth tells the story, 
So there's no need of putting on airs, 
CHORUS. 
Then take the advice that I 
give you, 
Come down from your perch on the stairs, 
Shake warmly the hand that is honest, 
For there's no need of putting on airs. 
For it's a 
long lane that hasn't a 
turning, 
And perhaps a 
Dame Fortune may frown; 
Banks burst and cashiers skedaddle, 
And those that are up may go down. 
Then for those who to us have been lofty, 
And turned up their noses, who cares ? 
What has been may happen again. sirs, 
So there's no need of putting on airs 
Then take the advice, &cr. 
Ann Eliza. 
Sung with tremendous success by W ILLIAMS and SULLY at the Howard 
Atheneum, Boston. 
Oh, I 
just come down to see my Lize, 
Oh, far you well ; 
To tell her dat I'm gwine away.. 
All, far you well ; 
If she was here, she might go, too, 
Oh, far you well ; 
Oh, to my love I 
will be true, 
Ah, far you well. 
CHORUS. 
Good-bye, Ann Eliza, 
We'll never meet again ; 
For I'm going back to Dixie's Land, 
Whar dey hoe dat sugar cane. 
[REPEAT.] 
SHE.— 
What's dat, Josh, I

You ain't g.-inc away to leave me now ?

Then come, my love, and go with me,

Two soldier from ould Ireland, 
As happy a., can be. 
And soon we'll have to leave you, 
For we have to join our band, 
For here we are two warriors bold, 
Two of the Connaught Band. 
And soon we'll have to join the ranks, 
And to the front we'll go; 
And walk up to it like warriors bold, 
It's there we'll meet the foe. 
For drilling and for fighting 
We're known all through the land. 
As you can see we are two braves, 
Two of the Connaught Band.

Composed by W. J. SULLY, and sung with great success by WILLIAMS

Kind folks, listen to us now. 
We'll sing to you a 
song 
About the good time that we had 
So early in the morn. 
Away down Virginny State 
Us darkie.; we were born, 
And if from us they'll take the cake, 
They'll have to husk the corn. 
But soon we'll have to leave you, 
We cannot stay, oh no, 
But hope you will excu ,e 
This happy Pete and Flo. 
CHORUS. 
Arm in arm together, 
So merrily we go, 
To jine our good old massa, 
Will dis happy Pete and Flo. 
When our day's work it was done, 
Then we had our fun ; 
Our massa he would wollop us, 
And then we'd have to run. 
But now that we have been away, 
We're gwine back once more, 
To see our good ole massa, 
Will this happy Pete and Flo. 
But now we'll have to leave you, 
We cannot stay, oh no; 
We're gwine way back to Dixie, 
Whar the sugar cane does grow. 
Arm in arm together, &c. 
Alabama Lou. 
Composed by W. J. SULLY, and sung by WILLIAMS and SULLY. 
Oh, I've just come here to see my gal, I 
love her, too, quite well, 
She lives in yonder cottage, and with her I 
must dwell. 
She is handsome, fair and beautiful, so gentle and so tall, 
In fact she takes the shine away from all. 
We met one fine day, it was in the month of May, 
While leisurely meandering the festive gay Broadway. 
She winked at me, I 
winked at her, and next day was to meet 
This charmer with the pretty little feet. 
CHORUS. 
My Lou ! 
My Lou! 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
She is the prettiest girl I 
ever knew. 
I 
love her to destraction, 
That's a 
heap of satisfaction, 
My sweet, my charming Alabama Lou. 
I 
wonder who that was that just came in that gate, 
I 
wonder if it was that handsome darkey Pete ? 
I 
met him only yesterday while walking down Proadway, 
And he has been taking liberty to follow me all de way. 
I 
only wish he'd waited until I 
had come out; 
He'd make me feel so happy by taking a 
little walk, 
But now he's gone and won't come back, I_don't know what 
I'll do, 
While waiting for my charming little Pete. 
ALABAMA LOU—Continued. 
CHORUS. 
My Pete ! 
My Pete I 
(Sym.) 
(Sym.) 
He is as handsome as you would want to meet. 
I 
love him to destraction, 
That's a 
heap of satisfaction, 
My sweet, my charming Alabama Pete. 
Good evening, Lou, we've met again, 
And now before we part 
I 
wish to pop the question— 
I 
do with all my heart. 
SHE— 
Well, what is it, Pete, go on and speak, 
I'll listen with all my heart 
To what you have to say, 
My charming Pete. 
Will you be my wife ? 
That's what I

And let's Jine hands 
And a

And happy we will be,

A 
living in our little Southern home.

,7^ 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in the N. 
Herald, called the "Complaint Book," written by TONY 
PASTOR, and sung by FRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, Pittsburg. 
Of course in search of novelties are people now-a- days, 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald " Complaint 
Book." 
SPOKEN.—This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
I 
fonnd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will I 
show the rascal up in the Herald " Complaint Book'?" 
SPOKEN.—In regards to the stage— 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, aud an answer I 
expect, 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the regged urchins on the street they quietly overlook, 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down ex 
the book. 
SPOKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have neither 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can look, 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Complaint 
Book?"

Now Moses being my christian name, I 
used to feel afraid, 
And dreading something awful I 
for hours awake have laid, 
Sometimes I'd cry myself to sleep but. horrid things I 
dreamed, 
For naughty ghosts at my bedside glared at me while they 
screamed: 
Cao:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c. 
• Upon the nurse I 
split and she was kindly asked to leave, 
But Moses Mit,(g.
,gins married her for which we did not grieve, 
g 
I 
met her in the street when she had just two days been wed, 
r 
And didn't she warm my jacket when I 
innocently said: 
Cuo:—Where was Moses when the light went out, & c. 
4. 
Some twenty years passed by before I 
heard the phrase again, 
Alone with a 
young lady I 
was ruling in the train, 
We rushed into a 
tunnel and when all was pitchy dark, 
My lively little lady friend gave vent to this remark: 
CH0:—Where was Moses when the light went out, & c. 
5. 
Now when once more the lbrht of day we saw to her I 
said, 
As you've ' waken'd up old memories you're the girl I'd like to 
wed, 
We're married now and six fine boys amuse us every night, 
And they never fail to ask when their Pa puts out the light: 
Cno:—Where was Moses when the light went out, &c. 
DO NOT I.U.KN ME FROM YOUR DOOR.

OFF YOUR .NUT.* 
Written and composed by SAM lisrzait. 
AS bye-words now are all the go, I'm going to give you one, 
It's used by all, both large and small, you'iL hear it on every 
tongue, 
An urchin toils you in the street with " Mister, shine 'em up ?" 
H wants ten cents, you offer him five, he says, '
Cully, you're 
off your nut.' 
A 
carriage, a 
carriage, a 
hackman cries, till his face gets awful 
red. 
He's anxious to make a 
dollar or two before he goes to bed; 
You ask him to drive you around the town and Ian 1 
3 
ott right 
side up, 
He winks his eye at his pal. so sly, saying " That roster is off 
Ids nut " 
Thare's y 
ur German tailor too, who, makes such stylish 
clot hi 
What would we do without the lean,, why surely nobody 
knows; 
He mak s ou a 
suit that's ha d 
to beat, the latest Parisian 
cut, 
If you te I 
him you'll pay in a 
weeg he'll say, " I 
don't got oil 
my nut." 
If on the street you chance to meet a 
friend who has been on a 
spree, 
ills hat smashed in, his head swelled up, a 
real old " jam-
boree; ' 
His clothes are soiled, he's got the shakes, perhaps he's bruised 
and Cot, 
lie says, - You know how it is yourself, I'm a 
little off my 
nut." 
Now friends if you'll take my advice, it may do you some 
good. 
I 
woul Wt. advise you wrongully, nor wouldn't if I 
could, 
Don't drink too much or stay out nights or you never will hare 
any luck, 
You'll ruin your elf 13 both cash and health and go clean off 
your nut. 
* 
This " Off Your Nut" has been a 
bye-word here for some time; 
that is it means gone out of your head or cranky, something of that 
mart.

Loots I 
left down in the hall, 
Aid softly I 
crept up the stairs; 
I 
kept rather close to the wall, 
And thought to ascend unawares; 
But just as I 
got to the door, 
I 
seemed to get lost in the dark; 
I 
stumbled and fell on the floor, 
And just then I 
could only remark—

She sobbed and she wept and she screamed, 
An,d said she'd go back to her Na;

And tried to enjoy my cigar.

The Day When You'll Forget Me.

Music by J. R. THOMAS. 
As sung by JENNIE MonDA21. 
Nri.nele to be had of OLIVER DITSON & 
Co., Boston, Mass., Priee 400th. 
You call me sweet and tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses, 
And all the while my happy heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
You love me in your tender way, 
I 
answer as you let me ; 
But ah! there comes another day, 
The day when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me. 
I 
know that ev'ry fleeting hour 
Is marked by thoughts I 
bring you, 
I 
know there dwells a 
subtle pow'r 
In the sweet songs I 
sing you. 
I 
do not fear the darkest way, 
With those dear arms about me, 
Ah! no, I 
only dread the day 
When you can live without me, 
When you can live without me. 
And still you call me tender names, 
And softly smooth my tresses ; 
And still my happy answ'ring heart 
Beats time to your caresses. 
Hush! let me put that touch away, 
And clasp your hands above me ; 
So while I 
ask to die that day, 
The day you will not love me, 
The day you will not love me. 
You need not check the thoughts that ris• 
With darkness wrapt about them, 
For gazing in your earnest eyes, 
My heart can almost doubt them. 
Yet hush my whispers as you may, 
Such chidings do not fret me; 
Ah! no, I 
only fear that day, 
The clay when you'll forget me, 
The day when you'll forget me.

GOLDEN SHOWER. 
Written and composed by DAN SULLY. 
As sung with immense success by EMMA DEZODA. 
'Twas a 
pleasant morn in Spring, 
When the birds began to sing, 
And the flowers with their perfume filled the air; 
Carelessly I 
went along, 
Singing snatches from a 
song, 
When I 
espied a 
maid with a 
head of golden hair. 
She bestowed on me a 
smile, 
Fascinating all the while, 
And in her hand she held a 
little flower; 
Which she pinned upon my breast, 
And you can guess the rest, 
And I 
called her then my little golden shower. 
CHORUS. 
She's the angel of my dreams, (
Syn-c.) 
Her eye so loving beams, 
(Sym.) 
Oh my she looked so gay, 
Like a 
little sunny ray. 
And I 
called her then my little golden shower. 
She said I 
will be thine, 
Then she put her hand in mine, 
And she softly laid her head upon my breast; 
I 
was in a 
whirl of bliss, 
When I 
asked her for a 
kiss, 
And her rosy lips to mine she shyly pressed. 
I 
clasped her in my arms, 
And I 
gloried in her charms, 
Which put me in a 
heaven of delight; 
And now I 
am her beau, 
And in the little church below, 
We'll married be just a 
week to-night.

Way down in good old Georgia, 
The place where I 
was born, 
In that rosy, sunny country 
Where I 
used to hoe the corn. 
In childhood's happy moments 
With spirits light and gay, 
I 
long to see my birthplace, 
For I 
couldn't stay away. 
CHORUS. 
I'm travelling back, I'm traveling back, 
I'm traveling night and day, oh. 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
I'm traveling all the way, 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, for 
I 
couldn't stay away. 
I 
once did love a 
fair one, 
Way down in Dixie's land. 
'Twas there I 
popped the question, 
I 
asked her heart and hand. 
She said her heart and hand were won, 
So from me she did stray, 
My heart is broke and so am I 
But I 
couldn't stay away. 
I'm traveling, etc. 
But gince that time she tells me 
The other coon she's shook, 
The pen and ink she took in hand 
And scratched him from her book. 
My name she wrote upon the page, 
Which makes me feel so gay, 
If you won't grieve I'll take my leave 
For I 
cannot stay -away. 
I'm traveling, etc.

I 
think she knew it well,

From off the grassy ground;

On one corner then I

But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I

When the sunbeams kiss the flowers, 
And the song birds sing in glee, 
Making sweet the passing hours, 
Then my darling waits for me; 
Little lov'd ones run to meet me,

At the door sweet smiles will greet me,

Bless our home, and all its treasures, 
Cheer our sorrows when they come,

And my weary heart is sad, 
Sweetest voices then are calling, 
Making music pure and glad; 
Oh! they charm away my sorrow, 
Smooth my path where'er I

Not one cloud can dim the morrow,

Bless our horavi &o.

There is Heaven on earth for me; 
While the sands of life are gliding, 
Sweetest blessings there I

May those blessings live forever, 
Keep the wolf from out the door. 
Welcome be each friend, and never 
May our hearts forget the poor.

ON BROADWAY. 
tVords by George L. Stoute, and expressly adapted to the air 
of "Piccadilly for Miss Jennie Hughes,. 
You talk about your languid swells 
Who Central Park parade; 
But there's a 
gent, i know right well, 
Who throws them in the shade ; 
But where he lives or what's his name. 
I 
do not wish to say, 
Itut the first time that I 
met this gent, 
'Twas on the gay Broadway. 
CHORUS. 
On Broadway, on Broadway, 
For elegant swells, and the fairest of Belles: 
On Broadway, On Broadway, 
That's where I 
am seen when in town, 
This handsome gent T 
sing about, 
This dashing Broadway swell, 
Has pearly tt‘eth and deep blue eyes, 
And Blonde moustache as well; 
And like Adonis is his form, 
He always dresses gay, 
With a ' lobby air and curly hair, 
He walks in gay Broadway, 
I 
meet him at the matinee, 
And much do him admire, 
But when he looks me in the face, 
I 
think I 
shall expire; 
At the Comique he buy's a 
chair; 
But more I 
dare not say. 
Of course you know the Cornique is 
Five fourteen Broadway.

I 
TOOK my love one evening, 
When the summer moon was beaming, 
Thro' the silent arbors gleaming, 
Where cupid has control. 
I 
wanted to tell her, 
how dearly I 
adored her; 
But Oh! she wouldn't listen, 
Tho' I 
tenderly implor'd her, 
Ohl love, oh! love, why don't you heed me. 
How can you treat me so. 
In vain, in vain, in vain, 
She heeded not my pain, 
She turn'd away her head, 
And this was all she said. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! ain't you awful, 
It's wrong you know, to love me so, 
Yes you are awful, 
Your like I 
ne'er did see; 
Oh ! ain't you awful, 
It's wrong you know, to love me so,-
Dear me you're horrid, 
Why don't you let me be. 
To make my feelings clearer, 
I 
advanced a 
little nearer, 
And said I'd like to see her, 
Say yes and ease my mind, 
She fumbled and mumbled, 
And laughed at my attention; 
She said mamma woul I 
scold her, 
If such things she dared to : nentie:..-, 
Come love I 
cried we'll run away, 
And leave your mamma behind, 
Oh no, oh no, she sald, 
Don't ask ire now to wed, 
What would the people say, 
If we should run away? 
Oh! ain't you aaFtei. 
She talk'd Gil useless matters. 
Till my patience was in tatters, 
Just as a 
woman clatters, 
Whe:i silent she should be, 
I 
begg'd her to listen, 
And drew her close beside mo; 
But she began to fidget, 
And her roguish eyes defied me, 
And soon she told me with a 
nage 
That she did not care for me, 
My love was all in vain, 
She heeded not may pain, 
She turned away her head, 
And this was all she said.

SALLY, BLESS MY SOUL !

I 
should like to know the reason why 
As I 
go down the street, 
There is a 
twinkle in the eye 
Of every girl I 
meet. 
1 
ask'd my Cousin Sally once, 
Why it was she smiled so sweet ? 
She says I 
am a 
perfect dunce— 
They're laughing at your feet ! 
CHORUS. 
I 
blushed and bowed my head with grief. 
My anguish to control ; 
And said, whm I 
could catch my breath, 
Oh, Sally, bless my soul ! 
Of all the talent I 
poss'ess, 
Those feet they are my pride ; 
They are good size, and cost me less 
To walk with than to ride ; 
They always take me out of town 
As fast as I 
can go ! 
And Sally fills me with alarm, 
By talking to me so. 
I 
blushed, ttc, 
Now I've resolved to search this town, 
Some smaller shoes to try; 
That will not draw the glances down 
Of every passer by. 
I'll get a 
smaller pair, I 
vow, 
And dress up in the style! 
And when I 
meet my love, I'll bow 
And raise my Harvard tile !

My heart has room, my heart has room for thee 
I've seen bright eyes in stranger climes. 
I've heard sweet words divine, 
I've looked upon their beauty oft, 
But none I've seen like thine. 
Come, say that you will be my love, 
Say that my bride you'll be;

VIOLETS DIPPED IN DEW 
Words and Music by W. H. DELEHANTI 
As I 
strolled out one evening, 
The Sun had just gone dowh, 
While leisurely meandering 
A 
little way from town ; 
I 
there beheld a 
damsel 
With eyes the brightest blue% 
Beneath her dark eye-lashes, 
Like Violets dipped in dew. 
CHORUS. 
A 
smile was all she gave me, ( Syrup-
That how it did em-lave me,

s,..nk,wed on behind her, 
I 
think she knew it well, 
And as a 
sweet remainder, 
Her handktrchief it fell ; 
1 
raised the scented linen 
From off the grassy ground; 
Her name, in letters crimson, 
On one coriter there 1 
found,. 
CHORUS. 
She deigned to smile upon me, (Symph.) 
That moment she had won me, 
My heart it pierced me through 
There's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue ; 
A 
dreamy soft expression, 
Like yiolets dipped in dew. 
At length I 
did approach her, 
And ventured into talk, 
By asking her permission 
To join her lonely walk ; 
She blushing, frowning, smiling, 
Said; ' Oh I 
I 
think you're rude ;" 
But those blue eyes, beguiling, 
Seemed to say, I 
wish you would. 
CHORUS. 
So arm in arm we wandered, 
'es, side by side meandered, 
And told our love tales too. 
&here's some sweet charm entrancing, 
Within her eyes so blue,

Like Violets dipped in dew.

DON'T DO THAT AGAIN. 
By ANDY MCKEE. 
Oh, we 've just come down, 
To have a 
look around, 
For to see the sights 
And then we're homes ard bound. 
For we're a 
happy pair, 
And I 
know you will declare, 
Another such a 
couple can't be found. 
While on the streets 
6O ninny sights we see, 
And it seems so strange that people all agree 
That we really cut a 
dash 
When we're out upon the mash, 
And just the style to suit you to a 
T. 
CHORUS. 
My oh, me oh, don't we look so gay, 
Watch us or we'll throw ourselves away. 
Duet. 
Oh, how fondly, dear, I 
love you, 
You don't love in vain, 
You told me oft about my rival--
Don't do that again. 
Now before we leave, 
And say to you good-bye, 
We hope and pray 
That you won't heave a 
sigh; 
For we'll return again. 
And on us you can depend, 
To make you laugh so much 
That you will cry. 
Next Sunday you will hear the marriage bell, 
Then unto you the secrets we will tell, 
We'll be no longer two, but stuck as tight as glue, 
Then we'll sing and dance till the day wo die.

SUNNY LAND. 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
By COTTON & BIRDUE. 
When we were together, in that sunny land, 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd wander through the cotton fields, 
And hear the Jay- bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At evening, when the boys were on the grees, 
We'd join them in the festive dance ! 
CHORUS. 
Gay and milling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have, 
Down in that sunny land! 
When we were a 
courting Poll and Bess, 
Down in that sunny land ; 
We'd take them rowing on the Lake, 
Or strolling on the strand ; 
We'd take the old Banjo, 
And together we would go 
And stay until the break of day ! 
We wish those happy, happy days 
Had never passed away. 
CHORUS. 
Gay and smiling ! 
Hours beguiling ! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have, 
Down in our sunny land!

cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bail habit of `• flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
where to do it,'' and this little volume would advise and initiate lb etitt-
corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
The N. Y. Evening Telegram writes: " We have lately seen a 
neat tittle 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing twenty-five cents, called the 
Little Flirt," published by A. J. 
FISHER, No. 98 Nassau Street. 
It 
gives information of the modus operandi of flirting, and of the mean-
ing of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As 
there is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents

afford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to 
recommend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
