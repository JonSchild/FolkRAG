What is the connection between 
the dance group and health

When we want to help others, there is not 
just one way. It is important to bring 
happiness and laughter to the people. Lots of 
ways to get to people. Happiness is 
important for the health of the people 
9:48 
Thinking about all the ways 
people are healthy 
The integration of health, happiness, social 
connection to others 
10:50 
Who are you primarily serving 
and where  
It is not only in one place. She attended a 
meeting in a Bronx Church. She was 
approached by a woman who needed help at 
10 p.m. She never turned someone away. 
Mostly she is in Peekskill. She knows the 
community and they know her. 
13:20 
How do you develop trust, who 
is your community 
She serves many people, on the streets, in 
the stores, in the churches. For example, 
today people needed to know about the 
vaccine. All people in Peekskill are her 
community. 
14:23 
Do you give out your personal 
cell phone?  
No. She does her job to give information, but 
her cell phone number is not for everyone 
15:20 
Building trust between the 
community members and the 
institutions.  
Not difficult for her because it is her job to 
bring her happiness and love. Easy to talk to 
people. Being authentic is easy and people 
recognize it. Her personality jives with the 
community and job. She thinks her spirit 
opens her heart to work and people sense it. 
 
 
Right now COVID stopped a lot of activity. 
Years ago, we started to use the SMART 
form to collect information. The promotoras 
have training on how to connect to others.  
 
 
One beautiful activity. Some people don’t 
have information about their health or annual 
physical. When we work at the laundromat, 
we talk to people there, everybody says no, I 
don’t have time, I have to work. She tells 
them I can help you, I can make an 
appointment for you. The promotoras make it 
easy for people to see the doctor. 
24:25 
The laundromat is such a good 
place. What are the other places 
you go to connect with people?  
On the street, they know about the health 
center but they don’t have jobs or homes. 
We talk about the services such as Pathway 
for alcoholics. We have many services for 
people that people don’t know about.  
 
 
Many people know or are already patients. 
With another co-worker we do workshops 
about diabete. There is a blood pressure 
clinic.  
 
 
Activities in the churches about blood 
pressure, diabetes, etc.  
 
We also have a table at the Farmer’s Market 
and we can talk about nutrition and diabetes. 
 
30:14 
There are formal ways to reach 
out to the people, are there 
informal ways to reach out. 
She doesn’t like to stay put. She will walk 
around and ask people if we can explain the 
services. 
 
 
Supermarket. We have tables there. Do 
blood pressure and such. We have small 
gifts for the people. 
34:36 
Vilma mentioned you work with 
day laborers and health 
promotion  
The uniform is very important. Some people 
stay close to the clock. We ask them how 
long they are here and if they have a doctor. 
She can help to get an appointment. If you 
don’t have money, we can help you. We 
connect them to services. 
37:10 
Do you go to companies to tell 
the employees about health 
services?  
We don’t go to companies but rather 
churches and such. La Parada is where men 
gather to get day work. We will go there.  
 
 
Sometimes we bring Comite Latino and 
provide services (not necessarily health)to 
the people.  
39:17 
Training, what was it like 
We have many trainings. For Rosana it is a 
review. CPR, blood training, Training on how 
to talk to others. Diabetes, many diseases. 
40:35 
What are some of the activities 
that you created for health 
promotion?  
She likes to play basketball and to walk. She 
got the idea to go to the park and play 
basketball and talk about health.  
 
 
There is a building where only people 65 and 
older live. Many of the people are sad and 
alone. I would like to teach Zumba there. And 
it has worked out.  
45:49 
Full time job 
She works as a health aid and nursing 
assistant in a nursing home.  
 
 
Promotora is a volunteer position 
47:12 
Biggest challenges as a 
The biggest challenge is that people say they 
promotora 
don’t have time.  
49:32 
Successes?  
Her jobs cross over. Her heart is always 
open at both jobs. She brings everything that 
the person needs.  
 
 
Her husband is a saint and understands that 
she might have to be late.  
54:24 
Directing people to other kinds of 
public services: transportation, 
legal services, etc.  
She is able to direct people to a variety of 
services 
 
Several stories about helping people. 
Related to the topic of directing people to 
public services. 
1:01:13 
Helped to develop Three Kings 
(Tres Reyes) 
Tres Reyes, different plays  and health 
promotions, toys for the children. Find the 
gifts and wrap them. And put in age groups. 
It is beautiful but a lot of work. Always find 
the baby Jesus from the new babies in the 
area. 
Beason, Poughkeepsie, an Peekskill 
 
 
Not really. It is time for recreation and for the 
children. There might be a table to explain 
services, another to take blood pressure and 
another with gifts for the children.  
1:10:48 
When is your identity as 
Colombian helpful to your work 
as a promotora 
No, my character and personality is more 
important than my cultural origins. She is 
very transparent.  
 
You approach the world through 
your heart. 
She just does. Doesn’t need a thank you.  
 
1:14:10 
Your service to the community is 
remarkable. And as a volunteer. 
All the promotoras who 
volunteer. And that you can save 
lives with your time.  
One hour, two hours can make a difference. 
For example, the Zumba is an hour where 
people can forget their problems.  
1:15:48 
The walking group as well.  
One woman was having trouble (a patient 
from the Health Center) with arthritis, 
headaches and other excuses. Rosana had 
an answer for all her excuses. Rosana got 
her to try it for one day. And now the woman 
walks all the time and even plays basketball. 
Important to connect and stimulate.  
1:20:00 
Do you live in Peekskill?  
She lives in Croton. Peekskill is her house. 
She is the director for the station of the 
Cross. She has 200 people who volunteer for 
it. Dinner may be at 11 or 11:30. It is worth it. 
The men respect her and it is very very good. 
She has a beautiful children’ choir. She is 
also the director of the dance group.  
 
 
She dances cumbia, salsa, merengue. 
Whatever is playing. (she gets up to dance) 
1:27:30 
 
In all her work she is kind and humanitarian 
towards her patients - she recognizes them 
as individuals not just as patients.  
 
It breaks her heart when the doctors are cold 
toward the patients. When we are patient it is 
very hard. Or are left alone because family 
and friends don’t visit. Or there is too much 
rigidity in a schedule that does not allow for 
variation such as when to go to the 
bathroom.
