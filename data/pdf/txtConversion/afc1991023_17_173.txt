and the post-fieldwork. 
inventory 
(assisted 
by Elaine Thatcher). 
A summary 
of 
these 
responsibilities follows. 
3. 
Logistics. One of the primary concerns during the month prior 
to 
the arrival of the fieldworkers in mid-September, 
1583, 
was 
making 
arrangements for office space and housing in New 
Jersey. 
Several 
site visits by Mary and Sue resulted in the decision 
to 
accept 
offers of assistance from two New Jersey state 
agencies. 
The 
former superintendent's cottage in Lebanon State Forest 
was 
2 
offered by the Department of Environmental Protection. 
It housed 
two 
of 
the fieldworkers (Sue and Elaine) while 
the 
downstairs> 
rooms 
were 
used 
for 
the 
project 
office, 
computer 
room, 
a 
miscellaneous 
workroom, 
and a kitchen that served as 
the 
maim 
social 
center. 
Furnishings 
were 
provided by 
the 
New 
Lisbon 
Developmental Center (Department of Human Services) , a school for -, 
the 
mentally retarded located 
 just across the road. 
They issued 
beds, 
chairs, 
tables, 
desks, 
and 
couches and 
also 
provided 
apartment 
space for the nether fieldworkers. 
These accomodations 
were 
a short 
walk from the 
project 
headquarters. 
Each 
unit 
consisted 
of 
two bedrooms (with private 
entrances) 
sharing 
a 
bathroom and small kitchenette. The project was a 
1 
l 
a 
tt ed 10 rooms; 
Jens, 
Joseph, 
Mary, 
Nora, Christine, Donnie, Mal, and Tore were 
given permanent assignments. The remaining two rooms were used tat 
house 
visitors 
from 
Washington 
(Carl, 
Jay, 
Alan 
Jabbour), 
reporters, and consultants. 
Several 
problems arose with the living arrangements. 
There 
was very little privacy for Elaine and I although our 'colleagues-
did 
try to limit noisy activities (such as running the 
printer) 
after we had gene to sleep. 
As the need for work space grew, 
the, 
room 
which 
originally 
had 
been designated the 
day 
room 
for 
relaxing or watching television was usurped by computer and photo. 
logging needs so that the kitchen was the only space for informal 
congregation 
and 
socializing. 
Fortunately, 
 
it 
was 
a 
large..? 
kitchen! 
Establishing the housing situation also involved 
contacting 
with 
a cleaning service to come in once a week and service 
both 
the 
headquarters and the apartments. 
We also had to arrange for 
.J 
telephone 
service 
and 
the rental 
of 
a photocopier. 
A very 
productive 
detail 
was renting a post office box in 
the 
nearby 
village of New Lisbon. 
The postmaster, 
Jim Doyle, turned out to 
be 
an 
excellent source of information on the area, 
and a 
goocl 
friend 
 to boot. 
Carl 
may be able to present a more complete account of 
the 
equipment and its transportation to New Jersey but we did acquire? 
quite 
a stockpile of Nagra tape recorders 
(stereo 
and 
mono) , 
cassette 
recorders 
(several 
used in creating a 
"daisy 
chain'' 
dubbing system), 
reel and cassette tapes, 
microphones, 
cables, 
patch 
cords, 
 
headphones, 
cameras, 
film, 
and 
photographic 
supplies. 
Jay arranged for the rental of O Kaypro microcomputers 
and 2 Prowriter printers; associated supplies included cartons of 
tractor-feed paper, 
ribbons, 
 and floppy 
 disks. We eventually had 
to 
purchase 
miscellaneous 
equipment 
and 
applies 
such 
as> 
batteries, camera bags, and boxes for each fieldworker's disks. 
Another 
logistical component was transportation. 
First 
we 
had 
to get the fieldworkers to Washington for the 
pre-fieldwork 
meeting (the two days before going to New Jersey). 
This involved 
some rather complex arrangements with the Library's travel office 
as 
some 
people 
got 
prepaid tickets 
and 
others 
were 
to 
be 
reimbursed. 
Hotel 
arrangements 
and reservations for our 
large 
dinners also 
 warranted some attention. 
In New Jersey itself,  
WE-? 
used five Avis rental cars. 
One I picked up in Philadelphia as I 
began to spend more time in New Jersey in late August. The • 
•thers> 
were 
rented 
in 
and returned to 
Washington. 
For 
each 
rental 
agreement we listed the names and driver's license numbers of all 
project 
members so that any person could 
 drive any • 
•f the 
cars. 
4 
We 
also made duplicates of the keys and kept them in the 
office 
so 
if one fieldworker was out with another, and his/her car 
thus 
unused 
it could be tapped by ethers. 
(This turned out to 
be 
a 
very 
smart arrangement when we had visitors from Washington 
and 
also 
because 
Malls 
car broke dawn early in the survey 
and 
he 
needed 
to use project cars for his fieldwork.) The only 
 
problem 
with 
Avis was their complicated credit and 
billing 
procedures. 
GSA no longer allows 
 cars to be used can projects such as ours and 
the 
contract 
 
carrier 
for 
the Library 
(American 
Rental) 
had 
outrageous mileage charges. 
Although the cars represented one of 
the larger expenditures of the project we did save a significant 
amount by going with a 3-month mini-lease from Avis. 
Another 
issue 
relating to transportation was the 
distance 
some 
fieldworkers 
had 
to 
travel 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
the 
geographical 
areas assigned to them. 
Jens in particular had 
tc, 
travel 
2 hours each way to reach the Delaware Day area where 
he 
worked 
and 
he 
felt 
this took a lot of 
time 
away 
from 
both 
interviewing and office processing of tapes, 
notes, 
etc. Joseph 
too 
experienced 
similar problems but the rest of the crew 
felt 
comfortable 
with the location. 
It certainly did put us 
in 
the 
heart of the pines, 
in the core woods area. The only ether major-, 
alternative 
was a motel in Mays Landing which would have put 
us 
rather 
far south for most of the field team. 
The Lebanon 
State 
Forest 
locale 
was within easy access of the Barnegat 
Bay, 
the 
pygmy forest, 
the Mul l 
ica River, 
the agricultural fringes, 
and 
the 
suburban developments, 
not to mention being only an 
hour's 
s 
drive from Philadelphia when the urbophiles in the crowd needed a 
big-city 
fix. 
I certainly sympathized with Jens's 
plight 
and 
5 
towards 
the end we managed to find some temporary 
accomodations 
for 
him 
in the southern part of the region so that he could 
gCI 
out 
on 2 or 3 day field trips and then be at headquarters for 
a 
few days. 
4. 
Day t2 day life. 
A typical day in the life of the Pinelands 
t=olklife 
Project 
began 
with 
fieldworkers 
assembling 
in 
the 
kitchen 
between 8 and 8:30 a.m. 
to prepare 
breakfast, 
receive 
mail 
(I would usually go to the post office about 8:15.), perhaps 
do some computer work or printing. 
Some days a f 
ieldworker would 
 
spend almost the entire day in the office--dubbing tapes, writing 
fieldnotes, 
logging 
tapes 
and photos, 
racking 
and 
numbering 
slides, 
and making appointments for interviews. Other days might 
be spent entirely in the field, or there were times when half the:? 
day might be spent interviewing and the other half in the office. 
Much 
depended 
on 
the 
fieldworkers' 
own 
systems 
of 
pacing 
themselves and of course the vagaries of informant availability. 
Evening 
hours found an occasional congregation 
 for 
dinner, 
either 
at 
headquarters or one of the local taverns 
or 
diners. 
Documentation 
tasks 
often 
took up entire 
evenings 
with 
only 
occasional forays into the kitchen for a snack, 
a TV show, 
or a 
chat that sometimes evolved into a more complicated discussion of 
how 
one's fieldwork was progressing or questions 
involving 
the 
basic 
issues 
of 
the research. 
These 
kinds 
of 
conversationv 
usually 
took place between ` or 3 of the fieldworkers, 
although 
they may have been reported 
 and discussed further 
 with other team 
members. 
We 
rarely gat together as a group and hashed out 
what 
was 
going on. 
Christine often suggested that we 
organize 
ze 
more 
E 
frequent 
dinners 
together, 
or evening meetings but 
they 
never-, 
quite 
came about, 
partly in the rush to keep up with the 
neavy 
office 
workload and partly, 
I think, 
because some 
people 
had 
profound 
differences 
of opinion with Christine as to 
how 
work 
should 
be undertaken. 
While extended discussion of these issues-> 
might 
have been helpful there was some worry that 
interpersonal 
tensions 
would 
be heightened if disagreements 
were 
aired 
toc, 
freely. 
The 
flip 
side of this situation was that when team 
members 
collaborated on interviews fieldwork became truly a joint effort. 
Both 
people were involved in the event 
as an integral 
part 
of 
their 
research, 
although 
on 
a 
few occasions 
the 
visit 
was 
perceived as one person's "gig" and the other went along just 
to 
help 
with recording or photographing. I believe that at one timer 
or 
another 
almost every full-time fieldworker worked 
with 
the 
others, 
e.g., 
Jens and I taped a church service, 
Christine and 
Elaine went to a garden club meeting, 
Jens and Elaine documented 
a Halloween parade. 
Joseph naturally accompanied fieldworkers on 
some 
visits, 
but 
was much more interested in some topics 
than 
others 
(and 
also got along better with some of the 
people) 
SCI 
that skewed portions of his coverage. 
(He also did a lot of solo 
shooting.) 
When 
Carl 
was 
around 
he 
frequently 
accompanied 
f 
i 
e 
l 
dworkers 
to 
help 
with 
documentation 
duties; 
this 
was 
especially 
helpful in the first week as we were getting used 
tc, 
the equipment. 
A major 
source 
of trouble with the 
daily 
experience 
of 
working in New Jersey 
was a constellation of factors relating t 
ci 
number 
of 
fieldworkers, 
space, 
equipment 
scheduling, 
time 
7 
constraints, 
pacing 
of 
the 
work, 
and 
competition 
between 
fieldworkers 
which 
resulted 
in not 
insignificant 
amounts 
of 
tension. 
 
A primary concern on my part, 
and voiced also 
 by 
Mal, 
Bonnie, and Elaine, was that there were too many people around in 
relation 
to the amount of space we had. 
I want to make it clear 
that 
no 
one 
objected 
to 
the 
employment 
of 
the 
part-time 
fieldworkers 
or 
the 
consultants; 
their contributions 
to 
the 
project were invaluable. But they had a tendency to all arrive at 
the same time, even after some attempts at the midterm meeting to 
readjust their schedules. 
As students with classes in the middle 
of the week it certainly made since for Mal, 
Tom, 
and Bonnie to 
use the Thursday-Sunday period for their work. This timetable put 
great demands • 
•n equipment use (especially cameras) and 
computer 
time. 
Several 
times 
I had 
t• 
• use some 
quiet 
persuasion 
to 
negotiate 
with a full-time fieldworker to relinquish some 
space 
to the part-timers who were grumbling that they had come all 
the 
way out to the headquarters and could not get their work done. On 
the other hand, the full-timers, who had a heavier workload, felt 
the 
need 
to be at the computers a lot so as not to get too 
far, 
behind. 
In addition to equipment use, space was a problem. Trying to 
fit 
8 or 10 people in the work space was 
often 
difficult. 
The 
crowded conditions impinged on Elaine and I too, 
giving us little 
privacy 
and also the feeling of always being "on call" to 
solve 
problems. While the proximity of accomodations to office space is 
essential 
in projects of this kind, 
I would strongly 
 
recommend 
that 
the two areas be somewhat separate so that socializing 
and 
private 
time 
can be distinct for 
all 
workers. 
Also, 
careful. 
8 
thought 
needs 
to 
be 
given 
to 
supplying 
adequate 
space 
requirements 
for the number of people involved. 
Throughout 
the 
project 
I ruminated (as did others) about the payoff between thE-• 
extra 
information 
collected 
by the 
addition 
of 
the 
project 
associates and the stress caused by the demands placed 
 on the use? 
of 
space and equipment and on personal interactions. 
It was not 
only 
the full-timers who suffered, 
but the 
entire 
team. 
Wheal 
combined 
with 
some of the ether pressures described 
below 
the 
situation 
could 
have become more explosive if the 
project 
had 
lasted much longer. 
Again, 
it should be stressed that these tensions had little 
to 
do with the actual people involved. 
It was more a problem of 
numbers than of personalities. 
There was tendency, 
however, 
on 
the part of the full-timers (Jens, 
Elaine, 
Christine, 
Sue) 
to 
feel a little put upon. After the first week., 
when the Washington 
contingent 
disappeared 
and 
before 
the 
Penn 
people 
and 
photographer started working regularly, 
there was a period of 
a 
few 
weeks 
when 
it was just the four of us. 
That 
was 
a very 
managable 
number and despite some philosophical conflicts we got 
along together very well. 
In fact, we called ourselves "the corEa 
four." As previous coordinators have noted in their reports, 
the 
first 
weeks 
of a project are very important in 
establishing 
a 
team 
feeling. 
While 
by the end of the project I think 
we 
had 
achieved 
that in reference to all project workers, 
the 
initial. 
bonding that occurred with the full-timers continued. 
inued. 
Despite 
the 
feelings 
of 
solidarity, 
there 
was 
SOME.? 
competition as well. 
Having been alerted to a similar 
situation 
that 
occurred 
in 
the Blue Midge Project, 
I was 
not 
totally 
9 
surprized. 
I know 
that I kept an eye on how many tapes 
I was: 
producing 
 
compared to the others. 
Several times Jens and Elaine 
and Christine voiced worries about keeping up with their share of 
the work, 
especially by referring to one of the ethers whom they 
perceived as the pace-setter, 
an identification that the 
person 
selected seemed astonished to receive as s/he had someone else in 
mind 
as 
the one "who was doing the most." The 
periodic 
visitc> 
from 
Mary 
also had the effect of accelerating the 
workload 
as 
everyone 
really wanted to reassure her that the work was 
get inq 
done and she always had new suggestions and contacts. 
While 
we knew such pressure might be counter-productive 
it 
was hard to pull out of the circle of always wanting to do more--
for 
ourselves, 
for other fieldworkers, 
for the Center. 
As the 
tapes 
and photos and pages of notes piled higher and 
higher 
we 
rarely 
took time to congratulate ourselves or admire what we had 
done, 
but 
rather 
plunged into a new flurry 
of 
activity. 
The 
result was considerable depression about the Eth and 7th week 
of 
the 
project. 
Even 
the 
trip to AFS did little to 
relieve 
the 
tension., 
It simply made us feel more aware of what we had to do. 
That 
next week I noticed a significant drop in enthusiasm 
which 
may have been related somewhat to post-AFS blues but also because 
we 
were just so tired.  
The one positive benefit of 
Christine's 
death was to keep us quiet and inactive for a few days. Jens felt 
compelled to use the time to get caught up on logging but 
Elaine 
and 
I did 
little except sit and talk. 
I think 
that 
enforced 
period of rest, despite the emotional upheavel that went with it, 
was enough to reenergize us for the last 10 days. 
Again, 
solutions 
are always easier- to devise in 
retrospect 
10 
and rust be weighed against the final results, but I think more R 
K R time needs t• 
• be built into projects of this sort. 
It should 
be 
recognized 
that 
the 
people 
involved 
are 
going 
to 
be 
tremendously 
productive, 
 
will 
work 
long 
hours 
and 
produce 
excellent results. 
The quality can perhaps even be increased 
by 
encouraging 
more 
relaxation time, 
be it trips to 
movies, 
the 
share, 
short 
visits 
home or to nearby 
attractions 
(like 
New 
York). I remember one night when a thunderstorm demanded that all 
the computers be turned off to prevent electrical damage. We were 
forced 
to sit around a talk and eat and relax and we laughed 
at 
how 
strange 
it felt. 
More experiences of that sort need to 
be 
encouraged. 
5. 
Fieldwork. 
In the initial phase of the project the pinelands 
National 
Reserve was divided into four sections. 
Three of these 
were 
assigned 
to the full-time fieldworkers and 
Mary 
and 
Suer 
shared a region. 
Relying on contacts 
acts provided by Mary, Nora, and 
"people 
in the know" such as John Sinton and Mary-Ann 
Thompson, 
the 
researchers fanned out into the field for a period that 
was 
supposed 
to 
be 
3 or 4 weeks long but ended up 
being 
about 
`; 
weeks. 
They 
also met with township officials such as 
planners, 
recreat ion
 
 
directors, 
and 
mayors 
and 
also 
 
encountered 
new 
informants 
by attending public events (church 
bazaars, 
seafood 
festivals), 
eating at restaurants, or just stepping when a house 
or sign caught their eye. 
Following 
the 
geographic concentration, 
people 
were 
to 
shift to topical specialities, 
e.g., Jens and maritime foiklife, 
Elaine 
and 
yards 
and gender-based 
divisions 
of 
labor. 
This 
11 
refocusing 
was supposed to occur in concer t with the ar'r'ival 
of 
the 
project 
associates 
who had been hired with an 
eye 
toward 
their 
particular interests. 
It ended up being very hard to 
get 
out 
of the geographical areas. 
People were familiar 
with 
them 
topographically, 
they 
had 
made contacts and were 
reaping 
the 
benefits 
of 
ongoing 
relationships with 
informants 
and 
their, 
families. 
I never 
felt as though we shifted from 
the 
initial 
identifications with people, 
places, 
and interests that evolved 
during 
the 
first 
few 
weeks 
of 
the 
project. 
This 
was 
not 
necessarily a bad situation. 
I think we all recognized what 
waVr> 
going 
on 
and with the renewed concern for 
addressing 
land-use 
management issues as stated at the midterm meeting, we skillfully 
combined 
the 
various 
requirements 
of 
geographic 
coverage, 
folk.life survey, 
and personal interests to an extent that almost 
everyone 
got 
part 
of the information that they 
needed 
and/or 
wanted. 
Despite 
extremely 
well-written 
statements 
of 
purpose 
available 
to 
the 
fieldworkers well in advance of 
the 
project 
(i.e.,  
Mary's 
"One 
Space, 
Many 
Places"), 
the 
actual 
implementation 
•n of the focus of the research was sometimes hard tct 
conceptualize. 
While working alone for the first few weeks, 
the 
full-time 
fieldworkers 
concentrated mostly on just 
getting 
tc, 
know 
their area and putting things and thoughts on 
film, 
tape, 
and paper. When the project associates and consultants arrived in 
early 
October, 
along with the return of Mary and 
Carl, 
things 
became more complex. Some people, I think, never really were sure 
what they were supposed to do. 
Again, the midterm meeting helped 
somewhat 
in 
re-orientating ourselves t• 
• the main goals 
of 
the 
12 
project 
and 
and 
if 
we had 
hashed 
things 
out 
more 
amongst 
ourselves the situation may not have remained so confused. 
Turning 
to more concrete factors, 
the pr ocessing component 
of 
the 
fieldwork (fieldnotes, 
tape 
and 
photo 
legs, 
racking 
slides, 
dubbing 
tapes) 
was considered a heavy but 
unavoidablE::) 
burden. 
The 
fieldworkers themselves figured out that for 
every 
hour spent in the field, 3 hours of office time was required. The? 
distribution 
of priorities was interesting. 
Some 
people 
spent 
considerable 
energy in writing detailed fieldnotes; 
ethers made 
incredibly 
precise tape transcriptions; 
others 
showed 
special 
care in the editing and description of photos. 
Certainly, no om•-• 
ignored 
one task for the ethers but we all found ourselves doing 
slightly better ,lobs when tackling the chores that most 
appealecl 
to us. 
Some 
of the load was relieved by hiring an office assistant 
for a few weeks to handle the tape dubbing (particularly for 
thF-• 
project 
associates 
who 
had so little time in the 
office) 
and 
filing hard copies of logs. 
This person was a local high 
school. 
student, 
Twana Watson. 
I had contacted clerical skills/business 
instructor at the regional high school and she sent about 5 girl's 
out 
for 
interviews. 
As 
I recall, 
we 
paid 
minimum 
wage 
($3. 30/hour) 
but could have afforded a little 
 
more. 
There 
was:> 
some 
"dead time" as the tapes were being dubbed which I tried to 
take advantage of by assigning miscellaneous duties 
to Twana but 
the 
demands 
were not very great and she quit after 
about 
four, 
weeks. Since I thought I could handle a lot of the dubbing 'Myself 
while 
I was around the office (and it was getting 
towwards 
the 
end of the project) I decided not to hire another person but I dc, 
13 
think it was helpful to have had some assistance of this sort. 
The 
general 
consensus was that the computers were a 
great 
help. 
People 
found them tremendously helpful in doing fast 
and 
accurate 
tape 
transcriptions. 
The 
ability 
to 
edit 
quickly 
produced 
more refined fie 1 
dnot es. 
The computers increased 
bo0i 
the 
quality 
and the quantity of the output 
but 
sometimes 
put 
additional 
stress 
on the worker. 
Knowing how the computer 
wasi> 
supposed 
to 
make things "easier" subtly acted to 
increase 
the 
time and effort put forth. 
In terms of "workplace life" 
 the printers were bothersome 
 as 
they were quite noisy. Some fieldworkers had a tendency to really 
pound 
away on the computer keys, 
forgetting that they needed 
a 
lighter 
touch 
than 
a typewriter. 
We originally kept 
all 
the 
computers 
in 
one 
room 
which made 
for 
very 
close 
 
quarters, 
especially 
when 
transcribing_ equipment and 
light 
boards 
were 
brought in. 
So we moved one computer into another room to be used 
mainly 
in 
logging 
photos. 
Another 
was 
moved 
upstairs 
into::, 
Elaine's 
room, 
not for her exclusive use but more to provide 
a 
really 
quiet place for thinking and writing. 
Fieldworkers 
were 
told 
that 
they could take the computers to their apartments 
if 
they wanted to work over there. 
(One of the reasons why 
Kayprot> 
were 
chosen 
was because of their portability and durability 
in 
transit.) 
Few 
of the people took advantage of such 
an 
option, 
preferring to be in the center of things at the office with 
easy 
access to the kitchen, 
printers, 
telephones, dubbing equipment, 
supplies, 
and 
also, 
I suspect, 
because 
of the 
feelings 
of 
isolation about beein❑ in this rural area at night that would 
be 
mitigated be being around the other fieldworkers. 
14 
Related 
to these close quarters workplace experiences was a 
positive 
sense 
of 
bonding 
that 
occurred 
as 
the 
project 
progressed. 
I have already mentioned the strong ties between the 
four 
 full-timers, 
but similar if less intense feelings of "being 
in this together" ultimately emerged for the whole group. Perhaps 
the 
most visible expression was the design of a project 
T-shirt 
ordered 
from 
a 
local sporting goods stores. 
The 
logo 
was 
a 
computer keyboard and screen with a pine tree drawn on the screen, 
with little eyes peering out 
(a reference to local assessments of 
the 
isolation 
of the Fines as inaccurate, 
because people 
were 
always watching each others comings and goings). The flip side of 
such togetherness and camaraderie were the inevitable personality 
conflicts and the aforementioned pressures of too many people 
in 
one 
place 
at one time trying to do too much. 
While we 
worried 
aloud about some of these things I do not think anything 
reached 
crises 
proportions (although if Christine's death had not slowed 
us 
dawn 
they might have). 
Despite all the problems we 
were 
a 
mighty articulate bunch and our ability to talk one on one or 
in 
small groups relieved a lot of the pressure. 
E. 
Community 
relations. 
Because of the sensitive nature of the? 
Pinelands Commission's activities and the whole national 
reserve 
concept, 
we 
were very careful about how we presented 
ourselves:, 
and 
our 
work. 
Although we were not actually "working for" 
the 
Commission or, the National Park Service, we certainly had ties tc:l 
them 
that we were circumspect in acknowledging. 
This 
fuzziness 
produced 
some discussion about how open to be 
in 
acknowledging 
these 
relationships. 
I remember Elaine and I hurriedly hiding a 
15 
copy 
of the Pinelands Comprehensive Management Elan just 
before 
an informant gat in our car, 
a person who a few minutes 
earlier" 
had 
made 
it 
clear 
that 
he was not 
especially 
fond 
of 
the 
Commission. As we got to know some informants better and as pressi 
articles 
carne 
out 
the 
relationship became 
clearer 
and 
more 
acceptable. 
Still, 
I was always more comfortable with saying 
1: 
was 
studying 
life 
in south Jersey than 
in 
the 
Pinelands, 
a 
description 
that Carl said he felt 
strange about using, 
but he.? 
later 
admitted 
that he was not the person "who had to 
talk 
to 
these people (meaning informants) every day." 
It 
was 
always very interesting to 
identify 
ourselves 
as 
working 
for the federal government. 
Most people were 
intrigued 
and/or 
flattered 
by 
such interest. 
I often wondered 
if 
they 
actually knew what the Library of Congress was; 
we sometimes had 
to describe it as "the national library." We tried to be as clear 
as 
possible about what would happen to the pictures we 
took 
or, 
the tapes we made, 
what passible products would result, how this 
material was accessible to the public (including the 
informants,. 
their families, 
future generations), and how people were free to 
go off the record at any moment. 
Such sensitivity enabled us to accomplish a great 
deal. 
In 
only 
a few instances did people really hold back (such as 
Denny 
Doyle 
did with Christine and even she eventually won him 
over). 
Of 
course, 
the 
most 
signficant 
problem 
was 
with 
Elizabeth 
Woodford. 
Mary's 
and 
my Sunday night meeting with 4 of 
these 
women 
was 
quite 
a 
"roast," 
" something that I do 
not 
care 
tc, 
relive, 
but 
it 
did 
help to smooth over 
a potentially 
rocky 
situation 
and 
was mitigated even further by Gene's 
visit 
with 
16 
Woodford a few weeks later,. 
Press 
relations 
were generally good. 
The first 
newspaper 
article, 
in the Atlantic City Press, 
resulted from an interview 
Mary 
gave 
in Washington so we were not aware 
of 
it, 
but 
our' 
informants certainly were. Following that we had visits from marry 
local 
papers, 
the Asbury Park Press, 
Burl inuton County 
Times, 
Camden Courier-Post., as well as from the National Geographic News 
Service 
and 
the New York Times. 
Christine's tragedy 
also 
was 
cause 
for 
note in local papers and the 
Philadelphia 
Inguirer. 
Some 
of the articles were quite superficial; 
others showed 
thc-;• 
reporter's 
intense 
desire to really understand what we were 
up 
to 
A few times the burden of talking to reporters became 
quite 
heavy. 
It 
is understandable that the more publicity we could get 
for 
the 
proj ect, 
the 
Center, 
and for 
folklore 
research 
ire 
general, the better, but the interviews did eat into our time and 
the 
persistence 
of 
some of the reporters was 
wearing 
on 
the:... 
psyche. 
We 
ordered 
courtesy 
prints 
of 
photographs 
taken 
on 
interviews 
to send to our informants. 
At the end of the project 
we also 
 sent certificates of appreciation to almost 
 everyone 
who 
was connected with the project in some way--Library staff, 
state 
forest and state school people, Pine 1 
ands Commission and National 
Park Service staff, 
informants, 
 
consultants, 
and the like.  
WEB 
also 
are 
producing a cranberry cookbook that could be 
used 
as 
something 
to promote the area fairly quickly, 
as opposed to the:? 
long-term 
product 
development 
of 
the 
guidebook, 
atlas, 
ethn• 
•biol ogy report, 
etc. 
We had to answer many quest ions 
frorii 
informants 
about 
"what's 
going to happen to all 
this 
stuff." 
17 
Potential 
products--such 
as photo essays or 
exhibits--may 
and 
should 
be mentioned to stress that we are not just invading 
and 
retreating with our material, 
that the public will get something 
out 
of 
it, 
but 
it should be 
stressed 
that 
developing 
such 
products takes a considerable amount of time. 
7. 
Meetings. 
There were three important meetings connected with 
the 
project. 
The 
first was the pre-fieldwork meeting 
held 
in 
Washington 
for two days prior to setting up shop in New 
Jersey. 
The fieldworkers (except for Gene) met each other, began computer 
training, and engaged in a day-long discussion of project design, 
goals, 
documentation, 
etc. 
They 
met Center staff and some New 
Jersey 
people who were attending--Rita 
Moonsammy, 
Pat 
Sheehari 
(National 
Park. Service) , Libby Marsh (Stockton State College)--
and 
 
 
also 
were 
oriented toward more 
mundane 
matters 
such 
as 
lodging_ and payroll. 
After 
5 weeks in the field there was an evaluation 
meeting 
in 
New 
Jersey attended by the entire team (except Gene 
again), 
Carl, 
Mary, 
Alan,  and some advisors--Rita, Henry G 
1 
ass i 
e, 
Barry 
Brady 
of 
the 
Pinelands Commission, 
John Sinton 
(a 
Pinelands:> 
Commissioner). 
The 
meeting was tape recorded so details can 
be 
found 
therein but its main purpose was to assess what 
had 
beers 
done and where we were going. 
The final, 
past-fieldwork meeting was held in Washington in 
January, 
about two months after leaving New Jersey. Fieldworkervi 
were 
asked to have their final reports done well in 
advance 
so 
that 
they 
could 
be circulated to 
the 
nether 
people. 
Outside 
attendees 
included 
Pita, 
park service 
people, 
and 
Pinelands 
18 
Commission 
representatives. 
Much of the discussion centered 
on 
what 
the 
project 
could 
tell the 
Commission 
about 
land 
USsC 
management 
or the park service about interpretative programming. 
On the second day, 
it was just the project team 
again, 
talking 
abut 
product development and future research and presentations. 
This 
was also 
time for fieldworkers to finish keyboarding 
some 
of their materials, 
select duplicate slides, 
make hard 
copies, 
and general clean-up chores. 
S. 
Finances. 
The 
budget 
for the project had been 
tentatively 
outlined 
before 
I started working. 
I updated it 
in 
September 
before 
leaving for the field and in November upon my 
return 
tc, 
Washington. 
In both instances I did not make substantial changes 
in 
the categories listed but concentrated on simply updating they 
figures. 
After talking to the person from Internal Audit who was 
making 
a study of the project, 
Carl and I undertook in March 
a 
major 
reorganization of the "Summary of Expenditures," adding 
a 
preface 
explaining some of the design and personnel 
changes 
irl 
the 
project. 
This 
seemed 
to mollify the auditor but 
she 
did 
stress 
the need for regular budget updates and the putting 
dowrl 
on 
paper significant changes in the project that impact 
on 
the 
mo ney spent. 
Another 
financial 
area that needs to be addressed 
is 
the 
issuing of paychecks. Although fieldworkers were told upon hiring 
that 
it takes at least E weeks to generate an initial 
paycheck, 
many 
of 
them were unprepared to go without money for 
so 
long. 
Advances 
were made out of the administrator's budget, 
the funds 
for 
which also took a while to receive and should be one of 
the 
19 
first 
things 
a coordinator 
requests 
so 
that 
the 
money 
is 
available 
by 
the time fieldwork starts. 
Anyway, 
some 
of 
the 
fieldworkers 
took a considerable amount of time to pay back 
thE.? 
advances and this caused some irritation so I would suggest 
that 
the practice not be continued. 
It would be unwise to refrain frorn 
hiring 
someone 
because of their precario=us financial 
situation 
( 
not 
uncommon in today's depressed folklore marketplace) 
but 
1: 
think 
every 
effort 
should 
be 
made 
to 
avoid 
embroiling 
administrative 
finances in the situation. 
Win. 
On the other hand, 
1: 
applaud Brett's efforts in laying out the pay schedule and coping 
with the various kinds of invoices she received. 
I would suggest: 
that 
all members of the field team submit their invoices on 
the 
same days. I had rather a hard time keeping up with the different 
timetables for invoices for full-timers, 
project associates, and 
photographer. 
9. 
Post-fieldwork 
phase. 
As Carl has repeatedly told 
me, 
the 
amount 
of 
time 
for 
past-fieldwork 
activities 
is 
always 
underestimated. With the addition of computer-related issues, 
the.:? 
Pindlands 
project 
is 
no 
exception. 
The 
major 
tasks 
after 
returning from the field included: 
1) a quick inventory of logs, 
tapes, photos, and their temporary 
storage 
2) 
processing 
final 
notes, 
logs, 
and 
photos 
finished 
by 
fieldworkers 
after 
leaving the field (Have 
the 
last 
fevi 
batches of color film shot in the field sent directly to the 
fieldworkers' homes.) 
20 
3) 
keystroking documents compiled 
 without access to the computerFs>

fieldworkers

weeks

ended. 
It 
might 
be 
wise 
to 
plan 
for 
some 
additional 
rental time to complete 
these 
chores, 
or, 
if 
keystroking 
is to be done at the Center, 
hire 
a clerical. 
person to do it.) 
4) 
preparing public presentations for the 
Pinelands 
Commission 
and briefings for the congressional delegations (This 
chore.? 
is 
very 
time-consuming 
and disruptive to 
conducting 
the 
inventory. 
Flan on keeping a set of logs that can be pulled 
apart 
while researching such presentations and another that 
remains inviolable. 
Also do a quick scan of all photos 
and 
make 
duplicates 
of the best ones for immediate 
use, 
then 
restore the integrity of the photo collection. 
Try to avoid 
making 
commitments 
for 
unnecessary 
research 
until 
the 
archiving 
has 
been 
completed, 
for the time

and 
disruption 
•n of the data base can be frustrating.) 
5) 
pest-fieldwork meeting (hotel, 
travel, 
conference roa=m, 
and 
restaurant 
arrangements; invoices) 
6) 
final 
inventory 
(checking 
for missing 
tapes 
and 
slides; 
printing one set of hard copies; 
listing administrative and 
fieldwork 
files; 
writing 
final 
inventory 
and 
report; 
assigning 
Archive 
of Folk Culture and the 
Recorded 
Sound 
numbers 
to tapes and doing the concordance with the project 
numbers). 
21 
The 
major past-fieldwork chore has been the editing of 
all 
the 
documents on the computer disks for standarization 
of 
item 
numbers, 
dates, 
geographic codes, keywords, sensitive material, 
grammar, 
and 
the 
like. 
As we progress and see how 
long 
each 
log/file 
takes 
to 
edit, 
we have had to discard 
some 
of 
the 
corrections in the interest of time. 
Of curse, 
future prodectv-, 
will 
be 
able 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
mistakes 
we 
have 
made. 
Hopefully, Elaine, Carl and I will write a separate assessment of-
the 
 computer-related aspects of the project.

General comments 
 abgMt coordinator's role. 
In preparing 
t 
r.:, 
write 
this report 
 I read some of the commentaries 
 written by the 
coordinators 
of 
other 
Center projects. 
Such items 
 
were 
very 
interesting in terms of bath format 
 (e. g. , Greta Swenson' s weekly 
reports 
from 
Chicago) and content 
(Tom 
Burns's 
philosophical 
expositions 
 on the Rhode Island project). 
. I wish I had read them 
at 
the 
beginning of the project, 
as I did with the Blue 
Ridge 
report. Compared to some of the troubles these people had, 
I felt 
that my overall experiences 
 as coordinator were goad ones. I felt 
trusted and backed by the people at the Center. 
Mary and I had z: 
good 
rapport 
and respected each other's 
"spheres 
of 
action.'' 
Occasionally 
I felt 
some 
conflict between my 
dual 
 
roles 
as:a 
administrator and fieldworker; 
when I was engaged in one type of 
work I often worried about what I might be ignoring in the other. 
However, 
this conflict is inherent in the job and I rarely 
felt 
any 
pressure from anyone besides myself to pay attention to 
one?. 
area 
when 
it was really time to concentrate on the 
.other. 
The 
position 
ion 
provided 
2n 
excellent 
opportunity 
to 
refine 
my 
22 
administrative 
and 
fieldwork 
abilities. 
As 
with 
many 
young 
folklore 
professionals, 
I had 
never 
been 
involved 
in 
team 
research. 
The 
rationale for team fieldwork and the mechanics of 
its 
implementation 
continues 
to intrigue me and 
I intend 
to 
pursue 
this aspect of my experience as coordinator from 
a 
analytical perspective.

PINELANDS FOLKLIFE PROJECT 
SUMMARY OF ARCHIVING PHASE 
Elaine Thatcher and Sue Samuelson 
May 18, 1984 
The 
archiving 
phase of the Pinelands Folklife Project 
has 
been one of making decisions, 
changing our minds, 
and 
learning 
much. 
This 
report is a summary of what we have accomplished and 
recommendations 
for 
future 
"archives in the 
field" 
projects. 
Also attached are documents relating to the inventory and editing 
of materials. 
As 
of the date of this report, 
all primary materials 
from 
the field documentation phase of the Pinelands Project have 
been 
inventoried 
and 
the 
corresponding 
logs and 
notes 
have 
been 
prepared for transfer to the BRS automated search system. 
All of 
the documents were inventoried in January, 
1984, 
and during the 
ensuing 
months, 
we 
tried to take care of tapes that 
were 
not 
dubbed, 
files that were missing, 
and other problems. 
In May we 
counted 
everything 
again 
and filled 
in 
the 
remaining 
gaps. 
This 
report 
is 
organized in such a way as 
to 
allow 
the 
sections describing the inventory and search helps to be 
printed 
separately 
and made available to researchers who have 
questions 
about the collection. 
Editing 
In 
editing the field-generated documents for archival 
use, 
we 
paid 
attention 
to 
four 
areas 
(See 
"Editing 
Guidelines" 
appended to this report for details): 
1. 
Basic copy editing -- correcting typos and obvious 
punctuation 
or 
other 
writing 
errors. 
We 
did 
not 
attempt 
to 
deal with more complex 
editing questions. 
2. 
Computer 
readability 
-- making 
field 
markers, 
dates, 
item 
numbers, 
and geographic codes consistent 
and 
accurate 
so 
that 
the 
retrieval 
system 
will 
locate correct information. 
3. 
Keywords, codes, and document divisions -- dividing 
documents 
into logically and geographically determined 
sections, 
and 
adding generic keywords and 
geographic 
codes. 
These 
operations 
will 
make 
it 
easier 
to 
retrieve 
data dealing with specific phenomena tied 
to 
specific locations. 
4. 
Sensitive 
material -- readi g for statements that 
may be libellous or incriminating to informants. 
Each 
case 
was 
considered 
individually 
and 
reviewed 
by 
several 
people before decisions were made to delete or 
reword statements. 
Hard copies of the original 
files 
will 
be kept, 
but will be unavailable for public use. 
In one case, 
we had an informant, Betty Wendt, request 
1 
that 
her name be deleted from all of the documents 
in 
which she was mentioned. 
She is known in the files as 
Mrs. 
X, 
and references to her occur in notes and logs 
by Elaine Thatcher, Christine Cartwright, Mary Hufford, 
and Sue Samuelson. 
While 
all 
four of these areas were important, 
the 
second 
group 
of 
procedures 
relating 
to 
computer 
readability 
was 
considered 
the 
most 
critical because 
it 
would 
have 
lasting 
effects 
on 
the 
usefulness of the archive. 
Early 
on 
in 
the 
editing 
process, 
we 
tried 
to include a large amount 
of 
copy 
editing, 
reading 
carefully 
for 
spelling, 
punctuation, 
and 
grammar, 
but 
we realized that the process was going 
incredibly 
slowly. 
We therefore relegated such concerns to a lower priority 
and 
gave 
most 
of our attention to matters of 
consistency 
and 
accuracy for the computer. 
The addition of generic keywords went 
through 
a similar metamorphosis. 
We began with a fairly 
long 
list 
of keywords and added to it as we came across new subjects. 
The process of adding keywords began to get out of hand, 
though, 
and for a time we abandoned the task, 
fearing that we would 
not 
complete the editing in the time we had available. 
However, 
as 
we 
became faster and more efficient in editing for the computer, 
we began adding a few basic keywords again. 
Some (but not 
all) 
of 
the 
documents 
that 
do 
not have 
keywords 
added 
are 
the 
following: 
Joseph 
Czarnecki's black and white photo logs beginning 
at 
about BJC217770-13. 
Joseph Czarnecki's color photo logs beginning with CJC001. 
All of Nora Rubinstein's fieldnotes. 
Because of the comprehensive nature of the BRS index, 
we do 
not 
think 
that 
this 
lack 
of keywords will be too 
damaging 
in 
a 
search. 
The 
searcher 
may have to enter more 
specific 
search 
terms instead of generic ones. 
For instance, instead of entering 
"plants," the researcher may have to enter "Pine Barrens gentian" 
or "pine," or even just "tree" or "flower." 
Most 
of the added words relate to the main concerns of 
the 
research: 
plants and animals. 
Other common ones were foodways 
and festive occasions. 
The list of keywords is appended to this 
report. 
Continued learning about the capabilities and limitations of 
the 
Onyx computer and BRS system led to our changing 
horses 
in 
the 
middle of the stream on a number of occasions. 
One is 
the 
keyword 
procedure described above. 
Another has to do with 
the 
way 
some 
fieldworkers broke up their fieldnotes into "A," 
"B," 
"C," etc., 
components. 
For instance, a worker may have written 
FET1024, 
then written more under FET1024B, 
adding an "A" to the 
original entry. 
The editors combined some, but not all of these 
into single editions of fieldnotes for the day in 
question. 
We 
at 
first 
thought it necessary to combine fragments, 
and 
later 
learned 
that 
such 
divisions would 
probably 
be 
read 
without 
difficulty by the computer. 
There 
are other aspects of computer readability to which we 
2 
still do not know the answers. 
Will the presence or absence of a 
double space (blank line) before the text markers (TXO1:, 
TX02:) 
make a difference in whether the document will be read 
correctly 
for retrieval purposes? 
We don't know, and some of the documents 
have a blank line before the text markers and some do 
not. 
Our 
feeling is that it will not matter, 
but it was a subject of some 
concern 
at 
one point. 
This question may also apply 
to 
other 
field markers such as "INUM:," "FWOR:," and "DATE:." 
As 
soon as the documents on floppy disk are transferred 
to 
the Onyx, we expect that there will be a mass printout of all the 
materials. 
This 
will 
most 
likely 
be 
supervised 
by 
Carl 
Fleischhauer, 
with 
whom we have had discussions on the subject. 
There should be two printouts, one for t-he archive in New Jersey, 
and one here at the Library. 
The hard copies we have now do not 
reflect 
the 
changes 
made during editing, 
as 
they 
(the 
hard 
copies) 
were printed in the field. 
These field-printed 
copies 
should 
not be available to the public, 
since they 
contain 
the 
sensitive material that has been deleted on the disks. 
However, 
the 
material may be useful at some future date, 
so we recommend 
that 
it be kept in a file to be opened to the public 
in 
75-100 
years. 
Some 
of 
the word processing symbols used in 
the 
WordStar 
program 
will 
not print correctly from Unix. 
ASO will have 
to 
make 
the 
necessary 
adjustments in the 
Onyx 
computer 
so 
the 
printout will be correct. 
The list below gives the symbols that 
have come to our attention: 
N 
Wordwrap symbol. 
Occurs at the end of lines in 
WordStar 
Q'—  
Page break symbol 
R 
Occurs before and after words to be printed in 
boldface 
Z.. 
Occurs before and after words to be underscored 
Occurs before characters to appear as subscript 
or 
Occurs before characters to appear as superscript 
The strikeover command results in the deletion of one of the 
characters involved. 
For instance, Martinez, which is 
written with an accent over the "i," makes use of the 
strikeover command. 
The word is typed Marti"PH'nez. 
When 
printed 
from 
the 
Onyx, 
however, 
the 
"i" 
is 
omitted, resulting in the printout "Mart'nez." 
3 
How to avoid major editing on future projects 
Due 
to problems with the Onyx computer, 
we have 
not 
been 
able 
to 
transfer 
the edited field documents 
onto 
the 
search 
system, 
and so the efficacy of our work has not yet been proven. 
There are still unanswered questions about whether we did all the 
right things in preparing our materials 4or the computer. 
There 
are some things we have learned, though, that can be passed on to 
the 
planners of the next project, 
assuming that 
the 
documents 
will go into a search system identical or similar to BRS. 
The 
greatest amount of misunderstanding of instructions 
by 
fieldworkers 
seemed 
to 
center 
around 
geographic 
codes 
and 
keywords. 
Part 
of the reason for this misunderstanding relates 
to the fact that the planners of the Pinelands Project could 
not 
know 
in 
advance exactly what the demands of the 
search 
system 
would 
be. 
Now 
we 
can see that it might be easier 
if 
future 
document 
templates include a slot for a geographic code 
at 
the 
beginning of each text. 
We know now that it is not necessary to 
attach 
a geographic 
code 
to 
each 
and 
every 
mention 
of 
a 
phenomenon. 
It 
is only necessary that the code and the item or 
practice in question occur within the same paragraph or text. 
In 
the 
future, 
fieldworkers 
should 
be 
encouraged 
to 
subdivide their notes according to geographic location or subject 
being discussed. 
This could be done through the use of separate 
text 
markers, 
such as we devised in our editing, 
or separately 
numbered documents, 
such as FET1024A, 
FET1024B, FET1024C. 
Such 
divisions 
should be easy to make for fieldnotes and photo 
logs. 
Tape 
logs might present more of a problem, 
simply 
because 
one 
tends 
to 
get 
involved in the flow of the conversation 
as 
one 
logs, 
and 
it 
would be very difficult to stop and 
think 
about 
geographic codes and text divisions. 
But tapes are less 
likely 
to 
cover a number of places and subjects than a day's fieldnotes 
or several days' photographing. 
It may be that tape logs 
could 
be left whole, with the burden of separating the material left on 
the researcher. 
would recommend that a list of generic keywords be 
drawn 
up in advance of the next field expedition, 
so that fieldworkers 
can 
quickly 
go back over their day's entries and type in a few 
words. 
We discovered that in the absence of a standard list, but 
with a mandate to insert keywords, 
people entered whatever 
term 
happened 
to be on their m nds at the time. 
For 
instance, 
one 
fieldworker 
used "remedies" and "folk medicine" interchangeably, 
along with "veterinary medicine" in some situations. 
One 
could 
conceivably 
also 
use 
"herbal 
medicine," 
"healing," 
"health 
practices," 
and 
a number of other terms for a group of 
related 
phenomena. 
A few carefully chosen keywords and discussion about 
adding new ones could head off a lot of confusion. 
When 
writing 
notes, 
it would be helpful 
if 
fieldworkers 
avoided 
hyphens 
unless 
they 
are 
absolutely 
necessary. 
In 
addition, 
dashes 
should 
be represented by two hyphens 
with 
a 
space on each side: 
-- 
The spaces separate the surrounding 
words 
from 
the hyphens so that the computer does not 
read 
the 
whole string of characters as a single word. 
A space should also 
be 
inserted 
after a slash: 
"and/ or," rather 
than 
"and/or." 
Again, the space makes the computer see two words instead of one.

Inventory 
This 
section of the report accounts for inconsistencies 
in 
the 
sequence of documentary materials. 
A general statement 
of 
the 
documentary 
holdings is attached at the end. 
The 
purpose 
here 
is 
to 
explain 
in detail some 
of 
the 
glitches 
in 
the 
collection. 
Tapes. 
Two 
tape numbers do not exist: 
PFP83-RNR005 
and 
PFP83-RMH051. 
One was found to be useless because of noise, and 
the other had nothing on it. 
PFP83-RCC018 
is 
difficult to work with because an 
attempt 
was 
made 
to 
record on both sides of 
the 
tape. 
It 
must 
be 
listened 
to from both ends, 
and the material on the first 
side 
was 
erased when the second side was recorded. 
This is noted on 
the log. 
At least one corrected cassette copy has been made 
so 
that both parts can be listened to without turning the tape over. 
The two sides are from the same interview. 
Certain 
cassette tapes do not have "originals." 
These 
are 
usually 
tapes 
copied from borrowed originals. 
Such tapes 
are 
labelled 
"Copy 
(no original)." 
The affected tapes 
are 
PFP83-
AMH005, PFP83-AMH017, PFP83-AMH018, and PFP83-AMH019. 
Nora 
Rubinstein 
numbered 
each 
side 
of 
some 
of 
her 
audiocassette 
recordings instead of assigning a single number to 
each cassette. 
The affected items are PFP83-ANR003-004, 006-007, 
008-009, 010-011, 012-013, 014-015. 
Tape logs. 
Some tape logs are missing. 
Gene Hunn and Nora 
Rubinstein 
have 
not 
completed some logs for 
various 
reasons. 
Some of Mal O'Connor's logs are missing, 
and we don't know 
why. 
All 
three people had been notified as of mid-May and were 
asked 
to 
send copies of their hard copies of the missing logs. 
These 
will have to be keystroked onto disks. 
The logs are AEH001, 002, 
003, 004, 008; AMO001; RMO013; ANR016; RNR009, 010. 
Color 
and 
black and white photographs. 
Some 
fieldworkers 
misunderstood 
directions given at the beginning of 
the 
project 
and 
put 
more than 20 slides into a single numbered 
CLOG. 
For 
instance, 
CTC002 
has 27 slides and CNR002 has 
22 
slides. 
In 
addition, 
Joseph Czarnecki's slides were re-edited in May, 1984, 
and many were added to the numbered envelopes that he set up. 
In 
those 
envelopes, 
there 
are usually two racks, 
the 
additional 
slides 
being 
in the second rack. 
The 
additional 
slides 
are 
sometimes brackets or camera dupes of pictures in the first rack; 
these 
carry 
the same number as the similar slide in 
the 
first 
rack, 
but with a slash and a "2," "3," "4," etc., indicating the 
second-rack position. A sample number might be PFP83-CJC008-15/2. 
Others do not have counterparts in the first rack, 
and are given 
letters 
instead of numbers, 
accompanied by a slash and 
another 
number 
(there 
are no "l"s following the slashes 
-- the 
second 
rack 
sequences 
always beginswith "2"). 
An example of 
one 
of 
these numbers would be PFP83-CJC008-A/2. 
Some photos were shot by one person and logged by another in 
the field. 
During the archiving period in Washington, all photos 
were 
moved 
into 
the files of the photographer who 
shot 
them. 
This 
left holes in some fieldworkers' numerical 
sequences, 
and 
added 
numbers to the end of others. 
Those rolls of film 
which 
were shot by more than one person were placed in the files of the 
5 
person 
who 
took most of the 
pictures. 
Naturally, 
while 
the 
overall 
order 
of 
photos 
within 
fieldworkers' 
sets 
is 
chronological, 
those racks that have been moved will not reflect 
shooting order. 
Affected sets are the following: 
CCC001 (now CET047) 
CCC002 (now CET048) 
CSS012 (now CJL045) 
CSS036 (now CJL046) 
CSS038 (now CET045) 
CSS039 (now CET046) 
BCC215421-07 (now BCF215421-07) 
BJL217770-08 (now BET217770-08) 
BMO217992-25 (now BBB217992-25) 
BET217770-02 (now BSS217770-02) 
The following black and white contact sheets are missing for 
unascertainable reasons: 
From Set #2: 
215661-01 through 07 
219399-01 
From Set #3: 
216898-08 
217991-01 
219399-01 
219500-06 
Set #1 is complete, and the negative collection is complete. 
The 
color slides have not been inventoried slide by 
slide, 
but 
there appear to be some missing slides whose absence 
cannot 
be adequately explained. 
Their number is small. 
6 
Recommendations 
for 
search procedures. 
There 
are a couple of suggestions we would like to make 
to 
improve the quality of search results. 
All of these ideas may be 
covered in the instructions for the machine, but in case they are 
not, we offer them here. 
If the singular rather than the plural of any given word 
is 
entered for searching, 
the results may be better. 
The 
computer 
will probably automatically find all plurals of the word. 
If the 
singular 
is 
treated 
as a root, 
("clam$$$" 
-- using 
symbols 
recognized 
by the computer as a request for all words 
beginning 
with 
"clam") 
the 
computer will bring 
up 
"clams" 
"clamming," 
"clammers," and "clammy," among other things. 
As the last 
term 
illustrates, 
some of the "hits" may not be what the searcher had 
in mind. 
The 
value of the root word approach can be seen with 
words 
like 
"history." 
A search term of "histor$$$" 
will 
bring 
up 
"history," 
"histories," 
"historical," "historian," 
"historic," 
"historiography," etc. 
Try 
alternate 
spellings 
and hyphenated versions 
of 
some 
words. 
For 
instance, 
a boat that breaks ice may 
be 
an 
ice 
breaker 
or an ice-breaker. 
(The hyphenated spelling occurs 
in 
some 
of 
Jens Lund's notes.) 
During editing we tried to 
remove 
all non-critical hyphens, 
but we may have missed some. 
In other 
cases, 
we 
did not know if the hyphen was necessary for 
correct 
spelling. 
For 
instance, 
not 
being familiar 
with 
biological 
names, we left the hyphens in words which Gene Hunn used, such as 
"ring-necked" 
and 
"rough-legged." 
Alternate spellings 
may 
be 
helpful 
in 
a search. 
We 
changed 
all 
"Hallowe'ens" 
to 
"Halloween." 
We 
may 
have missed other 
more 
subtle 
spelling 
variations on different words. 
We 
hope 
we 
have brought all the documents to a point 
of 
consistency 
that 
will 
help the search 
system 
perform 
at 
an 
optimum level. 
Any inconsistencies that remain may be the result 
of 
having 
several 
different people editing the 
documents 
and 
making changes in procedure during the editing period.

EDITING GUIDELINES 
February 15, 1984 
There are several areas of concern in 
editing the Pinelands 
Folklife 
Project data base. 
Each numbered section below is 
an 
editing task that probably should be tackled alone. 
Our editing 
will 
likely become sloppy if we try to combine too many 
editing 
tasks 
in one reading. 
It is very important that we be accurate 
and 
consistent. 
The 
order of priority for editing will be 
1. 
FNOTES 
2. 
RLOGS 
3. 
ALOGS 
4. 
CLOGS 
5. BLOGS 
6. Whatever is 
left. 
The 
exception to this will be the preparation of two 
or 
three 
edited 
disks (one each of Fnotes, 
Rlog, 
and 
Clog) 
for 
imminent use on the Onyx system by ASO. 
1. 
BASIC COPY EDITING. 
Spelling, typos. 
2. 
FIELD 
FORMAT, 
ACCURACY, 
AND CONSISTENCY. 
Check the 
following under each field designation: 
NAME: 
Change 
the marker from NAME: 
to NMO1:, 
NM02:, 
NM03, etc., using a separate numbered marker for 
each name. 
Documents with only one name on them 
should have only NMO1:. 
The format for entering 
names is as follows: 
Last name first, first name, 
(title) 
Street address 
City, State 
Zip Code 
If there is more than one name under this field, 
still 
use this stacked format and separate each 
entry by double-spacing. 
EVNT: 
A succinct 
description of what the event is. 
Use a stacked format. 
DATE: 
The 
format is two-digit numbers 
separated 
by 
slashes, 
month 
first. 
10/09/83. 
After each 
date, add a one- or two-word description of the 
event or location for that date, e.g. 
10/18/83 
(Webb home) 
10/19/83 
(picnic) 
This 
parenthetical information applies 
mostly 
to 
photo logs that have more than one date 
on 
them. 
INUM: 
Check 
for 
accuracy 
and 
inclusion 
of 
fieldworker's initials. 
On BLOGs, 
the number 
after 
the dash must be two digits. 
Insert 
a 
zero where necessary, 
e.g. 
215662-1 should be 
changed to 215662-01. 
Eliminate all dashes and 
spaces that are not standard. 
PHOT: 
Change 
to 
FWOR:, 
and move the logs into 
the 
files of the person who did the photography, or 
1 
most of it. 
When you do this, make a note on a 
master 
sheet on the wall so that the racks can 
be moved and renumbered. 
Add FWOR: to the IVIEW forms. 
It has been accidentally 
left off. 
3. 
GEOGRAPHIC 
CODES, 
KEYWORDS AND SUBFIELDS. 
This task 
involves reading for content and accuracy of information: 
Geographic 
codes 
Are 
they 
correct 
for 
the 
place 
being 
described? 
Correct 
format: 
[] 
for 
all 
codes. 
The 
tag 
should 
consist of a bracket, 
town 
or 
local 
place 
name, 
semi-colon, 
space, 
numerical 
township 
code, 
closing 
bracket. 
E.g., 
[Elwood; 
12]. 
At this point we think 
things like spaces and semi-colons are 
going 
to 
be important, 
or the machine won't 
read 
the information correctly. 
Keywords and subfields 
As 
you 
read, 
divide 
the 
content 
into 
subfields: 
one subfield per event or subject 
to 
the best of your ability. 
Each subfield 
will 
be 
set off from 
those 
preceding 
and 
following 
it 
by a double-spaced line and 
a 
marker 
at 
the beginning 
of 
the 
subfield: 
TXO1:, 
TX02:, 
TX03:, etc. 
Please make sure 
there 
are 
no double-spaces 
in 
a document 
except at breaks between subfields; 
also add 
the 
numbered text markers (all of the 
TEXT: 
field markers will have to be changed to 
the 
numbered versions shown above.) 
Each 
subfield 
should 
have 
a 
geographic 
code in square brackets s(mewhere in the text 
of that subfield. Most subfields will have at 
least 
one 
geographic tag. 
If there is 
no 
municipality 
code, 
type 
the 
name 
of 
the 
municipality 
into the slot where the 
number 
would ordinarily appear. 
As 
you read, 
notice which words in the text 
will help in a search for 
information on the 
subject 
being 
discussed. 
If 
you 
think a 
specific 
keyword 
should 
be included in the 
subfield, 
say 
"ethnicity," and it does 
not 
occur 
in 
the text 
as 
written, 
insert 
it 
either 
in 
the 
text or at the 
end 
of 
the 
paragraph 
or subfield. 
(The ideal 
location 
for such a word is as near as possible to the 
section 
of the text to which it relates.) 
A 
2 
keyword 
added 
in this manner 
should 
be 
added to the 
master list of keywords on 
the 
wall. This 
list will function as a reference 
list for searches, so add words when you 
see 
that 
they are necessary. 
We may substitute 
symbols that are easy to type for frequently-
used 
keywords like "plants," "animals," 
and 
"foodways." 
Stay tuned. 
4. 
SENSITIVE 
MATERIAL. 
All 
readings should 
include 
an 
awareness 
of sensitive material. 
If you come across 
something 
you 
think might be a candidate for slicing and 
dicing, 
make 
a 
note of it so we can discuss it.

The Mechanics of Team Research 
Sue Samuelson 
Folkloristic 
fieldwork 
in 
the 
United States 
tends 
to 
emphasize studies undertaken by 
researchers working alone. A 
folklorist decides on a topic of investigation, develops 
hypotheses or problem statements, selects a field site, conducts 
background research, 
and secures funding. Upon completion of the 
data collection phase there are reports to write and budgets to 
balance for grant agencies, then months or years of synthesis 
resulting in conference papers, journal articles, and books or 
monographs. The folklorist may circulate copies of the work in 
progress for commentary by his or her colleagues, 
but the 
research and its public presentation mainly rely on the effort 
put forth by one person. 
With the exception of 
occasional 
professor/ graduate student teams 
(e.g., 
the famed "Gary gang" at 
Indiana University whom Richard Dorson shepherded through the 
streets, homes and factories of Gary, Indiana) , large groups of 
researchers focusing on one area with collective thematic or 
topical interests emerge only rarely on the American folklore 
landscape. The American Folklife Center appears to be the lone, 
or at least the major, sponsor of such projects when they do 
occur. 
Despite a long history of library research and armchair 
theorizing, the lifeblood of folklore as a discipline is 
fieldwork. 
It is a frightening undertaking--to go to strange 
places, knock on unfamiliar doors, ask probing questios, seek 
acceptance, 
and wrestle with questions which beg to be answered 
but often yield insight only after the expenditure of much 
physical, intellectual, and emotional energy. Needless to say, 
the rewards are tremendously satisfying and warrant repeated 
fieldwork projects. The situation is especially true at the 
American Folklife Center, 
now completing its eighth major 
fieldwork project since 
1977. 
These forays range from the 
individualistic broadly-based surveys of the Chicago ethnic arts 
project, to the more team-oriented intensive surveys of the Blue 
Ridge Parkway, 
to the in-depth studies of 
life in Paradise 
Valley, Nevada. Some of their histories are outlined in Alan 
Jabbour's 1979 memo to the Board of Trustees, 
"Report and 
Recommendations on Fieldwork Topics." His summary covers the four 
projects initiated to that point and discusses 
(but 
is not 
limited to) 
such issues as participation by cooperating agencies, 
the strategy or focus of the studies, site selection, 
media 
documentation, 
product development, 
and the cohesiveness of the 
research team. 
It 
is 
the goal of this paper to review the 
mechanics of such group investigations, with more of an emphasis 
on administrative and personal or psychological components. It 
relies heavily on my own experiences as the administrative/ field 
coordinator for the Pinelands Folklife Project. 
Further 
interviews with Center staff and the coordinators of previous 
field projects are required before this discussion can be 
considered more complete. My intention is to provide some clues 
as to how the internal dynamics of team research affects a 
1 
project's conception, deployment and conclusions and how 
understanding such issues can have an impact on future field 
research sponsored by the Center (especially in a potential 
"Ethnographic Section" or "Survey of American Folklife") and by 
other agencies, foundations, educational institutions or less 
formally sponsored groups. 
Team Selection. Certain factors are basic to the selection 
of the research team. Usually a Center staff person (a folklife 
specialist) 
serves as the project's overall director but is 
assisted by an administrative coordinator who has 
primary 
responsibility for day to day activities in the field and pre-
and post-fieldwork duties such as arranging for transportation, 
lodging and supplies, 
inventorying the project archive, and 
assisting in writing the final report. Since the coordinator will 
also function as a parttime fieldworker the person occupying the 
position needs to possess good organizational and communications 
skills as well as have training in folklore. 
The selection of fulltime fieldworkers naturally depends on 
the orientation of the project as whole. Because of the Pinelands 
Folklife Project's (PFP) focus on the interplay between natural 
and cultural resources, fieldworkers were partly chosen on the 
basis of previous experience with similar kind of investigations. 
For example, Jens Lund's dissertation research on Ohio River 
fishing traditions was obviously applicable to his assignment in 
New Jersey to concentrate on baymen and their culture. Other 
attractive qualities for selecting team members include previous 
field research, 
public programming experience and publications 
(to demonstrate writing ability). Also important are hearty 
recommendations from teachers, employers and colleagues which 
indicate a strong degree of motivation, 
self-discipline and 
congeniality on the part of the prospective fieldworker. 
While advanced academic 
training 
is 
not 
an 
absolute 
prerequisite, most of the fieldworkers have Ph.D.s or M.A.s while 
others are advanced candidates for these degrees. Center projects 
are occasionally likened to postdoctoral appointments for newly-
minted Ph.D.s in which they are exposed to the work of public 
sector folklore on a national level gain proficiency in the use 
of documentary equipment, obtain administrative experience, and 
participate in an in-depth field project (especially important 
since funding for dissertation fieldwork becomes scarcer and 
students are forced to conduct library research or only limited 
field studies). The mix of people on project staffs varies. Some 
fieldworks are young 
(both chronologically and professionally), 
some more advanced. A team may include more men than women, or 
vice versa. According to Carl Fleischhauer, the Pinelands project 
had a larger percentage of women fieldworkers and staff members 
than has been the case in previous efforts 
A possible result of 
this situation was a perceived heightening of interest in ethical 
issues. Such concern may have also been due to the sensitivity of 
the area in which the project was taking place. The whole concept 
of the Pinelands National Reserve is very touchy to many of its 
residents, but there was considerable discussion of "the right 
thing to do" in regards to general presentation of self, behavior 
during interviews or photographic forays, and repercussions from 
public presentations. 
2 
The Pinelands project also employed several non-folklorists 
Interdisciplinary teams deserve more advocacy in Center 
fieldwork, 
just as the director indicated in his earlier report. 
In the case of 
the Pinelands, this approach was realized with 
the 
addition 
of 
an 
environmental 
psychologist and 
an 
ethnobiologist to the research team. In addition we had a very 
inquisitive 
photographer 
whose reasons 
for being 
selected 
extended beyond technical skill to his intellectual curiousity 
for understanding what we were doing as analysts of human 
behavior. 
His probing questions often forced researchers to 
define more clearly their own reasons for doing what they did and 
how they did it. 
On-site issues. All too often fieldwork guides skim over nuts 
and bolts issues relating to housing, 
travel, 
time off, 
and 
entertainment yet attention to these areas is crucial if a 
successful field project is to be the result. When folklorists 
work as a field team, they tend to live, eat and relax as group 
as well. This was certainly the case in the Pinelands where two 
of the fieldworkers lived in the building (a former house for a 
state forest superintendent) used as the project's headquarters 
while the other researchers lived across the road in apartments 
previously used by employees of a state school for the mentally 
retarded. There was plenty of opportunity for contact during the 
day, beginning with early morning congregations in the kitchen of 
the headquarters building to fix breakfasts, 
pack lunches, 
receive mail, 
and plan the day's activities setting out on 
interviews. Preparation of evening meals again offered a brief 
chance to touch base with one's co-workers. The researchers would 
then tackle logging or writing tasks before until the informal 
"quitting time" of 11:30 P. 
M. 
Thus the evenings definitely were 
as much a part of the work cycle as the daylight hours spent on 
the road. 
The PFP was especially complex in the ebb and flow of people 
present because of the use of University of Pennsylvania graduate 
students 
as 
parttime fieldworkers 
(project associates) 
and 
several 
non-folklorists 
as 
consultants. 
Some 
fieldworkers 
considered themselves "the core" because of their fulltime 
presence but the work schedules for the parttimers also 
coincided. The result was a work week in which the early part, 
Monday to Thursday, was much more tranquil than the weekends with 
the constant hum of activity resulting from the presence of as 
many as a dozen researchers. The upshot of this situation is that 
careful attention 
has to be paid to scheduling the use of 
equipment (cameras, 
tape recorders, word processors) and also to 
a smooth integration of fulltime and parttime people. 
Each 
researcher needs to be secure in his or her place on the team. An 
affiliated issue is the question of total size of the field team. 
One has to have enough people to assure that the goals of the 
project will be met but not so many as to be counterproductive 
because people are getting in each other's way. 
Another factor which can contribute to a pressure cooker 
kind of situation is failure to take time off from the demands of 
conducting 
an 
intensive 
folklife 
survey. 
In 
the Pinelands 
project, the fieldworkers rarely took time off. I do not think 
the situation was simply due to the relative isolation of the 
I 
project's headquarters in a rural area. Rather it had to do with 
1) the excitement and enthusiasm the researchers brought to their 
work; 
and 2) 
the latent feelings of competition between them to 
keep up with each other. Every person felt that she or he was 
surpassed by the others in terms of interviews, 
logging, or 
fieldnote writing. This escalation of work energy is discussed 
more fully below but for now it should be noted that 
a common 
suggestion in published fieldwork guides is that researchers take 
some 
time 
off 
in 
order 
to 
avoid burnout and possible 
physiological responses to stress, 
Furthermore, 
time away from 
the study allows people to tackle their work with renewed 
enthusiasm upon return and gain a fresh perspective on the issues 
at hand. In a short project though it is very easy to assume that 
there just is not enough time for such relaxation and that 
gathering the data is all-important. Such a goal is crucial, of 
course and 
there would be no project without lots of hard work. 
As with the team size issue, a point is reached where the payoff 
is no longer satisfactory. A tired fieldworker is not going to be 
a very productive one. The solution is to allocate free time, to 
build it into the project at an early stage, and recognize that 
it is an essential component of team research to have time away 
from each other and also to relax together as friends. 
Two other logistical issues warrant brief examination here. 
In the first of these, 
local travel, 
is relatively problem free. 
Except for their cost (roughly 13% of the budget) the five rental 
cars used on site were very handy. Care should be taken to use a 
leasing company that does not tack on a mileage charge. 
At 
approximately 5500 miles per car even a small mileage charge 
could quickly mount up, 
as is evidenced in the invoices for 
fieldworkers using their own cars. 
The second 
issue, 
that of 
payroll delays, 
is 
more 
problem matic. Because fieldworkers are still in school, have just 
recently graduated, or are bouncing from contract job to contract 
job due to the vagaries of the folklore job market, they may come 
to a Center field project with precious little money in their 
pockets. The Library's policy against giving advances is 
understandable, 
but coupled with the slowness of the process by 
which checks are issued 
(and the potential changes 
in the 
contracting procedure) should result in fieldworkers being warned 
about possible financial difficulties as 
early as 
the job 
interview stage. No one would want to dissuade applicants because 
of the financial situation but it is a definite problem that will 
not go away. It is a situation which contributes to the stress of 
the fieldwork setting and needs to be reassessed and possible 
solutions tested, 
such as establishing some sort of immediately 
disbursed fellowship or expense account under 
the 
project 
coordinator's control 
that could be 
reimbursed after a 
fieldworker receives a paycheck or two. 
In summary, what can be applied to team research in general 
from the specific experiences of the Pinelands Folklife Project's 
day to day encounters with administrative and logistical issues? 
The major contribution is a reinforcement of just how complex 
team research can be. 
While it 
is 
immensely rewarding and 
productive work it requires a high degree of organization. 
When 
up to a dozen, and occasionally more, people are working together 
A 
one will experience both the thrill of successful collaboration 
and the natural irritations attendant from the everyday living 
experience. Compounded by the fact that many researchers are used 
to working alone, either in the field or in writing and studying, 
there is a certain factor of inexperience which should be taken 
into coinsideration. While it is a novel situation and people 
tend to be on their best behavior, problems naturally arise. 
Again, the group as a whole tries to make allowance for these 
problems and if the research period is not extraordinarily long 
no 
situation should really have time 
to escalate. 
But 
administrators need to be aware of potentiasl difficulties and be 
certain to allow for some flexibility, especially in scheduling 
"mental health days," in selecting accomodations, and in 
determining the optimum team 
size. 
Work Patterns. 
At the begining of any project there is a 
settling in period during which team members are given 
instruction in the use of cameras and lights, 
recording 
equipment, and, in the case of the PFP, the microcomputers used 
as word processors. Also during this period, the Pinelands region 
was divided into four subsections to facilitate initial 
surveying. Each fieldworker was given a list of contacts compiled 
by the project's director. 
The researchers were expected to 
generate new contacts as well as by meeting 
with municipal 
officials, attending public events, and traveling the roads of 
their areas. 
During this period of immersion a delicate balance needs to 
be struck between mastering various technical components and the 
desire to head out into the field. There may be internal 
conflicts between eagerness to do the job one was hired to do 
but feeling something akin to stage fright. The field is full of 
surprizes and even the most experienced fieldworker may be 
tempted to delay testing the waters under the guise of 
preoccupation with logistical tasks. Once the initial contacts 
are made, however, things usually start to fall into place. In 
the case of the PFP, the director, Mary Hufford, wisely alloted a 
few days of soaking up the surroundings and then egged people on 
to start the actual fieldwork. 
The careful pacing introduced during the first week or so 
needs to be monitored throughout the project. A frequent 
complaint, 
particularly from non-folklorists on the field team, 
was the amount of time devoted to documentation, 
the 
work 
involving dubbing tapes, numbering slides, logging tapes and 
photos, writing fieldnotes, and printing and filing hard copies. 
Some of the burden can be lifted by hiring a parttime office 
worker to handle the more mundane tasks but the major chunk of 
the processing remains the responsibility of the fieldworkers. 
They are really the only ones who can log photos and write notes. 
Tape logging is more flexible but most folklorists are used to 
transcribing their own tapes. Despite the time factor they enjoy 
the opportunity to listen to the interview again when they can 
pay more attentionm to what was said without the 
many 
distractions of the recording situation. 
The fieldworkers assessed the ratio of writing hours to 
interview hours at roughly 3 to 1. That is, for every hour spent 
interviewing (and taping and photographing) there were three 
r, 
hours for writing fieldnotes and logging tapes and photos. This 
time spent in the office away from the more exciting field work 
was an irritant but generally recognized as a necessary part of 
the work load. It became more of a problem for parttime people 
who felt they needed to spend their few days in obviously 
productive work out in the field but gradually came to accept the 
office work. 
An offshoot of the parttimers' situation was a 
feeling on the part of the fulltime workers that they should be 
out interviewing too. 
The 
situation required some careful 
considerations of just who was doing what and scheduling 
activities so that not all of the researchers would be out of the 
office one day and clamoring for the transcribing machines or 
light boards the next. Generally things worked out pretty well 
except towards the end of the project when there was a heavy 
demand to finish logging tasks (see wrap-up section below). 
The PFP's team members were very concerned about keeping up 
with what they perceived as their "share of the work." Various 
people were perceived as team leaders in terms of the number of 
interviews they conducted, the thoroughness of their fieldnotes, 
and the precision with which they followed instructions for 
inserting keywords or geographic codes. When depositing tapes 
into the dubbing tray it was impossible not to note which numbers 
were on co-workers tape boxes. 
It was a very understated sort of 
thing, one not even really discussed openly until a few weeks 
into the project. Having read of similar problems developing 
during the Blue Ridge project I was attentive to such issues in 
the Pinelands and encouraged discussion of these problems. At 
first, we all laughed as we compared notes and found that in one 
category or another almost all of the people were considered some 
kind of leader. Awareness of the situation may have reduced the 
tension somewhat but the basic competitiveness continued. I do 
not know if there is any real solution to the problem and as long 
as 
it 
stays 
fairly low-key and 
is 
acknowledged by 
the 
participants, it should probably be taken more as a healthy sign 
than anything else. Still, care should be taken not to exploit 
the readiness to work hard. As was mentioned above, if more time-
off is built into the project that may be a good balance to the 
affirmed workaholism of the team members. 
An interesting complement to the competitiveness was a good 
deal 
of cooperation between fieldworkers in sharing their 
expertise on various issues. Some people had special talents for 
the recording equipment or for editing slides or for mastering 
the intricacies of the high-tech writing apparatus. They enjoyed 
passing on their knowledge in informal ways and such instruction 
was almost always appreciated by the learners who in turn could 
devise shortcuts of their own. It is not at all surprizing that 
the competitiveness and collaboration and affection of the 
researchers contributed to the development of the team's own 
folklore. 
Nicknames evolved, 
stories were retold, 
customs 
developed. A "visible proof" of such attachment was the project 
T-shirt suggested by one person, designed by another, and eagerly 
worn by all. 
Wrap-up. As much energy goes into "striking camp" at the end 
of a field project as is invested at its beginning. Particularly 
when one consideres the Center-based tasks of inventorying, 
archiving, and writing the post-fieldwork phase can seem 
interminable. On-site preparations for departure are fairly 
straightforward, 
mainly the 
reverse of 
pre-arrival 
issues 
relating to housing, packing equipment, arranging for delivery of 
final photos to fieldworkers' home addresses and the like. Then 
one realizes that not all logging tasks will be finished before 
departure so deadlines must be set for the receipt of finished 
fieldnotes, logs, contact sheets and final reports. There are 
also a myriad of details surrounding post-project evaluation 
meetings--circulating final reports and agendas, travel and hotel 
reservations, and dubbing missing tapes, all of which seem rather 
trivial but cannot be ignored and their time consumption factor 
should not be underestimated. 
There is often a need for short-term products based on the 
research. In the case of the PFP several°slide presentations were 
called for just two weeks after the fieldwork ended. 
This 
situation involved dissecting the photo collections and their 
corresponding logs before an inventory even began. 
It is 
essential therefore to have mutliple sets of logs so that one can 
be torn apart for various presentations and another intended to 
remain fairly intact for inventory purposes. Ultimately, all sets 
need to be accounted for so time should be alloted when the 
administrators' energies will focus on assessing the actual 
results before disseminating them any further. 
The next phase is then to decide on what products will 
result from the fieldwork. Sometimes it is helpful to produce 
something very quickly--a little photo essay, 
foodways booklet, 
summary report--so that the enthusiasm generated by the fieldwork 
can be tapped to support additional research to produce more 
complex items such as books and exhibits. 
Implications. Team research is not just the sum of the 
products of its individual workers. It involves much more than 
just collecting a group of folklorists, putting them in the same 
spot, 
and issuing directives on what they are to study. 
In 
European folklife surveys individuals may be in interested in 
vastly different topics and pool their findings in a book or 
conference that reveals their common ground to be only the 
locale, the space but not the place. The same can often be said 
about archaeological expeditions with their orientation toward 
"the site." While the goal is to achieve a coherent picture of 
life in a community over time the actual fieldwork is done in 
bits and pieces. 
Perhaps the closest analogy to folklife team research as 
engaged 
in 
by 
the Center 
is 
in 
the 
realm 
of 
physical 
anthropology. 
The interdisciplinary teams of specialists in 
paleontology, anatomy, geology, and zoology found toiling in such 
places as the Afar Triangle in Ethiopia offer an excellent 
example of how individual effort coupled with generous discussion 
time, not to mention good luck, results in the formation of 
complex propositions on the nature of 
man's evolution. 
In 
folklife, we are tackling not dissimilar issues--how people came 
to be they way they are and continue to behave as social beings. 
In some respects, team research is a justifiable excuse for 
a certain "existential fright." Because few folklorists have had 
experience with this kind of effort they do not know the 
specifics and worry about the generalities. But as more 
folklorists gain team experience the fear that is the result of 
ignorance 
should 
start 
to 
dissipate. 
Experienced team 
fieldworkers can pass along the benefits of their experience as 
coordinators of 
their own group projects and/or as repeat 
participants in Center projects. Indeed, it would be a serious 
loss not to capitalize on the pool of seasoned team researchers 
now being created via the Center's surveys. 
Despite seven years of team projects with almost an entirely 
different crew each time, 
the anticipated spillover of the 
teamwork approach has not appeared to any great extent in 
American folklife research. 
Perhaps such a situation is 
a 
function of time and money; 
it takes a signficant amount of each 
to create a project. Also, a good many folklorists have little 
interest 
in deploying the administrative skills which are 
absolutely necessary for a successful project. The ball still 
seems to be in the Center's court. Because of staff and funding 
resources, not mention its status as the principal agency for 
public 
sector 
folklore activities 
(and 
its 
connections 
to 
interested cooperating parties such as the National Park 
Service), the Center should consider assuming an even greater 
role in team projects, 
be they ongoing surveys of American 
communities and regions or more in-depth studies of particular 
phenomena and themes, or issues such as interpretation guidelines 
or land use recommendations. 
If the Center decides to assume such a role it would need to 
continue to develop a cadre of well-trained folklorists, 
interdiscplinary specialists, and experienced administrators. 
Naturally new recruits would always be desirable and possibly 
could be tappedwith apprenticeship or internship programs. Such 
resources would make an excllent base for a proposed "Survey of 
American Folklife" that would add more coherence to national 
folklife research. 
The team spirit evolves as a result of shared experience and 
common goals. 
It cannot be 
mandated but depends on an 
infrastructure that makes it possible for people to work and live 
together. The Center's success with team projects should not be 
taken for granted in American folklife studies, but rather seized 
as an excellent example of the validity and productivity of 
American folkloristics.

DIRECTOR'S COLUMN 
What is the state of folklore and folk-
life studies in the United States today? 
As the hundreth anniversary of the 
founding of the American Folklore So-
ciety approaches, many folklorists 
have fallen, quite appropriately, into 
an introspective, retrospective, and 
prospective revery. Where have we 
come from? Where are we now? And 
where are we going? These arc big 
questions; we are drawn to them, but 
we are understandably wary of gener-
alizing too expansively. Nevertheless, 
though angels have been cautious 
about treading here, I 
have resolved 
to rush in with a 
series of columns sur-
veying the state of our field today. 
But first a 
couple of caveats. When 
I 
say "our Held," I 
do not mean just 
the academic field (though the aca-
demic field is its core) nor even the 
larger field that includes both aca-
demic folklorists and all the profes-
sional folklorists employed by various 
agencies and organizations. Our total 
orbit is yet larger, including a 
variety 
of amateurs and enthusiasts and verg-
ing out into the larger public domain. 
Further, though my focus will be on 
the present state of affairs, I 
will glance 
back with regularity, and peer forward 
occasionally as well. Let's begin, then, 
with a 
quick turn of' the kaleidoscope 
to sample what seems worth a 
closer 
look. 
1 
. 
The list of states boasting a 
folk-
forte position within state government 
passes forty, headed for the magic 
number fifty (or more, adding terri-
torial folklorists). It now is reasonable 
to hope for at least one official folklor-
ist in every state. Of course, on closer 
inspection the list turns out to be less 
than tidy. Titles of state folklorists 
range from "folk arts coordinator" 
(the majority) to "director of' folklife 
programs." Their host agencies are all 
cultural agencies (mostly state arts 
councils), but institutional support is 
as varied as our states themselves. 
What is important is that they are a 
network, and they not only keep in 
touch and compare notes but actually 
collaborate on certain projects. Their 
emergence is paralleled by a 
rapid in-
crease in other nonacademic positions, 
particularly with museums, local arts 
councils, parks, historical societies, 
and other cultural organizations. Col-
lectively these positions now form a 
"wing" of the American Folklore So-
ciety—a public-sector wing balancing 
the academic wing. 
2. Terminology in our field remains 
fluid or confusing, depending upon 
your point of view. I 
am not speaking 
just of our debates about the microter-
minology of genres. Folklore remains 
the word of preference for our field of 
study, but folklife also has a 
following 
as the comprehensive term. Three fac-
tors seem to be simultaneously at play 
here. The federal agencies give a 
ma-
jor boost to the term folklife, and some 
state agencies and private organiza-
tions follow the federal model. Folk-
lorists in academic positions tend to 
prefer folklore, but even they hesitate 
when it comes to extending that term 
to material culture, and a 
few toy with 
folklife as the overarching term. To 
confuse matters further, some popu-
lar writings use folklife, perhaps be-
cause of the layers of unwanted 
meanings and associations that have 
accrued to folklore in the popular mind. 
Meanwhile, new general terms enter 
our professional parlance, notably 
public-sector (characterizing folkloric en-
deavors outside the academy) and cul-
tural 
conservation 
(referring 
to 
the 
cultural work itself, as opposed to the 
workers). 
3. The academic sphere of the pro-
fession, which previously seemed small 
but vigorous, enters a 
period of uncer-
tainty. A 
major graduate program in 
folklore, at the University of Texas, 
FOLKLIFF, CENTER NEWS 
enters into an attenuated recasting. 
Other academic programs wrestle with 
generational change or mobile faculty, 
but for some universities, like Utah 
State, the changes increase the folk-
loric presence. Ballad courses dwindle 
in number, but other subjects bur-
geon. The conceptual debates of the 
1970s subside a 
bit, but intellectual 
ferment bubbles away in the graduate 
folklore and folklife programs. 
4. Folk festivals (that is, intercul-
tural festivals organized by our field) 
continue to be popular. But after a 
bi-
centennial binge during which we per-
fected the genre—it can be called our 
gift to the nation's bicentennial—our 
field draws back a 
bit from its own cre-
ation in the post-bicentennial period. 
Several statewide and regional festivals 
are discontinued, not because they 
failed, but because of a 
certain restless-
ness on the part of organizers who 
wanted to do something else. A 
decade 
later, however, new experimental di-
rections in festival presentation suggest 
that the genre is again becoming a 
focus for the ideas and creativity of 
folklorists. 
5. Exhibits increase tremendously 
as a 
communicative medium of our 
field, almost as if some of the energies 
devoted to festivals in the 1970s mi-
grated to exhibits in the 1980s. The 
public-sector folklorists lead the way 
with a 
generation of what might be 
called "anthology exhibits"—exhibits 
highlighting, for example, the varied 
traditions of' the regions and ethnic 
groups within a 
state. Such antholo-
gies 
are gradually supplanted by 
another generation of exhibits with 
more focused themes. The collective 
sophistication of the field about exhi-
bits grows and spreads into its aca-
demic sector. A review of an exhibit 
appears in Journal of American Folklore, 
and the increased connections between 
folklorists and museums (an inevita-
ble result of our new attention to ex-
hibits) yields a new book entitled 
Folklife and Museums, 
6. Attention to our field continues 
to increase in the public media. Some 
of our academic wing-Jan Brunvand 
and Alan Dundes leap immediately to 
mind—become prominent in the na-
WINTER 1988 
tional media, appearing on television 
talk shows and being interviewed and 
reviewed in syndicated newspaper fea-
tures. 
The public-sector wing is 
equally active with publications and 
exhibitions that have occasional na-
tional impact and considerable re-
gional 
impact. 
For these accom-
plishments we can partly congratulate 
ourselves, but finally we must credit 
the powerful public interest in the sub-
ject matter we know most about. 
Hence one notices, in addition to pub-
lic pieces inspired by folklorists, a 
rise 
in pieces which explore our special 
subjects without consulting us. (In my 
arrogance I 
was astonished to read an 
extended essay on fiddling in The New 
Yorker that managed to be meticulously 
informed without asking me.) 
These are but glimpses into the ka-
leidoscope as it turns. But what are the 
patterns to it all? Are things getting 
better or worse for the field of folklore 
and folklife studies? Are there conspic-
uous new trends in our thinking? In 
our acting? What are the most impor-
tant developments in our field over the 
past generation? And, while we are 
thinking about ourselves, how are the 
cultural traditions faring that are our 
chosen focus of attention? Are they in 
danger from the larger forces of mod-
ern civilization, 
as our pessimist-
activists 
fear; 
is 
our civilization 
expanding its support of the cultural 
diversity necessary for folk traditions 
to flourish, as our optimists believe; or 
will the amount, function, and cultural 
value of folklore remain constant de-
spite our dithering, as the relativists 
among us aver? Such questions will be 
our cud in corning columns.

Lowell Study 
ing the National Folklife Festival in 
Lowell, 1987 through 1989, and the 
Smithsonian's Festival of American 
Folklife will feature Massachusetts, in-
cluding Lowell in 1988. 
Lowell was formerly one of the lead-
ing textile manufacturing centers in 
the world. Because of locally available 
waterpower (the city stands at the con-
fluence of the Concord and Merri-
mack rivers, twenty-five miles slightly 
northwest from Boston), huge textile 
mills were established there in the 
early part of the nineteenth century. 
Long known as the "Spindle City," 
Lowell continued to dominate the 
trade until the early 1900s, when corn-
petition from firms in the South re-
WINTER 1988 
sulted in the closing of many mills 
throughout New England. Lowell to-
day is an example both of a 
revitalized 
industrial city producing high-tech 
products and of an early American in-
dustrial town. The National Park 
Service has developed a 
historical Park 
at Lowell to interpret American indus-
trial history, and preservation efforts 
have contributed to revitalizing the 
city. An important cultural challenge 
for Lowell is to strengthen the links be-
tween its historic past and its present-
day cultural communities. 
"The 
theme of the Lowell Historic Preser-
vation Commission is 
`to 
tell 
the 
human story of the Industrial Revo-
lution,' and the Lowell Folklife Project 
will help us reveal, relate, and preserve 
more of that 
story," 
said 
Paul 
Marion, cultural affairs director of the 
Lowell Historic Preservation Commis-
sion and its chief liaison to the Folk-
life Center. 
For the Folklife Center, the Lowell 
Folklife Project is an opportunity to as-
sist in planning a 
community-based 
museum and to apply the skills and 
perspectives acquired during ten years 
of field projects to the study of an ur-
ban environment. The "model city" 
stature that Lowell has attained as a 
result of its restoration and public pro-
grams will be helpful in promulgating 
the conclusions and approaches of the 
project nationally.

In preparing for his role as field coordinator 
for the Lowell Folkli/e Project, Douglas 
DeNatale prepared a 
research plan from 
which the following article was adapted. 
The most dramatic evidence of re-
(-ent social change in Lowell, Massa-
chusetts, 
is 
in 
the diminishing 
availability 
of acceptable low-cost 
housing. Within it 
ten-year period, 
Lowell has ceased to be an economi-
cally depressed city, and its expand-
ing job market has attracted a 
new and 
affluent population. Housing costs 
have risen dramatically, and the area 
most affected is the inner city, which 
is undergoing rapid rene),val. One sec-
tion there, the "Acre,'' was named for 
the acre of' land donated to the Irish 
community in the nineteenth century 
by the mill companies for St. Patrick's 
Church. Adjacent to it is Little Cana-
da, named for its French Canadian 
settlers. Both sections have served as 
home for newly arrived immigrant 
groups, and today in addition to mem-
bers of the older groups the inhabi-
tants are a 
mixture of Hispanics and 
Southeast Asians. 
Urban renewal efforts during the 
1930s and the 1950s resulted in two 
large public housing projects in these 
sections. The North Common Hous-
ing Project in the Acre and the North 
Canal Housing Project (for which the 
Little Canada tenements were razed) 
have been a 
focus for conflict. The im-
proving property values have brought 
the threat of displacement to the cur-
rent residents, and in response, the 
Coalition for a 
Better Acre and the 
Ethnic Covenant have mounted cam-
paigns to maintain or construct low-
cost and decent public housing in the 
area. 
Lowell's inner city neighborhoods 
have witnessed a 
dramatic influx of 
Southeast Asians. Originally about 
one thousand Southeast Asians were 
placed in Lowell under the Refugee 
Resettlement Act. Lowell has since be-
come a 
magnet for people from other 
Laotian and Cambodian settlements, 
and new Southeast Asian families ar-
rive each week, placing pressure on 
existing housing and creating tensions 
with other residents. 
One arena for this tension is the 
public school. The influx of non-
English-speaking people has severely 
strained the schools' resources. As an 
interim measure, special schools were 
set up for Southeast Asian students, 
with Khmer-and Laotian-speaking 
teachers. 
This approach brought 
about the intercession of the state gov-
ernment, which ordered the main-
streaming of these 
students. A 
controversy over bilingual education 
ensued and continues as an issue 
today. 
The purpose of the Lowell Folklife 
Project is to collect information on eth-
nic and neighborhood life, with an em-
phasis on expressive 
traditions. 
Although a 
good deal has been done 
on the labor and social history of 
Lowell, there is comparatively little in-
formation on the expressive life of the 
city. The goal of the project is to 
gather information on present-day so-
cial realities. The easiest approach 
(and most obvious pitfall) would be to 
collect "ethnic folklore," to focus on 
the expressive items that stem from 
national culture or reflect ethnic iden-
tity. Such information would be use-
ful, of course, but it would also tend 
to equate national identity with ethnic-
ity and abstract expressive culture 
from the social and cultural realities of 
Lowell today.

In addressing both ethnic and social 
issues, the project will take as its theme 
the creation and maintenance of com-
munity space as defined in two ways, 
by group identity and by neighbor-
hood orientation. The basic questions 
of the first definition are: To what ex-
tent do individuals align themselves 
with an ethnic group identity, and 
what institutions maintain such an 
identity? Fieldworkers will focus on 
Irish, 
Greek, 
Portuguese, 
Puerto 
Rican, and Cambodian groups, which 
represent different periods of immigra-
tion and hold varying degrees of so-
cial power in the city. The basic 
questions of the second definition, by 
neighborhood orientation, are: How 
do people relate their sense of place to 
group identity, how do people lay 
claim to and bound their own space, 
and how do people interact in a 
par-
ticular space? For the task of answer-
ing these questions, the city will be 
divided into sections roughly accord-
ing to the widely accepted geographi-
cal 
designations: 
the Acre, 
the 
Highlands, Pawtucketville, Central-
ville, Back Central, and Belvidere. 
Each fieldworker will explore one of 
these sections, identify the cultural in-
stitutions of the area, interview the 
people 
involved, 
and photograph 
physical features and social life. 
In pursuing their investigations, 
fieldworkers will keep in mind a 
num-
ber of general questions: 
1. How does the environment of 
Lowell affect the practices of particu-
lar groups of people? The Southeast 
Asian community, for example, must 
adjust to a 
climate very different from 
their homeland. 
2. How do people conceive of the 
city's neighborhoods? Do these con-
ceptions vary from group to group? 
3. How do people establish terri-
torial hold on a 
particular section? 
What cultural forms of expression are 
used to delineate space? 
4. What happens when a 
commu-
nity breaks down? And what forces 
work to link disparate groups? 
5. What roles exist within particu-
lar communities, and how are these 
expressed? 
6. What institutions exist to pro-
mote group identity, and how are 
these institutions affected by spatial 
considerations and the passage of 
time.

PINELANDS STUDY PROVES RICH SOURCE 
During the winter and spring of 1987, 
the Pinelands Folklife Project cul-
minated in a 
spate of products and 
events, collaboratively orchestrated by 
state and federal agencies. The Pine-
lands Folklife Project archive was the 
starting point for these multiple pro-
ductions, yielding three book-length 
publications, it half-hour public net-
work television program, a 
major ex-
hibition, a 
scholarly conference, a 
series of educational workshops, and 
a 
reference archive. All of the pro-
ducers made use of this wellspring, 
contributing their own resources and 
further research for particular pro-
ductions. 
One Space, Many Places 
In December 1986 the Folklife Cen-
ter published One Space, Many Places: 
Folklife and Land Use in New Jersey's 
Pinelands National Reserae. Written by 
Mary Hufford, the 150-page book 
comprises the Center's final report 
and recommendations to the Pine-
lands Commission. The report de-
scribes 
elements of the 
region's 
folklife, relating them to the environ-
mental diversity that characterizes the 
National Reserve. The environmental 
planner's task is to understand the en-
vironmental values of the clients, in 
this case, the reserve's inhabitants and 
users. Such values often are richly ar-
ticulated in the kinds of expressions 
folklorists are trained to identify and 
interpret. Following this line of rea-
soning, the report recommends that 
the commission begin to rely on folk-
lorists and ethnographic methods to 
augment the methods used currently 
by other social scientists and natural-
ists. These points are illustrated with 
dozens of black-and-white photos, 
charts, and line drawings. The con-
cluding chapter elaborates on this gen-
eral recommendation and on ways of 
implementing it in New Jersey. 
Specifically, the Center made five 
recommendations: 
1. Hire a 
folklife specialist to serve 
as 
the 
staff cultural 
conservation 
planner; 
8 
2. Develop a 
clear focus for cultural 
conservation, centered on traditional 
land-use themes; 
3. Integrate internal approaches to 
the protection of all resources, com-
bining the perspectives of specialists in 
the sciences and humanities in the 
course of development review and 
public education; 
4. Coordinate the cultural conser-
vation effort with federal, state, and 
local agencies; and 
5. Add local representatives to the 
municipal planning boards to make 
formal cultural conservation nomina-
tions to the commission and to serve 
as folklife consultants in the develop-
ment review process. 
The most progress was made in the 
area of public education, which was 
the particular mission of the exhibit, 
book, video, conference, and work-
shops. But the effort to provide educa-
tional materials was not a 
one-time 
shot, for the commission's ongoing 
work has been affected as well. Last 
year the commission invited Rita 
Moonsammy, New Jersey's folk arts 
coordinator, to serve on its educational 
advisory council, and recently the 
commission hired folklorist Miriam 
Camitta to write the portion of its 
pilot curriculum for sixth graders that 
is 
devoted 
to 
the 
people of the 
Pinelands National Reserve. In addi-
tion to being folklorists, both Moon-
sammy and Camitta are professional 
teachers, so that in rendering their 
services they combine the perspectives 
of folklorist and educator.

dered from the Library of Congress,

New Jersey Pinelands: Tradition 
and Environment 
Three agencies in New Jersey's De-
partment of State took the initiative in 
producing an exhibition 
entitled 
"New Jersey Pinelands: Tradition 
and Environment." The exhibit and 
its related products were coordinated 
by Rita Moonsammy, folk arts coor-
dinator at the State Arts Council, 
David S. Cohen, who directs the Eth-
nic History Program at the Historical 
Commission, and Lorraine E. Wil-
liams, curator of archeology and eth-
nology for the State Museum, in 
consultation with Folklife Center staff 
and members of the field team for the 
Pinelands Folklife Project. 
As the title suggests, the exhibition 
focused on the relationship between 
regional culture and the natural envi-
ronment, with natural resources serv-
ing sometimes as cultural products 
themselves. The five major sections of 
the exhibit corresponded to Five envi-
ronmental subregions within which 
the region's culture has developed 
over the past three hundred years: 
pine and oak forests, cedar and hard-
wood swamps, salt and freshwater 
meadows, 
rivers 
and bays, 
and 
farmlands. 
While most of the objects came from 
the museum collection, many were 
also lent by local historical societies or 
obtained from home museums. Visi-
tors to the exhibit, a 
record-breaking 
fifty-six thousand in less than three 
months, were greeted by hundreds of 
artifacts, including Les Christoffer-
son's 112-room purple martin palace, 
Owen Carney's salt-hay ropemaking 
machine, Frank Astemborski's rail-
bird hunting skiff (meadows), tongs 
for clamming and oystering, split-oak 
pots for catching eels, miniatures of 
garveys and sneakboxes, the region's 
workboats (rivers and bays), June 
Taylor's sphagnum moss press, grave 
blankets made by Leo Landy of sphag-
num (swamps), knife handles and but-
tons made of deer antlers, 
glass 
pitchers made by Ted Ramp in his 
agricultural community of Taberna-
cle, historic and contemporary devices 
for harvesting and processing cranber-
ries, and Tom Brown's onion dotter 
(farmlands). 
Environments were invoked by par-
tially recreating, for example, a

life-
sized photo mural of a

sights of the environments filtered into 
the exhibit areas through video pre-
sentations. Visitors were also greeted 
by life-sized black-and-white cut-outs 
of Pinelands residents clamming, pol-
ing railbird skiffs, foxhunting, and sit-
ting in their homes. Artifacts and 
photographs presented within each 
section of the exhibit were richly con-
textualized by the videotapes and pre-
sentations by scholars and tradition 
bearers. 
Pinefest, Workshops, and Lecture 
Series 
On January 31, 1987, the exhibit 
WINTER 1988 
formally opened with a 
"Pinefest," a 
day-long celebration featuring the 
craftspeople, musicians, and other tra-
dition bearers whose lifeways were to 
be on display there until April 5. The 
exhibit, which was the largest ever 
produced at the State Museum, occu-
pied the entire ground floor, some five 
thousand square feet. With a 
record-
breaking attendance of five thousand 
people on the 
opening day, 
the 
"Pinefest" packed them in at a 
rate 
of one person per square foot. 
Through the "Pinefest" and the 
workshops coordinated by folklorist 
Miriam Camitta, tradition bearers 
illuminated the exhibit throughout its 
two-and-a-half-month duration, 
bringing each section to life through 
demonstrations and workshops on 
lumbering, floral gathering and proc-
essing, quilting, decoy carving, boat-
building, birdhouse construction and 
use, charcoal making, and the culti-
vation of indigenous crops like cran-
berries, blueberries, and salt hay. 
While the 
folklife 
presentations 
provided a 
native, sense-of-place per-
spective on the region, they were aug-
mented by historic and scientific 
perspectives presented in a 
Sunday 
lecture series on glassmaking, iron 
manufacturing, decoy carving, and 
Pine Barrens floral diversity. 
In addition to the workshops and 
lectures, the museum ran ongoing ed-
ucational programs on the region's 
culture and ecology, tailored, by re-
quest, to students from grades three to 
twelve.

Pinclands Sketches 
Some of' the sounds and sights of 
each environmental subsection poured 
into the museum through five video 
monitors. Viewers were introduced to 
the reserve's varied habitats through 
the eyes and words of native guides 
who narrated and demonstrated tradi-
tional activities found in each habitat. 
"Ken Camp: Railbirding Guide" 
opened up the freshwater meadows 
along the Maurice River; "Norman 
Taylor: Fox Hunter" offered an in-
sider's view of the pine and oak up-
lands in Lebanon State Forest; "Cliff 
and Steve Frazee: Cedar Farmers," 
took viewers into a Forked River 
Swamp; "Stephen Lee: Cranberry 
Grower" explored a 
Chatsworth fam-
ily's indigenous fanning practice; and 
"Joe Reid: Garvey Builder" showed 
the 
vital 
link between the cedar 
swamps and the clamming tradition of 
Barnegat Bay. 
The videos were produced by the 
exhibit coordinators, the consultants 
from the original field team, and film-
maker Lou Presty of New 
Jersey Net-
work Public Television. 
Presty 
produced a final 
version 
entitled 
"Pinclands Sketches" that premiered 
on New Jersey public television on 
March 27, 1987. 
Pinelands Folklife 
If the media presentations, speak-
ers, and demonstrators brought the 
exhibit to life, Pinelands Folklife, a 
book 
published by Rutgers University Press 
to accompany the exhibit, will keep 
the exhibit concepts alive long after its 
closing on April 5. Edited by the proj-
ect's three coordinators, Pinelands Folk-
life challenges the commonly held 
stereotype of' a 
region sparsely popu-
lated with quaint, backwoods people, 
documenting instead a 
region rich in 
cultural and environmental diversity. 
The 234-page book contains a 
fore-
word by Alan Jabbour, an introduc-
tion by the editors, and three major 
essays on the region's culture from his-
toric and contemporary perspectives. 
In the opening essay, "Telling the 
Landscape: Folklife Expressions and 
Sense: of' Place," Mary Hufford ex-
plores landscape images and interpre-
10 
tations as they are formalized in the 
region's material and verbal tradi-
tions. In the second essay, human 
ecologist John Sinton traces the history 
of these landscapes, in which one can 
read the story of heavy human use 
over the past three centuries. The con-
cluding essay by Rita Moonsammy, 
David Cohen, and Mary Hufford in-
troduces readers to traditional activi-
ties, both historic and contemporary, 
found within each of the five kinds of 
habitat covered by the exhibit. 
The book is lushly illustrated with 
one hundred photographs, ten of 
which are color plates. The photo-
graphs are from the Pinelands Folk-
life 
Project, 
supplemented with 
historic and contemporary images 
from state and local collections. 
Pinelands Folklife Conference 
On March 14 the Pinelands Com-
mission, together with the exhibit's co-
producers, 
sponsored a day-long 
conference at the museum, with the 
help of a 
grant from the New Jersey 
Committee for the Humanities. The 
conference augmented the lecture and 
workshop series by providing a 
forum 
in which scholars and members of the 
general public could exchange views 
on the interrelation of folklore, ecol-
ogy, and land-use in the region. The 
museum's auditorium was full, with 
about 250 people in attendance, many 
of' them teachers, environmental en-
thusiasts, local history buffs, 
state 
agency representatives, and other pro-
fessional researchers. 
Those assembled were welcomed 
with remarks from John Stokes, the 
Pinelands Commission's administra-
tive assistant, Bernard Bush, director 
of the New Jersey Historical Commis-
sion, and Mary Hufford. Sessions 
were chaired by Elizabeth Carpenter 
of the Pinelands Commission, Angus 
Gillespie of Rutgers University, David 
Cohen, Lorraine Williams, and Rita 
Moonsammy. 
Mary Hufford and John Sinton 
opened the conference with discussions 
on the interrelation of folklore and 
ecology. Eugene Hunn spoke on the 
organization of local knowledge of 
plants and animals, Mal O'Connor on 
technological innovation and family 
business, Tom Carroll on the decoy 
"as necessity," Elaine Thatcher on 
woodlands yardscapes, Jens Lund on 
the environmental experience narra-
tives of outdoorsmen, Bonnie Blair 
O'Connor on the regional identity of 
the reserve's Puerto Rican population, 
Nora Rubinstein on piney identity, 
and Sue Samuelson on the effect of the 
Pinelands National Reserve on re-
gional identity. 
New Jersey Folklife: Special 
Pinelands Issue 
The papers presented by Hufford, 
Thatcher, O'Connor, and Lund at the 
conference appeared six weeks later in 
the 1987 issue of New Jersey Folklife, 
which was devoted to research in the 
Pinelands 
National 
Reserve. 
Sue 
Samuelson was guest editor for this 
volume of the New Jersey Folklore So-
ciety's official periodical. In addition 
to the conference papers, the volume 
contains an article by Sue Samuelson 
on regional festivals and celebrations 
and an article by Rita Moonsammy on 
symbolic aspects of the Delaware Bay 
oyster schooner. 
,Fhe volume is 
illustrated 
with 
black-and-white photos from the 
Pinclands Folklife Project. It is dedi-
cated to Christine Cartwright, a 
mem-
ber of the field team who was killed in 
a 
traffic accident shortly before the in-
itial round of fieldwork ended in 1983. 
Reference Archive 
The final product to emerge from 
the Pinclands Folklife Project will be 
a 
reference archive, to be deposited at 
the State Library in Trenton. While 
all of the original materials will remain 
at the Center's Archive of Folk Cul-
ture, a 
complete set of duplicate sound 
recordings and photographic images 
will be housed in the State Library's 
New Jersey collection, together with 
a 
copy of all written documentation, 
comprising thousands of pages of field-
notes, logs of recorded sounds and 
photographic images, and a 
compre-
hensive inventory of'all materials held 
at the Center. When the reference ar-
chive has made its way to Trenton in 
1988, the Pinelands Folklife Project 
will come to an end.

A DIRECTORY OF QUILT COLLECTIONS NOW AVAILABLE 
The Joseph Silbernagel family, Beiseker, Alberta, pose before a

The Library of Congress, in cooper-
ation with Acropolis Books Ltd. of 
Washington, D.C., has just published 
Quilt 
Collections: A Directory for the 
United States and Canada. The work is 
the result of several years of survey-
ing and compiling information from 
more than seven hundred institutions. 
In September 1985, the Folklife 
Center mailed 2,700 three-page ques-
tionnaire survey forms to quilt, textile, 
folk, and decorative arts museums, 
and to corporations, universities, li-
braries, and archives. By February 
1987, there were responses from 747 
significant quilt and quilt-related col-
lections. An additional 130 collections 
of less than five quilts, or with less sig-
nificant documentation holdings, also 
responded. Three hundred thirty insti-
tutions reported no quilt holdings. The 
compilation is the most comprehensive 
WINTER 1988 
to date but cannot be regarded as ex-
haustive. The survey will be updated, 
and the Center welcomes information 
from collections that are not included 
here. 
The directory was compiled by Lisa 
Turner Oshins, program specialist at 
the Folklife Center, who has written 
an introduction to the volume. Organ-
ized by country, state, and city, and 
alphabetically by institution, the en-
tries provide detailed information on 
particular collections, as well as loca-
tion and visiting hours. Also included 
are an index of participating insti-
tutions, a selected bibliography, a 
sample of the questionnaire form used 
in conducting the survey, a 
glossary, 
a section on quilt conservation, a 
selected filmography, and two listings: 
one of statewide and regional quilt 
documentation projects and the other 
of major national and regional quilt 
organizations. 
The volume is illustrated with six-
teen full-color pages and thirty-eight 
black-and-white photographs present-
ing 
quilts 
themselves and docu-
menting the history and uses of quilts. 
The photographic collections of the Li-
brary of Congress were a primary 
source of illustrations for the directory, 
and along with illustrations from 
many other institutions show a 
diver-
sity of types from many areas.

LIBRARY OF CONGRESS 
Folklife Annual 1986, second in the se-
ries from the Center, presents a 
col-
lection of articles on such diverse 
topics as breakdancers in New York 
City, Peruvian Indians on the slopes 
of the Andes, and Finns in their home-
land and in America. Several articles 
explore the history and present-day 
uses of the Kalevala, the Finnish na-
tional epic, 150 years after its publi-
cation; 
one presents a series 
of 
lumber-camp photographs from the 
Library's Farm Security Administra-
tion collection; and in another a 
hard-
working man from Michigan's Upper 
Peninsula tells his story, with com-
ments by seven folklorists. 
The articles demonstrate the vari-
ety of folk communities but also reveal 
their unexpected similarities, and sev-
eral delineate the consequences of 
an encounter between an outside 
observer-researcher and the commu-
nity observed. In these the photogra-
pher or folklorist discovers that the 
effect of his or her own involvement 
with community or material cannot be 
discounted. Many who have done 
fieldwork will see their experiences and 
problems reflected here, the difficulty 
of identifying a 
"pure" folk commu-
nity, for example, and of sorting out 
the influences of radio, television, and 
public education. 
Edited by Alan Jabbour and James 
Hardin, Folklife Annual was begun in 
1985 to present a 
yearly collection of 
illustrated articles on the traditional 
life and culture of the American peo-
ple and to provide a 
forum for the dis-
cussion 
of theories, 
issues, 
and 
procedures of' folklife study. The an-
nual seeks a wide audience for its 
presentation of American traditions 
and values. Folklife Annual 1986 in-
cludes 103 illustrations, 29 in full 
color.

would be happy to read any others. 
The annual is especially well suited for 
presenting those articles that require 
illustration. 
From "Among the Qeros" by John

Increasingly now tourism in the 
Third World has become an indus-
try that converts folklore and native 
culture into commodities. Culture is 
up for sale, and in Punto, "The 
Peruvian City of Folklore," every 
guide is a 
folklorist, every restaurant 
performs "authentic music," and 
city dwellers have become experts 
and explainers of country life.

From "Minnesota Logging Camp, 
September 1937" by Carl Fleisch-
hauer, Beverly W. Brannan, and 
Claudine Weatherford 
It is impossible to see this series of 
pictures either as a 
statement about 
"the logging problem" or as an in-
dictment of railroad-building robber 
barons. And, although the lumberjacks 
may have been underpaid and over-
worked, our present-day examination 
of Lee's empathetic photographs re-
veals only a 
group of hard-working and 
hard-playing men.

FOLK ARCHIVE MOVES 
TOWARD AUTOMATION 
The Folklife Center's Archive of 
Folk Culture recently passed an im-
portant milestone on the road toward 
automated collection control with the 
preparation of'a computer printed cat-
alog for the eighteen hundred books in 
its reading room. 
Archivist Marsha Maguire pro-
duced the five-volume finding aid on 
the Library's mainframe computer, 
using the ROSCOE and JANUS ap-
plications programs. The first four vol-
umes provide a 
dictionary display of 
authors, titles, and official Library of 
Congress subject entries drawn from 
MARC records. The fifth volume pro-
vides what are essentially bibliogra-
phies of the Archive reading room's 
books on specific topics, e.g., "Folk-
tale," "Protest," "West Indies," and 
"Ethnomusicology." 
Seventy-six such topics formerly 
served as shelf locations for the read-
ing room. Now, by retaining these lo-
cally relevant subject headings in 
volume 5 
of the print-out, the Archive 
has been able to reshelve its books in 
professional, shclflist order, and yet 
continue to serve the needs of a 
sophis-
ticated readership with its own elab-
orate and established terminology. 
A 
by-product of putting the books 
in proper shclflist order has been the 
opportunity afforded the Collections 
Maintenance staff to remove the read-
ing room's old, inefficient storage 
units and replace them with modern 
shelving. From start to finish, the 
move took less than two days. 
The Archive has now completed a 
second phase in the evolution of its 
automated facilities, the creation of a 
local on-line catalog for books. This 
database employs MARC records 
downloaded from the same mainframe 
computer tapes that were used to gen-
erate the printed catalog. Because it 
resides on an Archive microcomputer, 
the database offers fast and flexible 
processing as books are added to, or 
removed from, the reading room 
shelves. It has also facilitated the ex-
pansion of catalog control to the Ar-
chive's large 
holdings of serial 
publications (many of which are found 
nowhere else within the Library of 
Congress). Finally, this local catalog 
14 
allows Archive patrons with special-
ized 
needs 
to 
perform on-line 
searching. 
One aspect of this project has been 
the attention it has focused on the spe-
cial challenge in providing subject ac-
cess 
to 
ethnological 
collections. 
Undoubtedly, the experience gained 
in addressing this issue within the do-
main of published books will provide 
a 
foundation on which to build auto-
mated control over the Archive's 
holdings of unpublished special mater-
ials—materials that now comprise 
some thirty-five thousand hours of 
sound recording, one hundred thou-
sand photographs, and two hundred 
thousand manuscript pages. 
Other contributors to this project 
were Bob Palian of the Music Divi-
sion, Joe Marsala and Claudia 
McNellis of the Automated Systems 
Office, Pamela Posey, formerly of the 
European Reading Room, Jozef 
Topolski of the Photoduplication Serv-
ice, and Peter Bartis, Carl Fleisch-
hauer, Aldona Joseph, Gerald 
Parsons, and Victoria Pendleton, all 
of the Folklife Center.

FOLK ARCHIVE INCLUDES 
PINY DATABASE 
The PINY database, at the Archive 
of Folk Culture, named for the resi-
dents of the Pinelands National Re-
serve, contains in its memory 37,204 
words that run at fractions of a 
second. 
Mornings, chickens, flea markets, and 
roads are among the subjects included 
from those identified by fieldworkers 
during the Pinelands Folklife Project. 
PINY comprises 1,521 documents, in-
cluding fieldnotes, detailed logs of 
sound recordings, and illustrative pho-
tographic images. 
"Searching through PINY," says 
Mary Hufford, director of the Cen-
ter's Pinelands Project, "is like doing 
fieldwork again, since you have to 
think in terms of the way people would 
talk rather than the way an indexer 
would reorganize the same material." 
The computer database is a 
collec-
tion of information organized for rapid 
and easy retrieval. Documents are or-
ganized in sequence such as alphabet-
ical or numerical order, just as folders 
are stored in a filing cabinet. In 
searching a 
file cabinet, you must pass 
over the folder that contains "crabs" 
information to locate the folder for 
"firefighters." A computer does the 
same thing 
faster. 
And free-text 
searching, as its name implies, permits 
the search of all terms in the database 
without the subjectivity that accompa-
nies tiling. Because information in the 
"firefighters" folder may overlap with 
that in "crabs" (if, for example, a 
fire-
fighter told a 
fieldworker about a 
spe-
cial way of cooking crabs "a la 
firefighter"), the information is usu-
ally kept in one of the folders rather 
than in both and then may be missed 
in quick researches. 
If this article were part of a 
free-text 
database, and the reader wanted to 
know about PINY, he would simply 
type the name and the computer 
would retrieve the number of times the 
word occurs. Like darts that target the 
center of the board, pointers for each 
word indicate its occurrence. Pointers 
are stored in a 
dictionary file or list of 
all the terms. The computer consults 
the dictionary each time a 
search is re-
quested. Computer jargon for a 
ques-
tion is query. The list or history of 
queries is kept in the memory of the 
computer while the researcher is con-
ducting what may be considered an in-
terview. 
Using simple commands, the re-
searcher can display on the computer 
screen the paragraphs or the entire 
document in which the word or answer 
to the question appears. Thanks to the 
dictionary, not only individual words 
but words in relation to one another 
can be addressed by the researcher. If 
the reader wants details about agricul-
ture in Chatsworth, where cranberries 
are cultivated, by combining Chats-
worth and cranberry, not necessarily with 
the term agriculture, he may find infor-
mation about the topic. A 
search can 
be limited to the occurrence of the 
terms in the same sentence, para-
graph, or document. 
On the other hand, the sequential 
file-type database will only indicate the 
appearance of a 
concept once the 
name or term appears explicitly as it 
is known, e.g., agriculture as agricul-
ture, not as the activity of cultivating 
the soil, producing or raising crops. 
For PINY, part of the document 
information was planned in advance.

Dates, places, names of fleldworkers, 
technical information, and item num-
bers were entered at the time data was 
collected. This information may be 
searched and clustered in subsets for 
further and faster analysis because the 
computer has only to consult the clic-
tionary pointers of' the subset instead 
of the complete database. 
Let us suppose the reader wants to 
know about black-and-white pictures 
of canned goods prepared by Helen 
Zimmer. `Black.FRMT" will iden-
tify 
all 
the documents containing 
black-and-white pictures and "Zim-
mer," the documents in which this 
name appears. Thus combining both 
will retrieve all black-and-white pic-
tures in which Zimmer was photo-
graphed. Furthermore, combining this 
subset with a 
set of all documents in 
which canned is adjacent to the word 
goods will yield the exact number of 
times the 
phrase appears in 
the 
database. 
Because of the free-text database 
format in which PINY was created, as 
Hufford says, "more raw materials, 
for example, concepts such as policy, 
are searchable by definition and appli-
cation, an advantage over the years 
because it permits flexibility in lan-
guage. Thus, horizons are un-
limited." 
The automation process may be ex-
pensive and complicated, and master-
ing the computer and its processes is 
not easy. But, Hufford concluded, as 
an experiment in technology it was 
well worthwhile.

FOLKLIFE CENTER BOARD 
MEETS AT SEVERAL LOCALES 
The American Folklife Center's 
Board of Trustees held its fall 1986 
meeting, October 1-5, in South Caro-
lina, at several points on the coastline, 
beginning in 1 
awley's Island and end-
ing in historic Charleston. The board 
meeting was convened at the Brook-
green Gardens Conference Center, 
and the board and Center staff mem-
bers participated in the all-day confer-
ence "Fifty Years of Folklore Research 
in South Carolina" at the Kimbel 
Conference Center of the Belle W. 
Baruch Institute for Marine Biology. 
Local arrangements were made by 
board member William Kinney, his 
wife, Peggy, and the staff at the 
McKissick Museum. 
In addition to several days of delib-
eration on matters of official concern 
to the board and staff, participants 
were given an introduction to the 
varied 
traditions and cultures 
of 
coastal South Carolina. The trip to 
Charleston included a 
visit with Mary 
Jane Bennett, one of the many sweet-
grass basket weavers in the area, and 
an opportunity to meet Philip Sim-
mons, the noted Charleston black-
smith. Simmons's work was evident 
throughout the city on the walking 
tour guided by folklorist John Vlach. 
For winter and spring meetings, 
1987, 
the board returned to 
the 
Library of Congress on March 2-3 
and June 11-12. The March meeting 
was presided over by the new chair-
man, William Kinney of South Caro-
lina, and the board took the occasion 
to express its thanks to the retiring 
Librarian of Congress, Daniel J. Boor-

stin, for his interest in and support of 
the Center since its creation in 1976. 
The fall 1987 meeting of the Cen-
ter's Board of Trustees was held in 
Lowell, 
Massachusetts, 
September 
24-25, where the Lowell Folklife Proj-
ect was under way. In addition to its 
regular activities, the board had an op-
portunity to witness a 
field project 
firsthand. Project coordinator Doug-
las DeNatale gave a 
tour of the neigh-
borhoods being studied, 
which 
included a 
visit to the Trairatanaran 
Buddhist Temple, and the board also 
toured facilities of the National Histor-
ical Park.
