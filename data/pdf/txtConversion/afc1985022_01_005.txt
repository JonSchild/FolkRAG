TEXT: 
DC: This is a picture taken from the sea in 1984, this is 
the little village, 350 people live here full-time, a lot of 
tourists come here in the summertime. 
All these homes have 
people that have been back and forth here in America, and talkin 
about Mama's grandfather, left America to go back to Yugoslavia 
in 1892, and with three brothers -- and also her father's three 
brothers were here with them and went back, and it's just a --
MH: The name of the town? 
DC: Igrane -- but in this Dalmatian Coast this would be 
taken off a different angle -- you got a highway runs parallel to 
the coast, and a bunch of picturesque villages all along the 
coast, it's comparable to the French Riviera. 
Well from here to 
this Island is 6 miles and to the Peljesac Peninsula is 12 
miles but by car it's 75 miles, real rocky terrain and it takes 
you, about 4 hours -- but your Yugoslays in Louisiar-•a have corns 
from this Markuska (?) throughout this Peljesac Peninsula all 
within say a 40 mile area -- -all the Yugoslays°that are here are 
from little villages all along there. 
It's on the Adriatic Sea, an offshoot of the. Mediterranean. 
' TTs So the majority of the Yugoslays come from this small 
"DC: A forty mile strip.'- Like with this town ycsu have the 
M40^oviches, Loyiches, Ant iciches. Tal ianciches, Paruns, the 
Pobrica", and the nex t town over you 
z_ 
have the Franicevihes, the',)  
Glemozina (?) and furl:hP?r &—wn :you have the NNres •?) where t 
rivor} , valley is, 
it's a flatland comparative to Louisiana, a 
Delta•-type -<- a lot of your present day oyster fishe r men are from 
th6r^e -=- and it's Pel ;lesac Peninsula, and Your•Peljesac Peninsula 
y6u 'v 
kiae Stan, Trpan j , Igrane, Arabich (?) and this island is 
Hvar` - -- 
LFPAMH001 
and you have another island !' orcu1a, and Y.orcu1a is where Marco 
Polo was born, 
under the Venetian flag. This was all part of the 
Venetian Empire years back. 
The next town over is Zivagosha (?) and there's Drashniza, 
there's '1 
uchape, Makarsk.a 
Ya'll've heard of Dubrovnik, well he lives in Dubrovnik and 
Dubrovnik is maybe 80 miles southeast of here and all along this 
coast -- But now you get where the land forms this peninsula you 
have Ston, 
I 
roanj, Duba, that's where yr w --& :liana oyster 
indmstry is still centered -- with the petroviches, Sabliches, 
JT•riches. 
Tomasovich, Popich families -- they're all from this 
area. 
r  
MH: So do the settlements here match the settlements there? 
Do the same groups of People cluster together? 
DC: More or less, 
but like in the 20s you had a bunch of 
People that created the orange industry in Plaquemines -- you had 
the Luliches, Cvitanovich, Pevacn, Sumich, Vela 
Mrs. C ( his mother): Franceski 
DC: but Franceski wasn't part of that group -- let me talk 
-- the way Franceski got there was they married into that -- but 
these people from Podgora and Igrane were the nucleus of the 
orange industry and they bought a big farm, 
from Dr. 
Booth above 
Fort Jackson, and this farm was several thousand acres and the 
Pevatz and the Lul aches were Pioneers in the orange farming 
industry, and they made orange wine up until Hurricane Betsy in 
1 65. 
MN: Do they nave oranges` in Yugoslavia? 
DC: Nope -- but they have grapes, they are very fine 
winemakers with the grapes and this is very fine olive -- the 
biggest farm Products were olives, 
Drapes, and figs. 
There's a 
rocky terrain there that limits orange production, 
and also the 
fishermen that came here, they fished sardines and different 
other fish in the sea over there. 
MH: Uid anyone try to grow grapes here 
DC: Yeah, 
it:'s too numi.d. 
Over there it's drier. 
MH: What about the oyster industry -- is that similar? 
DC; in Yugoslavia there's hardly any oyster industry at all 
-- lugOslays are good seamen, and in the west coast they all did 
tuna -- in the U.S. the best tuna fleets are all Yugoslav 
fishermen -- the scallop fleets on the east coast are all 
Yugoslav fishermen, so they are versatile all around fishermen. 
the shrimp fleet In Biloxi for years and years was Yugoslav untip 
recently the Vietnamese took over the shrimp industry. 
But the 
oyster industry is a profitable business, a hard business, ano 
the locals, the natives here were more or less in the oyster 
business as a hit or miss deal, 
and the Yugoslays are the ones 
that capitalized it
-and made it a big 
industry. 
MH: Were there always  a lot •• f oysters 
ers down here? 
DC: Well, there was oysters here, 
like the first Yugoslays 
that came here, 
they dumped ship, 
and they came in the 1840s 
before the Civil War -- anc they worked by hmnd anL last moved 
oysters from one reef to another 
and they just perfected this 
business all along and any modern innovations that carne to the 
oysterin industry came on account Of Yugoslav fishermen in the 
industry ----
;
:r 
LFPAMH001 
Ha - Are oysters th`p`° same the world over? 
<- 
DC: No, not really, like in vu 
is a Small oyster, 
no nearly the quality of oyster that you have here. Th ere 's 
oysters on the Pacific Coast, there's oysters in Japan and Korea 
there's Oysters in Mexico and South America, but I guess we're 
Just prejudiced -- we have a favorable oyster -- it's a fatter 
oyster and also a better flavor, but on the Pacific Coast they 
have an oyster that tastes fishy -- it's not a good oyster 
product to eat raw, whereas Louisiana oysters are renown e d th e 
z 
world over. _ 
..You see trucks gain every day from here gain to New 
Jersey, Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina 
but 
you 
trucks bringing their o ys ters in here, so•evidentlydan t have any 
MH: How about techniques on muddy ground here as opposed to 
rocky ground there? 
DC: You've got -- like on the Atlantic Coast, everything's 
by dredge -- either dredge or tonging. 
It's the same thing here. 
Mexico it's rocky, you can't use the same kind of dredges or-
tongs, so you have to dive for ' em and it's real hard to get 
oysters in Mexico, but -- it's virtually the same thing -- a 
boat operates in a circular motion and the dredges pick up from 
one side to the other 
it's the same on the east coast it's the 
same on the Gulf coast -- 
I don't know how they do it an the 
west coast -- but it's still the same thing 
MH: Do they still use tangs? 
DC: Oh, they still use tongs, but it's not nearly as popular - 
as the dredging 
MH: Did your family came over here in the 18OOs? 
DC: No, my family, we're back and forth -- which my great •• 
grandfather was here -- I guess they carne in the time of the 
L X`• 
civil war 
and they left in 1692, and then my grandfather's 
1 
brothers carne here in the early 19OOs -- one carne in 1904 
another one carne in 1907 -- and we had -- ' 
their uncle brought ern 
here and he died here -- he came here right after the Civil War 
also -- and my grandfather on my mother's side was supposed to 
come here, but what happened with the war and with WWII 
always somethin happenin and he couldn't make it -- they bought 
71 
his passage and everything -- but my father carne here in 1930 
from Yugoslavia and he went back -- his name was Davida, and my 
mother's name was Marija -- and she was a Marovich 
TT: Is there migration from other parts of Yugoslavia 
besides the Dalmatian Coast 
DC: The Dalmatian Coast has given us the biggest amount of •
i 
people but you have people from Slovenia and also to the north 
Serbia, but Louisiana Oyster industry, 95 percent Dalmatian - 
c 
and just in recent times some of them have come from other parts 
of Yugoslavia, on account of recen t s tr ife -- some are in the 
Northern part of the US, and they came down here and the 
Yugoslav people doin well and merged into the group. They're 
kinda clannish. Like in anything else 
MH: Do they keep pictures over there of Plaquemines Parish? 
DC: Well,'we lost our home in Betsy and Camille., and all our 
pictures of children were lost, and fhe only pictures we ever had 
were the ones that were in Yugoslavia, and when my mother went%-4=. 
back in---- well, I :vent in 67, I wags the` first one, Betsy had hit 
3 
LFP„•1MH001,; 
in 65 : and I brought a bunch a  
' 
pictures back and we had made ;~ 
duplicates of them, but•when I was a kid xr Yugoslavia in 1967•I 
seen 'pictures of Plaquemines Parish in the early 1900s, you know, 
of a wedding in Olga, which Olga doesn't even exist anymoi^e, 
there's a shell of a couple of buildings left and a couple of 
fishermen 's camps and at one time they had ,800 Yugoslays livin at 
Olga. And this is where the people from Igrane mostly settled, in 
Olga , and this whole area had a bunch of people, and I seen a 
picture where everybody had the big handlebar mustaches and the 
wide brim hats and they were all stocky strong peop,le,11and I seen 
those pictures when I was over there. 
MH: You were born here?' 
DC: Yeah 
\ 
)  
V 
MH: What kind of an image do they have'of Plaquemines? 
DC: Well, okay, it's Just like Duba. Duba's on the Peljesac 
Peninsula -- see where the point of these two mountains, they go 
down? Well that valley's Duba. And Duba's smaller than Igrane, 
and every man in Duba's been in Plaquemines Parish. It's a little 
small town, and most of the time there's more residents from Duba 
in Empire than there are in Dub a . And it 's amazing -- it's just 
like the Yugoslav people that are here are more or less like -
we've helped a lot of people back and forth, and we see all kind 
of stuff that was sent over there -- motors, paints -- kids in 
these little towns were all wearin lees and levis and nobody else 
had ern over there but we used to send all kinda stuff -- and 
Plaquemines Parish was the benefactor to that whole coast, but 
You take 
MH: Did Louisiana seem exotic to people over there? 
DC: Oh yeah, you take my mother's sister, the first thing 
was the mosquitos had bit her right here, and all of a sudden her 
cheeks had swole up, the first time a mosquito had bit her -- and 
she said she always would remember that when people carne over.the 
first thing they got was the mosquitos, but it's different, it's 
hard to leave your homeland. I always remember my daddy, he left 
Yugoslavia in 1922. He was 11 years old, and he was in New 
Zealand 9 years before he carne to America, and that was hard -
to leave your family and everything else, but that's the way it 
was, back then. And the people -- like my uncle is building a 
house in the old country right now -- he's a graduate engineer, a 
structural engineer, he makes 150 dollars a month. 
The economy 
of that system is so suppressive -- there's no incentive, whether 
you're the best worker or the worst worker, you're still all on 
the same scale. There's no incentives, and that's one thing that 
more or less drove a lot of people out of Yugoslavia. Long before 
the Communists, economic conditions were just terrible. 
MH: Are people free to come and go? 
DC: Well I've been over there four times and I never had any 
trouble, the only time, I seen where they had this one man from 
this,town wha was in a little store, and he started braggin about 
how good it was in America, and he was complainin about politic; 
s. 
over there, and he was a little bit of a political activist and 
he said a little bit too much in the store, you know, Just about 
stuff in America, and he didn't really pinpoint on anything 
against Yugoslavia, but'he just said a little too much and they'; Z 
,wouhd up takin him to aFcamp, and it was like a prison, and he '. 
had to. stay in- there Six weeks, and he had to  poy through an 
ideological type deal , and they forced some stuff on hirrl`wHerm , 
one': ,weekend a month he had to go to this camp , and he killed 
'himself. They wouldn 't do that to an outsider, a foreigner, but 
he•might of had a record. 
There 's a free exchange, but now this country has closed its 
doors more or less. You can come over here on a tourist visa, and 
it's really hard to get a work permit , especially since this 
country's taken in so many Haitians and Vietnamese, and all that 
kinda stopped -- it's super hard to bring somebody over here 
right now to stay. 
I've got a cousin -- he's helpin a friend of 
mine out down the river -- he's not supposed to be workin, but 
he's helpin -- and he 's a really good guy to stay over here -
he's got a lot of incentive in him and he works hard and all, but 
it's almost impossible to get him a green card. 
A lot of these Yugoslays come over here on a grandfather-
type clause , where if you had an in- line ancestor that was a 
citizen of this country, and say, 
if I was a Yugoslav and my 
grandfather was a citizen here, I could come in on his 
citizenship and come in and get my green card to stay here, and 
ultimately work for my citizenship -- or if I, 
my mother, she's a 
citizen, she married my father and became a citizen , now her 
brother, if he wanted to stay here , he would have to apply 
through my mother , you see. 
Yugoslays are not limited here -- there are big colonies in 
Buffalo, New York, and in Pittsburgh -- steel mines, coal mines, 
foundries -- that's the Yugoslays from a little bit farther 
inland. It's the northern part of Dalmatia. Carl Malden the actor 
he's from Yugoslavia, Peter Bogdanovich 's people, father was from 
Yugoslavia , and there 's a Cvitanovich in Hollywood, his father 
was from the same place, they do work for MGM, and every now and 
then their name comes up in the credits. And Delmonte, the 
vegetables , that's a Slavich , they 're from Duba , you know, on the 
Peljesac Peninsula , and you have, from all parts of life. 
There's a lot of Yugoslays in Alaska. All San Pedro, San Diego, 
that's all Yugoslay. Up in Minnesota there's a lot of Yugoslays. 
And there 's an old colony in Biloxi. There 's no new people come 
in there anymore -- it's Just a new generation. And on the coast, 
in Galveston, you had some older colonies, years back. But we're 
spread out all over. 
(Refering to a picture on the wall) _ 
This church. is on top of the town, and around 1915 - 1918, 
around the end of WWI , this fellow became very prominent here - 
his name is Moto Paru_n, and he was a merchant ,.,down at Olga, - 
which is on the east side of the Mississippi near Burgs. There 
was a big thriving Yugoslav community up until 1915 -- the 1915 
hurricane -- but it
., dwindled out until hurricane Camille -- the 
last people moveil out after 1969 -- the-Camille storm. He was a 
merchant. In the old times the river boats used to ply (?)'
the 
river, and they would bring, the fishermen would bring the 
oysters to the frort.and they had the se bi g sheds and you'd sell 
your oysters to a broker -- and a broker would make arrangements 
with dealers in hFjew Orleans, and he would have the riverboat come 
up. Well, when they.. came to the river, when they came back down, `i 
the riverboat would bring all the Stores that they had and he was 
.f 
he fellow that wheeled and dealed and did all this stuff, and he 
mightxeven,,file the A ncome tax, I don't know. Well, he didn't 
have -any ' children, Y 
an6 he sent $ 18,000 back then to build a bell 
tower on the side of the church. He had the bells made in'Italy, 
and they were sent over, and on the front part of the bell tower 
they have where it was donated by Mo 
Parun, a native of 
Igrane, but he made his fortune in Olga, Plaquemines Parish, 
Louisiana, U.S.A. ( pause) Real funny, but it's nice, engraved in 
marble. 
(It says it in Yugoslavian) ( In Yugoslavian now he asks 
mother for the name of the church in Igrane) 
it 
The name of the ch urch is church of the Holy Rosary (?) 
somethin to do with the Rosary.' 
Well, this guy, when he died on Esplanade Avenue, he built 
the church and it's got the same name as this church and he left 
his money to the c hurch on Esplanade Street. I don't know the 
name of the church on Esplanade Avenue but it's right near the 
St. Louis number two cemetery. It's toward Bayou St. John. 
That 
big brick church. It's something with the Rosary. It's a Catholic 
Church and he left his money to it. They named the church the 
same name as this church. 
(It doesn't have a tower) 
TT: Do Yugoslays that are born here maintain the language? 
DC: I'm one of the fortunate ones. We speak Yugoslav, but 
when Yugoslays married non- Yugoslays they kinda last the 
language. But there's a young girl was a Yugoslav, and she 
married a Yugosla v fellow, and she didn't know a word of 
Yugoslav, and I admire her, she speaks Yugoslav just as good as I 
do, and the kids all speak it. 
(showing us pictures, on page 95 of Vuj-novich's book, of 
pioneers of the Orange industry) 
1925 -- and they're all from the little towns I was tell 
you about -- Igrane and Podgora. John Lulich, Anton Lulich, and 
Peter Cvitanovich etc. ( more discussion of people in book) 
This is my father's sister, 
it's my godmother, she was the 
first orange queen in Plaquemines Parish, 1947. 
And this is my 
father's other sister, she was a pioneer of making orange wine. 
(Her husband died when her son was six days old and that's why 
David's father came back (?) over -- to help her. His aunt 
started making orange wine in 1933. 
She lost 8,000 trees to 
Hurricane Betsy.) 
When mama carne here she worked in orchards 
my aunt. There was miles of orchards. The blassorns you could 
smell em for miles. 
The trip was really nice to go down there 
when I was like in second grade, and the freezes hit ( in the 
sixties) and after that it Just diminished.

We prepare to leave for our tour of PlAquemines Parish. 
IN THE CAR ( a Riviera) 
DC: ( re: poor quality of cars in Yugoslavia -- we are about 
to get gas) 
My poor mama massacres my messages . She was nine 
years old when WWII started, and so she didn't get much education 
at all, and so when she came over here in 1953, never did really 
go to school. 
She got her hard accent, so any time she gets a 
message -- if someone named Budro would call me, she would write 
down B-U-D- R-O -- and that was it. 
And everything -- in European 
type languages there's no W -- everything is V, they don't say 
"wine" they say "vine" -- that made me get my answering machine. 
(when he gets out of the car, MH turns down the radio) 
DC: Where are you from? 
MH : I live  in Washington, D.C., but I grew up in Western 
Pennsylvania. 
DC: The hurricanes and the coming of the oil companies 
changed this Coromunity drastically. 
Be ll e 'C hasse was nothing \ 
fifteen years.el le Chasse had about 5,000 people . And with the 
storms there's 9 continual exit out o f here, that we lost two 
good homes in ' 65 and ' 69 and business changed, everything's 
changed down here. What killed the citrus industry was first 
thing the elements, th e weath er, the storms, and labor got so 
high down here -- everyone had a job with the oil companies, the 
sulphur company, your farmer had to compete with big industry for 
labor. 
That put a cap on it. 
Competition for resources among locals? 
Not really. 
Where did everyone move to? 
The city, New Orleans, etc. 
Belle Chasse has more people from the lower end°of the 
parish than people who were born in B.C. 
It's conveniently 
located in betwee. 
He has to give 9'speech March 4 on Yugoslays far the local— 
historical societty'. He worked with N Tonal Geographic for an 
arti3le that 'appeared in August o 
The- United Slovenian Benevolent 
Soc 
ety -- We had a big 
"banquet commemorating the 100 year anniversary the year that:` 
Vujnovi'ch' s book came out -- in 1974. " Big Yugoslay.culture-type 
deal." 
That association was formed for widows and orphans, a 
brotherhood society,.--` help people who are sick. " They built 
tombs in various cemeteries, that way if someone didn't have 
w 
LFPAMH001 
anythiri§ when he passed away the society would take care of him. 
=' 
A social organization. 
Others: The Slovonian Pleasure 
_association, the Yugoslav American club -- the Youngest-of the 
associations -- more youth involvement. 
You've got so much talent -- like my mother and sister are 
super-talented with the needle point, and they do the stuff like 
they do in Europe. 
There are others too. They display things at the Orange 
Festival -- or displays in the French Quarter. 
"It's not as big a deal as the Greeks or the Italians, or= 
Cajuns, but it's sad, 
in that you have a lot of jealousy and 
fighting in the Yugoslavian community." 
Woodcarving? 
No -- Yugoslays are just used to hard work. 
How about play? 
You have this bocce ball -- you know, 
like these Italians 
do? Well in Empire these fishermen get together and they make a 
court -- and what they'll do, they'll each put up a couple 
dollars, and they'll barbecue a pig and have their little 
tournament, and they used to do that every Sunday afternoon when 
they weren't fishing oysters. 
With this weather colder they're 
probably not doin' 
it, 
but -- it's quite often -- And you have 
card - playing, you know, a lot of these European-type games that 
are not played in this country, and they get together and it's 
funny to watch ' em play -- you know, they'll barbecue -- barbecue 
fish and pig and lamb and -- they enjoy themselves. 
We have a big Yugoslav 
C 
9 
picnic in Fort Jackson -- 4 or .., 
hundred people come and barbecue the pigs and all and they have 
the bocce ball games, and the young Yugoslays will play soccer 
and they play -- we call this game " brishcula ( sp?)" it's a card 
game, and you have to  use th e It al ian deck of cards =- I think 
there's 42 cards in a deck, but once you get into the game -- I 
don't know how to play it good, because I lose every time. 
All Yugoslays are singers -- a lot of these more or less 
folk songs -- they all sing. ( People write new songs in 
Yugoslavian) You have such an influx of back and forth -- I've 
been there four times and I'm 30 years old. I may go this summer. 
You have relatives back and forth. 
What's influenced the culture over there from over here? 
The dollar. 
It was funny. When this little town Duba --
every place has a little bit different personality, and I hate to-
say it, 
but Duba's a very peculiar town. 
When they would be 
leavin' to go to America, they would put their suitcase in the 
car at night time, and so if somebody asks " Where you gain?" Say, 
"We're gonna split for Dubrovnik" They wouldn't" ` say, " We're going 
to America." Very very secretive type people. 
No one knows 
what's really gain on: But it was so funny. The first time I went 
W
.
 a they were just getting televisions in the rest of 
Yugoslavia, and every house in Duba had a color tv. 
It was all 
RCA and General Electric tvs that they brought from here. 
It's 
things like that that contribute to the culture. 
They have 10 to 12 hours of programming a day. 
In Europe, not just in Yugoslavia, .but Europe continually-- 
relives WWII constantly. Every town you go to there's going to,be 
a monument to a local hero. They' 11 have like a fourth of July"" 
xLFPAMH001 
celebration for when say"john Jones was killed, and commemorate: 
his life. It's so much alive. Th e y don 't wanner ta ke  that outa`:ih4 
peoples mind. They wanner live in constant fear that it happened } 
and hope that it'll never happen again. Which is good -- 
people are kinda gettin lazy, 
it's kind of a spark to stay 
unified. But like on tv you'll always have some kind of 
commemoration of some hero and all that -- a lot of American 
movies ( with Yugoslavian subtitles) 
The problem right now, with Croatian, Yugoslavian, you've 
got a rift in Yugoslavia right now, whereas the hervots (?) 
that's Croatians -- are deeply in their heart -- they're trying 
to secede Croatia, Dalmatia, from Yugoslavia. There's a big 
internal strife over there right now -- Dalmatia is the 
breadbasket of Yugoslavia. Dalmatia is the fishing industry, the 
ports, the tourism, everything is Dalmatia. 
Seventy percent of the national income is out of Dalmatia, 
fifteen percent of the country, but the richest part. There's a 
cold war, a civil war going on. 
Certain places are extremely Croat, which, to me it doesn't 
make a difference, but so what happened -- there's this place in 
the French Market called the Central Grocery, and it's an ethnic-
type business -- they sell olive oil, all kind of things from 
your Mediterranean region, and they had a flag of Yugoslavia, 
Italy, Spain, and Greece, and this one Yugoslav guy comes in 
there and explodes on the owner -- he says " Man -- do you know 
that -- in Chicago -- if you would have that flag in your place, 
they would come and bomb your place." And so you've got a lot of 
crazy people -- it's the Yugoslavian flag, and the French are 
proud of their flag, every country in the world is proud of their 
flag, 
but these people are against the Yugoslav flag in that it 
unites the seven republics together into one. They want their own 
flag. 
The Yugoslav flag is the same as the French flag except that 
it has the red star in the middle of it, 
and you know, the red 
star is Communist. Well, thing is, 
what they don't take into 
consideration is that the red is the red blood that poured for 
that flag. Yugoslavia is a small country, only Gc million people 
and 6 million people died in WWII, so that's 
The people down the street from me -- we have a Yugoslav 
bar, and his wife -- he must be 45 years old -- two of his kids 
were born in Yugoslavia and the youngest was born here, but his 
father was executed -- He was ma ybe two months old when his 
father was executed and he was one of em that was against the 
flag. " Goddam it," he said, " My father's blood was on that flag." 
They take it overboard. America's my ,country and I'm born and 
raised under the fifty stars and I hope to die here. I believe in 
what it stands for and if I have to fight for it I'll fight for 
it. 
You know, th e y want to make a big big issue about it, 
and 
it's startin to flare up here, and I really don't like the 
direction it's Lakin. 
Where do people perform the music here? 
Last year you had three different performances.-- Yugoslav 
performers were here -- a group from Zada, Dubrovnik, and a big 
Yugoslav singer -- and they performed., in Empire at the Empire `
1-: 
Citizen Building. They were on tour in the United States.4at the 
t 
ime. 
What about local performers? 
No. 
What type of music do people generally listen to? 
You've got your rock, your basics. But over there there's 
alot more -- like, look at the Greek (?) -- how the old men all 
sang and danced, you have a lot of that in Yugoslavia, and you 
have that here, where a group of people when they get a bottle of 
wine -- it gets all kinda music out of it.I'Like my cousin, he's 
on the tug in Venice right now, and he's a beautiful singer -
this guy -- they get four or five of em together, you know they 
huddle up and they start singing really beautiful songs. Old 
songs. I remember as kids we learned old songs. We know a few of 
em in a group. 
If I'd a been born over there I'd of picked up 
mare."' Everything is a festi ve type. 
____4
Have you taped it? 
Oh yeah. No one did it commercially. 
(They don't have any kind of an archive) 
The Yugoslavian culture is really lacking in that respect. 
Mr. Vu,jnovich tried to do something with it and all, 
but the 
Yugoslav people get hung up into workin, makin money and it's 
history down here that if the Yugoslav people would have ever 
banded together, the Yugoslav people would have been king here. 
There wouldn't have been room for Perez, that's how strong 
Yugoslav people are. They're clannish, and there's a lot of 
,jealousy -- but that's life. 
Is there an oysterman's association? 
There's two of em -- one's a Louisiana Oyster Dealer and 
Growers association -- I'm on the board of directors of that, and 
the Plaquemines Oyster association, and Ilia not involved with 
that one because they have some radical elements in that. 
Are they all Yugoslavians? 
In the Plaquemines association 90 percent are Yugoslavian, .• 
seventy percent in the LODAG. 
The other ten percent are Cajun 
Shucking houses? 
Yes 
Who works in them? 
Half-breeds -- you know, Mulattoes and Vietnamese. The 
Vietnamese are takin over the fishing industry. They are a really 
effective work force. They're not wasteful, and it kinda brings a 
lot of jealousy from the American people, but you got to admire 
where they come from and where they're going to. They pool their 
money, they're very resourceful, they're not wasteful. 
You have four -or five different Vietnamese"coloni'es in the 
New Orleans area -- Ypu don't have any Vietnamese living in 
Plaquemines '-- very.few, but New Orleans east is the bi gg est 
concentration, and al so r ight near my house, right before you get 
on that New Woodland Road bridge, there's a Vietnamese colony *' 
right there. That's your two biggest. 
How about shrimping? 
Well, Yugoslav fishermen use shrimping as a side- line. Your . 
shrimp industry-.here -- Yugoslays got more into the marketing of 
shrimp. Tom Cvitanovich, which is a cousin of mine, he's involved: 
with big freezers -- he's got thirteen, eighteen wheelers gon 
LFFAMH001 
across the United States,`a multi-million -dollar outfit, but the 
Yugoslay.people aren't any big force in the shrimp industry. In 
V S ail- Yugoslays, but it's all second genera ti on now . 
What's the seasonal round? 
Oyster industry is your main line. + The Oyster . season starts 
the first Wednesday'after labor day. Oystei^ season -- this year 
is a bad season, 
in that it's scarce, you had two storms that 
really did us a lot of damage -- hurricane Juan and Hurricane 
Danny, and Hurricane Elena also -- and we had a very poor catch 
this past year. There's a lot of people in the oyster industry 
that were never in the oyster industry before because the oyster 
industry is still inviting -- still a profitable enterprise to 
look into. But what happened is the river was low last year, and 
we have a lot of snails, predators that thrive on oysters --
(the oyster borer) 
and people are losin thousands of sacks of oysters every day 
right now with the borer -- they had to go onto their own leases 
M -- and usually the oyster season stays open an average of 
eight months a year through April -- but they may have to close 
it earlier. It's regulated by the wildlife and fisheries 
commission -- after the first of the year they can choose whether 
to extend the season through May the fifteenth or go ahead and 
close it with the supply and demand type deal. This year it looks 
like they're gonna close. 
Your shrimp season, shrimp industry is good from May through 
October. This year probably everybody'll be shrimpin. But now, 
this was on the state reefs -- the state beds -- for oysters, but 
on your own private beds they're open 12 months of the year. But 
we've been Navin more and more problems with pollution, where 
they close it for periodic closure, whether for two months or ten 
months, and they regulate it on the flow of the water and 
different other factors. 
What's causing the pollution? 
Oh, a thousand and one things. You see this big cattle farm 
that we just passed here? Okay, you've got a lot of oyster 
fishermen 
that filed suit against this cattle farm. They claim 
(end of tape) He went on to say that cow manure was polluting the 
water. The ranch is operated by Italians.

TEXT: ( continued from AMH001) 
Who raises the cattle here? _ 
DC: The Italians. The richest man in Italy owns this -- he 
was Faruzzi, and they own 17 or 18 miles of riverfront and they 
have a big extensive cattle investment here. 
r-
They don't do any fishing. 
This is company from Italy that owns this property here. But 
you have Italians on the east side of the river, which, they are 
historically known as truck farmers, at least second and third 
generation. 
He doesn't know what part of Italy they are from. 
Yugoslays tried trapping, they tried farming, and they were 
good at anything they did, but the oyster industry was their 
thing. They Just loved the oyster industry. 
Do you use different boats for oystering and shrimping? 
No, You just adapt them. 
They're adaptable. 
We're passing old oak trees. 
DC is a guide for the oil companies. 
I do a little bit of everything. We own numerous leases. We 
had boats, but I got out of the boat end of it because the 
insurance was so high and we weren't on the boats ourselves, and 
to find crews was getting harder and harder. More profitable 
subbing oyster leases out to different people. Also I do this 
guiding with the oil companies. 
A 
Was supposed to do it for 3 months in 1973-` and i`b just 
blossomed, with the Arab boycott, 
it really picked up. 
I was a nosy kid', 
and when I was a little boy I used to be 
in the bayous all the time. That's my sixth sense. I'could draw 
you a map of anywhere. I got a photographic memory. And whenever` 
I see a little canal or somethin, 
I'd wanna see where the canal 
was gain. I never travelled the same place twice. Other kids 
wanted to fish, fool around, but I Just wanted to ride, see whait 
I could see. I watched the fishermen, where they had good reefs 
at. and all, and I learned a lot --
There are alligators. 
LFPAMH002 
At one 
in Venice, before the season, nobody had dogs, 
because alligators ate all the dogs. 
It was rough down here. 
They still have the alligator nuisance patrol, but .it was aE 
gravy job, and it's not as lucrative as what it was. Matter of 
fact, where we were-abetting gas, a young fellow that drove up in 
the truck, he's got that commission, he's one of the alligator 
nuisance hunters. He's got the warrant to do that. 
What did you think of the movie " The Ends of the Earth" 
It was good, 
but I'll tell you, 
it wasn't say biased, but 
the way it showed Plaquemines Parish, it's just a little black 
place, nothin but blacks. Sure, fine, the blacks were kind of 
walked on with Perez, with the segregation issue and everything 
else, and with Eddie Phillips, matter of fact, Eddie Phillips, 
the first black man on the school board lives up here, this is 
his district, 
this is Diamond -- it shows where he won the 
election, and they had the celebration at his house -- that was 
right here. Well, Eddie's a nice guy and I'm glad for Eddie, but-
it doesn't show Plaquemines Parish as a progressive parish. 
It 
doesn't show the oil industry. 
It doesn't show the people in 
business and what.they did and all that stuff -- it just shows 
Plaquemines Parish as a little strip of land, with a few black 
people over here and Perez suppressed them. That's -- I think 
Andrew and them coulda done a little better on that -- --
Remember in that movie, the little settlement on the bayou, 
where Eddie Phillips was goin' to visit these people and they 
lived -- remember the school boat? Well that's back here. Right 
now, see they're gonna have a road to the settlement -- see the 
houses? That's Grand Bayou settlement -- they have a little 
school out there, a little school boat comes everyday. What they 
did, they dredged out the canal -- and once the mud settles down 
they can build a road all the way to the settlement. 
(It's a creole settlement. All fishermen. They trap, but 
mostly fish, shrimp and oysters. About a hundred and fifty 
people. Each family has a couple of boats. 
It's their sole means 
of transportation. Doug Lee of National Geographic wrote a story 
on Grand Bayou) 
There's a fellow named Clyde Lockwood -- Ceecee ( sp.?) 
Lockwood -- he photographs nature photographs -- " But he 
couldn't quite capture people in his pictures, so what happened 
was this guy from N.C. by the name of Steve Walsh ( or Walt) had 
to come back and reshoot. D. C. 
was his guide. S. W. 
tagged along 
with D.C. -- going to the oysterplants, the shrimpboats, 
different other things. They got the school boat into the story. 
We're driving through Port Sulphur. 
This was originally all oranges, and in 19 8 -29 the 
Freeport (?) Shreveport (?) Sulphur Company drilled the first 
Sulphur Wells -- at . Lake Washington, ten miles south. of here -- I 
hail uncles, ray mother's father's brothers were oysterfishermen, 
and they had their own freight boat where they would carry their 
oysters to New Orleans where they would pick up stuff, supplies. 
for the other people and bring ern to the different settlements on 
the river. Well they went to work for Freeport carrying men, and 
supplies and they held seven hundred men*.on that boat, 
it was a 
paddlewheel, and they wound up buildin tugs and worked for 
Freeport for about 35 years. And they got out of the business-
2n, 
fiY 
LFPAMH002 
1960, but this was nothin but a big sulphur plantation. They're 
the ones that „ developed":.t_his place -- this part of Port Sulphur's 
called.Pot Ash -- a product of Sulphur, and this place really 
thrived with the Freeport Sulphur Company. The first bank'-in 
Plaquemines Parish was built in Port Sulphur. 
It was a really 
thriving community. Then in the late '60s, Sulphur was found a 
lot cheaper in Indonesia, Canada, and Australia, and this place 
started dyin, and it went down drastically.. The sulphur plant 
here doesn't employ ten percent of the people that it employed 
twenty years ago. 
(There's a high unemployment rate, but it isn't as high as 
Louisiana's average is) " You always had the shrimp, you always 
had the oysters, and 
you always had the oil industry. That way 
there was a lot of other relief valves. Everything helped out, 
but it's been hard down here the last two years. Really been 
tough. 
The P. 
S. area had a few big native French families here, 
and once the sulphur companies came they developed these 
subdivisions on upper side of P. 
S. 
and there's a alot of these 
people from Church Point, Abbeyville area, cajun people -- the 
Broussards ( sp.?), Guidres (?), Guiileries ( sp.?) they carne here 
and they were roustabouts for the sulphur companies, and they 
lived here and port sulphur was a pretty big town. 
Business is almost dead here -- there's nothin at all. At 
one time it was a thrivin community. See this is the ship dock 
here, P. 
S. 
There's the state marker: 
HUB OF THE LOUISIANA SULPHUR INDUSTRY, BUILT IN 1932-33 
BY FREEPORT SULPHUR COMPANY TO LOGISTICALLY (?) SUPPORT 
GRAND ACAILLE (? means " Big Tarpin" in French) WORLD'S 
SECOND LARGEST FRASH ( frash sulphur mine -- a process 
where they would ' super heat' water and pump it down into 
the earth and with the superheated water the sulphur would 
come up) 
At one time there was hundreds of houses here, but they 
moved them all out when the sulphur, companies folded -- See at 
one time this was nothin but sulphur -- they would always have 
two or three ships waiting to load sulphur. That ship's been tied 
up for four years. 
It hasn't gone nowheres. They get a ship once 
every fifteen, twenty days now. See how big that building is? 
That was once full of people, and now they handle everything from 
that little office right there. 
(Willow trees line the levees) 
Empire is the center of Yugoslavian culture in Plaquemines 
Parish. You start to see Yugoslavian influence when you get down 
there in the names -- local businesses are all"*Yugoslav names. 
Religion? St. Anne's is a little catholic bhurch with mostly 
Yugoslavian s in the'eongregation. D.C. says you can tell a lot 
from the cemeteries. There are a lot of french names in them 
Buras, Collette, Balle ( Ballet?), and the Yugoslays came in 
.afterwards. " The local deltans are jealous of the Yugoslays cause 
the Yugoslays got all the biggest and best homes down here." 
(Deltans = " local Delta natives" -- their terra for 
Yugoslays is " tacos" -- " This is just an old wives tale, but you 
remember that picture- of the Yugoslav tug-of-war team? ( in': 
Vujnovich) Well, " taco" means ' do it like that' -- this is 
3 
hearsay #.`but the story must be good, because it's been out.,almos 
a hundred years -- they had.>the tug-of-war championship, and 
Yugoshavi share a border with Italy, and Yugoslays have been" 
war- with Italy for hundreds of years, back and forth from- the 
---time-of the-
Venetians, the Turks, there always have been the 
border squabbles, the resentment, like now Trieste is in Italy, 
where before Trieste was in Yugoslavia, you know, I'm talkin 
about in the Austria-Hungary times -- It's tough, so we had a 
tug-of-war championship and it was the Italians against the 
Yugoslays, at that time -- which were the Austrians -- Yugoslavia 
was part of Austria-Hungary, the Hapsburg empire -- well, they 
had the Yugoslays were poor fishermen, they were all in bluejeans 
and dungarees, and the Italians were braggadocious, they were all 
in tuxedos, okay? And on each team they had an anchorman, and the 
anchorman had the rope tied around ' im, and what happened was, 
when the Italians tied the rope, they tied a slip knot around 
this guy, and by puttin a slip knot -- the Yugoslays were far 
stronger than what the Italians were -- they put a slip knot, and 
the guy started squeezin, and the Yugoslays were pullin, and they 
had resentment, like a local rivalry, and what happened, with the 
tight rope, he started bleeding -- and they seen the blood comin 
out of him and they started saying " Taco! Taco!" like that and 
ever since that, that's why they call them Tacos." 
The Italian fellow died. Poor stupid Italian didn't 
to tie a good knot. Excuse me, 
but... 
All these houses here, these are all Yugoslays. All 
Yugoslavian oysterfishermen. The new big house, evidently he 
musta had a housewarming party or something. 
See these brick houses here? Those are two Slavich brothers 
from Duba, okay? Those are Iva Pulpich -- these are brick houses, 
nice houses. See now this one's got a little bit of Yugoslav 
architecture, you see, with the stone on the front here? Okay, 
that's Luca Siblich, he's from Duba. Remember the little town I 
showed you? Just a little bitty place? He's from Duba. He's 
young, maybe thirty four years old, he married a girl -- her 
mother and father were from Yugoslavia, and they're big in the 
oyster industry. Gettin a little bit further over here --( these 
are local people -- natives here, own a supermarket chain down 
here) -- this big house here was our neighbor in Yugoslavia John 
Valiancich -- he built that house by himself. 
It looks like a 
Swiss type house. This is second generation Yugoslavia. But now, 
see these two houses here, these are all Yugoslav 
oysterfishermen. So, - you know, Yugoslav fishermen they're all 
successful. 
Are there any Yugoslavian recipes for oysters? 
Well, Yugoslays like to put a lot of olive oil and lemon --
everything they'cook -has to have olive oil and lemon in it. Now 
this is Yugoslays here -- he's an in surance man, he's third 
generation, and then the guy next to him he's a first-generationo,`" 
(We pass a cemetery with big square cc.,ncrete-block tombs) 
You know what that's for don't you? The caskets all float 
out of the ground down here -- they're airtight, and what happens 
-- see this land here is like soup -- ( there's a little black 
cemetery we crust.-passed) -- but everyone here.-- for hurrican 
42-,. 
know how 
LFPAMHOO2 
Camille, a hundred and' seventy caskets come outa the ground.- from 
the storm, because thin'was all covered with water, and the 
caskets are airtight and they were all poppin outa the ground - 
How can anybody be sure they get them back in the right 
plot? -' 
See, they stamp all the caskets with a certain number, and 
they keep a log of what casket goes where. See that's a 
Yugoslavian oyster fisherman. And now a group of Yugoslavian 
oysterfishermen bought this whole property, there's a little 
motel on there -- they bought this whole stretch. 
MH: This seems like a precarious place to live. 
D.C.: What do you mean by precarious? 
MH: The storms, the land disappearing 
DC: Well, there is nothing guaranteed in life. Down here you 
had to be hard to survive. You had to have a will to survive. 
And, gettin back to the Yugoslays , Yugoslavia was more or less 
the battle ground of Europe, with Attila the Hun and everything 
else, and you had to be tough to survive , and Yugoslays were 
tough to survive. Oyster industry's a very tough industry. 
It's 
only been super lucrative in the last ten, fifteen years, but it 
was a very bad business, people lost -- but they had persistence, 
they came back and they built it up again. You take Hurricane 
Camille, 
it ultimately killed my father -- here my father was, he 
was fifty-eight years old when the storm hit, he paid his last 
house note two weeks before the storm, he had a little bar room, 
he had eight or ten little rent houses -- he had a couple 
boats workin for the oil company -- sittin on top of the world, 
and two weeks later he had one boat left working for the oil 
company. He lost everything he ever owned, he didn't hardly save 
anything because he paid everything off, and insurance companies 
only pay 25 percent. So, the big strain on him, he wound up 
dying, he got diabetes, they had to amputate his leg, and he 
lived about eight months after. But things were hard. '-
Okay, this is Empire. This is your base of the Louisiana oil 
industry. This is the hub of the industry. This is -- there's 
some crazy guys -- one of em got " Croatia" written on the side of 
his car -- one foot letters, you know -- a political activist" --
this is Miljack's ( sp?) Hotel and bar -- that's a yugoslav name 
-- it's an american restaurant, but it's second generation people 
that own it -- this is the St. Ann Church -- this 
s all 
Yugoslays -- Jurisich, Popich, they a ll li ve here .• This here's 
the basin at Empire -- you have a shipyard, you have all the 
oyster unloading docks, the hub of the industry's here -- the 
tractor trailers come from throughout the country -- these are 
your typical oyster boat, with your dredges ori, the bow, and the 
cabins on the stern, and they just work in a circular motion --
see that 's all Yugoslav boats. 
Mostly wooden -- these new ones -- like this one here, Big 
Joe, that's all aluminum -- you've got about 15 - 20 aluminum 
boats here, several steel boats, and several fiberglass boats, 
but you have these Yugoslav names -- Captain Kuzma, Lady Maria 
(5p.?) -- Maria's my mother's name -- Lepotich brothers -- Tino, 
that's all Yugoslav names --
(They improve them all the time. One of the boats he pointed 
to was worth $250,000, he said) 
I --
Defining features of the oyster boats 
First thing you've- got ,a' high bow, compared to the;.sterin' 
your high bow to fight the weather -- you see these wate-t guns on 
the front -- the Yugoslays innovated that -- with puttin fire 
guns, they don't shovel on the boats no more -- when a dredge 
comes up on the deck 
they blow the oysters back with these high-
pressure water guns, and, see how they got these aluminum flaps 
on the side? they just raise the flaps and,that's how they plant 
their oysters. And that's an improvement that just happened in 
the last ten years or so. And every year they're doing more and 
more -- like when this boat came out, these other boats have 
these masts, where this boat built this A- frame, there's .an 
engineer in this guy's family, and they bui lt another boat with 
it, and now they come out with these A- frames and now every year 
with a little bit more and more -- 
The Yugoslav names are all symbolic. The "- ich" -- D.D. 
Popich, K. 
J. 
Tesich, -- this boat was built by his sons, he got 
killed years back, his car went over a bridge at Port Sulphur, 
and D and D Popich, that's named after Drago and Dinko Popich, 
they were brothers in a business --
Would anybody name a boat after themselves? 
Oh yeah, - like this guy here -- " Dinko" is named after 
himself -- but there's the Slavich brothers, Captain Baldo --
Haldo's a popular Yugoslav name -- but

TT: Are there any Yugoslavian boatbuilders down here? 
>' DC: No, not rea 11 y. 
TT: They contract it out? 
DC: Right, b6-f Phillips 66 chartered this boat to make a 
commercial this past year. 
It was seen on nationwide television a 
couple weeks ago, on the Monday night football game, and this K. 
J. Tesvich was on the commercial, they had.a actor runnin the 
boat and everything, talkin about how Phillips is good for the 
environment and everything --
That's the high rise bridge -- we'll cross that after I 
finish tellin you about the boats. 
TT: It seems like the characteristics of the oyster boats 
include this awning over the top of it 
DC: To keep the oysters cool in the sun, because the sun is 
detrimental to them.•No you see on that boat Tino? You see how 
they got the black stripe on there? You know what that means? It 
means the owner of that boat got killed. He was a young guy, he 
was twenty three years old and he went into the old country one 
year for the summer, 
it was 1973, so now his brother-in-law owns 
the boat, his sister and her husband, and they always put a black 
stripe in mourning. 
It's an old thing, some people don't believe 
in it no more, but some of these Yugoslays still believe in it, 
but this K. J. 
Tesvich, and that boat, Captain Kuzma, 
they were 
both made by the same guy -- he got killed, he drove off the 
bridge at Fort Sulphur, he and his little boy the day before 
Thanksgiving 25 years ago, you know, 
it's real biq around here to 
Give oysters away for Thanksgivinq,_ and he was coming back from 
giving his friends oysters, and he was coming across the bridge, 
and we don't know if it was h 
i 
s boy, you khow, touched the 
steering wheel or whatever, and he went over the bridge, and now 
it's nothing but slush, and there's no way they could have 
survived and he and his son both drowned, so his wife was 
expecting the boy that built this boat when he died, and the boat 
is named after his father.4 
That boat's a quarter of a million dollars --
but it's only 
two years old. 
Tina -- the boat with the black stripe on it --
his name was Cristomorton (?) -- Tino was his nickname -- his 
brother-in-law put the black stripe on it when he died. 
This here's called Marovich canal -- my uncle of the 
Marovich family -- they're the ones that dug this canal when they 
had boats workin for Freeport sulphur canal -- they had the 
Freeport dredge dig this canal out years back --
Other companies using it include an ice factory, a shipyard, 
a machine shop, various service companies, mai ' »as --
No less than two men work on a boat. Up on the leases they 
may work as high as four or five men when they're workin an 
abundance of oysters. On their own private beds they come in 
almost every night, and you take, on the state beds on the east 
side of the river they stay out overnight. 
(They don't have to keep the oysters wet, but they have to 
keep them shaded. 
Commenting on the use of radar and different kinds of-radios 
on the boats now. •1 
The captain operates the wheel on the front for the wind

LFPAMH002 
and"he'11 raise the dredge, and the man on the back sorts the 
oysters out whenthey come up in the dredge -- culling the 
shells, crabs, mud. The mesh.,-,
basket is used as " a measure" --) 
The K. J. 
draws about a foot and a half of water. The.-bottom 
is flat, and the stern has a tunnel- type where the propellers 
come up into the bottom to minimize the draft. Engines are all KM 
diesels.  The K. J. ' s got a V8 that's 300 horsepower ... 
Are there names for different kinds of oyster shells? 
\`If you have a long thin narrow shell, kinda hard to open, 
that means the oyster's growin fast, it's growin too fast, they 
call that a " coon oyster" here, and your pretty real attractive 
oyster is called a " cockshell oyster" -- the one that you see a 
picture of, the prettiest one -- and then you have a deep cup-
type oyster, they call that a " cup oyster" and it's different 
types of formation, the reef, the salt content, the currents that 
do that. 
How do you navigate out on the water? 
You've got bayous and bays and channels 
What are your different kinds of winds? 
Okay, well, now, the wind's out of the north, when the 
wind's outa the north or northwest the tides are low. That's why 
most of these boats are tied up right now. The first thing the 
weather was real bad last couple of days and now after this bad 
weather you have a low tide, and it's not really worth diggin up 
reefs in low tide -- you do damage to your boat and to your 
reefs. And the winds out of the south in the summertime usually 
bring the tides high. 
But you have a northwest wind comes, 
it 
means your weather's gonna get cold, your tide's gonna go out, 
and usually your tide's -- lookin on these pilin's -- your tide's 
about ten or twenty-four inches out right now. 
TT: Do the women ever go out with the men on the boats? 
DC: Oh yeah. 
TT: Do they provide support service, or 
DC: No, they got some tough women, matter of fact -- about 
two weeks ago I took my uncle into Bayou Cook',two weeks ago, and 
this brat, The Saint Anthony, this guy and his wife were out 
there cullin oysters, workin, you know, she was shovellin oysters 
and everything. Tough people. 
It's not commonplace, but 
TT: When does a father start putting his son to work, 
seriously, on the boat? 
DC: These Tesvich boys, they all started when they were in 
eighth grade in school. 
TT: Is there a problem with the second generation foilowin 
up on the first generation? 
DCc Not really, because I seen where a lat of people, the 
second generation, they're accountants, graduates from college. 
(Shouts to someone in Croatian -- they converse a little) 
DC: That's the'best Yugoslav singer
-right there -- ( the man, 
Mare ( phonetically) Heehar, shouts something back) He says, 
"don't believe that -- a big ugly like he is" ( laughing) He can 
sing almost opera -- 
-(They sing on the boats, at parties) 
No problems,with kids going to college -- sometimes they go, 
-Y_-.-and ; come back and work on the boats. 
Just like the Slavich family, New Orleans. The guy"s got''.two y.:. 
LFPAMH002 
sons. One of em, both of em graduated from 
back on deck of the boats ---
- 
? TesLich -- he went to college about a year and a half, 
smart kid, bright kid, 
but his mother owns a lot of reefs, and 
they had a business all along, and he's into it wholeheartedly 
TT: Is the younger generation getting Americanized? 
DC: Well, first of all, you can't make the money on a 
regular job that you can make on oysters. Now these people, some 
of ern make a hundred thousand dollars a year, bustin ass, excuse 
me. But you've got where the elements are against you. This place 
is washin away, more and more, Plaquemines Parish is not going to 
be on the face of the map, 
in fifty or sixty years, with the 
subsidence, and the constant erosion, encroachment of the sea, 
and I'd hate to say Plaquemines Parish won't be here in 50 years, 
Plaquemines Parish as we know it will be drastically changed, and 
it's not inviting for someone to spend big dollars and stay in 
this business. 
TT: Do the oil industry's canals affect it? 
DC: Everything's doin it -- first thing -- the settlement 
along the river. Okay, you laid levees, and building levees 
stopped the siltation of the river, so you don't have any more 
siltation of the marsh. You have where oil companies did cut 
canals, another thing too, years back you didn't have all the 
boats you have now in these bayous and marshes -- this canal 
here, twenty years ago there was only 25 oyster boats tied up 
here -- now this is home for a hundred and fifty, two hundred 
boats, and there's numerous other harbors -- so fifty years ago 
if they only had 200 boats workin, now there's 3,000 boats 
workin. Back then it was a 
l 
l small boats, and it's  b 
i 
g boats, and 
you know, big equipment gain back and forth, and that all adds up 
to the erosion problem. 
It can't just be pinpointed on to the oil 
industry, it's a host of things -- pollution, and various other 
factors. 
MH: What are the bamboo poles for? 
DC; That's what you 
sound for your reef -- that's how you 
find where the oysters are. 
MH: And they all have different flags on them? 
DC: Well you put the flag on account of when you're dredgin 
against the sun and if you just had the straight pole you can't 
see it, whereas you got a flag you can see it, and they'll use 
the pole without the flag to find a reef --
MH: Do people try to have different flags? 
DC: Oh yeah, there's all kinda stuff -- might be a brassiere 
hangin off some of ern, 
who knows --- all kinda crazy stuff, but 
it's nothin really symbolic -- 
11 
t 
The state grounds are open to everyone. 
You know what's'°good about oystering compared to shrimping, 
the oysters don't swim away, whereas shrimp, when you find 
shrimp, you better get em fast, because they're movin, whereas an' 
oyster, he's stationary -- 
TT: One thing I found goin out with the Isienos snrimpin is 
that there's so many people, like you were sayin earlier, there's 
more people now workin the same waters "- there's an unwritten 
possessiveness to a' certain canal, and what might have been"one 
man's turf twenty years ago, he shares with four people, and 
college and both o 
LFPAMH002 
they',ve got their own set of rules, and the rules are that if 
he's going through the canal
-
and he's hittin hard, the ideal 
thing``•for him to.do is to idle and just let it roll right into 
his nets, but because he's got a boat behind him , the unwritten 
rule is that he is not allowed to idle, he has to keep movin so 
that the boat behind him can have a fair crack at the shrimp too. 
DC: And the sad part is they'll try to hog one another, and 
it's tough. There's nothin fair about this anyrnore. 
MH: What about the hinged flap on the boats? 
DC: These boats -- you see how you got those planks sort o 
slid in? Well, when they're planting oysters they'll load that 
boat all the way up to the windows from the bow to the stern with 
seed oysters, and they get on the reefs, they'll open these flaps 
and and take these water guns and shoot the high pressure 
underneath there, and the oysters'll go overboard. You've got a 
pump -- the pump has probably got a six-inch suction, and is 
discharged through two inch and a quarter nozzles, 
it probably 
can shoot a hundred and fifty foot of stream -- it's very strong. 
TT: It works like a shovel 
DC: You can unload that boat in one hour's time. 
If you had 
to shovel that boat, 
it takes four hours, four men. You're 
eliminating labor, you're eliminating a lotta hard work. 
(We go back to the car) 
DC: I'll show you a couple [ of boats] that are adapted to 
shrimping. 
The oystermen are waking up to litter in the water. " You 
throw a dredge now and they're always pulling up a couple beer 
bottles and cellophane, and you're seeing more of that and a lot 
less oysters. 
It's ... You see this Molly Yozo here, he's got 
that frame on top, he'll put shrimp nets with it in the 
summertime, Molly Yozo means " Little Joe" in Yugoslay. See they 
got a boat across the canal with the stern facing us -- Nedo --
it's got that riggin for shrimping. ( we pass some kids and he 
says they're makin a mess. " It's pitiful." 
People are working on 
a boat. A big Lafitte skiff. 
MH; Most of the boats have male names 
DC: I used to find with these Yugoslays, when they would 
build a boat they would name it after their mother. They wouldn't 
name it after their wives or their daughters, always after their 
mother -- but like -- you see these boats with these bones? 
That's all Vietnamese shrimpin boats --
TT: but they don't live down here, right? 
DC: No, uh-uh, but they stay on the boats quite a bit. When 
they come down they'll stay a week at 
a time on the boats. See 
how this boat, this " Perfection" has got his b•ow? That's' an old 
sailing schooner -- and that boat's probably over a hundred years 
old, and it's still In the oyster trade. 
Most of the wooden boats are built out of cy ress. 
TT: The church is still an important institution in 
Yugoslav society? 
DC: Yes and no. 
It's sad. You know in the old country, 
in 
the Naretha (?) River valley, this place is known as -- every 
body in that town is a card-carrying communist. And there's more 
Catholics in that town than anywhere else over there. So, 
it's_ 
got its place in society over there. 
In the last ten years 
f0

they've built more churches in Yugoslavia, ( Raman Catholic)
:. 
This high-rise bridge was built about eight or nine yearn. 
ago. 
It gives a nice view of the bays and -, bayous and all" 
At one time you may have had 20, 25 shrimp boats that were 
home port of Empire, now you have about 350 Vietnamese shrimp 
boats home port of Empire -- so it's 
We see Bay Adams 
See those sticks in the water? That's how you mark the 
oyster beds. Make little farms, little pens. Each leaseholder 
marks his leases. 
Is there a problem of theft of oysters? 
DC: More and more. 
TT: I was reading about an annual event that took place in 
Bay Adams 
DC: The blessing of the fleet. 
(no races) It's a ceremony -- a bunch of boats'll be all 
decorated and -- you'll have a hundred and fifty boats out in the 
bay, and maybe 2 -3,000 people there, they have bands on the 
boats and the priest blesses them, there's a little procession 
out there, a little mass, and it's nice. 
Before the oyster and the second shrimp season. The first 
shrimp season starts in May, and the second one starts the third 
Monday in August, so what they'll do is the third Sunday in 
August, or the Sunday before the shrimp season starts they'll 
have the beat blessing, and oyster season starts two weeks after 
that, for both of em combined. 
TT: Do the Vietnamese join in the ceremony? 
DC: Oh, 
it's the whole community

TEXT: ( coat. from AMHO02) 
DC: From Empire down there's no such thing as an old house, 
because the storms all blow em away. From the lower side of Buras 
to Venice, you had 5,000 buildings before Hurricane Camille. 
After Camille, they had seven buildings left. Everything was 
destroyed. 
It was like somebody passed there with a big broom. 
And that's what's sad, there's no building of history. 
TT: Is much of the Yugoslav population down in Grand Island 
at all? 
DC: No, not at all. 
You had roughly before the 1915 storm a 
little colony of Yugoslays between Morgan City and Franklin. I 
had an aunt that was born over there, and-she and her sisters, 
Miss Miljak ( sp?) the one that owns the restaurant they had a 
little community of Yugoslays, but they intermarried with the 
French population and kinda moved off and the oyster industry 
over there -- there's only one Yugoslav left -- Kristicevich --
in the oyster business in Morgan City. They don't keep in touch 
or anything. 
TT: Is there much Yugoslav on the other side of the river? 
DC: Well the oyster industry, basically the heart of the 
oyster industry is the other side of the river -- the other side 
of the river, talkin below St. Bernard's , the east side of 
Plaquemines, there's no Yugoslays on that side the river --
blacks and a few native, but seventy percent black over there. 
TT: What is the difference between Dalmation and Yugoslav? 
DC: I like Dalmatian better --- we appreciate it a little 
more. Okay, you got a big boat harbor here at `Buras, but ,lust to 
show you how things have changed, when I was a kid, before 
Hurricane Camille, you had, two canals used,to come all the way 
up- to the river, and that was your center of activity. That was 
the, heart of Buras -- you had the shrimp cannery, the oyster 
cannery, you had, my daddy's barroom was right over here, this 
was the lower bank of the Kazazoo (?) Canal right here -- the 
Faslin (?) Canal was right on the other side of the ball field 
you had fuel docks, you had shrimp, -- you had over a hundred 
boats tied up here, and you had fishermen -- and this was the 
heart of Buras. See where that levee- is right now? They.moved-
rt. 
LrPAMH003 
that levee 'thr•ee hundred feet, since Hurricane Camille. 
And when 
I was a kid the old hotel -- that's one of the old buildings left 
in Buras, Constantine's dress shop -- well, when I was a kid, 
they had the Standard Oil Station, Esso, whatever , here -- my 
daddy's barroom was right here, the front steps are gone -- and 
behind the barroom there was over 300 feet to the river . ( we were 
standing right next to the levee) -- the telephone company was 
here, you had another little hotel here -- they had a bar and 
lounge here -- you had a big grocery store here , you had the 
other canal carne to the highway here, you had a cemetery here 
(this is starting to sound like a litany ), 
you had Phillips 66 
had a station here, they had a Western Arco over here, they had 
another grocery store over here, and you had the power company 
and an ice factory . This was all the heart of Buras, and now 
there's nothin here , because they moved the levee so many times. 
MH: What's that building right there with the hide on it? 
DC: Oh (laughs) that's a fruitcake , I hate to say it --
she's strange person . She's a lesbian -- she had a homosexual 
brother -- he was a tough guy, did all kinda crazy stuff, and she 
got busted for dope, and she's with a rough crowd , and they're 
just strange people altogether . So this was the old hotel -- but 
what I'm tryin to emphasize is that here it's not too bad - a lot 
of these buildings were here before the storm, and you can't say 
what it was like last year or ten years ago, so much has changed, 
p• 
but the further down you go, nothing is old. 
­
7 'V-
Everything down here is measured in before the storm and after 
04 
the storm -- everybody refers to something like, " Before Betsy," 
"Before Camille," or " After Betsy," " After Camille," Betsy was in .• 
'65 and Camille was in '69. Like this here, this was our 
property, that office was the only thing that was left. We had a 
qr'• 
little drug store, and six apartments, right behind the drugstc 
in a duplex on the lot behind it, 
and when Camille hit, the 
little office landed on the highway and the other buildings all 
got destroyed. 
r -'- •? I'm gonna show you the cemetery now. 
It was funny -- there's 
a little welding shop right -- Mr. Jack Arnold had a welding 
shop on the lower side the cemetery over there, and his uncle had 
! diedY a short time before the storm , and he and his uncle 
quarelled for years , they didn't speak for years, didn't get 
alo•g, and do you know that when the storm came, his uncle's 
casket landed on top of the welding shop , and it was so funny --
he said , " That old son-of-a- bitch didn't have any use for me 
r;F ,when he was livin , but he had to come back and see me after he ^• 
died. " 
It was hilarious. 
See this was all built after the storm, cur church was right 
here, Our Lady of Good Harbor Church 'and it was seventy -- eighty 
years old, and it cost too much to repair it, 
so he build a new 
one --
MH: Are there any big cemetery days? 
DC: All Saints ' Day -- November the first, you know, 
everybody cleans up the tombs and painter the tombs up and, 
MH: Do they have food? 
DC: You've got customs of the blacks -- this is a Yugoslav 
tomb -- see,•this tomb was built in 1909 -- the United Slovonian: 
,Benevolent Association , formed in 1874 -- the tomb was built.- in 
LFPAMH003 
1909 -- and ( Reads in Croatian) what that means is '
IT is tomb.was 
built for our brother Slovonians and their relatives -- we give 
this out of our heart to help one another, and this is a'monument 
to their perseverance." 
-azi 
TT: Do they still maintain a five-year -- in other words, 
you have a burial in number five, five years later you can come 
back and bury somebody in number five 
DC: Yeah -- the Slovonian Society's got five or six of those 
tombs -- they have em in different cemeteries in New Orleans --
that's the only one that they have down here -- they claim that 
-- It's just like my Daddy after Camille, that's one thing he 
told us, when we seen all the caskets, and we had to kind of help 
pull caskets around -- they were floatin after the storm, tie ' em 
to the trees and all - - he said, " Man, I never want to be 
buried here." That was his last request almost. 
TT: Do any people request to be buried back in the old 
country? 
DC: It was hard to bring a body back to the old country, and 
the expenses were high and everything. Let me show you something 
-- read this: This vault is for Mr. Machela and his wife. Mr. 
Machella is not dead yet, but when he is dead, this vault is to 
be sealed forever. This tomb is never to be sold. None except 
those of white blood to be buried in this tomb." Kinda strong 
isn't it? 
He was eighty years old when he built that tomb. 
TT: So if we were to just refer to Dalmations, how many 
people would we exclude? 
DC: Maybe half a dozen. We had in Empire the oyster fleet, 
of the owners, there are two that are not Dalmatian, but they're 
married to Dalmatians. So 
TT: The other Yugoslays have gone elsewhere in this country. 
DC: I'll ask around, and stay in touch, because to me that 
would be the easiest -- " Yugoslav" will resent some people, and 
"Croatian" will resent some people, but " Dalmatian" to me will 
stick. 
(Dalmatian dogs are supposed to have run with chariots in 
ancient times, but there are hardly any over there now.) 
DC: Let me show you the tomb of Uncle John Marenovich --
he was everybody's uncle, one of the nicest guys in the world 
he was from Ston on the head of the Peninsula -- he had a son 
TT: Has there ever been a conflict of interest with regard 
to military involvement. 
DC: No. The first man that ever was killed in Vietnam from 
Plaquemines Parish - is Joe Serkovich, his tomb"is right over here. 
He was Papa, Joe Franicevich's grandson. They used to live right 
there, his grandfathbr -- they was the last family to leave 
Ostrica ( sp.) -- across the river on the East side of the River. 
He came right after Hurricane Betsy. He wanted to help his family, 
move on this side of the river, and he went over there and got 
killed two weeks after^. 
That poor guy, he got killed, a mule kicked him. He had 
three children,;- and I think his wife is expecting a third one 
when he got killed. Mistich. That's an old Yugoslav family there.(; 
You got,different places in Yugoslavia that -- We're originally" 
LFPAMH003 
from the Ural Mountain area of Russia -- see the Slays all 
migrated down through the centuries to the Dalmatian Coast and 
all that stuff -- so we're the Slav family, Hungarian, Yugoslav, 
Russian, like Petrovich is a popular Russian Warne -- but with 
Yugoslavia you've got a lot of names with "- ski" -- like 
Franceski, La Volpicella, with Italian influence, on account of 
the Adriatic Sea, and once you get into the islands those people 
speak Yugoslav with an Italian dialect -- so it's -- Yugoslavia's 
got eight different languages, and everyone of them has a 
different dialect. 
When you look in the cemetery you're talkie about Icanovich, 
Icanovich were from near Dubrovnik; Mistich, they were from the 
Pelassius Peninsula; Zubich, Russich, they were from the island 
of Broch ( sps?) -- that's all Dalmatia. 
Hey, and you're talkin about 1898, 
1884, this one was born 
1898 
in Plaquemines Parish, you're talkin about before 
yesterday. They got their blood into this parish. The Franovich 
tomb. Old family here. 
1881. This old man was born down here, 
1886, his wife was born, she was a Skobeli. The Skobelis are from 
Dubrovnik. They got a tomb over here, Vidos -- from Dubrovnik. 
The whole family got wiped out in a car accident. Four of them 
got killed. 
Hebert. 
Shows us Serkovich's grave. He was killed in Danong. Funny, 
his mother and father were divorced, separated, when he got 
killed. And the father died a year and a half later, and the 
mother didn't want the father to be buried in the same tomb. Man, 
talk about, they had a big ruckus about that, and the son, they 
had to get involved to -- " Man that's our dad, and that's our 
brother too, and he deserves to be in it.
"' 
See, now this is a Yugoslavian, Bubrick, but it doesn't 
J. 
sound that way. They come from north of us -- in Bergerantz -
it's across the mountains maybe twenty miles from us. 
See this, Charlotte Blanchard -- her mother and father and 
my mother and father were best friends. Her brother is my mother 
and father's godchild. My sister was born March 17, 
1957, she was 
born March 15, 
so when her mother was comin out of the hospital, 
my mother was gain in, 
and what happened is the little girl was 
about seven years old and a mosquito bit her, and it was like 
yellow fever, same kind of virus and all, and she wound up dying. 
And my sister got married and everything, and this guy, everytime 
he seen my sister, he starts crying, thinking of his little girl 
What happens, the way they built these thins, you've got a 
underground vault type deal, and when someone else passes away 
they ,lust transfer the casket (?) 
When did they start doing this? 
In New Orleans you've got tombs that are over a hundred and 
fifty  years old, above ground tombs, oh yeah. 
It's chilly. It's mean when it's cold down here. 
See like, this girl, she got killed in a car accident, and 
she ,lust recorded a record, and she did real good with the record 
and she was a country-western singer. Rousseau's a Cajun name. 
TT: The society buries people who can't afford vaults, but 
do you have to be a member of the society? 
i 
rr. 
Well;'; . it's just like, they had an old man who was -a frien 
of ours,. and he wanted -- huh, that tomb, there was four of. '.m 
killed at one time in that accident -- they had an old man,'"- I.was 
good friends with, and he didn't have anybody, and he always-_-, 
wanted to -- This Semich ( sp?) tomb, that was two of the fathers 
of the big orange farms -- you know, that picture I showed you ' 
all? John M. Semich and John Semich, they were both in that 
picture. 
I think we're finished here. 
But you know, 
lookin at these names in this cemetery, 
it 
doesn't have too much a Cajun influence, I mean, you got, 
Ballet's French, they didn't come from Acadia, they came directly 
from France; Sill, that's French, Ragus, Buras --
TT: Lot of Buras here 
Well, the town was named after seven brothers from France, 
and they settled here, they were sailors, and that's how the town 
got its name, Buras. See now, this is a Yugoslav name, Muhoberac 
(sp?) but in the Yugoslav language they don't have an h and they 
have a little macron over the c and that would make the sound ch 
and so, a lot of em will have their names --
Can I turn this thing off? I got somethin I want to say that 
I don't want on here. 
( 
Later) 
They had this book, 
by Dr. Baloo, he was a historian here, 
and he wrote a lotta stuff, and you take these half-breeds, these 
mulattos, they can pass for white, you look at ern, 
and so the 
church -- See, 
like Rene Conovich, he was a fisherman, got a 
picture of his boat there? --
( 
later) 
Gettin back down here, you don't have'the Cajun influence, 
this is more, you get European influence in that the Yugoslays, 
the French -- the Acadian influence carne here with the oil 
industry actually, you know? 
Juritich, he died of cancer a couple years back -- about 40 
years old, workin for the oil company. But old man Rene was a 
fisherman, and that's cute ( referring to the tomb with his boat 
carved onto it) 
(end of side one) 
i-
i.3 
LFPAMH003 
BIDE TWO of LFP-AMH003 
Ostrica, which was straight across the river here, there"s 
nothin in Ostrica except a few fishermen's camps now. One time 
they had 2,000 people in Ostrica, and there's nothin there no 
more -- it's all washed away with the storms. 
(the road on the other side stops just below 
Hache) 
But at Ostrica they used to have a cannery, and, you see 
straight across the river, them few buildings and boats over 
there? That was the center of Ostrica, but Ostrica was all up_ 
in here, all the way to a bove Gu lf O il Company's facility, so 
then you had all these people, all these oyster boats are tied up 
here are all descendants of the people that lived in Ostrica 
most of these people were born in Ostrica and they wound up 
leavin Ostrica for Hurricane Betsy. 
See these small boats, like these barges, that's for shallow 
water. Extremely shallow water. That barge'll work in ten inches 
of water. And these guys they come in every night because they 
live right here, and the reefs are just straight across the 
river, so they don't even stay on the boats at all, whereas the 
Yugoslays up at Empire, th ose boats are rigged up, they'll go to 
Galveston and live on their boats, you see? 
But these are all Yugoslays, matter of fact, this is Joe 
Serkovich's brother, that owns that Miss Bonn ie , and it 's Joe 
Serkovich's uncles and cousins, all these other boats. 
But at Ostrica at the turn of the century, they had a 
canning plant, and my grandmother's brother came here in the 
early 1900s and they used to tell us about the plant -- that 
every season when they opened the factory they would have 500 
women come down from Chicago and work in the factory, and the 
factory used to stay open 8 months. So you can imagine how big a 
plant that was, and there's nothin there now. 
But you take Ostrica and Olga were your Yugoslav 
settlements, Olga had between six and eight hundred people and 
Ostrica had, they claim, two thousand people, but Ostrica died 
in 1947, the hurricane, 
it really tore up, and then they had a 
buncha other storms in the fifties and sixties that ultimately 
finished it off. 
(Solid land between the levees is a mile wide at the 
maximum) 
TT: Dees everybody go to public school down here? 
DC: You got in Buras, Port Sulphur, and also (?) Venice have-
the schools, and then they opened private schools between the 
storms when integration first started down here -- they closed 
the Buras private school last year and opened 'the Catholic 
school. 
DC: I've got a trailer I stay at down here, I've got to 
check somethin in. 
I bought it about six, seven months ago. 
What happens is, 
I like to have a place where I can take a 
nap for fifteen minutes, or I can stay there seven days a week, I 
don't have to go knock on anyone's doors to go take a shower or 
somethin. Got a nice place.

had everything, this was a big place, and the potential wasp- there 
to find somethin -- and yet there was nothin g nothin ever wrote`: 
about this place, that's really disgustin --
Hut you take from here down, this was solid oranges, all the' 
way down through here. Solid. They had, up in here, where this 
blue building is, 
used to be the co-op packing shed, and this 
building was one -- right here, 
it burned down, they had the 
packing shed, the inspector's office -- the state had the 
inspectors -- they would check the oranges. The Fasick M 
family, 
tti_ey had about 20,000 - 30,000 trees, and we went to school, had 
a private school -- and the packing house burned down, and they 
let us all out of school to watch the build}ng burn down. 
It was 
a big, big deal. But all this, this was solid oranges, all the 
way down, but now it's  nothin g you know, 
like  I said, the 
competition, with the oil industry, with the government, the 
sulphur industry, the farmers couldn't afford to pay those type 
wages, and then they couldn't -- the hurricanes, the freezes. 
MH: Are there many old-timers around? 
DC: They're goin fast, they're goin fast, really. 
MH: Any who remember things from back then, good 
storytellers? 
DC: They got a few, they got a few -- but this is where we 
were raised -- down here. They used to have at Fort St. Phillip 
(we're gonna ride on the levee down at Fort Jackson) at Fort St. 
Phillip John Vela had bought that reservation from the 
government, and with these -- when he bought that and he planted 
orange trees down there, and those orange trees were like thirty, 
forty feet high. When I was a kid, used to have a big fourplex 
apartment building there for some oilfield'people and a little 
store across the street -- and they had this house and that house 
-- this blue house is my house, but we used to have another one 
there, but Camille took it, and we ,lust bought the house second 
hand and moved it on that lot -- that house moved one mile -- it 
floated away, and our house landed in the canal all busted up. 
But this was solid orange trees. You could walk an hour through 
the orange trees, that's how far before you'd get to a house. 
(There are orange trees for sale, but mostly for peoples' 
gardens) 
I'd like to have the money spent on this Parish in levees. 
read in the paper that in 50 years, know how much they spent on 
levees in Plaquemines Parish? - 640 million doll 
Tax dollars 
and it's still not adequate - 
(Groves used to average 5,000 trees, now they average 400) 
After the curve down there, the Champion company -- all 
these Yugoslays, they bought this thing 
Dr. `John Booth who was 
a direct relative of"John Wilkes Booth who- shot Abraham Lincoln 
MH: How do they know that? 
DC: Well, it's in the records 
MH: That he was a cousin of -
DC : HT was from Virginia -- the Champion lands started 
somewhere down here -- this was the Yugoslays orange farm -- from 
here on down was solid Yugoslays-- Franceski, Selovich, Mistich, 
Cvitanovich, they sold it to the Buras family, and this was

cattle ranch -- we'll . stop here on`the way hack 
she's 84 years old. She used to make orange 
The orange wine that they made here was of European o 
uality, 
because these people made grape wine in Europe -- you know, your 
heavy burgundy wines and hearty wines like that, and when they 
made this orange wine, they made it on the same way with that, 
you know, you squeeze the oranges like you. would squeeze the 
grapes, put a lotta sugar and water and different things and let 
it ferment. 
This is Fort Jackson, and on the east side of the river you 
have Fort St. Phillip. Fort St. Phillip is privately-owned -- and 
is a lot bigger than Fort Jackson, it's not,as well developed as 
Fort Jackson -- they got a little commune over there, they got   
some people livin over there. But Fort St. Phillip was owned by 
John Vela, but he was in dustrious -- he bought it from the 
government, he was a Yugoslav, and he was industrious. He used to 
do everything crooked, he used to bootleg whiskey and all this 
stuff, and he was with Al Capone and he used to haul the whiskey 
from Cuba and that's where they would store it at, 
in the tunnels 
at Fort St. Phillip, so he wound up -- he died  in the earl y, 6Os, 
but he did all kinda stuff. You know what he even did during 
WWII? 
-_• TT: What? 
DC: And this is, this is rough. They used to import Chinese 
slave labor for the farmers in the Midwest -- okay? Cause it was 
easy to bring Chinese over, and what they would do, they would \ & 
store em at Fort St. Philli p, the ships would anchor- off, and 
V 
they would store the Chinese in the fort, and then when the coast • y 
was clear, they would put em on a boat and' send ern up the river, 
and all this stuff -- well this is a t it' I 
J' 
, 
s or y, 
s true though, 
that when someone turned him in that he was doin this, he had 40 
somethin Chinese left in the fort, and they wound up puttin ern in 
barrels and drowned ern in the river. He was a pirate I guess. 
(pause) 
See, this here, forms your lower crescent of the Mississippi 
River. You got a crescent at New Orleans. Your deepest point in 
the Mississippi River is right at Algiers Point -- you've got 300 
foot of water. This crescent's got 240 feet of water, and you've 
got your sand bar halfway across the river right here, and on the 
other side the river it drops real real deep and it stays deep, 
kinda snakes across, and further up it gets real deep again. 
It's' 
treacherous. Th 
t o 
ey have a lotta s hip acc id ents and all that, used 
-- 
Gettin back to the Yugoslays, we had, the Next colony was 
Olga, which was down- here, and I seen, when I was in the old 
country, I seen the Post cards that had the Olga post office --. 
they had a post office there till, I guess around Camille, then 
the- storm blew everything away -- those pictures of those old 
freight boats, everyone used to have wharfs, they used to go out 
into the river, and they would load up, and at Olga they would 
have three canals, and the different freight boat companies would 
come to the di=fferent canals, and they would each load up their. 
oysters, and these freight boats used to hold 3500, 4000 sack of 
oysters each, and they would make two or three..trips a week"down 
there - p;ickin ; aystergs up, and you know 
O1 a' s 
r 
g 
just a thing , fn 
everybody s mind,•nd it used to have • little lantern on the 
river, you know,- a little beacon, and the old post offi ce is 
still standin g bu t it' s all busted up,_trom the storm -)  
Bu_t_that's where th e fi rst Yugoslays came here. 
That's an orange grove 
a 
that died in the freeze last year and 
they never did anything with it. This was Bonnie Shonberger, he's 
the ex-sheriff. Now he's planting again at.Buras, but he's not 
even going to plant this grove. 
See, like, here on the river, these are all willow trees, 
and that's symbolic of sand. Wherever you've got river sand --
you see directly across the river, that white stuff? Okay, that's 
Grand Bay -- that's directly outside the limits of Olga 
Southern Natural Gas has got a big compressor station, Chevron 
3•`r 
Oil company, and one other oil company, but at one time they had, 
J 
up until Camille, they had about forty camps, little camps, just 
small two-room deals, and that's where all those Yugoslays would 
live, and it completely surrounded the bay and had numerous 
bayous to the south of the bay coming out over here where this 
red light is down the river, that's your Olga light, that's where 
the post office and the store was, and you had three different 
docks on the river -- You had Pavlovich dock -- was right here 
where these pilings are, and old freight boats used to come and 
they would load up oysters here, and at Jerjovich and Vela 
canals farther down, and that was the hub of activity, and I was 
tellin you about Moto Parun, at Bell Tower, okay, that's where 
he lived, and that's where he had his business. Now his property, 
I own his property today. I bought his property eight years ago 
from the Vela family -- 1200 acres of marshland, where the old 
store --
MH: Do you lease any of it to trappers? 
DC: Well, I give it to the trappers, I don't charge em. But •J•
OJA 
we did well w ith m inerals on those properties. 
(ie. oil) We paid 
for the property -- half interest in 1200 acres, we paid 60,000 
S 
dollars, and wound up makin a quarter of a million dollars. 
6,;1 a,,, 7I9-*• 
There's an old ship captain's house. 
MH: Are those marti n houses? purple martins? ' 
DC: Oh yeah -- now you see this area, all up in here? This 
Q
-
is all conti nu ing th e orange industry -- you ever -- one of these 
big firms, Walker Roma Dairies, have milk and everything else, 
they bought this farm here and they had planted 12,000 trees 
before Betsy. They lost em in Betsy and then Hurricane Camille, 
they replanted, wound up losin em again, and they gave it up. 
MH: What's the life expectancy of an orange grove? - 
DC: Weil, an orange grove'll last you thirty - forty years. 
The trees at Fort St., Phillip, 
let me show you ,"
see where tho se 
platforms are to the"north o f us, straight across the river? 
That's offshore -- the Breton Sound, that's a shallow part'of the 
gulf. -- about 12-14 foot of water. Breton Sound to the river is 
only four miles away, compared to on this side the river the Gulf 
is about ten miles away. The thing is, when you get these s tron g 
breezes from the Gulf, and you know the water of the Gulf is 
always warmer than the river, and on that side the river was way 
bitter for the orange trees. Where on this side of the river they 
died in the freeze, at Fort St. Phillip they didn't die in the 
LFPAMH003 
freeze. Fort St. Phi l 
l 
ip's trees died in 'the hurricane, from, salt w. 
-waterintrusion. . . . The further down"that you planted,- like 
ns 
Venice; Venice is closer yet to the Gulf, that was the best place 
to plant -- but like Belle Chasse, the property in Belle Chasse 
was worthless , because oranges would never stand the winter. From 
Port Sulphur down it's closer to the Gulf and the warm Gulf 
breezes. That 's what made this place good, but Belle Chasse was 
worthless , and now Belle Chasse property is worth tenfold 
compared to this property. But you don't have hardly any Yugoslav 
settlement in this Venice area. You had some settlement and some 
Yugoslav population,--but the thing was, you had the Bubrig, the 
Coludroviches, Jurisich, Jerjevich, but that was all people from 
Olga -- Machela -- you know, the old man with the tomb? They 
were all down at Olga and when they moved o`' 
this side the river 
they settled here , but there was very few left 
. . . Nothin here any more to invite any body 
the oil 
industry is dead, the fishing industry is dying, 
MH; The oil industry? ``__ • •4L" 
DC: Yeah, everytime that OPEC barrel comes down a dollar, 
it 6
 J 
chokes Louisiana a little bit harder and harder -- everything 
here is geared up on ail industry -- but everybody was used to •f' 
that high- price oil, and everything was built around that 
high -price oil. I'm gonna walk up on the levee a second here.

(The oil companies used to have a ferry that ran down here 
at Venice but Camille ruined that too) 
But just like this Venice area, you know, Boothville-Venice, 
this is just a cross-section -- there's a lot of Blacks --
TT: Are the Dalmatians politically active, inactive? 
DC: The Dalmatians are your most solid block of people 
if the Dalmatians are with you, they're with you a hundred 
percent, 
if they're against you, they're against you a hundred 
percent. . . . Judge Perez used to say that the most solid vote in 
Plaquemines Parish was the Yugoslav vote, but things changed. But 
you see all this area for hurricane Camille? Everything you see 
here has been built since 1969. Everything here has been 
destroyed in Camille -- nothin left here, nothin whatsoever. 
(Camille was worse than Betsy) 
DC: I think Plaquemines Parish, for the population, has more 
trailers than anywhere else. Well, another thing too, right after 
Camille, you had a moratorium -- all houses had to be built off 
the ground -- they had to be pilings to the roof, 
it was a good 
many years before you could build a house on the ground down 
here. 
(Insurance is expensive ) You're in the highest risk zone 
the United States, 
 in Plaquemines Parish, for hurricanes.  
(They evacuated the area three or four times this year. 
"It's a hassle" They':,take the boats upriver and tie them up in 
safe harbor. People go to the city.)

there, once that water gets in, where does it go? As long as it 
,yam 
doesn't come over that levee it's fine, but once it comes across 
that levee , say if you got a tidal wave like Hurricane Betsy --

TEXT: 
DC: Their grandfather was from Yugoslavia, and they were a 
hard-workin people, they started out in the oyster industry, you 
know, built up a big business, and you know we're really proud of 
them people. But they started out in the oyster industry and 
they're still actively involved in the oyster industry -- This is 
Venice. But you have Cvitanovich, Franicevich, and Serkoviches, 
and it's all Yugoslav people and Pavloviches and they all built 
up big marine transportation businesses 
this? 7T: Now are they lea v ing th e oyster business to go into 
DC: Well Franicevich is still in the oyster business, 
Serkovich is still in the oyster business, Popich is still in the 
oyster business, we're still in the oyster business, but we're 
doin other things besides. But this Venice has really grown into 
a really important oil port in the Gulf, you know, with service-
related industries. Do you know that rigs workin out of Pensacola 
and Panama City are all workin out of Venice? 
MH: What's this vegetation? 
DC: Those are mostly cypres s -- th a t' s some kind of a vine, 
more or less, growin there. 
MH: Looks almost like sagebrush 
DC: Yeah,rthis is basic Delta, you've not these trappers 
down here on the passbs, you even have a little church back here 
--- these are rough people down here, these trappers, Sabine, 
Cajun, whatever you want to call them." 
MH: What's Sabine? 
DC: Sabine's the Indian south of Houma and they kinda 
intermingled, Creole they call em 
TT: Is this the little group'right'here you're talkin about? 
DC: Yeah -- now they have a little colony of ern down the. 
Pass -- you have to get there only by boat, go down Grand pass --
:.; 
kinds to ,themselves, and they trap and fish, you know, HanYk 
Williams would lik e em, you know, they just lay their trout- line 
out and skin a buck, you know. 
TT: Are they Houmas? 
DC., No 
TT: Are they 
DC: Sabine and cross - section Cajun -- they're like the 
people in backa Go ld en Meadow and Larose, typical Coon-ass, 
excuse me. 
TT: When you say th ey 're rough do you mean that their 
lifestyle is rough or that they are personally rough 
DC: It's both. Their lifestyle is rough, you know they're 
kinda ignorant in that they don't accept a ;lot of things. They 
don't accept an education, and they 1 
i"ViL!F--off the land -- and its b 
the way it used to be, 
I guess -- \ 
(smoke off in the distance --  
probably) 
they're burnin waste oil 
. & ,A 
DC: Good alligator country there --
(a great blue heron , we see something swimming
'-- 
a couple 
of otters) 
DC: They're playful -- those are otters. I don't know might 
be a nutria -- nutria's got two fanged teeth in the front -- only 
reason why I think they're nutrias is that an otter's got a wide 
tail, and -- look at em, three or four or ern, 
huh? They look like 
otter cause they're big. Gat your nature trip today, hu ? 
There's Joe Serkovich, they used to live at Ostric4a, the 
one that got kill e 
in Vietnam? And Mr. Earl Hingle used to have 
a store in Ostrici•a and his store closed from Betsy or Camille, 
and he had this pet otter, and he was playin with the otter and 
the otter got aggravated and bit Joe's ear'off. So the fellow 
only had half an ear. That's the only thing I remember about him. 
They killed the otter after that. 
They have the Venice boat harbor back here, the commercial 
fishin harbor --
(brief discussion of Tom's tenure -- they transfer every 
three to five years. He's been here for two years) 
A dead nutria. 
Did you ever hear the story how the Nutria got here? The 
McIlhenny family owned Avery Island, they're the ones that make 
the tabasco sauce, and what happened, they brought the Nutrias in 
from Brazil -- a nutria's called a " Cayfew" somethin like that -
and the 1947 hurricane, that on Avery.Island, they had a bunch of 
these nutrias, they bred em and kept em in cages, and a hurricane 
came and destroyed the cages, and the nutrias went up all over 
the state, all over the southern part of the state, and nutrias 
are very, they're hard animals on vegetation and other animals 
and everything else,"And they spread like cancer. 
They're hard on the marsh. 
(The water hyacinth, water lily, 
is pointed out as another 
import -- they distributed it during the 1894 world's fair -- now 
it clogs a lot cif waterways) 
But do you know that there's a good point about them things 
too? In that they clear up the bacteria'in the water. 
See, these are all shrimp boats for native people. These are 
shrimp processing plants down here. That's what they call pass 
r-;! 
LFPAMHOO4 
Toffine, and that's Tiger Pass, that's the pass that ''goes ' figton 
the Gulf, the pass that - ii . the marine traffic uses. ' 
What else do you see different down here? 
MH: A lot of things. I never saw levees before. 
DC:"We don't know how to act outside of a levee' 
TT: You don't see too many sport boats around here, do you? 
Boras
DC: Not too much, you have your sport boats at Empire and 
-- 
This  oil really built this place, and what happened is once 
the oil industry started slowin down, 
it really took a hell of a 
blow on the local economy. See the river's high  right now. That's 
water lily -- see the broad leaf? In the springtime they'll choke 
off that whole pass. Only thing is, with that pass, 
it's got so 
much current it's not too bad. But where there's no current, 
whole bayous and whole canals will be covered with ern. 
MH: What do people do about it? 
DC: They been fightin em for the last hundred years, but - 
it's a hist o ri c battle. - 
MH: Is there much hunting with dogs down here? 
DC: No. The only hunting dog used is like a retriever. For 
ducks, but as to for deer, 
MH: foxes? 
DC: You don't have any foxes 
TT: How much deer is down here? 
DC: It's pretty good, especially down on the passes, at the 
mouth of the river -- by the ridges, you got pretty good deer. 
The state has that Bohemia management area on the other side the 
river from empire -- on the east side of the river -- and there's 
a lot of deer back there --
DC: Where you live -- in Chalmette? 
TT: Yeah 
DC: I went to Holy Cross, you knew, right there below the 
industrial canal? That's where I went to high school. 
TT: When I first carne down here I was working strictly at 
the battlefield 
(more discussion of mutual acquaintance -- a blonde park 
service woman he took on a tour of the bayou) 
DC: But all this stuff here, this is all oil - related, the 
service companies for the rigs 
MH: What do you do when you guide for the oil companies? 
DC; Well, 
like these drilling barges, big derrick barges, 
they'll cut locations, they'll call me, and I' l 
l have to show em. 
(comment on the white herons, a seagull) 
You know, when this 
lands was sold down here it was almost given away, nobody would 
take it, and now it's among the most valuable property in 
Louisiana. I'm tryin to look for a barge . Yeah,``this place 
floats on oil:' What'i really hurtin Louisiana is that Louisiana 
got so dependent on oil, 
it's almost addicted to oil, the tax 
system in Louisiana is geared up on oil, and everything else. 
Once the price of oil starts goin down, and it's continuin to go 
down, taues in Louisiana are just gonna skyrocket. 
See, you got a church across the pass over there. A gospel 
church or somet:;4 
MH: What's a pass? 
DC: It's a little  bayou, you gotta cross a little  bridge„Rol^ 
LFPAMH004 
somethin to get over there --
MH: Do you have any stores around that cater Dalmatian 
food? 
DC: A little bit -- I'll show you a place in port Sulphur on 
the way up, 
if it's still open. 
here? MH: Have any peopl e ma de m in iature landscapes of Yugoslavia 
DC; Not really -- well, % any time you see a painting of a 
seascape, you know, you think of Yugoslavia.'' 
MH: any particular- kind of seascape? 
DC: You know, with the mountains comin down to the sea 
MH: Do you have any Saturday schools for kids down here? 
DC: They had a deal where a lady was teachin Yugoslav in the 
schools in the schools on a Tuesday night, and the sad part is, 
took off like a skyrocket, and when it popped, 
it popped, you 
know, nothin happened anymore. There were a lotta people takin 
advantage of it too. She had like 50 students. 
MH: She was teaching the language? 
DC: Yeah 
MH: Are there any dance competitions? 
DC: No -- you've got this, up in Pennsylvania and in 
Minnesota, they have these Tamburitzins and they have the dancers 
and folklore costumes and everything else, and they travel on the 
circuit, you know and the tour, and we had them in Biloxi one 
year, they've got a Slovonian Society hall in Biloxi, and they 
brought ern down one year, they were on a tour, and one year they 
came to New Orleans. I was either out of the country or 
somewheres. I didn't go, 
but ray sister and mother went, and it 
was nice. 
In the 1974 centennial of the Slovonian Society they brought 
a guy down from New York to teach the girls how to dance, and 
•l 
they performed for the hundred year celebration. 
It was a real 
nice deal. 
It's a shame there's a void in the Yugoslav culture in this, 
respect of nobody carryi ng on thi ngs. 
l > 
What I like is in Empire, you'll see little Yugoslav kids 
playin, and not one of em speaking a word of English, they're all 
singin in Yugoslav -- I enjoy that. To roe, 
it reminds me of ray 
childhood. 
If I settle down and have a family, 
I'd love for anything 
for my children to be able to speak Yugoslav -- cause I think a 
person with two languages, that's two personalities all in 
itself. 
1. 
P 
The thing is, we still practice the language at home. 
I'm 
not trying to show off in front of other people, but I think it's 
a necessity . In ray business, dealin with the fishermen, for the 
oil..companies with the rigs and all, once you start speakin to 
the .fishermen in their native tongue, right away you've broken a *V 
barrier.

DC: Let me show you -- these.; wells that are-,ri ght here 
come in on those wells at my house, we"Dive ten dollars 
year, each one of us. There's seven wells right there, okay, ' but 
for the people that's got the land directly around those wells, 
they made a fortune, and that company been tryin to drill those 
wells for years and years, and Perez never would let 
he died then things started to open up a little bit. 
MH: He kept the oil companies at bay? 
DC: He stood on top of things. But, Louisiana 
to politicians like that, you know, Huey Long, and 
different parish that you have in Louisiana has some sort of a 
dictator who benefitted offa the oil cornpan}es with mineral 
leases and, it's symbolic. I hate to say it. 
This is a Yugosla 
guy. This is Popich. The one that owns 
those crew boats, that's his weekend home. The big tugs and all 
in Venice? That's his weekend home. He's got a beautiful home

TT: When they integrated 
segregate ern sexually? 
DC: No. What they did, first couple years, right 
Hurricane Betsy, they still left the black schools open, and they 
left the white schools open, and it was up to whoever wanted to 
90 -- sa I think the first year you mighta had 1` blacks. So 
finally, 
it wasn't mixin too good, the government wound up 
altering the Sunrise school and Scotlandville School -- those 
the two black schools. They shut ern down, 
the blacks 
merge into the white schools.

school board)

TT: What type of tourist industry do you have here? 
DC: Fishing brings it because the mouth o'the river is 
well-known for its big game fish -- tarpin, 
rnullin, sailfish, \s 
that brings people with money to `fish. But outside of that you 
don't have any tourist industry.•Some people will come just to 
see the mouth of the Mississippi River, the end of the river.'' 
(inside the trailer) 
DC: You have a lot of Yugoslays, but then there's such a 
transflux of outsiders -- with the oil industry and,everything 
else, You got a lot of people throughout the United States 
this has always,been the bread basket of America 
you had so 
much work goin on, and things are hard up in the hills of Alabarna4

and Mississippi, so quite naturally those people came dawn here. 
A lot of skilled labor from Texas came here, so Yugoslays are one 
of the native products of here. Like the Burases, you know, the 
Yugoslays always were known to be here, and the Yugoslays' 
developed a lot of things here. 
then? TT: But how larg e wou ld you say the mulatto population is 
DC: The Mulatto population, you've got, a big Mulatto 
Population at Buras, a big Mulatto population up at Eddie 
Phillips' area, City Price, Diamond, and you've got a fairly big 
mulatto population on the east side of the river. That's the 
three main areas for, the mulatto population. 
TT: Now the ones over here identify themselves with say the 
Cajun culture, the ones on the other side of the river don't, do 
they? 
DC: Not really 
TT; That's more black orientation over there 
DC: Another thing too, okay, it's not, gettin' back to 
Political. Perez did a lot of harm, but he did a lot of good. He 
brought the roads down to develop this place, and always fought 
for better roads, and up on the east side of the river you had 
some blacks that when they left here they went and got an 
education elsewhere. And you had a lotta Blacks that moved to 
California, and they got that West Coast attitude, and they got a 
little education and they carne back, 
and they carne back with 
Civil Rights lawyers and they carne back with -- not say, uh --
you know, these people they said, hey look what's goin on here, 
this is 1965 --
Standards that the blacks lived by were very poor, very very 
poor. 
1• It was just like  at Fort St. Phillip, Perez had leased that 
from the Vela family, when the old man died to put that stockade 
down there for H. 
Rapp Brown, and Martin Luther King and 
everything when they threatened to integrate the schools. Perez 
spent a lot of money. They still have the barbed wire post and 
everything else. Two hurricanes after that it's nowhere. It's so 
bad a cow can't ever, live out there. So Many mosquitoes and 
snakes and everything else, and he really scared the hell out of 
em -- Martin Luther King and them that time, cause they were 
gonna come down here, and the old man stopped ern. 
He put a wrench 
in their (?) 
TT: And that was intended to serve as a (?) 
DC: Yeah -- it's in the history books and everything, 
there's pictures of Judge Perez, symbolic with his big white 
cowboy hat and his big cigar -- typical boss 0) politician, and 
he was gonna impound Martin Luther King, and they had 
big 
signs and all put up'for racial agitators and everything else. " We 
got - a home for them." The place was all cement, there was no 
walls, no doors, no windows, the mosquitos and animals just eat 
you up out there. That's what I say -- Justice = " Just us" and 
that's the attitude they had out here. But the pe 
a were 
good to Perez he was good to them. Just like my father, you know, 
(?) -- It's the only way you could survive down here. 
If You,_ 
bucked Perez, the oil companies wouldn't hire your boats, the 
people were told not to go in your bar, 
it was a dictatorship.

When Delta Bank way opened in 1956, I was four months *oid,': 
okay, so my mom and daddy were there, and here I was in a little 
bundle, and as.,my mom and daddy were leavin, he hollered " Hey, 
don'tcha all leave! Come on back in!" So he gave me savings.. 
account number one, put a hundred dollars in that account, and 
called me his fourteenth grandchild. And, hell, those people, 
Daddy and them, 
it was a big honor to them -- Judge Perez was on 
the front page of the Times - Picayune -- He,glorified himself with 
a big fourth of July celebration - -talked about the communists 
and the bureaucrats in Washington, tryin to destroy our way of 
life and everything else, and then throw everybody a big 
barbecue, and free beer and everything else. 
It was unique. 
(back in the car) 
DC: You've got Yugoslays more or less in three categories --
those that are born over there and came over here, most recent 
ones; then you have the first generations ones; and also you've 
got the second generation ones -- the ones from a hundred years 
back, you know, maybe their grandfather carne from the old 
country, and they kind of intertwined into the population of the 
Delta, you know, 
intermarried back and forth with the Purases and 
other local native families. 
TT: Yugoslays have the representation in the cities too, 
right? 
DC: Right 
(Long silence) It was Just like, my grandfather had one 
brother that carne over here in 1895, and went back in the old 
country after WWI, about 1920, so this old roan died about five 
years ago, ninety - somethin years old, and he had a real sharp 
memory. I'd sit there and I'd talk with 
- 4 ­
=" 
alI, and then 
he'd start mentioning different Delta families, you know, native 
families and all, how's this family and that family, he had a 
sharp memory, and I'd say, well they got this and that in Empire, 
and then held ask me " Where's Empire?" and I'd say, " Well, 
whatcha mean?" He says, " Well, you talkin about the little 
canal?" I'd say, " Well that's Empire." Held say, " No, that's the 
little canal." And when he was here back then the town didn't 
even have a name, they had the little shrimp and oyster 
factories, the railroad used to come pick up the oysters there, 
c 
and that was as far as the railroad track went. 
I was amazed at 
' d 
-4Qj 
what all he remembered. 
TT: How long has it been called Empire, do you know? _ 
DC; They named it Empire after a riverboat, they had a 
riverboat called the Empire Parish -- and that's as far as it 
used to run was Empire. 
t 
(another pause) 
Everytime a boaK"comes out on Louisiana, I'll buy it, you 
know. Talk about little stories and all, you see Fort St. 
Phillip? You know, 
for some reason, I feel that that's my roots, 
that side of the river, with my great - grandfather and all being 
over there up until the 189` storra. 
The Velas were from Podgora, 
which is two towns over from us, 
in Igrane in the old country. So 
we had, everything was more or less the same type people from the 
same places and we al.l kinda stayed close. But when old roan John 
Vela died, he had three nephews in the old country, and he had 
I 
A. 
ti•; 6, x 
brought one of his nephews to this country. Matter of fact ;he had 
brought two of em, but one of em was here a t the time , and the ' 
other one went back . And old man used to live across the river at 
the fort. And old man made money, you know, head over fist, with 
-the oil companies , with farming, with oysters, with bootleg 
whiskey, and you know , he really made a lot of money. 
Well, what happened was, he had gonorrhea , and he never did 
marry, so he wound up leavin his estate to
'the three nephews. And 
when Old Man died in the early sixties he was worth two million 
dollars cash. Okay, cause this Old Man used to finance everybody, 
he was like the bank down there. And John Vela was a big 
humongous guy -- he was about six- seven, six-eight , big, big 
hands , this guy he was just a hunk of a man. When you look at 
J' 
John Wayne in the movies you think of John Vela -- used to smoke 
this big cigar -- just a big guy, and they said he was good as 
gold. So when he died he left each one of his three nephews an 
equal share of the fort , and he had `400 acres of land, so each 
one got 600 acres of land , plus 660,000 dollars. 
Well , the one nephew that was over here, was a playboy, he 
started gambling ,.
chasing whores and in two years time he wasc 
flat broke. Lost everything. He got to where he was losin so much 
at cards playin at Miljack that one week he bought seven 
cadillacs , you know, for the people that raped him playin cards 
-- they each bought a Cadillac that week, seven different guys 
got cadillacs , that 's how stupid he was, throwin money away. So •. 
he sold his share of the fort for little or nothin, to Frank 
Ashby , big oil man. \\• 
Leon, the other brother , is a cat, you know, he likes to 
live, a high roller and all this stuff, and so in Yugoslavia he 
decides he's gonna bug the politicians, he's gonna open up a go- -" 
go place with strippers and everything else, you know, on the 
beach and everything else? Well, that was totally against the 
law. Well, 
he wound up gett in in trouble, and he's 1 
ivin an 
extravagant lifestyle , he blew all his money. 
And then they had a third brother , his name was Ivan, which 
is John in Yugoslav -- named after his uncle -- Ivan, they tried 
to smuggle Ivan out of Yugoslavia in the early fifties , and what 
happened , it didn 't work -- there was a cold war right after 
WWII? And he wound up havin a nervous breakdown and he always was 
in and out of the hospitals , poor fella , and he was always to 
himself -- he'd be about 50 years old now, 
50, 
54, he was the 
oldest brother , and he got to where all he would do is dive, you 
know, dive off the cliffs ? You know, 
into the water, and just 
divin for different things underneath the water -- lived a very 
simple existence. %, $ 
He didn't spend one penny of that money. He put it in the 
bank over here, never'- `' did come to this country , but his uncle 
toid'hirn he had left it, the money would be in the bank. He left 
that. 
money in the bank. Never spent one penny. Never sold his 
share of the fort. 
The other two sold their shares of the forts, so they wog 
up with nothin, and he wound up, here's a guy with 660,000 
dollars in the bank. The old man's been dead twenty years, he' 
Just accumulatin interest over all these years . They wound up,., 
findin oil on the property , he started gettin these big checks, 
the - 
poor fella .
went divin- ane time, hit his head on a roc 
stood in a coma three months and died. 
So now the two brothers are millionaires again. 
TT: I'll be darned. 
MH: That is the most bizarre story. That's unbelievable. 
DC: Do you want to know the worst part? That's the only fort 
that was ever lost in the United States without firing a shot, 
because Leon and Peter each sold their shares far nothin, you 
know, they were both in trou bl e, and Ivan kept his share of the 
fort -- and now -- they just got a big royalty, a mineral lease a 
few months ago, they got 90,000 dollars between the two of them. 
That, you know, that's sad. 
TT: Is the commune gonna continue to stay out there? What 
kinds lease have they got? 
DC: Frank Ashby was the chairman of the mineral board -- his 
father, and Old Man John Vela were good friends. So when Old Man 
Ashby died, his request was that he be cremated, that his ashes 
be spread over Fort St. Phillip -- and at Fort St. Phillip they 
still got a bunch of old houses -- maybe three or four old houses 
left of the time during the Spanish-American war -- they were the 
officers quarters, pretty houses -- so the fort was overgrown, 
you know, nobody was over there in a couple of years -- you know, 
and there's vandals took their toll on it. 
Well this guy that formed these experimental farms down in 
Columbia and Brazil and all was lookin for a place to live -- you 
know, they just wanted to have a place that was kind of away, you 
know, and they wound up takin Fort St. Phillip. And they live 
over there, and this fella had emphysema and lung cancer, and he 
wound up killin' himself about three months ago, four months ago, 
and they had an article about him on the fi^ont page of the Times-
Picayune -- a unique commune -- they have retreats and all that. 
There's still about fifteen people left livin over there. 
TT: But the head guy of that commune died? 
DC: Yeah, Arcana Christos -- he was dyin and he wound up 
shootin himself, but you oughta see the kids. The children over 
there are geniuses. Self-educated. They have those Apple 
Computers over there, a little girl, ten years old. I think she 
can make an atomic bomb on an apple computer. And they self-
educate em. 
It's amazing. They're brilliant. 
DC: We got a real nice plantation house right up here. And 
this plantation house belonged to the republican carpet bagger 
governor of Louisiana -- he was the governor of Louisiana after 
the reconstruction -- you know, during reconstruction after the 
Civil War, and this guy was a liberal, and he was a carpet bagger 
up north. You know, they refused to ever let anybody Have a 
building permit -- to restore their old plantation houses? 
There's two of em, and t 
hey' re beyond repair now. 
It's  pitiful. 
TT: Somewhere here along the right? 
DC: Yeah -- Magnolia Plantation 
(more on this subject) 
MH: I can see why you'd want to have a trailer down there. 
This is a long driver 
(What convinced him to get the trailer was making the trip 
every day four days in a row, returning home at ten o'clock at 
night, and getting a- message on his machine to catch a boat out. 
of Venice ( 7) at four in the morning. He had to get up at t 
o'clock. Now he's got answering machines in three places.)
