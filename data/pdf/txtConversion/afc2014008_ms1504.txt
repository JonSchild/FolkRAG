Spring l9;
 
The name pf this course is ethnoin Oee]  r

ethnomusicology.
 Since this is one of the rare cases on the camp
 
in which a course is named accurately, I
'm rather proud of it s
rei
 
like to say a few words about why it's called ethnot
hogical musi.
 
instead of ethnomusicology.  The fact is you will not come out of
 
this course an ethnomusicologist.

you sh ould also be an experienced anthropologist, and you probatny
 
should have evolved an area of specialization in which you can put
 
both of these things together.
 People who are highly competent a

well trained musicians, highly competent and well trained anthro
1r t
 
and highly competent people within a culture area --(which implieo
 
knowing the language, which implies knowing a great deal about tk

found amongst the population.  TkaX There are not very many ethnoo.. -

 I

soor-

 I
'd like to start examining with you
 
r
ik it may be important to teach this course,
 
;
hether indifferently or well.
 
long time ao on this campus,  tnere was an anthrcpe e-
st who had worked for a number of years amongst the Eskimo and whose
 
narticupar interest was in Eskimo sculpture, Eskimo art.  He was
 
on a film about Eskimo sculpture and he was trying to raise a lit ,,.(
;
 
bread, and so he was showing some of the footage imam to peopLe from
 
dl
iferent departments, and he started talking about why he was inter-
rted in Eskimo stone carvings.  And he said that anthropologists go
 
•
 s
ound the surface of the world and they look at people and they try to
 
:
igure out what it is that makes them able to survive.
 What does man
 
really need to -ha
-re, need to do, need to have within his environment to
 
keep him alive.  That's what we're all after, you know, that's the f
irst
 
L
aw of l
ife -
-
 
just to make it  on some kind of level or another.
 
r
.
 
he ssid the reason we're interested in hokimos (
be-
cause there're not very many Eskimos, you know,  just a few -
-
 most
 
people who can live anywhere else
 so).
 Still we spend an awful amount
 
of time studying Eskimos, though they're such a miniscule part of the
 
world population
 because -
-
 as he put it -
-
 Eskimos are up against
 
the absolute maximum in environmental pressure.  They only have time to
 
a that they have to do in order to stay alive.  They are
 
ry moment for survival, and therefore we can look at the
 
L
okimo and say to ourselves: if they could get along without it, the
 
:
okimos wnuJdn'i bother to do this.
 
And so we look at them and we discover that one of the
 
things that Eskimos do is art.  This puts an entirely± different cor
n-
piexion o
n our view of art -
-
 or it should.
 It may be, you see ,we
 
may discover -
-
 we certainly have evidence to this effect -
-
 thot ex-
pressive behavior, whether it is in terms of stone carving or in terms
 
of song or in terms of dance or in terms of story telling may turn out
 
to be as essential for survival as fishing or hunting or the certain kinds
 
of rules that enable man to live in groups ox and get along with each
 
other, or—
_oT
 rnrn,r+1L.. There may be as vital a function per-
formed by the various kinds of art as is performed by all the other kinds
 
of behavior that man engages in.
 
Understanding music, then, may be as important as u
iioer-
standing socialization!  Understanding why Eskimos make sculptures the
 
way they do maybe as important as understanding why he fishes the� way
 
he does.
 
And he talked a little bit about how they make their scuir-
tures.
 They pick up stones -
-
 there isn't anything there to make sculp-
tures out of except stones -
-
 and they begin to chip at it.
 (
Jometimes,
 
of course, they use bonex fragments as well) and they turn it around
 
and around and they say,  "What's inside of you?  What's in there that
 
wants to come out?  Is it seal?  Is it walruxs?  Is  it ptarmigan?'  And
 
he keeps chipping and talking to it until finally he brings out of the
 
stone the thing that he sees is there.
 It's always something very impor-
tant to him.
 Eskimos don't make statues of things that aren'
pretty
 
useful.
 
And then when he gets it -
-
 they're little bitty th
 
they don't have big boulders, you know, you don't have the artist hack-
ing away at the nine foot hunk of granite -
-
 basically they're pretty
 
small and they come out to be about this big.  He had a shoebox full a
t
 
several hundred of them -
-
 teeny tiny things, and I askec him where  e
 
got them, and he said,  I picked them up.  hecauoe when the IsKimos  '
ot
 
through making a sculpture, they throw it away. I mean, wh t  olso
 
g .oing to do with it?  I
'hey're misratory p

Xj
 it
 
-
 
that's really the important thing.
 It's not the statue -
-
 it's the
 
making the statuey that seems to be important in Eskimo life.
 In other
 
words, you have to look at Eskimo carving as an act of behavior; you have
 
to do something to make it happen.  And just as a sculpture has to be
 
turned around almost completely from examining the thing (which is what
 
we like to look at -
-
 we're a very "thingy" culture -
-
 all of us have
 
ten million things that we like to k file and put in drawers and sort
 
and we enjoy making patterns out of these things and be logical about
 
them and so on, but we think about the things. 
'
,nd we want to put them
 
somewhere and we want to display them and so on.
 
But the Eskimo point of view appears to  be -
-
 and 1
'm
 
not an expert on Eskimos, I
'm just trying to cite for you the example
 
that Dr. Carpenter gave -
-
 that it's the process of 
the thing,
 
a±±  it's the action that's important.  Abd this, you're going to find,
 
is a very important and interesting dimension to carry into your consider-
ation of music.  Because when you get right down to it, music itself is
 
also an act of behavior, and very importantly so.  You have to do some-
thing to make a noise.
 If nobody does anything, there isn't any noise.
 
You have to breathe, you have to hit something, you have to connect at t
o
 
the e vironment in some kind of re lation or other in order to make music
 
happen.
 
d so we can distinguish two points of view in thinking
 
about music.  You can think about it as an act of bahavior.
 Or you can
 
think about it in terms of an abstract that you pull out and say: this
 
is the substance.
 I can say to you, you see,  "le will now consider
 
Twinkile Twinkle Little Star and we can all sit here and consider
 
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and we won't have to do very much about
 
it except consider it.
 In other words, we don't have to have a per-
formance of Twinkile Twinle Little Star in order a to think about i.
 
There is an abstract melody that probably most of you know and that you
 
can think about in your head, and you wouldn't really care -
-
 it wouldn't
 
be germane -
-
 whether it was being played by a brass band or sung by a
 
little girl walking down the street.  There is that abstraction, and
 
that is one of the ways of talking about music.
 It's normally referred
 
to as the analytic method, in which you abstract from any given per-
formance those elements of the music that are easily packageable.  And
 
normally you write those down, and you count the number of intervals
 
and you figure out the scale -
-
 you can play all kinds of games, working
 
from the axim analytic point of view.
 
Because eseential to the process of abstraction is the
 
development of some kind of score.  Bow a score is to music in performance
 
zpigk roughly as a blueprint is to a building.
 It's about the same
 
relationship -
-
 it just gives you an idea of the architecture of the
 
thing.  Now you know yourselves -
-
 those of you who can handle written
 
music and there are probably very few, because although we have attempted
 
to make ourselves musically literate -
-
 I think it's been in the education
 
manuals for about a hundred years that every child was going to learn how
 
to read music no child ever has as far as I can tell (and that's because
 
the teachers don't learn it, because they think it's so hard and they
 
manage to ease past their music classes without learning how -
-
 and it's
 
too bad, it's not all that tough ).
 It's a very useful tool, but if you
 
really think about looking at all those dots and blobs
 and lines on the
 
paper, it doesn't have very much to do with the way the music may sound. 
if you think about the variation between a full Suusa band rendition
 
of *s±  ±
*xai
 
(
dadeahing the monkey wrapped his tail around the flag-
pole) and what I just did -
-
 well there's a big difference in there.
 
But I could score that for you, if that's what you want to know; I could
 
w r it e  It down on the board -
-
 it would take me a little while, but J
 
could, and then you would go home and you would have this thing. 
Bow 1 think this is very characteristic of our culture, as
 
said,  t
o enjoy having things, and oneof the reasons that we like
 
having things is that they are very convenient to buy and sell.  And this
 
has
 
ix certainly been one of the ways that we have handled music: we have
 
insisted on the process of abstraction, and I
'm not trying to put ab-
straction down -
-
 it's a darn useful thing to be able to.o.  But
 '
in
 
just pointing out that we L ie almost all of our emphasis into  he ab-
stractj
.on kind of thing and thus this fits really well into our who]e
 
concept of the  rofessionalization of music.  You see if you think of
 
music as something that exists in a score that you can't read, then you
 
can't cope with it very well and you have to hire somebody to cope with
 
it for you.  And these people get to be professional musicians, a
ris
 
everybody else gets left outx of the musical
 process, because these peopir
 
become the pros and their word becomes the word as far as music goes,
 
and nobody else gets very much time.
 
Furthermore, you see,  this enables us to do s very coin s-
cated thing which we have done consistently not only with music but with
 
everything we do and that is: we create markets.
 It is very characterh't n
 
of our society to go around the world creating demands for our products.
 
(
ve're having problems with that right now if you read the morning paper - 
he devaluation of the dollar and all) But this is one of the ways that
 
we have been able to become an extremely wealthy and powerful country.
 
And in the area of music we have behaved in a very characteristic manner;
 
e have gone around and said,  "We have a marvellous musical system,
 
and we have it in a very convenient packaged form.
 e can sell you scores;
 
'e can sell you records; we can se l
l you tapes; we can sell you machines
 
to play this beautiful music back on; and we can drown out your music
 
wan."
 
because we have the biggest loudspeakers in the world
 
J4 And so we can
 
go in there and sell this package that in effect says, your music isn't
  
really very good because you don't have all this hardwere  to go w
ith
 
md as a result, the local musicians gets out of a job because he can't
 
bop it like the record from the States can, and he gets to sound a little
 
bit old-hat.
 And, what do you know, first thing you know we've got a
 
very good x market for our records and our machinery and all the rest of
 
it; and if there is any local compettition at all, it becomes a competition
 
to make machines cheaper, as we see in Japan now, where they are really
 
undercutting us in terms of turning out recordings and particularly
 
machines.  Tape machines and record players are coming out of Japan and
 
really undercutting the American market.
 
n
 But they're not trying to undercut us musically, because
 
we've already convinced them that their music isn't really very good
 
compared to ours.
 
Okay, so this is a process that is seen going on, and there
 
is one other little wrinkle that I might as well mention, now that I
've
 
gotten wound up on this topic.  Another thing we do, by our extremely
 
clever use of the analytic method is we write down all their best tunes.
 
And we fix them up just a little bit, and then we can sell them back,
 
you see.
 We can out-Calypso the Calypsonians, because we've got it a
 
little bit nicer, you see.  '
We've got their best tunes, and we can write
 
them down and make a product out of them and-- what do you know -
-
we
 
can turn around and sell them right back.  Because we can put in }h I
 
Sptalny and his seventy-five strings and that kind of softens it down
 
little bit, it's not so square and African as it was before, it needed
 
little bit of fixing up.xxa And then yeu've  ot semethirs thet  -
-rrrr
 
0.
 
will firmly convince everybody that their own music just needs a little
 
bit of American know-how and it will be okay.  But we get to  et the
 
money.
 
Now this is one way of thinking about music, and as I
 
the analytic method, by which you turn the music into an abstraction
 
and
 
put it into forms such as a score will give you just a kind of sug-
gestion as to what the music ought to sound like -
-
 this method, I want
 
to be sure you understand, can be used in very important investigations
 
into the nature of music.
 I do not mean to attack the method itself;
 
sinister
 
all i
'm suggesting to you is that it does have a/degree of mixiximr
 
cultural fit with all the ways we like to deal with problems.  And it
 
can be a very dangerous approach, if that's the only approach that's
 
taken.
 
Sa y
 
Now the other approach is very frequently referred to as the
 
synthetic approach.  You don't have to know these two terms -
-
 I want you
 
to know the approaches, I don't care what youcall them.  And the synthetLc
 
approach looks at music as an act of behavior, and in effect, sees music
 
as something that happens at a particular time in a particular place.
 It
 
looks at or listens to or thinks about music as it is performed, not as
 
an abstraction.  Now, the advantage of ethnomusicology, it seems to me,
 
is that on the whole they have been forced to use both the analytic and
 
the synthetic method.  Western musicology really stresses the analytic
 
side of things, but ethnomusicologists have really come up against a
 
major problem in trying to write down the music of the world's surface,
 
because they have crazy scales that we don't have anything to represent
 
with.  They have funny sorts of rhythms going on there and it's really
 
very difficult to score.
 So that the analytic people have I
n
,
-
!d to invert
 
machines to do this kind of analysis for them.
 
MR
 
So that we have Charles Seeger at ICIJh inverting the
 
meio raph.
 You can now p±ay music into it and it will not only give
 
you the melodic line but it will tell you how loud it is at various
 
points and it will pull out for you two or three of the things that are
 
going oni when music happens.
 We have various very delicate machines
 
that measure time as well as pitch frequency; we have all kinds of ma-
chines and hardware of this kind and a good ethnomusicologist uses them
 
for very good purposes and very good reasons.
 
But that's awfully tedious, and it gives you an awful lot
 
of it data you don't know what to do with and it's very hard to under-
stand it.  And first thing you know you're into higher mathematics if
 
you involve yourself exclusively with this kind of machine approach.
 
An awful lot of ethnomusicologists have simply had to listen to the
 
music and think about it as 4, human beings, This is the essential di
l-
ference between the analytic and the synthetic methods.  Now we will.
' he
 
using the synthetic method mostly in this class because in order to use
 
the analytic method properly we would have to -
-
 in the first place, J
 
would have to teach you scoring, I would have to teach you how to use
 
all this hardware and I would have to teach you how to handle the system
 
of cents and this is what you should eventually know if you decide to go
 
into this field.
 
But it isn't terribly important for those of us who just
 
want to sit around and listen to this music and try to figure out what
 
it's like.
 L
3
o we will be using the method of just going after the music
 
k
)UI
 
and listening to it# we relate it -
-
 along with all of our experiences -
-
to other experiences we've had before.  You've all heard music, you all
 
know a little bit about it; and we will be using that common base-line
 
experience as a sort of comparative measurement with which to work.
 
Now this involves an assumption which may bother you for a
 
while.  After a while I think you will get kind of used to it.
 AnJ-t1
 
RERNMptim
 
IC
 
nd the assumption is this:
 that we are going to think about music as
 
something that human beings do and that other human beings respond to.
 
'
e are not going to think about music as something that specialists do
 
and that only specialists can understand.
 In other words, what I
'm  -
oIrig
 
to have to do for a while is to sell you on the validity of your own
 
expertise.  All of you are pretty good musicians; all of you are brin
i
lg
 
a  reat deal ofexperience in listening to music in this kind of frame-
work.  But we continue to feel somewhere deep down -
-
 I think because of
 
this problem of professionalization -
-
 that we really can't hear things
 
right and we ought to have somebody tell us what we're listening to, and
 
then maybe we can reo1 y hear it if we're good and if we really work hard
 
at it.
 
If that were the way music was, it wouldn't be, nec ,3
use
 
why would anybody bother?  It reminds me of Charles Seeger's remark
 
about the possibility of machines composing music.  He said he had no
 
reason to assume whatever that a Moog synthesizer or whatever it is
 
can't compose music; he said the problem was to find
, a good machine to
 
listen to it.  The message would need to go through i
 in
 
order to be understood.  And if you are a machine, then a machine can
 
talk to you, but my suspicion is that most people
 will not come to
 
like machine music very much, since we seem to be moving in the opposite
 
direction at this time.
 
So we're going to take music as a standard normal act of
 
human behavior that everybody does whether they like to think about it
 
or not, in which every member of the human race has engaged .  You all
 
have made music, you all have listened to music, and so you become, in
 
effect, the instrument for understanding for yourself what the kinds of
 
impressions are that you're getting from music.  Because if we look at
 
music as an act of human behavior, we will find out that this is
 
ii
 
determine , thrt is, there are certain behaviors that  '
ork within cer-
tain societies.  Personally speaking, I •
 do anything I want to at this
 
moment.  Actually, my limits of behavior are pretty severe.
 I just lit
 
a cigarette, and I really shouldn't have; I went ahead and did it because
 
it's okay, but I had to think about it for a fraction of a second and
 
decide.  On the other hand, I wouldn't take a drink, Or if I did, I wo uld
 
expect to have problems.
 I wouldn't stand on my head, I don't think.
 
''
here are quite a number of things
 
I/ouldn*'t do under this particular
 
set of circumstances in which I an technically a free agent
 
In other words there are behaviors that occur within a set
 
of circumstances and behaviors that don't occur in the same circumstances.
 
:
o that each culture will have pulled together certain kinds of behav or
 
out of all the crazy things in the world that a human being can c
a  an
 
they will say: this is music and this is the kind of music that will nap
-
per under these circumstances and they will say this kind of behavior is
 
appropriate within a musical situation and this kind of behavior is not.
 
There will be all kinds of special degrees of fits of the music to the
 
normal behavior patter of the society -
-
 right?
 
So that we can, it seems to me, enlarge our original as=
 
suirrotion to say that musical behavior probably has something to do with
 
the other kinds of behavior that the society considers appropriate.
 It
 
must fit in some way or other.
 It has something to do with the kind of
 
behavior that the society considers appropriate.
 And this is realry
 
what we're going to be looking at.
 
So for those of you who feel that you are handicapped
 
musically, you are not handicapped by virtue of the fact that you are
 
a human being and that you live and operate within your own culture.
 
And you have had musical experience to one degree or another.  You also
 
know a great deal about standards of behavior and the way your own society
 
works.
 So now we're going to begin to look into other cultures and try
 
to figure out how their music fits into their society, and relat
 it
 
back to our own experience.  And every one will be the expert.  You are
 
listening to the music, and what you hear is there.
 
wx
 Now suppose you are quote, tone-deaf.
 Iexpect
 
in your autobiographies that some of you will tell me that you are
 
tone-deaf.  Tone deafness, as far as I am concerned -
-
 some of you music
 
majors may correct me, I make an open invitation for you to correct me
 
if I misstate things musically speaking because I am inclined to do that
 
especially when I get involved..
.,
., So far as I am aware there is no proof
 
that there is any such thing as tone deafness; there is deafness, and
 
if you're deaf, you're deaf.  You can also be deaf in certain regions
 
and not deaf in others.  There are certain people who don't hear very
 
high frequencies and those that don't hear very low frequencies, but
 
that's being physically deaf.
 
If you speak in a normally inflected manner, you are usIng
 
a series of very refinedly calibrated pitches in order to make your
 
speech understandable; you are in effect singing a song.  You might try
 
as an experiment some time becoming a monotone and (doing it) talking
 
on one pitch all the time without moving your voice up and down at all.
 
And you notice how, when I try to do it, it forces me to start not only
 
fiddling with the pitch but fooling with the rhythm.
 I can't monotone
 
except like a machine because it just has to come out that way (regular±
 
beat) in order to keep me on the same pitch.  You see what happens and
 
how xx unusual that is?  If I spoke to you that way in the hall, you'd
 
say something was a little bit crazy with me, wouldn't you?  Or suppose
 
I spoke in an inflectedly inappropriate manner with my voice going up
 
and down in peculiar places -
-
 you would notice that too.  And you see
 
I
've exchanged a few words with most of you and I know that you speak
 
in an appropriately inflected manner, which amounts to singing a rather
 
restrained and refined little song.
 It's a very small song, but it's
 
a pretty song.
 We could score it if you want to.  And al
l you have t
o
 
do  if you woat to sin  is just stretch that out a hi t -

(
iuestion inaudible)  2ixtmg Tone-deafness so called has to do with re-
plication; I think you're exactly right there -
-
 that's what people are
 
thinking about when they say "tone-deaf".  And replication or xrpmatixg
 
being able to repeat tones has to do with practice.  But what happens,
 
you see -
-
 and this is something I hope to goodness if you get anything
 
out of this class,any of you that are going into education -
-
 one of the
 
things that I urge you with tears in my eyes to never never never do is
 
to tell somebody they can't sing.  Because they will believe you.
 They
 
will believe you until they die.
 I mean they will go all their lives
 
believing that.
 I think it's worse to tell somebody they can't sing thor
 
that they can't draw or that they can't spell or that they're a liar or
 
almost anything else you can say, because really what you're doing

ins
 what does that involve  to the person who's doing it?
 
e up this whole area (
throat) and this happens to be a
 
very important area.  Yo8 talk out of it, you sing out of it, yuu eat
 
through it and you breathe with it.
 So in effect this is an emotional
 
statement which seems on the order of drop dead.
 It has that very deep
 
roychological impact especially if it conies from on authority
 
fi g
ure like a
. teacher.
 
I used to teach a guitar class a long time ago -
-
 grown-ups--
and peorle would come up to me -
-
 it happened class after class after
 
class and they would kind of sidle up and I would always know what was
 
c
oming because they would look terribly embarrassed and they would say
 
a tones that suggested they had some kind of social disease, that they
 
can't carry a tune.  Very quietly and very embarrassed.  And I would
 
start asking them how do you know you can't sing and it would always
 
turn out to be that somebody had said they can't carry a tune and I
 
would say, "Well, did a lot of people tell you?"  "Oh no, I never sane-
 
a
iy more."  So you only have to do it once, and you have effectively
 
:p another human being for the rest of their lives, unless they
 
-
.,,
to somebody like me who has dedicated a good deal of time to
 
teaching people how to carry tunes, because I think it's absurd not to
 
be able to enjoy yourself musically.
 It's a perfectly standard human
 
thing to do.
 
But it does have a lasting emotional impact and I simply
 
don't believe it in most cases.
 It's a question of not having had enough
 
practice in replication. Or you can have the kind of circumstance that
 
happened to my daughter who happes to sing very well.
 She had a low
 
voice; when she was a baby, she laughed way down here.
 She told me when
 
we were chattingabout something when she was in high school that she had
 
never sung a note all the way through school.  And I said, "Corey, don't
 
he sh iv; you were in the chorus, every year you were in the Glee Club."
 
Tho she said, "I never sang, I just moved my lips." I said,  `,
,hy on earth?
 
And she said, "Well they would come around at the beginning of every year
 
and they would say sing a scale and I zXdxxax±dxzixg could sing a scale."
 
And she could.
 "And they would put me in the chorus and they would pitch
 
everything so high I couldn't hit it
x and so I just moved my lips."
 
For twelve years she moved her lips.  Children are so good.

hK now I was talking to you last time about the notion
 
synthetic and the analytic method of going after music tryingi
 
it into some short of shape where you can talk about it and I
 
get around to telling you that I came across this concept first

'
ained in the classic tradition, 'which isn't very old but has already
 
come classic ")
of western ethnomusicology under a fellow by the name ci
'
 
.ric Hornbostle.
 We have a tendancy tcresounding and ipressive names
 
icology and Dr. X Von Hornbostel is sort of the father of
 
nomusicology.  He actually got the discipline started off
 
and his major contribution besides starting it and setting some very
 
impressive track records of his own was to set up the great archives in
 
w
 
Berlin.  Berlin ±s here everybody goes to study even today, although
 
some
 
of the archives were damaged during world War II.  The Berlin Archives
 
ar1 the great repositories for the musics of the world in recorded fors
.
 
and it's just the place where most si the
 
ethnomusicology has come
 
I keep saying western oecaase you sho ic1 never i

that a tremendous amount of work has been done by eastern people,  o
or
'ticu—
 
larly xxxtmxxx ii Indians.  There has been a tremendous development of
 
musicology in India; they have a tremendous number of publications.  There
 
are also great schools in China and great schools in Japan.  But for the
 
western world, tk Berlin is the place where it all began.
 
Another name that you may wish to know about is Kurt S

who also studied under Von Hornbostel during the early days.

is primarily known for writing a number of very important books, one of
 
which is on your bibliography, but his name has been most widely known
 
because he develoced
 system for c1ossifyini musical in
.struoento which
 
x x xa
 -
 
is standard now and is in standard use around the world including the
 
Orient.
 It's a very handy way of classifying instruments, and the Sacas
 
cation scheme we will go through in class.
 I like to mention
 
this kind every once in a while, not that I
'm going to ask you
 
t
o oat o le
 all of these differences, but because I think it's cruciol
 
to  ro ize that in every field there have been people In the post  ;
ho have
 
made contributions that had to made in order for us to be as far along
 
we are now.  And I like people to have some sense t-ot
 dtin't ma:e
 
all up in my head this morning before I came in here.
 
iO W  this notion that Dr. Kolinski was taikirib about c
ii
 
otinction betwen the analytic and the synthetic approaches to music
 
Te  yo u  in  a  highly decorated form yesterday, that is, I war
:  emirni
.-
og from my own experience on the fundamental idea, tut I t
rioc
iont lou
 
might be interested in hearing more what he said, which will also serve
 
to review the concepts for you, just a smitch.  He said that you could
 
approach music from the synthetic position by lister4ing
 to the musIc
 
and bringing your own experience both in terms of musical background and
 
listening experience to the music.  This may, of course, ± result in
 
projective or, indeed, ethnocentric statements,  You see 
)if you re
r
 
music from the perspective of your own experience entirely.
 
And this brings up a topic that we're going to have to come
 
to some kind of grips with and that is the concept of ethnocentrism.
 It
 
x
m is a problem that you face in every kind of social science discipline,
 
but more than that it's a problem you face in your every interaction with
 
other human beings.  Ethnocentrism -
-
 and there are a lot of people in
 
here who are not anthropologists and this may be a new nine dollar word
 
for you -
-
 if you divvy it up and get the ethnos part separate from the
 
centrism, you can get an easier notion what it means.  The ethnos comes
 
from a Greek root, which means people or )expanded,
 mean culture, or
 
nation or some unit of  that kind.  And what it says then is that you
 
yourself see yourself as in the center of the universe and everything
 
relates to you.  Now naturally everyt4ir
tg to a certain degree does this.
 
11
 
Al
l Gods children got ethnocentrism -
-
 there s no way around it.  There
 
is noww way we can understand experience without relating it to our own.
 
e see, in effect, by contrast.
 We see parallels and we see contrasts
 
and we see differences -
,rd we see similarities and it always keeps o
catn:
 
back to us all the time.
 
Now the critical thing about ethnocentrism is to understand
 
that you have it, and this is the mark I think between a reall sophisti-
cated and educated individual and somebody who's never thought about th l
l
 
but just thinks he's the hub of the universe because there he is, I mean
 
obviously, he's the hub of the universe to himself.
 If you understand
 
the nature of ethnocentrism, why it's important and how it works, you
 
can allow for it in your own thinking because you have to deal with it.
 
I think the best illustration of the problem involved here
 
was a story that my brotherinlaw ± told me a number of years ago.  He
 
was on a, he was a radio operator on a merchant ship in World War Ii
 
and they were sent to Iran, to a port that had been very hastily± jumped
 
up in order to get oil out in some quantities; there really wasn't any
 
town there, it was just a sort of a port, a dock essentially.  And durin
 
II in order to confuse the enemy at that time, ships worked under
 
sealed orders and they often went somewhere and they didn't get any
 
word and they just had to stay there until they got orders to go somewhere
 
else.
 So they went to this bleak little port and sat there and sat there
 
anda sat there and there wasn't any town there, just some warehouses
 
and things, there wasn't very much to do, just a few people, a few familes
 
and my brotherinlaw got acquainted, made friends with a little Iranian
 
boy who was about ten yearsold and who was very blithe and chirky and
 
they played ball and they did around together a little bit/  And the
 
/
4
 
And the little boy had learned to speak English because mady American
 
ships had come in and out ik of that particular small town.  Well one
 
day the little boy said that he knew how to write English, and my brother-
in-law said, Oh, that's t real nice±; show me how you can write Engiis ;
 
I
'd like to see you.  And he said, I know how to write a wholeEnglish
 
word.
 And so my brotherinlaw gave him a piece of paper and a pencil--
you have to see this (writing SHIP on board from right to left)
 
So now he knew exactly how to write English -
-
 backward.
 
Since he was brought up in a near Eastern culture itnever occurred to
 
him that it might be possible to write from left to w right because
 
everybody knew that you write from right to left.
 Okay?  So this
 
was a perfectly reasonable thing for him to do, and if you notice, be
 
came out with a perfectly reasonable Englis  word.  On the other hand,
 
if he didn't eventually learn that English is constructed to be read
 
from left to right, it would be very difficult for him to get very mueb
 
furhter.
 So here again we're up against a process as opposed to a product.
 
The pro
-duct in this case is a perfectly reasonable English word; the
 
process was exactly reversed, and although you can move into a situation,
 
until you undetstand k t how it operates below the surface, you will male
 
very great -
-
 you're in great danger of making misjudgements.
 So that
 
the crucial thing is to understand, then, in this case the degree Mi
 
to which it was built in to this little boy that you go from right to
 
left and the degree to which it is built into you that you go from left
 
to right.  And as soon as you understand this, then you can communicate
 
just fine.  Eut if my brotherinlaw h
d t seen it in operatio;, his
 
ethnocentrism and the little boy's ethnocentrism would have kept them
 
apart xxi in this dimension of behavior for a very long t
ime.
 
So it's not that you have to shift over, iou see.
 
I
,
-
not that I have to k learn to write the other way around, I have to know
 
that  t
' s possible to write the other way around and take that into
 
consideration when I
'm teaching or working with somebody or interacting
 
with somebody whose culture   
 
tells them to do it the other
 
way.
 Does that make sense to you?  You can't get rid of it but the more
 
you understand it the more you can use it in making sensible and important
 
communication possible.
 So that though it may seem to you to sit in
 
a classroom here and think about musical systems here that are a long way
 
from us and that we don't have very much in common with, the more we under-
stand how they work and the more we understand how our system works, the
 
more possible it will be to understand and use these systems in some
 
kind of way
 
Iow Dr. Kolinski was very aware of this pas problem.
 He did
 
his work back in the twenties and thirties and it is interesting that in
 
this same little paragrpah -
-
 he just made this distinction ± a* in a
 
paragraph of a particular article I was reading, for all I know it had
 
been made before -
-
 but he said, it is possible that ethnocentrism tk
 
may not be totally disfunctional , that we may be able to use it.
 He
 
said it's very difficult to see your own music as clearly as you see
 
other peoples' because you have subjective reactions to it and you assume
 
that's the way music is going to be anyway.  And he said I can foresee
 
the day when we will have African
 n and Eastern  and Indian scholars
 
studying western music in teams, just as we send out teams from Europe
 
study African and Indian and Asian systems.
 Which was kind of an ad-
nced concept for his particular time writing1 in the ninetwen twenties.
 
_
,his has indeed begun to be the case; our musical systems are being
 
studied by people from other parts of the world,  just as we send out
 
a team of ethnomusicologists to Africa.  And kkm I
'd like to take it
 
step further.
 It seems to me that at after a while you can get to have
 
on-cuit rol nn  extra-cultural teams, so tho
 the
 sifht th
 
- 
6
 
from being inside can be joined with the insights that people have from
 
seeing from the outside.
 2
1n1 then we may begin to  et somewhere closer
 
t
o what really is going on.
 
Now he then went on to talk a little bit about the analytic
 
system in which you listen to and transcribe the music, pulling out the
 
significant characterizwrs  and lumping them together.  Now if I gave you
 
the notion yesterday ± that I don't think the analytic system is any good,
 
that was inadvertent on my part.
 I think the analytic system is absolutely
 
necessary and xx I completely agree with K linski that both must be used
 
all the time.  But he also added a characteristic point, because he was a
 
very sophisticated man,
) and he said you have to realize that the synthetic
 
approach underlies the analytic.  You can't get away
 
in effect.  Your reactions to the music are going to
 
you want to analyse, and then you can bring out your
 
but you've already made a subjective decision -
-
 I
'm
 
as opposed to analyzing that.
 So that in a way it's
 
both of them at the same time.
 
Now
 
from ethnocentrism
 
tellyou what it is
 
sophisticated machine,
 
going to analyse this
 
inevitable to use
 
what I wanted to stress t
o you in this discussion is that
 
the synthetic method is useful( some anthropologists feel that it is not,
, 
And that we will use it for this semester along with that part of the
 
analytic method that we can use without resorting to transcriptions and
 
fancy machinery because we don't have the physical possbility of doing
 
that.
 So we will not ourselves beix learning how to use the various
 
tpes of transcription machinery, but we'll try to talk from time to tine
 
about what they can tell you and and what they can't tell you, so
 
you can decide for
 
Now,
 
cept of what music
 
youselves if they're worth the bother.
 
we are thus going to begin to work within ourown con-
is, and I'd like to start with a little experiment
 
which will be designed to show you some of the strengths and some of the
 
weaknesses of the synthetic method.
 The fact is that we are al
l able to
 
*
 
make judgments  about music very quickly.
 If you think to yourself
 
the last time you were driving down the freeway at 79 mile,­
, an }our  r
i
o
 
decided to switch on the radio, and when the music came on witnin 1robobiy
 
ten seconds you were able to say to yourself, yep, that's hard rock a
l,(
-
turn to another station or yuch that's hillbilly and turn to another
 
station or gee that's a nice song, that's the kind of music I like -
-
whether you had ever heard the individual pieceof music or not, you
 
were still able to locate it stylistically.
 
And you were able to locate this with a great deal of
 
accuracy without ever having heard of it  before.  And I would like to
 
indicate to you the degree to which you can make this kind of judgme
 
Already, you see, you've heard a lot of music.  Now most of us can gove
 
a kind of working guess as to -
-
 we might be confused a couple of times —
 
but we can make a reasonable guess as to what part of the world a piece
 
of music comes from if we heard it.
 might be wrong, but we'd pro-
bably be within the range of possibility.  And I
'm going to play you
 
now six pieces of music -
-
 because I don't like to talk too long in thes
 
class, there's too much music to listen to -
-
 and have you write down
 
a very quick description of the music (
this is just for yourself, by
 
the way; you'll have to get used in this course to taking lots of twat
 
t
ests.  None of them count.
 They are just for your amusement; you see
 
if we run through a bunch of music and then somebody says, well what about
 
that second tune, you need to have something to check back with.
 O
 
write this down for yourself; it won't be handed in/, but I
'd like you
.
 
to have it there so that you can refer back."
 
This music comes from various points on the eartki'c ssrfa
 
and I am going to play you six different pieces; I
'd like you to describe
 
this just very ropidly, enough so that you can remember what the song was
 
like anu we can talk about it later, and then give a reasonable educateo
 
guess as to where it comes from.  Which may or may not be ma accurate,
 
,
:,r
i

 Nothin  that happens in this room
 
is held against you by the way.

(After various discussion trying to locate various pieces.)  Actually,
 
your perceptions are extremely accurate.  The geography is completely
 
wron , but the perceptions are accurate.  How can we explain this?
 
deli, as a matter of fact, all of these were recorded in Italy; every
 
sirrle one of them is a piece of Italian folk music.
 
Now what's the point I
'm getting at here?  Not to cnvince
 
you that you don't know anything.  No, because this is part of a very
 
interesting cultural study and is one of the major points that I
'm
 
trying to make for you here.
 If you had played this, I predict, to a
 
bunch of Italians, they would have told you the same thing.  They would
 
have had exactly the same kinds of perceptions that you had because in
 
effect wx what has happened in Italy has happened here in the U.S. and
 
that is that one style has been selected out as the style and that was
 
the first one I played you -
-
 that kind af that most of you t associated
 
immediately with Italy (
singing dum de dum tarantella rhythm)  That's
 
the style that centers around Naples (
?) and is an urban style.
 And in
 
effect it has drowned out -
-
 because it's become the national music
 
system
 all of the other local styles.  But the fact is -
-
 and this
 
v ry important for you to remember -
-
 nations don't make music.
 It's
 
0
 
0
 
bunches of people that make music and they may or may not correspond
 
So
 
to a nation, in most cases they don't.  Am that all national music±s
 
are made up of levels of local traditions that reflect the history and
 
tne independent experience of different peoples within that politic
 
G
 
1
1,
 we call a nation -
-
 which does not necessarily have L  °°
 
history for all the  different people who live there.
 And what you
 
were recognizing there was the fact that Italy, like most other con-
temporaty nations, had had a number of different peoples come into it
 
at different times from northern Africa, from the near zE East, from
 
northern Europe.  They have had a lot of different kinds of human beinys
 
livind there, and their traditions are still being maintained.  As soon
 
as you wipe out the top cultural overlay pf what the nation is supposed
 
to sound like, and listen to what it actually does sound like, from one
 
small community to the next.  Now Italy is a very ancient country and
 
therefore it has lived through a number of groups of different human
 
beindo moving into it, so that you were simultaneously right, as we l
l
 
sO  wron , because what you were hearing was the cultural diversity
 
that exists ±
 x within this cart of the world that we call ItaIxy.
 
(
tape ran out)

L.
 
And it wouldn't have/mattered if I had done this the other way round. If I had
 
framed this for you/in Italy, you would have wound up saying,  '
Gee there's a
 
lot of different kinds of human beings in Italy".
 
So remember when you come to do your ethnography -
-
 to be sure to fit your
 
ethnographic research with the particular music you are listening toe; because
 
the music goes together with a particular group with their special cultural
 
history and their special way of life.

 Cu

'
lture to try to get what we refer to as "pure" tone, which means the cjccnc
 
ssible approximation to a single pitch, without any noise factors coming I
n.
 
,is is one reason we have so many electronic instruments -

 a search for
 
o
re tone.  But I have a feeling that when we get it, we
 don't like

re  nat first wnoii  on to the strings which certainly, is not pure tone
 
by any means; it's got a lot of scrape,
 
somrnitment that goes into making a tone.
 
Let me tell you about the African p

(Diagrams on board).
 The mbira, having sounders made c

All right.
 Now,
 having deteri.ined the distinction between

purely mathematically, you mix could have theoretically an inf LItc

 If you started with a fr?euenc:

of one and moved up one or a fraction at a

finite number.
 Now this is limited, practically speaking,by what
 
audible to the human ear; things too low cannot be picked up by o
 
ears and things too high cannot be heard.
 (Dog whistles are inaddibic
 
to the human ear because their frequencies are too high, but dogs
 
them up right away;  this is why your dog howls when a siren goes by.
 
Other factors also limit the number
 
a note, will the men in the room hum it too?
 
the same note?
 (Student replies: No, it is an octave lower.)
 But
 
is sort of the sare note, isn't it?  Well, we have now discovered on
 
principle that all cultures understand, and that is the principle o
f
 
social unison, which I think is a very nice name for this c

I think it is important to understand the basic idea.
 If you have
 
string and you stretch it and whing it with your finger, it will produce t
in,_
 
same effect as the vibrating vocal chords, or as a column of air in a tru
 
or a stretched membEane: it will vibrate a givennumber of times per secon(.
 
Now the string vibrates in an arc that goes from end to end liho
 ot (
 
board diagram).
 But when we come to take pictures of this, wh H
 
now do with oscilloscopes and other devices, we discover that strin
j
:
o
t
 
just vibrate from end to end, and neither do columns of air in cokc  tcttles
 
or garden hoses or tr u
mpets or whatever you want to put your column of air
 
through.  They also vibrate in halves like that (board diagram).
 It is as
 
thoug h there is a center nodal point and then  he vibrations are coming at
 
each end separately.  And when you divide a string in half, :
roub oc
 
twice the amount o  tens.or on it, so +

stringed instrument.  And I divide the string exactly half way up it, not
 
pressinc, the string down,  just damping it.
 Now the full length string soon
 
like this; when I divide it there is your octave interval.
 If I divided it

 One thing that you ca t

oe ens in te rm s of sound when I pound on a table,
 
first established that its pitch was very vague,but in a general kind of
 
I think everybody will agree that it is a lowish pitch, not a very high one.
 
So we are making a kind of synthetic estimate as to the fact that this sour
,.
 
(thump) is somewhere in the low range of pitches, but it has so r

Good.  These are all qualitative reriarks, aren't they?  Ih

use for this because it is a very critical and crucial problem.  Again td c
 
to do with the same problem:  the degree of noise and the degree of amp],
 
c
ation of partials or overtones.
 If you are thinking about someone's
 
saking voice, for instance, if I were talking to you like this, you would
 
I have a pretty gravelly voice in coin; on parlance, or rasp, if you want

overtones coming at you, wouldn't I?  Most teachers cultivate a P
 cree
 
of high overtones because they carry farther than low ones, and if
 
to be heard at the end of the roan without speaking loudly (forcing
 
volume) you put your voice into your head and you give out with a good
 
of highness which comes out of the nasal vibrations in the nasal cavitie:
 
p here.
 I was first aware of this when my kids were small, and I woul:- r (  
school and tell them to pick up their clothes or something,
 
say, stop using your teaching voice.  Because nohod
 r
 
ke this, including you, by the way.
 
'
in doing here is trying to demonstr

lities that you respond to all the time in the speaking syste
 
e musical system.  And all of us know in effect that these
 
hen my voice is really gravelly, it sounds like I

and when my voice gets ver:

oo many high overtones to make it a pleasant warm kind of sound.  You ou;H t

pull up to a red light, I always see people yakking away to themselves and
 
singing - -  very good for them.  Anyway, use the time to try some experiment ;
 
try talking way down here or throwing your voice up in

So what we're touching on here is tonal quality,

this is bang, and all of these words have a good deal of emotional

contexts.  And of course you're right, because in western culture, very
 
few people play the table as their standard musical instr

peoples play things very much like it, because they like this kind of sou

Okay, there is another dimension.
 (THUMP)  Wow; right.  There ic
 
the question of loudness, the amplitude of the sound waves, usually

make all the time.  Every once in a while people look at me as thou

But I can say it;  so can you.  And the surorisinn thing is that we would h

 LECTURE # 5
 (
Monday, February 26)
 
When we were chatting after class last t
i me ,
 Mr. Truex pointed out a
 
very good example of the kind of specialized job that the human ear does
 
but that no machine can do. He pointed out that if you have ever been at a
 
large party--say, a cocktail party, or a reception or something, where t
here
 
are lots and lots of people and lots and lots of conversations going on at
 
the s
ame moment--you can hear your own name through all of the babble. That I
S,
 
if somebody starts to talk about you, or if somebody says "Hello, Joe" from t
he
 
other side of the room, you will hear the '
Joe' which you filter out of all the
 
other vocal input that you're getting and know that that is a signal for you to
 
respond to. The same thing happens if you drop a dime or a penny on a busy-
street corner; people hear that noise because it is a significant noise, and it
 
is louder to you than other noises which can be, from the point of view of vol-
tage (
or how it would register on a voltmeter), much louder.
 
So the human ear does a tremendous amount of peculiar sorts of screening
 
that we don't really understand yet; the results, then, that are obtained by
 
the human ear, are qualitatively different from those that can be obtained by
 
putting music through any of the kinds of machines that we have developed. We are
 
still in the process of trying to understand exactly how this works, but clearly
 
culture comes into this pretty strongly.
 
Culture, then, deterrr
:ines what we will hear; your name i
s an important sig-
nal, and the dropping of money is a very important signal, in terms of our cul-
ture, A Trobriand Islander, transported to New York, might not distinguish the
 
significant ring of the penny on the pavement, in the way thatpeop e in the
 
United States would becuase we know how important a signal that is.
 
Mhat this amounts to is a plea, on my part, that you realize the intricate
 
and important job that your own ears are doing for you all the time; and that you
 
not feel that they are untrustworhty instruments. They are much more subtle, much
 
more sophisticated, much more .
.. give you an awful lot more graded-out and sorted-
out information than you can get from the most sophisticated of the various kinds
 
of hardware. The hardware will help you find out what It 18 you're hearing---
and again, I
'm not trying to put it down; I
'm just trying to build you up, in
 
the other dimension, because I think that most people feel there is something
 
so subjective and personal about hearing that they can't really trust them-
selves.
 
There are a few other things I want to discuss before we really get down to
 
the muttons and begin to u
se these ears (that I am hoping you will begin to value
 
so greatly) by actually listening to some music and seeing what happens to us.
 
But there are a few questions that I think we have to touch on before we can be-
gin on that end of it.
 
The first one is one that people u
sually bring up--not exoecting very much
 
of an answer (
and they don't usually get one) but it's ceremonial to discuss its
 
that is '
how did music begin?'. Obviously, nobody knows how music began; it has
 
been around as long as there have been human beings. Anything that can be said
 
about it is totally speculative, and totally tentative. It quite probably, or
 
possibly, may have stemmed from the kind of impulse that Edmund Leach talks
 
about in '
Rethinking Anthropology'--there are two little essays at the end of
 
that book that I would recommend to anybody that's interested in human behavior.
 
This impulse, that he feels is very fundamental to human beings, is a need to
 
organize and mark out time; a need to distinguish time as it flaws past u
s; a
 
ad to make some kind of markers that we can return to or recognize; a need to
 
.
.
Ike some parts of time different from other parts of time. You See, human beings
 
won't let anything go uncontrolled, if we can help it. We will take all of our
 
experience and try to shape it, so that we can then start doing something with it,
 
or about it, or to it, or by it, or out of it, or something. We really are the
 
most manipulative creature that was ever invented; we dislike things that we can't
 
control, and obviously time is something that we cannot control —it's going to
 
go on; but we can handle it in terms of segmenting it out (we can mark off days,
 
and nights, and years, and moments, and so on). And music, you see for the forty-
fourth time (
and I
'll probably say it 2
,000 times before the end of the semester),
 
exists in t
ime, unlike s
culpture or painting .
 You  have  to  deal wi t
h the dl-
mension of time when you are dealing with music; it i
s a sequence of events
 
t
hat i
s involved in music. Music, it seems to me, must have had something
 
v
ery fundamentally to do with the attempt to sort of mark o
ff o
r specialize
 
or to come to grips with the concept of t
ime.
 
Behaviorly speaking, instead of, so to say, philosoDhically, what did
 
music possibly s
tem from? What kinds of behavior that man has could it have
 
emerged from? This again, I think, could be put on a sort of a double layer.
 
We carry around inside u
s a r
emarkably flexible, s
ensitive, a
nd expressive
 
instrument that i
s the hu
man voice; and there are a number of people who feel,
 
for this r
eason (
physiologically speaking), vocal music must have preceded any
 
kind of instrumental  t
hing. On the other hand, I don't know i
f you can really say
 
that, becuase we also carry around with u
s arms, l
egs, and the physical, external
 
structure that enables us to interact with the environment, and t
hat enables u
s
 
to make things vibrate, and make things happen, by the impact of our actions on
 
the environment around u
s. It i
s perfectly possible--I mean, your archaeologist
 
and your physical anthropologist can t
ell you that various kinds of flints were
 
chipped so as to make knives (
and I suspect they were) but we h
ave no evidence
 
t
hat early man d
idn't bang t
hem together to make clicking sounds with them too,
 
as far as that goes —they might just as well have. They might have even started
 
by c
licking them t
ogether to make a sound, and then discovered that that made some
 
of them chip o
ff. Who knows? There's absolutely no way to tell whether some of
 
t
hese t
hings t
hat
. we dig u
p out of the early l
ayers of deposit's were instruments,
 
-
hat they were.
 
t
ook a course —a l
ittle sort of run through, a r
emedial course for anthro-
poI:Di s
ts who had been out of s
chool too long —in archaeology, and the archaeolo-
gist involved said that whenever an archaeologist d
idn't know what an object was,
 
he called it a '
ceremonial object'. Well, that appeals to
 very strongly; I sus-
pect t
hat a lot of these ceremonial objects m
ay possibly have b
een musical instru-
ments —they may possibly have simply been just objects; who knows? There's no
 
way to t
ell. Because both man's ability to voacalize and man's ability to
 
impinge upon his environment are tremendously bound up with our
, physiology,
 
and there is simply no way of telling which one went first. They quite possibly
 
even evolved together--and this seems to me most likely. If you enjoy this kind
 
of speculation, you can enjoy thinking about how instruments may have developed
 
over time. Dr. Kroeber, for example, presented a kind of gassy theory that it i
s
 
very possible that the hunting bow was develo ed\as a musical instrument because
 
you can twang the string and you can make different kinds of sounds on it before
  
anybody though of u
sing it to impel an  arrow. Normally, we tend to think of nn
 
the ot}er way around, but musical evidence indicates that maybe we have been in-
te:
tested in getting along with each other just as long as we have been interested
 
in how to kill each other.
 
You can safely assume that the musical system extending out from this prob-
ably has some relationship with other types of behavior that man engages in: on
 
t
he level of vocal behavior, that probably the voice has something to do with
 
l
anguage or speech, because they are using very much of the same kinds of dimen-
i s
; and that instrumental developement has something to do with physical acti-
.
 
of some type or another—body activity, body movement. But that's about as
 
r as it's fairly safe to go, I think, in this whole area.
 
t it again points up the fact that we are dealing here, in a behavioral
 
sense, with music as an extension of, or as someh o
w or another connected with,
 
other thingethat man does.
 
Dealing first a little bit--and I do not want to spend too much time on this
 
ca u
se I want to get on to other sorts of things; I
'll be sort of hitting a few
 
-- f you think about the d
istinction between speech and singing, it be-
ry difficult to tell exactly where one begins and the other leaves
 
off. I learnd this, for instance, from a lady in the South: (
Sings Juba). Now, i
s
 
that a song, or a chant, or a verse, or speech...or what is it? If you feel that
 
it is both .
.. I have a tendancy to feel that it's both, when I do it myself; at the
 
I am speaking, and then I am using more exaggerated speech style, and
 
it gradually kind of turns into singing as it goes along. I can feel t
he
 
two ends of it: I feel that I start with speech and I end with singing, but
 
I
'm not sure exactly how that transition goes, even t
hough I can do it myself.
 
It took me a long time to l
earn how, by the way, which is why I
'm u
sing just this
 
one example. It's not very easy to do; you have to kind of practice it, if i
t's
 
not part of your normal way of doing things. (
It's not, for me; I usually either
 
sing or I talk, but going in between the two is something else, for me g)
 
The way this feels to me internally is that I am exaggerating speech acts
 
until it finally becomes music. But whether t
here is a qualitative point at which
 
this happens, or whether it i
s a gradual extension of t
1e same thing, T
'm not
 
really sure.
 
(Student asks: I
s it an exaggeration of the words or of the rhythm?) It s not
 
either, actually. This Is, by t
he way, a very typical way to think of what hap-
pens there--to think of it in t
erms of rhythm and in t
erms of words. But what
 
was j
oing on there w as  not r
ny...I was saying t
he poem, I t
hink, as rhythmically
 
as I sang it at the end. So that it wasn't rhythm that was involved, although
 
when you repeat something like a poem, you are putting in the rhythmic dimension,
 
to begin with, that you do not ordinarily have in your ordinary speech, or flow
 
of speech. That distinguishes, in a way, poetry from conversati,n---or is one of
 
the distinguishing things; there are undoubtedly billions of them.
 
What I think I
 was doing was exaggerating the ups and the downs of my speech--
slightly--and then gradually turning these into perceptible pitches by eliminating
 
a little noise from my voice and hitting in more definitely on the pitches; that
 
i
s, replicating pitches, repeating pitches, instead of letting the voice just go
 
or l
ess uppish and more or less downish, which is what we do when we speak.
 
If this is the case, then one can postulate that when singing happens, as
 
opposed to speaking, we are stylizing a speach act and repeating pitches, and
 
making them r
aore definite. At the same time we are making the normal speech
 
rhythms a little bit more regular, because poetry, t
hen, leads into song. If you
 
want to get into a really complic ted argument, try and distinguish whether
 
poetry came first or s
inging came first. There are a lot of people who just
 
love to think about that; I find it absolutely impossible, and I have not
 
even 
.
.. these Early-days speculations don't really turn me on very much. But
 
a lot of people are very fond of them, so enjoy yourself. This i
s the course you
 
can do it In, if you want to.
 
It seems to me that there are two things that have happened, at l
east o
ily
 
two that I can pull out and be very sure about. One of them i
s '
Increased amount
  
of repetition, or redundancy' —that is, I
'm hitting the same pitches over and
 
over again, and I
'm regularizing the rhythm so that I have a rhythmic pattern
 
that is repeated over and over again. In the second place, I am exaggerating 
the dimensions of speech, and formalizing them. (
These are just suggestions that
 
I
'm throwing out to you to see how useful you would find them in trying to make
 
this distinction.) But If this is the case, then we should examine a little hit
 
about the way speech happens before we get into music .
.. 
and t
hat's one of the
 
things I wanted to talk about for a few minutes this morning. I
'm not a trained
 
linguist, and what I
'll be telling you are just some very broad kinds of concepts
 
or ideas.
 
Speech is an individual act, and it i
s patterned in terms of interchange with
 
other people; that is, in a conversation, one person talks, and then another per-
son talks, and then the first person talks, and t
he other person talks, and s
o on.
 
One clearly distinguishing thing that separates speech, as used in conversation,
 
(from) speech, as used in song, is that in speech (
(as used in conversation)),
 
r
ou are essentially alone-- you are the one who is doing the communicating. Now,
 
: . Jy may interrupt you,, that is they may start to speak before you stop, but
 
n some societies, seems to go on all the time. There are some people who
 
jist like to talk to eachother constantly, and it doesn't seem to matter that they
 
are not turn-takers. '
Re aro very strong turn-takers: we like to have one thing
 
said, and then the next thing said, and we find any degree of overlap knd of
 
offensive.
 
You can notice t
his, by t
he way, in conversation )
etween c
Ufferent ethnic
 
peoples: the conversational styles, you will find, are quite different.
 
Black people, in general, do a great deal of '
unhuh-ing', and '
yeah', and--
in effect--'52nen--ing'; when they do it in musical circles, they call it
 
"bearing people up". The are constantly encouraging, by a little bit of vocal
 
input, the speaker or the singer to go ahead. Some other peoples don't do t
hat
 
at all; they wait until the individual gets through. (By the way, I pointed out
 
this business of Black speech style to a psychologist friend of mine. 7
f
le were
 
chatting after class, and he said, "You know, I wonder if this has anything to
 
do with the fact that I never can get Black patients to talk to me very much. You
 
know, I
've been psycho-analytically trained, and when you are a psychoanalyst,
 
you are trained to just sit there and be kind of blank, and let the individual
 
fantasize; we're not supposed to enter into the Interaction." He said, "I notice
 
t
hat Black people just tell me something, and it just drops; and then I
'll wait
 
i
d they'll tell me another thing .
.. but they don't really talk to n
e." I said,
 
aybe you're not g
iving them signals that it's all right for them to talk to
 
you." But he said, "How can I
? I
'm supposed to be blank." I said, "Well, I
 
don't know...but in Black society, my hunch is that, when you con't say anyti
'-ing
 
at all, the message that you are sending is:'I t
hink you're a dope, and a jerk,
 
and an idiot'. But if you just say '
unhuh' you're not really agreeing, you're
 
just saying '
Talk to me, baby; tell me some more'."
 
There are other people who feel that it i
s OK to interrupt; that is, that i's
 
all right for two people to be talking at the same time. Jacqueline Lindenfeld
 
told me one time that t
his was one of the hardest things for her to l
earn when
 
she was learning English; She said that French people talk on top of each other
 
continuously, and that it is not rude, it's that they have a lot to say, and they
 
are very combative people and they want to get in there and get in on it, and
 
so they talk constantly, overlapping. She said, "I was constantly being told,
 
when I first started to L
earn English, 'you must not interrupt this way; it's
 
very rude'--and it wasn't rude to me, at all."  he said, "I still do it, sometimes.
 
It's v
ery hard to get over that."
 
But there i
s one thing that very rarely happens, in terms of speech, which
 
in a sense, I think, signals out one of the dimensions of singing; that is that
 
we very, very rarely say the same thing at the same time in a group. Even two
 
people don't. As a matter of fact, when it happens accidently, we consider it
 
specialized enough that we have a wh le ritual to mark this---rou'know, you link
 
little fingers and say '
Needles, pins, triplets, twins, one man marries...'--
in effect, it's a whole magical ceremony  it you don't go through this, you run
 
the risk of breaking the friendship. But singing is an occasion when group
 
phonation can happen —a whole bunch of people can say the same thing at the same
 
t
ime; and this very rarely happens outside of singing--only in a few ritu l oc-
'
asions such as group prayers, for instance, where  veryone i
s r
eciting the Lord's
 
.
.
ivelant ritual utterance.
 
hing about music, then, that allows you to say the sa m
e thing
 
at the same time (notice the same effect of redundancy coming in again, becuase
 
redundancy, you are going to find out--that is, the same t
hing happening on many
 
levels--is one of the important things about music. Furthermore, this is one of
 
the reasons, I suspect, that people feel good about singing; you can sing a song
 
and bring back social memories--did you ever notice this?; this business of '
that's
 
our song' between lovers, for instance? This, in effect,means that the music itself
 
has this power of bringing back something that happened to you along with other
 
people, and you can, in effect, re-imagine for yourself what it was like, even
 
when you hear somebody just whistle the tune .
.. 
then you remember, all of the sud-
den, what it was that you courted to, etc.
 
(
Student: That kind of works two ways, because--especially now with popular
 
songs--you hear a song and you can associate it back with the time, or something
 
that was happening, or the words of the song can make something that's happened
 
to you...) That's right; any part of a song can trigger the most extraordinary
 
memories. It's oneof the magical things about music--and I think it's because of
 
this very strong group-orientation that music has; that is is involved, somehow
 
or another, with the group communicating to itself, about itself, with itself.
 
I had a strange experience in this line, one time: there was a folk fes-
tival at UCLA, and they had this introductOry concert in which everybody who
 
was going to be on the festival came out and did one t
hing. There was a very
 
broad range of people who were participating in this: there was a marvellous
 
folk t
heater from Mexico; there was a Scot's bagpipe band; there were some
 
Scandinavian folk dancers; a Black blue singer; there was a marvellous Brit-
ish ballad singer from England; it was a great big deal. And the concert was the
 
longest concert, I think, that I ever went to in my life, because everybody
 
wanted to be in on it. You see, it was t
he first, '
snple' night, and everybody
 
that cane out really put out their big number. It vas a very hot conr'ert; every-
body was doing his most spectacular thing. And it went on, and on, and on...and
 
I was sitting there making knowledgable remarks about this or that to my friends
 
and enjoying it very much--it was a great concert. It got to be about 2
:30,
 or
 
some rediculous time; I mean, this concert was a marathon, if you lasted it out.
 
A little hillbilly trio came out--a mandolin, banjo, and guitar; t
hree kind
 
of middle-aged guys with hats on (they always do in those things —big hats)--
and they came out and they sang '
Redwing', and I just about melted. Suddenly, out
 
of all this sophisticated stuff, which I had been very knowledgable about and so
 
on, man--this was r
ay songt It was just like the music I u
sed to hear when I
 was
 
a child; this was me; this was little West Texas town; it was the Light Crust
 
Dough Boys, that I used to listen to on the radio when I was about ten.
 
The thing that struck me about it is, that if I had looked down this pro-
gram--'Redwing' is really a corny song. I don't know if you know it or not, but
 
it i
s very corny; it's a fake Indian song that was popular around 1900--If I had
 
had the program in advance and had looked down to f
igure out for myself what would
 
be the high point of the concert, '
Redwing' would've come in somewheres towards
 
the end. It would never have been what I would have selected out, in advance, but
 
it was definitely what I r
eally, 100 per cent., responded to. I t
hink all of us
 
have had th:LS  kind of experience, where a f iliar tune, or a familiar style, has
 
just flooded memories back over u
s --and they are invariably social m
emories,
 
memories involving other people in some kind of way. I t
hink this has to do
 
with this potential for group phonation which exists in music (along with a
 
lot of other factors we will be going into later).
 
There have been a lot of attempts to investigate the i
nteraction, on fairly
 
specific levels, of musical systems and linguistic systems, partly brought out
 
by the obvious fact that language has rhythm (
that is, speech has rhythm); it has
 
stress, or accent (you get louder or softer); it has pitch variation; it has
 
tempo and rhythmic factors; and it has vocal qualifiers, vocal segre ates that
 
make one person's speech sound dry or raspy or telodic or whatever adjectives you
 
want to put in on it. All of these factors, as we have just observed, also per-
thin to music; so people have tried to see if there is a tie-in between the lin-
guistic system and the musical system of a particular people.
 
The results, so far, are very confusing--that's about all I can tell you
 
about that.  t
e u
sed to think it would be simpler than we think it would be now,
 
because we u
sed to think that languages could be clearly coded or divided into
 
two big groups: languages which are so-called tone languages, and languages which
 
are stress languages. But the fact is that all languages use both tone and stress
 
to illustrate meaning;
 just that some languages use more stress, and other
 
languages use more tone. Jacqueline Lindedleld was telling me, the other day, th:t
 
some people are beginning to think that they are the same thing, anyway; that you
 
cannot really distinguish stress from tone, in terms of speech, or know which is
 
the operative factor. (You see, I can go way up here (
HIGHER PITCH), and way down
 
here (LO
'VER PITCH), and I would be putting some tone In.) The distinction was
 
supposed to be that, in a tone language, variance in tone brought with it var-
ience in meaning; that is, if you said something way up here--way high in terms
 
of your vocalization--the same syllable, said quite low, would have a completely
 
different meaning. Saying it high might mean '
cucumber, and saying it low might
 
mean '
ice skates' —I mean, that much difference in meaning., 
There are languages in which that dietinction does exist. It i
s nct, how-
ever, a question of a qualified pitch; it simply means that you go up above, or
 
you go down below, from where your speech normally works. It is not a specific
  
pitch--you can say t
hat everybody has tot
-it that pitch, and that will mean '
ele-
phant', and everybody has to hit the same pitch way up high, and that will be
 
'
squash'--it is the variation from t
he median line of speaking, in t
hese  an-
guages. There are some languages that do contain this feature: a lot of l
an-
guages in West Africa do; a lot of Oriental l
anguages, also--I believe Chinese
 
does (
and this might be, by the way, why neople are apt to say that Chinese speak-
ers sound '
sing-song' .
.. 
because they are stressing pitch as they move from their
 
normal speech level). There are a lot of other languages that clearly have some
 
evidence of tone quality.
 
If you think about that for a minute, you c
an see that writing a tune, or
 
singing a tune, in a tone language would be different, if you wanted to put a
 
lot of verbal cantent into your song. You don't want your song to come out say-
ing '
elephants are r
ár favorite vegetable' because you put the tone in the wrong
 
place.
 
I think the point might be a little clearer to you, though, if I talked to
 
you a little bit about stress languages; then I can give you a little bit of
 
speculation a
s to how this musical effect in manifested. (
When a )
 language i
s
 
a so-called stress language, (we mean) that meaning can be changed by accenting
 
a word. English does this a good bit. (
Starting with) a declarative sentence, for
 
instance, if you put an up or a kind of down at the end of it, it will make a qu
e s-
tion out of it. (
Example: I
've been to the libraryVe all of the sudden sounds
 
like a question; it should sound like a declarative sentence.) So t
hat we do em-
haslze meaning by a pitch change, here, but we can also do it by means of a stress.
 
We can say: "I've been to the library" —that means, you haven't; "
I've been to the
 
i
ibrary-" —that means, I hwen't been to the grocery store; "I've been to the li-
brary to get a book"--I didn't get a newspaper, magazine, or any-t
hing else...it
 
was a book; "I've been to the library to get a book" --you may have been to other
 
places to g
et other things. All of these things shift the meaning very subtly.
 
By the way, one of the reasons that you can kind of know for yourself that
 
we have a stress language is that we have, in our printing industry,  a whole
 
method o
f indicating stress, that involves a whole lot of harclware and metallic
 
d
evelopement. We have an italics font that we use because, every once in a A
-hile,
 
the meaning o
f s
omething simply i
s not clear unless you put it in i
talics, or
 
u
nderline, as you do in y
our papers. One of the tricks of writine--if you've
 
ever t
aken an English course; at least it was so in my day —the professor would
 
t
ell you you had to r
ecast the sentence until its meaning was clear without
  
u
nderlining. A
nd they would always g
ive you bad marks if t
here was any ambiguity

 i
s a little bit easier to handle, in -v
erbal t
erms, t
han
 
pitch; you can s
ee t
hat the implications of varying stress are a little bit more
 
g
eneralized than t
he implications of varying pitch. Notice from my first example--
where I gave you a s
entence that was changed by T
)itch--that Fnglish does have pitch
 
v
ariation, meaningful pitch variation. Apparently, all l
anguages have both; s
ome
 
have more in one direction t
han in the other.
 
I
f you have a very F
�
trongly p
itch-oriented l
anguage, i
t s
eems to me, it makes
 
problem in g
etting your verbal input into song. It s
eems to me that .,
 in a lan-
guage where you are u
sing tone very importantly, you would not be able to sing
 
the same tune over again with different words as easily as you can in a s
tress
 
language. And y
ou might very well f
ind that it's easier to write one verse, and
 
oirig i
t o
ver and over again--or it might be easier to just write a long s
ong with-
out any r
epOtition I
n m
elody�-so you can throw in your intonations, and change
 
things, where you want to (
(need to to express your meaning)). There are,, indeed,
 
three different basic ways of writing tunes, a
nd I have a hunch that t
hey may be
 
connected linguistically, or affected linguistically, at !
-
east.
 
We will be g
oing into these at greater length l
ater, and y
o� will l
earn how
 
to d
istinguish between the three, but for the t
ime being .
..
 there i
s a kind of
 
song construction called Litany, in w
Jhich you take a s
hort phrase, and you s
ing
 
L
t over ..
 and over, and over, and over again. There are a lot of peoples in t
he
 
4
orld whu do t
his, and enjoy this, for a number of reasons which we will b
e
 
ex lp
lorin,
��.  T
he typical t
hing with litany i
s a one or two line phrase .,
 with t
he
 
words r
epeated over and over a
gain; some people g
et it boiled d
own all the way
 
to one word. (
student question) No, I wouldn't call it chant. T t
hink you will
 
hear a lot of litany t
hat is not like chant at all: African litany, wher  you
 
get a lot of drums going, and a lot of things going on, doesn't really sound l
ike
 
what you are referring to as '
chant'. You are reading in, I suspect, from your
 
own experience with chant, where we have a tnedancy to .
.. 
this is sort of extra-
ordinary for us; we don't write songs like this, so '
we usually put them in a
 
special catagory and cill them chants. (
Student: The music i
s repeate , or the
 
words?) Both. (
Student question) The fundamental thing to concentrate on is
 
the music (
(rather t
han the words)). Sometimes you will find litany with t
he
 
words changing, but it t
ends not to change very much; most of the time they will
 
-
;
tick with the same verbal phrase, repeated over and over again along with the
 
i
y.
 
ow, the second kind--well, it's really t
he third kind, but I
'll put it do n
 
there is a sort of intermediate kind, that 1111 get to last--is called
 
throug-composed. In through-composed, you have a song that goes on and on and on,
 
and never does repeat 
.
.. or, if it does repeat, it repeats so far along that you
 
can't remember where it was repeating to, i
f you follow me. Epic songs are this
 
way: when people actually sit down to sing an epic —as they still do in Yugo-
slavia, in parts of the Balkans, in parts of Africa--where they are going to tell
 
you the whole story of their people (
it takes them a week or so), the tune just
 
goes on and on. It goes up hero, and down there, and it is being, in a way, com-
posed as it goes along. This is one way in which a great i
aany human beings sing.
 
(
Student: I was wondering whether specific language types can be attributed
 
to either extreme?) Well, my feeling is that, if you have a very tonal language,
 
you would probably go for litany or for through-composed (
for in through-composed
 
you can make your tone go up or down to suit the pitch requirements of your words).
 
There is another kind, in the middle, and this is our style, called strophe
  
Strophe i
s a little package of a tune. Usually, our typical style is four lines
 
(Example: '
Mary Had A Little Lamb') Now, I
'm going to sing verse number two; I
'u
 
going to use the same tune but I
'm going to change the words. (
Example: second
 
verse of '
Mary Had A Little Lamb') And t
hen, I
'll add ve ;e t
hree and verse
 
four and verse five and verse six...
 
As members of a Western culture, we are very, very strophe-happy; we are so
 
strophe-happy that it is very hard for u
s to tolerate any o
ther kind of music.
 
But my suggestion to you is that I don't hink strophe could developf
t, and be
 
developed as intensively as we have here, in a language 4th pitch problems,
 
with a lot of tone quality coming into it, because you can't r
epeat t
he tune
 
and c
}jange the words as well.
 
Ihave a private theory that this is why blues tunes are so variable--almost
 
every blues-singer puts in a tremendous amount of melodic variation--and I think
 
it's because he's stuck with this strophe style but he's really thinking in terms
 
of a tonal language underneath, somewheres way back, because most West African
 
languages were tonal; I think that this gives you a flexibility in terms of think-
ing of a melody, not as a little package that i
s going to be repeated nine billion
,
 
times, but as something that can be fooled with. You can see this very clearly,
 
I think, in blues singing, in which...someti'as I think all American blues are
 
just one tune varied. It's awfully hard to find what X blues tune i
s, as compared
 
to Y blues tune. (
Student: It's all based on the same chord progressions--it's all
 
in 4
/4 time, and there's just three c
iords, and those t
hree chords come in the same
 
places.) You can make up ten billion tunes to a three-chord progression and four
 
lines; you can make u
p an indefinite number of clearly seperablq tunes. The unique
 
thing about blues singing is it's fluidity. You can't work from the harmony back-
.
aras, I really don't think, in this case. I bet you I could go home and make up,
 
x 1t  ow, ten completely distinguishable tunes that would fit with the blues pro-
Rreasion —but they would be clearly, different tunes. (
Student: Then '
why did you
 
say
- that all blues tunes sound the same to you?) I didn't say that. I said that
 
the blues melodic line is so flexible that it is very difficult to distinguish
 
that, from one blues performance to another, this guy is working from X tune and
 
that :
.uy is working from Y tune. After a long period of ti m
e, it sort of sounds
 
like they arc all pl4ying around, continuously improvising on
—maybe one,
 
maybe four...I ;
i
ontt know how many are the baseline tunes--nobody has ever
 
done this kind of analysis with blues. The total approach is quite  üfferent of
 
a blues singer, to a person who is s
inging, say, a British ballad, who wL1i r
e-
plicate that tune every single time whereas your blues singer is continuously
 
improvising.

Since we have had a fairly strenuous time of it over the last several weeks, I
 
thought I would do something today that is a little bit uasier and start discussing
 
instruments with you.
 
As I mentioned before, instruments in" an area in which people feel that we're
 
discussing something a little bit real-er, I think, than in the area of singing. There
 
i
s a physical object there--you can look at i
t, and weigh it, and measure it-- and Amer-
cans feel much happier when they are dealing with
  much more concrete objects.  e are
 
very thingy kind of people, and we like to think about things, and we like to sort
 
them, and we like to play games with them--it's very crucial to us. So when we get too
 
tired in this class I
'll go back and talk about instruments for a while, and then take
 
off into other dimensions. Everyone s
ee s to feei t
hat w
- 'mer mre about instruments
 
than about anything else.
 
And we do, I suppose. But we don't really know things about instruments any bet -
ter than we know the important things about singing or the important things about musical
 
systems as a whole. The amount of work that has been done on instruments is deceptive.
 
Now, if you think back to my very earliest lectures, I gave you
 kind -
.if build-
up to a definition of sound in terms of sound being a
ixlible moverent, and
. it o
r
 I
 t
j�t b
 
advisable to check back in your memor, to those early discussions we were having about
 
the nature of sound in order to start dealing with the problem of instruments.
 
Now there are all kinds of movements that have nothing to do with sound: I can
 
do that (
(The nature of '
that' is hard to determ ine by aadio t e-IT)) and t
here i
s
 
no t
hing happening; but if I do that (
(thump)) and my hand i
s stopped then, at the moment
 
of the transfer of energy from my arm and hand to the table, the table vibrates in terms
 
of an audible sound. So, my transferring my human energy into this object that vibrates
 
at an audible freq u
e ncy is the base-line orineinle aloiw which you should co n
sider all
 
instrument's functioning. There is energy that goes into the instrument, and the instru-
ment then vibrates producing some variety of audible sound.
 
(
(Student points out that (
(the first, silent '
that')) did produce a sound, but
 
it was one whieb was inaudible to u
s.)) ThoU's rLIit--it's not i
n the frequency range
 
that our ears can pick up.
 
So, in order to make the movement of my hand swishin  through the air audible,
 
I had to add a sound resonator (
(and, as the student pointed out, a transducer to au(4-
i
ble frequency range-NH))--and that's what instruments, in effect, are: they are things
 
which resonate, or vibrate, within an audible range.
 
Anything, then, can function as a musical instruments. And mankind has
 
sorted out —along this baseline level, anything can function that way because
 
ly everything makes some degree of sound...but some things make better sounds
 
gradually
 
practical-
than others,
 
clearer sounds, more controllable sounds, a higher degree of audible sound .
.. there are
 
all kinds of ways that you can fix up  objects that you have around you in order to pro-
duce varying kinds of reson' ting. Thus you have begun to i
solate out particular parts
 
of the physical world around us, and to say that those are musical instruments.
 
The classification, within various societies, may be vaguer than this. Harold
 
Courlander (
(?)) tells an interesting story of talking to a Southern, White storekeeper
'
 
who had a general store in some little rural town in the Deep South, and he was com-
menting on the buying habits of Blacks who came into the store. He said, "You know,
 
'
31ack people have very funny ideas about cooking things--pots, fry-pans, things like
 
that. They test them all the time to see if the iron is any good by hitting them; they
 
s
'em to feel t
hat they can tell the quality of the pots by hitting...by-t the way it
 
sounds when they hit it." Now, what the storekeeper was unaware of was thrt t
he Hiacks
 
in that community u
sed iron frying pans and so forth  s musical instruments; and they
 
were not buying an iron frying pan to cook out of, t
hey were buying a musical instrument
 
to play on, in effect. So their classification system of musical instruments included
 
a whole range of things that the storekeeper thought of in the elrssLieaLion of '
cook-
ing pots'. That's why he assumed that they t
hought that it would mu e a better not to
 
cook with by hitting it with their fingers.
 
Each culture will have its own classification of those o
bjects they consider
 
'
musical instrua nts I
.

Blacks for a number of reasons, primarily t
he elimLnation of drums--when the sl'va
's were
 
brought over from Africa, in the Northern Hemisphere they were not allowed to pl: y
 
drums, because the planters were afraid they would communicate by u
sing the drums and
 
be able to incite rebellion; also they were intending that they convert to Christianity
 
and the planters felt that the drums represented some African religious practice (
and
 
I think they were prob biy right on both levels)-- but in any event, what they did a-
bout it was to make the use of drums illegal among Blacks ., and all the ways in which
 
they could hve begun to develope drums were denied to them. So, they simply carried
 
on the drumming tradion by simply drumming on other things in the environment around
 
them; and, since pots were hollow and had a nice ring to them, that was one thinc
' thit
 
you could make into a drum. Indeed, some of the earliest descriptions we have of mus-
i
cal behaviour of Blacks under Slavery in the Northern Hemisphere  have them dancing
 
around an iron pot which i
s trned over and which they are hitting this way. The de-
scriptions of the times refer to this as some kind of a heathen idol, or something; they
 
didn't seem to be aware that the Blacks were using the pot as a drum, that the thing was
 
an instrument.
 
So when you start thinking about classifications, you have to always bear in t
he
 
back of your head that each culture has its own classification system in terms of what
 
they consider to be a 'musical instrument', and any kind of over-all classification sys-
tem is simply imposed over t
he top in order to make some kind of recognizable world or-
dering of the varieties of the possible ways in which human beings have constructed mu-
sical instrun nt8, used things to be musical instruments.
 
Each society, then, has it's own kind of informal way of considering t
hings, of
 
dividing things up. They may not be able to tell you exactly what it is, but everybody
 
has these informal systems. And a great number of cultures have tried to formalize these
 
systems--that is, make up formal classification schemes. We have a teridancy to talk a-
bout :nly one classiuic-
itio  scheme for music=l instruments, so I think i
t's important
 
to point out that the  nciert f
lh riese had a formal class i
fica don system for their musical
 
instruments; the East Indians also had a formal classification system that was worked
 
out in Antiquity 
.
.. 
And all of these classific ation systems have attempted to sort out
 
all of the objects that the culture considered to be musical instruments accordin  to
 
one kind of priticiple or another and a number of them have been tried.
 
Cne of the attmepts-- I beleiove t
he Ancien -'  i
nese  vtp  is bs i o
r t,-i
s--
has to do with the material that an instrument is nade out of, that is, wood or metal
-
or what-have-you. Other attempts have sorted out musical instruments according to the
 
human action that is involved in playing--that is, do you hit it, do you pluck  t
, do
 
you scrape it, do you blow into It, etc. A third classification is '
what i
s the reson-
ating material within the instrument and how does that work? How i
s t
he resonating mat-
erial activated?'.
 
Now obviously, none of these systems work vury well--no classification system
 
works very well. But the one that has been most generally adopted is the one that ws
 
developedduring the late 19th century and early 20th century by 7u
rt Sachs and 7ric von
 
Hornbostel. Their big publication on this was in l9lj, and it was published in Germany
 
and we have a copy of the original classification system that they worked out in the
 
library, if you can read German. (
(English translation.))
 
As far as I know this classification syst:m
 has beoome r
elatively standard around
 
the world. It has quite a number of advantages and it i
s always handy to have some way
 
of communicating cross-culturally, so people have tended--since this is a very elaborate,
 
very carefully worked-out coding system--to have switched into the Sachs-Hornbostel sys-
tem and most ethnomusicaloglst use it exclusively.
 
Within various culture areas, the system has been adapted to fit certain local
 
problems. For instance, Hugh Tracy, I believe, working in South tfrica, has expanded
 
the Sachs-Hornbostel system to fill the need for a lot of instruments t
o fit into the
 
system that Sachs and Horribostel didn't even I
ci o
w existed at the time they made their
 
classification system up. So  each area has varied it to -
i
uit their own problems, but
 
overall they have generally speaklng...I think you'll find that this i
s the standard
 
ethod being u
sed, and you can u
se I
t fr comm  in tior  with a
iy

iny  in  a
f
 
cl
assification problem in thi: ar a.
 
Now, the basic way in which the S-3 system classifies is the naute of the vibra-
t
ing thing and what you have to do to make it vibrate. Thus, they have divided their sys-
te:a into four big catagories: Ideophones, chordophones, aerophones, membr nophoneS. 
ounders--that i
s, yOU d
on't have tk)  do anything to prepar-
these to be musical instrwnents; they exist. Our table would be an ideophone; sticks t
h-It
 
you tap together, gourds with seeds inside that rattle, would be ideophones. These are
 
all things that don't require preparation or human intervention to make them capable
 
of producing sound...You have to agitate the instrument; but you don't have to prepare
 
creased d

[,L'Dr1Le instrun nts t
hey will be c
ategorized as the Sachs
 
system has it.
 
Each of these is subdivided into sub-units of considerable complexity, whLeh I
'll
 
get to in a minute. But let me re-emphasize one point about the general system: Sachs
 
,did not intend this to imply anything about the evolution of musical instruments; it's
 
purely descriptive. He was simply trying to sort them out according to easily determin-
able physical characteristics. And he doesn't mean to say that one kind of instrument
 
had to precede another kind of instrument. Sometimes it works t
his way: generally speak-
ing, we feel that ideophones come first--that is, there are cultures in the world t
hat
 
have nothing but ideophones and they seem to be base-line. But you can't extrapolate
 
from that to say the ideophones must have come first in the lonf history of man, and
 
they evolved out according to the Sachs scheme of classification. It's not true, and
 
certainly Sachs never intended this. So we think about it purely descriptively.
 
Based on this, just for the heck of it, what is a piano? .
.. 
.
A chordo'T
hone. T
hat
 
is a banjo?,..It's a chordophone with a membranophone added as a resonating unit, but
 
it is a chordophone first. You can see the oroblems. This is why you c
an't make up a
 
classification system based only on material. T
hat he is using here are two things:
 
what's vibrating here, and what's the nature of the action that is required to make the
 
thing vibrate--material is a rather weak area to go by, although some of Sachs' smaller
 
classification systems are based on the material.
 
Un:ier ideophone is a subclassification that divides i
ristru ents up accordi n
g to
 
the way they are played: are they scraped, scratched, hit, shook...? His sub-catagories
 
then are scrapers, scratchers, rattles, ta)ping sticks...this sort of thing. Incidently,
 
"
e Sachs systemuses the Dewey decimal system--expanding sets of numbers —so that you
 
look up and classify your instrument according to number. For example, 311.122 i
s
 
a mono-heterocod musical bow, with one heterocord s
tring only  It's broken down by
 
that kind of inclusive numbering system; t
hus you can very easily and quickly describe--
if you are familiar with the numbering system— any instrument that you find in any
 
part of the world according to a very quick little formula that will be recognized by
 
any ethnomusicolocist--so you don't have to go into any lengthy, complicated deseripti
-aon;
 
you can just say "This is a Sachs 1
411.3.2 ond everybody knows exactly what the instru-
ment functions as, and where it fits i
nto the system. So i
t has a lot of conveniences
 
from that point of view.
 
The chordophones--which are the strings under tension--are divided up according
 
to external features, such as the shape of the body, rather t
han subdivided according
 
to the way that they're played. The problem with chordophones, you see, is that you can
 
have exactly the same instrument which can be plucked or can be bowed, and therefore,
 
dividing it up according to how it is played doesn't help very much because the same
 
instrument within different culture areas or within the same culture area(sometir
nes
 
a bass player slaps it and sometimes he bows It)...and so you c
an't call t
hat two dif-
frent mts1c J
. instruments •
 o chordoohones are divided by features of the external
 
shape and of the instrum
ent per se (whether it has one bridge or two bridges, etc.).
 
The n
iembranophones are subdivided according to the way they're played--are the
 
hit wth the hand? are they hit with a mallet? what is the nature o
f the mallet (
becaus
 
that changes the tone considerably? i
s the membrane being l
eaned u
pon by the who i
s pl y-
ing it?...The technique of playing is the way in which the membranophones are divided.
 
The aerophones are subdivided according to t
he way in which air is made to act
 
upon the instrument--do you have a r
eed? do you blow straight into an open column of
 
air? do you blow into a closed container with the sound coming out through holes with-
out interference? do you have interference with the holes in the form of keys or do you
 
put your finger on them?..All these are principles of how the air moves through the in-
strument.
 
Obviously this is not a very neat syst m--it's just the best we've got. It's the
 
most complete, the most cross-culturally u
seful, that s
erves to identify things very
 
e1l from multiple areas around the world. And it has been worked out in sufficient
 
detail t
hat it c
overs all t
he  robleos t
hit you run into when you run across a new music-
al i
:strwi nt (
heeause  eo lo l
i;ent  hemrl1 the time). It is a simple sorting--that's
 
all it is.
 
On t
he other hand, it i
s interesting to note, parenthetically, t
hat even though
 
it is not as nice a system...I mean, it would be nice if all of the subdivis ons worked
 
the same, and then you could make the sub-subdivisions work the same and so on...even
 
though the Sachs system lacks elegance (it just functions, that's all), it does seem
 
to be saying something about human behavior because you could take the Sachs system
 
down to, say, the third level of catagories--for example, and aerophone that works with
 
a single reed and that has stopping holes for the fingers —and you can, by noting t
he
 
number of different principles of musical instrum
e nts that you find in your culture,
 
you do have a rough gage of social complexity. The more complex a society, the more
 
different principles they will have invented for making musical instrtmients...probahly,
 
also, the more they will have adopted from other cultures, because they've probably
 
been more in contact with other cultures as well.
 
So knowing the rudiments of the Sachs system does give you sone interesting in-
formation that you can correlate with cultures. You will find, in general, that your
 
most simple cultures will have only one or two types of ideophones. You can also, in a
 
way, use this as a measure of acculturation because people borrow instruments  ll the
 
time —the pygmies borrowed a number of instruments from the Bantus that lived around t
hem,
 
and they will probalby borrow more and more as greater acculturation keeps taking place.
 
But basically, pygmies don't play anthing except a leaf, as far as I know.., and they
 
do make those l
ittle reed pipes '
which are very simple in construction, the sort of begin-
ning, base-line aerophone, so they are that complex.
 
A lot of factors come into play here, by the way: portability o
f t
hings--when
 
you begin to get musical instruments you begin to get involved with "
how many musical
 
instruments do people really want to have .
.. 
people who wander all the time don't want
 
to have to haul all that stuff with them. Pygmies are described by Coh n Turnbull as
 
making a little grass flute arrungement, ol'ytng it for fifteen :n'tes or so, and  hen

times, of course, you get orchestras where there's no s
inging, and t
he entire musical
 
message is carried by the orchestra
—but that's a very specialized thing when it hap-
doesn't happen in all societies.
 
Overall, looking at the world, you can talk in terms of numbers of instruments--
y. c o.
, count; you can take censuses. In terms of each culture, you are g
oing to find
 
special variations according to the environment, according to all kinds of particular
 
factors that affect that particular society as a se erate,individual societr.
 
I think we'd better listen to some instruments, from time to time. It's always
 
a good idea to come down and hear a few things.
 
(
(Student asks whether Tracey added any new major cata
rics..,))  a
, he added
 
subcatagories and he added new instruments, which put in new numbers, but he J
id not
 
have to add any new catagories on prin iples. There are relatively few ways that instru-
ments are made • Even going down to the third level in the Sachs catagorizing system,
 
with all of the instruments in the world you can only dredge up about fifty specific
 
types in which there really is a sort of new organizing principle. Then you get into
 
sort of irrelevent questions of "how many holes in the flute?" or "what's the spacing
 
between here and there?", "are the bridges made out of ivory or are they made out of
 
wood?"...
 
(
(STUDENT: Has anyone ever tried to do it on what they sound like?)) No, at least
 
not to my knowledge. It would be very difficult to do, don't you think, because they
 
sound so different depending on how they're played. (
(STUDENT: That  it seems to me,
 
would be the point .
.. I remember being very surprised to find o
at that for some reason
 
pianos were referred to as '
percussion'--it hadn't occurred to me at that point; 2
nd
 
as I think back on it, it really doesn't seem l
ike a  ercussion instrument....T re-
member how startling it was to find out, and it seems to me that these sorts of sys-
tems don't capture the way in which we hear instruments.)) I agree; it is perfectly
 
true: they don't at all. They r
eflect the way in which an in tr
 wsent is handiest to
 
be put into a muse r
n
.
 
(
(STUDENT: How can that really r
eflect on a culture and the way t
Tey
 make teir
 
music?)) It can't. And all the Sachs system is good f
or i
s sorting; it does apparently
 
say something, but it does not deal with this variable. I do think that "how they sound"
 
would be very difficult to u
se as an organizing principle. Put I do t
hink th't
. t
hat L
s
 
the important thing.
 
If you take a violin, you see...you think about a violin being pl yed by Yahudi
 
Menuhin, and you think about the s
ame instrument being played by a Kentucky fiddler. T
t
 
is the same instrument, and you could see why a guy in a museum would want to put them
 
together. I mean, it is a fiddle: you can measure this here and t
hat there, etc .
.. 
how
 
can you describe that difference in sound between the same instrument used in two com-
pletely different cultural areas.?
 
(
(Student asks where bells and xylophones fit in?)) They are id
oophones. They
 
are shaped, but then bo are uost ideu hones shaped, in a sense. Tapping sticks am
-
frequently shaped by the people who are doing the tapping, because they want a diffe ent
 
quality of sound or tone. Basi'ally speaking, bells and xylophones are pieces of metal
 
.
t, themselves, do sound. Now, you organize them to produce different kinds of soands,
 
i
ut the fundamental m
aterial is up here (
(tapping on board)).  (By the way, the sub-cata-
goryr for that is I
metalophonel, if you're interested--you can get r
eally fancy with this;
 
some of the narr s are really a kick.)
 
(

That was from the Phillipines .

rher were stanning, hand-clappin ,  and u
sing a chordophone. So yu - have two ideo-
phones and one chordo hone being u
sed together in an orch stra,and you could he ar
 
how well they were connected together. The heel-stamping was clearly following along
 
with the guitar, and was part of the orchestra, in a sense. (
Sachs refers to these
 
sorts of things as '
tap-dancing',

he  r
n
erican point of

.. 
but it's the same t
hing).
 
(
(STU
NT: Could hand-clapping be considered as a membr nophone?)) That's in-
geniousi I really don't see why not--it's traditional, under the Sachs system, to c
all
 
it an ideophone, but honest-to-goodness I don't see why it couldn't be called a mem-
branophone.
 
(
(RE 
coIu))
 
That i
s from the Cameroons, and they were clapping.
 
Now I think a lot of times you would feel like there was s
 omethin  else going
 
on in that kind of a sound. But a lot of people clap very d
eep, and you can vary the
 
range of clapping quite a lot (
(demonstrating)). An awful lot of these are very difficult
 
to tell by ear alone, and this i
s where you depend on your ethnographer to tell you what's
 
happening because sometimes the sound is very difficult to sort out...again it would he
 
mostly to t
he ideophone side, in terns of your own aural impression.

(
(Begins with account of Earl Collin's visit to class on Monday))
 
I did have a chat with him afterwards and he told me something that I hadn't
 
heard before: and that was that when he was a little boy in Sha mee, Oklahoma, that
 
the local Indians there got fond of him because he was playing for square dar es around
 
there, and they would go and get him and drive him to their meeting hail where he would
 
play square dances for them (when he was around 8
 or 9
 or 10). They r
eciprocated by
 
inviting him to their dances--their tribal dances--and he said he g
ot so he could dance
 
pretty good Indian for a while there. He described the dances to me in some detail
 
and the instrumentation and so on 
.
.. I
'm sorry I didn't kno-r about it at that time, be-
cause it would have been nice for him to talk to you about what he saw at that period.
 
But apparently they were still doing traditional round dancing, as he saw it. He said
 
there was a drum in the middle and everyone wore jinglers of some variety on their ankles
 
and rattles of some kind, and that the dancing went on all night--whereas the square-
dances always had to stop at twelve because they w e
re always on Saturday night and the
 
Protestant mores of the community wouldn't allow dances beyond that point; so he couldn't
 
play--h s mother would insist he stop at midnight, although the Indians were prepared
 
to go on.
 
He said that the first time he went he vas kind of scared, because they came t
o
 
get him in a car and he wasn't u
sed to riding in a car, and they took him way out t
o
 
wherever it was...he was just a little boy. But he said they were very nice, and he playua
 
for them for many years until he left there.
 
So, he has had his own cross-cultural experiences  also, ancl one of the reasons
 
at I waited particularly for him to come was to give you another demonstration of th-
k
mver of sub-cultural units that exist within this crazy society of ours. There are
 
on awful lot of them, and it is very, very easy to not notice that they exist. I t
hink
 
that this i
s especially true of Los Angeles, where we move around all the time in
 
hermetically sealed boxes; the result i
s that we never s
ee that there are people around.
 
iui sore that there are people in his community who have no idea--probably even on his
 
block--that there i
s a very fine fiddle player from his section. . .
but his life-style i
s
 
very auch the sae kind of life style thab it would have been U he were still I
i
 
in Oklahoma--that is, he sees people from the same part of t
ho country; he moves among
 
them; he always goes and has Sunday dinner with some friends of his from the displaced
 
Southwestern community t
hat moved out about the same time that he did, in the 1930's,
 
during the Dust Bowl era; and he carries on the same quality of life, and the same in-
teractions, that he would if he had stayed on in Oklahoma, I suspect.
 
nobody knows he's there. It's like Ralph E1]ison's book, The Invisibic has; there arc
 
all these groups that you live among that are essentially invisible. You don't know t
ba
 
they are there. I think it's tremendously important for those of you who are going out
 
into the community to teach or do recreation work or social work or, heck, to run a
 
filling station, t
o s
ensitize yourself to the fact of the presence of various sorts of
 
groups.
 
I went down, one time, to '
,
ell Garden, to advise on a music program, and I drove
 
down the main street of Bell Garden and I didn't even have to get out of t
he car to real-
ize that this was, baseline, a Southern, Oakie-Arkie kind of com.unity. And when I men-
tioned this to the teachers they had obviously never even thought about thisi I don't
 
know what they do with their time, but you could tell by the names of the bars, by the
 
signs saying who was going to appear there...If I
'd wanted to get out and g
o into a music
 
ore I would have found even stronger evidence: what are t
he r
ecords that are on big
 
splay there...? And another town over, another subdivision over, we would have beer
 
an area where there would have been, say, Black music featured--and I wouldn't even
 
have to look at t
he people aalking do w
n the street to know this, that this i
s what's
 
going on there.
 
The teachers in this community were not only not aware of this, but t
hey weren' b
 
even interested. T
hat they wanted me to tell them was how they could make these children
 
into good consumers of Western classical tradition; my notion of starting with the music
 
that the children already knew and working out from there met with abosolute, total re-
j
ection.
 
Pc lb's not just our Chicano population and our Black population t
hat are getting
 
s
cushed by this kind of massive system, but all the local .
.. 
the Lith u
anian Society, and
 
t
he old-time fiddlers, and the T lish-dmeric.ne, and all t
he different hinds o
f gr upo
 
t-at move across our country--all with regional identifications that are very strong.
 
igain, they are not knovm to be there...and when people know that they are there, then
 
t
hey just become a problem, not an advantage.
 
Barbara Lapan...asked (
the Old-time Fiddler s association) what their long-range
 
goals were for preserving the music, what would they like to do., .w
hat did they enjoy
 
doing the most .
.. 
what did they hope to do? And they all looked at her and
. said "we all '
d
 
111cc  to go around to the schools and play for all the children". And it seems to me i
t s
 
Just a crying shame that they're not already doing it; I mean, wouldn't i
t be nice t
o
 
have a gentleman like Earl Collins come in and play some pretty fiddle music for the
 
c
hildren and talk to them about how it was when he was coming alon;.
 
They were exactly right, too, culturally speaking. This i
s where the action i
s.
 
This is where they ought to be putting their weight. Now the question of how to finagle
 
this through the Board of Education at Bell Garden is another problem —I got absolutely
 
nowhere when I was down there. It will start on a Thcal school basis--maybe we can crack
 
i
t's a problem that Barbara's working on--and it's the kind of proj-
l
e one of you could do in your own co
unities.It requires just de-
c
.aiing to do it and going ahead and doing it —it doesn't have to be old-time fiddlers,
 
it's whoever is there; they get to get in on the action too.
 
If there is one thing that I would like to do in terms of this course (
and in
 
fact, in terms of practically all the teaching I do here) it is to get you to realize
 
that you're in charge, in effect  and that each one of u
s can contribute or we can
 
just lie down in front of the juggernaut...we have those two alternatives possible.
 
We can let the cultural variety of this country and the world be steam-rollered out of
 
éxistance, or we start doing things on a level of the community-- ithin the community
 
we're in--and the two places to focus on, fellows, are the schools and the communications
 
system, cause that's where you push some weight. I
'm not saying that politics isn
't, 
a very important area too, but the schools are a very sensitive area a
id the communi-
cations system is a very sensitive area. You may be interested to iear that t ere are

are so sensitive.

 LECTURE THIRTY
 (rednesday, April 2)
 
Before we get started I want to expand a little bit on what I was talking about
 
last ti m
a, which was a bit parenthetical to the major feature of the lecture, but I
 
thought after the lecture that I should have taken it a little further than I did.
 
That was this thing t
hat I
'm beginning to sense from so m
a of you that has come
 
up in previous semesters--"whether or not you hear what you think you ought to
 
By the end of the semester, we will have evolved several models of musical sys-
tems--several models of "This is a basic way in which they sing in Sub-Saharan Africa"
 
for example, or a model of South American Indian music. It i
s crucial that you under-
stand what a model is and what it's for: a model is (in terms of a large area, such as
 
"
South American Indians", for instance, if you're going to think about them as a kind
 
of inter-related group) a general picture of what these people •
.
'
eneraliy do. Every in-
dividual member of that model, however, does not have to behave in that particular way,
 
and when you have a model it is u
sed to make visible to you distinctive features of the
 
individual groups within the model or outside it. In other words, you can then say that
 
the Omaha Indians correspond to most Amerindians in the following features, and don't
 
correspond to the model in the following features.
 
This gives you a way of making sensible ca m
parisons.  3
ut I find that most people
 
el that a model is...If, for instance, you have your model here (
(drawing a five-point d
 
ar on board)) and you have a six-pointed star to compare with it, wither the model is
 
wrong or the individual culture is wrong —that's the kind of reaction that people give
 
ie. They can't look at a six-pointed star and say "Well, these two points are the same,
 
and these two points are very close together, and these points are very much the same...
 
and there's this little squiggle down at the bottom and isn't that interesting? This
 
oarticular culture coincides in five areas and doesn't coincide in the sixth."
 
You have l
earned sor thing by comparing it with t
he model...hut the model is not
 
"wrong" because there is a six-pointes star contained within the five-pointed star.
 
Neither is the particular culture wrong. I find that people have a tendancy, when they
 
don't get absolute correspondence, to reject either the model or try to change the cul-
ture around til they fit--ne L
t1er of these is a correct r
eaction. Try to bear t
his in
 
mind
  
This is not what comparison i
s supposed to do. The whole point in creating a
 
model i
s to g
ive you the opportunity to say "
There is correspondence here and there
 
i
s non-correspondence there". It gives you a way- of taking this mass of perceptions
 
and boiling it down and giving you some way of attacking the problem, so that at the
 
end you should come up with some state m
ent t
hat says that your people is like other
 
people in the same area, or in this sa
ne mode of living, in the following features
 
but it shows it's distinctive nature in terms of these other features .
.. 
which are also
 
very useful and interesting, and is the way we want human beings to be, after all.
 
We don't really want everybody to follow t
he model--think what a dull world that would
 
be. What's really interesting about the world is the combination of similarity and
 
difference from human being to human being, from man to man, college class to college
 
class, from -eople to people--each one of them is somewhat alike, yet sort of different,
 
too. This is just one way of trying to pin-noint what t
he alikeness and disalikenesses
 
are.
 
We were talking last t
.imeabout one feature of the musical communications system
 
which relates to the natu r
e of the sounds being produced, particularly in terms of the
 
melody. l
ie had divided this up into '
unison behavior'--that Is, everybody singing the
 
same note at the same time (this could be called 'monophoney', although I would sug-
gest that monophoney is occasionally used by ethnomusicologists as an equivelant to
 
'
solo', and we're lumping solo and group performances together under this single cata-
gory)...people are singing the same note at the same time, including '
social unison',
 
in whtch people are singing an octave apart--and the second catagory, '
heterophoney'--in
 
which there is an extre m
e lack of co-ordination, but basically people are singing the
 
same thing at the same time in a highly individualistic fashion 'b,,
r
 the way, this i
s
 
the hardest music for Americans to understand and come t
o terms with; you are going t
o
 
fight yourself to realize that people are doing this on purpose for their own artistic
 
effect, an effect that is sought after and admired by the people who behave this was;
 
it does have something extremely interesting to say about the way in which they look
 
at the world in general) —and all the rest is '
polyphoney'--that is, whenever there
 
is anything that most of u
s would call "harmony".. .
all other types of producing sound
 
on the instrumental and the vocal level, listening to the melodic part.
 
I started last time to tell you that t
here are various kinds of polyphony, and
 
there was one kind that we had already spotted: that was "drone"- "drone" being the
 
holding of a single tone underneath a melody that is g
oing on at the same time. This i
s
 
a very, very common type of polyphoney which is u
sed, I think, everywhere they have
 
polyphoney at all..,but it's sort of featured in certain cultures; certain cultures
 
really like it and build their instruments, for instance, to make it happen. The bag-
pipe is a good example of this; the bagpipe produces drone polyphoney--that's what i
s
 
is built to do.
 
Another kind of polyphoney is "occasional chords". Then you use the term'chord'
 
in ethnomusicology, by the way, you mean the simultaneous sounding of any two or more
 
pitches. Polyphoney with occasional chords is exactly what it sounds like: people are
 
mostly singing in unison, but every once in a while they will go into a chord--one part
 
will distinguish itself and go lower or higher than the melodic line.
 
Then there is "parallelism" or "parallel harmony" in which t
he two parts maintain,
 
and continue to maintain, a distance from each other. If your melody is going along
 
lika this the harmony will go along like this (
(Drawing on board)). (
(Example: Merrily
 
We Roll Along in parallel harmony.)) That's parallel harmony: the top line was moving
 
along exactly with the bottom line in this case--it could, of course, be underneath
 
the melody.
 
Parallel harmony, by the way, is a feature of a musical system with which you are
 
very familiar .
.. 
no, not rock and roll 
.
.. 
Mexican music--a great deal of Mexican music
 
is done in parallel harmony (I'm talking now about mestizo, not Mexican Indian music).
 
In Mestizo music you find long sections of parallel harmony which is one of the charac-
terizers, one of the ways in which you can tell it by ear, a particularly melting kind
 
of sound. (
(STUDENT: It's called "primera y segunda", first l
eader and second leader))
 
The melody is usually on the first part, isn't it...and the s
econd part above?
 
You find this kind of harmony occasionally in the United states, where T think
 
it was picked up from Mestizo music from Mexico. (
(STUDENT: Usually a 3rd above?))
 
(Yes, ordinarily it tends to be a third although I have heard parallelism in 6ths,
 
which is a very interesting sound.) But one of the ways for men and women to sing to-
gether in Texas, and I think they picked this u
p from Mexico, i
s for the man to sing
 
in a high voice taking the melody, and the woman taking the third above in her low
 
r
ange--the two voices are very blendy at those l
evels...lt's a very common way to sing
 
where I come from.
 
The next kind is "harmony", which is characterized by something t
hat's a little
 
difficult t
o define but wh ch I think everybody know's when t
hey hear it: it's sometimes
 
described as "vertical richness", that is, you hear a lot of things going on at the s
ame
 
t
ime, not just two parts as in the case of parallelism (where you mostly get just two
 
parts doing it), but there is a vertical feeling about the music. It's extremely enriched
 
by the addition of a number of parts, and some musical systems feature this also: for
 
example, the Central Russian choirs s
ing this way, with a tremendous am unt of richness
 
in the harmony and lots of different parts (
sometimes 8-10-12 different parts all going
 
at one time making these big, bosomy, luscious c
hords coming out)...and they'll sing
 
that way all the way through.
 
The l
ast type is "counterpoint", in which you may have a lot of parts but there
 
is a continuous feeling of each part taking it's own melodic line and crossing all the
 
time. The best example would be what we did in class the other day: Row, Row, Row Your
 
Boat sung with three parts going. There is no sense of vertical richness in this at all--
everybody is sing their own line--arid a diagram of t
his would look more like t1s, a
 
kind of interweaving of lines, rather than these big, luscious chords.
 
roint, for example, is the sort of thing you heard the pygmy groups doing,
 
th s feeling that everybody was s
inging his own tune and it came out well
 
t
ogether.
 
As we go along you c
an hear examples of these in the samples on the tape.
 
I have been restricting my remarks to vocal ideas, but we had begun listening to
 
t
he same kind of effects in terms of instrumental, or orchestral, u
se. '
what we're basic-
ally concentrating on here i
s: unison, heterophony, and polyphony. If, as we go along,
 
you can spot the polyphonic type, it will make it more interesting I think, but essen-
tially we want to be sire that everybody gets the distinction between these three
 
types because they come along with very different types of human behavior.
 
(
(TAPE))
 (
(...with miscellaneous voiced-over comments))
 
(
(In regard to a Sourthern fiddlers)) Notice t
here that he is attemnting to make
 
a solo instrument, which normally plays just one string at a time, into a polyphonic
 
instrument, and he i
s using a kind o
f drone underneath most of the time • He's trying
 
to hit two strings at the same (
 alot of Southern folk fiddlers will flatten out t
he
 
bridge on the instrument to make it easier to hit two strings at the same time) in-
uicating t
hat polyphonic playing is very important. You will find other areas of t
he
 
country, for exmnple: New England, where hitting more than one string at a time i
s con-
sidered a mistake; t
hey like a single melodic line going very purely, whereas poly-
phony is stressed in instruments in the South.
 
(
(Student asks about coding the drone...)) I think you'd have to double code
 
on that...I'd say "occasional drone"--that's what it really i
s...but it's definitely
 
polyphony, and t
hat's what we're r
eally interested in.
 
(
(TA
))
 
(
(in regards to mouth organ...)) I
'd say that was drone with o
ccasional cords.
 
I think if I
'd have to pick just one, I
'd have to say "drone", because that drone r
eally
 
stands aut...it was ooviously being featured.

his particular course told me that he got a class to sing heterophony
 
h
.j having everybody sing "Down By The Old Mill Stream" just a little bit off from the

Actually as you c
an see, this i
s both very sinpie and
ry complicated at the
 
same time. If you keep to your three divisions it's relatively simple. If you start
 
dividing up the types of polyphony you begin to get yourself into a little bit of dif-
ficulty because these are not exciusives--that i
s, you cm have two or three of these
 
going at the same time. In a very complicated piece of music you can have all of them
 
being used at different times. Obviously, if you were doing a Beethoven symphony you
 
would find that different kinds of polyphony were being used at different timesin the
 
particular piece, or from different sections of the orchestra. Again, you c
an divide u
p
 
your orchestra, depending on the l
evel at which you want to look 
.
.. (
(Student asks whether
 
you can do the same with a chorus)) Yes
  
The reason that polyphony takes over, in effect, is that it tends to come alonct
 
with more complex societies, in a very complicated kind of relationship. Where did we
 
hear the most complicated kind of polyphony, the most counterpoint? .
..
 With the pygmy,
 
who have the most simple kind of social orgainization .
.. 
so it isn't just complexity;
 
something else is going on that determines whether or not a society developes polyphony
 
-u
v.  foody sings in unison, somet ime or another; then some people
 
y
, and some people seem to go into polyphony--there are sort
 
of two different routes. (
People who u
se heterophony rarely u
se polyphony, and vice
 
versa--except in mounting songs, where you get heterophony because everyone is just
 
out of their skulls).
 
(
( Tt
hJENT: Do they know what causes it?)) There are some co-occurances, which I
'll
 
tell you about next t
ime, but for the moment: it seems to have something to do with t
he
 
nature of polyphony, which i
s that there are two complimentary voices. In all polyphony,
 
what you have aretwo people or two instruments phonating some thing different at the
 
same t
ime--two or more. And if you think about where this comes from--on the very most
 
basic level--it cones from the difference beti,een men a
nd women.
 
So what happens'when a society goes into polyphony, is that something happens
 
with women--the woman's voice becomes important---and almost in all the places were you
 
find polyphony, you f
ind something going on concerning t
he position of women. At least,
 
t
his is what comes out in comparative studies.

(
(Questions about Mexican band appearance:
 
1
) Did they have lessons? -
-
 I doubt they did...this is traditional music
 
and traditional music is (
traditionally) learned by imitation .
.. 
The big change
 
that we've undergone in the twentieth century is that we now have recordings to
 
imitate, rather than having to hang around local musicians (
Advantage: You can
 
hear the identical performance over and over again). Traditional music not
 
'
taught'--indeed sometimes made more difficult (
story of flamenco guitarist
 
who's father r
ented a hotel room to practice in). Tremendous amount of practicing
 
required--best traditional musicians do little else but practice (
example: t
'ete
 
Seeger).

) Is it mostly dance music that they play? -
-
 Some of it is dance music;
 
some of it is not. (
(Question referred to Greg Truex, who, when pinned down, spec-
ulates that the style developed as a dance accompaniment.)) Dancing in traditional
 
societies not as formalized as dancing here and now--people might dance to t
he
 
music or they might not, as they feel the urge. Greg: There is music played for,
 
say, religious occasions to which there would definitely be no dancing; but music
 
for social occasions, as this music is, implies dancing--I'm pretty sure that
 
everything they play is intended for dancing,
  in some way.
 
3
) Is their music written down? -
-  Some tunes (
eg- La 3
amba) do exist in
 
written form, but I very much doubt that they learn any o
f their music that way--
in fact, you would find that would be the hard  way. Also, traditional music i
s
 
composed at and on the specific traditional instru m
ent with which it will he
 
played--and i
t is g
enerally easier to learn i
t first-hand, from instrument to
 
ins rumerit, than to convert music to transcription and back to music again.
 
Something that looks impossible on music paper may actually come quite easily
 
on the musical instrument on which it is played. (
(This last is a considerable
  
paraphrasing of your com m
ents--you might want to check the tape. Also .,
 as an
 
example of the above, it is easy to play in C# on the piano, but that key is
 
almost impossible to read off the page--NH))  • .
.. end paraphrasing...))
 
Systems grow up as wholes--dancing and instrumentation and tunes and styles are
 
all part of a total complex that works together.
 
(Incidently, I just wanted to comment briefly: my feeling was that someday I would
 
like to get together with the g
entleman who was doing most of the talking and discuss
 
"the Black influence", because I felt it was quite strong in certain aspects. I don't
 
think you can hear music that r
eminds you of American Black spirituals but neither do
 
American Black spirituals remind me of West African dance music. In other words, there
 
has been a tremendous change in the new world, but there are elements of that perfor-
mance that seemed to me did not come from Europe and did not come from what I know about
 
native,Indian cultures in that area.
 
For example, just one of the t
hings was this tradition of competitive improvization
 
which has gone into the New World wherever there are Blacks. They do the same kind of
 
thing in Trinidad; they do the same kind of thing amongst Blues singers... I agree with
 
(
(the gentleman)) that the style is indigenous--the style only happened there--but it
 
opened as a result of a number of influences that came into that region. So you can
 
ok at it as one of the glorious contributions that came out of Mexico and came from
 
place else in the world. This is a whole new style and it was invented down t
here.
 
ut I think you can see, also, certain kinds of influences that were u
tilized in order
 
to make this thing happen.)
 
Getting back to the topic of '
dance' that was raised--this is actually the sub-
ject of a film that I wanted to show you this morning. We haven't dealt with the dimen-
sion of  movement in connection with music, yet, but all of the parameters of behavior
 
seem to be intertwinedand you can find consistencies in movement style that work right
 
in to the musical system. I hadn't planned to go into this right now, but since the film
 
is available I
'd like to mention just a little bit about it.
 
a
iid certainly a great deal of our communication is involved with movement patterns. 7,
7
e
 
find, not only in the simplistic idea of gesture--you -know, g
estures can he u
sed to cor
n-
mwücate within a culture (
(Example given))--but linguists have also studied infinitely
 
more subtle communications in t
erms of movement and they've discovered that a large part
 
of the sommunications system is involved in g
esture along with speech---that move me nt  and
 
speech are inextricably intertwined.
 
There is sort of a joke to the effect that if you tie an F
taliants
 hands behind
 
his back he can't talk, but we find that this is true of many other peoples besides I-
talians (
as a matter of fact, in probably all peoples). There i
s constant movement going
 
on while people are communicating. (
I don't know if you've noticed this, but I find I
 
have great trouble trying to lecture without moving my hands .
.. 
and notice the exact
 
synchrony--see, when I was trying to think of the exact word I wanted to use I had to
 
hold my hand up here, and then when I said "synchrony" I could put it down again.)
 
As a
 matter of fact, it has been discovered that h
ivan beings are continuously
 
movi ng  in exact synchrony  with extremely refined elements of their speech. .
 .which sug-
gests, in a wa y,  that we  are dancing all the time we are talking. Some studies have been
 
done of people talking to each other in which the communication was filmed and t
hen t
he
 
film was looked at at the rate of .
.. 
you know, normal film speed is 2
1 frames/second-
twenty-fourth of a secortdl And it's been discovered that people are moving in exact
 
synchrony with their speech (
(at least to within an error of)) a twenty-fourth of a sec-
ond.
 
(
It's very bad to think about this, by the way, because you begin to become con-
cious of your gestures and then you can't talk at alli I don't know how anybody lectures
 
on kinesics--it must be just absolutely maddening. This i
s one r
eason I resist so firm-
ly doing a seminar on ldnesics--I don't think I could stand it, emotionally speaking.
 
As soon as you become concious of that kind of thing communication just stops--it i
s
 
supposed to be at a micro-level; you're not supposed to have to think about it, in my
 
opinion.)
 
For a demonstration of the degree to which this incredible synchrony goes on,
 
evidence that people who are listening to people are also moving in
 
'4th the speaker. So that you and I
, when we are really communicating,
 
are dr
ic'n , in effect, a v
ery tiny, unconcious dance together. We are partnering in an
 
oxchan
. Pnd if you are out of synch with me, I notice it. As a matter of fact, they've
 
discovered that schizophrenics do not synchronize either with themselves, when they speak,
 
or with anyone speaking to them--this is no doubt why we get this sort of vague sense
 
of malaise when we're talking to somebody who is around the bend mentally. We sense the
 
fact, on a very refined sort of level, that we are not synchronizing, that we are not
 
therefore communicating...
 
So it is natural that you should think that music, which is a physical act, should
 
be tied in with elements of dance...and so indeed it is. But motion also is involved with
 
other things that people have to do to stay alive, such as working, walking from here
 
to there, finding their food and preparing it, and doing all kinds of basic human jobs
 
to keep ourselves going, so again you extend this tie-in even further.
 
Movement within dance seems to have some kinds of interesting interactions with
 
movements that people habitually do within their daily lives. That's what this partic-
ular film is about: it shows a g
roup of people in New Guinea--the name of the tribe is
 
the Marings--and this footage was taken of Marings doing various kinds of t
hings including
 
dancing. When you just look at their movement style, you begin to see some relationships
 
between what they do all day long and how they organize their dance.
 
(
(FILM))
 (Tape not checked for incidental comments.)
 
I don't know how convincing that is, that demonstration. I think one thing that
 
bothers people who watch movement of that type, trying to come up with generalized con-
clusions, is our conviction that when we u
se tools, the tools determine the way in which
 
they are used. We have certain feelings of...I think rather m ical...about tool-use--that
 
all human beings use them the same way because there is "an efficient way in which to
 
u
se a tool" and "an inefficient way to use a tool". But if you watch different human
 
beings handling the same tools in a comparative basis, you come to be aware of the fact
 
that human beings impose all kinds of movement patterns on tools. There are people who
 
u
se short-handled hoes and who bend over all the way to do it, although one would think
 
V 
it would be easier if one u
sed a longer-handled hoe--but that is a T
estern notion.
 
The u
se of the axe is as varied as human behavior can possibly be. I saw some
 
films about a year ago of some African gardeners who were hoeing in a large field
 
somewhat similar to the kind of terrain which you saw here, and they were hoeing in
 
synchrony--that is, every hoe came down at the same time.(As you saw hero, there was
 
no synchrony except in terms of rather loose co-ordination in the dance, where you would
 
expect to find synchrony, and certainly very little in the work-movements.) Furthermore,
 
these guys were not only coming dawn at the same time, but they were up-stroking dif-
ferently (
which was really rather fascinating to watch). So you had a continuous balance;
 
everybody came up their own way--some of them would twirl, some of them would curve,
 
some of them would raise it up like this--there were innumerable variations in the up-
swing and then--BAMM--everybody would come down together. So you had this complete bal-
ancing back and forth between total group orientation alternating with movements of ex-
treme individualization. It was really fascinating to see.
 
This '
trunk' business that they kept talking about--again, it seems to me, it's
 
difficult for us to realize how culturally-determined this is--but when you see (using
 
the same example) Black Africans hoeing, t
here i
s a continuous sinuous movement of the
 
trunk--they don't use the trunk in the rather rigid fashion that you saw here. The trunk
 
is divided into about eicht areas, as far as I can t
ell, with flack Africans and it's
 
always going like this all of the time.
 
Human behavior is very much more complex than it appears on the surface, qnd a
 
great deal could be gain, I think, by looking not just at a film like this (where you're
 
just one kind of movement-style) but at contrasted movement-patterns to see how
 
ah can be done in so many different ways in different cultures.

 LECTURE ThI TY-TH
E
 (wednesday, April 2
)
 
(
(Class business))
 
Last time we were talking about the existence of three sort of basic ways that
 
both chorusses and orchestras can function. We divided that orgainization u
p into "
u
n
i
-
son", "heterophony", and "polyphony". Then we talked about various polyphonic types,
 
and I had suggested to you that the existence of polyphony--in particular, because unison
 
is all over the place, it's almost a universal, but polyphony is not nearly as fre-
quent nor is heterophony--the occurance of polyphony, and particularly of certain poly-
phonic types, is pretty clearly a relationship between the concept of "muiti
vo ice d negs
P
,
 
the fact that people are talking independantly of each other. And I suggested to you
 
that this may prove to have some kind of correlation with the independanee of sex roles
 
within the society.
 
This has worked out, in some preliminary studies,to be the case--that i
s, you g
et
 
polyphony in societies in which women have access to means of production; this seems to
 
e the clearest correlation. This factor varies a great deal according to the type of
 
subsistence: in gathering societies women are apt to be extremely important in terms of
 
the location of food; in agricultural societies, women's roles are often important and
 
sometimes not--sometimes they're restricted from doing labor in the fields, it's all
 
men; in hunting and fishing societies, you are apt to find male teams functioning on
 
the l
evel of basic access to subsistence, more crucially than are women's teams or mixed
 
teams.
 
It i
s interesting to note that t
his sort of t
hing varies very definitely: the ex-
istence of polyphony, and the existence, particularly, of certain types of polyphony,
 
vries very definitely with the base-line type of economic, food-gathering mechanism
 
that a people has.
 
(
(Diagram and explanation of 8-point scale of subsistence levels graphed against
 
presence of polyphony (generally) and counterpoint--apparently a hand-out.))
 
We u
sed to think that counterpoint was an invention of European high-culture; that
 
it only came along when Bach and some of his cohorts began developing their musical ideas.
 
On the other hand, it has been discovered, on the basis of looking at the societies of
 
the world that quite a number of them sing in counterpoint...particuiarlr the "
sim-
plest" people of them all, the people who are most dependant on collecting, where wo-
r
nn and men interact, in effect, in producing the major subsistence. It also goes u
p
 
here (when you get into your  .
gricultural system where you have not heavy agriculture--
in the sense of plow-agriculture--but you have gardening societies where you have m
en
 
and women out in the fields). And it goes way down here, and way op here where you have
 
the final developement of agriculture, and it's practically non-existant in irrigation
 
societies,
 
(
(STUDENT: I don't understand why polyphony decreases so much when the society
 
becomes more stratified, but counterpoint goes up so much...why should counterpoint go
 
up so much in pasturalism and horticulture?)) Pastrualists all move, son't they? I mean,
 
everybody goes. If you've got 70% dependance on pasturalism, then the whole bunch of
 
people have to go —it isn't just the men going out and taking care of things by t
hem-
selves; the women are just as much involved. The dramatic thing is that you get this
 
very sharp rise in the most independent
, form of polyphony we know of, which i
s counter-
point. You get this independant form in those areas where you have a high availability
 
for women to be looked at as important within the economic system.
 
It's not just social--I'm talking here about the economic system and the prod-
uctive system. Amongst peoples where the entire tirbe moves after the reindeer, the women
 
are apt to be highly important, as the men.
 
(
(STUDENT: But, when counterpoint is increasing, why does the line for general
 
polyphony go down so much?)) The line for general polyphony is derived from a division
 
of all the kinds of behavior in the world into three di 9ferent kinds: unison, hetero-
phony, and polyphony (
all types of polyphony together). Since everybody sings in unison
 
some of the time...((May I paraphrase?-
: The line for general pol y
phony represents the
 
occurance of polyphony relative to the occurance of unison or heterophony; the line for
 
counterpoint represents the incidence of counterpoint only--simply whether it does or
 
does not occur, and the degree of occurance.)) That sort of flattens the whole (
(poly-
phony)) curve out. Actually, they are rather mirror images of each other; it's just that
 
the line for counterpoint id more r
iramatie, because it is of one specializ d ty
pe and so
 
it shows it more vividly.
 
(
STUDENT: Do you have a scale for heterophony.)) I have very little on it. It
 
is apparently
- a very
- specialized form of human behavior that is limited in terms of
 
area and in terms of immediate context.
 
We are talking here about productive role behavior. 'hat this means, in sort of
 
large, human t
erms, it seems to me, is that, to the degree that men and women inter-
act in terms of productive behavior, they interact to a certain extent on more levels
 
of equality--that is, they chat back and forth; they are able to interact while the job
 
goes on and t
his leads to a condition of recognition of the complimentarity of r
oles be-
ween the two..-as opposed to the kinds of systems that you'd find in many cultures of
 
the world, where women are put into special catagories and held back from the ordinary
 
interaction that occurs when women and men move together on the same kinds of jobs, rot
 
necessarily doing the same functions together but interacting with each other. The guy
 
digging the hole and the woman putting seeds in is a pattern that you find all the way
 
through Melanesia, for instance--here you have both people working together effect vely
 
on the same job although each of them does a different part of the operation.
 
This is the kind of interaction that is being thought about in terms of this pro-
ductive scale. And it produces a particular kind of interaction in terms of people talk-
ing to each other and singing with each other. But men and women may still function in
 
terms of specialized behavior outside of the productive mechanism--in other words, we're
 
not thinking here that this is a situation in which women are politically, socially,
 
morally, s
exually, and every other way equivelent; we're talking about the existence of
 
these different types of productive behaviors as providing ways in which men and women
 
indicate, by their interaction, their dependance on each other to st y alive.
 
In societies like, for instance, the Eskimo (
as I understond it), you kind of have
 
to be married in order to be able to make it as an Eskimo--not in the social sense, but
 
effectively in an economic sense--in that the jobs that the women do are absolutely vital
 
for people to stay alive: the women have to sew up the clothes, and prepare the food, and
 
do a number of rather specialized functions  without which the Eskimo hunter cannot sur-
vive. On t
he other hand, these roles are carried on in a sense quite 5eperate13r: the m
en
 
go out and do the hunting, and the women are at home doing the things that have to be
 
done (
except when the whole group is on the move). There is practically no polyphony,
 
that I have ever heard, of any variety in Eskimo singing, because of the exclusivity
 
of the male role in terms of the actual getting of food (which has nothing to do with
 
the other dependancies that the Eskimo man may have on his wife). So we're talking here
 
in a rather narrow kind of way about the behaviors that are involved with "getting the
 
dinner back to the people who are going to eat it".
 
I
'm now going to quote from the summary of this particular study:
 
The best way we found for recognizing the feminine contribution to Dublical-
ly recognized social activity, such as song performance, was to see what propor-
tion of the main food-getting task women carry out in the culture. On the whole,
 
where women are excluded from the main food-getting job, they are likely to stand
 
at the edge of the assembly ground and watch the rest of life '
s activities a bit
 
passively. Such is the role of women in most hunting societies, in the Perdas (
(?))
 
societies of the Orient where women are hidden away in the family, and even in
 
parts of '
western Europe where women work in the circle of the house and g
arden,
 
while the men move out through the fields to make t
he harvest and down the road to
 
market with the animals. It was not until the Western woman began to go into fac-
tories that she began to win legal equality.
 
If you think about that historically, that really is quite true. It was when wo-
men began to be an important part of the productive force that the push for legal equal-
ity began to be important.
 
Among most gatherers, many incipient producers, and the majority of cultivat-
ors, however, where women bring back most of the plant food into the village, do
 
the cooking, mind the babies and the house, all of life has a somewhat feminine
 
touch and the voices and bodies of women thread t
hrough the principle rituals.
 
.
..And thus into the singing societies...
 
Subsistence complimentarity is at its maximum amongst g
atherers, early :rd-
eners, and horticulturists, then. Among gatherers, women generally bring in the
 
major part of the food. In early hoe-agriculture, women out-weigh or equal men
 
in productive importance, probably because it was they who domesticated the plants
 
and even the animals. In such societies, women are not so likely to be shut away
 
from the public center of life; not so often are they passive witnesses of social
 
events, but active participants at or close to the center of the stage.
 
So, as the l
evel of complimentarity (
(in food production)) increases, the level
 
of complimentarity in terms of singing role increases.
 
Vocal polyphony, then, may be viewed as a communication about the r
ecognized
 
importance of the feminine role in culture. This hypothesis does much to explain
 
its cross-cultural distribution. Vocal polyphony is far more important among the
 
root-gardening tribes of the americas, where w men do most of the agricultural
 
work, than among the North American hunters and maize-cultivators •  Trans-cultur-
ally, root crops tend to be woman's work. Among the North American Indian, poly-
phony is frequent, as far as we know, only among the collectors of California.
 
'
o1yphony is more common amongst tribal than complex cultures of Asia and
 
Oceania, for at the tribal level women have a more crucial role, not only in
 
agriculture but in animal husbandry. Polyphony i
s more often employed by Africans
 
and mfro Americans than in the folk communities of Europe and America. It is
 
practiced there, however, far more in Eastern Europe where teams of women have
 
traditionally done heavy work in the fields, than in "
estern Europe.
 
So you will find, when you look at your own society again, that the existence
 
and the emphasis and the developement and the type of polyphony all has something to
 
say about, or some degree of co-orcI nation with, what you're findinr out about the
 
way that people live.
 
But there is another kind of quality that begins to grow out of this, and that
 
is: where you have polyphony, not only what kind is it, but how integrated i
s it? Tf
 
you think about choral singing, you can recognize that there are many different kinds
 
of choral singing, in some of which the individual voices stand out (
(and in others of
 
which the voices blend in together)). (
(Examples given: the Mexican band vs. the large
 
olynesian nolyphonic chorusses, in which one can detect...)) a kind of feeling on the
 
part of the singers that everyone blends in together, and it's very difficult to deter-
mine where one voice leaves off and the next begins.
 
his sort of groupy-ness in singing style is the result of an awful lot of very,
 
v
ery complicated factors. In fact, when you begin to try to think how people do  sub-
rdinate their personalities in order to blend, you have to do so many things at the same
 
time that it's a miracle that it ever hap'ens. You have to have tremendously precise
 
tiain ;  you have to articulate the same words with the exact same kind of promunciation;
 
you have to take out all the individual characterizers in your voice and produce a kind
 
of a blending sound. Accoustically speaking
  
Teamwork, on any kind of level, denends on the sub i
rdination of individual desires
 
and individual personality in order to attain a greater goal. Tf yu're trying to shove
 
a huge hunk of stone across the room, everybody's got to hit it at the same instant--it
 
doesn't really make any difference who does it, just as long as it's completely co-ordin-
ated. But any kind of team work requires, as it's first premise, the subordination of
 
the individual human personality. Maybe you would rather shove t
he stone a beat off, but
 
y o u'
re  not going to g
et t
he stone shoved if you do.
 
You have in existence certain kinds of vocal  ulities that dem nd, in effect, the
 
subordination of personality in order to produ e a blending sort of voice for a parti-
cular sort of song. If you think of this in terms of your own c
horil experience, you
 
will realize how difficult it is, in our highly individualistic society, for a chorus
 
to sing prooerly. The conductor has to work and work to get this unified sound. And
 
everybody in the chorus has to bend their effort not to stand out as the star of the
 
performance but to put their voice into the general framewok of all the other voices
 
that are going on at the same time. This is terribly hard for individualistic kinds of
 
people to do.
 
As I pointed out, in these different productive kinds of societies, there are
 
different kinds of jobs that have to go on, and different degrees of individuation
 
that are required to get them done. So one of the qualities that comes out in singing
 
style is this question of "iether or not people like to blend?"--because everybody s
ings
 
a little bit together, but in some chorusses you can tell precisely how many voices are
 
present and who's singing what notes, and there are other chorusses in which you cannot
 
distinguish one voice from another and everybody has apparently agreed on some l
evel of
 
their behavior to interact by suppressing their own individual voices.
 
Now, I 1
 .
ke them both--but there are these differences and they move about t
he
 
world somewhat in co-ordination with the kind of jobs that peoole have to do and t
he kinds
 
of co-ordination that's required of them. Thus in societies where uniform actions are
 
extremely necessary, where there i
s a high degree of comrlimentarity in relationships,
 
you will find maxir
iaun degrees of blend; and in societies where you don't need blending
 
behavior, you don't get it.

 arTUTE THIRTY-FOUR
 (
Friday, May L
i
)
 
Last time I
 was suggesting to you the fairly simple-minded notion that the
 
featuring of multi-pirted singing in a culture probably has some kind of co-0c'iira-ice
 
with the interaction between the sexes in their different vocal ranges in terms of
 
normal, every-day productive behavior. And it seems that, as Ouldmark (
(?)) said, the
 
way you get your grocieries is one of the most significant aspects to look at in any
 
society and a great many things stem from this.
 
With regard to the diagram I put on the board--the bottom line, which shows the
 
occurance of any kind of multi-parted singing within a culture, was a scheme of the o
c-
curance of all kinds of polyphony within these various economic systems. The top line
 
was of the occurance of only one kind of polyphony. A society may not, for instance, do
 
very much singing in terms of drone polyphony but it may do a great deil of contrapuntal
 
type of singing; therefore the two lines could be quite different, and indeed are. The
 
dotted line, which had to do with the occurance of counterpoint, is kind of an interest-
ing one because it has such very strong ups and do,rns, and if you'll remember from the
 
diagram, there was not very much occurance of counterpoint in societies that feature
 
hunting, in societies which are full nomadic pasturalism (mostly deDendant on animal
 
husbandry), and irrigation. Those are the bottom parts of that scale.
 
Counterpoint, you see, is almost total interdependance of the two voices, each
 
voice maintaining its own melodic line, but all linked in in a kind of an orgainizing
 
principle. So, nobody is subservient to anybody else--therefore, under irrigation  you
 
will get a minimal amount because irrigation societies always feature very, very high
 
degrees of social stratification
  
Now, on the other hand, you g
et the highest degree of counterpoint in plow-agri-
cuLtural societies, in simple agricultural, and in gatherers —because in all of these
 
way
's of making your living men and wo:
'en are reasonably interactive within the primary
 
productive process.
 
17
e then went on to examine a feature of the singini style which is really a kind
 
of new direction--we've only sort of fore-shadowed it a little in t
er s of '
a"cent'-- and
 
that is the way the human throat i
s producing the sounds (
"What kinds of voices are the
 
'
beautiful voices' in a particular culture?"). And again we're using the same kind of
 
look across the survival mechanisms for the whole society--how you have to behave in
 
order to stay alive in this particular part of t
he world, under these particular con-
ditions.
 
A formulation that might be interesting for you to play around with is, refer-
ring back again to things I said earlier in the smester, t
he ultimate good in terms of
 
human beings--the sort of base-line ultimate good--is staying alive. The ultimate bad
 
is being dead. I think this is probably fairly true no matter where you live. There are
 
certain kinds of cultural forms that twist this around in various kinds of complex ways,
 
but most of the time the basic law of any living organism is to stay alive as opposed
 
to being dead. So you could even formulate these in sort of ethical terms: then, good
 
behavior i
s that kind of behavior that helps you stay alive, and bad behavior i
s that
 
kind of behavior that helps you not stay alive or increases your chance of g
etting knocked
 
off .
.. 
particularly on a group basis. Therefore, within a society, your ethical system
 
may have a good bit to do with this kind of law; your ethical system may have to do with
 
those behaviors that are important in order to survive within these prtieuiar sets of
 
circumstances (
those become '
good's; r
'onversely, behaviors which are inimical to the
 
survival of the society therefore become 'bad's, disapproved of by society).
 
Now, nobody is '
good' all of the time, or very few people are, but we still have
 
these kinds of built-in concepts: this i
s the way you are if you are a good Bushman,
 
and this is the way you are if you are a bad Bushman. Bad Bushman behavior might be
 
good Somebody-else's behavior under a very different set of circumstances, and this i
s
 
why we don't see any over-all pattern, necessarily.
 
To take this a step further, beauty may revolve around those esthetic criteria
 
that express what's '
good' within a society. This may be why we are so moved by beauty,
 
i
.
n our own sense of terminology or framework, because it expresses for us very ex-
ttely those things that we are agreed upon, in our culture, as being '
good'. And
 
I think this is a useful idea or formulation to keep in the back of your mind when you
 
are thinking about questions of "beautiful voices" or "beautiful i
nstruments". '

and t
he interest that othe  societies
 
show in everybody sounding like themselves, seperately. I think that this reflects a
 
great deal on the ways in which people concieve of groups. Our culture has a tendency
 
to concieve of a '
group' as a tennorary collection of individuals, that we count and
 
number--that's the whole basis for sociologyt we think of grou s as a bunch of human
 
beings that we can then go out and find out all of their individual things about. We
 
rarely think of them as a collective. I think that other r
uftures think of groups in a
 
collective sense.
 
(
Incidently, I initially began t
hin'dng about t
his in connection with the lecture
 
I give on Happy Birthday To You. It suddenly occured to me that one very u
nusual thing
 
about this song is that, when you get to the third line, everybody sings to the person
 
celebrating the birthday what they would call him in ordinary, everyday conversation.
 
So at the same time, one person will be singing "Happy Birthday Pear Gran pa...',  !
...
 
Dear Daddy...", "
...Dear John...", "
...Dear Uncle John. .
."--whatever it i
s t
hat you
 
ordinarily call that person if you are talking to them directly. So when we sing that
 
song in a group, each one of u
s is addressing that song seperately to the individual.
 
'e make that point very clear by the fact that we won't call that name all t
he same;
 
we will consistantly use our method of direct address.)
 
I think this is very much we structure our lives--a group is a bunch of sperate
 
individuals. I think there are other societies that consider groups as more entities,
 
and
*
,ere it is more crucial for you to feel this part of being a group. We never really
 
never feel part of groups very often in any emotional sense (at least those of u
s who
 
are Anglo); we just feel like we happened to drop in for a few minutes with this bunch
 
of people. (
As for example this class--this class has no feeling of '
groupy-ness', real-
ly. We are a bunch of sperate individuals. If I addressed you as '
Class' you would prob-
ably find t
he u
se of the collective title a little offensive--most people in our society
 
don't like very much being addressed as part of a group; they prefer a direct pointing-
out of individuals. Really, the only membership you have is that you happen to come herr
 
to this room every morning at eleven o
'clock. This is just something you do —and it
 
happens that other people are coming here to do the same thing, but you could do it
 
without them.)
 
So this i
s what I
'm talking about in this quality of '
vocal blend'. The reason
 
for taking you through the t
ape is to give you an idea of the variation in human be-
havior vis a vis this particular qu l1ty: to what extent do you feel "groupy" within
 
a group, and to what extent do y
ou feel an individual within a group? This comes oot
 
in terms of certain modifications of the way your voice blends in with other voices.
 
This is a very complicated thing to do---both psychologically and physically--and
 
i
t is part of a big other kind of complex, other elements of which we wFl g
et into
 
later on...we'll have to take them one at a time.

That was two guys. Remember, you are nut talktn  here about the nrecision ;

that it was one guy with a little echo-chamber on the mike; just a smidge of an echo ef-
fect put in. But you don't get one guy with a kind of a brushy, raspy, breathy, or hoot-y

here's a l
ean, a direction, and r
nost

(Some confusion on this one--there appear to be two distinct groups, but within
 
each group there is considerable blend. You comment: There is a definite difference in
 
quality between the two (leaders) and the group, i
sn't there? It seemed to me that the
 
group was being kind of unified, and the two singers were kind of individualized. The
 
leaders were singing in excellant time dimension...ln excellent  oly-hor
iy, '
)ut my
- feeling
 
was that there was an edgy sort of quality to their voices which was keeping each voice
 
distinctive from the other. I would put it somewhere in this middle section--it didn't
 
1
/
 
seem to be either on or the other  
 I think that one problem with this bit of tape
 
is that there are no "highs" on the leaders .
.. I suspect that they were much closer to
 
the microphone and thus overloaded the mike causing distortion and eliminating the high
 
frequencies from their voices. The chorus, which I suspect was at greater distance from
 
the mike, is not overloading the equipment so we can hear their highs. Thus a (
perhaps)
 
artificial difference in sound between chorus and leaders is produced, as well as an
 
(
again perhaps) artificial blend in the leaders's voices (without the highs, the two
 
voices would sound "blendy" whether they were that way in real life or not). Perhaps
 
this could be checked out with a good soundman .
.. I
'm only speculating, myself.-NH))
 
(
(TAPE))

if you are going to blend, in g
eneral you are going to find a kind of lan to-wares
 
producing a special kind of voice that is enabled to blend. If you're going to1  very
 
unified as opposed to very lndividualized 
.
.. 
And there are a number of features of the
 
way your voice has to sound in order to achieve this kind of blending: it, overall, has
 
to be kind of relaxed and it has t
o be relatively clear. And we're now going to start
 
thinking about a couple of independant voice qualities--whether or not they are featured
 
in the singing style. The first one is very similar to the instrumental problem we wern
 
snis ing before: the degree of noise that you let into the voice.
 
This whole area appears not to be a simple question of individual physiological
 
state (
as it is with me at the moment). In terms of vocal performances, i
t seems to tie
 
n 7ith qualities t
hat are eahasized or not er
nnhasi ed in terms of child-training. I
've
 
mentioned some of t
hem before.
 
There seems to be a very high oceurance o
f whit you night call a '
r soy" or
 
"noisy" singing style with child-training for independence and individualism--that
 
is, in those societies where it's very important for children to be able to take care
 
of themselves very early and where individuals and independant action is very much val-
ued and encouraged by t
he society, you are a t to find a
 very high o
ccurance of a very
 
forceful and.,.towards the masculine .
.. 
sort of vocal performance n
eing the very valued
 
one within the culture. On the other hand, in societies where children are trained for
 
group-oriented behavior, you will find less o
f this kind of singing voice vilued within
 
t
he singing style.
 
So, presence or ahnence of noise i
s in some d
egree (
with o
ther kinds o
f charact-
eristics) ass e
iated with this sort of base-line human behavior of "what i
s it important
 
for hurans to be able to do?". "Is it important for your child to be able to go out and
 
be able to hunt his game and bring it back?" or "Is it important for him to be able t
o
 
interact with other children who are doing more or less the same thing?". kre you train-
ing for co-operation or individualism?
 
Both of these are fine values--both of these, in our culture, are trained for all
 
of the time, and we have a rather uncomfortable problem because we have such a complex
 
society that sometimes we need to be individualistic and sometimes we need to be co-op-
erative. But we go more to the individualistic side, I suspect, in our training, although
 
we worry a lot about co-operation, we don't really do that much of it becaus , in a funny
 
way, it really isn't that important to u
s.
 
So our money i
s very rarely where our mouth i
s, in my ooinion, in terms of edu-
cation.

 LECTURE THPITY-FIVE
 (Monday, Hay 7
)
 
(
(Class business: future of class; what will be covered...))
 
Today I
 want to "cle'in up'--in a very brisk kind of way--a few considerations
 
concerning, basically, the vocal qualities that are favoured by a culture. I won't he
 
able to even play you examples of all of these, but I hope to give you a few ideas of
 
the more important considerations.
 
Actually, '
vocal quality' is something that, I think, you can tackly by yourself
 
without havin  had "
of;'cinl training". Yu can  l
etect this for yourself; it i
s a pretty
 
obvious thing and it's apt to be very consistant throughout a particular performance.
 
But it is a u
seful thing to consider, and we'll talk about it very briskly, as I said,
 
today.
 
I think I should give you a bit of an example so that you will know what is meant
 
by the term '
vocal noise', outside of the speaking example that, I think, I was giving
 
you. (
'Vocal noise', by the way, i
s frequently referred to as '
rasp', and it is a qual-
lity that is stressed in some cultures and not in others. And it is a quality in which
 
you will frequently find that there is difference within a culture between male and f
e-
male performers--that is, you may find males singing with quite a lot of vocal noise
 
and  omen singing without very much vocal noise in the same culture. Cross-culturally,
 
v)cal noise seems to have something to do
ith a male principle, or a male element, be-
cause it always works that way---you will rarely find women singing with more rasp, with-
in a culture, than the men do--though, in certain kins of areas where women are quite
 
independant, you will find them singing with quite a lot of noise.)
 
Here are some examples of the range of possiblities for vocal noise.

"
That do those people have in common? Hunting,
 
gathering culture; very strong male-domination, basically, in a very forceful kind of
 
way. They are very far down the subsistence scale; they (
I'm thinking now about "
2
,1
-
ains
 
Indians) move in bands, basically, with sort of minimum group activity--they place a
 
great stress on individual activity; the Australians have a terribly complicated way of
 
keeping trick of relatives, but other than that their system i
s fairly sirple (
their
 
governmental and so-forth systems)...

that's a gentleman from "
rkansas, b the way. In the same
 
section you will find women trying very hard to sing with absolutely no vocal noise, to
 
the point where they go right up into their nose--you get an awful lot of nasel effects--
but they're trying to keep all of that '
harshness' out of their voice.
 
(
(Student says he is singing down in his throat, but where is the '
great vocal

noise'?)) (
(Student says that it i
s just in the one part when he goes '
down low'.))
 
Ten he goes down low he gets quite a lot of it, doesn't he? Py the way, so did the
 
Irish lady--did you notice that?---her only low note she it with much more... What it i
s
 
is t
hroat-singing, as you're pointing out. And in throat-singing you g
et  n awful l
ot
 
of rasp unless you fight very hard to do the opposite, as in opera singing. Let's go
 
on and hear some more examples; maybe it'll become clearer.

(
(Voting...reasonable consensus.)) (
(STUDENT: Do you code for the total vocal
 
effect or...?)) I think in these, again, we'll h
ave to dothe whole thing as a unit. I
 
would myslef... You see, this is a question of kind of fundamental esthetics, in terms
 
of your particular society. 'T
hat you're really asking yourself is "Does it appear that
 
people in this society like voices with a lot of rasp, or does it appear that they try
 
to have very little vocal rasp in their singing?"--(because everybody has sooe, to a
 
certain extent; or if you're tired, as I
 was pointing out before, you are a
pt to have
 
a lot of rasp in your voice where you normally don't.) So what we're loobing for here
 
is a sort of base-line preference. 
For instance, you would not find in our culture anybody who was a top s
incer with
 
e vocal quality of that Australian gentleman we just heard singing about a hawk. It
 
is not a favored  uality--to thot extent--to have that very buzzy kind of voice.
 
would tend to send him off to a voice coach to get that trained out, as f
ar
 
we had so m
ebody around who habitually sang that way. He woul  not be the
 
atra of Ameoican Society. He would not be that sort of normative thing that
 
as oossible,

ccept his singing... (
Joes on to point to
 
Bob Dylan, and others)) I think this represents some very interesting kinds of per-
ceptions within our culture. I think this (
(people with '
harsh' voices are being accepted
 
as popular singers today)) is perfectly true. You see, in a way, your major artist has
 
to be .
.. 
he can't be perfect. If he fits within the cultural norm totally, within every
 
dimension, he is not doing his job which is, in effect, to express beyond the absolute
 
normative value point of his society, becasue societies not only have to stay still,
 
they have to change. And the artist, within any particular society, is always slightly
 
imperfect in t
erms of the normative features, becuase he is fore-shadowing, or going
 
ahead of, certain kinds of changing conditions. So major artists are perhaps not terribly
 
good to look at in terms of what's really going on now, but in terms of what's going to
 
come off. I suspect that the reason we like these artists is that they are moving a lit-
tie bit ahead of where things are at the moment. And the artist is successful or not,
 
depending on where he puts his esthetic bets.
 
It is pre ty clear thaL a guy who is too far out for one period, for instance, i
s
 
er accepted. This has happened over and over and over again. But you also have to r
e-
:
ber that other guys who were very far out never got accepted at all--they went the
 
rong way. We always hear of the exceptions, who did g
et a
ccented after their death. Out
 
t
hink about all of the guys who didn't make it, and died, and nobody ever did  hear
 
their stuff, or like it, particularly.
 
So my feeling is that the wide acceptance of rasp, and quite a variety of other
 
quaiities,within our singing style now--where we didn't u
se to hove it--is indicative
 
of an awful lot of interesting things that are going on within the culture. T c
an't
 
give you a single explanation.. .
1 think it has partly to do with our tremendous adrnir-
ation for Black music, and the inputs of Blacks into the culture in g
eneral; I think
 
it partly has to do with our feeling of being under a tremendous amount of attack, cul-
turally speaking--we're very insecure.
 
(
(STUDENT: Do you think it maight also have something to do with the trend now
 
towards concern with our environment and natural sorts of things...)) Yes, it very
 
r
i ht. There's a tremendous amount of "trying to be Indians", j
ust a
s we tried to
 
tacks for a long time. And there was a brief period when we tried to he Greeks, which
 
always seemed to me was...we had a better chance at being Greeks than we did at being
 
Blacks or Indians. There was a long period when ..
. it didn't g
et to be a large movement,
 
but it was very striking, but there was a tremendous interest in Greek and Balkan 'ance;
 
at every party I ran across somebody who would s
how  ou how to do one of t
hose 7-beat
 
steps that t
he Greek like to do, or had larned Greek songs, or, in many cases, had per-
fected Greek instrumentation, which is very difficult to do--you really have to work; i
t's
 
not a simple thing to do at all. But for some reason it didn't catch on as a mass cul-
ture sort of t
hing —but t
here was something very interesting going on there for a while,
 
though.

(
(Comment that subtleties of this particular tape might be being lost due to
 
the poor audio equipment in the class-room; therefore, it is best to just shoot for
 
the extre m
es--the fine points may not be coming through anyway.))
 
This whole area is concerned, or seem to have some co-occurance, with a kind of
 
masculine factor, culturally speaking; and of all of the kinds of behaviors with which
 
tightest
 
this has been correlated, the
 correlation comes out in terms of childhood-tr in-
ing, as I mentioned to you last time: whether or not childhood-training has to do with
 
developing an independant, highly imaginative, self-expressive, assertive kind of child,
 
or whether you want to develope a co-operative, relaxed, contented, and '
grouny' sort
 
of a child. Because clearly, rasp is a feature that does not lead to groupy blending
 
within your music —although you can have it to a certain extent —but it t
ends to be a
 
feature which, if it's dominant in your singing style, you will not produce highly blend-
ed group performances, in terms of the total sound (we're talking here about the indi-
vidual compnents o.
"
 'that sound, t
hough).
 
Now, both of these methods of training in childhood are....I tried t
o choose words
 
which would suggest that both of these are advantageous--and so indeed they are. (It's
 
advantageous to be independant; it's advantageous to be co-ooeraiive--and t
he  mix-in
 
between t
hese two is a very subtle one, within a society. In te -f
-
.
r
iis of looking at your
 
own ethnography, you may not have the best descriptions of child-training; you may
-
not find an article about it at all. But in terms of going through, say, the  thno-
graphic Atlas, you may find features that are discussed in there that tell you some-
thing about the qualities that are being opted for by poor old parents (
like all of u
s
 
are, or will be) trying the best they can to bring up kids who can cope with the world
 
they see around them. (
And if you've ever thought about this in terms of parenting,
 
feeding in the right amounts--or trying to develope experiences that will give the right
 
amounts--of these qualities is a very subtle and tricky matter.)
 
In your Atlas, though, you'll find things like '
weaning' dis ussed...and you can
 
get a little bit of a notion of what people are training children for by thinking about
 
weaning. Are the infants allowed at the breast until they are 6
', or is there very early
 
and very drastic weaning? This gives you some kind of a notion on whether the society
 
is reasonably relaxed or whether they are trying to push the kid out and say "Be a grown-
up now" pretty quick.
 
There are other factors: the presence or absense of some games give you some
 
clues also. lames of stratagy, for example, involve the co-ordination of several kinds
 
of people; games of simple physical skill (
'which are universal, by the way; every)ody
 
plays that kind of game, but not everybody plays games of stratagy--and games of strata-
gy generally go along with your more complex societies and with training for independanee)
 
There are all kinds of features that you might be able to notice in your ethno-
graphy that you can relate into this kind of factor; plus,....the degree of Indenendance.
 
ou may find that women, in your culture, sing with a great deal of rasp, as well as  your
 
men, indicating an independant kind of role for them--or at least, this i
s one possihil-
you might want to explore.
 
There are a couple of other features that I am just going to mention to you
 
rather briefly, that are important in the vocalization picture. One is the presence or
 
absence of '
sq u
eeze', or tight vocal quality. These are often called '
nasals', but
 
soretimes they don't sound so much '
nasal' as they sound '
sqieezed'_-and that's about
 
the clearest description I can give you of it. The Japanese ldy who's music you can't
 
tolerate on the 30-song sample tape is a very good example of somebody who really doesn't
 
sound like she's singing through her nose, but who sounds very tight and constricted
 
as though her throat were made of cast iron.
 
This kind of quality indicate s
 .
... if you try to do it, if you ty to s
ing with
 
a very tight voice as opposed to a very relaxed kind of voice, you will find th t you
 
tned to sing a little higher than you would ordinarily pitch t
hings and that the total
 
feeling of it is of extreme tension--and indeed it is physiologically the case  that
 
in order to sing with that kind of squeeze, you have to have a comnletely tight vocal
 
apparatus. This kind of behavior, which is clearly- desirable in many cultures and clear-
ly undesireable in our culture (we say), seems to have tremendous emotional impact on
 
people. It has been found by the Cantometrics people, in doing testing for the arcser
ice
 
of this quality with lots of listeners, that it is very difficult to g
et a good t
est
 
out of Americans, because we invariably tend to rate music we like as being very un-
nasal, and music we don't like as being very nasal. It appears to send a tremendous
 
emotional message--the presence or absence of squeeze--and indeed, it appears to hve
 
some relationshi  to the emotional state of well-being within the community, in the
 
sense of t
he most fundamental relation of all, which i
s between m
.
-41e5 and females. This
 
is apparently what people really weep over; and squeeze has something very much to do
 
with weeping.
 
If I start to talk--you might try this the next time you're driving down the
 
freeway and can assure yourself of total privacy, becaune it's a r
ather embarrassino
 
experience and you'll never do it in fron of anybody--if you begin to talk out loud,
 
using a progressively tighter and tighter and tighter and tighter voice, until you
 
are really squeezing as hard as you can, you will find that in a few minutes tears come
 
to your eyes--and in a few minutes you can find yourself crying, if you've anything to
 
cry over--this is a good way to g
et yourself doing itL You also have to force your voice
 
up, and you'll find that t
his completely immobilizes your throat--in order to do it--and
 
pretty soon (
especially, as I say, if you've anything on your mind that you want to
 
cry over) you will find yourself crying. It's a very odd kind of s
ensation.
 
This, then, seems to relate to a society's most fundamental emotional hang-
s,
 
which, when you come right dovm to it, seem to have something to do with t
he relation-
ship between mies and females. That is, according to t
he correlations that the nresence
 
or absence of this quality has been tested with, where women are really nut down and
 
really isolated and really vengeful and really taking it out on their men--because you
 
can't put people down and have them really like you--this is where you find the big
 
presence of squeeze. It's a
 very, very odd kind of thing, and very interesting from both
 
the female and the male points of view, may I say. I
'll amplify this for you a little
 
bit more, becuase it's not just plain sexual congress, i
t's whet'
-ier the sexes can g
et
 
together in a humane and protected manner, and one group isn't completely i
solated ind
 
held behind bars as you find in, for instance, the Near East.

 LECT1JdE THIRTY-SIX
 
(Tedriesday, May 9
)
 
I thought we'd try to take up about where I left off .
.. I was discussing, in a
 
sort of gneralized way, the degree of correlation between all of t
hose factors of the
 
music t
hat suqest "hlendy-ness"--that i
s, relaxed voices, O Cf
l voices, absense of
 
squeeze and tremendous degrees of nasality, good tonal blend (these kinds of factors
 
appear to correlate very strongly.. .
ineluding the elaborate-ness of polyphony and t
he
 
degree of devel
e
nt of polyphony --with factors conc rning the interaction of women
 
and men within t
he society.
 
Purely and entirely on the level of sexual behavior, if you look t
hrough the Pth-
nographic Atlas, you'll discover that there are a lot of permmiations that various societ-
ies engage in in regulating male/female interactions, in the areas of sex and procrea-
tion. These run between sort of minimal societal intervention in any kind of way, and
 
maximum. But a
 more useful way to look at it---at l
east the data from the singing a
ctivi-
ty has grouped t
hem this way--is to look a
t the various ways in which societies handle
 
the eternal question.. .
that boys and g
irls grow up; and they are eventually going to come
 
into sexual meetings; and that they are eventually going to have children--this is some-
thing that a great lot of society's mores are organized around, this fundamental human
 
fact.
 
There is one g
eneral way of handling this that can be termed t
t
p
issive
 and pro-
tective", and there is another whole bunch of ways of handling this t
hat can be t
ermed
 
'
restrictive and punitive". It's not just a question of sexual access, it's a question
 
f what happens afterwards that's involved here. And in those areas of the world where
 
u
n have both )ermiss veIess a
nd o
:'etoction---in the s
ense jf th  vario'is rul s of what
,
 
-Denis aheu, for istanne, pregnancy r
esults; or how much say d
oes the c
-i
rl 
ahout
 
who  she sleeps with, under what kinds of circumstances--those that are not only a little
 
b
it relaxed, but also protected (in the sense that the woman is not just fair game for
 
a
ny guy that comes down the pike; and also in the sense that, if a pregnancy results,
 
s
he i
s not stoned out of her village or else murdered--which happens in s
ome societies
 
when an irregular union takes place, an un-sanctioned u
nion) in those areas you find a
 
very high oceurance of maximum blend in the h
armonic organization,
 
Th t's a kind of rather pretty idea, because what it r
e ll.y raans i
s that neo-
pie can relax with each other. And what it really means on the other end i
s that peo-
ple always have to be up-tight with each other. There are all kinds of human variations
 
for working out this problem in a protective, permissive way. There are, for examole,
 
such things as trial marraiges, which are institutionalized in some cultures.
 
A system that's very common, I believe, throughout Oceania, where you hwe very
 
large choruses in excellent blend, is that boys sleep in one hut (when they become ado-
lescents) and t
he girls sleep all in another hut. And everybody oretends that they are
 
being watched over--and in a sense, you see,they are .
.. 
by this removal--on the other
 
hand, everybody knows that the boys sneak into the girls' hut eve-y once in a while.
 
And If a child is produced out of this, then the couple i
s expected to formalize their
 
union. So it's simultaneously permissive, but it's protective in the sense that t
he
 
girl is not just "fair game"--she has lots of other girls around her to help her ta"e
 
care of things if she is assaulted by some young man she doesn't like; on the other
 
hand, if she does like him, they can get together under circumst'nces which make her not
 
frightened of the fact that she might possibly have a child.
 
So, it's not just permissiveness. There's this important element of protective-
ness on the one hand, and punitiveness on the other extreme. Every society has woked oot
 
variations, but they generally lean to one side or the other, with certain degrees of
 
punitiveness, perhaps, being written into a basically very permissive and protective code.
 
other words, the possiblities for human variation along this single line--in how do
 
r
ou govern and organize this kind of behavior--alone are extreme.
 
These do s
eem to correlate out  r
ith producing people who not O
:]
.y c
an blend in
 
t*eir vocal nroduction, bit who like to blend; as opposed to people who don't blend in
 
t
heir vocal production and who don't l
ike to blend--that i
s, t
hey don't make any effort
 
alon7 this particular line; it i
s not "beautiful" to them.
 
The obvious individual emotional kinds of passions that g
et let loose, in t
erms
 
of t
his area of behavior, are extremely stong. And it seems to me to be very possi'le
 
to oroduce a g
en ' d s
ense of "up-ti ht-ness" o
r a general snse of "re axition and
 
enjc
)yment" .
.. All of th  areas of your life have t
heir
 
side. And how you feel inside is clearly and strongly
 
comes out--everybody agrees with this.
 
So this is a very big idea that I think will be u
seful to
 
both your own society and anybody else's
 
happen to hear. The degree to which t
his
 
together with other people and produce a
 
strictures of that particular society...
 
Again this interacts with another factor t
hat I
've already mentioned- the degree
 
of access of women to productive roles, and the  type of access (wnether or not tey
 
are complete, equal members of a work team; how all o
f this is worked out; whether they
 
have specialized roles; there are, again, all kinds of permutations here). It see s to
 
me that when you look at just these two factors--the access of men and wo"en to each
 
other; the access of women to the productive system--within a culture, and you think of
 
all the different kinds of ways in which this behavior can be demonstrated and can be
 
reflection on how you feel i
n-
r
eflected in the way
 your vo ce
 
you in thinking about
 
society...just a
ny kind of music that yo
 
melding, and relaxing, and being able to c
et
 
s
ingle unified sound, can o
ccur within t
he
 
worked out within any single culture, you begin to sense some of the beauties and intri-
cacies of the musical system that expresses this. And you being to realize some of the
 
reasons why everybody's musical style is different--every cultural style i
s different--
because there are s
o many Possibilities in just these two variables...and there are lots
 
of others.
 
They aPpear t
o be reflective, within a very beautiful calibration of musical be-
havior (these are gross studies that I
'm citing to you here, but they sort of have to
 
be large to begin with where you don't have any idea yet how far down you can break any
 
one of these features of nehavior that we're talking about .
.. 
and I t
hink an enormaous
 
amount of extremely exciting research can come out of this as we find
, out more and more)..
 
Now we've really been talking so far, in ethnoloric l terms, qbout only three
 
major factors: complimentarity (the degree of coinplimentarity within the culture in t
e-n3
 
all kinds of the musical behavior); a factor that has to do with differentiation, the
 
numbers of differentiated roles, and the number  of specialized
,
' activities  hat go on
 
within the culture; and then a sort o
f edde, g
neral factor or energy.. .
ho-r much moxie
 
do people have to  u
t into anything .
.. and this seems to correlate very strongly with
 
the amount of protein intake (
 w
1- re you have excessive amounts, or L
'rge amounts of
 
protein, you have in general rather striking, self-confident l
evels of behavior: people
 
can be loud, people can be forceful, people can b
e aggressive, people can put some
 
z
ip into things because they have the "
zip" in their 5od1es t
o move wit
1  .
 
Really, when you begin to turn on to this kind of t
hinking about music, you c
an
 
come up with all kinds of really interesting possibilities. A few years ago, I had a
 
kind of an experience, thinking along these lines, that I found kind of u
seful in think-
ing a
nd further examination of certain phenomena of our rarti uiar era. I was dniv.n
 
over Sepulveda Boulevard, coming to school, one day and t
hinking in r
ather idle fashion
 
about The Jefferson Airplane, and wondering why they played so loud. I had been to a
 
earsal of the Jefferson Airplane, and they had soent most of the r
ehearsal yelling to
 
guy in the sound booth because their enormous amplifiers were overLoading the speak-
.,r
 
stem. They would squeal and do all of the things that they do when i
T
hev're overloaded,
 
so the guy would turn them down, and all of the Jefferson Air lane would ston and s
cream,
 
-
 loud that I could feel the
 
as anything I bad ever lea
.
 
:
his was 3-IL years ago.) It was louder than '
loud', and I was rather idley
- thinkine a-
aut this, and I suddenly rer abered one o
f the Airplane, their bass-player, I don't
 
remember his name.
 
e had long, yellow hair that kind of curled under in a "page-boy", a
nd a black
 
beret and s
hades, and he was extremely tall, and thin and frail-looking, and very lan-
guid in his movements (
accentuated by his shades, which didn't allow you to see any ex-
pression on his face). He was holding the guitar like this, and every once in q T
hi T
h
 
he would go (
(demonstration)) and the sound...it would justknock you down, the an unt
 
of sound he was makings The whole place was just being .
.. 
the whole air was full of t- a
 
sound. And I suddenly got a vivid visual recollection of a picture I once saw of Louis
 
Armstrong, with his face '
absolutely contorted with strain, and sweat all over his fore-
head, and his eyes screwed up, blowing with all of his intensity into t
his horn o
f his,
 
putting everything he had into it. ind I suddenly r
ealized,  I wa
 oing exactly t
he
 
:
e thing here, as t
he Jefferson Airplane bass-player was:  I was sitting in a car going
 
miles an hour over the freeway with considerable relaxation, and going a hundred th u-
tv'c  f
a '
 r
 if I was putting my maximum physical energy into it.
 
a
, r
ia1 v
,
 
r t's been happening here, I think (
 and one of the thin-s that the
 
-ca f
led Rock Revolution has been saying  to the older g
eneration, which has reacted
 
J such fright and hostility) i
s t
hat the signal system that you're operatinrr on i

omb; you don't have to go out and actually sock somebody in the
 
jam  t
 an5hi1at  h
im, you just do a little-bitty thing .
.. 
and power is in the small, not
 
i the intense. The intense, then, looks feeble in comparison to the small. You've
 
mh n:ed your whole signal system of what it means to be cool (all of the sudden every-
ho y is  very cool; they're reserved--remember, years back, people'd actually talk to o
r

.. I still startle classes b
ecause I
'm of that gen-
ermticn  nd when I get mad I get very vocally mad, and I beat on things and tear thinrs
 
u
n, and this is being recieved in the opposite way: the way suggesting power i
s '
remote-
ness'). And I suspect thot this has had a great deal to do with the extreme r
evulsion
 
ith which the older generation has recieved rock. I mean, fmilies have smu t over i
t,
 
whereas other inputs into the musical system (it's been changing all along; it's bound
 
to change, but not in such a drastic kind of way 
.
.. 
so that your signals get wrong...)....
 
(
(Student mentions rock groups that aren't so loud...)) Of course it's a general-
ization. I don'tthink it completely applies to every rock group, because I don't think
 
t
hat even so
 of the rock people are comfortable with it and I notice a g
reat deal of
 
ambivalence on this question of being cool and not being cool. Coolness for a while was
 
very, very In; it seems to me to have gotten back into a different kind of track.  ut
 
there is something about man up against the machine that makes you feel funny.
 
Another thing I noticed about the Jefferson A
irplane business, when they got
 
through you felt dumb clapping. You know, they'd been making so damn much noise and all
 
you could do was come out with a little old feeble thing (
(claps)). There was a totally
 
innappropriate response, with the result that almost nobody clapped--there'd be t
his
 
sort of nervous thing starting, and then everybody'd go "w, t
he hell with j t
 You know,
 
you can't compete —the machine has really drowned u
s out. There was nothing we could
 
do unless we had a whole bunch of amplifiers on our side. T think it really has...that
 
we have really been through a period of maximum disorganization, and I think that the
 
'
act that r
ock groups are now experimenting with all kinds of "getting into it" and
 
d
-
'
mncing and all t
his kind of business has to do with the fact that you don't change a
 
musical system that easily--I mean, every
- odv g
ets unstrung, and there's going to be
 
some back-and-forth-ness goinc' on.
 
I d
on't present this, pluase understand,  s a theory  just a
s an observation of
 
the kinds of factors that you can at least begin to play around with .
.. 
the level of ob-
servation that I think might be u
seful to you to try to think about. The nice thing
 
about this kind of hypothesis, see, is that it isn't ever going to explain anything b
e-
cause, as I was saying t
he other day, the creative artist i
s not normal--the creative
 
artist has to be abnormal; he doesn't follow the norms of the culture, he moves beyond
 
them in certain dimensions in one way or another. So everything we're looking at in t
erms
 
of individual experimentation, as we're getting with our rock groups over  ll, i
s a
 
little bit off dead center--it's got to be; else, it wouldn't work. So in a way, t
hey've
 
got one foot firmly in dead center and kind of a toe going out like this and trying
 
different kinds of things in all kinds of ramifications of their behavior. So you can
 
see both the center line and the experimentation at the same time.

I want you to get an idea, however, out of this in terms of the existence of
 
culture areas and kind of how the things we've been listening to and talking a
bout re-
late in terms of these three large concepts that I
've been hitting at since the beginning
 
of the semester: things having to do with complimentarity, and people being able to inter-
lock with each other; things having to do with differentiation, and how specialized peo-
ple's activities have to be; an1 things having t
o do wi t
h t
he anount of energy and pow
 
that peoole aut into whatever it is they're doing.
 
Now, if you kind of relate into those three principles, you'll find t at most
 
things begin to kind of meld in together and begin to make a little bit of sense to you.
 
Each individual society will have a different and elegant (
 in the mathn
'
.atical sense of
 
'
.thin these areas. And each one of them will have
 
in their musical system. This gives you a kind o
f an
 
:
ver-look at the whole world in seven pages, which is obviously going to be pretty
 
corn
 lie ated to look at all at one time.

v that,
 
p r
haps, they haven't. They'll start to pull together.
 
We are going to go through three more specific features of the musical perfor-
mance, and t
hen I
'm going to give you some miniature coding sheets with which
 
e
 an
 
olay around, i
f 700 like to do that sort of thing. dometimes, when you look at i
t all
 
in one hunk it i
s easier than it is to talk about t
hem seperateiy.  nd :
re,  so far,
 
have been listening to different features, and we haven't been putting them together
 
into chunks. So we'll olay with that a little bit before the end of the semester--how
 
to olt them into chunks. Then, we'll be doing a final exercise, which I
 think you'll
 
find very exciting, of taking a complete Cantometric training sheet, and identifying
 
a oarticular song out of it .
.. 
which I t
hink will make you feel that you reatl\r have
 
finally g
ot somewhere out of all this mess.
 
Put first we have to think very briefly aaout a cau te of more f
ratures of song
 
performance, and I
'm just going to pl y you a bit of a s
a  '
le of this one: ia has to
 
do with the differentiation factor, but it also has to do with the individual singing
 
o
erforrnance, so for ne e
r
'ioti ially, it fits in here '
rere we've been t
kinc ab ut
 
voice quality.
 
It is the de ree of eabeilishment that a sinner OUtb  into a musical  e
3TTfanaa.
 
This, by the way, is also often reflected in the instrumental music of a society too:
 
you can have instruments played with and without a great deal of embellishment,  enendiog
 
on, of course, the instrument. —there's not much you can do to embellish a rattle or a
 
clicking stick, but by the time you get up to violins, you c
an either play them ,
sirai:ht
 
on or you can put in all kinds of trills and curlicues.

imbellish m

you have lots of embellishment you will probably not have a great deal of blendy-ness
 
within your singing style when more than one person sing together.They are apt to em-
bell sh in various ways, right?, because it is pretty individualistic. So these things
 
begin to sort of groan together: you cn have some rasniness with some degree of blend,

(
Question regarding the correlation of '
energy' and '
embellishment'.)) Thct's
 
ting. I
'll have to find out whether there's any correlation between this energy
 
factor and embellishment. It would seem to me that in order to put it in you would have
 
to have a little mor pow. But it's hard to do--you might try just singing plain to your-
self and then singing with embellishment to yourself--you have to have a lot more wind,
 
and it's more difficult singing in g
eneral.
 
The only t
hing I know about it for sure is that it has very high co-occurance
 
with complex societies and the other...the kind of situation in which solo-explicit
 
performance is a feature of the culture. And to that extent, I should think aggression
 
would be one of the factors, certainly individualism 
.
.. and you're dominating the com-
munication.
 
(
(Student makes long, inaudible comment.)) This paper--I didn't g
et to explain
 
it much yesterday--but the chart that he's referring to is the result of factor analris
 
operations performed on all of the data used in the entire experiment. That is, all o
f
 
the musical features, all of the cultural features, all of the information from a 0
-ira-
ilel study of dance and a parallel study of  ara-liguistic f
eatures that has been going
 
on. And what the computer did, in effect, was t
o sort out of all of t
hese data all of
 
these things that a related to each other. I
'm not clear about factor analysts myself,
 
but I gather that it's like you had a whole table of things like here; now, you could
 
sort these into piles according to various characteristics (
"this is more like this
 
than it is like that"; "This tape recorder is more like this tape recorder than it is
 
like that notebook there", and so we could make a tentative nile of tape recorders and
 
a tentative pile of notebooks--now where would the newspaper go?---well, i
t's more like
 
the notebook than it is like the taperecorder...). It's a question of sorting similari-
ties out--looking at it in all different kinds of ways. And t
hat's about Ps far as I
've
 
been able to understand it.
 
I
s the cup more like the t
ape recorders than like the notebook?  ell, that d
epends
 
on if you're thinking of it as a paper cup, you see. It's got three-dimensi na1ity,
 
which is like the tape recorders... So amongst these, you come u
p with a variety of cata-
gories of things that are kind of like each other.
 
(
(Long, inaudibel student comment.)) That's right. ExactlyL And that's the way
 
to look at a
ll of these things: that this is one perspective, and a different perspect-
ive will show you a different thing. It doesn't mean that the over all perspective, and
 
that the close perspective is right--it depends on the kind of thing you are looking for
 
within your particular look at the material.
 
This is what knowledge is all about, you know: sorting things out. I may have
 
mentioned to you before a statement made by an anthropologist .
1 once heard speaking,
 
who said that he felt that the first thing Early Man did was begin to arrange things in
 
piles...The second thing he said Early Man dtd was to look for someone outside his f ail -
ily to marryl And I think they're arranged in exactly the right order--everywhere you
 
find catagories; it's a pan-human trait. Everybody catagorizes. And that's they way we
 
u
nderstand things, is by catagorization. And almost everywhere in the world you find
 
exogomy---apparently these are the two m a i n  things that make human beings human beinis.
 
So the nature of the piling is part of the information. But as I was explaining
 
in my F Jklore class this morning, if you take, s y, a groun of su erstition
.  (
"If you
 
drop a fork on the floor, company i
s co;aing"; "
If the shadow of the tree falls towards
 
the East, it is going to be a long winter"; or "
If a bird flies in -t
he window, it i
s a
 
sign of death")...If you take a bunch of t
hose, you can sort them out according to
 
what the result is---"company i
s coming", "
somebody dies", "the winter i
s long"
and then
 
you can put all the ones that have to do with weather in one pile, Ini all of the ones
 
that have to do with company coming in another nile, and all of the ones that have to
 
do with death in another pile. And then you can see something interesting: how many
 
things in a particular repertoire are concerned with death; how many things are concerned
 
with the weather; and so on. On t
he other hand, you can just as well sort them accord-
ing to the nature of t
he substance involved:
 '
birds";  kitchen u
tensils'--and
 
you can find a whole bunch of beliefs.
 
Though you've sorted the same material, you 've got different information out of
 
it. Then, suppose instead of that, you look at the verbs: "dropping something", "flying
 
somewhere", t
casting a shadow"--and divided those into nhysical ncts, or things t
hat a
 
person can do themselves, or things that just happen
—or any of the other possible ways
 
you could divide them. That would be just as r
easonable a way, and you would learn some-
thing else.
 
So, every way you look at the material, you get additional information...and that's
 
what sorting and catagoriation is all about. It's just as sinøle-minded as that.
 
(
(TAPE))
 (
("Song lO"...))
 
OK. I think we've got "
embellishment" pretty well now, and I
'd like to take a
 
few minutes to start on a slightly trickier one. This one has to do with melodic form.
 
(
The Cantonietrics people tell me that they're not u
sing t
his particular tape any
 
more because they think it is too complicated. But I t
hink you're smart enough to take
 
it, and I happen to like it —it's a fun tape to listen to.)
 
It has to do with melodic form, and I
've already told you, in connection with
 
her things, the three major forms of melody t
hat everybody r
ecognizes: littony,
 
u
rophe, and through-composed.
 
When you boil right down to it, t
he distinctiof
l between these forms i
s really,
 
essentially, length---or to out it another way, the number of phrases involved. One ind
 
two-phrased melodies are norn 1ly counted under '
littany'. Three to eight phrases are
 
normally counted '
stror)he'. And beyond eight is normally '
through-composed'.
 
If you keep this sort of in the back of your head, the distinctions between the
 
three forms we have here will, I think, be fairly easy for you. What the Cantometrics
 
people are now doing is simply have the people count the number of Dhrases in the tune,
 
instead of trying to decide whether it's littany, strophe, or through-composed, but I
 
think it's more interesting to think about these overlaosituations between littanv
 
and strophe which are kind of interesting and fun.
 
So we're going to tackle it this way.  u
t you can t
hink of i
t just in t
his kind
 
of simplistic way: how many phrases make un  a tune, before it starts to get repeated?
 
That's really all we're listening for.
 
(
(TAPE))
 (
(Melodic Form Training Tape))
 
(
(Following Level 1
...)) Now, that was simply alternatin , r
ight? 3o you had one
 
phrase and then you had the other phrase (you had A. B, A, B
, A
, B, A, B. etc.). Yo
 
can get variation in here; some people don't just say the same two phrases over again
 
in the same order. You can get somebody singing: A, A, A, A, A
, A, B
, A
, A, B
, A
, A, j
R--
or variations on this. So that i
s simply one form of littany.

Now that is t

I dont know if you've ever had the experience of runnin  into s

belong to a four-line-strophic society--but it is not the way that an awful lot of peo -
ple g
et their information...and this i
s what's interesting and u
seful to think about.)
 
For a lot of people there is no end, and for a lot of people within the stro ho...
 
When you get up to eight-phrase strophe you are going to find that it's a lot more com-
plicated, and so a lot more things can go on within this T
ittle package. It's difficult
 
to listen to; it's difficult to understand.

I was marking phrase-endings for you. Thrase-endings are, literally, where t
he
 
singer stops to take a breath. The interesting thing about that was you notice that the
 
phrases were not all of identical length--some of them went far longer than others.
 
You can have equal-length phrasing, as you did in Little Rosewood Casket where every
 
case was of the same length, or you can have every phrase of it's o
wn l
ength, whir:
 
t
hat you have here.
 
But what you r
eally should start to try to listen to i
s, where d
id the phrase
 
stop? This is the only way you can count phrases, you see, and this i
s what we're coing
 
to have to be doing in connection with this--counting phrases and seeing when repetition
 
occurs, if it o
ccurs.
 
(
(Student suggests that the s
econd phrase was just an embellished r
epetition of
 
the first phrase.)) 1
7ell, I didn't hear that, but maybe we should listen to that a
 :
ain.
 
If
 repetition then you've got something else happening. Remember the narrator
 
talked, though, ab ut an evolving melody.. .
and I don't think f
,
her'e was literal repetiti:n
 
in the sense that we've heard it before. Ordinarily you will find a high co-occurrance
 
of elaboration of your sin ing style with through-cor
rnosed. Through-composed,  r
o ' ii
 
be pleased to hear (because I find that most people find it hard to listen to), i
s
 
extremely rare. You don't find a lot of through-composed. Strophe and littany are the
 
two big occurances and they're the most interesting also, because they give you all
 
kinds of speculations of structures that people are putting on the world.
 
(
(Student asks if through-composed is the style of most epic songs an  tales?
 
Yes. It's almost confined to solo singing, for obvious reasons. Nobody knows where a
 
through-composed guy is going in advance. (
(STUDENT: Is there much improvisation in
 
through-composed?)) Enormous amounts. In fact, that's probably what it really is: total
 
improvisation...which suggests that t
here is no structure being applied at all, except
 
that time and events are being viewed as a stream, in effect .
.. 
which is an interesting
 
way to think about things, and one which we find it very hard to tolerate because we
 
don't really l
ike it. It's like my paper with no paragra hs

In the Cantometrics coding they make a lot of tight distinctions between various

I thought, having talked about all this stuff for so long, you might be interestcd

his study has been based (
(hand-outs) .
 
I thought you would be interested in seeing an actual Cantometrics coding sheet. This
 
is, however, not a single t
ime being coded here; this i
s a 1
i p ng-to ether of a number
 
of pieces of material.
 
It looks rather formidable, but it is r
easonably simple. Let me explain briefly
 
how this works. (
(Explanation of coding process and symbols.))
 
Now, if you compare the two (
(Africa and Europe, Modal t
>rofiles)), you can s
ee
 
that for the first twelve i
tens t
here is really significant distinction i
n ',he pa tern
 
between Europe and A
'rica.  frica tends t
o be way over to the right, and Furope tends
 
to be way over at the left...with a kind of a
n odd-ball little pattern t
hat's indicated
 
here with dots, t
hat indicates a very specialized group within the European profile
 
that do a great deal of polyphonic singing. We've heard t
his in some of the Central
 
European and Balkan music...but in  eneral, you g
et an awful l
ot of '
solo-exr,liclt' klnis
 
of stuff coming out in Europe.
 
So by comparing these profiles, y
ou can notice some very interesting and distinct-
ive things about style. Are there any parameters you would like me to explain? I thin"-
you could r
ead a lot of them...I mean, you sort of know what they are;
 )U might not
 
know how they are defined.
 
(
(Question r
egar f
tn  number of possibilities under 'elodic Form'.)) .
...As I told
 
you, they are coded very carefully in the over-all Cantometric thing; all I wanted y
ou
 
to do was get a g
eneral idea of the grouping. If you notice down here, there is also
 
a coding for the number of phrases (Line 18) in which y
ou code for '
8 or more phrases' ) 
'-7 phrases', '

(Question regarding '

(
(STUDENT: 'T
hat's rubato?)) Rubato is a type of rhythm which i
s more a1li ned
 
to speaking than to a regularized kind of meter or beat. It is sometimes referred to,
 
actually, as 'rubato parlando', which means '
speaking rhythm'. Everyone has a certain
 
nt of rhythm in t
heir speech, actually, but it's not •
a rhythm that comes out in
 
m r1cal, measurable numbers.
 
Some societies sing a great deal like this. To give you an exa mple that you might
 
have heard, there ar  a lot of opera arias in which a guy explains what he is going to
 
do, or where he has just been, or something, and it comes out kind of like he was talk-
ing only it's sung. And that is rubato. Tt  i

in that case it's '

the pinched, narrow, squeezed voice to the very wide, and ooen-throated singing tone
 
of swiss yodelers.  e talked about that a little bit but we didn't really try for it
 
in t
esting.
 
I think the i
nteresting thing here is t
o observe how distinctive these profiles
 
are, in terms of variation--"What is stressed?". You can see, if you read the smell
 
print d ri below, the kinds of stylistic observati ns y
ou c
an make by looking at these

This is the profile of a particular song--an individual song-- which  -
 noticed
 
was printed in the (
(Cantometrics)) book. This is, in other words, an example o
f the
 
raw data that the Cantometrics testers prepared.
 
The thing that struck me as intriguing about it is that it is of a single song...
 
and I happen to have the record that was u
sed. On the other hand, if you notice down
 
at the bottom in the small print, it says that this i
s a Formosan song, and there i
re
 
five or six songs on the record which are from Formosa. So our job is going to be to
 
work backwards, looking at the profile, and decide whether it could '
oply or not to the
 
six songs, and which one it applies to.
 
So we will be working exactly backwards. You will
, have a description in front of
 
you and you will, then, have to determine whether the music matches the description, be-
cause there are on this recording... You see, :
1 don't even know which  one this is my-
self. (
(STU)ENT: Doesn't it give the name of t
he song?)) No. It does give t
he name of
 
the tribe, but there are quite a few pieces done by this tribe. I don't know which one
 
it is .
.. so it's al
l up to u
s to determine.
 
There are six selections from Formosa on this particular recording. I can read
 
you what the r
ecord album notes say, but that, again, won't help particularly in deciding
 
which song this is a profile of. Now, if you notice over here on the right, you have the
 
circles of the particular code. If you want the code translated, I could give it to you...
 
notice in the left hand column there is the circle with the line through it (which i
s
 
theta) and that means '
absent', so you can sort of start fiturIng out right now for
 
'irs lf what this is going to have  to sound like.
 
Let's try one and see.

T,ass: "

hy?...  It's supposed to be soci l un-

with a theta, indicating that it doesn't have any orchestra with it. It's a s
olo song...
 
Did you notice any other place where i
t might be different... Yeah, i
t did have a ood
 
bit of a
ccent, t

itive
 
itive. It hai a fair amount of words in it--I would have rated it "
extremely wordy"
 
or "wordy", though I might have wanted to listen to it a couple of t
imes to he sure.
 
ut it was between those two...
 
So, OK, it isn't that one. (
Th:it was sung in the Chinese language, by the ,

and was a tea-picking song, or a song about tea-picking, being o
ccorpanied here by  n

OK. Let's try number two.

 (
It's not alternation.)...  That, my friends, is interlocki They
 
were all singing different things at the same time. (
(RECORDING RE P

few places in the world where you find interlock; it's one of the oldest forms in the
 
world and here we have..."The singers belong to one of the smallest, most isolated, and
 
most sva e of all Formosan tribes. They may he a sub-group of the nearby -
 tribe,
 
which has lins with the head-hunting groups of nearby islands, but it seems to be more
 
likely that the Tsai Tset (
(???))..." that these people--they're welcoming t

by the way in the song  .
..are a remnant of aboriginal population. In their race apoeirs

...and it may be of real significance
 
that the Tsai Tset (
(???)) are the only group on the Island  that construct it's songs
 
in the form of rounds, a characteristic of pygmoid music in Africa and India as well.
 
The Tsai Tset also play the jaw-harp and the musical bow..." these very, very ancient
 
and early forms of musical instruments.
 
So I would score that interlock... I v

ETHNOLOGICAL MUSIC  -

 LECTURE /
/ 6
 (
Wednesday, February 28)
 
Ethnomusicaologists have, quite naturally, been very interested in this
 
question of tone l
anguages versus stress languages, because they felt, very
 
logically, that there would be some relationship between the musical styles
 
and the linguistic styles. The only problem i
s that it is very difficult to find
 
out exactly what it is. Most of the studies, that I have seen, of attempts to
 
investigate the question of whether people with tone linguages have different
 
musical systems than people who speak in stress languages, have been very in-
conclusive. This is probably because, as I pointed out to you last time, the
 
important thing to remember is that all languages use both tone and stress, and
 
the division is not terribly clear between the two. The more linguist find out,
 
the more they find out that there i
sn't as neat a package of division, as sharp
 
adividing line, as u
sed to be thought.
 
There still are languages in which tone is more crucial, in  terms of de-
erL.ining meaning, than in other languages where stress seems to be more crucial
 
r
i terms of determining meaning. Both are always present--and be sure you remember
 
at; both stress and tone appear in all languages, as meaningful parts of the
 
communication sys te m.
 
But it is a very subtle and tricky problem area, and a lot of studies that I
 
have seen kind of come up with, in a discouraged way at the end, and say there is
 
not very much that you can s
ay about the relationship between tone to musical
 
system, as far as an individual society is concerned.
 
There has recently been published a new study, by a fellow nasied John Black-
ing, called '
Venda Children's Songs'. I really-cannot tell you what it says be-
cause I
'm still hacking away at it, however--as I u
sually Jo--I went over and read
 
the end of it first. It seems to me that he is coming up woth some very interesting
 
conclusions, and I w
ant
 to look through and find out how he is doing this. He
 
started off...the Venda, by the way, live in South Africa; he is a South A'rican
 
ethnomusicologist and anthropologist who has studied the Venda people for a long
 
time (they are c
lassified, normally, as people having a tone language).
 
In his work with the Venda P he became interested in their children's music,
 
because he felt...it seemed very different, to him, from adult music; ordinarily
 
one sort of assumes that there will be a kind of continuity between the children's
 
music and the adult music. So, he became interested, then, in investigating the
 
chidren's music per se, to see if it was sort of based on any kind of different
 
principles than the adult style. Now, as I say, I have not read the book in great
 
detail, so I can't tell y
ou exactly about how he went about all that he d
id, and
 
so on and so forth; I am still back in t
he ethnography part. But in general, he
 
appears to conclude that his total perceptions were in error--that, by the time
 
he gets through analyzing the musical content and the musical features of Venda
 
children's music, he has determined--or his analysis indicates--that there is
 
indeed a continuum between the adult and children's traditions. It is the sort
 
of surface features that are different; in terms of structural relationships, they
 
are very, very similar. He feels that it is very plainly proven that, at least in
 
the case of the Venda, t
he rules of tone that apnly in speech are being u
sed in
 
the musical system.
 
This is, I think, one of the biggest studies on this particular problem
 
that I have yet come across--the others have been much more brisk kinds of ex-
aminations —so that I can't report very much more to you than that. It is one of
 
the problems that is yet to be explored; every once in a while I like to bring
 
in some problems that we're not very sure about, because I think students o
c-
casionally get the idea that everybody knows everything in the world--it' s just
 
that we won't tell you because we want you to have the horrible agony of going
 
through the experience of finding it out. The actual fact of the matter is that
 
there are a tremendous number of things that we don't know, and most people
 
would be perfectly delighted to tell you...if we had the answers. So if it is
 
an  r
insw
o q
uestion, every once in a #iile I like to bring it in.
 
The other r
eason r
 wanted to mention it is that it suggests that there are
 
levels of music that are not immediately perceptible; that there are certain kinds
 
of underneath qualities, in a musical system, that are either there or not
 
there, that may not be what you immediately focus on.  ost of u
s think of music
 
in a rather limited kind of a way; and we think of it as being extremely change-
able--not only changeable, but that it exists in infinite variety within any
 
single system. (
This is) because most of the time we are concentrating on the
 
surface features rather than on the underneath features. If you look at the under-
lying construction of most musical systems, you f
ind that, on t
hat level, they
 
are extremely conservative; they do not change very much. To give you an example,
 
melody is very flexible, and very moveable; you can observe this for yourself in
 
the fact that tunes can be played in a number of different kinds of ways. Tunes
 
can move from one style to another, and those of you who have traveled abroad
 
may have heard, say, American tunes being played by Japanese orchestras, or
 
Balanese orchestras, or French orchestras, or what have you, and it is very clear
 
that they have learned the tune but they haven't adopted the style —it still
 
sounds a little more Japanese than it sounds American. So, there i
s some kind of
 
permenancy somewhere in the musical system: a Japanese child singing '
Mary Pad
 
A Little Lamb' will not be mistaken for an American child singing '
Mary Had A
 
Little Lamb'; there will be something going on there--although she will be singing
 
the same words and the same melody —that makes you realize that this is a Jap-
anese child, or at least that this is a non-Western tradition child singing.
 
This says, t
hen, that there is more to music than the tune and words of a
 
song--and indeed there i
s. And it also suggests, that whatever else there is
 
more than tune and words. • .
and we are not used to thinking this way very much
 
(
I'm just as enculturated as anybody else —I really think that music is tune and
 
)
rds, because that is what we have learned to think of it as). But the total
 
uusical act involves an awful lot more than this, and it is those other features
 
that seem to remain very constant. So, i you look, for instance, at one example
 
of acculturation that's very well known to all of us .
.. that is, in the United
 
States a large number of people from West Arica were imported and located in a
 
at is, their old cultural way of organizing their lives could not be maintained,
 
ei.i  they had to adapt into a cultural pattern that was mostly Western European
 
10 t
he United States).
 
I
here is no getting around the fact that Black people in the United States,
 
in t
ue early part of the last century, learned White tunes. They also learned
 
English, and so they learned English songs along with it. At the same time, they
 
began evolving their own repertoire of these songs, changed around a little bit.
 
It i
s still notable today that you can distinguish--even if you were blind, blind-
folded, and had no other way of knowing except through your ears —you could dis-
.
r
iguish, in any region of the South, a Black congregation singing hymns from a
 
hit  congregation s
inging hymns...they just sound differentL
 
t,,.e
 ­ tyie that a very, very conservative. As a m
atter
 
almost diagram this--what happened here, in a
 
-ry rough sort of way. (
DRAWING ON BOARD) This i
s the British I
sles...and this
 
is Africa (West Africa)...this is the "melting pot"  of the South,of the United
 
ates...and if you have Blacks on one side of the color-line and 1Thites on the
 
other side of the color-line, they have swapped tunes and words back and forth
 
so that there are a lot of songs about which we have no idea, any more, whether
 
1-l e y were Black to begin with or White to begin with. I defy anybody to find out
 
whether '
Careless Love' was originally a Black song or originally a White song--
there's just no way to know. It's sung on both sides of the color-line. Blacks
 
h a VH  l
earned from V
hites, Whites have learned from Blacks; although they have
 
been socially seperate, repertoires have been interchangeable. Yet there are
 
more distinctive f e a t u r e s  linking Southern Whites, in their musical style, with
 
the British Isles, and more distinctive features linking Southern Blacks with
 
'
Vest Africa, than there are between the two--there really are. We will probably
 
take s
ome time out and prove that this semester.
 
There are levels of music which are very, very, very, very conservative, and
 
very, very, very stable; they change only u
nder the most enormous kinds of preas-
sures, whereas the surface l
evels move around very easily. So you have t
his
 
nice blending all the time —this possiblity of creation all the time--because
 
there is both stability and change within the same system.
 
What happens, indeed, when this kind of thing occurs--where you have a strong,
 
vibrant, well-formulated musical style from Africa coming and living next door
 
to and intermingling with a strong, vibrant, exciting, well-defined musical style
 
from the British Isles —is that, instead of borrowing, in a way what begins to
 
happen is, a new style begins to form out of the intermix--this i
s what jazz
 
came out of. This is something you should bear in mind, because I think that
 
cople have the idea that culture contact i
s always destructive. It doesn't have
 
o be--it depends on how it happens; it depends on what materials are out in the
 
pot, too. Culture contact may make things happen; may make innovation possible;
 
may make the invention of new and exciting musical systems happen.  I think this
 
is why our centers of creativity, in t
he New World, for new musical styles have
 
been New Orleans (which was the big melting pot ir a of the Northern Hemisphere)
 
and Central Mexico (which had so many Indians, of various types, and Europeans
 
marching back and forth through it — t
here '
s where you g
ot another explosion of
 
creativity, in the form of Mexican mestizo styles).
 
What we're going to be concentrating on, then, this semester, i
s not sur-
face content but underneath content--the stability elements that we don't normally
 
focus on. This may be a little difficult for you for a little while, because we
 
aren't u
sed to thinking in these terms; but there are a nu her of ways in which
 
this can be gotten at.
 
How do you go about doing it? Well, we are going to follow a pattern t
hat
 
has been set in terms of an extensive experimental study (
of which we are an
 
experimental part, by the way--the data from this class will be fed in with the
 
data from other college classes where this system i
s being taught, to find out
 
its strong features, its weak features, etc.). It is a system that has been de-
vised in an attempt to look at the u
nderlying features of the musical expressive
 
system, to determine what they are, and--more importantly---to figure out a non-
culture-centered way of talking about it.
 
How are you g
oing to do that
? That's a very difficult job
  
Indeed, it may be almost i
i
:
.possible. I
'm not oven sure thatthis system, as
 
good as I think it is, has gotten to that point. But there is no way to sort of
 
know until you test it out extensively--this is part of the process that we're
  
involved in: testing it out.
 
In the first place, you have to start by not listening to American music, but
 
listening to the music of the world. You have to collect a sample; and this study is
 
the result of a collection of samples of music recorded by ethnographers and field-
workers, of music in--as far as possible--non-formal, non-performance situations. That
 
i
s, where possible, t
he music was recorded by people who were living in v1
11 ges, not
 
by, say
.
,  the Bulgarian Folk Ensemble .,
 but by Bulgarians...in villages. (
In my Amer-
can Folk Music course I tell them, "We're going to be listening to the people that
 
Joan Baez learned her songs from, and then she makes them a little bit different whcn
 
she performs them on t
he stage.) This is not a value judgement--the stage material
 
can be extremely beautiful and can communicate, cross-culturally, perhaps better, but
 
if you want to find out what Bulgarians sound like you don't go and listen to the Bul-
garian National Orchestra; you go and listen to Bulgarians — and the same way around
 
the world.
 
The first thing, then, was to collect a sample; and the sample that was used here
 
was some 233 cultures from around the world. This i
s not, you understand, all the
 
cultures in the world; this was as many as could be gotten at, put it that way. There
 
are an awful lot of places in the world where nobody has bothered to record their
 
music .
.. 
even field workers. There are a lot of peoples in the world that we just don't
 
know anything at all about yet; although this seems kind of improbable, it happens to
 
be the case in a few areas. So, the sample was weak in certain parts of the world where
 
not very much work had been done.
 
The data benk, then, consisted of field recordings, not transcriptions; no work
 
was done from transcribed sources at all--what you had to do was listen to the music.
 
hw, I
've -
)E--3n trying to give you a t
heoretical basis for understanding why listening
 
to msuic i
s all r ht to do without writing it down. The problem, then, i
s how are
 
you going to talk about it?
 
The idea was to talk about it in t
erms of factors which the ordinary, every-
day ear could percieve, on the theory —as I said the first day I came into t
he room--
that music is made for ordinary people to listen to, not for music specialists. The
 
specialization, then, comes in with not the listening but how you are going to talk
 
about what you're listening to. Everybody can hear it; the question is: what are you
 
going to call it? Since, then, the basic job is to divide this musical experience
 
into a whole sequence of musical traits, the question is not only what to call the
 
trait  but. • .
that is, is it present? is it absent? This is very easy with some of
 
them; for instance, is there an orchestra?--either there's an orchestra or there
 
isn't. This i
s a very simple kind of a question, and this way of going at music i
s
 
based on equally simple questions. "Is there anq orchestra? I
sn't there an orchestra?
 
If there is an orchestra, what is it doing? Does it play in between  he s
ingers?
 
Does it play while the singers are singing?"...Mow, you could tell that. There are
 
all kinds of simple minded questions of this nature that are asked.
 
But, eventually you get to all kinds of qualities that are .
.. involve some kind
 
of measurement. How are we going to measure? For instance, suppose you wanted to say
 
that music Is soft or loud (that's a perfectly good thing to say). Rock is, very
 
clearly, loud--it just i
s (at least hard rock). That '
a one of the parts of the music;
 
you've got to say it's loud. But, how loud is loud? We already mentioned that t
his
 
was going to be a problem, sometime back, and I pointed out to you that there are
 
societies where we figure that, because things are so quiet, there is a very accute
 
kind of hearing, and if this system is going to be any good at all, it has got to be
 
able to be u
sed by other people than just americans. • .
because Americans just don't make
 
music for Americans, and we don't collect music for Americans to listen to, so although
 
we can measure Americans, we have also got to set up some kind of measurement t
hat
 
can be applied to other societies as well.
 
How are we going to think about '
how loud i
s loud'? One way you can do it i
s by
 
sampling all of the musics of the world, from 233 cultures •  You can pull out examples
 
and say '
This is very loud. This i
s about as loud as anybody sings, around the world.'
 
or'This is as loud as anybody plays around the world, and we are going to call this
 
"Very Loud".' Now we could call this '
purple umbrella', if we wantad to; it doesn't
 
matter what you call it, as long as you have it there and you can say '
Now, this is
 
Very Loud'. You can have another sample that says '
This is Very Soft'. There are a
 
lot of people who really sing very softly; you don't hardly hear them. You keep going
 
over and turning up the gain all the time, because they just sort of mumble along.
 
They don't really sing in a kind of assertive way at all. American Indians have a ten-
dency, most of the time, to sing in very loud voices. You can tell this--this is an
 
ordinary human perception. The question is, as I say, what do you call it? Well, i
t
 
isn't as loud as hard rock--it doesn't make your face tingle from the sound waves
 
hitting it; it's not the kind of thing where you have to put cotton in your ears if
 
you're going to go up in front of the loudspeakers--but still it's louder than people
 
who sing 
.
.. (I'm trying to think of a place where people sing very softly; I
've heard
 
a lot of i
t, but I can't remember exact locations. It's u
sually small groups of people
 
:
i r("  not feeling very assertive, as far as I can tell),
 
nyway, there are perceptible degrees, then, and the question is, simply, to de-
cide a kind of general standard, in a pretty simplistic way, of '
We're going to call
 
this kind of thing Very Loud; we're going to call this kind of thing Loud; we're going
 
to call this kind of thing Soft; and we're going to call that kind of thing Very Soft'.
 
And then, all we're doing is identifying by comparison; this is what you do in your
 
head all the time, anyway--this is t
he kind of judgement that you rely upon in most
 
of your activities. You do not bother to take a statistical sampling of the population
 
when you say '
So-and-so is a jerk'--So-and-so i
s clearly a jerk, measured by your stan-
dards of jerkiness, which you have applied from a number of o
ther people, and which
 
are absolutely rational--and which are probably very accuratel It's rather rare that
 
degree
 
you can get into a discussion of '
This is my X
AJJ of jerkiness, as applied to this in-
dividual', and somebody else can say '
But I don't see that in him' but you normal]j
 
find that their standards of jerkiness are different, you see; that's what most people
 
argue about, that's where the argument comes in, is that my definition of jerkiness is
 
different from your definition of jerkiness. But we can all measure the presence of
 
certain qualities in individual behavior. We spend most of our time doing this, and
 
in a funny kind of way, this is what we are going to be doing in this class...making
 
this kind of judgemental opinion which we make all of the time--my problem is to get
 
you to feel that it i
s all right to do it. For a long t
ime you are going to be bothered
 
by feelings of subjectivity; you are going to be ootherod by feelings of being cul-
ture-bound; you are going to be bothered by all kinds of things that everybody has
 
gone around and told you, very vigorously for years and years, are terrible, and you
 
should never do. But none of those people ever t
ell you how not to do them, and I
'm
 
suggesting to you here, that you have to do them--the question is to realize what you're
 
doing, all the time.
 
So, we are going to be a nice bunch of culture-bound, middle class Americans sit-
ting in this room, listening to music, and making culture-bound statements about it.
 
But, we are going to be measuring those against a scale that says '
This is human per-
ception; and the most extreme case of behavior of this kind s0unds like this andthe
 
most extreme case of behavior on the other end of the scale sounds like tb.t, and all
 
you are doing is saying that this sounds more this way than it does that way'. And
 
probably, you will be doing the same thing as an African pygmy was, if he was listening
 
to the same music.
 
This is where, in the next few years I hope, we are going to be able to do some
 
extremely significant cross-cultural experiments. A massive experiment with t
his mat-
erial--this same scaling device —is being carried on now in Italy. A smaller one is
 
going on in the British West Indies, in Trinidad. The Minister of Culture of Trinidad
 
and and Tobago was involved in setting up this system, and he i
s now trying it out in
 
Trinidad, and a smaller version is going in Japan .
.. 
to test whether cross-cultural
 
perceptions are the same where they are put up against a truly cross-culturally deter-
n
ined rating scale (because we are only going to listen to native musical systems, not
 
ajbody else's idea of how they sound, but how t
hey sound) as far as it could human-
ly b brought together.
 
So
, this particular system that we will be investigating (we wond go through the
 
whole system, because we'll be taking excursions into other approaches, occasionally)
 
is called '
Cantometricel (
gtuclent: 13 this a musical system in which you u
se v
oui-
own cultural values as a measuring stick?)'
­lot u
sing your own cultural values--
you'r going to be given a scale with which to measure against; we'll start playing
 
with this in just a few minutes. Now, what '
cantometrics' says, is measurement of
 
song: canto-metrics, and this is exactly what we're g
oing to be doing, in effect:
 
measuring the presence or absence of qua1ities in not only song, but in music in
 
general...that i
s, we will also be taking up orchestras and so on.
 
There are a few things I want to say t
o you before we begin just to clear the
 
air and give you some notion about how to pursue this further, if you should choose
 
to.  e won't be just doing this in this class —
'we'll be doing various other things--
but we have been asked to feed data into the cantometrics data bank, and so from
 
time to time we will be doing that, and by the end of the semester you may be getting
 
a print-out of how you rate, in a sense how you score, in terms of all the other peo-
ple who are trying out this experiment around various parts of the world. This i
s a
 
kind of interesting thing to find out about yourself, if nothing else...(student:wjll
 
they be listening to the same music...) Umhmrn. So they will be listening to the same
 
music and coming up with the same opinions--now, your opinion is your opinion, and
 
you can just hang in there with it, but it becomes very interesting to find out that
 
you don't think exactly the same way as a lot of other people .
.. or that you do. Either
 
way it comes out, you find out an awful lot about yourself and your own perceptions.
 
There are some areas in which people have tremendous consensus; the whole world says
 
'
Amen'. It's very exciting, I think, to find out that everybody hears the same thing,
 
as far as we can tell. In certain other areas, there is an awful lot of cultural
 
static that comes in the way; and that's very interesting, too...to find out that
 
some people hear something different than we hear. This is going to be really fascin-
ating. Even if you find out that you hear a little bit differently from the other guys
 
in the room, there's no law that you've got to (hear the same). Hang in there 1 You can
 
be together and you can be different at the s
ame time. Again, this i
s a very ex-
citing concept to have.
 
Now, I must tell you that the system itself i cxperiiental. The study, which comes
 
out of Columbia University has been going on for about eight years, and eight years
 
is a short time any kind of new approach accepted; so the ethnomusicology meetings,
 
and the anthropology meetings, and linguistics meetings, and communications meetings,
 
are apt to have very hot sessions on the degree to which cantometrics works. That's
 
fun, too; it's kind of fun to be on the edge of the exploring of knowledge. However,
 
after thinking about it for a long time, I decided that I wanted to teach this sys-
tem because it is not simply a discovery of the guys who made it u
p--they are u
sing
 
concepts that have been used by ethnomusicologists ever since the beginning. The v-
eabulary- is the same, some of the ideas are the same...this i
s just a way of testing
 
them. So whether you become convinced that this is a superb system, or not, you will
 
still be learning an enormous number of concepts that will be helpful to you if you
 
ever want to go on, in terms of ethnomusicology. The system has this built-in advan-
tage, I think, in teaching that you are learning the same kinds of things you would
-
be learning in a slightly different perspective in another kind of ethnomusicology
 
course.
 
The next thing to tell you is that the system was essentially developed, and is
 
.
eing essentially pursued, by my brother, Alan Lomax. The book that he wrote, which
 
ssentially explains the system is one of the books that I reccommended you look at
 
and it's on reserve. It is a very hard nut to crack; I suggest you not go
 
til after I
've had a few days of easing you into it. As Alan put it to me
 
when we were discussing why that book was so damned hard to read, he said
 
read it an-
one day,
 
"
The prob-
lem is that it is almost totally dense; in the sense that when I as working on i
t,
 
I really, put everything I know in that book .
.. I mean, everything I know. So that each
 
sentence is just loaded full of information, and that makes it very hard to read."
 
On the other hand, once you've had a little introduction to it, you can play around
 
*
ith it, I think, and get quite a lot out of it. So I encoura e you to take a look...
 
f you like this kind of approach and find it stimulating.

 ) break
 
down the musical act__the musical act, in terms of cantometrics, has o
een broken
 
down into 37 parameters; we will not consider all 37, because it turns out that
 
some of them are very important, and some of them don't seem to be very important.
 
What do I mean by '
very important'?
 
There is another feature of the Cantometric study that I haven't mentioned to
 
you; and that is, that all 233, in terms of their cantometrics analysis, have been
 
fed into computers containing all of the parameters that we know about abD t these
 
people's social system, to see if there is any degree of correlation between presence
 
or absence of a musical trait, and presence or absence of a cultural trait. The ma-
chines have whirred and whirred, and spit u
p correlations,  i
nd sometimes nothing seems
 
at which point the hypothesis has been that maybe this isn't
 
of musical systems or it ought to have something to say
 
about something in the world. We will be going over only the most critic;l; that is,
 
the things that seem to have very close correlations with o
ther kinds of human be-
havior 
.
.. 
and when I
'm talking about '
other kinds of human behavior', I
'm talking about
 
every aspect of the social system that we know anything about: soc i
al organization,
 
political organization, sex roles, socialization of children, other forms of expres-
sive behavior, mythologies, types of religious belief...everything we know about these
 
233 peoples has been coded in. So when you get a correlation that a pears to be fairly
 
close, you may have found out something about the way in which society organizes it-
self and how music, as an expressive system, as a communication system, fits the par-
ticular society that is doing it. This to me is one of the most moving discoveries
 
that I hive ever made personally: that everybody's song style fits; that the way oeo-
pie make music really says something fundamental about the kinds of human beings there
 
are. Thus, as we can appreciate human variety, we can also appreciate musical variety,
 
because they are parts of the same thing. People are, when they make music, celebrating
 
themselves, and this is why it doesn't change very fast,..because, if you are an Ara-
paho, by damn, you like being an Arapaho .
.. 
and that's really what you want to talk
 
about; this is also why
- music is so emotionally powerful--effectively, it has to do
 
with your easeline social identity and group.
 
I
'm afraid that we don't have much time to do more than just play around a
 
bit, at this time. We're going to start off with a kind of an interesting concept
 
that I find people find is a sort of nice thing to start with, because everybody is
 
comfortable with this; that is, the linguistic end of it. You see, we're big talkers,
 
as I said before, and we are, then, very comfortable when we think about language.
 
It's pretty obvious, in terms of what I was saying the other day, that some people
 
do a lot of repeating and some people do a lot of non-repeating. When you start t
o
 
teach, the experienced professors will come up L
a you and say  ?
ell, you know, it's
 
iLke the old saw says: What you do is you tell '
em you're going to tell '
em...and
 
then you tell '
em... and then you tell '
em you told '
em!" Why do they have to tell
 
you this? Because It is very typical of new teachers to tll you all new things, on
 
on and on and on and on and on; it's very typical of new teachers in Western
 
culture, because we always want to go on and tell you something different--we don't
 
.
ike to say the s
ame thing. One of the tricks of teaching is to learn how to say
 
he same thing differently, because we don't like to repeat, very much. I think you
 
can tell that in our song style; you can tell that we u
se a lot of words. Think about
 
the popular songs that you know 
.
.. 
they may have a refrain line that you come back to,
 
or maybe even a little chorus (
like '
Hey, Jude') but basically you want a lot more
 
information in your songs. It would be very unlike Americans to produce a song that
 
goes "Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah...." but it is very like Pawnee; I mean,
 
the Pawnee are really turned on by that kind of a song--they really, really like i
t,
 
and that's mostly the way a lot of Amerindian songs are. They like to repeat; they
 
like to u
se the same words over and over and over again. As a matter of fact, we are
 
going to hear at some point a recording of Moslems praying to Allah, and they say
 
"
Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah..." at the top of their voices--th ese great male shouts
 
coming out--and after two or three minutes of it, it g
ets...you're just like this.
 
It's really tight; it's a very exciting effect. But it certainly isn't anything that
 
we would do in church; l
Ye have to g
et involved in "Blessed be the tie that binds/ The
 
hearts in Christian love/The fellowship of kindred mind/Is like to that above". . . I
 
mean, that's a lot of words to get out. And we don't z
et to go back to it very
 
often--that's why we have to have hymn-books, because nobody can
 all o
f
 
those words; you have to sit there and look at them.
 
So this i
s the first dimension that we are going 1
.0 be playing with: "no people
 
like to repeat, or do they not like to repeat", just in terms of the words; t
hen
 
we'll find out that there are patterns of repeating in terms of tunes 4 ferent.
 
You see, we are going to be extrapolating, we are going to be moving out with little
 
pieces of the song message and look at those, and then we can add them all up and have
 
a picture of what the song style is like.  eople w
ho r
epeat a l
ot with t
i dr words
 
may be doing long, comp licated tunes, or they may never r
ep-at t
heir orchestral pat-
terns
—there are all kinds of variations that are possible.
 
That's what we'll start working on next time, and we'll see how well you f
it in
 
with the rest of humanity, as far as  r
e have sanpied it.

learning to pick out and recognize certain aspects of t
he EU;ical s
ituation
 
which we'll be dealing with, in future, in rather lar e quart.
r
 e have to do t
hem
 
one at a time because it's easier that way, but next Monday I
'll be giving you your
 
assignments for which particular people you'll be working with on your own. Then
 
you'll have to go it alone for a bit. I want to explain t
he rationale behind t
his
 
assignment of listening to t
he music so early in the semester, and trying to cope
 
with it yourself.
 
I deliberately set it u
p so that you will have the experience of listening to
 
one people's music for a fairly sizable period of time quite early in the semester,
 
before you have a lot of instructions of how to do it, because I want you to have the
 
experience kind of plain--unstructured by any additional system superimposed. So then,
 
when you come back to it at the end of the semester, you will find yourself--In the
 
first place, I suspect —pleasantly surprised by how much you were able to do without
 
having a particular system to work with; in other words, it will confirm the kinds of
 
things I
've been telling you about what ordinary, perceptive human beings get out of
 
music. In the s
econd place, you will be interested by the number of things that you
 
knew were thec'e, but that you didn't think to remark on; in other words, you are not
 
hearing any-t
hing new, you are isolating things that are new out. This seems to be a
 
very common kind of experience that people have during the semester, and it's worth
 
the time, if only to convince you of your ability, at the beginning, to handle this
 
experience. I
'll discuss this at greater length next time, when I actually g
ive you
 
the assignments, but t
he .
.. I don't grade these papers, in the formal sense; I find that
 
I do things like '
check, check-plus, check-minus', because every once in a while some-
body has just obviously just knocked themselves out, and done a superlative job, and
 
I like to give you some feed-back that I recognize it; and every once in a while some-
body has just absolutely and totally goofed off, and isn't putting out the kind o
 
effort that's necessary in order to understand another kind of a culture--it's very
 
hard work--and I also like to g
ive you a signal that I recognize that, too, and we
 
 
i
 
will have to come to some kind of mutual terms on t
his point. But, it's not a
 
serious grade; it's for feed-back. What I do is give you very lengthy evaluations
 
on these papers, so t
hat you have something to go on, and you hang on to them until
 
the end of the semester and then take a
 fresh look at them. . .you' 11 be startled at
 
how much is there. So don't get all of a sweat about the first job being a tremen-
dously important thing, in terms of grading; it's not.  It's an important experience
 
and I
 want you to take it very seriously, but you can use all of the mistaken vacab-
ulary that you want to and it won't be held against you 
.
.. 
you just go at it, and do
 
it any way that you can possibly figure to do it, and I will swing with you. Then,
 
/what
 
as the semester goes along, we'll learn to call all those things that you've been
 
noticing.
 
We are going to start off today thinking about simply one small aspect of the
 
total musical communication, and that is the aspect of the degree of text in a song.
 
Not just the degree of text, but how much information is being carried in the sona
 
text? Some songs have a lot of news in them; everything that's said is a different
 
word. Some songs have a great deal of repetition, in which case there is not very
 
much new information added.There are various degrees in between almost totally wordy
 
(
in the sense of lots and lots and lots of new information being conveyed by the song
 
t
ext) and qlmost totally repetitious. We'll listen to some examples of very high de-
gree of wordiness, of very low degree of wordiness, and some of the sort of mid-points
 
in between, on this tape; then we'll practice making our own opinions and evaluations
 
on this. OK?
 
Now remember that the purpose of these--I refer to them as '
teaching tapes'--is
 
simply to try to set what the possible levels of human behavior are; that is, how
 
wordy can a song possibly be? and how full of repetition can a song possibly be?, and
 
what are some of the mid-points in between?, so that we all agree on them 
.
.. 
we have
 
a check-point of reference. Then we can say t
his is sort of like that one, and this
 
one is sort of like that one. That's all we're doing here; we're not doing anything
 
more complicated than that, and that's a process, as I
've explaLned, that we've all
 
been through before.
 
(
TiAINING TAPE--'wordiness and repetition')
 
That was point five '
extreme repetition'.
 
I
'm going to show you a coding system for t
his, which you can use if you want
 
to--you don't have to, if you don't like to--but it's an easy way to keep track
 
(Writing on board). That was '
extreme repetition'...you don't have to kno
'r that
 
language, do you, to know t
hat he's basically singing "Oyaoyaoyaoy 
.
.. "
; there's
 
not a lot of text, even though there may possibly be words in there. I very much
 
doubt it; I think a one, single kind of cry. Do you want to gu
ess where that's from?
 
That's Amerindian; it's Flathead. It's a Flathead lullaby, based on a melody that
 
the Flatheads tell you they learned from the mourning dove .
.. it's a very pretty lit-
tle tune, isn't it?
 
OK. So that was'extreme repetition'. As I say, this coding idea is just to k
eep
 
you and your
 these things go fairly fast. If you figure your
 
scale goes from '
extremely wordy' to '
extremely repetitious', it's convenient coding
 
to call that '
nonsense'. People, I find, have an aversion to calling it nonsense, but
 
if you think of it in a linguistic sense--that is, no new information is coming in;
 
you're saying either the same thing over again, or you are not saying anything at all--
you can call that '
nonsense', and it makes for a convenient coding 
.
.. 
a mnemonic sort
 
of device. So you can call the first end of the scale 'WO', and the other end of the
 
scale you can call '
NO'; so you have all the way to extreme repetition 
.
.. the problem
 
is that they have turned the  scale around s
ince I learned it, so the ends are differ-
ent. OK, let's hear the other end.

That's old Almeda Riddle. She is a grandmother who lives in }
k
4ountain View, Arkan-
sas —a very, very fine ballad singer...an old friend of mine.
 
It probably doesn't seem fair to you, to give you English as an example to begin
 
i
ith, but notice that, although her tune repeated, her words didn't...right? She was
 
putting a lot of verbal content into that elegant, but fairly brief, tune. The prob-
lem is whether you will be able to recognize the same phenomenon in Russian, or in
 
Bulgarian. or something else.. .

TRAINING TAPE--'Five levels of wordiness/repetition')
 
(Beginning of level three) Now, roiember you are listening to repetition in
 
the text, only...those '
Hieah, hieayah's are what you're focussing on in there
 
or whatever else he's doing in between. Don't pay any attention to the tunes; it's
 
very hard to do this kind of listeninf;
 because you have to throw things out.
 
Just to keep you up with what's going on here: that is an Eskimo song, a sort
 
of magical song that he's doing before a hunting dance.
 
(

Now that's half wordiness and half repetition. (
Student: Is it considered half
 
wordiness and half repetition because the chorus is singing the same text over again...
 
Yes, The guy is putting in a fresh  line of text each time, but the chorns is singing
 
the same l
ine over again, so that's considered half-way balanced.

Would you count that as considerably wordy, di
n you hear the repetition? You
 
heard the repetition...you can recognize it once you start listening for it. That's

eally are a tremendous storehouse
 
of melodic inventiveness.
 
Now, what we are going to do is, we are going to run t
hrough some ones at random

down your opinion, and see if you can stick with it, but we'll talk about each of t

How many said '
extremely wordy'? How many said '
wordy', I mean l
evel four? How
 
many said level three? Half? I think you were decieved by the tune; that's very easy
 
to do. This i
s a strophic melody with a lot of word content. How many said '
nonsensi-
)
 
cal?. —You're not going to  et drawn and quartered over this .
.. Now 
,
 how many
- said
 
'
nonsense'?
 
O. Now we had two here, and how many on '
wordy'?--two here; and then the rest
 
of everybody said...I don't know how many that was, I didn't bother to count...so
 
it would be maybe 25,  roughly. OK, so notice what's happened here: regardless of
 
here you put it, nobody said it was all nonsense .
.. 
nobody said it was mostly non-
sense...you were all down towards this end of the scale, with a very large lumping
 
in one spot. This
 
hearing the music
 
kind of exciting,
 
is about what u
sually happens, and what it means is that you're
 
of the world in very much the way that everybody else does. I
t's
 
I think, that this almost always happens--that everybody pretty
 
much agrees that we're shoving one way or another.
 
Now, that, by the way, was a Norwegian
 
bit of Norwegian, really. Right?

(
SCORING  PROCESS) The same kind of generalized consensus on level three, with
 
ballad 
.
.. so you can understand a
 little
 
a
 
little bit down towards the wordiness; I think the people who were doing i
t down to-
wards the wordy, were putting in that extra guy who came in and zapped around on the
 
top--that's fine. If you were hearing t
hat, and adding it into the total content, that
 
was very perceptive of you. I think that the baseline song underneath, without that
 
whatever it was that was happening, was mid, in a sense; and if you're concentrating
 
on the degree...you see, that's what's nice about u
sing this scale: you can use them
 
to analyze out a total set of circnmjitances. For instance, if that's a feature of these
 
songs, then you would want to put it down here; if that never happens except once, then
 
you would probably score
 
can focus one way or you
 
rant to do that. You can
 
the song here. So when you
 
can focus the other on t

use these, in other words,
 
get a big sample to work on, you
 
underlying song pattern, if you
 
in a whole bunch of very elastic
 
kinds of ways. (
Semi-audible student question...somethjng to do with the impression
 
that this rating scale is "all relative".) That's the point of playing you the scale
 
all the way through at the beginning, because these are degrees of...we are lumping 
here. It's very important to realize, that what you observe depends on where you ob-
serve it from, how far back are you g
etting. We are looking at big
 '
aracteristics
 
from away far back —it is as though we are standing on the moon, or something, and
 
looking at the world —so we are looking at the big parts of t
he outline. T
hat I was
 
trying to suggest to you is that any of these divisions, like this one or this one,
 
could be refined further, if you wanted to concentrate on just one of these aspects;
 
you could narrow it down further and further, if you like —we're taking just a big,
 
gross look now...if that makes sense; I
'm not sure that we're talking about the same
 
thing...that's what's bothering me. (
Student, semi-audible...something to do with
 
the rating of the second and third selections.) You mean, in testing you are affected
 
by the order in which the examples come...? (
Student: Not the order, I
'm just saying
 
the contents...it's very hard to judge, because eighty per cent. of the scale is such
 
a very fine line .
.. I mean, like what's loud? and what's quiet?) RightL That's why we're
 
not drawing a very fine line. (
Student: .
.. 
what I
'm saying i
s t
hat I
'd find it very
 
difficult to be .
.. objective on any single one.) (
Another student: You r
ni ht have
 
trouble —like what he said —you might have trouble distinguishing between say four
 
and five or one and two. Like on the first one, I wasn't quite sure if it was extremely
 
wordy or considerably wordy 
.
.. 
but you can definitely distinguish between...there are
 
like three main things, and four-and-five and one-and-two are very (
homogeneous?). And
 
there you have trouble.)
 
Exactly; what we find when we u
se the scale is that there is lumping, in terms
 
of people's perceptions .
.. 
and that's all we're doing; we're not trying to set up
 
If we wanted, really, to measure the degree of text that's involved in each of these
 
songs, we would have to transcribe every lyric and g
et a phonatition in and he sure
 
that every word was counted 
.
.. and do a statistical survey. 7
Je could do th t, i
f we
 
wanted to. But who's going to bother? In general, you've already sort of made up your
 
mind that this is very highly wordy, or this i
s somewhere's in the middle...and t
his
 
is the way that we find people lu m
ping in their rating: they lump somewhere in the
 
middle, or somewhere at one end, or somewhere at the other end.
 
Now, some of the qualities are extremely distinct; t
his one i
s a problem of
 
generalized emphasis. This is actually a more accurate j
Lldgement, I think, than if
 
we counted every thing up, because what we're saying is —what we will be saying event-
ually, is that if you take a very large sample of human behavior (
say that last song
 
as .
.. 
a rowing song from Tanganyika)...if you take most of the songs from that area,
 
you will find that they fall somewhere around the middle in the degree of wordiness,
 
out there will be some on the extreres • We are looking at the average way that they
 
behave, you see, not the way they behave on one specific moment. Eventually, when
 
you start to listen to your music, you are going to find that people have a tendency
 
to move towards one area in this scale. But you'll find examples where they don't; as
 
I told you to begin with, in every society everybody has probably done every thing.
 
t
hat you can possibly do .
.. 
at one point or another .
.. 
but they still have a preference
 
t
owards, they have a cultural l
ean, they have a style, t
hat moves them towards one
 
point or another in the scale. That's what we're looking at; we're looking at what
 
T
 : o .
.. that's what style is.
 
(
TRAINING TAPE)
 
you rate that one?  I think it would probably be extreme, or
 
ue:!
 o it. So that depends on where you are making that particular cut.
 
i
h s peoples are from the Phillipines; they live way back in the forest and they
 
are ii t
ating bird cries. This is part of magic, in their particular culture.. .
in
 
connection with hunting. A lot of jungle peoples sing music like that, and that's music,
 
that's what you do. They also sing very different kinds of songs, and you may find, in
 
connection with your particular people, that they do this sort of thing when they are
 
involved in religious activities, and they do another kind of t
hing--entirely in con-
nection with the amount of text--when they're doing non-religious activities .
.. 
and
 
there you have l
earned something interesting and special. This very often happens, t
hat
 
you have tremendous degrees of r
epetition In music that is connected with religion and
 
a lot of wordiness in music connected with non-religious activities. So again, you
 
have learned something about your particular people: t
hat they segregate this area
 
off and do specialized things in terms of their musical performance.
 
You are going to f
ind a lot of these bird-call-y kinds of things in the music of
 
the world. There are an awful lot of people who sing like the birds--it's really
 
very beautiful.
 
(
TRAINING TAPE)
 
What do you figure that was? (Mixed response) OK, let's count this one: how
 
many on '
extreme repetition'? (
s
)
; how many on '
lots of repetition? (17); how many
 
on '
half and half'? (

.
i)--man, we really cluster in this class; I u
sually g
et more
 
variation '
n that, especially on the first tape. If you want to, I can t
ell you
 
what everybody else in the country coded it as —I mean, everybody that has been
 
tested on these —well, we follow the pattern; it's this one...we are with the major-
ity. It doesn't really matter; there's no real right-way or wrong-way, we're just
 
moving towards agreement--we're conseiing with a lot of other people in the world--
or we're moving toward listening to variation. If you find that you've scored consis-
tently one way or the other, then you are listening in a very specialized kind of
 
way 
.
.. 
and you are probably doing a very interesting kind of job, by t
he
 way. If you
 
find that you score consistently towards repetition, a
s opposed to towards., .you know,
 
you're always on that end of the scale, then you are hearing the repetition that's
 
there very distinctly. If you find that you're scoring towards the wordy s
ide of what
 
everybody else's general opinion is, you are hearing vocal segregates very, very dis-
tinctly, and that's what you're listening at. So you will find out something about
 
yourself in connection with this generalized rating system.
 
Now, my feeling there was that the lead singer was repeating quite a lot, himself--
as well as t
he chorus repeating--so that's why I would have put it here; but, as I
 
say, when you have an opinion, hang in thereand think about it.
 
hat, by the way, was from the Cameroon; it's a uluA And t
here's another thing
 
o that particular deal I can't resist pointing out to you...it's very African. No-
tLce the interaction between the leader and the chorus. (REPEAT TAPE) Notice that
 
he was tatkin  while they were singing--all the time. Furthermore, they never waited
 
for him to stop; they came in on top of him all the time •  That kind of intera'-t on
 
bet-ween leader and chorus is one of the features of...if you wanted to draw a dia-
grain of it, i
t'd look like this (
DRrrI G DIAGRPJi); t
hey sort of overlap eac}iother all
 
the tix
--there is a constant interplay between the two. This is one '
if the big
 
differences between Black and White style in the United States. I don't know if you
 
are aware of that or not, but next t
ime you hear a Black chorus singing a spiritual.
 
notice that they never let the leader get all the way through, if it's q r
epeat line;
 
they're always coming in underneath, if it's only a hum line, and the leader similarly
 
starts on top of them. While in White style, you get a kind of a respectful pause
 
between when the leader shuts up and the chorus comes in. (
ELtJlPIE: VERSE AND CHORUS
 
'
JESSE JAL S') That would be the way this would be sung: your leader would take a
 
verse, and then, at the end of the verse, the chorus would come in and everybody
 
would join in on the chorus part, because that's the repetition of it...and by the
 
way, you would score that '
half wordiness, half repetition' for that particular s
ong,
 
becauae the chorus is always repeated. But the chorus never starts to sing until the
 
leader is through (
REPEAT EXAMPLE) You wouldn't start to sing before; I mean, that's
 
where you start to sing. The leader and the chorus are always two distinct entities.
 
It never happens in Black singing style, and it's one of the things you can trace
 
right clearly down; in West Africa, and in fact t
hraugho .
t t
he African continent, you
 
find this pattern all of the time.

all about. We sing about them a good d
eal in the United States  ut we have a different
 
attitude on the subject, underneath.)
 
How did you score that one? Two? Three? I didn't hear that much repetition, but
 
maybe you did. I would say two to one, meseif; I think I would pick two after some
 
consideration--I thought it was for one when it started off .
.. Yes she did repeat.
 
(
Student: It sounded to me like she would start in, and maybe she would go on to
 
sa ething else, but then the next line would be the same beginning...) V

portions of the world--the Ainu, the so-called Hairy Ainu, of Japan...the ancient de-
scendants of god knows what...the white people that live in very r
emote areas in
 
Japan...they hocket; a few central  South American tribes hocket; and they hocket in
 
the Swiss Alps. They also hocket in almost every pygmy society. It's a very, very
 
curious phenomenon. Most musicologists think it's the oldest style in the world, and
 
that this is probably the way we all once sang, in these completely relaxed, liquid,
 
yodelling sounds. Wait '

LECTURE #

 (
Monday, April 9
)
 
I
 want to go ahead today and try to finish up, in the next time or two,
 
the whole question of the classification of instruments and what kinds of
 
instruments there are. We've been talking about ideophones, and I
 think the
 
last t
hing that I played for you was an example of a slit-drum, which i
s made
 
out of a
 hollow log with a slit in the top of it; the lip of the slit i
s filed
 
or rasped down to mks possibilities for variation on both sides and occasionally
 
even the end of the slit. The drum is normally played with sticks, but I hope
 
you are aware of the fact that it i
s not r
eally a drum at all but another variety
 
of ideophone. The slit drum has no membrane across it, but when you have a r
eal
 
drum (
it i
s because) you start stretching membranes over it. There are an awful
 
l
ot of percussion instruments o
f t
his kind that are generally hit in one way or
 
another to make t
hem sound, and if you stick to the  
'
  classification sys-
tem these can be either ideo,hones or membranophones .
.. 
most of them, at l
east.
 
All of the ones t
hat are made out of wood or metal without a membrane are one
 
variety or another of ideophone, and when you start stretching membranes across
 
the top they become membranophones.
 
Here we have an example of one of the old European forms of drumming, which
 
i
s the pipe-and-tabor combination.  You s
ee pictures of these in very ancient
 
medieval manuscripts; they consist of a pipe and a little teeny-tiny drum that
 
d
angles from the l
ittle finger of the guy playing t
he pipe, and he can play it
 
and bang on his drum at the same time • You still find this in some parts of
 
Europe; it's a very ancient European style. (R
iCORDED MUSICAL EXAMPIE) That was
 
from Peru, by the way. This was a big one, in this case; the medieval ones were
 
the l
ittle bitty ones that dangled from the f
ingers. This was a bigger drum, but
 
it i
s being played in the same way. I forgot that this one was from Peru.
 
'
i
hat happened was that the combination of fife and drumming together, in
 
effect t
he idea, came over from Europe and you still find it in various parts of
 
the Americas.
 
Next we'll be hearing a whole s
eries of different types of drums • This next
 
one i
s f
rom the Navaho. It's water-filled. (
RECORDED EXAMPLE) (
Voice-over: The
 
drum itself i
s filled with water, which gives it a r
ather dull, thudding kind of
 
sound; it brings out t
he bass, sort of.)
 
Next i
s a frame-drum. Frame-drums are probably the simplest variety of drum.
 
They're just a hoop with a hide stretched in the middle. This i
s Eskimo. (
RE-
CORDED EXAMPLE) (
Voice-over: This i
s a shaman doing a healing ceremony. They hold
 
the drum in one hand, and then the hit it on one side and then they turn it around
 
and hit it on the other side, so there's this constant over-and-around motion
 
going on. It's v
ery much like a dance in the playing of the drum itself. They u
se
 
padded sticks. They gettremendous volume out of these things.)
 
Now t
his is another frame-drum, but very different in tone. I
t's nude in t
he
 
I
Aiddle East. (
RECORDED EXAMPTiE) (Voice-over: These are being hand-beaten; you can
 
hear the difference in tone, I think. It's a lot duller, slappier sound.) Those
 
are t
he B
aharian peoples of Israel and the Arabian Penninsu]
.a; they move around.
 
The n
ext couple of examples are African dru m
ming; the s
ort of things that we
 
most often think o
f in t
erms of the developement of drumming. (R
ECORDED EXAMPLE)
 
7
oice-over: You begin to g
et t
he polyrhythm idea here. And the idea of multi-
tonality of the s
ame drum.) Now this cultural style was broug
ht across into the
 
New World, and where drums were allowed in the New World you hear t
he s
ame kind
 
of drumming... (
RECORDED EXAMPJ1
') (Voice-over: If the Proetestant planters of
 
Georgia and Florida hadn't have been so hung up on conversion to protestant Christ-
l
antity we would have the same kind of music in the United States.) As a matter
 
of fact we do, in certain kinds of dimensions. When I was working with the Georgia
 
Sea I
sland Singers they pointed out to me that they clapped in parts, and t
hey
 
voiced these parts. (
Demonstration: treble, baritone, bass claps) They voiced
 
these parts; in other words, they balanced within an ensemble: if there are too
 
many people clapping baritone, somebody s
hould clap bass or somebody should clap
 
t
eble f
' or!  t
his. They b
a T
hnced out t
heir enser'ble work i
n t
his Une  n
d t'r vr.r
 
able to hear out-of-pitch claps, in exactly the same way that a symphony con-
ductor can hear an out-of--pitch violin. I watched Mrs. Jones teaching groups of
 
70-80 people who to clap in her style, and it turns out she responds to an of f-
pitch clap with a good deal of pain and could spot , normally, who was doing it
 
by observing bad position. Furthermore, each clapper had a base-line rhythm: The
 
baritone had a general beat clap (demonstration) and notice that I
'm coming in
 
between my foot, so it goes 'foot, hands, foot, hands' and the down beat of the
 
music is on the '
foot', that is, on the un-sounded beat. (
P0LLY
0LLY-DOOD1E
  
TAPPED OFF- AND ON-BEAT) The on-beat clap is the Anglo rhythm; the off-beat
 
'
lap is the Black rhythm, in this country. It is rather interesting, because
 
it means that the group is co-ordinating around a beat that is not soundedi The
 
rhythmic impulse is coming from an un-sounded beat. Now this again seems to be
 
a very African idea. There have been a number of attempts to analyze African
 
drum rhythms, and in a book called African Music or Music of Africa, I don't recall
 
which, by A.M. Jones, he talks about the fact that the drummers organize themselves
 
around the clap, only nobody is clapping —they simply refer to it as though It
 
were there • And what it appears to be is the underlying, unsounded pulse. There
 
has been an awful lot of arguement about this; Western musicians don't like to
 
think about organizing around something that isn't t
here, I think. It makes u
s all
 
kind of nervous. But as I watched Mrs. Jones it seemed very clear that she wasn't
 
organizing around something that wasn't there, she was organizing around the phys-
ical impulse in the form of the foot beat, which doesn't sound. If the clap ever
 
got bad she would say "Move your feet"; she wouldn't say "Straighten out your
 
hands". In fact she did this to me until I got quite annoyed with her, because I
 
was trying to learn her clapping style and she kept talking about my feat all the
 
time. I didn't care what my feet were doing.
 
In these terms, I would suggest that the rhythm is a kind of acr'oinpaniment
 
for a dance, in effect; that you have the basic physical impulse that is holding
 
the group together in terms of dancing, and the clapping is then embroidery
 
around the movement pattern. I think this is quite possibly the way it works.
 
There i
s probably an apocryphal, but I hope it isn't, story of a
 West African
 
musicologist who was working with an African tribe fairly far out from any other
 
place, and he went away for a day and came back to find the whole tribe gathered
 
around a little one-horsepower motor that he had to run the generator for his re-
cording equipment which was running and giving off intermittant back-fires • They
 
were all drumming to this. They thought it was a real groove. Apparently what they
 
were competant to do was to organize around inconsistancy, which is really the
 
sort of thing that Westerners don't even like to think about very much —it makes
 
us kind of sick at our stomachee, to think about organizing around something that
 
is as erratic as a one-horsepower motor that's backfiring& But apparently the
 
group could do it. (
As I say, I don't know if the story is true or not, but I
 
hope it is, because it is a good example of the way things actually work with
 
these very complex rhythms.)
 
So, what I saw wh n I was working with the Sea Islanders (
and you can see
 
it yourselves if you ever go to a Black church, or a really good Black revival
 
meeting) is people adhering to the same stylistic features, the same important 
stylistic features, and carrying them on after centuries of being away from the
 
home territory but still working within the sa m
e stylistic features that had been
 
developed many generations ago. It s rather a remarkable thing to be aware of
 
because you will find that even groups that are not as elaborate as the Sea Is-
landers in their style clap in pitch--it's typical in Black church to hear several
 
pitches of claps coming out in the clapping —and to hear multiple inventions in
 
the clapping around an '
un-hearable' beat, a beat that does not sound. Now each
 
person in the Sea Island group had their own particular rhythm (
t
)FMONST1V TTON).
 
That's sort of their base-line pattern; they embroidered on that all the time.
 
But the total effect was of extreme complexity; when you get five individuals
 
doing t
his sort of thing you get the same kind of complexity t
hat you g
et out
 
of listening to a great African dr u
m choir.
 
The reason, by the way, that Blacks don't  drum here, at l
east within the
 
rural tradition, is due to the fact that there was a great deal of difference
 
in the handling of imported Africans by Catholic-controlled countries and Pro-
testant-controlled countries. Where-ever Catholicism was the rule there was little
 
attention paid to manifestations of the Old World religion; certain kinds of com-
binations could be allowed, so that you have altars in Haiti w
ith things that are
 
sacred to Dambala, the African god of snakes, and a picture of St. Patrick holding
 
the snake up, on the same altar, both being worshipped at the same time. The Cath-
olic Church did not object to this kind of thing; they allowed for the preservation
 
of certain aspects of the old religion along with the new. Protestanism was a little
 
bit more up-tight and insisted on the wiping-out of the old religion, and primary
 
to that, was the wiping-out of the drum, becuase they felt that the drum was so
 
t
erribly important in religious ceremonies, and indeed it was. They were also
 
frightened of the drum being u
sed as a method of communication from plantation
 
to plantation, so drumming was simply forbidden. But you read a lot of traveler's
 
accounts da'ing Slavery, in which they point out that the slaves did something
 
that seems very siiiys they would take a big iron kettle and turn it-upside down
 
and they would dance around it and they would say things to it, and they would
 
pick it up, caress it, and turn it back down again, and anything they said into
 
that pot, according to the white observers, the slavesbeliev.d...they would tell
 
it their secrets, in other words. It never seemed to occur to anybody that this
 
was a drum-shape, and the drum was still orga,Lnizing the dancing even t
hough they
 
didn't play it.
 
This is what I mean: things that are tremendously important, i
tylistically,
 
maintain themselves, in sort of disguised ways, over long, long periods of time.
 
I do think that in contemporary Black music you can hear a lot of what we just
 
heard here: you can hear polyrhythm---multlple rhythms at the same time--, tuned
 
percussion, and you get organization around a beat '
that isn't there' 4you
 
et
 
a down-beat not sounded). And you g
et multiple voicing, which is really these
 
two (
(polyrhythm and tuned percussion)) together.
 
It is very frequently said about African music that it is based on '
call
 
and response', or antiphony. I think people regard this in too simplistic a
 
sense. I get the feeling of a tremendous number of conversations all going on
 
at the same time, rather than just simple '
I say, you say'. But the '
I say,
 
you say' goes on so consistantly within the individual, even, that it i
s the
 
feature, to me, of watching Black style. There is constant reciprocal movement
 
within the body of the dancers; there is even reciprocal movement in terms of th T
h
 
base-line clap: my foot says something, and then my hand says something back. It's
 
as though you are dividing yourself in the middle into two people and you're car-
rying on a conversation right there. There is a kind of multiple synchrony of re-
sponsive movement and responsive sound going on throughout Black African music,
 
wherever it travels. This is something you ought to keep looking for and hearing.
 
We've been talking about various types of African drums, but the Far East
 
has also a different drum eluture. Throughout the Far Fast you have orchestras
 
of drums, but they are a little bit different from the African orchestras. There's
 
not quite so much improvisation. You find an attention to very complex structure.
 
This is a Burmese drum-chime chorus. (RECORDED EXMPI ) (Voice-over: This guy is
 
standing in front of a row of perhaps 20 drums, each of them very accurately tuned.
 
There's real good synchrony there!) That's a little clarinet-ish type of wind in-
strument, and the two players are keeping in synchrony. Notice how different that
 
is from the African style, the African style would be having two or three rhythms
 
going on, if not 20-30, whereas these two guys are trying to keep together; they 're
 
t
rying to perform in unison on two completely
 disparate instruments.
 
(
STUDENT: In the African music it seems like there is more of a steady beat
 
going, while this seems as though it is more at liberty.)  Yes. African rhythm
 
seems to be (
and everything I say about African rhythm must be qualified, because
 
it's still being strongly investigated, and it's awfully hard to get at) but the
 
baseline of African rhythm appears to be a 12 count according to Prof. Mantle-Hood
 
(
??) who's worked on this a great deal, and most of the drummers w
ithin a choir
 
will take one pattern within th t count of 12 and more or l
ess stay with it; you'll
 
have only one o
r two drums that are moving around improvisationally entirely.
 
Most o
f them will take some part of that 12 count and stay repeating that par-
ticular pattern. Now i
f this i
s true, .
..you see, 12 i
s a marvelous number: you
 
can do all kinds of t
hings with 12. You can divide i
t u
p into threes, or into
 
fours, or into twos, or into sixes. It g
ives you an awful lot of room for a variety
 
of different rhythmic effects, particularly if they're piled up on top of each
 
other. And particularly if, and this i
s almost a mind-blower about African drum-
ming that I
've heard, according to Dr, Hood and prof. Jones, entering drum in-
strum
ents pick their own point in the count of 12 that they want to come in on
 
$o o
ne guy i
s s
tarting his count of 12 at, say, one; and t
he next guy starts his
 
count at five; and t
he next guy at seven; and the next guy at 22, and from there
 
on preserves his own count of twelve I
 Which g
ives you a possibility for s
hifting
 
rhythms which i
s incredible to think about. This i
s why African drum music seems
 
continually different and you never can f
igure out why, because when one guy's on
 
beat #19, the other guy's on #1261 With multiples of people working within a count
 
f
 1
2, and starting whenever they feel like it, the mathmatical possibilities are
 
: rt of staggering. This appears to be why it i
s so difficult for Western musicians
 
t
o figure out what i
s going on within a drum chorus. This was only discovered,
 
i
rmedenta1 y, by hooking several dru m
mers up to electronic g
izmos t
hat recorded
 
each beat, and t
hen going back over it with slide rules to f
igure this out. BUT,
 
t
here i
s extreme difference, then, between African drumming style and Far Eastern
 
d
rumming style, although both are very highly developed.
 
In the Far East you g
et something that did not happen in Africa, and that is
 
t
he extension of the tuned-drum ensembles, where an individual will be playing o
n
 
a whole number of specially-tuned drums, into the same effect being done on metal
 
g
ongs. So you have the developement of the chime, or gong o
rchestra of the Far
 
East. (RECORDED EXAMPLE) (
Vo ce.-over: This is classical music, as you can t
ell,
 
I think.) Now this is a gong orchestra from the Phi f
lipines. (RECORDED EXAMPLE)
 
This i
s also the part of the world where people not only hit gongs, but they hit
 
bells. The difference between a gong and a bell is that you hit a bell on the
 
rim--it is constructed so that the middle part is acoustically dead--whereas the
 
gong is hit on the middle, and the edge is dead accoustically. Abell rings by
 
being tapped around the edge, either by an internal clapper or you can bit it
 
while it is freely suspended (because it is suspended by the middle, so that that
 
damps out the middle); a gong however you try to keep as free-hanging as possible,
 
so that it can vibrate all over and you hit it in the middle so that it shivers
 
out from the middle impact. Other than that they are essentially the same kinds
 
of instrument and are both classified as ideophones.
 
The ideophone family is the l
argest; it's the oldest, an  it is the most
 
complexly developed. Moving out from there, you get the xylophones, which are
 
wood sounding, and also are formed into orchestras--some of these in Africa;
 
where you don't have metal culture as highly developed as in the Far East, you
 
get wooden instruments with wooden sounders. You can get wooden xylophones in the
 
middle of Africa which are made out of tree trunks and guys are running up and
 
down beating on them—.enormous things as long as this room, with huge tree trunks
 
chopped off. They look like  a giant's version of a xylophone. Probably this is
 
the way they got started. They are obviously, in t
his respect, akin to the alit
 
drum.
 
Moving out from this there is one lttle family of ideophones that I want
 
to mention to you, and these are the so-called African sansas, sometimes refered
 
to as mblra. Actually, every African language has some word for this, so that's
 
the reason nobody's been able to come up with an overall term. I think sansa
 
is the one that's most generally used. This is an adaptation of the principle of
 
the xylophone. What you have are tongues of bamboo or metal that are suspended
 
over a sound box, and the vibration of the tongue produces the tone. (DEMONST:1A-
TION) You see, it has l
ittle rattles along the tongues, and they rattle it
hen
 
the tongue vibrates •  This I got a number of years ago from a man who had been
 
in Africa, and who brought it back for me. Hugh Tracy was here a couple of
 
years ago, he's a South African ethnoinuaicalogiat, and he came in and looked
 
at it and he said the name of this particular variety is okembi, and it is either
 
Umbunda or Umbundi (
(???)), and that is the corner where Congo and Angola meet
 
North Rhodesia. This is what an ethnomusicologist is supDosed to be able to do
 
for youl  But this is practically the African national instrument, second only
 
to the drum. It's played all across Black Africa and its a rather quiet and
 
contemplative instrument. You can walk along and play it to yourself, and it
 
has a pretty rippling quality to it.
 
(
Answering questions: The wooden box only amplifies the sound. This is undoubtedly
 
out of tune. Normally It would be tuned to a natural major scale, according to
 
Dr. Tracy. But I kind of like it the way it is. Whenever I get it tuned up into
 
a regular scale it doesn't sound right to me: the notes are a little bit dead, and
 
I have the feeling it wasn't built for that tuning. Besides I like the random ef-
fect of this, which is...
 
Well, this is about the end of ideophones, you will probably be relieved to
 
hear, and we can talk a little bit next time about the remaining instrumnezits. But
 
I
'm more interested in how they combine, so we'll not spend as much time over the
 
other instruments, which you've heard more frequently. Everybody's heard a fiddle
 
and a clarinet, and there're only so many variations that are worth listening to.

 lECTURE # 1
7
 
(Wednesday, April 11)
 
We are r
eally through with the ideophones and the membranophones and
 
we c
an move on, except for one kind of oddball little instrument that i
s
 
found pretty much universally. It has a mysterious name that no-one r
eally
 
q
uite understands • I f
ind that most people are really quite startled to
 
find that it has a world-wide distribution. This i
s the Jew's Harp, so called.
 
I
t goes without saying that this has nothing to do with Jews; the instrument is
 
played all over t
he place and there is no reason to associate it with Jews, par-
ticularly one way or another; although it is played in Israel, it i
s played e-
qually as such in other parts of the world. Some ethnomusicologists feel that
 
this i
s a corruption of the term '
jaw's harps,
 because you do p
lay it in associa-
tion with the jaw. Nobody knows. By the way, it's not a harp, either, so it's
 
a completely balled u
p name and there's nothing much anybody can do about t
his
 
but point it out.
 
It's made out d
ifferent types of material in different parts of the world.
 
It's siap1eit form, probably, i
s a little flat strip of bamboo with a kind of
 
slit tongue cut out in t
he middle, which can vibrate freely; the tongue i
s plucked,
 
and the instrument i
s held up against the side of the jaw.
 
The way the t
hing works 1
8 by changing the inside contours of your mouth,
 
in somewhat the same way you do in pronouncing various vowels; you amplify t
he
 
base tone of t
he little thing that projects • And in amplifying this by changing
 
the inside of your mouth, you bring out, or make louder, various of the over-tones.
 
Have I discussed over-tones? There i
s a curious physical fact t
hat you need
 
to know about the behaviour of sound. As I pointed out before, when we are dealing
 
with sound, we are dealing with something that vibrates within the range of fre-
quencies that are audible to the human ear. If you think of this in terms of a
 
vibrating string or a vibrating column of air, there i
s a distinct number of vi-
brations per s
econd at the low end of the scale and at the high end of the scale
 
at which human hearing i
s possible. Each one of these things that vibr
.te i
s doing
 
some very compile ted physical things every time that it vibrates. Suppose you
 
had a string that i
s going from here to here (DRA;'
(
'ING ON BOAnD). 1len you pluck
 
i
t, i
t vibrates at— to keep the arithmatic simple--at tOO times/second. Now that
 
is fairly close to standard '
A', which is 440  or )
.38 (
depending upon whether you're
 
in Europe or in the United States; one of our interesttng international problems
 
is the fact that the Europeans have a different
 than the Americans have —we
 
like our '
A' just a little bit higher, so '
when orchestras travel back and forth
 
they have to re-tune just very slightly. There is an international '
A' which is
 
k
ept in an air-tight safe in the middle of Brussels, which i
s gotten out and
 
plunked every once in a while —I presume at the soistices, or something like t
hat--
to confirm the '
A'-ness of things. The international '
A' is 138, rather than 440.)
 
So our hypothetical string is vibrating at 400 cycles/second from one end to
 
t
he other. But i
t is also doing something else: it is vibrating in halves. Each
 
end of the string is vibrating from the center point in the middle; this i
s  oIng
 
on at the same time. And what do you know, these '
half-vibrations' are going ex-
actly twice as fast as the base-line string. These sounds are coming out simultan-
eously; by the way, i
f you heard them both at the same degree of volume you would
 
be hearing what we, in the Western culture, call the octave. So when I go (
SINGS
 
HIGH NOTE) and he goes (
SINGS OCTAVE LONER) we are sounding.. .my (
SINGS HIGH NOTE)
 
is going exactly twice as fast as his (
SINGS OCTAVE LOWER).
 
This is part of the function of the string or the column of air, so that
 
both of these sounds are being sounded at the same t
ime when you pluck a string.
 
The reason you don't hear them is because the bOO times/second vibration is louder,
 
and the other one is higher and softer.
 
The string, however, i
n not just doing this. It is also vibrating in quar-
ters (
which would be g
oing twice as fast as the other one, so you're g
etting up
 
to 1600 times/second). I
t's also v
ibrating in thirds; and it's also vibrating in
 
s
ixths. It's vibrating in a tremendously complex pattern of relationships, and
 
those series of v
ibrations are called by three different names, all of which have
 
something to do with the nature of the physical fact t
hat we're looking at here.
 
One is '
over-tone'; that indicates that the tones that are being produced are
 
higher, above the normal base-line tone of the string. Another term that you
 
occasionally use, or will see used, is partial; the reason that the term  '
par-
tial , is used is that it indicates that only part of the string is vibrating
 
and that's what you're hearing there. The third name is '
harmonic'; the reason
 
this name is apt is that if trace out a series of overtones that are produced
 
by any string you find that you cone up with the natural major scale, if you
 
arrnge them sequentially: do, re, ml, fa, so, la, ti, do..It goes on higher than
 
that, but it gets beyond the range of hearing. The fact is that if you stop a
 
tring half way down you get this higher note; you've done that probably on your
 
own stringed instrument...it's one of the ways people tune. If you stop it a
 
quarter of the way down, you can hear the second over-tone. You can actually
 
produce these, depending on the sensitivity of your instrument, at a number of
 
nodal points along the string. That's what I
'm d
iscussing. So that '
when you
 
pluck a string or vibrate a column of air, you are simultaneously hearing all
 
of these partial tones.
 
The jaw's harp works by amplifying these over-tones...(Student asks if to
 
produce the overtones one frets the string?) No. You stop the string from vi-
brating  in order to hear the over-tone. You don't press it all the way, you
 
put your finger down at the nodal point, just damping half of the string by that
 
action; so what you are hearing is the string vibrating from here to here. It's
 
kind of magical. I hope you don't press me on it too hard, because when it comes
 
right down to it, I don't really quite believe it myself. Except I happen to know
 
it works this way. (
Student has never seen a Jew's Harp.) They used to be the
 
little instrument that you could pick up and carry around in your pocket. They're
 
shaped sort of like this, with a tongue that comes out in the middle, the one
 
I used to have. They are very small, just about so big, and you hold them up to
 
the angle of your jaw or you put them in your mouth and bite on them with your
 
teeth and pluck on the little thing in between. By changing the inside of your
 
mouth, you produce a magnification or amplification of these over-tones that are
 
going on. You don't change the...this part at all, you just amplify (
(preferen-
tially)) by changing the insides of your mouth.
 
This whole series of partials, by the way, is what gives instruments their
 
color, their tonal color. It's one of the reasons that violins süund different
 
from trumpets, or that one guitar will sound different from another guitar. The
 
construction of the sound box amplifies these partials a little bit one way or
 
another so that the whole color of the instrument is changed. They are useful to
 
know about.
 
This little jaw's harp idea, then, appears to have been something that  as
 
probably independantly discovered by man, because the instrument is so wide spread.
 
ou find it everywhere. Presumably, e erybody came upon this o
rinciple at some
 
point or another. This is, as you know, one of the $9,000,000 questions in an-
thropologyt when people do the same things, is it because they were in touch with
 
each other 3
ndborrowed Ideas from each other, or did they simply happen to fall
 
upon the same kind of principle? In the case of musical instruments, with a very
 
base-line instrument of this type where you find it quite widely distributed across
 
the face of the globe, we generally think this was probably independantly invented.
 
When you get a very complex instrument, with a great deal of fancy-dancy business
 
involved in constructing it, and you find that in adjacent areas, it is likely
 
that borrowing occurred. Every one of the cases, you kind of have to look at sep-
erately.
 
Let me play you a little bit of jaw's harp here, so that you can...(R r
.oRj)ED
 
EXAMPLE) That was being played in the Phllllp t
hes, by the way, but it could equally
 
well have been played in the middle of Africa or almost any place on the face of
 
the globe.
 
Now we're going to move along, and talk next about —by the way, what was the
 
jaw's harp? How would you classify that? It's an ideophone, right? An ideophone
 
being a '
self-sounder', that is it doesn't have strings, it's not done by air;
 
the only reason it's in the mouth is because you are using your mouth as a reson-
ating box. (
Student suggests that you are u
sing your skin (
of the cheek) as you
 
stretch skin across a drum.) Not The skin isn't what's vibrating. The mouth is
 
simply b
eing u
sed as a r
esonator, a sound box. The thing that's vibrating is
 
what you look at in t
he classification of instruments; you look at the vibrating
 
surface, and if it's part of the construction of the instrument as it stands t
hen
 
it's an idoophone; if it's a membrane, its a membranophone.
 
So we are going to start talking now about airophones. In this case what '
 s
 
vibrating is a column of air and it has to be made to vibrate, because otherwise
 
air just site there. In order to make a wind instrument sound, you not only have
 
to blow into it, but you have to blow in various kinds of complicated, inter-
mittant ways.
 
The f
irst kind of classification under airophone is the trumpet, in which
 
the air is made to vibrate by the player's lips, which stretch and compress alter-
nately. Oddly enough, the trumpet is not played a great deal outside of Western
 
culture; t
here are a few examples, but not t
erribly many. One of the most notable
 
exceptions being the Australian trumpets we heard before. (
RECORDED EXAMPLE) The
 
horn belongs to the same family. These are African horns. Incidently, I thinks it 's
 
interesting that in non-Western societies most of your...let me start over: a num-
ber of times in non-Western society you will find blown instruments, or Instr u
ments
 
that d
epend on breath, associated with magic or religion or they are the voice of
 
the god. These are African trznpets. (RECORDED EXAMPLE) Notice that that is quite
 
dissociated from the music that is going along at the same time. Though I don't
 
have the ethnography on this particular area, I bet you fifty cents t
hat it's
 
a religious ceremonial and this is the sacred voice, coming at them, becuase i
t
 
operates quite independantly from the rst of the orchestra.
 
We've talked about one family with some very quick examples: the trumpet and
 
horn family, which you can think about together because basically they depend on
 
the lip. A second family are the oboes or reeds. In these instruments the oboe
 
has two tight-fitting blades of a flexible reed that serve as the lip, in effect:
 
t
hey make the input of air intermittant and start the column of air inside the
 
i
nstrument vibrating. Here's an oboe from the Abruzzi area of Italy (
RFC
,ORDED
 
EXAMPLE) Now, clarinets are like oboes except that they have just  one reed.
 
There are double-reed instruments and single- r
eed instruments; oboes are
 
double, and clarinets are single, and "it has a single beating reed, which vibrates
 
under the impact of breath, and in doing so alternately opens and shuts a
 
rectangular side hole at the closed upper end of the tube." (
Student: you have a
 
plastic mouth-piece which attaches on to the wind instrument, and the wooden
 
reed i
s strapped on with a metal clamp. The reed is flat on one side and rounded
 
on the other and it comes to a very sharp point (
(bevel)) at the top. One side of
 
the mouthpiece is also flat, so the reed comes up to the mouthpiece like this,
 
and there's a hole on the side of the mouthpiece. So you blow down on top, and
 
there's a very thin space between the sandwich of reed and mouthpiece, and (
(the
 
passage of air)) makes the reed vibrate, and the air passes down the tube. The
 
double-reed has no mouthpiece, the two reeds vibrating against each other.)
 
Remember, by the way, that in various societies of the world, these are not
 
made out of plastic or etc., but the principle is exactly the same. It can be
 
ma de out of all kinds of 5ubstances. This is a single clarinet with one tube from
 
Greece...quite a di'ferent tone quality. (RECORDED EXAMPlE) We don't find all the
 
expert instrumentalists in symphony orchestras. The degree of expertise of ord-
inary human beings is really remarkable, the potential to which they can force
 
t
hemselves.
 
You can also have double clarinets, by the way, with two tubes. This is a
 
d
ouble- (
RECORD EXA PIE) That's Kurdish. Are you t
he Kurdish lady? Did you re-
gnise it? I thought you might.
 
Another major family in the reed division in general--oboes and clarinets
 
are both reeds-- is the bagpipe, which i
s a collection of reed tubes, sometimes
 
iO
eo  a
nd sometimes cl r r
iets, sometimes both mixed in together, which are hooked
 
i
r
1 0 some k
ind of a ba;  qrrar ement which is filled with air from t
he olay r's
 
breath, and which is squeezed out by his elbow so that the air i
s forced out thru
 
the tubes. This instrment is a very complicated instrument to describe, but is
 
actually found all over Europe and also in the Near East. It i
s very traditional.

he
 
type with w
l i
ch you are most f a
iliar. (RECORDED EXPJPI
,E) That's an Aeolian (
?)
 
cipe, played in Ireland, and it's one of the most complex forms of bagpipe.
 
2he Aeolian pipes are constructed in such a complicat d way t
hat you can get all
 
<
inds of crazy effects of this kind on it. In addition to having the two or three
 
es,
 ni  then you're blowing into another reed that you're playing your tunes
 
ar',
 sa  :lowing into the bag of air you've filled up and squeezing it out over
 
i
re, besides that 
.
.. 
with the Aeolian pipe there is a strap that you wear across
 
ur leg —you have to do this s
itting down — and you hit it with your elbow as
 
,
ou go around, and that forces air up through certain of the pipes, and that's
 
it
 i
ves you the chord. So you're squeezing with this elbow, and hitting this
 
your right elbow, and bl
ng, and .
.. it really is a performance. There
 
r
.9  not very many really good Aeolian pipers; it takes a long,long  time to learn
 
ow to play the thing. I wish I had some less complex bagoipe from this particular
 
i
'
ecord.
 
There is one more reed instrument that i
s im ortant. Can you think what it
 
might be? It is one that you hear a lot. The accordian, which is also a reed
 
instrument. Notice that you don't have to have the human breath involved as your
 
technology gets more and n
ore complic ted. You just use air. Now the accordian
 
was primarily a European invention but for some reason, wherever it goes, it see:s
 
to catch on. So t
his example is from South America. VatlW Grosso, as a matter of
 
faot.(R
]CORDED EXk:PIE) This is clearly Mestizo (
?) music from South America. It
 
is interesting that there is a whole Mestizo style that developed in south Texas
 
and in northern Mexico in which the accordian is equally u
sed. There is a lot of
 
debate about how it got there. My personal hunch having lived in the area is that
 
it was adopted from the German communities which also moved into Texas; there are
 
quite a number of German settlements in central Texas, and they played polkas
 
and waltzes on the old squeeze-box. I have a hunch that it was transmuted that
 
way and was picked up by people of Mexican descent and was u
sed ap music for
 
dance accompaniment in their own forms. But I could be quite wrong about that;
 
no-one has really investigated that history.
 
The last kind of wind instrument —I think we'll have time for just and example
 
or two--is the f
lute. The r
eason t
he flutes are different is that no r
ntter what
 
ind of shape t
hey have, whether you blow them from end to end or
 
ross-ways, t
he
 
wind-interupting device that makes the air vibrate is a hole with a sharpened edge.
 
The flute player's job is to send a very tightly-controlled stream of air over
 
this sharp edge of the hole in such a way that the air will vibrate and you will
 
get some tone out of it. Sometimes it is built-in. Here's one from Yugoslavia.
 
(RECORDED EX M?IR) This is a lengthwise, vertical flute. (Notice that's in strophic
 
form.)
 
The last one I want to play you is the nose-flute. This is an odd sort of
 
off-shoot from this family in which the air is blown through the nose in order to
 
vibrate. This puts a lot of strain on the performer, because it has to he a very
 
sharp stream of air, so she's--this is a lady in Malaya, playing a nose-flute —
 
and she's doing this in a very stacatto form becuase it's harder control the
 
wind when you're blowing out through your nose, than when you're blowing out thru
 
your mouth. Nobody knows why anybody goes to t
he trouble to play a nose-flute;
 
it's awfully hard, and in those parts of the world where it's done it is normally
 
associated with magic. I suspect it has something to do with the mar1c nature of
 
the human breath. This is very serious music. (RECORDED F1AMPI ) Mostly you find
 
nose-flutes in the Far East: They are fairly widely played in Malaya, I
've heard
 
them in Japan, I
've heard them from that general corner of the world. There are
 
lots of varieties of flutes which I haven't had time to play for you here. There
 
are the kind that go this way, and then there are the Pan pipes, which are a ser-
ies of flutes arranged in vertical order, and you go across the tops this way.
 
All of them belong to the same family. And the flute, by the way-, is probably
 
the most generally wide-spread of all of the wind instruments. Flutes are all over;
 
trumpets and the others are much more geographically located.

 LECTURE # 18
 (
Friday, April 13)
 
The last catagory that we want to talk about is the chordophone, which
 
includes all the varieties of stringed instruments. Dr. Sachs (
?) says:
 
"Stringed instruments or chordophones are the most recent class in the
 
primitive world. They appear in four principle families: Harps and 7ithers, 
Lyres and Lutes. The arbitrary confusing use of these terms should at all
 
events be discontinued." And then he goes on to give explanations that are
 
5 3
 complicated as to the distinctions between the classes that I
'm not sure
 
that I really ever get it straight myself. But I think I have roughly the idea.
 
Let me write these on the board for you.
 
Harps, and I quote Dr. Sachs,"In a harp, and only in a harp, the plane of the
 
strings is at right angles, not parallel, to the sound board. The strings run
 
away from it, not, as in a violin, along it." This is made a little bit clearer
 
if you visualize one of the early forms of the harp, which is sometimes called
 
the '
ground harps. You hardly ever see them any more, but there are pictures of
 
people playing them. What they did is put a flexible rod or branch or something
 
like that into the ground, and pull it over by means of a string that connects
 
its upper end to a piece of leather that covers a foot-wide pit as a resonator.
 
So you have your thing .
.. 
flexible branch tied to a string, and this is fastened
 
to a piece of leather that covers a pit that's dug into the ground. The pit a
cts
 
as a resonator. Then you pluck the string and by bending the bow back and forth
 
the string is tautened in various ways and you can get various pitches on it.
 
So the string is running away from the plane of the resonator. The same thing
 
happens in a harp (
DRAW DIAGRAM ON BOARD). The box underneath i
s serving as a
 
resonator and the strings are running out and away from it, instead of along the
 
top of it.
 
The ground harp is such an ancient instrument that you don't find it around
 
very much any more, but an equivalent instrument —and probably, according to most
 
ethnomusicologists, the instrument from which all the others stem. -is the musical
 
bow, which is a hunting bow, actually, and #ieh is played by holding the
 
end of the bow up to the jaw of the performer and, as with the Jew's haro,
 
changing the inside of the mouth 80 that the overtones of the resonance of
 
the string are picked up and amplified. It i
s a chordophone, rather than an
 
ideophone as the Jew's harp is, because of the difference in the material of
 
which it is made.
 
Did I talk about musical bows in here before to any extent? I don't think
 
I did. A very interesting thing happened, which I discussed in the folk music
 
class, with the musical bow. This is a v
ery early musical instrument. And by
 
the way, there are a number of anthropologists and ethnomusicologists who feel
 
that the use of the bow as a musical instrument preceded its use as a weapon.
 
But the bow is quite wide spread. You find it in Africa, throughout South A
nier-
ica, throughout various parts of the Orient. It's not a very loud instrument,
 
as you might imagine; it's fairly quiet, and the musical bows that I
've heard in
 
r
ecordinrs from Africa are rather personal and quiet instruments. Archaeologically,
 
tie e have been evidences of the musical bow in Central America and in Mexico,
 
and some evidence that at one time it was an important instrument in the Plains
 
cultures of the North American Indians. But it has completely died out. Even Buffy
 
St. Marie, whoplays the musical bow currently, says that she only heard of it
 
being played; it wasn't traditional among her own people; she thought it would
 
be a good instrument to revive, but it had really died out. And it's always been
 
kind of a puzzle for ethnomusicologists why you couldn't find musical bows in
 
North America, whereas you could in Central America--but only just slight arch-
aeological evidence that it was possibly played in North Ame ica. Since it's
 
such a bow-and-arrow culture, you would figure that they would also have the mus-
ical bow.
 
The fact remains that until fairly recently there was no evidence whatever
 
that you could point to of musical bows definitely being played in North America.
 
You could 
.
.. 
everybody just assumed that they must have been, at one time, until
 
in
 o'
 -e:
i g  and oddball t
hing happened.
 
A fellow t
urned up in the Ozarks who played a muoical bow t
hat he had nude;
 
and he had learned how to do it from his father, who had l
earned how to do it
 
from his father, who had learned how to do it from his father, who had l
earned
 
how to do it from his father who said that he had l
earned how to do it from an
 
old Indian lady who used to live around there. Well, that goes back so far that
 
it is completely impossible to check out, but the bow had remained traditional
 
within this f
amily. So our first really solid evidence that the bow was played
 
comes from an Ozark hillbilly, technically, rather than from a contemporary
 
Indian. This sometimes happens. There i
s a sort of a...in a way this i
s what
 
happens within cultural areas. In the center of the culture area where the action
 
is you find the newer things coming along; the older things you find around on
 
t
he edges. Here yuU find it even borrowed at an edge region, and only existing
 
in the borrwoed form.
 
The fellow who was discovered playing t
he musical bow, mu
sh to everyone's
 
r
eal surprise--this i
s what you look like when you play a musical bow--as you can
 
s
ee, it's just a regular old bow, and you hold it u
p to the side of your jaw
 
and you pluck on it —the fellow who was d
iscovered playing t
his rather archaic
 
musical i
nstrument —you have no idea what a sensation this caused in musicological
 
circles; people just didn't believe i
t at first .
.. they  decided he must have r
ead
 
about how t
o do i
t in a hook, but the evidence within the family is r
eally quite
 
strong--his name i
s Jimmy Driftwood, and he lives in a very small town in the
 
czarks. He i
s extremely intelligent and his folks had lived in the Ozarks for
 
aaout four g
enerations--they had come down in the very early days, down the tr iis
 
from N
ow England, down the Appalachian Mountain trails, and had moved i
nto that
 
area and had just stayed t
here. They mostly were farming people. Jimmy, however,
 
by the time his g
eneration c
ame along the family were in fairly good shape, and
 
he went to college and became a highschool teacher, eventually the princip
as
 
a matter of fact, of Snowball, Ark. As I say, he i
s an extremely intelligent man,
 
and he decided that the kids of the area could learn better if their tradion was
 
presented to them in a positive way rather than in a negative way--if they w
ere
 
always thinking about '
us ignorant hillbillies', but t
hinking about '
us ad-
venturous pioneers'. So he began to present traditonal family culture and
 
traditional Ozark culture in the school system, when he was heading it, and
 
in the process wrote a large number of songs himself, explaining events of
 
American history and regional history to the  hildren. 1
1e u
sed tradlonal tunes
 
of the area, and he wrote a number of awfully good songs one of which got to
 
be quite a hit a number of years ago: Thp Battle Of New Orleans. He must have
 
written a couple of hundred songs of this genera]. type.
 
The whole story of Jimmy is that he gave up high school after a while an
 
made quite a h
it Cf money when nis songs began to hit as an entertainer. Then
 
he decided t
hat what his community really needed was a kind of platform, a place
 
in which their traditional music and their tradional skills could be presented
 
o the people could feel proud of what they knew how to do,,by virtue  of
 
having other people come in and see. You see yourself through other people. This
 
is t
he whole l
esson of anthr000logy
-. it really is a mirror for man. If you never
 
g
et a chance to s
ee yourself comoared with somebody else, you are apt to think
 
you are extremely insignificant. What he started was an annual folk festival, in
 
the area, and people began coming to it because it was so much fun. Actually,
 
woat he did, they first started out by having Saturday night sings in the church
 
and then people began to hear about that and they'd come in from further and
 
further out, and then these got to beso popular that in the a
i
l
  they'd do them
 
outdoors in the center of town in the twon square •  And then they began to have
 
square-dancing, and the little old ladies would start bringing in their jams and
 
jellies and quilts, and the old gentlemen bringing in their chairs and things to
 
sell. Gradually this Saturday night thing began to get so big that they decided
 
to have a whole festival of it, and they do that once a year. They have a week-
long festival in t
his small community, and it's now run by the Rackensack Folk-
lore Society, of which I am an honorary member because of my old friendship with
 
Jimmy Driftwood. It in entirely made up of the people of the community; Jimmy
 
doesn't even have anything to do with it anymore. It's their thing and they run
 
it. It's now an enormous production once a year, Jimmy in the meanti m
e having
 
gone to Washingtion an  pointed out that this was an impoverished community--
and it was —but now was doing very well, thank you, and he would like to have
 
a little bit of this poverty money that was going around to build a hail in which
 
to have their dance, because the could only dance outdoors during t
he summer.
 
And he got a million dollars 1 from Washington to set up the Rackensack Folklore
 
Society Memorial Hall in which they have exhibits year around, and the people of
 
the community, all of the sudden, are eating regular. It's really a model lesson
 
to u
s all. It started out very small, and it started out with people doing their
 
own thing —and the '-'ti l
l doing it in the way that they want to do it —but, t
he
 
interesting thing...Iaent a couple of students of mine who were going south...I
 
suggested they
-stop by and visit Jimmy, and they told me that in t
his little
 
area in Arkansas was the only place where they found that they could stop and
 
ask people who made quilts in the area? and everybody knew, and when they w
:nt
 
to see the quilt-maker she would stop and show them how she did it, because she
 
was proud of it —it wasn't just something she did becuase she didn't have enough
 
money to go to Sears-Roebuck and buy a comforter that was r
ide out of acetate.
 
She had a sense of value in what she could do, so she would talk about it and
 
:
how it to you, and talk about how to make those t
hied-apple dolls, and corn-
u
c  ;
lolls, and all the rest of those things, because they were important. They
 
er n t just becuase you were too poor to have a real china doll from the store,
 
I
'
r
iese -
ere now all of the sudden raised to the status of t
hings t
hat she could be
 
[ci1im tely proud of. And the same with the music.
 
So Jimmy has never lost his association with his. • .
his education didn't take
 
him out of the back woods. He still sounds like Uncle Hick from Punkin Crick
 
when he talks. He happens to have an MA in American History, and is extremely
 
knowledgable about it, and here be is demonstrating the musical bow in Carnegie
 
Hall. (
r thought you might like a little American music for a change, after all
 
of this world-wide stuff.) (RECORDED EXAMPLE)
 
You know, the inventiveness of man, I think, should be celebrated. That's
 
not an easy thing to think about, or to think about how anybody discovered it.
 
It was discovered, and it was discovered at distinctively different places
 
around the surface of the globe, that you could take a tightened string like
 
that, hold it up to the side of your mouth, and by moving your mouth around
 
get it to sound differently. If you ever want to try it yourself, you'll
 
discover that it's not really just a snap. My son worked on it for a while
 
with just a toy kind of bow we had around the house and he got so he could get
 
two or three notes, but to g
et a really good bunch of notes out of it you have
 
to work pretty hard at it, plus you have to shave down the edge of the bow that
 
comes up to your jaws, so that you g
et a little bit more resonance out of it.
 
Interestingly enough, Jimmy tells me that the seventh note of the scale is
 
t
he most difficult, and that he mostly plays pentatonic tunes on lt,because t
hat s
 
the farthest out in the series of overtones so it's the weakest, the hardest to
 
grah hold of. You might like to hear just a bit more on this. This i
s a musical
 
bow played slightly a different way. I think the first cut here is the ground
 
harp I was telling you about before. Let's listen to a bit of that. It doesn't
 
have much to it. (
RECORDED EXAMPLE) That's from Haiti; you heard an ideophone
 
of some sort, probably sticks, along with it. Here's a musical bow from equa-
torial Africa. ( CORDED EXAMPLE) (Voice-over: This kind of a bow has a gourd
 
t
ied on, and you can press that up against the chest and get the resonance of
 
the chest as well as of the gourd.) The arches harp, which is the classical kind
 
of thing you think of in connection with the harp, only smaller, 18 played in
 
Burma. (RECORDED EXAMPLE) Notice that it' s a very refined ins
 tr z
nent by now.
 
Apparently, these harps were once played all over Asia, but now you f
ind the-r
. in
 
sort of a few areas mostly like Burma and Th iland.
 
In the New World, the harp is mostly found in Mexico, where you find an e-
normous number of varieties of shapes and sizes of all cordophones. (RECORDE1
 
EXA PIE) The harp, though it's the oldest form, being a relatively simple in-
strument, has been more or l
ess wiped out by way of more complicated forms of
 
instruments. The one that most of us think about most frequently when we  think
 
about stringed instruments are various kinds of zithers. '
lthers are Eiven to
 
any stringed instrument without a neck; the resonant body itself used as a
 
string-.holder. So you have, in this case, the body of the instrunEnt...and
 
the strings go all t
he way across, this way (Drawing on board). There are a
 
number of different varieties of zithers, some of which are plucked i
ni some
 
of which are struck with hammers of some kind or another. The so-called hammer
 
dulcimer, that you see here in the United States, occasionally, is a zither act-
ually. It is shaped sort of like this, and it has strings that go cross-hatching
 
eachother, this way, in '
very complicated kinds of patterns, and you hit it with
 
little padded hammers. A lot of zithers are used in central Europe, where you get
 
the chimbalum (
???) and the Hungarian type orchestras .
.. let's see if I can spot
 
one out for you. (
RECORDED EXAMPLE) The famous Third Man theme was played on a
 
zither. You can either pluck them or hammer them. The thing to bear in mind about
 
zithers is that they're effecitvely all body; they are resonating boxes of one
 
kind or another with strings stretched all the way across them. This means that
 
when you're playing the things, you either have to go in a pluck them or go in
 
and hit them, becuase there is no way to deDress the string and alter its length.
 
There is no way to g
et at a string in something shaped like that, and depress its
 
length. They are then...you are stuck with the strings the way they are; you can't
 
shorten or l
engthen the string, you have to play within i
t.
 
Out of this particular family, a whole other series of instruments has devel-
oped that we are very a
ccustomed to. Can you think of what that would be? What's
 
a sound box with strings across it? Yes, a piano. The whole  iano-harpaichord-e1av-
ichord came out of the zithers, with a bigger box. And the player doesn't get in
 
there and strike it personally, although i
've seen this done in some avant-garde
 
performances —Henry Cowell used to write a piece (
he was an old avant-garde com-
poser friend of mine) and he liked to u
se t
he piano in all kinds of unconventiona'.
 
±
ys, and one of his favorite things to do was to leap up from the stool
, and go
 
md dive into the bowels of it and pluck the strings by hand, and then run  around
 
to t
he other end and bang on itsome more, and then leap up and pluck some more...
 
it was really funny to .
v
ateh. He looked kind of like Mr. O
'Llalley, and he h
ad to
 
stand on tiptoe to get into the inslies of the instrument. But it's just a more
 
fancy technological device for doing 
.
.. 
for playing a zither, that's all.
 
The next class is the Lyre. The lyre -
-
 t
he best way to visualize that i
s
 
that it is sort of what you remember as the Greek harp from the old pictures.
 
Most people think it is a harp, but it is not--it's a lyre. (DIAGRAM ON BOARD)
 
Lyres have, instead of a neck, a yoke of two arms connected by a cross piece
 
from which the strings reach down to a string holder on the box. Playing is u
saully
 
done with a plectron or pick. Dr. Sachs says that this family "once of paramount
 
importance in the Eastern Mediterranean, including ancient Greece and Rome, as
 
well as Palestine--King David played on a lyre, not a harp as the song tells u
s--
is today restricted to a few parts of northern and northeastern Africa, expeclally
 
to Ethiopia" which as I keep telling you, has a lot of very oddball things going
 
on in it. I
'll play you a little bit of a lyre. The sound-box is here and here,
 
as I understand it (
DIAGRAM ON BOARD) and this is one of the things that I have
 
questioned about the whole business of the classification: the reason that this
 
is classified as a lyre instead of as a harp is apparently because of these two
 
side pieces —all lyres have these two side-pieces--.but I don't see why it is not
 
a subdivision of t
he harp, frankly. I think t
his i
s the kind of problem I run into
 
from having learned my ethnomusicology out of books; none of t
he books has given
 
me a very good explanation for this. Some of you in the Music Department, go ask
 
them how come the lyre isn't a subdivision of the harp, would you? This i
s not
 
the kind of thing I remember to ask people at faculty meetingsL (
Student: are
 
either the harp or the lyre tuned?) Oh, yeah. You can tighten or loosen the
 
trings, sure. But it seems to me that just having two arms instead of one doesn't
 
seem that much of a difference to warrant a seperate classification. I
'm sorry
 
that's all I can tell you about it because I have looked it up repeatedly and they
 
keep saying the same bloody thing about it; it's not terribly informative.
 
Let me play you a little bit of how they sound, at any rate. It's not a very
 
frequent sound any more. (
RECORDED EXAMPLE) (Voice-over: it's typical of Ethiopia
 
that they've got a bunch of other things in there too; there's a drum, you notice.)
 
Now every-t
.
hingelse, fellows, i
s a lute. The lute is defined as having a
 
straight neck, projecting along the central a
xis of the resonator (
DIAGRAM ON
 
BOARD). There are about ten million forms of the lute, including by the way
 
the violin, the double bass, the cello, the guitar, t
he banjo, the mandolin,
 
not to mention all of the various oriental varieties. They may be plucked or
 
hit or bowed. They are more typically plucked or bowed; there's not terribly
 
much point in hitting the lute, and hitting things i
s less accurate than plucking
 
them or bowing them. The only ones that you hit are the ones that you can't get
 
at in many other ways.
 
I
'll play you just a sample or two. (RECORDED EXAMP L
E) (RECORDED EXAMPLE)
 
That was a shamisan (
??). That was .
.. there are techniques that are applied in
 
the orient for the construction and the playing of lutes where the string can
 
be, in co naxi parlance, 'wowwed', that is, it can be stretched so t
hat you can
 
get these bending kinds of tones. These are built in, in part, b
:
,
' the may t
hey
 
are constructed, and also by the way people play them; the Japanese in particular
 
like these sort of sliding tones, not the sort of definite pitches t
hat we seem
 
to like in Western music.
 
You have all heard so many lutes in the course of your careers t
hat I don't
 
think you have to go through the whole bunch of lutes •
 I thought it might be use-
fu]. if I made a few general remarks, at this point, and then gave you a list of
 
the instrument types that I think might be important to you. When you really come
 
right down to it, what we're dealing with here is t
echnology, musical technology.
 
All of these different callsjfjcatjons of insrumerits reflect a piece of inventive
 
construction that people have figured out a way to control the environment and
 
construct it into making musical sounds that they like. This has turned into a
 
rinciple of '
how to make a musical instrument, and there is a technology con-
nected with it. Each one of them has its own technaical points of distinction
 
then, in terms of the construction of the instrument, and each one of them, as
 
a class, represents a new invention, a new way of o
rganizing sound somebody
 
thought of, and then thought of a way to stabilize it and make it come out the
 
way t
hey like their music to sound. So you can u
se the number of classes of in-
struments that a society habitually uses or has invented. This kind of roughly
 
corresponds to the degree of complexity within a society, fairly logically.
 
And I
'm talking about complexity in the way in which we were talking about it
 
before, not in terms of bow elegant your ideas are but how complex your social
 
structure is. Because one of the things that you really run into in the casc of
 
instruments is that there has to be a supporting technology to invent or maintain
 
certain kinds of instruments. I
'm convinced that the reason we don't play bag-
pipes over here is because we didn't, at an early stage when people were emigrating
 
from Europe, have the supportive technology, and it took too long when the dingus
 
on your third valve of the bagpipe busted to send back to England and get 'nother
 
one. It's even a problem today; I talk to bagpipers in Santa Monica that tell me
 
that they have to wait for a month to get anything imported from England.. .
and
 
they know who to write and they can send an airmail letter, too. But if you think
 
about it in the days of the Mayflower, if you busted the fourth dingus on your
 
bagpipe, you i
ere just stuck with the thing, unless you could cobble something
 
up together, and then they don't usually work very well--those are rather com-
plex instruments. So you have to have a supporting technology; you have to have
 
repair, you have to have metal, you have to have, for elaborate instruments, a
 
whole supporting technology to make the instruments possible
—and somebody that
 
knows how to do it.
 
Again, it suggests a more complicated society in which t
here is division of
 
labor, the beginnings of manufacturing skills, complicated ways in which some
 
people can go into the musical instrument repair business. This is a little bit
 
different, you see, from visualizing what happens if your gourd rattle p
ets
 
busted--you just go out and pick another gourd, that's all. You don't have to
 
s
ake anything happen; this is why ideophones are the earliest instruments, be-
cause they involve the l
east fooling around with the construction of the thing
 
in order to make it work.
 
It seems to me that, if the Sachs classification works, and it seems to work
 
fairly well for most societies around the world, '
what it i
s really t
elling
 
u
s is not that people like certain kinds of sounds so much--because, as we've
 
already heard, you can make all kinds of sounds on all kinds of materials, nnd
 
the way a lute sounds in Japan is quite different from the way a lute SOUndS
 
played in Carnegie Hall by Jose Iturbi (
sorry, that's a zither, .
.. 
a lute being
 
played by Yehudi
. Menuhin (
?). The sounds you can produce vary enormously. It
 
seems to me that what we're dealing with here is, instead of a treatment of
 
the human voice, we are looking at a whole bunch of variegated technologies
 
t
hat people have developed out of materials that are available to them and for
 
certain kinds of reasons about which I
'm not completely clear, but I know it has
 
to do with the ability of people to handle metal, to handle wood, to
 
handle  he organization of the repeated activities that are necessary in order to
 
construct an instrument.
 
So one of the things that has cropped u
p that might he useful for you to
 
bear in mind is that if you look again at your world-wide sample, all over the
 
place, you can find that where you have orchestras of say two or just one instru-
ment type--accompanying orchestras —you find these generally in societies with
 
a very low level of any kind -of social layering. That is, everybody is more or less
 
the same kind of human being; there is a minimum degree of any kind of caste or
 
class differentiation. '
When you get up to accompanying orchestras of four or more
 
types of instruments, in big catagories, you find that there i
s an equivelant
 
classification system within the society, that pulls you into t
he existence of
 
five or six layers, or classes, or levels. Orchestras seem to have something to
 
do with this.
 
It is important to look not just at the specific instrnm nt, but how they've
 
combined, and how they are characteristically u
sed in groups. And the important
 
instrument types are the ones we've been going over. I don't have time to dic-
tate the whole list of instruments to you now, so maybe I
'll just run over it very
 
quickly and then I
'll give you a formalized list of instruments to note as par-
ticular classification types. They are actually the ones we have discussed: bows,
 
zithers, keyboard zithers, lutes, lyres, harps, horns, ribbon retds, clarinets,
 
oboes, bag
.ipes, flutes, bull-roarers, clappers, F
fongs, xylophones, bells, slit
 
drums, rattias, scrapers, Jew's harps, mbira, friction drums, stamp drums, and
 
kazoos (
which we didn't get to, by the way). How would you classify a kazoo?
 
Airophone ...
right.
 
(
(((I would have, just off the top of my head, classified the kazoo--if
 
as an instrument at all, as it merely alters the sound of the voice--as a mem-
branophone. The portion that vibrates is the membrane; it is the rattle of the
 
membrane that gives the kazoo It's characteristic sound 
.
.. 
a sound which I some-
times simulate by singing with a flat pick resting against the front of my teeth.)))

SOUND
 
Since this is a course in ethnological music, why begin with a
 
discussion of sound? Because music is made up of sound--music is or-
ganized sound.
 
Sound In Our Culture
 
1
.- Importance Of Sound.
 
Sound is a dimension that we generally down-grade in this culture.
 
"Seeing is believing." Things we hear are never supposed to be as ac-
curate as things we see. Indeed, one of the major difficulties in teach-
tr
ig a course in music is getting people to understand what 18 involved
 
in listening.
 
2.- Use Of Sound.
 
We use music (
sound) deliberately in our society to distract people
 
from the amount of noise that goes on in our society. We use it as a sort
 
of sound-baffle, so that people can concentrate on something else. Our
 
general association with music is that music is something that happens
 
while you are doing something else.
 
Examples
 
Muzak: People stop and stare when I sing along with Muzak. Why? Because
 
I
'm not supposed to be really listening to the music, I
'm supposed
 
to be concentrating on my shopping.
 
Radio: Those of you who study with the radio on do this to erect a sound-
barrier between yourself and the uncontrollable sounds of the out-
side world that might distract you. Music then becomes a signal
 
for you to study, drive a car, etc. Thus it is very difficult for
 
you to stop doing anything and only listen to music,
 
3
.- Eye-Ear Interaction.
 
We don't use any two senses equally at the same time. For example,
 
as soon as you start to look at something you turn your ears off. This
 
eye-ear interchange is very interesting and important.
 
Examples
 
School: In school you are trained to block your ears out in order to
 
read. All the attention goes to the eyes. We learn not to listen,
 
so that we can learn to use our eyes more effectively.
 
Concerts: Many people close their eyes when listening to music because
 
they know that the visual information will distract them from what
 
they are hearing.
 
Guitar-teaching: I find it almost impossible to communicate with reop1e
 
when they are playing; they are too busy reading the music and
 
watching their fingers to hear anything. I have found that with
 
the room-lights on each student plays as if alone; with the room
 
dark they all play together, because they are listening to each
 
other.

The Nature Of Sound
 
We will now study the nature of sound, so t
hat we can develope
 
a common vocabulary with which to discuss the organized sound, Music.
 
1
.- Sound and Movement.
 
Something has to move in order that sound exist. In terms of
 
ordinary human perception, stillness and silence go together. Physics
 
tells us that sound is composed of sound waves, and these waves can
 
only be produced by movement.
 
This movement may be human, animal (bird-songs, whale-songs), or
 
it may even be inanimate (meteor noises, etc.). For the purpose of our
 
discussion of human music, however, we will consider only those sounds
 
made by human movement.
 
. - What Does '
Sound' Sound Like?
 
Demonstration: thumping on table. "What does it sound like? How
 
would you describe this sound (
thump)?"
 
Synthetic Method. (
Student says it sounds like a parent talking to
 
a child.) You can describe a sound in terms of an equivalent sound. I
 
have banged my hand on the table, and you are associating that with an
 
accompanying speech. Charles Seeger says t
hat music is a system in and
 
of itself, which cannot be handled in terms of any other communications
 
system. But if that's true, then we'd might as well give up and go
 
home.
 
Pitch. (Student says; "Low.") The sound can be described in terms
 
of pitch —the '
highness' or '
lowness' of the sound. Pitch is a function
 
of the frequency of the sound waves, the number of waves that strike
 
the ear in a given time, so we are still talking about sound in terms
 
of movement.
 
Can we sing the pitch of this thump? Acutally, it is rather pitch-
less, except for the general perception that it is '
low'. Why can't we
 
sing the pitch? Because there is too much noise in the sound. (

What Distinguishes '
Sound' From '
Noise'?
  
1.- Sonograms.
 
The sonograph is a device that plots a sound on a graph in terms
 
of the frequency of the sound. (Diagram: sonograms of pure tone and of
 
'
thump' sound.)In the sonogram of the '
thump', what is happening? There
 
are so many frequencies coming all at the same time that you cannot
 
distinguish any single base pitch. Thus, a major distinction between
 
'
sound' and 'noise': noise has a confusion of pitches, all sounding at
 
the same instant.

.- How Much Noise Is Required To Make A Sound '
Noisey'?
 
Definitions of
 and '
noisey' vary from culture to culture.
 
Some cultures like a lot of noise in their music, and some like very
 
little. We tend to prefer relatively '
pure' tones, but we don't like
 
our tones to be too pure. Why? Probably- because human tones aren't com-
pletely pure tones and what we like about music is the human noise
 
factor that comes in when humane blow into, hit, etc., an instrument.
 
Examples
 
1- The fiddle parts I like best are those with rasp, scrape, and other
 
'
noise'; they involve some human commitment.

How Are Sounds Organized Into Music?
  
We have d
etermined the distinction between noise an: musical tone,
 
and that sound is made up of multiple pitches. How might those pitches
 
be o
rganized into music?
 
1
.- Pitch.
 
Theoretically, there are an infinite number of pitches, just a
s
 
there are an infinite number of frequencies to produce them. ,
Practically,
 
however, there are limitations due to the construction of our ears. We
 
can hear only a limited range of frequencies. Other animals can hear
 
freqencies that we cannot hear (which i
s why your dog howls a
t sirens).
 
2
.- The Principle Of Social Unison.
 
Demonstration: Male-female whole-octave disparities.
 
All cultures recognize intuitively the mathmatical relationship
 
we call the '
octave': when people of different vocal ranges singe to-
g
ether, they do so at
-whole-octave intervals: the frequency of the
 
pitch sung by the baritones i
s exactly twice that of the basses; the
 
frequency of the pitch sung by the tenors, exactly twice that of the
 
baritones, etc.
 
We in the 20th century have shown this by measuring the frequencies
 
with sophisticated machines. But whther we understand it, we have been
 
able to recognize and u
se this principle for c
enturies. It i
s a basic
 
notion of Man.
 
questions  
(
Sound In Our Culture)
 
Student: Why i
s i
t easier to study to music? I
s it just one sound to
 
s
hut out the other?
 
Response: 1
.- Music i
s organized sound, and as such it i
s predictable.
 
Random, human noise i
s unpredictable, and we are always wondering:
 
"
What was t
hat bang?" or "
Who was at the door?". 2
.- In this cul-
ture we have assigned the noise-baffling role to music; we have
 
been very highly trained to r
eact in this way to music.
 
Student: Don't different kinds of music have different functions? Not
 
all music fits the sound-baffling funtion.
 
Response: Some music is composed to fit the sound-baffling function and
 
other music isn't. But we are so well trained, and so constantly
 
exercised in non-listening by t
he o
smnlpresense of the Muzak sound,
 
that it i
s difficult for u
s to control the r
eaction. Our training
 
i
s so thorough that our eyes take precedence all the time • There
 
are many people who have never listened 100% to anything; they
 
h
ave never been in a group that allowed the devotion of one's en-
t
ire attention to music. It's a shame —but it has made a literate
 
society out of us. Turning our oars off has improved our eyes an
 
awful l
ot.
 
Miacelany

.- A student brought in an mbira, saying it was broken. It developed
 
t
hat the reason she thought it broken  was that it rattled.
 
In our culture, when something rattles, you fix it. A machine is
 
not supposed t
o have a rattle in it. This fits our cultural preferences
 
in other areas as well: it i
s no accident that we are very good machine
 
people. Many o
f our proverbial expressions r
efer to smoothness and neat-
ness of operation.

.- We are a very wordy people. We like to talk a lot; we like our
 
songs to be full of text. Bob Dylan puts a whale of a lot of words
 
into his pop music, and everybody tunes right in. We have been singing
 
ballads for centtries, and ballads are nothing but words •  Bob Dylan
 
fits our cultural style. We like complicated iy Tcs because we like

Page two). The last two lines are my own attempt to form a tr n-
sition to the next topic. You may not agree with my interpretation
 
of your drift.
 
2.- (
Page two). Two co m
ments:
 
1.- I disagree with the comment in the text that the popularity
 
of electrronic instruments arises from our preference for rather
 
pure tones. I have always been impressed with the amount of pure
 
noise to be found in most electronic instruments (
and I
'm not
 
referring to their volume). The amplifiers are generally bad and
 
add various hums and crackles to the sound; but also there are a
 
reat many gadgets that are used to add even more noise to the
 
r
stem: '
fuzz' tones, for example. Even after all this, most rock
 
t
;erformers use intentional feedback distortion, as well. Electric
 
pianos and Hammond organs have very dirty tones.
 
2
.- Those instr u
ments which do have very pure tones give us the
 
creeps. The therumen (
ep?) is a good example —it's nothing but an
 
oscillator...very pure tone. It is used to give a feeling of non-
i
t
nan-ness, weird and unearthly presence.
 
(
i
'age one). Nicky and I both respond to this, but in differing
 
ways. Neither of us uses music in the way you describe (although we
 
agree that most people do use it that way...this is probably due to
 
our having been raised in musical families). When Nicky concentrates
 
she can't stand having any local noise; she can take outside noises,
 
but she can't stand the faintest local noise. When I study I like to
 
erect a noise-barrier as described, but it can t
 be music; music has
 
to musch flow to it, a come-hither quality that I can't ignore. I like
 
to study to TV or radio if there is talk or other non-music noise--I
 
even like the sound of TV when the stations have gone off the air —but
 
I can't study to music.
 
Incidently, although you and I may find ourselves singing to the
 
Muzak, it could be worse--Nicky dances to it.
