Oh, beautiful Major Gilfeather! 
The ladies remark with a 
sigh; 
Oh, gracious! oh, my! did you ever 
Observe such a 
beautiful eye? 
The choicest of choice conversation, 
I 
give to the ladies, oh, dear! 
In hotel, in parlor, in station, 
Oh, this is the language I 
hear: 
Cnonus. 
Oh, how is the Major Gilfeather7 
Pin a 
little bit under the weather! 
It's smilingly, then I'd endeavor 
To borrow a 
five, do you see? 
Oh, take it, and keep it forever, 
My friendship for you cannot sever, 
For yclu are so royally clever! 
Oh, meaning the Major, that's me! 
To dinners I'm often invited, 
It's out of my style to decline; 
With rapture and joy I'm delighted, 
And often prostrated with wine; 
The ladies they say l'm bewitching, 
In fact, I'm a 
real Belvidere! 
In ball-room, in parlor, or kitchen, 
Oh, this is the language I 
hear: 
Oh, how is the Major Gilfeather, etc. 
The tailors and barbers all know me, 
They're envious of my great success, 
They say, conic and pay what you owe me, 
I 
give them my name and address; 
I 
leave them to mingle with fashion, 
Their voices grate hard on my ear; 
*When hungry and needing a 
ration, 
Oil, this is the language I 
hear: 
Oh, how is the Major Gilfeather, etc.

I 
have an old companion, John Riley from Tralee, 
In fair or cloudy weather, John Riley's seen with me; • 
His heart is like a 
mountain, his honor ye can't buy, 
But elbow bending is his fault, John Riley's always dry. 
CHORUS. 
Bass' ale by the pail 
He would order Rosanna to go out and buy, 
Dublin Stout he would shout, 
Keep drinking and never say die. 
"Whisky prime, gin and wine. 
He would hand down a 
bottle and merrily cry, 
Mv Rose Aim fill the can, 
'or honest John Riley's dry. 
It's every morning early John Riley's out of bed, 
Sure never a 
feather bolster lies under Riley's head; 
It's when the sun is rising, so eager and so sly, 
He slips out for his bitters, boys, John Riley's always dry.. 
Bass' ale, etc. 
His father often told him when John was but a 
youth, 
That every mortal Riley all died from whisky drouth; 
Of course it is a 
failing, the poor man can't deny, 
'Tis but a 
freak of nature, boys, John Riley's always dry. 
Bass' ale, etc. 
••  
What puzzles all the doctors John Riley's ever met, 
Is fresh or salty water tmn't make John Riley wet; 
Sure he must have the liquor, rum, brandy, gin or rye, 
And should he miss the bottle, boys, John Riley'd surely die.

I 
parted with my Susan Jane, 
I 
gave her substantial advice, 
She said, don't you think I 
am lovely? 
I 
answered, I 
thought she was nice; 
Just standing in front of the mirror, 
She said, I'm a 
sweet looking lass; 
If you wish to see what a 
beauty I 
be, 
Oh, please, come look in the glass. 
CHORUS. 
The mirror's the cause of it all, 
It hung in a 
frame on the wall, 
She'd stand up before it, and really adore ite 
Saying, Charley, now turn up the gas; 
'Twas awfully awkward for me 
To court in the light, don't you see? 
She said, ain't I 
tall, don't sit near the wall, 
But, come over and look in the glass. 
Whenever I 
called upon Jane, 
Quite full of ambition and hope, 
I 
seat myself down by her side, and 
At once she'd suddenly slope, 
To fix up her bangs by the mirror, 
She'd sigh, and she'd say, oh, alas! 
If von wish to see the nice dimple in me, 
Oh, please, conic look in the glass. 
The mirroes, eta 
I 
took her one night to the play, 
She had on a 
beautiful hat. 
The curtain went up, and she went out, 
It, caused me to look very flat; 
Escorting her out through the audience; 
To the usher, she said, let me passl 
Sit down, they hollered, but Susan I 
followed, 
To find a 
large looking glass.

Superstition it crept upon me,

GRANDPA'S chair is vacant, 
Near the fire in the grate, 
Where he told his tales of boyhood— 
Kept the little ones awake; 
One eve, so worn and weary, 
Sleeping on his knee they lay, 
Death called that night—like the fire bright, 
Grandpa passed away. 
CHORUS. 
So let the room be cheerful— 
Place the old arm- chair 
Where we talked to grandpa, 
With hi g 
silv'ry snow-white hair 
How he'd watch- the falling a:1m*, 
And sadly meditate, 
Gently sigh, we all must die, 
Like the tire in the grate. 
One bitter night in winter, 
The snow fell fast and wild; 
A 
girl looked in the window— 
A 
careworn, hapless child; 
Then grandpa whispered, 
And toddled to the gate, 
To save from sin he brought her in, 
Near the fire in the grate.1 
So 
the reorx be cbeerful, etc 
Keep the fire burning, 
'Tis charity's bright flame, 
Reminding of the evening 
The orphan Mary came, 
So ragged, cold, and hungry, 
With grandpa from the gate; 
For him she kneels, a 
pray'r she yields, 
Near the fire in the grate. 
So let the room be cheerful. oz. 
Lord bless old Massa Lincoln, 
An' de day he took de pen, 
Set free de little children 
An' a 
million colored men. 
And when you kneel for evening pray'r 
Good madders you must pray, 
For Massa Lincoln up in heav'n 
On 'Mtuacipation Day.

Oh, the rose of Kentucky and me, 
Long ago old massa set us free; 
I'll tell you what did happen in her good ohl mother's 
cabin 
To the rose of Kentucky and me. 
On the banks of the Ohio River, 
Where the winters are so cold the darkies shiver; 
One night about eight, we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
CHORUS. 
• 
On the banks of the river, that old muddy river, 
She lived on the banks of the river; 
And one night about we joined the married state, 
The rose of Kentucky and me. 
When they tried to win my rose away from me, 
My wife alons she said she'd be; 
Yet their vanity she flattered, and their hearts she al-
ways shattered, 
'When they tried to play that game on me, you see. 
Her voice filled this darkey full of glee, 
She's as merry and as busy as a 
bee; 
I 
love when I 
look at her, she's black, but that's no 
matter, 
She's just the shade I'd have my darling be. 
On the banks, etc. 
Since I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife, 
We have lived together, free from care or strife; 
And it's natural to suppose, we had a 
little Rose, 
For so sYweetly flowed the summer of our life. 
Yet the winter of our days will come, . alas! 
When spring, summer and autumn, too, will pass; 
Hand in hand we'll glide away, and I'll bless the hap-
py day 
When I 
took Kentucky Rose for my wife.

I 
am thinking to-do y 
of dem years dat passed away, 
When dey tied me up in bondage long ago; 
in old Virginny state, it was dar we separate, 
And it filled my heart with misery and woe. 
bey took away my boy, he was his mother's joy, 
From a 
baby in de cradle we him raise; 
Ch, dey put us far apart, an' it broke de old man's heart, 
in dem agonizing, cruel slavery days. 
Cnonus. 
bey never Jorne again, let us give our praise to Him. 
Who looks down whar de little children play; 
So every night and morn, we will pray for dem dat's gone, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slavery days. 
Still my inem'ry will steal o'er, to dat dat dear old cabin zoos, 
When de shadow of de sun came peeping in; 
At night when all was dark we would hear the watch-dog bark, 
And we'd listen to the murmur of the wind. 
It seem to say to me; " You people must be free," 
For de happy time am coming, Lord be prais'd 
For then we would weep and moan, for our souls were not 
own, 
In dem agonizing, cruel slav'ry days: 
Dey never come again, etc. 
I 
am very old and feeble. and our life am nekrly done, 
I 
have traveled in the roughest kind of road; 
Thro' sickness, toil and sorrow, I 
have reached the end at last. 
And I'm resting by de waystde wid my load. 
Forget now and forgive has always been my guide, 
For dot's what's de golden Scripture surely says; 
tut our ruem'ry will turn route,' when our souls dey were ties,

Scenes of my childhood arise before my gaze, 
Bringing recollections of bygone happy days, 
When down in the meadow in childhood I would 
roam; 
No one's left to cheer me now within that good old 
home. 
Father and mother they have passed away, 
Sister and brother now lay beneath the clay; 
But while life does remain to cheer me I'll retain 
This small violet I 
plucked from mother's grave.

As she used to greet me when I 
returned from toil; 
Always knitting in the old anti chair. 
Father used to sit and read for all us children there. 
But now all is silent around the good old home; 
They all have left me in sorrow here to roam; 
While life does remain, in memoriatn I'll retain

Though thy precious burden it has lied. 
How we miss the locks of curly golden hair, 
Peeping from thy tiny snow-white bed,

EMPTY IS THE DOG-HOUSE, TOWSER'S POI-
SONED. 
Sung by Woobsus & ALLEN'S Minstrels. 
Once I 
had a yellow dog, his name was Towser Jen-
kins, 
A butcher cut his tail off with his cleaver; 
Towser had his trade-mar k 
on every, cat in town,. 
And when he tackled one he'd never leave 'er. 
His nose was full of blisters, where the cats chewed 
off his whiskers, 
But empty is the dog-house where we ties him, 
A 
policeman spotted Towser, put some arsenic in his 
grub, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
Cflono. 
He's gone to hunt for rats in the happy hunting-
ground, 
He died this morning as the sun was risin'; 
The fleas have all turned out for to find a 
new lunch 
route, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
How 
that dog would grin when he would see a 
tramp, 
He used to put bay-Windows in their breeches; 
His legs were worn off stumpy. chasing milk carts 
round the country, 
He had bunions on his knees from jumpin' ditches. 
He'd corns upon his ribs chasM' rats around corn. 
cribs. 
And when he'd catch 'em how he'd paralyze ' em; 
But lie got up and dusted when his chest- protector 
busted, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned. 
CHORUS. 
He's gone to hunt for liver, way ur Um Swaney 
River, 
His muzzle and his collar are in pawn; 
The p'ison made him sad, and he eat his livc:-pati, 
Empty is the dog-house, Towser's p'isoned.

In that fair old land of Scotland far away.

Come to your laddie once again;

SALLIE HORNER. 
There's a 
little girl that charms 
The world as well as me, 
With her eyes of blue, so sweet and true. 
And heart so free; 
Many hours, and the flowers, 
Do I 
pass with her; 
Sallie Horner, round the corner, 
Little one so dear. 
CHORUS. 
Now I 
wonder, as I 
ponder, 
If she's true to me? 
If I'm any, of the many— 
Will she constant be? 
None completer, none is sweeter 
In this world of ours; 
Salle Horner, round the corner, 
In her home of flowers. 
You'll discover how to love her 
If you only try; 
You'll be given gleams of heaven 
If you catch her eye; 
Like the stars that gleam and glisten 
in the azure sky, 
When she speaks the angels listen 
As they pass her by, 
Now I 
wonder, etc. 
She is very sly and merry 
In her rogueish way; 
I 
adore her more and more 
In all my love- lit days; 
Always suing, fondly wooing 
For her heart's divine; 
Sallie Horner, round the corner, 
Oh, she must be mine. 
Now I

Three little leaves of Irish green, 
United on one stem; 
On Irish soil are often seen, 
They form a 
magic gem. 
One leaf is truth, and valor, one, 
The other one is love; 
And these three magic leaves are wet 
By dew-drops from above. 
Cuoitus. 
Oh! the shamrock, the shamrock, 
The shamrock immortal and green, 
By .ev'ry nook and every brook, 
Cirows shamrock so green. 
Oh! do you love, oh! say you love, 
The shamrock, emblem of love. 
Oh! say you love the shamrock so green. 
When Irish soil received the plant, 
The Ellin kings can tell; 
Love, Truth and Valor wandered there, 
And liked the soil so well. 
Each left an emblem in a 
leaf, 
And these together grew, 
Sustained by heaven's warmest beams, 
And nurtured by the dew. 
Oh! the shamrock, etc. 
To thee I 
give the triple leaf, 
As emblem of in 
love; 
I 
only hope the modest gift, 
May not unwelcome prove. 
A 
flower of more pretentious worth, 
Could not more plainly tell 
The triple faith I 
have in thee, 
Thou shamrock of the dell. 
Oh! the shamrock, etc.

MARY OF THE WILD MOOR. 
tt was on one cold Winter's night, 
As the wind blew across the wild moor, 
When I1Iary came wandering home with her babe, 
'Till she came to her own father's door. 
" 
Oh ! father, dear father, she cried, 
Come down and open the door, 
lr the child in my arms will perish and die, 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor. 
"Oh! why did I 
leave this dear spot, 
Where once I 
was happy and free, 
But now, doomed to roam without friends or home, 
And no one to take pity on me." 
The old man was deaf to her cries, 
Not a 
sound of her voice reached his ear, 
tut the watch- dog howled and the village bell toile& 
tlx ,: 
wind blew across the wild moor. 
But how must the old .man have felt, 
When he came to the door in the morn, 
Poor Mary was dead, but the child was alive. 
Closely pressed in its dead mother's arms. 
Half frantic he tore his gray hair, 
And the tears dew n 
his cheeks they dia 
Saying. 
This cold Wit,tees night she 
and Mae 
By the cold wind that blew across the wild moor> 
The old man in grief pinned away, 
And the child to its mother went soon, 
And no one, they say, has lived there to this day, 
And the cottage to ruin has gono. 
The villagers point out the spot, 
Where the willow droops aver the ACOhr, 
Saying, " There Mary died, once a 
gay village brier% 
By the wind that blows across the wild moor."

Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
From every Gothic winder,

Its buildings are tremendous, 
The population is stupendous, 
The citizens conscientious—

Men from Italiana 
Play harps and the pianner, 
In a 
Lazeroner manner, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Policemen from headquarters, 
Watch Italy's fair daughters, 
And the lager-beer importers—

THEY'VE ALL GOT A WIFE BUT ME. 
Written and sung by BEN. BODGX 
A 
story true I'll tell to you, 
Of the troubles of my life; 
Though in love I've been—like many other men— 
I 
never could get a 
wife. 
For the girls are so shy ( but I 
can't tell why), 
And sad it is to relate; 
Though I've tried and tried, till I've almost died, 
Still I 
cannot find a 
mate.

Oh, they've all got a

Who clerked in a

Each day I 
dressed in all my best, 
And wandered past the door. 
I 
wrote her a letter (oh. I 
ought to know better), 
And asked her to share my lot; 
Next day I 
met her " feller," and he thumped me in 
the smeller. 
That was all the answer I 
got.
