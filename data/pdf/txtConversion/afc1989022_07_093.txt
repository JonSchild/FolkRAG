TIAW-RF-A001= 
Born March 16, 1960 in Sicily. Came to U.S. at age 4 (1964). 
Language: not Italian, Sicilian. "There's a big difference." 
Dad started fishing age 8. Nino was 18: dad made him finish high school. 
Never been back to Sicily, would love to go, has relatives there. 
One of five kids. Younger brother works in engine room (Robert), older 
(Eric) builds scaffolds. 
Most recent fishing trip to San Clemente, 55 mi. away. They go where the 
spotters tell them to go. Spotters have been used since mid-seventies. 
He's married with three kids. He'd want his boys to fish. "It's a good 
life. I wouldn't do anything else." 
Dad came to U.S. year or two before rest of family. Fished tuna few 
years, then bought his first boat, then bought a bigger boat with partners, 
then bought the Maria T (his mom's name) by himself. Boats usually named for 
family members. 
Trips overnight -- if they catch fish. Fish mackerel all year round, 
some bonita and tuna in summer. Mackerel goes to cannery. Not much stays in 
the U.S. Japan buys a lot. Maria T a 64-ft. purse-seiner. 
Family worries about their return: "No. You leave the house and it's 
I'll see you when I see you." Tough on the wives. "It takes a special kind of 
girl to be a fisherman's wife." 
Uncle a tuna fisherman in San Diego. 
Fishing in Sicily today: No power blocks or spotter planes. "They do it 
the old way ... When they catch a thousand pounds, they had a good day. We won't 
even look at a thousand pounds " Good day for Maria T is 60 ton. 
Description of set. Fish scooped in, suctioned out. Big fish still 
unloaded by hand. 
Maria T has 7-man crew. Most of her crew is Guatemalan and Salvadoran. 
Address: 1107 23rd St. Phone: 548-6984. 
Shrinking of the SP fleet. In the old days, "you could almost walk from 
one side of the wharf to the other acros the boats...It's not the fishing 
that's dying out, it's the markets." Cannery has no storage space, has to 
impose limit on fishermen. 
Future: "You can always find fish to kill. You gotta find the market, 
but fishing'll be here forever." 
Fish & Game: If you catch sardines, say, you have to dump 'em. Half will 
die. But sardines are plentiful again. 
Eating fish: ate it three tines last week. Don't eat much mackerel, 
prefer rock cod. 
Wife's Italian-American, cooks some Italian. Dad "has to have his pasta. 
He's got to eat it at least one meal a day." 
Food on board boat. Accommodations. Recently rebuilt cabin. 
Story: caught 200 tons blue mackerel, but quota closed, had to dump 
them. "Supposedly there was no blue mackerel left." 
Not too many Slays left, except the few big tuna boats. 
Boat owners bought Starkist Cannery in 1987. Now called United Food 
Processing. Starkist tuna cannery now in Samoa. Pan-Pacific still packs tuna, 
last one in U.S. 
If out in the daytime, they'll catch rock cod with hook-and-line for 
their own meals. 
Description of set. 
Dangers: heavy equipment, bad weather, daydreaming. 
(side B) 
Net-mending. "Lacing? This is easy." Was 15 when he learned how. Dad 
wanted to keep him away, but he always wanted to be a fisherman. "It's tough 
life. It's not like, you work on a salary, yiu're gonna get your $2000, $2500 
0, 
" 
Ac-c) I 
1 0 
bucks a month. With us, we can go out and work every night, if we don't catch 
any fish we don't make any money." 
Story: Fishing anchovies outside Pt. Fermin. The St. George set first: 
300 tons. Pulling net, got three-quarters in, started to list, boom bent over. 
Spotters: Two groups of 7-8-9-10 boats. Aruguments: "That was my school 
of fish last night. What are you talking about? I saw them first..." Gets 
vehement when it's a matter of tuna, $1,000-$1,200/ton vs. mackerel, $150/ton. 
"Different story when someone snakes you out of a school of tuna." 
Worst fishing swordfish: "Always in bad weather, always away from home." 
On anchor 14 days in Monterey. "You're not making money that way." 
Wouldn't want to be a fisherman in Italy. Dad never been hungry since 
he's been here. Dad's dad fished. 
Nino's not an American citizen. Came from Sicily as a kid, didn't 
realize he wasn't automatically a citizen. Dad away fishing tuna during much 
of his childhood, never took care of paperwork. 
(helicopter going over) 
on being Italian: "It's hard to hold on to your roots when you're so far 
away." Speaks Italian, his wife wants him to teach the kids. Wife a member of 
Italian-American Club. "Every Italian that's got a little patch of dirt grows 
tomatoes and squash." He grows carnations. "I don't think you walk into my 
house and say, this is typical Dago." Front porch isn't painted red. Dad has 
his tomatoes, fruit trees. What's typical Italian: marble floors, tile 
everywhere. 
(fisherman just back from Alaska] 
Didn't go out looking for Italian girl. Wouldn't marry one if he had to 
do it again. Grew up with mom doing everything: "Most Italian men are spoiled 
because their wives and their mothers and their sisters would do everything 
for them ... Then it starts to bother them." 
He's one of six kids; mom did most of the parenting while his dad was 
away tuna fishing. 
(guy back from Alaska talks about how he did) 
Differences betwen Ischia and Sicily: dialect, food. "Whenever he does 
something wrong I tell him because he's from Ischia. We use it to burn each 
other." Sicilians called Africans by Ischians. 
(more conversation with guy back from Alaska, says he brought back a 
fish "with Exxon written all over it"] 
His wedding: 500 people, "everybody tapping on the glasses...I guess it 
was a traditional Italian wedding... polkas for the old folks, rock and roll 
for the younger people."

Born 11/12/34. 
In Sicily they catch less fish, but get more money per pound. Use lights 
to find fish there, here sonar and spotters are used. Life here is 100 times 
better than in Sicily. 
Was on a tuna boat, gone 3-4 months at a time when his family first came 
over. Hard on everybody. Life more comfortable on the big tuna 
boats. 
Language: spoke no English when he came to U.S. Parents, sibs already 
here when he came. Father came 506 years before Vito did. Mother's father was 
a shoemaker. Father's father was a cop. Father and all sons were fishermen. 
Vito was 7 when he started. Went from quarter to half to full share. 
(helicopter noise] 
Quotas: blue mackerel fishery closed, but fishermen kept catching them 
and having to dump them. Last year, Vito was put on year probation because he 
was over five percent of total catch limit on sardines. You can't control what 
goes in your net. 
Fish and Game inspectors always on hand at cannery. But if it wasn't for 
them, "we'd catch all the fish in the ocean." When you've got fish in the net 
and they're dead, it's a shame to throw them away. Can't have even one 
barracuda on the boat. Reserved for sport fishermen and gill-netters. Likewise 
sea bass. 
Discouraged his sons "100 percent" from becoming fishermen. It's not how 
hard the work is, it's the hours you have to put in. "If you got a steady job 
on the beach, you're home with your kids, your wife every night." Sorry he 
chose to work instead of staying in school. Doesn't care about a family 
fishing tradition. Just wants his kids to have a better life. 
Went back to Italy 10 years ago. Mother-in-law said she's living like a 
king: "-Now at least we see a piece of bread over here.— Vito scoffs. 
Remembers eating meat once a year, at Christmas. 
Retirement: Not any time soon. Only 55. 
Luck: Don't put hatches upside down (or boat will sink). They never 
catch a fish on St. Joseph's Day (March 19). Never start a trip on Friday. On 
St. Joseph's you're supposed to light a fire in the middle of the street. "We 
still go out (on St. Joseph's Day) but not with the feeling to catch a fish." 
Religion: goes to Mary Star once in a while. 
Gardening: grows tomatoes and squash in backyard. Used to eat pasta once 
a day. "If I don't eat pasta once a day it wasn't a day." Second wife more 
American, down to twice a week. Bread's got to be on the table every meal. 
Maria T named after first wife. Standard practice among Sicilian 
fishermen. 
Sicilian boats used to be prettily painted. Not here. 
Father still alive, 81 years old. Speaks no English. Stopped fishing 15 
years ago. Has two brothers in San Pedro, one in San Diego. Three of four are 
boat owners. The other is a merchant seaman. 
Best fisherman isn't necesarily the one who makes the most money. 
There's the luck factor. 
(side 2] 
He and his two partners put down $2,500 to buy a boat, which burned up 
in fire: Anna Maria II. No insurance. Harbor Dept. paid for it. Sold his 
share. Maria T built 1967. He's a member of the co-op, one of 18 boat owners 
who bought the cannery. Two Slays, the rest Italian. 90 percent of boat owners 
are Sicilians. The 
rest are Ischians. 
He and his boys are blond and blue-eyed; nobody believes they're 
Sicilian. Mother's family from Poland. 
Most of his friends fishermen, most are Italian.

Q_ 
Net-mending boring. 
Wife belongs to Italian-American Club . He doesn't . The women have more 
time, he says. 
Fishing in Sicily: used explosives. "We were more stuoid than the fish 
becasue we never figured out how much fish we killed." That's what's ruined 
the fishing industry in Italy. 
Full moon : the fish stay down deep and don't school up. Spotters can see 
them better when it's dark. Spotters get percentage of catch from all 10 boats 
they serve.

How his boat got the name Coquetta, built 1949-50. 
He was a "tuna man" for many years. Sardines. WWII stint, Korea. Fished 
tuna for 15 years locally after war, then went south on big tuna boats out of 
San Diego. Retired 13-14 years. Still fishes with his brother. Brother died of 
heart attack while the three brothers were fishing; haven't fished much since. 
Another brother fell overboard and drowned: "That takes the grind out of us." 
Was deck boss in San Diego for Westgate Cannery, 25 years. Trips varied 
from one month to eight months on the Mary Lucille. Then gave it up. 
Swordfishing out of San Pedro. "We were not really high-liners, but it paid 
off." Fished Panama, Ecuador, Honduras. Six-month tours to Africa, fishing 
with helicopters on board. "Very interesting in life in fishing. I liked it." 
Job as deck boss was "to be sure gear was all good...I fished from knee-high 
til today." 
Five brothers. He's the only one with a high school diploma. One brother 
cooks on the Tootur. Fishing slow now here, good in Samoa, where the canneries 
now are. 
Born in SP, Oct. 3, 1923. Five boys, four girls. Father immigrated to 
Boston, met mother, Mike and Joe born, moved to Monterey. 
"Fishin's s really changed today. Years ago it was all pullin gear and 
nets by hand. Now they have big power blocks and hydraulic things that pull 
all your gear and makes fishin very very easy." 
Father's from Sicily, town of Taormina, probably. He has no desire to go 
there -- doesn't know anybody there. Has five albums of pictures at home, many 
of foreign fishing ports. Father was fisherman, in Italy and in SP. Uncle 
Cosmo an old-time fisherman in Monterey. Has cousins who worked in Monterey 
canneries. Didn't grow up speaking Italian. Son Michael, 40, has fished, now 
works on harbor cruise ship. 
Comes down to dock every day to check boat -- it was broken into last 
year. "I'm down here seven days a weeek, 30 days a month, just browsin 
around." Helps Gerrard (Fiorentino), they cook together. Then goes home, tends 
his "victory garden." "I go to bed early in the evenings and I get up early --
get up at 4 o'clock, go down to coffee shop and see the boys and stuff like 
that, if there's any good fish to eat and there it is, always fresh, nothing 
stale. Good fish we eat." 
Lunch with Gerrard, 9-10 o'clock. "WE eat so good that all the 
freeloaders come around ... But they're our friends, we don't say nothin." 
Brings food to brother Mike, who's 79. Lives with sister and brother-in-law. 
Nephews in Sonoma co. 
Fishing slip been there at least 50 years. Used to be lumber dock. Now 
you see walkers and joggers and people picking up aluminum cans. Boats have 
groon from 2-man to 10 or 12 man crews, up to 25 men on the big tuna boats. 
Nets 800 fathoms long. Today wd cost half million dollars. Built tuna net in 
Panama worth $72,000 20 years ago 
Coquetta goes out for week at a time to Channel Islands. Used to do a 
lot of hook-and-line fishing for rock cod. Now depleted. No more swordfish 
either. Blames sportfishermen for catching fish before they spawn. Last year, 
saw no swordfish in nine days. $400-$500 for fuel per trip. Flags used on 
bamboo poles and buoys so you can go look for more fish after harpooning some. 
Maintenance. Painting, starting up once a week for half month. Coquetta 
been in family since 1949. A lot of people would like to have it, but they 
want it for nothing. 
on oldtimers coming down to the slip: "We chatter, who caught this, who 
caught that... If I wanted to go fishing I could get a job, but I'm 66, I'm not 
in it for the money." 
Father and brothers owned small boats. He always crewed on the big tuna 
r 
boats, never owned one. No albacore these days. Big San Diego boats crying the 
blues. Foreign boats setting 40-50 miles of net. 
Tuna boat crews mostly Portuguese skippers, Portuguese & Italian crews, 
later Mexicans, Koreans, Africans. "I fished with every nationality there 
was." 
Leisure: while traveling to fishing ground, usually spent working on 
gear. Brailers: big hoops, 7-8 ft. in diameter. "After you make your set, you 
pull your fish alongside with the skiffs, you sack up your fish real tight and 
you brail em down there, an dscoop in the hoppers and they go down the chutes 
to your wells." Can hold as much as 3 tons at a time. Log fishing. 
He was deck boss many years. "Once the skipper says let the net go, we 
let a big skiff go and make a big circle, 800 fathoms, you know what I mean. 
It's my duty to make sure the net's coming back in the boat and all the fish 
is coming back too. If you're gonna start rippin and losin fish you'll make a 
bad name and I don't think I've had a bad name in all my years of fishing." 
Describes porpoise fishing -- using porpoise to find the tuna. Disputes 
that American fishermen killed porpoises. 
Favorite fish to eat: rock cod, mackerel, anchovies. Cooks with garlic, 
onions, parsley: "Italian style." Cholesterol problems. Eats pasta once or 
twice a week with Gerrard. 
Big fish stories: 20-30 ft. basking sharks. They carry tuna also. How to 
release fish you don't want without killing them. 
Satellite weather info; accidents at sea; singing on boats: cook named 
Pappy played guitar and accordion. "There's always somebody with a guitar on 
boat." Guys who were broke would sell them for 50 cents. Showed movies. 
Luck: not going out on Fridays. Story of why doughnuts have holes: 
jammed on spokes of ship's wheel. Telling dirty jokes on the bridge while 
looking for fish. 
[Woman on wharf asks if fishermen are catching any swordfish] 
"If there were any swordfish I'd be out there right now, be on the mast 
all day, get some good breeze and eat at night time, get good sleep. I eat and 
I sleep at home but it's always good to get out there." 
Net-mending: "I don't say I'm the best. I can sew." Story of net and 
chain getting wrapped around prop off coast of Panama. "Any kind of net you 
can put together with your eyes closed, but the better it's put together, 
it'll fish better. You don't just choke it up. The net has to be built with a 
lot of slack, a lot of play. When you set you got to have a lot of play, that 
way you let the fish mill around, swim around. If it's choked up, they're 
gonna find an entrance, they're gonna get out of your net." 
Tuna boats: 100-150 sets per trip. Wear and tear on gear and men. Skunk 
sets: no fish. Made many nets from scratch, "from nothing to something." Spent 
three weeks making net in Panama. Sewing is "lacing and tacking, that's all 
that is." More on need for slack. 
Fishing today: long trips hard on family. "Nowadays everyone has a 
wristwatch and a styrofoam coffee cup. I hate that." Risk of watch getting 
tangled in net. 
Tidiness of the Coquetta. 
[Guy comes by who wants to buy it.] 
His nickname is Lemons. Used to make lemonade in summers. Boat's cook 
nicknamed him Lemons. 
Coquetta built by John DiMeglio in 1949.

Born Jan. 30, 1930. Father came from Italy in 1910s (born 
1898). Mother came 1922-23. Met in San Pedro. From Ischia. Father came via 
Marseille and Algiers, where he worked construction. Related to Elias Canetti. 
[friend stops by] 
Father was Italian, but he was always first an American. Wanted American 
flag on his casket. 
[friend: "I can call you a Dago and you can call me a Dago but if 
somebody else called me a Dago, then I'd get hot in the ass."] 
Father was always in grocery business. First store 16th and Mesa. When 
Joe was a baby he was put in a toilet paper box in the store. Sold groceries 
to the fishermen. Not strictly Italian food. There were no Italian restaurants 
til the 60s. Now there are seven. Cooks were cooking ont eh fishing boats. 
When the fishing got bad they opened restaurants. "Right now it's not fishing. 
Second generation Italians are all lawyers, doctors, dentists. Man I'm telling 
you, the Italians are all spread out throughout San Pedro now." Realtors, 
restaurants. 
Mother had three brothers in San Pedro, all in fishing business: LA Fish 
& Oyster (DiMassa). Mother died 1987 at age 87. Dad couldn't read or write; 
mom kept the books. Aunt and uncle never became American citizens, aunt was in 
a camp in the desert for six months. Nighttime blackouts in SP during war. 
Joe's older brother and sister spoke Italian, but during WWII, the emphasis 
was on speaking English. Brother Frank an insurance man. The whole family 
worked in the grocery store. 
[pause to turn fan off] 
In 1945, family store was on the dock, in what is now Ports O' Call. 
Moved to the present location in 1949. Joe opened his own restaurant in 1958. 
Took over dad's restaurant in 1962-63. Building owned by City of LA. On 30-day 
permit. Dream of franchising: Canetti's for Spaghetti. Makes a living off the 
fishermen, the longshoremen, the fish market guys. Boys taking over the 
business. 
Has three boys and four girls. Oldest son works on the barges, went to 
Piney Point merchant maine academy, in SIU, works for Crowley (Nick). Named 
after Joe's dad. "The first son in the Italian family has to be named after 
the father." Daughter Joanne named after his mother. 
Meals: "Sunday was mostaccioli-macaroni day. Thursday was a macaroni 
day. Monday was a soup day." 
Fish Friday. Saturday steak. Sunday the big 
family visiting day. Adults played cards; kids went to the movies. 
Italian-Yugoslav conflict. Dad had shotgun in bedroom. 
[side B] 
Italians' porches were green. Slays white and blue. Dad had fruit trees: 
peaches, plums, oranges, tangerines. Dad moved out to San Jacinto after 
retiring. Planted string beans, fava beans, fruit trees. Italians put zucchini 
flowers in batter to make fritters. Wife makes ravioli from scratch. Holiday 
menu "would blow your brains: cracked crab, fresh oysters, steamed clams, , 
linguini with pasta, pizza, shrimp, spaghetti with crab sauce, abalone." 50 
people every Christmas Eve. Father insisted on eel. Always had jug of wine on 
the floor. Made his own. Bought a ton of grapes. Stomped the grapes. "All the 
Italians had cellars. They don't know what a cellar is today...In the forties 
we had every Italian making wine here." 
Holidays: Christmas Eve was the biggest. San Giovan Giuseppe events 
included climbing greased pole. Before the war were the days of "the real 
fiestas." San Gennaro, patron saint of Naples. Blood flows from his hands. 
Italians here donated money for San Giovan Giuseppe fiesta in Ischia. 
These days, the boys work Sundays, so the family gatherings are any day 
of the week. Used to close 1 p.m. Sat. and reopen Mon. Now, with competition 
from Denny's, etc. they need to be open Sunday. "The real Italian thing, it 
was, but it isn't today." Because everyone has to work more. People aren't 
moving out of SP, though, because there's always work: fishing, longshoring, 
truck-driving. 
Italians in SP still strong. Sicilians still speak Italian first, 
English second. In 1960, Sicilians came: hard workers. Go to Alaska to fish 
salmon in June for month and a half. Make $25,000 to $40,000 in that time. 
Two-man boats. Alaska license sells for $150,000. Ischians didn't go to 
Alaska. 95 percent of fishermen in SP now Sicilians. Ischians have moved up 
and out, got out in the 60s. "They're a breed of their own and they work. 
They're not like the gangsters from New York." In the 60s, fishewrmen were 
sinking their boats to pick up the insurance. More Yugoslays than Italians, 
according to Joe. 
Christmas: The family visited 20 other households. Trani's shoe store on 
7th street. Brothers make sandals. Johnny and Tony. Common names: John, 
Joseph, Vincent, Tony, Frank. 
Blessing of the Fleet: Sept/Oct. It was different when there were 100 
purse-seiners. 
He comes into restaurant every morning at 4:30 to make doughnuts, cakes. 
"Fishermen catch more fish in Canetti's than they catch out in the ocean." 
Info exchange. From 6 a.m. Sat. a.m. fresh fish markets open to the public.

Born July 23, 1918 in Plentywood Montana. He's 
not Italian. His wife is. She's from a large Italian family: five sisters and 
a brother. Last name Giacopuzzi. First name Irma. She's born and raised in SP. 
Hewas raised an orphan in SP , worked in grocery stores 
[phone) 
Worked 20 years in grocery stores, became head of retail clerks union 
for 20 years. 
Italian Mutual Benefit Society prior to WWII. Disbanded toward end of 
war. Restarted by Ben in 1951 as Mazzini Club. 12 oldtimers from original 
lodge joijned new one. Ben was first president. Club lasted 30 years. 
Memorabilia turned over to SP Historical Society. 
Reason for restarting. Observed at funerals that people were so happy to 
see each other, that there ought to be a better vehicle for them to meet. No 
label of being northern, southern or central, but other Italians joined Sons 
of Italy or Italian Catholic Federation out of Mary Star. Sons hall in 
Torrance. 
"The club was family. We said whatever we did had to be good for the 
whole family or we didn't do it." Monthly meetings, dinners, picnics, monthly 
dances in rented halls, Grew to be 150 men. 
Most northern Italian: Lavarini, Marconi, Benedetti, Fasani, etc. Most 
from Verona area, southern Alps. Were farmers in Italy, operated farms and 
dairies between SP and LA. switched to dockwork durting the war. Next 
generation stayed with longshore or become professionals -- doctors, lawyers, 
teachers. Few went into business. Fun-loving, home-loving people. Played 
cards, made their own wine and sauerkraut, sausages, butchered goats and pigs, 
grew vegetables, raised chickens. "They liked nothing better than a houseful 
of people having a good time. They found one way, through this Mazzini Club, 
of carrying on their culture from Italy." 
Young people joined Elks, became involved in church or sports 
activities. 15,000 Italian-American names in SP phonebook. Younger people, 
more affluent, had cabins in the mountains. Club "put into deep sleep" in 
1984. 
Northerners came 1913-early 20s. The men came first, settled into a job, 
then sent for wives. SP had ideal climate and work -- even during Depression. 
PT-AOA 3 
A working man's town. Unions strong. Now becoming more residential, resort-
like. Northerners and southerners got along fine, but their lives were 
separate. Language different, food different. Fishermen from Naples, Ischia 
and Sicily. 
Italians used to live on the flats, near the port. Now many have moved 
up the hill, become professionals. Until 1940s, there was little inter-
marriage. Northerners and southerners didn't inter-marry much. Northerners eat 
little fish, more chicken, pork and veal. His wife's extended family, 600 in 
Italy, 400 in California. None of the dairies exist anymore, victims of 
development. Some of the men worked in dairies and on the docks -- unloading 
lumber, principally. Some of the women worked in the canneries. 
Northerners "assimilated into American culture so completely that it 
would be difficult, except if you go to a wedding a funeral, to discover that 
they had the ethnic background that they do." Now, he estimates there are 
around 100 extended northern Italian families in SP. Southern Italians have 
expanded. Attributes the good life of SP to the ability of its various ethnic 
groups to live in harmony. 
He thinks it's a good thing the club disbanded because it's a sign of 
greater affluence and broadening of interests and horizons. Bond of Italian-
ness means less. Most of original northern immigrants have died out. 
"These folks are great eaters. They love to eat. And they love to 
dance." 
Old families: DiRoccas and DiCarlos (exclusive social group; Camparsi 
(busines group); Sicilian group. Most northerners belonged to ILWU. People to 
contact 
Mother-in-law never learned English. Italian POWs kept in Carson, let 
out to go to dances on weekends. Music provided by Italian orcherstras. 
Predominant instrument the accordion. 
Northern Italian food: chicken, pork veal, less sauce on the pasta, 
gnocchi, lasagna, tortellini, polenta. Not too many vegetable gardeners or 
wine growers anymore. 
More on the Mazzini'Club: where the meetings were held.

fishing in Sicily. Differences between the fishing in Sicily and fishing here. 
Hand work vs. power block. Birds and flowers were painted on the boats in 
Sicily. Fishing industry subsidized in Italy. Here the sport fishermen have 
more influence than the commercial fishermen. 25-30 boats in Terrasini when 
they left. Pop. 16,000-17,000 now. Poeple still want to leave and come to the 
U.S. "They don't have much education, but they got a lot of brains when it 
comes to making a living." 
The voyage over. Landing at Ellis Island. 
[grandson and family arrive] 
During storm, only the fishermen continued to eat. Didn't stay in New 
York: family waiting in Detroit. Didn't know anything about the Statue of 
Liberty when they saw it. "No education, we must have had a lot of guts to 
leave the old country." Both brothers were 15 when they came over. The train 
trip from NY to Detroit. 
Breakfast in Sicily: piece of bread and a couple of sardines. No butter. 
Bread dipped in olive oil. Espresso "so think you can't even drink it." They 
brought American coffee with them when they went back to visit. "It's not 
coffee, it's tar." 
Now Sicilians are learning to speak "real Italian" in school. The 
dialect they call slang. "The real Italian language is beautiful," says 
Antonia. Joe speaks a little Italian, his son, none. Phil says he learned 
English from his kids. Everyone on the boat spoke Italian, but he said, "This 
is an American boat, not an Italian boat." Wanted everyone to speak English. 
Sam's and Antonia's sons understand Italian, but don't speak much. 
Sam's parents wanted him to leave the country before his 16th birthday 
so he wouldn't be drafted: Italy and Yugoslavia (Austria) were at war. Uncle, 
back from Detroit, paid his way. FYve years later he wanted to come back, but 
with Mussolini in power and the threat of being drafted again hanging over his 
head, his father advised against it. "Stay there," his father said. "If you go 
to war from there I'm pretty sure you're gonna die with a full belly, but if 
you come in here you're not gonna have no belly, nothin. Over here what you 
left, it's a little bit worse than what you left." 
Phil tells a similar story. "When I came here, I came here to die here." 
When he came to SP there were about 20 Sicilians, 100 Italians overall. The 
Italians all got along. Roomed with two guys, paying $5 per month apiece. For 
$33.33 cents apiece they bought a net. Talks about how plentiful the fish were 
in those days -- inside the harbor. Bought two boats, both named 
Conte di 
Savoia. Purse seiners. The second one was 78 feet long. During WWII, the 
Japanese fishermen were taken to camps, leaving the fishing to the Italians 
and Slays. 
Antonia: Difficulty of waiting for husband to come back and raising kids 
by herself. Had short wave radio. 
Fishermen's Fiesta: there were 125-130 boats involved. 3,000 tons a fish 
a day came in, 400,000 tons per season. 10,000 tons of sardines brought in per 
day, 350 purse seiners. "Looked like a city, all the boats had nets in the 
water, with all the lights." Mostly Italians and Slays, but a few Norwegians 
F, •- A  O0 S, 2-
from S.F. "There was no place in the harbor to tie up." During and right after 
the war, until 1951, was the best time for fishing. 
Phil brought Joe to Mexico fishing when Joe was 6. Strict control of 
ingress and egress from harbor during war. During war Phil bought a small 
boat, the Linda. Fished for albacore. Hard to find crewmen during the war, 
everyone was in the service. The brothers fished together some, but most of 
the time, each had his own boat. Joe's the last fisherman in the clan -- part-
time. "There's not really a bright future in it as a living." 
[Sam tries to get up while still attached to microphone. Joe says, 
"You're gilled in a gill net."] 
Phil quit at age 75. Misses fishing. But at age 83. Has a bucket waiting 
when Joe comes in. 
Problems with sea otters, gov't., sport fishermen. Sam and Antonia have 
five children, 10 grandchildren, 9 great grandchildren. Sam's grandson was 
interested in fishing, but his grandfather quit just as he got interested. 
"It's in the blood." 
Name traditions: successions of Josephs. This Joe is an engineer for 
Northrup. His wife, who's Japanese cooks Italian. Learned from Antonia. He 
"occasionally understands" Italian, but doesn't speak it. 
Family dinners and picnics. Traditional meal: pasta with tomato sauce, 
barbecued chicken and steak, Italian sausage. 
Christmas: traditional cookies and pastry.

Born July 23, 1918 in Plentywood Montana. He's not Italian. 
His wife is. She's from a large Italian family: five sisters and a brother. 
Last name Giacopuzzi. First name Irma. She's born and raised in SP. Hewas 
raised an orphan in SP , worked in grocery stores. 
[phone] 
Worked 20 years in grocery stores, became head of retail clerks union 
for 20 years. 
Italian Mutual Benefit Society prior to WWII. Disbanded toward end of 
war. Restarted by Ben in 1951 as Mazzini Club. 12 oldtimers from original 
lodge joijned new one. Ben was first president. Club lasted 30 years. 
Memorabilia turned over to SP Historical Society. 
Reason for restarting. Observed at funerals that people were so happy to 
see each other, that there ought to be a better vehicle for them to meet. No 
label of being northern, southern or central, but other Italians joined Sons 
of Italy or Italian Catholic Federation out of Mary Star. Sons hall in 
Torrance. 
"The club was family. We said whatever we did had to be good for the 
whole family or we didn't do it." Monthly meetings, dinners, picnics, monthly 
dances in rented halls, Grew to be 150 men. 
Most northern Italian: Lavarini, Marconi, Benedetti, Fasani, etc. Most 
from Verona area, southern Alps. Were farmers in Italy, operated farms and 
dairies between SP and LA. switched to dockwork durting the war. Next 
generation stayed with longshore or become professionals -- doctors, lawyers, 
teachers. Few went into business. Fun-loving, home-loving people. Played 
cards, made their own wine and sauerkraut, sausages, butchered goats and pigs, 
grew vegetables, raised chickens. "They liked nothing better than a houseful 
of people having a good time. They found one way, through this Mazzini Club, 
of carrying on their culture from Italy." 
Young people joined Elks, became involved in church or sports 
activities. 15,000 Italian-American names in SP phonebook. Younger people, 
more affluent, had cabins in the mountains. Club "put into deep sleep" in 
1984. 
Northerners came 1913-early 20s. The men came first, settled into a job, 
then sent for wives. SP had ideal climate and work -- even during Depression. 
A working man's town. Unions strong. Now becoming more residential, resort-
like. Northerners and southerners got along fine, but their lives were 
separate. Language different, food different. Fishermen from Naples, Ischia 
and Sicily. 
Italians used to live on the flats, near the port. Now many have moved 
up the hill, become professionals. Until 1940s, there was little inter-
marriage. Northerners and southerners didn't inter-marry much. Northerners eat 
little fish, more chicken, pork and veal. His wife's extended family, 600 in 
Italy, 400 in California. None of the dairies exist anymore, victims of 
development. Some of the men worked in dairies and on the docks -- unloading 
lumber, principally. Some of the women worked in the canneries. 
Northerners "assimilated into American culture so completely that it 
would be difficult, except if you go to a wedding a funeral, to discover that 
they had the ethnic background that they do." Now, he estimates there are 
around 100 extended northern Italian families in SP. Southern Italians have 
expanded. Attributes the good life of SP to the ability of its various ethnic 
groups to live in harmony. 
He thinks it's a good thing the club disbanded because it's a sign of 
greater affluence and broadening of interests and horizons. Bond of Italian-
ness means less. Most of original northern immigrants have died out. 
"These folks are great eaters. They love to eat. And they love to 
dance." 
old families: DiRoccas and DiCarlos (exclusive social group; Camparsi 
(busines group); Sicilian group. Most northerners belonged to ILWU. People to 
contact. 
Mother-in-law never learned English. Italian POWs kept in Carson, let 
out to go to dances on weekends. Music proyided by Italian orcherstras. 
Predominant instrument the accordion. 
Northern Italian food: chicken, pork veal, less sauce on the pasta, 
gnocchi, lasagna, tortellini, polenta. Not too many vegetable gardeners or 
wine growers anymore. 
More on the Mazzini Club: where the meetings were held.

Born Anita Ardina, Aug. 12, 1912. Grandparents (Carrese) 
came from Ischia to Wilmington, then San Pedro around 1880. Children were 
Brigitte (Stan DiMeglio's grandmother), Annie (Anita's mom), Alec and Henry. 
Grandfather was a fisherman. Henry was a boxer. Alec a bartender, then ran a 
concession in the ferry building. Mother made bread and cleaned houses for 
people when her husband died. 
Father worked in coal mines in Colorado, then lumberyard in SP. Started 
business selling wine grapes to the Italians and Slavonians. People usually 
bought a ton to make three barrels (c. 1915). Stan DiMeglio's dad became 
partners with him. Anita kept the books. Sept.-Oct.-Nov. were the big months 
for wine-making. Italians made white wine (Sauterne). Fishermen would wait til 
the full moon to make their wine, when they couldn't be out fishing. Everyone 
had wine cellars. 
How you could tell an Italian house: garden. "People lived very simple 
in those days. It's wonderful how we're so advanced, but it don't seem like 
that brought more happiness. It really hasn't because the families were so 
happy in those days, it seems to me, and satisfied with what they had. Today 
you don't find many people who are satisfied. They just want more, more and 
more. And people visited each other more." Her family was one of the first to 
have a TV, would have a crowd to watch, for example, the Rose Parade. 
Food: "For the Italian people the main thing on Sunday was always 
spaghetti and meatballs." And eggplant parm. 
[sister-in-law comes in] 
People were more friendly and you knew everybody. It's not that way now. 
Father lived with the DiCarlos (the bakers) when he first came to SP. 
There weren't pizza joints or espresso bars in those days. People made 
those things at home. 
Anita speaks Italian. Son can understand it. Was called a ha;f-breed at 
school because he was half-Italian and half-Slay. 
Holidays: Last Sunday in August, St. Giovan Giuseppe della Croce. 
Week-
long carnival, fireworks on the last night. 
Christmas Eve fish dinner: octopus, especially. The family still has 
such dinners. Anita brings the octpus salad. 
She's never been to Italy. 
Music: accordion music, danced the tarantella. Tug-o'-war during San 
Giovan Giuseppe. 
Recipe for an Italian sweet bread (for Easter).

Fishermen's Fiesta: Boats decorated with flags. Parade of boats to Long 
Beach and back. Blessing of the fleet. 
Fishing superstitions: Fishermen wouldn't go out on a Friday. 
San Giovan Giuseppe: statue was brought out during a storm and calmed 
the waters (in Ischia). 
She's Joe Amalfitano's godmother. His father owned the boat City of 
Naples. She has movies of the fiesta. 
Boats lost at sea. Retirees asked to come back out for one more trip 
who've lost their lives. 
Her husband owned the San Pedro Boy. "I used to dread to see him go, 
just dread it... It's a hard life to be separated lke that." Never encouraged 
his son to be a fisherman. Son's a microbiologist in Glendale. 
Italians more scattered now. "Some followed their fathers into fishing, 
but not too many." 
Italian houses: vegetable garden in front instead of lawn. Kegs of salt 
sardines in the house.

"It  doesn't mean that much to me to be of Italian descent because I feel

country betteer than this country. If you want to work the least you live 
comfortable."

Born Sept. 3, 1930 in Ischia. "All fishermen and farmers at 
the time that I left." Father from a family of four boys and one girl. His 
father worked on sailing ships, died. Dad born 1898. Fishing not that good on 
the island, left for the states at age 17. Had heard about the good fishing in 
SP. "Bring me to a place where there's fish and we'll catch it." Started with 
small 25-30-foot boats, lampara nets. Fished mackerel and sardines, later tuna 
for Starkist Cannery. Brought squid to markets, got higher price. Dad came in 
1915. Married in Italy in 1920, went back and forth, fathered seven children, 
decided in 1934 to bring family over with him. Delays with immigration, 
finally came over in 1937. 
Dad was building a boat at that time at Al Larson's Boatyard, 79-ft. 
long, 19 and-a-half ft. beam, draws 8 and-a-half feet, carries 100 tons of 
sardines: the Santa Maria, still in the family. Only boat in harbor still 
owned and operated by same family. 
Grandmother died of starvation, no food in Ischia. 
DiBernardo extended family has about 225 members, all in San Pedro. 
Went to Italy in 1983, first time back since he left at age 6. Island 
became "tourist trap" after the war. He quit fishing in 1964 after hernia 
operation, went to real estate school. Started fishing age 13. Dad couldn't 
fish during war because he wasn't American citizen. Worked at a laundry. Libby 
set pins in a bowling alley. At the time, "you could walk on the fish out 
there." 
First lived on 10th St. in a 2-bedroom house, then built a lot on 14th 
St. Older sister went to work at cannery. 
Fished til age 33. Brother Carmine still fishing. "You wanted to do what 
your dad did." Son followed him into real estate. Married an Irish girl. Her 
parents didn't want her to marry an Italian. The family's first house was half 
a block away from where his office is now. 
Italians lived from Gaffey down. Above Gaffey was "rabbit-hunting 
territory. They'd go up there to tar the nets until 1953 when nylon nets came 
out. Neighborhood was Italian-Yugoslay. Crews were all family. Most of the 
fishing done at night, come in in the morning, unload at the cannery with a 
hand brailer (scoop). "In those days you could walk on the sardines." 
Overfishing and pollution depleted the sardine population. 
Navy security restrictions in harbor during WWII. The rush to the 
canneries in the morning to unload. Unloading a 100 tons of fish took an hour-
and-a-half. Early boats sardines were canned, later ones, their catch 
beginning to spoil, were made into fish meal. Sardine season opened Oct. 1. 
300 boats, including boats from SF, Monterey and Tacoma. 
Spotting fish from the crow's nest. Now, with sonar, you can fish in the 
full moon. Wine was made in the Sept. full moon. Remembers stomping the 
grapes. "We're lovers, we're not fighters. None of the Italians ever wanted to 
go to war, believe me." During war Italian POWs at Ft. MacArthur. 
Dago Bank: 8 mi. southeast of SP breakwater (Angels Gate). Other fishing 
grounds, The Bubble Hole. The Barn. Channel Islands. 
Gill-netters: "Whatever runs into it, it kills." Controversy. 
(side B) 
Boat, Mission Belle, lost last year. Most accidents due to too much fish 
in teh net, causing boat to roll over. With cotton nets, the net would break, 
but not with nylon. Brother has a machete on boat in case it's too full of 
fish. "You hate to lose the fish ... but better to lose the fish than your boat 
or your life." 
March-April the windy months. SP protected because of indentation of 
coast below Pt. Concepcion. 
Summer bluefin tuna shows up, following the Japanese current. Stay out a 
O-Aoo•, •2 
week when tuna fishing . During winter, overnight trips. Yugoslays went for 
longer trips -- one-three month trips. Italians didn't like being away from 
family 
Language . He speaks Neapolitan dialect, not "good" Italian . Carmine born 
in U.S., but since Italian is spoken on the boat, he speaks more Italian than 
Libby. Son understands, but doesn't speak it. 
Never bought tomato sauce . Made own sauce , ravioli, gnocchi, bread. 
Bought six loaves for 25 cents from DiCarlo 's. Brought French bread and 
tomatoes to school , embarrassed because his schoolmates ate American style ham 
sandwiches . Had rabbits , chicken, ducks . Used to eat rabbits two-three times a 
week. Occasionally would butcher a lamb or a goat. 
Saturday soup day, Sunday ravioli or mostaccioli, Monday, pasta fajole. 
Saint day , March 19 just as big as Christmas and Easter. San Giovan 
Giuseppe della Croce (August ): Italians in SP donated for fiesta in Ischia. 
Feast not as big as it used to be. Carnival . Now just dinner and dance, three-
day mass , dinner and dance on Saturday night. 
Fishermen 's Fiesta: started 1946 , the heyday of fishing 
Decline of 
industry , problems with insurance , church-state problems with city 
underwriting event. Fiesta restarted 6-7 years ago , minus the boat rides to 
Long Beach . Blessed Virgin carried down to dock in procession. 
During dryspells , the priest would be called down to the boat to bless 
it. Fishermen superstitious about the evil eye. Mom used to burn incense on a 
dustpan and recite prayers, through burning incense into street to rid the 
house of the evil eye. Left pot of flowers outside in water overnight, then 
wash their faces in the water. Saints for different parts of the body: St. 
Blaise for throat, St. Lucia for the eyes. There was a man who went round to 
people's houses saying prayers over people to rid them of worms. 
Today, SP is 20 percent Italian, 20 percent Slays, 30 percent Hispanic, 
5 percent black. 
Italians trying to keep traditions , but it's not the same if you're not 
from "The Rock" -- from Ischia. Most of the changes have taken place since the 
war. 
Fishing industry suffering from foreign competition , canneries moving 
overseas . Carmine's crew all Italian but one. Crews don't speak Italian 
anymore. "When I was fishing it was 100 percent Italian. No one spoke 
English." 
Songs: Neapolitan songs the best. Would sing in the crows nest. 
Fishing fleet used to be heart and soul of the town, now it's shipping. 
Now down to about 30 local boats . Asked Carmine to take his kids out fishing 
for a summer to "learn the value of money." They went, but they didn't want to 
stay in fishing . Carmine's son works with Libby in the real estate office. 
Spotters , fathometers : "You don't have to strain your eyeballs to catch 
fish."

Born Oct. 20, 1940 in Ischia. Comes from generation after 
generation of fishermen. 
[Espresso is served. "That's the real coffee, see." Milk different here 
than in Italy] 
Was in merchant marine. 
Speaks Italian to his son: "They understand everything." Distinction 
between Neapolitan dialect and "high-class Italian." 
In merchant marine 1962. Married 1966. In 1963, jumped ship in New 
Jersey, went to uncle's restaurant in Poughkeepsie, worked as bus boy, nabbed 
by immigration after 17 days. Met his wife through friends. Sent home after 2-
and-a-half months. Last night "the worst night of my life." Wanted to get 
married at City Hall. Her father wouldn't have it: "The only time my daughter 
get married is when I bring her myself ... But I give you my word, the sky can 
fall on you, but you got my word, I'm gonna bring my daughter to you... That's 
what happened." Gave chain given by godparents at time of baptism to his wife-
to-be. Separated year-and-a-half. Wrote three letters a week. Still has them. 
Married, returned to states, to Peekskill, in 1966. "Be a fisherman, you 
can't get away, no way." Tried brother-in-law's construction business, but 
"once you're a fisherman, you're a lifetime fisherman. We say in Italy you 
have saltwater in your veins." 
His wife says: "You can never take a fisherman out of the water." He 
repeats this. 
Had uncle (Joe Amalfitano's dad, Frank) in SP. He went first, for a 
month. 
[Kids and nephews from NY come in, sit] 
Wife, expecting first child, comes west. Uncle's boat was City of 
Naples, now Santa Maria. Fishermen's strike, 6 months - 1967. Ended up worse 
than before. Tough time. Six months made $900. Was cheap to live in SP. Then 
he got colitis. Worked sick. Was able to buy house and boat with two partners. 
Fishing was bad, which made it a good time to take a chance. Bought boat for 
$210,000 in 1985. Sick 5 years. Never gave up, never pulled back on work. 
Belief in working hard 
Talks about beggars in India when he was in merchant 
marine. Kisses ground. "Work is no shame." Says in Italian, "Work ennobles the 
man." Father said, "Try to do your best. Doesn't matter what you do." 
Given 50-50 chance of making it after operation. But he knew he had to 
go to work and support family. Did work on his house without being taught how. 
Common sense, willingness to work. 
"I never regret I left Italy." Traveled to other places, no place like 
U.S. for opportunity - provided you're willing to work. Story of friends from 
Italy, couldn't speak English, she cleans house, now has successful carpet 
cleaning business. Can't understand how people who were born and raised and 
schooled here can be unemployed. People too proud to do menial work. "Pride 
don't fill up your stomach." 
[Side B] 
Friend, now dead, had same operation as him. Couldn't cope with life's 
ups and downs: "You can't have meat every day." 
Always wine on table in Italy. KIds began drinking it at age 4-5. 
Fishermen bought it from farmers. No one ever drunk. "If I want to celebrate, 
I'm gonna eat." 
Discipline: Father never touched them. One look was enough. Doesn't work 
the same way with his own family. Problem of kids getting spoiled in America. 
For him, one piece of candy was a treat, but he wants to give his kids 10 
pieces, 10 pairs of shoes. 
More about the lady who started out cleaning houses. 
It helped that there was Italian community in SP: "We all helped each 
other." 
Few Italians coming now. Life good in Italy. Tourism picks up in Ischia 
in sixties. Parents, aunts and uncles still there. 
Differences between his dad's boat and his own. Size, mainly. Bigger 
boats and bigger catches here. Life more easy-going there. Doesn't bother him 
to eat fish everyday. "What we throw away here you can eat over there for two 
days... Everything under the sun you got over here." Human nature: "The more 
you got, the more you want." Has four TVs in house. Phones in every room. 
(Daughter talking on phone) 
Wife was 12 when she came over.Parents preferred their kids marry 
Italians, but not an imperative. "Either I married him or I killed myself." 
Before they went out, his father required him to have blood test, physical & 
letter from priest in Italy. He complied. Wouldn't go that far with his own 
kids. She was 17, he was 23, had just jumped ship. Today, he's the favorite 
son-in-law, in part because he's Italian-born. 
Wife: "I don't mind spoiling my kids." 
Language: Kids understand Italian, but don't speak. 
She: "We like them to be Italian. We like them to be proud of what they 
are ... We like America, we're raised here, but we're sure darned proud that 
we're Italian." Kids have been to Italy once, will go again. 
Names: sons still named after grandfathers. "That's Italian tradition." 
Antonio so named because when he was sick, he made a promise to St. Anthony. 
Her mother's patron saint is St. Gerrard. She prayed to St. Gerrard while 
mother-in-law prayed to St. Anthony. Kid's name is Antonio Gerrard. Isidoro 
got well, bought a boat, "like a dream come true." 
Good year last year catching tuna, story in L.A. Times. 
Worried about kids - drugs, etc. 
Antonio won't let kids call him Tony. He wants to be a fisherman. 
Isidoro says, put your mind to school & later you can be anything you want to 
be, except a bum. Fishing a tough life. 
Differences between fishing here and in old country: spotter planes, 
Loran. 
TV helped him learn English. 
Older son fished with him summers, went to mechant marine academy in 
Piney Point, works on a barge in L.A. Harbor. 
Keep kids home until marriage, even until age 40. "We grew up that way. 
That's the Italian way. It would be a dishonor for us (if kids moved out)."

Talk about singing. Isidoro sings old Neapolitan songs, in the shower 
mainly. 
If daughter announced she was moving out before marriage, "I would kill 
her," he says, with a laughing. They call their way of teaching the children 
"brainwashing." 
Saints' Days. St. Anthony. San Giovan Giuseppe (patron saint of Ischia). 
Family party. "First of all we go to church, number one." Women make a big 
meal: Mostaccioli, lasagna, brasciola (sp?) meat with parsley, raisins, 
garlic., sausage, barbecue. 
In Italy, saints' day celebrations are bigger than birthdays. 
Christmas: "A big thing for us." Makes nativity scene, "not just the 
stable, it's the whole town." Clay figures from Italy - farmer, butcher, 
fisherman. Big Christmas tree. In Italy, his family couldn't afford one. Here, 
there are so many presents, you can't open the door. Nativity: newspaper made 
to look like mountains, sprayed with snow; lights. "You don't know the mess he 
makes," his wife says. 
Fishermen's Fiesta: Boats decorated with flags. An SP tradition (not 
from Italy). 
Easter: As head of house, he blesses the house. No meat eating from Good 
Friday to Sunday. Couldn't eat mother's pastry because it contains eggs. "Now 
we do. See, it starts to fade a little bit." Father "blesses me from the 
phone." Bless boat with palm. Bless the food. "All the time, we have somebody 
over ... My father used to say, if you feed eight, it's easy to feed nine." 
(Photos of Nativity scene shown] 
Christmas Eve dinner: Isidoro cooks - lobster, crab, clams, fried 
shrimps, calamari, bacalao, octopus salad. And for vegetables: broccoli, 
cauliflower, potato pie. Women make the vegetables. 
Christmas Day lunch: escarole pie, bacalao. 
Again, no one ever got drunk. His kids not allowed to drink. 
Story: 
when he was little he was given bread dunked in wine by grandfather to make 
him strong. Grandfather says a steak dinner is ruined by drinking milk or 
water with it. 
Daily meals: meat loaf, baked potatoes, cutlet with spaghetti or 
eggplant. No vegetable garden: they have a dog. Italian dogs bury bread.

Born July 25, 1921 in San Pedro. Address: 1540 Averill Park 
Dr., SP, 90732, 213-832-3249. 
Dad came 1911 as a single man, had married sister here. Went back, and 
joined Italian navy, married his wife on Armistice Day, moved back to SP 
worked as bandsaw operator at lumberyard, then became fruit and vegetable 
peddler. He wwas from Ischia, she was from northern Italy. Grandfather was a 
tailor and orchestra leader. Dad was a pianist. Frank played violin, clarinet 
and piano. 
Frank built own boat after war and took his dad with him until dad 
retired. Had two uncles who fished, owned their own boats. Frank started with 
them in 1937. His mom worked in the cannery. Transition to larger boats. Made 
$25 to $150 per week -- good money in those days. Automation began with marlon 
nets 1952, power blocks. "Things started changing pretty fast after that." 
His boat 48 feet long. carried 35 ton of fish. Four years later, 60-ton 
boat. Three years later went back to a 36-foot boat, carried 16 tons of fish, 
5-man crew. Last boat carried 155 tons, 11-man crew. All-Italian crews. Both 
Italian and English spoken on boat. "My mother spoke the pure Italian from 
northern Italy and my dad spoke the dialect from southern Italy." Frank 
married Slavonian girl. Has three kids. Oldest boy understands Italian, but 
doesn't speak it. Works in an automotive shop in SP. Sons fished, the otehr 
became an airplane spotter, crashed, now in real estate. 
300 boats in harbor during sardine season after WWII. 
Fishermen's Fiesta: Potluck meal on each boat, crew took families aboard 
boats. Decorating boats became very competitve: crepe flowers, netting, palm 
fronds. Blessing of the Fleet: public relations value. 
Fishermen's Coop: started 1927 by Slays. Italians belonged to Italian 
Boatowners Federation. Merged in 1947. Served as bargaining agent for 
canneries (when there were 25 of them), negotiated prices with unions and 
canneries on behalf of boatowners. Canneries began folding in mid-50s as 
sardines declined. 
Frank sold boat 1979. Doesn't miss it. "I had enough -- 42 years of it.
,, 
A good life, but a hard life. Usually fished at night and rested during the 
day. By not going to Mexico for weeks at a time "I got to see my kids growing 
up. 
(Ken Light joins us, briefly) 
By 1979 there were only two canneries left. Marine store started on 
slip. Coop building dedicated 1937. Coop bought the Starkist cannery in 1987. 
Four years ago cannery set a 25-ton per week limit on mackerel. Too low, as 
far as the fishermen were concerned. Price: $170 ton. Union agreed to drop 
price to $155 in exchange for 75-ton limit. Coop then planned to buy freezer 
to ship mackerel overseas. Starkist announced it was closing. "That," says 
Frank, "would have been the death knell of the fleet." So they decided to buy 
the plant. Building a million-dollar freezer. Bought by 20 boatowners. Problem 
now is, no fish. 1988 was a good year, 1989 slow. 
200 workers at cannery: Slavonians, Latinos, Samoans, Blacks. Used to be 
mainly Japanese, some Swedes and Italians. 
Share system: Frank started with half-share, three-quarters after a 
month, full after two months. Had to know how to patch nets. Now they work on 
a percentage basis. 40 percent for boat, 60 percent for crew. One boat made 
$112,000 gross last year (pre crew member). Average, $40-50,000. 
Ups and downs: brought home $10,000 in week, three or fourth months when 
he didn't make anything. 
Wife from a fishing family, she knew how to roll 
with it. "They make good money, but they make it in spurts." 
Sardines gone for 30 years. But there are more now than during the 
heyday. If they reopen it, they'll make a comfortable living all year round.

Now, 1000-ton limit. Opens Jan. 1, closes Jan. 4. 20 years ago the mackerel 
disappeared, the coop instigated a moratorium, the fish came back. His boat 
the Frank Boy II (now Nazarino) caught 10 percent of total ctach, 7200 ton of 
anchovies.

Unloading at the cannery: use of the brailer explained. Today they use 
suction pumps. Takes a ton a minute. 
Role of the cook on board the boat. Gets easier jobs because he has to 
be up cooking when rest of crew is sleeping. 
Fishermen are religious. Frank remembers one fisherman who kissed the 
fet of the statue of St. Joseph. Coins under mast. John DiMeglio one of only 
boatbuilders left. 
Nicknames: Frank known as Captain Morgan. On the slip, guys are known 
more by their nicknames than their real names. Wooden Head, Iron Head 
(translated from Italian). 
Naming of boats: after cities, saints, wives. 
Italian community clustered around 9th-10th-11th streets. Then they 
started moving up the hill, into the rabbit-hunting territory. "Everybody in 
San Pedro knew everybody. Not anymore." Less visiting today. Saturday nights 
they used to play Italian songs at his parents' house. Replaced by TV and 
radio. 
Singing on the boats? Not too much. "When you were on the boat you were 
there for business." When not fishing, the crew, exhausted, would sleep. 
Dangers: getting caught in net when it's going on. Used to be two men in 
the skiff, one on the oars. Role of the skiff during a set. 
Tanning nets. Slavonians switched to tarring. 
How gill-netting works. 
30-35 seiners in harbor now, and 50 gill-netters. 
Fishermen's union. Competition between fresh fish markets and the 
cannery. Coop members not allowed to do business with the markets. 
When fishing industry went down, some Italians switched to longshoring. 
Rise of anchovy fishing brought a few of them back. 
Boat launchings: sandwiches, soft drinks, champagne bottle cracked over 
the bows. Priest would bless the boat.

Gerrard born April 9, 1924 in San Pedro: "I'm a breast-fed 
baby." 
Father from Sorrento via Ellis Island. Mother's parents from Genoa via 
S.F. (left after earthquake.) 
Grandfather was a sea captain "like Christopher Columbus. He even used 
to dress up like him. Very strong, very handsome man. Kept fishing up to the 
age of 78 years old. They don't make 'em like that anymore. The good Lord 
doesn't have that mold anymore." 
Mother born in S.F., died when Gerrard was 4-5 years old. 
Italians from Genoa all became good business people. Some stopped in 
Santa Cruz. Not many in Monterey -- mostly Sicilians. Some in Santa Barbara. 
Most associated with gill-net industry. Some in San Diego. 
Father a grocer. Lost everything during Depression. Went fishing. 
Gerrard member of FBI: Full-blooded Italian. "And I'm proud of my 
heritage." 
(Gerrard helps a customer] 
Growing up Italian: "Italians are very lovable people. Very religious 
people ... When you've got religion that's 99 percent of goodness, regardless of 
what religion it is." 
Father built house in late 20's or early 30's. Horses used to dig out 
cellar, which was filled with canned goods: "We were like a cannery." 
Father made his own wine. "I used to help my grandfather. He'd make me 
wash my feet and I'd jump in his wine grapes. That's the way he used to smash 
'em, like he did in the old contry. He didn't use no grinder. He had me 
jumpin' up and down with my bare feet. He used to make me wash my fet. Then he 
had me jumpin'. We thought it was funny, my brother and I used to jump 
together. I remember like it was yesterday. And he used to make good wine by 
the way, beautiful wine." Father used grinder. Made wine, beer. 
(Another customer] 
As a fisherman, Gerrard got three deferrments during WWII. 
Victory Garden next to house. Big chicken coop in back. Lemon trees. 
"The lemon is very important in the Italian family." 
Cooking: "Virgin pure olive oil is a must." 
Holidays. "The holidays were special." Father well-known and loved, the 
fishermen would give Gerrard fish. 
Gerrard started fishing at age 14. Didn't go to high school. "Used to 
pull everything by hand." Lampara nets. Has owned two boats. First was Onward 
(owned 25 percent with Vincent Albano and the Starkist cannery) 
"Ninety-nine percent of the fishermen are born fishermen. Like Leonard 
Taormina, he was born as a fisherman... It's in your blood. It's a natural 
talent the good Lord gives you." 
Gerrard started at quarter share. Based on "drive, desire and natural 
ability." He and Leonard made (cotton) nets as kids. Nylon came after the war: 
"That was the salvation of the fishing industry all over the world." Then , 
later, the power block "which revolutionized the commercial fishing all over 
the world." G. helped design the first 56" power block in the world. 
Before sonar, fathometer and spotter planes, "you had to have good eyes. 
Forget about the fathometer. We used to smell 'em. I heard fish flip for 20 
miles...I was on the mast on the Golden Gate, which we named the San Antonino. 
That night we get a haul, over 200 tons of sardines. I actually heard 'em. And 
my partner said, 'You sure?' 
-I am sure.' I says, 'You keep goin' west.' Sure 
enough, there we found 'em in the bow. He couldn't believe it, that at that 
age I could hear, I had tremendous hearing. I was no slouch with my eyes 
either, T had good eyesight for fish. My eyes were trained for that kind of 
fish, for finding black spots. I got good eyes for black spots and I'm no

slouch at night fishing either. The most important thing is keep your mind 
thinking about fishing. At that age it's hard at times." 
Sewage pumped into ocean has ruined fishing industry. 
"Those days, you used to see the fish with your naked eye. If you could 
fight the elements, the weather and you had the drive and the guts to take a 
chance, you would produce. Otherwise you would not produce. I'm talkin' about 
the heydays when you could walk on 'em." 
Fish have changed their habits. Electronic age. "Meter fishing." 
Navigated by dead reckoning. 
Blessing of the Fleet : "The Fiesta was a wonderful thing as long as it 
was run by fishermen." Now too commercial, too many politicians involved. 
There ought to be more canneries , use robots. 
Quit fishing 1959. Wife ailing. 
Story about father-in-law dying while he was out fishing -- his last 
trip. Got into supply business, supplying tuna boats. Development of power 
block. 
Nickname : Father Gerrard. He brings fishermen who do business with him 
luck . Used to be called Captain Blood. 
Terms: Jag - big catch ; High-liner - like a baseball superstar. 
Portuguese the best tuna fishermen . Fishermen need more public support 
and more help from the politicians against foreign competition. 
Fishing heyday : "The war years. I don 't know what it is with the war 
years. God provides this great country with great resources because we must be 
just people ." After the war the fish disappeared . New sardine explosion. 
Fishermen should be able to go after them again. "I want to see the sardines 
canned before I die." 
Fished tuna in Mexico. Jack-poled : "This is no way to catch fish." Used 
to love being away before he got married . "Most of the wives that are 
fishermen 's daughters know the life that these men lead and they accept it 
when they marry this man." 
(phone call] 
"Money is just a tool ... Don't make it your God." 
He's the best in his business . Importance of "drive." Has no kids. 
Miss fishing ? "I can't cut the mustard anymore. I'm 65 years old, I just 
can't cut it. And I'm man enough to admit it. I run this business...I use my 
brains...I haven't got the strength. I still got the desire, I still got the 
drive and I still have the pride. The most important thing is pride. It isn't 
money no more with me. With me it's pride, desire and trying to help people. 
This is what keeps me going..." 
Compares older fishing to "bow and arrow." 
The law of the good Lord - "Everything's gotta balance and the American 
public's gotta understand this. What 's born's gotta die, as well as human 
beings, as well as fish, as well as mammals, etc. etc. But you can't destroy 
'em. That I'm against. But you have the natural cycle. These few fish get 
caught in gill nets. God did this for a reason. And by the way, Jesus was a 
commercial fisherman and he was purse seine man , not a gill net man. That's 
fact. That's fact. A lot of people don't know this, but this is facts." 
Didn't go to school, but has no regrets, would do everything the same 
way. 
Future of fishing fleet? "There'll be fishin as long as there's a world. 
As long as there's a world there'll be commercial fishing. This is the way God 
made the world." 
Average American too hungry, too greedy. 
Cooked spaghetti with sauce for lunch with Leonard. His love for Leonard 
KP- Av13, 3 
and Mike. Return to "can't cut the mustard" theme. "Once you pass 65 you're 
living on borrowed time. What do you want me to tell you?" 
Insurance up, fuel prices up. Fishermen are survivors. Spoiled by big 
money in the heydays. As much fish in the ocean, but more competition. 
"The Italians today, they tell their sons to be doctors, lawyers, 
whatever. Nobody wants them to get involved in the fishing industry. There's 
no future. And I don't blame 'em. It takes animals like myself." 
Sicilians best fishermen, even better than the oldtimers. Importance of 
jealousy. "You don't mean nothing by it. We'll spit in each others' face on 
the ocean. We get alongside the dock, we're on the beach, we're hugging and 
kissing each other. That's our way. We love each other." 
SP fishermen are high-liners. Gerrard supplies 99 percent of them. 
When he says there are 30-35 boats today he's talking about seiners. 
Gill netting's another industry.

Born March 13, 1920 in Mint Canyon, California. Father had 
left fishing to start turkey business. It failed, they returned to harbor 
area. Dad came from Genoa in 1899 with parents. Grandfather was a fisherman in 
Genoa. Daughter-in-law researching family history. 
Ed started fishing at age 12, got interested in the tugs while selling 
papers on the waterfront. Then worked for DiCarlo's bakery, became merchant 
sailor after high school, went to work for Wilmington Transportation in 1945. 
Italians and Slavonians lived in lower SP. Ed's mother from Livorno. He 
speaks some Italian, it wasn't spoken much at home. His kids don't speak it. 
Sailing career: cargo ships and tankers to south Pacific, India, Persian 
Gulf. Crews were mixed. 
Ed fished three years total, never cared for it, was "more mechanically 
inclined." First job on tug was as assistant engineer. Wilmington mainly does 
"ship assist" work inside the harbor -- docking ships and barges. Rarely went 
outside the breakwater except to tow rock barges, cattle, navy supplies to 
Chaneel Islands. Wilmington Trans has 8 tugs. Crowley Maritime and Pacific 
Towboat are the other companies in the harbor. Employ about 300 people among 
the three of them. Wilmington tugs carry capt., chief engineer and deck hand. 
Boats are 3500 horsepower. Assistant engineer has been cut. 
Tugs are good jobs for family men: "a lunchbucket job." Crews used to be 
70 percent Italian. Now more Slavonians than Italians. 
(phone] 
Ed's been port engineer and vice-president of engineering about 25 
years. Still goes out on the boats once in a while. Tugs "closest I can get 
(to going to sea) and still be home." 
Skipper's job: knowing how to handle ships, tie-ups, handling lines, 
working with pilots. Engineer works in the engine room. Tugs are 105-feet long 
by 34-feet wide. Engines have grown from 150 horsepower to 3500 horsepower. 
Relationship betwen tugs and pilot boats. Few Italians into piloting 
nowadays. 
Canneries, longshoring and fishing were always the biggest industries in 
the harbor and the ones that drew the most Italians. 
One of Ed's sons works at Wilmington. One's an electrician, one owns a 
Kentucky Fried Chicken. The electrician used to work at Todd Shipyards. None 
of the boys married Italians. Neither did Ed. He has 18 grandchildren. 
Phasing out of the fishing industry. Tuna boats forced to go further 
afield. Canneries have moved overseas. 
Family ate a lot of fish during Depression. He caught abalone and 
lobster. Family ate spaghetti and ravioli, cioppino. Italians made their own 
wine; many traded fish for vegetables with Japanese farmers. 
The longshore: containerization. Ships used to stay week to 10 days for 
unloading, now gone in 32 hours. 
Decline in shipyards from six to two, Todd closing down. Craig in Long 
Beach closed or closing. As a result of all this change, the town's not as, 
close-knit as it used to be. "Somebody in the family was working somewhere in 
the marine industry." 
(side B] 
Harbor Dept. staff, or at least its maintenance staff, has been cut back 
also. 
Ed's dad went to work in the fish markets when he sold his boat. His dad 
was 12 years old, mother 18 when they came over from Italy. 
"There's nothing here anymore. At one time there was a thriving 
community." 
Ed remembers seeing lumber schooners and squareriggers in the early 
twenties. Used to be several lumberyards where Italians worked.

to Catalina. Today, most Pedrans work out of town. Wilmington the only tug co. 
in SP. Crowley moved from SP to Long Beach. Wilmington has 60 employees. 
Al Larson's Boatyard on Terminal Island; Italian dairies in Carson-

TIAW-RF-A016=Interview in Italian 
Russell, Ken , and I are following Ferdinando Di Bernardo and his son Libby 
(Liberatore) around Ferdinando 's house where he shows us the birds that the 
youngest of his sons , a lawyer, keeps in a room in the backyard. The room is 
filled with cages of different sizes with birds of various kinds. Ferdinando 
calls his son "fesso " and "baccala" (fool or crazy ) because of his passion for 
birds, but says that his son is not the only fool in town : he has many friends 
who have the same hobby and they get together and talk about who has the best 
bird of all . Ferdinando does not take care of the birds at all; he does not 
know what his son finds interesting about birds. 
Ferdinando came to San Pedro (he says San Pietro ) in 1915. He is 91 years old. 
His older brother had been in the States since the beginning of the century. 
He was working in New York as a docker when Ferdinando arrived there. Some 
relatives in New York wanted him to stay and work in New York, but his brother 
wanted him to go to San Pedro with him and work as a fisherman. 
We continue the tour of the backyard and garden . The youngest son apparently 
takes care of everything . Ferdinando calls him "impiccioso " ( a busybody ? one 
who does many things ). I ask Ferdinando how he spends his days. He says he 
stays home and on sunday he goes to Mass. He takes care of the rabbits: he 
shows us the cages with rabbits and Ken takes some pictures of him holding one 
of them. The rabbits are raised to be eaten. 
We move to the front of the house . He tells me that his wife came from Italy 
in 1936 and at the time he was renting a house. Then during the depression he 
bought a lot on 14th street and Gaffey which he paid 700 dollars. "When my 
wife came i told her: Do you like the place? We'll build our home! The Bank of 
America lended me '36 cento' (36 hundred ? dollars ), because I had credit, I 
had the boat." He paid back the loan in a few years . Then the family grew big 
and 40 years ago he bought another lot and build the house where he actually 
lives and the adjacent duplex which he rents out. He goes on telling me "la 
storia e' grossa " (the story is big ). He tells me that in 1921 he went back to 
Italy to get married. At those times to take a girl away from her parents was 
difficult : from 1921 to 1934 he suffered a lot in America without his wife who 
had to stay and take care of her parents back in Ischia. 
We go into the house where he shows us a picture of himself with his three 
brothers taken in 1924. In 1937, when his family came from Italy, he build the 
Santa Maria , the boat which is still used by the family to fish.

TIAW-RF-A017=Interview continues from IAW-RF-A016. In Italian. 
We are in Ferdinando's living-room where a parrot talks. Ferdinando tells me 
an Italian parable about a parrot and a monkey. "A mio figlio gli manca solo 
la scimmial" My son misses only a monkey, to mean that he owns all the animals 
you can imagine. 
Ferdinando worked on the fishing boats in Ischia since he was six years old. I 
ask if his father had a boat and he says that he does not remeber him. He died 
when Ferdinando was three years old. At those times, they went fishing in the 
African coasts and brought back the fish salted (in salamoia) to the port of 
Civitavecchia, near Rome. There were no piers at those times and the boat had 
to dock directly on the beach. His father fell carrying a heavy barrel of 
salty fish on his shoulder, and hurted himself "in basso," in his lower body. 
He died soon after. He left five children (four boys and one girl). "At those 
times, we used to say: 'Non si lavora, non si mangia,' (If you don't work, you 
don't eat); instead today you don't work and you eat well anyway." He 
expresses his disappointment for people who live off the government. 
Ferdinando's two older brothers continued to go fish on the African coast, 
while his younger brother stayed with his mother. He fished on small, row 
boats. He remembers his mother crying. He says she used to fetch water at the 
public fountain and carry it to other families who lived far from the fountain 
to earn a little money. 
Fishing was completely different in America. The Mediterranean sea is a closed 
sea, there was not enough fish, he says. Here there was abundance of fish and 
they did not work with row boats but with motor boats. 
Libby, his son, interrupts him and says that the boat had the motor but 
fishing was done by hand, the nets were hauled in by hand. It was heavy work. 
Libby got ernia twice. He started to work as a fisherman when he was 13/14 
years old and he worked with his father for 12 years. He quit in 1964. 
Ferdinando tells a story to explain that Libby liked to fish and wanted to 
fish with him since he was a little boy. One day Libby went to the docks and 
hid himself on the boat. Nobody could find him for hours. "Tal albero, tale 
frutto," (literally, "like tree, like fruit;" that is "like father, like 
son,") Ferdinando says. Libby quit fishing because of his ernia, and started 
to work in real estate. For a while he continued to fish but then he decided 
to stop. His father pushed him to quit too. He told him: "You cannot do two 
things. Either the one or the other. Stop being a fisherman and do your job." 
Libby says that real estate in California has been really good for everybody. 
His brother Carmine still works on the Santa Maria, the boat that Ferdinando 
build, with Vince and Jerry Di Leva, another Italian named Elio, and Salvatore 
(called in sicilian Turiddu). 
Ferdinando always fished in American waters. He fished tuna, mackarel, bonito 
(a kind of tuna), and also calamari. Libby says that the Yugoslays go fishing 
for 30, 40 and even 50 days but the Italians fished lacally. I ask Libby why 
so. He says: "I don't know. I think we are lovers and not fighters. We like to 
stay close to the family." 
Ferdinando tells me: "Signuri', I want to tell you another story." He tells me 
that during the depression Mr. Bogdanovich, head of the canneries called his 
brother and himself and told them that he would pay for the fish only if he 
sold it, but that he would not pay if he could not sell it. (Ferdinando speaks

very quickly in sicilian and I have a hard time understanding the point of the 
story he is telling me .) Anyway, they waited to get paid and a few months 
later got 1.600 dollars , which they divided among the 12 men of the crew. That 
was a lot of money for the time. 
Russell asks what will happen to the Santa ,Maria when Carmine retires. Libby 
says: "That 's a good question. We don't know... It's the only boat that is 
owned and operated by the original family. It's very unique ... That boat is 52 
years old but it looks brand new." 
Ferdinando says: "Signuri ', mo vi conto un atra storia " (young lady, now I 
tell you another story ). He tells me that when he has debts he goes crazy. In 
1936, he wanted to build the boat and costed 16 thousand dollars. Ferdinando 
and his brothers needed an extra partner to put together the money. 
Bogdanovich told them not to make the same mistake that Amalfitano had made. 
He advised them to build a bigger boat that they could not afford to pay, a 
boat that would have costed 36 thousand dollars. They built the Santa Maria, 
but Ferdinando says that he almost went crazy because of the big debt he had 
to pay. Libby adds that during world war 2, his father could no longer fish 
because he was not an American citizen. He was put ashore for about 11 months. 
The boat was ready to be sold when finally he got permission to go back 
fishing again. When Ferdinando came from Italy he "jumped the ship." Libby 
explains : "In those days , you came across the Atlantic , you worked your ass 
off and then you arrived to New York and you jumped ship and then head to good 
old California where the fish are at." 
So when in 1934 he wanted his wife to 
come to the States he had to wait for three years to get his immigration 
documents in order before being able to have his wife come. 
His wife came with six small children from Italy on the "Rex." 
They stayed for a couple of days with relatives in New York and then took the 
train to California . Ferdinando went to pick his family up at the station in 
L.A. Libby was six at the"time. 
Ferdinando says of himself that he has been adopted by America. He likes 
America. "There is no other place in the world better than San Pedro," he 
says. Libby adds: "When he (Ferdinando ) came here , you could walk on the fish! 
There was every kind of fish you can think of out there..." 
Side 2 
While Libby talks in English about the different types of fishing Ferdinando 
receives a call from Italy. A relative who wants to wish him a happy birthday. 
(Ken Light leaves) 
Ferdinando learned to mend the nets in Ischia. He remembers he used to "steal" 
the thread that his mother used to knit socks with and practise at home on a 
piece of old net what he had seen the old people do with their nets. 
Still today when his son Carmine breaks one of the nets he calls Ferdinando 
who helps mending it . Libby says that very few people know how to mend the 
nets today . "It's a lost art." 
I ask why the boats don 't have any color or any special decorative patterns on 
them. Ferdinando says: "Excuse me, but these are not yachts , these are fishing 
boats! " Libby adds : "You do what has to be done , why make them more colorful, 
more pretty , you want to be useful ... they don't go for beauty." 
Ferdinando says that three things have changed fishing in a radical way: the 
nylon for the nets, the power block, and the power skip (?). 
Russell asks if he put coins under the mast of the Santa Maria. Ferdinando 
does not remember about it, but Libby says that when his brother Carmine had 
to change the mast and put a new one in he,found a coin underneath. It was for 
good luck. 
Russell asks if they had the boat blessed. Libby replyes: "Are you kidding? Of 
course." Ferdinando remembers the christening of the boat with the bottle of 
champagne but Libby adds that everytime things would go bad they would call 
the priest to bless the boat. I ask who is the patron of fishermen. They say 
San Giovanni Giuseppe and Sant' Antonio. I ask Ferdinando if he is a religious 
man. He says that you cannot live without religion. I ask why did he named the 
boat Santa Maria and he says: " When Colombus came to America, what did he 
have? Didn't he have the Santa Maria!?" All the "meridionali," people from the 
south are attached to their saints, so the boats are often named after the 
saints. 
Ferdinando participates to the celebrations for San Giovanni Giuseppe della 
Croce; he says that if I am in California for the celebration he invites me to 
go to the dinner with him. He has never carried the saint but Libby and his 
brother Carmine have. 
I ask if Ferdinando ever got hurt fishing. Libby tells the story in English 
and Ferdinando interrupts him several times to tell me his version of the 
accident in sicilian. (I have a hard time following). The second time the boat 
went out Ferdinando got knocked out by the power block on the boat. He was 
like dead. He broke his nose and had two sticks up his nose. Today, Libby 
says, everybody would take six months off after such an accident, but 
Ferdinando went out fishing the next night. Ferdinando's job was to be up on 
the higher place on the boat (close nest?) to check the fish. Libby translates 
in English the point that'his father makes in sicilian. In the old days there 
was no kind of electronic equipment at all: when there was fog they used to 
stop the engine and do two things. First they would listen for the fog horn 
and second they would measure the bottom of the ocean with a led line (?), to 
see how deep it was. 
Ferdinando has 25 grandchildren. I ask Libby if he named his children with 
traditional names. Ferdinando answers for him and says that he made a mistake 
because he gave the name Ferdinando to one of his children and Ferdinando does 
not like it. He does not like his own name. Ferdinando never had a nickname, 
but the four brothers were called by other Italians "the Carolina's boys," 
because their mother's name was Carolina. 
Russell asks if Ferdinando misses something from the old coutry here in 
America. Ferdinando says he doesn't miss anything. "I got everything, I got 
everything. I need a longer life, that's it!" 
He was in Ischia two years ago because his second wife has still a big family 
overthere. He says that things are changed but he liked it. He asks me to turn 
off the tape recorder because he wantd to tell us a joke. I say that we want 
to record jokes too, if he agrees. He tells us that when he was in Italy two 
years ago a relative of his wife told him that there was a group of Japanese 
who saw a Neapolitan wearing a nice dress, with a tie and everything. They saw 
him two days in a row and finally asked him: 
'how do you manage in Naples, how 
do you get by?' The neapolitan replied: 'ci arrangiamo,'(we manage, we get

Libby tells us that last year he found his father lifting a heavy wine barrel 
by himself in the garage. He had drilled a hole with a hand drill through the 
rafter, put a slain through the rafter and did the whole thing by himself 
without asking for help. 
Ferdinando is not interested in what his son has to say about him. He calls 
for my attention and expresses his disappointment for the world in which we 
live today. He says he is tired, he doesn't go out anymore, he prefers to stay 
home. "This dope, this cocaine, is infesting the world ... where are we going, 
where will we arrive." 
(I can hear in the background the beginning of our interview with Ferdinando. 
It seems like the content of two different tapes have been copied on the same 
tape.) 
Ferdinando spends his days cleaning around the house, attending the rabbits, 
watching television, and resting a lot. I ask if he sees the family often, and 
he says yes. Everybody calls him, all his children live in San Pedro. (the 
voices from the other interview interfere with this one. It is difficult to 
understand.) 
Ferdinando says he feels he can live to one hundred years. I wish him to live 
to one hundred and ten years. He thanks me and kisses me.

Born April 4, 1924. Dad left Italy 1899 "for opportunity." 
Grandfather came 1870 , homesteaded in Firebaugh, went back to Italy. Dad also 
left to avoid military service. U.S. quota was filled, so he went to Sao 
Paolo, Brazil , where he worked as a cabinet maker 7 years. "Those kind of 
people, maybe they were different than us. They were more dedicated and they 
had, I think , a deeper feeling than we do.,' 
In 1906, dad came to the U.S. to help rebuild San Francisco after the 
earthquake . Dad tells story of leaving his suitcase on the wharf and finding 
it still there. "In Italy, if you just blinked your eye it would be gone." 
Thus America made a good first impression. S.F. was already rebuilt, so he 
moved on to Spokane . The Swedes there didn 't like the Italians. "They push-a 
you down ." Met his wife there , married in 1915. She's from Priest River, 
Idaho. Maternal grandparents came over in 1880s, mom born in 1898. 
Around 1922, his parents returned to California. "In the old country, 
land was very important to them." First bought land in Canada, but couldn't 
sell it since he wasn't a citizen , so he lost $3,000 on it. Bought property in 
San Jose, then came to Gilroy, "met the rest of the Italian colony here," and 
bought 10 acres north of town. 
Dad's fare to Brazil was $40. "I came with the cattle." As the oldest, 
"It was the custom ... to get his brothers and sisters over here. You work, you 
buy a little bit of food and you don't waste money and you save." The rest of 
the family is in Tacoma. One brother became an attorney . Dad intent on buying 
property. 
Depression : Family was fortunate to have the farm. Dad worked steady as 
a cabinetmaker . Dad preached going into business for oneself because "the 
bosses are all crooks ." It "didn't stick" to Al, who went to work as a 
sheriff's deputy. Regrets he didn't stay with farming. The life is tough, he 
says, but very rewarding. "We could've owned a thousand acres and it would've 
been worth a hundred million dollars , but money is not everything in life." 
Dad went to live in Mexico when he was 75. Died at 90. When he came to 
Brazil he didn't want to come via the indenture program. "Talk about guts," 
maternal grandmother came •to U.S. at age 85 and lived to be 99. Description of 
his dad 's life in Guadalajara. 
Al still has all his dad's cabinetmaking tools. Never learned much 
Italian: told to "keep his eyes open , his ears open and his mouth shut." 
Parents mainly associated with other Italians , the second generation 
mixed with other groups more. "In my time it was almost insulting to be 
Italian." He was bothered by being called a Dago. 
[side B] 
Tried to "camouflage " his Italian-ness. There was also a stigma attached 
to being a prune-growing farmer's boy. Al's wife isn 't Italian . Kids quarter 
Italian -- "Italian is gone." But some of the cooking and the philosophy is 
retained . Now it's popular to be Italian and he's not afraid to say his name 
is Gagliardi. 
Today, the Italians , once Gilroy's largest minority , have "melted in," 
and its the Mexicans who are the underdogs now. 
Prune farming: SC Valley used to be largest prune-growing region in the 
world. 
Gagliardis supplemented income with 2,000 chickens . Sold eggs and fryers 
from the house. Mom worked in the cannery summers. The money was in the eggs, 
not in the fryers. Al had to clean the houses, put the manure in the orchard, 
gather the eggs, feed the chickens, wash, weigh and pack the eggs. Started 8-
9-10 years old. Dad made wine for family during bootleg days. 
Dad hired people to pick and prune . Family did the rest. Dad gave him his 
chores for the week, then went off cabinet -making. 
011 ' 
a 
Sunday gatherings: "I would swear there was nothing in the house to eat 
and somehow they would produce a big meal." Grabbed a couple of chickens, 
picked carrots, chard, chicory, fava beans and "come lunchtime we'd have this 
monstrous meal: spaghetti and chicken cacciatore, ravioli." "I ate eggs and 
chickens every way you can think about making em." Was glad to get away from 
chicken in the Army. 
In summers, the family spent Sundays at a beach near Watsonville ("Santa 
Cruz was too fancy for us.") Al and his sister would ask about going to the 
beach and their father would tell them to see how much gas was in the car. 
This was before gas gauges. They'd use a dip stick and try to fool their 
father by putting in the stick on an angle. 
Organizations: Dad belonged to Figli d'Italia. Big picnics with speech-
making. Dad spoke against Mussolini, alienating other members of the 
community. "They wanted to throw my dad in the creek." Was told by his friends 
not to be so outspoken. 
Fiesta della Rosas in San Jose. 
WWII. Dad wanted him to go to college after the war, he felt too old, 
wasn't interested in farming, although "there was a certain amount of loyalty 
I owed my parents." Wound up a Santa Clara County sheriff's deputy, he's not 
sure how or why. Continued running the ranch, until his father went to Mexico, 
then leased it, and finally sold it off. Dad was proud. "In Italian families 
it's the custom of the father to leave the remaining son all the property," 
but Al insisted that his sister get half. 
Dad wanted to buy property, mother was thinking of kids' shoes and food 
and clothes. He'd buy a piece of property and she would sell it. If she 
hadn't, according to his dad, Al would have had a hefty inheritance. Dad would 
say San Jose and Gilroy would grow together and become one city. 
Sheriff's dept.: 60 deputies when Al started. "Very small, we knew 
everybody."

[tape 2 of 2] 
His career as a sheriff's deputy. "Serving the public, but it was also a 
dirty job." Retired at age 52 as field commander of south county sub-station. 
"I didn't know everybody , but you sort of feel that way." It helped that he 
was Italian when on a call involving an Italian family.  "Gagliardi . Come in, 
have a glass of wine.'', 
Since retiring , he does a lot of gardening , woodwork (" I guess it's a 
trait from my dad" ), golfing, fishing . Keeps a garden at Michael Bonfante's 
(Nob Hill Foods ) Tree Haven on Hecker Pass. 
Has a daughter raising kids in 
Va. and another working as a dental hygienist in San Jose . Holiday meals are a 
combination of Italian and American food. Zucchini and green beans cooked 
Italian style. 
Prunes: Most growers grew French prunes (as opposed to Italian or 
Imperial prunes). "A prune is a plum with sufficient amount of sugar to allow 
dehydration without fermentation " He has prunes drying in the backyard. 
Prunes dipped in lye, spread out in trays to sun-dry. Drying took a week to 10 
days. Dehydrators came in during the late thirties . "We always thought the 
sun-dried ones were the best." 
Mother made prune cake, prune cookies, stuffed prunes (with walnuts or 
almonds and powdered sugar ) for Christmas . Describes Calabresi cookies called 
"scalida." 
[side B] 
Differences between Calabrese and Piemontese foods and dialects. Had 
spaghetti-manufacturing relatives in Portland , to whom, at Christmas, they 
shipped prunes and from whom, they received spaghetti. 
"We lose our identity of Italian ; we become mixed up in this melting pot 
and become one people ." Some people we interview are going to be "Italian 
Italian," he says, Val Filice, for one. "If you didn't know you'd think he 
came from Italy." Val's brother Ernie, on the other hand, not married to an 
Italian as Val is, is more like Al. 
Al's mother and brother are buried in the Catholic cemetery in Gilroy. 
One brother killed in the'war, the other in a car wreck. 
TIAW-RF-A021= 
Maternal grandfather first to come to U.S. c. 1908, settled 
in San Jose. Father knew people who ran Costa Hotel in S.J. He came in 1906. 
Both parents from same Piemonte town, though they only met here, marrying in 
SJ in 1909. Raised vegetables and delivered them in SJ by horse and buggy; 
also raised vegetables in Gustine, Tehama and Salinas, landing in Gilroy 
around 1924. Had grape orchard, bought his own 17-acre ranch around 1928. 
Dad borrowed money to come over, knew no English; mom came with brother 
and sister. Parents met at a dance. Italians fixed up the old Live Oak School 
and had Piemonte Club picnics and dances there. 
Aldo helped with the pruning and grafting as a kid, helped with the 
wine-making for family consumption, sold the rest of the grapes to the 
wineries. Drank half a glass of wine and water mixed as a kid. Raised chickens 
and rabbits, vegetable garden. "Had to. You couldn't afford to buy 'em." 
Thanksgiving was at their house, Christmas and Easter at other 
relatives' in San Jose. Women in the kitchen all day, men played bocce. Dad 
played every Sunday, cards if it was raining. Played a game with Tarot cards, 
"tarocchi." Or Pedro. 
Family first lived at what is now the Thomas Kruse Winery; father took 
care of the vineyards. Garlic growing didn't come in until the fifties. Before 
that it was all grapes and prunes. Dad borrowed money to buy his ranch, vines 
already there, planted prunes and apricots. The valley was all white blossoms 
in the spring. 
The old families: Filice, Parelli, Porcella. 
Aldo went to work at the post office and took care of the ranch in the 
afternoon and on weekends, finally leased it to someone else. His brother 
became a strawberry grower, on leased land. 
(side B] 
The orchard business: pickers hired for the prunes. No celebrations 
after harvest, "just went home and collapsed. We were just glad it was over." 
He thinks Europeans get more out of life. Here we work too hard. 
Now that he's retired, Aldo works for Veterans of Foreign Wars. Doesn't 
belong to any Italian-American organizations. 
Parents learned English by helping kids with their homework. He still 
speaks a little, so does his son, who's getting a master's in statistics at 
Hayward State and working at Gilroy Foods for the summer. Aldo took an Italian 
class at Gavilan College before visiting Italy. About 7 people in the class. 
Biggest wave of Italian immigration was in the 1910s and 1920s. 
How the garlic festival got started. 
Father was Giuseppe, mother, Giuseppina. Naming traditions. 
Their trip to Italy: Italian life quieter, not so hectic. 
"I still like my Italian heritage. I still like to keep that, even 
though I'm over here." Family hard-working and patriotic. Father remembered 
how poor they were when he left Italy, how they ate polenta all the time. 
Other northern specialties were bania calda (garlic sauce), biscotti. 
Holidays: turkey for Thanksgiving, fried cream for Christmas dessert. No

Born February 16, 1938 in Cosenza, Calabria, Italia. Father 
born in U.S. 1905. Grandfather worked in mines in Pittsburgh, Kansas. Was 
trapped in mine three days, vowed if he got out alive he would take his 
family back to Italy. Bought farm in Cosenza and made wine. Father lost U.S. 
citizenship by serving in Italian army. In 1959, he regained his citizenship 
and came back to the U.S. 
Mario worked 15 years for local wineries. Bought vineyards in 1970, 
started winery in 1972. Worked 13 years for San Martin and two years for 
Almaden. "We still believe that the old tradition of wine making is best." 
Impossible to produce natural wine in giant quantities. Thus, he prefers to 
stay small. Stomped grapes by foot in Italy until 1950s. Still uses basket 
press, ferments and ages in wood. 
More on staying small: no need for filtration and clarification. "Just 
like you cook two pounds of spaghetti or a hundred pounds of spaghetti. They 
cannot come out the same."

San Martin Winery had 50 employees, million gallon capacity in 1960. 
Operated forklift, machines, ran vinegar plant, in charge of shipping, 
receiving and inventory in order to become fam-Jliar with all facets of the 
business. The Filices, who ran San Martin, were from Donnici, a little town 
near Cosenza. His mother's a Filice. 
Has 15 acres of grapes. Was "born making wine." Pride in carrying on 
family tradition -- and in receiving awards'. 
Was 21 when he came from Italy, met his wife in 1962. Her mother's from 
Cosenza; her father's from Spain. She was born in Gilroy. Wife never worked 
outside the family. 
Put up winery building in 1972, got license in 1973. Hired carpenters 
to do framing work, contracted to lay foundation, but finished walls, 
roofing, electrical work himself. Sons work as mechanic, plumber and 
salesman, and work part-time at the winery. The winery can't support all 
four families without tripling production. Would have to grow more grapes 
and land is too expensive now -- $20-30,000 /acre. Was between $3-5,000 /acre 
in 1970. Since Mario's not ready to retire, little thought has been given 
to which, if any of his sons would take over. 
Santa Clara Valley has the oldest wine industry in California. Today 
there are 17 wineries in the area, which brings in tourists, which insures 
that the little wineries will survive. And everyone has high hopes that 
Bonfante's Family Adventure Park will be a big draw. Small wineries impart 
"a personal feeling, a family feeling to the product. It's the pride going 
into the product ... We no make a wine to make an extra dollar. We forget to 
make a dollar but we have pride to turn out a good wine." 
Origin of name Hecker Pass Winery: after the highway, which is named 
after a county supervisor. The problem with using the family name is that 
if the winery changes hands and the next owner runs it into the ground, it 
can ruin the family name.

Began with two redwood tanks and 50 oak barrels. Broke his leg building 
the roof the first year. First crush 1973. Bottled 1974. Won awards for all 
four wines at Los Angeles Co. Fair the first y?ar. Redwood tank maker in San 
Leandro (Brown, three generations). More on the downside of clarifying and 
filtering: takes away the full-bodied flavor. "We know what we want to drink 
here for ourselves so that's what we want to make for the public, too." 
He prefers dry, full-bodied reds. A glass or two with every meal is 
healthful. No need to feel you have to finish a bottle once you've opened.

The crush: best to pick in the day and crush 'em at night. Otherwise the 
stems impart bitterness to the juice. Skins give flavor and color to wine. 
Never ferment down to zero sugar or it'll take 20 years for it to be 
drinkable. Look for good balance of color, flavor, something you can drink 
in two or three years, or age for 20 years. He lets it finish fermenting in 
storage tank. 
Best to pick by hand. When berry breaks, fermentation begins. Big 
wineries kill their yeast in the field, then add it after the crush. Harvest 
done by family and friends: takes two weeks to harvest the 15 acres. One-ton 
tubs on top of trailer. Hooked knives used. Sugar's at 20 now, he's 
waiting for it to get to 24 or 25. Prefers to pick on weekday because 
tasting room business is heaviest on weekend. But his volunteer pickers work 
during the week, so it's tough. 
Big dinner at day's end? No, everyone's too tired. But after harvest he 
hosts a dinner. Lunch is cold cuts, tomatoes, boiled potatoes, olive oil, 
onion salad. The dinner is lasagna or barbecue. He lives in a mobile home 
next to the winery. P

No irrigation. They get less grapes, but better wine. Unirrigated roots 
grow deeper. 
After crush, half-inch left open in storage tank for three-four weeks. 
Then sediment taken out, topped off, aged two-three years. Topping is done 
every month. Leftover wine is used for topping of the barrels. Following 
April, sediment taken out again, then resume monthly topping off. 
Description of how sediment is removed. 
Bottling. Timing varies. Depends on storage, demand. Whit has to be 
year, year-and-half old. Reds, three to five years. Young wines drunk in 
Italy, but not here. Americans want their wines to be "smoother, more 
drinkable." 
Shifting tastes: from red to wine and back to red again. Tasting room 
boom has helped in the marketing of wine. His opened in 1974. 90 percent of 
wine is sold out of tasting room (including shipments to people who first 
tried it at tasting room), the other 10 percent in local restaurants. 
How sugar content is sampled. 
He's secure in his knowledge that the wine will be good, year after 
year. The problem of rain during or just before harvest.

Uncertainties of farming . Mario gets to relax a little after 
the harvest , but there 's still work to be done removing sediment , toppin\ -
readying for holidays , running the tasting room. 
Language: importance of learning lang. in adopted country. He speaks 
little Italian to family because he needs the practice in English. But he 
thinks he should speak Italian with his grandchildren so they can learn. Rids 
are proud to be Italian . Family still has house , winery and grapes in Italy

Dates of birth: Mario-11/20/29; Ines (Valbusa)-7/12/30; 
Maria-3/29/09. Family from Coconatto, near Torino, where they had a ranch, 
where they grew grapes, wheat, corn. Maria was 19 when she came to the U.S. 
with her husband. He came first, then brought her back with him. He was a 
nurseryman. They lived in S.F. five years, then moved to Gilroy in 1933. Mario 
was born in S.F. They rented a ranch in Gilroy and grew prunes and apricots on 
55 acres. Father was partners with Maria's sister's husband. Bought their 
Thomas Rd. ranch in 1943. Before that, the family lived in town, not on the 
ranch. 
Mario: "Gilroy really didn't have an Italian neighborhood. There were a 
lot of Italians. But it wasn't exclusively Italians." There were many from 
Coconatto. "In those days, the Italian community stuck together. Picnics, 
dinners. The families would all gather together..." Maria remembers Saturday 
night dances with the Pappanis and the Conrottos, Piemontesi, all. 
Foods: chicken, ravioli. So much food, everyone would come back the next 
day to finish it off. Maria: "Old people, young people, they all mixed." 
Differences between Piemontesi and Calabresi: dialect, food. Maria claims 
Piemontesi are the better cooks. Most families made wine and had a cellar. 
"They were all good winemakers," according to Mario. Maria always made pasta 
and bread. Oberti used to peddle olive oil door to door. Italian groceries: 
The New Gilroy Bakery and Rossi's Store. 
Holiday customs: Calabresi do the door-to-door "mumming," on Epiphany, 
bake special Christmas cookies, are more tenacious of their traditions 
generally. 
Language: Both Ines and Mario grew up speaking Italian. Their sons know 
a few phrases only. Ines took a course at the college and picked up enough to 
send cards to family in Italy. Mario and his mother switch back and forth 
between English and Italian. 
Maria worked in the cannery -- along with the other Italian women. 
Apricots, tomatoes, spinach, fruit cocktail, pears. Wages and hours, 6 days a 
week, sometimes 7. Going home for lunch. Mario, 10, had to heat lunch and do 
the dishes. She worked there 4 years -- until they bought the ranch. 
(side B] 
The cannery was the major employer in the town. A truck would pick up 
all the employees. Maria made $20/week. The work consisted of sorting and 
coring. Her husband worked their one day. They had him stomping hot peppers. 
By noon, the heat of them was unbearable. He left at noon and never went back. 
The ranch on Thomas Rd.: 40 acres, all prunes. Today it's mostly seed 
crops: flowers, beans, cauliflower, peppers. Dad died in 1967. Began pulling 
the prunes in 1968. In 1972-3, he pulled the rest. Orchards got old, 
production down, prices down. Calabresi did more with stuffing prunes and figs 
than they did. Cookies made for Lent, boiled chestnuts. 
The ranch was about a mile from town; now it's right in town. He gets 
offers for the property, but his sons are taking over the farming. Mario began 
helping his father at age 8. Prunes would dry on the hot gravel of the dry 
creekbed. People were hired to pick. One or two guys helped with the drying. 
"I started to take the place of a man ... when I was 12 years old." Dipping 
prunes. "Nowadays if we did that they'd throw the parents in jail." 
Summers, after the prunes were picked they'd go to the beach, picnicking 
and crawfishing on a creek in Santa Cruz. 
Cooked the crawdads over a fire 
along with polenta. Polenta was "poor man's food." Roasted polenta served for 
breakfast. Cheese-salami-polenta casseroles. Every first meeting in Jan. they 
work on a polenta dinner for the Italian Catholic Federation. Ines: "Of 
course, I make it in the microwave now." 
Dipping the prunes: Boiling water and lye to cut the skin of the prune, 
cuasing moisture to evaporate quicker, preventing fermentation and rot. Prunes 
would take 5-6 days to dry. Late in the season there were problems of wet 
weather causing the prunes to crack or get wormy. Sometimes they had to be 
redipped. Built a dehydrator in 1947, which took 10-12 hours to dry the 
prunes. The large ones would get run through twice, first at low temperatures, 
then again at a higher temp. Ran on butane, then natural gas.

Despite this loving description, Maria says she doesn't miss the old 
country, in part because the old country is here in the form of her sister and 
her other fellow townspeople. 
The voyage to America: lifelong friends made. Ines' father booked 
passage for her mother before he asked her to marry him. 
Harvest: Has been at it three or four months, beginning with broccoli. 
Two months to go. Major crop was pickling cucumbers, with sharecroppers. State 
sued the cuke growers for this system, which enabled growers not to have to 
pay benefits, social security, workman's comp. State supreme court ruled 
against growers and put them out of business. Mario said it was profitable for 
both the growers and the sharecroppers. Also grows cauliflowers, watermelons, 
canteloupes, poppies, geraniums on 40 acres at home and another 110 acres 
leased. 25 different crops all told.

Born 12/16/09. Parents from province of Asti, they came 
separately and met in San Francisco. Dad was working in wineries, mom as a 
housekeeper. Decided SF was "too big of a city to raise a son," so they moved 
to Santa Clara, where his father worked in a lumber mill, then in 1920, the 
bought a vineyard and winery in Gilroy. Father came to U.S. before 1906. 
Grandfather was a farmer, had a vineyard. John was born in S.F. First they 
leased a vineyard in Gilroy for three years, then bought the ranch he still 
lives on in 1923. "There was nothing, it was a dirt field." 
Planting the vineyard: bought St. George roots, which are still 
producing on 20 acres. Sold grapes to Italian families in Santa Clara and San 
Francisco, delivered and crushed. Quit 5-6 years ago. "At that time, every 
Italian family made their wine." Delivered from half to two tons. Ton makes 
150 gallons. John still makes wine for his own use. Most of the work they did 
themselves, except for pruning. 
John was 11 when they moved to Gilroy. No brothers or sisters. His mom 
did the sulfuring in early spring and again three or four more times. Prevents 
mildew. No irrigation. 
In late 20s, "practically every Italian family would throw a party" and 
there'd be 50 to 200 guests. Two days to finish the leftovers. Italian music, 
dancing. Ate "the best of everything." 
Raised chickens, rabbits, a vegetable garden. When they first moved to 
Gilroy they didn't have a car and didn't get to town more than once a week. 
Social world consisted of 10-12 isolated ranches. In Gilroy, east side near 
the cannery were mostly Calabresi; the west side was northerners. 
Grew up speaking Italian. So did his daughters. But his daughters' kids 
don't speak it. 
(She married a non-Italian.) John's wife is Spanish. 
For the first 10-15 years of his working life, he ran a ranch for 
absentee owners. Moved back to his father's place in 1950. Today, he takes 
care of his garden and leases the vineyards to Ernie Fortino. Near the end, he 
was still selling the grapes off the ranch, but no longer delivering. He also 
stopped growing the grapes and bought them all from growers. "As the oldtimers 
were passing away, the young people quit making wine." Then, "when the boys 
came home from the war," interest in winemaking revived. Today, the demand is 
greater than ever. 
John's planning to make about 150 gallons of white wine soon. Shooting 
for 26-27 sugar to make a sweeter wine. 
(demonstration of sacrometer] 
Also on the place: "family orchard" -- prunes, peaches, apricots. 
Surplus canned. 
The first car was John's 1927 Model T. 
Italian orgs.: Sons of Italy and Italian Catholic Federation. ICF 
started in San Francisco. Today there are more than 300. Gilroy branch (number 
28) formed more than 50 years ago by Roffinella. To make sure people came, 
they had a dinner at every meeting, usually representing a different regional 
cuisine. 
(side B] 
ICF donations to scholarships. Annual picnic, bake sale. 
"People don't visit as much as they used to...Now you don't even know 
who your neighbors are." Still goes to ICF meetings. 
John's been to Italy seven times. Most families now live in town, but 
still have their little vineyard in the hills. 
Parents took the boat to NY, train to SF. Had a friend already in SF and 
working at a winery when he came. Mother worked at home making dresses. 
John worked in the cannery for two years in the early 30s. Drove the bus 
that picked up "the canning girls." 
Ranches succumbing to the subdividers. Farming grapes or anything else 
no longer profitable in SC Valley. "Now if you find a prune you have to plant 
your own." He thought he'd never plant a prune tree, because of how little he 
liked the work, but two years ago, he planted two trees. 
His collection of antique farm equipment. 
He and Pete Scagliotti are the last two oldtimers on Hecker Pass 
Highway. ICF meetings used to conducted in Italian, now all in English. Was 
also in Piemonte Club. Piemontese specialty: Bana calda (garlic, olive oil and 
anchovies, for dipping raw vegetables) Popular on New Year's. 
Cans and cures his own olives. Mother baked bread. 
Month-by-month. Nov-Dec-Jan: pruning. Then tie up vines to stakes. Feb-
March: start sulfuring to prevent mildew. April-May: suckering (break off 
surplus shoots). Sulfur periodically, then wait for crop to ripen. Used to do 
all the pruning himself in a month's time. 
Miller Ave. was old Gilroy city limits. 
John was part of group that founded Gavilan Bank. 
TIAW-RF-A027= 
Born Nov. 23, 1912. Parents born near Torino in the north in 
1878. Father farmed, mother was a dressmaker. "They just made a living with 
their cow and their little piece of land." Dad came to U.S. in 1905, intending 
to pick the money that grew on trees, then go back. Instead, after a year he 
sent for his wife and she was so sick on the boat that she decided she would 
never go back. 
Dad was working at the mine in Bingham Canyon, Utah at the time. Had 
friends already there, who then moved to California. After six years, dad left 
Bingham for California. Worked in the salt plant in Redwood City while looking 
for property in Santa Clara Valley. Jennie and her brother were born in 
Bingham Canyon. Dad bought property in San Martin in 1918, built house the 
next year, lived there until he died in 1953. Raised grapes and prunes on 75 
acres. 
Her brother (Louie's father) sold grapes to Italian families on the 
peninsula and to local wineries. He had a crusher on the truck. "In those 
days, most of the Italian people had cellars." 
Party for workers after the prune harvest. As prune trees got bigger, 
they bore more than the family could harvest themselves and workers would have 
to be hired. The kids helped pick, dip and dry. Dehydrators: prunes put on 
trays and dried for 15-20 hours. Prunes stuffed with walnuts and dipped in 
chocolate and given as gifts. 
Spoke mostly Italian at home. Her husband is Portuguese, so in her own 
household, the language was English and the children didn't learn Italian. 
Went to college for a year, worked as a stenographer-bookkeeper for a 
year before getting married. 
Transition to row crops in the 1970s. They got out of prune business in 
1975 and out of grapes in 1983. 
(echo ends] 
She and her husband grew only prunes on their 150 acres. Now he's 
retired and most of the land has been sold off. Her brother's two sons went 
into row crop farming, then one went into construction while Louie stayed with 
it. Lou's ranch used to be a pear orchard. 
Her brother, Tony, struck out on his own in 1935. "Italian families, you 
know, they work together and they buy property and put it in their children's 
name." 
Jennie cooks Italian food sometimes, but having married a Portuguese-
American, "I went more the American way...I still like to think I'm Italian. I 
like the Italian heritage and I like the Italian food ... After I got married I 
just changed over to the American way of doing things, I forgot about the 
Italian or ignored the Italian traditions." 
Dad had always hoped to return to Italy. Finally did in 1932 with Jennie 
(her mom stayed stateside). "I was really looked at as though I was a 
princess. I was very impressed with the way the people really respected the 
Americans." Went back with her husband in 1983. "The respect wasn't quite the 
same." In 1932, at least, she preferred the "luxuries" of life in the U.S. 
Visiting, which took place on the weekends, is now just on special 
occasions, such as Christmas or on birthdays. In her childhood she remembers 
basement dances to Italian accordion music. Knew George Porcella, the 
bandleader. 
Her garden: corn, tomatoes, bell peppers, eggplant, zucchini. "I've done 
a lot of canning in my day ... peaches, cherries, pears, plums, prunes. And 
used to do a lot of jams and jellies." Mother used to 
aker her own pasta. 
Italian people believed that outdoor ovens made better bread. 
(side bJ 
Food: Gathering wild mushrooms in the spring. Were dried and lasted all 
year for sauces. 
The "Italian Way": Italians closer to their children, more respectful of 
family ties. Her son works for Hewlett-Packard. Daughter, a former 
schoolteacher, works for the Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose. Wanted 
son to take over farm, but he had allergy problems. 
"It hurt to see" when they knocked down their prune trees. She says the 
reason was old age. Her husband says they weren't generating enough income. 
The trees bore, but the price was down. They switched to sugar beets and 
peppers, selling to Del Monte. 
In high school, she worked at Filice and Perelli Cannery in Gilroy. 
Summer job. Piecework. Half the cannery, people prepared the fruit; from there 
to the canning dept. for washing and canning. Paid by the can. Wore rubber 
aprons. Didn't talk much. All nationalities, a lot of Italians. 
Delivery of grapes to home winemakers stopped around 1955. 
(echo's back) 
Photos: They have pictures of the family, but not of the work around the 
farm. Grew up around both northern and southern Italians. The two groups had 
different sauces and different pastries. 
"One thing about the Italians, they like to sing..There's always 
somebody that's a good singer and the others sort of follow them." 
Went to church in Morgan Hill. Church didn't play much of a social 
role. 
T IAW-RF-A028= 
Dad born 1881 in Baceno, Italy near Swiss border. Came to SF 
in 1902. Married 1909. One of 10 children. From SF he went to Pescadero to 
work in lumber mill, but there was a strike on, so he found work on a dairy, 
though he never milked a cow in his life. Became a cheesemaker. Next worked at 
a Hollister dairy. Salary included drop calves. Bought out the dairy, started 
his own, relocated to Frazier Lake Rd. in Gilroy. Bought present ranch in 
1916. Bought 30 acres, built house and barns, added 10 acres, then bought 
another 40 acres in 1928, which he planted in alfalfa, then added 50 acres, 
then 14 more in 1936. The brothers took over in 1940. Their father retired in 
1950. A hard worker, never took a vacation. A big, strong man. "His pleasure 
in life was work ... He was so busy taking care of the ranch he didn't have too 
much time for his children... But we respected him. He was stern, but he was 
fair." 
Most of the dairymen were Italian and Portuguese. 
Mother's side of the family (Ramezana): names, dates of birth. From near 
Genoa. Came to US in 1902. Involved in a seed company in Hollister. 
John and Henry born in Gilroy. Mother was in charge of the garden. In 
1922, their dad began growing tomatoes. In 1928, they had tomatoes (Santa 
Clara canning variety -- "a big, rough tomato") and harvested 38 tons to the 
acre, an unusually high yield. No pesticides, most of the farming done with 
horses until 1932 when they bought their first tractor. Dad would mow and rake 
while the kids milked the cows. Started growing sugar beets in 1935. Grew 
garlic in 1934, but lost money on it and never grew it again. The brothers 
planted, garlic, sugar beets, tomatoes, corn, prunes, pears, cucumbers, 
lettuce. Got out of dairy in 1950. 
Food: Two or three hogs every year, mainly for lard, but made sausages, 
hams, bacon, salt pork. Preserved pepper, onion, beans in salt brine. 
Chickens. Butchered some of the veal. "Depression years were no problem for 
us." Mother cooked and baked on wood stove. Brothers took down a couple of 
oaks every year for wood. The house they grew up in is being remodeled, the 
barns are still in good shape, but the tank house is in ruins. 
Language: Dda spoke Swiss, mom spoke Piemontese. They didn't understand 
each other, so they spoke English and the boys never learned Italian. 
Social life: "Social life was work." Only visiting was Sunday afternoons 
with one neighboring family for an hour or two of wine-drinking. Dad made 
wine. Couldn't get workers without it. Mother cooked for the workers, who were 
Swiss and Italian. Made vinegar from the "mother," the jellyfish-like sediment 
in the barrels. Bought a ton of grapes, crushed it, put it in fermenting tank, 
uit would foam up, "the more gnats, the better the wine." Big day when wine 
was drawn from fermenting tank into barrels. A day of anticipation, as was the 
day when hog was butchered. Neighbors would come and be served the new wine. 
(side B] 
Food: ravioli, soup, cheese. Breakfast was hash and hotcakes (after 
milking, cleaning barn, washing utensils and before school -- "We needed a 
good breakfast.") Dad was a big man and he ate a lot -- two bowls of soup and 
"he liked his cheese." Mom made bread, roasted a lot of chickens. Big dinners 
Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving. Christmas presents were mostly food and 
clothing. 
Story: Mom "worked out in the fields just like a man." Three kids on 
back of haywagon began saying "Get up" to horses, horses ran off, but she was 
able to pull all three kids off the back. Brothers began milking at ages 7 and 
8. Fed chickens, rabbits, cows, cleaned barn, washed and sterlizied utensils. 
Loose hay put in barn with Jackson fork. (Explanation of how Jackson fork 
works.) Hay salted for curing. 
Working on farm during Depression years made them stronger. Banker tried 
to get their father to mortgage ranch and buy stock before the crash. Father 
wouldn't do it. "He wanted the land. He kept it and he worked it." He had $20 
in his pocket when he landed in SF. Brothers regret not asking more questions 
about Ellis Island. 
Dad had never milked a cow in his life before coming to US. Oldtimers 
milked with their thumb, "Swiss-style." Got milking machines in 1948, quit 
dairying in 1950. 
Older brother worked for postoffice, sister became nurse. The two 
younger brothers stayed on the farm, built their own houses. Satisfied with 
life in Gilroy: "There's really no better place." John's son is a college 
teacher. Henry's son's in export marketing but also farms 250 acres of pepper, 
beets, beans, onions with a partner "to get away from his desk." Brothers 
retired in 1980. Since retirement, "we've been gardening." Fishing, bowling, 
traveling. Wives, raised on ranches also, didn't work near as hard as the 
boys' mother. 
Difficulty of getting started farming nowadays. High cost of equipment 
like tomato picker, which sits idle most of the year. Competition from foreign 
imports. Parents wanted to keep family together because they had left their 
own families back in Italy. Father studied at home for citizenship exam. 
No anti-Italian agitation during WWII. Mafia stereotype never affected 
northerners the way it did southerners. Bootlegging during Depression. Dad was 
approached about putting still in barn, but being a foreigner, "he was afraid 
of the law."

"You know the Italians can't eat without bread" -- Madeline 
Guglielmo. 
Northerners' blaisons populaires about Sicilians: "I never saw one with 
shoes on." Mafia association. George's sister married a Sicilian, over the 
objections of Emilio. They eloped. "But he.was the best guy there ever was." 
Thomas Kruse's praise for John Roffinella for living simply though he 
has lots of money. 
Americanized pronunciations of Italian names. Italian kids were ashamed 
to speak Italian around their peers. 
Prohibition: "The Italians had to have their wine." Emilio continued 
deliveries. Once, he took a wrong turn and wound up at San Quentin. Luckily, 
they didn't check the back of his car or they'd have found cans of wine. 
Emilio mined coal in Oklahoma in early 1900s, drove wagons for a tannery 
and worked for a French winery before starting his own winery. He intended to 
make money in the U.S. and go back to Italy. 
Stories about George's godmother, who lives in Lodi, came to the US by 
herself at age 16. 
Madeline: "Italians over there have misconception about what Italians 
over here had to go through to get to where they are. They think that 
everything was so easy ... We had to work for all we got -- all of us."

In Italy, family farms now being used as summer homes by city dwellers.

Toast to Tom for cooking. 
Piemontese cooking: rabbit stew, bania calda. 
On the loudness of Italians. 
Description of Emilio (a big, hard-working man). George describes 
delivery route between Morgan Hill and San Francisco. Warehouse in Daly City. 
Minimum delivery was five cases per family. When they were finished they would 
get hero sandwiches at a North Beach deli, crab at fisherman's wharf and eat 
them with a half-gallon of wine at Aquatic Park, then drive home to Morgan 
Hill. Wine bottled mostly in gallon jugs and demi-johns. 
Living at the winery there was no rest and no privacy. George and 
Madeline lived in the tank house when they were first married. 
Piemontese songs. Music and singing at Mountain View chapter of Sons of 
Italy barbecue at winery recently reminded family of Emilio's Labor Day 
parties. 
Grappa. 
No harvest celebration. Mexicans always picked the grapes. 
George helped "as far back as I can remember."

Growth of winery. George: "These kids started taking orders 
when they were out of diapers." The brothers have expanded but the younger 
George regrets the slower, more social pace of earlier days. Customers were 
friends. Buying and selling involved a lot of visiting. 
Younger George followed in his father's footsteps making deliveries to 
families. Rising costs, customer complaints about price increases. George Sr.: 
"Italian people in them days drank wine whether it was hot or it was cold, 
with their lunch or with their supper." People don't buy wine the same way 
today. They drink less and are likelier to go to the store and buy a bottle or 
two at at time. They still do a few home deliveries even now. 
Changes George made when he took over from Emilio. Varietals introduced. 
George Jr. and Gene have made more extensive changes. 
The Casa Winery -- where the Fortinos are now. 
In 1949 the Guglielmos added 25 acres for $25,000 -- and worried about 
paying it off. When Geo. was in the service, Emilio had opportunity to sell 
the winery and wanted to know if Geo. wanted to carry it on: "What else did I 
know? ... When I come home I started to get behind the wheel of the truck...I 
was the only son. What am I gonna do, cut him flat after all the years he 
spent?" 
George Jr. more of a throwback to Emilio, with whom he spent a lot of 
time as a boy. The Guglielmos uniqueness as a family business. Transitions in 
type of customer (from five-case to single bottle) new types of wine. 
George talks about how his three sons got involved in the business. 
"What you see now," says Gene, "is the culmination of a lot of hard work -- my 
grandparents, my parents and now our generation." 
Gene talks about hi' 
change of thinking from wanting to strike out on 
his own, to going to the old country and seeing where his granparents come 
from, which made him think about what it would be like to drive by the winery 
and see a shopping center or a subdivision in its place. 
The house was wood before it was stuccoed, basement dug out by pick and 
shovel. 
"The Guglielmos," says Tom Kruse, "are the nicest folks in the whole 
south county." Talks about how much the GG boys help the other local 
winemakers. "All the neighbors have to help each other," says Madeline. 
"Friendly competition," says Gene. 
Guglielmo a bigger than small, smaller than medium-sized winery. One of 
top 100 in U.S. Gene talks about marketing, which he does with Gary while 
George makes the wine. "That's one thing I got to say about George," says 
George Sr., "he's a good winemaker." 
(side B] 
Emilio died in 1961. Gene remembers him as a hard worker, authoritarian. 
"My dad was stern with us, but you know that came from love, not from any mean 
trait in him." Granddad was the same way. Customers told him "he knew when to 
work and he knew when to play...a straight shooter" who never took advantage

of anybody. Not a lot of emotion expressed in their family. Madeline: "But 
your grandmother spoiled you always." Gene: "Grandparents are suposed to spoil 
their grandchildren." 
Language: Madeline's parents came to the states so young that she never 
learned to speak Italian. She understands it, though. Describes her father as 
a hard-working farmer. Their farm was right "across the way" from the 
Guglielmo Winery. Her dad came with flowers on the horses for the christening 
of the winery -- bottle of wine smashed against side of building, accordion 
music, dancing. Guglielmo and Conrotto only wineries in the area still owned 
by original families. Christening? "Italians don't need too much of an excuse 
to have a party," says Gene. 
Did Emilio hunt or fish? "No," says George, "not in those days." 
Madeline: "Their leisure time was Sunday with their company." Cardplaying, 
music, dancing, dinner. Worked weekends. When you call yourself a family 
business, you want to have a family member there to serve the customers in the 
tasting room. 
Church-going: Not much. Too far away, not like in European villages 
where you could walk to church. 
George and Madeline's wedding: in restaurant in San Jose. Changes in SJ: 
from orchards to subdivisions. Paola asks about dowry (no), trousseau (yes. 
Madeline calls it a hope chest.) Madeline's mother 84, lives in retirement 
home in Tracy. Both her grandparents lived into their 90s. 
George Washington Guglielmo: George born Feb. 22 (in San Francisco). 
Tank house: on the property when Emilio bought it. Made into living 
quarters, expanded. (We're eating lunch in the tank house.) 
Family lived near Daly City in SF before making the move to SF. Still 
have warehouse there. 
Madeline sad the Italians didn't teach their kids Italian the way the 
French in San Francisco did. The problem of dialects. Tuscan "the true 
Italian," according to George. Family was from so close to French border that 
their dialect was a sort of French-Italian.
