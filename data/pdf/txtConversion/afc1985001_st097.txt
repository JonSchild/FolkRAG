ST. FRANCIS BOTTOM
Agnes Cunningham
'Way Down in Old St. Francis Bottom Where they call it the Devil's Den Many a poor
tenant has lost his home, And me, Oh God, I'm one.
About the twentieth of January When God sent a great big flood, It run the planters from
their beautiful homes And now they live in tents.
(M. V.'s record ends here)
The planter said to the tenant one day: “Oh boy, how do you like this?” “Boss, it ain't a-
hurtin' me“, The tenant answered him.
“If you would live in some refugee camp Or in some tenant's shack, You'd learn not to be
afeared of cold, Or fear the shinin' sun…
Oh boss, don't you see where you done wrong When you run me outa my shack? I had to
build me a home Out of my ole pick sack.”
