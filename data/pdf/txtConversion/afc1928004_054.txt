SONG OF THE PHILADELPHIA FIRE 
DEPARTMENT IN 1808. 
WRITTEN BY II. ANGELO. 
Air—" Captain with the Whiskers.' 
To the Mill' fire boys I 
dedicate my lay, 
So give me your attention to what I 
have to say, 
I 
venture now to sing of the whole department 
through, 
The Philadelphia Firemen, a 
band both brave and 
true. 
They've engines, hand and steam, and carriages for 
hose, 
With trucks to carry ladders on, as you may well 
suppose, 
As they're alike in name, now more than one, you 
• know, 
For both I 
make one serve, of course, as through 
my list I 
go. 
When the bell to duty calls, up spring these strong 
arni'd men, 
From " Weecacoe" or " Southwark," " Moya-
mensing " and " South Penn ;" 
From " Kensington," " Spring Garden," " North-
ern Liberty" and more, 
From " Mantua," " West Philadelphii and old 
" 
Kingsess' " they pour. 
10 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
With " Mount Airy," " Manayunk," " Wissa-
hick' " and " Germantown," 
Come the " Western" and " Tivoli" boys to put 
the fire down ; 
While the waters from our " Fairmount," with a 
great " Niagara " bound, 
Rise, " Plnenix" like, above us, as sure's the 
" 
Globe " is ' round. 
" " Pennsylvania," by the great 
" 
United States," 
From the " Delaware" to the " Schuylkill," her 
" 
Fame " commemorates ; 
For her firemen are " Vigilant," " Diligent," 
" 
Humane," 
As their " Good Will " efforts oft have proved, 
time and time again. 
The name of " Wm. Penn " we never can forget, 
Nor " Washington," nor " Franklin," and good 
old " Lafayette ;" 
With " Congress," " Robert Morris," " Warren," 
`• Marion " and " Monroe," 
" 
Decatur," " Taylor," •• Ringgold," " Shiffler " 
and " Lincoln," too. 
We've " America" and " Hibernia" boys together

In " Harmony," and " Friendship," and " Fel-
lowship" so grand ; 
With a " Good Intent" to " Rescue," " Assist-
ance " they unfold, 
With a " Mechanic " " Perseverance" and a 
" 
Resolution " bold. 
With a " Hope " and " Neptune's " aid, poured 
forth with speed to save.

}IRE! FIRE 
WRITTEN fly G. W. 13AECOCII. 
Inserted by- permission of Oliver Ditson & Co.. publishers of 
the Music, Washington street, Boston. 
Hark ! ' tis the watchman's rattle, startling the 
mid nIght air, 
And shrieks above it echoing the wild cry of 
despair ; 
See in yon stately mansion that lurid, fearful 
light, 
The tire king and his friends carouse in beauty's 
halls to- night. 
Oh ! what a 
dread awak'ning for those so blithe 
and free, 
A short hour since rejolcing in mirth and revelry , 
Now startleii from their downy couch, amid con-
. 
fltsion dire, 
Surrounded by the stifling 
smoke and forked 
tongue of tire. 
TITE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
Amazed, confused, and terror- struck, they rush 
clown the stair, 
Meeting in dread encounter with the fire-king's 
horrid glare ; 
Help ! help 1 
0 
God, we perish, there is no help, 
and nigher 
The dense smoke closes round them, and the mad 
flames circle higher. 
But, hark ! the gallant fireman's axe tells on the 
oaken door, 
A 
crash, it falls 1 
and torrents dash, and fire reigns 
king no more; 
The noble firemen inward rush, all peril bravely 
dare, 
They scorn the flames; those gallant men are con-
querors of fire. 
With joy again they now return, each a 
helpless 
burden brings, 
They're saved and free from danger, thanks to 
the King of kings, 
And to those noble firemen who so bravely peril 
And quickly fly to danger at the fire- bell's thrilling 
call. 
Oh ! let us each, while kneeling to pray, ere we 
retire, 
That God would bless those noble men, those con-
querors of fire; 
That should he e'er again permit such perils to 
come nigh, 
Those noble men may hear again, Help! help! 
our piercing cry.

THE FIREMAN'S CHILD. 
In;erted by permission of Oliver Ditson & Co., publisher,i of 
Music, 277 Washington street, Boston. 
The night was dark, the tempest howled, 
Oh ! how my mother wept, 
As ment'ry brought the hour back 
When quietly we slept; 
Our dreams of bliss were broken 
By the loudly tolling bell, 
Sounding the dread alarum, Fire! 
Echoed, echoed with the knell. 
With hands and hearts so steady, 
As the cry of fire runs wild, 
Still the motto, "ever ready," 
Is before the fireman's child. 
The motto " ever ready," &- e. 
My father, heedless of the storm, 
Quick to his duty ran, 
With anxious prayer my mother cried, 
Oh ! Heaven preserve each man! 
Till weary hours sad tidings brought, 
Grief did her heart appal, 
My father and his comrades were 
Buried, buried ' neath the wall ! 
With hands and hearts, (R7e. 
But scarce a 
year had passed away, 
Ere of grief my mother died, • 
And left in solitude alone, 
flow often have I 
sighed. 
Yet though an orphan left on earth 
To roam this world so wild, 
Heaven smiles and ne'er deserts

BUTCHER JAKE AND HIS BOSS. 
BY H. ANGELO. 
Air—" Lord Lovell." 
Young Jakey, he stood by the hose house door, 
By the hose house door stood he, 
A wishing the bells for a 
fire would strike, . 
For a 
Fireman active was he, he, he, 
For a 
Fireman active was he. 
While with his companions young Jakey stood 
there, 
While with his companions stood he; , 
Who should come along but his old butcher boss, 
'Fore Jokey had time for to flee, flee, flee, 
'Fore Jokey had time for to flee. 
The boss, he bid Jakey at once to his work, 
For cattle he had to kill three ; 
But Jokey had been up all night at a 
ball, 
And work the next day couldn't see, see, see, 
And work the next day couldn't see. 
While thus his boss there stood, jawin' away, 
The bell for a 
fire struck three ; 
Young Jake, with a 
bound, sprang in for the horn, 
And off with the boys was he, he, he, 
And off with the boys was he. 
His boss made an effort to catch his coat tail, 
But Jokey was smarter than he ; 
And the old man was left at the house all alone, 
While Jokey went off in high glee, glee, glee, 
While Jokey went off in high glee. . 
Toward home the old man then quick wended his 
way, 
'Most cliokin' with anger was he ; 
But as he neared home heat once did behold, 
'Twos his own house on fire, Wye see, see, see, 
'Twos his own house on fire, d'ye see. 
A 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER.

No cattle was slaughtered by Jakey that day, 
But save from destruction did he 
his old boss's house, his cattle and all; 
For that his old man gave him free, free, free. 
For that his old man gave him free. 
WHEN I WAS A. LITTLE CUB. 
Air—" Johnny Sands." 
Oh ! when I 
was a 
little cub 
Not more than just so high, 
The old machine was my delight, 
And with it run would I ; 
My mammy flogg'd me sev'ral times, 
But good it did me none, 
Away I'd slip and with the boys 
I'd have my bit of fun, 
I'd have my 
bit of fun. 
As I 
grew up. the engine house 
it was my chief resort, 
Day in, day out, would I 
be there, 
Quite anxious for the sport ; 
So lively all our fellows seeni'd, 
So ready, too, to run, 
That I 
to be a 
fire boy, 
Did quick resolve upon. 
Did quick resolve upon. 
My mammy bound me to a 
trade, 
And serve I 
did my time, 
But still I 
loved the old machine, 
And joined it in my prime ; 
For snow or rain I 
never cared, 
'Tis true I'll have you know, 
But when the signal given was, 
I'd to the fire go. 
I'd to the fire go. 
16 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
I 
loved to see our comp'ny pass 
All others on the route, 
I 
loved to wield the old house horn, 
And through it loudly shout ; 
I 
loved to be the first one there, 
I 
mean upon the ground, 
I 
loved to lend a 
helping hand, 
When danger did surround, 
When danger did surround. 
Though growing older I'm in years, 
Yet run a 
bit I 
can, 
And when I 
hear the old bell strike, 
I 
go a 
fireman ; 
Then fill me up a 
glass of wine, 
And give I 
will a-

Our Fire Laddies it shall be,

true heart has he; 
Welcome him kindly, hard tho' his hand, 
Mark'd you not how he caught the fire flaming 
brand ? 
Sg1V you not how he toiled your home to save, 
Braving the flames to snatch one from their grave ? 
• 
Hark! a 
cry wildly rings from far above! 
One that is perishing— one that you love ! 
Upward the fireman springs through smoke and 
flame, 
Falling beam, stifling heat, ever the same! 
See ! he has reached her! now he descends ! . 
Saved! God be thanked ! from your full heart 
ascends. 
God rest the Fireman killed at his post ! 
Weep, for a 
man and a 
brother is lost ! 
Scatter bright flowers o'er his lone bed, 
Rear there a 
marble—a 
hero is dead! 
OUT GOES THE STEAMER. 
A 
ir—"Pop Goes the Weasel." 
Our 'Firemen are jolly boys, 
Or set me down a 
dreamer; 
The bell has but to make a 
noise, 
When out goes the steamer 
The signal's all the boys e'er ask, 
Then springs each lively screamer, 
And with speed they'll to their task, 
When out goes the steamer. 
Both life and property to save, 
No souls on earth are keener; 
With willing hands they'll danger brave, 
When out goes the steamer. 
The .signal's all, &c.

The old machine :seems but a 
toy, 
As o'er the stones they skim' her, 
To save which fire would destroy,— 
I. mean our fire steamer. 
The signal's all, &c.. 
Always ready, night or day, 
A Fireman's a

Be the weather what it may, 
Out goes the steamer.

Fill your glasses for a

Fill ye up a

And be the Firemen our boast, 
Of Ladder, Hose and Steamer.

A PHILADELPHIA FIREMAN'S SONG. 
WRITTEN IN 1S16, BY ROBERT S. COFFIN. 
On the bosom of night, when the weary were 
sleeping, 
And the stillness of death lent an awe to the 
scene, 
When mankind, all their woes in forgetfulness 
steeping, 
Were dreaming of joys, in the days that had 
been,— 
Oh ! how dread was the cry, as it broke on their 
slumbers, • 
How awful the sound of the midnight alarm, 
As it fell on the car, and the firemen in numbers 
Re-echoed it back on the slumberer's charm ! 
See the flames spreading round, all the timbers are 
falling, 
The home of the wretched is blazing on high, 
22 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
And the wife of his bosom'for mercy is calling, 
'Till with joy she beholds that Assistance is nigh. 
On the sous of Columbia she places Reliance, 
And a 
firm Resotution and hope in their name, 
Proclaims that the Union will soon bid defiance, 
And their Vigilant efforts extinguish the flame. 
With Diligent strides see old Neptune advances, 
While the stream of compassion pours fast from 
his eyes, 
And the smile of Good Will our labor enhances, 
As Niagara's torrents aset nd to the skies; 
Relief on the pinions of glory appearing, 
Like the spirit of Washington bending from 
heaven, 
With the whispers of peace, the lone sufferer is 
cheering, 
'Till success to our firm Perseverance is given. 
The sons of Hibernia, those boys of good feeling, 
0 l 
long may they smile with an aspect humane! 
Their charitable views, and their honor in dealing, 
Like our venerable Franklin, is free from a 
stain. 
May Fellowship, Friendship and Harmony blend-
ing, 
Still reign from Schuylkill to Delaware's shore, 
And the followers of Penn, Good Intent still ex-
tending, 
Be honored until '
Morris' name is no more. 
Then pledge we the States while our bosoms are 
And swear that we ever undaunted will prove ; 
And Amity's smile, every sorrow dispelling, 
Shall weave for each brow a 
fresh chaplet of love. 
Thy name, Philadelphia, shall flourish for ever; 
'Tis written in Sun-beams— it shines from the 
skies; 
And when the last trump shall the universe sever, 
Like the Phmnix, thy Fame on its ashes shall rise.

SONG OF VICTORY. 
BY H. A. 
Air—" Marching through Georgia." 
Ceased have the puffing steamers, so has the 
water's flow, 
We've conquered in the strife, boys, our old Per-
sistent foe 
Then why not have a 
song now, that I 
should like 
to know, 
As we reach again our quarters. 
Chorus.--Hurrah, hurrah, the fiery foe we've beat, 
Hurrah, hurrah, our vic'try is complete ; 
So we'll shout in chorus and time it with 
our feet, 
As we reach again our quarters. 
How the bells did ring, boys, that hasten'd us 
away, 
How ready too, were we, boys, the signal to obey; 
How the sky was redden'd up, I 
leave you all to 
say, 
As we reach again our quarters. 
Chorus.—Hurrah, hurrah, &c. 
24 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
How we placed the engines, how we seized the 
hose, 
how we climb'd the ladder rounds, and heard the 
trumpet blows, 
And how we battled with the foe, I 
leave Srou to 
suppose, 
As we reach again our quarters. 
Chorus.— Hurrah, hurrah, &c. 
How, when the orders given were, " Take up and 
homeward go," 
The carriage bells did peal aloud, the fire out, you 
know; 
And how our vict'ry makes us feel our little song 
will show, 
As we reach again our quarters. 
Chorus.—Hurrah, hurrah, &c. 
THE FIREMAN'S HEART AND HAND. 
Air—" A 
Wet Sheet and a 
Flowing Sea." 
Amid the flames he stood, 
And the white smoke formed his wreath, 
And the swelling waves of the fiery flood 
Came surging from beneath; 
The crackling timbers reeled, 
And the brands came gleaming down, 
Like the scatter'd wreaths that the forests yield 
When their autumn leaves are brown. 
Chorus.—Amid the flames he stood, 
And the white smoke formed his wreath, 
And the swelling waves of the fiery flood 
Came surging from beneath. 
A 
TILE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
25 
The tempest howled in wrath, 
Ane the fire wheeled madly on ; 
And the embers fir on the wind's wild path 
Through the murky night had gone. 
Yet there in his pride he stood, 
With a 
steady hand and strong; 
And his axe came down on the burning wood 
Till the heart of the ofd oak rang. 
Chorus.—As amid, Sze. 
There was many an earnest eye, 
Through the roping smoke that gazed, 
While he stood, with his dauntless soul, and high 
Where the hottest fire-brands blazed. 
And prayers were faltered forth 
From the aged and the young; 
For the safety of many a 
household hearth 
On the strokes of his strong arm hung. 
Chorus.—As amid, &c. 
There was many a 
proud knight there, 
With his mantle round him roll'd, 
That aloof, in the light of that sweeping fire, 
Stood shivering in the cold. 
And oft from the fireman's hands 
A 
summons for aid was heard ; 
But never the tips of their well-gloved hands 
From their ermined cloaks they stirred. 
Chorus.—As amid, & c. 
And no white and fervent lip 
For their welfare or safety prayed ; 
For no children's weal, and no mother's hope, 
In the strength of their arms was stayed. 
Were I 
searching earth's mingled throng 
For shelter, my claim would be 
A hand like the Fireman's, nerved and strong, 
• 
And a 
fearless heart for me. 
Chorus.—For amid, &c.

THE ROOSTER BOY. 
Oh, I 
am a 
roving bold rooster boy, 
I'm fond of the girls when they don't me annoy, 
I 
runs to tub fire, and I 
knock a 
man down, 
I 
love all the girls that hail from up town. 
I'm a 
rooster! I'm a 
lobster ! I'm a 
bold rooster 
boy 
Oh, I'm a 
rooster! a 
bold rooster boy ! 
The girl that I 
like, her name is, S111 Bat, 
She's a 
roarer ! a 
rooster ! and " all round my hat ;" 
She never walks out, she's so nice and so coy, 
Without she has the arm of her bold rooster boy. 
I'm a 
rooster, &c. 
Jack Romaine and myself had a 
fallin' out one day, 
his attention to my girl the coon wanted to pay ; 
His breastpin, he bragged, was much bigger than 
mine, 
But he wasn't a 
rooster ! so he couldn't shine. 
I'm a 
rooster, &c. 
I 
am a 
proud rooster, as you can easy see, 
And where is the rooster that can crow with me ? 
I've a 
heart like a 
bullock, a 
head like an ox, 
And as for a 
row—D'ye see ? I 
Can box! 
I'm a 
rooster, &c. 
If a 
man ain't a 
rooster, he must be a 
hen, 
And the rooster, you'll own, is most like a 
man, 
Success, then, to the rooster, success, then, to the 
boys 
Who love ' long with the fire machine to run and 
make ,a noise. 
I'm a 
rooster, &c. 
THE FIREMAN'S RETURN. 
Air—" Folks that put on Airs." 
The fire's out, the fire's out, 
The hydrant's rush is past, 
Loud be the cheers, our task is o'er, 
And vict'ry comes at last ;-
The carriage bells ring out a 
peal, 
And orders fly about 
To man the rope, to man the rope, 
And take a 
homeward route. 
(Repeat first four lines for Chorus.) 
There's not a 
storm but follows calm, 
Now doubt that if you can, 
I'm glad I 
joined the old machine, 
To be a 
fireman, 
We've glory won enough, I'm sure, 
To make a 
bit of noise, 
The fire's out, the fire's out, 
Three cheers for that, my boys. 
The fire's out, &c. 
The old machine is housed again, 
The horn hangs by the door; 
Our fire rig we have exchanged 
For that of Cit's once more. 
With pride we speak now of our work, 
While round in groups we stand, 
With pride the faithful fire dog, 
Too, mingles with our band. 
The fire's out, & c. 
28 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
The bell has but to strike again, 
That calls the boys away ; 
Then heart and hand we'll to our work, 
The fire-fiend to slay. 
Through all the danger that he braves, 
Of smoke and raging flames, 
'Tis life and property to save, 
The fireman but aims.

BY J. A. HARDWICK. 
What. a 
grumbling man the policemen is, 
As he hastens fruit stalls to floor ; 
What a 
terrible staff his hands contain, 
To knock down the low and the poor 
In many a 
place to get up a 
case, 
His bulls-eye he turns on, to see 
If any unlucky wight he can charge 
With assault and battery. 
Every night about twelve o'clock, 
Somebody feels the policeman's knock. Repeat 
34 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
A man going home rather late from his club, 
With his staff sometimes he'll floor, 
Then swear he could only the villain lock up, 
With the aid of two or three more. 
A friend or two quietly walking alonz, 
He swears were disturbing the peace ; 
But halt' the disturbances would never occur, 
If it wasn't for the police. 
Every night, & c. 
What a 
wonderful man the policeman is— 
That never a 
tire takes place, 
But he gets the credit of smelling it out, 
When perhaps not near the place ! • 
And when, on his beat, he clears the street 
Of inciter boys and girls, 
And a 
poor old woman's basket of apples 
He into the gutter hurls ! 
Every night, & c. 
What a 
hungry man the policeman is ! 
He looks after the nice tit- bits; 
From the servant- maid at area gates, 
How many a 
supper he gets. 
He likes the cooks, down kitchen he looks, 
When the family's gone to bed, 
And regales himself—then sallies out 
To break some poor devil's head. 
Every night, & c. 
May his visits be seldom to people's abodes, 
Their larders and pantries to clear, 
And never, we hope, to the station-house 
Off any of us he may bear. 
Far, far be the day, when a 
policeman shows 
To any of us the cell door ; 
Then long life, my dear friends, to you all, I 
now 
say, 
And may you no policeman floor. 
Every night, & c.

PARODY ON BEN BOLT. 
BY A B'HOY. 
Oh, don't you remember the b'hoys, Jim Holmes, 
The b'hoys with noses so red, 
Who drank with delight wherever they met, 
And always went drunk to bed ? 
In the old grave yard in the edge of the town, 
In corners obscure and alone, 
They, have gone to rest, for the gay young spirits 
have dropped off, one by one. 
Oh, don't you remember the jug, Jim Holmes, 
And the spring at the foot of the hill, 
Where oft we have lain thro' the hot summer hour, 
And drank to our utmost fill? 
The spring is filled with mud, Jim Holmes, 
And the wild hogs root all around, 
And the good old jug, with its whisky so sweet, 
Lies broken and spilled On the ground. 
Oh, don't you remember the tavern, Jim Holmes, 
And the bar- keeper kind and true, 
And thelittle nook at the end of the bar, 
Where we drank the beer that he drew ? 
The tavern is burned to the ground, Jim Holmes, 
The bottles are cracked and dry '•  
And of all the boys who spreed it then, 
There remains, Jim, but you and I. 
There's a 
change in the things I 
love, Jim Holmes, 
Of some tis .right sorrowful to think, 
For we feel that the wrongs are grievous to bear, 
When they change, now, to ten cents a 
drink. 
Many the months that have passel, Jim Holmes, 
There is change from the old to the new, 
But friends will be false and friendship will change, 
Ere I 
refuse, Jim, to drink with you.

LINES ON THE DEATH OF D. M. LYLE,* 
BY RICHARD COG. 
Gone from the night of a 
temporal sorrow ; 
Gone. to the morn of an eternal morrow; 
Gone to the friends who looked lovingly for him ; 
Gone to the skies that bent smilingly o'er him ! 
Who shall lament when a 
brother so kindly, 
(Over our faults he .did ever look blindly,) 
Goes from the field of his toil and his labor 
To the rest which remains for who loveth his 
neighbor ? 
His was no heart that did beat for a 
faction ; 
His motto in life was e'er '• Prompt to Action "t 
To friend or to foe, to do good was his meaning ; 
He erred on the side towards charity leaning.

WHISKY, YOU'RE A VILLYAN. 
AS SUNG BY MR. FRANK DREW. 
Music published by Marsh's, 1029 Chestnut Street. 
Oh! whisky, you're a 
villyan, you led me astray 
Over bogs, over briers, and out of my way; 
You wrestled me a 
fall, and you threw me to- day, 
But I'll toss you to- morrow, when Pm sober. 
Still, whisky, you're my comfort by night and by 
day, 
You're stronger and sweeter, and spunkier than tay, 
One naggin of spirits is worth tuns of bohay, 
But above a 
pint I 
never could get over. 
Sweet whisky, you're a coaxer, I'd 'best keep 
away,

To drink no more whisky, till Pm sober. 
So good bye, whisky, jewel, it's the last word

Come, firemen, arouse, from your slumbers awake I 
See the flames how they glare on the sky; 
The alarm bell is sounding, awake, awake, 
And start at the watchman's cry. 
No toil can dishearten, no danger affright, 
As we cheerfully hasten away, 
In the heat of the day, or the dead of the night, 
We're ready the call to obey. 
Then, firemen, arouse, from your slumbers awake ; 
See the flames how they glare on the sky; 
The hall bell is sounding, awake, awake, 
And start at the watchman's cry. 
Turn out, lads, turn out, lads, 
Fire ! fire ! turn out. 
Let other men lov%the Spring so mild, 
When the sunbeams gild the sky ; 
But the time for us is the winter wild, 
When the storm is howling high. 
All danger we laugh at, all toil we scorn,

In the warm summer's (lay, or cold winter's night, 
Were ready the call to obey.

THE FIREMAN'S LIFE. 
BY R. P. S. 
The fireman's life is a 
dangerous life ; 
Our highest praise he claims ; 
For he plunges in through the fearful din, 
Where roll the smoke and flames, 
lie hews down the beam, where the fire- sparks 
gleam, 
And be breaks through roof and wall, 
Through the blazing door, o'er the crackling floor, 
He rushes at duty's call. 
The fireman'slife is a 
gallant life ; 
All dangers will he brave 
To rescue mother and father and child 
From death and a 
fiery grave. 
Oh, never cares he if the perishing be 
Of high or of lowly grade. 
Unflinching he goes where the red heat glows : 
Success to each fire brigade !. 
The fireman's life is a 
noble 
And from it we may learn 
To do and to dare, be the thing what it may, 
At the call of duty stern. 
To give up the home for whose quiet ease 
We have so stoutly striven, 
To part from the friends we have loved for years, 
And leave the result to heaven !

Ye faithful band, whose gallant hearts 
Are generous, warm and true, 
Columbia's daughter proudly wakes 
Her country's harp for you. 
Well has she taught its silken chords 
To breathe your peerless name, 
While memory waves her snowy plumes 
And sings your deeds of fame. 
Chorus.—Hall, faithful band, whose gallant hearts 
Are generous, warm, and true, 
Columbia's daughter proudly wakes 
Her country's harp for you. 
I've marked the vivii lightning's flash, 
And heard the thunder's roar ; 
I've seen The white- capped billows dash 
Along the pebbly shore. 
I've watched the oarsman as he toiled 
To save his snattered bark, 
When clouds hung heavy o'er the deep, 
And all was drear and dark. 
Hail faithful band, &c. 
But 0 ! there is 'a scene more wild 
Than tempests sweeping by, 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
A dwelling wrapped in wreathing flames 
That lume the midnight sky ; 
When daring hearts and giant arms 
The threaVning danger brave, 
Nor swerve they from the foremost ranks 
While there is aught to save. 
Hail, faithful band, &c. 
On, on, regardless of their fate, 
With calm and fearless eye; 
Impetuous through the reeking fire 
Those dauntless spirits fly. 
The cruel blast, with icy breath, 
May chill each manly form, 
Yet firmly to their post they stand 
Amid the wildest storm. 
Hail, faithful band, &c. 
No glittering treasure prompts their zeal, 
But 0 ! they justly claim 
The laurel wreath that friendship twines 
Around the conqueror's name. 
Guards of our city and our homes, 
Those dearest spots of earth, 
Fain would our grateful souls record 
Your deeds of noble worth. 
Hail, faithful band, &c.

Oft have we knelt at silent eve 
By many a

And lit the torch of hope again 
With words of kind relief.

BEFORE MY HAIR WAS GRAY. 
Inserted by permission of Marsh & Bubna, 1029 Chestnut Street, 
Philadelphia. 
You bid me sing, oh lady bright, 
A 
song of other years ; 
There was an hour my heart was light, 
My eyes unused to tears; 
My voice had then no broken string, 
And all its notes were gay, 
That was the time when I 
could sing, 
Betbre my hair was gray. 
That was the time when 1 
could sing, 
Before my hair was gray. 
Chorus.—And so amidst the frosts of age, 
Bright thoughts no longer stray, 
I 
was more merry, though less sage, 
Before my hair was gray. 
• 
The very birds, when falls the snow, 
Rejoice the woods no more ; 
You only hear the breezes blow 
Their music round the door. 
And so, amidst the frosts of age, 
Bright thoughts no longer stray, 
I 
was more merry, though less sage, 
Before my hair was gray. 
I 
was more merry, though less sage, 
Before my hair was gray. 
And so amidst, Sc,c. 
Then, lady, bid me not to sing, 
But sing a 
by-gone strain— 
A 
touching, soft, pathetic thing, 
That tells of lover's pain ; 
And then, perhaps, forgetting all 
The sad past in to day.

THE FEW FEET OF CLAY. 
47 
Inserted by permission of Marsh St Co., 1029 Chestnut St., Phila. 
Though lofty our station, or splendid our wealth, 
With knowledge though gifted, or dowered with 
health, 
Oh, trust not in these, for no man can gainsay, 
That all must soon come to the few feet of clay. 
Take comfort, ye lowly, with envious eye, 
Who watch from your garrets the wealthy flaunt 
by; 
Death bounteous will make you as rich as are they; 
E'en rank bows its head to the few feet of clay. 
The warrior,' the statesman, or man of renown, 
Who misleads a 
nation, or sacks a 
brave town, 
Beholds his ambition, his fame die away, 
When come to the brink of the few feet ot clay. 
Thou widow, who mournest for him who has gone 
Whcre the gay and the weary alike will be borne; 
Oh, sorrow no more, for it is but a 
day, 
Till thoult share his couch in the few feet of clay. 
Thou poor stricken mother! oh! weep not for him, 
Thy dear sailor lad whose blue eyes are now dim; 
His spirit shall soar, though his body may lay, 
Entomb'd in the sea eaves, or wrapt in the clay. 
These dark withered forms, to the loud trumpet 
call, 
When time shall be dying the last day of all, 
Immortal shall rise in a 
brighter array, 
And the spirit shall triumph over the clay.

THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
THE FIREMAN'S ADDRESS. 
BY BON. ROBERT T. CONRAD. 
The city slumbers. 
O'er its mighty walls 
Night's dusky mantle soft and silent falls ; 
Sicep o'er the world slow waves its wand of lead, 
And ready torpors wrap each sinking head. 
Stilled is the stir of labor and of life 
Hushed is the hum, and tranquilized the strife; 
Man is at rest, with all his hopes and fears ; 
The young forget their sports, the old their cares ; 
The grave or careless, those who joy or weep, 
All rest contented on the arm of sleep. . 
Sweet is the pillowed rest of beauty now, 
And slumber smiles upon her tranquil brow ; 
Her bright dreams lead her to the Moonlit tide, 
Her heart's own partner wandering by her side. 
'Tis summer's eve ; the soft gales scarcely rouse 
The low-voiced ripple and the rustling boughs ; 
And, faint and far, some minstrel's inciting tone 
Breathes to her heart a 
music like its own. 
When hark ! Oh horror ! what a 
crash is there ! 
What shriek is that which fills the midnight air ? 
'Tis fire ! ' tis fire ! She wakes to dream no more ! 
The hot blast rushes through the blazing door ! 
The dun smoke eddies round ; and hark ! that cry ! 
" 
Help ! help ! Will no one aid ? I 
die !—I 
die !' 
She seeks the casement ! shuddering at its height 
She turns again ; the fierce flumes mock her flight; 
Along the crackling stairs they fiercely play, 
And roar, exulting, as they seize their prey. 
" 
Help ! help! Will no one come ?" 
She can no 
more, 
But, pale and breathless, sinks upon the floor. 
Will no one save thee ? Yes, there yet is one 
Remains to save, when hope itself is gone; 
When all have fled, when all but he would fly, 
The Fireman comes, to rescue or to die ! 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
49 
He mounts the stair—it wavers ' neath his tread ; 
He seeks the room—flames flashing round his head: 
He bursts the door; he lifts her prostrate frame, 
And turns again to brave the raging flame. 
The fire blast smites him with its stifling breath ; 
The falling timbers menace him with death ; 
The sinking floors his hurried steps betray ; 
And ruin crashes round his desperate way. 
Hot smoke obscures— ten thousand cinders rise, 
Yet still he staggers forward with his prize. 
Ilk leaps from burning stair to stair. 
On ! on ! 
Courage! One effort more, and all is won ! 
The stair is passed, the blazing hall is braved, 
Still on! Yet on! Once more! 
Thank Heaven, 
she's saved. 
The hardy seaman pants the storm to brave, 
For beek'ning Fortune woos him from the wave ; 
The soldier battles ' neath his smoky shroud, 
For Glory's bow is painted on the cloud; 
The Fireman also dares each shape of death— 
But not for fortune's gold nor glory's wreath. 
No selfish throbs within their breasts are known ; 
No hope of praise or profit cheers them on. 
They ask no meed, no fame ; and only seek - 
To shield the suffering and protect the weak ! 
For this the howling midnight storm they woo ; 
For this the raging flames rush fearless thro'; 
Mount the frail rafter—thrid the smoky hall— 
Or toil, unshrinking, ' neath the tottering wall ; 
Nobler than they, who, with fraternal blood, 
Dye the dread field or tinge the shuddering flood— 
O'er their firm ranks no crimson banners wave ; 
They dare—they suffer—not to slay— but save! 
At such a 
sight, Hope smiles more heavenly bright; 
Pale, pensive Pity trembles with delight ; 
And soft-eyed Mercy, stooping from above, 
Drops a 
bright tear—a 
tear of joy and love ! 
And should the Fireman, generous, true and brave, 
5 
50 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
Fall as he toils, the weak to shield and save ? 
Shall no kind friend, no ministering hand be found 
To pour the balm of comfort in his wound ? 
Or should he perish, shall his orphans say, 
He died for them—but what for us do they ?" 
Say, is it thus we should his toils requite? 
Forbid it, Justice, Gratitude and Right! 
Forbid it, ye who dread what he endures ; 
Forbid it, ye whose slumbers he secures; 
Forbid it, ye whose hoards he toils to save ; 
Forbid it, all ye generous, just and brave 
And, above all, be you his friends, ye fair, 
For you were ever his especial care; 
Give to his cause your smiles, your gentle aid— 
The Fireman's wounds are healed— the orphan's 
tears are stayed I 
MY JOLLY RED NOSE. 
A 
ir—" Derry Down." 
As you wish me to sing, a 
few words I 
shall say 
About my own self, just to pass time away : 
I 
am ugly, ' tis true ; that every friend knows, 
And ' tis all through my having a 
jolly red nose. 
Derry down, & c. 
To a 
ball or a 
rout I 
am often invited, 
A 
nd with all the quadrilles I 
am quite delighted ; 
Bat I 
can't get a 
partner— so the cause, I 
suppose, 
Is all through my having a 
jolly red nose. 
Derry down, & c. 
I 
return home at night and feel nearly dead, 
Through walking about, so I 
haste to my bed, 
And I 
lay my head down; but I 
can't get repose, 
For the fleas come and bite at my jolly red nose. 
Derry down, &c. 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
51 
An old friend in my travels I 
now and then meet, 
And we laugh and we chat as we stand in the 
street ; 
But he looks at my head, then down at my toes, 
And, lastly, he looks at my jolly red nose. 
Derry down, &c. 
Now perhaps you would like for me to relate 
How I 
manage to live, as my woes are so great ; 
I've one consolation, and clearly it shows, 
That much better than 11011b is my jolly red nose. 
Derry down, &c.

THE FIREMAN'S CHANT. 
BY JAMES BUCKLEY. 
Hush! hush! hush! hush! 
No sound—no sound 
Is heard—is heard around, 
Save the watchman's tramp 
And the watchman's club, 
As he taps on the frozen ground. 
Chorus.— All the world's asleep, 
And the moon cloth peep, 
Right through the clear blue sky; 
The stars shine bright 
On a 
wintry night, 
And hushed is every sigh. 
1st voice.— Oh, don't you hear the clatter ? 
2nd voice.—Oh, will you stop dat patter ? 
3d voice.—What de deuce can be de matter? 
Chorus.—Fire !

2d voice.—Rumble, tumble, tumble, rumble. 
1st voice.—Make ready, my boys, don't you hear 
the bells jingle ? 
2d voice.—Jingle, tingle, dingle, bingle. 
Chorus.— Down she goes! down she goes 
Down she goes! down she goes! 
Unscrew the pipe, 
Reel up the hose ! 
The fire is now got under 
The flames of the night, 
Which upward rose 
Are now in peaceful slumber. 
THE FIREMAN'S DEATH. 
Words by Francis Smith. 
Music by A. Sedgwick. 
He slept, and o'er his dauntless brow 
A 
shade of sorrow stole, 
As though some scene of deep distress 
Was busy with his soul, 
hen suddenly the dread alarm, 
Come ringing shrill and clear, 
Cleaving the night air till it struck 
Upon his startled ear. 
Chorus.—Ile bounded up: his practiced eye, 
Was turn'd upon the lurid sky, 
Lit by the flames, which mounting 
higher, 
Soon cloth'd the night in a 
robe of fire. 
With lightning speed he reach'd the scene— 
Oh ! what a 
sight was there ! 
A mother stood amid the flames, 
And shrieked in wild despair ! 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
Her arms around her frightened babe 
Were thrown with frenzied clasp, 
As though she feared the fire- fiend 
Would tear it from her grasp. 
With helmet turn'd, -through fire and smoke, 
The gallant fellow fearless broke.; 
lie saves them both, but au I 
his life 
Was lost in the unequal strife. 
Now in`sweet Greenwood's peaceful shade 
The noble hero sleeps, 
And o'ef his grave full many a 
friend 
In silent sorrow weeps. 
A monument erected there 
Is pointed to with pride 
By those with whom he has fought, 
The fire, side by side. 
Sweet flow'rs exhale their fragrant breath, I 
Where now he peaceful sleeps in death ; 
And trees their spreading branches wave 
Above his solemn Greenwood grave. 
THE FIREMAN'S CALL. 
Don't you hear the bell, boys; 
Turn out! Turn out! 
.Its booming peals are on the air, 
While all around is lurid glare ; 
Don't you hear the bell, boys ? 
Turn out! turn out ! 
Don't you see the light, boys ? 
Turn out ! Turn out ! 
Start up the engine's rattling wheels, 
And spurn the pavement with your heels ; 
Don't you see the light, boys ? 
Turn out ! Turn out !

Never faint nor flag, boys! 
Play on! Play on ! 
For where we pour the steady stream, 
See, all is white with hissing steam ; 
Never faint nor flag, boys! 
Play on! Play on!

All out ! All out!

Charred and blackened are the walls !

Shed your influence o'er us ;

As the honey bee sips from the rose. 
Then the toast, then the toast be dear woman, 
Let each breast that is manly approve ; 
Then the toast, then the toast be dear woman! 
And nine cheers for the girls that we love. 
Hip, hip, hip, hurrah ! 
Come, raise, raise the wine cup to heaven high, 
Ye gods on Olympus approve; 
The offering thus mellowed by woman's bright eye, 
Outrivals the nectar of Jove. 
Then raise high the goblet with transport, 
The spell of life's best joys impart, 
The cup thus devoted to woman, 
Yields the only true balm to the heart.

Now rum was not the thing for me, and as the

We're all shooting, our troubles quick to end. 
When first we enter life, and in this world take

By Nature you'll allow we're all first taught to 
shoot, 
So I 
hope you'll own ' tis true— for I'll prove it by

From an infant in the arms we soon shoot up to a 
man.

MY FRIENDS. 
Air—" Derry Down." 
Some people contend they're surrounded by foes, 
That this man and that are the cause of their woes ; 
But I 
have remark'd, and 'tis proved in the end, 
There's less to be feared from a 
foe than a 
friend. 
Derry down, &c. 
" 
My friend," is a 
common expression, ' tis true, 
My friend, how's your mother ? My friend, how 
, are you ? 
In such friendship, if friendship we really could see, 
What a number of friends in this world there 
would be. 
Derry down, &c. 
My friend Mr. A, and my friend Mr. B, 
They both came to dine with their friend, Mr. C; 
But twixt the two former a 
quarrel arose, 
The friends got to words, and from words went to 
blows. 
Derry down, &c. 
A called B a 
blackguard, B called A an ass, 
'Tis shocking what things among friends come to 
pass— 
A sent B a 
challenge—determined to fight, 
For the pistols, of course, they would show which 
was right. 
Derry down, &c. 
The challenge was sent ( through a 
friend, by the 
bye), 
A 
friend brought the answer, B 
wouldn't deny; 
Friends measured the distance—gave signals and 
all, 
And with satisfaction, saw both of them fall. 
Derry down, & c.

TIIE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
Now B had a 
bullet shot went through his hat, 
But as to his head, there was nothing in that ;; 
A fractured his arm, and despair'd of his life, 
So his friend, very kindly, ran off with his wife. 
Derry down, &c. 
But friends are the same, you may go where you 
will, 
Did you e'er put your name, for a 
friend, to a 
bill ? 
For sometimes it happens, I 
know that it's true, 
The friend, in all friendship, forgets when it's due. 
Derry down, &c. 
Thus I 
could go on for an hour or more, 
But my friends, no doubt, wish my ditty was o'er; 
So, I'll close with advice to all good natured elves, 
While you act well to others, take care of your-
selves. 
Deny down, &c.

All hail to our glorious army 
And gallant navy, too ; 
All honor to our volunteers, 
A

But other bards have sung of them, 
The praises of the three 
And I 
will sing of the Fireman 
Who chants so merrily, 
'Who chants so merrily,

Work, boys, with a

For most dire dreaded fire, 
We will conquer still.

Oh! noble looks the Fireman 
As dressed in black and red, 
He pushes proudly through the crowd, 
With gay and cheerful tread ; 
An axe he carries by his side, 
A helmet on his head, 
And thus he goes to fight a 
foe, 
Most powerful and dread, 
Most powerful and dread, 
Most powerful and dread. 
Then man, &c. 
And let us not forget his friend, 
A comrade true and brave; 
The ladder-man who does ascend 
From horrid death to save. 
In truth they are a 
worthy pair, 
And serve a 
noble cause; 
They each deserve a 
hero's praise, 
And honest men's applause, 
And honest men's applause, 
And honest men's applause.

A CHAPTER OF NAILS. 
Air—Bow, Wow, Wow. 
My merry, gentle people, pray 
,Will you list a 
minute, 
For though my song it is not long, 
There's something comic in it. 
To sing of nails, if you'll permit, 
My sportive muse intends, sirs, 
A subject which I 
now have pat 
Just at my fingers' ends, sirs. 
Yes, yes, yes, 
Ri fol de riddle, 
Yes, yes, yes. 
66 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
The world it is a 
bag of nails, 
And some are very queer ones, 
And some are flats, and sonic are sharps, 
And some are very dear ones. 
We've sprigs, and spikes, and sparables, 
Some little, great, and small, sir, 
Some folks love nails with monstrous heads, 
And some love none at all, sir. 
Yes, yes, yes, &-,
c. 
The bachelor's a 
bob-nail, 
He rusts for want of use, sir ; 
The misers they're no nails at all, 
They're all a 
pack of screws, sir. 
An enemy will get some clouts 
If here they chance to roam, sir, 
Yankee boys, like hammers, will 
Be sure to drive them home, sir. 
Yes, yes, yes, S:c. 
The doctor nails you with his bill, 
Which often proves a 
sore nail ; 
The undertaker wishes you 
As dead as any door nail. 
You'll often find each agent 
To be nailing his employer ; 
The lawyer nails his client, 
And the devil nails the lawyer. 
Yes, yes, yes, & c. 
Dame Fortune is a 
brad awl, 
And often does contrive it 
To make each nail go easily 
Where'er she please to drive it. 
Then, if I 
gain your kind applause 
For what I 
sung or said, sir, 
Then you'll admit that I 
have hit 
The right nail on the head, sir.

can prove to you its merit ere ' tis

To the sex

my days, 
And it's my intention now to sing in woman's 
praise. 
I'll prove that lovely women is a 
man's best friend, 
sticking back and edge to him till life (loth end. 
That man who'd single go had better be below, 
But what man would be without a woman, I 
should like to know? 
That man, &e. 
If a 
man has got a 
wife, he may lead a 
happy life, 
Although at times the best of folks may have a 
lit-
tle strife; 
Woman's tongue must use its power, but her pas-
sion's like a 
shower 
In April, when there's storm and sunshine all 
within an hour. 
A man had better let a 
woman have her way, 
And let her chatter, chatter, chatter all the day ; 
For though her tongue may go in scandal too, or so, 
What man would have a 
woman dumb, I'd really 
like to know ? 
For though, 4.7c. 
At home she's man's best friend, for him she'll 
wash and mend, 
And unto all his many wants she will attend;

But a 
single man, it's true, for himself must boil or 
stew ; 
Must mend his clothes, must wash his shirt, and 
molly coddle, too. 
A 
married man to happy be can never fail, 
But a 
single man is like a 
dog without a 
tail 
Poor and ragged he may go, unless he'd botch and 
sew; 
What man would be a 
molly all his life, I'd like to 
know ? 
Poor and ragged, &c. 
A house without a 
fair is like a 
desert drear, 
A garden with no flowers, or vegetation near • 
Like a 
tail without a 
head, or bedstead with no 
bed; 
So, lads, if you're not silly, you will quickly go 
and wed. 
single life you will find to be a 
bitter pill, 
No one to soothe or nurse you, if by chance you're 
ill ; 
But a 
woman, I 
can show, is man's only joy be-
low; 
So, what man would be without a 
woman, I 
should 
like to know. 
But woman, &c.

SONG. 
Air—" Things I 
don't like to See." 
I've heard an old proverb, and thinking it true, 
I've no great objection to tell it to you, . 
For not one out of twenty will ever deny 
But they all, in their turn, love a 
drop in their eye. 
The spirit you'll find, is the Quaker's desire, 
And in waiting for' t 
hours, why his spirit don't tire, 
While the virgin of eighty declares with a 
sigh, 
There's nothing can equal a 
drop in the eye. 
I've heard, & c. 
70 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
Though parsons so often sobriety preach, 
They find a 
hard matter to do as they teach ; 
For whilst against other folks' vices they cry 
Every soul of them's fond of a 
drop in their eye. 
Our ministers, too, at tile head of affairs, 
In the bowl often drown all their troubles and cares, 
Which, no doubt is the reason in these times of 
trouble, 
They oft in the treasury hap to see double. 
I've heard, &c. 
THE BEAUTIFUL BOY. 
Air—"Darling Old Stick." 
It was in the winter ' bout six in the morn, 
When I, little innocent creature, was born; 
There was doctor and nurse, and a 
great many 
more, 
But none of them saw such a 
baby before, 
They all swore I 
was like my papa, oh! 
And there is the nose of mamma; 
With a 
few alterations, oh, In ! 
Will make him a 
beautiful boy. 
To make him a 
beauty, cried out Mrs. Sneer, 
We'll be troubled without the child has a 
sweet 
leer : 
Then to give me this leer, Mrs. Glazier arose, 
And a 
piece of red putty stuck bang on my nose, 
This made me wink and blink so 
The ladies knew not what to think, oh, 
At last it turn'd into a 
squint so, 
All to make me a 
beautiful boy. 
THE FIREMEN'S SONGSTER. 
71. 
To make me accomplished they said I 
wanted one 
thing, 
My mouth was too small for the dear child to sing: 
Then to lug it and pull it they all of them tried, 
'Till they stretch's my sweet mouth near half a 
yard wide, 
Crying, pull away now, Mrs. Ryder, 
It must be a 
little bit wider, 
My dear mouth they split pretty nigh, sir, 
All to make me a 
beautiful boy. 
Now being complete, I 
was next sent to school, 
And to show off my make was stuck on a 
high 
stool ; 
-When the children went home, they cried out with 
surprise, 
We've a new boy at school with such beautiful 
eyes, 
IIe can look any way so handy, 
Such a 
mouth he has got to suck candy, 
And his legs are so preciously bandy, 
And they call him the beautiful boy. 
rother (
lay I 
was ask'd in the city to dine ; 
The ladies, in raptures, all thought me divine ; 
And all, when observing my elegant grace, 
Neglected their dinner to gaze on my face. 
They cried, " I 
shall faint with surprise, 
No gas light can equal his eyes, 
And such a 
sweet mouth for mince pies, 
Oh ! dear, What a 
beautiful boy." 
Now, ladies., 
beware of love's powerful darts, 
For fearful I 
am I 
shall steal all your' beafts ; 
And then, you sweet, dear little creatures, you'll 
sigh, 
And dote on my charms, so you'll languish and die. 
For you know I 
can't marry you all; 
Yet believe me, whenever you call, 
My endeavors will be to please you all, 
Although such a 
beautiful boy.

A COMIC PARODY BY THE B'HOYS. 
My pretty Sal, my pretty Sal, 
Ali ! do not wink your eye ; 
But meet me in the Bowery, 
When the stars are in the sky. 
When the sewing girls, with foreheads shaved, 
Are tripping home so smirk-
-White stockings on their pretty feet, 
With heels of open-work. 
Hark ! hark ! the hall bell's a 
ringing, love, 
And I'm a 
volunteer ; 
List to the clattering tramp of feet— 
I 
must not linger here. 
The wedding ring is already bought, 
You'd better name the day ; 
For if you don't, I'll marry Kate, 
What lives across the way. 
Then say when we shall wed, my love, 
For the time is on the wing ; 
The engine shall be hung in green, 
And fire bells shall ring. 
My pretty Sal, my pretty Sal, 
Ah ! do not wink your eye ; 
But meet me in the Bowery-, 
When the stars are in the sky. •
