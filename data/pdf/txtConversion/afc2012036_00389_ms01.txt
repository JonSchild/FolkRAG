Briana O’Higgins interviewing Jo Wood 
 
February 15, 2013 – Wichita Sedgwick County Historical Museum 
 
 
 
Will you start with your name and your position at Boeing? 
 
Jo Wood, I was a material expediter 
 
Are you from Wichita? 
 
Yes. 
 
When You were growing up were you aware of Boeing? 
 
Yes. 
 
Did any of your family members work at Boeing? 
 
No. 
 
How about now? 
 
No. 
 
Just you? 
 
Just me. 
 
Did you go to a college or university? 
 
I went to Hutch JuCo, but I didn’t finish and I took some classes at WSU while I was 
at Boeing. 
 
Was Boeing your first employer? 
 
No.  
 
Will you talk about your career path? 
 
Oh gosh, let me see I have held a number of jobs, you know. From  I worked in a dry 
cleaners, I worked for DIllards department store, and then I went to um, Cessna 
Aircraft and I was at Cessna five years and was laid off in 1980 and that’s when I 
went to Boeing, 1980. And I retired in 2011.  
 
How did you get into aircraft? What lead up to that first Cessna job? 
 
Well you know, I, uh, wanted a job that paid well and that had benefits. And um, the 
aircraft around here was good you know, a good paying job and they had benefits so 
I applied at Cessna, tried for two years to get on at Cessna and finally got on. And 
then after five years I was laid off uh, in between that time I had applied at Boeing 
for probably three years, you know, trying to get on to Boeing. And then when I left, 
um, Cessna was laid off, I applied at Boeing and got hired. 
 
What was your job at Cessna, your first job? 
 
I was a material cutter, fabric cutter, upholstery cutter. I cut the fabric. 
 
For like the seats? 
 
Yes. I cut fabric, I cut carpet, I cut insulation, but mostly I was a fabric cutter. I would 
fill in on the others when needed. 
 
So when you were laid off from Cessna, um, were you hired right away at Boeing? 
Was there a gap? 
 
It was probably about a month, a month gap. 
 
That’s not too bad. 
 
No, that’s not too bad. I got lucky. 
 
What were you doing at Boeing when you got hired? 
 
When I first started at Boeing? I worked at the PCA as a stock attendant. You know 
putting away stock, issuing stock. That kind of thing.  
 
And then it sounds like your career, your job changed over the time you were at 
Boeing… 
 
Right well, to go into a expediter that was an upgrade, so I applied for the upgrade 
and received the upgrade. They call it expediter, then it was material processor later 
on. And um, I stayed there until I retired. 
 
Did they train you…? Will you talk about what your job was after you switched out 
of the stocking and did they give you training and stuff like that? 
 
Well, initially you went with another expeditor, in my case I was probably with 
another expeditor for a few hours and then at that time uh, expedite would get print 
out reports or hand written reports back then actually, they didn’t have computers 
back then. We got handwritten reports and we would just go from the time the raw 
materials came in, thorough all the processes, expedite the parts through all the 
processes until it went on the plane. So there wasn’t a whole lot of training there, 
you did it on your own back then. They would expect you just to pick it up and do it. 
And that’s what you did. 
 
Were there other women workers in your area? 
 
When I was in stock, yes. Uh, then women were just breaking in to the expediting, it 
was pretty much held by the men, uh, but yeah the women were just breaking in to 
the expedite and then as it went on there were, you know, a lot of women in the 
expedite. 
 
What was it like being one of the first women doing that sort of work? 
 
Well it was… they expected you, I think they kind of put a little more on the woman 
just to see  if she could do the job, and then if you could do the job you went on and if 
you didn’t they may have put you back into stock. You know, it was different when I 
worked at Cessna. And I love Cessna. Cessna was a, back then, and I was hired in in 
’75, and it was a really family place. You know, the people were really nice. But when 
I initially applied for the job it was hard getting in, it was hard as a woman getting 
into the job I was in. Because you were required to lift heavy rolls of fabric, and uh, 
when I first went in the gentleman that interviewed me, um, they stored insulation 
above the cutting tables. So, and I am 5’4, so the racks were probably a good eight 
feet from the floor. And when I went in, when he interviewed me I had to take the 
big rolls of insulation, and they were probably around 3 ft round. And I had to put 
them up on the rack standing on the floor. Which I did. But after I got hired in then I 
noticed that the men, when they went to store it got on top of the tables. And they 
handed it up to one another and put it ip. So you know, it was a little …. You know 
they required the women to do a little bit differently. You know. But you know, any 
job you get in there and you learn the shortcuts, you know, and I was glad to be 
hired on at Cessna. Because that was the first job that I had that actually paid good 
wages and had good benefits and that was important.  
 
What was the culture like at Boeing with your coworkers did they joke around and 
treat you like… 
 
Oh yeah, yeah. Those were good people, good people. You know, I enjoyed working 
at Cessna and Boeing. You know, I mean you have your difficult moments in any job. 
But the people were really good, fun, you know we joked around. Couldn’t take it too 
far you know, but… a lot of them did HAHAHA. You know, but that was the mentality 
back then, you know, but. They guys really put it on the women when they first 
come in. To see if they could hack it I guess. To see if they could do it. So it was… 
uh… so all in all they were good peple to work with. I enjoyed my time there. 
 
Did you feel like you constantly had to prove yourself to the men, or was it like once 
you did you were in, and it was smooth? 
 
Well, no. You had to continueally prove yourself to the men. Espeically back in the 
70s and ealrly 80s. You had to constantly prove yourself, you know, because you 
would, uh, you would be in meetings and you would make a statement and they 
wouldn’t really listen. They would kind of off handed blow you off. But then a man 
would make the same statement, “Oh, that’s a good idea.” You know? SO it was that 
type of thing initially. But it got better as you went on.  
 
Uhhh, I lost my question… 
 
I had one supervisor when I went into expediting at Boeing and he would call 
around checking on me from shop to shop. You know, call the manager and check 
how I was doing and all. And I happened to be in the shop one day and he called and 
I was talking to the manager about the parts, and the manager indicated on the 
phone that it was my boss. And I said, “Well let me talk to him.” Haha. And I took the 
phone and I said, “Ray, what would you like?” And he said, oh well I was just 
calling… Now this manager was really notorious for practical jokes and you know, 
but he would call around and check on me. And I just took the phone and said, “wel 
what did you want?” And he said, “well I just wanted to know how this part was 
doing and when we were going to have it out.” And I said, “Well, isn’t that what I am 
here for?” And he said, “well Yeah.” And I said, “Well then please don’t be calling 
around checking on me.” Because we have daily meetings usually in the morning or 
mid morning. We would have a meeting on status update, especially on shutdown 
items. And they would expect you to know your answer. Where the part is and how 
long it was going to take to get it though and finish it up. But I like that, I liked that 
type of work.  
 
Did he keep checking up on you after that? 
 
No, no. No he didn’t. Hahahahaa. 
 
Were you ever laid off again after… 
 
Oh yes. I was laid off three times when I was at Boeing. 
 
Tell me about those times . 
 
I’ve been there two years, and got laid off in 82. I was laid off for about seven 
months. I came back for a month or a month and a half, was laid off again and I came 
back and I probably worked, oh, I am thinking maybe a year, and… let me think. I 
was intitally laid off after two years…. I was laid off for about seven months. I came 
back for about three months, got laid off. Then as I was coming home I was putting 
the key in the door and my phone was ringing. I go in and answer the phone and its 
Boeing. “Oh well, we are sorry, we shouldn’t have laid you off. We want you to come 
back.” SO, it was kind of… it was I was right on the edge where it just always 
teetered and I was always worried about getting laid off. So, yeah. Things like that 
happen. And then, you know, I mean they gave you no notice. You came in and they 
said today is your last day. So, now they have the… the um, oh gosh… they have to 
notify you. Give you a 60 day notice. You know, if they lay off 500 people or more. 
Then they have to give you a 60 day notice, and sorry I cant remember what that’s 
called. But um, which makes it better you can plan, OK, I am going  to get laid off in 
60 days, so I need to make sure that I have this bill paid and make sure that I am 
able to make it after that. So that was good.  
 
What did you do during those 7 months that you were laid off? 
 
Look for work, and that was hard back then. Because this was ’82, the bottom 
dropped out of the aircraft industry around town. No one was hiring. I mean, not 
just aviation. No one was hiring. So my girlfriend and I, she was laid off at the same 
time and we were in the same job, and we went out. Oh gosh. Three or four times a 
week at least, looking for work and everyone had on their doors, NOT TAKING 
APPLICATIONS. NOT HIRING. You know I bet, I kept a long because you know then 
you had to keep a log for unemployment, you know where you went. Maybe who 
you talked to. And I kept a log and I bet the seven months that we were off we went 
to 300 places. Close to 300 places and no one was hiring. So, you know, of course I 
had a husband, he was working at Cessna, so I wasn’t destitute. Things grew a little 
tighter, but it was fine though. But I made it through and I got back to work and I 
was… I have been pretty lucky. 
 
What was the most frustrating part about your job? Your work at Boeing. 
 
The most frustrating. The most frustrating probably would be uh, dealing with 
management when they… of course they felt pressure from up above them and 
especially when you had at Boeing, and I worked military, so um. When there was a 
big need and you had a particular item that the Air Force might need for their plane 
or something, because you know I worked on the KCs. And so they felt pressure and 
of course the pressure goes downhill, and they expect you to work miracles I think 
sometimes. But, sometimes you do feel like you are working miracles, HAHAHA. But 
that that was pretty frustrating. When you would get into a meeting it would be a 
high pressure meeting, and they would be bombarding you with ‘Why can’t we get 
this?’ or ‘Why is this taking so long?’ So there was a lot of pressure when I worked 
on the JSTARS program. I had two weekends off in a year. And that was like, um, 
Saturday and Sunday and I think a Sunday on the other week, I didn’t even have the 
whole weekend. That’s the kind, that was pretty high pressure then. You know, to 
get two weekends off in a year and you are working 10 hour days, and just eight on 
the weekends.  
 
You had a family, right? 
 
I was working at Boeing, my daughter was four years old when I started Cessna. And 
uh, then my husband had two daughters from a previous marriage, and um, we were 
married in ’81, and um, yeah, we more or less raised our daughters while we were 
working. 
 
How was that? Working and having kids and not having weekends off. 
 
Well you know, it really wasn’t… I’m not saying it wasn’t hard, but you adapted. 
That’s just the way it was, you adapted. You know? But it really wasn’t too bad. I 
would have enjoyed being home with the kids, but that don’t always work out, so 
you do what you have to do.  
 
What was the most rewarding or enjoyable part of your job? 
 
OH I think just the job itself, except the pressure at times. You went in and you didn’t 
do the same thing everyday, you know, you had specific things that you had to do, 
but each day could be different, but I enjoyed the job that I had, moving through the 
departments with the material, watching it being made. And then the guys you 
know, and the women that you came in contact with. Because you had to be a pretty 
good uh, PR person when you deal with all of these people, so, you know, it was 
difficult at times because some managers when we first went in, they didn’t like 
women in the workplace, they didn’t like women. So it was difficult, but once they 
knew that you were capapble and that you weren’t shirking your duties, you know. 
Because there were some women who would rely on men to help them. But, I 
always tried to do everything myself. You know, I wanted to prove myself. Of course, 
that come from me being from a large family. I had five brothers and seven sisters 
and you know, we were very competitive and you know, we just hahaha, I knew how 
to get along with the men and I could get along with the women. So really, I enjoyed 
that job. Just talking to the people, you know, because while you are waiting on this 
part to be made, youre having conversations with the people in the area, then you 
move on to another area, and a whole new set of dynamics, and a whole new set of 
people. And I just enjoyed that.  
 
Did you ever go on strike? 
 
Oh yes. Every time Boeing did, and Cessna. Hahahahaha. Yes I was a union steward 
for 28 years. And yeah, it could be difficult, but you learned to cut back, you learned 
to do without. You know, I did my laundry and hung it out instead of putting it in the 
dryer. You know, we cut back on the meals, what we had. You know, you went to a 
little simpler meal, you know. And I think you kind of grow with doing something 
like that. You grow as a person and you have more compassion for other people. 
 
How did you get involved in the union? 
 
Well it was when I first went to Cessna, that was the first union job that I had. And 
uh, I got to know the people and uh, I felt that their principles was something that, 
that I liked. And so, I just started going to the union meetings and I was elected 
steward, and I was steward four of the years that I was there at Cessna, and then I 
was laid off when I went to Boeing I became steward two years after becoming a 
member of Boeing and I was a steward up until the day that I retired.  
 
Did your feelings about the union change at all over your career? 
 
No, no, I don’t believe they changed any. They grew as things changed, of course 
your things change with your views and what is going on. But my feelings for the 
union hadn’t changed, I feel there is a need for a union that uh, the people need to 
band toghether to protect one another. And to have, make a decent living. You know, 
Boeing paid well, but your earned it. There was a lot of pressure at Boeing, 
everyone, I mean you had schedules to meet and if you didn’t meet the schedule 
then that was a problem. And so, it uh, I enjoyed my work at Boeing, but I earned 
every penny of it. Ive got a good retirement and I appreciated that, but I feel that 
people need to be strong, band together as one and try to make something positive 
out of maybe something negative that is going on.  
 
What happened, what was it like in 2007 when the commercial side split off? 
Obviously you stayed with Boeing. 
 
Mmmm. That was a very difficult time. Very difficult time. I had friends that were 
not offered a job, you know, do you know how that went down here? With the 
divestiture they kind of split, Oliver was the split, that was where the line was 
drawn. Everything west of Oliver was commercial, everything East of Oliver was 
military. Military remained Boeing, commercial went with Onyx and then Spirit, they 
call it Spirit. When those people went home that weekend, they didn’t know if they 
was going to have a job to come back to. Everybody was waiting for the DHL trucks 
at their house, because that is where you were going to get the notice that you 
weren’t coming back. I thought that was a very sad moment in the history of Boeing. 
That that type of thing would go on. And uh, I had very good friends that were not 
offered jobs. And, and uh, I felt very… … …. I don’t know if you would say guilty 
feeling, but I just had terrible feelings that here I was I had a job, and they didn’t. 
There was 2,000 people that got DHL letters at home on the weekend, saying sorry 
don’t come back to work Monday. I’ve known of a couple of them that didn’t get a 
letter, went into work and they said, Oh, what are you doing here? You don’t have a 
job. That’s difficult, especially husband and wife. Both of them didn’t have a job, they 
had been there at Boeing for 20 plus years. No explaination, just you don’t have a job 
anymore.  
 
Did you wait for the truck on that Saturday? 
 
No, because I was already military, so I knew that I wasn’t going to be a part of it. 
But you know, it was a sad day. I felt… I know I didn’t feel like those that were over 
there, but boy, the feelings that I had. I knew that it was compounded ten times 
more for them. And it just made me sick. I was just sick. I just couldn’t… I had 
butterflies in my stomach. It was just horrible. I just hated that to happen. I didn’t 
feel that that was the right way for Boeing to handle that. But, Boeing is looking for 
the bottom line, and they saved themselves a bunch of money because they had a lot 
of people hung up in that that were close to retirement, or that had 20 years in and 
were 40 years old. Where is your pension going to be? You don’t know really when 
you have a 20 year pension. That was it. And, so it was a very difficult for me and I 
could just only imagine was for those people that didn’t get a job and had to sit at 
home and wait for that kind of answer. I know that I would have been sick, and I was 
sick at the time, you know, I don’t think I was feeling near what they were feeling. It 
was a very, very sad time. For Boeing, I couldn’t believe that the company would do 
that kind of thing. You know, would leave their people in that kind of…. …. And now, 
well I think they are, the commercial side, I still have a lot of good friends on the 
commercial side, and you know, its just not what it used to be. And every day after 
that for five years they were, had that weight on their shoulders of somebody 
coming in and saying youre fired. Or, we no longer need you. Or whatever, it was 
just very, very hard time. Very hard time.  
 
Overall, how did you feel that Boeing treated its employees? 
 
Before the divestiture? 
 
I guess, and after. 
 
Well, you know, you always have difficult situations in a workplace, and there is 
always controversy with management and employees. For the most part you know, 
the old regime… there was good and there was bad. You know? If you were part of 
their clique, you got a little bit better treatment. You were listened to a little more, 
you know, if you weren’t you felt kind of like an outcast. Your opinion didn’t matter. 
It got better as it went on. But after the divestiture, it really took a nose dive. Not 
only on the commercial side, but also on the military side. The relations with 
management went down, you know, nobody trusted anyone, the trust was gone. You 
know? And it makes for hard times in the workplace, you know? Youre not wanting 
to maybe produce as much as you were before because you have this feeling that 
you don’t know if you can trust them, you don’t know if you are going to have a job. 
You know, it was always there. And the rumor was always there; Boeing military, its 
going to sell out. And this is going on ever since the divestiture. Then finally it 
happens, they didn’t sell out. But they sure sold the people out. You know, I don’t 
think… They know it is the bottom line. The dollars. Why they are getting rid of 
Wichita, because for the last several years, well, since the divestiture, the work has 
been diverted from Wichita to other sites, and uh, I felt along with a lot of people 
that, there was work for Wichita, but they were diverting it, they weren’t letting 
Wichita have work. They were trying to get rid of Wichita. And probably because of 
the union, because of the higher wages. They want to send it down to texas where 
there is no union. And uh…. My grandson is working in Texas now, and, heh, it is sad. 
You know, I think the whole country has taken a nosedive for the bottom line. The 
companies are seeing that they can get more done with less people, well not more 
done, the same amount of work done with less people. Well you know why? Because 
these people are afraid that theyre going to lose their jobs, so they are working to 
try and save their job. But they are working them to death, you know, the overtime, 
and you know, you don’t feel like you have the time with your family that, the 
quality time that you really want or need. You know, and I think that the country has 
taken this big nosedive, because of the bottom line. The manufacturers are making 
more money with less people and in Texas they don’t have to have benefits, they 
don’t have benefits. My grandson is working for eight bucks an hour, no benefits, 
working.. I mean he is a hard worker, and the company… its got to be making 
money, I mean its doing Boeing work. It is painting the aircraft and getting it ready 
to poaint, and those guys, that is hard work. And they have to wear resperators all 
the time. It could be physically demanding on them, and uh, you know, these 
companies are getting by with the lowest wages possible and no benefits. You know, 
no health care, not even a fraction. I mean, at least they could have health care. The 
emplpoyee could pay something on it, but I mean gosh. Help these guys out. You 
know, you are making good money, why not share it? And I think that is where the 
downfall of this country went, in aircraft and every other business. You had the 
people like Clyde Cessna, the people at Boeing, LearJet, Beech. You know, you had 
these people that started it from the ground up, started these companies, they knew 
what it took and they cared about the people. Most of them you seen on the floor. 
And we used to see people on the floor at Boeing. They would come by and say, “Hi 
how you doing today?” and always at Christmas they would come and shake your 
hand, “How ya doing? Merry Christmas!” Not anymore. It’s who cares. Make me the 
money. How much money can a CEO make? I mean really, millions of dollars. Yeah, 
sure. They deserve a good pay, but do they deserve $16, $20 million dollar salaries? 
Plus perks that are probably $10 million more. I don’t know. Where has the… where 
have people gone that really care about the worker? You know, that’s what I don’t 
understand. These corporations, these big companies are making good money, but 
they don’t want to pay and they don’t want to hep the employees out by giving them 
benefits, a healthcare program. Its just sad. I am glad that my time is over, but I see 
my kids, my grandkids and now great grandkids  are going… whats going to be there 
for them? I don’t know. My daughter worked at Cessna, and she got laid off, you 
know, and we tried to tell her long before, don’t go into aircraft. And she went to 
collage, but she didn’t finish and went into aircraft, and now she is laid off. She’s got 
a job now, but we sure didn’t want her in the aircraft. 
 
Your husband was in aircraft too? 
 
Oh yeah. Yeah he worked at Cessna for 42 years. 
 
When Boeing, in 2011, I don’t know if you had retired yet… when they announced 
that they would withdraw completely from Wichita, do you remember that day? 
 
Oh yeah. I was retired, but I still keep in close contact with a lot of my friends that 
work out there, and you know, it… it wasn’t a surprise, it was a shock, probably, to 
them. But it wasn’t a complete surprise because we had been looking for this for a 
long while. But, you still have that hope in the back of your mind that the company 
would realize that, you know, who built Boeing? You know? The people built Boeing, 
and Wichita has given  a lot to Boeing. And Boeing has given a lot to Wichita. But the 
people here have really given a lot to Boeing and all the aircraft industry around 
here. And for Boeing to pull out, um, I don’t know. I took it as a slap in the face. I 
think most people did.  A slap in the face, and thank you but Hey, we’re don’t with 
you. Good bye. Its hard for people to understand that. Because most the people out 
there, and this is generation after generation that as worked out there, I’ve known 
three generations, that has been out there at Boeing. And machinists that have 
passed on their trade to their son, and now their grandson, and all that is gone. We 
are loosing the ability as a country to be able to pickup and do things again, like your 
grandfather did. The trade. Trade is passed down to generation, and if we loose that, 
where are we going to be? Where are we? We are in a pretty bad spot right now as 
far as I’m concerned. It does not look very prosperous for the future if we cannot get 
something turned around in this country.  
 
What do you think it means for Wichita’s future then? That Boeing is leaving.  
 
Well, you know, Boeing has went down since the divestiture, there were more white 
collar workers out there than there were blue collar, you know. What they call 
hands on. They called us hands on. You know, uh, the white collar workers are the 
office people and what have you. Most of them were doing projects that didn’t even 
apply to Wichita, they were working on other projects for St. Louis, you know. They 
were working on other pojects that we weren’t even doing here in Wichita. But the 
head count, they were on our head count, so they kept saying that the ‘rap rate’ what 
they call the rap rate, the cost of producing an item was getting so high that they 
couldn’t afford to maintain the… Well, they knew, they knew how to get rid of 
Wichita, and uh, back out without too much reprecussions, I don’t think it is right. 
Most people out there don’t think it is right, but their hands are tied. You know, 
they’re going away and they cant do anything about it, and that’s the frustration. You 
know. Boeing right now is going through a difficult transition with Air Frorce One. 
Um, they cant find someone to do Air Force One, you know, I am talking about 
mechanics, They can’t find the people. They’ve went to Texas and uh, to work on Air 
Force One, you have to have a top security clearance, and from what I understand 
they cant find enough people to get this top security clearance, and to get a top 
security clearance you have to be clean. You cant have a bankruptcy, divorice comes 
into play, um, you know, your spouse comes into play. If your spouse has been in 
trouble, drunk driving, you know, anything. That is in there, that is in the report. I 
think they go back seven to 10 years, in your history, you know. And, from what I 
understand, they just cant find enough people, I think it is like, oh, 250 to 300 people 
to work Air Force One when it comes in, something like that. I don’t know exactly 
the correct number, but they just cant find it in Texas, they cant find them. So, I don’t 
know what they are going to do. I know the military is very upset with them, and 
you know, they don’t like that Boeing is pulling out of Wichita, but I guess that is in 
the future, I guess we’ll find out what happens there. 
 
Did you feel loyal to Boeing the whole time? 
 
Yes. Um, I did. Um,  my parents brought us up that, you know, a hard worker gets 
what they work for and that you should be loyal to your boss, you should be loyal to 
the company. There were times that I was dissatisfied, there were times when I was 
unhappy, there were times when I was furious over things that were happening.  
Mostly over the treatment of other people, that is mainly why I became a union 
steward, because I was an advocate for the people. If I saw an injustice I wanted to 
make it right. I wanted to make both parties happy, not just the one. I wanted to 
come to some sort of compromise that both parties could live with and maintain a 
good environment. So, yes, I felt loyal, you know, I did the very best that I could for 
the company, for my job. Because I was paid, and I was paid a good wage. So, to me, 
that’s part of it, you know, you are loyal to your employer. So yes, I felt very much 
loyal to Boeing. 
 
You said earlier that Wichita gave to Boeing and Boeing gave back to Wichita. How 
did Boeing give back to Wichita? 
 
Well, you know, in the community, I was also involved in several different 
organizations at Boeing, that the people at Boeing, I wouldn’t say Boeing itself, you 
know Boeing would match like your contribution to charities. You know a lot of 
times we would have a big push on charities and what have you and they would 
match what we would raise, and the people were always generous, the people that 
worked at Boeing were always generous in the community and we were matched. 
And they were a part of Wichita, you know, the upper management sat in on I don’t 
know what different organizations they were in, but I know that they sat as chair 
and they were active in the community. So, they gave back to the community. But uh, 
and that is what is so hard about why they are doing what they are doing, why they 
couldn’t keep Wichita going. Because they do have very good, knowledgable people 
out there at Boeing. Uh Seattle, uh, took over 200 of them to keep Seattle going when 
we started laying off, and they transferred to Seattle. Uh, they loaned them to seattle. 
Some of them are transferring and staying, the majority of them are coming back. 
But you know, they went to Seattle, Seattle always liked the work that the Boeing 
people did and was always appreciative of them sending people down to Seattle, so 
they have a good workforce at Boeing right here, so why they are doing it, I don’t 
know. My only thought is the bottom line, I think that’s what it is all about. 
 
Do you think it will, did I already ask you this? Do you think it will hurt the 
community when you are gone? 
 
You did. I haven’t really,… um, I think it is going to be a noticeable, its going to be 
noticed in the community that they are gone, because all these people that are now 
there are going to be without work, so they are going to have to go somewhere. The 
employment… Boeing…. I don’t know, they had somewhere around 3000 employed 
since the divestiture, so I don’t know how big of an impact 3000 people is going to 
be, it is going to be an impact, but to answer your question, I really don’t know. I 
think it will be noticeable, but I don’t know how noticeable that might be. 
 
What do you hope happens to the Boeing facility? 
 
Well I think they already have buyers in there looking at it, you know. My thoughts, 
probably Spirit may pick it up because they are looking to expand their lines and 
they have no more property to expand on. So, and Spirit does have some of the 
property on the east side of Oliver now. They have shops over there right now. So, 
my thought is, is probably that Spirit may expand their property and utilize it.  
 
Judy, any questions? 
 
(No, that was good) 
 
I think that is all unless there is something we didn’t talk about. 
 
No, I can’t really think of anything. 
 
(Film woman: I think you hit the nail on the head with the unions) 
 
I do too, it is a necessity, like I told a lot of people when I would go up and ask them 
to join. I would go up and talk to them and they would say, well what do I need the 
union for? And uh, you know, I would try to explain to them that it is better to be a 
part of something than to be out here by yourself, and there is so many times, you 
know when the non union people would come and ask me for help, and of course I 
would help them. You know, I mean, that is my responsibity, I wasn’t just there for 
the union people, I was there for everyone, but it is just nice to have those people in 
our group, you know. Paying their dues, and uh, they are getting represented 
whether they want it or not, they are represented. And when they come to us and 
ask is for help we are certainly there and we certainly help them. I have always done 
that. I have gotten a lot of people in the union doing that, showing them. And it is a 
brotherhood, and a sisterhood. Its people that you can go to and rely on, and the 
union does a lot of good for this community. A lot of good. I mean we are always out 
helping the elderly, paint, clean up their yards. It is just a big help. I wish that we 
could get more good publicity in the city, because we are out there and we do do a 
lot of good. There is down sides to every organization, but to me it is pulling 
together, trying to make it better for the whole, and that’s what I have always 
worked toward and that has always been my wishes and hopes that people could 
come together, even if they disagree, come together and have some type of medium 
to where youre both happy. You are not totally satisfied, but youre happy when you 
walk out of the room. And that is important: to make people feel that they are 
special, and theyre looked at as a whole, and we are all working for them. And I am 
still active in my union, you know after I retire. You know I still call them all the time 
and tell them hey, I am here. If you need anything call me, and they do. They do, they 
are good people, good people.  
 
What prompted your retirement? Were you just ready?  
 
Yes, I was just ready. My husband retired three years before I did. And, uh, I always 
told him, I am just not ready to retire yet. He is three years older than I am, so. And I 
told him I am just not ready to retire. I said, I will look at 62, you know, when 62 got 
there I wasn’t ready. I still felt like hey, you know, I got up and I went to work, I had 
no pains no aches, no problems, hey I am keeping on. And then one day I hit 63 and I 
woke up one morning and I said, you know, I have had enough. You know, I am 
ready, I am just ready to go, and this preceipitated the fact that they were still in 
their layoff mode, there were still people out there that needed jobs, you know, I 
was 63, I’ve got a good pension, why not leave it for the younger people, you know? 
Because I look at it like this, if I were 45, or 50, you know, and I saw somebody that 
was still working at 65, or 62, you know, it would be difficult to say, you know but 
there are, there are people out there… one man was in his late 80s still working and 
I thought, ‘Give it up!” You know, I thought enjoy your life. And he always said I do. 
And he enjoyed his work. To me, work is for the younger generation, Hhahaha. 
When I get retirement age, hey, I want to sit back and relax and just enjoy 
retirement. Let the younger people do the work. You know. Let them have the jobs, 
they need it. They’ve got families, children, wives, you know. Let them work. I am 
going home, hahaha.. So I enjoyed my years there. Sure, there are always highs and 
lows, but I’ve got a good pension and I had a good salary, but I earned the pension 
and I earned the salary.  You know, stress, there is a lot of stress out here in these 
factories that these people don’t understand. You know, every time we went on 
strike they called us greedy. You know, it wasn’t greed. You know, we were looking 
out for them. Did they not realize that? Did they not see that? Lot of them didn’t see 
it and didn’t want to see it. You go on a strike to make it better for the whole, the 
better wages, benefits. A lot of people say,’you are just pricing yourself out of a job.’ I 
don’t feel that way, you know. We as americans, the biggest industrialized nation in 
the world, these companies are billion dollar companies. They can afford to make it 
good for their employees and they should. They should feel a little shame what they 
are doing right now. All these companies popping up and they are hiring these 
young kids, like my grandson, he is 21. But he couldn’t find a job here, he went down 
to Texas because his father in law works down there at Bell Helicopter. So he is 
working in Texas, at an aircraft place to get a little background under his belt, get a 
few years, maybe try to get on at Bell Helicopter. But the jobs that they have, he is a 
young man with a wife and child. And the job that he does is a hard job, its hard 
work. I know the work, and I know it is hard, and he is not making anything an hour 
and he has no benefits, and that is a shame. You know, these companies should feel a 
little shame about what they are doing to the American people. You know, where are 
we going to wind up if we don’t start taking care of our employees? You know, and 
the people that started these companies, like I said you know, the beeches, Cessna, 
Boeing, Lear they were all once family people that started a business and that knew 
and wanted to take care of their employees, and then all of a sudden it started going 
to corporations and buyouts and nobody cares about the employees. Nobody cares 
whether you feed your kids or whether you clothe your kids, or whether you have 
money to care for them medically, you know. So, that is really sad, and I don’t know 
where we are going to come out. I hope we start making a turnabout and things start 
getting better, but I don’t know. You can just hope and pray and that’s all.
