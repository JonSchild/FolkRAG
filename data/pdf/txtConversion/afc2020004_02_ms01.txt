Thirteen Ways of Looking at an Indian 
 
 
1 
Among twenty Indians only one  
has skin as coppery as a penny 
and she sprayed it on. 
 
2 
If you’re a half-breed, 
you’re always of two minds 
but your heart is Red. 
 
3 
Coyote whirls in dust devils,  
grinning in the heart  
of our stories. 
 
4 
 A man and a woman  
(or a man and a man 
or a woman and a woman)  
are one. A human and Coyote  
are trouble.  
 
5 
I don’t know which I prefer: 
Native American, ndn, Indian. 
Skins or sly innuendos from Coyote 
as he saunters down the street, 
whistling, “Yo, mamacita, you bad honey!” 
 
6 
I grew up half white, but 
Coyote’s shadow is moody, dark-twin 
to mine. 
 
7 
O Non-Native—ndn—injuns! Why do you exterminate  
Coyote? Hang his pelt on barbed wire, string 
his ears on your belts? Do you not see how Coyote 
is part of this land, the dreaming and scheming  
of Thought into Existence? Without Coyote 
America would be a reservation of flat jokes 
and fizzled life.  
 
8 
I grew up in Southern California where rivers 
are cement troughs and Coyote sang from Hollywood Hills. 
My aunts wouldn’t say they were Yaqui 
because that meant death or slavery in Sonora. 
So they were Mexican with indigenous rhythm.  
 
9 
When the Conquistadors came 
or the priests or the Pilgrims 
or Walmart, we ran away. We ran in circles 
from death in one land to death in another,  
and Coyote was always there, holding our souls  
in the depths of his howl. 
 
10 
At the smell of smudged sage at the powwow, 
the white cop sniffed sharply, looking for some Indian  
smoking weed. 
 
11 
I tried riding in a canoe and almost tipped over. 
Horses scare me. My car has scars along its flanks 
from spatial misjudgments as I back out of the garage.  
My kind of Indian is self-defined. It’s whatever I do, 
however I do it. I’m not scared of who I am. 
 
12 
Fry bread is a recent tradition. Corn is older 
and part of my DNA. Corn is sacred, pollen flying 
into a world turned golden. Like Coyote’s fur. 
 
13 
Today lasted centuries. Coyote sits next to me, 
whispering promises of survival: mañana. It is tomorrow  
and will always be tomorrow. 
Stars shine all day, forever, and we don’t see them. 
Ours souls, whether white or ndn or Other, shine even longer. 
There are more than thirteen ways of seeing anyone.
