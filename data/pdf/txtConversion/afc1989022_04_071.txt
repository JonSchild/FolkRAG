I leave Logan for Salt Lake City at 7:20 a.m. 
Rendezvous 
with Tom Carter for coffee and bagels a little before 9 a.m. 
Since he is returning to Salt Lake City tomorrow, we have to 
drive separately. 
We pick up a few more odds and ends--notebooks 
for Tom and a second camera (of Tom's) for me. 
It's beginning to 
be the first hot day of the year. 
We arrive in Helper a little before noon. 
Parking my rental 
car, we take off in Tom's Land Rover to find a couple of high 
points from which to view and photograph Helper. 
"Nice back 
drops," as Tom says, and from any angle. 
It's an incredible 
moonscape--barren, rocky, stark, massive. 
Human habitation 
hardly appears "rooted"--just resting on the surface like an 
industrial site or a distant planet. 
Alien, but beautiful. 
From 
our perch on the south ridge, it's all the more dramatic. 
But 
Tom notes how bright the light is now at midday, and suggests we 
return in late afternoon light for better photos. 
We drive by the Verdi house in Helper and decide to come 
back and make contact after the lunch hour. 
We go to the Helper 
cemetery to eat our lunch. 
IAW-SS-F061890.A: 
[Helper Cemetery, Helper, Utah] 
After lunch, the gravestones attract us. 
It's not the best 
light, but Tom starts shooting anyway--we may not get back here. 
Several things stand out: 
1.) 
A carver who was active in the 1920s made beautiful, 
delicate doves, floral patterns, hearts, architectural 
motifs in amazing symmetry and in relief. 
His work is 
distinctive--clearly recognizable. 
Usually these 
y r 
stones are topped with a cross, which is a separate 
piece. 
He made stones for all the ethnic groups 
represented here - plenty for Italians. 
My guess is he 
wasn't Italian --Carol Edison may know who he was. 
If 
not, I'll pursue it further. 
IAW-SS-F061890.A -

2.) 
Tom notes that the ethnicities are apparently not 
segregated--we saw Slovenian, Hispanic, Anglo, Greek, 
as well as Italian markers. 
3:) 
The Lupo stone has photos of the couple in their youth 
V 
on one side and mature years on the other. 
Mrs. Lupo 
is photographed in the kitchen--with a pan in her 
hands! 
Mr. Lupo is pictured fishing. (He's living.) 
Lupo's was the best restaurant in Helper at one time. 
No longer operating. 
4.) 
One grave marked a murder from 1917--here is the 
inscription: 
Qui Giace 
Vittima Di Mano 
Assassina, 
Francesco Como 
Di 
Stefana E 
Antonia 
Nato a Reggio Ca-
labria it 10 Maggio 
1886. 
Morta it 10 Luglio 
1917 
I Desolati Genitori 
ed i fratelli pongono. 
5.) 
Older graves, in Italian, contain some widely variant 
spellings and forms of Italian words. 
We return to the Vier-di  house after the cemetery, but no one 
was there. 
Looking briefly at the landscape, though, it looked 
to be worth pursuing: bake oven, extensive garden, orchard, 
sur_rounded with trees. 
We tried the neighbors but no one was 
home.

IAW-SS -F061890.B: 
Next we head for the bungalows on Railroad Avenue [Helper, 
Utah]. 
But on the way, some serendipitous things happen which 
enliven this day's work. 
Tom spots a row of identical stone 
houses that he hadn 't seen before . We note them but go on to the 
bungalows . No longer inhabited , there is something depressing 
about them-- still interesting , but unappealing . We decide to go 
back to the row of stone houses (off Dodge street ) to see what we 
can find out--they might be more interesting to document. 
They are also uninhabited and the property is for sale. 
We 
talk with a couple of old guys who are chatting nearby, but they 
don't know anything about the houses. 
Then we spot a couple of 
ladies on a front porch and ask them about the houses. 
They 
remember that they had belonged to Joe Milano, who rented them 
ou_t. 
We talk a bit more . One of them, Ms. Politano, suggests we 
talk to John Bruno, who lives up the street . Tom decides to go 
phone Phil Notarianni and ask him to look up the historical 
society 's information on the houses while I go over to the 
Bruno 's. 
Tom will rendezvous with me at the Bruno's. 
Ms. 
Politano says, "Just go to the back door." 
I knock, and a deep, friendly voice says , "Come in!" 
(I am 
reminded of how open and trusting people are around here.) 
This is an introduction to a qsm—o.f -a couple a-nd an 
important family and site for this study ., 
I had already noted 
the neat yar 
•a 
s, an 
outbuilding with a chimney when 
I knocked on the door . Later, when Tom joins, we decide to ask 
permission to do a complete set of drawings of their site. 
It 
will replace the Verde house as a site which is more active, 
vital , ong 
n 
ing that's missing is a bake oven. 
I set up an interview with them for 10 a.m. Wednesday 
morning but we speak at length about his father (Jo-e Bruno) 
immigration, earlier residences and b 
C11
- ing of this house. 
John 
himself, was born in Domanico (sp?), Calabria in 1909. 
His 
family came in 1913. 
Yolanda, his wife was born in 1914, in 
Villanea(sp ?). 
She grew up in Green River.

ntil the late '60s, when he died. 
Mr. Bruno has a h.'d tim 
getting around--one artificial leg 
(mining accident--leg/sinned be ,
 
een two RR cars), one replaced 
hip, recent cataract surgery, re 
t prostate surgery! 
All that, 
and he looks great! 
So his wife gz , - us the house-shed-garden 
tour. 
Beautifully neat house, there are framed religious images in 
many rooms, esp. the bedrooms. 
In the 2 main floor bedrooms 
there are woven palm crosses from Palm Sunday. 
Mrs. Bruno 
explains that she hangs them for a year until they are replaced 
the following year. 
One is hanging in the shed, too, and her 
father-in-law used to place them on the Christmas tree (?). 
The basement is equally neat, also with framed religious 
images and two old family photos (See photo log #s 
.) 
Mrs. Bruno is preparing for her granddauqhter's wedding (in 
August), and she has already baked traditional cookies (m 
) 
which we sample, made of flour, oil, egg, and honey. 
She has a 
large tin, filled with them and a jar of water inside to keep 
them soft. 
Also she has confetti ('ordan almonds) wrapped in 
small packets •aIrea-dy --co•Tntecl=otit for each wedding -quest. 
Very 
traditional.) 
The shed was organized for making salami and other pork 
producl.5. 
Tum 
photographs it. 
T e 
raP 
rough for mixing the 
pigs' innards is still there. 
Underneath, in the cellar, are old 
wine barrels, hooks and poles suspended from the ceiling for 
hanging the  
salami, ham and sausage, crocks for lard, spigots, 
etc. 
Now used only to 
tsore 
a few apples. 
The garden is well documented by Tom's photos. 
Note its 
Italian character: 1- 1 
/2 
on 
rows of garlic, a long  
of fave  
("horse beans"), herbs 
(parsley 
s we
et•ds3T, oregano) a long row 
of hot peppers, tomatoes, zucchini. 
Also fruit trees--cherries, 
apples, (golden and red delicious) apricot, peach, plum, and 
according to Kerry Fister, the only walnut tree in Carbon County. 
The garden is huge--they give most of the stuff away--but it's 
been cut back from earlier times. 
Interestingly, I think, when 
they cut back, they didn't do it proportionately. 
They 
eliminated some of the less-specifically Italian crops--corn and 
carrots, for instance. 
The regional nature of the garden can be 
seen in the elaborate and careful irrigation system. 
They have 
personally extended the system, tracking their water after the 
garden to their family across street. 
Even though their 
IAW-SS -F061890.B - 
3 
relatives also have "water shares ," this is more convenient for 
them and it 's conserving the water. 
(In some areas of Carbon 
County, water-rationing has been in effect for 2 years and 
outside use is totally banned.). 
Tohn's father used to have a fig tree. 
Accord-ing-to Gambino 
(Blood of My Blood ) the_.fi_q _tree is  one of the most heartfelt 
indications of  
southern Italia_nness. 
The of -fort Joe Bruno made 
to care for this fig tree was way out of proportion to the number 
of figs produced , so it can only be understood in the way Gambino 
suggests. 
When it was small , he kept the fig in a pot and moved it to 
the cellar each winter. 
As it grew larger, he bent it over and 
packed it in various kinds of insulation each winter -- dirt, 
leaves, etc. 
He built a structure around it . But this is not 
the climate for figs! 
We talk quite a bit about the garden , and about hard times, 
and I hope to return to these topics with the interview. 
After the Bruno 's, I call Kerry Nick [Fister ]. 
It turns out 
that her sister Palmina had prepared lasagna for us, expecting us 
for dinner tonight. 
My miscommunication . But since she hadn't 
heard from us yet (it is already 5 p.m.) she hasn't baked it. 
We 
decide tomorrow 's dinner would be a good time to get together.

We drive back to

Shoot some 
photos of town layout form the south ridge, but it isn't a good 
view of the Bruno house. 
We can see where we want to be shooting 
from on the east ridge, and we spot the road that seems to go up 
there. 
We try several roads but they are blocked.

IAW-SS-F061890.D: 
Because of the long daylight hours, we figure there is still 
time to drive out to Columbia to check out the  
bunkhouse David 
Taylor had seen. 
It is stunning indeed. 
(See IAW-SS-B001-10.) 
We look around for awhile and get lucky. 
Arvetta Satterfield, 
the owner of most of it, who lives across the street in the 
building where meals were served, drives up, returning form 
Arizona. 
She remembers David and John's visit well and offers to 
organize an evening with several Italian residents so we can 
talk. 
She is very enthusiastic about us documenting the 
bunkhouse and chats at length about it. 
There are 18 units, it 
is  "double," 9 rooms o -each side. 
It was used until the 1960s 
when the steam plant down the hill wa, 
osed. 
It had provided 
hto 
aver 
or the communal 
bathhouse behind the building. 
There 
were Greeks and Italians living there. 
A "Japanese bunkhouse" 
also existed. 
We drive through East Carbon on our return. 
Here is today's 
mining town inhabited mostly by Mexican-American workers and 
widows of an earlier era. 
Nearby, Sunnyside is operating and 
this neatly ordered town of small (1940s?) housing--thin-walled 
frame housing seems lively though not prosperous. 
A late dinner in Price, and Tom makes calls to try to see 
the Manina house and Milano houses. 
We check in at the Comfort Inn in Wellington at 11 p.m.

Tuesday, June 19, 1990 
Tom has to return to Salt Lake City this morning. 
We 
evaluate and discuss plans over breakfast. 
Our idea is to come 
here again at the end of July/beginning of August with Tom's 
students and draw the houses. 
I will see if the Nick Sisters are 
willing to prepare us a meal and let us photograph their cooling. 
After Tom leaves, I begin making phone calls and writing up 
my field notes. 
I will meet the Nick Sisters at Palmina's 
[Palmina Nick New] for dinner at 4 p.m. (Josephine goes to work 
at 5 p.m.) I will see Guido Rachiele at his store a little before 
noon. 
IAW-SS-F061990.A: 
The recording situation with Guido is not the best, but 
anything else would seem to be an imposition. 
He is in his store 
7 days a week from early a.m. to 8 p.m. 
So he offers to let me 
interview him behind the cash register. 
It's a small "Mom and 
Pop" store, so the interruptions are mostly kids buying candy. 
The Checkerboard Market is the "modern" version of the store in 
which men in the neighborhood can sit and bullshit. 
In the 
corner near the cash register Guido has 4-5 chairs set aside and 
men are there, sitting and talking. 
It's an 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. 
type of thing, according to Guido. 
He calls it a "little League 
of Nations" or "melting pot" because two are LDS [Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter Day Saints], one a Spanish Basque (former mayor) 
and one a Greek, today. 
I meet them, and then we settle in for 
the interview. 
Guido give some leads: 
-Paul, Frances Mancini, 221 N. 1st East, Price. 
Tel: 0683 
His family may be from Sicily, and she may be from the 
North (Colli was maiden-name?). 
-Mary Delpha, P.O. Box 484, 357 East 100 North, Price. From 
Napoli? 
Lots of interruptions, I'm afraid. 
Guido is very friendly. 
IAW-SS-F061990.A -

All the kids coming in to buy candy, call him Guido and it rings 
with affection. 
Many people charge things. 
Guido is proud to be Italian and probably subscribes to the 
"prominenti" school of thought. 
He's proud of the educational 
achievements of his generation--sees this as the fulfillment of 
his parents' wishes. 
He shows me a certificate (signed by Lee 
Iacocca) attesting to his parents' immigration, gotten for a 
donation to the Ellis Island Foundation. 
(Later I made copies 
for this report.) 
I take some photos but need to return when the men are 
there. 
(See IAW-SS-B001-11-14.) 
After interviewing Guido, I call Al Veltri and arrange to 
interview him tomorrow at 1 p.m. (Brunos interview is at 10 a.m) 
I write up notes and plan to see the Nick sisters at 4 p.m.

Coworker: 
Site: 5 
IAW-SS-F061990.B: 
When I meet them [the Nick sisters] at Palmina's house, it 
is a real reunion with good, strong hugs. 
The table is set, the 
meal is ready, and the din and hubbub of voices and life is 
incredible. 
I'm struck once again by the female texture of their 
society/family. 
Besides myself, the only other males present are 
Phil [Fister] (Kerry's husband) a young coal miner who is the 
husband of one of the Palmina's granddaughters, and a great 
grandson--about 5-6 years old. 
But there are the 3 sisters, 2 of 
Palmina's daughters, 2 (?) granddaughters (one very pregnant), a 
great granddaughter, more? 
I have a hard time keeping everyone 
straight! 
The amazing thing is the way all these women of 
several generations seem to relate to each other in a very 
intimate, joking way. 
They're all sisters and all mothers and 
daughters. 
No distance between granddaughter and grandmother, 
none between niece and aunt, none between cousins. 
The men seem 
sort of superfluous, like drones! 
(I am treated royally.) 
We have to get to the meal because Josephine has to get to 
work at the Matador Restaurant at 5 p.m. 
It's a real gut-buster. 
esp. for 4:30 in the afternoon: 
Lasagna (not something their mother made) 
Ricotta ravioli (ricotta mixed with eggs, garlic, 
herbs, rolled in flour, boiled) 
Stuffed zucchini 
Candied yams 
flat beans 
tossed salad 
Garlic bread 
Meatballs 
Marinated olives (in oil, parsley, onion, pepper)

wine 
Italian cream cake (w/ice cream) 
coffee 
(See IAW-SS-0001-1-6) 
The dessert is served later. 
We chat a lot about family 
developments, recollections of their folks. 
Plan to get together 
again on Saturday at Kerry's, but Palmina invites me to drop by 
for lunch. 
Lots of gossip--but in the context of expressing a 
great deal of concern for each other. 
Problems of an 
LDS/Catholic intermarriage (Palmina's ist marriage) 
They also gave me a couple of leads: 
-Jeannie Annella, who lives near Josephine, "knows a 
lot of local history." 
-Warning that "Sonny" Fratto isn't well but that Ernie 
and Delores (daughter?) Etzel can tell me about him. 
Also suggested I go to Scofield to see cemetery with graves 
from big mine disaster. 
Back to motel from Palmina's about 8 pm to make calls and 
write journal notes. 
Tentative appointment with Mayor Colosimo

IAW-SS-F062090.A: 
My 1st impression upon arriving at the Bruno's in Helper is 
that something has gone wrong or they're having second thoughts. 
They don't seem as friendly. 
The other friends they hoped to 
have present aren't here and Yolanda warns me that they have to 
leave so we won't have much time. 
I had planned on using the 
Nagra but this makes me shift to the Sony. 
Shortly after we get started, though, they warm up. 
And we 
go for nearly two hours. 
It turns out that John has unexpectedly 
damaged his artificial leg since Monday and has to go to Salt 
Lake City this pm. 
So they're nervous about going and getting 
ready to go. 
Yolanda gets out several kinds of cookies and lets 
me photograph them and some objects in the house like religious 
images.

It's nearly straight from the Brunos to Al Veltri's 1 pm 
interview. 
He wants to show me a Who's Who of Italians in the 
West (?) 
from 1929, which lists prominenti from Helper. 
Then he 
remembers that his son has it. 
He calls his son an "ethnic 
buff"-- half Italian, half-Greek, he speaks Greek and is learning 
Italian. 
His name is Joe Veltri, lives in Salt Lake City, tel. 
262-8720. 
Works for Utah Power and Light. 
I will contact him 
because he makes his own wine and sausage. 
Later in the 
interview we drink a bottle of his wine. 
Al says they did a bad 
job that year, but I find it quite good. 
Veltri also gives me 
some additional leads: 
-John Labori, Parkdale Nursing Home (Price) a "real 
old, old-timer". 
-Frank Dalpiaz, acting President, Stella di America 
-Walter Borla, recording secretary, Stella di America. 
-Tony Priano, lives 2 doors away from Al Veltri, an 
immigrant, another "real old timer". 
Veltri also knows names and work of some of the stone 
masons: 
-Eugene Falsetti (from Abruzze), did the stonework on 
the dugway from Columbia to Sunnyside) 
-Bianco (from Piemonte) 
-Seppi 
These two did work on Labori house nearby and on nearby 
retaining wall which I photographed. 
See #s 
Al Veltri is very warm and relaxed, and it is a pleasant, 
lengthy interview. 
He is pretty sophisticated and worldly wise, 
being a graduate of USC. 
Al also confirms that Felice Giglotti did the store/hotel 
IAW-SS-F062090.B - 
2 
bldg, when you enter Helper from the north. 
His son, Ross 
Gigliotti (87) has the station next door. 
Al shows me the masonry wall not far from his house which I 
photograph. 
After I put away the recorder, I think Al mentions that 
"Carbon County Days" is celebrated by "expatriates" in San 
Francisco and Harbor City (LA) among Italians. 
The tape, unfortunately, is quite weak in signal. 
I now see 
that I didn't place the microphone well. 
1st use of the Nagra 
was not well done, though it is usable.

IAW-SS-F062090.D: 
on the way back down the canyon I spot a beautiful stone 
house and two other houses with stone retaining walls holding 
their front yards back from the road. 
(See IAW-SS-B0025-34; IAW-
SS-0003-12-20; IAW-SS-0004-1-7.) 
I stop and start photographing 
the stone walls when I hear a voice saying, "Getting some good 
shots?!" 
This turns out to be Bertha Elegante, a friendly and 
garrulous lady in her 80s who lives here. 
Her sister lives next 
door and her nephew in the old stone house -- "the first house in 
the canyon." 
We sit and chat in Bertha's yard. 
She is from 
Kansas -- half-French, half-Italian. 
She came here to marry one 
guy but ended up marrying another. 
Her sister and her married 
two brothers. 
She and her husband built the stone walls, but it 
was her father-in-law, "old man Elegante," who was a stone mason 
and who built the stone house. 
I should probably return to tape 
record her. 
We talk some with her sister, who is not as laughy as 
Bertha, but who thinks the stone work up the canyon was done by 
several Italians, including Gigliotti and Seppi. 
Bertha then 
tries to find some newspaper articles for me, but can't. 
I 
photograph the stone house and drive back to town where I 
photograph another stone house at the beginning of Canyon Road. 
Also shoot photos of "Fabrizio Street" with some interesting

Thursday, June 21, 1990 
I call Mayor Lou Colosimo this morning and we settle on 2 
p.m. as an interview time. 
I have some time to write since my 
appointment with Edna Romano isn't until 10 a.m. 
IAW-SS -F062190.A: 
Some themes are beginning to emerge . First , Helper is much 
more the Italian working -class, mining town than is Price. 
garound_ 
the -town 
-
-_
you- begin- to- Yearize that there is a 
Drivin
-ing_ 
_ 
praticular balance to the yards which is quite different. 
Outbuildings  like small shacks, converted _garages, often with 
- ----- ---- 
smoke  stacks , are bunched at the back or side of the yard, often 
by a fence . Some yards have 2 or 3 of these--and few have none. 
These were once used for making and 
-storinq  
sausage, wine, bread 
etc. 
They make a denser, more urban and intricate network on 
this oddly urban/rural industrial landscape.__ 
Second point is about the stone masonry . Apparently, 
Italian _- stone_masons.from both -the North and the South were 
called upon  not only to build ho-us-es-, stores_,_and boarding houses 
for private  entrepreneurs ; they a-]-so built the c 
d_ 
ompany-owne 
mining camps, including railroad beds, bridges ,_ hQusPs, 
foundations , buildings -- everything. 
It's all built of local 
sandstone -=tamer was  not plentiful. 
The volume -of the  
stone 
masonry in Helper and  
in the mining camps Ji e cnl•ia, 
Ken Tt -rth;_ -Hiawatha ,  
and Standardville is just astounding. 
When 
I-asked Al Veltrf about it he said , really innocently I think, 
"weren 't all those Italians stone masons ?" 
In other words, 
wasn 't it another of those many skills that all these men and 
women came equipped with? 
Wasn 't it ordinary , barely worthy of 
mention? Like whittling to E.H. 
I'm beginning to think of the stonework as a 
-metaphor Qf 
Italian ethnicity in the area today . The stonework is 
everywhere , underlying everything--a whole economy was built on 
it and it still provides the structure, literally the foundation 
for so much . 
(Frame houses in Kenilworth for instance, lie on 
older stonework foundations.) 
But, like Italian ethnicity today, 
you don 't see the stonework unless you train your eye to look for 
it. 
The longer I am around looking for it the more I see it 
everywhere . I think Italian ethnicity also is that way. 
It's 
IAW-SS-F062190.A - 
2 
not readily apparent with signs saying "look at this, it's 
Italian" or in obvious ways like language and song. 
But at the 
structural level, behavior, Italian--especially Southern Italian-
-values undergird the whole society. 
So far, the enduring 
Italianness is apparent in: 
-Stonework (historic) 
-Foodways (historic and present) 
-Matriarchal family (the Nicks) 
-Gardening (historic and present) 
-Gravemarkers (historic) 
-Card games (mainly historic, but still exists) 
-Stella d'America (mainly historic, but still exists) 
one fairly shocking bit of information from Al Veltri was 
that the Stella d'America lodge was strictly for North Italians, 
and it did not admit Southerners until 25 years ago! 
So the 
division of North/South was quite strong. 
It seems mainly to be 
a Piedmont/Calabria conflict as I've not yet found very many 
folks from other regions.

Informant/Event: Romano, Edna 
Coworker: 
Site: 5 
IAW-SS-F062190.B: 
Edna Romano was the first non-Calabrese I interviewed. 
She 
is Piemontese. 
She describes this conflict from the northern 
point of view and quite frankly. 
Her maiden name is Borla, and 
Louis Borla, her grandfather, was a stone mason. 
He was one of 
the masons of Standardville and also built stone houses. 
Some of 
his work is apparent on their farm below the golf course in 
Carbonville. 
Edna was a very pleasant person to interview. 
She works 
with low IQ children and adults and has a strong social 
conscience. 
Proud of the miner's struggle but horrified at what 
has become of their work today. 
She is active politically as a 
city council woman and is concerned about the locally 
deteriorating economy. 
She looks completely Northern Italian--
you could set her down there with no trouble! 
Edna brings out a book at one point called The Italian-
American Catalog (Joseph Giordano, Garden City, NY, Doubleday, 
1986). 
The title is an obvious borrowing from the Jewish 
catalogs--which focus more on religion than ethnicity. 
Edna also mentioned cemeteries which would have the most 
Italian graves--Spring Glen, Sunnyside, and Carbonville (besides 
Helper and Price). 
She also suggests more leads; from different Italian 
regions: 
-Sicilian: Chuck Ghiradelli (sp?)-Chuck's Pharmacy 
-Venetian: Albun Topolovich (Rosemary Lamoni). 
Edna's best 
friend. 
Spring Glen. 
-Toscano: Beulah Tabone (Helper); called "Toscano" as a 
nickname. 
The perfect LDS/Catholic marriage. 
-Steven Giacoletto, runs Workman's Store. 
Father may still 
sing. 
"Interesting family history." 
-Stanley Littizzette:- attorney in Helper (70), also 
interesting family history. 
"Comical." 
IAW-SS-F062190.B -

After Edna's I have about an hour before the appointment 
with Mayor Colosimo, so I head back out Canyon Road to see if I 
can find the lens cap I thought I'd lost when I was shooting the 
Elegante house the day before. 
While I am looking in the dirt, 
along comes Bertha in her car with one of the newspaper articles 
she had been trying to find. 
I follow her in to the bank in 
Helper where she gets a copy made for me. 
Now I have to hurry to make it to the mayor's on time. 
I 
get there just at 2 pm, but it is the wrong office. 
(Once before 
Tom and I had met the then-mayor at this municipal office.) 
By 
the time I get to his office - ten minutes later - he is gone. 
His secretary calls him at another place, and we set up a meeting 
for 10 a.m. the next day (Friday). 
Since the city library and dinosaur museum are next to the 
mayor's office, I take advantage of the chance to visit them. 
I 
am curious to see if the library has much in the way of holdings 
on Italians--it did not. 
And I am just curious to see the newly 
expanded museum--which was great.

IAW-SS-F062190.C: 
This seems to be a good time to try a "drop-in" interview, 
so I drive over to the Parkdale Nursing Home to visit John 
Labori, who had been recommended by Al Veltri. 
After explaining 
myself to the staff, I am taken to John Labori. 
He is very old, 
extremely hard of hearing, very frail - weighing, I'd guess, 90 
pounds. 
I explain what I am doing, but he says he doesn't feel 
up to it. 
I think it was just as well - it would have required a 
lot of shouting. 
The nursing staff ponders if there is someone else I can 
interview, then takes me to "Till' (Manelli) Davido [Austrian 
husband] who turns out to be a lovely interview subject. 
Her 
husband, Oscar is now blind, and I'm not clear on what his 
illness is. 
She just stays with him for long hours, it seems. 
At first, I thought he had Alzheimer's because he sat and said 
nothing until the very end of the interview. 
But then he was 
quite coherent. 
The interview was in his private room. 
When I ask about music, Til recalls storytelling. 
My mouth 
starts watering. 
Although she can't recall any stories or even 
kinds of stories (she was quite young), she suggests some leads 
on the storytelling that took place in their tight-knit little 
neighborhood called "townsite" in Helper: 
-Fred Nicastro's son: owns the Cabana in Salt Lake City. 
He 
was a storyteller. 
-Nicola Feichko (Fecchio?) wa a fantastic neighborhood 
storyteller. 
Ann Bonacci in Helper is his descendant -
may recall stories? 
-Mrs. John Vea, Spring Glen. 
Italian-born. 
Has 
demonstrated (with Til, others) at Salt Lake City Arts 
Festival (what festival?--ask Carol Edison). 
Made cheese. 
-Stella Giglotti (wife of Ross, the son of Felice, the 
stone mason) is Til's sister. 
Other stone masons Til mentioned (after tape ended?): 
-Joe Manelli (her stepfather). Southern. 
IAW-SS-F062190.0 - 
2 
-Dominic Putri. Southern. "A fantastic Artist--one of the 
best." 
-Joe Barzaga - Northerner. 
-John Bircarde: bachelor stone mason. 
Southerner. 
-Louis Seppi: built rock foundation of their garage. 
Til has a stone retaining wall on her property to retain 
soil (in Carbonville?) done by her step-father (Manelli) and 
Putri. 
(ask her sister how to get there.) 
Til has suffered a lot in her life. 
Father died of an 
accidental gunshot wound when she was little, her daughter died 
(suicide?), her husband is ill. 
She is a beautiful, delicate 
woman.

Coworker: 
Site: 5 
IAW-SS-F062190.D: 
I want to see Hiawatha, where the Nicks spent 10 years in a 
tent, so I drive up there after the interview. 
I photograph it 
fairly extensively. 
(See IAW-SS-B003; IAW-SS-B004-1-4; IAW-SS-
0004-8-20; IAW-SS-0005; IAW-SS-0006-1-9.) 
Once again, the amount of stonework is astounding. 
Besides 
the famous jail (by Felice Giqliotti, 1904) there are 
the major 
buil3ings of this 
 company town. 
One section of older houses has 
been destroyed, but the stone foundations still remain. 
There 
are many stone walls, built to hold back the earth, all over. 
Today Hiawatha is eerie because it has many houses, but only 
a few are occupied, and the mine is operating, but humans are 
rarely visible. 
Back to the motel late in the evening.

10 a.m.: 
Mayor Lou Colosimo is a big, friendly man. 
He 
doubts he'll be of much help but is willing to be interviewed 
anyway. 
He recommends someone I should interview: 
-Dominic "Dom" Besso: Besso Shoe store on Main Street 
(70s) . 
It is a pleasant interview, but I limit it to one side of 
one tape, feeling both the Mayor's time constraints and that he 
does not have a lot of the older Italian culture. 
I call Palmina Nick New who had invited me to lunch. 
I tell 
her I'll be there in an hour and meanwhile have a chance to see 
if there is an oral history collection in the CEU (College of 
Eastern Utah) library.

They may not 
be the best, but I'll list them: 
-Jim Piaciatelli, 859 North 500 East.

An LDS 
Italian - which might be a perspective worth pursuing. 
-Joseph Glorioso, works in Student Center 
-Magliocco, optometrist, 637-2414, 100 North 54 East.

I make a few photocopies of other items, though, and note 
the following materials in special collections: 
1.)

5.) 
Phil's article in The People of Utah. 
According to the 1930 census, there were 17,798 people in 
Carbon County, and 935 had been born in Italy.

coal mine employees.)

IAW-SS-F062290.D: 
From the library to lunch at Palmina's [Palmina Nick New] --
tuna fish sandwiches on white bread, chips, left over meatballs, 
soda, cucumber and tomato salad, marinated olives. 
Whew! 
Palmina is caring for a sick great grandson. 
A granddaughter is 
there for lunch and Palmina's daughter comes by later. 
I talk to older sister Mary on the phone, and then Josephine 
[Nick Copfer] joins us for a while. 
Kerry [Nick Fister] wanted 
to have us all over for breakfast on Saturday, but her kitchen is 
still being worked on. 
We talk to her, decide to breakfast at 
Josephine's, but drop by Kerry's to see the progress on the 
linoleum and carpet-laying. 
These details may seem inconsequential, but I think it is 
the constant involvement in the details of each other's lives 
that defines a Southern Italian, female-centered ethnicity which 
maintains the family today. 
It's a more-than-complete world of 
kinship which occupies all of them. 
Lots of family talk with Palmina, but we plan to do a group 
interview - the 3 sisters - tomorrow after breakfast. 
I tell her 
I plan to drop in on Dominic Besso this afternoon to see if he'd 
be a good interview subject, and she laughs, warning me to leave 
plenty of time. 
He's quite a talker. 
I say that's what I need!

We visit Kerry [Nick Fister] briefly. 
I am surprised to see 
that she is showing a visitor (wife of the man laying the 
linoleum) the short articles I had written on the Sisters for 
"Herstory", the woman's calendar a few years ago. 
These things 
matter more than we realize. 
I'm also struck by the not-so-good marriage of Kerry and 
Phil. 
Phil gets tired of all my attention to Kerry and the 
Italians and wants me to be interested in his ethnic background -
-the "Bohunks." 
He starts talking. 
He brings out a book that he 
loans me. 
Meanwhile, Kerry tells him I'm not interested. 
He 
gets mad. 
This theme emerges time and again. 
The other sisters' 
husbands have died, and, in a way, that's more "traditional." The 
husband in Southern Italy, is typically absent. 
Phil seems to be 
always in the way, a drone, extra, unnecessary, mostly ignored.

From Kerry's I go to "Dom" Besso's shoe store on Main 
Street. 
My intention is just to meet him and check him out for 
an interview next time. 
He's a wonderful, warm, and garrulous man. 
He talks about 
Italian immigrants being skilled craftsmen, his father being 
literate and people coming to'him to write letters and have their 
letters read, about his daughter, about being interviewed before. 
He clearly has an excellent memory. 
Customers come in and 
he gets them their shoes and boots, without tags, names or 
numbers. 
And the prices are incredibly low. 
The interchange 
very friendly and extensive. 
It almost seems like the shoe 
business is just an excuse to interact with people. 
One story I will have to have him retell is how his brother-
in-law (?) was spared from the big Castle Gate mine explosion of 
1924. 
He'd gotten drunk the night before and didn't make it to 
work that day.

IAW-SS-F062390.A: 
I drive to Josephine's [Josephine Nick Copfer] for a 9 a.m.

Amid lots of good natured teasing, I meet Jackie, 
Josephine's son (late 30s) and his 2 daughters. 
One is not quite

His wife is expecting. 
(This family goes on and on. 
Josephine's daughter Joanie is also present.) 
Palmina couldn't make it. 
Typically, she spent most of the 
night taking care of her granddaughter, attendant upon a birth 
that didn't quite happen yet. 
She took her granddaughter to the 
hospital but they sent her home at 2 a.m. 
So she wasn't ready 
for breakfast! 
Josephine, meanwhile, had taken a co-worker from 
the Matador to the hospital at 5:30 a.m. 
Then she made us 
breakfast - light, fluffy hotcakes, eggs, steak, coffee, 
cantaloupe, honeydew. 
Because Palmina couldn't come we decided 
to put off the interview to next visit.

Coworker:

IAW-SS-F062390.B: 
After breakfast, we went across the street to the original 
Nick homestead [Kerry Nick Fister, Josephine Nick Copfer and SS]. 
The house has had major modifications since I was last there--a 
huge 2-car and garage with a breezeway for starters. 
Inside, 
Kerry has added new cabinets, appliances, paneling, etc. 
Most of 
the material was scavenged second-hand from buildings in town. 
Recycling. 
Kerry takes great pride in her carpentry and other 
construction skills. 
In another combat with Phil, she complains 
that he does nothing while she slaves and does it all. 
Originally, their plan was to move into this house. 
But the city 
has delayed so long in putting in a sewer along the road that 
they have remodeled their old house instead. 
Now it's not clear 
what will become of this house. 
What is most interesting to me is how evocative for the 
Nicks this really this really nondescript, barren house and yard 
site is. 
It really looks like decay, and the barren hillside 
grows weeds and a few scrawny plants at best. 
But Josephine and 
Kerry seem to see the old, thriving household they grew up in. 
Josephine points to a lilac (barely recognizable lilac) and 
exclaims, "Look, Mom's lilacs!" 
She says the same of some 
flowers I would not have noticed. 
They recall the barn, the bake 
oven, the chickens, and so forth, with the enthusiasm of actually 
seeing them there. 
That's what they see in contrast to the 
barren landscape I see. 
I leave the Nicks and make several stops on the way home.

This is a small, rocky,

Spring Glen is one of the oldest (the oldest?) town in 
Carbon County and this is mainly an LDS (Church of Jesus Christ

But before Helper had its 
cemetery, Italians were buried here. 
(See IAW-SS-B004-31-35;

He seems to say 
ok. 
His gas station business seems to have been destroyed by the

IAW-SS-F062390.G: 
Kerry [Nick Fister] had suggested that Scofield - some 17 
miles off the road to Salt Lake City - would provide an 
interesting cemetery because of all the miners (200?) killed in 
the disaster there in 1901. 
So I drive to Scofield, but there 
are hardly any Italian graves - mainly Finnish and British Isles. 
To what extent were mining camps multi-ethnic? 
Or were they 
dominated by particular ethnicities in certain camps? 
(See IAW-
SS-B005-23-25; IAW-SS-000*-* ... ) 
The look of the town is different, too - no stonework, for 
instance, and the outbuildings are saunas rather than sausage-
making sheds. 
It doesn't have the density of a Helper. 
Since 
its become a sort of local resort town now (a big reservoir is 
right next door), some of this may be due to post-mining camp 
days "beautification" and restructuring. 
However, if there had 
been stonework, I think it would still be standing. 
Finally, on to Salt Lake City where I rendezvous with my 
son, Dov, who has astounded me by riding his bike from Logan to 
Salt Lake City (90 miles) today in 100 degree heat. 
The bike 
goes in the car, we visit a comic book store and head for Logan, 
arriving at 8:30 p.m. 
A good week.

Phil and his

They have just come from the Helper cemetery and they 
were also puzzled by the Italian of the gravemarker that begins 
"Qui giace...."

IAW-SS-F080190.B: 
I was beginning to think the majority of the Italians in 
Carbon County came from Piemonte and Calabria. 
I have since 
looked at the Italians described in Italian Activities of the  
Inter-Mountain Region (1930?, in Italian) which Dave Taylor sent 
and am surprised at the regional Italian diversity of the 
"prominenti" of 1932. 
In one interview I learned that many 
Italians left Utah for California during the Depression, perhaps 
removing some of the regional diversity. 
Of course, it may not 
be surprising that the Northerners are more numerous in this 
publication--which does not reflect the Italian population 
proportionately. 
People probably paid to be listed. 
But there 
are folks from all Northern regions, plus Abruzzi, etc. 
It would 
be interesting to know the actual regional proportions of 
original setters and how that has changed over time.

We go to a 1 p.m. appointment with Vito and Filomena 
Bonacci, Phil's good friends, in Spring Glen. 
On the way, we 
stop at the state liquor store in Helper to get some wine. 
The 
woman working there provides some more information. 
I ask her if 
the Italians here buy certain wines--she says, "Only two: Paesano 
and Pastoso [sp? Greek?]." 
She tells me "Blackie" Saccomano 
still makes wine. (That's Frank's brother.) 
Also there's a 
Colombo who may make wine. 
This woman's name is Michelle 
(Pugliese) Lee. 
Her mother is Betty Tamietti, and her mother is 
the regular clerk at the liquor store, and she would be the 
better contact, according to Michelle. 
Michelle says they are 
"LDS Italians." 
Michelle also mentions that a film on Helper 
made in 1932 has been circulating around town lately. 
It was a 
promotional film. 
Rudy Rebol (472-5962) is the contact to get a 
copy.

IAW-SS-F080190.D: 
We go on to the Bonacci's. 
The genuine affection between 
Phil and them is obvious, and they welcome me into their home 
with no barriers at all. 
Filomena is preparing a mid-day dinner 
for us, so we chat quite a while with Vito while also 
photographing them and the house. 
This conversation goes 
unrecorded. 
One thing I noted, though, was that Felice Gigliotti 
(.from San Bernardo [in Calabr-IL - 
also built the railroad-bridge 
between Helper and--H—law
-atha on the Utah Rai..l_way. 
Vito thought 
Gigliotti might have built the houses for Joe Milano--thought 
Nfi ano was not 
a 
mason. -: 
Vito also mentioned that he had been asked to participate 
with the union and other old miners in the Labor Day celebration 
in Helper. 
Parade? 
Might be worth returning for. 
Vito also talked about his home. 
It was moved from 
Sunnyside (in four parts) during the Depression, when the mines 
were working only a few days a month. 
They had been the bosses' 
houses--the best houses. 
Bought for $125. 
We shot a lot of photos of him talking because of his 
expressive gestures and the warm, almost tactile interaction 
between he and Maria. 
I found it wonderful to work with Phil and 
Maria--not only because of their skill and ease, but because 
working with other interviewers present, I could attend to the 
machines, take notes, not have to always maintain eye contact and 
conversation. 
I even had time to think about what was best to 
do! 
Also, Phil and Maria have excellent, natural rapport with 
the Bonaccis. 
The meal was excellent, of course. 
Spaghetti with tomato 
sauce (with little pieces of sausage), salad, fried chicken, meat 
balls, grated cheese, water, wine (brought by Phil), rolls, 
fruit, and home-made strudel (by an "Austrian" friend) and coffee 
for desert. 
Vito says he doesn't like spaghetti much any more. 
Filomena doesn't like it without cheese on top. 
I ask what 
proportion of their meals are Italian. 
Filomena laughs: 
"Everything, I think!" 
Vito says he likes macaroni and cheese. 
Filomena says, "That's American." 
Well, yes and no. 
She doesn't 
IAW-SS-F080190.D -

drink wine. 
He drinks just a little. 
After the meal, we get around to the tape-recording. 
Again, 
its good to have others helping in this process; I'm able to pay 
more attention to the Nagra. 
Vito tells his story at great 
length with little prompting. 
Later, Filomena joins in and 
contributes, but she is more reticent, less habituated, it seems, 
to talking solo at great length like Vito is. 
Before we leave, there's a quick tour of the garden. 
(See 
photos.) 
Vito and Filomena didn't plant this year because they 
knew there'd be no water. They do have a couple of rows of corn 
and volunteer squash, zucchini, and tomatoes. 
Nice basil. 
Garden space is small, but neat and a neat irrigation system. 
Phil goes off with Maria to visit someone else, while I 
return to the motel to wait for Tom, consolidate plans, and re-
familiarize myself with my equipment. 
It's about 6:30 p.m.

That's what he told Tom 6 weeks ago. 
Tom arrives about 11 p.m. 
We talk for a long time and 
finally go to sleep. 
Oh, I forgot. 
After I got back, I went to the nearby 
grocery to get some beer and I ran into Palmina's daughter, 
Jackie, who is now working there. 
She says the sisters won't be 
back until Saturday night so our Saturday plan may not work out. 
Tom and I try to restructure our plan based on that and the 
Manina/Winklereid problem. 
I'm reluctant to contact my other

After breakfast, Tom and I go over to it to contact 
whoever lives in the trailer in front of it. 
It turns out to LaVange McNeil, who Tom christens "The 
Oldest Lady in the World." 
She's very kind and helpful, but in 
very bad shape--hard for her to walk, hear, even breathe. 
She's only lived there for eight years, and doesn't know 
anything about the home. 
She does have a key to the bottom 
level, which she uses for storage, and lets us in. 
We scout the 
out-buildings--these folks were really into animals!--chickens, 
rabbits, and some larger stock--goats? pigs? cattle?

its the pressure of the upcoming wedding.

He 
advises us to question the Bonacci 's about the Manina House, 
especially how the outbuildings were used. 
The Bonacci 's are warm and open as ever. 
This time I use 
the Sony and get started with the tape right away . All five of 
us sit around the living room and talk about the Manina House 
before we view the videotape. 
The most important thing may be 
the discovery that someone who grew up right next to the house, 
Margarit (Marzio ) Ariati, now lives in Spring Glen. 
I will try 
to interview her tomorrow. 
I thought maybe recording while we played the videotape 
would be a great capturing of emotion, but it didn 't really work. 
They were so focused on the videotape that little was said. 
It 
was very moving to see the communication from the old country to 
the new. 
Vito 's relatives --Vincenzo and Marietta--were 
incredibly warm and sincere even through this artificial medium. 
Filomena shed tears quietly. 
Phil mentions Michele Pane, a well -known Calabrian poet. 
It 
turns out Filomena and Vito have read all his works. 
We continued to talk at great length , also having coffee and 
cookies. 
Afterwards we walked around the garden where I shot a few 
photos. 
Esecial_ y interesting is the way Vito has remade 
America•rshovels into an Ita Ian 
ype of hoe, a "zampone." (See

I leave the Bonaccis and Notariannis about 7:30 p.m. to 
return to the motel . Tom, Susan , Bee, and I exchange stories and 
info on Manina home and experience . Out for a late dinner at the 
Greek Streak and to sleep even later.

We look things over and then leave for the Brunos, the main 
item of the day. 
Tom, Susan, and Bee go to get something, and I 
arrive first and chat with the Brunos for awhile. 
John 's sister, 
who lives next door , is there as is Guy his brother (80), 
visiting from the Bronx . The occasion is the wedding of John and 
Yolanda's granddaughter in Salt Lake City on Sunday . Yolanda was 
a• 
in the middle of baking frazzini for the wedding, and I was able 
to photograph part of the baking . As the first batch came out, 
we were all invited to test them. 
A very Italian moment! 
I photograph Tom's architect team at work . Guy, from the 
Bronx, is just as enthusiastic about the garden--as if it were 
his own . His visit is, in fact , an extended one--about a month. 
Yesterday they harvested the oregano (see photos ). 
And they 
harvested the garlic (see photos) a while earlier. 
Both are 
drying in "the shack "-- indications that although food processing 
isn't as extensive as it once was, it still is important. The 
garlic and oregano is far more than they 'll use, and it is to be 
shared with neighbors. 
Tom later mentions what he calls the "scorched earth policy" 
of their garden . There 's really no weeds, and the harvested 
areas are reduced to dirt as well. 
Guy points to an area that is 
no longer planted and tells us that it's been "sterilized" and 
nothing will grow there for seven years . (Watch that seven!) 
I 
ask why he did that. 
It's because the weeds growing there would 
seed the rest of the garden with weeds . But the "weedless look" 
seems to be valued in and of itself , as well. 
Later on, Tom and I notice an image of Mary, the Blessed 
Mother, in the shack , which we photograph . It has a frame 
decorated with sea shells . Yolanda tells us its very old and was 
hung there by John's mother . She thinks it came from Italy.

Coworker:

IAW-SS-F080390.D: 
I leave about noon to try to track down more information on 
the Manina house. 
I drive to Spring Glen to drop in on Mrs. 
Ariotti. 
According to the Bonacci's, she grew up next to the 
Manina House--her name was Marzo and was one of the four children 
raised by the men. 
She's very friendly and open, and she and her 
husband would make another fine total interview. 
But I don't 
have time for that now and just take some notes. 
It turns out that she doesn't remember a lot, having been 
only a small child when she lived there. 
Virginio Marzo was her 
father. 
Her mother died when she was five. (According to the 
Bonacci's, she ran off with another man.) 
Dominic Conca was his 
cousin. 
Conca and John Manina "batched" together, and when 
Marzo's wife died/left, he joined them. 
Cavallo Manina came 
later, built the bottom part of the house first, the top part 
later. 
He only lived downstairs, and rented the upstairs. 
All 
the men were from Novalese or nearby (Province of Torino--but in 
mountains). 
Manina was a stonemason. 
He had a pig pen. 
Their home (the Ariotti's) is beautiful in an old way. 
Mr. 
Ariotti built it himself. 
(He's from "Lezegno" [sp?], near 
Novalese, too.) 
His mother and father went back and forth 
between the U.S. and Italy four or five times. 
The father liked 
Italy when he was in the USA, and the USA when he was in Italy. 
Finally, the mother said she was staying put--she was in the USA 
then. 
So the father went back to Italy for awhile. 
Then he 
decided to come back. 
But World War Two intervened. 
His kids 
finally brought him back, long after the war. 
The mother and 
father never got back together, though. 
Mr. Ariotti races homing pigeons. 
His loft is incredible--
neat, large, painted red and white. 
He is not very well. 
He has 
two hip replacements--the results of a lifetime in the mines. 
Their place is beautifully landscaped. 
There's a neatly-shaped, 
stone outbuilding. 
Mrs. Ariotti recommends I visit Teresa (Fazio) Ori, who she 
says actually lived upstairs in the Manina House in the 1930s.

Unfortunately, there aren't. 
I go to the R and A Market, which

He owns a bar/restaurant in town. 
He found a hidden room with a still in the basement of his

Also a claim that there 
are big caverns under the road. 
He's "a good talker." 
-Tofee Gazel--spelling? 
A source of stories about 
stills, wine, prohibition. 
-Betty can't remember the woman's name, but there was 
"a colored lady" named "Babe" who ran a "cathouse" in Helper for 
52 years--until just 7 years ago. 
She lives in Salt Lake City. 
There were, and still are, a few black families in Helper.

I record my brief interview 
with her, but also noted some important points in my notebook: 
-She and her sister had a double wedding in 1936. 
She and 
her husband rented the upper level of the Manina House, her 
sister and husband the bottom. 
Manina had just moved out. 
But 
he hadn't used the upstairs except for storage. 
She only lived 
there for one year, at $10 per month rent. 
-She says the garden was where the trailer is now. 
-She says there was a door between the two upstairs rooms. 
It was a kitchen and a bedroom (like downstairs). 
-Winklereid would know a lot as he handled the estate, but 
he has an unfriendly reputation. 
-She says that Camillo Manina was not home much of the time. 
As a stone mason, he was somewhat itinerant.

I go back to Price, and about noon my family arrives. 
I 
spend the rest of the day with them, and we do, at Palmina's 
insistence, have an incredible dinner at seven that evening, 
anyway. 
They insist on the dinner because Ona is leaving the 
next day, and Kerry will be gone Sunday, too. 
So at Kerry's 
house, but mainly with Palmina's cooking, we eat: 
-ravioli (homemade) 
-garlic bread 
-candied yams 
-salad 
-marinated olives 
-stewed meat from the tomato sauce 
-breaded chicken cutlets 
-lemonade 
-wine (Tom brought this) 
-green beans with bacon 
-chocolate cake 
-apple pie 
Except for the ravioli, which had been made in advance and 
frozen, everything was done this afternoon, after the exhausting 
return from Seattle. 
We have a really good time talking and leave about ten p.m. 
Before I leave, I take Gidi (my two-year-old son) for a walk to 
the Matador restaurant where Josephine, one of the Nick sisters, 
is working. 
Again, I can't overemphasize how hardworking these 
folks are. 
Josephine got back from a 28-hour train ride and went 
to work the same evening. 
It is almost 100 degrees out and she 
is cooking over a hot grill and stove. 
It is nine p.m. and a 
party of twenty has just come in. 
She's 67.

She is completely warm, open, and trusting and welcomes 
me into her home. 
Word has spread about our project in town, and 
it seems that the image of what we're doing is positive. 
She 
takes care of a handicapped brother--who appears only briefly and 
shyly. 
She is 75. 
The interview and photography lasts until 
nearly 1:30 p.m. as she likes to chat.

Next I go (directly!) to Rich Colombo's for a 1:30 p.m. 
appointment to see him make sausage. 
He is the nicest guy of 
all. 
I only hope what I shot comes out. 
A video camera would 
have been more appropriate. 
I left the tape recorder running 
most of the time, but there was lots of noise, lots of movement 
(away from the microphone) and lots of interruptions. 
The 
photography was even "higher risk"--I used the new 3200 ASA B/W 
film. 
I did this because the mix of tungsten and florescent 
lighting made me unsure of color and because the low amount of 
light (but constant movement) meant I needed high speed film. 
I 
should have used a flash, but maybe this will work. 
A very 
comfortable time working with Rich--he was helpful and very 
interested in the project. 
He invites me to come back at 6:00 p.m. to visit his uncle 
Charlie Saccomono and see Charlie's farm. 
Rich says I'll be 
amazed. Charlie is his godfather. 
Charlie has made his living 
mainly as a farmer, as did his father.

It's past 3:30 p.m. by now, but I have some time before 6:00 
p.m. 
I go to Castle Gate to find the cemetery. 
The town is 
completely gone. 
The coal company moved everyone's houses to 
Helper (Castle Gate subdivision) when they wanted to mine right 
there. 
The cemetery is pretty neglected and very desert-like--
like the cemetery in Spring Glen. 
Desolate--shouldn't a cemetery 
be like this? 
I find some gravemarkers in Italian and photograph 
them. 
One curious one (also see slides):

I rush to make it to Rich Colombo's store as he is closing. 
He has a red 1978 Fiat sports car that he's very proud of. 
He 
shows it to me, saying "Shouldn't every Italian own a Fiat?" 
We 
go to Charlie Saccomano's in his car. 
Again, I used a technical strategy that may not have worked; 
the video camera would have been better. 
We walked together 
through the farm--me with the tape recorder going and shooting 
pictures on the way. 
I would like to bring the architecture crew back again to do 
the Saccomono place. 
It has the following elements which have 
been missing in our work thus far: 
-It's a working farm (on a small scale--a "truck" farm, 
although I don't encounter that terminology here). 
Charlie 
raises pigs (for sale), rabbits, chickens, and a huge garden. 
Orchards and alfalfa as well. 
(See photos.) 
-The historic part of the farm has "everything": 
*The log house of the original settler (lived in by 
Charlie's father who bought it in the late 19th 
century). 
*The first house (stucco) built by the Saccomanos. 
*The second house (duplex, 2-level, like Manina?) built 
by the two Saccomano families and shared. 
J 
*Bake oven. 
*The wagon used for fruit peddling. 
*Boxes built to fit this wagon (the original "4 X 4"--
four boxes by four 4 boxes filled it precisely.) 
*The first truck they peddled produce with. 
IAW-SS-F080690.D - 
2 
*A rig for hanging slaughtered pigs. 
*Outdoor stone kitchen. 
*Smokehouse. 
*Stone chicken coop. 
*Rabbit hutches. 
*Sheep pen. 
*Huge hay barn. 
*"Hot boxes" for starting vegetables early. 
*Well. 
*Stable. 
*Etc.! 
I photographed and recorded information, but the conditions were 
difficult, so it may be worth coming back here. 
Rich brings me back to my car in Helper after showing me the 
extent of the original land. 
It was 188 acres. 
There is some 
bitterness because Charles got only 13 acres, his vounaer brother 
all the rest. 
(In Italy, oldest sons received everything.) 
Rich 
is also a volunteer fireman and EMT; he seems to be a real key 
community person. 
I get back exhausted at 9:00 p.m. 
I call Tom Carter about 
Saccomano and write up notes for awhile.

IAW-SS-F080790.A: 
Up at 6:30 a.m. to write in this journal and prepare for a 
Nick Sisters interview (and breakfast) at 8:30 a.m. 
I arrive at Kerry Nick Fister's to be overwhelmed by food 
(of course). 
A breakfast of hotcakes, waffles, bacon, sausage 
(not Italian), ham, scrambled eggs, coffee, orange juice. 
Cholesterol heaven! 
Josephine assures that they won't tell on me 
for eating pork! 
I say it's a deal! 
When the three sisters are together, it's pretty hard to get 
a word in edgewise! 
So over breakfast, I observe their intense 
communication. 
After breakfast, I record Kerry on the Nagra. 
Josephine and 
Palmina don't join in that much, deferring to Kerry as the older 
one. 
I solicit many of the same stories I got in 1983. 
But 
something is missing without Mary present. 
She was the oldest, 
of course, and was the most respected source. 
Still, Kerry is a 
rhetorician in her own right. 
Josephine and Palmina have to leave part way through the 
interview. 
I go on with Kerry for quite a while. 
Afterwards, I 
photograph some saints' images around her home, recording some 
information about them as well.

I had photographed it on the 
last trip as a pastoral place with only the stonework remaining--
see IAW-SS-CO01 -11 to IAW-SS-0003 -11. 
The same wall I shot 
several photos of appears in these historic photos with a 
railroad that is completely gone . Above the wall there were 
dozens of houses which are also completely gone now, in my 
photos . The change is incredible. 
Would these be of interest for the project? 
They are 
available from Greg 's Photography in Helper (801-472-5179). 
There is also a nice photomural of Frank and Teresa Mangone, 
dated November 10, 1913, entitled "Papa's First Payday, " showing 
him handing his check over to this wife . There is also a photo 
of the three Mangone children . Both are "courtesy of Leah M. 
Haslam." 
I also finally get to see the "famous " video of Helper in 
1939 . It's fascinating . I order a copy at Sunshine Video--to be 
picked-up on my next trip. 
By now it's 4:00 p.m. 
I head for home, arriving about 8:00

I

They are frying breaded chicken breast 
filets and making huge vats of tomato sauce with meat for 
spaghetti and lasagna. 
There is lots of talk and, of course, an 
improvised but delicious lunch: 
a sample of the chicken, tomato 
with minced garlic, spices, olive oil, cheese, baked beans--and 
ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert. 
Whew.

Quite the small town high school 
parade at noon--band, cheerleaders, class officers, all on cars,

The sidewalks are lined with kids and 
people hanging-out. 
1 A really interesting contrast here between Carbon County 
which is multi-ethnic, industrial (mining and railroads), 
Democrat, Catholic and Greek Orthodox vs. Emery County, which is 
English and Scandinavian, farming and ranching, Republican, and

He says he 
and Walter Borla, the secretary of Stella had just been talking 
about me last night. 
He invites me to the Columbus Day dinner, a 
week from Monday, but I say I probably can't make it. 
By 
evening, I already can't recall much of Dom's rapid-fire

caught up on the news.

From Dominick Besso 's, I go to Spring Glen for my 2:30 p.m. 
interview with Rose 
ea.  She turns out to be_an__incredible find. 
When I mentioned to Frank Dalpiaz at Dom Besso 's where I was 
going, he seemed to not think much of it , saying that Rose was 
from Canada and hadn 't been here very long . When I talked to 
her, I found out that "not very long" is since 1950. 
I think in 
Frank 's eyes, not being part of the 1890-1920 immigration makes 
her a newcomer. 
Rose 's daughter , Francis Fillingham , takes part in the 
interview , too. 
We sit in the kitchen of Rose 's house. 
The 
house lies on her husband 's family farm at the end of a road in 
Spring Glen . Around the house are the trailer and houses of all 
this family 's children (five ) except one who is in the adjoining 
town (Carbonville ). 
It makes the area a sort of family compound-
-and it felt that way with children and grandchildren constantly 
coming and going. 
Rose left Italy at 26 years of age ;n 1947 
so this 
interview is 
 
mixture of  Italian and English. 
Her daughter 
understands Italian too, making this the "most Italian" of 
families I've met.

Litizzette is Piemontese. 
He

Garibaldi in 
the South tries to figure out if his followers are Southerners or 
Northerners by asking how they say "two fried eggs." 
The 
Southerners answer in "Italian" the Northerners in Piemontese 
dialect!

Up this morning to breakfast at the Greenwell and then an 
interview with Dominick Besso at 10:30 a.m. 
He is probably the most garrulous person in the world! 
I 
bring my tape recorder into his shop where he came to try to 
catch up on his work. 
Before I can begin, he takes me to the 
side to show me some old photos and books. 
The tangential 
conversation (monologue!) lasts one hour before I finally get him 
to sit down near the recorder. 
The interview itself lasts for three more hours and wanders 
quite a bit. 
He talks so steadily that it is hard to direct or 
redirect the conversation. 
But there are many good parts, 
especially at the end where I asked him about what was satisfying 
to him in the shoe-repair business. 
Here he articulates what he 
calls being a perfectionist--and some of what he said is not on 
tape because he got up very animatedly and showed me examples of 
the kind of extra work he does to make shoes look good and work 
well. 
His shoe repair seemed almost like sculpture to me. 
Dominick gets a call and has to leave about three p.m. 
I 
plan to return tomorrow to photograph his hammer, photos, and 
other things.

Monday, October 8, 1990 
(Columbus Day) 
IAW-SS-F100890.A: 
Up and back to Dom Besso's between 8:30 and 9:00 a.m. 
I 
photograph the tools and his old photos and then take a newspaper 
article to get it photocopied. 
When I return, I shoot a roll of 
film of his shop and Dominick at work. 
As usual, it's hard to 
get away, but I finally do. 
On the trip to make photocopies I 
shot his storefront, Oliveto Furniture, Main Street, and the 
curious sign for an optometrist whose name is "Magliocco," could 
be taken as "Mal occhio" or "evil eye"!

IAW-SS-F100890.B: 
I go directly to see Margaret Sicilia at her quilting group 
in the basement of the Notre Dame church. 
My immediate regret is 
that I didn't get here earlier and have more time. 
An ideal and 
cooperative group of (mainly) Italian women doing a good Mormon 
activity, Italian style! 
They let me set up the mike and answer 
my questions relatively openly in spite of the intrusion this 
obviously is. 
I have the feeling I would get more were I to come 
back again. 
Some of the women might respond more in a one-on-one 
interview. 
I wish I had more time with them, but some have to leave. 
They do meet every Monday and Tuesday, 9:00-11:00 a.m., and it 
would be good to return. 
We have a very brief lunch in the 
Church kitchen before I leave.

I check back in my room briefly before my 1:00 p.m. 
appointment with Stan Litizzette, and it's good that I do so. 
I 
have a call from Frank Dalpiaz. 
I call him back, and he says to 
call him after my interview with Litizzette--maybe we can meet 
with Borla then.

on to [Stan] Litizzette, who is a great talker--very 
opinionated! 
A local liberal, and a wonderful person. 
I lose 
some of the interview (5-10 minutes?) because the tape recorder 
became unplugged. 
But he really was a pleasurable interview, 
diverging in some interesting ways from the others. 
Later--in 
the following interview with Borla and Dalpiaz--I learn that 
today the Governor has appointed Litizzette to head the State 
Commission to prepare to celebrate Columbus Day, 1992.

I call Frank Dalpiaz and he suggests we meet across the 
street at Walter Borla's office in the post office right away. 
We do, and we have a pleasant interview. 
I wish I knew more 
about the office of Postmaster. 
Isn't it a political plum? 
Borla is pictured on the walls posing with notables like Ted 
Kennedy. 
Carbon County--at least Helper and the Italians--are a 
real FDR-style, liberal bastion in conservative, Republican, 
Utah. 
After the interview, I go photograph some stonework I had 
noticed earlier in Helper and call it a day.
