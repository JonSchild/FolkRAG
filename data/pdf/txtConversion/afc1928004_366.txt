I WANT TO SEE THE OLD HOME. 
Words by FRANK DUMONT. 
Music by JAMES E. 
STEWART. 
The Music of this song is published by J. L. PETERS, 595 Broadway, New 
York. 
Price 30 cents. 
I'VE wandered very far away 
From the clime where I 
was born, 
And my poor heart has been so sad, 
Dejected and forlorn ; 
No master kind to treat me well, 
To cheer me when in pain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old home again. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, the good old days are pass'd and gone, 
I 
sigh for them in vain ; 
I 
want to see the cotton fields 
And the dear old home again. 
I'm left all sad and lonely now, 
When my days are very few, 
My wife and children both are gone, 
I 
don't know what to do; 
Old master too, he may be dead, 
His hair was turning gray ; 
Oh, let me see that good old home 
Before I 
pass away. 
Oh, the good old days, etc. 
When I 
was free I 
left that land 
Where the days are bright and fair, 
Where missus spoke to me so kind, 
When I 
was bowed with care ; 
I 
left that home no friends to find, 
My heart was fill'd with pain ; 
Oh, take me to that good old home, 
To see it once again. 
Oh, the good old days, etc.

STEADY COMPANY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
By N. 
ITARDIGAN. 
ell! ain't it nice on Wednesday eve, 
The time when lovers meet, 
To have your aid lean on your arm, 
Oh, my! ain't it a 
treat! 
Just once a 
week a 
call I 
make, 
To see my little one, 
She's just as sweet to me as cake 
Or a 
dainty sugar plum. 
CHORUS. 
I 
sm keeping steady, steady company, 
Where there is lots of fun, yes, lots of fur for me; 
I 
visit Jane on Wednesday eve, 
Just when the clock strikes nine. 
Now, really, folks, I 
do believe 
Some day she will be mine; 
Her folks have no objection 
To my calling at the house, 
For I'm high in their affections, 
Just as innocent as a 
mouse. 
Jane blushes, too, all over her face, 
When I 
kiss her at the door, 
In all her blush and smile I 
trace, 
A 
lingering wish for more. 
I 
am keeping, eta 
Now, young men, all just bear in mind, 
Same charmer you must get; 
Some nice young damsel you must find, 
That you can call your pet. 
And call on her just once a 
week, 
You can do it if you try, 
With kisses one another greet, 
The same as Jane and I. 
I 
am keeping, etc.

PRETTY KITTY MAY. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. StEmx. 
The music of this song is published by E. H. Haniorso, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
I 
KNOW a 
little girl, 
The best in all the world; 
Her equal is not living in the land! 
I 
see her ev'ry day, 
My pretty Kitty May, 
And when we meet I 
squeeze her little handl 
Oh! how she makes me sigh! 
She's just as sweet as pie! 
O 
pretty Kitty May, 
So charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land; 
She says she will be mine— 
() happiness divine! 
For me she wears a 
ring upon her hand. (Dame.) 
She's worth her weight in gold, 
And lovely to behold; 
Her smile of love, so gentle and serene, 
Shines o'er me like the sun, 
And will when we are one; 
0, won't she be a 
perfect little queen. 
Oh, how she makes me sigh I 
She's just as sweet as pie! 
O 
pretty Kitty May, 
So charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land; 
She says she will be mine-
0, happiness divine! 
For me she wears a 
ring upon her hand. (
Thsam.) 
No voice can sing as sweet, 
No form can look so neat; 
I 
know no gladness when we are apart; 
I 
wish the weary day 
To fly with wings away, 
That I 
may press her fondly to my heart! 
Oh, how she makes me sigh! 
She's just as sweet as pie! 
O 
pretty Kitty May, 
So charming and so gay; 
Her equal is not living in the land; 
She says she will be mine-
0, happiness divine! 
For me she wears a 
ring upon her hand. (Dance.)

THE DAYS WHEN THIS OLD NIGGER WAS 
YOUNG. 
Am.—" 
The good old days of Adam and Eve." 
I'LL sing you a 
song that never has been sung, 
'Bout the good ole days when dis nigger was young,; 
And when you hears it, you'll say " dat's so," 
For I 
know what I 
tells you, an' tells what I 
know. 
Singing, oh, dear 1 
what queer things have sprung 
Since de safe ole times when dis nigger was young. 
In de days I 
was young, nigger's wool didn't hang high, 
Poultry sold cheap and chickens wasn't shanghigb.; 
Young folks went to meetin' an' didn't go to musses, 
And folks went into hominy instead of bomnybusses. 
Singing, oh, dear! etc. 
In dem ole times, why a 
church wasn't a 
pay house, 
An' the pulpit didn't wear clothes like a 
play-house ; 
Den folks sung together by the sigh of dar voices, 
An' dey didn't pay the choir for makin' all de noises. 
Singing, oh, dear! etc. 
On de ole turnpike dar was no railway crashes, 
Den de liquor still didn't make the brandy smashes; 
Folks didn't get frightened at too many news, 
Den cobblers didn't burn soles, but dey mended shoes. 
Singing, oh, dear! etc.

GOOD-BYE, 
LIZA JANE. 
AWAY down south where I 
was born, 
I 
busk the wood and chop the corn, 
Walk that loo, oh ! miss loo, 
Ah! ah ! au ! hear me now : 
A 
roasted ear to the house I 
bring, 
The overseer cotch me and made me sing. 
Walk that loo, oh! miss loo. 
Ah ! ah! ah ! hear me now : 
For I 
am going away to leave you, good-bye, good-bye. 
I 
am going away to leave you, good-bye, Liza Jane. 
Oh! I'm going away to leave you, oh! I 
am going down to 
Lynchburat own, 
If you get there before I 
do, oh! good-bye, Liza Jane, 
Ducks play cards and chickens drink wine, 
And monkeys grow upon grape vines; 
Walk that loo, oh ! miss loo, 
Ah! ah! ah! hear me now; 
Corn- starch pudding and tapioca pie, 
Oh! the gray eat picked out the black cat's eye. 
Walk that loo, etc. 
The old cow in the young cow's shed, 
Fell over a 
corn and broke off her head; 
Walk that loo, oh ! miss loo. 
Ah! ah ! ah ! hear me now ; 
And when the jackass heard the row, 
He stabbed himself with the tail of a 
cow. 
Walk that loo, ete. 
A 
nigger came from Arkansaw, 
The worst old fool I 
ever saw; 
Walk that loo, oh ! miss loo. 
Ah! ah 
ah ! hear me now ; 
He went some water for to get, 
And be carried it home in a 
corn basket. 
Walk that loo, etc.

Ort! happy eyes, look up in mine, 
And fill again my heart with love; 
Those pretty sparkling eyes of thine 
Are lustrous as the stars above ; 
They speak to me of by-gone days, 
When we together often played, 
And they remind me of the ways 
Where arm in arm we often strayed. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! happy eyes, look up in mine, 
And fill again my heart with love; 
Those pretty sparkling eyes of thine 
Are lustrous as the stars above. 
Oh! happy eyes, look up in mine, 
And cheer me with your precious light ; 
I 
love to see them when they shine, 
And sparkle, too, like diamonds bright; 
They tell me of the long ago 
When we, as children, often played, 
And they recall, so soft and low, 
The childish vows you often made. 
Oh! happy eyes, eta. 
Oh! happy eyes, look up in mine, 
And tell the loving tales of yore ; 
Our rambles thro' the meadows fine, 
The kisses at the cottaae door; 
Oh! whisper if you love the same 
As in the days that long have passed, 
And breathe again the fond, pet name 
That pleased me when I 
saw you last. 
Oh ! happy eyes, etc.

liTOONLIGHT AT CAPE MAY 
Oh ! my poor heart is not my own, 
It was stolen by a 
charming girl, 
Whose eyes are black and full of love 
And her teeth as white as pearl. 
How we Iirst met I'll now- 
tell you: 
'Twas to me such a 
happy day : 
'Twas down on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
CHORUS . 
How sweet to me this girl did seem, 
The dear one of my happy dream— 
She's such a 
little beauty, 
Like a 
butterfly light and gay. 
I 
met her on the beach, in the evening, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
Oh I 
she was gazing ealml .. , 
As the waves rolled near her feet; 
She turned her head as I 
came by : 
Then, of course, our eyes did meet. 
We spoke about the sweet moonlight, 
While the hours they passed away. 
As we walked, I 
was so happy, 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me, &a 
Next evening as I 
passed the house, 
I 
called my love to see; 
And side by side we rambled on, 
It was hours of bliss to me. 
I 
asked her if she would have me: 
"For I 
love you," I 
did say. 
She promised then to be rtiy wif 
In the moonlight at Cape May. 
How sweet to me, tte.

Co., 27 
Wash. 
ington st., Boston. 
Price 40 cents. 
UPON the'rnstic bridge we met 
One afternoon in spring ; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailing on the lake, 
And all the park was gay; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way ! 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night; 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight; 
I 
seemed in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat, 
And while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell rue, is there, dear ? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park." 
We strolled along where roses grew, 
And all was bright and fair; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home; 
They heard my lips'reply, 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we said good-bye.

TIEBRE IS NO HARM IN KISS-ING.—Concluded. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
Its dear bewitching spell ! 
We lingered though the hour was late. 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
He softly to me said, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing ; 
Pray tell me, is there, dearl 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park."

LOST in the wide world, hopeless and weary; 
Gone is the gladness that made life so dear! 
Dark is my pathway, lonesome and dreary ; 
No smile to cheer me is lingering near I 
Once bloom'd around me life's fairest roses; 
Loved ones and fond ones now cheer me no more; 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
cnoRcs. 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
Lost in the wide world, wand'ring in sadness, 
Dreaming of dear ones who left me in tears, 
Stars of the midnight whisper with gladness, 
" 
Loved ones are waiting, then hush all tny fears!"

YOU NEVER MISS THE WATER TILL THE 
WELL RUNS DRY. 
When a 
child I 
lived at Flushing with my parents at the farm, 
The lessons that my mother taught to me were quite a 
alarm 
She would often take me on her knee when tired of childish play, 
And as she pressed me to her breast I've heard my mother say ; 
CHORUS. 
Waste not, want not, is a 
maxim I 
would teach, 
Let your watch- word be despatch and practice what you proack, 
Do not let your chances like sunbeams pass you by, 
For you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
As years roll'd on I 
grew to be a 
mischief-making boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport it was my only joy, 
And well do I 
remember when oftimes well chastised, 
How father sat beside me, and thus has me advised ; 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
When I 
arrived at manhood I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, bestrewn with care and strife, 
I 
speculated foolishly, my losses were severe, 
But still a 
little voice kept whispering in my ear. 
Waste not, want not, &c. 
Then I 
studied strict economy and found to my surprise, 
My funds instead of sinking very quickly then did rise, 
I 
grasped each chance and always struck the iron while twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities and never once forgot: 
Waste no, want not, ctc. 
I'm married now and happy, I've a 
careful little wife, 
We live in peace and harmony devoid of care and strife, 
Fortune smiles upon us, we have 
tic children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them, as they prattle round my knee; 
Wast. ,ro. want not. ctr.e.

IINNGLER. 
IT 
is true I'm deep in love, 
But think I 
ain't to blame ; 
For Cupid's dart has pierced my heart; 
I 
feel love's burning flame. 
'Twas an ev'ning clear and cab', 
The stars shone bright above ; 
I'll ne'er forget, ' twas then I 
met 
The one I 
dearly love. 
CHORUS. 
She told me something very sweet, 
That she wished nie not to repeat ; 
I 
ne'er forget that night, 
While walking through the grove, 
By what she said, I 
think I'll wed 
The one I 
dearly love. 
• 
There's sunshine in her smile, 
Her eyes with beauty beam ; 
So fresh and fair, with nut-brown hair, 
I 
saw her in my dream. 
And as each day goes by, 
My every thought is of 
This lo-wely girl with teeth like pearl, 
The one I 
dearly love. 
She told me, etc. 
I 
have something else to tell, 
Which always makes me laugh ; 
She sent a 
note, in which she wrote, 
" 
I 
want your photograph.' 
I 
sent it with my love, 
As that I 
wished to prove ; 
She"' now my wife, through care and strife, 
The One I dearly love.

To " fix thin“s" true and trusty for a 
good and healthy " biz

I " button-holed the locals," and I 
advertised the mills;

Working ahead, working ahead; I 
tell you it's a

To have the agent Iwking nice, if clothes were not his own;

And if a

Making music ev'rywhere '1

From " benzine" to abstain, 
The police, they would come and say. 
"'Ile old man's drunk again."

THE HAPPY FAXILY. 
No doubt you've seen that rare sight, 
The wonder of the age, 
Where dogs and rats, and mice and cats, 
Are all kept in one cage. 
Well she I 
love is now the head 
Of that communitee 
For she's married to a 
member 
Of the happy fatnilee. 
For she's married, & c. 
She was the finest cookmaid, 
"You'd find around the square, 
And she was lair as she was fat, 
And fat as she was fair 1 
And never did I 
once surmise 
A 
girl so proud as she. 
Would be married, &c. 
'Twas on a 
Friday evening 
She pledged to me her vow, 
The kitchen fire was blazing bright, 
I 
think I 
see it now; 
For I 
sat by the side of it, 
With Sarah on my knee. 
But she married, cte. 
Upon the wedding morning, 
The bonds of love fell loose, 
The weasel killed the cockatoo, 
The fox destroyed the goose; 
The ourang-outang then made a 
rush 
And choked the chimpanzee. 
And she's married, &c. 
But soon the times grew harder 
Folks would not see the show, 
Or if they did they would not pay, 
And so the funds got low; 
The keepers quarrelled and upset 
The whole menagerie. 
And she's married, dm. 
When last I 
saw my Sarah, 
flow fallen was her state, 
Her loving lord stirred up the beasts, 
While she took round the plate; 
And by the bundle which she bore, 
'Twas vary plain to see, 
That she had brought another member, 
To the happy familee.

When she was with us here on earth, 
That God would wipe away all sorrows 
That did not have in sin their birth.

I' SE a-gettin' old an' feeble, an' my bar is turning gray, 
An' my feet am weary roaming ' round de earth,

Back to Dixie an' de ole home of my birth; 
But dar ain't no use in trying, for I 
knows I 
cannot go, 
An' my heart is fill'd with sadness an' wid pain; 
For .my heart is bin a-sigliin' for de friends I 
used to know, 
For I'd like to see de ole home once again. 
CHORUS. 
Dar's but little consolation for a 
darkey ole as me,. 
Dar's but one good place ob rest I 
eber saw; 
Down upon de ole plantation ' twas as happy as could be. 
My ole home in Alabama, ' fo' de war. 
Oh, dar ain't no use in weepin' for de happy days dat's gone— 
For de happy days when I 
was at my home, 
When we use to hoe de cotton an' de sugar-cane an' corn, 
An' my feet was eber ready for to come; 
But I'd like to go to Dixie for to see de home again, 
Just to live at home anoder happy year, 
Whar my heart would be so happy in de sunshine an' de rain, 
Wid de white folks an' de darkeys eber near. 
Dar's but little consolation, etc.

With our merry voices ringing, 
For everything looks bright and gay, 
For ' tis the darkeys' gala day. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, glory break, oh, glory break, 
Rebecca Jane, wake up, I

For don't you see ' tis break of day,

They thought to make us early birds, and tried to spoil our 
fun, 
They pass'd a 
law compelling ev'ry house to close at one. 
It did'ut suit my book at first I 
often told them so; 
But bless you leave it all to me, I'll show you where to go.

There's " Champagne Charlie" he's my friend, you've heard 
of him I 
know, 
You're sure to see him somewhere near wherever I 
may go, 
We're known at ev'ry place at night, and ev'ry where we're 
seen, 
And being single there are none to ask us where we've been.

We get into a 
row sometimes, when out so late at night, 
But when Policeman X 
appears we always make it right; 
We knock at doors and pull the bells our leisure time to kill, 
If the police don't know us now, I'm sure they never will. 
Cno.—Then who's coming out, &c.

Then who's coming out for a

The smartest song and taste the best Champagne and bitter

We'll board a

We'll drink and smoke, we'll dance and sing, then who's

THAT'S 
iUi KIND OP A GAWK I AM. 
Written and Composed by W M. H . 
DELEHANTY. 
GII! my name is Timothy Harmless, 
From a 
land that's wide and wild, 
I'm a 
regular mule in harness, 
And a 
wild-cat when I'm riled; 
Yes, a 
Buffalo Bill, by jingo! 
All the way from Huberdam, 
But I 
ain't much on the lingo, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
CHORUS. 
But how is this for harmless, 
While I 
sling my harness, 
Yes I'm from the rural district, 
I'm a 
Cincinnati ham, 
And I 
came to see the Elephant, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
ant. 
I'm a 
jaybawk from the country, 
As you all can plainly see, 
Tho' I 
ain't no Mace-O'Baldwin, 
Nor a 
Heenan-Morrisey; 
While I 
don't use knife or pistol, 
And I'm happy as a 
clam, 
I 
can make an eye look crystal, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
But how is this, ete. 
While I 
walked down the street to-day, 
Rigged up in awful style, 
I 
met a 
gal primped up so gay—  • 
And couldn't help but smile 
We went into a 
restaurant, 
Had oysters, gin and jam, 
I 
let her put up every cent, 
That's the kind of a 
gawk I 
am. 
But how is this, etc.

Kiss me, mother, kiss yew. darling. 
Lean my head upon your breast, 
Fold your loving arms around me. 
I

Scenes of life are swiftly fading, 
Brighter seems the other shore: 
I 
am standing by the river, 
Angels wait to waft me o'er. 
Kiss me, mother, kiss your darling 
Lean my head upon your breast, 
Fold your loving arras around me, 
I 
am weary, let me rest. 
lEiss me, mother, kiss your darling, 
Breathe a 
blessing on my brow: 
For, IT. soon be with the Angels, 
Fainter grows my breath e'en now. 
Tell the loved ones not to murmur; 
Say I 
died our Flag to save, 
And that I 
shall slumber sweetly

KITTY WELLS. 
You as what makes this darkie weep, 
Why he like others am not gay,

From early morn till close of day.

For in my memory fresh it dwells, 
It will cause you all to drop a 
tear 
On the grave of my sweet Kitty Wells. 
CHORUS. 
While the birds were singing in the morning, 
And the myrtle and the ivy were in bloom, 
And the sun on the hill was a 
dawning, 
It was then we laid her in the tomb. 
I 
never shall forget the day, 
That we together roamed the dells, 
I 
kissed her cheek, and named the day 
That I 
should marry Kitty Wells. 
But death came in my cabin door, 
And took from me my joy and pride, 
And when I 
found she was no more, 
I 
laid my banjo down and cried. 
While the birds, *A

often wish that I 
was de ad, 
And laid beside her in the tomb. 
The sorrow that bows down my head 
Is silent in the midnight gloom. 
The spring time has no charm for me, 
Though flowers are blooming in the dells, 
For that bright form I 
do not see, 
'Tis the form of isay sweet Kitty Wells.

DANCING BOY. 
Written and sung by JADIES Bu.snLET. 
No doubt you've heard of the Active Boys 
Also the Lively Make, 
But I've got one that's full of fun, 
You will see I'm not telling a 
joke ; 
It's all about this nigger here, 
And of my funny ways, 
How I 
sing to please the folks, 
That's the way I 
pass the days. 
ClIORIJES. 
I'm my parents' only joy, 
They say I 
am their dancing boy; 
Twist my heel like any eel, 
Jump up high and down again; 
The neighbors think I'm awfully wild; 
My father calls me his darling child; 
Indeed it's so I'll have you know, 
I've got it on the brain. 
To balls and parties I 
always go, 
Whenever I 
get the chance, 
I 
take my gal, her name is Sal; 
Around the room we dance. 
When the ball is over, 
It breaks up in a 
fight; 
The fiddler breaks his fiddle, 
While the committee all get tight. 
I'm my parents', etc.

Oh! ever I'm dreaming of you; 
I've watch'd for your steps in the gloaming

Your letters I 
keep near my heart I 
Oh, life would be sorrow without you, 
And never again may we part; 
When spring-time in splendor and glory 
Returns with its roses and dew, 
Come whisper the sweet olden story, 
And tell me you're faithful and true. 
CHORUS. 
The songs of the robin and starling, 
Ah! still they remind me of you—

Even my dog has left me. 
Well, well, 
I'm only waiting for de summons to come along for poor old 
Pomp. Many and many a 
year I've trabbled on de road, and 
I'm footsore and weary now. 
[Enter HENRY.]

for the last seven or eight years. 
But how is everything on 
the old plantation ? 
POMP.—All gone to ruin. 
Everybody ' cept me gone dead. 
HENRY. — Cheer up, old friend. 
Why, you used to be as

cricket. 
No song was as gay as yours on the old 
plantation.

haven't the heart to pick 
on de strings any more.

Oh, I 
once was happy all the day, and never knew a 
care, 
And my good old wife she wandered by my side; 
Our little home was humble, but happiness was there,-
'Twas the sweetest spot in all the world so wide, 
Now 'tis sinking to decay, and all is dark and sad, 
And I 
bear upon the roof the falling rain; 
E'en the banjo now is silent, that once made my heart so glad. 
In my little old log cabin in the lane. 
Cho.-Ali, yea, I'm old and feeble now, dic. 
So I'll totter to my journey's end, and try to do my best, 
Though I'm sad and weary-hearted all the day; 
The angels soon will call me, I 
soon will be at rest 
In that bright and happy home so far away. 
Still I 
linger by the door, and try to sing my song 
As I 
used to do among the sugar cane; 
And I'm waiting for the summons, and it soon will come alai% 
To my little old log cabin in the lane.

THE CREAM-COLORED HORSE. 
As sung by Hinny Sreacwoon, 2,000 times, with wonderful success. 
Ara.—" The Flying Trapeze." 
LISTEN to me, I've a 
sad tale of woe, 
A 
heart-ren ding story that you must all know, 
Of 
a 
beautiful girl who had me for her beau ; 
To marry we both did agree, 
Our vows were most solemnly plighted, 
And I 
was so happy of course, 
Like a 
cabbage, my hopes she then blighted 
For a 
man on a 
cream -colored horse. 
CHORUS. 
He rode round the ring with the greatest of ease, 
Shot through the hoop like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Stood on his head while his toe he would seize, 
And flip-flapped all over the ring. 
I 
took Liza Jane to the circus one night, 
To witness this daring equestrain flight ; 
She applauded so loudly, they all thought she was tight, 
Goodness ! how jealous I 
got'? 
Says I, " L:za Jane, do be quiet," 
Says she, " you are not my boss." 
Then she hollered for two quarts of pea-nuts 
For the man on the cream-colored plug. 
CHORUS. 
Still the gawk rode around the ring with vehemence, 
Shot through the hoop like a 
bullet through cheese, 
Stood on his head while his toe he would seize, 
And flip-flapped all over the ring. 
He came out again with a 
flop and a 
whirl, 
When he came right side up, he winked at my girl ; 
I 
had a 
great notion my cane then to twirl 
At this man in spangles and tights. 
She threw him a 
kiss back so quickly, 
For my feelings she had no respect ; 
And as he rode ' round the circle 
I 
wished that he might break his neck. 
SPOKEN.—But he didn't, for, 
CHORUS. 
He rode round the ring, with utmost ease, 
Broke paper in the hoop, didn't touch knees, 
Stood on his bald head, and neck- tie would seize, 
This man on the sl:im-milk mule. 
• 
TUE CREAM-COLORED HORSE.—Continued. 
When we got home, we'd a 
terrible row, 
I 
called her false-hearted, she'd broken her vow, 
Says she, ' quit my sight, I 
am done with you now, 
l'm engaged to the star of the ring, 
I'll be called on the bills 
Senorita,' 
We will travel together of course, 
I'll do a 
flip-flop on his eye-brow 
As he rides on his cream- colored horse." 
CHORUS. 
Don't touch him, harm him not, the Epizootic he's got, 
The horse talks one way, the feller does not ; 
My song is now ended I'll go to my cot, 
Please excuse that eccentric old mule. 
THE CHESTNUT MAN. 
Written expressly for HARRY STANWOOD by the late J. B. 3fraPHY 
On, listen to the doleful strain, 
That I'm a- going to sing you, 
About a 
tall Italian, and 
A gal that him did cling to ; 
He kept a 
stand upon Broadway, 
hot roasted chestnuts selling, 
And the stamps he took in every day, 
his pockets all were swelling. 
There was a 
maiden short and fat, 
With feelings soft and tender, 
And she fell in love with the chestnut man, 
Because he was so slender, 
And he loved her with all his might, 
And called her " ducky honey," 
And sold her chestnuts every night, 
And wouldn't take any money. 
One day this maiden went for to go 
For to see her Italian lover, 
When she tell in front of an omnibus, 
And quickly was run over ; 
When the chestnut man beheld the sight, 
And knew she was a 
corpus. 
He swallowed a 
quart of chestnuts down, 
And died of cholera morbus

OLAR DE KITCHEN. 
In old Kenttick, in de arternoon,

And dis de song dat we do sing., 
Cla0uus.-0, dare de kitchen, old folks, young folks, 
Clare de kitchen. old folks, young folks, 
Old Virginny never tire. 
I

couldn't get across, 
I'd nobody wid rue but an old blind horse; 
But Old Jim Crow came riding by, 
Says he, " Old fellow, your horse will die." 
it's clare de kitchen, &c. 
My horse fell down upon de spot, 
Says he, " Don't you see his eyes is sot ?" 
So I 
took out my knife, and off wid his skin, 
And when he comes to life I'll ride him agin. 
So clsre de kitchen, & c. 
A 
jay-bird sot on a 
hickory limb— 
He wink'd at me, and I 
wink'd at him; 
I 
pick'd up a 
stone and I 
hit his shin— 
Says he, " You better not do dat agin." 
So dare de kitchen, &c. 
A bull-frog dress'd in soger's close, 
Went in de field to shoot some crows; 
De crows smell powder and fly away— 
De bull-frog mighty mad dat day. 
So dare de kitchen, & c. 
Den down I 
went wid Cato Moore 
To see de steamboat come ashore; 
Every man for himself, so I 
pick'd up a 
trunk— 
" 
Let off," said de captain, " or I 
burn you wid a 
chunk." 
And dare de kitchen, & c. 
I 
hab a 
sweetheart in dis town, 
She wears a 
yellow, striped gown; 
And when she walks de streets around, 
De hollow of her foot make a 
hole in de ground. 
Now clare de kitchen, &s. 
Die love is a 
ticklish ting. you know, 
it makes a 
body feel all over so; 
I

She as black as tan of spades, and got a 
lubly fiat nose. 
So clare de kitchen, &c. 
"Go way," says she, " wid your cowcumber shin, 
If you come here agin I 
stick you wid a 
pin;' 
So I 
turn on my heel, and bid her good bye, 
And arter I 
was gone, she began for to cry. 
So dare de kitchen, &c. 
So now I'se up and off you see, 
To take a 
julep sangaree;

tater hill, 
And eat a

So clare de kitchen, 8r.c. 
I 
wish I

For since I

De gals so proud dey won't eat mush; 
And when you go to court 'em day say, " Oh hush !" 
So clare de kitchen, & c.

And make.3 de banjo ring ; 
The girls say l'm too sweet to live, 
When I

I'm going to tell of a 
pretty girl, 
A 
meerschamn-colored belle ; 
She's hy-per-coon in the fish-ball room, 
At Leland's big hotel. 
I 
met her first at a 
fancy hop, 
In South Fifth Avenue ; 
When I 
got there my charmer fair 
Was worrying an oyster stew. 
I 
sought an introduction and 
I 
soon was by her side, 
Which made me feel as happy 
As. a 
soft clam at high tide. 
I 
asked her for to fly with me 
To some secluded spot ; 
She said it wasn't fly time, 
And thought she'd better not. 
We agreed to wait till summer, 
Till the beans and peas were ripe ; 
But she choked that night with a 
Russian towel 
She ate for a 
piece of tripe. 
TYROLEAN DUCKS. 
As sung by JENNIE H UGHES. 
W HF.NEVER ducks go two by two, 
They're surely got something in view, 
And what it is they will not tell, 
Although themselves they know it well, 
They smooth the feathers on their back, 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack, quack. 
cnonus 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack, 
Tra oh la uh, tra la, tra lab uh, ah 
Quack, quack, quack. 
Whenever ducks go three by three, 
It puzzles much both you and me ; 
Are there two drakes and but one duck, 
Or but a 
single drake in luck ? 
They smooth the feathers on his back, 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack, quack. 
Quack, quack, quack, etc. 
WALKING IN THE SNOW. 
SONG AND DANCE . 
Orm afternoon in winter, 
When the snow was falling fast, 
A 
walking down a 
by street, 
There a 
maid I 
chanced to pass. 
Her face it looked quite ruddy, 
At least I 
thought it so; 
I 
turned around and spoke to her, 
A 
walking in the snow. 
CHORUS . 
Walking in the snow, boys, 
Not going very fast, 
I 
thought it mighty pleasant, 
And the time so quickly passed 
Oh, she's a 
little darling, 
As time to me did show, 
I 
bless the day I 
met her 
A 
walking in the snow. 
As we walked along, not thinking 
Of the time that flew so fast, 
She said to me, in sweetest tones, 
" 
I've reached my home at last." 
As by the door we parted, 
I 
said to her, " good-bye, 
I'll see you, love, to-morrow, 
As the twilight hour draws nigh." 
Walking in the snow, etc. 
A 
year and more we courted, 
Without having any strife, 
I 
asked this darling creature, 
If she would become my wife. 
She said to me, " my loved one, 
Anon I'll let you know, 
But if I 
do, I'll ne'er forget 
Our walking in the snow."

RAILWAY GUIDE. 
- 
As sung by JENNIE Hnuansf 
I 
HAD to make a 
journey a 
little while ago, 
Somewhere down the Jersey Central, you must know ; 
A 
splendid-looking man, lie was seated by my side, 
lie asked me if I 
would lend to hint my Railway Guide. 
The man he was troubled with absence of mind. 
The ticket for his journey he had left it far behind, 
He could not recollect the town to which he wished to ride, 
So he begged that I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he had actually forgotten the name of the 
town that he wished to travel to. Could only remember that the 
word contained the letter B, Al or K. So I 
began to run through 
a 
list of towns whose name contained that letter, such as : _ 
CHORUS. 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, Neversink and Squadunk, 
There's Peekskill and Fishkill and Catskill beside, 
Weehawken and Hoboken, Binghamton and Stonington, 
He said he'd mire to find it in my Railway Guide. 
Then I 
produced my Appleton, and said to him, " Good man, 
Take the book I'm reading and find it if you can. 
He took the volume from my hand and eagerly be tried 
To find the place he wanted in my Railway. Guide. 
He searched o'er every leaf, and turned o'er every page, 
Until at last the fellow he got in quite a 
rage, 
lie soon turned round to me, and bitterly he cried : 
" 
Dear Miss ! I 
cannot find it in your Railway Guide." 
SPOREL—Although he said he had read all through, 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, etc. 
I 
reached my destination and was going to alight, 
He placed his hand upon my arm, and said with much affright, 
" 
Oh, dear Miss! don't leave me all alone to ride, 
What shall I 
do without you, and yom Railway Guide 7" 
&tid I, " Oh no, I'm going, down now to my hotel, 
You, sir, cannot walk with me, for it woui I 
not look well," 
But he linked his arm in mine, and kept marching by my side, 
He kept a 
firm grasp on me and my Railway Guide.

RAILWAY GUIDE.—Continued. 
SPOKEN.—And, said he, if we put our heads *ether, 
shall certainly soon discover whether it is— 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, etc. 
He walked with me in silence, some distance on the road, 
I 
knew not how to leave him, when I 
got to my abode ; 
And all that afternoon, the foolish fellow tried, 
To pay attention to rue and my Railway Guide; 
And once he plucked up courage, and squeezed my little glove 
He suddenly discovered that he was deep in love ; 
He proposed and I 
accepted, I'm soon to be his bride, 
And thus I'll gain a 
husband with my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.—And he tells me it makes him feel so happy, that 
he don't care if he never arrives either at 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, etc.

Come along, you butchers out of Spain,

Sun.—Now mind, Johnny, and make the enemy run, 
You look so nice when you shoulder your gun. 
HE.—If I

You bet I'll see them make tracks. 
SHE.—But you must fight them face to face, 
If they fight me they'll have to race, 
For he who fights and runs away 
Will live to fight another day.
