Dear Bess,
 
I found it quite heartbreaking to
 
picture you in the NEA office,  cleaning
 
out the  files.
 If  the powers  that be
 
had the  slightest idea of how much
 
passion and  thought and devotion went
 
into creating  the Program.
 
As  I mentioned,  I' m sending along
 
our new Culture Catalog.
 It's an effort
 
to provide a needed service for  teachers
 
around  the country,  and also  to generate
 
some earned revenue for our new teachers
 
center.
 
I look forward  to  seeing you and
 
Anna when you' re  in New York.
 
All  tb
 est,
 
Steve
 
PS  If you have  thoughts on what should
 
be included in  the next edition of  this
 
let us  know.

Dear Tony,
 
This Christmas I got a nice card from Duff Severe, the National Heritage
 
Fellowship winner from Oregon who now lives in Pendleton, Oregon.  You may
 
not have known about it but a year or so before you got to Salem, Duff let
 
us know he wanted to buy some time to work with his nephew who he felt had
 
good potential talent as a leather worker, and we sent Steve Siporin in from
 
Idaho to help work out a fundable arrangement.  We eventually put up some
 
money under our federal apprenticeship category and Duff, as he put It,
 
"matched" it with a donation of extra time.  Anyway, he reported to me in a
 
note on his Christmas card:
 
.
...I sure want to thank you for helping my nephew Robin get his learning
 
grant.  It worked out just great.  I worked him on rawhide braiding until the
 
grant was used up.  He was such a good learner that I decided to match the
 
grant with my own time and work him on into saddle making.  He's just cooking
 
on all four burners now.  He works full time at it and is able to make a good
 
living for his family.  I wanted to let you know that the grant sure wasn't
 
wasted...  May the holidays find you most cheerful and happy...
 
We don't do individual apprenticeships from the federal side now, as you know,
 
but I
've written Duff that if he has another potential "good learner" we'll
 
try to help him work something out.  In the meantime, is there any chance of
 
an apprenticeship program developing at the Oregon Arts Council or any other
 
state agency?  We are, as you know, still helping Jan DeWeese's Portland
 
project but that may be coming to an end.  I hope not.
 
Well, mustn't ramble.  Let me echo Duff and hope that the holidays found you
 
most cheefful and happy too.
 
With all good wishes from Dan Sheehy and me,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

Folk Arts Program
 
FOLK ARTS AND VOCATIONAL EDUCATION.
 
A report on the first collaboration between the Rhode Island State
 
Council on the Arts/Folk Arts Program and R
.
 i  vocational/
 
Technical  education ;  a folk artist in residence project.
 
Vocational education is often regarded as a poor alternative to a regular
 
high school or college preparatory curriculum.
 Yet, skills learned at a voca-
tional school usually lead to
 successful  employment in a limited number of
 
technical fields for students whose interests do not lie in the more academic
 
subjects.  Generally, a high school graduate who decides NOT to pursue a
 
college education has certain advantages in the job market, in certain fields,
 
with a vocational school diploma.
 It is NOT true that students with a cer-
tification from a vocational/technical school are excluded from applying to
 
college or will be less motivated to do so.  The principal at West Bay
 
Vocational/Technical School  (Coventry, R.I.)
 indicated that, very often,
 
students who enroll in- and successfully complete- courses in specialized
 
fields, such as electronics, are much in demand in industry (
 particularly
 
the ever-growing co m
puter/electronics industry ) and often enroll for college
 
courses  ( sometimes at the expense of the company that hired them as tech-
nicians  ) to acquire skills not offered during their previous education.
 
The skilled craftsmanship acquired at a vocational school is prized
 
by those who are familiar with the rigorous training and the products that
 
are the hallmark of such schools; instruction takes the form of apprenti-
ceship, with a hands-on method of  teaching
 ,  a process similar to the
 
"folk" process, and reminiscent of the guilds.
 
Establishing a folk arts residency in such an educational setting is
 
replete with questions.
 Since we, in the public sector,  strive at presen-
ting folk arts as valid aesthetic endeavours deserving as much attention
 
as mainstream art forms, placing a folk arts±t in a residency in schools
 
which are often perceived as "second best", may reflect on the folk arts
 
and/or on the resident artist ( The Rhode Island State Council on the Arts/
 
Artists-in-Education Program has not organized residencies at vocational
 
schools  )
.
 
Yet, one could almost draw an analogy here between the place of voca-
tional training in the education system, and the place of folk arts in the
 
art world:
 besides the practical needs that lie at the basis of many folk
 
art forms and define vocational education, both face similar problems of
 
recognition and validity.
 Folk arts are  "not really art".
 Yet,  folk
 
traditions exhibit qualities sought after by many mainstream artists:
 folk
 
arts are "connected" contextually, they "belong" to a community,  they exhibit
 
the "spirit" of a group, they have "meaning"...
 This unparalleled root-
edness and authenticity is what makes a folk artist an asset to any educa-
tional experience.
 
In the case of choosing to organize a residency at a vocational school,
 
my decision to transcend some initial objections came from the strong
 
belief that no site that satisfied our Program's basic requirements  ( matching
 
funds, quality programming and administrative capability ) should be denied
 
the support of the Folk Arts Program, and that no group of students should
 
be denied the experience of a workshop or demonstration in folkarts and the
 
aesthetic sensibilities of a folk artist.
 
West Bay Vocational Technical School enrolls its students from regular
 
high schools for a period of three weeks at the time, with a three week
 
break in this on/off cycle.  The students have to make up their lost curri-
cular time upon return to their regular high school program;
 as such, these
 
students suffer from the stigma of being "different".  Not all vocational
 
education in Rhode Island is organized along the sa m
e lines;
 there are a
 
number of alternatives, but West Bay's intensive method seems to be successful.
 
A traditional musical instrument maker was chosen as the most likely
 
candidate, because  (
1) his skills could be integrated in a program that was
 
already in place  ( namely the woodwork shop )
;
 (
2) students attending
 
woodworking classes were already equipped with the adequate knowledge about
 
tools and had acquired the requisite basic skills so that the folk artist's
 
time was used in an optimal manner, and (
3) the artist had served as an artist-
in-residence in a variety of traditional workshops and demonstrations and
 
had received positive evaluations, with t
hers stressing his ability to
 
relate well to students of all ages.
 
After the initial three wee1  session,  I went to the site for an eva-
luation, accompanied by the assistant superintendent of vocational education;
 
we made our visit coincide with that of a reporter so as to avoid disruption
 
of the class at more than one session  ( The newspaper article was compre-
hensive and flattering  )
.
 
The artist is pleased with his residency,  stating that the students
 
are captivated by the activity and exhibit the dexterity and motivation
 
that are required for the completion of their tasks.
 Labelled as  "special
 
needs" students in their home high school,  they reveal,  in this context,
 
a surprising degree of attention and mental acuity.
 
The teacher responsible for the woodworking shop is pleased, not only
 
because his students are engaged in a worthwile project, but because he
 
himself is learning aesthetic dimensions which he would otherwise never have
 
been exposed to.
 He is pleased  that, in addition to functional skills,
 
students have the opportunity to work with materials that are only used
 
in fine woodworking, and have acquired
 
a chance to learn in any other way.
 
The object of this project is not
 
skills that they would never have had
 
to turn every ( or any ) student
 
into a musical instrument maker, but to expose all students to traditional
 
aesthetic dimensions, and to make them realize that many of the skills
 
that they are learning are part of the heritage of their community.
 
The superintendent of vocational education and the school's pricipal
 
are pleased with the development of the project and are looking forward
 
to future residencies at this particular site and at other vocational schools.
 
I would love to hear from other follS/arts
 coordinators who have had
 
contact with vocational education andlfrom
 those who have comments on this
 
type of poject.

BOTSWANA 
"
Bowling Green John Cephas and his blues trio proved to be a highly
 
appropriate, t
imely, and singularly effective Arts America presentation.
 
Cephas, along with Phil Wiggins on the harmonica, and sideman Barry Lee
 
Pearson, are highly personable, flexible in terms of programming, and project
 
a good image of the United States that goes beyond their blues music.  Post
 
assessment of this all-too brief visit is, simply, -
 terrific.  The B
lues Trio
 
had four primary gigs in Gaborone:  A
)  An open-air concert. . .
resulted in a
 
successful 90-minute performance with a total audience of some 500-600.  I
t
 
was deliberate street theater, intended to register an American cultural
 
presence in t
he broadest possible manner, and it worked.  B
)  The DCM hosted a
 
representational dinner, a blues and chili night aimed at the key successor
 
generation audience...  I
t was a genuinely warm occasion at which a key
 
audience was assured of a special relationship with the United States.  C
)  An
 
all-day workshop with the musicians of the Botswana Defense Force (
BDF).  The
 
only school of music in Botswana is the BDF school, and great pride is taken
 
in their ceremonial marching band, their dance band, their disco band, their
 
choir and their t
raditional dance group.  There were morning and afternoon
 
workshop sessions which were marked by mutual exchange of musical technique
 
and folklore, and by the development of a warm exchange, something that the
 
Blues Trio excels at."
 
Z
IMBABWE
  
'
Professionalism and excellent musical quality of the group was evidenced in
 
all performances.  Audiences were thrilled by performances and impressed with
 
the i
nformal, f
riendly manner of the group.  The Cultural Affairs Officer
 
received n
umerous comments such as '
best performance we have heard in years'.
 
Post appreciates ease of working with the Blues Trio.  They were always
 
extremely adaptable and tolerant of sometimes less than perfect sound systems
 
and auditorium space."
 
MAURITIUS
  
"
The American Blues Trio made it look easy during their two Mauritius
 
appearances.  John Cephas, Phil Wiggins and Barry Lee Pearson are welcome back
 
whenever they set foot during an all too brief visit.  The Trio played to a
 
friendly, enthusiastic, first night crowd of more than 600 invitees at Mahatma
 
Gandhi Institute Auditorium, which included the Prime Minister,
 
Attorney-General and Minister of Culture...  The concert was taped by MBC/TV
 
which reran it as an hour-long special, featuring audience interviews...  The
 
evening workshop drew 3
00 pop musicians and young people.  After playing and
 
talking in their easy comfortable style for half an hour, the group was joined
 
by various combinations of four local guitarists and two harmonica players,
 
who delighted themselves and their audience for a solid hour...  An interview
 
with the largest circulation local daily paper and a farewell call on the
 
Minister of Culture wrapped up a highly successful 48-hour schedule."

MADAGASCAR
  
'
The Blues T
rio program in Madagascar, the first American cultural
 
presentation in over two years, was a success.  The Trio was a pleasure to
 
program.  Their music p
rovided audiences with a first-hand experience of a
 
purely and expressively American musical form already appreciated here by many
 
Malagasy.  Their personal manner made them an excellent reflection on the U
.S.'
 
GHANA
  
'
The American Blues Trio was programmed for three days positive activity.
 
Programming included performance/reception hosted by Ambassador T
.W.M. Smith
 
at the residence, media interviews, evening concert at American Center,
 
morning workshop at American Center followed by representational lunch
 
honoring the T
rio and members of Accra Jazz Club...  The T
rio is highly
 
talented and exemplary at all times.  As talented entertainers the Trio is
 
superb and a pleasure to work with...  The down home guitarinanship of John
 
Cephas and Barry Lee Pearson combined with the powerhouse harmonica of Phil
 
Wiggins made a perfect program for Accra...  M4icionados were gratified and
 
the uninitiated became instant country blues devotees thanks to their talents.'
 
MALI
 
"
The concert was very successful and the audience's reaction to the blues was
 
incredibly positive.  I
f we had any doubts about the popularity of the blues
 
here..., they were quickly dispelled once the Trio commenced to play.  The
 
audience was alive and very responsive.  These '
vibes" were immediately felt
 
by the Trio who threw out their planned numbers and went with an entirely
 
different repertoire.  Alternating between sets were the t
wo very popular
 
Malian groups, one modern and the other a more traditional hunters group who
 
played traditional instruments, chanted and danced.  The cnbination was
 
electric and the c
rowd loved it.  They roared, cheered, clapped...  When the
 
Trio j
oined the t
raditional musicians and dancers on the f
loor, the house
 
almost came down.  The performance was clearly an event here that will be
 
talked about for a long time...  Post believes performance went a long way to
 
generate a great deal of goodwill for the U
.S...  Post found the Trio amiable,
 
and very engaging with the ability to quickly establish close rapport with
 
large and small groups.  Language was never an obstacle and the musicians were
 
able to communicate among each other with relative ease.  With simultaneous
 
t
ranslation at the workshops and the concerts, the group was able to
 
effectively communicate their ideas and explain the different numbers they
 
played.'

 The  progress

Dear Bess:
 
I just wanted to add my voice to what must be a chorus of
 
congratulations on the Heritage Awards.  Great!  Charles Kurault
 
was great,  a perfect choice,  and an ideal format;  I loved the
 
minimalist set,  too,  which seemed to look back to the thirties in
 
one way and in another towards the next century. All of it--the
 
interviews,  the physical arrangement,  the sequence of events--for
 
me decisively accompl ished the task of presenting the Fellows,
 
their work,  and of doing honor to them.  Lydia and I left in a
 
very elevated state of mind!
 
Thanks again,  too,  for the interview.  Your thoughts have a
 
wonderfully clarifying influence on me,  which will I hope be
 
reflected in the essay I'm about to finish--it will be the
 
introduction to my book on the FAF.  In all honesty,  Bess,  I don't
 
think anyone has contributed more.
 
Looking forward to seeing you again.
 
Fondly,

Dear Bess:
 
Before any time  can pass,  I wanted  to  say  again how great  I
 
.
.hink the Heritage Awards program was.  It had excellent direction,
 
a great script,  Kuralt's fine reading and time-tested interview
 
abilities,  intriguing staging,  and,  of  course,  that deep cast of
 
awardees.  It really went to another level with its dignity,
 
humor,  emotion and performance.  It could clearly run with success
 
on Broadway,  abroad and  .
.
.
 in Peoria.
 
Thanks for your efforts,  they clear ground for the folks and
 
the folklorists to step into new places in new ways.  I found the
 
program a perfect example for people at Carnegie Hall and the
 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting who attended.
 
So bravo
 
Today is my last official day here at Smithsonian.  Let's get
 
together again soon for lunch and notes.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
  
TENNESSEE COOPER EARNS JAPAN FELLOWSHIP
 
Dr.  Robert Cogswell
 
Director of Folk Arts
 
TUESDAY,  SEPTEMBER 15,  1987
 
Tennessee  folk craftsman Rick Stewart has been selected by  the Nationa
 
Endowment  for the Arts  (NEA)  as one of five recipients of the competitive
 
Creative Artist Fellow hip  for Japan. - 
A maker of buckets,  churns,  and
 
S
 
other staved wooden vessels,  Stewart
 practices cooperage as it was handed
 
down in his Hancock County  family.
 
Hundreds of American artists apply  for  the  fellowships annually.
 
Stewart is the  first Tennessean  and the  first  folk  artist ever  to be
 
honored with the  award.
 In  an exchange program sponsored by  the  Japan-
United States Friendship Commission,  the NEA,  and Japan's Agency  for
 
Cultural Affairs,  the  fellowship will  afford him six months of study with
 
traditional  Japanese coopers next year.
 
Only  27 years old,  Stewart is already  a master of his East  Tennessee
 
mountain craft.
 He learned at the  feet of his renowned grandfather Alex
 
Stewart,  a third generation cooper who was honored with the NEA's National
 
Heritage Fellowship  in 1983 and who died at  age 94 in  1985.
 Inheriting
 
his grandfather's shop  and keeping the  family  tradition alive,  Rick has
 
since gained increasing  recognition  for his own work,  in turn  teaching  a
 
number of apprentices himself and last year serving  as artist-in-
-residence
 
in Hancock County  schools under the Arts in Education Program of the
 
Tennessee Arts Commission.
 
Stewart's interest in  Japan  arose  from his participation  in  the

TENNESSEE  COOPER EARNS JAPAN FELLOWSHIP

American  Folklife in  Washington.
 While demonstrating his craft  there,
 
he struck  up  a friendship with Keichi  Sato,  a maker of sake barrels
 
taking part  in  the  festival's Japanese program.
 Throughout  the  two-week
 
event,  staff interpreters assisted  the two in discussing  their craft
 
techniques,  tools,  and traditions.  .
 They  exchanged ideas and  materials
 
and jointly  constructed  a composite' bucket of Tennessee cedar  staves  and
 
Japanese bamboo hoops.
 
After  the  event,  Stewart  and  Sato corresponded  and  sought ways  to
 
fulfill  invitations to visit  each other's  shops.
 For  Stewart,  the
 
Japanese  fellowship will  make  that  dream come  true.
 Accompanied by  his
 
wife  Emily,  he plans  to  spend a portion  of the  six  months working  with
 
Sato in  Kyoto,  then  to  visit  other  traditional  coopers  and woodworkers
 
throughout  Japan with  the help of hosting  Japanese arts officials.
 
"The  fellowship  sets an  international  precedent in  the  area of  folk
 
bringing  extended contact between grassroots artists  from
 
opposite  sides of the globe.
 Stewart's  selection was especially  appropriat
 
because of the high  respect which  Japan  shows  to its traditional  artists,"
 
according  to Dr.  Robert  Cogswell,  director of  folk  arts at  the  Tennessee
 
Arts  Commission.
 "Japan's program  for honoring  'living national  treasures
 
helped  inspire  the creation  of the NEA's National  Heritage Fellowships,
 
which have brought  recognition  to  outstanding American  folk  artists  like
 
Stewart's grandfather."
 
While  in  Japan,  Rick  and  Emily  Stewart will  serve as  ambassadors  for
 
their home  state  as well.
 The  fellowship  will  strengthen cultural
 
exchanges between Tennessee and Japan,  which have become  strong  economic
 
partners  in  recent years.

Two other volunteers are in the same leaaue with Jalaine;
 
Kim Stafford and Phil Ottum.
 They gave themselves totallv
 
and with as much concern as the directors for three days of
 
108* heat.
 A festival does not succeed without volunteers
 
like these two.
 
Michael Whitenack,  Tommy Griffin,  and the- staff of Presentation
 
Design Group also should be listed as volunteers,  in a sense.
 
They went far beyond a budget that could have been financially
 
profitable to insure that the site and signage were the absolute
 
best.
 Indeed,  after the site was prepared,  I realized that
 
whatever took place at the festival would probably seem good
 
even if it weren' t,  because the setting was so inviting.
 
FOLK ARTS REPORT
 2
 
I feel that the festival was a wonderfully positive experience.
 
You should ask the participants and visitors how they felt.
 
One of my favorite moments was seeing one of our presenters
 
introducing an Indian drummer to a Hmong flute-player.
 They
 
were interested in each other.
 Visit ors
 inc lu de d no t only a
 
United States Congressman and city and county officials,  but
 
large numbers of Hmong and other ethnics who experienced other
 
Americans valuing their culture through its aesthetic modes
 
instead of denigrating it,  simplifying it,  or rejecting it.
 
Where else does that happen today?
 
Your packet today contains the festival booklet and festival
 
program.
 I have a few slides which will give a little better
 
notion of the festival itself.
 
-SLIDE SHOW-
Before  I finish,  I would like to make a final comment.
 
The festival date was picked over half a year ago.
 But on
 
August 8-9,  there were no Oregon Arts Commissioners or the
 
Executive Director present.
 I was bitterly disappointed.
 
This lack of support for your own program has something
 
to do with its failure,  obviously.
 No one can fault the Folk
 
Arts Program in Oregon for its quality and integrety.
 You
 
cannot simply blame the outcome on the legislature or the
 
Governor.
 In the seventeen months that I have worked for the
 
Oregon Arts Commission,  there have been five major OAC-sponsored
 
folk art events,  four of them in the Salem-Portland area where
 
the largest group of you live.
 Five events times seven commis-
sioners means th
ty-five opportunities  for you to have not
 
only shown your support but to have talked with government
 
leaders about the arts in a positive atmosphere.
 Your batting
 
average is roughly one in thirty-five  (one of you came once).
 
I have to conclude that that is a true reflection of your concern
 
for folk art in Oregon.
 
FOLK ARTS RE
OBT
 3
 
I have found that in all these months of struggling for the
 
Folk Arts Program,  I have not honestly been able to reconcile
 
myself to itsfLoss.
 I cannot think of folk arts as an oDtion
  
of an arts  commission anymore than literature,  theater,  or
 
visual arts  could be  considered a pleasant ostion. 
Now a vast
 
number of Oregon 's greatest artists will be excluded.
 Our
 
conception of art is impoverished .
 We will no longer be enriched
 
by these artists,  and they will  not receive the small amount
 
of encouragement that has reached so  far since 1977.
 
This program made a difference.
 Most significantly,  it had
 
a positive effect on traditional artists and cultures in Oregon.
 
But great folk art endures in Oregon.
 That is clear.
 It
 
exists among people like the buckaroos of Eastern Oregon,
 
like the Hr
nong,  who endure.
 It will not die as long as there
 
are people who will not willingly let great art die.
 
Thank you,
