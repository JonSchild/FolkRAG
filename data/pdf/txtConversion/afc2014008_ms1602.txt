The difficulty is that the learning hypothesis fits the
 
culture pattern too well,  in a sense.
 A pragmatic society demands ever
 
C
 
more pragmatic results of its pragmatic professes; so if play is learning
 
and 1earri ng is the prime necessity for problem-solving,  then obviously,
 
(
luring the interminable crisis periods of our society ) one of our best
 
stra tagems would be to jack up that game-playing business a bit and
 
'
nake it produce faster results.
 
And so during the past twenty years, American society,
 
at least, has experienced an unparalleled amount of interference with
 
the afgxuld processes of play and game.
 Psychologists h invent (and
 
market) games for the more efficient working-through of conflict,
 
whole communities organize for the promotion of juvenile baseball or
 
football, mitixx military strategists work out imaginary campaigns on
 
huge electrified gameboards deep in the bowels of the Pentagon, and
 
before us all every Sunday afternoon our professional (
i.e. our most
 
efficient) athletes
 
their expertise in what has become one of
 
the nation's biggest businesses.
 Three years ago  at a conference ) I
 
heard the report of a sociologist concerning a game he had invented
 
to train civic leaders in the solution of city problems.
 Each member
 
of a city council, for example, would take the part of "real estate",
 
"heavy industry",  "the banks" and so forth and
 solemnly playing
 
)
 -f
 
for chips marked "money",  "power" and "
social prestige", tb W would
 
'ç work through on a gameboard a hypothetical solution to the
 
kXVaXkuXkmxI problem of where to erect the new waterworks.
 Given
 
the premise,  it's all very logical.
 
The cultural authority of the slognii: play is learning
 
I
 
is further demonstrated by the
 attempts of current
 
youth to oppose it.
 Kites, balloons,

,
 
on college campuses periodically,  together with a manifestoed determina-
tion to "play" and be "natural".
 But as one Jxhausted, barefooted,
 
during a LQ4a
.l  k c xk
 "be-in"
 
April-faced co-ed remarked to me/one afternoon,  "The thing is,  Mrs.  Hawes,
 
what do you 9 do after you blow up all those balloons?"
 
I really didn't know what to tell her.
 Flay, after all,
 
is something which is fun, which is delightful -
-
 not something you to
 
to havw fun or to produce delight.
 It is neither medicine, drug, nor
 
social panacea.
 Like virtue, play is its own reward, which is what
 
my young jump-roping friends have been trying to tell me all these years.
 
But simple hedonism is not enough; it has no staying-power) 
was discovering all by herself.
 
as my young co-ed acquaintance
 
kwf
fmx Is there no ground lying between "being good for something else"
 
and being "good for nothing in particular"?  Well, we could try -
-
 as
 
a number o f-
 
.
1  
-
 in the field have tried -
-
 looking at
 
-)lay as though it were good for itself, good on its own terms.
 We could
 
tL-
Tr y
 kind of formulation 
f
l that play is a cross-species,  pan-human,
 
;
elf-contained, self-rewarding behavioraly system which manifests itself
 
in as many forms and styles as any other behavioral system and which
 
locks neaciy into the social and physical environment in which it occurs.
 
This may ko seem pompous -
-
 and it is -
-
 but it is the kind of basic
 
formulation Xkak which biO4
ecologists have been using to great
 
advantage in recent years.
 
These disciplines, of course, have the enormous advantage
 
of having early characterized anthropomorphism as the original sin;
 
,
 
lacking this kkwaxmkkux1xxxPt
xk comparative theoretical tool
', behavioral
 
scientists on the whole have tended to adopt the simple and useful pro-
cedure of observing behavior as behavior with a minimum number of prior
 
postulations.

t lion cubs only play
 
when it is safe to play.
 Through the long day, while their parents are
 
away foraging,  the cubs lie-Motionless and hidden; when one or the other
 
parent returns,  they begin to roll and frisk.
 Play is not "natural"
 
nor "universal";  it takes place -
-
 like all behavior -
-
 within a larger
 
context, a fact so self-evident that it too often goes unmarked by
 
specialists in human play.

that teasing behavior may be a form of meta-play,  "because that with

The holistic view of play as a/behavioral system existent
 
within some kind of an environment
 has lat:elv been advanced
 
with increasing frequency by students of human behavior.
 \
 recent
 
example is Robert George's useful and thorough essay on "The Relevance
 
of Models for Analyses of Traditional Play Activities".
 1k  Like other
 
such rigorous attempts to codify the multiple factors involved in human
 
behavior,  the general impact of this essay on the reader is,  I
'm afraid,
 
to make him wish that he hadn't started out to think about games in the
 
first place.
 However, if Goerge's three page list of "postulations"
 
could be internalized by investigators as general principles -
-
 a sort
 
of structural framework -
-
 rather than as an exhausting checklist of
 
bings he ought to know or find out about,  the paper should have the
 
salutory effect the author intended.
 
A more appealing (possibly simply because less demanding)
 
t study has been published in a recent article titled "Games and Social
 
t
cter in a Mexican Village".
 This i
s one of the most inclusive and
 
_
_ted 
 
studies  I have read in the whole field,  and
 
interesting to speculate how much of its character is due to its
 
r
in
H ng  been part of a larger investigation undertaken by a whole team
 
of researchers.
 It contains not only a lively discussion of basic
 
theoretical problems, but a brief and pithy historical review of the
 
relevant socio-psychological factors of village life, a clear description
 
of the stNructural features of the play activities common to various
 
age and sex groupings and an evaluation of their function vis a vis the
 
reinforcement of social attitudes.

 Dundes has suggested that games may

ame kind of inter-locking relationship as that which exists between
 
1 and myth; Roberts and Sutton-Smith's findings concerning the
 
�Iel occurrence of the elemtn of strategy in games and folktaIes
 
e strengthened this thesis.
 All such investigations emphasize

 maybe.
 My own ten-
dency is to agree, but frankly,  in view of the cheerfully exploitative,
 
grand-scale problem-solving,  progress-oriented predilections of American
 
culture,  I find this a terrifying remark to make right out loud in
 
meeting, so to say.
 In terms of the possibilities for social disruption,
 
"play is learning" would have nothing on "play is a citure-changing
 
mechanism", it seems to me.

However, during this rapid over-view of the history of
 
play theory, one thing that has impressed me is the stability of the
 
mechanism itself.
 Play and game seem ka very parallel to oral tradition
 
in their :
kmVwxx essential imperviousness to outside interference or
 
manipulation.
 The folklorist has m seen during the twentieth century
 
that publication, widespread circulation and commercial exploitation

 And both play and game seem further protected by a kind

f walled-off quality essential to their very existence; play, indeed.
 
as Lateson pointed out both is and is not of its society.

 But I
 
do believe that all the theoretical positions I have outlined so

Apparently knoxxxo in trying to define such things1 we
 
are inclined, because of the necessity for parsimony of
 
expination,  to say that it is this but not that, one thing
 
and not another; however,  parsimony,  in nature,  is probably
 
quite a different thing.
 In a complicated act like the
 
"ecstatic display",I would think, nature has condensed
  
any number of highly important messages, rather than
 
selected one over other....  I would seek for overdeterrninatio 
here and a certain richness which looks almost unnecessary
 
ntil you realize that each element condensed in it stands
 
or an absolutely necessary communication.
 
..All of this is true for our most important ceremonies
 
i
d rituals, and I would think this display is analogous
 
o that kind of display which we call a ritual in our world
 
where tradition kakox sees to such performances.
 Rituals
 
and ceremonies,  too, often seem overloaded and "unnecessary'
 
but in certain important functions in nature and society,
 
it is most parsimonious to put just enough reassurance
 
into an act, for just enough would be too little for a
 
mutual pact.
 There has to be an extra margin for faith,
 
delight or ecstacy...

 Hypothesis:
 
that first-borns generalize to their play with friends relation

o tue effect that "the function of a proverb is to subsume the particular
 
a
cler the general".
 The statement interested me at the time primar11v
 
ecause it suggested a reason for the declining frequency in the use, of
 
recent years.
 I recall, for example,
 
that is, as comments on my conduct;
 
own children, however, have always shown a definite dislike of an
 
tempts to apply proverbial statements to them.
 In the light of t
-he
 
ur
nark quoted above,  they were objecting to being "
subsumed under t

At face value,  these are all extraordinarily particular s

on how many occasions during a normal lifetime any of the above remarks

In other words, one could say,  "A rolling stone gathers no
 
moss" under almost any set of circumstances except in either a geolomv
 
or a botany class.
 And one of my sister-in-law's favorite stories is
 
sharing ak hospital room with a Bronx housewife who had just under onn
 
long-delayed operation for varicose veins.
 The lady remarked dolefully

(
)rninO:  "The doctor kept telling me I ought to have the operation befor
 
1mo : '
ot too bad but I didn't want to take the time; and so now I jus
 
teep thinking of what my mother1 used to tell me: a stitch in time saves
 
r-- t
 
nine!"  The humor of the lady's statement lies in the incongr uity of
 
her use of a proverb referring to stitching in XkuxmwxkwxX in a context
 
i
ri which stitching had actually been 46mmo and you just: dot'

Upon reflection, one clear difference that appears betweer
 
such statements  (which, for convenience,  I will call aphorisms) and the
 
ones cited previously (metaphoric or true proverbs) is that they are
 
less particular, less specific in texts.
 (Stylistically,  the infrequent-
use of concrete nouns in the pk aphorisms may prove to be a distinctiv('
 
feat-ure.)  A second difference is that the aphorisms are generally used
 
in the contexts to which their texts refer.
 One is most likely, for example,
 
to be discussing the conclusion of something if one is to use "
All's we U
 
that ends well" appropriately, f
xam
. 
Thus Bascom see
bms
 to be
 
riaht;  the extreme specificity of the true proverb allows it to be more
 
'v f
lT f
l11rid  than the more general 
mark: a very neat para(ioY.

-
 
that the aphorism subsumes the particular under the genern ,

but the proverb both subsumes the particular under the general and the
 
peneral under the particular simultaneously.
 Or to put it another way:
 
rh O  aphorism is a general statement which sums up a
. particular situation.
 
e proverb is a particular statement suggesting a general

sums up any number of particular situations all different from the ori

In XmxmsxmfxXkm structural terms, it seems to me that: these
 
texts are roughly parallel with those cited earlier.

a lot more texts,  I think,  to be sure of what you're taling about.)

There are, however, some differences between the latter group
 
of texts (wHich, for conve ience,  I will call "aphorisms") and the earlier
 
group (true or metaphoric proverbs).
 For one thing, aphorisms are far

In Niddle Ages, modern European languages
 regarded as degraded classic
 
1an:uages.  As a result explorers were not well equipped to learn the
 
languag s they found.  Spanish colonizers tried to learn and use nati
 
uag s, but tried t
o fit them into Latin grammatical constructions.

There are rules which govern which of the above three are used.
 The " s

occurs when the sound preceding is  vvirIn voiceless (the vocal chords ar'
 
not vibrating).
 ( " v"  and "
f" are paired sounds -

 you vibbate with "v"
 
and you don't with "f"; "
s" and "

a

ending, which is voiced occurs after sounds which are voiced.  The nouns
 
to which the "es --(special phonetic symbol used here) see class notes)
 
is added are a special group -

t the oost resioirsble airoscL
 
is to view language as one kind of communication.
 de ask: what is it Lhnt
 
i
iakes human language different from communication systems used by other
 
organisms, and what kind of capabilities must the human being develon to
 
enable it to communicate in these snecial ways.  Going at the nroblem thin
 
way, we can come up with some
 
he topic then, is actually:  ti:"
i
e
 ty '  c  co  eeic tioo.
 
Language is a means of communication.
 Communicative behavior is any kinr
 
oE behavior by which one organism trigg ers an acti on  on  th e nar
t of anot
h r 
organism.
 (One species of male fish develop red marks on the side whn o
 
they are in season; the fema
fish then lays eggs.  This association i
 
similar to language because it is  x it xy arbitrary -
-
 there jn  no ofv:H o
 
connection between the two behaviors and the sippmw  symbol.
 
Bees tansrnit information about the direction and distance and th.  L

 the bees dance.  This is a more
 
complicated system of communication; ther e is ar bitrar

(This alone is not enough to di

2
)  Interchangability. That is, every organism can be either

3) Speciali7ation. The organism has some organic part that i

A single indiqidual will use one variety of his language o i
 
another on another occasion.  These are not random but socially definabl .
 
Recent linguistic studies have tended to ignore these distinctions and d
 
cribe large units as though they were one single system with occasional vir
 
ants.
 These they described as "being in free variation"; actually th i  r-
mapDable.
 The choice between pronunciations "bird" and "boyd" has so
 
to do with social class and something to do with the social situatio .
 
Further, these variations can tell us something about the way the lan .
 
is moving or develo ing.
 In the term "bird", both in the south and in
 
there is a fluctuation between the pronunciations "bird" and
 "buhd".

The definitions of T and V (

their interrelationships have changed through time, as Brown and GilLuan bu y

His point was that in

 on the other hand the difference betwee

 It is a soci
 
fact telling you something about social and linguistic processes; for c-'
 
that Anglos may be the vectors through which Spanish words came into t

In some parts of the world people use two different languages in variou
 
situations: one will be especiallyfo , though not exclusively, for fe':

Notes from beginning of previous lecture (on creole etc.)
 
Pat
s =  dialect of a standard language used locally
 
Jargon =  non-standard variety of speech
 
Pidgin: typically has origin from two or more languages wit -
-
 vocabul-
ary may be a mostly from one language and grammar is likely to be sim-
pler than any of the contributing languages.
 
it is a language which is secondary in function;  it is nobody's
 
native language but is one used as a second language.
 
Lingua franca =  term used to describe language used between peoples of
 
different language areas (e.g. English in India)
 
Sometimes pidgin gets so popular it replaces a native language.  A child
 
then may grow up using only pidgin; when this happens with a whole gene-
ration the language doesn't fit the definition of pidgin and the word
 
creole is used,
 Creole =  a native tongue.
 
English borrowed the word creole from French, and French from Spanish
 
or Portugese (Criollo); the term is applied to people with origins in
 
the old world transplanted to the new.
 In speech it refers to French
 
based speech spoke# or used by Negroes.  So Creoles do not speak Creole.
 
Krio =  African and French or English (Sierra Leone, Haiti) -
-
 mainly
 
European vocabulary but a xm simpler grammar than either French or
 
Spanish.

P
here is nothing to prevent a language orginat'
 I
 
creole from "making it", achieving status of a world languaga.
 The nc
 
case to this is Swahili  which is a Bantu language.
 The most s
trik
 
hing about Swahili i
s that all the Bantu languages arc tone langua
 
xce-)t Swahili.
 Swahili has been used as a trade languages between
 
Fricans and Arabs (and also with Europeans today) as long as we kc
 
nything about it.
 There are lots of Arabic loan words -
-
 also uni'
 
her Bantu languages.
 Sahili  then  probably comes to close to h
.cr
 
c origin like that outlined before.  As a trade language it has two
 
:
riginal tongues; when it became a Creole language  people speak it
 
:
L

Jly language they know.
 (It has now become the official language
 
c

Last lecture:
 Historical linguistics
 
What kinds of methodologies does a linguist use in order to arrive at
 
reasonable conclusions about prehistoric events?
 
Historical linguistics is the study of languages changing through time.
 
We have records of English for close to 2000 years:  semantic systems,
 
pronunciations etc.  We have information on the historical development
 
of Chinese and Sanskrit into Indian languages.  By aeeparison study,
 
we ]
:am learn that some types of chang.s are more frequent than others.
 
Analogical changes are likely (a child saying
I
f
 I catched rather than
 
"
I caught )
 
Our basic information comes from languages that have a record of written
 
history.  Suppose we look at non-written languages or ancient languages
 
such as Aztec.  What might be their earlier history?  We can make educa-
ted guesses:  if we see ± that in the known history of English and other
 
recorded languages it is typical for a known x to change into y and we
 
look at Aztec and find that it has y, then we can make a reasonable in-
ference that an unknown x preceeded y in Aztec.
 
Some languages have nazalixed a vowels (French -
-
 also Portugese, Polish
 
and some North Indian languages).
 In case of languages with known his-
tory, we can see that nazalized vowels come from an earlier sequence of
 
a vowel followed by a nazalized ax consonant:  an leads to nazalized a.
 
When we have written evidence of nazalized vowels, we find this situa-
tion, so we can hypothesize a historical parallel.
 In historic recon-
structions, we generalize backwards, from known recorded language history.
 
Another observation is that a language splits up into several other
 
languages: Latin into French, Roumanian, Spanish etc.  With the breakup of
 
Roman political empire, communication became less frequent, contact with
 
the attacking barbarian tribes (speaking different languages) became
 
more frequent, resulting in the development of divergent types of lan-
guages in Spain, France etc.  At first you could speak of a French dia-
lect of Latin etc.  but after some centuries what was originally a local
 
dialect developed into a new language.  However, the daughter of a single
 
mother language continues to show a biological similarity; and this is
 
a characteristic of splitting up languages.
 
On this basis we can speak of linguistic families, and draw family trees:
 
__--- -, Latin
 -
_
 
Spanish
 French
 Italian
 kumanian
 
Fhe common origins is shown on the basis of similarities between the
 
laughter languages.  This idea can be applied to nonwritten languages.
 
e can say these languages show similarities which cannot be result of
 
sheer chance -
-
 they are d
ter-sister languages.  Working with North
 
American  Indian languages, we can hypothesize a mother =  Proto Uto-
Aztecan and therefore we can make some suggestions (guesses) about when
 
Proto-Uto-Aztecan was spoken and where.

A few warnings about this method (comparative similarity):
 
Sometimes the conclusion that similar languages are related is false
 
because there are some similarities that are not the result of common
 
origin.  The Malayan word for eye = mata
 
The Greek word for eye
 = mati
 
The Greek word in an earlier time was opmation (op-met-io-n is the way
 
it breaks down by root t stems).
 "Op" is the stem connected with the
 
term " t o
 see".  Historically1(
an equivalent way back,)the Malayan word
 
for eye was always "mata".  This is an accidental resemblance; these
 
occur reasonably often but within many languages.  There are xn only
 
so many sounds any human tongue can make; accidental similarities may
 
perhaps be as many as 3 or 4%.
 
Other similarities which must be watched for (and are not due to an his-
torical inter-relationship).  Mama and Papa occur in a startling number
 
of languages with their meanings as in English.  Maybe all languages are
 
related but the techniques of historical linguistics don't go that far
 
back.  However, babies start working on lip control very early (they
 
need this for sucking) and mmmnun sound results.  The first dk kinds of
 
sounds that an infant is physically capable of making have been taken
 
by adults in many cultures to refer to themselves.  A similar non-histori-
cal similarity concerns names of animals which are onomatopoe
 sounds

More important and more troublesKome to historical linguistic theory
 
are borrowed words (which do not prove historical relationship in spite
 
of similarity.)  All languages kmwborrow -
-
 sometimes grammar, pronunci-
ation etc.
 If two languages borrow from each other a great deal, they
 
may turn out to resemble each other to a startling degree.
 
he Dravidian languages of south Indian consist of a family present in
 
rhat area prior to Indo-European.  Dravidian has borrowed extensively
 
from Indo-European and therefore the vocabulary of Sanskrit or modern
 
i
ndian languages descended from Sanskrit plus Dravidian show an enormous
 
i
umber of similarities.  You would be tempted to say that Dravidian comes
 
rom Sanskrit.  However, this is not true.  Tamil (a Dravidian language)
 
and Sanskrit are not related in the same way that English and Sanskrit
 
are related.  Sanskrit and English come from an ancient common language.
 
Tamil is a mx more
 How do we decide that the two are not
 
related as above if we don't know the language history (as with primitive
 
languages ?
 
Some rules of thumb in trying to decide whether two languages are related
 
as sisters or by borrowing:
 
1
)  One fact that we know from recorded languages is that imma
±Azt
 
awwm borrowing often affects vocabulary, less often pronunciation, and
 
least often grammar.  Languages rarely borrow important grammatical
 
constructions or principles.  Tamil grammar is substantially different
 
from Sanskrit.
 
2)  Some types of vocabulary are easily borrowed and some types are
 
not.  We can distinguish cultural vocabulary from non-cultural (or basic)
 
vocabulary.  Cultural means those words which are peculiar to an one cul-
ture and its institutions.  Bicycle = cultural word in English.  Non-
cultural vocabulary would comprehend t
xx terms referring to those ac-
tions, objects and attitudes common to or universal to all humans: body
 
parts, natural objects of all climates, kingship terms of a basic sort,
 
actions performed by all humans -
-
 walking  running etc, numerals at
 
32
 
least up to one and two.
 In general when borrowing occurs, borrowing
 
tends to be of cultural vocabulary.  Dravidian languages k xw borrow
 
from Sanskrit in terms of Hindu philosophy -
-
 guru for teacher -
-
the caste system terms, religious concepts etc., but they do not borrow
 
non-cultural terms.
 
(One surprising thing that occurs in a specific body of loan words
 
borrowed by Dravidian languages from Sanskrit -
-
 they borrow such terms
 
as husband, wife, man, woman, sun, moon, stars -
-
 words for which there
 
must have been Dravidian words before Sanskrit influence was felt.  This
 
is startling and unusual.
 In this case, the words have a religious con-
text in the Hindu religion.  Hindu is a very all-pervasive religion -
-
in India no aspect of life is untouched by religion.  This possibly ex-
plains this unexpected linguistic borrowing:  sun and moon are deities;
 
men, women, husbands, wives are roles within religious life.  The moral
 
is that there are no hard and fast categories; things are relatively
 
cultural or relatively non-cultural and you have to say "more likely"
 
and such phrases when discussing this.  There are no real absolutes in
 
this area; these concepts are rough guides.
 
When you find many cultural borrowed terms iii you can guess borro-
wing rather than a similar ancestral point.
 If we counted up the terms
 
in and English dictionary more words are like French than like German.
 
But we say English is a Germanic language, not a Romance language.  Englis
 
and German grammar are more similar than English and French; further,
 
to look at the nature of the loan vocabularies, the similarities between
 
English and French are cultural terms.
 In the basic English vocabulary
 
there is a high similarity with German vocabulary; words for kinship,
 
animals, body parts etc. show greater closeness with German than with
 
'
rench.

One suggestion is that English may be a mixed language from Latin and
 
ermanic.
 (Haitian Creole has French and West African elements fused.
 
ere both cultural and non-cultural vocabular* is French but the grammar
 
s most comparable to West African.  This is a unique ziMmastan type of
 
ituation.  Here you have a fusion of two branches (crossing back over
 
he family tree -
-
 at least this can be argued.  The existence of Creole
 
really plays hob with the whole idea of genetic classification of lan-
guage.  How do you know that an American Indian language wasn't a creole
 
a thousand years or so ago?
 
The socio-linguistic factors that bring creole languages into existence
 
are special.  Creole language s are being developed in Africa and other
 
places in the world right now.  Creole languages arise out of pidgin
 
languages when they become the native language;and as they grow in pres-
tige, they may become national languages.
 In Surimam (Dutch Guiana)
 
there is a very mixed population: Negro-Indian-European.  The language
 
that most of the Negro population (the largest group) speaks is Sranen,
 
an English-based Creole.  Vocabulary is based on English; grammar is very
 
African with lots of loan words from Spanish, Dutch, Portugese.  The offi-
cial language has long been Dutch, the language of educated people, and
 
Sranen had little or no prestige.  Poets recently writing in Sranen have
 
raised the standard of prestige of Sranen.
 In less than five years after
 
the publication of the first book of poems in Sranen the language has be-
come respectable if not prestigeous.

Historical linguisticsa and culture history.
 
Edward Sa ir  -
 1916 -
 Time Perspective in Aboriginal American Culture:
 
A Study in Method -
 discusses different ways in which linguistic data
 
can be used to guess at unwritten history.
 
e.g. place names and territory.
 In California many names are borrowings
 
from Spanish and Indian.  Of those which are in English, many are place
 
names either of obvious meaning (Salt Lick) or are bovrowed from for-
mer locations of the speakers.
 If you look
 za gk at an area like
 
Eng]
..nd though, place names go back beyond written history and have no
 
obvious etymology.  London
 "mean" anything.  When you find the
 
place names are obvious, the area has probably not been settled very
 
long by the people who are giving the names (and the other way round).
 
As applied to attempts to reconstruct worth American Indian culture
 
history, Sapir mentions that Mt. Shasta is named by all local Indian
 
tribes who can see it.  Certain tribes have names like "Big White
 
Mountain" and others have unanalyzable names; the latter are likely to
 
have been in that area quite a while.  This is an hypothesis and may
 
not work i
ixax 100% of the time.
 
Another Sapir suggestion.  Suppose there is a language with dialects
 
and the dialects get out of touch and begin to coalesce into new lan-
guages.  This is happenèng all the time.
 If you have daughter lan-
guages with a high degree of similar covabularies they probably branched
 
off from the parent languages at a later date than languages which have
 
dissimilar vocabularies.

Morris Swadesh attempted to formalize this notion.
 Inv nted lexico-
statistics and glottochronology (slightly different but same thing for
 
purposes of this discussion).
 In this he compared the vocabularies of
 
various languages with the aim of trying to estimate the period of
 
time when languages branched out from parent stock.
 (A good article
 
on this is the ABC's of Lexico-Statistics).  The formula Swadesh arrived
 
at for calculating the time depth of linguistic divergence is:
 
log C (% of shared words betwee
 
t (length of time in lOOs of yrs) =
 2 langs. in a basic mm m
 
vocab. list 
2 log r  (constant*  .
805)
 
There has been an immense amount of argument over whether or not this
 
works; violent controversy.  Bright says he
 think it wor 1s at
 
all.  Swadesh makes certain basic assumptions:
 
1
)
 
chat we can definitely specify what constitutes basic
 
vocabulary -
- Lthat which is not subject to borrowing'because borrowing
 
would throw the whole thing off.  Twelve out of Swadesh's 200 words in
 
his basic vocabulary list turn out to be those which Dravidian has bor-
rowed from Sanskrit,
 
2)
 that the turnover in a basic vocabulary (if there is such
 
a thing) is constant throughout time and in any single language.  But
 
languages chan,
.e due to many factors as well as  by borrow
ing.  '
Meat
 for  
instance used to mean food.
 In every language there is going on a
 
4
 
turnover -
-
 old words dropped out and new ones coming in.  Glocto-
chronology requires the assumption that the rate of turnover is
 
always the same -
-
 that is what the figure .805 stands for.
 It
 
says that 80% of a language within a thousand year span should be
 
maintained and 20% should change.
 If there is such a thing as a
 
basic vocabulary.  There may be certain kinds of historical acci-
dents which speed up or ritard the rate of change -
-
 the Norman m
ck
 
invasion of England probably speeded up the acceptance of french
 
loan words into English.  The Icelandic language (Iceland being
 
isolated geographically and culturally) shows a very slow rate of
 
turnover.
 
3)  This rate of preservation or turnover is not only the same
 
at all times but is the same for all languages (Icelandic example
 
goes here.)  This assumes that English and Hopi have the same rate
 
of turnover linguistically, though their cultures are quite differ-
ent in their rate of change in nonlinguistic behavior.
 
Another use of linguistic data is discussed by Romney.
 It is often
 
called "Worter-und Sacher method -
-
 the words and things method.
 
It is based on the assumption that we can reconstruct ix proto-
languages from the daughter languages and from the reconstructed vo-
cabularies we can infer certain non-linguistic facts.
 If the people
 
had a word for the thing, then they must have had the thing.  The
 
difficulty is to be certain you reconstruct the language correctly.
 
Taking the group of North American Indian languages, most have a
 
word for metate.  The Aztec word is mal at  metlati,  Hopi, Piaute
 
etc. (all Uto-Aztecan) all have a word for this object and a similar-
ly constructed word; therefore we can assume that Proto-Uto-Aztecan
 
had a word for metate and the word can be reconstructed as metet.
 
-i
erefore Proto-Uto-Aztecan peoples had a grinder and some kind of
 
rinding culture.  This must be correlated with oth 
ft
r cultural data.
 
in Proto-Algonkian, you can reconstruct a proto-word for gun.  Ob-
viously this is not an ancient word or tool.  But all Algonkian lan-
c
zuages have a mnxd similar word for gun; the difference is that these
 
words can be broken down into stems which mean something like something
 
to shoot with.  Metate can not be broken down meaningfully.
 
People who have used this system (words and things) have tried to use
 
it as a method for reconstructing wkRkRz where peoples have migrated
 
to or from.  But it rarely works out with all of a language group
 
having the same term and the same object; there will usually be some
 
tribe which messes up the corre'ations.  By choosing salmon and beech
 
trees Paul Themie (
'?) in lazingv*m Scientific American article tried
 
to locate home of 1xdwx2xxmVvxxx Proto-Indo-European somewhere in
 
Poland.  This is debatable -
-
 especially the salmoni  Aboriginal home-
land is more likely the Ukraine, but his demonstratipn of the method
 
is good.
