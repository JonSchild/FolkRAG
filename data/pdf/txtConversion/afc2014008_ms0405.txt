Deer Ms. Caberas:
 
Concerning Folk Arts grant R70-54-1391K, this letter in to
 
notify you that Folk Arts has shifted the estimated fee for
 
the anthropologist (
$509) from the salaries and Wages
 
section of the grant into the "Other" sectio n of the
 
original grant application budget, where it probably should
 
have been all along. The total project budget remains the
 
saNe.
 
We da not require a revised budget for this action, since the
 
amount concerned stays well with&n our allowed 25% line
 
item change.  The remaining $5,600 in the "Oth4w" section
 
can then be reassigned to the anthrop3logist'a fee, again
 
without a revised budget having to be s4baitted.
 
This creative bureaucratic ma neuver was developed by Martha
 
Kuenhold , our Folk Arts grant* officers its propriety has
 
been checked with all interested parties, the Grants office s 
the Media Program and others.  I
t allo w us all to get c
an
 
with the work at nand without producing another ream o
f
 
paper to rest in the federal files for all eternity.  Please
 
be assured that you can proceed on the basis of this letter.
 
Since no b
=adgeet action is necessary, the Grants office will
 
not be writing you further on this topic.
 
With bes
et wishes fax the halid

The latter organization has taken over the international

their Imports rather than their expor+ activities at the
 
�
ro —
sr:t, but their charge is to handle prajects going bath
 
wa ys , and they may be further along in their total program
 
than I realize.
 
As far an the National ZadownOnt for the Arts goes, we handle
 
very few international projects , and give na grants at all
 
for overseas travel.  Should you at same point want to edit
 
an album for distributian in the united States for the
 
benefit of Bulgarian-Americans and interested musicians, you
 
could apply to the Folk Arta Programs for help with the
 
research and album booklet part of the project.  I
'll enclose
 
a
t copy of our program leaflet that describes the process.
 
As far as archiving your tapes properly, the logical places,
 
I suppose , are the Ar chive of American Folk Song at the
 
Library of Cangaesa o or the Sthaolagical Music Archives at

Dear A len:
 
Roger was a bit optimistic and also was confusing two things.
 
Ne have: had m e meeting t
:> attempt to come up with a list of
 
ru pirem ate we should lay )o applicants who want money fox
 
fiIA/video projects, and two meetings to try to arrive at a
 
sima
.lar list for people who want funding to get out record
 
albuma¢ and neither have produced more than minutes.
 I shall
 
encloses x
aeroxes of the minutes for whatever help they might
 
be, but the general conclusion of every one of the sessions
 
was that local conditioner so affected the projects that each
 
application should be examined on its a
men particular merits
 
mid within its own particular content.
 
Fred is now warring from a different angle -- trying to
 
develop s
rAw aide that would help people inexperienced with
 
videotape and sound recording from the technical point of
 
view.
 f
ie is planning a sample videotape that will show the
 
effects obtainable from various shooting angles and the line,
 
as well as t  3oms, fast-cutting and other devices beloved of
 
amateur filmma'cers.  He further intends to produce an audio
 
tape which will demonstrate aurally what happens when you use
 
a
. whole range of mike
s set-ups to record a series of musical
 
situations frequently run into in the U.S. -- solo via* with
 
guitar, M all string group, unaccompanied vocal choir, etc.
 
The idea behind these productions is to give people a quick
 
look-heat at a variety of ways in which action can be
 
recorded, so that they can make mare educated choices in
 
doing their own projects.
 It is not going to say there is a
 
- 2 -
 
right jr a wrong way -- just present a number of possibilities.
 
our intention is to send these sample productions out on loan
 
to groups that want to see or listed to them, especially to
 
grantees who seem to have had little audio-visual experience.
 
Anyway, they are still in progress, and still being argued
 
over.  I'll certainly let you know if and when they become
 
available.
 
I hops some of this will prove useful to you.  BY the Way,
 
we're planning a state folklorist get-togetbes at the LibX*Xy
 
of Congress &a m time during March, probably.  Soo
 of those
 
folks may have material m
:.
ire closely fitting your needsi Tin
 
Lloyd. I know, has drawn up a series of release forms that
 
he's using in Ohio.  you might want to drop him a .
line,
 
although I willl certainly ask him to bring copies along to
 
the VAOting.  j
ail be writing you soon with more information
 
on the latter topics Alan Jabbour is 3n vacation, and that's
 
slowed down the planning.

Dear >ia Boynton:
 
I like your idea very much.
 I us " to knOW Li1Y MAY well,
 
and admire bar music enormously.
 
I don't see why we can't work something out with this pro-
ject.  There Ls a snag or two: pritsarily the fact that we
 
don't give individual
. grants.  Still and all, we should be
 
able to find a sponsoring organization that could act as
 
fiscal agent for the project without too much trouble.
 
I'm enclosing a copy of the Folk Arts brochure and deadliness
 
for the coming year, so you can get an ideas of the time
 
flour.  You might also think about applying to the Hamanities
 
adoaseMast for a Youth Grant (assuming that you are under the
 
age of thirty; after that, in Youth Grant to =*, you're over

meat for the l
wamenities, 806-15th Street, N.w., Washington,

In the granting business, it never hurts to have mare than
 
one string to your bow.
 
Maybe you should
 c
came down to Washington at some point, so
 
that we can talk, and so that you can take a look at what IS
 
available in the Folk Song Archive.  You might also, while

Dear Dr. Murphy,
 
Thank you for youz letter.  I as enclosing a copy of the Folk
 
Arts guidelines for your use= you will notice that it con-
tains three copies �
>
f our application form.
 
Concerning your propasal to do a film on Doc and Merle
 
Watson, certainly the topic falls within our guidelines.  I
 
must tell you, however, that our paned has become increasingly
 
more conservative about files funding, since we have such a
 
small budget and films can easily,  :
f not checked, eat up
 
any amount of available monies.
 
However, should you decide to apply, please note that we will
 
need a number of supporting materials  vita* of all the
 
principal people to be working on the film  a suggested film
 
treatments a film distribu.
tian plan ; and a ten minute sample
 
of film produced by the individuals who will be technically
 
and artistically r
esponsible for your p
roject.  Theses
 
materials can c me in after the application reaches us, but
 
shauld be submitted by the and of January.
 
Finally, I wonder if you are aware that the B.H.C. produced
 
a film on Doc and Merle that covers substantially the topics
 
you intend to film?  it was made im 1
.975 by film producer
 
Barry Gavin and scholar A. L. Lloyd and resulted in a half-
hour (or perhaps it was as hour?) special that was sh orn
 
extensively on the B.B.C.  Ralph Rin7lor of the Folklile
 
Centex at the Swith*onian institute has a copy, I believer
 
he also told me today that the out-takes arse stored at the
 
Smithsonian's Ethnographic Film ArWhive.  I expect that a
 
letter from you to Barry Gavin at the S.B.C. could g
ent you
 
access to those materials , should you want to use them.

Dear Sr. Villalobos:
 
Thank you for your letter.
 
I a
sp
► encl3sing for your information a copy of the brochure
 
that explains the Folk Arta Program.  Please read it care-
fully.
 
The Folk Arta Program is the smallest in the entire Arts
 
E
ft; therefore we have selected only a small part of
 
all the g
rinds of activities that could be described as folk
 
arts as our particular funding target . The development of
 
folk art 4-H clubs would not seem to me to be incladed is
 
the kinds of projects we can supaort under tho..
-e guidelines.
 
in general , our x
 e
rviewing aanel has funded small, highly
 
focused projectat we have no monies for general organizational
 
deve

It .
occurs to me that you might wish to write
s the 3xpansion
 
Arts prog
ram of the national Endowment for direct information
 
on their program activity . I bolieve they have occasionally
 
provided organizational support a
aaaims, especially for inner-
city cultural organizations.  Perhaps you would qualify under
 
their guidelines.
 
I as sorry to sound so discouraging . Perhaps as y
.au read
 
through our brochure, you wil)
. think of projects that c
.
tuld
 
be aided by Folk Arts . in that case, we would be happy to

Dear Dr. Mart :
i

Thank you for your letter.
 I enclose a copy of the Folk Arts
 
guidelines f
 :
ar your use.  You will notice it contains copies
 
of x=  application form, should you decide to apply to this
 
program for funding.
 
my principal reaction to your proposed project is that it is
 
extremely expensive.
 I wo Weer if there is not a cheaper way
 
to attain your ends.
 I also
: wonder about what the reaction
 
might be to this project from the various Indian tribes in
 
Louisiana.  The Brack Indians have essentially reinterpreted
 
Indian culture in a Caribbean style, and I should think that
 
s
,Aae of the Louisiana tribes might be sensitive to this pre-
sentation unless that point war made c
ampleSely c
lear i
n the
 
educational part of the presentation.
 
Please understand that theses are simply personal roact.ions t
 
our advisory panel reviews all applications without benefit
 
of any reactions from me, and their decision is reached
 
quite independently.  Should you decide to apply, though, I
 
think I might touch on the above two points in your formal
 
application.
 
You should also bear 3
.n I nd that the panel e
oa miaee all
 
applications with great care and wants to know a lot of
 
detail.  Don't be inhibited by the s mll apace allowed for
 
a brief description of the projectr you can add on any
 
amount of additional information.  You g
rill also need to bs
 
specific about your match.  As you know, the An :
.wment

generally funds only 50% of the total cost of a project.

rcaUS  of their high cast and because the results, unless

Dear Ms. Tons
 ing
 s
 
Thant you for your letter of inquiry.  Z an enclosing the Folk
 
Arts program guidelines for your use.  Should you decide to
 
apply to our program, please return three copies of b
are applica-
tion blank which you will find inside the guidelines.  one of
 
the copies should be in the original typescript, and contain
 
original signatures in ink= the other two may be carbons or
 
xeroxes.
 
I would suggest that you read the general program information
 
contained in the guidelines very thoroughly.  You will notice
 
that the ft1k Arts Program l
imits its support strictly to the
 
most traditional artists within a comm unity.  We do not fund
 
.
large c
r  unity-based f
+estivalst xopmosts for such activities
 
s
kum
 ld go to the U pansion Arts Psogras
e at the Arts Bndowsmot .
 
I should warn you further that first-timo-ever funding is very
 
diffieutt to mane by.  Very few programmes within the Endowment
 
will accept applications to initiate particular activity of
 
this kind.
 
It is difficult for se to tell from your letter, but I wonder
 
if you are really ready to come in with a complete plan?  in
 
that case, you would be well advised to delay your application
 
until our next deadline, April 1.  I an sorry to sound discoura g-
ing, but our advisory panel would requixe a groat deal of
 
back--up information:  for example, stat
us fAM the community
 
cat& Ws that you intend to involve as well as the community
 
colleges, lists of performers and traditional activities you
 
intend to promot e vitas of the people who will be responsible
 
-2-
for  the program, names and vitas of any folklore consultants
 
you intend to use, and the like.  This may sound bureaucrati-
cally picky, but the fact is that the Polk Arts Program is the
 
smallest in the entire Endomment, and we simply have to extremely
 
careful with our funding.
 
Let me make a suggestion.  There is a young folklorist in your
 
area named Charles Seeman who works for the National Park Service
 
at Port Mason.  He can be reached at 845/482-3732 or 526-2666.
 
I am sure if you gave him a call, he could help you understand
 
the exact limitations of our program, and he could probably
 
give you helpful advi ce in figuring out your own plane and
 
needs.  Be's an extremely experienced festival manager.
 
I hope you fired the above information helpful and not over-
whelming.  I'm an Old Girl Scout myself, so my heart is with
 
you, but my head tells me you're biting off a big chunk.  Please
 
don't hesitate to write again if I can be of further helpe or
 
you can call me person-to-parson collect at 242/634-4282 and
 
I will return your call on the federal line.

Dear Me. Van Gheluwe:
 
Thank you for your letter of enquiry.  I am enclosing for your use
 
a copy of the folk Arts guidelines, which contain application
 
blanks.  Should you decide to apply to our program, please
 
return three copies of the application, one of wh
.fhh should be in
 
the original twypescript and contain original signatures in ink;
 
the other two may be xeroxes or barbons.
 
& wever, before you start filling in the forms, I think you
 
should read the preliminary infoxnatios carefully.  I an not at
 
all sure that most of your needs are possible for us to weet.
 
In the first place, we rarely take an costs for structures,
 
eves temporary 1 0
1  of the type you describe.  The hot air
 
balloon, though a charming idea, alas does not fit into our
 
guidelines.  The only area I can see that we might be able to
 
help you with is your musical entertainment, and that would have
 
to be entirely traditional.
 
The is a young folklorist at Bloomingb ", Indiana, who was an
 
intern for our program last year, who might be able to nest
 
with you to explain our policies in more detail.  His &
owe is
 
Sandy Rikoon, and he can be reached at 81 2/33
7-3652.  Se•s an
 
awfully nice fellow, and I an sure would be glad to advise you,
 
at least by phone.
 
Have you thought of applying to your state arts council for
 
assistance?  Expenses of this kind are most often met on the
 
local level.  In case it hasn't occurred to you to try before,
 
-2-
yon could drop a line to:

I an sorry to sound discouraging, but from your letter, it
 
doesn't sound to me as though we c
ould absorb many of your
 
costs.  We are the smallest program in they Endowment and must
 
husband our funds carefully) that is why our guidelines are
 
so rigid.
 
Let me, however, wish you the best of success with your m xt
 
festival.  it sounds like an awful lot of fun.

Dear Mr. Wiggins s
 
I wish I know bow to help you.  The problem of publication sub-
vention is a serious one, and I know of no public or private
 
funding agancy that is taking it on.  You might crop a line to
 
Kenny Gollistein at the University of Pennsylvania.  This is his
 
particular area of interest, as you know, and he just might
 
have hoard of something that I haven't.
 
The National Endowment for the u
nities is now offering
 
subvention moneys, but only for projects that have resulted
 
from research that they fu
 d od.  If they indeed helped you with
 
Fiddlin' John Carson, you sb mld certainly get in touch with
 
them
e -- but I doubt thay didt
 
one last rather hopeless suggestions  write Bill
. Ivey at the
 
Country Music Hall of P
lume.  They're doing a bit of publication,
 
and, again might know of other possibilities.  But I suppose
 
you've thbought of that already.
 
Anyway, let so wish you the best in your project.  Goad wis ps
 
don't take the place of hard cash, I know, but I
'll certainly
 
keep my ears open sor a more tangible fo m of support.

I M  sorry abo ut the coafuaion

the Sadowment during a trssaition period, when the Folk Music
 
Program was bring transferred freer the Music program to the

deadline for letters of intent, sot applications.
 
Z as encl.>zing for your information a copy of the Folk Arts
 
goAdelines.  The last folk music deadline has inde W passed.
 
I as presently working on 1980 Folk Arts/*Aaic guidelines
 
which will combine the two programs, and tban matters abould
 
be clearer.
 
Under Folk Arts during the
y calendar year 1979, you may apply
 
January 1
, April 1
, or Octobex I for regular program support.
 
us will accept a few applicati me July 1
. but only for

Perhaps you would g
rant to write again explaining more

led a few

Dear xr. 6eoffrioas
 
Shank you for your letter of inquiry.  I enclose for your use a
 
copy of the Folk Arts goidelines.  you will find that they
 
include blank copies of our application for s. Please return
 
three copies, if you should decide to apply to us.  one of the
:
 
copies should be in the original typescript and contain signa-
tures in inks the other two can be xeroxes or carbons.
 
Before you start filling in the fosse. bvrlvsr, I should tell
 
you that our advisory pamml has tended to pat historical reconO
 
struction or re-enactment activities at a loan priority.  That
 
is not because they dbmpps we of theme but b
ase our budget
 
is so very small --  t
'be smallest in the Rsdvrseat -- and they
 
feel that the support of traditional arts that are still in
 
active use in a
mities is a aorf caa
rcial Aatrd.  You might
 
wish. therefore, to renew your application to the Indiana
 
Committee for the 8  anities, siacs it includes the discipline
 
of history, on both a state and federal level
..
 
Frankly, as a purely personal remark, let me ask if you really
 
want to expand your festival costs by the sum of twenty-five
 
thousand dollars? Rven if we were able to fund you to that
 
extent, it would be for a maxjw
�= of two years. and you might
 
then find yourself in a difficult position to raise that kind
 
of money elsewhere.  You * of course , know your own situation
 
best, but it's be e
t my OVn experience that bigger is not
 
always better, and I have seen lots of lovely local events
 
deteriorate under the impact of too many people. especially
 
tourists.
 
G

Please read the material in the front of our guidelines
 
thoroughly; then, ®f course, if you think your activities
 
fit under that description, we'll certainly accept an appli-
cation.  And don't, by the way, get neurotic about the January
 
1 deadline.  We are well aware that the mails will be excessively
 
slog during the coming wooks.

Bow nice of you to respond s3 generously and so quickly.  There
 
is no protocol involved whatever ; I invite panelists ox they

call you and ask if you'd like to check a particular situa-
tion out for the ]
Program.  I do a lot of tha n nothing takes
 
the place of face-to-face meetings in folklore, as you well
 
know.
 
By all means, go  ahead and write me about Mr . May, if a use-
ful project occurs to yau.  or write ab:�►t anything else you
 
run across that see m to need doing . The s
indowm
osat likes to
 
have people on panels who are actively at work within their
 
various fields; therefore some degree of conflict of interest
 
is inevitable . We have various procedures that we adopt
 
when a s
ituation like that comes up, and they appear to work
 
pretty well.
 
The main thinil I needed to know was wheth er you were
 
interested, and if you were continuing to $o active field
 
work.  You are a gentle
en of such varied talents that it

Folk Arts recently received an application from the Puerto
 
Rican Arts and Cultural Center of Rochester, Now York.  In
 
subsequent negotiations , Dan Sheehy met with the director of
 
that organization, a priest, named Fr. William Loperena.  He
 
was impressed both with Fr. L
-opeareana and the program of the
 
center, and felt that in certain ways they were warking at
 
an even higher level of organisation than same Puerto Rican
 
groups in New York City.
 
Z took Fr. Loperena's vitf

Dear Mike;
 
1 an sorry y
o u're having such an irritating tisa of it, and
 
I
's sorry to have taken so long to write and tell you r
so.  I
 
:bane things have settled down a bit.
 
It sounds to to like a typical academic situatioa M at you're
 
dealing with, and I think you are c
over-reacting a bit.  Some-
thing happens to academies during their training that sub-
jects them to particalar kinds of nearness.  It see ms to me
 
this is due to the fact that tbay have gage through an
 
extremely long arduous, and authoritarian routine of train-
ing and then been turned out into a society that doesn't
 
particularly value their expertise. Professors simply don't
 
get the general respect afforded, for example, lawyers or
 
dactors or even minister*.
 
So, most professors I k w oaly get the respect that they
 
have earned, within the academic world itself.  This t
it to
 
turn them into classro o
m tyrants, protectors of the sacted
 
turf, institutional politicians of various types, ar lvmers.
 
But there they are, and t
hey know quits a lot, and mast of
 
them are quite smart.  They must be good for something, and
 
your and my job is to find out just w
het it is, sad steer
 
them into doing it . I face t
he sum problem an many levels
 
emery days what to do with an uneducated ez-a3ca Wlie who
 
kno w sad ador es every bl

 (
And
 
be fey well he right.)  that to do with an Indian txxbal
 
.

 .
.
 
representative who has so thoroughly learned bureaucratic
 
procedures that a simple cultural retention project turns out
 
to have a nine wage budget.  They all know things; they are
 
all theip; the problem is to help them fit their expertise
 
into the Seeds that are so apparent.
 
You and I
, too, carry our problems with us.  We're not so
 
pluperfect either: there are seventeen t
ime  every day when
 
I feel I flubbed something * and I expect you do too.  Don't
 
get too personally co
 t
 it
 iv
+e, Mike.  d
er we live
r in
 
a horrendously e
canpetitive society where all the forces
 
within it are pushing you into a s
ee-
-agaiast-them stance,
 
and don't feel that you always have to be the one that's
 
right.  Pick your shots carefully, and then stand firm.
 
on the other things, maybe somebody else is righter than
 
you are; at least I try to console myself by thinking that.
 
Anyway, be well and happy * and keep punching, and I apolo-
gize for laying all this long unsolicited series of opinions
 
on you,  Keep in toucht I value voax opinions too, you know # 
and always fin d mach to think about in your letters.  And I
 
love hearing about political fights in detail; they are the
 
most interesting things that happen.

,
Dear mx. Watson:
 
it was nice to talk with you yesterday.
 
I am enclosin3 the Folk hits brochure that explains our pro-
gram.  aowever, I a
re also enclosing guidelines for the Polk
 
Music Program,  (which I also administer) because an idea
 
occurred to me after we had hung up.
 
it so ws to we that you said you were a student of the
 
blue*# that is, that you yourself play and have taken lessons
 
from various blusmmen.  You will notice in the Folk Music
 
guidelines that we have an apprenticeship category through
 
which we can give small grants to do just that.  This part
 
of the program might be s
o mething you would want to con-
sider applying for before your tax exemption Paper* come
 
through.  The limit of funding in that category has been
 
revised upward, by the s
p
ray -
-- it's n
o w up to $2 ,500
-
Finally,  I don't want to be too discouraging, but 2 think you
 
should consider c W fully the whole filming question.  Our
 
advisory panel has gotten extremely conservative about
 
funding W i n, since they can, if not watched, eat up our
 
entire extremoVy small budget.  They insist on seeing a

Dear Mr. Collins:
 
Bess Hawes, Director of the Folk Art Program, referred
 
your letter concerning funding for the interior renovation
 
and furnishing of the .
19th-century log house to s
ae for
 
reply.
 
Unfortunately, capital expenses arennot allowable for
 
Endowment funding for projects of this type.  money for
 
t
eechfical assistance and capital funds should be avail-
able from the Department of the Interior/National Park
 
service:.  These funds,am dants,  loans and technical assistance
 
would be available to you pending :
a decision of eligibility
 
of the cabin for the "National Register for Historic Places."
 
To secure a nomination, if you have not done so already,
 
and to find out more about their programs, you should
 
contact your State Historic Preservation Officer, Dr.
 
Thomas H. Smith, Director, Ohio Historical Society, Interttate
 
71 at 17th Avenue, Columbus, Ohio 43211 (
61 4/4f
a5-1500,
 
extension 213).
 
How marvelous to have been able to save the cabin and what
 
an unexpected find!
 I have enclosed our guidelines to
 
show you the types of projects a
re do fund, for your informa-
tion.
 
Thank you for your interest in the
 owment*s programs.
 
Sincerely,

thank you for your invitation to he a member of the Advisory
 
noaard of the Wayne State university Folklore Archive publi-
cation series.
 Z am truly honored.
 
DQvever, I an
. a
:!raid I must decline
,.  My c
-urrent position
 
keeps we just too bysy to underta3ce such a responsibility.
 
I am certainly attempting to keep an active stand inq in
 
folklore while working in the public vector, but I must limit
 
my participation to less demanding projects for the ti "
.
 
being, I
'm afraid.
 
May I take this occasion to wish this extremely interesting
 
and much-needed project well?  I shall look forward to read-
inq the results of your
. labors.
 
Cordially,
 
Aess Loaa<x !

.  Folk Arts has always been and will continue to be
 
delighted to have Regional Representatives, singly or in
 
flocks, at our panel meetings.  A
. few points on logistics:
 
a
.  S
hould the Progra m take the initiative and in-
vite a different Representative to each meeting, perhaps?
 
I have bean heaitaftA to intrude c
an their busy schadule3,
 
and ha w just gaited until someone turned up: however,
 
in cases whe=r
e we have a la w* nu t
ter of applications
 
from a single region, maybe we should invite?
 
b.  In either case ,
 if A*W
 mal I epre
 tativ*0
 
planning to attend a Folk Arts M eting
  
let us know
 
that they are coming ahead of time. we could try to got
 
them panel book'
s for their consideration in advance of the
 
meeting.
 
C.  In view of the large number of panel meetings,
 
Radvwsent-wide, the idea of having two Regional Reps at
 
every panel meeting sMms extremely costly in travel funds
 
and perhaps owen tnwLee in terms of the
y a
mount of time
 
they Would be spending out of the field.  (At least that
 
is our c
apinion, for Nhat it's worth.)

Dear No. Davanport
 
Thank you for your letter and y
our interesting file outline.
 
I wish I could say, with Sandy Ives, come on and apply to
 
Folk Arts, but I really believe you would stand a better
 
cb
 m
a a, applying to tbm Media Arts Program at the W
it.
 
I Abell enclose application fo ra and guidelines for both
 
programs, ancd l
ent you decide for yourself.
 
The problem I see with your proposal
, as a Folk Arta project
 
is that we have in the past fund ed only filmic which document
 
or camoom traditional artistic activity or particular artists,
 
whetrat
iles your film is really concerned with a way of life or
 
an Industry . Media Arts, on the other hand, is amt up to
 
support files itself ax an art form: therefore thay don't
 
particularly care what a film is about, so long as it is an
 
artistically m
at piece of fil mmaking.
 
You don't mention what your tine acbedulie is.  Bath Media
 
Arts mad Folk Arts have as October 3 deadline cmdmg up.
 
if you act really quickly e you c
a
a
au W get is to either
 
prcegram for that deadline.  You mar wm* ft give yourself
 
more time to develop a well
 ore d awlication,  Zn
 
that case, the am* Folk Arts deadline is Januarys the
 
Media Arta deadli- s are listed in the anclosed.book.
 
An app
rtieation fors, properly filled out, should precede a
 
of your film work. Got in touch either with Sally
 
Ye
tr
r3wrich in Folk Arts at 242-
+634-4282 or Julie M ace in
 
Media Arts at 202-63"
300 for instructions c
an A
m and
 
theses to send a sa
ws.  The rule is to call us

Ms. Glorianna Davenport

 October 3, 1978
 
Finally, assuminq that your film sample is of h14^ quality.
 
I am sure that the Polk Arta Program will be interested in
 
the project and will support your application even if you
 
take my  r
c-a —rarristion to go to Media Arta.  The two programs
 
often c
ute on projects of sutual interest.
 
I hope the above information is useful and not too ov wv *Ub-
inq.  Don't hesitate to call if you nerd further assis

Dear Wig,
 
I have a sad duty to perform today that I
've be
e n putting off inexcusably
 
because I guess I just don't want to do it,  However, the fact is that
 
I do not have the physical tuna or e
f
f
igy to be a board s aber of Foxf
 ire.
 
Alan Jabbour was vi
.ser than I
.
 
I really had no idea when I took this job at the Endowment how totally
 
consuming it would be.  I am not complaining, you understand; I like
 
to work this way, but I do find that it has left me absolutely no s
ezm-
tal energy for anything else.  I
've spent this past spring gradually
 
divesting myself of my other respow1bilities, putting Foxfire off
 
till the last.  But I realize naw that I cannot co
mae to the next meeting
 
and I am sure that by the time the mmt meeting rolls round, I will be
 
equally consumed.
 
I really apologize for having accepted in the first place, but do you
 
suppose a reappointment could be considered, perhaps, when I leave
 
here?
 
Affectionately,
