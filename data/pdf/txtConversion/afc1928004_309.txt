When you know your duty, comrades,

Hold the fort with firm endeavor, 
When you're in the right!

On the road of life!

Courage in the strife !

W E 
march'd bfihincl the Branigan's Band on the great St. Pat-
rick's Day, 
With fifes and drums a- playing martial airs, 
From Ulster, Munster, Connamara, you see we are on hand, 
To march with the music to the tune of the Branigan's Band; 
Oh 
we march so gayly down the street, 
And ev'ry one we meet says, don't they step it neat! 
We smile on all the girls we meet, 
While marching down behind the famous Branigan's Band, 
CHORUS. 
Mark time, keep step, forward, march away! 
With eyes out, toes in, march in grand array! 
Shoulder arms, with head erect, together hand in hand, 
Like heroes bold the young and old will march with the Brani-
gan's Band. 
The chambermaids in the big hotels, they raise the windeys 
high, 
For handkerchiefs they're waving towels to catch our soldiers' 
eyes; 
They've left their hash to come out and mash when the mar-
shal gives command; 
Then we all raise our hats to the tune of the Branigan's Band; 
Oh! don't their hearts go pit- a-pat, 
As each one lifts his hat, the lean as well as fat, 
Says, there's my Dan, there goes my Pat, • 
He's the Daisy swell that's with the famous Branigan's Band. 
Mark time, etc. 
011 we had a 
ball in Emerald Hall, and an illegant supper, too; 
There was beans and peas and frigazees, and oysters fat for you, 
With pickled stews, and hullaboloos, and Irish quail so grand; 
Beets, and cheese, and some potheen for the boys of the Brani-
gan's Band. 
Oh! it's then we sung, and danc'd a 
reel, 
And oh! how good we feel, we make the ladies squeal, 
So when morning comes it's home we steal, 
With the boys all drunk as lords, with the Branigan's Band. 
Mark time, etc.

LET the past be all forgotten— 
Why that look of weary pain ? 
Tell me that you love me fondly,— 
Take me to your heart again. 
Bid my days flow on so gently, 
Calmly as the Summer sea; 
Whisper truly, dearest, sweetest, 
Have I 
not been kind to thee I 
CHORUS. 
Stay the teal•drop falling fast, 
Darksome days will never last; 
Darling, whisper sweet to me, 
Have I 
not been kind to thee ? 
Lovely roses soon NS ill blossom, 
Tho' the leaves are falling round; 
What if days of sorrow greet us, 
Sunny hours will soon be found. 
Can we e'er forget the gladness 
That has bloom'd for you and me? 
Chide me not, hut whisper .sweetly,— 
Have I 
not been kind to thee ? 
Stay the teardrop, etc. 
Drive away that look of sorrow, 
Eviry fault of mine forgive 4 
Let our past be all forgotten, 
Only for your sake I 
live I 
Smile your olden smile then, dearest, 
In those eyes my heav'n I 
see; 
Doubt no more my heart's affection, 
Have I 
not been kind to thee ? 
Stay the teardrop, etc.

Music by DAVE BRAliA.M.

I'm located at headquarters, 
A " special officer !" 
Cornelius ' Iliarity, 
Here, at your serviCe, sir ! 
I 
know the thieves and blackguards too, 
Wherever they may be, 
And if you want a " fly copper," 
Call Moriarity 
CHORUS. 
I'm a 
dandy copper in the Broadway Squad, 
A " Metropolitan M. P.," 
And the young girls cry when I'm passing by, 
" 
Are you there, Moriarity 
The shop- girls going to labor 
In the morn, at eight o'clock, 
They wink and blink their loving eyes 
At me on ev'ry side! 
They say I 
am their darling, 
With me they'd tra, la, la, le ! 
In a 
smiling way you'd hear them say, 
SPOREN.—" You duckey 1" 
" 
Sweet Moriarity !" 
I'm a 
dandy copper, etc. 
My uniform is Navy blue, 
And it fits me like a 
duck ; 
I 
escort the ladies in the street 
All thro' the mad and muck ! 
For coach and horse stop when I 
cross, 
I'm the ladies' own baby ! 
As on they go, they whisper low, 
" 
Are you there, Moriarity r 
I'm a 
dandy copper, etc, 
THE OCEAN BURIAL. 
Oh I 
bury me not in the deep deep seal 
The words came low and mournfully 
From the pallid lips of a 
youth who lay 
On his cabin couch, at the close of the day; 
He had wasted and pined, till o'er his brow 
Death's shade had slowly passed, and now 
-Where the land and his fond loved home were nigh, 
They had gathered around him to see him die. 
Oh ! bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
Where the billowing shroud will swell o'er me, 
Where no light will break through the dark cold wave, 
And no sunbeam rest upon my grave 
It matters not, I 
have often been told, 
Where the body shall lie, when the heart is cold, 
Yet grant, oh i 
grant this boon to me: 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, deep sea I 
For, in fancy I've listened to the well known words, 
The free wild winds, and the songs of the birds, 
I 
have thought of home, of cot, and of bower, 
And of scenes that I 
loved in childhood's hour: 
I 
had even hoped to be laid, when I 
died, 
In the churchyard there, on the green hill side: 
• 
By the homes of my father my grave should be; 
Oh I 
bury me not in the deep, deep Sea l 
Let my death slumbers be where a 
mother's prayer, 
And a 
sister's tear shall be mingled there; 
It will be sweet, ere the gentle heart's throb is o'er, 
To know, when its fountain shall gush no more , 
That those it so fondly hath yearned for, will come 
To plant the wild flower of Spring on my tomb; 
Let me lie where those loved ones will weep over me; 
Oh bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
And there is another whose tears would 'be shed 
For him who lay far in an ocean bed; 
in hours that it pains me to think of now. 
She bath twined those locks and bath kissed this brow. 
In the hair she bath wreathed shall the sea-serpent hiss? 
And the brow she bath pressed, shall the cold wave kiss? 
For the sake of that bright one that waiteth for me, 
Oh! bury me not in the deep, deep sea! 
She hath been in my dreams—His voice failed there; 
They gave no heed to his dying prayer, 
They have lowered him low o'er the vessel, side; 
Above him has closed the dark cold tide. 
Where to dip the light wings the sea bird rests, 
And the blue waves dance o'er the ocean crest, 
Where the billows bound and the winds sport free; 
They have buried him there, in the deep, deep sea I

THE VACANT CHAIR. 
We shall meet, but we shall miss him; 
There will be one vacant chair; 
We shall linger to caress him, 
While we breathe our evening prayer. 
When, a 
year ago, we gathered, 
Joy was in his mild blue eye; 
But a 
golden cord is severed, 
And our hopes in ruins lie. 
CHORUS. 
We shall meet, but we shall miss him; 
There will be one vacant chair; 
We shall linger to caress him, 
When we breathe our evening prayer. 
At our fireside, sad and lonely, 
Often will the bosom swell 
At remembrance of the story 
How our noble Willie fell; 
How he strove to bear our banner 
Through the thickest of the fight, 
And upheld our country's honor, 
In the streLgth of manhood's might. 
We shall meet, ,ke. 
True, they tell us wreaths of glory 
Ever more will deck his brow; 
But this soothes the anguish only, 
Sweeping o'er our heart- strings now. 
Sleep to-day, 0 
early fallen! 
In thy green and narrow bed; 
Dirges from the pine and cypress 
Mingle with the tears we shed. 
We shall meet, cbek

THE HAPPY FATHER OF THREE. 
A PATHETIC EPISODE . 
W ords by F. 
LANGBIUDGE. 
Composed and sung by G. H . 
M ACDERMOTT. 
COME, hush- a-by, dearest of dears ! 
Ah! what's to become of poor me ? 
I've only been married two years, 
And this little chap's number three. 
If at such an astonishing rate 
Our family's always increased, 
It's clearly our terrible fate 
To have twenty-seven at least. 
CHORUS. 
Come, old fellow, mayhaps, if you'll swallow your pap, 
Your mind less excited may be; 
And, my dear little chap, if you won't take a 
nap, 
Whatever's to happen to me 7 
He's a 
fine little fellow, of course— 
Now, don't begin kicking, I 
beg--
Such lungs, and as strong as a 
horse— 
There, that's pretty well for a 
leg. 
Beef, bread and potatoes are dear, 
But babies uncommonly cheap; 
The worst of this little one here 
Is somehow, he won't go to sleep. 
Come, old fellow, ete. 
Jane's snoring—just listen to that— 
While I 
shiver out in the cold; 
I'll wake her, and give her the brat--
But no! she might happen to scold. 
(1) 
THE EIAPPY FATHER OF THREE.—Concluded. 
Come, hush- a-by, baby, kiss, kiss 
He only gets wider awake; 
I 
think after going through this, 
That marriage is quite a 
mistake. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Come, hush- a-by, there's a 
good child, 
The clock's striking three, what a 
fix ! 
I'm getting uncommonly wild— 
They're going to call me at six! 
Of getting the ghost of a 
nap 
My chances appear rather blue; 
Mild measures have failed, so, old chap, 
I'll try what a 
slapping will do. 
Come, old fellow, etc. 
Stop howling—be quiet, you wretch l 
The neighbors are sure to complain; 
Shut up, or a 
bobby I'll fetch— 
Thieves—murder—fire—pick-pockets—Jane ! 
I 
tell you l'm losing my head; 
I'm chilled to the marrow right through, 
And now, ma'am, I'm going to bed— 
Here take him, and sit on him, do! 
CHORUS. 
Oh! he won't drink his pap, and he won't take a 
nap, 
And the clock's struck a 
quarter-past-three, 
And I 
don't care a 
rap if you throttle the chap, 
So long as you take him from me. 
(Throws baby of, and exit frantically.)

SHAUGHRAITIg. 
Words by GEO. COOPER, 
Am.—" Pat Molloy." 
THERE was a 
brave young Irish lad, the pride of all the land, 
For dancing and for rattling sport the chief of all the band; 
The girls they smiled upon him, too, and sighed when he pass-
ed by, 
And shyly glanced upon him from the corner of their eye! 
Unto his master, leal, and true he never swerved an inch, 
A noble friend he proved to be at each unlucky pinch, 
He followed him beyond the sea when tyrarny was rife, 
This darling boy would save him, and would shield him with 
his life! 
CHORUS. 
Am.—Chorus of " Regular Army, 0." 
Then it's hip hurrah for Irish lads and dear old Ireland, too; 
Their hearts are kind— you'll always find them generous and 
true! 
For their native land they'll bravely fight, and everywhere they 
go 
They charm the girls, and boldly deal destruction to the foe. 
Am.—" Cruiskin Lawn." 
When the Shaughraun's master came 
To green Erin's land of fame, 
From the perils of prison so drear, 
The priest so good and kind 
Sheltered him where none could find, 
And this noble Irish lad was ever near. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
But when prison walls so cold 
Did his master's form enfold, 
To the rescue so nobly he sped; 
No bolts and bars can bind 
Those who fight for home, you'll find, 
And the hirelings found an empty cage instead. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
Ara.—" Killarney." 
Love had won the Shaughraun's heart, 
Pierced it with a 
fatal dart! 
From his girl he ne'er could part 
Till the life within had flown; 
Her's the smile that shone afar 
Like the lovely morning star, 
(1) 
19 
THE SHAUGHGRAITN.—Continued. 
Never grief her beauty mar 
Till he claims her for his own ! 
Angels were not half so bright; 
Oh, his dreams were sweet delight I 
She his vision day and night, 
Pride of dear Killarney. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
.
A.TR.—" Tim Finnegan's Wake." 
ut when they all thought the Shaughraun dead, 
A handsome " waking" they gave to him, 
And they laid him upon a 
feather bed; 
There was Mickey and Pat and Ted and Tim! 
And. the whiskey it flowed in the sweetest way, 
And the ructions and dancing at once began, 
And there wasn't one that knew that day 
That ;-f-anu was a 
real " live " Irishman. 
Then it's hip hurrah, etc. 
BIG RUBBER BUSTLE. 
Banjo Solo by ED. H ARRIGAN. 
I'LL ling of my girl, my lovely girl, 
She could play seven up and rounce, 
One fault she had, she had eyes like a 
shad, \ 
She couldn't set still but she'd bounce. 
I 
shall never forget the first time we met, 
With a 
wash-tub she was having a 
tussle, 
She fell on the ground and bounded out of town;\ 
The gal with the big rubber bustle. 
I 
searched far and near till I 
found out my dear, 
She was stuck on the end of a 
steeple, 
High in the air she was hung by the hair, 
Making snouts down at the people. 
A rope I 
soon found, fetched her to the ground, 
It used up a 
great deal of muscle ; 
To the preacher we sped, I 
was bound to wed, 
The gal wid the injun rubber bustle. 
When we got to the place she was red in the face, 
The preacher ses now den I'll tie her; 
On her bustle she dropped, frough de skylight she 
Like a 
base ball de boys call a 
flyer. 
She lit on a 
cloud and went out of sight, 
To get into heaven she'll tussle, 
She made a 
mile at a 
jump, at every thump 
She got on dat big rubber bustle.

BILL COOPER THE " SOOPER." 
Words by H. 
S. 
LEIGH. 
Sung by G. H. M A.CDERMOTT. 
Copyright, 1875, by G. H. MACIDEHNOTT. 
[I hereby warn publishers against publishing this sang, and shall prosectet 
any infringement on this copyright.] 
Tins world's ever turning, and life is a 
swing, 
Where we all get our ups and our downs, 
We could laugh and be jolly, if Fortune would bring 
Many more of her smiles than her frowns. 
Yet I 
think, as all beings must live out their life, 
That the best style of living is mine ; 
can take my own share both of quiet and strife, 
And the kicks and the ha' pence combine. 
CHORUS. 
In private I'm only Bill Cooper, 
And fond of my billiards and beer; 
But at night on the stage I'm a" sooper," 
And call myself Percy de Vere. 
I 
seem but a 
seedy old codger, no doubt, 
As from tavern to tavern I 
roam; 
But when Shakespeare may call on B. C. to come out, 
William Cooper is always at home. 
Though my hat may be shabby, my boots down at heel, 
And my garments suggestive of age, 
I 
am told my appearance is highly genteel, 
When I've put on my dress for the stage. 
In private, etc. 
In deep melo-dramas I'm frequently seen, 
Though I 
own that I 
never get heard; 
Or with virtuous peasants I 
dance on the green, 
But I'm never permitted one word. 
In the pantomime opening I 
put on a 
mask, 
And I 
am always the first they knock down; 
When the opening is ended I 
finish my task, 
And go on to be kicked by the clown. 
In private, etc. 
Yet soopers have cares like the rest of mankind, 
And our life has its tragical side; 
When the curtain comes down and we're hidden behind, 
There's an end of our spangles and pride. 
We .aave wives to be fed, we have rents to be paid, 
And the little ones ding to their dad; 
It is hard on myself and my likes, I'm afraid, 
In the winter when business is bad. 
In private, etc.. 
(1) 
23 
BILL COOPER THE " SOOPER."—Concluded. 
I'll keep up my spirits, whate'er may betide, 
And cry long live our national stage; 
And I'll say to myself with an accent of pride, 
I 
am one of the lights of the age. 
Folks may croak as they please, till they're black in the face, 
About art and the drama's decline; 
But the stage cannot possibly come to disgrace 
While it boasts as much talent as mine. 
In private, etc. 
BOB HOPPER TNT: COPPER. 
Sung by G. H. 1SIAcDEnmorr. 
I'm a 
Bobby, I 
am, and I 
know my work, 
My duty I 
never, I 
never will shirk; 
I'm a 
good ' un to run in, a 
good ' un to swear, 
At that game a 
Bobby's eternally there, 
And if you get copped by day or by night, 
This copper's the cove who can hold you tight. 
CHORUS. 
We do it up proper, 
We do it up proper, 
We do it up proper, we're always right; 
Bob Hopper the copper, 
Bob Hopper the copper, 
Bob Hopper the copper can hold you tight. 
A 
policeman's life is the life for me, 
True blue is 'the color we wear you see, 
And the reason we wear it, ' twixt me and you, 
Is because we can swear till all is blue; 
The small, small boys we put in a 
fright, 
We give ' ern the blues when we hold ' em tight. 
We do it up proper, etc. 
A 
policeman's staff is the tool for me, 
We lay it about with such fiendish glee, 
For we Bobbies can always go on the strike, 
And hit where we please whenever we like, 
And whoever declares we are not in the right, 
We cop 'ern at once and we hold ' em tight. 
We do it up proper, etc. 
A 
policeman's grub is the food for me, 
And the price of a 
policeman's booze is free, 
And a 
peeler's love is a 
marvellous she 
As belongs to the area-stoker-a-cee, 
And when into supper we drop of a 
night, 
Whate'er we lay hands on we hold it tight. 
We do it up proper, *

[Scene, a 
street in 1st E. A 
iwise of altercation outside. 
JERRY 
Bzossom, dresscd in ragged clothes, with a 
very red face and a 
much 
redder nose, is v:olently pushed on the stage from the Prompt side.] 
JERRY. — Now don't you go and do that again. 
If ye does— 
I'll make yer know it. 
(Rubbing himself.) 
You see if I 
don't. 
You don't know what it is to kick a 
gen l'inan. 
An' a 
Colleg-
iate at that! (Looks at audience.) 
Yes! you way laugh! 
But 
it's so all the same. 
I 
is a 
Collegiate! 
Was-nt I 
found in a 
basket under the College pump ? When I 
was a 
orphling? A 
little and orphling ? as they says in the drug stores when they 
askseses to go into the back shop to get some whiskey for the 
stomach complaint. 
They gets it little as the druggist meas-
ures it out; but they takes it orphling—or orphan—I 
forget 
the right prouuncification. 
When I 
used to stand in front of 
the St. Nicholas, years ago, with ray white kids on and me 
high glass in me heye, a 
insulting of the gals as they used to 
pass by, and feathering the green swells into father's shop to 
get fleeced, they wouldn't a 
dared to kick me out of a 
bar room. 
No! They know d 
a 
thing or two in them days. But now I'm 
old and seedy, I 
suppose I'll have to put up with if-. Who'd 
ever think, looking at me as I 
am, (turns out his pant's pockets,) 
that I 
was once the son of a 
gay gambolier. 
(To the audience.) 
You may laugh! Yes—keep on—I 
knows what your a 
think-
ing on !—( Pause.) I 
said I 
was a 
orphling. (Pause.) 
And so 
I 
was—till father came--and took me in and did for me.

I

I

I 
happened to have no money, 
Of my honesty- he'd a 
doubt, 
So he caught my collar and slack of my pants, 
And then he bounced me out. 
[Spoken.] Yes! indeed he did. You wouldn't think so. But 
I've got the marks on my body to this day- that is (sera/chins

didn't get them somewhere else since then. 
CHORUS. - Come, listen to, 
If I 
had a 
barrel of whiskey, 
And sugar, three hundred pounds! 
The City Hall bell to put it in-
The clapper to stir it round! 
I'd drink to the health of all New York, 
And tell it far and near; 
I'm a

THE MONEYLESS MAN. 
Ry HENRY STANTON. 
Is there no place on the face of the earth 
Where charity dwelleth, where virtue has birth! 
Where bosoms in kindness and mercy will heave, 
And the poor and the wretched shall ask and receive'? \ 
Is there no place on earth where a 
knock from the poor 
Will bring a 
kind angel to open the door ? 
Ah! search the wide world wherever you can, 
There is no open door for the moneyless man. 
Go look in the hall where the chandelier light 
Drives off with its splendor the darkness of night; 
Where the rich hanging velvet, in shadowy fold, 
Sweeps gracefully down with its trimmings of gold, 
And mirrors of silver take up and renew 
In long lighted vistas the ' wildering view; 
Go there in your patehes,and find if you can 
A welcoming smile for the moneyless man. 
Go look in your church of the cloud-reaching spire, 
Which gives back to the sun his same look of fire, 
Where the arches and columns are gorgeous within, 
And the walls seem as pure as a 
soul without sin; 
Go down the long aisle—see the rich and the great, 
In the pomp and the pride of their worldly estate; 
Walk down in your patches, and find if you can, 
Who opens a 
pew for a 
moneyless man. 
Go to your judges, in dark flowing gown, 
With the scales wherein law layeth quietly down 
Where he frowns on the weak and smiles on the strong, 
And punishes right while he justifies wrong; 
Where jurors their lips on the Bible have laid, 
To render a 
verdict they've already made; 
Go there in the court-room, and find if you can, 
Any law for the case of a 
moneyless man. 
Go look in the banks, where Mammon has told 
His hundreds and thousands of silver and gold; 
Where, safe from the hands of the starving and poor, 
Lie piles upon piles of the.glittering ore; 
Walk up to the counter—and there you may stay, 
Till your limbs have grow old and your hair turns gray, 
And you'll find at the bank not one of the clan 
With money to lend to a 
moneyless man.

THE MONEYLESS MAN.—Concluded. 
Then go to your hovel !—no raven has fed 
The wife who has suffered so long for her bread; 
Kneel down by her pallet and kiss the death frost 
From the lips of the angel your poverty lost— 
Then turn in your agony upward to God, 
And bless while it smites you, the chastening rod; 
And you'll find at the end of your life's little span, 
There's a 
welcome above for the moneyless man. 
JANE AND JEREMIAH. 
I'VE come this evening to complain 
Of the treatment of a 
girl call'd Jane, 
With eyes and hair as brown as a 
nut, 
Whose business place it was in the Cut; 
Penny ices there she sold, 
But like her trade her heart it was cold, 
Her each night I 
hear in a 
dream 
Cry," Lemon ice, raspberry or cream!" 
CH0111JS. 
I 
never shall forget that girl 
Whom all the chaps admire, 
Nor yet the names and little games 
Of Jane and Jeremiah I 
She used to drive a 
roaring trade, 
And in the ice line money made, 
She turned them out so very nice, 
I 
lived on nothing else but ice; 
But on this fare I 
grew so thin, 
That I 
was merely bone and. skin, 
And after all she told me flat, 
She liked a 
fellow short and fat. 
I 
never shall, etc, 
She said that in the summer days, 
The ice line is a 
trade that pays, 
But in the winter, when it's cold, 
There's very little to be sold. 
She met a 
man called Jeremiah, 
Who kept a 
brazier full of fire, 
And who dealt, in the winter time, 
In baked chestnuts and elder wine. 
I 
never shall, eta.

THE OLD FOLKS ARE GONE, 
Far, far in many lands I've wander'd. 
Sadly and lone, 
My heart IN as ever turning southward, 
To all the dear ones at home; 
Here, after all my weary roaming, 
At early dawn, 
I've come, and find the cot still standing, i 
But oh! the Old Folks are gone. 
Cuon.us. 
Here I 
wandersad and lonely, 
In the dear old home, 
Those that I 
love so well and fondly—. 
All, all the old folks are gone. 
Here's where I 
frolick'd with my brother, 
Under the tree; 
Here's where I 
knelt beside my mother, 
From care and sorrow free; 
Still sing the little birds as sweetly, 
At night and morn,. 
Still runs the little brook as fleetly 
But oh I 
the Old Folks are gone. 
Here I 
wander sad and lonely, arc. 
Down where the old banana's waving, 
They're laid to rest, 
Where Swanee's peaceful water's laving 
The green turf o'er their breast; 
But there's a 
home I 
know, where parting 
Never can come; 
Oh! for that home I 
must be starting, 
That's where the Old Folks are gone. 
Here I 
wander sad and lonely, dm.

WE HAVE LIVED AND LOVED TOGETHER. 
We have lived and loved together, 
Through many changing years; 
We have shared each other's gladness, 
And wept each other's tears. 
I 
have never known a 
sorrow 
That was long unsoothed by thee, 
That was long unsoothed by thee 
For thy smile can make a 
summer, 
Where darkness else would be. 
Like the leaves that fall around us, 
In Autumn's fading hairs, 
Are the traitor smiles that darken, 
'When the cloud of sorrow lowers; 
And though many such we've known, lovo, 
Too prone, alas! to range, 
Too prone, alas! to range. 
We both can speak of one, love, 
'Whom time could never change. 
} 
Repeat. 
GOOD-BYE, SWEETHEART, GOOD-BYE. 
The bright stars fade, the morn is breaking, 
The dew-drops pearl each bud and leaf, 
And I 
from thee my leave am taking 
With bliss too brief, 
With bliss, with bliss too brief. 
How sinks my heart with fond alarms, 
The tear is biding in mine eye : 
For, time cloth thrust me from thine arms: 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye! 
Good-bye, sweet-heart, good-bye! 
For, time doth thrust me from thine arms, 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye! 
The sun is up, the lark is soaring, 
Loud swells the song of chanticleer: 
The lev'ret bounds o'er earth's soft flooring, 
Yet I 
am here, 
Yet I 
am here, yet I 
am here. 
For, since night's gems from heaven did fade 
And morn to floral lips doth hie, 
I 
could not leave thee, though I 
said: 
" 
Good-bye. sweetheart, good-bye, 
good-bye, sweetheart, goodbye." 
3. could not leave thee, though I 
said: 
" 
Good-bye, sweetheart, good-bye."

2 
I 
went to the village school, 
And I 
proved so uncommon quick. 
That I 
galloped all through my geography, 
And I 
skipped my arithmetic. 
And ray writing was " up and down," 
In a 
new and original style, 
And I 
jumped clean over the globes, I 
did, 
I 
was so volatile, 
I 
was so volatile, I 
was so volatile, 
E'en the Rule of Three was naught to me, 
I 
was so volatile. 
( 
1 ) 
I 
-AM SO VOLATILE. Concluded. 
3 
Then didn't I 
love the girls, 
And didn't the girls love me: 
But I 
never could keep to one you know, 
Through this infirmity, 
For as soon as Mary Ann 
Had inveigled me with her smile, 
I 
was " off" again to Betsy Jane, 
I 
was so volatile. 
I 
was so volatile, I 
was so volatile, 
I 
never could atop the question to pop, 
I 
was so volatile. 
4 
Then I 
joined the Volunteers, 
And I 
raced the corps for a 
wager; 
But I 
couldn't keep still at the weekly drill, 
In spite of the Sergeant Major. 
And if ever I'm called to face 
The foe in rank and file, 
I 
very much tear I 
shan't be " near," 
I 
am so volatile, 
I 
am so volatile, I 
am so volatile, 
I 
fear I 
might be " out of sight," 
I 
am so volatile. 
5 I 
got more active still 
In the course of my career, 
For my Uncle Bill left me in his will 
Ten thousand pounds a 
year. 
That my poor relations grieve 
And despair, there's no denial, 
For I 
hear them cry, He' never will die, 
He is so volatile. 
Yes, I 
am so volatile, oh, I 
am so volatile, 
They fume and fret, but nothing they'll get 
While I'm so volatile. 
(in an old man's voice.) 
6 
But now I'm getting old, 
My hair is thin and grey; 
And my voice is so weak, I 
can hardly speak, 
And I've rheumatiz they say. 
But as for my blessed limbs 
They're just as juvenile. 
For they riggle and riot, and won't keep quiet, 
They are so volatile. 
I 
am so volatile, I 
am so volatile, 
Tho' I'm getting old, yet still I'm told, 
I'm just as volatile.

BELLE BRANDON. 
'Neath a 
tree by the margin of the woodland, 
Whose spreading leafy boughs swept c'er the ground, 
With a 
path leading thither o 
er the prairie, 
When silence hung her night garb around; 
There oft I 
have wandered in the evening, 
When the summer winds are fragrant on the lea: 
There I 
saw the little beauty, Belle Brandon, 
And we met ' neath the old arbor tree. 
There I 
saw4the little beauty, Belle Brandon, 
And we met 'neath the old arbor tree. 
Belle Brandon was a 
birdling of the mountain, 
In her freedom she sported on her wings. 
And they said the life-current of the red man, 
Tinged her veins, from a 
far distant spring, 
And she loved her humble dwelling on the prairie, 
And her guileless happy heart clung to me, 
And I 
loved the little beauty, Belle Brandon, 
And we both loved the old arbor tree. 
And I 
loved the little beauty, tto 
On the trunk of the aged tree I 
carved them, 
Our names on the sturdy oak remain; 
But now I 
repair in sorrow to its shelter, 
And murmur to the wild-wind my pain; 
Oft I 
see there in solitude repining, 
For the beauty-dream that night brought to me, 
Peath has wed the little beauty, Belle Brandon, 
And she sleeps 'neath the old arbor tree. 
Death has wedlthe little beaesty, cte

HEa face is as fair as the daisies of spring, 
Her smile is a 
sunbeam of joy to my heart; 
Her sweet words of welcome, what gladness they bring! 
They linger to bless me when sunbeams depart. 
Her fair golden tresses, bewitching and bright, 
To dazzle the eyes of the lads never fail! 
But true to her promise, as stars to the night, 
Is Bessie, sweet, Bessie, the star of the vale! 
The star of the vale, the star of the vale, 
Is Bessie, sweet Bessie, the star of the vale! 
Her love is a 
treasure of worth all untold, 
And life would be sad if she were not my own; 
What joy, when we meet, her dear hands to enfold, 
And know that she loves me and loves me alone. 
We meet in the valley, when daylight is o'er, 
And stars of the twilight are twinkling so pale ; 
The bright days may go, but I'll love more and more, 
My Bessie, sweet Bessie, the star of the vale! 
The star of the vale, the star of the vale! 
My Bessie. sweet Bessie, the star of the vale !

Peal out, ye bells, peal joyfully, 
And cheer us on our way, 
One hundred years of Freedom shines 
Upon our heads to-day. 
Our banners bright float gallantly 
Upon the land and sea, 
Our matron, Freedom, wears with grace 
The cap of Liberty; 
The Eagle, king of all the birds, 
Is soaring in the air, 
And none dare pull our colors down 
While he is watching there. 
Peal out, ye bells, etc. 
Hurrah for sweet America, 
The home of Truth and Right; 
Hurrah, for Independence too, 
The fruit of Freedom's fight ; 
And while our Father, Washington, 
Lies quiet in his grave, 
We'll honor all his noble deeds, 
The land he fought to save. 
Peal out, ye bells, etc.

One hundred years have fled 
Since Independence was declared 
With blood our fathers shed; 
Our noble banner proudly floats 
On land and water, too, 
And ev'ry one respects with pride 
The red, the white and blue. 
CHORUS. 
We're something of a 
nation now; 
One hundred years have fled 
Since Independence was declared 
With blood our fathers shed. 
The brave and honest Washington, 
Who never told a 
lie, 
Lives in the heart of ev'ry one, 
His fame will never die ; 
He labored for his country's good, 
And now we firmly stand, 
A 
nation whose proud banner waves 
O'er ev'ry sea and land. 
We're something, etc. 
Now that a 
century has pass'd, 
We hail the great event, 
And with " hurrah's" and cannon's roar 
The air is freely rent; 
The eagle, freedom's noble bird, 
Will soar the azure sky, 
And ev'ry lorer of our flag 
Will hoist the banner high. 
We're something, etc.

Oust feet may wander far, far away, 
Mid scenes of beauty from place to place, 
But time can never for one short day 
The recollection of home efface; 
The heart may wander and for awhile 
Forget its pleasure as on we rove; 
But o'er the features then comes no smile 
When we remember the friends we love. 
CHORUS. 
The friends we love, the friends we love, 
When we remember the friends we love; 
But o'er the features there comes no smile 
When we remember the friends we love. 
The cheerful swallow returns in spring 
When sunny meadows no more are cold, 
And on a 
happy and graceful wing 
Revisits newly her nest of old, 
And thus forever the heart will seek 
With sad emotion its home afar; 
There is a 
story we long to speak— 
It matters little where'er we are. 
The friends we love, etc.

Kitchen in 3d grooves. 
Table and chairs, c. 
BERMUDAS (discovered). I 
met a 
friend of mine down the 
street this morning by the name of Alonzo Brady, and he pro-
mised to call and see me. 
It's a 
wonder he ain't here at this 
time. (knock.) 
Enter ALONZO. 
Ammo. Good morning, Bermudas. 
BERMUDAS. Good afternoon. 
What kept you so quick'? 
ALONZO. I 
could get here no later. 
BER. What's the trouble—any ' one sick in the family'? 
ALONZO. My boy got the diphtheria dipping around in mud 
gutters. 
BER I 
took notice the last time I 
saw him he was stooped 
over; how do you account for that ? 
ALONZO. He got that way looking for stumps. 
BER. What regiment are you walking out with now. 
ALONZO. I'm with the German Fifth. 
What company do 
you belong to'? 
BEE. I 
belong to the French Frog Eaters. 
ALONZO. What do you say if we start a 
small regiment of 
our own. 
BER. All right—I'm satisfied. 
What will we call it 7 
ALono. The Murphy Musketeers. 
SONG. 
You've heard of the Mulligan Guards, 
At Captain Jinks so gay, 
But we're the Murphy Musketeers, 
We're very proud to say; 
We charge each man five dollars a 
head— 
How do you like our style 7 
Our company is rather small, 
We fall in single file.

MURPHY MUSKETEERS.—Concluded. 
CHORUS. 
51. 
We've been turning out for years, 
Give us three hearty welcome cheers, 
Stop that car ! shout hurrah ! 
For the Murphy Musketeers. 
BER. Was you ever well up in conundrums '? 
ALoszo. No, but I 
was well up on the Island. 
BER. How far up was you"? 
ALONZO. I 
was so far up that it took me six months to get 
down. 
BER. I 
say, Alonzo, I 
have a 
Pompey Squash story to tell 
you. 
ALONZO. All right I 
tar on the wheel ! let it rip. 
BER. If you was to swallow a 
man what kind of a 
man would 
you like to swallow I 
ALONZO. A candy man. 
BER. No, I 
would rather swallow a 
little Dublin Porter. 
ALoszo. You are so smart, why is your nose like the Tri-
bune Building'? 
BER. Give it up. 
ALONZO. Because it's got a 
drinking saloon underneath. 
BEE. What's the difference between you and the moon 
ALONZO. Give it up. 
Bun. The moon is full twice a 
month, and you're full every 
day. 
ALONZO. What is a 
young fellow doing when he is talking 
sweet to his girl 
BER. Why, he is giving her taffy. 
ALONZO. How long does it take to hang a 
man before he dies'? 
BER. Ten minutes according to law. 
ALoszo. I 
saw you hanging around a 
distillery for two hours 
yesterday, and you ain't dead yet. 
SONG.—Last verse. 
We had the curbstone band, 
They played march upon the Rhine, 
And the dead heads on the sidewalk 
Did polka to the time ; 
Up Broadway to Thirty-third. 
Though every hole and alley, 
And then we stopped in Cherry street 
To get a 
wreath of Mrs. Tally. 
We've been turning, etc.

York.

H ARDING. 
THERE is not a 
man in the whole minstrel band, 
Who would ever go back on his friend ; 
Tito' dark be his face, yet the black can't efface 
The kind deeds which thro' life him attend; 
I 
hear the echo sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land; 
I 
list to its voice, and it bids me rejoice, 
Then hurrah for the minstrel band ! 
Then hurrah, then hurrah, 
Then hurrah for the minstrel band. 
I 
will speak first of one whom we lov'd in the past, 
He'd a 
heart that was noble and brave; 
Nelse Seymour, who never refus'd his last dime, 
If he thought you from hunger ' twould save; 
I 
hear his praises sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
The tall son of York, he has died at his work, 
And the pride of the minstrel band ! 
He was the pride, the pride, 
Was the pride of the Minstrel Band. 
Brave Unsworth, he stood like a 
Minstrel so true, 
'Till defeated at last by grim death, 
And Budworth, alas, broke his old banjo strings, 
Which he lov'd, ' till he parted with breath 
I 
hear their dirge now sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
They lived and they died with the boys that they lov'd, 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band; 
The dear boys, the dear boys, 
The dear boys of the Minstrel Band. 
But now I 
must speak of the prince of them all— 
Who is that but our own gallant Dan 7 
Let ev'ry one mourn, for ' our chieftain is gone, 
Dan Bryant, the Minstrel and man ; 
Let all his praises be sounding, sounding 
In notes loud and clear thro' the land ; 
He liv'd and he died both our glory and pride, 
And the king of the Minstrel Band; 
He was king, he was king-, 
lie was king of the Minstrel Band.

HURRAH FOR THE MINSTREL BAND.— 
Concluded. 
There is also a 
name that is well known to fame— 
George Belmore the jocky so true! 
His last race is run, and the prize he has won— 
To the Judges his spirit it flew; 
I 
hear the people shouting, shouting 
As the Flying Scud passes the stand— 
The heat it is run, the gold cup is won, 
He has join'd the true Minstrel Band. 
He has joined, he has joined— 
He has joined the true Minstrel Band.

HERE I 
am an Irishman, 
As you can plainly see; 
I 
just came over from Ireland, 
From the county of Trallee ; 
When I 
landed in Castle Garden, 
On America's soil to tread, 
I 
was met by a 
fair-haired maiden, 
And this is what she said— 
Tra-la-la ! Tra-la-le! I'll meet you, pet, 
I'll meet you in the Park when the weather it is wet; 
I'll strike you with a 
turkey-leg, I'll smother you with the staf-
fing, 
For the darling of the ladies is Hilderbilbt McGuffin. 
Oh, when I 
was married about a 
year, 
I 
found to my great joy, 
My wife she made me a 
present 
Of a 
darling, bouncing boy ; 
And when at night he'd holler for his paregoric, 
Or any such thing, 
My wife she'd dance him up and down, 
And this is what she'd sing— 
Tra-la-la, Tra-la-le, e+4.-

TOPICS OF THE DAY. 
Ztinz with great success by JA3iEs BRADLZY. 
How I 
love to smoke, 
Yes, to smoke, to smoke, 
Or crack a 
lively joke, 
While feeling light and gay; 
They say pull down your vest, 
Go west with the rest, 
Or, Charley, throw out your chest, 
Are the topics of the day. 
CHORUS. 
How I 
adore to waltz, 
Yes, to waltz, to waltz, 
Or take a 
dose of salts, 
Are the topics of the day. 
SPoKE:f.—I 
was down town to- day, and I 
had quite a 
chat 
with the mayor. 
I 
asked him for a 
chew of tobacco; he asked 
me what kind I 
would have— tine cut or plug 
I 
told him I'd 
have plug. 
He gave me his high hat to chew on. 
I 
then 
jumped on the Bleecker street car; I 
slipped as I 
got on the 
steps; I 
told the conductor he ought to put something on the 
steps to keep people from slipping ; he said he would have put 
some salt on the steps if he thou7ht there was any fresh fellows 
getting aboard, 
Well. I 
rode up as far as the Clipper office, 
and I 
dropped off' there, and bought a 
Herald. 
I 
observed all 
the latest news on the bulletins by cable. 
That cable is a 
smart man; he knows what's going on in Europe. 
I 
saw that 
Spain had refused to interfere with the Brooklyn Bridge; that's 
a 
areat loss to cigar signs. 
I 
looked over the obituary column 
and I 
saw there was plenty of help wanted. " Wantea—a thin 
man to co down in soda water bottles and bring up corks." 
‘• Wanted—a 
man, must weigh two hundred pounds, to stand 
in front of a 
private dwelling to tie horses to him." 
I 
had a 
job like that myself one time; the boss stopped his horse and 
wagon in front of his door, and of course tied the horse to me. 
By and bye a 
band of music came by, the horse started: he was 
found in New Haven and I 
was found up at High Bridge. 
I 
gave up that situation. 
I 
cot a 
job down at the new- Post Of-
fice, standing near the window where the people buy stamps. 
All I've got to do k 
hold out my toncue and let people wet the 
stamps. 
I'm cortrtinc a

go 
to see every ni-ht, providinc her father and the bull dog are

Her name is Mary Ann O'Brien, 
her mother sold bananas, 
Her father earned a

By tuning up pianos; 
Her uncle was a

Her brother was musician, 
He carried a 
big bass drum.

W E'RE employed by the Government yearly, my friend, 
A

While a

The door bells we rinc,

There is a 
young damsel that lives on our post, 
If she looks for one letter she looks for a

She's cot a 
young fellow, I 
think he's a

He's as thin as a

She'll stand in the door with her small, dainty shoes, 
And waits for the postman to bring her cood news; 
He calls out her name, Sarah Jane Huches, 
Then she feels cheerful and gay.

O'er ocean's expanse the dark clouds arise, 
And storms in loud gusts sweep the waves; 
The tempest-tossed vessel right onward she flies,

For whatever his lot 'mid trouble and care,

At length when the perilous voyage is o'er, 
And the vessel at anchor safe lies,

Price 40 cents. 
TEE band was playing in the park 
One August evening fine, 
And crowds of promenaders gay 
Were marching by in line ; 
The fellows in full force were there, 
The girls were plenty, too, 
And with flirtations, chats, and such, 
All had enough to do. 
CHORUS. 
But I 
was harnessed to my love, 
Who now and then would say, 
" 
That lady seems to know you, George, 
Who is she, tell me, pray I" 
The ladies, bless the gentle doves, 
All seemed to bow to me, 
Which, with Louisa by my side, 
Did not at all agree; 
And one, believe it, nudged me hard, 
I 
did not know her name, 
Or even the direction which 
The little damsel came. 
But I 
was, eta.. 
I 
told my love that it was rude, 
For we'd ne'er met before, 
And then I 
said, " I'm sure she's not 
The style that I 
adore." 
Besides, I 
thought her impudent 
For doing such a 
thing, 
And then the band struck up the air 
My darling loved to sing. 
But I 
was, etc. 
I 
scarce had got the sentence out 
When, lo, behold! there stood 
A maiden throwing kisses just 
As fast as e'er she Could; 
She aimed them all at me I 
know, 
For in her roguish eye 
I 
saw ' twas her intention then 
To toss them on the sly.

But I 
was, etc.

" THAT LADY SEEMS TO KNOW YOU,

Apologize again I 
must 
To my Louisa fair, 
Lest she should think that I 
for her 
Did not the slightest care; 
I 
told her jokingly I 
thought 
The kisses flew too high 
For me or any other chap 
To catch them on the fly. 
But I 
was, etc. 
This rather- vexed the little one, 
She wanted to go home, 
She was " so tired and sleepy that 
She could no further roam ;" 
But ' ere we reached her domicile, 
A 
girl bewitching sweet, 
Said, as she passed aside us, " George, 
Next Sunday night we meet."

THEY have laid her to rest ' neath the willow, 
By the side of her mother and child; 
In summer birds sing sweetly o'er her, 
In winter the winds whistle wild ; 
Her form was as fair as the fairest, 
Her eyes were as blue as the sky, 
Oh, Gertie, my darling, my loved one, 
Why did you, why did youedie ? 
CHORUS. 
Her form was as fair as the fairest, 
Her eyes were as blue as the sky, 
Oh, Gertie, my darling, my loved one, 
Why did you, why did you die? 
Her lily white hands they were folded, 
A 
rose- red was placed on her breast, 
Her coffin was strewn with camelias 
The day that they laid her to rest ; 
Her sweet, gentle voice, how we miss it, 
And also her kind loving smile, 
Oh, Gertie, forever you've left us, 
Oh, why was it not for a 
while?

A CENTURY SINCE.I' 
Written by W ILLIAM DEVERE. 
Sung by B. 
M AGINLEY, 
AIR.—" Grandfather's Days." 
A CENTURY since times were warm for this Union, 
Things looked very dark for our country and home; 
The hand of the despot was hovering o'er us, 
While Liberty lay crushed and bleeding alone; 
But brave hearts and true rallied round our dear standard, 
And struck a 
strong blow for Columbia's defence, 
And the Fourth of July told a 
wonderful story 
That lives in our hearts now, a 
century since. 
A 
century since we had no carpet-baggers, 
No whiskey- ring business, no free-lover school— 
'co railroads, no steamboats, no telegraph cable, 
No White- Leagues or Ku Klux to rule by misrule; 
The girls didn't know NN hat was meant by crusaders— 
They would not do wrong under any pretence, 
And there were no preachers like Henry Ward Beecher, 
They've all came to light in this century since. 
There were no politicians to howl or to bluster, 
But every man knew he'd a 
duty to do; 
They shouldered their guns and they went to the muster, 
Determined to stand by the Red, White, and Blue; 
There was Lafayette, Putram, Gates, Green, and Decatur, 
Lee, Perry, and Lawrence, who stood in defence 
Of the emblem bequeathed us, the flag of our country, 
George Washington's gift, a 
century since. 
A 
blessing upon our Centennial meeting, 
May the voices that saw,- in old Faneuil Hall 
Be heard in the old bell now sounding a 
greeting 
To each Foreign Nation, a 
welcome to all; 
May peace and prosperity hover above us, 
At Liberty's shrine we will burn our incense ; 
May we never forget those great heroes before us, 
Who died for their country a 
century since.

There is just complaint among teachers and parents who take an interest in 
the culture of youth, because of the very few books that exist containing first 
class Dialogues for two or more speakers. 
Most of this class of books are 
mere repetitions of books printed scores of years ago; while others omit all 
old ones, however good, and fill their places with weak, wishy-washy pieces 
merely because they are new. In this series the aim has been to select the 
Bast, whether new or old—pieoes as fresh as daisies and as bright as stars.
