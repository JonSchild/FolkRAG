So, we are making history and we are having our say [chuckles]. So, how are you today?

I'm doing well, thank you. Would you give us your complete name?
MH
Michael David Harrington.
CH
What year were you born?
MH
1959.
CH
Where were you born?
MH
Columbus, Ohio.
CH
Okay, okay. What state do you live in now?
MH
Currently I live in San Antonio. Excuse me. I live in Texas.
CH
Okay, but which part? You can tell me the part.
MH
San Antonio, Texas.
CH
Okay. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. Tell me something about your family.
MH
So, such as...
CH
Your mother, your father, your sister, your brother. You're married. You're single.
3
afc2021009_012
MH
Okay, so I am married. I've been married 37 years now. Both my parents are deceased. I am the second
oldest of eight. I have six sisters and one brother. I have also lost a sister, so I have seven sisters now.
CH
Who or what inspired you to become a nurse?
MH
Well, so truthfully, what inspired me to become a nurse was as a little boy, I always wanted to be a
doctor. My goal in life was to be Doctor Ben Casey. I don't know a lot of people remember him, but I
wanted to be a gentleman like Dr. Ben Casey. As growing up in Columbus, Ohio, I was a single parent.
So, my mother and father divorced when I was very young and all my siblings came along there
afterwards. So, due to being socially and economically depressed, due to not having a regular doctor, we
went to this place in Columbus, Ohio called Eco Family Health Center. It was two white ladies, actually,
that took me and my brothers and sisters in, and we decided that whenever we had an appointment, we
would always go see them. Her name was Marilyn, actually, and so she even took us over her house. We
spent the night over her house. She showed us when the first 15-speed bicycles came out and then that
led one thing to another. Later on, as I became older and went to school and stuff, I decided that I was
gonna join the military. Once again, as a kid, I always wanted to be a doctor. That was my goal. So,
when I got into the military, I took the ASVAB test, and when I got in, I wanted to leave right away
because I was homeless, actually, so what I did was I decided that I was gonna join the military.
[Inaudible 3:38] right away I wanted to be a cop, and since I scored well on the ASVAB test, the
gentleman told me, "No, you should do something else." So then I said, “Well, I’ll go to medical-- I'll
do-- hospital.” So, I became a corpsman, and then there from a corpsman, later on in life I wanted to get
my commission. It elected me, it chose me to want to be a nurse since I couldn't go to medical school at
that time, and that's what brought me to become a nurse.
CH
Tell me about your educational path. You went to nursing school in the military?
MH 04:31
I am the second oldest of eight in my family. I always had ambitions of being a doctor. That was my
goal in life, to be a doctor, as I said, mentioned before, from Dr. Ben Casey. For me, I didn't go to school
per se, so I didn't get all the education as all the other students did. So, I was busy working. In 10th grade
[inaudible 4:59] put me in jail for truancy. I'm gonna back up a little bit. We were so poor that I didn't go
to school. I used to shovel people's yards when we had snow in Columbus, Ohio. I'd put socks on my
hands, but we didn't have gloves. I had my little red shovel. I would charge 50 cents a yard, just to get
enough food so we can eat. So, eat baked beans, you know, wieners, is what our meals consisted of. If I
didn't get out there and work, we really wouldn’t have nothing to eat, so therefore, I didn't go to school
and whenever it's snowed or leaves on the ground, I was out there. I was out there hustling, trying to
make money so we could eat. Later on as I got older, my mother married my stepfather. They went their
separate ways. My mother really didn't allow me to be part of the family because I was tired of being
poor. I was tired of doing without. So, what I did was I told my mother, "I want to go live with my father
in Los Angeles, California." I got on a Greyhound bus. For three days, I traveled to Los Angeles,
California. I get to Los Angeles, California. I'm there with my father. I’m in Los Angeles, Hollywood,
you know. Fast cars, all the good stuff, the glamorous stuff. My father was an alcoholic. I went to
4
afc2021009_012
Dorsey High School. I never looked my age. I always looked younger than my age, so even though I
was 17, I looked like I was 14, 13. Going back to my father, he was always drunk, wobbling down the
street, urine stains in his pants. I was so embarrassed, so I decided I didn't want that lifestyle. My sister
had joined the Navy. We went to Lemoore, California. She lived in Lemoore, California. I decided that I
was going to go live with her. I went to go live with her. She was having marital problems, so I got back
on the Greyhound bus. I moved three days. I drove back to Columbus, Ohio. I had no food, nothing to
eat. I would go to the store, but when the bus stopped, I would take a dollar. If I saw a tip on the table, I
would take a dollar. I would take a tip, a dollar, off the table. I would get me a Snicker bar and a soda, a
Sprite, and that's what I survived those three days traveling back to Columbus, Ohio. When I get back to
Columbus, Ohio, my mother had remarried my stepfather, and at that time, they didn't want me there in
the house. As my mother said, I ran away from home, which I didn’t. I left due to I was tired of other
stuff that was going on and I didn't want to be a part of that. I wanted to live a normal life. So, I lived 15
miles from my parents. Let me recant. Let me go back. So, when I got off the Greyhound bus, my
mother had a car. We never had a car before. My stepfather got my mother a car. I called my mother,
told her I was there. She said, “Well, figure out how to get home.” So, I couldn't go back to their home
so I walked to Columbus, Ohio. I had an aunt lived on Gilbert Avenue. I walked to Gilbert Avenue to my
aunt's house and that's where I lived 'til I finished high school. I was a half a credit short in high school
so I had to repeat another year in high school because I was short in English. Once again, I went to
school but I still didn't have no-- my grades were terrible. I came out of high school, like I said-- I don't
know if I mentioned this. When I graduated from high school, my GPA was 0.967. I was so ashamed of
that, but that's what it was. To this day, I always think about that our school system, no one came and
talked to me. No one came to see if I was-- what was going on or took the time to-- took the initiative to
say, "Hey, you're gonna go to college?" this or that, that, this. They never did. So, I luckily joined the
military through help from my recruiters to this day, which I am truly blessed and truly humble, because
without them, I wouldn't ever be where I'm at in my life today. They helped me so much in so many
ways that I don't want to explain at this time, but they helped me, got me into the service. Like I said, I
was homeless, so I told the recruiter I wanted to join-- When I took the ASVAB February 11, 1978, I
told him I wanted to join the service the next day ‘cause I had nothing. Once again, I still wanted to be a
doctor, so they said, "You wanna go with something in the medical field?" I said, "Sure," and then he
told me-- he showed me, "Oh, you'd be a nurse's aide." I said, "I'll do it." I said, “Will I leave
tomorrow?” He said, "No, you gotta wait six months." So, I waited six months. I had off-and-on jobs. I
waited six months. I've always been blessed. I'm gonna go back a little bit. I worked at two boys clubs in
Columbus, Ohio. I worked at the rich white boys club and I worked at the ghetto boys club. The ghetto
boys club, I mean, they loved me to death. I got along with them good, but they still kind of picked on
me a little bit. But at the rich white boys club, at that time it was called [inaudible 10:45] Boys Club, I
was making like 2.50 a hour as I was making a dollar a hour at the-- There was [inaudible 10:53]. It was
through-- funding through the government for six months or six weeks, something like-- 12 weeks I
think is what it was. So, [inaudible 11:00] and I made ends meet while stayed with my aunt until I joined
the military. Then, once I joined the military, like I said, I became a medic. I promised God that
whatever I do, I'll do my best and be successful. I got in the service; I was a medic. I had my struggles. I
did something that never happened before while I was in the Air Force. During one of my blocks, I
failed block five but I passed block six. Normally, if you fail your block, they'll kick you out, but I
passed block six but I failed block five because they didn't have time enough to recycle me. So, they
recycled me to take block five and then from there on, once again, I promised God I will do my best
whatever I do. So, as years progressed, I did eight years enlisted. Once again, I decided I was gonna go
back to medical school. So, when I got out of the service, I went to medical school. I attempted medical
5
afc2021009_012
school at University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and I got all D’s my first semester. Then, I'm
thinking, I'm supposed to be smart but why I’m not doing well? I was talking to some of my classmates
and when I realized some of them knew what the Krebs cycle was, I didn't know what a Krebs cycle was
because, once again, they learned all that in high school and the curve was too big for me. I had too
much to learn, too much to try to grasp at that period of time. So, once again, I decided that if I was still
in the military, I would still be a nurse or medical, like a nurse. I want to be a nurse. So, that's what
decided me to become a nurse, and so I changed my major and everything else was good from there.
CH
You went to nursing school as a civilian or as an airman?
MH
I went to nursing school as a civilian.
CH
Where did you go?
MH
I started out at University of New Mexico and then I graduated from University of South Florida in
Tampa.
CH
What degree did you get?
MH
I got a Master of Science in Nursing.
CH
Have you continued your nurse education?
MH 13:20
I haven't continued. I rejoined the military. I did a year, two years of cardiac step down and then I went
to OR, so I spent majority of my time as a OR nurse.
CH
An OR nurse.
MH
Yes, as an OR nurse.
CH
Tell me something about that experience. OR stands for operating room nurse
MH
Yes ma’am, that’s right. Operating room nurse. That was very, very good, very enjoyable, fast-paced. I
deployed twice to Iraq. I went to Iraq during the busiest time of the-- in theater during the war. I saw all
6
afc2021009_012
kinds of injuries. You name it, I saw it. It was good. It's fast-paced. When I came back, my primary
specialist was-- I like ophthalmology, so I did eyes and I did ENT, and so I love those areas.
CH
ENT is Ear, Nose and Throat.
MH
Ear, Nose and Throat. Yes ma’am.
CH
Those were specialties that you worked in?
MH
Those were the specialties that I worked in.
CH
Did you work in a clinic setting or in the hospital?
MH
In the hospital, in the OR.
CH
Okay. Okay, so this was still operating room experience. Have you ever worked at the bedside?
MH
Yes, I have. It's ironic. So, I'm gonna go back a little bit. My wife was in the service as well, and so once
I graduated, my wife got orders to Misawa, Japan, and so while we were in Misawa, Japan, I had to find
some kind of nursing to keep my skills up so I became a OB nurse.
CH
Okay. OB stands for…
MH
Obstetrics.
CH
Okay.
MH
Labor and Delivery, etcetera. So, I did that for two years and then I joined the military, Air Force, in
1999, and then I retired in 2011.
CH
Retired from…
7
afc2021009_012
MH
Air Force.
CH
Okay, so how many years did they give you in the Air Force?
MH
In total, I did a total of 26 years.
CH
And retired.
MH
And retired, yes.
CH
Working in, you said, theater in Iraq…
MH
In Iraq, yes ma’am.
CH
Theater means that you were working where they were having the war?
MH
Yes ma’am.
CH
So, war activity?
MH
Yes ma’am.
CH
What was it like being a nurse working in the theater?
MH
I was very proud. We helped a lot of people, because in theater not only did we help Americans, we
helped third world country people and we also helped the Iraqis, the good versus the bad. So, you know,
we took care of everyone in the war. It’s very high tempo. The arrangement was-- How can I put it? I'm
not gonna say horrible ‘cause I don't wanna say that, but it was like, you know, like war, like you were in
war. It was scary. It was, yeah, everything that comes with war. It was like that. What you see in Ukraine
is how it was.
CH
So, the hospital setting was right on the battlefield?
8
afc2021009_012
MH
So, our hospital setting was not right on the battlefield but it was surrounded by the battlefield, so we got
mortared. Bombs came over every day, every day.
CH
Never hit the hospital, though?
MH
Never hit the hospital. Came close, but never hit the hospital.
CH
How did that affect you?
MH
It was, you know, I always said my prayers, always prayed and, you know, it just, you know, it didn't
affect me one way or the other. I was gonna do my job no matter who it was, what it was. I was gonna
try to make the world a better place, so I was gonna do my job.
CH
After you retired from the military, you continued your nursing career in what area?
MH
Okay, after I retired from the military, I worked in an orthopedic clinic. First, I did a little bit of OR and
then the contract got suspended because funding and everything of that nature, so then I became an
orthopedic nurse. I did that for two and a half years. Then, I stopped that and I became a case manager.
Then, I worked at one of the local hospitals here in San Antonio. Then, now I'm back for the military at
BAMC.
CH
BAMC is…
MH
Brooke Army Medical Center.
CH
Brooke Army Medical Center. Not the VA.
MH
Not the VA. Not the VA.
CH
What do you do at BAMC?
MH
At BAMC, I'm a case manager.
9
afc2021009_012
CH
What do case managers do?
MH
Pretty much what case managers do, it’s nothing like the OR, but what we do is we see to it that people,
if they need medical equipment, if they need home health, if they need rehab, lately if they need a ride
home, we help them. We help facilitate to-- help move them, get them the service that they need while
they're in the hospital and see, too, that they get the service that they need when they're out of the
hospital to keep them from coming back into the hospital.
CH
You only do the inpatient side?
MH
Yes ma’am. I'm strictly inpatient. At Brooke Army Medical Center, my job, even though I am a case
manager, currently I'm strictly on active duty, so I take care of all the active duty personnel. So, all the
people, all the active duty personnel that are in the military, I take care of them. All branches of the
military, which means Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine, Coast Guard.
CH
Active duty. So, there's two parts. There's the active duty and non-active duty for BAMC?
MH
Yes ma’am. You got the active duty personnel and then you got the people that are retired and their
dependents.
CH
Okay. What challenges have you faced since the COVID pandemic as far as being a case manager?
MH 19:54
What I have faced is that a lot of people that had have COVID, a lot of active duty, how it affects them.
And you know, it is scary to see people on ECMO. It's scary to see people, you know, losing their life
over this illness, so it affects-- I mean, it really affects you, ‘cause you're thinking about yourself. You
think about how it can easily be you, instead of-- you know, you, yourself.
CH
Did that experience change your practice as a nurse at all?
MH
No. Once again, I always want to do my best and my goal is to get to heaven. So, my goal is to do my
best and do unto others as I want others do unto me.
CH
You're really a man of faith.
10
afc2021009_012
MH
I try to be. I try to be, and I always want to set a good example.
CH
Do you feel that being a person of faith makes you a better nurse?
MH
Well, I think you have to be in order to be a nurse. You have to be compassionate. You have to be caring.
You have to believe in God and a higher being. You have to, because so much stuff that you see out
there, yeah.
CH
As a male nurse, do you feel that you have faced any adverse treatment because you're a male nurse in
your career?
MH
You said “adverse”. Can you explain that a little bit?
CH
Have you met with any stereotypes as far as being a male nurse? Do people treat you different because
you're a male nurse?
MH
I'm not gonna say they treat me different. In the military, you can get away with that because of your
rank, so it's a little different. So, from my experience in that, no, because that rank speaks for itself.
CH
Okay. Were you an officer?
MH
I was a officer. So, they have to speak to your rank. But now, I will say this. There was a time when I'm
out in public and people ask me what I did. I might not say, "Oh, I work in a hospital." I might not
necessarily tell them that I'm a nurse because there might be prejudice. They might say, "Oh," you know,
"you might be, you know, things are not right," you know. "Why are you a nurse?" But as I got older and
matured about it, I have no shame. So, yeah, I'm a nurse and I'm proud of it. I'm proud that I'm a nurse.
I'm proud and I try to represent and try to set for people to follow. There's always people watching, so if
I do a good example or set a good example, I might treat someone else to do the same.
CH
How long have you been a nurse?
MH
Oh boy. When you say a nurse now, you're talking about a nurse, nurse or you’re talking about…
CH
About registered.
11
afc2021009_012
MH
Registered nurse. Okay, so I graduated in 1996, so I want to say that-- I should do my math, but I want
to say that 26 years; 26, 27 years.
CH
And you've been in the nursing field for…
MH
I've been in the nursing field since 1978.
CH
Okay, that's a pretty long time. Have you faced any type of prejudice or inequality as an African
American nurse?
MH
Okay, let's see. I want to say through my years, I'm gonna say probably twice. I had an incident once, not
too long ago, where I was taking care of a patient and the patient's-- some of the family members, or
friends of a family member, told me that they did not like minority people per se, you know. They were
uncomfortable with a minority person. For me, the way I tackle that is I always say I'm gonna be honest.
I always said that I have good bedside manners and I'm not gonna let that taunt me or-- I'm gonna be
myself. And, you know, I'm not trying to win ‘em over, but I'm just gonna be myself and let the chips lay
where they lay. So, in the end, the person respected me and thanked me and was very appreciative of
me. But so, I've had that happen probably in my career two or three times, no more than that.
CH
Do you feel that male nurses have better opportunities to advance into management and administration
over a female nurse?
MH
I'm gonna say at this point in time, maybe not per se, and the reason why I feel that ‘cause there's more
women in the position so there’s more women that are ahead of the gentlemen. I'm not gonna say
because of skill level or anything of that nature, just that there's more women that have been in there
longer than more men has been, and I think that affects that. But I'm not gonna say no. Me, I have six
sisters. I think everyone's equal. Everyone's equal to do the job.
CH
Wonderful. Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated. What chapter and what region do you belong to?
MH 25:33
Okay, I belong to the Theta Eta chapter here in San Antonio, Texas.
CH
Which region?
MH
Oh, middle south.
12
afc2021009_012
CH
Middle south region.
MH
Middle south, middle south.
CH
Alright. How long have you been a member?
MH
I'm going on my second year.
CH
Oh, so you are new. You’ve just come out of what we call the neophyte.
MH
I just came out of neophyte.
CH
Who invited you to come in? Was it somebody you knew personally?
MH
I want to say it was Sandra Carr.
CH
Okay. Did you work with her or…
MH
I worked with her when I was stationed at [inaudible 26:17].
CH
Okay. Does she work there as well?
MH
No, she's moved off and went to Alaska.
CH
Oh, wow! Being a part of Chi Eta Phi Sorority Incorporated, what type of service projects have you been
a part of?
MH
I don't like to toot my horn so I'm not one to brag. I like to be humble, mild, meek, and, you know, let
my actions show for myself. And so, I did this one project that I did on my own prior to, and I did it this
past year with the help of Chi Eta Phi, of course, my chapter. So, I wanted to give back to some poor
families. I wanted to give them turkeys, so I raised probably $2,500 worth. I went to our local store here.
I bought-- I averaged between 16- and 20-pound turkeys. So, we passed out probably 240 turkeys to
13
afc2021009_012
family, hopefully family in need. I wanted to give back that way because, once again, I never forget
where I came from. And so growing up, people helped me and I want to help someone else. I believe
that if you help one person it's like helping a million. So, that's one of my charities that I have done.
CH
Have you held any office, local, regional or national?
MH
Oh no, ma'am. Not yet, maybe.
CH
Do you aspire to run for anything?
MH
Well, truthfully, I'm kind of bashful, so I don’t like to, you know. I worry about things, so I don't know if
I'm worthy of it.
CH
You don't want to be in the limelight.
MH
Right.
CH
You know that leadership is one of the principles that we believe in in Chi Eta Phi, so you are
encouraged to step out there and be a leader [chuckles].
MH
Yes, but I want to be a quiet leader, you know, lead by example.
CH
Do you feel that Chi Eta Phi makes a difference in service for humanity?
MH
I certainly do.
CH
And how?
MH
I think by them giving and always out in the community. Like, our local chapter here reached out to San
Antonio about the COVID vaccine and they pushed it. They went out and did it. So yes, they're
constantly trying to help, help the community, help, you know, help people get along, help people better
themselves. So, you're absolutely right. I do believe they do.
14
afc2021009_012
CH
Do you all service a certain population or demographic?
MH
Well, I think we do but I think we target everyone.
CH
Okay. What are your thoughts on the future of nursing?
MH 29:48
I think it's gonna keep growing, keep evolving. I think that we'll have more and more autonomy is gonna
come out of this. I think we're in good hands. I think we're in very good hands, and so I think we'll be
fine. We’ll do well. Nursing will do well.
CH
Do you feel that the male population in nursing is going to grow?
MH
Oh yes, most definitely it’s gonna grow, and I think when that grows, I hate to say this, that's gonna even
better help the nursing profession.
CH
In what way?
MH
I think economically, I think [inaudible 30:30]. I think they gonna be listened to ‘em more so. I think all
that's gonna be on the up and up due to the more males. I hate to say this, but [inaudible 30:40], how our
society is. But yes, I think it is gonna happen.
CH
So, the increase in male nurses will increase and make the profession better, as far as opportunities and
economically.
MH
Yes ma’am. I believe that, yes.
CH
What would you say to a young man who is thinking about pursuing nursing as a profession?
MH
I would most definitely tell them to go for it. I would tell them that nursing, you have so many
opportunities to do a lot of other things. You can be a nurse. When I mean a nurse, you could be a nurse
anesthetist. You could be a NP. You can work in the GI. You can work in all these specialty skills.
Radiation. There's a lot of specialties that you can get involved in and that you can do in nursing, so the
door’s wide open.
15
afc2021009_012
CH
So, you feel that nursing is a lucrative career?
MH
It is lucrative. Lucrative and very rewarding.
CH
Okay. Rewarding in what way?
MH
Because when you help one person and you see that and they come back and thank you, I mean, I just
can't say enough how that feels. It might not necessarily be money. Just a thank you is more than
enough. Then you did your job. You did your purpose.
CH
Any other advice that you could give to a young man who's thinking about coming into nursing?
MH
If you feel like there's a stereotype against nursing, there's not. There's no stereotype in nursing. It’s
open. It's for everyone. It's good. I am grateful. I am humble. I thank God every day that I am a nurse. I
think about all the success I have made through my life by being a nurse. I think about all the people that
I have touched and all the people that have touched me during my nursing career. So, I'm very honored
and very privileged for being a nurse, being a male nurse. I have no shame.
CH
That’s great. When you went back to nursing school as a civilian, did you use any of the benefits from
the military to finance your education?
MH
Yes and no. Yes, I did and no, I didn't. I used up all my benefits trying to become a doctor and stuff, so I
ran a little short on money, but I used my Pell grants and all that other stuff.
CH
You said you went-- you actually went to medical school?
MH
So, excuse me, not medical school, but I actually went to pre-meds.
CH
Okay, pre-med.
MH
Pre-med.

CH
Okay, so you-- pre-med, and then from pre-med, you went over to nursing and you were successful at
that point?
MH
Yes.
CH
A person who may be struggling with their nurse education, what advice would you give them?
MH
Okay, so my advice I would give them is always keep your head up. Do your best. Try and talk to your
instructors. I am proof of that. I'm going to say never quit. I never quit. I'm gonna bring something else
up that I didn't want to bring up but I'm gonna bring it up. So, when I went to nursing school in
University of New Mexico, my grades was horrible. Oh, no, excuse me. When I went to pre-med, my
grades were horrible, so I asked for appeal. They granted my appeal. I had a new slate. I started over. I
started off and I was gonna be a physical educator. Then, one morning I woke up and said, “No, I don't
want to do that.” I said, “I want to be a nurse,” and so I switched midstream. I was about ready to
graduate from-- In that time, it's called physical educator, phys. ed. Now it's called Kinesiology. So, I
said, “I'm gonna switch. No, I wanna be a nurse.” So, I switched, did everything again. Took all my
science courses and got into the program. I was worried that I wasn't gonna get into the program, but I
did get into the program at University of New Mexico. Then, my wife got transferred to MacDill Air
Force Base. While we were there, in the middle screen, the middle of the year, I happened to go there.
When I went there, I sat there, and to this day, I'm gonna say her name, Dr. Pat Gorski. She was the
professor that helped me get into the school. She said, “You know what? You're in luck. We got a kid,
another kid, that didn't make the program. We're gonna put you in his slot.” So, that's how I got in his
slot. Now, did I have trouble there? I did. The trouble I had was, at University of South Florida in Tampa
was there wasn't that many minority students there, meaning there wasn't that many Black students
there. So, for me, when I went to that program, I remember one of the professor, a Black professor, came
to me and said, “Whatever you do, keep quiet. Do your work. Watch the other students ‘cause they
gonna have exams, question how to study,” you know. “Get friends with them. That will help you get
through the program.” But I never did that because I was too busy on my own because I was afraid. So, I
kept to myself. Now, as the year progressed, there was another kid there. He was from Jamaica and I
was from United States. He being from Jamaica and I'm from the United States, I can say I was the first
African American to graduate from University of South Florida. The school has been existing since
1974. So, at the time that I graduated, I was the first African American.
CH
Made some more history there.
MH 37:17
Right, but my friend, he was from Jamaica, who happened to graduate, he graduated before me, per se,
but he was from Jamaica. So, I had a little incident that happened to me when I was in nursing school.
Once again, I persevered. I had an instructor tell me that-- So, when I went to school, since my English
and my-- I'm not a good writer, so even to this day, I don't like to write. So, I went to the school-- One of
the professor told me that I wasn't gonna make it through the program. One of the lady that--
17
afc2021009_012
CH
The nursing program?
MH
The nursing program.
CH
This was a Caucasian instructor?
MH
Yes, instructor. She said I wasn't gonna make it through the program ‘cause of my writing skills, but the
lady that helped me get into the school happened to be Caucasian. She came to me and she said, “Oh,
you're gonna make it. You're gonna do well. Don't worry about that.” So, in essence, I had to sit out
another year because I failed a class. The class that I failed was not a non-nursing class, research, once
again, research, where I had to go to that instructor and I had to write. So, they made me jump through
all these crazy hoops and everything but I didn't, you know. I was very upset, but I said, “I just want to
make it through the program.” So, to answer your question, we say, what would I tell another Black
student about-- Black male going to nursing school? Don't let them hold that against you. Push through
it. I pushed through. Once again, I always say I want to set an example. So, I made it through the
program, and I'll never forget that professor told me. Now, my goal was to-- I wanted to get honors. So, I
made honors a couple of times, but I wanted to be the nursing honors. So, I really wanted that badly,
which I never obtained it because I saw other stuff going on to me that wasn't right, but I never said
nothing. Once again, I just pushed through. So, when I graduated from nursing school, when I
graduated, I remember that same professor that allowed me to join the program, she came up to me. She
said, “Michael, if you woulda went to FAMU, if you woulda went to another Black college--” There’s
FAMU. There's other colleges that are Black, I just can’t think of them right now. She said, “If you
woulda went there, would you have graduated with honors?” and I said, “Yes, would’ve,” and she said,
“Yes, you would have.” So, once again, I knew what she was telling me, but it's just that, you know,
what can I do? So, with that I'm saying, I would tell the students, “Never give up.”
CH
Perseverance is key.
MH
Perseverance is the key, yes. Push through.
CH
Any other experiences at the school as far as you being an African American student that might have
deterred you from pursuing your goal?
MH
No, no, ‘cause I always believed in myself and, you know, I had my family, my wife, you know. I had
people that were-- influence me still, you know. I wanted to graduate. I wanted to do this.
CH
Did you ever get any help with your writing?
18
afc2021009_012
MH
So, what I did was-- In Florida, you gotta pass this thing called a class, C-L-A-S-T, and so there's parts
you have to pass. So, I had to take that numerous times and, you know, and I was frustrated with it
because, you know, to me I mean, right, it’s important, but my everything else was good. Just that my
writing was bad and that one professor homed in on that. She homed in on it.
CH
So, you had another professor when you took research again?
MH
Yes, I did. I sure did. I sure did. I had another professor.
CH
But you were able to pass at that point?
MH
I was able to pass.
CH
What about taking the nursing licensure? Did you pass the first time you took it?
MH
I passed the first time. That was pretty funny, too. I was so nervous when I took that test. So, whenever I
was in school, whenever I went to take my test, I would always wear a tie. So, whenever I took a test, I
always tell myself, “look sharp, be sharp,” and so I will always wear a tie. So, the day of my test, I took
my test, I went to the gas station. I needed to get gas. So, I was so in a big hurry, I filled up my gas tank
and I drove off and I left the gas knob in the tank. and I heard this clunk, clunk, clunk and I looked. It
was the knob to the gas thing. I forgot to put it back [inaudible 42:27]. I was so in a big hurry to get
there and so worried about-- thinking about that test. But I took that test. I took the seventy-five
questions and it cut off. Yeah, took the seventy-five questions and then it cut off, and the rest was
history.
CH
Yes, so all of your trials and tribulations ended up in success.
MH
Yes ma’am.
CH
And that is a great testament to somebody that if you persevere, you can do it.
MH
You can do it. My goal was to have a 3.0 GPA, and ‘cause my GPA in high school was 0.967, and so that
was my goal. So, for me, my 3.0 was a 4.0, but I never said anything to anyone about that.
19
afc2021009_012
CH
You did have a 3.0 when you finished nursing school? That's quite an achievement.
MH
Yeah, that was my goal.
CH
Quite an achievement and congratulations to you for persevering. Finally, here, what are your thoughts
on our beloved Chi Eta Phi and your words of wisdom towards service for humanity?
MH
To me it’s like it says, service for humanity. I mean, to me, you do the extra mile. You give yourself,
your love, your respect and you treat other people with dignity and you honor God, you know. So, to me,
that is service before self and excellence in all we do.
CH
I want to thank you so much for taking time out of your busy day and sharing this part of Cinco de Mayo
with me here in the beautiful city of San Antonio, Texas. I will certainly be in touch with you when we
get published and I just thank you so much again.
MH
Thank you.
