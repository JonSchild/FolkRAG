CASH, CASH, CASH. 
As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE IT UGHEF. 
Some poets write of woman sweet, and some of clever men, 
Some advise hard cash to us, some greenbacks is their plan, 
Some will sing of lovely lips, some of eyes of blue, 
But I 
will sing of one sweet thing, that's loved by all of you. 
CHORUS. 
For of course I 
am alluding to the cash, cash, cash, 
Nothing half so handy as the cash, cash, cash, 
Tot can do without a

Everything that is nice! 
But sometimes she's as hot as the mustard pot,

Sometimes she plays the lion's part,

SWEETHEARTS. 
As sung with great siweess by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
" 
Oh, take this tlow'r, dear love !“ said he, 
He spake with a 
tearful sigh; 
That night lie was going across the sea, 
II And this was his last good-bye! II 
She took the gift with a 
mocking 
In the flush of her maiden pride ; 
With heartless guile she dallied awhile. 
II Then threw the flow'r aside! 
Cirout-s. 
Oh, love, for a 
year, a 
xveek, a 
day. 
But, alas ! for the love that loves alway. 
" 
Give me a 
flow'r, dear love 
said he, 
She threw the flow'r he craved; 
"Now, by the love that. I 
have for thee, 
My breaking heart is sav'd 
lie kiss'd it once with a 
tender sigh, 
And treasur'd it near his heart ; 
" 
Tho' years roll by, this flow'r and I. 
II Shall never, never part I" II 
Criout:s.-011. love, &c. 
They met again in after years. 
In life's sad, sorrowful time ; 
Their heads were heavy with age and tears, 
And white with the winter rime! 
He found the ilow'r she scorn'd in play, 
At her faithful Aeart did ' well I 
His tlow•r dley say he had cast away, 
Before its petals fell. 
Ctiont-s.—Oh, love, Ste. 
As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
In Harlem it was once my fate to see four little boys, 
Who, trying to enjoy themselves, kicked up an awful noise 
The game they played was one which I 
had never seen before 
But what drew my attention was to hear these urchins roar. 
CIIOR us. 
Hi Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig, 
Jig, jig, jig, jig, jig, jig, 
Classical language, don't you twig, 
Hi Cockalorum, jig, jig, jig. 
Returning to my friends to dine, I 
being a 
good young man, 
They asked me if I'd say the grace before the meal began, 
All eyes were closed, each head was bent, hands clasped in 
style devout, 
I 
meant to say it proper, but instead I 
blurted out. 
Now, after this, most strange to say, the phrase ran in may 
bead, 
And though I 
tried to banish it, it never, never fled ; 
I 
took to drink, I 
tried the turf, balls, concerts, or the play, 
But no odds what the music was, to me it seemed to say. 
Coekalorum, &e. 
Each girl who used to think me nice, soon put me down a 
bore, 
Instead of warm receptions, I 
was cooly shown the door, 
At every such rebutl; of course, I 
asked the reason why 
And each bewitching damsel said in accents sweetly shy. 
Cuoaus.—Hi Cockalorum, 
HIS FADER KEEPS A BREWERY. 
As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
Oh, I 
just feel so very had now, und I 
don't know vat de 
matter vas, 
Only didn't I 
vas lonely, since Charlie vent avay; 
But he told me dat he vas coming back, yen, I 
couldn't 
quite could tell exactly, 
But if he vas here now, oh, vouldn' t 
I 
feel gay. 
But I 
veep und I 
vail ven de ferry boat did sail, 
Over dare in Germany, his fader keeps a 
brewery. 
Oh, I 
just now had a 
letter from my schneider lettle Charlie, 
-Und he told me that he vas coining back in a 
vun two 
weeks all right, 
Und ven ve vas married be, ve vill live just like busy bees, 
Ye vill brew all day ze lager beer und drink it up all night. 
Cuowirs.—But I 
veep, &e. 
Charlie, he vas such a 
jolly boy, und he alvays vas so merry, 
like, • 
Und he told me such funny tings all of ze day; 
Und yen I 
vas had much griefs, und felt myself a 
pouting so, 
He vould put his arm around my vaist, und kiss deni all

THE SILVERY MOON IS BEAMING. 
As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
The silvery moon is beaming, 
Else would we not know ' twas night, 
And softly the stars are gleaming, 
Till darkness fades into light, 
The beautiful night discloses, 
A loveliness not of day, 
The zephyrs sighs to the roses, 
The nightingale trills his lay, 
Love, oh love, thou eanst ne' er be sleeping, 
On a 
night that was made for thee, 
The flowers a 
watch are keeping, 
And the winds faint on the lea! 
I 
too wait for thy coming sweetest, 
Ah! my darling when thou art near 
The moments are always fleetest, 
Then forget not I 
am here! 
If false the love vow thou'st taken, 
If false too thy soft low tone, 
And if by thee I'm forsaken, 
Unnoticed here and alone, 
Farewell to the sweet night laden, 
With passion told not to me, 
Farewell to night-bird and maiden, 
To starry sky, orange tree! 
Love, oh love of mine, yet believe me, 
Thou wert heaven and earth to me, 
But if thou dost but deceive me, 
Dark my world of love will be! 
No! thou' rt true, and thou' rt coining, sweetest; 
Ah I 
my darling thou art near, 
And with loving smile thou .
greetglit,

STOP AS LONG AS YOU USED TO. 
As sung with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
I 
know a 
jolly old bachelor, 
Who lives next door to me, 
Though he is thought a 
bit of a 
bore, 
in jolly good company; 
For lie is such an inquisitive man, 
That if you e'er should meet, 
I [ ell butom-hole you i 
file can, 
And give you the following treat. 
Clionts.—Does your mother take in washing ? 
Has she sold her mangle '? 
What's become of the old piano, 
Your sister used to strangle ? 
Has your father plenty of work ? 
Does he still get boozed too ? 
Tell toe all the particulars, 
And stop as long as you used to. 
Now this old man has lots of wealth, 
So he's not without a 
few, 
Choice friends who'll call to drink his health, 
And borrow a 
pound or two; 
But the old, man cross-examines them so, 
That they're glad to get away, 
As rich as they came, and as out they go, 
With a 
grin on his face he will say. 
CHonus.—Does your mother, & c. 
This bachelor's blessed with a 
lovely niece, 
Ills heiress, so they say, 
So I 
thought I'd try to be in the piece, 
And told my love one day : 
"Oh! speak to my Uncle, sir," she said, 
" 
With his consent we'll wed," 
So I 
asked him if she could be my bride, 
When he drew me aside, and said. 
ClloRt7s.—Does your mother, &c. 
The ladies give him their sweetest smiles, 
And Hatter and coax him so, 
But he can see through their artful wiles, 
Though his knowledge he does not show, 
They make him presents of gloves and ties, 
And handkerchiefs white as snow, 
Which he will wave before their eyes, 
As he asks with a 
chuckle and crow. 
enonus.—Does your mother, & c.

i'rice, 40ets. 
Since first this world created was, 
The greatest pow'r of mind, 
Is wielded by the gentle sex, 
That lord it o'er mankind ; 
Since Mother Eve to Adam gave, 
The first sweet taste of sin, 
The husbands and the sweethearts have 
Been always taken in. 
CHORUS. 
These charming little creatures win, 
Your heart with but a 
glance, 
You're surely to be taken in, 
If you give a 
girl the chance. 
Don't talk to me of mighty deeds, 
Upon the battle field, 
Of soldiers and of statesmen great, 
Of men that would not yield, 
There never was produc'd a 
man, 
Who did so brave become, 
But that a 
girl when& er she lik' d. 
Could twirl him round her thumb. 
CHORUS.—These charming, S:c. 
A lady in the days of old, 
Did Sampson's whiskers shave, 
And Mrs. ,links in Modern times, 
Did Butler's vengeance brave; 
Miss -Walker wears the pantaloons, 
Her watchword is advance, 
And each sweet girl would d6 the same. 
Could she but get the chance.

THERE'S ONLY ROOM FOR ONE. 
AS 
Sung with great success by Miss JENNIE HUGHES. 
Some folks are always lecturing, 
There's greatness for us all, 
And say because they're doing well, 
There's room enough for all; 
Now I'm one of those fellows, who 
Dame Fortune seems to shun, 
And in this world I 
find somehow, 
There's only room for one. 
SPOKEN.—I 
really believe were I 
to go below and take a 
friend with 
me, the old Gentleman would say— 
CHORUS. 
There's only room for one, 
There's only room for one, 
It's not a 
lark, to be a 
mark, 
And hear the people all remark, 
There's only room for one, 
There's only room for one, 
But I 
am never one but number two, 
J.ust my luck. 
From boyhood up to man's estate, 
Ill luck has followed me, 
I 
mean you know, I've always been 
Not one, but two or three; 
If waiting for an omnibus, 
With a 
lady by my side, 
I'm safe to hear a 
fellow say, 
" 
There's room for one inside." 
SPOKEN.—And it so happens it is always the last Bus—and the rain's 
coming down in torrents so the girl steps inside—while I 
step outside 
on the roof—because the Conductor says— 
Cuoars.—There's only room, &-e. 
A moonlight walk upon the Thames, 
Embankment once I 
took, 
And met a 
lovely creature there, 
Who gave me such a 
look; 
We talked of love and sweet moonlight, 
Till hours passed away, 
And when I 
asked to see her home, 
The moon it seems to say. 
SPOKEN.—Beware young man—that girl is false—she is fooling you 
—she has given her heart to a 
Life Guardsman, and— 
CHORUS.—There's only room, ,
te. • 
At last I 
thought that married life, 
Was just the thing for me, 
So bought a 
wife and furniture, 
But they did not agree; 
The bed was small, my wife was not, 
And that each night I 
found, 
For when she moved she pushed me out, 
And lodged me on the floor. 
SPOKEN.-Bump-Why the deuce do you keep pushing me out of bed 
for ?—I 
have as much right there as you have—my dear the bed is 
small, and you know— 
CHORUS.—There's only room, & c,

THAT'S WHERE I 
KNOW YOU ARE RIGHT. 
As sang by JaNxiz Mu:arse. 
GOOD people I 
ask you to listen, 
And heed what I 
say in my song, 
Common sense is the best kind of tutor, 
It teaches us right from wrong. 
There's two ends you must know to a 
string, boys, 
So be careful when you tly your kite, 
Have a 
care that she don't go too high in the air, 
That's where I 
know you are right; 
Fair play is a 
jewel we must dearly prize, 
So be impartial, my boys, in a 
fight; 
You must always believe what you see with you're eyes, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Whenever you go on a 
pic-nic, 
Enjoy yourselves, have lots of sport. 
Take your girl, your father and mother; 
Good lager beer, sherry and port, 
Don't stand still and look like a 
quaker, 
Be merry, cheerful and bright, 
And when there's a 
dance, 
Bounce in for a 
chance, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
It's pleasure, my boys, that keeps us alive, 
So go in for fun day and night; 
Laugh and grow fat, don't look like a 
cat, 
What Would the Men do Without Us. 
Sung by JENNIE ENGEL. 
I'M going to sing you a 
song, 
Not very short or very long, 
And as to weather right or wrongs 
I'll tell you when I've done sir. 
It is about the sterner sex 
Who us ,oirls of ten will perplex 
And tease defy, deceive and vex, 
And think it very jolly, 
CHORUS. 
Oh you know its true, 
You can't deny what I 
tell you. 
For dont on us, of course you do! 
You could not do without us. 
When little girls, you often please. 
To take and dance us on your knees 
We pull your whiskers and we tease 
You near to desperation; 
But when we have much bigger grown, 
Just like the tender rose full blown, 
Oh ! don't you wish we were your own 
You lords of the creation. 
Oh! you, &G, 
And when we were wed, what jolly fun, 
We then take care of number one, 
Sharp as you are, you're often done, 
You can't deny it. I 
know. 
We do with you just as we will, 
And sometimes treat you very ill, 
But wit,1 all our faults you, aive us still, 
And will for evermore, 
Oh I 
you.,

Music by David Braham. 
Sung in Harrigan's great sketch, The Mulligan Guard Picnic. 
Copyright by A. J. FISHER, 1878. 
My Mary Anne's a 
teacher in a 
great big public school, 
She get's one thousand dollars every year, 
She has charge of all the .children, you'd never find a 
fool, 
For Mary gives them all the proper steer. 
Oh, she studied Greek and Latin, rearFrench and Timbuctoo, 
German, Spanish, Turk and Hindoostan, Portuguese, Irish 
and Jerusalem Hebrew; 
Such and education has my Mary Anne. 
CHORUS. 
She's a 
darling, she's a 
daisy, 
She's a 
dumpling, she's a 
lamb; 
You should hear her play the pi—an--a, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
My Mary Anne's a 
lady, no contemptible coquette, 
When I 
see her sure my heart goes in a 
drame ; 
She is thoroughly conversant wid the art of etiquette, 
And at cards she'd beat old Hoyle himself a 
game. 
Oh, she'd play you whist or cribbage, forty-fives or casino, 
And she'll dale the cards just like a gamblin man, poker 
peaknuckle, or Sanky oh Pedro, 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's a 
darling, & c. 
My Mary Anne's a 
dancer in the art of terpsichore, 
You should see her forward four and alamandi; 
She'd break up all the lumber that you'd put down on the floor, 
Such a 
heavy stepper is my Nfary Anne. 
Oh, she'd dance you the mazourka, a 
polka or quadrille, 
Reel or jig or shuffle in the sand, schottishe or the German you 
could'nt keep her still. 
Such an education has my Mary Anne. 
She's n, darling tt

Boston. 
Price 35 cents. 
I'm, sing of a 
band that used to play 
Music in the street, 
And if you heard it you would say 
It was anything but sweet. 
They all played different instruments, 
The music was the same, 
They were all one family, 
And Morgan was their name. 
CTIORITS. 
Johnny Morgan played the organ, 
The father beat the drum, 
The sister played the tambourine, 
The brother went porn, porn, porn—porn, porn, porn, 
All alone on an old trombone; 
The music was so sweet 
They often got a 
penny 
To go into another street. 
They used to say that Johnny was 
The smartest of them all, 
And round the area windows 
He would often make a 
call. 
His music was so lively, 
All the latest airs from France, 
The servant girls could not keep still, 
The music made them dance.

Now one day John he chanced to play 
Outside a 
lady's door, 
And the lady said she never heard 
Such music played before; 
It pleased her so, that you must know, 
She heavy sums would pay 
To John, to stand outside the house, 
And play to her all day. 
John Morgan played the, etc,. 
John played upon his instrument, 
And pleased the lady so, 
That when the time arrived to leave, 
She would not let him crc. 
She asked if he would marry her, 
Which John did very soon, 
Now on the organ Johnny Morgan 
Plays her many a 
tune.

Heartless, Faithless Benjamin, 
Written by 0. L. SrovrE, and sung by Miss JENNTP; HUGHES. 
I'M all the way from Jersey State, 
A 
simple girl I 
am you see, 
And my sad story I'll relate, 
If you will only list to me: 
'Tis about a ' alse and fickle man, 
Whose name I'll tell was Benjamin, 
But I 
called him now and then, 
Fickle-hearted, faithless Ben. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! fickle- hearted Benjamin, 
Oh ! faithless, heartless, truthless Ben, 
I 
had been happy with my friend, 
If I 
ne'er had met you, faithless Ben. 
He used to work in daddy's field, 
A mowing of the new- cut hay, 
And at nightfall we would meet, 
When dad and main had gone away. 
There in the clover on his knees, 
He vowed his heart was mine, and when 
His father's ships came o'er the seas, 
he'd take and make me Mrs. Ben. 
Oh ! fickle-hearted Benjamin, & e. 
But his vows to me were all a 
lie, 
His father had no ships at sea, 
And now I'm only left to sigh, 
For he has robbed both dad and me— 
Dad of his watch, me of my heart, 
And if I 
only meet him there. 
Yen see how I'll meak him smart, 
That cruel- hearted, faithless Ben. 
As sung by JENNIII II DGELBS. 
FOLKS says I'm growing querulous, a 
regular cross-grained 
patch, 
Because I'm troubled with the gout, and wear a wig—s 
scratch; 
But worse than that, they spread reports, 
they say they've 
heard from me, 
Which cause a 
deal of mischief, but with truth do not agree; 
I'm sure I 
never dreamt of such, it really makes me sad, 
To think,—what was I 
saying then ? my mem'ry is so bad. 
My mem'ry is so bad, it really makes makes me sad— 
To think what I 
was saying then? my mem'ry is so bad. 
Oh I 
remember, Tuesday, no, 'twas Wednesday thereabout, 
I 
heard on good authority, the President is coming out,— 
At opera, and at Concert to, his gracious Majesty 
Will smile upon his subjects true, as once it used to be; 
Now p'haps you think I 
made this up, which sounds like news 
most glad, 
I 
heard it,—though I 
can't say where, my mem'ry is so bad. 
Oh dear its very sad, it nearly drives me mad 
I 
can't tell where I 
heard it, for my mem'ry is so bad. 
I 
took a 
cab the other day, and told him where to go 
'Twas Saratoga or Niagara,—but I 
found myself at Troy, 
In vain I 
stormed, he coolly said,—" I'd bade him drive me 
there," 
24 
-brben 1, P
IT% dense excitement, I 
forgot to pay his fare! 
He might have asked politely, not in terms as he were mad, 
Then summoned me, I'd costs to pay—my mem'ry is so bad. 
He served me very bad, and no redress I 
had, 
The Magistrate said I 
must pay, since my mem'ry was 
so bad. 
I 
once fell over head dud hears in love, but even then, 
My great misfortune hauntel me—most wretched of all 
me; 
The day was fixed, I 
bought the ring, when dreadful to relate, 
I 
reached the Church, but found I came just two days after 
date, 
Of couse a Breach of Promise Case they brought, and so I 
had— 
Fiv44 Lundred dollars to pay, because my mem'ry is so bad. 
It really was too bad, to pay of course I 
had, 
wive hundred dollars, and all because my menery is so 
bad.

THE SONG OF THE FLAGS. 
As sung by TONY PASTOR, at the Opera House. 
And by JENNIE HUGHES, at the Metropolitan Theatre. 
THERE'S a 
nation of brave people held in bond against their 
will. 
But to them will come a 
day of liberty, 
When to the world they can proclaim their little Emerald 
Isle, 
As added to the nations of the free, 
Our sympathies are with them for Americans believe, 
That the laws of God and man, have been profaned, 
When the governed have to suffer and are held in cruel bonds, 
By laws against their interest maintained. 
(Irish gag.) 
Then here's the flag of Ireland, a 
flag of liberty, 
All friends of Erin now do drink a 
ruby toast to thee. 
There's a 
nation of brave people from the storied river Rhine, 
Whose emigrants are welcome to our land, 
They are law-abiding citizens, the very last in war, 
And in peace the first to give a 
riendly hand, 
Of Europe's civilization they are the greatest nation, 
I 
hope a 
Republic they'll soon be, 
For they're people that we love, and will like to see them free.. 
As those in this great land of liberty. 
(German Fihg.) 
Then here's the flag of Germany, floating proudly free, 
May "Die Wacht am Rhein," be one day sung, in the Halls of 
Liberty. 
26 
Thrre's a 
band of noble patriots by Spanish tyrants ruled, 
Who are fighting to gain their liberty, soon with victory they'll 
be crowned, 
For they've many honest friends in America, the home of the 
free, 
Our flag has been insulted, and we'll show these Spanish dons, 
That the time has now arrived we're not afraid, 
The Virginius and her crew we'll speedily avenge, 
And to poor suffering Cuba lend our aid, 
(Cuban Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of Cuba, so very dear you are, 
May soon in freedom proudly float, the flag of a 
single star, 
There's a 
country of brave people, 
Who stand head upon the list, 
Of any throughout this mighty world, 
She's a 
refuge for the oppressed, 
From every other land, 
And for freedom her banner is unfurled, 
Our centennial anniversary, we shortly hope to write, 
Upon the immortal scroll of fame, 
In memory of the blessings bequeathed by Washington, 
Then forever revered be his name. 
(American Flag.) 
Then here's the flag of America, the flag of Washington. 
The greatest flag throughout the world, that e'er the sun shown 
As sung by TONY PASTOR. 
THEY. talk about their foreign girls, 
how beautiful they are, 
And how they dress, and all that thing, 
But for that I 
don't care ; 
The girls I 
love are Yankee girls ; 
I 
see them every day ; 
They're plain, I 
own, but then they have 
A 
nice and winning way. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, indeed. 
I 
needn't go out of the United States 
to find— 
cnoRts. 
Beautiful girls, beautiful girls, 
Saucy, teazing pleasing girls ; 
I 
love one and all, both great and small, 
Beautiful, beautiful girls. 
It's nice, when its winter time, 
To go upon the road 
In a 
nice sleigh, a 
pretty girl 
'Long side of you is stowed; 
And how the people they will look, 
And wonder who she is ; 
But you drive on, and never mind, 
Because it's not their ‘• biz." 
SPOKEN.—It's the cicest thing in winter to have a 
pretty girl 
out sleighing. 
You stop at a 
hotel, and ask her what she will 
have to drink. 
She says (very meekly), " Wine." " What 
kind— port or sherry ?" 
She says, " Champagne." Now, im-
agine treating to champagne and only a 
dollar in your pocket— 
and that always happens when you take out riding_ 
Beautiful girls, etc. 
And when the summer comes around, 
To pic-nics you do go, 
And to enjoy yourself, while there, 
You ask along your beau. 
The day is fine, the music, too, 
And birds sing from each tree, 
And with a 
charming, nice young girl, 
how happy one must be! 
SPOKEN.—At a 
pic-nic a 
man can always enjoy himself, it he 
has a 
pretty girl with him. 
How nice. it is to eat lunch with 
her that she has prepared with her delicate hands! How nice 
it is to get into a 
swing with her, and then to wander off in the 
woods alone! 
You get on your knees, and tell her you will 
love her as long as life lasts, and ask her to be your wife. 
She 
consents. 
You then get up, and find a 
lot of mud and oyster-
shells all over your knees ; and all that comes from making 
love W----

SPOKEN:—You see before I 
got married, every thing was 
just as dull as it could be; ane now Vais season there's no end 
to the parties, &c. 
Every n..ght the girls come in my room, 
and say: Well, aint you going to the ball ? And I 
say just as 
sweet as can be, Hubby dear, shall we go ? And he answers back 
as cross as a 
bear, no indeed we shant go, we'll stay at home 
these hard times. 
Then all the girls come home the next 
morning, and tell how many sweet-hearts, how many dances, 
how many ice creams, haw many boiled oysters, and all that 
2 
The other night in the dollar store, 
I 
met a 
gent so fair, 
Oh hazel were his beaming eyes, 
And golden was his hair. 
He looked at me a 
little while, 
I 
him in silence eyed, 
And soon we both were talking love, 
While walking side by side. 
SPOKEN:—He 
said, you'll allow me to present you with 
this beautiful china doll for a 
dollar ?-0h no, thank you sir, 
I've got through playing with dolls. 
Then we t
ook 
a 
li
ttle 
walk up Broadway; we looks in all the store windows, saw 
the pictures, stopped at the jewelry stores to see the pretty 
things. Holiday presents, and all that sort of things. 
He 
said these are very nice articles. 
I 
answered yes, real nice 
presents; I 
said PRESENTS for a 
young lady, half a 
dozen 
times, and he never once took the hint. 
Then he said let's 
go to the theatre. 
To the theatre ? I 
couldn't, because you 
see my husband is there, though I 
assure you.—Morus.

But now I 
must conclude my song, 
And toddle off with speed, 
Or otherwise I 
feel convinced, 
There'll be a 
row indeed. 
For Charles Augustus, my dear hub, 
Is waiting close at hand, 
And rows with him I 
do declare, 
Are more than I 
can stand. 
SPOKEN:—I'm really sorry to bid you good evening, but 
my husband ( Mr. Rickey is heard calling at the rear of the 
stage: Mrs. Hughes, will you come down stairs and get me 
my supp. r. and the ould man has come home, and wants 
warm water for shaving. 
Come off quick, for the child has 
fell in the fire.) Ladies and gentlemen, I 
hope you wont ask 
me to sing any more, as my husband is so awfully jealous, 
even if he is Irish, ( Mr. Rielicy) Who's Irish? will cut that 
short, with your " I 
should ; ike to." 
Well, as far as I 
am 
pPxsonally concerned you know you all know.—Ur,

THE G. P. O. 
Sung by JENNIE linonEe. 
St: Martins le Grand as you all well know, 
is the building that's known as the G. P. 0. 
Where billet-doux, Valentines, and Tailor's bills too 
Before they ever reach us must pass through ; 
It. party was employed there whose sorrowful tale, 
Would touch a 
heart of flint, through a 
douple coat of mail, 
ais surname it was Johnson, his other name was Joe, 
A.nd he was a 
letter sorter in the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
And he was a 
letter sorter in the G. P. 0. 
gow Joe became spooney on a 
good-looking lass, 
Whose father was a 
dealer in crockery and glass, 
He often thought of marriage, though his screw was love, 
He received " one pound per week" at the G. 1'. 0!) 
But her parent was ambitious, and nearly drop'd 
With horror when poor Joe, " the awful question" pop'd, 
What! think I'll give my Che-ild to one so low, 
I 
mean her for a 
Big Gun in the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
You're but a 
letter sorter with the common name of Joe 
32 
erom that cruel old Coger, poor Joe then rushed, 
His plans sent to smithereens, his hopes all crushed, 
At his " official duties" no longer was he gay, 
He was " going to the dogs " the fellows would say; 
He was always making blunders, always doing wrong, 
The letters meant for Manchester, he sent to Boulogne, 
What should have gone to Charing Cross, turned up at Jerichc 
So they had to kick him out of the G. P. 0. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
The office in the City where the letters all go, 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
No more a 
letter sorter was the young man Joe. 
The girl who'd been the cause of his sorrows and his ills, 
Was poisoned with a 
box of Kamptulicon Pills, 
Her father became bankrupt, and wild with his losses, 
Sent a 
sixpence to " the Claimant," then took to backhu 
horses; 
My melancholy story is drawing to a 
close, 
Joe meditated suicide to finish up his woes, 
He went and paid his Income Tax, and then did go, 
And cut his elbow with a 
post card near the G. P. U. 
CHORUS. 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. O. 
The office in the City where the letters all " 
The G. P. 0. the G. P. 0. 
And that was the finale of the young man Joe. 
MY WHISK-AWS. 
As 
sung by JENNIE H UGH ES. 
I'M a 
languid Swell, as you may perceive, 
The hearts of the fair ones I 
break ; 
My vows of affection and love they believe, 
As I 
swear I'll be true for their sake; 
And oh ! how they dote on my tigaw divine, 
As gaily I 
waltz and I 
frisk— haw, haw, 
And quickly, ( if asked,) they'd agrec to be mine' 
For who could withstand such a 
whisk-awl 
CHORUS . 
The lovely whisk-aws that deck my face 
And to my appearance add infinite grace. 
I 
hear it said as I 
pass each place, 
By Jove! what lovely whisk-aws. 
At the sea-side once I 
met a 
fair, 
Whose form divine I'll ne'er forget, 
Her teeth were pearls, her waving hair 
In color might vie with deepest jet; 
To a 
ball one night I 
chanced to go. 
And as near I 
beheld her frisk, aw, haw 
Her fan, as waltzing, she whirled to alio Ire 
Once gently brushed my whisk-aws. 
The lovely whisk-aws, 
c. 
Her name and position I 
soon fully learn'd, 
And a 
friend's introduction I 
quickly obtained, 
33 
Whenever we met great attention I 
paid, 
And concluded her heart I 
had certainly gained; 
So the question I 
popped, swore to win her I'd die, 
And implored her to answer me brisk haw ! 
But judge my dismay, when I 
heard her reply— 
On condition you shave off your whisk-aw. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, by Jove! I 
addressed her as follows : Dear 
kraminta, ask me to bring you a 
wrinkle from the brow ot 
the silver wings of a 
butterfly from the Arctic regions, tip-
eaws of the powny Jerusalem, the beard of Prophet 
itahommed from the sacred shrine at Mecca— these individuau5 
lnit collectively will I 
do to prove my adoration, but by Jovs. 
voiq know don't ask a 
fella ii to sacrifice 
The lovely whisk-aws 
She replied with a 
glance of infinite scorn, 
That the sooner my visit was ended 
'Twould be better for both, as ' twas evident, quite 
Our feelings could never be blended: 
And her happiness she was unwilling to stake. 
And future existence to risk, aw, haw! 
With one who refused to part for her sake, 
With a 
trifle so slight as his whisk-aw. 
The lovely whisk-aws, 
Moonlight, Starlight, Daylight, 
Sung by JENNIE Hutiur,s. 
WHILE going thro' this brilliant world, 
So many lights we see, 
There's moonlight and there's starlight, 
And daylight makes the three ; 
They are the three great lights, we're told, 
At least we'll let them be ; 
For daylight is a 
jolly time, 
And moonlight shines so free. 
CHORUS. 
Moonlight, starlight, daylight or other lights, 
Rushlight, sunlight no matter what they be. 
Gaslight, nightlight. candlelight or limelight, 
Skylight, lamplight, are pleasant unto me. 
First moonlight shines so brightly, 
The stars they glitter so ; 
The daylight shows us daily, 
Wherever we do go : 
The gaslight burns so gaily 
While the rushlight's glimmer glow : 
The best and dearest of all things. 
One day I 
purposed that I'd go, 
The Palace for to see : 
The sun was shining bright that day: 
The birds sung out their glee, 
The day it pass'd, the evening came, 
While sitting down to tea, 
A 
bird came whistling in my ear, 
And singing merrily. 
Moonlight, starlight, &C. 
It shines on man and woman, 
It shines on cattle too: 
But most I 
hope sincerely, 
It shines on all of you: 
It shines on houses, and on lands, 
The waters meet it's view : 
how pleasant of a 
sunny day, 
When the sky it looks so blue. 
Moonlight, starlight, 
As sung by JENNIE H UGHES. 
I 
HAD to make a 
journey a 
little while ago, 
Somewhere down the Jersey Central, you must know • 
A 
splendid-looking man, he was seated hy my side, 
He asked me if I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
The man he was troubled with absence of mind, 
The ticket for his journey he had left it far behind, 
• 
He could not recollect the town to which he wished to ride, 
So begged that I 
would lend to him my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, he had actually forgotten the name of the 
town that he wished to travel to, 
Could only remember that 
the word contained the letter B, M or K. 
So I 
began to run 
through a 
list of towns whose name contained thrt.t letter, such 
as: 
Cnoitus. 
Manyunk and Mauchchunck, Neversink and Squedunk, 
There's Peekskill and Fishkill and Catskill beside, 
Weehawken and Hoboken, Binghamptoa and St.onington, 
Ile said he'd sure to find it in my Railway Guide, 
Then I 
produced my Appleton, and said to him " Good man. 
Take the book I'm reading, and find it if you can ;" 
He took the volume from my hand and eagerly he tried; 
To find the place he wanted in my Railway Guide, 
He searched o'er every leaf, and turned o'er every p 
age, 
until at last the fellow 
got in quite a 
rage, 
38 
Je soon turned round to me, and bitterly he cried: 
Dear Miss! I 
cannot find it in your Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN.—Although he slid he had read all through, 
Manyunk and Mauchchunk, 
I 
reached my destination and was going to alight. 
He placed his hand upon my arm, and said with much affright, 
Oh, dear miss ! don't leave me, all alone to ride, 
What shall I 
do without you, and your Railway Guide. 
!Said I: Oh no, I'm going down now to my hotel, 
You, sir, cannot walk with me, for it would not look well: 
But he linked his arm in mine, and kept marching by my side, 
lie kept a 
firm grasp on me and my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN : And, said he, if we put our heads together, we 
shall certainly soon discover, whether it is 
Manyunk and Mauchehunk, ct,c. 
He walked with me in silence, some distance on the road, 
I 
knew not how to leave him, when I 
got to my abode; 
And all that afternoon, the foolish fellow tried, 
To pay attention to me, and my Railway Guide; 
And once he plucked up courage, and squeezed my little glove, 
He suddenly discovered that he was deep in love; 
He proposed and I 
accepted, I'm soon to be his bride, 
And thus I'll gain a 
husband with my Railway Guide. 
SPOKEN: 
And he tells me it makes him feel so happy, that 
be dent care if he neve: arrives either at 
Maynunk and Mauchchunk, (

It's Naughty But It's Nice. 
As sung by Nis. Jennie Hughes. 
There's lots of things you know, 
Wherever you may go, 
That we should never undertake to do, 
Although it charms the eye, 
We ought to pass it by, 
It would be better if we only knew. 
My Mother used to say, unto me every day, 
When you see a 
pie don't always want a 
slice, 
I 
used to go up stairs and take it unawares, 
AU 0-
14 while I 
knew ' twas naughty but ' twas nice. 
CHORUS. 
Chlit's naughty but it's nice, and we like it so, 
'Tis sure fellows do wrong to entice, 
No matter what you see, you never can agree, 
All * be while you know its naughty but it's nice, you bet I 
We go to see our girls, with lots of pretty curls, 
To pass the time so pleasantly away, 
We praise the little dears, and drive away their fears. 
And such lots of sweet nonsence to them say. 
And when it's late at night, 
The stars are shining bright, 
To kiss them, why it gives to life a 
spie,e, 
Our arms around their wais ts, delightfully are placed 
All the while we know it's naughty but it's nice.

As sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
THERE was a 
naughty little boy, as naughty as could be, 
Who used to scream, and vex his Ma, and spill his daily tea ; 
His leisure moments he'd employ regardless of her cries, 
In sticking pins and needles in his little sister's eyes ; 
He often used to lose himself, and gave his parents pain,— 
By turning up his little nose, when he tarried up again ; 
He kicked his mother's poodle and then out of window threw 
him, 
And bit his little brother so, that people hardly knew him 
He used to smash his pretty toys, his Noah's Ark likewise, 
Where Elephants and Beetles were exactly of a 
size ; 
lie amputated Japhet's arms, and cut of Noah's feet, 
Persisting as he swallow'd him— that ham was good, to eat 
He never once repented, though his gentle parents frown'd, 
But took a 
holiday from 
school, to see the kittens drown'd ; 
In hiding Fido's meat he seem'd to take an honest pride, 
And teased the cat so much, that she committed suicide. 
He never shed a 
single tear o'er Pussy's mournful fate, 
But called his nurse a 
naughty name, and went to bed at eight; 
He put the candle out, and with the last expiring spark, 
He thought he saw two eyes that glared and glistened in the 
dark; 
He thought, he saw a 
mewing, and he thought he heard a 
head, 
'41 
That would have been like Pussy's only she was cold and dew... 
Tho' dreadful eyes drew nearer—oh, most terrible of sights--
He screamed aloud—the cat! the cat! and then they brought 
the lights. 
They look'd about all in and out, but nothing could they see, 
That threw a 
light upon the cause of this catastrophee; 
Until the morning came, when nurse with dreadful horror saw, 
Each nail had grown a 
talon, and each little hand a 
paw ; 
He took to catching mice, and even rats he'd not refuse, 
Was seized with cataleptic tits, and hungabout the mews, 
And thinking he had got nine lives, he played at Pool all day, 
And joined the hippo-phalogical society, they say. 
He took to hating pastry, and he grew quite sick o' tart, 
Sat musing at the wiudow, till he heard the cat's- meat cart; 
his parents tried to win him back, with coaxes and with smiles, 
But he wouldn't own a 
feather bed's superior to tiles; 
I 
don't know what became of him, 
and what's more do not 
care, 
For naughty little boys like that, I 
never could a-bear,— 
Be kind to cats and kittens is the moral I 
would tell, 
And send a 
friend to see ' em drowned, and that'll do as well.

MEDLEY. 
As sung by Miss Jenney Hughes 
Wnen the corn is waving, Annie dear,

And tired now, and sleepy too,— 
So put me in my little bed. 
Come, sister come, kiss me good night, 
For I

flower. 
That nods and bends in the breezes, 
And my heart is as light as the 
wind that blows, 
Over the sea, over the sea, 
hear what a 
little bird whispers to me, 
Oh I 
Come back to Erin, Mavourneen I 
Mavourneen! Come back Aroon, 
to the land of thy birth, 
And riding in a 
sleigh boy's 
Passing all the style, 
Talking to a

how the bells are jinglin, 
As so merrily we fly 
Behind our two forty nag, 
Oh! how is that for high. 
Tyrolean Ducks. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hugh. 
Whenever ducks go two by two, 
They're surely got something in view, 
And what it is they will not tell, 
Although themselves they know it well, 
They smoothe the feathers on their back, 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack, quack. 
Onus. 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack, 
Tra oh In uh, Tra la, train, uh, au 
Quack, quack, quack. 
Whenever ducks go three by three, 
It puzzles much both you and me, 
Are there two drakes and but one duck, 
Or but a 
single drake in luck. 
They smoothe the feathers on his back. 
With a 
loving quack, quack, quack,quack. 
CHORUS. 
Quack, quack, quack, quack, 
And little ducks words never lack, 
Tra oh la uh, tra In, tra In uh, ah, 
Quack, quack, quack. 
Don't Ask Me To Give Up Joe! 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
I've got a 
dashing beau called Joseph, 
Such a 
charming beau is Joe; 
He has asked my hand in Marriage, 
But my Pa and Ma say no; 
You can never wed our daughter, 
Give him up; but I

Ask any thing in this wide world, 
But don't ask me to give up Joe!

Or Dutchmen to leave their lager beer,

Once He was a 
gay young Clerk. 
As sung by _Miss Jennie Hughes. 
I'm the girl that's always laughing, 
I'm so very merry all the day, 
Nothing can annoy or fret me, 
I'm as happy as the flowers of May, 
Some are crying, some are sighing 
I'm so jolly and peru ips you'd like to know the reason, 
Can't you guess it, Fil confess it, 
I'm in love with such a 
nice young man. 
CHORUS. 
Once he was a 
gay young clerk, 
In a 
Broadway dry goods store, 
But now he's joined the city militia, 
And I 
love him all the more. 
My love he is a 
high private, 
That is nothing very great you say, 
But he's learnt how to salute me, 
And embrace me in a 
military way, 
When parading and arrayed in 
A grey coat without a 
single dollar in his pocket 
Could you but see him you would love him_ 
For he's really such a 
nice youn, mar.,

THE KILKENNY BOY. 
As sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
I 
WENT to school to Darby Toole, who'd been a 
soldier I've 
been told. 
His talk of wars and drums; and scars came over me when 
nine years old; 
Then I took to drums instead of sums, shillelah being my 
writing pen, 
My only books being outside crooks, my only joy being 
fighting men. 
Disdaining brogues, I 
crossed the bogs, with heart as light 
as any boy, 
The girls would cry when me they'd spy, " Sure there's Larry 
Moore the Irish Boy !" 
cnonus, 
Oh ! the nice, the,neat, t 
e 
tall, complete, 
The handsome, fine Kdkenny boy. 
When older gr mil, the girls—och hone !— about their hearts 
they tw isted me, 
T.I1 Sergeant Shay, he came one day, and with a 
shilling he 
listed me ; 
Then Kitty Burn she left her churn, saying, "Och ! youve 
been deceiving me." 
And Kate O'Neil—faith I'll go bail—will break her heart for 
leaving me. 
So, in this plight, a 
soldier tight, I 
marched as flue as any boy 
The fair to melt, the to pelt, none equalled the Kilkenny boy. 
Oh ! the nice, the neat, Sze. 
But Sergeant Shay he died one day, a 
bullet laid him on the 
floor, 
That same polthlgue that stopped his brogue a 
sergeant made 
of Larry Moore ; 
And when the peace bid fighting cease, of girls—och hone— 
I 
had a 
few 
Who tried to tease, but none could please like the charming 
widow Donoghue. 
It is herself that has the pelf, it is myself can spend it with 
joy, 
She cried "Och hone! you're all my own, my darling, lave 
Kilkenny boy." 
Oh ! the nice, the neat, ..tc. 
As sung by JENNIE HUGHES. 
THIS world's a 
cold and selfish one, 
As many tnousands know; 
Who once were blessed with hope and joy, 
But DOW are fallen low. 
Whose hearts were ever kind and warm, 
Nor turned from grief aside; 
But always lent a 
listening ear, 
When pain and sorrow sighed. 
Then let us aid their sad distress, 
For we like them perchance, 
May crave the favor of the world, 
To give us another chance. 
We cannot search their breaking hearts, 
To know the anguish there, 
But kindly acts may heal their smart. 
And soothe their sad despair, 
For many whom you meet to-day. 
In sorrow broken down 
Possesses hearts as kind and true, 
And noble as thine own. 
Then do not turn away from them, 
With cold and haughty glance, 
But lift your fallen brother up, 
And give him another chance. 
The riches of the world were made, 
Not for a 
selfish end; 
But that we generously might spare, 
Some, for a 
suffering friend, 
No matter what the faults may he. 
Concealed within his heart, 
To save the wretched erring one, 
Is a 
true and manly part: 
Then, when you see a 
fallen man, 
With sorrow in his glance, 
Don't crush him farther in the dust, 
But give him another chance. 
As Sung by JENNY Timms. 
DID you iver see Meg, dashing Galway Meg, 
The wickedest witch in OuId Erin, 
Who has eyes like a 
sloe, and a 
bosom of snow, 
That the boys are all toasting and cheerin,c, 
Such cheeks, och the roses and the lips (Father Moses), 
To taste them would make you quite tipsy, 
Thin whiniver you're dead or with spirits of lead, 
Take a 
smack from the mouth of this gipsy. 
Ig can clear a 
stone wall with a 
mettlesome nag, 
Leap a 
ditch with the best in the chase, 
Sound the whoop tally ho ! to the hounds on the go, 
And come out the first man in the race, 
Such an air and such hair when she springs don't you 
stare, 
But be aisey and plaise not get friskey, 
For a 
squint at her foot, and her ancle to boot, 
Would warm you all over like whiskey. 
She can dance, she can sing, in the ould Irish way, 
Take a 
noggin, and swing a 
Shille!ah, 
She's the belle of the fair when the girls are all there, 
And the queen of the court where she may be. 
Such a 
neck ! such a 
waist (Och hould me, make haste,) 
To clasp them would make you onaisey, 
Your courage is gone, and you're conquered, 0

By Meg, Galway Meg, the swate daisy. 
As sung by JENNIE 'REGIMES. 
I 
AM tormented night and day, 
The fact I 
cannot smother, 
By my intended husband, 
And also my big brother ; 
They're always teazing me, they are, 
I've not one moment's quiet, 
From morn till night, ' tis their delight 
In the house to cause a 
riot. 
SPOKEN : I 
used to think my brother a 
harem scarem, but 
I 
assure you my sweetheart, Lionel, is a 
perfect limb, always 
playing tricks upon us, but notwithstanding his faults— 
CHORE. 
Ohl He loves me and I 
love him, 
We both love one another, 
lie's such a 
dreadful teaze, he is, 
lie's worse than my big brother. 
My brothers led my sweetheart 
To bitter beer and smoking ; 
They don't indulge too much, 
But then ' tis really so provoking. 
In the drawing room or sitting room, 
The fumes are wafted freely, 
The smoke in fumes does arise 
And always chokes me nearly. 
SPOKEN: No matter how [ lecture them about smoking i. 
the drawing-room, they won't desist. 
Then Lionel says to me, 
".Now my darling wife, that is to be, you wouldn't debar your 
husband that will be, of one of his greatest enjoyments, would 
you? 
Well, there, I'll 
put out the pipe to oblige you? 
Directly I 
leave the room, there they are puffing clouds out 
again, but 
Oh! He loves me, &c. 
Now my brother climbs the house-top 
And down the chimney cries, 
When we're talking of the future, 
And arranging nuptial ties. 
Then Lionel my intended 
Makes all sorts of false alarms, 
By saying the wardrobe is on lire, 
And swoons in the servant's arms. 
SPOKEN : Well, I'll let him have his own way while he's 
single, but I 
believe he'll be just as bad when married. 
Well, 
I 
don't care if he is. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes. 
I'm a 
stupid bashful girl, 
how I 
titty-ti,ti-tremble, 
Seeing just to hear me sing, 
Such a 
multitude assemble, 
Oh, pray don't, or I 
won't, 
Sing a 
note if anybody look at me., 
How I 
quake, how I 
shake, 
Verily timidity's a 
dreadful thing 
Gentlemen I 
chance to meet, 
Make me niny-ni.ni- nervous, 
And I 
never walk the street, 
Without saying heaven preserve us 
How they stare, I 
declare 
T 
get red as any peony, 
Look so meek that they speak, 
Oh, George ! isn't she a 
very, very Bashful Girl. 
Won' t 
some gentleman be my friend, 
Like a 
bibby-bi-bi-bi-brother, 
Telling me my fault's to mend, 
And this silly shyness smother, 
If I 
can find a 
man, 
Who belives in love that is platonieal, 
I 
might get courage yet, 
Really I'm a 
very, very, bashful Girl. 
As sung by Miss Jennie Hughes, 
l' ye a 
fellah who does'nt like bothah, 
All trouble to him is a 
bore, 
lie's an income left him by his mothaw, 
What on earth could a 
fdlah want more; 
His favorite sport's killing time, 
His aim's to do nothing at all, 
While some in this world run and climb, 
He takes the trip easy and crawls. 
For they tell him he's awfully clevah; 
Oh, so clevah, deuced cicvab, 
They say that they nevah, no nevah, 
Met a 
fellah, so clevah before. 
Some fellahs go in for the Army? 
And some fellahs go in for trade, 
But he hasn't such bores to alarm him, 
his fortune was already made. 
And some fellahs go in for brain, 
And scribble to earn an honest penny, 
Those fellahs deserve all their gains, 
is for brains he could do without any. 
in the park he is often seen driving, 
lie thinks he's Alexis, the duke, 
Whenever he goes in for billiards, 
lie thinks he's a 
hard, one to fluke. 
Some times at an evening party, 
To keep us alive in he'll peep, 
Whenever we ask. him to sing, 
W. are certain to fQII fast asleep,

Underneath the sweet magnolia, now, remember what I "tole yer,” 
That's the place I 
met Miss Kitty Allalee, 
Where the sweet magnolia blossom. shed its petals on her bosom. 
And I 
had to brush them off so tenderly. 
But she seemed to half decline when I 
asked her to be mine; 
Then I 
pressed her closer to my loving breast. 
Till she said you may relent it, hasty weddings are repented, 
That was all he said, but you can guess the rest. 
Cuo.-Oh, Yes! Sce. 
PICCADILLY. 
Sung by M ISS JKNNIE ENGEI„ 
SOME fella's think the Zoo's the spot 
For the " creme de la creme " 
And crawl into the monkey house, 
To hear their brothers scream! 
While some declare that Belgrave Square's 
The Eden ot the West, 
To meet with swells and dashing belles 
But by Jove, I 
know the best 
SPOKEN.—The locality I 
refer to is. 
Cnoitus. 
Piccadilly, Piccadilly! 
For elegant swells and the fairest of belles, 
Piccadilly, Piccadilly, 
That's where I 
reside when in town. 
Sometimes I 
do a 
gentle crawl, 
By Jove, I've gone that far, 
That I 
have nearly knocked against 
That horrid Temple Bar; 
At once I've hail'd a 
Hansom 
" 
Haw, cabby, heaw, come heaw, 
Oh! drive me home directly or 
By Jove, I 
shall be queer." 
Sum:Ex.—Where to! confound the fella, why of course 
Piccadilly, &c. 
Sometimes into the Burlington 
Arcade a 
fellow drops, 
Because a 
fella cannot bear 
The common sort of shin, 
The doosed beadle knows me there 
As he walks up and down, 
He'll call me captain, touch his hat 
And that costs half a 
crown. 
SroKEN.--Of course a 
fella must spend half-a-crown 
now and then especially if he resides in 
Piccadilly, &c. 
One meets in Piccadilly, folks 
Who are well known at court, 
No retired tallow chandlers then_ 
No vulgar trading sort 
A legacy enables me 
To mix with the elite 
And many a 
fair charmer there 
I'm fortunate to meet. 
SPOKEN.—Among my aristocratic acquaintances I 
num-
ber the Honorable Priscilla Pimple, Lady Dudley Dood-
lem, the Duchess of Cowcrosshire, and many other first-
class people, and they all reside in 
Piccadilly, &c. 
But this butterfly existence now 
With me will soon be past, 
For Hymen soon will hind me 
In his rosy fetters fast; 
I 
shall shortly pop the question, 
To the child of an M. P. 
I'm sure to be accepted, so 
It's all U. P. with me. 
MPOKEN.—But I 
suppose a 
fella oughn't to grumble at 
the present of a 
fair creature and a " plum" a 
year. Proper 
weddings are generally done at Hanover Square, but I 
mean to patronize the little church in

O'ER THE HILLS AND DALES SO GRAND. 
Written by E. 
DAVIES, expressly for JENNIE H IIGLIES. 
I 
CAME from dear Old Ireland, with very little money, 
I 
crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see, 
I've heard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate, the wonders which I've seen. 
Of the hills and dales so grand, that's seen in Paddy's land, 
The boys and girls of our dear Isie, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's a 
pretty place called Dublin, 
What can equal that great city, 
For learning and for excellence oi Erin's gallant sons, 
To the memory of departed worth, I'll spake of Dan 
O'Connell. 
Emmett, Moore and Grattan tor the services these have 
done. 
There's the " Dargle " and the " Devil's Glen," in the County 
Wicklow, 
The sweet Lakes of Killarney, in Kerry County too, 
Not forgetting " Blarney Castle," you all know what I 
mean 
now, 
For there of course the boys all go, to kiss the Blarney stone.

method of playing is somewhat complicated, but tl e 
directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing.

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
sn meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a 
want of means of 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-committal. 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too difft. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense a 
propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of crasstions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

It to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
ef it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when oast 
cohere to do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the Ili-
Corrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting."

book, bound in Morocco leather, costing -cwenty-ftve cents, called the 
"Little Flirt," published by A. J. Fisnxii, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the modua operandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might al 
lord some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to neon-
Mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
