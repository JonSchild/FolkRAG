THE IRISH CORNET. 
Written and sung with great success by the eminent Character 
- 
Vocalist, D AVID RocuE, through all the principal cities of the 
United States and Canada. 
I 
Am a 
musician of very great fame, 
A 
wonderful artist, I 
am Michael McShane; 
My equal, believe me, was never seen yet 
For lilting and warbling on the Irish cornet. 
When I 
put in appearance they all give me room, 
Either Gilmore or Offenbach can't catch the tune, 
The great variations they are sure to forget, 
When played by the master on the Irish cornet. 
SPoKEx. (
L.There's millions in it-! 
No later than yes-
terday I 
got an offer to be an honorable member of a 
brass band ; what did I 
do ? I 
did what a 
great many 
here wouldn't do. 
I 
scorned it ! 
I 
laid my instrument 
down when my dignity arose. No, sir 1 
sooner than be 
a 
collector for an organization of that sort, I 
would wan-
der through lanes and alleys, take chances of what little 
I 
might receive—buckets or bouquets, bricks or pennies ! 
Now, then, present your instrument, Michael. (
big.) 
Wonders and miracles I 
do understand, 
Since I 
had the good luck to shake the Dutch Band ; 
I 
am hired to play- at a 
very large sum, 
To lead the musicians, while beating the drum ; 
I 
won at a 
party a 
cake with a 
string, 
At a 
wake made a 
corpse dance a 
Scotch Highland fling, 
Got John Kelly Tammany to make a 
great bet 
That the instrument used was an Irish cornet. 
SPOKEN.---Yes ! there was a 
great dispute concerning 
the glorious instrument between Theodore Tilton and 
Chief Kelly, who said it was originally an Irish instru-
ment used by Brian Borue ; Theodore would have it, it 
was an ancient instrument called a " Mongolian flutanna-
tint° ;" Kelly would have scalped him, when I 
struck up 
a 
lively air that went something like this : 
(Playing a 
lively air on tin whistle.)

THE CHARCOAL MAR. 
composed by W ELLING, and. Sung with great success by ItnanT °gooBan. 
My name ' tis Danny Connor, I 
am a 
charcoal man, 
And if you will but listen you'll see I 
am an Irishman ; 
I 
was born in Dublin City, that place of great renown, 
But now I 
am here in America, peddling charcoal through the 
town. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, as I 
was walking down the main street I 
met 
one Paddy O'Hare and Paddy Flaherty. " Good morning, Din-
Me," says they. " Good morning, boys," says I. " Where are 
you going V says they. " Gorra, don't you see 1" says I. " I 
am making great preparations for the land of America. 
Will 
you come 7" says I. 
So with that we all started for the great 
city called Latherpole, but when I 
got there I 
found I 
had only 
money enough to pay two of their passages. " What will 
we do now l" says one or them, flaring up. " Wait awhile," 
says I, " till I 
subtract." 
So I 
began. 
Paddy from Paddy I 
couldn't, for that would lave one behind. I 
paid both of their 
passages anyway, and I 
went into a 
barrel myself, and they put 
me down in the hole of the ship, and when the ship began to 
go the barrel began to roll inside of the ship, and I 
began to 
roar inside of the barrel, and for three long weeks I 
was crying 
out—" Oh, Paddies, there is the devil's own roar inside of me." 
CHORUS. 
Charcoal is my cry; I 
make the old horse get, 
And if he does go slow, you bet I'll use the whip. 
I 
fell in love with a 
nice young girl, her name was Rosie Ann, 
he said I 
was a 
genius, and she would have no other man; 
(1) 
THE CHARCOAL MAN.—Continued. 
But now she is gone and left me for a 
fellow by the name of 
McGee, 
Who peddles sawdust round the corner, and my Rosie no more 
I 
see. 
SPOKEN.—When I 
landed here I 
was sent to a boarding 
house, and be_.-
Y,orra they put me in bed with a 
nigger, and when 
they woke me up in the morning, I 
looked at myself in the 
glass, and what do you think, but me face was black. 
I 
sup-
pose some of theta were after blacking it. 
Anyhow, I 
know 
that I 
went to the landlord, and tould. him that they woke up 
the wrong man, for I 
am in bed yet. 
Charcoal is my cry, etc. 
One day they were out a-riding, and the horse he took a 
fright, 
He ran away with Rosie, and didn't sthop till night, 
They ran away up to Harlem Bridge, Rosie screamed with all 
her might ; 
lie upset the charcoal wagon and kicked poor Rosie out of 
sight. 
SPOKEN.—I 
wint down one day to the market, and there I 
saw the funniest kind of fish I 
ever saw. " What kind of fish 
do you call that, sar ?" says I. " Lobster, sar," says he ; " put 
your finger in there," meaning the claw of the lobster. " I 
wont, sar," says I; " but I 
have a 
dog here, and I'll put his tail 
in." 
So I 
put the dog's tail in the claw of the lobster, and the 
dog ran away with the lobster. " Say, young man," says he, 
" 
fishle back your dog." " I 
wont, sar," says I, " but do you 
fisble back your lobster." 
Charcoal is my cry, etc.

OVLII HER KNEE. 
COpyright, 1875, by LEE & WALKEn, Phila., Pa. 
Price 30 cents. 
Sang by MYLES MORELS, at Tony Pastor's Opera House, X. Y. 
OVER her knee, over her knee 
flow my old Grandmother used to spank me, 
Over her knee, over her knee, 
When I 
was quite a 
small boy ! 
It was spank I 
spank ! spank I 
No use was it kicking, for on she went licking. 
With spank ! spank ! spank 
The thing she quite used to enjoy. 
Then it's over her knee, over her knee ; 
How my old Grandmother used to spank me, 
Over her knee, over her knee,. 
When I 
was quite a 
small boy. 
Over her knee, over her knee, 
Oft she would turn me, as if for a 
spree, 
Over her knee, over her knee, 
Turn me again and again ; 
It was spank 
spank I 
spank 
In vain was my crying, she kept applying 
The spank ! spank ! spank ! 
0, it was, a 
terrible pain. 
Then it's over her knee, ete. 
When I 
was free—down from her knee. 
Naughty again I 
was certain to be. 
Then she took me back on her knee, 
Acting the same as before; 
It was spank ! spank 
spank ! 
A 
wretched young fellow, 0, bow I 
did bellow, 
Still spank I 
spank I 
spank ! 
.0h, yes, 'twas no end of a 
bore! 
Then it's over her knee, etc. 
MY PRETTY IRISH QUE=.-1. 
Sung by LEoNAlln arid joEES. 
How happy is the evening 
When the moon o'er the lull- tops peep, 
And the dew is softly falling 
To lull the flowers to sleep. 
It is then mem'ry's stealing 
Back to a 
happy scene ; 
Of one I 
never will forget, 
Is my pretty little Irish queen. 
CHORUS. 
Oh I 
my pretty little Irish queen, 
Whoever happy seems ; 
With golden hair and eyes so fair, 
This pretty little Irish queen. 
Oh! my pretty little Irish queen, 
The fairest ever seen ; 
It was hard to part 
From the darling of my heart, 
My pretty little Irish queen. 
• 
Her eyes are like the dew-drops 
That glitter on the rose so bright ; 
And teeth just like the lilies, 
Which bloom so fair and. white. 
When the shades of night have fallen 
Her face then haunts my dream ; 
But there's a 
day when I'll return 
And claim my Irish queen. 
Ohl luy pretty, etc. 
TM', FLOWER OF MACK MRALLY, OH! 
A CHARACTERISTIC IRISH BALLAD. 
'TwAs one fine summer's morning, 
When flowers they were a-blooming; oh ! 
Meadows were adornin7, and small 
Birds sweetly singing, oh ! 
I 
met my love near Bambridge, 
'Twas my charming, blue-eyed Sally, oh! 
And she is the beauty of the County Down, 
And the flower of Mackerally, oh ! 
OVith admiration I 
did gaze, 
Upon this blooming maiden, oh! 
Adam was never more struck 
When he first saw Eve in Eden, oh 1 
Her skin was like the lily while, 
That blooms in yonder valley, oh ! 
And I 
think I 
am blessed when night 
To the flower of Mackerally, oh! 
Her yellow hair, in ringlets fair, 
Her shoes were Spanish leather, oh ! 
Her bonnet with blue ribbons strung, 
And her scarlet scarf and feather, oh! 
Like a 
Venus bright she did appear, 
Did my charming, blue-eyed Sally, oh! 
And she's the girl that I 
love dear, 
And the flower of Mackerally, oh! 
An Irish lad although I 
be, 
have neither wealth nor treasure, oh ! 
Yet I 
love my dearest dear— 
I 
love her beyond measure, oh I 
If I 
had all the wealth that is possessed, 
Arrah ! by the great Mackerally, oh! 
I 
would give it to her I 
love best, 
L. 
She's the flower of Mackerally, oh! 
But I 
hope the time will surely come, \ 
When we'll join hands together, oh I 
It's then I'll take my darling home, 
In spite of wind and weather, oh! 
But let them all say what they will, 
' Yes, let them scheme and rally, oh! 
,For 1 
shall take my darling home, 
he' a 
the flower of Mackerally, oh! 
BRID 
GET PICKLM. 
I SUPPOSE you have all been in love 
On some occasion or other, 
So have I, with a 
turtle dove, 
And would have mart led her, but for her brother ; 
Her name is sour, but she is sweet, 
Her cognomen it is Pickles, 
And when I 
ever chance to meet, 
My heart she always tickles. 
CHORUS. 
Bridget Pickle (Symph.) 
Thou art so fickle, (Symph.) 
With love's sickle, (Symph.) 
Thou has tickled my heart away from me. 
She'd teeth like cross-eyed rows of corn, 
Her countenance was vegetation; 
She's turned the heads of every swain, 
And dandelion in creation. 
Her cheek is reddish—like a 
beet, 
Her turn-up nose with talking wiggles, 
With carroty hair and double ( XX) feet, 
She isn't sour, although she's Pickles. 
Bridget Pickle, etc. 
I 
followed her to her parents' house, 
And saw the number on the door, 
I 
silently glided—quiet as a 
mouse, 
To catch a 
glance of her eye once more. 
She looked at me, oh, my! how sweet, 
It went through my heart like an arrow, 
I'll try some day to marry her, 
Tho' all my feelings she's harrowed. 
Bridget Pickle, etc.

WHAT IS IT ? 
COMIC CHARACTER SONG. 
Words and Music by lioNLy 
Sung with immense success by JAMES 
O'NEIL. 
Music published and Copyright, 189, by E. II. HAI:DING. 
The Music of this song, will be sent to any address, post paid, on receipt 
of price, 40 cents. 
les very strange, indeed, to me, 
.That go where'er I 
may, 
So many remarks I 
hear 
About me every day. 
'Twos Nit last night upon the street 
"My style the boys did quiz, 
And one says " you can have it, pards, 
if you can guess what it is ! " 
SPOKEN.--As soon as they saw me, they shouted, 
" 
Here it comes 1" and as I 
approached they all began 
to sing,— 
CHORUS. 
What is it, Heavens, what is it ? 
Is it a 
chrome ? 
Does it live, do you know ? 
Did it blow out or did it grow out ? 
For Heaven's sake what is it ? 
'Twas in the park, a 
lively mob 
At me did talk and stare, 
‘• I 
wonder if it's loaded, and 
If that's all it's own hair,' 
It lives, it breathes," one chap did say, 
" 
Its pulse is all serene." 
Approaching me, " old krank," says he, 
" 
I'll see that you're kept green 1" 
SPORLN. — Yes. and when I 
say a 
word back, they shout, 
" 
look out for it, it's teethin' !" and then again comes 
the conundrum— 
What is it, etc. 
They asked how long I 
walked alone, 
And say " when were you canned," 
And hint, I'd look much better if 
-Upon my head I'd stand ; 
( 
1 ) 
WHAT IS IT ?—Concluded. 
And as around the square I 
walk, 
With gloves and cane and pipe, 
I 
hear them whisper ev'ry where. 
" 
I 
wonder if it's ripe ! " 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and they want to know if I'm natural 
or artificial, and how many of me there are in a 
bunch, 
and whether I'm good raw! 
But above all, they wildly 
ask— 
What is it, etc. 
THE JOLLY IRISH SPORTS. 
Written and Sung by JACK CONROY and JAB. 
W E'RE a 
couple of high-toned men ; 
That's what the people say, 
We belong to the upper ten, 
And our style is neat and gay ; 
The ladies all at us smile, 
And say we're full of our tricks, 
Their hearts we do beguile 
And we carry our gold-headed sticks. 
CHORUS. 
With our I, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ha, ha, 
Sure we always tra la la la, 
With our tita tit tit tit ta, 
We never smoke a 
pipe 
But a 
La Tinidad Cigar, 
Chinese Cigars we hate, we belong to the 
Board of Health, 
And we're always able to treat, 
We're the boys that carry the wealth. 
In summer when we are out, 
To Long Branch we resort, 
The swells they point us out 
As the Jolly Old Irish Sports. 
Whenever we get in a 
fight, 
We're bound to make them sick, 
We strike out left and right, 
Sure we always could handle the stick 
With our 1, 2, 3, etc.

JOLLY OLD IRISH FARMER . 
W ords by DAVID ROCHE and sung by him in the beautiful Irish 
Drama, " Colleen Ruaidh." 
I'm a 
jolly old Irish farmer, 
Light hearted, contented you see, 
A 
widower too in the bargain, 
And I'm sorry for that as can be ; 
Ah, but I 
have the fairest of daughters, 
She's the brightest of girls ever seen, 
Oh, the pride of my heart, she's a 
darling, 
My gweet little dear Kathaleen. 
CHORUS. 
She's the pride of my heart in the morning, 
With her tricks and her games by the score. 
A 
laugh and a 
song the whole day long, 
Herself and young Terence O'Moore. 
She is up with the lark in the morning, 
Lilting some plaintive song of her own, 
The birds and the sunshine revealing, 
The cosiest picture of home. 
Her loud merry laugh would delight you, 
So bewitching a 
colleen is she, 
She's the light of my soul. 
Oh the darling, 
And dearer than all to me. 
CHORT:S. 
She's the pride of my heart in the morning, 
With her tricks and her games by the score. 
A 
laugh and a 
song the whole day long, 
Herself and young Terence O'Aloore.

-WHERE CAN MY LITTLE BROTHER BE? 
Sung by H ARRY OSBORNE. 
Where can my little brother be'? 
Why ever did he stray 1. 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away ; 
To bring him back, my love is such, 
I 
must some plan devise, 
My grief is when I 
think how much 
'Twill cost to advertise. 
CHORUS. 
Where can my little brother be 1 
Can he have gone away, 
To study hard at Botany, 
Afar in Botany Bay I 
lie's six feet high and very lean, 
His length's his chiefest charm, 
His boots are twelves, his gloves sixteens, 
He's tatoo'd on his arm ; 
His face a 
noble cast was deetu'd, 
A 
cast his optics bore, 
His Roman nose turn'd up, and seem'd 
To say Excelsior. 
Clones. 
Where can my little brother be 1 
Why ever did he stray ? 
His loss has been a 
blow to me, 
I'll hope he'll stay away. 
'Twas doubtful when I 
saw him, for 
His form was faint and dim; 
You could not quite be sure which was 
His shadow, which was him ; 
His legs were like the pelican's, 
So tall he seem'd indeed, 
With graceful neck, long as the swan's, 
A 
hop pole run to seed. 
• 
Where can, etc. 
His voice it is a 
baritone, 
And if you heard him try 
To sing, I 
feel assured it would bring 
A 
tear into your eye; 
His upper notes are like the lark's, 
His lower notes are groans ; 
Perhaps the Negro Minstrels have 
Bought him up for bones. 
Where can, etc.

THE IRISH ACTOR. 
As sung by the late SAM. COLLINS, England's greatest Irish Comic 
Ma.—" Pat's Curiosity Shop." 
By way of an introduction, my name is Mr. Denis O'Shea, 
Long before I 
was born, so they tell me, I 
wrote a 
most illigant 
play; 
The poetry, plot, and conception, e'en the great Shakespeare 
couldn't surpass ; 
'Twits pertaining to tragedy, comedy, opera, burlesque, and 
farce; 
It so puzzled the play-folks to act it that it was going to be put 
on the shelf, 
So I 
popped up behind the green curtain and acted the whole 
play myself. 
SPOKEN.— Sure and faith, precocious talent was the family 
badge of the O'Shea's. 
My father could say the alphabet before 
he could speak, and strutted and fretted his hours on the stage 
'fore he was short- coated ; but for the matter of that, he was al-
ways siort-coated, for the only coat he had to his back was a 
pair of leather breeches, and were down at the heel ; but as 
Shakespeare says in his play of Umphry Clinker— 
" 
0 
I 
that estates and offices were given to the merit of the winner, 
how many hungry mouths would be well fed, 
how many be well clad, ‘vhin they were naked, 
How many be employed whin out of work, 
How many have full pockets that are empty." 
Sure and faith, it was just so with father, for he always had the 
most labor to do when he was out of work ; and he was a 
man of 
strict honor, that he always wasied Iti$ hands of a 
dirty action Le-
15 
THE IRISH ACTOR.—Continued. 
fore he did it, so that he even commanded respect from the great 
that were dead and buried; and he used to say as Shakespeare 
said in the words of Ben Johnson : 
Put honor in one eye and your fist in the other, 
And I'll see them both in blindness, 
Is I 
love the name of honor more than I 
do the first. 
CHORUS. 
Am.—" St. Patrick was a 
Gentleman." 
That I'm an actor bred and born, sure there's no one can deny, 
sirs, 
At my tragedy they laugh, at my comedy they cry, sirs ; 
My voice and action's just t -17' style, in favor I'm advancin,z, 
And instead of singing of my songs, by the powers they're done 
by dancing. 
SPOKEN.—Arrah, sure I'm the broth of a 
hoy for that same, as 
Shakespeare says in the words of Goldsmith— 
" 
Many a 
flower is born to blush unseen, 
Looked but coldly on sure everywhere." 
And wasn't Shakespeare a 
sample of that same. William Shake-
speare was born at Stratford in Bow in the county Cork, the north 
part of Ireland; he showed marks of very early genius in his 
youth, and paid great attention to his learning by playing the 
truant every day he went to school. 
He passed his time in 
poaching and deer stealing, which so delighted the lord of the 
manner that he gave youno- Shakespeare three months in New-
gate, only Billy gave them leg- bail, and escaped from prison be-
fore they got him in it; so he walked every step of the way to 
London by riding in a 
wacron; but after all he couldn't dance a 
song like this-_---( Dances am frieh jig.)

Words by DAVE ROCHE, sung by the great Artists KERRIGAN & 
MCCARTHY, Irish Pipers, Reel and Jig Dancers, with great 
success. 
Ant.—" I 
Hold the Winning Iland. 
WE 
sailed across the stormy sea 
To America's free land, 
As strangers we present ourselves, 
To gain the warm grasp of your hand. 
We will try and please you every one, 
So let your glasses foam, 
And drink in sociability 
With the Bards of dear Tyrone. 
CHORUS. 
For we are from the old sod, 
Yes, from there we did roam, 
Where we have spent our happiest days, 
The Bards of dear Tyrone. 
For wit and humor, Irishmen 
Cannot be beat, my boys, 
Wherever they appear they turn 
Your sorrows into joys. 
This is our object here, kind friends, 
Though your hearts may feel as stone, 
We trust we've pleased, and now take leave, 
We are off for dear Tyrone.

SWELLS OF THE DAY. 
Comic Song, by BEN COLLINS, Esq. 
Sung by PAT ROONEY. 
Copyrighted, 1879, by CLurron T. DE 
Wxrr. 
Now a 
comical song I'm going to sing, 
And I 
think you'll agree with inc too, 
It's about the young men we every day meet, 
And the facts I 
believe are all true. 
They'll stand on the corner for twenty-four hours, 
They'll wink, and they'll blink, and they'll stare ; 
With Sherman House toothpicks and three-cent cigars, 
And bad hair oil all over their hair. 
CHORUS. 
They are the swells of the day, 
Oh, that's what the police all say ; 
Their gold watch is brass, their diamonds are glass, 
But still they're the swells of the day. 
They'll hang around our large hotels, 
A 
burden to the city ; 
To see them on a 
rainy day, 
Wouldn't move your pocket to pity. 
They'll spit tobacco all over the walk, 
I 
wish they were in Jerusalem; 
There is Augustus, George, Girard, and Oliver, 
And Don Pedro alamagozlems. 
CHORUS. 
They're par excellence, 
I 
wish they'd leave the town ; 
Why can't they go out West, 
Or where they can't be found ? 
Oh my, them second-hand hats; 
Look dizzier every day; 
I 
wish. they were buried with Brigham Young, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
They'll bow to every lady 
And they'll try and look their best ; 
They'll button up that linen duster 
To bide their old-time vest. 
They'll go in a 
bar-room, step up to the counter 
And drink when they know they can't pay ; 
If the bartender murmurs " Please settle that round," 
They'll wink their brunette eye and say— 
CHORUS. 
By-and-by, by-and-by, they'll say 
" 
Charge it," and then hurry to the door; 
" 
Drink with me, tra la la le, 
I 
will treat on that beautiful shore."

And every time I'd chance to meet 
My old chum, Peter Green, 
He'd say,." Why, Brown, you've not one yet, 
And I've got seventeen."

said, " Yon

Peter?

peculiar kind of a

said I—Cno.

W E 
are a 
jolly couple, 
As you can plainly see, 
We are always gay and frisky, 
No matter where we be. 
If you wish to hear an Irish song 
in the real old-fashioned style, 
Just pay attention to us— 
As we are from Erin's Isle. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and the boys say one to another, as we 
are passing by, " Who are they ? " " Why, don't you 
know them ? that's 
CHORUS. 
Peg and Tim, Peg and Tim, 
They have lots of ready money, 
Touch a 
shin, Dandy Tim, 
And she's as sweet as honey ; 
When we walk in the park 
Or the Opera La Ilonffe, 
The people say, " Ain't they gay— 
That's Tim and Peg McDuff." 
We were at a 
social party, 
A 
rather festive crowd, 
The other night at Harlem, 
Sure they all were very loud ; 
There was Alderman McMadden, 
Red-headed Mike McCue, 
An Irishman from China--
We were a 
jolly crew. 
SPOKEN. 
There was singing, dancing, eating and 
drinking, when the Irish Chinaman requested us to sing 
an Italian song from the Opera of the Lakes of Killarney. 
Well, we obliged him with a French ditty that went

IRELAND'S SHORE. 
Composed by JOE A. 
BURGESS, and sung with immense isuccess by 
Miss ANNIE BURGESS. 
IN 
a 
little cottage neatly built 
Upon old Ireland's shore, 
Where the shamrock and the thistle grows so free, 
Lives a 
colleen dear so sweet and fair. 
Upon that Isle so green, 
And her dear face now I 
often lowg to see. 
CHORUS. 
But she's far away from me across the deep blue sea, 
Could I 
but see her bright sweet face once more, 
And when we met as strangers, 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again ; 
She's my darling treasure, 
Pride of Ireland's shore, 
Oh, my love for her has grown stronger 
Since we met on Erin's shore, 
And I 
long to see the land where I 
was born, 
And to tell the love that I 
have cherished 
All those years for her, 
And to hear her kind heart's answer in return. 
But she's far away, etc. 
I 
have seen the Isle so green, 
I've gained my fair colleen, 
Her love so pure is mine forevermore, 
And when we met as strangers 
Then I 
vowed we'd meet again; 
I've my darling treasure, pride of Ireland's shore. 
But she's far away, etc. 
DEAD IN LOVE. 
Words by HARRY BEET. 
Of mg with great success by IlAnmy WoonsoN at the Howard Ithenreum, 
Boston. 
I'm in love with a 
charming young damsel ; 
She's a 
native of Ireland in Greece, 
And her father knits socks for the sparrows, 
While her mother is on the police. 
She can wrestle mince pies like a 
darling, 
Or juggle a 
big schooner of beer. 
She's a 
thorough-bred long-winded luncher„ 
With a 
seven pound wart on her ear. 
This yoting girl is a 
talented eater, 
And the grub that she stuffs down her throat 
Would supply a 
whole orphan asylum, 
Or sink a 
large-sized ferry-boat. 
She can swallow a 
whole water-melon, 
And to bite it she iever will stoop ; 
She can take forty encores on lager, 
And she likes rubber shoes in her soup. 
0, her mouth's like a 
busted tomattus, 
And her eyes like an overgrown moon, 
And she stands seven feet in her ear-rings, 
With a 
head like a 
bar-room spittoon ; 
And she sleeps with her feet in the hallway, 
For she can't get them inside the door. 
If I 
marry this healthy young lady 
I'll buy out a 
Dutch grocery store.

A MAN AIN'T A HORSE IF HE'S BORN IN A 
STABLE . 
Sung by BLLI.T ASHCROFT. 
Ain.—" Our Grandfathers' Days." 
OF 
an illig,ant family, near Tipperary, 
As dacent a 
lot as e'er shouldered a

was sprung, and so thinking the prospect to vary, 
Left my old ancient ancestors' home, and the sod; 
I'd a 
twist of the brogue I 
determined to alter, 
And speak native Etrlish—jinteel of course ; 
If bred up a 
foreigner, why should I 
falter ? 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse. 
Tel de rol, etc. 
To be hired for a 
footman, I'd fixed it complately, 
To a 
great man who hated a 
tight Irish lad, 
And would not keep a 
servant but talked English nately, 
I 
f 
a 
divil a 
one on the earth could be had; 
" 
What arc you," says he.—" Why an EOlishman, honey " 
" 
Where born 2"—Why, in Ireland, my jewel of coursL" 
" 
That can't be. 
It can, sir; 
I'll bet any money. 
Though born jn a

man ain't a 
horse." 
Tol de rol, etc. 
He gabb'd and he c'ue,tered his cockneyshire blarney--
Bade me and ley bro -r,ue to the divil go roam; 
Says I, " If Bow- bells was the lakes of Killarney, 
The divil a 
cockney would be horn at home!" 
Cries he, `• You pronounce neither one thing nor Ember.' 
Says I, " Eve a 
tongue sure, for better for worse ; 
'Bout pronouucification, then, why make a 
bother ? 
Though born in a 
stable a 
man ain't a 
horse." 
Tol de rol, etc. 
At last all the innkeeper, where'er I 
enter'd, 
Bawl'd, " Put down the potatoes !" by way of disgrace. 
" 
Where

Be my soul they must see I've the brogue la my face !" 
So thou,Th I

My plump Irish features betray me of course ! 
Yet I

I'm sitting alone while the sunset is falling,

And. the throstle so sweetly his love note is calling, 
From out the old willow that bends o'er the rill. 
I 
see the old cottage, with woodbine half cover'd, 
The one brightest spot in that beautiful scene ; 
But where is the spirit that round it once hover'd, 
So loving and gentle, oh! where is Kathleen ?

Where is Kathleen, darling Kathleen ? 
She who was ever my heart's fondest queen ! 
Where is the sweetheart I 
loved in my childhood ? 
I 
hear but the echo, oh ! where is Kathleen ? 
I 
turn from the spot with a 
heart full of sorrow, 
To think of the path I 
must tread all alone ; 
For no matter how bright be the sun of to-morrow, 
I'll sigh for the love-light that once o'er me shone. 
Though far from the scenes by her presence once glad-
den'd, 
I 
still shall remember sweet days that have been ; 
And the voice of my heart, tho' tis broken and sadden'd, 
Will ever be calling, oh! where is Kathleen ? 
Where is Kathleen, etc.

DUKES' RESORT. 
Written and sung by the Great Character Vocalist, DAVID ROCHE, 
with great success. 
THERE is a 
place of great renown, 
Of it I'm going to sing, 
It's not on the European plan, 
Nor any such a 
thing ; 
The guests are all substantial men, 
I 
must not fail to tell, 
Or they could not live in luxury 
At the Financiers' Hotel. 
CHORUS. 
There is Professor Chandler, 
A Duke from Ireland, 
With seedy clothes, no money, 
Yet very proud and grand ; 
There is a 
Prince from Germany, 
Neckties, he makes, to sell, 
To cover up the paper fronts 
Of the guests at the hotel. 
The other night a 
stranger came 
To stop at the hotel, 
The would-be dukes and princes 
Received him kind and well ; 
They entertained him finely, 
In the morning he arose 
And found he'd lost his boots and hat 
And his Sunday suit of clothes. 
There is Professor Chandler, etc. 
There is a 
fine dressed gentleman, 
Does naught but walk the street, 
Some say he is a 
banker's son, 
Others, a 
famous beat ; 
He lives up on Fifth Avenue, 
But the truth to you I'll tell, 
He swopped his home for a 
better 
At the Financiers' Hotel. 
There is Professor Chandler, etc.

THE .1.771VI2 CENT SHAVE. 
Written, composed and sung by Tom CANNON. 
On t I'm going to tell to you of the troubles I 
went hrough 
In a 
barber's shop that isn't very far away. 
My beard it being strong, I 
thought ' twould not be wrong, 
To go and have it trimmed a 
bit the other day ; 
And being short of cash, it struck me like a 
flash, 
That five cents was enough to pay in these hard times. 
So I 
went into a 
place, as I 
thought it no disgrace, 
To practice strict economy and save my dimes, 
SPOKEN.—Yes, I 
went into one of these barber's shops, where 
they give you a 
shave for five cents and throw in a 
chromo. 
Well ! the fellow put rim into a 
chair and took down a 
small 
bottle off the shelf and was going to put it to my nose. What's 
that *I 
says I. 
Chloroform, says he. I 
didn't come here to have 
my teeth pulled out, says I. 
Oh, well, says he, if you can 
stand it I 
can. 
Go ahead, says 1. 
CHORUS. 
So he lathered me, he slathered me, he bruised me and abusod 
me, 
He tore me, and nearly drove me to my grave. 
He tickled me, he pickled me, he scratched ine and he patcheti 
me, 
And I'd rather have the measles than his five cent shave. 
I 
stood it for awhile, I 
tried in vain to smile, 
lie talked about the weather as he scratched away ; 
He took me by the hair and held me in the chair, 
I 
thought my days were numbered and began to pray ; 
At length I 
gave a 
roar, says I, I 
want no more. 
Here ! you can have my pocket- book, but spare my life, 
Take all that I 
possess, and finish my distress, 
I 
cannot stand the torture of your slaughter- house knife. 
Sroxpx.—You ought, to see the way he went about it. 
The 
first thing I 
knew he had his knee upon my chest and was 
sawing away like a 
day's work. 
And then he called out to the 
fellow that. cleans the spittoon ; here, Emanuel, come and put 
sonic grease on this rtzor, I'm stuck. 
Well, between the two 
they finally got it out, and I 
looked in the glass, and by the 
hokey my face was all marked out in town lots. 
What's this 
you have on my face 1 
I 
says. 
Oh ! well, he says, we expect 
our customers to come back, and that's a 
diagram of the route. 
Well, says I, you may call this a 
clean shave, but I 
call it a 
clean skin and a 
barefaced one at that, and l'll never go there 
again, because, 
So It 
lathered me, etc.

SKIN-TIGHT PANTS. 
written by JAMES BP.ADLEY. 
Sung by CONROY and DALY. 
I'M Mrs. Muldoon, the solid man's wife, 
On that I 
ve no reason blow ; 
But I've got a 
son, who's a 
son of a 
gun, 
And to work sure he never will go; 
Ile is following his father's examples, 
Looking for every chaticct; 
But every one knows he's a 
big overgrown 
While he wears his skin-tight pants. 
CHORUS. 
His head is as red as the ginger-bread. 
I'm afraid he will never advance, 
Or Ho to the front like ins father, John, 
While he keeps on the skin-tight pants. 
My sister from Kerry, she's an aunt to Jerry, 
Told me a 
tale one night; 
She said he was a 
pivoter. 
She was told by And Wright ; 
I 
know it's true, yes, every word, 
For he goes to every dance, 
And he wears his father's long- tail coat 
To hide his skin-tight pants.

If John gets the nomination 
Poi- alderman next fall, 
I'll buy my Jerry a 
bran new suit, 
Like the paper on the wall ; 
And then we'll have a 
raffle, 
At fifty cents a 
chance ; 
Max' the best man throw high or low, 
To will poor Jerry's pants. 
His head, etc, 
My Jerry will go to a 
boarding- school, 
To join the college grade. 
And when he's there a 
year or more, 
Of course he'll learn a 
trade ; 
Then I'll send him to speak the French, 
I 
will pay his passage to France ; 
When he goes he can turn up his nose 
To those that made fun )f 
his pants.

CHICKENS IN THE GARDEN . 
As 
sung by Jomst W ILSON with great success. 
I 
ONCE did know a 
farmer, a 
good old jolly soul, 
Who used to work upon the farm around his country 
home; 
He had an only daughter, and to win her I 
did try, 
And when I 
asked him for her hand these words he did 
reply : 
CHOIWS. 
Treat my daughter kindly, and say you'll do no harm, 
Anti when I 
die I'll leave to you my little house and farm, 
My horse, my plow, my sheep, my cow, my hogs, and 
little barn, - 
And all those little chickens in the garden. 
I 
own I 
love this darling girl, and dearly she loves me, 
I 
used to go around her home her smiling face to see ; 
To watch her milk her father's ducks and admire her 
every charm, 
And many a 
drink of milk I 
got before I 
left the barn. 
SPOKEN.—Yes, and the old man would join our hands 
together, putting one of his own on each of our heads, 
he would say, God bless yon, little children, and young 
man, remember, I'll break your back if you don't always— 
Treat my daughter, etc. 
Now the old man has consented, rind tr,-rried we will be. 
We'll own a 
little farm oumelves and live, in harmony ; 
I'll use her well, his only child, and I'll treat her kindly, 
And I'll strive to keep the promise that the old man asked 
of me. 
SPOKEN. — And oh, Lord ! how his eyes used to twinkle, 
and how it used to tickle me every time I'd hear him say— 
Treat my daughter, etc.

NY GOOD OLD IRISH HOME. 
AIR 
My 
Old Kentucky Home." 
Och, my heart still yearns for my good old Irish home, 
Through grieving may be all in vain, 
Bad luck till the day that I 
ever thought to roam, 
By the powers he brought in a 
dozen. 
What a 
daldum they'd have knocked us in, 
If I 
hadn't ' ave had this Darling Old Stick ! 
War ! was the word, when a 
faction came In, 
For they pummelled me well—they stripped off to the skin! 
Like a 
rector I 
stood, watching the attack, 
And the first one came up I 
knocked on his back 1 
Then I 
poked out the eye of Pat Glancy, 
For he once htunbuged my sister Nancy ! 
In the meantime Miss Kate took a 
fancy 
To me and my innocent Stick 1 
I 
smattered her sweetheart until he was black, 
Kate tipped me the wink we were off in a 
thwack! 
We went till a 
house at the end of a 
town, 
Where we kept up our spirits by pouring some down ! 
There the whisky began for to warm her, 
I 
got her sung up in a 
corner ; 
She said her sweetheart would inform on her 
Twas there I 
said praise to my stick

Kate she drank whisky to such a 
degree 
That for her support she had to lean upon me; 
I 
said I 
would see her safe till her abode 
'Tis there that we fell in the middle of the road. 
Until aroused by the magistrate's orders, 
Devil a 
toe could we go farther, 
Surnmuded by policeman for murder, 
Was myself and my innocent Stick. 
When I 
was acquitted I 
jumped from the dock, 
An' all the gay fellers around me did flock ; 
The quarter I 
spint and with Larry I 
wint, 
To Oak street we traveled from Cherry, 
At -aich shebeen we'd stop to take a 
small dhrop, 
Be the time we got there we wor merry. 
As the (lure we passed through, what a

All me piwers of decription 'twould baffle, 
In a

THE ECCENTRIC MAN. 
Composed and sung with immense success in all the ptincipal 
Cities of the United States and Canada, by DATE ROCHE, of 
the " Osborne Comedy Company." 
THREE years ago I 
came here from Ireland 
And lived with my thirty-second cousin, Mike ; 
He's an alderman, yes, an Irish brigand, 
With Italians in Ireland he carried a 
pike. 
expect an office of him some day, 
Inspecting, well, something in the City Hall, 
And when I 
find that I 
get good pay, 
wear a 
silk hat, right sleek and tall. 
I 
was introduced to the Mayor, and proudly 
For a 
good position I 
did quickly ask ; 
He looked at me and said, profoundly, 
"I have it for you, and it is no task ; 
Take the East River Bridge, lay it over Lake Huron, 
Bring the Central Park into Brooklyn Town, 
Shift the Elevated Roads from here to Jerusalem, 
Then come to-morrow and see my clerk, Brown."

AIR.—" The Hat My Father Wore.' 
On, here I 
am, my darlings, 
Now if you only listen 
Awhile to me, I'll tell you 
About where I 
came from. 
Sure when I 
left Ireland, 
About six months ago, 
I 
landed at Castle Garden 
At the Battery down below. 
I 
thought it was a 
purty place, 
But things they were too slow, 
So I 
went to Cincinnati 
In the State of 0-ho-ho. 
(Dance.) 
My mother was a 
Fagan, 
My father was a 
Reagan, 
So now speak out, my darlings, 
Once more before I 
go. 
I'd rub for him, I'd scrub for him, 
From morning until night, 
I'd get up in the morning first, 
The fire for to light. 
So now speak out, my buckoos, 
Once more before I 
go, 
For Pm off to Cincinnati 
In the State of 0-ho-ho.

Am.—" The Ito-rini Irish Boy." 
1.11, name it is Magee, an Irish girl d'ye see, 
And night and day I'm light and gay, 
For that's the style for me ; 
I'm up to any rig, and can dance an Irishliz, 
And for the troubles of the world, 
I 
doesn't care a

But now Fm going to tell you of 
A boy that just suits me, 
A

So happy, light and free.

ALWAYS SPEAK A KIND WORD WHEN YOD 
CAN. 
Sung by NED BARRY. 
Ant.-4
, 
Slavery Days." 
STRANGE sayings are the rage, on the street and on the 
stage, 
And many glorious maxims you will find ; 
But there's one more than the rest seems to linger on my 
breast, 
And very oft comes stealing o'er my mind ; 
I'll sing a 
song to-night of a 
motto true and bright, 
A 
lesson it conveys sublime and grand: 
To the beggar at your door, or any one that's poor, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you can. 
Now, there's many a 
man who great riches does command, 
But his praises and his honors they are small ; 
But when he's dead and gone, they'll speak of him and 
mourn, 
And. say how good that he had been to all. 
And while upon this earth, struggling hard through life, 
No one would assist him in his plans ; 
But his stories they relate when they know it is too late, 
For they never speak a 
kind, word when they can. 
The workingman to-day with his poor and scanty pay, 
Striving very hard his family to maintain ; 
While the rich they stay at home with the riches that they 
own, 
The poor may ask assistance all in vain. 
When humble is your lot in the wretched laborer's cot, 
Don't pass them by, but take them by the hand ; 
Don't turn your head away, but remember what I 
say, 
Always speak a 
good and kind word when you ern.

SCANLON. 
IN 
summer time when all is fine. 
And the trees and grass are green ; 
When the boys are drinking lager beer, 
And everything's serene, 
On Toni McDonnell's old tin roof, 
The boys do dance at night, 
With Kitty Malone and Mary Shea, 
Who sing with all their might. 
They have a 
big accordeon, 
The music it is grand, 
You'll hear them shout for miles away ; 
Faith, they never will go home, 
While they can have a 
tune 
And " Tracy" on his instruments will play, 
CHORUS. 
It's polkas, waltzes, quadrilles all the night, 
'Tis finer than the 0p'ra Bouffe ; 
If you don't believe I'm right, call around there any 
night, 
And you'll find us on Mel)ionnell's old tin roof. 
They call themselves the midnight owls, 
They dance by light of moon, 
To start for 'ionic at two o'clock, 
They say it is too soon. 
They keep the folks awake all night, 
They never have their rest, 
To sing their songs and play their tunes 
They do their level best. 
The music it is charming, 
It really is divine, 
'Tis finer than the Op'ra BoufTe ; 
When they do the Boston dip, 
Faith, the house rocks like a 
ship, 
Oh, there's no place like McDonnell's old tin 
roof. 
It's polkas, waltzes, etc. 
Across the street from where I 
live, 
A 
German keeps a 
store, 
He is a 
baker man by trade, 
He's worth a 
thousand or more. 
He keeps about five men at work, 
Of course they're up all night, 
But when they hear the music play, 
They shoat with great delight. 
About the time the bread is baled 
The boys and girls descend, 
They don't stop till they've reached the door ; 
And they'll skip across the street, 
And the bread they'll nip so neat, 
Oh, you ought to hear the bakers how they 
roar. 
It's polkas, waltzes, etc.

Mr. and Mrs. Malone.” 
HEnE we are from old Ireland, 
We have crossed the deep blue sea, - 
And now as we're here in America, 
We will live in harmony. 
We have travelled through this world of care 
Without the least reproach, 
For we are of high family, 
And the French of our name is "do Roche. " 
CHORUS. 
We are Michael and Marian Roach, 
Our names ye can never reproach ; 
Such a 
funny old pair you never will see 
As Michael and Marian Roach. 
Times are hard in old Ireland, 
The truth to you we tell, 
But still The poor are not alone, 
God bless the good Parnell ! 
He is fighting as O'Connell did 
In the days gone by, galore, 
When Robert Emmett and all such men 
For freedom vowed and swore.

MY 'MARY .ANIN.T. 
Sung to great applause by JOHN CONROt, 
O H, I 
have a 
girl—she looks like a 
queen— 
Her hair it is red, and her age is sixteen; 
She's just like a 
fairy you'd see in your dream, 
And in fact she's the sweetest that ever was seen ; 
She plays the piano, and sings " Aileen Allanna, 
With a 
voice so soprano, so low, and so sweet ; 
But when she sits down to play " Lakes of Killarney,' 
She frightens the people all off fron the street. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, you should see Mary, so sly and contrary ; 
She's like a 
canary from sweet Tipperary ; 
She is not a 
bit airy ; she ' tends to her dairy, 
So airy—contrary—is my Mary Ann, 
I 
took Mary one night to a 
massacre 
To a 
place down below they call Wall Halla 
And when she got there, she went straight for the grub; 
The way that she eat was like filling a 
tub. 
She called for the turkey, the quail, and the oysters ; 
She ate onions and garlic, to make her breath sweet; 
13ut her mouth when it opened her breath was so strong 
That it knocked the people clean off from their seats. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
You'll find her at all of the blow- outs and parties , 
She dances the polka, mazurka and all ; 
And when she is at it she goes it so hearty 
That she knocks the plaster all off from the wall. 
We were down at McN.ally's one night at a 
party, 
And to make things look lively, she whipped off he: 
shoes. 
Her feet, when she shook them, threw out such a 
flavor, 
That it drove all Vile people clean out of the room. 
Oh, you should see Mary, etc. 
BIDDY MULDOON. 
As sung with great simcess by DAN COLLYES. 
Now, Biddy, I 
see you a-peepin" so sly, 
The stars are a-looking from out of the sky, 
The nightingale warbles his purtiest tune, 
Ho knows I 
am lovin' you, Biddy Muldoon. 
The grass it is wet, and I'm catchin' a 
cold, 
And, Biddy, now don't you be thinking me bold, 
Just open the dure and I'll go away soon, 
For I'm crazy wid love of you, Biddy Muldoon, 
CHORUS. 
Biddy, Biddy, Biddy Muldoon, 
Open the window and look at the moon ; 
I'd knock any man in the middle of June, 
If I 
catch him a 
courtiu' you, Biddy Muldoon, 
Now, Biddy, my darling, you're laughing, I'm sure, 
Oh come down, my jewel, and open the dare; 
Would you let a 
man fraze, on an evenin' in June, 
When you could revive him, dear Biddy Muldoon ? 
If the old man's awake, bless the name that he bears, 
He'd think its a 
rat that is stealing up stairs ; 
'Twould be a 
good joke on the swate old gossoon, 
For he won't know I'm courtin' you, Biddy Muldoon.

HURRAH for dear old Ireland ! 
That diamond in the sea ; 
We've drowned our sorrow, dance and sing, 
Sure we're always full of glee ! 
We've heard of other countries, 
di climes so rich and rare, 
But there cannot be a 
happier home 
Than sunny, sweet Kildare.

The dear land of our fathers, 
We are longing to be there, 
To see the sunburst rising 
On thy green hills, Kildare. 
(Repeat Chorus.) 
The little sprig of shamrock, 
It proves but one in three, 
Springing from dear Erin's soil, 
That plant of liberty. 
St. Patrick he revered it, 
So let this be our prayer, 
That the emblem of our country 
May wave triumphant there. 
CHORUS. 
The dear land of our fathers, 
We are longing to be there, 
ro see the sunburst rising 
On thy green hills, Kildare.

O'ER THE H ILLS AND DALES SO GRAND. 
Written by E. DAVIS, expressly for JEN.NIE HUGHES. 
I 
CAME from dear ould Ireland with very little money, 
I 
crossed the great big ocean, the Yankee folks to see, 
I've heard of great big wonders, but very few I've seen now, 
So if you'll wait, why I'll relate the wonders which I've seen. 
Of the hills and dales so grand, that's seen in Paddy's land. 
The boys and girls of our dear Isle, so beautiful to see, 
Driving on a 
jaunting car, with Paddy by my side, 
When the moon is shining brightly, along the road we glide. 
There's the " Dargle " and the " Devil's Glen," in the County 
Wicklow, 
The sweet Lakes of Killarney, in Kerry County too, 
Not forgetting " Blarney Castle," you all know what I 
mean 
now, 
For there of course the boys all go• t's kiss the Blarney stone. 
NO TIDINGS FROM OVER THE SEA.. 
Sung by DAVE ROCHE with well-
merited success. 
I 
HAVE waited so long now, my darling, 
To hear from you day after day, 
For you promised to send me a 
message, 
Oh, tell me, why do you delay ? 
You know that my heart is so lonely 
Since I 
have been parted from thee, 
For each day passing by brings no message 
From over the deep blue sea. 
CHORUS. 
No tidings from over the sea, 
No sweet words of love, dear to me, 
Each day passing by brings no message, 
No tidings from over the sea. 
Oh, you promised you'd never forget me, 
Nor the waves of the sea e'er divide, 
Though the billows of blue roll between us, 
In my thoughts you are still by my side. 
My lips feel your kisses no longer, 
And ever my heart calls for thee, 
For each day passing by brings no letter 
No tidings from over the sea. 
CHORUS. 
No tidings from over the sea, 
No sweet words of love, dear to me, 
Each day passing by brings no letter, 
No tidings from over the sea.

PATRIOTS OF IRELAND. 
Sung by JAMES O'NEtt., the Great Irish Vocalist. 
Now, friends, if you will listen I'll sing to you a 
song 
Of Ireland and her sons we loved so dear; 
There were patriots and heroes, and their names we love 
to hear, 
For the green they were not afraid to wear. 
There was one so young and noble, who for his country 
died, 
To remember him the Irish won't forget ; 
Perhaps you've read his speeches in the Irish history ; 
This hero's name was Robert Emmett. 
CHOI-ZITS. 
Then give thee cheers for Ireland, 
And let the people see 
That our rifles all are ready 
To set old Ireland free. 
There's another I 
will mention, and to Irishmen most 
dear, 
And for Ireland he proved a 
useful tool, 
I 
mean Dan O'Connel, may his soul now rest in peace. 
For dearly he loved Ireland and home rule. 
There were three patriots to this world did bid good-bye 
Before they could finish their design, 
They died hand in hand trying to free their native land. 
Three martyrs, Allen, Larkin and O'Brien. 
Then give, etc. 
Now America had her heroes, and she loved them well, 
I'm sure. 
Take the history and you'll know what they have done, 
There was General Lafayette, Frenchman so true, 
And our own immortal General Washington. 
'Tis now one hundred years since the country they did 
free, 
And drove the English tyrant from our, shore, 
I 
wish that every Irishman could have the same to say, 
Then Ireland would be free for evermore. 
Then give, etc.

TN 
Derry-down- dale, when I 
wanted a 
mate, 
I 
went with my feyther a-courtin' to Kate : 
With a 
nosegay so line in ray holiday clothes, 
And my hands in my pockets a- courting 1 
goes. 
Now the weather was cool but my bosom was hot, 
My heart in a 
gallop, my old mare in a 
trot, 
And I 
was so bashful, so loving withal, 
My tongue stuck in my mouth and I 
said— nothing at all.

couldn't, how could I

I 
couldn't Nvithout it, now could I—could you ? 
Pol the rol de vol, lol de rol, id do rol lay, 
Poi the rol de rol, lol de rol, lol de rol lay. 
When I 
came to the door, I 
looked glumpish and glum, 
The rapper I 
held ' twixt my finger and thumb— 
Rap, rap 
went the rapper, Miss Kate showed her chin: 
She chuckled and buckled, I 
bowed and \vent in. 
Now I 
was as bashful as bashful could he, 
And Kitty, poor girl, was as bashful as me; 
She simpered and frowned, I 
let my hat fall, 
I 
grinned, scratched my head, and said—nothing at all. 
But 1 
would if I 
could, etc. 
Now if bashful was I, not less bashful the maid, 
She simpered and whimpered, with her apron-strings played, 
Till the old folks impatient, to have the thing done, 
Agreed little Kitty and I 
should be one. 
In silence we young uns soon nodded consent, 
hand in hand to the church, to get married, we went. 
Where we answered the parson, in voices quite small, 
Love, honor, obey, and — nothing at all. 
But we would if we could, etc. 
Now what a 
chancre in the course of a 
week 
Miss Kate left off blushimr, I 
boldly could speak, 
I 
could play with my dearie, laugh loud at a 
jest: 
She could coax, too, and fondle, avi well as the best. 
Ashamed of past follies, we often declare 
We'll encourage young folks to have in wedlock a 
share, 
And if to their aid some assurance they call, 
'bey may kiss, and get married, and do—nothincr at all. 
But they would if they could, etc.

THE TWINS FROM SKIBBEREEN. 
Words and Music by THOMAS F. 
HARTY. 
Written expressly for Mr. JAMES BRADLEY and Minn- litrAIELL. 
FERNINST you stand two Corkeys bold, 
Whose pedigree is easy told ; 
We've just landed here from the emerald isle, 
And we won't detain you hut awhile ; 
We are twins it's plainly to be seen. 
And we come from a 
place called Skibbereen 
And digging turf we'll do no more, 
Since the day we left old Erin's shore ; 
Then a 
welcome hand to us extend, 
And you'll find there's none so true a 
friend ; 
But woe be to them would go between 
The twins that come from Skibbereen. (Dance.) 
At home we were known as the Irish team, 
At a 
wake or a 
fair we could always be seen, 
And if called upon for a 
jig or a 
reel, 
We could show them the use of the toe and heel, 
And whenever there would be a 
faction light, 
In the midst of the fray would be our delight, 
For two hearts more brave were never seen 
Than the twins that come from Skibbereen ; 
Then a 
welcome hand to us extend, 
And you'll find there's 11011e so true a 
friend ; 
But woe be to them would go between 
The twins that come from Skibbereen. (Dance.) 
DIG FAT NANCE. 
Original Act by BRADLEY and W ILD. 
W HITE folks, give me your attention, 
While I'll sing to you my song, 
'Tis of my girl I'm going to mention, 
And I 
promise not to detain you long ; 
I've been courting her for many a 
day, 
And to her house I 
often go around ; 
In her stocking feet she stands six feet four, 
And weighs three hundred and fifty pounds. 
CHORUS. 
Come all ye figs, come join together. 
Take the banjo down and have a 
dance, 
For Fro going to be married next Sunday evening, 
To my great big fat and greasy Nance. 
Nancy's ma has gave consent.• 
Her father feels quite satisfied, 
Next Sunday eve I'll take her arm, 
And to the church we both shall glide ; 
She will be my vile forever, 
Lots of things for her I'll buy. 
She'll never go back on George Lapelle 
Until the very day she dies. 
Come all ye nics, etc,

THE I:AIA:a IRISH 130Y.—LCoseLunn$./ 
No roebuck more swifter can flee o'er the mountain, 
No Briton bolder 'midst danger or sear; 
He's slightly, he's lightly, he's as clear as the fountain, 
His eyes twinkling love, and he's gone to the war. 
Cho.—Smiling, beguiling, cte. 
The soft-tuning lark, its notes shall cease mourning, 
The dull screaming owl shall cease its night's sleep, 
While seeking lone walks in the shades of the evening, 
If my Connor return not, I'll never cease to weep. 
Oto.—S.iniling, beguiling, die. 
The war is all over, and my love is not returning, 
I 
fear that some envious plot has been laid, 
Or some cruel godde,s has him captivated, 
And left me to mourn here, a 
dear Irish maid. 
Cho.—Smiling, beguiling, die. 
YOU'LL SOON FORGET KATHLEEN. 
Sung by Miss JENNIE ENGEL. 
[The circumstance, which gave rise to this beautiful ballad, cxynxrred 
during the visit of a 
friend of the author to the north of Ireland, and 
was most feelingly related to the author by him. 
It was the parting of a 
young tenant-farmer from his betrothed, on going to seek his forttuma 
In some distant land.] 
Oh! leave not your Kathleen, there's no one can cheer her, 
Alone in the wide world, unpitied she'll sigh: 
And scenes that were loveliest, when thou wert but near her, 
Recall the sad visions of days long gone by! 
'Tis vain that you tell me : you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ne'er return more: 
Far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me--
You'll soon forget Kathleen, and Erin Go Bragh 
Oh! leave not the land, the sweet land ot your childhood, 
Where joyously passed the first days of our youth, 
Where gaily we wandered 'mid valley and wildwood: 
Oh! those were the bright days of innocent truth! 
'Tis vain that you tell me you'll never forget me: 
To the Land of the Shamrock you'll ue'er return more 
far away from your sight, you will cease to regret me--
You'll soon forget Kathleen, and Erin Go Bragh!

GIVE AN HONEST IRISH LAD A CHANCE. 
W ords IV DAN MCCARTHY'.

Chatham Street, New York. 
Price 40 cents. 
Copyrigh t, 
18S0, by Mrs. PAULINE LIEDER. 
Mr name is McNamara, I 
came from Cotinty Glare, 
In the darling little isle across the sea, 
Where the mountains and the hills, the lakes and rip-
pling rills 
Are singing sweetest music all the day ; 
Our little farm was small, it would not support us all, 
So one of us was forced away from home ; 
I 
bid them all ,mod-bye, with a 
teardrop in my eye, 
And I 
sailed for Castle Garden all alone. 
CHORUS. 
I 
am an honest Irish lad, of work I'm not afraid ; 
If it's pleasure to you I 
will sing or dance ; 
I'll do anything you say if you'll only name the day 
When they'll give an honest Irish lad a 
chance. 
When I 
landed in New York I 
tried hard to get work, 
And I 
travelled through the streets from day to day ; 
I 
went from place to place, with starvation in my face, 
But every place they want no help they say ; 
But still I 
wandered on, a-hoping to find one 
That would give a 
lad a 
chance to earn his bread, 
But then it's all the same, for I 
know I'm not to blame, 
And oftentimes I 
wished that I 
was dead. 
I 
am an honest Irish lad, etc. 
But I 
know I've one kind friend who will lend a 
helping 
band 
To a 
poor boy and to help him on at home ; 
I 
will bring my mother here and my little sister dear, 
And never more again from them to roam ; 
I 
will try to do what's right, I 
will work both night and 
day, 
Yes, I'll do the very best I 
can, 
And God will bless the heart that will take a 
poor boy's 
part, 
And make an honest Irish lad a 
man.

'DUFFY'S OPENING NIGHT. 
Originally sung by JACE: COINTEOT. 
DID you ever hear tell of Pat Duffy ? 
He came from the County Mayo., 
Last week, shure, he started a 
bar-room 
Down in the Fourth Ward below. 
There was lager, free lunch, and whiskey. 
Faith, indeed, 'twas an elegant sight ; 
But the boys, one and all, they got frisky 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
CHORUS. 
Al, but Duffy sold horrible liquor; 
It would knock you up high as a 
kite, 
And the bar I'm sure never looked sicker 
Than on Duffy's grand opening night. 
Poor Duffy sent out invitations, 
And invited his neighbors to come. 
He told them he'd treat them all dacent, 
And give them their fill of good rum. 
They came there in droves and by dozens, 
And got into a 
terrible fight. 
They broke all the doors and the windows 
On Duffy's grand opening night. 
Ah, but Duffy, etc, 
They stole all the stock that he had there, 
And drank all his whiskey so sweet ; 
They took both his clothes and his money, 
And threw him out into the street. 
They scattered his family, and left him 
To roam in a 
terrible plight. 
Poor Duffy now lives on free lunches 
Since he gave the grand opening night. 
Ah, but Duffy, etc.

AN ADDRESS TO AN OLD WOODEN PIPE. 
Sung by M ILES M ORRIS. 
So they say you're a 
villain, old friend, 
That you rob me of sleep and of sense, 
To ruin my strength that you tend, 
And walk off with my hardly earned pence. 
That you lead to late hours and bad ways, 
And encourage a 
taste for strong drink; 
One friend in particular says, 
Without hesitation, you stink I 
That you are not a 
beauty, I 
fear, 
An old blackened tube at the best ; 
Your odor—decidedly queer, 
And you're seldom, it ever, at rest. 
I 
do take a 
glass when I 
smoke, 
Especially after I've dined ; 
And my friends are most welcome to croak, 
If it anyway eases their mind. 
I 
think I 
with safety may state, 
That you have cost me fourpence a 
day 
That I 
sometimes have sat up too late, 
And smoked you whilst losing at play. 
Still those fourpence I 
well can afford, 
They make no great hole in my purse ; 
And I 
really don't think, on my word, 
That the smoke made play any worse. 
Of one thing I'm perfectly sure, 
If my temper should follow my pelf ; 
My friends from bad words are secure, 
For I 
Lake it all out on yourself. 
I 
gnaw at your dirty old stein, 
And I 
shut myself in with a 
cloud„ 
And until I've recovered my phlegm, 
I 
do not emerge from my shroud. 
Yon help me bear sorrow and pain, 
You smooth the rough journey of life ; 
You stand by me in sunshine and rain, 
And you keep me from anger and strife. 
The longest song must have an end, 
Mine has with this simple recipe : 
If you want to keep terms with a 
friend, 
Don't endeavor to put out his pipe.

HE LOST HD.; MONKEY. 
A RECIT-N fION. 
Written by W ASH. FAVOR for FAVOR and SHIELDS. 
As I 
walked down the street, by chance I 
did meet 
A 
man who was riding a 
donkey, 
On his back was a 
card offering a 
reward, 
Which said that he'd lost his monkey. 
Then the crowd, don't you see, gathered round him and 
me, 
And the street then it couldn't be crossed ; 
He pulled out a 
big key, and pointed at me, 
And sez, " There's the monkey that's lost." 
I 
sez, " Get out, you old lump, sure you're off of your 
chump, 
And look out, for I 
give you fair warning." 
So I 
up with me stick, and I 
hit him a 
lick. 
I 
sez, " I 
landed in town this morning 
He threw a 
rope on the fly, and me neck he did tie; 
The end to the gang then he tossed. 
Then he sez in a 
rage, " Haul him into the cage, 
For he is the monkey that's lost." 
So they pulled me along, yes, forty-five strong, 
Till they got me to the door of the jug. 
P. T. Barnum sez," Punk, sure you have the wrong monk," 
As soon as he looked at me mug. 
But he sez, " I'll engage you to sit in a 
cage, 
And say fifty thousand you cost." 
I 
sEz, " Get out, you old bum, Mr. P T. Barnum, 
I'm not the poor monkey you lost."

When singing on the roof at night, 
As happy as can be.

THE DANCING IRISHMAN . 
I'M Pat Molloy, the Irish boy, I'm always funny when full of 
money— 
Pm the boy to take your taste ; 
Come now. my lads, I'm singing right howld and frisky, 
And don't you think that Pat with good sense he is graced ; 
I'd tell you how to sing— tip you all an Irish fling— 
Then hold your tongues to me, for I'm the dancing king. 
C11011.1: S. 
Pll dance in spite of blarney, and I'll shake the heel and toe ; 
I'm happy though I 
warn ye that I'll dance and off I 
go. 
The best of ways in our young days is whiskey tippling, all clear 
and rippling— 
Potheen's the Irish joy ! 
Though drunken men I'm blaming top full of whiskey— 
Now don't think that Pat is still an Irish boy ; 
I'll sing and talk sublime, tip ye, too, the Moore-ish rhyme, 
The lays of Paddy's land, for fin a 
singer grand ! 
I'll dance in spite of blarney, etc. 
The girls I 
love, and they approve of my country system—that's 
when I've kissed them. 
And clasped them to my breast ; 
There's Biddy Lynch O'Leary, she's full of Venus— 
Now don't you think that I 
can find a 
place of rest— 
On my knee she sits and smiles, blushes redder than the tiles, 
But then her khs is sweet— bedad, she thinks me, great. 
I'll dance in spite of blarney, etc. 
When we are wed there'll be a

THE YORKSHIRE FARMER. 
As sung by JAMES TAYLOR, Champion Comique of the world. 
I 
am a 
jolly old farmer man, 
And go by the name of Yorkshire Sam; 
Hale and hearty too, I 
am, 
As you may plainly see. 
I 
remember well when I 
used to prance, 
And join in the merry village dance; 
But I'm not so young as I 
used to be, 
About forty years ago. 
cuoaus 
The boys and girls of the village say, 
Whenever I 
happen to pass that way ; 
There's good old Sam, the farming man, 
Hurray ! hurray ! hurray I 
About forty years ago, M 
V 
boys, 
I 
took myself a 
wife ; 
And she has been a 
boon to me, 
And the comfort of my life. 
/ 
remember well, when she used to say, 
It's a 
pity to let time slip away ; 
But we're not so young as we used to be, 
About forty years ago. 
The boys and girls, &..c.„ 
I 
remember \veil in the harvest time, 
When we used to mow the hay ; 
We used to get our home-brewed ale, 
In the bottle every day. 
Them were the times to enjoy one's self, 
There wasn't so much grinding after pelf ; 
Bat remember I 
am speaking of 
Som forty years ago.
