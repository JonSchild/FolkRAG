INFLUENZA
“Learned it off a holiness boy in Amarillo, Texas.”
In nineteen hundred and twenty-nine, men an' women sure was dyin', From de disease
what de doctors called de flu. People was dyin' ev'ywhere; death was creepin' th'ough de
air, For de groans of de sick sure was sad.
Chorus:
It was God's almighty hand; he was judgin' this old land; North an' South; East an' West
could be seen, Yes, he killed de rich an' poor, an' he's goin' to kill more If you don't turn
away from your sins.
In Memphis, Tennessee, doctors said it soon would be, In a few days influenza will
(we'LL?) control. But God showed that He was head, an' He put de doctor to bed, And the
nurse they broke down with de same.
Chorus:
Influenza is a disease, makes you weak all in your knees; 'Tis a fever ev'ybody sure does
dread; Puts a pain in ev'y bone, a few days an' you are gone To a place in de groun' called
de grave.
Chorus:
