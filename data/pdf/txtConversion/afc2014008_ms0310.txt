raw upon
 
l
arger concepts o
f what public f
olklorists a

The f
i
rst o
f t

hat t
he t
ask f
acing public f
olklorists i
s t
o "
foster
 
commonality and p
lurality s
imultaneously and a
rtfully." "Commonality," one
 
participant a
sserts, "
has i
t
s basis i
n human nature. Multiculturalism, f
or example,
 
i
mplies t
he existence o
f an underlying commonality." Public f
olklorists, another
 
suggests, should  actively seek ways o
f expressing commonalities among d
iverse
 
communities and t
hen a
ttempt t
o p
lace t
hese commonalities i
n a
 b
roader national
 
context (
i
. e
. consider a
 comparative approach i
n p
resenting t

rts). A
ll
 
s
uch f

COMMUNICATION AND LANGUAGE
 
Thinking about c
ategories p
rompted one observation: "Categorization--putting
 
t
hings i
nto boxes--is an i
nevitable part o
f human cognition. We a
re f
oolish t
o
 
oppose i
t
. Humans absolutely r

re even more boxes, a
lternate systems t
hat c
an be p
i
led
 
one on t
he o
ther so t
hat nobody ever gets t
rapped."
 
Seminar participants f
elt t
hat f
olklorists need t
o develop more e
ffective l
anguage
 
and t
erminology f
or communicating with o
ther p
rofessionals--and f
oundations, and
 
o
rganizations--whose i
nterests overlap with t
hose o
f f
olklorists. C
larify t
he
 
l
anguage o
f your mission, t
hey suggest, t
o make i
t
 l
ess politically charged and
 
more understandable (
and acceptable) t
o f

l
lies, e
specially
 
i
n t
he public o
r government s

n some c
ases t

l
anguage and p

f potential supporters. Foundations t

reservation" o
r "

i
mportant social questions."
 
"
Be more accurate with l

Folklorists t
ypically s
ay 'we'
 
and '

re t

KAREN AMSPACHER  [North Carolina] Director of the Core Sound Waterfowl Museum and
 
an active leader in numerous environmental and cultural preservation projects in
 
Carteret County and coastal North Carolina
 
*Locating resources for professional training in preservation work
 
*Balancing grassroots involvement and professional concerns
 
*Convincing  tourism  leaders  that  regional  culture must  be preserved  to
 
maintain the region's attraction for tourists
 
[NOTES:  "Tourism  and  the  development  that  has  followed  are  two  of  the
 
greatest threats facing the cultural heritage of eastern North Carolina.  How to
 
balance  the  local  economy's  need  for  tourist  dollars  without  destroying  the
 
reasons  (
clean environment, unique culture,  lack of development)  people come to
 
this area is one of our area's greatest challenges."]
 
DEBORAH  BOYKIN
 [Mississippi]
 Folk  Arts  Director  of  the  Mississippi  Arts
 
Commission;  works  with  traditional  artists,  traditional  communities,  tribal
 
government,  local  arts  agencies,  festival  presenters,  tourism  agencies,  and
 
schools.
 
*Community participation  (
particularly that of tradition bearers)  in the
 
planning and development of cultural tourism projects
 
*Developing systems that enable tradition bearers to share the control and
 
profit of cultural tourism projects
 
[NOTES:  "The  State  Tourism  Office  is  very  committed  to  promoting  the
 
stretch of  Highway 61  that  runs  from Memphis  to  the Louisiana  line as  `Blues
 
Alley,'  sometimes with more enthusiasm than accuracy."
 
"I am working with the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.
 For the past
 
year, the tribe has operated the only land-based casino in the state.  The casino
 
has brought both economic and cultural changes to the reservation and the tribe
 
is exploring ways to make the one benefit the other.
 For the first time,  the
 
tribe  is  examining  how  to  present  its  culture  and  artistic  traditions  to
 
non-Choctaws and how it wants to develop cultural programs for tribal members."]

Administration Programs  at John C.  Campbell  Folk School;  has worked in public
 
folklore since the early 1970s;  areas  included Ohio,  West Virginia,  Kentucky,
 
Colorado,  and  Iowa;  has  pioneered  the  development  of  five-minute  documentary
 
formats on traditional culture for radio and television; current responsibilities
 
include maintaining a seed bank to sustain regional plant varieties.
 
*Effects of copyright laws and electronic licensing fees on our efforts to
 
document,  present,  and preserve traditional culture
 
[NOTES:  Issues  that  have  come  up  frequently  in  his  work  include  the
 
following:  how public programs such as festivals affect public expectations of
 
various ethnic/cultural groups and their traditions; the impact of our work with
 
traditions  on the  tradition  itself;  how to  encourage  a "sense of place"  that
 
includes  all  of  the  ethnic  groups  that  interact  and  live  in  that  place;  and
 
serving the tourists who visit the Folk School.]
 
VARICK CHITTENDEN  [New York]  Founder and Director of Traditional Arts in Upstate
 
New  York  (TAUNY)  and  Professor  of  English  at  SUNY  College  of  Technology  at
 
Canton;  TAUNY's mission is  to document,  preserve,  and present  the traditional
 
cultures of Upstate New York,  with an emphasis on the 14 county region north of
 
the Mohawk River known as the North Country.
 Recently opened the North Country
 
Folkstore as an outlet for traditional crafts,  recordings, publications,  foods,
 
etc
 
*TAUNY  has  identified masters  of  traditional  quilts,  woven  and braided
 
rugs,
 rustic  and  conventional
 furniture,
 builders  of
 canoes,
 Adirondack
 
guideboats and St. Lawrence skiffs, producers of food items and others who could
 
2
 
teach younger generations to make quality and interesting goods for market.  How
 
do we create an atmosphere that will encourage some  [young]  people to undertake
 
such ventures?  How do we help with the logistics to make such traditional crafts
 
production occur?  How do we market the goods once they are produced? How do we
 
influence public policy makers to create incentives for this kind of economic
 
development?
 How can TAUNY get support for our role in this kind of research,
 
planning and development?
 
[
NOTES:  "TAUNY has recently approached planners of a proposed fresh water
 
aquarium on the St.  Lawrence River to consider a component on river  life and
 
traditions.
 [This  overture  was  not]  received with much enthusiasm.
 In the
 
future,  we would like to be better prepared to be taken more seriously by area
 
agencies. "

ROBERT  (ROBY)  COGSWELL  [Tennessee]  Director of Folk Arts at the Tennessee Arts
 
Commission; a native of Tennessee and has been a state folklorist there for over
 
a decade
 
*What policies should folk arts programs maintain in respect to pan-tribal
 
cultural expressions celebrated within the Indian Pow-Wow movement?  On the one
 
hand, Pow-Wow culture is often the only game in town for general audience public
 
presentation of Native American heritage.  It is the arena with which many ethnic
 
leaders
 and
 artists
 self-associate,
 which
 is
 aggressively  advanced  by
 
multi-tribal  non-profits  (who are  often the only organized arts  constituents
 
among Native Americans),  and one to which non-Indian audiences respond.  On the
 
other hand,  it tends to obscure specific tribal heritages and matters of context
 
and  authenticity  relating  to  them.
 Very  traditional  and  indigenous  tribal
 
artists are usually not part of Pow-Wow presentations, and they are often brought
 
into Pow-Wow contexts only with great difficulty.
 Interpretive dimensions of
 
Pow-Wows are usually superficial,  and they often misrepresent some aspects of
 
Native American culture to non-Indians and younger Indian generations alike.
 
[NOTES:  "In seeking a viable future for our work, we need to realistically
 
address such problems as the academic/public schism and the persisting lack of
 
an effective professional organization it has bequeathed us,  and the long-term
 
monopolization of the field's limited resources by a few centralized programs."
 
"Public folklore has grappled much more dutifully with the core issues of
 
cultural pluralism than have most other circles in the wider `multiculturalism'
 
movement.  . . But the movement's more political agendas of tokenism and turf have
 
presented us with more setbacks than opportunities.  `Minority' arts groups [
have
 
rejected] the public folklore approach to their traditions on the assumption that
 
it is antithetical to the process of cultural self-presentation."
 
"Attending the South Carolina Sweetgrass Basketmakers Conference was my
 
introduction to the idea [
circulating] among environmentalists that craftspeople
 
who  now  need  better  access  to  essential  traditional  materials  represent  an
 
environmental threat."
 
"As  sporadic ex-officio consultant and friendly critic to the Tennessee
 
pilot projects in the National Trust for Historic Preservation's Heritage Tourism
 
Initiative over the past four years . . . I was struck by how oblivious the Trust
 
and its consultants remained to folklife concerns. "

[
NOTES:  "No infrastructure for the support of folk and traditional arts
 
exists at the state level and there are only four traditional arts programs at
 
local  arts  agencies.  . . . I am  involved  in documenting  and presenting  the
 
African-American working community of West Oakland,  implementing a memorial at
 
the new C.  L.  Dellums Amtrak train station in Oakland's Jack London Square--a
 
project that involves the greater Bay Area African-American community, historic
 
preservationists, Labor Union Members, and Railroad historians, editing a booklet

KATHLEEN  CONDON  [
New  York]  Community  Project  Coordinator/Developer  at  the
 
Brooklyn Children's Museum since 1994; former Curator of Folklife and Community
 
Outreach,  and Adult Programs Coordinator,  at South Street Seaport Museum,  and
 
staff folklorist at the Brooklyn Arts Council.
 
*At this seminar, I am interested in finding ways in which folklorists can:
 
(
1) break out of a "United Nations" approach to multicultural presentation
 
and instead strive to facilitate compelling programs which allow cross-cultural
 
audiences  to think about  common human experiences  from a variety of cultural
 
perspectives.
 Not  always,  but  too  often,  I find  that  audiences  (
not  the
 
cognoscenti,  but average audiences)  are predominantly interested in folk arts
 
programming  involving their own cultures/communities,  and grow  impatient  and
 
bored--even enraged--if other cultures and not their own are represented in a
 
program/exhibit.
 Perhaps  this  just  reflects  human  nature--adult  education
 
specialists tell us that adults generally only want to know more about the things
 
they already know about or can use in some way.  Yet,  I still think we can create
 
better models  to help audiences move beyond this disinterest and recognize a
 
compelling expression of the human spirit, a spirit similar to but different from
 
their own,  in culturally diverse programming.  I think public sector folklorists
 
have taken too much for granted that people will have this experience as a result
 
of the programs we produce.
 
(
2) move towards presenting traditional arts and artists as they exist in
 
the context  of modern  lives,  and move away from a decontextualized approach,
 
which deals  only with folk-arts-relevant aspects  of an artist's  life and can
 
create  new  stereotypes  while  it  dispels  old  ones.
 How  can  we  reframe  our
 
identities as public sector folklorists  in a way that will make this kind of
 
broader work possible and still retain our funding base?
 
[NOTES:  "For the last year I have coordinated an institution-wide team of
 
professionals at the Brooklyn Children's Museum.
 Our mandate is to develop a
 
major exhibition and related programs to help children understand `community'  in
 
their lives and the lives of those around them.
 It was not until after I had
 
started  this  job  that  I realized  the  enormity  of  the  task  I had  agreed  to
 
undertake  and the  lack of models  I could fall back on,  in folklore or other
 
related fields,  for guidance.
 I
' ve been re-thinking the way  [
we folklorists]
 
represent community culture to the public and I am finding our methods lacking
 
in sophistication.  . . .
 Our team has decided that we will not employ traditional
 
methods of representing diverse but parallel communities  . . . but instead will
 
focus on one particular, relatively concrete, observable activity associated with
 
communities--gathering.
 I would really like to get some feedback  . . . on the
 
concept,  and hear new ideas which would make me consider it differently."]
 
JI
IDY FLORES  [Guam]  Public sector folklorist for the Guam Council on the Arts &
 
Humanities  Agency;  duties  include  archiving,  documenting,
 showcasing,  and
 
encouraging the continued practice of the indigenous Chamorro traditions as well
 
as those of other ethnic groups on Guam.
 
[NOTES:  "The new director of our state arts agency has  stated that her
 
mission is to make  [
the Guam]  CAHA self-sustaining through  `cultural tourism'
 
within the next five years.
 She is focusing on the promotion and marketing of
 
Chamorro culture as a way to educate the tourists who visit Guam and also as a
 
way to pay the expenses of a large new gallery through percentage of sales and
 
entrance fees to the gallery.  . . I hope to be able to provide the expertise to
 
balance cultural authenticity with marketing, and to consider the sensitivities
 
and needs of our traditional artists within this marketing context."
 
NOTES  on  a possible  case  study:  "We  were  awarded  a grant  from  NEA
 
Underserved Communities in 1991 to begin planning for a cultural village to be
 
located  in  the  300-year-old  village  of  Inarajan.
 Although  the  project  was
 
initiated by our agency, the proposal included a plan for the formation of a non-
profit corporation made up of residents who would take over full administration
 
of the project by the end of three years.  . . . We are now in our third year of
 
f
 
4
 
operation.
 Revenues from entrance fees and crafts sales now fund approximately
 
one-half of the  [
approx.  $300,000]  operational costs.
 Visitor numbers did not
 
increase as rapidly as expected because of natural disasters which occurred in
 
Guam  (
five  typhoons  in  1992  and an  8.2  earthquake  in  1993)  and  the economic
 
recession in Japan, our main tourism base.  An appropriation from the Government
 
of  Guam and  careful  budgeting by  the  general  manager  have  allowed  continued
 
operations.
 We are now working on several ideas for continued existence. ,

[NOTES:  "Working for a state-based humanities council,  . . . I encounter
 
reservations--voiced by members of my board and other `
traditional humanists'--
about  folklore  and how it  is  sometimes perceived in the competitive world of

*Cultural Heritage Tourism is recognized and embraced by many businesses
 
and  tourist  offices.
 I watch  amazed  as  new  strategies  and  itineraries  are
 
produced without consideration of quality or authenticity of location or events.
 
Unfortunately,  mythical  history,  ethnic  and  regional  stereotypes  and  faux
 
heritage  attract  large  audiences.
 Can  I develop  a method  of  directing  the
 
entities involved to look towards presenting traditional culture rather than the
 
Disney version?
 
[
NOTES on a possible case study:  "San Pete County w
ill be the focus of a
 
yearlong project through the state Travel Council to develop its cultural tourism
 
market.  Historically San Pete was settled by Scandinavian converts to the Mormon
 
Church.
 Today few traditions of this heritage remain,  but  in an effort to be
 
special,  different and ethnic  (and therefore attractive to tourists)  residents
 
tout themselves as Scandinavian.
 For example,  there is an annual Scandinavian
 
festival  which  is  really  a  local  arts  & crafts  festival  and  has  little
 
Scandinavian influence.
 
"It has been problematic for the [Utah] Folk Arts Program to respond to San
 
Pete's inquiries regarding funding and to assist them in reviving traditions they
 
are  interested  in presenting.
 Since our primary focus  has been to work with
 
artists who hail from communities  in which the traditions have continued over
 
generations,  our office has remained distant from the activities  in San Pete.
 
Now that there will be more development of heritage tourism initiatives for the
 
San Pete County region,  our office is slowly being convinced that we would like
 
to assist in issues of authenticity and appropriate presentation of their local
 
cultural  heritage.
 We will  [
conduct  fieldwork]  to  locate  local  folk artists
 
(
though  unlikely  Scandinavian)  who  might  become  part  of  San  Pete's  future
 
programming. "

*Strategies  for  the  maintenance  of  Folk  Arts  Programming  in  light  of
 
serious budget cuts and restructuring of public arts funding agencies
 
*Who are our constituents--artists,  communities,  the general public?  How
 
can  we  make  a bigger  impact  on  the  arts  scene?
 What  kind  of  training  and
 
approaches do we need to accomplish this?
 
[
NOTES:  "Folk Arts programs across the nation have been mined for images
 
and vignettes for use in the fight to maintain federal,  state and local funding
 
5
 
of the arts.
 Yet many of the communities we serve are considered marginal at
 
best.  Concepts of pluralism and multiculturalism have had tremendous  PR value
 
while the support of truly innovative and expansive programming has been minimal.
 
Working with Southeast Asian communities,  I am very aware of their invisibility
 
to most public arts administrators.
 This has encouraged me to think about how
 
"marginal"  communities  become  constituents  to  arts  agencies  and  what  the
 
responsibilities of arts professionals are to communities outside the mainstream.
 
"What kind of models can the field of folklore provide the arts community,
 
politicians and the general public for understanding the contour and textures of
 
our pluralistic society?  Can we look at this crisis as an opportunity to place
 
ourselves within the dialogue currently fueled by thinkers who seek to restrict
 
our  definitions  of  American  culture  and  solidify  the  boundaries  that  have
 
historically separated us?  These issues are central to the future of our field
 
and the shape it will take in the next several decades.
 
"What are the lessons  learned about the impact of our work?
 How can we
 
utilize this information to direct our field forward, to increase our impact and
 
visibility?  How can our accomplishments be packaged and marketed to create new
 
positions  and  sources  of  funding  and  to  expand  the  opportunities  for  the
 
involvement  of  folklorists  in  community  development,  historic  preservation,
 
cultural conservation and other projects and programs?"]

American  Folklife,  been  an  Arts  Administration  Fellow  at  the  NEA  Folk  &

[
NOTES:  "Running  a state  level  program  poses  a range  of  challenges,
 
including the stress and professional isolation of being a folklife staff of one
 
rather than part of a larger organization whose mission is dedicated to folklife
 
programming and research.
 
"The  state  budget  provides  my  salary  and benefits,  but  no  programming
 
funds.
 Luckily  I inherited three  good,  grant-funded projects.
 The  lack  of
 
programming funds, coupled with the adversely changing national climate for grant
 
funds, has made me acutely aware of the need to build private sector support for
 
folklife programs.
 
"This  summer  I will  be  conducting  the  first  extensive  field  survey of
 
Montana folk art undertaken in sixteen years.  Montana is an incredibly diverse
 
state, yet `cowboys and Indians'  are the most widely recognized cultural groups.
 
During the recent legislative session, most bills that sought to acknowledge and
 
support the state's cultural pluralism were defeated.  There is a strong feeling
 
at  the  state  level
 . that  funding  the  arts  and  humanities  . . . is
 
unnecessary at best and evil at worst.
 Yet there are members of over 30 ethnic
 
groups within our borders,  some with a legacy of five generations.
 
"Individualism,  coupled  with  Westerners'  strong  ties  to  land,  have  a
 
forceful  effect  on  the  interaction  of  culture  and  the  environment.
 The
 
controversies surrounding use of Indian sacred space for secular use and economic
 
profit are on-going.  Other conflicts arise from man's agricultural, domestic and
 
recreational needs for water and the ecosystem's need for constancy in rivers,
 
lakes,  and wetlands to support habitats.
 
On  an  economic  development  project  with  the  Blackfeet  Nation  in
 
northwestern Montana:
 "The reservation serves as the eastern gateway to Glacier
 
National Park, thus thousands of tourists come through the main reservation town
 
each  year.
 The  boom  in  interest  surrounding  western  culture  and  art  has
 
increased the sale of indian art as well.  Unfortunately there is only one main
 
venue for Indian art in [
town].  Those tourists who locate it are often unwilling
 
to pay reasonable prices for such high quality and labor intensive traditional
 
art as beadwork,  not to mention contemporary Indian art works such as painting
 
and sculpture. "

RITA MOONSAMMY  [

administration of grants, development of cosponsored projects, consultation with
 
6
 
local state, and national organizations and agencies, research and documentation,
 
and production of special projects regarding folk culture  (
publications,  films,
 
exhibits,  etc.)
 
[NOTES:  "For  the  last  eighteen months,  I have been deeply  involved  in
 
building what we at the NJ State Council on the Arts are calling a `
statewide
 
infrastructure for folk arts programming.'
 We are working with a variety of
 
organizations and individuals to develop programs around the state to support
 
folk arts and traditional culture.
 In a state such as ours,  which ranks with
 
California,  New  York,
 Florida,
 and  Texas  in  percentages  of  foreign-born
 
residents;  which has the second highest per capita  income  in the nation;  yet
 
where,  in some cities, more than 60% of residents are on welfare; where  New York
 
City effectively spills over a fourth of our state; yet agriculture is still an
 
important  part  of  the  economy;  finding  appropriate  and  sustainable  ways  to
 
support folk arts programming is a daily and long range challenge.  . . . I began
 
to  think  long  ago  about  the place  of  folk  culture  in  the  broad  spectrum of
 
individual, community, and civic life; how public folklorists can articulate the
 
complexity and  connections  of  that  array,  and,  more  importantly,  how we  can
 
assist in creating cultural policies that reflect it.
 
" I am especially interested now in seeing our field contribute more  [
to
 
public debate on educational,  social,  and cultural policies."]

[NOTES:  "I am concerned with the treatment of Native American culture, and
 
communities, and how traditional knowledge and information from those communities
 
is  gathered  and  presented.
 I am  also  concerned  with  the  roles  of  Native
 
Americans in the [definition and development] of program concepts.  My experience
 
has been that museum work and folk arts programming are largely Anglo-dominated
 
fields.
 The perceptions  created by these controls  are detrimental  to Native
 
peoples,  and ultimately to our nation in its  efforts to preserve and present
 
Native American traditions and cultures.
 I have a great  concern that Native
 
people don't have access to learning the basic processes by which their history,
 
culture,  and arts are presented and interpreted by non-Natives.
 
"In  the  larger picture,  I am  interested  in  strategies  that  impact  the
 
continuity of traditional arts programming,  and as a result,  traditional arts
 
themselves.  How do we maintain the organizational foundations and funding bases
 
that support folk arts programming?  What advocacy and coalition building will
 
be required to maintain and expand the place that folk arts have in America's
 
consciousness?
 How can we educate our communities,  legislators,  and funding
 
sources about the important role that folk arts play in the collective framework
 
of American society?"]

[NOTES:  "[My work gave me]  the opportunity to assist my Indochina refugee
 
countrymen from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.  Among my countrymen were the finest
 
artists from their homelands,  such as musicians, dancers, weavers and many other
 
traditional  craftsmen  and  women.
 These  artists  were  faced  with  political
 
persecution in their homelands and they soon realized that there was no future
 
in continuing their tradition,  which was marked by the new regime as "the arts,
 
the music and dance of the aristocracy.

collection,  plans and implements folklife and social history exhibits.
 
[
NOTES:  "Issues  such as  plurality,  representation,  and the politics  of
 
culture permeate our attempts to involve traditional artists and practitioners
 
in public presentation.  I am often called upon . . . to provide explanations and
 
interpretations of community-based traditions and events.
 This  is especially
 
true in the realm of ethnicity.  My own research experience with recent refugee
 
and immigrant groups has allowed me to organize and participate in many programs
 
and  publications  that  address  the  needs  of  these  recent  arrivals  in  North
 
Carolina.
 
"The issues of plurality are particularly relevant to my current project,
 
a museum exhibit  that  examines  the plurality of health care  systems  in North
 
Carolina.
 
"Cultural tourism in North Carolina is a growing industry, and those of us
 
who  work  in  public  folklore  need  to  be  conversant  in  the  concepts  and
 
implications of this phenomenon.  We need to be able to offer cogent analyses and

*One of our greatest strengths is cultural sensitivity.
 As folklorists,
 
we should be part of the teams that are creating--not just implementing--public
 
policy, based on our in-depth knowledge of cultural traditions.  We are cultural
 
specialists  who  can help policy makers  think  about  the best  ways  to  address
 
social  ills,  often based on successful  artistic models  developed from within
 
communities  themselves.
 We're  not  hidden  in  the  academy;  we're  out  in
 
communities where,  for instance,  our work with recent immigrants holds keys to
 
developing meaningful and affirmative programs for them and for society at large.
 
The questions:
 How can we market our strengths?  What are some strategies for
 
making alliances with policy makers--both in the public and private sectors--to
 
ensure that we are invited to become part of policy making decisions?
 
[
NOTES:  "I  seem  to  be  working  increasingly  with  aspects  of  cultural
 
revivals--from music  of  the  1960s,  with Armenian objects  and  ideas  from the
 
current Armenia Cultural Project of Country Roads,  and in the City of Lowell as
 
it transforms itself from an industrial mecca to a postindustrial microcosm of
 
the New America--all of which fall under the greater mandate of maintaining, and

I imagine that  I may be caught  in the crossfire between these groups.
 How as
 
folklorists do we encourage the preservation of traditional cultures and at the
 
same time acknowledge the ways in which these cultures often (

contribute to the decline  of  such resources?
 How can we  encourage discourse

 thesis/introduction
 to

 I  considered
 the
 effect
 of
 
deindustrialization on one community and one worker.
 Defined as the systematic
 
decline of our  industrial base,  deindustrialization usually involves  "capital
 
flight."
 Industries  are  closed  down  in  one  region  and  often  moved  to
 
another--across states and across the globe.
 communities such as Belfast Maine
 
(where  Penobscot  was  located),  often look to tourism as  their panacea.
 This
 
trend has significant and complex implications for our field.
 In a time of such
 
radical  economic  change,  how  do  communities  like  Belfast  sustain  themselves
 
economically?  What role does tourism play in such circumstances?  How are local
 
traditions altered by such economic shifts?  And what does this mean for our work

*How  do  we  better  articulate  ourselves  to  other  disciplines  without
 
alienating others by our commitment which can make us sound elitist?  This has
 
to do with better expressing the relevance of our work.
 
[
NOTES:  "One  of  the  key  issues  I grapple  with  in  this  heritage  parks
 
program is that of the cultural impact of heritage tourism on local traditional
 
ways  of  life.
 To  this  end,  I am  constantly  fighting  the  upward  battle  of
 
ensuring the integration of community-based concerns and recommendations into the
 
planning process.
 This  also  involves  ensuring appropriate  representation of
 
local traditional cultures in the implementation process.
 
"Most recently, the Pennsylvania Heritage Affairs Commission has become the
 
new home  for the State Office of Refugee and Immigration Programs.
 This has
 
allowed for a direct link between my Office of Folklife Programs and the efforts
 
made  to  assist  refugees  in  their  resettlement  process.
 The  Commission  is
 
particularly  concerned  that  cultural  sensitivity be  foremost  in  all  refugee
 
programs.
 As a first-time effort,  our two offices are coordinating a regional
 
conference  on  the  role  that  the  traditional  arts  can  play  in  a  refugee
 
community's stability.  Issues of inter-ethnic relations, intra-ethnic relations,
 
economic  and  political  equity,  the  conservation  of  cultural  and  artistic
 
traditions,  and cross-cultural education, will be of primary concern to me as I
 
develop this new program. "

heritage days,  celebrations of ethnic pride,  exhibitions of regional arts and

 While many of these events are organized or sponsored
 
by non-profit organizations,  and are intended to be educational,  the marketing
 
of traditional art forms--including dance, music, foodways, and folk crafts--has
 
also become big business.
 
"What are the roles of the folklorist in the marketing of tradition?

Dear Bess,
 
You were very kind and generous to write that wonderful  letter.
 
Dan and  I both enjoyed hearing from you and we deeply appreciate
 
your  thoughtfulness.
 You were absolutely right about our
 
partnership.
 Dan has been very supportive from the beginning.
 
We both felt happy--privileged even--to do some of the
 
development and organizational work for  the meeting.
 
That,  by  i
tself,  has had some positive  local  spin-offs.
 Our
 
l
ittle group of colleagues  (scattered through the arts council,
 
university,  and museum of history) has strengthened  its working
 
relationship.
 We have our difficult moments,  as you know,  but
 
our negotiation skills are growing.
 This project has also raised
 
the Folklife Section's stock within the NC Arts Council.
 Mary's
 
participation--and pleasure--was an  indication of that.
 And it
 
has pushed me to think more deeply about where  I can make some
 
contributions  to the field.
 
You,  however,  are the guiding spirit of  these endeavors.
 The
 
conference itself was your  idea.
 You gave wise counsel  to us
 
over many months.
 Your opening presentation set  just  the right
 
tone for  the meeting and got us off to a good start.
 A number of
 
people have commented on how fortunate they felt  to spend this
 
time with you and how much they had benefited from your
 
insightful  and thought-provoking remarks.
 Without your vision
 
and labor,  this  field would not have developed as  it has and most
 
of us would not have the  jobs we have.
 
Certainly this meeting could not have happened without you and we
 
will  all  appreciate any  ideas you have about how to build on  i
t.
 
Thanks for sen ding copies of your notes.
 I have  incorporated
 
some of your points  into the enclosed  l
ist of comments and
 
suggestions  from my own notes and from others  I received.
 I
 
faxed a copy to Dan and Barry  late yesterday  (Friday) afternoon
 
but have not circulated  it further.
 Most of our  local  folks are
 
on vacation now.
 
We are  l
ikely to have some money  left over  from the grant.
 It
 
could be around $7,000.
 I am still  paying bills and will  not
 
know the actual  amount until  our various accounts are settled--by
 
the end of next week,  I hope.
 Dan and Barry will  probably have
 
ideas and we could all  brainstorm a l
ittle about possibilities  if
 
you  l
ike.
 Thanks heaps.

(
ii)  Economic: 
to  develop  a viable  industry  which  provides  secure
 
livelihood,
 efficient  returns
 on  investment,
 and
 
equitable distribution of costs and benefits.
 
(
iii) Social: 
to link local needs and tourist demands by providing
 
opportunities and experiences that are compatible with
 
community structure, lifestyle and values but which also
 
meet visitor expectations.

.4."  princivles: 
Several principles of sustainable tourism are outlined in the
 
statement  prepared by  Canadian  specialists  for  Globe  90.
 
-These were presented at the Valletta workshop (
see attachment)
 
and provide a point of departure for elaborating additional
 
perspectives:
 
(
i)
 sustainable t
ourism is a "niche function" of landscape
 
system;  it i
s adjusted to and gives visual expression
 
to the regional human ecological balance;
 
(
ii)
 sustainable t
ourism involves promoting appropriate uses
 
and activities that draw from and reinforce land-scape
 
character, s
ense of place community identity and site
 
opportunity;
 
(iii) sustainable tourism must be given policy definition and
 
direction for each country, region and locality in the
 
light of environmental, social and economic conditions
 
and requirements;
 
(
iv)
 sustainable
 tourism
 requires
 the
 placing
 of
 
delimitations on the forms and pattern of growth but
 
does not preclude new facilities and experiences;
 
(v)
 sustainable  t
ourism  involves:
 thinking  globally,
 
planning strategically  and acting  locally;  promoting
 
working partnerships among the network of actors and
 
constituencies  of  interest;  and  linking  scientific
 
research  and  public  consultation  to  the  needs  of
 
decision making;
 
(vi)
 sustainable t
ourism,  in the  final  analysis,  involves
 
making hard choices based on political trade-offs among
 
and accommodation of social, economic and environmental
 
criteria in the more extended time and space context
 
than that t
raditionally entertained in decision-making.

.5
 Ways'and Means
  
The achievement of the goals and principles of sustainable
 
tourism requires an integrated and interactive approach to
 
development planning and management.  Key instruments include:
 
(
i)
 policy direction and coordination within and between the
 
public, private and community sectors;
 
(
ii)
 strategic planning, based on natural and touristic units
 
and aimed at regional allocation, and balancing supply
 
and demand;
 
(iii) development a
ssessment, monitoring and audit to maintain
 
quality  control,
 improve  opportunity  and  upgrade
 
professional capabilities;
 
(
iv)  all of which must be backed and supported by better
 
information and education programmes that are explicitly
 
geared to problem solving.
 
These processes require, inter alia, the establishment of:
 
(i)
 thresholds and standards,  based on environmental and
 
community indicators of stress and problems;
 
(
ii)
 institutional arrangements that promote accountability,
 
dispute settlement and adaptive decision-making;
 
(
iii) marketing  and  interpretation  that  helps
 to  link
 
opportunity and demand,  f
osters appropriate touristic
 
experiences, and promotes responsible behaviour on the
 
part of the industry and the user; and
 
(
iv)
 training and education f
or all of those involved in the
 
delivery  of  tourist  s
ervices,
 from  multi-national
 
organizations t
o one-person enterprises.

UNC CONFERNCE
 JULY 1995
 
SOME 
•
 PROGRAM PRINCIPLES
 
GIVENS
 
1
) That FA are to be defined in an intellectually
 
acceptable and defensible manner.
 
2
) That FA at their best are as worthy of widespread
 
respect and support as any culture's fine or popular arts at
 
their best.
 
3
)  That artistic quality,  no matter how slippery the
 
term, is a first essential.
 
4
)  That traditional artists are the producers and their
 
welfare primary.
 
5
)  That trivialization must be resisted at all costs.
 
6
)  That FA originate and are nurtured locally,  though
 
they may circulate regionally or nationally.
 
7
)  That the oldest artistic traditions have proven their
 
cultural weight and significance by virtue of long-term
 
survival.  They are key.
 
7
) That this is an action program within an action
 
agency.  Lacking strong institutions,  we will fund projects.
 
8
) 
That we must work fast.  By anybody's definition,
 
folk arts express the have-nots,  rarely a popular point of
 
view for long.
 
1
) Primary culture be arers  are  al wa ys of primary
 
importance;  younger learners are of secondary importance;
 
outside learners are of tertiary importance,  even though the
 
latter 
• ma y  perfor m  vit al  roles.
 
2
)  The needs/interests of traditional artists always
 
come before the needs/interests of scholars,  though often
 
ways can and should be found to make them concurrent.
 
3
) The funding of second-rate,  enfeebled or moribund
 
art should be discouraged.  even if of historical interest.

)
 FA should not be discussed in humorous or pathetic
 
contexts but in ordinary language,  using as few specialized
 
academic or bureaucratic terms as reasonable.
 
6
)
 Production standards should be of the highest,  using
 
standards appropriate to the product envisioned and to local
 
custom.
 
7
)  The above given and derived principles stem from and
 
apply to the federal FA program. Anyone else is welcome to
 
adopt and use them.
 
STRATEGIES
 
1
)
 The task of helping local cultures thrive is
 
extremely complex.All possible resources should be used to
 
help,  crossing disciplinary,  institutional,  and fiscal lines
 
freely.  Overall,  academic folkloric,  ethnomusicological,  or
 
cultural anthropological training has proved to be most
 
helpful-Combining such persons with local community experts
 
is perhaps ideal.
 
2
)
 Local cultural patterns are building blocks.  The re-
enforcing or the resumption of special activities like
 
seasonal or annual celebrations in which traditional arts are
 
ordinarily practiced,  is often especially effective and
 
joyful.  Once the desirability of such events has been
 
demonstrated,  their support can be minimal and local.
 
3
)  Sharing with traditional communities the kind of
 
information available to outsiders

4
)  FA has a primary interest in the older traditional
 
practices,  repertoires,  and performers.  This can generally be
 
made evident without excluding the contemporary.  thereby
 
helping fill in current disjunctions in traditional
 
transmission
 
5
)  Where there is a critical mass of tradition bearers
 
practicing the same art  (
e.g. Maine Native basket makers;
 
North Carolina Potters; Missouri fiddlers) working towards
 
culturally appropriate joint actions could be considered:
 
delegations,  conferences,  resolutions,  organizations,
 
projects.
 
6
)
 In complex societies,  outside validation may have
 
great power.  National visibility through NEA Heritage or the
 
Smithsonian Folklife Festival has resulted in local
 
empowerment of formerly declining traditions; the same effect
 
can energize a state or locality.
 
7
)
 Placing the traditional ar ts in to venues
 other
 than
 
"artistic" -- educational,  recreational,  political,
 
commercial -- can help widen support networks and stimulate
 
additional funds and manpower  (
to be cancelled,  of course,  if
 
there is evidence of exploitation or interference with
 
community aesthetic standards.)
 
8
)
 Documentation projects must be based in reality.
 
Who might want to see/hear this when?
 Different projects
 
attract different audiences in both size and composition,  and
 
require varying types and amounts of funding.
 
PRACTICAL POLITICAL POINTS
 
1
)  The perceptions of the local folklorist and of the
 
local politician may coincide in whole or in part. Politics
 
are not necessarily venal,  and politicians stay in office in
 
part because of their sensitivity to community values and
 
needs. A positive approach may uncover possibilities for
 
useful temporary collaborations with known trogdolytes.The
 
point is to get the job done.
 
2
)
 Academic definitions may not coincide with the
 
mandates of political units. Public folklorists must be
 
prepared to curtail or stretch their definitions to suit the
 
purposes of their host agency. As long as soul of the
 
definition itself remains intact,  its particular range of
 
application should present only minimum difficulty.
 
3
)  Apprenticeship programs tend to spread the action
 
out to less easily served though often politically critical
 
regions.  They also give clear public demonstrations of the
 
purposes behind
 folk arts programming.  Though an
 
apprenticeship program demands much staff time,  it is an
 
extremely strong political move.
 
4 ) Behind every program or project,  the unceasing
 
question should be:  is this a local,  regional,  or federal-
sized problem?
 Never lose sight of this.
 
5
)  Get ready for a long haul or rather, many short
 
hauls.  The best results occur almost serendipitously after or
 
during a series of projects.
 
6
)  If there is a strong competent excited person in your
 
area,  shift the program around to get her/him support for
 
his/her great idea.  There's got to be some passion in here
 
somewhere,  and this is often where it shows up.
 
7
)  Ultimately,  every local,  regional,  state,  or federal
 
program must be carefully cobbled to fit current
 
circumstances.  Poliics,  they say , is the art of the
 
possible.
 
MANAGEMENT CONCERNS AND STRATEGIES
 
1
)  A maximum effort should be mounted to prevent
 
projects  from being designed solely to obtain funding.  Avoid
 
professional grants writers.  Discourage attempts to alter
 
projects to please funders.
 
2
)
 Serious attention should be paid to applicants'
 
budgeting and matching concerns,  especially soft match.  Many
 
folk arts applicants have little idea of the dollar value of
 
their contributions of labor,  space,  and equipment.  In a
 
mercantile economy,  the budget conversation can be of major
 
educational value.
 
3
)  Public programs should continuously monitor the
 
availability of private,  federal,  state and local funding.
 
allowing them to emphasize worthy projects and programs least
 
likely to be funded elsewhere.
 
FOLK ARTS PROGRAM SUCCESSES
 
1
)
 The
 Heritage Program has been and is startlingly
 
effective.  It has a happy cultural fit with the American
 
interest in stardom while echoing the siren somg of the
 
lotteries -- maybe next time it will be our turn.  It shows
 
that everyday
 people can produce real art,  and that strange
 
and exotic peoples
 can too.  It ties small scattered
 
localities to the big powerful center,  to the advantage of
 
both.  It emphasizes some of the best bits of the American
 
ethos -- egalitarianism,  generosity,  tolerance,
 and
 
hopefulness.  It  is self-explanatory.  Everybody likes it.  It's
 
quite a phenomenon.
 
2
)
 Professionalism has greatly increased amongst many
 
artists in the performing and crafts worlds.  It has been
 
especially gratifying to see the growth of traditioal
 
artists'  associations,  well informed and nervy enough,  for
 
instance,  to compete successfully along with other artists
 
for emergency hurricane damage funds.(South Carolina Basket
 
Makers Association)
 
3
)  Though most arts professionals don't really know what
 
folk arts are,  nowadays they consider them a part,  sometimes
 
even a necessary part of the scene.  Local presenters
 
scheduling their seasons consider the availability of cowboy
 
poets,  Cambodian dance ensembles and blues singers along with
 
modern dance companies and string quartets.  This is new.
 
4
)
 Professionally staffed local,  state,  and/or regional
 
public folklore programs have overall proved to be efficient,
 
productive,.and popular.  Ultimately a nation-wide network of
 
local-state-regional folk arts experts may come to be the
 
accepted minimum for the public welfare.
 
WHERE WE WENT WRONG?
 
1
)  The public is not yet persuaded to view tradition as
 
on-going and constructive. Most people still think of it as
 
immobile -- archaic and quaintly loveable,  or moribund and
 
cruelly restrictive. And let's not get into the word "folk";
 
somehow we have never spoken broadly and comprehensibly about
 
this most human of concerns.  It is a true failure.
 
2
)  Even though essential at the beginning and still,
 
according to traditional artists,  vital,  the program's
 
emphasis on authenticity has seriously alienated the un-
authentic. Many secondary learners should be and are movers
 
and shakers in the field,  but overall we have failed to
 
engage their enthusiasm and energies
 
3
)  The relative status of the arts of the world --
whose art is more important than whose? -- is unchanged. As
 
of 7/95,  our national answer is,  as it always was: the arts
 
of European high-culture elitists,  including even the often
 
politically damaging avant-garde and protest forms.
 
Will this ever change? It seems unlikely.  The on-
going aesthetic contest between the haves and the have-nots
 
has resulted in extraordinarily evocative and adventurous
 
artistic eruptions,  along with a pattern of frequent co-
option of the creative desperation of the have-nots.  It has
 
also resulted in almost all of the serious money going to the
 
already moneyed.
 
4
)  Though FA avoided NEH-type "pure" research grants,  it
 
encouraged scholarly input to traditional pursuits.  The proof
 
of these puddings came to be some kind of informational
 
product -- tape,  pamphlet,  film -- came to be essential for
 
FA support.At the same time,  many public sector folklorists
 
reluctantly minimized or even abandoned serious exploratory
 
field work,  lacking the time,  the driving curiosity and the
 
professional incentives essential for such hard-slogging and
 
often unrewarding activity.
 
Thus,  meager information about available traditional
 
resources combined with FA's insistence on finished products
 
resulted in a plethora of events dependent upon way too much
 
Rolodex  (previously known)  field work and way too little
 
ground-breaking.  Our policies actually worked against our
 
principles.
 
5
)  A new job category of public folklorist was created,
 
without any clear vision of its functions. No-one could
 
possibly perform all the tasks outlined in the average public
 
folklore job description.  The needs,  concerns,  liabilities,
 
agonies,  long-term perspectives and short-term thrills of
 
public folklorists are still unclear.  Their stories may well
 
outline a part of our general future.

PROBLEM AREAS FOR DISCUSSION
 
1
)  How can folklorists better explain what we're about? This
  
is critical.
 
2
)  What other parts of the society -- economic,  educational,
 
religious,  political -- can we collaborate with to our
 
advantage and how can we better fit in?
 
3
)  Which is the better overall strategy -- to scatter
 
strengths and resources  (for example,  into many diffewrent
 
governmental programs)  or to try to keep them intact? The
 
former is safer,  the latter is stronger.  This problem comes
 
up in many contexts.
 
4
)  A serious analysis of the effects of current technology
 
upon traditional life-styles must be initiated.  Perhaps this
 
is the occasion? It shouldn't all be negative or positive
 
either.
