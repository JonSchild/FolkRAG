Interview Index 
00:00:00 -- Introductory Slate // Interview Lede 
00:1:15-- Early Life & Contexts 
●
Born in Logan, Ohio on Fourth of July, 1994 to mom Christine (24, at the time)
●
Grew up in a variety of unique houses and living situations -- from an “abandoned church” to 
a home-built cabin, between Athens County, Cleveland and Columbus
●
Parents met at Casa Nueva, a worker-owned co-operative Mexican restaurant in Athens, 
Ohio
●
Parents originally came to Athens, Ohio to attend Ohio University from Columbus (dad) and 
Cleveland/Mentor (mom), to study art/art history
●
Introverted in early childhood; interested in art and “playing kitchen”; and then, eventually, 
in sports
●
Parents split up when Adele was around 2pm; Adele & Christine moved in with a series of 
boyfriends in Athens/the Plains, then moved to Columbus (~ :00:07:12) and lived in Victorian 
Village; the back to Athens when her little sister was born (~00:08:09); then to Mentor, 
outside of Cleveland (~ 00:09:47) where her mom worked for the Cleveland VA; then to 
Cleveland Heights, where mom purchased a house (~ 00:10:50), then back to Athens, where 
her mom hand-built a cabin for them on a boyfriend’s property in New Marshﬁeld (~ 
00:12:30); dad and new wife, meanwhile, lived in Old North Columbus, and then in Meigs 
County, Ohio (~ 00:13:40), where Adele was brieﬂy sent to live (00:15:13); and then, “in town” 
Athens (00:17:00)
00:18:00 -- Early Interests & Hobbies 
●
Interested in “being an adult” from an early age; rebelled against her mom’s alternative rural 
lifestyle (more interested, early on, in shopping and going to Columbus, “hot running water,” 
etc.)
●
Played sports (many sports) throughout high school; had a steady boyfriend and group of 
friends
●
Started working at 13; at the Village Bakery in Athens, Ohio
00:21:18 -- First Kitchen Job: Village Bakery in Athens // Culture at the Village Bakery 
●
Culture at the Village Bakery -- encouraging employees to launch businesses
●
Started working these doing dishes; mom had started working there
●
Childhood kitchen/cooking experiences -- eggrolls!// Home foodways experiences -- set of 
standard meals, and then grazing; “cooking was never a huge part of my life”
●
Village Bakery job as something that introduced “discipline” (00:24:51) -- had to be there on 
the weekends, at a certain time; wanted to gain the respect of the co-workers who counted 
on here: “ … really put me in an environment where I was held accountable; and that was 
super motivating for me;” Adele describes the job as “empowering, especially as a thirteen 
year-old.”
●
Adele was aware of her family’s ﬁnances, and viewed the job as an “economic necessity”; 
mom talked to owner and helped her get the job; walked 3-miles to the job each way
●
Transition to front-of-house work at Village Bakery (00:28:00)
●
Discusses the culture and ethics and political commitments of the Village Bakery (00:29:00), 
from supporting local/sustainable agriculture to participating in anti-fracking organizing to 
other forms of “conscious” community involvement and mission; “took it all for granted” and 
hadn’t realized, growing up around Casa Nueva and then the Village Bakery, that this 
environment was relatively rare, for the restaurant industry (00:30:00); Adele feels that many 
Columbus restaurants claim to support local/sustainable agriculture; but rarely actually do it
●
“It was almost as if the bakery, and the restaurant … was just a solution to the problems them 
saw in farmers not having the market to support themselves; or people not having access to 
the kind of foods them should, every day of the week … so the whole system … was built 
around that intention. (00:32:00-00:33:00) 
●
“I was so submerged in this food utopia … that I didn’t think it was possible for a restaurant 
to open up a frozen bag of anything, or to not make their own bread, or to not make their 
own condiments, or to not source completely locally and organically, within a 30-mile radius 
of where it’s from … I think I grew up feeling like this is food; and anything else is crap. And 
that’s persisted.” (00:37:00)
●
Comparison with sister’s experience/foodways formation, having a ﬁrst job at McDonald’s 
00:39:00 -- End of High School & Future Visions // Moving to Columbus 
●
Intended to go to school in Columbus, at Ohio State University, to study architecture; but 
dad lost his job around the time when acceptances came out, and lost access to 50%-oﬀ 
tuition -- which forced Adele to reconsider what she wanted to do -- she had “skated by” in 
high school, and heading to college for more of that, at full-price of tuition, “didn’t seem like 
the right move”
●
Decided to move to Columbus anyway, but without a plan; moved in with her grandma while 
friends attended Ohio State; got a job at the North Market; and stayed living with grandma 
for almost a year-and-a-half, until she moved in with a friend who attended OSU
●
North Market job -- “another moment where I feel like it really shaped me, in a way that, if I 
had just gotten a job at a restaurant … I felt  like I wouldn’t have had the same experience. It 
was almost like a mini-high school; and … at a moment when the market was changing alot … 
are we going to be a market that sells fresh produce and poultry? Or are we gonna be a food 
hall? … being witness to that, and seeing the politics of it, and having the inﬂuence of 
working at the bakery … helped me develop a sense of community of my own.”
00:43:08 -- Work & Food Culture at A Touch of Earth Coffeeshop 
●
Step-mom’s younger sister had worked at the original Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams, at the 
North Market; and then transferred over to A Touch of Earth coﬀeeshop, owned by Anne 
Leonard -- herself the daughter of a family who owned a poultry place at the North Market
●
A Touch of Earth was later bought out by Stauf’s coﬀee; agreement was that they had to take 
on the employees who were already there, and pay them the same as they were already paid 
(for Adele: $12/hour, plus tips, by the end!)
●
When Adele started, owner Anne was there at the coﬀeeshop every other day, along with one 
other employee, and Adele’s aunt; described as a “10x10 square foot place”; working closely 
with the owner gave Adele a sense of what good-quality work looked like; “another example 
of the relationship you have with the community, as a business owner” (00:46:00)
●
“It was the only coﬀee in the market … and everyone drinks coﬀee”; so, A Touch of Earth 
ended up serving pretty much every business owner and employee in the market
●
Discusses the culture of mutual discounts amongst employees at the North Market; 
“possible, because it wasn’t corporate; it was just the owner, and she approved …”; “set the 
tone for how I approach customer service, in particular” (00:47:45)
●
Discusses the culture and community of the North Market -- including how it drew in all the 
chefs from downtown Columbus and the Short North shopping for fresh produce and spices, 
everyone in town at the convention center; “half the people, if not move, I know in 
Columbus I met just by either through either serving them coﬀee, or working close to them 
at the market” (00:49:00)
●
Discusses lack of front-of-house/back-of-house divide and roles at the coﬀee shop -- not an 
assembly line; “every week, there was another thing added to make it more eﬃcient,” 
towards being more consistent, having a better product, and making the work easier -- e.g. 
rearranging the displays (“merchandising”; this was a skill that Adele was good at and 
enjoyed); updating espresso machines or replacing equipment broken by the staﬀ, etc. -- 
“created a sense of: everything you do matters … everything can be better … and every eﬀort 
pays oﬀ” (00:51:00)
●
Learning how to be a barista (“I didn’t even drink coﬀee when I started the job”); 
participating, on the ﬁrst day, in a coﬀee event/training hosted by Brioso Coﬀee downtown; 
building a culture with other baristas around town
●
Discusses changes in Columbus coﬀee culture -- “when I started, latte art wasn’t a 
thing” (00:52:00); started out with “cheesy bad drinks” on the menu (irish cream + hazelnut + 
chocolate); aesthetic was: “cozy, caramel, everything is brown tone or maroon”
●
Owner stepped away to spend more time with family, and a manager came on board; and 
aesthetic became more “reﬁned” as it was taken over by young people wanting to make the 
business more “on trend” -- rise of “normcore” // minimalism (00:54:35) -- “I started to 
develop an appreciation for reﬁnement … I’d worked in places that served piles of hippie 
slop” (00:55:00) -- instead, learning to deliver “an experience,” getting good at latte art, etc.; 
and coming to take pride in being good at “factory-style consistent, one-after-the-other 
product, that people could depend on.” (00:55:55)
●
Learning consistency and how to tell how to make consistent coﬀee; “we started to weigh 
things … we started to taste things … it’s just a matter of knowing what you’re trying to 
achieve, being aware of the variables and how they’re slightly diﬀerent each time, and doing 
it repetitively … but, I really enjoy that. I’ve always enjoyed that.” (00:57:00) 
●
Discussion of how co-workers developed a sense of pride and consistency in their work; 
balancing devotion to consistency and delivering good customer service (00:59:00) -- “While 
me and my co-workers all kind of were moving towards this -- we want to be proud of this 
coﬀee shop we work in and the coﬀee it serves, I valued just: the sense of community, with 
the regular customers that we had, more than they did. And I think that was probably 
inﬂuenced by my experiences with my mom, working at the restaurant she did; and my own 
experience, working at the small community bakery” (00:59:30).
●
Discussion of job satisfaction, “which is a personal responsibility”; and the importance of 
knowing and interacting with customers, as something that makes the work more valuable 
(01:02:14)
01:02:15 -- Work Culture at the North Market 
●
Patrons & customer booms dictated by holidays, special events, conventions in Columbus
●
Description of the North Market’s interior and levels
●
Feeling like being “in a box,” or on display -- ﬁnding herself drawn by Columbus College of 
Art and Design students, or photographed by photographers, etc. 
●
Friendships and camaraderie with workers at the other stalls; “like a big high school”
●
Discussion of the diversity of employees -- from family-owned Indian restaurants to a stand 
with “a bunch of punk kids, who got each other the job … within the same twenty-feet of 
each other, every day”
●
Wages in a shared working space with the North Market
●
Started at A Touch of Earth at $8/hour; but got to split & keep all cash tips at the end of the 
shift; no square reader, so credit card tips weren’t an issue at the beginning; given a $.50 raise 
after a year -- negotiations around getting paid more (working “a little less than forty” hours 
per week); needed more money in order to pay rent for a house near campus with a friend, 
and told her boss she needed either a raise, or to ﬁnd a second job (was given $11/hr, + $5-6 
per hour in tips); paid more, again towards the end of the Touch of Earth Era, when Stauf’s 
Coﬀeeshop took over 
●
Plans moving forward -- didn’t intend to stay working in a coﬀee shop forever 
●
Working for other vendors at the North Market (01:15:00) -- poultry shop (“I hated it; I felt 
like a lunch lady”; “the only job I’ve ever been ﬁred from”); working at the Greener Grocer 
during weekdays (01:18:00)
●
Also recruited to work as a personal assistant to a real estate broker (01:19:00); worked with 
Lisa for over a year -- including driving to real estate oﬃce in Granville, helping with home 
renovations; discussion of working “in private” in the personal assistant job, -vs.- the culture 
of North Market kitchen/coﬀeeshop jobs; “she wanted to give me a chance to get out of the 
food industry”
●
Leaving the North Market; leaving the personal assistant job (“I didn’t feel like I was 
contributing anything”)  (01:25:00)
01:26:00 -- Venturing Out: Leaving the North Market // Till Dynamic Fare + Pop-Up 
Projects 
●
Seeing a Craigslist post for serving work at Till Dynamic Fare; Adele was interested in 
working at a restaurant and knew of Till’s reputation
●
Hobbled in the work -- couldn’t serve alcohol, because she was under-21; so, started out as a 
host/back-server/ “busser-person”
●
Around that time, her partner Jake joined as a member of the opening staﬀ at The Table, a 
restaurant down the street; both were deliberately seeking restaurant jobs, to learn how to 
cook and participate in the industry
●
Origin stories of Jacob Warren Reece Holler and Adele Ardrey’s “Gourmet Picnic” project 
(00:01:29); Jake started cultivating a “serious interest in food”; Adele was interested in 
curating the experience/dynamics of “the dining experience” -- especially, once she started 
working in ﬁne dining at Till Dynamic Fare; interest in Till’s cocktail program, even though 
she was too young to serve alcohol; (01:32:00) experience being the youngest member of the 
serving staﬀ; experience getting to know people from other walks of life (learning about the 
dance party // DJ scene through a co-worker, for example); older co-workers buying her 
drinks
●
01:35:00 -- Chef-driven culture in the kitchen, under Chef Magdiale W.; workers respected 
the chef, but kitchen took itself very seriously; and workers weren’t really allowed to 
participate in the kitchen; “knew you didn’t really have to be like that, to serve amazing food 
and run a beautiful restaurant.” 
●
Left Till and actually went back to a Touch of Earth; going back, after working at Till, and 
experiencing the discipline of ﬁne dining, she “saw everything diﬀerently”; Adele suddenly 
found herself applying kitchen workways from Till (even though she had never worked in the 
kitchen) to her work back at the coﬀee shop; “reﬁnement” (01:40:20)
01:40:50 -- All the Other Kitchens: Subsequent Food Service/Serving/Back-of-House 
Jobs 
●
Adele shares the larger trajectory of her work in the food industry in Columbus, from Touch 
of Earth to Till to the Greener Grocer
●
Then, started working in an elementary school, via AmeriCorps [Ohio Reading Corps]
●
Started doing supper clubs (“Gourmet Picnic”) at their ﬁrst house living together; Adele 
wanted to re-create the experience at Till
●
Started working at Alana’s Fine Dining, after her partner Jake quit; Adele had wanted to 
serve, but was recruited to start help at the cold station
●
01:43:00 -- Also began working at Acre: Farm to Table, “a cross between Northstar, Chipotle, 
and Wendy’s” -- a sort of fast-food/assembly-style farm-to-table restaurant; discussion of the 
potential of fast-casual in the Columbus food scene, but disappointment in the culture/space 
and the “assembly-line” experience of the kitchen work, which did not allow for pride in her 
work; also, about uniforms (01:47:50) -- blue gingham shirts and a royal blue bandana on the 
head; “that’s not a good look; even if everything is from Madewell.” Adele likens this job to 
“factory work” (01:49:15); and says this culture may be why it is diﬃcult of keeping “people 
who are talented, and friendly … there was no importance placed on learning. You were just 
there to do your job. Everywhere else … the more you possessed and the better you were at 
your job, the more valuable you were to them.” Also discusses the impact of not having any 
contact with the customer, in her back-of-house role; and deciding to leave Acres without 
two-weeks’ notice (01:50:45) when her friend Perry opened up a new cafe, Dough Mama.
01:51:15 -- Joining the Opening Team at Dough Mama // Culture at Dough Mama 
●
Describes meeting Perry, who eventually opened Dough Mama Café (pies/biscuit 
sandwiches/coﬀee/pastries) -- originally recruited from Brooklyn by Till for their desert 
program, then met Adele’s partner Jake helping to open Till, where she did pastries
●
Early build-up to Dough Mama selling pies at farmers’ markets at Yellow Brick Pizza; 
preparing pies for holiday orders, etc.
●
01:55:37 -- Occupational culture at Dough Mama; similarity (for Adele) to working at the 
Village Bakery (“it clicked, immediately”); reﬂections on the material culture and design of 
the space (“hip”; “full of handmade goods”); seeking new learning experiences and working 
with an all-female staﬀ; being able to wear whatever she wanted -- “it felt right … obviously, 
because I still work there!”
●
Works “front of house … [which] means alot … basically, anything that isn’t making biscuits, 
pie dough, and doing dishes”; describes the culture of everyone helping where they can to get 
the job done; not a rigid divide between people’s roles/duties (01:57:50)
●
02:00:00  -- culture and community of Dough Mama; the “vibes”; impact of working as a 
part of an all-female staﬀ // ”all women run the kitchen”; aﬀect/energy in the back-of-house 
space & inﬂuence
●
00:02:55 (Pt 2) -- describing back-of-house kitchen roles at Dough Mama as “blended,” the 
opposite of “factory work”
●
00:06:10 -- worker investment in the workplace at Dough Mama; but no ownership stake; 
facing the realities of pay ceilings/no beneﬁts/no job security (00:08:00)
●
00:12:00 -- On not talking about wages, at Dough Mama; Adele’s wages (00:15:00)
●
00:17:00 -- Long term employees doing extras; like representing the space at public panels or 
as a part of workshops // networking events at the cafe and building relationships with 
shopkeepers at fellow stores (independent boutique next door, the Sunroom)
(Pt 2) 18:57 -- Other Work: Paulie Gee’s (Wood-Fired Pizza Place) + Jewelweed Floral 
Studio 
●
Adele describes her three total jobs (Dough Mama; bartending/serving at Paulie Gee’s; and 
working as a ﬂorist at Jewelweed Floral Studio) and why she likes working three diﬀerent 
jobs -- aﬀords more time to focus on hobbies (sewing; AirBnB hosting) -- “doing diﬀerent 
things, not being stagnant, not being too routine while also being routine in it” (00:23:10)
●
(Pt 3. 00:01:27) Considering possibilities outside of the restaurant industry; why she stays in 
the industry -- “I think I’m super motivated by other people; and the people that I work 
with, I think, I make the most of, as far as pursuing the things I am interested in, so far.” -- 
e.g. sewing pottery studio pants for a bakery co-worker who is also a ceramicist; or sewing 
outﬁts for a customers’ nieces as a Christmas gift
●
(00:05:00) Work/life balance and cultivating hobbies and interests through work -- like 
structural interior design through ﬂoral design work at Jewelweed Floral Studios; ambitions 
to go to college for “interior architecture” -- deeply connected to working inside at designed 
spaces within these jobs
●
(00:08:00) Working at Paulie Gee’s -- “it’s pretty casual, but I make it fancy, because I like 
fancy!”; connected to the job through fellow project interviewee Jeremy Purser; began by 
waiting tables; learning how to bartend & depending entirely on tips (00:10:00); talking 
about wages at Paulie Gee’s (00:14:00); “Fun/Flirty” restaurant culture: “if we’re all having a 
good time, our customers will hang out longer … and we’ll make more money. So, it’s kind of 
like a party all the time” // taking shots with co-workers (00:15:00); 
●
00:15:10: Spending extra time putting makeup on and getting ready for work // spending lots 
of time before work putting on makeup “to superﬁcially have a good time with these 
strangers, and have them buy expensive wine … even if we don’t outright say that, that is the 
culture restaurants create, when the employees are dependent on tips. And sometimes I 
question … if it’s worth it.”
●
00:16:00 -- comparing wages at Paulie Gee’s; -vs.- not talking about it at Dough Mama
●
00:19:00 -- challenges to ﬁnding ethical // local sourcing and comparing Columbus 
restaurants’ sourcing practices to those at the Village Bakery in Athens; and thinking about 
sourcing as a part of launching Companion Bagel (scratch sourdough bagel pop-up) with Jake 
Holler, another project interviewee (00:20:00) -- Restaurant Depot -vs.- local sources; “the 
way they’re prepared and the environment they’re prepared in” as really the only diﬀerence 
between high-end and fast food that all shop at places like Restaurant Depot (00:21:00); 
concerns about restaurants that aim for proﬁt over sourcing and social impact 
00:22:23  (Pt. 3) -- Inﬂuence of Village Bakery: Restaurant Ethics in Columbus 
●
Adele describes inﬂuence of Village Bakery on how she sees the food industry in Columbus
●
“There so much empty talk … when it’s discussed, whether it’s through magazines or co-
workers or customers asking questions and getting canned responses from fellow co-workers 
… it makes me sick. And it makes me frustrated. And I wish I could articulate it in a 
diplomatic way that didn’t compromise my job … to talk about how messed up the food 
system is, from the very core. And how that is through false advertising and marketing and … 
people just don’t have a realistic understand or expectation … and I don’t think people are 
willing to pay what it costs, for food to be what they like to pretend it is. And that’s 
frustrating … but, by participating in it at all … I feel I don’t have room to criticize anyone 
else. Because we could all be doing better.” (00:24:00)
●
00:25:54 -- “Every dollar is a vote for what you want … systematically.”
00:26:00 (Pt 3) -- Pop-Up/DIY Food Enterprises: Gourmet Picnic & Companion Bagel 
●
Making diﬀerent sourcing/food systems choices when launching her own underground 
supper club, and pop-up sourdough bagel bakery
●
(00:28:00) Gourmet Picnic Supper Club (2014-2015) as a once-a-month supper club hosted at 
Adele and Jake Holler’s house on Medary Avenue; functioned as a “social experiment … a 
chance for people who worked in restaurants, but maybe behind-the-scenes, and who were 
pursuing their creative calling in cooking, but really didn’t have the platform to express 
themselves in the way they wanted … it gave them the freedom to do that. And we gave them 
the freedom to source their own ingredients.” 
●
(00:29:10) -- Starting a “little bagel business” (Companion Bagel/ Companion Baking) was a 
chance for Adele and Jake to make their own local sourcing decisions; Adele describes that 
this was impossible, in large part, because they were given a space to make their bagels for 
basically free. This enabled them to buy local ﬂour and buy from local farmers. Examples of 
ﬂavors of bagels! (00:30:00) -- serrano/date bagel, with serranos from local farmers.-- 
●
00:31:35 -- With Companion Bagel, they took the model of buying local ingredients, and then 
using the bagels as a blank slate. Also, discussion of diﬃculties trying to source entirely local/
organic ﬂower from Stutzman Farms; wasn’t the right sort of wheat for the gluten content 
required for a bagel, so they cut it with another ﬂour -- but used as a high of a ratio of the 
local/organic Ohio ﬂour as possible. 
●
00:34:00 -- Bartering for ingredients at the local farmers’ market where Companion Bagel 
sold their goods; Adele’s conviction that people should be able to barter locally, on a bigger 
scale, “to make each other's’ goals or product dreams possible … it was a good reminder of 
how things can be done, on a small scale, to support yourself; but also kind of, at the same 
time, a reminder that, if we ever wanted to go beyond that, we would have to go way beyond 
that … and then it wouldn’t be what it was.” Challenges trying to scale up -- to more than 2 
farmers’ markets; or to deliver bagels to farmers’ markets or grocery stores around 
Columbus; increase in overhead (use of facility, work with employees, etc.; all of which 
requires more proﬁt; which requires cuts.)  Adele eventually made $12/hour in the bagel 
business; she isn’t sure what Jake made. 
●
00:39:48 -- Considering Jack Bennett’s idea (also shared in his project interview) of chef-
owned restaurant group (-vs.- Columbus’ investor-owned restaurant chains) -- “I feel like 
there needs to be more of a focus on the individual restaurant … these businesses are all 
owned by one person, one couple … and all the eﬀort is funneled into them making the 
money they need to keep those businesses going; I think alot of compromises are made along 
the way. But, if each individual business was owned by someone with alot at stake, and alot 
invested, personally, they would probably be run alot diﬀerent. And the web that would 
create, or the trickle eﬀect that would create in the community … to do that well … would 
make it more possible.” 
00:43:00 (Pt. 3) Final Questions: Home Cooking 
●
Adele discusses having less of a relationship with food in her home kitchen, because “you eat 
most of your meals in the restaurant, when you work morning and night in them”; also, her 
partner Jeﬀ cooks most of their meals. Working in restaurants also makes her less impressed 
when eating out; Adele mentions Dai Due (Austin, Texas) -- “they’re doing it right … you just 
have to applaud it, when you see it done well.” 
●
00:46:00 -- changes in the Columbus food scene [00:47:25 -- LOUD NOISE WARNING; 
interviewer drops glass bottle]; Adele discusses trends, rise of gastro-pub restaurants and 
catering to dietary restrictions; faddish partial concern with local sourcing; rise of interest in 
plant-based cuisine as a spur to more ethical sourcing 
●
00:50:11 -- More reﬂections on sourcing, ethics, and the food system:  “I don’t think people 
are willing to pay the cost of food; but the pay-oﬀ … would be worth it.”
●
00:50:30 -- Future for Adele in/out of the food industry; problems of hitting wage ceilings 
and burdens/dilemmas of scaling up: “there’s only so far you can take it, before you have to 
start making those choices …” // “For now: it really is just a job … I’m making the most of it 
and learning from it, but I plan to use the experience in other ways … even in a place like 
Dough Mama, where I am so valued: there’s only so far you can take it.” Planning on going to 
school.
●
00:53:00 “it’s valuable work; and I feel like everybody should do it. Because everyone goes 
out to eat …. everyone needs to know … what they’re paying for. They need to know what 
they’re supporting. They need to know those skills for themselves. And if working in a 
restaurant is what it takes to learn it, then I encourage everyone to do it. It’s not valueless 
work, for sure. I’ve learned, clearly, so many lessons -- whether it’s discipline, or organization, 
or the social skills it takes to pursue other things. But, yeah: it’s, I think: my 20’s will be that 
time that I spent in restaurants; but, I hope by 30’s will be spent pursuing a career.”
●
00:55:23 -- “I’ve just, kind of, grown up in the restaurant industry; and, until this interview, I 
never really thought about how prevalent it’s been in my life. And that’s kind of cool to 
reﬂect on. Because I do … I do come from it; and it’s interesting how, up until this point, it’s 
all I’ve known, really.” 
00:57:00 -- Concluding Slate, Thanks & Goodbyes
