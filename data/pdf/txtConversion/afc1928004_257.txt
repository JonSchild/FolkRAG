York. 
Price 35 cents. 
I'm getting old and feeble now, I 
cannot work no more; 
I've laid de rusty-bladed hoe to rest ; 
Ole massa an' ole miss's am dead, dey're sleepin' side by side; 
Deir spirits now are roaming wid de blest ! 
De scene am changed about de place, de darkies am all gone ; 
I'll nebber hear dew singing in de cane, 
And Fse de only one dat's left wid dis ole dog ob mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane. 
CHORUS . 
De chimney's falling clown an' de roof is cavin' in ; 
I 
ain't got long round here to remain ; 
But de angels watches over me when I 
lays down to sleep 
in de little old log cabin in de lane. 
Dar was a 
happy time to me, ' twas many years ago, 
When de darkies used to (*tither round de door ; 
When dey used to dance an' sing at night I 
played the old banjo, 
But alas, I 
cannot play it any more. 
De hinges dey got rusted an' de door has tumbled down, 
And de roof lets in de sunshine an' de rain, 
An' de only friend I've got, now is dis good ole dog ob mine, 
In de little old log cabin in de lane.

De foot- path now is covered o'er dat led us round de hill, 
And de fences all are going to decay, 
An' de creek is all dried up where we used to go to miii;

DOWN IN THE MINE, 
By GEORGE 110EY. 
Wows and fatigued with travelling, I 
stopped for a 
night on the 
road, 
At a 
public house called " The Lantern, or Miner's Retreat and 
Abode," 
Whence nightly, around beer- stained tables, are gathered these 
toilers of earth ; 
While loud songs o'er their full " pints o' bitter," give signs of 
their unstinted mirth, 
I 
at once made my way to the tap-room, and booked myself 
there for the night, 
But confess I 
was somewhat bewildered at the strange and 
weird looking sight ; 
For the glare of the few half burnt candles, as it fell on these 
hard- featured men, 
With rough beards and hair all disheveled, brought to my mind 
some dark den 
Or cave, the u. int of bold robbers, who live by the fruit of their 
knife, 
With no knowledge of " meum and tuum," and little regard for 
one's life. 
As I 
seated myself at the table, drinking my measure of beer, 
One, who seemed foreman among them, read in a 
voice loud 
and clear, 
From a 
paper " he got down from Lunnon," and the news, tho' 
not very late, 
Was as eagerly listened to by them as if it were yesterday's 
date ; 
When suddenly, one from among them, started with eyes star-
ing, wide, 
And in less time than I 
take to tell 
it, stool by the reading 
man's side 
DOWN IN THE MINE.—Continued. 
For his eyes caught the large lettered heading, and seizing the 
paper, he read : 
" 
Mel hourne—Sth of Odober—Brandon, the mine owner dead 
"Nay, take your hands off me, comrades, the man who has 
just passed away, 
Carried Job Thorudyke's curse with him, and my curse over-
took him that day ; 
For ten long years I 
have tracked him, and sought him by foul 
means and fair ; 
But he's gone to a 
Higher Tribunal, and the Great Judge will 
try him up there. 
Hark, lads, till I 
tell you my story ; I'll make it as brief as I 
can : 
You knew when I 
first came among you, I 
had been in the 
mine, boy and man, 
You know if my hand could assist you my tongue should never 
say 
no 
But, now, lads, I'm going to tell you something that none of 
you know. 
I 
once had a 
mate who worked with me, and stood by my side 
from a 
bay ; 
We first handled pickax together in the mines on the Moors of 
Glenroy, 
Phil had one care, ' twas his daughter, the pride and joy of the 
town, 
Who stood by the shaft every morning, and kissed him before 
be went down. 
Oae day, I 
shall never forget it, I 
came to the mine rather late, 
Nelly, his daughter, was with me, she had joined me below at 
his gate : 
Her diamond eyes looked up Wards mine, and a 
smile lit up 
her bright face, 
When we suddenly heard an explosion, and our very mine was 
ablaze. 
We ran till we came to the derrick, where round the shaft's 
mouth, row by row, 
Stood the widows and little half orphans of the poor fellows 
burning below ; 
(2) 
8 
DOWN IN THE MINE.—Continued. 
Then the basket came up heavy laden with those who had grap-
pled with death, 
And left the field wounded and dying, some having spent their 
last breath. 
I 
stood for a 
moment bewildered ; when Nelly pulled hard at 
my coat 
And said to me, ` Job, where's my papa V—then something 
stuck fast in my throat, 
And my eyes filled all full of water, and I 
called to the men at 
the line, 
As I 
jumped in the now burning basket, 
Who's with me, lads, 
down in the mine ?' 
Thee stood at my side in a moment, all eager for glory and 
fame. 
The signal was given to lower us down in that red sea of flame. 
Once I 
tried to shout 
Faster,' but the smoke deprived me of 
breath ; 
When at last we stood at the bottom, in the city of carnage and 
death. 
I 
had not stepped over ten paces when I 
stumbled and fell to 
the ground ; 
But that fall brought me good fortune, for ' twas none other 
than Phil I 
had found. 
lie was up in my arms in a moment, to the pit-hole I 
then 
quickly came, 
But there disappointment o'ertook us— the basket was one sheet 
of flame ; 
I 
tightened my arms rounl his body, with the other the stout 
chain I 
grasped ; 
Phil tried to murmur out something, but his head fell back as 
he gasped. 
I 
then pulled the chain for the signal, which, thank God, they 
understood right, 
And soon we were bound on our joyrney up to the great land 
of Eght. 
Nelly then sprang to her father, who laid there a 
poor broken 
mass ; 
He said to me, ` Job, for old time's &the, have a 
kind eye to my 
lass ; 
DOWN IN THE MINE.—Concluded. 
And, Nelly, love him as your father.' 
These were the last 
words he said ; 
And the soul of honest Phil Morris up a 
golden and silver shaft 
sped. 
I 
took Nelly home to the cabin—she proved the sole joy of my 
life— 
And when her years blossomed upon her, the church made us 
both man and wife. 
We lived as happy together as any poor couple can ; 
But at last were :,tung by a 
serpent, that came in the shape of a 
man. 
lie shared a 
piece in the household, at table sat by my side, 
But when I 
was down in the darkness he poisoned the ear of 
my bride ; 
And one night when I 
came to the cabin, I 
found my pretty 
bird flown, 
And I 
sank on my knees by the bedside, when I 
found I 
was 
left all alone. 
Years and years I 
sought for her, and at last, one cold winter's 
day, 
Found her, stricken with fever, where the villain had cast her 
a 
way. 
She sued to me then for forgiveness—she had it—and all that 
I 
said 
Was, ' Nelly, I 
sought till 1 
found you, and so kept my word 
with the dead.' 
When Nelly died I 
searched for him ; my conscience would ne'er 
let me be ; 
But I 
read my revenge in this paper from all the way over the 
sea. 
My story and mission are ended; what comes to me now I 
don't care ; 
He stands in the dock for his trial, and they have no acquittal 
up there." 
And so his story was finished ; all was as still as the tomb ; 
Ile slowly folded the helper, and made his way out of the room. 
I 
have of thought of the sad recital—told with no eloquence 
fine, 
And see how that sorrow and misery will even creep " Down in 
the Mine."

UPON the rustic bridge we met 
One afternoOn in spring ; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailing on the lake, 
And all the park was gay; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way ! 
The flowers were bright, but oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night; 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delioht; 
I 
seemed in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat, 
And while his eyes did on me beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Fray tell me, is there, dear 7 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park." 
We strolled along where roses grew, 
And all was bright and fair; 
Ile promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home; 
They heard my lips reply, 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we said good-bye. 
(I)

THERE IS NO HARM IN KISSING.—Concluded. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave' 
4 
Its dear bewitching spell ! 
We lingered though the hour was late. 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
lie softly to me said, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear 7 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park."

LOST in the wide world, hopeless and weary; 
Gone is the gladness that made life so clear I 
Dark is my pathway, lonesome and dreary ; 
No smile to cheer me is lingering near I 
Once bloom'd around me life's fairest roses ; 
Loved ones and fond ones now cheer me no more; 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore. 
Lost in the wide world, wand'rincr in sadness, 
Dreaming of dear ones who left me in tears, 
Stars of the midnight whisper with gladness, 
" 
Loved ones are waiting, then hush all my fears I" 
Oh, how I 
miss them, life's lovely roses 
Sweet voices call me to yon further shore! 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore! 
Lost iu the wide world, etc.

runs dry. 
As years rolled on I 
grew to be 
A 
mischief- waking boy, 
Destruction seemed my only sport, 
It was my only joy ;. 
And well do I 
remember, 
When oft times well chastised, 
How father sat beside me then, 
And thus has me advised :—Cno. 
When I 
arrived at manhood, 
I 
embarked in public life, 
And found it was a 
rugged road, 
Bestrewn with care and strife; 
I 
speculated foolishly, 
My losses were severe, 
But still a 
tiny little voice 
Kept whispering in my ear :—CEto. 
Then I 
studied strict economy. 
And found, to my surprise, 
Mv funds instead of sinking; 
Very quickly then did rise. 
I 
grasped each chance, and always struck 
The iron while 'twas hot, 
I 
seized my opportunities 
And never once forgot :—Cno. 
I'm married now and happy, 
I've a 
careful little wife, 
We 
live in peace and harmony, 
Devoid of care and strife-; 
Fortune smiles upon us, 
We have little children three, 
The lesson that I 
teach them. 
As they prattic round my knee :—Cuo.

W HAT! no! it can't be that they've driven 
Their father, so helpless and old, 
(Oh, God, may their crime be forgiven,) 
To perish out here in the cold. 
Oh, Heavens, I 
am sadden'd and weary, 
See the tears bow they course down my cheeks ! 
Oh, this world it is lonely and dreary, 
And my heart for relief vainly seeks. 
CHORUS. 
For I'm old, and I'm helpless and feeble, 
The days of my youth have gone by; 
Then over the hill to the poor house. 
I 
wander alone there to die. 
Ah, me! on that old door-step yonder, 
I've sat with my babes on my knee ; 
No father was happier or fonder 
Than I 
of my little ones three. 
The boys, both so rosy and chubby, 
And Lilly with prattle so sweet ! 
God knows how their father has loved them, 
But they've driven him out in the street. 
For I'm old,

OVER THE HILL TO THE POOR HOUSE.— 
Concluded. 
It's long years since my Mary was taken, 
My faithful affectionate wife ; 
Since then I'm forlorn and forsaken, 
And the light has died out of my life. 
The boys grew to manhood; I 
gave them 
A 
deed for the farm! ay, and more, 
I 
gave them this house they were born in 
And now I'm turned out from its door. 
For I'm old, etc. 
Oh, children! loved children ! yet hear me, 
I 
have journeyed along on life's stage; 
With the hope that you all would be near me, 
To comfort and cheer my old age. 
My life-blood I'd gladly have given, 
To shield and protect you! but hark! 
Though my heart breaks, 
say it's you've driven 
Me out tere to die in the dark. 
For I'm old. etc. 
But, perhaps, they'll live happier without me ; 
Farewell, dear old home, ah! farewell! 
Each pathway and tree here about me, 
Some memory precious can tell. 
Well, the flowers will bloom bright as ever, 
And the birds sing as sweet to the morn; 
Then over the hill from the poor house, 
Next Spring the old man shall be borne. 
For I'm old. etc.

ONLY A CLOWN. 
By GEORGE M ET. 
Yes, thanks, sir, I'll have a 
small measure of beer, though I 
don't 
often treat myself so ; 
I'm ‘• Only a 
Clown " with no kindred or friends no life but 
that in the show ; 
My heaven—the canvas that covers our ring, and shields us 
from rains and from heats, 
My horizon— all that I 
ever have known, ends with the last row 
of seats. 
I 
was once not alone as you see me to-day, I'd a mate in my 
" 
Act on the Bar." 
My wife, she's an angel in heaven I 
know—on earth she was 
always a 
star. 
How did the die 7 No every day death; I'll tell you—but first 
let me pause— 
She died of a 
shock she got in the ring— and I 
myself was the 
cause. 
'Twas a 
benefit night, about five years ago ; the tent stood in 
this very place, 
Every seat had been sold the morning before, the people had 
come from a 
race; 
We had a 
dangerous " Act on the Bar," but we all got a 
small 
extra fee, 
Our turn was the next, we stood at the gate ; Cordello, Polly 
and me. 
I 
feared this Cordell°, a 
man in our troupe, with his piercing 
and wicked black eyes, 
And he hated me \with all of his heart, as I'd stolen away his 
great prize ; 
For he'd often asked Polly to come be his wife, but no answer 
from her could he get, 
And I've known him to swear by all that was good, that he 
" 
would be square with me yet." 
The act it was this—a 
bar hung on high some fifty-five feet 
from the ground, 
Cordell° would bang, and Polly and I 
were to spring in his 
hands with a 
bound ; 
(1) 
4I 
• 
ONLY A CLOWN.—Coiacluded. 
A 
dangerous trick, as you'll see at a 
glance, and one that de-
pends all in all, 
On the man that's above, for were he inclined, he could let 
either one of us fall. 
We sprang into the ring amid the applause, seemingly pleased 
for the while, 
But my heart it beat fast, and I 
shook like a 
leaf, for I 
read 
that dark man's wicked smile ; 
Then we each took our place for this leap into death! Cordell° 
was quickly on high, 
But his lips seemed to say as he went up the rope, " our time's 
come ; it's now you or I." 
He had fixed himself firm and swung by his knees, the music 
was braying out loud, 
My wife posed herself to spring to his arms, or else dash head-
long in the crowd. 
,the signal was given—one bound did she make—thank God 
her arms tight round his neck, 
Now ' twas for me to trust my life there, or else fall below a 
poor wreck. 
He stretched out his hands, but it seemed just the same as the 
devil, who always cries " come 
His eyes they stared wild, I 
then saw the truth, the man was 
half crazy with rum, 
My eyesight was dim, all seemed in a 
blur, in a 
second away I 
would be, 
When my wife swung around, and hung by the bar and cried 
loudly, " Ben, jump to me." 
It was there that I 
jumped, and was safe in her arms before 
half a 
second could pass; 
Cordell° was swung from the bar by the shock to the ring far 
below, a 
mere mass. 
But Polly grew worse from that very pight, she so gallantly 
saved my poor life— * 
And that's why you see me sir, " Only a 
Clown," no money, no 
friends and no wife.

MULCAHY'S GONE AWAY, 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H . 
H ARDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York.

Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
S3IELIAC. 
THE hero of my humble song 
Was once a 
mighty man, 
A 
shining light in his neighborhood, 
And chief of all his clan ; 
But when he found in course of time 
The tricks his friends did play, 
Sure he left them all, and now they cry, 
Mulcahy's gone away ! 
He was great and grand, and took command 
Of the boys on Patrick's day ; 
But now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away. 
He won our pride and won our praise, 
And he deserved it too! 
Sure many a 
time for nights and days 
We stuck to him like glue; 
He held an office of the State, 
And faith he made it pay; 
But for such a 
place he was too great, 
And now he's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
The politicians worshipped him, 
And swore he'd yet be Mayor ; 
And tho' the chance looked rather dim, 
He thought it bright and fair; 
(1)

MULCAHY'S GONE AWAY. —Continued. 
But ere he came to rule the toms, 
his mind was led astray, 
And now the cry is everywhere, 
Mulcahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He was as sound a 
Democrat 
As ever filled a 
chair, 
But he lost his great position, 
And it drove him to despair; 
We know not where to seek for him; 
He must have crossed the say; 
0, it grieves us just to think of it— 
Aluicahy's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
He treated us like gintlenien 
Whenever we did meet; 
The sight of him would do you good, 
From his head down to his feet; 
He wore a 
collar stiff' and high, 
Which made a 
great display; 
He was a 
most distinguished man— 
But now he's gone away! 
He was great, etc. 
The girls went crazy when he winked, 
And many an artful plan 
They put in operation for 
To catch this darlin' man; 
But now they're left alone, poor things; 
They weep and wail, and say— 
Oh, what'll we do at all, at all 1 
Mulcahy's gone away!

He was great, etc.

Oh, dear, I'm nearly starving, 
I 
want something nice to eat 
I

I'd polish off a

No bird that flies is half so nice.

Of Partridge or of Pheasant, 
A dinner I 
could make. 
I 
like corned beef and mustard, 
Or sirloin steak with juice, 
Or Prairie hen or Bustard fat, 
But most I 
love a 
Goose! 
For it is my opinion, ite. 
I've liver tried and bacon, 
And tripe both boiled and fried; 
A 
sheep's- head I 
have taken, 
And put myself outside. 
Though turtle soup is filling. 
And fish-balls joy produce; 
'Tis not the rapture or the joy, 
That appertains to Goose!

There have been men of genius who have died of despair, 
Unrewarded by fortune and fame; 
In vain they have struggled for many long years, 
They could not establish a name. 
Perhaps you will ask me the reason-it is: 
Their modesty caused their defeat, 
They've been passed, in the road for position and plael. 
By some numskull with heaps of conceit. -
Cho. 
So if you have talent, don't hide it, my friend, 
That is, if to risc. 
you aspire ; 
The higher you raise it the more men will praise 
If you tell them just what to admire ; 
For the public will follow the leader, my boys, 
Like sheep that are led to a 
fold; 
So if you just tell them how clever you are, 
Ten to one, they'll believe what they're told.- Cho. 
Blow your own trumpet, and blazon your name, 
Wherever you happen to be; 
Don't wait for a 
herald to trumpet your name, 
If distinguished you're anxious to be. 
Don't go to the rear, but push on, never fear, 
And do not forget my advice, 
But blow your own trumpet as onward you go, 
And you'll get to the front in a 
trier. - Cho.

ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH. 
By GEORGE nOET. 
4 
TuE first thing that I 
remember was Carlo tugging away, 
With the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth, pulling as much as 
to say : 
" 
Come, master, awake, and tend to the switch, lives now de: 
pend upon you, 
Think of the souls in the coming train and the graves you're 
sending them to ; 
Think of the mother and babe at her breast, think of the 
father and son, 
Think of the lover, and loved•one, too, think of them doomed 
every one 
To fall, as it were, by your very hand, into you fathomless 
ditch, 
Murdered by one who should guard them from harm, who now 
lies asleep at the switch." 
I 
sprang up amazed, scarce knew where I 
stood, sleep had o'er 
mastered me so ; 
I 
could hear the wind hollowly bowling and the deep river dashing 
below, 
I 
could hear the forest leaves rustling as the trees by the tem-
pest were fanned, 
But what was that noise at a 
distance ? 
That—I 
could not 
understand ! 
I 
heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling of some muffled 
drum, 
Then nearer and nearer it came to me, and made my very ears 
hunt; 
What is this light that surrounds me and seems to set fire to 
my brain ? 
What whistle's that yelling so shrilly ! 
Oh, God ! 
I 
know now 
—it's the train. 
(1) 
ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH.—Continued. 
We often stand facing some danger, and seem to take root to 
the place ; 
So I 
stood with this demon before me, its heated breath scorch-
ing my face, 
Its headlight made day of the darkness, and glared like the 
eyes of some witch ; 
The train was almost upon me, before I 
remembered the switch. 
I 
sprang to it, seizing it wildly, the train dashing fast down the 
track, 
The switch resisted my efforts, some devil seemed bolding it 
back ; 
On, on, came the fiery- eyed monster and shot by my face like a 
flash ; 
I 
swooned to the earth the next moment, and knew nothing 
after the crash. 
How long I 
laid there unconscious, were impossible for me to 
tell, 
My stupor was almost a 
heaven, my waking almost a 
hell— 
For I 
then beard the piteous moaning and shrieking of husbands 
and wives, 
And I 
thought of the day we all shrink from, when I 
must ac-
count for their lives ; 
Mothers rushed by me like maniacs, their eyes staring madly 
and wild ; 
Fathers, losing their courage, gave way to their grief like a 
child ; 
Children searching for parents, I 
noticed, as by me they sped, 
And lips that could form naught but " Mamma," were calling 
for one perhaps dead. 
My mind was made up in a 
second, the river should hide me 
away ; 
When, under the still burning rafters, I 
suddenly noticed there 
lay 
(2) 
- 
ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH.—Concluded. 
A 
little white hand, she who owned it was doubtless an object 
of love 
To one whom her loss would drive frantic, tho' she guarded him 
now from above ; 
I 
tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid them one side ; 
How little she thought of her journey, when she left for this last 
fatal ride ; 
I 
lifted the last log from off her, and while searching for some 
spark of life. 
Turned her little face up in the starlight, and recognized— 
Maggie, my wife! 
Oh, Lord ! Thy scourne is a hard one, at a blow Thou bast 
shattered my pride ; 
My life will be one endless night.time, with Maggie away from 
my side ; 
How often we've sat down and pictured the scenes in our long 
happy life ; 
How I'd strive through all of my life- time to build up a 
home 
for my wife. 
How people would em vv us always in our cozy and neat little 
nest., 
When I 
would do all of the labor, and Maggie should all the 
day rest t 
how one of God's blessings might Omer us, when some day I 
p'r'aps should be rich, 
But all of my dreams have been shattered, while I 
lay there 
asleep at the switch. 
I 
fancied I 
stood on my trial, the jury and judge I 
could 
And every eye in the court room was steadfastly fixed upon 
me ; 
And fingers were pointed in scorn, till I 
felt my face blushing 
blood- red, 
And the next thin°. I 
heard were the words, " Hung by the 
neck until dead." 
Then I 
felt myself pulled once again, and my hand caught 
tight hohl of a 
dress, 
And I 
heard, " What's the matter, dear Jim 
You've had a 
bad niold-mare I 
guess." 
And there stood Maggie my wife with never a scar from the 
ditch, 
I'd been taking a 
nap hi my bed and had not been asleep at 
the switch.

YOU ARE TOO SLEEBY.

You may dink dot I'm grazy, or that I'm drunk, perhaps, 
But since I

Yone day I 
popped de gwestion, und said dot I'd be true; 
I

Yen she got up and shook me just because I 
chanced to gap.

Und he vos eatin' ' tread mid cheese, at a

Und efery drink he got dat night vos put down on der shlate ; 
But a

Und said it vos der same old drunk, mid belted him mit his

Und den lie kicked him mit his hand, but all dot he could say, 
Vos, " I

"

For my vather vos a

Und get his old plack pottle out, and den he'd get blind drunk, 
But ven he died mid left, us, on account ov his ill- health,

But I

Und it's empty now, at Coney Island, Coney Island down der 
Bay. 
" 
Tell my brothers and combanions, ven der early boat comes

Und prings der New York papers to dot fairest Coney Town, 
Yrtst to look among der items, vere everything is fame ; 
Und heading der Bolice It?,bort, he's sure to found my name. 
Tell him not to gry about it, put mit joy der news to hail, 
Und iv he's going der gotne to town, be sure und prin.T, my

But dell him, ov you please, sir, dot der last vords as I

" 
Say dot in der Tombs around me, vos an awful lot ov beats, 
Vot vos going to der

Und some vos dere vor murder, und vos going to veel der cords, 
Und a

Und some vos young und suddenly vos brought to Centre

Und chucked into der little cell, vot didn't got ten feet. 
But some vos dere vor getting drunk, und der fine dey gouldn't

MY LOVE SHE IS A FAIRY QUEEN. 
MY 
love she is a 
fairy queen— 
About her face no paint is seen; 
Her pretty foot is very small, 
But very large is her waterfall; 
Her ankle too so plump and fat, 
It makes my heart go pit-a-pat; 
Were I 
a 
bee upon her lip, 
I'd stay all day and sip and sip. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, she never flirts—she's no coquette; 
She never scolds, nor does she fret; 
She's some on style, and full of fun; 
" 
Yon bet your life," she's number one. 
I 
took her to a 
show one night, 
I 
almost knew ' would please her quite; 
And as we sat in the parquette, 
How nice I 
felt I 
scarce can say; 
The bell it rang, the curtain rose ; 
A man came out in spangled clothes, 
Entrancing me with dashing style, 
While to my love he gave a 
smile. 
Oh, she Never flirt; etc. 
To see my love next day I 
went— 
To pop the question was my intent; 
Alas I 
poor me, I 
felt quite sore 
To hear she'd gone in a 
coach and four; 
Her mother squealed and I 
did squall; 
She'd took her trunk and waterfall; 
.I seized my hat—to the show I 
ran, 
But she'd eloped with a 
circus man. 
0!1, she never flirts, etc. 
STAND ME OF MY LITTLE ELEAD. 
A IR.—" Put me in my Little Bed." 
Oti! Snyder, don't you sing some more, 
For dat olt song vas all blayed oud ; 
Uud uf you don't got some jeckuptions,

M ERE'S a 
letter in the candle, 
And it points direct to me; 
How the little spark is shining, 
From whoever can it be? 
It get's brighter still and brighter, 
Like a 
little sunny ray, 
And I 
dare to guess the writer, 
For it drives suspense away. 
CRORITS. 
Bright spark of hope, 
Shed your beams on me, 
And send a 
loving message 
From far across the sea. 
Hope and fear alike perplex me: 
Oh, superstitious dread, 
How many idle fancies 
You conjure in my head; 
When those we love are absent, 
How w.antonly you play— 
Ev'ry shadow seems a 
substance, 
And drives suspense away. 
Bright spark of hope, etc. 
How gladly I 
remember, 
'Tis two short months—no more, 
Since a 
letter in the candle 
Shone out as bright before; 
Then the darling messenger 
Came prompt and safe to me; 
If this is only from the same, 
How welcome it shall be. 
Bright spark of hope, etc.

DARLING, I 
am growing old, 
Sdver threads among the gold

Life is fading fast away; 
But, my darling, you will be—will be 
Always young and fair to me— 
Yes! my darling, you will be 
Always young and fair to me. 
enonus. 
Darling, T 
am growing, growing old, 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon my brow to- day; 
Life is fading fast away. 
When your hair is silver white, 
And your cheeks no longer bright 
With the roses of the May, 
I 
will kiss your lips and say— 
" 
Oh, my darling, mine alone—alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Yes! my darling, mine alone, 
You have never older grown ! 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love can never more grow old; 
Locks may lose their brown and geld, 
Cheeks may fade and hollow grow, 
But the hearts that love will know 
Never, never winter's frost and chill; 
Summer's warmth is in them still— 
Never winter's frost and chill, 
Summer's warmth is in them still. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc. 
Love is always young and fair— 
What to us is silver hair, 
Faded cheeks, or steps grown slow, 
To the heart that beats below ? 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, alone, 
You have never older grown— 
Since I 
kissed you mine alone, 
Yon have never older grown. 
Darling, I 
am growing, etc.

!CHI, LESS I SAY OF IT, THE BETTER. 
Written and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
Ara.—" It's wonderful bow we do it, but we do." 
New songs will come around, 
As new subjects they abound, 
And the one I've got, I 
think is just the cheese, too, 
And if it makes a 
bit, 
Why then, I 
don't care a 
bit, 
For my object is for to sing and to please you. 
It's a 
saying, by the way, 
That you hear every day, 
And sometimes you may read it in a 
letter ; 
So with no more preface, 
I 
will introduce my case— 
For, I 
think the less I 
say of it, the better. 
A 
young man in the street, 
A 
pretty girl does meet, 
And introduces himself by sweet talking ; 
She thinks he is so nice, 
For he talks as smooth as ice 
To her, as along the street they're walking ; 
And not long after that, 
She's got on a 
new hat, 
And way up town we find that he has met her ; 
And when it does get dark, 
They walk into the park— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better. 
I've been idle just a 
year, 
And I'm feeling rather queer, 
to where I'm going for to raise some money ; 
For it's true, upon my life, 
I've got a 
darling wife, 
And she can't live very long on love and homy; 
But there's one thing so fine, 
We've no children so divine, 
Su poverty it don't seem such a 
fetter. 
But on this you may rely, 
There will come some by- and-bye— 
Well, I 
think the less I 
say of it the better.

ROMANCE. 
" 
W HAT is the use of arguing, Ned ? 
When a 
fellow reaches my age, 
lie generally knows what he's talking about ; 
So I 
tell you I'm book'd for the 
stage.' 
I've seen a 
great deal of it at home and abroad, 
It has long been the wish of my heart ; 
One has hardly a 
care, and there's nothing to do— 
Except, p'eaps, to study a 
part. 
Then, there are the fellows—such jolly dogs ! 
No better boys under the sun !— 
All full of frolic from morning till night, 
And always the first in all fun. 
Then think of the ladies, the dear little pets ! 
In their presence to act what a 
treat ! 
When you rescue the maid from the toils of the wretch, 
You hear them exclaim, 
Oh, how sweet 
And think of the glory when the curtain descends, 
And the loud, swelling plaudits are heard ; 
I 
can almost imagine I'm an actor at once, 
Playing—well—` King Richard the Third.' 
Have I 
ever essayed? 
Well, rather, I 
guess ; 
You mustn't quite think me a 
dunce : 
I 
played 
1Valsinghatu Potts ' in 
Trying It On,' 
At 
Private Theatricals' once." 
REALITY. 
" 
Please talk common-sense, Frank, and not like a 
fool , 
Remember you live among men ; 
Come down from your trip to the skies, my dear boy, 
And seek terra firma again. 
The theatre, your haven, where, as you may think, 
Enjoy themselves every one must ; 
Though flooded with light and beauty in front, 
Behind is but tinsel and dust. 
Do you think we poor actors are free from all care, 
And are always ( as on the stage) gay ? 
No matter how ill, or heavy at heart, 
We must laugh, or we forfeit our pay. 
Of glory you spoke, and loud swelling applause, 
But there's one little thing that you missed ; 
Suppose your success of a 
different kind, 
And instead of 
bravos,' you are hissed 
Now, Frank, learn this lesson, and try to be wise, 
So in future you ne'er may be told 
Two sides to a 
story,' or, as we have heard, 
All that glitters, dear boy, is not gold."

BEHIND THE SCENES. 
By GEORGE HOEY. 
NED, you're going to join the profession, I 
hear; 
Now, hark to a 
word of advice, 
From one who was born in a 
theatre, 
And has lived your short life over twice. 
Pray don't let the tinsel attract you, 
For that, you must know, is the crust, 
To make it look bright to the every-day world, 
While the apple inside is but dust. 
Here, where we stand, is the theatre's back door, 
The play is just over within,— 
What a 
pity it is that some people think 
That door is the portal to sin ; 
And that every poor actress, or actor the same, 
Who toils on the stage for her bread, 
Is an outcast from all that is holy and good, 
Aad had better by far to be dead. 
But follow me now to that small world within, 
And dodge round the " wings " and the " fiats," 
Though take care of your clothes, for it's dusty back here, 
And these stairways are hard ones on hats ; 
So look where you step, mind the numberless traps, 
And shortly I 
think you will say, 
That theatrical life is more than a 
song, 
And an actor's more than mere play. 
Now we stand on the stage, how dreary it looks, 
When stripped of its gorgeous attire ; 
And only this great giant serpent of hose 
In wait for its enemy—fire. 
Look out in the front, where a 
short time ago, 
Sat the audience joyous and gay, ( 
Now there is nothing but gloom, and the place 
Seems best suited for some ghostly play. 
There, at the back, are crowded the scenes, 
The " throne," you perceive, is but gilt; 
The " palace," but canvas, the exotics rare, 
Are but paper, they never can wilt. 
(1) 
BEHIND THE SCENES.—Concluded. 
The great chandeliers are let down by a 
rope, 
And the gasman alters the " moon," 
It all may look tine, I 
daresay, from the front, 
Back here the bright picture fades soon. 
Now look at the actors; first comes the" star," 
While his servant man carries his bag ; 
Next the " Comedian," weary and sick, 
Who can scarcely his limbs with him drag; 
The devil disease claims him for his own, 
As is seen by his figure so spare, 
And yet as you laughed at him during the play, 
You'd have thought he had never a 
care. 
There goes a 
poor ballet girl just from the stage, 
Though in tatters and rags is she now, 
You never would think that she is the girl 
Who a 
short time ago made a 
bow 
To an audience full of enrapture untold 
At her dancing that ne'er was surpassed ; 
Her tinsel is changed for that faded plaid shawl 
That protects her fair face from the blast. 
Look there at your feet, that black yawning ditch 
Where you'd think to see spirits appear, 
Is where not long ago the orchestra sat, 
While their music delighted the ear ; 
Now look up above to the " borders" and " flies," 
Now bear bow the echo rebounds ; 
The only thing moving outside of ourselves, 
Is the watchman pursuing his rounds. 
Yes, there is, as you say, a 
much brighter side, 
For some have grown rich by their art ; 
But I 
don't think there's one who has been on the stage, 
Who would not feel sick at his heart, 
If a 
daughter or son should follow his steps; 
So, Ned, boy, just take my advice, 
And before you determine to follow this life, 
Rememb.,n‘ this scene, and . think twice.

RE ALWAYS UP AND DOING, 
BOYS. 
A.s sung by Grs W ILLIAMS. 
The Music of this song is published by WitiTE and GOULLAUD, 86 Tre-
mont street, Boston, Mass. 
Price 35 cents. 
LIFE and its cares are a 
burthen 
To those who hug closely the load ; 
Stout hearts must shoulder the knapsack, 
And never look bac% on the road. 
Steer your course with care and caution, 
The deep river noiselessly rolls ; 
To have health on your side is a 
blessing, 
The greatest that Dame Fortune doles. 
Let's be up and doing, boys, 
Always up and doing ; 
" 
Forget, forgive," your motto be, 
Always up and doing. 
Unfurl the old banner of duty, 
Advance at the word of command ; 
To help on the faint heart be ready, 
And by a 
true friend ever stand. 
Esteem not a 
man for his learning, 
Throw Tory and Whig overboard ; 
For work is the true stamp of merit, 
Be your man peasant or lord. 
Let's be up and doing, etc. 
Then fear not when old age steals over 
The work you've so happily done ; 
'Tis only by those who will labor, 
The battles of life may be won. 
Then waste not your days in repining, 
'Tis useless regretting the past ; 
But always be up and be doing, 
To honor and duty hold fast. 
Tien let's be tip and dn7.

MULDOON, THE SOLID MAN. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. H. HARDING, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. HARDING, 288 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price 10 cents. 
Wfitten and sung by En. HARRIGAN in his popular sketch of" Who owns 
the Clothes Line ? " 
I 
Am a 
man of great influence, 
And educated to a 
high degree, 
I 
came here when small from Donegal, 
In the Daniel Webster, across the sea; 
In the Fourteenth Ward I 
situated, 
In a 
tenement house with my brother Dan ; 
By perseverance I 
elevated, 
And went to the front like a 
solid man. 
CHORUS . 
Go with me and I'll treat you dacent ; 
I'll set you down, and I'll fill the can ; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man." 
At any party or any raffle 
I 
always go as an invited guest; 
As conspicuous as General Granite, boys, 
I 
wear a 
rosebud upon my breast; 
I'm call'd upon to address the meeting, 
Without regard to clique or clan ; 
I 
show the constitution with elocution, 
Bekase you know I'm a 
solid man. 
CHORUS. 
For oppositions or politicians, 
Take my word I 
don't give a 
damn ; 
As I 
walk the street each friend I 
meet 
Says, " There goes Muldoon—he's a 
solid man 
I 
control the Tombs, I 
control the Island, 
My constituents they all go there, 
To enjoy the summer's recreation, 
And the refreshing East river air; 
I'm known in Harlem, I'm known in Jarsey, 
I'm welcomed hearty on every hand; 
Wid my regalia on Patrick's day, 
I 
march away like a 
solid man.

FACES IN THE FIRE. 
By GEORGE bay. 
I'vn oft in boyhood crept up to the fire 
And watched the faces fashioned by the blaze, 
Which soon as formed as quickly would retir 
As do the fancies of our younger days. 
And even now, when in mature old age, 
I 
watch the faces as they come and go, 
They form a 
story written on life's page— 
A 
story full of weal and full of woe. 
I 
there have seen my own face as a 
boy, 
All wreathed in smiles, unknown to grief or care, 
Beyond the breaking of some favorite toy— 
A 
face on which its thoughts were all laid bare. 
Look at it now, as left by Time's hard hand— 
For care and sorrow both have made their mark— 
My brow's as withered as you burning brand ; 
My smile e'en pales beside the flickering spark. 
And sometimes faces we have learnt to loathe 
Our fancy shapes beneath our very eyes, 
And dearest friends beside the bitterest foes 
From out the embers steadily arise. 
Oh, if we knew but where to draw the line 
'Twixt loving hearts and hearts as black as night, 
About our lives then fondly would entwine 
Some flowering shrub instead of parasite. 
And oft methought the fire would blaze anew, 
And then a 
group of little faces came, 
Whose beaming eyes have thrilled me thro' and thro', 
Whose smiles outvied the brightness of the flame. 
What man can look on such a 
happy scene 
And feel no pride or joy within him rife 1 
Such little faces gathered there are e'en 
Thu stepping- stones in every father's life. 
And then a 
brighter face than all the rest 
Would lovingly look up from out the blaze, 
And make me think that all my life was blest, 
In having one so good to cheer my days. 
For, though from clime to clime a 
man may roam, 
He finds how dreary soon becomes his life, 
Without a 
purpose and without a 
home, 
Without a 
faithful, true, and loving wife. 
And so I 
often wheel my easy chair 
Toward the bright and ever cheerful blaze, 
And hour by hour I 
sit before it there, 
And think upon my boyhood's joysome days. 
So will my children do when I 
am gone, 
1.7 r 
t.h 
tame fancy they will soon acquire, 
And oftoa sit until , ii-

mont street, Boston, Mass. 
Price 33 cents. 
THE other night I 
went to 13,3, 
In fact I 
often do ; 
And in my sleep went down to the deep, 
Wii(,re a 
strange world met my view. 
This world was called Concordia, 
Its people gay and free ; 
I 
wished that I 
was one of them, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain as plain could be; 
They were oh so content, they never paid rent, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Their food, and drink was pure and not 
Adulterated stuff; 
They'd no " Good Tem-
stars," for they knew 
When they'd just had enough. 
They'd no " blues " partial to " running in," 
No Divorce Court had they got ; 
And they'd never read the " Englishman," 
0! they were a 
happy lot.

This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain as plain could be, 
They'd never had an odger nor claimant " Sir lodger," 
Nifty wiles under the sea.

FIFTY MILES UNDER THE SEA.—Concluded. 
They'd never had a 
National debt, 
They never were troubled with wars ; 
They never had. a 
man for the rates 
Come " knock, knock, knock," at their doors. 
The toothache, income tax and corns 
They knew not,--happy souls! 
Of railroad smashes they'd ne'er heard. 
Nor the price of a 
ton of coal. 
CHORUS. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain as plain could be; 
You may doubt my tale, they'd no workhouse nor jail, 
Fifty miles under the sea. 
Never a 
one had been known to dread 
The approach of quarter day, 
The mothers-in-law all lived by themselves 
Ten thousand miles away. 
No " pater 
was troubled with " milliner's " bills, 
Their children ne'er numbered a 
score ; 
You may think it strange, it was wisely arranged 
That each should have two and no more. 
ClIQRC S. 
This is what I 
saw when dreaming, 
As plain as plain could be ; 
I 
then heard a 
knock, " and it's past ten o'clock," 
I 
came up then from under the sea.

Price 10 cents. 
I'm one o' the wicked bruisers 
You hear so much about; 
I'm not afraid of any man, 
Either tall, or short, or stout; 
I 
travel on my muscle, 
And my blows are sure to sting; 
I'm boss in ev'ry tussle— 
I'm a 
hero of the ring. 
(Strikes a 
defensive attitude. 
Pianist! beware! I) 
SPOKILN.—Anybody wants to fight ? 
Here's yer man and 
money. 
I'm a 
hero of the ring— 
Ev'ry blow is sure to sting ; 
Right and left I 
send them in— 
I'm a 
hero of the ring. 
They say I 
am a 
tough ' un, 
And right they are, you bet; 
I'd eat a 
arm as quick as not, 
Without the least regret. 
If ever I 
git cornered, 
I 
make somebody sing; 
They can't begin to scare me— 
I'm a 
hero of the ring. 
SPOKEN.—Dat's what's de matter wid me! and don't you for-
git it. 
I'm a 
hero, etc. 
THE HERO OF THE RING.—Concluded., 
I 
like a 
rough and tumble, 
Or a 
row of any sort, 
Where I 
can show, with every blow, 
Some scientific sport. 
No matter who attacks me, 
My courage don't take wing, 
Till I 
knock some man asunder, 
Like a 
hero of the ring. 
SPOKEN.—Tbat's the kind of a " hickory nut" I 
am. 
I'm a 
hero, etc. 
I 
always " come up smiling," 
" 
First blood" is always mine; 
I'm sure to claim the first knock-down, 
And " peepers" I 
can blind. 
For fight I'm always ready, 
And backers I 
can bring; 
You can bet your bottom dollar 
On the hero of the ring. 
SPOIEEN.—No 
mistake about it, boys. 
I'm solid every time. 
I 
want you to understand that— 
I'm a 
hero, etc. 
I 
hope you all believe me; 
If not, just let me know, 
And when I'm done you'll see some fun, 
The manly art I'll show. 
I'm always in the humor 
To laugh, and fight, and sing; 
Remember what I 
tell you— 
I'm a 
hero of the ring. 
SPOREN.—I 
don't want to raise any disturbance, but if any 
snoozer tries to git around me, I'll say, " Look a 
here, young 
fellar, do you know who I 
am 1" (
very striking altitude.) 
I'm a 
hero, etc. 
LITTLE DARLING, DO YOU MISS ME.

I'LL sing you a 
song of Katrina Hoofmant, 
Who makes sauerkraut, but never go out, 
She lives by her fadder, who weighs just about 
Three hundred and sixty-five pound. 
I

And her fadder he don't like that suit, 
lie ketchecl me one day and my hair he did pull 
Und busted me right of my snout. 
SPOKEN.—But dat Katrina all de time her

Katrina? und I

SHE'S GOT THE MONEY TOO. 
By JOHNNY W ILD. 
Sung in the character of SKY BLUE, in the play of 
Chicago. 
I'm very fond of beauties as any one can be, 
Darling one, the dearest one, I

There's none of them can love them except myself and you, 
For my love she is a 
yaller gal, and she's got the money too. 
CHORUS. 
Oh ! ain't she got the money 7 
Yes, indeed, my honey; 
She is the sweetest flower that sips the falling dew. 
My love she is a 
yaller gal—she's got the money too, 
She takes me out a- riding whenever she comes down; 
She's got the nicest carriage and the fastest horse in town. 
She tells me that she loves me; I 
listen; wouldn't you'? 
My love she is a 
yaller gal—she's got the money too. 
Oh! ain't, etc. 
I'll have a

I'll have the nicest mansion upon the avenue; 
My love she is a

LITTLE darling, do you miss me, 
Wand'ring from your cottage door? 
Do you linger there to kiss me, 
As you did in days before 7 
Is your gentle heart repining 
For the joys that once were thine— 
With my arms around you twining, 
And your little hand in mine? 
CHORUS. 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
As you dream of days before 7 
Do you linger still to kiss me 
By the little cottage door. 
Little darling, do you miss me, 
Roaming by the streamlet tide? 
Where I 
whispered, as I 
kissed thee, 
You were more than all beside 1 
Does sweet memory, returning, 
Bring again those happy days, 
With the never-ending yearning 
For my lips to speak thy praise 7 
Little darling, etc. 
Little darling, do you miss me? 
Do you long to hear my voice 
Breathing words so sweet and tender 
That would make your heart rejoice 1 
By and by I 
hope to greet thee 
As I 
did so long before; 
Are you waiting still to meet me 
As you've done in days of yore 7

YES, my love, we're growing old— 
Silver threads among the gold 
Shine upon our brows to- day; 
Life has lost its blooming May! 
Still your eyes so fondly beam; 
Time flows onward like a 
dream ! 
What though dark the days may be, 
You are always young to me. 
CHORUS. 
Yes, my love, we're growing old— 
Silver threads among the gold 
In our fading locks we see; 
But you're always young to me. 
Days may come and days may go, 
But our hearts will fondly glow; 
For the past we've no regret, 
Since the hour when first we met ; 
Lay your hand in mine once more, 
Every dream of youth restore! 
Still your words are melody; 
You are always young to me. 
Yes, my love, etc. 
Down the hill of life we stray, 
Soon will come the parting day; 
O'er the river dark and lone 
We shall meet again, my own! 
Still we journey hand- in-hand 
To the brighter, better land ; 
In your eyes my heav'n I 
see; 
You are always young to me. 
Yes, my lore, etc. 
POOR UNCLE PETE. 
Words by ED. ItemaroAN. 
On I 
many years ago, away down in Dixie, 
That's when I 
was a 
poor old slave, 
I 
told you that I 
had a 
heap of pleasure. 
Now everything am silent as the grave, 
All the boys that belong to good old rnassa 
Am scatter ' round the country in a 
heap, 
I'm lost, I'm bewildered, I'm dumbfounded, 
Oh, what will become of Uncle Pete ? 
I'm lost, I'm bewildered, I'm dumbfounded, 
Oh, what will become of Uncle Pete 'I 
Poor Uncle Pete, come along, 
Poor Uncle Pete, come along, 
Children now am canine', 
Poor Uncle Pete come along, 
Poor Uncle Pete come along; 
Yes, I 
am coming, 
Yes, he is coming. 
No more will I 
see my good old missy, 
Dey laid her slowly in de clay ; 
She sickened and she withered like a 
flower, 
Yes, from dis weary world she's passed away, 
So I 
roam round here, ' along you strangers, 
And try hard to shuffle wid my feet ; 
I'm crippled, I'm aged, I'm rheumatic, 
What will become of Uncle Pete l 
I'm crippled, I'm aged, I'm rheumatic, 
What will become of Uncle Pete ? 
Poor Uncle Pete, etc. 
'Scuse me, white folks, for dis feeling, 
That flows spontaneous from de heart, 
I ' spect I'll soon cross o'er de river Jordan, 
What. we'll meet again no more to part ; 
But while I 
stay down here among you 
I'll try and please you white folks all a 
heap. 
I'll collapse, I'll go under, I'll expire, 
Dat's what'll become of Uncle Pete l 
I'll collapse, I'll eo under, 
expire, 
Dat's what'll become of Uncle Pete.
