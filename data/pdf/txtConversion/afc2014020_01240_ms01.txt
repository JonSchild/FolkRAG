00:15 Good afternoon, my name is David Mokrezcki. I am 28 years old. My farm is in Hadley 
Massachusetts 
00:30 4th generation tobacco family July 1st right in the middle of the tobacco season. When you can 
wear the weather tobacco grows well. 
00:30 I have always lived on a tobacco farm. 4th generation. My great grandfather started raising 
tobacco in 1903 in Sunderland and Hadley. He and his wife started a sorting shop and had a few acres, 
they’d sort in the evenings and slowly he built up the business till they had about 100 people working on 
over 70 acres in 1920 a big sorting shop. 
1:00 Sorting they go through take the leaf and size it by length, thickness and color, Darks, mediums and 
lights. There are number 2’s which are a thinner leaf. The top dark leaves are the most desirable. The 
buyers are more and more picky now. 
1:35 I worked with my dad and then with my neighbor Jody Zagrodnick. His grandfather raised tobacco 
too.  I started laying laths which is the first job for a young kid. We spear the tobacco on this side of the 
river. It is a spear on the end of a four foot stick. I would carry the laths and lay them down right next to 
the chop pots. Then I started cutting which is cutting the plants with an ax and laying them down and 
did that for a long time. When I graduated high school I was tall enough to hang the tobacco. I could 
reach the poles for hanging. 
2:55 Peak gets pretty hot, no air flow. It is like when you open to an attic in the summer time. I hoed and 
planted. 
3:00 I was running around my grandfather’s sorting shop when I was three years old. We never did 
shade tobacco. Always broadleaf. 
3:45 We used to use our own seed and then we raise seeds from a neighbor the Zomecks’s up the street 
for about five years an old Connecticut strain that has been cultured to be stronger and more resilient, 
thicker and more desirable.  
4:05 I am raising Connecticut three three  (33)  this year, two and a half acres and two acres of a variety 
called B2 variety developed by Jim LaMondia at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. And it 
has genetics in it to fight blue mold and other diseases. If that works well we will probably switch over to 
all B2. For right now I am trying to see what varieties make better wrapper leaves.  
4:50 Once you start farming tobacco you can’t get rid of it. I always enjoy everything. It is hard work, hot 
and dirty. But you can see your progress in a day. 
5:10 It is one of those crops that makes it to the bank but not without high risk. The farmer has to put up 
the money for the insurance, the fuel, raising it, keeping the weeds out, harvesting it, buying fertilizers, 
paper, string, fungicide, building maintenance. All the risk is on the grower.  
5:40 The buyers just come in and buy it if they want it. The growers are looking at uniformity and the 
overall plant. 
6:10 We have conversations about the season, the weather, culturing problems, I show them the crop. 
But if you do sell you can do pretty well.  
6:40 These barns here were built in the 40’s. My Dad’s sheds on the home farm were built by my great 
grandfather in 1938. The hurricane year. One blew over during the hurricanes that year. It was a 15 
benter and it was full of green tobacco. Sept. 29th the hurricane came through. They just moved the 
tobacco over to a shed that was already empty. They cut in late July.  
7:25 They were able to move the tobacco because they sort it on their own they had the luxury to go 
through it and pick out the best leaves.  
7:40 (Dale Cahill: You don’t just sell it, you also grade it, a step you’d pay someone else to do?) 
7:46 Yes, it reduces some costs.  
8:17 (Darcy Cahill: How did you come to work on this farm?) My boss passed away December 3rd 2012. 
Jody Zagrodic. I learned a lot from him and had managed his farm for 8 years and I had an opportunity 
to run the whole place so I seized it and am utilizing my whole degree. 
8:37 I graduated from Stockbridge School Agriculture in 2006 plant and science degree in fruit and 
vegetable crops. So here I am.  
8:469 (Dale Cahill:  It didn’t take you very long to become quite a land owner!)  I didn’t fall too far from 
the main tree I guess.  
8: 48 so do the barns come with the farm? I rent the sheds out I am charged 100 dollars a bent. 800 
dollars for a two acre barn. A good deal. I want to buy the whole farm. 
9:40 ( Darcy Cahill: Any classmates in the same position?) No, not running their own farms. They are 
working with their parents. 
10:00 I do both management and labor. This time of the year it is 7-11 every day. We are off to a good 
start this year. 
10:10 How do you know you are off to a good start? Well, we’ve had tiny rains. It has been more gradual 
so things are growing a bit better.  
10:30 The vegetable yield is already good. I don’t have all my eggs in one basket. We’ve got lettuce, 
snow peas, zucchini, summer squash, asparagus, bell peppers, fall squash, pumpkins, cabbage,  Brussel 
sprouts. Almost all of it, A to Z. the key is cash flow so you can supplement the payroll. I have got to have 
it.  
11:15 The money isn’t going into the bank but it is supplementing my costs.  
11:30 At least half of the tobacco crop will go into the bank. Hopefully. It costs 43-45 hundred dollars an 
acre to raise tobacco with labor. Typical return? You can double it. Back in 2000 during the tobacco 
boom when cigars were really hot they got 10.50 a pound. Now we get 6 to 6:50 if we are lucky. 
12:06 The hard part of farming is that it is out of your control. You always dwell on things. At night every 
time you hear thunder a barn could get hit. A wind could blow it over.  A hail storm could come through. 
The uncertainty of what you are going to get for a price, are they going to buy it, and all your money that 
is tied up. 
12:30 When you do sell it you don’t really get paid. The buyers come by and you sign a contract in 
December, well the contract is there and the price is there but there is no money. You don’t get paid 
until your ship date so all your money could be tied up for a whole year. That’s the hard part. 
12:50 There are no guarantees. It is very nerve wracking especially because I hang every lath myself 
13:10 Last year my dad and I had the most tobacco we’ve had since 1988 we had 22 and a half acres. 
That was a lot of work and just the uncertainty about selling it was crazy. We did make out pretty well. 
13:30 It is high risk, but rewards can be awesome. It starts in April.  
13:45 My favorite barn is number 7 my dad’s barn. It is a ten benter, 16 foot bents, 160 foot shed. But I 
like it because it is built with 10 x10 beams. 
13:55 My great grandfather salvaged the beams from a hat factory that burnt down in Amherst. So the 
beams are from the 1800’s. That is probably why that one stood through those winds of we are talking 
100 plus miles per hour winds. 
14:25 And then another is number one is the first barn built in 1929. Half of it is five tiers high because it 
is built on a hill. You see that a lot of those in Connecticut. They did have excavators! So that one is 
wicked tall in the end you can throw six or eight into that barn. That is pretty nice. If you put five on a 
lath.  
15:00 Thrall has a 33 benter. Football field long. I drive around and look for it.  
15:45 Barn Cities. I saw six twenty benters in a row. Those are perfect.  
16:30 Barns demolished on Day Hill road by Amazon.  
16:45 We have another shed that was built in 1898. My great grandfather bought it. Is all pegged It was 
built on stone. In the 70’s they jacked it up and put it on sona tubes. 
17:10 I do repairs too. We have to. If you have to hire someone, you won’t make it. ( Darcy Cahill: you 
do it all!) I wear a lot of hats!
