Theatre, N. Y. 
I'm over head and heels in love. 
With a 
darling, charming, pretty octoroon, 
Who swears by all the stars above, 
That I 
to church shall lead her soon. 
And oft at night when stars shine bright, 
And the silver moon in beauty shines above, 
We meet and walk, with happy talk, 
hi all the pretty innocence of love. 
Cuonus. 
She's my little ruby (
break) 
And really quite a 
beauty, 
Then come with Inc at sunset to the valley. 
For there at twilight is our trysting tree, 
And there I 
meet the girl I 
hope to marry ; 
I'm sure that yon folks must envv me. 
Of course she's lots of followers, 
That seek her young affections to engage, 
She knows their hearts are hallower 
Than mine, although she's all the rage. 
Her pretty feet are small and neat, 
And then her waltzing is really quite divine. 
Her eyes shine bright like stars at night, 
Quite melt rue with their brilliant dreamy shin°.

SKELETON TWINS. 
ORIGINAL ACT. 
Written by Rom. WORDEN and Sung by NVoRnFS & MACK. 
Oh here we are a 
lively pair 
Of skeleton twins so sad, sir, 
We feel so glad, we never had, 
No mother nor no dad. 
We dance about from day to day 
Until the sun goes down, 
There's a 
band of music in our shoes 
When we arrive in town. 
CHollus. 
Oh yes, we are the twins 
And we never will say die, 
We gets our living on the square, 
We never tells no lies. 
ktie always try to get along. 
We doesn't care two fins. 
We got no home, we've got friends ; 
We'er a 
ceuple of skeleton twins, 
We aome from Alabama 
Just a 
few short months ago, 
Where we uged to pick the cotton, 
And the sugar cane does grow. 
(lst)—I've been in jail. 
(2nd)—And so have I. 
(Both)—We never did nothing wrong, sir. 
(1,57)—They put me in for being too short. 
(2d)—And me for being so tall.

Air—",,St. Patrick's Day Parade." 
You've all heard talk of the Mulligan Guards, 
And the bold Militia Boys, 
And perhaps also of Captain Jinks, 
And other martial joys; 
Of course we're none of these, you see, 
But soldiers good and tried, 
Our rank is high you'll all perceive, 
And we're the army's pride. 
At the tap of the drum away we go, 
Head well up, and heel and toe, 
We're just the men to scare the foe, 
In the Saturday parade. 
Cuonus. 
We're bound to come, with fife and drum. 
And onward march so gaily, 
Eyes right, prepare to fight, 
For fighting that's our trade; 
The servant girls will all turn out, 
To see us tramping bravely. 
With our quick march, as stiff as starch. 
In the Saturday parade. 
When Saturday comes, you'll hear the drums 
A-beating the tatoo, 
Which calls us gallant soldiers forth. 
To face the public view; 
'We're first inspected, next comes drill. 
In which we most excel, 
And then we form for the gallant parade, 
And march off down the hill. 
For off we go—a 
glorious show, 
Marching bravely two by two, 
Enough to scare the bravest foe. 
In the Saturday parade. 
We're bound. etc.

ALL THE WORLD TO ME. 
SONG- 
AND DANCE. 
W ritten by ROBERT N ORDEN, of W ORDEN & MAers". 
! 
I 
know a 
grove of stately poplar trees, 
That whisper in the sunlight soft and low, 
And gently lend their branches to the breeze, 
And often there to meet my love I 
go; 
She greets me with a 
loving smile, 
And welcomes me with voice both low and sweet, 
We sit and talk the while, 
And count the daisies growing ' neath our feet. 
Citoacs. 
She s 
pure as Heaven above, (
break: 
She's all I 
have to love, 
:
break: 
I've sworn by moon and stars that I'll be true, 
Our vows were plighted 'neath the poplar trees; 
And I 
really love her dearly, 
She is all the world to me. 
And when the Summer time has passed and gone, 
And Winter spreads its mantle o'er the earth, 
And the poplar trees are bare and gaunt and wan, 
I'll marry then my pearl of priceless worth ; 
For she has promised to be mine, 
And share with me her future life and love, 
I've pledged her oft in rubs wine, 
Well live as happy as the turtle dove. 
She's pure, etc. 
Way down in good old GeoTgift, 
The place where I 
was born, 
In that rosy, sunny country 
Where I 
used to hoe the corn. 
In childhood's happy moments 
With spirits light and gay, 
I 
long to see my birthplace, 
For I 
couldn't stay away. 
Citonus. 
I'm travelling back, I'm traveling back, 
Fm traveling night and day, oh. 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, 
I'm traveling all the way, 
I'm traveling back to Georgia, for 
I 
couldn't stay away. 
I 
once did love a 
fair one, 
Way down in Dixie's land. 
'Twas there I 
popped the question, 
I 
asked her heart and hand. 
She said her heart and hand were won, 
So from me she did stray, 
My heart is broke and so am I 
But I 
couldn't stay away. 
' 
I'm traveling, etc. 
But since that time she tells me 
The other coon she's shook. 
The pen and ink she took in hand 
And scratched him from her book. 
My name she wrote upon the page, 
Which makes me feel so gay, 
If you won't grieve I'll take my leave 
For I 
cannot stay away. 
By HARRY BENNETT. 
Performed by the MeKEEs, in ANDY MCKEE'S act of " Mischief." 
Travelling through this mighty nation, 
Had to stop at every station, 
The white folks used to call me out, 
To make me sing and dance; 
I'm a 
fourteen hundred dollar nigger, 
I 
know I'll never grow no bigger, 
I 
love to please de white folks, 
Whenever I 
gets de chance. 
Travelling through de cane and brushes. 
I 
never had no tights nor musses. 
Never cooked my oysters, 
'Kase I 
always likes dem raw; 
loves to hear de bells a-ringing, 
And de nigger wenches singing, 
James Girard Joralemon Johnson, 
Just from Arkansaw. 
When I 
was a 
pickaninny, 
I 
eat so much it made me skinny, 
I 
used to hoe de corn by day, 
And hug de gals at night; 
Then I'd set old massa crazy, 
He wooled me when I 
was lazy, 
Den I'd throw my feet so high. 
They'd go clean out of sight. 
I 
never was a 
dandy nigger, 
I 
never tried to cut a 
figure, 
If I 
had too much to say, 
They'd make me hold my jaw; 
Then I'd dance till I 
was dizzy, 
Just to please my good old missy', 
James Girard Joralemon Johnson, 
Just from Arkansaw.

About 20 years ago, 
Early in de morn, 
Outside of Richmond, 
Straight toward the west, 
Where I

And never used to rest.

Feel so good that I 
can't feel sad, 
Now I'm free and I'm so glad, 
Dis am de sport that I

Ever since de time dat I

the lather of a 
family, 
Six girls and one big boy, 
With the neighbors they are friendly 
They are their mother's joy ; 
Ifs every summer evening, 
When the heat would make you droop; 
.Friends there meet from every street 
To gossip on our front stoop. 
There's dainty Misses Grogan, 
Alexander McAfee, 
The undertaker Hogan, 
The pride of Calvary. 
Such splendid vocalization, 
'Twould burst an opera troupe; 
The Sweet By and By would make a 
man die, 
As sung on our front stoop. 
They talk about the Murphys, 
And say they put on style, 
And how their daughter Mary 
Went down to Coney Isle 
With a 
German music teacher, 
Who lined her with clam soup, 
Then they say, don't give it away, 
-
\\-bot you Ilefir on ou fccnt ,swop, 
You'd have to run the gauntlet, 
If ye were walking by, 
They'd have your family history 
In the twinkling of an eye. 
They'd turn you gently over, 
While they sit there in a 
group, 
They'd give to you sweet Ballyhoo, 
While passing our front stoop. 
They send Kate with a 
pitcher, 
For Cincinnati beer; 
Then their conversation 
For a 
mile or two you'll hear, 
They talk about the babies, 
The whooping coughs and croup, 
When the moon's out in sight, they say good night, 
And go home from our front stoop.

Says, " Cheese it, stop! here comes der cop, 
Tie loose der little side door." 
What kind of freedom is dot now, 
Vere you make a

Do you s'pose a

On turkey, beans und pie?

I 
took my girl one day, 
A sailing down the bay, 
And Emma was the darling creature's name: 
While standing on the pier, 
Some chaps at her did stare. 
And one and all around her did exclaim: 
CHORUS. 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
Emma, you put me in quite a 
dilemma: 
Oh! Emma, whoa! Emma, 
That's what I 
hear wherever I 
go. 
I 
asked them what they meant. 
When some one at me sent 
An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye 
Emma began to scream, 
"Oh! Fred, what does this mean?" 
I 
asked again, and this was their reply: 
Oh Emma. etc. 
I 
thought they'd never cease, 
So shouted out " Police 1" 
And when he came he looked at me so sly: 
The crowd then at me laughed. 
And said I 
must be " daft," 
And once again they all commenced to cry: 
Oh! Emma, ete 
An old man said to me, 
" 
NN,

The joke ! " and I 
look'd at him with surprise! 
He said " don't be put out," 
It's a

Aud then their voices seem'd to rend the skies!

Wid Clemintina Consitina 
And my Angemirna Mina May. 
Den we'll balance all to one another, 
Like de ship dat's going round de horn, 
Dar we'll meet you, yes we'll greet you, 
While dancing in the barn. 
As we move so gracefully, we're as happy as can be. 
Den swing your partners all together, 
Kase now's the time for you to learn, 
Music, singing, niggers singing and dancing in the barn. 
Den we's off to work in the morning, 
Singing as we go out to the field, 
Picking cotton, all else forgotten, 
Except to see how much de ground do yield. 
De black folks are happy while together, 
It's funny for to hear them tell a 
yarn. 
About a 
lover wid kisses smother, 
While dancing in the barn. 
As we move, etc. 
MY ONLY FRIEND, 
(Song to the Banjo.) By CHAS. E. 
HELM., 
OLD scenes, take me back on de old pine-wooded track, 
I 
think I 
see de massa's face once more; 
Then there's my good old wife, the main- stay of my life, 
Waiting and watching at de cabin door. 
Yes, memories of the past, old friend, you've woke, at last, 
I'm broken down, and cannot long remain; 
So cheer me, if you can, I'll reach dat better laud, 
And this old man will never more _complain. 
CHORUS. 
Then comfort I 
will take, my heart it cannot break, 
My voice with yours, old comrade, I 
will blend; 
My sorrow's almost o'er, dey's knocking at de door, 
Dis dear old banjo, here's my only friend. 
Hark! what is dat? I 
hear de angels drawing near--
I 
hear dem singing at de cabin door; 
Old massa, he is dat, young misses—young and fair, 
And de liltle nigs, long dead and gone before. 
I 
cannot see to read; I'm helpless now, indeed, 
But my troubles dey will surely soon be o'er; 
kithough I'm broken down, dey's got for me a 
crown, 
Now just wait, 1,11 meet you ou de other shorv.

And at night to some hay-loft they do roam.

There's a 
message from the many, 
From the many to the few, 
Toiling millions ask for justice 
From the rich, which is their due; 
Honest workers toiling, sighing, 
Crowning hearts as true as steel, 
Suffering, starving, groaning, dying, 
'Neath oppression's iron heel. 
CHORUS. 
Then give to the poor 
The' hand of free good will, 
And help your struggling brother 
To climb life's rugged hill; 
Truth makes the man, 
And not his money bags, 
For crime oft stands in broadcloth, 
Whilst honesty's in rags. 
To the rich the poor are step-stones, 
Stepping stones to fortune's dower, 
•,, 
klikr grinding down their wages, 
Up they mount to wealth and power; 
Oh, ye purse-proud sons of mammon, 
Whilst you o'er your riches gloat, 
Don't forget that honest people 
Often wear a 
ragged coat. 
My beloved brothers and sisters and constituents, allow me' 
to call your particular attention to the great fact thst is now 
agitation de public mind; if so, why not? can any man say 
otherwise, eh? 
This subject dat I 
am about to expound, my 
demoralized fellow-citizens and students, is that of inflation. 
If 
you get a 
Webster's unabridged spelling-book, and turn over 
the leaves, you will find something printed on them, and that 
something is the word inflatiou—blown up. 
Can any man say 
otherwise? well, if so, why not, eh ? 
'Tis a 
subject that touches 
every one that stands under-
neath the folds of that glorious, ever- waving, star-spangled 
smasher, and reaches from the finest ladies in the land, inflated 
with her own beauty and the blood of youth, to the third-class 
politician, whose majestic soul soars Into the realms of hash and 
fish-balls, snd thereby he is inflated by them. 
Now instead of calling a 
man a common drunkard, we oall 
him a 
universal inflationist. 
But where are we now ? for, if so, 
why not? 
Can any man say otherwise? 
Therefore, let us 
have plenty of it, and more too. 
I 
think as I 
stand here I 
can 
produce an argument that will convince you that a 
five dollar 
greenback is even better than a 
five dollar gold piece. 
Now, for 
instance, if a 
man has a 
five dollar gold piece, and it belongs to 
him, what does he do with it ? 
Why he puts it in his pocket, 
and if he takes it out a 
year hence, what does he find it? Why 
a 
five dollar gold piece still. 
Now if a man has, on the other 
ham-, 
a 
five dollar greenback, and he goes to put it in his pock -
et, he doubles it, so to illustrate—don't he? and if be takes it 
out in five minutes after, he finds it in-creases! 
Can any man 
say otherwise? 
Well, if so, why not ? 
But, for gracious sake, 
don't tell my mother-in-law that I 
said it, or there wolild be war 
in my domicile.

Sweet visions of childhood, how bright they appear 
When our lives are o'erclonded with care; 
How fondly we dream of them year after year, 
And how lovely they are and how fair. 
Oh. bless'd are the scenes I 
ne'er can forget: 
Dearest mother so kind and so true; 
Sweet home that I 
left with the saddest regret, 
How my heart fondly turns unto you. 
CHORUS. 
Sweet visions of childhood return to me now, 
And I 
weep for the days that are past; 
My fond mother's kiss and her hand on my brow, 
In the days that were too bright to last. 
Sweet visions of childhood, how dear to each heart, 
Once again by a 
fair mother's knee 
I 
linger while fast welling tears fondly start, 
And the past comes in beauty to me. 
Oh, time may destroy all the bright joy of life. 
But this bosom will ever retain 
Lovely visions of thee, 'mid the world's busy strife, 
Bringing bliss to this fond heart again. 
Sweet visions, Scc.

She is lovely as a

Her eyes are bri,!ht, her step is light,

Just as happy as a

Oh, don't you wish that you was me, 
Such a 
pretty little girl to spark, 
With eyes so bright they shine at night 
Like diamonds in the dark, 
And she's accomplished too, you bet, 
There's nothing she can't do, 
And a 
style I 
declare, there is none to compare.

The theatre was full, and so were the actors, 
Dan Dorkins was going to appear 
That night in a 
barefooted slack- wire clog, 
For he was the Pompey round here; 
The bar-room was fearfully crowded with boats, 
Who awaited a 
pleasant surprise, 
For they knew they would eat 
When the lunch was set out, 
And they longed for the curtain to rise. 
The curtain arose, and so did the people, 
Who began to shout and hurrah; 
Dan Dorkins came out with young Oliver Twist, 
But they gave him the laugh and yah! yali! 
The play it began when the curtain went up, 
But something was wrong I 
felt sure, 
" 
He's away off his base," says John James Mansfield, 
That never went back on the poor; 
A brick—well it was—I 
saw Dorking start, 
And carom on the dark red for two, 
And it made metfeellthirsty to see how he worked. 
But continually dropping his cue. 
He says, "I'm the king !" when a 
woman jumped up, 
Cried, " You lie, for you're one of the gang, 
And you owe me for washing." 
That knocked Dorkins cold, 
And his head on his breast did hang. 
At length the footlights he approached with a 
rush, 
And " Ladies and gentlemen," said, 
If I 
haven't drank enough bourbon to-night, 
The fault is my wealth, not my head. 
Many a 
time I 
have made yon all sick, 
And get up and go out for a 
beer.

mile in a 
week, 
How I 
wish Dan O'Leary was here.

THE HERALD COMPLAINT BOOK. 
A new idea for a 
song, taken from the column in the N. 
Herald, called the " Complaint Book," written by TONY 
PASTOR, and sung by PRANK LEWIS. 
The hit 
of the season at the Academy 
of 
Music, 
Pit tsburg. 
Of course in search of novelties are people now-a- days. 
New subjects they are sure to find in novels, songs and plays: 
But if in search of something new, you only have to look 
And read the various grumbles in the Herald "Complaint 
Book." 
gPOKEN.—This is from a 
gentleman who takes his meals out— 
Mr. Editor, in the restaurant where I 
make my daily calls, 
fonnd an India rubber shoe in one of my codfish balls; 
Now, will I 
sue the proprietor, or will I 
punch the cook ? 
Or will I 
show the rascal up in the Th9-01(1 " Complaint Book ?" 
SPOKEN.—In 
regards to the stage— 
There's a 
question I 
would like to ask, aud an answer I 
expect. 
Why Mabel Leonard from the stage they forcibly eject? 
While the ragged urchins on the street they quietly overlook, 
Our Commissioners should look after them. 
Put that down on 
the book. 
SPOKEN.—From a 
respectable married lady— 
I've been married now five years or more, and have neither 
kith nor kin, 
And in the shape of a 
family there's nothing yet been seen; 
While Mrs. Jones, across the way, on a 
pair of twins can look, 
Won't some one stir my husband up in the Herald " Complaint 
Book ?"

In your path through life each day, you will meet upon the 
way, 
Fellow mortals upon whom this world cloth frown, 
Who, from poverty or crime, have fallen in their time, 
Or by circumstances crushed and striken down; 
Young men with blighted names, who once had noble aims. 
Young girls with shame and sorrow on their brow, 
Whom a 
kindly word might save, from a dark. dishonored 
grave. 
While a 
cruel one would drive to madness now. 
They were once to some one dear, so don't pass them 
ith a 
sneer. 
But speak a 
kindly word in cheering tone; 
You know not what's in store, for the loved ones you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own. 
The shop girls on the street, with as much respect should meet. 
As the millionaire who in his carriage rolls, 
And the honest laboring man, with his strong and horny hand, 
They too have hearts and feelings—yes, and souls: 
Their family is as dear to them as any here. 
Though their clothes may be all ragged, torn and old, 
Dejected and forlorn, yet, still their hearts are warm, 
Though they lack the rich man's cheerful home and gold. 
They are all to some one dear, so don't pass them with a 
jeer, 
But speak a 
gentle word in soothing tone; 
You know not what's in store, for those whom you adore, 
Remember you have children of your own. 
Don't despise the wretched poor, whom perhaps grim want 
may lure, 
To steal the bread their starving children crave, 
Be not the one to blame, you yourself would do the same, 
With starvation at your door you'd dare the grave; 
And the wretched drunkard, too, who perhaps was once like 
You, 
Respected and beloved by one and all, 
Who no doubt through care and strife. or some sorrow of their 
life. 
Have fallen, but not quite beyond recall. 
And the poor outcast forlorn, don't pass them by with scorn, 
But speak unto them in a 
gentle tone; 
Perhaps they're not to blame for their lives of sin and shame, 
Remember you have children of your ONVII. 
THE MINSTREL'S DREAM. 
An original song, as sung by FRANK LEWIS with immense 
success. 
One eve while sitting ia my chair before my fire so bright, 
Its rays dispelled the midnight gloom, and lightened up the 
night, 
My thoughts reverted to the past, and brought before my gaze, 
The shadowed forms of minstrels great, the kings of by-gone 
days; 
I 
saw the people laugh and cry, as alternately they gave— 
The merry pun, the mirthful joke, the ballad sweet and grave, 
They formed a 
quaint procession, as they passed before my 
sight, 
The minstrels of our former days, thus conjured from the night. 
I 
saw George Christy shake the bones, sweet music from them 
drag, 
Arid how the audience it would roar, as he told each merry gag, 
Saw " Daddy " Rice in ecstacy, those legs of his to throw 
The father of the minstrels—he who danced the first " Jim 
Crow 
Heard Mulligan, with towering form, pathetic ballads sing, 
When Long John opened once his mouth, ' twas down the house 
he'd bring, 
Stevie Rogers gave his excelsior clog, the greatest ever seen, 
And other well-known faces came to fill my minstrel's dream. 
Nelse Seymour showed his giant form, and passed me by and 
A 
friend to every one in need, the minstrel's favorite child, 
I 
iz1V 
How oft I've heard his merry laugh, as he made the night pass 
o'er, 
Give out the joke which ever set the audience in a 
roar; 
He scarcely disappeared when came the minstrel king and 
man, 
The glory of the boys in black—the merfriaughing Dan, 
As Bryant passed ine by, his face with radiance seemed to 
beam, 
lie cast a 
brilliant halo upon my minstrel's dream. 
Young Jerry, of the Bryants, too, with bones and tamborine, 
Recounted every great success in minstrelsy he'd seen, 
Billy Manning, of Chicago fame, then passed me swiftly by, 
And Unsworth gave his great stump speech, in which he the 
world defied; 
Jimmy Bradley danced his unequalled jig, familiar to us all, 
Billy Pastor sang his comic songs, and was many times recalled, 
Eph Horn, the last bright face I 
saw, he threw a 
radiant gleam 
Upon the spirits who had gone to fill my minstrel's dream. 
As sung by Gus. W ILLIA.ms. 
published and Copyright by FRED'K BLUME, 27 Union 
Square. 
When I'm dead and gone from you, darling, 
When I'm laid away in my grave, 
When my spirit has gone to heaven above, 
To him who my soul will save. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I 
ask of you, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Clionus. 
Oh, the days will conic to you, darling, 
When on earth no more I'll be seen, 
One sweet little wish, darling, grant me, 
See that my grave's kept green. 
Will you keep me, love in remembrance, 
When the voice of chiding is heard, 
When other's may speak in censure or blame, 
Speak not one unkindly word. 
When you are happy and gay once more, 
Thinking of the days that have been, 
There's one little wish I

My heart was filled with pain, 
Oh, take me to that good old home,

Shure I'm a 
man that's learned and grand, 
As any in this land; 
But then I've had a 
sad downfall, 
And the blow I 
cannot stand, 
For Margaret Jane, my oldest girl, 
Has lately run away; 
Wid Brignolia she's gone to sing— 
She's the star of the operia. 
CHORUS. 
She can sing in the key of forty-three; 
She's a 
voice like a 
young blue jay; 
She's as fine and grand as any in the land. 
Now she's gone wid the operia. 
I 
thought to fetch her back wid me, 
Till the place where I 
was born, 
For to wed a 
Prince or an Irish Duke, 
And she laughed at me wid scorn; 
She called me " Old Scully," and " Stab his ribs,' 
Told me go hire a 
dray, 
Pull down my chin, wipe oft my vest, 
And come to the operia.

THE RUE DE MULBERRY, 
By ED. HARRIGAN. 
With calm deliberation, 
Without any hesitation, 
I'll give a 
recitation 
Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
From every Gothic winder, 
You can observe its splinder, 
'Tis my duty to defind her— 
The Rue de Mulberry. 
Its buildings are tremendous, 
The population is stupendous, 
The citizens conscientious— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Men from Italiana 
Play harps and the planner, 
In a 
Lazeroner manner, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
Policemen from headquarters, 
Watch Italy's fair daughters, 
And the lager-beer importers— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
You could hear an Irish lecture, 
From the neighbors living next yer, 
In the splendid architecture 
Of the Rue de Mulberry. 
For pugilistic demonstration, 
Of men from every nation, 
The only real location 
Is the Rue de Mulberry. 
'Tis there the solid voters 
Eat eels and Yarmouth bloaters, 
And wear piccadilly chokers— 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
The perfume of the flowers, 
In the bucket shops and bowers, 
Waft their fragrance af all hours, 
In the Rue de Mulberry. 
For vast accumulation 
Of a 
mighty aggregation, 
No other congregation 
Equals Rue de Mulberry. 
On Sundays, then, the ladies, 
ri king out their day days, 
With a 
hundred million babies, 
In the Rue de Mulberry.

EYES OF SPARKLING- BRIGHTNESS, 
ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
Written and sung by the GIRARD BROTHERS. 
Those eyes of sparkling brightness, 
how they haunt us in our dreams, 
They're as bright as flowing ripples, 
Beneath the sun's bright beams ; 
Like dew-drops on the meadow, 
At morning's dawning hour, 
We feel within our heart and soul, 
Love's own sweet magic power. 
Over vale and mountain, (
sym.) 
Violets and fountains, (
sym.) 
Then we'll sing the praise of summer days, 
Of eyes that sparkle bright, 
Through weal or woe. where'er we go, 
They fill us with delight. 
When the nightingale is singing 
Her songs upon the lea, 
We hear sweet voices ringing, 
Of nature gay and free; 
When the sun shines on the river, 
And the shadow's on the hill, 
We'll dream of thee though far away, 
Those eyes will haunt us still. 
Over vale, etc.

With beaming smite our time beguile, 
We are always blythe and gay.

For it will make you glad; 
In the golden rays its shadow it will mock you, 
And whirl and dance like mad. 
When sunset's come, and day is done, 
And darkness claims her right, 
We'll go to rest, and the blest, 
The rays of morning light.

We are two senators, you see, 
And know just what we're doing, 
Pray tell me where that sound came from ? 
Some trouble must be brewing ; (

Now for this time you must excuse, 
But don't make a 
repetition, 
Or else to pardon we refuse, 
And sacrifice position. 
(Waltz time) For yes, we are two senators, 
Swells of the fashion, you see, 
You'll seldom find two figs like us, 
Stylish colored senators are we. 
A 
collegiate education we've had, 
Since our emancipation, (

Although we have our fun at times, 
We dont forget our station. (

DELICATE NUMBER ONE. 
Written for and sung by PEASLEY & HUGHES. Words by 
GEORGE S. 
KNIGHT. 
Music by FRANK CARDELLA. 
Some people talk of being fat, 
And others that they're thin, 
Some show their muscle and all that, 
But with we they can't begin; 
To blow about every thing they have, 
Is what we've never done, 
But where's a 
nig can sling a 
shoe 
Like this delicate number one. 
CHORUS. 
They're only number one, 
Don't think them any more, 
All colored men must vacate, 
When we come in de door: 
When we say one you must not think 
That we mean one in size, 
But one whole ox right by himself, 
We never tell no lies; 
We're never careless with these pets, 
We wear them all the year, 
For when there's one gets busted up, 
There dies another steer. 
They're only, etc. 
I 
am growing old and feeble, 
My hair is turning gray; 
My limbs are weak and painful— 
Are stiff, and won't obey. 
My dancing days are over, 
My pleasures are all gone ; 
For goodness, not for greatness, 
You'll miss me when I'm gone. 
CHORUS. 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone, 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
When I'm gone, you will miss me ; 
There is one kind heart will miss me, when I'm gone. 
What will you do without me 
When Winter time comes on? 
Who'll fold their arms around you, 
As I 
have often done ? 
Who'll hug you, and caress you, 
When I 
above have flown ? 
You'll know where you can find me, 
But you'll miss me when'm gone. 
When I'm gone, &c. 
FACTORY BOY. 
Written for JOHNNY W ILLIAMS by ED. HARRIGAN. 
Prom dear old Albion's shore. 
It's lately I've come o'er, 
To try to gain my fortune and a 
name; 
From old Manchester town, 
Where I've rattled up and down, 
And put the other factory boys to shame. 
With a 
pair of wooden shoes, 
Which hard knocks never bruise, 
After working hard all day I've danced away with joy, 
And the neighbors out to ride, 
Would stop at the old roadside, 
Admiring the nimble touches of this jolly factory boy. 
When I 
get through my meal. 
I'd use my toe and heel, 
Just only to settle my dinner down, 
Then away to work I'd wing 
When I'd hear the mill bell ring, 
No livelier lad for many miles around. 
One day I 
took " French leave" 
And I 
really do believe 
I 
will make my fortune here and a 
happy life enjoy; 
I 
was born to good luck, 
And I 
know that I 
have pluck, 
And I'll try to deserve it like a 
jolly factory boy.

rank high— 
Two privates, yes, two privates ii the N. G. S. N. Y. 
And our foes they tremble when they read our motto, which 
is, Never Say Die. 
For we are two gallant privates, in the N. G. S. N. Y. 
Cnonus. 
We are privates, bold, of the N. G. S. N. Y. 
Two warriors bold to the wars we never fly ; 
With our gay and martial air we attract all the fair, 
In the N. G. S. N. Y. 
[Repeat. 
At balls and parties they do admire us, gay old privates 
two; 
The ladies smile as we pass by, and ask us how do we do; 
As through the Avenue we do drive, the people they all 
do cry 
At us, two gallant privates of the N. G. S. N Y. 
We are two privates, &c. 
Now we'll hid you all adieu, its time we were away, 
The bugle sounds, the Captain calls, of course we must

We are only privates now, you know, and say that with a

BIG-FOOT SAL, 
Banjo Solo. 
Written by J. L. FREENY, expressly for JAMES D. 
ROOME, Banjoist. 
The gal that I 
will sing about, 
Is very fond of me 
Around the waist she's very stout, 
And stands about ten foot three. 
Her foot is a 
tremendous size— 
She wears number twenty-two; 
Her ears are like an elephant's, 
And she walks like a 
kangaroo. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, big-foot Sal, she's the gal, 
That's known by everyone; 
She can waltz on her ear, and drink lager beer, 
And she weighs about five ton. 
She can sing, and play the old banjo, 
At that she can't be beat; 
And dance the light fantastic toe, 
With her tremendous feet. 
Her mouth resembles a 
railroad tunnel; 
She presents a 
terrible sight; 
Her hand would cover an acre of ground; 
Like a 
bull- dog she can fight. 
Oh, big-foot Sal, etc. 
She went to a 
ball the other night, 
And what do you think she done ? 
To raise a 
muss, she put out the light, 
Then took to her heels and run. 
The gals did scream, the men did shout, 
To catch that crazy gal; 
But there wasn't a 
man with pluck enough, 
To tackle big-foot Sal. 
Oh, big-foot Sal, etc.

INCREASE OF CRIME. [Parody.] 
Composed by JERRY COHAN. 
Sung by J. D ROOME. 
Copyright 1877, by A. J. Fisrma, 98 Nassau Street, New York. 
I 
have recently been indulging in profound meditations, 
And the result of my reflections it is difficult to express, 
I 
have pondered on unreasonable individual contemplations 
Regarding our nation's tendency to multiply misdemeanors; 
Uncle Samuel ejaculates 'tis extremely enigmatical 
And decidedly beyond my utmost comprehension. 
I 
would forfeit a 
diminutive consideration to derive information, 
Why progress of criminal license should demoralize our terra 
firma 
Together with peaceful inclinations, we have an unlimited 
amount of bullion; 
Our saving institutions require no pecuniary replenishing, 
We could purchase entire, the elements, according to informants, 
And still there's an increase of crime. 
Uncle Samuel there is truth in your singular conclusions, 
The tempter is infinitely difficult to successfully overcome; 
Behold the laboring portion of our female community, 
Exacting their utmost endeavors to sustain existence; 
Can you express astonishment at the occasional degradation. 
When penurious proprietors unfeelingly proffer 
Insufficient means to allay a 
destitute condition; 
In poverty a 
female would expire without lucrative assistance. 
Preserve our female manipulator of needles, most Omnipotent, 
Her sensibilities are refined and correspondingly sensitive 
As vain female cosmopolitans of gigantic arrogance 
Uncle Sam can you wonder at crime.

How she wept when last we parted, 
How her heart was filled with pail, 
When she said, " Good-bye, God bless you; 
We may never meet again." 
CHORUS

And ere long I'll turn my footsteps 
Back towards my dear old home.

As sung by HARRIGAN lz HART. 
(Air— " 
Gliding Down the Stream.") 
One year ago my Willie 
Gently took a 
sail, 
As far as Blackwell's Island, 
He couldn't find no bail; 
He'd been h'isting sour mashes, 
Till he got on too much steam, 
In a 
Bellevue ferry vessel, oh 
Be glided up the stream. 
CHORUS. 
Gliding up the stream, 
Oh I 
how the snoozers scream, 
With bums afloat on a 
Bellevue boat, 
It's a 
ten day dizzy dream; 
Gliding up the stream, 
To wear a 
suit of Jean, 
Oh I 
what a 
gawk, to leave New York, 
And go gliding up the stream. 
They put him in the baker's— 
My Willie pure as snow, 
And made him count the raisins, 
And stamp down all the dough; 
They cut his curly ringlets, 
Yes, shaved his head off clean, 
To make him look respectable, 
After gliding up the stream. 
Gliding up, etc, 
When Will came from the prison, 
He floated in a 
tank, 
He landed in Astoria, 
OR 
Long Island's grassy bank; 
He fell down on his benders, 
So bad his eye did gleam, 
Saying, " You'll never catch-ee me no more-ee, 
Gliding up the stream," 
Gliding up, etc. / 
Written by JERRY KENNEY, and sung by HARRY W OODSON, at

Oh, listen to the words 
Of a 
poor old colored man, 
Whose heart am filled with misery and woe; 
And a 
story I 
will tell, 
That you all do know full well, 
Of them cruel, cruel days of long ago. 
in dear old Tennessee, 
I 
lived so happily, 
The thoughts do make my old heart feel sore; 
When I 
think of days gone by, 
The tears come to my eyes, 
Them tyrannizing days before the war. 
CHORUS. 
Them cruel days am gone, 
Let us pray both night and morn, 
That they again may never come no more; 
In my memory it am new, 
The sufferings we went through, 
In them tyrannizing days before the war. 
I 
remember wel!, I 
know, 
It am very long ago, 
When I 
used to sit around my cabin home; 
With my children around my knee, 
They would play so merrily, 
Until that woeful bitter day did come. 
The vc
.,hite man came one day, 
Took my little ones away, 
Oh 1 
can it be I'll never see them any more ? 
It's taken then were we, 
And sold into slavery, 
In those tyrannizing days before the war. 
Them cruel days, etc. 
My companions are no more, 
They have gone unto that shore, 
And their journey through this life now am done; 
They will find that all am love, 
In that happy land above, 
In that bright and blessed peaceful happy home. 
But always we will pray— 
Yes, every night and day, 
That them cruel times may come no more; 
For our sufferings they were great, 
HON." terrible our fate, 
In those tyrannizing days before the war. 
Them cruel days, etc,
