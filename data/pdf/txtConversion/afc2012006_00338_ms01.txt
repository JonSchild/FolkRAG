Born in Houston, TX in 1952. Mother's side of the family escaped the potato famine in 
Ireland. Father's family fled from Germany. Established the Corgey liveries stable. Went 
to work at the waterfront after the liveries business died out. Have two uncles that worked 
cotton warehouses. Grandfather was also on the docks. Father was a longshoreman. 
Brother is a Houston pilot. Two sons shipped out as sailors. Always around the 
waterfront. Family and neighborhood everyone worked at the waterfront. Did not 
participate a lot at the waterfront growing up. But seemed to be programmed to take that 
route in life. Formed a large part of personality.  
 
00:05:04 
Was born in a neighborhood close to Pasadena. Was seven years old and was playing in 
the front yard, father came home all excited when he got a job in the union and got fringe 
benefits. Things got better immediately after. Moved to a bigger house, with a two car 
garage and got a second car. Took vacations.                             
 
00:08:00 
college in Southwest Texas. first semester - roommate was life of the party, he wasn't cut 
out for college. Was doing well in school. Old roommate comes visiting in a big car, all 
tan and has a lot of money with him. At around the same time, was doubting time in 
college. Had joined the merchant marine and had been traveling all over the world. Was a 
knee jerk reaction. But went the very next weekend and joined the SIU. Graduated from 
the program at Piney Point. Was hoping to go see the world, but instead was sent to 
Houston to work on tugboat. 5 miles from where he had grown up, and was beginning to 
regret everything. Worked a couple of hitches on the tug. Was basically a deckhand. 
Boring, mundane work. Was fired on third hitch. Joe Perez. Got me a job in the engine 
room. Felt I had found my niche. Got with the chief engineer. Became an oiler. Became 
Chief Engineer. Found it fascinating. Later, got an opportunity to work in the union with 
Perez.  
 
00:18:00 
 
 
Joe was a migrant farm worker who came to Houston as a teenager and worked his way 
to the port. He developed a relationship with SIU. Became elected officer. No place for 
segregation on ships.  
 
00:21:00 
Came on board as an organizer. Tough business. Came back to Houston as a patrolman. 
Meet ships when they come to port, before they pay the crew, rep from the union comes 
down to settle all the grievances. Can settle them 99% of the time. Then they pay the 
crew and we meet and collect dues and conduct union business. From 1980-86. In 86 was 
appointed as port agent. Responsible for administration of the personnel and property of 
port. finances and contract, business manager. Very demanding job. 34 years old. Love 
the waterfront. Became area vice president for the gulf coast in 1990. In 92 as the VP.  
 
00:26:25 
People think Port of Houston is anti union. More unionized than any port in the country. 
Ships, tugs, longshoreman all union. Don't have antagonistic labor relations at all. job to 
mainly negotiate good contracts, promote the port, create jobs, favorable legislation, like 
maritime security program, Jones Act. Try ad get more ships and more cargo. Create 
better opportunities. Labor and management collaborative spirit. One goal - promotion of 
port and industry. Greatest economic success story in the history of the world. Put 
together the first port security plan in the country. POH very progressive and efficient 
port. Value of organized labor. Not only take something from the table but also put 
something on.  
 
00:31:55 
Strike of 68. Came to the industry only in 1973. Losing proposition for all concerned. 
Dad was not involved with it. Industry is constantly changing. School funded by the 
industry. Have stayed ahead of changes. Strike was a watershed event. Earlier had to go 
to the custom house and get two pics and a physical exam. Now, all kinds of training, 
strength and condition training, physical and mental exams. ALmost like signing up to be 
an astronaut and not a merchant seamen. Chose to deal with this. Served for 6 years on 
advisory committee for coastguards. Port security plans - important issues and issues that 
affect the country, has to be fixed but also need to keep commerce moving at the same 
time. Find that very thrilling and rewarding.  
 
00:40:35 
have tremendous respect for US Coastguards. Do so much and receive so little. Not only 
a military org, also law enforcement and regulatory agency. Regulate the whole Maritime 
industry, certifications etc. Very limited budget. Work together for the public good.  
 
00:42:29 
On the board of SIU. Have affiliates - Sailors union of Pacific, Marine Fireman, 
American Maritime officers, etc. Unions that are affiliated to SIU of NA. Mainly 
 
 
represent unlicensed seamen on US flag vessels. Have officer son tugs, and dredges. 
Ferries and manpower affiliated with union helped in the aftermath of 9/11 and helped 
rescue people on board the airplane that made an emergency landing in the Hudson 
River. HQ in Washington DC. Hiring calls from Puerto Rico to Guam. Largest maritime 
union in the USA and represent mariners that work on different types of vessels. Involved 
in community outreach, local politics etc. Have a real sense of ownership after getting 
involved with the SIU. "The merchant marine has always been a place where kids from 
humble beginnings go to be somebody." 
 
00:49:25 
On a ship, the difference between licensed and unlicensed seamen is the same as hourly 
worker and management. Hosepipe. Moving up the hosepipe. Can get license, move up 
the hosepipe and then in the end make a lot more money. 
 
00:55:06 
Grievances. Depends on the type of work. Deep sea ships that run overseas - overtime , 
maybe one employee thinks he is entitled to more overtime than another one. contract 
interpretation. It is not like it used to be Very little drinking out there. Industry has 
changed in a positive way. Don't see misconduct. Now that there are women out there. 
Accident investigation, promotion issues. Last time there was an arbitration was 10 years 
ago. There are grievances but they are healthy.  
 
00:59:20 
The new tugs are like floating spaceships. All computerized. have to have educational 
skills to be in the industry. Back then, all you needed was crude skills and a strong back. 
Now, need science and engineering, computer skills etc are needed. Challenge is to get 
kids interested in science, maths etc. The tendency of people to be honest, straightforward 
and trustworthy is very attractive in the industry. Sailors tend to be honest, courageous 
and trustworthy people.  
 
01:03:50 
Training from high school and college provided no value on the waterfront. Had to start 
from scratch. Skills learnt on the debate team really help everyday.  
 
01:09:30 
Things were best when government, industry and labor are all at the table. In Gulf of 
Mexico, workers don't have a voice. Companies are rabidly anti-union. over there. There 
were real concerns from some of the crew that they wanted to shut drilling down. Mgmt. 
wanted to continue. Hence the oil spill. Have a safety inspector here who goes aboard 
ships and checks everything. Best measure of safety is from people actually doing the 
job.  
 
01:15:45 
 
 
Elections in the union every 4 years. Any member can run for any job provided they are 
qualified for the job. Vote at the end of the year for 60 days so people coming and going 
have an opportunity to vote or request for absentee ballots.  
 
01:17:38 
women in elected, administrative positions. women captains, chief engineer, pilots etc. 
Port agents in number of ports. Women are vital part of this industry. Women are not just 
limited to steward sections they are in every job profile. Women realize they have a good 
opportunity at the port. They work hard and move up. Women seem to be very motivated 
in upgrading their skills and move up the ladder. Don't take it for granted. Don't have to 
make any special changes if there are women aboard a ship. These days everyone has 
their own room.  
 
01:21:14 
Have a son and stepson. Son was 15 and got a little rebellious. Wanted to quit school and 
ship out. Told him it was not a good idea. And needed an education. When he turned 16 
took him down to get papers and got his Z card. This was at a time of Lech Walesa, 
Berlin Wall coming down. Great time to be alive. Put son on a ship. Ship was going to 
Russia with a load of grain. Also had two containers with supplies for an orphanage. At 
destination ship crew became heroes for doing good deeds. Garnered a lot of publicity. 
Came back heroes. Son was overjoyed. Wasn't expecting this to happen. Was not the 
intention. Told him to take another trip. Son got a whole different situation the second 
time around. Ship broke down in Keywest. Had to stay there for three weeks. Came back 
a changed person. Wanted to continue with his education. He went back to college. 
Shipped out every summer. Now in Finance. Getting his MBA and masters in Finance. 
Son bought a pickup truck with the money he earned on the ship. Son was so proud with 
his truck. He left here as a boy and came back as a man. More young people need 
opportunities like that. Did the same thing with stepson. Ended up joining the marine 
corp. Travis is a numbers person and Michael is a people person.  
 
01:34:26 
Very active in the international seafarers movement. Being the top tier maritime country 
with the best jobs and highest wage rates and the best benefits in the world. The 
downside of that is a constant erosion of jobs to foreign flag vessels. 350 ships in the US 
merchant marine. One way to make US more competitive on a global scale is to improve 
the conditions, wages and benefits of the foreign sailors. Work closely with International 
Transportation Federation to do that. Burmese shipman - Shuvey who ran a union from 
his exile in Thailand. Was able to help him when he landed in Houston on a freight. 
Finally got him political asylum. Top performing ITF inspector in the world. He has 
collected $8 million in back wages for foreign seamen in the port of Houston. Great 
American Dream.  
 
01:48:15 
 
 
Has a reputation among seamen as someone who will help and will be there. Port of 
Houston cares.  
 
 
01:50:20 
Tremendous amount of regulations since 9/11. Ground checks more throughly, TWIC 
cards, vessel access. Most progressive and efficient port in the country. We lead by 
example. Has changed the industry a lot. More background checks when trying to obtain 
a merchant marine document. Closer scrutiny. Different going to the airport now. But that 
isn't really a bad thing. Must adapt if you need to survive.  
 
01:55:22 
If anyone wants to go down to the dock, need to get a TWIC card. Costs $130 and need a 
background check done by the FBI. Same background check as when a person gets 
merchant marine papers. So has not been that much of a culture shock.  
 
01:57:40 
(Talks about paintings in the office) Founder of American Maritime Labor Movement. 
ISU - International Seamens Unit. His statement in front of the Congress eventually led 
to the passage of the Jones Act which is the seamen's rights act. US merchant Marine is 
the fourth arm of defense and Jones Act holds it all together. Successors formed Sailors 
union in Pacific. 
 
02:01:15 
First painting is of two harbor tugs docking the Robert E. Lee in Galveston, TX. 
Primarily ran to India and Middle East. (talks about another painting) The paintings were 
done by Captain when he was on tug. Used to sail as chief engineer on those tug boats. 
(Talks about the last painting in room) 
 
02:09:05 
There was a fertilizer ship in TX city. Initial explosion was on the fertilizer ship. Ammo 
ship close to it blew up. Then the refineries close to it. Set off a chain reaction. Close to 
5000 people died in 1947.
