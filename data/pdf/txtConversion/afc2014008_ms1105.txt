Dear Rmeriang:
 
I hope your trip home  from the Conference was not too
 
strenuous;  I was horrified to hear how far you had to go and
 
how many aeroplanes you had to get on and off of.  I myself
 
had a relatively easy flight to Sydney and Auckland with
 
Richard Moyle;  we parted in the Auckland airport,  he for a
 
beach-side vacation with his  family,  me for a tour through
 
New Zealand with my anthropologist daughter,  Naomi,  who flew
 
in later.  I hope Richard's vacation was as pleasant as mine.
 
Naomi's husband,  John Bishop,  is the film maker I mentioned
 
when we were talking in Canberra.  He is  just now in the D.C.
 
area working on some Caribbean festival footage he shot  for
 
the Smithsonian,  and last night we looked at the Palauan
 
dance video.  Actually,  I liked it better this time than the
 
first time  I saw it;  for one thing,  it was  fun to recognize
 
you in the teaching sequence.  You looked so pretty.  Still,
 
this  film is a very long way,  I believe,  from the  film on
 
Palauan dance that could be made.  John agrees with me that
 
its  fundamental problems are the awkwardness of the camera
 
work as well as the overall amateurishness of the  final
 
editing.  It  just  should have been better done.
 
If the money can be found,  John would be happy to work with
 
you on remaking it or reshooting from scratch,  as  far as that
 
goes.  And should you need references to other film makers
 
experienced in shooting in the tropics,  he can provide a few
 
as well.  He has,  by the way,  some film of a dance group on
 
Saipan that he took eight or ten years  ago that you might
 
like to see some time.
 
Anyway,  you can reach John at  8378 Faust Avenue
 
Q
California  91304
 
(FAX 818-704-0642)  if you' re interested in pursuing this any
 
further.  I hope  something can work out.
 
Please give Tina Rehuher my warmest regards and say I missed
 
her at the meeting,  and do let me know if I can ever do
 
anything for you here  in the Washington area.  And maybe some
 
day I will be able to work out a way to visit Palau again.
 
Hey,  are you planning to go to the PacificArts Sestival  in
 
Western Samoa?
 Maybe we'll meet again there.
 
All the best,
