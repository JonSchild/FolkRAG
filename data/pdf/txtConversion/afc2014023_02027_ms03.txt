      Part I 
 
 
Brian Falcon 
0:02 – 0:1:20   Discuss contact information, personal background, ask about schooling 
 
 
 
 
0:34—0:4:12 
 Training (mostly in Redwing, Minnesota), some locally. Move to 
Louisiana, beginning to train – as a kind of apprentice – another music 
repair specialist.  
 
 
0:4:13—7:26 
Continued discussion of training (of Doug) and settling into South 
Louisiana and especially Baton Rouge. Some general comparison 
between music, music education, and education. [Three important music 
instrument repair schools exist, these 2 are associated with Red Wing]. 
Brian notes that he is an employee, but after long employment, has a 
great deal of autonomy in the “shop.” 
 
7: 51—11:39 
Transition begins between discussing gaining training and actually 
performing work on instruments, “cut a bridge,” the interviewer asks, 
“what does that mean.” Following responses deal with varied kinds of 
instruments, kinds of repairs, and types of instrument this shop is likely 
to deal with.

11:41—14:11 
Most of this interview embraced becoming a technician, or working on 
instruments. Here Brian explains for a while the business end. This shop 
has a contract with a local school, and the larger music business (which 
includes the repair facility) “rents” and thus must maintain 800 of its 
own. Brian notes that “kids are something.” He also points out that 
during football season, when bands are especially active, “they bang 
them and tear them up on the field and in the stands…” 
 
14:14—14:22 
Brian returns to doing quite precise repair work on an oboe – he moves 
on to a clarinet; most of the balance of the interview related to this 
instrument and the clarinet in some way or to the needs of precise work 
when repairing musical instruments.  
 
PART 2 
 
Brian Falcon and Doug 
Geiman 
0:00—8:46  Continued discussion and explanation about repair of the clarinet, 
especially talking about the sound holes and replacing the cork pads.  
Brian Falcon 
08:49 
DG interjects that cork finishing can be done with a power lathe. 
Doug Geiman 
08:52—14:30 
Both discussion and display continue as work goes on; cork is glued to 
the barrel of the instrument, and to the keypads. The new cork is 
carefully adjusted. Brian discusses how much work he can get done – a 
lot depends on how much social interaction takes place. The instruments 
are made of different materials. “I don’t see [bugs] tear up the tenon 
corks or the wood bodies. That’s grandilla” pointing to the section of 
instrument tube, “a black hardwood. They’d be hard pressed to eat into 
that. You can see they machine it like metal…”

PART 3 
 
BrianFalcon and Doug 
Geiman 
0:00—8:18 
Speculation about age of the instruments, how they get worn or must 
come in for repair. The repairs can’t really be hurried up – Brian says he 
has a chart, letting people know they can pick 2-out-of-3: fast, cheap, or 
good. You can have any 2, but never expect all 3! If the shop gets any 
complaints, it might be that repairs take too long. DG points to an 
example of a set of small screws, all ripped out, the threats gouged.

The process of gluing, then “sweating off,” and trimming excess adhesive 
is very involved. Brian uses a heat source (an acetylene torch) to soften 
the “keys” and to release the glue – he explains and shows this 
procedure. He also uses an electronic device which “heats” via 
conductivity (a “pad cup heater”). Brian carefully explains the tools he 
uses and Jocelyn notes that each occupation has particular instruments 
… 
BF 
11:34—14:47 
(Side discussion) – both Brian and Doug, while the general conversation 
is about the tools of the trade, step away from their work benches to 
show Jocelyn a unique item: their rare earth magnet (a blockish with 
extraordinary “pull” or attraction to metal) and set of balls of varied 
sizes. They put a particular ball into the cone of a wind instrument and, 
with the rare earth magnet, “pull” it through a dent. In the past, the 
instrument would have had to be un-soldered into pieces, pounded into 
shape –the way an automobile fender is reshaped at a body shop—and 
then reconstructed. With the magnet, many dents are reshaped in-situ. 
BF & 
DG 
14:47—14:56 Return to work benches, finish installing (gluing) and talking about pads 
and sound hole alignment, finishing methods, and details of fine-tuning

PART 4 
 
 
00:43 
BF and DG discuss “screw boards,” which help make the alignment of 
screws in instruments both more accurate and quicker. Brian continues 
to actually work on a cork pad, warming it, letting glue ooze out of the 
edges, cleaning and trimming the pad.  – the interview begins to 
conclude, Jocelyn thanks the respondents, pointing out that there is 
more that could be discussed.
