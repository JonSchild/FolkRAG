Thank you for your letter and gifts for Nick and Eamon. 
I
 
have forwarded the literature to Nick and the tape to Eamon.
 
I know they will be delighted that you thought of them.
 
I only wish I had that extra day for your grandmotherly
 
counsel  I would have loved it!!
 Thank you for your kind and
 
considerate words about my work, but 'work , hardly seems the
 
right word when,  as you say,  you all became my friends. 
I
 
hope we stay in touch despite the miles and that soon we will
 
meet again.
 
I love all sorts of music - any music - infact if truth be
 
told I hear music in many strange and wonderful things.
 
Words will always fascinate me and when wonderful words
 
combine with great music then I know I
'm in the presence of
 
something wonderful and the tingle'  factor sets in. 
I think
 
you'll know what I mean Bess .

I

Smilingly, s

 was unlikely t

c

hat t

When I
