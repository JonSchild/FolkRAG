April 25, 1944, letter from B.A. Botkin to H.M. Bond
April 25, 1944 President Horace Mann Bond Fort Valley State College Fort Valley,
Georgia
Dear Mr. Bond,
Congratulations on the Folk Festival number of the Peachite, which was sent me last
month. The illustrations are most striking and the whole is a valuable contribution to our
knowledge of Negro folk music. I should be pleased to receive any other material you may
have on this year's festival and to know whether you made any recordings.
Sincerely, B. A. Botkin Assistant in Charge, Archive of American Folk Song
