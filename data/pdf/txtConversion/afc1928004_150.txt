OPINIONS OF THE PILE.E.Z. 
OF MR. GUS WILLIAMS' PERFORMANCES. 
After having appeared nightly for nearly two mouths, and in that 
time won a 
popularity and sach hearty applause as it is the lot of but 
few to receive, Gus Williams is to have his farewell benefit, his friends 
—and they are legion — will on -oubtedly see that it is a 
substantial 
one, the bill is immense and shows Williams in his hest characters. 
[Baltimore Commercial. 
Mr. Williams' specialities are of that character that never fail to set 
the audience in a 
roar, his songs are rendered in such a comical 
manner that they would caose a 
laugh to pervade the countenance of 
a 
cast iron man, [ Baltimore Telegram, Oct. 10th 1869. 
Mr. Gus Williams. a 
vocalist and " Comic " of prominence, was ac-
corded a 
hearty welcome, his style is original, his acting capital, and 
his singing very flue. 
[Baltimore Saturday Night. Oct, 9th, 1869. 
Gus Williams gave his new song of " Kully, vere's your cat ?" last 
night and created a 
great sensation with his comical manner of sing-
ing it. 
[Baltimore American. Oet. 26th, 1869. 
:f our readers wish to know where they can laugh continually, they 
shonld go to the A.41elphi, and hear the great American Cornique 
GUS Williams, lie is the best comique now on the boards. [ Sat. Ev'ng, 
Express, Boston Dec. 19th, 1869. 
Gus Williams, the American Star Coin i 
quo, the best comic singer of the 
day, thertgave a 
budget of humo-ous songs, which were rapturously 
encored and were among the best hits of the evening. [Boston Sport-
ing Times, Dee. 1st, 1869. 
Gus Williams. the great American comic singer, closed his engage-
ment here last night, Mr. Williams has held the boards at the Ameri-
can longer probably than any other travelling star thst has visited 
our city, and our theatre-goers never seem to t 
re of him as he kept a 
new budget of songs constantly before his audience, wo understand 
that he intends to return to our city in five or six weeks. 
[Pittsburg 
Leader. 1869. 
During the past month, the greatest living comic and character 
singer, Gus Williams. appeared nightly, cliciting, the most enthusiastic 
applause. [Leisure Hours, Pittsburg, June 1869. 
The " Dutch Voca'ist " Gu.s Williams, whose " Vats de brico of beans, 
Jake ?" has set all the boys to whistling on the streets, will appear in 
a 
new song. 
[Louisville paper. Feb. 1871. 
Gus William's Dutch songs fairly took the house by storm. [New York 
Star, Jan. 17th 1872. 
The other popular feature of last evening's programme-was Gut 
Williams' _Dutch Eccentricities. [New York Star, Jan. 23d, 1872.

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS, 
&a (CONCLUDED. 
In addition to the attractions already named, the favorite Dutch 
Comedian and Character Vocalist, Gus Williams, will make his re-
appearance. Mr. William's songs are all characterized with wit and 
humor, his style cf singing them very amusing, and his representa-
tions generally of a 
superior character. 
(Sunday De6patch, N. Y. Jan. 
7th, 1872. 
On the 8th Gus Williams the very excellent comic vocalist will 
appear, Williams not only pleases persons of crude tastes, but those 
who have been well satiated with amusement seeking. (N. Y. Mercury, 
Jan. 7th 1872. 
Notwithstanding the frequent allusions we have made to Me. Gus 
Williams of late, we cannot close without mentioning his renewed 
success. 
Night after night he receives encore upon encore, and is 
rarelylet off without an apololy. On Monday night he introduced still 
another new song, which seems to become quite as, it not more, popu-
lar than either of his others. 
This last he calls, " I 
Know Some Tinge," 
and is sung in such an admirable manner, as to Justify us in calling 
him the best Dutch dialect singer ever upon the Boston stage, 
(Sporting Times, Aug. 19th, 1871 
Mr. Williams, one of the most successful comic singers on the 
American stage, has extended his engagement, the announcement of 
which will be a 
source of delight to every patron of the establish-
ment ; thought apparently young, this gentleman sings in a manner 
that deservedly evokes the marked approbation of the audience, then, 
too, there is a 
pleasing feature ia each song. 
(Pittsburg Eeng 
Feb. 15th, 1869. 
Mr Williams is one of the best character singers, if not the best, that 
ever canto to our city, and be has become an immense favorite with 
our theatre goers. (Pittsburg Leader, March 21st, 1869. 
One of the chief features of the entertainment here, is the comic 
singing of Gus Williams, who is deservedly a great favolite at his 
establishment. Gus Williams is one of the best comic singers that 
ever appeared in this city, and is unequaled in his Dutch impersona-
tions, investing each character assumed by him \via a great deal of 
humorous ability, his acting being really excellent 
(Phi 
14. Mercury, 
May 16 b, 1869. 
He was greeted with loud applause last night and was strongly 
encored, and if there is any truth in the saying " laugh and grow fat" 
we should think Mr. Williams' audience would surely be weighty, for 
such shouts of merriment we seldom ever he r 
in our staid old city. 
His songs were so very enthusiastically applauded, that the applause 
had to be surpressed in order to hear the song. 
Mr. W, is one of the 
greatest comic singers of the age, he sings all his songs with spirit, 
invests them with life and beauty, and sings them with such charac-
teristic grace, that he richly merits the unbounded esteem with which 
he is held by the public genes ally. 
(Evening Mail, Pittsburg, May 19th 
1869. (1)

SDILL I 
DON'T VAS HABBY. 
As Sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I 
vas . a 
miSerable man as ever yet vas seen, 
Und since de hour ven I 
vas born, I've miserable been; 
✓eil born I 
had an ugly frown as if I'd eat a 
pill, 
Dat nasdy frown dat I 
had den, is on my feadures sdill. 
My farder he vas dead, und I 
galled my ,
ungle—pappy, 
lie beat me, kicked me, knocked me around, und, 
Sdill I 
don't vas habby. 
Yen I 
grew ub I 
dought dat I 
a 
Doctor den vould be, 
I 
changed my mind, I 
tried de Law, und den de Law tried 
me; 
I 
made a 
very slight mistake, aboud a 
person's bail, 
Dey called it " perjury," und I 
vas sent six months to coun▪ 
-
ty jail. 
Dey locked me ub, cut off my hair, vould give me no 
" 
tobacky," 
Und made me break alones all day long, und, 
Sdill I 
don't vas habby. 
I 
married, too, some time ago, a 
gal named Lena Bagon, 
I 
dought dot she vas vealthy, but soon found I 
vas mis-
tagen; 
Her moder comes to visid me, und stops dree months or so, 
Her six big sisters also come, but never seem to go. 
Dey've eat me out] of house und home, I 
begin for to look 
" 
fiappy," 
I

veek, und, 
Sdill I

BEFORE I CEASE TO LOVE. [CONCLUDED.] 
She is lovely, young and gushing, 
She's tender, true and kind, 
And her bat is like a 
soup-plate, 
And her Grecian bend's behind. 
She's arms just like a 
navvy's, 
For she once gave me a 
shove, 
And I 
fell down two flights of stairs 
Before I 
ceased to love. 
Cao.—Before I 
cease to love, 
Before I 
cease to love, 
May Sim Reeves cease to have sore throat, 
And ne'er sing under a

• Before I 
cease to love. 
If I 
thought she did'nt love me, 
"nvould cause me dreadful pain, 
I'd jump into the river, 
And I'd soon crawl out again; 
I 
would bathe myself in treacle, 
I'd swallow a 
white kid glove, 
May cheap pork-pies begin to bark 
Before I 
cease to love. 
CH0.—Before I 
cease to love, 
Before I 
cease to love, 
May Christys ne'er sing out of town, 
May they all change from black to brown, 
Before I 
cease to love.

STILL I AM NOT HAPPY.—[CommursEn.] 
When big enough to go to school, they sent me far away, 
Where all was N,N ork and drudgery, and never any play; 
No marbles, tops, no kites or hoops allowed were, but such sums 
Were set us, and small exercise for our poor teeth and gums. 
We had of meat the smallest cut, of drink the weest drappie, 
I 
almost died from hunger, but—but still I 
was not happy. 
Before I 
left, as a 
reward for never telling lies, 
The stern head-master handed me a 
volume as a 
prize; 
'Twas bound in calf, with pages gilt, ' twas heavyish to lift; 
At length, thought I, is happiness, as I 
beheld the gift; 
All tremblingly I 
opened it, alas! this eager chap he 
Read Martin Farquhar Tupper's works, and still I 
was not happy. 
ENCORE VERSES. 
Grown up I 
thought a 
doctor I'd eventually be; 
I 
changed my mind, and tried the law, and then the law tried me. 
I 
made the slightest of mistakes about a 
party's purse, 
The sentence passed npon me was ridiculously terse; 
They locked me up, cut off my hair, my " backy," and my 
rappee, 
And put me on the treadmill, where—where still I 
was not happy. 
I 
married three years back a 
wife, but found I'd been deceived, 
The property did not exist in which I 
had believed; 
Her mother pays short visits of just seven months or so, 
Her six big sisters come in turn, bu never seem to go; 
Five brothers daily dine, and tell all new that's in the tapts, 
They kindly stop to tea as well, but still I 
am not happy. 
I've speculated right and left, in bank and railway shares, 
But in each instance have they proved most ruinous affairs. 
I 
always tread on orange peel, or slides made in the gutter, 
And if my bread and butter falls, it's always on the butter. 
I 
get run over in the street, and cabmen call me " sappy," 
I 
digest nothing that I

To-morrow I

My Little One's Waiting for Me." 
You may yonder vy I 
look so distracted, 
But de reason is I've got a

Who, venever she gets a 
hold of me, 
Viii beat me in an inch of my life. 
I'm afraid for to go home dis evening, 
For I 
know right veil vere she'll be. 
Behind de door mit a 
big club stick, 
My vife she is vaiting for me. 
CHORUS. 
Oh! she looves me, I 
know, to distraction 
Und I 
really ought happy to be, 
But behind de door now, mit big club 
My Katie vas vating for me. 
Her eyes, oh how shall I 
describe dem, 
Dey're like holes dat'vas burnt in a 
rag; 
Her nose looks as if it had busted, 
Her mouth looks like a 
coffee bag, 
She says dat I 
often abuse her, 
But abused she vill never more be, 
So behind de door now mit a 
big club 
My Katie vas vaiting for me. 
Oh she looves me, I 
know, to distraction, 
Und I 
really ought happy be, 
But behind de door now mit a

My Katie vas vaiting for me.

In de oder a

She couldn't eat dat all herself. 
She gave me half, de leetle calf, 
But you know how it vas myself. 
She vas gentle, &c 
Her foot is like a

Her voice it was so sweet], 
Yen she does speak. you'd dint: dere vas 
An organ in der st reed. 
But still for dat

But you know how it vas yourself.

I KNOW SOMETHING. 
Written, Composed and sung by Gus W ILLIAMS. 
I know something which I 
don't mind telling you, 
But keep it a 
secret, now mind, 
Becourse off my wife was to find it out, too, 
I 
know that mit rage she'd go blind. 
It's about a 
young girl what I 
meet th'other day, 
While walking along in the street— 
And I 
know off this young girl know'd I 
had a 
wife 
tihe wouldn't think I 
was so sweet. 
C11011118. 
Now you know what I 
know, and what my wife don't know, 
She don't know what I 
know, and what I 
know you know, 
If you tell her what you know, and also what I 
know, 
Then she'd know what I 
know, what you know also. 
I 
know that this young girl wore lots of false hair, 
I 
could see dat at once at a 
glance, 
I 
know that her feet was much larger than mine, 
I 
found dat out when we did dance. 
She got beauty spots all over her face, 
I 
don't want to make fun at all, 
She'd a 
mole on her cheek as red as a 
beet, 
And it look'd like a 
big cod-fish ball. 
Now you know what I 
know, dm 
This girl's hair was red or a 
strawberry blonde, 
Her eyebrows hung down to her nose; 
She'd a 
mouth dat when open looked like a 
mouse- trap, 
It worked on a 
spring, I 
suppose. 
But still she's a 
beauty longside of my wife. 
To-morrow I 
get a 
Divorce— 
And the secret 
I 
dant mind telling you— 
••,_ I 
marry this young girl, of course. 
Now you know what I 
know, ec.

WHY DI:DIV 2 YOU SAY SO BEFORE. 
As so , g 
by Gus W ILLIAMS 
New by- words you 1i-flow now-a-days, are the rage, 
You'll hear them from every tongue ; 
Wherever you go you'll find that its so, 
The 
the big, old and young; 
Even the ladies are fond of the slang, 
While the boys in the street loudly roar, 
Oh, how they do shout, the latest one out, 
Why didn't you say so before ! 
One day driven mad with a 
toothache so bad, 
I 
rushed to the first doctor's shop, 
When the grinder he eyed and the tongs he applied, 
And he pulled me six times round the shop; 
Said I, when he'd done, you've pulled out the wrong one, 
While with agony loud I 
did roar; 
Now it's done, sir, says he, the fault don't lay with me; 
Why didn't you say so before! 
I 
once asked a 
friend me ten dollars to lend, 
And said : I'd return it next day. 
When he did begin at once to rub his chin, 
And these words, unto me he did say ; 
Old boy, it's too bad, I 
should have been glad, 
In fact, I'd have let you have more 
Had you called yesterday,—now, it's all paid away, 
Why didn't you say so before! 
My wife ycsterday sat crying away, 
Because our first-born was a 
boy; 
All day she would sigh and keep rubbing her eye, 
Instead of being happy •-rith joy ; 
Says she to me, ,Toe, I 
hate boys, you know, 
I'd soone of girls have a 
score; 
Says I ( with a 
leer) it's too late, now, my dear, 
Why didn't you say so before ! 
OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN, INTO THE FIRE. 
Pity my sorrow and melt at my woes, 
What I've put up with you would not suppose, 
How I've been treated and snubbed all along, 
Listen to me and I'll tell in my song; 
When but a 
schoolboy tho' trying my best, 
In the last form I 
continued to nest, 
Getting well flogged when I 
tried to rise higher, 
Twas out of the frying pan into the fire. 
CHORUS. 
Out of the frying pan, out of the frying pan, 
Perhaps you may fall, if too high you aspire. 
Out of the frying-pan, out of the frying-pan, 
Out of the frying-pan, into the fire. 
When tired of leading a 
bachelor's life, 
Looking around me I 
sought for a 
wife, 
Met with an angel with manners so soft, 
Face like a 
cherub's that sits up aloft. 
Oh ! how 1 
picture our lives free from care, 
Happy as Dicky-birds up in the air, 
But such a 
temper had darling Maria 
Twas out of the frying-p3n into the fire. 
Out of the fryingpan, 
Doating on children, to badies endeared, 
Happy was I 
when first twins appear'd 
But the next year they were triplets we had, 
Somehow or other I 
wasn't so glad; 
Now at my table twelve mouths do I 
see. 
Hungry and open and waiting for me, 
Why did I 
ever to marriage aspire 
Twas out of the frying-pan into the fire. 
Once I 
bought shares in a 
line that they made, 
Twenty per cent was the dividend paid, 
Crash went the bubble, my savings entire, 
Went out of the frying-pan into the fire. 
Out of the frying-pan, dm

DOWN AMONG THE COALS. 
My Jemima was in service once 
At a 
house in Madison Square, 
She never got out and so I 
used 
To go and court her there. 
Her mistresses were two old maids, 
Such very particular souls, 
That Jemima had to often hide me 
In amongst the coals. 
CHORUS.----Down among the coals, down among the coals, 
Oh, by Jove it was a 
lark, all alone and in the dark, 
Down among thu'coals, down among the coals, 
Waiting to make love to my Jemitna. 
When in that cellae, cobwebs used 
To decorate my clothes, 
The coal-dust got into my eyes, 
And would get up my nose; 
And when it rain d the water came 
A trickling through a 
crack, 
And I 
always fancied spiders were 
A crawling down my back. 
Down among the coals, dm. 
One night they sent Jemima out, 
Who'd forgotten her dear Joe 
'Was down among the Wallsends 
And a 
prisoner below. 
I 
began to fr, ezc., was obliged ,t,) 
sneeze 
And felt inclined to shout, 
At last call'd thro' the keyhole, 
"Here Jeminia let's get out." 
Down among the coals, & c. 
At last the door was opened, 
'T was dark, oh blest of bliss, 
I 
threw my arms around her neck, 
And gave her such a 
kiss. 
A 
scream and then a 
shovel, 
Gave me one upon the head, 
I'd kissed her ancie it mistress, 
Oh ! ha, I 
needn't say I 
tied. 
Down among the coals, & c. 
They say 
Love lau7hs at loAsmiths, 
That was the case with us. 
Of course Jemima had to leave, 
It caused an awful fuss ; 
But I 
married her soon after that, 
I'm as happy as a 
king. 
And often round our cozy fire 
This is what we sint,.

Oh Brigham, Brigham Young, It's a 
miracle how he survives; With his 
  
e 
9 40  
4 ._ _ar 
 
roaming rains and his pretty little lambs, And his five-and-forty wivcs. 
His number forty-five is about sixteen, 
Number one is sixty-and-thme; 
And they make such a 
riot, 
How he ever keeps them quiet, 
Is a 
down-right mystery to me. 
For they clatter and they claw, and jaw, jaw, jaw, 
And each has a 
different desire, 
It would aid the renown 
Of the best shop in town, 
To supply them with half they require.— Cho.

BRIGHAM YOUNG.—[CoNcLunEn.) 
Old Brigham Young was a 
stout man once, 
Though now he is thin and old; 
And I 
grieve to state 
He is bald on his pate, 
Which once had a 
covering of gold. 
For his youngest wives don't like white wool, 
And his old ones won't have red; 
So with tearing it out, 
Taking turn and turn about, 
They have torn all the hair from his head.—CUOZUS. 
Now his girls sing psalms all day, 
And his boys they all sing songs; 
And among such a 
crowd 
He has it pretty loud, 
For they are as musical as Chinese gongs. 
But when they advance, for a 
Mormon dance, 
He is filled with the greatest surprise, 
For they're sure to end the night 
With a 
Tabernacle fight, 
And scratch out one another's eyes.— CHORUS. 
There never was a 
home like Brigham Young's, 
So curious and so queer; 
If his joys are double, 
He's a 
treble lots of trouble, 
And it gains on him year by year. 
Yet he sits in state, and bears his fate, 
In a 
serve-me-very-right sort of way; 
If there's one wife to bury,— 
There's another one to marry, 
And there's something goes wrong everyday.—Co. 
Now if anybody envies Brigham Young, 
Let them go to the Great Salt Lake, 
And if they have leisure 
To examine their pleasure, 
They will find it's a 
great mistake. 
One wife at a 
time, so says my rhyme, 
Is enough for the proudest Don; • 
So ere you strive 
To be lord of forty-five, 
Live happy,—if you eau„—with one.—Citows.

BILLY JOHNSON'S BALL.—[CoNcLuDED.] 
There were the Jones-es-es, and the Brown-es-es, 
And the Smith-es-es a 
score, 
The Spriggins-es, the Scoggins-es, 
And half a 
dozen more; 
In Billy's room, there wasn't room, 
To dance a 
decent jig, 
So he went and took a 
big one 
At " The Tinder-box and Pig." 
Spoken.—An efficient band was provided, consisting of a 
fiddle, 
a 
tin whistle, and a 
Jew's harp and they played—CHo. 
They introduced the baby, 
And we kissed it twice all round, 
Mrs. Johnson was quite "overcome," 
Fell fainting to the ground. 
But they " brought her to" with water, 
And " a 
drop of something in," 
And when " she felt herself again," 
The dancing did begin. 
Cno. 
In and out and round about, 
Such a 
ball was never seen, 
And every DOW and then, 
We'd " a 
drop to drink between," 
Billy Johnson he got dancing 
With all the girls he'd find, 
Mrs. Johnson she grew jealous, 
And declared he was " unkind." 
Spoken.—I 
make it a 
rule never to interfere in family quarrels' 
so I 
chose a 
lovely creature in red and yellow, and we glided into 
the—Cao. 
I 
drank " love" to the Jones-es, 
I 
drank " love" to the Browns, 
I 
tried to keep on dancing, but 
'Twas somehow " ups and downs," 
To tell you how it ended, 
I 
really am not able, 
For I 
found myself next morning 
Lying underneath the table. 
Spoken.—I 
felt rather confused till a 
friend reminded me that 
I 
Lad been doing the—Ono.

VERE'S MY LOUISA. 
Written and Sung by Gus Wm-um. 
I 
hope you'll excuse me vat I'm going to say, 
But Louisa, mine vile, has vent und run'd avay, 
I've been hunting for her too de whole of de day, 
Oh I 
vere has dat beauty now gone. 
She vent oud day behind yesterday for to buy, 
Some coffee und dings, und a 
nice onion pie; 
Und if she don't nine pack, I'm sure I

Oh I 
yore do you dink she has gone. 
CLIORUS. 
Oh 
vere's my Louisa, mine own darling frow, 
Who had a 
high forehead, ('dwas just like a 
cow); 
Her nose it vas crooked, she had vone eyebrow, 
De cat chewed de odor vone off, dat's so. 
I 
met my Louisa ' bout two years ago, 
'Dwas oud at a 
picnic, vay down at Cairo, 
Vern a 
fellar vile dancing stebbed on her big toe, 
Yen she squealed und fell down on de floor. 
I

helped her upon to a 
seat, 
Und I

Und, " Jimminey Christmas," how I 
did him beat; 
I

Oh I 
vere's my Louisa, cte. 
Yen I 
licked dat fellar, she promised to be 
Mine wife, und she sait dat she vould stick to me, 
But now, she's jumped oud of my sight like a 
flea, 
Und I 
really don't know vat to do. 
I'll write in de babers aboud her of course, 
Tolding her for sure to gome pack to her boss; 
If she don't gome in dree days, I'll got a 
divorce, 
Vich means, dat we'll be cut in dwo. 
Oh I

REMEMBRANCE OF HOME: OR HOME ONCE 
MORE. 
Written and Sung by Gus W ILLIAM'. 
I 
am thinking of my home, 
Of the cottage on the hill; 
The cottage where my poor old mother died: 
Of the orchard, of the school where I 
learned the golden 
rule; 
Of old " Dobbin" on whose back I 
oft did ride: 
And as I 
recall the scene, 
It seems just like a 
dream; 
A dream that is past now, and is o'er: 
A tear comes in my eye, and I 
can only sigh, 
For to see my dear and good old home once more. 
CHORUS. 
Home once more, Home once more, 
Shall I 
ever see my home once more ? 
Home once more, home once more, 
Shall I 
ever see my home once more ? 
Shall I 
ever see the church where I 
often used to go? 
Shall I 
ever see that dear old church again ? 
Shall I 
ever see the mill that stood upon the hill, 
Or must I 
in a 
foreign land remain? 
Shall I 
ever see my father? 
That dear old grey haired man, 
As he sat in the arm-chair by the door 
I 
have power, I 
have wealth, 
Yet I'd give them all for health, 
So that I 
could see my dear old home once more. 
tome once more, to.

THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE 
—{GoxturDED.] 
Do not fancy you'll meet with a 
cabby, 
Who more than his fare will not take, 
May as well think an oyster could crawl up a 
tree, 
And there you would make a 
mistake. 
If you fancy a 
g:r1 dislikes a 
small kiss, 
You must be—what some folks call—a 
cake: 
If you think your collector of taxes won't call, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
Don't imagine a 
man has no coin in his purse, 
Because he's not dress'd as a " swell," 
A book with a 
cover that's olden and worn 
Has often a 
good tale to tell. 
You'll oft see a 
swell, all collar, and cuffs 
To his finger-tips, white as snow-flake, 
But if you believe he's all over alike, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
The ladies still wear an abundance of hair, 
'Tis a 
wonder their dear necks don't break,, 
But if you imagine they grow it themselves, 
That's where you make the mistake. 
When courting, don't write spooney letters 
To your fair one; for love, nor for sport, 
For should you but break any promise, 
They are sure to be read out in court. 
-When you wed, do not marry the fam'ly as well, 
For that will not a 
paradise make; 
Above all, close the door to your mother-in-law, 
Or—that's where you'll make the mistake. 
But—talking of marriage—reminds me, 
We've given the Germans a 
shake: 
They fancied Louise and her cash was for them, 
That's where they made the mistake. 
Don't imagine your milk is not " doctored," 
Nor quite pure is your two-shilling tea, 
Don't imagine it's awfully jolly, 
The first lime you go on the sea. 
Don't reckon your chicks before hatched, or 
Your duck may p'rhaps turn out a 
drake, 
Don't go and cat mustard, and fancy it's jam, 
Or that's where you'll make the mistake. 
With all the advice I 
have given, 
You ought to be well wide-awake, 
And should you imagine I'll sing any moral 
That's where you make the mistake.

TEN THOUSAND MILES AWAY. 
Sing oh for a 
brave and gallant bark, 
And a 
brisk and lively breeze; 
A 
little crew and a 
captain too, 
To carry sue over the seas; 
To carry use over the seas, my boys, 
To my true love so gay, 
She has taken a 
trip on a 
government ship, 
Ten thousand miles away. 
Cuottus.—So blow the winds I 
oh, a 
roving I 
will go, 
1'11 stay no snore on Manhattan shore, 
So ict the music play ; 
fr:‘ 
tart by the morning train, to cross the raging main, 
For 1.'m on the move to my own true love, 
T.nsa thousand miles away. 
My true love she is beautiful, 
My true love she is young; 
Her eyes are blue as the violet's hue 
And silvery sounds her tongue; 
And silvery sounds her tongue-, my boys, 
But while I

I'm not of a 
quarrelsome nature at all, 
But a 
peaceable sort of a 
man, 
, 
And I 
always avoid a 
dispute or a 
brawl, 
That's to siy if I 
possibly can. 
Still if people behave in an insolent way, 
Or to argue or fight are inclin'tl, 
Why I 
first listen calmly to all they've to say, 
Then I 
give them a 
bit of my mind. 
CII0ItUS. 
A hit of my mind, a 
bit of my mind, 
If friend , or relations should e'er prove unkind, 
You cannot conceive the relief that I 
find, 
if I'm able to give them a 
bit of my mind. 
When a 
wild little urchin, of seven years old, 
I 
was under a 
pedagogue's I 
tile, 
And the titAt time I 
got into trouble, I'm told, 
Was for smashing a 
window at school ; 
I 
was promised the cane, as a 
matter of course, 
Which I 
told them was not very kind, 
But I 
didn't much care the' they flogged me by force, 
For I 
gave them a 
bit of my mind. 
A bit of my mind, &o. 
Fre been sadly deceived by my intimate friend, 
Though I 
treated him just ii hn a 
prince. 
For be took all the cash I 
could manage to lend, 
And I've never set eyes on hint sluice 
Still t 
wrote him a 
letter, indignant and strong, 
Full of all the bad names I 
could find. 
And it pleas'll me to ! lank, tho' his conduct was wrong, 
That I 
gave him a 
bit of my mind. 
A bit of may mind, eco. 
So if ever I'm injured, or treated amiss, 
My behavior is always the same, 
And I've o e 
sat isfr.ciou at least, which is this, 
That I 
don't think I'm greatly to blame. 
If my wife should elope w Ilia rival to-day, 
(Tho-prb I 
might not at first be resian'd), 
I 
should feel myself better, " I'm happy to say,” 
If I 
gave them a 
bit of nay mind. 
A bit of my mind, &o.

SILvElt PLATED MEN. 
Written by BOBBY NEWCOILB, and sung by Gus. W ILLIAMS.

way, New York. Price 35 Cents. 
In life we find some funny folks, 
Whose ways are very strange, 
But as you journey through the world, 
Of course we like a 
change ; 
People of true metal are 
A scarcity, but then 
We know their value when we deal, 
With Silver plated men. 
CHORUS. 
Then always be straight-forward, boys, 
Let your motto read, 
Remember when you want a 
friend, 
A friend's a 
friend indeed ; 
Act on the square to every one, 
They'll all speak of you then, 
As not belonging to the class, 
Called Silver plated men. 
(adelt1) 
When driven by adversity. 
And fortune leaves your side, 
'Tis then you need a 
helping hand, 
The troubled sea to ride ; 
You soon find out the sunshine friends, 
For what's your cares to them, 
They promise much and nothing do ; 
They're Silver plated men. 
Then always be, (U. 
A man's like gold or silver, and 
The way to try him best, 
Is judge not by appearances, 
But put him tb the test; 
You'll soon find out what he is worth, 
You'll know him surely then, 
If he's true metal, he is worth, 
A hundred plated men 
Then always be, cto.

FANCY. I 
CAN SEE HER NOW.—[CONCLUDED 
Fie had one fight since I've been here, 
I 
knocked a 
fellow flat; 
Because he roared right in my ear,— 
" 
I 
say, I'll have your hat ;" 
This hat my Betsy gave to me, 
And said, in voice so sweet, 
You wear this for my sake, dear Joe," 
As she placed it on my feet. 
Spoken—My head I 
mean.—I'm thinkin' so much o' her, I 
don't 
• 
know what I 
say.—Cnonus. 
The lovely bread she used to bake, 
The scones and pancakes too; 
And Everton Toffy she could make 
As sticky and thick as glue. 
I'd back her, too, agin the world, 
Liver and bacon to fry, 
When think o' the watery '
taters too, 
The steam comes from my eye. 
Spoken— I 
mean, when I 
think o' the steaming 'taters the water 
comes frae my eye, darned if I 
know what I'm sayin', thinkiu' o' 
that lass.---Cuonus. 
I 
bought her, once, a 
splendid dress, 
That cost me many a 
groat; 
To show ye how she loved me, now, 
I'll tell a 
nannygoat :—(anecdote.) 
She saved a 
great lump of her dress, 
This is a 
truth, I 
vow, 
And made me this fine waistcoatl 
That ye see me wearin' now. 
Spoken— Look at that!—there's a St—the Prince o' Wales' 
tailor couldn't mak' better nor that--no fear o' it splittin'— plenty 
o' room to grow,— ah! she wor a 
good lass, she'd do onythiug I'd 
tell her without me kickin' her. 
She wor dairy-maid wi' Farmer 
Fen, I 
used to work at plough,--then we used to romp when work 
war done— I 
used to pinch her arm as hard as I 
could till she 
cried, and she used to hit I 
on the head NVP the spade,—what 
fun we had.—Cnonus. 
It's no use me a-standin' here, 
I'm wastin' all my time; 
But to meet my Bet again, 
The highest mountains I 
would climb; 
If I 
can't see nowt on her here, 
Frac Lnunon I'll retire, 
And weepin' for my Betsy Gray, 
Go back tae Lancashire.—Cnosua.
