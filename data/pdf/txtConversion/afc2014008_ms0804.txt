 Honest Abe's Birthday
 
Have delayed sending the original sheet on "Peace through Museums" t
Ill
 
t

Have a wonderful letter from Ted, whom you have seen by now, and shall be
 
interested in his as well as your professional as well as personal reaction
 
to the enclosed --- as soon as I have time to reply to him as well.
 
I indited the Peace bit on a hunch that it was an idea worth considering,
 
and the more I think about i

INTRODUCTION TO
 GOD'S CITY by JOSEPH BRANDON FORD
 
(
THIS INTRO IS WRITTEN ABOUT A MONTH AFTER THE "PEACE THROUGH MUSEUA's)
 
AFTER EARLY REACTIONS THAT "YOU SHOULD PUBLISH IT ANONYMOUSLY,  
TO AVOID
  
TERRORISTS FROM ANY OF THE RELIGIOUS CAMPS"..
. "  FANATICS MIGHT  DEEM IT  
EVEN MORE SACRILEGIOUS THAN SALMON RUSHIE'S SATANIC SATIRES  
BEWARE OF
  
AYOTOLLAHS AND CHIEF RABBIS. TO SAY NOTHING OF THE CHRISTIAN-RIGHTISTS ")  
The featuring of "God's City"  on the most celebrated cover in American
 
journaljjsm (
TIME MAGAZINE,  JAN.
 1996) stands in welcome contrast to the
 
choice of the weirdest politico in the current limelight  (NEWT( as the "MAN
 
OF THE YEAR"
 for 1995.
 Time,  both literally and in the popular rag,-form,
 
can take us back to fundamentals -- -far away from the fads and foibles of
 
what Sorokin dubbed "government of the politicians,  by the politicians and
 
for the politicians," with Newt as THE MAN.
 Elsewhere I have already
 
suggested this motto be revised to add at the end:  "And for the lobbyists"
 
In any case,
 we may need a new "peace lobby" to foster and support the
 
idea of contributing to peace through making a museum of this City of
 
God(s) -
-
 at least the Old City with the holy places of so many religions
 
and sects.
 The new Israeli city could  be left to its own devices in a
 
region, and we hope eventually a world, at peace.  
And if we could achieve peace in God's own City,
 people in other places
 
might take heed and establish such museums in imitation of God's.
 Nortki rn
 
Ireland? There would be debate as to where to start,  but joint operations
 
in Belfast and Derry would be welcome!
 The list of other sites could be
 
endless.  There are  holy places all over this benighted globe.
 Fighting
 
goes in mamy if not most of them,  and as in Belfast and Derry people seen
 
to like the respite of even a Cease Fire.
 Heritage of "Evil Empires"
 
endures in many places other than the onetime Soviet Union.
 
Sociologists and anthropologists agree that there has been some form of
 
religion in all communities above the level of clan, and probably below
 
that level as well.
 Kroeber,  as Distinguished Visiting Professor at
 
Columbia after his retirement from U
.C.Berkeley, asked a now well-known
 
anthropologist only one major question during  what was for the youth a
 
long and grelinhg doctoral orals : "Do you, sir,  know of any tribe or
 
community without a religion?" The young candidate started to dilate on
 
possible exceptions, and then in the middle of a sentence suddenly came to
 
his senses and stopped, as he reports it,  with the exclamation:  "Professor
 
Kroeber,  I don't think there has ever been such a community or tribe."
 
Kroeber smiled and commented:  "I' m very happy that you corrected yourself
 
in time.
 I agree complet e ly.
 For  a moment
 I was  worried
 you  might f
ind
 
one
 
Yet this essential institution,  when its organized forms  reach a certain
 
critical level, seems to set tribe against tribe,  people against people,
 
even civilization against civilization.
 For the latter,  witness the spread
 
of  Islam for one,  and the Crusades as a "counter-revolution.
 
Jerusalem still stands,  with holy places of both Islam and Christianity---
and under the present suzerainty of a third "civilization" -
-
 the "fossil"
 
as labelled by Toynbee and before him (
though few other than I have taken
 
note)
Freud.  As Churchill said about Britain being a chicken whose neck
 
note
 Freud.  As Churchill said about Britain being a chicken whose neck
 
was to be wrung by Hitler:  "Some fossil!"
 Since the dawn of history.
 
sccholars have found religion to be at least the alleged source of much
 
conflict a
ind war among peoples.
 
Three of the so-called "world religions" with their many "
jarring sects"
 
conflict most notably today in their claims on God's City--Jerusalem.
 
Fanatics and probably a plurality of their fellow religionists assert
 
exclusive rights to the possession and sovereignty of at least important
 
parts of God's City.
 Is it not possible that  the vision,  though
 
Mitchener presented it as result of an anesthertic, could be "prophetic"? --
-
 at least in the sense this is attributed to the prophets of the Hebrews.
 
Even the Moslems recognize Hebrews  along with Christians as "People of the
 
Book,  and clsim the prophetsin their own ilineage.
 Nax  Weber  pointed out
 
the prohetic tradition of the Hebrews as the first anti-establishmentarian
 
tradition where other religious leaders had tended to support the rulers..
 
I
t would ill befit the heirs of the Prophets in modern Israel to stand in
 
the way of a new vision in that ancient traditon
 The Israeli
 
archaeologist rejected the vision outright as the essence of evil,
 
something that must be prevented at all costs.
 Could their be wiser heads
 
among the modern heirs of that illustrious tradition of thje Hebrew
 
Prophets?
 
Perhaps the creation of a museum -
-
 or more than one museum both in
 
Jerusalem and other disputed "holy spots" -
-
 could be an idea whose t
ime
 
has come, or might come perhaps in the burgeoning twenty-first centiury.
 
At least it should be worthy of consideration as an alternative to further
 
religious crusades -
-
-
 and endless wqrs over how bestto honor God..
 
The vision of the visiting Irish-American archaeologist  should not be so
 
rudely and totally dismissed as a threat and a danger, as the prospective
 
Israeli cabinet-member  did in Mitchener's fiction.
 As a fellow heir of
 
both the Irish and Judeo-Christian straditions,  I look forward to its
 
implementation in fact, as an alternative to the present conflicts..
 
But how to get the ball rolling?  And how to find and fund a Peace Lobby?
 
Ideas would be far more welcome to me than the threats of  terrorist's
 
bomb, as my first reactions warn me to foresee.
 I doubt if either I or the
 
idea would be promoted to the rank of Rushdie,  but others warn of its
 
possiblitly.
 At my ancient age and perhaps as a result of the onset of
 
semi-senility I have nofear of either Ayatollahs or their counterparts in
 
other religions and do not have much to lose so far as remaining time on
 
this mundane level goes.
 The only reward I woulld ask for my idea and
 
peril would be a lifetime pass to the new museum  -
-
 with perphaps
 
endorsements for any other institutions  that might eventuate on the model
 
of yjr City pg God,
 
But tempus fugit, and I as well.
 Dplease come up with some creative ideas
 
ere this century and in all probablility I as well pass into the oblivion
 
of eternity..
. Only God knows, as Jesus foretold, the day and the hour of
 
the latter.  We are pretty sure of the imminemce of the fin d

Dear Jane:
 
I regret  it has taken me so long to thank you for your
 
pleasant  luncheon.  I left town that evening to help my niece,
 
Anna Chairetakis,  relocate my brother Alan Lomax to a
 
hospital  in Florida.  He is  improving,  but he  is  81 years old
 
and he is aphasic.  It  is hard.
 
He  spent most of his  life testifying from long personal
 
experience to the depth,  the energy,  and the creative
 
vitality of the traditional arts of the varied peoples,  not
 
only of the United States,  but of the world.  I see in your
 
various  speeches that  you too recognize these qualities,  and
 
I appreciate that.
 
But  I am getting old myself now,  and I find I am becoming
 
inexpressibly weary of forever pretending a lot of things:
 
that wrongful acts can be compensated for by
 
figuring out and exploiting the  inevitable cracks  in the "new
 
system",
 
that there is always hope if we can only hunker
 
down and survive the upcoming bad spells;
 
that equal treatment  is the same thing as  fair
 
treatment.
 
It all  just  isn't  so,  and it never has been.
 
Maybe.  at the age of 75.  I' m finally disappointed,  like a
 
young girl.  All my working life  I' ve tried to be  flexible,
 
ingenieous,  and positive;  I' ve tried to put a good face on
 
things.  But  I know now that  I will never recover from the
 
deliberate destruction that you,  representing a friendly
 
administration,  have visited upon the Folk and Traditional
 
Arts Program.  The Republicans never did us  so bad.
 
And you didn't have to do it,  Jane.  You had other choices.
 
You wiped out a little thing that was good,  for what you
 
considered a more important good;  but you were wrong,  and I
 
have to tell you this,  because nobody else will.
 
As a senior woman who cares very deeply about the  state of
 
the arts  in our country,  I tell you that you did a wrong
 
thing here.  You could have,  and you should have,  made
 
exceptions  for the folk and the traditional arts;  and you
 
should have and could have consulted yourself personally,
 
directly,  with their leaders.  This  is an area where
 
exceptions always must be made;  there is no exception to
 
this.
 
I don't particularly feel bad friends with you,  and I hope
 
you won't with me either.  I also assume that,  because of our
 
mutually shared interests  in the arts,  we will meet again.  I
 
hope you will believe that,  in spite of my uncommon plain
 
speaking,  I feel for the complexity of your task and the
 
depth of energy and thought you have brought to it.  I
 
reiterate my offer to be of help in any way you elect.  But  I
 
will always  speak plain.
 
Yours  sincerely,

Dear Jane:
 
I regret  it has taken me so long to thank you for your
 
pleasant  luncheon.  I left town that evening to help relocate
 
my brother,  Alan,  to a Florida hospital.  Three days  later I
 
flew to Belfast NI  in a delegation of folklorists  invited by
 
the British Council for a ten day study tour.
 
I' m only  just back,  bringing Dan Sheehy a number of relevant
 
publications given by our hospitable hosts,  none more
 
important,  it seems to me,  than their planning document:  To
  
the Millenium:  a Strategy for the Arts  in Northern Ireland.  
It  is a remarkably humane and cogent statement,  sensibly
 
addressing issues that extend across the Atlantic,  including
 
the  state of their traditional arts.
 
And,  Jane,  their plan  for their arts  flatly proposes doubling 
their current revenues by the year 2001,  banking on public
 
and private resources.  The thing is,  they believe that art  is
 
not  just  important but vital,  that  it can help see them
 
through the "troubles",
 that  it  can make a platform upon
 
which every citizen can declaim,  paint,  dance,  display.  In
 
particular they feel that the arts traditional to old Ireland
 
and its newer citizens can come to be  seen as common
 
possessions  in which everyone from any background,
 
denomination,  or political persuasion can take pride.
 
I was  so moved by their confidence and their energy.  And I
 
was  so embarrassed and angry at the feeble,  defensive
 
policies of my own infinitely richer,  infinitely more
 
"sophisticated"  country where the Arts Endowment  is villified
 
and starved,  and its  struggling Folk Arts Program is almost
 
inadvertently
 deprived of  its ability to continue its
 
mission.
 
The problem that Folk Arts now faces,  you see,  is that  in the
 
reshaping of the agency,  it has been subjected to uniform
 
agency policies which effectively eliminate every one of the
 
strategies we so laboriously had created for assuring the
 
broad geographic sweep,  the unprecedented cultural access and
 
the overall high quality that have made the Folk Arts Program
 
shine.  Under the present  system there  is no way to plan,
 
there  is no way to summons and inspire the outside public and
 
private collaborations we always promoted and that  so
 
enhanced our few dollars.  When I look at the  field,  it  is
 
floundering.
 
Equal treatment  is not equivalent to fair treatment,  as you
 
know.  Affirmative action programs came about because many
 
people began to realize this.  The Folk Arts Program deserves
 
fair treatment,  and that  is a different treatment than that
 
afforded the Music Program or the Literature Program,  just as
 
theirs  is different  from each other.
 
Well,  to get back to my initial paragraph,  I hope you look at
 
the North Ireland planning document.  It doesn't address
 
Amewrican problems,  naturally,  but it  is a breath of fresh
 
air,  enthusiasm,  and creative thinking,  which I think you
 
would relish.  And I hope you will also believe that,  as a
 
senior woman who has been at this business  since the days of
 
the WPA,  I feel  for the complexity of your responsibility and
 
the depth of energy and commitment you have brought to it.  I
 
reiterate my offer to be of help in any way you elect,  but  I
 
will always  speak my mind.  How about  inviting me or some
 
other folk arts  folks to come up with a better plan than the
 
one that  is making us  all  so unhappy? What have you got to
 
lose?
 
Yours ever,

Dear Sir:
 
3800 North Fairfax Dr.  #410
 
Arlington,  Va.  22203
 
February 14,  1996
 
I write to express my very real dismay at the February 1996
 
issue of the SMITHSONIAN.
 
The cover is  sexist and subtly condescending,  the  internal
 
photographs  (94-99)  no better.  The article by Maggie Steber
 
is  reasonable,  but uninformed of the essential fact that the
 
National Square Dancing Convention has dedicated itself to a
 
cause that has engendered nation-wide concern:  to make the
 
square dance  "the national dance of the United States".
 
I myself,  along with folklorists  from the Smithsonian and the
 
Librarian of Congress.  have,  in several previous years,
 
testified before Congress  in opposition to this bill.  Our
 
view was and is that no single dance form can at present
 
represent our complex national unity and that the selection
 
of national symbols is a complex task that must take into
 
consideration the many as well as the few dance forms
 
(consider:  polka,  tap,  round dance,  hip hop,  mambo,  hula,
 
buck dance etc.  etc.) that  identify varied American
 
populations.  We are also concerned that the NSDC has known
 
monetary connections with the various western costumers,
 
recordists,  shoe companies,  dance halls et al that benefit
 
heavily from their sponsorship.
 
The NSDC has recently resorted to a campaign to force this
 
misguided bill through state by state,  and they are doing
 
pretty well,  I am sorry to say.  I personally have  spoken
 
before national meetings of the American Folklore Society and
 
the Society of Ethnomusicology urging members to oppose it.
 
It  seems extraordinary to me that  I must again raise this
 
issue before the editorial Board of the Smithsonian Magazine.
 
Don't you  folks ever consult your own experts within your own
 
institution?
 Any folklorist at the Center for Folklore
 
Programs and Culture Studies could have filled you in.
 
Frankly,  had you shown me this entire  issue,  I not only would
 
have pointed out the difficulties of the cover and the cover
 
article but the equally irritating portrayals of southern
 
life in your story on the  Irwin Museum,  (which is  simply one
 
more of the myriad "old-timey days" collections that dot our
 
landscape) .
 You have actually outdistanced most other
 
magazines by simultaneously featuring the two major
 
caricatures of southern womanhood -
-
 the impoverished,  out-
dated,  helpless,  uneducated old moutain woman  (p.  47)
 and
 
the cutie-pie,  middle class,  out-dated,  uneducated baby doll
 
(cover,  p.  93-99) .
 Good grief.
 
In the same mailing,  I received several requests  for
 
membership renewal.  You know,  people believe  in things that
 
reach them that  say "Smithsonian",  and you therefore have a
 
responsibility to publish a magazine with a lot more in mind
 
than  just  competing with the other covers on the drugstore
 
display racks.  You ought to make  sure your articles -
-
 most
 
especially the pictures -
-
 are edited by someone who knows
 
something about the subject.  I' m going to hold off
 
resubscribing for a while.
 
Very truly yours,

Dear Guy,
 
I think it  is delightful that you are reaching the time of
 
your life when people are  starting to celebrate you.  Having
 
been celebrated myself a good bit over the past few years,  my
 
advice is not to allow one speck of modesty to enter your
 
mind at any time during any of these pleasant events.  Just
 
lean back and enjoy every compliment to the utmost.
 
Because,  after all,  you deserve them.  You' ve been deeply
 
involved in social movements that are now part of our
 
nation's proudest history and you did a superb job of
 
documenting what you learned and saw and heard.  You' ve made
 
some excellent books on important  subjects and you' ve created
 
a whole new kind of documentary recording.  On top of that,
 
you' ve kept on making your own lovely music and trying to
 
help other people keep their music going.  I know you look
 
back every once  in a while -
-
 at  least  I do -
-
 and think oh
 
gosh,  that didn't really go all that well and there was a
 
terrible  fly in that particular soup and nobody really knows
 
how awful that other thing was,  but you have to look at what
 
you' ve done on balance.  And on balance,  you have come out
 
looking like an honest hard-working,  care-taking,  loving man
 
who has done a fine  job with the chances  life gave him.  And I
 
don't know fairer words to send you.
 
It did seem to me though that  I could also send a couple of
 
snapshots of brother Alan and me having our own good times,
 
just  for inspiration perhaps.  I couldn't  find the right kind
 
of shot of the two of us together,  but here's one  I like of
 
Alan at Bessie's  last Georgia Sea Island Festival,  sitting
 
with a young friend and enjoying the music.  My picture was
 
taken on the White House lawn with Cab Calloway and Ray
 
Charles when I got my Medal of Arts.  What great company to be
 
in!  Ray Charles and I walked on to the platform together and
 
we held hands through most of the ceremony;  he likes to hold
 
hands and so do  I.
 
And I wish I could hold yours at whatever bash they' re having
 
for you in Highlander,  but  I'll be down  just then in Florida
 
with Alan.  And so we will both be sending you our love and
 
admiration,  by ESP or thought waves or something else handy.
 
Till we see each other again,  then,  much love
 to you and
 
your great  family,  especially my old friend Candie..
 
Affectionately always,
 
HIGHLANDER

Dear Bess,
 
It's hard for us to believe too,  but Guy Carawan
 
has picked his banjo,  hammered his dulcimer and
 
led us in songs of struggle at Highlander for four
 
decades.  We have reason to celebrate!
 Will you
 
help us?
 
In May we plan to honor Guy's work at Highlander
 
and one of the things we want to do is to make a
 
memory book.
 Would you write a poem,  a letter,  a
 
song or send a picture that we can put in a book
 
to give to him?
 On May 4 we want people who can,
 
to join us in the evening when we will present Guy
 
with the book.
 
If you can be with us  (we hope you can)  or if you
 
can't,  please don't hesitate to call or write with
 
any creative ideas about this occasion.
 We want
 
to be sure it's a special night for Guy.
 
We look forward to hearing from you.
 
Yours,
 
Sessions and Mary T om M ams

NANCY SWEEZY
 
Nancy Sweezy,  Co-Founder and Executive Director of Count
.:"
 
Roads,  Inc.,  is both a scholar of  traditional  crafts and one
 
of  the most  imaginative and dedicated of American public
 
folklorists.
 Through a series of unusual  efforts she h s
 
done much to improve the lives of  t
.
re
tHonel  craftsperson.°
'
 
and to nurture their art.
 
Trained at the Museum School  of  the Museum of Fine Arts,
 
Boston,  from 1937  to 1941,  Nancy Sweezy was an active potter
 
for twenty-five years.
 Her enthusiasm for traditional  arts
 
and her knowledge of  the economic realities affecting crafts
 
led her over the past twenty-eight years to undertake five
 
important programs on behalf of these arts:
 
(1)  She  (with Ralph Rinzler and Norman Kenned')
 
established the Country Roads shop in Cambridge,  Mass.,  to
 
introduce Southern crafts to New England.
 This shop not
 
only provided income to the artists but attempted to foster
 
an understanding of their culture by displaying photographs
 
of  them,  their production techniques,  their materials and
 
tools,  etc.,  along with their works.
 After closing the
 
doors of  the shop,  Nancy continued Country Roads as an
 
organization working on behalf of traditional  arts and
 
artists.
 
(2)  She purchased and operated Jugtown Pottery in North
 
Carolina from 1968 to 1982.
 Since its  founding this pottery
 
had combined the craft skills of  local  potters with the
 
business knowledge and contacts of  its  founders,  Jacques and
 
Juliana Buzby.
 In the 1960s the incapacitation of Mrs.
 
Buzby threatened to end the operation.
 Nancy Sweezy saved
 
the pottery and trained its  local  potter,  Vernon Owen,  to
 
assume ownership and manage the business operations.
 Owen
 
not only went on to become an award-winning craftsman but
 
helped to build the enormous community of potters now
 
flourishing in the region.
 Without Sieezv's initiative,
 
this would not have happened.
 
(3)  She undertook scholarly study of  Southern pottery.
 
From 1982 to 1984 Nancy Sweezy was under contract  to the
 
Smithsonian Institution to study Southern traditional
 
pottery.
 She documented virtually all  the old potteries  in
 
the region,  interviewing and photographing the pot t e rs,
 
their work,  and their workshops.
 The study resulted in a
 
celebrated exhibition at the Smithscn an in 1984
 
(subsequently taken to other parts of  the country)  and also
 
in  Sweezy's book Raised  in CJ
.
 It  is one of the three
 
most  respected studies of Southern traditional  pottery.
 
(4)  She founded the Refugee Arts
 rou .
 From 1985  t:
 
l 92 she led a broad-based coalition of  Southeast Asians
 nd
 
Americans that helped the immigrants prer-'::ve the.
 '
i
zl
 
heritages  through apprenticeship programs,  :uhlic
 
performances,  and other activities.
 
(5)  In 1992 she formed the Armeni n Cultural  proJect
.,
 
which  is organiz nc
i an exhihiti or  of
 an Fnl
 \
rto
 
open in 1998  (with accompanying procframs  of perforr T c s,
 
lectures,  and films,  that will  include Armenian American
 
folk artists),  planning forums on the issues of culture
 
commerce in Armenia and other former Soviet Union repu
 
editing a hook on Armenian folk art a
rid traditional  cultrre
 
by Armenian scholars to he published by  Indiana Univerrit'
 
Press  in 1997,  and forming a crafts-r
n
 ti
cx  program Li th
 
United States  for artisans  in Armeri .
 
Nancy Sweezy has been a professional  active at meetings of
 
the American Folklore Society,  a frequent  folklife panelist
 
for state arts agencies and the NEA,  and a consultant  for
 
documentary films and site evaluator for foiklife projects.
 
Other public folklorists have done these things,  but her
 
dedicated and imaginative projects have provided a unigi e
 
service to traditional  artists and arts.

Dear Bess,
 
y major motivation for writing to you is to get Corey 's address;
 
X; Tel. etc.  During the wonderful evening at Marcia Berman's
 
that I spent with Naomi & John, Naomi did not have Corey's address
 
with her & was all packed ready to leave to visit with her the next
 
morning -
 so I never got the info.
 
I
'm trying -
 I
'm not sure why (notalgia maybe) -
 to make contact with
 
as many Dance Centerites as I con locate. And now I have yours. (
I
 
think I got it from Marcia.)
 
I was just thrilled with what Naomi has done with her life and from
 
the  little I
've heard, you too are living it fully. The next time
 
that I get to the East coast, USA, I
'll get in touch and maybe yo u 
will  j
$0 have time for a cup of tea. I
'll be doing a  workshop
 
in Petaluma for C
1N in Oct. Do you plan to be there? Jenny Vincent
 
(New Mexico) is also planning to bethere. She andl have been,c in
 
constant touch. (You can tell that I
've been resistigg computers.)
 
Now that you are on the Dance Center list that I am gradually
 
accruing, you will soon be getting an announcement of my la
 
project. A good friend in L.A. has promised to get them out.
 
I have been living here on a kibbutz for the past 11 years.
 ij
 
surprise to me. I have always been fascinated & drawn to the
 
concept of collective community life and since I had family here,
 
I visited., and visited., and created programs.. & created a
 
demand for my work both off and on the kibbutz.., and fell in love
 
and before I knew it, I was living here. I travel for work
 
and play to U.S.A.; to every patt of the world in which I am in-
vited to do workshops. Life is full and good and full of adventure.
 
June 15, 1996
 
Please let me here from you. And ask me for any connections you
 
might want to make. I
'm becoming a one-woman network.
 
Much love to you and anyone who might remember,

Dear Don Moser,
 
We do seem to be involved in an irritable correspondence,  and
 
I admit  I started it -
-
 looking back over my original letter,
 
it  seems not only inflamed but  inflammatory,  and I thought  I
 
should tell you  I regret that.  I must,  however,  take
 
exception to one of the points in your answer that troubles
 
me,  and after I' m over that particular difficulty,  I can
 
cheerfully agree to disagree with you and leave it at that.
 
The exception involves the term "disdain".  I must assure you
 
I feel no disdain whatever for the National Square Dance
 
folks.  I do disagree with them.  I think they have attempted
 
to regularize and proscribe an art  form that truly belonged
 
not to them but to all inheritors of the Anglo-Irisn
 
tradition.  I think they have allowed themselves to be
 
affected by monetary considerations that they' ve not  shared
 
with their membership.  I think they claim to be more than
 
they are;  they do not,  in my half-century observation,
 
represent  square dancing in the United States.  But  I have
 
told them all this,  many times.  I have met with these folks
 
many times and danced with them and intellectually wrestled
 
with them.  They know me.  As opponents,  we respect each other.
 
How could I feel "disdain"  for them?
 
Ironically,  the thing that that  caused me undue anger in your
 
presentation of square dancing was what  I felt was your
  
disdain for these people.  There were so many kinds of square
 
dancing you could have pictured,  but you chose to emphasize
 
in your pictorial coverage the Betty Boop commercialized
 
image.  You didn't print pictures of the American Square Dance
 
Society doing anything else -
-
 and they do lots of things,
 
including board meetings -
-
 nor the thousands of localized
 
non-costumed square dances that take place across the nation.
 
You emphasized the photographically cutesey in your pictures
 
and that made square dancing look silly and it made me mad.  I
 
thought  it was unworthy of the Smithsonian and that  it was
 
important to say so.  I just wish I had said it better.
 
You really don't have to answer this letter.  Perhaps one day
 
we might want to engage in a different  interchange.
 
Sincerely,
 
Bess Lomax Hawes

the story,  too;  I found it unexpectedly delightful,  with just
 
enough of the machinery showing through to ground the
 
enchantment.  She's clever,  ain't she?
 
I wish I had some consoling words for you--it seems we are
 
both seeking consolation from one another.  I can imagine,  I
 
think,  how it must feel to watch your agency in effect disappear,
 
and to watch the struggle that Dan and Barry must be having to
 
redefine themselves.  Remember that your work has not,  and cannot,
 
be undone--that was the whole point of  it.  Arid eventually  it will
 
tell upon our collective situation.
 
I will say,  though:  I sense a subtle,  perhaps vanishingly
 
subtle,  change in the atmosphere.  It  isn't systemic,  of course,
 
nothing profound--but the Republicans seem to have gone too far,
 
from hypocrisy and double-dealing into indecency.  Even the
 
uninformed voter seems to be sensitive to that.  Who knows what
 
the outcome will be.  The deep problems are elusive,  maddeningly
 
so.  Just articulating the problem is hard enough;  thinking
 
through to some positive solution,  some genuine action,  seems
 
impossible.
 
Thanks for the good words and the good suggestions on When
 
We.  Lydia feels the same as you do,  that I need to be my own
 
explicator.  I think you're right:  the problem is that I really
 
need some time to think through what I myself have said!  After
 
three years I' m just figuring out what Ethnomimesis was about.  In
 
the meantime I need to regroup,  reconfigure.  I'm working on a
 
memoir,  and may attempt some fiction or poetry--where I started
 
out,  years ago.  I'm anxious to know your disagreements,
 
especially,  though:  that's going to mean a lot.  In any case,
 
Bess,  whatever else you may read in the book,  please read the
 
Acknowledgements.  Like everything else I write,  they are
 
heartfelt.  I wanted to put them up front,  where I feel they
 
belong,  but my editor,  a very hard-boiled and headstrong lady
 
with  35 years at Harvard under her belt,  wouldn't let me.
 
I hope you are well,  and please give my best to Alan.  I miss
 
y oll
 
Lyd of course sends her fondness along with mine.

Dear Ms.  Hawes,
 
We are on the verge of publishing Robert Cantwell's book on the folk
 
revival entitled WHEN WE WERE GOOD.
 I' d love it if  I could get a few
 
words from you describing the virtues of the book as you see them.
 
Can I send you the page proofs for the book?
 
I enclose a brief description of the book here.
 
I look forward to hearing from you.
 Many thanks.
 
Best wishes,
