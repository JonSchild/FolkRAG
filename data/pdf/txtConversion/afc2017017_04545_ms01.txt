00:00:00 Kim Stryker: It won't hurt. 
00:01 Bonnie Archer: Should I be nervous? 
00:01 KS: No. It won't hurt at all. Okay. You go on, too. Okay. No? You don't want to? 
Okay. All right. This is Kim Stryker and today is Thursday, April 12th, 2018. The time is 
almost right at 3:30, and I'm sitting here with Bonnie Archer in the Zephaniah Family 
Farm Vineyard? 
00:30 BA: Farm Vineyard. Mm-hmm. 
00:31 KS: Zephaniah Farm Vineyard in Loudoun County, Virginia. Leesburg, Virginia. 
And we're gonna talk about how you came to work in wine. Originally, this was a dairy 
operation before? 
00:46 BA: It was dairy until the '80s. 
00:51 KS: And what role... How did you come into the land, the family, everything? 
00:57 BA: Bill was raised here. 
00:57 KS: Okay. 
00:58 BA: So, this was always his home. Even though his dad was military and they 
traveled a great deal. So Bill and I actually met in London. 
01:05 KS: And that's Bill Hatch? 
01:06 BA: Mm-hmm.

01:08 KS: Okay. So, this was his family home? 
01:11 BA: Mm-hmm. 
01:12 KS: Gotcha. So, you met in London? 
01:13 KS: Yes. 
01:14 KS: What were you doing there? 
01:14 BA: Our dads were working there. 
01:16 KS: Oh, okay. 
01:17 BA: So, we were in high school, came back, went to different universities, and 
then married here on the farm. 
01:24 KS: Oh wow. 
01:25 BA: Yeah. So, there is the range of our family pictures. So, Bill and I are on the 
left. Obviously a different era and our three kids all chose to be married here. 
01:36 KS: That's so great. 
01:37 BA: And it was their choice to take their pictures in the same place that we took 
ours. 
01:42 KS: Wow. That's very cool. 
01:42 BA: Yeah. I really love that. [laughter] 
01:46 KS: That is great. 
01:48 BA: It means something worked well. 
01:48 KS: Right? 
01:49 BA: Yeah. 
01:49 KS: And they're all so engaged with the farm still? 
01:53 BA: Indeed. Well, they grew up here and so it was very much a part of their lives. 
It's not something that you just leave, I think. 
02:04 KS: Well, it sounds like you've created a responsibility to the farm a little bit in 
your approach to it. 
Winery Workers in Virginia

02:15 BA: I think they always understood farming. So, they're in their 30s, so they 
remember when it was still a dairy. They were small kids, but they remember that. They 
knew that their grandfather got up at 3:00, milked cows, and drove to the Pentagon every 
day. And that that was part of farming life. You needed backup, you needed a profession 
and the passion for farming. Every Sunday when we were kids, we walked this farm, and 
found areas, and cool things on the farm. So, that was just a part of what we did. I think 
it's how you regard the land. I mean, all that's really romantic stuff... 
03:03 KS: Yeah. Yeah. 
03:06 BA: But you know, part of the reason that we wanted to start a vineyard, was that 
wine really celebrates the land on which it's grown. And the idea that we can create a 
vineyard and grow grapes that become wine and represent this place is magic to me. I 
mean, it's not just an agricultural business. Friends of ours just sent us pictures of our 
wine on a restaurant table in Sydney, Australia. 
03:41 KS: Oh, how cool. 
03:42 BA: They had moved back to Australia, but they were celebrating their parents' 
anniversary and they knew that that would matter to us and I loved it. 
03:49 KS: Yeah. 
03:50 BA: It's just, here we are, part of people's lives because wine is about celebrating 
events. 
03:55 KS: Right. 
03:58 BA: And we get to be represented, or the land gets to be represented in that. 
04:01 KS: Right. So, what was... Did Bill's father have a name for the dairy that was 
here? 
04:10 BA: It was always Mill Road Farm. 
04:12 KS: Mill Road Farm? 
04:13 BA: Mm-hmm. 
04:15 KS: So at what point, you said up until the '80s it was the dairy... How did the 
transition to becoming a vineyard, and making wine happen? 
04:28 BA: Well, we're still part of Mill Road Farm. So, we're on Mill Road Farm. That's 
the legal name of the farm. But we planted, 16 years ago last week, was our first planting. 
I know because it was spring break. That's the only time I had a chance to do that. We 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
4 
 
really sort of paid attention to that, that it's been 16 years, and that's something that we 
really do celebrate. 
 
04:54 KS: Right. It's like raising a child [laughter] to mostly adulthood. 
 
05:00 BA: And we've been planting yesterday and today, and I did a post, but Bill and I 
talked about it, how planting grapes is really an optimistic act. It's not like tomatoes, 
where in a couple months you get to eat them. It's like, "Okay let's wait three years and 
then we can harvest, and then five years, you have a bottle." So, it's this long-term thing 
that is very different from the way we live now. We don't do much that's long term or... 
 
05:27 KS: Yeah, and trusting that far into the future. 
 
05:30 BA: Yeah, and just being optimistic. I was talking with [05:32] Tremain last time, 
my son, and he said, "You know, not only are we planting today, but those vines are 
gonna last 25 or 30 years." And so... 
 
05:42 KS: Other people may come along and... 
 
05:46 BA: Yeah. Right. Yeah, he makes sure he takes his daughter to the vineyard every 
time he visits. So, she's got a sense of that too. 
 
05:52 KS: And she's a little peanut now, right? She's two... 
 
05:53 BA: Yes. Well, she's two. She can walk through. [laughter] 
 
05:55 KS: Yeah, okay. 
 
05:57 BA: But I think that's lovely that she is growing with his sense of that, too. 
 
06:06 KS: So in the '80s, you were phasing out and decided to do the vineyard. What did 
you have to do to prepare for that? Did you know anything about it going into it? 
 
[laughter] 
 
#collaboration #community #winegrowers #hardwork #climatechange #risk #freeze 
 
06:21 BA: No, not much. Fortunately, as I'm sure you've heard from everybody, it's an 
incredibly collaborative community. So you just talk to people and learn. But we wanted 
to do it differently. And I think it's because we've spent decades here that we didn't 
wanna hire a consultant, we didn't wanna hire a grower and we didn't wanna hire a wine 
maker. If you do it yourself you learn to make the decisions and you learn to really know 
as much as you can. And, as a teacher, there are opportunities to learn every season. I 
mean, you don't quit. You don't stop. And that, to me, is wonderful. I mean, frustrating. I 
can't control the weather and climate change. But I can be more watchful. And I thought, 
living here forever, almost, that I really was tuned into nature. Hyper-tuned into nature

when you grow grapes, because you have to worry all the time. 
[laughter] 
07:21 KS: Right. 
 
07:24 BA: There's monitors all over the vineyard. Alarms sound in our bedroom when it 
gets to 33. You get to worry. 
 
07:31 KS: So what do you do? 
[laughter] 
07:34 BA: I don't hire helicopters to hover over the vineyard, although people do which 
is... 
 
07:38 KS: I've heard about the helicopters. 
 
07:42 BA: Well, that's amazing. It's very science-fiction looking. It's very cool. Bill and I 
have been known to drive our Subarus up and down the road so that the cold won't settle. 
It's better than fretting. 
 
07:55 KS: Right. So instead of helicopters, you have Subarus. 
[laughter] 
08:00 BA: Yeah. I think it might work. 
 
08:02 KS: Well, I know in some orchards, they'll build fires or they'll have heaters. 
 
08:07 BA: Yeah, right. Well the wind tunnels. All those things to try to keep the cold 
really from settling. So at least I'm doing something. 
 
08:15 KS: Yeah. How did you do this spring? Last year, I know it was that really awful, 
we had a really big warm-up, or way too early. 
 
08:26 BA: Right. 
 
08:27 KS: And then a freeze late. And a lot of people had damage from that. 
 
08:30 BA: Well, it's been so cold. I mean, again, we've had the coldest March two years 
in a row than February which is not the proper order of things. 
 
08:39 KS: Right.

Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

08:41 BA: So the vines aren't coming to life yet. So we just finished pruning. So that's 
much later than we would have. We have to worry until Mother's Day. This is the... Same 
as gardening. You don't put fragile flowers out until Mother's Day, even though 
everybody does 'cause they want it to look beautiful, but... 
 
08:58 KS: But you wouldn't think, I guess maybe the lay person wouldn't think that 
grapevines would be so fragile. They seem... 
 
09:06 BA: Oh, but they are. 
 
09:07 KS: Seem gnarly and tough and... 
 
09:09 BA: Well, but they're cut back. They look like sticks. We took a picture of Bill 
holding a new vine yesterday. They are sticks with roots. It looks like it would do 
nothing. It's a complete act of faith to put it in the ground and say, "Okay, maybe this will 
work." 
 
[laughter] 
 
09:29 KS: Right. 
 
09:29 BA: So you spend thousands of dollars on these sticks with roots and hope that it 
will come to be. Really... Yeah. 
 
09:39 KS: So when you're planting, how many did you put in or are you putting in this 
season? 
 
09:44 BA: We're doing a thousand vines. 
 
09:48 KS: And they get planted how far apart from each other? 
 
09:51 BA: We don't do what most other people are doing. We started with really wide 
rows because we had farm tractors, not vineyard tractors. So people are maximizing 
space, whereas we do widely-spaced vines and rows so farm tractors can still go up and 
down them. But it allows more air circulation, which is valuable in a humid area, which 
this certainly is. 
 
10:20 KS: Yeah, I could see, which is our big problem, yeah. 
 
10:23 BA: I mean, do you wanna stand in a big room or an elevator? Grapes take 
advantage of that, too. 
 
10:28 KS: Yeah, no, that makes sense. I hadn't heard that particular argument made for 
it. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
7 
 
10:34 BA: Well, it just seems... Healthier vines. 
 
10:37 KS: Yeah. I've definitely seen some vineyards that still use larger tractors so they 
have wider plantings as well, but not that justification for it, which makes a lot of sense. 
 
10:46 BA: Well, it seems to work. 
[laughter] 
10:50 BA: This time it's working. 
 
10:51 KS: Yeah. Right? 
 
10:55 BA: But I understand wanting to maximize land because land is valuable and 
expensive. 
 
10:58 KS: Right, especially when you're growing grapes in Loudoun County as opposed 
to some corner of Southwest Virginia where you could get things for a fraction of the... 
Obviously here because this was where the family farm was, but what made you think 
that it could work here? 
 
 
#LoudounCounty #priceofland #hills #granite #soil #Willowcroft #winepioneers 
#vinifera 
 
11:17 BA: Well, because we've watched the land for a long time. We use the tops of 
hills. So not where... You've been driving in the morning and seen the fog rolling around. 
Well, we avoid all the places where the fog could settle, because that's where the cold 
will settle. So, it really use the tops of hills so that the vines can be more protected. And 
it's been a farm for hundreds of years. It's good soil, and we've got granite underneath. 
And so it really is productive soil in that way. And it's... 
 
11:52 KS: So you didn't have somebody come out and test or... 
 
11:57 BA: Well, we knew the soil. 
[laughter] 
12:00 KS: Right... 
 
12:00 BA: 'Cause it's been farmed. 
 
12:03 KS: Just the base... Yeah. 
 
12:04 BA: But now, we'd pay more attention to that. And we didn't really know what to 
pay attention to. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

12:08 KS: Right. But you were in the beginning of everybody in Virginia doing... I 
mean, there weren't a whole lot of examples to even work off of when you were getting 
started. 
 
 
#winedrinkinginFrance #drinkingages #Europe #alcohol 
 
12:16 BA: Well, there were people like Willowcroft, he was the pioneer in Loudoun 
County and he is nearby. So, we knew that it was happened. Bill had noted an article in 
the local paper at that point about the first planting of vinifera grapes which was actually 
at the edge of Fauquier County, and he was very intrigued by that, "Look, there's 
something new happening." But that was just always a dream area. And then, "Look, 
people were doing it," and it seemed a possibility and great fun. [chuckle] I think, when 
you travel even a bit and have good meals, wine's a part of it. And that wine, again, starts 
to represent that place. Remember that wine we had in France. Remember that place in 
Italy where we had that wine that was cheaper than water, and it was excellent. And just 
seeing the way people do it in other countries is remarkable, where it's a staple and a part 
of the community, and you have co-ops of wine, and you see kids picking up wine in 
milk bottles that they carry on their bikes. 
 
13:39 KS: Yeah, the big jugs and... Yeah. 
 
13:41 BA: And more people are more responsible because that's the attitude toward 
alcohol. That's part of it too. 
 
13:48 KS: It's not like you're penting everything up for the weekend and going bananas. 
It's just an everyday part of life thing. 
 
13:55 BA: Yeah. It was odd. When Bill and I were teenagers in London, we could go to 
the pub. Then we came back here and then suddenly we were not of age, and a lot of 
people go berserk over alcohol because it was that forbidden, and then they went nuts. I 
think it's much saner not to have that attitude. 
 
14:21 KS: Yeah, like the whole prohibition thing that we had, there's so many laws and 
things that are even still on the books that you're like, "What? That makes no sense. Why 
is that the... " 
 
14:35 BA: But I wish Americans could be more sensible about alcohol and more 
reasonable and... 
 
14:38 KS: Yeah, but we don't tend to be sensible about a lot of things. 
[laughter] 
14:44 BA: No. I guess not. But it would be nice. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
9 
 
 
14:47 KS: It would be nice. It would be nice. 
 
14:49 BA: If people wouldn't find it such a forbidden and then they're excessive about it. 
 
14:56 KS: Yeah, yeah. So, tell me a little bit about the room that we're sitting in right 
now. 
 
#history #oldhouse #tasting room #parents #cattle #family #craftsmanship #woodwork 
 
15:02 BA: This is what we call the new-ish part of the house. 
 
15:05 KS: Okay. 
 
15:06 BA: So, that doorway where the clock is, is 1819, and this is 1950. 
 
15:13 KS: Oh. So very modern. 
15:15 BA: Well, new-ish. [chuckle] 
15:16 KS: Yeah, yeah. 
15:18 BA: But this part of the house, Bill's parents moved in here, they were 30 years 
old, and they moved in New Year's Day 1950, and they milked cows in another farm in 
the morning, moved them here in the afternoon. So not only did they move their three 
kids but they moved a herd of cattle too... 
 
15:37 KS: Oh my goodness. 
 
15:38 BA: Which is really remarkable. But my mother-in-law was 30 when she designed 
this room to match the rest of the house. 
 
15:45 KS: Oh, wow. 
 
15:45 BA: And I think that's quite cool. And she made it happen. And she could find at 
that time... 
 
15:54 KS: Craftsmen. 
 
15:54 BA: Artists, craftsmen who could really still do that. I would be very hard-pressed 
to find people now who could do sort of the mantle work [16:04] today. 
 
16:04 KS: Yeah. There's very intricate work on the mantel piece and the moldings, and 
things. 
 
16:09 BA: Yeah. I find it remarkable that some of the woodwork in the 1819 is as it is. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

The doorway between the two parlors, the frame is a different design on each side, and 
that's so curious to me. It's such a practical era. One of my favorite things about the house 
is they built a kiln here and used the very clay soil to make the bricks to make the house. 
 
16:36 KS: Wow. 
 
16:38 BA: So talk about being intrinsic to the land. [chuckle] And maybe it was just the 
practicality that they couldn't get further away to another kiln. So, you couldn't ship in 
bricks or buy 'em from... 
 
16:51 KS: Right. And I think you take it for granted when you live here but... Here 
generally. But brick is so, like that red brick is so identified with Virginia. When people 
come from somewhere else they're like, "All this red brick, this is so... " 
 
17:08 BA: It's the clay soil. [chuckle] 
 
17:10 KS: It's very different from other parts of the country. And I think we just assumed 
that that's just generic or normal that... 
 
17:14 BA: Right. 
 
17:17 KS: Yeah. So the house, the old part of the house is from the 18... 
 
17:20 BA: 1819. 
 
17:21 KS: 1819. And so, it was always Bill's family that lived here? 
 
17:26 BA: Well, they were the second family to live here. So, they moved in 1950. So 
the first family, the Nixon family, those are Quaker family from Bucks County. 
 
17:34 KS: Gotcha. 
 
 
#deed #oldhouse #parchment #family #indenture 
 
17:35 BA: I found the original deed to this house upstairs in a box of bills. Bill's parents 
were lovely but not well-organized. [chuckle] So it was like electric bill, gas bill, original 
deed to the house. 
 
17:48 KS: Oh my God. 
 
17:48 BA: And it was folded, it was parchment, and it looked a bit like origami, and I 
started unfolding it and I realized it was parchment, and written on both sides which is 
very peculiar for... 
 
18:01 KS: Right. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
11 
 
 
18:02 BA: But they were frugal Quakers, so, sure. 
 
18:03 KS: Yeah, yeah. We don't wanna waste... 
 
18:05 BA: That's grandfather to grandson. It was an indenture that meant that he had to 
farm this land. 
 
18:10 KS: Wow. 
 
18:10 BA: And we still do. Yeah. 
 
18:13 KS: So that's interesting because... So, one of the things, and it's a theme that keeps 
coming up in things that you're talking about. When I talk to the Striblings and I talked to 
one of the older members of the family who's sort of the family historian, he has the 
framed deed from Lord Fairfax of their family... Their earliest ancestor who took a lease 
on the land, and it was required to plant 100 apple trees. 
 
18:48 BA: Oh, interesting. 
 
18:49 KS: For very much the same reason what you were saying about grapes as an 
investment in the future, as part of the colonizing effort for the New World, the British 
landowners were requiring tenants to plant apple trees because they hoped that would 
force them to want to stay and put down roots longer. 
 
19:13 BA: Oh, indeed? 
 
19:13 KS: Because then they would have to wait for the literally the fruit of their labors. 
 
19:16 BA: Right? Real roots. [chuckle] 
 
19:18 KS: Rather than push further West where they could get free land and have to 
encounter Native Americans and do all sorts of other things. But they could push West 
for free, so they had to actually think of incentivizing ways for them to rent land. Because 
the impulse was more and more to go further West. In Virginia, the colonies of Virginia, 
they had to really coax people or trick them into deals that would keep them on the land. 
And I think that's why in particular, in the Fauquier region and in Loudoun, you had these 
huge parcels that stayed in families for hundreds of years. Because those people, a lot of 
times, were given land as a gift because their ancestors were friends with Lord Fairfax or 
something. And then the real scrappy pioneer folks were the ones who couldn't even 
afford to rent land, so they just pushed out into the West. 
 
#LordFairfaxdeeds 
 
20:23 BA: Yeah. It's remarkable. Well, this was called wilderness. We have a copy of 
one of the Lord Fairfax deeds. And it was just deemed wilderness because it had never 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
12 
 
been cultivated before. 
 
20:39 KS: Right. 
 
20:39 BA: So you had forest. It was in the way. 
 
20:40 KS: To clear the land, yeah, that was not preferable. If you could find cleared land, 
that would be much more desirable, I'm sure, yeah. Yeah. It's hard to think... 
 
20:49 BA: But then you have to do it yourself, you know. Yeah. 
 
20:55 KS: So what do you like about doing this kind of work? You said a little bit about 
it. 
 
#fundamentalwork #love #vineyard #beautiful #thunderstorms #growing #meetingpeople 
#qualityoflife 
 
21:01 BA: It's fundamental work and you really get to pay attention and heed it. You 
know, our ritual for the growing season is that Bill and I drive up and down every row of 
the vineyard every evening. Our dog runs behind us, so he gets exercise too. But it's just a 
curious thing 'cause when you're working in a vineyard, you tend to be in one area, one 
varietal, one row, one area. But you need to be very watchful of what's going on in the 
vineyard. So it's just our evening ritual. It's sort of a pleasant time. Drive up and down the 
rows, we look carefully at all the vines and see how things are progressing. But you really 
get to observe on a daily basis. But it's usually lovely. It's evening in the summertime on 
the farm. 
 
21:56 KS: Right. 
 
21:58 BA: Now, granted we're driving in the car. It's not a convertible or... 
[chuckle] 
22:05 KS: What about the nights when there's a thunderstorm? Are you still out there? 
Or... 
 
22:10 BA: No, not... We do have the thunderstorm rule. 'Cause thunderstorms can been 
fairly a bit dramatic here. But yeah, unless it's pouring rain, I'd say we're out there. And 
then we would be out the next morning to see what the rain had done, if we missed it the 
night before. But I don't think that people have the pleasure of watching things in nature 
that closely. I love the garden and it's beautiful. It comes to life. And I was out checking 
plants this morning, how are they doing with the cold. But the vineyard is something that 
is also gonna sustain us. We get to have a tasting room and see people I would never 
encounter in my regular life. 
 
22:55 KS: If your lilies don't come up. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
13 
 
 
22:57 BA: It's not a big part... 
 
22:57 KS: It's sad that the lilies didn't come up. They are very pretty, but it's not gonna, 
yeah, not pay the rent or whatever. 
 
23:01 BA: No, it's not gonna harm us. 
 
23:04 KS: Yeah, no, I get that. So there's, in some ways you're like a partner with these 
plants. 
 
23:12 BA: Yes. 
 
23:12 KS: And you really have a relationship where you rely on them. 
 
 
#weather #risk #climatechange #grapestaketime #timebyvintages 
 
23:16 BA: And the weather, which is increasingly a puzzle. We have had weather that 
we've not had before. The patterns are odd. We can't predict what the year will be. We 
just know to worry a lot about it. When it's in the 70s in February, and then in the 20s in 
March. Things are amiss. And we need to pay attention to that as well. So, I'm the one 
who writes my legislators to say, "In the consideration of climate change, please talk to 
people who are growing things in your state." Because we've had to... We grow different 
grapes now than we did 16 years ago. 
 
24:03 KS: Yeah. 
 
24:04 BA: I'm not gonna grow a grape that susceptible to cold, that's silly. 
 
24:10 KS: It does also seem like there's sort of an assumption like, "Oh, well, the weather 
pattern will change and we'll just grow stuff somewhere else." You can just grow bananas 
in Alaska 'cause it'll be warm enough. Like as if you could just pick up a whole operation 
and drop it somewhere else. 
 
24:28 BA: Maybe other products are quick and one season deals, but grapes are not that. 
 
24:33 KS: Yeah. 
 
24:34 BA: I mean, we rarely know what year it is because we've got years' worth of wine 
in barrels, then we bottle it two years later, and then we hold it for a year and then. I've 
got 13s and 14s on the shelf and, "Oh, but it's 18." [laughter] It's a very time warp 
profession, I think. 
 
25:00 KS: Yeah, losing track of years. Literally. 
Winery Workers in Virginia

25:03 BA: Well, I mean you know what's going on. You label the barrels carefully, but 
it's still sort of a real hodgepodge of vintages. 
 
25:13 KS: Yeah, that's one of the points that several people have made, too, is that what's 
unique about Virginia wine is that each vintage is completely a different thing than the 
one before, even if it's the same varietal and you do everything exactly the same, but 
because of our weather variation that you don't have in a place like California, where the 
whole point is consistency in product. Here we don't have that, but then you have these 
unexpectedly fun things happen. 
 
 
#vintages #blends #wine #impermanence #variabilityinvintages #consistency 
 
25:46 BA: But then you have great vintages. And every vintage is distinct. I've learned 
now to warn people when I'm gonna switch vintage because they want consistency too, if 
they love a vintage, they get very upset when the new one is quite different. And we 
blend most of our wines, so we can really change that year to year. But it causes a bit of a 
panic. "What do you mean you don't have that anymore?" Well, not everything is 
permanent. [laughter] 
 
26:19 KS: Right. They're all endangered species. 
 
26:20 BA: Enjoy what... Enjoy what's there. 
 
26:22 KS: They're all endangered species a bit, yeah. 
 
26:23 BA: Yeah. And it should not, you know... Buy grocery store wine if you want it to 
taste the same, 'cause they'll manipulate it to make it taste like that. But this really does 
speak to the year and capture the year and I think that's romantic and cool. 
 
26:38 KS: Yeah, that was I think one of the points. I was talking to... Oh, here we go. 
That's the big clock. [old grandfather clock chimes] 
 
[laughter] 
 
26:45 BA: You know I never hear it, but I see people hear it. 
 
26:49 KS: Reacting to it, yeah. 
 
26:50 BA: I'm so used to it I just don't... 
 
26:51 KS: It's almost like a train is coming in the station or something. 
[laughter] 
26:54 BA: [26:54] Lori's say, "Is it closing time now?" [laughter] No. No, it's just the

[laughter] 
27:00 BA: Oh, sometimes not. 
[laughter] 
 
#training #conferences #winemaking #growers #collaborative #mentoring 
 
27:04 KS: So, did you have to do any kind of special training, or like, you said it was 
mostly just talking to people and trying things out? But did you ever take any courses or 
do anything, reading up special things or... 
 
27:16 BA: We go to conferences. We talk to people there. We certainly read as much as 
we can. Try to keep up with what's going on among the wine makers and growers. But 
again, it's a very collaborative community. People wanna share and if they find a grape 
that's growing well or a nursery that's doing a particularly good job everybody tells 
people. I'm sorry that other businesses don't function like that in a very collaborative 
nature. And it's sort of at odds with the rest of the country now, because people aren't 
very collaborative these days. 
 
27:52 KS: Right, very competitive, or, yeah. 
 
27:54 BA: At least in the wine world we are. There'll always be outliers. Any group will 
have that. But I think it's marvelous that it's so collaborative. 
 
28:10 KS: Yeah, no, that's definitely something that I've heard over and over and over 
again. And I think it's helped a lot of people get into it that might have been too 
intimidated or overwhelmed by the amount to learn, to be able to lean on, or talk to, or go 
to advice from someone who's been there, done that. 
 
28:26 BA: Right. 
 
28:27 KS: Yeah. 
 
28:27 BA: Yeah. 
 
28:29 KS: So, what is the thing that you think that we were talking about a little bit... 
You would like people to be out in the vineyard so they can really see the process. 
 
28:43 BA: Right. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
16 
 
28:44 KS: What are the things that you think people don't understand about wine, 
making an agricultural product like wine? 
 
 
#misunderstandings #winemaking #harvest #publicconfusion 
 
28:50 BA: Well, I don't really know where their misconceptions come from because they 
often say, "Well, how many times a year do you harvest?" And I don't know many crops 
that are like that unless you were in a consistent season that was always the same 
temperature, so you could continually harvest. 
 
29:10 KS: Like in the tropics or something. 
 
29:12 BA: Yeah. I don't know what agricultural product maybe, is there one? 
[laughter] 
29:18 KS: Pineapples, maybe? [laughter] 
 
 
#optimism #growingthings #philosophy #magic #errors #rainatharvest 
 
29:21 BA: But they believe that it's a constant sort of thing, even though when they get 
out of their cars they can see things that look like sticks in the wintertime and are not 
lively. I mean, they are, but they don't demonstrate that. But I would like them... You 
know, I always try to post Instagram pictures and things like that and on Facebook, so 
that they can see what's going on at this moment in the vineyard. But to get them up 
there, they really see that. I mean that... It's great that we've got people who come here 
frequently who realize that in two weeks vines look different and it's sort of magic, spring 
is optimistic. But I think growing things is optimistic. 
 
30:05 KS: Yeah, being a farmer is definitely something you have to... 
 
30:12 BA: Yeah. Sort of scary hope. [laughter] 'Cause things can go amiss. 
 
30:17 KS: Yeah, for sure. Was there anything that you can recall, a situation where you 
guys just totally missed the ball on something, or just had a big goof up in the vineyard? 
 
30:32 BA: I don't think we've made errors. Nature has made errors. Everybody talks 
about '11. That was the year that we didn't really make wine. It rained for days and days. I 
think it was 44 days at the end of the season. It was horrible. And I'm not gonna make 
wine that's bad. And in a day your vines can change. Your grapes... If it's harvested and 
they're ready, and you're gonna harvest tomorrow, and it rains two inches. It's a sad thing. 
 
31:05 KS: It's a sad thing. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
17 
 
31:06 BA: Yeah, you watch the sugar disappear, and the acid, and the taste is bloated and 
diluted. 
 
31:14 KS: Nothing you can do about it. 
 
31:15 BA: Yeah. 
 
31:16 KS: You either pick it... 
 
31:17 BA: Well, you just... I'm not gonna make wine from bad grapes, so... It's not worth 
it. 
 
31:23 KS: So what happens? Do you just compost it all, or toss it? 
 
31:26 BA: Well, you know, the cows eat grapes. [laughter] 
 
31:32 KS: Cows are all excited that day. 
 
 
#quality #winemaking #patience 
31:37 BA: They were, yeah. No, I'm not gonna make bad wine. I'm not gonna make a 
bad vintage. I'd rather not do it, than... 
 
31:43 KS: Yeah, but you can see how people would out of desperation. 
 
31:46 BA: Sure. But it's always... It's not like you're gonna make money this year unless 
you're selling grapes. You're gonna make money three years from now on that vintage. 
So, again, it's a patience exercise. And you learn more about that because... Which is why 
we kept our jobs. 
 
32:08 KS: Yeah, right. Is Bill still working as well? 
 
32:13 BA: He's working today. 
 
32:14 KS: And what does he do? 
 
 
#husband #ABCNews 
32:17 BA: He works for ABC News. 
 
32:18 KS: Okay. 
 
32:19 BA: And it's sort of a big news time. Today's he's at an extra job. He's doing the 
Cherry Blossom Festival. 
 
32:26 KS: Oh, my gosh. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017

32:27 BA: It's four days in DC, televising that. Yeah. 
 
32:31 KS: And trying to keep all of this going. 
 
32:32 BA: Yes, so we're just calling him and reporting in. Well, and honestly, election 
years, we just send him videos. I mean, he misses the harvest because he's gone all 
summer. 
 
32:44 KS: 'Cause it's right in the middle of that season. So, how did you juggle it? I 
guess it helped that you had your summers off as a teacher. 
 
32:53 BA: Mm-hmm, yes indeed. [chuckle] I'm sure. 
 
32:55 KS: That's the most labor-intensive time. 
 
#worklifebalance #family #SpringBreak #summer #wineschedule #harvest #labor 
 
32:56 BA: That's why we plan it at spring break. 
 
32:58 KS: Right. You plan it spring break and then you can do canopy management, pest 
control and everything that you have to do during the summer. 
 
33:05 BA: Yeah. Sure. 
 
33:06 KS: But then harvest, he's off. Kids are back in school. 
33:09 BA: Right. And we have good people who help us do that. 
33:12 KS: So you have to bring in people to help? 
33:13 BA: Yeah, absolutely. 
 
33:14 KS: And then for the actual bottling and stuff, do you also just bring in a crew to 
help with that, or? 
 
 
#mobilebottlingline #labor #friends #communityeffort 
 
33:23 BA: We bring in a mobile bottling line. We provide the crew except for the folks 
who come with the bottling line. But those are... 
 
[overlapping conversation] 
 
33:30 KS: They usually have like two guys. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
19 
 
33:31 BA: Yeah. We bring in people, our friends help us with that, and they have been 
for years. 
 
33:37 KS: That's great, yeah. So it's a community effort? 
 
33:41 BA: Well, we test our new wines on our friends. 
 
33:43 KS: Right. 
 
 
#winemakingtenets #dontmakewinewewontserveourfriends #kitchentest #friends 
 
33:45 BA: As Bill probably said, one of our tenets is that we never make a wine that we 
don't serve for our friends. That's vital to us. There are people who make sort of 
commercial wines, but they don't enjoy them and they would not share them with their 
friends. And for us, we call it the kitchen test. So we pull a bottle from the barrel, give it 
to our friends, who have been with us since this was a dream, and they test it in their own 
kitchens. Because when you drink wine with friends or at a lovely place, the experience 
overrides your ability. I call it the "What was I thinking" mode. 
 
[chuckle] 
 
34:35 BA: I've been to places where it was beautiful and I was with nice friends, and I 
bought a bottle of wine and then I got it home to my own kitchen and went, "What was I 
thinking." It was an error, and I never wanna make any error. So, our friends don't 
experience it for the first time with us. They have to drink it in their own kitchens. 
 
34:57 KS: Oh, okay. 
 
34:58 BA: And so that's the kitchen test. 
 
35:00 KS: It's their kitchen test. 
 
35:00 BA: If it passes their kitchen test in their own environment and they still... And 
they report back to us. And that's invaluable. 
 
35:08 KS: Yeah, definitely. 
 
35:10 BA: It's really vital to us 'cause it's not just our taste or our family's taste. It's gotta 
be a broader thing. 
 
35:16 KS: Do you ever do tastings with other wineries? 
#tastings #dontgetoutmuch #wineries #leisure 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
20 
 
35:21 BA: Rarely. Because we can't get out. Well, now, since I retired, we're open 
Friday, Saturday, Sunday. And that's when most other wineries are open and we're 
always here when we're open. So that sort of limits getting out. 
 
35:38 BA: I definitely heard that from other people that they were like, "We loved going 
to wineries and it was something we were doing so much, so we thought why don't we 
start a winery and then we found out we can't go to wineries anymore. Because we're 
always at it!" 
 
 
#collaboration #sharing #extensionservice 
 
35:53 BA: People bring wines to meetings, so we've tasted other people's wines, 
certainly, and we can buy them, but seeing their place and their operation and the way 
they do things is incredibly valuable. And we just can't do it. Unless they're open 
Tuesdays or Thursdays. 
 
36:12 KS: Well, I know fruit tree growers, with the [36:15] extension service, they'll host 
a bunch of other fruit tree growers at, they'll do a host event at a farm, and then they'll 
walk the fields and talk about past issues and stuff like that. 
 
36:30 BA: And that still happens. 
 
36:32 KS: They do stuff like that as well in your industry? 
 
36:35 BA: Yeah, yeah. And that's a good thing. 
 
36:35 KS: I think that's really useful for... And you know that everybody wants... It's just 
like going to an open house, everybody wants to peek at each other's farms a little bit. 
"How are they doing it? I wouldn't have put that there." 
 
[laughter] 
 
#seatedtastings #difference #relax #enjoyment #winetasting #mood #linger #Yelp #quiet 
 
36:50 BA: And it is curious, the decisions that people make and other owners tell us 
we're crazy for doing this, but I really like seated tastings. I think it's the opportunity for 
people to relax a bit, and we're in this area. People really need that I think. 
 
37:10 KS: Right. I do think it... It makes you feel a little bit more comfortable to linger 
and sometimes, at some of the big... Where there's busloads coming through or whatever, 
and you feel like, "Okay, step aside, you've had your time at the tasting counter." 
 
37:25 BA: And a tasting shouldn't last 10 minutes. I can't do six wines in 10 minutes. It 
shouldn't be a speed event. Wine is really about relaxing and lingering and enjoying, and 
I think that that needs to be done in a different environment. 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
21 
 
 
37:48 KS: And you're creating a very different... I think that's... You guys particularly, 
Zephaniah, gets mentioned a lot, as this relaxing... That's the mood here, it's not... Stone 
Tower is beautiful, but it's a bit chaotic. There's a lot of people, it's really, really big, it's 
noisy. It's a very different feeling than coming to a place like this. 
 
38:14 BA: Well, the good thing is that there's so many models and so many individual 
places that people can find what they want. We had our most recent Yelp review was 
negative because it was too quiet here. And that's what I love. I like peace. Maybe it's 40 
years with teenagers and teaching, but I never liked the cafeteria much because it was 
noisy. 
 
38:44 KS: Chaotic. 
 
38:45 BA: Driving home to the farm was bliss. I mean I loved my job, absolutely, you 
can't do that if you don't love it. But it's not quiet, I crave quiet. My sister comes out, she 
lives in Gettysburg, and she comes in and she's, "Turn on the radio, I mean, we need 
sound." 
 
39:05 KS: Oh it makes her uncomfortable. 
 
39:08 BA: And people are like that, if they're always used to noise and traffic and 
busyness, this makes some people uncomfortable. This makes me really comfortable. 
 
[laughter] 
 
39:17 KS: Yeah, I can see that, no definitely. My husband's somebody who needs to be 
doing, doing, doing all the time. And so he's always got a TV on or multiple things, he's 
watching a video on his phone while the TV's on and 10 different things are going on. 
And I'm, "Can you turn one of the things off?" 
 
[chuckle] 
 
#awineryforeveryone #differentenvironments #Virginia #difference 
#sophisticatedcustomers #wanttolearn 
 
39:35 BA: But some people thrive in that environment, so the good thing about wineries 
is, people can find the environment that suits them. That's a good thing. 
 
39:50 KS: What was I gonna ask you about that? The industry in particular, in Virginia, 
it is different, it is unique, even though now we have wineries in every state of the Union, 
they're growing grapes everywhere. What is it, do you think, about Virginia that makes 
this industry particular? 
 
40:14 BA: I think we have, generally, very sophisticated customers who know wine and 
are willing to be open-minded about it and wanna learn, I think. And I think that they 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
22 
 
welcome the opportunity to relax and they enjoy it. It's like a hobby for people. People 
have been to enormous number of vineyards, so they have this basis for comparison, 
which is far beyond what I have, 'cause I don't get out much now. And the fact that it's 
still collaborative, is phenomenal. And I don't know that people sense that, I don't think, I 
don't know that people know that, but it certainly seems like a community. If people have 
not been to certain places, I really urge them to go. I have my standard of what a Virginia 
vineyard should be, and I like people to go there and see what's happening there. And 
there's some extraordinary wine in Virginia. 
 
41:29 KS: What are some of your favorite spots? 
 
#favoritewineries #GlenManor #Linden #JimLaw #growinggrapes #spirituality 
#questforexcellence 
 
41:32 BA: Glen Manor and Linden. I think Jim Law at Linden can speak about growing 
better than anybody I know. 
 
41:40 KS: I did get to sit down with him, finally. He's great. 
 
41:45 BA: He understands the spirituality of growing grapes, you know? 
 
41:50 KS: Yeah, I know, he's really amazing. He's like a Buddha. [laughter] A wine 
Buddha or something. 
 
41:55 BA: I've known him since the '80s, in a different environment entirely, but I really 
admire what he does and his quest for excellence is quite something. He's got an 
understanding of the environment and the weather that I think eludes most people. He 
wants to be in the vineyard every day and that, to me, is the mark of excellence in a 
vineyard. 
 
42:22 KS: Yeah. 
 
42:23 BA: You gotta be there. 
 
42:25 KS: Yeah. 
 
42:25 BA: And you have to be part of it and being aware of it. And he certainly is. 
 
42:30 KS: Yeah. 
 
42:31 BA: And Jeff White at Glen Manor is, I think they're a phenomenal place. 
 
42:39 KS: I've been to Linden, I haven't been to Glen Manor. 
 
42:41 BA: Oh, do go.

#standards #winequality #CabernetFranc #centuryfarm #chef #husbandandwifeteam 
 
42:50 BA: Yeah. They have standards that elude me. I wrote him a note when I tasted his 
Cab Franc, his newest finish of Cab Franc. I don't write many notes. I send a lot of emails 
and texts, but he makes wonderful... He grew [43:10] Cab Franc for 10 years. 
 
43:12 KS: Oh, okay. 
 
43:12 BA: He's on a century farm. His family has farmed that for over 100 years. 
 
43:16 KS: Oh, nice. Yeah. 
 
43:18 BA: Yeah. But he makes extraordinary wines. 
 
43:19 KS: Yeah.

[laughter] 
43:20 KS: I will, oh just give me the excuse, yeah. 
[laughter] 
43:24 BA: Just for research. 
 
43:26 KS: Yeah. 
 
43:27 BA: Yeah. She was the chef, he's the winemaker and grower.

43:32 BA: No, but they cook well.

France and...

44:14 BA: There's irony in my life, it's okay. 
 
44:17 KS: Yes, yes. I get it, I get it. And one of the things that distinguishes the different 
Winery Workers in Virginia 
afc2017/017
25 
 
types of wineries from each other are ones that do events versus... You don't do any 
events here? 
 
#events #differences #wineries #weddings #consistenthours #wineclub #verticaltasting 
 
44:33 BA: We do very select weddings. If they don't... I don't wanna close to customers 
for events. I understand that that's where the money is, and more money that grapes and 
wine bring in, but I want customers to know that they are first with us. So, closing on a 
Saturday afternoon doesn't make sense to me. 
 
44:55 KS: Right, right. 
 
44:56 BA: You have to have a consistency of opening or people just think it's higgledy- 
piggledy and that's harder for them to plan. 
 
45:04 KS: Right. So how often in a year do you think you have an event? 
 
45:12 BA: Well, we have our first wine club, which is an entirely different wine club, so 
we have quarterly events for them. 
 
45:19 KS: Okay. 
 
45:20 BA: Again, to get them closer to the process. So we just started that at the 1st of 
the year. We just had our first event and based on the fact that we had our oldest vintage 
for Christmas dinner with our family, we decided we should share it. 
 
45:39 KS: Oh, that's cool. 
 
45:39 BA: We did vertical tasting of Cab Franc from 2007 on. We have some older wine, 
but it's labeled in masking tape because we didn't have our license yet so we can't serve 
that. Yeah. 
 
45:53 KS: That would have to be like the really underground [laughter] wine club with 
the duct taped bottles. People would probably pay extra for that because it seems so cool. 
 
#vintagesmarktime #familymoments #passingiton 
 
46:05 BA: But it was nice to share 2007 and people could really... So we talked about the 
seasons that produce those wine and how we were at different stages. It was cool that we 
had a vintage from when my son came back to the farm, and then when my daughter 
came back to the area, 'cause that really embodies their participation in this, which we are 
phenomenally lucky people. We have friends our age, who have no one that they can pass 
a vineyard to because it's really hard work and their kids don't wanna do it. 
 
46:43 KS: Right.

46:44 BA: So we are so lucky that our kids our interested. 
 
46:47 KS: No, definitely. 
 
46:47 BA: They thought we were daft when we planted. "What are our parents doing 
now?" Particularly our son, who was in high school. He'd just thought.. We were 
embarrassing him once again. As parents do when their children are adolescents. Our 
daughters were in college, and I'm sure they thought we were just shooting their college 
money. 
 
47:11 KS: And yeah, what does your son do now? 
 
47:13 BA: Yes, he works in the industry. He has never said, "Oh mom, good job." 
[chuckle] 
47:20 KS: No, no. 
 
47:21 BA: But I am taking his work and his passion for it. 
 
47:25 KS: He probably is just... He probably just got all of his degrees and experience 
and learning all this stuff about wines so he could show you guys up at some point. 
[laughter] See, you were doing it all wrong. 
 
#bucketlist #NewZealand #wines bikerides 
 
47:32 BA: And he does. He did my bucket list. One of my life goals was to go to New 
Zealand and he had to study there and I've not been yet. Yeah, but I was so delighted that 
he could go. And it was the era of technology, so I could FaceTime with him. He used to 
go on these daft bike rides on the weekends. Hundred mile rides through New Zealand, 
so I needed to see him the next day. 
 
[chuckle] 
 
48:01 KS: Right. If you survived that ride. 
 
48:05 BA: A voice on the phone is very different than getting to look. 
[laughter] 
48:07 KS: Right Exactly. Are you in [unintelligible]… 
 
48:15 BA: Yeah. But I am so pleased that I was able to do that. 
 
48:18 KS: Yeah, pretty amazing.

48:18 BA: Oh, yeah. 
 
48:21 KS: So now, he's working... I'm saying this for the purpose of the recording. But, 
yeah, he's working out in Winchester, at the... What do they call it, the... 
 
 
#son #TremainHatch #AREC #VirginiaTech #research #helpsgrowers 
 
48:32 BA: It's the AREC, it's a fruit research station. So, he's a researcher for Virginia 
Tech and an adjunct there. His job is to work with new growers in the state of Virginia. 
So he goes out and helps them. 
 
48:47 KS: So he does get to go out and visit everybody? 
 
48:48 BA: Right. He does. He does. Yeah, he's ahead. 
 
48:54 KS: If you could just get him to FaceTime you now, it'd be like you can go there. 
"Bring me along on your next tour... Mom stop embarrassing me!" 
 
[laughter] 
 
 
#twins #daughetr #senseofsmell #winemaker #divisionoflabor #familybusiness 
 
49:02 BA: There's never enough. [laughter] Yeah, but that's wonderful. And our daughter 
has the best sense of smell in the family, so she's great as a wine maker, because she can 
detect things that I can't. More than her twin sister. 
 
49:19 KS: That's strange, yeah. 
 
49:22 BA: Well, they just divide it up. 
 
49:23 KS: How would you divide it up in the family, like who's the best at certain 
things? 
 
49:27 BA: Well, [49:28] Tremain is best in the vineyard because he's got more current 
research and practice, and he's certainly got a wider scope of experience than we do, 
because we know this and he knows that. Emily is wonderful in the cellar, and her twin 
sister is phenomenal in helping me with the business side, the part I don't particularly 
enjoy. She's very methodical and organized and analytical... So, that's tremendously 
helpful to me. 
 
49:54 KS: What's her name? 
 
49:57 BA: Meredith.

50:00 KS: Meredith? Okay. Meredith's spelled? 
 
50:01 BA: Meredith. 
 
50:05 KS: Okay. Sometimes there's Ys with things in there. 
[chuckle] 
50:05 BA: Like Meredyth Vineyard. 
 
50:07 KS: There you go. Okay, and then Bill's light shines doing what? 
 
50:15 BA: He's officially the winemaker. He's got the big picture on both sides. And we 
learn every vintage. How better to make wine. And that's exciting. 
 
50:28 KS: And why do you think yours is the business side, is that your... 
 
50:31 BA: Well, we always say that we blend wines as a family, which is quite a family 
activity. It's not only our kids, but their spouses. So the beer drinking son-in-law gets to 
help blend wine, which is great, because it broadens the range of tastes and backgrounds. 
The in-laws all grew up with different cuisines and different beers. [laughter] 
 
50:57 KS: Sure. Different [50:58] yeah. 
 
51:00 BA: But that's very useful. But I have the honorary second vote in our blending, so 
everybody gets one vote, I get two. 
 
51:10 KS: Oh. Very nice. 
 
51:11 BA: It works out. [chuckle] 
 
51:15 KS: So you can be a little heavy handed if you need to. 
51:19 BA: Family peace. Maybe it's just the mom thing. [laughter] 
51:20 KS: I gave birth to all of you! [chuckle] 
 
#criticalpalate #winemaking #skills #farmasburden #choice 
 
51:22 BA: Well, we call it the critical palate. And I don't mean that as the disparaging, 
just... 
 
51:30 KS: No, no, you wanna have a critical palate. And so your hope for the future is 
that your kids will wanna take it over?

51:41 BA: I do hope that, but it's gotta be their choice. It emphatically has to be their 
choice. I never want it to be a responsibility or a burden, I would like to be solvent at the 
point in which they take it over. I don't see a point... Of course we're both gonna be 70. 
There's gonna be a point that we are not as active, but that's not now. 
 
52:17 KS: That's so funny, that's such a common thing too to hear because the average 
age of a lot of vineyard owners in Virginia is... I think a lot of them are close, in their 70s. 
And they'll say, "Well, one day I'll get old. One day I'll slow down... " 
 
#newgenerationofgrowers #leadership #newandold #generations #longevity 
 
52:35 BA: A day in the vineyard sometimes, a day in planning, and you feel really old, 
but, I think 30-year olds [52:39] feel old when they do that too. But there is this new 
generation that's coming along that's a part of leadership. Nate Walsh is a prime example 
of that. He's a great grower, great wine maker, and he's at the forefront. And I think that's 
exciting, but I don't want it to be that the older people feel pushed out. Yeah, and so 
there's gotta be some finesse in that. And co-existence. 
 
53:17 KS: Yeah. Well, like you said, I think there is room for... One of the things that's 
so nice about the Virginia wine industry is that there isn't one way t do Virginia Wine or 
to have a tasting room. And so, people are used to there being a variety of options, a 
variety of wines and tastes and settings. So, the same probably could go for the wine 
makers themselves. 
 
53:42 BA: And generational knowledge is a good thing. 
 
53:51 KS: Yeah. 
 
53:51 BA: So longevity helps. But knowing the farm over decades, I think it's helpful. 
 
53:57 KS: Yeah. Very cool. Anything that you wanna add and make sure it gets on the 
record? 
 
 
#workasajoyousthing #celebration #land #care #romantic 
 
54:07 BA: Just that it can be a joyous thing. It's tremendously hard, but there's great 
celebration in... You get to celebrate the land, which is again, sounds like just a romantic 
thing. But if it's land that you care about, and a place that you care about... 
 
54:24 KS: Also, I think if you put in the work, you're allowed to say celebratory things 
about it. 
 
54:31 BA: But that it leaves here and represents that. You know some of our joy in doing 
it can go along [54:39] with that.

54:39 KS: Yeah. Right, and out the door in the bottles that people take with them. 
 
54:44 BA: And what work is ever that... I don't know, just sort of celebratory? It's not 
like anything else... I don't know the corn growers feel like that. [chuckle] Well, maybe 
they do, maybe they have that sense that they're part of people's meals and celebrations in 
that way. 
 
55:02 KS: I do get the feeling... I think it's because it's an added value product, because 
you're putting that extra... You're not just selling table grapes, you're selling something 
that you've crafted. That's a little bit different than farmers... A lot of farmers that I've 
talked to who grow a crop, they have more fun growing the crop than selling it to people 
or seeing people enjoy it necessarily, and it's for them, it's the growing that's fun. And 
they would probably grow stuff if no one was buying it. They just like to grow. I don't 
know that's the case for everybody, but that's something I've heard a lot from farmers. 
 
55:40 BA: That makes sense. 
 
55:41 KS: Yeah. 
 
55:42 BA: Yeah. Yeah. 
 
55:42 KS: They just have fun seeing things grow and making it look beautiful. 
55:46 BA: And you want your work to be fun. It would be dismal if it were not. 
55:52 KS: Right. 
#joyinprofession #worksatisfaction #workplace #change 
 
55:53 BA: And I don't know how many people have that joy in their professions. I mean, 
I [56:01] You shouldn't spend forty some years in education as just a job. It's gotta be 
something that you care tremendously about. 
 
56:10 KS: Yeah, but when you think of these people, so many... We have tech industry is 
such a huge employer around here, and you have people who are just sitting in a cube and 
they're... Maybe they feel that way. I have a hard time imagining that they do, but maybe 
they get a lot of joy out of coding and... 
 
56:27 BA: But even the workplace is changing so it's a more communal activity and 
people aren't stuck in a little small space on their own and people can work remotely 
and... 
 
56:38 KS: That's true. Yeah. 
 
56:38 BA: So I think that the atmosphere of work is changing too.

56:45 BA: Yeah. Yeah, it has to. 
[laughter] 
56:49 BA: People have to have a little more joy in life. 
56:50 KS: Yeah. Well let's end it on it being a joyous thing. 
56:55 BA: Indeed. 
56:56 KS: That's a pretty great way to end it. [chuckle] And I'll stop this so then you can 
start saying all the things that you really wanted to say.
