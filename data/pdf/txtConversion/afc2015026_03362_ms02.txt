Part 1 of 2 
 
00:00:00 
Introductions 
 
00:01:25 
Born in Mexacali, near Tijuana, 1960. 
 
00:01:50 
Parents both grew up in Mexico, father was a bookkeeper.  Marriage had 
its ups and downs.  Divorced and reunited. 
 
00:02:10 
Parents are both dead now. 
 
00:02:30 
Easy to come to US during the early 1960’s, became more difficult in late 
‘60’s, more restrictions. 
 
00:30:50 
Father came to work in Los Angeles during last separation from mother. 
 
00:04:30 
Thinks of himself as “50/50” half Mexican, half American.   
 
00:06:00 
After graduating from high school wanted to go to “air school” to become 
a pilot, but not financially possible.  Instead came to US with mother and 
went to Los Angeles. 
 
00:06:50 
Worked at car wash called “Mr. Polish, at a market, furniture company. 
 
00:07:30 
Applied for amnesty and eventually became citizen. 
 
00:07:55 
Also worked at McDonald’s, even became manager, making $3.35/hour. 
 
00:09:00 
Did other jobs for car wash owner, including delivering expensive cars to 
rich people. 
 
00:09:45 
McDonald’s store manager recruited him as manager, saying, “You’ve 
got a good personality”.  Worked on language and math skills. 
 
00:10:45 
Delivered LA Times in Bel Air, met celebrities, tips large and small 
2 
 
 
00:11:30 
Worked at market, stocking shelves and as “basket boy” 
 
00:12:30 
Decided to quit other jobs and focus on McDonald’s. Important to give 
two weeks notice. 
 
00:13:15 
Became swing shift supervisor at McDonald’s, working nights 
 
00:14:20 
At request of management, transferred to problem store (“in red zone”) 
located in predominantly black neighborhood (Hawthorne).  Became 2d 
Assistant Store Manager.  Working toward promotion to 1st Assistant and 
eventually Store Manager. 
 
00:16:30 
Witnessed discrimination at work.  Not everyone was held to same 
appearance standards.  
 
00:19:00 
Through experience realized that using the word “discrimination” made 
people feel uncomfortable.  Better to say, “It’s not fair,” or “he doesn’t like 
me.” 
 
00:20:00 
His supervisor asked him to do development, training other assistant 
managers.  Newer managers, including some he had changed were 
promoted faster than him.  When he discussed issue with boss she gave 
excuses.  Told her he didn’t want to do development work anymore. 
 
00:21:50 
Working lots of hours.  Hard to get a day off.  Supposed to work 25 to 28 
days on and 3 days off.  Actually working 30-35 days straight.  Decided 
to quit. 
 
00:22:30 
Originally came to LA with mother, lived with father, arrived 1977 or 
1978. 
 
00:23:40 
Quit McDonald’s in December 1990 in middle of shift, threw his tie in the 
garbage, said good bye to friends. 
 
00:25:00 
After he quit went to Mexico, was drinking in a bar with his brothers and 
ran into the brother of a friend who told him about work in Alaska. 
 
00:26:50 
Called and applied for job  
 
00:27:50 
Job was on island called Unalaska, between Alaska and Siberia.  
Processed Pollack and King Crab.  “Good experience”.  Free housing 
and free food.  Weather was “fine” except for rain storms.  Island had 
been destroyed by tsunami earlier.  Alarm siren went off several times.  
Told to run for higher ground, but after the first one he just went to the 
3 
 
break room and found some food.  Job was supposed to last six months, 
but ended sooner. 
 
00:32:00 
Girlfriend (Yolanda) from California was living in Iowa.  She had been laid 
off from her job.  Recruited by IBP to come to Iowa.  Paid $1,000 bonus 
and moving expenses. 
 
00:32:50 
He moved to Iowa after Alaska.  Also went to work at IBP.  Experienced 
discrimination in Iowa.  When he applied for unemployment benefits was 
told by “receptionist” that he would have to return to Alaska or California 
to apply.  He knew that was wrong, and returned several times.  She kept 
telling him the same thing.  Finally, he was disruptive (talked in Pee Wee 
Herman voice) and got to talk to supervisor, who approved him 
immediately and paid him 5 or 6 weeks of benefits on the spot. 
 
00:38:00  
That experience helped to teach him the importance of being an 
advocate.  Friend was fired from IBP after he missed work because he 
was stranded in Chicago.  Gilberto explained unemployment process and 
helped him obtain benefits.  Won the case and got $3,000 in back pay. 
 
00:41:50 
Worked at IBP from 1991 to 2005.  In his experience, IBP often took 
advantage of Hispanic workers.  Pushed too hard. 
 
00:42:50 
Gilberto liked to work different jobs, often volunteered to fill in for absent 
employees.  Supervisor thought that he could assign Gilberto at will, 
even though he had a regular assignment. 
 
00:44:30 
Management tried to recruit him to be supervisor or quality control, but 
not interested. Making $42,000 a year with overtime.  Supervisor job paid 
$28,000 with worse hours.  Some opportunity for regular pay increases.  
Said no. 
 
00:46:25 
Yolanda was working on cut floor in “hot side” of plant.  Smells were bad. 
 
00:47:00 
In 1991 came to Iowa City (University Hospital) because they were trying 
to have a baby.  Very few Hispanic people.  Only about 50 Hispanic 
families in Columbus Junction, where the IBP plant was located.  Not 
many Hispanics in Muscatine either.  Moved to Wapello when son, Sixto, 
started school.  He was only the second Hispanic student. 
 
00:49:00  
Enrolled Sixto in Tae Kwando class so he would be able to defend 
himself. Also wanted make sure he could swim.  Also tried boxing. 
 
00:50:00 
Fighting was common problem.  Taught Sixto to say, “Don’t touch me,” 
after two touches, it’s OK to fight back. 
 
4 
 
00:52:00  
Bought mobile home in Wapello. Very few Hispanic people there.  
 
00:54:00  
On weekends Gilberto and Yolanda liked to go to Rock Island to to 
Mexican night club be around other Hispanic people or Muscatine to eat 
Chinese food.  On Sundays they went to Catholic Church together.   
 
00:55:20 
Yolanda seemed reluctant to go to church with him. After questioning 
admitted that she’d been going to a different church for about six months.  
“Light of the World”, an awful religion according to Gilberto.  Her new 
religion led to all kinds of problems and ultimately resulted in divorce.  
Gilberto tried to compromise and learn about her religion, but she 
became a fanatic and refused to go Catholic church any longer because 
she couldn’t tolerate all the “images.” 
 
00:59:00 
Yolanda attended “Light of the World” services in Chicago.  Men and 
women were separate.  Sixto (who was about 7) reported that when he 
tried to get up to use the restroom one of the men grabbed him and 
forced him to sit down.  Gilberto later confronted the man and warned 
him not to touch Sixto.  He also told Yolanda that she had to defend her 
child. 
 
01:00:00 
Yolanda told Gilberto that she wanted a divorce.  The couple had gotten 
married while they were living in Wapello.  She also said that she was 
planning to move to Ottumwa but would continue to work at IBP.   
 
01:01:00 
Gilberto hired a lawyer who helped them reach a common agreement 
about child support, visitation, etc.  Sixto went to live with Yolanda. 
 
01:03:00 
Gilberto offered to join Yolanda’s church in an attempt to preserve the 
marriage, but it didn’t work.  Was unwilling to pay tithe to church.  
Yolanda was making “good money,” but paying 10% of it to the “temple” 
which seemed excessive to Gilberto.  Gilberto noted that the priest was 
wearing an expensive suit and a Rolex. 
 
01:08:35 
Gilberto consented to the divorce but instead that he always be allowed 
to see Sixto. 
 
01:09:30 
Gilberto tried to be actively involved in Sixto’s school activities, worried 
that he would not speak Spanish properly.  Observed other children 
speaking “broken Spanish”.  Did not want people to think that Sixto’s 
parents were illiterate. 
 
01:13:00 
Talked with Sixto about plans after high school.  Sixto wanted to be a 
lawyer, but grades were not good enough to get into Harvard.  Sixto 
graduate from high school in 2004, enlisted in Army, trained in helicopter 
electronics.

01:20:00 
While Sixto was in the Army, Gilberto and Yolanda visited him in Virginia 
on a regular basis.  The couple reunited at that time and had another 
child. 
 
01:21:00 
The couple’s second child, Chamayo, was premature and born with 
serious health problems.  He was hospitalized for an extended period of 
time after he was born.  
  
01:29:00 
The period of hospitalization was difficult for the family.  Yolanda spoke 
little English and Gilberto had to translate for her.  At first, Gilberto 
couldn’t tell who was the responsible doctor.  They also experienced 
discrimination from some hospital staff.  On one occasion the police were 
called. 
 
01:33:00  
Gilberto used experiences like this to advise other people how to stand 
up for themselves.  He noted that many people, Hispanics, blacks and 
poorly educated whites, are afraid to be assertive and are taken 
advantage of.  There is a lot of discrimination in Iowa, even though it’s 
illegal. 
 
01:35:00 
While Chamayo was in the hospital Gilberto stayed at the Ronald 
McDonald House.  The staff wanted to charge him $800/week, but he 
protested saying that he wasn’t as rich as the other people who were 
there, pointing out their expensive cars.  The director intervened and let 
him stay for free. 
 
01:38:00 
He was also treated disrespectfully by staff at Chamayo’s physical 
therapy appointment. 
 
01:44:00 
Gilberto stood up for others too.  Called in sick at IBP, travelled to 
Omaha to help friend with immigration problem. Helped many others with 
unemployment claims. 
 
01:46:00 
Advised a co-worker who was being denied restroom breaks just to pee 
in his pants to see what happens then.  USDA inspector shut down the 
line. 
 
01:47:00 
Different standards applied at IBP depending on race and nationality. 
 
01:49:00 
Told the supervise that, “you don’t provoke someone unless you are sure 
you are 100% right.” 
 
01:50:00 
Began recording conversations with Chamayo’s doctors because he 
believed that he was less likely to be believed in the event of a dispute 
6 
 
about what had been said.  Friend told him about construction job in Iowa 
City, close to Chamayo’s hospital. 
 
01:52:00 
Noticed that the white construction workers liked to smoke a lot, drink 
coffee and listen to music and made the Mexican workers do all the work. 
 
01:53:00 
Dealt with hostile supervisors.  His philosophy is to be a mirror.  “I’ll treat 
you like you treat me.” 
 
01:57:00 
Gilberto’s sense of justice developed after he took a psychology class 
that made him think about fairness, verbal personal attacks.  Also 
influenced by training and experiences at Mcdonald’s. 
 
01:59:30 
Black customer became angry and abuse when Hispanic worked could 
not understand his order.  He wanted a “malt” but on the McDonald’s 
menu it’s called a shake.  The customer thought the server should have 
known what he meant. 
 
02:02:00 
Meatpacking work was very difficult for Hispanic people.  Gilberto 
estimated that IBP hired 400 workers per week at Columbus Junction, 
but only a few of them lasted through the first week.  They weren’t used 
to hostile supervisors or the relentless pace of the conveyor. 
 
02:03:00 
The work was also hard for other immigrants, including Vietnamese.  No 
one understands at first how important it is to keep you knife sharp. 
 
02:04:00 
There were many injuries, tendonitis, accidents, fatigue, difficulties 
working in extremes of temperature  
 
02:05:00 
At IBP Gilberto observed that management rotated the workers between 
jobs to avoid the impact of repetitive motion, but immigrant workers were 
less likely to be rotated.  Some of the Vietnamese workers were too small 
to handle the physically demanding jobs to which they were assigned. 
 
02:11:00 
Gilberto spoke with Hispanic workers from West Liberty Foods (a turkey 
processing plan) who told him that discrimination was common there 
also. 
 
02:13:00 
In 2009, Gilberto lost his home and moved to Forest View (a mobile 
home park in Iowa City).  He split up with Yolanda again. 
 
02:14:00  
Gilberto was pleased to discover services and support available for 
handicapped son, but frustrated that not everyone knew how to obtain 
them.

Part 2 of 2 
00:03:15 
Gilberto was affected by Sixto’s deployment to Afghanistan. 
 
00:04:50  
Parents should be a safety net for their children. 
 
00:06:45 
After deployment, Sixto moved in with Gilberto.  Discussion of events of 
Sixto’s childhood, being a “punk.” 
 
00:11:00 
Loves to cook, especially Mexican and Chinese.  Never eat Mexican food 
in restaurants.  Not really Mexican and too expensive. 
 
00:18:00 
Sixto nearly involved in drive-by shooting in Ottumwa 
 
00:21:45 
Yolanda and two sons now in San Diego, Gilberto depressed by this.  
Sixto doing well working at very fancy restaurant. 
 
00:22:30  
Laid off from construction work along with lots of others, because of 
recession.  Worked on (University) Recreation Center, Vetro Hotel, 
Coralville Library. 
 
00:24:00 
Injured in accident while pouring concrete in parking ramp project.  
Foreman was installing rebar every 18 inches (which is what blueprints 
specified) but should have been every 4 inches.  Floor collapsed while 
concrete being poured.  
 
00:26:30 
Choice of words is important.  Better to say, “initiate legal action,” instead 
of “sue you”.  “Whatever” means “yes.” 
 
00:33:00 
It’s important to stand up to bullies.  Surveilance cameras sometimes are 
a good thing.  Description of bar fight in Iowa City.  Police involved.  
Learned that you can’t fight back until you’ve been hit twice.  Told other 
people about this rule. 
 
00:40:00 
Recently found out he was diabetic.  Had already stopped drinking.  Was 
a “social drinker”.  Drank when he went out.  Usual limit three beers. 
 
00:42:00 
Still bothered by discrimination.  Checker at Walmart let white person cut 
in line ahead of him.  Server at Olive Garden treated Gilberto and his 
sister, brother-in-law disrespectfully.  Has developed responses to this 
kind of treatment. 
 
00:50:30 
Studied to be school bus driver.  Was very stressful, aggravated 
diabetes. 
 
 
00:52:30 
Had to pass medical exam to get job.

00:53:00 
Chamayo injured due to inattention while being transported on school  
bus.  Very distressing.  Also had bruises which school principal claimed 
were self-inflicted. 
 
01:00:00 
Making $12/hour, 20 hours/week as school bus driver.  So much stress, 
working like a zombie. 
 
01:01:00 
Injured in accident.  Woman ran through stop sign and ran into bus.  
Gilberto did not see her coming, caught off guard.  X-ray and CAT scan 
showed nothing broken but can’t walk, in pain, weak as a baby.  Off work 
for 5 days, then physical therapy.  School sent him to same doctor that 
had treated him for other on-the-job injuries. 
 
01:05:00 
Went to Mexico and got an MRI.  They are much cheaper there.  
Mexican doctor identified nature of injury.  3-4 herniated disks in lower 
back. 
   
1:06:00 
Doctors have lots of power.  They can say what’s right and wrong.  Have 
the power to make you obey.  Despite serious pain and disability, given 
only a 5% disability rating.  Person that hit him was an important person 
in the courthouse. 
 
1:10:00 
Another driver with a much less serious injury received more 
compensation than Gilberto.
