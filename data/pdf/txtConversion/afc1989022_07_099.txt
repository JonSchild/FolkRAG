-11 Louis Gibellini, Eureka, Nevada 
November 4, 1898 
Fieldworkers: Andrea Graham and Blanton Owen 
Talk about modern gadgets, computers, etc. 
Louis was born M&v.__14,-19 Q7 at Prospect Mine, about five 
miles south of Eureka. There was a small town there, gone now 
since the mines closed down. He lived there until he was 14, then 
moved to Eureka. He mined for a living, still owns a mining 
property under option; supposed to be one of the largest vanadium 
deposits in the world, but there are "metallurgical problems" 
with treating the ore cheaply. He located it in 1942, it has 
always been under option by various companies; a Canadian company 
has it now. If they can work out the metallurgy, they will put in 
a plant to process the'ore. He says a Swiss bank said there is 
plenty of money available if they figure out the metallurgy. He 
says "it looks pretty promising." 
Hi.s  parents came to this coil nl-r?••hey• wertm both-about 
7 
14  yeah old, over 100 years aqo. They came from Switzerland, 
Canton de Chino •7). 
[This might be Campodolcino, Italy on the 
Swiss border -- cat.] His father ran a string of pack mules for 
hauj•g- ore out of the mountains, and later became a miner= They 
had relatives in Nevada and came directly here. His father was 
not involved in the Charcoal Burners War, because he was not a 
carbonari. His granddaughter has an old book of Nevada history, 
including the charcoal burners war.

When Louis started in the mines, they were still drilling by 
hand, in small mines. Eureka was the leading lead mine in the 
world. He  drilled by hand, at any angle_ 'You  didn't know any 
better 
-
,-so you eajo ed it." Machines came in about 40 or 50 years 
ago, maybe earlier, depending on how affordable they were. 
Chinese used to lease mines in the area, the street above the 
main street in Eureka on the west was all-Chinese. In the 
downstairs of the old Eureka Hotel there are arched cellars and 
tunnels that are allegedly old opium dens, fancy brickwork.

Englishmen 
Ital-Lanz, ChiIlese, some Irish lived in Eureka. 
al 
The  Chinese  l lef-t, many Italians stayed, but there are very 
few old-timers left in town. Outsiders are—predominant now, 
brought in by gold mines in the northern _part of the comity. 
When he was mining they were after qold, silver and lead. 
The narrow gauge railroad came in from Palisade to the north, and 
ran up to the mines where ore was loaded and shipped to Utah to 
be smelted. Eureka sme-ltprs were gone by the time Louis was born; 
there used to be seven smelters-, two large ones., 
How he qot into _drill_i_n_g competitions: in the old days, 
there were drilling cow 
n, you used to  have to drill 
ld_ 
15 minutes (it is now 10  minutes). "It was 3ust th e o 
fashioned 
way, you know, and I never  
got rid of it, I co ntinued the old 
way:'*— It was mostly  
work' ncl miners w1w—competed. They also had 
double jack contests, where one man turns the steel and the other 
uses the hammer. Louis double-jacked in the mines, but he never 
competed in the contests. In double-jacking, the men switch 
places; in contests they can switch without missing a blow. The 
Tonopah drilling contest still has double jacking. 
He used to drill by hand eight hours a day. The rock in the 
mines varies in hardness, the steels have to be tempered 
differently for different rock. If tempered wrong, the steels 
could "just break like glass." Ever-,y--kind of rock--took _a 
different _temper, steels were sharpened ev ery da y. He tempers by 
heating a cherry red, then cool ott, thin—
take a torch to heat 
the bit a little, then "draw the temper". For granite he draws it 
"a light straw", more bluish for a softer temper. His father 
taught him how to sharpen and temper steels, dip it in water when 
it is the right color. 
He would take-  
several sets of steels into the mine each day, 
to be ready forwhai-Pver 
rnrk he found. He would drill awhile in 
a down hole with water running from a bucket, drill until it made 
a muck, then clean the hole out with a scraper, put in more water 
and drill until it muddied again and clean it out again. Drilling 
straight up or at an angle was all dry. You had to be able to 
drill at all angles. He thinks most of the kids in the drilling 
contests don't know anything about underground mining. 
" z t 's a 
lost art."

In 1959 he won a drilling 
 contest in Virginia City, and won 
a_be 
uc 
e th t was awarded by the President (actually it was 
then vice-president Nixon, and the 
o_easion was the 
 
of 
the discovery of the CoM;:tforrk r 
o d e). Louis got first, his brother 
got second in the contest. Louis doesn't train, and says he 
"doesn't exert himself", but he still beats a lot of the younger 
guys in the contests. He says he has already done it, so he 
doesn't have to prove himself. He held the championship for 
IAW-BO-A001 - 
3 
years. 
Rock buildings in Eureka. There was a quarry near the new 
high school, all quarried by hand. His bar was built of stone 
quarried by hand. He thinks there were Italian stonemasons. He 
can't recall any well-known builders in town when he was growing 
up, except one Ital i 
an_who-bu t- 
the-wa-ll-below --the _-o..ld school 
during_the_WPA` he had a wooden leg. Louis remodeled the old 
building the bar is in, laid all the wood floors downstairs. He 
opened the bar in 1947, ignored it after his wife died and just 
opened on special occasions. Now he hires a bartender to run it, 
he is just the swamper, he doesn't like to be behind the bar. He 
gets a good income from his mine property, and gets a write off 
on the bar if he keeps it open. He has live music on Saturday. 
Most of the mines were fairly close to town, Ruby Hill was 
the biggest and it is about 2 1/2 miles out of town. Currently 
they are leaching old dumps with cyanide, but not mining. The hot 
water underground forced them to quit mining, the shaft was sunk 
2,450 feet down, and they encountered water and could not pump it 
out fast enough. Closest active mine is the Windfall, south of 
Prospect. He worked underground there for 14 years, but now it is 
open pit, only a little work. No underground mining any more. 
SIDE 2 
Could not open pit mine at Ruby Hill, too deep. Large mine 
up north near Cortez, Atlas Minerals mining in the Roberts Creek 
Mountains, an open pit mine at Tonkin, several mines to the east. 
Most mines are pretty"far out of Eureka. He mined at the 
Windfall, went back and forth on skis one winter. Everything in 
mining is mechanized now, but used to be all by hand. The Diamond 
Mine, at Prospect, had large caves. No active mining there now, 
but he thinks they are doing some core drilling. He also worked 
in the mines near Ely. 
He is in good health, he feels fine, he says they do a 
physical and the only thing they find wrong is "a weak brain." 
All the miners he used to work with are gone. Asking about other 
Italians in town: Al Biale, used to run the hardware store, has 
some good stories, live 
in 
' trt 
om the slag 
dump at the north end of town.. 
Italians did not have any particular reputation in town. 
Eureka used to have "a crime a day." His parents used to make 
wine--and-bran;-about 200 gallons of wine a year. They grew and 
prepared most of their own food, They used to have heavy 
sno 
ww ss tuzms in 
Porspect, had to stock up enough food for the 
winter. Italians made sausage, hams, bacon 
had milk cows. In the 
summer his family moved to 
e in 
a 
from Prospect, where they 
had a_b-i­g 
,„rden, raised food and put it up for the winter. Food 
kept in cellars, or buried in the snow. Made cheese and butter, 
IAW-BO-A001 -

made most of their food. Now nobody knows how to do it anymore. 
His_parPnt-s__spnkP  
=talian,_-but_Louis-.says he always answered 
them--in English, he only spoke a little Italian although he 
understood it. His parents also spoke pretty good English, but 
spoke Italian between themselves. He does not know of any Italian 
social clubs, but he thinks there were. He remembers an Italian 
who played an accordion for dances, and several others. No one 
there who still plays. 
Al Biale's f-ather ran the store in town, lived-to be -ID-Q. Al 
changed the store to hardware. Al's father used to ship carloads 
of 
sugar in for the bootleggers. During prohibition there was 
quite a lot of illegal whiskey making. Stills were usually 
outside, out in the hills wherever there was a spring. They 
produced a lot of whiskey. One still about 10 or 15 miles out of 
town was "enormous," produced all the whiskey for Ely and other 
towns. He does not know who ran it, says it might have been an 
Italian family. Al Biale might know more about it. Grapes for 
making wine were shipped in from California. His folks bought  a 
ton 
a 
a time r make_ 
-0.0 
0r--  300 gallons at a time, and brandy. 
Shipped 
in on the narrow-gauge railroad from Palisade, which 
operated from the 1930s. 
Talking about his granddaughter, her education. He says in 
the old days, you just worked. 
Many Italians farmed; he says wherever there was a little 
water they would plant a gardaD, and they ra is e
d 
 big families. 
Many went into-the-ranehing  huSiRess• Where they used to ranch 
there is nothing left now. They raised big families and never 
went in debt. At Prospect the water was 1000 feet from anything, 
they carried it 'to wa:teY 
q•ardens; Now there is all kinds of 
warmer,  and no one gardens any more. His wife used to have a nice 
flower and vegetabre garden— behind the house/bar. 
His wife's maiden name was Florio, her father was a big 
sheep and cattle man -- Angelo (A.C.) Florio. His wife's name was 
Josephine. He was almost a millionaire when he died, but Louis 
says lawyers got most of it, and his ex-wife. "Well, where 
there's money, there's always trouble." Problems with his own 
estate -- "The biggest enemies in the world were my relatives."' 
"I try to be honest, and I'm still here." Problems with his 
mother's estate.

Continuation of discussion of Louis' mother's estate, other 
relatives taking property she wanted to leave to him. 
"There is something in this world that protects you, I 
think. Because, God, the accidents that I had and never get a 
scratch is unimaginable." Louis has never had a bad injury, 
despite falls and accidents in the mines and the mountains. When 
he has a physical, the doctor says he is in the condition of a 
fifty-year-old. "I went through all the tests in the world, and 
they says, My God, you're something for the books. They can't 
believe it, you know, that at my age, that I go along and do 
things that I still do. I can get on a dance floor and do 
anything that those young people do. Like I say, drilling, I 
could make a good show if I wanted to, but I says, why do it, I 
done it, my share, so I'll make an appearance. They want me 
there, and like I say, I'll prove to 'em that I won't fall over, 
I'll go all the way, you know. When I get through I'm in better 
shape than anybody down there. I'm not puffin', I'm not 
sweatin'."

Talking about how deep he drilled in Carson City at the Oct. 
31 drilling contest. He says he used eight pieces of steel, so "I 
must have drilled pretty good." Louis showing his steels. A_guy

drills are 3/4 inch across minimum, they are checked at the 
contest. The shaft has to be 3/4 inch, but they generally measure 
at the tip. The drills get narrower as they get longer, so they 
will fit in the hole.

Drilling in the mines, the formation of the rock would 
determine how deep the holes would have to be drilled before 
blasting. In some rock, six inches a day was good progress 
(quartzite); softer rock you could go two or three feet. In the 
contest, you are allowed to have eleven drills. He says he thinks 
he had the heaviest hammer at the contest. The standard is four 
pounds, the women use three pound hammers. Louis' hammer, 
including the handle, weighs over 4 1/2 pounds. "When I got 
through, I didn't know I even drilled. I never exerted myself, I 
felt just like when I started. And the rest, they way they exert 
themselves, they're crazy." Some of the drillers had a different 
kind of hammer which he calls a "contest hammer." They are small 
in the center and have a big face, longer and thinner. 
His 
hammer is just like they used in the mines. He grips it about 
halfway down the handle, although he says you get more power 
holding it further back. 
Starting the hole is called "collaring," need to start the 
hole straight and round. He says he had a three-cornered hole in 
this year's contest. The other contestants had drills with three 
or four cutting edges, kind of round, which he says makes 
starting a round hole easier. "When you get a three-cornered 
hole, you're dead. You know, it don't cut, see. No matter how 
hard you hit, it just don't cut." He usually does better, but 
this time he got a three-cornered hole, and in a contest there 
isn't time to stop and fix it. 
We went outside so Louis could show us how he drills in his 
practice rock. (Sound"of drilling, hitting steels with hammer). 
Blanton tries drilling. Drill can be turned either way, if it 
sticks, you can turn it the opposite way. Drill is turned after 
each blow. 
(A guy comes up asking if the bar is open)
