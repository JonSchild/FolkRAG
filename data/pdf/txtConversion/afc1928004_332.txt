THE DARN/DEST OF SCAMPS. 
An sung in the burlesque of " Rosemi Shell," to the air of " The Scamp." 
Copyrighted in 1876 by SYDNEY ROSENFELD. 
I 
PLATTER myself I'm a 
scamp, 
A double-dyed villain, egad! 
A 
scally-wag, rascal, and rogue, 
And everything else that is bad; 
I 
proved to my parents 
bane, 
A 
perfect young fiend to my nurse, 
And every year that I 
spend on this sphere, 
I 
am getting from bad to worse. 
CHORD'S. 
If ever there was an old scamp, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am he; 
From William the Norman to Brighanrthe Mormon, 
They can't hold a 
candle to me. 
When first I 
began to cavort, 
A 
tiny young shaver of six, 
The first thing I 
did of a 
villainous sort 
Was to smash all our kittens with bricks; 
Just one year from then an old hen 
I 
captured—my age was but seven— 
I 
got a 
sky-rocket hitched on to her socket, 
And sent the old chicken to heaven. 
CHORUS. 
If ever there was an old scamp, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am he; 
From a 
Sunday-school teacher to Henry Ward Beecher, 
They can't hold a 
candle to me. 
a At twelve I 
was boss of the town, 
Ss t Had mashed every kid there was nigh; 
Laid every lad low with a 
fearful knock down, 
And given each one a 
black eye; 
At twenty I 
worked in the banks, 
And was known as a 
deuce of a 
salter; 
One day, as they say, I 
broke loose from the ranks, 
And the papers all call me " defaulter." 
CHORUS. 
If ever there was an old scamp, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am he; 
From a 
tree-loving Mormon to Duncan and Sherman, 
They can't hold a 
candle to me. 
I 
have sworn, I 
have burglared, and stolen, 
I 
have chiselled and blackmailed and lied; 
In fact, I 
don't know of a 
crime every time 
That I 
couldn't commit if I 
tried I 
I 
flatter myself I'm a 
scamp, 
A deuced immense one, egad 
A 
double-dyed villain and rascal and rogue, 
And everything else that is bad. 
CHORUS. 
If ever there was an old scamp, 
I 
flatter myself I 
am he; 
From to the head of the Nixes to the Bow of Big Sixes) 
They can't hold a 
candle to me.

TOMMY, MAICF1 ROOM FOR YOUR AUNTIE. 
AIR.—" Tommy, Make Room for Your Uncle." 
AS 
sung by Miss JENNIE III:GEES. 
Now Miss Fitzwilliam of Union Square 
Presents herself to you, 
And you may guess, when she is dressed, 
Of gents she knows a 
few ; 
A 
widower fell in love with me 
While riding in a 
train ; 
Ile had his little boy with him, 
Who caused us both much pain. 
SPOKEN. — Yes, the confounded young urchin caused me a 
great 
deal of pain and sorrow, and the widower, his father, introduced 
me to the little boy as his auntie, and during the whole of the jour-
ney the father had to say— 
CHORUS. 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
There's a 
little dear; 
Tommy, make room for your auntie, 
I 
want her to sit here • 
You know papa has got 
'a 
cake, 
And that he'll give to you ; 
So don't annoy, there's a 
good boy, 
Make room for your auntie, do. 
When first I 
met this widower, 
'Twas on the journey down 
To spend a 
day at Long Branch, 
Just like a 
swell from town ; 
The widower loved romantic scenes, 
And a 
squeeze on the sly; 
But when his arm went round my waist 
The boy began to cry. 
SPOKEN.—Ire declared his papa was hurting me, and would in-
sist upon sitting between us; only fancy making love to a 
girl 
with a 
little boy in the way; but his father said to him in a 
voice 
so sweet— 
Tommy, make room, etc. 
The flither told his loving son 
To watch the passing train ; 
But no, he said, my dear papa, 
You'll kiss that lady again ; 
Of course I 
blushed a 
maiden blush, 
And he was not himself; 
For who could make love in a 
car, 
In front of that young elf? 
SPOKE,— Yes, it would never do to make love before the boy, 
and when the widower pressed me I 
said " Not before the boy, sir 
—not before the boy "—just then we went under a 
tunnel, and— 
Tommy, make room, etc.

FIELD.

On, Lemuel, my lark, 
Oh, Lemuel, my beau;

Dey'll cover all de floor. 
Oh, Lem! Lem! Lem! Lemuel, I 
say, 
Go down to de cotton field and bring de boys away. 
CHORUS. 
Go down to de cotton field,

We'll work no more to- day. 
Oh, Lemuel, my hope, 
Oh, Lemuel My joy! 
I'll tell you who'll be at de ball, 
My woolly-headed boy; 
Dere's Nelly Bly, you know, 
And Juliana Snow; 
Dere's Cane- brake Kitty likes de boys, 
And she'll be sure to go. 
Oh, Lem 
Lent! Lem ! Lemuel, I 
say. 
Go down to de cotton field and bring de boys away. 
Go down, etc. 
Oh, Lemuel is tall, 
Oh, Lemuel is fair ; 
Oh, Lemuel has gone to- day 
To take de morning air; 
He makes de fiddle hum, 
lie makes de banjo turn, 
He rattles on de old jaw-bone, 
And beats upon de drum. 
Oh, Lem ! Lent! Lem ! Lemuel, I 
say, 
Go down to de cotton field and bring de boys away. 
Go down, etc.

POOR OLD UNCT.P* BEN. 
Words and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY. 
The Music of this song is published by E. H. Henorso, 229 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
Copyright, 186, by E. H. EARRING. 
OLD Uncle Ben is gone away, 
He heard the angels call ; 
De banjo what he used to play 
Now hangs upon de wall; 
De happy songs he used to sing 
We'll never hear again, 
Except when dreaming in de night 
Of poor old Uncle Ben. 
CHORUS. 
Poor old Uncle Ben 
Is now among the blest; 
He used to take us on his knee, 
And sing us all to rest; 
But now we are alone, 
We'll never see again 
Around de little cabin door 
Our dear old Uncle Ben. 
He used to roam de cotton fields, 
And help to mow de hay, 
And down de river glide along 
Wid heart so light and gay; 
De old plantation was his home, 
Among de fields of corn; 
'Twos in de old Kentucky State 
Where Uncle Ben was born. 
Poor old Uncle Ben, etc. 
Dere was no darkey round de place 
Dat mosso loved so well; 
He used to sit beside him, 
While his stories he would tell ; 
De children danc'd around his feet, 
And all was gladness then ; 
But now they plant sweet roses on 
The grave of Uncle Ben. 
Poor old Uncle Ben, etc. 
WORKING AHEAD. 
SONG AND DANCE. 
Words by SAMUEL N. 
MITCHELL. 
Music by J. TANNENBAUM. 
The Music of this song is published by BALMER & WEBER, St. Louis, 31o. 
Price 40 cents. 
W HEN I 
was " broke and busted," and pinched for meat and 
bread, 
I 
joined a 
little party to " work them up ahead;" 
That is, I 
was the agent, and the agent's business is 
To " fix things" true and trusty for a 
good and healthy " biz ;" 
I " wrestled programmes" in the town, and helped to stick the 
bills, 
I " button-holed the locals," and I 
advertised the mills; 
I 
got long " puffs " of eighty lines in papers that were read, 
I 
tell you it's a 
bully job to work the show ahead. 
CHORUS. 
Working ahead, working ahead; / tell you it's a 
bully job, 
When you are pinched for bread, 
To let yourself as agent and work the show ahead. 
I 
figured close on contracts for baggage, board and halls, 
And on the correspondents I 
made short arid friendly calls; 
I 
gave my " comps " to railroad men including engineer, 
And didn't change a 
date unless the town was " very queer," 
I 
travelled some en beauty, and a 
lot of pretty girls 
I 
often " mashed " completely with my glossy raven curls, 
They all would make me dine with them, for I 
was easy led, 
Oh, it, is just a 
bully job to work the show ahead. 
Working ahead, etc. 
I 
always wore a 
diamond pin when out upon the road, 
And when I 
could get trusted I 
would dress up a 
la mode; 
I 
used to think it gave the show a 
cultivated tone 
To have the agent looking nice, if clothes were not his own; 
Oh I 
was just the " boss " of all the boys within the land, 
And if a 
brother " struck a 
snag" I 
lent a 
helping hand; 
I 
was a 
very useful man the managers all said, 
And every body liked me when I 
worked the show ahead. 
Working ahead, etc.

WE PUT ON LOTS OF STYLE. 
Words by J. F. SHERIDAN. 
GOOD evening, kind friends—how are youl 
We're glad to see you all; 
Having a 
little time to spare 
We thought we'd make a 
call; 
For it always gives us pleasure 
To sin fi- 
and dance for you, 
With your smiling faces round— 
'Tis what we like to do. 
CHORUS. 
For you look so sweet, 
And dressed so neat; 
When we go out to take a 
walk, 
The gals all at us smile; 
The little dears can't help it for 
We put on lots of style. 
• 
There was a 
dance the other night; 
Of course now we were there; 
We put on all our nice clothes, 
And oiled and curled our hair; 
When the fiddle commenced to play, 
Then we began to dance; 
The ni ,rs they all went crazy, 
And the gals into a 
trance. 
Oh, we did it so neat, 
And looked so sweet, 
When we'd ask the gals to dance, 
They'd look at us and smile; 
We set the poor gals crazy, 
For we put on lots of style. 
Now, white folks, we must leave you, 
For we've other work to do ; 
Some other time we'll come again, 
And sing and dance for you; 
Were aoing to another ball to- night; 
Now wouldn't you like to come '1 
We must fix up a 
little bit, 
So homeward we must run_ 
9 
WE PUT ON LOTS OF STYLE —Continued. 
CHORUS. 
Oh, we'll look so sweet, 
And be dressed so neat; 
When we get there the gals will stare, 
And of course commence to smile; 
We'll set the poor gals crazy, 
If we put on all our style. 
THE DANCING APOLLO. 
HERE I 
am with blubber lips, 
Feet just like a 
pair of ships, 
Nose as fiat as ever built, 
Eyes like holes burnt in a 
quilt, 
Mouth that spreads from ear to ear, 
Monkey shines and actions queer, 
Dancing like a 
crazy one, 
To fill you with delight. 
CHORUS. 
Kick up shins, 
Full of grins, 
These the pins 
That always wins, 
Coming like an avalanche to greet you every night. 
Nigger is the great man now— 
That white folks must allow ; 
Everybody clears the track, 
When they see a 
man that's black— 
Woolly head it is a 
sign 
That the owner's bound to shine; 
If you say he isn't, 
There's sure to be a 
fight. 
Kick up shins, etc

Words by HARRY PEARSON. 
Music by ALBERT ASCHER. 
LIFE'S journey's a 
path full of briers and thorns, 
We must trudge it on foot, boys together; 
The rough and the smooth, The calm and the storm, 
We must face it no matter the weather; 
It is folly to grieve for the joys that are past, 
Our troubles a 
lesson will give; 
So courage, my lads, with strong hearts and true, 
We will sing, " while we live, let us live." 
CHORUS. 
The adage tho' old is a 
good one to give, 
" 
In this world while we live, let us live, let us live," 
" 
In this world while we live, let us live." 
The miser a 
crusty old knave with his pelf, 
The rich in their carriage and four, 
Are not half as happy as you are, my friends, 
If you've got health and strength though you're poor. 
Then to grumble ' gaiiast fate, is a 
sin and a 
shame, 
But thank God for blessings He'll give ; 
Throw care to the winds, be staunch to the core, 
And then sing, " While we live, let us live." 
The adage, ete. 
There are those in the world that are poorer than us, 
Struggling hard with it's turmoils and strife ; 
Then hold out your hand, and help them to mount 
A round in the ladder of life. 
The mite though but small, will reap its reward, 
If you've enemies freely forgive ; 
With envy to no man, and good will to all, 
Yon can sing, " While we live, let us live." 
The adage, etc.

A SKETCH FOR TWO CHARACTERS—DRESSED ems-
E. 
[Scene, a 
street. 
Enter AUGUSTUS, who looks around as if 
expecting some one. 
He is dressed as a 
fop.] 
AUGUSTUS.— I 
wonder where she can he ? 
She made an ap-
pointment to meet me here precisely at eight. 
It's past that 
now. I 
wonder if she will disappoint me? No; I 
don't he. 
lieve she will, for I 
flatter myself I 
have won that palpitating 
little heart of hers. 
Oh, she's a 
beauty I Nobody else stands 
a show to win her from me. 
Why, she wouldn't look at 
another chap. 
I'm her only beau. 
Where can she be ? 
Girls 
are always late. 
Hello I 
I 
wonder who this is? He ooks 
enough like me to be my twin. 
[Enter ADOLPHUS.] 
ADOLPHUS.— She said she'd be here at eight. I 
hope she's 
not going to disappoint. 
I 
never knew her to break her 
promise. 
Oh, she's just the sweetest little angel out of para-
dise! 
Such eyes! 
Such hair I And then she loves me so. 
She calls me pet and sugar-plum, and all sweet cognomens 
like these. 
Then the best of it is she won't even look at any 
other fellow. [
Sees AuGusTus.] 
Hello! [
Aside.] I 
wonder 
what he's dodging around here for. 
Why, he's got into my 
clothes. 
I'll accost his royal highness. 
How do you do, 
stranger ? 
AUG UST US. — I'm lively, thank you. 
What's the news? 
ADOLPHUS. — Oh, nothing. 
You didn't happen to see a

what kind of a

She was to meet me

My coal-black love, she's lively as a 
cricket, 
She can dance, she can sbout; 
And you ought to see dat old mule prance, 
When I 
drive my Chloe out. 
She can wash, she can bake, she can hoe de corn, 
She can pick de cotton, it am true ; 
She can rock de cradle, and sing de song, 
And make de hoecake too. 
Cho. We'll dance, &c. 
Now, white' folks all, take my advice, 
And remember what I 
say, 
Get married all, as I 
have done, 
For I 
feel so good to-day; 
With my Chloe sitting by my side 
I'm happy as a 
king, I 
know; 
I'll tap de tambo, we'll sing de chorus, 
And bid you all adieu. 
Cho. We'll dance, &c.

" WHERE THE WATER LILIES GROW." 
Music by ARTHUR PERCY. 
Published by Wm. A. POND & 
Cu, 517 Broadway, New York. 
'TWAS in the pleisant summer time. I 
met him all by chance. 
The robins sang their sweetest rhyme, and loving was his 
glance; 
We wander'd Enid the blooming flow'rs, he called me sweet and 
fair, 
The queen of all the sunny bow'rs, the brightest rose-bud 
there. 
SPOKEN.—Oh, he was charming—such a 
delightful little fel-
low! I 
never can forget— 
CHORUS. 
When we met there by the river, 
In the sunlight's merry glow; 
For my heart he won forever, 
Where the pretty little water lilies grow. 
I 
dream of him where'er I 
go, I 
never can forget 
Those eyes that shone with sparkling glow, the day when first 
we met ; 
The lilies all will fade and die, the birds will fly away, 
We can't forget, nor he nor I, the love was told that day. 
SPOKEN.—No I For he begged me just to whisper the little 
" 
Yes." 
When we met, etc.

The cot upon the bill, where friends are living still ; 
That pleasant little love- birth place, the cot upon the hill, 
That pleasant little love-birth place, the cot upon the bill. 
'Twas in that cosey little cot I 
passed my younger days, 
With friends and others always by, to cheer my childish ways ; 
But now that I 
am far away, I 
often wonder still 
If those kind friends would welcome me, to the cot upon the 
hill.

'TWA s 
in a 
Southern grove I 
dwelt, 
No sorrow then I 
knew; 
It seem'd dat eb'ry hour was bright, 
Pat gayly o'er me flew; 
De little ones dat clung around, 
Ere I 
from dem did roam, 
Made eb'ry hour still happier seem, 
Oh! dear " young folks at home." 
CHORUS. 
I'm bery sad—no joy for me, 
Why did I 
eber roam 7 
Oh! shall I 
neber, neber see 
Be dear young folks at home 7 
(apeat.) 
We play'd de banjo, tambourine, 
And danced beneath de shade, 
And all around us loved to hear 
De music dat we made; 
Be mocking- bird sung sweetly then, 
Be wild birds dey would come, 
And make de grove wid music ring, 
Oh dear " young folks at home!" 
I'm bery sad, etc. 
But now I 
broken-hearted go, 
Poor Tom dey all despise; 
I 
grieve o'er all de happy past, 
Wid bitter tears and sighs; 
I'm scorned by all de careless crowd, 
No matter where I 
roam; 
Oh ! shall I 
neber see again 
The dear " young folks at home!" 
I'm bery sad, etc, 
Ah! no, I 
now am far away, 
Where no such pleasures shine, 
I 
neber drearu'd dat sorrow'd come 
To dis poor heart of mine; 
Den take me to dat dear old spot, 
Nor longer let me roam, 
And lay me in de cold, cold grave, 
Near the dear " young folks at home!" 
l'm bery sad, etc. 
WORK WITH A WILL. 
TEAT bye-words of the past are good 
Of course you'll not deny; 
Though most of them have been in song, 
To find one more I'll try ; 
The thought, I 
have it right away-
You see my mind's not still— 
The new bye- word is simply this: 
Work, boys, work with a 
will. 
CHORUS. 
Work, boys, work with a 
will; 
Never despair, never stand still, 
But work, boys, work with a 
will, 
Striving to get up the hill. 
You've often seen the little bee 
Improve each shining hour, 
And noticed too how eagerly 
It skips from flower to flower, 
Distilling honey in its hive, 
Was ne'er known to be still; 
Now there's a 
good example, boys; 
Work, boys, work with a 
will. 
Work, boys, etc. 
Perhaps upon the road of life 
Many a 
man you'll find, 
Who needs encouragement in work, 
Though lazy not inclined; 
Speak to him a 
few cheering words— 
Kindness never does kill; 
Your words will have a 
good effect; 
He'll work, yes, with a 
will. 
Work, boys, etc.

Well, Eliza took a 
notion,-
rHEAVE HO! A SAILOR'S YARN; 
OR; JACK JUNK. 
Every inch a 
Sailor. 
Any one who has been aboard ship, and observed sailors at work turning 
the capstan, removing a 
large sail, or doing any duty which requires a 
pull 
all toge:her, must have remarked how they contrive to lighten their labor 
with a 
song and chorus; one sailor singing the solo, while at the end of 
every line the others all come in with " Yo ! heave ho !" or " Cheerily, 
man ho !" or some other meaningless yet characteristic phrase. 
These 
songs have no sequence, each line being irrelevant to, and independent of, 
the preceding one. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC M ACCABE. 
ALL folks, old and young, who— 
Y'heave ho! 
Choose to come and listen awhile unto me; 
I'm going to make bold to— 
Y'heave ho 
Spin a 
sailor's yarn, all about the deep blue sea. 
CHORUS. 
With a 
y'heave ! with y'heave ho—i—o! 
Our Captain had a 
daughter,— 
Y'heave ho! 
Which her name it was Eliza, with beautiful blue eyes, 
And at school they had taught her— 
Y'heave ! 
For to play on the piano and singing likewise. 
With a, etc. 
The boatswain was my messmate,— 
Y'heave ho! 
And he fell in love with Eliza, and she with him also ; 
To the Captain he confessed it,— 
Y'heave ho! 
But the captain he forbid him in the cabin for to go. 
With a, etc. 
Says Eliza to her father,— 
Y'heave ho! 
" 
Without my dear boatswain I'll never live content." 
Says the Captain, " 
liss, I'd rather— 
Y'heave ho ! 
Throw you overboard to the fishes than ever I'd consent." 
With a, etc. 
Y'heave ho! 
As her father was so cruel, she'd be revenged on him ; 
(1) 
Y'llEAVE HO! A SAILOR'S YARN.—Continued. 
So she jumped into the ocean,— 
Y'heave ho! 
And there she was drowned, because she couldn't swim. 
With a, etc. 
MORAL. 
Now you at love as is raileiS,— 
Y'heave ho! 
Remember this cruel captain, and don't do like him, 
And you girls as like sailors,— 
. 
Y'heave ho! 
Don't you fall in love before you learn to swim. 
With a, etc. 
MACCABE'S LAND OF DREAMS. 
Written and composed by FREDERIC M A 
CCABE. 
IN 
the pleasant summer ev'ning 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows, 
When the day begins to fade. 
In the pleasant summer ev'ning 
I 
lie beneath the shade, 
Watching the shadows 
That dance on the meadows 
When the day begins to fade. 
Then a 
sweet remembrance comes to me, 
Like a 
long- forgotten strain 
Of music awaking, 
And freshly breaking 
Over my heart again. 
In visions of the past 
I 
see my love arise, 
And in my dreaming 
I 
feel the beaming 
Of her soft, compassionate eyes. 
Ah! thus may sadden'd hearts renew 
Their life's pure morning beams, 
On the past to ponder, 
And softly wander 
Into the land of dreams.

The Music of this song is published by E. II. HARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. 
Price JO cents. 
Copyright, 1875, by E. H. HARDING. 
ONE hundred years, one hundred years, 
Since freedom first did dawn 
And many a 
thought comes over me, 
As I 
hail each coming morn; 
So I'll make bold and now,:unfold 
The glories of that day; 
The great things done, and battles won, 
Since freedom gain'd the sway. 
CHORUS. 
One hundred years since the days of Seventy-six, 
One hundred years since we did the foemen fix; 
Then praise with joyful glee the banner of the free, 
And the men of Seventy-six. 
I'll tell you first of Bunker Hill, 
There Warren met the foe, 
Who wished to tax the people, 
That the tea did overthrow; 
He nobly tried and bravely died, 
He well the battle won; 
And Washington the finish gave 
To what he left undone. 
One hundred years, etc. 
Then Jackson with his cotton bales, 
lie made the enemy fly! 
Our banner still triumphant 
The invader did defy; 
And Lawrence fought and the lesson taught 
Not to give up the ship! 
And Winfield Scott at Lundy's Lane, 
Did well the foemen whip. 
One hundred years, etc. 
Our Morse he made the telegraph, 
'Twas laid by Cyrus Field ; 
Ben Franklin chain'd the lightning, 
We the power of steam revealed; 
Peabody gave what he did save, 
And Farragut !laird fast 
The glorious flag we love so well, 
Unto his vessel's mast. 
One hundred years, etc.

And when I

By the evil example I

And spouted at Exeter Hall, 
I 
started loan offices, hospitals, clubs, 
And finally swindled them all.—Cao. 
In the City my name I

And swindling comp'nies promote; 
Yet always creep out with the bulk of the funds, 
Before it's found out it won't float.

THE rich complain at Fortune's frown, 
The poor grow poorer still ; 
The spendthrift saves his pennies now 
To pay his lodging bill; 
The miser counts his secret store, 
His greed he can't restrain; 
He hopes to save a 
trifle more 
When the good times come again. 
CHORUS. 
Then keep your spirits light and gay, 
And sing this hopeful strain, 
We'll all be happy by-and-by, 
When the good times come again. 
The man of toil is now at rest, 
His rent is coming due; 
His purse is empty, but his heart 
Is honest, proud, and true; 
He smiles at each succeeding cross, 
And does not sigh in vain; 
He knows the tide of life will change 
When the good times come again 
Then keep your spirits, etc. 
The child sits on her father's knee, 
Her kiss he can't refuse; 
" 
Just see my little toe, papa, 
I 
want a 
pair of shoes." 
Too well he knows her slightest want. 
But now she asks in vain; 
All he can say is, " Yes, my dear, 
When the good times come again." 
Then keep your spirits, etc. 
The lover looks with wistful eyes 
Upon his bride to be; 
She begs him to be good and wise, 
Till brighter days they see; 
They kiss and part, while in each heart 
Sweet hopes of joy remain; 
Some day they'll wed, but they must wait 
Till the good times come again. 
Then keep your spirits, etc, 
THE VILLAGE BLACIESTIIITIL 
Words by IL W . 
LONGFELLOW. 
Music by W. H. Weiss, 
Under a 
spre ding chestnut tne 
The village smithy stands: 
The smith, a 
mighty man is he, 
With large and sinewy hands, 
And the muscles of his brawny arms 
Are strong as iron ban..ls. 
His hair is crisp, and black and long , 
His face is like the tan; 
His brow i
3 wet with hone t 
sweat. 
He earns what& e he can,-
And looks the whole world in the face, 
For he owes not any man. 
Week in, week out, from morn ' till n 
You can hear his hel ows bio ; 
You can hear him swing his heavy sled,-,-e, 
With m asured bet and WOW, 
Like a 
sexton ringing di,: village bell 
When evening sun is low. 
And children coming home from school 
Look in at the oven door— 
They love to see the flainnIg forge 
And hear the bellows roar, 
And ca,teh the sparks that fly 
Like chair from from a 
thrt.shing floor. 
He goes on Sundly to the church, 
And s'ts amongst his boy- ; 
He hears the par,on pray and preach; 
He hears his daughter's voice 
Sinning in the village choir, 
And it makes his heart rejoice ; 
It sounds to him 1.ke her mother's voice 
Singing in P.radise 
Be needs must think of hcr o:.ce more, 
How in the grave she lies, 
And with h 
s 
lard r 
ugh hand he wir es 
A 
tear from out his eyes. 
Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing, 
Onward through lire he goes: 
Each morning sees some task begnr., 
Each evening se 
it.- close; 
Something attempted, sf . n.ething &re, 
Has crned a 
night's repose. 
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy fr en, 
For the lesson thou host aught; 
Thus at the flaming forge of lite, 
Oar fortunes must be wrought; 
Thus, on its sounding anv,1 staped 
Each burning deed, each thought.

GET YOUR HEAD ABOV E TH E CROWD. 
W ords and Music by JOSEPH P. 
SKELLY,

H ARDING, 229 Bowery, New 
York. Price 10 cents. 
Copyright, 1875, by E. II. HARDING. 
DON'T pine away throughout the day 
Nor grieve about the morrow; 
The man who takes a 
load of care 
Is sure to gain some sorrow; 
While thro' the path of life you go, 
Shrink not beneath a 
cloud, 
But show yourself a 
solid man, 
And rise above the crowd. 
CHORUS. 
Get your head above the crowd, 
And with courage be endow'd ; 
Never seek for care, but with laughing air, 
Meet the world so stern and proud; 
If you seek for love or fame 
Or a 
grand and lofty name, 
Make a 
gallant fight for the end so bright, 
Get your head above the crowd. 
In ev'ry struggle we endure, 
In ev'ry game we're playing 
Of chances we are never sure, 
And things oft look dismaying; 
But we should never falter then, 
Tho' Fate seems cold and proud ; 
Our motto should be: " Do and dare!" 
'Till we rise above the crowd. 
Get your head, etc. 
When Washington his battles fought, 
He let no trouble blind him; 
But gain'd the freedom which he sought, 
And glories left behind him; 
He did not mourn a 
day's defeat, 
But thro' the dangers plow'd; 
It was his glory and his aim 
To rise above the crowd. 
Get your head, etc. 
UP THE GLEN AT WATKINS. 
As sung by JEPPE with great success. 
UP the glen at Watkins I 
strolled one lovely day, 
My mind was filled with wonder that took my breath away; 
At fist I 
did not see a 
young and smiling gent, 
Whose air was bold and free, and look was quite intent; 
At last I 
heard a 
sigh, and casting up my eye, 
I 
met his smile so sweet, it made my poor heart beat; 
I 
was so young and tender, only thirty-one. 
Oh! spare my blushes, must I 
say my hand was all my own. 
CHORUS. 
All! up the glen at Watkins I 
met that lovely day, 
The cruel, cruel man that stole my heart away; 
I 
was so shy and gentle, and only thirty-one, 
And yet I 
found my trials surely had begun. 
He looked at me so sweetly, as I 
have said before, 
I 
felt that I 
could love him then and ever more; 
His form it was so graceful, his eye it was so keen, 
lie had such darling whiskers, and such a 
noble mein; 
And then he'd such a 
bow; I 
turned my head away, 
I 
don't know hardly how, and could not really say; 
I 
was in such a 
state with maiden bashfulness, 
I'd met a 
man, and fell in love and was so full of bliss. 
Ah! up the glen, etc. 
And now I 
looked again where lie so nobly stood, 
His hat was in his hand, a 
graceful attitude, 
And now I 
thought I'd hear the voice I 
knew was sweet, 
And bent my modest gaze his sparkling eyes to meet ; 
But just when his sweet lips were opening with a 
word, 
A loud terrific noise we just behind us heard— 
A crowd of ruffian men were coming towards us fast, 
And one cried, " Woa, my prison bird, I've got you safe at last." 
CHORUS . 
'Twas up the glen at Watkins, that bright mid-summer day, 
I 
saw them take my love, and carry him away; 
I 
don't believe him guilty of any awful crime, 
I 
know that Led have asked me for this hand of mine.

ETCETERA.—Concluded.

I 
spoke to her, she was not vexed, 
I 
lingered by her side, 
I 
thought—has she a 
father, now, 
Or worse—is she a 
bride; 
Beneath her dress a 
natty boot 
Forth peeping I 
could see, 
With such a 
dainty foot, I 
mused 
What must her andes be.—Cno. 
3 
She stood and leaned against the rails, 
The naughty wind it blew, 
And showed her pretty ancles, but 
Of course she never knew; 
She heeded not, why should s'oe care, 
No harm was meant to be, 
And then I 
thought, she little knew 
Her wades I 
could see.—Cuo. 
1 
We chatted till the moon came up, 
Across the wide sea foam, 
And then I 
offered her my arm 
And saw her to her home; 
For midi,' 
months I 
courted her 
Our love was sweet to see, 
And every day at five o'clock 
I'd call and have my tea. - Ono. 
5 
I 
need not say, she is my wife, 
For one fine afternoon, 
I 
married her and rushed abroad 
To spend the honeymoon; 
She is the one I 
dearly prize 
All other gifts above, 
For days and weeks and months go by, 
And still we dearly love.—Cao. 
6 
I'd recommend all single men 
At once to take a 
wife, 
For I 
believe there's nothing half 
So sweet as married life; 
When tired from business you return, 
Refreshed by your wife's charms, 
Your weary feeling is dispelled, 
You clasp her in your arms.—Cno.

A 
wedding sure will be the end, 
With all the fashion's capers; 
But I'll not tell, ' twill be told so well, 
In all the daily papers; 
I'll love him, " oh, dear !" won't I ? 
Well, " that's right," I 
hear Pa say. 
Though mother says, etc 
So some fine night, just out of spite, 
To end my Harry's bother, 
mitten some ten of my love-sick men, 
And give my hand to my lover; 
Now Pa says he admires my choice, 
And I'm his pet they say.

Dov.•.N in the valley where the honey bee sips 
The sweetness from many wild flow'rs, 
They have made her a 
grave, our sweet Imogene, 
The darling we love to call ours; 
The buttercups bend their bright heads o'er the mound, 
The daisies they grow by her side, 
And often we sit near that sweet sacred spot 
To weep for the dear one that died. 
CHORUS. 
Under the buttercups, bright yellow buttercups, 
Darling is sleeping, sweet Imotrene fair ; 
Under the buttercups, bright yellow buttercups, 
Imogene, darling, rests quietly there, 
She left in the summer, the birds on the trees 
Were caroling sweetly the day 
That the angels from heaven came to our door 
And took little dewdrop away; 
She left with a 
smile on her lips, pretty one, 
She bade us a 
loving " good night," 
Then down in the valley they made her a 
grave, 
And laid her 'neath buttercups bright. 
Under the buttercups, etc.

COME to the window, love, come quick, my pretty dove, 
Lovers in plenty are waiting for thee, 
Show thy sweet, winning face thro' the white curtain lac-, 
Darling, make haste, we are anxious to see; 
Wake from thy happy dreams, for gentle starlight beams 
Shine on your window so charmingly bright. 
Birdies their carols cease, neighbors now rest in peace, 
Come in the calm of this sweet summer night. 
List to the music, dove, hear the sweet songs of love 
That we are singing so sweetly for you, 
Come to the window, pet, that we may not forget 
She who is beautiful, loving and true ; 
Slumber no longer, dear, while many beaux are near, 
Wake, now awake, if you take but a 
peep 
At many friends of yore, you often met before, 
Who then will leave you to nature's sweet sleep.

W ELL, there, I'm so delighted 
I 
don't know what to do, 
I 
feel so awful proud, boys, 
Now tell me. wouldn't you 
When married but a 
twelvemonth, 
Yes, to my heartfelt joy, 
Our union it was West 
With a 
bouncing little boy. 
SPOREN.— I 
was delighted at hearing one day— 
Dada! Mamma) come see ! 
Well, I 
declare! 
Baby's got a 
tooth ! did you ever 
Well, there ! tralla! 
I'll strike 
Pray share my joy, 
What is more delightful 
Than a 
first tooth in one's boy 'I 
Yes, I 
was sittin-T smoking ( sewing), 
Was reading " Tweed " had gone ; 
Wonder'd if he'd meet Genet, 
If Connor felt forlorn ; 
When to my (Treat surprise a 
shout 
Ran y
- shrilly in my ear, 
Our baby's got a 
tooth, dada! mamma) 
Come kiss the little dear. 
SPoKEN.—Who could resist it ? 
Kiss it 
Of course I 
did, 
over and over again ! 
Nurse says its the picture of its dada 
(

BABY'S GOT A TOOTH.—Concluded. 
(mamma), of course it is ! 
Well, it's no use talking ; all I 
can 
think of is— 
Dada (mamma), come, etc. 
Now maybe you will not believe 
flow happy I 
did feel; 
That day I (dear) lost some thousands, 
But then I 
didn't squeal; 
My mind was occupied that day 
With only one idea, 
'Twas baby's got a 
tooth—oh ! joy! 
The precious little dear ! 
SPOKEN.—It's true 1 
had to walk the floor with it half the 
night, and heat the paragoric over the gas, and nearly froze; 
but then imagine a 
father's ( mother's) joy as he ( she) thought 
of— 
Dada (mamma), come see, etc. 
I'd let it bite my finger, 
And then ' twould chew my thumb ; 
It seemed to please it really, 
With .joy I 
was quite dumb. 
The day twas born I 
felt so glad— 
'Twas nothing unto this ! 
Our baby's got a 
tooth, I 
know, 
Excuse a 
father's ( mother's) bliss. 
SpoKEN.—Why, really I 
had to avoid all my intimate acquain-
tances that day, for I 
felt, so happy that I'd have given my 
last cent away I 
actually believe. 
Why, Araminta Flapjack 
came in with tears in her eyes and said, " Have you heard the 
news ?" 
I 
said, " Why of course ! 
our baby's got a 
tooth." 
uli ! 
no," she cried, with an additional burst of grief; " ins-
mother is dead!" 
Well, then, you can imagihe my ecstasy, 
when I 
could not see her grief without being told. 
I 
said, 
" 
My dear, I 
sympathise with your grief, but I'm so overjoyed, 
for this morning dada (mamma) said "— 
Dada (mamma), come see, etc.

Price 35 cents. 
Copyright, 1874, by FREDERICK BLUME. 
A MAN once kept a 
fighting dog, 
A bob-tail'd, hungry cuss, 
And that ' ere dog got that ' ere man 
In many an ugly muss ; 
For the man, you see, was muscular, 
And the dog was on his bite, 
And to kick that snappish anitnile 
Was sure to raise a 
fight. 
CITORUS• 
So never keep a 
fighting dog, 
Do anything but, that ; 
Or you may find your fiLzhting dog 
May tackle the wrong Tom cat. 
A woman kept a 
Thomas cat, 
That fit at fifteen pound, 
And other eats made sudden tracks, 
When that ' ere Tom was round ; 
The man and dorg came ' long one day, 
Just where the woman sat ; 
The brute he growled ferociously, 
Then pitched into ye cat. 
So never keep, etc. 
He tried to Crum the pussy's neck, 
The cat would not be chaw'd, 
But nimbly hopp'd upon his back, 
And bit, and scratch'd, and claw'd; 
The hair it flew, the pulp he howl d, 
While claws went thro' his hide, 
And streaks of flesh fell from his back, 
He flutnus'd, kick'd, and died 
So never keep, etc. 
The man he swore a 
fearful swear, 
And seized a 
large brick bat, 
That he'd he darn'd essentially, 
Or kill that Thomas cat; 
The woman vow'd that he should not, 
She owned an old shot- gun, 
She fir'd, and hit his off hind- leg, 
W ith gun-shot number one. 
So 
never keep, etc.. 
(1) 
TTTF. 
FIGHTING DOG.—Concluded. 
They bore him home on a 
trindow-blind, 
The doctor sewed him up; 
He never tried to fight again, 
Or keep another pup ; 
Some people may despise my rhymes, 
A 
fig say I 
for that; 
I 
want to show that a 
fighting dog 
May tackle the wrong Tom cat. 
So never keep, etc.

kiSS'd iiie, and I 
knew ' twas wrong, 
For he was neither kith nor kin ; 
Need one do penance very long 
For such a 
tiny little sin ? 
He press'd my hand, that was not right, 
Why will men have such wicked ways I 
It was not for a 
minute quite, 
But in it there were days and days ! 
Bat in it there were days and days I 
There's mischief in the moon I 
know, 
Last night I 
surely saw her wink, 
When I 
requested him to go, 
I 
meant it too, I 
almost think. 
But after all, I'm not to blame, 
lie took the kiss— I 
do think men 
Are quite without a 
sense of shame; 
I 
wonder when he'll come again I 
I 
wonder when he'll come again?

HARDING. 
'TwAs in the twilight that I 
saw 
A 
face I'll ne'er forget, 
'Twas in a 
crowd upon Broadway, 
That she and I 
first met; 
Her step was like a 
fairy queen, 
Her eyes were saucy brown ; 
Her foot would make an angel weep, 
The prettiest in the town. 
CHORUS. 
She's the prettiest in the town, 
And her name is Josie Brown ; 
She's just like a 
fairy, 
So handsome and so shy; 
-Such lovely teeth and golden hair, 
And wicked, killing eye. (Dance.) 
The next time that I 
met my love, 
'Twas at a 
matinee; 
I 
was longing then to speak to her, 
But knew not what to say ; 
Just then, by chance, she dropped her fan, 
I 
watch'd her all the while ; 
I 
pick'd it up, she thank'd me then, 
With such a 
winning smile. 
She's the prettiest, etc,. 
I 
now thought that I'd speak to her, 
I 
did so without fear ; 
I 
ask'd if I 
might see her home, 
This pretty little dear; 
She then said yes ; we're married now, 
I 
love this Josie Brown ; 
And all the people say I've got 
The prettiest in the town. 
She's the prettiest, ete. 
WHAT SHOULD MAKE THTILE EAT, MY DAR-
LING 1
3 
As sung by ED. FRENCH.. 
WHAT should make thee eat, my darling. 
Pork and beans and mutton stew, 
Lam and veal, and roasted turkey, 
Hearts and livers, kidneys too, 
Sour krout, sausages, and limburgr, 
Eggs and oysters, bread and crust 7 
If you do not quit your gorging, 
Darling, you will surely bust. 
Beets and turnips you devour, love, 
Sweet potatoes take your eye, 
Cucumbers, cabbages, and string-beans, love, 
Heavy on your stomach lie; 
Quail on toast and prairie chicken 
Taste so lovely, so you say; 
I 
should think so, for you eat, love, 
Sixteen good square meals a 
day. 
Pickled eel's feet, stewed canaries, 
Pig's feet broiled in kerosene, 
Elephants stuffed with sarsaparilla, 
Donkey's ears with pork and beans, 
Beeswax fried in black molasses, 
Oysters stuffed with Arctic whales, 
Or frogs in glue prepared in fine cut, 
Hoopskirts broiled on monkey's tails.

THERE IS NO HARM IN KISSING.

DiTSON 45.; Co., 277 Waal, 
ington st., Boston. 
Price 40 cents. 
UPON the rustic bridge we met 
One afternoon in sprina ; 
His loving words I 
can't forget, 
Within my ears they ring! 
The swans were sailin a 
on the lake, 
And all the park was gay; 
My hand in his he chanced to take 
In such a 
charming way I 
The flowers were briolit, but oh, his eyes 
They shone like stars of night; 
His smile was like the glowing skies, 
And filled me with delight ; 
I 
seemed in love's delicious dream, 
My heart with rapture beat, 
And while his eyes (lid on we beam, 
I 
heard his lips repeat, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear I 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park." 
We strolled Mono where roses grew, 
And all was bright and fair; 
He promised ever to be true, 
And begged my love to share. 
The little birds were flying home; 
They heard my lips reply, 
And stars were bright in yonder dome 
Before we said 
(
1) 
; 
THERE IS NO HARM IN KISSING.—Concluded. 
But oh, he seemed so sad to leave— 
My heart grew sad as well, 
For love within each heart did weave 
Its dear bewitchino spell ! 
We lingered though the hour was late. 
How quick the time had sped! 
But when our lips met at the gate, 
He softly to me said, 
" 
There is no harm in kissing ; 
Pray tell me, is there, dear'? 
Those rosy lips invite me now, 
And no one lingers near! 
Then loving ones are meeting— 
No prying eyes to mark— 
There is no harm in kissing 
At twilight in the park."

LOST in the wide world, hopeless and weary; 
Gone is the oladness that made life so dear! 
Dark is my pathway, lonesome and dreary ; 
No smile to cheer me is lingering nea-! 
Once bloom'd around me life's fairest roses; 
Loved ones and fond ones now cheer me no more; 
Lost in the wide world, while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest me in sweet days of yore.

Lost in the wide wo71(1 while calmly reposes 
Each heart that blest mn

Lost in the wide world, wand'ring in sadness, 
Dreaming of dear ones who left me in tears, 
Stars of the midnight whisper with gladness, 
" 
Los ed ones are waiting, then hush all my fears !" 
_Oh, how I 
miss them, life's lovely roses ! 
Sweet voices call me to yon further shore !

THINGS MIXED. 
As sung by HARRY STANWOOD. 
Ara.—" Mabel Waltz." 
' I 
BOUGHT my 0.1 a 
Thomas cat, 
She gave it the name of Julia; 
I 
told her that she mustn't do that, 
For it wasn't that kind of a 
kitten ; 
She swore that she would be revenged, 
She'd go and cut her wizen; 
So she took a 
dose of suicide, 
And then committed arsenic. 
The boy stood on the burning deck, 
With his baggage checked for Troy; 
His hat flew off, and broke his neck, 
And his name was Mrs. M ,
.:Ginnis. 
Adam was the first man, 
As everybody knows, 
He never paid any tailor's bill, 
For he he never wore no clothes.

" 
I'd like to get married," says Dan to Fun, 
That's the way the story goes ; 
Says Fan, " I 
quite approve of the plan,"— 
That's the way the story goes. 
Dan said, " Go get your parents' consent;" 
Fan said 
she would," and away she went, 
Looking so fair mad innocent,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
THAT'S THE WAY—[CoNc-Lcrinrs. 
As Fan was going down Nassau Street, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Another young man she chanced to ! nee% 
That's the way the story goes; 
He looked so shy and winked his eye, 
To escape his glances Fan did try, 
'Twas all in vain, he gave her a 
pie,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
The pie, it gained the heart of Fan, 
That's the way the story goes; 
The rival of Dan was a 
penny piernan, 
That's the way the story goes. 
Fan gained her father's and mother's consent, 
To get married, and off with the pie-ma! went,„ 
But since that day she's had cause to repent,— 
That's the way the story res. 
For coming away from church that day, 
Thai's the way the story goes ; 
A German band began to play, 
That's the way the story goes; 
And fri ,litened a 
horse in front of a

Knocked down and killed the poor pienum, 
And made a 
widow of faithless Fan,— 
That's the way the story goes. 
Now, broken-hearted, about the streets, 
That's the way the story goes; 
Faithless Fan her Dan oft meets,  
That's the way the story goes ; 
He heeds her not, but passes her by ; 
All hot two a- penny " she hears him cry ;

THAT'S TIM, PROPL1R CAPER. 
Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, by E. 
H. H AIMIIM, 
in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington, D. C. 
AM a 
man of easy mind, 
I 
know no care or woe, 
I 
make myself agreeable 
Wherever I 
may go; 
My friends 1 
count them by the score— 
The reason I 
will tell, 
I 
always do things properly, 
And consequently well, 
That's the proper caper, that's the proper caper; 
When things are done in proper style, I 
always like to say, 
That's the proper caper, that's the proper caper; be fair and 
True in all you do, for that's the proper way. 
The other day I 
met a 
friend, 
A 
very nice young man ; 
I 
asked him could he dine with me; 
Of course he said, I 
can ; 
We dined and wined in sumptuous style. 
And smoked our Henry Clays; 
And when we parted he remarked, 
My friend, I 
like your ways. 
That's the proper caper, etc. 
My sweetheart is a 
pretty girl, 
So lovely and so fair; 
Some day she's going to marry me, 
My future life to share ; 
A 
rich young man was after her, 
But his love she could not see; 
She told him he was not the thing, 
She rather fancied me. 
That's the proper caper, et,e.

WHERE'S ROSANNA GONE.--[CONcLunEn.] 
Of her dad I 
was afraid, 
He's a 
disagreeable tanner, 
And he's often promised faithful 
He'd dislocate my neck. 
Chorus.--So I 
used to kiss Rosanna just behind the kitchen door, 
But I 
ne'er shall squeedge, Arc. 
Of an evening after tea, 
While her daddy blew his 'bacca, 
I'd seek my love Rosanna, 
And ask her to share my lot. 
But when he found it out, 
Oh my! how he would whack her, 
While I'd jump over the garden-wall, 
As though I'd just been shot. 
Co.--I 
shall never kiss my love, & e. 
I'd jumped over the wall one night 
In search of sweet Rosanna, 
And though I 
gently whistled, 
My love did not appear; 
But my hair stood bolt upright, 
For out mole her dad, the tanner, 
Oh I 
my teeth they rattled like dominoes, 
And my legs doubled up with fear. 
Spoken.—At the end of our interview I 
felt convinced that he 
understood what " tanning" was, and so did L I 
also concluded 
Cho.—I 
shall never see my love, &c. 
Some say she's hid away 
By her cruel dad on purpose, 
To cure her of her love for me, 
Some say my love's no more. 
If she's defunct, then soon 
Shall they find my clay-cold corpus, 
And our ghosts shall come, and frighten her dad 
Behind the kitchen door. 
slaall never kiss my love, cte.

THAT'S WHERE I 
KNOW YOU ARE RIGHT. 
As sung by jENNIE HUGHES. 
Goon people, I 
ask you to listen. 
And heed what I 
say in my song. 
Common sense is the best kind of tutor, 
It teaches us right from wrong. 
There's two ends you must know to a 
string, boys, 
So be careful when you fly your kite, 
Have a 
care that she don't go too high in the air, 
That's where I 
know you are right ; 
Fair play is a 
jewel we must dearly prize, 
So be impartial, my boys in a 
fight ; 
You must always believe what you see with you're eyes, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Whenever you go on a 
pie-nic, 
Enjoy yourselves, have lots of sport, 
Take your girl, your father and mother, 
Good lager beer, sherry and port, 
Don't stand still and look like a 
Quaker ; 
Be merry, cheerful and bright, 
And when there's a 
dance, bounce in for a 
chance, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
It's pleasure, my boys, that keeps us alive, 
So go in for fun day and night ; 
LauTh and grow fat, don't look like a 
cat, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
If you're wise enough to save money 
And send all your children to school, 
The world will call you a 
miser ; 
Just kick ' gainst the world like a 
mule, 
For when you are aged and decrepit, 
From hard work you take a 
respite, 
Then you will say, ' I'm dry on a 
wet day," 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
For money you know, makes the mare go,— 
Don't be stingy, greedy or tight, 
You can be a 
good fellow without being a 
fool, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
Should you marry a 
bad-tempered woman, 
One who could give you a 
look 
That would send you out in the kitchen, 
To wash, to scrub, and to cook ; 
Go tie up your things in a 
bundle, 
Escape from your room in the night, 
As a 
matter of course, take a 
sudden divorce, 
And that's where I 
know you are right. 
To the ladies, God bless you, I 
say the same thing, 
If your're brute of a 
husband gets tight, 
Loch him up in a 
room, heat him with a 
broom, 
And that's where I 
know you are ri&A.

THROW YOUR SHOULDERS BACK, MY BOYS, 
AND CATCH IT ON THE FLY. 
Words by.Semtrat. N. Mrrcnzw... 
Music by N. C. EDWARDS 
The Music of this song is published by G. D. RrssEta.8z Co., 126 Tremont 
St., Boston, Mass. Price 30 cents. 
WitEN playing ball the fellows use 
A 
phrase that's just the thing 
To say to pretty damsels, that 
Are always on the wing ; 
It is not all the used up slang, 
Nor " how is that for high,'' 
But simply is, and nothing more, 
Why, " catch it on the fly." 
cuokus. 
So if you would succeed, my boys, 
In getting what goes by, 
Just throw your shoulders back, my toys, 
And " catch it on the fly." 
While passing down the street at night, 
A 
girl may say to you, 
"Tis chartnimg, ain't it, George, dear 1" 
Or " Gus, how do you do?" 
Some pretty little flirt, perchance, 
May wink her cunning eye, 
And should you like to walk with her, 
Why, " catch it on the fly." 
So if, etc. 
If on a 
Sunday afternoon 
You at a 
window sit, 
It's 110 one's business I 
am sure 
If you should flirt a 
bit; 
But should the female throw a 
kiss 
As she went tripping by, 
'Tis worthless to you lest, my boy, 
You " catch it on the fly." 
So if, etc. 
Now, friends, my little song is done, 
I 
hope there is no cause 
For you to sit in quietness, 
Or hold back your applause; 
If in my dancing you should see 
Some step you'd like to try. 
Why, call tne back and have them all, 
But " catch them on the fly." 
So if, etc.
