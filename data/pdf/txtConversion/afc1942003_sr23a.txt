"Dear Mr. President", Middlebury, Vermont, January or February 1942
AFS 6422A
Jack Holliday: The treacherous attack upon Pearl Harbor has convinced every thinking American that
we must fight for our democratic way of life, if it is to survive. There has been no more formidable
challenge to all those finer and higher qualities of civilization for a thousand years. For we must
fight not only powerful armies and mechanized might, but also against the powers of darkness,
against an enemy who sees the resources of the larger part of Europe organized with all the
technique of modern science and hurled them against us with a deceit, treachery, cruelty, and an
absolute contempt for all the rules of morality. But we are confident that the vigor and vitality of our
democracy will overcome this challenge. I, Jack Holliday, a student at Middlebury College am reading
this for Allan Kline, professor of American History at Middlebury, College. Professor Kline was unable
to speak due to illness.
