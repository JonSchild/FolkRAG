Abstract: Cecil E. Tabler lives on his farm in Tablertown. He originally had almost 200 acres of
very good river bottom-land ground, which he had but had recently had to sell all but 48 acres of
it because he could not afford the taxes on it. He was born in Tablertown during the Great
Depression. He came from a large family, and they were so impoverished that he left for
Columbus when he was sixteen, and was homeless for a while. He was determined to be a
farmer, and with his wifeâ€™s help they bought back the land his family had lost during the Great
Depression (land that had been in the family since the 1830s).
