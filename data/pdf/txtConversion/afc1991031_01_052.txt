Although two weeks are a very short time to do any kind 
of fieldwork, I came home from the Colorado project feeling that 
I had gained much valuable practical experience, I was particularly 
pleased to participate in the very beginning of a long-term project 
aimed at establishing an outdoor museum. Ever since I have 
visited some of the fine folklife museums in Denmark, Germany and 
Great Britain, this type of museum has been one of my areas of 
special Interest in the field of folklife studies. Therefore I 
consider the Colorado project a great learning opportunity and I 
hope to continue working on this project. 
Our small team consisting of Dr. Howard Marshall (Rusty) and 
two interns, Barbara Orbach and I, with the occasional addition of 
John Farr, the dynamic local coordinator and founder of the Rocky 
Mountain Continental Divide Foundation, proved to be very compatible. 
We were exceptionally well provided for with John Farr generously 
offering us hospitality, office space and a jeep for our trans¬ 
portation. Thanks to his efforts Barbara and I were put up in a 
luxurious,, brand new house, affording us ample space and privacy. 
These were ideal fieldwork conditions. 
The almost constant attention given us interns by Rusty Marshall 
and the chance to learn by observing his fieldwork techniques were 
worth many classroom hours. This kind of practical training is 
not available to folklore students at U.C. Berkeley, where no 
fieldwork courses are taught in folklore. The teaching method

by example, be it drawing, measuring and analyzing log buildings, 
or interviewing ranchers, or using the fine Nagra tape recorder, 
was a very effective method for me, as I first observed Rusty and 
then tried the newly learned skills myself. No classroom in¬ 
struction can equal the experience of being in the field, dealing 
with ’real' people and making decisions from day to day, particu¬ 
larly in a situation such as ours when it was necessary to squeeze 
as much research as possible into a short two weeks. 
'This short time allowed for was the worst problem I encountered 
during the project. By the time we had established some rapport 
with three ranchers and their families, and by the time I had begun 
to feel confident using the equipment and applying the newly ac¬ 
quired skills, the fieldwork period was over. 
During these two weeks our efforts were concentrated on re¬ 
cording the ranching history and documenting old log buildings in 
the Blue River Valley area. We looked at three particular ranches 
in detail. Our first object of study, the McKee ranch, had only 
recently been acquired by the McKee family. During this summer the 
family included I. W. (‘Pa’) McKee and his wife Vera ('Ma'). their 
son Dick with his wife Loma, their daughters Mary and Doris, their 
daughter 'Big Vera* with her husband Wes Dunaway, together with a 
motley assortment of children. 'Ma' McKee enjoys the life on the 
ranch, especially the irrigation work; Doris, a lithographer and a 
refugee from the city, prefers to be a ranch hand at the present;

Wes Dunaway, If given a choice, would rather be a rancher. How¬ 
ever, because of the small size of their land, the family has to 
rely on Income from outside business, such as provided by *Pa' McKee 
driving a truck, Dick and Loma running an excavation business, 
Wes working at the AMAX mine. Accordingly, the old log buildings 
on the McKee ranch, our focus of Interest, are either in picturesque 
disrepair (except for the main house) or are put to alternate use 
rather than housing the cows, pigs, chickens, grains of a working 
ranch. The trucks, cars and trailers parked in-between the old log 
buildings are more important to the economic survival of the McKees 
than the old log barns inherited from a former owner of the ranch. 
Observing them at their daily routines, breaking the ice when 
I went along wood-cutting, I grew fond of the McKees. For a short 
period we became a fixture of their daily lives as they good- 
naturedly allowed us to scramble around the ranch, taking photos 
and recording the log buildings, collecting their life histories. 
The friendly rapport was increased when we joined the square dance 
practice of the Summit County 4 Squares with 'Pa' McKee calling. 
Quite the same happened at the Knorr ranch. Although we in¬ 
truded upon them at the busiest time of the haying season, Karl and 
George Knorr, George’s grandson Greg and Mrs. Enders grew increasingly 
friendly and talkative with each of our successive visits to the 
hay meadows, culminating with an evening spent interviewing Karl 
Knorr in detail. 
Ey contrast to the McKee place, the large and prosperous Knorr

ranch along the Green Mountain Reservoir belongs to oldtimers. 
The Knorr family has owned the ranch since the late 19th century. 
The site of the old log buildings was shifted to their present 
location In 1942, before the Green Mountain Reservoir was created 
and flooded the original homestead. The ranch Is operated by the 
brothers Karl and George, both oldtimers in their sixties. Young 
Greg worked the hay for a very specific reason only: to pay off his 
new truck. At this time of his life he does not seem interested 
to work on the ranch permanently. By contrast Mrs, (Karl) Knorr, 
who came to teach school in Heeney and subsequently married the 
rancher, thus following the plot of many formulaic Western novels 
and movies, meanwhile has become an eminently efficient housewife, 
ranch hand, gardener, hunter, mechanic, owner of an antique shop, 
perfectly adapted to the old and new requirements of life on a 
ranch in the Blue River Valley, 
Toward the end of the fieldwork period_we contacted another 
one of the few oldtlme ranchers left in the area and found a very 
different situation again at Charlie Lund’s ranch at Slate Creek, 
Born in Denmark, Charlie came to this country with his family at 
the young age of two. The present ranch was purchased by the Lund 
family in 1918 and all the log buildings, except for a cabin that 
came with the land, were built by the family. Though not as old as 
the Knorr ranch, this ranch and the tiny community of Slate Creek 
C080-ED

have hardly been touched by modern developments. Even if no 
longer used for their original purpose, the log buildings such 
as the icehouse, the milkshed, toolshed (including old tools, skis, 
an old icebox) and in close vicinity the old schoolhouse with its 
adjacent ’teachery’ have remained virtually unchanged. 
Charlie Lund, the 79-year old, semi-retired owner of the Slate 
Creek ranch, is the last surviving member of his family* His Danish 
background aroused my special Interest, but other than the custom 
of eating ’Luchtfisk’ around Christmas time, a special kind of dry 
fish available in Denver specifically for Scandinavian immigrants, 
he did not remember any Scandinavian traditions. Unfortunately 
there was not enough time to probe more deeply into Charlie Lund’s 
life history. 
One cannot help wondering how long these oldtimers, the Knorrs 
and Charlie Lund, will still be around and what will happen to their 
ranches eventually. It becomes an urgent necessity to record and 
preserve the essence of their life styles before they vanish for¬ 
ever. Particularly the Slate Creek ranch suggested to me an ideal 
site for a working ranch museum with its simple log buildings, its 
beautiful setting among creeks, meadows, forest and mountains. 
Moreover, the site lies within reasonable distance from the main 
highway where an interpretive center eventually should point visitors 
to the museum. 
More than learning how to record log buildings and interview 
ranchers, we also got a taste of the nitty-gritty of organizing 
C080-ED

and fund raising activities necessary to get'.such a project off 
the ground. John Farr, the dynamic local personality par ex¬ 
cellence, drummed up support for us in his newspaper column. 
Rusty gave a talk at a Rotarlan breakfast meeting to explain our 
project. These were lessons in what needs to be done to involve 
the community in a folklife project. Finally, to look at museums 
already existing in the area was an Important exercise to recognize 
what was missing and what should be done differently in our future 
museum. 
In short, I found the C080 fieldwork an extremely valuable 
and enjoyable learning experience. Getting acquainted with field¬ 
work techniques and teamwork, I developed a sense of what a folklorist, 
or a folklife specialist, can do 'out there in the real world*. 
Moreover, in the process I grew very fond of the people, the beauti¬ 
ful country, the rarefied air of the Blue River Valley and I hope 
to continue working there.
