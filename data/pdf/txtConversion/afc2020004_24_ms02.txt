I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the Muscogee Creek Nation west of the Mississippi. I grew up 
knowing that we were in lands that we were relocated to from the Southeast. It wasn’t 
something we spoke of frequently, even as it was a known factor of our living. Even the name 
Tulsa means town, or tvlwv in our language, the Mvskoke language.  
 
At our ceremonial grounds when we took breaks or after meals or other family gatherings, I 
always liked to hear those who knew things would speak. I remember hearing someone say we 
should never go back, go back to our homelands, that it was best to leave them behind and 
keep going. I surmised that to go back would stir things up that are better left buried and 
peaceful. 
 
I took a teaching position a few years ago in Knoxville, Tennessee, to return, to go back and be 
closer to our original homelands. My great-grandfather, six generations, used to steal horses in 
Knoxville with his warrior friends. It made sense. The Tennessee River was a major roadway, 
akin to a major interstate. My husband and I lived at an overlook that gave a view of the whole 
city. I knew where we were living and standing where my great-grandfather stood to survey the 
lands with the best horses.  
 
My husband and I drove all over the Southeast while we lived there. One of the most poignant 
places was near Columbus, Georgia, where another part of my family was from. My great-
grandmother, Monahwee’s granddaughter Miley Carr and her family were from there. Her 
father was the brother of Paddy Carr, a resident who is known to this day. He used to run the 
biggest horse racetrack in the East Coast. One of his old houses is still there. I feel so much 
living history in that area and would prefer to live in that landscape if our community was still 
there. Nearby is the Chattahoochee River where the Tie Snake still lives. I can feel our people 
still there. Most of our stories and songs have roots in that place. My poetry has roots in that 
place.  
 
This poem comes from the moment I knew we were going to leave Knoxville and return to 
Oklahoma. I stood at the sliding glass doors, looked out into trees, the blue outline of the 
Smoky Mountains where ancestors once lived, and my spirit asked, “What did you learn here?” 
I went into the kitchen to the table where I wrote and began writing the poems that became 
the book An American Sunrise. This poem, “Exile of Memory” was one of the earliest written of 
the book. It is a narrative sequence about what I found there as I encountered history on that 
bluff above the Tennessee River. I don’t know that I stirred things up. The Old Ones whose 
memory still occupied those places, still occupy those places, were happy to see us.
