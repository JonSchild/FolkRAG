THIS IS THE START OF THE SEPTEMBER 24TH, 1987 INTERVIEW WITH FLY TIER RAY
GAGNON OF 12 1/1 THIRD AVENUE IN LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS.  THIS 
INTERVIEW IS DONE IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOWELL FOLKLIFE PROJECT AND
THE INTERVIEWER IS DAVID TAYLOR:
D:  ...at this time.  Yeah, I see the needle bouncing.  Okay (--)
R:  The needle is bouncing?
D:  Yeah.  So that tells me that [R:  oh yeah], that we're speaking.  [R:  Yeah]  I had thrown the 
wrong switch before.  That's why I need to check to make sure everything is okay.  Now let me, 
let me just ask you again your birthday?
R:  July 18, 1926.  
D:  Okay.  And you told me you lived on Pawtucket Avenue?
R:  Pawtucket Boulevard.  
D:  Pawtucket Boulevard.  
R:  Stockbridge Avenue, which is off Pawtucket Boulevard, across from the bath house
D:  Okay.  Um, was your, did your parents come from Lowell too?
R:  [Screeching sound]  My parent were born, my mother was born in Lowell, [D:  umhm] but 
my father was born in Brockton.  [D:  Oh yeah, yeah]  And they got together and uh, that's where
we lived, on Stockbridge Avenue right off Pawtucket Boulevard for a good many years.  [D:  
Umhm]  Till 1946.  Then I moved here on Lowell Lawrence Boulevard, which is across from 
Duck Island, in 1953 when I got married.  And I moved here in 1960 where I am now as this 
present address.  
D:  Uh huh.  What kind of work have you done through your life?
R:  I've been an automobile mechanic all my life.  
D:  Oh yeah.  Are you still doing that type of work now?
R:  Sometimes, [D:  umhm] when I have jobs.
D:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before we turned on the tape here you were telling me that uh, that you lived on
Pawtucket Boulevard, that obviously the river was, was very close to you all of the time.  
R:  It was.
D:  Uh, I was wondering uh, [screeching sound] what you remember when you were a boy about 
things that you might have done for fun around the river?
R:  Fished for uh, different types of fish.  And uh, did a little trapping, second brook.  [D:  Oh 
yeah]  And uh, work around you know, the river fishing with different people.  [D:  Umhm]  And 
uh, that's about what it amounted to.  Swimming a lot.  
D:  Oh yeah.  Where would you go?
R:  Right there at the bath house.  
D:  Oh yeah, right.  Okay.  
R:  [Chuckles]  And uh, we had uh, we had great things in those years.  We used to have 
carnivals there and everything else.  Now we don't have that no more.  
D:  Hm.  Where were the carnivals held?
R:  Right there, right by the bath house.  [D:  Hm]  Right in that lane right by the bath house.  
See the boulevard wasn't built that way in them days.  Route 113 was just a two lane highway.  
Very small.  Now it's getting bigger and bigger all of the time.  
D:  Umhm.  When you fished when you were a boy what kind of gear did you use?
R:  Casting rod.  [D:  Umhm]  Casting rod with plugs, lures uh, worms, frogs, mice.  [D:  
Really?]  Anything.  
D:  Yeah.  What type of fish would you catch?
R:  Catch some uh, well mostly it was pickerel and large mouth bass.  Not too many small 
mouths in those days.  [D:  Umhm]  Small mouths seems to have come in since they've started 
really cleaning up the river.  [D:  Umhm]  The river's been cleaned up something uh, it's unreal 
the way the river's been cleaned up.  
D:  Is it cleaner now than when you were a boy?
R:  Oh my god yes!  [D:  Yeah]  Oh, so much it's awful.  
D:  [Laughs]  How bad was it then?
R:  Oh, well all of the raw sewerage from Pawtucket Boulevard and Pawtucketville here and 
Centraville all emptied into the river.  
D:  Oh I see.
R:  So now that's, Centraville is all done doing that.  Now they're working in the Pawtucketville 
section.  They've got the roads all dug up all around here.  You probably noticed that when you 
were driving around.  [D:  Yeah]  And they're putting in sewerage lines from Pawtucketville over 
to the Duck Island Treatment Plant.  That's going to take probably another two years to finish.  
They've got the new fish ladder, which I've seen the fish use in oh I'd say two years now.  If only 
people would stop breaking things on it.  Mind their business.  Leave it along.  Let the fish tell 
you where they're going to go.  
D:  Umhm.  People vandalizing it?
R:  Oh yes!  Oh yes!  They've broken that window I don't know how many times.  There's no 
need of that.  [D:  Umhm]  I've seen uh, let's see, uh, [elwise?] shad, carp, some large mouth bass
and some small mouth bass using that fish ladder.  [D:  Hm]  Eels.  And why the government let's
them put lamprey eels in the river, I can't understand that, because that's one of the worse fish as 
far as I'm concerned that you can put in the river.  Because they do, I've got experience with it up
in Vermont, I fish in Vermont quite a bit.  And uh, some of those lakes up there that I fish have 
uh, fish are really marked up from these eels. 
D:  Those are the ones that [few words unclear].
R:  That's right.  They suck right on to them and such the blood out of them.  [D:  Hm]  But that's
(--)  I can't understand why they put them over the ladder in Lawrence.  See in Lawrence they 
have an elevator.  They have to pick them up and they throw them over.  I can't understand that.  
So it's a hard thing to put in your mind when you're putting in something that's a predator to the 
fish.  
D:  Right.  Well obviously since the time that you were small using your casting rod in the river 
till now, you've really gotten very involved in fishing and tying flies.
R:  Well in 1938 I had a friend of my father's, his name was George Gaynor, started me with 
tying flies.  Simple flies at first.  And then he thought that if I would take a course from uh, Fly 
Tiers Guild of England I believe the name of it is, through the mail, that I might help myself out. 
So I did.  I started in '38.  And then around '42 we had like uh, little graduation of exchanging 
letters, and a little diploma, and things like that.  And then I went in the service in the later part of
1943 and I didn't come out till '46.  But I fished in Germany.  I fished in Ireland, in Scotland, in 
England while I was in the service.  But I didn't do much fishing.  I probably had a day here and 
a few hours here.  And you know, just, there wasn't a heck of a lot over there in those days 
anyway.  [D:  Umhm]  Nobody, you had no way of transportation.  So you just, wherever you 
went you went real close by.  
D:  Did you have [unclear] gear with you in the service?
R:  Uh, only when I was in German.  Uh, I went to Germany of April of '44 I believe it was.  And
uh, started (--)  My mother sent me some stuff that I asked for, which took months to get there.  
And then I used whatever available material that I could find in that, the area that I was in.  And 
uh, I didn't have many hooks, so I used to clean a lot of hooks.  And if I lost one I'd nearly cry.  
D:  [Chuckles]
R:  But that's about what I did.  Then I came home in '46, of August of '46, and I tied a little bit 
of flies, not too many.  And then till about 1940, I mean 1953 I didn't tie that many flies. Just 
enough to supply myself and maybe a few friends.  But nothing, nothing what I'm doing now.  
Now I'm doing classics, restorations of salmon patterns, and duplicating things that I never 
thought would exist.  [D:  Hm]  And I can invent a new fly that I can say that's not been done by 
somebody else.  I have one fly that I've been real proud of.  It's "Ray's Biggerbelly".  And that, 
that there is one of my best sellers with tandem flies and a lot of [adex?] flies that they use in the 
bigger lakes in this area of New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine.  And in Michigan I did a lot of 
steel.  I did nine years of steel head fishing in Michigan [D:  oh yeah] in the Spring.  [D:  Yeah]  
Like around April 1st, April 15th to maybe a week, or two weeks sometimes.  One times for 
twenty-seven days.  It was that good.  
D:  Wow!.  What was the name of that fly you said you were proud of?
R:  "Biggerbelly".  [D:  Oh yeah]  I'm making some now.  [D:  Uh]  Right in the back of you 
there, there are some that are already made.  [D:  Oh!]  These things here imitate a bait fish.  
Imitate any, practically any type of bait fish.  I can imitate anything that I want with this 
biggerbelly.  It's using uh, a body that's made just like a fisher's body.  [D: Umhm]  As you see.  
D:  What kind of materials go into these?
R:  Oh this here is silver and gold.  It's special stuff that I found on the market years ago put out 
by Eiser Williams.  And now it's, all of the supply shops, all the sport shops that have fly tying 
material handle it as a, some guys call it silver tinsel, some guys call it uh, name of it, it's uh, 
[silion?].  Some of it, all kinds of names for it.  And there's all kinds of colors.  If you give me 
the thing in the back of you there I'll show you.  [D:  unclear]  No, no.  [D:  The other one?]  The 
other one there. [D:  Yeah]  As you can see, the coloration, see there's three different types in 
there.  And you see how it made the body?  The body is just like as if it's the stripes of a fish.  [D:
Yeah]  Just like the fish would be in the water.  [D:  Umhm]  And it's got nylon over the top and 
peacaw curl.  And peacaw curl represents the top dark part of the little minnow.  And the nylon is
loose, tied in at the back, so that the tail will actually move.  All of these flies, no matter what 
kind of flies you use, you should tie them loose onto your line, onto your leader.  You should 
make like a loop.  Always have a little loop.  So then when you throw it out there it's like free 
flowing.  Its like free movement.  Nothing is dragging.  You're not putting it through the water 
like a piece of stick.  [D:  Umhm]  You're dragging.  You're not dragging it, you're just swimming
it through the water.  And a lot of people are doing that now.  I've been talking about that for 
years and years when I go to sportsmen clubs, but it's very hard to get the fishermen to listen (--) 
Alice, don't make no noise, huh?  [Alice makes comment, cannot hear her]  So it's very hard to 
do things that uh, fisherman don't want to do.  [D:  Umhm]  They're set in their ways.  Some of 
them will use nothing but a wet fly.  Somebody will use nothing but a dry fly.  And as far as I'm 
concerned now, dry flies around here are all done because of the acid rain.  [D:  Hm]  Our acid 
rain is, it's a sorry thing around here.  [D:  Umhm]  And there's nothing you can do about it.  [D:  
Umhm]  So you uh, you just got to put up with it.  [D:  Yeah]  There's not much you can do about
it to fight back on.  Why don't you use the phone upstairs Alice?  [Alice:  All right]  So it won't 
be recorded down here.  Well anyway.
D:  What types of uh, flies are particularly suitable for the conditions in this area?
R:  Well in this area the muddler is probably one of the best flies you can use for the river as far 
as your bass fishing and a few other species that are in there.  Shad darts are real good with 
bumps.  I invented the bump for the Merrimack River.  It's nothing but a piece of chenille that's 
tied on to a hook, instead of a bead put on to a hook.  And uh, it's uh, the bump will probably 
out-fish the darts after you learn how to use it.  [D:  Hm]  But the darts are very effective.  And 
uh, like everything else, guys use spin rods.  If they only went down to four pound test, or two 
pound test, they'd increase their fishing tremendously.  But you can't, again you can't change 
their habits because they don't want to lose the fish.  [D:  Umhm]  There's always one behind it to
catch, [D:  yeah] but they don't think that way.  [D:  Umhm]  After awhile it kind of penetrates 
after you get older.  Young fellows seem to want to use that ten and twenty pound test.  We have 
probably one of the best fishing in the Merrimack River down in Newburyport area.  Amesbury, 
Newburyport, Rockport, uh, Rock Village I should say, into Merrimackport for blue fishing and 
striper fishing.  The striper fishing at the Lawrence dam, which the fish can't come any higher, at 
times is real good.  But now that the fish are thirty-three inches it makes it a lot harder to get a 
keeper, which you're only allowed one a day anyway.  [D:  Umhm]  But there's a lot of people 
that are, they're just fishing for the sport.  They don't injure them.  They don't do nothing to hurt 
them or anything.  You just release them an that's it.  [D:  Umhm]  I've done that now for the last 
six, seven years.  Just release them.  At one time I will admit that I have pictures here as you can 
see that uh, will warp your mind.  [phone rings]
D:  [Chuckles]  If you need to get that. 
R:  No, I'll let her get it.  
D:  Well I think probably most of us have been through that, you know?  [Unclear] come with 
maturity I think.  To know that well you've caught enough and kept enough and now the fun is 
[unclear].
R:  Well I used to sell fish commercially.
D:  Yeah.
R:  At one time.  [D:  Did you?]  I had a license.  And I sold a lot of stripers.  [D:  Oh yeah!]  A 
lot of stripers.  Tons of stripers.  And uh, just had to stop.  [D:  Umhm]  It had to stop someplace. 
[D:  Umhm]  So when it decided that we would stop we just stop putting the boat in the water.  
[D:  Umhm]  So now I've been fishing from shore for the last six, seven years.  [Unclear] eight, 
nine years, fishing from shore.  Go out on a boat once in awhile with some friends, but after you 
don't have a boat friends seem to forget about you.  [D:  Umhm, umhm]  You know.  And I don't 
fish with nobody anymore.  I fish by myself.  You wait for a guy, you wait for fisherman, you 
wait for a person for hours and you even got to practically feel him breakfast at home before he 
can get out of the house.  [D:  Chuckles]  So I just go.  When I want to go fishing, I go fishing.  
That's all there is to it.  
D:  Yeah.  
R:  Don't worry about the other guy.  This year I haven't done as much fishing as I wanted to, as I
did last year.  Last year I got an awful lot of blue fish on a fly rod.  This year I, I didn't get, didn't 
even come close to forty or fifty fish.  Maybe fifty fish at the most.  Last years it was over four 
hundred.  But this year the bait just didn't come into these little sloughs and nooks and crannies, 
and these little creeks and back water and things.  The bait was just not there.  That small bait 
was just not there to bring in the bigger bait that the blue fish feed on.  
D:  Is that where you usually do your fishing, in the lower part of the Merrimack?
R:  No, I've done a lot of it up here, but in the last few years in having to supply the flies to these 
different places, I, I have to do like we'll say, go fishing for an hour or two, then go call on some 
of the customers.  And then sometimes that tide has changed where I'm just going to fish for 
rocks and sticks and things like that.  And grass.  And I don't care to do that.  I want fish for the 
fish when the fish are there.  If I see them I love to fish for them.  If I don't see them, but I do 
catch fish, and then I you know, probably one or two, and then all of a sudden you're just there 
for a half an hour.  And you haven't even got a hit, and you don't see nothing.  And the water has 
changed.  So you just get up and leave.  That's what I do.  And I use Polaroids like a son of a gun.
[D:  Oh yeah]  Polaroids and field glasses, my best friends.  [D:  Umhm.  Yeah, yeah]  Best 
friends.  Birds.  Lately the birds aren't been too active.  The birds give you some false 
information lately.  So I just don't bother.
D:  What kind of information do they give you that's accurate?  What kind, [R:  the birds?] yeah, 
what kind of signs did you (--)
R:  Well we had (--)  The seagulls are so full of, of dying fish that we had in the river for a 
number of years now that the cycles of the [manhadens?] and the herrings dying, that the 
seagulls don't spend their time in to the pods of fish that the blue fish are eating.  They will 
sometimes, but most of the times they got enough food on the shorelines and things like that.  So 
you don't have to worry too much about (--)  The birds don't worry about spending their time like
we'll say in fast current, you know, and picking up a piece here and there.  [D: Umhm]  They 
just, now they just go to the shorelines and they, they find all they want.  [D:  Right]  So they just
don't do that that way.  So the birds now give you, a lot of the bird give you false information.  
So that's what the field glasses come in.  If you don't see busting fish, busting blue fish, or 
busting bass, you just don't bother fishing in that spot.  And if they're not close enough you can't 
reach it with a fly rod anyway.  
D:  When you say busting you mean coming across the top of the water?  [Unclear] water? 
R:  You know, the fish are coming up and they're busting the herrings or [poggies?], and they're 
breaking them up like in pieces.  [D:  Oh]  So the fish, the little fish or smaller pieces are being 
picked up by the, they seagulls and other little, you know, turns and things.  Now you don't, you 
don't have that too often.  It's a (--)  I didn't (--)  This year I've only seen it a few times that they, 
they were really active, but they got all the meat they want from just picking on the shores.  [D:  
Yeah]  We have a lot of eel drafts around Plum Island.  [D:  Umhm]  And in Amesbury and 
Newburyport.  And what happens, a lot of these [poggies?] and herrings go in there and they just 
plainly die.  And they float, and some of them just move a little bit and the seagulls take them 
then.  [D:  Hm]  So you don't uh, and Blue fish don't seem to care to come in and eat those up.  
They eat the ones that are real alive.  [D:  Yeah, (unclear).  So you have to find a spot where 
they're coming in toward shore, or you got to find a spot where they're coming in towards a boat 
landing, or a wharf, or something.  And it's getting tougher and tougher this years.  
D:  Hm.  Are there other types of signs that you read in addition to the birds?  
R:  Well sometimes I try to follow a school of fish.  [D:  Umhm]  And I follow them as far as I 
can, but you run into too, too much of private land.  [D:  Yeah]  You're asked to leave.  The police
is on your back.  And now at Plum Island you can't park anyplace unless you got a permit.  And 
it's very hard to get a permit unless you live there.  [D:  Umhm]  So you just kind of say to 
yourself the heck with it, you know?  [D:  Yeah]  But like after October 1st they don't bother you 
at Plum Island too much.  They will probably come around and tell you to leave at certain times, 
but most of the time they won't.  But see they've got parking lots down there and they want to fill
those parking lots.  [D: Umhm]  They want that two dollars [D:  Right] just like everything else.  
D:  Oh yeah.  Uh, is there much fishing in the river in Lowell now?
R:  Well in Lowell right now, which is, what they're doing is fishing for the large mouth bass, 
small mouth bass, the carp are real big.  Uh, there are some people that are fishing for eels right 
now, because the eels are getting good to eat right now.  And the hornpout are very very big.  The
catfish, some of them are real big, which uh, I've always called them hornpout, but then I, we 
found out through research that we have in the Lawrence's area some nice catfish that are active. 
And some of the guys have broken records from here and there.  
D:  Hm.  Do people use different types of gear for all of those different kinds of fish?
R:  Most of them use spin rods.  It's uh, spin rod is the, the universal fishing of the world now 
anyway.  The fly fishing, the ones that stay to fly fishing all of the time are the ones that uh, well 
they're not actually purest.  I'm not a purest.  I'm not uh, I use bait when I have to.  When I go to 
Vermont and Michigan and those places.  Use a lot of spinners.  And uh, don't seem to, but I use 
fly rods a lot.  [D:  Right]  Mono and fly rod a lot, a lot.  [D:  Umhm]  You know I bought a 
special reel to use on a fly rod that I can use the same way as a spin rod.  [D:  Oh yeah!]  And 
that's, that's been pretty good.  But it's like everything else, I caught too many big fish on it and I 
broke it.  
D:  [Chuckles]  Are there particular spots within the, the city limits of Lowell on the river that 
uh, that people uh, go to in particular?
R:  Well this new power plant is one of the hot spots when the shad were in and the [elwys?].  
Across the river from there is a pretty popular spot for fishing for uh, (--) 
Alice:  Dave, excuse me.  [D:  sure]  When you leave lock the doors. 
R:  Okay.  Where are you going?
A:  I'm going to "Top Hat" to get a T-Shirt for Eric.
R:  T-Shirt for Eric?
A:  Yeah, he said they're cheaper there. 
R:  Yeah.  [A:  All right]  Does he want a fishing shirt?  [A:  I don't know]  Ask him if he wants a 
fishing shirt.  There's one in the car he can have.  [A:  Oh]  Well anyway, don't matter.  I'll use 
them.  Uh, fishing the side of the University of Lowell side, has been (--0
D:  Oh this, this side of the river?
R:  This side of the river has been very productive for a good many people.  Lot of people have 
fished that side of the river and really uh, did great.  Some of the guys fish the other side and uh, 
of the river from Chelmsford, little Tyngsboro, or something like that, but there's a lot of private 
land.  [D:  Umhm]  And you just can't go on that private land.  And some of them it's not, it's 
highly, you can't get to it.  But there's good fishing spots in those places.  [D:  Umhm]  But what 
can you do.  You can only fish in certain areas and that's all there is to it.  
D:  That's fishing from the shore you mean?
R:  Yes.  [D: Yeah]  From shore, or even, if you got a boat and you don't know that there's fish 
there.  These guys now are all using these uh, what do you call it uh, fish finders.   [D:  Oh yeah] 
And some of them have fish finders that are so good that uh, they know there's a fish on the back
of the boat, and they cast for it, and they catch it.  So what are you going to do, you know?  [D:  
Yeah, yup]  A friend of mine just bought a brand new bass master with a machine on it that I 
could not believe what it was doing.  I put a penny on the floor and it picked it up in his garage.  
[D:  Wow]  Showed me that it was a penny on the machine.  
D:  One of the colored screens.
R:  Right.  Right.  
D:  That's amazing.
R:  So there's a lot of people that are using these things.  We have a lot of lakes around here too 
that they, they're using this type of equipment.  Now this type of equipment is showing up on the 
river all over.  [D:  Umhm]  I mean all over.  It's not just one or two boats.  It's hundreds of boats.
[D:  Hm]  And we have, they have fishing tournaments down there.  I amazed at how much 
money some of these people have spent on these boats.  [D:  Umhm]  They're up to fifty and 
sixty thousand dollars.  And with equipment [D:  Wow] and trailers, motors, and everything else. 
Everybody wants something that goes a hundred miles an hour.  [D:  Yeah]  And uh, why, I don't 
know.  If you fished to where you're going you'd probably get a half a dozen fish.  And then 
when you get there you'd probably get two fish.  [D:  yeah]  But that's the way it works.
D:  I guess.  I don't know.  I don't understand it either. 
R:  The human person is very ugly on the water.  [D:  Laughs]  It's the truth.  [D:  Yeah]  This is 
what they do.  So what the heck can you say, you know?  Lot of guys come here and all they use 
is muddlers.  That's all they want is muddlers, muddlers, muddlers, muddlers, muddlers.  Other 
guys come here they don't even want to look at a muddler.  They want biggerbellies.  They want 
them in colors.  They want them in uh, I do them in all, all kinds of different colors.  From uh, 
black to orange, to yellow to chatreuse, greens, dull colors, and everything else.  And they, they 
just, it's all they use.  [D:  Hm]  But they get fish.  [D:  Umhm]  But again they go to a plug, or 
they go to a something, broken back thing, or broken tail thing.  And they get a few fish on that 
and they forget all about the flies until that goes crazy.  And then they go back to a fly, or 
something like that.  You can use a fly with a spin rod and a bubble.  [D:  Umhm]  Uh, we have, I
have bubbles that I use all the time.  I'll show you these.  These are these white little bubbles that 
uh, with an elastic into to them like the tubing of, surgical tubing.  [D:  Yeah]  And you can put 
water in it.  You run your line through it.  And all you do is just run your line through it, pull this 
and turn it, and it uh, makes the elastic(--)  See what it did to the (--)
D:  It twisted it up.
R:  Twisted it around.  Stays on your line to where you want it.  And you put on a fly, you cast it 
out, and you bring it back just like (--)  But you can cast a lot further.  You can get to a hole, or 
[D:  oh yeah] if you want you can throw underneath a little piece of branch, or something and get
a hold of a fish.  
D:  It give it more weight so you can toss it there [unclear].
R:  Right.  [D: Yeah]  And it's always, you're always getting (--)  After you learn how to use it.  I 
use four pound test and two pound test.  And after I use (--)  Uh, when I was using six and eight 
pound test I was getting some fish.  But I think I up my production of fish by probably sixty, 
seventy percent with the lighter lines.  A much lighter lines.  I even had a rod made special to use
just plain four and two pound test.  You use six the rod don't work right.  And I use all kinds of 
things.  I use muddlers.  We have a fly that come from Maine that's named "Woody", which a lot 
of guys use for trout fishing.  Then we have the homburg that came down from Pittsburg.  We 
have Larry Roy's "88" up in Salem, New Hampshire that uh, when he had his sport shop.  That is
a very effective fly.  And yet there's things like Micky Fins and oh, you name it, you know?  
Black nose dace you know, that uh, that imitates a bait fish.  All these things all work, but when 
are they gonna work, you don't know, but the general flies that work all the time is a woody, a 
muddler, and a homburg.  And you can tie homburgs in any colors you want.  A woody I stick 
pretty much to red tail, red throat, peacock body and a wood duck feather over the top.  I don't 
change that hardly at all.  That seems to be the most productive way of tying that fly.  The 
homburgs you can put in some yellow inside, which was the original pattern, some red, some 
green, you can dye mallard feathers red, orange, or any color you want.  Uh, one of the best 
colors I guess is green.  It's like a sea green.  Uh, grass green is good too.  And the, the guys, 
some guys come in here and that's what they want, and that's what I do.  [D:  Hm]  Some others 
can have all of the flies in the world, they can't catch a fish no matter whatever happened.  You 
know?
D:  When, when fishermen come to you to place an order is it usually an assortment like what 
you just described, or?
R:  Oh not, not too often, sometimes.  Sometimes it's a, it's like uh, I hate this, but what can I say.
When you do this type of work you have to do it.  Two of this, two of that, two of this, or two of 
that, or just give me two of that.  I mean I'd rather see them get, like get a dozen and get it over 
with and don't have to come back.  But they'll come back.  [D:  Umhm]  They come back and 
spend their little bit of money at a time.  They feel that it's better that way I guess.  But I had 
some other people that just, they want dozens at a time.  They just order it by the dozen and that's
it.  Those guys you don't see too often, but you see them you know, three or four times a year. 
And that's how you, you do it.  
D:  Do you supply only individual fishermen, or do you [unclear]?
R:  No, I have, I have fly shops that I supply in this general area and up in New Hampshire.  In 
Vermont and Maine.  The Cape waters, some of the Cape waters.  Not too many.  But I can only 
do so many things with my hands.  [D:  Umhm]  I only have so many hours a day.  When I'm not 
delivering kids, I'm working on flies.  That's when I do my flies.  And that's how I get around, 
because I don't have (--)  Like right now I'm only home for a few hours.  I won't get home till 
four, four fifteen.  And it's just too late to go to shops, or go to here, go there.  So I have to do it 
on a Saturday and a Sunday.  And most shops understand it.  They don't want to have you there 
on a Saturday or a Sunday, but they understand it.  And some of them are open on Thursday 
nights.  But there's more and more shops going out of business in this area of New England.  I'm 
talking New England areas going north that have gone out of business in the last two years.  That
can really really but a dent into what people think about fishing.  You take place like Sylas and 
Kittery Trading Post, and L. L. Bean, they'll never go out of business.  They're just too big.  [D:  
Umhm]  They're too big to go out of business.  So the little guy suffers.  We have some shops 
like we say, "call of the wild" up in Derry, New Hampshire.  He survives because he sells other 
things than just fishing things.  [D:  Umhm]  Guns and everything else.  We have shops in 
Lowell, not, there's no fly shop in Lowell.  The only one that has anything at all is uh, as far as 
buying flies is up in Chelmsford.
D:  Is that Bob's?
R:  We have Bob Beans, and we have the Tackle Box in Chelmsford, going to Chelmsford 
Center.  [D:  Oh]  Yeah, there's, the other places around here, there's not many that want to stock 
things.  [D:  Umhm]  They want to stock things they can sell within a few weeks.  [D:  Umhm]  
Then after they've made their money they don't buy anymore.  They've made it and that's it.  
They just say the heck with it.  [D:  Yeah]  You know?  
D:  Yeah.  
R:  A lot of places that are Cortland agents, that have Cortland stuff and they just don't seem to 
re-stock it once it's gone.  You go there to buy some liters, or (--)  I make all my own liters.  I sell
the liters too, and I make them myself.  I do everything with my hands.  [D:  Umhm]  And I have 
a cedar jig plug that outcast anybody in the world.
D:  Really?  Wow!
R:  That's right.  I ain't go many more.  I only got four left. They're mine, but I can't get nobody 
to make them anymore.  Nobody wants to work.  [D: Hm]  Can't hire fly tiers.  It's an 
impossibility to hire fly tiers.  
D:  Now these, these plugs, they were carved out of cedar?
R:  They're uh, they were put into a, like a, a jig, you know?  And uh, when they came out the 
other side they were shaped whole and the lead was pour into them.  It's a cedar jig.  In other 
words it's got lead on the head.  [D:  Umhm]  And uh, everybody tells me I hook it backwards, 
but whether I hook it backwards or not, it works like a charm.
D:  Hm.  And you'd make those one at a time, or did you have [unclear] production?
R:  Oh no, I used to buy them thousands at a time, but I can't buy them no more.  The people 
have all gone out of business.  They're all old.  [D: Yup]  They've all either retired, kids don't 
want to go into that.  The kids make more money today with a computer sitting at home.  So 
they're just going to do this other type of work and not do anything for the fishermen.  Things 
that I do, everything I do I do it in my hands.  [D:  Umhm]  I don't do it machinery except for a 
vice.  [D:  Umhm]  I use a, two types of vice.  I have the Pepere vice here and I have this, which 
is nothing but a pair of vice grips.  
D:  Yup.  You've got another piece, a straight piece welded on there?
R:  Yeah, that's all.  And I even made a vice grip which is over in there, a vice that rotates.  
D:  Yeah.  Oh yeah! 
R:  But uh, you just can't, you can't get nobody to make the parts to put it on the market.  So I 
said the heck with it.  I just do it here myself.  And if you hire somebody, if you find somebody 
that wants to work, after he's done a few dozen flies he's fed up with it.  He wants his money 
right off the bat.  You haven't sold his products yet.  You don't even know you're going to sell it, 
but they want their money.  Sold you just don't bother asking anybody. I don't ask anybody 
anymore.  I just do it myself.  I have something to do I do it myself.
D:  Is this sort of your routine year round?
R:  Twelve months a year.
D:  Umhm.  
R:  Three hundred and sixty-five days a year.  Very very seldom I don't tie up flies in the course 
of a day.  [D:  Umhm]  Sometimes, oh I've had days that I didn't because I was sick with the 
virus or something like that.  I just went to the vice and just couldn't do what I wanted.  So the 
heck with it.  [D:  Yeah]  And you have days also that you got to be very careful of how you tie 
flies because of the weather.  The weather is against you uh, a lot.  Static electricity.  As you can 
see I have that static guard right there. [D:  Umhm]  That's for static electricity in me, you, or 
anybody else that I, when I'm tying flies that I take the static out of the materials.  Because I use 
a lot of materials that are into the nylon, or what do you call it?  The plastic end of the fly 
making.  And all of that stuff has nothing but static electricity into it.  So you (--)  And then a guy
will have a sweater on.  He'll take the fly out of his box and they'll be three or four of them that 
will fly out of the box and go on to the sweater.  So you can't, you've got to be very careful of 
what you make and what you do.  You just can't say, well I'm going to make two dozen flies and 
this guy bought them off of you and something.  You've got to make sure that uh, the static isn't 
there so that you can have problems down the road.  
D:  Umhm.  Can you describe some of the major gear that you have here that you, your tools that
you need to work on the flies?
R:  My hands.  [D:  Umhm]  My hands are my tools.  As you see here I even make my own 
bobbins.  Everything I do is I make it myself.  All you see what I have here is a bobbin, thread, 
pair of scissors, a pair of [unclear] pliers, a pair of bigger scissors to cut the aluminum, hooks, 
and threaders, a threader.  [D:  Oh yeah!]  That's so that I can thread my thread through this 
bobbin.  As you noticed this one here is a lot longer than other bobbins that you see here.  You 
see this bobbin here has got a very small shaft.  A one eighth shaft, where this one here has a, 
now this is a one thirty-two, the other one is a one eighth shaft.  And see how longer it is?  [D:  
Right]  Because of the fact that from here to there is long, so I have to have something to be able 
to work on the outside of the hook instead of working into the hook.  [D:  Umhm]  And that, that 
helps me like a son of a gun.  I had a (--)  They had a thing on TV the other day, this woman's 
name is Teeny.  [D:  Hm]  And they had the teeny fly on there.  And they were doing this and 
they were doing that.  And they asked her, the gentleman that she was talking to up in Alaska, 
they asked her how many of these flies she could tie an hour.  And she made a statement that she 
could do sixty dozen in an hour.  And I nearly, I was sitting in my chair over there reading 
something.  I want to (--)  I nearly fell out of the chair, because I could not, I can't believe this.  
It's an impossibility.  [D:  No]  So she made a mistake, but she probably meant sixty dozen a 
week, or something like that, because the fly is, is a little bit involved.  But uh, you can't tie too 
many flies a day.  [D:  Umhm]  I used to be able to do a gross a day of certain things.  Now if I 
do a hundred homburgs a day, or a hundred woodies a day, I consider myself lucky.  
D:  Is is harder on your hands or your eyes?
R:  No.  I don't see much problems with my eyes or my hands.  It's just that I'm getting older and 
smarter.
D:  [Chuckles]  To my left from the floor to the ceiling there are dozens of plastic boxes.  And 
what (--)
R:  Two hundred, three hundred and twenty of them I think it is.  
D:  Wow!  And what are some of the things that are inside them?
R:  All kinds of things.  There's wooduck, there's mallard, there's teal, there's pintail.  Everything 
is marked.  Uh, there's women's hair.  There's hair rugs.  There's toilet seat rugs, uh, material.  
There's fish hair.  There's all kinds of threads.  On the other side is the bulk stuff that has, that is 
uh, the wild, practically the wild material like the, the furs that I use a lot.  Like grey fox.  [D:  
Umhm]  Some red fox.  Deer hair.  I use an awful lot of deer hair.  [D:  Umhm]  Four to five 
skins a year.  But some of the skins I have to throw pieces away because it's not suited for the 
type of work that's required to do the muddlers for this New England area.  [D:  Umhm]  And uh,
it's all bulk over there.   There's wild turkey.  I don't use a turkey feather unless it comes from a 
tur, wild turkey.  We go turkey hunting every year.  We're fortunate to get six or eight and end up 
with all of the feathers.  Throw most of them away because they're all full of holes from the 
BB's, but a lot of them are good.  You know, keep pieces and you got to clean, do a lot of 
cleaning.  People don't understand.  Fly people that use flies don't, and when they buy a fly, and a
fly we'll say is three ninety- five, and two fifty, or something like that, they feel that the fly is 
only worth a buck.  But they're not, they don't consider that to make that fly you probably had to 
sit down three days to clean all of this material up, then sit down and start tying flies.  [D:  
Umhm]  They don't understand that.  And I use a lot of invisible thread.  So you can't see but the 
raw materials.  And uh, to me that's, that's a better thing to do then putting on black, or red, or 
something like that.  [D: Umhm]  And I, as you see I'm using this transparent stuff [D:  oh yeah] 
like a son of a gun.  I use a lot of that.  And this is invisible thread.  This thread, I can put it on 
there and all it shows is what underneath.  
D:  What fly is that you're making now the vice?
R:  Well this here is just nothing but a biggerbelly that goes along with the Joe's smelt type of 
thing.  The thing is that I've incorporated Joe's materials into this fly and then I make this 
biggerbelly.  As you can see it's not very heavy.  [D:  Yeah]  It's very light.  It can be thrown with 
a fly rod very easily, a spin rod.  Or you control it.  It's a, I make some a little shorter for 
throwing.  These, this type here is for actually throwing.  This is an 8X hook, a number 2.  I 
make them on number 2's like number 6's, or something like that.  Like 4X and 6X.  And then 
when the person is using that he's got a little bit more control over it. These here are mostly for 
trolling.  [D:  Umhm]  This type here.  I make them in, in tandems also the same thing, with a 
hook in the back, and a hook in the front, and with a connector in the middle.  [D:  Umhm]  
Those aren't finished.  Here's some bodies that are finished.  And uh, what I do is I make, I'll 
make like forty-eight bodies [D:  Umhm] of a whole bunch of them at a time.  The reason why I 
only do forty-eight is I go crazy if I made you know, like six, seven dozen.  So what I do is I 
make four dozen at a time.  And I throw them in this box.  You see there's five holes here and 
there's two holes that are filled.  [D: Umhm]  And maybe by next week they'll be two more holes 
that we'll have some tandem hooks in there.  [D:  Right]  And then what happens, I put on, just 
finish the thing and coat it with uh, I used nothing but one of the best stuff that I know of is this 
uh, hard set, really really hard set.  it's like a, it's a plastic.  It's like something that uh, show you 
the name of it.  It's a polyurethane [D:  Yeah] thing.  And I buy it in this type and it's the pure 
stuff.  I don't buy, I don't buy the uh stuff that's uh, [D:  Oh yeah!  It's pure urethane] I have to go 
out of my way.   Make sure it's got the pure on it.  So when I do use it it's clear plastic, it don't 
show nothing.  It's got a high gloss to it and it's a, I don't know how you say it?  But to me it's the
best way of coating something that you want it to stay.  And I have no problem with that stuff.  I 
even put that sometimes on my, different things that I make.  I use to put that on my cedar jigs.  
[D:  Yeah]  And the guy would say to me, "well how come the fish bites the cedar jig and he says
ow!  Or bluefish you know, or something like (--)  You didn't have too many marks on it.  So you
could use the lure longer.  I did that.  All these biggerbellies you see here, the silvers and the gold
ones, and the ones that are made like a body of a fish here all have that coat of that on it after it's 
all done.  It's coated before the hair and the peacock is put on there.  And then after the eyes are 
put on and everything is done, it's got another coat of uh, that hard set.  
D:  I've got to comment on these fine rods that are above the doorway across from us.  Can you 
tell me about some of those?
R:  Well I have probably there, well this is what?  Six rods there I think.  Uh, five, one, two, 
three, four, five, six, yeah, something like that.  These are all fly rods that I've had made by E.L. 
Witham in Lynnfield, Mass.  They're all one piece.  There's, some of them are, one there is nine 
foot six.  that's one piece with a big multiplying Shakespeare fly reel that I use for uh, fishing.  
Well a lot of people don't understand this, but I fish for shark sometimes with a fly rod.  
D:  Wow!
R:  And the sharks are anywheres from oh, ten pounds to forty, fifty, sixty pounds.  [D: Umhm]  
Uh, the bigger sharks that I've caught, I've caught them on spinning gear, heavy duty spinning 
gear, [D:  Umhm] or trolling gear.  Like tuna gear.  It's uh, eighty pound class, or something like 
that.  [D: Yeah]  But that, that one on the bottom there, and the other one is a, is a casting rod that
uh, well I won a lot of tournaments with it.  Then the others are all fly rods that I had built by E. 
L. Witham, those four there.  They're all one piece.  And uh, they handle to line very well.  
They're all glass.  [D:  Yeah]  The reason why they're up there now is I've gone to [bouron?].  I've
gone to [roudon bouron].   And I use that roudon bouron like a son of a gun, because it's ten 
times better to cast than the glass.  [D:  Hm]  But if I was to go to a small stream or a small lake I
would use one of these glass rods. 
D:  Excuse me just a minute, I could use a flip.  [Turns off tape and flips to side two]
SIDE ONE ENDS
SIDE TWO BEGINS
R:  The uh, the fishermen around these areas, all over these places have a very uh, bad habit.  
They all think because K Mart, and Sylas, and all of those, L.L. Beans, and all these places sell 
you a commercial rod that's built by commercial people.  And they think that that's the best way 
to buy a rod.  I found out years ago that if you went to a custom rod builder that you knew, and 
that he would understand the way you wanted to fish, that the custom rod builder could 
practically build you a rod that would fit your hand, your arm, your shoulder, your legs, your 
height, your weight, and the whole works.  And the reels don't matter too too much, but it's like 
everything else.  Hardy shoves it down to you that they've got the best so a lot of people buy 
Hardy.  But I've had a lot of, lot of fun with [flugers?].  [D:  Umhm]  And uh, I have one Marten 
Reel in my life and I'll never have another one.  [D:  Umhm]  It's a, it was nothing but a problem 
every time I went fishing with it.  So, but that's what I use.  I use a lot of hardies and uh (--)  Not 
a lot.  I only got maybe, I got three of them.  But I have [flugers?] that uh I fish in salt water with
for years that are not even worn out.  [D:  Hm]  They're just, they're not even, not even scorched. 
[D:  Umhm]  It's because I take care of them.  I clean them, lube them, and I've always said that 
you cannot beat lubrication of Penn's oil that's put out by the Penn Company on the market.  I 
don't care who it is.  And if I have to use a light oil, Nye oil is the best oil there is going.  [D:  
Hm]  It will keep your stuff going good
     Something else we have that came out on the market in the last five or six years is amoral.  I 
clean my rods with amoral.  And I'll put two or three coats on them.  The line flies out of them 
rods.  And I even put it on the lines.  But I let it dry good on the lines.  Then I wack it down good
with, with uh, tissues [D:  umhm] so that the finish is not hurt by it.  [D:  Umhm]  I've got very 
good luck with that.  
D:  Now when you go to have your rod maker make you a new rod, what, or if you went for the 
first time, what sort of information would he have to know specifically?  Or what, what would 
you talk about for him to know how to make you the rod that would fit you?
R:  Well first of all you got to find a rod maker that's worth his beans.  [D:  Umhm]  There isn't 
many around.  [D:  Umhm]  I know of, of just a few.  He's got to take in consideration your age, 
your height, your arm strength, what you can do, and if you can handle the length of the rod that 
they want to sell you.  In other words today, years ago they went to these six, seven foot rods.  
Today everybody's talking about a nine and a half, ten, ten and a half foot rod.  Twelve, thirteen 
rod.  I know guys that have rods that are twelve foot.  And they claim that that's, there's nothing 
like it.  All of a sudden the theories have changed around.  But myself, I would go to a rod 
maker.  There's a lot of good ones around, but in this area it's very very hard to find a real good 
rod maker.  Most rod makers want to make it nice a fancy with a lot of winding and a lot of (--)  I
don't want no windings, no threads, no nothing.  [D:  Umhm]  If I could get away with it without 
putting on some [guides?] I think I would.  I've already done it, but I mean uh, you look stupid 
out there with just a tip [D:  chuckles] and a fly rod and no guides.  But it works.  But uh, you got
to find a guy that will not change the, the purpose of that, what that rod was made for.  [D:  
Umhm]  Most rod makers change the purpose.  Because they put all kinds of winding on it.  
They've got to put your name on it.  They got to do this.  They got to make a rainbow.  They got 
to put the american flag down by the handle.  And I mean you don't need that, none of that.  Fish 
don't look at that.  
D:  [Chuckles]  Are there any bamboo makers around here?  
R:  Around Lowell I don't know of any bamboo maker at all.  [D:  Umhm]  The only one I know 
that's doing any bamboo work at all, and not doing a heck of a lot if [Orbus?].  [D:  Umhm]  And 
if you go to Orbus, at one time you could go in there when the old timer was there.  But now the 
old timer's gone, so it's the younger fellows.  And all they do is just build a rod, put it on a rack, 
and you buy it, or you don't.  That's all they care about.  The same thing with Thompson, uh, 
Thomas.  Thomas and Thomas down at Monague.  You go in there now and at one time they 
would take your measurements, your, what you could do with a pair of squeezers in your hand 
for strength, and all that stuff.   And the length of your arms and all that.  And they would make 
you a nice rod that would actually fit you.  [D:  Umhm]  But now you go in there and uh, what's 
on the rack is about what you got to buy.   [D:  Umhm]  It's not uh, I think that artist just you 
know, gone a little bit. [D:  Yeah]  There's a man up in Maine that does a very good job on the 
rod.  But it's the, his name is Hashi, he's in Orino.  Does a nice job.  He's got a nice fly shop.  It's 
in his cellar.  
D:  Is his name Ray?
R:  No.  I don't remember his first.
D:  Yeah, that's where I went to the university up there in Orino. 
R:  Did you? 
D:  Yeah.
R:  But anyway he uh, he can do a good job.  But he's careful and uh, naturally being a Mainer 
he's not in a hurry.  [D:  Umhm]  Where all of the other guys are all in a hurry.  
D:  Yeah.
R:  You know, get it out and get their money.  [D:  Umhm]  That's what they want.  That's why 
I've slowed down in making flies too I guess.  Make them better, make them last.  I've got a 
reputation.  My flies don't come apart.  [D:  Umhm]  So.
D:  Are there many other tiers around here that sell their work?
R:  I don't know of any around Lowell, or there's one place out in the western part of the state 
and a guy by the name of Lefty something.  I don't remember his last name.  He's been doing 
some of it.  But uh, there's not that many.  
D:  There's some guys that tie during the winter.  And then when the good weather comes they 
don't want to tie.  And they go out and they peddle what they've tied.  Make a few dollars and 
that's it.  
R:  Umhm.
D:  But there's no, as far as I know, I don't know of anybody in this general area.  There's one in 
Manchester, but I think he's retired.  And uh, Mr. Beausoleil that was up into Nashua, he's uh, his
eyes are gone.  So he's not doing that anymore.  [D:  Umhm]  He does a little bit, but not too 
much.  But most of the places that I go to, the shops that I go to know what I've been making 
over the years.  And they know that it sells.  And they know (--)  It's just that some of them want 
to get too much money for it.  I don't get that amount of money for them, but they, that's what 
they want to do.  
D:  What kind of prices do you charge for you flies?
R:  Anywheres from, well we'll say in the trout business, we'll say wholesale prices, or the 
customer would have to pay the dealer like we'll say a dollar and a half.  And I have to give so 
much percentage off on that.  And then uh, the classics, well I've done classics up to four and five
hundred dollars.  But it takes me months, sometimes years to do.  Just, you just can't do it in 
short time.  I have some classics right now that I'm working on that I'm trying to pick up the 
materials to do them with.  But I can't find, I would appreciate it, just don't touch them, because 
they fall apart just looking at them.  
D:  Okay, sure.
R:  The uh, [pause].  See, these are gut eyes.  These flies were made in 19, in 1871.  There's the 
jungle clock of 1971 that came off another fly that it was impossible for me to restore to it's 
original place.  [D:  Umhm]  And these flies here come out of a museum in uh, the Tobic River, 
which was in the Tobic River Club.  And you can see the little pieces of the gut eye right here.  
[D:  Umhm]  See them here?  [D:  Umhm]  Well the guy eye rotted out.  So now what I have to 
do is get this think apart, but I have to have the proper material to put back in there, or else I can 
put in the same material that I've taken out.  But what happens with me handling it sometimes, it 
falls apart and I can't, I can't do it.  So I have these two to do.  Probably get around to it in about 
ten years.  But I mean the people that I do this work for understand this.  [D:  Right]  Because 
they know that you just can't, I just can't go out and get it.  [D:  Sure]  Because it's not available.  
[D: Right]  Uh, somebody in England might have a small piece of something, and he'll want 
something that I want.  So we swap by the mail, or something like that.  Or I'll run into 
somebody up in oshgosh New York, or something like that, that has a small thing, you know?  
[D:  Umhm]  And uh, that will help me out on this.  I know what I need, [D:  right] but I have to 
you know.
D:  Well that's very (--)
R:  You can't, you can't very well do the things, the same things that these people did in the 
1800's when they had accessibility to the McCraws and the things.  But I've been lucky.  My 
daughter just bought one.  [D:  Laughs]  So I expect feathers out of that dizzy thing.  Cause all I 
can say is, "hello, hello"!
D:  Well this, this restoration [are very specialized sort of?]
R:  Well I have a lot of, I have a lot of problems with restoration.  This has been done by Charlie 
Shute, which is a good friend of mine.  Does nice work for a guy that hasn't been doing too 
much.  I taught him a few things, but he's taught himself most of the things.  
D:  Now who would you make these plastics for, or do the restoration work for?
R:  Most of the time it's for people that uh, like a museum.  [D:  Umhm]  It's a, it's not, very 
seldom it's for an individual.  Individual people seem to die and then they either throw it away, or
the people that you know, should have kept it, you know.  They don't keep the things, they just 
throw it away, or they put it up in an attic someplace and the moths eat it.  [D:  Right]  Then 
when they see with the thing is all moth eaten, they don't even know what it is, they just throw it 
away.  [D:  Umhm]  So this is what happens a lot.  But I have been doing some work for this.  I'll
show you something that I just got last Sunday.  A friend of mine had went someplace and uh, it 
show you how when you do favors for people how they repay you sometime.  That's only been 
there for a year.  Get that box over there. 
D:  This one right here?
R:  See that box right there?  Yeah, get that box.  In that box, I've fished this river a number of 
times.  But when I was fishing it naturally you didn't, they didn't have this type of doing things.  
This is a picture of the Marguerite Village, where the Marguerite River comes through.  The 
ocean is out here as you can see.  And this is the headwaters, and this is the village.  See it's right 
here.  See where it's marked here?  Marguerite River Valley.  [D:  Oh yeah!]  See it there?  Nova 
Scotia.  Well I, I've fished this, these areas here.  Uh, last time when I was there at first, first time
that I was there this bridge was made out of wood, which now is made out of steel.  [D:  Right]  
And uh, that's something new that I didn't know.  That's uh, but this picture is going to be hung 
up over here.  I'm going to cherish this. 
D:  That's down at Cape Breton way is it?
R:  Yes, well Cape Breton is up higher.  [D:  Yeah]  But this is Nova Scotia.  And the person that 
brought me this was, is one of my ex-fly tier.  Very good fly tier.  I'm proud of his work.  [D: 
That's very nice]  But he don't, he don't do anymore work.  He did a few things and then he got, 
uh, find something else.  [D:  Yeah, yeah]  Like I say, he's rather play with a computer and make 
money.  That's what they do.  [D:  Yeah]
D:  Well what do you like about tying flies?
R:  What do I like about it?
D:  Yeah.
R:  I don't know.  I just seem to enjoy tying flies.  I've always seemed to enjoy tying flies.  I've 
always enjoyed tying flies.  I used to try and invent something with a fly.  For years and years 
and years I worked on different little things, using different little materials.  Something that 
would be just, nobody else would do.  And I, I enjoyed that.  I'd come home from work, read the 
paper, have supper, sit down at the vice.  In those days I didn't have no vice like this.  I just had a 
plain Thompson vice.  And uh, not try to invent something, because it's very very hard to invent 
anything that the British or somebody else hasn't made.  Very very hard.  But not to invent 
something just to see if you can improve on certain ways.  Like uh, I, I, instead of folding 
hackles I manipulate hackles with my fingers, which I think is better to do than to (--)  You fold 
them you put them on , looks real good and everything else, but the way I put them on it's more 
wild.  Make it more like something that's wild!  [D:  Yeah]  It just wants to jump out.  I try to do 
that with a lot of flies.  I've gotten away from them.  I'm sorry to say that I've gotten away from it
in the last three or four years, but every once in awhile I'll sit down and I'll try to do something, 
especially with a salmon.  Like uh, I made some flies for a friend of mine that was having a hard 
time fishing.  You think that everybody has it easy.  He went twenty-one years without catching a
salmon.  But he always went.  [D:  Yeah]  Always went.  Bill Costello lives in Quincy, right 
across the street from Wolleston Beach I guess it is.  And he'd, he'd go every year salmon fishing,
he never hooked a salmon.  I took him trout fishing one day on a boat and I found out why he 
never hooked a salmon.  He's one of these jerkies, [D:  umhm] he jerked so hard he jerked the 
thing right out.  Well anyway, I tried to convince him.  It took me about three or four years to 
convince him that he could not do that.  Then he came over here a few times and got interested in
tying flies.  Well tied just a few simple patterns.  And I made a little deal with him, that he don't 
use nothing but what he tied.  Not what I tied, or whatever he's bought someplace else.  [D:  
Right]  Because you always go someplace, you always buy something.  So he started using his 
own fly.  And glory behold one day after I've kind of convinced him to stop this jerking all the 
time and not to be so more of a rod raiser than rod racker, you know.  He caught a salmon.  Gee 
wiskers!  It wasn't very big.  Ten pounds I guess it was.  But that was the most, that was one of 
the proudest fish he caught.  He wanted to keep it, have it mounted, but he couldn't.  He had to 
put it back.  There was not keeping on that river.  [D:  Uh huh]  So he put it back.  Took pictures 
of it  [D:  Yeah] and drew it out on a piece of cardboard, and kept the fish alive you know.  And 
the fish was all right when he released them.  And uh, he was so proud of that.  He hasn't caught 
one since either.  But he, at least he caught it on his own fly.  Give him something to you know, 
catch, you know.  
D:  Yeah, yeah.  It sounds like a very proud moment.  
R:  Yup.  Some people, I have a woman that comes here probably every three or four years.  She 
don't buy much.  She just buys a few, few of this, few of that.  She's uh, she's not , she's not 
trying to be cheap or anything like that.  She's just, that she feels that her father told her years 
ago stick to six patterns and forget all about the others.  And that's what she does.  When one of 
her patterns goes down a little lower than a dozen, she'll come over here to make sure that she 
has you know, another dozen to back it up, or something like that.  [D:  Umhm] She's caught 
some salmon.  And she's caught some nice salmon.  Her husband, [Cally Wiles], was one of the 
best bomber makers that I've ever known in my life.  His bomber would outfish any bombers that
I've seen people make.  Than I met a fellow on the [Naraguagus?] River that was making 
bombers like a Lee Wolf dry fly.  And this kid was outfishing [Cally Wiles].  So I started making 
bombers like that.  And in this past years, two weeks ago friends of mine went to the [name 
unclear].  And they came back and they all had six bombers a piece, and they came back with 
hardly any bombers, but they caught all of their fish on my bombers tied the Lee Wolf way.  [D:  
Umhm]  But [Cally Wiles?], before he died was, I think was one of the best bomber maker that 
there was around.  He would not make them for anybody.  [D:  Yeah]  He'd give you one once in 
awhile if he felt like it.  But uh, didn't make them to sell or anything.  He had a lamp in his 
trailer.  His trailer and my trailer are both the same thing.  Trailways.  Twenty-one footers.  And 
uh, he'd uh, his wife would always put this lamp on the table, because they slept on the other side
and they'd, they'd open up this side.  And the table, he had made like a little stand for the table on
this side.  When his kids came down, then he'd open up that.  He'd take the table and put it in the 
middle like mine is.  Mine's always been in the same place.  But he had a lamp with a lampshade 
on it.  And his wife would put that on the table.  And he had that lampshade covered with either 
broken bombers, or bent bombers, or hackle bombers that were sick from being used or catching 
fish.  I don't know how many he had on there, [D:  Hm] but he had a lot.  I'm not saying he had 
five hundred, but I'll bet you he had over a hundred.  [D:  Wow]  The man was very very 
successful with a bomber.  Proved it to me I don't know how many times.  
D:  Yup.  Do you collect work of other tiers if you admire it like that?
R:  Oh yes, I do.  I've got a little collection that's put away.  It's in moth balls.  And uh, you can't, 
some of it you just can't handle.  You handle it and the dampness, or the grease, or the I don't 
know what it is from your hands, goofs things up.  So you just don't, you just put it away and you
don't say nothing.  You just leave it there.  You know what I'm saying?  It's for your own, 
it's for your own thing to look at, you know?  It's like I have a Lee Wolf, I can't say the word.  
Commemorative?  How do you say it?
D:  That's right.  Commemorative, yeah. 
R:  Yeah.  Lee Wolf, made by [Follow?], Bamboo.  Two tips, a special handle on it and 
everything else.  There's only, I think there was six made in the world for, for the, for the public 
there was six made.  And I have number five.  And uh, oh I don't know. One of these days I think
I'm going to sell it.  But every time I go to sell it, it's like, it's like everything else.  You get a guy 
that wants a Cadillac, and then you get a guy that wants a Volvo, or [D:  umhm] wants a jeep or 
something you got to find a person that wants that type of rod.  [D:  Sure]  There's a lot of rod 
collectors that have looked at it and they keep telling you, one guy told me very bluntly, Lee 
Wolf is still alive, it ain't worth much.  Uh, you know, things like that you know?  [D:  Uh huh]  
But I have a collection of reels.  I have a collection of hooks.  Now hooks aren't that (--)  I think 
we get better hooks than any in those days even though they were hand made.  But uh, that 
cabinet in the back of you there, is full of hooks.  
D:  All of this?
R:  Yeah, just pull out a draw and you'll see what I'm talking about.
D:  Oh yeah!
R:  And the top is all full of hooks too.  You just pick up the top you know, and it's all full of 
hooks.  It's all hooks.  Then there's only, well I just put in seventy thousand hooks in here.
D:  Seventy thousand?
R:  Just seventy thousand.
D:  Wow!  Different kinds of twine and [rest of comment unclear].
R:  Oh yeah.  All wires and things.  This is my library.  [D:  Uh huh]  I don't uh, I'm not too much
on books.  [D:  Yeah]  I don't like lies.  [D:  Umhm]  I'm not too much on books.  Every book 
you see that I have here is a book that's not very modern.  [D:  Umhm]  It's uh.  Well how can 
you say?  I've sixty-one years old and I'm from the old school.  And I don't like people that put in
a book to sell the book certain things.  I'm not interested into it.  And as you can see, I have tinsel
by the, the uh, spools.  [D:  Right]  And uh, that's how I make my muddlers.  [D:  umhm]  I use 
about a quarter of a spool a year.  Now you can see how big (--)
D:  What's, what's a muddler look like?  Don't you have one in here?
[There's a pause, must be looking for a muddler]
R:  This muddler here is made for fishing bass.  [D:  Oh!]  And it's got a weedless little loop in 
there.  [D:  Umhm]  And it's caught a few fish, because you, you can see this tinsel here is all 
banged up.  And that's a muddler head.  The way that the bass man want it, you know?
D:  What materials do you have in this?
R:  This here has got maribou, silver tinsel, piping, red thread, piece of uh, nylon that's flat nylon 
over the hook so it will be weedless.  And the head here is made with uh, deer hair.  Special deer 
hair that I try to repair.  What I mean by that is I try to keep this hair special.  Certain pieces of 
the deer I won't use.   [D:  Umhm]  Uh, I give it away.  Or kids so they can play with it.  Or use it
in fly tying classes.  I run a few fly tying classes in the winter months here at my house.  [D:  Oh 
really!]  But I haven't had too many customers lately, because these clubs run these classes for 
ten dollars, and I got to get ten dollars a night, or something like that.  [D:  Sure]  So they, they 
run them for ten bucks.  And uh, there are people who flock to them things and they feel that 
that's, hey that's good enough.  [D:  Umhm]  I don't argue with that.  [D:  Yeah]  If that's what the
club wants to do that's their business, but don't have them come over here and tell me what to do.
[D:  Sure]  Do you know what I mean?  [D:  Yeah]  That's how a muddler is made.
D:  Hm.  I've never seen one like that before.
R:  This is what they use here in the river.
D:  Yeah. 
R:  But this is, this is a pattern that I've got to copy for a guy.  [D:  Umhm]  But it's like 
everything else. If I make these things now, he'll uh, he probably won't have, he probably got 
eight or nine of them left.  So what he'll tell me is that he don't uh, he don't need it see.  Let's talk 
about Armoral.  
D:  Armoral, oh yeah.
R:  I use Armoral a lot.  A lot, lot, lots of Armoral.  There's all kinds of tinsel, wires up there and 
stuff.  There's some stuff there for floating.  That's all floating yarns and made out of, some of it's
made out of uh, uh, something you can't sink.  You know, it's like uh, materials that have uh, 
lighter than water.  
D:  Yup.
R:  That's what I use.  And there's, as you can see, the library here is, is uh, in the last six, seven 
years I stopped letting books out.  I never get them back.  [D:  Umhm]  Because they look at it 
and it's been signed by the author and everything else.  Somehow they get your name out of there
and put their name in there and that's it.  I don't do that no more.  I have, I have uh, this is my 
customers things.  A lot of them have gone out of business.  This is the active people that buy all 
the time.
D: These are business cards from different people.
R:  Yeah, different.  You know, they buy all the time.  These things here, these here buy probably 
once a year, maybe sometimes twice a years.  Some of them have gone out of business.  Some of 
them have gone out of, not in, not of business of uh, of selling, of selling uh, how the heck you 
say it?  Fishing gear, [D:  yeah] but going out of the business of having anything to do with the 
fly business.  [D:  Umhm]  A lot of them have uh, because of K Marts and those places that uh, 
that sell uh, sometimes a lot cheaper you know?  You know to me Kittery Training Post isn't 
cheap.  Neither is L.L. Bean.  Neither is Orvis  But Zylas is much cheaper.  [D:  Umhm]  There's 
a lot of people from around this part of New England who would drive for miles just to go to 
Zylas to buy a, well just say a Coonan Rod.  They know they can buy it for $19.95, where it's 
sixty or seventy bucks anyplace else.
D:  Um.  If I put a hundred flies right here, all the same type and it's the type that you make, and 
I put one of yours in there, mix them up, could you pick out yours?
R:  Pick up mine?
D:  Pick out yours from all?
R:  Oh very easy.
D:  What types of things would you look for [unclear]?
R:  Just the head.
D:  The, the head?
R:  Just the head.  I make all my heads the same way.
D:  What's a head?  What's?
R:  The had of the fly.
D:  [Comment unclear]
R:  As you noticed that all of these are all made the same.  [D:  Yup]  All the heads are all made 
the same.  You can take my salmon bag that's over there.  There's probably four or five thousand 
salmon flies in that salmon bag of all kinds.  [D:  Umhm]  Some of them are things that I've 
picked up over the years and just kept them in there.  But I can tell you every one of mine.  My 
heads are always the same.  Always the same.  If I make a mistake a lot of times I throw it away. 
A lot of time I'll just put it aside.  I'll give it to a kid or something like that.  
D:  Yeah.  Is it the particular winding on here, or the direction that it's pointing, or?
R:  No, no.  It's just the way that I make them.  You notice they're all the same.  [D:  Yup]  Can 
you find one there that's different?   [D:  No]  [Both laugh]  Try this one.  [D:  Yup]  They're 
always the same.  That's my trade mark.  Heads and durability.  [D:  Umhm]  A blue fish you 
know will eat up a fly.  One blue fish can destroy a fly completely.  Completely destroy it.  One 
blue fish.  But yet with some of my bigger flies, I tie flies that are about eight inches long that I 
use on the blue fish with the, it's like a muddler head.  It's done with black face sheep hair, [D:  
umhm] which everybody says, black face sheep, it's got to be wool.  It's not wool, it's hair.  It's 
wool after you take the hair out of it the wool is left.  [D:  Umhm]  But the hair is black face 
sheep hair.  It's hair.  [D:  Umhm]  And it gets too (--)  You can get it up to uh, twenty-two inches 
long.  We make these big hair things for fishing tuna.  Teasers they call them.  [D:  Umhm]  And 
they arm one of them.  Joe Catherwood does that up in Tewksbury.  I don't do his work and he 
don't do my work.  I do my stuff and he does his stuff.  [D: Right]  Then we have no problems.  
He a very good friend of mine.  It's a miracle he doesn't call me this morning.  Calls every 
morning practically.  He must have went out for a muffin.  
D:  [Laughs]  How many flies did you say you had in your salmon bag?
R:  Well just pick it up.
D:  God!  Yup.
R:  Open it up if you want to.
D:  Okay.  Now would this be a bag that you would take when you go fishing?
R:  This is a bag I take when I go salmon fishing.
D:  Yup.
R:  I don't take this bag to go trout fishing, [D:  umhm] because it's not for trout.  [D:  Right]  It's 
for salmon.  [D:  Yup]  This is a, it's one of these old [Orvis?] bags.  I think I won it for a dollar at
one time.  I mean this is how it works.  [D:  oh yeah]  See again you see a [fluger] eel.  [D:  
Umhm]  There's the fluger eel and there's the hardy in here.  It's a hardy salmon number one.  I 
keep that inn there.  That's my reel that I'm going to use.  That's my kicker in case something 
happens.  And these, well it's a lot easier to show it to you this way.  These are flies that I'm, that 
I'm going to fish with.  
D:  These are all flies that you made yourself?
R:  Everyone of them in there I made myself.
D:  Yeah.
R:  I got some flies that disappeared out of here.  That son of a gun!  Hm.  No they didn't 
disappear.  I no what I did.  I gave [few word unclear].  Now we have here, these here are what 
they call green machines.  [D:  Umhm]  That was all, there was two dozen of them in there.  
When they left, when this here was left to go to New Brunswick, to the [unclear], they used these
and they caught some fish with it.  Now I caught sixteen and a half pound hen fish on that at the 
Penobscot River up in Brewer.  That caught a fish in the Merrimack River.  That caught a fish at 
the uh, [pause] I can't even think of the name of the river.  Well anyway.  This has caught a fish.  
This is done, this is artificial.  This is a doctor.  And it's all made out of, practically all of it is 
probably all artificial.  But you again, you can see my heads.  See the size of my heads.  [D:  
Right]  And this here caught a fish at the uh, uh, Naraguagus River.  [D:  Umhm]  And this is you
know, in the last two or three years.  As you can see what I have here, then we have uh, these are 
all doubles.  Then I have the singles.  I smoke a lot of cigars, so I have a lot of cigar boxes.  
These are some of the dry flies that are left.  See they used all of the dry flies out of here [D:  
yeah] during that week they were up there.  So there isn't many dry (--)  Naturally with the heat, 
you know, and the thing of the day, you know.  [D:  Umhm]  And this is uh, fly that caught a fish.
And you can see how the fish knocked it all to heck.  And see how the feathers all messed up, 
you know.  [D:  yeah]  Caught a fish with that, right.  So this is how this works see.  [D:  Umhm] 
So there's hardly anymore dry flies left there.  [D:  Umhm]  This box just in this side here there's 
probably two hundred flies.  They're all small things.  And then you have this.  And you have 
doubles and singles.  There's the singles, there's the doubles.  There's the doubles, there's the 
singles.  [D:  Umhm]  So you've got a hundred and forty-four flies there.  So when I told you I 
had some flies in here, [D:  you weren't kidding].  Come out to my car after when my wife comes
back.  I'll show you.  See, these are all doubles, these are all singles.  The reason why sometimes 
these are changes around is the different places that I go to I have to change things around.  Do 
you know what I'm saying?
D:  Why would you choose to fish with a different type of fly.  So you go to a new river, what do 
you do?  
R:  Well, you go to(--)  Before you go to a river you uh, here I'll give you a salmon muddler. You 
were looking for one. 
D:  Oh thank you.
R:  Before you go to a river you find out what the color of the river is.  You have rivers that are 
red.  You have rivers that are yellow.  You have rivers that are black.  You have rivers that just at 
the uh, what do you call it?  What works in them is, the best is we'll say you go to this one river 
that uh, peacaw curl works the best like at Penobscot.  [D:  Umhm]  Peacaw curl and a little bit 
of orange.  A little bit of yellow, a little bit of green works certain days at the uh, at the uh, 
different rivers.  But you also have rivers that got to be black.  
D:  You mean that's the color of the water, or?  [R:  No, no]  That's just the (--)
R:  That's the color of the flies that the fish will hit.  [D:  Uh huh]  So you have to uh (--)  What 
the hell is going on here.  There's uh you know, different things that uh, different colors you got 
to have.  You just can't uh (--)  See, you got a salmon carrier.  [D:  Yup]  These are all hand made 
by some friends of mine up in Bangor, Maine, Brewer, Maine.  And uh, you go to these different 
rivers, you've, you've got to know what color is going to take.  Supposing you go to uh, 
[Merramachi?].  Well Black Bear, Green Butt, Conrad.  Ted Williams swears by Conrad.  See 
what it says there?  "To Ray, these are nice, thanks."  Ted Williams.  
D:  Very nice.  
R:  See, he ordered some Conrads.  [D:  Umhm]  He didn't order them.  [D:  Umhm]  It's the 
other guy that ordered them.  The bread man there with him on TV, Bud Levitt.
D:  Oh, is he still fishing with Ted Williams?  [R:  Oh]  [Laughs]
R:  I don't know how the hell they can get along with each other.  They're always at each other's 
throat.  But anyway they, they have a lot of arguments, you know?  [D:  Yeah huh]  Yeah, I have 
uh, what the hell else do I have here.  Oh I have a lot of different things.  I tied flies for Johnny 
[Buzik?].  I just did some flies.  I had a hard time to get paid by from Buddy Larousseau, [D:  
umhm] from the Red Sox there?  [D:  Right]  I had a hard time getting Buddy Larou.  I had a 
hard time getting paid from him.  I finally had to go down to the ring down there, that skating 
ring that he owns there.  That Nautilis thing there?  [D: Oh yeah]  I finally had to go down there 
and see his agent.  And this is uh, Mr. Fletcher's salmon fly.  All of these things all mean 
something you know?  [D:  Yup]  This is Pete's Fly Shop.  Pete uh, every year he orders these 
two flies.  It's a red and white and a micky [vin?].  [D:  Umhm]  Tandems.  But that's all he sells! 
[D:  Umhm]  He's got all of the others, but he never sells too many of them.  [D:  Umhm]  You 
know?  This is uh, is it Charlie Olcott?  Yeah, that's Charlie Olcott.  He just came back from 
England.  And he learned how to ties flies, spent two years over there to learn how to tie flies 
from the English people.  [D:  Umhm]  Not from uh, just tiers, I'm talking about big name 
professional people.  [D:  Umhm] Like he went, I think he stayed with Meghan Boyd five 
months.  Him and Boyd, Meghan Boyd and this other guy by the name of Boyd that lives up in 
Maine.  I think they stayed with her in that area, or, or with her.  I don't know how the heck it 
worked.  [D:  Umhm]  I never asked because I figured it was none of my business.  But I know 
they stayed there like five months or something and tied with Meghan Boyd.  I have a fly right 
there by Meghan Boyd.  One of them.  See where it says Bill's flies there?  [D:  Right]  Well 
that's one of them Meghan Boyd's patterns.  [D:  Oh yeah]  And that's a Marguerite.  That's, that's
stuff, work that I did for the Marguerite Museum about I don't know, eight nine years ago.  19 I 
don't know.  That's a long time ago.   [D:  Hm]  Some of the pictures of the fish, you know, [D:  
Umhm] you don't want to see that anyway.  Make you sick pal.  [Laughs]  Throw that back over 
there will you please?
     But I mean this is what I've been doing over the years and everybody thinks that you don't do 
nothing, you know?
D:  Well anyone would just have to walk in here and see that there's um, it represents hours and 
hours and hundreds of hours of work just to set up your shop like this.  This certainly takes up all
of your time I'm sure.  
R:  A lot of people don't think so.  [D:  Hm]  They accuse you of all kinds of things.  You know a 
few weeks ago you wouldn't believe this.  We had a little gathering over my brother's next door.  
One of the boys that was over there just came out of the service accused me of using a machine 
to tie flies.  [D:  Hm]  He said oh you can't do this work.  Because I showed him, he wanted to 
see what I had just finished, and I showed it to him.  He says you can't, can't do that work like 
that.  An impossibility.  You have to have a machine.  I never used a machine in my life.  I don't 
even know of a machine that's made.  I know one that was sent here one time, but I put it back in 
a box and sent it back to California because it wouldn't work.  [D:  Umhm]  But I'm just saying 
that uh, I don't know of any machines.  I don't know of any tiers that tie by machine.  [D:  
Umhm]  I know one woman does buck tails, tubble hook buck tails with a machine.  Her 
husband made that machine.  There's no commercial machine that you can buy.  [D:  Right]  So 
whatever you see that's done by a fly tier, it's all a work of art.  You got to learn how to draw.  
You got to learn how to uh, color.  I make, I make uh, bigger bellies that you put them in the 
water, besides you can go into a bait shop and they got shiners in the bait shop, and I'll take and 
put them down there.  And you look at them, you know, number of inches away, number of [D:  
umhm] like a foot or so, a foot and a half away, and you going to have a hard time telling which 
is which.  But you probably would know if you, you just like focus your eyes on it quick.  But a 
fish don't see it that much.  [D:  Right]  All he does is just a suggestive thing that went by his 
vision and he's going to nail it.  [D:  Umhm]  So that's why there's a lot of these imitation 
patterns that are just attractor, work.  [D:  Umhm]  It's not the idea that it's a perfect imitation.  I 
have a friend of mine, like I told you this Mr. Catherwood does all kinds of beautiful work.  He 
uh (--)  Hey, I've been looking for that.  No, that ain't the one.  Mr. Catherwood does a lot of 
work, a lot of different types of work.  But uh, see there's a fly that's uh, eight inches long.  
Here's another one.  Wait a minute, excuse me.  They all have names.  [D: Yeah]  And uh, see, 
like this is a squid.  [D:  Oh yeah!]  Squid type.  [D:  Right]  See?  
D:  Yeah.  Oh!  Where does this man live.
R:  Tewksbury.
D:  Yeah.  
R:  He won't talk to you unless you pay him about a thousand bucks.  [D:  Laughs]  Well what 
the hell.  He's not like some people.
D:  Yeah.  Boy those are really different to my eye. 
R:  Trumpet fish.  Instead of people call them needle fish, a trumpet fish.  [D:  Yeah, well]  They 
had some trumpet fish down the Cape when my son was down there one time.  And boy we used 
to go down there and watch them.  I used to go down and watch them.  You know this is, this is a
stupid looking thing.  Don't even look like a shrimp and that's still a shrimp pattern.  You know 
what I mean?  There's the herring pattern.
D:  Yup.  So these are all salt water?
R:  Salt water and fresh water both.  [D:  Yeah]  You can use them in great lakes.  You can use 
them anyplace you want.  [D:  Umhm] There's nothing, no such a thing as using a fly for just a 
certain purpose unless that's what you want to do.
D:  Right, right.  
R:  Nobody ever said that you uh, it's like that shrimp right there.  Does that look like a shrimp?  
It's designed like a shrimp.  [D:  Yeah]  Does it look like a shrimp?  You know what I'm saying?
[D:  Yup]  The colors aren't there like a shrimp.  You probably remember shrimp when they're 
cooked.  They're red.  You, there in the side of the water there, they're green.  [D:  Umhm]  See, 
now here's a red one.  This one here got cooked.  Do you understand?  
D:  Sure.
R:  They catch fish!
D:  Yeah.
R:  Suggestive.
D:  Yeah.
R:  Now here's a green one, or brown one.
D:  Yeah.
R:  See that's the real thing in the water.  You understand what I'm saying?
D:  Sure.
R:  Look at the Mirabou.  Look at the work in that.  [D:  Wow]  Look at the work on this thing, 
on the Elva.  [D:  Gee!]  That's an Elva.  [D:  Yeah]  Most people don't even know what Elvas 
are, you know?  [D: Umhm]  Marinettes.  Whoever heard of Marinettes?  But they're in the 
water.  [D:  Umhm]  People will look at it and they'll say, oh, it's a Marinette?  Yeah, Marinette.  
People will say, well what's Marinette?  [D:  Laughs]  You know?  And this here is a, well this is 
a nice sixty-four pound striper, [D: wow] caught by Randy, [D:  Umhm] Randy Pike.  That's 
mounted on a wall of his house.  [D:  Oh yeah]  Sixty-two pounds, fourteen ounces.  And this 
here is a thing that I did for the uh, game wardens up in Maine.  This is a tree toad with it's fur 
coat on.  [D:  Laughs]  I took two big, big eyes you know, from the taxidermist.  [D:  yeah, right] 
And this is a, the body of a squirrel.  [D: Umhm]  Grey Squirrel.  And this here is a tail of a 
skunk.  [D:  Laughing]  And I made, I made like wire you know, a little wire forming thing [D:  
yeah] you know?  And we put it up.  I made three of them.  They still got them.  They still go 
around with them in their, in their boots in different sportsman show with the tree toad that's got 
it's fur coat on.  [D:  Laughing]  They say it, they say it squeaks.  [D:  Laughs]  Oh we do a lot of 
things that uh, uh we do a lot of things that we're not suppose to do either I suppose.  [D:  
Laughing]  What can you do you know?
D:  Well I've got to shut this down Ray, [R:  go ahead] because that's about [unclear] tape here.  
[R:  Are you all out?]  Yeah.  
R:  Shut it off.
D:  Was there anything else you wanted to add before we (--)  [R:  No]  Anything I haven't asked 
you?
R:  Stop putting up the Lamprey Eels in the Merrimack.
D:  Okay, I'll tell anyone that has any authority over it.  Sure. 
R:  That's bad.  I've seen them sucking on fish over here and sucking on rocks and everything 
else.  You know, right, stuck right to them you know?  [D:  Umhm]  We have a lot of guys around
here that went around with a blow, I mean a blow gun, uh, a bow and arrow and they killed an 
awful lot of them up in, up here where they're building now.  Where you can't get, you can't get 
to it you know?  [D:  Umhm]  Because the, they won't let you in there you know?  [D: Oh yeah]  
It's all under security.  That's for the, the water treatment plant uh, you know, for the sewerage.  
[D:  Umhm]  What they should have done, put that in first I think and then put in the, put in the 
ladder.  Now this.  But they say it don't matter now because there's not going to be many fish 
going to be using the ladder in the fall.
