FIVE POUND PIG. 
Respectfully dedicated to Jas. D. Roome. 
Music by Geo. F. Moore. 
Words by J. W. White. 
Sung with great success by Pettit & White. 
I 
went up to Jackson's house, he met nie at the door. 
Says he now look here Mister Mann, you needn't come here 
no more, 
Says I, now Mister Jackson, I 
do not care a 
tig. 
I 
just come down to try and sell, p 
little five pound pig. 
CHORUS. 
Pass the bottle all around, 
Pass the bottle all around, 
Pass the bottle all around, 
For the pig only weighed five pounds, 
I 
don't think there's any body hurt, 
I 
don't think there's any body cut, 
I 
don't think there's any body hurt, 
For the pig only weighed five pounds. 
I 
sell my meat the whole day long, and when at night I'm done. 
I 
dress myself all in my best, and then go out for fun. 
The white folks shake their heads at me, and say I'm mighty 
big, 
But I 
tell them that it came from, that little five pound pig. 
CHORUS. 
Pass the bottle all around, etc.

GET THEE GONE GIRL. 
Written by C. R. Dockstader, for and sung by J. D. Roome. 
As I 
was a 
reading the paper last night, 
I 
saw there a 
story that I 
will recite, 
Its about a 
young damsel got stuck on a 
clerk, 
She bothered him daily while he was at work 
Oh, this gal she would watch him and on him keep an eye, 
She swore she would have him or with him she'd die, 
When she went to embrace him he'd yelp loud and strong. 
Get thee gone girl, get thee gone girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee gone. 
Oh, she tortured him hourly and stuck just like glue, 
He wasted away and his clothes he fell through. 
He rented a 
barnyard and slept in the shed, 
And this girl she hung till his reason had fled, 
Now she crawled through a 
knot hole and roost by his side 
With a 
hunk of blue ribbon his ankles she tied, 
When he awoke from his slumbers like a 
hero did say, 
Get thee away girl, get thee away girl, 
But the girl wouldn't get thee away. 
Oh, she followed him around and one evening he died, 
He opened his mug and be let his breath slide, 
In an alley way they have laid him to take his last sleep, 
Where the tom eats do fight and the bull dogs do eat, 
Oh, she dressed herself up in a 
new sunday coat, 
With some white wash his age on a 
shovel she wrote, 
Now she gets boiling full and the boys all do shout, 
Get thee out girl, get thee out girl, 
But the girl don't get thee out, 
THE COONS FROM ALABAMA. 
Written by S. S. Pettit and sung with great success by 
white. 
-We are two coons raised from the ground, 
As good and sound as can be found. 
We are always sure to be around, 
The sights all for to see, 
We're from the sunny southern soutn, 
You see we're full of life, 
What one can't do the other can, 
betwesn us there's no strife. 
CHORUS. 
Pettit 1 
We are gay and festive as you can plainly see, 
Always full of fun so happy light and free, 
We'll do the best we can no matter where we be, 
We're the coons from Alabama. 
(Repeat.) 
We have to work out all the day, 
The people say we are too gay, 
But when from work we get away, 
You bet we can't keep still, 
So after working the whole long day, 
They keep us on till dark, 
That's the time we have our fun, 
For we go out on a 
lark. 
CHORUS. 
We arc gay and festive as you can plainly see, 
Always full of fun so happy light and free, 
We'll do the best we can no matter where we be, 
We're the =Ins from Alabama, 
(Repeat.) 
THE GOLDEN SLIPPERS. 
Music by Harry Bland.

Sung by Pettit 4E 
Oh I

And, ah, who do I

There's a

big, a 
nigger wench, 
A

And she's got them golden slippers, 
And she's got them in her hand, 
And she say's she's going to wear them 
Before she reach that Canaan'S' land. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's oh them golden slippers, 
Then it's ah them golden slippers. 
Golden slippers I'm going for to weir, 
And I 
wear them till I

(Repeat.) 
Some people go to church, 
For to sing and to pray, 
But none of them, 
Got the Christian way, 
Some people go tb chttrch, 
For to sing and tO talk, 
And none of them, 
Got the Christian walk. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's oh theft' golden slippers, 
Then it's ah them golden slippers,

And I

Words and Music by Pettit & Whito. 
Oh here we are two pals, 
And we love two yaller gals. 
We 
first met at the husking of the corn, 
And we promised one and all, 
That we'd go down to the ball, 
And that's what we are here for now, 
As sure as you are born. 
CHORUS. 
Then it's oh, my, wont we have a 
time there, 
Hands around, s;:ing your partner, sashay, balance all, 
Oh, my, wont we cut a 
shine there, 
With Nancy Snow, and Dinah Crow, down at the husking 
It isn't every day, 
That we have it holiday, 
We have to labor hard upon the farm, 
So while we have a 
chance, 
We'll amuse you with a 
dance. 
And white folks tell us that in it, 
Youcan not find no harm. 
CHOR Us, 
Then its oh, my, wont we have a 
time there, 
Hands around, swing your partner, sashay, balance all, 
Oh, my, wont we cut a 
shine there, 
With Nancy Snow, and Dinah Crow, down at the husking 
ball. 
Written by Geo. F. Moore for Pettit k 
White. 
I 
got a 
girl in New Orleans, 
Tell us what's her name, 
She was raised on corn and beans, 
Tell us what's her name, 
Rebecca Lawton don't like her, 
Tell us what's her name, 
With jealousy she dasn't stir, 
Tell us what's her name. 
CHORUS. 
Why it's Mary Matil Ma Tilda, 
Mary Matilda that's her name, 
Shout on it's Mary Matil Ma Tilda, 
Mary Matilda that's her name. - 
I 
like this girl indeed I 
do, 
' Tell us what's her name, 
Her lips am like the morning dew, 
Tell us what's her name, 
She's got a 
bile upon her nose, 
Tell us what's her name, 
If ever it busts Lord help her clothes, 
Tell us what's her name. 
CHORUS. 
Why it's Mary Matil Ma Tilda, 
Mary Matilda that's her name, 
Shout on it's Mary Matil Ma Tilda, 
Mary Matilda that's her name. 
THE JOHNSON GUARDS. 
Written and sung by Pettit & White. 
Here we are two colored crows, 
Just as gay as gay can be, 
We are always full of fun, 
Watch our movements you will see, 
We can dance and we can sing, 
We can do most any thing, 
We'll do our best and that we wil' , 
For the Johnson Guards are going to drill, 
CHORUS. 
Oh, my, ain't we happy, 
Just as happy as can be, 
Two colored soldiers here we stand, 
Jim Johnson and Pete Duryea, 
(Repeat.) 
You ought to see us on parade, 
Walking up and down the green. 
The ladies saywe'rejust the thing, 
Two better soldiers ne'er was seen, 
In marching and drilling we can't be beat, 
You'll always find us on our feet, 
We, 
il do our best and that we will, 
For the Johnson Guards are going to drill. 
Cuottus.

( 
Repeat.) 
Written by Jas. D. Ronnie. 
Surly by Pettit & White. 
In pig's eye holler there lived a 
man. 
Who money had a 
plenty. 
His beautiful daughter Mehitable Jane. 
Was ag-i-ed only twenty, 
Now there was a 
young man in lov* 
vili her. 
Whose name was Ike Zachariab. 
But the old man threatened if she spoke to Ike, 
She thould face his dreadful ire. 
Now Mehitable Jane wrote a 
letter to Ike, 
For to meet her in the wood shed. 
So he hired a 
squire and at midnight went, 
For to get mar-ri-ed, 
But Mehitable's old man did get wind, 
Of the whole affair, 
So he armed himself with a 
big stuffed club, 
And he captured the lively pair. 
Sow Ike and the squire in wild despair, 
Fled to parts unknown, 
Now Ike was found shot with a 
big sausage, 
And the squire stabbed with a 
bone. 
Next day the old man went to ,Nlehitable's room, 
But he found her there stone dead, 
The heart broken had cut her throat, 
With a 
loaf of big dutch bread. 
Then anguish filled the old man's heart, 
And sorrow pierced his brain, 
So he drowned himself in a 
dry fish pond 
And suffered most horrible pain. 
And now I have told you the whole of the tale, 
No more can you desire, 
That's the end of the old man and the squire, 
Jane and Ike Zachariah. 
ALABAZAM. 
Sung by Pettit & White. 
I 
almost cried my eyes out, , 
My clothes,are getting thinner, 
All through .a red head, bald head girl, 
I 
tried my best to win her, 
I 
treated her to oyster stews, 
And,ice cream every day, 
Put when from me she got my stamps, 
Why then she skipped away. 
etwnes. 
She's my darling•Michigander, she's my alabaster rose. 
Her ears so long, her breath so strong. 
She wears a 
Roman nose, 
She juggles the hash, she's on the mash, 
Most everywhere she goes. 
She's my Kalimazanda, Zauda, Kalimazanda, Alabazam• 
The fellow she promised her heart to. 
Was an artist in his line, 
N.
as by birth a 
snatcher of dogs, 
got rich in summer time, 
He made her a 
present of a 
poodle dog, 
Her whole heart to ensnare, 
And a 
bottle of bald headed butter pomade. 
To grease her nice red hair. 
Cum:us. 
She's my darling Michigander, she's my alabaster rose, 
her ears so long her breath so strong, 
She wears aTtoman nose, 
She juggles Ithe hash, she's on the mash. 
Most every where she goes, 
She's my Kalimazanda, Zanda, Ralinlazanda, Alabazam, 
GOT IT ON THE BRAIN. 
Sung by Pettit 
White. 
We'll try and sing you a 
song that's new, 
And we'll try to hoop it up, 
It never was sung but we'll sing it to you, 
And that's what's the matter with the pup, 
Well sing to you of various folks, 
Of some that drinks, of some that smokes, 
Of some that are crazy, of some that are sane, 
And we'll sing of sonic that have got it on the brain. 
CHORUS. 
Hold your horses, and take a 
back seat, 
And we will try to make you smile 
We'll hoop you up a 
dish by the express train, 
For they all have got it on the brain. 
There's the dandy with his big mustache, 
Oh don't he strut and jitit on style, 
He thinks every lady in the town he can mash. 
And tries mighty hard to get a 
smtle, 
lie drives fast horses and gallants around, 
But all the ladies know him to be the biggest fool in town, 
With his patent leather boots and brass headed Cane, 
You can bet your bottom dollar he has got it on the brain. 
Hold your horses etc. 
It's a 
scandalous fact that a 
scandal is out, 
In Brooklyn city it's Tilton about, 
It's a 
getting red hot up to Moulton heat, 
And its put Plymouth rock very shaky on it's feet. 
Old Ben Butler said he wished the thing was dead, 
People over there are standing on their head, 
If you want to be known and get up your-name, 
Move to Brooklyn and get a 
scandal on the brain. 
Hold your horses etc. 
Sung by Pettit & White. 
My troubles I'll try to explain, 
Can I 
borrow your ear for awhile, 
I'm dejected and my heart,s filled with woe, 
I 
can scarce raise a 
second hand smile, 
I 
expect I'm perplexed and I'm vexed, 
And I 
know I'll soon cash in my checks, 
For I've sighed and I've cried, I've snored and I've lied, 
For a 
maiden called Julia ,T. Becks. 
She wore swallow tail gloves on her feet, 
And her tin trumpet voice it was sweet, 
She had navy blue ears, she cried Indian tears, 
And she wore a 
tan yard on her feet, 
She had eyes like a 
German brass band, 
She carried a 
farm in each hand, 
With a 
lump in her throat she could sing like a 
goat. 
And her clothes filled a 
small oyster car 
I 
am thin I 
am haggard and pale, 
If I 
catch her I'll cause her to quail, 
Oh I'm out of my head I 
wish I 
was dead, 
0 I 
wish I 
was boss of some jail, 
For the last time I 
met this lair maid, 
We had a 
most violent row, 
She stood seven feet six with an armful of bricks, 
And she wore a 
war cloud on her brow. 
Sung by Pettit et White with tremendous success. 
;miler around me brave and bold, 
If my song- is new it can't be old, 
And if it's short it can't be long, 
And as it's right it can't be wrong, 
And as it's small it can't be tall, 
Of course there's more so that ain't all. 
Once there lived a 
colored man, 
And when he walked he never ran, 
When he was born his life be!rati, 
And Mary's lamb it was a 
ram, 
fie never drinks so he don't get drunk, 
And he has no •clothes so he don't need a 
valise. 
Now when I'm happy 1 
never fret, 
Tf your eyes are dry they can't be wet, 
For when you laugh you doesn't cry, 
If that's the truth it ain't a 
lie, 
When I 
am wrong I'm never right, 
I'll sing you some more to- morrow evening.

fine, nothing to do and every Sunday out. 
Larry is our 
milkman and has fine prospects before him and to help 
him along I 
waters his milk every morning, to show that 
he gives good measure. 
(Goes about the room pushing chairs and ehoving the table). 
Yes, and he says some finellaythey might be a

Tend to your mistresss first and I'll wait till you 
come back. 
Alt, that Maria is the sweetest girl in the 
whole world. 
(Puts milk can on table and comes prirard). 
And I 
think I

Limerick to have the love of that sweet girl. 
(Snaps. his whip and walks about admiring the furniture, 
etc., which is in great (lisorder). 
And just see What a 
tidy housekeeper she is to be sure.. 
Everything in beautiful order, and there's the boiling tea 
kettle on the fire. 
It's blowing and pulliing like a 
locomo-

tive and ready to bust. 
Ah, I'm afraid Maria has too much 
work here and she can't tend to it all, and I've got a 
nice 
place for her, where there is nothing to do and every Sun-
.day out. 
There's nobody can appreciate the worth 3f 
that girl hut myself, and soon as Widow geCauley's

pistOl 81we 
heard, he falls over crying out:) 
Pm stabbed! 
I'm stabbed!

SONG. 
MY SUNDAY OUT . 
AIR.—" Big Sun Flower." 
I 
drudge and toil all thro' the week, 
Among the kitchen ware, 
Tho' missus scolds each word she speaks, 
For that I 
doesn't care, 
I 
sweeps the rooms and toss the beds 
And beats them all about, 
But takes things easy when I'm done, 
And have my Sunday out. 
CHORUS. 
Then I 
feel just as happy as a 
big cock robin, 
Rocking and singing on the treeses, 
For when I 
have my Sunday out, 
I 
do just as I 
pleases. 
(Dance). 
All dressed up in my Sunday best, 
The milkman then I 
meets, 
And arm in arm we promenade 
All through the nobby streets, 
He whispers words of love to me 
As sweet as sugar paste, 
And in the pail: we set and chat, 
His arm around my waist! 
Chorus.—Then I 
feel just as happy, etc, 
CACKLE, CACKLE, CACKLE 
MY name is Peter Simple, and I

ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH, 
DASHING through the snow, 
In a 
one-horse open sleigh, 
O'er the hills we go, 
Laughing all the way, 
Bells on bob-tail ring, 
Making spirits bright: 
Oh, what sport to ride, and sing 
A 
sleighing song to-night. 
Jingle, bells, jingle, bells, jingle all the way. 
Oh, wl fit joy it is to ride in a 
one-horse open sleigh. 
(Repeat.) 
The other day I 
thought 
That I 
would take a 
ride, 
I 
found myself soon seated, 
With Fanny by my side. 
The sleigh bells they did jingle, 
The horse did snort and blow, 
And off we started sleighing. 
Upon the crested snow. 
We started soon for home, 
A-singing that same old song. 
Oh! don't you see them little bays 
A-trotting right along? 
They gayly prance and skip, 
And know it's all right, 
For they have got all through their work, 
And bound for home to- night.

THE old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And these hands refuse to do the daily toil; 
I 
never dream'd ' twould come to this, or that I'd be in need, 
After years of service in Carlina soil. 
My limbs are bending 'neath their weight, my hair is white as 
snow, 
And I 
cannot see the gentle summer sky ; 
My feet grow weary day by day, my step is weak and slow, 
And I'm gwine to leave my comrades by and by.

The old man ain't himself no mo', lie's nearly gone to seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The old man ain't himself no mo', he's nearly gone to seed, 
And his hands refuse to do the daily toil. 
The good old days when I 
was young have flitted like a 
dream, 
And I 
hardly knew that I 
was growing old; 
I 
never stopped to think how these poor 
arms of 
mine 
would seem, 
If the poor old man was left out in the cold. • 
But now I 
know the feeling well, it almost breaks my heart 
For to think that I 
must die away from home. 
Oh, if I 
could be young again, to- morrow I 
would start, 
And to old Carlina'S shores l'd quickly roam. 
The old man ain't himself, etc. 
I 
long to see the cotton fields, the tall Palmetto trees, 
And to hear the happy darkies shout and sing; 
I 
never shall forget the good, the old plantation glees, 
Or the way we used to make the banjo ring; 
But all is nearly over now, the trumpet soon will sound. 
Then I'll Live to cross the river over there; 
And when I 
set may aching feet upon the sacred ground, 
I hall know no mo' about this worldly care.

Written by FRANK DUMONT, and sung by HARRY -W OODSON, 
with great success at Tony Pastor's. 
Far away in the South. among the codon fields, 
is the place I 
ever long to see. 
Oh ! the dear sunny clime where I 
was bred and born, 
And the memory is ever dear to me; 
Oh! the mocking bird's singing in the trees close by, 
While far from the spot I 
now roam, 
In this wide, weary world wherever I 
may go, 
There is no place like the dear old home. 
CHORUS. 
Then give me a 
home in the dear old South, 
For fondly I 
love it still ; 
Then I 
sigh night and day, I 
long to sec again 
Is that old log cabin on the hill. 
Oh ! the ones I 
love is sleeping in the ground, 
When I 
am passing so fast away, 
And my heart grows so sad I 
long to return, 
Oh ! the old man ain't what he used to be ; 
And the magnolias bloom around the cabin door, 
'Tis then I 
turn with a 
sigh, 
Oh I 
I 
will go back again, back to them cotton fields, 
In that old cabin home there let me die.

I LIVE in a 
bang-up boarding house, 
Not very far away. 
Make no mistakes we're a

We have three squares a

And when we get home late at night, 
We never miss a

We skirmish around for what is left. 
And make the pantry sick.

When the big bell rings for hash,

Tobias, with the pigeon toes, 
Tabitha Knowall, a

With curls, and a

There's Mr. Fresh, he talks you to death, 
And Smith as quiet as a 
mouse. 
Our appetites are photographed, 
Up at our boarding house. 
Don't the boarders, cte, 
There's a 
pale young man in the attic room. 
His hair hangs down in curls, 
He writes nice poetry on the walls, 
He's a 
tough man with the girls. 
Our boarding mistress, bless her heart, , 
She says I

No use was it kicking, for on she went licking, 
With spank! spank! spank!

Oft she would turn me, as if for a

Over her knee, over her knee, 
Turn me again and again; 
It was spank! spank! spank! 
In vain was my crying, she kept applying, 
The spank! spank! spank!

terrible pain. 
Then it's over her knee, SEe.. 
When I 
was free—down from her knee, 
Naughty again I 
was certain to be. 
Then she took me back on her knee, 
Acting the same as before; 
It was spank! spank! spank!

Then out love flies, his wings are fleet,

THAT YOUNG MAN ACROSS THE WAY, 
SONG AND CHORUS. 
Words by Miss KATIE BELLE W ICHMANN. 
Music by E. MACK 
Well, I 
wonder what's the meaning, 
Always looking over here, 
When I'm at the parlor window, 
He is sure then to appear; 
Every evening as I 
sit there, 
Just before the close of day, 
There he is, with roguish glances, 
Watching me across the way. 
CHORUS. 
So let him stare, I 
do not care, 
I 
shall not go away; 
Young men who live across the street, 
Must look across the way. 
He has brown hair, dark and waving, 
And Ifs eyes, I 
think, are gray, 
But I 
know, whate'er their color, 
Often do they look this way, 
And one tender twilight evening, 
I'm quite sure that he did this— 
Just before I 
left the window. 
Unto me he threw a 
kiss. 
So let him stare, etc. 
From the other side, one evening, 
To our door he found his way, 
After that, 'twas very often 
That he came across the way; 
And while sitting by our window, 
There was much he made me say, 
And, 'mong other things, I 
promised 
That I'd live across the way. 
So let him stare, etc. 
IT 
was the other evening, as I 
sat at home, 
Musing where I'd go, when if I 
went to roam; 
All at once it struck me, I 
began to think, 
That I'd pass the evening at the skating rink; 
So away I 
started with my skates in hand, 
There I 
found the boys and girls the happiest M the land, 
And how my heart did flutter when I 
saw as neat as a 
pin) 
My little black-eyed charmer skating at the rink. 
CHORUS. 
On the rink a 
skating in the bright moonlight, 
By your side your sweetheart 'tis my heart's delight 
And of all the pleasures in this world I 
think, 
There is nothing suits me better than the rink. 
Oh! isn't it delightful skating on the ice, 
But when you fall and crack your head it isn't then so nice; 
And to have your sweetheart leave you fa} behind, 
Scoot ofl with- another chap that don't suit my mind, 
I 
know this to my sorrow, for I 
tried it once, 
And I 
had to stand it like a 
simple dunce, 
But my mind is made up, if this game is tried, 
That forever after this I 
think I'll let her slide. 
On the Rink, &e.

arm together gracefully we glide, 
O'er the glassy flooring closely side by side 
And with no one looking it doesn't come amiss, 
To throw your arm around her and to steal a 
kiss, 
And to have her tell you she'll give you the sack, 
If you don't immeniately take and put it back, 
And you then obey her once or twice or thrice, 
Oh, bless me, aint it pleasant skating on the ice.

LIFE is full of toil and trouble ; 
Care and sorrow hover near; 
Gloomy thoughts by day oppress us, 
All our nights are pass'd in fear. 
Still a 
brighter day is coming, 
But tow'rd earth our heads are bow'd, 
And we cannot see the sunlight, 
Hid, just now, behind a

Ne'er despair, tho' life seem weary, 
All the bitter cup must quaff ; 
Weeping will not mend the matter, 
Better far at care to laugh. 
Life's a 
farce in which your acting. 
Should be careless, gay and proud, 
Like to his who sees the sunlight, 
E'en tho' hid behind a

Laugh at fate, etc. 
Laugh with scorn an

defiance 
To the ills that life can bring ; 
Trouble flees when met undaunted, 
Grief is robbed of half its sting. 
Firmly stand, erect and manly, 
Bend not like the pliant crowd, 
Light will beain In time upon you, 
Altho' now hid behind a

ORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE. 
By COTTON & BIRDUE. 
When we were together, in that sunny land, 
Where all's Eternal Spring, 
We'd wander through the cotton fields, 
And hear the Jay- bird sing. 
We'd hunt the Old Raccoon, 
By the glimmer of the Moon, 
Whene'er we had a 
chance. 
At evening, when the boys were on the green„ 
We'd join them in the festive dance! 
CHORUS. 
Gay and smiling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have, 
Down in that sunny land! 
When we were a 
courting Poll and Bess, 
Down in that sunny land; 
We'd take them rowing on the Lake, 
Or strolling on the strand; 
We'd take the old Banjo, 
And together we would go 
And stay until the break of day! 
We wish those happy, happy days 
Had never passed away. 
CHORUS. 
Gay and smiling! 
Hours beguiling! 
Oh, give us back the home we used to have,

The subject to-night of my song is love, 
Something quite heavy to bear; 
When that being you love to you prover, untrue, 
For none else in the world do you care. 
The lady I 
love is an angel divine, 
And with her my life I 
would share: 
But whene'er I 
go to her house her to see, 
There is always somebody there. 
SPOKEN.—I explained the matter to her the other evening, 
and when I 
had finished, she looked into my face this way, and 
said, that's nothing— 
CB-onus. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you. 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you, 
A 
sofa, a 
stool, or a 
chair. 
I 
went to her house one evening last week, 
You may easily judge my surprise; 
I 
was just going to enter the hallway when 
I 
met that which opened my eyes. 
For there stood a 
man both tall and stout, 
Who said wItat do you wish here ? 
Grabbed me by the neck, threw me out on the walk, 
t. And the last words I 
could hear while there was--
CHORUS. 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
No matter how many are there; 
There's always a 
seat in the gutter for you, 
When you come around here have a 
care. 
Now the young men I 
go with all gave me the laugh, 
My troubles to them I 
have told; 
They say I 
am foolish to speak to her, 
Because I've been so often sold. 
No matter how often I 
have or may be, 
My love I 
shall never expel, 
I'll follow her, yes, both day and night, 
And my burdensome tale I 
will tell. 
SPOKEN.—Yes; I 
shall haunt her day and night if its only to 
hear her say— 
Cuont:s. 
There's always a 
seat in the parlor for you,

Everybody's fast and furious, 
Nothing's like it use to was, 
Seems to MC it's mighty curious 
What some folks about me does, 
Whiskey rings and politicians 
Uncle Sam didn't once allow, 
Beat your neighbor and your brothe, 
That's the style they do things now. 
Spoken.—Then they put all their money in a savings 
bank and the cashier runs away with it, the bank bursts 
and everything is— 
CITORUS. 
High cum blink cum, skithly- rink cum, 
Nix cum arous, bow, wow, wow, 
When you get a 
good thing keep it, 
That's the style they do things now. 
Stylish beaux all on the corners, 
At the girls they like to smile, 
Dyed moustache and paper collars, 
Curly hair as slick as " ile," 
Where they get the stamps to back it 
Nobody can tell you how, 
Diamond pins as big as hen's eggs, 
That's the style they do things now. 
Spoken. — Then they meet their girl and have a prome-
nade and go and hear Beecher, and everything is— 
(Chorus). 
Costs a 
heap to dress the ladies, 
Savings banks and coupon bonds, 
High heel boots and chicken feathers:, 
Black and tans and pretty blonde; 
Little dimmers all day walking, 
Won't do housework any how, 
Velocipedes to help them toddle, 
That's the style they do things now. 
Spoken. — Then they come racing along the street (
de-
scription of race on banjo). 
Now they flew. 
Now they're 
flying. 
Now they ain't, 
Now it's a 
dead heat, and the 
girl with the silver heels and auburn curls wins the race 
in 2.45 and carries off the injin rubber cup and every-

Oh! one evening lately, I 
dressed up nately, 
I 
put on my Sunday clothes, plug- hat and all; 
Arid I 
started proudly, while whistling loudly, 
For Neal Brogan's raffle at Hibernia Halt 
Going round a 
corner, a 
gang of rowdies: 
Ohl I 
know they're rowdies for they never work, 
Says, let give this ould Tad a 
racket, 
We will have a 
pic-nic, boys, and toss the Turk.

Now I'm not a 
fighter, nor yet a 
biter. 
But when duty calls me I 
never shirk; 
So I'll tell you plainly, tiro' I 
look ungainly, 
That they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Oh! the big ring-leader, a 
free lunch raider, 
Says, " O'Brien you had better paint the ' tile,' 
Put crape around it, get an axe and pound it!" 
And he thought 'twas funny when the gang did smile. 
It was then my dander rose like a 
gander, 
For I 
heard one loafer say he'd flash a 
dirk: 
So I 
tapp'd him lightly, and surprised him quitely, 
And they had no pic-nic when they toss'd the Turk. 
Now I'm not, etc. 
Oh! they gather'd round me, and thought to pound me, 
But I 
put my back against a 
big brick wall; 
You can't go behind me, says I, now mind roe, 
If you stand forenint me I 
can bate ye all. 
The.— the gang did face me and thought to lace me, 
But I 
showed them tricks I 
learned at Donegal; 
Right and left I 
pounded, they were dumbfounded, 
And at last for mercy they 'began to bawl.

I'LL tell you of a

And of a

The neighbors called him Squinty Dan, 
And she long-legged Sal. 
They lived down on Centre Street, 
And loved each other well; 
And its o. a 
dismal history, 
That now I'm going to tell. 
Now Souinty Dan he had red hair, 
And looked two ways for Monday, 
I:e peddled clams around the street, 
On every day but Sunday 
lint Sundays Squinty Dan would go 
To court, long-legged Sal, 
And take her to ride in his clam-barouche 
On the banks. of Gowanus canal. 
He used to feed her on clam-soup, 
Clam- chowder, and clam-pie, 
And send her lots of long-necked 
For her to roast and fry: 
Till the neighbors gals, through jeaitit,;y, 
Made up a 
horrid plan 
To freeze the love in the bosom of 
I 
ler darling Squinty Dan. 
When Squinty Dan heard the news, 
He climbed to a 
chimney- top, 
If.. pulled a 
pound of powder out, 
And down he let it drop:

fearful roar 
And blowed him so lar on high),

Dedicated to EDWARD HARRIGAN.' 
By JOHN ERIGENA BARRETT, Author of "-Love and Labor." 
0, THE summer of life is a 
joyous time 
When the eye is undimm'd by care, 
When the bosom responds to each thought sublime. 
And each prospect on earth is fair, 
'When love lights his lamp at each beautiful shrine 
And whispers we'll never grow old, 
When happiness lingers in lips half divine 
Whose smiles are more precious than gold.,

Then let age do its worst 
In this wide world of strife, 
It can never rob me 
Of the Summer of Life. 
They say friends prove false and that pleasure's 
shrmn 
That passes from the touch like a 
dream. 
But while youth is mine I'll be just what I 
am, 
And never endeavor to seem 
A slave unto sorrow or whitening hairs; 
Let time march along, I'll be gay; 
Let those who enjoy them have troubles and cares, 
But I'll have mirth while I 
may. 
Then let oire, etc. 
If wrinkles should come then I'll laugh them away; 
They cannot abide where there's cheer, 
With a 
jolly ha. ha, they never can stay, 
No wrinkles for me while I'm here. 
But sunshine and laughter and song to the last, 
And some one I 
love for my wife, 
Then the tempests may howl, the frosts may fall rast, 
I'll bask in the Summer of Life. 
Then let old age do its worst, ete.

The roses have bloomed for the last 
The violets are folded to rest, 
The daisies and butter-cups lying 
Entomb'd on the pimpernel's breast; 
The meadow lark's song has abated, 
The robin chirps high on its way 
To the land of the magnolia flowers, 
For the Summer is dying to-day. 
The forest with green blended yellow, 
Is changing its hue to the sere; 
The orchard with fruit ripe and mellow, 
Proclaim ' tis the end of the year, 
When flowers shall bloom in their beauty, 
And birds sing their happiest lay— 
The harvest is all garnered safely, 
For the Summer is dying to-day. 
Dying! yes, flowers and humanity, 
Fond affections and friends we deemed pUrG, 
Dead are the feelings of others 
To the sorrows we may endure. 
liappy thought! bless'd the vision 
May we all leave a

To that land of the bright Elysium,

Through the Woods we Wandered. 
Written and composed by W. H. D ELEHANTY. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Little Maud and I; 
Leisurely meandered, 
Giving sigh for sigh. 
Blithe and merry-hearted, 
Arm-in-arm we went; 
All our loves imparted, 
Blest with sweet content. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Lovely Maud and me; 
But awhile we pondered, 
Near a 
shady tree. 
There she turned and faced me, 
Something sweet to say; 
Trustingly embraced me, 
In her tender way. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
Maud and I 
alone; 
Where a 
brook ran onward, 
Making gentle moan. 
We had pulled two posies, 
Bound them side by side; 
When we made proposes, 
Threw them in the tide. 
Thro' the woods we wandered, 
While the little stream; 
Bore these pledges onward, 
Bonds of our love dream. 
Secret vows we plighted, 
Sacred love and faith; 
Like those flowers united, 
Ever until death.

With cheeks like cherries red; 
She's a

I'm only twelve months wed. 
When I

After toiling all the day,

Arrah can't you mind the child! 
Tie it up in an over-coat, 
She's surely going wild. 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, 
Mind the child awhilel 
She'll kick and bite, 
And cry all night, 
Arrah Patrick mind the child. 
There was castor-oil, and soothing syrup, 
And paregoric to, 
Was give to the child when she had fits, 
But nothing would bring her to; 
She'd put mustard plasters on her feet, 
And give her a 
bowl of tea, 
And then she'd lay her in my arms, 
And this to me would say— 
Arrah Patrick mind the baby, M. 
Ah when Nelly grew up to a 
lady, 
I 
had no control at tall; 
She'd say I 
am no baby, 
As she waltz away to a

And blackens up his eye. 
If a

We all went fishing with clothes lines, 
And got chock full of rye, 
I 
caught an eel and made him squeal, 
How is that for high. 
In the woodbine twineth darling. 
You shall be my bride. 
Put me in my little bed, 
With Maggie by my side. 
She whispered in my ear, now love, 
Should you not prove true, 
In the lane, when the clock strikes twe, 
I'll put a 
head on you. 
When next I 
saw this beauty, 
She was sitting in the bower, 
As though to please such flower. 
'Twas there we got acquainted, 
It really seemed a

To be speaking to a 
venus, 
Like this truly rural queen, 
She listened to my wooing, 
Let me clasp her hands in mine, 
Her voice like music whispered. 
Originally sung by BILLY CARTER. 
Oh, Birdie, I

I 
do not care for an exhibition of your vocal abilities,

I'm sleepy too, the approach of slumber is apparent,

For I 
my evening devotion have uttered, 
I'm infinitely fatigued and fain would seek repose, 
So put me in that resting place designated by the usual ap-

Oh, Birdie, repeat the ejaaalations of our maternal protector 
When she to the abode of eternal bliss was summoned 
She told me always to assume a 
disposition of amiabiliV, 
A.nd never, never stray from the paths of virtue and prudence. 
rn ne'er forget the day her spirit departed from its modtal, 
casket. 
She placed her digits upon my devoted cranium, 
And whispered softly, retain my obedient offspring, 
And then I 
received information to the effect that she had 
shuffled oft this mortal coil. 
Come affectionate, Jr.c.

FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY MADE. 
BANJO SOLO. 
(New air.) 
Written and composed by SAM DEVERI. 
Deception just now is the rule all around, 
Its practiced in all shades of life; 
Just mind what I 
say, and be careful my friends, 
When the time comes to pick out a 
wife. 
Her eyes may be loving, her smile may be sweet, 
When you approach her she's timid and afraid: 
Be careful look well before making the leap, 
You don't know how the dear girl is made. 
In the good days of old, in our grand-mothers' time, 
Girls did'nt enamel or paint: 
Didnt' wear palpitators their bosoms to swell, 
Didnt' lace themselves up till they'd faint; 
Didn't wear patent calves, or use bloom of youth, 
And the rose in their cheeks di'dnt fade: 
You must know a 
girl well now before you get stuck, 
For she's fearfully and wonderfully made. 
Girls long ago didnt' pencil their brows, 
Use lotions to make the skin fair; 
The girls long ago combed the hair on their heads, 
Now its combed on the back of a 
chair. 
I 
got more to tell when I 
see you alone, 
I 
have said too much here I'm afraid, 
But betore you get married, examine them well, 
For they're fearfully and wonderfully made.

Cease thy weeping, sadden'd heart, 
Brighter days are on the way, 
And the clouds so drear and dark, 
All will surely pass away. 
Flow'rs of spring will come again, 
Blooming sweetly o'er the lea, 
And the warblers of the grove 
Songs of love will chant for thee.

Oh, cease thy weeping sadden'd heart, 
Drive away all idle fears, 
Let those clouds of grief and care 
Melt away in silent tears. 
Cease thy weeping sadden'd heart, 
Why thy face so wan and pale, 
Has thy friend in death been laid 
'Ne,ath the grasses of the vale? 
All! there is a 
fairer land, 
Where we meet no more to part, 
Let this cheer thee, gentle one, 
Let this soothe thy sadden'd heart. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, &c. 
Cease thy weeping sadden'd heart. 
Has thy loved one prov'd untrue, 
Has he broken every vow 
That he promis'd only you ? 
Weep not for him gentle maid. 
He who would both woo and win, 
Then turn traitor to his word, 
Deep has drank of darker sins. 
Oh, cease thy weeping, &e.

American Fortune-Telling Cards.—This is tne old-
est and most widely known pack of Fortune-Telling Cards. We have 
published it for years, and the demand is continually increasing. 
These Cards are arr2,nged and printed in series—Hearts, Clubs, Dia-
monds and Spades—and each or these into K for King. Q for Queen, 
and E 
for Knave, and numbers 1, 3, to 10. 
The Cards are arranged in 
four rows, and are to be read according to directions. 
Many ot the an. 
ewers depend upon the position certain cards bear to other cards. 
The 
method of playing is somewhat complicated, but the directions have 
been made so that very little study will suffice to an ordinary under-
standing. 
Many professional Fortune-Tellers use these cards, and we 
are in receipt of letters in relation to them from all parts of the U. S. 
Zuclosed in handsome case

Courting Cards.—This Series of Cards has been arranged 
loc. meet a 
want frequently felt by young people—a want of means o( 
expressing one's sentiments in such a way as to be non-oommittaL 
Many young ladies are visited by gentlemen who are either too chill. 
dent or too fearful of a 
repulse, to venture upon asking the momentous 
question. The lady is restrained, by custom and a 
sense of propriety, 
from doing anything that would seem to be an unlady-like encourage-
ment. As a 
result of this dilemma, many lives are spent as an unloved 
tedious existence, which might have been prolonged and enjoyed in the 
happiness of matrimony. This pack of Cards will overcome the diffi-
culty, and being in the shape of questions and answers, will cover every 
phase of courtship. 
The sentiments conveyed therein need not be 
adopted by, the parties to the game as their own, unless it accords with 
the state of their affections, which fact makes further explanation un-
necessary. The playing of these Cards is not restricted to two players, 
but may be enjoyed by evening parties

"A 
Little Book has lately appeared in print at Mr. A. J. Fromm's, 98 Nair 
flan street ca ! led the 
Little Flirt." We cannot say that we recommend 
it to our young lady and gentlemen readers, as we think it would only 
encourage the bad habit of " flirting." 
Unfortunately, there is enough 
of it done without any further necessity of explaining " how, when and 
whereto do it," and this little volume would advise and initiate the ure 
earrupted in practicing what is commonly called "flirting." 
the N. Y. Eeening Telegram writes: " We ha--e 
lately seen 
nest little 
book, bound in Morocco leather, costing :eventy-five cents, called the 
•A Little Flirt," published by A. J. FISHER, No. 98 Nassau street. 
It 
gives information of the raodue oprrandi of flirting, and of the meaning 
of every motion of the handkerchief, fan, glove and parasol. 
As there 
is nothing at all objectionable in the volume, and its contents might af-
ford some innocent amusement to many, we do not hesitate to recent-
mend it to our young lady and gentlemen readers."
