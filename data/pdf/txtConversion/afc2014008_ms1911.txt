Some fifty miles west of Ventura lies San Francis-
quito Canyon, a narrow gorge that runs roughly north and south,
 
linking the San Joaquin and Santa Clara Valleys.  Though briefly
 
the scene of placer mining activity and of stage co -
routes, the
 
Canyon was, and is today, a lonely spot.  In 1926, however, the
 
once-great St. Francis Dar
n was completed there; spanning the Canyon
 
about half-way up the length, it was a monument to the determination
 
of Los Angeles authorities to support the further expansion of
 
that already expanding metropolis.  The St. Francis Dam was one
 
link in the growing aqueduct system, designed essentially to re-
route the waters of the southern Sierras from such river outlets
 
as the Santa Clara into Los Angeles proper.  It was constructed
 
by the Los Angeles Bureau of Water and Power under the personal
 
direction of its Chief Engineer, William Mulholland. 2 
On March 11, 1928, the reservoir behind the St.
 
Francis Dam held enough storage water to supply Los Angeles for
 
two and one-half months -
-
 approximately twelve billion gallons.
 
At midnight, on March 12th, the dam collapsed.  An eighty foot
 
high wall of water advanced between the narrow upper walls of Sar
i
 
5rancisquito Canyon down to the Santa Clara river bed, where it
 
spread out to flood an area sixty miles wide.
 
Four hundred houses in the upper valley between
 
Piru and the dant vanished, leaving no trace; at Santa Paula, three
 
hundred houses were destroyed.  Saticoy was partially inundated;
 
the city of Oxnard ordered evacuated.  Cai .S i s (most recently
 
2
 
estimated as between four hundred and four hundred and fifty) were
 
high because of the time of the break, many of the victims being
 
found in their nightclothes.  Most were not drowned but crushed
 
by boulders and wreckage; chunks of concrete from the dam as large
 
as bungalows were later found down the canyon as far as a half a
 
mile.
 
Faced with a barrage of hostile newspaper editorials
 
and the erection of home-made signs -
-
 "Kill Mulholland!" -
-
 up
 
and down the Santa Clara Valley, the Los Angeles authorities acted
 
with commendable rapidity, offering not only clean-up assistance
 
but restoration, as far as possible, and recompense.  Through the
 
offices of the hastily assembled "Committee of Fourteen", made up
 
of representatives of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, some five
 
and a half million dollars was paid out to individual claimants
 
1- 
-
-
 
without resort to the cour
an almost unique chapter in history.
 
As
  
Overall, the total cost of the disaster, including the loss of the
 
dam itself, was above thirteen and a half million dollars.
 
Engineering investigations into the cause of the
 
dam failure were equally swift and efficient.  It was generally con-
cluded that the construction of the dam proper was not at fault;
 
.t
 t1 
suspicion
 -
 L 1
 centered upon the site itself: on a well-known
 
but supposedly "dead" fault, the entire east wall of the dam resting
 
upon conglomerate rocks and shales, samples of which "softened into
 
a soft mushy mass when placed in water".
 
Though the humanitarian motives of the individuals
 
involved in these compensatory and investigative activities are
 
unquestion
)it must be pointed out that the political climate of the
 
times was warm in the extreme.  Passions engendered by the rural-
urban struggle over the Owens Valley water rights were still high;
 
furthermore a bill to finance the construction of Boulder Dam
 
was just then before the national Congress.  It was clearly to the
 
interests of the pro-aqueduct faction to get the whole mess (
in
 
every sense of the word) cleaned up as soon as possible.  This may
 
account for the disparity pointed out by Charles Outland in the
 
amount and detail of the written records concerning the St. Francis
 
Dam break as compared to those concerned with the San Francisco
 
earthquake and fire, which had occurred only twenty-two years before
 
4)
 
and caused no higher a death toll.  Until Mr. Outland's book ap-
peared, the only accounts of the St. Francis dam break were to be
 
found in newspapers, magazines and other ephemera; the San Francisco

disasterA has been discussed and re-discussed in innl2merable pub-
lished sources.
 
On March 12, 1928, however, the Chicano and Anglo
 
farmers who bat worked their crops in the Santa Clara valley were
 
not concerned with the political struggles which lay behind,and
 
were to arise from)the St. Francis dam break.  They had more im-
mediate problems.  Sr. Juan Encinas, whose parents had come to
 
the valley from Sonora, Mexico in the 1880's, may be taken as ex-
ample.
 Sr. Encinas, born in 1891, had lived all his life on his
 
family's farm near the small town of Piru in the central Santa
 
Clara Valley.  Now his home town lay almost completely destroyed;
 
the flood waters had come within a half-mile of his house; many of
 
his dearest friends and neighbors had been killed.  And he had a
 
sad responsibility to discharge that day, for his sister was seri-
ously ill at her home in another part of the valley.  Someone had
 
to break the news to her and tell her, among other grim details,
 
 
I
 
4)
 
that her coinpadre (godfather) had died in the flood.
 
r.  Ecinas decided to compose a ballad about the
 
events he had seen.  He used "an old t
ime", the original words to
 
which he could not later remember; 5 still, it took him a whole day
 
to be satisfied with his efforts.
 On March 13th, two days after
 
lhe dam break, he journeyed to his sister's house and told her he
 
would sing her a song if she would promise not to cry.  This -
-
as he recalled it in 1960, at the age of sixty-eight -
-
 is his
 
ballad:

The folk ballad of northern Mexico and the border
 
states is called, by its composers and performers, the corrido, 
a term stemming from the verb "correr, which means '
to run' or
 
,to flow ,, for the corrido tells a story swiftly and simply, with—
 
out embellishment."

Corridos are stanzaic in structure, typically lack—
 
ing refrains, each verse being composed of four octosyllabic lines
 
with a rhyme scheme of abcb, a form showing close kinship with the
 
rhymed couplet.  In complement to the rhyme scheme, the corrido
  
stanza most frequently comprises a pair of statements, each two
 
lines in length.  The balanced binary structure of the individual
 
stanzas may be extended to the entire ballad, where one often finds
 
the number of verses devoted to an introductory statement paralleled
 
by the same number of verses devoted to the despedida, or formal
 
close.
 
Though repetition of lines within a corrido is not
 
a significant characteristic, repetition of lines from corrido to
 
corrido is frequent, as there is a large stock of free—floating
 
lines available to the composer within the corrido tradition.  Avot}
r
 
characteristic in common with the traditional British ballad is
 
the use of direct conversation, both to hurry the story along and
 
to create a "You are there" effect upon the listeners.  Again, par—
 
allel binary structure -
-
 so frequent a feature of traditional cor
n—
 
position -
-
 is evident, in that one two—line unit is often devoted
 
to a direct statement, followed by another two—line unit of response.

It is important to note that, when Sr. Encinas re-
corded his borrido in 1960, he sang no other corridos, though his
 
repertoire included other forms of Mexican song.  Even so, at the
 
time he composed "El Corrido de la Inundacion de la Presa de San
 
Francisquito", it is plain he must either have known other corridos
  
or have been thoroughly familiar with the tradition.  His ballad,
 
though
 -
 •LLr
 J_ .I
 j  not the work of a highly
 
experienced corrido composer, fits all the basic characterizers
 
just outlined.
 
The first two verses introduce the situation to be
 
described, put it in an historical framework and touch upon the per-
formance;  (
corrido singers, bard-like, always refer in one way or
 
another to the fact that they, as individuals, are bringing a partic-
ular audience the news about something).  The two introductory
 
stanzas are paralleled by the two concluding verses in which the
 
singer takes his leave.  The rhyme scheme, syllabification and other
 
formal poetic characteristics of the "classic" corrido form are care-
fully observed.  The ballad also includes, among other less well-
known quotations, the traditional T
iVuela,
 vuela palomita" -
-
 a line
 
which occurs as frequently in the corrido as does "Who's going to
 
hoe your pretty little foot?" in the Anglo-American ballad tradition.
 
Finally, in its construction, Sr. Encinas' composition
 
follows point for point the content model of the typical corrido
  
outlined by McDowell: 8)

)
 
One must salute the sheer power of traditional models; Sr. Encinas
 
may have written only one corrido in his entire life, but it is
 
abundantly clear that, when he needed and wanted to write one, he
 
knew just how it should be done.
 
All this, however, does not satisfy the most humanly
 
interesting question in the story of Sr. Encinas and his corrido: 
why did he write it anyway?  Why, faced with his tragic duty, did
 
Sr. Encinas linger to compose a song about the events he had seen,
 
when
. he could have simply told his sister the same story so much
 
more easily and directly?
 
Any answer that might be suggested to this question
 
must be completely tentative, for Sr. Enem as is now dead.a W Quite
 
h
e 
AW
 
probably
, -- like almost all creative artists 
 -
 -  
could not have ex-
plained his act, had he ever been asked;  It likely enough simply
 
"felt" like the right thing to do at the time.  This brings us to
 
the e
5ge of a largely unexplored territory: the genesis of the
 
creative act.
 Studies of the contexts and processes of composition
 
on the level of the traditional artist have been lamentably few;
 
still, there are some observations that might be made.
 
It appears, for one thing, that the tendency to general-
ize or fictionalize personal experience so characteristic of urban
 
or formally educated creative artists is not shared by traditional
 
composers.  Sophisticates often are made uncomfortable to discover
 
that the early country composer, Jimmy Rogers, wrote hisA
 series of
 
"T.B. Blues" quite simply because he himself had tuberculosis and
 
knew he was dying of it.
 (
It would have been "nicer", somehow, if
 
 
I
 
8)
 
he had just written about someone else's tubercular condition; or
 
he could, of course, have written out of his own personal experience
 
but, in that case, he should at least have changed the disease.)
 
Frank Hamilton, a local guitarist and city-bred
 
folk singer, once told me that he had been so moved by the scenes
 
of a local train wreck shown on Los Angeles television stations
 
that he had written a ballad about the tragedy.  When he sang his
 
song the following night to hisAcoffee
 house audience, it was re-
ceived not only coldly but with scattered booing.  Frank was ter-
ribly upset.
 "They seemed to feel I was using the accident or
 
something," he told me.
 "It looks like it's all right if I sing
 
about a train wreck that happened a hundred years ago, or in New
 
York Stateg or something, but not about one that really might touch
 
anybody personally."
 
+L
 
As Frank pointed out, the city audience uses 
A time
 
and distance to give itself breathing room -
-
 a wide social space
 
within which the direct crunch of personal commtr
nication can be
 
diffused and dissipated.  Country audiences seem not quite as
 
squeamish.  John Szwed reports that the most popular song by the
 
local bard in a Newfoundland community was the one he had written
 
about himself, stressing his anomalous position as a bachelor. 10)
 
Bachelorhood in that rural area, Szwed points out, was so unusual
 
a state as to be considered comical; on a deeper level, however,
 
in an isolated community dependent upon shared familial obligations
 
and reciprocities, it was also threatening.  Paul E. Hall, the
 
local bachelor song-writer, was asked to sing his "funny" song
 
about himself again and again.

Dear Scott:

I am sorry to have taken so long getting the corrido manuscript
 
back to you.  The collector of the original song had a few correct-
ions she wanted made; they are simple enough -
 I haven't the least
 
idea why I
've stalled so lo n
g over the process.
 
There is one thing I should make "perfectly clear".  Phil  onnich-
sen has not checked the entire mss., and shouldn't be held respon-
sible for any errors it may contain.  I mention this in case you
 
want to send it to him for checking; I know D.K. calls him in oc-
casionally in reference to matters Hispanic.  Actually, I think
 
even the transcription of the corrido text has been slightly
 
edited since he went over it for me.
 
I
've one further favor to ask.  D.K. wrote that it couldn't come
 
out until 1974; if my delay in returning the final editing has
 
resulted in further delay, could you (or he) let me know?  I still
 
think the logical place for it is Western Folklore, but if it's
 
going to take another couple of years to get it out, it occurs to
 
me that perhaps Paredes might know of a Chicano publication that
 
would be interested,or especiallyiin need of manuscripts.

Dear D.K.;
 
L
erewIth my latest: a major revision ol a paper I read at a C
T$ meeting many
 
years ago.  I have the impression that you are choked with manuscripts, but
 
this is so clearly concerned with California folklore that I can't think where
 
else to send it.  If you have not use for it, perhaps you could suggest some-
v t
hee èIse?crowded  editorial home?
 
In case footnote 1 is not quite clear, Phil Sonnischen has only seen the corrido 
itself and should not be held in any way responsible for any of my possibly
 
heretical opinions or possible errors.  Phil feels very strongly, by the way,
 
that lyric translations from the Spanish should be as close to word-for--word
 
as nossible; the results seem awkward to me but I bowed to his editorial
 
opinion.  should
 
i
r ed U;orial O
f
liOf
l differ, I would opt for a bit more
 
g
raceful expression.
 
Cordially

Within a traditional community, local songs written
 
in that tradition may then serve not to "bring the news" nor to tell
 
a story from so long ago or so far away as to have only secondary
 
impact, but to formalize -
-
 and thus depersonalize to a degree -
-
a story or situation known to all.  Even rural audiences demand
 
some degree of emotional protection, though it seems to a lesser ex-
tent than their urban cousins.  And this may explain the extraordinary
 
lasting power of the traditional compositional models: that the care-
f
iil observance of formal and stylistic characteristics required
 
to satisfy the models properly, provides the' emotional shielding
 
essential both to the composer and his audience.
 
The Black prisoner, referring to his long sentence,
 
sings:
 
Don't talk about it,
 
'Bout it, if you do, I
'll cry...
 
But what he cannot speak of without tears, he still can sing.
 It
 
seems quite possible that Sr. Encinas, in writing his corrido, was
 
doing all he could to help not only his sister -
-
 but himself, as
 
well -
-
 not to cry.
 
"l Corriclo de la Inundacion de la Presa de San
 
FrancisQuito" is not in itself an important song, certainly not a
 
"big" song.  There is no evidence that anyone other than Sr. Encinas
 
ever sang it, or, indeed, that until he recorded it for his niece,
 
anyone outside his family ever even heard it.  It tells only those
 
details of the disaster which were of direct significance to the
 
Encinas family; possibly -
-
 even probably -
-
 there were other St.
 
Francis Dar
n corridos by other now unknown corridistas that we shall
 
never hear.
 In a way, this does not matter; art has always been
 
expendable, and songs, like people, are born and die every day.
 
miiy songs, the songs of only local interest, is to bring t
 
close to the ever-marvellous thrust of human creativity, to t
 
unstoppable determination of ordinary men to give dignity and
 
pattern to their life experience.  And it may cause us also i
.
 
iook with even greater respect at the subtle structures of thu
 
u
t
 ui mu  t
hrou h which these.-

Saint Francis Dam
 
This article comments upon the genesis of the creative act, through a
 
detailed examination of a single traditional narrative song, or ballad.
 
The known historical facts of the St. Francis Dam break of 1928 in the Santa
 
Clara Vall y of Southern California provide only background to the individual
 
perspective of the ballad composer, a local Chicano farmer, who wrote his
 
account of the disaster, as he had experienced it, in the form of a corrido, 
a Spanish-language ballad form.  The words and music of his corrido show close
 
adherence to the compositional rules governing this song form and demonstrate
 
the xx crucial importance of traditional models to the folk composer.  However,
 
this same quality of formalism also demonstrates that the primary function of
 
the topical song in a rural or traditional community is less to report upon,
 
than to commemorate, an event of significance within that community.

Dear Bess:
 
I' m sure we can bring out the corrido
  
piece in 1974.
 However,  the January issue
 
is a special religious number.
 I have two
 
folksong articles accepted,  and if there are
 
no space problems  (one is a huge item on
 
Ukrainian songs,  and the other on a Finnish
 
ballad)  the corrido item should fit well---
hopefully in the April issue.
 
Another item:
 Vilmos Voight of Budapest
 
(now teaching at Berkeley)  will be talking on
 
developments in Hungarian folklore studies at
 
UCLA,  3 p. m.  30 November,  Room 2209A,  Bunche
 
Hall.
 Please come and bring or push any other
 
interested parties.
 
There will be a reception for Vilmos,  5-7 p. m.
 
at our home in Santa Monica.
 Please come.

Dear Bess:
 
I would like very much to publish your
 
corrido paper.
 With the current backlog,  it
 
cannot appear until probably April 1974 or
 
later.
 I hope this will not be too long a
 
delay.
